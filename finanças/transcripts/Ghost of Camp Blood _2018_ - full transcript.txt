- Well, what are you waiting for? Kill me! Kill me. I thought you were dead. - I don't go down that easy. Where are the others? Are you sure? - Lizzie might have made to the road? I just don't know. - It's a mess this is turning out to be. - I found the car. Let me help you. We can make it. She didn't start earlier. - She floods real easily. Go gentle on the gas pedal. Now, let's get the hell outta here. - Amen to that. - It's a good thing you stumbled across the vehicle. - It was hidden pretty well. We wouldn't ever seen it from the main road where we parked. - Who would've known clowns can drive cars? - I guess Lizzie's intuition was right. It just seems like it hasn't actually happened. - This is so surreal. - What do we do now? - Call the police, get them up here to clean this mess up. - This is just more than just a mess. This is a nightmare. - We should just be happy we're alive. - You, hold it right there! - Welcome back to Live News Channel 7. We just received word that police are closing in on the notorious Camp Blood killer, identified by authorities as Stan Cunningham. He's believed to have been responsible for over 27 murders in the last decade. Targeting victims in the Blackwood area. His motives were unknown but a countrywide crackdown led authorities to him home where a search uncovered dozens of murder weapons, photos of victims and several clown masks. Locals are relieved but still frightened by terror legacy. - I can't believe it, I really can't believe it. I've known Stan Cunningham all my life. The guy was just, I don't know, normal guy, your average guy, nice guy, quiet, kept to himself. I can't believe that he would murder all those people. When I heard the news, I was just shocked. Really shocking. - I really don't wanna talk wanna talk about this, okay? Just leave me alone. Did you hear what I said? Leave me alone. - To let these kind of sick people walk the streets without, you know, the proper healthcare or mental healthcare or, it's just, it's scary. I mean, you know, I. - We have been told that the fugitive killer have been cornered in an alley. And he's now in a showdown with the police. More breaking news as we receive it. - Freeze! - Well, Randy, I have some bad news. Your show, Voice from Beyond, is tanking in the ratings. Our sponsors are pulling out and move in to the home and garden hour. - What? You're joking. - I wish I was. Look at these ratings. It's really bad. - Look, I know we've had a few bad months. The Halloween is coming. It'll pick up. It always does. - Not good enough. We need the time slot for program that makes us money. Two years, I've held on and we keep sinking. I have to cut it. You understand. - No, I don't. - Let me put it to you this way. Your show is over. Done. Do you understand that? - People love this crap. - No on our station. There's too many competitive programs. Better ones. We tried. - Give me one more chance, please. - No can do. I got the barking orders from the head office. - My contract says you owe me six more shows. - We both know what contracts are worth. - I guess I'll have to take my hot new concept to WGFN then. - Yeah, and what is that? - A program on the Camp Blood killer. Stan Cunningham. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold it. That's hot! Real hot! And trendy. - Yeah, well, someone else is getting it. I'm done, remember? - Let's back up a bit. What if we work out a deal? - What good is a deal if a contract can't be upheld? - I'm serious. Listen, I'll talk to the brass and hold off on this garden program. You deliver me a knockout show about Camp Blood and we might be able to get you extended for a year, and a better time slot. - Yeah? - Yeah, trust me. - That's the part I don't like. - Well? - Deal. - Don't let me down. - And don't worry. This one's gonna blow the others away. Stan Cunningham a.k.a. the Camp Blood Killer. Reportedly to have slain over 27 people. All in the vicinity of Camp Blackwood, known by locals as Camp Blood. And now, infamous area, off limits to anyone. No one knows what drove him to commit these murders. Some say a jealous rage over a scorned lover. Other boil it down to a mad blood lust, unchecked and out of control. He's weapon of choice were various long-bladed machetes. Sometimes, an ax. Sometimes, his bare hands. Each murder was bloody and vicious. Several clues and tips led authorities to Stan who was gunned down in a dark alley. Even to the end, it is said he brandished his machete. No one knows where his body is buried. Well, my friend, you're gonna make history again. Now, it's gonna be of no harm in this world. We'll see what you can tell us from the other side. 11 o'clock?

This place is in ruins. Everything in ruins! This place is overgrown. It reeks of murder and death! - Looks like someone's blood here. - Probably everywhere here.

Join us for the most important hour of the year. Randy Spark's Voices From Beyond. - Oh god, he does need our help. - Ooh, let's play a game. - Oh, brother. - Oh, come on, it'll be fun. - Okay, what? - What is the grizzliest Camp Blood murder that you know of? - Good one. Who goes first? - Okay, I will. Hmm. Let's see. - So many to choose from. - I think one of the gruesomest Camp Blood murders would have to be that of the victim that was strangled with her own intestines. - Really? Gross! - Good one but I think it have to be one, it have to be the wheelchair bound victim stabbed in the head and slashed to pieces. - Mine is more savage. The one with the hunter is killed with a road flare right in his face! Ugh, gruesome! - Why do you think Stan Cunningham killed all those people? - If only he really knows for sure. So we contact the spirit? We'll find out. - Do you think he can still kill beyond the grave? - Sounds like a cheap movie. - Seriously? - Anything is possible, I suppose. I've heard of poltergeist harming people. Biting and scratching but never any deaths. - It would take a lot of energy, a lot of hate to physically harm somebody from the grave. - Let's hope we're not the first to find out. I'm gonna give Randy Bucks a call and see we're in or out regards to his show. Hey Randy, it's AJ. I wanna call, it's Ghost Hunters. I phoned up with agency see if we can help in your show. We filmed some rad B-roll footage of Camp Blood today and found the sign. Sure do. Thank you so much. See you tomorrow. We're in. - Ooh, awesome. - It's fantastic! He sure did have a change of heart. - He knows raw talent when he sees it. - Or just a couple of suckers. - Yeah, this is Harley. No, I have the money for you. I just scored a job that paid well. Tell him first he still get what I owe. Nothing more. He's getting real greedy. Yeah, same place, phone boot by first and fifth. Later. It's time I find an honest profession. Who the hell are you? You know, you're trespassing. Hey, I stole that mask for Randy Banks. Who are you? Banks, if you're here to get your money back, beat it. A deal is a deal. Okay, funny guy. I hope you have clown insurance. No, no! - We're at your disposal. - Thanks so much for the opportunity to work with you. - I'm a damn good camera person. - Great. I think we'll work well together. It's all well and good as long you have a fortitude. - We can handle it. We've seen all kinds of paranormal activities that would turn a ghost white. - You've never dealt with a spirit of a homicidal maniac before, have you? - Well, no. Not exactly. - Stan Cunningham, the Camp Blood killer is serious business. When we make contact with him, he may try and lash out to harm one of us. - We've all been poked and prodded by ghost before. - I'm talking more than that. Physical harm is reality. Strangling. He may try to throw an object at you, stab you. Do you see what I mean? You still in? - Do we have anything physical that we contact the spirit with? - We sure do. - My god, is that? - The killer's actual mask, yes. - How did you? - Don't worry about how I got it. Point is I have it and this will be our strongest link between our world and his. - It's creepy. Can you guy's feel it? It's almost as if it's emitting some sort of energy. - Those are some bad vibes, man. - Other than the actual murder weapons themselves, this right here is the strongest tie between Stan Cunningham and his sick twisted world. - What's the plan? - I have it on good authority that tan Cunningham's body is buried in a remote location near the vicinity of Camp Blood. - We're all over the place and we didn't see it. - Then you didn't look hard enough, kid. - Okay, okay. - Once we find it, then what? - Cecil B. DeMille here will film. We'll make contact and capture the whole event. We'll set his spirit free. The mask being the link. Then we'll bury it next to him. The bloody legacy, closed. - What if he doesn't wanna go? - Why wouldn't he? - He was going to a place he'd be welcome. Would you rather stick around here? - Good observation. But we'll do our best to convince him that it's over. - When do we start? - Right now, today. - How far back this Camp Blood would go? When was it open? - I think it started as summer kids' retreat back in the 60s. - Yeah, that's right, 1968. - I guess today's summer camps are a thing of the past. - This one sure is. - Now, I went to some camps a few times as a kid. - Yeah, did you like it? - Yeah, it's all right. Fun, actually. - Did you tell scary ghost stories? - Yeah, among other things. - What urban legends are popular in your day? - Ah, you know, the usual stuff. The Hook at lover's lane. Becky's grave, kid wants his liver back. - It all sounds so scary. - Our urban legend was real. - Was real. Passed onto eternity. - Yeah, we'll see about that. Here, we'll use my equipment. I'm sure it's notches above your amateur solute stuff. These are the EVP recorders for when Stan get chatty. - When do we leave for camp? - As soon as it stops raining. Tell you what, guys, wait right here. I'll be right back. - Don't take too long. - What, are you afraid it's gonna get dark? - Yeah, right. - I thought you guys were ready for this. - We'll be fine. - Cemetery could be anywhere. - I'm sure it's old and forgotten. - No wonder he's body's in recent cemetery. - Who could blame them? What is it? - I thought I saw something! - What? - The shape of a person, I think. - There's no one there. - I think Randy is on pinging needles. - Don't worry, it's not the clown. - Yeah, right. - Come on, let's go wait for Randy out in the hall. - Stan Cunningham. Let your spirit still roam this halls. - Are you here? - Yes. - Why don't you leave? - No! - Why? - Work to do! - What work? - Chilly. - Where are you? - I am everywhere. - Randy said he wants us to use his equipment. - Randy isn't here and his equipment's cheaper than ours. Bad funding at the station, maybe? - Might as well do something while we wait. - Why don't we try contacting the killer? - Stan Cunningham, are you here with us? We call on you, Stan Cunningham, killer of Camp Blood. Please, we ask that you make contact. Are you here? - Yes. - Holy crap! - Ssh, don't break communication. We wanna talk to you. - Speak while you can. - Why did you do it? Why did you kill all these innocent people? - Want the true world. - Do you wanna move on? - No. - Why? - Work to do. - What work? - Kill, kill, kill! - AJ, stop! - Kill who? - You! Coming to get all of you. - Randy. Is that you? Why are you dressed like that? - You got us good. Fun is over. - Right, there's something wrong with him. Stan, are you here? Are you possessing Randy right now? Oh shit! - Let's get outta here! - Who's here? - Where he hell is everybody? - Randy's gone crazy! - He's possessed by the spirit of Stan Cunningham. - We need to find somewhere to hide now! - No doubt! - Who's in there? Banks, are you here? Banks, why are all these lights on? You're wasting money and electricity. And I saw a bunch of kids running by. I knew I shouldn't have agreed to that stupid show of his. Who are you? - Aw! What? What is this? We were partners, now you're double crossing me? - News flash, you tried to kill us. - What? I don't remember any of that. - What do you remember? - We were separated. I had the EVP recorder, I was trying to talk to the killer. And I don't know. - I'll fill in the blanks. We're waiting for you when you showed up with the mask and the knife of the killer and proceeded and try and throttle us! - What knife? - The one next to you. - Untie me! Untie me now! We're in danger. - From you! - No, the killer! He must've possessed me. - How do we know that? - Whatever explanation can there be? - You were going to harm us to gain ratings on your TV show. - You know what? That's absurd. Untie me now! - Untie him, he's telling the truth. - He tried to-- - Do it! We're gonna need all the help we can get if we wanna get out here alive. - Aw! Look, whatever I tried to do, I'm sorry. - Sorry for us, clubbing you. - Yeah, I understand, I get it. - The doors were locked. Did you do that? - I don't even remember touching anything. - Great. It's evil, the mask. I sense it. - Now what? - It's still we came here for. We're in a relatively safe place. We have the mask. Let's just set Stan Cunningham free. Get outta here. - Yeah, he's absolutely right. Put the mask down. Let's all sit facing it and see could release his spirit to the other side. Try not to talk all at once. - Don't worry, I think Stan will be doing all the talking. - Let's get started. We're safe if we stick together. - Okay, Randy. - Stan Cunningham, are you here? Are you with us? - Yes. - Why did you possess me? Make me attempt to harm these kids? - Fun. - It was bad. It was a bad thing to do. - Fun not bad. - Why did you do it? - Enjoy watching suffering. Death. - There's no joy in someone's suffering. - There is. Will you suffer for me? - Never! - What do you want? - Mask. Want mask back. - Why? - Seen so much pain. Part of me. - How do we give it back to you? - Outfit. - Outfit? Is it nearby? - Yes. Cold, dark, need mask. - Why don't you cross over? You're done in this plane of existence. - Need mask. Cross threshold then. Light scares me. - You can cross into the light without the mask. - Need mask, please! Need mask! - Where's your outfit so we can return it? - Nearby, very close. - If we give you your mask back, will you cross over? I repeat. If we return the mask, will you cross over? - He's gone. - Yes. - Which direction is it? Your outfit? - North. - Did you get that, kid? - Sure did. - Why is the mask so important anyhow? - If it had significance in his life, it will in his death. He needs to connect with it. While separated, he's restless and roaming the netherworld until he gets it back. - What makes you think he'll cross over once we give it to him? - What are you getting at? - Maybe the mask is just what he needs to comeback in our world. Not crossover to the next. Maybe he's lying. - That's a chance we gonna have to take. Come on. This way. - I think we're off the trail. - He said north. - He's dead. Maybe his sense of direction's off. - Use the mask. - What? - Yeah. If he wants it that bad, he just might lead us right to him. - It's worth the try. - Like a dowsing rod. - I don't like the look of this, guys. - Run. I'll take him on so you could get far away. - You'll be killed. - Just go! - Where? - Try and get outside! Okay, motherfucker, come play with me! No fair, I can't do that. - What kind of game are you playing? - Welcome to my nightmare world where my victims relive their deaths over and over. - No! - No, it's not real. It's an illusion. - It was real and still is. - That's impossible. - You will witness more terror's today. - Figures you for dead. - Likewise. - The spirit of Stan is strong. I've seen horrible visions, nightmares of past victims. - Me too. - What do we do? - Join him! - You said you wanted an interview. Sit. - I'm the host. - Not today. - Today on Voices From Beyond. - I'm the host. Today on Voices From Beyond, we have our guest, Randy Banks, former paranormal investigator. - Former? - Tell us, Randy.
