Iqbal! Iqbal! Iqbal! Who's this? Uncle, isn't Iqbal at home? No son. He went jogging. -Come inside. Come and sit. -It's okay, Uncle. I'll be waiting outside. -Alright. -Okay Who jogs on Sunday mornings? Physical fitness is the most important criteria to become a policeman. That's the reason. -Good morning sir. -Yes, good morning. Come on, move on. Where is Kumar Shekhar sir? Why are you obsessed with become a police officer? It's not an obsession. What do they call it? Yes! That's passion! They are not as excited as you are. You've tried for the last three years to get into the police force but they have settled for another job... only because the department hasn't notified jobs for the year yet. That is, will there be no notifications for SI post this year too sir? Wait another year. Good luck. Come on guys. What? Had he really tried since last three years to get into the police department? What's so special about the job? Look, he's coming! Ask yourself. -Hi, guys. -Hi! Wow! Is this your new car? Yes. We've been hanging around around town all night. Did your father give it to you? Why did he buy me? I bought it with my own salary. Wages? It's not with the salary, he bought it at EMI. Did you find a job like me, you too could buy a bike if not a car! Hi, Auntie. -Hi. -Hi, Auntie. -Hello, Auntie. -Hi! Hi, Auntie. Everyone's here! Turn on the TV. There is no end to cruelty to girls. Unidentified corpse has found near Kovvur bridge. We witnessed an incident where a girl was gang raped, post which, brutally murdered and dumped along the way. Our correspondent Hari presents to you detailed information about this incident. Yes, Sumathi... The doctors have done a postmortem on the girl's body found last night. The girl has been identified and her parents have been notified. They have identified the body as that of their daughter. The surprising fact in this case is that... The girl has been missing since yesterday morning. The girl's father has approached the police to file an FIR about the same... but police department has not only failed to take any action regarding this matter, but also didn't even file FIR for the same. Why isn't an FIR filed? This is a heartbreaking incident, Suma. The police are busy with security arrangements... for the event at the Minister's farmhouse. And it has been referred to as reasons for not filing an FIR. Do you think that the girl's death was due to the failure of the police department? Of course Suma. See! This is a police department situation. They are puppets of the rich and politicians. They don't care about the commoners. Hey! How is Iqbal related to that? He is passionate about becoming a police officer. But after entering the major, his whole life will revolve around politicians, power and money. Who knows? He might change. Who knows? Everyone join forces with this same intention. But after getting into it, does anyone gain the respect a true police officer deserves? It's okay if you don't serve the public but. You should at least take care of your parents. Even at this age, you still depend on them pension amount because of your obsession with policing. If you let go of this obsession, I will refer you to a job at the company where I work now. Okay, buddy. Find me a job. Don't change your mind because of him. It wasn't because of him. I've been thinking about my family lately. Just hold on to those words, You will have a job in your hands in just a week. -See you. -Goodbye. Goodbye. Let's go. Why do you say that, son? We all have the same ambition that you have to be inspector. You want to see me as inspector since you retired as a cop. I tried many years just for your sake but what will I achieve by joining forces, father? Only after I worked with that one inspector... then I realized what a police officer can really achieve. I wish you to be inspector just for inspiration. Who's he? What did he achieve? If anyone wants to achieve something... They have to set goals. It's not a big deal to set goals... And achieving the goal is also not a big deal. But the struggle to achieve that goal... The struggle was great... He made a lot of struggles like that. Is he that great? What is he doing? It would only be a big story if I told you. But if you hear it from the mouth of a former co-worker, You will understand the life of a police officer. After understanding the life of a police officer, You are free to decide whether you want to join forces or not. Okay, dad. What must I do to find out more about myself? His first post as SI was in Muthiahpuram in Toothukkudi district. You go to Muthiahpuram. You will find a policeman named Simhachalam there. How much? Sir. Sir. Sir. Excuse me sir. Hello, sir. I need to meet Mr Simhachalam. I am Simhachalam. What do you want from me? Sir, I am from Chennai. My name is Iqbal, son of retired head constable Naseeruddin. My master notified me of your arrival. What do you want? Years ago, you worked with one inspector named Ramaraju. -Do you remember him? -How can I forget him? He used his gun on his first day on the job. Hey, shall we play hide and seek. [all kids] Yes, let's play OK wait! If everyone wants to play as a thief then who will be the police? I won't play the cop. You have to be a cop. Why should I play cop? Look at your stomach... Only cops have stomachs like yours. Who wears shabby clothes? People who wear hats and do nothing like you. All right, go and hide, all of you [all] Each person! Go and hide. Run fast. Here. [kid counting numbers] The police is coming. Out! Out! Out! Sir! Good morning sir. Where's the CI? He's there, sir. Ramaraju reporting, sir. Do you watch a lot of movies? You don't have to scream at the top of your lungs, just salute. Idiot! Is this your first posting? Go there and complete the formalities. Mr Writer? -Take care of him. -Yes sir. Now I have to deal with the robbers early in the morning. Hey, you. Come on stand in line. We got information that robbers who plundered the temple... hiding near the old bungalow. -You three, come with me. -Yes sir. -Will you come with me too? -Yes, Sir Do you know how to use a gun? I'm a gold medallist in shooting, sir. You are clearly overqualified. We will not participate in the Olympics but only chasing robbers. Hold this. But don't use them. [siren wailing] -Sir, I have a doubt. -What's that? Sir, why did we turn on the siren while we travel on duty? The people on the street are immune to the horns, that's why we use sirens to clear our way. But wouldn't that alert the muggers too, sir? Our policy is to let a hundred thieves escape, but no one who is innocent should be punished. Sir, I asked something and You answered something else. Your answer doesn't make sense, sir. Then ask relevant questions with the answer I gave. Don't ask stupid questions like why we use sirens or silencers. Ponder your brain on how to catch a thief, and then you might as well get a gold medal, just like him. Sir, to be honest, our sirens work very well. How? See, the thieves are on the run because of it. Yes, they really did run away. Stop the vehicle. stop it. Chase them. Run! "One plus one is two, cops and thieves are friends too" "One plus one is two" Money from the temple collection box transferred to our collection box, sir. -What do I do with these? -Store it safely. Hello, sir. -Hello, Mister Priest. -Sir. Check if everything is there. It is God's jewellery... This troublemaker seems to have promised Rs. 10,000... offering for Tirupati if the robbery goes their way plan. -Are they all there? -Everything is there, sir. But the money from the collection box? Don't we know about it? We also returned the money. But we need to find out whether the whole number comes from shrine collection box... or they stole it from another source or if it is money that you and the temple guardian has been sucked from the people. -Its a sin! -For now, carry this jewellery with you. God's property must remain confiscated for a long time. Take them away! I might as well forget the money. He seems to be a better actor than us. Here, the necklace. -See you soon, sir. -Don't look at me again. Everyone! Gather here. No one has the agility when chasing a thief, but everyone is high energy while sharing the change. This is for you. Did you not mention that you are in need of money, take this. Thank you sir. Take this. Hello Mister Olympics. You have hit the jackpot on your joining day itself. You are very lucky, bro. -Take this. -I don't want it, sir. You don't want it? I'm not giving you alms, this is a tribute for your hard work. Take. The government pays me for my hard work sir. OK, take this as a bonus. Have fun with this money. I haven't achieved anything yet great that I deserve to have fun. I'm just doing my job. If I take this money, I will do injustice for my duty. What are you talking about? Do you think that we are all corrupt officials... and you are the only honest person working in this country? Take. Stop showing off in front of me? -You have to do as the boss says. -Sir, please calm down. Please sit down, sir. He is new in this field, he will have a newfound energy. They will definitely behave like this. He'll be in a minute will mend his ways and be part of us, sir. Ask him to avoid the attitude and take this money. Sir, please take this. Don't argue any further. Just accept this. Take this. Go, sir. Please go. I'll talk to him, please continue your work. Please. Don't be angry, sir. He's a rookie. This is the problem with gold medallists. Don't be angry, sir. We must have seen so many freshers behave the same way. It's very common. Teach him how to behave with his seniors. Look at his attitude! "He moved, spitting out flames" "and tearing through the darkness." "This warrior roars and throws lightning" "and swirling all over the earth." "He doesn't need to use weapons of destruction," "the courage in his heart is his weapon." "Fight against crime." "When the coward roars" "Breaking the conventional system. Walks ahead like a lion" "Break the mountain of obstacles. Rewriting history." "Breaking the conventional system. Walks ahead like a lion." "Break the mountain of obstacles. Rewriting history." "Every breath turned into waves of great waves." "Exemplary courage and determination..." "struggling to achieve extraordinary goals." "The heart boils like lava and feet move by..." "from breaking up the battle formation." "You are Vishwanathan protector of this world." "If you jump into battle and challenge evil, victory is definitely yours." "You don't need to use weapons of destruction" "the courage in your heart is your weapon." "Fight against crime." "Let your courage roar." Hey, who are you? Are you a cop? I'm not afraid of the police. I will shoot you. "Break the mountain of obstacles. Rewriting history." Sir, Congratulations. You've proven that our department still has officers who can work efficiently. Do you know that you are very lucky? Why sir? An opportunity I didn't get up to 10 years of my working life, You've earned it within a year itself. -What chance is that, sir? -Encounter. Kill him on the way to court. There's a lot of pressure from high officials and ministers. Such evil people should not be imprisoned, they don't deserve to be in this world. Sir, should I finish him off? This overjoyed ness overwhelms us every moment. Did you catch him? The person who caught him should get the chance. You take care of court procedures. Yes sir. Kill him. Gold medallist and copper medallist, what a pair! And he called me too excited! Why did you change the route, sir? -Sir Simhachalam! -Sir? Are our weapons working properly? Have you ever used it? I never got a chance to use it sir. How do we know whether they work properly or not? Why don't you give it a try? You will find out their efficiency. Driver, stop the vehicle near tea shop on the right. Come down, let's have some tea. It looks like a fake shop, sir. I don't want tea, sir. Don't you want to drink tea when You see the tea shop? -I don't want sir. -Don't you like tea? Okay. What's your last wish? Sir? why are you asking my last request? What do you want to do, sir? Does not matter. Tell me. My last wish is to appear in the court sir. Very clever! That's why he was caught so easily. Hey, gold medallist! Aren't you? supposed to kill him on the way? Why did you bring him here? I have put on the uniform to work for law... not to work for one's wishes and crush. What are you doing? Why are you taking him to court? I didn't catch him on your order sir. that I will kill at your will. I do it according to the rules. What bloody rules? Didn't I order you? Nothing is given on paper, sir. I have no other choice but to take him to court. What do you want on paper? Should I now write a formal letter to you? Stay away from that attitude! You have to obey your boss, that's all! -Sir, please calm down. -Hey! Please sit down, sir. Please sir. He is a novice master. He has untapped energy. Lord Ramaraju, please go from here. Please go. Sir, you don't have to raise your temper. They live their luxurious world honesty and principle. Soon he will learn the ways of the world and join us. By the way, it's your fault, sir. I offered to kill him. But you didn't heed my words and argued that whoever catches gets a chance. Do not blame me. I'm already so annoyed. Sorry sir. Some time ago the Naxalites exploded at the police station, at which village? Satyamangala, sir. Who is SI there? Who will work at the station, sir? Whoever was stationed there, applied for leave and never showed up for the job. Nobody posted there. Move him! [mobile ringing] Where are you? I'm near the dome, sir. Look here... -Hello, sir. -Hello. You seem to be waiting for a long time Tell me what do you want? Sir, what happened after Mr. Ramaraju join Satyamangala station? Generally, a police officer takes costs only after joining the task. But Ramaraju took over first and join the task later. Who is journalist Shiva here? Look, there is a man blabbering there. Ask him. [indistinct talk] Shiva journalist? Shiva? I'm the only journalist you can be find all over this area. I'm journalist Shankar, how can I help you? Sorry. Hello, what do you want? I'm here for an important assignment. I don't think you are cut out for it. I'm the first to find out about trivia activity that occurs in this forest. Just say what you want. I'm from the BBC, I want an interview with the Naxalites in this area... and I've been told that journalist Shiva can take me to them. I've arranged everything but me cannot get that Shiva. Looks like he got some money. They must have mistaken Shankar as Shiva. you are looking for me. How do I believe you? I'll take you to the Naxalites, set you up interview and will get you back safely. We can talk about formality after we come back. Come. Come with me. Come! From here... This way or that way... This way... Not like that. Hope it's deep. Where is he? Why is he ahead of me? It's like I'm not helping him, it's like he's helping me. I have to catch up with him. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Had to go 5 rounds Come. -Lal Salaam, Shankar brother! -Lal Salaam! Where are you brother Shankar? Not much to see you around. Actually... Brother Shankar will not come to us when we need him. He comes to us only when he needs us. -That's not true, sir. -By the way, who is he? Brother... He is an acquaintance. His name is Raju. Raju? Which Raju? And the King of which country? Alluri Seetharama Raju, Sub-Inspector of police, Satyamangala police station. How dare you! You walk up to us area and accepted to be a police officer. After joining the Police department, one will automatically find yourself brave enough to face anything. What do you start with? Kill him. Before him, kill this bloody Shankar. I don't know anything. Please I'm here to talk to you. Can't you calmly answer my question? Ravi, stop. He said he wanted to talk. -Drop all your weapons. -OK. What do you want to talk about? The two of us are not that enemy we shoot at the sight of each other. I am not a police officer, nor are you a Naxal. Do you know the origin of the word 'Naxal'? Immediately after independence, some youths belonging to Naxalbhari in West Bengal... killed some police officers and ran into the forest. Since then, whoever killed a police officer and... fleeing into the forest they were called Naxalites. Are you all Naxalites? We are not Naxalites. We are the socialists fight for the welfare of society. Exactly my point! You are fighting for the general public and I serve the same public. When we both work towards the same goal, why do we have to kill each other? You are still not corrupted by the police force. You speak with only half knowledge. Anyone who has seen atrocities by the police would react the same way. You still don't notice your department atrocities. We are told the same in our training, sir... that you are still unaware of the cruelty of the Naxals. Here you are feeding them the same information. Hatred frustrates ambition. We are used to listening to the so-called rumours... but haven't spoken to each other openly. That's why I decided to meet you in person. Let's work together. We have been fooled many times by sweet talk like your department. How do you expect us to trust you again? I don't want to drag this matter. I'll keep my question very simple. Tell me what I have to do to make you believe me. I will do it. Only then will I ask you to do anything. There are many tribes around this forest. No job opportunities for anyone. Give them job opportunities show them the path they will walk have a stable income... After that, I will trust you. I will. I will do anything to make us all happy. I will see you again once you believe in me "Breaking the conventional system. Walks ahead like a lion" "Break the mountain of obstacles. Rewriting history." "I told them to take care of it. Don't worry." Why did the officer visit me? What's the news? Your name is the first name on the Naxalite hit list, sir. What's that? What should I do now? Congratulations sir. I don't know if you've ever been first in school... but it looks like you're first on the hit list. Stupid people. I'm moving to Andaman, officer. Until your name is on the hit list, it won't be a problem if you are in Andaman or USA. What should I do now? I have a plan to deal with this situation. "You are a warrior and if you let your hope brave horse ride," "the edge of the universe will be the end." Sit down. "take the form of a weapon and consciousness will flow." "Grass that grows with a touch warm sunshine, you make it your bow." "You will not abdicate this responsibility that you are burdened." "You don't need to use weapons of destruction," "the courage in your heart is your weapon." "Fight against crime." "Let your courage roar." "Breaking the conventional system. Walks ahead like a lion." "Break the mountain of obstacles. Rewriting history." -Hello, sir. -Hello! Please sit. The Naxals are monitoring your activity. They want to meet you sir. Let's meet then. When do we meet sir? If Naxal wants to meet me, they can come directly to me. Ask them to come. Let's go. Why Naxal left the forest and enter the village? Something is happening. Come on and see Ramaraju! Come out. Because you did what we asked, we came here to surrender. I appreciate your visit, but when have I ever asked you to turn yourself in? Who's he? Who's he? Who are you talking about, sir? Ramaraju? Yes. Do we punish him or send him on vacation? What's he doing, sir? What else to do? Police officer and Naxal together build a new police station. Greetings, father. Father, Ramaraju's story is very interesting. I want to learn more about his personal life. Mother? Father? Is he already married? Does he have children? As far as I know, after 6 to 7 transfers, he was promoted to Circle Inspector. He got married as soon as he got the promotion. He took over duties as Circle Inspector at the beach road Toothukkudi police station. Sir. Sir. -Welcome sir. -Thank You. -This is your cabin, sir. -Okay. Sir, this is the cell phone given to you by department. Sir, I didn't buy it. This is a gift from my son, who live in the US. Which phone is this? Blackberry, sir. It has not launched in India yet sir. There are many features in it, sir. -Like what? -It's like a mini-sized computer, sir. You can send email or MMS as well. Home Minister is calling. That's my wife, sir. Oh, pick up. Sir? It's okay, you can talk. -Hello.-Where are you? -In the Station.-When will you return home? After the task, I have a small job, post that I will come home. Don't you dare wander around the city. Go straight home after work. If I find you going to someone else's house, I will break your bones. Do you understand? Don't just make noise, tell me out loud and it is clear that you got it. I understand. I need to get rid of this phone as soon as possible, sir. -What happened? -What else must happen, sir? People could clearly hear all the scolding that my wife gave to me on call. But doesn't it have a lot of features? My own future is bleak, who cares about this feature sir? Hello. Ragging is going on in medical college. Please come immediately, ma'am. -OK, will come. -Even now, you are acting smart. What happened? Why cover yourself from head to toe, our college does not have AC. Let your skin breathe easy. So many reactions for this small act? You have migrated to the city for your higher education, now get rid of this ancient scarf. Get rid of them. Why did you leave them? Are they your sisters? If we don't remove your scarf after picking up them off, it would be disrespectful to your beauty. Why are you stopping? Continue with what are you doing. Why are you getting scared? Do you feel brave after I'm here? Today, I am available at the police station. An unknown person named station and I can come here. Since, after all, I'm here, I'll give them a thrashing. But you will come to the same college again... and they will come to the same college again. The same thing will repeat. This time, I may not be present at the station. What are you going to do next? We must save ourselves from any adverse situation. In our mythology, even Goddesses have slaying demons along with the Gods. You are empowered with the power of that Goddess. You are equipped with weapons as well. Take off your bracelet and hold it against your knuckles. Take off your sandals. Hold the hairpin as a weapon. What did you feel when they tore you to pieces? We feel like hitting them, sir. We feel like thrashing them, sir. We feel like killing them, sir. Hit them if you want, beat them if you want and kill them if you want. We will kill you if you trouble us again. Will you do it again? Did you watch the show? Ask them to stop beating them. Do you know who I am? I am MP Sambasiva Rao's son. Ask them to stop beating them. How are you, dad? I'm fine as usual. I'm a military man, here body is made of steel. -A retired military. -Shut up. Asking, wait. When asked about marriage last time, you said you want to wait till become Inspector. You are now an Inspector. I don't want to hear any more excuses from you. -You must marry. -Yes. Okay. How is Chennai? How is our neighbour, Mr Ramesh? Don't try to change the subject. Talk about marriage. They seemed to be really adamant this time. OK, find a girl. I will definitely marry if I like her. We already have a potential partner for you. He's also from Toothukkudi. That's why we're here. We really like that girl. If you even see her you will like her for sure. First marriage and then soon children. The house will soon be filled with frolicking children. Hi. Been waiting a long time? Oh! So you are stupid huh? Then why don't you want to talk? Hi. Oh! Are you afraid of me or are you hesitant to open up? In fact, I haven't spoken to a police before. I'm not a cop now. I'm just another man here to find a bride. After all, aren't the police and society friends? You may find that quote all over the place but that is not true in the field. That's a punch! You don't hesitate to sneak it sneaky comments on the other side though. Do you watch movies? No. I watch a lot. Sports, embroidery or other extracurricular activities? You don't know, do you? Can you at least cook? No. So you can't eat either. No, no. I eat well. You eat? Very good. Me, too. In hotels, restaurants and everywhere you can always find me eating. So, finally, there is one thing in common between us. Sir, your juice is ready. Please stay here. I'll get it for you. Hi! That's Ramaraju sir! -Let's go see him. -Let's go. -Hello, sir. -Hi. Since the day you saved us, there has been no incidents of bullying on campus, sir. Good. I went crazy after seeing you in uniform, now that I see you in casual clothes, I believe it that madness will last for a long time. Sir, I heard that you are single. Because he's smiling, it means he's smiling. If I smile a little harder, I will probably stay single forever. Sir, do you know? My father has four flats in Toothukkudi. If you marry me, You may have it all. Sir, don't believe her. I am from Pollachi, we have 10 acres of land with coconut plantations and another 20 acres of land. If you marry me, you may have it all. If you find it difficult to choose between us, you may marry the four of us. -Yes, of course. -We have no problem. Sorry, girls. She is my fiance. -Hi. -Hi, madam. You are very lucky. [all] Yes, Sir. Ma'am is very lucky. Okay. Bye sir. Goodbye. -Who are they? -Medical college girls. They said they liked me more in this regard dressed rather than in uniform. Do you think that's right? "Lord Narayana became the groom" "Goddess Mahalakshmi became the bride" "The wedding stage is like Vaikuntha abode" "Cupid like tangles their hearts together" "The sky rained sacred rice, the wind showered the flowers on it" "Oceans become clouds to be a part of this" "And with fire as a witness Lord Dharani blesses them" The moment you saw me... Noise of my heart became music. "For your gaze, my heart flutters..." "and responds like music!" "You've called me like a cuckoo" "Every cell in my body echoes notes like a flute" "Oh Love, if you are the melody, I will be the rhythm" "My dear, our life will be meaningful only if we unite" "Oh Love, if you are the melody, I will be the rhythm" "My dear, our life will be meaningful only if we unite" "If you are the sound and I am the flute" "This union will be as soothing as melodies from Lord Krishna's flute" "If you're a Veena and I'm the strings" "This is the sweet feast of Veena's orchestra" "By flicking your hips, you make my heart flutter" "The union of our two lips will give causing lots of melodious screams" "Oh Love, if you are the melody, I will be the rhythm" "My dear, our life will have meaning only when we are united" "Oh Love, if you are the melody, I will be the rhythm" "My dear, our life will have meaning only when we are united" "You are full of life and I am full of youth" "This union will flow the sweetness of love" "You are the notes and I am the vocals" "Together the melodies will be the most fun" "The sweet scent of lotus flower nectar. This moment is a dream come true" "And heart sways to raga and crave pampering newfound love forever" "Oh Love, if you are the melody, I will be the rhythm" "My dear, our life will have meaning only when we are united" "Oh Love, if you are the melody, I will be the rhythm" "My dear, our life will have meaning only when we are united" [indistinct chatter] By the way, who is Kali? [man groaning in pain] He's a notorious rowdy in this area, sir. He is known as the right hand of MP Sambasiva Rao. He manages all the MP's illegal activities. -Stop. What happened? -I don't know, sir. -Hey, you. What's going on here? -I don't know, sir. It happened right in front of your store. Don't you see anything? I'm busy with my work, I don't see anything, sir. Has no one seen what happened here? Not even one person? If anyone has any information, please let us know. Sir. He is Kali, sir. I heard about you. I also heard a lot about you. What do they call you? Yes, it seems you are very sincere. You just heard about me but never see me in action, right? I'll show you. You've seen it. By now you must have understood situation here. People are spoiled because excessive consumption of films. Sir, to show police officers as heroes, film makers portray people like us as villains. But in reality, that's not true. Yes. You don't deserve that title. This is reality and does not exist criminals in real life. But they have heroes, that's the Police! If anyone dares to drag him to my jeep, I will offer all the money in this wallet to them. Can anyone come forward? Isn't there anyone who dares? You should learn from the girls in your town, they ripped the guys who tried to harm them. Doesn't anyone dare? How dare you! Only 100? I will buy this bracelet from Rs. 100 and distribute it to all these people. What's this? Why did you bring Mr. Kali here? He's not Mr. Kali, Sir. Just one time. Moreover, I have not caught it yet. I've bought him here to investigate a murder that took place in the market. There is a protocol that must be followed an interrogation. Don't you know that? Sorry, Mr Kali. You may go. If there are any formalities left, our friends will come to you to solve it. First you go and meet the MP sir. Hello! I'm talking to you King Genghis Khan, my favourite king. He once said that if you do good to others, they will remember you for a short time... but if you hurt them, they won't forget you for a long time. We are politicians... we want people not to forget us for a long time. That's why we are like this! We will never change. But the government changes every 5 years, You are part of that government. Won't you change then? You will. If you insist on not changing then we have to forcefully change you. It's not us who need to fix our ways. That is you! Your entire department works for my government. Why don't you work for me? It will be good for both of us. I don't care about our welfare, I crave the welfare of society. Public? Should I tell you an interesting fact about society? Everyone in our country is subject to Mahatma Gandhi all day. Do you know why? Because every note circulating in this country, there is a photo... if i have this, they will bow down to me and if you possess this, they will bow down to you. I didn't do my job to receive recognition or praise from people, I do this to save society from society's evils. I not only know how to commit crimes... but also I am also a master in escaping of the law for the crime. Watch out, all the crooks in this state! I'm even ready to die. Because God has assigned you punishment for your crimes in my form. This statement is also from your Genghis Khan. Did you see his attitude, sir? That's why I told you to kill him the day he laid down his hand to me. -But you don't listen to me. -Hey! If you kill a cop, the whole department will be against us. That's why we can't kill them.

Thank You Why did you come to Vizag all suddenly, sir? I'm coming for you. I want to talk to you about you. I liked you when you asked to meet someone but you refuse doing so on that grounds would be against the law. But now you have stood against injustice by breaking the law. But I don't like you. Because in the first case, I see your thought process but in the second case, nothing but anger. You have taken this matter very personally. I don't take it personally, sir. You may have justification. But that justification can help you justify your actions on yourself but it will be of no use to me. Sit down. Weren't you the one who told me the policeman? not people but systems? So when you're in the system, nothing should be personal for you. But, all your actions are good or bad, Moral or immoral will be reflected in the organization. Proud to be a Police the officer is the Ram within you and vanity becomes the police officer is the Ravan in you. Your duty is to protect the people but not to punish criminals. Look, Ramraj. Everyone wants to beat Ravan within him to lead a life like Ram but only a police officer is obliged to kill Ravan is inside him and working like Ram. If you believe that you are capable of killing the Ravan in you and you can live a life like a Ram, come to Hyderabad and meet me. I need your help in Hyderabad. I need you there but I only need the good part of you without the devil inside you. There is a problem in Hyderabad. The problem name is Mir Ali Bagh. The people from that place have no faith in the Police department. If they encounter a problem, they approach their local leader but will not approach the police station. In addition, society consists of many poor and uneducated people. This makes the terrorist's job much easier. We have information that the terrorists are plan their operations from this place. But since the locals don't support the police, we are helpless. Despite being in Hyderabad we relied on national agencies for information. I hope you can bring some change in that area. I have a plan, sir. I've chosen 20 paths around Mir Ali Bagh Station I have allocated each of you a path. Your task is to come to the station every day, sign your presence and get back on your way. Stay on that path, talk to people around and attend to their needs. It is not right for us to ignore them just because they ignore us. It is our duty to protect them Everyone gathered at the station again at 7pm and report what you saw that day. This is your duty from tomorrow onwards. SI Harsha will tell you which path has has been allocated to each of you. You may go. - Let's go. Sir, if I keep doing this work, I will get nothing money besides my salary.

What are you talking about, sir? Why did you ask him to take part in the robbery? Taking bribes while in uniform is is the same as being part of a robbery. Why should we shame uniforms? for our personal needs? If he wants to do the task sincerely then ask for it he will come to the station tomorrow in his uniform if not, ask him to submit resignation letter. Sir? Whatever the decision, it must be yours. His life depends on your decisions. Be careful. Few and stay that way. Take this. Keep it in the kitchen. Come come. How are you? Who was assigned to this path? You did a good job, brother.

Happy birthday! It's not my birthday, it's yours! What's that? You don't care about my birthday, I think you will be at home for your birthday at least. That's why I called everyone to the party and everyone waiting for you for a long time but you didn't show up. Your friends just left disappointed. My friends? Are you worried about them?

Yes sir. Let's go. This is Sir I heard that your daughter has gone missing. We're not complaining. Why are you worried? We can take care of our problems, You don't have to meddle in it. By the way, I know very well about your department. You approach us only when you need us but when we need help the most You won't care about us. You may go. Many people share the same belief about the police department. In fact, I also once scolded the police in my childhood because I think they can do a lot of things with the kind of power they have but they don't. Then my father told me something. If you know what the police can do and how to do it, then why do you criticize them? Why don't you become a cop? officer and run the talk? By doing so, you will display police force not only for ordinary citizens but for the whole department. Those words inspired me to become a cop. My task is to eradicate the negative opinion you have about me. Trust me for once and register a case. I take responsibility to get your daughter back. Sir, this is the call list you requested. There have been several calls to this number. Whose number is it? A local leader, Mr. Call him in. - Yes sir. Farah is a good girl. Very active. I met him recently. Why did you meet him?

Doesn't he live on the 13th floor? Show me the floor tape. There are no CC cameras on that floor, sir. They were removed due to complaints from one of the guests.

Press the 13th floor button. See… it takes 12 seconds to go up to the 12th floor but it took 14 seconds to go up to the 13th floor. It means, it takes one second to climb each floor but it takes two seconds to climb between the 12th and 13th floor. Why is there a time difference, sir? Because there is a floor in between the 12th and 13th. Sir, this way See Harsha. Farah descended on the 13th floor when he came here for the first time.

We approach poor Muslim families and bid that Dubai Sheikh want to marry your daughter and in return, he will offer you 2 lakhs. We persuaded them by saying that their daughter will live a comfortable life in Dubai and they agreed. We present all such girls to the Shaykh, she married the person she liked and took him to the Gulf with him. The sheikh used the girl up their pleasure is satisfied and after that, they made him their slave. How does Farah relate to this? Most of his friends moved to Bay after marriage but not back He became suspicious when he couldn't reach them even on call and he came looking for me. Finally, he began to follow all girl and collect all the data about how many girls are trafficked from here and the place where they are sent. We have no other choice but to kidnap him. What did you do to him? Tell me. We killed him two days ago. Kill him? Excuse me sir. I can't keep my promise. I have faith when I promise you that I will get your daughter back.

We caught the sniper who attacked you. Where is he, sir? Lal Greetings Shankar! Sir, he is Ravi, right? Yes! But didn't I help their group? They should be thanking me, right? He feels that you are the reason their battalion was weakened. So? He believed that their battalion weakened because of you and you are the cause of the death of many of them Naxals in the war between Police and Naxals in Chattisgarh. He attacked you to take revenge. What is this, sir? This is the work of the Police, Ramaraju. We shouldn't take any matter personally. But the opposite side will take everything in private.

Love is eternal and forgotten is nothing in love. Love is eternal with so much glory, greater than the supreme power Love is eternal and forgotten is nothing in love. Love is eternal with so much glory, greater than the supreme power That is why every step of love is like a test and before you understand true love everything will end and this is life! Thats it! The pain and suffering hurt me from the inside. With the loss of life, disaster erupted. The pain and suffering hurt me from the inside. With the loss of life, disaster erupted. Drops separated from clouds and fell on the earth giving birth to a thousand lives like you have bought a smile for a thousand faces. Do you forget the relationship like a flowing river? You grow so tall with sacrifice that you have made. We meet you on the battlefield and You remain in our memory like a miracle. Time that keeps moving spins a web of tragedy which leaves nothing but emptiness and darkness. The pain and suffering hurt me from the inside. With the loss of life, disaster erupted. Sir, what happened? Hardcore terrorists have taken over this school and hostage the teachers and students. The school is under our control. All students and staff are safe with us. You caught some of us organization in Meer Ali Bagh. We need negotiators to talk it through. We give you one hour. if you won't arrange a negotiator within this time or if you try to act too smart, we will kill all these kids. Sir, the head of the anti-terrorist squad is here. Hello! - Hello! - Please come! How many terrorists are inside? They are probably around 10 to 15. Do they have guns? As per our information, some are holding AK 47 and some wielded local weapons. So, recruit locally then. So, So, recruit locally then. Are you jamming the signal? We jammed everything, sir. There's no room for anything communication occurs. Sir, they are very well prepared. Their request to send a negotiator within the allotted time show that they very clearly. The reason they chose this school was children of many politicians and celebrities study in this school. So, there's going to be a lot of pressure and we will not risk their lives. It will take 45 minutes at that point CRPF and ATS people down. They said not to talk to anyone until then. Give me one chance, sir. I will attack. What? How can you attack? We must attack, sir. This is called the element of surprise. Sir, that's how we are taught in our training, right? We should attack them when they least expect us. Now the situation is completely in their control and they will happily roam around in a relaxed state. We have to finish the job in the next 40 minutes before CRPF, media, or negotiators get here. Only then can we take the situation into our control. Hey, you're a cop. This is a task that an ATS commando force has to perform. What experience do you have for attacking? Sir, you didn't lock up Maoists, terrorists, and the mafia separately. They're all the same as far as I know, anti-social elements. It's not right to say that we shouldn't attack them because they are terrorists, sir. We are also trained. So we attacked them Commissioner, who is he? Just ask him to leave here. How many police officers do you need? Four, sir! Choose what you want from the clerk there. Thank you sir! Are you crazy? You are risking everything. It's not just your job, you're even risking children's lives in it. Even my daughter is in between children inside, sir. There are 400 children in it. We don't know how many terrorists there are. They are animals. I need four hunters to hunt down the beast. This operation may succeed or fail. We may come back alive or dead. Whatever the result, this operation must be remembered forever. When these children were asked about their ambitions, become a Doctor, Engineer, or Scientist. But after this operation, at least 40 of these kids have to say that "I want to be a Police". Who wants to join this operation with me, take a step forward. Thank you so much for trusting me. But we're going to do a sting operation and we don't need 20 people for that, just four. I will give some conditions. Those who fulfill it, please take a step back. Condition number one those with kids in you take one step back. Those who are married within you, take a step back. If you are the only one for your parents, one step backward. OK, guys. Let's get ready, come on. Sir, I need to tell you something. Three of the officers you just selected meet the requirements you need. Ask them to come. - Yes sir! You're crazy? I say those who meet the requirements have to back off, right? Hey Harsha, you are the only child from your parents, right? Yes, Sir. I'm the only boy. You know why, sir? I have a younger brother. But he died in Gokul chatter blast sir. There are four hundred people like me brother there, sir. This time, I didn't lose any of them. Amar, aren't you married? Yes, Sir. I just got married. Do you know why my wife married me sir? It's because I'm a cop. He believed that I would do something for this nation and that's why she married me, sir. If I keep stepping back any time I see danger coming my way, how will she love me sir? I didn't take a step back to guard for your trust, sir. Mom, you have children, right? Yes, Sir. I have twins. You just said that at least 40 kids should think about being The police after seeing this operation we did. But I think it should be 42 children, sir. Obviously, sir! Sir, there are 12 in total. Sir, two guard main block and one guarding the secondary block. Some of them look after the children while keeping them in herds and one person holds Headmaster at gunpoint while observing all this. OK, guys. There are three important things. One, When we aim target not to be missed. When we shoot it has to kill. And number two, ae should avoid CC cameras at all costs. And number three, as far as possible, avoid shooting in front of the kids. Let's go. Hey, why are you crying? Shut up All children are safe, sir. Only the Principal remained. Yes, Sir. Even the entire staff is safe. Welcome Ramaraja, the silence aroused suspicion in me. None of my people move well. I know that you are inside as you are not visible on the outside. Do you think all children are safe? The Commissioner's daughter is with me. He's so cute. Yes, Sir. He studied here. I'm waiting for you in the conference room. Come fast. Even the media is here. If you don't come here, I will shoot in front of the media. No need to take this risk, sir. Let's get all the kids out. This operation fails even if one child dies. I will take care of him. The sound of this gun is your signal. Take all the kids out once you hear this. Yes sir! Move! Come on, move quickly. We have the latest news, we find out that the Police have form a team and attack the terrorists. We were told that the operation was a success. Information is that all children and staff are safe. We can see the Police guarding it carefully all the kids get out of the building. Even the kids are out and about we clearly see the visual. Unfortunately, a senior Police officer is known to have died in this operation. Her name is Alluri Sita Ramaraju and he has led this operation. You say Mr. Ramaraju died, but how? What happened in the Principal's office, sir? I arranged a few mourning meetings days after Ramaraju's death. Ramaraju would always say that, Police is not people, but systems. But today the whole system is feeling proud of that one person. Ramaraju shows us how it goes when a member of the Police seriously carry out their duties. Likewise, when everyone does his duty sincerely, they can achieve something beyond their imagination. One minute, sir. - Yes! Play this CD once. You... bastard. Ramaraja you do not know me but i know who you are. I'm Ali. You previously ruined my grand plan bomb blast by catching all my friends. I will free them all and do the same explosion. I will give my life for the holy war. Scream the bastards, scream! Hi, this is your only chance. Kill me immediately. If I get out alive... not only you... I will erase the word holy war from this country. All right, Rascal. I will kill you immediately. I want to witness your courage, let me hear that word once from your mouth. Come on, say Jihad. Say Holy war once. Let's say Holy war. Come on, say holy war. Look at this. Take off your pants. Cut. Let's say Holy war. Say... Say. Say Jihad Say! Say! Say holy war now, Say holy war now, Say it now. Ji… Ji… Ji… Jai Hind! I can't see it anyway. At least show me the picture, sir.
