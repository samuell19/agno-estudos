I've never really worked in a real restaurant before. - I don't... - You don't have experience. Tell me, honey, what does your father think about you working in a tavern? Actually, they're both pretty angry at me right now. - Because of school? - Yeah. Nah. I bet they're just worried about you. There's lots to be worried about in the world these days. They just wish I'd finish the semester. But the people up there... I don't know. It's not like I'm never gonna take any classes. I'm thinking I might take a photography course at community... if the hours didn't, um... - Conflict. - Yeah. - I might take up accounting for my dad. - Accounting could be useful. Especially around here. - Yeah, definitely. - Callie... not everybody's supposed to go to college. Somebody's gotta roll up their sleeves and do the work. - Yep. - All right. So when do you want to start? Goddamn it! Typical. So, honey, when do you want to start? What do you say tonight? Hmm? Yeah, sure. I mean, you don't have to do this, you know? I mean, if you can use me, I'm a very committed person. - But Syracuse was a whole different... - Harry? Thing. - Oh, here's your check. - Thanks, Doll. Oh, watch your step. Victor? That's my son.

That causes nothing but trouble because my wife says he can stay for free. Lost eight pounds on that stuff. I had this dream, and it's been bothering me... or on my mind for about a week now. Nanny. Here, honey. There was this individual telling me... that I was going to be getting married... and I would be getting married to a pilot... towards the end of August. - Are you dating anybody? - All right.

A big white... a white Borden's truck. And the next thing I know is... smash! Some trucker smashed his rig... right into the Borden's... and stopped it... stopped it five feet from me. And through the smoke and the steam and everything... walks Burt Lancaster. Really? I just saw him in a movie. It was really Pete, but I swear to God, he looked... just like Burt Lancaster. And he leaned over and said, "Hey, kiddo. You okay?" And I said, "Sure." You didn't know this guy or anything? He just kind of appeared? No, not yet. Pete was... a trucker, an interstate trucker. He was just passing through. Anyway, the point is... he put his... whole livelihood in jeopardy to save me. It was his truck. He owned it. He did that to save me... a stranger, out of the goodness... of his heart. Good hearts are good things. - That's right, Leo. - And hard to find. And that too. Can I... Whoa. Take this, please. It's getting all lopsided. I'm sorry. - That's amazing. Wow. - Not really. Yes, it is. What are you talking about? You're really good at this. - I hate making pizza. - No way. But he loves making breakfast. This young man takes very good care of his mother. He makes me a whole buffet... every single morning. What's the name of that school, that cooking schooI... the really fancy one across the river? I think you should go there. I think that you could become a great chef. He already is. Well, of course he is. I didn't mean to say that... Callie, they would just charge us a lot of money... to teach him what he already knows. I don't think so. Forgot to slice it, chef. Cursing is not going to make your argument any more persuasive. Bullshit! There comes a time, miss, when you better think about your future. And what is the future? Her? How long do you think she's gonna hang around this bone orchard? - That's completely up to my son Victor. - Bullshit! All right, I don't want any more of this tonight. You have a bad mouth. You have a bad reputation. It gets you in trouble with people... and I do not want to have it anymore! Somebody writes something on the bathroom mirror. Who knows who did it? I don't want to talk about this anymore. Well, I want to set this straight. Somebody writes something on the mirror, it could be about you. Yes, I'm sure.

No comments, please. And, uh, it had... This card had a little guy with a potbelly... and it looked like he was in bed sick, but when you open up the card... he was actually in bed with a whole bunch of well-endowed women. - Lucky guy. - That's what I thought. Anyway, uh... What did it say? Shit. I don't know. I forgot, but it was funny. I mean, these cards are... They're sweet and everything, but funny cards, you know... they cheer you up. Hello? Sweetheart, do me a favor. I need my nail kit. It's under the sink in the bathroom. I'll bring it tomorrow. I guess it's pretty late. It's very quiet here too. Are you all right? I love your show, and I listen to it faithfully. Good woman. Then I won't give you the pop quiz... that I was thinking about. My problem today is that I have a problem with my sister-in-law. We were friends before we were sisters-in-law. And we were at a family gathering. They arrived there, and she didn't speak to me. I speak to her daily. We talk... Victor, remember... Remember the time we left you alone? It was the first time. It was the Fourth of July, Sunday. And you... filled all the Baggies with colored water. How old were you? Nine? Ten? Your father threw a fit. When your father went... But then in a little while... you began to grow. And it was almost... like I had him back again. The security guard... We were goin' down to the ward, right? This little arm just comes right out, and you hear her screamin' and yellin'. You should have seen the look on his face. - On the third floor. - Good. They booked the whole wing, for the police entourage or whatever. Witness protection. They should make assholes like that stand trial, as is. Dr. Rydell, call the operator. Hello? Take whatever you want. She don't care. Dr. Ofey, call the operator. Buns are right under the counter. You want me to get you one? Hello? You a fan, or you just bought the jacket? Fan. Bet you're a Thurman Munson man. '79! Am I right? Me too. Hey, bud, look. She don't care. Just take one. Go on. Pretend you're in heaven. Anything you want. Go on! That's it. Dr. Hill, 295. Yeah. Big as an ox, but nobody sees you. I got the same thing. Only I ain't big. I just talk loud, and no one hears me. Then somethin' funny happens. I start whispering. Suddenly, everyone hears me. You're not sick, are you? Your mother? That's tough. That's the toughest one. Except if you lose a kid. Watching a kid die... that is it. That's the toughest one. Are you sick? Well, they say I'm gettin' better... but I don't buy the green bananas anymore. They just want me outta here. Munson, he's our type. Didn't need a plane crash to get my attention. That's what he did though, you know? He crashed that plane right on purpose... 'cause he got sick of it. Losin' all the lime's light to Reggie. Reggie! Now Reggie gets fat. Thurman, he's the goddamn patron saint of baseball. What seems to be the matter? He's been having left lower quadrant pain and vomiting. I think we better get him to emergency... I'm gonna need a decaf. Check on those two... Hey. Okay. What the hell's a kilo? Anybody know? How's Dolly? Fine. Can you be a little more specific? They took that... the thing out of her neck. And that's the end of it? They got everything? Whatever? WelI... they're runnin' tests. I'm gonna need a lift tonight. My car's dead. Hello? Hi. It's 94 even. How's Dolly? She's fine. I thought only pizzas came through the slot. Oh, sorry. Let me get that out of your way. Can you keep this back here for me, please? Sure. You know, I have something... Make a right. Turn right. Relax, Victor. It's great, huh? What's that? Can I have one? Thanks. Saving yourself for someone special? Hello? Just don't put in anything for now. I am going through a tough time in my marriage. My wife is leaving me... and... this is kind of out of the blue. No, it's not. You may not have been paying attention... but very few people, unless they're psychotic... just sort of say, "Yesterday I was happy. Today, I'm outta here." Since they've been known as the world's most prestigious culinary college... there are 2,000 students on campus now... as compared to the 50 that started when the Institute was founded. We'll now head into our baking and pastry building. For those of you dining tonight in the Bounty, note the flags above you. Those are from the wine-producing states throughout the country. Tonight you'll be dining exclusively on American regional cuisine... and you'll be drinking American wines. Now let me show you one of our bakeshops... where our baking and pastry students are at work... putting the final details on what looks like some wedding cakes... and some breads and some different pastries. You'll notice the chef supervising them. He has the green and gold around his collar. All of these desserts will be sent to our restaurants... where they will be served for lunch and dinner. Now, we have four different restaurants. You know about the American Bounty. We also have Saint Andrew's Cafe and our Nutrition Center... which opened in 1989 as a way to help the public... have nutritional meals, since that's what they're asking for. We also have a French restaurant... Jeff, no. Because I can't just quit on her. She's in the hospital. That's 'cause that's what I promised. Yes, because that's what I promised. Jeff, please. I really can't deal with all this right now. Please don't do this. I'm gonna freak out. I told her she was gonna drop 'em. Told her to make two trips. Jeff, no. Because I can't just quit. It's not possible. Hey Vic. Why did you come here? I told you I can't talk now. Why are you here? This fuckin' place is empty, Callie. Why can't we talk? Because we can't. I'm working. What is goin' on? I want to know. Nothing's going on. Please, I can't talk now. - All right, whatever. - Jeff, I... - Lovers' spat? - Fuck you. Excuse me? Fuck you! - You little cock-tease. - Get out of my way! - And you have a big mouth. - I do then, don't I? - I guess you do. - Come on, girls. You better stay in there for a while. Don't say anything to her. She's not ready for this world, huh? Ma and Pa must treat her like a goddamn little princess. Whoa. Can't you be nicer... to her? Nice? Did you hear what she said to me? You don't have to be nice, just be nicer. Or what? What? Or what, Victor? Or I'll fire you. Last I heard, your mother still ran this place! Hi, I'm late. Yeah, it's Callie. Listen, I'm here at the tavern and... I got into a really big fight with Jeff earlier today... and he's not showing up to pick me up. Here he comes. I'll take care of this. Maybe you could get the car and come pick me up. Don't you think... I don't know. I... Somebody ought to talk to that girl. Del don't need that shit. She said some pretty nasty things, Vic. Somebody ought to straighten that girl out, huh? What does he do? He goes to Del. She's innocent, for Chrissake. Workin' this crummy joint for fifteen years! Innocent as driven snow! And he tells her... Oh, you didn't? You didn't? Well, I'm glad you didn't. Because then I would have to fuck you up, Vic. Delores is a very fine lady friend of mine, Vic. And I don't think that's the way to treat her. I... Don't you walk away. I'm talkin' to you. Just because your mommy's sick, it doesn't mean you can shit on people... you fat fuck. Can you give me a ride home? Southern Comfort. Do you want some? So did you go to the hospital today? Well, do you think you might go to the hospital tomorrow? Maybe. Very early. Well, can I go with you? Please, Victor? I really need to talk to Dolly. A lot of things have been happening lately. Why'd you stop? Holy shit! Shit! Oh, my God, that's amazing. Wow. Thanks. Wow. You know, you're a really cool person, Victor. Cooler than someone would think. And there's more of you to love, right? It's okay. What am I doing with my life, Victor? I don't know anything anymore. I think we should go now. - Good morning. - Good morning. I'm sorry. You said early. Do you want me to come back in an hour or something? I got your mom some chocolates. I thought she'd like that. Do you think she'll like these? Open 'em. Where'd you get that? Cleaning up behind the booth. I thought I'd show it to Ma. Homosexuality, we say it's okay. These are things God has said are wrong, and if our society... Do you mind if I change this?

Well, someone's gotta tell Delores. What is this, some insurance thing? What are you two talkin' about? Nothin', Del. Man talk.

Jeff, maybe we should call the police or something. Are you okay? - She's quitting. She wants her pay. - Jeff, please. She's had to deal with all this bullshit, and she's had enough. Why don't you just go outside, okay? I'm really sorry about your mother. And I didn't mean to get so angry. It was really, really nice... for you guys to hire me and everything, but... I just feel like... you don't really need the help. You're a really wonderful person, Victor. I have to go now. Maybe... you could come by sometime to visit. You know, once in a while. Yeah, sure. I mean... I might be going back to school for a while. Bye. Good-bye. You okay? Goddamn it! Oh, my God, did I knock all those off? No, just one. Sorry. Let me just... You know, I do that sometimes.
