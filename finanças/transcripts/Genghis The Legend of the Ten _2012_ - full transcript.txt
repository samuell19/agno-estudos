Aravt literally means "Ten Families" It was a unit of the decimal system that was employed to control both civilians and the military in ancient Mongolia It was also the smallest unit of its army During the 13th century, Genghis Khan fought to unite the Mongolian tribes Once, after a particularly fierce battle, a terrible plague spread amongst his men Khan ordered a single Aravt unit to find the Master Physician in remote mountains Greetings, my Lord How is your Aravt? The battle is over. We are returning home The battle with Hulin tribe has proved that your Aravt soldiers are true warriors Commander Tsahir But now is not the time to return home There is still an important mission for you His Majesty has ordered you to invite the Master Physician from Hulin tribe I will, my Lord Please accept the Great Khan's command This mission concerns thousands of lives Be careful In order to locate the Master Physician, The Aravt heads to the Hulin tribe's settlement that has just been recaptured by Genghis Khan The rebel Hulin army is still active In this dangerous mountain forest, what is awaiting the Aravt? Let's leave this place Check the area You, come with me I shouldn't have let you return home My son? My son? Where is my son? Find him! Now! Stay away from me! Leave me alone Get away. Away! Here, use this to make a fire Bukhtenger I'm starving Who isn't? Why can't you bear it? I would rather die than always be hungry Just let me have a bite, Bukhtenger If I gave it to you, what would the rest eat? Stay away from me Maybe then you can have some tea Here Make a fire A glutton is silenced with a scrap of food I once asked him his favorite meal He said whatever can fill his stomach Am I right, Sulbekh? Of course! How wonderful to have a full stomach! I heard a noise When I went back, I found this child I couldn't bear to leave it behind. So I took him with me It seems this child is the lucky one It's not easy raise a child Someone must take care of him Uujim likes children. Just give the child to him I would rather just leave it here with only a sheep's tail to suckle on Give him to sleepy Uujim Don't cry Perhaps this child will grown up a hero Heekher? Why didn't you consult with us before bringing the child with you? Lord, already Sulbekh is begging for food And now we have another mouth to feed It's the first time Bukhtenger makes sense And I've known him for such a long time Do we really need another mouth? Sulbekh One more person may increaes our luck But who can care for this child? Don't look at me. I don't know how Why do I always have to do women's work? Bukhtenger You are the most cautious and gentle Whoever brought him should take him Don't expect me to care for him Father, did I do wrong? Saving a life is always right Ready to go? Bring the child Bukhtenger, tighten your saddle Hold this wolf food for a moment What a poor little thing Why must Bukhtenger curse him like that? It's not a curse Then what does he mean? According to our custom, only a true hero can be eaten by wolves What? Why? He expects this child to grow up a hero Come on. Give him back to me The ashes are still warm. They're near Lord, let's camp here I'm so hungry You'd really die for a full stomach Is this the Master Physician's homeland? I heard he leaves the mountain in winter From summer you can't find him anywhere Nobody seems to know where he really lives Grandpa, the herbs are growing fast Yes, the wind and rain have been good Let's collect some more After his defeat, Hulin tribe's leader, Hukhtumur, planned to travel west But after years of battle, he fell ill Only the Master Physician can save him Offense is always the best defense A good show Nachin... Nachin... You'll wear out that sheepskin The more I rub it, the softer it gets A well-rubbed sheepskin is like silk The one who wears it will live long Thanks for your kind wishes In old age, grandchildren are everything Let's finish our mission quickly, and return home earlier Yes, my Lord Did anyone find footprints? Master, they've left the mountain Look, there're footprints here Perhaps it's only deer No, it's something even bigger Maybe we could have a real feast I'll look around. You fetch some water At war, you must be as fierce as a wolf, and as agile as a leopard Something is happening Be quiet We're being followed Perhaps they've been following us because of the child Let's just hang the boy on that tree and let them find him there Whether we return the child or not, they won't let us go that easily They'll assume we slaughtered their people We shouldn't have taken the child We haven't completed our mission yet We can't take care of so many things There's no point in arguing No one has the heart to abandon the boy Be quiet and keep moving The Holy Sky God Tenger will protect us My humble greetings Your father Hukhtumur is a wise man Taking the Master Physician means securing the Sky God's magical medicines Was anything strange on your journey? Nothing. Is something bothering you? We can't be too careful. My Lord, it's too dangerous to stay Even after we broke up his army, our enemy Hukhtumur is still here, searching for the Master Physician What? Hukhtumur? Yes Just now, a group went to meet with him and have the Physician with them Where is Shijirsanaa? I don't know. We split up at the river He might be hiding from the enemy It's truly a small world We never expected Hukhtumur to be here Hukhtumur must have killed the child's family My Lord, let's just capture the Physician No, we can't do that What then? Should we just stand by and do nothing? Let's watch and see what happens first Quiet My Lord, the Physician's lives over there Is it really the Physician's camp? Yes, it is Put on your armor Hurry up. Lead the way Okay Your pulses indicates your poor health, therefore you must rest and recuperate I've already told you many times Master Physician, how can I remain calm? After my tribe has been scattered just like sand with nobody to lead them? We all live upon the same grassland We are all descended from the same ancestor There is no need to fight one another Why can't we all unite under the Sky God? Wouldn't it be better to be one nation? I wish for that too I don't have a strong hand to guide me, so I have to take reckless gambles If you were to stand by me and assist me, I would surely unify the whole nation I understand that you and your ancestors have always hated the Kyiyan Mongolians The best way to conquer is to make peace Your words go straight to my heart Temujin and I have fought for decades I cannot end up as his slave Harkhor, the son of Hukhtumur, is giving chase to the Aravt to rescue his son and avenge his people The Aravt seeks the Master Physician and are about to face a great danger Follow the river so as not to leave a trail Have you found them? Master Where are they? My Lord, I lost them My Lord... I met her yesterday What's wrong, my child? Grandpa, Harkhor and Bukha are approaching Father, why are you still here? An Aravt is closing in on us What? Aravt? They passed by my father-in-law's camp, killing my wife and stealing away my son I chased them but lost them in the forest Only ten people. They're not after us They surely want the Master Physician? Don't think too much, take him with you I won't leave here without cutting off their heads Don't be so bull-headed My life is in the Physician's hands If I can stay alive until I reach Xisha, I'll make an alliance with its king, defeat Temujin and take the grasslands These are the most important things Only then can we take our lands back Hurry and secure the camp Mount the horses! Go! We're posting guards to protect you Miss, I'll gladly watch over you myself I'm only here to invite the Physician My name is Shijirsanaa We've been waiting three days Hukhtumur has strengthened his defense You won't get near my grandfather When do you plan to leave here? Tomorrow morning Then I must return now Is there any chance to save the Physician? Early tomorrow morning, he will pray to the mountain spirits I must leave now What's your name? Unumunkhlei Ahai, are we going go fight today? Why do you say that? Before every battle, you talk to the Sky God, don't you? Son, nobody wants to go into battle Ahai? Are you afraid of death? If you can't conquer your fear of death, you will die quickly and be forgotten A hero's death will be remembered always Our solders must fight without fear I am not afraid of dying like that What are you afraid of then? Becoming ill or injured, being a burden What a beautiful night Do you remember shooting fire arrows? Yes, I remember We were really good at that So were you I have to go now Unumunkhlei... I have something I want to say to you You lazy good-for-nothing! How many would have time to draw their swords before being butchered You sleep as troops pursue us Eter, I was only thinking of my mother, I don't know how I fell asleep Get up Don't worry, I'm awake now You were never meant to be a soldier Your father thinks you're already a warrior But just look at you... When I was a child, my father was killed in battle My mother was so sad when I joined the army She feared that she'd never see me again Eter I'm afraid I'll never feel her touch again If you sleep on duty again, you may never see you mother again Ok, go get some real sleep Uujim, a person with a mother won't die Let's set off early I must pray to the mountain spirits May the mountain spirits bless our journey Take some solders with you I don't need solders to make a sacrifice Let them stay here and prepare the horses I had a terrible dream last night The Almanac said that my life is in danger so I must be unusually cautious Little one, who are your parents? Master Physician! Who are you? I'm sorry to startle you. I am a solder with direct orders from Genghis Khan Praise to Genghis Khan My loyalty and devotion is steadfast But I am a prisoner, what can I do? The Aravt! Nachin, give him water It seems that... I cannot serve Genghis Khan in this life Commander, bring out the imperial gold plate Swear in front of the imperial plate that you'll help me fulfill my final wish Don't worry, I will help you Please save my granddaughter's life... My granddaughter... Granddaughter... Master Physician! Master Physician! There are troops in pursuit, we must go! Master, the Physician is dead This arrow killed him Unumunkhlei, I wasn't able to protect your grandfather I should have been there to save him Are you sure he's dead? Who killed him? Where is Harkhor? Go after her. Hurry! Grandfather... Grandfather, what happened to you? Please wake up! Nachin, how are you feeling? Nachin, drink some water My Lord Tsahir, I can't serve you anymore Leave me here Eter, your father and I have been good friends You and my son have to become friends According to custom, just help me die here Don't hesitate There's no time You must go Holy Sky God... dear ancestors... please accept our hero into your arms Poor Unumunkhlei The Physician's murderers aren't far I will take revenge for her As will I Poor Nachin, you prayed to your ancestors everyday, but couldn't have a decent burial, just left alone in the wilderness He was just followeding ancient tradition We are not to weep He must be watching us from above Our mission is to protect the Physician, now how can we face our great leader? The granddaughter has been kidnapped What do you want to do? I promised the Physician that I would protect her. I must save her We still have troops chasing us If we are to offend Hukhtumur again, don't you think we are asking for trouble? It was the Master Physician's final wish So you are willing to die for a girl? I don't want to die for such stupidity I'd rather be punished by our great leader I cannot go back on my word I won't force you to join me "The flowers are blooming in summer" "Our yearning for home runs deep" Father, I made you angry once, do you remember? Did you? It was a foggy morning like today, I broke the halter when saddling the horse I don't remember that Now you are a warrior Give this sheepskin to Nachin's grandson What a foggy morning None of you should join me According to tradition, we must dress our horses in silver armour, before going into the final battle Although we don't have silver armour, we are loyal to you. Alive or dead, we are all brothers We must take care of Nachin's descendents We'll talk after completing our mission Ten friends bound together in life and death Let's move On your knees! There's no need. Please sit Your grandfaher's death is unfortunate He always said that you were special Master, please take your medicine This way! They've escaped. Catch them! My son! It's time for the last battle, I can see my horse in silver armour I will be a hero Bukha Bukha Where am I? You are close to death, my master What are you saying? You rotten slave I will not be your slave any longer Serve my grandfather in hell Why are you doing this? Bukha I burned your in-law's camp, killed your wife I left your son alive for the enemy I shot the doctor so that your father will die I don't want to go with Hukhtumur I never knew you were so dark and evil I'll be the leader of Hulin tribe You and your father are obstacles in my way Once I have sent your father to Genghis Khan, my dream will have come true Honorable Harkhor from Hulin is dead! A soldier who fails his mission must die I give my life to fulfill my vow as a warrior My master, I have terrible news What happened? Is everybody dead? Master, I'm deeply sorry for your loss Tell me How did my son die? Your son was a true hero. He died in battle Arrogance does not befit a hero But you are truly brave and invincible The Aravt is here. We must get away Keep running Bukha Great. With horses we'll be fine The horses have saved us I am the leader of Hulin now How about becoming my wife? How could you... If I killed your grandfather, would I have saved you? Uujim! Heekher! My child, my son Heekher, my sworn friend Completing a missions is a solder's duty Just as blood and milk cannot mix Sometimes duty conflicts with human nature In such a situation, Aravt soldiers are not only loyal warriors but also merciful people My Lord, please accept my repentance I failed my mission I only brought the Physician's granddaughter What?! I ordered you to bring the Physician Yes, My Lord The Master Physician's death is my fault I'll take full responsibility What's done is done. You must be punished According to ancient law, return your army's flag, and end your life Send away your Aravt My Lord, I accept the punishment Wait! Please forgive him Tsahir sacrificed his troops and his own son to save my grandfather and I If you punish this loyal warrior without understanding the true situation, you will surely regret it later Unimolihe, please stop I disobeyed the imperial edict I deserve to die You are wrong You're not guilty. You are a great warrior You saved my life Please allow me to beg for mercy Commander, please forgive him My grandfather taught me all he knew I can take the place of my grandfather Please forgive Commander Tsahir If that is true, please stand up You came to me to ask for punishment By this, you've shown your loyalty and bravery I will beg for mercy from Khan What else do you want to say? Please allow me to adopt this child You may Since your Aravt saved his life, name him Aravt I hope he grows up to be a great warrior This is a story about an Aravt On the grasslands of Mongolia, there were countless Aravt stories They have contributed to our great history Their descendants have kept this spirit of honour and loyalty without end BDRipped by jirro 2012
