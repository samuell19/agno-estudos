He's going to get a cigar. Oh, God! I'm Oszkar Sajek. lm not seeing anyone. Send him away. Please would you leave’? - | want only five minutes. - Close it! You knew my father. - You used to appear together... - No! - ...in Circus Busch. International boxing parade. In the blue corner: Johnny the kangoroo from Australia. With his 300 kg punches. In the red comer: Simi the welter-weight. The match is conducted by the limping referee. I'll never do such a stupid thing again. May | come in? Of course. If you can. Good afternoon! Look! You're the spitting image of your father. Just like Sajek. Are you alone? | hope I'm not disturbing you. - How are you? - Fine. They removed the plaster two months ago. That's a pity. You could have collected some famous people's autograph. Can you play chess? Of course. | got this number, jumping off drums... from 3 meters. It was good and succesful but once | didn't landed properly and that was that. | castled my king. - It's funny. - What? That you live here, like this, in this hotel. Come on, move! This is where | was booked before the war. Who booked you here? Morgan. Do you know him’? - May | call you Uncle Lipi? - You may. He instructed his banker to book me into this hotel. For 50 years. He liked my number. Your queen. And this Morgan... How many times did he see you on stage? Are you joking? Once. In Philadelphia. He must have been an original guy. To loose such a game! “Morgan its original"! “An oroginal guy"! I'm original and not Morgan. Now, why did you come here, my son’? Please, sell your number to me. - What? - This one. The one Morgan was in love with. That's antique. Out of the date. No one wants to see it tioday. - Really? - | bought it. You're throwing your money away. This was the greatest illusion in the world. 10 hours in a block of ice without oxigen! 48 hours. And not only without oxigen but at -30 degrees too. As if you have stripped naked on the Antarktis. And you were holding your nose. Then you shake yourself and hopp... | buy it. | inherited this number from my father and he from his father. You don't squander family inheritance. Your father was a great clown. | respected him a lot. Didn't he leave you anything? He died suddenly. | don't want visitors any more. Can you understand, my son? Whatever you want for it, I'll give you. Now looking at you | think with that limp you've found your place. The kangoroo number is a serious thing. Of course dolphins are better. Right? The other half here. Now go out of the room and lock it. Put the key in your pocket. Right? | only want the number. | sell you this for 50,000 because | like you. The Philadelphia attraction. - Nothing else? - Nothing else. You aren't good enough for that. - How do you know? - | know. Learn to play chess. We could play a game every now and then. Are you still here? “My dear mummy please buy me a yoyo, a yoyo, a yoyo.” Did you sleep well’? Look, the great Sajek! He can even play with a yoyo. Here. | gove it to you. You're the greatest. Greater than Houdini. K6ny6érgém, adja nekem! No use of flattering me. I'm an extremely wicked person. Why do | have to wake up and see the same thing every morning? You could stop this until | move out from here. Maybe it could be operated. These days they can replace everything. Heart, kidney, teeth. Truly. They replace everything. The time may come when people can only recognize you by your fingerprints. Truly... - Don't... - Why? Only his name... Come on. Who wants to see a kangoroo? Do you think I'll bring him floweres every year? You were right, we have fo stop. How many kangoroos can you buy in a lifetime? They all die of heart attack. Why don't you buy turtles instead? You could train them for 200 years. Come on! | was joking. - | almost fell intot the ditch laughing. - No, don't. Not a nice way to die. Why? Do you know a nicer way? Kangoroos need a circus where people don't aplaud, don't laugh, don't make any noise. A circus where people would stand up ...in silence until the curtain falls. Do you understand? They are only moved. Sajek. Let's buy a kangoroo together. I've got a contract in Holland. Where are we going? Are you scared? ..used to make disappear in his kitchen... ..some guys. He did it as a hobby. Forever. Start packing. Hey! Good bye. | can hear you. It's bloody cold in there. You're hot blooded my son. You need a number with an oven. It's almost hopeless. At nights I'll sleep in a fridge... - It's not that... - I'll beg someone to let me into a cold storage house. - The problem is you can't be on your own. - On my own? Yes. You've got claustrophobia. - Me? Uncle Lipi... - Yes. A well developed claustrophobia. - You're afraid to be locked in. - I'm not. - You're alone inside the ice. - You would be scared. - But | wouldn't. - You would, you would, you would. - Let's bet. - Agentleman never bets when he's sure he's right. - Let's bet! Lock me up anywhere for a week. Once | was mailed in an ice-cilinder from North America to South America. Yes. - Please mail me too. - Come on. Uncle Lipi! Uncle Lipi! | beg you, try me! Mr Lipot Binder, Budapest. Jézsef boulevard, National Hotel. They'll find it. Well... 200 bottles of champagne. One ton of salmon. 500 goose livers. “What's is in your basket, Mrs Léderer?" “Kudelka's hands, head and feet.” Aren't you ashamed of yourselves? | thought he was your friend. | knew Mr Binder would stop it. Come out, my boy! Bye. I'll write a letter. Close it. So, what shail we put on it? Content? Human being! - Hey! Don't write that. - Let's say fragile. Take him away. We'll celebrate this, my boy. Hush... Opera. - Who is this? - My friend from the Metropolitain. Dinner? Icecream. Champagne. Looks nice. | won. What did you do? - | won the bet. - You did. Congratulations. Don't you like icecream? - Cheers. - I'm fit enough. Look what | organised for you. Let's not spoil the evening. So you won't give it to me. Why should I’? The problem is they serve every drunkard here. Asenil old man. A monster! He'll ruin you. If your father were alive... Or somebody... She was a tall brunette. Binder adored her. A tall one... Adored by Binder... Szeréna... But Szerena who? Oh, God... Look... I'll find it... Szeréna... Artistes’ Magazine, in the back... List of artistes working in the Budapest Circus. A crowd of 5,000 were waiting to see me at the New York railway station. In Paris the owner of a club gave me a car as a present. At 1929 | was awarded the order of honour. And for 30 years nobody asked if even | was alive. Stay here! I'm the only one left in Hungary who can dance beguine. You used to be more chic... | go to houses of culture these days. That's what | live on. And you? The boy who brought you here. Sajek. He promised you things? What did he promise you? That | would find you here. - And? - And you're here. What is he to you? - Why? - You've always had a heart of gold. If someone cryed you were moved. Don't give him the number! | realised immediately. That's not why | came here. My dear Binder, don't you get bored in this hotel? | play chess. Championship by correspondence. I'm among the top ten in the country. You're shivering. You're a great man, Lipi. You've always been. Now what do you want? My little Lipi, | hope you forgive me that | left you without a clue. - | left you. - Your memony's failed, Lipi. If you call me Lipi once again I'll slap you. | had a lot of women. That's a bit of an exaggeration. You only loved me. That's interesting. And you? You had a family. | had a family. And then nothing. So, you were a whore, Szeréna. Roll it continously and not too fast! Mind your tighs. Not so fast, my dear Vitko, we'll get dizzy. Uncle Lipi! An evening with program? It isn't good. You need beautiful people for a number like this. Thanks for the party, Sajek. I've thought this thing over. One million. The price. You'll get the number for one million I'll bring it to you. I'll cover you with it, Uncle Lipi. A man in the ice. a brand new, fantastic attraction... ... performed by the world famous Hungarian escape artist, Mirandus. ..he had himself frozen in a block of ice, and he mailed by train from Philadelphia to New York. Reception at the railway station. When in Philadelphia the ice was broken up in presence of well known doctors, They found his heart, its condition satisfactory. It's him. The young Lipot Binder. This was the only number Houdini couldn't ever do. The old man was the only one who did it for the first and last time. I'm going to be the second one. That is 300 dollars for 2 performances a day. And if | only give 200 performances a year, that is 60,000 dollars. The computer. That's wonderful but what have we got to do with it? | ask a loan from you. One million. One million as an investment. This is a daylight robbery. - That's the price. - If he wants 1 million he should be reported to the police. But that's the price, really. And you can't divorce from this idiot’? Consider yourselves as shareholders. You won't regret it. You invest a certain sum and | guarantee 10% profit in a year. Nowadays saving accounts bring you 5%. You as shareholders will receive 10% from Oszkar Sajek. And if it becomes a flop? Sorry. My attorney. A lot of people know me. I'm Dr Emil Sztics, I'm an attorney. - We'll give security to everyone. - What a fraud! According to my initial information the Lloyd insurance company guarantees it. Do you understand? If | fail, you'll get your share anyway. It's in your interest that | kick the bucket. Stop this immediately! Why is this such a great attraction? | saw Charlie Rivers in London, he only had a chairand it was a famous attraction. Simi, you have 60,000. Someone has to start. | need that for the kangoroo. You can buy the kangoroo another time. | must buy that kangoroo. How much is a kangoroo these days? 100,000. Let's put up together one million and buy 10 kangoroos. And deep-frooze them. The second ice age. A kangoroo ice show. Suppose that you get your million. You couldn't do the number after your accident. I'm in good shape. You know well how persistent | am. And if you didn't buy these neon lights for the shop? You lose more on poker one night than the amount you'd have to put it. | know you have some hidden money. | know from Sylvia that you have some money. You have just been paid for one of your inventions. That's none of your business. Listen! You knew my father very well. Very well. Once he pulled you out of the shit, didn't he? Sajek! You're my best friend. Kangoroo. Who are you? And you, you and you? Who are you? And you? Who are you? That round headed guy on the screen knew who he was. He didn't needed to introduce himself. Go on doing your kangoroo number and train me too. I've got 5 years. 5 good years. Lock me up behind bars, give me some candy, and I'll push my tongue out whichever way. That's what the public wants, right? The public should stare and gape. That's what they are supposed to do. What an idiot | am. | thought you understand that this is also for you. - Come on! - Something will happen. Go home. The cinema is mine for another half an hour. What are you doing? Take your son to the crazyhouse. He's out of his mind. - He's dangerous. - Stop that. Everything's going to freeze. | couldn't use the fridge for days. All right, I'll arrange this. Go away. This is madness. You know that there is no sense in it at all. That's what you say. You've always considered madness everything. You can't blame me for his broken leg. Come off it, Boldi! The world is enormous. Not really. | got lost. Yes, indeed. One can't tear this out, it's fixed in the concrete. Where have you been? City Kecskemét. Brodway of Nyékladhaza. Fifty avenue. Every circus is the same. I'm a bull. Pergaps if | got married... That's better than winning the pools. If there would be 100,000 copy of me! Isn't that too many? - On the frontpage of a magazine, - In colour, right. | would breath fire. Like a gas eruption. I've grown old. Boldi, | need one million. I'm falling asleep. It's the dedalon. I've shoved some up my ass when | arrived. | need it for not to vomit because of the spirit. Listen, I've done it. The old man is willing to give the number. For one million. In that case Canaan has arrived. One million? Tomorrow we'll sell the house. What's that hiccup for? I'm never in Budapest. And when you return it I'll buy another. One million. You can't even breath properly, my boy. Never mind. | got it. I'm not giving you that number. The number is me. And it's not for sale. Why are you doing this to him? Houdini was born here. | found it in the records. This is where Dandy Jackson worked as caretaker. Once he was buried under 2 tones of sand. He survived. This is where the nazis took Zoli the clown. He didn't survive. This is where Lipot Binder kissed Lulu Schenk, the hypnotizing phenomen. Here was the garden. The heat, starry night. Dance. What are you crying about? If | give it to him, he'll never come to see me again. One million. What would you do? Just like that. Saying I'm sorry | don't want it. And you'd give me back. - You know what you are, Sajek? - Now, Boldi... - You're full of shit. Really full of shit. But what's the matter? It's all here. What's the matter? Nothing at all. Nothing at all. Thank you very much but... You think I'm the biggest fool of the world? - No, I... - | sold my house. You offered it to me, didn't you? You did offer. - Because you said he would sell the number. - But you said he would. - But you said he would. - Because he said it. But now he's changed his mind. He's changed his mind. My dear Boldi, he's just like that. He says one thing and he changes his mind. Well | hought... Who the hell cares about what you thought? - I've been living in this damned caravan from 20 years. - My dear Boldi! I'm not your dear Boldi, you louse. You told me you need one million. Because he would sell the number. | sold the house and you told me you would take me into the business. What shall | do with that big amount of money? These are only shitty banknotes. I've always had something, my house. What the hell have | got now? | myself was taken in. -Get lost quickly. - It wasn't my fault. You re a liar. | sold the house. Because you lied that you were going to buy that number. But I've lost my house. Get out! | was fooled. | was fooled. Get lost and if | catch sight of you again I'll kill you. - Uncle Lipi! - How many hours you spend sitting here? I'm watching them. You can never know enough about them. | haven 't seen them for a while. He broke down. This whole thing made him ill. Do you know why | wanted to see you? I'll sell it to you. - Let me see you. - But... | don't understand. Stand up! Come here! Turn around! Open your mouth! Breath deep so | can inspect your chest. That's something. Bravo. But Uncle Lipi, I've already started with kangoroos. Kangoroos... Dogs, crocodiles, bears. Torturing animals... You'll get a world famous attraction. An Oscar. - You can collect it in Chicago next year. - Sajek is my friend. Remember my son, there's no friendship in love matters and career. - How much? - 1,39. Worse than yesterday. | don't know how pearl divers can do it. What's the matter? Are you depressed? And slowly the absorption of oxigen will change. Not like that. You don't go to see him anymore. He'll come to see me. How much? Oh, | forgot to check it. Are you crazy? What's the matter? And what if he never gives it to you? - You're not even in the running. - Nice of you to warn me. - Did you get a notice? - Yes. It says get lost. So that you could get in. You're not the only one. - Say that again. - You're not the only one. Traitor! Everybody is a traitor. - You don't dare to get out of it? - You bastard traitor! - He did me in too. - He gave it to you... - He gave it to you? - No, the bastard, he didn't. Let's start all over again. - All right! - Your excellency, which suit would you like to wear on the party? The grey one, the velvet one or your tails? What party? Your car. Good morning. The boat is coming. - Have a nice meal. - And you. The famous escape artiste. You can try to escape now if you can. Nobody saw us leaving. Some strawberry jam? - Is there any whipped cream? - Just a moment. Everything can be yours, Uncle Lipi. Even freedom. It's nice here. How do you do it? Shall i tell you’? You haven't got anything to do? Sit down on your arse. | won't. lI kill you. Good morning. The boat is coming. From now on I'm not eating anything. Until you tell me. - You'll be hanged for this. - No matter. Me? Tell you? You will tell me. You will tell me. You will... Oh, my God... Never. Never. What makes this day different from the others? - What does? - Passover. It's the eve of Passover. What Easter is for us Passover is for you. What happened, little Sajek? Did you buy a Talmud? My heart is about to break. Tough guy. Well, my boy, put everything off the table. I'd rather do it myself. Let's leave this, shall we? Passover eve. And it isn't dark yet. Let's wait. Give me my hat. - Who? - The prophet Eliah. - He's drunk some wine. - Come on. Not a drop is missing. - He's been here. - Superstition. You know, | had a son in 1942. But this is a nice feast you've made. Nice family feast. Now go and find matzo. How did you know? They usually hide it for children. All right. I'll find it. Now wish something. Well, | wish... ... [wish you could make up a wonderful number yourself. Good evening. Have you been on holiday, Mr Binder? - You look great. - We returned from an excursion. - Why not? - No... - Pfew, you pig. -No.. Where are you going? Did you called me, Uncle Lipi? God! The way he's lying... Oh, my God... How many sweaters have you got on, mate? Aren't you cold? I'm going to be. - And how much is left? - 65 seconds. A man in the ice coffin. and see themselves that the ice is real. Is it cold in there, mister? Perhaps he can't hear me. And suppose he can't break the ice’? He'll suffocate. - Now! - No. He's got 10 seconds left. Now. Now. I'm not here. Go on! Come on! Come on! Don't be scared. That's it. You'll get a nice T-shirt. And also gloves. Don't worry. Come on. Up! Up! A big kick! That's it. Good. Great. Get closer. The rhythm. Keep the rhythm. Great! Keep it! Up! Lift it up! Pull it! That's very good, Simi! That's it get closer. Come quite close. | can get along by myself. Would you please shut up? | could show you. Come here. Stand up! Good. Pull your shirt into place. Great. That's it. Not just your hands, use your legs too. Kick! Come on! Bandi, pull it up! You think you don't need me any longer? Hush. Don't shut, you know how sensitive they are. You've got a world famous attraction, you idiot. What more do you want?
