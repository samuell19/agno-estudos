- I spent 3 days being eaten by mosquitoes to get those shots. No, the model stinks. Well, next time tell your client not to use his niece. No, I get that. Believe me, I understand but I have a full schedule. I can't just drop... Nice tie. - What? You don't like it? - You look like a Christmas tree. I understand all that and I have no problem reshooting the pictures, my problem is reshooting them for free. Okay. All right. Well, let me know what you decide. Bye. I might have to reshoot the Beach Croft campaign. - So, you're going back to Mexico? - If they pay me. The client's niece wants to be a model so he insists I use her. In every sexy shot, she looks like she's constipated. What time will you be home? - Probably not until late. There's a conference at the Hyatt and then drinks. - You want me to meet you at the bar? - Not a good idea. I'll be working. See you later. - Bye. - Morning! - Morning. - How was it, Polly? - Very good, thank you. - Good. Oh, Harry, Harry, hang on. - So, any word on when McBradden is going to announce the promotion? - Not yet. - Well, in the meantime, you have a 9 o'clock with Peter Kurtzman, lunch with Dan Adler and then over to the Hyatt for an exciting seminar on cutting edge communications. Ooh. - Is there something else? - You're not really going to wear that tie, are you? - Is there any way to get out of this thing? - You could quit. [ Laughs ] Well, McBradden rented out the bar for after the seminar. He won't be too pleased if his frontrunner doesn't show up. - Whoa, a frontrunner? - And you my friend, have the best performance record. - How many other VPs have you said that same speech to? - Hmm,3, or is it 4? - I've taught you too well. [ Laughs ] - Hold the door! Thanks. - Who's that? - That is Rebecca Walker. She transferred out from the Chicago office a few days ago. [ Chattering and laughter ] - So, Rebecca, what did you think of the seminar? - I think we should record it and sell it as a sleeping aid. [ Laughter ] - You know, Jerry's up for the national VP position as well. - How cozy. - Well, I hope this doesn't mean we're adversaries. - No, it just means that when I get the promotion, you'll be under me. - Ooh. I think that's a position I could learn to like. - Would you please excuse me? - I told you to go easy on the booze, Jerry. - Damn it! I'm so stupid. I can't believe I said that. All right, look, I've got to go apologize. - Ms. Walker. - Thanks. - Have fun. [ Knocks ] - [Rebecca]: Who is it? - It's Jerry Dennings. - [Rebecca]: Go away, Mr. Dennings. - I... I just wanted to apologize. [ Door opens. ] Can I come in and apologize or... do I have to do it in the hall? [ Zippers ] You're up early. - You're home late. - Well, Donald and I had a bit too much to drink, so we decided to play it safe and get a room. Look, I'm sorry I didn't call. It was pretty late, I didn't want to wake you. - I thought maybe we'd go out to dinner tonight. - No, I can't. I have to take some clients out to dinner. - I don't even know why I even bother trying to make plans with you anymore. - Shannon, I am working, trying to make a life. - And does this life include me? - We're not going to go into this now, are we? - When do we ever go into it? Every time I try to talk to you, you're running out the door to some meeting or you're too tired. - I can't have this conversation now. I've got to be in the office in a half-hour. We will talk tonight, I promise. - Oh, Mr. McBradden called down. He wants to see you. - Okay. - No, he said right away. - Mr. McBradden's expecting me. [ Knock ] - Please, you know James Corbin from legal? - Yeah, how are you? - I'll get straight to the point. Rebecca Walker told us what happened last night. [ Nervous laughter ] - Oh. This is a little embarrassing. We were all in the bar after the seminar, I had a few drinks too many. I didn't mean for it to happen. It just did. - So what she says is true? - Yeah. But I had the impression when we left that we understood each other. I don't see why she had to come to you guys with this. People say stupid things sometimes. I apologized... - Jerry, this isn't about something you said. - She claims you sexually assaulted her in her room last night. - She says you came on to her. When she asked you to leave, you became aggressive, throwing her down on the bed, ripping her blouse. It wasn't until she began to scream that you left. - That never happened. - We spoke to Donald. He said he saw you go into her room, and then he heard the screams. When he got there, her blouse was torn and she was crying hysterically. - I went into her room, yes. We had a drink, I apologized for what I said in the bar, and then I left. Malcolm, you've known me for 10 years! I wouldn't do this. - Can we look at your shoulder? - What for? - She says that while she was fighting you off, she hit you with a lamp. I imagine it would leave a mark. - I have a bruise on my shoulder. I tripped on my way out to my car the other night. - Jerry, Mr. McBradden is prepared to offer you what I feel is a very generous opportunity under the circumstances. - Opportunity? - The morals clause of your contract specifically states that any indiscrete behaviour that reflects badly on the company name can result in dismissal and forfeiture of all bonuses and stock options. - You are firing me? - We're giving you a chance to resign and seek counselling. Your bonus for the year will be prorated and you'll receive 50% of your stock options. - But I didn't do anything! - Take the offer, Jerry. - And if I don't? - You'll be dismissed, publicly embarrassed and you'll forfeit everything you've worked for. - I expected more from you, Malcolm. - I started this company selling transistor radios out of the back of a truck. I'm not going to let you drag its image into the gutter because you can't keep your pants zipped up! - It never happened. - Why would she make up a story like this? - I don't know. - You did flirt with her. - A little, yes. - In front of everyone? - I drank too much. - Bull! Don't blame it on the alcohol. - All right, all right, I flirted with her, Shannon. Yes, I mean we haven't had sex in 4 months, okay. - And that's my fault? - Well, you are half this marriage. - I'm not the half that had the affair! - I knew you would bring this into it. - You cheated on me and now you are asking me to believe that nothing happened? - I thought it was behind us. - What world do you live in? You think it's behind us because you apologized and sent me some flowers. I trusted you and you betrayed that trust. - Shannon! I made a mistake. - Maybe you made another one. [ Sighs ] - I need you to believe me. - I don't know if I can do that right now. - Shannon, they want me to resign. If I did, we would lose half of everything I've worked for. - If you don't, we lose everything. I think you should resign. - How can you say that? - Because I'm your wife and I don't know if I believe you. They're giving you a chance to go quietly. - This is business. There is no such thing as quietly. I mean, you don't think this will follow me? You think there are other companies that will be lining up to hire me? I put 10 years of my life into that company, 10 gruelling years. McBradden throws me out like a bag of garbage? - I'd like you to not be here when I get back from Mexico. We need some time apart. [ Chatting ] - I won't resign. - You don't have a choice. - If Miss Walker is telling the truth, then she can file criminal charges against me and we will settle it in court. But I will not be judged by you. - I tried to give you a way out and do what's right for the company. - Oh, that is crap, Malcolm! You're doing what's best for you. - Get out! - If you try to push me out, I will sue. - You're fired. - I wish you would have waited for me. - I gave him the opportunity to resign. - You pressured him to resign. - This is my company and I can fire anyone I damn well please. - No, you can't. You're his employer, you're supposed to be impartial. You formed an opinion and took a position. That's not going to help us when he fights this. - You mean, "if" he fights this? - His attorney's already contacted me. They're suing, Malcolm. You better hope this woman's telling the truth. - You wanted to see me? - Jerry Dennings is filing a lawsuit. - Oh, and that surprises you? - Frankly, yes. - Well, if he took whatever you offered him, that's as good as saying he's guilty. Of course, he has to fight this. - Mr. McBradden has taken a strong position in your behalf. - Oh, I see, and now you're wondering if you're backing the right person. Yes. - I must say the incident doesn't seem to have affected you. - I'm tough, Mr. Corbin. I mean, do you think I got where I am today by letting my emotions show? Men see tears as weakness, so I've learned to shut them off. But that doesn't make what Jerry Dennings tried to do to me any less traumatic. - We'd like to arbitrate this. - Arbitration might have been a viable avenue if my client hadn't been fired. - Well, what if he could be reinstated? - No. I'm not going to let you take McBradden's foot out of his mouth. - How's your client going to pay for a lengthy trial? - With the 30 million dollars he wins from you. [ Chuckles ] - Let me point out to you how things are in the real world. We've got signed statements from several people stating Mr. Dennings was drunk and obviously hitting on Ms. Walker. Donald Fuller saw him enter her room and heard her scream, and on top of everything, he has a history of psychological problems. - He doesn't have psychological problems, he had a stress problem. - What he had was a nervous breakdown. A year ago he snapped like a twig during a staff meeting. If I were you, I'd start thinking about what's best for my client. - If I were you, I'd start thinking about why Mr. McBradden was so quick to form an opinion. - Because of the evidence. - Evidence? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know McBradden Communications was a court of law. - Mr. McBradden was protecting his employees. - No, he was protecting himself and his precious company image. - You can't win this case. [ Sigh ] - We're prepared to let a jury decide that. - [Donald]: Yeah, all right. - Donald. I'm Frank Schaeffer, I'm an investigator with the legal division here. - Oh, you're here about Jerry Dennings, right? - I was hoping you could tell me what happened at the hotel. - Well, I've already said he had a little too much to drink. - Right. I was hoping you could give me a little insight into Mr. Dennings in general. - I can tell you that he is a good friend of mine. - Okay, I understand. Loyalty's a good thing. I hope Mr. McBradden understands. - Excuse me? - Well, you made it clear that your loyalty rests with your friend and not to the man who pays your salary. - I'd be more than happy to do anything to help Mr. McBradden. - An affair. - Last year. It went on for five months. - That's not the best part. She worked here. - Where is she now? - We're trying to find her. - So, how's bachelorhood treating you? - This is great. - Listen, I think it's pretty crappy what they did to you. - Thanks. - They sent an investigator down to my office the other day. They know about your affair last year. I think they're going to try to make it look like you used your position to coerce her. Well, the good news is they can't find her. You haven't been in contact with her, have you? - No, no. She moved out of state. - Oh. Well, they're going to find her. Maybe you should call her, let her know they're coming. Do you know where she is? - What did they promise you, Donald? A corner office? A raise? What? What's the going rate these days to betray your friends? - It's just business, Jerry. - You ungrateful creep. I gave you your job. - I've got a career to think about. - What about my career? - Business-wise, you're dead. You just haven't laid down yet. - Get out. [ Laughs softly ] - I was surprised you called. - Really? Why? - Well, when I asked you to leave you didn't seem too upset about going. - Well, that's not true. I was. But I understood... Listen, Shannon, whatever happens I just need you to know that I didn't do this. But I know that I really hurt you and I am sorry. I just... I just never realized it before. - Now you do? - Well... that last month in the apartment I had a lot of time on my hands to sit around and think about what really matters. Well, I was hoping maybe when all this is over, we could go away together. - Well, we'll see. - Kobrinsky is going to call you. He need to go over what you're going to say at the deposition. - All right. - You know, they're going to ask you about the affair. It's important you know what to say. - You're afraid of what I'm going to say at the deposition, aren't you? That's why you're here. You... you want the image of the supporting wife who believes her husband. - Do you think that little of me? - I don't know what to think of you anymore, Jerry. - Look, Shannon, I am here for us, okay? As for the lawsuit, you do whatever you feel comfortable doing. - So, it doesn't matter to you what I do? - No. I mean, yes. Of course it does, but that is not the only reason I'm here. Come on. Are you going to turn your back on the chance to make millions of dollars just because you're angry with me? - You don't have the slightest idea of who I am. - Shannon. - I have been such an idiot. - Shannon. - Before we begin, Mr. McBradden has instructed me to inform you that if you stop these proceedings now, he will not file charges of malicious prosecution against your client. - How generous of him. We'll pass. - How the hell do you think you can try this case? If you look at the evidence it's not hard to connect the dots. - Try connecting them this way: Ms. Walker is ambitious. My client was the frontrunner for the VP promotion. With him out of the way she had a pretty clear path to the job. It's my understanding she already occupies Mr. Dennings' old office. - It's the only open office on the floor. - You seem to be very good at climbing the corporate ladder, Ms. Walker. - This is absurd. - A while ago you worked for the Holmes-Jennings Company in Chicago. You filed a sexual harassment suit against a Mitchell Layton. The company settled for... awarding you $200,000 and a promotion to Senior Vice-President. - Those are confidential records. - After that you worked for the Weatherdale Corporation in Dallas. You filed another sexual harassment suit against your boss which resulted in his dismissal and an undisclosed sum for you. Why didn't you file criminal charges against Mr. Dennings? - Being an attractive woman in the workplace is an occupational hazard. If I filed charges against every man who came onto me, I'd be in court every day. - Tsk tsk. You're not saying he came on to you. You're saying he tried to rape you. - Mr. McBradden is very sensitive about his company's image. I thought the matter would be better handled internally. - And of course, Mr. McBradden would be beholden to you for your discretion. - I didn't ask Mr. Dennings up to my room, nor did I ask him to attack me, but if there's something to be gained from this then why not take it? - Rebecca... - Look, it's not my fault that men find me attractive or that they take a smile for more than what it is. - Rebecca, that's enough. - I mean do you have any idea what it's like to come to work and hear your colleagues talk about you like you're a $10 whore? Or to see them undress you with their eyes? Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Kobrinsky, that behaviour is inappropriate and unacceptable. - I can't wait to get her on the stand. - She's angry. I would be too if I was in her situation. - She has made a career out of sexual harassment suits. You really think the jury's going to find her a credible witness? McBradden Communications fired my client without just cause. It took the word of one employee over that of the other. Consequently, my client's reputation in the industry has been destroyed, his prospects for future employment are grim, he and his wife... - Save it! You're not addressing a jury right now. - You're on the ropes, James. If you want to stand there and get the tar knocked out of you, that's up to you. The longer it takes you to throw in the towel, the more expensive it's going to be. - So, how expensive would it be to get off the ropes today? - How does it feel to be Boston's newest millionaire? - I'm just glad it's over. - You think it's over? It's not over, Jerry. Do you hear me? It is not over! - Would you forget about Rebecca Walker? You've just won 10 million dollars. Can't you be happy about it? - Ah, you know something? I'd much rather this never happened. I liked my job, I liked the people I worked with. Ah, who knows. If this hadn't happened maybe Shannon and I would have been able to work something out. - Things will work out for the best. In the meantime, go out and do something for yourself. Pamper yourself. - We did it. - You shouldn't be here. So, how did McBradden take it? - Well, basically I'm not going to be getting that promotion. [ Soft laughter ] Personally, I think he'd like to fire me, but he's afraid. Jerry... we can't do this anymore for awhile. We shouldn't have even done it tonight. - Well, it was your idea, remember? - It was a bad one. No one can blow this now but us. We have to be smart. - I don't see why you just can't quit. - I think we should stick to the plan. You know, I stay on for another month or so and then resign because I feel there's no opportunity to grow in the company. - Maybe I should leave the country now. - Hey. If either one of us starts doing anything differently people are going to get suspicious. - Well... it just seems like such a long time. - Yeah, well 20 years in prison is a lot longer. - You bastard! You don't even have the guts to tell me you want a divorce! I find out through a process server! - It's better this way. - How could you do this? - Shannon, you don't have anything to worry about, okay. I will take care of you. - You think that's why I'm here? You never said anything about a divorce! - Well, I am saying it now. - I thought we were going to try to work things out. - Why? Why should we? - I can think of a lot of reasons. - Well, I am sure you can, Shannon. I am sure you can think of 10 million reasons. - Hey, thanks for coming over. We need to talk. - About? - Something's been bothering me and uh... I don't know how to say this... uh... - Just... open your lips and let some air out. - I think that Jerry Dennings might have known Rebecca Walker before that night at the hotel. - What makes you say that? - Well, I was talking to a friend of mine who works at Grown Pin Technologies and well, you know, we got around to talk about Ms. Walker. Uh, she says she remembers them talking at an executive convention last year in Chicago. - And so if they knew each other...? - Well, then why pretend they didn't? - I thought you were Dennings' friend? - I was. I'd just rather be Mr. McBradden's friend. [ Chuckles softly ] You knew about this? - That photo was taken a year ago. I found it about a week after the settlement. You see, it always bothered me how Walker's sexual harassment history kind of just came up just at the right time to discredit her. - So, you think they scammed the company? - Here's the expense account for Mr. Dennings from last year. What's circled there are his hotel expenses. - So, what? He travelled? He...? - I also pulled Walker's expenses for last year. Eight times they're in the same city, 4 of those times at the same hotel. - So, they did do it. They actually did it. Oh man, you've got to appreciate this. I mean, it's brilliant. - No, it's fraud. If it was brilliant, we wouldn't be having this conversation because we wouldn't know. - Shouldn't we go to McBradden with this? - Look, this could be an e-ticket ride for us, you know, if we play it right. We don't have enough right now to go to anybody. We go to McBradden with this and blow smoke up his ass and things don't fall into place, he's not going to be happy now, is he? - All right, yeah. - Now you haven't told anyone else about this, have you? - No, no. - All right. Good, good. Let's keep it that way for now. - All right, yeah. Sure. - We'll talk. - Right, right. - Jerry, have a seat. Poole, a pleasure to see you. Sorry for keeping you waiting. Mr. Dennings wants to be fair about this. - Define fair. - We're not prepared to make a proposal at this time. - Well, we are. Mrs. Dennings is asking for the primary residence, the mountain cabin will be shared and 50% of all assets. - [Scoffs]: You sure you don't want a pound of flesh? - We're talking about a 10 year marriage here. Mrs. Dennings has been there every step of the way. She's not the one who wants this divorce, she only wants-- - I agree. - Jerry? - Have the papers drawn up. - Are you sure you want to do this? - Absolutely. - We accept. - Jerry! Thanks. - For what? - For not making this ugly. - I told you I'd take care of you. - Oh, could you drop by the house tonight and get the rest of your things out of the office? - Sure, sure. - Great. - Is everything else all right with you? - Yeah. I started teaching a photography class. - Oh, yeah? Wow, that's great. - It's only a night class in the extension program, but... - Well, it's still teaching. - And you? - Nothing much. - Are you... seeing anyone or... - No. No, no, no. - You're just a man of leisure, huh? - Yeah, I guess. - Well, I... I should go. - Yeah, yeah, sure. Take care. - You too. Jerry? You should be happy. It's what you've always wanted, right? - Yeah. - Hmmph. - How the hell could this happen?! - How it happened isn't important. It's happened. - Well, who would know about it? We were so careful! - Well, obviously not careful enough. - Yeah, well what are we going to do about it? What?! What are we going to do?! - I don't know, Jerry! Nothing! Nothing. - Nothing? - We don't know what they want. We can't do anything until we know what they want. - Well, how do we know they haven't sent these to the police? - Because we're not in jail. - We don't know that. They could be waiting for us right now. - Would you please calm down. - Calm down? - Yeah. - Okay, look. I don't want to be negative or anything, but it kind of looks like our perfect crime has a little bit of a flaw. - Okay, listen to me. Listen to me. I need you to be strong, okay? Can you be strong for me? We're going to get through this, okay? But we have to do it together. Everything's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. Come here. Here. It's going to be okay. [ Phone ringing ] - Hello. - [Shannon]: Jerry, it's me. You were supposed to be here half an hour ago. - What? - You were going to come over tonight and get your things out of the office. - Uh. Well, that's it. Everything else is in the car. Uh... you know, I don't really feel like going home, I thought maybe we could have a drink. - Meredith is coming over. - Oh, okay. Look, I just wanted to say that I am sorry. - Don't. You never made excuses for your behaviour before, no need to start now. - Well, I just feel bad about it. I mean, we did share ten years together. - No, you lived here for ten years. You were never interested in sharing anything. - I'm not making excuses for what I did. - This is where you tell me how much you've changed, how you want to come back. - No, I don't want to come back. - What do you want? Absolution? Do you want me to tell you that it's all right, what you did and how you did it? I can't. You know, when we first broke up I... I was so scared. The thought of starting over again, living alone. I've realized now that I needed that time to find out who I really am. - Who are you? - Someone who's a lot stronger than I thought. - When's the last time you used that telephoto lens? - A few days ago. - Oh yeah? And what did you shoot? - Since when are you so interested in my work? - I was just wondering if any of the pictures might interest me. - Maybe. - Maybe? Maybe yes or maybe no. You wouldn't do anything to hurt me now, would you, Shannon? - What the hell is with you tonight? - Oh, what the hell is with me? What the hell is with me? - All right, I want you to leave now. This conversation is over and we are over. - Okay. - [Rebecca]: Hi, this is Rebecca. Leave a message and I'll call you back. - I need to see you. Meet me tomorrow at noon, up at the lake. - Hey. - So, what's so important it couldn't be said in my office? - Well, I've been thinking. You know, with the full arrest and my friend in Chicago's testimony that they knew each other, and the hotel charges, we have more than enough to go to McBradden with this. - Look, Don, look. I thought we agreed we were going to wait. - Yeah, but you know, I wondered what reason could he have not to pass along this valuable information, and then it hit me. You're going to shake him down. - Ha-ha! Why would I do that? - Well, that's what I'd do. Why settle for a pat on the back when you can get rich. - Let's say for a moment I was thinking of doing that. What would I need you for? - Get off the hypothetical crap. - What do I need you for? - You need me not to go to McBradden with this. - And that's worth what to me? - You know, I'm not greedy and I do realize you've done most of the work, so I'll take half. - Hey. - I think Shannon sent the photographs. - What makes you think that? - Because I went over to get my stuff last night, and she's got her cameras out with a telephoto lens. - Gerry, I think you're being a little paranoid. - Come on, Rebecca. Add it up. Who else is close enough to know what's going on? - Well, did you do what I told you with the divorce? - Yeah, yeah, she thinks she's getting everything she wants. - Okay, so then why would she do that? It doesn't make sense. - Yes, it does. Because this is payback. It's revenge. She wants to see me squirm. - Well, I hope you're right. - What? - Well, if it is her, she's not going to go to the police. I mean, she thinks she's getting millions of dollars, if you go so does the money. - Right. - Right. And if it isn't her, well they'll let us know what they want soon enough. Either way, we might have to leave quickly. - Wait a minute. I thought you said we shouldn't? - That was before the photographs. [ Rebecca sighs ] - Yeah, but then we were both going to slip away unnoticed. If we both just leave, we might as well sign a full confession. - Okay, so what are you saying now, you don't want to go? - Oh, no, no, no. I want to go, but I want to go the way we planned. I mean, I don't want to... I didn't do this so I could live in a third world country and look over my shoulder for the rest of my life. - Okay, okay, listen. All I'm saying is that we need to be prepared. It takes time to get ten million in cash together. Now, call the bank tomorrow and get them started and when they have it, transfer it to a safety deposit box. - Well, I don't see why we just can't wire it to where we're going. - Right, and maybe you'd also like to leave a little note telling the cops exactly where we went. Come here. - Mr. Dennings. My name's Frank Schaeffer. I'm an investigator with McBradden Communications. - Haven't you heard? The case has been settled. - You know, what we need to talk about should maybe be done in private. - Maybe you didn't hear me. The case has been settled. [ Chuckling ] - I know what you did. Relax, Jerry. I don't want you to go to jail. - Why would I go to jail? - Because you and Rebecca Walker ripped off McBradden for ten million dollars. Oh yeah. You see, I've got credit receipts showing you at the same hotel at the same time. I've got people who say that you knew her before the incident, and I've got photos. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Jerry, Jerry, don't act like you're innocent. You see, because you're not even good at it. Now, the way I see it this can go two ways: You can either continue to stand there and act dumb, in which case I go to McBradden with what I know. I believe that doesn't serve either one of our purposes now, does it? - Number two? - Number two: You give me five million dollars. - That's crazy! - That's the deal. - Well, that's hardly a deal. - Suit yourself, Jerry. - No, wait a minute! Wait a minute! Can't we discuss this? - We are discussing it, Jerry. We're just not going to debate it. - I know, I know... I can't think right now. - You know, I understand that, Jerry. You can't make this decision all by yourself, so you call Ms. Walker and then tomorrow at 10 o'clock, call me at my office, and I will tell you where to meet me with the money. - So, how did it go? - It's all set. - They agreed? - Oh, they will. They have no other choice. Why don't you meet me during lunch tomorrow. I need you to do something for me. - Uh, yeah. Sure, sure. - So this investigator, Schaeffer came to see me today... and he knows everything. Everything. He says that he wants half or he's going to go to McBradden. - We have to take off. - Do we want to take that chance? The guy's an investigator for crap sake. He could be watching us right now and we wouldn't even know it. - If we don't run, we have to pay him. - No. - No? What do you mean, no? What other choice do we have, Jerry? - We planned this and we took the risks, and I am not giving away half of it just because he happened to stumble on it. He's not going to go to McBradden. What does that get him? - So, you want to play poker with this guy? - Think about it. He goes to McBradden, he gets nothing. If we offer him a million, he'll take it. - Yeah, but then next month he'll come back and ask for another. - No, because once he takes the money, he's an accessory. He can't go to the police. [ Sigh ] - What if he doesn't take the million? - I'm not giving away 5 million bucks just because he says that's what he wants. We'll make it so he has no choice. - What you're talking about doing, Jerry, could be very dangerous. - I'm not letting that son of a bitch take half. - You still want to do this? - Yeah. - Okay. What did he say about the meeting? - He said for us to call him in the morning. - He probably wants to meet in the afternoon. You've got to give us some time. How would you describe him? - Confident, self-assured, really enjoyed watching me squirm. - Good. We want him to think that he's got it all covered. - He does have it all covered. - No, hmmph. Not all of it. He wants money. We're going to give it to him. Just not the way he thinks we are. You see, he thinks we're going to do everything exactly the way he wants. We can use this, because he won't be expecting what's going to happen next. Now, first thing in the morning I'm going to call down to accounting and get some information. When the bank opens, you take care of the money. At 10 o'clock sharp he'll call. [ Phone ] - Schaeffer. - Meet me in the park across the street. - [Rebecca]: His first impression of you will be the most important. He has to feel you know he's running the show. Be strong. - Did you bring the money? - [Rebecca]: But don't challenge him. - Of course not, but I'm not going to talk about this on the phone. - Fine, meet me at 4 o'clock at the park over at the south side... - Hey, how do I know once you get your money you're not going to come back asking for more? - I guess you just going to have to trust me, Jerry. - That's not good enough. You realize that once you get your share, you're as guilty as we are. - I know that. That's your guarantee. It's a little hard for me to go to McBradden or the cops to explain my involvement, so once I have the money I'm gone, all right? You'll never see me again. So, at 4 o'clock you'll meet me at the park on the south side. You know where that is? - No, no, no, no. I'm not meeting there. No way. - [Rebecca]: The moment you say that he's going to become suspicious. The reason you give has to make sense. - Look, I'm not going to come to a public place with Rebecca so somebody else can see us together and figure out what we did. - Then come alone. - Right now all she has is my word that you know. She's not going let me take the money without seeing it herself. [ Sigh ] - Look, when I go upstairs I'll talk to her. - If she doesn't have a problem with it, it's fine with me. - Fine. Pfft! [ Phone ringing ] - Yeah? - He's on his way. He'll be there in 5 minutes. - Okay. - Ms. Walker, there's a Frank Schaeffer here to see you. - When I know he's coming, I'll make the call. Corbin. I'm going to insist that we both go and we meet in a secluded spot. Now, he may argue at first, but soon he'll begin to realize it's his last hurdle to the money. Greed will kick in. He'll be so close he can taste it. [ Knocking ] As soon as Corbin sees me with him, Schaeffer's going to get nervous. He's not going to want to sit here and argue with me in front of him. - Frank. So, Rebecca what's so important? - Oh, it's all right, sir. I've taken care of it. - [Jerry]: I still don't understand how we get to meet him where we want. - [Rebecca]: We don't. We haven't picked a place. We've only said that we don't want a crowded one. He'll pick it. [ Car approching ] - Where's the money? - It's not here. - What the hell do you mean, it's not here? - We have to talk. - No. You need to give me my money. - It's not that we don't want to work something out with you. - Jerry, I told you, there's no debating this. - Five million dollars is unreasonable. - You know, maybe I didn't make myself clear. There's no negotiation about it. - We'll give you one million. - You'll give me five million. You'll give me five million dollars or you will spend the rest of your miserable lives in jail! - One million, take it or leave it. - You take a good look around. This is the last time you're going to see this much open space. - Yeah, well if we go to jail you go with us. - We'll say you're part of it. - You know, Jerry. You're swimming into deep waters, bud. - How are you going to explain to McBradden that you've known about this for weeks and didn't bring it to his attention? - Accounting has a record of your request of our expense accounts. Oh, and there's the photographs. - Unbelievable! You're setting me up?! - We are setting you up. - You couldn't set up a lawn chair, Jerry. - Oh, then there's the lobby surveillance tapes showing you and me going up to my apartment together yesterday. - I'm through. I'm done with this. I don't need that. - [Jerry's voice]: "You realize that once you get your share you're as guilty as we are. - [Schaeffer]: I know that. That's your guarantee. It's a little hard for me to go to McBradden or the cops to explain my involvement, so once I have the money, I'm gone. All right? You'll never see me again." It won't work. - Yes, it will. - No, it won't work because I never took any money. - Oh, but you did. I got your financial information from accounting this morning. - I've instructed my bank to wire one million dollars into your account at the end of the day. Talk about a paper trail. - You stupid...! - Now, there's still time to stop the transfer. I'll get you the money in a less conspicuous manner if you agree. [ Whap! ] Ooh! - You think you're going to turn this around on me? Is that what you think? Huh? I will kill you before I let you do that to me. Ugh! [ Thunk ] - No! No! No! [ Bang! ] - Arrg. - Oh my God. I had to do it. He was going to kill you. I had to do something. Oh my God. It was a million dollars, I offered him a million dollars, he didn't take it. I had to do it. He was going to kill you. - Jerry. We have to get rid of the body. - No, I can't, I... - Now listen to me! Calm down! Listen to me! Just a minute! Just breathe, stay with me, baby. Stay with me. Listen. Sit down here. Sit down, sit down, sit down. Shh. It's okay. Now... I have a blanket in my truck. I'm going to get the blanket. Do you hear me? And I'm going to wrap up the body and you need to go find a place, somewhere up there. Just go up there and find a spot, I'll wrap him up. Okay? Just calm down. Come on. Give me the gun. Come on. Okay. Okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. - Ah! [ Yelling ] - Okay... I cleaned out his pockets. We have to get rid of this stuff somewhere else. - All right. - Okay. [ Gasping ] My God!... [ Heavy breathing ] - Aaah! God! What the hell have I done? - [Rebecca]: I'll take my car. You take Schaeffer's. Okay? - Yeah. - I'm sure his address is in his wallet. We'll meet back at his house and leave his car there. Just be careful with your fingerprints. Jerry... you saved my life. We'll have to leave the country. Did you hear me? - Rebecca, I can't think about this right now. - Well, look: we can't just sit around, we need to have a plan. - Seems like our plans don't work out too well. - It's only a matter of time before they find the body. - So? - So? - So there's nothing to connect him to us. - What about the photographs? Don't you think, when they find the body, that the police are gonna search his house? What if the photographs are inside his house? - All right, okay. So... we'll go in, we'll find the photographs and the negatives. There won't be any connection. God! None of this had to happen, had he just taken the money! - I'm just glad we didn't transfer the money into his account. That would have been a real waste. What? - I just killed somebody. You're talking about saving money? - I'm just saying... after what's happened, I'm just happy we didn't give him a dime. Let's go. Jerry, Jerry, Jerry! I don't know about this. I don't know if we should go in. - We have to go in, we have no choice. - But... uh... Wait, wait, wait, wait. How do we know he lives alone, huh? Maybe someone's in there. Wait... Ah... - It's fine. - Jerry! What are you doing? Do you want the police to know that we've been here? Pick that up. Give me the keys. Jerry. - Aaah! Ah! - Here you go. Bingo! [ Sighing ] - What? - Jerry, we need to talk. - You know, Shannon, this really, really isn't a good time for me, okay? - You ever returned any of my phone calls. Didn't you get the envelope I sent you? - Envelope? - You know what I'm talking about. The support agreement. You promised to send me a check each month until the divorce is finalized. - That is what you came here for? - The mortgage is due, I've got bills to pay, and you won't return my phone calls! - I sent you the check. - I was supposed to have it a week ago. - Well, I am not responsible for the mail service, Shannon. - I can't pay my bills with promises, Jerry! - Well, what are you saying: I didn't send it? - No! I'm saying: I don't have it! I'm saying that you promised me something and once again-- - Oh! Will you shut up?!! I mean, you know what your problem is? That you are oblivious to other people's moods! I mean, have you noticed that I am just a little bit on edge here? No! You can't! Because it has always been about what you want whenever you want it, without any regard for anybody else! - What is happening to you, Jerry? - I'm just expressing my anger. - Are you taking your medication? - What? So suddenly, you care? Oh, of course, you care. 'Cause you need money! Everybody cares about Jerry now that he's got money. - It's not your money, Jerry. It's our money. Believe me, I earned it. - No... I earned it! I am the one who went to work every day for 10 years while you played with your cameras! I am the one who kissed ass for 10 years while you stayed home watching soap operas and reading magazines! So don't tell me you earned it, because you didn't. I did! - I don't know what's going on with you. But I do know I don't need this crap. I just want to get on with my life. I've been fair with you, Jerry, after everything you've done. I just want you to be the same. I'm going up to the lake on Monday to shoot some pictures after we sign the settlement papers. If you want to put a stop payment on the check you already sent, fine. But I want you to write me another one... right now so I can put it in the night deposit. - All right. Fine. - [Radio]: Today's weather calls for mostly cloudy skies throughout most of the day with a drop in temperature in the afternoon. It looks like more of the same for tomorrow. So all in all, not a great weekend weatherwise. And now for the CLXA news. Sheriff's deputies have reported finding a body buried in a shallow grave in the canyon this morning. They have yet to release the identity, pending notification of the family. In other news today, government-- [ He bangs on the counter. ] - Shoots! Ah! - Dr. Reilly's office. - Yeah, hi! This is Jerry Dennings. I am a patient of Dr. Reilly's. Could I speak to him please? - I'm sorry. Dr. Reilly is unavailable for the weekend. - What do you mean, he is unavailable? - He can't be reached. - This is kind of an emergency, so... - He's referring all his calls to Dr. Graham. - Yeah, but I don't want to speak to Dr. Graham. I want to speak to Dr. Reilly! - I'm sorry, sir. I have no way of contacting him. - Hmm!... - Hi! This is Rebecca. Leave a message and I'll call you back. - Meet me at the cabin. Noon. [ Sighing nervously ] Jeez! Where the hell are you? [ Phone ringing ] Hello. - Jerry, it's me. I'm outside. - I'm busy, Shannon. - Jerry, you forgot to sign the check you gave me. - Shannon, I said I'm busy. - I'm coming up. - Dammit! Ah! - You look horrible. - Thanks! - Jerry, I don't want to be a drag. I just want to get through this divorce as painlessly as possible. - Painless divorce. Isn't that an oxymoron? - I'm worried about you. - Ah! Why? 'Cause I lost my temper last night? - Have you spoken to Dr. Reilly lately? - I can't actually, he's unavailable. - I think you need to speak to somebody. Does he have a colleague? - Yeah. What? You think I should speak to him? - You've been under a lot of pressure the last few months. - Ha!... That is for sure. Well, okay, I'll speak to him, I'll speak to him. - Do you mean it? - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. First thing Monday morning. Look, uh... I'm going to get an iced tea, do you want one? - Do you have any soda? - No. - What have you got? - Iced tea! - Iced tea is fine. It's a nice place. One bedroom? - Two. Two bedrooms. One for me... and one... for me. Oh! Damn! - Make sure you get it all out. You'll have ants if you don't. Ha!... Look, I said everything I have to say. I know you have things to do. [ She walks out. ] - Bitch! - Jerry. - Where the hell were you? - What are you talking about? - Didn't you get my message? - Uh, no. I just got in. - What? You're on vacation, you don't check your messages? - I'm sorry, I got hung up. What's going on? - I needed you. - Jerry, I'm sorry. I should have checked. It was stupid. - I can't take this crap anymore. - Jerry, look... If I knew you needed me, I would have been there. I'm sorry. What's up? Hmm?... - When I got back from the lake, somebody put the blanket that we buried Schaeffer in, in my apartment. - What? - And... this came in this morning. - I don't understand. - Okay, I'll explain it to you. It's that Schaeffer wasn't acting alone. He had a partner who photographed the whole damn thing. It is my worst frickin' nightmare! - So what do we do, Jerry? What do we do? - We don't have the choice, we gotta go. - Go where? Where? - Mexico. We'll go to Mexico for now. - Okay. - So I want you to go to the lake tonight. And I'm going to go to the bank in the morning, I'll get the money and meet you there. - Okay. - Okay. - [Lawyer]: Apparently, your husband had the settlement agreement worded very artfully. By the terms of the contract, he was not awarded the money for damages prior to your separation. - Well, I don't understand. - The award for damages was based on future loss of earnings. The law states that once you are legally separated, your spouse is not entitled to share in any future earnings. - Are you telling me I'm not getting anything? - If you accept the offer, you'll get the house, half of all assets acquired prior to the separation, but none of the settlement money. - And he can get away with this? - We can fight it, but it's going to be very difficult to make a case against him. - Well, can't we say that he... separated from me to avoid his responsibilities? - We can say anything we want. Proving it is another matter. - No, no, no, no. That is not right. - The law is on his side. - And who's on my side? - Shannon, I understand how you feel. But-- - No you don't. You don't understand at all how I feel. - I only meant, I can understand how angry you are. - I am so tired of letting him screw up my life. That bastard... I won't let him get away with this. - All right then. I'll meet you at the end of the counter. - Thank you. [ He's out of breath. ] - You got it. - I got it. Our plane leaves at 4:00. - And where are we going? - Mexico City. We can disappear from there. Ha!... - I'm sorry it has to be this way, Jerry. - What are you doing? - Exactly what it looks like I'm doing. - I don't understand. - You weren't supposed to. - Oh no... You cannot do this. - I can. It's done. - No... - And don't go making this any more difficult than it needs to be. You're not a well man, Jerry. Something like this could just push you right over the edge. - Ah! - Ah! - I gave up everything for you. Everything, I killed for you! - Now what? - Now what? Well, I'm a man on the edge, remember? Why don't you give me one reason why I shouldn't blow your head off? [ Cocking a gun. ] - Well... 'cause then yours will be blown off. Drop the gun, Jerry. - I killed you. - I don't think so. - Well... I buried you. - Not me. It was Donald, the asshole. It was your buddy Donald. He was a clever kid, a little too clever. But in the end, he worked into the plan nicely. [Frank]: I want you to meet me during lunch tomorrow. I need you to do something for me. Yep! This looks like a good place. - For what? - [Rebecca]: No! [Whispering]: He's gone. - Why me? - Think about it, Jerry. If she filed a lawsuit, harassment against me, what would she get? I'm not married, I make $60,000 a year. You were perfect. You're married, house, career, stock options. Ha! Ha! Ha! - Rebecca... - Oh, Rebecca. You figured you got something special going on with her? Yeah... She's good at that, isn't she? - Don't worry, Jerry, we're not going to kill you. We're just going to leave you here without your car keys, put out the phones. By the time you get out, we'll be long gone. - So let's go, Jerry. Let's go, get on it. Get out of here! You know, you are a tougher nut to crack than we thought, Jerry. All we wanted you to do is to run so we can get to the money, uh? But you're a little stubborn, aren't you? Just stay there. - What if I want you to kill me? - Is that what you want? - Yeah, that's what I want! - This guy's nuts! - You tell me what I've got to live by. You want to go, then you've got to kill me. - Let's go, Frank, come on. - Now what?! You think you're just going to walk out of here, and that's the end of it? No. You've got to shoot me. Shoot me. Come on, shoot me! - Shoot him. - Yeah, come on, do it. The cops are going to find my dead body. You're gone, so is the money, and you two are going to be running for the rest of your lives. - Come on, Frank. Shoot him. - Ah! - Ah! - Frank! - Aaah! - [Rebecca]: Ah! - Aaah! - Ah! - Ah! - You bastard. - Ah! [ Gunshot ] - Ah! - Ah... Thank God, Shannon, you're here. Help me up. Shannon. Ah... Ah... - Miss Dennings, tell me again why you went up to the lake house. - I just wanted to get away for a while. - Have you ever met Miss Walker before? - No. - But you knew who she was. - Yes. - And you have no idea why she and Mr. Schaeffer went up there? - No. - You know, I don't think she knows anything more than she's telling. - We'll probably never know what happened. - I figure Walker felt wronged, so she talked Schaeffer into following Dennings up to the lake house for a little payback. Then it all went to crap. Look, I'm sorry we had to put you through that. - I understand. - Are you going to be okay? - Yeah. - It's a rough one. - Yeah. Can you imagine what's going on in her head? If she just crossed the room a few seconds faster, maybe she could have helped her husband up before he fell. Closed captioning: Technicolor, Creative Services - Montreal
