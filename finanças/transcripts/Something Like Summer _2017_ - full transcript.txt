Okay, by the way. Senor Langdon? Can I ask you... How is the Spanish "fagot"? Excuse me, sir? This is Spanish, 3rd year. Don't we have to learn more lingo this year? Yes, there are a few words about... There are a few words... that one can to use... to say... - meaning... - And what is its name... "mariposa" ("butterfly") It's called "Mariposa". Okay, now let's get started... I'm tired of chasing him every day. I just have to go and meet you. Watch out! Oh my God! Oh! Hell, you bastard! - Hold on, I'm coming down! - What's your problem? I am learning now. I am incomplete. - Tell me it's not broken. - I don't know, but maybe my ankle is. - You're bleeding, can you go? - Of course I can't help without help. - Okay, how do we do that? - Just grab me from behind and pick me up. I guess we have to jump to the nearest house and ask for transportation. - No, your house is across the street. - My house? Yes, well, let's go. - Is there anyone home? - My parents are away for a while. Why... Okay, I hold you, I hold you. - I'm fine, I'm fine. - You're bleeding. It must be cleaned. - I am fine. - Give me the keys. - You will not drive my car! - To ride with that foot? Give me the keys. Break my car and I'll kill you. Hole! Hole! - Change gear. - The gear? - Go to second. - What to do? Push the connector and then lever forward. - Who doesn't know how to change gears? - Gay men? Probably. - Do you know at least some brand of car? - Yes. Bentley, Bentley, but I don't know anything more about them. So, Benjamin, you know my name and my address. Ben, just Ben. I'll tell you Benjamin. You can't train at least one week. - And we need to call your parents. - We are friends... - roughly. - My parents are in Switzerland. Well, we have to call to your parents, which is... This is the boy who scares me. He is my best friend. - Ben Bentley. - Tell him Benjamin. I'll get my mother to call to his parents. That's great! The Fettucines Alfredo are almost ready. - I think they are enough. - Can you cook? Indian superpower! Hey, can you bring a pillow and my clothes from my room upstairs? Yes of course. Thanks. - Love this song. - Yes. You sound great! Try. I'll stop it. Maybe I should prepare the tub to change into clean clothes. - Want to help me with this? - Yes of course. - Are you sure? - Yes. - What did you say? - Nothing. Your bathtub is... ready. Cool. I'll call you later. Okay. I guess usually you don't spend your evenings so much. Rarely heterosexual, that are in the bath. You really are... What is it like to be gay? Like you. To be... - the way you are. - Hetero. It must be hard for you... I mean... with sex. Probably because of these difficulties. I came out into the light. - I understand... - Really? Sweet, you look good athlete with rich parents and a sports car understands what it's like to be me? Okay, I understand people are judging you. - You won't hear from me. - Sorry... - I know I shouldn't have... - No problem. Would it come to light again? Before... before I admit it... they invited me for a night's sleep. These guys knew... that I will not cause trouble, but when I came out into the light... they stopped. But I... I wanted... to mean something for someone. I couldn't do that, if I hide myself. And I did it anyway. And did that work? Not yet. Look, I have to go home. Maybe you'll feel lonely, I'll watch to rest a little and come back in the afternoon. - Really? Will you do it for me? - Yes, if you wish. I'll go... first... clean up a bit in front. - Look, Benjamin, I'm sorry... - Your clothes are on the bed... What is this observation for? To make sure you don't disappear again, like you've been doing all week. Have Alison? I'll take a shower. Make a note of it. Mom! - What are you doing? - Dear... you and I need to talk. - What? What you mean? - Alison? I told you, we're rehearsing that thing for the talent show. Yes, and Alison says you refuse to sing in front of an audience. You... talked to Alison? You go to gay bars. - I knew it. - What? - Honey... - Oh my gosh. I want you to read these and I want you to use these... I'm so shocked. How long preparing for this? I know your age is difficult. You're so lonely... but if you go... Oh my God, Mom, Mom I'm not walking gay bars, only one boy... - from school, his name is Tim. - Okay... No, it's not good. He is hetero. I hit him with my roller skates and I felt bad and was taking care of him. I take care of him. And so much. - Oh, you like him. - Oh my gosh. - You like it... - Mom, will you stop this... - Oh my God... - All right, invite him to dinner. - You give me condoms. - I want you to use them, honey, is it okay? - I love you. - I love you. - Hurry up.

Where did you get to with him. - I gave him condoms. - Are you serious? If I told you I was gay, you would not do it. I'm sorry, you're not a lesbian. You are not a lesbian. Jane, you said you drove a Ferrari yesterday. - Oh, really? - Ferrari! She saw you at the traffic light. - I can't drive that kind of car. - Is this your friend Tim's car? - Tim, what's the big problem? - Not a big problem. When Jane saw you was during school hours. Oh, Ben! Are you running out of school? - Mom's not like that... - Under Tim's influence, right? - Quite clearly... - You're lying, running away from school, Adam... - From now on, you are punished. From now on. - For what? - Without computer! - All right. And only at home!

You have many secrets. - This is fascinating! - Oh, i do not know... You have to be proud of that. It certainly should. You are amazing! Take her! - Really? - Yes. Really. I think too... that you have to sing in the talent show with Alison's group. - Yes? - Yes. I'll sing if you introduce me to their parents. - My parents are out of town. - Again? - Do they ever take you with them? - I do not interfere with them, neither do they. You are every teenager's dream. But I had to go to Mexico City, with my mother's family. How was it? Beautiful. Friends, who I met, they took me to the Popocatepetl volcano. - Popo... what? - Pop-cat-cock. It's a volcano. With that Spanish accent do you know the language well? Perfect. Then why do you study Spanish in school? Easy Six. - Oh, cheater. - Yes and what? Tell me something in... Spanish. - I'm not your trained puppy. - Come on, Tim. Something good. - Calling me a fagot is something nice? - What? - I'm not... - You were there that hour... Senor Langdon... - Yes. - Did I change? I laughed because Mr Langdon blushed like a virgin. "Mariposa" means "butterfly" sort of our "fairy", there is nothing offensive about this, - unless you take it out of context. - In Bryce's context, it's insulting. You can't be serious. Oh, hi, you must be Benjamin. Yes, ma'am, I came to pick up something from Tim... Hey, what's up, Benjamin. Ah, here's your notes. Thanks, uh... what's that smell. These are my mother's cheerleaders. They are great. Hey, Mom, can Benjamin stay for dinner? Oh, of course. Yes, of course, Benjamin. Dinner will be ready in 20 minutes. - Ready for that? - My homework is written. God bless us and this food in the name of our God Jesus Christ. Amen. - Tim keeps his friends a secret. - Mom! I'm just saying it's nice to be meet one of your friends. And so charming. Do you know his other friends? His boyfriend? Of course he knows Krista. Yes, she's really great. It is very popular. What about you, Benjamin? Which is your... beautiful girl. I have a boyfriend. It's very tasty. The food. If I can find a restaurant that offers so much delicious Mexican food, I'll eat there every day. They will make a fortune. Maybe you should to open such a restaurant, Mrs. Wyman. Oh, thank you, Benjamin. Hello. They don't want me to see you anymore. Yes, but you see me... Yes, but they don't let me to see you more. - I thought I liked them. - Yes, that's right, Benjamin. But they are also Catholic. Hey Tim, hello. - Is everything alright? - Give us a minute. Tim, maybe they just need it time to realize it. You will not fool them with your nonsense, how authentic my mother's food is. Okay, they won't see me again. I knew it would. So stupid. Everything will be as before... Oh, so, what if caught us together? - We'll figure out something if... - That's not funny. They will look at me different now. Why I invite a gay boy to dinner, instead of your girlfriend. - They will wonder. - Stop it. Tim, we can do that to work. Got it? We will be careful. - Oh, is that Tim? I want to congratulate him. - Oh, no, no, no, Mom... Then tell me what to do... Is this Khrista? His boyfriend. Oh, but I heard you... Do you think I'm deaf? Benjamin... Really? He was... I was sentimental. Come on, back. Go, go girl. Here we go. Away from them. - Hello. - Hello. - There is no one around. - Great. You're so sexy. - And a little pot. - You like me... Yeah, but... Aren't you tired of hiding, and not be like normal boyfriends? For my parents' sake, I told you. We do what we always do we did. Who do you like more, me or Krista? I like you more. Yes, but who are you sleeping with? Why with Krista? I sleep with you. Then drop it. Why do you need when do you have me? - You make it so hard. - It's even harder for me. The last birthday present. I broke up with her. Because of you. - Because of me? - Yes. I like you. And I want you. No matter what happens. The key to your home? No, it's not right. A romantic gesture, Benjamin. - Tell me something? - Yes? Is that right what you told me for the word "mariposa". Of course. Come on, say it again. This is not at all offensive. What does it mean? Means: Teach me to fly, my beautiful butterfly. - So I'm a butterfly... - Yes, yes. You are a beautiful butterfly. Oh my gosh! God, fire! To split! Run there! - Look what I found. - What? Where did you get it from? Bryce. He was there. He was watching us. - Bryce? - I ran into him, after we parted. - He started the fire. - What if the cops find us? If Bryce was there, we're screwed. - Tim, we're not... - Yeah, we're fucked. How could you do this to me? I have not done anything. I have not done anything. This is who we are. We, you, are one and the same. I am not like you! I have no parents who support me no matter what. I cannot live among the people who will laughing and pointing at me constantly. I'm not like you and never will be to be. I have to hide. You can't hide forever. Don't act like Bryce. He hates himself so much, that he hates the whole world. Fuck that. I can not. Do not touch me. I can't handle it. Ola, Mariposa! Seriously? Is this the best, what can you do? Stop it, look, Bryce, don't create problems right now. Oh no, you two "maripos" are the ones you have a problem. This means "butterfly". So much! You just say "butterfly". Senor Langdon, he made you a fool. In fact, it's pretty sweet, if you think about it. - What the hell, motherfucker? - Seriously? - The baby cried. - All right, everybody calm down. I will not calm down. That you saw us together, that's not what Bryce wants - Come on, come on. - Let's see how you do without a lighter. - Enough! - Give me the lighter! Fuck you! Let's make a deal. You're closing mouth for us and we remain silent for you. - Tim... - We're done, Benjamin. Everything is over.

He's dead, Ben. My father is dead. Please come. I need you. A funeral? Please? Are you traveling to a funeral? How do you know? Professional eye. Nobody looks sadder, when it comes to a funeral. Because it's the night before Christmas, and you're flying right now... not to mention the headache. Everything is clear to you huh? At the expense of the establishment. It will help you. Believe me, I have problems too with the headache. How did I do? Yes, I'm traveling to a funeral; I'm Jace, by the way. Your nameplate says Jason. Cruel bureaucracy. I told them to write to Jace, but they said I was confusing people. Where do these things come from? Any store? If they had told me, I would have been alone to buy it. I'm... I'm Ben. Bentley. If you were in our department, you would have Benjamin plate. - Yes, everyone calls me Ben. - Ben be. Only three letters. Very efficient. Uh... tell me how it happened, that you work at Christmas? That is my only duty is to serve people. And serve drinks. Where are you from, Ben. Chicago. Chicago... But... I'll be in Houston in two weeks. You know, we're forbidden because of company policy, let's invite meeting passengers. - Right. - Yes, that's right. I'm telling you. But I can invite anyone. You understand me... but I could help you, Benjamin. When Mom died... it was him very sad. He just started to go off. But the worst part is, and I realize it, that when I lost him too, I started to go out too. There is no. Do you remember what you told me, when we broke up with Tim and I was sad for months? - "Get over it!" - Exactly. Honey, I know you're sad now, but if you continue like that, it will hurt even more. I'm glad that you're here. Me too. Do not walk away. - You are here anyway. - Come to Austin with me. It's much more liberal there. You shouldn't be gay there to hide. As you do, though. - Are you sure about that? - Think about this. No more grumbling about the snow. A new beginning after the case of the one a Chicago loser. - Is not... - You'll be with your best friend again. We need to find an apartment. - Thanks, Ben. - Everything is fine, everything is fine. - I'll get the car. - Let's go. Hello? I happen to know that funerals are not made before New Year. Jace, hello. Thanks. Thanks for calling. So, when will you see me? Do I have the right to speak at all? I just don't believe in waiting. I also learned something about funerals. The hard way. Yes of course. Okay. Oh, God, that's not a good idea. - Hold on... - Oh, I'm getting up, I'm getting up... I have to skate alone. - Let's see if this is a great idea... - All right. I'll keep you light, until you take it alone I hold your hand. We may be in a bit of a hurry, if you get it. - How was high school? - It was not a very good experience. You couldn't come out?! Well, it wasn't me - him! It was great for a while. - Someone after him? - Of course. Homophobes, heterosexual... All the wrong choice. - Hello?! - Oh, well, well, well... Does not apply to attendees. Because I, on the other hand, I can pick them well. - Watch out. - The gremlin's lair. Oh, hello. Who is this? This is Samson or Sam in short. Hello. Oh, you mean hello? Say hello. May have passed his exam. - Now let's feed him. - I will not bother you. Biographies?! Creators, poets... Serial killers. Hitler. I've read this book too. - What a coincidence. - I like to read about people's lives. Oh, of those tiny bottles. Tiny bottles are very comfortable. It's good that you get all this stuff for free. No, it's not safe for free. Promise me the sheets and pillows will be from the airline. Let's drink about it... and a new friendship. Cheers. - Explain to me why you are still alone. - I'm not. I have Sam. He never leaves me alone. - I don't like loneliness. - Seriously. Steward. You're gone for days. You sleep every night n different bed. This does not inspire confidence in anyone boyfriend, a human being. I can handle it. To keep things... fresh... It's not so bad... Not for me. I wanted to tell you personally. - Sleeping pillows?! - They won't help you much. - You're driving me crazy. - Right? And how is morning #3? So I never want to leave. Then... why don't we make it official. Given, let's become "officially" boyfriends. You're cute. I don't know if I do I'm a boyfriend material. Why don't you let me judge. I'm older and smarter, remember? That's what you say. It was easy for you. Because I'm a steward? Maybe this restrains you? Will you fly to Austin? No way. I'm thinking of transferring there next semester. It even scares me a little. You tell me this move will I be startled and run away? Why? Do what you have to do. We will invent something. Got it? God, you're great. - Because of the exams? - They are today. Hi, woman You are forbidden to rejoice, when I'm so sad. Then you need a drink, if so. - I'm sick of listening to you... - She needs that... - Hello?! "She" is right here. - And the weekend is set... Will you join us? You have no exclusive rights this weekend. He is waiting this weekend, so come on! Blowing it... dear. Yes, I'll blow it! - Hi, Anthony. - Hi, Vako. Vako is wrong because his boyfriend is not here. I wanted to call you last night, but that's it turned into a nightmarish night. You had to work, as I understand. No, but my sister is out of town and I had to take care of Sam. - Yes, you've been terribly busy. - Come on, you love Sam. But I also love my boyfriend, which I have not seen in a month. - Let me explain... - We'll talk later, okay? What? Damn it. It was rough. Didn't you have to drink beer somewhere? Do not worry. I'll call you later. Well, sure enough ruin my surprise, huh? - I'm such an idiot. - Fortunately, I'm the best boy in the world. Wait! Does this surprise mean... - what I want? - Oh, I'm here, aren't I? This is technically no surprise, because you friend always surprise me. I'm moving to Austin. Which means I moved to Austin. I have an apartment in Clarksville. - And you were going to tell me when? - Today, before you hang up my phone. - Yes, I'm sorry. - And after he apologized... - I have one last surprised. - Oh, I don't deserve this... No, you don't deserve it, but I love you anyway. Paris. During Christmas break. - I was so bad with you... - Yes, it was. So you owe me a favor. Whatever. I'll choose when. For whatever it is. - Here we are. - Here? Does this "duck" mean? - Fox. - Mmmm, go. - Welcome, gentlemen. - Thanks. - This one? - Yes, especially for us. Did he say Texas? I think in French that means that I want my promise right now. - What? - Are you scared? I'm sorry. Are you okay? One year later Honestly Tim, you have to move from Jace, officially. I have a great roommate, I only have two months left, before for a taste of the real world. Exactly. Jace is your real world. You are, anyway, constantly together. I am only... - interfering roommate. - Is that important? - What? - Yes, the real world. Do not interrupt me... - What is tight? - Oh, God, don't turn! Benjamin! - I... Are you really? - Yes... Are you visiting? - I study here. - I thought you were in Chicago. I have to go. Benjamin, wait! - What do you want? - I don't know, let's talk, I guess. I can not. Look, I know you're mad at me. I'll get out of your way, but... Here, take this. I'll call you one in the evening and we can... communicate a little. - How do you know I'm not going to throw it away? - I'm leaving now. Wait. On one condition. Your sketchbook. Let me look at it. He was right, Benjamin. For which? For many things. Give me back the sketch later. Your standard is standard! Last year we were in one class in chemistry. It took him a lot to recognize me. And then what? Tim, he asked about you... where are you, how do you drive her... And you said... I told him I'm in Chicago, but I didn't met a year after that. What should he do if he calls? Think of Jace. Oh my God. Not like having sex on the phone with him. What? - What? - I... I think... that he has something, for example like a little uncle. No no no. No! - What exactly do you mean? - Someone older and flush with money. Luxury. Probably bidding money. Do you think a guy with his ass, will hang with a rich old man, just because of his personality? - Hello? - How is it? Okay... uh... thank you. Thanks for picking me up. Where are you? - I... had... - No. No, Tim. I mean, where was he? Lord, five years is a long time, huh? Yes, something like that. Look, I'll answer every question, who you want. With you. Come on, face to face. I do not think so. Why? Aren't you dressed? You lie in your bed alone shorts. Benjamin Bentley, did you train? God, what the... What are you doing here? How did you find me? I found Alison in the phone book. Come on! Don't relax. Come in. Does that mean I can't to start getting to know you? It is not a good idea. Come with me for dinner. I'm not going anywhere before I get it some answers. Okay. Five years ago... I went to Garrose for a year... to run away from you... from Bryce... by all. And by myself, including. - Are you heterosexual in Austin? - Not exactly hetero. It's easier to be gay here. Wait. Are you gay now? Just sleeping with some guys to navigate, but yes. And your parents? They are no longer in my life. What about you? Chicago was just... was it a lie? Keep me away? No. I was there the first year. Daddy? This is Jace. We are together for a year and a half. I guess I deserve it. I was thinking of seducing you tonight. I told myself I would do anything to bring you back. - Now I'm kind of... ashamed. - Tim... Tim, I... I'm glad to see you again... but I'm afraid of you. This is new territory for me. So... you want me to drive it slow. Okay. We'll drive it slow. Until recently. Okay, Ali knew all the time, that Tim was studying here and she said nothing. Maybe she just tried to protect you. - I'm a big boy. - How would I know. I called him to return his sketchbook. So... so you're planning should I meet Tim? I hope so. I told him you weren't at work today. Okay. I just think it's important he should look at the two of us as a couple. Are you jealous, Jace Holdon? Speaking of now, I also had a similar problem. Lets hear. Uh... about 6 months ago... on the flight to Boston, she was nervous a traveler named Erin. It was... sweet... a younger boy... but he was terrible and had to hold his hand throughout the flight. I don't think I know him. Well, when we landed, he invited me get me a drink. - And you... you... are gone. - Almost... Even when I mentioned you, he was still trying to kiss me. And he was really sexy, I won't lie... I definitely wanted it, but... I made my choice, that I want you And didn't you? I didn't. But part of me wanted it. And you can to try to understand me. I'm just old-fashioned. And I only want you. And I believe you. Delivery. Pizza! You have to be Jace?! - And you're probably Mister Abercombie. - I'm Tim. Nice to meet you. Tim! What a surprise! Hey, I decided we could all be friends... with pizza. Or Thai food? God! This is Italian! - Italian! - Italian! - Look at this place! - That's good, isn't it? He took my crutches and left me on the beach with those girls. Who are the girls? Those you flirt with? Yes, but someone else helped me, after escaping. - I don't want to remember that. - Some welding happened there. Benjamin! A gay man who doesn't understand about cars, just hit the jackpot! I heard you do too. I understand what you're really asking. His name is Eric. He was a friend. He died last year and bequeaths everything to me. I'm sorry. But it's a little unusual... to inherit so much money... by a friend, I mean. - Right? - Yes. Unless he was your uncle or something like that... So... Alison told you all the gossip. Eric was old, rich and gay and I should to be his toy boy? I don't know, Tim. This is nonsense. Eric was a good person and also the best a friend I once had. - Didn't he try to do something. - Oh, try. But I don't, however. Did he want to? Sometimes you can't tell a friend, that you love him. I want to tell a friend like him. And like you, Benjamin. And now I want to be a friend with both of you. If you give me a chance. Sorry, Tim's out of town, and Benjamin teaches. And when they're out of town I want... Tim and Jace get along well. No, it's not. Okay, fine, I promise, lunch on Sunday. I will come. I love you. I have to close. I have to close! Are you Jace's roommate or something like that? No, I'm his boyfriend. Yes, great! Believe it yourself. Look to get my note. Hey, are you ready for dinner? - They left you a note. - A note? Read it! Benji, is that a joke? You didn't expect to see me that soon. My parents reached out for a ticket. - Where was last week? In Boston? - Yes and what? You think it's... No! This kid didn't write it. I haven't even seen it since. Since when? How about: "What did we do in this hotel room! It still hurts my ass.". - "With love, Erin". - Nothing has happened. It is... I don't even know what that is. I'm not a fool, Jace. I've never cheated on you. What is this? - Tim. - Oh, tight Jace! I saw the kid at our door. I'm damn sure that it wasn't Tim. I don't know what's going on, but if anyone is under suspicion, it's you. I was completely honest about mine friendship with Tim Friendship? Are you kidding? I see the way looks at you when I'm right there. - Asking you to give him a chance... - I get the whole picture, okay? I trust you Ben, I don't blame you... Benjamin! I think he's cheating on me. Do you have anything to do with it? What? No! What happened? I was hurt, that's what I'm saying. He was there in front of the apartment and... leave a note, Jace denies I do not know either... I don’t know what is going on... Everything is fine. I'll get a beer and you will tell me what happened. - I'll take off your pants... - Well dear. - I don't want you to sleep with your jeans. - Mmm... The Japanese used it as a torture. I'll always be there for you, Benjamin. You're awesome. He was faint. I'm sorry I blamed you. Are you calm now? Well well. Hey. I'm just a friend, who supports you. Remember? We'll put you to bed... Echo? Tim? You're not a gay pursuer, you know this. Hello. I was... uh... I would... If I want something from you is to you practice honesty. You've been busy. Eric? Yes. He is... He is... beautiful. Hey what are you doing? Stop it, stop it, stop it... I slept with Tim. I knew it! As soon as he told me, that you will pay, I realized you did something stupid. - "Stupid" is too much. - How about: "Have you lost your mind?!". - Better "stupid". - I do not understand. What about Jace? I do not know. He's in Chicago. Do you still love him? - Yes of course... - You have to deal with him. and put a distance between you and your past. Tim is not my past. Yeah he hurt me before, but... I love it. And it's probably stupid... I can't explain why, but... I love it. Yes, but you can't have both. If Ronnie Adams walks in the door now, my heart will leap. But we have a chance, right? Life went on. Except for Tim. It's different for me. Excuse. See. You and the rest of the world you see the spoiled, arrogant athlete. I see the boy whose parents they were giving him trouble, they didn't realize how talented he was, he is brilliant who showed me that he needs me. Yeah, I know Jace loves me and stuff, but... we are still together... he was fine when we met, he will be fine also if we break. Flat. Flat. Ben... Ben. Everything will be fine, Allison. - Do you go to school here? - Leave me alone! You're not from the countryside. You study here. I get out of here. You guys decide threesome problem. - Benjamin, wait? - Enough lies, Tim. I was stupid enough to believe you. And now, I lost the Jays. I told you I would do anything to bring you back. - You wanted to believe. - No! You wanted this relation... No, I had to realize he never did will not fall for someone like this! Why would you think that? Because of you! What's wrong with us? My life is so fucked up when you show up. - What else is left between us? - A lot. Trust me. You're a damn coward. Congratulations! It's for your own good. Talk about it. I'm going to the party. Congratulations, Ben. I want you in my life, Ben. - I can not... - I need you. I slept with Tim. No... You... sometimes you do things... You have to hate me. No... Look, that would be very easy. I had enough faith that we would fix it things between us before you run to Tim's bed. I've always admired... of your courage to go out in the 9th grade light. Seriously. But when it comes to proving, who are you really... it turns out that was the last one a real risk you took. So much, you were so scared of... everything. I'll do it. Excuse me... - Ben, what are you doing here? - I need to talk to you. Even if I have to travel all the way to Chicago to do it. Hi Jace.

I love you. Ben, I loved Jace, but it's been years and your life is not over. I... I don't want to go forward. The last thing Jace would want is to stay in one place in his memory. No... Sorry, I disagree. Is this something included? Sorry, it was so high. Lord, thank you so much to see you all here tonight. I'm pretty clumsy in speeches, so be understanding. The works on display tonight are the result of 20 years of work. I think you've seen "my great" artwork: Frog floats in a boat. I painted it when I was 8 years old and I think they understand why I keep it something for such a long time. I owe my creativity to many people. Of models, of course, Executor Eric Canroy, which meant a lot to me. He was my father, idol and just... so much more. And many people, in fact, have inspired me, but... only one kicked me in the ass. And he did it hard, and... gave me the courage to earn his art in light and put it here. I want to note that he actually is is here tonight. And I would end this weird speech, thanking him publicly. Benjamin Bentley. Honestly, everything is true very, very complicated. I know.
