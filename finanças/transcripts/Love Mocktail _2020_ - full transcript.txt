Aadi keeps talking about you... Reema was like that... Reema was like this... Really? Is he still not over me? When did i always speak about her? I only told about her once, Ahh.. you know what? When he came to propose me, it's a long story! Reema, is it required now? why all that now? Aadi... Atleast ask her to sit she is insulting me while standing itself... Should i make her sit and get more insulted? I have to leave now, It was great meeting you guys. I will tell you the full story, next when we meet. You all take care.. Silly fellow!! Bye.. Bye.. She was like a flower... Now she has turned into Cauliflower! I had told you then, she doesn't look like Titanic heroine You never listened to me. Hey!!! You were calling her Ash!! Look at her face properly. I was happy that i got promotion, And also i was going to be a father! Life was perfect! But This work, career all these things Just took me far away from myself... Hello. why no calls? I will call you back. Okie. I told Nidhi to quit her job to take rest. But it made her restless. Hi!! What happened to my Nidhi? Why did my bird get into the nest? You shouldn't get upset for everything. Nidhi... Come here. Nidhima did you come? If you love me... you will be here before i count 3. Forget it, If you don't love me... What will i do with this panipuri? I will put it in dust bin! She is like a maruthi car... Maintenance free It's tough to convince wife even with a diamond necklace... But i would get the work done, with just 25Rs panipuri! I am lucky to get a wife like her! You always say, you are bored at home. Shall i open a panipuri shop for you? Hmm super idea!!! You too quit your job... You keep making it for me, And i will keep eating it. I somehow convinced her that day. And i decided not to repeat it next time But Nothing worked... Aadi... Manager is calling you. Ya i will come. I just forgot what's important and what i should prioritise Oh, 20 missed calls!! Nidhima... What happened? Did anyone say anything to you? Who is here to say anything? I had too much of work in office. Before we were just 2 of us... Now we are going to be 3... To own a house, A car... And a good lifestyle I have to work right? If you work you will get money But your presence is not here If you are not here... What will i do with the money? I don't want... The money you earn... I want the time you give me I don't know if we will be there tomorrow, But i want you to be with me for today, Will you be there? I am hungry I always treated Nidhi like a kid, But what she told... Was so true. I thought, whatever i was doing was for our future, But she made me realise... That i wasn't there in it To keep our loved one's happy. We work hard But the real happiness lies in... In those wonderful moments we spend. Why are you taking such decision Mr Aditya? Think about it... Who will say no to promotion? This is for your future. I have taken this decision for my future, Just a minute, Hello Hi Sushma, Where are you guys? I have come out with Vijay, I am all ready, What's the surprise? Surprise?

Sorry..Sorry.. Sorry..Sorry.. Sorry sweetheart... Happy birthday... Leave my hand. Didn't i surprise you in the mid night... On your birthday? Hmm.. You enjoyed so much then... Why can't you surprise me? What can i surprise you at this time? It was during this time... You went to surprise her, And sat the whole night in Mysore footpath! Ohh... Did you lose interest after marriage? All you men are the same! It's not like that Nidhima... Hey get lost.. Ahh? Get lost? Are you crying? Sorry I kicked you. Wow you are so romantic! You both make a very good pair. After seeing you both I too want to get married soon! Actually. I have started liking Nidhi now I want to meet her once. Which baby did you have? Is it a boy or a girl? Can i guess this one? Please? Aadi? Aadi? Why did you become silent? Are you her husband? Yes, What happened? It's a miscarriage. Ahh? How is she? She is fine, You can go and see her. Nidhima... Sorry... Why are you asking me sorry? You shouldn't cry. Sir, Doctor is calling you. I will speak to the doctor and come, You rest. How are you related to the patient? I am her husband Why? What happened? Any problem? We got blood sample reports, HCG levels are very high. If it's too high, Then there might be presence of malignant cells. Any serious issues? I can't confirm you right now. You do one thing, Get PET scan And these tests done. Once i get the reports, I will tell your wife's exact condition. Doctor, what has happened to me? The reason for your miscarriage is.. You have ovarian cancer! It's in stage 3 Cancer? It's just not possible... Something must be wrong with the report. How can she have cancer? See her, she is so healthy. So what if she has got cancer? It's so common these days. It can be cured right? Nothing to worry, If it's in stage 1,2 and 3 It can be cured. There are treatments... Let's start treating from today. Yes of course, We have to do chemotherapy and radiation therapy For which, you have to be mentally strong. She is very strong doctor, Infact we both will fight together. Very good, Don't worry, i will be there with you. Nidhima... Nidhi? Nidhima... Nidhima... What happened? Doctor has already told us There will be hair loss. I love my hair. Why is it happening to me? Will i be fine again? 100 percent you will be fine... Still, i won't look nice without my hair Who told you? My Nidhima is pretty however she is. I don't look good even with my hair, No, You are look good. Cancer cells have spread to other organs. It's in the last stage. Sorry to say this, No further treatment will help. We can give pain killers to reduce the pain. Can we somehow... Save her? What are you doing? Doctor just told me, She will be fine in a week. Sushma, You take a week off. We all will go on a trip. Viju, Select a good place to go. Nidhima come... You know what, Doctor couldn't believe That you are recovering so fast. You are the only patient to recover so soon. To whom should all this credit go to? I have taken care of her like a princess. Nidhima... You want some water? Hey... What are you guys doing here? Aren't you late to office? leave now We will meet tomorrow, come. Don't forget to book the tickets. Aadi.. Hmm? I know, i won't live long, Who told you? It's written on your face. What's written? You are feeling comfortable right? Those medicines are keeping me comfortable. It's just temporary. I am sorry Aadi. Why are you asking me sorry? I dreamt of having kids, grandchildren, And that we grow old together. And now i am leaving you halfway How much time is left? If i look at you, I don't think i have much time. Can you fulfill my word? Just sleep for a while. Can you take me home, please? You wanted to meet Nidhi right? Here she is... Hi Nidhima... Look who is here. How are you? I have brought your Xerox. Even she is like you... Talks very less... Say hi. She can't hear you... Open your mouth and say. Hi... What are looking at? Why don't i have tears in my eyes? She was the one who taught me what true love and happiness is. If i cry infront of her, she won't like it. Look, She left me alone And happily settled there. Aadi.. Hmm? My nature, My hairstyle Everything is similar to Nidhi right? Hmm.. That's why you saved me, You dropped me, And spoke so much with me... Hmm. Life is still a long journey... Can you again... Love someone? Everytime i was in love, i felt, it was true love. When everytime it failed, I looked for a new love. Nidhi might not be there with me, But i never felt, her love is dead or a failure. Because true love happens only once in a life time, And it already happened to me That's enough for this life time. It was nice meeting you Aadi. Bye.. Aadi.. Hmm.. This was my best journey. Your friends were right Time just flies, if you are along Bye..
