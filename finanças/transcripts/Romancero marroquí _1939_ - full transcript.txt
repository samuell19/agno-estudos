Restored 2001 by Filmoteca Española from nitrate negatives of the German version from the Bundesfilmarchiv and from negatives of the Spanish version from the General Library and Archive of Tetouan, Morocco. The restauration was supported financially by the EU's Lumière Project Media Program. MOROCCAN BALLADS This film was shot in the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, through the initiative of the High Commissioner with our thoughts focused on Franco, and with the enthusiastic support of all Moroccans. Since the beginning of our glorious movement, united by a common ideal, the noble Moroccan People have stood by National Spain, heart and soul. This film, made with profound respect for our Muslim brothers, aspires to be a tribute of admiration to their virtues and a testimony of gratitude of their generous loyalty. Moroccans are like the film's hero: Noble, unassuming, valiant, and pure, volunteers for Spain from the very start on own free will, as if obeying some ancestral impulse. Thus, voluntarily and with heroic vigor, the people of Morocco took part in our Holy Crusade. Let the blood ties that unite our two peoples blossom for both and bring forth a luminous future. The voice of the mujahedin, reaching valleys and mountains the skies and the sea, has called for prayers and life. Morocco wakes, the day has begun, and light floods the fields. This is the Good Year rite. With the first ride of the plowshare a piece of bread is planted in the soil as a symbol and charm, so it may return as golden wheat ears. While her husband plows the earth and her son tends the flock, Fatima, a hard-working Moorish woman, makes sure the home lacks nothing. The concert is over. There is no power and force but God's. "Father, I'm leaving." "It's your decision, son. May God guide you." "Farewell. Safe travels and may God protect you." Like every year at this time, when farming is over El Alami ventures out looking for work. Like a migrant swallow, through fields and forests, settlements and souks, sure of his path because he knows that God's will guides him. The mosque marks a stop on his way. Prayer belongs to the most important duties of any good Muslim. It's souk day. People travel great distances to buy and sell and to catch up and chat. How lively is the souk! So full of life! It lacks nothing. From tasty fruits to the choicest of fabrics. For all tastes and for all budgets. Delivering water all day, beckoning the thirsty with his small bell. The Moor water carrier does not get paid. If someone rewards him, so much the better. No cajolery! This donkey is as old as the hills! How beautiful and big is the city of Alcazar (Ksar El-Kebir). How delighted is El Alami wandering the streets, admiring the shops and greeting old acquaintances. Night falls, but closeby some nomad's haima (tents) can be seen. El Alami asked for hospitality in the name of the Lord, and the nomad of the haima replied: "You are welcome, shall you accept it." "Let's eat, in the name of God." "Everybody up! Come on!" The restless nomads are moving again in search of new pastures and horizons. Be it in the Kholot plains near the Atlantic beaches or the Rif plateaus, in front of the Mediterranean. At the foot of the Tiztoutine hill, in the main 'haima' of the Rif nomads, there is a celebration. This is the only dance in all Morocco where men and women dance together. "The war broke out in Spain" the soldier said to El Alami. El Alami answered "May the peace be with us." News from Spain. Many things have occurred. "We'll stay with Franco and his friends." Cedars of Ketama! Yellow plains! Immortal cradle of the Saviour Movement of Spain! Franco! 17 July - 18 July. Long live Spain!! Onwards Spain! Spaniards! The dismay of the majority of Spaniards at the disappearance of our common ideal has once again been heard by the army and by other forces of the nation who are now united by a shared vision of Spain. Spain! Can we tolerate the shameful spectacle we offer to the world another day? Can we abandon Spain to the enemy of the motherland, act cowardly and treacherously, surrender without fight or resistance? Never! Perhaps the traitors would! But never us who swore to protect her. Spaniards! You who love Spain! All of you, who, in army and navy profess your faith in the service of your country. To all of you who swore to protect her from enemies even with of your lives! The nation calls on you to defend it! El Alami's path in these past few days has filled with rumours and visions of war. El Alami now understands the struggle in Spain, the colors of Franco's flag. Secret impulses guide his course onto other paths and command his heart. My Lord, give me a safe journey. This is Tetouan, the 'White One'. Bewitched by the moon. Air filled with the bubbling of her fountains and her songs, flapping of doves and scent of orange blossom like a pure and prudent bride. Moorish Tetouan, pearl of the land, the most beautiful, daubed in snow-like orange blossoms, rose bush in bloom. But also bustling and cheerful, dynamic and lively, keen on modernity, open to the world's developments without losing her original grace. The devout men come to pray at rural 'Moravo' shrines and in Tetouan's glorious mosques. The voice of the mujahedin calls the believers from tall minarets. Today is an auspicious day. His Imperial Highness Caliph Moulay Hassan his ministers - foremost the venerable Grand Vizier - and the high dignitaries of his court shall pray among his people. They await on the streets, eager to express their loyalty and affection for the beloved Sovereign. Every day there's are more volunteers for Spain. El Alami is one of them. Safe in the knowledge he's fighting for Franco's Spain, for his own country and for a just cause in God's eyes. For all Spain. For the Spanish Morocco with the same fevour and conviction. Veritable human torrents come on their free will to enlist. Not driven by motto or propaganda. Volunteers following pure hearts. Kabyles with each other. Who can bring more men? From the plains and the mountains. From Yebala and from Gomara. From the coast and from inland. And from the Rif from and the West. Chauoen, holy and mysterious city built by Andalusian Moors, as though brought to the Maghreb from Ronda or Aracena's mountain range. Where every orchards is a garden, every garden a palace. Where springs chant like mockingbirds and black birds. Chauoen's men heed the calling in their blood for the land of their forefathers. Brave Yebries! Courageous Gomaris! Indomitable Rif People! All together! With heroic impulse for Franco and Spain. Spain! Her kid is ill and Fatima goes to the souk to buy medicine. The medicine Fatima bought at the souk doesn't help much. That's why she seeks the nearest medical practice so the Spanish doctor can heal her child. He'll heal him at once or very soon, Fatima is confident. The teacher of Tetouan's vocational school, one of the best, with pupils. The protectorate's industrial effort grows in strength from day to day. While there's fighting on Spanish soil Morocco doubles its own efforts. The river mines and its metals, one of the most richest in the world. The latest mining methods are employed and contribute efficiently to victory. Oh, noble Moorish craftsmen of ancient traditions. Proud of your art, masters of many villages Owners of your destinies, unshakable in your positions like your brothers in trenches in Spain. These girls from Chaouen weave rugs as though they were fairies. Here are the famous pipers from Yayuca celebrated all over Morocco. Wherever there is a celebration you will can find them. The bustle of their flutes and drums, and the grace of their dancers. Tetouan, like all of Moroocco, celebrates Maw-lid, the holy commemoration of the Prophet's birth. Brotherhoods with flags and musician parade streets bursting with joy. This caged Red fellow will be 'whitened' for the rest of his life. On horseback or on foot, upending guns is the holiday's favourite pastime. For the Maw-lid celebrations the Spanish authorities donate a 'Moravo' shrine near the suburbs of Alcazar's. The brotherhoods lead the sacrificial cattle straight to the saint's mosque. Guard! In formation! His Excellence, the High Commissioner in Morocco, addresses the court of His Imperial Highness The Caliph, and the military and civil authorities in the Protectorate's capital to wish him Happy Maw-lid. On behalf of the Chief of State, the Government of New Spain, civil servants and administrators of the protectorate and in my own name, Your Highness, it is my exquisite honor to salute you on this Sacred Holiday of Maw-lid and my ineffable satisfaction to convey once again what all of Spain feels for the noble people you represent. You, who take pride in having been chosen thusly, you who place your trust in the Generalissimo's Spain. Trust, forged on an anvil of struggle, made up of loyal men, heads held high, true to the Caudillo's promise like roses of peace that shall flourish, watered with blood generously spilled by two people united by but one ideal. Sir, I pray the Almighty shall grant you a long and prosperous life and Islam its rightful place in the world, earned by virtue of its history. With noble, caring words for Spain and her Caudillo, his Imperial Highness the Caliphate repays the greetings and conveys his hopes for Spain's victory. Tetouan's best horsemen are about to discharge their rifles in honour of the Caliph and the Spanish Envoy. Arrival of Colonel of Staff, Don Juan Beigbeder, High Commissioner of Spain and greeted by dignitaries of Tetouan. The High Commissioner heartily greets the Grand Vizier. The High Commissioner and the Grand Vizier greet His Highness The Caliph. Fatima arrives to receive the 'muna', a payment sent by her husband. The city of Larache, beautiful sultan of Roman, Moorish and Spanish riches. Bathed in the Atlantic, witness of old to Columbus' ships on her beaches. "Tell my husband we're well. I merely long for his beloved face." "Tell him also I got the 'muna'. In Ceuta, Spain's Moroccan pearl, each boat from home is a welcome sight. Another man appears, Alami the Brave, with his sergeant's stripes, his three injuries and a medal on his chest. "Come. Let's go see your son." "I bring a gift from beautiful Spain." "What a precious necklace." "I got something for you, too." El Alami returns from Spain for joyful harvest days. His friends help pick the corn from his fields. Mountains and landscapes of the Wild Rif, land of indomitable people, brave and noble, gracious and simple, with strong muscles and burning hearts. Fraternal friends of Spain. At the well water is a minor concern. A delicious little chat with the girlfriends by a Rifian well. The soil is poor but Rifians work hard. With help from Spain these Rifian lands shall soon bring forth abundant fruit with less human toil. In blue water the rock of Alhucemas stands tall like a battleship. Fishermen from four towers, hot-blooded adventurers. Once proud owners of the Berber coast, today as daring as their ancestors. A women's souk in the river. Men are strictly banned from entering this souk. Still, the odd Spanish emissary manages to squeeze through. The women forgive the faux-pas gladly as he brings word from the trenches, news they will help spread from souk to souk and from village to village. Never has there been as much money, or as much desire to spend it. Despite the war they want for nothing. Nationalist Spain is governed well and administrated efficiently, and Morocco is its true mirror image. Hence, there is always joy and life in the souks. The harvest over, the joy still lingers. It's the time for weddings. A big wedding is being prepared in Izemmouren, near Ajdir and Villa Sanjurjo, opposite Alhucemas. The celebrations last several days. The invited arrive from near and far. For the duration of the festivities they are guests of the bride's father. The bride prayed at a nearby shrine. Veiled from head to toe she hastens home with her friends. The musicians, the best in the region, have been hired for the wedding. Whenever gift-giving guests arrive the musicians receive them outside. The dances last from dusk to dawn for 5 or 6 days, just like the wedding. The war goes on in Spain, but Morocco stays by her side, keenly eager. The Moroccan people work closely with the Spanish authorities. Spain's High Commissioner travels far and wide in the Zone and is always welcomed with deep respect and heartfelt cheering. The Moroccan people rejoice in our victories as if they were their own. The streets of Melilla bursting with joy. Cadets from the Rif Mountains and from Tawima (Nador), glorious (human) quarries to resupply the Spanish infantry. Provisional sub-lieutenants in Franco's army and your heroic deeds! Immortal pride in Spain's glory! Here are the Naval Arrows of Melilla, flower of the Spanish Falange. Boys with heart and soul of men. They are Spain's future. Spain on the move. Imperial Spain of tomorrow. Present... arms! Shoulder... arms! Present... arms! Load weapons! Present... arms! Rest... arms! Ground knee! Attention! Rest arms! Half turn! Shoulder arms! Left... right! Left... right! Assume positions! Prepare to fire! Remove charger! Remove! Planes overhead! (Falangist anthem) "I'll take my place alongside my companions" "who stand on guard in the heavens," "with a hard countenance," "they are alive in our effort." "If they tell you that I fell," "know that I went to my post up there." "Victorious flags will return" "at the cheerful step of peace" "and they'll bring five roses" "on the arrows of my quiver." "Spring will laugh again," "which we await by air, land and sea." "Onwards, squadrons, to victory," "that a new day dawns on Spain!" "Spain united!" "Spain (the) great!" "Spain (the) free!" "Onwards Spain! Onwards!"
