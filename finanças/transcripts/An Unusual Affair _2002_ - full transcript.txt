Emma! Come here! Come here. Everything alright? Nice Party. Good. Hey, are you having fun? She?s grown so fast. Time flies, doesn?t it? Yes. Papa, come on, join us! No, I can?t dance. She?ll teach you. No, no, I have duties. Papa! No. Ah! Mr Leutner! How nice of you to come! Good day! Good day! For you. Thank you. I?m a bit late. Oh, that?s fine, as long as you?re here. Come on, I?ll introduce you to some people. Katja! Tom Leutner. That?s Katja Schmidt, our colleague for english and german. Hi. Bio and Physics. Yes, I heard that already. Well, I?m gonna introduce you to my husband and then I?ll leave you alone. Excuse me. Jochen? That?s Tom Leutner, our new colleague. That?s my husband, Jochen Wenzel. He teaches one of the classes that you?re gonna take over. Hm. Wine, Beer, Water, Coffee? Coffee, please. Good. Hello. You don?t look like a teacher. Well, neither do you. That was a compliment. I mean you?re so young. It?s just how I look. Papa, where?s the ball, I can?t find it. Wait, I?m gonna help you. Oh, I didn?t look there. Thank you! Hep! Thank you. An unusual affair Eh Mama, where?s my grey Tshirt? What TShirt? The one with the X on the front. In the washing machine. Why is it in the washing machine? Anything that?s in the basket will be washed. And I haven?t put it in the basket. Allright. Shit! Ciao! Hey! Take care. Hm. And don?t forget the helmet! Why did you go to bed so early yesterday? I was tired. We?re having a party and first you go running and then you?re tired. Why isn?t Emma down yet? Emma! How I hate this dawdling. She won?t have time to eat again. Emma, we have to go! Suddenly you were gone. What am I supposed to tell everyone? Should I tell them, Jochen hates having guests? I mean I understand that you don?t like parties but you promised to be there. Mama, why you?re always calling for me? Why do you never call Phillip? In contrast to you he doesn?t need me reminding him of the time. And we talked about wearing makeup in school. Mama, please Emma, no! Papa, why don?t you say something? You are so mean. We won?t debate that now. We?re late, come on. Come on, darling. I am no darling. Oh right, I forgot. Do you still come? Here. Yuck. Do you have another one? All the giris wear makeup, why can?t I? That?s not true, Emma, only two are allowed makeup. Still. Just because you wanna become headmistress. Now stop it, Emma, it?s got nothing to do with my job. Even if I stayed at home, I wouldn?t allow you. Period. Period. I am sorry because of yesterday. I know I should have said something. We?re having a party once a year. Once a year. You know, why can?t we just relax and dance a little. Do you know that? When you watch you life from the outside and ask yourself Was that really everything? Yeah, I know that. Let?s talk later. Bye. Bye. Good morning, Miss Mick, anything? Oh, Mr. Leutner. Mr. Liebert, please wait inside my office, I?ll be right back. Thank you. Hello. I am sorry for being late. There?s no time to have a coffee. I?ll show you to your class. Are you afraid? No, in fifth grade they?re not in puberty yet. Better prepare yourself, all the giris will fall in love with you. My daughter Emma will be the first. I will introduce you to your colleagues later. You know eachother already. Thank god you?re here for this term. My husband drowns in work since the old physics teacher is no longer here. I always think it?s best to just jump into the cold water. Wanna go? I?ll be with you. Good luck. Is he sexy. A little young maybe. Well. We?ll see about that. Bye. Bye. The babylonians were the first ones to give names to their constellations. They?ve named them after their kings and mythological figures. The Greeks were the next to join them with their heroes. Hercules and Orion for instance. This is the Big Dipper. That?s supposed to be a dipper? The seamen in those times navigated by reading the constellations. They had more phantasy than me then. I can?t disagree with you here, Leo. Munich or Erding? Erding. Too bad. The headmaster in Munich decided to stay. What can I do? I?m going for a run, Mrs Headmistress. Don?t say that, I?m superstitious. Hi! Hi. Please leave you shoes outside, will you? Okay. Or do you wanna join? Whole distance or half one? Whole of course. No, thank you, I rather stay here. I think the doorbell doesn?t work. Yes, it?s not working. Please come in. Didn?t you want to come earlier? To be honest, I didn?t think you?d come anymore. Sorry, I couldn?t quite make it. Just now I wanted to leave. Well, then I?m coming with you. But I won?t run slower for you. You won?t have to. It?s because of biology. I wanted to ask you how you think about the curriculum. The kids these days know everything. They know about sex long before we can start teaching them about it. And still they?re having problems. There are things that they really worry about but they are afraid to ask questions. What are you talking about? I just think we should talk more about feelings and less about facts. More about falling in love and what happens there. And about homosexuality. I mean, it?s important for the boys. You got giris as well. Well, it?s important for them as well. Mr. Leutner, do what you want as long as you?re through with it next week. On the following monday it will be part of the exams. The egg cell is only reproductive for four to six hours after the ovulation and is located in the upper part of the ovaries. In order to achieve impregnation the sperm must reach the cell during that time. Only one sperm can enter the cell before it gets impenetrable. Good. The nucleus will include the genetic information of the father and the mother. It?s good. The fertilized egg cell is called zygote. I see you know the curriculum. You know that I?m gay, don?t you? Yeah, in a way I do. And? Do you mind? No. As long as it doesn?t affect school, why should I mind? Yeah, right. Oh, chic. Hey. Ah, there you are again. The kids have had dinner. Have fun. I love to run but she prefers dancing. Aha. I hope we can still work together. Have I been too harsh? I?m too harsh sometimes, I am sorry. See you tomorrow. Yeah. Thank you. Oh, I was almost a little jealous now. That?s good. Hi. Hi. Something wrong? Morning. Morning. Morning. Morning. Morning. How is he doing? He?s good. Morning, Klaus. Morning, Ina. Morning. I wanted to ask you to overlook this letter before I send it off. You can write whatever you want, you will definitely get the job. I?m not so sure about that. At least seven contenders, please. You totally fit the profile. Age, experience, marital status. Still. Dear colleagues. Morning. I must know now who of you are playing against the Erding team next week. In the last game they beat Amfing 9:1. So, who of you is in? One, two, three, four, five Six, seven, eight, nine. And you, Mr. Leutner? Do you play soccer? Yes. Great, then you?re number eleven. Or, Jochen? You?re playing too, aren?t you? I have plans. Well, that?s not possible, there?s no replacement for you. Come on, Jochen, don?t be like that. I?ll see. Don?t get any wrong ideas, okay? No, no. Jochen, it?s you, isn?t it? Jochen Wenzel. Michael? What are you doing here? I wanted to meet my wife. Your wife? Hm. I see. And who is your wife? Ina. Ina? I always thought that she and Wolfgang are a couple. Wolfgang and Ina know eachother since childhood. That?s my wife. Frederique. We?re running the school together. Hello. What a surprise! He never comes to meet me here. You got children, too? Two. Two? Who would?ve thought. What, do you know Michael? Right, how do we know eachother? From school. Yeah. These coincidences are just too funny. Hm. Folks! That was very good! We got one dance left, then we?re going home. Thank you! I wanted to invite you to dinner! No, you two go alone, will you? Bye! Bye! Come on, dance the last one with me. Me dancing? Hm. What?s he doing here? He fills in for Domr?se. He?s on sick leave, as always when there?s extra work to do. Why don?t I know about that? I only know since yesterday myself. Why are you so upset? Well, I could do without his adolescent rabbiting. Come on, he?s alright. Look, your mom! Hey! Hello, mom. Hello, my darling! Well, how has it been? Cool. Good. Did you sleep well? Yes. Super. I?m going over to Katja, be right back, darling. Bye, see you later! He?s so cool. The shirt and all. Just tell him. You tell him.

Ok now, shake hands and then off to bed. Okay? Tomorrow?s an exciting day. Okay. Good night! Good night. Good night, giris! Good night. Sleep well. So, have a beer? In your room or mine? Downstairs.

They?re closing, shall we go some place else? Well, actually we only wanted to I?m bringing them to bed first. So, that?s really enough. Come on, off to bed. Shall we dance? No discussions. Well We said ten pm the latest. Now it?s eleven. Come on. Man Tomorrow?s an important day, you gotta be fit. I am going for a short walk. Do you like it at our school? Yeah. Freising is just a dump. I moved there because of my husband. What, you?re married? I was. Well, I was pretty young. It wasn?t really good. Hm. Yes. Yes? Can I come in? Be careful with Katja, okay? She?s serious. I told her. Get out everybody. I would like to see you again. Hello. Hello. Nice to have you back. Bye. Bye. Bye! Bye! Shall we have a drink or something? Yeah, okay, sure. Mama, I want more tomatos. Just take them, over there. Ah, I see. You can put the bread inside. Do you know what I did this weekend? It?s nothing special, you?ve been in the stable all day. I?ve been riding Julchen. Super. Do you remember Julchen, Papa? Papa! Julchen? The horse! Papa, I?ve been telling you so much about it. Can you get the cold cuts, Phillip? You and your stupid horses. Excuse me, I am going for another run. Now? Would you pass me the bread? Hi. Tom. There?s no way. I can?t do that. I have to assess you. I got family. There?s no way. Too bad. Would you pass me your glass, Phillip? Hm. Thank you. Thank you, Mama. Your welcome. Say, Jochen Did you know that Tom Leutner is gay? Yes. Since when? Oh, from the beginning. Really? Mr. Leutner is a homo? Phillip. Mama, it?s just what you say. There?s nothing wrong with it. Yes there is, Phillip, that?s discrimination. What do you think the parents will think? What should they be thinking. Do you have an idea how many prejudices people still have. Hm. Poor Katja. Does that mean he loves men? Man, are you really that stupid? I?m not stupid. Emma. She?s just like you. She?d rather bite her tongue than talk about her feelings. She?s in love with him. So what? Have you never been in love in your life? Phillip. Everything you heard here at this table You?ll keep that for yourself, okay? Mr. Leutner should decide for himself when and where he?ll talk about it. Understood? Okay. Okay? You like him so much? You know, Emma, it happens sometimes that you fall in love with someone that you better not fall in love with. Everybody knows. Yes, but they don?t know that he doesn?t feel the same. And they will never find it out. Just try to act as if you?ve never been in love. Just like that? Hm. How is that supposed to work? You have to fall out of love. It?s like a game in your mind. Just imagine all the things you don?t like about him. His age for instance. Right now he?s still young and beautiful but when you?re twenty he?ll be thirtysix, thirtyseven, as old as I am now, an old geezer. Or the way he dresses. That?s so cool. His legs are way too skinny. I don?t care about that. Can?t you think of anything that?s not so cool about him? No. How about badminton? Hm? Out. 15:14. Jochen, try harder. 16:14 for Emma! Great! I won! Oh, I can?t keep up. You?ve simply become too fast for me. I?m sorry, Papa. And? Feel better? Hm. You?re right, Papa. He looks really crappy I think. Come on, Rematch. Where?s my racket? Ah, here. You stay where you are. I?ll be calling you. Say, have I been calling? Allright. Since you?re here now. Happy Birthday. Thank you. Come one, blow them out. I have to think of a wish. Yeah, now I am curious. Yes. Emma, can you take it? Hm. Come here. All the best for your birthday. Hm, thank you. All the best. Thank you. They?re so nice. I?ve brought Tom along, I hope that?s okay. Yes, of course. Happy Birthday. Thank you. Come in. Oh, everything looks so nice. Yes? What?s that about? I?m sorry, Katja has surprised me, I couldn?t think of anything. I?m sorry. Please be careful, okay? Yes. Tom. Tom? Hm? May I ask you something very indiscreet? Have you ever slept with a woman? Yes, I have. Once. And? What was it like? Difficult. You really wanna know about that? Sure. Sure. She was my best friend since we were eight. I haven?t noticed for ages that she was in love with me. Until she forced me to a decisi?n. I was sixteen then. Then I?ve tried to sleep with her. You really tried? Yeah. But it didn?t work. She thought it was because of her. She was sad for a long time. Then I fell in love with a boy, we ended up in bed and that was that. What, that was that. It was clear that I like men. Yes, and now? Do you have a boyfriend? You can tell us. Come on, what?s his name, what does he do. How does he look? Why isn?t he here? Do you know him? Not directly, I told Jochen about him Interesting. When do you know that you?re gay? It depends. Some know before puberty, some know it inbetween and others only know much much later. Well, all of us have tried stuff out when we were young with our best friends. It happened with my french pen pal when he was there. And how did it happen to you, Jochen? To me? Well Do I really have to talk about it here? Yeah. The topic of your homework was How does the dog react when it?s being threatened. So, who wants to read alout? Susanne. So, I always go walking with our dog. And there?s a neighbour?s dog. It?s much bigger than ours. And one time the dog had eaten rat?s poison and had lots of pain. That day I came home earlier from school. And then I found it. He was really growling at me and tried to bite me. When our dog noticed, he ran towards him and barked at him until the other dog ran away. Mr. Wenzel! Hi. Hello! How nice of you to come. I have to show you something. What is it? Look. Does that mean you?re moving out? Yes. That?s impossible. Come on, Ina. You got everything here. Tell me Are you always in the mood for sex? I mean always always? What?s wrong? Jochen is acting so strange lately and I wonder if it?s because of me. Am I no longer attractive? Well, you?re no longer twentyfive. That?s true. So what? Come on, Ina. For me you?re more attractive than ever. Is that why you?re moving away? Among other things. But concerning Jochen He?s a great man. Don?t worry. Hm? Hey. Say, what was it like for you, Jochen? Have you also tried stuff out? Ina, you know everything about me. To be honest, most of the time I have not the slightest idea what?s going on in your mind. Good night. Good night. I don?t know yet where to take it from. What do you think about the 5b? Well, the 5b is really a nice class. Look, I?ve prepared something here. Is it alright like that? Yes. It?s good. Hm. Okay then I?ll do it like that, thank you. Your welcome. Do you have a glas of water? Thank you. I?m getting you. Never! Of course, you will see! No, you can never get me. We will see. No! Your turn! Phillip, Emma, dinner! But But it?s your turn. Coming! Ah! How nice of you to come. We?ve already started. Hello. Hi. Hm, tasty! That?s Julchen. Haha. Oh, come on, Phillip. Say, Emma Do you wanna sleep over at Mirja?s place at the weekend? Sure. Yes? Good. Do look at it again at home, it will certainly be requested. Hello. Shall we go and eat something? I still got two hours. I see, I totally forgot. Can you still do some shopping? Yeah, sure. Are you coming? Yes. Hello, it?s Tom. I know you?re there, so get on the phone. I am a little hello, hi. Yeah, it?s me. Hey, I?ll be a little late. I?ll bring someone. Yeah, see you later, bye. A friend of mine celebrates his birthday, I want you to meet him. That one? No, that?s a model that I dated for a while. You really have no problem with being gay, don?t you? No. Not anymore. So, what it is, do you come? Oh, come on. And what if anybody sees me? Nobody knows you. Hello. Hello. Hey. Happy Birthday. Thank you. You really look pretty terrible. Thank you. Your welcome. May I Jochen. I think I?ll be going. He, he, stay it?s nice here. Your wife is certainly very happy about it. Michael Stop it please. Why, we know eachother quite well, don?t we. Listen, Ina doesn?t know. Oh, that can be changed. A quick phone call and Very funny. No sense of humour, your new friend. But it?s normal, he?s just found out that he turned gay. At forty. That?s your age, isn?t it? Just leave me alone, I don?t know if I?m gay. You still don?t know? When we had out nice little affair you also didn?t know. Really, Jochen you are gay or you aren?t. And you should know it before you have kids and all. But I don?t know. Very sensitive of you, thank you. I had a nightmare, Mama. Can I sleep in your room? Of course, come on. Come on. Come here. What did you dream about? Of bad aliens. Ah they?re for real. Can?t you throw that one away, Mama? What, why? I?m too old for things like that. Somehow I can?t bring myself to. Really? Sleep now, Emma dear. Good night, Mama. Good night. So, here you are. Thank you. Jochen, now stop feeling sorry for yourself. Sooner or later you will have to make a decisi?n anyways. I?ve never cheated on Ina. Never. And we know eachother for a long time. And how long? We were fourteen when we met and sixteen when we became a couple. And what about Michael? That was before. I was having some drinks with Tom. And then? And then I came here. Aha. I?m sorry. Hello. Hi. Look at my great ring, Lena. Jochen? Hm? You?ve forgot the shopping and have been out all night. I?m sorry. Jochen? Yes? We?ve always talked about things. You act as if you?re no longer a part of us. I?m sorry, I don?t really feel well. What?s wrong with you? I cannot talk about it. Good day. Good day. I would like to ask you something. Yes? You get along quite well with my husband, right? Yes. Well, I thought Maybe you know what?s wrong with him. Well, I just thought Have you asked him already? Doesn?t matter, it was a stupid idea to ask you. Best forget about it. Alright. Thank you. Jochen? I booked a room for us in our favourite hotel at Lake Chiemsee. Super, when? I wasn?t talking to you, my darling. You want to be alone Of course, that?s alright. It?s good for the relationship. Oh man, Emma. Yes. Why not. Well. I mean we don?t have to. No, no, let?s go there. What?s he looking at? That?s not possible. Oh. Hello Ina, what are you doing here? I was on my way to the music room. I forgot my bangle. Say, shall we go and have dinner later? I would love to go and have dinner with you but Jochen and I will be away for the weekend. Yeah, it?s good that the two of you will go on vacation together. Are you okay? Yes. Good. Bye. Bye. I really need to talk to you. We?ll be going on vacation later. Later? I thought we?d meet later. Tom. I cannot leave Ina. Leave it then. Have a nice weekend. Shall I drive? Do you need to go home? No, I packed everything already. Did you pack your rain jacket? Hm. And the walking boots? Yes. Ina? Yes. I have to talk to you. Yes. I have fallen in love. I thought so already. It?s good that I finally know. And with whom? Please don?t drive so fast. Whom have you fallen in love with? Do I know her? Ina, for god?s sake, get off the gas, I will tell you! Go on. Who is it then? It?s not a woman. What else? A student? Are you saying you?re leaving me me for a student? It?s Tom. What? Have I heard that correctly? You have fallen in love with Tom? With Tom Leutner? Yes. Ina, come. Look at this! Whoops. I?ve bought all of this for the weekend. I must be completely out of my mind. Have you been with men before? Yes, at thirteen, but everybody does that. Latency phase, I heard about that. With whom? Michael. What Michael? Michael Kaiser. What? With our dancing teacher? You really kept that to yourself for a long time. Yes. How long did it go? Don?t tell me it was a one night stand, I won?t believe you. It was a few months. Our marriage was a lie, wasn?t it? You never liked sleeping with me, really never liked sleeping with me, did you? Yes, Ina, I liked sleeping with you. Earlier. No, later as well. But then no longer. We got two children, Jochen. What?s that got to do with the children. We?re a family, it?s got something to do with that. I?ve fallen in love. In love? We both knew that it could happen to one of us at some time. Yes, but Yes, but not with a man. I mean I mean I am totally defenseless against something like that, I can?t do anything, what am I supposed to do, Jochen? Tell me what I can do! You are the only one I can ask. Is it temporary? I mean Will it pass by? I mean I mean, you know, I have no experience with things like that. Is it an affair? I don?t think so. No affair? Jochen Jochen, I You can eat alone. I?m not on vacation. Oh. Please just start driving. I always thought it was my fault. I thought I wasn?t the right one. Not sexy enough. Nose too crooked. Not cute enough. The whole package. But you don?t stay twenty forever and at some point I simply stopped thinking about it. I almost had everything that I wished for. A job that I like. Friends. Children. A family, a husband that I love and that I like living with. Only the sex was somehow not the greatest. Well At some point I told myself that anybody has to compromise. And the sex was the compromise that I had to make. It was okay, I could live with it. Hm? And now? Now it?s all no longer valid. Well. At least you know the truth now. Dear Ina Just sleep on, I?ll be going downstairs. Did I ever tell you how much I like you? I know you do. Can?t you sleep next to me today, just today? Excuse me. Err have you seen Tom? That tall, thin one with with the dark blonde hair? Over there. Wow! What a great car! Will you let me drive? No, no way. Hey, please, come on. He?s right, Tom. I also think you shouldn?t drive. Hi. What are you doing here? I thought you have a problem with gays. Is that your boyfriend? That?s Jochen. Hello Jochen. I don?t like threesomes. Hey, wait. There won?t be a threesome, stay here. So, come on! Say it! You are simply drunk. Not that drunk. You are simply drunk and young and stupid. I?m not drunk, not a bit. Only desperate. Oh. Where are you coming from? What are you making, an omelette? No, scrambled eggs. Want some too? Hm. Didn?t you want to drive away? Yeah, we couldn?t make it. Shit. Hi, it?s Phillip. Eh We cannot have the party today, my parents are here. Can you tell everyone? Okay, thank you. Ciao. Man, this is really a shitty situation for me. I?m sorry. Shall we go for a run? Okay. Thank you. Ready? Let?s go. No, let?s take the back door. But my shoes. Doesn?t matter, come on. Hi. Hi. I?ll have a shower. Ah, Emma! Bye. Hello. Hello, darling. Thank you! Hi. Was it nice? Hm. Yes? I couldn?t sleep. Oh. But it was fun. Yes. Come on, it?s dinnertime. Hi, dad. Hi, darling. Something wrong? No. Yes. Ina, don?t. Why, they will notice anyways. So, Papa Jochen and I are having a crisis, so it could get loud now and then. Anything else? I don?t want that. I want you to get along. It?s not possible at the moment, Emma. Because you are always so mean. If I was Papa Emma! It?s true, isn?t it? No, it?s not true. I am the reason. But we?ll talk about it at another time. Would you please go upstairs, I?ll have to talk to your mother alone. That was too early. And we should discuss things like this before. You didn?t discuss with me before as well. What will you do now? I don?t want to loose you all. Then end this. Morning. Jochen, I Sometimes I am pretty lonely. My parents live far away. I do have friends, but no family. And I was drunk. But I?m not young and stupid. I wanted to hurt you. Tom. I cannot leave my children. Shit, there?s just no way to beat that. Oh, sorry. Shit. Everyone will know tomorrow. Well, maybe not. You have no idea. Hi. Hi. What?s wrong? Nothing. Phillip, what has happened? It?s not your business. Phillip. Mama? Is Jochen there? No. Will you help me set the table? When will he come? I don?t know. Is he at Tom?s place? How did you get that idea? Is he there or is he not there? I have no idea. You don?t really know much it seems. Phillip. I don?t know where your father is. And I don?t know how all of this will go on. I don?t want to see him again. Never again. Of course you want to. Will you tell me now whom you had a fight with? With Leo. He saw us. What? You and Tom? Couldn?t you have watched it, for god?s sake? Don?t you care about anything anymore? I find it unbelievable that you not even find it necessary to protect the children! This is the worst of all! Don?t imagine this will go on like that. You cannot have your fling going on and pretend with your family that nothing happened. Impossible! I will no longer, I can no longer. Either you You end this, this involvement or you?re moving out! And the first thing you?ll do now is going to the children to talk to them! Phillip, open up please. You can go to your lover, Jochen. We don?t need you here. Phillip, I?m your father. Open up the door! What is it? You?re not a child anymore. I cannot lie to you. I hate you, go away! Come in. Jochen. It?s good you?re coming. Some parents have been calling. Already. Oh. I wanted to tell you myself. That?s why I came. You know how parents are. Sit down. How would you react if your son came home and told you that he saw how two of his male teachers were kissing. I understand your worries, Mrs. Konrad. And I wish I knew what to say about it. I can only assure you that this will no longer happen on this school ground. Jochen, you?re a good teacher. And this doesn?t change because you Well, let?s say have an unusual affair. I could let you use sick leave for the last days of the term. Sick leave. No, that?s impossible. I I can?t just run away. Oh, I respect that. But I don?t want Ina?s future to be in danger in any way. After the holidays she?ll take over the Mathilden Secondary School in Erding. And that means, Jochen, that you will have to restrain yourself in public, for god?s sake. Is it official? Ah, thank god. At least not everything is ruined that way. Is it that serious? Mrs. Wenzel, I don?t know how you raise your children I mean, I have nothing against homosexuals, but not on school ground. And I cannot approve of my son being taught by this Mr. Leutner anymore. And neither by the other one what?s his name againhm Mr hm Mrhm Wenzel. Oh. Mr. Wenzel. Yes. Please excuse me. Thank you, Klaus. Thank you for everything. Oh. You are here. That?s great, that?s really wonderful, the telephones won?t stop ringing. I know, Ina, I?m sorry. My husband is gay, what do you say to that? Ina. Ina. Ina. Ina. I can no longer. Somehow somehow everything falls apart. The parents, the colleages, how everybody looks at me. It?s bad enough. But the children, what am I supposed to tell the children? How should I explain to them that their father has turned gay. I don?t think I?m gay. No? What else then. What else then? Your father is just passing through a crisis and therefore has a boyfriend, shall I tell them that? Leave me alone. I love you, Jochen. You?re a part of me. It cannot all be over. Morning. Morning. Were you at Wolfgang?s place? Yes. I wish it was like before and you belonged to me. I belong to you, Ina. Yes, but You no longer desire me and I can tell myself a thousand times and find thousand reasons why it hasn?t got anything to do with me, but It?s got nothing to do with you. It?s my life and I only got one. Can?t you just fall out of love? Just like I did. If it only was that simple, Emma Do you love him? Are you staying? I don?t think there?s a way. And why not? You know, Phillip Papa and I have gone a long way together and You ruin everything. Ina, we got two wonderful children. It will stay that way. But that?s not everything. I only got one life as well.
