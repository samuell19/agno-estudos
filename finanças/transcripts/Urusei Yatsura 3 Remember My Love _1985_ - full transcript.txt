A Kitty Films Production Darling, don't forget me. Please, don't forget about me. This is unforgivable! This is not to be forgiven! This is not to be forgiven! How dare they invite everyone EXCEPT me... ...the Old Woman of the Oak Forest, over for a birth celebration! You just watch me, you hear! You just watch me! You just watch me! Damn! Very well... I'll get even! I swear, I'll get even! I'll get even! That's right... ...I'll put a curse on them! I'll put a curse on them! The newborn was a girl, was it not? Thus shall the curse be fulfilled! When the babe becomes a woman, her fate shall be such... ...that she and her beloved man will be forever separated! No matter how much she may love him, the love won't be mutual. No matter how much she may fall in love, the love will be shattered... ...and her dreams shall never come true! Thus it shall be! Her destiny is now determined! A red string? That's right. You see, the story goes that there's... ...an invisible red string wrapped around everyone's left pinky... ..and that string connects you to another person who has... ...it similarly wrapped around his or her pinky. Hey, isn't it supposed to be knotted around the right little toe? People from certain parts of the country say that, too. So is it connected even now? Yes, that's right. That red string, you see, would never break... ...no matter how far apart two people may be. And even if the two people were to pass each other... ...in a dense crowd of people, it would never get tangled up. And furthermore, we're taught that each one of us is destined... ...to be linked with a certain person from the time we're born. I bet Darling and I are connected by a red string, too! Shut up! But, this is a story told on Earth, so... Darling! I refuse! I didn't say anything yet! I know it all, even if you don't say anything! Whenever you get... ...this face... ...it can ONLY mean that you're going to ask me something! Oh, yeah? If you know that much, then that's time saved! Darling, for a change, I want to take you out on a date. Of course, we're always together, but once in a while... ...we ought to go out on a date, just the two of us. Movies, a picnic, shopping... what's your fancy? Darling... Say, what's that, Darling? |dunno.. I'm gonna go check it out! “Märchen“: German for “Fairy Tale.“ “Tomobiki Märchenland?“ Oh, wow! Darling, I know where we'll be going on our date!

Wo! Miss! Darling! “The Märchenland Map“ “The Märchenland Map“ That bastard! So? Did you find him? So? Did you find him? No such luck! Just great! Well? Nope! He's nowhere in sight! He's nowhere?! Nowhere?! How in the world! Think about it... It's the height of Indian Summer... ...in an amusement park, with the smell of liberty in the air! And eye-catching performers and parades everywhere! And in such a place, Ataru is all alone with Lum! No one's watching them! How can we allow such an enviable thing to occur? But, Megane... ...this Tomobiki Märchenland... I didn't pay much attention to it when they were building the place, but... ...now, it's pretty funky! The Märchenland... it sure lives up to its name. Th..they're robots, aren't they? Idiot! If they aren't robots, then what the hell are they supposed to be?! You see, modern applications of the latest electronics technology... ...are a whole lot “trekkier“ than one might imagine. You little brats, excuse yourselves! Wh...wh...what the?! What the hell was that, you little...?! Break! Break! One! Two! Three! Four! 'Ya-dam.! Wh...what the hell were they?! Say, Mendou... ...don't you feel like we're the only two people on the ocean... ...as if we're in the middle of a long voyage... Miss Lum... and Moroboshi... where could they be? Mendou? U... Umechiyo! It is! It is you, Umechiyo! How could I ever forget you? How could I ever forget the cascade of plum flowers on your back? My... my first pet octopus! Mendou! B...but... But, why?! You were supposed to be dead... Umechiyo! What is it, Umechiyo?! Do you want to tell me something? Umechiyo... Umechiyo! Ouch! Wow! So this is what they meant by an amusement park! It's totally awesome! It's super! It's touching! Ryuunosuke! You're supposed to be working! We gotta sell, sell, and keep on selling... ...so we can save up for next summer's Hamajaya Teashop renovation! That's something only a really serious working fellow has a right to say! Men shouldn't be concerned with such picky details. I'M A GIRL! I'm in orbit Dammit, I want to hop on at least one of the rides... If I only had the money... Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Time is messed up! Space is messed up, too! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! What the hell was that?! Oh no! Huh? Th...th...that's me! What the heck is an amusement park supposed to be? Pardon me, if I made you wait. Who said that I'd waited?! Well... consider it a service. Behold! Look where my Supernatural Sensor has led us! It's the newly opened Tomobiki Märchenland! It's not the usual feeling... I have a very uneasy feeling about this. I, too, have had a persistent uneasy feeling for the last few minutes.. That's called heartburn, you fool! That's called heartburn, you fool! Have one... Have one.. I don't want one! Have one... Stop. We shall examine the true nature of this supernatural abnormality! Very well, Uncle... we shall proceed. This can't be! Charge! Looks like we're back at the entrance again, eh? Why you! Pardon us! It's the back door again. A forbidden zone, perhaps! Hey, what's the meaning of all this?! Who would create such a thing... and for what...? What in the world is going on inside?! What's the matter with you? What's with the glum looks on your faces? Er, well, nothing, really! Maybe you ate something that didn't agree with you. Don't confuse me with you! Seems that lately I'm getting tired more easily ...I'm just not in good condition. Oh, you, too? You know, I've been seeing strange things lately... ...because I haven't been getting enough sleep! Me, too! Me, too! Looks like we're all tired! Attention, Ladies and Gentlemen... Thank you for all your patience. In a few moments, there will be a Super Magic Show inside the black tent... ...right next to the clock tower, to be hosted by Ruu, the Master Magician. A Super Magic Show? Sounds fun! Let's go, everyone! If you're inviting us, then why not! Magic? I'm sure it's just a bunch of tricks for little kids! Here you go! You're invited to the Magic Show! Yes, I'll be going, of course! By the way, what's your name? And your address and phone number? Darling! Let's go! Uh, your address and phone number...! Well, shall we be going now? Ya know, I've never seen a magic show before... Really? In that case, you can't miss this one, now can you? If we're going, then let's get some good seats. Leave that to me! Say, can we have one of your pamphlets? Sure! Here you go! Ladies and Gentlemen... ...welcome to Ruu the Master Magician's Magic Show! Awesome! Awesome! Why, that's the gal from before! Now, we need a volunteer from the audience to come up onstage. Any volunteers, folks? Ataru! Ataru! Darling! Miss, I shall volunteer. I figured you would... Yeah! Right on! Yeah! What an idiot! That shameless fool ought to disappear for good! Now, Ladies and Gentlemen, please sit back and enjoy the show! One! Two! Three! Hey, what do you think happened? What's going on? Is that the end of it? It's been 5 minutes now. Where did the magician and his assistant go? Ya know, this is a little strange. Yo, Megane, you think Ataru is still stuck inside that thing? A|| right...! Let's go check it out! Darling! Da... Wh...what the?! Weird! Oh. my...! What is it, Lum? D...Darling, is that you? What're you talkin' 'bout, who else could it be? Holy hippo! Ataru! Ataru! Wow! Is this what magic is about?! What're you guys so excited about? Hmm? What the he“ are you dam"?! That skin is real. Is...Is he alive? Hey! Hey, Ataru! Hey, Ataru! Huh? Huh? Take a deep breath... Huh? Take a deep breath... Take a deep breath... Huh? Huh? Just breathe deeply, dammit! Huh? What the hell, man! Yo Megane, I brought it. Good. Listen to me Ataru, don't let this get to you. Well, it looks like he's got a firm grasp of the reality of it now. I... I... I'm a hippo! Darling! Darling! Moroboshi! Moroboshi! Ataru! Moroboshi! Darling, hang on! Darling! Aha! As the blood drains from his face, it turns from pink to pale purple. How in the world could this happen?! I don't recall raising you to be a hippo! Until today, I don't recall growing up to be a hippo, either! Ataru, don't you understand the grave implications of turning into a hippo? Now that you're a hippo, we'll have to fix all your clothes. That'll be expensive. Besides, if you think about it, there's the problem of feeding you. Say, Ataru, what do hippos eat, mainly? How should I know?! But, Dear, it's not ALL bad. Imagine, for example, that hippos become as popular as pandas and koala bears. There'd be TV appearance fees, merchandising... ...royalties from publishing our biographies, profit-sharing... ...They'd even pay off our mortgage! Right, Dear? Why, you're right about that. What kinda parents are you?! Put yourself in my shoes! Imagine you've just become a hippo for just a while! It's tough! It's sad! Darling! With me being a hippo, I can't even go out girl-hunting! You never get tired of that, do you? Hey, anyways, why on earth were you turned into a hippo? He is cursed! What the...! Where did you come crawling from? There was no answer at the door, so we let ourselves in. How do you do. Miss Sakura! You've come just for me! I'm touched! The appearance has changed, but the soul remains the same. Excuse me, but.. What did you mean when you said "curse"? Hmm... Uncle! Don't worry... I'll share them with you. Okay, that's fine, then. Weren't we talking about a curse?! Oh, that's right! To put it to you bluntly, your son has been put under a very deadly curse. And it is a very strong one, indeed. And that is why we got heartburn! No, it caused us to feel uneasy! No, it caused us to feel uneasy! Oh, that's right! Just look at this force! Both it, and the power that created the barrier at Tomobiki Märchenland... ...are highly extraordinary! Who would want to put Darling through such a terrible ordeal? The answer to that is... ...the same someone who invoked the curse...and that is... ...someone even we don't know! There is only one thing we CAN say. And that is, this curse is not the end of it. Something even worse than this may yet happen. P...please, don't say such unlucky things! Lum... It's raining, huh? L...Lum... It sure is raining a lot. Don't worry, Darling! You'll be back to normal, for sure! I'll find a way! Darling... But... But... what if this curse can never be broken in my lifetime...? What if I'm like this forever...? What would you do...? I... I will never, ever leave you, no matter what happens! No matter what you look like, you and I will always be together! Like Shinobu was saying at the library... ...two people destined to be together are connected by a red string. You and I are, too! You and I are! 'Cause... 'Cause... I'm your wife! L...Lum... Lum... Darling... Who's there?! Ahem! Good evening, Lum. Y...you know my name! Who are you?! Huh? You don't know? That's strange. Voilá! Why, it's you! "Is not “You,” ".5 “Rum” Why, you... you... I'm telling you, it's "Ruu". Oh, shut up! Turn Darling back to normal! Why you...! Tsk, tsk. I'm not an easy catch, you know. You! Why do you hate Darling enough to put him through this?! I wonder... If you want to know, then follow me. Hey, you! Hold it! Hey! Hey, hey! Come back here! Hey! Come on! This way, this way! Enough already! Hold it! Come back here! Hey! This way! Come back here! Hey, hey! Hey you! Hey! Where did you go, Ruu?! What the... Ruu! You'd better come out! Where are you?! Just about time... Ruu! Where did you go?! You'd better come out! Lum! Ruu! If you want that fool to be human again, then follow me. Hold it! Wh... what in the... So you finally made it, Lum! Huh? Eh? Is that... me? Lum, do you remember? Lum... I'm too late! Eww! What's that?! What is that thing?! That's Moroboshi. Didn't you know? Seems he became a hippo yesterday. Seems he became a hippo yesterday. No way! He quit being human? Looks like it. But how did he become a hippo in the first place? Maybe he went to sleep too quickly after eating. Moron! If you do that, you become a cow! Oh, that's right! And this is the Year of the Cow. “Mooo!“ A raccoon... When Darling finds out, he'll be disappointed... Darling? Darling? Darling! Oh, you're awake. But you can't escape from here... ...as Master Ruu's best servant, Oshima, that's me, is watching you. I told you, you can't escape from here! Besides, Master Ruu's best servant Oshima, that's me, is watching... Are you by any chance the only servant? How... how did you know?! If you say that you're the “best,“ then it's a short step! Speaking of which, I won't let you move a step! Where's Ruu?! I said, I won't let you move a step! So, you're awake! You finally showed yourself! You useless bum! You useless bum! Uh... At least, you know that I've tried! You should show your true self now! In Japanese folklore, both are tricksters. Are you a raccoon, too? Or a fox? Don't take me lightly! At times, I'm a mysterious pierrot. At others, a powerful magician. What is my true identity, you wonder... Watch and be amazed! Yeah! You're amazed! You're amazed! I'm bored, 'cause he's only a kid. What do you mean, “only a kid?!“ I have incredible powers! Look! Splendid! Wonderful! I can float in the air like this, and even change a person into an animal! Those aren't things to be proud of! Why did you put Darling through such a terrible ordeal? 'Cause I thought that if he was a hippo... ...your feelings toward him would change. Say What?! But, no! You stuck by that fool. So that's why I planned to abduct you here! Why did you have to make such a plan?! 'Cause you'll be much happier if you break up with that idiot! Master Ruu can't stop thinking that you look like his mother, you see! Shut up! Shut up! That's a lie! What she said was an absolute lie! I don't care if you've got a Mother Complex or whatever... ...it has nothing to do with me! Look, I'm happiest when I'm with Darling! Change Darling back into a human being right this instant! Oh, just leave him alone and he'll eventually become human again. You mean it? Of course! That's my Master Ruu! What a magnificently weird catch! Can it! But by the time that idiot changes back to human form... ...he'|| probably be disgusted with you. Lum, look out the window. Darling?! Lum... did you really betray me? ls it because I've become a hippo? No, Darling! I'm not like that! It's no use, no use! No one on the other side can see or hear you. Darling... Eh? This... Where is this?! This is the other side of the mirror. This world is completely different from the one we were in before. I created it. |won't give up yet! Darling! I'm coming back to you now! Welcome back, Lum. What?! An eyewitness?! Yes, this person, sir! Y...You?!>! Yeah, he says he saw it. He saw Lum flying toward Tomobiki Märchenland, chasing a man. A man?! So, no leads? Even with that one good piece of information! Ehh? How dare you try to cash in, using the information... ...that I have painstakingly obtained! Don't worry 'bout it! Don't worry 'bout it! We're friends! We're friends! Only when it's convenient for you! Hey, guys, don't you think it's a little peculiar around here? What is? The atmosphere. It's too different from yesterday. Now you mention it, the robots... ...the aliens and the goblins... ...where did they all go? Maybe they don't use them on weekdays, to save energy. They weren't robots... they were real. Miss Sakura! When you say “real,” what do you mean? Yesterday, Tomobiki Märchenland was probably linked... ...to another world. The strange things you saw must have been goblins and aliens... ...spilling over from that other world. But look! Now, one can detect signs of supernatural energy... ...only in Ataru, but yesterday we could see such signs everywhere! Then you mean that the gateway to that other world has been closed? Probably. Is it 'cause of that magician guy? The guy who made me like this? Could be. Then, then... the man that Lum was supposedly chasing was... That, we don't know! Why, she might have completely forgotten you... ...and started a voyage to a new life. Lum, running away?! You can't be serious! So what if that's true?! So what?! It's none of my concern at all! Actually, I'm delighted. This means it's good-bye to annoying jealousy and electric shocks! I'm totally free again! Still, I wonder where Lum is now... Yo! You're looking pretty miserable, dude! Miss Benten! And Ran, too! Really? A curse, I see. Yeah. Either Lum or Darling has been cursed, and this is the result. Sakura was saying the same thing. I bet it's Lum who's cursed. 'Cause this husband of hers is much too stupid to get himself cursed. Miss Benten! Isn't that a bit harsh of you? I understand. But, if that's so, then the question is, who put the curse on Lum, and why? What's with that look?! I put it to you straight... it wasn't me! It wasn't me, you got that! Then, whoever might it be? You have a sharp tongue! Who do YOU think it is? Well, let me see... Now, Miss Benten's got a wildy decisive attitude. And Oyuki has a cool spirit, full of womanliness. And Ram's got charm, and occasionally, signs of being off-the-wall. Well, everyone has fine points, so telling me to choose one... I was a fool to ask! A curse?! Yes. Do you have any idea as to who would want to put a curse on Lum? |dunno.. Our daughter isn't the kind of person other people hold grudges against. It's not possible that anyone would... No, dear! Don't even think about saying anything like... “...Lum has gotten tired of her husband!“ Are you nuts?! Even if her good-for- nothing husband is now a hippo... ...it's not impossible to think that Lum might go after some other man... ...but even if I thought so, I sure wouldn't say so to other people! You just said it very nicely. Oh, wait! There is one thing that comes to mind... as to why she might be cursed. It must've been just after Lum was born, about her birth celebration. There was a complaint by a certain person. It turned out that the cause was a lost letter... ...but she misunderstood, and said, “I'll curse the child!“ My goodness, it was a mess! And who is this person, may I ask? It was the Old Woman of the Oak Forest. The Old Woman of the Oak Forest... Welcome! Welcome! Here, why don't you make yourselves at home? It's kind of you to come all this distance! Kind of you to come! Um... So, regarding the curse... Um... So, regarding the curse... Oh, yes, yes! Certainly, way back then, I did put a curse on the baby. You see, I put that curse into a glass orb, and mailed it to... ...the Milky Way “Curses-R-Us” Management Organization! The Milky Way... what?! The Milky Way “Curses-R-Us” Management Organization! What's that? Don't you know? Don't you know? No... OK, you know the feeling of REALLY wanting to make someone suffer? This organization takes care of all the details. A-ha... It's a pretty simple system. You just enclose your desire to curse someone inside a glass orb ...then just mail it, along with the right fee, to the Organization. Then they take on the responsibility of handling the power of the orb's curse. What kinda organization is that?! You know so much, and at such a young age! That's Ran for you. I imagine you're a frequent customer. Don't make a fool out of me! If I want someone to suffer from a curse... ...I'd much prefer inflicting slow torture with my own hands! Why would I want to ask others to do such a thing?! Not me! I see! And why in the world am I being picked on? Why should I be?! Why should I be?! Why should I be?! The culprit is this Old Woman right here! This Old Woman right here! It seems to be so... It seems to be so... It IS so! My looking like this, and Lum's disappearance... ...they're both this old lady's fault! We can put aside your problem for now... ...but what happened to Lum is unforgivable! Wait! Wait! You have to listen to the complete story! It's true that I did send in the orb with my curse in it... ...but right after I'd done that, I found out that I was invited to the party after all. So I canceled my curse! So, what now? I'm not gonna give up yet! I'm gonna check everything out, 'til I find Lum! Wow, there's some good in you after all, Ran! If she's not around, I'll have no one to take my frustrations out on! Regardless of your motives, I agree that we should continue our search for Lum. Me, too! But what are we gonna do, now that we have nowhere to turn to? Here's what we do! Milky Way “Curses-R-Us“ Management Organization Freeze! If you keep quiet, we won't do anything ugly... ...but if you resist, you'll end up like this! Hey, you! Take us to the computer room! Yes, ma'am... This is it, ma'am... Hope you don't mind me checkin' it out. This... That... There... Here's the data related to Lum, ya see! There ain't any current curses registered for her at all! But, there was a damned weird cancellation for one of them! What?! Hey! What's that supposed to mean?! W...well... You see, a curse is more or less a problem of probability... ...so what we do is exert pressure on the victim's space-time continuum... ...in order to increase the potential of that person experiencing... ...his or her most unfortunate future, out of the uncountable possibilities. Thus, in order to amplify, many times over, the power... Of the curses contained in our customers' orbs... ...we rely on experts in that area, as you can see. In the case of Miss Lum, the person you're inquiring about... ...the records indicate that the orb was lost in transit... ...by the Galaxy Mail Service, and so the curse itself... ...is recorded as “destination unknown.“ What you see here are the so-called “Time Measurement Devices“... ...which start operating when each curse is created. Thus, they are supposed to indicate, without exception... ...the existence of all the curses in the Milky Way. I believe that Miss Lum was from Planet Oni... What the...?! What an incredible curse this is! Darling... There... What did you follow me for?! H...how cold of you to say such a thing! L...Let me tell you straight that Master Ruu is in fact a very kind boy... ...even if he doesn't seem to be that way. I'm not sure why he's been going overboard lately... ...but he did rescue me when I was badly injured on a mountain... ...so you see, I owe him my life. I'm in no position to say this, but would you be kinder to Master Ruu? Why?! Why should I?! You see, he's lonely... He hasn't seen either of his parents for a very long time. His parents are both professional quiz contestants, you see. “Professional quiz contestants?“ Oh, don't you know? They make their living competing on TV quiz shows. That's a weird occupation. For the past ten years or so, they've been competing in... ...“The Pan-Galactic I-Got-It We-Asked- 100-People Quiz Show...” ...so they're out there traveling. Because it involves crossing the Milky Way... ...they won't be back for at least another 5 years. Really, what a weird business to be in! So his only companions are me, and a private tutor named Lahla. Master Fluu must be really lonely. After all, he's still a child. So you can talk straight, after all. I always do that! Button your lip! You're just repeating what Lahla says! Don't believe anything she said! Got that?! Say, what's that? Isn't it beautiful? This is my treasure. I found it last year. The town that I was living in was a hub station for the Galaxy Mail Service. So, everyday, all kinds of spaceships came and went, to and from... ...planets I've never even heard about. Anyway, what's with all that, you couldn't sleep at night. That's why I kept going to the junkyard up the valley. But then, one night, this thing came out of a pile of junk... ...and started talking to me... “Started talking“ to you? Yeah. Not exactly in words, but to me it felt like that. Ever since then I've been able to do really neat things. Even before that, I did have some superhuman powers... ...but they were peanuts compared to what I can do now! Now, I can even time-travel! “Time-travel?!“ Yup. That's howl found you, Lum. Don't you remember? Not at all... I'd never, ever, seen such a dazzling smile. It was like the Sun shining... So you not only have a Mother Complex, but a Lolita Complex as well?! And at such a young age! Later, I watched you at different times. You always had that dazzling smile! But after you met Moroboshi Ataru, you never smiled like you used to. How rude of you to say that! For your information, I'm still smiling a lot, even after meeting Darling! But it's not like how you used to! Of course not! |can't be like a little girl forever! People are supposed to fall in love and lead their lives! Sure, there are hardships here and there! No! That's no good! Hey, stop being an adult! With my glass ball, I can... I can... take care of such things... Stop that nonsense! That ball of yours looks awfully suspicious to me! Lemme take a good look at it! No! Lum, I've sworn to bring back your smile once again! I'll make sure you break up with Moroboshi Ataru! We know that the curse exists, but what else can we do about it, eh? So I guess you'll just have to sit there and take it easy. Benten, I'm all ready. Good! Ready for what? We're goin' home! If Lum isn't on Earth, it's no good staying here. Hey Ataru, I'll be hoping that you'll be human again soon. In the meantime, hang in there, you hear! Jariten... Let's get rollin'! That was the night, leaving behind only those three twinkling trails... ...that Ten and Lum and all their friends left Tomobiki Town for good. Those of us left here were all struck by a sadness... "almost as if a great festival had finally come to an end. Sign: Tomobiki Station But, when a festival ends, everyday life begins again... Even without Ten or Lum, the days continue to pass by. A few days passed, and Ataru regained his human form... ...and without wasting a moment's time, began girl-hunting again. From then on, it seemed like, little by little... ...we were getting used to life without Lum. But... "Something was different. Shinobu! Can you lend us a hand? What?! Why me? Oh, c'mon, be kind! Please? My goodness! Can't you see that I'm a mere slip of a girl? Huh?! It's no good! Don't worry 'bout it, then! There! You got it? There! It seemed to me that, slow though it was... ...we clearly began to drift into a different kind of time flow. Why? Why can't I understand your feelings like I used to? Here you go... Why... why don't you talk to me anymore? Tonight, all of our thoughts filled the air. It was as if we all, suddenly, at the same time, accepted the fact... ...that Lum was no longer with us. We were waitin' for you Megane... I... ...| heard that you had returned home from your travels, so I called... Megane... I... Don't say it, Chibi. There are no words to describe our youth. Megane, are you really... Is this how we become adults? By the loss of our irreplaceable loved ones? And, before long, we became high school seniors. As always, Ataru exhibited his girl-hunt tendencies... Mademoiselle! ...from one day... to the next day... and the next... Yeah! “I bet Darling and I are connected by a red string, too!“ L...Lum... Lum... Why do I remember you now?! Why? So that's it! So that was it! I was subconsciously longing for Lum! Now, no matter how much I girl-hunt... no matter how much... much... MUCH...! ...it's never a joy! And when I think about it, it's no wonder, 'cause Lum's not around! The thrill of the thought of Lum discovering me girl-hunting... ...that sweet suspense, like the scent of immorality... ...in the challenge of figuring out how to do it skillfully and secretly... ...without those, the joy of girl-hunting is reduced by half! Without realizing it... I'm becoming abnormal! Lum! Where have you gone?! Without you, I'm... Very good. It's a good thing I waited, and believed in you. What a pleasant surprise! It's very nice of you to come and find me! Lemme see now... where might we have met? The shopping mall? The park? Or, could it be the train station? That's a 10-point deduction! Wha... whadd'ya mean...? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just used to doing that all the time. My card... I see... Miss Lahla, a private tutor. I've actually come to talk to you about Lum... A...about Lum?! So it's all because of that orb. Yes. Ruu doesn't know that the orb contains the curse. Ever since Ruu got hold of it, he's been changing. He's begun keeping many secrets. Now, this. He may think he's acting of his own volition... ...but in reality, it seems as if he's being controlled by the orb. Controlled? But it's just an orb, isn't it? No. The curse has endured a long time, and you mustn't treat it lightly. Just look... It's taken Lum from you. Don't you realize?! You and your friends were once living through moments filled with joy! But with Lum gone, the law of causality has been destroyed. You and your friends are now living a history that shouldn't be! Then... then you're saying that we have to bring Lum back? Right. But in order to do that, your power is required. Don't you understand the reason why Lum stayed on in this world? It was you! You will help get Lum back, won't you? Stamp: Very well done! Very well done! The passage that leads to subspace... ...and the magnetic field of the full moon are directly related. We've got to go tonight! When you say a “passage,“ do you mean...? Yes, Tomobiki Märchenland! Ataru, you do want to see Lum again, don't you? Yeah! Then close your eyes, and think only about Lum! Only about Lum?! Yes! Since Ruu's trail stops here... ...unless your feelings synchronize with Lum's... ...we won't be able to reach their position in subspace! But... but... just about Lum?! Damn, that's what I'm worst at! If you can't, then you'll never, ever be able to see Lum again! Darling! You came for me! Come on! Think about Lum! Oh... To hell with it! Lum! Darling! You concentrated on your carnal desires, didn't you?! Well... you see Oh, no! We're gonna be trapped! Darling! Shame on you! Ruu! Where's Ruu?! Well... I dunno... You just watch me, Lahla! What do you think you're doing, Ruu?! There's no way I'm gonna let Lahla destroy my plans! We're moving to another space! It's something the ball has taught me how to do. They won't be able to follow us there. Let's live there together, Lum! Just the three of us. No... No way! I'm not going! Let go! Let go! No way! No way! Let go! No way! Let go! Let go! No way! No! Oh no! The moon's going out of alignment! This may be the last chance ever! C'mon, hurry! Lum... Lum... No way! Lum, let go! No way! |won't let go! I'm... I'm... I'm going back to Darling's world! Darling! Lum! Lum! Darling! Lum! Master Ruu... please don't go overboard like this... Lum... Our ship may be totalled, but as long as we have this... No, Ruu! Lahla! Enough of this, Ruu! Can't you see that you're being controlled by the orb? Don't you realize what the orb really is? It's an orb filled with a curse that was meant to bring misfortune to Lum! That's a lie! I'm going to use this to make Lum happy! With this, I'm gonna give her back the smile she used to have before she... ...met Moroboshi Ataru, then we're going to live together forever! I won't let you get in the way! So long, Lahla! No, Ruu! I didn't want to say this, but now I have to. Lum is actually your distant ancestor! What?! My... ancestor?! Lum? My? After doing a little research, it became clear. It's no wonder she resembles your mother. You see, inside that orb is a curse that... ...Lum will never be together with her loved one. Between the time that curse was put in there... ...and the time you found it, 300 years had passed. During that long stretch of time, the powers of the curse... ...were amplified to an incredible intensity. Gosh! So they're from the future... The orb tried to manipulate you, Lum's descendant... ...into executing the curse, twice over! How... How was I supposed to know... that I was Lum's descendant“? Well, I believe that's enough of that. L...Lum! Darling! Lum! Darling! It's useless to try and break us apart! I'll... I'll find my Darling, no matter what! A string... A red string... Darling! Darling? Lum... Darling! We were tied together by a red string after all! Darling... What's wrong? Aren't you happy that we're together again? O...of course I'm happy, Lum... What is it? What's wrong? What've you got behind your back? Huh? What? Nothing... Darling! Let me see it! Lum... Darling... I'm... I'm... In“ ...ASHAMED OF YOU! Darling, you're... Darling, you're an. ...idiot. Lahla? If we turn back the clock, Lum will forget all about me, right? That can't be helped. What just happened should not have happened in the first place... ...and interfering in the past is absolutely forbidden. But, Ruu... ...Lum may forget all about you, but you won't forget about her, will you? Of course not, Lahla. Why should I?! Good. That's the way it's supposed to be. From time to time, people will enter and leave your life... ...and you have to learn to deal with that. Uh-huh. Now let's close the passage! Farewell, Lum. Hey, have you heard about that Tomobiki Märchenland... ...they built on the edge of town? Yeah! I got a glimpse of it while they were still building the damn thing. That place is gonna be incredible, man! They open tomorrow! Eh...? It sure sounds interesting! Want to go? Want to go? Do you want to? Wow, I've never been to an amusement park before! Great! Why don't we go tomorrow? Sure. Hello there, Lum! These are tickets for tomorrow's Märchenland opening, see. How about going with me? No, Lum! Tomorrow, you shall go with me, Mendou Shutaro! Hey, Lum! Hey, let's check out the Märchenland! Rei will be there, too, so you should bring your Darling. Hey, let's go! I'll ask Darling! Darling! Err... Lum...! Shinobu! Tomorrow's admission tix, babe! Babes' signs: Pepper, Ginger, Sugar. Shinobu! Tomorrow's admission tix, babe! Babes' signs: Pepper, Ginger, Sugar. Babes' signs: Pepper, Ginger, Sugar. No way! Why don't you go with Lum? No way! Why don't you go with Lum? Why...why are you so cold?! Shinobu! Let me go! Darling! Hey, hey, class is starting! Get back in your seats, dammit! Lum... Oh, Rei! You... you morons! This is supposed to be a class period! The famous eight mushrooms are here! What is going on?! I can't teach my class with all this noise! I love the ocean! I love the ocean! Sorry! Sorry! I must've pressed the wrong button! Benten! Oyuki! Ten! Lum... Oh, Rei... you! Don't you know that this is a class period?! Shinobu! SHUT UP! Ahem! Tomorrow, let's all go to the Märchenland together!
