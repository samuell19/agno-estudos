The whole city knows He is a bloody terrorist with beast's blood flowing in him An avaricious 3rd rate criminal He's a bloody killer Idiot! Just shut up You have no idea about the cruelty and injustice he had to face About his scars of betrayal Or the torment of death You don't know who Ashok is Against our country when terrorism raised its ugly head... ...Mumbai police specifically formed a task force, Anti Terrorism Squad, ATS With their brain power and bravery... ...not only did they nab Lions Liberation leader, Durani ...but they also saved all the young students' lives Credit goes to Sanjay Asst Commissioner of police And bomb squad specialist Ashok!

What's the situation? Kind of tensed, sir Same group that blasted the metro has infiltrated here They are holding some foreigners as hostages in that corner building We don't know where they have placed the bombs, sir Hey officer! This building is now under our control I give you an hour's time I want you to release our leader Durani Otherwise repercussions will be disastrous We've informed our senior officers of all your demands First release the hostages What you've seen so far is a small display compared to the final fireworks You'll face 10 times the repercussion for your action very soon Your men and these innocent people will die No tricks Just 1 hour 1 hour only Keep quiet! We cannot release Durani But within the time specified by him... ...we must rescue all the hostages And nab him also Without alerting Durani's men... ...we should find and diffuse the bombs Sir, we've caught Adhil a terrorist from this group - Where? - Come with me, sir I'll gouge your eyes out of their sockets and shove them into your mouth Where is the bomb? Tell me Police are here now Do they think I'm joking or what? Our cause will live Time has come for us to leave Farewell!

I am fine - Are you okay? - Yeah Scoundrels! Sanjay, are you okay? I'm okay Why are you hiding? Coward! Come out Come in front What did you guys think? What do you think sacrifice is? In the 1 hour he specified how many minutes left? Coward! 15 seconds Come out Go...! Move...get up Sanjay Sanjay...? Get up, Sanjay Sanjay...? Open your eyes...Sanjay! I'm scared You'll be fine I'm not scared of death I'm scared I won't see my baby Shut up! Your baby will be born in your lap Get up...up Come Be with me Sanjay...! You are okay Sanjay Parade attention! Raise your gun Fire...! What's this? How did Sanjay die? Ashok, everyone is aware, he died in the Nariman house shoot out He shouldn't have died You know why? He was wearing a sub-standard bullet proof jacket It should have protected him against the onslaught of bullets It didn't He died in front of my eyes I can...understand your feelings You are upset at losing your friend I know how badly...it hurts Who approved this bullet proof jacket? Why? I looked at all the test reports and I was the one who approved That's where the fault lies Sir, we have never been scared of death But that death should be a just one Sanjay's brave-heart act in rescuing the hostages... ...is being applauded by our entire country Don't disgrace the department with unnecessary monologs Yov! Sanjay is dead 3 police officers who were one of us are dead now Why? All because of substandard bullet proof jackets! That's the bloody truth Don't accuse me without proof, Ashok Proof...? Okay, let's make it simple Here's your proof Ashok...! You wanted proof? Why are you terrified? If this jacket is of good quality your life should be intact! What are you doing? You asked me for proof, right? Here's your proof ASHOK...! Aaaaaargh! This is your proof Sanjay's jacket will speak for him I won't spare a single soul behind this scam Why did you want to see me urgently? Sir, Sanjay was wearing a substandard bullet proof jacket That's why 3 ATS officers died You suddenly come to me and tarnish the image of your own men I have proof, sir Here's the lab report Manik Verma is the one who supplied the jackets When tested, the bullets pierced through the vests But ruling it out as unfair range... ...joint commissioner Milind has sanctioned it You're complaining like a school kid Let's ask the teacher! Milind, he has brought some records questioning your approval Should this even reach my ears? - You deal with it - Sorry, sir Ashok, we belong to 1 single family We should stick to each other like glue Didn't I tell you so? 3 officers died Aren't they part of our family? Hey...what did you say your name was? Ashok...! Look here, Ashok All of us have to die some day They have died wrapped in fame Leave it If you won't get me wrong can I ask you something? What? What's your share in this? Ashok...! Do you realize what you're- What temerity to ask me this? Only lies will be terrified Not truth Those who worked with me as blood brothers... ...were lying dead in a pool of blood If you are also responsible I won't spare you either Is the minister also party to this? Terrible Our channel will never support any wrong-doer But you gave away the only evidence to the minister I have a copy with me I hope you haven't gone to any channel other than Flash TV We shouldn't let this go without taking action Those who are not fit to be here won't exist! Ashok, 1 minute You seem very disturbed these days Something is troubling you What's wrong? What do I say? Do you want me to say Sanjay didn't die...? But he was murdered? I don't...get you, Ashok Sanjay was killed due to greed of some people Due to corruption immersed in the blood of some people Because of this wretched system Sanjay was killed by my own bloody department None of us expected this problem to boomerang A lot of money is involved We've earned 2 billion in just this bullet proof vests deal Our money is safe in Switzerland which no one can lay their hands on Now we should ensure no other problem crops up Not just money, but our respect, prestige, power...all this is involved With a lot of effort, we earned all this over the years The day this is exposed we are all finished You'll all be counting bars in Tihar jail and I'll be visiting you! You want to know something? Sanjay was wearing a substandard bulletproof jacket Who wagged his tail and approved the bones thrown at him? Milind, our joint commissioner of police When I went with proof to the Home minister... ...it dawned on me that dog has been licking the bones too! So what do you want me to say? Maya, I've always handled enemies, even an army of them But I'm learning to tackle traitors now We are doomed if he talks in any other media also He has a copy of documents which will expose all of us We must destroy that first Most important is the jacket Sanjay was wearing that day It shouldn't reach the court as evidence It won't! What nonsense are you all talking? Let me handle him Give me 2 hours I'll finish him We shouldn't act impulsively or rashly Ashok is a fair, just and respected police officer If Ashok takes up a- Why do you keep harping Ashok...Ashok? Ashok! To whomsoever he babbles it shouldn't hold water His fair play, sense of justice etc etc...wipe his slate clean He is here Ashok, they are here to see you Tell me You need to come to the office for an enquiry Enquiry for what? In Sanjay's murder case, Adhil the terrorist... ...whom you bashed up in a frenzy, died in custody You go I'll follow you Ashok, we are here to take you with us I'm sure you know the ATS rules Please cooperate Ashok, what's all this? It is a- Nothing, dad Just an enquiry I stand before you with my head bowed in shame Assistant commissioner Ashok from our department has links with terrorists All lies Ashok is innocent This is a well-planned conspiracy When Adhil the terrorist was willing to confess... ...Ashok beat him up and brutally murdered him For sacrificing our life and saving people's lives... ...this is the gift Govt has presented us with But we won't be quiet We'll bring out the ugly truth Durani, in our custody, leader of Lions liberation group... ...has given his testimony about Ashok in court Govt. thinks Rs 500000 and a medal is sufficient But medal and money can't justify the pain Home minister takes responsibility for this He feels it He wants to compensate I don't understand How many months? 8 months Just 1 month more This is your future Rather than brood over the past... ...to think of the future is a sign of intelligence Can you stop beating around the bush and come to the point? Suppose I deposit 20 million in the bank for your baby... ...the interest will accumulate You can raise your child without being dependent on anyone Your child can choose the degree or diploma he or she wishes You don't have to worry about my child's future I know how to raise my child She's emotionally upset You try and advise her Ashok was wrong to think you will help us I am helping you We don't need your help Are you trying to bargain with us? 1 more minute here and you overstay your welcome Get out! You are making a huge mistake GO Isn't she that TV anchor? - Rane-ji - Yes, Ramya You know very well no one can negotiate better than me Even I couldn't strike a deal Still the deed will be done Ashok...! Aaaaaargh! Who the hell are all of you? Let go of Nandhini What are you doing? Mango...! Don't do anything to her If you want her to live... ...all of you, quietly drink this poison and rest in peace! Don't fall for his threat, please You barged in like a drove of pigs to hit us women! Aren't you ashamed to call yourselves men? No, don't do Let her go I'll drink it Drink! Daaaaad...don't! Maaaaa...noooooo!! What happened? The 2 oldies will die soon The girl has also passed out What will she do being the lone survivor? Let's send her also along with them Let go of me My baby will die My baby will die Pleaaaase! My baby...please! No...please don't do this How many times I told you we belong to 1 family? You didn't listen Now I have no other option but to kill you, Ashok 2 wrongs can never be right History has never written it so (mocking laughter) Why are you laughing? I am happy Happy you'll die? Happy my suspicions have been proved right Get up Lift him up First your relatives died Then your respect Now you'll die like an orphan I'm not scared of death But each one of you will be scared to death very soon I guarantee you that Son of a mongrel! Aiyo...! Dad Sister Get up 'To tell the world about this barbaric act, I was fighting death' Ashok rose from the brink of death to fight for injustice Branded as country's traitor is more cruel than death Politics is power Power creates injustice Ashok wanted to destroy this He wanted to deprive them of ill-gotten wealth hoarded from... ...innocent people by sucking their blood and sweat Sanjay was my whole world Ashok felt the same way too Sanjay looked up to Ashok as a role model Ashok carries Sanjay's death as a deep seated scar in his heart This is not revenge It's an ethical revolt He is at war I feel terrible about all that I did I'm sorry, Maya Now I realize why Ashok behaved the way he did I'm sorry about Sanjay Oh my God! Baby...why are you crying now? We are very sorry, Maya We blundered big time, baby We didn't, baby They are honest, good people just the way you thought - Please listen to me - It's okay, Arjun I know you won't help after all that's happened Take care of Anita This is what I don't like in you You'll decide I should help Then you'll yourself make up your mind I won't I've messed up a lot without my knowledge I'll set it right myself I want to right the wrong Oh! How sweet! I'm not mourning the death of a 45 year long friendship It's the death of my shadow I can't just weep for 2 days and carry on with my life I know how much Mr Sharma's death would've affected you, sir We've got Ashok He's in our custody Ashok Kumar Bomb squad specialist Your records are impeccable How did you suddenly change over from cop to a cruel terrorist? You resemble someone who was very close to me I wanted to tell you this in the hospital lift that day Wrong timing You've been part of ATS You know how the interrogation works So...talk Isn't your wife pregnant? Which month is she into now? Are you threatening me? Don't be silly! I casually asked Don't try all these 'Smart Ashok' games with me! I know how to make you talk Don't waste your time I'll leave this place in the next 5 minutes It won't happen when I am here Sir, JCP Milind has come to see you Did he tell you anything? Not yet, sir But I'll make him talk soon - Good work, Prakash - Thank you, sir I'll take over from here I'm half way through I'll interrogate him You don't worry I have lots to ask hi- Prakash! I'm your chief From this minute onwards, Ashok is my responsibility Didn't I tell you, Prakash? I'd be leaving within the next 5 minutes from here? Hold tight! Ashok, killing me won't get you anywhere They won't spare your life One who is scared of death will die everyday One who isn't scared of anything will die only once in his lifetime! The D-day doesn't matter when! Sorry, I misunderstood you I'll do everything you asked me to Sorry, man Sorry, chief I hope I can call you 'chief'? Your Ashok has killed our senior officer in the middle of the road You are like family to him and worked for him for 20 years You'll know his whereabouts and his strategies definitely This is the only way you can save your skin Sir...? Turn into an approver I'll release you Let me give you a better choice Why don't you all own up to all your mistakes and turn approvers? Ashok will spare you And you don't have to hunt him down How's my idea?
