"Search not, for He is among us." So they drill a hole through your shinbone. Right here. About this size. And it goes straight through the bone. Then they take a thin, perforated silver pipe. And they stick it right through the hole. In at this side and out at the other. And then they blow esoteric smoke through the pipe. It goes right through the perforation... ...and goes straight to your bone marrow. Really? -Yeah. And this creates an immediate expansion of consciousness. It's supposed to be an incredible experience. And where do they do this? -In our communes in America. JESUS IS A PALESTINIAN The Kahn... the Kahn! The Kahn Guru is coming! He's coming! Mustafa, come. Get those cows out of the way. Hurry! Come on, now! Line up neatly. Come on! Ramses, put the pig down. Did you allow this again? -What do you mean 'again'? Each time I come here for the initiations, there's a problem. I thought that a little bit of change... No, no, no. Read the texts, man. You know very well what it says there. No rings through the nipples. So you have nipple rings, Ramses. That means you can kiss your big initiation goodbye. Because I'm the big Kahn Guru. And I fed the holy pig to my own foreskin. Xerxes, listen to me. If Adi Da Khan hears you talk like this... ...he'll pull me up for it. So you'd better watch your tongue. And Ramses, he wants to talk to you later about your initiation. How's his detachment going? It's going quite well. I believe Ramses hasn't been in touch with his parents for years. Did he join you from his own initiative? More or less, yes. As a child, Ramses has been through some rough times. As an adolescent, he lived on the streets for a while. He sniffed so much glue... ...that his nasal septum started to disappear. Then he joined the Calvary Preachers. They forced him to self-chastise so he could cleanse himself. Ramses, turn around, please. Fortunately, we were able to get him out of there just in time. That's around eight years ago, now. Has he been in the forbidden zone yet? What's he asking? How should I put it? Adi Da Khan wants to know... He wants to know if you ever fucked. Not really. What do you mean, not really? I just haven't. No, he's never been in the forbidden zone. It's ok. You'll be initiated tomorrow. Ramses. Hi. Do you know if Alfred lives here? Make sure she disappears. Unfortunately, women aren't allowed here. But I'm looking for my brother Alfred. Do you know where he is? No, there's no Alfred here. And I must ask you to leave. Hey, wait a minute. What do you think you're doing? Man, get lost. I can see by your stupid face you're lying. I didn't come here for fun. Hold it well. And hit hard, near the head. It's still alive! If it doesn't work... ...always put the animal out of its misery first. Every second you wait, part of your shakras is lost. Alfred? Don't you recognize me? It's me, Natasja. Natasja? Yes. My name is Ramses now. Ramses? Yes. You're so big. Yes, what did you expect? Why do you look like an idiot? Like an idiot? What are you doing here? Daddy is dying. He wants to see you one last time. At the hospital they say it could be a matter of days. I'm by car, so you can come with me right away. I'm not allowed to leave. What do you mean, not allowed? Daddy is dying. He wants to talk to you one last time. Ok, then. But I have to talk to the Kahn Guru first. Adi Da Kahn thinks that a visit to your father... ...could jeopardise harmony in our commune. And your detachment process might suffer. Besides, you've just been initiated. I don't think it's a good idea. But he's my father. If I don't go to Amsterdam now, I'll never see him again. He can go, but on one condition. He says he needs you here for the bone marrow experiment... ...and that has to take place before Orion shifts out of the Aquarius zenith. That's why he wants you to take an oath. You must swear you'll come back straight after your father's death. Yes, of course. I understand. Thank you. You know what happens if you break your oath. Yes, I know. -Tell me. I'll be cast out and my future will be grim. Exactly. Do what he does. Jesus, that guy with the glasses is a sneaky asshole! Who, our commune leader? How can you stay with those people? He's just a bit nervous because the Kahn Guru is there. That creepy fakir with the dirty white beard? Is that the kangaroo? No, the Kahn Guru. Yes, kangaroo. No, the Kahn Guru. That's what I said. No, you said kangaroo. I always used to call the Kahn Guru Skippy. But our commune leader doesn't allow that anymore. Quiet. What's wrong? There's something wrong with my boot. I don't hear a thing. Alfred! Did you put it in there? His name's Mustafa. You've got to be kidding! Mustafa always comes with me. No, out of the question, Alfred. We're returning the pig right away. Then I'll stay too. I can't show up at home with a pig. If Mustafa can't come, I won't either. How's mom? She still lives in Haarlem. Do you see her often? Hardly. After her divorce, she married this dufus. So I moved out. And she never visits daddy in hospital anymore. Hello daddy. Daddy, I found Alfred. -Ramses. Daddy, Alfred's here. -Ramses. Why is he hanging like that? If they put him straight, his brain doesn't get enough blood... ...and he'd get paralysed. Can he see us? -I don't know. I don't know what's wrong with him. Daddy? Daddy? Stay here. I'll go and get somebody. Daddy? Are you looking for somebody? -No, I'm not. Alfred, listen. -Ramses. Ramses, I just talked to that nurse and she says... ...daddy hasn't been responding to anything since this morning. How do you mean? She says he can't hear us or see us. What if you would operate on him? That would be useless. His fingers and toes are dying already. So maybe ask yourself whether he should continue to live like this. I don't think daddy would want that. -What do you mean? Did he say that? He's been hanging there for so long. I can't handle it anymore. Can't handle it? It's your own father. I don't want him to suffer any longer, upside down like that. Listen to the doctor. He won't get better. Is there no chance he'll regain consciousness? He's not been responding to anything for four months now. Four months? So the chance is minute. What do you mean, four months? Your father hasn't spoken in four months. And you said you talked to him the day before yesterday. Hey, didn't you say that? I'm sorry, Ramses. Can somebody tell me what's happening here? I was afraid you wouldn't come with me. But why did I have to come to Amsterdam? We need your signature. I'm sorry I lied, but I can't take a decision without you. And why did you tell me he wanted to talk to me? He did want that. Fine, I'm not talking to you and I stay in Amsterdam until I talk to him. It's here, isn't it? -Yes. Thanks. I'm going to sleep. Can't I come in? No, it's too late. Just for a drink. Are you coming out? -Just come in. Are you getting up too? Lonneke, this is Ramses. Ramses, that's Lonneke. Hi. -Hi. Is he yours? -His name is Mustafa. Can I pick him up? Come on, Ramses. We're going. Is your ass clean? Natasja speaking. Yes, he's here. Just a moment. It's for you. Ramses speaking. Oh, it's you. I've been to the hospital yesterday... ...but we're afraid I was too late. Ramses was probably too late. But that means you can come back quickly. Come back? Another couple of days, I think. Ok, yes, bye. Do you have to go back. -No. The Kahn Guru is worried. Kangaroo? -Kahn Guru. The pirates all had earrings so they could see further over the sea. It works the same as needles in Chinese acupuncture. They pierce them in your earlobes when you have bad eyesight. Because the earlobe is connected to the eye lens by a meridian. Sure. And does my nose ring have a therapeutic effect? Yes, a ring in your nose stimulates a nerve that boosts a woman's fertility. Really, that's why India is so densely populated. Because all Hindu women have a ring in their nose. That's nonsense. Who told you that? It's not nonsense, really. Each piece of metal is a mini satellite dish that leads... ...positive radiation from the cosmos directly to your body. The wrought-iron pins that Jesus was nailed to the cross with... ...you know what they were? Huge piercings that enabled him to communicate with his father... ...in heaven. Shit, fucking animal. I'm not going to clean this up. You can do it. Look. Ramses. Right, you're not talking to me. Man, you're childish. It looks like a red luminous cross on an apartment building. I think I know what that is. -Yes? What? It's the landing-strip for Jesus. -For Jesus? It's true. That's the Bijlmer over there. It was on TV the other day. There's a nut there who says Jesus comes in the year 2000. A landing-strip for Jesus in the Bijlmer? Wow, you're talking to me. That's great. Ramses, were you serious when you said... ...you wanted to stay here until daddy talks again? Maybe. I don't want to keep him hanging any longer in that hospital. We really have to do something. With this official statement you, as only close relatives... ...can give permission to end his suffering. Are you sure? -No. Ramses... -I can't decide this like that. Our house is small enough as it is. And you have to go back to Limburg. That has nothing to do with it. Ramses, it's all taking way too long. Something has to happen. I haven't even talked to him. How do I know what to decide for him? Dear Ramses, you will make that decision anyway... ...when you see how more and more of his body parts die off. Yes, maybe you're right. -Yes? Daddy has been in pain, Ramses. For years. And when he can finally get relief, you ruin it. You never visited him once and now his life is so important to you. You just don't get it. Explain it to me then. And don't tell me it has to do with what... ...those fakirs in Limburg taught you about life and death. Because I don't buy that. I knew you'd have nothing to say. Lonneke speaking. Yes, he's here. One moment. It's for you. Ramses. No, it's going to take a while. How should I know why? No, we agreed I'd stay until he died. Yes, but now you have to come back. Orion won't wait for us. End of discussion. No, Gengis won't be of any help. Because he hasn't been initiated. Let Osiris talk to him. Ramses, Osiris here. Why aren't you coming back, man? We're doing a great experiment here. What did they say? I think he hung up. -Yes, I heard that. What is it? Bad luck for the mice. Lonneke, Lonneke, relax. Stop that, you nut. It's dead. Daddy? I don't think you can hear me, but... ...I'm afraid I took the wrong decision for you yesterday and... ...I don't know what to do now. Daddy? Daddy? Is that you, son? How are you? Jesus, you look terrible. Wait, daddy, I'll be right back. No, no, don't. Come here. I don't see any difference. He looked at me. He said I look terrible. Look who's talking. -Really, he talked to me. Sir, can you hear me? Have some strong coffee with us. And then you go home. After all those years, you're still telling on people. But they want to put you down. I don't care what they want. How are you? Not bad. I'm sorry I didn't visit you for so long. Am I a weak person because I'm a believer? Weak? I've been hanging here for quite a while, doing penance. What do you mean? You know very well what I mean. -No. I ruined everything for you and Natasja. Or you would never have left me. But you have to help me. I want to meet Him and tell Him that I really tried... ...to be a better person. Who? Who do you want to meet? In this ward, there are even people who get operations... ...so they can experience it all. There's even somebody... ...who wants to be frozen. "I'll be frozen and I'll wait for the Messiah to defrost me." You mean the man with the landing-strip in the Bijlmer? Landing-strip in the Bijlmer? -Yes. What are you talking about? I'm talking about the Messiah. So am I. Which Messiah are you talking about then? I don't know. So you haven't talked to anybody for four months? No, if people don't take me seriously, I don't take them seriously either. I have to tell Natasja that you're fooling them. They want to let you die. Out of the question. You have to help me. Take me to the Messiah. Once you know when he returns and where. Do you believe in that Messiah? No. You? -No. But if your father believes in him, you can help him. Yes, maybe. Why don't you ask the man from the landing-strip to see your father? Nah, I don't know if I should see him. It sounds ridiculous. I'd like to meet that weirdo. Shall I go with you? Imagine I don't say anything to Natasja. Then they'll send my dad into the after life. And nobody will know what was wrong with him. Yes, I understand that. Then why do you say I shouldn't tell Natasja? I just know she doesn't want to believe it. What? -About your father. Why? I think she wants to get rid of you. Get rid of me? What does that have to do with anything? Don't you understand? -No. Just tell me. -Tell you what? What you were about to tell me. Some things are... a bit embarrassing to say. But I should know why she doesn't want me to stay. Yes, you should. -Well then. She says you want to stay here for me. For you? -Yes, for me. Where did you get that idea? -It's her idea. Don't act as if I came up with that. -No. Do you understand why she never visited daddy? She lives so close. It doesn't surprise me. -Why not? Natasja doesn't really care about anybody. She doesn't need anybody and she just does her own thing. But aren't you friends? I don't think she sees it like that. Why are you living together then? Because I feel safe with her. Do you think we can get closer? -I don't know. And the last time you said women can be dominant over men sometimes. Barbara? I want you to say something about yourself. I'd like to know why you said that, because I thought about it a lot. No, Barbara, about yourself. Not what others said in the past. You, yourself, right now. Good. How do you feel now? I don't know. Relieved. Lighter. I feel like I see things lighter lately. And I'm quite happy I met you. -Good. And that I can be with you. -That's beautiful. Those are beautiful words. Oh, yes, your attention please for this little book. You probably all read The Celestine Prophecy by James Redfield. A sequel now has been published, called: The Palestine Prophecy. It explains why the Messiah will return in 2000, as a Palestinian. Sounds illogical, but it's not. So far, the Jews had the honour of providing the Messiah. But now the Palestinians finally have their turn... ...to give their chosen world teacher to humanity. Ok, enough about that. Read the book for yourselves. You can buy it for 50 guilders. But who is this Rashid? He has an open fontanel and through it... ...he communicates with the Messiah. To prepare us for His return. And he really thinks He'll come to the Bijlmer? Of course, isn't this the stable of the Netherlands? This is where all the people go for whom there's no room in the inn. The woman you talked to outside, had this balm put on her legs. And now she can push her own wheelchair. I don't know what's wrong with his father... ...but if you tell him Rashid radiated this balm himself... ...he'll easily make it to the Great Coming. Can't the Messiah go to his father, after he returns? You're too impatient, girl. First, his father will have to survive until the big moment. Apply that balm first and then we'll take it from there. Where do I apply it? Apply it where your father says he needs it. But how can my father know that? He'll know. Trust me. That's 25 guilders. -25 guilders? Yes. Why do you return the tin? I'm not going to pay 25 guilders for this nonsense. Of course it's nonsense, but what counts is that your father believes it. If he believes in it, it will work. Let me smell it first. You smell it. It smells of fish or something. It'll be ok. Just start. Come on now. -I'm not sure where to put it. Didn't he tell you? -He said you would know. Put it all over me, then. All over? -Yes. So she asks: Did you ever go down on a girl? How did it go? Do I have to say that here? Can't you just say whether you applied the balm? Guys, what are you talking about? Lubricant. So this is your brother Alfred. -No, his name's Ramses. Ramses? -Yes, his name's Ramses. Hi. Ramses, the pig man. Nice to meet you. I'm Bob. I want to know when you were last penetrated by a man. Just curious. Or can't the little pig man hear that? I went to see dad. -So what? And you throw a party in the meantime? Yes, your stupid decisions are not going to ruin my life. And I'm not going to the hospital anymore. It makes me sick. Must be because you went so often, the past couple of years. Who told you that? -You'll never guess. I don't think I need to know that. And if you don't like it here, you can go back to Limburg. A bit higher. Like this? -Yes, that's good. So how did it go? I applied all of it and afterwards he felt a lot better. See? I told you. -Yes. It's for you. The kangaroo. But where are you? Stop that stupid laughing. Guys, stop that. -Don't do that. Don't do that. This is not funny. -Stop it. You scare him. Jesus, fuck off, Roy. I've had enough, Ramses. -They put Mustafa on the cupboard. Go to dad's house with that smelly pig. Bye. -Bye. Why can't Ramses stay here? Get in. Because he's driving me nuts. As long as he can follow you around with a hard-on... ...he'll never go back to Limburg. He hasn't touched me, you know. -Yeah, right. He wants the same thing as all the other guys. But you're seeing Bob yourself. Bob? Bob? What does Bob have to do with anything? This is the key. Daddy's clothes are in the wardrobe. Natasja? -Yes? I wanted to talk to you about daddy. -Ok, go ahead. I talked to him. -To the doctor, you mean. No, to daddy. Yeah, right, you talked to daddy. I talked to the doctor and he's still waiting for your signature. You're not listening, are you? Do you have any idea what it costs to keep him alive like this? Why don't you sell this house if you need money? I don't need money. That's not the point. Then what is the point? -Daddy, of course. Natasja? -Yes. Do you ever listen to people? -Yes. Do you ever listen to Lonneke? No, Lonneke listens to me. Why is that? Because she has to be careful about her body. She tends to forget that. Of course, a loser like you doesn't understand that. The other tin is empty. Does everybody need balm now? Rashid discovered another synchronicity in the... ...calendars of the Assyrians, the Mesopotamians... ...the Sumerians and the Hittites. He's been calculating all night and came to the conclusion... ...that the Messiah will be coming in three days. In three days? Wasn't it supposed to take exactly 2000 years? Yes, but Jesus wasn't born exactly in the year 0. So the year 2000 isn't very absolute, says Rashid. Hello, Mustafa. Daddy is home again. Find daddy in the dark. Of course, what's happening to your father is terrible. But we really can't continue without you. Sit down. Lonneke. Hey, Lonneke. What are you doing here? Can I come in? What's wrong? They want to hollow me out. Don't you think they'll find you here too? Not while Natasja's here. Is she already asleep? No, she's still washing old people. I hope she'll be back quickly. But aren't you afraid she'll kick you out? Yes, I am. Better stay with me tonight then. I used to look like a little boy. My mother wanted that. My hair had to be short, because that was easier, she said. I also wanted cute lace stockings... ...with pretty shoes. But I had to wear big leather boys' shoes... ...because that was better for my feet. So everybody thought I was a boy. I hated that. I hated that so much. When my mother was gone, I went to the other extreme. And your father? What did he say? My father said he was the only man who thought I was beautiful. So it didn't matter how I looked. Do you still see him? -No, fortunately not. And what did you mean... your mother was gone? Ramses? What does a belly button piercing do? Belly button? -Yes. It relaxes the anus muscle. -Really? Yes. -Do you have to shit more often? No, but the Chinese used it for people with bowel problems. Do you have a needle? -Yes. Yes, that will work. Are you ready? -Yes. There it goes. Is it working? -Yes, it's going well. Just a little bit more. Oh, you were already asleep. -No, I wasn't. Oh, ok, sorry. -Goodnight. Goodnight. Ok, it's done. What shall we put in? One of yours? That one. -No, not this one. Why not? If I remove this one, I get kidney stones. Kidney stones? -Yes. I'll get this one. Beautiful, but it hurts a bit. What's this? Who is it? Ramses isn't here anymore. He sleeps somewhere else. Are you sure? -Yes, Ali Baba. Now get lost with your fakirs. Do you know what time it is? I got a fright in my dream. Did I wake you? No, I wasn't asleep yet. And then what happened? Then nothing happened. -Nothing? She said I was the only guy who didn't always talk about sex. Sex? And then you went to sleep? -Yes. Why? -I was scared. You were scared? -Yes. Of what? I don't know. You're having doubts. Yes, maybe I do. Doubt is good. You have to be careful. When I saw her the day before yesterday... ...I noticed she looked rather scandalous. Don't you agree? Yes... yes. And the only power many women have, is sexual attraction. That gets almost every man down. But what's tricky with some women... ...is that they also try to look good when they already have a partner. So don't think they're horny or are looking for a lover. They do that because they have this insatiable hunger... ...for being desired by the other sex. Power, in other words. But I don't think Lonneke has a partner. No? Are you sure? Yes. -Well, then it's clear. What? -That's she's interested in you. No, I can't imagine she's interested in me. Why not? I notice she keeps me at a distance. Don't you understand? You're talking nonsense. It's not nonsense. Look at me. I have this stupid hair and this fucking iron in my face. How would you feel, laying next to a girl like this. Don't be so naive, man. But what should I do now? A mussel opens up in boiling water. Where were you? What have you done now? Finished? -Yes. And those rings? Do they have to come out? Yes, they must come out too. Sure? -Sure. Not that one. -Don't move. If I remove that one, I get a runny nose. Nonsense, I don't have a runny nose either. You look much better like this. Ramses speaking. Yes? Yes, I understand. What is it? My father stopped breathing. So if you stop that machine, he'll die? Yes, we're afraid so. But who decided to put him on that machine? That's not a decision. It speaks for itself. But what's the point of keeping him alive with a stupid machine? What else could we have done? Turn the machine off and wait until he dies peacefully. Then he can go back to Limburg... ...and this fucking mess is finally over. And why can't we talk to our own doctor? Doctor Smulders has been suspended. Why, if I may ask? Because doctor Smulders is a creepy body snatcher. Isn't there anything you can do to make my father breathe again? No, Ramses. We could operate on him. Yes, yes, operate. -Yeah right, no way. But we'd have to put him flat and he might get paralysed. But would he be able to talk again? I thought he wasn't able to do that anymore. Do it. -No, don't do it. It's your choice. It's what daddy wants. -Right, he likes hanging upside down. Madam, I think we have to respect your brother's opinion. Yeah, sure. Drop dead with your fucking operations. Hi. -Hi. Natasja's furious. What happened? They're going to operate on daddy. Promise me one thing, ok? -What's that? That we do everything exactly the way I want it, ok? Yes, if that's what you want. Stop. Turn around. What's that? -What? On your back here. You mean those stripes? I once fell through a glass door. Come... take off my panties. Like this? Ok, now you. Jesus, what's that? Can that thing come off? No, it shouldn't. Ok, are you ready? Stop, stop, my skin. Ok, there we go. That's it. God knows what he's doing there. We can hardly storm in and drag him out. Ramses, Ramses, wait a moment. -What's wrong? I'm afraid. -Me too. Promise you'll be very careful? - Yes, of course. Try it again. Careful. No, Ramses, stop. But it fits, doesn't it? Yes. -What's wrong then? I'm scared to do it. You mean you never did it before? I'm sorry, Ramses. I just don't want it. Ramses. Yes, what do you want? He shaved off all his hair. Come down for a moment, man. No. -Ramses, come on now. You're driving me nuts. How long are you going to follow me? We still recognise you, you know. And we really need you tonight. If the heavenly bodies shift any more, it will be useless. We'd have to wait for another six years. What did he say? He wants you to come before you get deprogrammed any further. I'm not coming and you know it. I'll stay here as long as my father's alive. That was the deal. Now get lost. Mustafa, come here. Get the unfaithful. Let go of the door... my shoulder... You let go first. Let go, guys, let go. Put him in the car. Look. His ring is gone. What? -He removed the safety ring. Are you serious? -Really, I saw it too. His safety ring is gone. Die in your dirty whorehouse, you filthy bastard. What's he saying? I think you better go inside. Come, we're going back home. I want to know why you removed my ring. I want to go home. You already knew you didn't want to do it with me, didn't you? Oh, no. He broke his back. -Should I call? No... we can't let him suffer unnecessarily. What are you going to do? Farewell, dear Mustafa. Yes... all the way... careful... push. I want to know what it means, what you said to me yesterday... ...about mussels opening up in boiling water. Are you going to give us a hand or what? No. I want to know what you meant. No, Ramses. Talk about yourself. Not about what others said. You, right now. How do you feel? -Bad. Ramses, we have no time for your whining. Help us or go home. She made a fool of me last night. In front of all my friends. Who? That girl, or have you forgotten already? If you had given her a bit of self confidence... ...you wouldn't be babbling now. -I'm not babbling. Yes, you are babbling. I just feel like shit. Because you're a coward. You don't have any balls. I can't help that. I was born that way. Don't make excuses, man. You should do what you want to do. If you do that, you'll succeed. I don't know where Ramses is. When I woke up, he was gone. He promised to come see me... ...to apply the balm. Shall I do it then? -Yes. Here? -Yes. Like this? Did that boy make any arrangements? What do you mean? I mean, are they going to pick me up... ...when I go to the apartment building in the Bijlmer, tomorrow? Ok, keep it coming. A bit more on the right. Come up with that thing. Pull it up. If you can get a cross up here... ...can't you hoist Ramses' father up with all his hospital stuff? Can't Ramses arrange transport himself? I don't know what he's doing. Relax, I'm coming. I've come to continue where we left off last night. We've come in the name of the Messiah. Yes. Ramses, I can't do it. -Yes, you can. Come on. Ramses, stop it now. What are you doing? Ramses. -Just wait. Quiet. -Ramses, I don't want this. Yes, you do. -Ramses, I really don't want it. Yes, come on. We're going to do it. Ramses, I don't... Can you feel it? It's coming. I think it's coming. What's wrong? What's wrong? Stay here. Lonneke? Lonneke, what's wrong? What have you done? Lonneke? What are you doing here? God, Lonneke, not again. Hush, hush. You had your hands on her, didn't you? Idiot. We're from the Sceptical Foundation. We very critically investigate parapsychological phenomena... ...and pseudo science. Where's Rashid? Rashid's fontanel is about to open. Rashid, listen to me. It went all wrong. Rashid... you have to help me. Listen to me. He can't. Rashid, please listen to me. Please, help me. Who arranged all this? Don't you understand you can't do this? Because he's your brother, that's why. He's not from here. If it had been a local boy, it would have been perfect. But it happens to be Ramses, your brother. That's not the point. The point is you've got a bandaged arm again. And I can clean up after you again. I've had enough. What do you have to clean up? Ramses is a follower, a weakling. He's no good for you. Why do you think they put him in that cult? I decide who I see and who I don't. That's what you said last time. And who can clean up the shit? Lon, you can't go with him. They don't want women there. Who says he's going back? He belongs in that convent, you hear? Let go of my arm. Natasja speaking. Yes, that's correct. How should I know that? No. I've got a doctor here who says my father disappeared from hospital. Do you know anything about that? I think they're in the Bijlmer. There He is. There He is. -Yes, I see him. GO, JESUS! Those crosses, David. What do those crosses mean? The start, David, the start. I'm putting it on the ground. Samuel, this is the fucking end of the strip. My fontanel has opened. The Holy Spirit has descended into me. The new Messiah has come in the form of a Palestinian. He stands here to deliver you from the Big Apocalypse. Lord... Lord... Lord. Deliver me from my sins. Untie him. What's he saying? I don't have a clue. The Messiah says this man must be put on his feet. Lord, Lord, deliver me from my sins. Do you feel my power? It will take away your sins. Ramses, what are you doing? His redemption is nigh. This is what daddy wanted. Oh yeah, is this what he wanted? Is this what he wanted? Hush, hush, take it easy. Ramses, for God's sake, do something. Rashid is in a permanent state of astral projection. What are you going to do? We should have put him upside down. That's better for him. Ok, drive. Drive! -Ramses, I can't do it. Do what? -We're not taking him back. What do you mean? He has to go to hospital. I'm not taking him there. What do you want then? I don't know, but I didn't take him out of there... ...so I don't have to take him back. But we have to help him. They can't help him there. Yes, they can help him. Only if you sign. -I won't sign. Get out. -No. Get out. -No. Let me go, idiot. And stay there, bitch. Ramses, you don't know how to drive. Ramses... Ramses. -Tell me how this thing works. Daddy's gone. Take it easy. Take it easy. Lord... Lord... deliver me. Don't make this take any longer. -Take it easy. Lord... Lord... I can't take it any longer. Lord... Lord... Ramses, you're not leaving us alone. Damn. Lord, Lord, deliver me. Lord... Lord... Farewell, dear daddy. Damn. Better look away. What are you going to do? Lord, I'm coming. I'm coming. What are you going to do now? Adi Da Kahn wants to be sure our commune is really your own choice... ...otherwise you'd better leave. But can't I just stay here? Yes, you can. What's the problem then? The problem is someone has been waiting here for you. I thought you didn't want to see me anymore. I thought you were already here. Where were you last night then? Travelling with daddy. -Really? I kind of asked for it that she bosses me around. But I shouldn't go straight to the next person who... ...also keeps an eye on me. Do I keep an eye on you? No... no. But I should live on my own for a while. Or else, in 10 years, I still won't know if I can look after myself. Maybe I should go before I cause more trouble for you. I'm sorry. How did she get here? Did she come to say goodbye? Well, never mind. I think I should go too, right? Hey, are you ok? All the best, Ramses. Do you want to get in? No thanks, I'll walk.
