Oh, the moon is watching over me. "Midori - The Camellia Girl" Midori: Risa Nakamura Adapted from "Shojo Tsubaki" by Suehiro Maruo Wonder Masamitsu: Shunsuke Kazama Music: Hitomi Kuroishi Written and Directed by TORICO I am a 14 year old girl. My dad left home 3 years ago, leaving my mom and I alone. Then my mom died, and I had nowhere to go. I had no choice but to join the circus when a man lured me to his custody. I dream of becoming an actress one day, but all I do is my given chores. It's so hard that I feel like dying. I'm not even going to school now. I worry about my future that I can't sleep, too. What should I do with my life? Mom... Here, have this. See you, stay put! Midori... How sweet of you. Man, this is good. It's been months since we last had meat. Don't be shy and have some, Midori. It's good. Like it, Midori? Yes, very much. Where did you get the money to buy meat? I didn't buy it. No one sells dog meat. DOG? It's still good though. What's wrong, Midori? She's crying 'cause it's so good! You must have had a tough life. It's a dog! Dog! I want to go home... Won't you have some flowers Magnolia in bloom is a dream Sunflower is a queen I have trumpet creepers and waxyleaf nightshades too I am a lost flower My home afar is on fire I am a ripe camellia with a blind black dog in my mouth My mom... She's sick. My dad... He left. Sir with a bowler hat, any flowers for you? I've got so many leftovers today. But these are origami flowers. Girl, I can buy all that for you. Come to me whenever you're in trouble. There are many scary men roaming around here. Hurry home, won't you now. Oh, the moon! It is watching over me. Poh! Poh! What are you poh-ing for? Snap out of it, will you? Watching trains all day... You want to return to Tokyo that bad? But you have nowhere else to go, darlin'. Midori looks curious. Join us, Midori. Stop it, she's just a kid. I can give you twice the fun. Your dick is small compared to the rest of you. Here, let me lick your eyeball... You bogus circus! Get out of our town! Aren't you cold? No! Go away! I'm cold and I can't sleep, too. Let's warm up together. No, I hate you! You smell weird! Stop that bullshit. You're not a virgin, right? Good, that went well. It's freezing... Whatcha looking at? At least let my head be in another world Daddy? Daddy? Daddy... Daddy! Daddy, help! Help me, daddy! Suffer! Suffer! No one will help you. Become a snake! Why should you stay human and be happy at the same time! You've got a fever so you can stay in bed today. Damn it. We're in the red big time. Oh come on, boss. Do something. When are we going to get our pay? Don't ask me. I'm as buggered as you are. You think you can get away with that!? It's been like this for 3 months though. Think of something. Hey... Can't you lend me some money? Just a little bit. Huh, you friggin' fairy! We'll starve to death. Got to get some other job and somehow make a living. We should get rid of useless members. Yeah, maybe you two will be sold for good. I heard that boss has recruited someone new. A guy who uses Western magic. Fine with me but he must be real stupid to come to this dumpster. Midori! Go elsewhere and sleep. We don't want your cold. Don't cough, you'll give us your cold. Just make a move. Maybe Midori is the cause of our downfall. We've been out of luck ever since she came. I'm home. Mom, I sold all the flowers. How are you feeling, mom? I'll make you some egg soup tonight. Maybe I can go to the next school trip. A nice man told me to visit him whenever I'm in trouble. And he... Mom! Mom! Mom... Did you hear? I sure did. A rat was squeaking in the coffin. It must have been inside her...you know. I was wondering about her moans during the day. Bedridden and raped by a rat. Helpless. She apparently looked hideous. (singing) Excuse me. Is there Akaneko Circus around here? This way. Careful. Master, you have arrived early. I'm sorry but I was busy with money gathering. It's quite nice and warm inside. I'm Wonder Masamitsu, nice to meet you. This way, Master. Have some tea. Push! This is the consequence of your stinginess. Shut up and push! At least we can be on tour. Midori, come and help. What a beautiful mirror. It's my mother's memento. That must've been hard for you. I'll be here to protect you from now on. Look. How beautiful. Mr. Wonder? Mr. Wonder, where are you? I'm here. Come this way. No, wait! Hold on! We can accommodate you all. Just wait a while. Okay, okay, pay later. Pay later! Hey, don't push! I can't move! Let me through! Wait and see him hit the target. Boring! Show us Wonder Masamitsu! Please don't! Master! Get on stage now! Master! Wait. I need an assistant. Then Kanabun can... Midori? But she's terrible on stage. Will you do it? Thanks for waiting! She's my assistant, Midori. Why is he in the spotlight? It's not fair. How on earth? Beats me every time. It's like there's no... trick. Master! Thank you for everything. Mm-hmm. Hey, just bring him some tea! Don't mind me. Bring Midori some hot milk. I was able to do a good job tonight with your help, Midori. Thank you. Assisting what? She was just standing there. Where's the milk? Coming soon. Hey. Me? Let's make this circus bigger. Much, much bigger. Thank you. My life was tough before you came. My mom died and the circus members all bullied me. Your hardships are now all over, Midori. You'll be fine if you stay with me. I hope it won't snow any more. Indeed. - Good? - Yes. Why can you go in and out of the bottle? That's because... Midori, I want to give you something. Close your eyes. Three, two, one... Wow! Look at her. She's over the moon. Hey, have you done the washing? There's no time to look in your mirror. I know! I was just going to do it. Hey Talking back now, are you? That's not very charming! Don't mess my hair, you mummified asshole! You need some scolding. Here. Let me go, stupid! Who do you think is looking after you? If my man learns of this... Your man, is he now? Owww... What's the fun? Come on! Tighten up! Die! Midori's become a monster! What the... Midori's a monster!? Midori's a monster! What about Midori? Midori's right there. Are you okay, Midori? You son of a... There's a bit of thread here. Fall in! Number! 1 2 3 4 You wash, you mend the tent you tidy up the dressing room, you cook and you... you both... are off duty. Midori, you don't have to do anything. Come, I'll give you a present. Damn, this is bullshit, bossy asshole! But he's stronger than us. Wait and see... I'll show him what I got one day. Easy money! You've got the calculation wrong. But the maintenance fee... This should be enough. Don't you rip everybody off. I'm paying them generously. I only receive a few... No, they won't come along with such a low wage. But I'll handle the money. Leave it to me. Leave everything to me. Midori Sorry to pick on you. It won't happen again. It's just because you and I lately haven't... you know. Let's be friends. You know I... love you, really. It's true. Midori's mine. I won't let him take her. Help! Here. Take my hand. Who are you? I'm you. Wonder Masamitsu! No, I am you. You! I will not be deceived by your tricks again! Really? Then try escaping that hole. You can't. So why not just simply take my hand? Oh, I see. You have no hands because it's lying there. My apologies. You... freak! What? What did you call me!? Help... help me! Midori's mine! How dare you compete with me. You are a worthless piece of crap. Midori... Die! There you go. Wow! A pay raise! Here you go. Me too! You, too. Awesome! Hey, where's Muchisute gone? He's eaten soil. Why did he eat such thing? In any case how did he eat without his hands? Wait, Midori! Why run from me? Midori... You saw it? You saw what I did. Let me go. I did it for you, Midori. That bugger is better off dead, right? Listen. Never tell anyone what you saw today, okay? Never say a word or I'll be cursed... Is he really a good person? Maybe he's horrible... Can't you sleep? Rest in peace... Thank you for this grave, Master. He must be happy, too. Wait! Aren't they foreigners? Well... Who's in charge here? Keep it down! Oh...! Police officer. It is against the law to hire unregistered foreigners. Are these two registered? Well, I was a bit busy so... Your show is cancelled. Oh no, please, officer! This will be reported to our superior so prepare yourself. You'll be arrested if a warrant is issued. Master! We only have you to help us out. Isn't there any way out, Master? There is a Dietman in town called Ryugasaki. He's influential. Then... I've heard rumors that he likes boys. No, not Kanabun! Please spare me that! Good news! We can perform! Really? How come? We're off the hook, thanks to our Master! Awesome! Midori. Look what I got. From who? Why should it matter? You want it too, right? No, I don't. Hey! Don't! Let's show our treasures to each other. Don't! Give it back! Everything's gone weird ever since you came! You guys killed Muchisute, right? You fuckin' murderer! Help! One stab leads to heaven. Say goodbye to hell in this world. This place... Midori... how sweet of you. No! Help! Are you all right? You're okay now. And Kanabun? Kanabun is just asleep. Excuse me. May I speak with Midori, please? Midori, there's someone here to see you. We are from this company. Oh! Kamata Shochiku! A film company. We would like to scout you for our new film. It's for a leading role in a film called "A Star of Mother & Child" I saw you on stage and made up my mind. I'm glad that I came all the way to meet you. A leading role! It's not fair, Midori! Good for you, Midori! I ask you to star in this film. You'll become famous for sure. If you do, you can eat delicious food everyday and everybody will treasure you. It'll be stupid to turn it down. What are you doing!? That's cruel. I'm Midori's guardian and I choose what's good for her so get out. Leave it, it could be fake. What do you mean, fake!? Get lost! Midori, it's time to go on stage. I've got a headache. Really? You're lying. You belong to me. All you have to do is just obey me! If you can't obey me, stay like that. I'll go alone. Hurry up, man! Time's ticking. Get in! Hey! We'll break the bottle and let you out if you get stuck! Shut up and be quiet! I can't concentrate. What's up with you? You, annoying group of imbeciles! You are curious and yet cowardly. You are greedy and yet lazy. Anything that happens to you is somebody else's fault. What are you on about? And yet you act as if the world belongs to you. You are all impudent fools! Bullshit! Looks who's talking! You're just a freak! Just a freak...? YOU! You have just said the word you should never have! Pay the consequences! Suffer! Thank you... I can stand now! I can see! My eyesight is back! He's creepy... He's like a freak. Distort! Twist! Oh no! Stop it! You all die! Out of the way! We found Wonder. I am sorry, it won't happen again. Please let him off the hook, just this once. Keep it under control. Will do, will do. He must be exhausted. It was incredible. That taught them a lesson! It sure has. Thanks for coming all the way. It's no delightful business. Look what he has done. Who cares! They got their own body back. It would've been better if they all stayed that way. Hey! What if the audience went wild after that? Well they didn't and went home quietly. They must have been scared to death. I want to see it again. We can no longer stay here. Got to move. I'm quitting. What? No, please wait, Master! Why so soon? I don't feel like doing it any longer. If you are mad at what I said earlier, I'll take it back. What will you do next? Master! Master! Master...! Midori what are you praying for? Sorry about what I did. I just don't want to let you go. Please come with me. No, I don't want to go anywhere anymore. I want to go home. One, two, three. Walk straight on. Further further inside. It's Tokyo! Midori, don't stay out playing till it's late. What's wrong with you? Just eat up. I want to clean up. Okay... Here. What is it? Snacks for your school trip tomorrow. Daddy got them for you. Thank you, daddy. Better go to bed early so you won't oversleep. Right! Thank you. Thank you... I saw my family at last. If you stay with me I can show you your family whenever you want. Mr. Wonder, I... I want to become an actress. I want to be treasured by everyone. All right. But will you stay with me? I will. Hey, what's up with you? We're starting soon. You really are thick, aren't you? Don't you know? Our boss took all the money and left with another guy. What!? Where are you going? I don't know but it's no use staying here. I'll find an old, rich guy and live on. What, at your age? Shut it and worry about yourself. I'll be fine. Another circus has recruited me. I'll ask whether you guys can come along, too. Oh, you guys. Are you leaving already? Huh? This money... These are for the foreigners. Should be enough to take you home. Where did you get this money? Never you mind. Thanks for everything. Midori, you look adorable. Where's this guy? He went out just now. He's a murderer who killed every single village people. We should be safe now... What...? My money... Can't be.. My money! My money's gone! Take care! Enjoy life! Midori! "KAMATA SHOCHIKU" All has been arranged presuming that Midori will star in the film. Her residence is arranged and ready, too. So let's go and meet the staff of the film. Mr. Wonder will act as Midori's manager for support from now on. I'm Midori Hanamura. Nice to meet you. Director... Lines please. I am no longer... lonely or alone. Midori, continue. Yes, I now have my supporter. There is nothing to fear. I will push my way up and seize everything in the world! Wonderful! I am so glad you got the part! She's great! Congratulations, Midori. I'm happy for you. Midori, share us your determination for this film. I will do my best. How's your condition amidst this shooting? I will do my best. Mr. Wonder, I'm so tired that I can't remember my lines. Thank you, Mr. Wonder. Midori, you're on! Wow, man! Midori looks different! Good for her. She would've been Miss Nobody if she stayed on. Boring. Where am I? What was it I saw all this time? Is this real or fantasy? Same difference. Reality is a fantasy and fantasy is reality. Everything is both side of the same coin. Extraordinary things happen at night. Arrows shoot past during the day. Darkness creeps during the night. Severe sickness befalls in the daylight. Yet, never not be afraid of anything. Cut! Cut! Cut! What's wrong, Midori? Are you tired? There's so much more... I thought that I'd be treasured. I just wanted to be taken care of! What is your wish? Wealth, reputation authority, honor or... Everything. Once you've gained something, you no longer want it. That's why I want to have everything. Everything in this world. Okay, that's a wrap! Thank you, Midori! Thank you! Thank you, Midori! You are a shining star! Mr. Wonder, being an actress is boring me. Then what is your next wish? I want your magical power. If I gave you my magical power I will be left with nothing. But I want to help you in return, so please give me your power. I don't have enough strength to give you my power though. Then that means it's pointless for me to stay with you. If I gave you my magical power will you stay with me? I want to rely on my own strength to live on. Then, I shall give you my magical power, Midori. Mr. Wonder? What's wrong? Stop it! Everything's disappearing! Three, two, one.
