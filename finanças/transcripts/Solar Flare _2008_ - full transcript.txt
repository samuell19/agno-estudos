- The major donors are in the main car senator. You just about ready? - Just checking the facts. - Excellent sir, right this way. - Western one tracks are clear all the way to L.A. You should have smooth sailing. Copy that. - Gentlemen, gentlemen good to see ya. How are ya? How are ya? Don't get up, don't get up. - Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you to senator Simon Melchard. - Thank you Trent. I'd just like to say what a pleasure it is to be here today, riding these steel rails that formed the backbone of this great nation. Gentlemen I'm sure you're aware of the vastness of the American railroad system but did you know that there are no fewer that 550 separate railroad companies hauling a fleet of 1.5 million freight cars over a network of 142,000 miles? One freight train alone can carry the load of up to 500 trucks, the savings in fuel costs are astronomical. But unlike other continents the vast majority of railroad companies in America are profit making, tax paying and privately owned and I mean to keep it that way. Trains are good for the ecology and I'm not just saying that because you wanna hear it. - What the hell? Wester one this is dispatch five. I got ya dispatch five, what's the problem? You changed tracks a few minutes ago. That's not possible we're set on automatic. - Well you're on the wrong track. Hang on. There's something wrong with the controls here. I can't get anything to read properly. What track are we on? - You're headed for Union Station and you're going way too fast. - I'm gonna shut her down. How long do I have. - Union Station's coming right up. At your speed you better hit the brakes right now. - Trains transport seven out of every 10 cars sold in this country and as your senator I feel that we need, we must protect the interests of our valued train industry. Senator, gentlemen please take your seats immediately, repeat please take your seats immediately. Gentlemen we're gonna have to delay this meeting, we'll pick it up when we come to a complete stop. Well what kind of an emergency did they say it was? - They wouldn't give me details but it doesn't sound good. - What's going on? - The communication system's gone haywire. The track switched on it's own and they can't slow down fast enough. - In a nut shell? - They're gonna ram Union Station. - Jesus Christ. It is another scorcher here in Los Angeles. Air quality index is reported as unhealthy so it's best to stay inside today, maybe crank up those air conditioners. In the news authorities are still investigating the train accident that took the lives of senator Jed Melcher and eight others when it crashed into Union Station yesterday morning. Some theorize that it may have been due to unusually strong solar wind shock waves that might have caused a peak in the power grid but we'll have more on that later, first, let's hear some more music. Something wrong? - The music. - Well change it to something you like. You writing a love letter? The grocery list, well you can cross out x y and z variables I got some last night. I swear to God you were left on my doorstep by gypsy's. - Mom, I'm trying to work. - Well try to interact with your mom. - Fine. What would you like to talk about? - Well there's a midnight movie in the campus theater tonight sounds like a lot of fun. - And you wanna go? - No Riley I wanna take you. - I have to study. - Well you can take a break for one night. - My classes require applied studying. And even if I could take a break, I don't see the point in watching movies. God the point is to have fun. - School work is fun. Yeah that's why people bring algebra exams to parties. - Mom I'm only 15 years old. Geez here we go. - I am the youngest person ever accepted into the Empire science program. - I know... - And I have to try twice as hard to prove myself. - Sweetie you're a genius, we have the test scores to prove it you could teach most of the classes you're taking. - Mom, please, it's college, not high school. And I won't be a kid genius for much longer we can't rely on that. - That's not what I meant. - College is what pays for the rest of my life. - Riley you misunderstand... - My scholarships and acceptance into Empire is my only hope for bettering my situation. - Your situation? Ouch. - What? - Nothing, you're right. You can do better in life than I could, I'm grateful for that you know? I may not have gone to college but I do have experience as a mom and whether or not you excel well in school I have to make sure you're happy. You're more than just a brain Riley. - I want you to have a great day and think about what I said. Jeez, what's wrong, am I in trouble? - No. I am. - What's this? - It's a permission slip for me to have a private physical education tutor. - They're forcing you to take gym? - Yeah, cause I'm a minor it's the law. It's a ridiculous law. Can I get out of it. - I don't want you to get out of it this is exactly what I'm talking about. You need to get outside, take a break from the books, get some fresh air. - You know I'm not an invalid. - Then stop acting like one grandpa. - Ha ha. - What am I gonna do with you? I want you to reconsider going to the movies tonight. - Grow up. - Excuse me? - Sorry, you know I'm sorry mom but I'm not like you. You know there are certain things I wanna accomplish with my life. Maybe if you had focused a little more on school and less on. - What, having you? Cause I never got to be a teenager you know, I was to busy giving birth, changing diapers, looking for work. - I know. - And I'm sorry if my waiting you to enjoy life is annoying you. - I said I'm sorry. - It's not like I'm asking you to get featured on the latest addition of kid geniuses gone wild. I just what you to enjoy all that life has to offer. - Mom. - What? - You're a fit loving parent and a healthy role model, I appreciate everything you've done for me. - Why can't we have a normal fight. Move it lady. - Andy, how you doing? Good to see you to, okay. Hey Gordon. - Hey darling. - Can I get a cup of coffee? - Of course. - Hey beautiful you look lonely. - No I look annoyed. Get your hand off me. - What are you a lesbian or something? - Listen buddy the entertainments that way. - The entertainments right here. Why do you wanna be such a tease, why don't you get on stage and do your little dance for me? - I'm not a dancer. I'm a bouncer. Gordon could you sit milk in that for me I'm gonna take out the trash. - Sure darling no problem. - Non fat. - Yes ma'am. - Lady I thought you were a stripper. - Yeah well those dancers aren't animals and this isn't a petting zoo. So you wait here I'll call you a cab since you've been drinking. Say thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you. - Very nice. - With no survivors authorities are still searching for clues as to what caused the sever malfunctioning of the trains and weather or not it can be linked to the solar flares that erupted minutes before the tragedy. Hey boss. You're not about to give me a raise are ya? - Our planets atmosphere has always been enough to protect us from the radiation of solar flares and the disruption of electronics, while it's been inconvenient and costly it is rarely been life threatening. However what we're seeing now is that as our environment is being compromised by pollution, so to is our atmospheres ability to protect us. My research lab is studying these flares hoping to discover a better way to predict them. Given enough warning the dangers of even the greatest solar flares could be averted but unfortunately no technology as of yet can accurately predict a solar flare beyond a few hours. They can only tell us when one has already occurred. Questions? - Yeah if we were subjected to a solar flare magnitude of X206 what would the damage be? - Well you could certainly cancel any plans you have to fly to the moon. Satellite would corrode, most certainly cease to function which would mean out militaries surveillance systems would be compromised, airplanes or any air craft would malfunction, pipe lines used to distribute oil and gas would malfunction cutting off global fuels supplies indefinitely. There would also be massive power surges, blackouts, in short global chaos. - But this could be avoided if people had time to prepare like shut things down properly before the flare hit. - Well yes, I mean most of these catastrophes could be avoided with adequate warning time but unfortunately as I said we can't adequately predict these flares. But my hope is maybe someday. - But not by tomorrow? - No, no, we are years away from that kinda technology. Thank you for your time everyone we're done. - Doctor Clark. - Mhm. - Thanks for the lecture. - You're welcome. - I read your book last week. - The entire book in a week? - No, one day a week ago. Hu. - It was pretty good. - Well thank you? - I took a look at the statistical relationship between sigmoid's and solar flares as far back as I could obtain data and observe magnetic fields around sun spots, the rest is in my report. - These calculations are all in long hand? - Well yeah, like you said there's no technology to do this sort of work, so I just had to do it myself. - This is, what is your name? - Riley Cassana. - Riley this is really advanced work, can I take it and study it? - Yeah I made it for you anyhow. - Who taught you how to do this? - I've always seen things, like I can see patterns in nature, in the stock market. - And sun activity. - Yeah, mathematics just gives me a language to express what I see. - Then is this why you were asking about gigantic solar flares? - Well my calculations lead me to conclude that something is going to happen. - A solar flare? Of gigantic proportions like you mentioned? - There's no way to be certain. - Right. - Maybe bigger. I gotta go, I gotta go play games or something but here is my phone number, email, and address if you wanna talk about my report. Thanks again but I'm probably wrong about this but thanks. And sorry about the purple spots of page eight, I was eating a juice pop. - Still no taxi. - Yeah well I didn't get a chance to call one, I was busy getting fired. - Because of me? Lady I'm sorry, really I'm so, so sorry. - Yeah sorry, I got it thanks. Where do you live? - Hancock park. It's a nice neighbor hood. I'll give ya a ride. - Really? - I got a lot of free time but you're paying for gas and if you touch me I'll cut you. - Okay. - Fired, again, hey at least I'm consistent. - Riley. - Coach wells? - Call me Corey, you ready to have some fun? - If I follow through with the physical effort necessary to constitute adequate involvement but don't have any fun will my grade be the same? - Wow they weren't kidding about you. Come on let's go, come on. Give me ten more. That is really sad. You know what, keep going till I tell you to stop. So that even with this additional wing we are literally bursting at the seams. - I never knew donating money would require so much walking. - Doctor Clark I thought you'd be long gone by now. - I was just heading out I got caught up in a students report. - Actually I'm glad you're here, Mr. Pryor I'd like to introduce you to doctor Joanna Clark who has generously gifted us with a guest lecture today. Doctor Clark runs the viscer Clark research lab. - Isar Clark founded by Jerome Clark and David Viscer in the 60s to investigate modern mans impact on the environment. - Yes. - So you must be Jerome Clark's very beautiful daughter, it's a pleasure to meet you, I'm Marshall Pryor. - Of Pryor industries? - That would be me. - Mr. Pryors on a good will mission, his company is looking to contribute to society by funding organizations that are out to improve our world. - You sound like you've memorized our press packet. I'm really no more than an errand boy for my father. An errand boy for one of the largest privately held companies in the world. - Well that depends on which month you're talking about. - No wonder you were so familiar with my lab, you helped have it's funding cut just after we published our report on how you're oil and gas pipe lines impact natural habitats. - More specifically we funded an independent scientific investigation that... - That not only negated the research of reputable scientists but made it seem like our efforts to protect the environment were somehow unamerican. - I agree, it was an absolute travesty which is why most of the people that handled that report are no longer working for my company. - Dr. Clark I'm not sure this is the time or place... - No Dr. Clark has every right to be angry. I can stand here and blame a lot of people but you're right the ultimate responsibility lies with my family. You and I inherited our father's work, when somebody threatens that, we take it personally. - That's very magnanimous of you Marshall. Mr. Pryor's company is making an extremely generous donation to Empire. - I just wish it could be a lot more. - Me too. - Dr. Clark! - I'm sorry Roger I have to go. - Please accept my apology Marshall Dr. Clark is a guest lecturer she's not on our staff so obviously her opinion is not that of the... - Let me explain something to you. I donate money here because I believe in what you do. Don't ever patronize me again. - Of course, I'm sorry. - Actually doctor Clark has alerted me to a wrong that I must try to right. - Don't think about it, just watch the ball and go for it. - I don't understand. - It's not something you work out in your head Riley. It's something your body responds to with practice. Talk to me. - This is embarrassing, I'm 15 years old and you're playing catch with me like I'm a kid. - I'm 30 and I still play catch with my dad. And I'm gonna keep playing with him until his hip goes out. Or mine does. - But I can't even do it, it's embarrassing. - Everyone has to suck at something. It's like natural law, I suck at math. - Everyone else can dribble and catch, I'm just a freak. - No way, you've got a brilliant mind. Everyone is in awe of you. - They call me the robot. - Yeah? They call me coach smells. I'll tell you what, forget that the goal is to catch the ball, just try touching it as soon as possible, alright? And you're getting exercise so even if you miss it you're still succeeding. - Whatever. - You ready? Now remember just try touching it. There you go. - You missed it, I threw right at you and you missed it. Yeah! - Hey Clark. - Hey Kline. - I've got some really great news. - That's good, congratulations. - So you're not listening to me at all are you? - Sorry, I'm sorry. - So what happens when that hits zero? - I hope nothing, so what's you're good news? - Well, I've just secured us our funding. - What? The whole budget? - Over budget. - That is amazing, from what sources? - Just one. - Just one organization? - Yup. - Well who? - Just when we were gonna have to close this place down. - Who's funding us. - I swear, I don't think we would have lasted another month. - Kline, who funded us? - Pryor industries. Now we're lucky, we're very, very lucky. Marshall Pryor called me himself, he called me. - I don't believe this, I just met him today, it can't be some. - Come on, come on finish your sentences so I know what you're talking about. - I just met Marshall Pryor today after the lecture at Empire, I mean he's getting the royal treatment for throwing around a few cheques at dean Hawthorn. - Well yeah, santa has come to town, this is our Christmas bonus. - We can't take the money Kline. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no, yeah, yes we can. Yes, yes we can and we must, because we really are on the verge of shutting down. We'll be doing our research from card board boxes in the street. - Pryor industry companies are notorious for environmental pollutions. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - John Pryor actively lobby's against pro environment legislation. - Who's John Pryor? - The CEO, the big daddy, Marshall, the one who swept you off your feet, he's just one of his many sons. They run their company like some sort of cross between Al-Qaeda and a Partridge family. - But we can use their wealth for our good cause, think of it as recycling. - Has it ever occurred to you how quickly we're gonna become dependent upon their funding I mean what if they decide to pull the plug because we publish a report that they don't like? - Well I'll tell you if we sit around waiting for funding from a source that's completely guilt free it's not gonna happen. I mean like it or not nobody ever got rich from making sure no one got hurt. - Listen to yourself, now it's about getting rich? - No, no, no, it's about making this laboratory the best, I mean come on don't you want to upgrade this equipment, don't you, and would it be so bad to have an espresso machine in the break room? - Alright. - So what's about to hopefully not happen? - A solar flare class B8. - Well how did you find. - Shh, here it comes. Boy. - It happened? - A solar flare class B9, a nearly perfect prediction. - Alright, alright, just start explaining. - I met this student today who gave me this report in which he predicts a series of solar flares in CMEs, in his predictions he gives magnitudes and time, some of which have already occurred. - And you think this is valid. - Well you just saw it in action for yourself. - Well then why did you hope it wouldn't happen, I mean this is great, if we found someone that could predict flares then maybe he could help us do it ourselves. - True. So? - So this student Riley is predicting a solar flare class X206. - No, no, no. Wow a 206, that's impossible. - No, not impossible just terrifying. - Well when did he say this was gonna happen? - In less than 18 hours, which is why I've got to call the NSF, now. - Everything's gonna be okay, I'll get another job again, everything will be okay. Help. - Alright, dad everything's fine. No, I know how to run a company. Right, no sir I'm just trying to make you. No disrespect at all sir I'm just, no, no, I understand. My love to mom. I'll do anything to make that happen sir. - Wow this has been some kind of day. - Nice. - I really appreciate this, I've just never had an opportunity to go to this part of the campus before. - Well the athletic field is right over there. - This is my mom, mom this is my coach Corey. - Miss Cassana, nice to meet you, Corey Wells. - Mr. Wells I can't believe you actually taught my son how to run with a football. - I'm a bit of a genius to. so why are you here so early? - I'll explain it to you later. - Did you finally quit your job? - I'll explain it to you later as in not now. - Hey can Corey come to dinner with us tonight? Does he want to come to dinner with us? - Corey? - I actually would like to talk with you about Riley. - See? You guys can have serious talks about my development and then after we can shoot some basket balls. - Shoot hoops. - Whatever, yeah. - Except you don't have a basket ball. - We'll borrow one form the school. Or a hoop. Yeah. - I've never seen my son be so comfortable with someone other than myself. - Is that alright with you? - Alright, it's an answer to my prayers. - So what are we having? - How about celery and eggplant? No. - Mom? Okay, raw eggs and kidneys? - She does this every time. Not it. Wilted lettuce and mayonnaise. - Pizza? Pizza, well sounds weird but okay. - Pizza. I can do pizza You can do pizza? Yeah. - Let me get this straight, you're telling me the governor won't speak to me unless I have an appointment but I can't get an appointment unless the governor wants to speak to me? This is of the utmost urgency. Surely you have protocol for that? Email, no, you don't understand. Hello, hello? I don't believe this. - What? - She said I'm the third person to call in today saying the worlds about to end. - Other scientists? - No, one said that UFOs were gonna be invading and the other said that God was gonna rain down fire. - Well that's not far from the truth. - Alright, I've tried the NSF, my government contacts, the local news and nobody wants to listen to me unless I have other scientists corroborate my data. They don't even want to look at Riley's report. What did you find out? - Well in studying current solar activity the kids predictions are dead on, some pretty sizable flares have already happened, we should start seeing effects from geomagnetic storms in, a matter of minutes. - And in 17 hours the big one. - Eventually the Soho satellite will detect it right? - Ya but just before it happens, by then it'll be to late. We need government officials to alert people to take cover, they need to shut down the power plants and the pipelines, they need to alert the national guard. - I have a suggestion. - This kind of catastrophe could be avoided if only the bureaucrats would listen. - Call Marshall Pryor. - Why? - He's big money, his family owns half the pipe lines in the country, if anybody can get the governments attention, he can. Now here. I know you hate his politics but he might be the only chance we have. - When Riley was a baby he and his dad were in an accident. His dad didn't survive. - I'm sorry. - It hasn't been easy, I was barely an adult when I had him. I never got the education he's getting, and working full time I'm just not around as much as I'd like to be. - He's lucky to have you. - I wish he felt that way. - I'm sure he does. - He has this amazing gift. I sometimes wonder where he could be if I could have afforded private schools for him. His scholar ship got him into Empire. Anyway I really appreciate you stepping in. - I'm just doing my job. - You have any kids? - You mean besides the 300 I take care of daily? - Mom. - Yeah? - There's something I need to tell you. - Sounds serious. - Okay. - I was just waiting to make sure but now. Now I'm pretty sure. - Riley what's going on? - I can't believe I let you convince me to call this man. Shows you how desperate I am. - Just keep an open mind Clark you know you're to suspicious of people. - No not suspicious, just discerning. Fine you're just discerning, just remember our future is with this man. So no matter what your personal feelings are we need him. Good luck. Ma'am. - Thank you for your time. This is urgent business so I hope you don't mind if we get right to it. - Of course. - To reiterate what we talked about on the phone, we received data, very reliable data that a solar flare of tremendous proportions is due to occur in less than 17 hours. Precursors are already hitting the earth. We can expect that anything electrical will start to malfunction. - I took the liberty of doing some research after you called me, it seems that your lab is the only lab in the whole world that has this information, how's that possible? - Well that's because it didn't come from our lab. It comes from a college student. - A college student, really? - He has been virtually dead on in every one of his predictions down to time and magnitude. - Interesting. - What matters now is we need to get this information to the government. - You said this was gonna effect pipe lines? - Yes, any pipe line that isn't safety locked will be effected, worse case scenario they could ignite. - Forgive me for being a little to personal, but this afternoon you treated me like the enemy, why are you bringing me this information? - Well without other scientists corroborate this data nobody will take it seriously. And there simply isn't time for that. - Well what you're saying is pretty unprecedented. - Yes. - You can't blame people for being suspicious. - I'm not making this up. - I believe you. - Okay good. - Alert all of our people, every pipe line should have a safety lock. Yes sir. - I also need you to get this information to the heads of state, I mean ideally the president if you can. - I can do it. - Good. - I'd like to meet this student who managed to do what no computer or satellite could, he sounds like the kind of man I'd like on my team. - No, I'm afraid that's not possible. - Why. - He's a minor and I haven't even spoken to his parents, I mean the only reason I came to you was the urgency of. - Well don't you think his parents should make that decision? - I can't, in all good conscious. - You can't in all good conscious what? Introduce him to the evil, big power, Pryor Industries, is that what you can't in all good conscious do? I fund his school, I'm funding your lab. - I never agreed. - You need my contacts and government relations. You're treating me like a renewable resource. All I want is an introduction to the kid, maybe an address. - I'm sorry I can't. - Well if you can't, you can't, I think finding an underage college kid shouldn't be to difficult. - Please don't. - From this point on you answer to me. I'm sure that I can trust in your complete secrecy. - Secrecy? No the whole idea is that everybody knows, that's the whole point! - No that's your point Dr. Clark. Like I said, I'm sure that I can trust in your discretion. - You have no intention of going public. You're gonna protect your pipeline and your power plant, and you're gonna let the rest go to hell? So you can swoop in and have your monopoly on power? - Would that really be so bad? I mean if your lab is part of that monopoly? - I'm getting out. Let me out. - Ma'am. - I'm gonna tell you something doctor. I like you, and I appreciate where you stand. But you are a nearly broke single woman who has nothing to lose. I'm a business man who answers to millions of people. Now I am very sorry that we couldn't come to some sort of an agreement here. But this is bigger than me, it's bigger than you, it's bigger than all of our differences. So if you'll excuse me, I have child prodigy to find. - I am not gonna let you get away with this. - I want you to treat the doctor like she's our special guest. If she tries to escape or does anything stupid. Make sure that you don't ruin the upholstery. - Yes sir. - Detective Pager, it's Marshall Pryor. I'm very good sir, I have a favor to ask you. I'm looking to find a very special young man. He's a student at Empire. - Listen I know that Pryor's your boss but if I don't get help soon you and everyone you care about is going to die. - What the hell? What the hell's going on up there? I don't know, everything's going crazy! Come on, let's go. - I don't fight man, I just drive. - Stop, stop, stop, stop, please. Are you alright? - Yes, please, please. I've been shot. Can you take me to this address please, 107 RL way? of course no problem. Sorry about the blood. Are you sure you're okay? - We have breaking news about some mysterious power glitches that may be due to solar flares, first and foremost reports confirm that there is no immediate danger and that the flares, while more dramatic than normal, are likely to pass. People are encouraged. No. - Fire fighters and local authorities are optimistic tonight as things seem to be returning to normal. - Okay Riley what should we do, board up some windows? - I'll run to the store and get some water. - Good idea. What was that? I don't know but it's not safe outside. - Okay Riley you're right, we have lots of water here, let's just stay together, I'm gonna call grandma. I don't get it, why isn't the government doing anything? - They don't realize what's coming. - But things are happening now, why aren't they doing something now? - Because so far all it is it's just. - Mom. - Jamie are you okay? - Yeah I'm okay, I won't be helpless, I will not be helpless. - Mom. I know you're scared but everything's gonna be okay, alright? All we have to do is find a basement somewhere and just wait for a few days. - What about everyone else? - This is not the club, you cannot protect everyone. Mom. - Okay, I'm fine, I'm fine. We've been through worse right? - Technically no but I understand what you mean. - Mom. You're crushing me. - Sorry. Riley! - Who the hell is that? Doctor Clark? Thank God. - Okay. - Who are you? - My names Jamie. - Hey the phones ringing again, should I call an ambulance? - No, no. How long have I been out? - Not long. - Thank you. - You can thank Corey here, he's your doctor. - I was an eagle scout for three years. - Who did this to you anyway? - That's what I wanna talk to you about. My reports are right - I'm afraid so. - Riley's been giving us a crash course in solar flares. - He's in danger. - What? - We have to find a way to alert people. Riley I lost your report do you have another copy? - No but I have all the data memorized. - Good man. - Wait, what are you planning on doing? - Yeah, I'm lost what's going on? - Alright we just have to get out of here, we have to find a way to get Riley to somebody with authority. - Let's go. - Hold on a second, I'm not letting my kid out there, it's dangerous. - The most dangerous place for Riley right now is this house. I'll explain it to you later but we have to get out of here immediately. - mom, it's okay we can trust her. - Riley. - Please. Before it's to late. Who is it? - Officer Smith ma'am, LAPD. - It's the police Rambo. - Good evening ma'am, is everyone okay here? - So far so good, just a little rattled. No. How can I help you? Please don't be alarmed, the officers just here to make sure everyone's safe. - Great, my tax dollars at work. So really, what's going on? - He wants to take your son. - Has she threatened your son or you in any way? - No but she just got here. - Forgive me, I'm Marshall Pryor. - Jamie Cassana. - I apologize for the ominous entrance but these are extraordinary circumstances. - Okay. - Has she told you that Riley's report is gonna save the world? - Well. - Well no doubt she told you of the urgency of getting Riley an appointment with those in charge? - Yes. - That's why I'm here. - Don't listen to him, he only wants Riley's report for his own company. - No, no she's absolutely right. Riley's skills are an enormous value to me. I would pay just to have him help with this crisis. I want him on my staff. He'd be working for one of the most dynamic and successful companies in the entire world. - Well I guess it beats working in an ice cream parlor. - In addition I would like to offer Riley a scholar ship to any school you desire. Bottom line, I want him happy, healthy, and working for me. - You are wasting precious time. - I am ready to have them meet Simon Jensen right now. - Who? - From Picast? - What's Picast? - The presidents counsel of advisors on science and technology. - Wow, Simon Jensen, impressive. - That is absolutely right, he's in town and he owns me a favor. - He's in town right now, what an amazing coincidence. - It's no coincidence, I asked him to come. I'd really like for you to meet him. What was your plan doctor? Were you going to drag Riley through the streets of LA? Maybe smuggle him into city hall? - He is lying, he has no intention of going public. - Time is of the essence. I hope you don't think I'm being tacky. This is just to show you that my offer is legitimate. But we really do need to hurry. - Wow. You really want us to come with you. - I would do anything to make that happen. - Riley. - Yeah. - Go upstairs and pack your backpack with some over night stuff. - Really? - Yeah, just wait for me until I come get you understand? - I don't believe this. - I just wanna give him a chance to speak. - Thank you. You know officer I don't think we need you anymore but thank you very much for coming. - Why don't you make yourself comfortable, would you like a drink? Scotch? - I would love a scotch. - I'll help you. - Check up there. - Excuse me what are you doing? Look you cannot trust that man I know that I seem half crazed and he seems trust worthy but he almost had me killed this afternoon just for trying to go public with Riley's report. And I know that the money is tempting but I think that Riley should be protected and not exploited. - I don't know your first name. - Joanna. - Joanna listen carefully, you and I are gonna have a fight. - I'm just trying to help Riley. - Not with each other, with them. Now it's going to be you and me against those two men. I can do most of the work but I need you to protect yourself. See this kettle full of scalding hot water? That's for you, you're in charge of tea. - Got it. - Now that we understand each other I'm gonna finish making these drinks. - I'm scared. - Me to. Now let's kick some ass. - They're gone, they've escaped through the window. - What? - They grow up so quickly and before you know it they're gone. - You're gonna regret this. - Yeah, I know. Good timing There's a job opening for a bouncer down at the club I worked at if the scientist gig doesn't work out. - I'll consider it. - Call Sargent Bradly. I want every cop in the city looking for that kid. And get me to doctor Greens Feilder now. Yes sir. - Maybe we should split up and look for them, do you have any idea where they might be? - Yeah. Hide and seeks over guys. - Airplanes and other air craft are no longer being allowed to take off, however there are still hundreds of planes and other aircraft currently in flight. A hot line has been set up to deal with the flood of concerned calls. And authorities are requesting that you avoid calling. - Hello? - Kline, thank God. - Where are you, what happened? - Pryor is what happened. - What? - I am fine, Riley's fine, everyone is fine. - Riley's with you? - Yes. - The police are looking for him, it's all over the radio. - Damn it, we're not gonna be able to get him anywhere, if I only had his report. - Well I have his report. - What? - No I have it in my and right now. How? - Well Pryor gave it to me, he said you gave full approval. - No. - Yeah well he's got me prepping for a meeting with Simon Jensen of Picast. I don't. - Yeah, yeah, he's on his way to our lab right now. - Our lab, I don't understand why would Pryor give away that information? - He's not. - I don't get it. - Clark he's gonna sell it to him. - What? - He's selling the report, what's to stop him? - What's going on? - Pryor's going to sell Riley's report to Simon Jensen. - What if they don't meet his price? - We're stopping him? - How? I mean he's got he report, he's go the appointment, he's got everything. - No he doesn't have Riley. - What are you saying? - The four of us are going to stop Pryor, Jensen doesn't have to buy that information, Riley will give it to him. - Are you sure, I mean that is really dangerous. - It's our last chance to make a difference. We're going to that meeting. - Sweet. - Finish your cereal. - Kline. - What? - Shred the report. - What? - Shred it, we're coming with Riley. - Okay. - We're doing everything we can to provide relief efforts. Scientists around the globe are monitoring the suns activity, which they expect to die down before any major harm is done. Because of this the president has not declared a state of emergency. - Mr mayor what do you say to the accusation that we've got another Katrina on our hands? - Hurricanes can be predicted, what we're dealing with here is more mysterious. When you use the word mysterious do you mean as it pertains to the scientific community or to your particular office? - We are not sure exactly what is going on, we're waiting to get the latest reports from the scientific community. - Watch out for cops, Pryor's got them looking for Riley. They're gonna have to catch us first. everybody buckle up mommy's got a lead foot. - Kline said the back doors gonna be open. Pryor's gonna have the place guarded though. - How many men? - He didn't know. - Riley I want you to stay close to me or Corey but if we end up having to fight just run away until it's safe okay? - Mom I can take care of myself. - Okay but if we have to just remember what I taught you. - Punch for the balls, go for the eyes. - That's my boy. - Yeah, yeah. What was that? This isn't good. - Leading scientists blame these malfunctions on a geomagnetic storm that began recently, the effects of which should taper off in the matter of hours, police and government officials maintain there is no reason to panic and. My God, what the hell? Are we gonna be up any time soon? Not likely Carly. God damn solar flares. - Does this count as credit towards my PE requirement? - Now look who's cracking jokes? My God. - What the hell was that? - That's an airplane I think, probably the first of many. - We better go. - Alright come on. This is catastrophic. Just the beginning if we can't tell people what is coming. - Perimeter clear? No activity. - Are those Pryor's men? - Yes, they don't have any official power. - That's a good thing. - True. - But if they only take orders from Pryor, they might not have a problem killing us on sight. - Also true. - I like my outlook better. - Look Pryor might have a lot of pull in this country but he doesn't own everyone in Washington. - Pryor must be sweating bullets, he has a meeting with a presidential advisor and no report to show him. - I just hope doctor Kline is okay. - We should go. - Okay. - Freeze, we have a security breach on position number one. I think we have the kid. Piece of crap. Kid come here. - No, Riley no. - Give me the gun, handle first. Slowly. - Hey. Hey is that that kid? We just wanna see mister Jensen. - Don't move. Get off my mom. - You okay? - Yeah that was awesome, the stuff you taught me actually works. - Yup. - I added a punch to the jaw. - I saw that. What do we do with him? - I know. Bring him this way. Let's lock him in here. You think he's gonna wake up? I don't know, maybe? - You gotta teach me more of that. - Okay, let's save the word first, okay. - Alright, we gotta go. - Wait, this isn't usually here. Pice of pie. Kline must want us to go this way. - There, if you behave I'll make sure we don't forget to come back and set you free. - Who the hell are you? - Mcsweeny, I got the kid. - That's the kid? I wasn't informed. - You try using one of these things lately? Nothing but static. - Is it true you're smarter than a computer? - Computers aren't alive and therefore don't qualify as intelligent. - Shut up. Are we gonna stand around and chat all day or what? - Well Mcsweeny you've got your orders, you know what to do right? - Come on kid. - Hold it right there. Parker I need back up. Parker! - You're making a big mistake. - Nobody's perfect. - Run Riley. - Freeze. I'll give you five seconds to give my mom your gun, one, two. - That was amazing. - Thanks. - Sorry, you ok? - Yeah. - How you feel? - Like I got the coolest mom in the world. - Yeah, that's great. Corey? You alright? - Aside from being shot, I'm just great. But enough about me, let's get this thing over with so we can get to a hospital, get me some drugs - Kline, Kline. - Clark. I know, how did you, how did you make it this far? - I'll tell you when I have the time to remember, is the presidents man here? - He's in the meeting room. - Great, and you destroyed Riley's report? - Well yeah that's why I'm being kept prisoner here Pryor's upstairs trying to string Jensen along hoping that the police show up with Riley. Is that him? - That's him. - You know you are very gifted and I hope you'll consider coming to work with us. - We'll think about it. - Mom. Yeah, this is the same hand that. Well then let's get him upstairs and end this thing. - Wait I'm coming with you. - Of course. - You gonna be okay? Here. Yeah, it's happily ever after time. - Here we go, good luck everyone. Mr. Jensen thank you so much for meeting with us. Kline? - Sorry but he's our only hope. - What? - Shady. Shady. Yes sir. Sorry the communication has been. Tell the men they can go home, we're complete. Yes sir. And have Chang bring my car around. Yes sir. - It's a trap, Jensen was never here. - Excellent work doctor Kline, you have proven yourself to be quite the little mastermind. - I'm just doing my job. - Your job? - Clark, you're wrong to fight him, he can help us, I mean if you would just stop being so stubborn and idealistic and if you'd listen for once. - You're pointing a gun at me. - Sorry, I mean, just can you back, just back off. - I don't believe this, what has he done to you? - I'm trying to save the lab. - By threatening it's chairman? The lab your trying to save is mine. - Not if you don't survive. Well, I guess we find ourselves right back where we started. - You'll hurt my son over my dead body. - What you consistently fail to realize is that I have Riley's best interests at heart. His safety and his well being are vitally important to me. - Yeah so he can be your own private forecaster. - What is your problem? I'm gonna be paying this kid millions of dollars for what he does and since when does being a business man become synonymous with being a villain. - When you started pulling guns on people who disagreed with you. - I like you. - Okay cut the crap. What is it exactly you want from us? - I would like for you and Riley to come with me to my retreat so we can wait out this solar flare nonsense in safety and luxury. - Yeah? What's to stop me from reporting you once this is all over. - What are you gonna report? - That you coerced us into working with you, that you suppressed Riley's report. - What report? I'm just offering you a business proposal. Now I believe that we're starting to cut it close, we need to get to safety, agreed? - Agreed. - Riley. - Mom, he's got the upper hand and I want to see you safe. - Out of the mouths of babes. - Yeah but just for the record you're a very misled, narcissistic ass. - Look I can't leave Joanna alone with him. And what about Corey? - No, no, you go ahead, you do what you have to do. We'll be fine. We can take shelter in the basement. - So, let's go. - Let's go. - Kline. - What now? He's left you, if you shoot me no one's gonna connect him to it. - He needs me. - For what? - Well for. - Face it Kline, he needed you and he got what he wanted. I'm going to the basement. Come on. Come on let's go. - Get in. You know I really hope we can learn to be friends. I believe in what we can do as a team. - As a team? With that gun pointed at us? Where'd you learn your concept of team work, Afghanistan? Some day - Hey what's that sound? - Your chauffer. - Okay now you don't have to do that. We can come to some sort of an agreement. - Yeah how about this, you agree to do what I say and I agree not to donate your body to my sons science lab? Been waiting to use that line forever. Riley. - Yeah? - Go get doctor Clark. - Mom. - Yeah? - You're awesome. - So who's the most powerful person you can get us to in under an hour? - Maybe the mayor. - The mayor, that's the best you can do? - And he'll have a direct line to the governor who can contact the president. - He should. - Okay, well that's a start. - Doctor Clark, come on. - That's the problem when you're the boss and you double cross all your workers. You don't have any friends left. Your father must be really proud. I feel kind of nervous. - Don't be, you're amazing. - Do you like Italian food? - I love it. - Good to know. - Knock 'em dead guys. - Well how many people are on this right now? No we need all our teams working on this matter. I'll call you back. Hi, you must be Riley. - Hi. - I understand you have something for me? Great have a seat please. Now you're gonna have to walk me through this. I understand we don't have much time. - It's worse than that mister mayor, we need to go right to the top now. Mister mayor this is the white house please hold for the president. Is this Riley? - This is Riley. Well I understand you know more about this subject than our scientists we're mighty proud of you. - Thank you, thank you mister president. - Hope you get life. You're just as dishonest and crooked as your father. - Could you give me a minute? - Sure. - You know my father? - I read the papers. I know that you and your whole family got where you are by bribing, cheating, and taking advantage. - What do you make, like 30, 40, thousand? I spend that on scotch. Little people like you have no idea what it takes to make things work. - Well little people like me know that there's no scotch in prison. - Think you're smart? I'll be out of these cuffs faster than it takes me to write a cheque, money makes the world move little man. You can stand there and say Marshall Pryor is such a bad man, let me tell you something. Marshall Pryor makes things happen. - Your mother must be so proud. - I'm ready to go. - That's assault Pryor. - I didn't see anything, did you see anything? - No I didn't see anything. The environmental impact of the flares is an issue that will be debated for some time. Citizens are advised to seek shelter if you can, if nothing else do not leave your home. Power plants and pipelines are being shut down across the nation by presidential order. - Is this bar still serving? - Hey. - How's it going out there? - My boys a hero. - Mom please. - Shut up, I'm bragging about how great you are, a mom has rights. - Everything's on schedule, people all over the world are taking shelter. - Perfect time to go Christmas shopping. - It's like summer camp. - Yeah except the part about the exploding sun. - Hey, I smell cookies. - Morphine. - Okay I'm bored. I take it back, not bored anymore, now wishing I was bored. - We're fine, we're fine. - Promise. - Yeah, you know I just want you to be happy and enjoy all the fun that life has to offer you. - Okay Riley, no one likes a wise ass. - Ha ha. - Don't mess up my hair. - Hey, flashlight. - Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen it is a beautiful day here in Los Angeles the sun is shining and when we think about just a few weeks ago when we thought we were headed towards dooms day, felt like we would never see the sun shine again so let's sit back and enjoy some terrific music. - Alright throw it a little harder this. - Sorry mom still learning. - Hey, cookie? Moments like these are just to precious. - One bite of these will change that. - I think I forgot something. - Yeah like sugar. - And salt. - And butter, and eggs, and flour. - Okay. - Yeah. - Okay you have a choice between a new car and a karate chop so pick wisely. - Mom. I love you, you're my hero I hope you know that. - Thank you Riley. - I also hope. You never try and bake cookies again. - That's it. - Mom!
