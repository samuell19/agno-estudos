"When you only work in the night, you tend to forget you ever cast a shadow." Overheard on a street corner Closing Time What would you like? Minced meat, bamboo shoots, steamed eggs and cabbage. Hand me the white bowls! - The white bowls? Do you want rice or porridge? What's the soup of the day? - Radish soup. Here's your order, two bowls. Okay. Two bowls of rice and one bowl of soup, right? That makes 120. Hello, you want porridge? - Yes, please. What do you want as a side dish? With what? Hey, bring one porridge to the front table! That one... what's that? That's amaranth. - I want this one. Hey, make one porridge! - Got it. Here, thanks! Rice or porridge? - Porridge. Hold on, that's not yours! - It's not? Come, sit over here! Anything else? - Choy sum. Come here! Phew, heavy! Hey, over here! - But this one is full. Oh man, it's too heavy. Change this one in the back too! But it's too heavy! Go, go, go, get it changed! Congratulations my lady, tonight the Emperor has requested your presence. Among all the new ladies in this palace, the Emperor favors you the most. Thank you, Eunuch. Tsai Yue... Thank you, Eunuch! - What for? You must get ready to welcome the Emperor, my lady. But, I... Here, come, come... This is our governess. She will explain the etiquette to you. Later a sedan will come and take you to the Hall of Mental Cultivation. ...taking the medicine three times a day. But she still hasn't gotten better. Illness of the body is easy to heal. But mental illness needs mental medicine. Have you cooked the... - Yes, it's almost ready. It's 3 o'clock! Only open for three days and tired? - What, "three"? How many then? We've worked hard the last weeks, always opened for five or six days. Gonna run out of money if we take more days off. Hope it will cool off the coming days. The kitchen was hot as hell. With north wind coming from that side. - Yeah, it was so hot. That southern wind made the walls fucking hot. What are you going to do when you take off? Oh, you know, just rest. But business must be running good enough, to take some days off. Not really. But sometimes you need time for yourself. I also take only one day off per week. ... tropical depression is likely to strengthen into a typhoon as it continues to head northwest. It is expected to make landfall in Taiwan tomorrow morning. Due to circulating currents, rain and wind will increase across the north and mountain area during the night. Everyone should fully prepare for the typhoon. That pink fish has soft bones, right? Salmon is the best. Yes, salmon. - Salmon? Salmon is delicious and fatty. Well then I'll fry up two slices of salmon for you tomorrow. I don't want it fried! - He can't eat fat! It should be cooked in some butter though. He just shouldn't eat fat and you keep asking him. - Right. - I just can't. Bring him the thick soy sauce! - Or you could just... Buy it and put it in the freezer, right? Everyone knows it should be put in the freezer! Next time... I'll share a bit with you, if I dont' forget. What you mean by "a bit"? A bit will not be enough for me. Each of us will get a cut. You don't understand... - We have to split it! It's hard to cut, you know? - No! It's hard to cut if you want a piece that small. Because we're the small buyers, buying what's left, you know? "Big Taipei Market" speaking. Yes? 5529? Garlic? A bag or a dozen? By the guard? Like yesterday? So it's 5529? Got it, understood. Ok, got it. Thank you. Attention: A bag of baby corn was left at the temple. Not sure which seller it belongs to. A bag of baby corn was left at the temple. Not sure who forgot it there. If the baby corn is yours, please claim it at the temple. Attention: Someone delivered a bag of garlic to the wrong place yesterday. To the vendor number 5529. It's at the guard station now. Whomever sent it to the wrong place, please come and claim your garlic. The garlic was sent to the wrong place last night, thank you. Is mine ready? - Yours is ready. Everyone's taking forever, I'm so behind. Looks like business isn't going to open today. Okay... It's so cold outside and you're just wearing that? Well, I wear this everyday. No matter if it's hot or cold. I really wear this everyday. How come there is no local cabbage these days? Only the imported one? Basically all kinds of vegetables here are not local. Damn it, why? - Not even melons. Strange, what happened? Is it the weather? Two bags! Is it because the seasons are changing? That recent typhoon really destroyed us. Really? - That's what they say, I don't know. How could it be that strong? Ah it's all monopolized bullshit. - Fuck it! Right! 690, 890... 890 is the Smelt? Smelt is ... 600. - Okay. 890 plus 600... is 1490. 890? - Plus 600. 890... 900... 1500... 1490. If we split apart, when will we see each other again? The sorrowful life and the painful destiny is forcing us to part ways. Who can understand this kind of sadness and sorrow? I float upon the waves inside your heart. I am waiting night after night to reunite with you. Speak aloud, I don't want to separate with you. Speak aloud, I love my hometown and I love you. If we part, who knows when we will ever reunite again. Say it out loud, I don't want to leave. Speak aloud. I love my hometown and I love you. If we part, who knows when we will ever reunite again. Get the stuff from the back. Yeah, test it out first. Let's see if it works. You always take him on the bridge to pee, right? Yup. I caught you once. You never bring a bag to pick up his poop, do you? I do! Of course I pick it up every day. I follow the rules. - Otherwise I'll report you. No girlfriend to walk the dogs for you? He even carries water to wash away the pee. - Really? So clean? That's like in Germany. They do that in Germany. All he needs is a broom. And he may even clean the whole street. So thoughtful. Come see if it's straight. A-Jiao! A-Jiao! A-Jiao, come see if it's straight! The position? - Higher or lower? Okay, down a little. - Like this? Left side up a little. Move to the left a little. How's this? Right side up a little. - How's this? Right side up a little. - How's this? Yes. - Okay. See for yourself if it's okay. Want me to turn off the fan? - No need. It's the thought that counts. What? - Around 7:30. A-Je can get to work. - Yeah, I've told both of our sons. If we leave around 7:30, and stay 30 to 40 minutes, then A-Je can go to work directly. I've told them to go to bed earlier. We should get there before ten. Easy. We grab food first, and if we can't make it, he can handle it by himself. A-Hung can certainly make it. His class is at 1pm. 1pm, but the problem is that he's been so lazy lately. He's just taking a break, what's wrong with that? You should remind him. It's your turn! Soybean skin... Or fish? Alright, soybean skin. - Good choice. Tofu, soybean skin. Alright, the fish too. Were you gambling? - What a night, what a night! Yes, gambled till now. - Till now? From 9pm till now. - 9pm? Didn't drive any customers? You only drove a bit? - Just a bit in the evening. Just showed up a bit. - Just showing up you call working? It's my age. I don't have the energy to work like I used to. What age? You're not even a grandpa, why so nervous? Back when I started as a taxi driver, around 1980, I worked 18-hour shifts. That's too long! 18 hours... and when I got home and out of the car, it was like an earthquake. You've been driving for so many years? - That was really scary. At least work a bit so you won't get reported. What? Don't be like a homeless doing nothing. Why would they report me? I'm working, not doing anything illegal. He's too dramatic. - Yeah. Pon-Ji come. Come! Pon-Ji let's go! Pon-Ji, come here! Pon-Ji, come! Pon-Ji! Come, Pon-Ji! Come! Pon-Ji, come. Come here! Pon-Ji, come! Da-d... When we get home, help me putting the battery. What battery? We need to change the computer's battery. You mean the ABC thing? - Yes. The ABC thing. You have to help me. Can you help me when we get home? Why? The ABC... - The language learning machine. I want to do the ABC. Yuan-Ji-Dance: Spring Blessings A combination of martial arts, exercise and Yuan-Ji-Music. Together, become both dynamic and calm, fast and slow, hard and soft, delightful and steady. With Yuan-Ji create harmony, clarity and a natural state. The sky is clear, the earth is safe and the spring light shows. Fortune and wealth doubles up all over the world. Spring Breeze. We still have some left. - For frying the bitter melon? Yeah, or what else should we use? We always use that. It's fine. I checked today. The top is still fresh, not rough. Well, I buy them every day... - 30 dollars a pound. Not so cheap, is it? Come on, the asparagus leaves were only 25 dollars. Yeah, after it's cooked... -About 25 or 30 dollars. Was the package 20 or 25 pounds? - 20 pounds. 20 is enough. Asparagus leaves look bigger after cooking. Not sure if it lasts for one or two days. Would it be enough for two? - No. Not even for two days? Yeah, I'm home. Hey, why does that dog look so sad? He's not paying attention to his food, only looking for his owner. So he's always wandering... - Takes a look here, there. Looking for that familiar look. - Yeah. To see if his owner returns. - Right. Now he gave up. No wonder the dog looked so depressed the other day. They're remodeling the shop, so he lost his hope and sleeps at my place. He used to go to 7-ELEVEN, to get cool air. Now 7-ELEVEN is gone too. Around 4 o'clock, he checks at the door if his owner is there. If not, he walks away. Later he checks again. Still no sign of the owner. So he walks away and comes to sleep in my shop. He realized the owner... isn't there. - He lost his hope. And how come the owner closed the shop so suddenly? He had his reasons. - Like what? First, he reached a certain age. Second, he was working all by himself. If you work alone, it's easy to lose the passion and the spirit. Right. - He was by himself, no helpers. No one is strong enough to make it without helpers. But he didn't ask anyone for help. I saw him sometimes... - He was doing everything by himself. Sometimes I ran into him at the market. He was hard-working. Very hard-working. The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak. People at a certain age... - Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak. All the "back-in-the-day" talk doesn't work anymore. He never took a day off. He never did. - He never wanted to rest. Exactly, he never got enough rest... So he... with that load of... All year round. - ...he overworked. Yeah, I never saw him taking a break through the year. We have to refill the toys. Oh, and about those two machines, I might let Chen-Ke have them. Chen Shen-Ke? He wants to do it? For real? - Yeah. That's like hanging out a sheep's head to sell dog meat. What? No, I just let him do it. He mentioned it to me before. Shih-Wei just quit. Why not let him try? - About a month... Anyway, just let him make some extra money. Those two make profit. You just let him make the money? - No big deal. So nice of you. - What? So nice of you. - What then? How much are you charging, for rent? The same as the others. I'm not trying to profit from him. Oh. - Right? What? Why? You want them? You didn't want them before. 50 for the scallions, okay? 40? Going blind from looking at this. All so skimpy, what's going on? Damn, nothing left. I have to cut off plenty. Typhoon ruined it, what can I do? But man, after it's chopped, there will only be half left. Come on, it doesn't matter. At least we still got scallion. I need it just for the flavour, even if it's expensive. Damn it. Hey young man over there, that's the last I have! How's 1800? Alright? Good stuff! How about it? I give you a couple of thousand everyday, and give the fish guy 2 to 3 thousand. You two are sweeping me clean. Faster! So quick taking my money, but so slow in giving the change! Taking money should always be quick. But giving change is no big deal. Not enough? I'm getting upset. - Get me the coin box! Wait a second. It's red. ...love always falls deep into the ocean of affection. Only true love knows, that the deepest love has to wait. Like the moon, waiting for the clouds to fade away. Your singing is good! So hard to turn away from the love of my life, I'm hiding all the bitterness inside my heart. If this love won't end, who can help me to get over you? So hard to turn away from the love of my life. The road of this love is painfully long. Since then I'm bound to be lost and trapped in this entanglement. There's a part missing in my life, who can be my shelter and let me stay? If it's a sin to be so crazy in love, I'd rather take the responsibility alone. Thank you. How come today is like this? You know what? If you haven't touched the dish, just reheat it tomorrow. That's just how it is when you have no customers. If it's too rough, don't buy it next time. It should be softer now. Some people don't eat it. It's like water spinach, the bigger one. If it's expensive and old like these, don't buy it. I told you: Two if they're big, three if they're small. Come on, they're all big, please... How big exactly do you want them? What's the matter with you? What's the matter with you? - Nothing. Answer me, answer me. Ok, got it, got it. When will it get cheaper? You're killing me. Can't afford anything. - Probably about... Maybe a few more months. - That long? Fuck! Mustard greens are already cheaper. Mustard greens? - Mustard greens are already cheaper. How can I survive like this? Unbelievable! Alright, I have to go. Hello, do you have any cigarettes here? Yes we do. What brands do you have? Seven Stars or... Let me ask. It's okay. May I ask something? Where is this place? Lushan Reservation - Lushan Reservation? Is there a pay phone nearby? - Nope. No pay phones? - Nope. ...remain in my heart. Never turning back, no matter how long the road is. The darkness tests me. The fire burns me. Still I take them all. Never turning back. Never turning back. No matter how high the sky is. Sadness and loneliness, affection and happiness remain in my heart. Oh, goodbye! Oh, marching forward! Stations passing by me, one by one. Passing scenes of a landscape, just like in a movie. Acting like I'm the male leading role. Traveling around all the places, like Peter Pan. Doesn't matter if I'm naive or optimistic, I'll take on the responsibility, no matter what.
