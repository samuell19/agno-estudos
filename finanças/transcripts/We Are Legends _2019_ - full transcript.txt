[movie intro music playing] [lively music playing] [man] Watch where you are going! [man] Hey! [Bunny] Hey! Whoa! [man] You little punk! [friend] My God, where have you been? [Bunny] I ran here straight from work. Come on. [panting] Hey. We won the last two fights, good work! But this fight... You have to lose. If you lose, Blackie will erase our debts. And five-fold just for you. -Remember, make it look good. -Okay, all right. Wraps! Are you ready? [exhilarating music playing] -The Energizer Bunny! -[screaming] [man] Bunny! [swooshing] [crowd yells] [crowd moaning] [girls screaming] [grunts] [Bunny grunts] [grunting] [grunts] [crowd cheering] [gasps] Oh! [music intensifies] [crowd cheering] MADDOG: 4.5 FOLD THE ENERGIZER BUNNY: 1.5 FOLD [crowd screams] -[crowd cheers] -[grunting and groaning] [Maddog grunting] [crowd cheering] [crowd cheering] [exhilarating music playing] [man] Blackie, where's my money? [man] Let's talk to this guy. [Bunny making silly sounds] -[inaudible speech] -[crowd cheering] -Let's get it over with. -Who will handle what just happened? [cellphone ringing] -What? -[friend] Blackie is looking for you. -Bunny, find a place to hide out. -You want to fight right now? [gentle music playing] -[Jason grunts] -[Jack speaks] -[woman] Go, Jack! -[man] Hang in there! [woman] Jason! Hang in there! [Jason grunts] -[Jason grunts] -[woman screaming] -[Jason grunting] -[crowd cheering] [Lily shrieks] You got him, Bro! [crowd cheering] [birds chirping] [reporter] Your fight with Jason Chan went viral! Over three million views on YouTube alone. Jack. did you break his arm on purpose? Will you apologize to Jason? Apologize? It would be like apologizing to a punching bag. MMA is not a sport. It is survival of the fittest! When two fighters enter the cage, only one gets to come out the victor. If I had won by points, he can blame the judges' decision. If I had knocked him out, he can call it a lucky punch. But I broke his arm in two. He only has himself to blame. [reporter] With 49 straight wins on your record, you are a legend among amateur fighters. What's it like to be famous? Truth be told, I am not a talented fighter. We don't have champion coaches, or special machines to train with in the gym. -[inaudible speech] -[Jack] Everything I have today, I earned by hard work and dedication. We heard that you have quite an interesting upbringing. Care to share that with our viewers? My little brother and I actually grew up in an orphanage. -[gentle music playing] -Hey, brush those leaves down the steps. [Jack] Take it seriously! Or you don't get dinner tonight. [Eric] And you. -What now? -[Eric] That pile is yours. Hurry up, time to clock out! Sun is about to set! [grunting] Good work! Here, come on! One, two, three. [grunts] [happy grunting] Good! Here, watch. One, two, three. [Eric happy grunt] Just like that. One, two, three. [grunts] Straight punch goes right through. [Bunny grunts] [boy] Who let you play ball on my court? Give me back my ball, you tub of lard! Hit him, Bro! Let go of my brother! -[kids laughing] -[Jack grunting] [crying] Bro! Get him! -Hit him! -[Eric] Hey! No fighting on school grounds! No fighting! Hey! [Eric shouts] Headmaster! The janitor hit me! What did you say? -You little rat! -[kid groans] Headmaster. He's flopping like Zidane. You are hitting students now? I am so firing you this time! It's not Eric's fault! You can kick me out instead! Jack! You can't talk to the Headmaster like this. Where are your manners? Headmaster! I have had enough! I hate this damn job! I quit! No more! I go! I will take care of them both! Good Day! [Eric] You two, come on! Hurry up! Wrong way, this way. Come on! [bright music playing] [Eric] Watch your step. Dad, I found a spot! [man] Hey! -Get outta here, kid! -[dog barking] -Dad... -Sorry, excuse us. -What now? -Quiet. [Jack] Dad, what do we do? How do I know? What can I do? We just gonna sleep here? Toughen up, Jack, it's just one night. [thunder rumbling] [Eric] Big sister! [Simo] Bad karma... [grunts] Kneel down in front of Simo! [in unison] Simo! Anymore this time? We will sleep in my old room! You won't even know we are here. Come on, upstairs boys! -[lively music playing] -This way. Hurry. Come on, Bunny! Grab the bag. Go! Grab the bag! Left glove clockwise. Right glove anti-clockwise. [Eric] Left glove clockwise. Right glove anti-clockwise. [grunts] [inaudible speech] -Here, have some more. -Thanks, Dad! Tomatoes too. What are you doing? This is not how you punch. Let me show you how it's done! [Jack makes whooshing sounds] [whooshing sounds] [Eric] Last delivery to Chubby Ling, we go yum cha! [in unison] Yeah! Hurry up! -[Jack] Hurry up! -Oh! [somber music playing] -Dad! -Dad! Dad! Dad. Call an ambulance! Dad! Hurry! [panting] Help! [bright music playing] [Jack] Since dad had a stroke, as brothers, we began to grow. I found out that he was taking underground fights. [crowd cheering] Stop it right there! What now? Me and you! If you win, you do what you want! If you lose, no more underground fights! Why am I trying to earn money? I pay your tuition and you keep skipping school. Now you are expelled! Why am I going to school? It's also for money, right? Do you remember why we learned to fight? It's not about money. We fight for the belt, to be the Champ! You are the one who wants to fight professionally, not me! I can't do that. It's not me! Go fight for your belts. Dream on, but I've got bills to pay! Look at yourself! You grind yourself all day long for pocket change. You turn around and you don't get to come back! I won't! [bright music playing] [gasps] Simo... -The prodigal son returns... -Yes. Amateur fighters are just afraid of me. Forget those losers. My next fight will be my professional debut. If you get to see your brother again? What would you do? He's still my little brother. What can I do? Beat him up? That's all the time we have. Thank you, Jack, for being on our show. Hope you find a worthy opponent soon. Good luck on your professional debut! [both in English] Thank you! Let me take the pretty reporter to her car. [Simo] Thank you for coming to our gym! [chuckles] You little shit! -[loud punch] -[exhilarating music playing] [engine roaring] What's everyone looking at? You bunch of weirdos. Same thing every time. Aren't you bored? [clicks tongue] I have good news guys! [in unison] Lily, you are getting married? Jack found an opponent! He just signed the contract! -[man] Yeah! -Congratulations Jack! -[crowd cheering] -[woman] Congratulations Jack! -Hold up! -[gentle music playing] Who is the lucky bastard this time? Jason Chan? Again? I kicked his butt within a minute. Not him. How boring. Don't gloat! After you broke his arm, he signed with a new gym and a new coach. He has just won his last five fights. The fighters from his gym are all tested veterans. Every single one. But you have me as your coach, I am not bad myself. It's not a sure win for you yet. Wow! Bunny is back! -Big sister. -[Lily] You little shit! -[Jack] Don't encourage him! -[Simo] Hey! Worry about your own fight. Jason trains with world champions, nutritionists taking care of his diet. Protein powder sponsor. You have to lose ten kg in 14 days. You won't make weight even if I cut your legs off. We won't do that. You have done this before. You will make weight, just like last time. Not now. -Bunny! -What? -Come see your dad! -[stutters] [bright music playing] Kneel down! [grunts] [chuckles] Dad! Sleep well? How bad did you beat the white guy? -Not that bad, I pulled some punches. -[Eric] Ah. Stand up! Let me look at you. -[shouts] -[groans] How many times have I told you, protect yourself at all times! -How much do you weight now? -Hundred and thirty-eight. -Kilogram? -Pounds. Hundred and thirty-eight pounds. My old man always used to say, the best fighters of the world are 150 pounds. -Perfect balance of speed and power. -Hm. Where was I? Speed and power. -Yes! Hundred and fifty pounds! -[Bunny] Yes. Now your little brother is back. What a reunion! Train hard! Build up that body! Hundred and fifty pounds! -Say it with me! -Hundred and fifty pounds! Correct! [grunts] Win me some golden belts! [sighs] Why do you need all these belts? You don't have belts to use? [Eric] What's this? Looks like chicken intestines. L, E, G... [Lily's sister] Your team leader told me. You can't go on like this. I saw your boyfriend's interview on TV. Not bad, handsome kid. Can you really make a living doing MMA? [gentle music playing] Do people in Hong Kong even know what it is? Why don't you just find a nice guy and get married? Not everyone wants to marry rich and give up. I like the struggle. Don't you have dreams? Nope, I don't dream. That's why I don't have to work two jobs like you. and have to rush back to that smelly gym every night, Teaching Jujitsu without getting paid. Hey, Sis. could you ask my brother in law for a week holiday? Of course! You and I haven't been to Tokyo shopping in years! Your brother in law doesn't want me at the office anyways. Jack is in camp for a fight. He needs me by his side to cut weight. He really needs me. If you want to waste your youth on a furniture mover, go right ahead. I will just tell him you quit. [man shouts] [grunts] Okay, let's recap what we learned today. What do we do when an attacker approaches? One, maintain your distance with the attacker. -And? -Two, survey the area for an escape route! Correct! Good, class dismiss! [whoosh sound] Big sister, can I join your class? [Bunny] Oh! That stinks! Sis! Simo, this is Jason's last fight. -[Jack makes whooshing sounds] -[Simo gasps] He is very impressive. Jack! Shirt off, on the scales, quick! [man] What are you looking? [man] What are you looking? [man] What the hell...? [Simo] Hey! What are you arguing about? -[indistinct talking] -[Simo] Quiet! [man] Quiet! Hurry, come on! Wow! Seventy-five kg? Don't make me have to cut your legs off! -Stay focused, Jack! -I know. [Bunny] Big sis, are you going for a run? Wait up! Put this in my locker for me! Simo, I am going for a run! [lively music playing] [man 1] It's all your fault [man 2] I couldn't care less [man 1] It's you who made me fail. [man 2 ] Shit. [man 1 ] Check out the babe. -[man 1] Let's see what we got. -[man 2] Come on. [man 1] Hey Honey! [light buzzing] [man 1] Check it out! [man 2] Not bad at all. What are you looking at? -I can look at whatever I want! -No, you can't! -[Lily groans] -[exhilarating music playing] [groans] [man] Are you crazy? [groans] Please stop, stop hitting me! [gasps] [man] Please stop! [Bunny] Sis! [grunts] [grunts] [shouts] Sis! It's me! [Lily's voice echoes] Let go of me! Stop! He's robbing me! No, please stop! [music fades out] [sharp inhale] You had no business tagging along. You could have been seriously hurt. [pained groan] That temper of hers... No one can control it. Come on, what now? [sighs] -Simo. -Huh? I will go check on her. -[gentle music playing] -[Jack sighs] [groans] [sighs] I thought I smelled cigarettes on you. If Simo found out, she will ban you from teaching Jujitsu! Why don't you go tell her then? I am not a rat. But she's right, you know. I knew you would say that, you just sat there while she berated me. I have been a blue belt for five years. She knows I am battle tested. She just won't promote me. [sighs] After Master died, Simo stopped promoting all together. Is getting a purple belt really that important? I already dyed my hair purple just to match! Gosh! It's time to let go. [bright music playing] [sighs] Honestly... you want to blow off some steam, I get it. I completely understand. But... you can't let Simo find out. Okay? Wow, you are not even worried about my safety! Worried for what? You have been a blue belt all these years. I worry about the perverts more than I do you! I am about to enter the cage, I need to stay focused, okay. Hey, that's not fair! You can't put that weight cutting stuff on me! [sharp inhale] [clicks tongue] It's been tough. Working during the day, then classes at night. I only get to train at night. [sighs] I am still not on weight yet. I am an ass, I know. I told you to quit your job. I am working at my brother in law's company now. I got a week off to be with you. -What more do you want? -Don't lie to me! I am not lying! Your sister called me, said she fired you! She warned me... if I don't put a ring on your finger, then I should let you live the life you deserve! [sighs] You can do so much better than me. I have no right to make you struggle with me. Jack Chiu! You listen carefully! Don't think you can push me away with that crap. I knew the day I met you, this is all an act. I know how important I am to you, even if you won't admit it. So, go ahead, call me bitch in front of the students. I don't mind. [sighs] I don't care if you win 49 fights or lost 49 fights. I will always be by your side. I will always love you. You can't run that easily. [chuckles] -What are you laughing about? -[blowing noise] [sighs] Awesome. Hey! You two love birds! Just keep it clean! No boom boom before big fight! You will be weak in the knees! Simo! I got it! Will be weak in the knees. Simo made a great point just now. It's been awhile since we had made boom boom. -Go boom yourself! -How about this? We do a little role-playing game. I will be a pervert, you will punish me. How do you like that? -You like that? -[giggles] -So, you are a pervert? -Yes. And what do you want me to do? Uh... -How about a triangle choke? -[laughs] Lay it on me! Do it to me! I am all yours! [Jack] Arm bar me! [Jin in English] Kick, come on! -One, two! -[gloves pounding] Come on! One! One! One, two, three, four! Hurry up! Cross, one, two! Hands up! Hands up! One two! Hands up! Move, move! -One, two! -[gloves pounding] Hey! [Simo cheering] We have a special treat for you today! I have invited Sanda Champion Dixin to spar with you! [Dixin] Hi, thanks for having me! -Simo... -Huh? This chubby is not in my weight class. What? Are you scared? Me? Scared? Sanda Champ, right? I am just a beginner, I am here to learn. [birds chirping] [whooshing sounds] You can punch harder if you like! [both grunting] [grunts] [groans] [grunts] [grunts] Get back in there! -He really is a treat! -[Dixin] Did I hurt you? [grunts] [Jack mumbles] [crowd] Whoa! [man shouts] [grunting] Stop! Okay, okay... Sparring match is over. -A round of applause for Dixin! -[crowd cheering] Thanks for inviting me. Sorry about that. Thank you. [tense music playing] Simo, I am not done yet! Bunny, get in here! Who? Me? [Simo] Five minutes! Only punches, I don't want to see any blood! Keep calm, you know how his temper is Man, give him the four ounces. Let's see what you street brawlers are made of. Dixin, thank you so much. I wanted you to humble him a bit. Whatever I can do to help. [Bunny grunts] [Jack makes whooshing sounds] [both grunting] Simo, he's punching for real! Why are you pulling your punches? Jack's about to fight, what if I hurt him? The fight is only days away. -Take it seriously! -[pained groan] I got my money on you, Bunny! [both grunting] You bitch... [whooshing sounds] [groans] [music intensifies] [Bunny] Sorry, Bro, are you okay? I'm so sorry. [grunting] [grunts] [grunts] [pained groans] Brawling is for losers. -Do you know what MMA really is? -[groans] [both grunting] [Jack] Come on. Jack, that's enough! [groans] Hey, he's your brother! Take it easy! -You little shit! -[somber music playing] I work two jobs, teach classes every night for what? To support this gym of ours. Do you know how much Simo and Dad worry about you? They want you to make good use of your talents! What have you done thus far? Chasing tail! Underground fights! You never ask about the guys at the gym. You didn't even visit Dad! Not once! You never did! Calm down, get some rest. Hm! What's that smell? Stand up. [Simo groaning] -Did someone shit their pants? -[Simo] Hm. Bunny... Simo gets to give you a shower after all. -Ah! -Here, go on. [woman] Can't believe what they are saying about Jason! [man] This one is even worse. He asked Jason to resign. What is it? [woman] Look, the forums are attacking Jason. Let me see. We can't let them do that. Jason, the fight forum is going crazy. The trolls are attacking you. Let them write what they want. [sighs] I don't care about things like that. Let them. Let them? -[whooshing sounds] -We will fight back! [both grunting] [referee] Stop! [audience cheering] Sis, Jason has really improved as of late. [clicks tongue] You broke his arm with that Kimura lock. He will be ready for your submissions this time. Then we attack the arm again. Trick him into worrying about his right arm. Give me your arm! We fake the armbar. -[grunts] -Then when he overcompensates, we switch to the rear naked choke. [grunts] [Jack coughing] Jack, throw a left hook at me. [sighs] [grunting and groaning] Ouch! Dad! Groin kicks are fouls. So, I lose a point. But I ruined you for the rest of the fight. How many times have I told you? You can't plan for an opponent, you adapt to them! I got it, Dad! If I win this match, I will get to fight in the Shooto Japan tournament. If I win the belt, I get $100,000! We will get you out of this wheel chair. Don't worry. [sighs] Don't waste your money on me, I am done. If you make some money, you really should put a ring on that. Who? Lily? No, thanks! She's mean, not pretty, and she is flat-chested. I should look for another one. -Say it again, I dare you! -[groans] These gloves belonged to your Master. I kept them all these years. Now, they are yours. [gentle music playing] -Honey. Honey, don't fight him, -Huh? I will get rid of them. We welcome all challengers at this gym. Don't worry, I got it. Be over in a minute. [gloves pounding] [man grunts] Wow! Bro! You got him! [man groans] Sis! Brother just won! -He won! -[dramatic music playing] Honey! [Eric] Bro! Wake up Bro! No! Wake up Bro! Call an ambulance! Sis, they don't use these gloves for MMA. You will get staph infection from those, throw them away! Crap. [whooshing sounds] Time out. -I need to drain your cauliflower ear. -[sighs] [heavy breath] -[exhales] -So, how is the weight coming along? Not bad actually. This camp has been a breeze. Don't worry. A breeze? One week out from your fight. You should be letting your body rest. You always over train. [sighs] It's been tough on you, taking care of me. I know I can be an asshole sometimes. Really? Only sometimes? [gentle music playing] Hold still. Just apologize to your boss and get your job back. [pained moan] I have been by your side for every fight you had. Why would this fight be any different? After this fight things will get easier for the both of us. [birds chirping] [clicks tongue] All done. Since you have been a good boy today, how about a treat for dinner? I don't want a treat. Nurse lady, I have other places for you to drain. Really? -It has been bothering me -Where? [host] Welcome back to this week's Fighting Words. We are honored to have two of the best amateur MMA fighters in Hong Kong joining us. Welcome, Jack and Jason! [lively music playing] [Jason] I heard that you are working as a truck driver? Do you even have time to train? I move furniture, actually, and I don't need to train for you. Start! Take my drumstick, you need it! Jack is cutting weight, don't tempt him. -I will eat it. -[Jack] You eat again? Forty-seven... 48, 49... 50. [whooshing sounds] -[Lily] Five. -[Jack grunts] [Lily] Four. [shouting] I will finish you in one minute. One round knock out! Push. Come on! Push! [shouts] What a waste. I would spend every second of all three rounds. I will beat you so bad, you mom won't recognize you. Ladies and Gentlemen, we are in for an exciting fight! [Lily] How many left? Let's see. Seventy-two, that's close. -[sighs] -You look like a zombie. -Are you feeling okay? -I am fine. Let me take a shower first. [gentle music playing] [light music playing] [host] Are we gonna keep waiting? [Yung] I have no idea where he is. Let's start, keep it moving. Sure.

And if he misses the weigh-ins, he will be automatically disqualified. -[alarm beeping] -[Lily, knocking] Hey, time's up! -[heavy breathing] -[upbeat music] Hey, is he coming or not?

[Jin and Bunny] I want to challenge him! How many times have I told you? Martial arts is not for revenge! [Eric sighs] If you two can stand a round against him, I will consider it a win. Jack! You said it! Bunny, I got your back! -Good! -I got your back too! Didn't you hear what I said? Sis! Don't waste your time with them. You two have no chance. They will never sign the fight. Why don't you two go challenge Jet Li? Jin, shoot a challenge video for me! I will challenge Jason myself! -Mm. -[upbeat music playing] -[Bunny] Are you rolling? -Just wait... finding the focus. Hurry up! -[camera pings] -I am ready. Jason Chan, I officially challenge you to a fight. Enter the cage and fight me like a real man. You KO'ed my brother in 30 seconds, I will knock you out in three! If you won't accept my challenge then you are not a fighter... you are a wanker! [whooshing sounds] -Jason... -Hm? Bunny posted a video to challenge you to a fight. Who is Bunny? I don't know a Bunny. Jack's younger brother. What are you two still doing here? -[Jason] Coach. -[girlfriend] Jack's younger brother. They are posting videos online calling him all kinds of names. I'll fight him, I don't care. We are not fighting! Why not? -Beat him up to shut him up! -They are nobody. Jason just won his first professional fight. We don't fight amateurs anymore. -You, come with me. -Okay. Hey... [clicks tongue] Oh! Bunny! You video reached one million likes! -Come check it out! -Oh, wow! Told you your big bro is the best. You see the camera work? -Sure. -Nice! So, I get a cut of the likes? Sure, but technically, if there was money, -it should go to me and her. -That's right. But I am the guy in the video, I should get the money. It doesn't matter who is in the video, because I shot the video. [Jack makes whooshing sounds] Jack, Master Yung from Shooto called. He said your fight went viral online, he wants to do a rematch. Good! [grunts] I just said good, now what's your problem? [somber music playing] [in English] Okay! [whooshing sounds] [tense music playing] [Jin] Man, what is going on? What are we doing here? It doesn't matter, you have any money bro? Sure, couple of bucks. What do you need it for? Nothing, I just need to pay someone back. -Be quick. -I will be quick. [light music playing] Hi, I would like to join the gym. -[woman] Sure, let me give you a tour. -Okay! [woman] Please, this way. Welcome to our gym. We have our main training area here. -This area is for boxing and Muay Thai. -[man] Quick. [man] Slowly, slowly. [man] I'll count to three. -Weight training equipment as well. -[man] One, two, three. [man] Done. Quickly! Can I take a look around? Sure, feel free. Bro! I am filming Jason's training. [Jin] Are you crazy? Get out of there, what are you doing? Hey, what are you doing? -Are you filming us? -I can't take a selfie? Give me back my phone! Hey, give it back. That's my phone. What's going on? -She's secretly filming us. -Hey kid, you can't do that. -[man] Stop it! -Hey! Enough! [Jin] Stop! Stay calm! What's wrong. -Bro, she hit me! -Get away from her! I know you. You are from Lui Jun Sing Fight School! Yes, we are. So what? We can't be here? I don't care which gym you are from. You can't film in here. This is private property. Please leave! At least I am not like you people picking on a helpless little girl. If you want a fight, fight me! -What did you say? -I will fight you! [man] Great! Jason, we found you a sparring partner. Give him the release form to sign. -You wanted to fight! -I am not scared! Give me the 12 ounces. [girlfriend] How come? I don't want to kill him. Don't worry, sis. I got this. -Don't worry. -Don't fight him. [light music playing] [bell rings] -[grunts] -[music intensifies] Bro! [deep breath] [both grunting] [man] Bro! [panting] [grunts] [grunting] Bro! [grunts] [Jin] Jason! [shouts] Jason! Come on! [man's voice echoes] That's enough! -[voice echoes] Stop it. -Come on! [grunting] [Man's voice echoes] Bro, are you okay? -[Jin panting] -[somber music playing] Remember to tell Jack... I stood with Jason for one round! -[voice echoes] Bro! -[bell rings] Fight's over. Take him to the hospital! [Jin sighs] -Bro, are you awake? -[groans] Where am I? [gasps] How are you feeling? Does it hurt? I am fine, I feel great! [sniffs] By the way... how do I look? [light music playing] Awesome, I am posting this on Instagram! Give me the phone. -Take a photo for me! -Don't be silly. [clicks tongue] Hurry! [nurse] Sir, do you ribs still hurt? Oh, hi. [pained groan] Yes, it does hurt. Right here. -Sir, calm down. -[pained groan] -Tell me where it hurts. -It hurts. My heart... it's beating so fast. It's pounding and pounding. Is that normal? [nurse] Sir, heart beating is very normal. I think I need a sponge bath. Ouch. -How is your brother doing? -[gasps] What are you doing here? Get out of here, go! -[Jason] Calm down okay? -[girlfriend] Keep your hands to yourself! -[Man] We don't need you here, out! -[Jason] Stop. You were the one filming us in the first place! -What's going on here? -[Jack] Hey, why so noisy? Hey, you better control your people! Don't tell us what to do! -[Lily] Enough! -Get out of here, you bitch! We don't resort to violence, okay? [girlfriend] We want to see if Jin is okay. -You are not welcome here! -Get out, bitch! [Man] Don't push me! -[Man] Bitch! -[Jason] Hey! -[Jack] Are you crazy. -[Jason] Why did you hit her? -[dramatic music playing] -[shocked gasp] -[pained groan] -You are crazy. -Hey -[Jason] Put it down, calm down. I am fine. Sorry. [melancholic music playing] [Jack] Man, have you lost your mind? Bringing Jin to their gym. Look what happened now! [sighs] Don't blame her. [sniffs] You said it. It was you. You said Jin could never stand one round with Jason. Now he did it. Are you happy now? If you can stand one round with him, I will consider it a win. [man] Jack, come on, let us help. -[man 1] Take a break! -[man 2] Sit down and have a break. [man grunts] [man] One, two... -[man] Three, four... -[Jack makes "hup" sounds] -Good, right kick! Front kick! -[Jack makes "hup" sounds] -[man] One, two... -[Jack makes "hup" sounds] -[man] Block. -[Jack breathes heavily] -[man] Right kick, again! -[Jack makes "hup" sounds] -More power! -[Jack shouts] Hey! Are you okay? [panting] I am fine. -I will take a break. -Rest up. [panting] -What's wrong with your leg? -[somber music playing] Nothing. -Don't lie to me. -[gloves ripping] Ouch! [pained moan] How are you going to fight now? Stop worrying, okay! [panting] I said I am fine! Don't tell anyone about this. [pained moan] [panting] Tired? Yes. Son, if you win the lottery one day, you have all the money you need. What will you do? Why are you asking? Just tell me. -Me... -Hm. I would open my own gym, hire Simo as head coach... and get you out of the wheelchair. [sniffs] Maybe train Bunny to be a fighter. Oh. You think Bunny can be a real fighter? [sighs] It's the lottery. It's not that easy. [sighs] It's not really that far-fetched. You are already living your dream. [scoffs] Dreams, huh? Dreams don't exist when you wake up! I want what's best for Bunny. But he doesn't think so. What can I do? I know you wanted to prove yourself to Bunny. Get your rematch. You want to show Bunny you can beat Jason. But do you really think you will win? I will this time. [Simo] You know you hurt your leg. Still, you pretend nothing is wrong. I told her to keep quiet. [sighs] -She told us for your own good! -[chair clammers] Simo wanted you and your brother to be happy. She didn't care about the gym's reputation. [gentle music playing] This gym of ours... no one has ever paid tuition. It was like that when your Master was still alive. We lose money every month. The money you earned could only pay for half the expenses. The other half... the other half came from Bunny. Why would he sacrifice himself? He did it for you, your father and for the gym! You two are always on his side. I am not finished! That day you guys fought, you know what Bunny told me? He said he will make more money, so we can hire a world champion to become your full time coach! [clicks tongue] I don't need his money! You see that temper of yours. Huh? It never goes away. You are stubborn just like your Master. Bunny wanted the best for you! Do as you please! [sniffs] [inhales] Brothers don't hold overnight grudges. You are his big brother. Set a good example for him. Let your little brother know fighting is not for revenge. It's not a tool to express anger. The true spirit of a fighter... You know what that is, don't you? [cellphone ringing] What now? [friend] Bunny! Where have you been? I got a fight lined up for you! Easy money. You are in, right? If you win in the first round, wait for it... three-fold! I won't fight anymore. Three-fold! I know you want to fight pro, like Jack. But Bunny, think! You are a brawler, the pros aren't for you. You owe money again, don't lie. I am not lying! I got a good fight for you! What's more... you have to remember that, the money you owed Blackie, I took care of it that day. Stop using me for your deals. Listen. I promised Simo I won't fight for you again. And don't worry about the money, I will pay you back. Don't worry. That's it. [music] [reflective music playing] [Eric] You are his big brother. Set a good example for him. Let your little brother know fighting is not for revenge. [whooshing noises] [Jack] Everyone! I will be stepping down from the fight against Jason. -I won't be fighting. -Why not? My leg is hurt. I can't fight. I want Bunny... to take the fight with Jason. What? But you promised to avenge Jin! Teach Jason a lesson! Fighting is not for revenge. Someone reminded me recently about the spirit of a true fighter. We are not giving up. ♪ Staring into the mirror Within the mirror ♪ Sometimes we fall, but we get right back up. The important thing is knowing what's important to you. With courage and perseverance, we fight! Without courage or determination, we will lose. This fight... is not about my reputation. It's about the gym's reputation. I believe in Bunny! I want to train him with Simo. So he can step inside the cage against Jason. We only have two months left. Bunny has never fought a professional fight. Don't worry, there won't be a problem with Simo and me training him. Let's see if Bunny can pass the tests! -[man] Sixteen. -[groans] [man] Seventeen. -[Bunny groans] -♪ Pretending to be happy ♪ ♪ Perhaps running away is ♪ -[man] Eighteen. -♪ As attractive as the paradise ♪ -[man] Nineteen. -[groans] -[grunts] -♪ Flowing tears with all the might ♪ -[man] Twenty. -♪ No need to feel regret for me ♪ -[man] Yeah! -[crowd cheering] Step into the ring! ♪ Haven't escape, haven't escape yet ♪ ♪ Hanging through The long night until dawn ♪ -[whooshing sounds] -♪ Staying here is like in captive ♪ -[grunting] -♪ Full of questions ♪ -[grunts] -♪ Valueless body ♪ -[grunting] -♪ Will have to return eventually ♪ -Whoa! -♪ Maybe it's better to back off ♪ Bro, give me a break.

How many years has it been? Where did you go? After Master passed away, I went to Brazil. Who knew I ended up staying there. How is everyone? -Pretty good. -Sister? Seems like you have something troubling you. Is it that obvious? I am still trying to decide if I should let Bunny enter the cage. Wow, Bunny has improved a lot. If you ask me, if a person knows what he is good at, with the right type of training, he will achieve his full potential. Whether he wins or loses, it doesn't really matter. Jason... your manager wants you to fight. You know I am against you fighting that kid... what's his name? Bunny? Anyways... What do you think? It's no biggie, it's just a fight. If I win, I get to fight in Shooto Japan. There is an upside here. You better think long and hard. You are supposed to beat a street fighter, but if you lose... you will tarnish your professional record. You better take this match seriously. I will. -[Jack] Breath! -[Bunny breathing quickly] [Jack] Shoulders turn a little more. [Bunny grunts] -Okay, you decide. -[Jack] Five. -[Jack] Four. -[Simo] Sure. Three, two, one. Man! Keep going. Twist your hip. One more! [Man] Four. Five. -Six. -See you at the weigh ins. -[Bunny grunts] -[Man] Eight. Hey! Everyone! I have good news! Jason's manager just agreed. They just signed the contract! -[cheering] -[lively music playing] [Bunny] Yes! [upbeat music playing] Boss. -[boss] Everything is delivered? -Yes, all done. By the way, I need to quit. Quit? Why? -I am about to fight in an MMA match. -MMA? The ones with the guys wrestling each other? -You know MMA? -Similar to those. You should have taught me, so I can roll around with my wife. You are well trained already, I can tell. Anyways, go do your best in the cage! Put on a great fight for us guys! -You are welcome back anytime! -Okay. [whooshing sounds] Bunny, come here. What is it, Simo? Jack fights with explosive power, your style is a bit different. Your reaction times are faster than most. Conor McGregor once said, [in English] "Precision beats power, timing beats speed." Bro, you are a better fighter than me. Since you were a wee lad, you were never afraid of losing. You can find inner peace inside the cage. -Trust your instincts! -Got it, Bro! Bunny... Oh no, do I have to cut weight? Don't be silly. You are half the size of Jason. What you need is 5,000 calories a day to gain weight. -Awesome! -[Eric] What? I want muscles okay, not an ounce of fat! A lean and mean 136 pounds, son! [Eric chuckles] That would be awesome too! -Go see Chubby Ling at the market! -[Bunny laughs] No pork chops! Chicken only! Yes, muscles. [upbeat music playing] Forty-nine... 50... -[whooshing sounds] -[Jack shouts] Touch! I will find you a boxing champion to train you! [Bunny] Try again. -[boxer] Good work -[Bunny] Sister, how do I get out of a suplex? My best advice to you is... don't let your opponent take your back. Hang in there! [Jack shouts] [music accelerates] [grunts] Push! Do you want this fight or not? [grunts] Come on! [Bunny makes "hup" sounds] [Jack] Come on. [Jack] Here! [children shrieking] Come on. [children cheering] [in unison] Good work! [Bunny] Simo! [children shouting] Whoa! [applause] -Jason. -Yes? I invited two pro fighters to help you train. Coach Tony and Coach Godson. -[indistinct talking] -[Tony] Turn more! [coach] Keep pushing, maintain power! [coach shouting] [coach] Keep the tension Don't let him rest. [Jason grunts] [whooshing sounds] [coach] Right, lateral movements. [coach shouts] [coach] Maintain pressure! Coach Tony, take a break. Let Coach Godson take over. He is the same size as Bunny. [moaning] [groans] [grunts] [coach] Measure your distance! Pick your shots! Think! [coach] Go -Control him. -[groaning] Guys, maintain pressure back there! [man] Yes, sir. [grunting and groaning] -[camera shutters clicking] -You sound confident. So, how will you defeat Bunny? I knocked his brother out in 30 seconds. This time, I will knock him out in 20 seconds. Premature ejaculator! Please welcome Master Yung to begin the weigh-ins! Fighter Jason Chan, 70 kg, 155 pounds! -On weight! -[applause] Fighter Bunny Chiu, 66 kg, 145 pounds. On weight! [applause] Time for the fighters to face off! Please. What's wrong? Tell you what. I got your number. [crowd cheering] [phone ringing] [Bunny] Hey... Bunny, I know you are about to fight Jason... If you win this match... Blackie... He promised to erase all our debts. [crickets chirping] Hey! Bunny, kick Jason's ass, for your brother. Okay. [clears throats] [liquid shaking] Jack! I can't believe you are drinking again. If Simo finds out, you are so getting spanked! [scoffs] You are the one fighting tomorrow, not me. Why aren't you in bed? [scoffs] It's too early still. [gentle music playing] [sighs] -Bro... -Huh? You only lost once. Why don't you want to keep fighting? Why? Why did we end up being orphans? Getting bullied. Why didn't we have a home, parents to take care of us? [clicks tongue] If we weren't orphans, Eric would never have adopted us. We wouldn't have met Simo. You would never have gotten together with Lily. And you wouldn't have learned how to fight, just so you can protect me. Am I the big brother or are you? [laughs] You are. Of course, you are. -I know. -[chuckles] The way we grew up, it wasn't really that bad. I know that. There is no one in the world that can beat my brother. You are my hero! Don't give up on fighting! Do you know how hard it is to be your hero? How hard fighting is... Weight cuts... Jack, the fighter... It's not the real me. Don't listen to dad about 155 pounds. You are too tall to be in lightweight. You burn yourself out just so you can make Dad proud of you. Don't you think I know that? I didn't do it for Eric. I did it for you! I fought Jason as a professional fighter to show you, inspire you. To know that even if we are orphans, being dirt poor, living on the streets, if you can visualize it, work hard on your goals, you will succeed in anything you set your mind to! [sighs] I am not giving up fighting. Growing older made me realize what's more important. Fighting isn't the only thing that makes me happy. I have always wanted to have my own family. It's more important than anything right now. [chuckles] If I beat Jason tomorrow I get to fight in Shooto Japan. If I win four more matches, I will get $100,000! Then I can help ease the burden a little bit. How do you know you will win all your fights? -Come on, Bro. -[chuckles] Of course I will. How much is $100,000 in Hong Kong dollars? -How would I know? -[laughs] [sighs] I never think about losing when I fight. I know it's just street fights, but every time I step up against someone, I think about the same thing. If I were you, how would I fight to win? Every time I think about that, I know I can win. [chuckles] You little shit. Cheers to that! [relieved sigh] [sighs] I know it has been tough on you. I am sorry. What are you sorry for? Everything that Master couldn't achieve, and everything that I couldn't achieve... I know you will. -Yes. -[chuckles] Last beer before bed, okay? -The Kingdom, the power, the glory... -The Kingdom, the power, the glory... -For ever and ever, -For ever and ever, -Amen. -Amen. [calming music playing] This belongs to you. My God... Is the same as your God. [clicks tongue] [clap hands] -[Jin] Everybody scream! -[exhilarating music playing] [in unison] Bunny, Bunny, Bunny! -[crowd] Bunny, Bunny, Bunny! -[Jin] Louder, please. [crowd] Bunny, Bunny, Bunny... You can do it! [laid-back music playing] Teeth. [inaudible] Knock him down. Big Sister, the fight is about to start! -[upbeat music playing] -Sister... [crowd] Bunny, Bunny, Bunny! Bunny, Bunny, Bunny! [crowd] Bunny, bunny! [grunts] Don't play his game. -Knock him out -[Lily] Go, Bunny! [host, in English] Ladies and Gentlemen! Are you ready?

[crowd murmuring] [dramatic musical echo] [panting] -Bro, his punches are too powerful. -So are my punches. You can take my punches, can't you? Keep pushing forward, you got this kid. -Hm. -Attack and retreat, pick your shots! [referee, in English] Seconds out. Seconds out. Seconds out. Second round. Are you ready? Are you ready? -[bell rings] -Fight! -[exhilarating music playing] -[both grunting] [crowd exclaiming] [grunting] -[grunts] -[crowd gasps] Whoa! [grunting] -[mumbles] -[woman screams] -[Jason grunt] -[crowd exclaims] Whoa! [grunting and groaning] Trap his right arm! [grunting and groaning] [pained groaning] [grunting and groaning] [Jack] Ten seconds, hang in there! Bunny! Don't fall asleep. [Bunny chokes] [Bunny chokes softly] -[timekeeper] Three. -[quick breathing] [timekeeper] Two. -One. -[referee] Stop! [Bunny coughing] -[panting] -Sit, sit. [crowd cheering] Fighter, how many fingers am I holding up? -One. -Good, how about now? -Three. -Okay! [Bunny panting] What's wrong? Bro, I can't see very well. [panting] Okay, hang on. [pained groan] -Hang on. -[pained groan] -Relax, fight like you did in the gym. -[panting] You got him rattled, just let it flow. And remember, don't let him take you down. You are the badass fighting king, right? -[heavy breathing] -Stand and bang with him! [Bunny pants] [referee, in English] Final round! Step back, step back! Are you ready? Ready? -Fight! -[bell rings] -[exhilarating music playing] -[crowd cheering] [crowd whistling] [both grunting] -[crowd cheering] -[grunting] [Jason grunting] [referee] Stop! Yes! Yeah!!! Good kick! Stop! -Time out! -[shouts] He hit a downed opponent! -[Bunny shouting] -[crowd cheering] Yeah! I won! Bro, Simo! I won! Shut up. It was a foul, point deduction. You can't soccer kick a grounded opponent. -It was a foul, -[Blackie] What happened? You can do anything you want in MMA, right? Blackie, it's not over yet. [man] Why not? -Come here. -[man] Hey! -What the hell is going on? -[in English] Step back. -Step back, step back! -[crowd cheering] Judge... soccer kick to a down opponent, one point! [crowd exclaims in disgust] [crowd] No, right? [man] We won. [exclaiming in disgust] Point deduction in the third round. He will lose by points. Bunny won't win by points. He must knock him out this round! [in English] Ready? You ready? -Fight! -[exhilarating music playing] [both grunting] -Bunny! Get up! -Bunny! [Simo] Now! Stand up, up, up! -Get up! -Hurry. [Simo] You can do it! [Jack] Get up! [in English] Fight! Bunny! Don't let him take your back! Keep it up, Jason, you got this! He's done! [dramatic musical sounds] -Damn it! -[crowd cheering] -[Jason grunts] -[dramatic echo drowning out music] [voice echoes] He's open, slip to the right! [pounding sounds] -[coach, echoes] Come on! -[girlfriend, echoes] Keep going! -[grunting] -[crunching punches] [crowd cheering] [uplifting music playing] -[coach] Jason! -Jason! Stop! -What a punch! -[crowd cheering] [cheering] I told you! I told you he'll win! -[crowd cheering] -[shouts] -[shouts] -[crowd cheering] -That's my boy! -[Bunny] Amazing! -[crowd whistling] -[uplifting music playing] [Bunny shouting] How soon can Bunny fight again!? Soon! Next month, in Japan! -Japan! -[Blackie] Go to Japan! [Jason] Oh, okay. -What happened? -Nothing, you're fine! -Why did they stop the fight? -Nothing. [inaudible] Fighters. [in English] The winner in the third round by knock out! Advancing to the Japan Shooto competition! From the red corner, The Energizer Bunny, -Chiu Wai To! -[crowd cheering] -[in unison] Yeah! -[upbeat music playing] [crowd cheering] [inaudible] [crowd] Bunny, Bunny, Bunny! [in English] There was a lot of animosity between the two teams, leading up to tonight's fight. But now that it's all over, how do you feel? [in Cantonese] I just want to say, even though we grew up in an orphanage, we were poor and had to sleep under a bridge, with hard work and dedication, we can be champions! [crowd clapping and cheering] [crowd] Bunny! Bunny! Bunny! [shouting] Everyone! This is the final match of today's competition! Last two blue belts, Sindy and Lily!

[speaking Japanese] What does that mean? Means awesome! Wow... Awesome. -What's wrong? -So many fighters here, I am nervous. Nervous about what? [Bunny] You can even get a massage! [both laughing] -Look at this place! -Hundred thousand US dollars! [referee speaks] [commentary in Japanese] [bright music playing] -Hi! Master Eric! -Oh. -Peanut. -Thank you. [commentator speaking in Japanese] [cheering] [commentator speaking in Japanese] [in English] Please touch gloves and go back to your corner. [referee] Fight! -[bell rings] [Dixin] A professional fighter's life is not for everyone. The happiness you feel after winning, the feeling of hopelessness after a loss, only you yourself know about the feeling. I cannot be half the person I am today without the help of my coach and my teammates. Most importantly, my girlfriend who supported me all these years. It's not important whether you win or lose. What is important is I will keep challenging myself. I have set a new challenge for myself. I have built my own MMA Gym.
