That's gross put it away coward fine to thank you for backing me up for the last 3 years the concert of Tom Chang the tickets are my treat hey, Emma well do you really have to go to the audition? Of course it's tetsuya komuro going out again can't you stay home for a change? Drinking everyday are you done? Are you even listening to me? Let them finish it I can't help it they want me to go together why do you have to drink for doing business? Nonsense drinking all day long you think your body can take it? Why don't you ever listen to me? Hey you don't have to win at everything of course I have to win Do you know when I failed the high school exam they didn't speak to me for 6 months at that time only the songs of Tom Chang are there for me making me feel less alone so these 2 tickets are very important my mom she collects all my prizes and trophies she seems to care about me a lot but what they really cared is my image in their expectation so I have no choice I can only keep winning I have to be the pride of this family hey you don't have to care what others think I don't care about them I want to win too what about them? Do they know you are going to the audition? I would not let them know when the time comes I will show them the plane tickets and say dad mom I will be walking my own path in Japan this is how good your daughter really is Dad mom you're home mom sorry I am late mom you hair is so dark you looks very pretty give me a hug what's going on with you? Being so kind all of a sudden have you done something bad? Come on have some fish soup don't get your hopes up it's just fish soup again it will make you smarter what's wrong with that? Having a fish head there is what's wrong it makes me lose all the appetite without the fish head the soup won't be so good anyway, I just don't like it it's staring me in the soup leave it if you don't want to eat it I will save it for my son later dad look how handsome you are with the posture and all that you get that pretty face from me your mom's gene won't cut it Mr. wang you are having none of the soup today I will most definitely have it smart ass Shota no shhush/ so I really did want to be a chef before Tom Chang One flower and one leaf what does that even mean? Have some while it's still warm it would be less tasteful when cooled don't leave it cooled I haven't had the soup for a long time mom it's so delicious I will come home a lot more often you just had it yesterday what are you talking about? Hey Emma is going to that audition thing right? If she wins we will have a famous friend tell Emma that Mrs. wang wish her the best go for it It's almost 12, go to bed just a moment One flower for one night the blossom is the most beautiful moment Good morning thanks you bought flowers too ya I buy it everyday so the old lady can be off work early oh right, Emma the audition is postponed it rescheduled to tomorrow tomorrow? Why didn't I know about it? Because I signed up for you they called my cell phone to inform me you have a cell phone?

Run and take me away out of this polluted earth run and take me away out of this mundane life the dark sky and dark nights are eating up my dreams the ongoing wars and killing are wiping out my friends no need for wealth no need for power free of this material world take me to the moon where the air is thin take me to the moon where the bumps are steep take me to the moon let the gravity levitates us wandering in a land of wilderness with no goddess in sight I would still turn away from earth place my hope in the whole universe
