Signed, sealed and delivered. I'll take it. Oh, no, you don't. We'll put it in here where we can all watch it. All right, let's hurry to Fairport and record the deed. What's the hurry? There's more suckers here who want to sell oil land cheap. Hey, look out for those men. [HONKS] What's the matter with you guys? Look where you're going! [GRUNTS] [BARKS] Am I burned up. Here I was dreaming of a nice Porsche and a roast chicken and dumplings. What's that for? For not dreaming enough for the both of us. Mm... Why, you... Hey, spread out, you guys, I think I see a meal. Where? Where? [CHICKENS CLUCKING] Oh, boy, hand food. [CLUCKING] Hey, Plymouth Rock, get going. Come on.

Listen, squire, we're hungry. Can you give us something? Oh, you're hungry, huh? Well, go saw up some of that wood, and I'll give you something to eat. Come on, boys, work to do. Mm! Go on, saw that wood now. Lot of pep. Hey! Get busy! Okay. Oof! Think I'm scared of labor? You could do better, I suppose. All right, wise guy, you wanna do all the work? I'll watch. Where's my hat? Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, look. Look at that saw. See if it'll work. Oh, look at those teeth. Moe! Moe, please! Look, uh-- No, Moe! Moe! I'll get you. No, Moe, don't. Listen, Moe, please. Don't do it, Moe. Oh! I'm sorry, Moe. I didn't mean it. It was a coincidence. If I didn't need you, I'd exterminate you. Oh! Get a hold of that saw, we gotta fix it. How? How? We'll break it in half and move the handle up to here. Bring it back, now. [GRUNTS] It won't work. Nyuck, nyuck-- Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, I'm dead, I'm dead. Say something. Speak to me, kid. Tell me your name so I can tell your mother. My mother knows my name. Oh, playing possum, eh? Oh, oh, oh. Get up out of there. You're gonna fix that saw, you half-brother to a weasel. Listen, you. On behalf of the weasel, I resent that. Come on. Oh! Talk to your superiors like that. Come here. Cut this saw in half so it'll work. How am I gonna cut it in half? Use the little saw. Oh. [CHATTERS] [HUMS] Gee, where'd you get the egg? Right here, made to order while you wait. Ain't it a beaut? [MAN WHISTLING] Well, hello, boys, how are you? How are you getting along? Well, it's pretty hard work. Ah, come on, come on, brace up. [HUMMING] Why, I... Hey, you. What do you think you're doing there? I'm sawing a saw in half with a saw, see? [GASPS] Hey, you've ruined my saws. Don't get excited, you can still use it for a cheese knife. Now, listen, you birds. You're gonna pay for these saws. Now, get over there and load that wagon. Anymore damage, I'm gonna have you thrown in jail, see? Get going! Hey, wait a minute. Hey, lunkhead, get under there and fix that door. Whoo! Ooh! Whoa! Hit me when my back is turned, eh? [GRUNTS] Wouldn't hit me in the face, would you? Oh! Ooh. Took me illiterately. Mm! MOE: Hurry up with that, will you? Okay, fellas, let it come-- Oh!

I'm so aggravated! Moe, Larry! That looks like oil property. Yeah, just crying for a new owner. I still think we ought to be in Fairport, recording that Jenkins deed. Ah, you ain't got no patience, sourpuss. If you guys would only listen to me once in a while-- How do you like that. I haven't got enough trouble. Wow, wow, wow, wow. I can't go another step. My feet are killing me. Mine too. Boy, are my puppies yelling. Oh, mine too. Oh. Oh, take it easy. Take it easy, Fido, take it easy. What? Ruff, ruff. Gee, I wish we had a car. Wishing. Always wishing. What does it get you? Nothing. You never can tell when a-- Hey, fellas, look. Can it be? Yes! Oh, boy, I got my wish. It came true. How do you like that? But I didn't wish for no derby. Never look a gift horse in the puss. You know, I think I was born to be rich. I wish I had a cigar. Look. Are you a wishing wizard? Cigars! Whoo! Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Mm, what a bouquet. Mm, smells like a chrysanthemum-um-um-um-um. Hey, don't look now, but I think we're about to be killed. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. ALL: Hey! MOE: Grab that. [TIRES SQUEAL] You know, if I wasn't so weak from hunger, I'd bat your brains out if you had brains. You, punch-drunk, I'm hungry. Do something about it. What? Wish, slug, wish. Okay, what'll you have? How about that roast chicken and dumplings? And some hot apple pie. Does it have to be hot? Why, certainly. Do you want him to catch cold? Okay. I wish I had roast chicken and dumplings. And hot apple pie. You ain't trying. Consecrate. Consecrate. Mm! I am consecrating but nothing's happening. Hey, pull over. Stop the car. [TIRES SQUEAL] What's the idea of telling him to stop? Maybe we can get a handout here. That's a good idea. Come on. How do you do, lady? Could you give three men a bite to eat? Why, certainly. The widow Jenkins never sends hungry men away. Come in, gentlemen. Spread out. Now, make yourself right at home. Thank you. Nyuck, nyuck. Gee, I wish she had some roast chicken and dumplings. That's exactly what I have. And I have some lovely, hot apple pie. Oh, boy. I got my wish. Nyuck, nyuck. The guy's haunted. [LAUGHING] Nyuck, nyuck. Oh, this water tastes like coal oil. Isn't it awful? It's been that way ever since the pump broke. Mrs. Jenkins, isn't there some kind of work we can do to repay you for this wonderful meal? Well, the pump does need fixing, but, uh... Men, man the pumps. [TRUMPETING] ALL: ♪ A pumping we will go ♪ [TRUMPETING] ALL: ♪ A pumping we will go ♪ Oh!

Why, you've been swindled. Who bought it? Oh, Mr. Clifford and two other men. They've gone to Fairport to record the deed. Boys, we gotta stop them before they record that deed. We can't stop them in these oily clothes. Why not? The oily bird catches the worm. Quiet. Oh! We gotta get some dry clothes. Hurry. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Put a lamp in the window, Ma.
