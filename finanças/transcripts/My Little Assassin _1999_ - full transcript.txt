Señora,Havana Libre. It was before the Hilton. Gracias, señor. Bienvenida a Havana, señora. Welcome to Havana, señora. So, you are of Canada? United States. Ah, United States. So, for what do you go to Cuba? Family. Ah, family. Gracias. De nada. [distant chanting] Thanks. What did I say? Can't sail without the captain, Papa. That's the point. We're going to be late. Keeping up on things, hmm? Are you packed? Almost. Almost packed. Almost on time. Mama! I was afraid I wouldn't catch you. You know how long it takes Papa to get ready. Did you come all this way to spy on us, my dear? I always wonder what you're up to, Heinrich. I'm just an innocent sailor. Daggers and cloaks I leave to you. Are you coming with us, Mama? Oh, no, no. I'm just here for the weekend. They're flying me out on Monday. Saving the free world again, my dear? Very noble. Marita, please hurry up. I wanted to see you before you sailed. Please get my luggage. Remember what we talked about. Is that why you're here? Well, I think it's-- Can't this wait, Alice? We really have to leave. Well, yes, of course. When you get back, you'll come down to Washington, and I'll introduce you to the division chief and when you finish your secretarial course-- Why do you both want me to be a secretary so much? Darling, it's been four years that you haven't been in school, which hasn't been my preference, but we both agree that you have to make a choice. Why? Because it's time you thought about where you belong and what you want to do. Where I belong? You're just going to float around like a vagabond for the rest of your life? Yes. Good. That's my ambition. I don't want to be a typist. I don't want to be some doctor's wife. I understand that. I don't want to sit behind a desk, and I don't want to change diapers until I shrivel up and die. Nobody saves the world, Marita. What are you doing? I'm trying to protect a country, an idea that I believe in, in whatever way I can. Whether my actions have any effect, I don't really know, but it's what I can do. It's not very impressive by your standards. I didn't say that. You're treating me like I'm your enemy, and I'm not. You could get me a job at the CIA. Take the secretarial course, and I'll see. We'd be spies together. I'm not a spy. I'm an analyst. Truce? Just tell me where they're sending you. You know I can't. Why can't I? Because I've told you so. You let me go by myself the last time. Now is different. There's the captain. Would you just ask him? All right, I'm asking. Excuse me, Captain. They aren't going to get funny on us down there, are they? Of course not. Havana is perfectly safe. Sir, what about the fighting? Dear lady, revolutions in Latin America are strictly domestic affairs. The new government is in control, and this Castro will be as pleased to see your money as President Batista. You have my word. Now, you have a wonderful evening. Thank you, sir.Enjoy yourselves. See what I'm telling you? There's nothing wrong. How can you be so sure, Papa? What if he's different? Shouldn't expect so much of people, Marita. You'll be less disappointed. Oh, that's right. I forgot. I have to grow up to be just like you. You will stay on board. Obey my wishes. [horn honks] Buenas noches, guapita. Buenas noches. ¿Qué es esto? Un recuerdo de la Revolución. Me gusta. ¿Cuánto es? Para ti, Florita, two dollars. Gracias. Muchas gracias. Cuidado. Sorry! [whistles] iAlto! I am Dr. Castro. Fidel. I am Cuba. Where is the captain? What do you want with him? We want to visit the ship. Why? Why? Why? ¿Cómo se dice? Because, miss, Dr. Castro has never been on a ship so big before. There's no need for you to carry any weapons. I speak with the captain. My name is Marita Lorenz, and I represent the commander of this vessel. And unless you give up that rifle, you're not coming on board. You have to take that off, too. Alemanita, you want me desnudo? [laughing] Chica brava, Cuba surrenders! [laughing] So, in Alemania,the women are in charge of the ships. I'm not German. I'm American. You know the Washington Senators? The politicians? The baseball team. I was going to play for them. I am the best pitcher. It's true. You see them, my young barbudos? Never have they seen such a thing in their life. Where they are from, there is no electricity, no plumbing. Some of them, they no can even read. When they are sick, no medicine. All of that, I will change. How? I make the schools. I make the hospitals. I give them the land to own, first time 400 years. I make them say be proud to be cubano. Tell me, alemanita, what do you think? I think it's important to expect the best from people, not to accept limitations. Ay, pardon me. [speaks Spanish] Where you learn to speak Spanish? Sailing around. I'm good with languages. And why you no say you're a revolucionario? What? Con permiso. Oh, I got it last night. So, today, you come join us. Me? To help me fix Cuba. What would I do? What do we do? Even we don't know yet. We're brave, muy inteligente. That is all you need. Papa. Papa, this is Dr. Castro. He wanted to see the ship. Capitán, mucho gusto. A sus órdenes. Good day. Captain, I need someone very good in English and Spanish to help me, so [speaks Spanish] is clear to the United States. I'm sure that's a wise idea. Your daughter, she's very smart. My daughter needs to apply herself. Apply? Her abilities, serve something in life. Sí,because that is what I want, for her to be my secretary. Dr. Castro, she's 19 years old. I will protect her. She will have a guard at all times. It's a very generous offer, but neither her mother or myself could permit such a thing. Please excuse me. I have to go back to the bridge. We sail in three hours. I wish you the best of luck. Mucho gusto. I've been ordered to say good night. [speaks Spanish] We just meet. I'm sorry. I wanted to hear more about what you're going to do in Cuba. Alemanita, I have so much ideas. I cannot sleep from thinking. You will see. Five years-- a new country. The whole world will look and say, "Here is the future. This is how good a people can be." I know this. I wish I could see it. Of course, you can. I want to show you. We haven't finished the tour yet. Do you smell it? It floats right out across the water. Galán de noche. That is Cuba. In English, it's jasmine. More pretty in Spanish. You stay here. I can't. Yes. You help me. Dulce, mi cielo. Dulce, querida. You know these words. Say you'll come back, prométeme. Promise. Because, alemanita, this is where you belong. Man: The next exercise is designed to help you increase both comprehension and speed. Imagine your employer has called you in for dictation of the following letter. [doorbell buzzing] Dear Mr. Harris... Yeah? Hernando: Marita Lorenz? Who's this? I'm Hernando Figueroa, junior attaché to the Embassy of the Republic of Cuba. What did you say? I'm Hernando Figueroa. No, about Dr. Castro. He-- you're to be his secretary. Who told you that? Is this not correct? No. Yes. I mean, yes. Yes, it's correct. There's a government plane, and we have a car waiting. Please?Right now? We will wait if you need your bags. My parents. I'm sorry, miss? I should tell my parents. They're not here. They're never here. You are alone? Yes. From Dr. Castro. Qué linda noche. Sí. I'll be right back. [crowd shouting] Why are they so angry? They are the landlords, señorita, and Fidel has cut all rents by half. They don't like it. This is where he lives? Sometimes. [Spanish music playing] Man: Mira, Raul! Mira, mira! That's what I'm talking about! Let Che handle the bank and we'll be in charge of reform! Fidel: No quiero ser presidente de la reforma. Man: We cannot keep sitting on the fence! We have to make a decision internationally! You keep pushing me into this, you know what they're going to do in the United States? What? They're going to send in the ships and the marines! Sí, sí, muy bien. Entra, entra. Señora, siéntese aquí, por favor. All I'm saying is that we do not have a political structure in place! The communists fought with us in La Maestra. Tienes razón, Raul. We need an effective method of organizing. You don't have an opinion? It's better to be right than to win. Sí. What the hell does that mean? You know what is bothering El Che? He goes to his pretty beach house with his pretty mistress, but he cannot get rid of his fat wife. [laughing] Es verdad, es verdad. That doesn't change the nature of revolution. Oh. You know what I'm going to do? You're going to help me finish this report. No, no, no, no. I'm going to-- I'm going to-- Juggle? ¿Ve? Ve? See? Someone who understands me. Bueno, chicos. Who wants to go to the Tropicana? Camilo's always good for a party. Yo voy. Raul: We need less partying and more work around here. Juggle, juggle. Pretty soon all the balls are going to come crashing down. Marita, this is my little brother Raul, who is thinking all the time. Mucho gusto. Encantada. Tomorrow, a television interview at 2:00. We haven't met. You cannot be late. Then a meeting with the landowners. Oye,Celia, I have such a headache this morning. What did you eat? Nada. Then what do you expect? Eat something, chico. Who's she? Celia? She's my secretary. I thought I was your secretary. You? You are my angel... ...come down from heaven, and now here you are to save me. Hola, Marita. Marita: Hola. Señora Sanchez, where is... Fidel? There's three answers to that question. Where he should be, where you think he might be, and where he is. Why do you come to Havana? Because I believe in what he's trying to create. And what is that? A better life for the Cuban people. And you think the Cuban people are waiting for a little American girl to help them? No, but I'd like to try anyway. Will you promise me something? What? You and I, we have to take care of him. You've seen how he is. Can't even match his socks. So, will we be enemies or will we help each other? Help each other. ¿Desayuno? Señorita,breakfast? I would like a glass of milk. Glass of milk. And a donut. That one. No, that one.You're room 2415? How did you know that? Dr. Castro, he tell me, "Epifano, you take care of her." Thanks. American? Yeah. Be careful about what you get messed up in. I don't appreciate strangers-- If you get into trouble, I can help you. Help me? How? Remember what I said. Your life may be in danger. Raul: Just tell me I can go ahead. I'll have every casino in La Havana shut down in a week. We need the turistas. We need their money. We need to send a message to the yankees that Cuba won't be their whore anymore. That's what we need! Jesús, para. Fidel! iQue viva Fidel! Señora, ¿cómo estás? Are you listening to me? Come, alemanita. I'll show you where I belong. [applause] iMuchachos! Who is winning? Let us see what you have. iMuy bien! Dámelo. A ver, ¿eh? [cheering] We're late, we're late. Come on. Let's go. Señor! Señor! Please, señor. My son is in jail. They won't let me see him! They won't tell me what he has done! Mamita, lo siento. Señor! I have faith in you! He's only a student! Señor! I have faith in you! I have faith in you! I have faith in you! No! iSeñores y señoras! Miente. Why do we fight against corruption? Against imperialism? Against the rich feeding off the poor? Who were our enemies? The landowners! The military, the capitalists! The American President! [crowd booing] Not everyone has Cuba in his heart! What is the revolution? A uniform? A flag? The revolution is a living thing, but only as long as we believe in it! iViva Cuba libre! Libre, libre, libre! [chanting continues] Don't you sleep? When everything is fixed, then I will sleep. That woman's son, how do you know he's not innocent? I don't even know who he is. Doesn't that bother you? I was in prison. Batista put me there. He is now a millionaire in Santo Domingo with the money he stole, and the ones who kept him in power are still here-- policemen, soldiers, doctors, students. They all have mothers. Does that make them innocent? What happens to them? You don't know Cuba, alemanita. Here, you have to be strong. How are our friends in Tripoli? You're not usually waiting on the runway for my report, Harold. You know Stewart Allen? No.Stewart is FBI. Special Operations, interagency liaison. He has something to ask you. Do you know where your daughter is, Mrs. Lorenz? Did something happen to her? I'm just asking where your daughter is. She's in New York at school. And if she's not there? Why don't you just tell me what this is-- Answer him, Alice. She's with her father at sea. I'd like you to look at something, please. These were taken two weeks ago in Havana. Recognize anyone in the photos? This is Fidel Castro. This is my daughter. Were you aware that she had an association with Castro? Mrs. Lorenz, any prior association with him? No! Would you describe your daughter's political beliefs? Harold. Her political beliefs? She doesn't have any. You're sure.Of course, I'm sure. She's my daughter. With all due respect, Mrs. Lorenz, you're not aware which country she's in. Would it be safe to say you don't know what her convictions are? Got the night off? Why are you following me? You should talk to your mother. She's trying to reach you. She's worried. How do you know my mother? We have the same boss. You work for the CIA? Let's say I'm a patriot. Then why are you wearing that uniform? Why are you? You could help your country, you know. This is my country. Little girl, you're up there alone five nights out of the week. What do you think he's doing? Folding laundry? Don't take it personal. Get yourself on the right side. I am saying how many time, as soon as we can guarantee a stable transition, there will be election. As soon as we can guarantee it. I have accepted an invitation from the American Society of Newspaper Editors... Buenas noches. Buenas noches. Fidel: I will meet with Eisenhower, and we will discuss economic... Man: What are you doing in my house? What? Get out of my house! [man grunting] Ay, Dios mío. A school teacher.Yes! Man: You're going to the wall! You're a dead man. Desgraciado.Get in there! [door closes] Alemanita, come see what I made. Butter sauce, spaghetti-- it's all you need. Have some. I just saw a man taken from his home and beaten. Come eat something. Are there executions? And what would you do to your enemies? I wouldn't kill them. Batista murdered thousands. No trials, no witnesses. You said you were going to make this a new country. And how will I do that if they kill me? Because they are trying to every day. Show them there's another way. There is what you want, alemanita, and there is what you have to do. Why aren't they the same thing? Do you think history will care? Do you think it will even notice? I'm not talking about history. I'm talking about what's right. What I leave behind is what matters. Not how, but what. My enemies are the enemies of Cuba! And when they attack me with their words, with their actions... [knocking on door] It's too late! I made myself something! It's all right, alemanita. You will see. I will make everything all right. [crowd shouting] I come to Washington as a tourist. I look forward to meeting with Eisenhower because I bring him good Cuba rum, and to say we want new relation with the United States. I tried to write. I didn't... Here I am. Your friend is meeting the Vice President right now. Why aren't you with him? I wanted to see you instead. What is it that you think you're doing? Helping the revolution. It's not yours to help. What's that supposed to mean? You have an allegiance to the United States. It's not something that you can just decide to throw away. However charming you might find Castro, he is not the savior of the Cuban people. You know nothing about him. You don't know what he's trying to achieve or what he has to fight against. Castro is a communist. His revolution has a communist agenda. He's trying to free Cuba from hundreds of years of injustice. Is that why he has executions without trials? Why he arrests journalists in his country who criticize him? Why he refuses to hold elections? He's doing what he has to do. Is that what he's convinced you of? Why did you call me? I wanted to let you know that I was all right. I'm just trying to protect you from something that you don't-- you don't seem to understand is going to affect you for the rest of your life, not to mention your entire family. Family? You and Papa don't even live together! I don't want to discuss the arrangements that your father and I-- What do you want to discuss, Mama? I have made a decision, and you can't accept it! Is that what you want to tell me? That I don't understand you? Well, I don't. I don't understand you. I'm not asking you to! I can't listen to this now! We told you this before you went away! iPrepárarte! You're right. Fine. Nixon treated me like a child. I said we needed money. They treated me like a child begging for a sweet! And the both of you, the second I get back, like two old women. So no one can say anything to you now, is that it? They won't put a penny into Cuba-- What did you expect? You tell the Americans whatever they want to hear, and then they give you absolutely nothing, nada! Don't be an idiot. Did you say a word about socialism? About real change? You bark like a performing dog! And you sit on your ass! I'm bored. The revolution is over. I can't get away from my wife. You don't have a stomach for the real fight. Maybe what you've forgotten what the real fight is. Fidel?Yes? I need to talk to you. Sí,later. When? I don't know, más tarde. Che, you know I trust you. We fought side by side. You're like my brother. Che: Fidel, you forgot! You forgot what we talked about! Raul: You got to their territory, you're in their home-- They do what they want with you. Hermanito, let's face it. the United States is never going to help us. They'd rather see us dead. All they care about is keeping their damn casinos open. We have to think of other possibilities. The Soviet Union. What choice do we have? [Spanish music playing] [speaks Spanish] [music stops] What is it? I'm pregnant. Is it mine? Yes, it's yours. Do you want to go home? I thought you said this was my home. It is. Of course, it is, but... What? You don't have time for your secretary now? Would it be more convenient for you in between meetings with Graciella and Natalia and Teresa? Alemanita... Get out. Get out. Desembarque. Enseguida, capitán. iVamos! iVamos! Trust me. Now they'll know we're serious. You read this. I thought you weren't going to do this to the tourists. Hey, hey, hey. Whoa. Hey, whoa, whoa. What's going on here? By the order of the Republic of Cuba and in respect of the rights and freedoms of the Cuban people, this casino is now closed. Can we talk about this? Your hotel can stay open. All of your equipment will be stored, and you will be given a receipt. But as of today, there is no more gambling in Cuba. Says who?Cuba says. I think you're making a big mistake here. This casino is owned by Mr. Charles Luciano. What is he? Italian? He's an American citizen with a major interest in Cuba. I suggest that you rethink what-- what the hell is he doing? Juggling. [knocking on door] Hola, Marita. Hola. All the juggling is... very hard. Then stop. If I stop, the Americanos will send Batista back in a helicopter, and to the wall with Fidel, huh? Will you miss me, alemanita? You haven't treated me right. From the moment I saw you, I could not help myself. It's all your fault. [knocking on door] Hola. Buenas noches. Where's Epifano? He's sick today. I hope it's not serious. Well, miss, God provides. Gracias. Gracias. Where am I? You're in New York. Roosevelt Hospital. A call came from the Cuban Embassy. They put you on a plane last night. They said you were sick. Sick? Septicemia. You lost a lot of blood from what they did to you. Where's my baby, Mama? Marita... Marita, my name is Stewart Allen. This is Agent Olshan, Agent Larrigoy, Federal Bureau of Investigation. I just wanted to come by and introduce myself and let you know that we're here to protect you now, and also how sorry I am. I want to see my baby. Marita, some people have done-- have been ordered to do something terrible to you. don't know how much of this you remember-- none of it, I hope, for your sake. You were given an abortion and left for dead. Your baby didn't survive... ...by order of Fidel Castro. I'm sorry. How do you know the baby didn't survive? There's evidence. What evidence? I'm sorry. There's very clear evidence. Believe me.Show me! You hate Fidel! You hate me! Darling, I love you. You all need to leave now. She has to rest. Mama! I'm sorry. You have to go. She has to have her rest. Okay. Calm down, miss. Are you okay? My clearance has been revoked. I had nothing to do with that. Either I'm running my own covert operation against Castro using my daughter, or I was leaking information to him through her. It's perfectly logical, isn't it? Well, you were OSS during the war, weren't you? Yes. American spy, living under the Reich, German husband, had a baby girl in the middle of all that. That's a lot of different loyalties. I chose the one that mattered to me. Yes, and you're going to have to choose now, Mrs. Lorenz. I won't sacrifice my child to prove what I believe in. You're not sacrificing her. You're saving her. Look, why don't you get back to Washington, D.C.? Your being here is just going to make it harder, and we'll be in touch. And if it wouldn't offend you, I'd like to put this over her bed. Marita. Let me get you a sandwich or something, okay? Get your strength back for you. How long do I have to stay here? Well, it is your house so you can do whatever you like. We're just here to make sure things are all right. I made you a little sandwich here, Marita. Some potato chips. Eat that, you'll feel better. I don't know why you'd want to go back there. You're American. It's great seeing other parts-- What if I walked away? Couldn't stop you. Might be worried about your safety, though. A lot of Cubans in New York. Let me help you.Where are my parents? Uh, your father, I believe, is aboard The Berlin. Next port of call is Rio de Janeiro. Your mother is in Washington, D.C. She's very upset with you by the way. You said some pretty harsh things. You feeling a little sorry about that now? Why would I tell you? No reason. I just hate to see a family tearing itself apart like that. You know, maybe I protect my own children too much. But then, I look at what's happening in the world, and it makes me frightened, and I just have to fight that much harder. Fight what? Let me ask you something. What do you believe in? I don't know anymore. See, that's the most dangerous situation you can be in, because then anyone with a big enough personality can walk right into your life and take it over. Is that really what you want? What do you believe in? That's a good question. For a long time, I felt like there was no place in the world for me. In fact, that's something-- something I think I see in you. You don't feel like that now? No. No, because I came to realize something I denied for a long time, and that is that God is real and present in the world, that he has plans for me. He wants me in this world as a warrior. Want some? You sure? You're fighting for God? Sort of. I'm fighting for the values of the United States, and I know in my heart-- just a second-- that communism wherever it appears is utterly opposed to those values, and, Marita, that's evil. Fidel isn't evil. Well, what do you call someone who would kill his own unborn child? He didn't do that. Listen, Marita, whether it was to keep it from his mistresses-- and we know that there are at least three others-- or because the political fallout in his own country here was too great, he behaved like the gangster and the coward that he is! I can't hear you.You know what? Your mother didn't want you to see these. But you asked for proof?I can't hear you! You said you wanted proof? All right, look at this. Your baby was born alive! Oh, my God! He was a boy! They killed him in the room. Marita, look at this. This is what the devil can do! Look at it! That's your baby! Look at that!I can't hear you! Look at it! Marita! Hold it! Hold it! Man: Are you crazy? You're all right. Come here. You're going to be all right. You're going to be all right. We're going to take care of you. Collect call. International. The Havana Hilton. [gunshots] Where is she?Over there! Marita, get down! Stay down! Get up! Come on! Go! Marita, what were you trying to do? I wanted to talk to Fidel. Don't you think he was counting on that? Don't you realize that he's just waiting for a chance to finish what he started? What do you mean? Marita, as long as you're alive, you can prove that he's not who he says he is. He's not a savior. He's not a man of the people. Fidel Castro is a liar, an adulterer, and a murderer many times over, and it's time you realize that, because the next opportunity they get, I guarantee you, they will not miss. I don't care. What are you saying? Are you telling me that you don't care about your life? No. I'm being punished. Isn't that what God does to sinners? Okay, but what if you could redeem yourself? What if you could do something that was really meaningful for your country, and for your soul, and for the soul of your baby? Would you do that? What? Do you remember what I said? That God sometimes chooses someone to be a warrior? All right, you'll be trained, and when the time is right, you will go back to Havana, and you will make sure he never, ever hurts anyone again. You want me to kill him? Marita, he's trying to kill you. He's already killed a part of you. I can't do that. Yes, you can. The thought is worse than the action. The thought holds you back. But the action, Marita, the action will set you free. Marita... ...it's exactly what he deserves. The choice is yours. It's your choice, but it's also your responsibility. What about God? Marita, we don't do what we want in this world. We do what we have to, and God understands that. And he forgives us. And God will forgive you. Where's my mother? You want to speak to your mother? Okay. All right. We can do that. I wanted to apologize for what I said. I was angry, and I really didn't know who I was angry at. We don't have to talk about it. They want me to... I know what they want. Do you know why we bought this house? The war changed things between your father and me for the worse. You were the only thing left we had in common. And I devoted myself to a cause, and I don't apologize for that, but I think... I know that I failed you. I know that. But I wanted there to be someplace that you felt was home. Well, there isn't. Well, then, you have to-- you have to make one for yourself by the actions that you take. Do you understand, darling? What you choose now is what you will be. You think I should do it, Mama? You have to find the courage to do what's necessary no matter how wrong it may seem. That's heroism. You tell them I was loyal. Who's this man?Mickey Evans. A great interest in all things Cuban, and very interested in meeting you. Mickey. Old Father Stewart. How's God? Still in business? You bet. I didn't know the museum kept night hours. Well, I got a thing about crowds. You know the major here, one of the good guys? Yeah. We met in Miami. Placer. This is her? Marita Lorenz. Mucho gusto. Mickey: Just let me say this. When I heard what that red bastard did to you, I wanted to kill him myself, and I mean that. Charlie Baron says hello. Who? He runs the Rivera down there. Said he ran into you. Are you in the casino business? No. I'm in the friendship business. I bring people together. People ought to know each other, patriotic people. Sam Giancana, Stewart Allen, the Major, Dwight Eisenhower, people like that. Senorita Lorenz, are you going to kill him? Major, can we keep the discussion on a more general basis? I told you it was a waste of time. You should have listened to me, little girl. Could have wrote it all down in your diary and married a nice dentist somewhere. But you had a better idea-- I'll just be a traitor and a whore. Keep it friendly, Mr. Sturgis. What's this Mata Hari crap? Do we take Cuba back or not? I've got 150 men on government payroll playing cowboys and Indians in the Everglades. I've got Giancana and the CIA crawling up my ass looking for results! Give me the word, I guarantee Castro's head in a box by Christmas. I'm not a whore. You want to kill somebody, don't you? Yes. That's good. We can't send you in without some kind of training. The Cubans have an army. I was with them, little girl. They come up against some U.S. mojo, they'll fold. Bet on that. So, you're going to do us all a favor, right? I've never killed anybody. I'll show you how. Let's get something straight. Your FBI girlfriend, Stewart, worrying about God, J. Edgar Hoover-- he don't have stones to jaywalk at midnight. You're with me now. I don't care about your baby. I don't care about your soul. You will do your job. Screw up, you die. Understood? Do you understand? Make yourself at home. Got some intelligence in. Castro will be delivering a broadcast on Cuban television. It's a scheduled address, so he's got to be on time. And the studio is in Havana, so in all likelihood he'll stay at the Hilton. When? Tomorrow. What is it? Botulism capsules. One's enough, two for insurance. Put them in a cold drink. Then what? Then you get out of there quickly and quietly. There won't be anything to see. It'll just be like he's asleep. Now, the CIA will be in the lobby covering you. Go to the airport, and you'll be home in 30 minutes. What if it doesn't work? Well, then you sure as hell better break his neck. [line tone] It's coming through, sir. Marita. Celia: Dígame. Celia? It's Marita. Can I talk to him? Celia: What do you want? Can I talk to Fidel? Celia: What do you want to tell him? That I'm coming home. Celia: When? Tomorrow. Stay in line. Stay in line. Great. They're checking all the bags. Gracias. You have been with some very bad people, alemanita. FBI, CIA, traitors. You think I don't know? They say you're the bad one. Do you believe them? I have to make a speech in a few hours. I need to sleep. Now you sleep. I'm so tired, alemanita. You were the only one who can keep me calm, and then you left. What happened to the baby? The boys of Cuban fathers belong to Cuba. What do you mean? Do you really think I would kill my son? I found the doctor-- Cubano, a butcher. He confessed to nothing. He went to the wall. Is my baby alive? First, you say who do you trust-- Fidel or his enemies? I don't trust anyone. Then what does it matter what I say? You have to think, alemanita, about what the bad people you are with are willing to do. What crimes? What lies to hurt me? You stay in Cuba. You rest, and then you will see, it will be all right. All right for you. It won't ever be all right for me. Pobrecita. I'll be right back. Did they send you here to kill me? Yes. You are a soldier now, alemanita. Do what you came for. You see, nobody can kill Fidel. Nobody. What's the word? It's over. Something wrong with the food? I can't eat. It's 8:30. Turn it on.Yes, sir. Fidel: Our agreement with the Soviets is good for Cuba in every respect. A million tons of sugar a year for the next four years. In the Soviet Union... I didn't do it. I could have... but I didn't do it. You stupid lying whore! You screwed us! Leave her alone. Get out. Cuba was great, you know that? Great action, dope, great skirts. Cuba was beautiful. I'm sorry. You're what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Get on your knees. Go on. You know how to do that, don't you? Come on and show me. On your knees. When you see your mother, say thank you... ...for the bullet that's not in your head. Why didn't Frank Sturgis kill me? I don't know who that is. He works for the CIA. Marita, why don't we attempt to have a civilized conversation? My baby's alive, isn't he? There's nothing to be gained-- Did they tell you the truth at the hospital? Were you lying to me then? These people, our people, are fighting a war. Do you think that they care? Do you think it matters to them what you and I haven't done? What I haven't done? What is it? What do you want to say? I just-- I just wish there was some way... What? I wish you could understand. That's all. Man: Alice Lorenz devoted her life to the preservation of the United States. She served bravely in the overseas Secret Service working under dangerous conditions within wartime Germany itself. After the war, she continued the fight to preserve the freedoms that so many of us take for granted. She was a dutiful wife, a loving mother, and was preceded in death by her loving husband, Heinrich. Marita? Yes? Left the kids at home, I see. That's probably wise, considering the complications. What do you want? You're not invisible, Marita. We know where you live. We know about your ex-husbands. We know what kind of car you drive. We know you were working at Fort Chaffee as a translator for that trash that Castro let out of prison. We like to keep you honest. Your mother wanted me to give this to you. What is it? Call it a favor. [phone ringing] [ringing continues] Bueno? Thank you. I'll be right down. How do I look? Good for an old man. They are all gone, alemanita. Camillo, El Che... Celia died last year. Broke my heart. You're still here. My doctors say not to smoke so much the cigars. I'd like to see him now. Andre! Señora,I'm pleased to meet you. I have something for you. 100 percent American, which means they were probably made in Pakistan. Thank you, señora. He's going to be a doctor. What kind? I don't know, maybe pediatrician. He's the best in his class. He knows more than his teachers. But he cannot hit a baseball to save his life. Señora, you are my mother. I want to say that I honor you. The woman who raised me... well, the woman who raised me, she's my mother, too. A grandmother from La Maestra, part of the family. She has been old forever. I'm still very proud of you, if that's all right. Excuse me, señora. I have to go to class. Why didn't you tell me he was alive? You were there to kill me. I didn't. You should stay here, alemanita. If Cuba is not your home, where then? When are the elections, Fidel? Do you miss me? You'd like that, wouldn't you? Of course. My little assassin. [PA chatter] You have a nice trip, Marita? We'd love to talk about it. It's in everyone's best interest. Yours, the country's. It's one side or the other. It's up to you, Marita. ♪ I was gambling in Havana ♪ I took a little risk ♪ Send lawyers, guns, and money ♪ ♪ Dad, get me out of this ♪ I'm an innocent bystander ♪ ♪ Somehow I got stuck ♪ Between a rock and a hard place ♪ ♪ And I'm down on my luck ♪ Yes, I'm down on my luck ♪ Well, I'm down on my luck ♪ I'm hiding in Honduras ♪ I'm a desperate man Man: That's a gimme?
