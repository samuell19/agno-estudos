That was the latest drop from D and Y. Please. Y'all make sure to go cut that out. It's a hop and speaking of hot as hell, isn't it usually one winter we're having this year. Well, not if you've been living in Georgia all your life. It's 81 degrees. It's a hot one right now. But not as hot as these phone lines. Cause it's time to speak out. Hello? Who am I speaking with? And what are you speaking out about? Hello. What's going on? My name is TK. I want to speak about females. Well, first let's learn the proper term, my man. Female is an adjective. Woman is a noun. So they're not females, they're women. Females. Women. A little but they are all confusing. Anyway, I asked my lady what she wanna do for her birthday. She said nothing. That's exactly what I did. Nothing, that's all I want to talk to you brother. Alright, TK. I'm going to keep it a book with you. It sounded like you fell for the age old trick. When a woman says she was nothing on her birthday, what she's really saying is that, even though she doesn't want anything, just didn't want you to show her that you love and that you appreciate her, even if she's not particularly expect me, it sounds like you've got some making up to do my man. All right, that's my time. This is DJ Rain. Always raining down to hits. Before I get up out of here. I want to wish you a very special, special, happy birthday to my queen Simone, happy birthday baby. I love you. And I can't wait to celebrate your special day with you. ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ Happy birthday dear Simone, ♪ Happy birthday to you. Ooh lady. All right. Simone, I love you so much. I love you with all my body, my heart, my soul, you my everything. I can't imagine my life without you. Now I want to know, nothing more of me, because you are more special, so I can make my Christmas wish come true. What do you say? You want to get married? Yes. Just not to you? Damn. Is anything just happened? Nah, nah, that ain't just happened. Somebody pinch me, because I must be dreaming. The hell man. Nope. You're awake. Please tell me not just propose to my girlfriend. And she said no. Actually you said, do you want to get married? And she said yes. But not to you. Fred. Freddy. What? I just want my boy to have all the facts. You not helping, come on. Hey. Look man, I know this really isn't a time when I told you so, but I told you not propose to that girl. No you didn't. Okay. No, but if you would've told me what you were going to do, I would have told you not to do it. You helping this man or not. Move, move. I'm just saying. Just move on. Listen. Bro, I know you're hurting right now, we're going to look back at this moment and just laugh, you see what I'm saying? And today is not that great. Okay. Rain. I know that it might not seem like it, but today is actually the best day of your life. Was she at the same party we were at today. I say that, because now is the time that you can truly find yourself and now you can truly figure out, what you really want in a partner. And when you figured that out, the right one would be right there. And what are you doing? Calling Simone. No, hell no. Give me that phone. Baby, please don't leave me. Baby look, I need you. Like I'm begging like. Baby please don't leave me. What do you want me to do? I'll do, I'll do anything that you like. Ooh. Just please don't leave me. Get that phone.. Please. Oh, girl. Give me that phone. Why can't you just ope your phone man. Now it's time to call the night. Look, I need that. I need to drive my pain away. Just give me the phone. Let's go. Calm down, it's okay. . Damn. Feel bad for him. He is sad. Yeah, me too. Is this okay now? Come on man. No. Do you have anything? Okay, all right. Yap. I just wish, I just wish that women be like you. Not with him but me. Always, always there for me. Love me no matter what. Why did she say no? Why did she say no to me? She probably, she probably realized that, that she wasn't the right one for you. When I know I might seem like you now, but Simone did you a favor. She released you to find the woman that God created just for you. You are one of the most kindest, the sweetest, most loving people I have ever known. I remember when we were in second grade and I accidentally got glue stuck in my hair and you thought it would be a good idea to try and cut it out. Leaving a big ass hole in my head. Man, I was so mad, but what did you do? You let me cut a big hole in you hair, so we be even. You are good man. And you deserve to have a good woman to love you. Like you deserve to be loved. Okay. Goodnight friend. Damn. What did I drink? Hey, baby you'll never believe the dream I had last night. I dreamt I proposed to you and you, said no. One more tequila for me. ♪ I always in a studio. ♪ Every other day. ♪ Every other day, ♪ I never get tired of you, ♪ Yes what she said ♪ But it's not even like that ♪ So why would you think that. ♪ She said it feel like, ♪ Your music comes before me. ♪ She said ♪ You could love me ♪ Like you do music, ♪ Then we go be fine, ♪ Ooh we go be fine. ♪ If yo could love me, ♪ Like you do music, ♪ Then we go be fine, ♪ Ooh we go be fine. ♪ She said eh. ♪ Every time we talk, ♪ Is always about you day. ♪ Music, ♪ It's only to you, it's in me. ♪ What about me? Crazy. I heard it was awful. Turn him down flat in front of everybody. So it's probably safe to assume that maybe Zack would be here today. So my have you feeling. Rain? Yes boss. What are you doing here? I have a show to get ready for. I mean, after last night I just assumed. Well, you know what they say about people who assume, right? And I'm not gonna say cause the boss trying to kill this job always. Look, Rain. Are you sure where you should be here right now? I mean, after what happened, maybe you should take a few days off. Look boss. I appreciate you looking out for me. The bills still got to get paid. And love and heartbreak. Ain't gonna pay the bills. You feel me? Now, if you excuse me. I have a show to get ready for. Yeah, that was a throwback during the day. And now it's time everybody to think for a second. Speak out. This is your chance to speak about anything you want to. Nothing or no one is off limits. So with that being said. Let's have first call. Welcome to the afternoon drive with DJ Rain live. Who am I speaking with? My name is Portia. Yo, what's good Portia? What are you speaking out about today? Well Rain, I've been dating my boyfriend for about four years now and he just recently asked me to marry him, but I haven't given him an answer yet. I mean, I love him, but I just don't think we're ready to get married yet. Oh, damn. What do you mean? You don't know if you're ready to get married yet? You've been together for four years. How much more time do you need? I just want to make sure before I made that leap, you know what I'm saying? No, I don't know what you're saying. I need to talk to you about this account man. Hey man, don't you see I'm doing something. Sounds like me, mans heart. You just big let down, and a major heartbreak. You know what? It's bitches like you to get in my damn nerves. You got a good man, but instead taking a live with him you just decide to throw him away like he ain't nothing. How about you just do everybody else a favor and find the nearest cliff and take that leap. Hello? Hello? Damn Rain. Yes, you hung up. I guess the truth just got too real for her ass. Listen, it's time to have a music break. And I know we supposed to play some more Christmas music but if I get my jingle bell right and nobody else did. So with that being said, this next genre is dedicated to all you whore whore out there. Especially the ones who decide to leave a good man during the holiday season. You know after this genre we go follow up Chris Brown. This hoes ain't loyal. 'Cause they ain't. Oh, yeah. It's getting really up in this bitch. Hello? Yeah. I heard the show. What are we going to do now? Jimmy just continue to apologize to the listeners and let them know that we are handling the situation. Come in. Thanks Jemmy. Have a seat. I'm good standing. Fine. Have you lost your damn mind? Who the hell are you to be going on live like that on the radio? And because of your shit, our phones are blowing up with offended listeners. Plus I got the FCC on my ass now. What do you have to say for yourself? And look women are bitches. Okay. And bitches are evil. I understand you're dealing with your heartbreak. I told you to take a few days off. But you were insisting on not doing so. So with that, you should have checked that shit at the door before you got on the air. I'm sorry. So am I. That's why I'm going to have to suspend you indefinitely. Without pay, until we decide if we want to keep you or not. Look, you can't do that. Okay, I have a contract. If you read page three, paragraph four, you'll see that I am in every legal right to do what I just did. Poor Rain. I can't believe he went off the rails like that. I know right? He should do that more often. 'Cause that was one of his best shows yet. I mean poor, poor, Rain? You know, I blame Simone for all of this. I should go to her house and bump that half in the face of what she did to my... Your, your what? Friend, friend. That's what I was getting ready to say before you rudely interrupted me, Listen, girl bye. Instead of trying to fight Simone and catch a case, you need to be taken all of that pent up aggression and putting it on Rain. Caroline, stop it. I told you Rain and I are just... - Just friends. - Just friends. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Save it for somebody with baby milk still on their bread. Girl, I could tell you got a bang for Rain and anyone who has eyes can tell that you two have a connection. Well clearly I need to get my eyes checked because Rain doesn't see me like that. Alexandria. See that's the thing, Rain doesn't see me as Alexandra, to him Aj. I mean we grew up together. I'm always around him and his male friends. So, to Rain I'm just one of the fellows. Well maybe if you stop acting like one of the fellows, he'll take the scales off his eyes and finally see you as the woman of his dreams. ♪ Sleepless nights, ♪ Hell of a time, ♪ Where are your arms ♪ We are two in this flight, ♪ Whose side I'll go live ♪ When I shot the man right ♪ It's not all right. Good game fellows. Yeah. Woo. Yeah. And Aj. Has anybody had from Rain since the proposal hit. He hasn't been answering my calls or text. Yeah, mine either. Well I went to spy after he had that melt down on the radio last week. He's a complete wreck. Oh, how bad is he? It's so bad. Rain is looking for somewhere else to stay. We gotta do something. What do you think we should do? Okay, what I think that we should probably. I mean, I think we should set them up on a whole bunch of dates. That's not the route that I was particularly thinking about taking. I mean, they say the best way to get over someone is to get into someone. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean, we should each find a woman that he liked. He'd go out with a different woman each night. I mean he's bound to find one of he liked, right? Yeah. I think this could be super clutch because of. Hey, let's do it. I mean, come on fellows. Rain has been truly broken up by all of this and she just pushed him off on some random, is not going to automatically fix the situation. I mean, I mean, maybe we should think about taking a different approach. Come on. - No. - No. No, I like this. Hey, hey operation lady in the streets and freaking the sheets on three. Hey. - Freaking the. - One. - Two. - Two. Three. Three. Lady in the street. Lady in the street. No, look man. We probably should've came up with something a little shorter. Dad is saying.

Oh, and this is my princess Corona B. Now she's my heart. She really looked like me. People think we are twins. . Oh, my God! There are aliens among us. Do you wanna know how I know? Now tell me when they abducted me? I told him, if you ever cheat on me. I will kill you. So that's what I did. Well, almost. Okay. And these are my twin boys, Dallas and Dynasty. They look like their daddy, but they still cute though. Do you here that? No, I don't. What did you say? Did you say something? I said no, I don't. No, not you. I'm talking to him. Why did you say? They told me, that I was only a centimeter away from stubbing him in the heart. It's so so clear. Everything is right here. Do you want to know what your future holds? Yeah. Tell me this. Is it gonna be over? This is the first nanogram of my. What? Yeah, me and the baby we don't get a long so well. But you look like a good daddy. Do you have any kids? Yes, he is cute. I think he might be the one. Check please. Yes, . Just bring the check. No, okay. Yes, yes. . Yes. Yes. Yes. Obviously, not a good idea. See, I told you. You did. So what do we do now? I don't know. Don't look at me. Listen to me. I'm ready to listen. I'm not saying anything. - What you got? - Nothing, it doesn't even matter. I'm listening, what you got. Too late. I have what y'all hear before. Nothing. - Come on, now. - Absolutely not. What you got? Nothing. Damn nosy. Oh, who was that? Come on bro. That's one of hoes? Dude. I'm standing right here. What's your point? Show some respect.

I'm not riding with you. Come on man. . Do you want some respect? Hey you. Good morning Aj. You tell me. So, how were your dates? Who? Can't believe I let you'll put me through that. It wasn't me. It was those local friends of yours. Talk specifically to them. I tried to. But those fools ain't listening to me. Yeah. You right. Let me keep it brief AJ. Every time I breath, I see you. I don't know. I don't know. It's been three years with that woman. I gave her my heart and my soul. It's like, it's like she inhabits every cell in my body. I don't know. I don't know. It's like, it's like I feel less of a man. I feel empty. I ain't complete. Simone, she's my everything. She's perfect. Obviously she must not be too perfectly. Don't you like that? No Aj I'm not trying to get. No, no. Now you listen, and I know you loved this woman. And I know you put a lot of your heart and your time in this relationship. And I understand that it's going to take a minute for you to heal from all this but you can't let her make you feel like you are less than who you are. Less than what you deserve. You are a strong, smart, black king. And if she can't see that, then she doesn't deserve you. Damn. I think this is the nicest thing you ever said about me. Don't be used to it. But now for real take your time. The right woman will be with you when the time is right. And who knows. She might be right under your nose. Why are you looking at me like that? I got a bug in my nose? Ew. So nasty. No, but for real I'm thankful I have somebody like you in my life. I loved you and I'm forever grateful to have you as a friend. Well I love you too. Friend. I'm trying to tell y'all been practicing, man you ain't believe me. I'm getting too old for this. Whatever man. You might as well go and retire damn shoes. These are Michael's. Is officially broken. No, no. You gotta look. You got my short. Man look knee shorts. Ain't got shit to do. I was running you up and down at court. I was in that. Oh, oh bro. Pause, pause, pause, pause. Now, it's good to see you smile my dude. I mean, I know it's been rough with you losing Simone, and all that. Yeah. Crazy days making the bed. Listen man. You know you like to date? No, please? Nah, seriously don't man. I take the fall for that one, all right. My bad. It's all good. I know y'all meant well. You are my boys. For sure. I know y'all wouldn't do anything to intentionally hurt me. You are right. There is something I need to talk to you about. Hold on, did you see that? - Damn. - Damn. Damn, wow! Did you see that? Unfortunately. But her face looks like a beetle juice. Dreamboat ass, shipwreck face. Bad combination. Lord have mercy. So, what's the issue you want to talk me about? Well you don't have... Dominique. This would be one of your many women? Shut up man. Elena, what's up? Hey you. How are you doing? Doing good. How are you? I'm doing good. This is my homeboy Rain Wilkins. Rain, this is one of my former colleagues Elena McDaniels. Nice to meet you. The pleasure is all mine. Yo, Elena is one of the sharpest attorneys in the region, man. She was one of the first women to average. Okay, okay. I believe I can tell him about myself over dinner tomorrow night? Are you? Um, are you asking me out to dinner? That depends. Are you saying yes? Um, yes. Yes. I'd be on to it. Excellent. Get my number from Dominique. Text me later. And we'll discuss the dates. Okay. All right. Until then. Until then. See you later. Same. My man. My man. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah. Thanks for bringing that up. The girl was acting like having a conversation with the civil. Like she was acting out of a conversations like the damn spoon, fork and knife, when I talk back to her. What? It was crazy. Okay. That's nothing. I went out on a date once with this guy and his entire pregnant wife shows up. So, she obviously took an Uber there just to bust his ass. Oh no, no, no, but catch this, her water breaks. And apparently he doesn't have a car either, which I didn't know. So what did I do? Drove both of them to the hospital so she could have their baby. That's crazy. Exactly. One of the worst dates of my life. But I'm, I'm just really glad that tonight is panning out to be different. Yeah, me too. If I ask you something, will you promise to be completely honest with me? Depends on what you ask. No, not like that. What do you want to know? Who broke your heart. Why do you ask? I mean, behind the smiles, the laughs and the great conversation. I still see sadness in your eyes. I mean if it's too. Oh, no, no it's fine. I think I can finally talk about breaking down and crying. Her name was Simone, we were together for about three years. On her birthday, I proposed to her and she said no. No. Yeah, it was in front of friends and everything. I'm sorry. Yeah. I really loved her, you know. Like I felt like, I could spend the rest of my life with her. But I guess she had other plans. Well, that's her loss. Thank you. And her loss, is my gain. Yo, it was perfect. The way she looked at him and the way he looked at her, you could see instant fireworks. I think it would work. Definitely looked out for my boy. Good for him. Now, when are you going to come and take care of me? Oh, Not fair. We said last time was the last time. Yeah, we said that the last time before that. And then the time before that. Oh, and then that week before that we said that too. I mean, how can I resist you wearing shit like that? That is a very easy question. Because you, you don't want to? This is wrong. This is wrong Simone. Oh my gosh. Rain is one of my best friends. I mean.. And I am standing right here in front of you waiting for you to take me. It's a dangerous game. We playing Simone. Good thing I came to win. That was beautiful. One more tonight. One more tonight. It's nice. Is that Rain and his new boo? Yep. That's them. Damn she cute. I mean, not cuter than you. Don't start Caroline. I'm just saying that could have been you. Well, it's not so just drop it. I'm gonna say hey. Don't, don't. Rain? Hey, hey. What's up AJ, Caroline. What's up Rain. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's skip all the pleasantries. Who do we have here? Oh, this is Elena, my girlfriend. Hi. Nice to meet you both. Likewise. Girlfriend. And how long have you two known each other? Couple of weeks now, I suppose. Isn't that a little soon to be calling someone your girlfriend. What she means is congratulations. Glad you found someone. You deserve to be happy. Thanks Aj. You welcome. I appreciate that. Mm-hmm. Come on Rain. We should really get going. We don't want to miss our tea time. She's taking me to play golf. I'm about to get my Tiger Woods off. Okay. Yes. All right, ladies it was really nice to meet you all. Wasn't it? - Bye. - See y'all later. They were really nice. It's all good. Why did you do that? What? Gay people's gay man. She looks like she's playing for keeps. And she'll do whatever it takes to make sure it stays that way. Even if it means breaking the rules. Hey babe. I was thinking we could do tire for lunch. How does that sound? That's cool with me. Whatever you want. What the hell? Babe, where are we gonna eat this tire food at? I'm hungry. Yo, what the hell are you doing on my phone? How do you even unlock it anyway. You know boy, boy I had your passcode a long time ago. Now I answered my question. Why have you got his nasty ass text messages from this hoes? Huh? They're not hoes. They are my female acquaintances. Like I said, hoes. Simone, hat's the issue? Oh, hello. I left Rain so that we can be in a relationship. What the hell is that. You said the R word. Look, Dominique, I'm not playing with you. I left my three year long relationship with Rain. So that I can be with somebody who I thought wanted to be with me for the long haul. I assume that you I are on the road towards getting married. Ooh. You know what they say about those who are selling. And if you finish that statement, I'm gonna slap that beard off of your face. Listen Simone, I never said we were exclusive. I mean, I care about you and I do want to be with you, but I'm not trying to be a lockdown. I mean, besides I'm already sticking my neck out, risking my friendship with my boy to be with you in the first place. Did nobody make you sneak around with my ass? No. But you did continue to throw it at me. Begging me to take it. You are nothing but a low down dirty dog. Wolf, Wolf baby. Now we still going to get that food or what? You know what? Why don't you call up one of your little female acquaintances? 'Cause I'm sure one of them wants to give you their rotten peach. Pock ass. Oh, Mm-hmm. Yeah. Before I forget, just so that we're clear and I mean crystal. This right here. It's done. So I guess I said no all the time. ♪ Don't switch up on me, ♪ More than the earth can see. ♪ You changing your face boy ♪ That person had pleasure to me. ♪ You don't love me the same, ♪ My happiness used to grace my pain. ♪ You changing your face boy, ♪ The only thing I recognize ♪ Is your name ♪ Your secrets could keep back ♪ And fought back What would you wanna eat? Rain, what a surprise? What are you doing here? This is where my introduction to rocket in class. What a coincidence? Not really. I teach here every Thursday. You know that. Semantics. Listen, are you busy? Because I would love to talk to you about something. Well, I.. He actually is. We have somewhere that we need to be. Okay, good. So you're free. Listen, I am so sorry for anything soar that I did between us. I should not have rejected your marriage proposal that way. I was a fool to let a man like you go. You got the fool part, right? Excuse you. You heard what I said? Look, I have invested three years into this relationship. The boy is mine. Well, it's only taken me a couple of weeks, to undo the damage that you have done. Turning this hurt boy into a strong mate. So it all belongs to me. I bet if he proposed to me again, I would say yes to you this time. Well, you're not going to be able to say anything. After I knock your teeth out. Okay ladies, ladies. Now as much as I love a good girlfriend and I do indeed love a good girlfriend. You can't be acting like this in public. Fine. You get a boxing ring. I'll fight that. Okay Simone, stop. all right. Look, I don't know what's changed for you to be acting like this, but none of that shit matters. You broke my heart into a million pieces when you said no. Now, it's taken some time, but I finally got to put back together. And the stakes to this beautiful woman by my side. He's talking about me. Simone, you made your choice, and Elena is mine. But Rain. Come on baby. You okay? Yeah, I'm gonna get the phone. Hello? Oh, hey Scott. Oh no, I'm not doing anything tomorrow. Sure. Yeah, I can come into the station. Oh, okay. Sounds good. Yeah. I'll see you first thing in the morning. Who was that? That was my GM. He wants to talk to me about lifting my suspension and giving me my old job back. That's good right? Rain. I believe in you on my good luck though. Trust me baby. Luck has nothing to do with it. I'm happy for you. Hey. Oh, boy! What? What the hell! How's you'll? Key. Duh. You know what? Not even free to look through my group. Oh,. What's up with you. It's probably dilute. Put Down. You even finish that statement. I just got back from station. Big boy getting his show back. Nice. That was awesome. Congratulations. Thank you. I'm glad to hear that because that dude that they had replaced, you took temporarily, he was starting to make my ears bleed. Right. Now that Danny, what we said the other night, we say we like old boy 'cause he plays a bit of rotation and we want him to stay in. Really? I mean, boom. I'm glad he's gone. He sucks. Anyway. I'm just glad that you got your life back together. Me too. I truly believe that having a lady in my life that's when all the things turned around for me. She has really helped to see the value in myself. Being with Elena, it's like a breath of fresh air. Man, that woman is amazing. I don't see myself spending the rest of my life with her. Oh, damn. Just think about the proposal again. It's not about the proposal to Elena. Not yet. Anyway. Well, I'm happy for you. I say we celebrate. How about a little holiday kickback? Sounds good to me and we and where? Let's do it here, tonight. What? Duh, let's make it happen Yo, you good? Yeah. I'm okay. See you tonight, okay? Good. What's wrong with her? I like this sweater man, where did you get it from? It's nice, Yeah, it's nice. I appreciate. You guys look really good together. Yeah, I've heard a lot of good things about you. Yeah, she is. I don't think so. Like, you know. Girl. I like him yawn. You crazy. . Like what? Yeah. Try it and draw back another. I like your breath. Mm-hmm. Oh. You are sick. Hey, I got it Yeah, 'cause this is indeed your kickback. In due to believe. Oh, right. Cheers to that. Simone? The hell are you doing here? I saw that the whole gang was together. Friends. Aj. Damn, I thought I blocked her. Hello everyone. Simone. What do you want? Well, I saw that everyone was celebrating your new found good fortune face IG. Damn I could have someone, I blocked her. So I thought that I should join in on the festivities. Simone, you need to leave. Why is that my dear Dominique? So that your precious secret isn't exposed. Look Simone, I don't give a damn about any of your secrets, whatever game it is that you're trying to play. You just need to leave. I ain't going nowhere until I say what I got to say. Why can't you just accept the fact that you made the decision to leave me? And because of that, you no longer have a place here. I'm with Elena now and we're happy. Right? Okay. If your girl was so happy, then why is Dominique paying her to be with you? What? You lying. Nope. Elena is this true? I mean it started out that way at first. But once I started to get to know you, I accepted less payments. I mean, I was getting to the point where I could be with you for free. Gosh. Damn. The tea is hot. This is crazy. Yes it is. Oh, and how do I know that bit of information you ask? No one asked. I know because I was with Dominique when he made the call after we had sex. What? Wait. That's right. Your bestie and I have been having sex for months. He's the reason that I said no to you. Damn! Rain, Rain. I don't want to hear anything right now. Just let me explain. Simone. Nothing. Like I said, I ain't going nowhere until I... Bitch. If you want. Relax. Yeah. Relax. I ain't finished playing with his hair yet. Bye you'll. So am I still getting paid or not? You ruining the game. Yo Rain, let me holler at you for a sec. The only thing I want to know is why. Why would you do that to me Dom? It just. Look, man. Simone is one of those things that just happened. Bullshit. Dom you got your slew of women? You've got your pick up all these women you be calling and texting all the time. Why did you have to go sleep with mine. Look man, I know I messed up but I'm trying to make... Or you think... I got caught up, all right? It was only supposed to happen one time. And then it happened a second time and it did happen multiple times. I mean, negative shit was just so good. Well, you noticed that. I'm trying to get your ass kicked. Listen, man. There's nothing I can do or say, explain to you what I did. I stabbed you in your back and I'm sorry about that. You damn ritual. And the whole thing with Elena. Look, man, I feel guilty about what I was doing, man. And it didn't seeing everything that you was going through. I had to do something. So yeah, I paid one of my colleagues to go out with you. I mean, Elisa bought you out of your phone when things looking out for you. Except for the fact that my whole relationship with Elena was a lie. And my best friend slept with the woman that I was planning on spending the rest of my life with. Right, that's all over with. I mean the truth is out Rain. I'm not kicking it with Simone anymore. I broke things off. I chose you, our friendship over her. And so now things are just supposed to go back to how they were before, huh? Exactly. I mean, come on man.
