Regarding gays, we need a legal initiative. There is no other way. Good! I think I'll force my homosexual patients - unfortunately, I have far too many in my practice - I don't know, I seem to attract them somehow - I think I should force them to take a blood test. My personnel refuse to work with them anymore. I'm Rudiger Kakinski, sauna owner. I earn plenty on the gays who spend long nights of pleasure in my sex club. My lover is Christian. He studies church music. He loves me very much, but I must always remind him that I can't love just one. Sex means to me freedom with many. I believe cancer feeds more people than it kills. Why should Aids be different? Exactly. I want to introduce a new preparation, De-deficiency 006. Now, we need Aids patients to test our medicament. Prof. Dr. Blood, virologist and plague expert, called in on hot point Aids. She is scientifically overtaxed by gay sex problems. Aids is an open market. There's money on tap. Our research trip to Africa has been funded. Carola Shurksh, reporter for the tabloid "Purple Pages." Pursuing her vocation with passion and perseverance, she is ruthless with others as well as with herself. Have you heard the latest? What's the capital of Aids? Darmstadt (="Intestine City") We at least won't surrender the liberation of our bodies. Did we defend our rock-hard position to turn soft now? Or our freedom found in the many self-discovery groups high in the Swiss mountains in tiny one man tents with 30 love-hungry comrades. We all screwed like mad, and all psychic armor burst to smithereens. Here you see Ms. Tomalik-Samenkorn, psychotherapist. She believes Aids, her specialty, is psychosomatic. She loves sex. There, her specialty is bisexual men. Her favorite sex partner is Karl Kolle, a revolutionary of the old school. He works radically to force Aids victims and the state to confront the disease. As a male nurse, he has many chances to pursue his goal. No offense intended. I've prepared a little film which we should all see. We've attempted to present the disease simply for our little patients. Each human is a miracle, and also our sicknesses are full of secrets. We're the body's police, quick little killer cells. We fight and arrest our foes. We're the clever Aids virus. We sneak into your body. We have little bombs to blow up the police. We welcome our friends, viruses, bacteria and cancer. We make you ill, blind, dumb and stupid. An ugly death. This is an action of the ASI! The Army of the Sick and Impotent. Down with the reactionary medical asses. We demand humane treatment and psychological care for Aids victims. The Aids revolt will destroy the fascist medical regime. "A Virus Knows no Morals" A film from Rosa von Praunheim with: Camera by Elfi Mikesch You are not of flesh, but of spirit - Hello, my dear. - Blessings. Today we have a bestial soup. Sharkfin soup, turtle soup, jellied eel, maybe chocolate pudding. How was university today? We had a theological lecture about Father Ignatius and the stigmata of Teresa. Someone shit in the sauna, a guy slipped in it, and the insurance won't pay! Next week is a seminar about purgatory. Then a load of poppers broke. What a stink! Hey, it's so wasteful, all these expensive things. Can't we live more plainly? I need three more volumes of Theology and the Church. Who makes the money here? - Shit! Now I can throw out the soup. - Let me suck it. It's blood you spilt for me. If you love me, stay away! You act like you have Aids. Yes. I'm positive. I didn't want to tell you. That's why you haven't slept with me for so long. Is that the only reason? That would make me so happy. You can't bind our marriage with Aids as others do with a child. You know I'll care for you until you die. I can't take your pitiful theological crap. Aids is our chance! Don't you see that? I want a child from a gay before they die out. What do you mean, "Die out"?! The Aids victims are the proletariat of tomorrow. The world revolution of bodies and viruses will spell the definitive doom of capitalism. Where Aids is, must I be. Try to understand that. Our bombs will blow only with the explosion of liberated consciousness. Our most potent weapon is the time-bomb Aids! What are you doing? You can be on the cover of "Purple Pages" as Aids mother with child. My son isn't gay! How many times has he had pneumonia already? Has the virus attacked the brain yet? And you! Tell me, is your husband bisexual, or are you a drug addict? How much do you want? 10,000... 20,000? Use your last chance! It's so dirty here. Can't you clean up a little? I'm always cleaning up. I can't clean it as fast as they make it dirty. Your making Mondays "Buddies' Day" was a stroke of genius. They're queuing up, and fucking their dicks off. I can't manage alone anymore. And Thomas and Gerhardt? They must be well by now. They've been sick 14 days. I'm throwing them out. The flu doesn't last so long. They're too expensive. Maybe it's more serious. Let's not get crazy. Just 10% of the infected supposedly die. It's all alarmism! They called from the health magazine "Practice". They want to interview you. No reporters, no interviews, and this shit poster from the idiotic Aids Help doesn't belong in my sauna. I've nothing to do with Safer Sex. But you wanted to put in that condom dispenser. The customers would laugh themselves silly. Besides, those things always tear. What's safe about that? Even the soap dispenser is always broken. I've ordered the fact-sheet on a new anal douche. They say it wards off Aids. It's not as if we're doing nothing! We won't let them take away the freedom we fought so hard for ten years to achieve. But in America it's getting dramatic. Saunas are closing. Say, where are the new porno films from America? They sent Safer Sex pornos. Shall we keep them or send them back? Not without a rubber. What do you mean, rubber? I won't do it without a rubber. - How boring. - For our safety. That's not for me. Come on. No! You stupid asshole. You're crazy. That turns me right off. Then kiss my ass. The army of Aids victims shall lead the hungry, oppressed, infected masses of Earth to victory. First they must get rid of their many internal mommies and daddies who with gaping Aids-infected muzzles thrash their superegos like machine gun fire... Aids is a slobbering, clawing mother beast nesting in the walls of their souls. Is that you, Mom? Just think! Tomorrow I'll be in Bonn. No, not for a couple days. For a few months! One of your sudden escape attempts from Berlin, from the swamp which I struggle to hide from the people here in Bonn. Now this surprise attack! I'm sick of the night life here in Berlin. I'm fed up with the action here. I'd like to really relax and let you spoil me a bit. Out of the question. I sat for years at your father's sickbed till he died. Your childhood diseases practically drove me crazy. Two years ago, I lay in the hospital with cancer, while my dear son in Berlin lived out his orgiastic proclivity to his own sex. Fooey! Unpack your bags. Mom, listen. I have to tell you something. I'm sick. I have Aids. What's that? You can't mean this incurable gay disease? Rudiger, what in the world do you have in mind? I'm a working woman. At the ministry here I have to consider my reputation. I mustn't make a fool of myself on my new surfboard. Another invalid at home? Forget it. Mother, I need you now. I can't go on. You have to help me. Don't be so melodramatic. Who comforted me in hospital? Who drove me to the radiation treatments? Who massaged my amputated breast? Not you, Rudy, not you. Can't you at least come to Berlin? Oh, I'll see what I can do toward the end of the month. Adios, my son. "Mother, I Thank You" "Can I Get Aids from People" "Who Emit Spittle While Speaking?" Virus-proof winter fashion. Kiss-shielded cross-stitch knitted caps. Rip- and bite-proof fashions for young girls. Thank you. Aids-free Flirting Made Easy How I Raise My Son as a Real He-Man Heterosexual by Springtime Lust-infected vegetation, Alpine violets... No, not gay Alpine violets. Gay florists! You always wake me when I'm deep asleep. Where were you? I've waited for you so long. I had such bad dreams. They fumigated the whole house. Lie down with me a little. You can't stand me when I'm sick! That's how it's always been. Did you at least bring the Marilyn Monroe tape? And where's the second TV? Of course. You did nothing. Please blow me. I'll put on three rubbers. Or stick something sweet in my mouth. Shitty red apples! I don't want apples. I want chocolate biscuits. Or a soup. OK, I'll quickly heat a can. A can? Quickly? Heat? You're so cold. I may as well have hired an Eskimo. Dieter's so nice to me. I do everything for you, I even gave up my studies. You see? Failure! But I only care for you. You're so full of lies. Your study is one big lie. See how dirty this pig is? Please disinfect this filthy pig! I can't let these germ infestations near me. You know how dangerous it is. I'm already sick, I sens your strangling grip. You want to kill me, you want to nurse me to death! I'm so afraid. Please. I'm dying. Please don't leave me alone! Go back! You'll not save your friend, so save your own life. He's dying. For hours he awaited you with hope in his soul. The tyrant's scorn failed to rob him of his brave belief. Now it's too late. If I can't welcome him as savior, then death should unite us. The bloody tyrant is denied the glory of duty broken by friend to friend. He slaughtered two victims, and faith in loyalty and love. "Aids to Ashes" Festive cremation of the last practicing homosexual. Strupel Crematorium declared historic structure. But not till autumn, '88. Sex is there for everyone: Che, Mao, Haeberle! You take the words right out of my clitoris. Aids is no subject for us. What nonsense! That someone can pin the virus on anyone else. Absurd! It's all psychosomatic. Who doesn't want it doesn't get it. Aids, like life, is a constant up and down, with many peaks and crises. Bouts of night-sweat and fever, diarrhea and mouth fungus - then again I feel great. When life gets hard, I know how to persevere. I'm a self-aware gay. I regret nothing. Ms. Thomalik-Samenkorn, I feel pleased as punch and right as rain and full of vim and vigor! I've begun to model a group of copulating men in clay, and I want to go to Africa. All the hours with you... ...have helped me so much that I'm totally well. I don't need you anymore. You're not serious, Mr. Kakinski. You're repressing again. Today we must confront your death. It's vital. Your death wish. Please assume a precramp attitude. I've brought you a few death objects. There's no sense in suppressing thoughts of death. In our society death is taboo. Today I'm giving you the chance to die in 60 minutes. Together with me. I'll escort you in dying. Look at this little coffin. You must become so tiny that you'll fit in this itty bitty coffin. Death is an agile fellow. You have to fit in there. If we achieve that today, I'll be satisfied with you. Now fold yourself. Assume the amoebic position. More. More! Make yourself tight. Tighter. We're almost there. You'll evaporate like a snowflake, like an ash. You're a nothing. Your eyes are glassy, your nostrils expand, your mouth stretches open in death cramp. And you become stiff. Get large for death. Get tense for death. Stretch for death, reach out for death! Now we must learn the acceptance of pain, feeling the beauty of pain throughout the body. Concentrate, and repeat after me: My right leg causes pain. My left leg causes agony. My right arm is full of ulcers. My left arm is dead. My whole body is covered with open sores. See the sores. Violet, brown and putrid. Your whole body is one open sore. My scrotum is bursting. My scrotum explodes! Say it! See the virus? 87 varieties. All very colorful, they buzz and zoom in chaos all over your body. Look at them! Now you see the clysters of the Last Judgment. You see the fires of Hell. Are you afraid of the Son of God? Transfer your fears to me. After all, that's what I'm here for. I always wanted to die. At 20 I celebrated my funeral, then I always painted hanging men. Couldn't we die together? I can't kill myself. We only overcome our fear through faith in a higher Being. You really believe that religious crap? That we'll be flying about somewhere as little lights in white shirts? You believe that? Don't be so ironic. Do you think we'll meet again after death? We all die. We'll die in a nuclear war. You'll just die a bit sooner. The meaning of human life is to die. But not at 40. That's not for us to say. But you should have an emergency baptism. Then I could hear your confession. You surely want to sit with the just on Judgment Day. They sing of sweet things that move the human breast. They sing the things of glory that uplift the human heart. The courtiers forget their jests. The king's courageous warriors bow down before their God. The queen, dissolving in melancholy lust, tosses to the singers the rose from her breast. "You've bewitched my people:" "Do you now seduce my dame?" The king roars in fury, his body trembling with rage. He hurls his sword which flashing, pierces the young man's breast; and instead of golden ballads, blood fountains from his chest. B 6587/594 III C 9,824 HTLV III Positive. Positive? Why do you look at me like that? There's no way to change it now. You'll just have to cope. Listen, I won't come at you with morality - that's not my field - but with prudence. Why do homosexual men - pardon the term - fuck in the face of this disease? Don't talk to me about drives. Humans are not objects of blind drives. That's how we differ from animals, that we can control our urges. My goodness, what can I do? Do? We can do absolutely nothing. We just wait for the disease to break out. Would you like to take a little test? Come. Push the button next to your preferred sex practice. That would shame me. You and shame? "anal sex (active) anal sex (passive)" That bitch Blood, the asshole. Typical. She'd be glad if every gay man and junkie kicked off. Always doing shitty experiments on them. But we won't make it easy for her. A positive test result is not a death sentence. Now you have to live healthy. Sleep a lot, eat cottage cheese, oatmeal, fresh salad. Why not join the gay sport club, "Healthy with Aids"? That would strengthen your immune system. We have to get active, be strong, self-aware and ready to fight. What can you do in our common struggle against Aids? I'm in a church choir. I could sing to the patients. Great! Then you choir members could smuggle weapons into the hospital under your robes! Sing something for me. As fountains flow, so must we drink. If I may not call my love, I'll wave to him. I barely stood the business with the guinea pig. The one that a homo shaved bald with a lawnmower. Then he pulled out its claws, poked out its eyes, and shoved the animal into his rectum. The poor, abused creature! We should treat Aids as VD. Sex still sells the best. I have exposés: Intimate Confessions, Men like Confetti Mass Masturbation Bloodbath in the Homo Bars Masochism in Mattress Factory Sex Spree, Blood Splurge, Death in Excrement Suffocation in Ejaculation Sex Blood Sex Death Three new saunas have opened. We have to come up with something. We could throw another Drag Ball. Great! Me as Prince Valiant and you as Guinevere. You'd like that. If, then only as Josephine Baker. Then I could squeeze your banana. The way you've been screwing around lately, I wouldn't let you near me. You and your stupid Aids. You can only get it from being fucked, and I always do the fucking. And you know I like to get fucked. Let's forget it. I'm feeling low today. The new job in the sauna is stressier than I expected, and my love life is a washout. I think I'll never have sex again. But sweety, don't say such a horrible thing. Sometimes I wish I were gay. Your sex lives are so mysterious and exciting. But maybe you should really try it with women. I know someone who'd make you a perfect match. Could you give me 50 marks? I have to powder my nose. I don't have so much money. - Surely you could... - Always the same. What shall I do? She's putting the make on me. She wants to get me in bed. What shall I do? Yes, I like her, but I'm afraid of Aids. You have Aids in the ears. You have Aids in the newspapers. You have Aids on TV. - This woman doesn't have Aids. - You think so? She's just horny. You know, dear, a hot, melting woman can be wonderful. The resilient, pulsing vulva, the erect little clitoris, and everything so moist and hot. Excuse me, cuddles, but take your breasts away from my head. I have to tell you the bitter truth. Cunts are utterly strange to me. For the beginning, so you don't have readjustment problems, close your eyes and imagine my breasts are a huge shaved scrotum, and my pubic hair a mustache that's been in the rain - all upside down. But you know I don't like mustaches. Gays make the best lovers. Women and gays together could develop a thrilling new sexuality. Tell me, treasure, where exactly is this clitoris? He who seeks shall find! Christian! What are you doing? What are you doing to your mother? What did I do wrong? I can't take this. What's wrong with you? You could get any girl. Where did I fail? That you love men! You have your fate in your hands... In the evening when desire overwhelms you In the evening when desire overwhelms you You have your fate in your hands You have your fate in your hands... When the catastrophic situation becomes known When the catastrophic situation becomes known You have your fate in your hands We have your fate in our hands We have your fate in our hands... Hello, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Dr. Blood from the Institute for Plague Pestilence and Death. In reference to our lecture series "Aids": "Does Humanity Stand a Chance?" I dedicate today's discussion to the theme, "Avoiding Infection." The Aids virus is found in the following body fluids: blood, urine, semen, and saliva. Infection with Aids results only through direct exchange of body fluids, be it blood with urine, urine with semen, semen with saliva, saliva with blood, blood with urine and so on. Such exchange occurs as a rule only during sexual intercourse. Masturbation is once again chic and modern. No one has to get Aids. Safer Sex is the motto. Please secure yourself with an individualized condom: colored or flashy, structured or smooth, flavored or tasteless, or dynamic. I've prepared a little demonstration for you. See for yourself. With... and without condom. I'd like to give you a little personal advice: Our best defense is natural shame. You have your fate in your hands. Mother! What are you doing here? You always were a bit eccentric, but I didn't realize that you're so perverse. I'm not here just for fun. I'm simply doing my duty. Someone has to sacrifice so the taxpayers can be told the ugly truth of what this homo pack is up to. I'll expose this filth in my series in "Purple Pages' with photos and all details! Then sympathy for these plague carriers will die. You shut up! So you're one of these poison-spreading mercenaries who use the rotten tabloids to rile the people, to deceive and lie to them. My mother - a greasy fink. I can't believe it. You dare to insult me? Your own flesh and blood? You don't mean to stand up for these degenerates! Boy, you're here to let water at nature's call, I hope. Or can it be that you're one of these piss swine? Do you realize the damage your articles cause? Your tirades drive hundreds of unhappy queens to ruin! Urine you mean! In your own urine you should all drown! My mother is dead to me. You'll end in the gutter. Piss off! Feel how your immune system is stronger? Yes, but it made me still stronger to sing for all those poor Aids patients. Their suffering was my song, and gave me strength for the highest notes. Those deeply moved faces - You radiate peace. You remind me of the little prince watching the sunset 40 times in a row. I worked long to achieve that. We must reach our inner strength. With you I feel very strong. Let's not spoil the intensity of this moment with such profane things. Only through celibacy can the Spirit enter our hearts. Our relationship can reach deeper levels without sex. Abélard said it 700 years ago: "Should a limb vex you, cut it off and fling it away." What rubbish. You can't go to the butcher and get everything cut off! You're so radical otherwise. And what's with Safer Sex? You don't understand me. My friend's sickness has taught me to despise flesh. And when desire grabs you? Meditation. Discipline. Cold showers. Woolen underwear. Let's repeat 50 times: When the heart is unstained The cock never strains Only free sexuality gives the Aids revolution a chance. Your revolution leaves me cold. You'll see what comes of it. The hippies became junkies, the student movement brought terrorism, and the gay movement, Aids. Now that we're here, I want to be truthful. My whole life I've hated men. I've tried to hide it from you. Your father's sex organ sickened me just to see it. That's why I only let him use it in total darkness, then only if the household money was running low. I hated them all: your teachers, your doctors, Dad's drinking buddies, his bosses, the barber, tailor, shoemaker! But Mom, why didn't you ever tell me? Now I know you never loved me. We're together now. I'll make it good. I love you. I just never knew it before. We're both ill. You have Aids, I have cancer. If we don't get together now, Rudiger! Don't you remember our breakfast times? Our evenings when I came to your little bed? And you recited the lovely ballads. - "The Erl King!" Please, Mom, say it again. - Goethe! Where the hell is this therapist? 150 marks an hour! "You're you, I'm I. I do my thing, you do your thing." Please, "The Erl King", for me. The father is horrified He rides swift arid wild He holds in his arms The groaning child He toils to the manor In extremity of dread In his embrace His child lies dead We're not at the amateur Shakespeare festival. What are you doing, Ms. Wohlenbreast? You should have been turning yourself into an Aids virus for your son to kick, pulp and trample into the carpet. Rudiger, you've practiced on 397 rubber dolls. I tell you, the health insurance won't pay for any more. Concentrate on the original. In the transference of cathartic treatment transpires the perfect matricide, the murder of the murderous virus. Now please: Aids beast yields before us When the mother is a carcass Where Aids is, must I be. OK, go to it. What is it? Why do you still hesitate? Get going, get going. Aids beast yields before us When the mother is a carcass Aids brute, our fear has ceased We know you as the mother beast What on earth are you doing? Then I'll show you again with our power images, although I find it silly. This is you, Rudiger. You're like this. So strong. Tarzan, avenger of the Aids victims. This is your mother, the fat disgusting alligator. And what does our strong Tarzan do with the fat disgusting alligator? He drowns, conquers, destroys it! Watch carefully. Now proceed to do the same with your mother. Aids beast yields before us When the mother is a carcass Aids brute, our fear has ceased We know you as the mother beast Why don't you begin? I can't strangle my mommy. I love my mommy so much. If that's how it is, I'll see you tomorrow in the Pool of Sour Mother Milk. It'll be tough. Submarine birth, birth trauma, Caesarian section, maybe a delivery. I don't care. Good day. The virologist, Professor Doctor Blood, and I have undertaken the difficult trip to Central Africa to study the origin of the disease Aids. I'm interred in studying the natives' sex problems. One hears thrilling things about these savages. There are even whispers of cannibalism. At any rate, the natives supposedly ingest the long-tailed monkey, and thereby infect themselves. For days through pathless jungle, my assistant, Dr. Habelsword and I have been on the trail of the mysterious ape which supposedly carries the Aids virus and transmits it to humans. Professor, take a careful look around. I believe someone is fucking you from behind. How strong is a person? How much fear, how much pressure can one bear? Is he ever as strong as he believes? Who can say? Hurrah, we're still alive! What haven't we had to go through? We're still alive All we've endured so patiently The bruise on our soul is healing We're still alive After every Elsa comes a Ruth We're still alive Is it enough to give us new confidence and courage? It's not to be taken for granted, but We're still alive Darlings, that was our little show package flown in fresh from the country, the Bermudaas with "Hurrah, We're Still Alive." Zarah couldn't, and Greta is still under grave arrest. And now on to our little contact contest. Now everybody blows - not what you think, you little piglets - for the booby prize... Well, then, maybe not. This will be an evening of sensations, of superlatives which your loins won't soon forget. Juice will shoot in the body and brain until you all get ravenous and wild as beasts of prey. The Red Death had long ravaged the land. No other pestilence had been so ruinous, so calamitous, so loathsome. Still the Prince Prospero remained gay and heedless. His plan was shrewd. When his lands were half depopulated, he summoned 1000 healthy, merry friends from among the knights and ladies of his court. With them he retired to deep seclusion in one of his isolated fortresses. The prince had provided for every kind of amusement. Jesters were there, actors, ballet dancers and musicians. Beauty was there, and wine, arabesque fashions, sheer and whimsical to extremes. Fantastic exhibitions took place, some with the earmarks of madness. All this and safety were here inside. Outside was and remained the Red Death. Now, however, must the clock strike twelve. And if a guest or two paled to see a masked stranger, the majority were lost in hysterical dancing, whirling in sheer glory of life with shrieks of joy. These saw the danger too late for flight or rescue. The mummer had gone so far as to take the form of Death. His robe was sprinkled with blood, his figure gaunt and tall, and the mask resembled the rigid countenance of a corpse. Now the presence of the Red Death became known. And Darkness, and Decay, and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all. Nobody move! Rotten exploiter of gays. Getting rich while the people here get Aids. Your filthy shop is a kind of extermination camp! You party while others perish. But we'll teach you ignorant queens to do your bit for the great Aids movement. Move, you birds. I want all your jewelry in here. Quick! Move it! Aids Power is your last chance, too. My jewels! We didn't mean it. The family heirlooms! I can't get over that Rock Hudson was gay. I was such a fan. If something doesn't break on this graveyard shift, I'm going to die of boredom. If the Lord doesn't take at least three in the night, I'm underworked. You're both disgusting. In the infant section things were far more sympathetic. You old virgin, you don't spread your legs anyway. At least you won't get Aids. Our Lord Jesus was conceived without intercourse. I have 3 children from 5 men, all former patients. Those were the days when we could really fuck our way through the stations. Now it's all over. These days even the doctors have Aids. - It's enough to turn a person lesbian. - Sister Lolita! Oh Lord, forgive the spiritually poor. Much time has passed, and many friends have died. Also Dieter, my assistant in the sauna, became ill. One day he woke up with high fever, then one bout of pneumonia after another wracked his weak body till its last resistance fled. He was the one who had little sex, who waited for the one great love that never appeared. Maybe only the weak die from it, and the strong live on. I want to live. I'll beat the disease. Tomorrow they'll find a cure. The disease still makes me horny. I fuck now only with positives. The doctors try to forbid us that, too, claiming we always risk new infection. But sex is life, and I believe in life. Christina, I'm so sick. I have such pain. I'll kill myself. Bring me an iron for the bathtub, or take me to the roof in a wheelchair, and tip me over, or bring me a set of sharp kitchen knives. Pull yourself together. I'm at the end of my strength. What are you doing? Your diary is of high interest to us. How much do you want for it? 10,000... 20,000? We want to bring you out big in "Purple Pages". Tell us about your sex partners, sex practices. Be exact. Please, no hollow shame. Have you made your will? Who's the lucky heir? Use your last chance! We have a device against Aids. The Aidsolator. Automatic virus extractor attachable at all body orifices, here combined with a fruit-juicer which supplies sterilized Vita-protein in recycling technique. See for yourself. I have more models to show you... Oh woe of suffering Must it then be? Oh woe is me Who would not feel pity? Oh woe of pain I feel in my heart Must I then relinquish you? Must I then relinquish you? It's thus God requires my life... I can't stand it! The pus, the stink these horrible ulcers brown sheets, soggy mattresses, bloody pillows! I'm so young! I want to see so much more! Everywhere death, and the fear of getting infected. It's making me sick! Enough of that number, OK, kid? The Lord has given us a heavy test. Don't complain, dear sister. Our reward shall come in Heaven. When I die, I, as Mother Euthanasia, holy to Aids victims, shall be sainted, and at my grave miracles will occur. I don't believe in sex after death. Let's roll the dice. Who'll kick the bucket first. The jigaboo on 2, the needle freak on 4, or the fat assfucker on 6. I bet a bottle of champagne. Well, OK. Before I fade out completely. The die is cast. Mr. Lulu Patabooboo will step first before his Lord with a hearty "hallalooloo hulalala". 87 viruses, all colors and so deadly. One virus, one mark. Two viruses, one mark fifty. And here, the Aids therapy for the common man. Don't miss it. 87 viruses, colorful and sugar sweet. And a little deadly. I'm already infected. I infect you free of charge. Dear lady, your household mustn't be without it. Come sweetheart. All the poor Aids patients are waiting for you. You swine! I got it from you! You warn to wipe out women! From our series "Stories for a Good Night", the first part of our little utopia: "Aids '87." 12 Aug '87: Medical estimates put the number of Aids - infected in the Fed. Rep. of Germany at over 200,000. 17 Aug '87: The Aids Test Requirement is now law. Food handlers, flight personnel, teachers, hairdressers, cosmeticians, etc. are required by law to take the Aids antibody test. Positive results lead to immediate dismissal. 16 Sept '87: Panic in the German army. 10% infected. 17 Sept '87: Aids patients rebel. An Aids victim is flung from 4th floor hospital window. Many Aids patients badly beaten. You were bitten by a wild ape. How do you know? I'm a virus and want to fly. I want to infect the sky. I want to infect the clouds. I want to infect the loving God! 5 Oct '87:70% of all prisoners infected. Bloody unrest among inmates in Frankfurt. The integration of Aids-infected and non-infected causes wave of terror. Guards killed. Many escape. 10 Oct '87, Stuttgart: Hoodlum gangs attack gays. Gay-beating is becoming a sport. 21 Dec '87: Aids epidemic now pandemic. European Congress calls state of emergency. Russian and Eastern hospitals rumored swamped by Aids. 11 Jan '88: Father Terry Mouthful demands the immediate incarceration of all homosexuals. Churches closed. Many Catholic priests infected. Pope enters quarantine. 15 Jan '88: Theater scene closed. There are no lights on Broadway. Many in the theaters of NY and Berlin are dead of Aids. Herr Minister, in the face of panicky, hysterical public reaction to Aids patients, we of the Institute of Comparative Vandalism, to protect all affected parties, propose the following concept: All Aids patients will be brought to ideal isolation on the island Helgoland. We'll attempt to make what time remains to them as enjoyable as possible in Blocks A, B and C. Kindergarten, island TV, a treatment pavilion in the form of a public WC, and a condom factory - all within this post-modern viral disinfection park - surely that's a fair offer. Food supply is maintained via air-bridge through parachute drop of Care packages onto Dune 13. Fine and good, but how will you break the resistance of the ex-Helgolanders, the butter voyage lobby, and the Committee for the Protection of Laughing Gulls? No problem. The headlong rush to Helgoland has taken a nose dive. In principle everything's clear, Herr Minister. One tiny problem remains: Who's going to finance the highly visible, gloriously illuminated barbed wire installation surrounding the project? Especially attractive are our newly developed nursing robots type Sylvia 3 with 14 integrated nursing programs and additional fun button. We thought as well for the realm of leisure on the free-time robot Play Rob from the firm Rent a Friend. Both models come in the variations male and female, and in the taste types Dominant, Thai and Evangelical. Then I could offer the public the motto: "More joy in life in less time." Why, every month we could have a carnival! We plan to make a Boer island into a visitor platform. There, from a safe distance, one could experience live the prickling fascination of a modern de-infection camp. And from there, relatives may maintain personal telephone-video contact. The ships embark daily except Mondays from Hamburg. With admission fees we hope to finance the action, Gypsies to the North Sea. Ladies and gentlemen, you are shipping to Helgoland. As a farewell gesture from my administration, we've prepared for you a cold buffet on the poop deck, where trim, charming sailors will attend to your needs. Winds blow, ships go, so I wish you for your journey to the other side - for your last great voyage - fresh air and a stiff breeze. Cast off, or as we sea people say: Ahoy! We lay off Madagaskar And had the Pest on board In the casks the water grew foul And one man per day went overboard Ahoy, comrades, ahoy Farewell, little darling Farewell When that ship-board piano sounds The sailors stay so still Each is longing for his homeland Which he hopes to see once again Herr Minister, you are a prisoner of the ASI! The wind has changed! The signs point to storm! We demand 1 billion cash in the hand for research and education. I demand 7,000 convicts for medical experimentation. And I, Mother-Son Aids Shelters at all swimming pools. Sweety, how shall I infect you? You want a French kiss? Or should I rather give you a blow job? My good woman, I'll tell you something to leave you quite spitless. Do you think all 456 parliamentary representatives are negative? The problem has spread to the ruling body. We've even discussed declaring next year "The Year of Aids Victims" And financial demands. You can name the sum. We'll have to take it away from the niggers, but I always say, the nigger at home counts more. Hence, the administration hereby agrees to meet your demands as long as the duress of contingency fails to interfere. Now, could I please have back my hat? Now a summary of last week's dramatic events. Monday, 3:00 PM: Six members of the terror organization ASI were killed in attempting to escape from police. Tuesday, 7:00 PM: Solidarity rallies for the ASI in Frankfurt and Berlin. Two policemen killed in a gun battle with homos. Wednesday: Three Ministers slain by the ASI. All were members of conservative parties and stood for the legalization of euthanasia. - Thursday: Administration declares war on the ASI. Special troops round up all know Aids virus carriers. Saturday: The President appeals to the ASI. "I have reliable information that a remedy exists." "A preventative vaccination will be required by law." "Still, the serum is no help to those already infected," "and can't cure Aids." - Sunday night: Hostilities cease. Both sides agree to a truce. The virus thrives. That's enough. I can't see this Aids shit anymore. I'll turn off the box. What shall we do tonight? Park? Toilet? Or shall we fuck at home? My son has parodontosis! What shall I do? Don't blow, nibble or suck, no draughts, keep a stiff upper lip, and good luck with your new hairdryer. Everyone throughout the land has his fate in his hand You, too, have your fate in your hand.
