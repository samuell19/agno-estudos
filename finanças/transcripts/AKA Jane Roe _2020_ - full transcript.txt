In fact, they didn't even want to talk to me. - One of the things I think that happened sometimes with Norma is that the story she ended up telling herself was of her as the victim, because she felt a lot of sadness.

No, I wasn't. - You were not? - No, I wasn't. - Oh. So all those stories are not true? - Yes, sir, yes. - They are not true? - Right. - It just shocked me, and I just thought, "Oh, no." Roe versus Wade had nothing to do with whether she was raped.

[dramatic music] - World News Sunday. - Good evening. Not since the height of the Vietnam War have so many people marched in Washington as did today in the name of legalized abortion. - They came from all over because of their concern that the Supreme Court may reverse the right to a legal abortion. Leading the protest was a large contingent of celebrities. - And I'm here to say to the Supreme Court, I will make it my job to make sure that we have safe, clean abortion. [cheers and applause] - I met Norma McCorvey at the huge pro-choice rally in Washington, D.C. It was a chance meeting. She told me who she was, and I asked her if she was speaking at the rally, and she said she had not been invited to speak. She was very upset. She felt that she was an activist and wanted to be an activist in support of the right to choose abortion. - I would like to introduce some of the very special people who are here today and whose presence has a very important significance. First, Cybil Shepherd. [cheers and applause] - Thank you for coming. - The pro-choice people, they never gave me an opportunity. You know, they just, "Well, no, she can't speak." What? - She was not the poster girl that... would have been helpful to the pro-choice movement. However, an articulate, educated person could not have been the plaintiff in Roe versus Wade. - The battle is not over today. - I'm a very uneducated person. I'm not a demure, quiet, picture-perfect, white-gloved lady. - Abortion must be legal, safe, accessible. - After the rape thing, they didn't feel like she would help protect Roe versus Wade. Even if she wanted to do that, they were scared. - She felt that she had been denied the opportunity to be recognized and be acknowledged. - Which really set me on fire. "I'll do it now just to show you I can do it." - And I'd like to introduce Norma McCorvey, also known as Jane Roe, the plaintiff in the very famous Roe versus Wade Supreme Court decision. - It's been hard enough for me to come out as Jane Roe and to step into the limelight, so to speak. [light piano music] - She's here today coming out of hiding for this, and we appreciate her courage. Don't we? - Whoo! - We did tons of media. [camera shutters clicking] Gloria and I just fell in like with each other. - Well, that's the way it was back in 1969, especially in Texas. - When you say, "That's the way it was," what are you referring to? - Well, lying to get... try to get... to try to get an abortion. - Excuse me, I don't think that she has capitalized on this at all. To the contrary, it has cost her physically, emotionally, financially. - I don't charge very much. - I clean houses, condos, apartments. Why, does anybody here need a good housecleaning lady? [upbeat piano music] She flew Connie and I out to Southern California. - May I wish you the very best? - Thank you very much. - Really. - You're kind of like a hick out of Hickville. Mmm, that's good. We did something, like, 54 or 56 interviews in a week. [together] Right to life! - Some of them may never come... [together] You don't care if women die. - Then we went to fight Operation Rescue. - Freedom is... all: Pro-choice! - Freedom is... all: Pro-choice! - They were chanting about, "Jane Roe, total lie, that's why all the babies die," or something like that; I'm going, like, "Oh, please, I could think of something better than that, you know, in my sleep." all: Pro-choice! Pro-choice! Pro-choice! Pro-choice! Pro-choice! - For us, Jane Roe was like Adolf Hitler or a Goebbels would be with the Holocaust. She was the face of this evil that was brought on our country by the Roe v. Wade decision. - It's ludicrous. They are sending women back to the back streets. Abortion will continue whether it is legal or not. Women will die from this. Jane Roe is every woman who's ever been denied anything in her whole life, because we've all been denied something at some point, so we're all Jane Roes. - She was the star on the pro-abortion side, and her presence couldn't possibly be ignored. - The nominees are Holly Hunter for "Roe versus Wade." - We warned you that this might happen way back when we first met you. - You let me think that, and you let me hope, and now I gotta have this baby, and I can't even find a job? [applause] - And the Emmy goes to... Holly Hunter. [applause] - I would really like to thank the real-life Jane Roe, Norma McCorvey, for continuing to fight. [applause] - Thou shalt not kill! Read the Ten Commandments. Pick up a Bible. - Back in Dallas, I was still working in an abortion clinic. - [shouting indistinctly] - Behind me here is an abortion mill, where little baby boys and girls die, and outside of the abortion mill are Christian moms and dads, grandmas and grandpas living out their faith in the streets. - The pro-lifers were out on the sidewalk every weekend. - Baby killer! - They used to block the doors, holler at the women, "Don't go in there and kill your baby!" And I'd say, "Oh, shit, shut up." I had a job to counsel women to make sure that they were making the right decisions for themselves. - Would you ladies please consider the child you're carrying? - And I've told I don't know how many young women, "As long as you think you're doing right, then you're doing right." How would they feel if we went to their churches and said, "No, you can't go in there?" - Jane Roe was the poster child for abortion. She was their prize, and there was talk that... that that had to be dealt with. [twangy guitar music] - One Thursday morning Connie called me from work, 'cause we worked at the same clinic. - I called her, and I told her, I said, "You'll never believe who's moving next door," and she said, "Who?" I said, "You're not gonna... in a million years, you'd never guess." "Well, tell me." "Operation Rescue." - Norma McCorvey has an unwelcome new neighbor, Operation Rescue and its national director, Flip Benham. - We've come to live right next to this place and give mothers an informed choice. God just worked a miracle so that we could move right next door to her office, Choice for Women. - They told me it was just an accident. I'm going like... "Listen, Flip, don't try to con an old con." - She was just spitting and fuming and calling me every f-word that she could, because the f-word was one of her favorites, and that...and I was that. - I told them they were damn liars and that they better check with their God to make sure that they were still gonna go to heaven. - She would call up and put crazy things, like, on our recordo-phone, saying, "Hey, we're ha...listen, "we're having barbecued babies today. "Would you like some, Flip? "Would you like to come over and have some barbecued babies with us today?" And I'm going... - One day I was sitting on a bench having a cigarette. He come over there, and he says, "Can I have a seat here?" And I said, "Well," I said, "There's been abortion ass sitting over here." I said, "If you can sit on abortion ass," I said, "Go for it." - He got to talking to her and being nice to her and being phony, like he can be when he's talking to somebody he wants to get over. - I can remember the day, and her little truck was parked right over here. I imagine she's still got that red, ugly truck. And I said, "Ms. Norma, Ms. Norma, what are we gonna do?" And she said, "Well, I don't know," and that was the first time she actually communicated with me, and I said, "Would you come here with me for a minute? I have something I want to tell you," and there was a bench right here, and she and I sat down. She sat on this side, and I sat here. - That's when he gave me his testimony, and he was a badass, a sinner just like everyone else, womanizer. You know, he did it all. It's kind of like my life. - When I saw this lady who was totally lost in her own mess, I saw me. I knew...I knew... I knew what she needed. - Then he... he just fell kind of quiet, and he said, "Do you like what you're doing?" - Ms. Norma, do you have the assurance that your sins are forgiven through Jesus Christ, our Lord? - Yes, I do. - Do you renounce the devil and his works and the sinful desires of the flesh? - Yes, I do. - It's all forgiven. You're brand-new. Nobody could do that but Jesus. I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. - Hallelujah. - Amen. [applause] - Hallelujah. Whoo! - Amen. - Hallelujah! Here she is, Ms. Norma Leah McCorvey, born-again Christian! - Hallelujah! - Hallelujah! [applause] When she jumped from spawn of Satan to a child of God, it just turned everything in this world upside-down. [dramatic music] - The Jane Roe in Roe versus Wade, the case that legalized abortion, says she's joining one of the most controversial anti-abortion groups in America, Operation Rescue. - Norma McCorvey has joined a leading anti-abortion group and found religion. - The pro-lifers have shown me what it's like to be a human being for the very first time in my whole life. They've loved me. They've nurtured me, and they've cared for me. I've never felt so good about being a woman or about being just a person than I have from these people. - Part of what the anti-abortion movement had that we did not have was, "Here...if you come here, you're gonna be good. "We're the good ones. We're the ones with God." - I think she's looking for something that feels like the answer, and a vulnerable, impressionable person, frankly, is being exploited by a very clever leader. She's looking for...for peace. - Are you interested in using her as a trophy at all? - No. There...there is no trophy for us. It is... - Come on. - You've gotta understand... - Would you care just as much about anybody else as you do Norma McCorvey? - Well, you know, God has given Norma to us. [applause] - I... see so many unusual turns of events that I'm not shocked by much anymore, but I... Was surprised. - The leaders of the pro-choice movement were devastated, and once more they said, "See? We couldn't trust her." I can imagine people, regular old people reading the newspaper or seeing it on television, thinking, "If Jane Roe is against abortion, it must be wrong." - All I'm simply doing is watching out for Norma's salvation and Norma's ass, and it's just that simple. - Now the media instead of being friendly toward her, all they wanted to do is shut her up and beat her out of the way, and that's what they do, and that's what the media does, and that's what the media tried to do to her. [dramatic music] ♪ - Ms. McCorvey, what happened? - Well, I've modified my rel...religious path. - Right. - Now I've changed my position on choice. - You realize that over the years you became something of a symbol of a woman's right to choose.

I'm not doing it for anyone else. - Does it occur to you that you may also be being used now by the Operation Rescue people for their purposes? - No, sir, and they...I will not let them use me. - That was like being given the Academy Award.

I've never had that privilege before, and the pro-life movement that I've encompassed now has given me that opportunity. ♪ - The whole event was structured as a memorial service, a kind of funeral. We actually had fetal remains in a tiny casket. We were there mourning for millions of unborn children, and Norma's presence validated that, because, of course, she was the cause of all this death.

I'm sorry for being so, so terribly, terribly dumb and so, so naive. I thought I was doing something right.

It was a comeback with such adulation, because the antis were so thrilled. - Jane Roe was now on our side. We were winning this social war. [cheers and applause] - It's hard for me to imagine how she came to terms with... oh, I don't know...betrayal. It's a betrayal that she did. [oxygen tank hissing] - These are just different trinkets that I've held on to over the years. That's a big pair of gold earrings... A pair of diamond earrings that Connie gave me.

That's just what the truth is. Am I gonna just give in to my every desire? Am I gonna just eat bonbons for the rest of my life and... and just grow up to be a blimp? Is that what...you know? And the answer is the...no. Well, I want bonbons. I want that. I want that. That's just who I am. I want you to let me be me. - But bonbons are different than love. - But that's not love. That's lust. And all you have to do is go into an emergency room on Friday night and early Saturday morning to see what homosexual lust does to each other so that they can get their own satisfaction.

Wade should be overturned. - We filed over 5,000 testimonies from women who've gone through legalized abortion. A lot of their lives have been just absolutely miserable since then. - You know, there were enough bad things happening. For that to be happening, it was one thing I just, like, didn't put on my plate, 'cause I... I couldn't do anything about it, so it was like, "Oh, what? It's Norma." - Hello. I'm Norma McCorvey. Today as a born-again Christian and a faithful Catholic, I'm working to reverse Roe. Your vote could determine who the next Supreme Court justice will be, the one justice who can either vote to continue Roe as the law of the land or vote to overturn that decision. all: Now and at the hour of our death. - Well, I came here to show my support for life and to get arrested along with all the other saints. - You're under arrest for trespassing. - Blessed art thou among women. - Clear the sidewalk. - God bless you, Norma.

You know, I took their money, and they put me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say, and that's what I'd say. - Wow. - I took their money, and they put me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say, and that's what I'd say. - Wow.

We were used to those kinds of personalities. - I got us a tape. - We saw that her greatest weaknesses could be exploited. ♪ - Was she told what to say? - [inhales] Norma was coached in what to say. We were concerned that Norma might not be rock-solid on the rights of the unborn child. We weren't sure where she kind of stood on that. - If a young woman wants to have an abortion, fine. You know, it's no skin off my ass. You know, that's why they call it choice. It's your choice. - Is it not the case that you did know where she stood on that? - Mm. Let me start again. I haven't talked about this ever publicly. This is a first. We were afraid that Norma might kind of spill the beans and tell our audience and the world through the news coverage that women had a right to abortion in the first trimester. That was unacceptable, so we wanted to control her speech to make sure she didn't say that. - Was she being paid by Operation Rescue? - No. No, she was not. [sniffs] - Yes, Norma would be paid. At a few points, she was actually on the payroll, so to speak. You know, there were so many different elements of the movement that were cutting checks to Norma. I...I really will never know how much was actually given to her. Money was a constant source of tension. And Norma would complain that she wasn't getting enough money. Her complaints were met with checks, several hundred dollars to a few thousand at a time... What we called "benevolence gifts." There was some worry that if Norma wasn't paid sufficiently that she would go back to the other side. - She did it for the money. She said what they wanted her to say, and she was willing to do it. - If Norma was being paid and she was being told what to say, do you see how it would be difficult for people to believe any of the things she said during that era? - Yes, yes. One day you're selling Nissan, and the next day you're selling Chevys. It depends on who you're getting your paycheck from. - Well, yeah, but she chose to be used. That's called work. That's what...you're getting paid for doing this. Are they using you? Who's using you? Who has hired you to do this thing? Are they using you, or are you using them? Which one? - You know, for Christians like me... There is no more important or authoritative voice than Jesus, and He said, "What does it profit a man "if he should gain the whole world and lose his soul?" When you do what we did to Norma... You lose your soul. - We're gonna go in there and have cosmetic surgery. Oh, that feels good. - [laughs] - Would you like something to drink? - I'll take a mimosa. Oh, thank you. [upbeat music] ♪ Oh.

They act... they all act like God sent them to preach the Gospel. - We're going to hear some quick reflections now from her daughter Melissa and granddaughter Jordan. - I just want to tell everybody thank you for all your love and support for her and everything everybody's done for her in the past. The last few months of her life, she started a documentary to show who she was in the end and... and as a person, just Norma. - Her whole life was an attempt to tell her real story. That never really happened. I hope it can posthumously. - God has a plan for everyone's life. It was written in the Book of Life that I get stomped on and shit on and everything like that, but then in the end I would prevail. [laughs] - Some of you knew Norma as Ms. Norma.
