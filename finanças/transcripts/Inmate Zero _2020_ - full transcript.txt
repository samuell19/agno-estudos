Shall we start with your earliest memory? The sea. Endless horizon, that was home. Anything else? Let me out! Medical trials. So, are you interested? Doesn't that annoy you? I don't notice it. Does it annoy you, Stone? All those hours ticking away. You're just stuck in here like the rest of us. Stalling tactics. I thought you'd be more direct. What makes you think I'd be more direct? If I was looking to stall, I'd ask why it's so dark in here. Diversion tactics. Turning things round to me. Guessing the pills are part of it. Headaches? That's none of your concern. Maybe you're an addict. Would you like to answer my question, or not? Whatever your offer is, the endgame's the same. There are no underhand tactics. Replace the death penalty with a full life sentence. - Simple. - Simple? What an appealing offer. Life without parole. See out my days staring at metal bars. The answer is no. Are you saying you want to die, Stone? Saying no the chance of justice on the mainland? If a place like this can exist off-borders, outside of the law, then there's no justice for me anywhere. Thanks for the shallow offer, though. You were in US Special Forces and then a bodyguard for the late State Senator Alan. You've served your whole adult life. These trials are to do good. To find cures for cancer, AIDS, Alzheimer's. That file also states that I killed Senator Alan, and then murdered his wife and children. Are you saying you didn't? Does it matter anymore? If, if you believe you're innocent, you could buy yourself some time. If I believe? Jesus. Your execution date is set for next month. I'm offering you your best chance to get off this island, regardless of what you think. You're outside the law here. Outside society, forgotten. I'm giving you a chance to turn things around. I've killed people. It was a job, and it wasn't pleasant. The one time I protected someone, I got hung out to dry. And I've ended up out here, off-limits. Forgotten, as you put it. You ought to think about your own involvement in these experiments before worrying about my fate, Doctor. I've seen what they do to the trial subjects. Give me the chair over that any day. Oh! What are you doing? No! No, no, no. No! No, she was helping, that's all. What happened? Well, a bird came through the window. What's going on with all these lights? What's wrong with it? It's dead, is what. Not quite the fancy city living you had in mind out here. Eh, doctor? Uh, Lennon, can you take Stone back to her cell? Stone? Think about what I said. That's all. Is that all that happened with the good doctor? You both seem a bit flustered, Stone. Sorted you out, did he? Not again. Shut that music off, right now, or I'll knock a week off all your fucking due dates! Always figured Brooks for a faggot. Give it a rest, Woodhouse. Lennon's part of Father Kitsell's God Squad. Only into altar boys, aren't you darlin'? Me on the other hand, I like a proper woman. I said, fucking turn that music off, right now! Don't worry, Stone. You'll get your chance. I'm make sure of that. Maybe when I get off the chair, stiff and cold. Guess that's the only way a dick like you gets any. Oh, look, Lennon. She slipped. Maybe one day, you'll slip. -And I'll get a front row seat. -Maybe. Then again, maybe not. Thought you'd like a new cellmate. Don't worry, Stone. One dyke's snatch is the same as any other, right? Where's the air in this place? I don't know whether to freeze or burn to death. I'm Conway. Sisterhood call me Blonde. Got some tats yourself, girl. Is that the Special Forces or something? Hard fucking core. So, this is the island, death row. No possibility of parole. Who'd've thought Brits would be back into that game, eh? You the same Stone that killed Senator Alan? You're pure of birth, Stone, but you're either deaf, or you got something against the sisterhood. One, I'm not your sister. Two, I've got something against anyone who invades my space. Is that what the Senator did? Invade your space? Shame about his wife and daughter. Heard he invaded their space, too. But they hung you out to dry, a real patsy. You feeling okay? - What? - You seem nervous. You want to check me out, doctor? You know, Senator Alan was one of ours. Was gonna bring the real rain. You seem to know a lot about my case. You wanna be my lawyer? Dead girls don't need lawyers. Fight! Fight! Fight! - Silence! Oh, for fuck's sake, Stone. What happened? -Let her bleed out. -Conway attacked her, I saw it. You know what you're saying, don't you, Lennon? The truth. Get out of my way. There's a pulse! Get a move on! We need some help here. Jesus. I'm better off bleeding out in the cell. Razor shank to her ankle. She's bleeding! I've got my hands full already, Lennon. Take her back. It's her due date soon, anyway. Just do your job, Bragg, for fuck's sake. Get her on the bed and bind her to it tightly. She's bleeding out of her ankle. She's not running anywhere. You bind her down or I don't touch her. Twat. All right. Unless you're a doctor, get off my wing. Thanks, Saint Lennon. I can wait at the door for a while. You're not gonna give me anything? Why waste good painkillers on you lot when I can sell them for twice the price on the island? They all need it this far out. Times are good when no one's watching. I can hardly breathe! What's with the air con? Ah! What the fuck? You seen this? Yeah, good protein. Fuck's sake. Oh, my God. Christ on a bike! Where the hell did he come from? D block! He was trying to escape from the labs, but got ill halfway across the island. Well, you might have noticed that this this is the women's block. Tell D to look after their own. He's one of the warden's new prisoners. He jumped from the test lab mid-trial. You're just gonna leave this in here? Jesus. What the hell is wrong with him? What happened to you? You've taken things to the next level, bitch! That one's a goner. You better do your thing. You mean the last rites? Do we even know if he's Catholic? Does he look like he cares? Let's pray I never have to administer them to you. I would hate to lie to the Lord. In the name of the Father, of the Son, of the Holy Spirit, amen. Oh, God. Oh, come on. I didn't realize you army lot were such babies. May the good Lord grant you the gifts of the Holy Spirit. And may he free you, save you, and raise you. In the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Hey. What's going on down there? Ah. Stone. You were reading Treasure Island from the library, I believe. How are you finding our desert island here? Struggling to find treasure. Doctor Brooks lent that book last, I think. You fishing to know if he asked me? Well, he did. And I said no to the tests. Is that what happened to that guy? I wish I could hurry it up for those in pain. What's stopping you? Faith, that with enough prayer, we will all survive. Is that what you were discussing with the Butcher earlier? -We were praying. -For all the people she cut up? She was praying that her daughter would not be punished for her mistakes. That's the only family she has left. You should join us. Maybe one day I won't have a choice. God knows, the things I've seen on this island. Poor souls from across the world. Times have changed, Stone. We don't know ourselves anymore. Who knows what that young man has just endured? I cured cancer today. I thought he was already dead! Oh, bag him up quickly. He stinks. I'm gonna be sick! You're just gonna leave him? Shh! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! What the fuck is that? What the fuck has happened, Lennon? Looks like some kind of disease. He was dead. I watched the guy die. Are you okay? What about the staff? Where are they? Shit, that's dead. You're out of bullets? I only fired once. Yeah. That was my one lucky bullet. I don't usually load that gun. What the fuck are you doing this job for? Stay low, and keep quiet. Torches on! All prisoners, get back in your cells right now. Nick nack paddy wack, give a dog a bone... That's not a fucking request! We've got a problem here. Your new prisoner died. I'm assuming he was one of yours. It was horrific. You've gone too far this time. This isn't the time. When is a good time to call you back, Warden? Are you trying to stop me from leaving? You won't silence me. First, we lose mainland contact. Now, we're in lockdown. The electricity's all over the place. Butcher! Butcher! Get them back in, Butcher! I am not the boss around here, young Woodhouse! These ladies act off of their own free will. Free? We have orders to shoot to kill all ladies, starting with you. All we want to know is, what's going on down there? What's going on is you all getting back in your fucking cells! We're in lockdown. Shit. Are you all right, man? No lights. Look upon them rookie faces, them panicking. I'd say, you don't know any more than we do. I know how to use this fucking rifle, you black bitch. It's a shotgun, you fool. So go on, what's your plan? What are you doing? Look at his face, that guard. Load up. Shoot to kill. We're gonna sweep this block clean. I'm glad I get to pull the trigger on these fucking bitches. I thought it was a prisoner. Warden, are you there? Shoot to kill, right? Get to the stairs. For fuck's sake, come on Lennon. Wait, there's more. Lock it! No one touch anything. I ain't touching any goddamn thing ever again. How the fuck did you get in C-block, you faggot? I'll take your fucking face off, bitch. Shh! Put the fucking knife down, Butcher. There's enough death in here without you turning the place into a... Lennon, we can't let them walk around in here with our dicks in their hands. You don't have no control in here. So, who's in control then, huh? Who's in control? What? You and your addict girl leading us now? We gotta keep moving. Trigger-happy Captain Cuntface, the voice of reason. - You need to relax. - Relax? Relax? A pack of misfit twats like you won't make it four inches... What in the hell? You don't have no authority around here anymore, governor. Officer Woodhouse, shoot the Butcher, then Stone. We're all that's left from out there. If you're gonna get out of here alive, you're gonna need us. And you need us more than we need you. Oh, Christ. These are our medical files. Why do you have my daughter's blood type? And her details? Put them down. You put your names down for the tests. What do you expect? "Blood type: No Match." "Proceed." With what? I didn't agree to anything. Well, forget about that now. Let's deal with the present situation. Situation you started. There are more survivors out there. Who's this? Your girlfriend? Oi! Put that down. Put it down, junkie! Yo, yo, yo, come on. Sit, now, sit. Don't even think about pouring that drink, nonce, or getting in this fucking block will be your last great escape. I'll make sure... Is the power down, or was that a fuse? The surges blow the fuses. The box for this block is in the laundry. That's next to Dr. Brooks' office. We need a doctor up here. I'm all right, Stone. I'm still alive. But in the infirmary, you saw how that spreads. I don't feel any different. I don't have it. Stone? Shh! Stone! Oh, my God! Stone, what... Shh! Save it for the warden's office and keep quiet. Shit! All full clips, bar one in the chamber. They must have shot each other. What the hell is happening? Come on, you really don't know? I don't work in the labs. Whatever this is, it's... Engineered. No shit! Take a gun. They're dead, Brooks. You're not helping anyone by joining them. You look like you need a drink. Help yourself. Maybe they need to fight and split. They'll likely shoot each other? Ain't we supposed to be helping them? Help them? What Warden means, rookie, is we'll move faster with less people. They're fucking dead anyway. Get over there and keep an eye on them. We're not moving anywhere. What's wrong with you? You look like shit. It's just the heat. Tie her up. I'll show that fucking mute my definition of cold turkey. These will keep you going for a short while. Got a bit of an habit of your own there, Doctor? The new prisoner was brought back in from the island. He tried to escape. Which means, it could be worse out there than it is in here. My sister's out there. It seems to spread through blood and possibly saliva. It means any of you could be infected and we won't even know. We have to find a way out. They seem to hate light. We wait until dawn. Then we can walk out of here. Walk out? There's no way off the island. Where do you think you'll walk to? Looks like your girl Butcher over there is too good for the rest of us. Warden don't include a new guard, but a bitch who cut up 20 people? Yeah, but 20 members of the National Front. So things aren't so black and white, are they? You're gonna need to choose a side. Ain't gonna be a hard choice, is it? I'm locking up, not locked up. Well, you're locked up now. You little bitch. You wanna get off this island alive? That little committee over there are the only things standing between us and getting out. And a hundred diseased inmates. And that there is our bait. You don't owe'em shit. They're gonna kill you, too. What are you talking about? You ain't getting anywhere in this dump without me. How did you get into the women's block anyway? I was gonna ask you the same thing, sweetheart. Once a week, people come from the mainland with supplies. Without communications, that won't be for another five days. How does it feel to be trapped? May I remind you exactly why you're trapped here? I'm guessing you've killed more people than I ever could. So don't lecture me about breaking the law, bitch. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. He's infected! No! Fuck that. Do him now. Help me. Brooks, there's got to be something you can do. - Stone, I've told you. - Bullshit! Oh, no. He saved my life. Help him, or I swear! What's that? Saint Leonard, patron saint of prisoners. This island's named after him. You just gotta have faith, Stone. Faith hasn't done me many favors. You don't believe in heaven? If there is one, you and Brooks are the only ones getting in. Probably due to naivety more than anything else. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. The beach. The beach. It is beautiful. Brooks, do something! Fuck! Quick! I can't help him. Please. Please. That's the main gate. More survivors. They're probably fucking riddled with it out there. We can't just leave them out there. Yes, we fucking can. It's a fucking act. Just leave them. My baby girl is out there. You're just going to delay my search with that ankle, army girl. It takes two to open those gates. So what do you have out there, Stone? Brooks, you stay here. The people who need help are out there. Oh, so you're a hero now? They'll kill you the minute you go out there. My sister's out there. What's the quickest way outside? Through the main cell block. Oh, dear Mary, mother of Jesus. - Oh, the smell. - Shh. Look, the lights are still trying to come on. Generators aren't topped up. They won't last long. Where are they? Outside the prison walls. Any other source of power in this place? Only the generators for the electric chairs. They stay fully-charged. Yeah, you really have your priorities right, eh? We can't see what we're dealing with from here. - I'm finding my sister. - My baby girl, too. Be sure to kill anything that isn't human. - They're all human. - I'm serious. You left the gates open. No. Oh, my baby. My little baby. Jesus, what have I done? Daylight's not the problem. Okay. All right, look at me. Okay. - Is she okay? - I think she's in shock. Girl, did you see my sister out there? Elizabeth, my age, short, grey hair. Could people have splintered off in the panic? - I don't know. - Hey, don't worry. We're gonna get out of here as soon as we can make a call to the mainland. We'll see. I wasn't expecting visitors today. You know, I knew a little girl just like you once. Hey, man, touch her again, and you're gonna feel real pain. We need to find somewhere more secure. It's not exactly safe in here. Isolation. It's close, and pretty tight down there, if we get power back to that block. It's got real quiet outside. Maybe it's over. Just stick close together. The Butcher was right. About what? It's gone quiet. Maybe it's over. I mean, how long could something survive in that state? "If I shall die before I wake, "I pray the Lord my soul to take. "And should I live for other days, "I pray that God will guide my ways." Trying to remember who you are, Stone? Are you planning to die a martyr, Dr. Brooks? I was hoping not to die at all. You? It makes no difference. They get me out there or they put me on the chair in here. How do you resign yourself to death? I, err... Run out of words of wisdom? I knew the Senator's family. I think that everyone, for whatever reason, is in here because of him. I've profiled murderers for nine years. You didn't do it. He did, didn't he? He beat her black and blue. So, one day, I drove him to the middle of nowhere, and told him if he did it again... The next day, he got up and did the same thing. Except this time, he killed them all. If I had gone with my gut... So, it's guilt that's keeping you waiting for the chair. I don't remember much about my real parents, but I do remember the ocean we lived near. Never-ending horizons. One day, I want to go back. I wanted... To go back one last time. This place really teaches you to let hope go. What are the pills for, really? Stalling tactics. Whatever happens, don't let that thing get ahold of me. Please. If we can all hear the music, then the sick people can, too. Sorry. Just listen to it very quietly. It's safer. Do you think this has happened on the mainland, too? I'm sure it's contained here. I'm frightened. We're gonna get out of this. Do you think we can get a line up, make contact with the mainland? We can try. Get that faggot out there to fix the wires. Find a route across main block, away from the corridors. Look, those bitches out there, they ain't gonna listen. They're just killers. Use them as bait to get outside. - Somewhere we can be seen. - Mmm. You put a guard's uniform on, and we'll fly out of here. What are you playing at? Get back in your box! You want any chance of survival, you do exactly what I say. That was the diseased prisoner. We're all dead anyway. At least, this way, I get to choose. You don't get to leave this that easily. I thought we cracked it this time. Rewriting history. Your fucking research started all this. I had a big vision, cure all diseases. Give humanity a chance. Yeah, let death row prisoners from around the world take the risk. - How exactly did I become the bad guy here? Some of us can see the bigger picture. You want to kill me yourself, soldier? Go ahead. Won't make any difference. It's here now, in all of us. What are you talking about? You fucking idiot. They're from outside the prison. It's not light that affects them. What the hell are you talking about? How do you get to and from the mainland? Crowe, how do your people get to the island? Helicopter. But the comms are down. If we can make one phone call and get everyone on the roof, they'll see us, right? Do you think they'll take you? - They'll take the girl, Dr. Brooks. The whole island's expendable. Good luck with the heroics, marine. Just shut up and listen! We need to get the electricity back up and running first. Who do you think you're speaking to? Your rules went out the window along with your fucked-up morals. You said the electric chairs have the only accessible generator inside the prison. They're going to isolation. We're getting out of here. Elizabeth! Oh. Oh, Elizabeth! Oh, no, stop! - Stop! - Don't touch her! Please! Kill her, and you'll never get off this island. The comm system is voice activated, mine only. We can help her on the mainland. Or she'll spread the disease there, too. Oh, she recognizes herself. She's still there. What'll it take for you to get us off the island? Try and give me a sober answer now. Stop your shooting, you stupid boys. It's not doing nothing. I'll stop shooting when they stop coming. I said save it, fool. It don't do nothing! We can't fucking get out of here anyway. Come out of the way! What's going on with them? Look. They're not going anywhere. Unlike us, they can wait forever. There's got to be another way out of here. What we need is a distraction. Get them to one end of the unit, and we run out of the other. Right. How y'all gonna do that? - This. Cut him so he bleeds. Shove him out there. Ain't you a brave thing, pussy wood? Take this and go find yourself a conscience. Right. Be all you can be, rookie! Don't patronize me with your fucking attitude and your killing spree fairytales. Do you want to know the difference between us? You got caught. Get all we need together. It's time to take our chances on the outside. They've cleared the other way. The rookie'll keep'em busy for a while. It's Stone! What are you doing? It's Stone! All right, listen up, you fucking faggot. This disease is our ticket home. You got into this wing, and you're gonna get us out. I want to know all routes, secret passageways, air ducts. I'll show you my secret passage. I mean it, you fucking bender! If I die in here, it'll be after you. I'll make sure of it. What the fuck do you think you're doing? Back off, officer, or I'll personally make sure you never leave this island. Keep back. - What happened? - Long story. Warden, there is an execution chamber on this level, right? Why? If we can start the generator up, will it light these halls, keep the diseased at bay? It's only hooked up to this floor. That'll do. Can you wire it to the lighting? Yes. Is it over? Oh, yeah, baby. It's over. I'm gonna show your buddy, Butcher, who can touch who. Where's Darnell? Woodhouse is losing it, doing that to another guard. A black guard. I don't think he... Drop your guns! Right where I wanted you all, cornered. Ah, you run out of guards to kill? You're not thinking straight, Woodhouse. I'm thinking crystal, you mouthy twat! You've still got time to get out of this, officer. Oh, I'm getting out. Alive. You and your fucking monster munch sister and a bunch of cons? No one will look twice at us. Me, however. Remember our fucking deal, Woodhouse, or I will fuck you up myself. Don't ever bother, slaphead. Mainland will only come if they hear my voice. Fuck the mainland. We'll just be thrown into another cell, given a new date for execution. There's boats out there. And nearly 1,000 miles till the next shoreline. What about the kid? She won't last two seconds out there. We'll make it quick and painless for them all. You see? Sweetheart, really. Are we doing this shit or what? Let's start with this one. I can't hold this damn thing much longer. You do as you're fucking told, bumboy. That's right, officer. Nothing in here is fair. Well, that's our power source gone. This better be the right way through, I swear. Give me an excuse to lie about an escape route. Psycho. How's this gonna work? Well, I'm not leaving her here, if that's what you think. And you need my voice. It's the only way to the back of reception. Unless you wanna go through the front. It's full of diseased. How many, you think? There's a vent over there. You can go check. How are we gonna fit through there? Speak for yourself. Where you going, girl? I... I can check. Five. We're low on ammo. I can do it. Moses? I can run through. No. You're in no fit state. Moses? You'll get infected for sure. There must be another way. The public execution room. That's off the reception across the cell block. It's up there. Through the back door, down the metal stairs. Comes out in the rear corridor. Expendable now, huh? Okay, Warden, you got your way. Time to go. Get us out of here! What about power to the phone lines? That's separate to the mains. How do you know that stuff? I used to work in finance in Cannes. Lost a lot of people a lot of money. All I got was the blueprints to this shithole. -Thought I was some gay serial killer? -Don't flatter yourself. Less talking and more fixing. Call the mainland. You wanna cure her, right? Crowe, Jane. Warden. This is Valley Base receiving. Go ahead. Prison overrun. Helicopters needed for... Helicopters for what? Sorry? Order 1409. Annihilation of the entire island. The whole island... One experiment... Don't fight... Valley base. That's it. Dead. We have to assume they're coming. Yeah, coming to do what, though? Is there a back exit from here? There's a slim stairway from the public gallery in the execution room to an emergency exit. How slim is slim? Over here, you son of a bitch! Run! Come on, Chloe, run! Try the cells for flashlights and ammo. It's okay. It's okay. Shh. - I did not... - Shh, come on. He's gone. Come on. No! Run, Stone. Stop wasting time and go! Forgive me, child.
