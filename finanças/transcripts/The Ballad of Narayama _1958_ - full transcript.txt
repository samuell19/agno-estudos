Does Orin of the tree stump live here? Excuse me, are you Orin? Yes. Hello. Who are you? I came from the village on the other side of the mountain. Then, you must be... Yes, I was sent by your family. Welcome. Please come inside. You must be tired from crossing the mountain pass. Yes. ~ Inviting in the messenger ~ ~ Orin is filled with anticipation and can hardly wait ~ ~ For him to sit down ~ In our village, there is a woman who has recently become a widow. Well, is that right? Her husband's funeral took place just three days ago. How old is she? She's 45. Then she's the same age as my son Tatsuhei. They're well-matched in age. She'll be perfect for him. You've brought wonderful news. So then, when can she come to us? Granny! ~ Just as Orin uttered the question, her grandson Kesakichi called her ~ I'm hungry! Is there anything to eat? There should be some roasted beans. I'm not having any gas-causing beans. You know what old man Amaya said? He said, "Your granny can eat anything. She still has a good set of teeth. She can even munch on pinecones or roasted beans, can't she?" What nonsense! You have 33 teeth, don't you? I only have 28. Really? 28 make a full set. But I'm sure you have more. Kesakichi! Granny has 33 teeth! Kesakichi! ~ In a corner in the back room ~ ~ My granny found herself a set of 33 demon teeth ~ ~ It is a dewy evening ~ ~ It is a dewy evening, indeed, and yet... ~ It'll be almost a year since your mama passed away. Stay away from dangerous places when you play, all right? If you fall into a ravine like your mama, you'll die. Let's go. Tatsuhei. Tatsuhei, I have good news for you. You'll have a new wife. Why the glum face? A messenger came from my old village. There's a woman who became a widow just three days ago. Her name is Tama. I see. How old is she? She's 45, the same age as you. She'll come to us after the 49-day mourning period. Come on, now. Why don't you look happy? I'm too old to get excited about getting a wife. ~ After the Narayama Festival has come around three times ~ ~ Flowers bloom from chestnut seeds ~ The Obon festival is coming soon. I was expecting to hear somebody start singing the festival song. When three years pass, we get three years older. I'll be 70 next year. You must take me to Narayama then. ~ Upon turning 70 ~ ~ One is expected to go to Narayama ~ ~ It is a long-held tradition of the village ~ ~ Even the Narayama festival song ~ ~ Reminds one of the passing of years ~ Tatsuhei. Be strong, or you won't be able to take me to Narayama. You'll have a new wife soon. Come on, cheer yourself up. Mama, why don't you let me carry you on my back? Why, of course. It'll be good practice. Well? Do I feel heavy or light to you? You feel lighter than I expected. Even so, Narayama is a very difficult mountain to climb. You must have strong legs to take me there. What's the matter? We still have a long time till that day comes. You're wrong. When the new year comes, I'm taking my journey there. Now that you'll have a new wife, my mind is at ease. Except for one thing, though. These teeth of mine. Mama, what are you doing? I'm ashamed of having a full set of teeth. I'm near the age to take my journey to Narayama, but my teeth make me look as if I eat as much as a young woman. Tatsuhei, I want to go to Narayama as an old woman with no teeth. ~ In a corner in the back room ~ ~ Orin found herself a set of 33 demon teeth ~ Amaya! Let's go over to my house now! And you count my mama's teeth. I meant no insult. I was just singing what I heard your son sing. Don't get worked up at me. Kesakichi! ~ The mountain festival comes once a year ~ ~ Tie on a headband and be ready to feast ~ ~ In a corner in the back room ~ ~ My granny found herself a set of 33 demon teeth ~ Kesakichi! You ingrate! You grew up doted on by your granny. How could you sing such a song and make fun of her? Kesakichi! Granny's teeth are demon's teeth! You jerk! No dinner for you tonight! ~ On a July evening ~ ~ Showers fall outside as the family has a humble dinner ~ ~ Their heavy hearts in turmoil ~ ~ Disturb their nightly dreams ~ Here you go. We should tell Kesakichi about it, too. You'll have a new mother, a woman from my old village. It's too soon, but I have a feeling that she'll be with us by the festival. You'll be freed from the cooking chores when she comes. Wait a minute! I don't want any new mother! Kesakichi! I'll have a wife, so we don't need a new mother. If cooking is too much for you, my wife will do it. So let it be! You fool! Then don't eat your food! Kesakichi wants to marry Matsu who lives by the pond. Idiot! Stop blabbering! ~ It's not too late even after turning 30 ~ ~ Having a new member doubles the burden of the family ~ ~ After the Narayama Festival has come around three times ~ ~ Flowers bloom from chestnut seeds ~ ~ In a corner in the back room ~ ~ My granny found herself a set of 33 demon teeth ~ Rice. I smell cooked rice. Oh, it's hot. You wretched fool! If you want it so badly, I'll give you some. How disgraceful. You look like a hungry devil. Listen, Mata, since we are neighbors and old friends, I'll tell you what the villagers say about you. So listen, Mata. People say your family is the stingiest in the village. They're too cheap to prepare a send-off feast for your journey to Narayama. You're a year older than me. You ought to have taken the journey long ago. But you're still here. Everybody was expecting you to be gone before spring came, but now it's summer. What a miserable fellow you are. You have no intention of going to Narayama, do you? Your son and his wife don't even feed you, so you wander into my house attracted by the smell of cooked rice. What a miserable wretch. More rice, more rice! All right, I'll give you some more. It's only once a year that we get to eat white rice. I cooked plenty of rice for tonight's festival. Here he is, eating our neighbor's rice. You're a disgrace! Come on, get up! Let's go! Don't hurt me! It's you, his son, that's a disgrace! It's our festival day, why don't you feed him for a change? You look like a stranger. Did you come for the festival? Is this where Tatsuhei lives? I knew it. You've come from the other side of the mountain. And you must be Tama, aren't you? Yes, that's right. There is a festival today in my village, too. But everybody told me I should celebrate the festival here, so I came today. I see. Well, then, come inside. I'm so glad you came. ~ Seeing the new wife for her son ~ ~ The mother is filled with joy ~ ~ She has no worries now ~ ~ Even though her body will rot on Narayama ~ Here, enjoy the food. My! So much! I'll go get Tatsuhei for you now. People in my village said I should have the festival feast here rather than there, so I left before having breakfast. Go ahead and eat. You don't have to be shy. They said you're a kind woman and urged me to be on my way to come here. You should have come sooner. I thought you'd be with us by yesterday. The messenger who came to see you was my brother. He told me you're a good woman, so I wanted to come here as soon as I could. Why did you wait by the tree stump? You should have come inside sooner. Since I came by myself, I felt awkward. My brother was supposed to accompany me, but he started drinking for the festival last night and got drunk. And he told me to go on my own because you're a kind woman. He's been saying that since last night. Oh, I could have come to get you if that was the case. I wish you had. I would have carried you on my back all the way here. Dear Tama. Dear Mother. Oh, dear. Are you choking? Eat slowly, as much as you want. That was uncomfortable. I'm taking my journey to Narayama as soon as the new year comes. What? My brother mentioned it too. But he also said there's no need for you to hurry. Yes, there is. The god of Narayama will praise me, the sooner I go. Come on, now. You can eat everything on your tray. I caught the trout myself. Really? You're good at catching trout? Oh, yeah. Tatsuhei and Kesakichi are both terrible at it. Nobody else in the village is better at it than I am. Is that right? So you caught these magnificent trout. I know a good fishing spot for trout. I'll show you later. Go ahead and eat them. I have plenty of dried ones stocked up. I'll go find Tatsuhei. ~ Oh, my son's new wife is a good woman ~ ~ Stepping out, feeling happy, the mother stops in her tracks ~ ~ She was the beauty of the village as a young bride ~ ~ Even after her husband died, she lived free of bad rumors ~ ~ And nobody talked behind her back ~ ~ But now because of her healthy teeth ~ ~ People call her a greedy old woman ~ ~ She cannot take the journey to Narayama in such shame ~ Mother, what's the matter? Take your time and eat as much as you want. I'll bring Tatsuhei right away. Since I'm nearing the age to go to Narayama, I no longer have all my teeth. ~ The mountain festival is held once a year ~ ~ Tie on a headband and be ready to feast ~ ~ When unwanted and shaken to death on purpose ~ ~ All human ties are cut off like a severed rope ~ ~ Abandon granny in the back mountain ~ ~ Crabs come crawling from the back mountain ~ ~ In a corner in the back room ~ ~ My granny found herself a set of 33 demon teeth ~ Tatsuhei! Tatsuhei! Mama! Tatsuhei, your new wife has arrived. Orin the crone! Orin the crone! This is Tama. She's your new wife. Now, sit across from her and eat with her. You cooked white rice? Our once-a-year treat? Only once a year... Damn it! Mama, eat as much of it as you like. I'll eat it too, so you eat plenty. If you can't chew, then just swallow it. Eat till you're full. It's just rice! It's just rice! Damn it! - Orin the crone! - Orin the crone! You brats! Never abuse my mama! ~ The maple leaves ~ ~ Have turned ~ ~ Bright red ~ ~ As the fruit of love ripens ~ Hey! Don't you have to help out harvesting rice? No way! When there's nothing to eat, I shouldn't work, or I'll go hungry. I'm always hungry, but my belly keeps growing. No matter how much I eat, everything goes to the baby inside. Have some roasted beans. My parents are urging me to move in with you. Can I have dinner with your family starting tonight? Do that! Seeing your belly will make my granny realize her time is up. She'll be ashamed to have a great-grandchild. ~ The harvest in autumn brings sorrow ~ ~ Even as the rice ripens to a golden hue ~ We can see Narayama very clearly today. Don't stand around, dear. Let's finish harvesting the rice. ~ And boughs hang low as if crying ~ There's no need to rush harvesting this tiny plot of rice field. Mama, you go ahead of me. What's the matter? I felt as if I was carrying my mama on my back and it made me sad. What's wrong? You hurt your leg. Your son doesn't feed you but still makes you carry a load like that? Come on, you're almost there. Hold onto me and walk. Oh! It hurts! You're a fool. Instead of suffering like this, you should go to Narayama. Narayama is a blessed place where a god resides. I'm going there as soon as the new year comes. I don't wanna go there. I'm not going to Narayama. When will you take your journey? As soon as the new year comes. Not until the new year? It looks like the snow will come early this year. Wouldn't it be better for you to go before it snows? I hear that you have to cross seven valleys to get to Narayama. It would be impossible in the snow. I'm the lucky sort. So, just as it was for Otori of the salt house, I'm sure the snowfall will wait until I reach Narayama. My granddad went in summer. It's stupid to go in summer. Leaves and grasses will keep you alive. It's best to go when it seems like there will be a snowfall but before the snow covers everything. Then you should go soon. She should wait till later. She should go soon! She should wait till later! You bastard! Thief! Thief! Thief! Punish the thief for his crime! Carry out the judgment of Narayama! Tatsuhei! Kesakichi! Don't panic! Matsu, wake up! Carry out the judgment of Narayama! Be sure to come barefoot! - Carry out the judgment! - Punish the thief! Let's go! Carry out the judgment of Narayama! You damn Amaya! Where did the thief go? That way! We won't let him get away! Carry off all their food. More stashes found! Dear! Dear! Amaya was the thief! The louse! He tried to make off with my bale of beans. Thieving runs in his blood. His father was punished with the judgment too. Now, we'll distribute the spoils! Line up! I'm first! Just divide up everything! Hey! This fellow is wearing sandals! How dare you! You wretched dotard! My leg is injured! You journey-evading coot! It's the rule. Go ahead and beat him up! Stop! Wait a minute! Everybody, listen to me. I know it's the rule. But he still came prepared to do battle, even though he's hurt. Just deny him his share, and forgive him. I'm not sure if we'll be able to get through the year after paying the land tax. Amaya has twelve people in his family, while we have eight. But we're just as badly off, as we have youngsters with healthy appetites. We go through food carelessly. We should ration our food, as Matsu has a bottomless appetite. She came to us for food, rather than to be Kesakichi's wife. Her family must have kicked her out, with the way she stuffs herself. People are saying that to have peace of mind, we should get rid of Amaya's family since thieving runs in their blood. When Amaya's father was punished with the judgment of Narayama, the family fed on dug-up roots to pass one winter. People say they must have had some food hidden in the hills. Beans again? Oh! They're cooked well. Restrain yourself a little! They say that the more of them you eat, the more they increase by adding water. Matsu, then there would be none if you didn't eat, wouldn't there? Really? Kesakichi, slap Matsu on the cheek! I lined up first at the judgment last night and got the largest share! Don't mind them. Here, eat the beans. What a joke. My share from last night was all small potatoes. I was wondering why my potatoes didn't do so well. Amaya had dug 'em up. We all had more stolen than what we got back last night. We were getting back our stolen things, rather than sharing the spoils, then. We have to make them pay. Hey, when it gets dark, there's no doubt Amaya's gang will come stealing. We've gotta deal with them soon, or we can't even sleep peacefully. We've gotta get rid of them soon! There are 12 of them, though. Why don't you dig a large hole and bury them? How dreadful! Where would you bury all 12 of them together? It's no laughing matter! Everybody is staying home and thinking about it. All your dreadful talk must have attracted the crows. We might have some funerals tonight. Starting tonight, Amaya's family might become fewer in number, one family member at a time. Mama, you might want to go to Narayama next year. At last, you're ready to take me to Narayama. I feel relieved now. My grandma from my old village also went to Narayama. So did my mother-in-law. So, I must go too. In this village with little food to eat, there's a song that goes like this: "Gin the untidy woman, who lived by the kaya tree, held in her arms sons, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren." I don't want to be mocked liked that. Don't worry. If your great-grandchild is born, then I'll chuck it into the ravine. You'll never be mocked like Gin in the song. Fool! I'll sing about Granny! I can do it easily. Right, Matsu? I told you I'd do it. Yeah. Make sure you do. ~ Look outside, Father The trees are all bare of leaves ~ ~ Carry a wooden frame on your back It's time for you to take her ~ Oh, yeah. You sing well. ~ Abandon granny in the back mountain ~ ~ Crabs come crawling from the back mountain ~ Oh, yeah. ~ But a door blocks their way from coming into the house ~ ~ Crabs don't sing a nocturnal song like birds ~ Oh, yeah! Tatsuhei. Let me see your face well while I'm still living here. The thought of my journey has been weighing on your mind. But you will take me to Narayama next year. Tama. You've been a better daughter-in-law than the previous one who died. Tonight, I'll show you my secret trout-fishing spot. This is the place. Stick your hands into that hole there, and you're sure to catch some trout. Don't tell anybody about this place, all right? It's the hole under that rock. Be sure to remember the exact spot. Where is Kesakichi? We'd better not talk about Amaya and his family anymore. ~ Warm, autumnal sunlight ~ ~ Filters into my house ~ ~ I have lived in this dear, old home ~ ~ For many, many years ~ ~ Yet looking back ~ ~ It seems as if it has been a dream ~ Ask the people who have been to Narayama to come tonight. The new year is still four days away, but it's better to prepare early. There's no need to hurry. Nonsense. I'd rather do it sooner than later, before the arrival of my great-grandchild. Hurry and go ask those people to come. You must catch them before they leave for work in the hills. Oh, look. Woolly aphids are flying. It's a sign that there will be snow when I go to Narayama. Now, go on. I'll go to Narayama on my own tomorrow, if you won't! Come on! Making a journey to Narayama is difficult. We sympathize with you. You must adhere to the rules of the journey to Narayama. Rule One, you must not speak once you enter Narayama. You must adhere to the rules of the journey to Narayama. Rule Two, make sure nobody sees you when you leave your house for the journey. You must adhere to the rules of the journey to Narayama. Rule Three, you must never look back on your return journey from Narayama. Follow these directions to Narayama: Take the path around the foot of the back mountain. Go around the foot of the next mountain and pass a holly tree. Climb the third mountain until you come across a pond. Go around the pond. Then climb the fourth mountain by a flight of stone steps. When you reach the top, Narayama will be before you across the valley. Advance, with the valley to your right and the next mountain to your left. It's six miles long to skirt around the valley. Midway, the road takes seven turns. That place is called the Valley of the Seven Turns. When you pass the Valley of the Seven Turns, you will enter the path to Narayama. The path to Narayama is a trackless way. Keep climbing through the oak trees toward the top where the god of Narayama waits for you. Listen, if you don't want to go all the way to Narayama, you can turn back alone from the Valley of the Seven Turns. Well, it's part of the tradition to let you know about that secretly. So, now you've been told. ~ The six organs of sense make us aware ~ ~ It's not easy to accompany a journey to Narayama ~ ~ The burden carried on my back weighs down on my shoulders ~ Hey! What do you think you're doing? You old coot! Where are you running? Help me! Stop! You're not getting away! Damn that old wretch! Orin! Orin! Tatsuhei, open the door! What's the matter? What's going on? He bit off the rope tying him down and ran. Listen Mata, "When unwanted and shaken to death on purpose, all human ties are cut off like a severed rope." That song phrase applies to you! By refusing to go to Narayama, you're risking your ties to the mountain gods and your son! No, I'm not going. You wretch! Don't force him anymore tonight! Come on, I'll take you home. No! I don't wanna go home! Miserable coot! Come on! - Stop it! - Enough! Stop this racket! Just take the old man and Granny to Narayama! Kesakichi, I don't need you telling me to go! I'm going to Narayama tomorrow night! ~ Lamenting the passing year ~ ~ A crescent moon rises in the winter sky ~ ~ As streaming clouds make shadows sway on the ground ~ ~ Love for his mother ~ ~ Makes the son's heart waver ~ ~ The ties between mother and son are spun on the wheel of fortune ~ ~ The passing of time reaches the end of a year ~ ~ The son carries on his back ~ ~ His beloved mother ~ You must be Tama, aren't you? Well, then, come inside. ~ Go ahead and eat. You don't have to be shy. ~ I'm taking my journey to Narayama as soon as the new year comes. ~ Parting with his mother is difficult for the son ~ Mama, aren't you cold? ~ The winter wind makes a flute-like noise as he struggles with his sorrow ~ Mama, the moon has disappeared behind the clouds. ~ Near Narayama ~ ~ The cry of the wind grows louder ~ Mama, it's getting chillier. It might start snowing. Mama, won't you say something? We haven't entered Narayama yet. It wouldn't hurt you to speak. Mama, this must be the place called the Valley of the Seven Turns. From here, it shouldn't be very far to Narayama. Mama! Please say something! A single word, at least! We'll enter Narayama beyond this point. Mama, say a single word at least! Please! You're hurting me! Have mercy. I beg you, don't do this! You'd kill your own father? Mata! You bastard! Idiot! Mama! Mama! Mama! The snow has started falling! Mama. Mama! You must be cold. Mama! You're lucky that it started snowing on the day you came here. Mama! It's really snowing just as you said it would. Mama. ~ In a corner in the back room ~ ~ My granny found herself a set of 33 demon teeth ~ ~ Look outside, Father The trees are all bare of leaves ~ ~ Carry a wooden frame on your back It's time for you to go ~ ~ Otori of the salt house is in luck for snowfall has come ~ ~ On the day of her journey to Narayama ~ ~ Even though it's very cold ~ ~ She can't wear a padded overcoat to go to Narayama ~ ~ Abandon granny in the back mountain ~ ~ Crabs come crawling from the back mountain ~ When we turn 70, we'll go together to Narayama. OBASUTE "Abandonment of Old People" THE END
