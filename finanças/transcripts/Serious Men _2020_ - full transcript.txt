The umbrella of night Has so many holes Who poured acid on it Is an unsolved mystery... I love this song. I don't know why. But I don't know what it means. And such songs suit every situation. Life is so fucking complex. We're born and we die, without knowing what any of it means. Like my grandfather who died on a train. On his way back to his village, he unknowingly boarded the first-class compartment. Someone jokingly questioned him, "This compartment is only for Brahmins! What are you doing here?" He died of a heart attack. Now, what do you think all of this means? Nothing. Maybe that's why I like this song. After sex, Oja holds this pose for five minutes. Her aunt believes it increases our chances of conceiving. Oja and her aunt have never heard about gravity. But I have. Where I work, people research stupid stuff like "Why is gravity such a weak force?" And "Why isn't there enough lithium in the universe?" I work at the National Institute of Fundamental Research under renowned space scientist Dr. Arvind Acharya as his personal assistant. Hurry up, Ms. Oparna! The ministry will be here in two minutes. Ayyan, Amartya Sen never said this. You'll get into trouble for this. You said this. Someone should say this. My boss has been searching for alien life for a decade. Today is a big day for him. These people who wouldn't even shake your hand for free now stand like beggars before this minister. Hello, sir. Please come. Hello, sir. Welcome, sir. Common folk ask ministers for clean water and power. But these guys want funds. They address money as fund. So after millions down the drain, they can proclaim, "Man knows nothing." I'll be up for a Nobel Prize someday and the dumbfuck didn't even introduce me. Satish, one coffee. Mr. Tawde, our proposal is to send four sterilized containers into the upper stratosphere. -What do you mean by stratosphere? -It's a... It's a layer in the air from six to 45 kilometers above the earth. What's the point of this? We'll be collecting stratospheric air there. Definitely we'll find space microbes. In our hypothesis, the microbes are aliens... aliens are falling on Earth all the time. They come riding on... meteorites. Tawde didn't understand anything. He has the IQ of a housefly. There is no room for microbes in his tiny brain. He'll stare at Acharya for a while, scratch his head, and then shit out his "expert comments." Suppose we find aliens, and they attack us. It's too big of a risk. -Yes sir... I've seen it in films. -Stay away. Yes, even I've heard they have two heads and three eyes and four legs-- No, sir. We are talking about microscopic aliens. Microscopic means really small. Tiny. Yes, I know microscopic means tiny. Even then there's a risk of attack. If they attack us, then? Look how viruses are killing so many people. -Mani! -Tell me sir. Go get ready for the presentation of the microbes mission. Which one, sir? The PPT or the video? How many times have I told you not to talk to me in Tamil? Go! Mr. Acharya, whatever you're doing… Ignore the prick. You know why he gave Ms. Oparna a lab in the basement? -No clue. -To develop a chemistry. Then he'll work on their physics, and they'll create their own gravitational force. Why does he get so furious when you speak in Tamil? Because my Tamil isn't great. Dad brought me here, to Bombay, straight after school. and even my wife's a Bombay-Tamilian. Dude, where's my tea? Please come, sir. Dr. Nambodari is also researching in the same field, but his approach is different. Please tell him, Dr. Nambodari. Sir, please sit. I would say the best way to look for aliens is our radio telescope. My "Giant Ear" program. But we can discuss that another day. Right now we are here to support Dr. Acharya. Right, Arvind? -How's my fake enthusiasm? -You pube. Oparna, switch on the AV, please. The Balloon Program will retrieve microscopic samples from the stratosphere. Life forms cannot exist at this altitude. That's why... Shut the door, you moron! Sorry, sir. Moron. Imbecile. Knobhead. These were the names our bosses called us. So, to return the favor, we called them "Serious men." Idiot! The microscopic samples will be studied in our specially designed class 1000 lab. The most important part of this balloon apparatus is... Let's say we find this alien... Then what? How does it matter? We will finally be able to know who gave birth to us. Lord Brahma. Lord Brahma is our creator. Our scriptures prove it. -Look. He's about to jump. -What? Where? Go and save him! If you spook him, he will jump. -You know who that is? -Who? That's a "serious man." See these cars speeding along? He probably rides around in one of those, furiously working on pathbreaking... presentations about horseshit like "Should condoms be dotted?" He can't figure out "what life means" so he's come here to jump. -Aren't you gonna eat that? -Stop kidding me! I'm kidding you? Every night you crave snacks. So? Can't you get them? Don't you love me? How much more am I supposed to love you? If this guy loved his wife as much, you know what she'd say? -I love you too. -No. She'll say, "I need some space. You're stifling me!" -Oh look, he's jumped! -Huh? -He jumped. -Hey! There he goes. Look... if you don't jump in the first 30 seconds, then you can't jump at all. And how do you know that? I tried a couple of times after our wedding. -How's the tea? -Disgusting! No matter what I do for you, you're never happy! Come, I'll take you to an amazing place. -I was just kidding! -You always do that. You set yourself up. -You know what we're doing? -What are you doing? We're spending quality time together! It's me time and you time! Quality time! A hot air balloon will go to the upper stratosphere -to look for aliens. -Excuse me. Microscopic aliens, understand? They come down all the time on the earth. -My wife is pregnant. Make it quick! -Sure, sir. Relax, be comfortable. Excuse me, sir. This area is actually reserved for our in-house guests only. Are you staying with us? Yes. 602. Would you like to have something? -One tea for ma'am. -And for you? Beer. Not extremely chilled, not warm. Okay, sir. I'll bring it to you. Thank you. 1200 bucks for tea! -No way I'm drinking this. -You're 2G after all... second generation. We 2G folks can never enjoy ourselves. -And who are these people? -4G. -As in? -Fourth generation. My father was first generation. Never went to school. I'm second generation. I went to school and studied too. But only later did I realize how important education is. I'll send my kid to one of the best schools. Drill the importance of education into him. He'll become successful and be able to make presentations on "Why condoms should be dotted!" That's the third generation. By the time his kids are adults, they'll have everything. They won't have to work at all. They can just sit by a pool and do nothing all day. Oja, it takes four generations to be able to do nothing at all. Excuse me, sir. Sir. Sir, we have noticed that we have another guest in room number 602. No, I said 702. No, sir, you... you had said 602. I heard you. -I said 702. -Are you sure you are staying with us? I said 702, man! Sir, 602. But-- What's wrong? Sir, something is wrong. -What happened? -Good move. Now scream a little louder. I'm not faking it! -Please, someone call a taxi! -Sir... -Sir, you... -We have a problem. Call a cab. Yes, right away. -Doctor! I need a doctor. -Yes, sir. -Call now. -Don't worry, Oja. Please hold this end. Yes, sure. You pube... You bloody dog... You asshole... -You pube... -Take a deep breath. Stupid bastard... Why is she saying that? It's the Lord's name in Tamil. -Pube. -Take a deep breath. I'm Tamilian, too, brother. Pubic hair... Fuck you! It's a tradition in our village that when a woman goes into labor, they get to swear, though only at their husbands. It's a tradition... but only to the husband! Try! Push! You son of a whore... -Fuck your mother! -Relax. -Breathe! -Pube! Push! Breathe! Push! Push down! Breathe! We're done! Relax! Dear Acharya sir, Subject: Application for paternity leave. Myself, Ayyan Mani, your PA, is pleased to inform you... my contemporary Oja Mani delivered a bright young boy yesterday. Just like a budding seed needs nurturing to become a flower, a newborn human also needs... A newborn human also needs to be... ...subjugated to intense caring and extreme love, to become a wonderful and responsible Homo sapien. Just like you, sir. For us, our kids are our only hope. So I have to make sure he gets the best care and hospitality. My wife Oja would require... humongous nutrition and ample rest so that our child can feed off her. As the man of the house, I will have to take over the essential household chores and support my family in abundance. Hence, I would like to apply for paternity leave of two months. Therefore grant leave to me kindly. Yours sincerely, Ayyan Mani. This is your corner. You will study here. It's dark, but you can light it up with your talent. Come! Come to Daddy. -A proper English medium school? -Yes! Even the janitors speak English. There's a 500 buck fine for speaking in Hindi. Hey! It's your boss! There's even a lab here named after him. We have his recommendation. Don't worry. Don't I have the same tie? Can you tell me the name of any color? Red? Blue? Yeah? Or how about you tell me the name of these fruits? Okay, Adi! Let's try something else. Tell me the days of the week. Adi is a little shy. He's an introvert. Like Einstein. Even Einstein couldn't talk until he was six. Mr. Mani, thank you so much for your application. Please go and submit the form at the admission's office. Ayyan Mani. -What kind of people are Manis? -What kind? The good kind. Why? No, like, what... Where are they from? Oh, that way. We're Shudras. Lower caste. Do I tell you? -Sir, we-- -Hey! What are you saying? You can't utter that word! Oh, no, you can't utter it. But I can. Let me explain. You can't call an African-American a "Negro," but they can call each other. Negro means what? It's Latin for "black." Black is just a color. Anyone can be black. Even you. -But when did I say this? -No! No, I'm not talking about you. I'm just saying. My ancestors did hard labor all day. Cleaning the village's piss and shit with their bare hands. It was honest work, but you people turned it into a slur. Take my wife's caste... the Guthakami people. The privileged castes don't allow their men inside the village, but they want their women in their bedrooms at night. Hey, what are you saying? Brother, caste is a thing of the past, isn't it? Before you, someone from a different caste sat on this chair. -So I can't say that caste-- -You just said this. -But you just did! Right now. -Sir. Sir, calm down. Have a seat. A couple of sips. That's all my grandfather drank from the village well. They broke his spine. He walked like this for the rest of his life. It had a bad impact on his spinal cord. Enough! -Here, please have some water. -No sir, I had. No sir, I've had coconut water. Sir, I... Dr. Acharya, he is my colleague. He has recommended me. -Oh, Dr. Acharya! -Yes. We are proud to say that he is our alumnus. You just wait outside. We'll soon put up the list of shortlisted candidates. Okay, sir. Hello, Dr. Acharya? Yes, ma'am. I spoke with Dr. Acharya. He said "yes" just to get Mani off his back. He said, "Admissions should happen strictly on merit." What happened? Nothing. Show me. One minute. All parents are requested to pay attention. The admission formalities for this year are now over. The shortlisted candidates are requested to stay back. God bless you all, and thank you for coming. You know what? Caste-based reservations should stop. Merit is everything. Dr. Acharya, you are betting big on this. What makes you so sure that alien microbes are falling on us? You seem to know something that we don't. Tell me, if I offer you a glass of water and a pill which has got all the elements of water, would you go for this odorless, tasteless, colorless liquid, or the pill? Water will still be what your primitive mind chooses. I am sorry, I didn't understand. If you understood, you would be me. Adi! What's so interesting outside? Adi, I'm talking to you! Ma'am, I was looking at photosynthesis. I was wondering, why can't we insert green pigment chlorophyll in humans and synthesize nutrients from CO2 and water. That way, we can generate oxygen as a by-product and save Earth. What are your thoughts on this, ma'am? Direct your science queries to Mr. Rangaraj! Okay? Right now, get up there and solve this. Ma'am, I have a math query too. Where A is the field value of [NxN] / N cross N complex matrix-- Shut up and go back to your seat! It's okay, ma'am. Even I cannot solve it. I can't believe you just said that to me. That is ridiculous! Is this the way you talk to your teacher? I am going to complain to the principal about you. This is what happens when you come from illiterate parents. It shows your upbringing! I cannot tolerate this nonsense anymore. I'm going to talk with the principal right now. I will get you expelled from the school. I hadn't prepared for the test. You saved me! Thank you. Adi is not rude, Sister. Adi is not rude. Go outside, dear. His IQ is 169. He's far too advanced for your rote learning syllabus. -He's on another level. -Yes, Mr. Mani. Jesus has given Adi a great mind. Praise the Lord! He's Goddess Meenakshi's blessing. I even trekked barefoot to Lord Ganesha's temple when I was pregnant. Do you believe in Christ, Mr. Mani? I love Christ. Christ loves you too, Mr. Mani. But if you and Adi accept him formally, then as per the policy of the school for financially backward Christians, Adi could get a special scholarship. In fact, I could promote him directly to the 9th standard. Obviously, there is no compulsion. We never compel. You can check with your friend, Mr. Satish Macwana, Sayali's father. You can check how much benefit Sayali has got ever since his family accepted Christ. If you don't mind me being so bold, I must tell you, I really feel for the people of your community, Mr. Mani. Mr. Acharya is a respected and senior member of the community, but he's a Brahmin. And don't mind me saying, but he never provided a written recommendation for your son. -Excuse me? -I will call you in five minutes. Okay, ma'am. I'll think about it. One minute. Have you seen this? Ever since Adi won Switzerland's Omega Science quiz... See... -The Vivekanand school-- -Ridiculous! What an attitude! See this! The Vivekanand school's people have been hounding us. Four interviews in the past three months. Right? Okay. They're even offering free admission, books... No, Mr. Mani. Don't fall for that trap. We will give you free books, and we will add on free transport! They're also offering a scholarship. And they don't care if we worship Ganesha or Christ. I thought of you while considering their offer. A long time ago, you rejected Adi's admission. But then two years ago, you voluntarily offered him admission because of his "merit." It just shows how much you care about Adi. I'm sorry. We have to go. I've so many meetings. Come. Mr. Mani... I'm not going to let you take away my star student. Don't even think about it. -We'll provide everything that Adi needs. -Come, Adi. Okay, Sister. As you wish. -Come on. -Let's go, Adi. Don't make him like yourself. God has given you a gift. No need to be arrogant about it. Be polite to everyone. Arrogance is for the devil. What? Who's the devil? Be humble, and bow politely. Got it? And why should he bow? So that the world can screw him over? Hello. Mic check, 123... Why is the press here? Did someone get stabbed again? Go see if Adi's makeup is done! Do I have to tell you everything? Go quickly and check. -Excuse me, sir... Can you please... -Later on. Can I have a moment? Yes, sir... Fifteen percent of your funds! That's all I ask for! We are getting requests from radio astronomers all around the world for my "Giant Ear" program. I'm not spending research funds on stupid ideas. They've been sitting on your radio telescope for 25 years. How many aliens have they found, by the way? Universe is vast, Arvind. Even light takes time. Your radio signals are not searching for aliens. It is searching for beings who think, act and maybe shit like humans. You call this science? I call it loneliness. Sir, I told you I need to go early today. There's a TV interview-- Out! How do you put up with this lunatic? Sir, it's a big day for my kid. Please convince him. Can I borrow your PA for a while at least? This is Mumbai's BDD chawl-A tenement built in 1920 to provide shelter to the homeless... I've been here for 60 years. Why don't they ask me about the chawl's history? They want to talk about the future, not history. The British turned it into a jail for freedom fighters. After independence, it became a settlement for the poor, with hopes that their fortunes will change with time. But Mumbai's glittering lights never reached these dark corridors. All they got were hollow promises. Today, 15,000 people stay in these 121 blocks. Adi is a ray of hope for them. Let's meet Adi, but after this short break. -Hey, hold it! -Yes! Why are you moving? Sit properly! -Put some more makeup on. Adi! -Mom! -Look here! -What's all this? What's going on? Madam, one second. What have you done to him? He looks white as an egg! -What is this? -Let them put it on. He'll look fair. Fair, why? Is he a white kid? He's our kid. -Adi! Wash your face! -No! Adi! Don't get lost in this skin-tone crap. Talent knows no color. Do it properly! Don't be scared. Okay? Move! Move aside. Move! Move aside. Vacate the room. Come on, sir. Please step outside. Adi, what do you love about science? And since when? You see, science helps us to understand things from atoms to the infinite universe. It expands our mind. And that is why, as organisms, we feel fulfillment when we go on the quest of answers. Excellent! That's why people call you Junior Abdul Kalam. What do you plan to research on? The future is very unpredictable. Constantly evolving by decisions we are taking in the present. But someday I want to solve the arrow of time. The cosmological arrow, idiot! The direction in which the universe is expanding. Adi, we're all idiots in front of you, but my question is-- Can I give you advice? If you don't have a smart thing to ask, don't ask at all! -And with that, our... -Well said, Adi! Superb! -Look, it's Adi! -Yes! -Adi! -What do you want? We live in block 120. We want a selfie with Adi. Yes. One minute, come. -I'll click it. -Take it. -Nice. -Come on, smile. Adi, smile, please! What's a broker doing running a tea stall? My brother is not well. Did you get it? Tell me one thing. People buy question papers for engineering and medical school exams. The fuck you want school exam papers for? -I'm writing a thesis on child education. -How will exam papers help? If you understood, you would be me. Tell your brother to move the stall away from the tracks. -Why? -Noise pollution, magnetic fields... It'll drive you crazy, dumbass! Why is this character always crying? Doesn't she get any dialogue? Where's Adi? I sent Adi to sort out our bills. The grocery store is always ripping us off. I'll talk to you later. Let me finish some work. Adi? Here are my income tax filings. Think you can save me some money? Tell me! Do you know a day on Venus is longer than a year on Earth? So people there file their returns every day?! And atmospheric pressure on Venus is 92 times greater than the Earth. Adi, please focus. Can you do something about my tax? Please? I don't have time for this. -Adi! -Nothing, Ayyan! I was just showing him my tax returns. But he seems to be stuck on Venus. Because he charges a consultation fee. -Please send five kgs of brown rice home. -Okay. Let's go. That was close! But never be scared. Say any damn thing and walk off. -Never go quiet. Geniuses never go quiet. -Why? Because they have answers to everything. -Why? -Because they are geniuses. If people don't understand what you're saying, they respect you. They don't understand a word of what you say. Even I don't understand. It's our secret! If you're ever stuck like this again, shout at them in anger and say... "I can't deal with primitive minds like you." -I can't deal with... -Primitive minds like you. Primitive minds... -Like you. -Like you. Very good. When you see the teacher tomorrow, ask her... Hey, Adi! Ask her... -Miss, genetic mutation... -Miss, genetic mutation... -...of space microbes... -...of space microbes... -...causes... -...causes... -...what kind of danger... -...what kind of danger... -...to us? -...to us? I got the papers. Just learn them. What are you doing? It's tilted. No worries madam. Fixing it. Looks all right to me. It's your face. Or do you want to put Adi's face instead? Dad, we've had this discussion. But we never finished it. Look, Anuja, you're the face of our political party. -People need to know you-- -Know me. They will know me, Dad, because of the work I do. Now, please let me work. Asshole! Put it down you motherfucker. I said the hoarding is tilted! Can't do a thing right. Sachin. He is Sachin, the great cricketer. Tell me why Sachin features in advertisements for cars? -For money, what else? -No, man... not like that. Why do car companies want Sachin for their advertisements? He's not a mechanic, is he? Nor is he an engineer. And yet... Anuja, you explain. She's good at all this. She did her MBA abroad. -In our community... -He means to say that I am the first from our community to study at Carnegie Mellon. See, the name Sachin, it represents excellence. Meaning... excellence. I know English. You can speak in English confidently. Okay. Yes, of course. Sachin isn't the world's best driver or engineer. But he is the face. Because people trust him. Just like Adi. -He knows nothing about politics. -Yet I see Dr. Ambedkar in him. I see Dr. Ambedkar in him. So is Einstein! It's a deadly combination. Namaste Keshav sir. We are about to begin Lord Ganesha's welcome prayer. I'll come. You go ahead. Ayyan has designed this year's Ganesha idol. Really? Great! -Let's go. -I'll be there in a jiffy. -Long live... -Keshav! -Long live... -Keshav! Hail to Lord Ganesha! Adi is becoming popular. Even politicians are at our door. It's good for Adi, but... inside I'm feeling a strange vibration. Maybe that's how Grandpa felt in that first-class compartment. Hail to Lord Ganesha! Hail to Lord Ganesha! What? What the hell is this?! Statue of Liberty. What is this blasphemy? -It's an insult to Lord Ganesha! -Who said it's an insult? It's a mark of respect. See it properly. It's made in the image of the warrior queen Lakshmibai. It's an ode to women, country, and the Gods all together. Have you seen pictures of Lakshmibai? Charging with a sword in her hand? I replaced it with a torch. Now stop crying blasphemy. He's got a mace in his other hand. When he goes to America, they'll hail him as Global Ganesha. -Hail to... -Lord Ganesha! -Hail to... -Lord Ganesha! -Hail to... -Lord Ganesha! I'm downstairs. I can see your car. Get in! This redevelopment project will cost 160 billion rupees. The government's cleared it. The builders are on board. I wanted to meet you before Dad does, because politicians have a money-minded image that we have an ulterior motive. I want to change that. I hold a lot of love for people in this community. See, redevelopment of these tenements into skyscrapers is inevitable. But will it do justice to the residents? How do we guarantee that? Bikini-clad models serving champagne in rooftop Jacuzzis... That's a bullshit I don't buy. And neither am I selling it to you folks. There'll be bigger-- Where is that motherfucker? Find him before the cops do. He tortured my daughter for a whole year! -Dad! -His brother lives in Pune. -Dad-- -Gag the fucker and bring him to me. I'll see what to do with him. Like I was saying... -Two huge rooms, proper ventilation. -You got hurt? No, she got married. Clean water supply, two schools, and a hospital for the colony. That's my vision. Wait, I don't understand this. I'm confused. What do you want from me? The government has approved the project, but the residents haven't. People don't trust politicians nowadays. But what if one of their own talks to them? I don't even own a house there. We'll make sure you own one. Yes, I mean... we don't believe in free labor. You'll get your due. Sir, do you think... the residents will listen to me? I'm a very small molecule of this society. Maybe not you, but they'll certainly listen to Adi. Move a little bit to your left. Yeah. Look up. ADI, 100% PURE DALIT Beautiful, Adi! We're not here to make empty promises. We're here to win your trust. We're here to talk about our politician? No! To talk about the future, we need to talk about this. And that's why none of our leaders will speak today, and yet our promises will reach you. -Long live... -Keshav! -Where's Ayyan? -He didn't come. I think he's nervous about Adi. Our guest of honor for today... might become the first Indian to colonize the Moon or explore Mars. Let's welcome to the stage Mumbai's real superhero... Our very own Adi Mani! -Cool sneakers, right? -Yes! -Do you want them? -Yes! -Then learn that speech by heart. -Sure? Adi! You see, our universe has many phenomena that we are unaware of. Didn't understand? Okay. I'll say it in Hindi. Take chocolates, for example. All we know is chocolates are bad for our teeth. But you're unaware that the chocolate you're relishing... ...is made from the blood of children who slave day and night. Give emphasis on "slave." Say, "Who slave day and night." Who slave day and night. Chocolate is made from cocoa beans. Two lakh children work in cocoa farms. About 7,000 of them have to die every year. So you can enjoy your chocolate! You must be feeling bad for those kids, but there's no way you can help them. If you want to help, help yourselves... Help every child of this tenement. How long should we live in this dump? We've gotten used to this filth. So we don't think about change. -Adi! -Papa! -Adi! -Papa! How'd you-- From now on, I'll whisper in your ears. This Bluetooth is for safety. But don't get used to it. There's only one way out of this darkness... There's only one way out of this darkness... -Redevelopment. -Redevelopment. Redevelopment will brighten the future of every child here. Not just skyscrapers, the foundations of our dreams will be built here. Swagger will replace shame when we chant, "We are the residents of the New BDD Complex!" If this kid steps into politics, he'll kill it. Now let's take a peek inside our tiny Einstein's massive super-computer of a brain! Ask him any math question! What's 786 + 3378? -4164. -4164. -Right answer! -Great, Adi! You're a computer! Next? Adi, what's 1257 x 386? Four lakhs, eighty-five thousand... Four lakhs, eighty-five thousand... -...two hundred and two. -...two hundred and two. Correct! Right again! Adi! I'm thankful to all the residents of BDD chawl. Because this project cannot succeed without your support. -Long Live... -Keshav! Everyone here has signed the sheet except Shinde. He isn't listening to us. Come with us Ayyan. I'll talk to Shinde. We need two more posters. Why are they not here yet? I'll get him alcohol. He'll sign for sure. Okay, good. So the plan is to construct a temple over there. The temple will belong to a God who brings us dignity. The Goddess of English! I've even composed a hymn in her praise! Very nice. A, B, C, D, E Oh Goddess of English Praise be to thee A, B, C, D, E Oh look, Obama is following you. But isn't Trump the American president? Trump following you isn't good. He has orange hair. That's never good. How many views? -200. -And followers? 5,000, but it's rising fast. -And Shah Rukh Khan? -Don't get ahead of yourself. Adi! Adi, do you know outdoor activities sharpen your brain? And increase the flow of oxygen. Go ahead, get some. Oxygen? What a genius kid! Bless you. You know? When I saw Adi on stage, I couldn't believe our luck. It felt so unreal, -I got scared. -Hey! What's scary about it? -It's scary because it's too good. -Stamp that fear out! You know, even for all these rich people driving around... there comes a moment... when everything starts to change. Is our life changing or my bra? -Can't I get you a new bra? -Here, I already have. No, it's the wrong size. Eighty-five percent of women in the world spend their lives in a wrong-sized bra. I'm sure you measured? How dare you hide your progress report? If you're so clever, why do you keep failing? Let it be. I'm working in houses. I work my ass off all day, and you don't even bother to study? Stop sending her to school then. Let her sit at home. Is that what you want? To sit at home all day? Oh look, here comes Einstein. What's your score out of 50? Fifty. Have some shame! You play with him all day. Go home! Why did you lie to me? I swear on Mother Mary, I'll never do it again. Get out of the house! Sleep outside tonight! She is so dark-skinned! -Wow! Is that an artificial tan? -No, it isn't. She charges a fortune for a ramp walk. You know that too! Everyone knows. She is very popular. She follows Adi on Instagram. Papa! Sayali's mom beat her badly. And threw her out of the house. Sayali will manage. Is your brain sharp yet? Learn the Fibonacci series now! Why are you here? Sayali! There are rats here. They'll bite you. What do you care? I'm here because of you. Sayali! Tell your mother you'll get 40 out of 50 next time. If not, should she beat you instead of me? -Just tell her. -I can't understand things like you can. -I can't either. -Sure. Am I the genius here? Even teachers are scared of you. What do you say? Photo... Photosynthesis. It's a chemical reaction. How do you know this? Dad makes me memorize it. I don't understand any of it. Then how come you always ace the tests? Or does your dad get those grades for you? Does he? -He brings it for me. -What does he get? Question papers. You're saying this to make me feel better? No, I'm a fool. I swear! I'll get you the question papers for the next exam. But this is our secret between Dad and me. Please, don't tell anyone! I beg you. Please! Promise? Sayali! Come on, your mother is calling. Sayali! Sayali! Sayali! Dad, I'll score 40 out of 50 next time. Let it be, idiot! Watch the stove. I'll be right back. Papa! What's up? Our secret... we can share it with our best friends, right? You didn't tell anyone, did you? Be honest. Did you? Adi, do you know... who my best friend is? Your mother! Your mother is the dearest friend that I have. And I didn't even tell her. Can you imagine... how special our secret must be? Understood? No matter who it is, we never share our secret. What? You got fooled last night. I was kidding. I actually am the genius, you know. Really? What's 137 x 89? Tell me. All right, what's 137 + 345? It's easy. I can't deal with primitive minds like you. Oh yeah? We'll find out in class today. -I'll give you the question papers. -When? A week before the exams. But you promised me. You can't tell anyone. All right. Attention, everyone! Whoever recites the most multiplication tables will get candy from all of us. All right! Okay! Adi, why don't you start? Hey, that's way too easy for him. It's not fair. Where are you off to? Oh, come on! I was just kidding. The dreams of our great leader Dr. Ambedkar will be fulfilled by us. By our Bahujan community. That day is not so far. And today we move closer to fulfilling our dreams by honoring 20 talented children from oppressed castes. It's a very good thing that these children will honor... Smile, Adi! The state is honoring you. There's nothing new to memorize today. Smile! Big smile! I shared our secret with Sayali. I'm sorry. -Adi! -Adi! All the best! -Adi, do you remember everything? -We'll join you. Adi is going to receive this prize. Come on! You know, Sayali, there are two kinds of people in the world. Smart ones and slow ones. -You're talking about Adi, right? -No, I'm talking about your father. I'm smart, he's slow. That's why he's my junior at the institute. Do you know Uncle Bob who lives on the ground floor? He gets drunk every day and beats his wife and kid. The kid was beaten with a belt last week. She was hospitalized. Do you know why he's like that? Because he lost his job. Do you want your father to beat you up like Uncle Bob? Because smart people like me can get him fired very easily. Smart people can do this easily. He's just a clerk. He is a bottom-rung idiot. You understand? He's nothing but a microbe to me. I won't tell anyone. I swear. Have it! It's for you. Go. The umbrella of night has so many holes Who poured acid on it Is an unsolved mystery... Come on, get ready! Adi has been invited on the TV show Wonderkid. Why did they call you? Because you never pick up. Can't they call me? I'm Adi's mother after all. Let's go. Mom! This milkshake is poison. There is so much sugar! Go get a new one. Adi, I'm telling you. If you ever talk to me that way, I'll whack you. -It's burger time. -Yes, Papa! Have it. Eat it, come on! Very good! Dad, I want to be on stage. -Why can't he be on the show? -I said no. That's final. This is a mockery of talent. I didn't do all this to parade Adi around like a circus animal. -What did you do? -I meant Adi. Adi's talent is not for sale. He's a true genius. WT confirm weather update. Wind speed is 12 knots and direction is 25 degrees. Copy. Current balloon altitude, 15 km above sea level. Eight degrees change at payload recovery point... Yes, I am coming in a minute! Wait! -Did you do it? -Yes, but this is a fraud! There are no space microbes. What if somebody finds out? You can ask for more time. I'm sure the Ministry will understand. The samples of former balloon missions have been inconclusive. We hope this mission will answer the question, are we alone in the universe? This is Rakesh Sharma with cameraman Raj reporting for Star News. What's up? The bulldog's gone berserk. Wants coconut water at this hour. How's Sayali doing in school? All good? Why are you asking about her? I think the balloon has gone bust. We'll be here all night. See you. They are a bunch of morons. They will shut us down. Just do what I said. I have already done it. It's in the mail. Yes. -Go get Ayyan. -Okay, sir. -What happened to the printer? -Why don't you try talking to them? Bulldog has asked for you. Yes, sir? No fucking printer works here! Go get the prints! -Which prints, sir? -I am mailing it to you now. Go! Go! Just try and understand! At least once! Bear with me. Why would I? You are not going to leave your wife. Together we will make history. For these Newton's bastards, we were like gravity... Invisible. Even if we danced around naked, they would barely notice us. Acharya thought that a small man like me couldn't see through his fraud. His arrogance makes him forget that IQ and social status are not linked. He once jeopardized Adi's future. And today fate gives me a chance to return the favor. Excuse me, sir. Yes, Mani? Now what's the problem? Sir, scientists can unravel the secrets of the universe. But they can't take a printout on their own. Why is that? Sample test results. But not from the lab, from Oparna's email. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. Today is a big day for the institute, and Dr. Acharya is present himself to make the announcement. Please give him a big hand. -Where are Nambodari and Udayan? -No idea, sir. Okay. Okay, let's dispense with the formalities and come straight to the point. Three minutes 23 seconds after the capsule reached its target in the stratosphere... it collected samples and returned safely. Analyzing the samples, I am proud to announce that India has found alien microbes. We cannot correct these simple things but aspire to colonize the space. -Excuse me, sir. -Yeah? Dr. Udayan has asked to cancel this press conference. Who is he to cancel this? These are orders of Home Ministry. -Ministry? -Yeah. -What's happening? -I told you something will happen. Just cancel the whole thing. Unfortunately, we have to call this off. Something urgent has come up. Nothing to say about this. We will reschedule and talk about this again. Dr. Nambodari and his team have made a thorough inspection of the capsule samples. Nothing. Shame on you! Exo-microbes are up there. You need to send more balloons, as many as needed, because that's where answers of our existence lie! The answer to the most profound question mankind has ever asked! Are we alone in the universe? You morons, you don't have patience for the truth. You want to cut all my-- I suggest you shut up, Dr. Acharya. What you have committed is fraud. And this institute could have lost its prestige, had your fraud been exposed. I don't want the press to come to know about this. You will resign, citing personal reasons, within the month. Or is it too much to expect a shred of dignity from you? This evening you will release a statement saying that the capsules were damaged during reentry, and the samples have been contaminated. Got it? According to chaos theory and the butterfly effect, a kid pissing in BDD chawl can cause a tsunami in Japan. Horseshit theory! I got Acharya fired which made him available to attend Adi's school event. You know about the chief guest, don't you? Two geniuses always end up meeting! Now this butterfly effect will bring a tsunami in my life. So... what's your dream, young man? What do you want to do? A neutron star spins 600 times per second. I want to see how we can harness its energy. Given its mass ratio, crushed atomic nuclei and speed-up process, don't you think this is beyond our abilities? After quantum bounce, black hole transforms into white hole. Newton states that in his fifth law of motion, right? Right. Are you sure? I can't deal with primitive minds like you! We were discussing science. My father teaches me everything. Yes, of course. I can sense that. Adi, give us a moment. So... I was just listening to your son talking nonsense. Fifth law of motion? When did Newton discover that? Sir, please don't tell anyone. It'll ruin Adi's future. Don't give excuses. What you are doing is fraud. It is immoral and unethical. Didn't you do the same thing for your balloon mission, sir? Don't you dare compare my sacrifices with your fraud! Sir, I am begging you. I'm sorry, sir. Why? Why should I shut my mouth? For the sake of science, sir. I can get you your job back at the institute. So? Marriages end. Come, Ayyan. But in this case, it's domestic violence. I filed a case. Stay out of my personal life, if you want to keep the account. -Tell Madhav I'm using his cabin. -Yes, ma'am. And Poornima, next time no "Dalit woman victim card" shit for me, please. When were you going to tell me about the documents? After I asked you? Give me all the details. Go to the room and ask them to wait. These papers are cleared, have them delivered. And send me the Malad land files. -I thought this was about Adi. -I'm talking about Adi. Dr. Acharya is a big influence on Adi. I understand that. But even if Dad pulls some strings, I can't promise anything. Anuja, people are concerned about places of worship. No one gives a damn about research institutes. It's important to get Dr. Acharya his job back. Please try. Dad? Are you still in touch with the Science and Technology Minister? Hello, mom? Mom? There's some network problem here. What? Mom, there's a network issue. Falls on earth with metereo-- It's meteorites. -With meteorites. -And what does that mean? It's written here. Written? Don't you ever feel curious to ask? These unknown... diseases... are spreading... Cause of space microbes. -Their cure... -Their cure? What about their cure? Forgot? Don't you remember? What if the Bluetooth stops working on stage? Or if the call drops? I'm killing myself for your future! You can't learn a bloody speech! Learn it! Stop making faces! Write multiple times if you need to. Every word needs to be etched in your brain. Hey Adi, can you calculate the velocity and displacement of your head if this ball knocks it off? What's the formula for a megameter? Hey, Adi! I'm tired. Get me some chlorophyll. Tell me the equation for Pythagoras' theorem! Adi! -Adi, what's sinθ/cosθ? -Don't worry! Your father is smart. He'll handle everything. Answer your mom! Hey, Adi! What's the formula of gravity? And what's Newton's third law? Adi, we want the value of pi! -What is the value of pi? -He doesn't know. Go home, son. Adi! Adi! Adi! Space microbes are microorganisms... from another planet... er... galaxy. They fell... are falling... on Earth... every day. On meteorites, they fall on Earth. ...with meteorites. My research shows that... space microbes are responsible... for the life-threatening diseases... spreading in our city. Current medical science is unable to understand these diseases. Why are you not saying? Adi! Why are you not saying? Adi! Mom! Mom! Mom! -Mom! -Adi! Call the ambulance! -Adi! -What happened! Please call the ambulance. Ma'am, how's Adi? Sir! Excuse me, sir, just one question! How's Adi? Leave us alone! Just one question sir! An unwell Adi made an important statement today. Deadly diseases are being spread by space microbes. It's a matter of grave concern that the government is not taking this seriously. Recently, Dr. Arvind Acharya, a researcher on space microbes, has been fired from NIFR. Stay tuned for our special report tonight, The Space Microbes Armageddon. He's better. I'll call in sick today. Adi! Adi! Stop fooling me. I'm not going to fall for this, okay? Why didn't you learn the speech? I can't handle all this alone. I can't do this. Forget it. Let's stop all this. Okay. Let me announce that you're a normal kid and not some genius. Okay? All finished. Happy? No, Papa! I'll prepare! No, you won't. You'll just waste time. Go down and play with those useless kids... by the gutter. Hello? Hold on. Thank God Adi's fine. I was really worried. The schedule for the month is packed. That's why I've told you. We need to help Dr. Acharya. Adi is worried sick about him. I'll make it happen. Don't worry. We have the signatures. Tell me what's happening with the chawl. Oh, no! You say... So I was thinking, of course after Adi is fine... We should nominate him for the Guinness Book of World Records. As the youngest person ever to recite the first 1,000 prime numbers, or the first 500 digits of pi? It'll be great for PR. We've got a list of things Adi can do. My team has that list. I'll get it. Isha? Get me that list on Adi, please. Some kid speaks about space microbes, and the Ministry is going to put this fraud back in this chair? Ministry is only considering it. They have not put him back yet. Dr. Acharya, please finish the note that the medical reports are okay. Bullshit! I will expose everything if this man is allowed on the campus anymore. You will be exposed as well, for spying on me. What? How dare you level these allegations on me? I always respected you, Arvind. I didn't spy on you. It was your assistant, Ayyan Mani, who informed me of your fraud. People say geniuses have the wisdom to think before they act. Bollocks! Angry genius Acharya acted just like an ordinary Ayyan. He wrote a letter to Keshav spilling the beans on Adi. For once, Acharya focused more on something other than his balloon mission. So he could ruin my life. What the fuck is this? I told you... not to rely on them. Now he and his Sachin will take us down. You didn't even give a damn about Adi. They can both go to hell. 15,000 people have agreed on the redevelopment project. What about them? These are our people! I can't leave them homeless. -Sir, I was about to-- -Shut the fuck up! Who else knows about this? This letter guy... and your clown child... are your problems. Deal with them. Dad, that's enough! -For God's sake, he's a kid. -I should've never listened to you. You stay out of this! If their little fraud becomes public, the redevelopment project will look like a scam. The Home Minister is coming to this event to induct Anuja in their party. I want Adi there. And the paparazzi that follows him around, I want that too. If anything goes wrong at the event... anything at all... then you and your family... Get it? Out! Out! Look Anuja, if you have a problem with all this, you can step away. Go back abroad after my party merges. I'm not going anywhere, Dad. I have been offered the ticket, not you! What's this con you're playing? Passing off your idiot child as a genius and scamming the world? -What's this? -Question papers! Sayali had them. Two slaps and she spilled her guts! Now the whole world will... spit at you. -I'll strip both of you naked. -Motherfucker! Come here. What will you say? That my kid is not a genius? Fucking prick! That I'm running a scam? Who's going to listen to you? All of BDD chawl owes its new houses to Adi and me. I'm taking dumb fucks like you out of this hell, you son of a bitch. And if you're still itching to out me, don't forget! Keshav Dhawre is backing me, the former minister. Just one word and his men will hack you to pieces. Asshole! I've struggled with this filth since I was a kid. I decided long back that my son will rise above it. My son is a genius. Because his father isn't a dumb fuck like you. Asshole! Adi will have all those things... that our community has been deprived of. What got into you? You shouldn't have said such things. I'm sorry, man. What's wrong? What's wrong? Adi! Adi! -What happened? -Dad, I have memorized it. I remember it all. Please don't tell anyone. Space microbes are... existing... -Adi, forget it... -Space microbes. Relax! It's okay. Ayyan! Can you come? Bob is beating his wife again. Come... Causing diseases. Exist... Existing medical science is not ready for this. Space microbes... Chocolate made from cocoa beans. It kills thousands each year. So you can relish the taste. Photosynthesis... -Dad, I remember... -Adi, I'll stop this. -We'll not repeat it. -Dad, I remember. Green pigment chlorophyll... The atmospheric pressure on Venus is 92 times greater than the Earth. Adi, let's stop all this. Adi, please stop. It's all over. I promise. Never again. Atmospheric pressure on Venus is 92 times greater than the Earth. Adi! What are you doing? I told you, it's over. What's wrong? You go out. This is our secret! I am not sharing it with anyone. Go out! Which secret? Dad! What secret was Adi talking about? You better answer, or else... I wish you were dead! My uncle had planned... to marry me off to a pimp. Because he didn't ask for any dowry. But then you and your family came along agreeing to bear the cost of the wedding. So my uncle married me off to you. Today, I wish I had married that pimp instead. He would've been abusive, but at least he'd have been a better father. He wouldn't have sold his son off like you did. I did it all for Adi. Shut up. You did all this for yourself. You have issues with the world. Adi does not. And what did you accomplish? We're still in this rented pigeonhole. Lies upon lies upon lies. Adi! -Adi! -Adi! -Adi! -Adi! Black hole. The gravity in a black hole is so strong that even light can't escape it. Every giant star ends up a black hole, collapsing into itself. Nothing escapes. Dark times remind you of your darkest memories, the ones we can never forget. I understand, sir. Yeah. Can we meet once? I wouldn't have asked you if it wasn't important, sir. Please, sir. Watch him. He'll go somewhere. Far away from you, hopefully. Why the hell are we here? What did I say? Be patient. -Ayyan. -Sir. -Thanks for coming, sir. -Why have you called me? So you and that politician can threaten me? Sir, this is a letter from the Ministry giving you your job back. You're trying to bribe me? Sir, I can't do much for you, but I can do something. This isn't a deal. I don't want anything in return. Trust me, sir. Please sit, sir. There's another reason for calling you here. Do you see that photograph, sir? Global Earth Conference Photograph of the Year 1991 by Robert Addington. That's my village, Korathi. Who is she? My mother. My parents were farm laborers. My father was illiterate. But he knew labor can only earn you a livelihood, not a life. Lower castes weren't even allowed inside the school. Mr. Robert was here on an international assignment. Rumor was that... the woman whose photograph will be selected would get a prize of 10,000 rupees. So my father took my mother. And that boy? That's me, sir. Mr. Robert took a photo of my mother. But not this photo. So my father asked... what he thought of her photo. Mr. Robert casually said that she looked too healthy for a farm laborer. My father got scared. I don't know what he did, but my mother lost five kilograms in two weeks. He took her back to Mr. Robert and said, "Click her now!" Two months later in Copenhagen, that photograph won a prize of $200,000. Mr. Robert sent us 20 grand instead of 10 with a note that said, "It was not the photograph that was chosen by the world, it was her." Before my mother could learn that she was chosen by the world, she was dead. My brother was born premature, and he, too, died within a few hours. But after that, I never had to labor on a farm. Twenty grand was a lot of money for us. My... The price of my education... was the lives of my mother and brother. When I realized that Adi is a slow learner and might be expelled from school... I couldn't control myself, sir. Your angst is right, but your actions are not. Your son has replaced you in that photograph. I know, sir. I realize that my child has become the clown of my own circus. -Don't say that. -It's the truth. I never wanted Adi to be like me, sir. I always wanted him to be like sir. Didn't I? Kids are like flowers. Either they bloom... or die. But you have to keep watering the seeds. If you don't let him be, you will destroy him. But sir... Keshav won't listen. The bigger worry is your son, not Keshav. I will give you the exit strategy. The combined IQ in the station is literally in the stratosphere today. Boys and girls, we have Dr. Arvind Acharya and the wonder kid himself, Adi... Don't stare at me. Listen, it's about your son. -Good morning, Dr. Acharya. -Well, I'm happy. We have the government back on our side, and all because I have Adi on mine. My life's work is being funded by the grace of this young man now. That is outstanding. And Adi, before we begin, please tell us in a second -what is 102 x 223? -Please don't answer that, Adi. Science is not about gimmicks such as mental multiplications. He's a child, and all of us seem to have forgotten that. He needs to grow. He has lots to learn, and he will learn. He needs to play and have friends. Allow him his childhood, and I promise you he will change the world. I also urge Adi's father not to make him into an exhibition. I hope his father is listening. You know, Adi, in my career of 30 years, all I have seen is... -failure. -Failure? Yes! You know what the great thing about failure is? You learn. So it's okay if you fail. Adi, you wait here. I'm coming, okay? From the first day, Anuja believed in Adi's potential. Dad? -After meeting Adi, Anuja told me that... -Dad! ...Dad, from now onwards, Adi, who is living in Chawl, is our responsibility. -Once he's grown, he will make our future. -Dad! -But we have to make his present. -Dad! Adi is busy in his studies and research, but still he came here to become a part of this auspicious event. Let us all welcome Adi Mani! Adi! Adi, just speak your mind. You aren't bound by anyone anymore. Not even me! I don't know anything. Whatever I say... my father has taught me. I'm here only because of him. I don't know anything. What a humble child! Get down. Come. -I will pay you tomorrow. -Okay He passed in all subjects. Scored 55%. He's performing much better now. You should encourage him a bit. Nothing I say reaches him. If it comes from you, he'll work harder. Okay, I'm going to the shop. Why don't you help out with the shop? At least say something. Primitive minds... I can't deal with you. Dad, what we are going to buy with Aunty Anuja's money? Now the Creator will play his game The moon is the ball All the girls will be attentive calls throughout the city Now the Creator will play his game The moon is the ball All the girls will be attentive Calls throughout the city You can't mess with the game The whistle will blow anytime Blow it cautiously, or you'll be exposed Night is a black umbrella with many holes Who poured acid on it Remains a mystery We are thugs We mess with everyone We are thugs We mess with everyone But mess with Him with caution But mess with Him with caution Or you will have to pay for it Night is a black umbrella with many holes Who poured acid on it Remains a mystery
