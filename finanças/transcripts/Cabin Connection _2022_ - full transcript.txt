Hey. Thank you. Can you scan these over? Hey, what did she think? Walk with me. Oh no, she hated it. No, not at all. This is my first big article that isn't a "Which breakfast food are you?" quiz and I totally blew it. You did not blow it. But she didn't hate it, she just, she just thought it was a little one-sided. Well, it's an opinion piece. Yes and it was very well-written. I mean, everything you write is good. It's just a little cynical. - What? - Take the title for instance, "Marriage, is it compatible for the 21st century?" I mean, that question in itself already implies you think it's out of date. Okay, I mean, that's a good point. I will change the title. And it's not just the title. Oh boy. This is not an academic study. It's a lifestyle magazine. We want real stories, romance sells. Okay, fine, however, people who choose to stay single are worthy of having their opinions heard. I'm not trying to sell some fake image here. Real love, successful marriages, they do exist. Weren't your grandparents married for like 60 years? - Yes, but... - Ah, see? Look Hannah ever since you and Kyle broke up, you seem kinda down. Oh, come on that was two years ago and I'm the one who ended it. Yes, but every breakup is hard in its own way, especially when you were engaged. I just really don't think I'm letting it affect my work that much, but I get it, you need something different and it's my job to deliver so, consider it done. You are going to crush it. It's just the first draft, you can fix it. Yeah. Okay, yes, you're right. Oh shoot. What? Oh, I was supposed to meet my Nana's lawyer tonight, but, I can cancel it I'm going to work on the article. Absolutely not, go. We'll talk some more later. Thank you. Mr. Singh? Oh, hello. Hi, I'm Hannah Moore. Ah yes, the elusive Ms. Moore, please come in. - Have a seat. - Thank you. I'm not sure if you got my voicemails, but I'm the executor of your grandmother, Rosalyn Moore's will. Okay. Mrs. Moore was, a wonderful person. Yeah she was, thank you. And she clearly felt the same about you. She left everything in your name. What? Are you sure? Yes, not many cash assets, but she did have this, her cabin in Sherbrooke falls. Did you know about it? Yeah, um, I thought she sold this years ago when she moved to the city after my grandpa died. No she refused to, even when she probably could have used the money. She was adamant that you have it. Well, we just need a few signatures to make it all official. She also left you this. And here's the key to the cabin. Wow. I know. Have you read it? Um, no, no yet, I feel like I should save it for something. They're her last words. Oh, that's understandable. What about the cabin? Wasn't that the place they used to go to every summer when we were kids? Yeah, but I haven't been there in 10 years, between school and then work. They always came to me. Man, I loved it there. So what are you going to do? I dunno, sell it. Be a shame to let it sit empty. Well, why does it have to sit empty? Maybe you should go. No. This could be good for you. I can't, between work, the article. I've gotta submit it in two weeks. You can write it from there. Half our staff works remotely it's not a big deal. I'll clear it with the magazine. Really? I mean, you haven't even unpacked since her funeral. Go to Sherbrooke falls. Spend some time surrounded by Nana's stuff and rest, heal, write? You need a chance to process all of this. It does sound appealing. You know, you're basically my therapist now. And bestie and boss and workout partner. Just not lately. Go repack your bags and I'll order us some takeout. Okay, fine, but it's on me. Thai food or Chinese? Danny the store is on fire! Oh, ah... I told you not to track dirt into our store. Come on, gimme a break. Plus, as soon as we open, they're going to be like a dozen people trudging through here making the same mess. Mm yeah, well there is a mop right here with your name on it, so. - Fine. - Yes! Oh but first, we have that delivery to unload. Are you gonna give me a hand or am I gonna have to call dad out of retirement? No, no, no, no, don't do it because you know, he's just gonna backseat drive this place again. Messing the whole place up. - Right? - Yeah. Okay, come on. I'll make coffee while we're at it. Okay, that about does it for the dairy products. Hey, what is this? Oh yes! Aw, these are so cute. See, I thought these would be perfect for in front of the cash, you know great impulse buys. Or more like a bunch of dust collectors. Dust collectors, ah, you are such a downer. I'm just trying to balance the books. Yeah, well maybe if you'd let me update the website, we could actually attract some new customers. We don't need a new website. We are doing just fine as it is. But we haven't touched it in years, in the tech world that might as well be a century. We should get with the times cause I'd love even an online store. Okay easy now, let's start with the mugs. You can put them wherever you want, but please, no more website talk. Okay fine, but promise me we'll talk about it soon. Okay, I promise, but not today. But you know what you can do for me today? Call my friend Rachel. She's free this weekend. Danny. What? Rachel's amazing, she's a teacher, she's sociable, she's single. She sounds great. But? Oh, come on. I Know it's weird, but Olivia wouldn't want you going gray in that cabin by yourself. She'd want you to put yourself out there again. Danny stop, can we not speculate on what Olivia would've wanted. Please. It's okay to move on. I know and I'm good, honestly. Okay, okay fine. You got to check these out. Now what do you have in there? Matching hats or something? Ahh. I mean, they come for the food, - but they stay for the flare. - Yeah. Wow. Nana. Perfect. Hey there, do you need a hand? Um, yeah, do you have any of that stuff that they use to fill holes in the wall? Drywall paint? Yeah. - Right here. - Oh. You doing some renos? Yeah, sort of. Thanks for this. Do you have any sandpaper or a scraper? You're gonna need that if you're fixing holes or anything. Uh, yeah thank you. We paint here too, these are the selection these days. Thanks to the house flipping craze. I'm not flipping houses. Sorry I just couldn't help but notice that you were perusing the real estate section over there. Yeah well, I was just curious. Right of course. He's not giving you a hard time, is he? No it's fine. Perfect, so what brings you to Sherbrooke falls? I'm staying at my Nana's cabin for a couple of weeks, getting some work done. - Great who's your Nana? - Rosalyn Moore. Oh, I read her obituary in the paper the other day. I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you, did you know her well? In passing, you know, when you're one of the only stores in town you get on a first name basis with people pretty quickly. And Cole, actually, he um, he used to love her blueberry scones that she used to hand out to all of her neighbors. He tried them once and hasn't stopped talking about them since. She was an incredible baker. Well, if you decide to whip them up while you're here... I will let you know. Packed up, okay so did you get everything you need? Um some white paint. Yeah, sure. Hey Cole, why don't you grab her some paint? Eggshell finish work for you? Eggshell! Alright so all together we've got 53.40. Okay, perfect. That's fine. Thank you so much. You need a hand bringing the paint you don't need out to your car? No, thank you, I am fine. See you around. What's with the grin? Nothing. I forgot to ask you to bring back my roasting pan though. I left it in your place last Sunday night. And Aaron needs it for pot roast tonight. You want me to go get it right now? Yes, please? Fine but you still owe me a coffee. Yeah, it'll be ready when you get back. Okay. Thank you. Oh come on. Oh come on. What are you doing here? I live here. You live in that house? Yeah for the last five years. The real question is what are you doing breaking into Mrs. Moore's place? Well, I'm not breaking in, Mrs. Moore is my grandmother or was my grandmother. Oh, I'm sorry. You know what let's start over. I'm Hannah Moore. Cole Walker. Nice to meet you. Now I can either give you a little boost or I can help you with the front door if you'd like dealer's choice. Well the door would be nice. So you work at the store? I own it with my sister, Danielle. It used to belong to our parents, but they're retired now. That's nice. What do you do outside of not flipping houses? I work at a lifestyle magazine. Oh you're a writer. Oh, well, if you've ever taken a, 'which pasta noodle are you' quiz then yeah I probably wrote it, but I'm actually working on something new. It's my first big gig. That's awesome. Should we give it a whirl? Yes please go for it. Okay, well. Thank you very much for all your help today. - You're welcome. - Yes I'll see you around. I'll see you around. Thank you so much. And there you go, enjoy. I just sold another set of mugs now I don't want to say told you so but... Very funny. I had to seize the moment. How do you manage to turn every conversation into a setup? I don't know It's a gift. Don't you have anything better to do? Yeah I do. That's why you should be honored that I'm so focused on you. Well what did I say about meddling? Uh oh. What's she got you pulled into now? Nothing. - Because I won't bite. - Attaboy. But he should. I have some restocking to do. I'll see you later. You bet. Okay bye love you too. Hey, I know you guys have a special thing going on between the two of you. Maybe it's time you let it be. Is wanting him to be happy really such a bad thing? No, but maybe he should come to it on his own terms, you know? Okay yeah you're right. It does happen on occasion. Okay. You ready to go? Yeah, yeah I'm just going to close up here and I'll meet you outside. Sounds good. Hey, I love you. I love you too. It was so humiliating. I mean I was basically halfway through the window, which by the way, I was never going to fit through. That does sound like you. I know I mean, it was infuriating, especially after how smug he had been at the store. What do you mean by smug? He assumed I knew nothing about basic home repair. Well, to be fair you don't really. I have lived in New York city since I was 17. Yeah which means you're strong as an ox, but you're on the phone with the building manager anytime there's a problem. Now let's get to the most important part. Is he cute? No. - Is he married? - Why would you even ask that because I'm definitely not going to. Interview him for the article? Oh, well. - No, I would rather not... - Because you like him. Okay I've gotta go there's like an insane amount of dust in here. Yeah, me too. I'm meeting Simon for drinks. Oh, Simon huh? Sounds like it's going well. Don't jinx it, okay? I'm going to call you during the week to check in. I want an update on those interviews. Okay you got it, have fun. Ciao. Hi I was wondering if someone could come over and assess my property? - Hi. - Hi. Danielle, right? Yes yeah. Good morning, I'm sorry to just show up like this, not interrupting. No, no, not at all. I'm Aaron from Welling ford real estate also married to this one. Okay, Aaron nice to meet you. Likewise. When he you told me you called, I figured I would just come make the introduction. Cool well do you guys wanna come in? I was just about to make some coffee. Love some. Okay, come on in. Sorry about the mess. I promise when we have it listed, it will be spic and span. Alright not a problem. It is so beautiful. Oh, well thank you. My grandfather was actually a carpenter. He built it for my grandma back in the day. Were you close with them? Danny! No it's okay. Yeah, I was, yeah. They were sorta like a second set of parents to me. Is that them there? Yeah that's them. I feel like I recognize him. Did he used to drive one of those really huge cars from the sixties? Yeah, the beast. Oh my god he loved that car. The thing was so loud. You could hear it coming from 20 miles away. Mm-hmm. Are these your family members here too? Uh, no. Those are people that I'm interviewing for the article that I'm writing. You're a writer? Yeah I work at fifth and Madison magazine. What! That is so cool, we sell that at the store. What's the article? Well, it's actually an investigative piece on marriage. Yeah, I'm interviewing all kinds of folks. Serial bachelors, married people. I'm just trying to get a full range of perspectives. Asking if people think marriage is actually worth it in this day and age. That sounds really juicy. Hey, do you guys know anybody who may be interested in getting interviewed for the article? You could interview us. - No, no thanks we're good. - Don't be so shy. I'm not shy, just busy. Hey if you change your mind, let me know. And if you think of anyone else. Oh, I'm on it. Well, shall we take a look around? Yeah what's upstairs? Um, okay. So they're all antiques? Most of them I think, over the years. Overall the place looks good. But? It could use some upgrades if you wanna get top dollar. Are we talking big renovations or... I suggest cleaning the gutters. Then fixing the front door, boosting the overall curb appeal, you know, add some evergreen plants on the porch and stuff like that. And inside give it a good clean, some fresh paint. Fix those shelves if you can. Just stuff to make it... Function on a basic level? Alright well I'm on it. Yeah, no more breaking into the windows for you. Oh yeah, so Cole told you guys about that did he? He did yeah! You know, come to think of it Cole's pretty handy. He, does all the repairs at the store, electrical, plumbing, all of it. Mm-hmm. He could probably help you out. No I mean, I'm sure I can figure it out. But you're so busy with the article and he'd be happy to do it. Let me, I'll just go ask him. - No - Yeah, yeah. - No. - Uh... - Cole! - You really do... it's fine. Cole! Cole! Hannah needs help fixing up her cabin. And I told her you know everything, even though it annoys me to know when to say it. You're planning on selling it? Potentially, I'm not sure yet. Aaron says it needs some repairs and Hannah's got a lot on her plate. She's a writer. Oh, well I still have the store to look after and I'm really not sure I'm the right person for the job. See I totally understand he's busy. No I make his scheduling he's not that busy. You're not that busy. You said you had other contractors in mind? Well there's Mr. Collins. Mr. Collins is 83 years old, Well what about Ron? Ron is a dud. Oh he's not that bad. You know the kind of mechanic who tells you, you need a new engine when all you really needed was an oil change? Oh that wouldn't be good. So you'll do it then? We can probably work something out if that's what you want. You know, I think I could really use your help. Alright then. Excellent. Thank you. And hey listen, if you need any design inspo or you just give me a call, there's some great stores in town. There's this cute one on the main strip that just sells the cutest stuff. Ours. - Hi. - Hi. Hey, what are you doing? Oh I'm just fixing your door. It looks like the trim is coming loose. So water and ice are probably getting in the frame and warping the boards. That's why the door is sticking. I see. But I may have to tackle some of this from the inside if that's okay. You don't have to do that right now. You're probably really busy. Oh no it's no problem. I'm here and I've got my supplies so... Or I can just come back another time. You know what it's okay. Come in, come in, come on in. Yeah. - Woah! - Yeah. Yeah, I just closed the door and the whole thing sort of crumbled like a shortbread cookie Well you can add this to list too, if you want. I see why Danielle hires you out to every stranger in town. What's going on in here? Oh, I'm making my Nana's scones. Oh yeah, she made me a batch when I moved in all those years ago. I didn't know her all that well, but I do remember these being legendary. Okay, well don't get your hopes up because I haven't made them in years. Oh you don't bake much in New York? Ah, no, not anymore. I used to do it all the time as a kid with my Nana it was kind of our thing, but I haven't bought a bag of flour in years so hence the massacre. Well, no matter how it turns out I'll eat em. I'm game for any kind of dessert cake, pie, trifle you name it. Trifle huh? You don't hear that every day. Oh yeah, it's the most underrated dessert. If you ask me cookies, custard fruit it's good stuff. Even if they turn out like hockey pucks, it's still a great distraction. From work? Danielle says that you're writing an article, something about "is marriage still worth it?". Yeah, pretty much. It's my first big shot at the magazine. And if I do really well, then it might mean a permanent promotion. I'm going to be cubicle bound for the foreseeable future and have really disappointed my friend. Well, I'm sure you'll pull it off. Hey, you don't happen to know any married couples that might let me interview them for the article, do you? Maybe even you. Oh, I'm not married. But my parents, they've got that whole storybook romance thing going on, 40 years and counting. Wow unicorns do exist. You could ask them, they're probably at the store. We could put in an order for some supplies for all this while we're at it. Yeah okay that would be great. I'm confident that the kids have this covered. Yeah I think it'd be nice for the 40th anniversary. The store is doing a great job. You know, Danny, I like this display, but I think you should add a few more items. You know, I think cross-merchandising potential. Dad! Old habits die hard, honey. Alright, alright. Okay forget it. Dad you reorganize the store yet? Oh, hey how you doing? Hi honey. Mom, dad, this is Hannah she's Roselyn Moore's granddaughter. Oh the writer, Danny said that you just moved in next door to Cole. Oh yeah, temporarily. Welcome to Sherbrooke falls Hannah. Thank you it's a really lovely spot. Now let us know if you need anything, okay? Actually there was something, I was sort of wondering if I could interview you guys for an article that I'm working on and speaking to a bunch of people, getting their personal opinion on marriage and Cole here told me that you two are celebrating your 40th anniversary this weekend. We are. Yes, yes this is perfect. Oh you've got to do it. Well, you don't have to. I've always wanted to be in a magazine. What do you think, Frank? Yeah we'd be honored. Wait is tomorrow too soon? Tomorrow's the winter picnic sweety. Yeah, but Hannah should come. No I don't wanna impose. Oh not at all we would love to have you. Okay yeah, that sounds like fun count me in. Excellent and Cole here can give you a ride over. Sure. Sounds good and now if you'll excuse us. We have some work to do, this way. Thank you so much your family seems amazing. Hey you're welcome. I'm glad it worked out. Ah here just take a look. So I just finished a building for another client in this color, what do you think for the shelves? I like this one. Oh, you're right. Timeless is better it suits you. Good, um anyway, I'm just gonna call it in. Oh I can order it online if that's easier. Well, we're kind of old school. The website doesn't let you do that. Wow. I know Danny's been getting on my case about updating it, but I don't even know where to start. Well maybe I can help. I had to learn a lot about website design when I was starting out as a freelance writer. Really? Yeah do you mind if I take a look? That would be awesome, thank you, be my guest. Aww! That's a cute picture. Do you guys have another sister? No, uh that's Olivia my wife. Oh, I'm sorry I thought you weren't married. I'm not, at least not anymore. She passed away a few years ago. Cole I'm so sorry. Yeah thanks. Is that all you need from me? Yeah I think so. Okay well I'll head out. Thank you. Nice to meet you guys. What happened? Nothing. Don't look at me. You know, I could probably find my way there. You don't have to drive me. Don't worry about it, come on hop in. I bet my mom has got prime seats and hot chocolate already waiting for you. Oh no I don't wanna intrude. It's just a ride Hannah. Okay. It's cool... well here we are. I know it's probably not what you're used to in New York, - But... - It's perfect actually. I used to build campfires with my grandpa in the summers. It's really bringing me back. He was a scout leader. Oh, I see. So if I ever get lost in the woods I'll know who to call. Oh yeah. You need somebody to read a compass or build a campfire or sing a jingle, then I'm your girl. I'm sure you don't really need help with that kind of thing. Well what if I still want to see your skills in action. Oh, okay so you're challenging me? Oh maybe. Alright. First, you gotta start with the base. See some people prefer this tent shape, but this is much sturdier. It's like a chimney. It's called the log cabin lane. Ooh so you remember the name? Two more logs on top. And then light the match and... Voila! Jeez you're a baker, a girl scout, a web designer, a writer, what other random tricks do you have up your sleeve? I also cross-country ski. Is that random enough for you? Yeah it's okay. Hey, Hannah you made it. Hey, hi Mrs. Walker. It's so great to see you. You too I suppose. Hi mom. Hot cocoa, my secret recipe. Yes, please. Um listen I know that you're really busy so we can do this whenever. Oh no, it's great. We can do it now. - Frank! - Coming. I swear it's like herding calves with him sometimes. Thank you guys so much for agreeing to do this. I really appreciate it. Oh, sure. We're happy to. Do you mind if I record it? No, go ahead. Alright, so I usually start by asking how you two met and how you got to know each other. Well I met my Kimmy at the local fair. She was new to town I'd seen her at school, but I never had the courage to talk to her until we were both stuck in the fun house. You know, those rooms with mirrors and clowns and ball pits that they have at local fairs. Oh yeah. Well we were both trying to find our way out, but we couldn't and well you know, the hallways were all leading back to the same spot. I'd never been so lost or embarrassed in my life. I turn around the corner and suddenly, there she is, well 12 of her actually, thanks to all the mirrors, most beautiful sight I ever saw. And I was never so relieved to see a person, any person, I latched on to Frank, we left together and we've been joined at the hip ever since. Did you know right then you were going to marry him? Honestly, no. So you're not a believer in love at first sight? Yeah, I am. But it took a while to get her on board. Well, I happen to believe that love is more than just a feeling. It's a commitment that you make every day. Is that what makes it last in your opinion? Yep, you got to wake up every morning and decide to choose that person. Do what you can for them. Forgive them when you have to love them unequivocally and have fun whenever you can. The fun part's really important. So was there ever a time where you two thought it might be easier to just... Oh break up? No. Because life is never easy, anyway whether you're married or not. I think marriage is like a sailboat. Here we go. Sometimes it's calm waters and it's all smooth sailing. Then sometimes you get caught in a nasty storm. And when you do you feel like one of them ropes that's being stretched to its limits. And the wind is ripping at your sails. Most people are searching for a means to end that tension. And they see cutting off their spouses as a way to do so. But they may not understand that what they might be doing is cutting off their anchor instead of their sails. Wow. Our kids know that one off by heart right Cole? - Yeah. - Well, I don't blame you Frank, it's a good one I think our readers are really gonna like it. Did all the other couples you interview wax this poetic. No, I've interviewed people who prefer the single life too. I'm trying to get both perspectives. And what about you, what side are you on? Um, I'm on the fence. Yeah, I was engaged for a little while. And now it's just me and I think that's pretty great too. You know, there's room in the world for all kinds of folks. Exactly. Hey, you should come and have Sunday dinner at Cole's we're celebrating our anniversary. Oh, well I don't wanna impose. Oh, no nonsense we'd love to have you. Oh no mom don't pressure her. She doesn't have to come if she doesn't want to. I'm not pressuring honey. I'm just asking her. Okay yeah. Yeah you know what I've got so much work to do this weekend, but thank you so much for the invite. Well the offer stands and if you change your mind, great. Hey, anyway I want to introduce you to a donut over here with cinnamon. You're gonna love it. - You got a sweet tooth? - Ah, yes I do. Do I have a choice? Ah well if you don't have one you will have to eat this donut. Hey, uh can I give you a hand? Uh, yeah thank you. Okay. After you. - Here's okay? - Great. It's freezing out huh? Yeah. About earlier, I didn't mean to imply that you shouldn't come for dinner. I mean, you absolutely should if you want to. It's a bit weird though right? I'm really sorry. It's just, we haven't had a guest for Sunday dinner since Olivia died. Oh. I hadn't even thought about that fact until they invited you. And then, I was like a deer in the headlights, you know? Yeah I can imagine. At the end of the day though, it's just dinner, people sitting around the table and sharing food and honestly it would be great if you came. I don't know. Danielle and Aaron will be there. It'll be fun I promise. Can I think about it? Oh yeah, absolutely. Okay well, goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Is that the last one? Yep I gotta hand it to you. You were right about those. Wait, what's wrong? What do you mean? Nothing. You just said I was right about something. Oh yeah, well give credit where credit is due and all that. Oh. You're upset about something. No, I'm not I'm just... Is this is about the Sunday dinner freak out? Mum called and told me immediately. I didn't freak out it just took me by surprise. Whatever you say, but the fact that you feel bad about it, that's interesting. I feel bad for making our neighbor feel unwelcome that's all. So apologize. I did. So apologize better. Okay how? I dunno, do something nice for her, maybe take her out to lunch. I dunno lunch kinda feels like a date. That would be great. Danny. Fine, I'm sure you will come up with something. - Hi. - Hey, is it a bad time? Nope come on in. I thought I'd put these shelves up once and for all. Thank you. Do you need some help? Yeah, sure. I just need to get these, on these brackets here. Alright just angle that in then slid it off the back. Perfect. Couple of screws and we are done. Okay I will hold it steady. Oh perfect. Now this side. Sorry it's an awkward angle here. And we're done. I was kinda actually going to go get some air. Oh yeah same. I know this nice trail we could go for a hike. How about something a little more fun? Alright you're on. It's been a while since I've done this. Yeah. Not as good as I was when I was six, but... So how's the article coming? Slowly. Don't be too hard on yourself. No well, I just don't want to disappoint your parents. I'm sure you won't. I don't know, it's funny. I usually don't get so worried about what people think, but I just want to do right by them and their relationship, you know? They're pretty inspiring. Yeah they definitely set the bar high. What about your parents? What are they like? They're good people, but their relationship is different. I think they're more friends than anything. That part's important. Yeah, but what if that's all you have? I mean, when I was a kid, I remember them being so much more affectionate and well I guess things are bound to change right? Is that what happened with your fiance? I don't know I guess I just woke up one day and realized we were coexisting. I remember thinking, is this it? Isn't it supposed to be better? I don't know maybe I'm crazy. You're not crazy. Life's short, don't settle. How did you know Olivia was the one? I don't remember one exact moment. I just knew that coming home to her was always the best part of my day. It must be really hard. I'm getting used to it. Think you will ever get married again? I don't know, never say never, but I sometimes wonder if it's possible for me to get that lucky again. How about you, ever think you'll take the plunge? I doubt it. Is that because you think it will just fizzle out? Well statistically about a 5050 shot at making it. Love's a lot more complicated than statistics. About Sunday dinner you should come. I want you to come, I'm making this big feast at my place my mom would bring you leftovers anyways. So you might as well enjoy it while it's hot right? Well, I guess I do have to take their picture for the article. Exactly. You can do it there, two birds one stone. Okay but only if I'm allowed to bring dessert. Perfect. Okay then. Hey. Hi finally. How are you? Confused. About the article? I thought you found a couple. No, I did I'm just still struggling. There are so many thoughts. You fell for the hot neighbor didn't you? What? No. Hannah. Maybe. Oh boy. Yeah, I know it's a disaster. Why cause he's a widower. No, well maybe I don't know. I just... so much to consider. Why do I always do this to myself? Why am I always choosing unavailable men? Because you self-sabotage. Being alone is your comfort zone. That's what he said. He said that? Well I mean not in so many words, but yeah. Sounds like he's clearly paying attention. Okay yeah but his wife? Well just because he's a widower doesn't mean he's unavailable. Sounds like he could be ready to move on. And how do I know? You ask? Are you crazy? Okay well Hannah if you're not gonna put yourself out there, maybe you should write about it. Carmen, I can't do that without his permission. Well, I don't mean to publish. I just mean for you to sort through your thoughts. Writing's always been how you process things. I don't know it feels weird. It's just to get things flowing again. It'll be good for the article. Hello. Hi I'm here. Hi hi hi sorry we're early. Mum told me that Hannah said that a photographer is coming tonight to take a picture of them. And I just, I wanted to make sure your place was an order, but Jesus, its spotless. Did you sweep? Danny let the man be. Do you guys want anything to drink? Yeah, I'll take one. What is he making? Babe. This is impressive, look at this. All right here you are. And the sparkling water for the princess. Mm thank you, haha you tucked in your shirt. Yeah it's Sunday dinner. I've seen you eat dinner with sawdust in your hair. I am sorry in advance. - I knew it. - Calm down. He's not even denying it, this is amazing. This is so amazing. Right babe? Yeah man, whatever makes you happy. It's just a friendly dinner guys. Knock knock we're here. Oh hey! Mom, you look gorgeous. Doesn't she? Thank you. You look lovely hun. Thank you, mom. I just need to go outside to get some more firewood. I'll be right back. What's going on? What do you got there? Trifle, some guy told me it was pretty good stuff. You don't mind if we skip the dinner part and just go right to that, do you? Whenever you want. Hey dad, did you get the new smoker Oh yeah, we used it last week turned out great. You do know that every meal that he cooks from now and it's going to be smoked. Unfortunately yes, but it's so hard to say no because he's so enthusiastic. You know, we got some space in the back yard. No, absolutely not, no. If you spend our hot tub savings on a meat smoker, I swear, where this is. Do all couples you interview bicker like this? Oh I wouldn't call it bickering. I would call it healthy debate. Ooh! Okay you know, I read something that said it was a sign of a good marriage couples that can disagree forgive and move on easily. Oh well, then you and Aaron have the healthiest marriage of all time. Though in all seriousness, you guys seem to have it pretty figured it out. I've interviewed a lot of couples in our generation who are having a really hard time with marriage, you know, between the rising cost of living and new stressors at work that we experience in our generation that just didn't exist when our parents got married. Do you think it's harder to have a successful marriage nowadays? Well, I don't know. I'm not married, but what do you guys think? I think we're not the first generation to have hardships being granted there's been some unprecedented challenges lately. No, I think humans are hardwired for love. No matter what the state of the world is. Well there are some people that think love isn't enough to make a marriage work. Sure it is. You just have to make sure you fall in love with the right person. But how do you know it's the right person? Well, this is not scientific or anything, but I would say if that person makes you feel like home. Anyway, it looks like you got an interview out of us after all and Aaron didn't have to say a word. Well that, I mean that was great. Do you mind if I use some of that? Oh, I would be honored. Yeah. Who's up for dessert? Oh me. No, I'll get it. Sit, sit. Coffee anyone? Always honey. Just have one Frank, you know, you'll be up till 3:00 AM. That's what naps are for my dear. So Hannah, how is the cabin renovations coming along? Aaron been able to list it yet? Uh, no, not yet. I do have someone interested when you're ready. That's good to know. Look at this magical thing. Oh my gosh trifle, that is Cole's favorite. Did you make that? I did yeah. Well now. So who wants some? Thank you so much for this. My parents are really enjoying all the reminiscing. My mom must have redone her hair like five times in there. Are you kidding? It's my pleasure. Your family, they're incredible people. And I think they really like you too. So how do I look? - Perfect - So where do we sit? Center of the couch would be great. Hey, Danielle, Aaron, why don't you guys hope in here too? Really? Yes grab a seat. How's my hair? Oh you look great. Don't just say that. I'm not you look fantastic. If it's, I don't want to mess everything up, but maybe we could get one with me too for the website The website? Yeah Hannah agreed to help give it a facelift. Yeah but we can use the old photo too. No I think a new photo is a great idea. - Let's do it. - Okay, alright hop in. Thank you so much, Hannah. That's incredibly nice of you. Are you kidding? You guys have done so much for me. It's the least I can do. Okay here we go guys big smile. I mean, I don't think it's going to get better. You get out of there. Danielle, Aaron, could you guys look at each other? Mm-hmm that's beautiful. Love it. - Happy anniversary! - Happy anniversary! I can't believe your dad ate much of this trifle. It's seriously impressive. Oh, you know how they met at the fair, well, the part that he'd left out was that he had just won a hot dog eating contest, like 20 minutes before he went into the fun house. Luckily for my mom, he can hold his food. Otherwise Danny and I might not even exist. Okay well that's an important detail. I promise not to include in the article. Oh no you should, my mom would laugh. Thanks for having me tonight I hope it wasn't too weird. Oh no, it wasn't, it was great. You're welcome any time. Well maybe next time I can host. Oh, you wouldn't want my whole family in your place messing it all up they're like a tornado... I was thinking more you and I. I'd love that. Okay. Is tomorrow too soon? No that's perfect. All right, I'll see you tomorrow. Good morning. Good morning. How are you? I'm good. Hey, do you guys have a printer back there? I just got to print off my article, do some editing, the whole red pen thing. For sure yeah. I also wanted to tell you, thank you so much for coming to dinner the other night and for the awesome photo shoot, I had a blast. Yeah, I did too. So all of our real estate info is just over there on the community board. Hey hey! Hey, what's going on over here? The gossip train leaves the station... Don't flatter yourself. Uh, is Aaron around? That lady wanted to talk to someone about real estate. Oh yeah he's at the office. I'll let him know. Maybe you won't have any trouble selling your place then. Yeah, I don't know, I forgot how much I like it here. I'm not so sure I'm ready to sell yet. Okay Hannah I think I got everything. Perfect. For the flowers. Thank you very much. Good luck editing. Thank you. I'll see you later then? Definitely. So you're seeing Hannah later? Yes. As in for renovations or? No we finished most of those. Oh great. Okay I can't take it anymore. Are you going on a date with her or not? It's happening? It's really happening? Calm down. This is perfect. I can't believe it. It's just dinner right now. Yeah but you like her. I do, yeah. Wow. Miracles do exist. Don't ever tell me miracles don't exist. I'm really happy for you Cole. - Hi. - Hi. Come on in. Yes thank you. The place is really starting to come together. Thanks. I've been meaning to pick up a couple more things to finish it up. Oh, uh just going to check on dinner, but please take your coat off. Make yourself at home. How's the article coming? Good, yeah. Down to the wire I've got to get it in first thing. Well, if you need another set of eyes, I could always read it for you. I'll keep that in mind thank you. Cole and Olivia, what's this? Oh, that's nothing... Did you write about Olivia and me? No, I just printed it out by mistake. Is this for the article? No, it's not for the article. I was just... What? Uh, well, I was just trying to sort through my feelings about all this. So I wrote it out. It was supposed to help give me some clarity. What does that even mean? I was just confused and overwhelmed by everything that was happening between us. Look, I'm sorry that you even had to see it. Us? There is no us. We just had one date. Um yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I just gotta, I gotta go. Cole wait. Hi Aaron it's Hannah. I was just wondering, is your buyer still interested in my place? Okay that would be great thank you. Hey. Hey, thank you for having us on such short notice. No problem, you can head on in if you want. I hope everything's okay. Yeah just time to go I think. Understood. I hope she likes it. You and Cole did a great job. I'm positive she'll make an offer. Thank you Aaron. You're welcome. So you want her to leave? I never said that. Well Aaron just got an offer on her cabin. Okay. Okay, that's your answer? It's her decision, what do you want me to do? Well, forgive her and apologize yourself for storming off. I didn't storm off. Well you kinda of did. Don't let a misunderstanding ruin this. You guys are a great match. It's not a misunderstanding. She wrote about Olivia. She wrote about our marriage. Yeah, for herself, not to publish. And can you blame her? I mean, you always keep things so close to your chest. How is she supposed to know how you're feeling or if you're ready to move on? I'm pretty sure I made that clear. Okay sending signals is not the same thing as talking about it... I talked about it. You talked about Olivia or about your feelings for Hannah. Don't give up so easily. It's not that simple. Just call her. She may be great, but that doesn't make us a good match. She prefers to be alone. People change all the time. You were a lone wolf too once before Olivia. Just think about it. Aaron hey. Yeah I am just filling out the paperwork and signing it right now. I will get it over to you in two seconds. Okay, thank you. Hi. Hey, did you get the article. I did. And? And it was fantastic. You really think so? Really. And I also wish the walkers were my neighbors like, come on. Are you okay? No it was just so unlike me. I know you convinced yourself that your life is supposed to look different or that you're doomed to be alone ever since Kyle, but it's okay if you want more. Yeah, but he's right I mean technically there is no us. Love does not care about technicalities. Well, it doesn't matter anyway, I just accepted an offer on the cabin. What, why? Because I'm not going to use it and it was a good offer. Hannah come on you just did the best work of your career there. You fell in love. Are you sure you want to sell it? Look, I know that you're trying to help and I really appreciate it, but right now I just want to wallow in my sorrows and eat junk food until we pass out. Okay I'll order us the biggest pizza I can find. And we're gonna watch true crime documentaries all night long until we fall asleep. Thank you. My dearest Hannah, by now you know that I am gone and you may be holding the keys to the old cabin in Sherbrooke falls. The place that houses my most treasured memories, Oh boy. But a house is just four walls If it's not filled with the people you love. She always knew what to say. Hannah, you know you have to go back and profess your love right? What if it doesn't work out? But what if it does? There's always risks nothing's a sure bet. Even Nana had doubts. You're not going to know unless you try. Yeah but Aaron already sold the cabin. Well you're gonna have to stop him. Come on. You're right. Okay. Uh, okay! Keys. Wish me luck. You're not going to need it because no matter what happens, it's gonna be okay. I met your grandfather in that town when I was 21. I know to you, that must seem young. But back in my day, reaching that milestone without any prospects of marriage was cause for concern. But I was committed to my freedom and I wanted nothing to do with marriage. And then I met your grandfather. I worried that my affection would fade and that I might feel trapped, but as luck would have it, my love for your grandfather only grew and our life didn't feel like a compromise. It felt like home. It gives me great comfort to know that there will be a place for you. Should you decide to keep it. I adore you Hannah. And you can bet your bottom dollar. I am missing you at this exact moment, wherever I am. All my love, Nana. It's so good right? Check this out. Isn't that great? You look fabulous. Cole. Hey Cole, come check this out. What happened? Hannah's article came out. Oh. But don't you want to read it? I don't know. Cole you have to read it. We'll cover for you here, take your time read it. I'm good dad. Oh, for Pete's sake, just read it you dummy. She loves you. What? Read it. So, Cole? It's a great article. She's a good writer and you guys she tells your story better than you do I'd have to say. It is it good isn't it? Did you read to the end? Yeah, I read it. Okay let me. And I quote, "One can't help but wonder" if the Walker's marriage is the exception to the rule. An out liar in a downward facing trend, but then you meet their children. Who in spite of their hardships have refused to succumb to cynicism. Spend enough time with them, "and you too may become a believer in lasting love." She loves you. That's not what that says. You need to go find her. I don't know I just... Honey it's okay to be scared. It's a big thing, moving on. But it's worth it. She's worth it. How do I know where to find her? Aaron probably has her address on file somewhere. I can get him to text it to you, go. Are you going to be fine here though? - Go ahead. - We'll be fine go. Cole go! Good luck Honey. Cole! Cole! Cole! Come on. Hannah! Aaron! Hi. What's going on? Listen I changed my mind I don't wanna sell. But I thought you said... I'm sorry I know it's crazy, but I want to stay here, my house. But we just finished the final inspection. Is there anything you can do? Well, technically they haven't signed the contract yet since it was based on this final inspection. So meaning? I think I can talk her out of it. Thank you. Thank you so much. - You got it. - Okay. Hannah? Cole, hey! What are you doing? My key got stuck in the thing... I actually came to see you. Hannah I owe you an apology. - No you don't... - Yes I do. I know that you were never going to publish that piece about Olivia and me. Just in the moment there was so much going on in my head. I think I was scared about what was going on with us. Felt like an out, so I took it. I'm so sorry Cole. Don't be, look I never planned to fall for anyone after Olivia. I didn't even think it was possible. And all of a sudden, here you are. And I'm thinking about you all the time and I'm coming up with excuses to see you. And I wouldn't let myself admit what was happening there was an us because it came with all these other feelings too. Bottom line is, I think I'm falling for you. And I really don't want you to leave. Please don't go. You know I spent so much time trying to convince myself. That what I was feeling between us was just a flash in the pan. Bound to fade, because, Cole that's all I have ever known. And the more time I spent getting to know you and your family The more it felt like home. And I started thinking maybe I was wrong. You know maybe he could be different maybe... we could be different. I am not going anywhere Cole.
