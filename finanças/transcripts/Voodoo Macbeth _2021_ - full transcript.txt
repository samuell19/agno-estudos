(projector clicks, whirs) (jazz music) (jazzy trumpet playing) (soft chatter) ROSE: Come, you spirits. Unsex me here and fill me from the crown to the toe top full of direst cruelty! Make thick my blood, that my keen knife see not the wound it makes. We've been through this, Rose. It's too expensive. We need money for an entire season. If our first play fails, so does the whole unit. But if it succeeds. I want you to meet someone. Our Scottish king. Juano Hernandez. Watch us work. If you don't like it, I'll never mention it again. What? Art thou afeard to be the same in thine own act and valor -as thou art in desire? -Prithee, peace! I dare do all that may become a man. When you durst do it, then you were a man. I have given suck and know how tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me. I would, while it was smiling in my face, have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums and dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn -as you have done. -If we should fail... Screw your courage to the sticking-place, and we'll not fail. (sighing) Who would direct? I was wondering, maybe-- No, Rose. You know this can't be a personal vanity project. You have someone in mind? ORSON WELLES: Hold-Fast Hairspray's formula for robust staying power is unparalleled in the hair care industry. Hold-Fast Hairspray. In moisture and heat, Hold-Fast won't skip a beat. "In" moisture and heat, Orson, can you please emphasize the word "in," -just like I asked? -For Christ's sake, there's no universe in which the word "in" is emphasized at the beginning of a respectable English sentence. Wait, let me explain something to you. -Money, talent. -Please, George. From the depths of your ignorance, please explain. -(receiver dings) -John! Come in. -Orson. -(laughing) Mm! How the hell are you? In hell, as a matter of fact. -So it is possible. -I beg your pardon? To emphasize "in" at the beginning of a sentence. From time to time, directors need a swift kick in the ass. Orson Welles, meet Rose McClendon. I saw you in Mulatto at The Vanderbilt. Oh, you were captivating. To what do we owe the pleasure? We are mounting a play. What's the role? Actually, Orson... we... want you to direct. The Scottish play. In Harlem. For the Negro Theater Unit. I'll be Lady M. And who, pray tell, will be seeing this play? Last time I checked, the average Harlemite isn't curled up on his couch, reading Faustus. When did you last chat with the average Harlemite, Mr. Welles? How many directors turned you down before you came to me? JOHN: You were our first choice. John, I'm an actor. ROSE: Mr. Welles, this production is more important than you can imagine for Negro theater, for Harlem. It's risky. But you do love to take risks, don't you? Your Romeo was the boldest and best I've seen. It closed after three performances. Always a pleasure, John. Once more into the breach, George! Arrogant, petulant child. -Yeah. -How old is he, exactly? Twenty, I think. But he might just be a genius. Well, your boy genius rejected us. (sighing) Good evening, Mr. Welles. -Good evening, Maurice. -Payday? Not nearly enough for the utter incompetence -I have to endure. -(laughing) (keys jingling) We have a date. I couldn't leave this chair if I tried. Well, surely there's something we can do that will motivate you. -Hmm... -(laughing) Houseman came to the studio today. With that actress. Rose McClendon. And what did they want? They wanted me to direct the Negro Theater Unit's production of the Scottish play. -Macbeth? -Shh! Oh, that silly superstition. -When do you start? -I don't. -I turned them down. -What? If I'm going to direct, it needs to be something that -will put me on the map. -A white man doing Negro Shakespeare won't do that? You would be the talk of the town. Or would you rather keep wasting your talent spouting mindless radio ads? (laughing) Where are you going? We are going out. ♪ You will hear me say ♪ ♪ Baby, won't you please come home? ♪ (trumpet solo) Two gin rickeys, please. ♪ Every hour in the day ♪ -Incredible, huh? -♪ You will hear me say ♪ ♪ Baby, won't you please come home? ♪♪ EMCEE: Miss Edna Thomas, everyone! (applause) Thank you. Edna! Miss Thomas? Hello. My name is Virginia Welles. This is my husband Orson. Nice to meet you. Edna, have you ever done theater? Uh, why, no, I only just started singing professionally. My husband is directing a play. I'm actually not. Why don't you come audition? I'm sorry, which play? -Shakespeare. -(coughing) It... begins with an "M," I hate to speak in riddles, but the name is supposedly cursed, and my husband is terribly superstitious. As I said, I've never acted. Well, it's the ultimate tragedy. Murder, betrayal, revenge. It would be a great way to showcase your beauty and your talent. -What do you say? -Excuse me. I have to get backstage. It was a pleasure to meet you, Edna. You have a lovely voice. -Tell me why you're so afraid. -"Afraid." Of Houseman's offer. There aren't enough Negro actors who understand Shakespeare, let alone speak it. So direct them. Here I was, thinking I'd married a real artist, but at the first chance at true originality, and he runs for the door. Do you know how many productions of the Scottish play are being done in Manhattan -as we speak? -So set yours apart. Mm! How many Negro Scots do you know? What if they weren't Scottish? It's set in Scotland. What if it wasn't? -(drumming) -MAN: There it is. (overlapping chatter) WOMAN: Okay. ORSON: The Caribbean. Orson? The play is set in 19th century Haiti. Not with witchcraft. With voodoo. -Voodoo? -Voodoo. I've decided to accept the position, by the way. I gathered. We've ruled out the Scottish play. It's not Scottish anymore. Imagine: a jungle. Hot and humid-- Will I need my Hold-Fast Hairspray? (drumming) Jungle drums. The din of the jungle canopy. Voodoo spirits conjuring powers beyond imagination. Mr. Welles. We're exploring other options now. So stop. The play is here. This must be fun for you. To say "no" one day and then come charging in here the next because you had a voodoo vision during your morning bowel movement. Well, typically my bowel movements occur at night, Mrs. McClendon. (snorts) You came to me for fresh ideas. It doesn't get any fresher than this. It's the Scottish play, only not Scottish anymore. It's the Bard's words but not the way those stiffs at the Royal Shakespeare Company have been spouting off for 300 years. We can turn this old play on its head and still thrillingly tell the same story. Or... we could explore these other options here. I mean, I'm sure Harlem theatergoers will love Two Gentlemen of Verona, as long as they don't fall asleep in the first act. How badly do you want to play Lady M.? Would I have to wear a sheep's skull on my head? (stirring music) ROSE: Too many damn white people. He hired a white set designer and his wife as the producer. It's the Negro Theater Unit. Negro. Your white boy better get that straight. All right. I'll speak to him. You're a king. Not an earthworm. Have a spine. Again. "Fair and noble hostess, we are your guests tonight--" Next. Wait-- please? I have always dreamed of being an actor, but if I don't catch a break soon, I'm gonna be an electrician forever. Huh. I applaud your enthusiasm. All right, you're in the show. Do you mean it, Mister? Thank you. Miss. Put him down as Murderer #3 and get him a tool belt. -Murderer #3 has a line. -Not anymore. Orson, Virginia. How's it going? As I feared, competent actors are proving -difficult to find. -Hello, John. Okay, up next, we have Jack Carter. We saw him in a production of Porgy. He's quite talented. -Orson, we need to talk. -Shh! Is that a dagger I see before me? The handle toward my hand? -Should I stop him? -No-no. Come, let me clutch thee. I have thee not, yet I see thee still. Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible to feeling as to sight? Oh... Virginia, take over. Um... next! ACTOR: Look on it again, I dare not. Rose, do you intend to play Lady M. from a chair? Stand up. VIRGINIA: Let's move on. Whenever you're ready, go ahead. -Find me actors, John. -This is chaos. -This is theater. -(chuckling) This is still exploratory. We don't have the money to pay all these people yet. Everything will be swell, trust me. I do, within limits. I have no limits. That's why you hired me. True. But your crew is too white. Too white? Have you looked in the mirror lately? We're supposed to be creating jobs -for Negroes, Orson. -Nat designed Calling All Stars. It's a divine miracle I got him. All right, but you get rid of the rest of them. Including Virginia. Virginia's my wife. I'm aware. I attended the wedding. She's my partner in this, John, she's invaluable. Rose is adamant. VIRGINIA: All right, all right, wonderful. (soft jazz playing) Thank you. To the Haitian play. To... the Haitian play. (clink) -So, I had a thought. -Mm! Remember that singer Edna Thomas? She would make a superb Lady Macduff. And for Banquo... Thirsty, darling? (groans) Houseman... has ordered me to fire you. What? I'm the producer. Rose thinks the crew is too white. So you fired Nat, too? Well, no. We still need a designer. But you don't need me?! -Shh! -Voodoo was my idea. Actually, it was both our idea. -Ready to order? -No, I'm not hungry. There's no need for the dramatics. Oh, that's rich, coming from you. Something with pork for my husband. What's the expression? "You are what you eat"? Oh! (sighing) (distant music, laughter) WOMAN: That's Cuba Johnson! (cheering) (chanting): Champ! Champ! Champ! (chanting continues) Drinks on me, Joe. I'm feeling good, baby. (laughing) Oh, that's right, I'm Cuba Johnson, the motherfuckin' champ. (laughing) Yeah, who dares go toe to toe with the Manhattan Bull? Name one person in this city who could survive this left hook. (laughing) Have you met my wife? (soft laughter) Well, will you look at this cracker-lookin' fella here? (soft laughter) Looks like she did a... a number on you already. -(laughing) -Tell you what. (sighing) Look like you need to take a swing at somebody. I'll give you one hit. (patrons ooh-ing) You may be a middleweight champ... but I'm a heavyweight drinker. You get one swing. If I'm still standing... I get one right back. -(Orson grunting) -(laughter) -Oh! -(clamoring) (chanting): Champ! Champ! Champ! (chanting continues) (groaning) That was nothing. (patrons murmuring) You're all right, kid. (laughter) (laughing) Another for my... my new friend here, Joe. Yes, sir. So... this ugly mother steps in the ring, right? (laughing) Looked like a goddamn Viking. -Red hair, everything. -(laughing) And-- And he's just swinging with the full force of his Irish weight behind every punch. (grunting) (laughter) So I let him swing at me for three rounds. Three of the longest rounds of my life. Mm. But then I step out in the fourth... (laughing) ...and knocked his lights out with one left hook-- bam! (laughter) He was so tired, I think he stayed down so he could sleep. (sighing) Do you know what you've got, Cuba? What have I got, Orson? What we call stage presence. Good evening, Maurice. Good morning, Mr. Welles. Hmm. Whence is that knocking?! Holy hell. I heard that you were directing the Scottish play, Mr. Welles. -You heard right, I-- -How is't with me when every noise appalls me? -Maurice-- -What hands are here-- -Maurice. -(clearing throat) Oh. -Good morning. -Mm-hmm. Good morning, Mrs. Winston. -Good morning, dear. -Welcome. Ha! They pluck out mine eyes! Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood clean from my hands? Acting has always been one of my secret dreams, you know? Not so secret anymore. Just come by the theater tomorrow, hmm? Thank you! WOMAN: Let's go. (distant music playing softly) Where are you going? I have an audition for a film. Did you think you were the only one in this household with a career? Well, good luck then. You know, you really should consider film. Theater is a dying medium. (door slams) Oh, horror! Horror! Horror! Stop. Can we try that again, Cuba? Remember, you've just looked into the king's chambers and found his murdered corpse. How would you react? Oh, horror! Horror, horror! Better. Most "saycra-ledgous" murder-- Mr. Welles, a word? (sighing) Cuba... the word is "sacrilegious." That's what I said, "saycra-ledgous." No, there's no D. You added a D. A houseplant could act better. He has stage presence. He is presently on stage. That's the extent of his stage presence. Are you drunk? I was drunk. Tragically, it's past tense. JOHN: Orson! Great news. A congressman is coming tomorrow to witness our progress. There is no progress. Rose is being hard on herself. It's hard to progress when you're so exceptionally talented already. Awake! Awake! Alarum bell! Murder and treason! You're bringing a grimy politician -to my theater? -That grimy politician is a big supporter of the New Deal, and the New Deal, if you'll recall, Orson, is funding this entire bloody project. Just show him a little spectacle, and play nice. Wish you could stay, John! The performances are unbelievable! (whispering): Where could he be... Ah! (chuckling) John Houseman, I reckon. I love what you're doing for community theater. An honor to meet you, Congressman. Oh, a limey. Sorry, gentlemen, can I get just one more handshake for the camera? Certainly, right here. -(flashbulb pops) -Okay. -(chuckling) -Thank you. Right this way. Well, it seems like you're... got a new production cooking up. I'm here to get a taste. We have the finest Negro actors in New York. What? Excellent. So, uh, what's the name of the play you're showin'? Martin Dies, meet Orson Welles. -Our director. -Well, Mr. Welles, it's a pleasure. That's a nice shiner there, kiddo. Well, theater is a tough business. Rivaled only by politics. (laughter) Rose McClendon, our Lady M. Of course, of course. Juano Hernandez, our Scottish king. Mr. Hernandez. So where are you from, son? I've been in New York a while. Well, show me what you got here! (laughter) Let's reset to the top of the scene. ("thunder" rumbling) Double, double, toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble. By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes. How now, you secret midnight hags? What is it you do? WITCHES: A deed without name. JUANO: I conjure you by that which you profess. Answer me to what I ask. -Speak! -Demand! We'll answer! -(all cackling) -(soft chatter) If you could just return to your seat. -Sir? -Congressman, wait, please. Mr. Dies! What were those hideous masks? -It's voodoo. -Foreigners and witchy mumbo-jumbo. The New Deal funds American theater. Now, this is un-American. Our nation is under attack... by communism. This play has nothing to do with communism. Yes, it does! You see, communism... is a cancer. And it breeds... in nests... of subversive, radical ideas, and slowly corrupts our society. And it is my righteous cause to eradicate it wherever I see it. I can assure you that that monstrosity... will never see opening night. (speaking indistinctly) (door opens) John? Congratulations, chaps. Let's put on a play. (cheering and applause) ORSON: Okay! Let's get to work. See, John? Congratulations. The king's two sons are stolen away and fled, which puts upon them suspicion... Can't I just say, "which makes them suspicious"? Say the words Shakespeare gave you and mean what you just said. Then 'tis most like the sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth. What's "sovereignty"? It means he's now king. Macbeth is king? What did you just say? -I said, is Mac-- -Stop! No! Leave the theater now. -You firing me? -No, it's the curse. -The curse? -A lot of people have died, a ton of accidents. It's said President Lincoln read the play the day before he was assassinated. So no one says the M-word in a theater. Except in the context of the play. Y'all are serious? We are deadly serious. So get your muscle head out of my theater. When you're outside, turn around three times and spit. -The hell you talking about-- -Come on, I'll show you. -Hey, y'all crazy. -Watch out! Holy Christ. Nat! Make sure it's secure. For Christ's sake. Okay. Spin around three times and spit over your left shoulder. Now say "Angels and ministers of grace, defend us." "Angels and ministers of grace, def-defend us"? It's from Hamlet. Hamlet? -(laughing) -(laughing) Okay... all right. Okay, now we just... now we just knock on the door, wait to be let back in. Okay! Let's move, people. Opening night is less than two months away. Let's take it from the top. You have a wife? Man, I've been a... a sailor, a jazz musician, circus performer, now I'm a boxer. Ain't no time for someone in all of that. How about you, you got a missus? Nah, not my style. How'd you get those? Yeah, my pa. Yeah, he used to beat me up pretty good. One day I decided... to stop going down with his punches, so the bastard put a nail in his fists. My older brother thought it a good idea to put his cigarettes out there. That right? That's what makes a man. Tolerance for pain. That's a nice tie. You like it? Yeah. It's a good color. (chuckling) -Something funny? -Um... In some circles, a red tie has a certain meaning. What's that? It means you like men. (laughter) There's a masquerade on Friday. 144th and Amsterdam? You can come if you'd like. You calling me a homosexual? No, I was not-- I just changed in front of a fuckin' queer?! -You enjoy that?! -No, I-I'm sorry, I shouldn't've said anything. Yeah-yeah, you better watch your mouth. You askin' to lose a tongue. (piano playing) ♪ All by myself ♪ ♪ I get lonely... ♪ ♪ Watching the clock ♪ ♪ On the shelf... ♪ ♪ I'd love to rest my weary head ♪ ♪ On somebody's shoulder... ♪ ♪ I'd hate to grow older ♪ ♪ All by myself ♪♪ (cheering and applause) -(blowing) -Who are you? Uh... is Miss Edna Thomas available? It's Mrs. Thomas. Well, I'm a friend of Mrs. Edna Thomas. Who's there? Mom, I wanna go home. -(chuckling) -Mr. Welles. Ms. Edna Thomas, um, remember that play I said I wasn't directing? -Sure. -Well, I changed my mind, and I want to offer you a part. Baby, you should head inside. Don't get comfortable, I'm leaving. Um. Uh, okay, um... in short... I would love for you to be my Lady Macduff. I've never even read Shakespeare. Much of the cast is in the same boat. I work at night. We rehearse during the day. I have Clarissa during the day. She can be involved, too. You're running out of excuses. -(laughs) -God. -What do you say? -Ugh... I'll see you next week? Good night. Thank you. Thank you, Gin. You are gonna be wonderful. -Good night. -Good night. Orson! You missed the party. -Who are these people? -I got the part! -I was hoping to introduce-- -Who was he? Who was he? That's Peter. That's the director. He's such a doll. I could introduce you... Next time. Would you go over my lines with me? Seriously, Virginia? I'd have thought you knew that damn play backwards and forwards by now. I'm making some changes. Orson Welles, Shakespeare of the 20th century. -Wait, you're cutting that? -Virginia, I'm working! (sighs) Aren't you excited for me? The lead role in a film? Can we please continue this discussion tomorrow, dear? Fine. I'm turning in. Would you come to set on my first day of filming? When is it? A week from tomorrow. -Orson. -Huh? When is it? -A week from tomorrow. -Yes. Yes, yes. As long as we're on schedule. It's important to me. -Promise? -I promise. Act Three, Scene Four. Banquet prepared. Enter the king. -Lady M. -Mr. Welles. Yes, Lady Rose? Juano isn't here. Wonderful. Just wonderful. Okay, okay. Well, we wait for nobody. Act Four, Scene Two. Lady Macduff. Where's Edna? -Edna? -(foot stomps) You're up. The king has hired murderers to kill Macduff and his family-- damn it! We haven't hired any murderers yet. Never mind, never mind, I'll do it. Uh, okay, okay, let's go, people, let's go. Whither should I fly? I have done no harm. -What are these faces? -Where is your husband? I hope in no place so unsanctified where such as thou mayst find him. -He is a traitor. -Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain! What, you egg! Young fry of treachery! Ugh! You called me an egg. That's silly. Concentrate, Clarissa. We're trying to kill you. VIRGINIA: Hello, everybody! I brought sandwiches. I'm afraid all they had was tuna. I could eat a can of shoe polish right about now. -So kind of you, darling. -Mm. Edna... what are you doing here? Mr. Welles cast me as Lady Macduff. Is that so? You're doing marvelously, Edna. Wherever did you find her, Orson? Virginia, sweetheart, we're only a few weeks away from opening. Of course. Silly me, what would a little wife know of such things? So good to see you again, Edna. I leave you in my husband's capable hands. They all say he's a genius. Do enjoy the sandwiches, everyone. (door slams) Has anyone seen Juano yet?! (sighing) Honey, relax. You're a natural. I sing, yes, I speak... no. Remember: it's all about her pain and anger. Her husband has fled, leaving her to raise a child on her own. You know that pain? Pull from that. (knocking on door) -Excuse me, Edna? -Yes, Mr. Welles? Oh, call me Orson. I wanted to apologize for my wife's behavior. Uh, no need to apologize. Marriage can bring out the best and worst in us. She's wide, we'll have to take it out. Uh, thank you. Uh, something wrong, Mr. Welles? Orson. Edna, I'd love to take you out sometime. We can talk about the play. Your character. I just want to get to know you a little bit better. You know? I-I know it's preposterous. I know I have a wife, but... You are married. I'm a mother and a widow. The man I loved... the man I still love... he watches over me. Run, mother, I pray you! -Argh! -(laughter) Did I perform well, Mr. Welles? You were magnificent. He said I was magnificent. EDNA: Honey, grab your coat. We gotta get you home. ROSE: There you are. I'm going to look for Juano. I'll go. In this neighborhood? Best I go with you. So you'll be my bodyguard? Who said I would protect you? (indistinct chatter, laughter) Good evening, gentlemen. MEN: Good evening. (scoffs) Come on, Mr. Welles. (man speaking in distance) You'll alert all of Harlem. Juano! (coughing) Lo siento, que-- que necesita? ORSON: Uh... I... Uh... We just wanted to know... Yo estoy trabajar con Juano. En teatro. Why don't you wait downstairs? Esta bien, Señora Hernandez? Que paso? No. (continuing in Spanish) MAN: Excuse me. Well, what did she say? Immigration took him. Christ, he's from Puerto Rico. He's an American citizen. Ah, so there is a heart beating in there after all. Well... we'll have to find a replacement. Maybe I could. Maybe you could what, Orson Welles? It would be the first time in theater history that Lady M. would actually murder her husband. I heard a Negro play down on Lenox Avenue the other night, by the pale dull pallor of an old gas light. He did a lazy sway to the tunes o' those Weary Blues. With his ebony hands on each ivory key, he made that poor piano moan with melody. Oh, groove, swayin' to and fro on his rickety stool, he played that sad raggedy tune like a musical fool. Sweet Blues... First time at poetry night? Jack Carter. What brings you here? Casting. Seems my Scottish king has been stolen from me. Shit... I borrowed the complete works of Billy Shakespeare from the prison library, devoured 'em all. Remember your audition? You were fried. POET: ...I wish that I had died. Thank you, thank you, thank you. EMCEE: Langston Hughes, everyone. -Next up-- -Jack Carter! Is this a dagger I see before me? The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee. I have thee not. And yet I see thee still. Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible to feeling as to sight? Or art thou but a dagger of the mind? A false creation proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain? Thee still... and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood-- I go, and it is done! The bell invites me. Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell that summons thee to heaven or to hell! (soft applause) The witches prophesied that M. would become king, so he murdered Duncan and became king himself. They also predicted that his children would not inherit the throne, and Banquo's offspring would. So, he hired murderers, you two, to murder his friend Banquo, hmm? Let's just try it. Tom, you say all the lines. Uh, Barry, just try to look murderous, hmm? Okay? Jack, proceed. You know Banquo was your enemy? TOM: True, my lord. Thence it is to your assistance that I do make love. (clears throat) We shall perform what you command. JACK: It must be done tonight. Okay, Jack, you lead them off stage left. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, then you turn back. Uh-huh, right. Proceed. It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight, if it find Heaven, must find it out tonight. And Lady M. is entering. And Lady M. is entering... -(coughing) -Mm-hmm. And she is speaking. How now, my lord? Why do you keep alone? JACK: Better be with the dead than sleep in the affliction of these terrible dreams which shake us nightly and torture of the mind. Things without all remedy should be without regard. What's done is done. -(coughing) -Full of scorpions in my mind, dear one. (coughing) What's to be done? Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, till thou applaud the deed. -(coughing) -Everyone take ten, please. Excellent work, Jack. I've got a few notes. Just... give me a few minutes, please. (coughing) What is it? Pleurisy. Not a very friendly disease. (Orson sighs) Are you still my Lady M.? Oh, Lord, I want to be. (sighs) Do you know who George Poage is? Mm-mm. In 1904, the Olympic Games were held in St. Louis. I took my little brother to the track and field events. (chuckles) That year, George Poage became the first Negro to win a medal. Bronze, in the 400 meter hurdles. From that day on, my brother wanted nothing more than to win gold at that event. But his legs didn't take him fast enough to even outrun the boys in the schoolyard. His mind was crossing finishing lines, while his feet were barely out of the blocks. Our bodies fail all of us at some point. They're not as strong as our dreams. (sighs) Have you been seeing a doctor? I did, for a while. Why'd you stop? Does it look like it was helping? Who knows? You and me, and that's the way it's gonna stay for as long as possible. I will be Lady M. until a geyser of blood springs from my mouth, and I convulse on stage. (both laugh) Don't laugh at a dying lady. That day comes, Rose, I'm sure you'll still find a way to scold me on the blocking. From time to time, directors need a swift kick in the ass. Oh, don't steal my lines, Rose. Only if you keep our secret. As long as possible. -(soft audience chatter) -(music playing) (exhaling) (loud laughing) (distant voices) Hey, sugar. Just talk to me, huh? -Oh, my God. -(both laughing) (soft piano playing) Merci. Every time I come to one of these, it gets whiter and whiter. White boys can be queens, too. (scoffs) You can paint a stripe on a horse, but that don't make it a zebra. (chuckling) Bonsoir, monsieur. -I'm-- I'm sorry. -It's okay. -I-I should go. -Can I have a dance before you go? (slow jazz playing) ♪ ♪ (chanting): Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut it down! (chant continues) (overlapping shouting) Again, from the top! (clears throat) And a stage whisper, please, Jack. There's blood upon thy face-- No, no, a stage whisper implies that the character is whispering, but it still needs to be loud enough for the audience to hear, obviously. Again. There's blood upon thy face. 'Tis Banquo then. -Is he dispatched? -My lord, his throat is cut. (chuckles) Thou art the best of the cutthroats. Most royal sir, his son has-- has escaped. Get thee gone. Really lose your temper, Jack. If Banquo's son has escaped, he's still a threat to the throne. Mm. Get thee gone. -You stink of booze. -So do you. I am still doing my job. Proceed. I drink to the general joy of the whole table and our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss. Which of you have done this? Shake not thy gory locks at me. For Christ's sake, Jack, you're talking to a ghost. React to that. You're seeing Banquo, who you just ordered to be murdered. He's dead, yet here he is! Where is your panic? Your fear? Rose, proceed. Sit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus-- the fit is momentary. JACK: Avaunt, and quit my sight. Thy bones are marrowless. Are marrowless! Thy blood is cold! Thou hast no sight in those eyes with which thou dost glare! That's how I want it done, Jack! If you're going to drink on the job, at least let it inform your performance. Let's take a break, everyone. No, we're gonna do it again and again, -until we get it right. -Orson, please. Your king is behaving like a lunatic. He's talking to an empty chair. While everyone is sitting around, acting like they're sipping tea at a queen's garden party. There are protestors outside right now, who want us to fail. Again. From the top. (sighs) (knocking on door) Come in. Rose, we have a serious problem. Oh, you think so? You can't go in without an appointment. JOHN: This will only take a moment. But you can't-- Come back! Excuse me, you can't... Our funding has been delayed. -I'm sorry, sir, I-- -It-It's all right, Miss Evans, it's all right. It's polite to make an appointment. Our checks have been bouncing. Well, that's unfortunate. To my knowledge, the Federal Theatre Project has received all its funding. You might want to take it up with them. Opening night... is two weeks away. And our leading man has disappeared. Actually, Mr. Dies, he has been detained by immigration. Fail to see how this concerns me. It was right after you showed up. Well, he was a foreigner. If I recall. He's from Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, if you recall. (coughing) -(continues coughing) -Our production, Congressman, it lies upon a man of your stature-- --the New Deal funds American theater. Not this dark commie witchy mumbo-jumbo that you call voodoo. It's way too subversive for true Americans. Too subversive or too Black, Congressman? Ha-ha. It's time for you and your girl to go. -(coughing) -Ms. Evans, I think -we need an escort. -Sending them in, sir. DIES: Gentlemen? I think it's time to leave, folks. Thank you for confirming our suspicions, Congressman. Mr. Houseman... ...what's it you people like to say in the theater? Break a leg? ORSON: Fight like you mean it, gentlemen, I wanna see the heat off your faces, the sparks off your swords. I need to believe that you're trying to kill each other, just-- fight like you mean it, damn it! (grunts) That real enough for ya? Maurice, just... Is somebody whistling in the theater? Nobody whistles in a theater, never! Do you understand? We don't need any more bad luck! My knee, it hurts like the devil. Well, get it checked. (slow jazz playing) Excuse me, how are you-- Get off me, Christ! I-I'm not queer! I don't care what you do in your bedroom. Just-- I-I don't want to see it in my theater. I'm-I'm a national champion, damn it. You know what would happen to my career if-if people found out I was a pansy? ♪ You want us to wear Black makeup? It's supposed to be set in the Haitian jungle. For it to be authentic, everyone needs to look like they're dark-skinned. Oh, come on, Orson, am I not authentically -Black enough? -It's not about you, Jack. It's about the fucking play! Wh... What would be best for the play is for you to get your head on straight. ♪ ORSON: Barry, take a step to your right. Nother right. Nother right. Perfect. ORSON (whispering): The castle of Macduff I will surprise... (continues whispering) The castle of Macduff I will surprise; give to the edge o' the sword, his wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls that trace him in his line. No more boasting like a fool. This deed I'll do before the purpose cool. The castle of Macduff I will surprise... Time! Again! Birnam Woods marching inexorably against the castle! You're supposed to be a highly trained military army. Just-- And I could do this all night. Macbeth is not a villain. Lady M. really has to push him to murder Duncan. (sighs) One more for the road. Better not. I have a long night ahead of me. Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. (laughing) -(groans) -(sighs) (laughing) Mr. Welles. (retching) -Oh... -I'm sorry, Mr. Welles... -ORSON: Unhand me! -...but we need to clean the elevator, would you mind? ORSON: I would mind very much. And I want you to take me upstairs... I want to see my wife. -Thank you. -Sir. Sir, she's right there. Virginia... Virginia? Virginia! Virginia? Oh... just... VIRGINIA: You're just a drunk, like your father. Oh, Virginia... (Orson chuckles) (rattling knob) ORSON: Virginia, I have to work. (groans) I'm tired. So am I. I'm tired of being nothing but a furnishing to you. ORSON: Just let me in, I... We'll talk. All you care about is that damn play. Today was my first day of filming, you knew how important it was to me, I reminded you over and over. You promised to be there, but... you chose to go out drinking. I had to talk to one of my actors. Yeah? Who? Edna? You know what? I don't even care. This has become just somewhere for you to sleep. Nothing else. Well, this is New York City. There are a million places for you to sleep. This is no longer one of them. Vir-- Virginia! You don't know anything about sacrifice! What you have to give up for your art! -Virginia! -(knocking on door) (knocking on door) Oh... (panting) I heard a voice cry, "Sleep no more!" Macbeth does murder sleep. (exhales) There you are. Are you ready for this preview? We've got about 50 people out there, including Percy Hammond, from the Star Tribune. I'll be out in a minute. (breathing heavily) Damn'd be he who cries, "Hold, enough!" Macbeth... Macbeth... be bloody, bold, and resolute. Laugh to scorn the power of man, for none of woman born shall harm Macbeth. Then what need I fear of thee, Macduff? ("thunder" rumbling) WITCH: Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until great Birnam Wood shall come to Dunsinane Hill. Good... Go... (mutters) That can never be... WITCHES: Seek to know no more. Jack-- I swear to God, Jack, -(panicked whispering) -Orson... I'm the understudy, shall I go on? God, no. I can't send on a queen for a king. Cuba, you're on! The top scene is next, go! -Move, move, move. -Your castle is surprised, your wife and babes savagely slaughtered. (stifling sobs) Not... in the legions of horrid hell... can come a devil more damn'd in evils... to top Macbeth. (whispering to self) Out, damned spot! Out, I say! One... two... (exhales) Why, then, 'tis time to do it. Fie, my lord, fie! A soldier, and afeard? (coughing) Yet... who would have thought the old man to have so much blood in him? What, will these hands ne'er be clean? (sniffs) Here's the smell of the blood, still, all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh... Oh... I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried. He cannot come out on's grave. (bell chiming) To bed! To bed! What's done cannot be undone. To bed. To bed... (coughing) (continues coughing) (bell chiming) That's our cue, let's go. Go! The queen is dead, my lord. ORSON: She should have died hereafter. There would have been time for such a word. Tomorrow... and tomorrow... and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools -the way to dusty death. -(background chatter) (whispering): Get him off the stage! Mr. Houseman! Out... Out, brief candle. Life's but a walking shadow... -Rose. (whispering) -...a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage... Close the bloody curtain! ...it is a tale told by an idiot... ...full of sound and fury... signifying nothing. (whispering): Peter, what the hell?! Rose fainted. She's over there. What the hell are you doing? (footsteps) (clears throat) Our apologies, ladies and gentlemen. Due to technical difficulties, this is the conclusion of tonight's preview performance. Move, move. I need you to make a path! Move, move! Get out of the way! Move, damn it! Stay back, guys, move, move! ♪ I'm not coming back here if he's gonna work in blackface! (chanting): Close it down! Close it down! Close it down! Close it down! (chanting continues) (chanting continues) Any of you touch a member of this company, I will put you down! They were wrong in there. You'd make a great Scottish king. (panting) (continues panting) (groaning) Oh, sh... Sh... Yeah, yeah... (groans) Son of a bitch! (panting) (muttering to self) Percy Hammond. Congressman Dies would like a word. DIES: Hello, Mr. Hammond? Come on aboard. What you thinking about? (sighs) I'm gonna cut to the chase, Percy. I'm gonna give you $300 in cash. Now, all you have to do... is write a review that that play was an abomination. (chuckling) Clearly, you haven't seen the play. Why do you say that? 'Cause if you had, you wouldn't have felt the need to pay me. (laughing) I think that's all, Percy. Thank you, sir. Orson? -Orson! -(groaning) What the hell happened?! What the fuck? Lift up your shirt. Oh, get off. (groans) Do what you're told, for once! Fortunately, it's not too deep. (groaning) I've just been reading the reviews. (groaning) Any raves? (both laughing) Uh... Percy Hammond wrote, "Deluxe boondoggling. "A vanity production, squandering taxpayer dollars." (laughing) Blackface? The hell were you thinking? It was a shit show. I had to try and save it. (exhales) Yeah. You made it worse. -Ah... -There. Now... hold that tight. Aah... fuck. (laughing) Did you know... ...Martin Dies is using this production as a... political stepping stone? He managed to get our funding cut off. Rose and I had to cover payroll last week. I'll manage to scrape up the funds myself. We have no time. No lead cast. And the rest of the cast won't bloody work with you anymore! Don't quit on me now, John! You chose me for a reason! As God is my witness, Orson... ...you get your act together. Or I will never work with you again. And I daresay no one else will, either. Now, get yourself cleaned up. Where are you going? (sighs) To the Federal Theatre Project. To try and get our funding back. (groaning) (door closes) (grunting) (screams) (Rose coughing) (Orson grunts softly) How was that for dramatic flair? You promised me a geyser of blood. -(coughing) -(Orson chuckling) Next time. I'm so sorry, Rose. Have you ever wanted something so badly you'd do anything... ...and I mean anything, to make it happen? -I hired you, didn't I? -(soft chuckle) I let you down, Rose. When we first met, I called you a petulant child. (chuckles) Petulant, yes. But a child? I've never been that. When your mother dies young, your childhood dies with her. And your father? Kept busy. Brandy, mostly. And one illness or another. Kicked the bucket in a puddle of piss and a hail of obscenities. I was 15. I saw this play unfold in my head. Rose, it was so clear. Now... I'm watching its demise. As much as I despise many of your methods, you're not without talent. A lot of people are relying on you. Cast. Crew. (coughing) A whole community. It's not too late to fix this. I'm not sure I know how. So? Let's talk. (coughing) (door closes) Orson Welles' grand production of the Scottish play is dead. But your Scottish play is alive and well. The one that belongs to Cuba. To Maurice. To Edna. And to all of you. The play that belongs to Rose. I just came from the hospital. And while she will not be able to move forward with us... ...Rose wanted me to make sure that her vision of a Negro Shakespeare production comes to reality. I'm not about to apologize for all my transgressions. Too numerous to count. I will say... that I understand what a privilege it is to be here with each of you. And I am aware of the reason why I hired you all. Because you're good. I need to trust you. I need to trust your instincts. I need to stop trying to force you to my will. So let us press forward and make Rose's dream come true. Edna... you're our new Lady M. And Maurice... ...you are our new king. Let's get to work. Act One, Scene One. -(door opens) -Ah! Yeah, refreshments on the table up here. Everyone, please help yourselves, and don't worry, it's not tuna. (soft chatter) Orson... thank you for your vote and confidence, -but I cannot accept. -Why not? The day you hired me, you expressed having feelings for me. Now you offer me this role? I don't want those feelings to be-- My behavior was inappropriate. I offer you the role purely because of your talent. I can't imagine anyone replacing Rose but you. Shall we get back to rehearsal, Lady M.? (laughter) (distant train rattling) (distant drumming) (scattered applause) -(whoops) -(applause) (smooth drumming rhythm) (tentative rhythm) -(smooth rhythm) -ONLOOKER: Ooh, yeah! (applause) Feel the drumbeats in your bones. Remember, it's a battle. Take it from your entrance, Cuba. Swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn, brandish'd by man that's of a woman born. Tyrant, show thy face. Turn, hellhound, turn! Of all men else, I have avoided thee. CUBA: I have no words. My voice is in my sword. Excellent, gentlemen, take a break. Take a break, take a break! Cuba, a word? Having trouble with that left eye? Hell no. Nothing wrong with my eye. Cut the bullshit, Cuba. I study people for a living. Look, I was good. I was good. Till a slugger near popped my eye out. Now, I only win when the promoter pays the other fella to take a dive. Look, I make 'em a lot of money because of my stage presence. I'm a fraud, Orson. A big, brawny liar. Have you told anyone else? No. That's your truth to tell. Cuba... Take a minute, hmm? Rest that knee up. Yes, sir. All right, we're back! Restore! (bell rings) -Flowers for Mrs. Welles? -Oh, thank you. "The love that follows us sometime "is our trouble... ...which still we thank as love." Better late than never. A quote from the Haitian play. Of course. MAN: Virginia, you're up. (exhales) MAN: Places, everyone! Quiet on the set! Ninety-apple, take two, marker! (chanting): No place for blackface! No place for blackface! No place for blackface! (chanting continues) (chanting continues) (distant chatter) Mr. Welles! Mr. Welles! No running in the theater! -Do you know your lines? -Every one. Good. How's your mama? Scared. Do you want to know a secret? (whispering) -Thou shalt be... -Mr. Welles told me -he's scared, too. -(sighs) I told her it's all just pretend. It's not that simple, honey. It is, actually. It's good to be scared. Keeps you sharp. I brought you something. It's not from me. "You were born to play this role. Love, Rose." (exhales) (whispering): ...done, then 'twere well it were done quickly; if the assassination... I'm always nervous 'fore I land the first punch. Hit me. You're hurt. Hardly a fair fight. Go on. I know you want to. Hit me. (breathing heavily) Harder. Again. Harder. (wailing) (sobbing) I don't think I can play this part. No, no, no, no, no... You're not playing at anything. You are a king. You should get dressed. Right. You were wearing a red tie in public? That's right. You know, in some circles, they say men that wear a red tie... -are attracted to-- -Gentlemen! Cuba, how's the knee? Oh, if there's one thing I can tolerate, it's pain. Maurice? I'm terrified. Perfect. So am I. Hmm? (audience chatter) This sure is something, this thing we do. Shut your eyes and listen. They've come to sit in the dark and be told a story. Theater is like a campfire. And we are like storytellers of old, sharing history. Traditions. Myths. You feel at home here, huh? (chuckles) My wife would tell you it's my only true home. And if we fail tonight... ...that would spell the first round knockout of the myth of Orson Welles. But when we succeed... our myth will blaze like a firestorm. (Orson chuckles) You think that reviewer's out here again? Didn't you hear? Our friend Percy at The Herald died last night. -Massive heart attack. -It must be the curse. Reckon he said the M-word in our theater. Don't touch me! I don't need no goddamn ticket! I'm cast! You know who I am? (sighs) MAN: Five minutes till curtain. No trouble at all, Jack. Oh, John. You can have this seat here. Hands on me like I ain't-- I'm somebody! (grunts) (whispering indistinctly) Heard about your pathetic begging at the FTP. Well... you got your big night. -Hmm. -I can guarantee you that... if this is a travesty, which I'm sure it is... ...it'll be your last. Yeah. Good evening to you, too, Congressman. (bell chiming) (drums playing) (drumming continues) WITCH: When shall we three meet again? In thunder, lightning, or in rain? WITCH 2: When the hurlyburly's done, when the battle's lost and won. WITCHES: Fair is foul, and foul is fair. Hover through the fog and filthy air. A drum! A drum. Macbeth doth come. (witches cackling) What are you? Speak, if you can! All hail Macbeth... that shalt be king hereafter. ("thunder" rumbles) -(whispering to self) -CLARISSA: Macbeth, be bloody, bold, -and resolute. -It is, uh... Two minutes, Mrs. Thomas. Come on, Mommy. You're gonna be magnificent. -(drums playing) -(indistinct voices on stage) (Orson whispering) MAURICE: Stars, hide your fires! Let not light see my black and deep desires. If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me without my stir. My dearest partner of greatness. What tidings, my noble lord? The weird sisters saluted me, "Hail, king that shalt be." This, I thought good to deliver thee. JACK: That thou mightst not lose... BOTH: ...the dues of rejoicing, at what greatness is promised thee! -I am Macbeth! (grunting) -(woman gasps) That's right, I said it! I whistled, too! Bad luck! (cackles) Bad luck! I am Macbeth! (fading into distance): I whistled, too! (whispering): Thou shalt be what thou art promised. Thou shalt be what thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature. It is too full of the milk of human kindness. Look like the innocent flower, my thane, but be the serpent under it. (soft drumming) There's 10,000 English soldiers, sir! The spirits have pronounced, "Fear not, Macbeth." John, have you seen Virginia? Not yet. (sighs) Put mine armor on. I'll fight till, from my bones, my flesh be hack'd. I will not be afraid of death and bane, till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane. As I stood watch upon the hill, I looked towards Birnam, and anon, methought the woods began to move. If thou speak'st false, upon the next tree shall thou hang alive. Siward is sick. He's in the bathroom moaning. -He can't go on. -Holy hell. Uh... Barry, you're on. You're Siward. What? No. I-I-I don't know the lines. You haven't let me say a word. It's three lies. Somebody, get him a script. Now a wood comes towards Dunsinane. -Ring the alarum bell! -(bell chimes) Blow... wind! Come, wrack! At least we'll die with harness on our back. Just... Just pretend Maurice is me. Go! What is thy name? Thou'lt be afraid to hear it. My name's Macbeth. Ah, the devil himself cannot pronounce a title -more hateful to mine ear. -No! Nor more fearful. With my sword, abhorred tyrant, I'll prove I have no fear of you. (laughing) MAURICE: I bear a charmed life. Which must not yield to one of woman born. (chuckling) Macduff was from his mother's womb untimely ripped. MAURICE: Accursed be the tongue that tells me so. I will not fight with thee. I know you are not about to tell me to sit down, Orson Welles. MAURICE: I will not yield! Lay on, Macduff! And damn'd be him that first cries, "Hold, enough!" (both grunting) (both grunting) AUDIENCE MEMBER: Kill the tyrant! -Kill! -Kill the tyrant! (audience shouting) (both grunting) Aah! (grunts) (groaning) -MAN: Bravo! -(cheering and applause) Yeah! Yeah! Macbeth is dead! Yeah! (cheering) Yeah! (cheering and applause continue) VIRGINIA: All hail the king. You're here. Not your most intelligent observation. May I? They just brought the house down. Why aren't you in there? This is their show now. Modesty, Mr. Welles. (exhales) I'm not sure it suits you. The only thing we wholly own... are our failures. It's good. You know, you might just be the artist I thought I married after all. What's next? I don't know. A film? Oh, yeah? You think the movies will ever replace the radio? (distant chatter) Congratulations, Orson. (Orson exhales) Now, I want to go enjoy that celebration, even if you don't want to. After all... it was my idea. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ -(rattle shaking) -(soft drumbeat) ♪ REPORTER: The Negro Theater Unit of the Federal Theatre Project produced a highly-successful version of Shakespeare's immortal tragedy Macbeth, which far exceeded its scheduled run in New York and was later sent on a tour of the country. The scene was changed from Scotland to Haiti, but the spirit of Macbeth and every line in the play has remained intact. In this contribution to the American theater, and in other projects under the Works program, we have set our feet on the road toward a brighter future. And I care not if thou dost for me as much. "Fear not, till Birnam Wood do come to Dunsinane," and now a wood comes toward Dunsinane. (triumphant music) Arm, arm, and out! There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here! I 'gin to be aweary of the sun, and wish the estate o' the world were now undone! Ring the alarum-bell! -(clanging) -(trumpet blaring) Blow, wind! Come, wrack! At least we'll die with harness on our backs! What's he that was not born of woman? Such a one am I to fear, or none. Let me find him, fortune. Tyrant, show thy face! I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms are hired to bear their staves. If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine, my wife and children's ghost will haunt me still! What is thy name? (explosion) (cackling) My name's Macbeth! Turn, hellhound, turn! Of all men else, I have avoided thee, but get thee back; my soul is too much charged with blood of thine already! Then yield thee, coward, and live to be the show and the gaze o' time. We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are, painted upon a pole, and underwrit, "Here may you see the tyrant"! I will not yield! Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane, yet I will try the last! I have no words! (explosions) Lay on, Macduff. And damn'd be he who first cries, "Hold, enough!" (cackling) Thou losest labor, for I bear a charmed life, which must not yield to one of woman born. Despair thy charm! And let the angel whom thou still hast served tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb -untimely ripp'd. -(witches cackling) Accursed be the tongue that tells me so! Aah! And be these juggling fiends... no more believed. (screaming, wailing) Hail, king! (music and drums) ALL: Hail, king!
