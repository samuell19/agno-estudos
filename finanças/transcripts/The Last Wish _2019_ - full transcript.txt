Okay. In the future, if you want to pee, just tell Mom. The Last Wish My name is Xu Hao. I'm a high school student at a loose end. That idiot is Zhang Zhengyang, a north easterner who transferred to our class in the second year of junior middle school. I called him Brother Yang for two weeks. - Layup! - It turned out that he wasn't very mean. Then I let him be my little brother. Unexpectedly, he agreed. From then on, we were always together until we graduated from high school. We are called Xu Hao Trio. We were like peas and carrots every day. Except to go home and sleep, we were always together. - My Jordan. - Yes, you're hearing me correctly. It's Trio. Since primary school, Gao Yuan and I were in the same class. He's introverted and likes to play basketball too. Why did your blood pressure increase? How is it? It's fine. Later, after going to high school, he got sick. He has been in hospital for two years. Come in. You two come here almost every day and always bring something every time you come. Don't lavish money any more. Aunt, you're entirely welcome. How can we come empty-handed? It's not expensive to buy some drinks. We can save some pocket money. Anyway, the college entrance examination is over. Our scores are still unknown. Now, we have nothing to do anyway. Sit down. Nurse Mi. There you are. Hello, sister Mi. Aunt, the doctor asked you to go to the office. Mom, you go first. We will stay by ourselves. Okay. Aunt, take care. Okay, I will. Is there anything to eat? What's wrong with your hair? You're able to tell? Is it so obvious? Tinfoil perm. It's the most popular nowadays. I tell you, today I got my hair done. Let me tell you something interesting. Look at his hair. He didn't want to cut too much, so he told the barber to cut a little less. Well, they really did cut less. They even cut the temples. You should tell the barber to cut a little off. - One more word. - I told you not to touch my hair. So what? I touched it. - Take your hands off me. - You take your hands off me! - It doesn't hurt. - It doesn't hurt me either. It hurts me even less. Take your hands off me. Did you hear me? Gao Yuan, when will your illness be healed? Zhang Zhengyang, - didn't you ask your father? - I asked him. My dad said he seems to have a nervous or muscular atrophy. He can't move right? I could move before. Now, my body, hands, and feet gradually can't move. If one day, you can't move your head either, will you become a vegetable? Will you die? I don't know either. It's not easy to die. He has been laying here for two years and didn't die. That's right. You're so young. You will not die. Now, he is increasingly unable to control his muscles. Urinary incontinence. It's also a manifestation of the deterioration of the disease. We've been pals for years. There's no need to beat around the bush. The current situation, is really a lot worse than before. You'd better prepare yourselves at any moment. Dad, I'm sleepy. Dad, where's my mom? She's not feeling well. I'll be with you tonight. Son, are you asleep? Not yet. Do you... Do you have any wishes? What? If you have any wishes, just tell Dad. Dad, you're back. Dad, look. I have grown up. From now on, before you come in, can you knock on the door first? Yes. Grown up. Grown up. Also, Dad, can you give me some more money? How much? - Two hundred. - How much? Didn't... didn't you let me say it myself? I just gave you one hundred yesterday. It's been spent in one day. Yesterday, I went to visit Gao Yuan. You can visit him more often when you have time. Dude, thanks. You're too generous! Will this highlight be cocky? No biggie. Something happened. What's up? There is something wrong. There is definitely something wrong. You see, I told my dad I was going to see Gao Yuan. My dad gave me more money. He also told me to visit him more often. What does he mean? What does he mean? What do you mean, "What does he mean"? You can't tell? My dad must have taken money from Gao Yuan's family. He's my brother, and my dad can even take his money. Disregard. No wonder he is so rich. Get his hair permed with the most expensive tints. Sure. Stop! Teacher Xia, what are you doing? You even got highlights? What color is this? You even got the tinfoil perm. Is it one-off or permanent? Hurry and make it straight again. Indecent. You don't look like a student at all. Teacher Xia, we both graduated. Graduated. So what? With your scores you must repeat third year. If you really want to dye, just dye a strand of hair. Also, how many times have I told you? I resigned and I'm not a teacher now. From now, don't call me teacher. - Got it? - Ok, Brother Yu. Son. Do you have any wishes? What's up? Yesterday my dad asked me too. Oh, it's fine. We're just asking casually. It's a nice day today. Very comfortable, right? Come here. Sit down and have a rest. Dad, why are we running? You'll know why soon. It took so long to prepare. Just for this day. Come on. Come on. Ready! Go! Go! Go! Go! Son, are you happy? How do you feel? Do you feel a puff of wind passing your ears? Do you feel the sun shining on you? Go! Go! Go! Go! This route is chosen by the long distance runner. The air is good here. Come on. Take a deep breath with Dad. Come on. Deep breathing. Go! Go! Dad. Dad. M-my son. Don't talk. Just lie down. Dad. Dad. Help! Is anybody there? Dad. This evening, enthusiastic citizen Mr. Wang found a man tied to a wheelchair in a ditch somewhere in our city. He's a disabled teenager. The teenager is now being taken to hospital for treatment. As for why the teenager was abandoned here, the exact reason is still unknown. Is it the distortion of human nature or moral evil? We will continue to follow up and report it. Gao Yuan was abandoned? Go. Let's go and have a look. Brother and instant noodles, I hesitated. Zhang Zhengyang, hurry up. We were taken aback. Is Uncle okay? He's fine. Just tired. That's good. Then let's go and take a look at Gao Yuan. Wait. If you have time these days, come and see him more often. Chat with him. After all, you're best friends. He hasn't been very well lately. I don't know the details either. How much time will he have left? What are you looking at? Nothing. We just suddenly feel like you're very handsome. - You're mad! - You're the one who's mad! Um. Sleep well. Stay in bed as much as possible. Take more rest. We're leaving. Gao Yuan. What now? You... Do you have any wishes? How come you guys also... A brother with whom I grew up. Is he really dying? What is death? Many people say that they are going to another place. Is this a comfort to oneself? They dare not admit that death is disappearance. It's because there's a lot of reluctance about leaving the world. There's a lot of things that were left undone. Will he have many regrets? What can I do for him? How about this? Play basketball. Going to the beach. Do you remember? We said before that we were going to rush into the sea together. This is our oath. We're going to achieve it together. Sea of youth. Do you remember? This feeling. - How about it? - Let's go. Take him to fulfill our oath. I know a place. It's very beautiful. You two. Hold tightly. Don't let him fall. I'm holding him. Where on earth are we going? Taking you to the beach of youth. Yeah! It's hard. Your strength can be regarded as assaulting police. Uncle, I was wrong. Uncle, we really know that we were wrong. We'll let you go because you have a patient. Don't let it happen again. Thank you, Uncle. What should we do? They don't allow three people on the motorcycle at once. Well. Go! Sea, we're coming. You guys hate to part with me? You begrudge me, right? How did it become extreme sports? I'm temporarily withholding the ID. Call your parents to pick you up. Uncle, it's actually like this. True brothers! Da Kuan, Da Guang, and Da Yu, I miss you. Since separated from police school, we never met again. Go. Let me show you the way. I'm so touched. I'm really touched. Help me wipe the tears. Look. The sea! Come on! Come on, you guys. Thank you. Is this beautiful? How about we pick some up. - Hey, you guys... - Here we go. One, two, three. - Sea, we're coming. - Sea, we're coming. Gao Yuan. Gao Yuan. Gao Yuan, it's all right. It's just a rough start. Hey, pal, can you make it? Take the wheelchair away. Sea! Are you happy? It's digging into my feet. You try it. Okay, let me have a try! Are you happy? Hold on! Are you happy? I just had an accident. My feet gave out. How about we do it together? It will be safer. Okay. It's the sea. Sea! I'm out of breath. I'm shagged out too! Then what about our oath to rush into the sea? Dude, how about... How about we try again? Come on, carry him on your back. Let's be more devoted. Okay. Sea, we're coming. Sea, we're coming. Yeah! Sea! Here we are! - Sea. - Sea. Where is Gao Yuan? - Gao Yuan! - Gao Yuan! Gao Yuan! We're coming. Why is this different from what I thought? Shut up! Why don't we try again? You shut up. Excuse me, is it still open? We want to wash his hair. Come in. Those two are your classmates? My best friends. We grew up together. Why can't you move? Because I got sick for several years. Will it be healed? I don't know. You're so hot. I'm okay. Hello? He has a fever. Son! Mom, I'm quite all right. Aunt, I'm sorry. Aunt, I'm sorry. You can hit again. It's okay! Let's go home first before talking. Why did you bring him here? Why? And you, why did you go long distance running for no reason? What are you trying to do? What is it that you are trying to do? Have mercy on us. My dad is seriously ill. My dad is sick. Have mercy on us. Please do us a favor. Good people live a safe life. Please, please. Please. Lao Zhang, Lao Zhang. I'm tired. Let's change roles. Give me some money. My son is sick. Give me some money. My son is sick. Give me some money. Youngster, what are you doing? - Get up. - I can't move. - I asked you to get up. - My son is sick. Can't you move, right? Then don't move. Can you move or not? You can stand. Why did you pretend to lie down? Stop! Stop! You can stand. Why did you pretend to lie down? Stop! Stop! You can stand. Why did you pretend to lie down? You can stand. Why did you pretend to lie down? You can stand. Why did you pretend to lie down? You can stand. Why did you pretend to lie down? You can stand! You can stand! You can stand! Aunt, we're so sorry. Aunt. We miss Gao Yuan. Come in. You two, don't fool around anymore. Did you hear me? You seem a little thinner. Um, did the fever go away? Do you feel better now? About taking you to the seaside... How could I be so stingy? You scared me. You know? You see. I told you Gao Yuan is not such a stingy person. - Are you thinking too much? - I didn't. - Are you thinking too much? - It's okay. It's all right. When I get better, let's go again. Okay. When you get better, let's go. You guys, don't pretend. I can tell. I'm going to die. Zhang Zhengyang, is it true? What? I can tell already. All of a sudden, everyone asked me what wishes I had. My dad exercises for no reason. He took me to a long-distance race. You two stole me out and took me to the beach. You... don't die so early. Give up on smoking later. You'll get lung cancer. I have something to tell you. My parents... You two take care of their old age for me. For myself, I have another wish. I... I.. Come on, tell us. You tell us, we will help you to achieve it. I want that. I want to fall in love. What are you talking about? To be frank, I have been sick for so long. I know it in my own heart. If I encountered it, I can't do anything anyway, right? I just think I'm just not willing. Not willing? I always feel that I haven't grown up yet. If I have to die, at least I should become a grown man first. If you haven't fallen in love yet, how can you say you've grown up? I haven't even held a girl's hand. I don't know why. When sleeping, when getting up in the morning, or when smelling the fragrance on the nurse, I feel that my body can move again. Can you understand the feeling? If you want, just do it. We will help you. Really? Help? How? We can find a girlfriend for him. Right? It's a piece of cake. You'll really help me? You wait here. - Let's go. - Wait. Let's go. Xu Hao. Do it by your standards. I know. Your standards? We are both from poor households. Who can we go to? Then how about Zhang Linlin? She's a good girl. And she hasn't been in love. If they are put together, how long will it take to bond with each other? Then how about Li Ru? Don't talk nonsense. She has a boyfriend. The principal's son. He's taller than you and smarter than me. Then Wang Xuanxuan will do, right? She's pretty. And she's dated before. But she never fed the stray cat in our school. What? How can that be? She has no love at all. How can she date? Well, let's cast a wide net first. Start with old classmates. But there must be requirements. Be kind, generous, and good at dating. I got it. I got it. We have been classmates for three years. I didn't beg you for anything. Well, forget it. I'll go first. Wait. You've been sitting all afternoon with your classmates in your arms. You're making me a little curious about it. If you don't tell me, I won't let you go today. I heard that you're quite casual in love. Your acne has gotten worse. Have you ever thought to eliminate it? Just take it as a love offering. Um... What are you doing? I haven't spoken yet. They told me when I see you, beat you first. How's it going? I asked everyone, even Wang Xiaoyue. Are you crazy? You even asked her? She was your first love. Not first love, just unrequited love. She didn't know. What do you mean? Did you ask He Huan? I—that's the front page of my classmates. Front page. Just in case. Brother! All right, stop it. Are you a good enough friend? I'm asking you, are you a good enough friend? I received a letter from your mother. Then I know your situation. I heard that you like basketball very much. Yes. I used to play it frequently. Gao Yuan, let's stick to the end. Don't give up. Believe in yourself. Yes. And do you want to watch the game? I will take you to the court to watch the game. No, thank you. I'll just watch TV. I... It's not very convenient. Then let's make a deal. We're going to win this game for you. When you watch us on TV, be sure to cheer us on, will you? Okay? Sure. - Cheer up! - Cheer up! Gao Yuan said before that he hasn't even held a girl's hand. What did he mean? Did we focus too much on spiritual pursuits before? Falling in love also includes the body movements of kissing, cuddling, and being picked up. You're right. We should change our minds. Let him and a girl have opportunities for physical contact. Feelings can be cultivated slowly. However, there's no hope with old classmates. Physical contact. I got it. Alas. It doesn't work again. That's for sure. Who is willing to date Gao Yuan in this kind of situation? No one can offer love like this. These massage therapists are not willing to come to the door. Or let's ask your sister? - What did you say? - That's not what I meant. How dare you bring up my sister as an idea? That's my sister. Sister. Can you do health care? Dad! - Sister. No, sister. - Dad! Sister, listen to me. Physiotherapy. I'm talking about physiotherapy. Sister, listen to me. No, sister. Dad, dad, dad. Stop! In my family, there's no room for me. You did your best. I take the blame. Stop crying first. Now, let's ask Bateer to tell us what he thinks about the victory today. Thank you to my coach and my teammates. Today we worked together to win the game. But, more importantly, I want to talk to a teenager who watched the live broadcast on TV now. A teenager? Gao Yuan, are you there? I have fulfilled our appointment. Gao Yuan, I know you're watching the TV. You have to stick it out to the end. You must be fated to live. How about it? It's almost ready. Very soon. You wait. Actually, I don't have to do that either. Last time you asked me what I wanted, I just said it casually. You... You obviously look forward to it. I'm not looking forward to it. Do you know how much effort we have spent? I... Dreamt of kissing a girl yesterday. What should we do? What you said... is impossible. The girl still has to have a bit of affection, unlike us. Do you remember the fat girl in the next class when we were in junior high school? We called her Sima Gang. She liked Gao Yuan so much. At that time, she followed us everyday. If we wanted to have a good meal at noon, we would have to rely on her. If it weren't for her appearance, would Gao Yuan still have this wish today? Well, Gao Yuan doesn't like her at all. In this situation, will he still be choosy? Then, can you find her? I should be able to. Ask her out and have a try. What if she will? I'm thinner than before. You changed a lot. At that time, you... you liked Gao Yuan, don't you? He is now... Xu Hao, do you know why I followed Gao Yuan around every day at that time? Because when I was with him, I could see you. In fact, you're the one I liked. I'm very happy that you ask me out today. I thought you forgot me. In the past few years, I have been thinking about you every day. I know you didn't like fat girls like me, so I wanted to make myself better. For you, I liked basketball. For you, I lost weight. For you, I grew my hair long. For you, I was willing to do anything. You... Anything? Then, can you be Gao Yuan's girlfriend? Zhang Zhengyang. I regret it. You were so handsome just now! It's you guys who bully my sister. Brother, who is your sister? Sima Gang. Wouldn't it be fine if you just date Sima Gang? Why do you have to involve Gao Yuan in this? She's beautiful, and she has a mean brother. Most importantly, it's none of my business at all. Why beat me? Okay. Do you think I don't regret it? Sima Gang is so beautiful now. Do you have any money with you? Look, where can I store money on me? What shall we do then? You're asking me? It's all your fault. That's the new Nike my dad bought for me. For this matter, I don't want to be like this. Hey, girl. Your bag. Run! Stop! Stop! Stop! - Come down. - It's not me. - You've got the wrong person. - I'm not a bad guy. There's another one. There's another one over there. Catch up! Stop! Go. I'm not a bad person. This midnight when the police were patrolling somewhere in the city, they captured two naked teenagers who were assaulting a woman and planning to commit robbery. Is the emergence of such a younger-aged crime the distortion of human nature or moral evil? We will continue to follow up and report it. We are victims. Go in. Be honest. Dad, stop. Ow! Dad! I thought I could escape it. But who would've thought that he would hit me on the temple? Fantastic. The whole world is red. If we continue to try to find someone in this way, we won't be able to hold up soon. Don't be sad. We have to get out of the pain and look for hope. Yesterday, the stroke of genius at my temple brought a great inspiration to me. We can go through the acupoints to stimulate his brain nerves. Thus, it can produce the feeling of the first love. Do you know what you're talking about? This is the secret of martial arts, I found from my dad's VCD cabinet last night. It is easy to attack a vital point. But it's difficult to identify the acupoints. Not only do you need to see where it is, but you also need to integrate the finger and heart. We need to stimulate the brain. Yesterday I tested it personally. It really was sensitive. That's what we'll have to do. It's worth a try. Then, you try it. I'll teach you. No. Then I don't want to do it either. Then, as always. As always. - Rock, paper, scissors, shoot! - Rock, paper, scissors, shoot! Aunt is not here, right? We ended up like this. Will he be disappointed? Disappointed for what? We're in this situation now. Now, there's really no other way. Anyway, it's better than him peeing himself. Suddenly, I can't take it. Let's admit defeat for bet. His first love depends on you. Be accurate when you attack the vital point. Hello, Uncle. Tell me, what does Gao Yuan really want to do? Tell me. Gao Yuan. He said he wanted to do... do something. He said... He said he wanted... To "fall in love". What? Fall in love. He wants to fall in love. He didn't want to die with regrets. He wants to be an adult. Does his mother know about this? No. It's a secret between us three brothers. Uncle, what else do you want to know? I'll tell you. Uncle, how about we go first? Bye, Uncle. Let's go. What should we do? The secret was revealed. My dad's secret of martial arts was confiscated by Uncle. If we really can't find the person, let's find a fake one. What about finding someone to act as his girlfriend? Eh, how did you come up with that? I thought of it just now. But, we don't know any actresses. Where can we find them? We don't need to find actresses. We will go wherever there are beautiful girls. Cabaret Disco. How about this? I'll get two adult outfits first. You go back and ask for some money. See you later. And it's a secret between us. You must keep it secret. Okay. Have you ever been here? No, it seems that the money is not enough either. When you go in later, don't order fruit platter. I know. I know. I've been to all the Karaoke in this district. Teacher Xia. Wait for a moment. I'll show my voice to you. I'm familiar with this place, too. Xu Hao, Zhang Zhengyang. Tell me, is that where you should go? Tell me, what have you done there? We can't tell you. Don't be so stubborn! You don't take me as your brother, right? Say or not? Say or not? Say or not? - Say, say. - Brother Yu, stop! - We... - Shut up! Don't embarrass him. Don't embarrass whom? Who? You, come here. - Me again? - Come here. I'll ask you again. Tell me or not? You tell me. Brother Yu, I dare not. I don't dare any further! Hurry up! Who? What are you doing? Why are you biting down on your tongue? No, why are you biting your tongue? Stop it. Stop it. I'm afraid I can't help but say it out. Teacher Xia. What have you been up to lately? Nothing. Don't worry, It's almost ready. I'm not in a hurry. Well, I mean, if you are free these days, I want to go to the seaside again. What? I want to go there to wash my hair or do something else. Let's fight for it again. Boss, here's the rice. I'll take this one. Now that's the way it is. We can see that Gao Yuan likes you very much. We have no other way. If you are willing, I hope you can come that day. Because on that night, only Gao Yuan's father will be there. You are our only hope. We hope you will come to accompany him. We... Sister, smoke less. It will cause lung cancer. Oh! Thank you. What are you thinking about? It's not for you. I'm just lending it to you once. Only once. Loosen the shoelaces quickly. She still hasn't come yet? Then I'll go to the bathroom again. You say, if she doesn't come, what shall we do? If she doesn't come, what will Gao Yuan do? I ate the instant noodles. I'll give you back the comic once I finish reading it. The money you can take back. Where's Gao Yuan? I'll go and see him. You two go out. What are you doing? Let me go and listen. Knock it off. Zhang Zhengyang! Zhang Zhengyang, come back. Zhang Zhengyang, come back and sit down. Zhang Zhengyang! Xu Hao, it's so late. Why aren't you two going home? Aunt, why are you here? Only Uncle is supposed to be here tonight, right? I can't sleep. I wanted to come and see him. You guys hurry home. Aunt, Gao Yuan fell asleep. What if you go in and wake him up? Don't worry. I'll be quiet. Aunt. What's up? Aunt, I cannot feel my legs. I can't move. Then sit down and have a rest. Aunt, I'm feeling so bad. Then take a rest. Aunt! Leave it to me. What did I do just now? Take her to the hospital. This is the hospital. Wife. Wife! Sister, I'll never forget you. Sister. What's your name? I'll go first. You guys wait for a moment before going in. He is crying. Sister. Sister, if I'm sick too, will you come, right? How does that make you feel? Wonderful! How... How wonderful is it? You couldn't even imagine it. You're the first one to fall in love. I thought it would be me. Details, details. Details. Tell us. This is what Gao Yuan asked me to give you. You guys grow up soon, too. Grow up, so what? I will grow up soon. Gao Yuan, you wait and see. Sister? Little did I guess it would be you. Your friends brought me your favorite instant noodles. And your favorite cartoons. They... They're pretty cute. To help you realize your hope, they suffered a great deal. But... You're stronger than I thought. You're already a man. There's no need to prove it with anything else. - I... - Sister. In fact, that wish, I was just saying it. I dared not think that they... My health is getting worse. I don't want them to worry about me. They've been busy for so long. This has become their wish. I don't want to let them down. So what happened to us, just pretend it's done. I hope you keep it secret for me. This is my last wish. Dad and Mom, do you have any wishes? Us? We just want you to grow up healthily. Right. Do you guys have any wishes? Wishes? I haven't thought about it. What about you? My wish? I don't want to go to school. You're crazy. What kind of wish is that? - Who are you talking about? - You're crazy. You're crazy. What do you want to do if you don't want to go to school? You don't want to go to school, either. Thank you, Dad, the one who took me running. Thank you, Mom, the one who took good care of me. Thank you, everyone who accompanied me to the end. Thank you, kind little sister. Thank you, two crazy guys, for everything you've done for me. But I'm sorry. I lied to you. Actually, from the beginning, I knew that there was little time left for me. I said I pretended to be incontinent. In fact, that was true. I said I often had wet dreams. Actually, I lied to you. In the last moments, I didn't want to see you in my hospital room with your sad faces. I also didn't want to make you feel like I couldn't hold on anymore. We're brothers. No one wants to lose to one another. I deliberately put you guys on the spot to make you suffer the bitterness of flesh and make me happy. Keeping you busy like this would make time pass faster, right? Men should smile and hug when they say goodbye. But I'm sorry. I'll just say goodbye like this. ♫ Everyone has a group that doesn't separate in their hearts ♫ ♫ Just thinking about it makes them feel warm ♫ ♫ Those nights spent together ♫ ♫ turn into the oldest habit ♫ [Gao Yuan (1983-2002)] ♫ Say goodbye to me ♫ ♫ Don't be afraid, don't say anything that will be sad ♫ ♫ Say goodbye properly ♫ ♫ Before waving, promise me that we'll smile together, okay? ♫ ♫ Say goodbye to me ♫ ♫ Don't be afraid, don't say anything that will be sad ♫ ♫ Say goodbye properly ♫ ♫ Before waving, promise me that we'll smile together, okay? ♫ ♫ Say goodbye to me ♫ ♫ Don't let tears roll down your cheeks ♫ ♫ and wipe them quietly ♫ ♫ Say goodbye to me ♫ ♫ On the back of the photo, carefully wrote down the blessings ♫ Tell me, what the hell are you doing?
