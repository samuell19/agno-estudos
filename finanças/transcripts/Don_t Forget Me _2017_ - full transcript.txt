When can I shift to electric? Classic guitars have thick necks, to stretch your fingers, then you can switch to acoustic, electric, whatever you like. - No, he started already, I bought him an electric guitar, he's taking lessons and... Weissbach, remember me? I used to come in here. Weissbach is the name of the shop. I'm Amnon. Amnon, yes. I'm Neil. Remember I used to come here? Yes, sure... Ill be right with you...

Yes, it's not instead of... that's what I'm saying. -Yes. - Look, Dad... it's different. I like the sound of the electric, I like the... Now he's into rock and roll, chicks and all that. Rightfully so... Listen... he'll do it when... If he comes in to try a left handed so... Then I have to change it... -Okay. So we'll come again, alright? I'm here. I'm not going anywhere. - Okay. Thanks. - Thanks. Bye. Son? You want a tuba with a C pitch? Yes. Don't you remember me? Did you take lessons with my son? No, I studied at the conservatory in Amsterdam. You don't say. - You know it? I heard about it. It's a fine school. Yes. It's made of silver. Great finish. It's German. Yes, do you... do you "repareren" them too? What? Do you... fix tubas? Whoa... What happened to the poor thing? I haven't played in a long time. My mom bought it for me years ago. Look, a setup and cleaning, are 600 shekels, but do you see this? I have to order parts from abroad, You see? It's dead. Yes, I'm going to play in a band and then I'll have money for a new tuba, but... I'm going to play in a band. That's nice. -Yes, "Misogynists", Have you heard of them? No. They're very successful in Europe, America... Yes, I'm going to join them. Really? -Yes. How much does a tuba like this cost? That one? I can sell it to you for 22. That's a good price. Do you remember... do you know my mother? Mini? She... She's a redhead. We lived around the corner, in Tel Aviv. Can you give me a better price? You can pay me in installments. Even 30 installments, that should make it easier. Yes, the thing is... Thank you. How about credit? A card. Yes, that's what I mean. Yes, because... my dad, he gave me a card. When I came here he told me: "Neil, don't do anything stupid!" You want to ask him? Oh, yes, no, that's okay. I don't understand. No... I... I want to buy the tuba. And is it fine with your father? - Yes. Hey, Salman, can you move a little? Come on, I can't go like this. Can you move? A little? Please? Just a bit. Do what you need to do quietly. there's the regular walk that you see at most fashion weeks, like this... It's ordinary, but if you walk in heels then it's cool, because you can burn calories. Okay? Then there's the Victoria's Secret walk... where it's good there's something to wiggle... Then there's this cool music... Paris fashion week, it's the coldest. Pose... And Miami is the best, bathing suits and heels, it's good for burning fat on the sides, with this vitality in the face. Are you watching? Like this... tanned. Pose... Aren't you tired of being cynical? How about trying something new? Last night I felt like I was about to die, like I'm supposed to get my period and take a shit at the same time, like something is about to come out of my stomach and then my life will be over. Then I had to pee and I discovered I got my period. I had to tell Sveta this morning: "No, I didn't take a shit but I got my period." And that moron, instead of realizing that this is the most humiliating moment in my life, that I want to crawl into my period and die, she said in front of everyone: "Great, congratulations, good job, Tom." I never saw her smiling before. Ever. With that disgusting gold tooth and that moustache. Yuck... what a disgusting woman. I mean... don't you have someone's vomit to clean up? Don't you have any dishes to wash? I'm looking at her and she just doesn't get it. Like some autistic kid that can play the piano really well but doesn't get basic things. You were a great pianist in Russia? Go back there! And get that gold tooth fixed. Isn't it supposed to look natural? You want everyone to know daddy beat you up when he was drunk? Stupid woman. Really, pack up and go back there Rid us of your presence Leave us in peace Next time I see her I'm going to vomit on her. Okay, that's enough. Next. Change the subject. Move on. It's not just Sveta, it's all Russians I never had a problem with Russians, but now I get it: She doesn't fit in, did you see her hair? Her skin is full of pimples. There are enough problems in this country already, Just leave, get out! You don't get what's going on. She has no friends, she's in the ward all day Just leave! Give us some peace and quiet! Okay, I want us to achieve something today. The fact that you got your period back... A period is healthy. Yuck. Yuck? Yes, yuck. Periods are yuck? No, periods are excellent. I feel like a woman. So many girls here dream for something like that to happen to them. You're right. I feel blessed, it's a wonderful thing, I wouldn't trade my body with anyone. Okay, enough already. This room is where you come to get help. Don't you want to heal? Don't you miss being healthy? Nice... Change the channel! Come on, Yuval. Change the channel, We can't watch that stuff here... What do you care? Just one time. It looks interesting Are you kidding me? You know we are not watching this. We're not looking at their bodies. Oh, Come on... Hi, Do you want me to do your nails? Or you can do mine... For me, all those shapes and lines... they really help... I thought maybe... for you as well... Am I bothering you? You want me to leave...? It's just that we're all in the same boat here And if... I can help you, you can help me... You get how I feel, right? So I get how you feel, too Hello! "Je vriend here", the flying Dutchman. Wow, "achtentachtig!" You're a genius. How did you find me? You wrote on Facebook that you're in the penthouse. You're right. Are your parents here? Yosefa and Avraham? Ronen. Come inside. - Oh, Ronen. Yosefa and Ronen are... in Vienna, or Switzerland. I don't know. This apartment is usually empty. Just a second.. So how are you doing, my friend? You look good. Tell me what's going on. Are you going to "om op te treden"? To the shows? Yeah, Europe, but it's boring, the audience there is the same as here. But the money is good, I couldn't say no. Are you a large? We only have large, Americans are fat. Yes. It fits. Like those kids on their skateboards. I hate them. I bought a new tuba. You did? That's awesome. Show me. I wanted to show you something. We opened for a band at a soccer stadium in Mexico. You still watch soccer? Yes, Ajax. Ajax? They still exist? Yes, they have a new manager. This is Chrissy from Alabama. She's a hair stylist. American women are such whores. They're raised on porn, they're all shaved... I hate it. You want to teach me some songs of the band? It goes like this? Neil. Neil! What? How about you? You okay now? "Gelukkig wel." Dutch is an awful language. A combination of German and autism. "Gelukkig wel." Did I tell you the Germans are giving us a building in Berlin for a year? We're moving there. It's a retarded city but it's a fucking building. You should come, I'll be real close. It's become so disgusting. 10 years ago the cathinone here was amazing. But it's better than coke and those assholes who lived in Williamsburg for 2 years and worked in a hummus place and only stayed with Israelis and now they do coke because they're from New York. You wanna live in New York then really live there. Leave me alone. And when do I come to the shows? What shows? - The tour, to play. You mean tour with us? You can come on Monday. We can put a condenser for the tuba... You need a fire shooting tuba. You come down from the ceiling, on ropes, play a solo and pass out. I saw this Japanese band doing it, but with a trumpet and it sucked. - Yes. -Awesome. Babe, this is Neil, my friend from Amsterdam, we haven't met since 10th grade. 9th grade. -Neil like Nils? So where's Captain Akka? - You came to Rotterdam, right? -Yes Do you know who that is? Einav Friedman. She's a super celeb here. Babe, tell Neil who you modelled for. It's not funny. I'm no fucking model. You call four TV series and three months at Lee Strasberg a model? Get dressed already. It's hilarious walking down the street with her. I bump into all these Ruchmans and Pritzkers from school. "Einav Friedman...?!" Alon, are you coming or what? - Morons... I don't want go to this hospital ward thing alone. Come with us, it will be funny. -Yes. Babe, can Neil come? Yes. And a trip to London we play, the "Hope and Anchor." Talk to Steve Jackson. Hey there, gorgeous! She's one of us. Hi! -Hi. -Are the boys with you? -Yes. Okay, let them in too. We'll get them name tags. - Do it fast, it's hot. It's this procedure. Excellent. Welcome. Welcome. - Basel and also Zurich... -This is the unit. -Yes. - That I told you about. -Yes. They're so happy you're here. As you can see, this is the old wing. They do extraordinary work here... Your being here is important to them. Really. If you ask me, it's Zionism. and it's good for your image so people know you're a beautiful on the inside too. Look, the girls are so excited to see you. And we let them come outside so they can be part of it. You know, clean up the place. Tania, get up, keep working. Pssttt... Who are you? Neil. Why are you here? "Weet ik niet," Alon... Do you speak Hebrew? Yes. What is she doing? Trying to burn calories. Look at me. Have we met? Do you know me from somewhere? Rivka! - You can say Then no. - Are you sure? Rivka. Rivka! Rivka! Go Rivka! Go Rivka! Now look at my body. All of it. Do you think I'm skinny? What? - You think I'm fat? Talk, don't be scared. No... that... Chubby? - No, no, that you're... "Heel dun". What's that? that you're... ...thin. Are you lying to me? No. Then I didn't get it. Skinny or fat? Skinny. Are you asking me? Let's go. I have to, now... Tell me the truth. Am I thin or fat? Tom, help your friends. -1 can't make "problemen". No trouble, you can really help me. -1 can't make "problemen". Ok, define thin to me. Whose thin? What's thin to you? Tom! - Ok. Yeah. Neil, right? -Yes. You should help me. Think about it. We can't start eating until we're told to. Let's wait for her to sit. Hi, sweetie. Are you waiting for me? We're waiting for you too. - How sweet. Okay, be quiet! You have 30 minutes. Enjoy! - Enjoy! Hey, where are you going Enjoy. Smells good, huh? Not really, no. Looks good. It's disgusting, isn't it? What? The food. No, it looks great. Why aren't you eating? You're not eating? What? - You're not eating? Of course I'm eating, it's... really good. Remember when you signed autographs at the mall? I think so. Rinat and Hili, eat. Listen, everyone's looking at you. Did you say something? Everyone's looking, you better eat. I'm eating, it's quite delicious. Wow, you're so thin. I was there with my sister. When you signed autographs at the mall. We just passed by, for the heck of it. Oh yeah? -Yes. Was it fun? - Very. Just to see all the celebrities... I'm sorry, it's sensitive. You really have to eat. - But I can't. Einav, I'm sorry, we agreed that you'd eat. I can't, sorry. Try. Please. -1 can't. Meirav, I can't... Please sit down. Don't move! Don't panic! Please return to your seats. Welcome everyone. We are all here to honor, support, and yes, to contribute to these wonderful boys and girls, the heroes who have touched my heart. Yes. Dr. Amiram Stern, thank you for your work here at the eating disorder center. Limor, please come to the stage. Good evening. Thank you for coming. My name is Limor. This is my second time in this ward, I want to tell you about the first time. Before my army discharge. I was an officer in the combat engineering corps. At first I was happy to be away from home, eating without being judged. I loved staying weekends. My soldiers thought I'm so dedicated, I just wanted to be alone and eat. At one point I told the soldiers that I needed to inspect their packages. I began by hiding one or two and... What's going on? quickly got to a point where the soldiers didn't get any packages. I took them all to my room, locked the door and... Do you know what a soft jaw is? I don't have a gag reflex, so I can put it all in. But you're gonna tell me before you cum. Yes. -I mean it. -Yes. - It's 150 calories, Neil. The thing about candy and food in general is... there's this emptiness, and sometimes you want to feel full and... food, candies... when chocolate goes in it's... caressing. But then you have to get it out. I hoped that if I vomit the candies would come back. I tried to bring them back... Are you alright? - Yes, yes. Keep going. And... and I learned that the food that I eat must remain in my body. Sometimes I hope it will come out in my sweat and after a long time, now that I'm healed, Tom, Tom... Hold this. My leg shakes when... The Risperdal, it... it made my fingers very "steiff", I couldn't play so I stopped taking it. I also got tits. Yes... "titten" I stopped, I have to... there are many side effects so I can take the pills. against side effects... but I didn't take Risperdal... I grew "titten" too. Are you coming In Amsterdam I used to... go to the Colombian girl. 30 Euros for sucky sucky and 50 for sucky fucky. No way! What? That's tons of money. No, that's cheap, it can also cost 100 Euros. Once I saw this old man who walked up to a window, took a woman, went to someone else, another woman, like, two women. - Yes. -That could cost 500 Euros. What? Yes. - Do you think I could be good at that? If I was in Amsterdam? If it's tons of money, I don't mind being a prostitute. Do you want to be a prostitute? I want to be rich. What do I care? It disgusts me as it is. If I could make tons of money out of it... So earlier, when we... was that disgusting? Not really. I mean, a little. Sometimes it's more disgusting and other times less, but... that's life. Sometimes you do disgusting things. Eating is disgusting too. Oh, don't be offended. It's the least disgusting thing I did all day, okay? Yes. Look, the container won't be here before Wednesday, It won't help if I nag I'll get back to you... You got taller. No. I think you did. No. I got my period. You did? That's wonderful. Really? Yes, really. -That's wonderful, isn't it? That's wonderful. What? I'm just fine. This is my friend Neil. Yes, hi. Yinon, go to your room please. And take our honorable guest with you. Now, Yinon! Stop lying, you hear me? You're breaking my heart with your lies. I'm not lying. You ran away from the ward like an escaped convict. You think we're stupid? Do you think they didn't call to tell me? I really can't be there anymore. And I don't have to, I'm healthy. I got my period. That's enough. You want me to show you my pad? Look how pretty your mother is. Why she married an ugly guy like me I'll never know. -Oh, come on. Beautiful, can you give me a logical explanation why you ran away from the ward? Don't you want to be healthy? Don't you want to be a productive citizen that contributes to her country? I know what's best for me is to take some time and to take care of myself, far away from that sick ward with all those demented girls. They just pull me down. The doctors don't really care about treating us. All they do is focus on the disease and stamp it on our foreheads like a scarlet letter. That we'll be sick for life, that we'll always need care. The head of the facility looks like a man who's cheating on his wife. Yes, but you realize that if you leave the ward you're only harming yourself, right? And that it could result in you never being a mother? That it's irreversible? -I know I can do this without harming myself in the long run. I mean it. Like all those super models, when they want kids, they start eating again. Athletes too. All women whose bodies are their profession. I asked for a logical explanation, so why are you pulling my chain and telling me stories? I am being logical. Why do you think I'm not? You understand the logic of how a top spins and why you mustn't remove a bee's stinger from your arm, and about lift force, and I understand the logic of how to help myself. I'm looking for the RKO by Randy Orton. What's this? Is this water? Yes, for my arms. What? Have you ever seen "Lockup Raw" on YouTube? -No. It's these people in prison in America, they're not allowed to have regular weights so they make up exercise techniques. In prison? - Yes, in a cell the size of this room. You know what a bed press is? -No. Get up. This. It pumps up the chest and the shoulders. Triple H and Steve Austin were in prison too. How do you think they worked out? Have you ever been in prison? Yes, sort of. Really? Yes, sort of. Really? -Yes. So, you know how in isolation they're not allowed to have bags So people don't kill themselves? But they have techniques too. I haven't tried them yet. Have you been in isolation? Not isolation, I was in confinement. "Solitary". Sometimes you're tied up so you don't hit. So can I come visit you? No Want to learn some exercises? And heturns... Wow, awesome! Yinon, come to eat! Yes, we're coming. This is for later, but it's between us. If you tell my mother, i'll kill you. Yinon... Look at him. Tell me, do you ever talk? Yes, I'm Neil, nice to meet you. Do you have an accent, or is that how you talk? Serve yourselves. This is how I talk. Where are you from? Amsterdam. - Amsterdam. Neil, help yourself. I was born in Israel. In Holland, but I moved here when I was one. So, you lived in Holland for one year, before you even spoke, and you have an accent? I went to Amsterdam to study music. And moved back here. Are you Jewish? I heard about this Dutchman who kidnapped and raped his neighbour's daughters. for years in a basement. And nobody heard anything. Did you hear about that? My dad's Christian so in Holland I'm a Christian and my mom's Jewish, so in Israel I'm an Israeli. Maybe my grandfather murdered my family, I don't know. Wow, it feels so weird eating normal food for a change. I mean it. Even you say their food is a disgrace. - That's true. White bread, cheese and pudding. It's outrageous. Instead of teaching you to eat properly... -Right. They teach you to gorge yourself. You were raised well and still you disrespect your body. You're not even allowed to ask questions. It's a ghetto. A ghetto? How about we go to Yad Vashem and I'll remind you what a ghetto is. A ghetto... - You know that to this day the Germans' diet is made up mainly of white bread, sausages and butter. Isn't that shocking? At 7am they eat white bread, butter and sausage. Yes. I don't understand it. Neil, this is from the pulp of almonds. - This? -Yes. After I grind the almonds I grind the pulp and make patties. It's a bit like gefilte fish. You can eat it with the cabbage pita. You take the cabbage leaf and put in whatever you like. These are spaghetti made of raw zucchini. Everything's raw. You know what raw food is? - No. And some cucumber macaroni. -You and I will get a grip, you'll finish eating... - We'll go to the hospital, heads held high. What? I'm not going back. No reason I should. Finish eating and we'll go to the hospital. You want me to go back to a room with four psychos? I told mom, they stick cheese on their feet with cottage cheese so they can vomit it at night. While I, your daughter, feel healthy. You want to change places with me? You would never survive in my world. All the food here, Neil, is organic vegan. It's not cooked, not fried, not steamed. It's raw. The understanding that... our lives have meaning, beyond the physical human bodily pleasures that all animals feel that understanding is like an existential obsession to me. Have you heard of Nahmanides? Okay, listen, I have something to say. I apologize for the way I left the ward. It wasn't right, but something good is happening. I've been feeling fine for a very long time. I'm eating, I got my period, I feel that I've learned everything I can from that place, and I have many ideas about what to do, I have tons of ideas about what to do next, I'm not going to lay here on the couch all day I can think of a few ideas and things. I'd appreciate it if you'd help me. You're here to ask for money, huh? That's why you came here. No, I came to ask for help. No, you came to ask for money so you can keep killing yourself. I came to ask for help to start living again. Get up, we're going back to the hospital. It's over. Right now. Done! Neil, let's go. You're not going anywhere with him, -Tom, you can come with me if you want. We're going away. It's okay. She... she'll be with me, I'm going to Europe with the band on Monday and we have a house in Berlin, Its big, the house, very big. she can come with me, I'll take care of her. Berlin? She's not going anywhere whith him. You're all about ego, ego, ego! What I want, what suits me, what I feel like... It's my life, I'm not going back to the hospital. What do you think? That you were born by chance to this family, to this nation? In a specific place, and time, by accident? That all of this is accidental? And for your personal pleasures you're going to desecrate the memory of babies That were thrown into the crematoria? She's going to Berlin. Very nice. Have a good time there, on the well-kept streets of Berlin that belong to the sick German nation, the ugly, disgusting nation that seized babies from their mothers and burned them to the sound of classical music played by an orchestra of skeletons! That's enough. Those mothers are my true sisters, I am committed to them. I won't let them be forgotten. I will preserve their memory! I fought for your life in a way and at a price that you'll never understand. It's a tour, the audience in Europe is boring, but... it's a lot of money. Tell me, you flea, you, do you know what kind of Jews go there? She'll be with me. I'll take care of her. She has to be in the hospital. - Yes, it's okay. What's okay? - It's okay! Stop saying "it's okay", you moron! Don't you understand that she's in danger? You want to be responsible for her? What doesn't your Dutch brain understand? Leave her alone. Let her go. It's okay. I have to recognise that it's her, not me. She wants to go to Berlin, let her go to Berlin. She wants to kill herself, let her kill herself. It has nothing to do with me. It's her. Want to go to your place? Yes... I live in Jerusalem, in a hostel. Great. I mean... a hostel. A tourist hostel? No, it's "gek..." for crazy people. Are you crazy? Yes, I think... I'm okay, I'm not a "totaal gek" but... In Holland, I saw people... whose eyes move and they're dead and... there's movement, in the orchestra too... Do you have your own room in the hostel? I have a roommate, Stas. And Shimon. Are they cool? With me being there and all? No, it's forbidden. It's forbidden. Sorry... Okay. Yes... Yes. There's a musical piece for brass instruments... that... In the 'kerk', the 'Pian e Forte' by Gabrieli. Do you know it? Yes? It's one group against the other... So I waited for a long time, "Niet zo lang..." "ik heb lang gespeeld" but I waited and looked at the "groep" playing across from me, they were playing very beautifully. "Heel mooi". Very beautiful. And I saw their eyes moving, yes? And there was a lot of "veel beweging", a lot of movement, but they were dead. They looked like "skelleten" that... Yes, just bones, moving and... but only... like skeletons. In the asylum, to calm myself down, I used to "slaan" on the piano, it reminded me of "kikkers..." Frogs. "Kikkers." Yes. Who wants to touch my tits? People, wake up! Come on, tits! Call some more people over. -Who? - Whoever likes tits, come here now! Who wants to touch my tits? Who wants to touch my tits? Go for it. - Go for it. Come on. -You want to? - Let's do it. Want to touch my tits? - Way to go. -It's 10 shekels each. You touched my tits. Give me 10 shekels now! Come touch my tits! -I want to, hold on. Give her 10 shekels. - You touched my tits, right? Yes. - Give me 10 shekels now. Hey? What are you doing? - Give her 10 shekels! Give her 10 shekels! Give her 10 shekels! That's it. Yes. "Goed". Okay, okay, hold on, breathe in. Inhale, inhale. I'm inhaling. Yes. Are you going to take me abroad? Yes, "op maandag," yes. - What? Yes. -You're going to take me abroad? - Yes. -Then give me your phone. Yes. Hi.﻿.. guess who's out? Yes. No way! How did you know? Now, now. It's my husband's number. The audience is boring but there's lots of money. Tom! Oh my God, come on! Alon likes to ask for the best whiskey. - Come on already! Hi! -Hi! I'd like you to meet Neils. Hi. - Hey. This is Maayan. This is Daniela. What's that? It's a tuba. He's in The Misogynists. Oh, ok, really? And you wear your own band's t-shirt. Oh, yes, it was... Where's Dana? Did you tell Dana? Dana... What? - You know that Dana died. What? Really? - You're kidding me. No, I didn't know. Nobody told you? No. - Heart failure. A month ago. I didn't know that. I'm sorry, I was sure somebody told you. The day before, she went to get a tattoo with her walker and her Filipino. Dana, I hope that wherever you are you don't have a tube up your nose and I hope that awful nurse isn't chasing you and that you're not wearing a strait jacket and there's no disgusting cornflakes for breakfast and please, don't let the smell of falafel add any calories to my body and make sure I'll never have fat kids.

Imagine a magician comes to see you, and he says: "Listen, I'm giving you a 15 minute gift during which you can choose someone to come visit you." I'd tell the magician I don't want any visitors. You don't want any guests? - No. Do you want to tell us why? I like being on my own. I used to have a dog that looked like a fox. A puppy. She always made me happy. I had an angel come to me and I asked him to bestow upon me lots and lots... of money. I'd like to invite Jesus Christ. He said he'd be back soon and redeem us. No suffering, no sickness, no death, Why isn't he coming? What is he waiting for? Are you okay with serving only white food at our wedding? It doesn't dirty me as much on the inside. It's less disgusting on the sides of the stomach. Is that Okay? Only white food? And ice. We can have tons of ice. And popsicles made only of water. With the texture of a popsicle. We can put mint inside. But you don't eat the mint. And for the kids, pineapple jello, transparent... Honey I'm no lion Just a lame horse I'm sorry I'm nothing more! And longings, I can't stop Objects from collecting dust try so hard, A poisoned, defeated mouse Honey I insist on going on trusting us to try and rise above That this air with this good smell of a fresh start Will fill my miserable body like candy In an old house like yellow pictures Like confused piss Girl - Don't forget me Don't forget me Don't forget me Don't forget me Don't forget me.
