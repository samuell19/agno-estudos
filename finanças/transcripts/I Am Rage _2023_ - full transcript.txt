Just a little exporting I told you I was in the import export business Why? Well for her blood, of course You see The key to successful adrenochrome harvesting is adrenaline spikes Hormones And cortisone thrust It takes a certain skill to get it all in the bloodstream before extracting it You must keep the donor in maximum pain Normally Our clients prefer their blood a little younger But we prefer people your age Gives us more time to work Jesus Adam, are you trying to bore her to death? Why do you even bother? Rest now I'll be with with you soon I'm gonna kill you all Welcome home daughter Where's the client? We left him in the playground, so he can have some fun while he waits I wasn't talking to you And the new product? The boys are with them now is we speak?

Let's see how high we can get your adrenaline pushed up, shall we? Decisions, decisions I wouldn't do that if I were you Why is that my little sacrificial lamb? Because of my condition That's right, your medication You won't be needing these anymore Consider yourself cured You're welcome That temper isn't going to help you now Neither's that knife Hey, you okay? Get me out this fucking chair! Hold still Ah Margret Your reputation proceeds you I've heard great things about you in the circle I trust my asscocates have kept you entertained while you waited? I've had a delightful stay The entertainment has been top notch Love the masks, very old school Reminds me of a time when tradition actually meant something I'm told you want to buy a significant amount of our product? Straight to business, I like that If your product is as good as I've been told I'm here to make a deal The blood in this country is pure Untainted But it comes at a premium price Money is of no concern for my partners and I Good Ah the forbidden fruit The elixir of life, the fountain of youth To a very, very long life I'll take it How much would you like?

Perfect You guys sure know how to throw one heck of a show We aim to please Mr. Wilson Feel free to indulge in our cattle Billy will be out to round up what you leave before the main event Well, I guess a little extra target practice won't hurt Let's go boys We need to talk Michael? Peter Adam? Adam? Adam? Get up What happened? Erin she happened What? That bitch ain't human She went through us like we weren't even there Don't talk crazy, she's just a girl Here, drink He's dead You really fucked up this time Margret, Margret, please Idiot! I should have known you would have jeopardized this deal Everything is under control Peter is taking care of it Try again What would you have me do? Stay out of the fucking way Margret Michael's dead What? How? No? It was the two girls and now they're free I need to know everything about them do you understand me? Everything! Stay here I'll be right back You okay? Yeah Yeah You're not gonna find anything Where's your first aid kit? I'd rather watch the bitch bleed to death Want to try that again? Fuck you! More? It's above the sink, it's above the sink, it's above the sink Was that so hard? You have no idea who you're fucking with do you? You're already dead You just don't know it I'm sure that's what your friend Michael thought Before I dropped a locker on his head Hold this You haven't met Margret yet have you? Sister? No But I'm sure she's just as delightful as the rest of the family She runs this whole operation The whole family You think they're crazy? Billy come in, Billy? Goddamnit Billy pick up we got a situation here Billy? Billy? If you give them any hint or suspicion that we're here I'll slit your throat before you can finish your thought Billy? Billy come in Look at my eyes Do I look like I'm bluffing? Billy here Look that girl killed Michael, we have strays on the loose Copy that I need you at the playground to round up any survivors Mr. Wilson doesn't kill On my way Good Where's the nearest phone, house, sane person? There's nothing for a hundred miles And even if you find someone, we probably own them You're in their nightmares now They don't know what a nightmare is But they will If I ever see you again Billy, I'll kill you Understand? Let's go Wait here Pathetic You really screwed the pooch on this one Adam We got a bonafide celebrity in our midst Who is she? Her name, her real name Is Erin Bradley Abducted at the age of four and subjected the most heinous acts of torture and depravity For fifteen years Look she must have changed her last name, none of this flagged up by swear Go on The thing is and what's really bothering me Is not the torture or the abuse It's the circumstances surrounding her escape which raise some serious red flags What is that? That That Is what's left of her last abductors Erin did that? We need to be very careful with Miss Bradley To say that she has Anger issues would be a Gross understatement Wouldn't you agree? Her numbers are off the chart I don't know how she's alive The adrenaline traces in her blood are remarkable I've never seen anything like this before How's that even possible? No one can tolerate levels that high She's an anomaly She's dangerous No She's priceless I wouldn't do that That much adrenaline in your system could kill you Her blood will definitely have to be diluted I don't know how her heart hasn't exploded I want her to suffer Are you okay? Where are we? What did they do to you? I don't know I think they took my blood What's gonna happen to us? They're gonna kill us, aren't they? No We'll get out of this, I promise I've survived worse I knew it was you Margret What's on your mind? A new business opportunity has presented itself Mr. Wilson A one of a kind, a blood unlike anything we've come across before You have my attention But the price of this one-of-a-kind product just went up It's that good? It's better than good It's the best you'll ever have You have my word I like the sound of that, we have a deal Good, then we can begin Tradition is the cornerstone of our business Mr. Wilson We've been doing this for hundreds of years But today will be special Today we'll be hunting the prize white stag herself Go on I do have one condition though I want her to suffer I want her to feel pain until her very last breath and when butchered body is lying in the cold, rotting ground I want to toast your success With a cup of her warm fresh blood It'll be magnificent Can you do that for me, Mr. Wilson? Yes Excellent Meet your prize Mr. Wilson But be warned They're not like other girls Some of them will be a challenge even for the best of us What's with the other one? She looks a little damaged A gift for me to you A bonus kill if you'd like, but She's not the only one We put out several other donors to make the hunt more lucrative Let's make this even more interesting, shall we? If you kill the girls Your fee is forgiven But... We kill the girls first You hand over a blank check Either way you drink their blood tonight You don't disappoint I accept The torture you suffered as a child is nothing compared to what I have planned for you Yes Miss Bradley, I know exactly who you are Not yet But you will Run! Goddamnit I love this place I want her head on a plate before dark, no fucks ups this time Let the hunt begin Sarah? Over here Don't move, I'm coming for you Our first spoils of the day Don't worry, I'll get the second one We stay on target Bullseye Too slow Better than hunting deer Got you Kill the other one Leave that bitch for me Let's go rabbit Fuck you rabbit Come out come out wherever you are? You can't run forever There you are Ain't nowhere else to hide Sounds like your friend's having a real bad day Where do you think you're going? You lucky bitch! I'm gonna enjoy this Hey, where do you think you're going? Seems only fair you go out the same way as Peter Any last words? Boo Adam, you look surprised to see me? I should have killed you when I had the chance I get that a lot Please, please stop No more Figuired I'd break your heart before you broke mine Are you okay? Are you? It's over Margret There's nobody left You're still breathing aren't you? You know Got to see some of your handywork Erin Very impressive We would have been best friends in another life I doubt that I'm gonna enjoy this Not as much as I am That's the spirit I feel amazing Come on Come on! Come on! What's happening to me? Feels good doesn't it? The rage The anger See you only think you know pain But I've lived with it my whole life It's who I am You don't have the heart for it Margaret Erin... Don't you move I got her! I fucking got her! Got you! Got you! How can I help you Billy? Peter? Margret? I'm at the gate, I fucking got her! Yeah, you might be here a while Anyone? Goddamnit, come in Anyone? Goddamnit! Really? You broke my fucking nose again! Fucking bitch! What was the last thing I told you Billy? That if you saw me again You'd kill me? Yeah, that's right Billy I did say that didn't I? Goddamnit Go on vacation they said It will be good for your mental health they said
