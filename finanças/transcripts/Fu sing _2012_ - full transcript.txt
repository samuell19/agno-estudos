We were called Tankas. We lived in boats called egg shells. My child! According to Tankas' folklore, when a disaster happens at sea, Hades will replace one life with another. Are you Bo from Shau Kei Wan? - Yes, Shau Kei Wan Typhoon Shelter. - Here. Be careful. I told you he looks different. Let's not go ahead with the deal. You just had a miscarriage. Who knows if you'll get pregnant again? You need someone to help you on the boat. Don't hesitate when you sell your child or you'll end up very depressed. Mum survived the ordeal at sea. But she didn't expect a replacement child of mixed parentage and a single earring. I was that child and this is our story. Hurry up, Tai. Fion will be here any minute. I said it's time. Hurry up. She's here. - Hi, Wayne. - Hi. Do you like ice-cream? - Yes. - You do? - There you go. - Thanks. How come you're not dressed yet? My shirt's a little tight. Where's your velvet jacket? Hi, dear. - Hi, Lilian. - Auntie. I brought some ice-cream. Help yourself, okay? Okay. Try this one. Where are my shoes? Could you tell Chuen I'm not going tonight? You're not going again? Have dinner with the children then. - Great, we've leftovers anyway. - Wear this. Go ahead. I'll hold the fort at home. It's about time. We should leave. We're leaving. Bye. Why did you opt out again? Well, it's great to see you again. - Hi. - Hi. - Enjoy your night. - Yes, you too. - Nice to see you again. - Yeah. Welcome, Mr Bo. We've heard so much about the first Chinese Tai-pan of the Imperial East India Company. It's a pleasure. Thank you, Mr Tsang. The pleasure's all mine. This must be Mrs Bo. My wife's indisposed. This is Miss Fion Wong. Miss Wong? Are you that Miss Wong? You guessed right. Nice to meet you. Your dad will be here too. You see, the Governor has just sworn in and is eager to meet Hong Kong's elites. So you're among friends tonight. Thank you. - Thank you. - Nice to meet you. Cheers. You finally made it. Congratulations. - Thanks. Cheers. - Cheers. Where? Hey, Redhead. Looks like a half-breed anyhow. Who am I? I know Tai's still awake. She doesn't sleep without me. But I don't want to go to bed if she's still awake. Today's supposed to be a happy occasion. If Mum was still alive, she would've told my younger siblings to prepare a feast with lots of wine. But we can't turn back the clock. The past's water under the bridge. People from the past are already in Heaven. I'm back! You must know how to choose your fish. Mixed, why do you look so different? Did you get pickled in salt water? How am I different? We look like this fish with black eyes. But you look like a parrotfish. Come to think of it, Cousin was the first to ask why I looked different. Dad, was I pickled in salt water? What? Why do I look like a parrotfish? Tenth Aunt, come here. What's the matter? What nonsense did you tell your child? Girl! Move it, come over here. I told you to mind your language. But you just had to shoot your mouth off. - Go back. - Get lost. Kill a chicken. Why? Are we celebrating? Subsequently, whenever I asked her, Mum would say it was just more food for us. If I continued probing, she'd slap my buttocks. It's hard to tell if a log is rotten inside But it's harder to find a guy like you Where art thou It's hard to find a needle in a haystack But it's harder to find a girl like you Where art thou Cousin and I were like carrots and peas. Everyone said we'd surely get married. Don't head out to sea. A storm's brewing. But we've no food left. Mixed, Mum said we'll get married soon. But I don't have any money. Do you have any fish then? There's fish all around us. That's your wealth. Mixed, my mum said your mum isn't your mum. No, your mum isn't your mum. And your dad isn't your dad either. You're crazy. Your parents are lewd. Mum, she said you aren't my mum and Dad isn't my dad. Who told you that? Cousin. Tenth Aunt, keep your mouth shut. We'll get married as soon as I come back. Don't think of escaping. If they weren't heading out to sea that day, Cousin would've been badly beaten. I wanted to see their boat disappear into the horizon. We Tankas were blessed as we could see all the beautiful sunsets. But after disappearing into the horizon, they never came back again. Chuen. Chuen. Pastor Tung said they merely went to Heaven, a place where all of us will head to sooner or later. He also said that the departed will always live in our hearts, jumping as we jump and laughing as we laugh. That means they're always with us. But if Cousin was in Heaven, where was I? A few years later, Pastor Tung baptised me. He said that after the baptism, I'd meet Cousin in Heaven in time to come and I'd be able to ask her anything I want. - This is for you. - Thank you. God's Eternal Glory What does it say? God's Eternal Glory. Do you want to learn to write? I can arrange classes for you. Who wouldn't want to head ashore? I won't allow it. He has to hold the fort here. Ever since I got to know God, I've learnt to be grateful. Whenever Dad closed the door on me, God would always open a window. What are you looking at? My elder cousin has gone ashore. She's now working in a plastic factory. I wish to support my family by gathering leftovers from foreign ships. Why don't you head ashore too? No, Mum said I'm too stupid for that and I'd only end up as a beggar. Pastor Tung told me to go to school. But you're the eldest child. Why bother when you'll be taking over your family's fishing business one day? With an education, I can earn more money and I'll buy you a pair of gold earrings. Those earrings which were meant for Cousin now belonged to Tai forever. Fire, water, mountain, sea, wind, rain, cow, sheep, dog... Why aren't you in school? I quit! Can you write your own name? Do Tankas have surnames? Don't tell me you don't. Father, Mixed has to stop coming to school. The other parents don't want him around. - Father. - Hello, good morning. Before I knew it, I had entered the rebellious stage. Chuen. Father. Pastor Tung told me to continue my studies and gave me my first pair of shoes. Those heels were even thicker than the heels of platform shoes. There isn't a dormitory here. All of you need to get a day job. Some students here are shoeshine boys, some work in confectionery factories and some do laundry. Every evening after 7.00pm, we'll gather here for classes. Okay, let's sing a song now. Will the student in front lead the song? All right, everybody. Let's sing. We're the new generation We're masters of the future We'll drive trains and navigate planes So I was part of the new generation with the ability to master the future with modern skills. This neighbourhood welfare association turned out to be the Heaven which Pastor Tung was referring to. You'll need to share the last piece. Take it. Boat people aren't used to this. I'm a Tanka too. When I tasted bread for the first time, I felt it was heavenly. Lau Chiu Lik broadened my horizons. If you could get into Imperial East India, you'd earn a salary and even have a house when you get married. I can get salary and lodging? Just look at my elder cousin. They even sponsored his further education after he completed his training. Go away... Good morning, Sir. That's the Tai-pan of Imperial East India. I felt I was at the gate of Heaven. Paradise seemed to be within reach. My heart was in my mouth. That was a life-changing moment for me. Hurry up, rascal. Excuse me... Boss, this is my son, Chuen. I hope he can get a vessel operator licence in a few years' time. Yes, Mixed has grown up. It's time for him to get a wife, settle down and have his own boat. I'll lend him the money. Thank you... My name's Bo Wah Chuen. Mixed, so you don't like to be called Mixed? I've a proper name. Rascal, how dare you talk back to the boss! Rascal... How dare you offend the boss! You're asking for it. Why did you beat him up so badly? I'm not cooking. Go hungry for all I care. Shut up or I'll beat you to a pulp too. All that education has made him go bonkers. He actually yelled at the boss. Now, we've to return the loan and the boat. Our family's doomed. Everybody, listen up! We're fishermen. My father was one. My children will be too. Period. Cook your own meals! I was part of the new generation with the ability to master the future with modern skills. But at that moment, I was still under my dad's thumb. Nonetheless, time flies. Thank you... This is great. Is there any more food? No more! Uncle... I got lucky today. Half of the leftovers are steaks. Guess how much restaurateurs paid for them? - HK$10. - No, they just paid HK$4.50. I kept one for you. I want to see you eat it. Get out... Tai started gathering leftovers for a living while I finally left the boat for good to work and study ashore. But Dad felt I was a traitor. He told Pastor Tung he hated two people most. One was Judas and the other was me. Then one day, he visited me out of the blue. I was really scared that he'd thrash me in public. Dad, you're back. Hey. Drink with me. I'm busy. Come over. Come over. I'll wait for you outside. - You can have it. - Hey. Drink more. Chuen. Whatever you do, always take care of your family. I'm leaving. Don't forget tomorrow morning's photo shoot. So he actually came to tell me that I had grown up and it was time for me to forge my own path. Look at the camera. - Get ready. One, - The Tankas - two. - would always have family portraits no matter how poor we were. But ever since I started earning a salary, I've never treated my dad to a meal or bought him any cigarettes. I didn't even buy him clothes. - Hello? - Chuen, I'm Pastor Tung. Father? Your mum steered the boat back alone. Let me talk to her. Your mum's pregnant. I was afraid she might have a miscarriage. So I sent her to the hospital. What about my dad? The storm struck the mast and swept him out to sea. We'd never have family portraits or the chance to speak to each other again. I should've cherished him when he was alive. Soon after his death, my seventh sister was born. We welcomed a new life into our family. And I took over Dad as the head of the family. Chuen, you've to set a good example for your siblings. I will. How did you manage to pay the bills? I did odd jobs like separating grains, doing laundry and cooking. The work was bearable. No, it must've been tough. I juggled several jobs a day, from laborious work to laundry and baby-sitting. Every cent mattered. I kept my nose to the grindstone and did any job I could to support the family. After all, beggars can't be choosers. Mum. We meet again, Mixed. Mrs Bo, are you here to return my boat? We've no money and vessel operator licence. Returning the boat isn't enough. You've to pay me the money you owe me too. Please go easy on us, Boss. My children are still young. Can you reduce the amount payable? You call that young? We've already returned the boat. Why must we bear the burden of the loan which my dad took? Mrs Bo, this child of mixed parentage sure brought you luck. After he came into your family, your husband bought a boat and you had five children consecutively. This should be your sixth child, right? But this child isn't as lucky as he was. Sometimes, it's still better to buy a child. I didn't say I wouldn't pay up. - Boss, you've a visitor. - I'm coming. You aren't my biological child. But it doesn't make a difference to me. I know. I breastfed you like you were my own child. You're no different from my flesh and blood - and all your other siblings. - I know. I'm your mum. I know! Fine. I can reduce the loan amount payable. Watch out. This is Red Dragon. I'm going to defeat you. First Lass, spruce up your younger siblings. We aren't beggars. I'll counter your Red Dragon strike. Show me what you've got then. Are you going to shoot yourself in the foot? Uncle. Beat it. Uncle, lend me HK$50. The children need food. You wouldn't know how to manage such a huge sum of money. - Bamboo. - What? He'll only need one more to win now. You're only playing into his hands. Exactly. You're helping him win. - You can consider your options. - Well... Chuen. Wake up. It's dawn. Wake the others up. It's time we leave. Wake up, Kam Loy. The older girls and Lad are the luckiest. God will bless them with education, food and lodging. What about you, Mum? Let them enter the building on their own. First Lass, take the lead. Second Lass, follow your sister. Lad. Stop crying or I'll hit your first sister. No. Stop crying or I'll hit your second sis too. Come on, go in. Go and join Jesus. Don't cry. Don't cry. We aren't beggars. Stop crying. Don't hesitate when you sell your child or you'll end up very depressed. Hello, Baby. The baby's adorable. - Here's some money. - I don't want it. - No, please take it... - I don't want it. Sometimes, life's like a nightmare. But at least a nightmare isn't real. Father advised me to pray more and I got to know many saints like St. Mary, St. Joseph and St. Paul. They're all English names. When I took the exam for a place in Heaven, Imperial East India Entrance Examination I had my own English name too. Hey, Redhead. You speak English? English? What's your name? No? Looks like a half-breed anyhow. He'd like to know if you want to work here. That's it? Half-breed? Put his name down as Half-breed, will you? Yes, sir. Don't let him know you're literate. Get two forms and you'll have two options. What do you mean? If you're illiterate, a technician's the best position they can offer you. But it's a stable job despite the hard work and low status. On the other hand, if you're literate, they'll make you an office boy. What's wrong with that? You'll have to learn English. It's very difficult. If you make the cut, you can get promoted. But if you don't, you'll end up slaving away until you're old. Give me two forms. I'm illiterate. I suppose you can fill in your name. I'll fill in the rest for you. - How about you? - I want the other form. - I'm literate. - Hey! Fill in your education level clearly. That's most important. Can I simply state that I'm literate? Of course not. Sir, he has no education, but he knows how to read and write. He wants to go for office boy. Subsequently, I topped my cohort and joined Imperial East India as an errand boy. M, O. Not only did they give me a job, they even sponsored my education. I enrolled for Primary One at 21 years old and I felt like I was in Heaven. D. By walking to school, I managed to save a substantial sum of money every year. I was very contented as I had a salary and savings too. This is China. This is China. We're Chinese. We're Chinese. China is our motherland. China is our motherland. Sir, why aren't you preparing us for exams? This is more important. Don't worry about the exams. All the exam questions from the previous years are listed here. This is the flag of the People's Republic of China. During night classes by the trade union, I saw the Chinese flag for the first time. I never knew a flag could symbolise dignity. I wanted such dignity too. I completed primary school in two years. Now, they want me to be an apprentice here. So what's the point of studying? You still ended up as an apprentice. Cut it out. What's so funny? Never forget who pulled you out from the gutter, Half-breed. My name's Bo Wah Chuen. Sounds like a parrot. I collected a lot of lamb chops today. I've never had mutton in my life. Have you? No. But it should go well with fish. How do you know? The Chinese characters for "lamb" and "fish" form the word "fresh". How do you write the word "fish"? Let me show you. This is the fish's head. This is the fish's trunk. There's a cross to represent fish scales and four strokes below to represent the sea. There you go. This is a fish swimming out to sea. How about the word "sea"? It's made up of three characters. There's a man walking. There's a pregnant mother with a child in her arms. And these three strokes on the left represent the waves. So the three characters for man, water and mother form the word "sea". The sea's the mother of life. Without the sea, life wouldn't exist. Let me try writing. I've never written before. Hold the pencil tight. Fish I'm going to get a vessel operator licence. But you need to be literate to do that. It's going to be a tall order for you. This is the only way for me to take a loan, buy a boat and bring my children back. We must be together even in death. Fish Rain Direction pointer. Direction pointer. - East. South. - South. - West. - West. - North. - North. Chuen... What's this word? Love. So this is how you write the word "love"? There's no point learning that word. Nobody says it. So your husband never said that to you? Never. Did your dad tell your mum he loved her? This word's for thick-skinned people. Hill After the US withdrew from South Vietnam, the North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong launched a series of counter-attacks in the south of Central Highlands. - Violence. - Violence. - Injustice. - Injustice. - War. - War. Hong Kong Vessel Operator Grade Two Exam Paper One: Multiple Choice Candidate's Name: Bo Kum... Pastor Tung said the obstacles we face are meant to make us stronger. Hello, Father. We're moving to Vietnam. Over there, there're more orphans every day. If only I had more funds. - Goodbye, Mr Wood. - Goodbye. Goodbye, Mr Wood. Goodbye, my child. God bless you. God bless you. - Goodbye, Mr Wood. - God bless you. Goodbye, God bless. Thank you. Sir. Excuse me, Sir. I want to apply for company accommodation. I don't seem to recall your name. Can you refresh my memory? My name's Bo... Half-breed. And listen up, Half. There're two requirements. One, you got to be a full-time employee. Two, you got to be married. Do you qualify? Too bad. Sir. Can you make an exception? In your dreams. Let us now pray. May the Lord of peace Himself give you peace at all times in every way. - Amen. - All right. You don't have a vessel operator licence. If I lend you my boat, you've to pay rental. And I want half of your catch. You'll be responsible for the maintenance and other miscellaneous expenses. You need to pay for the fuel too. What fuel? Isn't it a sailboat? Everyone has motors on their boats now. I intend to install one too. You'll pay for it. But we don't have the money. Well, Mixed can bring home the bacon now. Anyway, it's your call. Chuen, don't worry. It's sink or swim for us. Let's set sail! Look at you. You look just like a Tai-pan. At least I don't have to clear spittoons. Congratulations, by the way. Why are you congratulating me? I heard you got promoted to be the head of the plumbing department. But they axed the department. Why? That Westerner Dick is a racist. We're just some bloody Chinese to him. But you upgraded the slotted angle bar. They said it was their idea. At the end of the day, I'm just a worker. I've no idea why I'm always upstaged by those Westerners. Here you go. Do you have any other requests, Mr Bo? Come in. Mr Copper. Pardon me. I thought Mr Copper was in. Copper is on leave. How can I help you? I owe everything I've got to this company. But it's not without its flaws. And I feel it's my duty to draw your attention to them. You're dissatisfied with the company? I only meant to say... You're going above your superior's head. That's dangerous. I'm sorry. Wait a minute. Tell me about yourself. Do I have something on my face? No. I'm a product of the Imperial East India Company. You're a loyal man, I like that. I first came here ten years ago. Never stayed for long, but this time... is for good. And you? Back then, I had already enrolled in the University of London and I was a registered British engineer. But I felt it'd always pay to be humble. I was practically raised by this company. Are you all right? And you? Are you all right? Darn! I haven't got a Hong Kong licence yet. Hey, watch where you're driving! He's a Westerner. This one too. No, I'm not. He's Chinese. Chinese? Do you speak English? Yes. Ask him if he wants to sue the lorry driver. They want to know if you'd like to press charges against the driver. Is anyone hurt? Do I need to get to the station? Do you want to press charges? Surely it's the other way round? He said no. Take a rest here. We'll get an ambulance. Just stay here. Move along. But he hit my lorry. Pack up and move along. But he damaged all my goods. What am I going to do? Would you rather go to the police station? Pack up... Call for an ambulance. What's going on? I'm sorry. Your wife's cake... Father... - Father. - What's the matter? Tai hasn't been baptised yet. Could you please baptise her? We're getting married. We are? She doesn't know? I've told her about it. I did, didn't I? Tai, did you miss what he said or did he forget to tell you? Chuen, you must let her know. We'll get married anyway. So we might as well do it now. Why? I'm working for Imperial East India now. I need to be married to apply for lodging. But it shouldn't be done this way. Your mum has to talk to my mum. And my mum has to seek my dad's permission. After that, we'll need to go through the elaborate customary rituals as I told you. It's hard to tell if a log is rotten inside But it's harder to find a guy like you Where art thou Why are you singing a Tanka folk song now? It's hard to find a needle in a haystack But it's harder to find a girl like you Where art thou Tai... Tai! Down with British Imperialism... In 1967, the most serious Anti-British riots broke out in colonial Hong Kong. Even Imperial East India wasn't spared. Down with British Imperialism... Down with British Imperialism... Hundreds of supporters from various leftist organisations demonstrated outside the Governor's house, chanting communist slogans and wielding banners. Down with British Imperialism... Down with British Imperialism... Down with British Imperialism... Down with British Imperialism! But it was business as usual at the company. It's a big arrangement. It's a lot bigger than we expected. Can I say a few words, please? Thank you. Run along, man. Hong Kong Vessel Operator Grade Two Exam Candidate's Name: Bo Kum... Mummy, Brother wet his pants again. What? Wayne, don't swap lunch boxes with your classmates again. Your teacher said you exchanged a drumstick for candied plum. - Hurry up or we'll be late. - That was dumb. - No wonder you're so skinny. - Time to go. You should've woken up earlier. - Say goodbye to Daddy. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of the UK arrived in Beijing this morning for a meeting with Deng Xiaoping at the Great Hall of the People. The two leaders expressed their views on Hong Kong's future and engaged in an in-depth discussion. After the meeting ended, Mrs Thatcher fell on the stairs as she was leaving. UK and Chinese officials helped her up. I don't like it. Fion, please. Congratulations. Yeah. You've really had it made, haven't you? I mean, I don't know. A fat pay cheque and well-paid vacations for doing absolutely nothing? Hey, I want your job too. Yeah, really. That's why they call you Dick. - Dick! - Fiona, please. Be reasonable. You want me to be reasonable? I could've sued you for this disaster. You know that, right? Don't you? How can you stand this crap? Enough! This is a reputable British company. Well. I'll see you in court then. Oh, thank you for your wine. Fion, please. Dick, please leave now. Fion, please. Bo, could you come up here? I've decided to replace Mr Callahan with this gentleman. Bo. Please. How long did Mr Callahan say it'd take to finish the building? 150 days. It started for ten days and it's four days late, all right? Give me 120 days. What makes you think you can do it? The scaffolding will be constructed in Japan. We'll put it together here like Lego. What's your name again? Bo. His name's Mr Bo Wah Chuen. You know, I got a Master's degree in architecture when I was in L.A. After that, my father asked me to come here to help. What about you? I'm nothing compared to you. You soar in the sky while I crawl on land. You mean swim like a fish? Yes. I swim like a fish. I'm a parrotfish. What? Hey, Greg. - Hi, Boss. - Hi, Sally. - Hello, Fion. - Good afternoon. Don't worry, we're in good hands. We won't delay you anymore. - See you then. Bye. - Bye. Sorry to interrupt, Bo. My wife and I would love to have you at our Christmas party next week. Fion got lost last year. We nearly had to get a helicopter to find her. Please. And bring your wife. And enjoy your lunch. It's on me. - Thank you. - Thank you. Congratulations. Why are you congratulating me? Only the elite gets invited. No wonder I've never seen you around. Welcome. But I'm not used to socialising. No need to worry, I can train you. You mean like in My Fair Lady? Yeah. But let's start with that. I accidentally dirtied it during work. You know, today's Sunday. Only the waiters wear ties. Thank you. This woman has seen the world. And at that moment, she saw something in me which I had never noticed before. Who am I? I'm a parrotfish. I'm someone of mixed parentage. I'm Half-breed. I'm Bo Wah Chuen. What else? Is she a gift from Heaven? Can I pass? Come on, let's go. It's a much sought-after opportunity. If you're hungry, heat up the food - in the kitchen. - Mummy, your hearing aid. Your hands are dirty. Wash his hands before he eats. - Let's go. Sleep early. - Okay. Don't watch TV. Lock the door. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. When we arrive at the McCordles' residence, his wife will come out to welcome you. Hi, dear. Remember we met her at the Jockey Club cafe? See you then. Bye. She didn't greet you back then as she felt you were just a small potato. When we arrive at her house, she'll lead Tai to the ladies' group and introduce Tai to the other ladies. Why don't you come with me, Tai? They all look like they're born with silver spoons. Even if they can speak Mandarin, they'll still converse with you in English. And McCordle will introduce you to the rest. They'll discuss topics alien to you as part of your initiation ritual. Our company's new up-and-rising star, Bo. - Say hi. - Hello. - Hello. - Nice to meet you. I've heard so much about your husband. Oh, my Greg doesn't talk about anyone else these days. But I've read an article about your husband the other day in the Morning Post. So dapper! You must tell me your secret about his upkeep. Mine is falling to pieces. Get him to work on a tugboat. Later, girls. Stay... Have some tea. How's your holiday? - Hey, that's nice. - Yeah. Thanks. Try some. It's really nice. Yeah. - Cheers. - Congratulations. Cheers. So what are you people going to give him? For Bo. This may well be the last funfair before the end. Pardon me? Haven't you heard? From now until '97, there will be no more projects from the government and all government contracts will only be valid until 30th June 1997. No. Our mother company wants to know whether we should leave Hong Kong. They want our views, especially the views of a local businessman with a thorough knowledge of China and Hong Kong and of Western business practices. Dare say you fare better than I did. They go to the same public school. Meritocracy, my arse. - Oh, Dick, for heaven's sake. - Hey, you. - How's it going? - We weren't expecting you, - Dick. - Oh, I forgot I wasn't invited this year. Just come say farewell to the boys. Merry Christmas! - I'll bring you out. - Let go of me! Jingle bells, jingle bells jingle all the way Let go of me, Half-breed! Thank you for giving me an English name. Without me, you would've rotted in the sea and got shat out by sharks. But the rest, I achieved by myself. You think you're one of them? Did you go to the same school as them? Do you speak with the same accent? This company, this land, will never belong to you. It'll always be theirs. Mr Bo. Bo Wah Chuen, a role model for youths Boss. No... Just call me Chung. I'm sorry for what I did to you in the past. I had to consider my business interest. But I'm out of business now. The government has stepped in to offer loans for fishing boats at lower interest rates. They've even acquired the fish markets. Mr Bo, if there's anything I can do for you, please feel free to call me. Thank you... I shan't delay you any further, Mr Bo. Congratulations too. Goodbye. You've to queue up with the alien passengers. I'm British. I'm afraid not. This is a British passport, isn't it? You're a subject of a British colony, so by definition, you're British. Reality is, you've no nationality. Then what am I? I'm afraid I don't have the answer for that. Sorry, that's history for you. I've put you down for a membership at the Jockey Club. Bo. Bo. Are you okay? Sorry, jet-lagged. But I don't gamble. It's just another way for you to make more contacts. Do you know how long it normally takes to get one of these? Five years is what I heard. Now, it's just a signature away. I've a question. Fire away. How high could I ever get to in this company's hierarchy? My assistant? We can arrange for you to get British citizenship. What are you thinking about? Joining the high society, getting British citizenship and speaking English feels like joining a secret society. Do you like it? Do I like it? I guess I do. Can I ask you something? Sure. Do you find me annoying? What made you say that? My parents... Their relationship's on the rocks. Since I was a kid, I've been afraid of getting abandoned if they file for divorce. My fear of being disliked became a phobia. Hug me. Hug me like this. You never told me how you feel. Tankas aren't good at expressing emotions. But you aren't a Tanka anymore. Don't forget to tell your wife how you feel or she'll never know. And don't forget that I told you that. Fion? Bo, are you coming? This is where it all started. We transformed this place from a fishing village to what it is today. Do you mean the British or the Imperial East? The Imperial East, of course. They first came here on our ships. I was the errand boy 100 years ago. Let's leave. McCordle groomed me. I'll always be grateful to him. 14 years later, he returned to the UK on the eve of Hong Kong's handover. He was worried about the repercussions for calling the police during the riots. His fate was linked with Lau Chiu Lik's. But the company continued to prosper and its last colonial Tai-pan subsequently died in a London nursing home. This is where it all started. Your birth mother was very young back then. She didn't even know she was pregnant. Who's my real father? When she was gathering leftovers, she got conned by a British naval officer who raped her on board a ship. This is where Mum bought me with HK$500. Queen of Heaven, have you seen my birth mother since then? Does she miss me? Has she been doing well? I've fought the good fight. I've finished the race. I've kept the faith. You've already provided for your siblings. Now, they have their own families and houses on land. It's my duty as the eldest child. I like it here. I don't want to relocate. Are you sure it's good here? Leave the boat after you perform the marriage ritual for Little Sis. You're a good child. You're a gift from God. He gave me all the gifts which your birth mum should've been blessed with. She had a bad lot in life, but I was blessed. So I ought to count my blessings. I shouldn't be greedy. What are you saying, Mum? This earring belonged to your birth mum. I found it on you. You found this earring on me? But nobody ever saw her again. Mum, come and live with me. She's here... No, this isn't correct. Sit the other way. You've to face the moon. Let's perform the hair-combing ritual. May your marriage last a lifetime. May your marriage last a lifetime. May you be blessed with longevity. May you be blessed with longevity. May you be blessed with many descendants. By the Grace of God, Mum was blessed with 11 grandchildren. During public holidays, we always had family reunions where we enjoyed one another's company. She spent her happiest moments with them. Even when she became immobile later in life, her daughters, sons-in-law and even grandchildren would drive her to the places she wanted to go, whether she wished to visit relatives or attend church gatherings. Okay, get ready. Like every mother who graced the Earth, she toiled tirelessly for her children throughout her life. Praise the Lord for giving us such a mother. It has been a great blessing to be her children. Let's now view a video clip to honour the life of Mrs Bo. After Mrs Bo retired, she continued to be active in church, studying the Bible and practising writing every day. She made it a point to remember every single word in the Bible and hymns. And when she came across new words from the television or elsewhere, she'd always seek to clarify the meaning. This was how she expanded her vocabulary. Dad. Why aren't you sleeping at this late hour? Mum has been complaining of dizziness. She said it's an unsteady feeling, as if she has just disembarked from a boat. Has she seen a doctor? The doctor found nothing wrong. There's always been a problem with her ear. Pay more attention to her, all right? She hasn't changed the batteries in her hearing aid for a long time. Let me take a look. I only realised yesterday that it has long broken down. Mum even said that she's useless and that Auntie Fion could help you more. Go to bed. Let's ask this foreigner. Go ahead. Excuse me, taxi to The Peak? Take the tram, you'll get a better view. He speaks good Mandarin. Your Chinese is good. Where's the taxi to The Peak, please? You'd better take the tram. You'll get a better view. Do you mean the taxis are over there? Yes. Behind? Behind. I told you it's that way. Let's go. Okay. Thank you very much. - Goodbye. - Thank you. - Daddy. - Daddy. Where's your mum? She's in the kitchen. It's hard to find a needle in a haystack. But it's harder to find a girl like you. Where art thou? I was the one who made Tai plunge into a living hell. Whatever I might be, that wasn't what I wanted for my loved ones. Before Mum retired, she retook the exam and finally got her vessel operator licence. Her boat has now set sail towards the ocean and the most beautiful sunrise on Earth.
