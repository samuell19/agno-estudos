This is John Sperling live from the Angel Stadium in Atlantic City, New Jersey. It's the Saturday Night Seven Seas Spectacular, laser beamed throughout the world by Seven Seas' own multi-channel satellite. Tonight, Seven Seas lntertelevision is proud to present your own super champion Drake as he challenges five of the world's top kill bikers. Maliapa, seven times champion of the Yellow Sea. Utza, undefeated champion of Afghanistan. Alid of Arabia, also known as the Fighting Shiek. Morris, the Tiger of Asia, and champion of Burma. And last but not least, Harim, champion of the Glacier Confederation. You may remember live audiences were banned 10 years ago after 2000 fans were killed in crowd violence. And it's time for the traditional ride-past ceremony that precedes every Kill Bike contest. Look at the control these champions have over the machines. Those spectacular slanted jumps are designed to sharpen the riders' skill and timing for the contest about to begin. And there's the start. Now Alid and Maliapa have Drake in a sandwich. The champ looks like he might be in trouble. But no, a left kick to the chest, and then Alid bites the dust. And now Drake's going after Maliapa. Drake's fist catches her with a devastating blow! There's dialogue between Drake and Morris. But Utza has zeroed in on the champ, and here he comes. But it's Drake who makes the move, and now there's only one left. Harim, the Tiger of Asia. It's that left foot again. And there goes the Tiger. Not even a "better luck next time" for him. Once again Drake is Seven Seas' undisputed Kill Bike champion. And now a surprise announcement. One week from today, live on Seven Seas Channel 5, Drake will marry Hollywood's own Susan Harper. The beautiful star- - Kill it. And we have WBS kick in a half-dozen more sponsors as a wedding present. An empty stadium and six lousy bikers wasn't cheap enough for them. Sarah, next week they'll wipe us out with their pretty boy and his Tinsel Town mermaid. I guess we could say Seven Seas has scored the ultimate in computer game dating. Sybil, what's the latest reading of the approval display? How's the Danger Game looking? Unfortunately, the last approval rating didn't hit 40, but never mind, Cortez. Sarah has a winner cooked up for this week. For her sake, I hope so. It's The Danger Game on WBS. Watch lovely Linda Summers from Big Fork, South Dakota match her self-control against the horror of certain death! The more she screams, the faster the pendulum will fall. Can Linda beat The Danger Game deadline by surviving for more than two minutes? If so, she'll win a free week for two in romantic Hawaii! What a shame, Linda. What a shame. You almost made it. What went wrong? It looked so real, I just panicked. Silly, I know. I really wanted to win that trip. Well, maybe next time. Yes that's The Danger Game, ladies and gentlemen, the one and only show that takes you right up to death's door to see if you've got what it takes to go through it. Well? What's it read? 32. That's the winner you cooked up? A new low. But look what we're up against. Drake. No way, we can't fight that. I know. Worse than a soap opera. Cut it. Corn like that went out with the automobile. And they get 87%. It's unbelievable. And I invented him by putting him on his first motorcycle. He gives them what people want. Violence. They know Danger Game isn't real. That's a pretty grim view of humanity. Hello, this is your friend Sam speaking. Yes, grim but true. Violence pays, and it's going to pay big for our WBS. Death for the loser, glory for the winner. To make up for your recent failures, we are going to bring back ancient formula violence in its most successful form, gladiators in ancient Rome. A fight to the finish with guts, blood, and death, and all for the glory of our big happy family. With only one show, we will wipe all competition off the charts. You have 40 days to put these gladiator games together, and I know I can count on you and your team, Cortez. Yes, Sam. Hello, this is your friend, Sam. Now that you've just touched down on the landing plinth of the new colosseum, Cortez will consult Junior for logistic input concerning the final phase of the games in Rome. Yes, Sam. Cortez to Junior. Please enter personal code. Access granted. Sam has negotiated purchase of 20 condemned criminals held in death rows of many different countries. These men have volunteered to compete as gladiators in return for free pardon in the event of victory. Market research has determined a popular hero essential to give gladiator contest a positive element. Optimal choice, Drake. Drake. Who are these men? Ancillary support units. Communication terminated. Intruders on the property. Intruders on the property. Intruders in the house. Intruders in the house. Intruders on the property. Intruders on the property. Intruders in the house. No! No! Oh, please! Oh! What do you want? No! Please! Please! No, don't hurt me! What do you want? Don't touch me! No! Susan! This is Hank Martinez live from Rome, Italy, with another flash for WBS viewers all over the world as the countdown continues to next Saturday's sensational action extravaganza. And it is my privilege to announce that the star contender on that great occasion will be none other than Drake, the world's most popular Kill Bike champion, now condemned to die for killing the three men who brutally murdered his lovely young wife. As an alternative to the death sentence, we have been able to include him in what will go down in history as the greatest extravaganza of mortal combat ever staged, the Battle of the Damned, an authentic reconstruction with a few updated details of the great gladiatorial combats of ancient Rome. Thrill as the Caesars did at the sight of condemned warriors fighting for their lives. Thank you, Hank Martinez in Rome. So far we're right on the money. What about the Praetorians? Mobile cam two, three, four, and five. This is Hank Martinez live from the new Coliseum in Rome, Italy, where in a few seconds, the man who is still the world's most popular sport hero will step out of the transport module to meet his appointment with destiny in the Eternal City. And there he is, Drake, on his way to the gladiator barracks to train for next Saturday's Battle of the Damned. Don't miss it on WBS... Live on all five continents in Globalvision. What is this for? It's nothing, Drake. Just keeps track of how you are and where you are. We wouldn't want to lose our champion. Besides, all our contestants wear one. Cortez, what have you got to do with these games? You'll see. This red light here is you, and the others are your competition. And of course, we realize no one would be fool enough to try to escape, but it comforts us to know exactly where you all are, day and night. It comforts me to know that you haven't changed in seven years, Cortez. You're still a snake. Things do change. Heroes turn into convicted killers. And remember, I taught you everything you know. Raven. Take him away. And explain who the boss is around here, but don't overdo it. Champions can be fragile. Cortez. Go to hell. I would if I thought it would raise my ratings. I'm Raven, your trainer. My job is to teach you to hate to help your motivation. I think it's going to be a great pleasure. Let's go, champ. The boys are dying to meet you. Hold it. So? Be my guest. Hey. What do bikers eat most? My dust. Monk, what are you doing here? I got them to sign me on as your grease monkey. I eeded the work. I haven't had a ride since I hit that wall in Detroit. How are the eyes? Just great. Those fibers they stuck in my eyes see better than the real thing. When did they bring you here? Couple of days ago, right after the news broke you were in the games. I was really sorry to hear what they did you, kid. I still can't believe - Forget it, Monk. It's good to see a friendly face. I don't know why they're doing me any favors, though. So. What's this place like, anyway? You'll find out. Worst bunch I ever saw. Kill for kicks, and a celebrity is just what they want to get their teeth into. Don't take your eyes off anybody, ever. Nice little charm bracelet, huh? Forget about taking it off, unless you want to cut your wrist in two. Well, you want to make a tour of this summer camp? I know you're gonna love it. Come on. Abdul Kareem, training challenge. Hey, champ! It slipped. Some group you got here. Not bad, Abdul. Akira, training challenge! Now let yourself go, just relax, mind and body. Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid, I'm just wondering what you and this big gadget are up to here. It's normal induction procedure. I'm establishing your auto control threshold so the computer knows how to program your training schedule. Oh yeah? Tell me about it. Laser points will penetrate your subconscious, then visualize your aggressive impulses on that screen. What's your name? Sarah. You're in the hate business, Sarah. I can't understand why you people won't let anyone show any mercy on worldwide TV. I run computers, and it doesn't matter to me if I analyze men or rock samples. You always look away like that when you're telling a lie? It's very cute. Lie about what? About not caring, Sarah. Breathe slowly and deeply, please. Good, like that. You bastards! Susan! Susan! Maximum violence level reached. You're capable of killing. You can kill now. Don't hold back. Let go. Let go. Don't hold back. What happened? It's over. Your control threshold has been established, and your training schedule is programmed. Drake! Drake. At the whistle, take your gun. If anyone gets in your way, use it. I've never used that gun! You hear me? I never used it! We know different. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! - No! Pick it up! - No. - Pick it up! Pick it up! No! No! - Pick it up! Kill them, it's an order. Kill them. Kill them! Kill them! No! You can't stop, Drake! Kill them. They murdered your wife. You can't stop, Drake, you can't! They murdered your wife! Kill them, Drake, like you did before! Kill them! Drake, kill them! Pull the trigger. Pull the trigger! Kill them! You killed them before! No. I didn't kill them. I didn't kill them! I didn't kill them. I didn't kill them! I didn't kill them! Raven, what's going on? Drake won't kill, Cortez. I've got him at maximum psychological pressure. What do I do? Forget it. Next time, don't give him any chance to think. Dematerialize the image. How is it that Drake managed to resist hate stimulation? Not authorized to respond. Was it computer error? Negative. Then was it alternative programming? Not authorized to respond. Does Cortez know about it? Not authorized to respond. Hey champ, how's it feel to come from the winner's circle to this dump? Hang on, champ. We understand they plan on having you win the battle. Just remember one thing. We're all in the same boat, you included, champ. Hey, champ! That's enough. What are we fighting for, huh? What are we fighting for? What the hell are we fighting for? Oh. They want a show, let's give 'em a show. When it's showtime, all right? Right now we're in the same boat. So why don't we just act like. Huh? Champs. The Praetorians, watch it! Send him back where he came from. We can't use wrecks on camera. Where are you sending him, Raven? Where he belongs. We're replacing him tomorrow. Penitentiaries are full of would-be TV stars. Real pretty ones, too. Wait a minute. You can't send him back there. You're the guys who messed him up. We can do any little thing we want with you rejects. You want to keep that in mind. Get to your bunk. Thanks for this, Raven. I'll see you later. You broke the rules. That was really stupid. You know what you can do with your rules, Raven? We all volunteered for these games for a chance to save our own skins, not to be pushed around by you and your goon squad. So you ought to let Kirk come back here and train with us, or we're gonna start these games right here and now. We've all got murder raps here, so a few bodies more or less isn't gonna make any difference. Get them back, back! Don't move, he's bluffing. What have we got to lose, Raven? Nothing. But if you screw up these games, you've had it. Good thinking. Without you, Drake, they have a show without a champion. I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were you. Okay, Raven. Now I want you to zap me with your magic stick. Come on. Now watch it, Raven, because if I fall through that arch, oh, I'm gone. And you can't have that, can you? That's better now, a little hesitation. Now I want you to turn off this disintegrator. Never. You do what you're told, Raven, or I'm gonna march right through this thing, you know [ will. Okay. Have it your way. Oh, by the way, meat head, you forgot about this. We're not going anywhere. I just wanted to point out something to you. We're more important to you than you are to us. Why did you bring me here again? This is the tape of your subconscious memory of the night your wife was murdered. It's against the rules, but I believe you should see it- No, Sarah, I can't stand to see that tape again. I know it won't be easy. No. But I believe it will help you. How is it going to help me? Drake, believe me, please. It's for you. Watch. Susan! Susan! Susan! Two of the men were already dead. When you entered the house, there was a fourth person in the room. He knocked you out, killed the other man, and pinned it on you. Why are you telling me this? Let's just say you don't seem like a killer to me. I wanted to see if I was right. What did you say your name was? Sarah. Why are you requesting access to Junior? Two reasons, one has to do with Drake, and the other with Junior himself. Drake's innocent, I can prove it conclusively. You can? I asked a secondary computer for an analysis of Drake's memory tape. But Junior's got a hold of anything that touches Drake. I think the computer is... Hello. The computers are programmed to broadcast the games in just under 60 hours. And you have no time for petty arguments. Mind on the job, Sarah. Yes, Sam. Computers. We built them to be our slaves, but we're turning out to be theirs. She's got a cute little nose. Too bad she sticks it in other people's business. Hmm, that could become your next assignment. What do you mean? Your job will be to put yourself between Sarah's nose and my plans. Our plans. Drake. Look at my hand. I wouldn't be surprised if it catches high frequency signals too. I'll be damned. Yeah, it's incredible what they do with microprocessors these days. They can melt any metal, knock out any transmitters, tracking stations, you name it. Here, you gotta swallow it. Check gladiator control lights. Gladiator control lights normal. - Come on. - Hold it. Mind if we tag along? What's the idea? Without you, there won't be any games, right? So if you're leaving, no sense in us sticking around. Gee, I'd hate to take you away from all this. After you, Einstein. So, you still nervous about going first? That's just my nature, champ. After you. Okay. That's an old gladiator. Yeah, looks like he lost. You lost? Hey, if I am you are too. Never underestimate Sam, he thinks of everything. Besides, all the old catacombs have security monitors we just plugged in. Great TV. Mr. Drake, it's not like you to run away from a fight and disappoint people. You're part of our big, happy family now, and very necessary. You're our star. Now an action replay of the escape attempt. You are there every step of the way as these dangerous criminal gladiators make their bid for freedom. News when it happens, while it happens... And 55 seconds, 56, 57, 58, 59, eight minutes. Getting tired, champ? Nice going, champ. Who is going to be the first to fall and fry? You, champ. Go on. Stupid, let go, go on. Whose fingers are beginning to slip? When you hit the floor, you will sizzle like fried eggs. 58, 59, nine minutes. Only three more minutes to go. Kirk! Come up. Kirk! Come here. Kirk. Kirk. Get up, Kirk. Get up! Damn it, get up, Kirk! 10 minutes, one second, two seconds, three seconds, four... Five. Six. Seven. Eight. What do you want? Professor Towman? Professor Towman, I'm so glad I found you. Towman? There's no one here by that name. I don't expect you to remember me, but I could never forget you. I took your advanced telematics course at Rockingham eight years ago. Professor, what happened? I mean, a scientist of your stature, your research? Let's just say I invented... A better brain than my own. A major mistake. Now to see if my mind still functions. Yes, you're Sarah, Sarah Newman, doctoral thesis. Accepted at age of 17. Telematics in the simulation of experience, and now you're with WBS. Why'd they track me down? Junior, I suppose. Professor, I believe Junior has programmed a murder, at least one, probably more. No my dear, absolutely impossible. Junior is an autonomous system that can do anything a human brain can do, an infinitely superior human brain, except to destroy. You see, I managed to eliminate all impulse to destroy anything. I simulated a human brain that's unique, completely benign. But do you still have access to Junior? I know the entire module has been brought here to Rome. Perhaps you could... If what you say is true, it could mean an evil force, an element beyond my power, now controls Junior. Are you trying to say Junior has a soul or a spirit? I don't know. The Junior I created knew right from wrong. He wasn't programmed to do wrong. But if someone gains control of his intellect, he could do evil. And someone has, Professor. I have to access to him before more evil is done. You must have a key of some kind, an emergency access code, something. Just a moment. WBS required me to hand over all the keys I had, except one. It was the prototype. I kept it as a souvenir. And I also have the original circuitry diagrams on microfilm. Wait here, I'll get them for you. Professor. Professor Towman! Professor Towman! My god. Professor Towman. Easy, miss, easy. Easy, it's me, Monk. Oh, Monk. What are you doing here? Drake told me to keep an eye on you. I followed you. Who else knows you're out here? Monk, it's Sybil. Someone's killed her! Yeah, about a minute ago. I saw a guy run out as I was coming in. If it hadn't been so dark, I'd... Who was it, Monk? The police? No, never saw him before. We'd better get moving. The show is about to go on the air. I got some work to do and Drake's bike. The police will take care of the bodies. Come on. Live from the New Coliseum in Rome, Italy, the Battle of the Damned, in Globalvision on WBS! Only moments to go before the players enter the field. This is a fine moment for the World Broadcasting Service, your eye on the best in global entertainment, brought to you through our exclusive laser satellite system. The most sensational shows ever conceived for video entertainment in the comfort of your own homes. And here they come, the gladiators of the 21st century. Each Kill Bike contestant is a condemned criminal who hopes to escape public execution by outriding and outwitting the other 19 contestants, and so winning this extraordinary event. Now, as the tension rises, let's meet these mega men who will risk everything for a chance to start a new life. First, Drake, world-famous sport hero and the star of our show. Kirk, the chainsaw murderer from Minnesota. Tango, from Argentina, 21 counts of homicide. Akira, the Scourge of Outer Mongolia. Access refused to all WBS personnel until further notice. Access granted. With less than one minute to go to start time, it's over to John Sperling for the blow-by-blow action commentary. Thank you, Hank, and a big- 24. 23. 22. 21. 20. 19. 18. 17. 16. 15. 14. 13. 12. 11. Good evening to all WBS personnel. As we count down the final seconds towards history's most spectacular sports extravaganza, I would like to congratulate you all on the magnificent job you have done preparing this show. The whole world is watching WBS, and we are going to keep it that way. Yes, Sam. There's 30 seconds to go before the start of the ultimate in Kill Bike events. This is it. The riders surge forward for the first big clash. There's Akira and Obronski fighting it out hand to hand. Watch that samurai sword do its job. And the first gladiator bites the dust. Thad Hagen grabs a lance and turns to face a double challenge. It's two down and 17 to go. Gladiators regroup for the next clash. Maxwell Andronica bearing down on Drake. He swings with his hammer. Drake avoids the blow and sweeps his assailant out of the saddle. Andronica down, but not out. I'll be, Andronica's out of the fight for sure. At the end of two clashes, it's four down and 15 to go. Cortez elaborates all data input to Sam. Has Cortez ordered any other changes in the official program? Affirmative. What changes? All surviving gladiators to be dematerialized 20 minutes after end of games. My god. Triggered by gladiator security bracelet. Why does he want to do that? To discredit incumbent president of WBS and take his place. Junior, can you cancel the killing of the gladiators? Negative. Then I'll reprogram. Negative. Only Sam can override priority program. Then can you put me in touch with Sam from here? Negative. Then can you contact him and tell him what's going on? Negative. That's Abdul sliding into closeup. Six counts of cold-blooded murder. An expert with every kind of blade. The deadly process of elimination continues. Now eight are down. There's that lancer again. The weakest fall to the strongest as the relentless process of natural selection runs its course. Nine down and 10 to go. Drake lunges with his left foot. Another contestant swerves out of control. Now there are only 10 gladiators left alive. Another classic spill. Like you said, John, Drake's right at home out there, a real champion. A thrill a second. There it is, our largest television audience in history. Fred. - Yes, Mr. Cortez? Where's Sybil? She hasn't come in yet, sir. Have her paged, she should be here. It's her triumph too, in a way. I'll get right on it, sir. Cortez, voice access to Junior. Access refused to all WBS personnel until further notice. I said this is Cortez. Access refused to all WBS personnel- I said... Call on out-monitor B for Cortez. I'm Cortez. Sir, we found the body of your employee, Sybil Finch. Sam. With the governments in question, and all legal and moral issues have been thoroughly ironed out. Sam. And now, it's back to the New Colosseum Arena and John Sperling for more action and thrills in the Battle of the Damned, part two. Thank you, Hank, and once again it's John Sperling from the Eternal City talking to you live on WBS Globalvision. After the individual combat event, WBS presents part two of the most spectacular video show ever seen. You thrilled to the savage intensity of hand to hand combat. Now you're in for another exceptional human contest, the fight to the finish chariot race. 20 perilous laps of no-holds-barred motorized conflict. Death is the penalty for a gladiator who leaves the track, or refuses combat. Death will ride with every man as he fights for his life. Only the best have survived to man the five chariots. Thad with Drake, Abdul with Stone, Akira with Kurt, Tango with Shorty, Ogre with Shark. Praetorians patrol the sidelines, ready to eliminate any contestant who tries to escape. Take a good look at these men. You'll never see them again alive. Only one will live to see another day. Over to you, Hank, for the countdown. 10 seconds to go, John. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Zero. They're off. And it's back to you, John. Abdul and Stone are first off the line with a vicious side-swipe into Drake's chariot. But the champ's not caught napping. He swerves away, racing down the sidelines. There goes the first victim of the second event. His partner gone, Drake is the fastest man on the track, but the other four chariots are hounding him all the way. Kill Bike champion Drake is an expert at one-sided combat. Drake's setting the pace, calling the two. Oh, a nasty way to go. Now there are only eight desperate men vying for a new tomorrow. Drake strikes again, and Shark pays the price. Look out, that chariot's out of control. Right into a perimeter obstacle. The Praetorian guard zaps the gladiator for being off the track. Tony takes one of Abdul's knives in the back. That's five down and four to go. There goes another as Akira skewers Stone in the ribs. There's something unscheduled happening in the arena. Drake and Abdul appear to be teaming up. And what's that? A lone Kill Biker has just entered the track. I've spoken with Junior. Whoever wins will be disintegrated within 20 minutes. What the hell is going on? The control module, on top of that tower. We gotta break in and reprogram Junior, now! Saddle up! In a few minutes, they're gonna disintegrate us. Stop! Where are you fools going? Stop there! Stop, that's an order! Stop or we'll fire! This is Cortez. I demand immediate voice access to Junior. Access refused to all WBS personnel until further notice. I said this is Cortez. Access refused to all WBS personnel until further notice. Kill the show! Hit the out theme! - You mean run the intro? - Anything! Get it off the air now! No. No. No! No! Ah! Hold it, nobody move! Hold it! Drake, hurry! Cortez is on his way to Junior. We have to stop him. Hurry! Cortez to Junior. Cortez to Junior! Access refused to all WBS personnel until further notice. That's it, Cortez. Hold it right there. You think I can save you, Drake? Think again. It's too late. You've been programmed into oblivion. It's Sam, not me. It's Sam. He fixed all our wagons. He programmed the games, your wife's murder, and now yours. You're lying. You're trying to save time, Cortez. So kill me. You've got six minutes left. Use one to kill me. It'll be my pleasure, Cortez. Who's gonna kill us, how? You think those charm bracelets are just for decoration? They're very ingenious devices. They keep track of you while you're needed, and zap, disintegrate you when you're not. No! Five minutes to disintegration. Five minutes to disintegration. You're not computers, but you still act according to plan, and right on schedule. You've killed the only man who could've stopped me. Cortez was ambitious and stupid. That's always dangerous. We're dangerous too, Sam, and we're coming for you. You don't have time, my human friend. You've got to find me first. We'll find you, Sam. I'll tell you what. Since you're about to die, I'm going to show you just who I am, just what you're up against. There. There. That's SAM. The first and only Space Animate Module. 250,000 miles up. Come and get me. Come and get me. My god, that's Junior's soul. Sam isn't human at all. You mean that's just another computer? More than that. Professor Towman explained it. It's a computer projection in human form, created independently by Junior. Junior's soul must have corrupted itself. Yes, I was conceived by Junior to compensate for the exclusion of evil in his circuitry. Now, thanks to you, I have the attention of the whole world. Through WBS, I will control all humanity. Cortez didn't know how right he was when he said men were slaves of computers. Three minutes, 49 seconds to disintegration. There's got to be a way to stop this. There is one way, program Sam's destruction code. I still have Towman's access key. At least we can get as far as Junior. Three minutes to disintegration. It's stuck. Two minutes, 30 seconds. Monk. Monk! No! Monk! Monk! Monk? No, Monk! Monk! Two minutes to disintegration. Look! It's a micro-camera. So Monk has been Sam's spy all along. This is how they found us in the tunnels, then. One minute, 30 seconds. We'll never make it. Unless Monk... Unless Monk what? His eyes, the micro-camera. There's a chance it's a memory bank too. It's just possible it memorized Junior's plan. Towman had them in his hand when he died. So what do we do with this, then? Sam's destruction code, it must be an exponential equation. That's somewhere on those plans. This micro-camera might be able to play them back for us. Right, that's our only shot. Let's do it, come on. 40 seconds. 39. 38. 37. 36. 35. 34. 33. 32. 31. 30 seconds to disintegration. 29. 28. 27. 26. 25. 24. 23. 22. 21. 20 seconds. 19. 18. 17. 16. 15. 14. 13. 12. 11. 10 seconds. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Disintegration. Funny how the speed of light can seem real slow sometimes, huh? Two and a half seconds for the destruct signal to reach the satellite. Took forever. That's what saved you, us. So, no more gladiators, No more network TV. Where's this little buggy taking us? I have selected the perfect itinerary. God, I thought we were gonna be alone for a second. Sorry, no more itinerary, no more programs, and no more computers. Uh-uh, no. Let it do what it's good at, and let us do what we're good at.
