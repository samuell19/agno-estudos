"A fair lady cries in silence.” "She doesn't know where she is heading to." "Hung-siu steals snow from a frozen river at night.” Bravo. This time, I will tell you a story of... Mr. Thirteen. Mr. Thirteen? Who is he? What is he? Thirty years ago, there was a night, it was terribly cold and dark. The telephone of the police station rang. Listen carefully. This is an emergency call. It was a robbery! Just robbery? It's no big deal. Hey, this is nothing particular nowadays, but at that time, it's something very astonishing! Stop interrupting! Go on. So, many policemen set out for the investigation. They were all armed to carry out the duty. PC228. go up and take a look. Yes sir. Who called the police? Could someone be robbed in such place? Speak up. Who called the police? I did it. You called the police? He stinks! Yes, I did. Are you robbed? Sure. What valuable thing of yours could be robbed? A pair of shoes. Who stole your shoes? Two guys, but you dare not arrest them. Are they superior? Don't you think we dare not arrest them? The one who stole my left shoe is... British. The one who stole my right shoe is... Japanese. They stole all the shoes of Chinese. So we can't even walk. We have no way to go. You nuts! Which fool received the call of this insane guy? It's me. Sorry sir! The whole unit came here to look for his shoes? He called and talked to me in English. That's why I thought he was a foreigner. He speaks fluent English. Nuts, what's your name? Mind your words. You son of the bitch! Sir, he speaks English again! Fluent English indeed. Mister, what's your name? Answer the officer, what's your name? You are so ignorant! My name contains of five Chinese characters. "A Stupid Insane Crazy Guy", right? Crazy? Get him! Pal, what's your name? Please. My name is... "White Phoenix On Snow-capped Mountain". This insane guy... is somebody indeed. He was a famous stage play writer 60 years ago. He was famous for writing stage play of Cantonese opera. His native place was Nanhai of Kwangtung Province. His name was Kiang Yu-kou. He was the thirteenth son of the family, he named himself "Mr. Thirteen of Nanhai" as pen name. Who was he? Why didn't I hear anything about him? What was he? I haven't heard of his name. Kid, when he was famous, you haven't reincarnated yet. About the story of Mr. Thirteen, it's a very long one. His family was a very complicated one. His grandfather was a rich tea merchant. His family was famous in Nanhai. His dad went for government examination in the late Ching Dynasty. And he was appointed as a junior provincial officer. The villagers respected him so much and greeted him Sir. Sir Kiang! Sir Kiang had a weird outlook. He was born in the year of Monkey, he looked like a monkey too. He loved holding banquet to treat his friends. Sir Kiang's snake soup was famous till now. It's delicious! I tried that before. The snake soup which named after Sir Kiang was so famous. Food and sex are two human basic needs. Sir Kiang was famous for his love affairs too. He married... 12 wives. But most of them were ugly. And many were prostitutes before marrying him. They always stayed together and sang. Mr. Thirteen's mom was the sixth concubine of Sir Kiang. Once she delivered Mr. Thirteen, she died! So poor was he! He was extremely naughty too. I wanna beat you to death! You bastard! This day, he was kicked out from school again! He said the headmaster beated the student, he avenged his friends. He burnt the mosquito curtain of the headmaster. Sir Kiang was so mad. He wanted to send Mr. Thirteen to Hong Kong for further studies. This kid had a sharp tongue. We, the new generation supported the May 4th Movement. What movement? What is it? Many youngsters have speech in the streets. Mothers, come and take a look with me. Are you still bull shitting? I wanna kill you! Master, no! Don't hit him, master... Don't stop me! Mister Thirteen. Do we have an opera performance tonight? Yes, Li, Heung and Lai will sing for us tonight. Your 12th mom and I will play music too. May I join you too? None of your business. I wish to watch the opera. If you want to watch the opera, apologize first. What fault have I made? If you don't admit your fault, you can't watch the play. Dad, it's my fault. Dear father. You make me sick. Knees on the floor, you bastard! I have had... Had... Seventeen. No more? I have had 17 children. None of them is as disobedient as you! But you can't tell which child was given birth by which mom. No? Do you know the sex of your 14th children? Dunno? This is my elder brother, who is his mom? I seldom see him! Yes, who is my mom? Am I right? I want you to kneel in front of the ancestors till dawn. No opera tonight. If you don't let me watch the opera, I won't play chess with you. Ale you negotiating with me? You are always defeated by me. You haven't found any way to solve my embattle yet. Just admit to be the loser. No way! I don't think I couldn't defeat you. Well, come on. May I give up two cannons for your sake? No way! Fair race. Time and tides wait for no man! A decade passed. Woo, time really flies! Yes, time changed. In 1903, there was a charity ball held by the Hong Kong University Student Association. All students were from rich families. The gentlemen looked handsome. The ladies were all pretty and decent looking. Kiang! How are you? Not any lady of quality. Kiang! You love dancing too? It's a game of the foreigner. I haven't mentioned that I come for dancing. I could dance but I don't want to dance. Which girl you are falling for? I'll introduce her to you. Liu, I can't imagine that you are so cheap. Ladida, if you don't want to court girl, why do you come here? I come here to study life! This place looks prosperous and pretty. Say, when you are staying in such place, how can one see the fear and threats of China? How can you feel the hidden worries of the Chinese? See, how much have been wasted for this party? How much man power is wasted too? What for? They just want to take this chance to show off. To fight for fame! Pretty woman! Not any lady is of quality! Now, our country is facing internal and external threats. There are so few ladies of quality in China. We want to fight for democracy and freedom. What am I bull shitting? She is my ideal fairy. This is my ideal fairy. What did you say? Miss, are you talking to me? I thought it was illusion! My name is Lily, what's yours? Kiang Yu-kou. No Christian name? No, but if you like, I can name one at once. I am the 13th son of the family, you can call me, Sam. Sam! Buy a lottery ticket for me please. What is it? You talk to me because of selling the ticket? Be good to donate! Yes, but it'll be better if there is another reason for your approach. Say, my outlook attracted you... That's why you came to me. I am sorry. Are you scared? I am a bit frank, but I am not experienced in wooing girls. I can't think of any line to start. May I be excused? Even though I've gone a bit far, you'd appreciate my courage. Sam, I came for I want you to buy tickets from me, just so simple. Take it to me. I buy all. Thank you. So I am free to dance now. Oh, you love dancing! Lily! Coming. Miss Lily. May 17? Do you want to dance with me? For you, I have to devote my... virgin dance to you! You don't know dancing at all. Please wait. OK, I know it now. Can you make it? I've had excellent memory since birth. I was almost called a genius. Genius! Am I a bit short? Use your imagination. Imagine I am modern looking. You are silly. No, I am not silly. Once you are with me, my dream will come true. Now, imagine. Are you happy? I want to write a song for you. Lily, Lily! This is a nice name. You look like an innocent and pretty lily. "You look as sweet as a lily." "Your fragrance attracts the butterfly.” "A pair of swallows are flying happily in heaven.” "You make me live in cloud of cuckoo land." "I wish we would make friends first." "And fall in love forever." "Oh oh, my sweet heart." "I'm captured by your eyes."” "See now I am 10 feet high." "I don't know how it starts." "Love at first sight have you ever learnt?" "Oh my sweet heart." "I'm captured by your eyes..." Kiang Yu-kou was a graduate of Wah Yan College. Did he start composing Anglo-Cantonese Opera? No one knows. Kiang, my cousin promised to dance with you! Is lily your cousin? May I know her address? You are too straight forward! Better behave yourself. I just want to make friends with her! We are cultured! You are outdated, you know? Do you want to woo my cousin? It's late, she is going to Shanghai tomorrow. You bought all tickets from my cousin? Hey, come and collect your money! On the next day, Kiang Yu-kou did appear at the Ocean Terminal. After this morning, he had disappeared for two years misteriously. Daughter, hurry up, we are going to leave. Miss Lily. Don't you recognize me? Sure! I recognize nothing but your spectacles! Well, I will wear this for life. Are you going to Shanghai too? No. I come here to ask you not going to Shanghai. Why? I fall deeply for you. You are so silly. I am not silly. I am a man of love. I love you as the devil loves holy water. Stay and fall in love with me, will you? Daughter, hurry up, the ship is moving. I'm coming. I have to leave now! Bye bye. Kiang? What's next? What's next? Dear neighbours. It's time for tipping! You're under arrest, someone charges you of blocking the traffic. Sir, 1... Cut the crap, or I'll sue you of obstructing police's work. Come on, let him finish telling the story first! No matter what, I have to know the end of the story. Do you have guts? Sir, I don't have any friends or relatives today my bail! Did you assault the police officer? Yes, arrest me too! Follow me! Go ahead! I don't have any mood. Come on. Would Lily be moved by Mr. Thirteen? I think, they would get married once they reached Shanghai. Not that fast! They didn't know each other for long. No, you guessed wrongly. How it goes? Tell us now! Shut up! Can't we chat? Don't you think police is superior? This is a police station. So what? Sir, I am sorry. We are telling story. Come on, let's back to the Kiang's family. In 1932, Kiang's family was no longer that rich. But Sir Kiang was still a spendthrift, he was poor to make money. We have had frequent banquets lately... The concubines and wives suffered. They had to contribute what they got before. Master said, we'd treat the guests the best. If the family's expenditure exceeds the income, he prefers quilting opium. So as to save money for treating his guests. Master is so nice! He is coming... Hide up the jewels. Hurry up... Master... You are all here! You get up so early! It's 3 pm only. I can't fall asleep. General Chan Shing will come soon, is the food ready? Sure! "I have prepared a band for him too." "We will sing..." "For the general's arrival.” Good! Fantastic! Master... Master Thirteen is back. Really? That's great! What's wrong with you? Is he the 13th son of Sir Kiang? Sure! I am sorry! Damn it! Bastard! How dare you! Why don't you beat crimes instead? Shut up! Take him to jail! I haven't had such infilial son! My son has disappeared for two years. He didn't write or send us any message. I am afraid that he was dead. Master... It's alright... Thank you, thank you officers! Cut the crap. You are nagging! I am back, just forget it! OK? Let's not mention what's happened! Please don't ask anything. If you raise any burning question, I will leave immediately. No... you can't leave! What's your plan? Your study in the Hong Kong University has been terminated. You can't be doctor any more. They are all poor fellows, I don't mind. Just one word, I can find my way. Just one word, apologise to your dad right now. I didn't commit any mistake. My mistake is, like father like son! I am so single minded in love! I have my own way. Forget it, don't get mad. I won't blame you of doing anything to me. If you are capable, just teach me a good lesson. Alright, I want you to cry for mercy Fook-loi. Coming, Master. What color do you want? Black! Black chessmen brings bad luck to him. Do you want me to sacrifice both knights? No. You first. I'll move first. I'll bring you some tea. Cannon moves from line two to six horizontally. Cannon moves from line eight to five horizontally. Knight from line two to three forward. Knight from line eight to seven forward. So fast! Chariot from line to two horizontally. Dad, I am impressed! Am I improved? You took 12 wives easily. I just fell for one woman but I couldn't marry her! I am a man of rich love, I am a carefree man. But I am sincere in love. I pay equal love to all my wives. I am responsible to all women. That's why, I have so much burden in my life! By the way, just listen to me... Come on! No! As a matter of love. It's easy to start, if you want to stop, it's so difficult. Most important of all, don't do anything beyond your ability. You lived in Shanghai for two years... Forget it... If you don't want me to remind you anything, I'll keep my mouth shut. Master, here comes your tea. Let's go on. I've just moved the chariot, it's your turn. Soldier from line five to one forward. Why didn't you mask yourself? Do you want to play tricks? Alright, I won't give it a damn! Come on. Mr. Thirteen intended to let this dad win that game. So as to let Sir Kiang forgive him. Later, Mr. Thirteen started teaching in Kwangzhou. But he was still so carefree. He always went to theatre to watch Cantonese Opera. And he started to write stage play for it. The most famous singer at that time was Sit Kok-sin. "The soul of Pear." "Became a great disaster."” Who is he? I heard the name of Sit Kok-sin. The play starred by Sit Kok-sin always attracted full house. "Pity me, the heart breaking letter..." "And heart breaking songs." "I don't want to read the heart breaking letter again."” Brother Five, is there anyone coming for trouble? That guy has sat in front stall for 5 consecutive nights. He always sways his head to count the beat for me. And he always follows me to sing. I thought I was singing something wrong. I think he wants to fool you. I don't think so, he seems to be expert. The fantastic point is, he knows how well I sing! He reacts once I sing badly. But he sits close to me, that's why I can't escape from his eyes. Hey, I still want to watch the opera. It's you! This is Brother Five. Mr. Sit, how are you? I adore you so much! I can't imagine that I have chance to chat with you. Mister, I told them to invite you to the back stage. Even you didn't invite me, I would come to visit you. Mr. Sit, may I be frank. You didn't act well tonight, you were not concentrated. Why? About the presto, you didn't catch it steadily. There must be something affecting you, right? Bastard, how dare you criticize Brother Five? Come on! Someone wants to make trouble here! Stop! Pal, you said correctly. I am... being affected. I think, you know much about Cantonese opera. What ashamed! I didn't know much. But, you can't be blamed. This song isn't easy to sing. There are many notation mistakes in this song. Do you agree? Hey, he is challenging you. Who are you? You come for a mess, don't you? That means, this song is composed by you! Poor arrangement! Drag him out! Throw him to the river! Hey, don't lose your mind! Do you understand? I asked him to come in order to please him. Look, you messed it up! Master. Brother Five. On the following night. Mr. Sit. Hands off! Why do you come again? Mr. Sit, I don't come for trouble. I composed this song. I wish you to read and give me some advice. I will take a look at it. See you then. I blamed myself of being blind... Forget about him. This guy is insane! Get ready for the performance. On the third night. "Heart breaking tears." "Can't get rid of old memories." That bastard is the 13th son of Sir Kiang! Does he know composing song? Take a look. Sir Kiang is famous for his generosity and hospitability. If you are somebody, he will invite you to try this snake banquet. For a chat! If I haven't been invited by Sir Kiang, I am not somebody then. Come on, send this card to Kiang's house. Sure! Hurry up... Our guests are coming. Nice, not bad! Master... Mr. Sit has arrived. Welcome our guest! Welcome! Here he is... Welcome, Mr. Sit! Please go in and take a seat. Sir Kiang is a hospitable person indeed. I am just a singer, but being warmly welcome by you, I am flattered! You are too humble. It's our glory to have your visit. We all are your fans, you know? Welcome Mr. Sit. They are all my mothers. What ashamed! Please come this way, we have a banquet ready for your visit. Thank you. The snake soup of Sir Kiang is really great! What a grand house I have ever seen! Today, I am all eyes! Thank you so much! It's so kind of you. Let's have ate a in the sitting room. Thank you. Mr. Sit, after you. Mr. Sit, please lake a seat. Mr. Sit, can you sing us a song? Please! Please sing us a song! I know some of the madams are great singers too. I dare not show off in front of experts. They sing badly! They are amateur only! Please give us face and give them chance to learn! Well. I would love to take this order. Sit down please. Sir Kiang. I'll sing a song "Fish in Snow" composed by your son. His song? Yes, I couldn't hold loving it after reading the whole script. This is an excellent love song That I've ever met. My son is in-experienced in composing songs, please advise him! It's too humble of you! Please listen. "In my heart.” "That kind of sad feeling...” "Is only known by myself." "The half moon..." "Hints incomplete family to me." "Not any message is received." "I am puzzled.” I would like to invite your son to join my troupe. To be my stage play writer, what do you think? My son is being appreciated by you, It's my glory! Thirteen did a glorious thing at last. Thank Mr. Sit now. A man would die for his real friend. I will compose songs which are tailor made for you only. Remember, my plays must be righteous and moral ones. My songs must be meaningful. Great. I want a pen name. What name? I am the thirteenth son of the family. From now on, I'll name myself... Mr. Thirteen of Nanhai. Brother Thirteen, there are so many flowers for you today! Brother Thirteen. Brother Thirteen! Who are you? My name is Fung, the manager of the Woo Ping Theatrical Troupe. What's the matter with you? Mr. Ma, my boss appreciates your songs so much. Mr. Ma? I don't adore very much! He sings like a beggar! Mr. Ma would like you to give him face, so that he could treat you tea. He wants me to be his stage play writer, doesn't he? What a wise guy, we do want to employ you with high pay. Shut up! I won't go even you pay me a large sum of money. See you. Mister Thirteen, this You know Mister Sit give me chance to start my career. Now, Sit and Ma are two different opposing parties. You asked me to help Ma? How can I explain to Mr. Sit? What will my buddies say behind me? Mr. Thirteen... Well, please tell Mr. Ma, tell him that... I... will... never... work... for him for... any... pay! Chin Li-kui, don't cry! Dragged actress isn't popular now. Time is different now. I know, but if I have to retire in this way, I will never satisfy with such fatal arrangement! I sing well, I act well! I'm better than those female actresses! Please help me to write a play. Why do you stare at me? Don't you think a dead fish can swim? You are disgusting! Don't angry! Alright, I've got an idea. So fast! Don't you think you are gifted? Or do you know magic? Come and act with Five. But Ma, Sit and me are the famous triangle. Come on, this is specially written for you. When will my man home? It's a tragedy about a decent widow! It fits you most. Come to us, Five will love acting with you. I'll count on you! Eat something first. Brother Thirteen, this way please. It's alright... Come on. This is the most famous script writer in the film industry. A genius of only 26 years old, Brother Thirteen. Come often! You look smart, Brother Thirteen! They are not the one I want. I come for May Sen. May Sen? She is real busy! She is the most popular club girl of us. Money makes the world go round. If you get me May Sen, you'll get the money. Please wait. How are you? You are May Sen, aren't you? I heard that you come specially for me! Thanks so much! What's your name? Kiang. What is your job? It's a decent job! You have your tongue in your cheek. I don't think you are a frequent visitor here. Do you smoke? No. I can't tell you are only seventeen! Yes when I started working as c1ubgirl. Now I am eighteen. Why don't you do something else but a club girl? This is a place for fun. In such place... why do you preach instead of having fun? Are you a teacher? Come on, take off your mask! Who do you think you are? You are a man only! What are you doing? Hands off! You are going to pot! You bored me! Goodnight. Freeze. I am not free to serve you! Do you know who I am? I don't care. Do you remember my surname? Kiang! So what? My surname is Kiang too. Your name is Kiang? Bad girl! Your father is my third brother! I am your 13th uncle! Help yourself! Do you want to leave like this? Are you called Kiang Siu-yee? Are you the eighth daughter? Eighth daughter! Uncle Thirteen, nice to meet you. I come specially for you. You don't recognise me of course. When we met last time, you were only five or six years old. Kiang's family is a decent family you know? Why do you work as club girl? My dear uncle. You know my father is a spendthrift. If I don't work as clubgirl, who will pay the living of my family? It's not bad. Many people come to me every night. I have good food, I wear nice dresses. How about when you are old? If I don't work as club girl, I will get old too. Stand up! Now, I have another choice for you. I'll introduce you to star in the films, what do you think? You need to perform too, but it's more decent! You need to act. I think you know acting very well. What's your name? Chan San-fung. Spell CHAN. We don't care the spelling. Cut the crap, start now. Screen test by Chan San-fung, starts. What did she sing? Cut... next! Go... next. When I get famous, you will suffer! Let's wait and see! Next. Who's next? Sorry, may I use something as prop? Thank you. What's your name? May Sen. "My heart breaks." "I've become a hooker." "From street to street,” "I have to serve men every day." "I've suffered for ten years.” "Cause my family's sudden change.” "I have changed, my heart has changed." "I regret to be a hooker." Cut. Ask the manager to register her name. Wait, who introduced this girl to us? It's me. She is my niece. I will make her a super star. So, Kiang Siu-yee left the club, and jumped to another field which somewhat resembles a club. Let's start with the play "The Declination of Five Dynasties". Well, start from a presto, come on. "I am a loyal general” "I must kill all the invaders." "Heroic sense drives me to fight bravely against enemies.” "Bravo!" Pause, Brother Thirteen, it's enough. What a dumb bell! Next. Hung-siu, the thief, line for Hung-siu. Did I write the lines for her? Not yet. Well, start now. "Hero, thank you for saving me from devils." "But I don't know what should I do next." Kwun-lun continues. "Don't worry, I've arranged it." "If you don't mind, I would like to give you a ride.” Brother Thirteen, I can't catch you, slow down please. Banana skin. What did you say? You slipped! Next one. Story of Chun Wai. The scholar is held by his servant. Give him a presto first. "I haven't fallen in love." "Staring at the moon, I am just long waiting." "It makes me feel miserable." "Miserable..." Brother Thirteen. What's next to the line "What's next"? "What's next"? How do I know? Whom should I ask? If I remember, why are you hired? I can't remember! What's after "Puzzled"? I can tell you are puzzled from your face. How can you be a script writer? You can't even copy! Our hands are not faster than your mouth! You must use your brain, what a fool! After "Hung-siu the thief", after "The story of Chun Wai". Then back to you! You can't even catch it. Brother Thirteen, the lines are too long! We can't catch it. You bastards. So, am I wasting my time to sing? Am I wasting my time to speak? Am I bull shitting? You are sick! Brother Thirteen! You sing too fast! You are sick! Get lost! All of you get lost! You are fired! Get lost! Three Ps, six Os and three Rs. What do you mean? Poor, poor, poor! All together three Ps, six Os and three Rs! Get lost! Alright, we are leaving! I'll spread your bad temper! See anyone would work for you! Go to hell! You are nuts! Brother Thirteen. Uncle Fan is having stomach ache, he asked me to replace him. Come in. I think he is afraid of working for me. Are you taking his place? Yes, I have been longing for this chance! I sing quickly, can you catch me? Sure, no problem. Cut the crap, see where were we up to. It's the song sung by the female lead. She sings, "Oh, it reds my cheek..." "I feel like riding on BP road," What BP road? What is BP? Fan should write bumpy road! BP? Fan is illiterate! Bumpy road! It sounds great. I feel like riding on bumpy road. Let me write it down. Well, start now. It's the line of the lead Ngai Chiu-yan. Chiu-yan. Followed by the line of the female lead. First, sung by Ngai Chiu-yan. "On the way to success, I haven't taken off my robe yet." "I am proud of myself for winning the war."” "So glad to attend the celebration party held by His Majesty." "To praise the triumph I've contributed." Have you finished? Don't you think you're a good singer? After the word "River”, change the melody. Melody changed. Brother Thirteen? So? Can't you catch it? No, about the word "praise”, why don't you use the word "appreciate"? "Praise" is too cocky. You know nothing! This lead is an arrogant person, a "paint face". That's why he is cocky! Better learn. The lead is a paint face? This part is nice! - Do you know flexibility? - Flexibility! The female lead follows. Start. "How arrogant you are!" "Remember when you were in danger?" "Who risked his life to drive the enemies away," "and saved your life?" "Someone doesn't want to fight for fame with you." "But you want to show off in front of us now!" Next song. Your Majesty, thank you for your hospitability. Thank you for your kindness. Men, set the dinner! Next song. Followed by Ching. Then, line by the prince. "We need someone to entertain us." Pause. "Why not ask my daughter to dance for us?" Pause. "Men, ask Her Highness to dance for us.” Your Highness please. Alright. Chiu-ying sings. The song "Platonic Love" "Platonic Love." What lyrics should be filled? I am thinking. How about the song "Drunken Woman"? "Red castanets sound softly..." Damn it! You are sissy looking! What a big mouth! If I don't try, how can I learn from you, Brother Thirteen? I prefer the song "Selling Love", so what? "Selling Love". "I wish to see him but I am shy!" "I feel happy but I am shy.” "Hope God of Love would bring me a good husband.” "I pray in silence."” "I walk to the banquet..." "I walk to the banquet..." "I walk to the banquet..." "The dew wets my shoes." Shoes are wet. Does it sound good? Bravo! Good boy. I just want to learn from Brother Thirteen! Everyone wants to learn from me. I mean it. If you don't mind, please take me as your student. Why should 1? Cause I am sincere! So what? I won't take any student. Are you despising me of not well educated? I graduated from the Art Institute in Shanghai. I came back to Kwantzhou after the 128 Incident. Brother Five gave me chance to arrange his songs. But I really want to write script alone. I am bad tempered! Do you still want me to be your teacher? I am a bright and pleasant person. You have bad tempered, I am mild, we've broken even. Alright, bring me a cup of tea. Yes sir! Master... This is for you. Drink it. If you drink it, I'll take you as student. Dare you drink it? I am just kidding! You silly kid! I tell you. A good cat won't breed. Haven't you heard of it? I won't give birth to babies. Do you want me to take you as student? Stop dreaming! What did you say? I said nothing. Are you blaming me deep inside your heart? Yes. What did you blame? Damn you! You arrogant devil! Don't you think you are something? Anything else? Yes. Wait for it! I will be more famous than you. I would be more successful than you. Freeze. Good boy. You are affectionate! You have guts! These are the basic requirements to be a scriptwriter. Get another cup of tea for me. Go now! Brother Thirteen, this is your tea. How old are you? Twenty Where is your hometown. I am a Cantonese, but I was born in the Amur River. What's your name? My name is... Tong Dik-sung. That's why you look like people in the North. Promise me, don't you ever call me Master in front of other, I am ♪ years older than you, greet me brother. Yes, Master. Yes. Brother. Well, our friendship is tied up with this cup of tea. I don't want you to write such rubbish. What you wrote are same as mine! You are imitating! Read all these plays first. Why? You are literate. You needn't write such vulgar play to please the audiences. You write such kind of play too. I am different. My age differs yours. Those who watch my plays are usually illiterate. If I use difficult vocabulary, they won't understand. Look forward. The standard of the audiences are getting higher and higher. It's useless to copy me. Learn, but don't copy. What does that mean? It's useless to Imitate. Even you do the best imitation, that'll be my script only. Learn from me, and change it to be your own creation. Then you'll get famous! "Poverty harms one's ego!" "I have to sell my sword in order to earn a living." "Selling my sword..." "I wanna sell the treasure of my family." Brother, your "Woman's Fragrance" has been shown for a year... in Kwangzhou, Hong Kong and Macau. It's a great show! I want to be as famous as you, brother. Why do you always want to be a famous scriptwriter? I want to prove that, written articles worth much! Three or five decades later, no one will remember those share certificates. Gold, stock, shares and big events will all be over. But a worth reading script, will always be appreciated even though it passes through a century. Even I die, my name and the play I have written won't be forgotten. This is the value of written articles. What an arrogant guy! I am no match for you. Arrogance! I haven't worked better than my master. You always dream of being famous, you can't write good play. Go On August 23, 1937, Japanese bombed Shanghai. Kwantzhou was threatened too. All the troupes were dismissed. Let's say goodbye right here. Keep contact when you reach home. China will get the victory, she will. China will get the victory. See you. Well, my brother, see you. Go. What? Brother... You should go to Hong Kong. I want to follow you. Are you crazy? Are you kid? Why do you follow me? I wanna follow you to anywhere you go. I am going to hell, are you coming too? I stay in Kwantzhou, you, go to Hong Kong. I have suffered for three years, I can stand you no more! Brother. We are two different kinds of people, cut the crap. Be frank, I haven't appreciated you. You are too big for your boots. It's useless to flatter me. If you have pride, try to get famous in Hong Kong. It's better to be a follow dog. And, don't tell others that you have learnt from me. It'll embarrass me! You know? Thirteen, why are you so heartless to him? At this time... Shut up, Five, you know nothing. Tong will have bright future. I'll be his hindrance if he follows me. I am not qualified to be his teacher. Why are you so humble. Mr. Thirteen is too tough. Yes. What's next? Dead! Dead? I said I am dying! I am so thirsty! No problem, what's next? Have a cup of tea please. It's so kind of you. Want some biscuits? Come on. I am touched, Miss. Where was Aunt Thirteen? Where did she go? Aunt Thirteen went with Wong Fai-hong! Mr. Thirteen joined the 7th troop. Did he want to fight with the Japanese? He wrote script to entertain and encourage the soldiers. He always did some crazy things in his life. This time... shit! "Men are strong.” "People are united." "We have to protect our homes..."” So many people come to watch me, Sun Len-chou. "Let's march forward." I am going to encourage the people. Dear fellows. Let's fight together. Against the evil invasion by the Japanese. Long life to China. Let's sing the patriotic songs for our beloved country. "Men are strong.” "People are united." "We want to protect our country.” "We don't mind bleeding."” "We go forward to fight for peace.” "Let's march forward." "Look, look, look, there is a beauty in the mountain.” "Ha Ha Ha, she is bitchy and pretty.” "Hear hear hear, she sings like a nightingale.” "Dance dance dance, she twists with drunken steps.” "You shouldn't hide your love." What the hell is it? Yam Sik-fa and his troupe comes to entertain the 8th troop. "Let's forget the restrictions.” "Let's dance happily with the butterflies.” This woman is seducing the soldiers instead of encouraging them. Can they still go to fight? They have to wash their eyes. Nonsense! What a mess. Do you agree, Sun Len-chou? Brother Thirteen, they show the soldiers sexy. Bombs! The sexy bombs are really attractive! Alright, do you love women? I'll change the script. Sure, change it. "It's not late to devote myself to the country.” "China will be strong..." "Hold the gun, we won't retreat.” "China will be strong."” "Let's fight..." Hold the gun and go to fight. Pretty women! Their thighs are really attractive. "My beautiful country...” It's killing me! Go and take a look! "China will be strong!" What a corrupted world! I'd better go to Hong Kong to star in the Wong Fai-hong series. See you. "Hold the gun and fight." "China will be strong..." "Hold the gun, we won't retreat.” "China will be strong."” Go in... Get lost... Who is Yam Sik-fa? Come out. Why do you mess up here? Are you Yam Sik-fa? Are you Mr. Thirteen of Nanhai? Don't you feel shame to entertain like this? You entertain your troop, I entertain mine. None of your business. Be smart and leave, or I'll teach you a good lesson. You are seducing the soldiers! How can they fight with the Japanese? You are bringing troubles and disturbing the soldiers! You bastard! You have less audiences than me, so you want a mess up, right? Be smart and leave, the general will come to watch my show soon. Betrayer! I wanna kill you! I wanna Kill you betrayer! Yam Sik-fa's boss, General Yu is so generous. You gave him a blow first. Forget it, just apologise to Yam. Peace brings money. I don't want to make money in time of war. Go. Are you coming to apologise? Hold the cup with both hands. My script seduces the soldiers, it harms the soldiers. How about you? You encourage loyalty to the emperor. We have no emperor nowadays. You are stiff-minded! Pal, retire please, you are out-dated. Take me the tea. It's a bit cold, I'll bring you hot tea. Drink while it's still hot! Go to hell, bastard! You betrayer! I wanna bite you to death. Are you crazy? It kills me! I am not mad, you are mad! You are all crazy! What did you say? Drama is used as a leading light for people. My play show others a bright and right way. I teach others to be righteous and heroic. Yam Sik-fa, what script did you write? Once there are people of your kind in China, what hope do we have? What future do we have? You are not a man of the world, you are crazy. Hands off, I want to kill him! Yam Sik-fa should be beaten. Better give him some more punches. It's not better but worst! This incident was spread to the South. Some people didn't like Thirteen at all. They always blamed him of his arrogance. After the war, everyone went back to show business. But no one wants his stage play, they are scared by his bad temper. What do you think? It's written by me. It's funny! Here comes the female lead. Help... Here comes the female lead. "So poor am I..." "Who will pity me?" "I kneel in front of the gorilla.” "I can't help crying..." Stop... The gorilla kidnapped the woman, what's next? The woman got pregnant. 18 years later, her son broke the mountain and saved its mother. That is a revised version of the "Pauline Lamp”. How can you figure it out? I can't help. After the war, the audiences want entertainment. I have to think something new to attract them. New? That's why you have "Lady crab messing up the water palace". "Gandhi meets Sai-see". "Hitler VS Lun Sheung-yu". Brother Thirteen, please help me. The script writer who started this script courted a rich old woman. They went to America. That's why he stopped writing this script, please help me. Why don't you find someone else to finish it for you? Well. Since everyone is busy except me, right? I'll finish it within three days. Shit! "You gorillas!” "It goes smoothly.” "You beasts!” "Damn you beasts!" "How dare you try to rape?” "I am being insulted." "You want to rape me?" "How can I stand such insult?" "You scared me." "Please listen to me, brother gorillas.” "Don't be a hard-hearted guy." "Why not fight for our beloved country?" "To kill our enemies?" "Don't give up your future.” "Let's go to fight against the papioes.” "Let's fight together.” "Our will is as strong as steel.” "The papioes are invading us." "We are ants on hot pot." "We should think something to solve our problem." "Please don't stick to your own desire." "Co-operate to fight for our homes." "Let's go to fight with the papioes.” "We break the obstacles with our own blood." "We won't retreat by any means.” "Women go to battlefield with the gorillas.” One two three! Stop! What's wrong? Brother Thirteen, it's war again! Women can fight, even animals can be righteous, what's wrong? The gorillas are going to fight with Japanese. We have just got peace. The audiences are all afraid of war. Let's change a bit. I changed. I am willing to write script starred by gorillas! I would never write such horrible play before the war. Why not create a dramatic ending? Offer kind ones a happy ending, give bad guys punishment. Well, poor ending for nasty people. That means, you can write as cheap as you can before the ending? Let's forget the monkeys. Better ask the female lead... What do you suggest? You, take off your clothes for strip dance. It's new! We haven't seen strip dance in Cantonese Opera. Better arrange some hell servants to appear before the ending. To escort the female lead to hell, as punishment. So, you can create cheap scenes as you like. Well you... I still have some more ideas. This time, strip dance. Next time, shave the hair, and then peel her skin off. You are ridiculous! Am I ridiculous? I won't change my script, if you want a change, find someone else. You are ridiculous! That's why no one wants to hire you. What did you say? I am telling the truth. Which troupe hires you to write stage play? You are disgusting, extremely disgusting! If you have guts, repeat. So? Do you want to beat me? I am not Yam Sik-fa, I won't let you beat me. I just want to beat you now! What's up? Return the play to me. You are really disgusting! I don't think I would starve to death. You would starve to death! Malay cake, barbecue bun... What are you looking at? You haven't eaten for half day. I love eating any time I like, none of your business. You need not be that fierce! Cake Wait, come back. What are you selling? Cake, Malay cake and barbecue bun. I don't want it. Cake... Wait, come back. Do you have bastard bun? Leave me alone! Cake. You must be the scriptwriter with long name. "Mister Thirteen of Nanhai", are you? No. I have a longer name. Extremely disgusting Mr, Thirteen of Nanhai, How are you? I am Chan from the Peace Troupe. Mister Ma wants me to employ you to write script for him, Have you heard of sincerity? Ask him to come to me directly. Brother Thirteen, Mister Ma has given you enough face, His play named "Crazy for you"... is so popular now, it's broken all records. Don't you think he doesn't know you teasing his beggar like voice? He doesn't mind it but tries hard to find you. He knows I am ill-fated now, no one comes for me. That's why he pities me, right? That's good. If I were you, I would renew the situation between Ma and you. Write a script to let him examine. Let him examine? Is this your idea or is it his idea? Shit! I haven't begged anyone. Sit Kok-sin sang whatever I wrote. To be examined by Ma? If he doesn't have faith, don't come to me. What a nuisance! Don't bother me. You are sick! That's why everyone dislikes you. I heard that you are jobless lately. I heard you are the most famous star. You sing Chinese Opera too, can you handle it? I don't hate money. I can pay someone to teach me singing. If this is that easy, people don't need to waste years of learning. Those who studied for years are wasting time, right? Let's shift to another topic. Are you interested in writing a film script for me? Someone promised to pay for it, we can start shooting any time. I recommended you, my boss promised to hire you. Why do you help me? If you can't make it, it's useless to help. Unless, you can't make it. Can you? Do you want to provoke me? Am I fit to write that film? Love in time of war, it fits you. My pen goes rusty. Uncle Thirteen, remember what you told me? Chance is just in front of you. If you give up, you must regret for it. I've brought the money. Will you act according to my script? Sure. Auntie, where is Yu-heung? She is dead. Yu-heung! She wanted to protect herself... from being raped by the Japanese... she thus committed suicide! Yu-heung! - What's wrong? - Brother Chung-leung. She is alive! She is alive! I am so glad! Damn it! Stop it. Turn on the light! Who amended my script? Which bastard amended my script? I did it. How come Yu-heung back to life? Romeo and Juliet? Or sleeping beauty? Chung-leung fought with the Japanese, why was he back? I am the director of this film, I love amending it. What kind of director are you? Shit! You don't value script at all. A script is the soul of drama. You know the importance of script? Don't pretend to be expert! Better change your job! Shut up! I am the director, I have authority to amend the script. What a childish script. The audience would tease me! I won't allow this film to be shown! Uncle Thirteen. Don't call me Uncle. You are all bad stuffs, I wanna burn the negative. Get him! How dare you rob the negative? Are you triad? Bastard, do you want any trouble? Stop! Give me face please. Get lost. Drag him out! Let me go. Bitch, I want to stop my relationship with you. As much as you offer. [t doesn't worth much. I just want enough money to buy a ticket back to Kwangzhou. Just give me a hand. Are you blind? Daredevil, you are so careless! You bumped against me! Why are you that fierce? You are blind. you deserve it! You dog! What a snob! What did you say? Dare you repeat? Dog! Shing, stop it, we are in hurry, let's move. Mister, are you alright? Don't you think rich people are superior? What do you want? Lily. Kiang Yu-kou, it's you! How are you? I have just come back from USA, how about you? I am busy too. I have to write stage play for Cantonese opera as well as film scripts. Everyone wants me to write scripts for them! Extremely busy. I am tired too. Congratulations! What a successful scriptwriter! You are mature now. I have changed. Have you regretted of not marrying me? My husband is rich. He has an American passport. That's why you broke my heart. You let me stay in Shanghai alone! I am sorry. It's hard to find true love, I know. Let's start all over again. It's |late. Why? What's up? We hurt this guy. He is a beggar, forget about him. Are you married? What are you doing? Tell me, are you married? Damn it! Give him some money for treatment. Let's go. I think I saw him somewhere before. There are beggars all around, let's go! Impossible, she could recognize me! At least, she must remember my spectacles. She praised that before. Why? Why? Why didn't you appear earlier? Why did you appear just now? Why did you appear when I was most ill-fated? Pal, what do you want? Come down, what do you want? Someone jumped from the train... His brain was in shock, it's not easy for him to regain memory. So what can we do, doctor? It's lucky for being alive. Why do you catch me? Why it become a mess? If I was as rich as before, I'd have wasted all my money to treat you. But now... Who are you? Are you dumb? Why didn't you say a word? - Honey! - Where is Thirteen? "Like a flying eagle..." Come down, why do you climb up? "I wanna fly!" Come down, you will fall to death! "I wanna fly!" Are you hurt? I can't fly, I fail. So, come and play chess with me. I'll give up two cannons for you. I'll give up two knights. You first. So, I will win for sure. You will lose. Hey, if you lose, you have to scratch my back. Alright, but if you lose, you have to bath. You stink and you are so dirty, don't you feel it? "All men stink!" "Stinky men." "Fragrant women." "If a man doesn't stink," "how can you feel the fragrance of a woman?" You are not insane, you remember the song you composed. You teased me, I won't play with you. You are not insane! I am insane! Your chariot is over. What is it? How can you play in this way? You didn't mention this rule beforehand. No way, let's start a new game. No way, you have to admit your failure. You didn't mention that rule beforehand. Rice become shit after eating, can you eat that again? Of course. Dare you eat it? I dare. Honey. He is a wise guy. Do we have any red cloth? Hang one outside. What's the matter? There is a parade, people said Kwangzhou is liberated. Take a piece of red cloth out. Chinese won't fight against Chinese. We have to kill all those betrayers. Kill those dogs! Kill those who don't know how to write scripts. Kill Yam Sik-fa. Who is Yam Sik-fa? I think it must be the woman he has fallen for. I am not Yam Sik-fa. Checkmate. You are defeated! I intended to shift your attention, you know? Scratch my back now. But you are so dirty. He always bull shit in Kwangzhou, I worry that he would have trouble sooner or later. Forget it, let's think something. Send him to Hong Kong. After 1950, someone found... Mr. Thirteen in Hong Kong. He always appeared in Central, round Rocky Road & Wing Gut Street. He dressed like a beggar. He had no home and always babbled. He became a homeless wanderer. Uncle Thirteen? Uncle Thirteen! Uncle Thirteen... I'm being kidnapped! Uncle Thirteen, master is longing for seeing you! Come with me! I am kidnapped! Uncle Thirteen, here we are. Let's go to meet master, come on. Pal! Master, I've found Uncle Thirteen. Thirteen, what's wrong with you? Am I familiar with you? I've asked people to look for you! Where are you living now? Where do I live? I live in street. In street? It's so comfortable! Sky is my blanket, the floor is my bed. It's cooler than this place. He stinks. Yes... Thirteen, you are sick, you know? Old man, do you know me? I am not Old Man, I am Five, Sit Kok-sin. Why are you named Five? I am the fifth son of the family, I am greeted as Brother Five. Five! Sit Kok-sin, do you remember? Yes, I do. Uncle Thirteen! It's so dirty! Throw it away! Robbery! Ask Sister Kwai to set our dinner. Yes. Master. Thirteen! Listen. This guy sings well. This song is composed by you. "Fish in frozen river", remember? Actually, we didn't know each other. One day, you brought the script to the backstage to look for me. This play! It's famous all over Kwangzhou, Hong Kong and Macau. Everyday full house! You got famous immediately! Remember? Yes. Really? Yes. You are called Five. I didn't use my brain, and I remember nothing. Now I use my brain, I remember it. How are you? Five. Thirteen, knowing your poor situation, I feel so upset. What you have seen isn't true. I said, what you haven't seen is true. What are you doing? I wanna buy another pair of glasses for you, see, no glass in it. In fact, it's not necessary to see life clearly. Just take it easy. If you want to see clearly. Look at this side, right? If you don't want to see it any more, look at the other side. It'll be painful if you see everything clearly. Look at you! You are so painful. Come on, scratch my back please, thank you. You stink terribly. Get him some water for his bath please. I don't want bathing. How long haven't you bathed? I always bath. I wash my heart! We people only need a clean heart. That's enough. Get me a tub of water, I just want to drink a mouthful of it. Cut the crap. Don't sleep in street, sleep here. I'll buy some clothes for you. And I'll get you a doctor to cure you. What are you doing? Shit! I want to shit. Sister Kwai, hurry up. Take Thirteen to toilet. Follow me. Master... The beggar ran away. Why didn't you drag him back? I couldn't make it. He threw me with shit! Look! I am driven mad! Get him back. Master, it's useless. You can keep him for one day, but you can't keep him forever. You can't lock him up. Tell our buddies that, if they see Uncle Thirteen, just give him some money. We should take care of him. Tell the owners and waiters of Lin-heung and Luk Yu Restaurants, if Thirteen eats there, just let him eat. Tell them that I'll pay the bills for him in the end of the month. Yes, Master, don't worry. Thirteen is insane, but he is my benefactor indeed. He wrote me many great plays! They are really excellent! Cheung, what's next? Go ahead... Cheung. Go ahead. Damn it! Sik Kok-sin promised to pay for Thirteen, so Thirteen went to Luk Yu Restaurant for tea oftenly. The boss hired an Indian to stop him from entering. But they couldn't make it. Follow me to eat buns. Greet him daddy, he is insane. He is my dad, so he is your grand-father then. Good! You don't need to give them face. Let me take a look. Return it to me. Return it to you? You take it as your treasure! Let me take a look. If it breaks, you can't afford paying for it. It's only a piece of white paper. Mister Thirteen, please give me face. You will scare my customers away. It's a piece of paper only! Take it back! Damn it. This is called "White Phoenix on snow-capped mountain". Can you read it? You fool. What's as now-capped mountain phoenix? I can see nothing on it! Let's go. We don't want to drink their tea with urine added! Do you eat shit of cockroach? What did you say? Don't listen to him, it's only black bean. Are you called Siu-eheung? Sleep here tonight. Leave early tomorrow morning. I hate kids so much! This phoenix is nicely drawn! It seems like flying. What stone is it standing? It's not stone! It's mountain! Snow-capped mountain. Thick snow, huh? Why the phoenix is pecking at its feather? Of course, it's cold. It needs to warm itself by moving. There is an egg. It's big. Of course, it lays egg once every 3000 years, it must be big. What else do you see? Shit, the snow is melting! Nuts. Nuts. Nuts... Go on. - Little worm! - Bee. Did my son Kill? What crime did he commit? Shut up... Take him to pay the bail. Go now. Here comes the officer. No hurry, listen the story first. What's next? Later, Mr. Thirteen didn't go to Luk Yu Restaurant for tea. Where did he go? Lin-heung Restaurant. You turn the paper upside down, can you read it? I intended to read like this! Do you know English? The North and South Vietnam are going to start a war, you kid! You are stupid! Mister Thirteen was a famous scriptwriter before the war. Once he was a medical student of the Hong Kong University. But he didn't graduate. Mister Thirteen, eat anything you like, I'll record it. No, I have money today. Really? It's given by the governor. Bribery money (Public allowance). Boss. He doesn't want me to blame the poor efficiency of the British. You have nothing but a spittoon. It's great to clear my throat. Mister Thirteen. The man inside challenges you that, if you write lyrics for this song, he will come out to treat you 3 glasses of wine. If you can't, you'd better leave as far as you can. What? I was just telling you the words he said. How difficult is this song? He is too big for his boots. You can't even afford buying this golden pen, you know? Shit! Spittoon... Rainy night. This is an ancient song! Doesn't he think I know nothing? When I composed song, you were still a baby. Stop bluffing! You nuts! Alright, I'll play with you! Better learn. "Meeting you is like a dream!" "We are so close but it seems so far between us." "It's a piece of cake! Nothing difficult!” "To meet my benefactor again, my heart is breaking." "It seems that his sword is buried deep under mud and earth.” "Where is his will and his talent?" "Like snow in the river." "I see nothing but my tears.” Mister Thirteen, go on. Go on. "I disappoint you." "Don't be self-abased.” "It's hard to meet best friend of mine." "Such a genius." Brother Thirteen. Leave this table to him, I'm leaving. Brother Thirteen. Brother You mistook me as someone Come on, it's hard for me to find you! Thank you, Mr. Tong Mr. Tong, I love watching the play you wrote. Brother. You are great Right, I've got rich and famous now. But why have I made it? It's all because of you. I didn't teach you anything. Yes, you have, do you forget or don't you want to remember? When I was your student, I told myself. Even I didn't learn your talent. I should make myself be as proud as you. Look at you. I feel so sad, Brother! I am leaving. Dare you tell me you are very happy now? You can't cheat yourself, you can't cheat me, too. Listen to me. I am leaving. Just listen to me. When did you become that fierce? Time changed! Now, I am the teacher. Got it? "You know I have worked hard." "I can't stop myself from looking for you." "Don't give up yourself." "It a chance to meet you again!” Our friendship is tied up by this cup of tea. Come on, take the money. I don't want it. Clean yourself up, from head to toes. What for? I am not going to see anyone. I want you to see the outside world. Tomorrow, there will be a performance by Sen Fung Ming. Yam and Sen would be very happy to see you. Oh, it's you! The shadow vanished with the rain and wind. The soul would never return. What the hell is it? Tong Dik-sung fainted because of heart attack. "The sound of drum reminded me that it's midnight.” "Shower and thunder storm covered the half moon." Tong! Tong. He is my student! Even he is your father, you have to give way. "The King of Hell sent his order.” "The room suddenly turned to be guillotine.” "The Officers of Hell rode with wind." "Suddenly, the scholar was pulled deep under the sea of blood.” Tong Dik-sung was the most famous stage play writer after the war. He was the remarkable master of that age. In 1959, he died during the first show of his famous play "Reincarnation of Red Plum" He died when he was only 43 years old. Tong! Tong! Tong! On that night, Mr. Thirteen shouted and screamed in the police station. People took him as an insane man and put him to lunatic asylum. He spent five years there. Bye bye, I'll be back soon. Female lead. Right, you look like a female lead. I'll come back to teach you singing. May-sen? May-sen is dead, I am Kiang Siu-yee. You believed in Jesus! Thank God for letting me see you recover. Follow me. Where are you taking me to? To our church, to turn a new leaf. No! I am busy. Uncle Thirteen, listen to me. Our previous generation was a mess. So, we have to think and reflect. Come on, let's pray together. Pray together. Sen. Kiang Siu-yee. Why do you push me to believe in Jesus? I don't know him very well. Believe in God and you can go to heaven. Do you want to go to heaven? Heaven? To me, it's too far away. Here is my heaven. See, so many angels around. Don't insult Jesus. I think it's you who is insulting Jesus. You want me to see Jesus with no reason. He may not have time to see me. Believe in God, so we can have eternal life. Eternal life? It's too painful! One can't die even one wants to end his life! I don't want it. Only nuts would love never ending life. I think you are insane! Uncle Thirteen, where are you going? I want to shit! I can't stand any more, don't follow me. Stop! Don't come close to me. Go... Follow me, this way, this way! Welcome to the Pauline Temple. This is the Big Buddha. Is the biggest in Hong Kong. Please accept these donations from all of us! Oh! Thank you! Your donation will bring you happiness and good fortune. About the Buddha? It's a long story. Once upon a time in India... In India? What you mean is China? Not China. This crazy guy is good at serving the foreign tourists! He is normal sometimes. He speaks fluent Cantonese. English, German and French. We've got more and more foreign currency as donation. Pound and Reich mark, almost all sorts of foreign currency. That's what we said, human's heart is same as Buddha's heart. Once linked, incense and donations would be more and more. Little monk, come... This is for you and Hin-ching. Tips. Great. Remember to scratch my back at night. No problem. Sorry, master, I want to do a sacrificial ceremony. Little monk, business here. He's just left. Come on... Do you want to do a sacrificial ceremony? Yes, for releasing a soul. For releasing a soul? Your relative? He was my master. What's his name? Where did he live? Please write as follows. Sir Kiang Hung-yan of Nanhai. Is that clear? You are... I'm his servant. Please write, it's from Lam Fook-loi. Are you ready? When did he die? When? In details please. It's about 1958, there were lots of movements in China. My master was liquidated. People claimed him to be landlord. They wanted to judge my master. My master didn't admit himself be anti-revolutionaries. He refused to eat in jail, he suicide by not eating anything. My master didn't harm anyone when he was alive. He was that old. What an aggrieved soul! Mister, your voice seems familiar to me, may I know your hometown? Nanhai. I see. So you must have heard of Kiang's family. Yes. My master ate much precious food when he was alive. Who could imagine that, he starved to death at last? What's wrong with your eyes? Someone made me blind by pepper. They said I was my master's dog, I protected my master. Mister, I'll pay you more. Please ask them to pray more for my master. Mister. Mister... Nuts! Where are you going to? I have to go back to Hong Kong Island. Have you asked the master? Easy come, Easy go, too! Old Mr. Thirteen... lived in the lunatic asylum twice. He lived in the temple for three years. For the rest of time, he wandered off in streets. He started to be insane when he was 38 years old. Sometimes he was normal, sometimes, he was crazy. Was he real crazy or not? I think, he just pretended to be crazy. I think he was real crazy. Sometimes he was real crazy and sometimes not. No matter what, he is a genius. But I tell you, don't take yourself be a genius. Why? Cause there are two endings for real genius. One is dying young, like Tong Dik-sung. The other ending is go crazy, tragic ending. I don't understand. Since genius won't get compromise with the common world. When did Mr. Thirteen die? I don't know, I haven't seen him for ages. I saw him once. Let me finish the story. It was 1984. A night which was terribly cold. Sir, it's him. He freezed to death. It's him! Sir, do you know him? He is an insane guy! I saw him once. It was about 20 years ago. He called the police and said that his shoes were stolen. Who stole his shoes? He said, "The British stole my left shoe” "The Japanese stole my right shoe” The shoes of Chinese were all stolen! So he had no way to go. What? Can't you laugh? Get him a pair of shoes, go! Yes sir. I didn't feel comfortable... to see him pass away with no shoes. Wear for him. That means he died till seventy four years old. White phoenix on snow-capped mountain? Wasn't he real crazy or not? Or hadn't he gone crazy at all? Only he knew it. Maybe, he didn't know it at all. A girl cries in silence... Where is the swallow heading to? Hung-siu steals snow in the frozen river. The crazy guy is... Mr. Thirteen. You can go, someone paid your bail. My mom paid the bail for you, let's go. Hey, send my regards to auntie. I'll come to listen your story tonight, you must come. It depends. Hey, are you familiar with Mr. Thirteen? Do you know him?
