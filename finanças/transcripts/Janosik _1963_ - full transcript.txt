The Slovak Film Institute presents JÁNOŠÍK Music: Editing: Sound: Starring: Cast: Koliba Film Studios, Bratislava Executive producer: Photography: Screenplay and direction: EPOCHA II Send Huncaj here, let him bring a saw! - What's Uhorcik cooking? - What else? Mutton! Sabres and axes are no use, We need barrels of gunpowder. l‘ll attack the county powder mill. Who are you making a noose for, Surovec? Who knows? Maybe my own head. I'll make a better one for you, I‘ll take your measurements! Too weak! The lords have a hook in store for me! Noosemaker... Slash out! I can cut three of you to pieces! When shooting, the important thing is the front sight. No, the target... both together. | just looked at the sight and bang! And a hussar went plonk! What a marksman lam! I saw that! Maybe the hetman will appoint me chief marksman. I can shoot a swallow in flight and a stag in the valley. I bet you shot a ram today. That's the only animal you know how to cook. Don't whine, you terror of Liptov! You've never even smelt mutton Turkish style! They say as hetman you fed your men on frogs! What... you skunk! Three men below the camp! Michalec, scout them out! Catch me! - What are you yelling for? - We‘ve got a feather bed for you! Where did you find such a team? Come and pull these altar boys, I'm getting out of breath. - Of what creed? - Polish Gorals. See that finery? Look, eagle's feathers even for a holdup. Come on, we're only chatting. They'll question you up there. Say your greetings in heaven! Ooh la la, Gajdosik's found Polish twins. They‘re tired of Polish hardship. Come to scrape a living here. So far they‘ve wept, now they'll howl. Secure it, fellows! Lift your feet, you're stepping out onto free land. This way. Older comrades to the hetman! Always the older ones! I‘m old, but they don't call me. That‘s because you're just old. Older also means wiser. Father Uhorcik, to the hetman! Make way! The hetman's calling the wise. You came here freely to set this unjust world right with the axe. Swear with us on the axe in the presence of the elders! Put your stumps here. You too! We swear before the older comrades... that we will never shed innocent blood... never divulge our outlaw secrets, even under torture... and if need be, lay down our lives for our companions. This we swear! Welcome, brothers! Welcome! Father, pour out the wine! - Let‘s approach the Lord‘s table! - Pity we don‘t swear every day. - Wait your turn! - First the newly christened. - And the hetman. - That's how it should be! I‘m coming! Goodness, who is it at this time...? Coming, coming! Good evening, Father. Reprobate... armed like this. Leave! You bring misfortune. We've no peace ever since. The lords persecute, beat, torment. That's why I'm after the count. We'll perish, we're not even allowed to hold mass. They say we stir up trouble in the church. Where‘s Count Aurel gone? What, are you going to burn? With your heart! Not fire, son! Aurel's gone to Orava. Go and burn his manor! He‘s two more! Who are you harming? Every burned-down manor or farm has to be rebuilt by the serfs! They won't build. Tell them that. During confession whisper, advise them. Make hearts burn with your heart. There no more beautiful prayer! Forgive me, Father, I know you‘re with us. Take this! Share it among the poor as needed! God forbid! I won‘t touch stolen money! It's the serfs' money! I took her in. Bailiffs tried to break into her house twice at night. Jurko, if only you knew... She should go away somewhere. Get ready, Tereza. I'll find you a safe place to live. Protect her. She suffers because of the Janosiks. Be good, son. The night has never seemed so short. Once... I was no longer little... I went with you. I dreamt l was walking on a lake with you. I‘ve never seen anything like it. Afairytale lake. We flew lightly across the water. I can't describe it. Suddenly you took my arm and said: Tereza, you‘re crying! But I wasn't crying, because it was only a dream. Now tell me what you want, or I really shall cry. But you already know. I'm lost, I'm looking for water, like a thirsty stag. Go now! Share out the cows among the serfs! The flour, too! Will do, young man! If you meet the bailiffs, send them to us! We should go back and help them. Don't worry, hetman. My men are there! We won‘t lower ourselves to go six against six. Godsbodikins. Get out of the county sheriffs way! Where can I move back to? To one side, you vermin! Be sensible, dandy, They‘re the count's beasts. How dare you call me a dandy? Don‘t beat him! Don‘t beat him in front of the county sheriff! Let him come here! We'll pass judgement. Whose are you, old man? God's, Your Grace. Ven/ well, we are all God‘s. But who do you serve? Janosik, Your Grace. ldon‘t serve as much as help Janosik! ldon‘t know him. A young hero, Your Grace! He handed me this and said: Take the count's flour to the serfs. Put it away! lwill, but I don't know how... Hands up, you gentlemen curs! Get down and undress. Come on! Off your horses, or I‘ll clean your ears out! No one has ever kissed my hand, so if you don't mind... Hurry up or I‘ll make a sieve of you! Throw down that gun! That wasn't necessary... Upon my life, what insolence! Just imagine, twenty cows! They steal twenty cows and send you a note like this! If one or two, but twenty! I could feed a regiment on that! When will they eat them all? What will they do with them? It‘s in that note, Papa. Thank you very much. We'll give them to the poor. Signed Janosik. - Have you ever heard that name? - I don't remember. Your Highness! We, our estates... we four represent authority in this county! You four without bailiffs represent nothing. Stop that, it's a question of property! It‘s wisest to offer a reward for the capture of that... Janosik. That's why I've sent for the county sheriff. The sheriff knows what to do, let him advise us! Terrible! So much property! Twenty cows! We‘ll send out messengers, call an assembly of the nobility... But not in my house! They won't eat me out of house and home! We'll go to the bishop. He can't keep a rein on his believers, so let him suffer! This is not good for your nerves. Go into the boudoir, please. Let's go and have a little rest. The county sheriff is approaching! Thank goodness! I'll go and welcome him! - The sheriff will find them. - Who? - Those cows of yours. - How? Well, you can tell a count's cow from an ordinary one! How? - Actually, a beast‘s a beast. - That's just it! - Heavens, what happened to you? - On a straight road. They stripped me like this! Chain gone, rings gone! Left me without a sou. Just like that, imagine... Outlaws! And they thrust this into my hand. - Outlaws? - The county sheriff? - And what about your constables? - Gone... Might be hanging on a tree by now. - The audacity! - Where are we living? lt's terrible just to hear. Janosik again. Clever fellow. At least he isn‘t rotting like us. That's a magpie, not a hen! Bring a bigger one! Where can I get it? You‘ve already taken ten. Don't snivel! When the lord has a wedding, he can take a pig! It‘s only an engagement! All the same! Stop griping! Eggs there. More! Greedy gluttons! Janosik is what you need! Ah, Janosik! How will he learn about us. He will. Janosik hears about everything. - Why don't you take it? - Too skinny! Kiss its arse, if its skinny! Catch this goose, you ruffian! We should make them pay for that wedding. At least eight families of counts will be there. So much grub and booze! To get to the Pongrac manor they must all pass under Strecno! There'll be at least ten bailiffs with each coach. Not strength, but tricks will decide. The devil take all the counts! Aurel has disappeared! He's sure to be there! Whoever traps Aurel can open a barrel of Tokay! That's what we like to hear! We're off! I'm going to meet Aurel. You bring the gentry to the shepherd's hut! You can count on that, hetman! Get them! Welcome, now you're all in one sack! Halt! Don't shriek, witch! - They‘re coming! - To work! - You there! What's this? - A hole, sir. We're mending it. Then get on with it, we're in a hurry! So are we! But without help, it'll be an hour or two... Jump down! Throw them those logs! Make it lively, we don‘t want to be stuck here until evening! You're standing before Hrajnoha! Put that down and get out of the way! Come on! ldon‘t understand. We're calmly on our way to a wedding... I understand. Kindly remember where Count Aurel is. In my son's coach, if you please. Somewhere behind us... there! More fires, Aurel. Halt! A horse! How much does a serf cost in your reserve? - Papa says 500 ducats, I say 1000. - I've two barrels loaded. - That‘s easy. You‘ll pay me 3000. - Usurer! - My regards to Ja’nosik! - That‘s a hero! Run home! Why... why? How these china dolls um and er, Come on, get down! Gentlemen, be sensible! Are your legs stiff? Get down from the coach! Hand over your trinkets and run off home! Be sensible, gentlemen! Get a move on, buffoon! All's in order, only we‘ve lost Aurel. No, we haven't! Come on! Come on, noble gentlemen! What you give, you give to God, you won‘t see it again! Another count with an offering! Old lady, and you fine lady, put something in for the dowry! That's the devil who stole my pearls! Don‘t shriek, old woman, you'll make yourself hoarse! Come here, we'll clean you up. Scandal, this is impertinence! I don‘t wear jewels when I travel. Undress! - No need, I'll search myself. - Then do that. You see, coy lady! Next! Come on, dandies! Trousers down! Next! Try it once without servants! If you'd deigned to die, you sure would grease the soil! - What shall we do with him? - Slit his throat and melt him down! You see! It went smoothly, just one bailiff is dead. Who killed him? Did I have to wait until he killed me? No, Gajdosik. We said we'd rob, not kill! Take the horses, burn the coaches, the gentry can go home on foot! Give the peasants what Count Pongrac prepared for these gluttons! I don't need gold and silver, not even a woman. If only there was enough wine more often. What the devil will we do with this? One of us should get married. Ifl hung all these on his bride, She wouldn't get as far as the altar. I'd know what to do with my share. I wouldn't hang it on a woman. Where‘d you find one? One look at you and she‘d have a fit. She‘d dream of the devil for a month. Better if a woman dreams of the devil than of gold! Tell them to stop that! Let them be, we‘re not in a monastery. - We're going to rot. - Rot, the hell! The rutting season's coming! It's always the same. When the stags begin to rut, men scent women. You should let them mingle with people more often. I'm going to investigate. Rajéok has reported Schwab merchants. I'll be down there all night. The night's the best time to inquire about skirts! Brats! First they cling to us and then all of a sudden... Shut up! The hetman can do what he wants and decide as he wants. That's rule in the hills! Well, shit yourself! I only blurted it out. It‘s true! He‘s got a lover! It's her he goes to see! And he'll bite the dust there! Instead of warning him... We can‘t do anything! - Gajdosik is... - Our death! I should have throttled him long ago. Lead these beasts away! Auntie, choose a cow, the count has four hundred! Flour white as snow. I've dreamt about that for years. A straw basket for each and even/ soul! - Our hetman gives all away... - The hetman can! As hetman you kept something. I don't want to be here forever. We should set something aside. Don't grouse. You swore on the axe, so shut your trap! Well, you're well off with that oath! Listen, I‘ll beat the daylights out of you here and now! Why are you scaring my children in the night?! Eh, widow, keep your hair on! Widow or not! What are you doing in my yard at night? We want to give you a cow. - One of the count's. - Just like that? That's our hetman. Robs the count to give to the poor. - And you have a lot of children. - A lot? Only seven! For seven it‘s two cows. Bring one more and a sack of flour as well! Come on, Buttercup... - And who is your hetman? - Juro Ja’nosik. Our hope, the Lord protect him! May he protect all of you, White falcons! Don‘t do that, or I might harm you! Of course, the target's the thing. Take it like this, look like this... and bang! Dammit, the powder‘s damp! Go away! You can see I'm on guard. One day you‘ll drill a hole in your belly, gaffer. Here you are, play with an axe! And who shot a hussar? Clear off, you brats! - What was that? - The gaffer shooting again. - Hasn‘t Janosik come yet? - No. It's hard to part with a lover. - The emperor's Uhlans were here yesterday. - It's true, I swear. And it's all up to me! Call the elders! Krivy says: a lot of soldiers! How many's that? A lot is twenty or two hundred! I'm not having the men butchered! Or Krivy says merchant's wagons are coming from Silesia. He doesn't know how many. Rajcok says there are eight. Accompanied by forty of the emperor‘s men. We don't know how many are going over the hills. Hetman, don't start that! The emperor's soldiers kill on the spot! Those who fear death, die even/ day. You can stay at home, we won't be dividing up gold. You needn't lose sleep on my account. But you don‘t sleep well. You‘ve slept with your belt on for some time now. Feel inside it, father! Go on, he hasn‘t got hot coals or a lizard in there! Mind you don't poke your eye out. Those are my beads! When you joined our band you were as bare as a lime tree. Pearls hatch under your belt. Father, you‘ll buy us something good for the pot with this finery. Don‘t give it to the gaffer! He‘ll buy us a ram again! If he buys a ram, he'll buy wine too. Did you hear that, gaffer? Wine. So you know what to squander those beads on. - Well, then... - Wine... - Where are you going? - Away. All right. You'll go scouting with me. - You give too many orders. - I don't like to. And you're suspicious of people. Gajdosik is a crooked fellow. But you shouldn't have degraded him in front of everyone. That won't help. If you don't trust him, let him go. I don‘t trust him and I won't let him go. Ifl do, tomorrow we‘ll all be on the gallows. Which of us do you trust in fact? You, above all, Ilcik. I wronged you most, but you didn‘t desert me. - Do you know where we are going? - We‘re following our noses. - There's an inn up there. - I know. Tereza's there. Everyone knows. They make hints when you‘re away for a long time. - Tereza helps us. - Depends who. Don't you dare, or... Hold on... You wanted to say something else. I love Tereza. I know more. She loves you. So what do you want? - I‘m worried. - She'll kill herself. It doesn‘t hurt now. I left home to get over it quicker. - It's all right now. - That's the only reason you left? Not the only. Why get in the way? You‘ve always belonged together. When they hang me, promise you'll take care of Tereza! You're mad! They'll hang us both! - Good morning, Terka! - Good morning, boys! - Hurry up and feed the wolves! - Welcome both of you! Breakfast will be ready in a minute. I don't understand it at all. Juro is a good fellow. He deserves you. Don't be angry with me. I cried many a night, prayed... nothing helped. - Good morning. - Ah, You‘re here? - Good morning, bandit landlady! - How many bailiffs are following? We didn't count them, Prepelica! Do you see them? They only come, when their lovers throw them out. SleePY. hungry, thirsty... Because you are our dearest. With you even honey is sweet! You flea-ridden... let me go! As soon as I've had a rest, I‘ll give them oats. Is that Janosik I hear? Yes, old woman. May God give you happiness. - May the Lord God hear! - You‘re up already? - I've been up a long time. - I've brought you something. You shouldn't have troubled. Something sweet to munch. - Goodness, gingerbread... - And a scarf. - How can I repay you, my dear? - Pray for me under the gallows! Don‘t blaspheme, son! - Good morning, grandmother - Ilcik! -You guessed. - Prepelica, first we‘ll eat and then sleep! We haven't had a wink of sleep all night! As usual. They come here to snore, the rapscallions! I‘m roasting a young ram! Goodness me! From now on I'll shoot rams! - I can hear horses! - Ours in the yard. Not yours. Strangers‘! We only expected them tomorrow. Don‘t start a fight here! Cheer up, bandit landlady, look merry... All ven/ well for you to say merw... They'll burn the place down. Captain Buéko and escort! We're waiting for you, Mr Buéko. I know you‘re looking for Janosik. You‘re on the right track. You'll see him today. Enough, gentlemen! Show your papers! Freeman Pulchre with his scout. Here's the seal of the county court and my weapon. Take it. Hand over your arms and go outside. Come with me. I've a county order for you. Trust deserves trust. Five hundred ducats in gold. They can be yours. You have soldiers, I know where Janosik is. But... you‘ll be risking your lives. My soldiers are afraid of no one, not even the devil. I‘d like to hear that from them. - Come closer. - What do you say to that? If you don't want a hole in your head, don‘t stick it out! IICIk, my dear, where will you lay your bones? In your yard, Prepelica, I swear! - My dear. - I'll wait for you below the road. Goodness me, blood will be shed here Martin, catch this gun! Spread out the quilt! Bow, a rich traveller's comingll And eleven servants behind him! - How much have you in your pouch? - Both master and servant are hungry! - Catch a groschen for a beggar! - Send our regards to Janosik! - Your health, comrades! - God give, hetman! Lure them into Vlckova, We'll trap them there! Will do. The straw is on the way! Keep your heads on, don‘t kill! Squadron, charge! Retreat behind the wagons! What‘s the matter, old fellow? - What happened to him? - Probably wounded. Poor thing. What‘ll we do with him? - Get them moving! - Come on, you‘re with the outlaws now! Gee up! Don't be afraid of the water, it's only up to a frog‘s belly! What's up with you? Get those hind legs moving! Get marching, damn you! Get a move on! Drive those horses! Hey, hey, bandits liven it up! And wherever I go, I leave girls in tears! Hold me tight! Come, bright eyes, you‘ve danced enough, come here! We need a counterweight, you're just right! She'll get as much as she weighs! Add some more! Turn round, girl. Then I'll kiss you!! You can show off in a shirt like that! - I'll come and show you! - Then rather at night! Help yourselves! I'm giving it all away, this turban as well! And what the devil's this? Look out, it's running over onto the ground! Never mind, the ground likes to drink too! Be generous, cloth makers! Three lengths for Anka, four for Zofka! Wool the colour of poppies! God bless you, son! Uhoréik's father... they've got him. They played beautifully. They played like that at my wedding. Hush, you‘ll do yourself harm. No, I'll be going soon. I just came to thank you, and ask for forgiveness. What's the matter, father? Nothing, son, it‘s all right now. I'll just have a little rest. Hold me tight. I'll go easier. Give me a merry send off, brothers. Sing me a song to see me on my way. My favourite, you know. What's up with you? You're sad, too? Stop, or I'll go mad. - What‘s wrong? - What‘s the matter with him? I can see a woman! - Look who's coming! - I'm flying down! - A girl like a lily! -A miracle! Where did you find such a doe? She says she's one of us, but she bit my fingers! Ooh, the little vixen! I bet she has green eyes! - I say bright blue! - Show at least one! Get on, womanizer, we can find the way without you. Lift your feet, little dove, one, the other... and now bottom up! A pretty girl. When you go back, don't pass us by! Keep your eyes down, young fellows, or you‘ll be blinded! Screw up your eyes! This is temptation from the devil! Come here, fellows! There's a woman here! - Where? What woman? - Fallen from heaven, a comely one! My eyes, don‘t deceive me! I haven't seen a woman for half a year! Take me, dear girl! I‘ll worship the ground you walk on! And you can do what you like with me! Who's are you, dear girl? Ours, Gregor. Welcome, Terka. Thank you. You needn‘t‘ve blindfolded her. She helps us. 'Twas a good thing. Women don‘t say only what they don't know. Best dumb. - She is dumb! - Only when necessary! She can talk... What have you brought us? A note. For you, Janosik, from our priest. Let go, bandit, or you‘ll pay for it! Listen to what our Father writes. The bishop has ordered me to excommunicate you, to deny you the last rites and not bury you as a Christian. That's bad. I can't die. And to spite the bishop, I won't. Come, Terka. we‘ll send him a note. See, you can forget your madonna! Girls come right to the camp to see our hetman. - That hurt! - It should have done long ago! You'll remember that! You'll remember that! As I said, you must catch them at dawn. Not even a mouse could squeeze through here. The wood is as thick as fur here. You have to go round the hill and under Gapel' into the pass. They light fires on this hill and this one. And what if... you're lying? You promised a thousand ducats, I‘m not a dog! A traitor is worse than a mad dog. - That's him? - I think he knows something. Or he‘s having us on. That one hasn't seen an outlaw even in a dream. Don't pay him anything. Janosik is in town. My bailiffs found this on the church gates. We‘ll go and pray. - What do you say? - We‘ll occupy the church. Stupid. They won't come to pray. Stand guard at the town gates! Let this cur go, and follow him. Wolves go back to the pack. A freeman from Zochova 150 ducats in silver! Count Dolinay 1000 ducats in gold. Count Cemicayi 500 ducats in silver. Count Lasicayi 300 ducats in silver! Skinflint, that Lasicayi. He drinks it all away. I've heard he even borrowed that from a Jew. Count Revay 350 ducats in gold... Count Palucky 800 in silver! - They've been looking for you. - I haven't missed anything. In an hour's time we'll have Janosik in fetters. If he's there among the monks, then even sooner. A freeman from Folkusova, 100 ducats in gold... Count Zahrayi 300 in gold... Count Bold'ayi 200 ducats... Have you seen how many nobles have come to the chapter house? - Wait, we‘ll go together! - Follow me! Janosik is in danger, we must warn him. Come this way. Praised be the Lord Jesus... Ja’nosik is in the chapter house! Surovec, no, no! Finally, we assure the glorious estates, that the money collected and blessed for the army against the outlaws will bring your souls peace and holy satisfaction. The silent brethren have brought their gift of charity. Welcome and accept our episcopal blessing. We all come into the world as equals and also leave it as such. God did not divide people into lords and beggars. This we wrote. But you still declare we break God's laws, although you know very well we do not rob for ourselves. That is why we have decided to give this collection to the poor. Rajéok saw Gajdosik in town. We've brought horses to the lower gate. Janosik‘s in town! They're catching Janosik! Stop the bandits! Seize them! Ducats! Pick them up! Don't shoot! Quick, scatter the fire! You'll lead the men through the pass to Poland. We'll meet at Smerdionka. Ilcik will stay with me and... - And me, hetman. - And you, Surovec. Go and prepare him. This hurry is pointless. Gajdosik may not have had time to betray all. Nothing‘s moving yet. The men are at their positions at the fires. What can happen to us...? Betrayal is worse than death. Today or tomorrow they'll attack, there's no avoiding it. We have nothing to reproach ourselves for or promise. I know they won't get a word out of us and we'll die like men. Hetman, we'll defend ourselves. -Yes, hetman. - Come, they've dragged him out. He broke the outlaw oath, betrayed, killed, judge him, comrades! Friends, have mercy! I didn't want to! They led me on! For God's mercy! Don't shoot! Strengthen the guard and prepare to leave. Protect us and help us, God, deliver us from all evil. Captain, I hold you responsible for his life! You can kill the rest without mercy! You can be sure they won't slip through my fingers this time. Go down quick! What is it? Got caught? - I've forgotten my pipe! - Take mine! And hurry! - What's up? - Where are the others? Clout them! There he is! That was in the horse pen. Pop down and see what‘s going on. Slow down! That‘s him! Don't shoot! After him! - Come here! There‘s a hole here! - Better not stick your nose in! Don't worry, the rats deserted their burrow ages ago. Farewell, little doves, see you in hell! Don't shoot! Don't shoot, you fool! Cut them to pieces! Shoot, comrades! Ilcik, run! Well, come on! Jesus! Ilcik! My beloved man! Who sent you here to your death? Who killed you? I'll kill! Who killed my... murderers! Who? Janosik! Tereza! -Janosik, surrender! - No! Wait! Tell me where you've hidden the stolen gold and I‘ll spare you! Only I can get a pardon for you from the emperor. Tell me, you scoundrel, or you‘ll be sorn/I I'm sorry I didn't kill you ages ago, Aurel. I haven't killed anyone, but you I should have. -You cur! - I can hear barking! If it weren‘t for my honour as a count I‘d squash you like a flea. - You‘re blabbering, Aurel. -You‘ll beg me like a little child. Go away! The honourable court is here! The honourable county court suggests, that as during the first torture the offender did not reveal the whereabouts of the stolen goods or disclose the names of his comrades, he should be subjected to severe torture. I recommend you to start with the rack. Yes. With fire! Good. With fire! Because he took to robbery along with many companions, incited people to resist authority, broke divine and worldly laws, he will be hung on a hook by the rib as a warning to others and left to suffer in agony until he perishes! This punishment will be inflicted on all those who helped or hid him, and every man or woman subject to taxes, even the foolish underage lads, who publicly approved of the deeds of the condemned Janosik, or spread reports of his banditry in any way. Almighty Lord, save the young man! God Almighty, have mercy on him! Hear him in your presence... Hear him, as you hear our prayers! Almighty God, be merciful to him! Janosik, listen for the last time! The emperor will grant you life, if you use the stolen money to arm a hundredth of an army against the rebels. Tell him, he‘s as useless as you are. Fires are burning on the hills! Tell that to your emperor. Heads up, poor and needy! Life is ours! One day even the gallows will blossom!
