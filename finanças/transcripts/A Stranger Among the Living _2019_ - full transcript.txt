Are you watching for deer? - Huh? - Well, there's a reason I sit in the backseat on car trips after dark. - And here I thought you just enjoyed my company. - Mm, some comfort you are. Your nose is all up in that romance novel. Nah, this one's got vampires. - We still haven't seen any dear. - Well, we might. - Do we ever? - Well, you know that a deer hit my family's car when we were coming back home from Christmas one year. I told you that story, right? Do you want one? It's so weird, I never even liked these things before, and now I crave 'em a lot. How is Shiloh adjusting? You know, I love the kid, but lord is she messy. - What's the deal now? - Who knows? Emma called last night. She said she needed to sort a few things out for a little while, and would I take Shiloh. - See, I told you we were almost there. Heard that one before. Are you comin'? - Sure, why not? Hey, Henry, you comin'? - All your fault! You murderer! You bloody murderer! It's not over till it comes for you! Not until you die! - Get off me! - Not until you die! - Get off me! - Geez, what is wrong with you? - There's this crazy lady! - Where? - She's right there. She was right there. - Guys, don't leave me. - Well, you know I'll take her, I mean, I love kids. James says he's scared to take me places that have babies 'cause he's scared I may steal one. - Well, at least I have a babysitter. - Guys, who's that? - You mean, you see him too? - Yeah, I think I've seen him before. Well, what's he doin' on the road? Did his car break down? - Guys? - Are we goin' in circles? - Very funny, Bobby, just get back on the normal road. - I did. - Hey, guys, I don't feel so good. - Oh my god, she's bleeding! We have to stop somewhere. Okay. - This is your fault, you know. You should have been paying better attention. - Why are we stopping here? - Because we're at the hospital, silly. - We have to go, come on. - Are you all right? - Damn ceiling is leaking into your daddy's old office again. - You need a ride to work today? - No, I didn't get any sleep last night. I'm not goin' in. - You just started this job. Are you scared of making a bad impression like the last one? - You were up late last night, I heard voices. - I was talking to Emily on Skype. - Oh. I'm glad you two are still friends. - Why wouldn't we be? - I just know it's not easy maintaining long distance friendships. I wish I could have afforded to send you to New York like her parents did. I know you'd be happier. - Not this again, Mom. - If your daddy were still alive... - But he's not. - Look, I just wanna make sure that you're gonna be okay. We both have to save every penny we've got. And I want to know I'm gonna be taken care of in my old age. - You're too young to be worried about that. - You're never too young to be worried about your future. One day, when you get married and have a house, are you gonna let me come live with you, hm? - Why don't we just cross that bridge when we get there? Honestly, I've never seen somebody in such a hurry to become elderly. - There's my bacon. - And that's my cue. I don't wanna be late. Love you, sweetie. - I love you too. - Hey, listen, do you think you could take over my cafeteria duty today? - An audition? - Yeah. - Okay, look, I would but I just got into my new doctor's office, and they squeezed me in for an appointment this afternoon. - Damn. - No, no, no, no. I am out of here before lunch, and I have a spa appointment already booked. Not happening. - Oh, come on, please, look. I'll sub for one of your classes. And I'll treat you to a spa day if I get the part. - Okay, fine. - Okay! - But you're gonna sub for my ninth grade theater class on Friday, and I want the full day. Everything included, right? - Yes, absolutely, I'll do it, thank you. - You're welcome, honey. And you can stop kissing my ask, you got your way. - Amanda, what's up, shouldn't you be in first period? - I didn't know what to do so I thought I'd just bring it to you guys. - What's the matter, sweetie? - Mitchell Mayer posted this on his Instagram last night. I think it might be some kind of a threat. But this shall be your punishment. I will take great pleasure in slaughtering you. All of you. You will finally see that I am not a mouse, but a god! - Mitchell, what is this? You know you're being accused of some very serious things. - Mitchell, you threatened people's lives. - Henry, let me handle this. Look, I remember what it's like being a kid your age. Girls thought you were weird. They wouldn't go to prom with ya, it really sucks. I didn't even lose my virginity until I was 24. It was this time where we ran down to. Okay, well, not really sure why I'm telling you this. The point is, you cannot post stuff like this. - It was just a prank. - A prank? - Why would someone make something like that up? - I don't know, Mr. Lyle. They'd have to be pretty sick, wouldn't they? - No, they'd be suspended just like you are right now. I'm calling your parents, clear out your locker. - I think we should call the police. - Ah, it's gone to voicemail. You know, I went to school with his parents. It wouldn't surprise me if they were on the couch right now baked out of their minds. - Mr. Blakely, I really think we should call the police. - Ah, don't worry about it. I don't think he'll pull any shit like that again. Now if you'll excuse me, I have another phone call to make. Apparently a parent got offended at a recent production of Anything Goes, said it was too suggestive. Sometimes I'd like to just tell them just to shove it up their ass. But I'd like to keep my job. - I don't get it, Mama. I can't make my whole life about you. You did that and look where that got you. You hate everyone, you never go out. You might as well already be dead. I'm not gonna do this anymore. Okay, you're not pulling me down with you. I won't allow it. If you wanna sit here. If you wanna sit here and waste away then go ahead, but I'm not doing it. I wanna live. I wanna meet new people and I wanna fall in love and have my heart broken. And learn new things. And become a better person for it. I'm not scared like you, Mama. I know the world is capable of beautiful things. I know there's bad things too. But if I stay here then I'll never know. I'll never know what might have happened if I had been more courageous than you and left. - Thank you, Hank. - It's Henry. - Right, we'll let you know by the end of next week. Here, I know these are expensive. - I am convinced the only way to get a part in this town is to blow someone, which I don't have a problem doing if someone would just tell me. - So what is the big deal about this place again? - It's the only theater in the state that gives you equity points so that you can go on big auditions when you get to New York or LA. - Well, it makes sense I guess. Ugh, I am so jealous of you right now. I am ready to just have this baby so I can start drinking again. - Well, I'm sure one can't hurt. Our mothers probably drank every now and then while they were pregnant. - No. No, no, no, I'm not gonna jinx this. You know, my sister Rachel, she is like a baby receptacle. I mean, she just keeps popping kids out of her body one after another, and I always think how amazing it is that two people in the same bloodline can have such different reproductive systems. I want this baby, I mean, if I didn't want this baby I wouldn't have tried for so long. Wow, did you get any sleep last night? - Well, better than the night before so I'm making progress. - Jess, do you ever have any strange dreams? - Oh yeah. Ever since I got pregnant, my dreams, I've just had doozies of 'em. Like, okay, a week ago I dreamed that I was in a three-way with Kevin Spacey and Dwight Yoakam. And then two nights ago, I dreamed that I was a sorority girl, okay, and the house mom was Cloris Leachman, and she was a meth dealer. It was too bad that that was a dream because that would make a great Netflix Original. - I had a strange dream last night. It was weird and it. I've had the odd college exam stress dream here and there. But nothing like this. You were in it. - Was I skinny? - You were pregnant. - Damn! - Mr. Blakely and Ginny, they were there. And that kid, the one that I sent to the principle's office this morning. - The creepy one? - Yeah, Mitchell Mayer. I can't, I can't remember everything, I just, I remember how it made me feel. - Are you sure I wasn't skinny? All right, speaking of that, I better call the man that did this to me. I didn't call him after my appointment, he worries. - Well, I should probably check on Ginny. See how she's handling cafeteria duty. - Oh, well, Mr. Blakely's covering it for me and, truth be known, I hope he suffers. He still owes me a favor for not telling his wife about he and Mrs. Crawley's affair. The piano teacher? - Yes. - Oh god. - I'm gonna go make my call, you just. I want you to think on that. - Okay. - Oh hey, honey, you're back. Caught me on a smoke brake. - I thought you quit. - Yeah, well, I guess I have a New Year's resolution then, don't I? - What was that? - I don't know, it sounded like fireworks. - Ginny, I think you need to go. What? - I think you need to get in your car and leave now. - He is so horrible. He worries so much and he's just so. What is it? What is it? - Shots rang out at a little after 12:30 in the lunchroom of Hamilton High just one week ago, and we're still no closer to finding out the motives behind 17-year-old Mitchell Mayer's killing spree that left four teachers and seven students dead, and over 10 injured. Even more disturbing, Mayer's parents, Angela and Michael, were found brutally stabbed to death in their Jackson home later that afternoon. The day before the shooting, the teen posted a threatening video on social media that went ignored by most students and teachers. Warning, this video may be disturbing for some viewers. - I will take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you. You will finally see that I am not a mouse, but a god. - Police were notified by two Hamilton High teachers, Henry Lyle and Jessica Newton. Neither were at the crime scene, but were said to have been on the phone with one of the victims at the time. - I feel like all of this could have been avoided if someone would have spoken up. Honestly, I just wanna take all the guns away. Just get rid of 'em all. - Oh, Henry. That's not gonna be good. - Why? - People like their guns around here. - More than their children? - I just don't think you needed to make this political, is all. - Kids died, Mom. - Already there are conspiracies that Henry and Jessica are... - Some of my coworkers died. - And that the entire thing was staged. Local politician, Natalie Jones, believe it's... - I'm sorry if I'm not giving out cotillion-approved talking points. And turned him into a murderer. - It looks like the reporters are gone. Are you okay, sweetie? I think you need to get out of this house. - Are you kidding? Most people would kill for this much down time. - I'm gonna go wash this cup out and go to bed. - I'll do it. - Look, I can do it, you... - No, you need some sleep. Just go to bed, I'll take care of it. Hey. What's up? Would you come with me to this thing tomorrow? - This thing? That sounds sinister. - It's in this kind of bad area and I don't want James to know I'm going, it's like a support group. - I don't know, Jess, that... That sounds goofy. People just sitting around talking about their feelings. You don't have to participate. I just want someone to go with me. Are you there? - What time is it? - 7:30. Goddammit. What? - Not you. Some reporter's trying to be sneaky. - Okay. - Can I call you back? - Bye. - All right. Jesus. - Can I have a quote? - Kiss my ass, end quote. - Did you remember to put the cup in the dishwasher? - Mom, go to bed. - Remember to lock it because if you don't lock it. - I know how it works. - Do you wanna come to church with me next Sunday? - Yeah, I'm sure that will really help. - There are a lot of people there your age. I don't know what I would have done without my faith these last few years I've had. - I think I'll sleep in, Mom, thanks. - Okay. - Where are you going? - To see a friend. - Do I know them? - No, I'm going to a play. - Oh, which one? Mom, I feel like I'm on Jeopardy with all the questions. I love you, sweetie. - I love you too. Be back in a bit. Hey, if you known when, hey! - I've been having really terrible dreams. Every time I shut my eyes, I think I could have done something. I think about Ginny, and how she said that her husband couldn't live without her. And I think of him at Christmas, alone. They rarely saw their daughter. They only time they ever saw her is when she dropped her kid off to go on some bender or something. So he's there with no one. And I think about the kids and their families. And I feel like I could have done something. I don't know what, but I could have done something. - Now, Jessica, you did everything you could, and you too, Henry. Now, I'm really glad you're with us today. Would you care to share something? I'm so sorry I'm late everybody. Someone OD'ed on the fourth floor of the hotel again, and so I had to wait for the police to come, and then by the time I got outta there the interstate was backed up so I had to suffer through that. And then after all that buildup it was just two people on the side of the road with a flat tire. I mean, I was really kinda hoping for a decap or two. - Jarvis! What have I told you about interrupting other people's shares? - You want some chicken? How about you, you want some? I mean, I'm not gonna eat it all, I'm on a diet. - Jarvis, you will remain silent until it's your turn, okay? - All right, now, now, go on Henry. - I'm not really comfortable sharing just yet. - So what was I interrupting? - Henry, you can share whenever you're up to it, all right? Now, would anyone else care to have a go at it, huh? What about you, Patty? I don't know what to say exactly. I didn't know I was supposed to share at this thing. - I didn't know that he was gonna ask you to share. This, it was my first time. - Jess, that's like your sixth cup of coffee since you've been here. - I didn't sleep good last night. - It doesn't look like you're gonna sleep well tonight. What? What? What are you staring at? - It's nothing. It's probably just I haven't gotten enough sleep. Have you seen strange things since that day? - Define strange? - Well, you know like you're being watched or maybe followed? - Reporters? - No, no, no. It's not them. It's like when I'm walking in a parking lot there's someone walking like right behind me. And then when I go outside in the morning to get the paper, they're watching me. They're always staring at me. I knew, I knew you would think I was crazy. - No, hey, I don't think you're crazy at all. Maybe you just need some sleep. - Yeah. - Maybe a vacation. - A vacation wouldn't do any good because then I would have to come back here. Because you can't outrun your demons. And I have a feeling the worst part of it hasn't even started. - You gonna be okay? All right, you call me if you need me. - Hi. I'm Jarvis Coker. - Oh yeah, I noticed. - Look, I'm sorry about sabotaging your share back there, but I tend to do that, I've gotta stop doing that. You know, it's not all about you, Jarvis. - Hey, don't worry about it. I really didn't have anything to share anyway. - Oh thank god, a normal one. I swear, it's like most of the people here are absolute looney tunes. Oh not you, no, no. Not you, no, you're great, you're great. She's the worst one, she's horrible. I feel like I've seen you before. - From the news? - Oh hell no, I don't watch the news. Way too depressing. I think we should try to keep things light, don't you? - Yeah. - You audition at Center Stage right? - Yeah, all the good it does me. - Oh my god, right? It's like the whole thing's rigged. I's like, look, the sets look great, the costumes are great, but they cast the exact same people in everything. - They told me you had a vision. They said that you knew what could happen. That you saw it before it happened. And you didn't tell anybody! You killed those kids! You should have reported that boy. My granddaughter had two bullets in her head because of you! It's all your fault. I would kill you right now for what you did to those kids! But you are not worth it. Justice will be paid eventually. Oh, there are many forms of justice in this world. - Whoa. Oh my god. Are you okay? - Yeah. - Wow. I can't believe I almost died in a church parking lot that's right down the street from a City Trends. Do you want a drink? They all talk the same, you know, they all have that same weird way of talking. "Oh, I am so happy to audition for you." "I am so grateful for this opportunity." And they all sing, like they all sing like this, like way up here. And all the guys have that weird like rock nasal tenor crap where they're all like this. It's like ugh, just makes we want to claw my ears out and just throw them at them. Waiter! Hi, can I have more? Thanks. Ridiculous. - Well, I wish I could sing, even a little bit. My dad could so. - Could? - Yeah. - What, is he dead? - Alzheimer's, early onset. - Ooh, I'm sorry. - Yeah, that's okay, I get that a lot. He was in a band in the '80s. He was good too, they even put out a record. But then he got married, had a kid, a normal job. All that crap. He used to tell me he wanted to be a music teacher, but it just didn't pay enough, not for my mom at least. She had an image and a lifestyle to uphold, but I think that if my dad had had a reason to live he might would have, he might would still be here. He might would have gotten sick still, but he would have had a reason to fight. - So you and your mom weren't worth fighting for? - Is that enough? You know, for an artist. At least, if you're not able to do your art, you might as well be dead. Ugh. - But you, I mean, you've gotten out, done things. I've just mostly done bad community theater. - I mean, after I was kicked out of college, I went straight to New York. I did a few Off-Off-Off-Off-Off-Broadway shows, and then I landed the highly coveted gig of SpongeBob Number Three at the Nickelodeon Theme Park Hotel. - I didn't know they had a hotel. They don't, they don't, it closed. Waiter! - You know, I feel like I am wasting my time. I'm never gonna get outta here. And I'm just gonna end up like these other mindless zombies who just go through the motions. - Well, I have ways of finding out, you know. - Are you psychic? - Okay. I learned how to read palms. It's a long story. I was living out of a van when I was 23 with this guy. He was addicted to crystal meth. He still had all of his teeth though, which was a nice touch. - I don't really believe in all of that. - Okay, so you're the one with the visions, and you don't believe in this? Okay, give me your hand. Let me prove myself. Hey, that eye roll was completely uncalled for. Let's see here. Ooh, okay. - What? What do you see? What? What, am I not gonna get married? Have two and a half kids? What? Am I dying tomorrow? - According to this... You should already be dead. - Look, I gotta go. - I didn't mean to scare you. - It's fine, it's good to meet you, but I really do have to go. Can I help you? Excuse me, I. Excuse me, I need to get in. - I know you're an actor and everything, but are you prone to dramatic exits? Here, you left this. You know, if I wasn't such a decent person I would've kept it for myself, but then I got to thinking how me might end up in the same meeting at some point, you might see me wearing it, and that'd just be tacky. About, you know. I didn't mean to scare you. It's a party trick, nothing more. - It's fine. - Look, I know how hard it is to admit that there's a issue, but you've taken that first step, and that takes a lotta guts. - Okay, look, I'm really fine. I don't have a problem. Okay, I was just there for Jessica, that's it. - Okay, okay, if you say so but just know that if you ever need to talk to anyone I'm open day or night, but if you could keep it between the hours of noon and 6 p.m. that would be great. I programmed my number into your phone under BFF while you were in the bathroom. You should really like lock your phone. There's so many crazies out there. So where you parked, where you parked? - I'm over there. - Oh, me too, I'll walk you to your car. - Ma? What are you doing? - Were you gonna tell me about this? - Why were you going through my things? - Have you been selling drugs? - I was doing this so I could... Move away. And have a year or two taken care of. - With everything that's happened here? My car, the leak in the attic, the... - Well, maybe if you didn't keep buying bullshit like new chairs and curtains for our non-existent guests this wouldn't be an issue. - Henry, there's nothing wrong with me wanting this house to look nice. I may end up selling one of these days. - It's my money, okay? I will take care of the loans when I can. - I guess you just want this to keep earning interest while you dally off to New York and get your dreams quashed. - Hey, well the sooner I head out there, the sooner I can come back with my tale between my legs and take care of you in your twilight years. I mean, that's all you care about, isn't it? It's all about who's gonna take care of you? Because you can't stand the thought of being alone. I will take care of you when the times comes, but it hasn't, and before it does I have to live my life. You're not even that old. Why are you making this seem like such a bad thing? - Because, Henry, it is a bad thing. You think I haven't seen how this world treats the elderly? Henry, I'm scared. I'm not gonna end up a vegetable in one of those nursing homes like that one where your Maw Maw is. Like the one they sent your daddy to. I need to know that I'm gonna be taken care of in my old age. And I think... I think it's the least goddamn thing I deserve after taking care of raising you. - Was I that much of a burden? - No. Oh Henry, that's not what I meant. - It's never what you mean. Dad believed in me. - I believe in you. No, you don't. - I just wanna know that you're gonna be safe. It's a tough business, Henry. - You don't think I know that? You don't think I think about that every day of my life? God, if I could do anything else I would, but this is it. - I think your daddy would have wanted you to stay here and pay off those student loans. - Sometimes you just have to take a risk. I mean, Dad could have stayed in the band. He could have been a star. - Henry. No. No, he was never gonna be a star. He wasn't that good. Neither are you. - Oh. There it is. - No. Oh, Henry! Henry! Oh my god. Oh! - I just came for my friend who didn't tell me she wasn't going to be here. She's been taking everything really hard since the, well, you know. I think she worries about me because I haven't really felt much since the shooting. I don't cry or talk about it much. - Now, there's nothing wrong with crying. - I've always had a bit of a nervous disposition. Still I venture to say that I am probably the sanest, most sensible person that I know. I never did drugs or got drunk every night or had sex. I just never really had much interest in all of it, to be honest. I mean, all of my classmates did, but I didn't. The point is that I'm weird, but I'm not crazy. And Jessica, she doesn't strike me as the crazy type either. But... But there's been this something in the air since the shooting. I've tried to shrug it off, but it just follows me everywhere that I go. I used to have this dream when I was a kid. And even well into my 20s where... Where I'd killed someone. For good reason, it was self-defense or something. And I buried the body, and I got away with it. But then, years later, the ground was dug up and the body was found. And I'm terrified that I'm gonna get caught. Then I wake up and 10 minutes after I would feel like someone was out to get me for what I did. That's how I feel now, like someone or something is out to get me. Hi, this is Jessica. Sorry I can't come to the phone right now. Leave me a message and I'll call you back. - You know, you don't have to call me, I'm right here. - Yeah. I didn't call. - Yeah, I mean, I'm not gonna lie. My feelings were a little hurt for a bit, but I know you wanna be my best friend and make it up to me so what are you doing tonight? - Well, I was actually just calling to check on Jessica because I haven't seen or heard from her in a few days. - Okay, well you can do that and everything, but how do you feel about maybe coming over to my place and having something to eat? It's my birthday, my fiance's cooking, he's really good. Oh, come on, unbutton your top button. You know, throw your shoes off. Paint the town red, whatever that means. - Okay, look, I haven't eaten so I can come over for a little bit. - Okay, perfect, perfect, I will text you the address. - Hello. Are you selling something? - So you just punched the kid in his face. - Right in his face, right in his fat little face. I had had it up to here, I mean, it was so hot that day, and I was like full SpongeBob regalia so it was like super, super hot. And this kid keeps putting this stick in my face so I just shove it. And it was so satisfying, and then I got fired the next day. But it was totally worth it, absolutely worth it. - Oh, Wells, let me help you. You cooked, it's the least I could do. - No, no, really it's fine, I got it. - Look, never volunteer to help him. He's got his own dish washing system. You're never gonna get it right. - Are you done? - Well, I'm fat, Wells, so that's all I'm gonna eat. - You're not fat. - I know I'm not like 1000 pounds, but there are different kinds of fat, Wells. - Well, then you're an imaginary fat. - Oh, that's sweet, that's so sweet. That would very sweet if I wasn't convinced you're trying to keep me fat so that no one else will want me, it's so sweet. He wants me all to himself. Hey, sweetie? You mind if I take a few of these to the guys at the morgue? We have so much left over. I figure I might take some in, you know, cheer 'em up a bit. - Sure. I mean, you do all the cooking so I'm not gonna need 'em. - So, what happened? Well, actually do you wanna tell 'em? I'm scared I might be late. - Sure, sure. Well, you see, a few weeks ago or. How long ago was it again, babe? Three weeks. - Okay, so three weeks ago his friends at the morgue started to notice the bodies were just disappearing. Believe it or not, stuff like that has happened before. Like college pranks and stuff. - I can't believe people still do that. - I know, it's totally gross, right? But this was different 'cause they would take the bodies, but then they would bring them back. - I had a guy tell me just the other day one came in. A nun. - A nun? - Yeah, she was still in her habit and everything. Died from some freak aneurysm or something. - So where did they find the body? - It was somewhere downtown in a parking garage. - Are you all right? - No, sorry, I was just thinking about something. - Well, anyway, the guys in security have been in a pretty bad mood ever since this started. Probably scared they're gonna get fired. Because, see, the thing is we watch the security tapes. And we can't find anything fishy. I mean, the camera might malfunction every once in a while and cut off, but that's it. Well, that would be something fishy, Wells. - All right, well what I mean is, smart-ass, is that we can't se any vandals or anything, that's weird. It just goes to show whoever's doing this knows what they're doing. - Yes? - Henry, you have to help me. I've done something and, oh god. You have to help me. He wasn't himself, please, he... - Jess, what's wrong? - You have to get here before. I don't know what I've just done, I. Oh god! - What? What is goin' on? - Listen, I've done something really crazy, but you have to understand that I did it in self-defense. - What did you do? - No, no, no, Henry. - Don't touch me! - Look, I know this is crazy, but it wasn't James. - What have you done? - He left to go get cigarettes, and then when he came back he, he, oh god... - Jesus. - I don't know who that is, but it's not James. It's not James. It was his eyes, his eyes, they, they... They didn't look normal. Okay, it was really weird. He looked just like those people that I've been seeing. - What people? - Henry, Henry, you know, you know, the people. You know, the people because you've been seeing them too. And they've been following you. - Jessica, we need to call the police. - What are the police gonna do? What are they gonna do? They're gonna get them too. They're gonna get anyone that stands in their way. - Jessica. - Please, please. Please, you have to listen to me, okay? We just have to get out of here right now! I have to get my jacket. Henry! James's body isn't there! - What do you mean, he's not there? - I mean his body isn't there, we have to leave! Oh my god! - James. James, stop! I don't wanna do this! Yes. My name is Henry Lyle. I'm at 1845 Hill Street. I need to report a murder. It's not my house, it's a friend's. She stabbed her husband to death. And then he snapped her neck. Yeah. Mom. Mom. We have to go. Mom. I'm coming, I'm coming. Shut the door! - What, Christ, what's going on? - Where's Wells? - At work, duh. - Lock it! - What's? What's going on? - Hello? - Wells, can you come home? - Come home why? - Henry, just came to the house, and he's drenched in blood and mumbling something about his friend Jessica and her husband. I think there might have been some kind of a fight. I really don't know, but I'm kinda freaking out right now. And he just says that he really wants you here so if you can just get in the car, please. - You and your damn strays from group. If this one attempts suicide like the last one. - Wells, just get in the car and come back home! Please, do this for me. Fine, just hide the pills and knives until I get there. - Thank you, sweetie. I love you. These should fit. The bathroom's right across the hall. Do you need something, like a Xanax or something? - That's her. That's the lady that attacked me tonight. - Is that the woman from the parking lot? - Yeah. - Well, Henry, it says that she's dead. - No, that's her, I saw her. - Henry, that sounds insane. - I know it sounds crazy. Earlier tonight, I would have been right there with you. And Jessica, she tried to warn me. But it didn't make any sense! The dream. The dream, it was a warning. I don't know why it came to me, but it did. I know what's happening now. I wasn't supposed to survive that massacre. I was supposed to be there. We were supposed to be there! We weren't supposed to be saved. - Henry. - I know it sounds crazy! Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe I'm outta my mind. I have to prepare myself that I might just be out of my mind! That's the most rational explanation, isn't it? But what if I'm not? What if I'm not crazy? - I called Wells, he's on his way. I'm gonna... I'm gonna go wait for him. Wells, what are you doing? - Is Wells here yet? Jarvis. Shit! - Are you all right? - Whoa! - Don't touch me! - Do I need to call the police? - No, please. It doesn't matter! They're gonna find me anywhere I go! I need some gas. Please. - Did you try using a card, sir? - I don't have my wallet! Something's after me! Please, please, I just need some gas. I have to get outta here! - Sir, I'm not allowed to let people get gas without paying. - Please. I'll give you anything you want just. An IOU, I'll give you my address. I'll pay you back, I swear, just please. - Okay.
