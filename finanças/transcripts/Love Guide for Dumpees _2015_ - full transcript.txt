Well, it could easily lead to acute heart failure. Or even cardiac arrest. She'll be fine. Don't worry. But why'd you fight? We didn't. Then why did she...? I have no idea why, either! Sounds like a cow being slaughtered. what did you have for dinner? She's bringing up a lot of food. Sex something... That cocktail... Sex on the beach! It's that color. Luckily, the drugs kicked in slower because of the food. So she’s all fine? She almost died, pal! Let's see. Her IV is almost done. Insurance won't cover an attempted suicide... so i'll write gastrospasm A considerate doctor, huh? i'll prescribe pills for 3 days. Start her off on porridge. When she wakes up, she can go. Okay.

If I died at your house, he'd know right away. You're crazy. Why drag me into it? When i passed out, did I look pretty? What? I wanted to die looking pretty. I don't know. Who’d remember that then? Even if I do, I'll erase that memory! Aren't you sorry to me at all? You wreaked havoc in my place. You're not over Ju yeon either! Too bad. That boat has sailed. She's on her honeymoon with him. We both lost at love. So what if we slept together? Don't talk like we're friends. We were intimate in bed, but this is different. Watch what you say! Is that important now? Forget it.

Who was it that night? My newlywed neighbors keep me up. Don't agonize me. Don’t you trust me? If you told me, I would've left quietly. Damn wind. Quietly, my ass. Then who peeped when Ju-yeon and I did it? i walked in on it, but left quietly. No, you quietly hid. And watched till the end, then flew off Yes! 1 point left. That feels good! Sick bastard. Who was it that night? I heard some moaning and groaning. Such a bad ethics teacher. A big mouth with a small dick. Sex is not about size. It's about angling and duration. Go round. Right, right, right! Left, left, left! You know, man? Says the small dick. Way to go. Forget women with women. Think about it, Jeong-hoon. You didn't first meet Ju-yeon on a sworn oath. No! You saw her and got horny. So you did it and it was good. So you did it again and wondered if it's love. Then you did it again. You did it here and there. And everywhere! Then you think it must be love. Are you rapping? Something's up with you. Spill it Tell me, man! Forget it. Aren’t you going to class? He did it. He did. He definitely did it. You did it. Raise your leg slowly and hold it. Let your energy flow down from head to... It's Kim from the Marriage Bureau. Your mother has already paid in full. So I can't get a refund? That's absurd.

The teacher exams are coming up. This dinner is to encourage our short term male teachers. Thank you! The school's breasts... I mean, benefits... are the best. Historically... Matriarchal societies were far more peaceful. If women go on sex strikes, all wars will cease to exist. Men don't know how great women are. That's the downside of the ramming method. Cramming method.

How about making real food for people? Catering for Jun-seok's hospital opening. It pays $5,000 for 15 people. It shouldn’t be hard. Why me? You know lots of chefs. Well...

So how can I love anyone? Being alone suits me. Let's just drop it. Stop. Aren't you sorry to yourself? You told me to live life! You told me to be happy! Fuck! I hate being me! I can't stand it! Fuck! Fine. If you hate yourself... I do too. I'm a loser for coming here. Mr. Yoo must be heartbroken. I've never seen him drunk. He says he isn't. Says it's too big and deep to understand. Don't mind him. No matter whom you date later... You must pass on the techniques you learned from me. But... After breaking up with me, you must date a younger woman. Why? So she can learn from you. And when she's my age, she can teach younger men. Isn't that great? Tre bien! You'll really break up with me? Marriage is not for me. A coffin is made for one. But Ms. Kim? How about a coffin for 2? Or get cremated and buried under the same tree? Be together forever. Can you handle a gal like me? Of course I can. I love you. Truly. Mom? The kimchi soup you made when I got sick... Yes? How do you make it? I can't remember. Why all of a sudden? You didn't even eat it much. It won't taste the same if I don't make it for you. Are you hurt? Yes. Where? Does it hurt a lot? It hurts. Pull yourself together. Don't you have a man to buy you some medicine? Living differently is nothing much Look at me. Happiness is just living a normal life like everyone else. Okay. We can't have everything we want. Cater to others and give up a little like everyone else. No! No! No! I can't believe it! Espresso must be... At once. It's okay. You didn't know. Come here! Waiter! One more, please. You don't trade stocks? It's too difficult. Stocks aren't that hard Buy when they're low and sell when they’re hot. What kind of car do you like? Coupes? Sedans? Convertibles? Sports cars? I did my MBA at Harvard. I'm a frontrunner to lead the future of Korea's economy. I have many offers from... Two 3-star ratings out of 5. Five 4-stars and you got 3 call backs. Why quit now? Don't think too hard. Why not meet a well-rated man and live comfortably? Do you think ratings feed you? Yes. They do. Don't you know by now? I'm no doctor like Jun-seok. Because i have no money or ego So i got dumped again. Love? Do you love me? Weren't we just sex partners? You son of a bitch! How can you do that to me! You bastard! screw you, shithead! You... Stupid... Bastard. Let’s see. Your liver is okay. But I think you have depression. And a lot of stress. I'll give you an IV for your hangover. Next time, go to a psychiatrist, not here to the ER. Doctor? I can see a psychiatrist... But we've talked before. It's because of her. At first, I was curious. Her collarbone got me. She was a little strange then. Kept asking to go to my place. We had drinks together. Then... We did it. We slept together that night. It was unbelievable. So we decided to be sex partners. Console each other to get over our ex lovers. When we ended things... I felt incredibly empty inside. And the coupon is all filled up! Doctor? Can sexual attraction be love? Sexual attraction? Did we have sex because we're in love? Or did we fall in love because of sex? why is it so complicated? Who cares if the chicken or the egg came first? Just eat the chicken and the egg. If your body moved your heart... Let your heart move your body and go. There are two types of people in the world. Those who know the taste of raw skate and those who don't Those who don't know don't know love either. But my baby eats it well. She knows how to love! She's so lovely. Great. MA JU-YEON How's the baby? Its fine. Drunk driving was his hobby. I warned him so many times. He was really something. He just left behind a cell phone Filled with women's numbers. I hate him. i'm sad I feel sorry for him. Why! What's wrong? Daddy! I want to play! Ju-yeon is in labor. What? Really? Anyway did she come? Who? Jeong Si-hu. Honey? How's this place? I'm hanging up. What's he talking about? Si hu. I ate the whole cake. What? I ate the cake that night. And... I could die. Wait! I mean... Hold on. Stay right there. What are you doing? Seriously, I could die. Like Jun-seok, no one knows when he or she will die. That’s life. So I'm... I'm seizing today. The last step. there! I did it! Everything's cleared up now! Stop. Your face will explode. Okay. I wasn't being honest. I just acted cool. Why're you doing this now? Because I can't run away. I'm a loser who always ran away. But I cant run away from you. I like everything about you. I can't forget you. There is no way.. I can run from you. We may have started off in a weird way... And so I'm a bit late. But I .. I love you. 5 seconds left! Focus till the end! Pass the ball! Pass it! Way to go, Jeong-hoon! With 7 billion people on earth there must be 7 billion ways to love. Like love at first sight it was love at first sex for us. Finished? Yes. Here I come. Merry Christmas. No. Merry Clitoris-mas. Merry Clitoris-mas. At first you wonder if its right if there's an answer, it's not love. We could break up tomorrow. But we could also die before tomorrow comes. Seize today. Not yesterday or tomorrow but today. ONE-NIGHT SALMON MEAL Good! Delicious, right? if you're not happy now, it'll be the same anywhere else. Being with you now I'm happy. The one by my side now... I love you.
