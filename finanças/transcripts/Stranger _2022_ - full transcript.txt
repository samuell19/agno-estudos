But I'm glad that we get to do this together first. - Mm? - Mm-hmm. Me too. Wait, should we break in every room as we go? - Ooh, is that a challenge? - Maybe. Maybe after you make a proper cocktail, we can discuss. Wait, wait, are you extorting me for my cocktail making abilities? That's kinda the only reason we're together. Is it? Mm. I love it up here. Yeah, me too. Isn't there another bedroom downstairs? Yeah, there's a few. - Let's check 'em out. - All right. Didn't realize this place had so many bedrooms. Yeah, it's not bad.

Again, I'm sorry. I'll just pile this wood up and I'll be on my way. It's okay, you just caught me off guard is all. Well, that was not my intention. I saw your car drive down the road, so I assumed that you guys would both be out and that this would be a good time to drop the wood off. Yeah, no, that makes perfect sense. Sorry for my reaction. Are you okay there? Oh, uh, yes, yeah. I just, I cut myself cooking dinner. Well, be careful there. There's a lotta things out here that wanna kill you. What? No, I just mean that, you know, you should get that cleaned up. It's easy to get an infection. You got a first aid kit in there with you? I'm not sure. Well, you know, I could run home and grab some stuff for you and come back if you like. No, no, no need, um, I'm sure we have stuff around here. I just haven't had a chance to look yet. Uh, there's no need for you to come back, we're good. Okay. Well, that should do you then, Mm-hmm. Should be plenty for the next few days. But, you know, if you guys run out or you need anything, you know, don't hesitate to call or, you know, just come on by my place, just, just down the road. Mm-hmm, yeah, thank you, it's very kind of you. All right, no trouble at all. - Okay. Thanks, again. - Yeah, I'll see you around. Bye. Back to your favorite local radio station. This is still Quote Robinson here with my fellow community citizens. It's Friday night. As in the rest of the country, we are officially in summer. As a matter of fact, it's been a hot summer already, and it looks like we're going to have a very long summer this year. Let's keep updating you on the unusual tropical situation, which is predicted to reach the peak next weekend. Tomorrow, Sunday, and Monday, we're going to track the skies given the monsoon moisture from the south. Some areas may- Of 71 and a maximum of 79 with sky conditions that were almost clear and silent. We're warning you though, the temperature will drop to a minimum of 65 and a maximum of 72 on Tuesday and Wednesday, where the chances of rain will have a peak with an average 65% of rain. We will then bounce back to- Who is it? Who is it? It's me, who do you think it is? Sorry, I just, I got freaked out a minute ago. Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, why do you have a knife? 'Cause that creepy groundskeeper came by. Dammit, he came off to drop off the wood, didn't he? - Yeah. And you didn't think to mention to your fiance, who was here all alone, that he might be stopping by, so. I'm sorry, I forgot. All right? - Yeah, and- - I'm sorry you got scared. Did you know this place doesn't have a TV? Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I realized that when I got here, but, uh, you have your laptop, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. I'm sorry, I just got really scared. I mean, he like came by the kitchen window when I was at the sink and just like came out of nowhere. Came by the kitchen sink., why didn't he, why didn't he go to the front door? He, he thought that we had left together when you went to go get pasta so he didn't know I was here. Hey, hey, what's this? Oh, nothing, I just cut myself when I was cook- Nothing, let me see. It's not that bad. - Baby! - It's not that bad. Not that bad? You almost cut your finger off. You're ridiculous. Did you clean it? I just ran water over it. All right, look, I'm gonna get some stuff and I'm gonna clean it up for you, all right? Or at least pour some whiskey over it. You could take the boy out of the south. Hey, I heard that. Okay. All right. Oh, come on, it's not gonna hurt, all right? Plus, we know what the whiskey's really for, right? Okay, fine, let's just get it over with. Okay, one second. Wait, should we trust that? Is it expired? Do I even care? - It's fine. It's fine. All right, just a little bit to make sure you don't get an infection. You ready? - Yeah. Oh, you're okay. Uh-uh. All good. All right. Now just a quick bandaid, you'll be good. Okay. All right, good as new. Although, I don't know if you should be drinking alcohol, you know, it's a blood thinner, I should probably finish this for you. Well, in that case, Doctor Taylor can go fuck himself. - Wow, whoa. - Mm. Little harsh. You know this house is expecting sex - Mm. - And we wouldn't wanna disappoint the house now, would we? Patience, Doctor. Okay. Okay, so, - Yeah. We have about nine minutes before the pasta's ready. Um, so in the meantime we could... So, what could we do in nine minutes? Is that what you're asking? Huh? - You're such a perv. Oh, come on, you should appreciate my completely appropriate level of perviness. - Hey. - That's where we're at. Mm. For you, yes. - Huh, you like it. - Hmm. Shut up, John. Or you could shut me up. Let's see if you can make it nine minutes. So, still got about six minutes before the pasta's done. - No way. - Yeah. Oh my gosh, shit. Shut up. Is that the car? Stay here. I'm sure it's nothing. Oh, I'm not going anywhere. The car's fine. I'm sure it was just a squirrel. Nothing to worry about. Okay, I'm gonna go drain the pasta so it doesn't get sticky. Come on. John, dinner's ready. I'll be right up. What are you doing down there? Baby? Yeah? What's up? Nothing, there's a pipe leaking. I'll notify the owner in the morning. Okay, well, come up and eat because the pasta's getting cold. Gotta watch a movie. - Yeah, I'll be right up. - Okay. So what kinda wine did you get? Pinot Noir, of course. Come on, it's your favorite. - Yes. - All right, you ready? Um, am I gonna hate it? Probably, yeah. - Okay. - All right. - I already hate it. - Oh, come on. Give it a chance. I will, I will, I'm sorry. Next time I pick a movie. Hey, these old school horror movies are classic. Do you remember one time when we were small, we were out here? It was from right over there. I jumped out at you from behind the tree and grandpa got all excited and he shook his fist at me and he said, "Boy, you'll be damned to hell." Remember that? Right over there. Well, you used to really be scared here. Johnny. Oh, you're still afraid. Stop it now, I mean it. They're coming to get you, Barbara. Stop it! You're ignorant. They're coming for you, Barbara. Stop it, you're acting like a child. - What an asshole. - They're coming for you. Look, there comes one of them now. - He'll hear you! - I hope this movie gets better. - It will. - I'm getting out of here. - Johnny! I'm relatively sure it does. - Help! - Boom! - Jesus. - Johnny, help me! John, what's that noise? It must be the pipe. Fuck, that's ridiculous. Well, look, the pipes are right below us, right, you're gonna hear it. Are you sure? Yes. Calm down. Calm down, you calm down. Fuck. Remind me why we do this to ourselves. Hey, I think you're still just a little creeped out from the grounds keeper guy today. Yeah, probably. Finally a reasonable choice from this chick. Yeah, see, she ain't that useless. We'll see. Yeah, but if this was 1968, you'd be cuddles up to me, clenching my arm right now. - Oh, yeah? - Oh, yeah. And then you would have your hand on my knee. Oh, yeah? Slowly work it up like that. And then what? And then you'd give me a foot rub. What? A foot rub, is that what I would do? Yeah, what were you thinking? I was thinking about something else. John! Okay, here we go. I knew it was coming, but now it's on. Oh, it's been on for a minute. It's nice to get out of LA, huh? So nice. It's crazy how you can see the stars out here. - Yeah. - Mm. The town is so cute too. Mm-hmm. But it's so crazy how like the stores are only open like a couple days a week at really weird times. Yeah, it's a family town. Get a lot of people come up here and raise families. Raise kids. Huh? Yeah. Hey, remember we gotta get the stuff out of the car. Uh, yeah, we should do that. Okay. - Want some first? - Mm. - Okay. - Okay. I'm gonna brush my teeth really quick. Okay, I'm gonna change first. Okay. Ah. No. One, two. Ah. Mm, mm-mm. Move over. - So? - Maybe. Ah, I'll take a maybe. Okay, I know you will. Hey, what time is it? - It's like 11:30. - Mm. You better put that lid down before you flush that toilet. Don't I always? You know how many germs fly up when you flush a toilet? Like a million. I mean, yeah, it's gross. Like, what do you wanna do, brush your teeth with a poop toothbrush? I don't think so. Oh my gosh, is this like some, uh, some fetish thing we should talk about? - Just- - Okay, okay, look, I'll flush the toilet now and forever. Thank you. Do you wanna go on a hike in the morning? Do I look like I wanna go on a hike in the morning? Well, not yet. Mm, and you guessed right. You either get sex or a hike? - Pick one. - Ah. Which one do you think I'm gonna choose? I know which one. Okay. Mm. Mm. - Good morning. - Mm. Wake up, Johnny Boy. Wake up. - Mm. - Want me to make you some coffee? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah, that'd be great. - Okay. Mm. Oh, or you can come back in bed. Smells great. I'll join you in a minute. John, did you leave this door unlocked last night? Ah, shit, um, yeah, I might've. Are you fucking kidding me? After that creepy guy scared the shit out of us, you're gonna leave this door unlocked? Like, I just came out to have a smoke. Okay, we're fine, it's not that big a deal. I get it. Ugh, unbelievable. Why, thank you. Oh, wasn't a compliment. Um. Thank you. - Yep. How about I make us some breakfast? You hungry? Yes, please. Do you want one egg or two? Uh, two. Aw. Wow, so cute. What? Come look at this. They're available for fostering. Just saying. Well, I'm just saying that'll be really nice for whoever fosters them, anybody but us. But, hey, since we're on the subject, I could do a baby instead. We haven't even started planning our wedding yet. Right, have you set a date for that? Okay, we're not about to have this conversation right now on our vacation, so. Right. I'll just go back to making breakfast. Mm, delicious, baby, thank you. You're welcome. Hey, so I know you said you didn't want to earlier, but it's nice outside, - Mm. I would love to go for a hike or a walk around the neighborhood. And? And you're invited if you'd like to join. Um. I don't know, I, uh- - Don't worry about it. I'm probably just gonna go after breakfast. No, yeah, I just, I love that for you, baby, I just don't really feel like it, so. No pressure. But I think I'm gonna go and take my mat out, do some yoga on the deck. That's great. I won't try to convince you. Thank you. Couldn't even make it through breakfast. No, I just have to send a quick email, I forgot. I'm just messing with you. What? Are you mad? No, no. I better go get ready though. Okay. Okay. All done. Should be good for the rest of the day. That's great. You gonna be like this all day? I'm not being like anything. I just wanna get outside, go for a hike, get out in some nature. Why did you move my toothbrush? I didn't. John, it's okay, if you knocked it over or something, just tell me. Rebecca, I didn't touch your toothbrush. I only do when it's to put it on the charger. John, I know what I did with my toothbrush last night. I finished brushing my teeth and I put it right there next to the soap. Well, um, yeah, I don't know what to tell you. Well, I know I didn't move it so, had to have been you, but whatever. Bullshit. What? What the fuck? John? Dammit! Who is it? Oh, just a neighbor. I said, who is it? Oh, I just live down the street. How did you get into the gate? Oh, I'm an old friend of the owner. He gave me an extra remote in case for emergencies. Jesus. - Hi. - Hi, how can I help you? I sincerely apologize for disturbing you, but my little Piglet got out last night. Your cat's name is Piglet? Yes, ma'am. Okay, well, I haven't seen him. That's strange, I, I swear I saw him come this way. And this is the only house that... You know, it's okay, ma'am, if you could just do me a favor? If you happen to see him running around, do you mind just calling that number on the back of the picture? Uh, we just live a ways down the road and, well, there aren't that many neighbors. Are you sure he is not in here? I know what I saw. And if you could just let me come in and take a quick look. - No, it's okay, I have your number, right, so I'll just give you a call. I'd rather you not come in the house, so. Are you hiding my Piglet? - What? - Are you hiding my baby? - No! - I know he's in here. Okay, I know what I saw. Please just let me come in, just for a second, please. - Okay, you're crazy. - Let me in! - What the? Let me in. Geez. Fuck it. Still got it. Whoo! - Hi, baby. - Hi. Did you get a little sleepy out here? Mm-hmm, yeah. And I feel like I was dreaming about you 'cause now here you are. Here I am. Got back as soon as I could. Aw, thanks, baby. - Yeah. - I love you. I love you too. I'm gonna go shower real quick, I'm all sweaty. Yeah, I know, I got sweaty too. Shower sounds nice. But I like it when you're sweaty. Aw, gross. Why don't you go start the shower and I'll be up to give you a surprise? - Okay. - Okay. Mm. Ooh, why, hello there. Mm. Mm. I miss you. I'm right here.

Yes, beyond that. Mm, I don't know, what were you thinking about? I don't know, I mean, we can go into town. We can go to the lake. - Mm-hmm. Both sound fun. Um, honestly, nothing sounds better than just lounging in our underwear all day. All right, can't argue with that one. Okay. Of course, she got her UGGs. Hey, hey, come on, you know I can't go anywhere without them. I've been wearing these UGGs since you met me, boy. - I know. - Better know. No way. Yes, ma'am. The absolutely perfect martini. Hey, this martini is a special $20 martini with blue cheese stuffed olives. Yeah. - Wow, that's a pretty high price tag to live up to, baby.

No, I'm being serious. Baby, you know I can't leave LA 'cause of work, I mean, plus our whole lives are there. What would we do, just abandon everything? I'm just saying, think about it? Let's play a game. - A game? - Yeah. Um. - What game do you wanna play? Let's play poker. - You wanna play poker? - I'm good at poker. Okay, do you have the cards? Poker chips? I mean, like, it's not gonna be that much fun without any poker chips. No, I wouldn't say that, John. Hey, hey! Whoa, hey, man, who the fuck are you? - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I wouldn't do that if I was you. What is this, man, huh, what the fuck do you want? Is this how you treat a guest? Hey. - May I sit? - Hey, man, hey, whatever this is, man, it ain't fucking funny, all right? It isn't funny at all, what would be? John. John. Hey, man. Hey, look, we'll give you whatever you want, man, all right, please just, just stop pointing the gun at her. Do you see that, Rebecca? This is John way try to take some sort of control back in this situation. You have lost control, John. Okay, all right, hey, hey, what can I do, huh? Huh, what can I do? I'll tell you what you can do. How about you fill that shaker with ice and grab everything you need in order to make one of those perfect martinis of yours? - Now? - Yes, John, now. If it takes more than a minute, I shoot your wife. Chop, chop. Don't do anything stupid, I can see her forehead from here perfectly. Okay. It's okay, sweetheart. Hurry up, John, the clock is ticking. Here we go, John. Thank you kindly. Have a seat. Whoa, this is a perfect martini, John. It's like a confection for bartender. Why you don't drink? Sweethearts, come on, have a sip. You're a sick man. Do I look like sick for you? Do I look like sick for you? I mean, John, do I look like sick for you? 'Cause I feel so healthy right now. Fuck! Damn, eh, fuck, I just wanna play our little game, man. I need you to put these on, guys. Come on, John, have a seat over there. I said now, John, - All right. - Have a seat over there. - All right, all right, okay, okay, all right. Chop chop, sweetheart. Have a seat there. I want your left hand, her right hand. Hey, you never told us your name. My name is what? My name is who? What's your name? Hey! Hey, are you okay? Hey, okay, okay, all right, all right. Put them on. Could you squeeze them a little bit more? You know, there is something so satisfy about that sound. Like this. There you go, John. What now? That's the question, John. We could watch a movie, how about that? I'm not sure, did you guys ever finish "The Night of the Living Dead?" Or, or maybe you can lead us through some yoga. That would be nice, Becky. It's okay. No, John, it isn't okay at all. But it will be, I promise you. Why, why are you doing this, huh? I've been playing this game since I was 16 years old. My father passed it on to me, and I must play one per year, every year until I lose or I die. It is what it is. This is the way it has to be. But why us? Why do you have to do this to us? We don't deserve this. Why not you? Why not you? I mean, what makes you more special than any other couples in any other cabin in this little town? Why you? Well, I'm afraid just the luck of my draw. I'm curious though, would you ever replace yourself with an innocent couple? Interesting. I'm always so intrigued at this moment between any couples. Okay. Okay, what happens now, huh? Straight to the point, I like that about you, John. But, you know, maybe sometimes Becky will love a little bit more of foreplay. You son of a bitch. All right, John, all right, John, I think it's time to play our game, right? Now, I assume you both are familiar with the game of War. Good. This is my beauty, my extremely reliable beauty. I'm gonna place a bullet in one of the chamber. We play by the rules of War, then the loser, they're gonna play their own game of Russian roulette. We play until there only two of us left, and I'm gonna be in every bit as much as you are. Exciting, right? Who goes first? Meeny, miny, moe, let's put our fate in Rebecca hands. Would you like to draw it first? No. What you mean no? I'm not gonna take part in your sick little game, if you wanna see someone dead, you can pick up that gun and take your own life. This isn't on us. This is you being a psycho, okay, we didn't do anything. Becky, the rules are simple. If you refuse to play, that's called forfeit. So Any card that we draw will be higher than yours. So if you keep this route, this game will be fairly quick. The choice is yours, baby. God, John. - Goddammit. - John, what do we do? Draw a card, Rebecca. Bravo, John, bravo. Draw the card. - Oh, Jesus. - I mean, there is plenty below her. Action on you, John, you now. Oh, God. Okay. Oh, okay. So, lucky number seven. Yes! I'm not so lucky today, huh, John? Go ahead. Ah! Told you this was exciting. Ooh! Fuck. How many times have you done this? Are you sure you want to know that? 17 people, they come and go the touch of this gun since it came into my life. Yes, John, now you know. Jesus. Well, I'm not a believer, but if the Bible is true, I'm sure it's on your side. You're not dead yet, John, you're not dead yet. How they say, winner, winner, chicken dinner, right? - Oh, fuck. Goddammit. It's okay, it's okay, baby, it's okay, it's okay. Oh my gosh, - John. - It's okay. Hey, I'll take this one. - I'll take. - Don't you fucking touch the gun or I'm gonna shoot her.
