[dramatic music] [glass shattering] [ominous music] - Come on man, you gotta redeem yourself. - [Micheal] Na, I don't wanna be late, I'm on the same shift as Sonja Meyers. You should come by the pool man, watch your boy put the moves on one of the world's hottest life guards. - Can't man I got chores. - [Micheal] Brutal, well don't die man. - I'll try not to. Later man. - [Micheal] Later big homie. [door creaking] - Mom. Rach. Hello. [heavy breathing] [door creaking] - Hey. Whoa, please don't! - Colton! What the hell are you doing? - There's a guy mom. - Oh, I am so, so sorry about this. - It's okay. Hey man, my bad, I was just looking for the bathroom and I got kinda lost. - Would somebody please tell me what the hell is going on? - Okay, sorry. Colton, this is Roger. Roger, this is my son Colton. - Hey man, didn't mean to scare ya. - What's up dude? - Roger and I met on, we're going to Delzano's for a drink. - Oh, Delzano's, cool, yeah, that's great. Did you get that necklace there? - Okay, would you just excuse us just for a minute. - Sure. Hey dude, it was nice to meet you. - I told him to go through the side door 'cause I know how much it upsets you when I go out with anybody. - No, not fair. It's not that, it's the fact that you meet these people on a app that my friends use. - Well, what do you want me do, wait for your dad to come crawling back? - You know I'd slam the door in his face if he did. But come on he smells like cedar chips. Mom, he's wearing a safety pin on bracelet. - Okay, you know what Colton? I'm really struggling here. I need you to make this easier on me, not harder. Can you just do that for me, please? - Fine. - Here. Okay, can you just please make sure that all the chores are done in the morning? - Why do you want me to do all the lame crap dad used to do? Why do you want me to be like that dick? - You know what, if you wanna talk like an adult you better start acting like one. Your father was a dick for leaving us not for taking care of this house. Now do it, please. - God. Dad, why we gotta varnish the chair? We just did it six months ago. Well son, because a man-- [paint splashing] Shit! - Ooh, you said the S word. - Rach, not helpful. - Okay, mom's home. She said, "To tell you when dinner's ready." But maybe I won't. - Dammit Rach, seriously. - You shouldn't swear, what if the neighbor's hear? - Yeah, well we don't know them, okay, so I guess it doesn't matter. Just tell mom I'll be in when I'm done with this, all right. And hey, don't tell her about this. Deal? Serious, Rach. - [Rachel] Colton spilled that chair stuff-- - Oh my God-- - On the patio today. - Rachel. - Take it easy. Come on you're gonna have to start getting along better, starting now. - Why? Dropping her off on camp on Monday. - The wild fire threat is too high this year so camp is canceled. - That's too bad. So you're not going to Barcelona then. - Oh, no, no, no, I'm going. Listen as you know things have not been going great around here for me lately so I need this trip with the girls, it's only two weeks. - It's not two weeks, Mom. It's 16 days. - [Lisa] Good memory, sweetie. You're right. - Well Mom, what's Rachel gonna do? - Well, you're a grownup now, and as a grownup I need you to take on this responsibility that is taking-- - No. - Care of her and this house. - What? - Don't make this worse. She's already upset about missing camp. And you know what, you're not gonna have this time together once you go off to college, just take advantage of it. - Take advantage of it. Mom, you said, "I could have the house to myself for two weeks." - 16 days, dummy. - Yeah, exactly, 16 days of me in charge so watch it, there's a new sheriff in town. - Stop, don't act that way towards your sister. You know what, I am done trying to keep the peace between the both of you anymore. I just-- - Good. - You're excused, Colton. - Thank you. - Don't forget to take out the trash. - [Rachel] Can I have his dessert? - Sure you can, sweetie. - Don't be lamer than you already are. Sorry mom, but according to you I'm an adult now so. [ominous music] What's with that creepy place over there, Mom? - [Lisa] You mean the old place across the street. - Yeah, did anybody ever live there, like before I was born or anything? - I don't think I've ever seen anyone come in or out since we moved in. I think it's abandoned. - That's weird, I saw something in there last night. I thought maybe somebody moved in. [laughing] - Oh, you say somebody's living in that place. - No man, I saw a light in there the other night. You ever seen anybody in there? - Nope but some skater kids broke in a while ago. - [Colton] Yeah. - Yeah, they all vanished. Never heard from again. [laughing] - No, man I'm serious I saw a light, all right. - Light. - Yeah. - What light, Colton? - I don't know, it disappeared. - Disappeared, huh? Cool story, Colt. I always wanted to bust in there and throw like a lit ass Halloween party. Oh, and on that note, taking the boat out this Saturday. What's your deal? - Can't man, mom's going on a two week vacation so I gotta babysit my stupid sister. - Dude, that's perfect. You invite somebody over to keep you company. They love babysitting. - Oh yeah, that's great. Yeah, I'll invite somebody over, my sister will be a third wheel it'll be awesome, yeah. Maybe she can cook for us. Yeah, Rachel'll cook for us. That'll be great. - Hold on, hold on. Phone ringing. Look my shift is starting okay. But we gonna work on that girl situation. - Yep. - [Micheal] Get you a girl, bro. - Ah-ha. [ominous music] What the hell? [camera snaps] Oh, shit. Dammit. Damn. - [Lisa] Careful sweetie. - Maybe a few less rocks next time. - Hey, I know this is a lot to ask and I didn't mean for you to have to grow up this fast but it's just the way things turned out. But I wouldn't have asked you to do this if I didn't really need it. - I know, Mom. - I need you to guarantee me that you're gonna just take care of things while I'm gone. Can I count on you? - Yes, Mom. I'll hold it down, I swear. - I know you will. Okay, no more backseat driving, promise. - I could still use a few pointers. - [Rachel] Mom, I'm ready. - [Colton] All right. - Tell him. - [Lisa] Colton, I did tell your sister that you would take her for ice cream after. - [Colton] All right. - So you have to. - [Colton] Only if she's buying. - [Lisa] Okay, seat belts. - I have all summer. [ominous music] Okay, okay. [ominous music] Who moves in all by themselves in the middle of the night? - Dude, I don't know. Maybe you were dreaming. - No, I know what I saw. - Hey, doesn't this seem like overkill? - I'm responsible for Rachel, okay. If there's a midnight creeper moving in across the street I need to know. - [Micheal] Dude, yeah, this thing cost like over $600. - Yeah, it's expensive. - Oh, well if you're splurging buy me those headphones. What? - What? All right man. Gonna be worth that 600 bucks baby. Gotta get a screw. All right, got the ladder? - I got you. - Want me to do this? Thank you. - One more. Thank you sir. All right. And it's good. - How we do it. Ooh. - [Colton] Okay. [door knocking] [door creaking] - Why are you always watching that house? I know you made all of that up. You're weird. - Rachel, remember what I said about new sheriff in town. Think of me as mom now, meaning if you slip up I can punish you. Meaning no more dessert, no TV, no scoters. - You're not gonna do it. You're too scaredy-cat to even go over there. - What are you doing? - Jesus! I'm Colton. I live across the street. Who are you? - I live here. Did you just try to get into our basement? - No. I'm sorry, I didn't think anybody lived here. Nobody's lived here for a really long time and I could've sworn that I saw this, you know, I should've knocked. I really should've knocked. I'm sorry, I hope I didn't startle you. - It's okay. We just moved in. We're definitely the first people to live here in a while. - Yeah. Welcome to the neighborhood. - I'm Heather. - Oh, Colton. I'm really sorry, I shoulda knocked. - It's okay. I have to go now. - Okay. Sorry. Yeah, man, I guess it was her dad that I saw but the dude was like super old. But anyway I stopped filming 'cause I don't wanna be like creep you know. But if get her on camera then I'm definitely a creep so. - [Micheal] Dude, this is money. I told you this was gonna be your summer. Yo, invite her to the lake. I'm taking the boat out tomorrow and the whole crew is coming. - No man, I can't I got Rachel so. - [Micheal] Look my mom's office is closed tomorrow right, she can watch her for the afternoon. The timing is perfect. - Wait, really? - [Micheal] Yeah, really. I got you man. All right, now get off the couch and go over there and invite her. - How'd you know I was on the couch? - [Micheal] Oh, go, go. - All right, all right, all right, fine. - [Micheal] Hang up. - All right, call you after man. - Oh. - Heather, hey. - [Heather] Hi. - Oh. - Are you? - Oh. That's nothing. How's it going? - Okay. We're all moved in now I guess. - Oh, nice. - Is there something you needed? - I actually was wondering my buddy Mike and his family have a boat and it's out on the lake and he, well we are gonna have a little party, you know get some people together, and I was wondering if, you know if you're free if maybe you wanted to come join us? But if you have stuff going on or if you don't want to I totally get it. - That's so awesome. - Great, cool. Yeah, I can totally drive us. - I just, I don't think that I can. - Oh. - I'm sorry. - Okay. Yeah, no worries. - My dad, he's really strict. I can't go out much. - Totally understand. Yeah, maybe we can find another time or you know find something else to do sometime. You know something more in line with your values or whatever. I get the pushy parents thing. - It's actually just me and my dad. - Oh, oh, cool. No siblings or anything? - No, I wish. - Well, if you're in the market I got a sister I can sell to ya pretty cheap. But a, yeah, so what are you and your dad doing this part of town, if you don't mind me asking? - Actually the last place we had was foreclosed on so we've had a lot of money problems. - That sucks. I'm sorry to hear that, it must be tough. - I should go. - Oh. - Sorry. - Okay, yeah, no worries. I'll just hang out around here so if you ever wanna hang out. Bye, Heather. Stupid. [ominous music] [scary music] - Have you seen Fluffy Ruffles? She didn't come home yesterday. Colton, are you listening to me? - Yes, Rachel, I hear you. Fluffy Ruffles has ghosted on us for days you know that. She'll be back. [gentle music] [ominous music] Oh shit. Shit. Oh shit. - What are-- - Jesus, Rachel! - What are you doing with all of this? - None of your business, okay. Now go back to your room. - It doesn't look like any of your business either. - Well, it's less of your business. - Your science partner is here. - My what? - Your science partner, she's waiting for you. - School's been out for two weeks, I don't have a science partner. - She said she was. She's waiting in the TV room. - [Colton] Oh. - Give me one good reason not to call the cops. - Okay, look I know that this looks really bad but I promise you I am not a weirdo. Okay, can I just show you something, just one thing? Okay. Now if you still wanna go to cops I understand and I won't stop you but if you do maybe you wanna show them this. Okay, I know it's none of my business but I think your dad is-- - He's not my real dad. I was adopted recently. It's not like he raised me. Look, I appreciate your concern but you don't need to worry about him. He's old and probably confused. But he treats me well. So just delete all of this and take the cameras down, okay. - Look you don't have to tell me anything you don't want to obviously but you know maybe if he is up to something maybe I can find out, you know, about him or the house, if you just give me one more night, you know I won't get in between the two of you I promise. - You can keep them up for one more night. - Awesome. All right, thank you. Okay. - Dude, why you makin' us do homework right now? Did someone not tell you that it's summer? - Just humor me all right. The lake will be there tomorrow. - Look I researched all the headlines from 1951 to 52 and nada, okay. This town has always been boring. Yo, you find anything? - Shit, yeah, dude here. Check this out. - [Micheal] Let's see. - [Colton] Our neighborhood burnt to a crisp. Look at that. - Hold up, only one residence intact. One residence. - [Colton] Yeah, ready to have your mind blown? Look at this. Bam. - [Micheal] You're kidding me? - No, dude that's why all of our houses are you know like modern and stuff except for that one, okay. How does only one house survive? - Four isn't enough. - No, the night vision on surveillance camera's only guaranteed to 100 feet and the zoom's digital. This has an 85mm lens and shoots 4K. So better night vision and image stabilization. - [Micheal] It is nice man. What you got? - Nothing man, you? - Yeah, swing out to 23 20. - 23 20. Oh, no. - [Micheal] What the hell? - Oh dude, Mr. Burrows. - Of course, I guess he still must be teaching 9th grade. All right, yeah, that's it for me. I'm off to this party so are you, come on. - No, no, no, I'm gonna stay here and find out more. You have fun though. - All right, call me if you need me. - [Colton] Will do. - [Micheal] All right, man. [ominous music] [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] - I can't believe it. - I know right, how's that even possible? Are you okay? Did he do that? - No, I got kind of lightheaded last night, fell down. - I actually recorded. Do you have any idea what he's doing? Hey, did he ever tell you why he adopted you? - I've actually always wondered too. I guess he's just old and didn't have anyone in his life. - I got you a little something. On TV they call it a burner. - Duh. - Right. If you ever need to call me in an emergency or you know if you ever just wanna talk to somebody cool. I'm sorry is that too much? - My new phone number. Isn't this how they do it in movies? - Yeah, totally, in the old movies before cellphones were invented. [laughing] Heather, I never asked you your last name. - Oh, I guess now it's Torvald. - Torvald, that would not have been my first guess. - Yeah, I'm still getting used to it. - So that your new dad's name. - Yeah. He's name is Magnus Torvald. - So he's a viking. [laughing] - I guess. Call me later. - Yeah, sure. Bye. [dramatic music] Wanna help? [ominous music] [camera snaps] [camera snaps] Hey there, I'm Colton from across the street. Wonder if Heather was home or if she could come out? I'm a friend of hers. - No. - Oh, okay, if you could just tell her I said hey, really appreciate it. Oh. All right. See what you've been shopping for. [ominous music] - You're in luck, our policy is to destroy records after 20 years but only if the case is closed. - Oh, so was this case never solved? - Well, I'd never heard of it until you called but when I read the file it reminded me of something we'd a, we used to get calls about way back, I mean when I first joined. - Really, like what, if you don't mind me asking? - Well, have you ever heard of satanic ritual abuse? - No. - It was all the TV in the 80s, hundreds of cases reported. You know televangelist claiming heavy metal music was making people turn to devil worship. Law enforcement never found any evidence of it. It was total hysteria but you know stories like that they make for some great copy. - That's, that's crazy man. Yeah, I really appreciate it. - Yeah. - Yeah, all right, thank you. - [Officer Huang] Take care. [dramatic music] - Yeah, these old directories have the address and the name. It's the same guy. It's like he's been here for 70 years either that, you know either that or he's like owned the place. - [Micheal] Are you sure it's the same dude or it's just the same name? - Honestly man I have no idea but it's weird. I'll call you back. [phone ringing] Come on, Heather. [coughing] [phone ringing] [coughing] [phone ringing] [coughing] Dammit. And then Eugene the unicorn and his newfound friends enjoyed troughs, and troughs, and troughs full of sticky molasses oats. [suspenseful music] - [Micheal] So this guy. - [Colton] Magnus Torvald. - Okay, who might be like a hundred years old, he's old, sacrificed that Polly Feagan girl to the Devil. - Yeah. - And you think he's going to do the same thing to Heather. - Yeah. - Okay, well, I'm gonna go call a paddy wagon for you 'cause this-- - Look I don't, I can't prove the satanic stuff, okay, I don't know if that's real but there's definitely been some weird shit going on. Okay, what about all the missing cat posters around town? - [Micheal] Cats. - Satanic ritual abuse. I'm serious man, look it up they take cats. - So let's say, no, actually let's not say you're right, not even hypothetically, why won't she just tell the cops what's going on man? - Because she's too afraid of him. - [Micheal] Then Child Protective Services. - You can't just call Child Protective Services, okay. I don't have enough stuff. Okay, the videos that I have aren't proof of anything other than I'm a pervert, peeping Tom or something. - Then get enough. [ominous music] - [Heather] I can leave the backdoor unlocked but I can't turn a light on without him seeing it and it's so dark in here at night. - [Colton] Don't worry, I got a light. And where's your room? - [Heather] Upstairs but his bedroom is right next to the landing and the floors are so creaky, I don't know. - [Colton] It's cool, I've got ninja skills. [voices chattering] [voices chattering] [voices chattering] [voices chattering] [scary music] - The last door on the other left. I know but it's bigger than the room I had growing up, I swear. - No judgment. - What? Do I look okay? - Yeah, of course. No, yeah, you look beautiful. How do you feel? - I'm exhausted but I can never sleep. I have these nightmares. Colton, what's happening to me? - I don't know but I'm gonna get ya out of here. An you're gonna get better. I'm gonna treat you right, the way you deserve. [door knocking] [door pounding] - [Magnus] Can I come in? - [Heather] I'm going to sleep. What do you want? - [Magnus] I need to come in. - No, you don't. Go away. - This is my house and for every moment you spend in my house you gotta obey the rules. Why'd you lock this door? [door crashing] What are you hiding in here? - Nothing. Now get out my room you miserable old bastard. - [Magnus] Nothing. Nothing. What's this? - Fine, you found it. Now get out of my room! - [Magnus] Someone gave this to you. [scary music] [screaming] [glass shattering] [suspenseful music] - What are you doing? We gotta get out of here now. - No, that won't be enough. He'll get me back again you have to get more. - Got you now you son of a bitch. - [Operator] Officers should be arriving any minute. Just to confirm you are available in case the officers have questions for you 'cause you can remain anonymous. - No, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm available, yeah. - [Operator] Okay, we'll send someone out right now. - Great, great, thank you. Oh yeah. Yes. You're going down buddy. Got you on camera too. Come on, come on, where are you? No, no, no. What about invasion of privacy that's a crime, right? - And what specifically are you referring to? Something you saw that you're prepared to testified about under oath. - I need to show you something, all right, okay. This is hooked up to my home surveillance system and just if just you push right there. - [Officer Johnson] You're saying you just gathered this incidentally. - Yeah. - I notice that all four cameras are pointed in the same direction. Typically these are used to cover as much of your own property as possible. - Of course, right, yeah, no, that's, that's all that I have installed at the moment. I'm waiting on a check so I can get some more cameras in the back. - [Officer Johnson] These yours? - Binoculars? Those are my dad's. He's a bird watcher. - You said, "Your father's gone. Looks like you're using 'em. - Right, yeah, no, I do a little birding myself too. I don't know if you saw the pictures in the living room. - Look son, I was young once full of crazy ideas. Now what I told you at the station that was just hysteria but a lot of innocent people's lives got ruined by it. What you showed me right here could easily be construed as invasion of privacy, harassment. Now I talked him out of filing a restraining order against you. - The guy's abusing her, okay, I swear to you. I just, I might not have the footage-- - Consider this officially on notice. Your neighbor's lives are their own, next time there won't be a warning, understood. - Yes. - [Officer Huang] Okay. [ominous music] [phone ringing] - Hey, hey, how'd you get the phone back? Heather. - [Magnus] Don't hang up. Listen to me she sick, understand? She's not coming out anymore. Not until she gets well. I will be by her side every minute praying for her recovery. Until then leave her alone. - You think it'll work? - What him praying over her, serious? - Power of belief. Whatever, look my mom believes in all that laying on of hands type stuff. - I just wish I knew what caused it. She's not contagious otherwise I would have it. - No, you didn't. - [Colton] What? - [Micheal] You did. - Little bit, we kissed. - My man. - Look she's in danger, okay. Just we need to put this guy away, all right. No one's gonna do this but us. [ominous music] [scary music] No, no, no. Oh shit! Shit! No, no, no. [scary music] [phone ringing] Hey dude, got a big favor to ask. [door knocking] Hey. - Yo, you didn't bring that past my mom did you? - Thank you so much again man, it'll just be a couple weeks. - Weeks, forget it man, nah. Take this back man, I'm not doing it. - Dude, I wouldn't have asked you if I didn't think this was the only way, come on. - Yo, this cabin fever thing you got going is really taking you over the edge. Now look, I met some cool cats at the lake last time, call 'em up, maybe go hang out, chill, let's do something-- - Look man, she's gonna die if I don't save her, all right, period. And he might get away with it. - All right, fine. But if you catch this guy, hey, we both go on CNN. - Of course. - Okay, and if you see my cat through that thing you holler at me, huh. - Yeah, all right. - Here kitty, kitty. Fluffy Ruffles. Come here, Fluffy. Fluffy. Come here. Fluffy. Fluffy. [cat meowing] Is that you, Fluffy? [cat meowing] [lips smacking] [scary music] - What? No, no, no, no, no, no. - [Micheal] You know the drill. - Hey man, can you check the connection on your camera the feed's getting all weird? And call me back, all right. Bye. [ominous music] What the hell are you doing? [speaking in foreign language] [screaming] Come on, Mike. Shit. - All right, I'll see ya at the pool. - It's funny, huh? - Yeah. - You're gonna leave me. - [Sonja] Bye. [phone ringing] - Dammit. Yo, what's up? - Tonight's the night dude. I'm going in. - Colton, oh no, no, no, no. Why now? - [Colton] Because he's up to something. I don't think we have much time left, all right. How did Heather look on your camera? - I was kinda indisposed but her curtain's closed now though. Did you wanna jail break her out? - [Colton] No, I need a drill to unscrew those locks, the son of a bitch did a good job. Just please pay attention when I go in there, okay, text is best. - What you gonna do, kill him? - Don't be insane. He has to be doing some seriously disturbing shit up there. Find out what so maybe they'll give us [faintly speaking]. [laughing] - I can't believe I'm be an accomplice to this shit. - [Colton] Just keep an eye on that asshole, all right. Make sure you don't become an accessory to a homicide. Okay, bye, Mike. - Oh shit. Yeah, that's it. [glass shattering] This is cake, buddy. Hurry man, don't waste time! Oh shit, oh shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit. [suspenseful music] Shit, shit. Oh God, oh shit, oh God, oh God. [phone ringing] Come on. Dammit man! [scary music] Shit. Get out man, get out, get out! Oh shit, move, move man, move! [scary music] Yes, go baby, go! - Shit. [groaning] Damn, what happened man? You almost got me killed. - Yo, I texted, I called, I texted, almost called the cops. - Then what the hell happened? [phone beeping] Oh shit. - Told you man. Now what'd you see in there? Did you get any proof? - Dude, no. I was right man, this guy's up to something very, very bad, okay. - So do we call the cops now? - No, forget it. I'm going back over there dude, I gotta get her out of there. And I totally understand man, you don't have to help me anymore I get it. - Shut up, man. Just tell me when. - All right, all right, I'll call you. [ominous music] [scary music] [speaking in foreign language] [suspenseful music] No, no, no, no, no! Bastard! I'm gonna call the cops! You touch a hair on her head I'll kill you! Oh shit! Rachel! Rachel! Help! Somebody help! [door pounding] No! - Will he be okay? - Sure you wanna do this man? - You didn't see the ax he as carrying. You need backup. - Love you bro. [glass shattering] - Oh, what the. - Hey Heather, can you hear me? It's me Colton. I'm gonna get you out of there okay, just give me a sec, all right. - Oh, what the. Oh, oh, you sick piece of. Where are you? Bastard, where you at? Oh shit. - Hey. Heather, wake up. I got ya, I got ya, I got ya. I'm gonna get you out of here, okay. - He's in here. He'll kill you. - No, I'm gonna get you out of this, okay. You understand me? - You're crazy. - Only fools rush in. Come on, let's go. [scary music] Rachel. Hey, Rachel! Rachel. Hey! - He told me to make sure you didn't get into trouble. - Who told you that, who did? - He said."You're a good person "but you're doing a bad thing." - [Colton] Rachel, get over here. Hey! - Traced the call to this address. Couldn't hear anything he was saying but clearly distressed. Drop the weapon! Drop the weapon, drop the weapon! [groaning] Colton, Colton, can you hear me? [gentle music] You all right, Rachel? - Rach. - She might be in shock. The EMT said, "She'll be okay." They took Micheal to the hospital but he'll be just fine. - I gotta do one more thing, okay. And then we'll go home, all right. So it's true all of it. About the great fire, murdered that Feagan girl. - You don't understand boy, there's no time. - You don't gotta worry about time anymore, got all the time in the world now. - No, you don't. - [EMT] She's coming around. - Yes, I was there. The parents of the Feagan girl they brought her up to me when they realized that this child was not meant to be. I mean she looked like a human child but she was demon conceived in the sight of the Prince of Evil. So I performed the rites and after 13 days I summoned the shades of abyss to come up and to take her back once she came, back to hell. Your sister learned the truth. I tried to help her. [ominous music] Shh. Her parents discovered the truth and so did the orphanage. They gave her to me to banish her back to the lake of fire before she grew strong. - [EMT] How's that? - I'm hungry. - Oh, yeah, anything I can get you miss? - How about a nice fat fucking house cat? - I told them how to contain her evil until I could bring her under my control. I preformed the rites, I weakened her. - You're an exorcist. - I summon the shades to come forth on 13th day of the ritual. Now they're coming any moment and if she is not inside that house they won't take her. Now for the love of Almighty God you are the only one that could do something now. You're the only one. - [Officer Huang] We still have a lot to discuss, I'll call you. You did good kid. [siren wailing] [ominous music] - Rachel! Rachel! Heather! Rachel! [fire roaring] [house creaking] Heather. - [Rachel] Colton, help! - [Colton] No! Rachel! [lightning crackling] [dragon roaring] [ominous music]
