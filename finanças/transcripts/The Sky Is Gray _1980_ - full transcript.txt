(chiming piano music) (melancholy piano music) - Ow. (buzzing) - It's still hurtin' huh? You can't talk? You won't tell nobody? I sure woulda told somebody. My tooth was hurtin' me, I sure woulda told somebody. (brooding acoustic guitar music) - Alright y'all. (pouring water) Hit it, James. Your mama be through preppin' everything by the time you get there. And you too, Ty. Wear your hat. James? How long your teeth been hurtin' you? - I ain't got no toothache. - Whose jaw was you holdin' last night? Go on in there and get you some aspirin. Jigger down there. Wrap it up in some cotton first. (bouncy acoustic guitar strumming) (thrashing) (pigs grunting) (lamb whining) - [James] Got you wussy. - Ow! - Psshew pshew. - Pshew. (moaning) (high-pitched hollering) - [Ty] We should avail. Come on! (hollering) (fast-paced fiddle music) (laughing, hollering) - Through my fault. Through my most grievous fault. How you feelin'? - Same. - Through the power of the holy ghost. Through him, with him. In the name of the father, (yelling) and the son. Still hurtin'? - Yes sir. - What kind of prayers you prayin', boy? - Baptist. - Ooooh, no wonder that tooth is still killin' him. I'm goin' one way and he's pullin' another. - Mhmm. - [Monsieur] Boy, don't you know any Catholic prayers? - I know Hail Mary. - Mhmm. Well, you better start sayin' 'em. - Yes sir. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. - The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongs women. (moaning) And blessed is the fruit our womb, Jesus. (screaming) How's that? - It stopped. It don't hurt no more. - James, come here. You done caught a couple of birds in your trap. - I did? Oh mama, can I keep 'em? Me and Ty could train 'em. I could raise 'em mama. - Rosemary, get me a fork. - Ty. - Make a fine meal, Octavia. - [Ty] I got it. I got it. - I can't. - James, take this fork. - Please mama, I can't kill 'em. - Take this fork, James. Get him outta there. - I can't mama. - Get him out of there, James. (chicken squawking) Give it here. (squawking) That's one. Get the other. - Please mama. I'll do anything, but don't make me do this. - James, get him out of there. Get him out, James. Get him out. - Octavia, explain to the child. Don't just beat him. Explain to him. - James. Get him out. - Ty. Come on. Come on. (crying) (high-pitched daunting music) (squawking) James, my boy, you did a good job. - Sure did. - Yep, a pretty good job. I needed meat. (laughing) - How you feel? - James, tomorrow we goin' to town. - But it ain't hurtin' me no more, mama. See. I can eat anything you want. And I can get the work done. - We're goin' to town tomorrow. I'm tired. Goin' to bed. Goodnight y'all. You and Ty don't be too far behind me, James. - That boy is just like his daddy. It's a damn shame the way they took him away and they ain't even give Octavia enough to help with them children. But that's the Army for ya. And they didn't get me and they ain't ever gonna get me. - Shhh, you're gonna wake 'em up. Besides, they don't need to hear that. - Well it's the God's truth. She's workin' out in them fields rain or shine tryin' to make ends meet. That just ain't right. But a sweet little thang like you shouldn't have to mess herself up out workin' in them fields. - Shhh. - Alright. Alright, but one day, they gonna find out. - Well all we can do is what we doin'. Rest is in his hands. Ain't for us to question. - Yeah, yep, I guess you right. Well sugam, let's talk about me and you. - [Rosemary] I wish you'd just stay quiet. - [Monsieur] Alright, I'll be quiet. (smooching) I ain't said nothin' honey. Oh, that's so nice. (giggling) - Well I got enough to go and come back. Let's see. A dollar and a half. After tooth pull, nickel for me to go. A nickel for him. Dime to come back. Fifty cents left. Guess I could get a little piece of salt meat with that. - Sure can use it. White beans and no salt meat, just seem like beans. - It sure ain't. Better get ready. We can catch the noon bus and still work the fields this afternoon. (blowing wind) (church inspired piano music) James. (church organ and piano music) (bouncy jazz music) (lively piano music) (kids chattering) Stay in front of me. (groaning) (people chattering) (groaning) (speech muffled out by groaning) - Is that your friend in there? - That's my friend. (grunting groan) - John Lee Williams. - I gotta go. - Come on in. - [Nurse] You seein' the dentist? - Yes. - [Nurse] What's his name. - I don't want to go! No. (kid screaming) - Man, I thought they was killin' you in there. Howlin' like a pig under a gate. (laughing) (kid screaming) - Why the Lord let that child suffer like that? - It's not for us to question. - Sometimes, maybe we should. - I know definitely we shouldn't. - Why? - Why anything? - Why he let us poor folks suffer the most? I don't understand it. (kid screaming) - Best not to try. He works in mysterious ways. Has wonders to perform. - We should question and question, question everything. (kid screaming) - Maybe you can explain what you mean. - I meant what I said. Question everythang. - Me and this lady was talkin' about God. - Question him too. - Now wait a minute. Just wait a minute. - Show me one reason to believe in the existence of a god. - My heart tells me. - My heart tells me. My heart pumps blood throughout my body. Nothin' else. We supposed to question everything. Freedom, liberty, God, white, colored. What do all those words mean? - That's what we educatin' 'em for. To be mad at the world. - You ain't educatin' me. Now I wash dishes at night so I can go to school in the day. Because I ask questions you call me mad. - I'm sorry for you. - You feel sorry for yourself because a white man told you to believe in God and why? To keep you ignorant so he can keep his foot on your neck. - So now I's ignorant too? - Yeah, you ignorant. (kid screaming) - Get up boy. (smacking) (gasping) - You forgot the other cheek. (smacking) (gasping) It ain't changed a thing. (church organ music) - I feel sorry for you. Y'all excuse me. I come back some other time. Please excuse me. (kid moaning) - They got some books over there, mama. Want to read one of 'em? Can I? (drilling) (groaning) (drilling) - You really don't believe in God? - No. - Why? - Because the wind is pink. (chortling) - That's a good one. Yes sir, that's a good one. - You don't believe the wind is pink? - Sure I do, honey. Sure I do. What color is grass? - Grass? Grass is black. (laughing) You don't believe it. - Grass is green. It was green yesterday. It's green today, and it is goin' to be green tomorrow. - Prove it's green. - Oh, this not gon' come to that is it? - Words mean nothing. One no more than the other. Now it's green 'cause someone told you it's green. If they told you it was black, you'd believe that. Action is the only thing. Doin'. Words mean nothin'. - I didn't agree with that preacher before, but now I don't know. When somebody say that grass is black either he's a lunatic or somethin' is wrong. - Prove to me it's green. - It's green 'cause people say it's green. - The same people who says you's a citizen. - Well I think I'm a citizen. - Citizens have rights. Name me one right you have. One right granted by the Constitution you can exercise in Bayonne. (kid grumbling) - Things is changin'. - 'Cause we thinkin' with our head and not our hearts. - Are the new models all like you? - I hope not ma'am. I don't believe in your gods. I was born too late. I just hope your children have a better chance than me. I don't believe in anything. For me the wind is pink. And grass is black. (acoustic guitar strumming) (sobbing) (bouncy piano music) (people chattering) - The doctor will not be seein' any more patients 'til one o'clock this afternoon. - Nurse, I've got to go back to the fields this afternoon. - Doctor's treatin' his last patient now. - Can I at least speak to the doctor? - I'm his nurse. - My little boy's sick. His tooth's almost killin' him. - [Nurse] This afternoon. (bouncy piano music) - Come on. (brooding guitar and piano music) You have to make water? - [James] No ma'am. (wind blowing) - James, keep your eyes in front. (brooding guitar and piano music) Come on. (men chattering) Got any ax handles? (men chattering in French) James. (bouncy piano and guitar strumming) Come on. You hungry? - No ma'am. - You wanna eat and walk back or you rather don't eat and ride? - I ain't hungry. - Come on. (bouncy jazz music) - I ain't hungry, mama. - Got to pay 'em somethin' for the heat. Could I have a couple of those cakes, coffee, and a milk please? (chattering) - I can't eat all this, mama. (laughing) - Watch this. - Yeah OK, we'll see. - Keep your eyes on your plate. (coin clanking) (jazz piano love song) - Dance pretty? * I won't be such a fool * The way I was with you * Next time I'll know this is love * Next time I'll know * A kiss that lasts forever (jazz horns) * The feeling doesn't pass * They only really last * If this is really love (crashing thud) (laughing) - Some pimp. - James, stay there. Come on. I'll gut you from your navel to your throat. Come on. - You some pimp, yes sir. You a pimp all right. Yes siree. (laughing) You don't have to leave, honey. (laughing) (brooding jazz piano music) - Stop. Y'all eat? - Just finished. - Y'all must be cold then. - We're headin' for the dentist. We'll warm up when we get there. - Which dentist? Mr. Basset? - [Octavia] Yes ma'am. - Come on in then. I'll telephone him. Tell him y'all are comin'. (wind whistling) Come on. - [Ernest] Helena? - Yes Ernest. - [Ernest] Did she see you? - They're here. Standin' in front of me. - [Ernest] Now you can stay inside. - I saw y'all each time you went by. Went out to catch you but you was gone. - We went back in town. - Did you eat? - Yes ma'am. - There's food in the kitchen. I've been keepin' it warm. - We don't take no handouts. - I'm not handin' out anythin'. I need my garbage moved to the front. Ernest has a bad cold. He can't go out. - James will move it for you. - Not unless you eat. I'm old, but I got my pride too you know. Come into the kitchen. Sit down. Not you boy. You have to move the cans. - [Ernest] Helena? - Yes Ernest. - [Ernest] Are you goin' out there again? - Imma show the boy where the garbage is. - [Ernest] Keep your shawl on. - Come on boy. There. Here, leave that can alone. Pick it up, carry it to the front. Put it on the sidewalk, and come back for the other one. (bouncy country fiddle music) Come in here boy and wash your hands. Children, I know. - [Ernest] Helena? - Yes Ernest. - [Ernest] Are they eatin'? - Yes. - [Ernest] Good, now you'll stay inside. (slow piano music) - I talked to Dr. Basset's nurse. He'll take ya just as soon as you get there. - Thank you, ma'am. - Perfectly all right. Which one is it? You're not afraid are ya? - No ma'am. - That's a good boy. Dr. Basset won't hurt ya. - Thank you. - [James] Thank you. - [Ernest] Helena? Are they leaving? - Yes Ernest. - [Ernest] Tell 'em I said goodbye. - They can hear ya, Ernest. - [Ernest] Bye mother and son. May God be with you. - Goodbye. - [James] Bye. - You sell salt meat? - Yes. - Give me two bits worth. - That isn't very much salt meat. - It's all I have. That's an awful lot of meat for a quarter. - I been sellin' salt meat behind this counter for 25 years. I think I know what I'm doin'. - You got a scale there, weigh it. - You tellin' me how to run my business? - Thank you very much for the food. James. - Just a minute. (coin clanking) - Your kindness will never be forgotten. James. (wind whirring) James, turn that collar right back down. You're not a bum. You're a man.
