Feverish? Got money for medicine? Guess not. How about you? Take the medicine and get well, or leave it and kick the bucket. You know what that means? Hell. You hear? Oh dear, you're getting worse by day. And you. The epidemic got you, too? What you need, is money for medicine. No money, tough luck. You're still young. Eat some fish, fart, and sleep. That should sort you out. Medicine... Money first. Money, money, money, money is the enemy of the times. Oh dear, Danbe, you're looking a little worse for wear. Be conscious about your looks when you've passed forty, I say. I'm bored of hearing your usual balderdash. What's wrong? Is it about the epidemic palaver? Since the well's been contaminated, the magistrate's guards are eradicating lawbreakers by beheading or ordering them to do seppuku. They'll come for you. Me? I'm just a medicine seller. Who'd benefit from the epidemic. I see... it's like that? The culprit must be evil. But I can see their motives. Our avaricious magistrate are paying for their own wrongdoings at last. Since when do you speak like a wise man, huh? I'm a pebble in a riverbed. All edges get rounded over time. The well nearby is contaminated, too. Any ideas? A demon, I heard. No one can be that savage unless it's a demon or an evil spirit. I'm looking for that demon. An outsider, I wager. I'm a samurai. Killing people is what I do. Raikan Kichiemon. As the punishment for poisoning the town's wells, I order you to commit seppuku. Like I said many times, I know nothing about that poison. Shame on you, quibbleing until the end. A woman said she saw you. You spread the disease on purpose. Did you not, Raikan? You seem so eager to watch me commit seppuku. Exasperating I may, yet I'd seppuku myself if you insist. The world today is not worth living for. Stop talking nonsense and get on with it. I must tell you one thing before I die. You are the ones spreading the epidemic. Each and every one of you has been possessed by an evil spirit. Even now, as we speak... you're letting it spread itself. And the poor are dying from it. Sucking the peasants dry with land tax under the name of governance. Shut up, outsider! The one who poisoned the wells was a demon. Not a human. Not that it matters to me. Every single one of you should go to hell! After death, you can be reborn and start over. You cannot continue exploiting the poor and making them suffer. It's your turn to go to hell. God created the epidemic out of fury. And as a punishment of your wrongdoings. If my seppuku would clear out the epidemic and save the poor, I'll cut my stomach open with honor. Then do it already! There was a rogue samurai in the red-light district, and a young lad nearby laughed at this samurai being smarmy. The lad ended up becoming a rogue himself. They ran into each other one day, and the samurai said to him "Don't beat yourself up." "A lost coin in deep snow will be lost forever," "lost love under the bridge will soon to be a telltale." "Life is short," "too short to have your questions answered." "So you, who I met in the past," "whether you will be reborn or you won't," "take a gamble and see it for yourself." I have lived my whole life with sword. One who has been following the 'right' path all one's life, is boring as fuck. A path which is barely within the law, there is pastime. Life without pastime is not worth living. On a detour you take, discover compassion. I have killed many for money. I have indulged myself with good sake and fine women. Yet I am enraged with intolerance. Of your goddamn decision! Have you ever said anything like this? Have you ever been allowed to do anything you like? Have I ever been a fawner? Over my dead body! Father, mother, and brothers, I've been nothing but the black sheep of the family. Everybody dies. Nobody can stand in my way. I'll do whatever the hell I want to do before I die. But you lot, no matter how hard you try, your lives will never be as good as mine. Just deserts! You bastards. All kinds of disgrace and sins, now purified, refreshed. The end of the epidemic at Mt. Resurrection-Wolf. Funeral procession on its path. I will be reborn as a beast. Now all of you, go seppuku yourselves!
