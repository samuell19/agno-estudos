IRENE: On December 16th, 1977, in Willmar, Minnesota, eight women, bookkeepers and tellers, employees of the Midwestern Bank, walked off their jobs and went on strike. [WOMEN GIGGLING] We walked the picket line for the next year and a half, through the bitter cold of two Minnesota winters, isolated in our own home town. [CHURCH BELLS CHIMING] Turkey.You gotta see what he's done, honey. [LAUGHING] Thank you, Grandma. TOBY: See you all later. MAN: Following you over. Bye! [HORN HONKING] CROWD: Bye! Bye! Bye. [HORN HONKING] Bye! Bye!Bye! Goodbye! IRENE: Glennis and Toby got married on November 18, 1976. They'd known each other since they were kids. Toby was going to work on his dad's farm. Glennis wanted to work in a bank. GLENNIS: Tobe! Toby! I thought we were going to the Twin Pines Inn. [EXCLAIMING] [GLENNIS LAUGHING] This is better than the Twin Pines Inn, I'll tell you that. [BOTH LAUGHING] I don't have to take you home anymore. MAN ON RADIO: And good morning, everyone. Twenty-four degrees, our present Willmar temperature reading. And some good news. Mrs. Jimmy Sorenson, Route One, wins $19 in eating at the Homestead Family Restaurant. IRENE: If you look up Willmar in the encyclopedia, you'll find it was once the center of the Great Northern Railroad. The population is 18,438. It's the county seat of Kandiyohi County, composed of farms and small businesses. Its largest industry is a turkey processing plant. Willmar is famous for its townspeople consuming more cups of coffee per capita than any other town in the United States. It has three banks, a savings and loan, one daily newspaper, and 29 churches. It's a family town, a great place to raise kids. [HORN HONKING] [CHURCH BELLS CHIMING] [PHONE RINGING] WOMAN: Mmm-hmm.MAN: It doesn't look good. [PHONE RINGING] EMILY: Good morning, Midwestern Bank. Yes, sir. One moment, please. Mr. Davis, there's a call for you on line one. Glennis? Come on in. Cold enough out for you? [CHUCKLES] No, the address goes there. I know. I know. He just started today.EMILY: Good morning, Midwestern Bank. Yes, sir. One moment, please. Mr. Otteson, there's a call for you on line four. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] DIMMICK: Yes? Glennis is here, Mr. Dimmick. Oh, uh, come in, Glennis. Sit, sit. Royal Henry tells me you want to work in a bank. Yes, I do. Hmm. Well, he speaks very highly of you, your family. Only thing that worries me is that you just got married. You're not going to get pregnant on us, are you? Oh, well, we're not planning to start a family for quite some time. Yeah, that's what they all say. [CHUCKLES] Well, we'll start you at 400 and in two or three months, if you work out, we'll make it four and a quarter. You mean 400 a month? Well, you don't have to worry about money now. You've got a husband to bring home the bacon. [CHUCKLES] You want the job? Oh, yes, I do. You can start tomorrow. Glennis? Yes, sir? Do you ever wear dresses? Is that required? No. I just think a woman should wear a dress. GLENNIS: Twenty, 40 and 50. Mrs. Simmons likes her money in plastic. Nothing as dirty as a dollar bill. Of course, Mrs. Simmons. Thank you. [PHONE RINGING] Good morning, Midwestern Bank. Yes, sir, I'll connect you. Mr. Dimmick, there's a call for you on line one. No, no, Peterson. You have to write the name. I know. You don't know. Do you mind if I borrow this fellow? [CHUCKLES] Don't mind a bit. I want to show this young man what a bank meeting is like. You're taking him? Yeah, we'll just be a couple hours. Mr. Dimmick.Yeah. I am an officer of this bank and you've never taken me to a bank meeting. Yeah. Could I please get by? I should be included in this! Donna Fern. I think I should be included! Donna Fern, what are you getting so excited about? Come on, Darryl, let's go.You're supposed to take me! Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. We'll see you later. Yeah, yeah. Yep. We'll go in my car. I'll tell you, that thing goes like a bomb.DARRYL: Yeah, I heard. [MEN CHUCKLING] [SOBBING] Donna Fern. Donna Fern, please come out. DONNA FERN: [SOBBING] I've been at this bank since it started. Come on out, Donna Fern, it's safe here. I've got feelings. Of course you have. I've got rights. I'm not just a work horse. Everybody knows you run this bank. If you quit, they'd have to close the doors. Now come on out. They take that kid. He can't even spread his own bread. [DONNA FERN SOBBING] Look at this. "Darryl Lund, son of the Dean Lunds of Willmar, "recently joined the installment loan department..." IRENE: A loan officer. He's going to be a loan officer. Lunch is almost over. Hurry. Oh. Found it. $700 a month. He's making $700 a month! That's more than I make. And I've been here eight years. [ALARM BUZZING] Go back to sleep. I can't. It's 3:30 in the morning. It isn't just the money. It's the humiliation. And having to keep my mouth shut because I need the job. I wish you could just quit. I wish I could make it so you didn't have to work. Damn him! They didn't even give me a chance at the job. After all this time, do they think that boy is more capable than I am? I mean, he has trouble filling out forms. Hey. You're the best. So you say. I'm going to be late for work. IRENE: Jane Harguth, $500 a month. She was the best proof machine operator the bank ever had. [HORN HONKING] Fast, and no mistakes. She lived with her parents. She said she didn't make enough to live alone. Sorry we're late. We couldn't get the car started. Chowder? You didn't tell me we was picking up Chowder. How you doing, Tobe? "Chowder?" It's because I barfed one day in the school cafeteria. [LAUGHING] You're not supposed to say that. That was our secret. GLENNIS: Did we have a class together? Home Ec! Where'd you sit? Next to you. [TOBY LAUGHING] TOBY: Don't mind Glenny. She was busy being a hotshot. TOBY: There you go. See you, Tobe.You be good, now, Chowder. IRENE: Sandi Treml, bookkeeper, teller, $425 a month. She met her husband, Bruce, when she was 16. On their second date, he helped her run away from home. He was an auto mechanic. I didn't know you had a girlfriend. I got plenty of them. Bye-bye. IRENE: Doris Boshart. Head bookkeeper, $600 a month. She had worked at Midwestern Bank for 10 years. She was making $100 less than Darryl was starting at. How are you, Doris? I'm mad. IRENE: Teren Novotny, bookkeeper, married, $425 a month. Shirley Solyntjes, bookkeeper, $425 a month, married to Scott. Sylvia Erickson, teller, $425 a month. She was separated from her husband, John, raising two kids. And I'm Irene Wallin, head teller, $565 a month, after eight years. Three children. My husband Rocky's held two jobs down for 22 years. Mr. Dimmick, could we have a word with you? DIMMICK: I'm in a hurry. You tell us to train these boys, and then you turn around and make them our bosses. And you keep us at the bottom of the ladder. We don't think it's fair. Ladies, I have a lunch. Pardon. Mr. Dimmick, according to the law, you're supposed to post job openings so some of us could apply. Irene, there was only one job opening, and that was for a loan officer. Now, how in the world could I put a woman in as a loan officer? I mean, would you want me to send you out to repossess a car? I would. Irene, you've got to face the facts. What facts? [CHUCKLES] Now, despite what you think, my dear, we are not all equal, you know. [DIMMICK CHUCKLES] I'm not equal? Oh, dear, dear. I tell you. MAN: Hey, here we go. Let's go eat. IRENE: Someone suggested we talk to a lawyer. The next night, we met with John Mack. I love it. This turkey can't open his mouth without putting his foot in it. Okay, we've got one heck of a good case here. One of the few sex discrimination cases where you really have evidence. I mean, it's rare somebody's dumb enough to actually say, "We're not all equal," you know? [WOMEN CHUCKLING] I'm scared. I'm all alone. DONNA FERN: Ellie, so am I. How would you feel if in five or 10 years you were still alone and barely able to pay your rent?WOMAN: Mmm-hmm. Look at me. I have to use food stamps. I don't make enough to feed my kids. JOHN: We'll file a complaint. It'll go up before the EEOC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. They'll investigate. The bank will have to make some changes. Verne Dimmick'll kill me. [MURMURING] Where do we sign? Wait a minute. Why, I've only been here a month. It seems kind of weird to get hired and then turn around and file a complaint. Did they tell you they had one pay standard for men and another one for women? Glennis, some day, you might have a daughter. Do you want it to be that way for her? Okay. Who wants to go ahead? Unanimous! Let's pack this thing up. What do you think Mr. Dimmick's going to do to us? [TYPEWRITER CLACKING] Well, I'm not going to stand for this! JOHN: We have demands here, legitimate demands. Bull! This is what we expect from the people who work at the Midwestern Bank. All employees are expected to give to the bank a degree of loyalty! [CHUCKLING] Wait a minute. Is this is your answer? All personnel are expected to be polite! Polite at all times.Hey. Come on out. I got a surprise for you. JOHN: ...gotta be joking.I can't. I can't leave now. You've got people barely scraping by here,Well, then I'll wait. and you're talking about manners! Either you take this seriously, or we're taking this case to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Oh, good Lord. Are you going to pursue this fool thing? DIMMICK: Now nobody, nobody can accuse me of being unfair to my employees.I've gotta go. Well, I accuse you. I also accuse you of breaking federal law. Look, you had nine or 10 women right here who are qualified for the position of loan officer, who are more experienced than Darryl Lund. They were never even considered. Why? I'll tell you why. Because they were women! Well, I respect women! Ask my wife! I open doors. [WOMEN MURMURING] [SIGHS] GLENNIS: What did you do? My mom, she wanted to surprise you. Check this chair out. [LAUGHS] Huh? This isn't called a sofa, this is a divan. [LAUGHING] Plastic weeds? Well, that's my mom. Wait till you see the bedroom. Got all kinds of drawers. Got a big double bed. She picked out everything. Wallpaper. She got it all here this morning. Must have been a rush job. I thought we were going to paint everything white. And that furniture that we liked. Remember that furniture over at Miller's? You don't like this? Oh, no, no. I like it. Sure, it's nice. We've got a $200 mattress here. You want to try it out? IRENE: John Mack filed charges of sex discrimination with the EEOC, and the meetings with the bank went on and on. JOHN: My clients are forced to hold checking accounts at Midwestern. Their salaries are automatically deposited into these accounts. They never see a paycheck! They don't even listen. We don't have any bargaining power. IRENE: There was only one thing to do. Ask employees at other banks in Willmar to join our fight. IRENE: [ON PHONE] Clara, it's Irene. Oh! I wonder if I could speak to you. What about? If the women at United Bank, if all the tellers and bookkeepers in town got together... Irene, I can't talk now. You're going to get me in trouble. Clara, you have been passed up for promotions for 20 years. You told me yourself. Now, if we join together, we can do something about it. You're starting to sound like a radical. [DIAL TONE DRONING] We'll have to form our own union. Just us. GLENNIS: Ray wrote, "You don't have to join the union." And then she wrote, "What will happen if I don't?" And then he wrote, "You'll get more money than union personnel." Right here. Donna Fern. She's been so quiet lately. She hasn't even been coming to our meetings with Mack. Well, Mack will know what to do with this. Can they try and bribe us or scare us? Well, they can't. I gotta go. We're swamped out there. I'm coming. You know, you better watch yourself. This union business could get you into a lot of trouble. Is that a threat? Just a statement of fact. Wait a minute. Whose side are you on, Donna Fern? I don't understand. I mean, you started all this. You have more to gain than any of us. What's going on? GLENNIS: Ray? Yes, Glennis? I'm worried. Why? Toby's family, they have a real big loan at this bank. Uh-huh. Well, do you think that the bank might recall the loan because of this stuff about forming a union? I don't know. Well, I can't go on like this. What would happen if I stopped? Well, I think if you pulled out of the EEOC complaint and the union business, I think you'd be treated better. TOBY: Call their bluff. My stomach's in knots. Don't worry. They give us any trouble, we'll just go get another bank. Get me a beer, will you? Who was your servant last year? My mom. She spoiled you. Ironed your shorts. Yeah, well you make up for it. You don't iron anything. IRENE: On May 13, 1977, the Willmar Bank Employees Association was certified. Not everybody joined, but we had our union. In August, the bank began to single out union members. They held their annual picnic. None of us were invited. Who cares? I do. I don't know why, but I do. I do, too. [CHUCKLING] Damn it. IRENE: In the winter, the bank changed our hours around, and the women in the union were always stuck with evenings when the drive-up window was open. MAN: You out here again? [WIND HOWLING] My key! My key doesn't seem to work anymore. Drive-up window Saturday. I worked last Saturday. We work late Friday nights, then we have to report first thing Saturday morning. [DONNA FERN LAUGHING] Donna Fern, I'd like to ask you a question. Why not the non-union women? Why don't they ever have to work on a Saturday or a Monday or a Friday night? Why not Darryl? I'm asking you a question. Darryl and I are officers of this bank. If you don't like your job, you should quit. Ray Otteson, you may be vice president of this bank, but I trained you. Beautiful desk, Donna Fern. You always wanted one like the men. Was it worth selling out for? They have no right putting you outside in that drive-up torture chamber after you've been working all day. I'll bring it up at the next meeting. A lot of good that will do. Carrie Marie, may I have a sweet roll, please? What would they do if you walked out? You mean...I mean walk out. Take a hike. Eight women walk off their jobs. Thank you. They won't deal with us. They won't talk to us. You mean, go on strike? Yes. They can't run the bank without you. It would force them to listen. Carry signs? We'd have to picket? I can't afford to. IRENE: We'd have to show them we're not going to take this, and we can fight. And Vern Dimmick would have to sit down and talk to us, wouldn't he? I bet he would. I have to go.Sit down, Glennis. We have pigs farrowing. Big deal. Well, it is a big deal. I've got a life. We all do, Glennis. And kids and husbands. And no husbands and bills. We have to do something. John, isn't there some other way? Do you know what would happen to us in this town? We'd never be able to work again. We'd have to win. Because we're right! We are right. I guess the pigs will have to wait. Okay. [JOHN CLEARS THROAT] Guess what, Dad? Glennis is going to strike against the bank. Bring the chili sauce. You can't win against a bank! Oh, I didn't think we could either, at first, but our lawyer says we can. How about some mustard pickles? He says that if we go out on strike, and then the National Labor Board gets into it, then we'll...Think a government agency's going to dump on a banking institution? Come on! Tell him what you want. Um, just the same salaries as the men. Tell him that part about women who get pregnant. Just that a woman can't be fired for that. For getting pregnant. MR. RASMUSSEN: Where's them pickles? Dad, I was talking to Carl Hanson about that herbicide. Carl Hanson don't know about anything except whistling. Oh, Mr. Rasmussen, my dad researched the variant chemicals. It made a big difference in his yield. Maybe you should talk... [CHUCKLES] TOBY: It was embarrassing! GLENNIS: But we talk, you and me. Besides, you encouraged me. You were asking me all these questions. That's different. You don't interrupt about something that's none of your business! Not with my father and my brother. Well, I do with my father and my brother. That's how I was raised. Do me a favor, Glennis. Just keep your mouth shut in my dad's house! [PHONE RINGING] GLENNIS: Hello? This is Reverend Howell. Toby's family is kind of worried, Glennis. You're leaving your husband alone all the time. They said that? You're not doing your chores. They talked to you about me? They're concerned. Listen to your elders. Settle down, like a good girl. Do everybody a favor and quit that job. I'll think about it. [PHONE HANGS UP] Who was that on the phone? Glenny? You all right? [SIGHS] You know what I've been thinking? We should have a baby. I'm not ready. What's so important? Tobe!Huh? You married to the bank or to me? Toby. [HORN HONKING] IRENE: On December 16, 1977, two weeks before Christmas, we took the biggest step of our lives. We filed charges of unfair labor practices against the bank with the National Labor Relations Board and we went out on strike. It's a dreary, drizzly December day here in Willmar, where we have going on, apparently, the first bank strike in the history of Minnesota. This gentleman behind me is the lawyer who represents these women. Excuse me, sir. Pardon me. Wonder if you could comment for us, please. This is a monumental step for these women. DONNA FERN: Irene. JOHN: Especially at Christmas time. They're all dependent on these incomes. Irene. Irene, don't do this. You run the risk of never getting your jobs back. We'll take that risk. A job is a job! Okay, Irene, don't say I didn't warn you. I hope you've all got money saved. IRENE: We didn't make enough to save. GLENNIS: That's right, Irene! Yeah! Excuse me, ma'am. Care to comment, please?Oh, no. No comment. No. Oh, Mrs. Simmons, please don't cross our picket line. You've gone too far, Irene! Here, let me help you Mrs. Summers. No comment! There you go.Are you sure you won't say something, sir? I said no comment, okay?All right, all right, mister. Fine, thanks DIMMICK: Out of my way, will you?Come on down here, guys. Move over. Let me get by here.WOMAN: I beg your pardon. I don't care what anybody thinks. I'm on Vern Dimmick's side, because he's my friend.Thank you. And you, sir? I wouldn't give an opinion. You wouldn't want to hear it. REPORTER: How about you, sir? You? We're railroad people. Belonged to a union for 40 years. We wouldn't cross a picket line. We're taking our money out of this bank. [WOMAN CHEERING] MAN: Go on! Get this pile of tin out of here, ladies! Go on! Move it. Come on, move it out! Why don't you go home and have some babies? I did that already. Yeah, you're all a bunch of Christian lesbians. What did you say? BOY 1: You heard me. Why are you calling us names? Come on down, baby. Come on over here, baby. Stop that!What's the matter, huh? Hey.Hey, Toby, Toby, don't. BOY 2: Get him! Get him! Get him! Get him! Punch him in the head.GLENNIS: Toby, stop it. You stop it. [CROWD CLAMORING] GLENNIS: Tobe! [CROWD CLAMORING] GLENNIS: Toby!Here, stop that! Stop that! I'm running the picket line, go on. BOY 1: Is that your mommy? Go home with your mommy.BOY 2: Get out! Why don't you all go home!Get out of here. Yeah, go home. What? You cut that out! Get them out of here. Lock them up. Put them in jail. Anything. Cut it out! Go back to work.

They thought if they ignored us, we'd go away. We were isolated, frustrated. Then Terry Caine from the University of Minnesota asked us to come there to speak. None of us had ever spoken in public before. Oh, my crud. Hi. I'm Irene Wallin. I'm happy to be here. I'm happy, but I'm scared. GLENNIS: So it seems like if you have money, you count, and if you don't have money, you don't count. And if you're a woman working at a bank, well, forget it. You might as well throw in the towel. Um, I'm not a political person. When the news was on TV, I'd change the channel. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] IRENE: We see women who should be supporting us going into that bank to work, to do our jobs. Scabs. They don't think enough of themselves to want a fair salary or a promotion or a chance. I'd rather be freezing out on that picket line! We found our voices. Voices we didn't know we had. And we could use those voices to raise money, funds to help us through the strike, because it didn't end in two weeks, or four. Suddenly, outside of Willmar, there was interest in us. News of our strike spread across the country. Magazines and newspapers did stories. Photographers and reporters were all over the place. As people heard about us, they began sending letters to tell us how they felt. Letters from Seattle, to New York, to Provo, Utah. For the first time, we felt like we weren't alone. How many women have trained men? Women who've been on the job for years, suddenly a new guy is hired with no experience, they've trained him, and then he moves on. He enters at more pay, and moves on to be more promoted than the women who helped him enter the company. Are you married, Mrs. Wallin? IRENE: Yes, 21 years. Kids? Three. Housewife, Minnesota? Yes. Probably in the church choir, the whole business? Yeah. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Uh, what union are you now? Welcome to the Willmar Bank Employees' Association, Local One. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You formed your own, then? Yes, we did. As briefly as you know how, what's going on? What's the problem? Well, we want a union contract, the basics. A chance to better ourselves. This is not exclusive to your company, I'm sure. No. It's throughout the banking institution. This has always been a hot subject to handle. The trouble is, no one's had the guts to come out and hit the banking institution, the cornerstone of America. HOST: Thank you, we'll be back... Come on, we're late. You people here. You people here in... You people here in Minneapolis, you may think we're not a union, because we're only eight women. MAN 1: Yeah. Yeah, that's right. MAN 2: Tell it like it is. Well, what difference does it make if we're men or women or green or blue? We're eight people on strike, we need your help! [MAN WHISTLING] MAN 3: Shut up.MAN 4: Shut up. That's what labor unions are all about, right? To attempt to make a life or to help people make a life. [CROWD MURMURING] The reason we're only eight women, is because all the men in the bank were our bosses. [CHEERING] That's more like it! [CROWD CHEERING] [PERSON WHISTLING] We're all coming down to Willmar to march with you. Great. From Local Twenty-One of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union down in Rochester, $600. Thank you. I'm Billy Dimmick. Vern Dimmick's son. Is this a joke?Not really, no. You're uh... You're Vern Dimmick's son? Well, we're a lot alike, actually, just on opposite ends of the pole. I'm a labor organizer. You support us against your dad? I started fighting against my dad in the ninth grade. Irene, I'd like you to meet someone. Billy Dimmick. Vern Dimmick's son. IRENE: Minneapolis is only 100 miles from Willmar, but when Glennis walked into Billy Dimmick's apartment, it was like walking into another world. It was like nothing she had ever seen before. All those books and paintings. And all that knowledge coming out of the walls. We sure could use you as a labor organizer. Me? You've got the touch. Boy, hasn't she? Come on, everybody. Good old Minnesota Cantonese. We have chop suey and egg roll. Oh, I think I just sat on a fortune cookie. [ALL LAUGHING] Unfortune cookie. [ALL LAUGHING] BILLY: Every bank president in this country is going to have his eyes on this strike. For you. Saul Alinsky. "When people cease to participate, "to have a place in the sun, "then all will whither in the darkness of dissidence." Remember that there are more underdogs in this world than there are top dogs. [ROOSTER CROWING] [COWS MOOING] Hi. Fell asleep on the couch. You got a sick cow here. Tobe, they said I had talent as a speaker. They said I should come up to the cities and be a labor organizer. Well, I told them I couldn't, of course. Why don't you? I never see you anyway. Don't be mad. There's just so much happening. You know what this is? Well, I'm up to my neck in it. Tobe, we still got to give her a shot of combiotic, too. Yes, sir. Just do me a favor, go on up to Minneapolis with your big important friends. [WOMEN SHIVERING] IRENE: Willmar loves a parade. Usually they line up three deep on Main Street. Well, we were going to give them one. We were going to show them that we were not just eight people alone. We expected 100 or more volunteers to march with us in weather that was 13 below. This was our day. [HORN HONKING] ♪ Hold the fort, for we are coming ♪ The union makes us strong ♪ Side by side we battle onward ♪ Victory is ours You said you'd come and you did.Yes. Good to see you.I want you to meet the other women. Okay. Okay. Who do we start with?Sylvia, this is Billy Dimmick. Hello, Sylvia. Nice to meet you.This is Charlotte. This is Doris.Doris, how do you do? Hi. Jane, Shirley.Jane, hello. Sandi, Teren.Sandi, hi. Teren. Billy Dimmick.Did everybody wear their long underwear? ALL: Yes!Two pairs. Looks like we've really got a parade! Fantastic. Let's go. Let's get him. Dad won't know what hit him. Where is everybody? [CHURCH BELL CHIMING] IRENE: Then, everybody went home. No more marchers, no more photographers, and no more money. We met at the Willmar Labour Home, a place where we could talk, drink coffee and get warm. Okay, who really needs money? Um... Irene and I are going to need money for traveling expenses. I have a Young Democrats meeting in Minneapolis on Wednesday. Mama, are you a big shot? No. Glennis and Irene are the big shots. Is that why you're all so quiet? Sometimes we feel a little left out. They always ask for you and Irene. We're the ones who'll go. Irene, it's hard. My son's going to have surgery next month. I won't leave him nights. And Teren doesn't want to leave Kurt. And Sylvia doesn't want to rock the boat now that John is back, and Shirley is always busy, and Jane...I don't talk at meetings. Well, then, don't bitch when we do. It gets back to us, Jane. The stuff you say gets back to us.What stuff? Like telling Teren I'm a phony. Well, it's true. What did I do to you? No, I mean in high school, or wherever it was. Tell me and get it out. I honestly don't know. You think you're better than me! Don't push me!You never liked me. I didn't even know you. That's right, you were too busy being the big wheel, like now. Cheerleader and student council. You eat it up! And poor Tobe.What about poor Tobe? He's a nice guy.I know he's a nice guy! You treat him like dirt!Jane! Sit down. Let's just cool it! Glennis, sit down! That's none of your business. Toby and me are none of your business. We're all tired. Worried about money. It's the pressure, that's what it is. The pressure. IRENE: That's right. We just all ruffled our feathers. Now, are we all ready to go on? Uh, about the contributions. I mean, you guys only got $30 last night. Do you want to try? Because I'm sick of it. We go all over the state until all hours of the night, and then you have a fit if we're not on the picket line first thing in the morning. I don't have time to be nice to anybody. We've got to give them more help. On nights they have to speak, they get to take the morning off the picket line. Okay?Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay.Okay. Okay. Okay. Good? [WHISPERING] Thank you. All of these people are watching us. They're sending us their nickels and dimes. We have to stick together. You're right.TEREN: I got a letter from a lady in Fairbanks, Alaska. She said that our courage gave her strength. Tell her it's not courage. Tell her we're just ticked. [ALL LAUGHING] Come on, it's time to hit the picket line. Okay, more coffee? IRENE: It's 30 below out there, so watch the frostbite. Mama, can I have a hot cup of coffee? No, you can't have a hot cup of coffee. I want to picket.Good boy. Thanks, every little bit helps. Snow persons! This is the way to picket. Beautiful. Stop!BOY: I want my snowman! They're not hurting anybody! Come on, that took all day! Don't, you! Don't! Look, lady, I'm just doing my job here. They called in a complaint that this was blocking the view. Big important crime! I'm sorry. I'll... Never mind, I'll do it myself! Big important crime? They killed my snowman! SYLVIA: It's okay, honey. [CRYING] What, are you going to give me tuna fish again? I thought you liked tuna. Not every day, Glennis. Geez. You're in over your head. Careful. Aw, come on, don't cry. I don't cry. [SNIFFLING] Honey, you always cry. You cried during Star Wars. Why don't you just stay home? I just can't do what I'm supposed to do! I try. They're starting a women's softball team over in Clara City. You always liked softball. Why don't you try that? Excuse me. I want to leave. Leave what? I want to find a place of my own. Without me, you mean? For a little while. Oh, Glenny, don't do this. It's like something inside me left, and something else took its place, and I don't fit. Well, maybe if you'd clean up here a little bit, maybe you'd fit better! [CRYING] What's the damned use? I got $200 here. That ought to help you when you try to find your own place. Go ahead. Okay, here. Wait a minute. Let's go. You hardly took anything. Wait a minute. I forgot my plant. I gotta have something growing. Let's get out of here. Let's go. GLENNIS: Slow down. [LAUGHING] SYLVIA: Wait, wait, my finger. Ow! Ow! Ow! Over here.Surprise! Welcome home. You cleaned? Not me. If I want to clean, I'll clean my own house. She worked like a dog here all morning. Come on, let's get this thing out of the way. Where does it go? Oh. Let's put it in the corner there.Okay. Come on, this way.Watch it. GLENNIS: Oh, steady. How we doing? Right?Okay. GLENNIS: Over here. Over here.Okay. Okay. No, no. No, no. A little more that way, girls. [ALL LAUGHING]No, that way. Okay, okay, down. [STAMMERING] That's good. That's perfect. Glenny?Hmm? I could stay with you tonight. No, that's okay. I've got company. This must be your father. Yeah. Oh, no. Oh. Right after this picture was taken, we had this humongous snowball fight. Look at this. God, You were such skinny little kids.First grade. God, I've loved Tobe, ever since I can remember. It's all going to work out. Well, when this is all over and we get back together, we'll be okay. I know that. IRENE: On May 4, 1978, a hearing before the National Labor Relations Board began. The judge was to decide whether or not the bank had actually committed unfair labor practices. If we won, we'd get immediate reinstatement and back pay. If we lost, we'd lose everything. The labor board assigned Robert Sykes to represent us. Judge Garfield flew in from Washington, D.C. to preside. Who were the employees affected by these changes in hours? Just union members. Sylvia Erickson, Glennis Rasmussen, Sandi Treml, Jane Harguth, Shirley Solyntjes and myself. I went to Ray Otteson because... You were having some reservations with yourself about some of the things you had done? Yes.All right. Yeah. What did Otteson say? He said if I dropped the EEOC charges and quit the union business, I'd be treated better. LAWYER: Mr. Otteson, what was your response to Glennis Rasmussen? Well, I assured her that her husband's business wouldn't be affected because Mr. Dimmick is not the kind of person to let this sort of thing interfere with business dealings. Now, Donna Fern, this picnic. Who provided the food and beverages? Ray Otteson brought the meat, I brought the sweet corn. Do you know if the bank paid for any of this picnic? There was no expense check for it. LAWYER: Thank you. Well, Ray Otteson said he was going to have a picnic at his house, and he asked me what I thought about it, and I said, "What are you asking me for? If you want to have a party, that's up to you." It was not a bank affair. Why did they keep harping on that picnic? I understand the complications, sir. Your airline reservation, the fact that Mr. Dimmick is leaving for Switzerland, but these people have been out of work for five months now. More than five months. I don't know how they're going to get through this postponement. IRENE: We heard nothing from the Labor Board that spring. [KIDS CHATTERING] Or in the summer. [STEREO PLAYING SOMETIMES WHEN WE TOUCH] Wait till you see this. The Wonder of Sexbook, illustrated edition. It's full of pictures. Where did you get that? DORIS: Irene, look at this. Oh, I know that one.DORIS: Irene Wallin! [GIGGLING] IRENE: Know that one, too. Oh, come on. What about that one? Uh-huh. GLENNIS: Come on, Irene, how do you know? Don't you ever watch General Hospital? ALL: Irene! Well, don't leave now. You're the only one who understands this book.Irene! JANE: Come back here.I'll tell you more on the picket line. Okay, Irene.Okay. Okay. IRENE: In the fall, Rocky and I put our house up for sale. The day after the sign went up, somebody trashed our yard. [HORN HONKING] Hi. Mom, I can't be in the troop with Dwayne and Todd! Who says? Mrs. Jacobson. It's sticky, Irene. Ray Otteson is the troop leader, and he thinks it would be better if Scott belonged to another group. This is a little boy. There are other groups, like I told Scott. He wants to be with his friends! Now they're starting on our kids. Come on, honey. Come on. I am poison in this town. Everybody thinks I'm the big troublemaker. Who cares what they think? Well, what are we going to do? You know what I heard? Another bank is telling people not to buy our house because it's a bad investment. We'll sell the snowmobiles. That'll help till we sell the house. Remember the day we sprayed the attic with insulation? [BOTH LAUGHING] What a mess. This house is just a shell, Irene. The TV, the snowmobiles, the car, I don't care about none of it. I'll go to the limit for you. Yeah, I better go talk to Scott. After we win, we can put all this behind us. We gotta win, Rocky. I can't get a decision out of the EEOC. I can't get a decision out of the Labor Board. So, there's only one thing to do. Send a formal request to the bank for reinstatement. No!Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hear me out. We take the chance that they might recall one of you back to work. But in the meantime, the rest of you qualify for unemployment benefits. Besides, it will show that we're bargaining in good faith, and that you really do want to go back to work. We have to, Glenny. Nobody's been able to get part-time work. Well, doesn't the Labor Board know we're out here? I mean, look, we've got another winter already! RAY: Hey, Mack. I hear they're going to ask you to resign as chairman of the Kandiyohi Republican Party as a result of this. Oh, really? Geez, that's too bad. Big deal! IRENE: We finally got that settlement from the EEOC, but it was so little that in December we filed for reinstatement at the bank. Doris was the only one they called back. She was demoted from head bookkeeper to teller. Her son was scheduled for open heart surgery in two weeks. I'll see you for lunch. ♪ Silent night ♪ Holy night ♪ All is calm ♪ All is bright IRENE: This was our second Christmas on the picket line, and still no word from the Labor Board. The best present was that Doris's son came through his operation with flying colors. ♪ Holy infant so tender and mild ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace IRENE: For Glennis, it was down to the difference between a can of soup for 23 cents and one for 27. She took the one for 23. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Hey. Toby. I'm glad to see you. Me, too. I'm making some soup. You want some soup? Glenny, I filed for divorce today. Some people like to live alone. I just don't. I want to be with somebody. I don't want to go on like this anymore. I'm lost, Glenny. I can't keep up with you. Tobe. Glenny. [GLENNIS CRYING] Go. This never would have happened if you hadn't gone to work in that bank! Tobe! I got you. I got you.I got you! I got you! White Drug is doing an inventory. Might be some work there. It's filled! I've been thinking about trying to get some full time work. It would break us up, Sandi. Leave six of us on the picket line. Okay, who's in trouble? Who's really short? I'm okay. I'm fine. I'll live. Glenny? I just don't know what I'm going to do. I could give you some. I'm not going to ask you to do that. I want to. Everybody knew when we first went out, this might happen, if we want to stay out for the duration. Take it, Glenny. Next time, it might be me. How much can you spare, Teren? Forty. I'll be fine. And then if anybody else needs a little, and I've still got some left, I'd be glad to. Someday, you'll be able to do it for somebody else. You better believe it. We're going to make it with this thing. One way or the other. [CRYING] Glennis. Jane. They sold... Hey, Glennis, Glennis! Girls! Sandi! Glennis, come here! Hey, Glennis. Come here! Thank God! Come here! Quick! Girls! Come here! Come here. Come here. Come quick, quick! They sold the bank! Did you hear me? Vern Dimmick resigned. Do you hear me? Vern Dimmick resigned.SANDI: Really? Vern Dimmick resigned. [WOMEN CHEERING] The bank has been sold, and Mr. Vern Dimmick has resigned. It seems like he wrote up his own epitaph when he said, "We're not all equal, you know." I can't believe it. We can't believe it. We've known for some time that business was dropping. We've been here every day. Coming and going, we see people. Well, we've heard that the growth rate is down now, compared to other banks in Willmar. Do you think you ladies are responsible? We sure do. There must have been more people on our side in this town than we thought. Seems like the Labor Board'll have to decide in our favor, now! [WOMEN CHEERING] And we couldn't have done it without John Mack. ALL: John, John! I talked to the new president of the bank a few minutes ago. Looks like just a couple more days and you'll all be back to work! [ALL CHEERING] We're going to win! SYLVIA: Doris!TEREN: Doris! Oh, my God.

Just relieved it's over. Come on, Mack. Good job.JANE: Mack, come on! Get in the picture.TEREN: You belong in this. This man never took any money for himself. John! John, what is it? What's the matter? We lost.What? We lost. A reporter just called. The judge ruled against us. Hey, come on. Please! How? How could that happen? Would you please stop that? Technicalities. The way I worded a telegram. My failure to bring up your change in hours at a bargaining session. A six-month period elapsed. [SOBS] Technical mistakes. [SCREAMING] No! Glennis, Glennis, hold on! Hold on.I can't! IRENE: We have to hold on. It's all we've got, each other. [CAMERA SHUTTER SNAPPING] Hold on. IRENE: The bank had won. The judge found that the bank had committed unfair labor practices, but they were not the cause of the strike. The only charge that held up was the failure of the bank to invite union employees to the annual picnic. Cut. The bank was ordered to post a notice for 60 days promising not to discriminate against union employees in the future. There would be no back pay, no reinstatement. The strike was over. Everyone always asks, "Whatever happened to the Willmar 8?" Well, a documentary was made about us, and we decided to show it one night at the Willmar movie house. Could somebody turn on a light, please? IRENE: We expected a handful of supporters, but the place was packed. People were standing in the back. Some of them left, but most stayed. MAN: Excuse me. I'd like to say something. Yes, Clara. I got my promotion. After 22 years, and I'm finally bank manager, because you women. You got it for me. [AUDIENCE CLAPPING] Me and my friends. We used to make fun of all you women. Every day, crack jokes. But we didn't know what this was all about. I'm sorry. I'm just terribly, terribly sorry. [AUDIENCE CLAPPING] What are you doing now? How are you getting along? I manage an optical store. And Teren is a bookkeeper with a manufacturing firm. And Sylvia is a part-time nurse. I'm a representative for a home decorating company. I'm still at the bank. And still a teller. I'm at the Minnesota Department of Economic Security. And Jane, here, got married. [AUDIENCE CLAPPING] I still work. I do the books at Johnson's Variety. And Glennis is moving to Minneapolis. She's going to be a labor organizer! [AUDIENCE CHEERING] And, um, I have to go. I have to get up at 6:00 in the morning, so goodbye.

We didn't lose. Since our strike, women in the banking industry have won higher pay and promotions and the dignity that comes from standing up for their rights. The Willmar 8 didn't lose. We won.
