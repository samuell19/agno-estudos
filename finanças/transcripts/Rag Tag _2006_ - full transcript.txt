[snort] [door closes] Put them like they were. And don’t be late for school again. Good morning, Tag. Jammed again, Rag. I just opened the flat for your people. Mum? Mum. Raymond-- Rag. Hi. I’m Nadia Davids, and this is Ian Wolfson, my colleague. We’re from the Barnet Family and Children Team. Social workers. Rag, when was the last time you saw your mother? Who called you? Someone who cares about you was concerned you’re not being looked after properly. I’m fine. You don’t need to be here. Rag, where is your mother? She leaves me money and stuff. I can take care of myself. You’re only 12 years old. It ain’t her fault. She don’t know where she is half the time. She’s never done nothing dangerous. Leaving you on your own is dangerous. I got people. I’m okay here. Please don’t take me away. Please. Please. Please. So this is your great escape plan? Just let me think, all right? Did they say who called them? Why Birmingham? They’re placing me with my dad’s mum. She’s family. At least you’ll be safe. I’m safe here, ain’t I? With you and your parents. They won’t let you stay with us. Then I’ll run away and come back on my own. You’ll end up like one of those boys at King’s Cross, doing all sorts just for food or drugs. You’ve been watching too many of them educational programs, Tag. Promise you’ll stay with your gran until you’re old enough to come back. Bet she don’t even want me. Please, Rag. You can’t. I didn’t even know it could come off. It will keep you safe until you’re old enough to come back. And if it comes to the worst of it, you can flog it. It’s worth a bob or two. ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ It’s the rapper boy ♪ ♪ Nothing between us ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ Yeah? ♪ Yeah, yo ♪ ♪ The dim lights ♪ ♪ Reflect the wet... ♪ Take care, all right?

"Dear Mr. Olu, Smith and Klein Associates appreciate the time you took to come for the interview on Thursday. Unfortunately, we’re not able to offer you a position at this time." What? Racist, fascist, Swatstika-sucking wankers. That’s a bit harsh. Says who? They should be begging you to work in their sad excuse for chambers. Did you hear her language? These Oyibo girls make very disrespectful wives. Your son is not going to marry her. How do you know? Are you ever around to see what is happening? He won’t marry her because he knows you don’t like her. Simple. As long as I get Simmons Reese, the rest can send as many rejection letters as they want. When’s that interview? End of the month. You decided who gets you yet? I don’t understand how everyone is so sorted, even my layabout siblings. [phone rings] Hello. Olisa! [speaking native language] Speaking of oppressed people, have you seen who’s running for council this year? Not a clue of their constituency. Only one of them’s actually been out and about. [Mother] Olisa calling from America! Talk later, yeah? Still in America? [Olisa] Don’t worry. I’ll reach London in time for the Nigeria trip. Congrats! Rachel said you smashed your bar exam. It’s no big deal. Look at this boy. The highest result-- no big deal? Isn’t helping me get a job. Why do you want to work for those people? You suffer and you die in that country. When you reach Naija, you’re going to see-- [doorbell rings] Olisa, can you hold on small? [Mother] We’re leaving in ten minutes, all. Who is that? My friend. From law school? Eh? Didn’t think you’d be at the same house. Can’t believe. You’re in law school. Was half afraid you’d be a priest or something and forget me. I got some A levels myself. Did all right in them, but, you know... When did you get in? This morning. Got this solid flat just on top of the station. You’re staying, then? It depends. I’ve paid for the first month, but I need a job to cover anything after that. What type of job? How are you gonna-- Anything respectable. My qualifications don’t get nothing fancy. Then why don’t you want your parents to see me? It’s just been a while, you know? Come ’round tomorrow for Sunday lunch. Give me some time to prepare them. Yeah, don’t forget to mention my criminal record. Murder, pillage, crimes against fashion? Yeah. Usual stuff. Thought as much. How are you so sure I don’t have a criminal record anyway? My Rag’s too smart for that. Tomorrow? [no audible dialogue] [no audible dialogue] [no audible dialogue] [police radio chatter] [Man] Come back here! [shouting] You thought I’d let you have it, mate! Oi! What the fuck do you think you’re doing, eh? Ron! It’s all right, mate. Get the fuck out of here! Calm down, mate. Calm the fuck down. All right? It’s all right. It’s all right. Come on, man. Thanks a lot, man. I knew it. Rag? Xin, bro. We went to primary school together. I saw you move in this morning. Bringing your screwups to me station. What you thinking, boy? It wasn’t my fault. Can’t reason with some people. Thanks for stepping in. If it weren’t for Mum and Dad, I’d let him take the hiding. Yeah, man, thanks. Thanks a lot, man. Hey, Wing, don’t you remember Rag? We used to go to primary school together. Wing! Wing, what, aren’t you gonna offer us a drink? Wing! I don’t normally do hardware, but Ron and Ed were offering ready cash. You don’t mess people like them about. I didn’t, honest. Look, I got some hand-helds from America, and I told them to use a transformer to charge them. Dumbos went and plugged them straight in. Of course they blew. From now on, I’m sticking to programming. Xin thinks he’s going to invent the next Google and become Prime Minister. Got no respect for the revolutionary spirit. The rest of us do real work, twinkle toes. I see you’re considering the brigade. Noblest profession. Dad used to say that. Firefighter? He was. Dead now. [cough] Oi, I remember! He got hit by a van or something, isn’t it? I’m really sorry. You’re used to his tact. Ages ago. I was 8. Want to follow in his footsteps, though? I can’t pass half these things. Then why are you still holding on to the application form? [door closes] Mummy, Daddy, you remember my friend Rag. Hello, Pa Tagbo. Ma Tagbo. Angus? You said they last forever. Only if you really care for them. Mum helped. I missed her. She missed you. We all did. Yeah. Not enough to come and get me. I was 12. Well, you ain’t 12 no more, you get me? If you hadn’t come, I would have. Yeah? When? I find a job. I find somewhere to live. I find you. Well, I saved you the bother. You can have this back. I don’t want it back. Don’t you believe anymore? Of course I believe. It kept you safe. Brought you back. [door closes] So, what have you really been up to for the last ten years? Hi. I’m Olivia. Pleased to meet you, Olivia. I’m Raymond, but everyone calls me-- Rag. You’ve met Olivia. This isn’t Tag’s best friend from when he was little? When did you get here? He moved back this weekend. Weren’t we supposed to meet later? I thought you could use the moral support. How did it go? I didn’t think I fit the profile Ashcroft and Partners are looking for. From what we’ve seen, you’re better off. Poor baby. Yeah, got a good deal on it, In spite of the madman next door. Kitchen, bathroom, small room, living room... master bedroom. It’s bigger than Xin’s. You could get a flat mate. You could move in. I don’t have any money. We’ll manage. You don’t even know how you’re paying next month’s rent. So you’re moving in with Olivia, then? Did I say that? Didn’t say you had a girlfriend, either. It never came up. Whatever. Okay. Where’s your mum? What’s that got to do with anything? Since we’re talking about things we haven’t mentioned. She isn’t worth mentioning. She’s family. All the family I have are in Birmingham and here. Or at least I thought so. She might still be around. I didn’t mean her. Aren’t you supposed to be meeting your girlfriend? Not for a while yet. Yeah, well, I’ve got stuff to sort out. [Woman] Good afternoon. Barnet Council. Hi, love. How are you doing, sweetheart? Great. I’m going to need a favor. God knows I owe you a few. What’s up? I know this isn’t strictly allowed, but could you look someone up for me? What’s this? I’ve decided we should officially join the party and help with canvassing. Great idea. For you. We could do it together. It’s the perfect start if we want to change laws some day. All this revolution stuff has always been more you and Xin’s thing. This "revolution stuff" is about everyone having a franchise. We don’t have to do everything together. In fact, maybe... we could do with some time apart? Are you breaking up with me? Olivia, perhaps... maybe... if we just-- Come on, just spit it out. Why have I got to work so bloody hard to get anything out of you? If you’re tired of me, I deserve at least-- Okay, fine. Space would do us good. Help us figure out what’s best for both of us. And it’s not necessarily the same. We all have to, mate. Prepare for battle. [video game noises] No one lock their doors around here? Ain’t hiding from no one. She lives off Brent Street. [video game stops] We still going to Wing Tat’s? I’m gonna go and get my shaving kit. I know. You know? I get into buildings. A filing cabinet ain’t hardly gonna be a problem. Then you know how sick she is, too. Have you been to see her? She never came to see me. Maybe she thought you didn’t want her to. Maybe she’s right. She’s dying, Rag. You should go and see her. Because you say so? Because you wouldn’t have come back if you still didn’t care. Ten years, and you still think you’re the expert on how I feel? I know when you’re hurting. And seeing her will fix everything? Don’t touch me. I told you to fucking leave it. Hey, man, we don’t have to go to Wing Tat’s today. I was just leaving anyway. You have a real talent. She’s not usually so quiet. Who’s Daddy’s little angel? Mei Ling, that’s who. Gwai loyu. Gwai loyu. What did he say to her? Lord knows. Hmm. Even after being married to my brother for 15 years, Heather still thinks it wrong for black people to speak Chinese. Your mum been married to a Chinaman for nearly 40 years, and she don’t speak it. Anyway, I get what I need to. Fine. But I haven’t forgotten the Igbo curses that Tag taught us. Do you remember them? Don’t you dare, not in front of Leung. It’s not as if he can hear. He’s upstairs. How you know? It’s bad enough he has so many Nigerians at his school. They aren’t going to corrupt him in his own home, either. What do you mean, corrupt him? Careful, Heather. Rag has strong ties with our African brothers. Look, I got a class to teach. Gonna see you guys later. Those Nigerians aren’t like us. It doesn’t make them bad people. They’re always on look for an angle. Charm you into doing anything. I don’t want my son growing up thinking life is all about what you can get out of people. Yeah, but some of them are good, you know-- go out of their way to help others when they know no one appreciates it. You show me a good Nigerian, and I’ll show you the people he bribed to deceive you. Don’t bother arguing with her. Heather thinks the Chinese are evil, too. Didn’t stop her from marrying me, though. We could cover some of West Hendon tomorrow. Should be good for a few votes. Look, it’ll pass. He’s just on the Rag. Sorry? That’s what we used to say when him and Rag got into one of their massive fights at school. Thought we were so clever back then. How do you get him out of it? You can’t. Only Rag gets him this wounded up, so it’s only Rag that can undo it. Normally an apology, and hey presto-- friends forever again. And if Rag doesn’t apologize? Trust me. He always does. It’s always his fault anyway. Speak of the devil. Look, I’m sorry I went off on you like that earlier. I shouldn’t have tried-- No. You were right. I told you. Friends forever again, like the last ten years didn’t even mean a thing. Let’s go. His parents aren’t touchy-feely, either. It’s the way he was brought up. Reckon this new look will improve my job prospects? [Tag] No chance. [Rag, Tag chuckle] You’ll be all right. She’s probably not even in. Do you want me to come with you? [Woman] Tell them I don’t want nothing, Debbie! You all right, Sylvia? Same time tomorrow, then. [coughing] [match striking] Dirty habit. [coughing] Why you not sit down? You’re just your father. Glad you’re still with your boy. How your parents, Tag? Your mother still nursing, then? [coughing] You boys want tea or something? I’m okay, thanks. Rag? You’re just like him. He always the one who’s strong. He take care of all of us. What I know of looking after pikney? I can’t even look after myself. [coughing] Them tell me him with him father’ mother. She hard, but I know she make sure he eat, dress clean, stay for school. [coughing] [coughing] Bloody hell. What did you say he does? Olisa’s a businessman. Half the houses on this street belong to Nigerians. There’s a lot of money back home. What sort of business? Import-export. He travels around a lot. What exactly does he import and export? Not drugs. Tag! You must be Rag. Tag has been talking nonstop about you. Welcome. Come in, come in. You’re welcome. Look at this guy. He just passed his degree. [general chatter] You meet us well. Shebi, you go chop? Are you sure your friend can manage these strange dishes? Like I don’t know a good thing. Pass me the Egwusi soup. Aha. That’s what I like to hear. Now come on, come on. I want to talk with you. Can you believe this girl? She’s not even coming to Nigeria. Why would she be going to Nigeria? Because he’s not going, and he wants me to come in his place. Why aren’t you going? I’ve got some urgent business in Switzerland. I will try and meet you up. Anyway, Ikeora will take care of you. And Rachel. I told you I can’t do it. I’ve got other plans. Ikeora’s gonna have to do it. So I’ve got to go on my own? Come on, Rachel. I’m not in the mood to go to Nigeria and see all those sycophants singing to him just because he’s scattered his dirty money all over the place. Is it not the same dirty money that has been paying for your school fees, your car, your house? Or is it not dirty when you are going to Gucci and Prada or stay in hotels with your hungry Yoruba boyfriend? Well, if it’s like that, collect. She does not understand. Mama and Papa will not rest if she marries a Yoruba. They are not like us. Oh. But they’re all right for your 419 or when it comes to having fun. If it’s like that, why don’t you go to the dining table and chase them away? So why did your mother name you after a dirty towel? They actually named me Raymond, but everyone’s called me Rag since I was little. Amaka, how can you talk when you Igbo people always have funny names anyway? What exactly does Tagbo mean? Tagbo means... "Today is in good time." You shouldn’t bother learning Igbo. Most people speak Hausa. A pre-party is not a party without a fight. Now I’m ready for the club. You drive? Which one do you want to take? The BM or the Porsche? Which one should we take? No. Uh, Tag will accompany Rachel in the Porsche. I’m sure Ruqaya and the others will accompany you.

What? For your visa. Where am I, even? [chuckling] My house. You were so drunk last night, and Tag didn’t think you’d manage the stairs in your own house. Anyway, you said you wanted to come to Nigeria for the chieftaincy. Huh? Uh, I was off my head last night. I’m sorry. It’s nice of you, but I can’t really afford-- Don’t worry. I will take care of everything. You’re my guest. All you need to do is bring your passport. You have a passport now? Nan took us to Jamaica once. Good. That makes things easier. Otherwise, I can get one for you. What time is it? After 1. Oh, shit. Hello, Keisha. I’m sorry I didn’t call earlier. How did Tatty do at the dentist? She was fine. What happened? Things got a bit barmy. I’m going to Nigeria for the weekend. You haven’t got money to pay for Tatty’s day care, but you’re flying to Africa for the weekend. Are you thieving again? Look, I’ll get the money to you by the weekend for Tatty. Can I speak to her now, please? Daddy. How’s my little coco pop? Mummy says you were really brave at the dentist. I have 20 teeth. He even gave me a lollipop. Only take your newest caftans. You know everyone will be looking at you to see if we are suffering in London. And don’t forget to greet everybody. Even if you greeted them in the morning, greet them again in the afternoon and before they go to sleep or they will say we gave you no home training. Tell Jide-- Tell him that I said that-- You’re almost done packing, then? How did you get in here? Civilized people use the doorbell. The next time you do this-- [phone rings] [ring] [ring] What did I ever do to him? I’m sorry about last night. Everyone gets pissed once in a while. I didn’t mean that. I’m sorry about that, too. There’s been a lot to sort out this week. Finding you... and Mum. These feelings. I just need to get my head ’round things, you get me? I’m not sure if I do. Aren’t you? You packed for Nigeria, then? Get your Jamaican ass vaccinated, just in case. Don’t forget to stock up on anti-malarials, insect repellent. Get copies of your passport if I were you... Oh, shit. Passport. I’ve got to go. [knocking] [thumping] Why you knocking on the door like I owe you money? Sorry bout that, bro. Look, I need some details from you. Hello, boys. What the fuck? How did you get in? Window was open. Yeah, but we’re on the fifth floor. [Rag] Ah-ah. I’ve got something of yours. Anyway, this is a business call. You guys exchange goods for cash? You must be joking. After what you did? Ed, shut up. Depends what you got. Bought them all in the last year. I’ll give you 50 for the lot. Ron, you’re not gonna do business-- Just fucking shut it! You’re bloody right he’s not. Especially when I paid 400. Seeing as you went to all the trouble of coming here, I’ll give you 75. 300. 100. All right, I’ll give you 200. Ed, go and get the man his money. But I’m being generous because I see potential. I mean look, with your skills in the breaking in department-- I didn’t break in. The window was open, and you know me. The law says I’m a visitor. In that case, I know some ripe houses just begging to be visited. ’Round the corner from here-- Bishop’s Avenue. You see, there’s a bunch of rich Nigerians have their holiday homes. Well, the private security’s a joke. The guards don’t turn up till dark and leave first thing in the morning. The cheapskates don’t bother wiring upstairs windows. Come on, mate. I mean... this is peanuts compared to what a nimble bloke like yourself could make in partnership with us. A low-risk grand a week. What do you say? Pleasure doing business with you. Call me.

They’re not gonna make me do anything. This trip, it’s amazing. The way they live here and London and everything. I know how tempting it can be. [Tag] This is cool.

Stop trying to be such a hard man. I mean it. You got gentle hands. You should have been a doctor. You always said you’d be a fireman or a botanist. Why didn’t that happen? Why did you choose law?

It’s all right, Leung. Maybe another time, eh? [Leung] Sei bat por. What did you call me? Get back here now. Rag? What she said about us. People will say and do a lot worse. You do know that? Yeah, but-- But what? I don’t really care about her. Not if I get to be with you. But we ain’t together. We ain’t done nothing since Nigeria. We haven’t done anything. Yeah, this is really the fucking time to be correcting my grammar. If sounding like a poor man’s version of you will help me get an answer, then fine. What exactly are you waiting for? The world to be a better place? Even if I had a house like Olivia’s and a fancy job, I still wouldn’t be good enough to take home to Daddy. Rag, that’s not what I was-- Fuck it! I’m sorry about... Come in. Look, I know you need more time, but-- [footsteps] What is it? It’s your mum, Rag. She went into hospital this morning with breathing problems. Her instructions were that if anything happened, she didn’t want artificial intervention. Her lungs collapsed an hour ago. Dead? Please accept my sympathy. Thank you. We didn’t think anyone cared enough to come to the funeral. Your mother made a new family. She certainly didn’t care about her old one. The cancer didn’t punish her enough? When you become somebody’s mother or father, you don’t automatically become the perfect person to take care of them their whole life. Sometimes real love is allowing someone else to give what we can’t... no matter how much it pains. [no audible dialogue] Sorry. Hi. Rag. Was hoping your nan would make it. She wasn’t Mother’s biggest fan. She told Dad she would try and get a flight. Seems they had a good chat. Yeah, well-- Daddy. Tatty. Keisha, what are you doing here? Tag’s dad sent us train tickets. He thought you might need the support. You must be Tag? Pleased to meet you, uh-- Keisha. Tatty-- Tattiana’s mum. Tatty, say hello to Tag. You want tea? Let’s get baby some cake. Excuse me. I’m sure you and Keisha have a lot of catching up to do. [Keisha] How was I supposed to know you hadn’t told him? Had enough space? You could say that. I don’t know what’s gotten into you, but I like it. My parents will be gone for hours. We’ll have the place to ourselves. You really should use the doorbell. Why are you in bed with her? She is my girlfriend, after all. Were you expecting me to sit here twiddling my thumbs while you were out with Keisha? I was going to tell you. Before or after you screwed me? Before or after I told the man who raised me to fuck off and moved in with you? It weren’t like that. They’ve gone back to Birmingham. That’s where they live. Abandoning children runs in the family. Fuck you! I get Tatty for holidays. The small room’s hers. I speak to her every day. Look, Keisha knows I came back here for you. Tatty’s the only thing between us, I swear. Me and Keisha, we went out for a bit during A levels. Just before the results, she tells me that she’s pregnant. She’s staying in Birmingham keeping the baby. I was going back to Jamaica. We didn’t have money. I was hustling. Why didn’t you tell me all this before? Did you stop to consider how I’d feel-- Did you stop to consider how I’d feel? You’re in bed with your girlfriend. Yeah, I don’t always get it right, but you know how I feel about you. You know. What are you doing? I have to speak to him. [sigh] Let me help you.

Because I spent all afternoon looking for you. About before, I shouldn’t have-- We can talk after the interview. But the reason why-- I’m here to make sure you get some sleep. I’m sorry. Me, too. He was in Tagbo’s bed. And so? Don’t interfere again. You saw what happened to him the last time. I don’t regret it. How can you say that? Don’t you want our son to progress? He could achieve so much, make us so proud. Proud of who? [Ma Tagbo] Proud of you, of course. Look at my son, eh? Guy guy for road, no money for pockets. After today, his pockets will be full. I haven’t got the job yet. Besides, chambers aren’t exactly clamoring to employ me. They weren’t the ones you wanted. God has guarded this one for you. Bound all enemies in the name of Jesus. Amen! I got a good feeling about this. Me, too. But why Simmons Reese? Well for one thing, Mrs. Reese, you handle more legal-aid cases in Family Law than any other chambers of similar standing. Secondly, you’re interested in making waves, not just drifting on the legislative tide. What gave you that impression? In dealing with many of your child neglect disputes, Mr. Brefalt, you have argued a strong case for cultural sensitivity. For example, the case of the Nigerian mother who washes her children with a bucket. By talking to her children you showed her actions were based on harmless traditions. The first not only taught them not to waste water, but kept them as clean as any shower. Your knowledge of our cases is impressive. But bearing in mind we often work with single mothers abandoned by young black men, like yourself, do you think they’d feel comfortable dealing with you? I think single parent families feel let down by lots of people, Miss Chatterjee. Each individual has to prove himself or herself. Perhaps in helping them sort out what’s best for them and their children, I might even restore their faith in young black men like myself. I see you graduated with a first class in your Law and Social Policy degree. Dinners at the Inns must have been a huge change from all that swotting. [chattering] One second. Is anything the matter, Philip? There’s a young man been loitering out here for an hour or so. Him? I think security should be informed. He’s not bothering anyone. Not yet. But what is he doing there? Perhaps he’s waiting for another young black man around the same age? You think there may be more than one? Rag! Me. We’re together. He’s been waiting for you? I know it’s hard for you to believe, but not every young black man is out to rape your women, steal everything mobile, and vandalize what they can’t take with them. That’s absolutely uncalled for. It’s completely called for. Gentlemen, please. Philip, this is Mr. Tagbo Olu, whom we just interviewed. And this, I think we’ve established, is Rag? Rag, Mr. Olu, my partner, Mr. Philip Simmons. As in-- Simmons of Simmons Reese. I’m sure you’ll appreciate the sensitivity of our work, and Philip is... vigilant about security. In fact, he had my nieces interrogated the first time they came here to meet me for lunch. If you’d left their names at reception, that wouldn’t have been necessary, Sophie. Ah. Well, you can’t be too careful. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go and change. I can’t go to court without my KKK uniform, can I? Well, it’s been an interesting morning. You’ll hear from us in a day or two. See what I mean? What are you on about? People look at you and see this amazing person. If there’s any justice, you’ll have a great job, great family, great life. People look at me, they dial 999. No education, no prospects. You’re doomed by association. What about the fire brigade? I would have heard by now. You’ve got University and Botany and-- It’s not happening. Not here. We’ll find something. No, we won’t. I’m going back to Birmingham tomorrow. Back to Keisha? No, away from you. I’m not dragging you down with me. Mum’s gone. My money’s gone. It’s time I went, too. You can’t leave me again. We’re not together now. Not really. Goodbye, Tag. Olisa? My man.How now? How much do I get if I do it? 100,000, cash. As soon as you make the transaction. Today? Why not? The bank closes at 5. I prepared the passport and paperwork for you when you went to Nigeria. You were that sure I was gonna do it? I have faith in you. Are you coming? See you in 30 minutes.

Come in. Where you been, man? Wing told me to give that to you personally. No fucking way. Yeah. Said that they only took four out of 20 of you, and you did the best. You taking a piss. Not gonna show any mercy toward you when you start training next week. It’s not gonna be that bad. I’m going back to Birmingham. But what about Tag? You can’t just give up on him like that. You gave up on Olivia. I guess some things, you know, ain’t meant to be. Says who? Look at my parents. Jamaican girl, Chinese boy. You wouldn’t believe the grief we got when we were growing up. And look, 35 years down the line, they’re still besotted with each other. We turned out all right, didn’t we? Shut it. I Guess there’s hope for you and Olivia yet. She’s a good woman, you know. I wouldn’t hang about too long. Hi. Is Tag in? I heard your party won. Congratulations. Yeah. Thanks. You don’t know what time he’ll be back, do you? You want to enter and wait? I wouldn’t want to be any trouble-- Let me "on" the kettle. [knock on door] I’ve got to go, coco pop. Someone’s at the door. I’ll see you tomorrow. Love you. Bye. He and Rag are so adorable. I’m sure you want to have many children. I never really thought about it. My son would make an excellent father, don’t you think? Time isn’t on my side anymore. Tell me you didn’t. I couldn’t go through with it. No harm done, then. It’s not that simple. Is Olisa threatening you? Because if he is-- No, no. I spoke to Rachel when I couldn’t reach him. Olisa left England this afternoon. He’s got copies of the fake passport he made stashed away in his place. When the police raid it, I’m going down, too. Yeah, but you didn’t do anything. They can put me away for intent. Not before I’ve done this. If you were to fall pregnant... Mr. Olu, this is inappropriate. You and me want the same thing. I want Tag to be happy. I want to be with someone who looks at me the same way that he looks at Rag.

I called you at 6 a.m., and you came. I could get charged with obstruction of justice. I have a promising political career ahead of me. Look, any sign of trouble, you call me on Tag’s mobile. Get in the car and drive away. Nothing else connects us. Even if I can get Mum’s car, who’s gonna be the getaway driver? [Ron] ’Round the corner from here-- Bishop’s Avenue. You see, there’s a bunch of rich Nigerians have their holiday homes. Well, the private security’s a joke. The guards don’t turn up till dark and leave first thing in the morning. The cheapskates don’t bother wiring upstairs windows. [no audible dialogue] [doorbell rings] Hi. We’ve just recently won the election, and we know that there are some problems in the area, and we were just wondering if you had any particular requests or questions about, uh... Rag? Olisa has some documents-- well, me and Tag think he does-- stuff that could get Tag into trouble. I didn’t come here for the money. If they’re-- Olisa called this morning. He asked me to destroy them before the police come. Nothing else ties Tag to any of this? He doesn’t want Tag entering into trouble. I thought you said Olisa deserved what was coming. Good or bad, he’s still my brother. What happened? Mission accomplished. You know, I do feel like going out tonight, Xin. Maybe we should just make it the two of us though, hmm? [Pa Tagbo] I don’t know where he was. I went up to check on him last night, and... I checked at 3:00. He was not there. I went to check at 3.30-- still not there. I don’t know what the hell he thinks he’s playing at. He’s not too old for me to put him out the house or put him over my knee. He needs to see some discipline. I don’t know what he’s doing. I don’t know where he’s been hanging around. I know who he’s been hanging around with, and I must put my foot down. He’s running around with Rag, and I’m not liking it. I tell you, I must put an action. Where were you last night? I stayed over at Rag’s. And you couldn’t call your father? I’m sorry. Sorry for yourself. Your interview people. Eh-heh? "Dear Mr. Olu, Thank you for your interest in Simmons Reese. My colleagues and I found your answers insightful, and Mr. Simmons especially thought you showed great passion in your defense. Thus, it is our pleasure to offer you a position." Praise God! Hallelujah! Where are you going now? I’m moving in with Rag. It makes more sense, especially now I’ve got a job. I shouldn’t still be living at home... Leviticus chapter 20 verse 13-- And if man also lie with mankind, as with a woman, then both of them have committed an abomination and are condemned to death. Obasi! It is in the Bible, pomp and plain. So we’re gonna do this? Want to hide behind the Bible? Fine. Leviticus chapter 25 verse 37-- Do not charge interest on a loan. Leviticus chapter 19 verse 19-- Do not wear clothes with mixed fiber. Verse 23-- Do not eat fruit from a young tree. Verse 27-- Do not cut your hair. Leviticus says we are all going to hell, Daddy. Genesis 19-- God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah for your sin. Not according to Matthew 25 verse 35 or the whole of Isiah chapter 1. In fact, if you want a concise version, read Ezekiel 16:49-50. How does it go again? Now this was the sin of Sodom-- they were arrogant, overfed, and unconcerned. They did not help the poor and needy. They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them. You think you can use your law school tricks to confuse God? Sin is sin. And love is love. Ifeyinwa, you are not siding him. Whether I agree or not, he is still my son. Take care of Angus for me. You’re not going anywhere. Gonna call Social Services again? Olivia had a chat with him last night. He’s the one that called them. I told myself you wouldn’t sink that low. You were too close. We were 12. We never knew we could do anything about this. But you knew, didn’t you? You saw what happened with Edozie and Jide. You still haven’t forgiven your own twin brother. I got the documents from Olisa’s house. You’re mad. What if they could-- They didn’t. Hurry up packing so we can go home. I’m suddenly not in the mood for packing anymore. What’s this? A job. The job. So now I’m not going to jail. We don’t have to starve, either. Wouldn’t anyway. I got the job, too. I knew it. They’re so lucky to have you. God, I love you. [singsong] Rag loves Tag. Rag loves Tag. Rag loves-- Not in this house! You’ll soon have it to yourself anyway. Tagbo, wait now. Jide made the greatest mistake of his life. He will die a poor man in the village. Do you know Uncle laughs more than you? He’s happy with his decisions. If I follow yours, I will die miserable. It is not just my decision. This is the worst thing you can do to him. Do you want him to surrender everything-- his hopes, his beliefs, his ambitions? He is my ambition. Everything I’ve ever wanted leads back to him. I love him. What does it profit a man if he gains the world but loses his own soul? Do you really want me to walk away from mine? What? I was just wondering, like, if you think it’s okay and you don’t mind and Keisha doesn’t mind, I would really like to meet Tatty. You know, properly. That’s brilliant. Great. When? Now? Go to Birmingham now? What’s stopping us? Nothing.
