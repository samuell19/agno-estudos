Calm down! Settle down! And that outfit... -Look how short your skirt is! -Yeah, yeah. "Yeah, yeah" yourself! Yeah, yeah. Have fun. Remember your mother. OK? Don't talk to just anyone! You're really cute... Come on, suck me! -What are you doing? -Sucking you. No, suck my dick! What? I can't do that. I'm Jewish! You're adorable! No, stop! My father will kill me! Don't worry. I didn't finish inside. You can still get married. Yeah, but... you left a trail in my Sunday tights. You dripped snot all over me! The blonde Kabyle there is my father. I've never met him. And the stain on her thigh is how I was born. On Christmas of '69, he got my Jewish mom pregnant without penetrating her. With a beur dad and a Jewish virgin mom who was pregnant at Christmas, is it any surprise I believed I was the Jewish Jesus? -Come on! -How are you? I don't have time. -Come on! -I don't have time! This is my neighborhood, the Cité des 4,000. This is where they put the pieds-noirs, the Arabs, the Jews, the Italians, and the Portuguese when they rebuilt France. We were just fine, living on top of each other. This is where I grew up and where I became someone. Seriously, Hakima! Can't you pee at home? There was a line, and I couldn't hold it. When is your mother going to stop making babies? Get out of here! Thank you, Fifi! A FILM BY SYLVIA OHAYON -Hello? -Mrs. Micheline Mortier? No. I mean... sure, why not. Your father, Mr. Bismuth, has just died. Thank you. Stéphou? What are you doing? Help me! Gramps is dead. What? Gramps is dead. My dad... It will be OK, Mom. I'm here. My grandfather was the family patriarch. The only time he ever cried was when my mother came home pregnant. But he made sure my mom and I lacked for nothing... in secret. How do I know that? Because my grandmother told me. I was raised by my grandparents, Moïse and Margot Bismuth. I had five fathers: my uncles. Margot said it didn't matter that I didn't have a father. When my mother got pregnant, they hid her away in the psych ward at Saint-Anne. The day she left the madhouse, she became weird. That's Christian, my stepfather. He married my mother when I was six. He hits me a lot. My mom doesn't stop him. All she cares about is dancing to Boney M. Mrs. Bismuth, you must sit on the floor, for seven days. It's Moses' law. Moses? The only Moses I know was my husband, and he is dead. Grandma... What? Hey, how are you? Mom, you're making a mess! Who cares? You'll clean it up. Why aren't you coming to Gramps' funeral? I don't feel like it. He's dead. He won't know. Did you find your car keys? No, maybe they're in your bag. You still have that, huh? France has some great singers, you know! How's it going, Jew? Poor guy. You just made six million enemies in two seconds. You're fucked, in this world and the next. That's enough, you two! Stéphanie, don't talk back to your father. -He's not my father! -Yes, I am! I recognized you, you floozy! That's enough out of you two! I have a father to put in a basket! A casket, Mom! You're such an idiot. -Don't talk to your mom like that! -Stop it! Hey, enough! Stop it! Who is it? It's Stéphanie. Hello. Fatima invited me. Are you Francis' niece? Oh, you're the poor girl whose grandfather... My condolences. If you aren't going to let me in, just tell me, and I'll go home. No, not at all. Come on in. What are you doing here? You invited me over! Yeah, but Fifi, your grandfather... It's fine. He's super hot up close. Go on! -Stop it! -Let me go, you! Wanna dance? Sure. -You smell good... -So do you. It's Drakkar Noir. We got a new shipment in yesterday. Do you want some for your uncles? No, they got some off the Azzaro truck on Wednesday... Azzaro stinks. Yeah, it's old-fashioned now. Come on, we're going. -What, now? -Come on, we're leaving. What do you mean? I don't get it! We should have stayed. We stayed too late already. And you were clinging to Rabah like a monkey, forget it! You're the monkey. I don't care about him. You were clinging to your candy all night. At least candy is better than a party pooper like you! Party pooper! I don't care about Rabah, seriously. Stop it! Give me three nice lines, please! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six... Stéphanie, stand up straight! Three... Dance let me trade lives a few hours every week. Nadiège, our teacher, thought I was talented. Sometimes, she told me that, and... I liked it. Breathe, point your toes. On Tuesday, we start rehearsals for the recital at Jean Houdremont. Jean-Luc Lahaye and Rhéda will be there. That's right, the choreographer from Champs-Élysées. They're looking for dancers. So I want you all to give your best. The auditions are on the weekend of All Saints' Day. The city is letting us use the Château de Trilbardou. Oh, yes! -Are you OK, Fifi? -Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. She's always in need of cheering up. Stop sulking! We're going to do a show. You're going to dance! Get to the changing rooms. See you on Friday, and be quiet in the changing rooms. We're not alone here. -Nice bag. -It's old. -You don't recognize it? -No! What snack did you bring? Apples. It will be a change for you from Catalan-style tuna. Are you crazy, or what? I'm not a Frenchy. What do you want, tarte tapin? It's tatin, not tapin, silly. Whatever the fuck it's called. Your Frenchy stepdad is rubbing off on you. You've been eating too much Boeuf de Cro-Magnon. Bœuf Bourguignon, and it's disgusting. He cooks his meat with wine. Not very haram. You want one? You know, I saw... I saw Rabah with your brother Momo... the other day at the bar. Do you know if he said anything about me? Oh boy... you're done for. I don't care! That's not why I want to know. I was wondering about the Lacoste polos. Are you sure it's not his Lacoste underwear you're interested in? Don't be stupid! Anyway, I have other problems. My asshole stepdad will never let me audition for the recital! Shit. What is your brother up to? It's cold. He went to go find the keys. He takes forever to find his keys! What are you doing? You scared me! You're not at school? No, I finished my homework. Oh, OK... Mom, I have a dance workshop. Do you think you could... Ask your father! He's not my father. Stop it, please. Can I have a beer? Hey, my beer! Hey! Hey, damn it! My beer! Are you deaf, or what? I've had enough of your stupid singing! I had to convince my stepfather to let me audition. He didn't like it that I got good grades. He didn't like dance. Honestly, he didn't like me. You're not my father. Here! What are you doing here? Don't you start at 10:00 a.m.? So what? You want to see her! So what? You're not her mom! Seriously, Rabah, what do they teach you in vocational school? Don't make fun of me. We learn stuff... A trade. Going to school to learn to make crêpes, it's weird. We have books in our backpacks. What do you have? A whisk and a cake pan. Quit playing around! That's normal. He's learning to be a baker. You can't talk. You don't even have a bag. You can say what you want... but a delinquent who plays with guns all day and makes pastries is weird! Shut your mouth. Do you want me to break your teeth in? No one is listening. No one ever listens to me, anyway. I'm out of here. Have fun at work. Make nice cakes! Did you see how you were looking at him? How could I see myself looking at him? He'd have to be a mirror! -Huh? -Forget about it. Wait, there's Fatoumata. I'm off. You never do my homework. It would be too much work! You're such a bitch. Stéphanie Mortier. Very nice work, congratulations. The subject of your essay was where you imagine yourself 20 years from now. And Ms. Mortier sees herself as a Parisian. Stéphanie, please stand up and read your essay to us. Come on. "Like every girl, I used to dream of being a princess, "so in 20 years, I want to have married a prince." A prince? "We will live in a big apartment with big windows "in front of the Eiffel Tower. "On Sundays, my husband will carve the roast "using a knife with a pearl handle." "A pearl handle!" What is he, a musketeer? You're a real Frenchwoman! Ms. Ben Saadi, please shut your big mouth! What? What? Listen to yourself! You can't insult people in France! It's a democracy! Well, if this is a democracy, then shut your mouths and listen to your comrade. Go ahead, Stéphanie. Shh! Please continue. "I won't be scared anymore. "In 20 years, our neighborhood will be gone, "because nightmares don't last forever." What a whore! Betraying La Courneuve. Plus she's in 12th grade -and still in French class. -Enough! It's against the law. Well, fuck you! Who are you to call me a whore, fatty? Who are you calling fat? You look like a twig! Shut it, you! You liar! You want to move away, huh? Shut your mouth! What, are you ashamed? Are you ashamed of feeling superior? What, aren't we good enough for you here? I'm not good enough for you? What do you think? You think the girls in Paris will like you as much as I like you? You think they'll stand up for you? Just shut up! Hey, crazies, stop it! I'll get you! You're crazy! -Get off! -Don't call me a Parisian. Back in your seat! Good heavens! Are you OK? What are you doing? Just waiting for Karima. You don't have to hide your book. It's not like it's porn. You're pretty. You're a good dancer. I saw you the other day. Do you want some? Sure. How do you stay so skinny when you're always eating? Stress. It's good, isn't it? Yeah. Did your grandmother make it? No, my stepfather. -What? -No, I'm joking. You're a messy eater! Hey, Fifi! What are you doing? -Go on, I'm off. -I was waiting for you. Come on, hurry up. We've been waiting for ten minutes. And Kamel is super pissed off that you're late. I noticed you haven't signed up for the workshop with Jean-Luc Lahaye yet. What are you waiting for, Fifi? It's a big deal! This is our big chance! Go on! Come on! There! Oh, shit! Shit, I don't believe it! Get it together, guys. Into the center! Do it! To the center! Oh, shit! What an idiot! There are three championships in soccer, right? You're interested in soccer now? Yes. It's a bit like dance. It's nothing like dance. Come on, go! Which is the best championship? I'd say the most popular one is the World Cup. But the Champions League is pretty big, too. Does France have any chance of winning? If Rocheteau would cut his hair, yeah, we have a chance. It's a bit like dance. It's choreographed, -you work together... -Damn it! You know everything, huh? Get out of here. You're getting on my nerves! Interrupting me when I'm watching soccer... Shit! Come on, tell me. What did she say? Come on. Nothing! That's what she said. I want to dance. You're making me hot, Mimi. Turn around. Come on, Stéph, get up! What good are your dance classes anyway? Move your little butt... come on! Here! Come on, here! Bitch. -How's it going? -Fine. -How's it going? -Fine, you? I'm fine. Farid is such a baller. Look at that hottie he's driving around. She's not afraid for her butt. Her butt is nice and airy. It must smell like daisies in there. Like horses, more like. No, it smells like pussy. Pussy smells like pussy. Why would it smell like a daisy? I once fucked a girl whose pussy smelled like meringue. Meringue doesn't have a smell. Yes, it does! Like a vanilla meringue. Then just say her pussy smelled like vanilla. Anyway, Lahlou, you haven't fucked anyone. It was actually a meringue. That's why it smelled like one. You guys could talk about pussy forever. Hey, are you two fighting? You're ignoring each other. No, it's her. What are you talking about? It's you! She wouldn't take my necklace. Aïchik, you can't say no to her necklace. Come on, move! There! That's better. Fine, give it here. Look at that girl. What? She's hot. You're just jealous. Anyone would look hot in a skirt like that! It's not a skirt. It's a flag. I'm not sure Fatima would look hot in it. You think your mom would be hot in it? Hey, calm down, fatty! Leave my mom out of it! -Oh, so I'm fat? -Yeah! Whatever, Nana Mouskouri glasses! You're saying I look like Nana Mouskouri? Here's Nana Mouskouri for you, fatty! What? Here, from Michel Delpech! You fucking asshole. What are you doing? Get off! Let her go, that's enough! That's enough, let her go! Let her go. Stop it. You get off me! Dirty Jew! You can't say that, Fati. Apologize. We said apologize. -Never. -Or I'll tell everyone you have butt sex behind the dumpster, all so you can be pure on your wedding day. Come on, get off of me! You shouldn't have said that, Karima. What? What? Yeah, I said it, so what? She could stop getting fucked in the ass if she wanted to! What? Are you going to come eat? I'm not hungry... I have work. You expect me to believe that? You look like a whore. Stop pretending to hide in your books! Speaking of whores, do you want me to talk about your whore at PTT? If you touch me again, I'll tell my mom everything. I'm going to kill you, you little towelhead! I'll kill you! What did you say? Nothing, Mimi... It's your bitch of a daughter! Hey, Stéphou, can you French braid my hair? What are you reading? Zguègue? I hope he's not German! You know they gassed the Jews, right? Don't give my money to a Kraut. I have a scholarship, Mom... You know, he's a bit tense right now. I'm not giving him any. It stresses him out. You know men. They're assholes if they can't get their rocks off. I love coming here. I fantasy about getting married. Fantasize. Find yourself a man first. Stop correcting me all the time. It's getting old. Stop trying to be the neighborhood Shakespeare from a family of hicks! Look at the pink one! It's beautiful. It would look great on you. It's ugly. I'd look like a pig in that. It's pretty. Wow, look at this one! -Come on, try it on. -Truly, I'll try it on. My word, I'll try it on. Hey, ma'am, my word, I'll try it. Hey, you know, I didn't like what you said to Robert the other day. You can't be anti-Semitic, Fati. Stop it! You have to be put in your place sometimes, Little Miss Perfect always correcting us when we talk! No one is perfect, Fifi! What does anti-Semitic mean, anyway? That you don't like Jews. Stop it, I like Jews just fine. Jews are like Arabs who've gone to school. Respect to the Jews. And with everything you've been through, you're still here. Double respect to the Jews! You're ridiculous. Come on, I'm going to try it on. Check out the shoes... They're beautiful. Look how shiny they are. Yeah. Anyway, all I know is that I want a simple life: a husband, friends, good food to eat... I don't care about Paris and sequins. What? No, but this is different. Go on, raise your arms! I feel like I'm being patted down. Why do you have butt sex with guys? Why don't you find a nice guy who will love you? Like Rabah, is that it? Have you seen me? I'm not exactly a cover girl. I'm on the last page. Guys only come to me if they're starving! I'm the sales rack at a clearance sale. Wait for someone who wants you at least. I've had enough of your 19th-century values, Fifi. Hey, Fifi? What? You won't tell people... that... that I... you know what I mean. Of course not, I'm not a snitch. Stop going on about Rabah. We're not together. But you wish you were, don't you? Vanilla and strawberry, is that for you? OK! What are you thinking, telling your mom stuff about me? Stupid raghead! You were a mistake, Stéphanie. You know no one wanted you, right? Piece of shit! And a sterile piece of shit, at that. Piece of shit! What are you doing? Come on, come down! No, I can't. I have to work. Go on. I'll see you tomorrow. I thought about jumping a lot. A lot. To give myself courage, when I was ready to jump, I forced myself to think about the good things in my life: my grandfather's hair, and what it felt like... the first time I saw the sea... The thing that worked best at making me stop wanting to die was thinking about Fatima's first date. Her first and last, for that matter. You sat on the only piece of shit in the whole park! -What? -It's gross. What's wrong? Wait, come back! What is that? Shit, no, no, no! Stéphanie? Fifi! What? Let me answer before you start yelling! Here, my son, here! Stéphanie! Nadéra tells me you don't want to go to the country for the harvest this weekend! What is this about, ya binti? Never in my life! I'm not a farmer. What do you have against farmers, bitch? Don't talk to my niece like that. Peasant fag. Tell your brother to calm down. Forget it, Fanfan. He is afraid of you... scaredy-cat. That's enough. Christian, I promise to take her there myself. Of course she's going! It's settled! Well, that's settled then! Stop it! Christian was often tricked by Grandma Margot, especially when it came to his rural background. No one can fight kindness for very long. Go up to the dorms and get changed. Five, six, seven, eight! Take a 30-minute break. You're distracted, and it's a mess! You're doing it all wrong! You can't dance in this state. So get dressed, because you are warm now, and I don't want you getting sick! Come back in 30 minutes when you're ready to dance! Thank you. You know, Stéph, you've got talent. Would you like to join a dance company? I'd like to introduce you to Rédha. What do you think? I don't know... My stepfather wouldn't like it. I'm not talking about your stepdad. I'm talking about you. What do you want? I like... advertising, the French language and all that... And dance? But with dance, when you hit 40... and I might get fat... and it doesn't pay much. I want to make lots of money. Well, think about it. I knew I wasn't the real rising star in the group. The only one with serious potential was Kamel. Did you see them dance? They're amazing! I think Stéphanie is one to watch. She's going to be a great dancer. And Kamel, you won't find many boys who dance like him. He's graceful and motivated. He's in a bit of a hurry, but he's passionate, and that's the best motivation. Let me give you a kiss. Come back whenever you like. We're here for two more days. Thank you. What's your show called again? Get me out of here? No, Lahaye d'honneur. They're all the same. Yes, whatever. Take them anyway! Every one of them is good in their own way! What did you do to your hands? It's so my stepfather won't get mad. We told him I was harvesting. He's still on your case? Come see! Hey you, come here! -What? -You hit girls? -What? -You hit girls? -You hit girls! -Get off me! The towelheads tried to take my bag! But I fought back. Right? -Bullshit. -What? Damn it. You could have defended me. I won't find Christian charity in this house full of Jews! Stop it! -What? -What is this? Huh? I don't know. Mimi, I'm bleeding, damn it. Don't try to change the subject. Do you have a whore? Who is it, huh? Who is it, you dirty farmer? -Tell me her name. -Mimi! Tell me her name... I'm begging you, Mimi! For the love of God! Look at me! Look at me! Look at the state I'm in. I love you, Mimi. Help me. You can die, for all I care. Serves you right. Son of a bitch from the Son of a Bitch Olympics! Did your father hit you again? No, it was my brother. I'm tired of it. We'll get out of here one day, you'll see. Stop lying to yourself, Fifi. I'm not a liar. Yes, you are. You're a liar. -Are you crying? -No. Yes, you are. They're not your eyes. What do you care? CITY OF LA COURNEUVE I looked at your grades. They are excellent. How do you manage, surrounded by all those... the Arabs? I work hard. Well, listen. I've thought very hard. Don't you want to hear what I want to do, first? Sure, go ahead. Please, tell me. Here! This is what I want to do. You aren't the right size. For what? To be a model. I don't want to be a model! I want to write slogans! What do I need-- -To do what? -Advertising slogans. Slogans? Oh, boy! You want to be the Jacques Séguéla of La Courneuve? You're dreaming, kid. Let's see... UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS OK, let's see. UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS Programs, programs, programs... Saint-Denis has a fairly sophisticated linguistics program. That would be good for you. Marketing is playing with words. I don't want to go to Saint-Denis. It's full of Arabs. It's the headquarters of the ayatollahs! I'm not going there, no way! What do you expect, to go to a Grande École? Snap out of it! This is a high-priority education zone. You're not shopping at the Student Expo, kid! I'm not going to Saint-Denis Paris VIII. Fine, fine. Calm down. There might be a literature program at Paris IV, but it takes an application and a cover letter. But it's for Parisians. Unless you get 16 or higher on your exams... Then you might be able to request an exception. But... Be careful, OK? You are aiming far too high. What are you, anyway? An orientation decounselor? Sixteen or higher, you said? If I need a 16 or higher, then I'll get it. The orientation counselor never told me about prep school for the Grandes Écoles. I would have loved it there. So? So nothing. It's going to be hard to get out of here. You still haven't found a bag for your stuff? Stop showing off with your backpack, princess. I don't care. Where are you going? I'm going to see Rabah. You're crazy. Everyone's watching. You'll get caught! Stop it! Stop it, or I'll cry! Are you high? He's not the guy for you, Fifi... No one is, but he's the one I want. But he's crazy! He's a punk... When he was a kid, he blew up cats in garbage cans with firecrackers! Bang! He'll do the same thing to your heart! I think I love him, Fati. It's not forbidden to love. Stop talking about love. Love only gets you into trouble. Love isn't for us! It's too luxurious. -I love you. -I love you. Ah, yes, her paper. You're talking to her about her paper! Her paper! -About... -I'm off. -See you later. -Molière, Mozart, Verneuil, Racine and all that. You're going to get a horrible reputation! You know what's in the word "horrible", Miss Dictionary? "Whore!" We haven't done anything wrong! We haven't even had sex. Not yet, anyway. Shut up! Don't say things like that! Are you insane? Don't do it! Don't do it, or your life here is over! I'm going home. I have to study. You'd be dead in the Maghreb. But we're in France, here, Fati. You are going to have to get used to it. Don't worry. What are you afraid of? Nothing ever happens here. Nothing? Ask Larbi's car if nothing ever happens here... -Who is it? -It's Rabah. What are you doing here? I have a paper to write. Can you help me? Yeah, come in! I'm alone. Yeah, I know. Go ahead, that way. Are you cold? No, I have a present. For me? It's not for your mother. Is it a pizza? Stop making things complicated. Open it, please! I've been wanting these for ages! Are they real? Of course they are! Real 501 jeans for a real woman! What are you doing? Trying them on. They're stuck. Yeah, it's one of those new anti-theft things. I'll come by with Momo's saw and take it off. Thank you. The strong lemon flavor blends with the bergamot, and the vanilla brings a touch of morning freshness. And you will see, we have perfected the quality. My wife will be very touched. Is it a gift? Shall I wrap it for you? No, no, I'm in a hurry. My wife is waiting in the car. Scented Trèfle. A new collection. Young people like to have fun! What? You're a weirdo. You memorize commercials? What? You like Peugeot 103s. It's no different. But Peugeot 103s can be used to get around! Advertising is useless! No, it's not! And I want to work in advertising. I'm going to write slogans. I want to show you something. Come on! You're completely crazy. You know what's crazy? Everyone will remember it 20 years from now. You think so? You're completely off your rocker. Put something on, please. Your thighs are stressing me out. Oh yeah? My thighs are stressing you out? I want to marry you. Don't you want to have sex first? That's not why I said it. I swear on the Koran I want to marry you! You've never had sex before? Of course I have. I've done it... 1,000 times. I'm a bit scared. That day, we never found the entrance. We hadn't seen any porn. We didn't know we could use our hands to help. Fifi, over here. Look, the baker gave me the rest of her stock. She's closing for a week over Easter. She kept going on about her sick mom in the Gers and that her kids have to see her before she croaks. The Frenchies care so little about old people that they put them in homes until the day they kick the bucket. Anyway, I have to go to Présov. Apparently, Robert is still talking about me. Did he say anything to you? Yes, or no? Hey, are you listening? You're always talking! Don't you ever shut up? I'm allowed to have my own life! You think you're the only one who can have a life, Miss University. Mrs. Rabah... What is that? The results from my practice test. I got a 15.26 overall. Shit! Good job! I need 16 to get into the Sorbonne... I'm not gonna die here. You'll get it. Stop stressing. I flunked twice, and you skipped a grade. Worst comes to worst, you'll try again next year. If I flunk, I'll die. You don't need school. Look at Marilyn Monroe. Yeah... call me when you've got JFK. Oh no, shit! Come on, get rid of him, please! That's enough, fatty. I heard you! You're obsessed with her! Leave her alone. She has to pass her bac! Jealous! No one is obsessed with you! Wait, my brother Hakim told me about the time in the elevator. It's the Holy Day of Fucking! Are you crazy? You're mad! Do you want her to be burned? And she's Jewish, too! You'll get stabbed! Come on, let her go. Romeo and Juliet, you two. I've had enough of you two. I'm out of here. So you're going to the countryside for vacation? Yeah. I hate it. Do you want to marry me? Where did you get that? Moustapha got it for me. But it was stolen. You can't do that. I won't wear a stolen ring. It's bad luck! But I bought it from Mous! I'd rather you write me a letter. We've been waiting for you for an hour! We're going to Fortny. My parents are expecting us at 7:00 p.m.! Come on. Stop standing here with this... Calm down, Frenchy. Remember, we put up with you here. I understand. I made you a mix with your commercials and... all your singers having nervous breakdowns. Can you take the Walkman at least, or is that bad luck too? Thank you. You're such a little bitch. I'm off. I can't believe you're cheating on me. It's not like you're special! I'm being cheated on by a guy who can't even drive! I'll kill you, you shitty farmer! My mom was right: I traded my religion for a hick! Hey, Mimi! Keep your cool! Ever heard of dignity? I'll show you keeping my cool! I'm always keeping my cool! I'll show you keeping my cool! Drive faster, you. You wanna know what keeping your cool looks like? You clearly weren't alive during the war. Get out of my way. Go find your Jew! Shit. It does me good. Why don't you wear your glasses, Mom? Contact lenses don't agree with you. Look, your eyes are red... Because! They'll think I'm special needs. Mom, don't you think we look alike? No. I think you look like your grandfather... But we have the same eyes! No, are you kidding? You're much prettier than me. And my eyes are blind, whereas yours... You're a smart one. -How're you? -What are you doing here? I'm here to see you! How did you find it? Fatima told me the name of the village. It's so good to see you! How are you? -Fine, and you? -Fine. Wanna go for a ride? Sure! But I have to be back at the farm before dark, or my stepfather will beat me. I'll kill him if he touches you. Doesn't he get it? Where are you going, huh? You think you can just leave like that? Abandon your wife and daughter! Yes, your daughter, you recognized her! You can't just abandon us like this! Stay here, don't go anywhere! You can't! You're going to go find your bitch, huh? She must be in heat! You fag! Dictator! You don't get to decide! Hitler! Mimi, come on! Please, let me out... We've talked about it. It's over. I'm leaving you. No, you aren't! It's up to me, and I'm not leaving you! Let him go. Look at him and his stupid face! Shut up, you slut! This is none of your business! You're leaving me because of my daughter, is that it? He's leaving me because of you. You see how you've ruined my life? Let me tell you, Mimi. Your daughter will end up on the street. -That's it. -Get out of here! We've had enough of you. Beat it! If your mother would move her ass, I would. I won't move, OK? I'm not going anywhere. And neither are you. There! Are you happy now? Go on, Shakespeare, go climb your balcony! I have the keys! No! No! Mimi, no! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! No, Mimi! Ow, damn it! That hurts! Ouch! And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... One, two, three, four, five, six... Your arms, Stéphanie. One, two, three, four... Extend, extend... Point your toes! I had to get a 16 on my exams. It was my ticket to a better life, to the right to choose my future. I didn't want to spend my life in the projects. The idea of growing old in my neighborhood terrified me! Yéma, it's me, I'm home! Yéma, Fifi's here, too! Hello! Hello! -How are you? -Fine, and your mom? -How is your grandmother? -She's OK. Mom! No, thank you. She's going deaf! Move over! How's it going, Couscous? Stop calling me Couscous. Not many guys eat couscous sandwiches. You think it's normal to eat pig feet, huh? Who roll in the mud and eat their shit! You want some? Get out of here! What is that noise? What? What's that noise? It's just Pimpon. Pimpon! Chkoune Pimpon? Nothing, Yéma, the Pimpon for Aïd. You're a family of psychopaths! You have a sheep in your bathroom? It's not your bathroom. What do you care? Hey, little Alouche! It's your lucky day, huh? Stop it, Momo, you're crazy! You're going to kill it! We're not going to eat it alive. We're not savages! You can't kill a sheep in your bathtub! Hey, Brigitte Bardot, why don't you give me a hand? Shit, he bit me, the asshole! Cheh! Good! Are you happy? You're such a bitch! You're perfectly happy to eat my mom's tajine. Stop it, asshole! Quit biting my bro, would you? Stop it, Momo. Stop, you're hurting him! Are you stupid or what? Of course I am. We're going to eat it! That wasn't halal. You can't kill a sheep like that. Then go tell the imam. Your mother is Rambo, seriously. Hey, don't call my mother Rambo. Or a Mossad agent, then. What is that? Is that good or not? They're like Nazis but Israeli. Not at all. You're such a dumbass... He knows he lost! You're not barking now, are you? We shut you up! Respect to our mom! Respect to our mom! You have to keep this at your place. And this too, please. Dealing isn't a solution, you know. Stop lecturing me. You're not my wife. Oh, now that we're having sex, I'm not your wife anymore? Stop getting riled up! Of course you're my girl. You're not my wife yet, but you're my girl. I can't eat! Don't worry, I'm here. Don't worry! Hurry up! Good News Street... I'll show you good news. I'm going to kill him. Let me see. Let me see, I said... Oh, the fag! Get up! Get up, I said! The ground is for dogs! Get up! Don't give him the satisfaction. Get up! Let her go! Hey, hey! Hey, what are you doing? Hey, are you crazy? What? What? Come on, Sylvette! Come on! Come on! Get up! Get up! Now it's time to move on. My mother fell into a depression like you fall in love... madly... passionately. Here! I want to die. You hear me? You ruined my life. My husband is gone, my daughter has no father, my dad is gone... And now you don't have a job, either. It's up to you to decide whether or not your life is ruined. Do something, or I'm the one who's going to leave. It's calmer out there than in here. Ungrateful! You're so ungrateful! That's how you thank your mother who sacrificed herself for you? Come on, take your medicine. Here. Here. -Did you add sugar? -Yes. It's too hot. More... Extend here. And here... good. Your hips. Think about your hips. Forward. Forward... That's good. OK. It wasn't me, I'm telling you. Let go of my arm! I'm going to Club Med with my friend Nathalie. I don't know when I'll be back. Now that I have no job and no husband... I'll send you money orders. Your mother who loves you badly. I can't wait to go to Paris. Not me! -Come on, hurry! -Leave me alone! Oh, shit! Shit, I'm stuck! -Come on! -I'm stuck! Help me, Fifi! I'm falling! Shit! Wait for me. Stay there. Come on! Hey! Wait! Look, there's gold on the chocolate croissants! -Don't be silly! -Wait! Wait! Why did we have to come to the ends of the earth for a pregnancy test? You can't do it at home? Are you afraid the pharmacist will tell on you? She can't. There's patient confidentiality! Could you just shut up for once? Seriously! What's wrong with you? Are you in love? Get out of here! TOILETS So? -Who is it? -It's Mrs. Doukouré. -Hello. -Hello, Fifi. -How are you? -Fine. -I brought you some mafé. -Thank you. You have to eat. How are you? Move over, it's heavy. Come help us. It's for you! What is all that? We robbed a Saint-Marc Ménage truck this morning! Take some. You like cleaning! We cleaned out their truck pretty well. But you have 1,000 bottles! Quit your whining and take it! That's no way to talk. You and your stupid haircut! Hey, Fifi, can you do something about my hair? I look Black... The girls can't take me seriously like this! Even the cockroaches don't take you seriously! Come to my room. Blow-out! I'll take some. Yama, I don't know what to do. I either go to school and move to Paris, like at the Sorbonne, or I get married and have kids. The Sorbonne is good. Molière and all that... huh? Yes, or I could be a dancer. You're still going on about that? Like, a cabaret dancer or a dancer at the opera house in Paris or Moscow? No, on TV... Like on Champs-Élysées, with singers... Fifi... we didn't cross the sea to end up on the street. If you cross the ring road, it won't be to dance. If I have a kid, will you take care of it? Matahchemch? That's nothing but trouble. Don't even think about it. I'll study literature. I think that's better. I have to be smart. It's your choice, my girl. But if you go to school in Paris, promise me one thing. What? Don't eat their pork. It will give you mouth sores! That's it? All you care about is the food? I thought you were going to give me life advice. Fifi, when it comes to food, you choose your life three times a day. And no diets, OK? -No? -No, don't worry. You're beautiful the way you are. What? She's on to me! -Who? -The mail carrier. Shit! You're not even showing. You're only two months. No, that I'm on my own. The money orders from my mom! And she complained when I sent a package to Rabah in jail. His cell number was on it. I'm in deep shit, Fati. I'm in big trouble! Stop flipping out. You're scaring me! If she calls the social workers, I'm done for! They'll put me in a home and take the apartment! I'll end up on the street. Yeah, you're in deep shit, you're right. Your mother's gone, and you're knocked up. You're in serious shit, Fifi. Your mom has to come home. Way to cheer me up, Fati, thanks. We'll figure something out! There is always a solution. I heard that on TV the other day. All you care about is TV. Yeah, and all you care about is your books! To each their own. Don't worry. Smile, come on, smile! I don't want to hear you counting. No, Stéphanie, that's no good. You can't dance like that. You're distracting Kamel. Stretch. Come on, you're starting in 50 minutes. Anyone have any questions? No, we're good! Break a leg, everyone... Focus, have fun, and here we go. Stretch. HIGH HONORS Do you know why this happened? Because you didn't warm up. All because you didn't want to stretch. You didn't want to be like everyone else. Are you OK? Don't I get a kiss? I'm almost three months pregnant. I need an abortion. I didn't tell you in my letters, but I need help. Financial help. I have no one. He's coming with me. You're taking the RER with me! Come on, get in! Go ahead, I'm going with her. Oh, you're whipped! You're in love! You've changed, bro. Yes, he has. Anyone can change. Hey, Khaled, Fitzgerald, you ever heard of him? He said, "Living well is the best revenge." Think about that. What are you going on about? You're lucky I know your uncles. Start the engine! Let's get out of here. She's getting on my nerves. You know what, Rabah? She's your real prison. You had more freedom in jail! I got a 16 on my exams. I can request a transfer. Look. It's the letter from the General Council. What does that mean? It means I can study at the Sorbonne. I was accepted into the Language Philosophy program. Then I want to do a Ph.D. But if I keep this kid, I'll do nothing. I can't help you. The money I gave you wasn't mine. If you don't help me, you'll never see me again. Shit! We'll keep it. We can hide in the Maghreb while you have it. Then we'll come home. Don't worry. No. We can't. I don't want to. Don't you understand? I don't want to keep it. I can't do that to myself. Hey, anyone home? It's me! Are you OK? Am I interrupting? Are you enjoying my room? Fifi, come give your mother a kiss. You know you want to. Did you get my money orders? You like that, don't you? When you were a baby, you loved it when I rubbed your neck like this. How'd you do on your exams? She passed, Mrs. Mortier! With High Honors! I'm exhausted. Come on, Rabah, let's get out of here. Come on! Come on! No one except Fatima and Rabah knew I was pregnant. My stomach kept growing. I was in trouble. But I was there, with them, letting them think the only problem in my life was what shoes I should wear for my first day of school. You see that sidewalk there, Fifi? Pretend it's a runway. Walk, look around, choose a pair, and I'll do the rest. Don't you have something more important to be doing? Leave him alone, you. He's doing his best. I could see myself wearing Westons. Like Cinderella? You think Rabah's going to show up and put Westons on your feet? You're not together anymore, remember! Who are you, the love police? Why are you always getting involved? Mind your own ass for once! The only person who gives you shoes is your father when he throws them at your face! You like me. You're always teasing me. I'm sure you like me. Me, like you? Are you crazy? I don't like whales! I'm not... I'm not Flipper the Dolphin! Stop laughing. It's not funny. Yes, it is! My friends over there wanted to know if you're going out with her. Are you taken or free? Free? Yes, available! Ah... free. What do you care? Calm down! No need to get aggressive. Nice shoes. Yeah, my father feels bad, so he buys me whatever I want. I'm bigorexic: I exercise too much, running. I don't care. I get shoes worth 1,700 euros! Westons! I'm lucky! She goes running in Westons? What do we care what her life is like? You're as smart as you are pretty. Gimme your number, and I'll introduce you to some friends. Why not? I don't have anything against people from the projects! Viva la vida! OK, call me! Keep in touch! OK. Touching? She's already talking about touching? She's horny! Forget it. We'll sleep with her. "Viva la vida"? What bullshit. Stéphou! Come up here! Come on, I have something for you! I'm off. Bye! What is it? What is this money? Fatima told me you needed money for an abortion. Count it. There's 5,000 there. We have a winner, Patrice Laffont! Where did you get it? By working the streets. Geez, no... I'm not a whore, I'm your mother! If I don't help you, who will, huh? Come here! Come here. Micheline didn't tell. She went to her brothers and sisters and told them it was to pay for her divorce. My mother dealt with it. -Hello, ma'am. How are you? -Hello. I'm fine. How is Stéphanie doing? She's fine! Alech? I'll help you. OK. How do you feel, dressed like a little rich girl? Is the jacket too much? Yes. I'm off. Goodbye, Mrs. Mortier. You aren't staying? I brought some food. Eat something before you go. Come on. Live the life I didn't. Come on, Fatima... if I know you're sad, it will stress me out. It's not like I'm going to Australia! I'll be back this evening, and I'll tell you everything, OK? OK, but be careful. People in Paris are crazy, with their ugly names. They're all heartless! And there are cars everywhere. It's not like here where we can sit on a bench and talk... Paris is dangerous! Fifi? Stéphanie? That's my grandmother. I'm off. Here, I made you this. Wait... Look, I put some money aside for you. If you want to buy something to eat in Paris. OK? It costs an arm and a leg, there. Come on, don't cry, ya binti, don't cry. You'll be late. Go on. Why are you crying? Why do you think, Einstein? Get good grades, huh? That way, you'll run for office one day, and I'll vote for you. You're not even French. You can't vote! Yes, I am! I'm not a Frenchy, but I'm French! -I even ate a bit of pork once! -What? That's enough. We're leaving. Just a little bit! At Marcel's place. I feel ridiculous... with my shiny new Westons and my brand new backpack. Look at her, with her plastic bag. Fati would be happy to see that. They're so classy. They all look like Catherine Deneuve. Don't get taken in by the Parisian guys. They'll try to hoodwink you with their pretty words and rich people apartments. They might have the screw, but you have the screwdriver. Remember that. What are you going to do? I'll go back to Africa. You've never been there before. A guy like me has no future here. With my face and my rap sheet, I'm screwed. I'm scared, Rabah. You're braver than you think. The next time I hear about you, it'll be on TV, OK? Or in the papers, OK? I remember 1987 like it was yesterday. Time passed so quickly. My neighborhood didn't change. It got smaller. Bit by bit, they destroyed the cabins where we made our best memories. Présov, Rue Renoir, Debussy, Balzac... People moved to other, smaller neighborhoods. Rabah bought a prosperous piece of land in Kabylia, where his mother and my father came from. I saw him again in Paris a few years ago. He wanted me to come back to Bejaïa with him. Kamel Ouali is exactly where he wanted to be. Nadiège said he moved too fast. That didn't seem to hold him back. Lahlou is no longer with us. Christian is alive, though. Life isn't fair. Micheline is fine. Margot is fine. She's 90 years old, and her heart is still going strong. Everything is fine. The table is always covered in food. Nothing new there. Oh, wait! A miracle happened in La Courneuve. Fatima found a husband, a Frenchman. He's handsome, very handsome. They say she cast some sort of spell on him, that she forced him to marry her. She doesn't care. She's happy. FOR THE COURNEUVIANS OF YESTERDAY AND TODAY AND FOR ALL THE CHILDREN OF THE REPUBLIC Melanie Kathan Subtitling: Hiventy
