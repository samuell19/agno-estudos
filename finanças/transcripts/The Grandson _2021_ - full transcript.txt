FLASHBACK MEDIA PRESENTS WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE NATIONAL FILM INSTITUTE HUNGARY A FILM BY KRISTOF DEAK Bend and twist and pay attention. Step forward and back. And right and close. And one, two, three... Good. And open and back. The gentlemen bow now. Thank you. Next up is everyone's favourite bit... The Dance of Joy. Think of something that makes you happy. Ready? And... - Rudi! How's your day? - Hey Pappy. Pretty good. I felt like calling you. I'm on my lunch break. Best part of the day. What's for lunch? Mushroom cream soup and... bolognese. Mhm... So those must be the dishes clattering. You got me. How was dance class? It was alright... you know how it is. A bunch of old fans, stumbling around... I bet you went crazy with all the foxy grannies. Jealous, are we? At least I know what life is all about'. In 40 years I'll spend my daytime dancing, too. 40 years is pretty ambitious with your level of self care. We'll see... Gotta run, see you tonight. - You doing OK? - I'm doing great. Could be worse... - but that would be pretty bad! - But that would be pretty bad! ' Alright. love you pa _ Bve_bye_ uny- - Hello. - Hello. - Sorry to bother you... - Let me check our database... - Can I sign you up then? - Thank you for your time, goodbye. We're collecting for Kati's birthday. You know all the people here. - You do the top floor, I'll do this... - I owe you one, thanks a ton. I'm really glad I finally reached you. We're offering an exceptional deal on our award-winning book series... Kélmén's team needs to be moved to the top floor. They're really in the zone right now. You can sort it out in overtime. - Right? - S... sure, yeah... Well, then... Hello. - Good evening. Mr. Ra's-z? - Yes. Who is this? Good evening. This is Captain Vértesi, district police. - Good evening. How can I... - ltis quite urgent'. Who in your family holds a valid driver's licence? Well... my son, daughter in law, and my grandson. - But... - By name please? Mrs. Katalin Racz and Rudolf Racz. But what is this about...? I see. That checks out. Thank you. I had to verific. Well, I'm sorry to say I have bad news. - Rudolf is your grandson, right? - Yes. Why what happened'? There was a quite serious traffic accident. I'm on location with the investigation unit. Your grandson didn't give right-of-way. A BMW side-swiped him. Massive collision, pushed him 15 meters or so... We located you as a relative through his license plate number. I see. The paramedics are stabilizing Rudolf, but he's unconscious. I'm sorry, but his lung got punctured. His respiration has collapsed. They're fighting for him. They're taking him to hospital as soon as he's stabilised. - We couldn't reach his parents... - I'm leaving right now. Wait, sir. There's another problem. Your grandson's car insurance came up invalid. The BMW's passenger is badly injured, the car is total led. A fortune in damages, by the look of it. - With your grandson at fault. - But... then... Because of the bodily harm, it's reckless endangerment. But if he dies, it becomes an even graver felony. I'm sorry, but we are required to take the perpetrator into custody. But you just said he's unconscious. The protocol requires us to take him straight to the penitentiary's infirmary. The prison hospital. Thankfully I was able to reach you. - (Maybe we can still do something. - Yes, yes). What can be done...'? I might be able to persuade the other party's family to withdraw charges. If you'd offer to compensate them for the damage, - I think they can be convinced. - Yes! We'll pay for it! How much? Well, I'm no expert', but this looks like a really pricey car. We 're talking at least 8-9M forints here. Oh... I don't know where you 'll get that much in the middle of the night... I have some at home. Not all of it, but maybe it'll be enough. OK, sounds good. By all means, do check. How's Rudi? Unconscious for now. - Let me know when something changes. - Of course. One moment. Go check on him please. I'm on the phone with his grandfather. - I need both hands to count the cash... - Don't hang up! I'm just putting you on speakerphone. I'll wait for you to check. Oh, dear. Is he at least transportable? Right. I'm told the injured passenger needs surgery right away. He's hanging by a thread. The ambulance is taking him now. - Three, four, five, six... - Hello...? - I'm here! Don't you disappear on me. We're going to help your grandson. Calm down. I'm sure there's a solution. I've been able to negotiate situations like this... - I'm here. I'm done. 1,203,000. - Sony? One million two hundred and three thousand. That's all I have at home. Well... - That sounds a bit scant if you ask me. - I should have... some foreign currency... Deutschmarks... I mean, euros... Of course, better than nothing. The damage is at /east 8 million. We need some ground for negotiation here. Hang on for a bit, please. I just don't get it. He's always so careful... Things happen when you're tired, no matter your experience. I've seen far too many of these cases. You found it? - One moment. - Of course, no rush. - Oh, I got it! - Great'. It's a thousand. Euros. In forints, that's about... I don't know. - I don't know the exchange rate. - Anyway, it is something. - Anything else you can think of? - One moment. We'll send a patrol car to help you get to your grandson. Your address please? 42 Reitter Street, district 19. I found a little more in the meantime. - Good. 42 Reitter, noted. - Yes. Calm down, everything will be fine. - I need to check this one last place... - Take your time. - We 'll help your grandson. - Thank you so much. My colleague will be there in a few minutes. Hold on... Yes! - I found more! - Excellent! Put it all in a sealed envelope, write your name and the sum on it. - OK? - Yes, yes... Take it downstairs to save us some time. What's going on? Rudi... How's Rudi? One sec, let me check with the paramedics. Please hold, don't hang up. - Are you there? - Yes. It looks like they can leave for the hospital... I'm almost done, just finishing the envelope, hang on... Good. Things are looking better; carry on. OK, fill it and get it signed. - I'm almost done. - OK OK. - So... - Yes? He is stable now, not in a great shape though. They're taking him to Honvéd hospital. Head downstairs, my colleague will be there in a minute. Sheis a brunette, Captain Hernadi. Do check her name though. Don't give the money to just anyone. I'll wait til! you find her. Your phone is cordless, right? It is. I'm on my way now. Thank you. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Your colleague's here. - Hernédi. I came as fast as I could. Thank you. - This is all I could find. - I can't take it without a receipt. Put the sum here and sign at the bottom. 1.227.000 forints... and a 1000 euros. - Well... We'll see if it's enough. - It has to be! Could go either way. How about throwing in that nice watch too? Purely as a gesture. They won't take it. Just to show them your commitment. Of course, take it. If it helps even a little... It's important to show our good intention. You'll get it back soon enough. They won't need it. I've put it on the receipt. Here you are. I should get going. Start packing quickly, sir. We're sending a patrol car to take you to Lészlé hospital. Goodbye. Wait! It's Honvéd hospital, isn't it? That's what your colleague said. No, it's Lészlé. Their ER department is on night duty. - My colleague was mistaken. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Mr Réczm? - I'm here. - Finally. - Everything OK? Did you give it to her? - Yes, she's left already. Good. The ambulance has left, so has the patrol car. You should start packing. Pyjamas, slippers and a change of street clothes. A towel would be good, the ones at hospital are... Toilet paper, soap, toothbrush... What else was there? The dialled number is not available, please try again later. - Papp y! H1} what is up? - R... Rudi...? Is that you...? Yeah, why? Who else? - But... How are you...? - Don't even get me started. They made me stay late again. Sorry I didn't call... Wh... Where are you? I'm walking up to the gate now. The gate? What gate? In front of the house. Pappy... What's wrong? Pappy...? What is it...? Pappy! I'm here... THE GRANDSON Ferenc Récz? Lieutenant Jelinek. Follow me. How do you think he knew your grandson's name? Because you mentioned he spoke of him by his name. - I told him. Like an idiot. - No, it's a frequently used method. They start with crumbs of information, then extract the rest during conversation. - Typical "grandparent scammer" move. - "Grandparent scammer"? Grandparent scam. A technical term for this type of fraud. Quite prevalent. At least 4-5 cases per week. What a senile old fool... - Do you catch them? - Well... it's tough. They move around a lot. Teams of 2 or 3 people, constantly changing phone numbers. But eventually they always get busted. And what do you folks do about it in the meantime...? Twiddle our thumbs a little, wax our shoes, have a little snack... Then we pull call data from the provider, we triangulate their position, cross reference recent reports... All these things happen in their own time. With a bit of luck, I'll kick the bucket by then. Couldn't you pull the data right now!? And there's cameras there, too... The whole thing should be recorded! Mr. Récz, believe me when I say we're doing all we can. Time's on our side. Let's not be hasty. And we get closer to them with each case. No one got hurt, that's the main thing. Everyone's fine. That's what matters. Right? Yeah, whatever. Come on, Pappy, this is pointless. We're just wasting the officer's precious time. What about signing the report? You're welcome. - Hi Dad. - Are you all right? - We came as fast as we could. - What happened? Your father is a senile idiot, that's what happened. Here's the report, it's all written in there. He needs some rest now. That... that's good. I don't get it... - How could you fall for this? - Leave him be! I know you're not asleep when you don't snore. I'm asleep. I'm asleep. Today's list is up, chop chop! - Hi. - So, should we start with a break? The boss is messing with you, right? He'll sqeeze the living crap out of you if you let him. You've got to set your boundaries. Boundaries... that's not my strong suit. Never too late to start. "Take a deep breath and try again." I saw that on a fridge magnet, too. It's just that I had a really bad day yesterday, and... Tell me about it. The people out there. Yesterday this lady told me all about ringworms in kittens. I could write a PhD on the topic. Pensioners... They just love chatting, that's the trap right there. I get it - they don't have much else to do. They crave company. Still, if you sense they won't buy, hang up ASAP. - That's the secret. - Must be hard... You can't just go on talking to everyone all day. - How nice of you to talk to me. - I think I cut you earlier. Never mind... - I have to run. Go get them. - Go get them. Hey PAPPY. are you...? Sorry, who is this...? You got here fast... Peanut You haven't called me that in ages. How are you, Pappy? - Oh, you know, could be worse... - but that would be pretty bad! A couple more IVs and I'll live forever. They're hooking me up at 4PM... to some beer and vodka. I leave you alone for a minute... Put a GPS tag on me if you don't want me wandering off. Good idea. Let me grab a veterinarian. What's up, PAPPY? Where's your watch? See, I was not in my right mind. Even then, I didn't suspect a thing. I gave them all of it. Gladly, without a punch, without a word... A proper robbery would've been better. Do you remember the brand? Why do you care? Let it go. It's gone for good. Of course I remember it. You should too, all the times you played with it when you were little. Yes, what is it? Morning, sir. I'm Mr. Récz's grandson and I'd like to... - Right. You live here with him, don't you. - Yeah, I do. Temporarily. So the thing is, yesterday my grandfather was... I know, the phone scammers. Terrible. OK... anyway, I've noticed a bunch of cameras, and I'd like to get the footage because he gave them the money right in front... I can't give you those. Need a police warrant. I'm sure they'll show up. But you don't understand. They won't show up. They need weeks to get off... Well, they better hurry, 'cause the footage gets wiped after 24 hours. Goodbye. This is really important to me. Priceless, really. - How much do you want? - Not much. I just want you out of my face. 5 minutes and I'm done. I don't want any trouble. Who do you think you are? This is trespassing! Mr. Zsolt! Should we tell the girls upstairs about how you... trained the cameras on them? I guess they haven't noticed them, ogling their bedroom window? I think they'd be flattered... MR ZSOLT REALLY KEEPS AN EYE OUT FOR YOUNG FEMALE NEIGHBORS...! Shut up! Goddammit. The fuck are you standing around. There you go, HAPPY? Here you go... It's up on the wall. Plenty useful. - You know how many of these we have? - So you'll just sit around and do nothing? We've been doing a lot actually. Retrieved the scammers' call details. The caller was driving around the district, then stopped around the corner from your grandfather's place until the end of the call. He only used the SIM card once, then threw it away. - And whose name was it registered to? - Doesn't matter. These gangs have a supplier with buckets of untrackable numbers. - Then that's the guy we need to find. - What an excellent idea... Since you've brought it in, we'll look at the footage. - How's your grandfather? - In hospital. Brooding. |'m sorry to hear that. Spend more time with him. Take him to this place. It really helps. HAVE YOU BEEN VICTIMISED? You've already done more than most people. Stop investigating. ANTIQUES SHOP How dare you! This is a decent business! Get lost! We don't do individual sessions anymore, can't keep up with all the new cases. But we do have a group, you're welcome to join. I'll put you on the list if you want. COMMUNITY CENTER Please all come and sit down. For the sake of first timers, we start by going around. Everyone tells us how they've been. If they thought of the incident at all, and share their feelings about it, OK? Vilmos? Hello all. It's getting better. This week, I'm down to only two episodes of stomach cramps. Both triggered by the phone ringing. I guess it'll go away. - Thank you, Vilmos. Béla, your turn. - Me? Well, greetings, everyone. I have trouble sleeping. I'm getting more senile... I see the bad in everyone. I used to be a people person. Uncle Béla, you can trust everyone here. We must never blame ourselves. These are professional criminals, they can fool anyone. But they don't just fool anyone. They come for us, the elderly. People don't give a crap about doddery old hags like me. Then you get a call, asking for help... And of course I want to help out. I want to feel useful, not like a burden to the world... My daughter asked how much they took before even asking how I was doing. They don't need us any more, do they, Pista? Articulating our deepest fears is the first step towards healing. - Gyuri? - You've all been through the same I have. We're all brothers-in-arms here, am I right? But this young gentleman - no of fence, but- what does he have to do with our business? I'm here for my grandpa. He was hit so hard by all this, he ended up in hospital. I was the bait. Worse than the money, he also gave them his watch, an old family heirloom. I was hoping to maybe get some tips here. Something that could help me get that watch back. But I feel the same kind of helplessness. That I wasn't able to help my grandpa... Thank you. We're going to reenact Bé|a's case. Please pull your chair forward, to participate. - This will do. - Let's begin. - You can help your grandson... - How could you believe him? Does your grandfather even know you're here? No... I mean, of course he does. But... Don't think everyone buys your bullshit. One advantage of getting screwed over. My scam detector's gotten much sharper. Why are you here? I really just want to get the watch back. But I don't know where to start. At least you want to do something about it. I like that. This lot is all talk, meditating, therapising... When this is over, meet me outside. I'll show you some real therapy... Enough! Enough! Stop! Let's change back into our ordinary selves. Thank you. Come on. He's coming too. Good kid. Vili, let's hear it. So Mérti says violent thoughts are bad. That we should suppress them. Well, I tried. But in the end, I'd prefer punching that piece of shit until his eyes disappear under his swollen face! Cheers to that! I wouldn't complicate it. I'd pour two big buckets of icy water over him then let him roam in the cold in Siberia. But before he's frozen stiff, I'd kick him in the balls as a bonus! Cheers to that! I'd tie his arms and legs up, prop his mouth open, then take a million in pocket change and feed it to him. With a lot of grease to help it along! The least you can do, right? And I'd throw a bottle of chili sauce in the mix, too. Just for the taste! Stings twice - three times if he throws up! I'd scrape out the leftover chili and smudge it in his eyes! Let him cry, too! Come on Béla! Let's hear the new boy. - What's up? - Goon - I'd also start by tying him up... - Damn right! Then I'd grab a red hot iron. And roll it down all along his back, - nice and slow, to make him sizzle! - Oh yess! Then I'd grab that iron and stuff it all the way into his mouth! Let's throw one back to that! Now, warmup's done, time for the main course! - Who wants to start? - Give me that. Come on Pista, we don't have all night. Give us what you got. Who's the old fart now? I'll shoot his dick off! Useless, and a burden... my ass! Watch your stance! Me? Come on. My granddad really isn't well. That watch was really important to him, he inherited it, too. They got rid of it ages ago. You should ask around all the thrift stores, pawnshops, flea markets... I've been everywhere. Wasted days and days. What if they haven't sold it yet? I need to find them. That's the spirit. What's your plan? The police told me how these gangs get their dodgy SIM cards from a supplier. I just need to find out who that person is. How many criminals do you know, sonny? Because they're not really keen to make my acquaintance. Or wait a second... lca! Ica darling. Listen here. Your Palika, he keeps changing his number, doesn't he? I don't know anyone named Palika. You know, Palika, your dealer... It's OK, you can talk in front of him. Hemp's the only thing that helps with her sciatica. Hemp? Grass, weed. lndica. You know: cannabis, marijuana... And it's completely natural. I can't live in pain, now can I? So I have a guy. Hi Mrs. Berger. - How's it going, sweetie? - Everything's cool. I brought you some birdseed. They're gonna love it. How kind of you. Did you see how these roses were blooming? Yeah, they're pretty. They tend to over-trim them a bit though. All righty then, I'm off, just wanted to check on you. - Bye. - Bye-bye. - Thanks for coming. Excuse me...! Hello! Young man! Bro! Just a moment... Wait! Let me just... I only want to ask you a question! - I wasn't running away... I just... I didn't do anything. - I'm not... I'm not going to check your bag. I'd only find a pack of birdseed, right? With a little cash inside, from Mrs. Berger... And that's not illegal, is it? My parents can't find out... If you cooperate, we won't take you in. I promise. Really, I'll help you with anything. That's the spirit. We know you're buying your SIM cards from somebody. That's who we want. - Don't even try warning him. - No, no, I swear I won't. Am I... free to go now? So it still only counts as a successful call if it ends in a sale. The targets will come from the new owner's database, which is the best on the market. Look. Financial status, estimated by address and other data. No minimum wage pensioners here. They're all perfect prey. Thanks, Rudi. Rudi! Thanks. You're welcome. The hit ratio is doubled, so expected conversion will rise, too. From now on, you've got to pull every third call... No way I'll keep shoveling shit for you! 30-15 30-15 That's a four. - Now for a long one... - Good. Long! I won! Is it legal to do this to a sick person? No more excuses, now you'll have to eat. - I'm not hungry. - Tough luck. I win, you eat. Eat some, there's plenty. Did you sleep alright? I don't remember. - That's the beauty of dementia, you see. - Pappy... ls there a woman I don't know about? Who's Dementia? By the way, I went to this weird therapy group they have for the... victims. I think it would do you good. Poppycock! I've already forgotten the whole story. I've got better things to do. You too. Where is my radio'? I want to listen to the news. Find it for me, will you? I've got the CCTV footage, too. The woman's face is clearly visible. - I took it to the police. - I don't want you dealing with this. Whatever happened, happened. Paid the price, learned the lesson. I won't be so stupid next time. You were worried about me. And they exploited that. Everyone gets what's coming for them somehow, sometime. Why doesn't this piece of crap work? - Did you take the batteries out? - Not me. These crooks stole them! I know exactly who it was, dammit. That chap! - Are you sure there were batteries in it? - Damn right there were! Hey! Calm down, Pappy- - How could they? - I'll find them. I got it. Look. Give it to me. All right then, go ahead. Good morning. Could I talk to you about my grandpa? Yes, hello. I've been wanting to talk to you as well. - |'ve got his detailed test results. - All good news, right? Trust me, |'d much rather chat about good news... They told us he could go home soon, with the oxygen tank. Home? That's a definite no. His cardiac muscles are severely damaged, the venous walls are in a bad condition. He's not twenty any more, there are no guarantees at this age. But there's hope for improvement, right? GSM OASIS MOBILE PHONES - Hello. - One moment. Here I am. Go on. I called earlier. I'm Pali's friend. - How many do you want and what kind? - What's on the menu? We have an exceptionally rich selection today - there's blues or yellows. And... Whose names are these registered to? I don't care why you need them, you don't bother where I get them. So how do I know they're safe? Pa|ika's happy, you will be, too. - But if you've changed your mind... - No, no, not at all. I'll take... - A test batch of ten. - Good. Is there a chance you know this lady? |'d really need to talk to her. 30 000 forints. Sure. Well, if you do remember her, tell her that... a colleague is looking for her. I want to buy something off her that's very valuable to me. You can reach me here. Hook me up. It's a business matter. Business matter, huh? Right then, amigo... This is the place where... curiosity comes to kill the cat. But you, little brother... You're face screams 'rookie' so loud it's hurting my ears. - Don't jog around here for a while. - OK, OK. - Yes? - What do you want? I can... only tell you in person. Let's meet. I don't do 'in person'. You can'! name a sum big enough to change that. Bye now. Wait...! I know something worth more than any amount of money. Phone numbers. Personal details. All you need to rig the game in your favour. I'm looking for a buyer. Tonight at 6130. I 7/ text you the place. Come alone. OK. But how will I recog... Yes, it's based on a new patent. Completely waterproof. Is it for a girl or a boy? I'm just asking because of this week's special deal... Shall we go for one or two, ma'am? Remember how I taught you? I've never shaved someone else like this before... |t's harder than I thought. I wish you took care of yourself as well as you take care of others. This is no way to live. Alright then, that pretty nurse can finish trimming your ear-hairs. At least I've got a pretty nurse. But what will you do when I'm not here anymore? I want to leave knowing that you're all right... You'll get better. Look at us talking, cracking jokes... Jokes... One's trying quite hard to keep a cheerful face. You'll be fine, you just have to get out of here. Come on, help me out, will you? If I don't make it out that door in time then we have a real problem on our hands. EIFFEL SQUARE. BRING IT WITH YOU. DON'T BE LATE. There we go... Come on, come on! Rudi...? Hey! You here...? The printer keeps jamming, they asked me to fix it. But you shouldn't even be allowed to... Don't worry, it's all good now. What were you messing with on the terminal? Just printed some test pages. But I'm good now. Right, I've gotta run. See ya. Bye. Goddammit... Hey! The dialled number is not available. 'Roland'? - Hi there. - Hello. I don't get it... I spoke to a guy. You've been showing my picture to every Tom, Dick and Harry. |'ve got something that I think would be interesting for you. - A list. - A list. Fucking amazing. THE list. The best list out there. Ideal clients. Seniors from Budapest - age, funds, perfect in every way... - Where did you get it? I don't care why you need them, you don't bother where I get them. Show it then. I'll only talk to the boss. Tell him to come here. - Is he close by? - Are you a cop? Here it is. Hundreds of pages like this. And it works. I want a taster. If it's really that good, I'll go get the big boss. Why don't you use it yourself? There's plenty left for me, too much, even. - But if you don't want it, I'll go alone. - Hold on. Good evening, am I speaking to Mrs. Szfits? Pardon me for bothering you so late. This is Eszter Sijttfi, attorney. I'm calling about an unfortunate problem. Your grandson was caught driving drunk early this evening, he caused an accident and was arrested. Yes, yes, Gerg6... We'd need to post bail as soon as possible. It's a hefty sum but you'll get it all back when your grandson shows up in court. Great, thanks. I'll ring you back in two minutes with the details. Bye. Fuckin' hell! One out of one. We could've got her, easy. You throw back the little ones? That worked as a test. We'll buy it. - How much? - I'm not negotiating with you. - I have a condition. - I've got cash in hand. - Let's not jerk around. We can offer... - What happened to getting him here? Oh, that? I lied. Oops... He's not even near. - You said you would... - He's not really the meety-greety type. - How about I take a sample, and... - Rudi! I've been looking for you for ages. Will you introduce me? Yeah... We've only just met, actually. What was your name again? - Vivi. - Great. I'm Zsuzsi. I'll leave you be, then. Bye-bye. - Where do you think you're going? - Let me go! She's getting away. Who the fuck was that girl? I saw you doing business with her! Hey, stop! Are you deaf?! I can't believe this shit. I'm talking to you! You think I'm a complete idiot? You're stealing in my name! Who do you think you are? We're reporting this first thing in the morning. - You're not gonna bullshit me... - We're not reporting anything, because the whole thing happened under your name. I used your card. If you make a scene, you'll be in deep shit too! - You don't get it... - YOU don't get it! This was my only chance! I had that motherfucker, but you just had to screw it up! Sorry, I just... This chick... she's with the scammers - who conned my grandpa. - The... what now? They rob old people. We just let her run off with a pile of records, which can be traced back to us in a moment. Sweet mother of God. See, you get it now. And do you get it?! Do you realise those are real people on that list? Fuck, I'm going to prison because of you! - I didn't mean to give it her... just... - Yeah...? You distracted me. That's just fucking great. What exactly happened to your grandpa? They fooled him. And THIS was your master plan? Well, yeah... kind of. Come on. And whatever happens, always ask them to show you their ID. And don't share any personal details. These are very professional criminals. Right. So let's go over this one more time... Good evening ma'am, this is Rezs6 Forgécs from the district social office. Apologies for calling so late, it's a warning about a gang of con-men... I see. I'm so sorry. Goodbye. They claim your relative needs money urgently. But don't... Let me call you back in a minute. Be vigil. What's up? - What happened? - We were too late. She was the last one on my list. I had one that said "can't connect". We need to go check on her to make sure. Let's go! She might have moved. Or she isn't at home. They won't find her either. Like that's going to give me a good night's sleep. - I live nearby, I'll walk home. - Are you sure? Tomorrow is a brand new day. We'll show up at work nice and early and never think about this again. OK. But if anything comes out, I'm not going to be quiet and take the blame. So you better make sure nothing comes out. - I will. - Bye. No... no, no, no... Don't give it to her... don't... Please don't... Come on, pick it up. Good e... Good evening. My name is Captain Forgécs, I'm phoning you from City Police. Do not be alarmed, ma'am. The person you just gave money to was, sadly, a fraudster. Your family member is all right, you may call them if you like... Yes... You can make a report first thing tomorrow. We'll get your money back. Alright? OK. Thank you. Bye. WHERE ARE YOU? WE HAD A DEAL! EVERYBODY'S LOOKING FOR YOU! - Get the fuck out of my way! - I'm going... Calm down! Great, I was just about to abuse the shit out of you. We don't have time for this now. The gang leader! - He's about to squeeze an old lady! - What'...? - I don't know what to do! - How did you find him...? - Does that matter? He's right here! - Where?? Call the police! They'll never get here! He'll be long gone! Then... I don't know, hold him up somehow and most of all, don't get involved. - I'm going inside. - No.../ That's n0t...! Sorry! This is Domi, my little grandson. All right, he's not that little, but to me he is. Is the young gentleman here for lunch? Nah, the little fiend wants his laundry done. But I like doing it, at least I get to see him sometimes. - In you go. - Pleasure to meet you. - Domi dear, come on. - I'm coming, just loading the laundry in. What are you mucking about? Soup's running cold. - I can't tell which program's which. - Alright sweetie. - Anything coloured in there? - Just my usual blacks and grays. I should be able to pick it up tomorrow. Should be dry by then. - And I'll iron your t-shirts too. - You're the best. - Eat up. You don't eat enough. - I just want to enjoy it. I've put some in a box for you. You're the best, Gran. This is for your birthday... - Get yourself something nice. - C'mon gran... I insist. It'll come in handy. - You know you shouldn't have. - Don't be silly. Now... How is your job hunt coming along? Still waiting to catch my big break. But I always find something to keep me busy. You'd be better off with a decent, stable job. Look, I even marked a few for you. Here, "basic IT knowledge, to start immediately". Worth a try, right? Granny, trust me, |'m doing all I can. I'm on it, |'m getting back on my feet. - Did you check the mail? Anything for me? - Just the usual mess. Threw them all in the bin. What's the point of wasting so much paper anyway? Well, when they're after your money nothing is too dear. - They're after a pensioner's money? - Everyone wants your money. The world is full of crooks. You have to be really careful. - Especially old folks. - I'm careful alright... Maybe you think you are. You know their latest trick? I heard this a couple days back. There are scammers who call you that I got into some kind of an accident, and that they need money immediately. If anything like that happens, hang up and call me immediately. Sure... Zsuzsanna - there're two guests here looking for Rudi. Can you help them out? We're actually looking for Rudolf Récz. An elderly lady filed a report this morning, and we hit upon something connected to the case. Our system logged a call, contacting the victim. Do you think this might be your coworker's voice? Good Evening, my name is Captain Forgécs, I'm phoning you from City Police. Do not be alarmed, ma'am. The person you just ga ve money to was, sadly, a fraudster. Your family member is all right, you may call them if you like... Yes. - - You can make a report ﬁrst thing tomorrow. We'll get your money back. Similar but it can't be him. Because this voice belongs to a self-assured, gritty man. That guy is a hapless, candy-ass loser. He's good at exactly one thing: follow instructions like a robot. He's not the best at that, either. And we don't exactly need rocket scientists around here. Why, what does this company do anyway? This is a call center. We make phone calls. We collect debts, conduct polls, we do government 'surveys', we palm off useless crap. But to what end...? Don't ask me. Well, I need to go, because a 5 minute break counts as full lunch at this 'amazing' company. You thought I don't notice being tailed? Well, I fucking do! The fuck do you want? Why are you following me? Are you OK ma'am? Wow! What a pleasant surprise. - What are you doing here? - What happened to your face? Never mind. I don't even want to know. You thought I wouldn't figure out what you did? I called the poor lady immediately. She totally freaked out. She wouldn't have come here alone. I wanted to tell you... - This is so wrong on every level! - I didn't have a choice. 'I didn't have a choice'... You sound like a total prick. Yeah...? Just when did you become so conscientious? Suddenly you're not bothered by old people? Zsuzsa, I'm a little tired. I'd go home now. Aunt Rézsi, let me introduce my favourite colleague from the Department of Social Affairs. He's a very nice, responsible man. - My pleasure, ma'am. - How do you do... We've heard astonishing stories tonight, isn't that right? So many lying, conning, evil people out there, right? One of our friends, for example, was deceived twice by the same colleague. At least your friend's colleague is trying his best to... |'|| stay out of this, thanks. Tell our friend's colleague to stop sneaking around and playing the hero. I think he's pretty fucking small for this game. Let's go, Rézsi. I'll let him know. Whoa, son! What happened to you? This will sting a little. I assume things didn't go as planned. - Alcohol. - Here you go. I found them. I just wasn't careful enough. But you did teach them a lesson, right? - I did, sure. - You shouldn't leave it at that. Well, should he run into a wall head-first again? I know their weak spot now. I'll go back there. My late brother was a policeman. Do you know what he used to say...? “Never show up at a party empty-handed.” - This shooting business is not for me. - How do you know if you've never tried'? Come on, sonny. Nice shot, darling. - Come on, Géza... - Away with those toy guns. Just a second, Teri clear. The young man needs his practice. This is gonna be a little louder now. Alright son. Gotta have a grasp of two things: your gun and yourself. If you're not in the right mental state, then... Not bad for a first. Not my cup of tea, I guess. Well, I can't force you. Who wants to try it? I'll need to make it up to the neighbours anyway. - Hell, yeah! - Come one lcuka. Load. That ain't no air rifle... - That's the spirit! - Give me that! - Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. Hold on a second, I gave you a 2k note, you short changed me. - You thought I wouldn't notice? - I'm really sorry, my mistake. I might be old but I'm no fool. - Is this all? - Yes, thank you. Excuse me, let me help you. May I? Oof. That must be a real struggle for you. If you're going towards FUredi Street, I'd be happy to give you a hand. Yes, I am going that way. - Do you live around here? - Nearby. But I grew up right here... - Are you having guests over? - No guests. I cook in big batches. My grandson visits today, he always gets a goodie bag. Market produce is the best. Absolutely... So? Can I sign you up, ma'am? Monthly recurring then? Thank you. Perhaps... I can interest you in the higher tier...? Isn't it the best feeling in the world, being able to help like that? So we agree. No, I thank you. Goodbye. So he tells me 'this can be done through the Government Gateway only'. I'm like - I'm right here in person, can't we do it now? I don't know how to use a computer. My grandson brought me one, it's just sitting there, I can't even turn it on. This is me. I live here. I'll take it up the stairs. I bet the elevator isn't working. - How do you know? - It never works in these houses. - Forever under maintenance, isn't it? - Yes, all the time... May I offer you a cup of coffee? No, thank you. It was nothing. - Thingies? - Excuse me? Sweetener thingies? For the coffee. Or do you take sugar? I take lots of sugar, thank you. Oh clear, it just had to run out now, didn't it? I'll be just a minute. Coming. Oh, that's a really nice one. My grandson gave it to me, you know the one... You mean I know your grandson? No, the painter. I can't remember, famous though. I'll ask my Domi... Doma. Doma? Is that his proper name? Domonkos. But he doesn't like that. - Is that him? May I? - Of course. And his fiancée, Vera. They're sweet, right? They're colleagues, right? - What makes you think? - Just a hunch. I bet your grandson's working day and night. |t's hard to meet people like that. Well, he does bits, here and there, my poor child... He's looking for a job right now. - Nice couple. - They are. I didn't catch his last name? Halész, like my late husband. Why? He just looked so familiar. I thought I might remember him by name. Maybe you went to the same school. You said you grew up around here - which school did you go to? - No, |'m sure it's not from school. - No? Thank you for the coffee. |'|| get going... May I use your bathroom? Sure, of course. |t's the second door to the right. Shall we take a look at that Government Gateway thing? I work with computers, it's my job. Well if it's not too much trouble, why not? - It shouldn't take more than five minutes. - It's right back here. That's the one. - How long has this been sitting here? - I don't know, six months...? - Doma keeps saying he'll fix it up. - It's chock-full of dust. Oh, dear, let me bring a dust-rag. That won't do, I need to open it up. Do you have a screwdriver? There might be one in the pantry. Let me check. I found one. It's not going to work. The case is locked with a key... It must've been a company workstation. - I'm sure my Domi has the key. - At least we tried. I'll be going, then, ask him about the key. - Thank you for your help. - My pleasure. It was nice meeting you, Zoltén. - See you soon, Mrs. Halész. - Bye. Zoltén! Not so fast! Young man! Stop! You almost forgot this. Rudi, dear... I'm glad you're here. - Did you run? - A little. Wait, let me catch my breath. Are you feeling better? You will be in a moment. What are we so cheerful about? I got it back, Pappy- Is this... my watch? See, we thought there was no hope. And look - here it is. There's always a solution. And... how...? I hope you didn't pay a price too dear. I guess it was a bit of a struggle... But nowhere near as hard as for Great-grandpa back then... I don't want this anymore. PAPPY, come on, - I didn't bring it back to you for... - Wait. The story you know... didn't quite happen the way I told it. This watch was not given to your Great-grandpa by the brother-in-arms he saved in World War I. It was given to me. One World War later... A friend and I - we were barely 18 at the time - we sheltered in an abandoned flat during the siege of Budapest. We barely ate anything for weeks, we were shivering. After a while, a Soviet unit showed up, they moved in to the same apartment. We didn't understand much of each other, but they let us be. One day, they sent us down to the street to help carry the dead. Lots of corpses. We put them on stretchers and carried them to the mass graves. And then, on a dead man's wrist, I saw a watch. This Ukrainian soldier saw what I was doing. But he only smiled and gestured for me to take it. And I... I took it off his wrist. So... Great-grandpa didn't save anyone, did he. This is the watch. But... I don't understand. Then why did you wear it? I put this watch on every day, riding the tram with my hand put up, hoping that someone might recognise it... and I finally get what I deserve. As the years went by, I kept it on to remind me. Just how easy it is to commit a big mistake. And, when that woman took it, it felt like Fate, finally catching up with me. And I didn't care about anything but praying that you're safe. And why couldn't you have told me? Why did you have to make up a whole story instead? I was ashamed. For years. I was so proud that you always looked up to me. I still look up to you. I always have. I just... I got this back. Never mind. I thought it would make you happy. But I am HAPPY- I'm happy for you. Not all stories were so glim those days... There was a very pretty young girl, some nights we were on guard duty together... I'll tell you next time... - Could you please move over? - Yes, of course, I just... May he rest in peace. This is it. It's over. That bastard is still out there, robbing people. - He has to be caught. - What for? He's out in a couple of years anyway. Well, then let's make it so that he stays locked up for good. You just need to lead me to him. There is something that... I haven't told you. I wanted to catch them so bad, I stood by and watched them rob an innocent old lady. I should've intervened. |'m just as shitty as they are. The only mistake you made was not doing anything. Just like you don't want to do anything now. The only important thing is that we'll catch the leader. And he'll get what he deserves. A grown man should finish what he's started. What would your Grandpa say if he saw you quitting something important? I heard about your Grandpa... I'm so sorry. I quit the job. I think I'd rather help these old people. We've basically been robbing them blind. Let's have a coffee when you're ready. Bye. Hey Granny, what's up. Domi, honey, thank God you answered! - Are you OK? - Sure, why wouldn't I be? Oh my God, I thought... Your boss called about the emergency, - I got so scared I wasn't sure what to do. - Who did what now'? Your boss rang and told me there's trouble at the company, and you need 10 million forints urgently, - I should take it to the Cultural Center - What boss...? But where would I get 10 million? - I'm so confused... - Granny, listen to me. - Don't move, don't let anyone in. - OK. - Got it? Nobody! - No I won't. - I 'll be there in a sec. Get dressed. We're leaving. Dressed...? Granny! Motherfuckers. You stay here and search the whole place, gather everything connected to us. Got it? - Excuse me, do you live here? - Sure. Do you know which floor Mrs. Halész lives on? I do actually, she's third floor to the right. - Thanks a lot. - You're welcome. - This way. - What is this place? - In there. - Stay quiet and listen. - But... Zoltén! Is anybody here? Who the fuck are you? I've been to your Granny's house. She's knee-deep in your dirty laundry. - Where's my money? - Come on, don't hold back! Come on! Don't worry, I won't pulp your face this time. Drop the knife! Kick it over here. Hello there, Domonkos Halész. The only question left is who you are, List Boy! |'m the one who lost his Grandpa because of you. You are mistaken. - I'm an honest entrepreneur... - Stay back! Step back and shut up! You're a piece of shit, petty con-man. And now we wait. So, what should we do to this scoundrel? - Shoot him! No. Let's not get carried away. We stick to the plan. You rotten scumbag! Whose shitty idea was this? Yours, dude? Do you know how many nightmares I had because of you? Do you? Did you tell your friends about our little business? List Boy! Give me the hardware. Here, in a pile. Take the masks off too. Move back! Hey, hey, hey. Nobody goes anywhere! I don't want any harm. I'm only here for my money. - That's our money! - You took it from us! Don't think for a second that you can get away with this, scum! You can shoot me if you want, I don't have much time left anyway. - Me too. - Me too. Where's my money? Same place as your Granny. - Sit down there. - OK. Where is my money? - I don't negotiate with murderers! - I didn't kill anybody. Your grandfather died because he was old and sick. You kicked him into the grave! WHERE'S MY MONEY?! You haven't really been asking about your Granny... What do you want from me? You think I visit my grandmother for her great company? Nobody gives a fuck about old people. They are waiting for them to die. So that they can inherit something... You think all this money is in better hands with them? Time is money, too. And I don't have time for this. I'm counting to three. One... SHAME ON YOU! I really wanted it to not be true. I was in denial. Even when I saw the money. "He must have scrimped and saved it..." "Maybe he didn't trust the bank..." Then this nice young man told me what happened to his Grandpa. Granny... that's ludicrous... I didn't believe it either. Not even after seeing the video. With your 'fiancée'. Even then, I kept telling myself: "|t's not true. He's not like that." "|t must be a mistake. Maybe this woman got him into it all." Give that to me. Granny, we're family. We stick together, alright? Let's get the money back from them, and disappear... we'll fix this, alright? Look, help me out here. Did you see where they put it? We won't 'fix' anything. - I'm not going anywhere with you. - We've got to, Granny. Your place is full of my stuff. Do you think they'll buy that you weren't in on this? The police are on their way there. The boy wasn't lying. Your money's here. Come on. Make it tight. Here you are. I think this one is yours. I'll be damned... Look at all that cash... Our money! Is it bad? Could be worse. Thanks. We'll do it with this one. Pass it. What...? That gun was stolen from me. You of all people should know. I filed a report with the police. That gun doesn't exist. Your plan was cute, but I'll take it from here. We each give him a good-bye slap. Then |'|| do what has to be done. Pass it. Son. This man is dangerous. A Psychopath. A machine, repeating the same pattern over and over again. There's only one way to stop him. Look into your soul... Deep inside, this is what you want. Everything led to this moment... Hey, no need to go hardcore. - We can all split the mon... - Shut up. - Are you mad?! - That wasn't the deal! - He's lying! Give it to me. For your grandpa. My grandpa would never want any of this. Not this way. No. Then we'll do it another way. - Gyuri, calm down! - Put that down... - Stay back! - You can't do this! - Someone will get hurt! - Have you gone totally mad? - Put that shotgun down! Get out of the way! - What are you doing? - This is insane! STOP!!! Hello, Police Dispatch. How can I help you? Hello... How can I help you? Are you there? My sweet little grandson... I'll have to disconnect if you keep silent. Yes... This is Mrs. Anna Halész. And I've caught a scammer. We're at Rézsa Center of Culture, 32 F6 Street... Come quickly. All available units. Ongoing fraud case, civilian interception. - 32 F6 Street, Rézsa Center of Culture. - Roger that. On my way. - Hello? - Hi there... This is Rudolf Récz. I'm calling from Guardian Angels. Hello. I'm Zsuzsanna Farkas. I'm calling from Guardian Angels. Can I take a moment of your time? We are raising awareness about phone call fraud to elderly people. I'd like to use a few minutes of your time to teach you how to recognise and avoid these...
