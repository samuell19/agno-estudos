(explosion booms) (crowd cheers) - And let's get rid of these crooked politicians! (crowd cheers) With all their corrupt minds! Make them clean up these filthy little corner markets! Get rid of the rotten meats they always want to sell us! Let's open up our eyes, open up our minds. Martin Luther King once said he have a dream, well so do we have a dream. We want to see the mountaintop, we want to see all the good glory! (crowd cheers) Give us some decent schools! (crowd cheers) We want all the good jobs! Let's let them know that we can wear suits and ties, and we don't have to tell lies. Let's get ourselves together! Let's unite, let's be constructive towards one another. We got a long ways to go, young people. And you're the ones that can take care of it. If the ones that are over you can't help it, then you've got to clear the way. Clear the way and make things easier for the ones behind you. (crowd cheers) (funky instrumental music) - Blanche? Blanche! Come over quickly, the new neighbors are here. - [Blanche] Who did you say they were? - All the real estate agent said was that he was a very successful doctor with a beautiful family. - [Blanche] Good for you, Mabel. After all you went through with that broken down, supposed to be a writer, and all his wild parties. - Tell you what. Let's invite them over for coffee and get acquainted, shall we? - [Blanche] Sure, why not! - Oh, yes! And we should introduce them to our country club. - Look at that car, that alone must've cost a fortune. - [Mabel] That must be the chauffeur and maid. - They don't look like servants to me, Mabel. You don't think the agent sold to niggers, do you? I think they must be our new neighbors. - She's the maid, and that's the chauffeur, come on. Hello. My, the Kincades are very fortunate to have such a charming maid and butler. When will the Kincades be arriving? We're planning a welcome luncheon for them. - I didn't get the name. - I'm sorry. I'm Mrs. O'Dell and this is Mrs. Jacobson. - Ladies, I am Mrs. Kincade, and this is my daughter Debbie. My husband, Dr. Kincade. - No, you're the maid, and he's the chauffeur. - And this is my son, Tommy. - Mabel, get a hold of yourself. - I won't let them! I won't let them move into our neighborhood. Your kids will never go to our schools, you'll never join our clubs, or be accepted in any of our homes! Why bother to unpack? Just go back where you belong! You'll never live in that house in peace, I'll burn it down myself before I let you live in this community! Get your black hands off of me! (intense instrumental music) - Why, it'll drive down property value! - All right, gentlemen, gentlemen, let's not panic. I never saw a man yet who wouldn't make a fast buck. This doctor will sell. - I suggest you look before you leap. This Kincade has received a grant for his medical research from a prominent foundation. This foundation is supported by a federal agency. - George? - Well, we can use the homeowner's contingency fund, have the association buy him out. - Then buy it back from them, it's that simple. Pay them twice what they paid for it, if you have to. But get them out. Agreed? George, I want you to get out there immediately and make an offer to this-- - Oh, you'll forgive the expression, Mr. Dudley. Jim Crow. - Whatever his name is. Oh, and Paul. Be sure to remind this fellow of our strict building codes. The City Planning Commission will give you help if condemnation proceedings are in order. - I heard they would steal anything that isn't nailed down. And they say if a white woman goes with a black man... - You don't say. Really? Tell me more. - Next thing you know, they'll be busing nigger kids out here. - Yeah, let's keep them in their own school. - No niggers or Chicanos! - We fought the Indians for this land, they didn't! - Damn right. - Yes! (intense instrumental music) - [Broadcaster] We interrupt this program for a news bulletin. A black family has moved into Meadow Park, and this has created a near riot. Many angry whites have gathered at the home. That's all the information we have at this time, so stay tuned for more information. Now back to our regular programming. (funky instrumental music) - All right Marco, let's go man. (intense instrumental music) (loud commotion) - I'm glad the city authority's finally arrived. - I'm George Peabody, and this is Paul Hunt. We're from the Mayor's office. I was sent here to see what we could do about solving this problem. Sorry I took so long getting here. - I see. Then you're not authorities of the law. - No, Doctor. And I may I say that we from the Mayor's office are not like those people out there. - Never mind, I take it then you're here on business. - Dr. Kincade, the Mayor's office is dedicated to one thing. Solving the problems of all the citizens in the community. And you Doctor, are a citizen. - And you are going to solve my problem? - We are. Now, the men at Park Homeowner's Association has gotten together and found an answer to this little problem. Now, you paid 200,000 dollars for this house. What would you say if I told you, we have a cash buyer, right now today, who is willing to be 300,000 dollars for this house. - I would say sir, you could take that money-- - Would you gentlemen care for some coffee? - No, thank you. Uh, 300,000 dollars we're offering. Now, I'm willing to bet that no white person in Meadow Park would turn down an offer like this. - I am not white, so maybe that's the difference. - You bet it is. - Now look. Doctor. Mrs. Kincade. Have you considered Boyle Hills? It's a nice neighborhood, and I'm sure I can find you something. - It's too far from my hospital. - What the hell are you trying to do, make a martyr of yourself? - No. I've moved three times, and in as many months because of bigotry and prejudice, and I'm drawing the line here in Meadow Park. - Dr. Kincade. Would you take some time and think it over, several days perhaps? - A few days, a few years, a few centuries. And my answer would still be no. Now you go and tell your committee that, and that's my final answer. Good day, gentlemen. - Doctor. (loud commotion) - Square out of the way. Step back, step back. (loud commotion) - Hey, when are they moving out of here? - Well, when they do, I can recommend a good fumigator. - Folks, I ask you all to go to your home! - Hey, does that mean they didn't accept the offer? - Does that mean that we gotta keep right on here living with them? - I think you folks might have a permanent neighbor. - Hey, let us near. (loud commotion) (funk instrumental music) (knocking) - Looks like things are kind of rough out here, Doc. - Yes, there seems to be a prevailing ignorance. Uh, my wife and two children. - How do you do, John Abar. Crusader. This here is Marco, thought maybe we can lend assistance. - How is it that you're here? - [John] Well, we heard it on the news. - Ah yes, well your arrival is quite timely. Very impressive, very impressive. You and your men take great risk. Are you armed? - No, Doc. Our tactics are strictly defensive. I mean, we wouldn't foolishly invite the pigs to shoot us down. - But the risk. - Hey man, our thing is to help the brothers and sisters in the ghetto. In case of emergencies, we have ways to protect ourselves. There's others. Preach on, Brother Abar. - Well, you seem to be very well organized. - Well, the idea is spreading. - What is the name of your organization, how is it supported? - From contributions. I mean, donations of every kind are needed to support the sisters and brothers down there in the ghetto. - You seem to be doing a great service for our people, and for us. What is the name of your organization? - Black Front of Unity. - Oh yes, I've heard of the BFU. Well, we are most grateful, and will give every assistance possible. - Yeah, well... You can begin right now, Doc. - And how's that? - Yes, in what way? - By thinking about moving back to the black community. - Well, that's more of a personal request, wouldn't you say? - Yeah well, you see Doc. if you weren't out here living up in this fancy crib but living in the ghetto where we can lend a hand to our less fortunate sisters and brothers, my men wouldn't be subjected to such danger. - Mr. Abar. We appreciate your concern and involvement, but my choice is to be here. I want to thank you for what you have done, but I have my reasons for not wanting you to be here, I'm asking you to respect them. - Ken! - Well, their awesome and imposing presence could kindle a riot, and that's the last thing I intend to happen. - Well, what do you think that was out there, huh? A welcome wagon? Come on man, let's split. (funk instrumental music) (calming piano music) - It's been four hours since the animal received serum. Respiration is returning to a more normal rate, but it's still one and a half times normal. Pulse rate is still the same, returning to normal. Also at approximately the same rate. No apparent side effects just yet. First human test subject would have to be in superb physical condition in order to withstand the accelerated bodily functions. However... (doorbell rings) (loud scream) It's all right honey, get hold of yourself! - What is it, Mommy? - It's all right, Debbie. Go to your room, I'll be right up. Go on, do as I say. Come on honey, let's go upstairs. - How could they Ken, how could they? - It's only their way of trying to tear us down. - Let them have it, let them have this house. Their poor, wicked minds are warped. Please, Ken, take us away from here, please? - We'll talk about it in the morning. - We're not dealing with sane people. - What's the matter? - Tommy, Debbie, will you please be quiet? Go on, I'll be right up. (whistling) What's the meaning of this? - Hey, he wants to know what the meaning of this is. - I don't know what the hell he's talking about, do you? (funk instrumental music) - All right, let's clean up the rest of this trash out here, huh? - Always seem to be in the nick of time. Why did you return? - Well you know like, Doc, still believe in helping out the brothers in this kind of situation. - Well... I'm afraid I need your help after all, Mr. Abar. - Yeah, I hear you Doc. - I'm afraid for my family right now, they must be protected until the people here become more accustomed to us. Now if you would provide that protection, I'm sure we could reach an arrangement, say, in the form of a substantial donation to you or your organization. - Why don't you let me think about it, huh? Come on Chuck, speed it up, man. - Well, I would rest easier if you would start tomorrow, but of course if that's too short of a notice... - No, no, no, no. Why don't we discuss this in my territory, huh? - Ah, the sooner the better. - You'll find that I'm a reasonable man, Doc. If you see things my way. - Oh all right, Abar, thank you. - Yeah. (funk instrumental music) (laughing) - Mr. Abar has quite an imagination. A classic collector of garbage. (laughing) I'm to go and discuss with him the possibility of protecting our home. - Yes, I heard. Ken, we can't go on living like this, one filthy thing after another. - Bess, give it more time. - Time? That's what you said the other times we moved. And in the end, we had to leave anyway. - I've expended a great deal of energy and time for the construction of my laboratory. By the time we find another home with sufficient lab space, this thing will have settled down. - And in the meanwhile? - In the meanwhile, I'm trying to find an answer to a broken dream. - A dream, here? What good will your dreams be if we're all dead? - Bess, my work can't wait any longer, neither can I. I'm through folding up my life moving back into the shadows whenever we're threatened. - Is it worth all the insults and threats those people throw at us? Seeing all the hate they feed on? - Bess, I drew the line when we moved here. Maybe even before, and I have got to back it up. - And if the violence doesn't stop, will you give some serious thought about leaving this house? You don't want it if none of us will ever be happy here. - Bess, I'm not inconsiderate, you know that. What I'm working on is of the utmost importance for these most grave and tangible times. - Ken, what is it? - If I could tell you, believe me, I would. The concept is such tremendous magnitude that one day it will alter the destiny of the world. And I always want you to remember that, always. And I do love you dearly. All I ask is that you have faith in me. - I do have faith in you! And I love you, with all my heart, I love you. Believe me, if it weren't for the children. - Yes, I know. - Why can't they just leave us alone? - Aw, good morning, children. - Daddy, what's wrong with mother? - Your mother's a little upset over what happened last night, and a few other things. - I can't blame her, such a mean and cruel thing for anyone to do. - I hate them, I hate them all, they killed our cat. - Son, you must never say that. You remember when we had our dog Toby? - Yes, Daddy. - And how he was suffering? Well, while you were holding him, he snapped at you. Did you hate Toby for that? - No. - Well, there are all types of people with broken minds and broken hearts that need mending. And they snap at each other because of their suffering. So, when someone behaves badly towards you, just think about Toby. Okay? - But Daddy, why do we have to live in this neighborhood? - Because they're like Toby and Daddy is a doctor, and he is going to cure them. Dad, there's a park just a few blocks away. Can I go there and play? - [Ken] No son, you better stay close to the house. - Now you remember what Daddy said, or you'll be a little boy all your life. - Aw shut up, you Watusi Wobbler, who cares. - Lamont Chemical Company? Dr. Kincade. I'm inquiring about an order I made several days ago. That's correct. No, I'll come in and pick it up. Fine, thank you. Bye. (sobbing) - And as I've said over and over again! It's time for our so called leaders, and our black elected politicians to get off their rumps! Well now, what an unexpected surprise to have the good Dr. Kincade here in our midst. Tell us, good Doctor. How does it feel living in that palatial home bought by the poor black folks here? (loud commotion) Now this brother is just as guilty as the white man. As soon as he made his money from the poor blacks in the ghetto, he took it over to the white neighborhood to spend it. (crowd jeers) Not doing anything for the less fortunate brothers that he left here behind. That's exactly what I think he is. How you doing, brother? - Could we go someplace and talk? - Yeah, I know a great place, where's your car? - [Crowd] Right on! (loud commotion) (funk instrumental music) - [Ken] Mr. Abar. What is the purpose of your ghetto preaching? - [John] Purpose? Just look around you, man. There's your answer. Or are you one of the same as most bourgeois blacks, just don't give a damn? - [Ken] Oh, come on Mr. Abar. When you see one ghetto, you've seen them all. - [John] Exactly. But what's being done about it? - [Ken] Plenty. But more can be accomplished by the black voting block. - [John] Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee the right people getting into office. Already we have too many unconcerned politicians, black and white. City hall doesn't hear the cries of the poor people in the ghetto asking for jobs, and not welfare. So many of them are strangled by the ghetto through unfulfilled promises of unscrupulous politicians. Now, if these people had more influential blacks like you working for them, I'm sure we'd see some more changes. - [Ken] Well, unfortunately, there's some truth in what you're saying. But these things have a way of being solved. - [John] Yeah, sure, Doctor. One day the ghetto will just vanish. - So you see, Mr. Abar, I myself and my family are in a more dangerous situation than I had previously perceived. - So what you want me to do is be some kind of a bodyguard around the house, and around your family, huh? - [Ken] That's entirely correct. - Why not just move back to the black ghetto? - I don't have time to move back just yet. When my research is over with, I'll give moving back a strong consideration. And Mr. Abar, I'm presently involved in trying to find a prevention from heart disease, I also need someone of your physical stature to run some tests. - Uh, sure, Doc. - Then you'll come? - [John] Yeah, yeah, okay. - Oh, fine, excellent. You'll get wages for this, of course. - (chuckles) Yeah. About these tests, what is it that you're gonna want me to do? - Oh, nothing very complicated, or somewhat strenuous, I need to test the heart under different conditions and so forth. You'll have to undergo a thorough physical examination. - Yeah, well I am a very healthy man, Doc. - So you appear to be, but we can't leave anything to chance, there could be harmful repercussions. Report to the medical research lab at the university in a few days. - What's happening, Tommy? Everything all right? - [Tommy] Okay, I guess. - Sure, you've been taking care of the crib while your dad was away? - Yeah, the best I can. - Good boy. - Where's your mother? - In the house. - Get out of my yard, you little nigger, you! - Give me my frisbee! - Out, get out, you little pickaninny! - I want my frisbee! - Don't you ever come in my, why you little black bastard, get away from me, get away! - Daddy, Daddy, Mr. Abar. - What happened? - She took the frisbee and wouldn't give it back. - Abar, get her into our house. - Who is your doctor? - Dr. Swanson. - Of Meadow Park? Operator, give me Dr. Swanson, Meadow Park, it's an emergency. Dr. Swanson? This is Dr. Kincade, I'm with a patient of yours who has just fainted. Mabel O'Dell. What is her medical history? Oh, yes. Oxygen, yes, of course. Oh, that's most unfortunate. All right Doctor, thank you, bye. She needs oxygen, it's in my car. - Yeah, what she needs is a breath of fresh air. (mysterious instrumental music) (loud yell) (screaming) - Stop it, stop it! (screaming) - What's going on? - [Man] Wait a minute, big fella, I'm his brother! - Abar, it's all right! - What's this guy, some kind of iron rhino? - Oh, I'm sorry. Ken, Bess, I told Jim not to play such horrible jokes as that. So whatever you got, you deserved it. - It's all right, now that we know. - You could've been killed. - Hi, kids! - Hi Uncle Jim and Aunt Susan. - How are my sweethearts? - Hey, baby. Look here, would you remind me never to be such a jackass again? Even if you have to hit me with something, it's better you than this cat. Hey, what is he? Some kind of watchdog or something? Hey wait a minute man, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. - It's all right, Kincade. - Hey, it's me that's sorry. - You children go on upstairs and watch TV. - Yeah, I'll see your children in a few minutes. - So you're the young man who's been storming the neighborhood with the black troops? - Yeah, that's right. - I need someone around, especially when I'm away. - Yeah, but with him around, you should have eternal peace. - I'm curious to know why you came to your brother's house in that stupid masquerade you got on. (chuckling) - Jim has always been the trickster. - Yeah, well I fail to see the humor. - It's just that I've always left the serious side of life to Ken. - Hey, there's a serious side that both of you gentlemen fail to realize. - [Jim] Yeah, well what's that, my man? - And that's the ghetto. I mean, there's lots more serious work to be done in the ghetto. - Yes, well I agree, it's still in a sorry state. - Yeah, well that's why we need men like you two to return. I mean, Jim, you're a little more fortunate. You live over in Rosedale where the whites are more civil. But the Doc here, he's living under great risk. - Sometimes I wonder which is worse, living in among the thugs and the junkies of the ghetto, or these ignorant whites. I don't know, man. I suppose I found the answer by living in Rosedale. - Yeah, I bet. Yeah, well if you excuse me, I'm gonna watch a little TV. - That's a rather abrupt and direct young man. Of course, a lot of what he says is true though. - Come on Jim, let me get you a drink. - Hey, I'll buy that. (mysterious instrumental music) So it's been an ordeal living here, huh? - Well, they didn't exactly welcome us into their lily white world with open arms. - What about Bess? How is she taking it? - Oh, pretty rough I guess. - And the kids? What about school? - We're going to have to keep them out of school temporarily. - Damn, Ken. You know, I could understand you're trying to move ahead man, but when you put all of this first ahead of your kid's education, then you must really ask yourself is it really worth it to me? What I would say, hell no. - No, Susan, that's Ken's lab. - Yeah, I know. - Off limits. - Say, what is he working on this time? - I never know. He's so secretive, sometimes I believe this house is all wrapped up in it. Really spooky. - No honey, just spooky. - Now I understand they offered a hell of a price for this house. - I'm really not in the mood to discuss the matter. - Oh, come off of it Ken. What sort of a mood does it take to refuse 300,000? - Is this why you're here? Is this the next way of hitting the shoreline of the Kincaid's home? How much did they offer you, Jim? - Come on, baby. This is me, your brother. Do you think I would allow myself to be bribed against my own brother? - Money has been known to weaken the spirit. - All I want to know is, why do you have to live here? What are you working on that's so important that you're willing to live in jeopardy? What's going on in that lab of yours? You always were the silent type. Ken... The truth of the matter is, they didn't offer me any money. But they did threaten to withdraw my contracts from the city. Is living here so important? - So baby, this house is out of sight. Oh, Ken, fix me a drink. I mean it, Bess. This house is out of sight. (calming instrumental music) Well, as my mother used to say, keep a happy home, keep a happy husband. - That's right, baby. - Anyway, I do hope things settle down so that you can enjoy this house. - I don't think things will ever calm down. - Abar, were there any black cowboys when you were a little boy? - Not hardly, Tommy. Hey, and I'm not that old either, man. There were a few black cowboys. See, there was Deadwood Dick, he was black. Meanest, baddest, toughest of them all. - Gee, Deadwood Dick. Baddest of them all. Pow! - Aw, Tommy. - Say sis, we've gotta leave, split baby. - Don't leave yet. - Well, Jim has got a few important calls to make, and since I don't get to go out too often with my husband, I better go see what he's up to. - Say, it's nothing that you'd be ashamed of, baby. - Oh, she looks that good, does she? - Well, if she did, you wouldn't be here. - Oh, you finally admit it. - Hey sis, can you have a word? Come on. - Well, I'll walk you to your car. I've got to go and replenish mankind, pick up some furry rabbits. - Bess, you must watch him, we can't have our good doctor spreading all of that good wheel around. - Well, I'll leave that to the rabbits. - It sure is a fine looking specimen a woman. - You're not thinking what I'm thinking, are you? - I sure as hell am. Let's go. (mysterious instrumental music) (intense violin music) (water splashes) - Abar, what is it? - Stay there. - I'll get to you, black bastard! (intense violin music) - Deadwood Dick. Deadwood Dick. (western country music) (loud commotion) (gunshots firing) - Hold it, boys. Hold it. Hey, you down there. Can you hear me? - I hear you, what do you want? - Now listen... You come on out of there and bring that family of yours with you. Get on that horse of yours and ride clear out of the state. Then we won't have to come in and kill all of you. - No deal. This is my land. You has come into my 40 acres and a mule! No redneck peckerwood is gonna take it from me. - To hell with the US government, do you hear? We fly the Confederate flag over this state, and ain't no nigger ever gonna own one inch of it. Now you've got five minutes to come on out of there, or we're gonna come in and get you. Then they'll have to carry you out. Red, you go around to the rear. Steve, you go and cover him. - Boss, boss. - What's a matter with you? You scared of that nigger down there? - It's not the nigger down there boss, it's this one up here. - What are you talking about? (intense instrumental music) Stand back, you yellow bellied coward. No black belly slave got the nerve to shoot a white man. - If I have to shoot, it's gonna be right between the eyes. - No slave is that good. I say we take him. - You honkies want this land? - I say that no ex-slave will ever own one grain of dirt in this state. - All right, boys. In a few seconds, you better march your horses and ride out of here. Otherwise, you better make a move. - Stay where you are. - The only way you honkies are gonna get this land is to be buried on it. (gunshots firing) - Lord have mercy. Thanks, friend. I guess that'll take care of those scum. - Yeah, well, for now. But there'll be others. - Say, you're pretty good with those shooting miles. Where you from? - No place special. Guess I'll be moving on. - Sorry, I didn't get the name. - My friends call me Deadwood Dick, but my enemies call me Smart Black Nigga. - It's about suppertime, care to eat before you move on? - No thanks, ma'am. Good day. (western country music) (relaxing instrumental music) - Hey, baby. - Hey, I missed you! - Oh, I missed you too sugar. Right on. Hey, Snake. What you been sliding into, man? - Same old crap, my man. (laughing) - I hear you, I hear you. - Oh, Marco's up there guarding the Doctor's pad. - Yeah, I had to leave him up there, man, so I could get down with you people, man. - Yeah, right on. - How things been in Meadow Park, man? - Hey, like a cool breeze whispering into Meadow Park, man. What's happening? - We're here, you know. - I heard you had knocked some white heads together up there last night. - Yeah, just some third grade punks, man. Wasn't nothing. Hey, what's been happening here? - Same old jive, my man. Complaints, complaints, and more complaints. - Yeah, a woman called today and said the meat she bought this week was more rotten than the meat she bought last week. - Did you tell her to go to another market? - That's it, she did. (laughing) Forget this. - A dude called then and said the contract that he has on his used car was so complicated that it would take 10 CPAs to figure it out. - Tell him to bring it in? - Yeah, he made an appointment, you know. - Yeah, yeah, they do that. - Mr. Abar? How are you? - [John] Oh, Mr. Dudley. What brings you to the hornet's nest? - A stinging. - Yeah, well you're like a bumblebee in my mouth, pierce their ears, like the torch they put under your ass to get you down here. (laughing) - Your impotence, Mr. Abar, may cause you a great deal of trouble. - I'm used to trouble, man. - There are those who feel that your mouthing will stir up trouble in the ghetto and cause the blacks to riot again. There's talk that government support for our programs may be withdrawn. - Now that worries you, doesn't it, Dudley? I mean you know and I know that those programs ain't work worth a damn. The man who that money was supposed to go to stands empty handed. - Abar. How ridiculous. Where do you think all the money went? - I'll tell you where the money went. It was siphoned off the top by the top men up there, after that, there was nothing left. - Nothing but some broken down pool tables, some chalk, and some jive coloring books. - Man, in other words, to restrict black youths from burning down white institutions. That you succeeded in doing, and the black brothers, along with whitey, administrators of those programs didn't do too bad either. - Are you insinuating-- - I'm not insinuating anything. You black politicians don't give a damn about what's happening to the black man's needs. - I feel that there is a political solidarity for the good of the blacks. Well represented by blacks in city hall. - Not there man, but here. What we want is you politicians to come into our homes, our neighborhoods, see and listen to our cries. Not sit up there in city hall or the state's capital, listen to the echo from the ghetto. Like that ain't doing us no good man, so what do we do from here, huh? - Like most others, you have your 35 or 40,000 dollar a year job, your kids in a private school, and two or three cars in your driveway. - Yeah, well you're a big man when you stroll out among our people, aren't you? - Yeah, but you're not gonna rock the boat. So where do we go from here? - That's a very good question, Mr. Abar. You should hear what Thoroughbreds or the Triple XR has to say about it? - Triple X who? - Really, Mr. Abar? Don't you know that science is now in the computer stage? Now good day, Mr. Abar. - Yeah, I could see where head is at. Computerized Uncle Tom. (laughing) You jive! - [Man] Dozin' off to town. - Mrs. Kincade, I think it would be to your best interest if you could convince your husband to leave Meadow Park. - You mean to your best interest, don't you? - It's inconceivable that a man could turn down the amount of money he's offered him. - You don't know my husband very well. - There's also talk that they're going to cut out the monies that he uses for his private research. - Well, good afternoon, Mr. Dudley. I trust I haven't kept you waiting too long. - Not at all, Doctor. Your wife is a very interesting conversationalist, and we were just discussing a few pertinent points. - Yes, I heard, about my craft. - Ah that's merely talk, I wouldn't pay too much attention to that. - Ken, they wouldn't. - I feel that it's Mr. Dudley who's worried about my idea, and not about my grant. But about his political position. - A bit presumptuous, aren't you Doctor? - Well, am I do presume that you did, or did not make a call on a Mr. Abar about his preachings in the ghetto? - [Dudley] Well, how did you know about that? - I also know there's people like you who can afford to ride into Mach fours, the administrators of our poverty programs. I also know that such programs give out children inferior trading and trumped up trade schools, useless painting and molding classes, saw Congo drums and contemporary dances, Shakespeare and many other useless things. While the top men send people like you around to threaten others. - Threaten, Dr. Kincade? - Yes, threaten. You can tell those fatheads of yours that they can keep you on a leash. And out of pity, Mr. Dudley, I will come by every now and then and throw you a bone to remind you of the ass kissing dog you really are. Now good day, Mr. Dudley. - Okay, Doctor. - Darling, you're beginning to sound like Abar. - Dad, I had a dream last night that some bad dudes were chasing you on a horse. - And he said you're trying to protect the house. - It was right after Lincoln freed the slaves. - Oh? - And we were surrounded by all these bad white dudes, then the baddest black cowboy in the west, Deadwood Dick, comes and kills them all. (chuckles) - Daddy, what is it to be black? - To be black is to be beautiful, but beautiful from the essence. We are the wise men who come bearing the gift of our indispensable humanity. The dream that one day little children will play, and grow, and live, together like the princes of the earth. (crickets chirping) - [Martin Luther King] I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification. (crowd cheers) One day right down in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls and sisters and brothers. I have a dream today. (crowd cheers) (ominous instrumental music) - You better run, you jive honky! (tires screech) - Oh my God! (dramatic instrumental music) - Murderers! Murderers! That what you all are! Cowards! Cowards! You all killed my son! How can anyone kill a child just because his skin is black? (dramatic instrumental music) (somber instrumental music) - Honey. What can I say? Believe me, if I had known, God knows if I had known anything like this would've happened-- - Ken, you knew this would happen sooner or later. You knew something tragic would happen. - Please Bess, try not to think about it. - I've pleaded with you to take us away from this place, but no. You wanted to deal with racists and bigots the way you do with one of your patients. You asked for time to find the answers, answers that others before you couldn't find. Now look what happened. I've lost my child. Now, do you have the answers to bring him back? - Bess, that was my son and I loved him too. But how was I to know that-- - What did you expect when they found out that we were black? Coming in, throw their arms around us with love and kisses? How could I stay here? Now Ken, who's next? You, me, Debbie? Or are you still looking for answers? - Bess, everything you say is true. Tommy's life was a great price to-- - Please, Ken. Don't start in about where does the black man draw the line. There is no line when your child has been murdered. A senseless murder just because his skin was black. Is Abar right? Are we trying to lose our identity? - Well, perhaps they have it on their conscience. - Conscience? We are still talking about sick people. And after what has happened do you expect us to continue to live here? Ken, when will you have had enough? What are you waiting for, to blow up this house, or burn it down? - Please, Bess. Don't persecute me. - What is it that you're so obsessed with that the slaying of your own child can't drive you out of this house? Ken, if you don't change your mind about leaving this house, I'm taking Debbie and I'm leaving you. - But you can't leave now. (mysterious instrumental music) Behavioral characteristics of subject could go in several directions. Madness of the head flow, unusual high qualities, that of a saint. (mysterious instrumental music) - Tell us, good Doctor, how does it feel living in that palatial home bought by the poor black folks here. (whistling) - Get out of my yard, you little nigger you! (loud screaming) - What is it that you're obsessed with that the slaying of your own child can't drive you out of this house? (phone rings) - Hello? Hi, Mr. Abar. This is Debbie. How's Daddy? No, she went to the store. Soon. He collapsed? (mysterious instrumental music) - Did you enjoy the movie? - I thought you said you were gonna stay in bed and rest? - No time for rest now, Mr. Abar. - I called your wife before I left for the movies. - Did you? - She wasn't there, but I did talk to Debbie. - Very considerate. And what did you think of the film of Dr. King and the march on Memphis? - It was ugly. - Gruesome is a more appropriate term for that event. So you say you admired Dr. King. - Admired him, I loved him. - Was it he who inspired you into the streets to, as they say, do your thing? - Greatly inspired, Doc. - Mr. Abar. Come this way. Well I too was greatly inspired by Dr. King. And though non-violence isn't ideal to achieve, however, it is my theory it will take a strong, positive force to counteract the evil of violence. - [John] Yeah, I can dig it. - Yes, well, you've accused me of being a bourgeois black, unconcerned about the plight of our black brothers, not so. I moved here to become more obscure from friends and neighbors dropping by. - You mean socially? - As precisely. At times I even welcomed living in prejudice communities. I had to be very careful that no one would suspect what I was accomplishing. If my formula had gotten into wrong hands, it could be disastrous for mankind. - [John] Formula? - Yes, well, oh I know you don't understand, but here, ironically, amidst these intimidations, I became more and more inspired to complete my work. Even the death of my son gave me a greater drive. - But you were the inspiration to the black community. Here your life is in danger. - Well, did Dr. King leave the south when he was beset by intimidation, sat on by ruthless men, bent upon his extinction, spat on at those infamous lunch counters, dragged off to jail? - But in our community, you would be safer, Doc. - [Ken] Mr. Abar, the relative safety of the ghetto would stifle my integrity, overshadow a dream into lethargy, and complacency, but here, Mr. Abar, here amidst these palatial jaws of hell I've completed my work. Bizarre, perhaps. But it's my reality, my code for existence. - [John] Say man, what does that have to do with the prevention of heart disease? - More to do with man's mind and heart is what I've been trying to perfect for years, and that's where you come in, Mr. Abar. I've been watching you and observing you to see whether you qualify as a candidate for my experiment. - Candidate? You said I didn't have heart disease, Doc, that I was in perfect health. - And indeed you are. I must apologize for deceiving you into believing that your physical examinations had to do with my examinations into heart disease. - Say man, what are you getting at? - You claim to have so much concern for the black man's problems, if you could, how much would you be willing to sacrifice yourself? - Hey, look. As I've said over and over again, as a black race, let's get ourselves together, in every respect. For that I'll sacrifice anything short of murder. - Well, suppose I could make you indestructible. What would you say? - [John] I'd say you had your head in those test tubes too long and you should be on a funny farm. (gunshot fires) (gunshots fire) - Would you be afraid to go along with my experiment? - What if it fails? - Well, then you would have died for a worthy cause, but I assure you, it won't. - You know I don't believe this, Doc. - Well, this is the serum that did it. Interested? - Maybe. But I'm not gonna be your guinea pig, Doc. - Oh, you are afraid. - Well, let's just say I believe in living for the causes, and not dying for them. - How easy it is to die, Mr. Abar? - You gonna shoot me, Doc? - No, I won't shoot you. But for the good of mankind-- - No. - What about the-- - No. No, no, no! - You know what you are? You're a fake. Oh, I know your kind. You're in which needs to feed of off causes for your already overblown up ego. Your kind is worse than the black bourgeois escapees, scavengers living off the corruption of mankind. Oh, you scream clean up the ghetto, and if they did, you'd be the first one to soil its fragrance to keep you upon that pedestal and look at me, everybody. - Man, you've got nerve. - Yes, I have nerve. But you play it safe by living, and rapping, and acting out to concede off of a nothing crusader. - And I don't have to take this. (gunshots firing) - Abar. Not that way. Why bring yourself down to the level of those scums? Nothing will ever hurt you! Supreme master of every situation, I stake my reputation upon it. The greatest human ever! - I don't wanna be great, man. Don't you understand that? I'm sick and tired of people being pushed around. I'm sick to death of whitey, and I'm sick to death of you. You think I'm brave, don't you? Strong. Well I've got a weakness, Doc. Passion. Sometimes I wanna kill. Kill, kill! - No use. They're probably gone by now. I better take this. - [Martin Luther King] Every now and then, I guess we all think realistically. We would be victimized with what is life's final common denominator, that something would be called death. We all think about it, and every now and then I think about my own death, and I think about my own funeral, and I don't think about it in a morbid sense. I tell them not to mention that I have three or four hundred other awards, that's not important, tell them not to mention where I went to school. - [Ken] What are you doing? - This is what you wanted me to do for the good of mankind, stay away from me, man. - No, no, no, I was mistaken about you. You're not the right man for such a tremendous responsibility. - Get out of my way. (dramatic instrumental music) - Ken, what is wrong? Are you all right? - Yes, I'm all right, it's Abar. - Abar? Somebody tried to kill him? Oh Ken, please come in with me. Debbie misses you, and so do I. - Bess, I'm afraid I have unleashed the most horrible being that could lead to the destruction of many, and God knows what else. - What are you talking about? - Bess, listen. That greatly held secret of mine, the greatest scientific achievement ever known to mankind is about to become a frightening nightmare. - Ken, what is it? - I've created a superhuman. - Superhuman? Is that why all the mystery and-- - Yes! The risk of someone finding out was too great to allow to get in the hands of the wrong person. - What has this to do with Abar? - Too late I discovered he had an emotional problem. It could lead to madness. I got three hours before the serum takes in effect. My God, I didn't realize he was psychopathic. - Are you gonna kill him? - Yes, before he becomes some kind of monster. Bess, please go back to Jim's house. (funk instrumental music) - Yeah. He was here over an hour ago looking for Abar. I haven't seen Abar, what's wrong? - I don't know. But his wife came over and said that Ken was out looking for Abar with a gun. She said he's gonna kill him. - What are you talking about, why? - I don't know, he must be crazy, I got to find him. - Hey, wait! (funk instrumental music) - [Man] Hey fellas, the Doc's out looking for Abar to kill him. - [Other Man] Come on, let's ride. (funk instrumental music) - [Man] What it is? - [Other Man] We've gotta find Abar, man. - [Man] Let's get it on then, brother. - [Other Man] Let's move. (funk instrumental music) (sirens blaring) - Freeze, nigger! Pete, he's got a gun. (gunshots firing) - Damn Joe, this guy doesn't even have a gun on him. - It's all right, I can take care of that. (radio chatter) - I saw that plant. - Well you see a little bit too much. Hey, you're that Abar fella that's been causing all that trouble in the ghetto, right? We got one of these for you. (gunshot firing) Get after him! 13843, request ambulance and assistance, 47th and Avalon, rear alley. Supervisor code two please, 10-4. Hey, sir! Back here. This Abar character, he shot a man. Hey, back here. My partner's in the pursuit of him. - Okay buddy, move on. - I'm a doctor. - All right, let him on him. Come on. - Brother. - Oh my God. He is mad. - Hi, Sarge. Lost him in the dark. (somber instrumental music) (thunder booms) (funk instrumental music) - Go tell Abar's girl we found him. Check and make sure the Doc isn't here. (funk instrumental music) Say man, you gonna rap to us? - Beware of the pigs, man. (funk instrumental music) - [Police Officer] I said freeze! - Abar. You're under arrest. Tell your men to throw down their arms. - Abar, take cover! - Hey baby, you want those pigs to waste you? - Dead those stupid pigs, let's get them! - Yeah, let's get them! - Yeah man, it's either them or us. - You've got 30 seconds before we commence firing. - Hey Dad. Looks like Abar's on a trip. - Commence firing! (gunshots firing) I said fire! - I'm going home to my wife. Make love, not war. - Make what? Come back here! - Ah, who the hell you always giving orders to anyway? - I said fire! - Give me that gun. - We're out here trying to get our promotions. - That's right, I think you're a lousy cop, you Aunt Jemima, Uncle Tom... (loud commotion) - Come on, let's get outta here. (laughing) (loud commotion) (strange ambient music) (explosion booms) (funk instrumental music) (loud commotion) - Give me my stuff. What's wrong with you? - You guys are fighting over the wine, just give it to me! - Don't take my wine. Please, don't take my wine. Take my life, don't take my wine. (funk instrumental music) - Help, help, help, help, help, help my purse, my purse, he's taken my purse, he's taken my purse, my purse! Oh, the guy's taken my purse. - Police, police! (loud commotion) (funk instrumental music) (loud buzzing) (bell tolling) (lighthearted instrumental music) (catchy instrumental music) (band instrumental music) (birds chirping) - Oh no, man, I lost one of my biggest contracts last week. I don't believe it. Some kid outbid me by 50 dollars. 50 lousy dollars, man. - Oh you're kidding, you're kidding. - Nah uh, man. Say, I understand that the county made a quite of number of programs in the ghetto. How's it like in your district? - I'm not concerned about the blacks in the ghetto. Hey man, we have it made here. To hell with the blacks in the ghetto! (strange ambient music) - Maggots! Where'd they come from? - [Dudley] What the hell is this? - So you think he's some kind of devil? Well I'm afraid it's entirely out of my hands. Oh I see, told you. No, no, I don't think that would be wise. That's too bad but... That was Dudley. I must've been mad to have dreamt ip that damnable formula. - [John] I'm curious to know why-- - Why I didn't take the potion? - [John] Yes. - My heart wouldn't have withstood its tremendous shock. - I see. Now you have regrets. - Well, I don't know. I must admit however, that your performance at the towers was quite remarkable. - [John] Yes, I was aware of you and your brother being there. - I wanted to destroy you. - Yes, I know that too. Let me straighten your mind, put it at ease, about the man in the alley. It was the police that killed him, and you can take my word for it. Doctor, you foolishly assumed it was me. - How do you know? - By psychic powers. You see, the potions released from my soul an ancient wisdom, which is presently to be used. - What do you intend to do with your power? - My powers are of a divine origin. - Are you of a divine nature? - I can assure you I am. - And Dudley's talking about committing suicide, and you're responsible? - It isn't I, it's the man himself. He's self facing self. - Well, how does the power of yours supply? - I'm only a tool, Doctor. A mirror, reflecting man onto himself. By control of the mind I can hasten the retributive forces lodged in his unconscious mind. - Oh. I had suspicions it would work that way. I take it you can also control the elements in man's environment. - Yes. And that way I can accelerate the process of man facing his own evil, and good as well. - Well, I'm beginning to see what you mean. Well, now we must try... Something wrong? (clock ticking) - No, no. To further relieve you, Doctor, if I misuse these powers, they can turn against me. - Misuse, well, how? - Selfish gains, personal power. - Well, well how will that effect you? - A temporary loss of power and its devastating reactions. It's in the nature. Anyway, I must leave. - Oh no, there's much to... - I'll be back. Your house is about to be blown to smithereens. (clock ticking) (funk instrumental music) (explosion booms) (winds swirl) - Rats, my God, rats! My house is infested with rats! (rats squeaking) Rats! (thunder booming) (screaming) - Ah, it's a snake! (thunder booms) - Somebody help me, please! Help me! Please. Oh, someone help me! Oh please. - I was out in my yard trying to rake up some leaves, and this hurricane came out! I tried to get my house, it was like a thousand volts. - Bees, bees, my house is full of bees! (loud commotion) - I can't believe it! My whole house is infested with rats. (loud commotion) - I have a boa constrictor in my bed, I don't know who put it there! - I got electrocuted when I tried to open this car door! - My car won't start, he tried to open it up... (loud commotion) (winds swirling) - Doctor and Mrs. Kincade. I want to apologize for the way I behaved when you moved into Meadow Park. The reason I didn't want you to live next door to me is because... I'm black and I've bene passing as white all these years and-- - Yes, I know. The doctor told me you were suffering from sickle cell anemia. - Can you ever forgive me? - [Martin Luther King] I have a dream that my poor little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. I have a dream that one day, every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania. Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado. Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that, let freedom ring from the Stone Mountain of Georgia. Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee. This is our hope. This is the faith that I will go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. We will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, "Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!" (crowd cheers) (gunshot fires)
