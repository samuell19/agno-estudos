It's-- It's, uh… It's a more sort of relaxed way of… Way of living, a more carefree way of living, whereas in England, there's a lot of pressures. And, um, the-the music in Jamaica tends to reflect the mood of the country. And, um, maybe, that's why it's been so successful because it's reflecting a particular mood which, um, British reggae isn't doing because British reggae isn't coming under the same influences as, um, the reggae being produced in Jamaica. Um, well, the main difference is-is the obvious one. Uh, that… English reggae is not a term that I like using, really, because it's all reggae. Uh, but, um, the main difference is that English reggae is played by musicians that live in England. And that is the only difference. I mean, the very name reggae. I mean, it wasn't called reggae in the first place. It came from blue beat, just ska, you know? Ska and blue beat, the era, and then reggae. Because it was a dance, originally. The DJs thought, "That's a nice name," and they kept saying "reggae music, reggae music" on the air all the time. Reggae music, reggae music, the DJs on the radio. So everyone kept on saying reggae music. -They classed it as-- -Reggae. -Reggae. -Reggae. Reggae. Originally, reggae was a dance.

Like they just refuse to play it. The only time they play it is when it's, uh… When it's in the chart. You know, like it… Like it accidentally gets in the charts and they play it. You know, but general promotion, like what they do with other music, like, they'd get a new release and they'd just automatically play it, they don't do that with reggae. -[interviewer] Why not? -Um… it comes right back to what, um… What reggae music is dealing with, I think. You see, the truth. Certain truth they don't want to be known. I mean, the establishment, right? Because we've got… It's-it's much higher than, uh, a couple of people just making decisions on what records to play. The content of the music has got a lot to do with it. Now, there's a lot of things that, uh, the system that set up the BBC don't want to be known. [interviewer] Do you think it's a kind of racism? Yeah, well, obviously it comes down to that, too. You know, but I wouldn't, um… Wouldn't really say it's out and out racism, -if you understand what I mean. -Mm-hm. [man] But, um… [clicks tongue] that has got something to do with it, yes. You've got like, uh, a set of men then who, uh… Who control the whole thing, right? And their aim in controlling the whole thing is to keep the masses down, right? Now, um, reggae music is dealing with the freedom of the masses, not only Black people, you know, all people. So, um, those views, they don't want to be known. What's going on really is exploitation, you know? 'Cause you have a whole lot of singers, even like myself, who have been around long time and who have done a many good recording. And yet, still… They're still suffering, you know? It's like there's only one-one person who, in the world, let's say, as someone who is-- Who is dealing with reggae. But there's a lot more good people who have been stifled, who have been boycott and bootleg, you know? It's a great pity because the reggae record does not get… [stammers] I might as well use this word, any airplay from British radio or any radio. The reggae records that get played from our own disco, which we call sound system… Sound system has done… miracles for reggae music. We got these called dubs, acetates, right? [interviewer] Right. [man] Some people say they want, um, 30 pound, 25 pound. They get… Sometime, we get four, you know? Two on each side. -All different versions, you know? -[interviewer] And whom are they made for? From DJ's sound systems. [man] A sound system is a… Is, uh… Is, um, expensive hobby. That's the first thing that anyone wants to know. [child babbling] And sound system is ours, so, uh… Uh, entertainment, I think that White folks call mobile-- Mobile discothèque… Right? Incensed. Whereas the Black people, it was originate. Sound system was originated in Jamaica. And we take all that we saw in Jamaica and-and brought it to England, the idea to England, and we built up and we decided to work from there, you understand. Also, sound system is a very good thing for England, because it teaches Black and White to mix, you understand. I mean, we as sound system men, we play for the poor class people, people who can't afford to pay big monies in club, to go to high clubs. Most big posh clubs in England don't allow sound system in, you understand. Because they reckon that they always feel that sound system is a thing that mix with drugs, and… you understand. And they don't want the thing and-and it's much noise, and… they can't see the good of what sound system is really doing for the country and the people. Locally, there is nowhere that the people mix in England like in the sound system dances. A lot-- A tremendous amount of Black and White, we preach peace… Peace, and love, and unity, and overstanding, you understand. -[reggae music playing] -[singing in Jamaican] ♪ The best thing in life Is for free, yeah ♪ [singing in Jamaican] ♪ From Jamaica way To Germany down to Canada ♪ [singing in Jamaican] ♪ King David, he was a Black man ♪ ♪ King Solomon, he was a Black man ♪ ♪ King Moses, he was a Black man ♪ ♪ South Africa, yeah ♪ [singing in Jamaican] It's simply… [chuckles] …just controlling this.

Well… -[man] Reggae music-- Reggae music mean… -[laughs] That's an influence. Reggae music mean Rastafari. Herb. Right? Um, Rastafari, herb. Where's-where's the third one? And the reggae music itself is like God, the Father, and the Son. So reggae music, herb. Right? And Rastafari. That's what it mean. [interviewer] Can you tell me more about Rastafari, herb? Well, you see, Rastafari itself is a spiritual thing, it's… Rastafari mean God. And the music itself, reggae music, are part of it and I believe it's easy, right? Uh, it's more spiritual. Most of the things we believe come from the Bible. See, so if you link it still, the herb is for meditation. And when you are meditating, you can see wide, on a wider scope. And you, you can see wide, you can see God. And you, you can't see God. The only way of getting to God is to put a tune to the music, and it's called reggae music. The words of our songs are usually, um… They usually come by inspiration, you know? It's a spiritual thing. It's a guiding force that I think gives us the words, maybe a bit strong. Most people like to say "the power" because people don't like to say "God." They look at God as an image. But, uh, I think it's a spiritual thing and it comes by inspiration. We deal with love, and unity, and spiritual awareness at the same time. People getting to know themselves and living together. And we also deal with truths and rights, what is right.

Not always, but, I mean, they sing about love, you know? But it seems just natural, things that are happening. And that's reggae music, it's so realistic. Right now, we have got a lot of doctrine.

But when I have a dread on my head, you see, a dread, no, is a true identity. And I said before, you don't have to rock locks up here to say Rastafari because your heart… Your dreadlock is a true identity. A lot of people don't like the-the dreadlocks because… They'll feel shill when certain people see island dreadlock, but this is-- It just-- This is what really… These dreadlocks, this is what wearing free Black people, and this is what will keep Black people together, because Rastaman deal with peace, love, and unity, and also repatriation. Because we are from somewhere. I and I originate from Africa. Not England or America or Canada. Some of us say we're from America, Canada, and stuff like that, but no, I and I originate from Africa. I'm not really Rastafari, but I've got respect for it. 'Cause it sort of, um… It deals with, um, Black awareness as well. And, uh, it makes me want to know the past, my past history so I could build my future. I really… There's one thing I'd like, would be the Black youths or the Black people of this country, all over this country, but sure, the whole of Europe, and build up a Babylon, as we call it. You know, come together. And to know that, um, that is our destination, Africa is my destination. 'Cause that's what we are… We are going because that's where we originated from, you know? And I'd like for sort of brothers and sisters to come together as one and start with peace and love. So, of course, no fight, no animosity among themselves, you know? [speaks in Jamaican] I feel that Black man all means like man of the world. That means everybody's supposed to belong to me, and supposed to belong to everybody as well because God is the man who controls everything. -You know what I mean? -Yeah. So, Germany belong to me as well. -[laughter] -That's funny.

You know, when the Klan actually came to Britain as well. And many people sort of thought that we put this single out just to react to the Klan's, uh, arrival in Britain. But the song was actually written a year before they came. You know what I mean, so it didn't get much airplay because of the subject matter. You know, they couldn't have banned it because when you ban records, well, in England, it sort of gets more publicity and more, uh, sales. So they just didn't play it as often as they should. -They ignored it. -They ignored it. Yeah. [interviewer] And what are the songs dealing with, most of your songs? Well, one was just dealing with just, um, a Black man's personal feeling towards the Klan, like saying, um, how we can just be just walking down the road, doing nothing, and suddenly just get attacked like that. That's what it was dealing with, and the conclusion it came to, in the song that, well, we cannot really put up with any more of this sort of thing. And we just sort of, uh, should fight back. [interviewer] Your first album is titled "Handsworth Revolution." Can you please tell me something about Handsworth and living there? Well, it's one of the places that papers and people outside Handsworth regard as being a big ghetto, right? They regard it as a place where you can't walk down the street after dark, and there's loads of Black youths out of work, and they don't want to work anyway. And in general, it's a bad place, you know. If you go somewhere and they know about Handsworth, they regard it as a bad place, somewhere you drive through rather than stop. But we all live there, right? And we know a completely different story than the story that's put out. And that's one of the reasons why we've titled the LP "Handsworth Revolution," because revolution should start there. It's not what people are making it out to be. And people are not… You know, they don't avoid work the way the papers print. They avoid work, they don't want to know, and they're not all troublemakers, and they are-- There's a reason for it all. You know? But the reason's never said. So that's what we're on about, basically. [interviewer] What do you think is the reason? -The reason? -[interview] Yes. The reason's the whole system. It goes all back. I mean, it's like you got a guy who leaves school, right? To begin with, they're teaching him all bullshit at school. Lot of nonsense, right? He leaves school, and then, he goes and looks for a job, right? He goes to countless amount of interviews, he doesn't get a job, so at the end of the day, he's fed up, right? They stick him on the dole. He can't get a job because they don't really want him to work, right? And he's on the dole, and after being on the dole for a while, they cut him off, right? And in this place, you can't live without money, so he's got to get money from somewhere. And then they blame him if he was to go and pinch or steal from someone when he's got no obvious alternative.

Go there with a completely blank mind, and then the things will come out to you, rather than treat it the way you'd treat general pop music or whatever. And you got to bear in mind that in the background of most, if not all reggae, it stems from suffering, and there's somebody crying out in this record or whatever. And if-- And if you can't understand the lyrics, watch the aggression in the person's face, the expression and how he feels towards what's going on. And then you'll have a rough idea of what's happening. -Yeah, and you-- -What he's saying. You got to always seek into where this person's coming from and what he's done in the past, and you get a better picture of what is he saying or singing about, a better picture about reggae, 'cause reggae is suffering, basically. -And it's truth as well. -[chuckles] -Reggae is strictly truth. -Yeah. No politics in reggae. [chuckles] It's either that or two million politicians in Jamaica. [laughter] And I don't think there's two million politicians in Jamaica.
