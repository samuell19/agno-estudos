[♪♪♪] Subtitle Modified by : SDR [doorbell rings] [gasps] For me? Thank you! Thank you. Merry Christmas. Huh. ♪ Ho, ho, ho [chuckles] ♪ Who wouldn't go ♪ Ho, ho, ho Who wouldn't go? ♪ ♪ Up on the housetop Click, click, click ♪ ♪ Down through the chimney with Good St. Nick ♪ [♪♪♪] [chuckles] [♪♪♪] Ooh, use all the lights we've ordered. We want this place to sparkle. Oh, hi. Looks great. Keep it up. Ooh, when the booths are done, let's make sure we wrap garland around every post. After all... [sighing happily] it is Christmas. [♪♪♪] Meg, can you make sure the movie screen is being delivered today? I need it on-site at 4:00 p.m. On it. You're awesome, thanks! Hi. Hey. Ooh... Mmm, so good! Have you tried one? I have, yeah. They're set up at Booth 18. Great. So, did you get my... special delivery? Uh-huh. [laughs] Did you know it plays a song? [chuckling] Yeah. I hope the card wasn't too corny. No. No, it was sweet. You know, the thing is... It's just, you know, we work together, so... well, it's probably best if we stay colleagues. Or friends. I would love to be friends... Oh, hey, you know, say no more. I get it, yeah. And I agree, actually. You do? Yeah, yeah... Which reminds me, I gotta go call the... the dog adoption guys. Okay. Hey. [sighing] Wow. [sighing] Ted just got redder than he does from one of his jogs. I know. He asked me to dinner, and I said no. Oh, don't look at me like that. I know, he's really nice, and super sweet. But it's just... I know, I know. Chloe... Hi, Elaine. I just got off the phone with our councilman, and the city is so impressed with the work that you've been doing on the fair. Keep it up, huh? Oh, and by the way, my kids are over the moon about your idea with the skating rink. They can't wait. Great! You got this. [both squealing in triumph] [laughing] Ooh, did I tell you, we're going to have a tree farm at the fair? So I can get our tree there. Wow, you have thought of everything for this event. Including a date for the Christmas ball, I hope. If not, you know Sean, you know, my favorite teller at the bank, who's single and keeps asking about you? I'll be working the ball. Besides, I've decided, no more dating. Why on earth not? Because... when you're not looking, that's when it happens. What happens, exactly? You know, you meet the one, the one who rocks your world and sets off all the lights and the fireworks in your head. Uh-huh, so... while you're waiting for all these lights, how are you going to get them if you're not dating? Because, Mom, it'll happen when I meet him. Chloe, honey, it doesn't always happen like that. Sometimes the lights go on after you've gotten to know somebody. And then sometimes, there are fireworks when you meet somebody, and then it just kind of fades. Like you and Dad? All I'm saying is give someone a chance. [sighing] [bells jingling] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Hey, can we get a timer so the rink lights go on and off automatically? Thanks! You my, friend, are a genius. I mean, look, everyone loves this. [sighs] And the elf marshals? Wonderful. Right? Are you going to skate? What? No! The last time I put blades on, I hit a rough patch of ice, and... Splat. Come on, you gotta give it a try. I'll be your personal rink marshal. [laughs] [♪♪♪] Okay. Steph! Good job! Steph! Whoa! Ah! Whoa! Hey... You okay? - Hi. - Hi. [chuckles nervously] You all right? Oh... Oh, I got you. Whoa! Whoo! [laughs] [yelps] Gotcha. Yeah. Do you want to, uh... Here. Whoa... You're all right. [yelps] Whoa! That was a pretty spectacular fall. I was hoping nobody noticed. I noticed as soon as you stepped on the rink. Ooh... Your rink marshal is here. Really? Now? It's okay. I gotta get going. Just, uh, hold her hand. Uh... I... So... Who was he? The man of my dreams. Who's... apparently taken. [♪♪♪] I am so proud of you. This is gorgeous. It's like a winter wonderland here. Oh, hey! Let's get some new ornaments for the tree. Yeah. Ooh, I like this. I love this one. Love this, yeah. What do you think? Do you think it's pretty? Chloe? What? Oh yeah, beautiful. Anna? [gasps] Ah... Oh, my gosh, I don't believe it. Russ Peterson? What are you doing here? These are my gingerbread houses. Get out, you made those? I did. Oh, my gosh! With my grandmother's secret recipe. Really? Russ, this is my daughter, Chloe. Hi. Chloe helped organize this whole fair. - Oh, my gosh. - Some of it. It's beautiful. Russ and I went to high school together. Oh. Well, we did a little more than that. Oh. Like that dinner date we had? Oh, you mean the one where you didn't have enough money to pay the bill? Yeah, I didn't want your mother to know, so I went and found the manager, and asked if I could come back later and make up the difference, and he had me scrubbing these huge industrial pots. I'm sorry, I'd forgotten about that part. You were worth it. Oh, well, uh, Chloe and I were just about to go get our tree. Oh, I can do it. Why don't you guys stay and catch up? That'd be great. When the booth closes, I could maybe... buy you coffee? I have the money now. [laughs] Are you sure you don't mind? Not at all. Have fun. Really nice meeting you, Russ. You too, Chloe. Bye. Bye. [♪♪♪] Oh, sorry. - Hi! - Hi! It's you! Yeah. [laughs] Um, I was just here checking out the blue spruces. They're my favorite. I absolutely agree. So, are you picking out a tree too? I am. For my sister and niece. Oh, your sister? Yeah, that's right. Yeah, she told me under no circumstance get a big tree, so I'm looking for a ten-footer, at least. [laughs] Uh, was your... was your sister at the rink? Yeah, you might have seen me with her. Hmm... Yeah, I don't know. Maybe. So, are you in town visiting your sister with your family, or...? Uh, No. No family. No. Just me. Oh. I'm Evan, by the way. - Chloe. - Hi. Hi. Uh... So are you picking out a tree for someone special? [scoffs] No. Well, yeah. My mom. She's on her own, like me, so, uh... I get the tree every year. That's nice. Yeah. [message alert chimes] Oh, no. Everything okay? One of the dogs escaped from the adoption booth. I'm sorry, I have to go help find it. I'm actually a bit of a dog whisperer, so I could help. Really? Uh... but what about your tree? Oh, um... Excuse me, sir? Can you hold the biggest tree you've got? Sure. I'll come back. Let's go. Okay. [laughs] [message alert chimes] Good boy! Okay, they say his name is Dasher. Sounds appropriate. Yeah. So, what do you think, should we start at Santa's Village? I'm ready. [chuckling] Okay. Be good! What do you want for Christmas? Dasher? Dasher! [kissing and whistling] - Here, boy! Dasher! Ho, ho, ho! Sorry, Santa, not that Dasher. Dasher, here, boy! [kissing and coaxing] Dasher! Oh! There he is. What? Watch this. Dasher... [kissing and calling] Come here, boy... Mmm... This is good. So good. [whistling nonchalantly] [gasping] Hey, buddy. Hey. Here. Pass me the leash? Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy. Hey... You were hungry, weren't you? Yeah, you were. Ooh... gotcha. [chuckling] Aw, buddy... There you go. I hope you find your forever home soon. He's pretty handsome in that sweater. I think he will. Yeah. Hey, what about you, dog whisperer? I would, but, uh, my job doesn't allow me to have pets right now. What about you? Oh, I would love to, but my building has a no-pet policy. Which I have been lobbying against for over a year now. Oh. Well, something tells me you're gonna win. Well... thank you. I'm happy I could help. Me too. I should, uh... Yeah. Sorry! Whoo! [chuckling awkwardly] Actually, you know what, um, do you want to grab a cider or something? Yeah, I'd love to. Cool. Be good! See you, Dasher. Thanks. Cheers. - Cheers. So, uh, how did you know where to find the best cider in the fair? You have an inside source? Kind of. I work for the company that helped plan this. Really? Mm-hmm. You've done an amazing job. [chuckles] Um, what about you? Besides being a dog whisperer? Um... I sell these. Our company also makes parkas. In fact, I dropped off about 20 at the donation center. That's so generous of you. Thank you. So, uh, you were saying earlier it's just you and your mom for Christmas, or...? Mm-hmm. Well, my parents got divorced when I was young, and my dad came around for a while, but lately it's just been me and my mom. [laughs awkwardly] Yeah, my sister Kate and her husband divorced last year. He still sees Sara on weekends, but this is the first Christmas they're not together like a family. That's why I made sure to be here. I'm sure that's going to mean a lot to them. Uncle Evan! Hey, you! Did you tell Santa what you wanted for Christmas? Wow, that's quite the tall order. Kate, this is Chloe. Hi! - Hi! This is my niece, Sara. Hey. Chloe organized this whole thing. Not all of it. Well, whatever you've done, you've done a great job. Sure has. Mommy, can we stay for the movie? Movie? It's the movie under the stars. We have a whole outdoor screen set up and hot chocolate. It's like a Christmas drive-in. Can we, please? I don't see why not. Chloe, are you going? - Oh, no, I... - You should. I mean, you don't have to work all night, too, do you? No, I'm not. [♪♪♪] [whispering quietly] [♪♪♪] Hi. Hi. Hi! Hi, cutie! Are you excited? Here, I thought we could share. Thanks. Oh! I love this one. Me too. When she sends the letter to Santa. And how all she wishes for is her dad could have a wife? I know. [sighs] It's the best. I know. [♪♪♪] [laughing] This is pretty funny. Yeah. [wind gusting] Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped this! Gorgeous, isn't it? [♪♪♪] Mm! And then, after the movie, he asked me to the Christmas ball. I mean, you know, I told him I was working, of course, so he made me promise to save him a dance. I mean, how cute is that? Like, what, like, "Ooh, do I have a dance card or something?" [laughing] And does he live near here, or does he live in another city? He has a place in New York, which is so close, and he was just about to tell me all about his new job, but then Sara got tired and she fell asleep, and he had to help take her home, but whatever, none of that matters, because it's happening. All of it. The lights, the fireworks... [laughs] I can definitely see that. And I'm so happy for you. [sighing] Thanks!

Thank you. And you look gorgeous too. Oh, are you sure? I haven't worn this dress in 10 years. You should see the way Russ was looking at you. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Hi! I was hoping you'd be here. Oh, well, I was hoping you'd be here. [chuckling] Well, I have a few things I have to tend to. You guys enjoy yourselves. Thank you. Let me know if I can help you. Wow, it looks great! Yeah. Ooh, do we have enough ice? I need to make sure it doesn't melt. Don't worry, I just checked. We got a truck parked out back filled with ice. Thank you. You look great, by the way. Thanks. So do you. I like the bow tie. Yeah? You don't think the snowflakes are a little too much? No, I love snowflakes. You know, it's a shame. After tonight, this is just going to melt. Makes me wish I had a bigger freezer. Chloe, I know we decided to just be friends, but... I figured maybe there wouldn't be any harm in... Excuse me. Harm in, uh... Wow. Do you always look this fabulous for a work event? Yeah, it's kind of how I roll. It's not, actually. My feet are killing me. Well, that's too bad, because I know I only reserved one dance, but I was kind of hoping to fill up your dance card. [laughing] [sighs] Now you can. Perfect. [message alert chimes] Sorry. Everything okay? Yeah. It's great. Let's dance.

Just glad I was able to pry my fingers off of it. [chuckles] You know, I did offer you gloves. Yeah, I'm pretty stubborn. Mm-hmm. You know, it is nice of you to think of sending it to the soup kitchen. Well, that's what Christmas is all about. Yeah, it is. This is me. Oh. Let me see... That's your apartment. How'd you know? 'Cause it stands out. [chuckles] Aw. Everything about you stands out. I'm leaving, Chloe. Huh? Uh, this transfer that I put in for a long time ago, the deadline was so close, it didn't think it would happen, and then tonight, I got the message. I'm being transferred to Oslo. Oslo? Yeah. Like... Oslo, Norway, Oslo? Like, the one that's 4,000 miles across the ocean? That's the one, and I'm leaving the day after Christmas. Ha! I know. I can't believe my luck, but the company, they need someone to oversee the new office, and I pushed for this, so... I gotta go. Are you coming back? Yeah. Yeah, like, in a year. Maybe two. I can't really say for sure. Wow. Chloe, I'm so sorry. I-I didn't expect... Yeah, no. Me... neither. So, I guess... the timing's off. Yeah. Guess so. But thank you. For giving me one of the best Christmases I've had in a very long time. Ditto. [chuckles] Good night. Good night. [♪♪♪] And what is this? [laughs] Oh... Oh, I love it. I don't have to ask who that's from. No, you don't. I do have a mystery present for you, though. - You do? - Yeah. Ooh, I found it on the front porch, and it has your name on it. Really? Yup. That's exciting. Mm-hmm. Let's see. It's from Evan. Why don't you stay in touch? Because what's the point? He's about to move halfway around the world. Besides, it was just one night. It's fine. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. [♪♪♪] Let's set up a meeting Thursday, 3:00? Great. See you then. That was the fourth call today to plan an office Christmas party. You know what, I've got a bride who wants to arrive in a horse-drawn sleigh. Can you even do that in this city? I don't know. You could try sled dogs. Chloe? Ted? A minute? Oh. - Of course. - Yeah. Well, both of you were fundamental to last year's Christmas Fair success, so this year, I'd like both of you to work together as a team and head up the event. But... that means everything falls on you. Understood? - 100%. - We're on it, yeah. Well... hop to it. We've got only four weeks until opening day. [chuckles] [splutters in disbelief] Okay, I'll call the vendors and confirm everyone. I'll take stock of last year's inventory. Great. Okay. Yeah. [chuckling] Congratulations. Thanks! I think. It's a bit overwhelming. I know someone who's not overwhelmed. He looks like a kid whose Christmas wish just came true. [♪♪♪] Okay, all the vendors are checked in, and the carolers confirmed they'll be here every evening at 6:00, starting tonight. Great. The gazebo is going up as we speak. It looks amazing. Sounds like we're ready to open. Yes, we are. [chuckles] [♪♪♪] Hi. These are selling. Yeah. Really selling. Hey, Mom. Hey, Russ. Hey. Hey. Oh, those are so cute! Isn't it? I thought it'd be a good idea if Russ made something other than just gingerbread houses. She was right. Yup. Hey, I thought you'd want to know the igloo dome is up, and you were right. It looks amazing. Thank you. Mom, Russ, this is Ted. Is this Ted? Ted, Hello. Hi. Nice to meet you. You and Chloe are the power team behind this whole thing. I'm mostly moral support. She does all the heavy lifting. What are you talking about? He's so much more organized than me. Really nice to meet you guys. Nice to meet you, too. And great gingerbread, by the way. Hey, thanks. We take credit cards. Now we do. [giggling] Stop it... Well, he's kind of adorable. Ted? Well, yeah, he's... he's sweet. Uh-huh. Well, have you ever thought of... Mom! We work together. I know. So do we. Not the same thing. Bye, guys. Bye. Ooh... Here we go! [laughing] [cheering] Yes, you got it! Hi. Wow. You picked up some mad skills while I was away. I may have been practicing. Ooh, check it out. [yelps] Whoa, careful... You okay? - [laughing] Well, it may still be a work in progress. Yeah. So you're back. I am. For now. Oh. You have to go back to Norway? Evan! Hey! Hi! I was just, uh, saving Chloe here from becoming an ice casualty. You're a knight in shining armor. Hi. I'm Raquel. Chloe. [clearing throat awkwardly] So nice to meet you. Raquel and I met at the Oslo office. That's great. And how do you two know each other? Uh, we just met... Last Christmas. She organizes... Well, he helped catch a dog. The event. Ooh, that reminds me, we have to make sure the Fall look book is ready for proofing by tomorrow. Oh, right, yeah. Your sister has wifi, right? Yes. Yeah. You're staying at your sister's? Yeah, Raquel wanted to experience an American Christmas. My family's originally from Sweden. We do things differently there. [chuckles] I bet. [cell phone vibrates] That's Montreal. They're ready for our conference call. Right. Nice to meet you. - Bye. - Uh... Evan? I'll see you around the fair? Yeah. [♪♪♪] You should have seen her in her pencil skirt and her four-inch heels. I mean, who can wear those all day? Let alone to a fair? I get it, Chloe. But the man was gone a year. A lot can happen in that time. Not for me. I mean, I still can't order the Peking duck for two. Ooh... But soon you'll be able to call yourself a godmother, and this little guy is gonna need someone to teach him how to skate. Little guy? Do you know? We're having a boy. [laughs in delight] I haven't even met him yet, and I already love little... Connor or Dylan so much. [laughs] Oh, Steph, I'm so happy for you. You have no idea! [laughs] [♪♪♪] [gasps] That's incredible. We still have a week before Christmas. The kids are gonna be so happy. [sighs] [dog barking] Shh! [barking loudly] Shh! Dasher! [barking] [sighs] You still haven't found a family? [barks] [barking] [chuckling nonchalantly] Hey, Santa, just the man I wanted to see. Ho, ho, ho, what can I do for you, my dear? Well, for starters, I never got my wish list in the mail, which made me a little nervous, because I may not have been so good, so if you could just take a minute and explain to me, uh, what may be considered naughty, versus, you know, just a misdemeanor. I'm pretty sure you're in the clear. He's right, my dear. You have nothing to worry about. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! [sighs] [Santa chuckling] So, are you, uh, avoiding me? What? No. [scoffs] Why would I do that? I'm good. Great. Great. Hey, I'm glad you like the vest. I thought it'd be a great color on you. I was going to thank you earlier, but... Oh, no, that's okay. I'm just really happy to see you. Wearing the vest. And you. Uh... Oh, yeah, Raquel. Yeah, we've only been dating for a few months. I wasn't really ready to invite her to meet the family, but, uh, you know, she can be very convincing. It's why she's so good at her job. Yeah, well, that's great. I'm sure you two make a real... power couple. Yeah. And you? You still celebrating Christmas with your mom? Oh, yeah. [sings awkwardly] ♪ Just the two of us... Like every year. Evan, I need your help. Oh, Kate, uh, you remember Chloe? Of course I do. You two were dancing like it was your last song at prom. [chuckling awkwardly] Uh, what did you need help with? Raquel. She just informed me that she's a vegan. Right. I forgot to mention that. Yes, you did. There's actually a vendor in booth nine that sells Tofurkeys. Oh. You are a life-saver. Evan, go to booth nine and fix this. I will take Sara to the games. Got it. [mouthing silently] Don't mention it. [cheering] Come on, guys! All the way back, come on! Come on, guys! [cheering] Whoo! - Come on! - Careful! Careful, come on. There we go! Yeah! Whoo! You're the winner! Okay, I'll take that. That's for you. Thank you. All right, the next guys up, come on over here, guys. So now... Chloe's gonna give you your ornament on a spoon. Careful. Yeah, watch out. This one? Careful, don't drop it. I don't know what's trickier, this or an egg. Well, you can hard-boil an egg. True. You know, I was pretty good at this game, even without the hard-boiling. Care to make it interesting? Is that a challenge? It's a challenge, but I should let you know, I'm pretty competitive. Oh, really? You know what... so am I. Fine, okay, you go to the end. We're gettin' in your race, okay? I'm gonna be on your team... Me and you, buddy, we got this! You wanna go to the other side? I'll take that. [Chloe clapping eagerly] Whoo! Okay, when I say go, we go, are we ready? Don't look at him, just look at me. Three, two, one, go! Come on, come on! [Chloe shouting] Come on! Whoo! Come on! Yes, come on, come on. Okay, you got this! Whoa! Go, go, go! [Ted calling]: Come on, go! Oh! Man! Oh, shoot! Yes! You won! Can we play? Uncle Evan, you and Raquel can be a team, and Mommy and I can be one. Sara, sweetie, I really have to get home and start baking. Chloe! Yeah? Chloe, you can play. You can be on my team. I don't know, I don't think that's a good idea. Please? Uncle Evan and Raquel will be on the other team. Honey, Raquel can't play in those heels. Oh, these are my walking shoes. I'll be fine. Great, let's play! Great! Okay. Toes on the line, guys. When I ring the bell, it's time to go. You ready? Three, two, one... Go! [ringing bell] Come on, Sara! Come on, you can do it! [crowd cheering] Come on, come on, come on! [crowd cheering] Come on! Come on, Chloe, you got this! Yeah! Come on, Chloe, you got it! Yes, I do! Come on, Chloe! You got this! Yeah! Whoo! Oh! [laughing] Yes! [laughing and cheering] I can't believe it, I won! What a fun game. What's it called? The... spoon game? Okay. There you are, congratulations. Oh, thank you. Okay. Evan, did you see? I won! I did. You did great, I know. You were so great, as always. Oh, thank you. Oh, Sara, you want my prize? Thank you. I have to, uh, go fix some things. Okay. - Okay, bye, guys. - Bye. [♪♪♪] There you are. How are you doing? I'm cool. My and my ice cream, just chillin'. [chuckling] Well, I'm glad I found you, because I wanted to ask how you would feel if I invited Russ to Christmas dinner this year? I think that'd be really great. Are you sure? Yes. Mom, he's... he's a really nice guy. He is. I'm happy for you. Thank you, sweetie. Mm-hmm. What about you? I know my daughter, and I know that she would not let an ice cream sundae survive that long. Is it that Evan guy? I saw him with some woman wearing heels that would defy gravity. Yeah. She's surprisingly really good at balance. I don't know, Mom, I guess I just thought that... if we ever came back together, we would just, you know, like, pick up where we left off, you know? It's so dumb. I mean, we didn't even date, and he's been gone for over a year. It's just... I just really thought we had something. The fireworks. Yeah. If it is meant to be, trust me, it will be. Do you remember the first Christmas you and I spent on our own? Oh, yeah. Okay, well, you refused to let me sit around and mope on the holidays, and you were absolutely right, and I'm gonna do that for you now, so you get up... - What? - Take your ice cream. - No, I'm... Yup, we're gonna go have some fun. - [groaning] - Listen to your mama.

Sorry, it's Peter. I have to take this. Hi, hi. Um... you know what, I'm gonna go see if Russ needs some help, so I will call you. Mom... no! I'll call you later, yeah. Mom! See ya! Hey, that was, uh... quite the duet. Yeah. If we ever got in an argument, we would talk all over each other. Well, I don't know about you, but I'm a little parched from all that singing. Yeah, I could use some liquids. What, like a cider, or a hot chocolate, or something? Oh... Oh, Raquel, she's talking to our boss, so... it's gonna be a while. Oh. Okay. Yeah? Mm-hmm. All right. [gasps] Do you wanna see something really cool? Uh, yeah. Okay. It's right over here. Whoa. Here we are. What is this? Well, I wanted to see if I could to recreate the northern lights right here at the Fairmont Fair. I've always wanted to see them. I saw them, this past March in Bardufoss. Norway's one of the best places in the world to see it. - No way! - You would have loved it. [gasps] What did Raquel think? Um... we hadn't met yet. Mmm. You know, I thought about you. I even googled your name. Do you know how many people come up if you google "Chloe Taylor"? Really? Hmm, I always thought I was one of a kind. You are. I even thought about writing a letter, or calling, or... But then they extended my transfer, and I just figured that, uh... 4,000 miles is a... it's a long ways away. You know, what's crazy is just standing here with you... it just feels like nothing. I should go. Yeah. But, uh... but thank you for... sharing this with me. Yeah. Hey, uh... will... will you be at the ball? I will. Bye. [♪♪♪] Hey! Is the broiler fixed yet? Great. Ooh. Mmm! These are amazing! The deejay just got here. He's setting up now. Great.

You're pregnant, and you look glowy and beautiful. I look bloated, like... like a whale. [laughs] Maybe if I just stick my hand on my tummy? That's what pregnant women do, right? Yeah, that totally works. I mean, you're definitely preggers, but... May I have this dance, my lovely wife? Aw... you keep sweet-talking me like that, and maybe I won't eat the whole dessert table. [laughs] [whispers] Good luck. [♪♪♪] Evan, let's dance, come on. [♪♪♪] They don't have an ounce of the chemistry you and Evan had last year. Yeah, well... They have something. Work, I guess.

So, you know, um, Raquel and I were dancing... Mm-hmm. And I couldn't help but remember last year, and all I kept thinking was... what a great dancer you are. Well, I've got some killer moves. [chuckles awkwardly] There you are. Always with the food. He has quite the appetite. Yeah. So I hope they have a good meal on the flight. I just got word, we have to be back early. When? Uh, we fly out in less than four hours. Just enough time to pack. Right. So I guess we gotta call it a night. Okay. Yeah. Evan? I think you should go. It was good to see you again, Chloe.

To family and friends who make the holidays so much brighter just by being here. [clinking glasses] Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Here you go. - Hey, come here. Come here. - Ah. [kissing] Thanks. [laughing] [♪♪♪] - Aw. - Aw. [laughing] [♪♪♪] Mm... [sniffing] [laughs] Okay, okay. [laughing] I'm up. Hey, Mom! How's sunny Florida? Oh, it's hotter than I imagined. Russ wore a dinner jacket last night. I think he lost ten pounds in sweat. How are things up there? Running like clockwork. Ooh, by the way, I ran into Russ's daughter yesterday, and she has everything ready for the booth. [doorbell rings] Mom, I gotta go. Hi to Russ for me. I'll see you on Christmas. Okay, honey, bye-bye! [kisses] Bye. You, stay. [kissing] Good boy. [barking] Dasher, quiet! Shh. Thank you. [barking] Oh, do you need me to sign, or... O-kay. Thank you. Bye! Really, Dasher? [chuckles] [laughs] [switching music box on] ["Jingle Bells" plays] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Well, if you want recipes, I got tons. Do you like protein bars? Oh, my gosh, I love them. Then I got a great holiday one that you're going to love. It is peppermint, cranberries, and a little bit of dark chocolate. It is amazing. Hey! Hi! Did you get my special delivery? I sure did. Thank you. And yes to dinner tonight. Great. 'Cause I already made us reservations at that new Cantonese restaurant. [gasps] Can we get the Peking duck? I've always wanted to try it. Whatever you want. Great. Hi. I don't think we've met. I'm Chloe. Tricia. Elaine hired me to fill in for the busy Christmas season while Stephanie's on maternity leave. Oh, right. Stephanie's my best friend. Oh. Yeah, and I'm actually her baby's godmother. Oh, wow. Yeah. [message alert chimes] Oh, uh, we have to go meet the ice cream company. Okay, I'll grab my coat. Great. See you later. Yeah. Mm, great idea bringing this into the festival. You know, they said they have enough for another booth if we wanted. Really? Let's put it by Santa's Village. I'm on it. Hey! Mine. Hey... How's Connor's first Christmas fair? He spat up on Santa, but at least he didn't cry. That's great. Fun time's over for us, though. It's time to go pick up the in-laws at the airport. I'm just hoping their flight's delayed, because it's right at his feeding time. Nothing says "welcome" like a screaming baby. Oh, just leave him with me. Are you sure? Don't you have, like, work to do? No, Ted's on it. Don't worry. Connor and Auntie Chloe will be all good, just as long as you have an extra bottle. I always pack one just in case. I should be back in a couple of hours. If you have any problems, call me. Thank you, you're a lifesaver. Yeah, get outta here. [cooing] Chloe? Hey! Hey, um... wow, you're... A godmother. That's it. [laughing] Or awesome auntie, as I like to call myself. Congratulations. [chuckles] Thanks. You're back. Again. I am. And who's this? Oh, this is Connor. He's pretty chill. You know, he likes milk and long walks in a stroller. Hey, Connor. Hey, buddy. So, uh, how's Raquel? Oh, she's good. She went to Sweden for the holidays... with her boyfriend. Oh. I'm sorry. It's okay. It wasn't meant to be, trust me. But, hey, uh, I started a new program with the company. As of this December, 5% of every coat sales goes to charity, and I made sure Out Of the Cold was one of the recipients. Thank you. The best part is, I'm back in the New York office, which means I'm not 4,000 miles away, just 40. Oh, hey, who do we have here? This is Evan. Oh. Hi. It's nice to meet you. And, uh, that's Connor. Well, actually, Connor and I go way back, so we don't need any introduction, right, Connor? [laughs] But it's nice to meet you, Evan. Although I've seen you before. At the ball? Oh, right, yeah. I'm a bit of a regular. [chuckling] Yeah. I'm just babysitting for Steph. She's picking up the in-laws. Oh, you play momma. I just got to wrap up a few things at the office, then I'll pick you up? Great. Okay. [kissing] And, uh, enjoy the fair. It's nice to meet you. - Take care. - Yeah. I'll see you around the fair. Sure. I guess so. [♪♪♪] [laughing] So they're not seeing one another anymore? Nope. She's got a new boyfriend. Chloe, you were crushed when he showed up last year with a girlfriend... and now he's free. And I'm not. What? Steph, I'm happy. I mean... Ted's a great guy. In fact, I should have given him a chance two years ago. But instead, I pined over some guy who just seems to come and go, so I'm sorry, but I'm with Ted now. Okay. Yeah, I figured it worked so well this year, we should just do it every year. And? Is it everything you hoped for? Chloe? Hmm? The duck. You said you always wanted to try it. It's great. So, I was thinking in the new year I'd start training for a marathon, and I was wondering, maybe you could train with me? Come on my lunchtime jogs. No, I do not run. Well, I mean, I do, but that's only after an ice cream truck. Well, maybe we could find something else to do together, other than work, of course. Yeah, of course. Um... what about horseback riding? Doesn't that sound like fun? Not really. The hay fever would be the end of me. Hay fever. Whoo! Well, we'll find something. Yeah. Ooh, try some of this with the sauce. It's so good... Is it spicy? You know I can't do spicy. No, it's fine, you'll love it. [coughing and spluttering] Oh. Oh... I'm really sorry. Hey! [wheezing] Oh, hey, Tricia! Hi. [coughing] Um, I didn't know you were having dinner here tonight. My regular Thai place around the corner is having a private event, so Lo Mein to go... [chuckling] Uh, why don't you join us? Uh... Um... Yeah, we have so much duck, it really shouldn't be for just two. If you don't mind. So, I was just telling Chloe I'm about to start training for the Fairmont marathon. Really? I just signed up for it. Really? Yeah. Is it your first one? Actually, no, I've done three halves, and this will be my second full. How do you train? Is it sprints? Do you do intervals? Well, I do a combination of both, but I pace myself at the beginning. Okay, I've read that you should train for three-quarters of the distance... [♪♪♪] Wow, Tricia knows a lot about running marathons. Yeah. Maybe you two could train together. That wouldn't bother you? No, why would it? I don't know, I guess I just thought it might make you kind of... jealous? Well, I wouldn't want you training with her all the time... - Right. - But... Here we are. Yeah, here we are. [Dasher barking inside] [barking] Oh, I should get up there. The board just ruled in favor of pets. I don't want them to regret it. No worries. Good night. What? Nosy neighbors. Oh. I'm gonna... Okay. I'll see you at work. You bet. [♪♪♪] [pen writing on paper] [incoming call chimes] Hey, Mom. Hi, sweetheart. How's the fair? Great. Even better than last year. How are you and Ted? We're good. So, any New Year's plans with Ted? Anything I should maybe get excited about? Mom, we've only been on a few dates. I don't know yet. Why not? [laughs] Because... I like Ted, he's... he's very sweet. I just... I don't know if I... You don't know if you love him? Yeah. How would I? I've never been in love. Well, I mean, I have, but that was like... "Boom, I love you, and now you're gone." Well, sweetheart, all loves are different. Sometimes there's that "boom," and then... and other times, well, it just grows. I mean, who's to say I won't... grow to love Ted? [chuckling] Well, if that's what you truly want. Thanks, Mom. You make everything clearer. [♪♪♪] [clearing throat for attention] Good evening, everyone, and thank you so much for supporting the third annual Christmas Fair. [crowd cheering] I'm Chloe, this is Ted, and before the movie starts, we thought it would be a lot of fun to play movie trivia. We're gonna ask you questions, and if you know the answer, don't be shy, raise your hand, or just shout it out. Are you guys ready to play? [cheering] Yeah! [Ted]: All right, first question. In Frosty the Snowman, what was the name of the rabbit? Yeah. Hocus Pocus! That's correct. [whispers] Nice! Okay, question number two, in what city did Miracle on 34th St. take place? [calling] New York! New York, that's correct! Okay, in Dear Santa, what was the one wish Olivia had for her dad? A wife. That is correct! Everybody, whoa, that was a tough one! Not for me. Okay, thank you all so much! Enjoy the show! [applause] You okay? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's just, uh... I ate too much caramel corn, so... I just need to go walk it off. Yeah? Yeah. [♪♪♪] this is structurally sound? [laughing] Good night. Merry Christmas. [sighing] [sighs wearily] Hey. Hey. You filling in for Santa? [chuckles] No, just taking a break. That's too bad. I was hoping I could tell you my Christmas wish. [chuckles wryly] Hey, how are Kate and Sara? They're great. In fact, Kate is getting married. [gasps] I'm so happy for her, and for Sara. So, uh, are you and Ted planning on... No. Well, I don't know. Uh, not right now. But you may? Never say "never." Right. You know, um, I've been thinking, I don't know, this work travel just isn't worth it. You miss out on too much. I should go. Chloe... Yeah? I wish I had waited, that first year, so I could have come back and given us a chance. I'm mad at myself for not following my heart when I should have. Good night. Good night, Chloe. [♪♪♪] [door opens] [calling] Mom? Chloe? [chuckling in delight] Hi! Oh, I missed you. Oh, you look great! Oh, thank you, thank you. And... thank you for this. Thank you for decorating the house while I was gone. It's gorgeous. Of course! Oh, speaking of decorating, I got something for you. I ordered it before I left. I hope you like it. It's just something little. Ooh... Aw... You don't like it. I do! Mom, it's really sweet. Chloe, is everything okay with Ted? Yeah. Oh. Because I called you. No, that was fine. I was just, you know, having a moment. It was probably the moon or something. [clearing throat] Yeah. Or... Evan? Uh... Is he back? He is, actually. Yeah, his sister's getting married. [laughs] Isn't that great? Yeah, it is. Is he here with Raquel? No. They broke up, actually. I need to go pick up my dry cleaning, um, but you and Russ are coming tonight, right? Are you kidding? We wouldn't miss it. Great. I'll see you tonight. Ooh, and, uh, thank you. Aw, thank you, for this. - Okay. - Bye, sweetheart. Bye! [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Please stay up, please stay up, please stay up... Okay... - Hey... All right, stay, you dumb... Hey, here, here, come here. Let me do it. Ha! Good luck. [sighs] There. That should hold. [groaning] Oh... [blowing] Now I got fingerprints... Chloe, it looks fine. No, Chloe, Chloe... it looks fine. Hey, just relax, okay? Everything's going to be okay. [groaning in frustration] What? Chloe... I've been thinking about us. You, really, and... there's something I want to give you. Aw... [gasping] It's not what you think. A snowflake? It's your Christmas present. It's beautiful. Thank you. I wanted to give it to you now, 'cause... I won't be seeing you on Christmas, Chloe. Yes, you will. You're coming to my mom's dinner. Actually, I don't think I am. Why? Chloe, we both deserve to start the New Year off on the right foot, but... in order to do that, I don't think we should be stepping into it together. Oh. Okay, um... So you're breaking up with me. You and I both know we're not well suited for one another. Uh, Ted... I mean, we work great together, but what else do we have in common? I can't even go into your apartment because I'm allergic to your dog. I don't want you to have to give that up. I don't want you to have to give up anything. [sighs] Wow. Okay. You know, you're a really great guy, Ted. I hope you have a great Christmas, Chloe. You too. No, no, Janet, don't worry, he'll settle, and if he doesn't, just give him another bottle. No, he doesn't have colic. That's just how loud he burps. Okay, okay, bye. I'm going home before Randy's mom calls me again. [chuckles] Okay. I wish you could take me with you. Why, what happened? Ted just broke up with me. Aw, Chlo... I'm sorry. Are you okay? You know what? I'm actually really okay. Because you're not meant to be with Ted. You're meant to be with someone else, and we both know who that is. Thank you. Randy? Time to go. Come on, chop, chop, let's go. [♪♪♪] Hi. Chloe! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Would you like to have a glass with me? Oh, I can't stay. Um... Have you seen Evan? He had to go home. Like, your home, or...? Back to New York. He said he had a work emergency. He just left. Thank you. [♪♪♪] You look nice. [laughing] Evan! Evan, I... I'm so sorry, I, uh... I thought you were someone else. It's okay. Good night. [♪♪♪] [sniffles] [chuckles] Aw... Hey, Dasher. It's just not my Christmas. [sighing] [chuckles fondly] [♪♪♪] I can't believe this will be the last Christmas we spend in this house. I know. But you're the one that taught me, home is where family is, and you won't be far. I know. But you and I made so many memories here. And now it's time you and Russ started making some. Besides, I'm sure you'll have plenty to share seeing as how you're starting your own bakery together. True. Hey, you and I are both making some big changes this year. Yeah. Cheers to that. Yeah. Cheers to that. Yeah! I'll miss you. I'll miss you too. [message alert chimes] - 'Kay. Oh, Mom, I have to go put out a fire at the fair. Okay. Oh, this looks so good! Hey! Love you. - I love you too. Bye. - Bye! [♪♪♪] [blowing] Oh, wow, you weren't kidding. There are so many lights, I don't know where the short is coming from. Okay, Ted, you're a great organizer, but you're not an electrician. I'm texting Gary. Hey, hon, here we go. Strawberry burst with a protein punch. Oh, thanks, hon. I'm sorry, Chloe. I would have gotten you something. Oh, please, I've already had my chocolate caramel grande. That's a lot of sugar to start your day. Okay, done. Do you need anything else? I think I got this. Great. I'm headed to the office. Leave it to Gary! Yup, I'll leave it for Gary. Except I did it. Chloe? A minute? Sure. Everything okay? Everything is fine. In fact, the fair is going as smoothly as ever, thanks to you. And if there's anything I can say to convince you to stay, please tell me how. It's just time for me to have a change. I need to be on my own. I understand. So if you ever need any advice or any help, I'm always here. Thank you. This was a great idea, having some of the ornaments made by the kids. Ooh, I thought of another idea. What if each ornament had a special Christmas wish written on it by the maker? That's why this fair is always such a success. Which is why we have a surprise for you. What is it? Just follow me. Ice cream? [gasping] Gingerbread. Candy? Keep your eyes closed. [laughing] They're closed. Small little right here. Okay. Whoa... Now... open! [Chloe gasps] What do you think? [♪♪♪] Chloe, look! [gasps] That's beautiful. [whispering] Did you write your secret Christmas wish inside? I'm going to write it on the ribbon and then wrap it all around. Gosh, that sounds perfect. Is your mom here? No, she's at home baking, because Brent's family is coming for Christmas. Oh... Well, is anyone else... coming for Christmas? I was wishing Uncle Evan could come, but Mom said he may get a work promotion and move to Canada. Someplace where they speak French. That's not too far, is it? It's far enough. I better get going. I hope your wish comes true. [♪♪♪] Wait, so, you're moving? Yeah. I've been looking for a while. I already told my landlord. So you know where you want to go. Oh, I did find this cute place on Zillow. Check it out. So, it's 10 minutes from here, it's right near the city center, and I was thinking I could turn this extra room into my office. It's perfect. I don't know, I... I shouldn't over-think it. Hey, you're gonna be great at running your own business. I guess I just thought at this point in my life, I would have a partner. You know? Someone to go through the ups and downs with. You do. [chuckling] Come on. [chuckling] ♪ My gift for you is what you see ♪ ♪ My heart won't fit under the Christmas tree ♪ ♪ We'll sit and watch the children sing ♪ ♪ And feel all the gratitude Thank you. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Come on, Chloe, dance! Oh, I-I can't. I have to work. Thank you. Two! Oh, whoa! All right! Yeah. Calling it a night? Ho, ho, ho, hardly. But what about you? Shouldn't you be in there dancing? Eh, I'm not really in the dancing mood. Holiday blues? You could say that. Well, perhaps a Christmas wish would make your spirits a little lighter. Okay... I wish that... the man I've fallen in love with every Christmas for the past four years would come back. Wow, you're right. That is a tall order, even for me. [sighs] But lucky for you, the stars will guide you. Keep your eye to the sky. You never know what you might find. [chuckling merrily] Ho, ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho, ho! Good night, Mom. Good night, Russ. Night-night, sweetie. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Bye! Bye! [engine starts] [♪♪♪] [sighing] Okay... [chuckles] Let's go. Dasher! Dasher! Dasher! Dasher! Dasher! Dasher! Dasher! [♪♪♪] Uh... Look who I found. Evan, what...? Thank you. What are you doing here? I thought you were in Montreal. I was. But then a few days before Christmas, I talked to Sara, and I heard the disappointment in her voice... I couldn't do it. I came back. What about you? Did you have a good Christmas with Ted, or...? Oh, no, Ted and I aren't, uh... We deci... Well, he decided that we were better as friends, colleagues, really. Wait, so you're not engaged... or married? Engaged? What? Did you think that... Oh, my gosh, you thought that... No. No, I couldn't, I mean, I wouldn't. I... No, I didn't love Ted the way that I... I... I love you? Okay, listen, before you say anything else, I need to know, are you going anywhere else? Like to, I don't know, New Zealand, or the Arctic, or...? I'm staying right here, and I'm not letting another Christmas go by without you. [chuckling happily] I love you, Evan. I love you too, Chloe. Merry Christmas. [laughs] Merry Christmas. [sleigh bells ringing] [♪♪♪] [kissing] Oh! [Priest]: We are all gathered here on this magical Christmas Eve to witness the greatest union of all, the union of two hearts in matrimony. I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may seal it with a kiss. [applause] Whoo! [everyone cheering and clapping] We did it! Thank you! Thank you! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! [gasping] It's snowing! Wait, wait, let's get a picture. Let's get a picture. Okay. Everybody get in. [camera clicking] Okay, everybody say "Merry Christmas." Merry Christmas! [laughing] Merry Christmas, Mrs. Mathers. Merry Christmas, Mr. Mathers. [♪♪♪]
