[Glass breaks] [muffled chatter] Man: You're lying to me. Woman: What do you want me from me? - Man: Stop lying to me. - [Glass breaking] Woman: That's exactly where I went. Man: I checked the mileage on the car. Woman: [muffled chatter] Man: Don't talk to me like I'm stupid. [Muffled chatter] How many times do I have to tell you... I've seen the way you talk to him. - No! - You're making me look like a fool. [Indistinct chatter, crying] - Stop. No, please. - [Glass breaking] I don't believe you. [Crashing sound] I'm sorry. Please! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Help me! I see a remnants of it everyday. What do you mean? Last night I got a plate and there was dried blood on it. I guess I hadn't cleaned it well enough before putting it away. Everything seems so out of control. - That's interesting. - [Knocking on door] Are you leaving soon? Yeah, right after this session. I need to finish another session, but I will meet you there, okay? Okay. Um... Why was that interesting? Your comment about control. Domestic violence isn't really about violence. It is, but it's incidental to something much deeper, much darker. What is that? Control. Your husband wants to control you, Janet, and that's why he does what he does. That's why he's a threat to your daughter. - What do I do? - You'll do what all parents do when faced with protecting their children. You'll do what you must. Marnie, so good to see you. Yeah. Thanks, Logan. I am sorry for being late, but I am glad we are able to meet here and not in a courtroom. I truly hope we can find a solution to this situation. [Stammering] Thank you, Father Michaels. My client wants that, too. You are moving? Where? When? To California at the end of the summer. California? My client has a c-c-career opportunity. I, I'm sorry, but "opportunity"? What does that mean? When will Hitch see Scottie, then? [Stammering] Just as the proposed settlement indicates. During the summers and holidays? I am sorry, but this is bullshit. - Nice language. - It's not my language. I, I thought you wanted to resolve this today. What's to resolve? All of this today, that's what's bullshit. Restlessness, impulsiveness, drastic life changes. She could be having suicidal ideations - for all we know. - "Suicidal Ideations"? Go fuck yourself, Hitch. Go fuck myself? Thanks to you, that's about all I can do these days. Here's my answer to this. You can go fuck yourself. Oh my God. - Woman: Hey! - Man: What are you doing here? Woman: What am I doing here? - Man: This is my work. - You shouldn't be at work if you're not gonna answer my phone calls! - Don't come to my work, okay? - I'm gonna come to your work! - It's over! - [Indistinct arguing] Take this. I'm not joking. Woman: You get the fuck outta here! Man: You can't come to my fucking-- hey, stop it! - It's over! It's over! - I'm not leaving! Listen, I'm sick and tired of this shit! - [Slap] - Oh, shit. Man: I do not wanna see you anymore! Cut this shit out! Okay? I'm not fucking kidding! What? Ah-hem. Nothing to see here. Go away. Maybe I can help. I... I highly doubt it. What do you think of bugs? What? They're stupid, right? You turn on one of those bright light thingies, they just can't help themselves, they fly right into it. Every time. Pfzt! They don't learn. They're stupid. But we're just as dumb. Listen to me, go away! It's what you're doing, isn't it? Are you fucking deaf? He a doctor? Surgeon? Make a lot of money, something like that? Sounds like a pretty bright light, isn't it? Unless that's your first bruise. I watched my dad do the same thing to my mom for years, okay? I wanna help. Do I look like a victim? You certainly look hurt. Sorry, but not so sorry. I don't need your help. Come by tomorrow. 3 o'clock. Okay? [Instrument music playing] Hey. I thought it was mommy's night. It is. It is. I just had to see you. We get to hang tomorrow night. - Is that mommy practicing? - Yep. Do you like my friend Rufus? Yes. Any, uh, dinner requests for tomorrow? I want breakfast for dinner. Pancakes with uh... How much syrup are we talking here? - You know. - So, enough to cover the whole world, or just North America? The bigger one. How long does she practice? For forever. Can I talk to her, little man? You know, in college, I would have to wait all night to take your mom out, 'cause she'd never stop practicing. What're you doing? I won't stay long. I... I wanna make nice. Scottie, can you give your dad and me a second? Well, you sound amazing. I'm really glad you're playing again. You can't do this. You wanted to sell that thing. You remember? California? Why California? - I have an audition. - Bullshit. Hitch, nothing can change what happened to me. You're gonna have to learn to accept that. Did you brush your teeth? Yes. Can we play five questions? Hmm, I don't know, peanut. It's late. I'm pretty tired. Please? Okay. Question one. Um... what was the funnest thing you ever did with dad? Scottie... - I don't know. - Please? You have to answer my question. Well, I'm sorry, I'm not gonna answer that one. I don't wanna talk about your dad. Ask me another one. But those aren't the rules. You can ask me any other question. That's not fair. Okay, it's been a long day. I think it's time for you to go to sleep. Where'd you get this dog? Daddy gave it to me today. Time for bed. Hi, um, this is Marnie Hitchfield. And I think I need to make an appointment. I need your help on a few things with the building plans. The investors are coming tomorrow. Reschedule the meeting. I cannot reschedule again. You know this is very important. You don't even need me there. Marnie is being unreasonable, I understand. But it can not sabotage what we are trying to do. Logan, she's trying to take Scottie 2500 miles away from me. Turn and look at me. Hitch. Look at me. I know it is not fear you feel, my friend, but rage. I know that. But it's not right. I... I shouldn't feel this angry. I... I know what it can do to situations like this. You're being threatened. Rage is a natural response. The rage is normal. But what you do with it, that can become dangerous. I'm sorry. Leave the plans. I'll, uh, I'll look 'em over in the morning. I nailed it, did I not? I rung it. You rang it. I rung it. - You did rung it. - I know. Look at you, all grinnin' like you just got laid. Not that you'd know anything about that. You think I don't know romance? You forget I am married to the church. I thought that was nuns. Jesus likes both priests and nuns? Yes. The church goes both ways. Get the fuck out of here. Gerald? Voicemail: You have one new message. [Stammering] Hi, this is Bruno Daniels, Marnie's attorney. I'd like to discuss the, uh, custody arrangement we proposed. So... You know, that thing about therapists not starting the conversation? Yeah? Well, that ain't me. Tell me what happened. - With what? - With the fight the other day. What's the back story there? You know you've bugs in here. It's an old building. They don't want to be out in the cold, so they come in here. And you said bugs are dumb. Come again? The other day you said they were stupid. But they kill and eat their mates. - That sounds smart to me. - Yeah, but they have trouble getting a second date. I don't really wanna talk about this. Sorry, but not so sorry. That's a fairly annoying phrase you got there. You'll use it now. Just watch. I'll wield it mercilessly. So we just gonna ignore what happened? That sounds smart. Whatever. It doesn't matter now. He was doing what men do. Which is? Get what he wanted, and then leave me behind. - Like I'm dirt, or trash. - You know what, Grace, to be perfectly blunt, that sounds like a lot of drama. Aren't you a little too old for that? Too old? Thank you. It's a realization that always smarts. I'm not even sure why I'm here. - I doubt you can even help me. - I know I can. Yeah, your insults are already making me feel better. Now you know. I don't bullshit. What is it you want? Why don't you start by telling me his name. You gonna go talk to him? Nope. I just wanna know who he is. Hitch: The name is "Jeffries... Stewart." He works in the medical offices off of 9 Mile and Big Beaver. Scottie, don't forget the forks. Second name, Wendice. First name, Grace. Age 29. Female. Can you get those faxed over to me by, um, tomorrow at the very latest? Thank you. You're gonna sleep well tonight. What if I have a nightmare? Okay, we all have them. Even you? Yeah. But... then I remember that they're just dreams, and they don't scare me anymore. What's a nightmare you've had? - I don't know. - Please, daddy? Just tell me. I don't like it when I dream that I'm all alone. But then I wake up... and I remember that I have you, and all those nightmares just-- whew... drift away. [Telephone ringing] Hello, Mr. Hitchfield. The custody arrangement? Hitch, it's me. Marnie. - Hitch? - Um, what do you want? I need to talk to you. Actually, I want to talk to you, too. Would you, would you please just listen? What? I want to take Scottie with me for my audition. The one in California. For how long? A week. Who all's going? It's just us. You're lying, aren't you? - Hitch, please. - I know what you're doing. You're taking him out there, gonna see how it goes, see if he'll be okay out there. - Isn't that a good thing? - Marnie, No. I'm not okay with this. Are you out of your fucking mind? Seriously, you're going to yell in a domestic violence clinic? What is wrong with you? Hey Alfredo. Dirty Blonde, please? Just get off work? Yeah. Brutal, man. Total ass-fuck. Cheers? To what? To brutal ass-fucks, obviously. They're certainly worth cheering. Stewart. Gerald. Wow. What a mess. You outta see my personal life. All right. Here's to sucking equally. [Cell phone ringing] Hey, you mind if I get this? Go right ahead. Hello. Hey. Okay. Is everything Okay? Sure. Yeah, Okay. Yeah, I'll stop by tomorrow. Okay, good. All right. Sounds good. Bye. So... what do you do for work, Gerald? It's boring. Come on man, don't be like that. What do you do? I'm a therapist. - A head shrinker. - Yeah. I shrink heads. You ever do abuse cases? Sure. Fucking kids today are such pussies, man. You wanna know what abuse really looks like? How can I say no? So when I was like... ten or something, I got this really sharp pain in my gut. And um... the only problem is, is the old man doesn't have insurance. So about about a week or so later, the pain gets so intense... I pass out in school. My appendix had ruptured. I mean, it'd gone septic, man, I almost died. I should've died. So my old man makes his way to the hospital, and the very first thing he says to me-- and I kid you not... is, "how could you do this to me, man?" To me. That's difficult. That bastard was fuckin' brutal, man. Seriously? Look at this fuckin' asshole. Hard to miss him. Okay. Stewart. [Hissing] [laughing] - Whoops. - Why would you do that? I mean, look at this guy. He's like two inches. You can't, you can't just do that! Was it a bit much? A bit? What the hell's the matter with you? I don't know, man, you're the headshrinker. You figure it out. All right, just 'cause you're angry, doesn't mean you can go around destroying everything you see. - Says who? - Says who? [Laughing] Karma's got an opinion on that subject. Karma? Karma, seriously? Listen, I save people's lives. There's plenty left on the credit side of that ledger, I can assure you. [Laughs] It's a terrible way to live. Oh, I know. It's horrible. I don't know how I live with myself. I mean, look at this piece of shit I gotta drive every day. - [Engine starts] - [laughs] I have two more just like it. And you should see my house. You should see my girlfriend. Mmm-Mmm. What about her? She's amazing. She's beautiful. Smart. Sexy as all hell. Ugh. And she plays the cello, man. The cello! Who plays the fucking cello? - [Laughs] - Not many people. No. And you wanna know how we met? I saved her life, man. [Indistinct chatter] I don't give a shit. That's my Karma, bro. Hey. You can kill yourself if you try to drive right now. Hey, get this. Being drunk increases your chances of survival. It's a statistical fact. Your body like stays looser, you know? The drivers, they always survive. But you might wind up hurting somebody else. Yeah. Okay, fine. You're probably right. I wanna show you something. He's done this before. Being stupid about men is one of my endearing qualities, Hitch. I don't like it when you're so hard on yourself, Grace. But I'm good at it. Do you find yourself drawn to... assertiveness... strength? Yes. Assertive men aren't all bad, Grace. Just violently assertive men. Why did you stay, after it became violent? - I don't know. - That's a cop-out. He gave me a way out. Out of...? Gary, Indiana. And you haven't lived there in how long? Over eight years. Amazing how that follows us around, isn't it? Yeah... amazing. I wonder what you would think of him if you met him. - But I did. - You what? - When? When did you see him? - Last night. But you said that you wouldn't! I wanted to see what I could see. Which was...? He's handsome. A doctor. He drives a nice car. I see the appeal. But I saw an abuser, too. You did? You really did? I see what you see. I see what you see. Thank you. I want you to tell him... that you see him for what he truly is. - There's no way... - Confront him. Take back the power that he took from you. Besides, you just might save someone else. I don't think I can do that. He's seeing someone new. Who? Who is he seeing? - Sorry I'm late, babe. - Oh, it's all right. I got caught up on the news. What's going on in the world? Uh, calamity. Catastrophe. Death. Nothing interesting. So, you said you wanted to talk about something? Is, is everything okay? I set it. I set my audition. Right. That, that's great. You okay? Yeah, yeah, I just... When you said you wanted to talk, I, I got nervous. Why? I don't know. I just kept thinking that you were gonna wake up one of these days and realize that you don't wanna do this anymore. - Why would you think that? - I don't know. I just get nervous. That's all. [Cell phone ringing] Who is that? Oh, it's nothing. So, Scottie's not home, is he? - Mmm. - Hmm? - No. - No? Look at that. That has healed nicely. - Yeah. - Yeah. You know, I got a great idea. What's that? When we get back from California, why don't we go spend a week up at my cabin. Just the two of us. Nice and romantical. - That could work. - Yeah? Mm-hmm. We could sleep in all day, go for long walks on the beach. Have you ever been to the dunes before? - No. - No? Oh God, it's like a... it's like an alien land. You're gonna love it. So, what do you say, huh? You down? - Oh, I'm down. - Oh really? Hey, where were you when I called you last night? It sounded like a bar. It was. It as ridiculous. Really? Mm-hmm. What were you doing? I was playing darts, of all things, with a domestic violence counselor. If you can imagine me hanging out with somebody like that. [Knocking on door] Excuse me. May I help you? I came here to warn you. What? Don't trust him. Excuse me? He's an asshole who likes to hit women. So, don't trust him. What are you talking about? Tell her, Stewart. Who is this? Look, I'm really sorry about this. You know her? Yes. - We knew each other. - Knew each other? We dated for two years, you asshole. Grace, we broke up over a year ago. Okay, I don't know what's going on here, - but could you- - He hit me. He, he choked me. He called me a bitch. A whore. And I'm not the first. He's done this before. What is this? Look, Marnie... Is it true? Yes. I mean, yes and no. I was arrested, but it was a long time ago, and the charges were dropped. And I swear I never did anything - to hurt her, ever. - You're a liar. She's insane. Okay? She's stalks me, broke into my house, claimed she was pregnant. Follows me to my work. I mean, how did she even know I was here? How did you find him? Who gave this to you? Uh, my therapist. Is his name Hitch? Hitch, Gerald? Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, what? [Pounding on door] [pounding continues] Someone's at the door. Go back to bed, Scottie. - Ugh! - Please. Please... tell me, this is some mistake. Please? Have you lost your mind? You pull this shit, right after we get funding? - What have you done? - It's not that simple. It is not? Is he dating Marnie? How could you be so selfish? This could cost us everything! Cost? Marnie is trying to take away my son. And she's paying for it by a man who beats up women! Now do you get that? You get the irony there? These women come to us for help! And you betrayed that. Do not come back to the clinic tomorrow. Did you do something bad? No. No, I didn't. I knew he looked familiar. He was there that night you came to the E.R., wasn't he? I don't know. I imagine he was. So he was stalking me. That's how he found out about Grace. Man, you got a crazy, crazy ex. Look. I was arrested. I was young, and I... I made a stupid mistake. Okay? I just can't have stuff like that around Scottie. I mean, what would've happened if she came over while he was here? I know. Look. I am so sick of this place. Just get me out of here. Father Michaels: There is no excuse for what he did. None whatsoever. Let me record that on my phone. I bet my attorney will like that. May I show you something, please? Grace, I want you to know what we are trying to do here. Helping sad women, father? No. Helping women reclaim their strength, Grace. Just what do you want from me? I'm asking for your forgiveness. If you sue, you will shut this place down. That's not fair. You should not have hired wackos. I did not set this place up. Hitch did. He hired me. I cannot count how many times he has helped. I thought you were in charge. I am, now. What happened? His wife, Marnie, got sick, and he left to take care of her. She got better. And once she was better, she left him. You don't have to worry, Logan. - She can't sue the clinic. - I can't? - You just watch me. - Hitch, you cannot be here. She has no leverage. Ms. Wendice here has a felony record. - That's in the past. - Yeah, but the warrant out of Indiana for felony identity theft and credit card fraud, that's still in the present. I wouldn't put the clinic at risk, Logan. - You should know that. - So, what? You think I'm a liar? - He really did those things. - I know. I know he did. But I meant for us both to get what we wanted. Bullshit! You're an asshole just like everyone else! [Moaning] [stammering] S-s-sign this. - Or else? - Get censured by the State Board, l-l-lose your license. L-lose in court, lose your s-s-s-s... Son, right? You committed at least five serious violations of your p-p-professional ethics, Mr. Hitchfield. Sign this, now. Signing this means losing my son. Sorry... but not so sorry. You know, if, if you just would've gone to court, you never would have lost. I told Marnie this. That stutter. It must've been quite an impediment to overcome being a lawyer, I'd imagine. Yes it-it was. But that's all anybody ever notices about you, isn't it? Not your suit. Not your tie. Just that abominable, insufferable s-s-st... stutter. Now, try saying that five times fast, B-Bruno. If he ever lays a finger on my wife or my son... You'll do w-what, Mr. Hitchfield? P-p-press charges, counsellor. [Scraping noise] [knocking on door] So you finally decide to come. Thanks for the fucking scarf. Sign this. No. Goddamn it, Hitch. Sign it, let me go. No fucking way. Even though I can destroy you? Even though I absolutely will. Why are you sleeping out here? Why do you have that door locked from the outside? It's for storage. You're lying. Marn... Come on, babe. Marnie? Hey! Don't you fucking... Come on! Gerald Hitchfield! What would your mother say? Hitch, what is this? Did you move this all in here from the old house? Oh... Do you think that feelings echo... like sound? I come in here hoping that they do. Two of six. - Maybe seven. - Maybe seven. That could have been us. The crazy family. All those little-- - Stop it. - I know we can't have that but can't we just... Just, just say something. Just say something. Don't I deserve that? You've never even given me that. Stop thinking that there's a reason, a justification. How can I not? How can you not? Because it nearly made me go insane, okay? But I did nothing wrong. I didn't give you that cancer. I didn't... I didn't take away our daughter. We didn't even know what it was-- Oh, we knew. We knew. And we loved her. Hitch, what do you want? I want it all... I want it all to make sense. Like going in for an ultrasound and finding out I'm gonna die? That kind of sense? In what world do you live? Sign it. Sign. Sign it, please. Sign the document, Hitch. Please. I don't want to hurt you... but if I have to, I'll make it so that you don't even see Scottie every other fucking Christmas. No, please? Please? I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Gerald? What do you want? An apology? What you did you to me was really fucked up. Well... you were less important to me than my family. Keep selling that heroism shit to yourself. We both know you are a bought and paid for asshole. Let me show you something. Maybe I'll seem a little more human to you. Hmm. He's handsome. Such a cutie. I can't lose him, Grace. You understand that? Yeah. What're you gonna do? Just get rid of him. [Sighs] You'd already thought of that. Hey, parents keep their kids safe. That's what they do. It ain't a sin. I don't believe in sin. I want us both to get what we want. That is what you said. I believe you. I can help. This is only for Scottie. To keep him safe. That's it. What other reason would there be? Do you, um, want Scottie for the whole week when we get back? Why, you got plans? Okay, I'm out of here. I'll be back to pick up Scottie so you have plenty of time for your audition, - okay? - Okay. Fuck, Marn, can't you... can't you just feel it? I mean, look at this. You know? It's... We're not moving yet. I know, I know. I'm just... getting excited about the possibilities. That's all. You know? I mean, I already feel cleaner. [Cell phone ringing] I know. I'm out of town at the moment. Soon. It's bad, isn't it? Mom? Mom? - Please. - Mom? I'm coming My audition is coming up. I know. When I'm gone are you gonna be okay? Yes. Hey. Hey. You know you're my universe, right? What do you think? You like it here? I like the swings at home better. Me, too, babe. Me, too. This isn't about him. This is about Scottie. Okay, it's about Scottie. Are you just gonna leave him with Stewart? Can you take that risk? Don't bargain with me using my son as currency. There are other risks. A risk in doing something, a risk in doing nothing. Both big risks. And you think killing him is the right risk? I wasn't talking about him. What? - Fuck no. - What's to keep the next asshole she meets from being a threat to Scottie? This is an aberration. Because your experience tells you that a woman who dates an abuser never does it again? If I remove him, she'll come back. Okay? She'll have no choice. I'm a woman, Hitch. Trust me. And if the other choice is thermonuclear war, we always have a choice. That's not her. Okay? I know her. Oh yeah? Why did she still choose Stewart? I don't believe in violence against women. Are you sure about that, Mr. Hitchfield? [Cell phone ringing] Ugh! Fuck you! Fuck! Parents keep their children safe. It's what we do. It's not a sin. [Buzzing] Marnie: Where are you? Right where you left me. I need to talk to you. About..? I've been thinking about what I saw. - About that room. - It's no longer an issue. I'm worried about Scottie, about him staying with you. It's my job to take care of him. Typically, it's the father's responsibility to care for his family. We're not a family anymore. No, we're not. You, uh... you wanna tell me about your audition? No. Okay. I'm... I'm having second thoughts about moving out here. - So what do you think? - It's perfect. Untraceable. If you can do it. Don't worry. I can do it. May I have that thing? You mean my taser? It's strong enough to take down a very large man. Hitch: I'm not gonna need it for one. - What do you want? - Enjoy the week, asshole. 'Cause when it's done, I'm taking Marnie and Scottie with me to California. Enjoy the week She'll leave you just like she left me. We'll see about that. This thing we're doing... we're doing it together. It'll bind us together forever. Marnie: Are those the dunes? Stewart: Yep. I need to go into town tomorrow. Is that okay? Yeah, yeah, sure. Why not. - [Knocking on door] - Uh, Logan? You got time for an old friend? Please, come in. My cancer has come back. Marnie, I am so so sorry. I needed to talk to you about Scottie. I need to make sure that he's okay after I'm gone. Won't Hitch take care of him? No. He can't. Why not? Because there is something wrong with Hitch. That tastes funny. Have some more. Can we play five questions, dad? Sure. Um... what was the funnest thing you ever did with mom? Um... when we were first dating, your mom and I took this epic hiking trip, to an island called Isle Royal. And we saw wolves and bears and moose, if you can believe that. Sounds incredible, doesn't it? Yeah. She was... so... alive. I wish you could've known her. I do know her. Not like she was. Is that why you don't like her anymore? Time to go to sleep, buddy. But I got four more. It's already logged in. Just go online, buy some stuff, but not too much. Get what I'd get, okay? Not what you'd get. I need your cell. - Why? - I'm taking it with me. Why would you do that? Well, I'm sure not using my phone. I don't want you using mine. Well, we need my phone here, don't we? And I don't have another phone. If something goes wrong out there, you're gonna want me to call you. You should've gotten a burner. Keep it turned off. I will. Can I trust you? I'm asking the same thing about you. [Door opens, closes] [to self] Welcome home, dear. Hello? Uh... hey. How's it going? I didn't realize you were gonna be gone all day. I'm sorry I'm late. Sorry. Yes, you certainly sound like you are sorry. Listen, Stewart. I don't... When are we gonna talk about your audition. Okay? We still haven't talked about it. You haven't told me how it went. I didn't audition. There wasn't one. What the hell are you talking about? Stewart, wake up. California is gone. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Were you ever, ever serious about California, at all? Ever? I fucking knew it. Hitch was right. You fucking cunt. Don't talk to me like that. Oh, It is a harsh word, I agree. But if the shoe fits... You know what? Guys don't play this way. We don't fuck with people's emotions. If we've got our doubts about something we just say it. We don't play fucking games. My life, and my future, isn't a game to me, Stewart. I am trying to-- - Shut Up! - Ahh! What the fuck? I'm sorry, you cunting with your cunting little cunt? I'm sorry, I cunt hear you. Could you please cunt again? Oh, I'm sorry, Marn. Does my language offend you, Marn? Huh? Fuck you. Say it again. Say it again. Yeah, I dare you. Come on. Fuck it. Fuck you. Fuck You. Fuck You. Say it again! Say it again. [Pounding on door] Now that I did't expect. Who is it? Oh, fuck you. [Cocks gun] Please. Please. Make this easy on me. Hitch, are you here? Scottie. Oh my God. Why would you leave the taser here? Please. You must look after Scottie, something is not right. They always leave me. Always. But I had figured out how to stop that. Oh, Hitch, you have to stay with me. You have to. Ms. Wendice, I do not understand, but I am telling you, you must go look at Scottie. - Something is wrong-- - He's fine. Hitch just drugged him with some sleep medicine. Please, Ms. Wendice! Something is not right with that boy. Here. Hands and feet. Put it on him. Arms behind. Tight, tight. Tight! Now step away. Is Scottie Okay? Now do you see what a threat this man is to my son? You're no better than me, buddy. Yes I am. I'm a father. I knew you were too much of a pussy to use that. - It's time to, uh... - Hey, hey. Keep quiet, Stewart. Okay... okay, okay, okay, okay, okay! - Marn? Marn! - Stewart. Shh! Now... - let's see... - No, no, no! If you really are a heartless bastard. What the fuck is wrong with him? He like pale as shit! Why didn't you take the taser with you? I'm a witness. I'm a witness. Of course, I'm a witness. And my phone and my car. - Fuck! - What is it? He's going to frame me, he's gonna use my own taser on me, and then he's gonna make it look like I cut and run. Hitch wants to fuck me over? I can fuck him over. What is Hitch doing? He's gonna kill Stewart. And then Marnie. And then me. But he's not the only one capable of murder. What? No, Grace! He's just a boy! Please, Grace. I can help. Please, Grace. No! Please, don't do this! Please, Grace. No! You just killed him. Well, that was the point. He's threatened to take away my son. Marnie! Stop! Marnie! Marnie! We need to discuss the custody arrangements, Marnie! Marnie! Stop! Marnie! Enough. I have had enough. Where the fuck are you? [Echoing] Ugh! Gerald? [Police radio chatter] [indistinct chatter]
