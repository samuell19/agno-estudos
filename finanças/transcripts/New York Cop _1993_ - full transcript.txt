You got money for pussy, then you've got money for me! You've got to be fucking kidding me. Yeah, I'm kidding. [grunts] [metal clinking] [groans] [groans] [groans] [groaning] [groaning] I'll make sure you ain't never gonna fuck no pussy no more. [moaning] [groans] [choking] [gun cocks] Hold it right there! [tense music playing] [crash] [gun shot] [music playing] [music playing] Holy shit. [gunfire] Get down. Shit. [groaning] You motherfucking bastard. You shot me. Don't move or you're dead. Stinking chink. How'd you get to be a cop? [sirens] I'm Japanese. How do you get to be a human being? POLICEMAN: We need you to go undercover. You're Japanese. No one will ever suspect that we've got an undercover Japanese cop. I don't like it. Listen. I know you paid your dues up at the academy. Now, you've come a long way since you drifted in here from San Francisco. We suspect organized crime is the main supplier. We want you to find out if we're right. Take a look at these. As you can tell, it was done by a professional hit man. All right. Here's the game plan. You'll meet your contact at Avenue D, 10th street. You'll see the letter Z on the side of a building. The code color for tomorrow is blue. Don't forget that. You want to contact me, you call me on the private line. Only Marge is authorized to answer that. You got it? Hey. You look troubled, man. You want to go to a sushi bar? Later, Danny Boy. It's a real disaster, isn't it? Yeah. I've been assigned to this unit. Aah. Welcome aboard, man. [music playing] Who's that? Look, man, the less we know, the safer we're going to be. Right. Don't ask so much question, man. Go home and get some rest, eh. I have to get my bag. All right. I'll be upstairs. [dog barking] Spare a cigarette? Please? The sky was so blue when I fell asleep. Blue is a beauty color. Come on. Let's get inside before you got cold. [distressed sounds] What the fuck are you doing? You don't look like a fucking cop to me, man. My left-hand pocket. Oh, God. They send me a fucking rookie. What are you fucking crazy? I don't believe this. You fucking smell, to boot. I smell? Yeah. You smell of soap. You're not going to the goddamn ballet. Look, if you're going to be here, you're going to become one of the people who lives here. OK. You've got to conduct yourself like them. You've got to dress like them. You've got to beg like them. Give me the parka. Come on. Give me the fucking coat. What the hell are you doing? You look like you're about to enter a 5th Avenue restaurant with this damn parka. This has been a six month fucking stakeout meet, and you very nearly could have blown the entire fucking thing by walking in here in your designer clothes. My name is Toshi. Hey. Hey. I don't give a fuck if your name is Mitsubishi. Get down there. Get real. Get with the fucking program before you get us both rammed up the ass. All right. Why did they send you down here? - They need more guys. - Yeah. No. You better get your rap straight, or the brothers will be cutting you a new asshole. How do I contact you? I'll find you. Show your face. I'll ask for a cigarette. Stick your message inside the cigarette pack. I'll take care of it from there. One more thing, you know who your worst enemy is? You mean the gangs? No. Feds, narcos, because guys like you get killed by friendly fire. Something else to worry about. Well, carry your piece. Or if you feel like that's going to blow your cover, I don't know, carry something on you can conceal to protect yourself. I know my charts. [laughs] fucking great. Great. So I'm going to play the fucking Green Hornet to your Bruce fucking Lee. Well, man, good fucking luck. [music playing] [men chattering] It's gonna come down tonight. Yeah. 'Cause the shelters are all full. [coughing] I'm cold. We gotta go. Yeah, I know. I heard they're closing them up, you know? Hey. What you looking at, asshole? I'm looking for a place to sleep. You got some money? You can stay here. Is that all? [speaking spanish] Fucking shithead. Look at his his eyes, man. You, you have the eyes of a hunter. Understand? No? [speaking spanish] You have the eyes [laughs] of a hunter. [music playing] [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish] [shouting] [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish] What are you gonna do? You gonna fucking kick me out? Get him! Go, get him! Get that punk! Who the fuck are you? Please, get me out of here. They will kill me. Holy shit. [shouting] [music playing] We're OK now. Thanks. You saved my life. You collect junk for a living? You could say that. [metal clanks] Are you all right? Let me help you with that. Thanks. What's your name, anyway? Toshi. Toshi, you come with me. You're pretty strong for a homeless person. You are a splendid artist. Thanks. Are you famous? If you buy one of my works, you'll be the first own a Maria Mendoza original. Who knows, you might send me off to stardom. I can tell you're not a junkie. You don't seem like someone who needs a daily injection. I don't do drugs. Yeah? What do you do? You don't impress me as the homeless type. I had some bad luck. Can I have a glass of water? Oh, sure. I'm sorry. Thanks. You know it's raining pretty hard outside. [music playing] Do you have a place to sleep? I'll find a place. You helped me carry some of this junk up. If you want, you can crash here. You know, those guys are still after you. You don't even know me. Are you sure? It's OK. I sleep with a shotgun nearby. Thanks. Don't mention it. It's the least I can do for a connoisseur of art. Good night. Good night. [knocking] [footsteps] Hey. Hey. How are you? How come you left your shit out in the truck? You waiting for me to bring it up? No it was coming down like crazy last night after I got upstairs. Who the fuck is this? He's a friend. He needed a place to stay. What, you let him spend the night here last night? - Yeah. - What are you, Mother Theresa? Hey listen, pal, you better be one of those art school fags, or I'm going to cut your heart out. Hey, he's better than one of your brotherhood bums. Hey, that's none of your business. Listen, this ain't no Chinese Hong Kong Hilton. [music playing] So why don't you get your ass out of here. Hey, you wait a minute here. No, you wait a minute. I don't want this bastard up here. Take a hike. [speaking spanish] This is my house. I'm sorry, Toshi. My brother is a loco. You know, he's crazy. Well, listen, you know, you can come back here another time. I'm sorry, OK? I'm really sorry. What the hell are you doing? This is my house. What are you doing telling my guests where to go? HAWK: Since when are you picking fucking bums off the street? MARIA: Mr. Criminal! Don't you tell me what to do! HAWK: Ah. You still here? I just want you to know, I only crashed over there. Good. Now get the fuck out of my face. Maybe you could use me. Why could I use somebody like you? Fuck off and stay the hell away from my sister. I'm not interested in your sister. I'm good with my hands. I know martial arts. All right, tough guy. Come with me. [music playing] WOMAN: You know what else Dominicans like? [laughter] TITO: What else do Dominicans like? Hey. What the fuck are they doing here? WOMAN 1: We were lonely. WOMAN 2: Yeah. We got nothing to do. Take a hike, sweetie. We've got business. She's my girl, man. They stay. Get rid of them. But-- What are you do with fuck-face here? We chased his ass last night. He says he wants to join the hood. Yeah? Skinny, dumb bastard. Well, Tito, he says he's pretty good with his hands. What do you say we give him a little test, uh? Yeah. OK. OK, big man. Let's see how good you are, huh? Huh? [speaking spanish] [music playing] All right. You see these guys over here, Toshi? They owe us a lot of money. It's time to go prove yourself. Yeah. Go get them, killa. He's got major medical, these motherfuckers. [laughs] [chattering] Mm-hm. Which number were you? I don't know. [laughter] This ain't the fucking laundry mat. What do you want? I have a money proposition to discuss with your boss. Oh yeah? Who are you? I'm from Kawasaki. [laughter] This gentleman wants to see the boss. He says he's from Kawasaki. Let me take a look at you. I want to identify the remains. Go ahead. He's upstairs. Go ahead. Later, tough guy. Where do you want the body sent? [woman moaning] GANGSTER: Yeah. Mm. Fuck yeah. [moaning continues] Oh, yeah. Who the fuck are you? I know you are busy, but I'm here to collect a debt. Well, get the fuck out of here. [glass breaks] MEN: Whoa. Check this out. [laughter] I'm going to kick your fucking ass. MEN: Whoa. Incoming. Fuck. [laughs] Damn. I think grizzly is next. Let's get going, man. By now, that fucking asshole's either dead, or he got his ass kicked. No! I like this guy. Give the little fuck the money. Give him anything he wants. - Let him go! You understand? Come on, buster. Let him go. You'll get your money. Give him anything he wants. I don't know, Tito. I'm liking this guy. [chattering] Keep your head in. Come on. Come on. Roll up. Give me a hand. [music playing] Stack them up with the rest. How's it going, Tito? My name's Hawk. What the hell is your name, anyways? I'm Toshio Murakami. Call me Toshi. All right, Toshi. You're looking at a deal that's going real sweet right now. Sometimes they turn into cluster fucks. Which is better, buying or selling? It depends. Are you dealing with drugs too? We deal with everybody. It's a new common market. See the Italians, they make the big fucking money. And we do all the dirty work. That doesn't sound fair. It's not. And on top of that, when you're dealing with the main man, you've got gotta watch your back. Why deal with him? Well, because he's the man. He controls the gun market. Who is the top man? You ask a lot of questions, Toshi. I'm not trying to pry into your business. It's just that if you need guns, I can get them. Where the fuck are you going to get guns? Are you dealing with somebody I don't know about? You need them, I will get them. Trust me. Well, I sure could use somebody I can trust, somebody that's going to stand by my side. How about giving me a shot? Maybe, Toshi. Maybe. Man, I don't trust the fucking jap, man. Just keep your eye on him, 24/7, man, 24/7. You here me? - Got that. All right. [music playing] Oh! You stupid, homeless fuck. You bumped into me. I know you. No shit. Don't turn around. Across the street, you're being tailed. I can't find power. Is it urgent? Give me a message. I need a gun. I'll arrange it. Danny Boy will talk to you. Meet Danny Boy at Washington Square Park. [phone ringing] MARGE (ON PHONE): Hello. This is Marge Cerilo. KONEN LI: This is Konen Li. MARGE (ON PHONE): What's today's color? KONEN LI: It's blue. Let me talk to Brodsky. BRODSKY: Brodsky here. KONEN LI: It's Konen Li. Damn it, the rookie could have blown my cover. BRODSKY: It was an accidental meeting. It won't happen again. It better not. I'm close to finding out who's supplying the hardware. There's a big meet tomorrow night. BRODSKY: In Chinatown, the feds have been notified. Rising sun needs a gun. BRODSKY: We'll take care of it. [bell ringing] [music playing] DANNY BOY: [humming] Ba da da, da da, da da da da da. Ba da da ba ba ba ba ba. ba ba ba. Ba ba, eh. What you think? The lady's fine. She needs a present. It's that time. What's up. All right. All right. Eh, my brother. All right.

Got it. Got it. Mm-mm-mm. It's showtime. You ready? - OK. [music playing] You see that? He's a cheap fucking thief. I don't fucking believe this guy. PA: Railroad passenger, Ken Anderson. Please report to ticket window number three. Long Island Railroad passenger, Mr. Ken Anderson, please report to ticket window number three. MAN: Mikey, I left my lock. Come on. Let's go. [music playing] That's them over there. It's time. You've got to nail them during the exchange. You got it. Sit down. Now. How come Asian people don't trust us? That's the only way we can survive is to see. And we are not going to change our ways. The deal is $25,000 for all the guns. The deal's off. Relax, gentlemen. Take it easy. We'll work it out. [non-english speech] We are not saying we won't pay. You get half the money now. And the balance, you get just before the next shipment. OK? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. [non-english speech] [gunfire] [non-english speech] [non-english speech] That way. [non-english speech] FBI. Freeze. Fuck. I'm a cop. Drop it. You're bleeding. You OK? - Get away from me, kid. You'll get hurt! I said, get away from me. [gunfire] Ferrara, where the hell were ya? No! Wake up. Wake up. Good man, Toshi. Good. All the serial numbers filed out? Looks good. We can be a team. Maybe. Listen, let me ask you something. You got a little action going on the side for yourself? I mean, I heard about the Tongs down in Chinatown. But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Me? No. No. I didn't think so. I mean, a briefcase full of guns could show up anywhere, right? Be with you in just a second. Be right with you. Oh, hi. Be back in a second, I swear. What's up, Maria? Be careful, honey. You're gonna scare all the customers away. Come on, Toshi. Give me another beer. Me too. So I hear you've been spending a lot of time with my brother. What's wrong with that? Why do you want to get involved with the hood? I'm an illegal alien. In the brotherhood, no one can touch me. We're all set for tomorrow. How well do you know Brooklyn? What's going down? Just meet me in my crib at 9:00 AM. What's up. What's up. I'll be right back. Forget about it. Hey, brother. Spare a cigarette? Beautiful. You got a light? Konen Li is dead. [music playing] Damn. That's two now. How did it happen? Feds shot him. The Feds? Eh, they wounded him, another case of friendly fire. Then that sick bastard, whoever he is, finished him off. God help us if he knows who we are. Be careful, man. Be sure to cover your ass. [music playing] Yeah. I got it. I got it. Good work, Powell. Listen, I'll arrange a back up with Brooklyn North Task Force. OK? Yes sir. Marge, get me Brooklyn North Task Force. Yes, Captain. I got him, Captain. Charlie, Brodsky here. Listen. I need a big favor. A lot's happening in your territory tonight. I need back up. [music playing] Yeah. That Sammy T, he better be on the up and up. Yeah, I hate dealing with the blacks. Just can't trust the motherfuckers. Oh, man. What makes you think you can trust gooks, huh? Hey, fuck you, asshole. No, no, fuck you. Fuck you. Mario, stay here. Sledge, keep your eyes peeled. [music playing] What's up, bro? Let's get to business. Tito. What the fuck we got to meet in this place for, man? Because I don't want to be you in no back alley, bro. So let me see the product, man. [laughs] Let me see the. Money Tito, go with him. OK. Come on. [speaking spanish] POLICE RADIO: Delta Team, are you in position? Delta team, standing by. All right. It's done. You motherfuckers are so easy. Give me your piece. Now! Easy. Easy. Ice man, get the others. All right. WOMAN: Ah! [gunshot] Try to back stab me. [grunting] [inaudible], huh? Try to back stab me? Yeah, backstab this. Tito. Tito, la policia. La policia. Policia. [speaking spanish] [screaming] [gunshots] [gunfire] [yelling] [sirens] Get out! Get out! Put 'em up! Put 'em up! Put your fucking hands up. Get 'em up. Put 'em up. Put 'em up. Get off me. Get off me, man. Men, put your hands above your head. [music playing] You're a dead man. Oh, man. Oh, man.

Shut the fuck up. Mario, grab the guns. We'll meet back at the compound. And don't get lost or nothing, you dumb chink. I ain't through with you yet, man. Shut the fuck up. [speaking spanish] WOMAN (ON PHONE): Hello. Can I help you, please? Hello? Hello? Hello? [music playing] You're just jealous because he's got bigger balls and he's smarter. You're telling me, man? It's not strange to find an army of cops waiting for us when only we know the location beforehand? Huh? Maybe they followed the other guys. If he's a cop, why the fuck would they shoot at him? Then what the fuck is he? How come he ain't back here, Tito? You're too fucking paranoid. If he's a snitch, prove it. If not, shut the fuck up. OK. OK. Fine. Fine. Fuck it. Let's go. [speaking spanish] [car revs] [tires screech] [music playing] [sirens] Three dead cops in a week, man. I could have been number four. Don't even think about it, man. There's always that possibility, huh. Hey. I closed, all right, man. But come back tomorrow, all right? All right? Good. Easy now. Jeez. Powell was a good cop. Yeah, well he pissed a lot of people off with that mouth of his, huh. He was a great guy though. [brakes squealing] [music playing] Toshi, come on in. You look lost. I've been here three years. Everyone has a falling out in this town, especially me. You're not cut out for New York. Please, get out of the brotherhood. The brotherhood is not the problem. Then what is? Look. I'm sorry I was so cold to you. I thought it over, and I realized you really didn't have a choice if you're here illegally. Does that make you feel better? I-- I don't know what I want to say. That's why the Americans can't understand the Japanese, because you don't say what's on your mind. Did you eat? Not yet. How about Japanese food? OK. [phone ringing] Oh. Let me get that, OK? Hello? Yes, this is Maria Mendoza. Yes? Really? Oh, yes. OK. Well, thank you very much. OK. Yes, you too. Have a good night. [speaking spanish] Oy. It's happening. Is really happening. That was the art gallery. They like my work. They are going to show my work. [laughs] That's great! Oh, now I've got to buy you dinner, OK? Oh, oh my god. I have been waiting for this all of my life. All of my life. This is great. And now it's like I've got a chance! Thanks for dinner. You really brought me good luck. No, it's you. You know, luck is important. All my life, I never had any. My whole family, just look at Geraldo. I worry about him all the time. But ever since I met you, my luck has finally started to change. The whole world seems full of possibility, full of life. I still can't believe it. Maria. [music playing] (SINGING) I don't know some man's rainbow. I don't know many wishing well. I don't know how long as always. I don't know what time will tell. I don't know what I forgot. And I don't know what's yet to come. But I know when I'm in love. And I don't know your mathematics. Never read your history book. I don't know just how it got here. I don't know how long it took. Well, I don't know a rhyme and a reason for all these things I'm thinking of. But I know when I'm in love. I don't know some men's heartbreak. I don't know about telling lies. I don't know pain and sorrow. I don't know why I should cry. I don't know what I've forgotten. And I don't know what's yet to come. But I know when I'm in love. Hey. Don't sneak up on me like that. [music playing] You're gonna get it. Come on. Come on. Tito here says-- says you're a cop. What? I'm not convinced. You know the difference between us and all the other gangs? Is the Italians deal with us. We control the guns, we control the streets. [speaking spanish] Man. What's this got to do with your jap friend, eh? Because I feel that he can deal with the tongs, we've got an inside man. You feel fucked the-- fuck that. He's a fucking cop, man. OK. OK, motherfucker. OK. OK. You make phone calls every day at the same time. If you are homeless, fuck, who the fuck do you have to contact on a daily basis? Huh? Huh? Huh? I say he's writing us all to the police, man. Answer him, Toshi. I gamble. You gamble, [speaking spanish]?? You gamble? You ain't got two nickels to rub together. You telling me you gamble? OK. [speaking spanish] OK. OK. OK. What did you bet on yesterday, huh? Huh? The daily double. Did you win or lose? I lost as usual. Too bad. So tell me who won. Six and nine. Six and nine. Six and nine. OK. [dialing] OK. Hola. [speaking spanish] Heya, man. You do the honors. Todd, what was yesterday's daily double? Thanks. Ha. Ha-ha. I trusted you. Yes you did, man. Yes you did, man. And behind your back, he's fucking your sister. Is that fucking true? Huh? Ha-ha. He's all yours. Ha-ha. Ha-ha. [speaking spanish] Let me at him. Let me at him. Let me at him. [knocking] - Who is it? - It's me. Open the door. Hey, what's the matter with you? You fucking the jap? Answer me. Are you fucking the jap? [slap] Yes I am. I'm in love with him, OK? Well, you're fucking jap boyfriend's a cop. And he's doing you to get to me in the hood. Fuck. [music playing] I'm sorry. It's OK. I'm sorry. Mr. C, please. It's Hawk. I need to see you. Not now, Hawk. In about an hour, at the Port Authority on the roof, in the limo. Right now, I got better business to attend to. Right, baby? That's right. Hey. Wake up. [grunt] MR C: Why do you want to see me? I-- I owe you an apology. We're thinking that maybe one of my guys is undercover. So if I cause any problems, I apologize. That problem has already been taken care of. What are you talking about? We hit an undercover in Central Park. We have one more to take care of. He's black and as good as dead. There was a big foul-up the other day, and I almost got whacked. It's getting too risky. I don't know if I want to do business with you or your brotherhood. What the fuck are you talking about? Go get your guns from someone else. I'm getting too old to fuck around with young punks like you in the hood. Go ahead, take a fucking walk. Where's Toshi? On the drag. Tito took him for a ride. Where's Toshi? Where'd they go? Probably the sanitation pier. That's what they take all the rats. [music playing] You gonna die, motherfucker. [laughs] Hey, I hope you're a good swimmer, Toshi. [laughter] How about sinking, huh? You any good at that? Let's go, men. Let's go. Let's go. Stupid motherfucker. [laughs] Hold it, motherfucker! Hold it! Don't move, motherfucker. Let it go. Let it go. This is between me and him, man. He's got nothing to do with it. I just talked to Mr. C. He said he whacked a cop that's snitching on us. - No. Bull shit. Bull shit and bull shit. How the fuck does he know sushi-- Toshi's not an undercover, huh? He knew who was working us. Who gives a fuck, man? I hate this motherfucker anyway. Who gives a shit what you hate. What the fuck you going to do? Man, look at yourself, man. Look at yourself, man. You lost it, man. This guy's a fucking undercover. [spits] I just said, the hood is mine! Put that fucking thing away. Emelio, Mario, get his gun. As long as I'm alive, I still run the brotherhood. You fucking crazy, man? We're blood, just you and me. [stab] [gunshot] I'm retiring you, motherfucker. [laughs] Forever. - Fuck you! [gunshot] Hawk! Hawk, hang on to me. [gunshots] [speaking spanish] I can't believe I got shot. Try not to talk. Oh God, I'm nauseous. [wretch] I always wanted to get out of the city. I guess I'm finally going to make it. Don't give up on me, Hawk! Maria always said I'd end up like this. [wretch] God damn. Tito, I always knew he'd be the one to do me in. He's been sucking up to Mr. C. Mr. C? Yeah. You got to do me a favor, T-- Toshi. Maria can't make it out there on your own. And I know she likes you very much. Promise me you'll look after her. Promise. I promise. I promise, Hawk! Hawk! Brodsky here. TOSHI: It's me, Toshi. Hey. I'm glad you called. Where you been? Hawk is dead. I'm going after them. BRODSKY: No. No, that's too dangerous. Listen. Danny Boy we'll meet you at pier 12. He'll bring the weapons. I want no dead heroes, you got that? Yes sir. Yeah, it's me. Listen, I got some good news for you. [music playing] There's no sign of Toshi. Whoa, whoa, whoa. OK. OK. OK. I think he's here. All right. All right. Ah! Ah! [gunshot] I'll be bringing in three times what Hawk made, three times. That's not enough. I expect you to expand your marketing to much bigger territory. I really don't like dealing with punks like you, but I'm going to give you a shot. Guns and drugs. They're the same thing. First, they start with handguns, and later they want to graduate to shotguns and machine guns. [laughs] Hey. I just hope you're not bullshitting me. Hey, on my life, Mr. C, on my life. Exactly. [music playing] Police. Freeze. Don't move. So you were a fucking undercover cop after all. MAN: Let's get the hell out of here. [gunfire] [alarm] So long, motherfucker. [pierce] [music playing] [sirens] Are you OK? Yeah. It's all over. Sorry to hear about Danny Boy. He was a good man. Fortunately, we got Cilerno. IAD had been tailing her for quite some time. She fell in with a bad crowd. Are they expecting something was wrong? It's too bad. She won't be any problem to us anymore. [music playing] This is not a good time.
