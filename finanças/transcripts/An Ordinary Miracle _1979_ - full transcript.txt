Mosfilm studio and the Creative Association of TV films presents a film made to the order of Gosteleradio A USUAL WONDER Part One Based on a play by Yevgenyi SCHWARZ of the same name It's her. It's her footsteps. I've been in love with my wife for 15 years. Like a schoolboy. Hello, my wife. - Are you sore with someone? - You. The boor. My God, what have I done this time? What's all that mess in the hen-house? I did that out of love. And who promised to live like everyone else? Live like everyone else! - Are you sore with someone? - You. The boor! What have I done this time? What's all that mess in the hen-house? I did that out of love. And who promised to live like everyone else? Live like everyone else... But after all I am a magician. I'm entitled to an occasional prank. You could have done something useful for the household. They brought sand to sprinkle the walks. Why don't you turn it into sugar. What kind of a prank is that? Or else turn the stones, piled up at the barn, into cheese. Cheese? That's not funny. What am I to do with you? No matter how hard I try, you're still the same crazy man. - Who are you waiting for? - No one. - Look me in the eyes. - I'm looking. Tell me the truth. What guests are we expecting today? Will those be people or ghosts, that will come to play with you? It's all right, it's all right... Soon, soon! Who are you waiting for? You think you can fool your wife? Tell me! Now! We are having very unusual guests today. This time I'm up to something more than pranks or jokes. Please don't be sore. I knew who I was marrying. It's him. It's him! I've been expecting you. Come in. Hello, son. Seat yourself at the table, have some coffee. What is your name? Bear. Bear... That nickname does not become you. It is not a nickname. 7 years ago your husband put a spell on me and made me human. He did a wonderful job. He has hands of gold. Thank you, son. Is that true? Why didn't you tell me? I forgot. I was walking in the forest... And I saw this young bear cub, funny looking chap. Broad forehead, clever eyes. - I liked him. - Stop it! I hate it when people abuse animals out of fun. They make elephants dance, lock nightingales into cages, and teach tigers swing on a swing. Life is tough, son? Yes. It's not easy to be a real man. You're laughing? I'm happy. Admiring my work. A man makes a statue out of a dead stone, and it makes him proud if it comes out beautiful. But try turning a living creature into an even more living one. That's a challenge for you! That's what I've been waiting for for many years. For many years. Turn him back into a bear this very minute, if you love me. Set him free. Don't worry! That's what he's here for - to be turned into a bear again. I'm glad. Will you do it right here? No, that's no fun. Everything will be wonderful! It will be different. It will be absolutely different. - It will be different. - Will it happen now? No, it's not that simple. I will turn back into a bear, when a Princess... falls in love with me and kisses me. - Did you think of that? - I think it's good, don't you? - But that's awful! - I didn't please you again! - Did you think about her? - It's healthy to fall in love. She will fall in love, and he will turn into an animal. - That's nothing unusual. - He will run away into the forest. That happens too, they run away. You will leave a girl who is in love with you, son? Soon as she sees that I'm a bear, she will fall out of love. Not that I want to frighten you, but it is a dangerous game. I though I could take anything, but this time I'm afraid. But what can happen? You're afraid she won't fall in love? Of course she will! Look, how charming he is. What if... It's too late anyway! I've arranged it so that one of the kings... would want to make a detour and visit our house. He's on his way here now. Go hide yourself, son. We will meet them ourselves. I'll call you when the time comes. - I don't believe it! A king! - Wait till you see him! He's a boor and a churl! He'll make a nuisance of himself and order us about. Good day. My friends, I am a King. Good day, Your Majesty. For some reason I found your house extremely attractive. So allow me to visit with you for a couple of days. I must warn you, we're a troublesome bunch. I am an impossible person. A tyrant, a despot. Insidious and unforgiving. Someone-come here! You, for instance! Say hello to them. See, what I'm doing? And the interesting thing is, it's not my fault. That's the truth. Now beat it! I'm not to blame! It's the ancestry. Great grandfathers, grand-uncles and all sorts of aunts, all my ancestors always behaved like complete pigs. And now I have to pay for their past. What can I say? Parasites! Pardon my language. Parasites! That's the word. By my nature I am kind and gentle. I'm into poetry, prose, music, art, dishing. I like cats. But occasionally I can pull something weird. - Like this, for instance. - Joker! You're a funny man yourself. Mistress, give us three goblets. It is the King's vintage wine that's 300 years old. Let's drink to our acquaintance! Here's to us! Bottoms up! - Don't drink. - Why? - You don't respect your guest? - Quiet, you're not at home. Don't order me about! I blink my eye, and the ministers will act, and express their condolences, and that'll be it! Don't! The wine is poisoned. - Well listen to the scoundrel! - Then you drink first. All right, the wine is poisoned. Why through it away? Pour it back into the bottle. This is high quality poison. Hard to get. Can always come in handy. - Shame on you, Your Majesty! - I'm not to blame! - Who is? - My uncle. He would often talk too much, slander himself, and with his delicate and vulnerable soul, you know, to spare himself the agony of remorse, he would afterwards poison his vis-?vis. - Bastard. - Animal! - You ought to be ashamed. - Oh, don't start. Now you're gonna say, I must be responsible for my own actions. And not put the blame on friends, neighbors or relatives. I'm only human! It's more than I can do! I am a King. Just your ordinary King. There are thousands like me. We understand one another. Why pretend?! And don't frown! We're alive and kicking! We're staying here! Courtiers! Make yourselves comfortable! Put the music on! If I may ask, King, is the Princess also... Of course not! She's not like that. She's kind and sweet. Living with me is hard on her. Her mother died when she was only 7 minutes old. - So don't you be rude to her. - Your Majesty! I stop being a King when I think of her or see her. Dear friends! I'm so happy that I love... my child so much! How funny and crazy, Absurd and untimely... And how wonderful! Without any reason or Meaning At all! There comes a day, There strikes an hour, There comes a moment, There comes the right time, And the connection breaks. Granite boils, Ice catches fire, Light down Knocks you off your feet. What madness?! Weeds blossom, The old owl sings like a nightingale, And even the thinnest of threads Can not be cut in half By a steel blade, By a steel blade! How funny and crazy, Absurd and untimely And how wonderful! Without any reason or Meaning At all! There comes a time, And it brings Shivers and fear, And a secret fever, Power and delight, Pain and laughter, Light and shadow, All thrown into one dire, Into one burning flame. What madness?! And out of this mirage, Out of nothing, Out of my own wild fantasies Appears someone's face, And it acquires shape and Color, Flesh and passion, Flesh and passion! How funny and crazy, Absurd and untimely, And how wonderful! Without any reason or Meaning At all! She is extraordinary! Not at all like a King's daughter. She's extraordinary! Not at all like a King's daughter. I used to come to the nursery and, believe it or not, I felt better about myself. Or I would sit there signing a death sentence, and laugh at her little pranks. I know, I'm a self-centered bastard! I got so used to warming my heart being next to her, that I started to protect her from anything that could stain her pure soul. Surely you know what a royal court is like. Every day they strangle their own brothers and sisters. That's right, strangle them. In other words, there's this usual everyday life going on. But once you enter the wing of the princess, there's pleasant conversation, poetry, music. It heals your soul. And that tranquil world collapsed because of a trifle. I remember it clearly. It was Saturday, I was doing my homework, looking through cavils of my ministers, When there was a knock at the door. My daughter was by my side embroidering a scarf for my Birthday. It was all so calm and peaceful, birds were singing. Then the Master of Ceremonies breaks the bad news. Says, her aunt, the Duchess, was coming to visit. I always hated her shrill voice. So I tell him to tell her, we're not in. That's not anything unusual for us, because we're ordinary people. But my poor little girl fainted. "Her daddy told a lie!" That's how it all started. She became thoughtful and looked bored. I didn't know what to do. Then the genes of my great granddad awakened in me. Whatever trouble happened, he didn't do anything at all, but waited for it to pass. When they were strangling his beloved wife before his eyes, he stood there and begged: "Hold on, it'll pass". - Nice man! - Oh sure! But then I woke up one night and I said: Harness the horses! And at sunrise we were already rushing in the direction of the Carpathian Mountains. We don't know anyone here, so you will have to bear with us, until we build a castle with all the conveniences, a garden, a prison cell, and a playground. - I'm afraid... - Don't be. Your Majesty, I will show you your rooms. Careful, watch your step. This way, your Majesty. Just imagine him turning into a wild beast before her very eyes. - It's good to fall in love! - I won't allow this. That would be painful even for a mature woman. - Tell me it's a joke. - It's too late! No! I will ask the Bear to wait, until we find another princess. I need to talk to you in private. In the garden. Quick! I'm sorry if I hurt you, charming young lady. What is it? Did I scare you so much? No. I'm just a little shaken. I have never been called "charming young lady" before. I didn't want to offend you. I'm not offended. It's just that I can't tell a lie. If I see a charming young lady, I tell her so. - Are you the owner's son? - No, I am an orphan. Me too. I mean, my father is alive, but my mother died when I was only 7 minutes old. I'm sure you have many friends. Why would you say that? I think, everyone should love someone like you. I think, everyone should love someone like you. You are extraordinary, you are gentle. Have I offended you now? No. Then I will tell you, that you are beautiful. And that I came to like you. Very much. The moment I saw you. Do you find me funny? No. I think, everyone should love someone like you. You are so extraordinary, so gentle. - Have I offended you now? - No. Then I will tell you, that you are beautiful. And that I came to like you. At first sight. Do you find me funny? No. You must be tired and hungry. There's milk fresh from a cow. Have some. - Is it some holiday today? - I don't know, maybe. - Are you one of the King's suite? - No. Then one of the Princess's suite? What if I am the Princess? What is it? You grew so pale! No, you can't be the Princess. No! I roamed the world. I saw many princesses. You don't look like any one of them. Please... Don't tease me. Touch on any subject but this one. My god! I forgot all about them. The suite has arrived. Yesterday's homely faces. Let's hide from them. Run! Fast! My god! Why is it that I cry and laugh like a child! How dare you? I begged you not to. Hello there, beautiful! Sorry for the intrusion. I hope I'm not interfering with anything? You want me to leave? No, of course not! Please do sit down. - May I put down my bundle? - Well of course! You are so kind. What a charming cozy home! There's a handle for the spit, and a hook for the cattle. You must be the King's cook! No. I am the King's First Minister. - Who? - The King's First Minister. There was a time when everyone recognized me. I was so brilliant, so grand! Experts say, it was difficult to tell, who had more stature: me or the King's cats. Now I dance stupid dances for everyone's amusement. I'm no longer good for anything else. Am I any good? - I don't think so. - I don't think so either. I'd say, quite mediocre. What brought you to such a poor state? It's the traveling, my lady. For certain reasons we, a group of courtiers, were torn away from our habitual atmosphere and sent away to a foreign land. And to add insult to injury there's this tyrant. - The King? - No, of course not! We've gotten used to his whims. The tyrant is the Minister Administrator. He alone knows how to travel, get us horses, feed everyone. He does a rotten job, but thinks everyone else is no good. Only don't tell him I was complaining. Or he will leave me without dessert. Why don't you tell the king? As they say in the business circles, he services and serves the King so well, he doesn't want to hear anything about it. What a shame! What a disgrace! What a bedlam! What is this anyway? He'll starve everyone to death. I wish he were dead! But that's wishful thinking! What can you expect of the parasite! What do I need my head for, If I hadn't washed it For three days! Where's the soap? Where's The bath? Where? Where's the cream? Even A shaving cream would do. One who economizes on Being clean Is either a thief, or A swine! He is either a thief, Or a pig! Where is the soap? Where is The bath? Where? Where is the cream? Where? One who economizes on Being clean Is either a thief, or a pig! Damn him, when will this torture end? We will all become mangy before long, before this venomous creature will deign to give us soap. Allow me to introduce the First Court Dame! Maids of honor, Orynthia and Amanda! It's outrageous! Today His Excellency, damn him, refused to give us soap, powder and perfume! I am sure he sold all that to the natives! When we left, he only had a hat box with a sandwich and old torn drawers, and now he has 33 small coffers and 22 suitcases! - Would you like to take a bath? - But we don't have soap! - We have soap and hot water. - Hot water?! She's a saint! A bath! Memories of our old settled life! - What utter joy! - Tss! He's coming! He's almost here! Please, not a word! I didn't tell you anything! Hello. - I said, hello. - I already saw you today. - Where is our luggage? - Look at these people! They only think about themselves! If you bother me again, I'll leave you without your lunch. That goes for everyone else too. 4 pounds to the courtiers. Minus 2... 3 pounds to the King. Minus one and a half. 1 pound to the Princess. Minus half a pound. All in all 6 pounds today so far. Not bad. - At midnight. - What? Come by the barn, you won't regret it. I don't have time for courtship. You're an attractive woman. I am an extremely attractive man. Why waste time? I'll be there at midnight. - How dare you?! - Always, darling. You're crazy? On the contrary, I'm as sane as a man can be. - You are a bastard. - Yes. Who isn't? Today, for instance, I see a butterfly flying. Small head, no brains. Flips her winds-tit, tit, tit. Can't be any more stupid. The sparrow was no better. The birch tree-a dim-wit. The oak tree-a moron. The river-an imbecile. The clouds-idiots. All horses-traitors. All people-swindlers. What to do? The world is such, we shouldn't think twice. It is good if there is a woman around. A lady, a dame, signora, Le femme. And the most important thing For a woman is her good honor, When there's a Man around. And everywhere, especially Here, Where nature is tranquil And innocent, And the butterfly goes: Tit-tit-tit, And the sparrow chases her: Tat-tat-tat, And he catches the baby: Dang-dang-dang, Yummy-yummy-yummy, And goes: split-split-split. The butterfly flips her wings: Tit-tit-tit, The sparrow chases her; Tat-tat-tat, He catches the baby: Dang-dang-dang, Yummy-yummy-yummy! And goes: split-split-split! You are my angel, You are my ideal, My shining star, My luscious berry, Your teeth are pearls, Your lips-corals. Your breasts and your smile Are not bad either. I've never met anyone like you, And I want to correct that mistake. The butterfly flips her wings: Tit-tit-tit, And the sparrow chases her: Tat-tat-tat, He catches the baby: Dang-dang-dang, Yummy-yummy-yummy, and he Goes: split-split-split. The butterfly flips her wings: Tit-tit-tit, And the sparrow chases her: tat-tat-tat, He catches the baby: Dang-dang-dang, Yummy-yummy-yummy, and then he goes: Split-split-split. So you will come then? That is out of the question. Wait till husband turns you into a rat. - What is your husband? - A magician. You should have told me. I was wrong. Blew my top. Let's consider this a misunderstanding. I ask your permission to let me redress my wrong. Music! I say, I really like it here! This house is so full of good attitude and love! I could take it for myself. Honest to god! It's a good thing I came here. At home I would most probably lock you away in the Tower. That's the one in the Market Square. Awesome place. You remember? Hot in the daytime, cold at night. The inmates suffer so much, even the warden cries. Cries out of pity, you understand? I could jail him for that. - Sure! And take his house! - Monster. I am a King-from head to toe! He thinks there are better kings than I am. We're all monsters! Alike like twin brothers. My lady, please. Where is my daughter, anyway? The Princess asked us to leave her alone. Her Highness wanted to pick flowers... in solitude. How could she leave my child all by herself? There can be snakes in the grass, she may catch cold. - How come? - Because the river is cold. There she is. Safe and sound. There she is! My daughter! My only child! She's smiling! - Now she's contemplating! - She smiled again! What a charming smile! Who is that young man with her? I can see she likes him! Then I like him too. - Are his parents still living? - They passed away. That's wonderful! - Any brothers and sisters? - None. I shall grant him a title and make him rich, and let him travel with us. He can't be all too bad, since my girl likes him so much. - Is he a good boy? - Very! But... No "buts"! I haven't seen my girl so happy for years. There can be no "buts"! Today I'm having a ball. I shall be joyful and good-natured, and allow myself just a few harmless pranks. Get the chinaware ready. I shall break plates today. Take the bread out of the barn. I will set the barn on fire. Hello, everyone. I saw all of you today, but it seems it was ages ago. Ladies and gentlemen! This young man is my best friend. I always envied girls, who had brothers, but now I think it was silly of me, because I like him more than a brother. They fight with brothers, but I couldn't fight with him. He loves the things that I love. He understands me and I understand him, like myself. You see, he's sore with me? You know why? Because I didn't tell him I was a Princess. And he hates princesses. Yes, that's true! You know, I would want him to see, how different I am from all the other princesses. I hate them too, darling. Don't be so terrified. You're scaring me! Would you like me to kiss you? No. Not ever! Not ever! I have to go. You will never see me again. Get him! Stop him! You know him well. Was it something I said? No, sweetheart. You didn't do anything wrong. He didn't like it when I said about the brothers. I must have been too straightforward! And then... How could I have forgotten myself! The most shameful part! I offered to kiss him. - And he... - He saddled his horse and went away! On that crazy horse of his! Off into the mountains! With no road lying ahead. Daughter... Where are you going? Come back! Come back! Executioner! Get ready! Courtiers! Say your prayers! The Princess locked herself in her room. You will be executed. Your Majesty, I think... The sand-glass! Fast! I shall spare the life of anyone, who, while the sand runs in the sand-glass, will teach me, what to do with the Princess. Think! Think! The sand runs fast. Take your turns, and speak plainly and clearly. The First Minister! Your Majesty! In my opinion, parents should not interfere in the love lives of their children. You will die first. Speak, my lady. Many years ago, Your Majesty, I stood at the window, and a young man on a black horse was rushing away along a mountainous path. It was a quiet moonlit night. - And a clatter of hoofs... - Get to the point, you fool. - The sand is running. - Don't interrupt her. - But there are many of us. - And only one sand-glass. What will be left for us? Go on. I never saw him again. And I married someone else. And here I am, alive and at Your Majesty's service. You too will have your head chopped off. Your turn. The best way to console the Princess - is to let her marry someone, who is loyal to the King, has some experience in life and an administrator's skills, and who is one of the King's suite. Are you talking about the executioner? God no! I don't know him that well. You will. My child! What is it? You are frightening me? Where are you going? I won't tell anyone. Good girl! Child, we are going with you! Father! I love you so much. Don't be sore with me, but I'm leaving alone. Stop her! Fast! I swear! I will kill anyone who follows me. Remember this. I have my own life now, and I want to be left alone. Stop her! Stop her at any cost! Stop her! Stop her! What a girl! In the mountains she'll catch cold and lose her way! she will fall off the horse, tangle her foot in the stirrup! Don't just stand there! Go after her! She will shoot anyone, who follows her! I will follow her, hiding behind big stones. What are you talking about? I shall crawl in the grass like a snake. But I shall not abandon her! - Follow me! - Wait! Are you happy now? Lousy weather! All my life I lived here, on the mountain peak, amidst eternal frost, but I don't remember such a hurricane. It's a good thing this tavern was built strong. Strong like a castle. Tavern called "Emily". Emily... She must be grey-haired by now. And probably happily married. But I still dream... of hearing her voice one day. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen! Please come in and make yourselves comfortable! Sit by the fire! Don't cry, my lady. I will help you. There, hot wine is good for you. May I know who you are? Even though... I'm used to travelers not telling their names. Nonsense! I'm a King. Good evening, Your Majesty. Good evening, innkeeper. I am very unhappy. That happens. My daughter is gone. Idiots. Spongers. They left her unattended. She fell in love, they had a fight. She put on men's clothes and disappeared. Spongers! Idlers! Who lives in this tavern? A famous hunter and his apprentices. Hunters? Maybe they saw her? They're hunting everywhere around this place. This hunter does not hunt any more. - What does he do then? - Certifies his skills. He already got himself 50 diplomas, that prove that he is famous. - What does he do in life? - Nothing. To prove you're famous! That can be a very tiresome business. The hell with him! You, awaiting death penalty! We're off! - Oh, my god! - Take to the road! To go up into the mountains in such weather! That's a killer. We have no choice. There's the key to your room. - What will I do there? - Do nothing. And at sunrise we will set off in search of her. You will all get your keys. Everyone should get their sleep and prepare for tomorrow! Follow me! Don't be afraid, there's no one here. If those are the hunters, I will kill you. Hunters everywhere! I hate them! Their wives start discussing hunting! Apprentice! Did you deliver the letters? - I did. - To the Chief of the Hunting Ground? Yes, sir. And when I was coming back I saw a fox's trails. The hell with it! That's a waste of time, and meanwhile envious people are masterminding a plot against me. - Maybe they're not? - Sure they are. Everyone's against me. Let them! Why don't we shoot us some game! Let them do whatever they want, we'll be the winners. We'll be the good guys, and they'll be the bad guys. You fool! They'll scrutinize my every shot. They'll say I shot the fox same way as last year. And that I didn't introduce any innovations into hunting. And what if I miss? Me, who never missed in his whole life. You better not say anything, or I'll kill you. - Where's our new apprentice? - He's cleaning his gun. That a boy! You always praise every new apprentice. It's the hunter! Open up, you fool! - Is this a hotel? - The owner will be with you in a minute. - Are you a hunter? - God forbid! I don't like hunters. Me too. I hate them! Even though I'm one myself. A famous hunter. Too bad. Not to mention small game, in my lifetime, I shot 500 deer, 500 wild goats, 400 wolves, and 99 bears. Killing bears is no better than killing children. Did you see their claws? They're shorter than a hunter's dagger. - They're so aggressive! - Not if you don't tease them. I'm so enraged, I'm speechless. We will have to shoot. My new apprentice! Get my rifle! - I will kill you now. - I don't care. Let's get on with it then! There, my new apprentice, watch and learn. Now this boor and ignoramus will be killed, for he knows nothing about art. Very well! But why don't you eat these sausages first. I shall not eat when this boor is staring at me. Take these sausages to my room, and I will kill him after dinner. I beg your pardon, do you have a sister? You remind me of a woman, I have to forget. Where are you going? I don't want to remind you of something you need to forget. And this voice! The voice is just like hers! You must be hallucinating! Perhaps. My vision is hazy. I spent three days in the saddle. When I was passing by this tavern, my horse started crying. What did you flee from, like a criminal? - I fled from love. - What a funny story! Please don't laugh! There was something I found out about this girl... And when she said she would kiss me... Foolish girl! How stupid of her! - You don't dare say that! - She deserves it! - Boaster and windbag! - Who, me? To boast of his victories in front of a stranger! - She's a fool! - Don't say that about her! - What did you say? - She's a fool! Impudent people ought to be punished. - Defend yourself. - I'm at your service. Daddy! Princess! It is you! I'm so happy! Why are you here? I followed you for 3 days. Yes! To tell you that I don't care about you in the least! I had no intention of kissing you! Or of falling in love with you! You hurt me so much, that I want revenge. I will prove to you, that I don't care. I'll die but I'll prove it. Run away... I have to run away! Miserable bear! Run away, and save her and myself! Coward! Coward! How funny, how crazy, How untimely, And how wonderful! Without any reason and Without any meaning... At all! There comes a day, There strikes an hour, There comes a moment, There comes a time, And the connection breaks, Granite boils, Ice catches fire, Light down knocks You off your feet, What madness! Weeds start to blossom, The old owl sings like a Nightingale, And even the thinnest of Threads... Can not be cut in half By a steel dagger! By a steel dagger! How funny, how crazy, How untimely, And how wonderful! Without any reason And without any meaning... At all!

Do you hear how quiet it is? I tried to go out, but I couldn't. We're buried under the snow. - I can't leave then? - No. Then lock me in. I can't meet with her. I love her. The Princess? - How did you know? - I just asked. Is she in this tavern? Yes, disguised in a man's outfit. Now I understand how she insulted me. - Did you hear what she said? - No, I haven't. But I've lived a long life, and I understand everything. I won't say another word! I thought I was talking to a young man who looked like her. That was a mean thing to do! It is over now! - Lock me in. - Here's the key. I won't lock you in. I wouldn't want you to break my new lock. Good night. Where will you find peace? You won't. Lock yourself in a monastery. - solitude will remind you of her. Set up a tavern by the road. - every knock at the door will remind you of her. Damn! The candle keeps blowing out. Well of course it is. I was thinking of you. Emily... Well I'll be damned! Do you recognize me? Emil? Yes. That was the name of a young man whom a very mean girl forced to flee to no-man's land. Don't look at me like that. My face is wind-beaten. I see you like you were 20 years ago. I forgot how to cry. I became mean and callous. I smoke sailors' tobacco, devilish stuff. That's what became of me. You were always like that. Stubborn and proud by nature. It's just a new form it acquired, that's all. That's the whole difference. Damn! At every crowded masquerade... I would recognize you under any mask. You remember? Yes. My lady, don't you think The weather is better Than ever? I will answer, my lord... I do find... That the weather is quite Unusual indeed. My lady, why is it... That this evening is so Extraordinary wonderful? My lord, perhaps... It is not easy to explain, But it is probably because You are with me tonight. Oh, my lady, When we are together, All the flowers blossom In the meadows, I will say this, my lord... It is time for me to go, But I can't hurt the feelings Of the little flowers. I find it pleasing and Amusing, That you like me, And I like you even more. That is wonderful! Ding-ding-dong! And this is just a mask time has put on you. Why? Oh, why? Why were you mad at him then? - Why? - You kissed him. He passed away long ago. But why did you kiss him? Only to avenge you. You danced with the general's daughter. - Dancing is not a sin. - No. You were whispering something in her ear. I was whispering: one, two, three... She couldn't follow the rhythm. - Funny. - So funny I want to cry. Can you forgive my wicked self for kissing him? I am so happy to see you. How stupid. I forgot how to cry. Let's talk about something else. There is one important matter. There are two young people in this house, who will die if we don't do something. The Princess and the young man, because of whom she ran away. - They met? - And had a fight. Hit the drums! - Blow the pipes! - What pipes? Don't pay attention, it's just a court habit. Get your swords out! Prepare for battle! Get up and going! I get it. Emily was married to the palace commandant. Hit the drums! Get up and going! He didn't know who he was married to! May his soul rest in peace. - Did you see her? - Yes. She must be pale and weak? She's tanned and running around dressed like a boy. - Is he here? - Yes. - Still in love? - Very much so. - Hurting? - Indeed! He deserves it, the bastard! Heart drops, fast! My apprentice is not feeling well. Give me those drops! Quick! - He's not feeling well. - This one? Oh really! He won't notice it if I die. The new one! He won't eat, won't drink and won't answer questions. It is my daughter! Oh my god! - Who is your daughter? - The new apprentice. - It's the Princess in disguise. - Well I'll be damned! I almost hit her. Can't you tell a boy from a girl? - And what about you? - What? All right, enough of that. Where's the Princess? Hey you! Don't shout at me! My job puts me under great pressure. I don't like being shouted at. If you want to show me my mistakes, compliment me first. Scoundrel! He's a King. Forgive me, Your Majesty. I'll forgive you later. Where's the Princess? Sitting at the fireplace, looking at burning coals. Take me to her. I always remember your stories about hunting. Please be careful! You have to take care of yourself for our sake! We love you so much, Your Majesty! She'll open fire. The Princess said she will shoot anyone, who... She won't shoot her own father. I don't think so. I doubt it she will spare even her own father. Now he will shout at me again. Jesus, my throat is sore! There's no job more hazardous than the job of a courtier. How true. I am in terrible anguish! I warn everyone. She is sitting there, all sad and miserable. There is no way I can help her. That's how it is. Who will dare to approach her, talk to her, console and comfort her? Who? - She will open fire. - That's for sure. So what?! You've been sentenced to death anyway. - Who will go first? - Allow me. That's a boy! No, you can't! It's better if one of her close ones went there. For one who is in love the closest seem the most distant. The world has changed, but they are still the same. Gee, I haven't thought about that. But I will not cancel my order, because I am a stubborn tyrant. I feel the genes of my aunt awakening in me now. She was a hopeless fool. Give me a hat and a scrap of paper. We shall draw lots. we shall draw lots. Ready. Whoever draws the one with the cross, goes to the Princess. She is armed. Let me talk to the Princess. - I know what to tell her. - My answer is "no". I'm having one of my fits of stubbornness. Am I a King or not? First Minister, you draw first. - Alas! - Thank god! There's no cross here. Why did you say "alas", you idiot? Quiet! Your turn, my lady. - I have to go! - Congratulations! And may your soul rest in peace. Show me that paper. You liar! Look at these people! All they know is how to cheat on their King. Next! - Next! - What are you shouting for? Draw the lot! What are you doing? Are you crazy? Open your eyes, the hat is right here. Alas, no cross. How unfortunate! - Next! - Come on, show me that. - What? - Give me that scrap of paper. - No cross? - No. - What's this then? - You call that a cross? Nonsense! This is not a cross? This looks more like an "X". No, this is not an "X", it is your lot. Go ahead. Your Majesty! Be reasonable. What do you want me to risk my life for? For a whim, for some kind of a stupid prejudice? For love! What love? Did you see it? Don't be selfish and don't keep us waiting. When a smuggler crosses a canyon clinging to a perch, or a merchant sails across the ocean in a frail boat, that is understandable, that is noble. These people are making money. But what's there for me in this? What you call love, my lady, can be a lot of fun and a little absurd. - But to risk my life! - Shut up, you despicable fool! Tell her not to abuse me. What are you staring at me! As if you really believe what you're saying. I've seen enough of noble sufferers, and the torturers of human souls. They push the deceived fools to their sure death. It is them who invented love! There is no such thing as love, Your Majesty! Trust the word of an experienced man. All right, you said your final word. Now go. Don't expect me to pardon you. Go, or I'll shoot you myself. Why did I listen to him! Now he awakened the aunt in me. The one who could be easily convinced by anyone. The poor thing was married 18 times, not to mention fleeting affairs. Maybe love doesn't exist after all? Maybe the Princess is suffering from a case of severe angina? - Your Majesty. - Shut up! You are an honorable and devout woman. Let us listen to the young. You... Beat it. For good. May his soul rest in peace. - She may have missed! - Never! She's my student! Quiet! I personally am happy. My daughter behaves like all normal people. She's feeling low, and she starts shooting around. She missed! - Why are you still alive? - Because I fired that shot. That's right. - Who at? - At the Princess. Oh, she's alive, don't worry. Hey you! Get me an executioner's block and a shot of Vodka. Vodka for me, the rest for him! Move it! Not so fast. Listen here, father. The princess is my fianc? He's crazy. Not in the least! Tell me everything, or I'll kill you! I like to tell about deals, that worked out fine. I go there, I open the door And wait to be shot at. I don't want to die, just like anyone else. So I stand there, I stand and I think, I think something like that: Now is my hour of death. And life is so good, Oh, so good, And I don't want to die, Just like anyone else. The girl jumps up, She rushes to the door, I grab at my gun, And I fire a shot at her. What was I to do? I fire at her, At the sweet little lady, Because of the circumstances, Not out of spite. She didn't shake, She didn't shiver, But instead she said In her gentle voice... I said to myself that I will Marry anyone who comes first, I don't really care who. So you have come first, She said. Yes, that's what she said To me, the sweet girl. You are the first one I see, And I am yours forever. And in the midst of All that fire and smoke I planted a kiss on her tender lips. Please stop, or I will kill you. No problem! They already tried to kill me today. - And look what happened! - One hell of a mess! Look for some medicine in the first aid kit. I nearly fainted, and all I got left is feelings. Delicate, fragile, feelings I can't explain. Is it music or flowers I want, or to stab someone? I know, something strange has happened to me. And I'm afraid to face reality. Daddy! - Good evening, daddy. - Good evening. I'm getting married. Who to, my child? To this one. - Give me your hand. - With great pleasure. Don't play the fool, or I'll shoot you. You're OK! I'm proud of you! The wedding is to take place right now. A wedding is always a happy occasion. Why postpone it! My sword! I ask you to be my wife. I am young and healthy. And I will make you happy. What is this? - Will you marry me? - Don't answer him. You can do this, and I can't? I swore to marry the first person that comes by. - Me too! - I don't care. Ladies! You will help me put on my wedding gown. Gentlemen! You will help me set the table. Think of a pretext and make the Princess come back. I will bring her back by force if I have to! I ask you to marry me. Which one of us are you proposing to? There's two of us. Sorry, I haven't noticed. To come near two people in love when they're fighting can be lethally dangerous. - Have pity on the girl! - Does anyone have pity on me? A couple of kind gentle words, and you will both be happy! Tell her you were wrong and kiss her. - Don't be stubborn. - No! Don't waste time! I hear Emily's footsteps. She's bringing the Princess. Ladies and gentlemen! Please accept my congratulations on this happy occasion! The wedding of the Princess and the Minister will take place right now. Emily, what are you saying? That's an order! What's gotten into you, Emily? Don't touch me! What's with me? - What's with you, Emily? - Don't touch me! I'm on duty! I'm doing my job. What's gotten into me? I'm only doing my job! God damn me! Everything's ready, Your Majesty. As honorary Saint, honorary Martyr, and honorary Pope of our kingdom I take it upon myself to perform this pleasant duty. I ask the bride and groom to join hands. No! What do you mean, "no"? Go ahead, say it. Leave us alone, I have to talk to the Princess. The impudent young man! Boor! What a boor! Look at that boor! Please leave, everyone. And leave us alone. I think we should go. I would leave, but I'm dying to know what he will say to her. Please, let's do what the young man asks. We can do that, the more so that we can eavesdrop through the keyhole. Let's go, gentlemen! I will tell you the truth. Our encounter brought us disaster. We shouldn't have fallen in love. It is terrible. We fell in love. We fell in love... We fell in love with each other. If you kiss me, I will turn into a beast. I will turn into a beast. If I kiss you... I will turn into a bear. - A bear? - Yes, and I don't want that. I couldn't bare it. I swore that sooner I'd die than hurt you. Forgive me. - The moment I kiss you? - Yes. And you will walk around the room in silence, like in a cage? Yes. And you will never talk to me in a human voice? No. How terrible that this should end in this way! Father! Father! - Father, he... - I know. I was eavesdropping, daughter. How terrible! Let's leave, father. Something's happening inside me, something frightening and kind. It's scary! Maybe we shouldn't send him away? Look at how others live. After all, he's a bear, not a ferret. We could tame him, brush his hair. He could dance for us once in a while. No! I love him too much for that. Good-bye forever. Forever. Let's say good-bye In a soft voice, Say good-bye in a low Voice, Say good-bye with a light Heart. A week or two, And we'll get over it. Everything will remain In the past. Even though it is sad! It is senseless and Meaningless! Oh, how good it would be to Start all over again! But that is impossible, That is unthinkable, Don't even dream of it, Forget it. Let's go back to our lunches, Back to our clothes. Fill our days with little cares. It is easier that way, It is much more simple, Isn't it? And it hurts less, Isn't it? Let's not invent ways, Let's not count on our destiny, It's not worth the effort, Believe me. That's true, gentlemen. Not ever, not in your dreams. It will never be. Oh, how charming, Oh, how good it was, It was, and it is no more. It was, and it is no more. I brought them to this hotel, Heaped up all entrances and exits with snow. I was so proud of my resourcefulness. And you didn't kiss her. Ladies and gentlemen, the hotel is closing down. I'm leaving. The keys! I'll lock the place myself. Go tell the hunter to hurry. He's packing his diplomas. How dared you not to kiss the girl? How could you do that? You know what that would lead to. I don't! You don't love her. That's not true! You don't love her, otherwise the power of passion would have taken over! Who can tell what will happen, when someone is seized with strong noble emotions? Poor unarmed people overthrow kings! Out of love for their fellow brothers. Out of love for their nation soldiers defy death. Men of wisdom rise to the sky and plunge into hell. Out of love for Truth. And what have you done out of love for a woman? I gave her up. Once in a lifetime there comes a day, when everything lovers do, works. You missed your chance. So long. I won't help you any more. I lost interest in you. Want to kill your 100th bear? I will find the princess and I will kiss her. And I will turn into a bear! I see. A 100th bear? Sounds tempting! Interesting idea. I hate to abuse your kindness. Don't feel awkward, I volunteered to be your victim. - What about the Princess? - She will be happy. Well as they say, the Art demands sacrifices. - How true! - Thank you, my friend! I am starting to forget that tune. It's all right. You wrote a bad story. It's time to forget it. Time will come and you will write another beautiful one! A merry one! No. I don't think I can. This was my last story. - What does the doctor say? - What does the doctor say? That the Princess may die. We don't believe that. That would be too much. - You promised to forget. - All right, I will. Coffee, please. No use thinking about something, that can't be brought back. We promise, we won't. - When did he come back? - He didn't. It was the Hunter. No one knows, where the bear is. - Is he hunting? - Of course not! He is busy writing a book on the theory of hunting. - When will it come out? - No one knows. He's only written a few chapters so far. He's in charge of the King's Hunting. Recently married maid of honor Amanda. They have a daughter too. Name Bullet. The hunter's apprentice married Orynthya. They have a boy. They called him Target. - Did you invite them? - Orynthya with her son? They never wait for an invitation. They come whenever they please. Just like you. And feel quite at home here. He's busy and he doesn't feel well. And he promised, that's over. - You understand? - I do. But I can't do otherwise. They can't. And I can't do without them. Every story has to have an end. Some kind of an end. Sad, happy, funny, stupid. Whatever. But there has to be an end. They will all come back here, all except for the Bear. I don't want to see him. I erased him from my memory. Amanda with her daughter! Yes... The princess is suffering, but life goes on its usual way. Yes! The dish here is cheaper than at home. But beef is the same price. What about vegetables? The vegetables are unbelievable! They lease pumpkins to poor families. They live inside and they feed on them. They tried to rent watermelons too, but they're too damp. Let's say good-bye In a soft voice, Let's say good-bye With a light heart. A week or two, And we will get over it, Everything will remain In the past, You know very well... What's going on. You could help us. The Administrator became a Prince, and he prevents the Bear from seeing the Princess. It is not the Administrator. - It is me! - I don't believe you. I'm only doing it to make these lazy people do something. What a shame. Don't be sore with me, my lady. It was all my fault in the first place. A Minister's duty is to report the truth to the King. But I was afraid to grieve His Majesty. The King must know the truth. Hello! What a beautiful morning! How is everything? How is the Princess? All right, don't bother to answer. I know everything's well. There, look! - Your Majesty... - Don't! Farewell. - Listen to me! - I want to sleep. If you won't help your daughter, than who will? Don't you see what's going on around here? A swindler and an impudent man without a heart and a mind has seized power in the Kingdom. Everything and everyone serve his purse. His people are all around the place, carrying bales with goods from place to place. You have to order to oust this the Prince-Administrator, and the Princess will feel better, and she will no longer be threatened by this foul wedding. - Your Majesty! - No. - I can't do anything. - But why? Why? Why! Because I am degenerating! I say, you are a fool. You have to read books, then you'll know, you can't ask a King more than he can do! The Princess will die. Let her die. If I feel that something like that is coming on to me, I'll kill myself. I keep poison especially for that purpose. I tried it on my partner just the other day. We were playing a game of cards. The stuff worked wonders! He died without noticing it. Why all the shouting?! - You needn't worry about me. - We worry about the Princess. You're not worrying about your King? No, Your Excellency! - What did you call me? - Your Excellency. You addressed the greatest of all kings by a general's title? - That is a riot! - Yes I have raised my voice against you. I'm standing up to you! And you are not the greatest of all kings! Just an outstanding one, that's all. What, are you gonna bite me? Outstanding, but not more! And you're not worthy of the title "honorary Saint". You may be a hermit, but you're no saint. - Call the executioner! - He won't come. He writes poems for the Administrator's newspaper. - You're not coming? - Nope. Call the Administrator Minister! No respect! But why? For what reason? Who dares to mistreat the ruler, our little homely King! They don't show me any respect, they want me to get rid of you. The lousy plotters with their intrigues. - They're scaring me. - What with? They say the Princess will die of love. What utter nonsense! Gibberish, as I call it. Our family doctor, mine and the King's, examined the Princess and reported on her health condition He found no symptoms of any love disease. That's first. And second... All love illnesses are a mere trifle, and a cause for jokes, but they're nothing lethal and easily curable. If you don't neglect them. - What's this talk about death? - That's what I'm saying. The doctor knows better! The doctor is certain, the Princess will get well soon. - Must be the wedding fever. - As they call it. As I call it. - Here! - What is it? - The doctor ran away! - That's impossible! I went to see him about the calming drops, and I find rooms unlocked, drawers open and wardrobe empty. And a note on the table. Don't show it to me. I'm afraid! How do you like that?! No executioner, no gendarmes! You are pigs, and disloyal at that! Don't follow me! I won't listen to you! I am not listening! - Show me that note. - Read it to me. "Only a miracle can save the princess... "You make her suffer, but I will be the one you will blame. "Doctors are human beings too, they want to live. Good-bye." Damn! The traitor! How inopportunely! Doctor! Call him and say it is all his fault. Quick! No, please, don't stand up, my friends. Today is such an extraordinary day! Today whatever I try to do works. Things, that I thought were lost, somehow appear again. If I think about the past, only the best comes to mind. In this way life must be saying good-bye to me. Did they tell you I am going to die today? But Princess... Yes, it's even more frightening than I thought. Death is gross and dirty. It comes with a sack full of loathsome instruments. But how do you know all that, Princess? Death came so close, that I could see it all. But that's enough. Talk to me as if nothing happened. Joke, smile, tell me stories. I just don't want to think about what's going to happen. Who is that? Who?! Who is it? Who is it?! Do you hear it? - Do you hear? - Yes. I'm sorry, I was afraid of being late. Leave, everyone, except the Princess. How did you get here? I isolated you. Please leave now. Or I will want to kill you again. Only this time I will really do it. He will do it. Please leave now. Why are you crying? I'm crying of happiness. Now I have a secret, with which I wouldn't trust anyone, not even the closest friends, only you. I love you. I love you. That's the truth! I love you so much I will forgive you anything. You want to turn into a bear? Very well. Only don't leave me. I couldn't bare to be alone again! What took you so long? No-no, don't answer. I won't ask you. If you didn't come, that's because you couldn't. I will not reproach you. I will be patient. Only don't leave me. Today death came very close. That's true. But I am not afraid of it. I am so happy, I don't know anything about death and grief. Especially now, when you are standing so close. No one ever came this close to me. No one ever came this close to me, and no one ever held me tight. You are holding me, like you have the right to, and I like that. Let's go to my room. I'll show you the room, where I spent so many hours crying. The balcony from which I looked to see if you were coming, A hundred books about bears. Bears were all I could read about. It is all my fault. We can't do anything about that now. Yes, it is your fault. Why did you do that? I warned you, didn't I? It's the way I am. I wanted to talk to you about love. But I'm a magician. Remember, what you said? - Do you? - I remember. So I took all these people and reshuffled them. And they lived, so that you would laugh and cry. I am crying. Some of them worked better, some worse, but I've grown used to them. I couldn't cross them out, could I? They're not words - they're people. Sometimes I even let them argue with me, and disobey me. Sleep, darling. Unfortunately, I am immortal. I will have to outlive you, and forever miss you. But now you are with me. Glory to the brave ones, who have enough courage to love, knowing that everything has to end. Glory to the daring, who live as though they will live forever. - Why aren't you asleep? - Don't scare away the bear! - Let's go back. - No. - Let's go to your place. - I'm scared. You're hurting me. No, please, don't be offended. Let it be the way you want it. God, I'm so happy that I have decided everything! Foolish me! I didn't know it could be that good. let's do it your way. Well! I'm terribly sorry. I don't want to interfere in your work, but I think just now a miracle happened. Very well could be. Why are you surprised? What's going on?! I was promised, that he will turn into a bear. - You confirmed that. - I did. So where's the bear? I confirmed it, because I was not too clever. But I don't regret it now. I found your last story very amusing. At least it is good. Perhaps even the best. Let's say good-bye In a soft voice, Let's say good-bye In a low voice, Let's say good-bye With a light heart. A week or two, And we'll get over it, And everything will remain In the past. It is sad, It is senseless and Meaningless. Oh, how good it would be To start all over again. But it is impossible to Go back to where it started. Don't even dream about it. It was charming, It was fun, But it slipped away, and it Is not there any more.
