Sorry. That was my alarm clock. Yes, Tom. I've already been up for an hour and half finishing the article on the Icelandic resort. If you want me to complete that other article by noon, I need your notes. Good morning. Gary Hall's office. Good morning. This is Jackie Sinclair, confirming my nine a.m. interview with Mr. Hall. Oh. I was just about to call you. Mr. Hall has a flight at 10 a.m. Can we do 8:30 instead? No problem. See you then. Uh-oh. Make a note. Check with Don on final draft of Belize article. Make a note. Email about unpaid invoices. No, no! Keys, purse! This can't be happening! Hello! It's Jackie! Anyone home? Mr. Wiloughby! Mr. Wiloughby! Mr. Wiloughby! Morning, Ranger Davis! Hey, you leaving already? It's Dan, right? Hey. Good memory. Ah. No, no. We're just going to head up the trail. Set up camp. - Uh, which trail? - Upper loop. Ah. It's gorgeous. You'll gonna love it. Thanks. By the way, I'm glad you told us about keeping food in the bear box. Saw a whole family of raccoons sniffing around this morning. Yeah. They're persistent little buggers, but I like to tell people just make sure to pack out what you pack in. This is Rico. Adorable. How old is he? Not quite a year. Our neighbor's dog had a litter. You know actually, they have two more puppies that are looking for forever homes, if you're interested. Oh, I would love a dog but I work too many hours to take care of a dog. Maybe one day. Ah. Listen, there's a part of the upper loop... It's a little rocky, about two miles up. Just make sure you stay on the trail, okay? We will. Thanks. - Sure. - See ya. I Sean. - Hey, Daisy! - It's arrived! The Forest for Us Grant sent us a letter. Already? Yeah. The postal worker just dropped it off! Hurry back! I'm dying to know if we got the grant! Fingers crossed. - Here you go. - Okay. Hurry up and open it! I have to go relieve Byron at the kiosk. We'll never get the Nature Center remodeled without it. Okay, okay. What's it say? "Dear Mr. Sean Davis, Thank you for your application. "The Forest for Us grant is dedicated to providing "educational opportunities about wildlife conservation. "This year we. "Had many worthy applications. Unfortunately." We didn't get it. You spent so much time writing that grant. I get anything remodeling the Nature Center just isn't going to happen. Don't say that. Well, every grant I apply for, it's the same thing. They want to help the most people, and we just don't have enough visitors to the park. Why can't they see if we renovate the Nature Center, more people will come? What are you going to tell your mom? She's still coming out this week, right? Yeah. I was hoping to give her some good news for her birthday but I guess that's not in the cards. Hey. Look what I found. Wow. Where was this? In a box in the storage closet. That's your mom and dad, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Back when they were still dating. You see that stone my dad's holding there? It's called sphalerite. Really? Yeah. He had them use that exact stone to make my mom an engagement ring a year later. The purple ring she always wears? Yeah. This is really cool. I'm glad it could cheer you up after some not-so-great news. I'm gonna head over to registration. Relieve Byron. Sounds good. So after the police ran my license and saw that it actually was my house, they called a locksmith who showed up 55 minutes later and finally let me in. Why didn't you have 'em call me? I figured you were probably having breakfast with Uncle Keith like you always do when Mom's at one of her jewelry expos. Well, you can always call me, sweetie. At least you didn't break your own window. I still missed a really important meeting with CEO Gary Hall. Well, you know what I think. You are way overworked. Constantly running here and there, going from one hotel to the next. That's what you do when you're a freelance travel writer, Dad. I like it. You need to take some time for yourself. Relax. You might have a point. Here you go. Spaghetti carbonara with smoked pancetta. Exactly like I had at that hotel in Sardinia last month. Oh, you didn't have to go to all this work for me. I figured you might want something a little fancier than the spaghetti you've had every Wednesday night for the last 20 years. Well? It's good. It's real good. I don't know that I'd want it every week, but I'll take some more if you've got it. Your dad's right. You need a vacation. My entire job is one vacation after another. But it's still all work, all the time. I just think you'd feel a little more inspired if you got away for a while. Maybe. Well, I'm so glad you agree. Because I happen to have the perfect idea. Glamping! Oh, no. You know I don't do camping! I said glamping. Thank you. I heard what you said, Annette. There's nothing glamorous about camping. Well, then clearly you've never been in one of these. It's amazing! And we got an incredible deal. You bought that thing? No. I wish. Roger and I rented it for a week, hoping to get a little romantic getaway, but he got called away for work. So I guess you can come. Girls' trip? What about this place? That's why I have assistant managers, Jackie. It's called delegating. Your sister's having a baby soon. Do you think it's a good time to leave? Rebecca's not due for three more weeks. Oh. a girls' trip does sound like fun. I know. Let's go to New York City. We can stay at the Ritz-Carlton. It's in the heart of Manhattan, close to Times Square. We could see shows. No, thanks. I need someplace serene, where we can enjoy the peace and the quiet of nature. Las Vegas? Okay, I'll try it. But this RV better be as amazing as you say as it is. Yes! We're going glamping. We are going glamping. Oh, no. It's. huge. Wait until you see the inside! It's sweet. Okay, let's do this. Ah, there's just one itty-bitty problem. Oh, no. What? Well, you know, I'm used to driving my little Fiat and I almost hit three cars on the way over here. So can you drive? Give me the keys! You owe me big time, Annette! Okay, first letter is, uh, S. S? Swimming. You were a competitive swimmer in high school. Good job. I can't believe you remember that. Um, T. Tulips. They're your favorite flower. Okay, you're right. But I seriously don't remember telling you that. You mentioned it when Adam bought you flowers. He got you pink tulips. That was like six years ago. And I think it was the last time a man bought me flowers. They tend to do that kind of thing when you're in a relationship. You know, you actually have to go out in order to meet people. I would love to have someone in my life but it's so hard when I'm constantly traveling. I just. I haven't had the time. Does Roger still get you flowers? Once a month. Really? After being married for four years. Aww. I love that. Ah, slow down. I think it's coming up. Afternoon! Welcome! Hi, we're here for the week. Great. Camping registration is 20 dollars a night. If you will fill out this guest form, I'll give you a map to your spot, plus where the restrooms and trails are located. 0Oh, we won't be needing that. These bathrooms are nice. Oh, I know. Full kitchen, too. There you go. Now just make sure to put this in your window. - Thank you. - Enjoy. I don't understand this map. I mean, which one is it? Which number did you say it was? Space number 19. Maybe. oh, I think it's this one. Stop. Hey, you have to back it in. Hey, you have to back into it. What is he saying? He's saying it goes in backwards. Why in the world...? Okay. Stop! Stop, stop, stop. Oh, no! Are you okay? Oh. Are you okay? Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. It's okay, I'm fine. First time driving a motor home? What gave it away? Just a good guess. So your hookups are on this side. So you're gonna want to back it in and then make sure it's level once it's parked. That is, once I am at a safe distance. Thanks. We're new to glamping. Glamping? Glamping. Glamour camping. Well, I'm Sean, one of the rangers here. I'm Annette. Jackie. If you have any questions, you can find me at the ranger station which is, uh, right here on your map. Please don't leave any trash lying around and if you decide to have a campfire, keep the area around it clear and make sure it's not windy. We don't want any flying sparks. Sure. Common sense. Okay. Thanks, Sean. Speaking of sparks flying, that ranger's pretty cute. I am not here for that. I am here to relax, remember? Mm-hm. I guess I should turn the RV around. He said to level it, but it looks pretty level already. Looks good to me, too. Okay, cool. Let's get settled. All right. No more work today. Okay. Okay. Some chardonnay, mademoiselle. Mm. Here we go. I gotta admit, this was a good idea, Annette. Yep. Might be exactly what I needed. I was thinking, after dinner, we could go down and check out the lake because the map says that you can rent paddle boats. That'd be fun, right? I don't think the fridge is working. It's not on at all. Do you think that ranger might know how to fix it? Well, it's worth a shot. Otherwise all our food is gonna go bad. You should go see if he's still in the office. Yeah. You're not level. What do you mean? What does that have to do with the fridge? When you're tilted, all the refrigerant fluid moves to one side. So, your pump is starved. If you remember, I did remind you to make sure it was level. We remembered. We just didn't think it was that big of a deal. Only if you want your food to stay cold. It's nice to have a motor home probably levels itself with a button. But if not, you can buy one from the market. They close in about 10 minutes though, so you better hurry up. I tell you what, I can call 'em. Have 'em make sure they stay open for you. It's fine. We'll figure it out. Okay. You ladies have a good night. Looks like it's gonna be pretty cold tonight. I bet if we just bring all the food underneath the camper, it'll be good for the night. We'll go to the market tomorrow. Yeah, okay. There you are. It's late. Hey. Well, since you're in the mode of fixing things, the water won't shut completely off in one of the showers in the south men's bathroom. Okay. Be there in a minute. Okay. Sorry, Mom. I really am trying. Well, I'd say that was a successful first night. I'll second that. What was that? Hey, did you hear that? Is someone out there? What do we do? Stay right where we are. Turn on the light. It's just a raccoon. It is gorgeous outside. I love how. No. What is it? The food. It's all gone. What could have. The raccoons. I'm in the middle of nowhere, but I will still be checking messages. So please let me know if the file I sent will work for the October edition. Thanks. And the Jack-in-the-pulpits are in bloom this season right now as well. You guys should really check out the Nature Center before your hike. There's some pamphlets that describe the native flowers, and that opens at noon. Someone mentioned that place and they said there wasn't much to see. Well, we are workin' on fixing it up and it is gonna be great once we're done. And there's still some information you guys can pick up there, though. Okay, thanks for the tip. Sure. Hey Dad, can we get one of these? Good mornin'. I saw you guys had a little mess outside your motor home earlier. Nothing we can't clean up. Well, you'll want one of these. Great. Thanks. Have a good one! This is cool. Mr. Comedian. Yes. Twenty dollars a night. Thanks. Morning. You have any luck looking at that grant list again last night? No, nothing new. But I have a question for you. This rock formation. Does that look like it's near the waterfall? Hard to say for sure. But it looks like the ones up there. Why? For my mom's birthday, I was thinking about getting a necklace made that matches the stone from her ring. That's a great idea. She'll love that. You know your mom won't blame you for the Nature Center, right? She had a tough time getting grants too. I know. So hiking all the way up to the falls to find this stone has nothing to do with you feeling like you're disappointing her? It's about finding her something thoughtful for her birthday. And if you can manage here, I'm gonna hike up early tomorrow morning. Not tomorrow. The Junior Rangers will be here. Right. Yeah, okay, cool. Thursday then. Thursday. Oh, and the soap dispenser stopped working in the women's bathroom again. Oh. Sounds like a Daisy job. You wish. Yeah, I'll do it. ♪ I see it all, I see it now ♪ ♪ I got the eye of the tiger A fighter ♪ Bringing a drink would have been a good idea. You are not going to like this. Uh-oh. What now? There's no hot water, and the RV won't crank. Are you serious? Ranger Daisy thinks that it's the starter, so I called the owner but he's out of town and can't get anyone here for a few days. I bet that's part of why I got such a good price on it. A few days? That's crazy. What are we supposed to do? I need to shower. There's always the public one. Just don't forget your quarters. Quarters? All right. So how does this thing work? Hello. Anybody in there? What? Oh, no. That wasn't even five minutes! Ugh. Where's the handle? This is ridiculous. Oh, good. Someone else is in here. Ah. Hi, can I borrow a quarter? The stupid shower stopped on me and I got soap in my eyes. Here you go. What are you doing in here? I'm handing out quarters to unprepared glampers. Well, a decent guy would knock before entering the women's restroom. I did and I called out. No one answered. What are you doing in here? I'm fixing the soap dispenser. Well, this place could use some upgrades. Why don't you make me a list? I will get right on it. Maybe I will! - You use... - Oh. I'll get it for you. Thank you. Where's Byron right now? Ah, I think he's going and scoping out the meadow for the wedding. Hi, again! Wow, your hair looks so clean. Here you go. What is this? The list you asked for of everything that's been overlooked and needs fixing. I was kidding about that. But you know what? Let's have a look. Well, that whole facility could use some upgrades. But let's start with the soap dispensers. I was fixing those when I ran into you, remember? Done. And slip mats near the sinks would make the place much more functional. And how about an app to accept payment in the showers? An app? Really? Hm. Yes. It can connect directly to one of those things people use now, called credit cards. And how about individual soap dispensers in the stalls? Oh Daisy, make a note of that one. Individual soap dispensers. Let's try to find the kind they have at the Four Seasons. I can assure you from personal experience, they don't have those there. Then why would we want them? So you can fill them with organic plant-based soap. That way people will use that instead of bringing in who knows what and contaminating the grass. Also, when I was jogging, I noticed some puddles of standing water. All that's going to do is attract mosquitoes. We'll make sure to take all of this in consideration. Thank you. Please text me when things are working properly. And next time, maybe call out a little louder. I think she might like you. Oh yeah. She's my biggest fan. She's a travel writer. Let's look her up! Wow. Look, some of her articles have over a million views. Sean, this could be what we've been waiting for. What do you mean? If we can get her to write an article touting how great the park is, more people will visit, and then maybe we could get a grant. You just saw her. You think that woman is going to write us a glowing review? No way! Give me some of that chocolate. Oh yeah. What's a s'mores without some chocolate? Ah, yes. Evening, ladies! Hey, there! Ah. Please make sure the campfire is completely out before you head back to your glamour camper. Remember if it is too hot to touch, it's too hot to leave it. You're just full of helpful suggestions, aren't you? We will make sure to put the fire out properly. Do you want to stay and have some s'mores? No, thanks. I gotta make the rest of my rounds. You two have a good night. Oh, we have some extra marshmallows if you change your mind! Bye. Well. There's some crackly chemistry between you two. I think all this fresh air is making you completely delusional. No. Hey. Hi. What's going on? I have to go. Wait, what? Go where? Rebecca's husband just texted me. She's in labor. I need to get to the hospital. But the baby's not due for three more weeks. Tell the baby that, right? Um, I hate to ask you this. But. Oh, no. What? .I need you to stay with the RV until the owner can come fix it. You want to leave me! Here? All of this was your suggestion! I know. You'll be fine, though. You'll be fine. Bye! Hey. Are you alone now? Looks that way. At least for the next few days. Annette's sister went into labor, so I have to stay with the RV until it can get fixed. Well, there are worst places to be stuck. Says you. Maybe if you relaxed, you might enjoy the experience a bit more. Thanks. I'll keep that in mind. You know, this... this is a really great place to vacation. I'm happy to take you to the Nature Center if you want. I can show you some of the highlights of the park. Thanks. I think I'm just gonna go get some work done. Okay. Ah, do you know where I can get some decent Wi-Fi around here? Well, we do have it at the Nature Center. I always keep an extra one on me. And would you look at that. Nature Center's already circled. Thank you. Appreciate it. This map doesn't make any sense. All right, Junior Rangers. Here we have some examples of local plants found around the park. Now, we all know pine cones, right? They actually have these scales that open up. Each one holds two seeds. So a pinecone like this could hold the potential for 50 trees. If you've ever wondered where bread comes from, look no further than our old friend Mr. Rye here. This also grows locally at the park. And by the looks of it, you wouldn't think it would taste as good as it does, huh. Over here, we have some information about the local snakes, including the venomous copperhead. Now, you're gonna want to watch out for those guys while you walk around. But generally, if you stay out of their way, they will stay out of yours. I often get asked about the myth if baby snakes are more venomous than adults, but they're actually not. That's not true. Hah. I could have sworn I heard that the young ones can be more deadly. Ah. Pretty sure that's an old wives' tale. Well, I'm not an expert, but. But? I'm pretty sure I'm right on this one. And I'm pretty sure with my master's in biology and years' experience working in the park, I know what I'm talking about. Okay, but do you know everything? I never said I know everything. Well, I was watching a nature show. A nature show? Really? Yes. I've been known to watch educational programming at times. I didn't know they get those at the Four Seasons. All I'm saying is... And all I'm saying is... Actually, the babies aren't more venomous, but sometimes their jaw muscles aren't well developed, so they release more venom at times. - So I was right. - So I was right. Basically, yeah, you're both right. Thank you, Holden. Maybe would you want to stick around for the rest of the presentation? You might have some more information for us. I'd love to. Great. All right. Moving on, some of the fish found around the park can be found right here. One for you. For you. And you. All right, guys. Now remember, the first person who completes the scavenger hunt will receive a prize that is very useful at tonight's campfire. All right, everybody ready? Go! Yeah. Yay. Let's go. C'mon, c'mon, let's go, you guys. Hope it's more useful than the map you gave me. Umm. I gotta admit you're pretty good with the kids. Thank you. They're actually my favorite part of the job. I hope they'll continue to be good stewards of the land of the next generation. So? This is it. What do you think? It's rustic. Yeah. Could use a little bit of work. We've been trying to do renovations but the money's been a little bit tight. We're trying to apply for grants, but so far. Hasn't worked out. Well, when it does, you should incorporate some interactive electronic displays. Might help bring the place current. I don't know. I really like the idea of this place not being dependent on tech. Give people a chance to unplug. Spend time with your friends and family, you know? Yeah, but just keeping and remodeling what's here isn't gonna cut it. You've got a lot of competition when it comes to places for families to vacation. Maybe. But I'm optimistic. I think what we really need to do is just get the word out about what makes this place special. Like, our waterfall is amazing. I didn't see that on the map. Well that's a full day's hike from here so that's.here. Oh, check out the pics, though. Yeah, they don't really do it justice but. look at that. It looks pretty amazing. You know, I am hiking up there tomorrow. You're welcome to join if you want. Might be nice. You know, getting to see that in person. Ranger Davis. Can you come here? Ah. Be right there. Excuse me. Ah. What's up? Hey, Jackie. Okay, everybody eat your dinner before it gets cold. You play guitar, too? A man of many talents. Oh, my deah, I am but a humble beginner. I know a couple songs though. Okay, so who wants to hear a good ghost story? - Me. - Okay. And by good, I mean I'm gonna scare the pants off ya! Okay. Have I told you about the ghost in the cabin? No, no. - It was dark... - I can't remember. The last time I saw a group of kids that weren't on their phones. That's what I love about this place. It takes you back to a simpler time. If the offer is still good, maybe I will let you take me to the waterfall. A break might be a good idea. It might energize me. - One night. - Really? Well, that's awesome. You don't even have to plan a thing. I will take care of all of it. Ah, it is a full day, just so you know. Full day? You. don't worry. You're gonna be glad you did it. I promise. Maybe we could leave around eight? Okay, you got a deal. ♪ I used to bite my tongue And hold my breath ♪ ♪ Scared to rock the boat And make a mess ♪ ♪ So I sat quietly Agreed politely ♪ ♪ I guess that I forgot... Morning! Hey there! Is that backpack for me? Yep. Sean told me he was taking you on a hike up to the waterfall. So I figured I'd let you borrow mine. That's so nice of you. Although the more I think about going that far away, the more I wonder if I'm making the right decision. Oh, with Sean? You have nothing to worry about with him. You're in good hands. No. It's... it's not Sean I'm worried about; it's more animals.insects. No doctor's office for miles and miles. Morning. You two have fun! Thanks again. So on a scale of one to ten, how excited are you for this hike? And why is it a ten? All right, I got everything we need right here. Food, first aid supplies, and the one thing everyone always forgets: sunscreen. Okay. Ah, just give me a couple minutes to change and I'll be ready. Sure. So, this is what park rangers do for fun when they're not playing guitar or fixing soap dispensers. Oh, I would do this every day if I could. But this trip has a purpose. We are looking for a sphalerite. Please tell me that's not a type of spider. Oh, no, no. It's a kind of mineral that sparkles more than a diamond. - Really? - Mm-hm. I'm surprised I've never heard of it. Well, it's not usually turned into jewelry because it's so soft. But my father found it 41 years ago right in this park and had it turned into an engagement ring for my mom. Ah. Talk about romantic. What color is it? Well, it comes in lots of different colors. But here. I'll just show you. Right there. Oh, it's gorgeous. Right? Your parents, were they park rangers too? My mom was before she retired. She actually had the Nature Center built. She really wanted people to understand the importance of respecting, preserving nature. How fragile it all is. I can see why you want to renovate it so badly. And your dad, is he retired, too? He passed away a few years ago. That's why it's so nice Daisy found this photo of him. I'm sorry. Thanks. He was a really good guy. And I was lucky to have him for a father. How did they meet? Right here at this park. Both loved nature. Dad was a biology student at the university and he was studying the migration patterns of black bears. So there's. bears? No, no, no. Don't worry. We're not gonna see any where we're going. So what about you and your family? Well, kind of like you, I grew up with some pretty great parents. They encouraged me to follow my dreams, told me I could do anything I wanted in life. Do you see them a lot? Oh, yeah. Quite a bit. They still insist on picking me up from the airport, even though my company reimburses me for a cab. Aw. They must miss you a lot. I think it's more about saving money. They're pretty frugal. My dad still drives the same silver pickup he's had for the last 20 years. But I bet it's in mint condition. Actually, it is. Here. Let me take some of the weight off you. Uh, give me your food cans. Are you sure? You're already carrying quite a bit. Oh. I've carried a lot more gear than this before. So, uh. Well, we should get going. There's a spot up ahead where we can have lunch we can stop at. It's actually one of my favorite places along the hike. Sounds like a great plan. Excuse me. Is this poison ivy? Mrs. Davis! Hey. Hi. I didn't know you were coming until Saturday! I figured I'd come a few days early and surprise Sean. Where's my handsome son anyway? He's, um, he's on the upper loop. Oh, all the way out there. What for? Oh, you know, just wanted to take one of the campers hiking is all. So, he's gone all day? Yeah. But I was just about to head up to the market for lunch. You want to join me? I'd love to. So how'd you get into the whole travel writing thing? Must be fun staying at luxury hotels in Dubai. Paris. Someone looked at my articles, I see. Someone did leave her card with me. True. I did. Well, after studying journalism in college, I took an internship at a travel magazine. And that's how it all got started. It was so different from what I was used to. As a kid, whenever we traveled, we never stayed at hotels. My parents have friends in every state, so we always just stayed at someone's house. Was that to save money? You said your parents were frugal. That was part of the reason. But also, they just. they never want to do anything new. Even when I offer to take them to a fancy restaurant and really splurge, they don't want to go. They'd rather just eat at the same little old steak house they go to every Sunday night. Sometimes those places have great food. It's okay. Not amazing. But I knew at a young age that I needed a bit more variety. And I always wondered what it would be like to stay at one of those big, swanky five-star hotels. Look at you. Now you know. Yep. I'm sure camping was a big shock to your system then. And no wonder you loved our shower so much. It was a bit of a stretch. But I gotta admit it's growing on me. Oh, look. I think that bird wants a bit of our lunch. I saw another one of those birds on my run earlier. That's actually a northern cardinal. Ah. Oh, no. Don't feed him that. I have some bird seed. So did you know, unlike most northern songbirds, both the males and the females sing. I had no idea. Each mated pair will come up with their own specific song. They sing just for each other. They also mate for life. You're pretty romantic for a little bird. Yeah. That's why they're my favorite. So what now? You want to head down to the Equestrian Center? I hate to keep you from your work. Oh, you're not. I need to empty the bins down there anyway. Would you mind if we stopped the Nature Center on the way? Sean sent me his renovation plan a few months ago and I'd... I'd love to see what he's done with the place. Um, yeah. Sure. - Ranger Sean? - Dan? What's wrong? Where's your wife? She's okay. We're all okay, but I could really use your help back at the campsite. Let's go. Right this way. We were playing fetch with Rico's toy and I threw it too far. It went down here. I know it seems silly, but it's his favorite. This way. You see? It looks pretty far in there. Yeah, I tried to hook with it a stick, but I couldn't find anything long enough. Don't worry. We'll get it out. I'm always prepared for these types of situations. Okay. Constrictor knot should do it. It's too short. I bet if we move this top rock out of the way, the rope would be long enough to reach. All right. - Ready? On three. - Yeah. One, two, three! Okay. It's not gonna work. What if we use some sort of lever to move the rock? Let me guess. You saw that on an educational program. Sixth-grade science class. Work equals force times distance, right? Yes, it does. All right. We just need a heavy stick then. All right. Uh. Hey, how about this one? - Yeah, perfect. - All right. All right. You ready? Yep. - On three. - Right. Okay. One, two, three! Success. Success. I guess I was wrong. We did encounter a bear on this trip. All right, thanks. Oh, my gosh. You got it out. Rico, they found your bear. These two did. Oh, what a good boy. Hello. Hey, your puppy is adorable. Can I take his photo? Oh, yeah. Of course. Stay right there, buddy. Stay right there. Have a seat. - Oh. - Oh, good boy. Oh. Thank you. Hey, not to rush off but we should get going if we want to find that sphalerite. Mm-hm. Thank you so much for your help. Of course. Bye-bye, Rico. See you. Bye. So this faslerite we're looking for. Sphalerite. Yeah, that. Are you planning on turning it into a ring for someone special? Like your dad did for your mom? I'm actually having made it into a necklace. But yes, it is for someone I love very much. What's her name? Evelyn. How long have you and Evelyn known each other? A long time. About 36 years. It's for my mom. Her 60th is coming up. And for a birthday gift, I thought I would find the same mineral from the same stone and have a matching necklace made. Well, that pretty much makes you the most amazing son on the planet. I know. But to answer your question. No, there's no one special in my life right now. How about you? It's hard when I'm constantly traveling for work. Really? Why is that hard? It's difficult to remain close to someone when you're gone three weeks out of a month. You don't think so? I don't know. I think if you love someone, you love them. Whether you're 5,000 miles away or sitting right next to them, right? I suppose, but no one wants to spend more time missing someone than actually being with them. Yeah, but that's focusing on the negative. It's emphasizing what you don't have instead of what you do. Why not focus on just making the most of the week you do have together? And that way when you're apart, you have something to look forward to. I can't argue with that. You hear that? Is that waterfall? We're right there. Wow. You weren't kidding. Pretty amazing, right? I have to admit, I was a little skeptical when we first started out, but you didn't exaggerate. Hmm. Alright, so we're looking for the rock formation here behind my dad. I don't see anything like that. Yeah. Me either. But my mom said they found it on their hike up here, so It's got to be here somewhere. Okay. Can we go in? Let's see. I guess I was wrong. It's not here. I'm sorry. I just. I know she's going to be disappointed, is all. Did she know you were coming up here to find it? No, no, no. Uh, what I really wanted to do was have the Nature Center renovated, surprise her with that. This was the next best thing. Well, since we're here. Why don't we take the weight off our legs for a little while. Are you sure? We can go back... -No, I want to. You came all the way out here. Should at least enjoy it, right? Sean's been trying really hard to get a grant. It just hasn't. worked out. Mm. When he came up with the plans to renovate, he was so excited. I know. It's not his fault. He's done a terrific job with the park. I couldn't have left it in better hands. You should tell him that. Mm. Mm. It's nice, huh? Not having to worry about the clock for a change. You know, this is the first time I think I've seen you actually relax. It suits you. You know, if more people knew about this, you'd have lots of visitors. I mean, we would love to get the word out. You're a travel writer; would you be up for maybe writing an article about it? This place is nothing less than spectacular, but. But? The magazines I write for wouldn't be interested in nature. They're all about five-star resorts, Michelin-rated restaurants, private yacht rentals. I understand. I wish I could help. I know. It's just. I don't know, we're trying so hard to get the word out about this place. There's one more grant application I'm thinking of applying for. What? I'm mean, I'm not sure if we qualify. It's called the Lincoln grant. It's given to non-profits that focus on nature education. Which you do, right? Yes, but not well. Ah. At least not when it comes to having physical proof of it like an up-to-date Nature Center. But I'm not one to give up. Where there's a will, there's a way. Exactly. I was able to convert you, wasn't I? Me? Definitely. This has been. Better than expected. In a lot of ways. What is that? It's a snail. Ugh. Sometimes they get lucky and the birds drop them. There you go. Let's take a selfie. I want to prove to Annette her plan to get me to focus to actually worked. Wow. You're really photogenic. Thanks. Let's see the photo you took of little Rico. Oh, he's so cute. If I were to get a dog I'd want. Sean, look. Yeah, he's adorable. No, no, no. That's not. That's not what... Ah, where's the photo of your dad? Um. - Do you see it? - Oh, my gosh. That's it. That's the rock formation. We were right there. That's it. We found it. We found it. I couldn't have done it without you. Stand in front of it. Let me take your picture. Okay. Okay. Come on. What a day, huh? What a day. I should probably get this to the jeweler in town before he closes up for the night. She'll be here Saturday. She's going to love that. You'll have to tell her the story of how we found it. Oh, definitely. I will be telling this story for a long time. Will I see you tomorrow? I'll come by. Good. Well, I'll let you get settled in for the night. See you tomorrow. Yeah. Mom? What are you doing here? - Surprise! - Hi! I decided to come a couple days early. Oh. Figured I'd make you homemade lasagna. Cool. Now sit down. You must be starved after such a long day. Daisy said you hiked the upper loop. Yeah. I took a camper up there to see the waterfall. She said she'd never seen it before. She? It's not like that, Mom. She is a travel writer. She spends all her time traveling and or writing. Oh. Never heard you mention taking anyone with you on that hike before. Her friend she was camping with had to go home. And she was bored. And I invited her, and she went and that's it. So, are you excited for your birthday? Sixty is the new 40. That's what Daisy said today. I don't know if I believe her, but I'll take it. So you saw Daisy, huh? Yeah. She drove me around the park. We had lunch together and went down to the lake. Did she show you the Nature Center? Hmm. Pretty disappointing, right? Sorry. For what? When you retired, I promised you that I would turn it into what you always dreamed it would be. I haven't. Not yet. I-I appreciate that you're so positive, but I am being realistic. I have applied to every grant except for one and it's virtually impossible to get and they have all turned me down. I think it's okay to admit it at this point. I failed. The only way to fail is to stop trying. Okay. The deadline is. That's one week from now. I may not be able to write an article for you, Sean, but I can write one heck of a grant essay. Hey there, Auntie. Mom and the cutest little baby boy are doing just great. That's wonderful! But I'm here alone at the restaurant missing my weekly dinner date. You didn't get enough of me here in the wilderness? I was worried about leaving you, but you look like you're still alive. So did you happen to see that cute ranger after I left? I actually did. And? I'll tell you about it later. Right now there's something important I have to get back to. Don't tell me you're working. It's not for me, actually. I'll explain everything at our dinner next week. You better! I promise. Bye. Bye. "Wildflowers and cardinals and even bears "aren't just a list of things you might see if you go camping. "They're part of something bigger: "an ecosystem in which everything "must remain in balance. "This is one of the many life lessons I learned "from Park Ranger Sean Davis "as he took me on my first real hike "through the beautiful, unpredictable, "and sometimes even dangerous terrain. "Just as a geologist needs a rock pick "to carve out a precious stone, "a ranger as adept and passionate as Ranger Davis "can't accomplish his job without proper tools. "A new Nature Center would give campers of all ages "a first look into the wonders of what the park has to offer. "Where they could learn in a way "that involves seeing, feeling and touching instead of words and photos on a computer screen." You all settled, Mom? You need anything? I'll take a glass of chocolate milk and two graham crackers. Do you remember asking me for that every single night when you were little? I guess I forgot about that. Funny how things change, huh? Yeah. At night, I'd see if you need anything and next morning, I'd be the one getting ready to go into work at the station. Now it's you. Mom, if I had to follow in someone's footsteps. Yours seemed like a pretty good fit. Oh. Good night, Mom. Good night, sweetie. "This grant would offer the same experience "to even more people, "and hopefully change their perspectives as well. "With this grant funding, "Ranger Davis and the rest of the park staff "would have the ability "to not only reimagine the park's Nature Center "into one designed to educate people in the 21st century, "but the power to teach others to also be important stewards "of our one and only home, Planet Earth. "Please consider offering this year's Lincoln Grant to Willford State Park." I hope this does it, Sean. You deserve to see your vision come true. Just a minute! Are you kidding me? Ah. Good morning. Havin' a problem with your RV? It's not even 6:30. Can you come back later? Yeah. Yeah. How about a week from Tuesday? No, no, no, no, that's, that's okay. I need to get this fixed. Okay. I-see, how this works is, I need to come in there and turn her over, see what she's doing. I can't, uh, I can't do it from here, so. Okay. Okay. Give me five minutes. Five... five minutes. Okay.. All right. I'll just. I'll just be here then. Revisiting all my fantastic life choices. It's all yours. I'm heading to the market. I'll be back soon. That was longer than five minutes. Real charmer, that one. I gave your repairman directions to your RV. It'll be nice to get that fixed so you can head home. So how was the waterfall? It was incredible. I am so glad I went. Oh, here. Thanks. Ah. Did he tell you we found that flaspherite he was looking for? The sphalerite? No way. That's terrific. By the way, do you know what time Sean comes in today? Oh, yeah. His mom came in early. So he texted me this morning and said he was gonna hang out with her till noon. Why? There's just something I want to show him. Actually, do you have a printer in your office I could use? Sure. As long as you're not printing out War and Peace. Budget doesn't cover that. No, it's just a couple of pages. I promise. Ah, there's something I want to give him a copy of when he gets in. Go for it. I have to check in with some visitors this morning. But any time after 10, you can go on in and help yourself. Perfect. Gives me time to shower. Oh, and remember to plug the key code into the lock. What's the key code? 1-2-3-4. Okay, that looks a lot better. Thank you for the vase. Are you gonna write a little note to go with it? Should I? I mean, I'm gonna hand them to her. I assume she'll know they're from me. Yeah, but the note is something she can keep after the flowers die. Good point. Hm-mm. And what about the travel article? Ah. There isn't gonna be one. You mean you weren't able to convince her to write one for us? Even after she saw the waterfall? Unfortunately, no. She wanted to, but none of the magazines she writes for would publish something like that. Bummer. Yeah. But the whole trip turned into so much more than that. Because I found myself wanting to show her all these little cool things about hiking and nature and camping. I found myself wanting to spend time with her. That's what you should write in the note. Excuse me, sir. The RV that was right here. Did you see it leave? Yeah, sorry boss. She left about 10 minutes ago. You just missed her. She looked like she couldn't wait to get out of here, either. I thought she had ants in her pants. Good Lands, what happened to you? She already left. I guess she didn't feel like saying goodbye. Uh. Home sweet home. Back to real life. Just... just please. Give me a call. Uh, hi, Jackie. It's Sean. Look. I don't know why you left this morning without telling me goodbye, but I found the essay you wrote for the Lincoln grant for us. The things that you said about the park, about me. Uh, just... just please, give me a call. Sure, I'll call you back. I love being used. This is delicious, Mrs. Davis. You're gonna have to give me the recipe. The secret's in the sauce. See, I... I just. I... I don't know what I did wrong. How could she write all those wonderful things in the grant application and then just disappear like that? Honey, have you. Thought about going to see her in person? I can't do that. Why not? Fortune favors the bold. The bold, Sean! Well, I don't know where she lives, Mom. Her address is in the registry. Come on, Rob. You promised me the piece on the Tahitian resort. That one's been mine since it was announced. I'll have that draft for you this afternoon. Can you send me the contact info for the Vancouver hotel? And. Rob, we'll talk soon. Okay? Can we talk? Please. What are you doing here? This, Jackie. How could you write these words and not even say goodbye? I thought that. You thought what? I don't know. Maybe it was just me, but I thought we had a connection. Go ahead and use what I wrote. That's what you wanted, right? All the charm, all the time you spent with me, you just wanted to use me for publicity. That's not true! I enjoyed the time we spent together. A lot. So, you weren't hoping that by taking me up to the waterfall that I'd write an article on it? No. That was Daisy's idea and I thought it was a terrible one. I invited you on that hike because I wanted to show you something, to share something with you that I thought might make you like the park more. But it quickly became about something else. Jackie, it became about being with you. Laughing, having fun, getting to know each other. I haven't opened myself up like that in a very long time. This doesn't mean anything to me. You do. I don't know what you hoped to gain by coming here, Sean. But I'm sorry, I. I have a lot of work to do. I need to get back to it. Can you throw this away for me, then? I don't wanna litter. Goodbye. Happy birthday. Thank you. Oh. While you open this, I'm gonna cut the cake. What did you get me? Just open it. Oh, sweetheart. Is this...? From the same stone Dad found your ring. I can't believe it. How'd you find it? Actually Jackie found it. We were helping this couple retrieve a dog toy and then Jackie took a picture of the dog and the dog looked at me and it's... It's a long story. Do you like it? I love it. Hey. Sorry I'm late. Oh. Oh, here you go, Mrs. Davis. Happy birthday. Oh, thank you, honey. Oh, you opened it. Isn't it incredible? Yes. What's this? Oh, I don't know. A messenger brought by earlier and asked me to sign for it. Oh, I love how it catches the light. It's from the Lincoln grant. I didn't know you applied for it. I didn't. "Dear Miss Sinclair. "Thank you for applying for the Lincoln grant. "Our mission is to expand the awareness "of nature's resources and increase education "about the importance of preserving our nation's parks. "We are pleased. "To inform you that we are awarding this year's grant to Willford State Park." Are you serious? I thought you ripped it up. She must've sent it in anyway. Oh my gosh, Sean! This is amazing! I can't believe she did this. I think this is a sure enough sign for you to drive back down there. She made it clear. She doesn't want to see me again. Well, maybe she changed her mind. Sean, do you know why I love this necklace so much? Because it reminds you of the one Dad gave you? Yes. But more importantly, when I look at this necklace or the ring, I remember the day we hiked up that trail, decided to rest in the shade of those rocks and saw this sphalerite shimmering in the sun. Your father and I felt we'd discovered a treasure we didn't even know we were looking for. I imagine that's how you and Jackie felt when you found it too. Now this memory belongs to me and your father, but this belongs to you and Jackie. Now, maybe it'll be just one of hundreds of fun little stories you'll tell at dinner parties or over a beer with a friend. Or maybe it'll be the story the two of you share for the rest of your lives, when someone asks about the moment you knew she was the one. Only you can make that decision, Sean. Which do you want it to be? She's got a point. Okay. I'll try. But I'm gonna need reinforcements. And then she said the baby waved his little hand like he was playing a violin or something. Apparently it was so cute. You're not listening, are you? I am. What did I just say? I'm listening. I know you, Jackie. It just sounds like a big miscommunication. I mean, do you really want to let something that could be so special just slip away? Sean? Remember that puppy that lost his bear? This is his brother. And you brought it here, why? Oh, uh, he's got a question for you. He does? Mm-hm. Oh. Okay. Okay. He wants to know if you and I can start over from the beginning. And if you'll accept my apology, because. Well, I think you're the most amazing woman I've met in a very long time. I would never use you to get to your writing skills. I kind of figured that out when you ripped the grant application into a million pieces. I know that you submitted us for that, and because of you, we got it. What?! That's wonderful news. So what's your new friend's name? Well, I was kind of hoping you could help me with that. You know, team effort. I might be able to come up with some suggestions. Oh. What was that? Okay, I'll ask. What does he want to know now? Well, soon-to-be-named puppy here was wondering if I could finally have a kiss from you. I can't think of anything I'd like more. Hi. You got a new friend. Aren't you gonna miss the way it was? Even a little? Oh, it served its purpose. I'm excited to see what the new improved version is going to look like. Hey, guys. They're here! Thank you. It means a lot to me. All I did was fill out an application. No, I didn't mean the grant. Oh, what were you thanking me for? For making my son so happy. Hey, guys. Hey. To new beginnings. Cheers! - Cheers. - Cheers. Well, here we go. Here we go.
