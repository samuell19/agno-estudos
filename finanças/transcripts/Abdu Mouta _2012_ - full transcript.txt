-What the hell? Where will I go? -Get dressed, quickly! I knew that I was jinxed tonight! -Abdo! -Hamasa? Man! You almost gave me a heart attack! -What do you want? -The police are here! -And they're looking for you! -What? I have the bag of weed with me! Damn! Come on! I swear I was going to give myself in, but I wanted to shower first. Have a great day, sir. THREE MONTHS LATER Happy Holidays, Rabiaa. Thank you. Is today a holiday? Yeah, I've decided that every day I spend here is a holiday. I'll give the boys an official day off, too. I just wish you'd change your mind, so we could make every day a holiday. Or do you still love that guy, Mota? Why are you bringing him up now? Haven't you done enough? Think he doesn't know you're the one who put him in jail? So what? I really feel bad for him. He's a young fool who thought he could stop a moving train. He wanted to defy me. You wanted him out of the way so you could have Angham to yourself. Come on, Rabiaa, do you want to ruin this day? No. Let's keep it as a day of celebration. That's much better. -How are you, old woman? -Hello. Abdo Mota is back, Om Abdo! Abdo Mota is back, everybody! My man! -Hello, Mota! -Let's dance, everyone!

What you said? What about my child, Abdo? I told you to get rid of it. An abortion only costs 3,500 pounds. -And I'll pay. -What if I die? -Don't worry. You'll be all right. -Fine. Come with me. Do you think it'll be a fun house? It's no place for men. God is my ally, and he'll make you pay. God will make you pay, Abdo Mota. God will make you pay. It's you! Is that how you wake me up? Good morning. Smooth like butter. -What? -Your beans are as smooth as butter. I hope you enjoyed it. One cup of tea coming! Do you truly mean that, girl? Put your hand away before I break it! I'm not a little girl! I'm not a little girl. Fine, you're a queen. Yes, I am, whether you like it or not. My God! How I wish to have a son. -Give me one pound. -Oh, my God! Get the hell out of here, boy! -Good morning, my queen. -That would be your mother. You and your sharp tongue! Why are you being mean like that? I'm not being mean! You just twist my words. Fine. I’m hungry, get me a plate of chili beans, quick. And why are you in such a hurry, Mota? You've been out of jail for six months and you haven't changed. I don't want to fight now, I'm about to eat! Why are you spitting poison this morning, like a viper? Where's your dad? He's getting ready. Mr. Nasef has a party tonight. -And when will we have our own party? -That's in God's hands. When you're an honest man. -I swear, you're a beauty queen. -Stop it. Do you know what I want? I want to marry you before I die. -Stop it! -Plus, I am an honest man now. I wash cars all night with soap and cold water. And I collect fares from bus drivers during the day. Fine, but you still have a sordid past. And you know your uncle, Radi. He doesn't like that at all. Fine, go talk to him, then. I knew this would be a shitty day! What's the matter with him? What are you doing, girl? Do you think you're Nancy Ajram? Stop this and help me! I'm tired from all the chores! -What's wrong, Mom? What did I do to you? -God will punish you! God will punish you! Get up girl! Get up and water the front lawn, you good-for-nothing! -Your brother, Abdo, is on his way! -I'm tired. I can't do anything. If someone hears you saying that my brother Abdo is on his way, they'll think that Abdo's some prominent doctor, bringing gifts! And stop saying that I'm good for nothing, or I swear I'll move out! And where would you go? To hell, if that would give you peace of mind! I'll only have peace of mind when you're married. Married? And how is that going to happen? How can I get a husband when your son keeps going back to jail? When a man comes to me to ask me to marry him, then as soon as he finds out that my brother is an ex-con, -he'll leave and never come back! -Don't say that about your brother! All that you have is because of him! What are you saying? Listen, Radi, my old man. I'll get straight to the point. -I want to marry Angham. -That can't happen, Mokhtar. -Why is that? -Frankly, we run in different circles. Yours is full of drugs and other obstacles. I can't let my daughter marry a drug lord. -But you'd let her marry an ex-con. -What do you mean by that? -Mota. -She won't marry Mota. I will only let my daughter marry someone who loves and takes care of her. I'll take good care of her, Radi. The best guy in this neighborhood is the carpenter. You’re so poor, a mouse couldn't find something to eat at your house. It'd kill itself. But people are so ambitious. Do you want her to marry Amr Hamzawi? Be reasonable, Radi. You need to rest. Stop cooking beans all night and working as a butler all day. Listen, Mokhtar. People with no money are poor. But those who have money and nothing else are even poorer. We're done talking, Radi. The tea is on me. Where's your husband, woman? Not again! -Where are you going, Shabah? -I can't pay you now, Abdo. -I'll pay next time. -I'd have said yes if you'd asked nicely. But because of your attitude, you must pay double, now. This is my first run, Abdo. I work nights. I haven't been working all day for charity! I can't believe this. Here you go. Drop dead. -You can go now, boy. -Listen Mota! Don't you dare boss me around! I'm the boss here, whether you like it or not! I'm not scared of you, boy! If you're scared, you should've stayed in your village! -I'm warning you, boy! -Abdo! -I'll show you, Abdo! -Go now, Abdo! -I'll show you, Abdo! -Go now man! If I see you here again, I'll kill you! -Calm down, Abdo. -Come on. Go, man. You're amazing. You're so beautiful. -By the way, where's your child's father? -You mean, who is his father. -Fine, who? -Some guy, God forgive him. He slept with me then ran away. So, I gave the kid my late father's name. Poor you. You're really leading Mokhtar El Aw on. -He adores you. -What are you talking about? He's rich and can buy a dozen men like your scrawny lover boy, Abdo Mota. What makes you bring up Abdo now? I'm just going to tell it to you straight. Everyone is talking about you. -Spreading rumors about you both. -I love him. So what? And by the way, I've hated Mokhtar since he ratted Abdo out to the police. Abdo had it coming. He disobeyed Mokhtar. Wake up and smell the roses. That boy loves his cousin, the daughter of Radi, the guy who sells beans. Angham, his cousin. Not Angham, the singer, honey! -Six pounds for one kilo of cucumbers! -Watermelons! ABU AHMAD FRUITS Sweet watermelons! Sweet watermelons! Sweet watermelons! Red tomatoes! They're fickle, just like women! I want one-and-a-half kilos. Try the sweet Egyptian cucumbers. Shall I add a kilo of those? No, I just want one-and-a-half kilos of tomatoes. -I'm telling you, they're really sweet. -Get a grip! What's wrong with you? Behave or I'll make your day as black as night! You're the one playing games here! You bastard! I'm playing games here? How dare you talk to me like that! I'll make your day as black as night! -Go, girl, or I'll teach you some manners! -What? You bastard! -Montasir! -I'll show you! -Go get Abdo! -Consider it done! -Is that your so-called protector? -No! This is my protector! -Don't make me hit you, woman! -Hit me? I'll show you! -Get your hands off me! -You get your hands off me! Stop what you're doing girl and behave! -He's insulting your sister! -Zip it, girl! -No. I'll show him! -Go home! -No, I want to teach him a lesson! -Go home! -Go home! -Fine, Abdo, you teach him a lesson! How dare you? Whoever crosses this line will die. What? Yeah! Thank you, men. -Hey, One-Eye! -What? -It's a police checkpoint. -Oh, God! Since when is there a checkpoint here? -It looks like a setup, man! -Oh, my God! Run, man! Fire at them! Stop the music! I salute this neighborhood, where strong men are born. I salute the boss, Mokhtar El Aw! A great man indeed. And we're all brothers. We're all brothers, even if some are better than others. I salute everyone in the neighborhood. If you want to be a leader, treat your people well. I want to dance. Oka Remix! You want to be unique But there are those who envy you I dare you, I'm here What do you want to do? I dare you, I'm here I've come to play with you I closed my door and was walking Past the neighbor's door A girl tried to jinx me by painting Voodoo symbols all over the walls I pretended I didn't see it I don't know what might happen to me I might get possessed I took a different path Trying to mind my own business I just want to get to work And make some money What do people want? What are they doing? What do people want? What are they doing? Some envy me, others hate me Tell me what to do Some envy me, others hate me Tell me what to do Oh, blessed mother Of Hassan and Hussein Protect us from the evil eye Protect us from the evil eye Oh, blessed mother Of Hassan And Hussein Protect us from the evil eye Some want to hurt me And some harbor grudges Some want to hurt me And some harbor grudges And there's someone watching My every move who doesn't wish me well And there's someone watching My every move who doesn't wish me well We've become some people's worst nightmare After they were big shots We've become some people's worst nightmare After they were big shots People are calling me Some crazy and some sane People are calling me Some crazy and some sane Some swear at me and make fun And some thank me a lot Some swear at me and make fun And some thank me a lot Oh, yeah Oh, yeah, they're crazy Everyone shows his true colors Protect me from those who envy me This is my story Yeah, Kanni. Did it all go well? Good. He's rich He has millions but he still wants more People never stop talking They're envious Nagging makes you want to run away And doesn't bring you closer Makes you want to run away And doesn't bring you closer They call me arrogant They gossip about me and say I'm arrogant They gossip about me He thinks he's a singer, a good one too He thinks he's a singer, a good one too I'm a simple guy God is my protector And if you depend on God You will never go astray Oh, yeah Oh, yeah, they're crazy How could you leave the drugs behind? You stupid mules. There was nothing else we could do, boss. We couldn't stay there. If we hadn't acted fast, we would've been captured, too. Honestly, boss, -there's something fishy going on here. -What do you mean? The police aren't that smart, but this is the second bust this month. Someone is ratting us out to the police, boss. Right, Saadawi, go get Yasser the Lefty. -Done, boss. -It seems, men, that they know everything about us. Put out that nasty cigarette. I couldn't eat all this without you. So, you like me now? Stuffed pigeon? I've only seen pigeons in the air. I'll like you even more when you're on the straight and narrow. I'm an honest man. Abdo, I want a man who would bring me the world and put it at my feet. And if he can't, I'll stand with him against the world. Here. That's why I want to be rich, so I can get you all you want. What do you think I'm putting myself in harm's way for? My mother? We're doing nothing until we're man and wife, Mota. Don't make me leave. Woman, wait! Stop being mean. I'm nothing without you, like a street without lights. Like a crossing without traffic lights. Like a cup of tea without a cigarette. -"Cigarette"? -That's poetry. -Give me a kiss. -Abdo, behave! Hello, Khaled. Come here. -Were you at the hospital today? -Yeah. -Who told you? -So, it's true, then. What about the baby you're carrying? -What are you talking about? -The reason you wear loose clothes. I was at the hospital today. I met a doctor who's a friend of mine, and he told me everything, you slut! You've brought shame to us! Who did this? You want to make a scandal? Have you no shame? -Who did this? Tell me! -I don't know! Bullshit! Tell me! -Abdo! -Abdo who? -Abdo Mota! -What? I don't force anyone to buy weed from me. I sell only to those who have the money. And if money is tight for them, I give them time to pay. Could I be any better? Plus, I don't buy or sell. Hamasa and Yasser do that. Everyone has their own specialty in our business. "Specialty"? And what's yours? -I ensure that things go smoothly. -"Smoothly"? Listen here, Mota. Don't play games with me! I've said my piece. If you want to marry me, then change your ways. If you don't want to marry me, stay as you are. Go home now. Join me. -I'll make you some tea. -I don't want tea or coffee! Don't raise your voice, please. You're a student, and your sister's reputation is yours, too. My advice is to never mention this again. So, you know why I'm here, then. -Your sister told me two days ago. -What about the child she's carrying? That's her problem, not mine. And what makes you so sure it's mine? If you got food poisoning, could you say exactly what food caused it? Or do you just want to blame me, regardless? Bastard! This isn't my problem. Tell your sister to stop spreading rumors about me! I could kill and bury you where you stand. I sent for you yesterday. Why didn't you come? I was busy with work, boss. As soon as I got home and saw Saadawi waiting for me, I came here. Who ratted Mokhtar El Aw out, Lefty? -I swear that I don't know, boss. -You do know. -Abdo Mota, right? -I just follow orders, boss. When we were at the wedding party, Abdo got an anonymous call. I heard him mention someone called Kanni, and then he seemed to become very happy. That phone call was about the bust, right? When Abdo ventured out on his own, I let him be, since we all have our own ambitions. What's wrong if Abdo dreams of a better future? What a shame. The devil played with his mind, and told him to move Mokhtar El Aw out of his way. Ambition! It seems that the virus of ambition has spread. -Do you listen to Feiruz, Kanni? -No boss, I swear. -Give me your phone -It's off, boss. That doesn't matter. What a miracle. It turned on. Nice. Look, Kanni. ABDO MOTA Forgive me, boss. I wish I could, son. Only God forgives. And we are only... human! God rest his soul. God rest his soul. I want two pounds' worth of beans. -Hot or sweet? -Your sweetness is enough. -I want chill beans, hun. -God, grant me patience. If it's patience you want, take half a sleeping pill. Those who visit you take sedatives, honey! You have no manners, girl! -I'm all out of manners, dear. -I can get you some, little girl. -What do you want, slut? -Are you stupid, girl? Does your mom know? -Your mother is the slut! -Stop talking about my mother! She's a decent woman, unlike your mother! You've always been a loose woman! People like you can't point fingers! What's wrong with people like me, you scum? You're rotten, just like the onions you use! I've been more than patient with you! Come here, girl! Drop dead! Are you crazy? Get out of here! Come here! Help! Help! What's wrong with you, woman? Stop it, girl! -Enough! -You slut! -I'll show you! -Calm down, Rabiaa. Do you hear what she's saying? I said enough, woman! -Come on. -Where are you taking me? -If someone sees us, it'll be a scandal! -I want to tell you something important. -What do you want? -I've missed you, girl. If you're playing with me, Lefty, I'll kill you. -No way. I love you. -Prove it. Everything is proof of my love to you. You, me, the stars, the sofa we're sitting on... If this sofa could speak, it'd tell you how much I love you. -When will you marry me? -Soon. -My word is binding. -No marriage certificate? I said soon. We'll talk later. How many weddings did we work yesterday? Not enough. The people of Alexandria need to step the weddings up. We can't sell just small amounts anymore. I'd love not to, but we need the money. I have it. Just tell people they need to double their orders. Double their orders, okay. Now, tell me, how's life treating you? -Angham is killing me, Hamasa. -Why, man? What does she want? She wants me to sell bread. Yeah. Everyone would make fun of me It'd be a nice cover for the police. -And what did he say? -Nothing. Since I suggested he sell bread, he hasn't spoken to me. -He's ignoring me. -Try to convince him, but be kind. I've tried that many times before. I can't be patient anymore. Do you want me to wait until the police drag him out of our marital bed? What if he went to jail and died there, like your dad? I'd mourn him for the rest of my life. Where's Om Abdo? -Come and listen to this, Auntie! -I don't know what to tell you, dear. -Abdo has a kind heart. -No-one is contesting that But you need to convince him to sell bread. -What's that noise outside? -I don't know. Oh, my God! -Hello. -Help us, dad! What do you want? What do you want from us at this hour, Mokhtar? It's none of your business. Stay out of this. I have a debt to settle with that dog, Abdo. -Abdo is no dog, you coward! -Give me that! This is very wrong, Mokhtar! What's the matter with you? I told you to stay out of it! No! Let Alia go and hit me instead. -Stay away, retard! -Let go! -Mokhtar! -Leave the girl alone! -I'm telling you to leave the girl alone! -Enough! Enough, Dragon. Listen. Tell your beloved son that this time, I only knocked down his garage. Next time, I'll burn it down. Pray that he's not inside when this happens. Take care. "Take care"? He's unbelievable! I'm worried this time. What did you do with Abdo? Abdo met me on the way here, with Hoksha. He took my car with the money and left. Why is he so late? -What is that? -What is that? Abdo, what took you so long? The police were everywhere. -Were you followed? -Come on, not me. Mota can handle things. I jumped from one roof to another until I got here. Get the weed out, Lefty. Hamasa! Go open the door. It's my sister, Alia. -Hamasa! -Coming. -Is Abdo here? -Yeah, inside. What's wrong, girl? Aw and his men broke into our house and beat us. He says that he tore down your garage. God be with us. God be with us and help us. Why are you still up, honey? -It's nothing, Dad. -Nothing? I know you well. What's wrong? I'm tired, Dad. I'm tired. Tired? Of what, honey? Abdo, Dad. He's not good enough for you. He's not a good fit for you. He's a criminal, just like his dad. The only thing keeping us from never speaking to him again... is your aunt, Wafiya. -But I love him, Dad. -But he doesn't love you. If he loved you, he would sacrifice for you, but Abdo sacrifices nothing for no-one. Abdo's path is very different from ours. Believe me. I'm your father. May God help us. May God help us. Haven't I told you a million times to come to me when you need something? I couldn't help it, boss. My wife went into labor and had to go to the hospital. That's why I took out a loan. Mokhtar El Aw's men never ask for money, you fool. Do I have to keep teaching you how to act like men? What do you have to say, Mr. Big Shot, about someone who attacks the women of a man's house when he's not around? We'd like to hear your wise words, Mr. Aw. I think that the world is upside down. What weird times we're in, where the sheep wants to fuck the wolf and have his cubs! Such ambitiousness! Why did you hit my sister, Mokhtar? I just felt like it. Have you forgotten that you answer to your boss, Mokhtar El Aw? Boss? My boss is in my pants. Want me to show you? I'll kill you, Abdo Mota! I'll kill you, Abdo Mota! Men! Hit him, One-Eye! Hit him! Hit him, Saadawi! Beat him up! Go home, Mota. Your day has not yet come. Mokhtar won't leave you alone. Let him do whatever he wants. -I want to end him. -Stop this, Abdo, and think. Did you want me to let him hit my sister and tear down my garage and do nothing? I would never say that. God forbid! But you could've worked things out sipping tea at the cafe. What would that have costed you? Seven cups of tea? I would've paid. Mokhtar needed to be taught a lesson. He needed to know who Abdo Mota is. When you mess with the wolf, you get what's coming to you. You can't keep hitting everyone. Have you forgotten what he did last time? He hurt you real bad. I'm telling you, Mokhtar is nothing. His bark is worse than his bite. Bread! Crunchy bread! I haven't sold a single loaf! Bread! Has this neighborhood moved on from pita bread to baguettes? Bread! Here, eat this sandwich. -Enjoy. -Thank you, Angham. God keep your kids safe. -Thank you. -I wish I was Mikha. What is my fortune, fortune teller? Is my girl playing hard to get, or what? Bread! -Morning, Mota! -Good morning, Hamasa. -Nice spread, Mota! -Get lost! -Here are the newspapers, sir. -Great. Here are your coffees, ma'am, Mr. Nasef. -Thank you, Radi. -You're welcome, sir. Do you know a nice guy who could work as a driver here? Yes, I have one, sir. He needs to be reliable and hardworking like you. Consider it done, sir. How, how, how How can I describe, my love My state before I fell in love with you? Come on, man. Your ugly voice has ruined my mood. You be the judge, Mota. Don't you like my voice? -It's only a little hoarse. -You do sound like a horse. Abdo. I love your sister, Alia. Will you let me marry her? You're in love, too, Mikha? My sister doesn't want to get married right now. -You must be high. -Mikha is a good man. -What brings you here? -Calm down, Hamasa. Come on, man! -I want to talk to Abdo. -Hamasa, put your weapon away. -Sit down, Bohtori. -Thank you. Do you find it acceptable for me to be threatened in your hood, boss? Say what you came here to say. Man, your mother and sister are like my own family! I was only following orders, and you know that. Plus, you were one of Mokhtar's men. You well know that this was all because of his guy, Dragon. I want you to forgive me, Abdo. Just keep me out of your quarrel with Mokhtar. Calm down. Thank you, boss. Drink up, Bohtori. I'm going to hit the john. I'll be right back. -Don't piss everywhere, man. -No worries. I know that he can't be trusted, but he's our guest. -What say you, Lefty? -That's true. -Hello and welcome, boss. -"Boss"? Why haven't I heard from you lately? Have you found someone better? I could never be without you. -You're all I want. -Good girl. That's why you're in luck. Yeah. Only good girls enjoy good luck, Rabiaa. -Fine, give me some good luck. -You first, honey. I want you to tell me Abdo's secrets. And how do I get you those? Do I buy them at the shop? Enough! I know that he has a soft spot for you. He truly is a very tender guy. I'll make your tender guy... a lesson to anyone who thinks of following in his path. What's wrong? You seem upset, just because he taught you a lesson last time. No-one teaches El Aw a lesson! Are you okay, honey? I need you to think clearly, Rabiaa. Because I don't want to turn on you, okay? Search the place. Peace be upon you, and God's blessings to you. -May God accept your prayers, Abdo. -You too, Hamasa. Hand over the drugs, you two. Do I have something here? Stop fooling around and stand up! Sir, Hamasa told me that the Qibla is in this direction. If it's in that direction, I'll pray that way. Are you a comedian now? -No, sir. The Qibla is that way. -What is wrong sir? I'm a law-abiding citizen, now. I turned a new leaf, sir. We've found nothing, sir. I love listening to Al Naqshbandi hymns before I sleep. What do you mean, they found nothing? When Bohtori came over while we were smoking weed, Abdo told him to join us but remained suspicious of him. When Bohtori left, he searched the place and found the three bags of weed you told Bohtori to hide. -Do you know where he hid them? -He gave them to Rabiaa, the dancer. I'll teach them both how to dance. SATELLITE DISH AND RECEIVER FOR 150 EGYPTIAN POUNDS Mikha the retard! Mikha the retard! Mikha the retard! You're okay, Mikha. ABU IMAD'S KOSHARI You're okay. You're okay. I sent them away. Sit down. Why were they hitting me, Abdo? I haven't done anything, Abdo. -You little bastards! -They called me a retard. -Am I a retard, Abdo? -Don't say that. -Am I a retard? -You're the smartest of anyone. You're a wise man. They say, "Take wisdom from the mouths of the... sane." -What took you so long? -I did everything I could to find a way to get out without my mother getting suspicious. I had to-- -How did you do it? -No, please! -People are looking at us! -I'm going to kill you! -Let's go home, move! -Okay! -It's just us men now. -You don't understand! -It's just us men now. -You don't understand, Abdo! -It's just us men now. -You don't understand! -Just listen! Come on, Abdo! -I don't understand? Understand what? I'm here to teach you a lesson, boy! Fine, Abdo! I'll show you! I was dreading this! -I've been dreading this for a long time! -Have mercy! Stop! -Stop what? -Enough! I said many times that leaving the house for no reason would lead her astray! Stop it! Enough! Have mercy! Mercy? You fell for the worst guy in the neighborhood! -Why? -Enough! -Oh, my God! -She fell for a druggy! She's made a joke of me! Enough! What? What? Why are you so upset? He's no more a druggy than you! What? What? -No-one else is like me! -He is like you! Who did you think would marry your sister? A doctor? Wake up and smell the roses! You're an ex-con! I want you to marry a good man. -Let me go! -Come on, now! A penny for your thoughts. Here's your tea. Why are you upset? All is good now. -Thank God. -You will be the best chauffeur ever! You make me feel like I'm running for president. Why wouldn't you? Come on, cheer up. -You know, Angham... -What? Sometimes, I feel that if I had a degree, my life would be much better. But when I go to the cafe and look at the educated guys, I see that they, too, have their own problems. Anyone can get their fair share in life. Plus, you can read and write well. But where do I find someone who understands the meaning of the word... What am I saying? -Hey, old man? -Yeah. When does Mr. Nasef usually leave home? He has no schedule. Okay. I thought he was under the weather or something. No, he just doesn't have a fixed schedule. -Do you have any tea? -Yeah. Why don't you make us some? -As you wish. -Thank you. Some live in castles, and others live on the street. BUSTANI CAFE Congratulations, Abdo! Alia is next. Thanks. Hopefully, you'll see her married too, Haj Radi. -Congratulations, Abdo.

Here, girl. -Put this on. -Okay. I won't find a better chance to congratulate you and dance for you. I'm learning my lesson from you Teach my heart some more About how to let you go and forget you You are unjust to me, and your heart Has never felt anything How can I love you When you treat me so cruelly? Every time I see you You hurt me more, and I learn more But how can you be happy When I'm in pain? I thank you For all your cruelty And the pain you're causing me I never loved anyone else You are killing me I'm learning my lesson from you -Hello, Dad. -Thank you. What's with you? Why are you hiding your joint? Smoke up, don't worry. Is today a holiday or what? Your old, worn-out uncle, Radi, did in his youth what the great Abdo Mota could never do. Come on now. Abdo Mota has done it all. Not everything we do is right. We all make mistakes, one way or another. Tell me, Abdo. -Are you happy with your job? -It's good. At least it makes me feel human. Honestly, I didn't want you to marry my daughter. But she insisted and said... "Abdo has goodness in his heart. We need to bring it out in him." I'll keep Angham safe forever, Uncle. Angham is the apple of my eye, Abdo. -Congratulations, Abdo. -For what, sir? Radi said you got engaged to his daughter yesterday. -Thank you, sir. -I would've come if I was invited. I'm a traditional man, too. It was a small party, sir, and I was busy. -Hopefully, you'll attend our wedding. -God willing. Here you go, sir. -Congratulations. -Thank you, sir. No, please Abdo! Is she for real? No, please Abdo! Hello. Yeah, Angham. We're done. Good evening. -What is it, girl? -We're done! Done? I'm not here to buy weed! Don't play with me! Didn't you and your cousin Angham get engaged? And what is that to you? What is it to me? Right, because easy girls belong to no-one! Don't get it mixed up. Come on, now. You know what you mean to me. Stop it now. I... Like they say, I'm the keeper of your secrets. I'm the lowlife who holds all of your dark secrets. Secrets you can never tell anyone else. Do you know why I put up with all of this? Because I love you so much. I tell myself to be patient. "Be patient with him." -But you're nothing but a lowlife. -Don't say that, Rabiaa. I swear by your honor, I'm not lying. My mom is forcing this marriage on me. Marriage can end in divorce and other problems, but friendship lasts forever. What do you mean? Are you staying up tonight? I love you, girl. I swear. -I love you. -Stop it. God, you're so beautiful! Go! Oh, my God! What brings you here? When my brother saw us together, he cut your face and almost killed me. -What do you want? -Is that the way to greet me? I thought you would welcome me with open arms. What do you want? Have you lost your mind? Come on, beautiful. Abdo isn't here. And your mom is in a deep sleep. -Fine, Yasser. -Will you leave me at your door? Let's go inside. This isn't right. You think? This is all you'll get. Come on, now. This wouldn't be the first time. Is Abdo back, Alia? No, Mom, some kids were just playing at the door. -And making noise. The little rascals! -The little rascals! Here's more than you asked for. This is too much, Abdo. Nothing is too much for you, Rabiaa. Thank you. I don't know what I would've done without you. Don't worry. But you haven't told me. -Where did you get this money from? -I have my ways. I just got it. Why can't we leave it at that? Tell me, why do you need the money? I'm sending it to my sister in Alexandria. To pay Sayed's tuition fees. You really want him to grow up to be something. Of course, Abdo. He's all I've got. I don't want him to suffer like I did. You're a great woman, Rabiaa. -Search in here. -What's wrong? Oh, my God! -Wake up! -What did he do? -What's wrong? -Where's the jewelry? What jewelry? Calm down, sir! -We've found the jewelry, sir. -Do you remember now? -I know nothing about this, I swear! -Move! -Abdo! -I swear, I didn't do anything! -Abdo! -I swear, I didn't do anything! Abdo! Abdo! Where are you taking me? -No! -God will punish you all! -Throw him inside! -I'm innocent! Get inside! -What did you do? -Wait! -My son! -Go! Abdo! Son! Stop lying, and tell me where you were on Tuesday between 10:00 and 12:00 p.m. I finished work and gave Awad, the doorman, the car keys. I left the villa at 10:00 p.m., then I met my friend, Hamasa, and we sat in a small cafe on the coastal highway. You think I’ll believe a dangerous offender like Hamasa? Enough bullshit! Tell me where you hid the money, and who was with you during the break-in. I swear, sir, I had nothing to do with this. -Listen, Radi. -Yes, sir. You knew that Abdo was a dangerous offender. Why did you get him hired as a driver for Mr. Nasef? I thought, sir, that... maybe he had turned a new leaf. Isn't Abdo your daughter's fiancé? -Yes, sir. -Listen to this, then. -What? -Do you know that you're also a suspect in the villa robbery and murder? Me? It's not true, sir, I swear. I swear I had nothing to do with this. God help us all. Are you going to speak now, Abdo? I'll talk, sir. I'm a registered offender. I hurt a lot of people, and I was unjust. I know you won't believe anything I say. And I know that the evidence points to me. But the poor man outside is innocent. I did everything, sir. I'll leave you two alone for a while. Come and stand outside. We can't be together anymore, Abdo. You're abandoning me, too, Angham? You sold yourself out for cheap. I didn't do it. I swear, I'm innocent this time. I believed you many times before, Abdo. But I can't fool myself this time. I could lie to anyone, even the police, but never to you, Angham. But you've lied to me about everything. Even your love. -I don't understand. -Maybe Rabiaa can help. The one you spent the night with on the day of our engagement. Stop lying! I've already told you, Mokhtar, I won't give you my daughter's hand in marriage. And I've already told you that I still want her. Plus, I want to help you out, man. I won't give my daughter's hand in marriage to someone she doesn't want. I accept, Dad. She just said it! You are as wise as you are beautiful, Angham. What a girl. What have you done, Angham? -I did what's right, Dad. -Right? You did what's right? Is it right for you to marry Mokhtar El Aw? Who, then, Dad? It's either Abdo, Mokhtar, or remaining a spinster for life. I'd prefer that you remain a spinster! No, Dad. A marriage to Mokhtar would be better. Better than all these hardships we deal with daily. Life is against us! And that's not all! The police come every day to make things worse! And our neighborhood is full of criminals! Most are registered, and the rest haven't been caught yet! I'm tired of all this, Dad! I can't take it anymore, Dad! You're a faithful friend, Rabiaa. Don't say that Abdo. You're very dear to me. My bed is cold and empty without you. Are you getting visitors? My mom and Alia visit me sometimes. What about her highness? Doesn't she visit you? We went our separate ways, Rabiaa. Don't worry. I can get you anything you want. Just leave this place. You'll see what happens. Thank you, Rabiaa. Have you seen Hamasa? I saw him at Hamdi Arnoos's wedding. What are you planning to do, Abdo? I'll tell you. Mikha. Come and sit down. How are you? I want to see Abdo, Rabiaa. I wish I could help you. But it's a complex procedure. You need a permit. I'll tell him that you send your greetings. Tell Abdo that I love him very much, Rabiaa. God bless you, Mikha. I love you and I only want to be with you I would be crazy if I ever thought Of even looking at another woman Your words are like music to my ears And you're gorgeous Your cheeks are like two red apples And your lips are rosy You captured my heart with your words As if I'm struck by lightning I love you, boy I'm lost in your words And I don't remember where I am I'm too weak, I can't say no to you Help me, Mom The guy stole my heart Help me, Mom He stole my heart with his words Help me, Mom The boy is a smooth talker He touched my hand I was going to faint He touched my hair And my feet buckled under me Oh, his love! He asked for a kiss. Oh, my God! What shall I do? What shall I do? I have fallen quickly for him, Mom Please keep him here There are no two like you in the world They could write sonnets about your cheeks All poets, including Bayram, Fouad Nigm And Shaheen I couldn't find a girl like you in Italy Or Germany That's why I want to make you A statue They can put it in Ramsis Or Lebanon Square -You're like cream -No, no -So sweet -No, no -You're like cream -No, no -So sweet -No, no I want to be with her and take her As my wife And live happily with her, Mom He touched my eyes And asked me if I love him So I screamed, "Yes!" He touched my heart My heart almost stopped He asked for a kiss. Oh, my God! What shall I do? He thinks it's so easy What shall I do? What shall I do? I have fallen quickly for him, Mom And if he wants me, I can't say no Please keep him here Your heart is pure as gold And you're as sweet as honey And your lips are amazing When she smiles at me My heart melts When I see her, she sets my heart on fire And my temperature rises And when she touches me She sets me on fire I could write a hundred songs About her eyes -You're like cream -No, no -So sweet -No, no -You're like cream -No, no -So sweet -No, no She filled my heart I cannot love another I want her, Mom I won't stop till she's mine Help me, Mom The boy is giving me heartache Help me, Mom I can't think straight Help me, Mom The boy is giving me heartache Help me, Mom The boy... Help me, Mom Hey, man! My dear boy! Come here, Sayed. Come here. I missed you so much, son. Has he been like this for long? It's been a week, and the doctor says he needs to be admitted to a hospital. Honestly, sister, I can't take care of him anymore. Why, Sayed? You need to be strong and fight this. It hurts a lot, Mom. My poor son. I wish I was sick instead of you. God keep you both safe. The doctor said that he's in the late stages. Plus, with cancer... -Cancer? -I'm sorry. I didn't want to tell you, but the doctor said he has to go to the hospital... -Oh, my son! -...and cannot be treated at home. -Plus, chemotherapy is very expensive. -Oh, God! Why? God help me. What did I do? I'm just a poor woman. Oh, my beloved son! -Oh, my God! -Search the place! -What do you want, sir? -Where is Abdo? -He's in jail! -So, you don't know that he ran away? Oh, my God! Looks like he's here. Mota. -Welcome back, my friend. -How are you, Hamasa? Abdo! Don't be upset because we didn't check on you. -The police are being hard on everyone. -Don't be mad with me, Abdo. -We're friends. -We're done, Lefty. -It's over. -Tell me what you want. I'm fine. Go now, Lefty. -I need to talk to Hamasa privately. -Is that so? Fine. I don't want to see that deadbeat again. Consider him gone. Tell me, my friend. You had nothing to do with this, right? I had nothing to do with it, I swear. I was framed, Hamasa. I wish I knew who did this to me. Congratulations on your engagement, Mokhtar. -Though I wasn't invited. -Thank you, sir. I'm saving your invite for the wedding. But why are you so interested in me? I won't beat around the bush. I want Abdo Mota. And why should I get him for you? Why would I go after Abdo Mota? He's a scrawny kid and not worth my time. And who told you I'm some kind of rat? Listen, Mokhtar. You want Angham, and we want Abdo. You could say that we have a common interest. What does my fiancée have to do with this? This way, we close our case and you marry the girl without any problems. -It's a good idea. -Since you like it so much, -call me if you learn anything. -I won't just call. I'll sort it out myself. I'll do what you want. I brought you here because this is the safest place for you to hide. Sit down. -Thank you, Rabiaa. -Don't mention it. May God protect you. What do you plan to do, my friend? I don't know. After all the evil things I've done... I'm paying the price now. I got you some clothes so you can get out of that rotten uniform. I'm going to leave now. I have something to do. -See you. -I'm leaving, too. Don't worry. I'll bring you breakfast tomorrow. Rest a bit, my love. -Come on, Hamasa. -Let's go, Rabiaa. What? Did you see a ghost? What are you talking about? There's no such thing as ghosts. -Where are you going, honey? -Where do you think? -I have work to do. -How's Abdo doing, Rabiaa? Abdo again? Does he follow you in your dreams, too? He's gone. We're done now. No, we're not! Where is Abdo? Tell me! Calm down! What has gotten into you? If I found out where he was and found out that you were hiding him... I swear, I would end your life. You saw him after he busted out of prison? I did, boss. -Why didn't you inform me? -Honestly, I thought you'd forgotten about him. Where is Abdo hiding now? I don't know. But Rabiaa knows where. Rabiaa? -What do you want? -Stop jumping around! Tie her up. What do you want? What have I done? Careful! You let me down, Rabiaa. -What happens to liars, Bohtori? -They go to hell, boss. What about traitors, Dragon? They go to hell, of course! This is the law! I've done nothing! What law? What will you do to me? Have you gone mad? Shame on you, Rabiaa. You chose to be ungrateful. Who abandons heaven so they can choose hell? Who are you to distinguish between heaven and hell? Who do you think you are? This is the law, Rabiaa. What are you doing? Your fate is decided, my pretty girl. Get him! It's just me, Mikha, Abdo. Come and sit down, Mikha. How are you, Abdo? How are you, Mikha? Is anyone with you? No, I'm alone. I'm mad at you, Abdo. You're not the only one, Mikha. The whole world is mad at me. Why are you upset? Because you let Yasser marry Alia... after I told you that I love her! -What do you mean by that? -Yeah, Yasser married her. I saw them playing house together. -Abdo? -Move, Lefty. -We have nothing to talk about. -Move! Fine, Abdo. Stop here, Lefty. Get down. Get down! Is this how you're going to be, now? Yeah. -You're threatening me with your knife? -Yeah. What do you want, Abdo? Mota! Mota? I'm going to end you. Abdo, I'm your friend, Lefty! Stop squirming! Kneel. So, you fool, did you think that I wouldn't get to you? Spill, boy. Fine, I'll tell you, Abdo. Did you think I would let you cut my face and do nothing? -Spill, boy! -I destroyed your whole life! Speak! Spill, boy! I broke into the villa. And I killed the girl. And I put the jewelry in your room. Get to the end, boy. And Mokhtar El Aw orchestrated the whole thing! How did you get into my house? I'll tell you, Abdo, so you won't hurt your head thinking about it. Your sister is carrying my child, Abdo Mota. You have two choices now. You either hand me to the cops... and let everyone know about your sister. Or you can hide your sister's scandal, go to jail, and be a good uncle. I think that the second choice is much better. There's no bad blood between friends. What do you want, Mota? I want to give Hamasa his fair share. He sold me out to you but didn't get his money. -What a fair guy. -You've got it all wrong, Abdo. Stay out of this. This is between two bosses. You know what, Mota? I've always admired you. And you'll continue to admire me to the end of your days. So ambitious! That's if you leave this place alive! What they say is true, my friend. If you ever see a white crow... then you'll have a true friend. You sold me out, Hamasa. I didn't, Abdo. You destroyed your life on your own, my friend. Your friend? Stop acting like you're my friend. You look ridiculous. Try something that suits you better. Do you want to kill me, Abdo? Fine, kill me. Kill me! I won't kill you, Hamasa, because you're already dead to me. I never thought... that you would rob the villa with Yasser the Lefty... and sell out your friend... and brother. According to the verdict of case 842 in Cairo, 2012, Mohamad Abdel Rahman Abbas is found guilty. He is sentenced to death by hanging for unlawfully and willfully killing Layla Mahmoud Zinhom on 24th March, 2012. The suspect has submitted an appeal that was denied by the court... Is there anything you wish, Abdel Rahman? You're the first person who’s ever asked me that. I'll tell you what I've always wished. I wish that my sister could have had a good marriage, but being an ex-con, I prevented that from happening. So, she married Mikha, the retard, in the end. I wish that Angham could have known that I truly loved her... and that she made me a better man. But Fate did not leave me be. I wish I had asked Rabiaa to forgive me for all she had suffered because of me. I wish Mokhtar El Aw would've left me alone after I'd left him. I wish that friendship were more than a word. I wish that my friend had been faithful. I wish Yasser the Lefty had been honest with me... and asked for my sister's hand in marriage. I wouldn't have refused. I wish I'd admitted to being the father of Mariam's son, whose only fault was loving such worthless scum. I wish that my mother raises him well and teaches him what I never learned. As for me... I just wish to sell bread. Subtitle translation by Ghada Amirdash
