IN OCTOBER 1944 A "RECONQUEST OPERATION" TOOK PLACE TO ATTEMPT A POPULAR UPRISING AGAINST FRANCO'S REGIME. THE MISSION: TO INVADE SPAIN WITH AN ARMY OF A THOUSAND REPUBLICAN SOLDIERS EXILED IN FRANCE AFTER THE CIVIL WAR. MONTHS BEFORE THE OPERATION, GUERRILLA GROUPS CROSSED THE FRENCH BORDER ON SABOTAGE MISSIONS. THIS IS THE STORY OF ONE OF THOSE COMMANDOS. OCTOBER 8TH They're within aim, Sergeant. Shall we shoot? No. We'd have to take the bodies to the barracks. It's just two of them. They don't seem too dangerous. Come on, Franquito. Let's go get them. Halt! Nobody move. Easy. Put down your weapons. From now on, I'm in charge. That way there won't be any problems. It's a simple matter. We're going to the Guardia Civil headquarters, and wait for instructions. Sergeant. -So... -Sergeant. Not now, I'm talking. Come on, Gómez. Unarm them. -Sergeant. -What? Leave it. According to Sergeant Castillo, they're half a day's walk from their encampment. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. They're just kids, Vicente. They're not your students. We have a mission. And that's what matters. They don't matter. We don't matter. Can't you see they think they'll never see their families again? Those kids kidnap, humiliate, kill, our women. -Those kids! -Come on. Maybe you have to remember the faces of our comrades in front of a firing squad! Fuck me! They are going to kill us. I'm certain of it. Give me a smoke. Fire. See this bullet? Keep it. And the next time you meet one of us, remember you're carrying it in your pocket, not in your head. I didn't want to say anything to the men yet. But in Toulouse they say everything's ready. It's going to be great. Let's be wary. I'm not so sure about it. France will be freed any day now. With the Nazis gone, the Allies want only one thing. Kick Franco out and clean Europe. Why do you think 200 comrades have just crossed the border at Port Vell? In a few months' time, these hills will be full of comrades, you'll see. There it is. Let's blow up that shit. Sergeant. Get on your horse and stop wasting my time. Let's go get those bastards. Yes, Captain. Keep your eyes wide open. This is the last one. All ready. Three minutes. THE SILENT WAR Slow down! Stay close! Take cover! -What the hell just happened? -What do you think? Fucking hell, they're attacking us! Jesus, Benítez, start shooting! It's not a sausage. -Anselmo. -Vicente, it's okay. Anselmo, you've got to move! Let's go! -My leg. -I can't free you. Anselmo! Anselmo! Anselmo, leave! -I can't hear a thing! -Go! -I can't hear you! -Run! Anselmo, go! Anselmo! Buddy, you've got to go, please. Go, go, go! Come on! Go! Will you fucking leave? Run! Freeze or I'll shoot! Corporal, lower your weapon. This war won't be over until I put a fucking bullet in all your heads. What did I just say? Lower your weapon! What the fuck are you doing? Sergeant! Cross the river with some men. Bring that son of a bitch here. Get the fuck moving! Let's go! Come on, let's cross the river. Come on, son. Sargent, bring maps for the area. Soldier, my horse. Come on, soldiers, attention. Rosa! Rosa! I'm coming! What's all the fuss about? Rosa, they have Vicente, he's in the church. My Vicente. Here you go, Captain. The blueprints. They're a bit old. They'll do. Take a seat. Don't even think of it, Sergeant. It looks like the ones in cowboy movies. It's a tiger. A copy of the American 1892 Winchester. They don't make them anymore. Sergeant. Yes, Captain. Do you know these hills well? Yes, sir. Although, if you don't mind me saying so... I don't see why we're making such a fuss about finding that man. The war is over. What do you think we're doing here? Hunting down Indians, Sergeant. The prisoner? In the barn, Captain. Let's speak to him. Yes, Captain. -We'll set up our headquarters here. -Yes, captain. Come with me. Leave the package there. You'll get it later. You can't give anything to the prisoner. Are you going in to see him or not? I'm busy. -What have they done to you? -Nothing. -Are you okay? -I'm fine. Sit. Sit, Rosa, please. They're asking about Anselmo. I've told them I don't know anything. And it's true. I don't know anything. Don't worry about Anselmo. He'll know how to get to the border. What will they do to you? The one who questioned me has gone to find Anselmo. And he'll be back. He says it's up to me which of us ends up being shot. Forgive me, Rosa. Forgive me. Mrs. Rosa. Here. I've filled it with paper, so they don't notice. You know how people talk. Don't worry. I'll give the shirt and the food to your husband. Why are you doing this? Good morning. Stop! Stop! Get off! Get off the horse! I don't want to hurt you. Answer with a nod of the head. Are you carrying other weapons? No, just the rifle. I have some money. Any other weapons? No, I said as much. Answer with a nod of the head. Take your coat off. Come here. Write down the horse's name. You can change his name. That Vicente is a tough one, Captain. They're loyal. It's hard to get anything out of them. I think it won't be easy to catch the fugitive, he must be close to the border by now. Sergeant. I'll never lose a lone fighter in the hills. Anselmo will keep Vicente Jimeno company before nightfall. Someone's on the road. Thank goodness. It's Mr. Márquez. The marquis' son. What happened? A bandit. He stole my horse. I told you catching that Anselmo wouldn't be easy. Relax, quiet. Relax, I won't hurt you. I won't hurt you. Don't even think about screaming. Is there anybody home? Are you sure? I'm just hungry. Relax, I'll let you go. Don't scream. Don't scream. Is anyone coming in the next few hours? My husband. At sundown. I can't hear you, I'm deaf. Nod to answer. This is what we'll do. We'll go in, you'll make some food for me and I'll pay you two pesetas. Then I'll leave. And you'll tell no one you've seen me. Understood? Don't do anything stupid. Go in. Take it easy! Take it easy! I know him. I know him. Really. I solve it. Take it easy. I'll take care of this. -Hi, Elvira. -How are you, Jaime? What are you doing here? Well, we're patrolling with the army. We're looking for a bandit. Have you seen anyone near here? No, you know nobody comes this way. The animals, myself, and that's it. Will you pour me some wine? Yeah, sure, take a seat. -How are your parents? -Where's your husband? Out hunting. Here's your wine. Why are you avoiding me? Why don't you care about me, Elvira? I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you do know. You've understood me perfectly. I don't understand, it's... That was a long time ago. I wouldn't have you living here. Look at you. You're lost here. Isolated. In this dump. We have time. If you wanted, I... Look... Let me think about it. But right now... Let's go far away. Let's go far away together. Elvira, please. Think about it. Swear you'll think about it. Swear it. -Leave me. -Elvira! I'm sorry. Please leave. Didn't you say your husband was out hunting? No, Jaime! Jaime, stay out of trouble. Listen to me. Listen to me. Leave, please. Jaime, please. Jaime! Jaime, we've been friends since we were kids. Jaime, please! Go, please. Do it. I know him since he was a boy. He's a good person. What is happening to all of us? Thank you very much. Don't move! Don't move. Don't move! Drop your weapon. Drop the fucking weapon! He's deaf, he can't hear you. Shut up, Elvira, really. Stand back. Back! Come on! -Drop the fucking gun! -I told you he's deaf! You're on their side, Elvira. You're hiding them. You've always been on their side. -You've always been on their side! -I'm on no one's side. I just want everyone to be fine. Come on, drop the gun! Do you hear me? Drop the fucking gun! -Jaime, calm down. -Shut up! You... He's deaf, he can't hear you! Stay out of the way. He can't hear you. Rojas! Dismount! Anselmo! Do you know what? In the war I was taught how messy it is to make prisoners. You know. Everything becomes a problem. But mainly... the dumbest part of making prisoners is forfeiting the pleasure of killing an enemy. Anselmo! You can't run! I'll find you! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Run! Take cover! Turn up the music! For fuck's sake! It's these kinds of things that made winning the war worthwhile. And for having the opportunity to enjoy the humble servants of the homeland as brave as the one that honors us with her presence this moment. I've finished my mission. "I've finished my mission, Colonel." Is it Mrs, or Miss? Lieutenant. Lieutenant Sergéevich. Darya Sergéevich... Vólkov... is... a mercenary. And what are your merits to become a collaborator in our glorious Spanish army? My merits, Colonel, are all dead. Darya trained as an elite shooter in the glorious Russian army. Deliver this at the barracks. You'll get paid what was agreed. Let me ask you a question. How did you lose your eye? At Stalingrad. There was a German sniper causing many casualties among Russian soldiers. So that became... a duel. And you failed. But he didn't. Right? What matters is who fires the last shot. Colonels, it's been a pleasure. Darya! Do you know Captain Bosch? He seems to have connections in Madrid. He's requesting your cooperation to hunt down a man called Anselmo Rojas. Bosch is an expert in those matters. Then you must be a bigger expert. Fuck! There's an envelope with your instructions at the barracks. I want you to go there and eliminate that Rojas. And everyone's happy! She has a bad temper. Of course. Like to be your girlfriend. Do not even think about it. Colonels. Here. It'll be good for you. Do you want more? Are you hungry? Where are you? Your hiding place... Everybody knows. -I can't hear you. -You can't? I can't hear you, an explosion left me deaf. I can't hear a thing. They're looking for me, and I need a few things. Sorry. They're looking for me, and I need a few things. I don't know where they are, but I know they're looking for me. All right. Wait. Come on. Look. This man is a friend of your father. He can't hear because he had an accident. I want you to write down everything I tell you. All right? Good girl. Vicente is under arrest. What will they do to him? I don't know. But you have to get away. You have to run away. No. They won't stop until they find you. You write really well. Thank you. Where did you learn? Here. -At school? -Yes. -The village school? -Yes. Is it still open? The best thing, given my circumstances, is for me to stay hidden. The invasion is imminent, Rosa. We'll be free again. At your service, Captain. You have a visit. They're waiting upstairs. Help! Last night someone killed a villager. An old man who sold cheese. Do they suspect me? I already told the Captain... I don't know anything. Vicente and I would like to speak in private. You won't believe me, Vicente, but... I know all too well what you're experiencing. Now you think everything's lost. My father loved these situations. Trips to hell. I know the peklo all too well. Your hell. The Russian army recruited me... when I was fourteen. Someone from the Russian federation informed them I had weapon skills. After that, everything snowballed. They sent me to the front line, and I started killing. Without realizing it... every day... I travelled to the peklo... I did my job... and went back. One night... Waiting for my target. It was winter and hours passed very slowly. As soon as my victim appeared... I felt fear. A deep fear. One day all this will be over. And the time will come when... there won't be anyone... to shoot. Then I understood... that I would never... return from the peklo. No! But you... have the chance of returning from the peklo. It's simple. Look at me! This is the last time I'm asking! Where is Anselmo Rojas? -Good morning, Josefa. -Good morning, Rosa. Give me some carrots and a couple of leeks. Do you have pork? I want a cut. I have some inside. What's up? Are you celebrating? My girl is a bit indisposed. She has a fever and you know how that... I'm not interested in illness. The bedbugs are eating me alive. Do you find that normal? -Good morning, sirs. -Good morning. Good morning. It's good pork, you'll see at home. I also asked for a couple of leeks. -How much is it? -Don't worry, you can pay another day. Don't you realise we're giving it all? -What are you doing? -Shut up, stupid. Don't you know who this bitch is? I'm sorry, ma'am. Forgive my partner... Soldiers! Out. Ma'am, forgive my soldiers' behavior. Prepare this for me. Rosa. I hope your girl gets well. Thanks. Your daughter. Go and play. Go along. Go home. Quick. I'll be there in no time. Hurry up. Come on. I'll give you some advice. Talk with your husband. We both know he won't tell me anything. The longer he takes, more people will suffer. Vicente doesn't know where Anselmo is. He told me so. And my husband doesn't lie to me. You bitch! I hate women like you. Women that are no more than their husband's shadow. You're no more than pets. Come here, bitch! Halt. This is from less than three hours ago. Dismount. Sergeant, that man is dangerous. Fucking dismount! No one will take a shot until I do so, Franquito! Go up the ridge, I'll explore the river. Sergeant. Be careful. Anselmo, turn around. Anselmo! Anselmo! Listen to me, calm down, take it easy. Relax. Listen to me. Don't move. Don't move. Anselmo, look me in the face. You have to cross the river. There are two men up there. Anselmo. Listen to me, Anselmo. Here. Relax. Sons of bitches! Sargent, no! TOBACCO Let's get him, Corporal. He's just one, we're two. Yeah. And a while ago he was one and we were three. Do whatever you want, I'm leaving. OCTOBER 3OTH Where were you? I haven't heard from you in weeks. I thought you'd be dead. Everything is lost. You don't know about it, do you? INVASION FAILED The invasion has failed. I'm scared! There. It's okay. That's it. That's it, it's okay. Anselmo! Anselmo! Don't look, Rosa. Don't look. Caudillo! Look at the bastard run. Smoke that rat out of its den. You want us to go in? Is there a problem, soldier? No. I want him alive. The sniper left with four men. How long ago? Some 45 minutes ago, Captain. Last night they saw Rojas leave the prisoner's wife's house. Gather all the men. Damn rat. Are you coming out or do I have to make you? What shall we do? Go to the back. What? Go to the back and prove you're not a fucking girl! It's a horse. It's a horse! How many are outside? Please. No, please. Show me how many are out there with your fingers. I don't know. I don't... know. One! One. One. Close your eyes. You won't stay in there all your life. But I will. I'll need you again. But this time you have to run faster than ever. If not, none of us will make it out alive. Son of a bitch. One. Two. Son of a bitch. Die. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me! I said, look at me. Captain! Good afternoon, ma'am. Can I come in? What can I do for you, Captain? Come here. Come here, don't be afraid. Come closer. Closer! Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. I see you can write. Do you like going to school? Yes. Speak louder, I can't hear you. I said yes. Who is your teacher? Father Bustillo, sir. I know him. A good patriot. Learning is good for you. The history of your country teaches you where we come from. And, most importantly, where we're going. Knowledge is important. To be able to confront your enemies. And outsmart them. Tomorrow we'll free your father. Are you happy? Here. A gift. Take it. Take it. I don't want to lie to her. These are hard times. And you never know. But we feel things in this village are getting complicated. And it's in no one's interest. Do you understand? Vicente doesn't seem to know anything. So... the best thing is to let time run its course and wait for things to calm down. And then God will tell. It would be helpful... This is just a piece of advice. If your husband would lay low for a long while. We might call him in every now and then to question him. Come here. Come here. Come here, honey. Are you okay? "Today they're releasing Vicente. You have to take him to France. He's suffering, and they won't leave him alone. I heard about yesterday's five soldiers. They won't stop until they find you. You have to run away. I don't want to argue, Anselmo, please. Pick up Vicente tomorrow at dawn. At the bridge. Rosa." Why did they release you? Anselmo! -Where are you? -Don't move! What did you tell them, so they released you? I didn't say anything. -I'm alone. -They never free a fighter, you know it! Anselmo, I'm alone. -Why did they release you? -Calm down. Calm down. Come. Don't move! Don't move or I'll shoot you. -I'm alone. -You've betrayed me, haven't you? You've betrayed me. -I'm alone. -That's why they released you. -Anselmo, there's no one. -Sons of bitches. Sons of bitches. Are you there? Anselmo, calm down, there's no one! -Are you there? -There's no one, Anselmo! -Come out, you fuckers! -There's no one! Come on! There's no one, Anselmo! Buddy! Traitor! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Buddy. I've got you. What shall we do about Rojas? Anselmo Rojas is already dead. NOVEMBER 8TH Rosa, don't look. Goodbye.
