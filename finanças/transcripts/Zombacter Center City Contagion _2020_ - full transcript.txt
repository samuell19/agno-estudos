- No, no, no. No, it's not that I don't trust your judgment. I just want to give him the best treatment possible. Hey, try paying a little more- Numerous accounts of random violence and looting are being reported. We go live now to the streets of Downtown Philly to KNE reporter, Don Philips. Don, what can you tell us about the reports we've been getting? - Damn it. Jen, I'm so sorry. I've got a meeting. - Yeah, my dad's waiting for you. - Oh. How long has he been there? - Long enough. You should go. - Oh, right. Okay, I'm sorry. I'll see you tomorrow. - Bye. Ron, good to see you. - Don't give me that crap, Northrop. You're late. - Midterms. I uh. I got tied up. I'm sorry. - Enough. Just show me the progress on my bio-computer. - I, I just. I need to. - Oh, by all means. - So, just take a look at a couple of the screenshots from yesterday. It works. - Is this real? Because if it is. - It's real, all right. And in a couple of months we're gonna have much more than a bio-computer. - What are we talking about here? I thought we were on the same page. - Well, we're talking about artificial intelligence. - Oh, don't start that again. One slip up, and our funding is gonna get yanked. - My creation is gonna be able to do more than any person, or any machine could ever do. - You need to keep your eyes on the prize. Forget about AI. - But it is key to- - Damn it, Jake that's enough! Hello. Hello? Stupid phone. How the hell did you get this to work? - So the bacteria, doesn't feed off the rabbits. It uses the nutrients that I provide. See, I've created a symbiotic relationship. I suppress the immune system until the bacteria settles, and then. - It sounds time-consuming and expensive. - It does take some time to work out the kinks, but I've engineered the bacteria to activate the pleasure centers in the brain. - So the rabbit gets rewarded for not killing the bacteria. - Exactly, and then we just harvest the neural network whenever it's ready. And the spider silk genes that I've added help provide stability. I mean, it's. It's elegant, if I do say so myself. - Harvest them, like you're picking apples. You just harvest them? - That's not fair. Look Ron, what we're doing here, this could revolutionize the entire planet. And we own it. - Just make sure that bacteria of yours is not a problem, and you'll have what you need. - Close one, huh guys? All right, come on buddy. There you go. You got it? Good job. Good job. Oh, don't look at me like that. Good job. I'll catch you tomorrow. Good night, fellas. Next. Careful with that. - Where is this going? - I've got it on there. - That'll be $23.19. I need you to sign for this. - Yeah. - Thanks. - Do you need a receipt? - I'm good. - Okay, cool. Well, have a good day. - You too. - Oh my God. What happened? - The little bastard bit me. - Oh my God, are you okay? - No. He bit me. - Well, he's probably just scared. - Hey look, they stopped fighting. - Barney's hurt. Look at his leg. - I know. I know. How's Algernon? - I can't tell. It looks like he. Oh, gross! - Awe, shit. Come on, we better get the professor. Dr. Northrop, we need you downstairs. Something happened with the rabbits. What? - Well, they're not fighting now. What happened? - I don't know. - I gotta put him down. Come here, buddy. Can you get that door for me? Go get the hand checked out, Ruben. What's with all the tunnel maps? You can't do any more here, okay. Just, go get that looked at. Yeah, all right. So you say this was a lab animal, Mr. Stanley? - A rabbit. - I'm sorry? - It was a rabbit. - Was it vaccinated for rabies? - I don't know. I think so. I mean, the university should have some papers on him somewhere. - Look, it's been a long night, Mr. Stanley. But we need to cover all the bases. Heard you had a disagreement with a rabbit. I trust the rabbit's worse off than you are. - Well, yeah. Lab rabbits were fighting. Got bit trying to break them up. - Were the rabbits ill? - No, I don't think. - Well. You don't have anything to be concerned about. You're gonna need a tetanus shot. Round of antibiotics. Take some acetaminophen for the pain and try not to get between any more fighting rabbits. Thank you. - I'll get that drawn up, and have someone in to give you your shot. Ah, shit. Hey. I been hit. Oh, God. I'm going to die. I'm in the prime of my life. Get up you lazy bum, you're worse than I am. How long have you been laying down there? - Oh, shit. Bill get down, it's real. It's real. Man, what the hell did you kick me for? - Time to get moving. I'm gonna need some more medicine, man. You owe me. I ain't got nothing. And it's slim pickings up down, brother. - I don't owe you nothing. You know what? Get on up outta here, man. Leave me alone. - To do what? Come on, let's go. - All right, man, every time. Find a good spot and lay down in a good spot. It's a man's world. My daughter was around those goddamn rabbits. You told me people were safe. They are. - That's not what your voicemail said. I want this, all of this, gone. The rabbits, and the crap that you stuck them with. - What? No no, no no, I'm way too close. Maybe you didn't hear me Northrop. I said get rid of them. - Just. Look, just give me, give me a few days. - I'm telling you to find something else. - The investors are not gonna wait for something else. - You heard what I said, Northrop. - Oh. Sorry, Dr. Langley. I didn't see you. - Get rid of those rabbits in Northrop's lab. - I thought those were for the bio-computer. - Not anymore. Get rid of him. - Yes, sir. - Sorry buddy. It's all right. That a boy. I got you, I got you. This is only gonna hurt for a second. Blaine, I'll be back in a bit. - Is Rubes in today? I wanted to give him his book. - Just leave on my desk. But oh, don't touch anything. And, stay away from the animal cages. - Yeah, okay. Whatever you say. Later, douche. God. God. Sucks for you, dude. Goddamn it! Thai food. Hell yeah. - Jennifer, where's Ruben? - His grandmother's sick. - Look, I need you to get all the files from October 23rd through today. - What am I looking for? - Anything unusual in the tissue samples. Compare them with the images from before the incident. What's going on? - I also need to get blood samples from everybody who's worked in the lab. - Wait, what? - I'm just looking for an antibody to the bacteria. Nobody's sick. - I thought you said that this research- - Our research is not dangerous. So get the samples. And get Blaine down here. I'll be in my office. This just in. Numerous accounts of random violence and looting are being reported. We go live now to the streets of downtown Philly to KNE reporter, Don Phillips. Don, what can you tell us about the reports we've been getting? - Charlene, all we know was that earlier this morning police were cordoning off sections of Ninth and Market Street, including Terminal Market. In what may be an ominous sign, police have been steadily increasing the barricades over the past hour. - Don, any word from officials about what might be causing this? - Right now, officials are warning curious onlookers to stay away, and- - What's going on? - I don't know. But I know somebody who might. Stay put, keep looking at the samples. - I'm not gonna stay here by myself. - Stay put. It's almost dark outside. You'll be safe here. All the trouble's in Center City. - Jason? All our rooms are currently full at the moment. But, what brings you in here today? - My neck. - Your neck? Okay, what happened? Something's biting on you. On a scale of one to 10, could you tell me what you're pain is? - Heather. - Jake? What are you doing here? - I'm just looking for you? The riots been all over the news. These people look sick, they don't look injured. What's wrong with them? - I don't know. The flu, maybe. There's been a lot of blunt force trauma, bite marks. - Bite? From what? - People. Look Jake, I gotta go. - Are you telling me that the flu and the bites are related? - I saw a woman bite one of the other patients today. - But what does that have to have to do with the flu? - Jake, I gotta go. - No, this is important. - Look, we saw the same lady a week ago, and we thought she had the flu. - All right, is there some place that we can go talk about this? - No, Jake. Can't you see I'm working? What is wrong with you? - Are you all right? - I'm sorry. I'm just tired, and I gotta go. - Heather, I know when you're lying. I mean, we lived together for eight years. Wait. We gotta go. - No, you have to go- - No, no no, we have to- - I have to see people. - Just listen to me, please. You gotta trust me. Please you- - Jake, what is wrong with you? I am not leaving him, Jake. All right, we'll bring him with us, come on. We gotta go. Let me grab him a room. - Hurry. Carl, can you help us out here a little bit? Call the police, please. Call the police. I haven't been able to get through. I need to call the University. - You don't need to call the university. This is an emergency. Come on, Carl. Can you hear me, baby. - Ruben, Ruben, Ruben. Is Jennifer there with you? Hello? Damn it. Come on, we need some bandages or something, Jake, geez. We gotta go, we gotta go. I'm not leaving him. - Can you walk, Ma'am? Ma'am? Heather. - She's gone. They're coming. Please let me in. - No, no no, Heather. I think that's Mary. - It's not, I'm telling you. No, I'm telling you it's not. - I'm gonna help her, Jake. - What are you talking about? I've gotta help her. I'm going to help her. What is wrong with you, Jake? - Look out, look out. Get back. Stop. Stop, stop! Jake, what have you done? - We gotta go. We gotta go. - Carl, I need you to get up. We gotta go. I need you, I need you to come with me. I need you, Carl. Come on, I'm sorry. We gotta. I'm sorry, we gotta go. I can't stop that thing. - No. - Come on. - Ah, shit. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but we gotta go, okay. I'm sorry. Hey come on. You gotta come with us. You guys gotta get out of here. - What's wrong with those people? Why are they doing this? - Come on, let's go. We can talk about it later. Some of those people back there looked, I don't know, dead. Come, come. Who is it? - something's up there. Yeah, no shit. - You guys stay here, all right. I'm gonna go take a look. Go get Heather. - All right, all right. Let's get out of here. - What's going on? Doc. You might need this. - Oh man. - Hey, hey. - Thanks. - Hey. You're gonna give him the gun? - What else is he gonna use? - Shh, guys. - What are we gonna use? - You want them to come down? What if he doesn't come back? - Go. Go go, go go, go go go. All right. Hang on, let me get the lights. I'm a professor at the university. - Well, Doc. Seems to me like you've got a hell of a zombie problem. - Who are you? Where's the guard? Name's Bill. I don't think they're coming. - Don't I know you? That bum. He panhandles down on Market. - He just saved all of our asses. You apologize! - What? Hey, it's all good. It's true. - But, we are grateful, Bill. Would you know anywhere we could stay that's safe for the night? - Well, we could try the tunnels. But I just as soon get out of the city. - I need to go to the university. Why the hell should we go to university? Can't we just stay here and wait for the police? - We are hip deep in these things. Well, what about the police? We could go to Jersey. You've got a rifle, and you can protect us. - You go where you want. I'm going to the university. - You are out of your mind. And that is just as- - I have staff and equipment at the university that just might save all of our asses. I think that we might be able to develop a vaccine of sorts. - What are you hiding? Is there something you're not telling us about these things? - We were, we were developing a bio-computer and I think that it might have had something to do with what's happened. - Great. So you made zombies. How? - I don't know. Look, what is that? Hey, hey, hey idiot. You're gonna give the mad scientist your gun? Moron. This is an EMP weapon. - Well whoop-de-do. - This might do some damage to a whole bunch of them. How? - I think that, I mean I hope that it will stun them. You hope? You hope? You don't even know, do you? Listen, I think I think that this just might buy us enough time to where we can get someplace safe. Here, you should take the lead. - I think that's a good idea. - How'd you get to the hospital tonight? - How'd you? I was just checking on somebody that I saw, make sure that they got some help. - Who? - I saw this guy get attacked by one of those things. He said he was a doctor. Carl? Yeah, Carl, I think he said. - Carl Wurling. - You know him? - What happened? - Well, this buddy of mine, Marvin, him and his friends ate something they found in a dumpster over by the terminal. I told him not to, but. What was it? Rabbit. Damn thing was frozen solid. They must not have cooked it good enough. I don't know. What's matter, Doc? You like you've seen a ghost. We heard noises behind us. Let's get moving. Ah, Jesus. So anyway, I told Marvin he needed to get to the hospital but he, I thought he had food poisoning or something. What happened? - Well, I went back to check on him. Shit, he had changed. I mean, he looked real bad and smelled even worse. And then he came after me, so I just took off running. Well I saw him get your friend. Marvin's dead. I think he was dead the first time I saw him. - I'm sorry. - Ah, he was a tough old bastard. I'll give him that. He took down two of them SWAT boys before I. Well, I had to put him down. That's how I got this. Get down. Get down. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Carl! - Unh-uh, uhn-uh, uhn-uh. He does not look good. - I found some morphine. It's gonna wear off pretty soon, though. - How the hell did you get out of the hospital? - What do you care, you son of a bitch? You left me there to die. - I just smeared zombie guts on myself. - We gotta get him to the university. You are out of your mind. God, what if he gets his blood on me? - Ah, shut your whining, you little pussy. I had this so much. Hold it, and don't move. Drop it. Drop it! We're gonna pass you by, and we're going up to the university. - Shut up. - Now, see this guy behind me? He's a professor there. Look out behind you. - Oh, you think I'm stupid? You say it again, and I would blow your head off. Now Ma'am, listen. We're gonna back off a little bit, and we're gonna circle around, and we're going up to the university. No, you're not. God, I've been shot. - All right, show's over. Heather, Heather. Heather? I've been shot, Oh my God. Put pressure on it. I am putting pressure on it. It's not stopping. - Forget her. She's as good as dead. Help me Carl, help! Put pressure on the wound. - I am putting pressure on it, but it won't stop. Just stay with me, don't do this. I'm gonna die. - Don't do this to me, don't. Come on, let's go. Gun shots gonna bring them. Gotta get out of here. Come on. Carl? - Up here! Hey! You're just gonna get yourself killed. - Look, it's not gonna take long. Why didn't you take Jameson, and catch up with the others? - Goddamn it, Doc. We ain't gonna know what the fuck to do. - Look, I don't plan on getting killed. Just get moving. Suit yourself. One more thing. Shit. - You owe me, buddy. - Oh my God. Mister. Hello? - How can I trust you? - What's your name? - Chris. - Jake. You okay? - I don't know. My wife's sick. - Where is she? - In the bathroom. - All right. Let's go get her. - I'll go. - Look, I know you've been to a lot. But you have to trust me, okay? Back up, get away from it. Get out of here. Leave us alone. It's not your wife. It's just like one of those things in the lobby. You're crazy, man. She just needs help. How long ago was she bitten? Two weeks ago, maybe three? How do you know that? That's not important. Yes it is. Look, we're running out of time. Chris! Not like this. - My next door neighbor. He attacked her. He got me too. We both got sick a few days later. I got better. She just kept getting worse. - How long ago were you bitten? - About, four days ago. Only four days? - Yeah, why? - Here. You need to smear this all over you. - No way. - It's those things up there. - I can't. Oh God. You ready? Are they still out there? - Ready? - Oh, shit. - Those things can hear. Come on, Jake. I'm coming. Jameson, at their heads! Bill. - Good to see you, Doc. I picked up a couple of strays along the way. You good to shoot? - Yeah. - All right here, take this. It's fully loaded, but the battery's almost dead because we've been using it all day. Listen, there's 1000 of them out there. Oh, I got something else for you too. Look, body Armour. It's tough as nails. Watch this. See, not a scratch. - Too hot. You wear it. - Suit yourself. All right, you ready? - Just let me catch my, my breath. - Well, you better catch it in a hurry. - Oh, shit. - Because here they come. You guys ready, boys and girls? I'm out. - There's too many. Here they come again. All right. - What the hell was that? Just a little something I picked up on the way. Come on. Come on, pick up those feet kid. Heather's gone. Wait, wait. I can't keep going. It's all I got. You have to. Oh, goddamn it. At least the rain stopped. You guys look a little wore down. Jameson and I will take him from here. Yeah, yeah. Get over there. - Jameson, come on it's just once. Please. Try to be helpful. You got him? Take it easy. Doc, here you go. You good, Bill? Is that water? Free of dead weight. It's a half mile. - You're okay, buddy. And what is that smell? - Come on, man. - Where are the insects coming from? Did you screw up, and make those too? You know, I'm the one that got shot here, and yet I'm the one having to carry zombie boy. God. - He saved your ass! - He's the one who screwed up. He's the one who caused all this. - Why do you have to complain about everything? It seems like the world's coming to an end, and somehow the most annoying thing is you. I got fucking shot. Just a fucking scratch. Both of you, shut up! - Be quiet. A man can't hear himself think. - He's the one who's caused all this shit. He needs to be taken fucking care of. - Listen, you little mother fucker. If you say one more fucking smart ass thing, I'm gonna cut your fucking head off, and I'm gonna shit down your neck. Do we understand each other? You good back there? - We're fine. He might behave now. Let's go. - Can we go? - It should have been locked. - Well, you know ain't no fucking zombie unlocked it. - You ready? - Yeah. Go. Yoo-hoo! Ho! Anybody home! Shut up, you ass hat. Obviously, there's nobody here. Now listen, Doc said it might be a good idea to warn them. - Wait, wait wait. Be quiet, be quiet. - What'd you hear? - I don't know, it sounded like a door. Just sit tight, okay? Be right back. - I got your back. Jameson, a little fucking help here. He fucking smells. We all have issues. - Now listen, Chris. All right, there's a classroom right down there on the right. Why don't you take Carl in there? That'd be a good place for you guys. You can get some rest. You have a phone? - Yeah. - All right here. You see, you hear anything at all, you call me, okay? Just keep trying to call anybody, all right? Just call until you get a hold of somebody. You got a phone? Jameson. - What? - Do you have a phone? - Nope, no phone. - You know better than to ask me. All right. We gotta clear the entire place, all right? We're gonna start at the top, work our way down. All right? Everybody stay tight. We'll meet back here. Keep your eyes open. - This is way better than Jersey. - This ain't good, Doc. Them things been in here. Doc? It's Mr. Skinner, our janitor. What do we do now? What about these footprints running up the stairs? Looks like it was somebody being chased. We can't just leave him here. - We'll come back for him later. All right. We need to make sure that nothing gets into those stairwells. - I'll do it. - It's too dangerous. Let me come with you. - Oh, all right. - Oh, proud of you, Jameson. You're almost a stand up guy. - I'll take the stairwell without... - What? The dead guy? Whatever. - What a jerk. Heard that. - All right listen, once we clear this floor I'll call out. But we do this as a team, okay. - So are we a team? - What? - You do you need to take it out on them. They don't need that shit. - Are you done? - Oh, yeah. You need to keep it together, Doc. - Just don't shoot anybody, okay. Until we know that they're not, human. Doc? - I don't know, there's something. There's something barring the door. Jennifer. Jennifer, it's Dr. Northrop. Just leave me alone! Go away! - Jennifer, are you okay? Is Ruben in there with you? Jennifer, listen. Jennifer, listen to me. We need your help, okay? How do I know you're not like him? - Like who? Stay where I can see you. Only you can come in. - Okay. - This is not a good idea. - I don't want to scare her. - Yeah, I bet. - That's far enough. I need to see your face. All right, I'm coming inside. - Wait, stop. - Lower your hands. - It's me. - Do it now! Professor? Oh, thank God. Oh, you smell terrible. Where's, where's Ruben? Whoa whoa, whoa whoa. Who did this to you? Everything all right in there? Yeah, yeah. Come on in. - Wait. No, this isn't right. - All right, Doc get down. I can't get a clear shot. - How's your aim? - Why? Stop. Ruben, don't hurt him. - Ruben? - Don't play dumb with me, professor. Look what you did to me. - Come on. Come on buddy, you can do it. - You killed him. - Talk to me, talk to me. Talk to me. Ha ha, ha ha. Son of a bitch. - You shot me. - Yeah, I thought I'd killed you. Scared me half to death. You're not dead. I knew that. - Oh, geez. How'd you know I was wearing the vest? Well I didn't. I was just trying to shoot that asshole in the head. Oh, I figured you'd put it on. - So shooting me was your plan? Well, it had to work. That son of a bitch was hell bent on just kicking your ass. So I took away his play toy, and it pissed him off. - You shot me! I told you that body armour'd come in handy. - I think you broke my sternum. Did you kill him? No, not exactly but I heard a bunch of noise. Come on, get up. - I'd be careful. He's right here. It was here a second ago. Well, it ain't here now. - Chris. Is that you? - Yeah. You guys doing all right down there? - Yeah, stay put. We're coming to get you. - What's going on? Nevermind. Man, you got here fast. I'll meet you half way. - No. No, no, no wait, wait. Chris. - Jake? You're still an idiot. - Hold it right there. Ruben? Blaine. Oh, God. God ain't got nothing to do with that. - No no, no no. Wait, wait wait. Wait. Blaine, it's Dr. Northrop. Doc, what do you think you're doing? Just give me just a second. Blaine. Do you remember me? What the fuck are you doing? I needed him alive. You think that thing was still alive? - The thing downstairs knew who I was. Oh, come on. - Ah, Doc's right. Fuckin A. It's got Ruben's memories, and I gotta find out why. - Hey guys, you might want to see this. - Goddamn it. Wait. Where's Carl? - Yeah, where is he? - Well, he ain't here. - Well, he didn't walk out of here by himself. - Well now, wait a minute, Doc. Are you thinking that- - What would it want with Carl? - This isn't fucking working out. We're just getting picked off one after the other. We need to maintain visual contact with each other. Come on guys. - Where's Jameson? Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me. He was infected? He was bitten. Bitten? Was there anybody else here bitten? Mary, were you bitten? - Look, there's no time for this right now. We've got to get him down to my lab. - What do you mean it's not the time? Do you want me to make a fucking appointment during office hours? - Look, time is on our side right now. But we've gotta act fast, okay? - Well, why don't we just cut his fucking head off, and take that downstairs? - What? - No, no no. I need him in one piece. Let's just, let's drag him down the hall. - What the fuck is going on? - Jesus. - One more thing. Remember what you said back there, about being bit? - Damn it. - He was still, you know, Ruben, but what he did to me. - What did he do to you? - Let's talk about you and me. - What? - I see the way you look at me. I know what you want. - What the Hell is wrong with you? Is everything all right? - Yeah. Yeah, we gotta. Let's get the power back on. Well, why don't you tell us where this breaker panel is? - Right up here by the elevators. What is that? - Fuck if I know. - Shams. - Are you sure? - Yes. Go. I don't like the sound of this. - Just open the door. Send the fucking brown guy- - Stay low. - No, don't shoot. Don't shoot, it's me. - Where were you earlier? - I was guarding the stairwell, like you said. Oh, bullshit! - No no, I swear. I promise. I heard somebody go in there, and I, I, I, I thought it was one of you guys. So I came in here, and I thought. And that's what I remember. He's fucking lying again. - No, I swear to God. - You coward. You're a coward. - He might be telling the truth. - I swear to God. - I say you might be telling the truth. You got some blood on your head. - I promise- - Shut up! - God- - Say one more thing! - Well, you don't have to get all- - All right, all right, all right. Goddamn it! Jake! Be cool. We don't need this now. - This is great. What's wrong with him? I didn't do anything. He might've got knocked on the head. Well, let's get him out here. - Get off me, get off of me, psychopath. Let him go. Let him go. - Get off of me. Psycho. God. God. God. Crazy. Let's get going. Let's go. - Oh, sure. Sure, go with him. Go with him. He's gonna get you all killed. Guys? Guys? Guys? Hey, guys. Wait for me. Shouldn't you put that thing, out it's misery first? What the Hell is that? Spider silk. I engineered the bacteria to produce it. - Nice work. - What? Get the lights, will you? Yeah, that's my bacteria all right. But something's not right. It's not even supposed to be affecting people. What's the matter? Hey, guys? You're freaking me out. What are you staring at? Are you feeling okay? - Yeah. God, what's wrong with you people? What are you looking at? What's on me? I knew this was gonna happen. Shut the fuck up. You're not helping. Just try to relax. - You relax. You're staring at me like a bunch of freaks. What's on me? I don't understand. What's happening to me? You're infected. - Infected? You mean I have that stringy crap in my head? Listen, I can help you, if you just let me try. Oh, shit. - Jennifer. - Hit the lights. Get the lights, damn it! I'm trying. Getting outta here. Holy shit, fuck this. I'm Trying, I'm Trying. There. - Oh, fuck. Hey, so what are you doing? - I'm stopping her infection. Her body's fighting it off. The only problem is, it just might kill her. Why? - Her disease has progressed too far. So what are you gonna do? - I'm gonna try and stabilize her, until I can work something out. - Oh, so that's your big plan, huh? You're gonna shoot us up with that crap, and hope the zombie shit plays nice. - You feeling all right? - Oh, don't you worry about me. Don't you put this on me. I just need a drink. This ain't got nothing to do with your shit, that you made up. Goddamn it. , Doc, is she gonna be okay? - I'm doing the right thing. This thing is spreading faster than anything I'm familiar with. And you don't have to be bitten to become infected. He didn't look sick, neither did Jennifer. She didn't look sick either. - He was bitten four days ago. Jennifer has been maybe a day ago. But her disease is presenting like she's been infected for weeks. Oh, so you bring us back here to do one of your little experiments on us. Well, I didn't want anything to do with it. - Then leave. It's all around us now. Anything could be spreading it. - Why didn't you tell us this before? - I made it out of harmless soil bacteria! - It isn't fucking harmless, now is it? Why would you do such a thing? - It wasn't supposed to infect people. I don't, I don't know what happened. I mean, I've, I've tested the surfaces in the lab here, and it's everywhere! Okay. - So, about how long we got? - Well, it depends on how long we've been infected, and. Hard to say. - Well, take a fucking guess! - A couple of days. If you're lucky. Do something, God. - Hey, wake up. Wake up! What's your name? I know you're in there. Come out and play. Hey! Now what do we have here? You? You're the doctor that treated me. Is that? You gotta be kidding me. You and her? Oh, this is too good. Carl. I think this is the start of a beautiful relationship. - Hey! Hey, buddy are you okay? I just had something in my eyes. But I'm better now. - Way you were hollering back there, you scared the crap out of me. Why don't you come over here and have a drink? Hey. Hey. - I think these antibiotics just might save us. - I am not drinking that. And you all shouldn't either. - What about the CDC? - Do you think we're stupid? I can't get through? - Nothing. What do you have there, Doc? - It's antibiotics. They use it to treat MRSA. - Nothing works against MRSA anymore. It still works. It just doesn't work as well as it used to. Let me get this straight. You want us to take some outdated meds? - You got a better plan? - Yeah, I got a better plan. How's this for a plan? You take that vile of piss water you got there, you stick it up your ass sideways, and you set fire to it. Now, how's that for a plan? I ain't drinking that shit. - Bill. - Don't you follow me. - Jameson. - I'm not following you. - You should stop them. They're grown men. What if those things are out there? You should stop them, please. - Well, I should stop them? I should stop them? - You said you'd help us. - Yeah, I am fucking helping you. Get out. Go, all of you go. Get out. - Come on. - I thought I told you to leave. - Where the Hell's my daughter? - Oh, Ron. Oh, man. - Shut up! She told me she'd be here, now where is she? - Look, let me explain. - Enough! This, this is all your fault, isn't it? Oh yeah. This reeks of you! - Let's just wait a minute. - One more word out of you, and so help me! - Daddy? - Baby. Oh, Baby are you all right? - Now Ron. Ron, I wouldn't do that if I were you. - You! Oh, I'm not finished with you. When this all over, I'll see to it that you never work anywhere near a university again! Ron, you don't understand. - Enough! Just leave us alone. - Ron, please stop. - Baby, no. Not you, no. Please don't do this to me, please. Please don't do this to me, please! Don't come any closer, Baby, please! I can help you! Don't come any- No! No! Jennifer? Do you, do you remember me? - You did this. - Shit. - Well, maybe it's just me, Doc but I don't believe she's getting back up. You look like you can use a little pick me up too. Try that. Everybody's waiting for us outside. It was a beautiful day too. Sun was shining and everything. I thought you left for good. - Nah. Every time I go away, you get in trouble. I gotta stick around. - You shouldn't have come back. Huh? We need each other, buddy. Yeah, I see what you need. - Why, you piece of shit. You little shit. - What'd you say to me? - You heard me. You go slinking off, you go wandering away so that nobody can tell you that you were wrong. And that's cowardice to me. - I've had about enough of your shit. - Get you some mother- What the hell was that? - I don't know, but it sounds like the Calvary's here. Guess we get to finish this later. - Just a little something for you to look forward to. - This isn't over. - I hope to God it ain't. Where'd all these guys come from? I don't know. They just started showing up. That last round sounded like an RPG. Someone else is shooting a few blocks over, look! Get inside everybody, now. Get inside everybody, now. - Maybe they can help us. - Get inside. Come on quick, now. Get inside. Get inside. Shut the door, shut the door. Jameson, you spineless cunt! Here they come. Hey, wake up. What's your name?
