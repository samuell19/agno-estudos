A school with only good looking boys. Who all live in dormitories, that school is Osaka High. A new student from America has transferred there... by the name of Ashiya Mizuki. Gender is female. But there's a person who's made me satisfied just to see him smile. I think that is love. So he finally began. We can't just take him back. Let us see how determined he really is. We'll accept him if he can meet the standards of district rally requirements. Jump. If it wasn't for me, Sano wouldn't have to go through such pain... I'm back. Back from "Home of the Sea". I'm so tired. Nanba-senpai's mother is tough. That old bag's hobby is to torment hotties. The summer is not over yet, I'll not let it. Let's go on and enjoy the summer. I'm back. I wonder what the progress on the water pipe repairs is? I heard it's already finished. Then we can finally move back to our own rooms. The track team's training camp should be done as well. They should have come back a week ago. We haven't see them for awhile. Am I done yet? The sun is stronger in the summer. Oh yeah? Alright. Mizuki. Why did you came back? Eh? You went to the track team's training camp, right? Why did you come back? Because... This is all I have left. Please. It's okay if you don't wanna say. Are you moving back? Yeah. I heard they've already fixed the water pipes. Please tell Sano for me. Can you stay here... for a little longer? Can't you? No problem. I was planning on moving back. But since you've asked. Then I'll stay here with you. Not because I want to~ Sano. Don't you think it's time to go back? One more. He still can't make it... That was pathetic! GEH! Kagurazaka. I came to see Sano Izumi's high jump, but that's the worst you can do? You shouldn't be so cruel to a guy who's working hard. The aptitude of my legs is perfect, unlike yours. I could make it at this level without the run-up. You better do your best in the preliminary round. What was that? Annoying Asshole. Aptitude of legs... When I'm jumping... Is there any difference between now and before? You lifted your legs higher before, I think? So that's what he meant. Hmm? He's saying... When I arch my back, I don't force my head as far as possible. Eh? If I make sure my head is down, I'll lift my legs high naturally. So I can easily make it with short run up. That's what he meant. Aren't you done? Excuse me... Let me ask you... Do you think it's possible for people to progress from friends to lovers? Hmm... I think so. For Mizuki... Is there someone that... you care about? Yeah... Is that someone... close to you? Yeah... So... you love that person? No. I see. But sometimes you don't realize it, because you're close to that person. Is that right...? Yes! That's definitely it! That must be right! Nakatsu... Ah? Too close. I'm sorry. I wonder if Sano finished practice...? Oh. He should be back about now. Toilet. I can't! The person that Mizuki cares about... It's me... What should I do? No. No. No. Wait a minute. I'm a guy and he's a guy. That's impossible. But if Mizuki really likes me, I have no reason to refuse. Because love is unconditional. But... assuming that me and Mizuki fall in love, get married and have kids... We'll have to both attend our children's school meetings. Looking at it from our children's viewpoint... We won't even know who's the father and who's the mother... We can't possibly have kids... "Nakatsu-san. Can we get together tomorrow? -Komari" "Komari" Oh! Long time no see. Ashiya? Ah. Toilet. He's really taking his time. "Health Room" Good morning~ This place is not an economy hotel. Nor a 24 hour manga and internet cafe. I got it... you're a little heavy... Also not a "Sano Izumi Strategy Headquarters." Mizuki never returned last night. Something happened at the training camp? No. Then how come he didn't come back? How would I know? He was obviously happy for you when you joined the training camp. It's weird that he's acting like this. Then it should have nothing to do with me. Here. Excuse me. I see. So that's why you left the camp without saying a word. If I... hadn't forced Sano to do the high jump again... He wouldn't have had to suffer the pain and setback of not being able to jump. I thought if I could get into this school... I could make Sano seriously consider the high jump again. That as soon as he started high jumping, he could make it, if he wanted to... You're an airhead champion who gives up on a whim. Do you really think that way? Why do you think Sano knelt down that time? Eh? That's because he wanted to jump. Sano really wants to find himself again, through jumping. It certainly will be painful. But right now, Sano really means business. Sakura Committee? Yeah. Three former dorm leaders teamed up to form the "Sakura Committee". To oppose the school and the parents. This is sort of like a student council. For the three dorm leaders to team up... -That's impossible! -That's impossible! -That's impossible! Right now it really sounds like a fairy tale, right? Hey! Hey! I already told you not to walk ahead of me! It bothers me to see Tennouji-kun suffering from the summer heat. You're the one who is suffering! You both are suffering! What did you say?! I'm saying this is our last chance in high school to enjoy the summer. But you guys only want to wage an idiotic war like this. Right! Right! You're the most idiotic one! You failed all the subjects in the last final exam, right? Shut up! You bastard! Where did this came from? Osaka Sports? Find the treasures that's hidden deep within Osaka High. This was said by principal herself. From Hawaii?? That means Director Sawatari is in Hawaii. So there are treasures in the school somewhere? REALLY?! Can it be Tokugawa's buried gold? Could it be stocks? Could it be cash? A Hotspring? Aright! Let's go on a treasure hunt to find the hidden treasures! Hi! Mizuki! Mama?? How have you been? Papa!? Hanazakari no Kimitachi e ~ikemen paradise~ Episode Six Translator: Kai200X You really look like a small boy. Are you changing your image? I guess so... Why are you here all of a sudden? Honeymoon, of course. What do you mean of course... even now? Hmm~ What? We always feel like newlyweds. Right? Papa? Stop fooling around. Your father, one day he suddenly said... I'm really worried about Mizuki. I'm not worried about her. We already booked a family suite for tonight. Why don't you stay with us? Eh? Might as well. That way, I won't have to go back to the dormitory. Yeah. Okay. You look sleepy. Yeah... I didn't sleep well. Nakatsu... Mizuki?! What? Boyfriend? Let's introdu... No. No. No. No. Hello! Hello! What's the problem? Hello! Where did you go last night? I was worried sick. Sorry... Komari-chan. We're on a date. Be quiet. Komari. No... It's not what you think... Because she wants to talk to me... It's okay. It's okay. It's not okay! Why are you angry? Oh yeah, I'm gonna stay with my parents tonight. Please tell Nanba-senpai for me. Nakatsu is a super nice guy. Yes. Later. Hey. Can we really find the treasures with this thing? Idiot! These are Dowsing Rods. During the Edo period. There was a preacher from Holland named Dowsing. He invented these after days and nights without sleep... because he wanted to use them to find his lost son. That was so sad... Dowsing Rods during the Edo period? It must be fake... AH~! Over there~! Dig out whatever's underneath this statue! Yes! The treasures are not necessary made of metal, right? Of course the treasures are made of metal. Didn't We learn that from our elementary textbooks? Oh yeah? Pardon me. Oh! Nakatsu! You're back just in time. We're doing a Treasure Hunt. Nakatsu! Come and help us! I'm not gonna help! This metal detector is not working at all. In that case. You can just use this guy as a detector. Idiots! Bunch of idiots! Why didn't I think of that? Those foolish humans wasting their time walking around. Submit yourself under our intelligence! OK! Come! It seems that he has been possessed again... Done. OH~! We have no idea! Limbo? Limbo dance. Is that the hint we need? Limbo's good! Let's go prepare it for me. Yes! Oh! It's rare to see you here around this time. I just came to change my t-shirt. You were sweating bullets! I met Mizuki awhile ago. His parents are in town right now. Tonight he'll stay with them in a hotel. I see. Still... Something did happen, huh? I disappointed him. He went out of his way to come see me... but I couldn't make it. So... I don't think Mizuki is avoiding you just for that. There must be another reason. Even so. Right now all I can do is jump. This dress looks good. Right? It looks good. Isn't it too girlish? You're a girl, so it doesn't matter. That's true... Go try this on. Eh? Excuse me! She would like to try this on. Mizuki. Hmm? Are you hiding something from us? Eh? What? Do you think that your mother isn't for real? I can tell just by looking at your face. Is there someone that you like? That is not true. It's not like that. Being this serious makes it even more suspicious. How should I say it? It's hard to explain... It's a confused feeling... I think that is love. I already told you... "Nakatsu Shuichi" Hello? Are you available in awhile? In awhile? Go ahead. Just remember be back before dinner. OK? Oh. I got it. Oh. Here! Here! Inspect this spot thoroughly! As you wish! Let's dance! There's a yellow aura. I found it. We found the treasure! What~ the hell?! What is it? Is it cash? Looks like three separate pieces of paper with hints written on them... Wa-Wait! You guys can't look! We're the one who found it. A sage... sleeps in the forest. See his lips. Idiot! They can hear you if you read it out loud. A sage sleeps in the forest... Someplace with graves or statues. Statue?! Statue? Weren't we just there not long ago? Alright. Everyone! Let's get going! Yes! Next is... Nakao... "Look into the center of the water drop paradise" Ha! You guys go look for it near the pond. Yo! Oh. I'm such a nice guy. I even surprised myself. It look like we're victims of Nakatsu's scheme. Oh. You. Why did you leave without saying a word? No... Because... That's because... You thought I was hurting because I knelt down? Yeah, a little... No, a lot... Are you stupid? Do not be mistaken. I didn't start jumping because of you. You're still full of yourself just like before. Do you think the world revolves around you? But... Umm... I'm just saying... That's who you are... You don't have to say that! Eh? I got very depressed. I feel that I made you suffer. Why do you have to be depressed? That's odd. You always do whatever you like. Now you got depressed for no reason. Seriously, you're a very busy person. What? You grow your hair just like Kitaro. I looked like Kitaro? Then you must be my Eyeball Father (Medama Oyaji) Eyeball Father? Yeah! You're always eyeballing me, so it's appropriate! Later! Father! Hey! Wait a minute! Kitaro! Hey! Kitaro! What's up with those two? I called her Eyeball Father, is it too much...? Where are the treasures? Where is it? Where is it? A sage sleep in the forest... then what? A sage sleeps in the forest, see his lips. L-i-p-s. AH! Lips! I got it! OK! Good job. Oscar. We keep searching everywhere thats related to water. So far we just can't find it anywhere. That is weird. Water. Water. Water. Water. Water. Water... 100 yen. Oscar... Who's the moron that pushed me?! That. We got it. We got it. Nanba-senpai! Huh? Dorm 1 and Dorm 3 they've both found the pink envelope already. What? We're the only one who haven't found anything? Senpai. We still have one more paper left. You don't have to tell me! What is the last clue? "Look over there" Look over where? Here. Here. Look over here. - Idiot. - It hurts. This clue is way too short. How can we figure it out? I'm hungry. What is this? Where is my bread? Wait... Where's my bread? Where's my bread?? Where's my bread?! AH! The lobster is delicious! What's wrong? Didn't you meet with your boyfriend? Boyfriend? I've already told you it's not like that... Hmm... But your face looks very tired. How can I let you stay in Japan by yourself? Why don't you return to America? Eh? Let's go back. I thought there was something you had to do? That's what you told me when you ran away from home. There's something I must do! Please trust me. Have you taken care of everything? About that... You haven't finished anything. You already want to go back? I don't remember that being how I brought you up. Why did you set me up to meet with Sano? Ah. Impulse? What do you mean impulse? Sorry. Sorry. I'm just kidding. Personally, I just have to help out my friends when they're in need. Seriously. Even though I don't know what your beef with Sano is. But you must be thinking too much. Eh? No, how to say this... You usually say one thing and he says another, then you'll start fighting. I've never seen Sano treat anybody like that, other then you. In other words, he opens himself up when he's with you. No... Of course I mean like a friend. A friend! I understand. I probably shouldn't say this. But it's really not that big of a deal. So, hurry up and go back to bed. Oh. Nakatsu. Oh? Thank you. AH~ The feeling is not the same without jumping after all. Hey. Stay out of here during summer vacation. Why is that? Don't play dumb. Listen. Listen carefully. If the publisher approves Sano's pictures. Don't you ever, ever appear in this school ever again. I've already let you use my X-ray room as your darkroom. But if Sano-kun can't make the jump... You think I'd say 'Oh Yeah! Sano will make the jump'? You idiot. Listen. Whether Sano can make the jump or not, is up to himself. This will be key to determining if my return as a professional camerawomen is a success or not! Because of that, I MUST photograph him doing his jump! Look at this. The wind messed you up. Can't you make me look cute? You came here for Sano Izumi-kun, right? Eh? Your mama is a "know it all." Do you love Sano-kun? I've already told you it's not like that. Mizuki. Falling in love is not necessary a bad thing. Your mama. Before when I'd see a lobster, it used to make me so sick, I couldn't eat it. Eh? You obviously enjoyed it yesterday. Yeah. One day, your papa, recommended that I eat it. So I tried it and it was so delicious. I felt like I'd already wasted half of my life. Mama is exaggerating. Absolutely not. Because I realized, encountering something unexpected can be a wonderful thing. Encountering something unexpected? Yeah. Trying on a skirt I didn't like. Some would say it looked good. Went to a horror movie I thought I'd be scared of. It turned out to be fun. People understand things better after they first experience them. Someone you originally thought you didn't love. But suddenly you realize you actually do love that person. Love will make people more mature. If Mizuki can also meet someone like your papa, that will be great. Even though he's stubborn sometimes. But now he's a good papa who wishes happiness upon Mizuki more than anyone. Ehm. Papa. Hm? I... I'm gonna stay here and try again for awhile longer. I'm sorry I ran away like that. I know because of me. You guys are really worried about me. But... You're able to tolerate my selfishness. I'm really grateful to you, papa. I... When Sano can high jump again... I'll return to America. You... just keep believing in the path you chose for yourself. You... will have our support. So... As long as you do can do it then... go for it! Papa... Be careful on the road. Mizuki too. Send my regard to your boyfriend. EH? Boyfriend? I already told you it's not like that! Papa, hurry up! If we don't hurry we won't make it! Drive away, please~! Hey! I haven't approved of your boyfriend yet~ Hey~ See you! Bye! Mizuki! See you~ What the hell is H, I? Absolutely no idea... Romaji pronounced Heh. English pronounced Hi. It could be initial. Initial... hmm... Could be some kinda abbreviation? Kinda like... Awful smell (Hidoi Ishuu)? Brown bear & weasel! (Hikumo Itachi) Oh! Still don't understand. What kinda hints did the other dorms get? Wh-What was the hint... that was written on Dorm 1's card? Who's gonna tell you that? Go ask that... shameless individual! You rascal! Who are you calling shameless? It's impossible for me to tell you anything! If we keep this up then we will never solve anything! How about you two give me your cards, then maybe... I'll have no problem sharing some of the treasures with you guys. No problem! Who's gonna give it to you? Correct. Instead of giving it to you, I might as well eat it. Oh! Mizuki. Welcome back. What are they doing? Treasure hunt. Huh? Treasure hunt? What is that you're holding? This? This was stuck into our dormitory's door. AH~! This... Where have I... seen something like this before? Osaka Sports! "One for all, All for one"... What does that mean? I'll serve everyone, Everyone will serve me. Ah~ So that means...? It means everyone should work together as a team. Throw away your stupid egos. Everyone join forces, then you can find the answer, right? Don't make me laugh! I don't want to work with these guys... This is my line. Join forces? Impossible! This! Was said by principal herself. I guess it can't be helped. Hibari?? Has anyone here, been pursued by many people before? No. Has it happened to Hibari-sama before? Of course. Really? In order to have many people affected by your charms. You have to keep releasing your pheromones at all times. Will they come out? Be quiet! Komari! But... Hibari-sama! What?! What's happening?? Wait! Don't do that! Don't touch me! Sano-sama! Not there! Wait! I got it~! Komari. Did you see that? Yes. She was pursued by many people. I'm such a... sinful woman. Is he thinking about jumping? Not sure... He usually waits until everyone's finished practicing then he jumps. We got it! Let's see! Open it. C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! "The treasures are inside of me." What are the treasures anyway? What are they? This face... It appears as though we had seen it somewhere before... Ah! That! Oh~ That. First principal - Edward J. Harrison. Now we know. Then, what does it mean by "inside of me"? Hey. If you want to jump then hurry up. I want to make him high jump again. Make him smile again! This place has a vault. My heart is beating so fast. Tokugawa's buried gold. Stock! Cash! A hot spring... it can't be. What is that? How come student uniforms? Could that be... If three Dorm Leaders don't join forces, then our school will have no future. Hopefully, through this organization, the "Sakura Committee", you three will wear these uniforms and represent the students, overcome all obstacles and come out on top. Bring back the Sakura Committee? What should we do? Are you in? No objection! Me too. That's final. OK! I'll lead the Sakura Committee! OK! Hey! What are you talking about? No! I'm the one who's most capable, if we get right down to it, right? No. No. No. No. It will have to be me. I've already said I'll lead! Let me do it! Me! Me! Me! I'll do it. No. I'll do it! I can't let someone from Dorm 2 win this thing. You people from Dorm 1 better shut up. We'll lead it even if we have to fight! What's up? Not sure what's up... Oh! Sekiguchi! Long time no see. I'm Sekime! I got huge news! Sano made the jump. Eh? For real? Ehm. Even though it's only district rally standard. But he still made the jump very beautifully. The other members have also accepted Sano back on the team. I'm so glad! Mizuki! Seriously. You're slow. It's not about that! How come you didn't tell me you were going to jump beforehand? Is it true that you made the jump? That didn't count. What? I don't get it? You made it, right? Maybe. Are you kidding me? Why didn't you tell me beforehand? I just told you. It's still far from my usual standard. I don't get it! You really don't want me to see you jump? Yeah. That's because, I want you to see me jump on the official stage. Eh? So... I didn't want you to see it yet. Sano... Hey. What's wrong? I'm just glad... Where did Mizuki go... I finally realize... My feeling toward Sano is... Love. *Thank You For Watching* Timings by Kai200X / tianj Edited by Kai200X / Wwaldo37 Translated by Kai200X I'm going back to America. You don't care if you never see Mizuki again?
