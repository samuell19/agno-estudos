Okay, I know we're covering a lot in this section, and we'll have to jump over several chapters before the end of term. So, we'll focus on psychosocial development beginning in puberty through gravity, lactation, menopause and senescence. Even though this class isn't exactly my speciality, the subject is tangentially related. I can't go into it fully in the classroom setting, but... I'm primarily concerned with the modern codification and demystification through scientific and rational parallels of the twilight language of Black Magic. Occult images and symbols that serve a dual and unified purpose to both hide and reveal. Obscuring truth from those who do not know and revealing truths to those who are initiated. The alchemical Magnum Opus, the Philosopher's Stone, turning lead to gold, and base matter to might. Nature from nature. The dismemberment and re-memberment of physical memory: a transcendent mode of being beyond matter. Do you understand? - I think it's Ellie. She's here. - Yeah. I'll get it. I'll get it. Here. This is rubbish. Okay. Mom... what are you doing here? What... what's going on? Who's that? Hi, Ellie. It's Shirley. Do you remember me? How are you feeling? She's great. I'm fine... great. We haven't seen you in so long, love. And you're doing so well out there in the world... - Can we please just... - Yep. Come on. Come in. We loved hearing about your baby, and your book, and your engagement... Thanks, Shirley. We were just talking about your book and your job... - Yeah. - We're so happy for you. - I... - Thank you so much. Really helpful. Yeah. No. All good. I'll, um, I'll leave you both to it, to catch up. Yeah. So, I'll, um... - Must be so lovely to see each other after so long. - I'll give you... I'll give a ring when we've got settled here. - Okay. All good. - Yeah? - Nice to see you, Ellie. - Bye. You did... hey, did you know that Gus is here? He's working on the... on the house. Were you carrying these pregnant? I told you, I'm still working on that book. So, it's not finished then? I'm almost done. Ah, I'm just copying some notes from my lectures. Revisions, whatever. I just wanted to make a few last-minute changes. But... it's basically done. It's been a long process this book, for you. Hasn't it? Well, I was going to get it done with some peace and quiet. I told you that there was work being done on the house. - This is not quiet. - Just give me the house key. - Please. - You need to hydrate after all of that travel. Airplanes dry you out. But it's good you finally got away from that fiancée of yours. He was an abusive man. Why do you insist on selling this place now? Your grandparents are barely cold, and I have to salvage everything I can, and look after your father. Dad is here? I need to be here, too. I'm the executor of the will and... it's not just the funeral, and overseeing the house renovations, it's also all of the sorting, the packing, and then all of it being cleared out. So, you can have a good house appraisal on Monday. Will you please let me stay? I really wasn't expecting you to be here. I promise to stay out of your hair. You won't even notice me. In fact, I'll go into town right now and get you a key cut. Ooh. Ellie, call this number if your father has an attack. Just be careful not to agitate him. I'll go and get the key and... you can just settle in. Ellie? Ellie? Ellie? What happened? I got dizzy. You should rest. Where are you going? Well, you need to lay down. - I made up your bed in your old room. - I can walk. Can you get me my purse, Mom? I need to take my baby vitamins. I'm fine. Ellie? Ellie? Ellie?! Is baby kicking? Thanks, Mom. So, do you want to stay in the guest room? I do understand. This was my bedroom. No. This is not your bedroom. This is the guest room. But it's okay if you forgot. You never had a great memory. It's fine. Here you go. - Well, how is the baby? - Mom, you need to ask. You can't just go grabbing at me... I can't just touch my own daughter? I'm sorry. I'm turning your bedroom at home into a nursery, and I'd love to know if I should paint it blue or pink. - Do you know if it's a boy or a girl? - Mom... No. I'm not doing ultrasounds. Well, don't you want to know if it's deformed or retarded or... The baby is fine, Mom. I'm fine. Everything is fine. I could paint it beige. I'm just excited for you. You're so lucky. I could never get pregnant. You had me... Oh, besides you, of course. What's wrong? You're really jumpy. You did this... like that. I'm fine. I just want to know that you're taking care of yourself and the baby. Have you done any tests? Have you gone through your medical history? I'm trying to do this naturally. Doctors are part of the problem. I'll be back. Ha. It's a good look on you, Ivy. Gus, could you maybe take the rest of the day off? Yeah. We talked about that. I've got another job starts next week. Ellie just got here. She's really tired. She's not feeling well. I think she's napping. Can you just get her a motel? I'd love to. She is insisting on being here. I've got a lot of work to do and I can't make up for lost time. I know it's a pain. Please. Come on. You can find something to do. All right. Just let me know when I can get inside. Sure. The concept of linear time is entirely modern. Linear time, progress, history; they all arise from the influence of human will on natural seasonal events. Once humans began to exert force through technology, fire, agriculture, tools, they observed the uniquely effectual transformation of nature. This effect depends on the transmutation of the elements; turning wood to fire, for example. And the speeding up of natural, organic and biological processes of divinely engendered slow change, altering, in effect, the flow of time itself... What's your book about? Ah, it's an academic survey of the origins of modern science in the Middle Ages. How postclassical Europe developed empiricism and experimental science... Sounds interesting. Oh... Shirley dropped that. Such a shame. Ellie... Ellie... Can I have it? And to this day, these same goals are pursued, turning lead to gold, the extension of life, the creation of life from matter. The commercial goals of modern science, the Magnum Opus of ancient alchemy, the Black Arts of the Black Land. Khemet. And this involved memory techniques as well. - The use of memory to alter time. - Ellie? I was just wondering if... Sacred time endlessly repeats, while historical progress, linear time... bisects the circle. Time itself is a hierophany... A revelation of the divine. We observe nature, the structure of creation as the mind of God revealed to us over the course of time. We change and alter this structure through our human will. This is evidence of man's divine nature... I experience a deep sense of peace in all situations. I experience a deep sense of peace in all situations. Ellie? Hormones. It's just the baby. It puts pressure on my cervix. I need to ambulate my hip flexors. I'm seeing Cara. - You're gonna be okay. - Mm-hmm. What am I saying? You are okay. It was just my imagination. It wasn't real. No. It's not real. I'm sure it feels real and terrifying. It's just your imagination playing tricks. And I think it's probably to do with coming off your meds. All right? So, there's nobody here. I'm just gonna go and get you some dry clothes. Ellie... ...you're perfectly safe. It's an heirloom. Careful... You know how valuable it is? One day it'll be yours. What about Cara? Oh, don't worry about that, darling. She's not really a Maybrick. Look what I found. When you get scared, you just ring that, and I'll be right there. All right? Why did you want to come back here? I don't know. I just... ...wanted to see the place one last time before we sold it Have you seen that old broken vase? When you were packing? The one that Cara broke? You're not sentimental... Ellie. We need to focus on happy memories. Hmm? I found something earlier, and I want you to see it. Ellie? What are you doing? Nothing. I want to show you this. I think you need to watch something happy. ♪ Last night I lay sleeping ♪ There came a dream so fair ♪ I stood in old Jerusalem ♪ Beside the temple there ♪ I heard the child ...and ever... Closer. Look at me. Smile. Morning, Miss Maybrick. Closer. Look at me. Stand still. Smile. Look at Grandma. They really didn't like being recorded. That was a beautiful summer. And look at you smiling. It was so lovely. Do you remember that? Not really. But you can see how you were, right? Do you remember any of the good times? Look how young and strong your father was. Are you seeing this, Jack? It's quite shocking what's happened to both of you. So that's when he was being inducted. It's quite rare for a surgeon to get the Order of Merit. - Ah, this is the picnic... - Was I sick much... as a child? I've been really looking forward to you coming home. I want to try and make this work, Ellie. For you. For the baby. I want us to have a good relationship, be a real family. Hmm? How are you feeling about having the baby? The baby? Good. I'm... I'm, ah, happy. I'm excited what she's going to be like and... She? You told me that you didn't know. I had a dream. I think I'm having a little girl. Mmm. Did you... dream about me before I was born? Ellie, come over here. All the time. Cara. Oh God. Turn that off. That was a dumb idea. The... tapes are getting old and worn out. Okay? Are you okay? Yeah. I'm gonna finish packing upstairs. No. No. Dad... Mom, can I pick flowers? ...In old Jerusalem Beside the temple there... I heard the children singing And ever as they sang... Me thought the voice of angels From Heaven in answer rang - Me thought the voice of angels - Please stop! - From Heaven in answer rang - Cara, stop! Ah, stop it! - Jerusalem... - Cara... Stop! Dad, do you need something? Imperfect! Hosanna to your King! Cara. Come in. Can you feel anything? Do you understand me? You're incredible. How could this happen? My child! My child... She's... Ellie, you were a child. The whole family changed when we adopted Cara. You know your father was not a good person, and we just had to accept his activities. But God knows how many children he produced, ones we don't even know about. It's family, and I tried to keep the family together. Don't torture yourself. What's done is done. We're gonna make a better family. Hmm? All right then. There you go. See. All right. Remember that smell? Bring back memories? If you could get his feet. Are you good? All right. And one... two... three. Oh God! Ellie, can you get the brakes? - I'm... - All right. Have you done that? It's... it's stuck. Oh my God. Ellie! - Do you, ah, do you... the side. You... - I'm trying. It's stuck. - I thought you were getting the brakes. - Ah, I'm trying. It's stuck. Can you get the wheelchair? - Ellie, can you get the wheelchair? - I can't leave the bed. Oh God. All right. I think I'm gonna go and get Gus. You'd be all right with that? You got him? Ellie? Mom, are you still there? Give it to me. All right. Here we go. Yep. Ivy said you're sick. Ah, I said she wasn't feeling well. When you weren't feeling well this morning. You're a carpenter? I have an architectural restoration company. But yeah. I'm a carpenter. Are you gonna fix the stair bannister? You know it's loose, Mom? Ah. He's doing inside stuff later. Ellie is pregnant. Wow. That's great. That's good, right? Why don't I show you the bannister now? Ellie, do you think you could... feed your dad? Probably needs some friends. Oh, that's sweet of you, Gus. ...especially after how she handled your breakup. I mean, I know it was ages ago but I wish she'd been kinder. She's so touchy if I've said anything. She's come off her medications again. So, she really can't be upset right now. I'm afraid she's gonna get violent again. She attacked her fiancée... you know, he was... ...cheating on her, and she completely lost it. Oh, I'm not desperate. I'm just trying to be friendly and there's no harm in that. No. Sure. Sure. Why did she break up with me? God only knows, Gus. She's erratic. It's good that you're looking after her. Look what I found. Can I have it, please? Please... ...Ellie. Ellie... What have you done? Looks like he's making a break for it. What in the world? Jack, get away from there! All right. How did that happen? You let him fall out of... I don't know. I had to go to the bathroom and then he was there. - Just get his legs up. - Yep. He's all right. Oh, thanks, Gus. So, are you gonna finish up outside, Gus? - Nah, I'm... I'm done. - Do you want to stay for dinner? Have you seen the state of the kitchen? What are you thinking, Ellie? Sorry, Gus. What are you doing back here? I don't know. I had to... get away to finish a book. I thought about moving to the States... New England... work on those colonial houses. You like it? It's a job. You're writing a book? It's academic. It's a... survey on the origins of modern science in the Middle Ages. How experimental science grew out of magical thinking. Wow. So, you're still into all that stuff? You remember? Ah... Ah, I was always into... science and... It's... it's history. It's a specific period in the history of... science and... I like history. Good to see you. You were making him uncomfortable. What's going on? - I don't know. Nothing. - Can you read basic social signals? Nonverbal communication? I know he's not high class, and I'm sure he likes you. But God, Ellie, give him some credit. Mom, why...? Did I look stupid? He's a lady's man about town. That... that's okay. Did I say something? Did I look stupid? He said he couldn't even tell you were pregnant. Why do you lock it? Why do you lock the doors? Because it's organized. Are you still seeing Cara? You need to stop that. We'll have some ground rules, okay? Some basic rules. You stop talking about dark stuff. One. Two, you let me take care of you. Three, be normal. Four, I don't know. Just don't get excited. Okay, Mom. I won't. I'm okay. I'm stressed out, too. It's really difficult being here. We've got to keep ourselves together. Just keep telling yourself that you're okay. Now, go to bed. Have you got your bell? These experiments are conducted with intention at the molecular level. The cells divide with intention and develop into consciousness, reflecting the gaze of the observer. Neurobiologically, we have evidence memory is encoded in DNA and passed epigenetically to offspring. A form of physiological mnemonic time travel encoded in the body. I can't go into it fully in the classroom setting, but... I'm primarily concerned with the modern codification and demystification through scientific and rational parallels of the twilight language of Black Magic. The alchemical Magnum Opus of transmutation... turning lead to gold, the refinement of metals, and turning base matter to mind? Nature from nature, and the creation of energy from matter, the extension of life, the Philosopher's Stone, occult images and symbols that serve a dual and unified purpose, to both hide and reveal. Images that obscure a truth from those who do not know and reveal truths to those who are initiated. The torturous process of fully dissecting and reassembling their victim... ...Do you understand? It's not real. It's not real. Are you okay, Mom? Yes. Wonderful. There is a girl in Dad's office. Go in. It's okay. Go ahead, sweetie. Welcome home, Cara. This is your home now. Everything is gonna be all right. Does she understand? Thank you, Mrs. Maybrick. Oh. You can call me, "Mommy." Don't be ridiculous. Ellie, come over here. This is Cara... your sister. She's going to living with us from now on. Remember we talked about this? Do you remember? This is your sister, Ellie. I want you to be very... very nice to her. They'll be good together now. Off you go. Stay out of my office. Oh my God. My baby. I'm sorry, Cara. Please don't do this to my baby. I'll find the vase. Cara, I'm sorry. Just please don't do this. Ah! Ah! I experience a deep sense of peace in all situations. I experience a deep sense of peace in all situations. I experience a deep sense of peace in all situations. I got your father fed. I'm making Turkish eggs. Do you want chili on yours? I have some asparagus, too. That has folate in it. It's good for the baby. I don't know what's wrong with me. I should get an ultrasound. Something is wrong, ah... I don't know if I'm doing the right things for my baby. Well, you've been looking after yourself. You've been taking your supplements. Right? Here... Asparagus has folate. It's good for the baby. What if I'm doing something wrong? How did you do it? You were a baby. A wonderful baby, and you turned out wonderful. - I should see a doctor. - Yeah. - A baby doctor? - Yeah. I've actually called the family doctor. I have some kind of black ear wax or something... Well, a woman's body changes... in pregnancy. You need to rest. Your books are giving you stress. Is the baby moving around yet? Can I feel anything? Can't feel anything at the moment. I'll check on you in an hour. Just try and relax. Mom... Are you still there? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Ich entschuldige mich. Ah, I mean, to say, ewige Wiederkehr... Of course. The ancient idea of infinite loops and coils of sacred time spiraling in on themselves in an endless cyclical reliving of the God's sacrificial time... No. Stop it. No! No! Stop it. It's not very dignified, is it? Come on. No! Stop it. The goals of modern science are the... the same Black Arts of ancient days, when time was an endless loop of ritual sacrifice and submission. The artificial extension of life... Open up. You're gonna take your medicine and be around for a very long time. Don't want to. I got Ellie back for you. You should be grateful. A family reunion. Please don't do this. What have you done? It wasn't me! It was Ellie! I... I don't know why she did it! Don't you blame this on Ellie! - That vase was priceless! - Mommy! Stop it! - You worthless... worthless little monster! - No! - You've no idea how valuable it is. - No! - You're gonna pay for this! - Mommy, it wasn't me! You're worthless. You're a worthless little monster. Mom! Clean all of this up. What the hell are you doing? I'm looking for the vase. I've got everything really well organized, Ellie. And I need it to stay that way. You can just go unpacking boxes! Why are you doing this to me? I'm working as fast as I can so that we can get out of this goddam crazy shithole! Your book project is driving you crazy! We need to get out of this place before you completely lose it. I know, Mom. Sorry. I... I want to go, too. All right. I came up because I need you to get your research off the table. I'm gonna count to three, young lady. I'll find it. One! Why are you writing a book about this... weird, dark stuff? I don't know. I find it interesting. Interesting to who? Do you believe in this? Do you think it's real? No. Of course not. Well, thank God for that. Ground rules. Remember? This stuff is not good. These pictures. Stress... it isn't healthy. Nightmares aren't good for you or the baby. You're really impressionable right now. With your hormones, and... I feel responsible... for the baby... ...and you. You're gonna get over this, Ellie. It's just a bump in the road. You just need to believe in yourself. Thanks. Yes. I'm gonna... go to the toilet, and then I'm gonna make some tea. Do you want a hand? I was thinking it's been twelve years. Thirteen years... the last time I was here. Christmas thirteen years ago. Have you seen an old, um, broken crystal vase? When you were helping her pack? It's all glued together. I don't pack boxes; I do architectural restorations. So... Ellie? Are you still in the toilet? Please come back downstairs. It's me, Ivy. I'm upstairs. Is Ellie up there? - Nah. - What is it? Can you both come down and help me with Jack? No. No... No... you... girl fail. You... It's... stop it, Dad. Oh... Cara... Cara... No. No. What is it, Dad? Fail. Cara... Car... No. Cara... Her... - Do you see her? - You fail... You fail... I'm sorry, I don't, ah, I don't understand. - It's okay. - Oh... It's okay, Dad... it's okay. Oh... Do you remember why we broke up? I still think about you... sometimes. That doesn't sound healthy. Tell me about it. Could you come over for dinner later today? - Tonight? - Wouldn't you rather go out? I... I can't leave Mom here with Dad like this. They need me. - I have a lot of stuff to do here actually... - Seven. You don't have to. Only if you want to. Ellie! Can you help me! Mom, what's wrong? What happened? Oh, could you get me some ointment, some salve... burn cream. Just something, Ellie. I burned my hand. Ah... Ah, no don't... no don't make a fuss. It's no big deal. Just don't worry about me. I'm just... ah... I just got dizzy. It's this place. It's making me sick. I don't know how I'm gonna get through everything. I don't know how I'm gonna get it all done. How did you burn your hand? Where were you? What are you doing? Getting dinner ready. I invited Gus over. You think that's a good idea, do you? Why did you break us up when we were teenagers? I didn't break you up. God. You had to leave for school. How, ah... Why do you manage to blame everything on me? I never really made any decisions for myself. Oh, didn't you? Well, now you did. So, why don't I leave you to make dinner of Gus, young lady. And give you some space, so you can be alone, and you won't bother me. Unless of course you need to ring your little bell. I'm trying to be normal. We'll have a dinner, and we can all be normal, and Gus can watch us. You were the one that insisted on coming back here. And then of course, go all crazy, as if that couldn't be predicted. But yes, yeah... Be normal. No one is trying to provoke you. I experience a deep sense of peace in all situations. It's a shame you couldn't make the funeral. I know it was short notice. But... It went done very well. "It was a very satisfying funerary experience." That was what your aunt said. She must have been menstruating. To your book, to Gus, to everything else. Thanks, Mom. I'm not drinking. What are you doing? Cauliflower needs to be steamed not boiled. I'm... I'm going to mash them. What? I always steam them. I taught you to steam. It's okay, Mom. Don't worry. It'll be fine. No. It's already not fine. Ah, just... just let me do this, okay? It's... it's just Gus. It doesn't have to be perfect. Ellie, you need to cancel the dinner. You need to call him and cancel before he leaves his house. - It's okay. - He might have left already. - Calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down. You're boiling the cauliflower. Hi, Gus. It's Ellie. No, wait. Um... I'm sorry. We're gonna have... have to cancel tonight. We're not feeling very well and... I think I need to lie down... Well, we'd just rather hang out when we're all feeling better and... I'll... I'll definitely call you back. Okay. Thanks. That sounded fake. Come here, sweetheart. I don't want to upset you... but I have just found out that your father has been unfaithful. You should know that, because it's a betrayal to me and to you, too. Isn't it? I'm sorry, Mommy. Oh, you must be so hurt... but we can be strong about it, and we can do the grieving process together. I know you love your father, but he's not a good husband to me. Some families are like this. We do the best we can, because family is everything. Could you please leave, Cara? This is a private conversation. Poor girl... it's not her fault. Cara? Dad wants me to show you something. Ellie? Ellie, what are you doing? You're not supposed to touch that. Can I hold it? No! Why did you do that! Jack is gonna kill you! Ellie! What's wrong with you? - What have you done? - It wasn't me! It was Ellie! Don't you blame this on Ellie! Stop! Look what I found. No need for Gus. I broke the vase, Mom. It was me. Cara broke it. You just don't remember. No. I... I broke it and I blamed her. No, you didn't. Cara broke it, and I remember because I was there. No. I was there. If you don't stop this, I'm gonna have to take some drastic action. I'm not a child anymore, Mom. Yes, you are. You're my child, carrying my grandchild. Now come and help me with this. Oh, my God. Cara was better than me. Well, your father certainly thought so. I'm gonna sleep on the couch tonight, in case your father needs anything. Can you bring me down some pillows? And my night stuff. And don't go sleepwalking all over the house. This is just to learn how to behave. I'm almost done, but I'm missing a piece. I don't know where it is. Please let me out. Cara, darling. Please calm down. Yes, Mrs Maybrick. Thank you but... Calm down and we'll let you out. This is just to learn a lesson. I've learned the lesson. But there's only thirteen pieces here. Here... You let her out in an hour. Mom says you have to put the vase back together like it was, or you stay in here all night. Look what I found. Can I have it please? Ellie... Please... - Stop! - Ellie! I need it! - Girls! Stop fighting! - Mrs Maybrick, she took it! Stop! Stop! - Let go! - Stop! Ellie... What have you done? Are you awake? I remember what happened. Oh my God. Here we go again. You made me jealous of her and she was good. She was the perfect child and I... I knew I was being mean but... I wanted you to like me. You pushed her over. Don't you remember? No. Not really. You were using me to get back at Dad! Admit it. What is it that you want from me? The truth! Say the truth! And you blamed me. I believed you, even while it was happening. You were fighting, and it all... it happened so fast. I was trying to help you. You've no idea who your father is, and Cara was everything to him, and I was scared, and I just... I just said it. Aren't you my mother? Aren't you supposed to look after me? Not blame me, then pretend to forgive me for the rest of my life. I've wanted to tell you. I was just so afraid you'd hate me. I was afraid I'd lose you and... and then I wouldn't be able to look after you. I'm so sorry. I'm all alone, Mom. I'm so scared. I can't do this by myself. You're not alone. It's important for us to be a family now. For the baby. Will you get some sleep now? All these sleepless nights. The baby needs it, too. I need a doctor. I know. There's someone coming tomorrow. It's good that you know, after all of these years... I feel so much better. Ellie? You get some rest. We're gonna be okay. I love you. You know that, don't you? You know that, don't you? Let's go. ...There came a dream so fair I stood in old Jerusalem Beside the temple there I heard the children singing And ever as they sang Me thought the voice of angels From Heaven in answer rang Me thought the voice Ellie... Mom! Ah! Holidays are periodic intersections of sacred and mundane time. Circles and lines. Time is a hierophany. - No, no, no. - Time is truth in motion. No, not the vase. It's for Cara. - A revelation of human will as divine co-creators... - No! Mom! Please stop, God! - No! - You know, society only created itself so that it could tell itself its own story. You know that, right? All you kids know about... Ellie, be quiet! You're making a scene! You're so obsessed. ...that can finally tell the story of the flesh. No personal will. No progress. No... no history. No redeeming of time, just this boundless, limitless, immeasurable, infinite, submissive, subservient perpetuation of these... of these goddamn irreducible archetypes and symbolic... symbolic fucking unspeakable events! The so-called golden age. Forcing evolution from minerals to plant to animal and back again. Creatures that obey their creators, lacking any critical thought or selfhood. The de-centered self controlled by the Master through intentional distortions of memory, confusion and disaster! - Black magic, the control of the broken mind! - I can't... Do you understand? Stop it. Calm down. - You're being difficult. - Let me out! I need to keep you safe in there. Let me out, please! You're not in control of yourself. Dad! What is happening? Oh my God! Ellie! What's wrong with you? You're making everything difficult. - You're making the baby sick with the stress. - Ah! Let me out! - I'm gonna keep you in there until the doctor comes. - I won't do anything! - Please! - Just stay calm! Think about the baby! I am thinking about my baby! Stop screaming! You're getting too excited! I know you're not feeling well. I know you're scared. I'm scared, too. This has gotten completely out of control. You're gonna hurt yourself. Ellie, this has gone completely out of control. You're not supposed to be in here, Ellie. I'm trying to clean up this mess, and I'm trying to take care of you. We're going to get through this. We're almost done. We're having a baby, a real live baby. But you're reacting strangely to the pregnancy, and something is wrong. You're really scaring me. Am I dying? - Help me. - You're falling apart. Your body and your brain aren't holding together. We never thought you could actually conceive. It should have been impossible. It should have been impossible. We never thought you could actually conceive. - It should have been impossible. - Cara... I didn't want you to see any of this. I never wanted you to know. I... I'm not crazy. No! You never had a great memory. Imperfect! You're so lucky. I could never get pregnant. God knows how many children he produced, ones we don't even know about. Have you gone through your medical history? ...Trying to do this naturally. Doctors are part of the problem. Are you okay, Mom? Yes. Wonderful. There's a girl in Dad's office. What the hell? Ivy?
