Turn on the stereo. I think it's track seven. Fast-forward it. A bit more. That's it. That will calm him a bit. Dad, I don't think he can hear this. He can hear the lowest tones. Rest assured that he can. You don't think you listened to music in your mother's belly? Make it a bit louder. It's such a complex composition, but he makes it sound so easy. Who is playing? Are you serious? Who is it? Rafael Ben-Ari? Is there anyone else who plays like that? Come on, Dror, even Anat recognizes it. How are you? Is he anxious to get out? A bit more. Push. You are doing great. That's it, he's out. He's out. Anati, he's out. Everything is okay. That's it, sweetie. Anati. -Hey -Hey. I'm leaving. Where is Dad? Amazing. He had to go to a meeting at the conservatory. He bought you this. So? Have you seen him? Is it okay for him to be here while you're sleeping? Yes, I want him with me. Okay. Do you need anything else? -No, thanks. -Okay. Ciao. Anat. We have tested him several times. But we did all the tests, even genetic screening. Everything was in order. Yes, I know. You did everything you could. There are things we still can't see before birth. He will get over it, right? I can't say if his hearing will return. We will have to keep an eye on him. Where is your husband? He's landing tomorrow. Anat. Hello. -We came for our release. -I need your papers, please. Do you want to save the wrist bands? We will keep them. That's it, you're released. Thank you. My beauty. What happened? I spoke with the doctor again before they released us. She told us to come back for a follow-up in a month. Did you tell anyone? Stop. Are you okay? Yes. -Do you want to go back to the hospital? -No. Home. Hush. Where were you? I signed us up for a sign language course. Where were you when he was born? I signed us up to the Silent Speaking Institute. They have a beginners' class starting in a week. I heard a lot of great reviews about it. Can you get dressed later so we can go out? Dror, we will wait for Avrey. Shall we? Let's wait for a few minutes for the godfather's brother. There he is, His Highness. What happened? Did the fans hold you up? Female fans. Gentlemen. Shush. If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget her skill. May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if I do not exalt Jerusalem above my chief joy. It is the seat of the Prophet Elijah May he be remembered forever For your salvation I wait, O Lord I await your deliverance Lord, I observe your commandments Elijah, angel of the Covenant Here is yours before you Stand at my right hand and be close to me I await your deliverance, O Lord Rejoice in your word like one Who finds great treasure Those who love your Torah have great peace And no stumbling block before them Happy are those you choose And bring near to dwell He's responding. What does that mean? Well, he responds to sounds. -Then he can hear? -He can hear really well. Come here, Idan. Tell me. I just want to know where you have hidden the notes. I don't know. Do you already know what you're playing for the concert? Yes. -Do you want to tell me? -No. Tell Grandad what you are going to play. I don't want to. He is playing a Bach prelude. Idani, are you waiting for me in the shower? Idan? Are you hiding, sweetie? Idan? Idan? You need to take a shower now, right? We can't be late. If you make a mistake during the concert, just keep going, all right? All right. Good. Let me... Are you crying? No. Is everything okay? I'm happy. Maybe tomorrow we can call Naomi and schedule a concert? Maybe you can start playing a little again? Get a condom, okay? Put on a condom. Is there anything new there, Joel? Not much. There is a review by Shomar on Rafael Ben-Ari's last concert. "Even playing well-digested pieces, Ben-Ari manages to excite." And it's Shomar. I asked if anything was new. Have you ever seen a positive review by Shomar? I have yet to see one. After all, Arieh, it's Rafael, your legendary student. Even Shomar has his limits. Well, the meat is ready. Idani, bring me a glass. How about a toast? To Dad. -Congratulations on the promotion. -Thank you. It's about time. And to you, Dror. Maybe we will hear a new piece from you. With hands like yours, I wouldn't waste my time. He doesn't waste his time. In the meantime, he is studying how to flip steaks. -Cheers. -Cheers. -Congratulations. -Thank you. How is the meat, Avrey? Okay. It's a bit overdone but otherwise okay. So come on. We have more. -Dror, put another piece on the fire. -No, leave it be. Let him do it. It will be ready for you in a moment. That's okay. Everything is fine, Arieh. Are you sure? Yes. It will take some time before it's ready-- Mine is a bit less well done. I don't mind swapping. So are we going to swap plates? Why not? I really like it well done. How about that? This kid is serious. No kidding. He gets a larger steak. Good. He has to eat a lot so that he could practice. -The evaluation is coming up, right? -Yes. Your mother tells me you're working hard. Very good. Now after his promotion, your grandfather decides who gets accepted. Well then, can we hear a little something? Your grandpa's brothers are visiting Israel and you won't play for them? Come on, Idan. I want to show you something. Wait. Idani, you haven't finished eating. He's finished. Come, sit. Do you know who wrote this? No. Me. I was a bit older than you are now. My mother did not believe that I wrote it. Until her last day, she did not believe me. "How could you have written this and played it without mistakes? You're not capable of that," she told me. Idan, legato. Quiet left hand. Idan, legato. Quiet left hand. Without embellishments. Let him be, Arieh. We want to hear him for a moment. He's sight-reading? Idan, is that really what is written here? But it's also interesting this way. Bravo. Well done. And that's from a first reading. -He's schooling us. -Amazing. Before handing over the keys... Before handing over the keys, I would like to tell you a short story. About 35 years ago, a young man entered my office. He's one of the graduates of our composition program. I don't usually recognize faces, but I remembered him because the scores this student composed made all the teachers in this institute jealous. And everyone knew him. He sat in front of me and I asked him, "How can I help you?" He said, "I would like to start teaching here." "What makes you think we are hiring teachers? We have a surplus of them." He kept looking at me. I then asked him, "What about the symphony you have been working on for the past two years? Here, you won't have time to finish it." Without hesitating, he told me, "It's not good enough." "You're hired." People ask me how is it that so many success stories came out of this institute. If they could have seen just how magnificent that piece that this young man put aside was, they would have understood. Someone had to set standards in this place. Now he can keep doing it freely without me getting in his way. What do you always say, Arieh? "There are composers and there are technicians"? Continue to make sure that this institute produces the composers. In just a moment, the valedictorians of our 64th class will come on stage. Congratulations. Thank you, Baruch. -Thank you. -Please. Oh, what a distinguished guest. Do I need to set up these ceremonies just to see you? Just say so and I will arrange one. What are you doing in Israel? Some errands. And where's Dror? He's performing abroad. Well, what would he do here among us old folks? Is he performing something new? No, the same pieces. Now our valedictorians will play -Congratulations. -the concert in A minor -Thank you. -for the departing president of the conservatory, Baruch Gedaliah. -Remind me? -Anat. Go ahead. Rafael? That's my name. I am Arieh Marom's daughter. This is Idan, my son. Arieh Marom... The name sounds familiar, but I don't... We were at your concert just now. And you came to ask for your money back? No. We really enjoyed it. Good. Thanks. Come again. Idan plays all of your works. Mine in particular? Yes. What's your name? Oh, I thought I told you. Anat. Anat. Rafael. Idan. How old are you? Twelve. With whom are you studying? With my teacher, Hillel Spiegler. Are there specific composers that you like, Idan? Yes. Do you want to tell us which? Rafael Ben-Ari, Arthur Cohen, Bach, Debussy, and Chopin. Slower. As if this is the first time you have thought about it. Rafael Ben-Ari, Arthur Cohen, Bach, Debussy, and Chopin. And which work have you chosen to play? "Jardins sous la Pluie" by Debussy. "Jardins sous la Pluie." "Jardins sous la Pluie." "Sous la Pluie." "Sous la Pluie." And which work have you chosen to play, Idan? "Jardins sous la Pluie" by Debussy. Great. In any case, put on the white shirt. Hello? -Have I reached the Tal family? -Yes. This is Yariv from the Silent Speaking Institute. You have registered with us in the past for a course, and I wanted to invite you to our open day so you can get to know our middle school-- I don't understand. You've called in the past, and we said we're not interested. I understand. This year, we are offering a substantial reduction for past participants. It's not relevant to us. Thank you. You're Arieh's daughter, right? Yes. Well, then here's the form. You mark here that you want the three-year program for young composers. Yes? Fill in all the details here. The first round is today. For those who will pass, the second round of evaluation is in six weeks, and for that round, an original piece must be prepared. The result will be sent in the mail. In just a few minutes, you will go in. All right? By the way, are you still performing? You're Idan? And you're the mother? I didn't know there would be such a respectable representative of the Marom family. Not exactly the Marom family anymore. Fine. But you can see the similarities. What will you play for us? "Jardins sous la Pluie" by Debussy. Go ahead. Okay, Idan. That's fine. Who taught you how to play like that? My teacher, Hillel Spiegler. Nice. Idan, do you maybe have a piece that you wrote? There is, but it is not finished yet. Let's hear what you have there. Yes. He hasn't practiced it enough. That's fine. Let's hear it. It's for the second round. That is what I have in the meantime. You wrote that by yourself? Yes. Very good. FATHER'S SIGNATURE: HANAN TAL ANNUAL SCHOOL TRIP PERMISSION SLIP How old is he? Twelve. I don't think I would change anything. It's beautiful as it is. When will he play it? On Tuesday, for the end-of-year concert. And then for the evaluation. Do you really think it's good? Yes. What? I don't know. I think I should go now. Okay. Thank you. Why didn't you tell me about the permission slip? What? What permission slip? The permission slip for the school trip that you signed. I didn't sign any permission slip. Where were you? He must have signed it himself. -Where did you find it? -On his desk. He usually hides these things in his bottom drawer. -When is the trip? -Hanan, he can't go on this trip. The date is too close to the evaluation day. But sweetie, he hasn't received the result yet. And a two-day school trip -will make a difference? -Yes! Anati. I don't want to talk about it anymore. Where were you so late at night? Enough. TAL FAMILY TO: ANAT AND HANAN TAL SILENT SPEAKING INSTITUTE SIGN LANGUAGE TEACHING CENTER OPEN DAY DO YOU KNOW OUR SCHOOL? May I come in? HOW CAN I HELP YOU? I want you to remove me from your distribution list, please. YOU CAME HERE JUST FOR THAT? THIS COULD BE DONE OVER THE PHONE. I have tried. Anat Tal. YOU REMIND ME OF SOMEONE WHO STUDIES HERE. YOU LIVE AT 9 MISHKAN SHILOH STREET? Yes. I LIVE AT NUMBER 5. WE'RE NEIGHBORS. YOU WON'T BE BOTHERED ANYMORE. Thank you. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? Yes, thank you. I'M HERE IF YOU WANT TO ASK SOMETHING. I PROMISE NOT TO HEAR ANYTHING. Good -What are you doing? -And... another one. Wow! How? Oh, shit. Come on, it's stuck. Come on. Hanan, did you check if the mail arrived today? No. I will check later. There are four here. Stop for a second. Come here for a moment. Thanks. Enough. Hi, Dad. Am I interrupting? Are you sure? I just wanted to remind you about Idan's concert the day after tomorrow at 8 p.m. He finished writing his piece, so he will play the whole thing. Great. That will really make him happy. I... I will save you a seat. We will save you a seat. Also, do you have a minute? No. And Dad, can I ask something else? I know that you shouldn't deal with it, but we still haven't received the result of the evaluation from the conservatory. Yes, I called, but they said they sent it some time ago in the mail. They said they will send it again, but until it arrives, and... And the second round is in less than two weeks. Maybe there's another option. Is there an option to speed it up a little or get the result by phone? SILENT SPEAKING INSTITUTE SIGN LANGUAGE TEACHING CENTER Excuse me. Can we sit here? No, they're reserved. Sorry. Traffic jams are everywhere. Where is Dad? Hasn't arrived yet. Distinguished guests, I would like to ask for silence, please. We would like to start. We will start the second part of the evening with Idan Tal, 12 years old, with his original work. Idan, please. RAFAEL BEN-ARI You're up. This is the first time I have felt at peace with a composition. I wrote this for you. Where's Idan? He's on the school trip. Hi, this is Anat, Idan's mother. Yes. Have you left already? Idan. Come, sweetie. Get in the car. Come, get in the car. Idan, get in the car. Idan. Idan. I'm sorry it turned out this way. There will be other trips, sweetie. The evaluation only happens once. Idan, look at me. I know you wanted to go. What? Where were you last night? I asked you where you were. Have you lost your mind? You took him out of the school trip? Idan, you don't have to go with your mother. I can take you on the trip. Go get your bag. Hanan, I am driving him on the trip. What? He did not pass the evaluation. The result came today. I will drive him. Let's go, Idan. Where is his bag? In the trunk. Anat? Can we come in? Sure. Come in. Sit down. Can I bring you something to drink? No, nothing. Are you sure? How about you, Idan? Nothing. We wanted to know why Idan didn't pass the first round. Anat, you know how many children come to be evaluated, not just from Israel. But you are the one who decides. Not just me. You know how it works. He did his very best. But not everyone can get in. But he composes. He writes. You have not seen all of his work. For what, Anat? The slots for the second round have already been filled. It's not your fault. Enough. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. You don't need to cry. I will get you something to drink. Come. Sit down. Sit down. Play it. Is it good? Is it good? Have you no shame? Have you no shame? Why are you doing this to him? Is this a composition at all? Is this music? Anat, there are composers, and there are technicians. There are musicians, and there are technicians. There are pianists, and there are technicians. You don't need me to spell it out for you. You know whom he inherited it from. From whom? RAFAEL Idan. Idan. I'm sorry. I got locked out of my house. Yes. YOU CAN STAY HERE. I WILL MAKE A BED FOR YOU. Thank you. Why do you have a piano here? MY DAUGHTER LEARNED TO PLAY. Does she still play? I DON'T KNOW.
