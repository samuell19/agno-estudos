THERE'S ONLY ONE PROPER WAY TO CONDUCT A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE A DOCUMENT WHICH SETS OUT THIS WAY. MR. GRAHAM, WHAT'S THE NAME OF THIS DOCUMENT? THE CONSTITUTION, SIR. YOU MEAN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? YES, SIR. THANKS. THE FBI IS OUR HIGHEST LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. WE DO NOT VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION EVER. QUESTION. WITHIN THE CONSTITUTION, IS THERE A SPECIFIC AMENDMENT THAT PROTECTS AMERICANS FROM UNREASONABLE SEARCH AND SEIZURE? MR. BUTZ. THE FOURTH AMENDMENT ST-- CORRECT. QUESTION. WHAT IS REQUIRED OF A FEDERAL OFFICER BEFORE ISSUING A WARRANT FOR SEARCH OR SEIZURE? MS. DeWITT. UH...SUSPICION? I BEG YOUR PARDON. SUSPICION OF EVIDENCE ON THE PREMISES? HAVE YOU READ MY BOOKS? NOT YET, SIR. SIT DOWN, DeWITT. MS. ZUCKERMAN, CAN YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION? FEDERAL OFFICERS DON'T ISSUE WARRANTS. THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THAT A FEDERAL OFFICER OBTAIN A SEARCH OR SEIZURE WARRANT FROM A FEDERAL JUDGE ONLY AFTER SHOWING CAUSE. THANK YOU. MS. DeWITT, THE FBI ADMITS 40 TRAINEES INTO EACH AGENTS TRAINING PROGRAM. LAST SESSION, NINE GRADUATED. 31 DIDN'T. FOR EVERY TRAINEE THAT BECOMES AN AGENT, THERE ARE THREE OTHERS WHO BECOME ENCYCLOPEDIA SALESPERSONS OR TELEPHONE REPAIRPERSONS OR PERHAPS BEAUTICIANS. DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR? YES, SIR. NOW, ON MY SIGNAL, YOU WILL TURN AROUND, STEP FORWARD, GRIP THE BAR, AND HANG MOTIONLESS. BEGIN. THIS IS USEFUL. YOU'LL RAISE YOUR CHIN ABOVE THE BAR. RIGHT. BEGIN.

YOUR NEXT EVALUATION'S IN THREE DAYS. GENTLEMEN...LADIES, WELCOME TO THE FBI. "WHERE SAME PERSON OR UNLAWFUL OBJECT "COMMITS AN ACT THAT IS KNOWN OR SHOULD BE KNOWN "TO BE LIKELY TO CAUSE DEATH "OR BODILY HARM, "NOTWITHSTANDING "THAT SAME PERSON DESIRES TO AFFECT SAME OBJECT WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSING DEATH OR BODILY HARM." NOW, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? IT COMES. JUST GET INTO IT. ZUCKERMAN, WE'RE FORMING A STUDY GROUP OF SIX INDIVIDUAL FOCUS AREAS. WE MEET NIGHTLY FOR INFORMATION SHARING.

IF A SUBJECT GETS AWAY, YOU WILL WIND UP DEAD. DeWITT, DON'T EVER LET THE SUBJECT SEE YOU FLUSTERED. YOUR ATTITUDE SHOULD BE DOMINANCE. YOU'RE A FEDERAL AGENT. YOU KNOW MORE THAN HIM.

HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN SOMEONE'S LYING? DOES HE AVOID EYE CONTACT OR LOOK AT YOU SIDEWAYS? DOES HE KEEP HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS LIKE HE'S HIDING SOMETHING? WATCH HIS EYES. LET ME SHOW YOU ABOUT EYE CONTACT. WE'LL CONDUCT AN INTERVIEW HERE. MR. GRAHAM, YOU CAN BE MY SUBJECT. YES, SIR. HAVE A SEAT RIGHT HERE, MR. GRAHAM. THANK YOU, SIR. MR.

YOU'RE THE BROADS FROM THE FBI, RIGHT? DiMAZZIO SAYS YOU NEED SOMETHING FOR TARGET PRACTICE. YEAH. IT'S FOR MY PARTNER HERE. WE'RE THINKING ABOUT A 9 MILLIMETER. MAYBE A SIG SAUER 226, BERETTA 9. DOUBLE ACTION OR SINGLE ACTION? DOUBLE OR SINGLE? WHATEVER. YOU KNOW MY TASTES. DOUBLE ACTION. OK, MISS FBI. HOW ABOUT A CZ-75? I SHOT A 3-INCH GROUP-- OW! WITH THIS BABY. NO SIGHT WORK, NOTHIN'. WILLY, IT'S FOR MY PARTNER, AND SHE'S GOING TO USE IT FOR TARGET PRACTICE, BUT LATER SHE'LL USE IT IN THE FIELD. IT'S GOT TO HAVE A 15-SHOT CAPACITY AND ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS. IT'S GOT TO HANDLE THE SILVERTIP AMMO, BUT IT'S ALSO GOT TO HANDLE THE STEEL JACKETED STUFF WITH THE BLACK TIPS. ONE DAY, SHE MAY HAVE TO SHOOT THROUGH A STEEL DOOR. I'D LIKE HER TO HAVE THOSE IN HER HANDBAG. YOU WANT THE SIG, DON'T YOU? YEAH. YEAH. WELL, I GOT A COUPLE OF 'EM, BUT I NORMALLY SAVE THEM FOR MY S.W.A.T. GUYS. YEAH? AND WHAT ARE WE, THE PTL CLUB?

NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU'LL BE LYING IN BED DREAMING ABOUT TARGET PRACTICE. DID YOU NOTICE THAT TRUCK PARKED ACROSS THE STREET? THE BREAD TRUCK? NO. WE SHOULD GO. WE MEET BUTZ AT 5:00 TO REVIEW INVESTIGATIVE DETENTION. WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S DOING THERE? THE BREAD TRUCK? I'LL TAKE A WILD GUESS. DELIVERING BREAD? ANYTHING ELSE? JUST THE CHECK, PLEASE. YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN THERE FOR 20 MINUTES WITH THE MOTOR RUNNING, AND THERE'S NO BREAD STORE AROUND. THERE'S A REAL ESTATE OFFICE, AN EMPTY BUILDING, AND A BANK. SO, MAYBE THE DRIVER STOPPED TO CASH A CHECK. EXCUSE ME, MA'AM. HOW LATE DOES THAT BANK STAY OPEN TILL? CLOSE AT 3:00. THANK YOU. GIVE ME YOUR GUN. YOU KNOW, WE COULD BE SERIOUSLY OVERREACTING HERE. THE GUY'S PROBABLY BRINGING DOUGHNUTS TO HIS GIRLFRIEND WHO'S A BANK TELLER. OK. WE'LL JUST CHECK IT OUT. HOLY SHIT! IT IS A ROBBERY! WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S FEDERAL. IT'S OUR JURISDICTION. WE'LL BUST THEM. OK. YOU CROUCH DOWN REAL LOW, AND MAKE LIKE YOU GOT A GUN RIGHT NEXT TO ME. OK. FBI. FREEZE! PUT YOUR WEAPONS ON THE GROUND! THIS IS GREAT. OK, SCUMSUCKERS...

[SIREN] THIS IS IT, JANICE. EVERYTHING GOING NUTS-- WE WERE READY FOR IT! OK... COME HERE. READ THEM THEIR RIGHTS. I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF THE COPS. FBI. AGENTS DeWITT AND ZUCKERMAN. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT. IF YOU GIVE UP THIS RIGHT, ANYTHING... EVERYTHING... NOTHING... NO PROBLEM. IT'S UNDER CONTROL. IF YOU GIVE UP THIS RIGHT, ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN BE HELD AGAINST YOU. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY. IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD ONE, ONE WILL BE APPOINTED. UNDERSTAND? WE'RE G-MEN, JANICE. YEP. WE'RE THE NEW UNTOUCHABLES. ONE DAY, OUR PICTURE'S GOING TO BE UP HERE, TOO. I DON'T KNOW, ELLIE. YOU WANTED TO SEE US, SIR? THE OTHER SENIOR AGENTS AND I HAVE BEEN REVIEWING YOUR ACTIONS OF THIS AFTERNOON. I NEED TO MAKE SOME THINGS CLEAR. THE FBI IS NOT A S.W.A.T. TEAM. OUR PROCEDURES FOR DEALING WITH A BANK ROBBERY ARE SET FORTH ON PAGE 124 OF THE PROCEDURES MANUAL, WHICH NEITHER OF YOU HAVE READ. "NUMBER ONE, SECURE THE SAFETY "OF INNOCENT BYSTANDERS. "NUMBER TWO, "NOTIFY LOCAL AUTHORITIES REQUESTING BACK-UP. "NUMBER THREE, "FOLLOW PERPETRATORS WITHOUT EXPOSING YOURSELVES. "NUMBER FOUR, "ATTEMPT TO ISOLATE PERPETRATORS FROM BYSTANDERS. "NUMBER FIVE, PROCEED WHEN ABOVE CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN SATISFIED." THE FBI DOES NOT APPROVE OF ITS AGENTS PERPETRATING SATURDAY AFTERNOON SHOOT-OUTS ON STREET CORNERS. IT TAKES A DIMMER VIEW WHEN ITS TRAINEES ENGAGE IN SUCH ACTIVITIES. IT HAPPENED QUICKLY. HAVE YOU TOLD ANYBODY OF THIS INCIDENT? WE JUST GOT BACK. I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE THIS MACHO COP COMPETITION. I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN BEFORE. NOBODY WINS. THE MEDIA'S AGREED TO COOPERATE. THEY WON'T MENTION THAT TRAINEES WERE INVOLVED. IF ANYBODY FINDS OUT, I'LL EXPEL BOTH OF YOU. YOU'RE ON PROBATION. THE ONLY EDGE THIS AGENCY HAS IS THE INTELLIGENCE OF ITS AGENTS. TRY USING SOME. THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU, SIR. THANKS. WRIGHT, "B." STRYKER, "B." DiMAZZIO, "C." YOU FAIL. PETERSON, "C." YOU FAIL. GUANA, "C." YOU FAIL. PARKER, "B." ZUCKERMAN, "A." GOOD WORK, ZUCKERMAN. SHEPHERD, "A." GOOD WORK. BICKERSTAFF, "B." DeWITT, "F." ONE MORE AND YOU'RE OUT. BUTZ, "B." KEANE, "B." NAMI, "C." YOU FAIL. ZEIDEL... FBI. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. UP AGAINST THE WALL. SOMETHING ABOUT YOU DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT. TURN AROUND. SPREAD 'EM! YOU WANT TO BE AN FBI AGENT? STAND STILL. BANG. YOU'RE DEAD. WHAT'S GOING ON? I DON'T NEED THIS BULLSHIT. I COULD BE MAKING $60,000 IN A LOBBYING FIRM. THIS WAS A STUPID FANTASY. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU CAN'T QUIT. WE'RE TEAMMATES. WE'RE NOT TEAMMATES. WE'RE ROOMMATES. JANICE, YOU WERE PICKED AHEAD OF 6,000 PEOPLE. DID YOU KNOW THEY TURNED DOWN RICHARD NIXON? GOOD FOR THEM. YOU'VE COME FURTHER THAN NIXON, AND YOU WANT TO QUIT? I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. THEY NEEDED SOME WOMEN FOR THEIR QUOTAS. THEY DIDN'T WANT US. SO WHAT? WHO CARES? WE'RE HERE. WE'RE HALFWAY HOME. HALFWAY HOME? YOU'RE NOT HALFWAY HOME. YOU'RE FLUNKING. YOU'RE HALFWAY OUT OF HERE. ONLY BRENT WILL MAKE IT. THEY'VE BEEN TRAINING HIM SINCE HE WAS A SPERM. THEY'RE GOING AFTER EVERYBODY'S WEAK POINTS. THIS IS THE FBI WAY. YEAH? WELL, THIS IS THE ZUCKERMAN WAY. I KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS. YOU'VE NEVER FLUNKED ANYTHING, HAVE YOU? YOU GOT IT. WOW. UP TILL NOW, YOU'VE ONLY TRIED STUFF YOU KNEW AHEAD OF TIME YOU'D BE GOOD AT, RIGHT? EXCUSE ME. I FLUNKED PLENTY OF TIMES. NO! IT'S NO BIG DEAL. YOU FLUNK, YOU WORK HARDER. YOU FLUNK MORE, YOU WORK HARDER SOME MORE. YOU OUGHT TO WRITE A BOOK, THE JOY OF FLUNKING. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. MY FIRST MONTH IN THE MARINES, THEY KEPT SCREAMING THAT I WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH. I REALIZED THEY WERE RIGHT. I WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH. I CAN HELP YOU WITH THE PHYSICAL STUFF. I CAN SHOW YOU STUFF THAT ISN'T IN BOOKS. YEAH? WHAT'S IT TO YOU? I WANT TO PASS. I WANT TO BE AN FBI AGENT. AND RIGHT NOW, I'M HAVING A FEW PROBLEMS. I WAS HOPING YOU MIGHT GIVE ME A HAND. IF YOU DO THAT, MAYBE WE'LL BOTH HAVE A CHANCE. YOU KNOW? YOU'RE DREAMING. SO? YOU WERE GOING TO QUIT. TRUE. SQUEEZE THE TRIGGER, DON'T SNAP IT. RELAX. HAVE SOME FUN. YOU'RE CLINT EASTWOOD, ALL RIGHT? DO AMERICA A FAVOR. BLOW THE SCUM OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH. YEAH. FIND THE BUZZ WORDS, UNDERLINE THEM. PUT COLORED PAPER CLIPS BY THEM. YOU'VE GOT TO START TALKING LIKE AN FBI AGENT. FORGET ABOUT FOOT SWEEPS. BEST MOVE FOR YOU, KICK IN THE BALLS. A KICK IN THE BALLS? ONLY PROBLEM IS, ANYONE WITH TRAINING WILL EXPECT IT. YOU'VE GOT TO SURPRISE THEM! 14th AMENDMENT? DUE PROCESS. 8th? GUARANTEES AGAINST UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT. [BUZZ] NOW THE RIGHT ARM. COMMON LAW PRINCIPLES STRUCK DOWN BY GARNER VS. MEMPHIS? FLEEING FELON RULE. CONDITIONS JUSTIFYING SEIZURE OF A VEHICLE... YOU GOING TO EAT THOSE? YOU TALKIN' TO ME? I DIDN'T THINK SO. WITHIN THE CONSTITUTION, IS THERE A SPECIFIC... WALKER, "B+."

YOU MEAN, LIKE GO OUT? YEAH. WE COULD ROLL DOWN TO WASHINGTON, DO A CHECK-IT-OUT THING. YEAH. THAT WOULD BE GREAT. I'VE GOT A CAR. I'LL PICK YOU UP... 7:00? OK. OK. I'LL SEE YOU THEN. ALL RIGHT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU AND BRENT, OUR NATION'S CAPITAL, TO DO KIND OF A CHECK-IT-OUT THING? SOUNDS LIKE PARADISE. HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE ME SOMEPLACE NICE. PROBABLY. WHAT AM I GOING TO WEAR? I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT. CALL IT OFF! YOU KNOW ABOUT CLOTHES. HELP ME. WE COULD GO SHOPPING. ROLL DOWN TO WASHINGTON, DO A CHECK-IT-OUT THING. CAN I HELP YOU? MY FRIEND HAS A DATE WITH A SENATOR. SHE NEEDS SOMETHING SEXY. THIS WAY, PLEASE. HE'S NOT A SENATOR. HE'S AN FBI AGENT. AN EMBASSY PARTY? SOCIAL SURVEILLANCE? THAT SORT OF THING? NO, JUST DINNER. SHE HAS GREAT LEGS. IT SHOULD MOVE WHEN SHE WALKS. MAYBE SOMETHING SLIT UP TO THE WAIST. SOMETHING THAT SAYS, "JUMP ME!" THIS IS BEN VINUTI. I THINK IT WOULD LOOK FABULOUS ON YOU. UHH. UHLL. KIND OF NICE, HUH? WHAT DO YOU THINK? REALLY WANT TO KNOW? DO YOU MIND? NOT AT ALL. OK. THE WAIST IS TOO LOW. IT SHOULD TAPER MORE. THE BACK LOOKS SHORT. SHORT? YEAH. THE DARTS ARE OFF ANGLE. THIS HEM IS MACHINE-STITCHED. FOR THIS KIND OF MONEY, IT SHOULD BE HAND-STITCHED. THE ONLY THING IT WILL BRING YOU IS A VISIT FROM THE FASHION POLICE. IT'S NOT YOUR COLOR. DO YOU HAVE THAT JAPANESE STUFF? OF COURSE. THANK YOU. WE'LL FIND YOU SOMETHING. LOVE THE SOCKS. I'VE NEVER SPENT $400 ON AN OUTFIT IN MY LIFE. TOO BAD YOU'RE WASTING IT ON AN ARROGANT NUDNIK.

WELL, DITTO. ALL SET. WOW. YOU LOOK AMAZING. YEAH? YEAH. THANK YOU. GEE, I'M HUNGRY. WANT SOME POPCORN? NO, THANKS. SHOULD WE GO? SEE YOU LATER, JANICE. BYE. [DOOR SHUTS] IN MY FAMILY, THE FBI'S LIKE A RELIGION. AN FBI FAMILY IS NOT NORMAL. LIFE IS A TACTICAL EXERCISE. WE WERE BROUGHT UP IN CONDITION YELLOW-- AWARE OF OUR SURROUNDINGS, READY TO RESPOND. I THINK MY FAMILY IS MORE THE HAPPY- GO-LUCKY TYPE. IT GOES BACK TO MY GRANDFATHER. HE WAS STUDYING TO BE A PRIEST, BUT HE FELT HE COULD DO MORE FOR AMERICA. J. EDGAR HOOVER WAS LOOKING FOR AMERICANS WITH A HIGHER SENSE OF PURPOSE. HE AND MY GRANDDAD HIT IT OFF. WE'VE BEEN AN FBI FAMILY EVER SINCE. IT SOUNDS ULTRA-AMERICAN, BUT IT'S WHAT I AM. I TRIED REBELLING. I LET MY HAIR GROW, WENT TO ROCK CONCERTS. DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT. THIS FEELS RIGHT. [CARS HONKING] THE LIGHT'S CHANGED. THANKS. [KNOCK ON DOOR] IT'S OPEN. HI. HI. OK, UM, YOU KNOW THE GUY AT THE LIBRARY? HE SAID YOU HAD PSYCHOLOGY OF DEVIANTS. I WONDERED IF YOU WERE THROUGH WITH IT. MAYBE. HE ALSO SAID YOU HAD TAKEN PROFILES IN ABERRANT BEHAVIOR, AND VIOLENCE OF THE MIND. I NEED THEM, TOO. I THOUGHT IF YOU'RE NOT ACTIVELY USING THEM... NOT ACTIVELY. THEY'RE OVER THERE. GREAT. GREAT. GOOD. OK. GREAT. IT'S NOT A DESK. IT'S A DELI. DID YOU EVER TRY SESAME SNACKS? THEY'RE FANTASTIC. THE THING ABOUT-- WHAT IS THIS? IT'S WEIRD. UH, OK. GOT 'EM. I'LL BE BACK IN THREE HOURS. OK. THANK YOU. ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO SPEND SATURDAY NIGHT STUDYING? YEAH. IT'S A LIFESTYLE THING. PBS IS AIRING A SPECIAL ON NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS. INTERESTED? HOW LONG IS IT? AN HOUR. TOO LONG. HALF HOUR, MAYBE, BUT... I HAVE A LOT TO DO. WATCH THE FIRST HALF. YEAH. I COULD WATCH A HALF HOUR AND THEN STUDY. OK. YOU'RE SUCH A WORRIER. I KNOW. OH. IT'S TERRIBLE. YOU'RE RIGHT. I SHOULD PUT ON SOME CLOTHES. I'LL WAIT OUTSIDE. THANK YOU. THIS IS SO GREAT. THE CLOSEST I'VE EVER BEEN TO A PLACE LIKE THIS IS WATCHING DALLAS. DO YOU WANT SOME MORE WHITE WINE? MMM. EXCUSE ME, WAITER. COULD WE HAVE ANOTHER WINE AND A MARGARITA? MY DAD SAYS, "WASHINGTON IS A NATION UNTO ITSELF." YOU KNOW, DO YOU AND YOUR DAD AND YOUR GRANDDAD EVER GET TOGETHER AND FORGET ABOUT THE FBI AND GET BLASTED? SURE. WE DOWN A FEW ON SUPERBOWL SUNDAY. FRANKLY, THEY'RE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE BUREAU THESE DAYS. WHAT? DON'T TAKE THIS PERSONALLY. THEY FEEL THIS EQUAL RIGHTS IS LOWERING THE CALIBER OF NEW AGENTS. YOU'RE KIDDING? NOT YOU. YOU WERE A MARINE. THEY'D LOVE YOU, BUT SOME OF THE OTHERS... LIKE ZUCKERMAN-- GIVE ME A BREAK. WHAT'S WRONG WITH ZUCKERMAN? SERIOUSLY, CAN YOU SEE HER FUNCTIONING AS AN AGENT? YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'S LIKE? SHE'S LIKE THOSE PEOPLE WHO BRAKE FOR A CAT IN THE ROAD AND CAUSE A 12-CAR PILEUP. YOU CAN'T STOP FOR A CAT IN THE ROAD. YOU'VE GOT TO BE PREPARED TO MASH THEM INTO THE PAVEMENT. SHE'S GUTLESS. SHE'LL GET CUT. DID YOU HEAR ABOUT O'SULLIVAN, THE IRS AGENT? SHE'S OUT. THEY TOLD HER TODAY. THANKS. BY THE WAY, I'VE SEEN ZUCKERMAN SHOW A LOT OF GUTS. OH, RIGHT. WHAT DID SHE DO? PUSH INTO LINE AT THE DAIRY QUEEN? BRENT, SHE'S MY FRIEND. NO, I KNOW. SHE STARTED WEARING MIDLENGTH SKIRTS WHEN EVERYONE ELSE WAS STILL WEARING LONG. HA HA HA! [DOOR SLAMS] HAVE A NICE TIME? NOT REALLY. [DOOR SLAMS] OOPS. FBI. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. FBI. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. YOU STILL HERE? HANDS OVER YOUR HEAD. GIVE IT UP. YOU'RE NOT CUT OUT FOR THIS. OW! OOH! YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT. IF YOU GIVE UP THIS RIGHT, ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN BE USED AGAINST YOU. IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD ONE, AN ATTORNEY WILL BE APPOINTED. DO YOU UNDERSTAND EACH OF THESE RIGHTS? UHH. SEE YOU IN CLASS, BUCKO. AS YOU REVIEW THESE CASES, REMEMBER, THEY DOCUMENT REAL CRIMES INVESTIGATED BY REAL AGENTS. YOU WILL WRITE A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF EACH OF THESE CASES, EVALUATING THE METHODS EMPLOYED BY THE AGENTS INVOLVED. BE THOROUGH. IT'S CRUNCH TIME. CASE SEVEN-- SUSPECTED THEFT OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY. THIS ONE'S SELF-EVIDENT. CASE EIGHT-- COULD WE GO BACK TO NUMBER SEVEN? ZUCKERMAN, IT'S 9:00. WE HAVE 11 OTHER CASES TO REVIEW FOR TOMORROW. I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE INTERVIEW OF THE STUDENT WORKING THE NIGHT SHIFT-- THE BAGGER. THE AGENTS DIDN'T DO A COMPREHENSIVE JOB. THEY DIDN'T ASK ANYTHING PERSONAL. THEY ASKED WHAT HE KNEW. THEY ASKED WHAT HE SAW. NOTHING. HOW DO WE KNOW IF HE'S TRUTHFUL? WE HAVE NOTHING TO MEASURE IT AGAINST. COME ON. WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? LET'S JUST REVIEW THE FIELD NOTES. NOBODY CARES IF SOME DRY CLEANER LOST NAVY BLANKETS. I CARE. OK. FINE. ABOUT THE NAVY BLANKETS THAT DISAPPEARED FROM THE WASHINGTON DRY CLEANERS, MS. ZUCKERMAN AND MS. DeWITT FEEL THE INVESTIGATING AGENTS DID NOT GET PERSONAL ENOUGH. THIS IS A ZERO CASE. OUR TIME WOULD BE BETTER SPENT IF WE MOVED ON. ALL IN FAVOR? YOU'RE OUTVOTED. CASE EIGHT--THE LONG ISLAND KIDNAPING... THE AGENTS ON THAT BLANKET CASE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN IT FURTHER. WHAT WOULD YOU DO ABOUT IT? I DON'T KNOW. I'M JUST COMPLAINING. LET'S CHECK THE GUY OUT. ARE WE ALLOWED TO DO THAT? IT'S OUR JOB TO CHECK EVERY DETAIL. HE WAS A SOPHOMORE AT BOLTON WHEN IT HAPPENED. HE'S PROBABLY A JUNIOR NOW. OK, DUANE BURBICK, ROOM 103. ELLIE, WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO CRAZY. WE WON'T DRAW OUR GUNS. WE'LL TELL HIM WE'RE JOURNALISM STUDENTS, ASK SOME QUESTIONS, AND LEAVE. YOU SHOULD BE THE GOOD COP. I'LL BE THE BAD COP. I'D LIKE TO BE THE BAD COP. YOU LOOK LIKE A GOOD COP. THEY WOULDN'T EXPECT IT THEN. LET'S JUST PLAY IT BY EAR, OK? * SHE WORKED ALL DAY IN HER OLD MAN'S STORE * [CLICK] * SHE WANTS TO EARN SOME MORE * * DADDY'S LITTLE ANGEL TALKS IN CHURCH * * BY THE END OF THE WEEK... ** THIS GUY'S A SLOB. GET HIM! YEAH! WOOO! LET'S GO! AW! AW! THERE'S THE SNAP... OH! GO! GO! GO! AHH! COME ON! WHICH ONE DO YOU THINK IS DUANE? HEY, DUANE! HOW'S IT COMING, DUDE? ALMOST THERE, DUDE. HA HA HA!

ALL RIGHT, MAN. LOOK, DUDES. THIS HEAVY STUFF'S BRINGING ME WAY DOWN, YOU KNOW? SO UNLESS YOU WANT TO PARTY SERIOUSLY, TAKE A WALK. I'M GOING TO WATCH THE GAME. OH, YOU WIMPS! YOU WIMPS! AW!
