(DRUM ROLL) (FANFARE MUSIC PLAYING) NARRATOR:In a time before many can remember, our planet faced its greatest challenge. A warlord named Piccolo came from beyond the stars, bringing darkness and chaos to our once peaceful world. Aided by his disciple Oozaru, the evil pair brought the human race to the brink of annihilation. Cities and countries crumbled beneath them. Countless lives were lost. But, finally, a group of brave warriors created the Ma Fu Ba, a powerful enchantment that imprisoned Piccolo deep within the Earth. With his master captured, Oozaru disappeared, and balance was slowly restored to our world. And so it has remained for thousands of years, until now. The first rule is there are no rules. First one to touch the ground loses. Prepare to eat dirt. (GRUNTING) Whoa! (SHOUTING) (WHIMPERS) (CHUCKLES) (BOTH GRUNTING) (LAUGHS) Ha! - (SHOUTS) - Whoa! (LAUGHING) - (LAUGHS) - (BUZZING) (SHOUTS) (SHOUTS) (GROANS) Whoa! (GROANS) - (CHUCKLING) - (SHUDDERS) (LAUGHING) Harsh. Man! Yeah. Shadow Crane strike. You fell for it again. Well, it's kind of hard to block a move that I can't see. Goku, you rely too heavily on your external senses. To see, to hear, to touch are all overrated. Oh, true power comes from inside. Your Ki. Yeah. That's your best defense and your greatest weapon. See? Now use your Ki. Mmm. (AIR WHOOSHING) (GROANS) I'm sorry, Grandpa. I didn't feel a thing. Someday, Goku. Yeah. Someday I'll beat you. That'll be something to tell your friends beating up on a 70-year-old man. What friends? Everybody at school treats me like I'm nothing, Grandpa. - You're special, Goku. - No. I'm different. I know that, and they know that too. They push me so far that I want to explode. You know, I could tear them apart with one hand. I don't train you to fight boys, Goku. You promised. Okay. You made me promise not to fight. Then teach me something I can use. Teach me... Teach me how to get the girl. Teach me how to talk to her without stumbling all over everything I say. Teach me how to be normal. Normal is also overrated. (STAMMERS) You must have faith in who you are. (SCOFFS) Goku. Happy birthday. (LAUGHS) You think I forgot? Sushinchu is yours. - GOKU: What is it? - GOHAN: It's a Dragon Ball. GOHAN:Sushinchu means "four stars". In all the world, there are only six others, from one to seven stars. Besides you, Goku, it's my only treasure. - So what's it do? - By itself, nothing. But together, the seven Dragon Balls will grant the holder one perfect wish. So keep it safe always. Thanks, Grandpa. (CHUCKLES) (UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) - (HORNS HONKING) - (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (TIRES SQUEAL) Whoa! GOKU: What... - (CAR ALARM CHIRPS) - Hey, Fuller. Hey, Fuller! You just wrecked my bike. Agundes, did you just fart, man? 'Cause I could have swore I just heard something. You're gonna pay for this, Fuller. Make me pay, "Geeko." Come on. Come on, Geeko. Right here. Come on, baby. Show me what you got. (ALL LAUGHING) Just like I thought. Nothin'. Carey, let's go. I'm gonna be late for class. Beauty awaits me. - CAREY: What's up, Emi? - Hey. BOY 1: He looks like he's gonna cry. BOY 2: What's the matter with you? (WHIRRING) (SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (MAN SHOUTING IN JAPANESE INDISTINCTLY) (PANTING) (IN JAPANESE) It's all right. (WOOD CREAKING) (GUN CLICKS) (IN JAPANESE) I have what you want. (IN JAPANESE) On your knees. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (CLICKS, WHIRS) (EXPLOSION) This is an astrological phenomenon known as a complete solar eclipse. In two weeks' time, we'll all have the opportunity... to experience this rare phenomenon for ourselves. Now, what causes eclipses, hmm? - WEAVER: Mr. Kingery. - KINGERY: Weaver. WEAVER: A solar eclipse is caused by the moon blocking the sun from the Earth. KINGERY: Correct. From the dawn of civilization, superstitions have marked solar eclipses as the sign of the apocalypse. KINGERY:In India, for example, the eclipse symbolizes Rahu, - demon of darkness, devouring the sun. - (BIRDS CHIRPING) The Chinese believe eclipses are caused by a dragon... (CAPTIVATING MUSIC PLAYING) KINGERY: Goku. - Goku! - Yeah. What? What might our ancestors say about the upcoming solar eclipse? Oh, uh, well, my grandfather would say, "Beware of the Nameks". Nameks? Yeah. They're an alien race that nearly destroyed Earth over... uh, 2,000 years ago. Well, let's hope it doesn't happen again, hmm? (ALL CHUCKLING) - CHI CHI: Oh, no. - (LOCKER LOCK BEEPING) Oh, great. Not again. I hate those things. They never work. And just look at my picture. I have a paper due next period, and it's stuck in here. - (BELL RINGS) - Gotta go. (BANGING) - (GRUNTS) - (BEEPING) Damn it! Oh! Hey. Goku, right? (WHISPERS) Yeah. - Did you do that? - Uh, yeah. You used your Ki. Wait. You know about Ki? Just because my name is Chi Chi, doesn't make me a complete idiot. Right. Right. 'Cause there's a lot stupider names than Chi Chi. I'm not saying that Chi Chi's a stupid name. I'm just saying that it's not normal. Ah. But normal is overrated. I'm not saying that you're stupid or overrated. I'm just... I'm gonna stop now. Hey. I'm having a party tonight at my house. I'll be there. - CHI CHI: Okay. - GOKU (WHISPERS): Yes! (CRICKETS CHIRPING) Hi. Hi. Hi, Chi Chi. (CHUCKLES) Hi. GOHAN: Goku! I got fresh chicken feet! Yeah. Couldn't find good swallow's tongue. Ah, but the squabs were fat. Beauty awaits. GOHAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Mmm. Goku. Happy birthday! (LAUGHING) Goku? (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (CHATTERING) Hey. Check it out. (CHUCKLES) There he is. What are you doing here, Geeko? Uh, I'm just going to the party. Look, I was invited. I'm not looking for any trouble. Trouble found you, freak. So, listen. Why don't you turn around, walk away, no one will even know you were here. See ya. - BOY: Later, loser. - All right. (LAUGHING) I'm not doing that anymore. I made a promise that I wasn't gonna fight. What? I made a promise that I'm not gonna fight. Oh. Don't worry. It won't be a fight. - (GLASS SHATTERS) - It'll be a massacre. Missed. (GRUNTS) Missed again. (SHOUTS) (GRUNTS) (SHOUTS) (SHOUTS) (SHOUTS) (SHOUTING) (GROANS) Whoa! - (SHOUTS) - (GROANS) (GROANING) My hand! That's gotta hurt. Hey, Chi Chi. Hey. Thanks for inviting me to your party. Oh, uh, and, Fuller, your boys, they've been showing me what they got. - (ALL GROANING) - Nothin'. You're so dead. No, Carey, stop! (GRUNTS) - (CAR ALARM BEEPING) - My car! Nice swing. Good form. Close one. (GRUNTS) - Ooh, ooh. - (GRUNTING) (GASPS) Doing good. Hey, Fuller. Hey. You got a couple of dings there you might want to try buffing out. (BOTH SHOUT) (BOTH GROAN) - (CAREY WHIMPERING) - (CAR ALARM CONTINUES) (GASPS) (CAR ALARM STOPS) (SLOW ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) You've never done this before, have you? Uh, yes. Many times. - In my head. - (CHUCKLES) You're different. - It's... - I like different. I know this may be hard to believe, but... we're a lot alike. (CHUCKLES) This is the best birthday I've ever had. Today's your birthday? Yeah. Actually, right now. Ever since I can remember, me and my grandpa celebrate my birthday at the exact same time. He calls it my grand entrance. - What happened to your parents? - Uh, I don't know. But my grandpa said everything will be explained to me when I turn 18. And I'm 18. Cool. (CHUCKLES) - (BIRD SQUAWKS) - (BOTH CHUCKLE) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (WIND WHISTLING) (SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING) - (SWISHING) - (GRUNTS) (GASPS) (SWISHING) (GRUNTS) Yeah. Come. Piccolo! It's not here. (HISSES) (GROANING) Dear, God. No! PICCOLO: I will have the Dragon Ball, old man. (GROANING) (GRUNTING) Something's wrong. Something is... Something's wrong with my grandpa. - What? - I have to go. I'm sorry. - Goku. - GOKU: I'll see you later! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! (GROANS, PANTING) (WEAKLY) Goku. GOKU (WHISPERING): No. (GRUNTS) (GROANING) - Come on Come on, come on, come on. - (GROANS) (MURMURS) - Grandpa, I'm gonna go get help. - No. Stay here with me. Not much time left. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Grandpa, I wasn't here. - What happened? - Piccolo has returned. He's after the Dragon Ball. Is it safe? - Yeah. - It has begun. (SHOUTS) (COUGHING) Find Master Roshi in Paozu. Tell him Piccolo has returned. To banish Piccolo from this world, you must find the Dragon Balls before the eclipse. - What? - "Seven Dragon Balls must be found, - "for all man's fate will be bound." - All right. Grandpa. Stop. Stop. You have to rest. You have to rest. Goku. Remember. Always have faith in who you are. (SOBBING) (BIRD SQUAWKS) (SNIFFLES) - Grandpa. - (GOHAN LAUGHING IN THE DISTANCE) (GLASS CLINKS) Where is it? I know it's here. Are you Piccolo? Did you kill my grandfather? Listen, idiot. If I was a piccolo, whatever that is, I wouldn't tell you. And if I did kill your grandfather, I would have shot you by now. Somebody stole my Promethium Orb, and I'm here to get it back. What? - (BEEPING) - You have it. Nice move. But I'm not gonna miss again. My father found that Promethium Orb 20 years ago, and you stole it from me last night. I'm not leaving here without it. I don't know what you're talking about. This is a Dragon Ball. Sushinchu. Four-star ball. I promised my grandfather I would keep it safe, so I'm not letting anyone take it from me. Four stars? Promethium Orb has five stars. Who's the idiot? Look at it. Oh, my God. - (GUN POWERS DOWN) - I could have killed you. Oh, you weren't even close. I knew it. There are others. - Seven, to be exact. - What do you want for this one? - It's not for sale. - Everybody's got a price. Not me. What happened to your Dragon Ball? Last night, a thief broke into my father's company Capsule Corporation. Somebody hacked the vault, killed the guards and stole the Dragon Ball. I swore to my father I'd get it back. I followed the signal here, and that's when I ran into you. I'm sorry I fired on you. I thought you were a murdering thief. Just lucky you weren't a better shot. How'd you know I had the Dragon Ball? A little machine I invented. This can detect and locate the signature wavelengths emitted by the Dragon Balls. - See? - (BEEPING) You made a Dragon Ball energy locater? - Cool. - Dragon Ball energy. "D.B.E." - Catchy name. - So you must be a scientist. Ph.D. in applied dynamics, with a minor in tactical weaponry. I'm close to a breakthrough. I can feel it. The key must be the other Dragon Balls. I have to have them all. What good's the Dragon Balls gonna do you? They're gonna make me famous. I'm gonna make them an unlimited source of energy. Good luck with that. I'm Goku. You know, maybe we could help each other. See, I need to find a Master Roshi in Paozu. If you take me there, I'll help you find the Dragon Balls. I have the D.B.E. Why would I need you? Well, obviously, somebody else is looking for them. And you... you might need backup. Bulma Briefs. (SIGHS) - Hey, where's your, uh... - (BEEPS) Ride? Cool. (ENGINE SPUTTERING) (EXHILARATING MUSIC PLAYING) COMPUTERIZED VOICE:Directory information downloaded. I have tried every possible spelling of Roshi, in the directory. - He's not listed. - Did you try "Master"? - M-A-S... - (SCOFFS, WHISPERS) Idiot. Are you sure you don't want one? He's here. How do you know? Hmm. I can always sense my grandfather. I know he's gone now, but I can... I'm getting the same feeling. (BEEPING) There's another Dragon Ball here. Let's go! (GRUNTS) (BEEPING) GOKU: Bulma. Bulma! Bulma, wait. (WHISPERING) Bulma, wait! Bulma, you can't just break into someone's house. We're not breaking in. Door's unlocked. All right. This girl's out of control. (WHISPERING) Bulma. (WHISPERING) Bulma! (BEEPING) Bulma. (DOOR HINGES CREAK) No. - (CLINKS) - (SNORTS) - (CLINKS) - Thief! (SHOUTS) Aah! (GROANS) - This is not what you... - (SHOUTS) (GROANS) (BONES CRACKING) This is not happening. Believe it, punk. You are getting your clock cleaned. (GOKU GRUNTING) Ooh! - (GROANS) - (BONES CRACKING) You have been trained well. Stop. You both have to stop. Now, I am going to end it. - (SHOUTS) - (GROANS) Sorry. Shadow Crane strike. I'd recognize that anywhere. - How's Gohan? - You knew my grandfather? Knew him? I trained him. You are Master Roshi. I am Muten Roshi, the Invincible! (LAUGHING) My grandfather is dead. He was murdered. I will avenge him. But before he... he died, he asked me to find you and to tell you that Piccolo has returned. He said that you would know what to do. He also told me a poem. It was "Seven Dragon Balls." "Seven Dragon Balls must be found, "for all man's fate will be bound "to battle forces of death and fear and compel Shenlong to appear." It was a nursery rhyme, told to us by ancient master. Then you probably know we have to find the Dragon Balls before the eclipse. Eclipse? Do you have a Dragon Ball? (FROG CROAKS) Bikini Quarterly? (CHUCKLES SHEEPISHLY) That's a collector's edition. - (SHOUTS) - Goku! - GOHAN: Goku. - (GASPS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) If the prophecy is true, in seven days, the sun will be eclipsed by the blood moon. That will be the beginning of the apocalypse. Roshi, don't be crazy. You said it yourself. It's a nursery rhyme. ROSHI: Yes. Because before tonight, I could make no sense of it. But, finally, I can see. You! You are the key somehow. Gohan knew it. - That's why he trained you. - Okay, Goku. This has been great. You found your Master Roshi. I kept my part of the bargain. Now it's time for you to keep yours. Let's go. If what Gohan said is true and Piccolo is here, this wish may be the only thing that can save our world. We'll go. But we go together. (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) Much easier to find without the water. I will take you to a secret place where a chosen few were taught to master the energy of the three elements, air, fire and water. Shadow Crane strike is the most basic of all the air-bending techniques. To learn what I have to teach you, you have to become stronger. (CHUCKLES) You wanted him. Although I am beginning to appreciate the entertainment value. All right. (SIGHS) Leave your hand there another second and you'll lose it. - Let's go. - (GUN POWERS DOWN) (ENGINE RUMBLING) This stone temple has been a source of solitude and enlightenment for millennia. Here, you will learn what I learned from the ancient master. Oh! BULMA: I thought you said this place is secret. - (ALL SHOUTING, GRUNTING) - Chi Chi? - (GRUNTING) - Chi Chi. (GASPS) - (GROANS) - (CHUCKLES) - (CHEERING) - Yeah! Yeah! Wow. Hey, Goku. What are you doing here? I was just about to ask you the same thing. - Walk with me? - Yeah. This is where everyone comes to train for the big tournament in Toisan. That's what I, uh, wanted to tell you at the party, before you suddenly took off. I heard about your grandfather's accident. I'm so sorry. The house collapsed? Uh, yeah. Something like that. Hey. What was it that you wanted to tell me? Nobody at home knows this, but I'm a fighter too. They just wouldn't understand. Goku. Let's go. I gotta go. Come to the tournament in Toisan. Maybe we can find some time to mix it up. Okay. We can't train here. My Ki is shriveling up. Hey. At least, this won't be a total waste. I got a signal from a Dragon Ball. Let's go. Now, one hand. To master the second level of air-bending, you have to control two things at once. Knock this orange from my hand. (GRUNTS) - (BEEPING) - I'm getting a strong signal from a Dragon Ball only three miles ahead. - Whoa! - (SCREAMS) BOTH: Whoa! (SHOUTS) (SCREAMS) - BULMA: Whoa! - Sorry. (GROANS) What happened? That hole came out of nowhere. Whoa! Need any help down there? Let me handle this. Oh! You are such a lifesaver. We are just stuck down here. I'd be, uh, so grateful if you could just help me and my friends out. For a pretty thing like you? No problemo. Thank you. You're a real gentleman. Yamcha, at your service. I'm gonna need some payment. - (SNICKERS) - Payment? Who do you think made this trap? (CHUCKLES) Wait a minute. Is that a Capsule RX 550 Roadster, I see down there? Yo! I'll take that. - You're nothing but a lowlife bandit. - YAMCHA: Yeah. But one with a ladder. Just think it over, 'cause after the sun comes out, it's gonna be hot, hot, hot. (CHUCKLES) Hot! - (GOKU SCREAMS) - (THUDS) Now all we need are marshmallows and a ghost story. We have no marshmallows, but I do have a story. Two thousand years ago, the Earth was nearly destroyed. Not by man but by gods from the sky. Their names were Piccolo and Oozaru. Seven mystics banded together to fight the invaders. They sacrificed their lives to cast the Ma Fu Ba, a powerful curse that imprisoned Piccolo. Now, Piccolo has somehow escaped. In two days, the blood moon will eclipse the sun, and bring forth Oozaru, his disciple. To stop Piccolo, whoever can find all seven Dragon Balls, can resurrect the power of Shenlong and be granted one perfect wish. Unless we find the Dragon Balls and use our wish to banish Piccolo from this world, we will have no defense against the onslaught. What a crock! (CHUCKLES) You expect me to believe that? I do not. I think you are the kind of person who does not believe in anything. I feel sorry for you. Yeah. Whatever. I'm not the one stuck in the hole. Let us out! Now! (GRUNTS) (GASPS) Whoa there, jumping bean. One more outburst like that, and I'm out of here. (BEEPING) The Dragon Ball's close. But I think it's buried underground. ROSHI: Enough games. We have no time to waste. - Send down a net. - Hey, Rosh. We're gonna need some tools to excavate! How would you like to make more money than you ever dreamed of? Now you're talking, bro. Wh... Oh. If that D.B.E. thing is right, the ball you're looking for is right here. Let's go. Come on! You have no right to give away a third of the royalties to my invention. One day, Dragon Balls could power the world. Don't worry. A third of zero is still zero. Done. Whoo! Ooh, yeah. - (EXHALES) - Well, I guess if you hadn't robbed us, we wouldn't be able to get this Dragon Ball. Well, everything happens for a reason, bro. Got that one from daytime TV. (CLICKS TONGUE) - GOKU: The Dragon Ball is close. - ROSHI: Be on your guard. Piccolo is also after the Dragon Ball. MAI: I followed Muten Roshi, as directed. He is training the boy, Son Goku. I could disrupt them. No. This will require more than a disruption. (ROARS) Your blood will give it life. (ROARING) (PANTING) The Dragon Balls are within my grasp. And with them, the power to destroy this world. (ROARS) (ENTHRALLING MUSIC PLAYING) So, after we get the seven Dragon Balls, how soon can I expect some profit? Huh? A month? A year? - (BEEPING) - (SIGHS) High temps are screwing with the signal. I can't get a good read on it. - (GRUNTS) - (RUMBLING) - (STEAM HISSES) - (SCREAMING) Peas and rice! I just fried my na... (YELPS) - (LAUGHING) - Oh! But I see it. GOKU: The problem is how to get across. Come on! (GASPS) - (GASPS) - (ROARING) (SCREAMS) BULMA: Goku, down! - (GRUNTS) - (SHRIEKS) YAMCHA: Hey! - Huh? - Go! Go! - (ROARS) - (GRUNTS) - GOKU: Hit 'em, Rosh! - (SHOUTS) Into the lava! That's the only way to stop them! - (SHOUTS) - (SHRIEKS) (SHRIEKING) (ROARS) - (SHOUTS) - (SHRIEKING) - What are you doing? - Making a bridge! (GRUNTS) (STRAINING) (GRUNTING) (SHRIEKS) Impressive! (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) (GASPS) Whoa! Ah! (PANTING) (ROARS) (SCREAMS) GOHAN: The power to prevent this is inside you. (GRUNTS) - (GASPS) - (GRUNTS) (GASPS) - (GRUNTS) - (SHOUTS, GASPS) Master Roshi, the Dragon Balls. - They've been speaking to you. - Yeah. - They are showing you a future. - There's this demon... Oozaru. The Destroyer. He will kill you. And Bulma. And Yamcha. He will destroy everything. The future's always changing. Let the dragon show you his lessons. I need to somehow defeat Oozaru. The eclipse is in two days. We'll never find the other Dragon Balls in time. ROSHI: There is another way to stop Piccolo. The only chance the world has now... is in Toisan. Toisan. (CLICKING) (WIND WHISTLING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Roshi. How is my favorite skeptic? I come to apologize, Sifu Norris. Everything that I questioned before... I now know is all true. The prophecy. The blood moon will eclipse the sun tomorrow. I need your help. I need another containment vessel. The Ma Fu Ba? That will consume all of your life forces. When you put it that way, the plan sucks. But the boy will not be ready. Mmm. It's the only way. I'm the only one who can do it. We will have it ready by the morning. Namaste. (GRUNTING) (CROWD ROARING) Ready? Let's go. (GRUNTING) (GROANS) (GRUNTS) (CROWD JEERING) REFEREE: Black concedes. Why enter the tournament if you're not gonna fight? - (GONG RESOUNDS) - (CHEERING) MALE ANNOUNCER: The winner by concession, Red. FEMALE ANNOUNCER: (SPEAKING JAPANESE) - CHI CHI: Goku! - Whoa! - You made it. - Yeah. Wh-What's this? MALE ANNOUNCER: Watanabe versus Tanaka. Are you okay? Uh, yeah. It's nothing. Are you in the tournament? No, I'm here for something else. Something more important than me? Actually, you're one of the reasons why it's so important. BULMA: I've got a confession to make. - I wanted to be famous. - (SCOFFS) - I wanted to be rich. - (CHUCKLES) Well, neither of us are gonna get what we wanted. - Look at these people. - (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) - They have no idea. - Yeah. YAMCHA: I wish I didn't know myself. Never thought I could enjoy talking to a thief. (CHUCKLES) You know, (CHUCKLES) I'm not so bad once you get to know me. Maybe I like bad men. That's good to know on the day before the end of the world. (MAN SHOUTS) (MAN YELLING IN CHINESE) Hey. We still have our Dragon Balls. That's right. Piccolo needs all seven. He still can't make his wish either. And that means you can still make your 30%. Wha... Thirty-three and a third! - Don't push it. - No, 33 and a third! (AIR WHOOSHES) (AIR WHOOSHES) (AIR WHOOSHES) The final level of air-bending technique is the Kame Hame Ha. Yeah. My grandpa old me about that. But he said that I wasn't ready to learn it yet. - You are not. - Okay. But time is running out. To master the Kame Hame Ha, you have to master your Ki. Draw the power of the universe. (INHALES DEEPLY) (EXHALES) Channel it through you. (AIR WHOOSHES) (INHALES DEEPLY) (AIR WHOOSHES) (SHOUTS) (WHOOSHING) Focus it. Then release! What? The more you put yourself into the Kame Hame Ha, the greater the power. Practice. Light the torches in the courtyard. I will see you in the morning. Mm-hmm. (WHOOSHES) Man. - (EXHALES) - (BIRD CHIRPING) (WHOOSHING) (INHALES, EXHALES) (WHOOSHING) CHI CHI: That's cheating. You're supposed to light the torches with your Ki. Have you been watching me? Then I guess you know why I have to cheat. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) (BLOWS, GROANS) You know, my grandpa always said in order to master my Ki, I have to be at one with myself and with my enemy. I still don't know what that means. Maybe you need an incentive. Whoa. There are five unlit torches in this courtyard. You're five paces away from me. Every time you light a torch, you get to take one step closer to me. What happens after I light all five torches? (CLEARS THROAT) Then you'll be standing right next to me... where I can reach you. You're on. (WHOOSHING) Very impressive. Yeah. (WHOOSHING) Not bad. (EXHALES) All right. (WHOOSHING) Take one step back. - That wasn't the rules! - My game, my rules. (GROANS, SCOFFS) Three more. Concentrate. (WHOOSHING) (GROANS) It doesn't feel right. I must be missing something. You have to make every move your own. You can do this. Well... (WHOOSHING) (WIND WHISTLING) (EXHALES) I think the next move, it would be better to blow out all the torches. (WHOOSHING) (MEN CHANTING IN HINDI) (RUMBLING) (CHANTING CONTINUES) (RATTLING, CLATTERING) (SCRAPING) Stop right there! - Chi Chi? - (GUN POWERS DOWN) Oh. I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake anyone. (CHUCKLES) Uh, no, I'm sorry. Go back to what you were doing. - No, no. I was just leaving. - YAMCHA: Hey! - (NECK CRACKS) - What are you guys doing out here? - BOTH: Nothing. - (SCOFFS) Isn't there a curfew in this temple? (CHUCKLES) Good night. - I didn't think Goku had it in him. - It's always the quiet ones. Hey, you guys are up late. - Weren't you in your room? - (BEEPING) She's got the Dragon Balls. (BULMA SCREAMS) - (SCREAMS) - Who the hell are you? (BOTH GRUNTING) - We'll find another way. - (GRUNTING CONTINUES) Chi Chi? (GRUNTS) Chi Chi! (GROANS) Help me, Goku. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! (GRUNTING) - Goku, stop! - (SHOUTS) - Oh, sh... - Wrong one. (GRUNTS) - (SHOUTS) - (GUNFIRE) - Are you okay? - (GROANS) He's alive, but barely. (INHALING DEEPLY) (STRAINING) (WHOOSHING) (MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING) Grandpa! I'm so happy to see you! - (WHOOSHING) - (GRUNTING) Wait. Are you here for me? It's not your time, Goku. There's much left to do. Grandpa, how? How do I defeat Oozaru? Always have faith in who you are. ROSHI: Kame... Hame... - Ha! - (GOKU SCREAMING) (SCREAMING CONTINUES) - (GOKU GROANING) - Pain is good. (GRUNTS, COUGHS) - (PANTING) - (BEEPING) We're too late. They have all seven Dragon Balls. Dragon Temple. That's where he will resurrect Shenlong. - Come on. - (GROANS) SIFU: Roshi? The enchantments are strong. Pray it is enough to contain Piccolo. Good luck, my friend. Namaste. (DOOR CLOSES) We will meet again on the other side. (MEN CHANTING IN HINDI) (EXHILARATING MUSIC PLAYING) - YAMCHA: Now, where am I going? - Dragon Temple. We have to get there before the eclipse. Imagine being shackled so tightly that every atom in your body stood compacted, still. That was my hell... for 2,000 years. (ENGINE ROARING) With this Dragon Ball, I take my vengeance upon the Earth. (WHOOSHING, RUMBLING) (GASPING) (GRUNTS) (RUMBLING) GOKU: Come on! Let's go! I hope you're not trying to impress me. I wouldn't mind. But I'll settle for scaring the crap out of you! Whoo-hoo! Whoo! I have to stop him before he finishes the prayer. (SHOUTS) (SHOUTS) (GRUNTS) - (SCREAMS) - (SCREAMS) - (BEEPING) - (SCREAMING) No! YAMCHA: I'm losing her! (SCREAMING) (GRUNTS) - (SHOUTS) - (GASPS) - (GROANS) - (COUGHS) (GROANING) (GRUNTS) (PANTING) (SHOUTS) (GRUNTS) (INHALES, EXHALES) (HEROIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) I'm glad to have you join me. You will bear witness to my glory when I compel Shenlong to grant me the power to rule this diseased rock. I will defeat Oozaru, and I am here to destroy you. (CHUCKLES) Defeat Oozaru?
