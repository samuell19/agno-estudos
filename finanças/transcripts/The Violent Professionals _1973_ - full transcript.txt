Up early aren't you Lieutenant? Just turning in. Cigarette? No, I'm on duty sir. Oh be daring, come on. Thanks. What about you Giamba? What's a nice guy like you doing out at this hour? They're transferring three convicts to the federal pen down in Luca. Hazardous duty Lieutenant. That bonus looks great when you have all those mouths at home. Yeah right. Well don't work too hard. Hello to your wife when you see her. Have a good sleep Lieutenant. You hear about that captain in Milano? Strangled by a couple of kids. Glad I've only got four years left to go. Better than 10. Talk to me about retiring. Mm hmm. I tell you I bought 25 acres over in Tuscany? No kidding. Olive trees vineyards lots of chickens. I was born on a farm and that's where I'll die on a farm. You worried about three harmless punks son? Wait till you find yourself with a load of riding lifers. Then do your worrying. What do you want? I got to pee. What's the matter with you? We just left the station. Couldn't you have gone then? Go on. Hey do I have to go in there and take it out for you? It's a little tricky I usually use my right hand. We're getting the fuck outta here! Come on move it! Mother fucker! Come on, come on! Come on! Come on! Miss Biagini tells me you're always fooling around. But it's Franco and Gioberte's fault. They're always getting me in trouble. Mm hmm. And you never do anything huh? Hmm. Who are they Papa? I don't know honey. Morning what can I do for you? Papa! Papa! Get in the back! For god's sake shut her up! Damnit! For Christ sake cut it out! Do it. Come on huh! Shoot her! God damnit kill her! Yeah hello. Who is this? Morning sir. She's over here in the car. You inform the DA? Not yet. Lieutenant. They think they've found 'em. They wanna flush 'em out. Girardi Casaldi. Come on out with your hands up. You got one minute. I'm with the Steppa. How'd you find them so quick? You'll get a promotion for sure if you handle this one right Lieutenant. Repeat the ultimatum in 30 seconds. Right. You have 30 seconds to go 30 seconds. Come on out with your hands in the air. We're coming out. Hold your fire okay? Throw down your guns. I said throw your guns down you hear me? That bonus looks great when you have all those mouths at home. Your time's up. My God he killed him! Would you stand back please? But they had their hands up. They were armed. You know if the Lieutenant fired it means the Lieutenant had to fire. You shouldn't have done it. All right so I overstepped the line. But you weren't there to see. Seven year old girl. Six police officers everyone with a family to support. Tell me who the hell is gonna support them now? Get out of the force Giorgio you're not meant for this kind of work. I had you transferred to a quieter city hoping you'd... You shot those men out of vengeance not out of a sense of duty. The book was thrown at'em they were lifers Johnny. What more was there for us to throw? Load them back on the train? Give them dinner offer a cigarette a coffee? Is that what I should'a done? I pulled every string I could for you. I got you out of that town and had you assigned to temporary duty here in Milano. But as for the investigation there's nothing I can do. It's already started. I'll be okay don't worry about it. There's people that'll swear those guys were about to shoot me. Sure. Those people are just what makes me worry. Too many of us are beginning to think the way you do. What gives criminals the right to shoot cops then? You're rationalizing Giorgio. We've got to work within the law. I'm into something big right now. This long string of robberies across northern Italy. Well? 12 months a sweat. Using the little gray cells. Not this. They're as good as booked. You haven't changed a bit Del Buono. You're nuts. Or a saint. Come on we all want our hour of glory don't we? Why don't you join us for dinner tonight? Can we make it tomorrow? I'd kinda like to see Milano tonight. After all that time in the sticks. Okay. Ciao. He's been shot! It was him! Come on get somebody to help! Come on! Quick get an ambulance! Hurry help! Do not therefore in this moment of pain and remorse become so tempted toward unreasoned reaction as to defy the spirit of law and justice so dear to the very person we pay homage to this sad day a symbol to the people of Milano and to all of us his work should be honored as befits him. It is with these sentiments and with confidence in your continuing faith in the ideals of democracy freedom and human rights that I and the entire nation share in your deep sorrow. Signed by the Minister of the Interior. Pathetic. Headlines top of the news for a week or two. A splendid official funeral. And then the articles become smaller and stuck amongst the ads. Yeah I was his protege. His nuisance as you told him. He had a saying. The best part of the law is that it's there. And you know what they call the man? Finest cop in the world the wrong world. Symbol. In two or three months we'll have completely forgotten there ever was a symbol. We'll even come to forget how it was that he died! Best of all though we'll forget who did it! Our system! Lieutenant you're upset I know. And understand. But don't let passion tempt you into rashness to paraphrase the minister. The hell with the minister. Giorgio... Calm down Lieutenant. I am sure that in a few days this momentary... Yes this momentary. It's bound to pass I know. Like it will for all of you. Good morning sir. Was there nothing among his files? Nothing just the usual. A few house break-ins. An elderly welfare patient who threw himself out the window. Man who stabbed his wife to death. Nothing. Who's in charge of the case? The whole force. 100 people have already been pulled in. Commissioner's given us carte Blanche. We've got to get him. No buts about it we've simply got to. Look. This wasn't just some common cop shooting. It was organized. Get me in on the case. Should have given you this three days ago. Some policeman I am. Thank you. He warned me that I would be suspended because my methods are normal. Don't worry you'll hear from me. So will you. Ciao.Ciao. My husband never talked about his work when he was home. It stopped at the front door. Yeah I know how he was. But are you sure he didn't say something the last few weeks? You know like about a place or was there anybody he mentioned that you recall? I don't know I just don't. Did he like go out in Milano for example? No not that I know of anyway. Last month or two did he come home every night? Yes sometimes very late but... He come home drunk? Well when you go into a bar to get information you're bound to have a drink. Well I believe I did smell whiskey on his breath once. This asking for you to remember I know it's jousting like some Don Quixote. But it's the only way. That one night. When he came in. Did he say anything? No like I told you his rule was very precise. He never broke it. Hmm I know I know. But he must have said something, something meaningless even like "I didn't eat" or "You don't know the crummy life a cop has" or "I smoked 50 cigarettes today". Or even "Wouldn't you know it?" "I went bowling tonight." If he did I just don't... Can't recall. I felt so empty inside ever since it happened. Empty. How about Sundays? Oh he liked to go to the movies. Up to the lakes. No just recently the last month or so. He never took off a minute. He said he had a lot to do but something was the matter I could tell. One day he walked in with mud all over his good flannels. The poor thing I asked where he'd gone. He gave a little grin and said "There's mud all over." "Unfortunately you can't avoid it." Then he gave me a bag with two trout in it. I said "Did you go fishing?" And he started to laugh said "Yes up at the supermarket." It's hard to talk under these circumstances. But so often an insignificant point can... I hope very much you'll let me try again. All I want is to avenge him. He felt you had a great career ahead and he liked you even though... Even though he said "Give Giorgio a free hand" "and he'd kick the hell out of half humanity" "and put a slug in the rest." The servant of society and society paid you back Captain. Hey look at that one. He looks like he's got... You've got good taste honey. A quickie or you wanna come home? Where do you live? Well why don't I just show you? Go down four blocks then left. You're a cutie. Come on don't be shy. And who's this? My fiance. Fiance? That's right. He never gets jealous though. You gonna keep your clothes on? Don't wanna make me happy? What do you say? How about 10? No good. All right 20. 100 but that's it. What am I supposed to say to Pepi he'll beat my ass in. That should be a fair price. Beat my ass in. He won't believe me. Jeez he's always telling me stay away from the young guys. He won't believe me. He'll beat me like he beat Peanut. She had to go and get 30 stitches. Oh he'll believe you when I talk to him. Who let him out? Stay like that. You're a gorgeous chick. Pepi. Four hours you been gone you cost me 200000 lire you bitch I'll kill you! Listen! The bastard has a gun. He's in there Pepi. You got to be real careful. There's a guy here? He robbed me 100000. I didn't have much choice he would have blown my head off! You dumb broad. Be careful. Jealous? This your car? You oughta hire some protection Jack. Keys. I usually quit at four. Hey stop whenever you want. You're the only ones in the country who don't mind working. Ciao. Hey hon you with someone new? What about old rat face? Swear to god girls this guy is one hunk. Catch anything? How's business Fish Head? It gets worse and worse. For all that shit about ecology. They're purifying the water. Goes on like this I'll be hauling out fish for real and breaking my balls and having to kiss someone's ass or worse I'll have to go back to selling trout to the wife cheaters on Sundays. Or you'll go back to fishing out of other people's pockets. The king of the prison pipeline. Water under the dam. How long were you in prison? Must be 20 years you hear any talk about me. Clean as a virgin pop I'm white as snow. Mm. The setup's changed though I understand. Could be. You're wasting your time. I'm retired now have been for years. What do you think you're doing? Up or down? Let go you crazy son of a bitch! What do you want? I drive cars. You with any fuzz? I don't give a shit! I'm on good terms with the police! Help he's killing me he's killing me! You'll get a piece of my action. Pull me out! 20% will probably get you a new rowboat. Eh? I'm drowning! I'm drowning help! Help! Help I'm drowning! Are we agreed? Let me outta here! Yes or no? Yes yes you son of a bitch! You're precious and maybe not so dumb. Bastard. Hmm. Another game of 10? You're down 20 already. You're gonna lose your shirt 'cause you're too bad to be a hustler man. Oh I got plenty of shirts. And the 20000? Okay I owe you 20. Lend me 40,000 if I win the debt's gone. You know where we shove a cue up guys like you? No show me where. You learn something new every day. Mother fucker! That's no way to treat a billiard cue. How much does he owe? 20000. I'll play for him. Now you don't owe anyone anything. You can go. But make sure you don't come back. We all have our specialty. The usual. I have homework to do I'll see you fellas tomorrow. I'd like a whiskey. Watch it. They're flying low. I know mister billiards. But I'm interested in playing. You are eh? Go home kid you're out of your league. No I'm not. Ah. Billiards is a very difficult game. Takes a good eye steady hand and a sense of logic. Excuse me. Everyone has a right to know what they're getting for their money. Try me. As what? Driver. I like taxis. Eh with this traffic you're bound to need a driver sooner or later. The things I need never come up to me and say here I am take me. It's always me that goes after them. Goodbye. Goodbye. Let's go. Keep your goddamn hands off the merchandise! Pox on thy servant that his humble hands should dirty you. You will excuse the glove. Of course my dear countess. You're the worst actor I've ever seen. Stay outta trouble huh? My name is Giorgio. Mine's not. Ah. I don't always come on this way with chicks. Just when I'm in a little trouble over at the bar. Put whatever Prince Valiant had over there on my bill too. Son of a bitch really did just want his bill to get paid. If you don't like the color I'll get you another one okay? Where'd you get that monster? In the road. With the proper tools it's merely a question of taste. Come on get in. You know I've never been in one of these monoliths before. I don't see what's so hot about it. Looks like a water buffalo. Well if you don't like it we can always get out and walk. Oh well why look a gift car in the mouth? So you dropped out of high school. Yeah well when your philosophy professor's trying to feel you up all the time you know what I mean when a guy can't even get it together to keep his own head straight he's supposed to understand all the problems of the world? But if you wanna get promoted... And so I thought gee if your ass is so good do something with it. So I went to work. You know for one of those what the hell was the name? Anyway one of those nudie rags. Ex-Student? Ex-Model? Yeah because you get in that kind of business it sorta tends to end up giving you a social conscience. That's right. You think you're a slave you feel like you're being taken. And they all say hey dummy what's there to fight? You're making 35000 per session. Look if you don't like it pack your ass. Go to Russia where you have to show it for free to the party you know? All the world's a toilet as Shakespeare said. Shall we have another round of beer? Yeah let's do. Two beers s'il vous plait. Well if you can't find heaven in the Kremlin there's always Mao. Hmm come on fella I'm way ahead of that Mao crap. Only choice left is to striptease for President Nixon. So what you gonna do? You put your ass on the line by protesting. Violence. You know Maria X I wouldn't mind a little violence with you. What'd you call me just then? Maria X. You don't like it? You got a short memory. X ex that ex this. Hmm it's true. Even names are just a load of crap. I mean look at me I was named after the holy virgin. Where to? Keep going straight. Oh what's this? Leaving clues behind? What? Yeah looks like we're being followed. What you have guardian angels? If they were cops they'd have pulled us over by now we'd be on our way to a six month stretch for car theft. So cops they're not. Maybe they saw me with my fiance. That kid at the pool hall? Who is he Al Capone? Hm yeah yeah. How about Giorgio who's he? You haven't said what Giorgio's story is. I'm the chief of police. Hmm.Hmm. What do you care? Think of me as someone who likes to take girls like you for joyrides. What did you want with Padulo? You know mister billiards? I've noticed him. Joyrides are always a lot more pleasant when you can afford them. A person that knows told me they needed someone like me for work. And what's this someone like? Hey come on now you're giving me the third degree. This is where I live right there the old homestead. Hey who are you anyway Onassis's daughter? House of Angels hmm? Heaven's a mansion? Yes but they don't let you in to this heaven unless you come to sin. Then I'm home. Come on. Shall we find somewhere else? Yeah another address. If you would like to screw me this is where I'm screwed. Look little Miss Muffett I'm not too particular about where I get laid but I prefer Mary five fingers to this. What the hell's eating you? Forget it. Son of a bitch. Talk about getting the short end of the stick. That punk spends the whole night scoring while we sit out here trying to keep our asses from getting frostbite. I think the boss is too careful. I could tell right off he was just a jerk out for a couple of thrills. Mm. Let's take off. He ain't coming out of there before dawn any way you look at it. It's all gonna run as smooth as silk but bear one thing in mind. This bird always flies at low level and there could be a slip up somewhere. Now you've got guns. They're not just to make you look tough. If you got to use 'em use 'em good. We want bread not a massacre. That's right. Here's your two elephants. He's just a punk. He stole a Rolls. Went home with the chick. Ah. All right. Go to work boys. But don't rush anything. Wait til they're closing. We'll make it worth your while. Let's go. You think they can hack it? It has an output of four watts but don't use it because it's against the law. How come you sell it then? Because selling it isn't against the law. You just can't use it because you see it can tune in the police bands with it and... Oh come off it you mean you can really... And all you do is push down this button a moment eh? Attention all area 17 units. Hey that's not funny come here. I have a condition red up at 400 Corso Mate. Hey hey fella! Attention priority call to all patrols in area 17.

No Goddamn grenades! Goddammit they're right on our tailpipe step on it! Rush it will ya? I am I am! For God's sake. Come on floor it!

Doesn't anyone ever come in here during the daytime? Yeah you did didn't you? Hmm. Drink this it dis-intoxicates. Hey. Lousy high I guess? My eyes always start watering. I didn't realize you loved that boy so much. That pineapple they were carrying they shouldn't have thrown it. It was enough to take the girls the police weren't coming... Stop it okay? Think I'll cut out. Seems I'm in the wrong dream. Oh your honor now come on don't be nervous. No one will bother us here lover. It'll be an awful lot easier if you relax a little. Mamma Mia!

Open up we know you're in there. Line forms at the rear pal. You Cartiglia? Sorry we don't want any. The sign says Pepi Cartiglia. You still believe what you read how naive. You're very humorous now let's see your ID. Piper picked my peck of pickles. You know you are hanging off the strap and right through the turnstile. What's he muttering about? His purse of course. It was lifted off him on the subway. Hmm.Hmm. An excellent knowledge of the world of pickpockets. Those pickles there are new. All right fella let's go. I get it back right? Stop stalling. Tell the guy. Hey just a moment let me finish dressing I mean... We got clothes for you where you're going. Ciao my love big kiss to his honor. Let's go let's go. Come on. Nighty night. Hey take it easy! I warned you. They're flying low. Would you believe he took us for a couple of plainclothesmen? Either we put on a pretty good show or Captain Marvel here is strictly amateurville. You don't seem the curious type. Doesn't pay. You a friend of Cartiglia's? Not exactly. Then what were you doing in his house? Watch it. They're flying low. I gave you the score the other night and hell if you don't have a job what do you do sit around and read what the papers say on inflation? What's he muttering? That he's a part-time pimp. You make it sound so so unhealthy. She was a nice clean girl. I hear you're pretty good with a car. Let's take a look. Okay what can you do? Okay now make a U-turn. Very good. You drive well. Now they're all amateurs. The thing I need is a man of your experience. No risks. You just go on driving like that and you'll be okay. The first thing I need is the money. Even if I have to go half with the boys. You understand? You're buying yourself a Swiss watch but first you got to wind it. I understand. Here's half now half after. Thank you. You don't have to count it now you got plenty of time later. What's the score? He's in. Upstairs. What do you mean you win because your ace is a spade? Suits don't count in this game you jerk! They have a blackjack game going. Pass the time you know. How much longer before we move? That's not for me to say. We move when we get the word. This is your room. Very elegant huh? I'll take it. Now take your clothes off. Underwear everything. What for? Hey they're flying low. We must keep everything harmless. This apartment's rented under a phony name. No labels or anything like that. And you're keeping your name a secret yeah. So when the fuzz pick us up that's gonna make a difference? Okay I'm ready. What are we preparing? A hold up or a war? All you have to do is drive and leave the rest of it to us. It's too late now to have second thoughts. Listen they may be flying low but I'm freezing my cubes off. You'll find some other clothes in there. You'll get these back later. Mm do what you want with 'em. I got the bare essentials. I love when they say you cannot live on bread alone. You can't live without it either. And with it you can be left alone. Okay boys don't step on anybody's toes. All you got to do is wait. You only leave this place to do your job. It could be tomorrow or in a month. Ciao. Look try to avoid gun play hmm? You let us worry about it. You stay here where it's nice and quiet. And try to remember not to reverse until we're coming out. Yeah I got it. For a professional you seem to be pretty uptight kid. All right let's go. I'll take care of the watchdog. Excuse me you got a light? I lost my lighter. Freeze everyone. Hands in the air! Don't move a muscle or you're dead! Hold it up against the wall! Put it up! Go on move it! Stop right there move back! This one's full take it. Don't move you! Are you crazy? Out! What's she done? Move! Man. Now let's see you get this buggy going. Police! Keep your cool fellas. Watch it here comes another up ahead! Jesus step on it! Bothers. I should have massacred every last one in there. There's no one to have set off no alarm then. Now they'll have roadblocks set all over the place. Goddammit. Hold your fire Carl! Don't shoot! Chicken-ass bastard! I bet you shit in your trousers too eh? You shouldn't have done it. She didn't mean nothing. You got her right in the belly she was pregnant you bastard! Society's got to start wanting a new order. The goddamn public opinion is our target! It ain't the money it's the idea you dumb asshole! They should put someone like you in a cage. Filthy butcher. Killing a woman for pleasure, animal. You pay attention to your driving or I'll take this sten and turn your head into a hole. Sure. A bank nice and cool and simple you said. A matter of driving a car. For a bunch of animals. Just keep on driving. See you make your goddamn getaway huh? Yeah and you just pray that that cat up there likes us. Oh Jesus. Shut up will ya? Come on, come on! Show us your stuff! I sure as hell hate to admit this but you drive damn good. Calling car 46 they're heading toward the magenta gate. Try to intercept them. I've got aerial 11 units moving in... Car 33 they're heading back downtown. Repeat they're heading back downtown. You might be able to set up a cutoff. Yeah? Yeah don't worry I will. Ciao. To all units they're heading downtown. Attention all units all units. They have just turned into the street headquarters is on. Attention all... Crazy goddamn fool! No don't kill him don't kill! You blasted idiots. I risk my neck to bring in a vital witness for questioning and you go and gun the man down for me! We had to he'd have mowed down half the force. Yeah I know I know. Still got the other two haven't you? They don't have as much as I do they just robbed a bank. 17 minutes ago if my watch isn't slow. You'll get yours! Somehow I'm doubtful I'll get a medal for what I've done. Who can tell? At least they'll reverse your suspension. Listen what do you say to staying in Milano in my office? I'd only give you trouble and anyway this moving around on my own I've acquired a taste for it. The truth of it is I did put our commissioner wise to everything. Those guys aren't just petty criminals. The head of their outfit has another goal entirely. You've gotten way beyond me. What is it you want? Avenge Del Buono. Afterward... You think you'll get there playing gangster? Why not man? Seeing as a pig I'm a failure. Well as far as I'm concerned whatever you want, you can have it. Supper's ready to serve if you can tear yourselves away. Ah let's eat. May not get a medal but you'll get a good meal. How did it start? Leaky gas main I think. Anyone killed? Just the manager. He was closing up when it broke out. Thanks a lot.Sure. Maria X. Hey. Rise and shine. What do you want now hero? What the hell weren't you promoted to president? Well if that isn't enough don't worry. You'll soon be promoted to the great parliament in the sky. When was the last time you ate? Eating's a matter of survival hero. And this chick is tired of surviving. Oh. Sure you are. But you haven't died yet. So come on. Look if she doesn't wanna go... Ah get back in your hole. They took the baby out alive and put it in an incubator. But it didn't make it. Hey what's the matter? Don't like the beginning of the revolution? What do you want from me anyway? You know damn well they're not just thieves. What does that group want? Who's in command? You have the wrong idea. I fooled around with Giacomo yes of course I did. But it was never more than simply going to bed together. Without any bullshit. Our friend Padulo mister billiards. What's his real name? Look this isn't banner waving for the Kremlin. That group isn't subtle at all. They wanna poison the pond. They want blood confusion. But why? There's got to be a why. If you really love that boy you've got to help me. They got him slaughtered on purpose. They knew he couldn't hack it. Oh well sure it seems awfully easy to point a pistol at some old teller and say "Give me the money" but you've got to have experience and your Giacomo had none. It wasn't a need for cash. His family was rich. Then tell me why he did it! Why? He said we had to create chaos so that we could build this country all over again. He said we... There was this number he would call. Publishing house I think in Bergamo. I think it was. Where are you going? I don't know anymore. There's no need to say thank you. The next pregnant lady you run into in the street try drawing a gun and giving it to her yourself. My father caught two thieves one night he gave them time to surrender. They turned around and shot him. Yeah sure mister officer. Do call me whenever you've got another lovely bunch of photos for me to look at. Goodnight. Yes? Mr. Saluzoglia. Yes? There's a gentleman here would like to speak to you sir. Who is it? He says his name isn't important just to tell you it's your driver friend. I'll see you later. Yes sir. Send him in. We're beginning to fly very low. I beg your pardon. Are you sure it's me you wanna see? You boys never learn. I'd have thought you were smarter though. The pool king drops out of the picture as if by magic. He never was man. And the irreproachable publisher is home again. A dead end. There's no proof. But you don't know what you're saying. Press it and I'll break every bone in your hand. You're wrong signore signore... Giorgio Caneparo. It's an unusual treat to get introduced to your hangman. I'm a different sort of policeman mister... Ah but you disappeared. No matter. I'll just have to make do with castrating Mr. Saluzoglia and that's no problem at all. The only way you come out of this in one piece is talk! Who's running the show Padulo? I don't know anything. Get the police. Police police! You're crazy. Come with me. I'll cut you up so bad you'll wish that mirrors weren't invented. That one there get him out of here he's a monster! I'm with homicide down in Milano. Can I see your ID please? I haven't got it on me. Hmm well I think we'd better clear this up at the station. Alright? You know your days are numbered Saluzoglia. So start counting. You have no way to prove it! Nothing to go on! This report makes Saluzoglia out to be just about their number one citizen! Look if I confronted with those two we're holding I'll be the laughing stock of the whole damn country. Well the police are looking for proof. You think they're gonna wait? Ah first you hide things from me and then you assume I'm going to listen to you. Why should I? Actually it's you who should be arrested! For withholding evidence. Listen Commissioner. That man brought me into the gang. The man paid me to drive the getaway car. I wanted to bring him in on a silver platter that's why I didn't tell you. He's the one who got old Fish Head and the pool hall arson. Tell me what does he have to do before we can haul him in? All I have is your word Caneparo. Your word which doesn't mean a damn. What do you think this is the middle ages where barons torture serfs at will? We haven't got absolute power. Lord you haven't any. Bring me a little proof first. Proof which'll stand in court. Bring me this girl you claim can confirm everything you've told me. Then we'll see. Oh and one thing. You'll never get justice your way. That clear Lieutenant? Hey world beater the big chief give you a sore behind? Oh come on it's cool. Calling headquarters this is car 14. Excuse me. Incident area 723 repeat 723. Proceed to corner of Villa... in front of Casa Del Angeli. We have a hit and run. Victim is a woman badly injured. Condition red for ambulance. I've got a description of the car here. It's a blue let me see yes... Casa Del Angeli. I'll go with you. Come on move back please move back. Evening sir. Maria. Well. Talk about putting your ass on the line. Now you have good reason to call me Maria X. Move back please move back. Good evening Commissioner. She was the girl. 326421 and 326422. Open up. Off your asses question hour. It's interview time. It's painful to die. And painless to be dead. Is that all you've got to say? That's all. I don't know anyone in this room. Just you. You know what life imprisonment is? Every day looking in the mirror and seeing yourself once more a useless person. Only half living. No women. No freedom. Nothing. All a life sentence Isis waiting for the moment that someone reinstates the guillotine and puts bastards like you under it. You still believe in Santa Claus? That's enough Lieutenant. The prisoner can return to his cell. Please accept my apologies Mr. Saluzoglia. Call him a taxi. And for me what are you having them call an ambulance? The loony squad? Come on be reasonable. The commissioner has no evidence. He can't arrest him on your word. His word carries more weight than mine. That's what this comedy's about. Your taxi sir. Right over there sir. Take me to Bergamo. They're very unhappy with you Signore Saluzoglia. Well the hold up went wrong. I mean it can happen can't it? But they have no proof and I have an ironclad alibi. One small bullet aimed properly and no one will have to prove a thing. Yeah but it's my first mistake in three years. To make a cop the driver in a bank job isn't a mistake in our book Signore Saluzoglia. It's total insanity. The old man recommended him to me. There's no need to worry about it. If anyone was gonna talk they sure can't anymore. You can still talk Signore Saluzoglia. This is not the way to the Bergamo throughway. They wanna speak to you. Who are you? I should be your executioner. But I fixed everything. I put everything right. It was just a stroke of bad luck that's all. You almost blew everything sky high. Right at the point when time is getting ripe for us. When people are finally beginning to get fed up with the power vacuum in this so-called democracy. So what do you want me to do? Buenos Aires. The flight leaves tonight. But... Say thank you and goodbye. Goodbye.Goodbye. I'll give you a hand if you're in a hurry. I'm sorry sir but the man wouldn't... What else do you want from me? I told you. There's only one way to save your skin. Talk. If I talk, what do you think you can do? Haven't you understood yet? These things are much bigger than a man like you. Then I'll be content to drill a tiny hole in that rotten warped skull. Okay. What do you wanna know? Who shot Del Buono? A paid killer. I don't know his name. Who hired him? If I told you the pope it'd be all the same to you. Maybe you're right only I'd still like to know who ordered the killing. The orders came from above. A name. I don't know. I'm just a small cog in a very big wheel. The captain discovered the setup. Don't crap out I still need you. Don't crap out you rat! Doctor when will I be able to question him? You never will. You mean he's dead? Much worse I'm afraid. His body's alive his lungs are pumping his heart's beating but he's totally lost his brain. He may live for a few hours a week or two years it's hard to say but more like a plant. He's no longer human. Repeat the orders. Attention to all units. Ex-lieutenant Giorgio Caneparo is wanted for assault and attempted murder. An hour ago he left the central hospital in downtown Bergamo presumably headed back to Milano. Checkpoints to be set on all roads leading from Bergamo to Milano. Nicastro here. Call me at home as soon as they have anything. I don't care what time it is. See you later. Who is it? It's Giorgio Caneparo Mrs. Viviani. Just push the gate. Thanks. My lord what in the world have you done now? You've become the most wanted criminal in Milano. The bastard hit his head that's all. Mm come on. Do forgive me Giorgio but I'm really not presentable. No forgive me for busting in at this hour. I really shouldn't have. If the great white father finds out. Well he can just lump it as far as I'm concerned. Listen you hungry you wanna eat something? Yeah I'd love to thanks. Well it'll be leftovers and afterwards we'll talk. Make yourself at home eh? Great. Huh. There isn't much but Elena's pheasant is really something else. Feeding a fugitive is a serious crime. You better confess then. I wanna know everything. Start right from the beginning. Well. Captain you're the one person I can trust. Say it then. It's all a masquerade. All what? Oh I beat the guy up yeah but he's perfectly all right. I got the chief to issue a bulletin saying he'd gone into a permanent coma. We could have said he was dead but you got to be buried if you're dead and the man knows too much. He's a corpse I need alive. With this coma story his friends are relaxed and we'll have all the time in the world to get 'em to fess up. You know what I think? He knows who put the tag on Del Buono. No it's impossible. Nicastro was serious and so were the others. They'd all be up for an Oscar! Well I admit I didn't inform the others about it. You know through the proper channels. Gianni please you got to promise me. You play this one close. That group is after me and the commissioner and you are the only two that know. Sure you better not trust anyone. And then what? He put his hands between my thighs. My lord I never would have believed it. And everyone calls him doctor innocence. And what did you do? Well when they do that to you either you smack 'em or else you smack 'em you know? Well I mean for heaven's sakes in the operating room? Why not? It's more hygienic isn't it? And anyway first I really did give him a smack. And after? He really turned crimson poor guy. I guess it was the first time he ever tried. Hope I didn't give him a trauma poor thing. Finally. This is where the bullet entered. It missed the aorta by the width of a hair and then passed on through without touching any other vital organ. Another centimeter and I'd have been screwed eh? Millimeter not centimeter. You're a very lucky man. Here's breakfast for the most famous shooting victim in Italy. Enjoy enjoy.Thanks. Is he the one you discovered a little hard to operate with? How was he? It was either life in prison or the medal. Guess you lucked out. Am I disturbing you or may I? Please do. So you've gotten to the bottom. The game I'm running is for very high stakes and I want you on my side. Del Buono's vindicated. Now make sure you don't follow him Giorgio. You see the way things have gone downhill. The people respect the order only when you force them. Right this moment I'm not up to forcing 'em. I know your sentiments lie with us. There is one and only one way to break down violence. Use it all the more! Just the way you did. And every sane person in the country is on your side and on our side. That fellow who killed Del Buono and you killed in turn. Hmm. Pretend you'd put him in prison. Two years waiting to come to trial a year for the trial then he would appeal to a higher court. Look in 10 years at most he would have gone free. Assuming there'd have been witness with enough courage to actually say yes it was him. On the other hand when there's a corpse involved every coward grows more courageous. Us you're always saying us. But us who? One thing at a time Giorgio. It was unavoidable your murdering Del Buono? Unavoidable. He found out too much and then refused to join us. I used to tell him man you're either nuts or a saint. Yeah why not both he would answer and you know he was right. When do you get out of here? Doctor mentioned a week. You will support us won't you? You realize your support is extremely important to us now. We're badly in need of heroes. The minute they release me count me in all the way. I knew you'd see everything my way. And you'll be glad you did. Ciao.Ciao. Some more cables on your appointment came today. Congratulations happy to hear about it good wishes fantastic honor. From every country on the continent. Hmm. Hmm. Aren't you glad sweetheart? One whole year in the Hague. It's the best thing for the cause believe me. And when we come home this rotting democracy will crumble into our hands and we'll build a new nation. Hold on. Hello? Yeah I'm flying out at eight. That's right I'll be meeting them tomorrow. Keep an eye on him though eh? You never know he's rather unpredictable. Yes I'll be back in two weeks and we can decide then. I wanna make sure everything is completely settled with him before my wife and I leave for Holland. Bye. Well wonders never cease. Our boy Caneparo is out of the hospital. Hello there. What are you doing here? I'm not gonna be your hero. Or your police force. You gonna kill me too? You're putting me on. Look I have to catch a plane. Maybe when I've come back Maybe you won't though. Every departure is a small death. Calling headquarters this is Viviani speaking. I'm on the road to Linante.
