Yeah, I'm.. Matt, stop! Come on, this is ridiculous. You just need to be patient, we'll be there in a minute. Be where? Stop being an asshole. I'm not being an asshole, I just wanna know where we're going. You'll see. You tie a (Mumbles) on my head and then say, "Oh, let's see were we're going." Would you knock it off? We're almost there. Where? It's a surprise. I hate surprises. Okay. Is this it? No, it's not. Get out of the car. This is a rest stop, actually. We're here! When do I get to take this thing off? Take it off. Tada! Whose house is this? It's ours! What do you mean it's ours? It's, it's our house. No, we can't afford a place like this. Sure we can, we can afford the utilities. No, seriously, we can't. You don't wanna start a family now? Just gonna blow everything on a house. Listen, I had an appointment with a lawyer on Wednesday and I didn't tell you about it. Please tell me you didn't sign something. Well, listen, it's my mothers house. Your mother? My birth mother. But you said you didn't know your birth mother. I don't. Well, she died a few weeks ago and her estate lawyer tracked me down, and she gave us this house. You feel like a dick now, don't you? Shut up. Listen, it's free and clear, no mortgage, it's just ours. Well, um, okay. I mean, aren't you happy? Uh, I guess. Still a dick. Shut up, Silas. It's just, uh, it's a lot to take in. Jesus, this place is huge. Well, come on, let's go inside, come on. All right. You knew? Yeah, I knew. Why would she tell you? Because he'd say no. Yeah, pretty much. You ready? Yeah. This is the study, which will be my office. Her office. And this is the dining room for entertaining. Living room. Oh, I could live with this. Yeah. You see this TV? Not too shabby. Not bad at all. What about the couches? What about them? Well, you're not keeping them, are you? Why not? What, you live in the '80s? They're pleather. I mean, we can replace them later but for now, I guess, they're fine. What? Rach? What's wrong? Oh my god, I had this same music box when I was a kid. Oh my god. Isn't that crazy? Yeah, crazy. Look at this thing. Hey, Matt. So, how do you feel about our new house? I like it. Yeah? Like, you like it like it, or it's like okay? It's great, what... Why are you recording? Because it's our new house, it's important. But you don't have to do it all the time. No, yeah, it's our first house, it's a big deal. You're such a dork. No, I'm not. I still love you. I better get a fire started. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hey everyone, it's Rach. Say hi. Hey. Come on. All right. Okay, so, you might be a little confused as to where we are. Yup. But this is our new house, surprise. You're gonna get a little annoyed with us by all of our posting that we'll be doing, but don't worry, you will be all invited to the house warming party. You smell that? Yeah. It smells like, it smells like rotten egg or something like that. What, no, it doesn't smell like rotten eggs. You know what, the fire went out, hold on. Oh. Probably just wasn't used in a while. Yeah. Come here. What? (Mumbles) Oh my god! Matt, what was that? Huh. What are you doing? I'm gonna go look. No, don't go out... Stop, don't go out there. It's fine. Matt, come on. Just wait. The screen's all torn up. What is that noise? I don't know, it's an animal or something. What kind of animal sounds like that? I don't know, I'm not an animal expert. It's the woods, it's what happens. I don't like the woods. It's not a big deal, relax. Did you lock it? Thank you. Welcome. Where are you going? I have to take out the trash. No, Matt, just leave it. No, something smells, I'm gonna get rid of it. Ugh, don't go out there. Matt! Do you want me to just leave this in the living room? Well, no, just put it outside the door and.. The trash can's right there, I'll be right back. Matt? Yeah? Okay. Why is the window open? Oh my god! What? Why did you do that? You called me. Matt, the wind... There was a bang, and the window. What about the window? Like, look at the blind, they was open, I just shut the window. Well, why'd you leave the window open? I didn't. Are you sure you didn't? Hmm, like, kinda. Uh huh. Look, I know it's gonna take some getting used to. You're living in the woods, there's lots of noises. That didn't sound like an animal. Well, have you heard a lot of animals in the woods before? No. Yeah, it's new. Look, I'll call Silas tomorrow, I'll get him to hook up those cameras, you'll get used to it, okay? Fine. It's not funny. It's a little funny. It's not! You're always getting freaked out by anything. I didn't do that. Well, you sure? Yes, I'm pos... I just walked down here, I would've hit my head on the thing. I mean, I would've too, but... It's probably just an old spring or something like that. Let's check it out tomorrow. Relax. No, Matt, I don't like that. This house is creeping me out. Okay, so, I just have to show you this. We have a beautiful double oven, which means everyone is invited over for Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Easter, right, Babe? What? What? What are you doing? I'm documenting our new house. You're gonna do this all day? I can't work until I have wifi, and the cable guy is coming over this afternoon. Oh, right. So, I'm working late so do you want me to pick up dinner? No, we have a beautiful new kitchen and I'm cooking. Oh. I can cook, Matthew! Oh, I'm sure you can. Prove it. You jerk. Okay, I see you. Great. Okay, so how do I switch between the cameras? Just press the icons. Do we really need seven of these? It's a big house. Yeah, but do people normally have that many? Normally they put one in the door, and if they have kids or pets, they put one inside. Yeah, normally. Well, this should make her feel better. Yeah, I mean, she's just nervous. You know, she's always lived somewhere with lots of people around. You remember the neighborhood she grew up in, and at the apartment there was always all those people, and I'm working late, so living out here in the woods is gonna take some getting used to for her. Well, this covers the whole exterior of the house so anything that moves, you'll get (Mumbles) notification actually. Is there anyway to record all this? Yeah, actually, we use a company that stores it up to a cloud, it's used for residential monitoring and stuff. All right. Look, how expensive is this gonna be? Don't worry about it. No, seriously. Consider it a house warming gift. No, you went through all this trouble, these things are obviously pricey, what do I owe you? Nah, these are from an Air Guard Base, they were gonna throw them in the trash. So, my house warming gift is garbage? I can take them back if you want. No, no. Look, I appreciate it, I really do. Just in case, not now, but you know, in the future, do you have anymore for inside? Yeah, I've got about a dozen more if that will make you feel better. It might, not today, but you know.. Okay. Just in case. They work at night too, actually, they're military grade, like I said, off the air guard base, so they shoot in green, not gray. Cool. Makes it a lot easier to see. Yeah, I mean, she's uneasy about living out here, but you know, she's also getting a little freaked out. She thought she heard somebody inside the other night, but you know, I think it's just the cat or something. You're in the woods now, you're gonna hear a bunch of stuff outside. Oh, no shit. Well, just show her a recording of a raccoon or a possum, it will make her feel better. Yeah, I guess so. And if you want me to put one in the bedroom, I can monitor you guys, see if you have a healthy relationship. Yeah, I'm good, I see what you look at online, you asshole. What's so funny? Nothing. Nothing. Yeah, Si's just showing me how these cameras work. You think I'm crazy, don't you? Yeah, but not because of the cameras. Nice. Sorry, man. Hey everyone, it's Rach. Things have quieted down a little bit. I'm just... Still recording. Yeah. Why? I don't know, Matt, I'm by myself. You don't have anything else to do? No, Matt, I don't have anything else to do because it's night and I'm home by myself because you are working nights. Well, what do you want me to do? I have to work. I'm.. Look, we got this house, it's great. I love it, but I told you, when they call me for work, I'm gonna have to go because we can't afford the utilities. Matt, I understand but there, I'm hearing things. Okay, I'm hearing things outside. You need to check the cameras. I'm gonna check the cameras. I just got in, all right? I'll check the cameras, we'll see some deer, we'll see some raccoons, it will be great. Send it to Discovery Channel, I don't know what you want. Matt, it does not explain the things that I am hearing in the house. I'm hearing, I'm hearing footsteps, Matt, and the door is slamming upstairs, and the light is going on and off, and Matt, I'm hearing voices, Matt. Yeah, Baby, I know. I know what you think you're hearing, it's fine. You're here, you're alone, it's a big house, you're out in the middle of nowhere, things are outside. I don't think I'm hearing these things, I'm hearing these things. Look, I'll call Silas, I'll have him come back, same cameras that he installed outside, I'll have him put them inside. He said he can do that. I'll get them hooked up to my phone. I can be sitting at work, I can see every square inch of the house. You'll see there's nothing going on, it's all in your head. Did you just say it's in my head? Matt, you're not home, you're not here when this stuff is happening. All I'm saying is you're by yourself, it gets noisy outside, you've got a camera running, you're freaking yourself out. If you drop this, you'll see, not a big deal. Nothing's going on. Okay? I'll call Silas in the morning. Yeah, Matt, are you sure she's home? No, I banged like seven times. Yeah, doorbell, too. All right. Yeah, no, I'll wait. All right, all right, bye. Did you hear me? Looks good. (Mumbles) for the basement, do you mind opening it? No, just wait until Matt gets home. I can open it right now. Just wait. I'll just take the doorknob off. No. Yeah, how far out are you? No, she won't let me in the basement. Yeah. You ask her, I don't know. All right, all right, yeah, bye. He's just a few minutes away, Rach. Great, then you guys can keep talking about me behind my back. Whatever, Rachael. Don't whatever me, I'm not imagining this. Look, if you hate it so much here, just sell the place and stop making Matt miserable. You're miserable. Miserable? I'm making him miserable, is that it? Yeah, I guess. Well, is that what he told you? I don't know, Rachael. You don't want him to work late, you're miserable, that means he's miserable. What do you want from him? What is that smell? I'm burning a candle. Are you burning a shit candle? No, it smells good, it smells like perfume. Uh, it smells like ass. Well, maybe it's you. Uh, I don't wear anything that smells horrible. Hmm, too bad. What was that? Nothing, the ladder fell, relax. Don't tell me to relax! Oh my god, stop being such a pain in the ass! Thank god! What's going on? So I make you miserable? Dude, what the hell? Dude, your wife's crazy. Yeah, you don't get to talk about her that way. Do you smell this shit? Yeah, I smell it, I don't know where the hell it's coming from, it's in the duct work or something, it comes and goes. Yeah, well, she thinks it's perfume. Well, look, you got another camera to put up? Yeah, just one more in the basement. All right. Do you have the key? What key? Uh, are you screwing with me? What are you talking about? Can you put it in here? Yeah, I'm gonna need an extension cord though. All right, I'll go get one. All right. Ah, shit! Si? What happened? Dude, something bit me! Silas hurt his hand, what now? What? I didn't hurt my hand, something bit me! Something didn't bite you, you probably got (Mumbles) nail or something like that. This is a bite mark, that's not from a nail! You got rats down there or something. No, go into the office. I've never seen a rat. I don't like rats. Are you mad at me? What do you think? I think you think I'm crazy. Just eat. Listen, I'm not imagining things. Do you think that Silas imagined that bite? Can we just eat? Something's out there. Hold on. It's a dog. Eat. I'm not hungry. Smell this. Rachael! I'm eating. But listen, this is what I've been smelling, it's my mothers perfume, I found it in her stuff. That's not, that's not what I've been smelling. Well.. No, what I've been smelling smells disgusting, like sulfur, or eggs, or something, I don't know. Well, I'm smelling this, and listen, I think, I think my mothers ghost is in this house. Matt? Where are you going? Out. Matt! Matt, just please call me back, okay? Mom? (Foreign language) Is that you? (Foreign language) What do you want? (Foreign language) Mom? (Foreign language) Hi. Look, did you see that? The chair just moved. Yeah, I see it, but I don't believe it. Is that you? Oh my god, who is that? I mean, it got really cold and I heard voices and the lights went out and... Oh, god. Who is that? (Foreign language) Do you hear that? (Foreign language) What language is that? I, I don't know. (Foreign language) I am so sorry, I never should have left you alone. I'm sorry. Look, look, we gotta get in touch with that attorney, the guy that told you about the house the first time. Okay. Mr. Teller? Jason, you must be Matt. I am. Hi. Hey, (Mumbles). Yes, hi, thank you so much for coming, really. So, as you can see, we kind of left the place the same way it was, just like when my mother had it. Actually, I've never been here before. Oh. Really? Yeah, your mother never let anyone in here, as far as I know. I mean, I thought she was a hoarder. The house is very nice though. Can I get you something to drink? Water would be great. You were Rachael's mother's attorney for 30 years? No, no, I, um... Thank you. I've been practicing law for about six years and my father was her attorney. When he retired, I took over the practice. Did I not tell you that? It never came up. So, you were pretty vague on the phone. Is there something I can help you with? Jason, this is gonna sound a little strange. Do you believe in ghosts? Uh, no. I mean, you wouldn't find me in a cemetery walking around at midnight, but no, not really. How well did you know my mother? Not very well, personally. I spoke to her on the phone a few times, she was sort of a recluse. My father was her lawyer for, I don't know, over three decades and I think he only saw her in person like five times. Can we talk to him? My father? He passed two years ago. Oh, I'm sorry. No, he had a great life. Why are you asking me if I believe in ghosts? We're a little crazy. It is an unusual question, but there must be a reason you're asking. Well, there have been some strange things happening. So, most of them are happening to Rach, but.. Like what? Well, voices when no one else is here, footsteps in the middle of the night, stuff is moving around. I was hoping that you knew my mother better and maybe she said something to you about it. Well, like I said, I only spoke to her a few times, but the last conversation I had with her was a little strange though. How so? We hadn't spoken in over a year. She called and asked if all her affairs were in order. She said she felt as if she were going to die, which is strange since she was only 50 years old and sounded fine. What did she die from? This is a great house she left you. Yeah, we like it. We'd like it a lot more if we knew what was going on, though. Listen, it's a new house, new space, you just have to learn what the sounds are. You know, sooner or later you'll figure out that it's just the pipes in the wall or something. Can I show you something? Sure. So, I work nights, Rach is alone by herself most of the time. She gets nervous so we had some cameras installed. Mom? Is that you? (Foreign language) Whoa. I don't think that's pipes in the walls. How did you get this video? Well, it was recorded here, in the living room, and upstairs. No, I mean, where is your recorder? Like, how is it on the computer now? It records through the cloud, we downloaded it right afterwards and saw this. Huh, you were here the whole time, right? Yeah, that was me on video. Did you see that guy? Yeah, he was on video. No, I mean, did you actually see him? Like, when it was really happening, do... You don't react as if you saw him at all. Well, no, not when it was happening but I've heard all the voices, and the chair moved, and when we watched it later, that's when we saw him. I was out, I got the push notification on my phone that the power went out so I rushed back. The power went out and the cameras kept recording? Yeah, they all have battery backup, so they'll record even if power goes out, store the footage, then when the power comes back, they'll upload to the cloud. How long passed between the time it was recorded and the time that you watched it? I had to log in, I had some trouble, I had to call Silas for my password. Maybe an hour or two. Who's Silas? That's my friend, he installed all the cameras. Ha. I'm sorry, why do you keep doing that? Have you ever seen a T-rex walking around in the back woods here? You think we're imagining this? Look, I've never seen a T-rex either, but I saw Jurassic Park, they look real. So, you think we made this up? I'm a good judge of character, and I don't think that you made this video but someone else could have very easily. You said it took a while before you could access the video. Do you think Silas could be screwing with us? No. I mean, no. Why would he do that? Because he's an asshole. Why not ask him? I can. I will, but I mean, he wouldn't do something like this, it's not funny, it's mean. May I use the bathroom? Yeah, it's right there. Thank you. Do you remember when you proposed to me and you called Silas on speakerphone. Do you remember what he said? Jesus, Rach, he was kidding. He said, "Why'd you have to do that with her?" He knew you were in the car. No, he didn't, he hates me. He's probably watching us on camera right now and laughing. Look, yeah, he likes to pull jokes, but he wouldn't do something like this. Could you just ask him? He'd probably deny it anyway. I can ask, but the chair moving, the voices, how do you explain that? You know what's funny, Matt? When all of this first started, you said it was all in my head, and now you're the one who believes it more than I do. That smell is not from me. What smell? You don't smell that? So, sometimes there's a smell. Rachael thinks it smells like perfume. Perfume, I was gonna suggest you have your septic tank checked because I think it's backing up. Yeah, I smell something rotten. Look, is there anything else I can do for you? Rach, Jason's leaving, do you have anything else to ask? Yeah, you didn't answer our question from before, how did my mother die? Do you know? She was found at the bottom of the basement steps. Her neck was broken. After she said that she thought she was going to die. What, are you suggesting that she killed herself? I mean, it's a little weird, isn't it? I seriously doubt that she chose to throw herself down a flight of stairs to kill herself. I mean, that's a way to hurt yourself, not kill yourself. I'm just saying, you said the last conversation you had with her was pretty odd. She said that she thought she was gonna die soon and then... The conversation was a little strange, yes, but I think it was initiated by a friend of hers. Who? In your mothers will, she left a few thousand dollars to a spiritual advisor, a friend, she was named Mona. That's who you should talk to. If anybody knew your mother, it was her, Mona. So, how do we get in touch with her? Here, right your email on the back of this business card and I'll get you her contact info. Is there anything else I can do for you? What do we owe you for tonight? Please, don't worry about it. You think we're crazy. No, I just want you to figure this out so you can enjoy living in this beautiful house. Thank you so much, really, for everything. It's not a problem, not at all. Seriously though, I would check with your friend. You wanna make sure he's not messing with you. Sometimes people just take a joke too far. Thanks, I will. Who's here? Matt! And have that septic tank checked. All right, thanks. Matt, Matt! Matt! Matt! Check the video. Matt, check the video before anything changes! Matt! Matt, Matt! Matt! Nothing. Somebody attacked me. I know, but there's nothing there, nothing shows up. We know it's not Silas though. Matt, what's going on? I don't know. But you can't be here alone anymore. You have to work, how are we gonna pay the bills? I've got some vacation days saved up, when I have to go in, you can go stay with your parents. Matt, you have to call that woman tomorrow. I will, as soon as Jason gives me the number I'll call her. Right, and three egg rolls. Yeah. No, I want them for delivery. But your ad says you deliver. All right, how long will that take? Fine. Rach! Yeah? Come on, we gotta go pick up the food. Why didn't you have it delivered? I tried, but they said they don't deliver to that house. Okay, so just order from somewhere else. No, come on, let's go. Well, no, but if that lady comes while we're here, give me the keys, I'll go. No, we'll just leave a note and tell her we'll be back in a little bit, and she won't have to wait long. Okay. Okay. Do you have your wallet? Yeah. I know you're here. You need to leave these people alone. You know what's in here? Sarah, where are you? I miss you, Mona. I miss you, too, hon, but you have to crossover. Come in. I don't think they're going to appreciate my being here when they're not home. Oh, shut up, you don't scare me. Then leave! Good. You should not have let this stuff leave here. It doesn't matter now. Oh, it does, Honey, it does. That's where I'll put you. Perfect. Oh my god. Oh, your mother let me in. It was chilly out there. What's in the bag? Dinner. Oh, that's okay, hun. I ate before the taxi came and picked me up. Didn't I say I was getting her dinner? Yeah, I don't care about that, I wanna know why she's in our house. What do you want? How do we stop this? There's more. No, no, no, no, stop it. That boy in the video. Yes, yes, that's Elijah. He looks young but he's not a boy. You know who that is? I do, he is responsible for a great deal of what has happened here. Well, who is he? What are you doing? Shh. She's telling them everything. I wanted to make sure he wasn't here. Who is he? Elijah, he's your brother, I mean, he was your brother. What happened to him? He died shortly before your mother. How? Do you want to know why he is not here? Yeah. The cross, the bible, the lord's prayer, these are the things that keep him from being here. Mona, how did he die? Your mother is here, though. Now? Not here with us because she cannot bare to hear what I'm telling you. She thinks it's her fault. What is? Turn it off! It's Silas, I gotta take it. What? How do you know that? It's a woman, she knew Rachael's mother. Are you watching us in the house right now? No, her birth mother. What about those other voices? Oh, they come and they go. They call themselves caretakers. Caretakers? How many of them are there? Well, it, it varies. Right now, I believe I hear their mother, and there are a few others, family members, they've passed over, you know, but they still watch over us. Now, I want you to draw a picture of this house peaceful, in the future. What are you doing? She's drawing a picture. How about if we go into the other room and talk? I can tell that you two are stressed about this. Yeah, I mean, we just wanna know what's going on. I'm worried about Rach. Are you two okay physically? You mean are we sick or something? I mean, um, are things okay in the bedroom? We're healthy, thanks. That's important. Yeah, I don't really feel comfortable talking about this with you. Are you okay? Let me see what you've drawn. Oh, this is (Mumbles). I gotta get a picture of this, hold on. Come on, don't make fun of me, I haven't drawn with crayons since like, I don't even remember. Now I've got my glasses on, I haven't worn those in a while. It's up in the future. Would you get my bible? I see there's a kid. We've talked about it. Hmm mmm. Don't, this is good. This is peaceful. Thank you. Keep it in here. Remove those artifacts. We belong with you. This is not your home. Let us in! What are you doing? They're outside. Who? Outside, there's voices outside. Where? Well, don't go. There's nobody here. (Mumbles) I'm with you. She's not telling us everything. Who, Mona? Yeah, there's something that she's not telling us. I have to talk to her again. I can't be trapped like this! You're not trapped. I have to know the whole story. In the meantime, I don't want her coming back. And tomorrow, I'll change all the locks on the doors. Why? They don't need a key to get in. Oh, I got here as soon as I could. I need you to tell me everything about my family. That's why you asked me here? It's important, now more than ever. Matt's in a meeting tonight and he's not gonna be home until late. I told you most of what I know all ready. Most, but not all. If your mother had wanted you to know everything, she would've left you a journal. Mona, something's happening here. You're having problems with the items I returned. Returned? The cross, the Lord's prayer, the Bible. They were here before. Well, who removed them? I thought this was all over. What was over? I received a box in the mail with the items in it. It was sent by your brother, Elijah. And when I called upon your mother, she said he had died. How? Oh, it was terrible, Honey. He hung himself in the attic. Oh my god, is that why he's still here? The items are meant to keep him away. Oh, he was such a sweet boy. He got so withdrawn towards the end though, it was very sad. Why would he kill himself? Oh, Rachael, there are some things better left unsaid. No, no, you need to tell me everything. Please, I'm begging you. Those items are protecting you, they're also protecting Elijah and your mother too, until Elijah removed them. Well, why would he remove them? I cannot be certain but I'm afraid that he was convinced by something sinister. Something sinister? Like what? I can sense that this is really important to you, so I am going to tell you but I warn you, it's going to be very difficult to hear. I have to know. When your mother was very young, she was raped by her uncle. She had a child, you have an older half brother, that is why she put you up for adoption. I don't understand. To protect you from him. From my half brother? Well then why did she keep Elijah? He had no need for Elijah, it was you he needed. And once you were born, he killed your father. Oh my god, why? Is he in jail, is he still alive? Rachael, you need to keep an open mind about what I am going to tell you. Have you ever heard the story of the Leed's family? Who are they? We will kill your husband. This dates back to the 1700's. Families were much larger at that time. There was a woman called Mother Leeds, and she had 12 children. Everyone of the pregnancies was very, very difficult. And when she became pregnant for the 13th time, she cursed the child and she swore that she would not suffer through another pregnancy unless the devil himself were the father. Yeah, everyone around here knows that story. This is not folklore, this really happened. The child was born horribly disfigured. It stood up immediately after birth and it sprouted wings, and then it flew out through her window. Yeah, our parents used to tell us that story to keep us inside at night. There were witnesses, women from the town used to visit Mother Leeds, and she would bare her breast to show them the claw marks where the beast came to feed. Mona, it's just a story. What does this have to do with my family? The beast, like all living creatures, would eventually grow old and die. But to continue his bloodline, he would have to mate with a female member of the Leed's family. Mona, it's just a story. Do you want me to continue to tell it? Yes, yes, I'm sorry. After many generations, there was one last female descendant of the Leed's family. Your mother Sarah was that last living female descendant. What are you saying? I am saying that the uncle that raped her was the beast. The beast, that's what they called him? We called inbred hicks around here pineys. She became pregnant as a result, and she gave birth to a horribly disfigured child, your half brother. What happened to him? After the baby was born, he fled into the pine barons. The baby? A deformed baby survived in the forest, and then it killed my father. Why didn't he kill all of us? Because he needed Elijah to remove the items from here one day, and once Elijah did that, he convinced him to kill himself. And now, he needs you. Me? What for? To breed with. Mona, you need to leave. These pineys you speak of, they call him the jersey devil. And now that he is nearing the end of his life, and you are the only living female descendant of the Leed's family, he needs you to have his child. Mona, you need to leave or I'm calling the police. No need, I'll call a cab and wait outside. Mona, leave. You know what I put in the attic. I'll watch over them and make sure everything goes as planned. How much longer? Okay. No, I had some soup. I took a sleeping pill, I'm just gonna go to bed. Okay. All right, love you too, bye. Matt? Matt, come on, not tonight. Matt, no. Ow, Matt, no, Matt! Rach? You awake? (Mumbles) Matt. Matt. Rach. What time is it? It's quarter after three. What are you doing out here? I got home late from work, didn't wanna wake you up. Yeah, okay. Rach, Rach, you okay? What did you eat? Nothing. What happened? What? What, your back, you got scratches all over you, what'd you do? Leave. Matt, can we just talk? You need to go, Silas. I called you like 10 times. Rachael doesn't want you here, and I don't want you here. What did I do? You were spying on us. I was not spying on you! Yeah, well, how'd you see the woman in the video, huh? Because I know you work nights and the motion detector went off, and so I thought Rachael was scared. I care, that's all! Bullshit. Matt, I swear on everything I love, I was not spying on you. Why would I spy on you? I want the cameras gone, Silas. Unplug them. What about the battery? They'll die like an hour after they're unplugged, just keep them. You hate her, don't you? Of course not. I need you to go. Matt, come on. Come on, nothing. Leave. Hey. How was your nap? It was fine. Where were you? I was just taking out the trash. Oh, I thought I heard voices. Yeah, it was some guys on bikes. Did I wake you up? No, the phone did. Who called? The doctor. The doctor. Why'd the doctor call? I went to see her. I would've gone with you. No, it's fine, I just wanted to see why I've been so nauseous all the time. What'd she say? I'm pregnant. Nice. No, no. No, it's a good thing. I thought you were gonna say you were sick, I don't know, cancer or something. No, this is great, this is great. Really, you're not mad? No, no, why would I be mad? I don't know. I mean, we talked about it, it's sooner than expected but.. I thought we would try to be careful. It's fine. I love you. I love you. We're having a baby. Is that your phone? Yeah. You dork, I love you. Mona, I know you're getting these, but you just try to contact me or my wife one more time, see what the fuck happens. Matt! What? Come on, I was just telling you what happened. It has been completely peaceful here the last nine months, nothing, and then you gotta bring this shit up? Come on, I was just telling you what was happening. It's not a big deal. No, it is a big deal, I specifically said don't talk to her again. I'm sorry. Well, why is the cameras on? I don't want them on, but it's almost time. I gotta keep an eye on you. What, you think this is funny? I mean, a little bit. No. What are you doing? I'm calling her. No. Matt! Knock it off. Hey. Thanks for coming. Thanks, I didn't know who to call. (Mumbles) So, why do you gotta go in for questioning? Remember that woman? What woman? You trying to be cute? The woman from a year ago? Yeah, well, she filed a restraining order against me. A restraining order, for what? Well, we haven't seen her in months, I mean, I haven't even thought about her. But Rachael told me a story about how this lady came back after the three of us met and I wasn't here, but she told Rach the story all about how... I don't know, it's just bullshit, just stuff to freak her out. And I got mad, said some things I shouldn't have and she said I was threatening her, so. Yeah, you gonna off her or what? No, I'm just going in, answering a few questions, clearing some things up. You're not going alone, are you? Yeah. Shouldn't you bring a lawyer with you? Well, it's just a few questions, no big deal. If it's anything more than that, I'll get a lawyer. But for now, I can't really afford one. I don't know man, it's your word against hers. Yeah, I know. What are you gonna do? Hey, how far back do the recordings go? I didn't really set a limit, I mean, the beginnings I guess, besides when you unplugged them. Yeah, no, that's good. Can you do me a favor while I'm gone? Can you go, use my laptop, find the footage from when she was here. Not the first time when it was the three of us, just the time when she met with Rach. Find that and I can show that she was insane. Yeah, sure, I'll look for anything relevant. That's good, thanks. Yeah. I mean, Rach is due any day, and I couldn't leave her alone. Yeah, is she okay with me being here? Yeah, she knows. She's sleeping, so stay out here, use the laptop, if anything comes up, give me a call. You got it. Thanks. All right, I mean it, anything, just give me a ring. Yeah, sure, will do. Good luck! Thanks. (Foreign language) What the fuck is that? Matt, call me as soon as you get this. Please, it's urgent, seriously. (Foreign language) This is not your home, you are not safe here. He killed me, she must leave. I brought her here. Leave this place, he will kill your husband. She belongs here. Jesus Christ. This is insane. I know. Matt, when you coming home? Listen, man, I was going through all the footage, all of the footage, you guys need to get out of this house right now. I'm not fucking with you. Rachael? Rachael, Rachael, what are you doing? Fuck, Rachael, what are you doing? Rach! Rach! Rach, Rachael, Rachael? Rachael, wake up. What happened? What happened? Rach! I had the baby. Where's the baby? I hope you don't mind, I named him Ben. Rachael, where's the baby? He flew away. Stay here. Rachael, stay here. Elijah, you were such a cute baby. Ben! Rachael! Rachael, where are you? We're down here. Rach! Rach, where is the baby? Rachael, what is that? This is our baby. No! No, stop! Sister, what are you doing? I finished the drawing. What's that? It's me, Matt, and the baby that we wanted. And that's the baby that we got. It's done. Can I crossover now? Join us. Where are we? We're home. Okay, let's get rid of you. Oh, such a mess. Such a horrible, horrible mess. Bad, bad Ben. I know your death is only temporary, but if you should try to rise again, hopefully you will rot before that can happen! This, this ought to keep you in your place. But be warned, if you do try to rise again, the caretakers will chain you up in the basement. By the way, your parents are being cremated. I'm going to put their ashes in the attic, and I'm taking the recliners. No, it looks really good, but you have no idea what bids other people are placing. I took a bunch of pictures. No, the outside, they won't let you inside, I wish they did before we placed the bid. Yeah, I'm gonna place a bid, yeah. I don't know, it makes me nervous because it's gonna take every penny I got, but you know the plan's not to keep it, it's to buy it, flip it, make a profit, move onto the next one. Auction's next week. 30 days after that. All right, dude, wish me luck. Yeah, thanks, I'll send you some pictures. ♫ Wake up to another day ♫ Repeat the same mistakes ♫ Just like yesterday ♫ Splash water on my face ♫ To wash away the taste ♫ The visions of your face ♫ Don't you know it feels so good ♫ Holding onto what we once had
