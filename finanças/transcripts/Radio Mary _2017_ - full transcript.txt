I'm sorry. - Are you mad at me? - No, of course not. Are you alright? You seem like you're a little shaky. Yeah, something really weird just happened. Really? What? There was this guy in the elevator, and he he touched my shoulder. Touched your shoulder like in a creepy, intentional way? Yeah, I think so. - That's sexual harassment, you know. - I know. You should talk to the building manager. They can... I just sort of want to forget that it happened. Okay. Well uh, I have to go to a meeting - so I'll see you later. - Okay. Bye. - Excuse me. - Excuse me. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Mary. Mary, you'll stay at my house for as long as you like. Okay? You're freezing. What did they put me on? I don't remember a name. Something to calm you. Do you need anything? I just need to rest. I don't understand what happened. What do you think happened? I think a strange man touched my shoulder and then I felt strange. What felt strange? I felt like I could hear what he was thinking but he wasn't moving his lips. Do you think telepathy is real? What do you think? It felt real at the time, but I don't know. Has this ever happened before? What? - Hearing thoughts. - No. Can you hear thoughts now? No. Do you see any connection between what happened in the elevator and what happened in the bathroom? Yes. I think one thing led to the other. What are you thinking about right now? What if I get disoriented again? - Are you afraid that might happen again? - Mhmm. Yes. paint our faces blue like clowns the washing again. caramel butterscotch. apples in your crumble? she make cheesecake? in their house, but who cares? Feeling well? No, I'm fine.

Bye. Mary. Got a storyline for you, Tony. How'd you get in here? It could be a book or a movie... or an apocalyptic mini-series. I didn't invite you in. My story's about a virus. You get infected just from getting touched. Alright, that's very interesting and um... Here's a nifty twist. There's no protection from this virus. There's no brain condoms. Look, can you please just go on home okay? And if you want to set up a meeting with me... Relax, Tony. Don't just talk to fill dead air. maybe I'm not here. That's a great idea, it's... great.

So what if I have seen him? If this guy's real, then it's a police matter. Have you seen him? No, I haven't seen him. What's bothering you, Mary? I've just been having bad dreams. I had a bad dream about the man, and then I woke up and I was scared. What did the man do in your dream? Just weird dream stuff. When you woke up how did you feel? What?

Okay. - I'll see you later. - Alright. Hey. Lunch? - I'm sorry, what? - How about lunch? This is taking a lot longer than I expected it to. I think I'm gonna skip it. - Okay. - Okay. Hey. How's it going? - Pretty good. How are you? - I'm alright. Could see you are eating lunch by yourself. Yeah. Would you like to go to dinner with me? First lunch, then dinner.

They just transported the vic. She was still on the floor when I got here. I put the robe on her. Name's Mary Delany. I've seen her before. She works over in Century City. Yeah? How well do you know her? I just saw her in passing at a law office, that's all. Mary? I'm Detective Tom Reese. Are you all right? I remember you. No, I'm not really all right. Mary, tell me what happened. It happens in the gaps. Tell me. Tell me everything that you can remember. You knew the deceased? The deceased, Rand Foley. I'm sorry. I thought you said did I know the diseased. - Well, did you? - Yeah. Did you kill Rand Foley? How many times have we been together? It ain't a numbers game. Mary. Mary, it's Detective Reese. - Tom. - Yes. You're implicated in Rand Foley's murder. I know. I mean, I can guess. The coroner says that Rand Foley died of a heart attack. But there was significant pre-mortem bruising that does not easily correlate with you, with your body strength. Was there someone else there with you? He brought me. A man brought you to Rand Foley's house? He's taken a certain interest in me and I've found it very difficult to dissuade him. Who? He can hear. Who can hear? He can hear everything. Who? I want to help you, but I need to know what you know to do that. Hayward. Did Hayward know Rand Foley? He knows everything about me. Did Hayward kill Rand Foley? It feels real and then it doesn't. It's like sex. You know how sex can feel like a dream after it happens? Go on. It's sexual and I feel embarrassed. What else can you tell me about last night? I'm trapped. I pretend that I don't want to be, but I am. - I wish you'd reconsider and come back home with us. - I'm okay. - You're in denial. - No, I'm not. You look really tired. The detective told me he could give me a ride home if you want... No, no, I'm not letting some detective drive you home. Why? He's really nice. You're really lucky. I'm lucky? That he believes you. What if they charged you? What if we'd had to post bail? Ouch. Mary, you're under suspicion. I know. I need to find you an attorney. Do you hear bagpipes? No. Okay, um... Thank you again. And I will call you later. Okay. Thank you for giving me a ride. I'll call you later. Okay, yeah. I'll talk to you later. - Bye guys. - Bye. I think she's looking at me. She is coming to the window. Mary? - Tom. - Miss Delany. - You can come inside. - Thank you. I've placed you under surveillance. You're being watched for your protection. - All night? - Yes. Okay. So you don't have to stay outside. Not me. Sergeant Vanderhorn is stationed outside. I'm heading up the investigation so I've got things to do. Don't worry. I'll stop by in the morning. Thank you. - Good night. - Good night. Please don't go. - Mary... - Hey. Could I make you some coffee or some tea or something? - Uh, okay. - Okay. Great. I'll get it started. - I'll be right up. - Great. - I'm gonna back and talk to her. - Yeah? Stay awake. Can she make me a cup of coffee? I'm serious. Hey. Come on in. You can take a seat if you want. Um, is herbal okay? That's fine. He takes me. And I let him. Who takes you? Hayward? Are you in a relationship with Hayward? What do you mean? You mean, is he my boyfriend? I mean, just what kind of a relationship do you have with this man? He touched me. He touched you sexually? He rearranged my molecules. I know it sounds crazy. It is crazy. Am I guilty? Are you? - Of what? - You tell me. If he made me then I'm not. Were you coerced? Yes. Coerced to do what? To fuck. - It's hopeless. - No, it's not. Can you please stay? Sergeant Vanderhorn is very capable. He'll be just outside all night. I know. It's just I feel safer with you. I can stick around for a bit. Thank you. - Hey. - Hi. - Do you mind? - No. Couldn't stay up there alone. You don't have to stay up there. You can do whatever you like. Get on with your life. I don't have a life. I'm sorry. That sounded really whiny. No, it doesn't. Is there something you want to tell me? I don't know where to begin. Begin anywhere. Begin in the middle. I feel guilty. Of what? Did you see that? See what? It seemed really close. What is it, Mary? Thank you for trying. I'll make us an omelette. You love my omelettes. Shall we call him up for a snack? - Who? - Mr. Nice Guy. I liked it last night. It's horrible that I liked it. Sweetheart. Fuck. You care. Tom. Tom. Vanderhorn. Report. Goddammit, Vanderhorn, report! Mary? Mary! Vanderhorn! Dispatch. I've got an officer down. I need paramedics and backup, right away. Mary? Are you injured? Mary, put down the knife. Are you Hayward? - Mary, is he Hayward? - Yes. He's playing games. She's the killer. Drop the knife! That's not true. He's lying. He made me do it. Put your hands over your head. She likes to do it. Halt. Halt! Mary, put down the knife. No! No! He touched you. He touched me. Bad things happen when he touches you. I can't hear the voices anymore. They're gone. What do you think happens when you fly up to the hole in the sky? Can you hear him? No. Tom! What the hell's wrong with him? Tom. Tom. Infected. He's up there.
