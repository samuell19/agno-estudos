TO ALLOW THEM TO LIVE FREELY THE ALOITADORES IMMOBILISE THE BESTAS WITH THEIR BODIES TO CROP AND TAG THEM THE BEASTS What would you do? Stop working with him, at least. "At least", right... He'd send him to the guillotine. A lot of people lost their heads for a lot less, Poli. You love to exaggerate. Poli, when did the last Frenchman get the guillotine? How should I know? Later than the last ones garrotted here: in 1977. Fucking country of savages. And then they complain about us. I exaggerate? The fuck I do, Perry. I haven't heard anyone else complain about the youngest of the Rubios. Nobody does. And you don't want to know... Have you heard something? Are you deaf, Poli? Tell him, damn it! Tell him, for fuck's sake. My brother-in-law had issues with him too. Issues... Your brother-in-law, Poli, paid a fortune for a fertiliser. And it was dripping when it arrived. Dripping! The guy who sold it is clueless, a moron... or a son of a bitch. Quite simply. Does that silence mean you agree, or what? Young Rubio is just starting out. He's bound to mess things up. Do you always get it right first time? You never get it wrong? I seldom get it wrong. Gentlemen, behold Xan Anta, who always gets it right first time. Mr Perfection. That's it. Now you see the five? - Spot on! - Calculated, damn it! Spot on! - Count it properly. - Twenty-three. Paulino, listen. If they deliver your pig food late, damaged, what do you do? They're pig food. Eusebio. If they bring it late, damaged, grudgingly, in fits and starts, and moaning about it... Moaning! What do you do, Eusebio? Call another supplier. I get the message. I see, now you get it. Right now? Now it's clear. In the olden days... Amadeo the First of Savoy! Listen to me... In the 90s, if they brought your blow late, damaged and grudgingly, what did you do? Nothing, my friend, because you had proper dealers who brought you cocaine that didn't leak, damn it. That didn't leak! And today, Amadeo, what if they bring your seeds late, damaged and grudgingly? They can fuck right off. Damn it, Perri... I get the feeling we're all on the same page. You're heartless, Xan. He's Eloi's boy. He's practically family. If I have to help his son, I'll do so as if he were my own. Wait, wait. Careful. Old Eloi... has been to my house a million times. He's a good man, he's polite, a good person... Right, Loren? And he helped us a lot. That man really looked out for my brother Loren and me. And Mum. We're all there is here. This place is like a ghost town. If that moron goes around Spain conning everyone there, they'll end up associating his name with yours. And before you know it everyone in the region will be fucked, caught up in the same shit. You do what the fuck you want, like you always do! Damn it! Old Eloi would agree with me. And the others, too. They all agreed. Only to shut you up. What's that? You convinced Miguel to stay and play and now you won't shut up. You have the nerve to tell me...? Are we boring you, Frenchy? What? Are we boring you? Not going to say bye? In Spain, we say hello when we arrive. In Spain, we say bye when we leave. It's not that hard. See you tomorrow. There you go... Loren, tell him about... Afternoon. Come on. Everything okay? Fine. - Did you go to Portela? - Yes. And? - The roof will hold up. - But didn't it rain? Yes, but it'll hold up. You look tired. I am tired. And I'm hungry. Have you eaten? I think good eaters are sexy. I agree. But you're ahead of me, I can't keep up with you. Even so, she likes me. No, she adores you. Because you won her over. - Really? - Yes. Like at the market. What? You normally attract... How can I say...? Women with experience. Because they know what's good. Everything's good, lady. Of course it is. Thanks. Bye! Two kilos? And two lettuces. And the tomatoes? Month and a half, right? Yes, that's right. Keep two or three crates for me, then. Of course. My sister-in-law says French tomatoes are the best. Thank her for us. What's your name? Cheli. Cheli. What a beautiful name. 5.50, please. Cheli, you can count on us. I'm going to bed. - Have you eaten? - No. I'll be right up. Haven't seen him for a while. Hi, Pepiño! Good morning! Pepiño, how are you? Great. You? - Good, good. - Great. This is for you. Thanks, Pepiño. - And a present. - Chorizo, right? Fancy a coffee? No, thanks. Don't worry, Olga. - I'm making some. - No, don't worry. Thanks. - Want some? - Yes, love. Thanks, Pepiño. Please don't go on about it again. I'm not. I don't even know what you're doing. This land needs a rest. Three times the tomatoes fit here. It's the science of the land. The essence? The science! If you read more, you'd know. If you practised more, your Spanish would be better. What a waste of a vegetable garden. Titán. Come on. Titán, come on. Come here. What's wrong? I don't know. It just stopped. Get in. I'll take you. Come on! Get moving! - Are you done? - Come on, mate! It was a joke. Come on, get in! Come on, mate! Don't you joke in France? Once is a joke. Twice is an insult. All right, mate. Sorry. - Come on, get in! - No. It was just a joke, mate. I'll take you to Fran's and they'll fix it before lunch! Come on! I'm in a rush! In a rush... When are you ever in a rush? Okay? Idiot! See you later, dimwit! What are you doing? Come here. Come here. Don't be mad, Frenchy! What? Do you think that's funny? You're a fucking idiot. Can I pay up, Eusebio? I'm off. See you tomorrow! Go home and keep your wife happy! After yesterday... Better behave yourself today. No football for you tonight! He won't perform tonight. He's wasted. Drunk as a skunk. Hope he doesn't crash his car. They took his car away a while ago. He crashed into that tree stump. Frenchy... What now? Don't turn your back to us, Frenchy. Want to play with us? Dominoes. We're a player short. Damn, are you scared? Don't be scared! Come and join in with the village. Come here. Get involved, Frenchy. That's right. That's how I like it. Here, next to me. You've seen us play, right? Put his name down. Put him down as... Toñito the Conqueror. Conquering everything in his path. Did you know the French came to conquer us in the past? But they went back the way they came. They came for us thinking we were fucking idiots. Napoleon said it himself: "They're idiots de merde". Idiots de merde! Do you still think that, Frenchy? Double six. Do you still think we're idiots de merde? I can't speak for all French people. Isn't it on the agenda of your French annual conclave every 14th of July? I'd never seen your teeth. What lovely teeth, they're like dominoes. We thought you didn't have any. Let's have a bet, Frenchy. Between you and me. Let's have a bet, you and me. If you win this game, I'll finish all the houses that you're fixing up. I'll do it properly, like on the telly. What's that programme called, Loren? Which one? - That house programme. - Restoration Home. Restoration Home, know it? It's crazy. Three Vikings buy some dump that's falling apart and in the blink of an eye, it's a Byzantine Palace. That's what you want to do here, conquer the village and make it into a fucking Club Med for foreign tourists. That's not true. It's for people from here. Your turn. Let me tell you... In your imaginary urban development projects here, haven't you realised that we don't fit in with your plan? Can't you see that, when all of those people come to live here, attracted by your organic lettuces, the pure air and mother nature herself who birthed us all, when they see our ugly faces, Loren and me, they'll hotfoot it back to their countries? You should have signed. For the wind turbines, given that you're... a real tree hugger, and set up your Club Med elsewhere, with less ugly people, instead of talking people's ears off with that mouth of yours... that teacher's mouth that God gave you. And which pisses us off, Frenchy. And then, we'd get by with the money from the wind turbines. - Xan. - Yes, Breixo, what is it? I didn't sign because I didn't want to. Have some respect. The respect is different... You may think it's the same, but it's not, Breixo. And why? For many reasons, Breixo, but two main ones. You were born here and will probably die here. - You can't say that. - First. And second, if I can finish... With you, Breixo... unlike with others, we can talk, rationalise. Damn it, Loren, I've got a problem, I don't get French humour. I think he just said something funny and... Did you make a joke? Actually, I didn't. Why didn't you sign? You never told us, why didn't you sign? We've discussed it, Xan. You went on a thousand times with that nonsense that it's invasive, not eco-friendly, and God knows what else. Tell me from the heart. Tell me honestly why you didn't sign. I couldn't. "I couldn't", he said. You could, with your hand. The one you jerk off with. But maybe you just didn't feel like signing. Tell me why you didn't sign. Because this is my home. Xan. That's enough. Let's have another game. Let it go. This is Manolo. Hi, nice to meet you. My wife, Olga. Nice to meet you. - His cousin was born in this house. - Really? He doesn't get this. Some guard dog you are. - Get in, come on. - I'm coming! If not, I'll throw you in. Stop being annoying, I'm coming. - It's not that cold. - I'm coming, Javi. - It's not cold, try it. - No, no! - No, Javi, please! - Come on! Come on, you're wet now. Fuck, you bastard. It's freezing! It's fine once you swim a bit. Hey, come here. What do you want, Frenchy? To talk to you. What about? Come here! Coming, Frenchy! No, I don't drink when I'm working. Never when I'm working. - Come here. - We're working. Come here! Get on with your work. Xan, come here! Give me five minutes. Have some fucking patience. That's not very eco-friendly, is it? We'll have to get another two. They haven't spoken to us for six months. The other day, in Eusebio's bar, he invited me to play dominoes. He called me "Frenchy" in front of everyone. He brought up the wind turbines, why I didn't sign... And the next day, in front of my house, there were two bottles of that liqueur... Orujo. Two bottles. And the next day, two other bottles. And my wife's chair and my own, covered in urine. - Urine? - Yes. Right. We'll talk to the two brothers and if it's them... It's them. You don't know that, Antoine. Please, it was them. I mean, you're neighbours. You have a beer, you have words. These things happen between neighbours. But I'd like to ask you not to get back to your old tricks. Old tricks? It isn't just something between neighbours. No, it's not. Sign each page, please. You know what he means. You guys have quite a history... Don't worry, we'll talk to them. We will. Please do. No, she ignores it. She pretends it's nothing. She won't give me my money and then she uses it to buy me drinks. Marie, if she's really your friend, sit down and talk to her, she'll understand. If she's truly your friend. Yes, I know, but... But she's so stubborn, thinks it's normal, it's complicated. Maybe I haven't been clear, but... If not, tell her your dad will have words with her. Yes, I'm sure if I say that she'll get the message. Great idea. And how's Mum? Fine. She sends her love. - I hope we can come this summer. - Yes. - Hi, sweetie! - Hi, Grandpa. - What? - What is he wearing? What is that? A onesie? Yes. Put that cigarette out, Marie. Why is he dressed like a frog? What type of pyjama is that? Antoine. - Look. - What? Do you see them? No, but they're there.. I'm sure of it. Hello! - What'll it be? - Same as always. Coming right up. Not the same as always! He'll just pass out later. You like to sleep, right, Frenchy? A good dinner, a good sleep. Don't start! Eusebio! It's a joke for Frenchy. Calm down, we won't wreck your bar. I'll get them a round of drinks. Your money's no good here. We're the ones who pay. But us neighbours should help each other out. You should watch out, because one day... 25th OF JULY GET CLOSER That Begoña, she downed two whole bottles of coffee liqueur and half a bottle of white stuff, pure alcohol. How long was she awake, saying her heart was bursting out of her? Two days. Eusebio, where are my three drinks? They're coming. Know what, Xan? Your dad was a real beast. My dad was a son of a bitch, Perri. Loren, your refurbishment is only half finished. I painted the door. It needs to dry. You painted it with the tip of your dick. Your brother's our resident Picasso. Yes, Picasso Dick. Picasso Dick. Do you like it? The cat meat. Do you like it? What? It's cat, you know? Xan, he doesn't know it's cat. How would he know? In France, they don't eat cats. Eusebio. Have the balls to tell him. Is it dead cat? Eusebio, fucking hell! It's cat. It's not cat. No... It's kangaroo! Damn it, Frenchy, don't get like that. We've always eaten cat here. I mean... What do you think? That Eusebio would kill a cow? Just to feed us? Eusebio hasn't got the balls to say because he wants you to pay. And to come back. And let me tell you... He's the only one who wants you back. It's like rabbit. We'll pick the cabbages by Wednesday or the caterpillars will eat them. Are you really worried about me filming? It's just in case. It might be useless. I don't know. - Morning, Loren. - Hi, Pepiño. - Morning. - Morning. - Taking a break? - Yes. Getting up here is a struggle for you. Not at all. You're puffing, look after yourself. Leave him alone. You ignore him. Feel more tired than before, Pepiño? You're more of an idiot. I'm worried about you. And yourself? Look at you. - I'll get your lettuces. - Yes, get him out of my sight. - You brought chorizo? - Of course. There's not a soul here, Manolo. I know. It's a quiet morning. It must be... the fucking summer break. I'll have 20... Give me those batteries... Of course. What are you up to, Frenchy? Buying the paper. Am I bothering you? Does buying the paper involve looking at me? What are you looking at? Nothing. You're the one looking at me. How are you, Antoine? Good. Everything okay? And you? Yes, nothing new. - The newspaper? - Yes, please. Anything else? My money's in the car. Be right back. Okay, no problem. I'll have 20... Give me those batteries... Of course. And the paper? What? Where's the paper, Frenchy? What's that in your pocket? Scratching your balls? Or filming me? You're paranoid. You were filming me. We've seen you with a camera. You were filming me, weren't you? You were... Fuck's sake! Son of a bitch! Fucking bastard! Antoine? Antoine, look at this! What is it? Look. They put two batteries in the well, the bastards. It's lead. That black stuff was lead. It's the 16th of August. It's 11 a.m. My wife Olga has seen... What...? ...that the tomatoes we planted three months ago were already ripe. Stop that. Stop recording. They're all fucked. Where are you going? Stop recording! Hi, Loren. - You okay? - Hi. What are you doing? Nothing. Nothing? And your brother? Inside. Why? No reason. Loren. One thing. Have you tried our tomatoes? Why? Our tomatoes. Have you tried them? Let go of me! Did you throw car batteries in our well? Yes or no? Yes or no? Answer me. Answer me, Loren. I'll send you to prison. Loren. Have you got that into your fucking head, Loren? Go to hell! Come here! Come here, Loren! Come closer. Going to use that gun? I might. Come on. Don't shoot. Get out of here! Stop filming. My harvest is wrecked, Xan. What the fuck do I care? Get out of here! Do you know what you've done? You've ruined us! Get lost, for fuck's sake! What are you doing? You bastard. You've ruined us! Get off my land! Get off my land right away! You moron! Get out of here! Get lost, damn it! Why did you let that guy in? Son of a bitch! We'll talk to them. This is serious. Do you see what they've done? Don't worry. We'll make it clear. They mustn't come here again. We'll tell them. But the same applies to your husband. You went onto their property. It's different. Without permission, filming them, insulting them and really quite angry. It's on camera. They contaminated our wells! Calm down, we're going to investigate it. Antoine, listen to me! Listen, come here. We're going to investigate. But don't give in to provocation. They threatened him with a gun. You saw that. It wasn't loaded. - You can't be sure of that. - I assure you. Before going to see the Antas, he should have come to us. Ah, I see. We have to abide by the rules, but they can do whatever they want? Be armed, contaminate the water... You heard what I said. I find it hard to understand. Your husband can't use intellectual superiority over the brother. What do you mean? Take it easy! Lorenzo is slow because of the horse accident. And you're a teacher. Well-educated, read, travelled... You took advantage. Tell them we don't want to see them around here. If not, I'll talk to your superior. Is that clear? Yes. We'll tell them now. Don't worry. Let's go! We can keep the card to analyse... - For the investigation? - Yes. Breixo. How many people lived here before? Lots. Children, even. When our houses are renovated, people will come back. If you say so. Life is good here. My daughter likes coming with my grandson. My nephew never comes. Poor thing wanted those windmills. Money's all people think about now. That's right. But there's money here. If we work hard. The land is demanding. It can devour you. You'll see. How long does a goat take to produce good cheese? If you want good cheese, you need sheep. Sheep are bigger and produce more milk. - We'll recover. - Of course we will. But, at what price? Working like mules, wasting our savings. Until when? And then, what? They won't stop. They're uncontrollable. We'll defend ourselves. We didn't come here to fight. We can't leave. They have nothing else. Nothing to lose. That's why we need the cameras. You know what I think. I don't know what else to do. I know it scares you, but it's the only solution. To get justice... Stop saying it's the only solution. There's always another solution. Shall we go to sleep? You know I'm nothing without you. You know that? I thought we could buy some sheep. I'm Rafael, Breixo's nephew. I'm so sorry. Better to die in the mountain than in a hospital. I was telling your wife my fond memories of my summers here. - Do you want a coffee? - No, thanks. You probably already know this but my uncle was a widower and had no children. I inherited his land. Do you mind if I sit down? I haven't been here for ages. I have my dry cleaners, my life. This money won't set me up for life, I've already done that myself. Do you follow? No, not really. It's quite clear. I inherited my uncle's vote, making it six against three. Six for the wind turbines, three, against. I've told my lawyers not to contact anyone yet. I know about your arguments and problems with some people. I know who. My uncle told me, he was very worried. Great coffee. We can see eye to eye. These hill-folk have good things and bad things, as you've seen. We must act quickly or the developers will go elsewhere. But for the people here, what a missed opportunity! They'll go elsewhere? Yes, they told my lawyers. - Where? - Anywhere where there's wind. Can we see it? I have nothing on me, I'll send the papers. We'd like that. No problem. Between us, I know the other opposing voters. You convinced them against it, but they live elsewhere. One comes to work his land and the other only comes in summer. We'll talk to them, explain it. It's now or never. I may be wrong. But if I'm not, it would be eight for, one against. Eight, Antoine. I know you don't care about money, but there are farmers suffering here. You have to understand. - We do care about money. - No. You give away the houses that you do up. Because they're not ours. You spend time on them, buy material, tools. It's not cheap. It is to us. You value other things more, like me. But not here, they haven't travelled, studied... nothing. We did those things. My dry cleaners are going well. I have a house. Like you. It's obvious. It's a lovely project, but... who would want to live here? If they were rural hotels... But houses? The people here want to leave and those who stay... die. We came here. - Think about it. All that money... - It's not that much. They pay less than the land's worth. It's money. You could use it to do your project somewhere else. Galicia's huge. It'll set these people up for life. - Set them up for life? - Think about it. We will. You got off on the wrong foot. Hill-people are simple. Which is good and bad. You already said that. Is it a threat? No, I'm not threatening anybody. I just think you have to be careful. Unbelievable. Listen... I'm thinking about my children. What do I want to leave for them? An easy or difficult life? - You have a daughter, right? - Yes. All of these... plots of land are problems. For everyone. So you'll think about it? We said we would. Thank you for your time and for the coffee. I'll get back to the dry cleaners, I must have a hundred missed calls. A pleasure to meet you. You'll think about it, Antoine? Do you think they sent him? How should I know? What is it? What should we do? Turn around. And go where? Lock your door. Let us through. - Let us through, Loren. - Roll the window down. It's our bedtime. Roll the window down. Please. Roll the window down. If I don't, they won't go. Roll the window down. - Let us through. - More. - Let us through. - Roll it down more. - More. - Loren. - It's late. - Don't do it. Let us through, please. I'm with my wife. Let us through, please. You're not that strong. - Want some coffee? - No, thanks. If I hadn't been there, they would've killed you. - Of course not. - Yes. - No. - They would have. What were they doing there waiting for us with a rifle? What did they expect? They were just drunk. And? That's the way they are. I'm scared now. And so were you last night. Do we just go on living this way? I don't want to. You think they want to kill us? Not me. But you? Yes. That takes bravery, and they don't have that. Is it worth it? - What? - This. Of course it's worth it. Trust me. - Fuck, Loren, let the dog go. - Sit. - Come on, Draco, here. - Good boy. Come on, Draco. Damn it, Loren. He prefers me. If you were less ugly... Bloody hell. Can I get you a drink? Let me buy you a drink. You can't say no. A bottle, please, Eusebio. Sit down here, Loren. It's fine. What? When I arrived we used to drink together. And you asked me what the hell I was doing here. I didn't speak your language well enough to explain myself. I didn't understand a word you said. I've travelled around a lot. Messing around. One night, I was so drunk I had to stop. I lay down and saw the starry sky. When I woke up I was here, in this valley. I thought about it my whole life. I said: "When I'm older, I'll go there. And I'll be free". And you'd be free right here? It's a story... A beautiful story. Do you think I'm here on a whim? No, Xan. It's everything to me. It's my life project. With my wife. That's not what I think. - What do you think? - You won't like it. Say it. I don't think it's fair that your vote is the same as mine, because you're not from here, you're French. Honestly? It's not fair, not because... Not because you're foreign... Let's not get into that. It's not fair... because you've been here playing at farming for two years. I've been here 52 years. And him, 45. My mum, 73. And we're fed up of being miserable. But the worst thing... we didn't know we were miserable until the wind turbine developers came and showed us the figures. And every time I get up at five in the morning, with a hellish hangover and my back in agony, I think of you. And then it's just another beautiful day. What would you do with the money? Do you know? Of course. What would you do? Do you really care? I'm interested, yes. Tell me. A taxi. In Ourense. - A taxi? - A taxi. Half a day, me, half a day, my brother. - And your mum? - At home. Not working, she's done enough. At your house? Yes, my house. Do you think the wind turbine money is enough for all that? Do you know? No, I'm asking you. Have you looked into it? I'll get by, just like I always have. That's true. But you're 50 years old. You have no studies. - Calling me an idiot? - No. In fact, I think... I had a right to that money. I had a right to it, damn it! And you came between my right and me. You know Loren was a handsome little boy? So handsome, just looking at him sent you into a daze. Into a real daze. You didn't know? I took him to the whores and... they turned him away. Know why? The whores said that he scared them, that he was a brute. But that wasn't it. We smell of shit here. We smell of shit. All I want is a woman like yours. One for me, one for my brother. Impossible, there aren't any. And a child? Can I have one? It's impossible here. Remember what you said there? Playing dominoes. "This is my home". - "This is my home". - Yes. That's stuck with me because you said it as if you're the only one it meant something to. You're not. It's our home too. And way before you arrived. Careful! If you really... If you really all want us to leave... my wife and I, we'll go. - It's only fair. - I think so. It's only fair. But there's a problem. You contaminated our harvest. My wife and I, we lost everything. A whole year's work. Look me in the eyes and tell me it wasn't you. I dare you. Is that your revenge? - Is that your revenge? - No. I'm trying to explain that, even if I wanted, I couldn't leave. Because the wind turbine money isn't enough to start from scratch. I'm trying to tell you, but you won't listen, Xan. You only hear what you want to hear. Listen, for one moment there I thought you'd sign and get the hell out of here. It was a beautiful moment. When my wife and I have a new harvest and get back what we lost, I'd be willing to vote again. And if it's eight against one, we'll leave. By then, the developer will have gone elsewhere, Frenchy! I wouldn't trust your friend Rafael. The next village will get rich because we're too dumb to sign. You don't understand! It's always the same people who make a killing. Know who they are? - Don't shout. - No? The Norwegians who don't want windmills on their land so they come here and do it for next to nothing. Don't shout at me. Don't shout at me. Does it bother you? A little. You've forced me, not asked me, forced me out of my home. You came onto my property, you contaminated my harvest. You insulted me, spat in my face, and you sent a man to my house to threaten me. And me shouting at you bothers you? You're a genius. You're a genius. Thought you were sick of my face. I've had enough. - You've had enough? - Yes. And even so, I'm willing to talk to you. But you won't listen. I'll never talk to you again. I can't leave, because I can't leave. You want me to go. What can we do? - That's the big question. - What can we do? We'll both do what we have to do. What will you do? What will you do? I wish you'd woken up in another village. You can't change that. What will you do? Answer me. What will you do? Loren, we're done here. Come on. Getting there? Yes. We could do some weeding. I'll help, hang on. Two minutes. What? What? Nothing. What is it? Those meatballs. - A little dog? - Yes... - A chorizo? - Of course not! - Happy birthday, love! - Thanks. Presents! You didn't know? Happy birthday, Pepiño! - What is it? - Surprise! You won't like it. - A vest! - Do you like it? - Isn't it the same as yours? - Of course not. What is it? What's going on? You don't like the colour? - I love the colour. - What's wrong? Nothing. Two months of work. - Thanks. - Two months? Let's see... It's a joke. Did you make it? It's not a joke, I swear. It's ridiculous, I'm sorry. Where did you buy this? At the market, love. I'm sorry, it's horrible. Two's better than one. I'll fix this. I'll fix it right away. You made it yourself? I have an idea to fix this. Get a move on, Pepiño! This one for me, this one for my friend, Antoine. Not your wife's one. Olga, I'd love him to have it. - You're sure? - Of course. - It'll suit him. - Recording. It's wonderful. - Like a boy band. - Great. Pepiño, a speech. Yes, a speech, Pepiño! To celebrate the sweater. It's cause for celebration. That's settled, then. Thank you. Thank you, my Aurora. For putting up with me. And thank you for coming over and being such good neighbours. I hope we're neighbours for a long time yet. - Cheers to that! - Cheers! The same design. How funny. Thanks, Pepiño, for your words. Thank you. And a big thank you to you, Aurora. Because we knew when we came here that we would miss our friends. And we really do miss them. Especially you. Really? Maybe, I'm not sure. But we're lucky to have you. Thank you. And are you happy here? You don't miss your past life? Yes, I'm really happy here. Cheers to that. - To here. - To here. You want him back? Come on. Go on. Where's my dog? Where's my dog? Don't worry about it. Where's my dog? So, Loren? Is this how brave you are? Is this how brave? Let's go. Titan! From here to here, and there to there. Next week, I'll do this area. Got that down? I want to go up here. But it's too cold at the moment. Be careful, it's dangerous over there. Yes, I know. Xosé, come here for a moment. Excuse me. Do you have everything? It's all here. Okay, I'll be off. Everything else okay? Yes. - Business going well? - Yes, yes. Will you be at the Barbeira fair next week? It's a great fair. - Thanks, good evening. - Good evening. Mrs Denis. Feel free to come whenever you want and give us information on your searches. It could help us to find information. But? You know that this area was inspected a year ago. - That's what they told me. - And it's true. Okay. Evening. Delicious. Thanks. How much for the leeks, please? 1.60. And 2.70 for you. Thanks, love. Morning! Can we walk through here? Yes, of course. And to get to the river? Yes, it's that way. Okay, thanks. You're welcome. It's all there is. I'm not thrilled about it. Nine? Do something, then. What can I do? Look around you. There's nothing here. It was fifteen, not nine. It's all I've got now. If you want them, they're yours. How long for the other six? Two or three weeks. Give me a call. - Two or three weeks. - Yes, I understood. Do you want them? I don't know. I think you should. You have to pay for them all now. I want to fill in my almanac. Fucking hell! What a swindler. What did your friend say? I don't know, mate. I don't get half of what she says. Count it. - You okay? - Yes. - And you? - Yes. How was your trip? Fine, but I'm exhausted. Why didn't you bring him? He's too young to skip class. Mum. You need to leave here. And you know it. I'll stay with you as long as you need and help you sell everything. Eva will look after Pierrot, and we'll leave together. You can stay with us until you find something. I don't want to go. You can live with us, I'd like that. I don't want to go, Marie. - Why? - You know why. Tell me again. Well? I like it here. With Dad's murderers? What's your plan? - Be here by yourself forever? - I'm not by myself. No, of course not. There's an old dog and ten sheep. - Nine. - Mum... I'm not alone, Marie. I know people. I'm happy here, it's going well. Okay, you're happy and you don't feel alone. But don't you think what happened is unfair? What do you think? Well, then? I've been trying to understand but I can't. And every time I come, it's less clear. And I tell people, and nobody understands. Why do you think that is? Maybe you have to be here to understand it. They killed my dad, I can have an opinion, can't I? Yes. But you have to accept my decision. Okay, what will you do? Be a shepherd in the morning and look for Dad's body after lunch? - Yes, that's it. - No, damn it! That's all I'll do. I'm scared, Mum. I think about you non-stop, worried something will happen. Understand? Those people, they live next door. Do you look them in the eye? How can you? - I try not to think about it... - Then think about it! They killed Dad. And they're calm as can be, with their country lives. You want to stay in this hell where anything goes. It's not what matters most. I can't let you. You're coming, like it or not. That's it. You need help. I told you the first time I came, and the second, but you ignore me. Get used to it, you're coming with me. No. They could come after you. No. They're more afraid than I am. Afraid of what? Of you? - That you'll go after them? - Of the truth coming out. You don't even know what the truth is! Nobody cares about the truth. And if they're afraid of that, they'll come after you. You see? No. They won't hurt me. That's what Dad said, and look. I've spoken to a psychologist. He says you want to stay because you can't accept the truth. You witnessed a tragedy and you're still living in it. You refuse to move forward. But you have to. Why wait? - To rot here? - Excuse me? - You heard. - Careful what you say, Marie. It's what will happen. You'll end up alone. You're already alone, damn it. Those people don't like you. They don't like people like us. They've always laughed at us. - Why do you say that? - You know why! The police ignored us, they laughed at you and Dad, your vegetable patch and your arrogance. You were the hillbillies. I've never told you how to live your life. We didn't raise you this way. No. I only want my son to know his grandmother. Now he won't know his grandfather. Nothing will happen to me, I swear. Don't you want to live with us? Is our life so bad compared to this paradise? I'd love to see you more, but when your father and I came here, we knew we'd see you less. How about we stop arguing and just live together? I need you. And you need me. Marie. We have our own lives. When you left home, I had a hard time, but I accepted it: that's life. At first, it was hard being away from you, from Pierrot and our friends, but I don't want to change my life now. It's our home. There's no "our" any more. Can't you see? They killed your husband and left him in a ditch. See that? Don't you get that? If you don't come with me, I'll never come here again. You'll never see us again. Is that what you want? Do you mean that? My son can't be around a lunatic. - Out of my kitchen! - No! - I don't want to talk. - We will until you see sense. I'll take you by force. But... How dare you speak to me or anyone else like that? How dare you tell me what to do? Don't you understand? More than you know. What have you done with your life? Jumping between flowers, from one useless fling to another, from one idiot to another, with shitty jobs, a lack of ambition, always with excuses, because you wanted "experiences"... And what did we do? Supported you, gave you everything. I didn't ask you to. Because we didn't raise you that way. Don't you forget that. It has nothing to do with you. - Sure about that? - Yes. Look back. - Think about your decisions. - I have no regrets. Like having a son with that guy, think about that. - Lunatic Mum supported you. - Leave my son alone. Did I tell you what to do? - Did I insult you in your kitchen? - Stop. Stop. Listen to me! Did I insult you in your kitchen and tell you how to live? Did I? You have no idea about men, Dad's all you've known. You have no idea about life or being a single mum. I don't, because I decided to raise my daughter with my partner. And you didn't decide to butt out of my life, it was Dad. Because he decided everything, he ran your life. Your dad wanted to smash your son's dad's face, I stopped him. Of course. That's right... Dad decided everything: where you lived, how you lived, and when you did things. - You know nothing. - You were submissive. A pathetic, small woman. - Stop, Marie. - He always ran your life. He did when he was alive and still does now he's dead. You don't understand. I don't understand? Know what people are saying? What your friends are saying? That maybe he left you. How can you say that? Not me, your friends. I hope that one day you find love and stop being so bitter. Go to hell. Hey, sleepy head. Hi, Pepiño. How are you, sleeping beauty? Good. You? I'm fine. Come to help a bit? Yes. What can I do? Morning. Go to the sheep pen, get rid of the snow and change the straw. Are you staying long? I don't know. Fuck. Hold it down for five seconds. Come here, Titán! - Titán, come here. - Good boy. Titán, here. Come here, Titán. Titán! Come on. Stop messing about. Come here, Titán. Stop messing about, come on. Come on. Here! Let's go. Come on, Titán! You're going? Yes. It's going to rain. We'll see. I'll come with you. Coming? There are hunters in that area. Yes, I've heard them. Thanks. You need to stop this in two weeks. There are some nasty storms coming. Why aren't they helping you? It would be quicker, right? You don't have to stay. I'm staying. Everything okay? No, not at all. - Why not search with her? - Marie... Afraid of finding something awkward? I don't understand. Sorry, she's angry. You're apologising? You're to blame, like the other two. You. Responsible. Understand? Come on, I can't allow this. I need them on my side. - Okay, translate for me. - No. - Translate, damn it! - Translate, fuck! Calm down, please. Let's calm down. Sit down and translate. Ask them how they could just cross their arms when a citizen received death threats that were filmed. Ask them. You're wrong. There are no threats recorded. I've seen the videos. There are no death threats in the videos. So I'm making it up? No, but you're wrong. The threats weren't recorded. The stuff that's recorded is utterly useless. I've told you. I don't care. You should be ashamed. Not the same as always! He'll just pass out later. You like to sleep, right? A good dinner, a good sleep. Don't start! Eusebio! It's a joke for Frenchy. Calm down, we won't wreck your bar. I'll get them a round of drinks. Your money's no good here. We're the ones who pay. But us neighbours should help each other out. You should watch out, because one day... It's 6:00 a.m. on the 25th of October. My neighbour's waiting for me, drunk. I can't leave my house. Let's see what happens. Hey, neighbour. Miss me? My wife works the land with a natural don. She conquers all, she is intrepid and brave, she observes her kingdom like a queen. Come on, Marie, get up or we'll be late. We need to find him. There he is. Hello. Why are you here? It's not what we agreed. Yes, Tuesday the 20th. No. Today? - Are these mine? - No. I don't have yours. - What? - I didn't expect you today. I think you're mistaken. The sheep I get next week will be better for you. What? - Is it for cheese? - Yes. The ones I get next week are better for cheese. So the ones you're selling are no good? Yes, they're good. But it's a good opportunity. Not interested. - What is it? - He's trying to cheat me, as always. These are my sheep. I've already paid, and I'm taking them, okay? You're too late. If you'd come earlier... But it's hard to cancel a payment now... That's your problem. Come another day. - No. - Next week. I'm not leaving without my animals! Stop taking me for an idiot! Fine, as you wish. Hey! Cancel the payment and do the invoice again! These ones? Exactly. Not these ones. I bought them! She bought the others. Can I take the animals, please? - No. - Yes. Of course I can. Marie. Help me, please? Come give us a hand, lad. Legs facing outwards so they can't kick you. Come here. - Where do you want them? - Outside. Hey. Is she heavy? Hold her tight. But don't smother her. What? Don't talk to her. Or look at her. I'm just helping. I said stop. It's okay, Marie. It's over. Trust me? Wait for me in the car. Hi. Mum. Yes? I've been thinking about you and Dad. And... the love you had was enviable. Thanks. Here. He'll like them, you'll see. I'll let you know. We'll be in touch. Take care. Didn't it work? No. It's useless. Impossible to recover the information. Will you start looking again? The team's getting a unit together. We'll start tomorrow. Don't worry about that. If the camera was there, Antoine was there too. Most probably, yes. Olga. The camera's a big find. It really is. What brings you here? I want to talk to her. About what? None of your business. I want to talk to her. You talk to me first. About what? You're going to prison. To prison? What's she on about? That's right. You're going to prison. And why, exactly? Did you do something? What do you think? May I? No, let go. I only want to talk. Your sons will go to prison. And you... you'll be all alone, just like me. My sons have done nothing wrong. Your sons... killed my husband. That's not true. They killed Antoine. It's just us now. What should we do? I'm just over there, if you need anything. We just found the body. - Shall I come now? - Yes, of course.
