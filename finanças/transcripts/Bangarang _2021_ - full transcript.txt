Your jokes are not healthy when we're eating rice. Look at your father now. The rice might get stuck in his throat. Mum, I just asked why I have never seen a pregnant Mkorino. Otile, immediately after elections… I'll send you home to stay with your grandmother for a while. I promise. I was worried until I heard the word promise. - Really? - Even you know that… you never keep your promises. Or what do you think Mum? No, keep me out of your issues. Ah! And just like that, Mum has denied me the Peter and Jesus style. It's alright. Your mom knows which side of the bread is buttered. Hmm-mm. It's not like that. You know you two are more relatives than I am? You share the same area chief, same village. Look at you, you've involved a lot of English in this simple story. Mmm? Otile? Which promise have I never fulfilled? You promised to take me to Dubai before the year ends. Hmm. And when is your birthday? In two days. How do you think I was planning to celebrate your birthday? You're the best. This house has now become like the animal farm. The last time I checked, you declared yourself non-relative. Hmm. Wow! No. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. It has been lit! It is burning! It has been lit, it's burning, my brothers, it's burning! It's burning! What is it? They've started again. Who has started what again? The youth. Rioters? Why can't they find something better to do that this stupidity? It's their right to picket. I want to condemn… in unreserved terms… the brutal killing of our people in Kisumu. Now, who are they rioting for? The government that denied them both employment and the leader they elected. But the government is in Nairobi. Why can't we go and riot there? If all men were like you… even the colonialist would still be in Kenya. Bro… give me my change. Give me my change! My change, man! Give me my change! Change, change, change…! They have killed… they have killed! What's wrong with you? You just killed an innocent boy. In the streets no one is innocent. Criminals. Pure criminals. Stop it Chalo. Do you want to give a kidney attack? Mom, it is a heart attack. Why did leave school this late today? You're still playing your gun games that I warned you against? Mom, I told you when I grow up I want to be a policeman. I told you I don't want to hear about that. Mom, why don't you want to understand me? It's you who needs to understand me. If your father wasn't a policeman, I wouldn't have been a widow at this young age. Do you also want to be killed by the criminals like him? But I believe I have a calling to finish my dad's duty. Truck after truck arrives with more officers. Security reinforcements ferried in their numbers to Kisumu town to kill the ongoing riots that have spilt over into the… Baba Joy. Stop living in denial. The politics affect your life whether you like it or not. And now that you're avoiding news, how will you know whether where you're going is already burnt? Mama Joy, you know I hate politics so much. Let me deal with it. It's okay. But bad leadership affects everyone including you who didn't vote. It's fine. Later. - Is Joy asleep? - Yes, she's asleep. - Okay, have a nice day. - You too. Otile, look, the guys you're running with in the streets are not in your class. Those are my true friends. We share a common problem and that… makes them my class. Just take a look at yourself. You're better than this. How? Well… Second class honours degree in automotive engineering. Is that worth rioting on the streets in the company of school dropouts? - I wish you understood. - I understand everything, because… Because none of your tribesmen have been killed by police. How can you understand and… the government is yours? Keep off that tribalism battle. Can you please see me as your long term college lover and not like a Kikuyu. Babe, am not the government. D… When did I graduate from the university? We graduated a very long time ago. Have you ever asked yourself why you got employed immediately, yet I am still jobless to date? - God's timing… - Keep God out of this. Why am I jobless? - It's just… - There is no 'just' here… It's my second name that betrays me. Every time I send an application. Reality check. Nothing will ever change unless we fight… for good leadership. Or what do you think, Njeri? Shh! Please don't call me by that name. Do you want them to kill me? It seems you don't love me. Loving on an empty belly is a challenge. But… You're not the same Otile I knew back on campus who couldn't even kill a fly. What changed you this much? You know very well what changed me. We're not equal. You're privileged. I'm not. You can never challenge the status quo. I wish you knew the kind of atrocities we've gone through in these cities. I wish you knew what they did to us in Naivasha? They raided us. They paraded us. My father's petrol station was set alight. Even my friends… My friends. We grew up as friends happily. That day they didn't know me. They even forgot my name. We were evicted from our home. My whole life I've never imagined I could stay in a shanty like this. For how long have I begged you in vain to come and stay with me? You refused. Are you mad? I can't be domesticated by a woman like a chicken. But I promised. For you… I'll always be there for you. Always. I have to go now. It's risky for me here. I'm in no mood right now. You cannot get an answer from us… right now. Okay. Bye. Take care. Tag! - Otile! - Otile! Queen, how are you? Fine. You can't carry me? I can carry you. - Me, you can't carry me? - I can carry you. I can carry you. You're getting heavy now. Now that you're heavy, let me give you something. - You take this. - Thank you. - And you take this. - Thank you. - And you take this. - Thank you. - What are you going to buy? - Sweets? - And you? - Bhajia. - And you? Very good. - Mr. Corn. - Thank you. - Okay, I'll see you tonight. Otile. You really love children. Very much. Kids are angels. But now, you should marry and have your own. Hey, stop that. Stop that immediately. Marry now, one day you'll realise your expiry date was long overdue. It seems like your witchdoctor told you I have to marry for you to be successful. He lied to you. And now are you off to the riots? I'm off to work, but if they throw, we'll throw back. Dan, how are you? I'm Joy's dad, not Dan. Since when? Six months now… how much to town? Fifty shillings. Not thirty shillings? You know it's not thirty. With these riots it takes a lot to get to town. - Are you set? - Yes, I am good. These people are used to us. But this time round they'll not manage. And who are those? The vote thieves, my friend. This is Kenya. Here… leaders are generated in a boardroom meeting. They'll do all that stupidity but things will still go on. There's no stupidity here. We're fighting for both my right and yours. Stupidity is using stones to fight with the police who have guns. Don't you see it's our people who are dying. But no pain no gain. Some people will have to die for the remaining ones to live well. The youth should get something better to do. Jakom is fooling them yet he's feeling good in Nairobi. How come his children don't go for nothing? What is it? Something is wrong with the chain, let me check. Where are you going? You bored your English vocabulary to town. I can't carry you and your opposing Jakom. This is why Luos are poor. As if you're an Indian. You can keep your money, Luos don't beg. And never assume that everybody here in the streets is uneducated. Some of us are more educated than you. It's just because of bad leadership. - Ten. - And more will still die. Are you celebrating? Look here Chalo, this presidency was never yours from the beginning. You'll continue crying that your votes have been stolen as we continue celebrating. I don't care who becomes the president. My problem is for how long will innocent people die? The day that they stop fighting over what doesn't belong to them. And let me ask you something, you as Mwas… Now that the government is yours, what achievements do people have that we don't have? Our son is sitting on the throne and that's all that matters. So you actually enjoy being a trigger monger right? The last time I checked, pulling a trigger was part of my job description. He who lives by the trigger, dies by the trigger. I pray that God forgives you. I think you're in the wrong job. Chalo, you belong to the convent or motivational speaking. A combination of this job, Jesus and salvation doesn't work. I've always wanted to be a policeman since my childhood. My mission is to protect the citizens, not to harm them. To me, it's a calling. Who called you? - Please call the next patient. - Thank you. - How are you? - We are fine. That's good. You are very lucky. Why? Look outside there and tell me how many women have been escorted to the clinic by their husbands. None for sure. Is it out of love? You can say yes and no. Why? I think it's because this is our firstborn. This is your firstborn? Imagine and we're this old. Such is life. I have had four miscarriages. God gave us this fifth one. It's okay, let's talk later. She's over-suckling. I want to stop her from breastfeeding. Hey… Stop it. She will get fat. No, actually I want Joy to breastfeed up to secondary school. In fact, you'll go visiting to breastfeed her there. You always amuse me. Look at these people. You're joking. Njoro, haven't you heard the army have split in the barracks? And three-quarters of them are on Jakom's side. You… you guys are dreaming. You're dreaming. Have you asked yourself why Trump came to Tanzania? Let me ask you… did you see that Trump? Did you see him with your own eyes? I saw him on TV. Even if we saw him with our knees or legs… the most important thing is… swearing-in will be done in Tanzania. Kabisa two. After swearing-in, Magufuli will escort us with his army up to the state house. Do what you want. Giddy, wake up from that dream. In fact, piss off outside. You'll cry until Jesus comes back. You'll cry and cry and cry forever. Stupid! How can this man from central talk to me so foolishly? What? Hey? Hey? Giddy beat him, don't spare him. Hey, hey hey! This kind of stupidity is the reason you can't lead this country. You will never lead this country. What are you trying to show me? Hey, hey, hey! We're live and I want to hear your views on the ongoing chaos. Your name, please? - I'm Nyangi, the ghetto boy. - Yes. What is your opinion of the ongoing chaos? Let people fight, let us fight till we respect each other. Things have got out of hand. Enough of this disrespect. We should continue fighting whether people die or not? Look here, man… Let people fight and die. We can't be waking up early in the morning to queue when they rig our votes. They'll be surprised. And is it true that you take part in the riots because you're idle? Look here, we're idle. Are you employed? And you? We are jobless. We've never found a leader in Kenya who is concerned about the youth. And it's us, the youth who advocate for such leadership. - Yes. - And how do you advocate through riots? Look here, man. Where I am, I can't reach the leaders in the capital. Did you see the riots that took place here? We'll be seen on TV and that's how we can communicate with them. That's how we'll communicate. Get out! Sit down! Guys, this man cannot talk this badly and it's our people dying. Please, please, please… Let's kill him! What has he done? This man is talking ill of Jakom. Jak… Jakom? Please don't kill me! Have you forgotten me? Who are you? I am Njoro… I have been here with you since childhood. Giddy you too? Giddy, Giddy, Giddy! And we've been staying like brothers… Calm down. Don't shed blood. It's not our culture. Otile, this guy cannot talk to us badly just because we grew up with him. Let him go talk badly in their home. It's okay, I understand you. But let us not turn our fight from good leadership to tribal wars. Nooo… Otile go away… we don't need your English here. Leave him… leave this guy alone… Move closer brother. How long do you think these riots will last? Okay, Bro, am I on TV? - Madam am I on TV? - You're on TV. - You're live now. - Okay that's good. Let me tell you, we're in the hands of Jakom. If Jakom tells us to stop rioting we will stop. And if he says we continue, we will. Who are we to refuse? And if Jalom tells us to walk naked now, we will walk. Hey! Hey, you! Kill him! Take it, easy guys! Relax! Keep quite! Let's sympathise with them. What sympathy? Why don't they sympathise with us? Are they blind? Listen. Listen. These guys are someone's parents. They've just been sent by their bosses. They just want to make a living. If we kill them, their bosses will still send others to kill us. - Ah! - No… Take it, easy guys. Let's do this. We'll push this car out. You and you let's move behind… Otile stop being stupid. You expect us to help the enemy push out the car? Stop being stupid. Don't pay evil with evil. Hey you, let's hold the back. I am leaving! Let's hold them back. Let's go. Let's hurry. Faster, faster. Come. Let's hold it. Just hold it, hold it. Okay, let's go. - Okay. Harambe! - Hey! - Harambe! - Hey! You guys should buy a new car. Open the bonnet. Your pliers. Start it. Is it okay? Thank you, guys. God will bless you. You're the one who should ask God to bless you with a good job so you stop chasing innocent Kenyans. Let's go. You'll know who we really are. I saw you helped them to repair the vehicle. Are you a technician? I'm an engineer. If I say I am a technician maybe you'll think I repair bicycles. No, I'm an automotive engineer. Certificate or diploma? Dip what? Are you drunk? Young man, I have a degree in automotive engineering. You see, you see. In Kisumu, if you have a diploma you are considered a schooled Luo. - What? - Yeah man, I'm a complete Luo man. Full of nothing. Charisma. Wait, wait. In fact, many tribes were called but Luo was chosen. But who said? - Don't. - You say, "Oh my God." And I know you're wondering what a graduate is doing in the streets, huh? - Yes. - I am not alone, we're many. We've gone to school. Sounds funny, right? Jobless graduates, huh? We are angry with the way things are. We are frustrated with the system and we are worried with the direction that this country is taking. In fact, I hate this government and I'm purely in the streets to vent my anger to them. - Yes! - Yes! But why, why? Because they tell you education is the key. But they never tell you that the government already swallowed the padlock a long time ago. - Yes. - Yes. My people. Look at how they're killing our people. They're slaughtering them like chickens. Mzito, is this true? Very true. If you see anything trending on the Luo Lives Matter page, it's not propaganda. You're our Member of Parliament and we trust you. Thank you very much. You have to trust me and I can't lie to you because I'll come back here to ask for your votes. And you're the ones who will vote for me again. So, there's no need to lie to you. Are you listening? Now… from tomorrow, if you see their shops… destroy them and burn them. We will burn, you've said it, that is it. Take it easy. The time has come for everyone to go and do business where they come from. - Yes. - Yes. Because they've despised us to the extent they want to vie for political seats in our home. Mzito, that can't happen. It will never happen. Never. Waiter? Waiter, come here. Bring them five litres. Give me the money. Five litres. - Mzito, Mzito! - Five more. It's okay now. Archibela and Giddy, you know how you'll share this cash with my people. - Mzito, Mzito! - Five more. Thank you very much. Does Mzito always go to the riots with you? Hey! Waiter, your work is to sell alcohol. So just sell us alcohol. And if you want to oppose our MP Mzito, we'll baptise you afresh and call you Njeri. And then we'll do the things we've been told to do to the tribe of Njeri. - Is that it? - Give us alcohol. Okay, I'm sorry. Let me bring you your alcohol. Where is the boss? The boss is still in the office. Am I done, I want to go home. Okay. Where do you think you going to? Home. Go back, we don't have money to contribute to your funeral. Go back. This is milk. I'm sure my child is crying now. Did the mother lose her breasts? Dan, it's not safe outside, didn't you hear the gunshots? I was born in this town, no one can scare me. Dan. Dan! Create a Whatsapp group and start funeral contributions for your friend. This is the problem of having only one child. - He only has one child? - Yes. The wife has miscarried four times and gave birth after the fifth attempt. No wonder he has refused to use his brain. Jakom! May you live long, Jakom. You've made me own a fridge, something I've never thought of. Where are you going and where are you from? I'm from work, heading home. Work? Why? Because… because I have a lot of… Can you hold this… hold this. What is this? That's milk. I'm taking it home to my child. Who told you I'm not a child? Sit down. That's my transport to work tomorrow. We are fighting for you and you have the joy of going to work? You think you really know how to build this country? Sit down! Sit down! - Sit down! - Let's burn him. Where is the matchbox? No, no, no! No! Stop it. You just build the country, we will paint it. Stand up! Stop looking at us! Leave this place! Run! Pure lies. There's nothing like that. Well, sir… Human rights reports show that over 100 people are dead. Death is inevitable. People have been dying with or without post-election violence. Well, but the deaths in question here are connected to police brutality. Propaganda. Alright, why are the police using live bullets instead of rubber bullets on innocent citizens? Innocent citizens? These thugs who break into other people's shops, you call them innocent citizens? Criminals must be dealt with like criminals. But it's their right to picket, Sir. Everyone has a right. Or the ones who break into their shops only have their left without a right? Are you aware there was a secondary school student who was shot dead by the police? Listen. My boys are not mad. And innocent people are not on the streets right now. They're shut inside their houses. Listen. I have a lot of work to do. They're beaten. What's so funny? Look at how the fools are being beaten. Are you celebrating when people are beaten? Yes. They should be beaten. What did they go and do in the streets? You mean, even the ones that are killed just look good to you? My sister, stupidity meets stupidity. Aren't these the same guys who looted my bar and carried away all the stock? Aren't they? The problem is you forget very fast. Have you forgotten it's a Luo who helped you when you were almost killed by a mob? But my sister, these people know very well the police have guns. But they still fight them carrying stones. This is not the battle of David and Goliath to be won with stones. This is a government war. And we are the government. They have to know it's our son who is sitting on the throne and he is going… nowhere. I really sympathise with you. Kindly fill me in. Now that our son is the president, how has that helped you as Njoro? It has to help me, as long as he's our son. They will riot, they'll die then they'll calm down. And we'll come back to open our shops to sell to them as usual. Oh my God! I warned you against this, your Luo boyfriend a long time ago. This uncircumcised tribe are all fools. The stupid one here is you. That Luo you're calling a fool has a degree in automotive engineering. And you? The only certificate you have is a birth certificate. I know I didn't go to school, but I have a certificate of a single business permit in the shop. Is that not a certificate? You always sound smart when you shut your mouth. And you? Dad sent you to university to get a degree. And you only came back with a very stubborn Luo boyfriend. I really despise being your sister. Oti, pick up your phone. How will he pick up when you've just seen him on TV beaten like a snake? What is it? Oti… Where are you? I am here. Okay, babe, I just want to confirm whether you're safe. I'm always safe. Don't worry. I'm sure you're not safe. I've just seen the police running after you here on TV. I'm not inside your TV, I'm in my house. In fact, you've just interrupted my sleep. I'm sure you're the one I just saw… Is your TV showing yesterday's news today? It's so behind. If you're safe then it's okay. Love you. Okay. You're very paranoid ever since they slapped you in the streets. Come here, baby. Once slapped, twice afraid. Yes, Sir. Yes, Sir. My boys will tighten up the operation. Right away, Sir. The boss says the "shoot to kill" order continues. Yes, Sir. Very well, Sir. That is an order from above. And no one questions it. Yes, Sir. Call Chalo for me. Sir. The boss is calling you. Chalo. When you signed up for this job, you knew you were going to be a policeman, not an altar boy. - Yes, Sir. - This is the last warning. Yes, Sir. This habit of sympathising with people when you go for an operation - is not what you were employed for. - Yes, Sir. Your partners are complaining that you're really giving them a hard time when dealing with the rioters. Yes, Sir. I mean… no, Sir. I only told Mwas to stop using live bullets and aimlessly killing people. I give orders here, not you. - Sir. - Yours is to ask "how high?" and not why you have been ordered to jump. Get out of my office. Hey man. Even the toilet people knock. I'm so hungry that I don't even have the strength to knock. Hey, Brother! You mean you managed to carry this thing from that place to here? What edible thing do you have inside here? Bro… this is not fair. Why did you carry this fridge all the way here yet you know you have no electricity? Just the same way you looted alcohol and left food. And now hunger has brought you to my house. Okay, okay. It's okay. We're doing fine, easy man. But turning a fridge into a suitcase… it's an insult in the fridge fraternity brother. This… is not good. Serve yourself. Alcohol on an empty stomach will kill you. Do you have matches? No, I don't have matches. Where are you going? I'm going to buy matches. Are you mad? It's very dangerous out there. I know. But I'm very hungry. I can't wait anymore. Okay. Alright. All the best. Bring me a cigarette. Nice. Look at this one coming. Where are you going? Stop! Where are you going? I've come from dropping a customer. - And where are you going? - I'm looking for customers. - Ok, you can… - Don't… Where do you think you're going? Do you think we are goats that eat grass? Chasing you all day on an empty stomach is not easy. OK, go, go! Take your bike and go. Stop! Stop right there. Come back here! Catch him. Fool. Catch him. There he is. Catch him. Where is that boy with a car that has entered here? - I haven't seen him. - Have you hidden him? Where? Where is he? Officers… he didn't enter here. - Here he is. - I'm not the one. - Get out. - I'm not the one. - Get out. - Why were you hiding? Why were you hiding? I was not hiding, I was not hiding. Please, you're killing me. He's not the one, you'll kill him… He's not the one. - Where is he? - Why were you running? Why have you killed my child? What has my child done wrong? Her skull is broken? Yes, it's a cracked skull. My child will be okay, right? Yes, she'll be fine. Impossibility is a myth. Yes, I'm in the house. No, I have not switched on the television. Oh my God! What has he done? Yes, I got the news, let me see what it is. This is what transpired. Can you tell us why you helped the police despite them harassing you? Because it was our common problem. What does that mean? What about this country like bad leadership. Corruption. We both have a common enemy and that's the government. The OCS is requesting anyone who can help trace one, Polycarp Otile, to avail himself to the nearest police station as soon as possible. Please don't kill me. I will not hurt you, I am not killing you. Keep quiet. Where is your house? This place is unsafe, I'll escort you. Let's go. Get in and don't open for anyone. Keep quiet. Leave me alone. Mwas… What have you done? Is she your wife? Mwas, at this rate I'm the one who'll kill you and leave this job. Kill! Kill! Kill! Cut him. Wait. Crush the head. - Is he dead? - Yes. This is dead meat. Let his partners come for his body. Hello, Mum. I'm doing well, Mum. No, I was asking, what business can someone do back at home, in case he resigns from his job? Oh. Okay. I love this job, Mum, but… But we're being forced to do what we didn't sign up for. I didn't become a policeman to kill people, Mum. Yes, Mum. A Kikuyu! Did they have to kill her? By the way. I have not listened to the news today, how did that case go? The court is done with the hearing, we are just waiting for the verdict. And do you see us winning this? Are you still doubting? Didn't you see those lorries full of evidence taken to the court? They even issued a court order for the servers to be opened. But I heard the server key has been misplaced. It will be found. Even if they don't find it, there are so many key cutters out here they'll be able to fabricate another one. The man. I'll die I'll rest. What's the matter? I have ridden this bicycle in all the corners of the town. To the extent, if I fall sick now and get taken to the hospital, they'll inject me in my legs. Why? They are afraid. They know if they inject my butt the needle might break inside. And imagine, I'm suffering like this yet my father sold all his cows to send me to college. He thought I would get employed and help him back. I wish he knew he would've slaughtered all those cows for my mum's funeral. We would have benefited. By the way, now that you've mentioned college. Where's your learned friend? - Who? - Otile. I understand the police are looking for him. Otile? What has he done? You haven't heard? In fact, I heard they are looking for him under OCS's order. What are you guys trying to say? What has Otile done? Could it be because of baby Joy? But he didn't kill her. We know he didn't kill her. But maybe they want to implicate him because he was at the scene of the crime. What? No wonder. I've looked for him twice in his place… but in vain. And his phone is also not going through. - Let me look for him. - Look for that guy. Satan! I was changing before I started looking for you. Oti. What have you done that you are being searched for by a whole police station? Even the OCS is looking for you. I swear to God I did not kill that child. We know it's the police, but you know the poor have no voice in this country. It's like they're implicating you. You know me and kids, you know my love for kids. I can't do something like that. I got into the house by default. Now you have to go into exile. I can't. I'm innocent. Look here, Oti. This is Kenya. Those people will arrest you and throw you in jail. Then they'll press your genitals till you plead guilty. And since you can't afford a lawyer, by the time you prove your innocence, you'll be history. Here, they decide who is guilty and who is innocent in the boardroom and not in a court of law. Now, where will I go? Go back to the house. Pack everything you need for survival. I'll take you to a hiding place tonight where no one will find you. Charles. This is my office. Then I'm in the right place. Propaganda. Sir… I was there when the "propaganda" took place. I saw that woman holding her baby to her chest, trembling with fear. I saw your boys mercilessly beat innocent beings in that house. I saw that child struggling to live. It was indeed a painful propaganda. Charles. This is war. And in every war there are casualties. Can't take part in this anymore. This is not the oath I took. I swore to protect these lives. These people you are defending, they throw stones, they rape and they loot... With all due respect, Sir, fill me in. Since when does a six month old child go to the street to riot? And does that child even know there was an election in this country the other day? It is what it is. You can't change the system. Neither can I be part of it. Since I can't fight them… I refuse to join them. Charles. Stop. Think about those who depend on your salary. Don't let your rage plunge them into infinite suffering. - I wish I had an option. - You do! Take a leave. Go rest. And when you come back, you'll have made an informed decision. Never make decisions when angry. Hi. How are you, officer? Will you manage how I am? I'm looking for a missing person. So did you come here to look for him or to report? Both, I don't know which one to start with. - How old? - 30 years. How does a grown-up get lost? Or did he run away from you? What's his name? - Polycarp Otile. - Pardon? Polycarp Otile. Polycarp O… The same Polycarp Otile that we're looking for? I'm not sure. Do this. Go and look for him. If you find him, tell him we're also looking for him. - Are you not helping me? - We'll have to help each other madam. Go look for him even through Google. If you get him, bring him here. Okay? Tell him we're looking for him. Where are we going? Bro. Bro. Bro! Bro. It wasn't me. I'm not the one. - Otile. - You haven't seen me. Otile. You haven't seen me. Hey, where are you going? I want to see the OCS now. Are you mad? Why do you want to see the boss? Are you the boss? No, but you have to start with me when you want to see the boss. What's your issue? I want my child. Is he lost? You guys will have to give me my child even if it means killing me. Are you haunted? I'm not understanding you. I have not come here to be understood. I want to know what Joy did for you to kill her. I want my child! What is it? I want my child! I want my child! Get your filthy hands off me! For the last 20 years, I've been having sleepless nights looking for a child. Then God gave me Joy. And you… You… You… you decided to kill her! In our own house in her mother's arms. You killed her! Do you even know… Why… Why I named… her Joy? Are you even aware… that she was my… only source… of joy. Maybe… Maybe… She was guilty. Guilty. At six months. God… Created an accident. That should decide… Her death sentence. My baby! God. God… opened… doors… of my happiness. And you… you… and your boys… decided… to close it. This one? No, the one I am looking for is a man and this is a woman. Can we go check on the ladies' side? Madam. Here there are no ladies and gentlemen. Here we just mix them like juice. And imagine they don't even care. Madam, look at how post-election violence has brought us a lot of business. Just imagine… this guy. He committed suicide because his wife left him. I can't do such a stupid thing. Me? Commit suicide because of a woman? Now, imagine you've left your wife for that man officially. - Madam. - Yes. Not all those killed by the police are brought here, some are thrown away. - Where? - I don't know. Maybe in the lake. Maybe he has been swallowed by a tilapia. Here it is. Here it is. You've got a long way to go. Diana. Have a safe journey. - Are you sure? - Njoro… go home safe and send my regards. Diana… I also thought we were safe because we grew up here. But you also saw what they did to me? If you really love me as your sister, help to look for Otile. Diana. Did this Luo man give you a love potion? Huh? Let's go home. Just go. How will you reach? There's a truck driver who has agreed to hide us inside the tank up to Nyeri. They can't stop a vehicle with sewerage. I… Will look for Otile till I find him. Dead… or alive. Even if it costs me my life. Diana. We bring you some breaking news… Baby Joy will be buried this Saturday 22nd this month… Baby Joy was killed by the police in the post-election violence two weeks ago. She will be buried in her home village in Siaya. We send our condolences to the family of baby Joy. Hello. Yes, this is Otile. Yes, this is my new number. Yes bro, I just heard about it. Just now on the radio. I'll have to come. I know it's risky but I'll have to come. Giddy, look here… Listen… Giddy. If I don't come and apologise in-person to baby Joy on her grave… This whole thing will haunt me for the rest of my life. I'll take care, don't worry. Okay. Trust me. Yes man, her death has given me a very different perspective in life. Yes, I have to change a lot of things. Man, I want to live a good life. Okay, fine. Today is Joy's last day on earth. To the parents, we know that you loved Joy so much. We also loved her. But the Almighty Lord loved her more than us and that's why He's taken her today. And so I would like to ask Joy's parents, Jacky and Dan… I would like to ask them to release Joy to go in peace. We're here to console with the bereaved family today. And I would like each one of us to pay their last respects to our daughter, Joy. We can now lower the coffin. You have eaten already. Bro, you have eaten. When did I eat? You have eaten. You think we don't know how villagers behave? You eat, go back and change clothes then come back to eat again. Get out of the line. Take it easy, bro. Why are you hiding then? What do you want? Polycarp Otile. What do you want? I'm Charles. A police officer from Kisumu. Why have you been hiding all along? 'Cos I'm innocent. Innocent people don't run. Look… please let me go. No one will know you found me and let me go. I swear to God. I did not kill her. I know. - I was there. - If you were there, why haven't you told these people that I am not the one who killed this child? Please don't shoot. I don't have any weapon. Is this a trap? The OCS was impressed by your actions of saving the drivers. And he also learned that you are a jobless graduate. So… He's considering offering you a job. That's why they're looking for you. But peace is a good thing. True… I'd rather be broke but have peace. There's a day I slept hungry yet I have a thousand shillings in my pocket. But it's the civilians who are always stupid. We are fighting and killing each other down here, while they are meeting and eating at the top. How do you know that? Hey bro. How would they have greeted each other without meeting? How did Otile's issue go? Otile has landed a very lucrative job. He's now the chief automobile engineer. He's in charge of all the police vehicles. I understand he's paid handsomely. He even has a car and a personal chauffeur. He's just driven around. But education doesn't expire. Who would have known he was a graduate? Now people like us who thought the school is a residential plot and the headmaster is the landlord. We'll have to eat humble pie. Giddy, now that your bicycle counterpart has left you. You should now at least upgrade from a bicycle to a motorbike now? You can go to hell… monkey. Your motorbike is so old that a customer has to get off on the hills. In fact, this is not a motorbike. This is a bicycle that has grown fat. But it is using fuel. The only thing you own that makes a sound is your stomach. So, um… After considering the evidence tendered before this honourable court by both the prosecution and the defence… this court finds Constable Julius Juma and Constable Henry McKenzie… Guilty… of the murder of baby Joy… contrary to Section 203 of the penal code, Chapter 63 Laws of Kenya… and they are hereby each sentenced to life imprisonment. All rise. Yes.
