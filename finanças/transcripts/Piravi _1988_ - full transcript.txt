Library 'The Birth' -Marar, does the Library closed so early today? -Wind makes the things there worse. -Are you going to the other side? I'm going to market. -Why to the market? -Bus may be late today. -It'll arrive at sharp 7.10. Today Raghu will come. In his letter, it is said that he'll come by today's last bus. Rain hasn't come. It'll come late. Father Has Raghu come? Not yet mother. He may be with father. Isn't Raghu in the bus? Today's newspaper. Give it to Marar sir. He went to house so early because of the fear of rain. It's ok. I'll hand over it to Raghu's father. -What is this? Is there no rain here? There was heavy rain before arriving here. -Anyway, by driving bus in rain and arriving a place that has no rain is a relief. -Yes, big relief! Hari, didn't see him. Hasn't Raghu come? Maybe.. he didn't say anything to me. Thought he is in this bus. Has son not come? I come back after taking them on the other side. Don't worry. He'll come tomorrow. -Was Raghu come with that group? -No, he hasn't come. He also said nothing. -Can you wait?, i'll look there one more time. -Isn't that boy said he didn't see Raghu in the bus. Then why..? You please come. You don't need to fear about it. There may be some reason for him to not come today. What reason he should have? Doesn't he know this old man will get frightened? Raghu will come. There is bus on tomorrow and day after tomorrow. If you paddle little more fast, i can see Hari and ask him one more time. It's too late. How can we ask him at this time? I can't stand because of the corn on the foot. Let's go back. Shall i return? See you tomorrow. -Has Raghu come? -No. Waited for so long. That Hari also hasn't said anything. -Has Hari come? He may have come. Doesn't he know the thing about tomorrow? Did you look there well? In this darkness, you too want to go there and look for him? Then look. Father hasn't wash the legs. Give me the shirt. Will bring water for bathing. Isn't today's date is 17th? -Yes. -So the date is also correct. Only very much oil in the bottle. Raghu will bring it when he comes. Unni (nickname of Raghu), don't run like this after applying oil. Your sister can't run along with you. You think you can run all the time? I won't let you go anymore. -Father, water is ready. -You go and sleep kid. Cold water is enough dear, let everything get cool down. Don't go for new habits. Father, the heat of water will lose. Mother, with this disease, if you don't eat tablets.. Very few of it is remaining. Only get when Raghu comes. So i.. What is that sound? Has he fallen down? Lord.. Kid, how many of it has you lightened? Three? There is not much problem in my eye power. Hasn't Unni said, there is a date for my cataract surgery? He'll take me only to a hospital that don't hurt me. She also has come early. I told her about the Bride Seeing. Go to uncle's house and tell him to postpone the date. Raghu hasn't come. Without Unni, nothing goes well. -Why he hasn't come? -You go there quickly. I will fall down, after walking through all these paddy fields and climbing hills. That's not right. Let them come. Malathi is saying.. He's not on the chair. Where has he gone? What..? Bus is only at evening. What happened to him? There is some problem..else he was not like this. -Give me a tea. -Let the water boils. Haven't i told you the bus is not at this time. No need to wait for him here everyday. He'll come. It's because of your compulsion, i come with the canoe this early. It's not right waiting for the bus here, while people come to see Malathi. Without my son's coming, what is the use in coming of any others? -The service of morning bus has stopped. -You're the one who is showing quickness. Being late one day is common. I'm sure Raghu will come in the evening bus. What's the time right now? What the hell is this? Telling them to come, then telling not to come. How things will happen if you behave like this? How many of the same is happened up to now? What if, they don't want to come another day? The thing you did is rogueness. Without Raghu how things will happen? Along that, what if a fear also emerge? Then i will be like a dead body. What all things are these people saying? Why you keep locking Raghu's room? When he comes, the room will be seen in a dirty state. I think they will not come. Do sister has nothing to say? -Who is behind you, like a shade? -That's me itself. Sister, have you noticed the door you entered? Opposite that, have you noticed the arch made of laterite stone, and the beauty of light falling on it? Look through this window. Look how the things outside, the front yard, red soil path..are beautifully connected; same like the relationship of us who live inside. -What you mean? -I'm trying to relate the old vastu shilpa and new engineering. Sometimes i think, the old ones are always strong. -You're right. By standing from this ascension you should find new sciences. -Stop it you donkey. Is this a fire service lorry? -Many are catching frogs behind, they should also hear it. You said you are in a leave today. No need for the leave. Is a brother of teacher studying for engineering? -Yes. -What is his name? -Raghu. -What is the matter? -I asked for no particular reason. It's difficult to get such a seat nowadays. Teacher hasn't signed. I went to that Hari's house again. The people there don't even think a human was come to see them. Since my Raghu is studying with their Hari, to where i go to enquire about him first? He'll come by this bus..sure. -What is the balance? -3 rupees 20 paise. -Here it is the 3 rupees..everything right? -Got anything? -Why not? Am i the Conductor?! Father, don't you want to bath? Two Pushpanjali and one Mruthyanjaya homam. Lord.. You hasn't said anything, though father visited you many times. Now i'm in a self purification mode. And under a 'home jail' too. These vazhipadu (offerings) are made by my mother, for the escape of me from bad friends. Today is Raghu's birth star. Where is he? Tell me the truth. Don't you know anything? Something has written in newspaper. Lord..my brother.. Before the exam ends, police came and took Raghu. They are from special branch. Four men including Raghu was in the group. How can i say these things to your father? There is nothing in it. That's in it. Why didn't you tell about it? I'm unable to tell it. At least, for that much time you two don't feel sad. At least, we could do something. In newspaper, it is said that they released him in the next day itself from the custody. I thought he may went back to college without coming here. He was your only son. I've heard everything. Never mind what it is written in newspaper. Should search Raghu. I'm going to Thiruvananthapuram. This is my leave letter. Please tell it to the head master. Don't forget. You should come early tomorrow. I need to go to Thiruvananthapuram. Take care. -Shankara, the heat of tea may have lost. -With this feet i need an hour to walk a feet. -Shankara, i need to say something to you. The coins you give me to keep is filling the bag more and more. I fear to keep it here. -Is your bag full? If you consider your daughter as my daughter too, then problem will be solved. Decided to go early morning, so that will not miss the bus. Since i lost my sleep, i don't miss the time too. You're lucky. Here is the bus. Without walking more, you can travel effortlessly and bring Raghu back. God is with you. Are you going to Thiruvananthapuram? That Nambeeshan is the minister now. Devaki Aunt's family helped him for studying. Go and meet him, and tell about those. He will help. Wake up. Shankara, my father is still thinking i'm that small 'Unni'. He gets terrified even if i'm late for a very few minutes. I was born to him at his late age. May because of that he's more affectionate. -How's your foot corn after applying the medicine i gave? -Feels better, but don't know what i do after the medicine gets finished. -Don't worry about it as long as i live. I'll bring a new medicine for you next time. -Is the Swami of Ulsava Madom still the owner? -Yes. But he is on his deathbed. -I arrived here and met him, when the king ordered me to come. So many years have passed. -Only this is left for him, everything else is taken by the government. Bathroom is downstairs. Omanathinkal Kidavo..(a lullaby) [Memories about Raghu's childhood] Is it Kurup? They are ready to give two cars. Bring your other 'party' too. It is very cold in Thekkady. Should take what all we need. Kerala Government Yes. This is Home Minister's house. He went to a conference. Will return after 2 O'clock. He went to a conference. Will return after 2 O'clock. I've sent that file to office, Sir. Secretary will reach at 7 O'clock. I've collected all the files. Yes. I'm Nambeeshan. I'm going to meet the Chief Minister afternoon. Everything should happen.. will happen. Have you eaten lunch? I'm going to Delhi this evening. Let's do one thing. I'll give a letter to I. G. (Inspector General). Just give it to him. Draft a letter to I. G. Don't allow anybody to come inside for 5 minutes. -Give this to I. G. -Where is he? Don't you know I. G.'s office? Show him the room of D. G. P. (Director General of Police). Go with him. Sir, the man which is said by minister is coming upstairs. The things are already finished. He's not in our custody. The police here had taken him. Hey..they didn't take him like that. May called him just to ask something. But there is no records regarding it. Don't worry, he will arrive there soon. Until now, he hasn't reached. He was the only one i have. Please give him back. If need, i give another letter. He'll come back. I'll inquire. Bless you. For this great heart, God will give what you deserve. They are the ones who tell us to take under custody and handle. But when we handle, the story will end. Since they knew it well, then why sending these old men to here. -His family gave support for the studies of the leader. -Then why don't consider it as a payback? Is Raghu here? Who hold my hand? -Have you seen Raghu? -He's not with them. They already released him. Nobody took him under custody. -Who said all these things to you? -I.G. -What if that was a lie? -Lie? For telling lie, are they put uniform and sit there? -What you inquire actually? They took our Raghu. That's the truth. But they told me, they released him. Then, where is he? To whom you ask all these? Is it a lie they told? Do you remember that Nambeeshan who tied a golden chain on Raghu's waist on his birthday, when he was a child? He is the minister now. Did he knot it on my neck actually? Not enough sugar. You should have told me when sugar is finished. Instead of it, don't give sugarless tea. Is Aunt inside? Has Raghu arrived? I came here for a help. Mother is seriously ill. How can i go to school, by leaving her alone in the home? -So what she is suppose to do? -Don't get angry at her. -Where is Janu? -What is the benefit in it? She's not a relative. Can you sent Savitri to there for help? No. I'm not ready to sent my daughter for such a help. I already got ashamed from all these. Enough? -Never mind the shouting of Uncle. -I thought Aunt would sent Savitri. -She'll sent her. Sure. -Father is very tired too. Hope Raghu will not disppear from us. I feel scared teacher. -Don't worry. Nothing bad will happen. -I'm going to Thiruvananthapuram. Need to find him. -When? -Father believed everything they told. His pain may be a joke to them. -You go and meet Raghu's friends there. They won't tell lie to you. Hey, come and look. A chick has come there. On college day, Raghu mock minister through a song. That was the beginning. Johnny is the last one who came out from police custody. He said, Raghu was in the lock up. I'm going to see a lawyer. Can you help me? -But they told they didn't take him under custody? -There may be witnesses. -To whom these witnesses should tell the truth? To police? They are the one who took Raghu. -What should i do? He's the only one who we had. To whom i should ask about him? I need to see his room. Dear father, exam will end soon. I've bought the medicine for mother. Met the doctor for the surgery yesterday. Tell mother, there will be no pain. I'll come on 17th. No need to come and wait for me in the market. I'll come by myself. People who come to see sister.. Bought the medicine for mother. Met the doctor for the surgery yesterday. Tell mother, there will be no pain. I'll come on 17th. No need to come and wait for me in the market. I'll come by myself. People who come to see sister.. There will be some way. After college reopens students will arrive. May i tell a doubt? But don't feel hurt. [Memories about Raghu's childhood] Did they tell you the same lies, which they told me. Lord..i don't have the strength to reply. Yes. Only expect Raghu will come. Please don't wait for him all the time like this. What? No need to wait? Then why i'm his father?, Why she is his mother? Why you are his sister? And telling not to wait! Lord.. Swelling in stomach. Very much pain. Everything will be alright. Don't fear. Tell the kid not to cry. Bus will arrive soon. Teacher.. Raghu..so you came at last. Hold my hand strongly son, so that your father won't fall down. Devaki, Unni has arrived. Malathi, here is your brother. Come fast dear. Sister is eagerly waiting for you. No need to wash legs, Unni. You come inside. He only was in the bus. There was no other passenger in it. Are you happy now? You feel very sad by waiting for so long, is it? Raghu, seek the blessing from your mother first. Why are you silent? He seeked my blessings. Devaki, we don't sent him anywhere anymore.
