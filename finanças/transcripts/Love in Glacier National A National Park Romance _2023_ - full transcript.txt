Sure is humbling to see, isn't it? Always is. What was the top speed? Got that at 122 miles an hour. I think we got all the data we need. Okay. Well, let's pack it up, then. It's so early to be seeing such extreme avalanche danger. Yes. Snow's come early this year. Have you seen weather patterns like this before? Well, not exactly, but similar. Weather patterns are changing globally, so it's all a bit new to me. I'm gonna get a coffee. - Can I get you one? - Sure. Thanks. Dr. Lawrence speaking. Heather, it's Eric Johnson. Eric! How are things in Fernie? Actually, that's why I'm calling. I'm listening. I have a big favor to ask. Please tell me you're joking. I know, it's bad timing. Bad? We are supposed to leave tomorrow. Couldn't you go in a couple of weeks? They need me to install the forecasting equipment and train their staff before they open the backcountry to skiers. Of course, they do. The weather's been out of whack recently and it's become a whole insurance thing for them. Eric said it can't wait. Plus, installing my system on their mountain will be great exposure. Which is exactly what I need to secure another grant. I'm sorry to cancel, but I have to go. I was just so excited about spending a week in Maui. If I have to listen to one more model tell me how to do my job, I am going to lose my mind. Plus, Charlie and I could probably use a little break, it's been intense for us. How's everything going with that? On the fertility front? Well, nothing to report, except I am out of money and this my last shot of getting pregnant. Which I thought the Hawaiian weather and time with my sister would help with. Well, why not just come to Fernie Glacier with me? It'll be just as good. Just as good as warm sun and clear waters? Yeah. They're putting me up at this five-star resort... Well, in a mountain-five-star sort of way. What's the weather in Glacier right now? Last I checked, it was 12 degrees. Uh, no, I can't tan in 12-degree weather. Come on, Riley. It's been forever since we've been on a sisters' trip. And Fernie is one of the most beautiful mountains on Earth. Well, I'm not arguing that. I have to work, but we'll have so much fun. We'll go snowmobiling, dog-sledding, skiing, hot-tubbing. Ooh, maybe I can set you up with some hot, rugged-mountain type. Okay, that wasn't exactly on the list. Well, it should be. Does that mean you're coming? This is exciting. Oh, this looks great. See? Who needs Hawaii? Oh, it's so beautiful. - Heather! - Hey! Eric! - It's so good to see you. - It's so good to see you! This is my sister, Riley. Riley, this is Eric. We're friends from college. Oh! How good friends? Heather actually introduced me to my wife. No way, she introduced me to my husband. Oh. Avalanche expert and matchmaker? You got a pretty nice resume, Heather. If only she was as good at matchmaking for herself. She's still single, I take it? - Mm-hmm. - Still happily single. Still using the same lingo, too, huh? Oh, my gosh, you're as bad as Riley. Come on in. Seriously, though, I really appreciate you coming, and on such short notice. With the storm coming in, flights are gonna start getting canceled, and I'll feel way more comfortable opening the backcountry with your forecasting system all set up and ready. Well, like I said, I'm excited for the opportunity. Well, with global warming and the snowpack this year, our insurance feels more secure with you here, too. But, mostly, I'm super excited about you training our Mountain Rescue team. You know, getting them up to speed with the advantages of incorporating your technology with their work. Once they see how it works, everyone will be on board. Yeah, um... I should probably fill you in on something about that. Uh-oh, what's that? Well, it's more of a someone than a something. You might get some pushback from our director. Why would your director give me pushback? It's complicated... But the good news is I think you might be able to win him over. Well, thanks for the heads-up. I'll do my best. You know, our Mountain Rescue team is doing an avalanche demonstration. Maybe you two wanna check it out after you get settled? Absolutely. Great. I'll check you guys in. Sounds good. Uh, hey, Jacinda, we got two new guests. Hi, how are you today? Good, thank you. I'm so glad we're here together. Me too. I mean, this place is cold, but it's absolutely... Hot, hunky, and super-hot straight ahead. Hello, everyone. My name is Chris Parker, and I wanna welcome you all to our avalanche-rescue demonstration. Great voice. Strong jawline. Five o'clock shadow. Bet he's super ripped under that jacket of his. Shh. Now, our avalanche dogs... Or "avi dogs," as we call them... Are some of the most important members of our avalanche team. Now, these pups... They're currently in training, but once they graduate, they will officially become part of Mountain Rescue. I know what you're thinking. "These pups are too cute to be rescue dogs." True, they're cute, but one day soon, they're gonna be out there in the backcountry saving lives. Now, this here is Mogul, one of our veteran dogs. There is nothing Mogul can't find that's underneath the snow. What do you think, buddy, you wanna try it out? Okay. Ready? Go get 'em! Nice. I've hidden a backpack in the snow that simulates a person buried in an avalanche. Now, Mogul is trained to sniff out and locate. Oh. Look at him go! Good boy, Mogul! Whoo! Atta boy. All right, can I please have a volunteer? Oh, get your hand up. - He needs a volunteer. - I don't want to. Volunteer for a ruggedly-handsome, great-haired, sexy-eyed mountain man? Please. Riley, it's not the time. Here's your volunteer! Right here. Great, come on up. Thanks a lot. You're so welcome. What is your name? - Heather. - Heather. Thank you for volunteering, Heather. Glad to be of service. Okay, what we're gonna do now is simulate someone being buried in an avalanche. Not sure you can actually simulate that, can you? Expert in the field? I know a thing or two. Wow. Well, I'm sure you do, but I think I wanna teach you just a little bit more. How's that sound? Well, all right, then. Okay. So, what we're gonna do is bury Heather in the hole, so we can demonstrate what an actual rescue is like. And just to clarify, he's not gonna bury me-bury me, there's a pre-built hole within there that I'll safety be in. I'm pretty sure they assumed that. However, it's never safe to assume anything when it comes to avalanche-rescue missions. That's true. Okay. Well, I want you to hold this. Okay? And hold this strong when you're rescued. You got it? Hold it strong? Hold it strong. Let's go. All right, well, there you go. Just feet first in there. All right, really good. Okay. You got this. Should you ever be buried in an avalanche, within minutes, you'll start to run out of oxygen. Now, most people in this situation will panic, which is natural, but remaining calm will preserve your oxygen and increase the amount of time you can survive under the snow. Now, these extra critical minutes gives us more time to get to you, which could mean the difference between life and death. All right, Mogul, search! Come on. Here you go, buddy. Nice. Nice. Good job. Oh, wow. Good boy! Good boy, good boy. Here we go. Oh! All right, let's have a big round of applause for our brave volunteer, Heather! Whoo! And for the heroes of our rescue, Mogul, and the newest member of our team, Bosco! Wow, very impressive. This is my sister, Riley. Oh, hey, Riley. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you! I'm curious. Uh, your gloves, do they, um, hold the heat? Hold the heat? Yeah, keep the heat. You know, are they... are they warm? Just, uh, thinking of getting my sister a pair. I don't need any need any gloves, Riley. Yes, you do. You think you don't, but you do. Uh, yeah, they're... They're great. They... They hold the heat. I'd... I'd recommend a pair, if you wanna get some. Can I, uh, try them on? Just for a second. A mere minute. Oh, yes, those are warm. Very warm. Dry. Plus nice hands, too. Big hands. Uh, okay. I notice that you don't have a ring on. Just not into jewelry. Oh. Like, you're married and don't wear the ring? Or... Okay. Don't mind my sister. My mom used to call her "Nosey Nelly". No, uh, just, not married, and, uh, just don't like jewelry. I'm married... happily married... But my, uh, sister here, AKA Miss Mountain Woman... Miss Mountain Woman? Well, I've never met a mountain woman from the city before. Back to assumptions, I see. Well, I've never seen you here, for one. And two, unless you live here... I don't think you really know much about avalanches. Which I indicated I did earlier. Heather actually knows a lot... Dad, I think Bosco might be hungry. Oh, hey, kiddo. Everyone, this is my daughter, Samantha. And she trains the avi pups. Wow, trains the avalanche pups? That's a very important job. Thanks. I like to think so. Oh, I like your earrings. I have the same ones. Oh, looks like we both have exceptional taste in jewelry. Seems we do. Well, it's nice to meet you, Samantha. Nice to meet you, too. All right, ladies, we gotta take the dogs back. I hope to see you guys around. You never know. Nice to meet you, Miss Mountain Expert. - Bye, Samantha. - Bye. Um... did we seriously just meet an ultra-hot, single mountain-ski dude that is totally your type, and has the cutest tween and dog one could ever ask for? First off, did you see how presumptuous he was? That was him flirting. That was him being condescending. Oh, come on. I feel like you say that about every guy that hits on you. Not true. That was not hitting on me. And you have no idea if he's single. All you know is that he's not married. And, as I told you before, I'm not here to find a guy. Yeah, you never want to find a guy, hence why you are perpetually single. Because I prefer to prioritize my work over men. Is that so bad? And spend quality time with my big sis. And, um, can we talk about your hormones? Because I know you said the fertility treatments lit them on fire. You have no idea. Aside from the fact that I think you drooled when you were talking to Chris. - Oh, come on, you didn't? - Mm-mm. Okay. There you go. You comfy? Mm-hmm. Okay, bedtime question. Tell me biggest thing that made you smile today. That's easy... being with you. Well, it's the same for me every day, sweetie. Anything else? Watching the dogs work. It's just so cool how smart they are. Dogs that save lives. Doesn't get smarter in the canine department than that. And I'm happy you have them. To help, you know, keep you safe at work. Hey, I'm as safe as safe can be, sweetie. Good. All right. Now, don't hold back and give me everything you got in the hug department. You're so strong. I love you, Dad. I love you more, sweetie. Okay. Night-night, okay? This place hasn't changed a bit. Wait, you've been here before? During college. Wes and I road-tripped out here once. Wes. Wow, that's a name I haven't heard in a while. What's he up to these days? Last I checked, he was married with kids. See, that could have been you. Would have made Mom happy. Seriously? What? Me being married to some dude who hates the outdoors and is a lazy thug would not have made Mom happy. You need to stop pushing that old-fashioned narrative about me needing or finding a man. You're starting to sound like one of those old romance movies. Relax, I just mean that Mom wants grandkids, and Wes could have been that ticket. Except you, my dear sister, are gonna be that ticket. So fill me in on that. Where are we at? Well, Charlie and I went to see the fertility specialist two weeks ago. Got that last batch of swimmers in and up, with the hope that it takes and sticks. This is the third round of IVF? Yeah. And the last. We've spent every dollar we have. We just simply can't afford to go again. Well, let's send positive vibes. I'm afraid we might need more than that. Hey! Hey, in there, little Charlie swimmers, if you can hear me, just head north, find those eggs, and settle in. You can do it. I know you can do it. Don't mind her, she's just directing my husband's swimmers. If you know what I mean. More water? All right, looks like everyone is all here. Before we get started, did everyone try my baking in the back? It's banana croissants and the theme for today. Look, I understand some of you are still skeptical about my baking from last meeting, but it's a hobby, and hobbies take work. And let me tell you, my banana croissants are tasting pretty good. Am I right? See, he knows. Much better than the peanut butter ones from last week. Okay, I'll just feed them to the dogs, and we'll get started. Um, good morning, everyone. Uh, I see some of you may have noticed we have a new face in the room. And not only is she a dear friend of mine, she's also one of North America's foremost snow and avalanche experts. Dr. Heather Lawrence is here to tell us about a system she developed that's gonna take avalanche forecasting and risk management to a new level. Something we all know is most welcome in this neck of the woods, and that's preventing the loss of life and keeping everyone safe. So, let's give a big, nice welcome for Heather Lawrence. Thanks, Eric. Working here in Fernie at amazing Rocky Mountain Glacier National Park has always been a dream of mine, so I was very grateful for the invitation. To fully understand what causes an avalanche, we begin with one of nature's most magnificent creations. Um, something so small, it's almost weightless. So intricate in detail, each one is an original and exquisite work of art. What I'm talking about, of course, is the snowflake. This is a stellar dendrite, one of the most beautiful of all snowflakes. But it's also the most deadly. On average, 27 people in the U.S. die each year in an avalanche. Unfortunately, that number is trending up. But avalanches not only take lives, but they destroy roads, disrupt commerce, and cause millions of dollars in damage. The economic impact in recent years has been significant. So, how do we improve our forecasting to save more lives and minimize damage? By collecting more data and utilizing the latest technology to process that data. Well, hello, sunshine. Oh, don't mind me, I was supposed to be in Hawaii, so just working on my tan. Yeah, sounds good. Talk soon. Okay. I just got off the phone with my colleagues in Yosemite, Grand Teton, Olympic, even Whistler Mountain, and they're all excited about what you're doing here. If your system proves to be effective, it's gonna be in high demand. I appreciate you putting the word out. Well, of course. Oh. And so, we, uh, built your tower and loaded the snowcat with all your equipment to get it up the mountain. Amazing. I'd also like to install these smaller monitoring systems in these other locations. It'll allow us to collect enough information to cover the whole terrain. Oh, I love it. And once it's up and running, we can open the backcountry. 'Cause we've had skiers practically waiting at the gates. And, unfortunately, we've had some boarders sneaking in to catch some fresh powder, which is always worrisome. I'm on it. Well, great. Uh, I'll get Chris Parker to take you up. He's our director. Actually, I think you've met him already. We have? Yeah, he's the one who did the avalanche demo the other day. Oh! Yes. Yes, I... I have. I didn't realize that was your director. Oh, he sure is. And, like I said, he's the one that needs a little bit of the convincing. So, it's pretty good that you two will get some alone time. Alone? Like alone-alone? Just the two of us? Just the two of you. - What's with the look? - What look? Oh, I know that look. - No, you don't. - I do. Chris, it's Eric. Dr. Lawrence is ready for you. He's single by the way. - Not that you asked. - I didn't. - Did you? - Did I what? ♪ Did you ever fall in love in a winter wonderland? ♪ You haven't changed a bit! Oh, I don't change nothing but my underwear, okay? ♪ I saw you last night outside the house ♪ ♪ Why you wore a suit I never found out ♪ ♪ Play ukulele ♪ ♪ Sweet time ♪ ♪ But I never look twice crossing the street... ♪ Okay, come on. I got ya. ♪ He took my keys and I slipped on my shoes... ♪ I got it. I really appreciate your help with this. Yeah, it's just part of the job. Of course. You know, in the mountains, there's no substitute for experience, knowledge, human intuition. People rely too much on computers these days. But up here? You rely too much on computers, it can cost you. What are you, one of those mountain-avalanche purists? You bet your butt I am. No disrespect to the work you do, of course. Clearly! Clearly. Anyway, the, uh, station is up there. Follow me? Mm-hmm. And there you have it. Looks perfect. Yeah, well, it better be. Cost a mountain to build it. Not that you asked, but just so you know, this equipment will send data to the server, where my algorithm will assess the avalanche risk, and give a far better reading than we've ever been able to achieve remotely. Huh. Well, I still don't trust it over my own assessment. And your own assessment being...? Oh, just call it the old-school way. First of all, we take the temperature from here. Then, over here, we have a magnifying glass to look at the crystals. And behind me over there on the boards, that's where we measure the new snow and the settlement. Then, with this, we take a sample and put it in a tube. We weigh it to get the water equivalent and density. And then we determine if there's a weak layer, which may cause an avalanche. Like you said, very old-school. Well, call it what you want, but I like to walk in it, touch it, taste it. You know, measure it in real life, not on a computer screen. Hmm. Fresh powder. Yeah. Yeah, the best of the best. But I assumed you weren't, you know, really a skier. There we go with the assumptions again. Well, I'm just saying, the mountain's... the mountain's pretty big, you know? I was actually hoping to get in a few runs. Obviously, not backcountry, but who can refuse powder? Okay, we can take a few runs. I'm sure I can get someone from the office to drive down the CAT. That'd be great. But you don't have your equipment, do you? My gear's in the CAT. So's mine. Okay. ♪ A time to shine Put off the light ♪ ♪ Keep on running to our destination ♪ ♪ Just like a girl so powerful ♪ ♪ We're the latest of the generation ♪ ♪ Nothing can hold us back with you by my side ♪ ♪ But do your voices sing... ♪ Hey, slowpoke. Slowpoke? Man, you've got some skills. I assume you mean as a skier? Yeah. Yeah, as a skier. But seriously, it's been a long time since I've seen such a strong female skier. Impressive. For the record, I'm just as good a scientist. Just saying. Thanks for your help, Chris. What do you think? Yeah, me too. All right, let's go. ♪ Nothing can hold us back with you by my side... ♪ Hey. How'd it go? Well... Actually, save it, we've gotta get going. Where? I booked us spa treatments. Oh. Riley, it's been a long day. Well, perfect. Hey, this trip can't all be about work. You promised me pampering. And you, my dear sister, need a massage. Twist my arm. Go get your bathing suit. Hurry up! Okay, you were right. This isn't so bad. I told you. Cheers! Cheers. Heather and Riley? Oh! - We're ready for you. - Okay. Right this way. It was a deer. No. No, I mean... Maybe it was an elk? No. Remember, elks' antlers go like this, deer antlers go like this, and moose ant... - Oh! - Oh. Ah... I'm sorry. It's okay. Hi, Chris! Riley, right? Good memory. Yeah. Hi again. Hi. My sister booked massages for us. I figured. Yeah, this is the place to come. I have a, uh, old injury and my back freezes up sometimes, so I come here to work out the tension a bit. Oh. Well, I hope our run today didn't make things worse. Maybe. Maybe not. But I would never tell. You're a pretty good skier, by the way. I don't think I told you that. Thank you. I appreciate that. Especially coming from someone who really knows her way around the mountain. Oh, so now I know my way around the mountain? Interesting. Mm-hmm. Um... Sorry, this is, uh, Sonya. Looks like she's gonna be your therapist today. She's the best. Great hands. Because I just got a session from her. Um... I'm gonna go. We'll, uh... We'll see you guys later. Yeah. Excuse me. Bye! - Bye. - Bye. Heather Lawrence? Yes, that's me. Come on in. Okay... Go ahead and lie face down on the table. Okay. So, how do you know Chris? Oh, we just, uh... we just met. I'm here doing work for mountain rescue and safety, and he was helping me out today. Oh, you just met? I thought you two might have known each other, the way you laid your eyes all over him. Excuse me? Looked at him, I mean. Oh. I didn't realize I was doing that. Like Kourtney on Travis. - Who? - Kardashian. Fave show. Got it. Um, is there any way we could go a little bit softer? Oh, yes, of course. It's just that deep tissue is kind of my speciality. Especially after a long ski day. Which you had today with Chris? Oh, no, it was just... it was just one run. How did you meet again? - Who? - Cute Chris. That's my nickname for him. Um, work. I met Cute Chris through work. Which is? I'm a scientist. I specialize in weather patterns, avalanche forecasting, and such. I see. I don't think I can do the deep tissue. He and I just went on a date, actually. Just one date, but it went really well. He's very nice. Very nice. I see. Nice is... is really good for a first date. We had sushi. It was fresh, you know? Caught straight from the river. I'm okay with farmed, but he likes wild. Which I love. Um... it's still a little too hard. So, tell me, how long are you in town for? Hey! What happened to you? Well, let's just say I need a massage from my massage. Why? Well, Sonya the masseuse seems to be as infatuated with Chris as you are. No way. Yes way. Remind me next time to steer clear of massages from girls my colleague is dating. Wait, it's his girlfriend? I don't know. She said they went on a date. TMI, if you ask me. She's probably just jealous. Why would she be jealous? Ah, please. And you don't think she noticed the way you two looked at each other? Talking about your ski day. Which, by the way, you still haven't told me about. But you two practically set off the fire alarm. The fire alarm? The fire alarm. You like him. No, I don't. - Yes, you do! - I do not. - Yes, you do. - I do not. You know nothing. I know everything, I'm your sister. And I know we need to go for a steam. Come on! Oh, it's Charlie. I'm just gonna get this. Hey, sweetie. Yeah, I miss you, too. Yeah. She's right here. Yep. Charlie says hi. Hi, Charlie. Hey, do you mind grabbing me something to go? I'll meet you in the room. - Yeah. - Okay, thanks. Yeah. No, I'm... I'm trying not to think about it. No, sweetheart, there's no positives. I would obviously tell you. Heather? Oh. Hi... again. Hey. Just grabbing some dinner? I am. Yeah. I was just admiring this photo. Isn't it epic? Yeah. Yeah, sure is. She sure was. Was? Regan was her name. She was a legend in these mountains. Died nine years ago. I'm so sorry. You knew her? Yeah. Quite well, in fact. Extra fries and extra cheese. Just the way the lady likes it. All right. Have a good night, man. Thank you. You too. Burgers and fries night for my girl. I see. Have a good date. Your neck okay? Didn't you just... just have a massage, or something? I did, yeah. But your date went a little too deep, so to speak. My date? Sonya. Extra cheese and fries. The massage therapist. Yeah, right. Speaking of, do you know where I could buy some Aspirin? You know what? I have some. Do you wanna... wanna come with me? I got ya. My office is close by. Oh. So this is your office? Sure is. - "Canine saviour." - Yeah. It's one of their avi dogs. They certainly do a good job of saving lives for us. I can see that. Okay, take one tonight and one tomorrow morning. - Thank you. - You're welcome. And you might wanna tell her that, uh, you just don't like deep massages. Oh, trust me, I did. Oh. So I'll see you tomorrow? For some more computer simulations and gaming? Can't wait. It's not gaming. Ish. It's forecasting based on science, based on data, based on proven algorithms. So I've been told. I don't get why you're so against it. Against it? Science. No, I'm not against anything. But I do know that weather is a variable that can't be predicted. It changes without notice. And science... well, science simply can't predict that. Well, it's meant to be a tool. A tool that you incorporate. Hmm. Listen, I gotta go pick up my daughter from music classes and get some food in her. Your daughter? I thought that food was for your date, Sonya. Wow. That, my friend, was a full-blown assumption. No, the only girlfriend I have in my life is my daughter. Not that you were asking. I wasn't. Oh. Okay, good. Come on. Dad, come on! I mean, seriously, it's Taylor Swift. She's an icon. Her new album... You have to get me tickets. Okay. Well, when do they go on sale again? And how much is this gonna cost me? Feels expensive. - Hello! - Hello? Sonya. I'm so sorry to just barge in here like this, but I didn't know who else to call. Dad, who's that? Hey, Samantha! Do you remember me? We met earlier this year at the salon when you were getting your hair cut. Oh, right. Yeah, you were getting some fake lashes put on, I think, right? Fake lashes? Kids these days. Uh, no, sweetheart, I was, um, getting a holistic hot-oil treatment put on them. So, Sonya, how can we help you? Oh, my heat's out and I can't get ahold of my landlord, so... Oh, that's... that's terrible. Yeah. Anyhoo, I didn't know who to call, as my sister's phone is off. And, obviously, I can't sleep at home tonight. Did you call a friend? Which your dad is. My new friend, in fact, who I like a lot. Anyways, I was hoping maybe I could sleep over? Help me out of a jam? Well, what do you think, kiddo? I think we should help Sonya out. I mean, she doesn't have a place to stay. Okay. I'll go get some sheets and a pillow for the couch. Great. Great, the couch. Nice place. - Thanks. - Yeah. Yeah. You put lipstick on before bed? I've never seen that before. It's called "plumper". "Plumper"? Makes your lips look fuller. Oh. If you have flat lips, you put it on, and... voilà. Here, let's try some on you. Um, is it a chemical? I don't know. And who cares? In the name of beauty, let's do it all, am I right? Um, I think my lips are okay, actually. I don't want it. I have an even better idea. Let's give you a full makeover. Go totally glam... Every girl's desire. Thanks, but no thanks. Oh, and the couch is all made up. I see. Well, thank you. Okay. Good night, Sonya. 'Night. Oh. Thank you for letting me stay. But are you sure that's where you want me to sleep? Yeah, I'm sure. I'll see you in the morning. Glad we could help you out. Yeah. Great. Hey. What are you doing? Going to talk to my dad. I think he's had a long day and maybe he's tired. Unless it's an emergency, I'd maybe say now's not the best time. Do the dogs always sleep there? Yeah, they do. You can slide to the other side of the couch if you want to. Okay. Go back to bed, sweetie. Please, please, please let this be for only one night. Eww, you guys stink. The pitch is 37 degrees. Mm-hmm. And based on the data, the program predicts which area is most likely to slide, which is outlined in red. The deeper the failure level, the more dangerous. So, how deep is it here? Four feet. So we're talking about a slab avalanche? Exactly. Okay. So, the starting zone should be here. This is the track and the runout. Let's see. Look at that. The program can predict when an avalanche will happen with a high level of accuracy, and without manual testing, so we're not putting anyone at risk. I'm all for that. Hey, Chris. Have you seen how this works yet? It's incredible. And accurate. Uh, I'll take a look a little later. I'm just gonna head up to rope off a couple areas. That's, uh, one job we're still gonna have to perform ourselves, even with Dr. Lawrence's forecasting. Touché. How's the neck? Better, thanks. Good to hear. I'll, uh, see you a little later? Maybe you will. Let's look at another example. Let's do that. Well, look who's here. All right, you wanna help me close the area? Okay, are you gonna help us too, buddy? What are you gonna do? We sure don't want any skiers in this area with such a high risk of avalanche. All right. I can't believe I let you talk me into this. You can't come to Fernie without putting on a pair of skis. Says who? It's gonna be fun. I'm exhausted already. Come on, we'll do one lap around. If you're not feeling it, we'll call it a day. - Promise? - Promise. Now let's go! Heather, wait! Yeah, Riley. Look at you! Am I doing okay? You're doing great! Okay, we're coming up on one full lap. What's the call? Uh, I don't know. What do you think? Well, cross-country skiing happens to be one of the best aerobic sports there is. And it's great for the glutes. Is that true? Have you seen a professional Nordic skier? Specimens of perfect health, inside and out. Okay, let's do it. Okay. Thatta girl. Okay, Heather, I don't think I can go much further. Okay, one more lap and we'll go back in. Hey, ladies! Oh, hey, Sonya. I know you're an alpine skier, but you're clearly not much of a cross-country skier. See if you can keep up! Don't worry about me, guys, you just go ahead. Am I getting snow in your face? Yeah, Heather! Yeah! Go, sister! What's the matter, Alpine Princess, you can't keep up? Let's see what you got. Come on, push! Don't let her beat ya. Come on, Heather! Come on! Almost there. Push! Push! Push! Ooh... looks like I'm the winner! Did that really just happen? Fire alarms. You'd be putting off fire alarms. Well, I'm definitely not a professional cross-country skier. Hey, I'm really glad we did this today, sis. It was fun. Really? Yeah. Even though she smoked ya. She did. She really did. Oh, I could really go for a donut right now. Have you ever had a beaver tail? Eww. What's a beaver tail? Oh, they're so good. Thank you. It's kind of like a funnel cake, but a different shape. Hmm. This is happening tomorrow. Oh. Well, if Chris is teaching, you have to go. I might. It'd be nice to see him in action again, you know? Get a feel for his technique. I bet you would. You're terrible. Now, I'm assuming one of the reasons you're here today is because you're all backcountry enthusiasts. But maybe each of you signed up for a personal reason, too. And if you did, I wanna hear it. If you're willing to share. Anybody? Yeah, I'll go first. All right. Uh, well, I didn't grow up skiing, or, you know, out here in the mountains. So, now that I'm out here, I feel like I need to gain some more knowledge and some more experience. So, that's why I'm here. Thank you. Yeah. I have two daughters that were involved in an avalanche last year. My youngest had to dig out her older sister, who was buried up to her neck. Turned out okay. So I'm taking this course, because I don't have that knowledge, and I wanna go skiing with them as a family. Thank you. Thank you. Well, last season, I broke both my ankles in the Pyramid gap. Luckily, my friends were there, and they got me out of there safe and fast. I'm looking to do this course, because I wanna be there for them if the roles ever change. Wow. Thanks for sharing. All really good reasons. And yourself? What brings you here this morning? Curiosity, I suppose. All right, then. Well, I appreciate you all sharing. What I hope to instill in you today is a healthy fear of avalanches. But, more than that, I want you to leave this course with a confidence in your ability to make the right decisions. Now, these decisions are not always the most popular, or that your fellow skiers or boarders wanna make, but it's those tough decisions that save lives. All right, everyone ready? - Yeah? - You bet. - Let's do it. - Okay. Come here. Hey, what's your deal? My deal? Yeah. I just wanna make sure you're here for all the right reasons. Wrong reasons being? Being critiquing my work. I'm not into that. I would never! I'm here to learn from you. Well, I hope you're not a disruptive student! I'll be on my best behavior. I promise. I hope so. All right, guys, let's go! Follow me. Everybody in? Oh, Mogul. Good boy. Good boy! Now, somewhere on this slope, I've buried a backpack with a transceiver inside it to simulate an avalanche victim. All right, now, just pretend this is your friend. Let's call him Steve. Okay? Now, when I yell "avalanche," I want you to grab your transceiver, and switch it from "send" to "search". Okay? Everyone got that? And you're gonna grab your probe, and then you're gonna go search for Steve. Now, as your transceiver beeps louder and louder, that means you're getting closer to Steve. And when your probe hits something squishy in there, you got Steve. Everyone got it? Everyone, just start spreading out a little bit. Very good. Very good. Okay, and... Avalanche! That's it! Good, good, good. Okay, on average, an avalanche victim will be buried under four feet of snow, so make sure you just stick that probe deep. After ten minutes, a skier that's buried under the snow... Their chance of survival decreases by 80%. So, keep going. Keep going. Just another foot or so! That's it. I think I've got him! I think I found Steve! All right, keep digging, keep digging! Time to dig! Oh, thank goodness, we found Steve! Oh, excellent. Yeah! Really well done, everybody! All right! Well done. Ha, ha! Fantastic. All right, everyone, gather in. All right, listen up. Megan's gonna teach us about the snowpack. So, today, we're gonna learn how to find weak layers in the snow. What we're really trying to find, if we have softer snow on top of firm snow, which would cause an avalanche. So we're gonna do that by checking out the resistance of the snowpack by using our... our hands and poking into the snow. You can also come on in and use the Popsicle sticks. Okay. Everyone... Come on in, everybody. You guys can use these Popsicle sticks over there. Do you wanna go over there? Okay, so, here... let me just smooth this surface out for you. What do you think? Solid? Or is that soft? It feels soft right there. That's true. Okay, how about down here, in this layer? That's a little... That's a little tougher. Mm-hmm. Learning anything there, scientist? Okay, let's try this out here. All right... ♪ Two kids, one crush ♪ ♪ Before we knew it we were deep in love ♪ ♪ Wheels turning as we pick up speed... ♪ So, what'd you think of the course? Honestly? I thought it was great. No constructive criticism? Mm... maybe one thing. Okay. Let's hear it. I think you should be willing to incorporate my forecasting program. Like, you know how I feel. Explain that to me again. Like, I just don't need a scientist coming here to tell me how things work. I know. - You know? - Yeah. - With certainty? - That's right. And you never get it wrong? Nope. Well, I guess there's no arguing with perfection. Exactly. You know what? I gotta pick up Samantha soon. It's the first day of ski school. Wanna join me for a few runs? Sure. All right. Let's go get Mogul. Mogul skis? Has he always ridden the lift with you? Oh, yeah. Ever since he was a little pup. Right, buddy? Aww. Yeah, it doesn't get any better than this. Nope. What are you looking for? Your girlfriend. My girlfriend? Sonya. Sonya? It's kind of weird. Well, she's not weird, but... she randomly challenged me to a race yesterday when I was cross-country skiing with my sister. So, I don't think she'd be too keen on us, you know, hanging out. Oh. Well, okay, firstly, Sonya's not my girlfriend. And secondly, aside from the one dinner date we had over a month ago, I have given her no indication that she's anything other than just a friend. Just not into her. Good to know. Yeah. Glad we cleared that up. Right, buddy? Hey, was that a fun run, or what? It was. Yeah? What was your favorite part? Turns. Yeah? How about you guys? What was your favorite part? Um, jumps. Yeah. That was really fun. Good stuff. Hey, kiddo! Hi, Dad! Do you remember Heather from the demonstration? Of course, I do. Do you ski? Almost better than your dad. Uh-oh, looks like you have some competition on the hill today. Oh yeah, seems like I do. Thanks a lot, Ange. No problem. She's good to go. - All right. - Bye, guys. - Bye. - Bye. So, good class? Yeah, snow was awesome! Did you and my dad ski together today? Not all day, but we got a few runs in. That's good. Hey, Heather, wanna go and see the Mountain Rescue pups? They're really learning a lot. I'd love to. Okay. Last one to the bottom of the hill owes me a foot massage. A foot massage? Yeah. Welcome to my single-parent fathering world of raising a mountain girl. - Shall we? - Sounds good. All right. Could these puppies be any cuter? So my dad was telling me you're a scientist? I am. Studying patterns of the snow, and predicting avalanches before they might happen, and stuff? Sounds like you study some of this yourself. Not really, but kinda. My mom was kinda into it. Or so I've been told. Is she still? Into it, I mean? No, my mom passed away when I was two years old. I'm so sorry to hear that. That's her, actually. Over there, on the wall. Regan was your mom? - You know her name? - Yeah. I, um... I was admiring her photo the other night, and your dad, he, uh... mentioned her name. But I... I didn't know that was your mom. Oh, hi, guys. Get 'em while they're hot. They give extra whip here at the lodge. This right here is the best hot chocolate in the world, Heather. There you go. In the world. Wow! It's really good. Uh, you just got a little... Oh! Oh. So, did you ask her? Ask me? My dad has something to ask you. Easy, kiddo, just give a guy a minute, okay? Um, I'm not sure if you've heard, but the Mountain Rescue fundraiser is coming up. Tonight. The fundraiser is tonight. Tonight. Eric mentioned something about that. It's here at the lodge, I think I read. Wanna come? Well, um... I, uh... There's gonna be singing and dancing... Although don't expect any Taylor Swift covers, I already asked. Mm. Bummer. And we have an extra ticket. Which he got today, hoping maybe you'd wanna come. You got me a ticket? He did. Well, I didn't... I didn't actually get a ticket. Um, there was just one left, and, uh, I didn't see your name on the list. So... So, he got it for you. Wanna come? Sure. I'd love to. Okay. Are you sure? Absolutely. I want you to have this night with Chris. I just... I have a feeling about you two. We're just colleagues. I'll admit, he's really cute, but I'm not into how he dismisses the work I do. It's insulting. Have you asked him why he's being so dismissive? I have. And he's yet to give me a real answer. Hmm. Well, maybe tonight is the night you finally get through to him. And, besides, it's gonna be a lot of fun! And you're sure you're okay with staying here? Are you kidding me? A fire. A hot bath. Movie in bed. That's my dream. When are you supposed to take that next pregnancy test? I'm supposed to take it tonight. I'm not quite ready. Well, no matter how that goes, I'm here for you. Thank you. Now, go. Go get ready. I have nothing to wear! Guess I'll just have to go through your suitcase. Just not my black boots. ♪ Just when you think ♪ ♪ That you'll never figure out where it's all going ♪ ♪ What it's all about ♪ ♪ You find the one thing... ♪ Dad, Heather's here! ♪ ...That opens up your eyes ♪ ♪ You stumble into something that's a surprise, surprise... ♪ Wow, you look beautiful. Not looking so bad yourself. Well, I do what I can do. Great turnout. Yeah, it's such a relief. I always get so nervous before these things. Looks like a lot of people understand the importance of Mountain Rescue. There she is! Bridget! Oh, I was hoping I would see you. I hear from Eric you are breaking some ground with your research. We have. We are. It's very exciting. Well, just wanted to pop over, say hi. It's so good to see you. We are almost ready. Yes. Um, I need to steal Chris for a minute, and I promise I'll bring him right back. Of course. Good luck. Thank you. Yeah, that sounds good. Okay. Heather! Here, I got you a root-beer float. You seem to like whipped cream, and they were making it fresh. Ooh, a girl who knows her drinks. Mm! Right? Thank you all for coming out tonight. You know, just about everybody who's been rescued in the backcountry has something similar to say. The experience made them realize just how fragile life is. They wanna do something good in the world, help people out. It's the kind of thing we need more of in this world, and that's exactly what makes us do what we do. Now, every year, we have more people coming into the park. And with more visitors... well, comes more accidents. People don't realize how dangerous it is. There is no safe backcountry. There is always a risk. We can't stop them from coming, but we can help educate them on the risks and be here in the event something bad happens. This leads to a greater need for mountain personnel, rescue dogs, and equipment. So, this year, we're kicking off our fundraising campaign for the renovation and expansion of our Mountain Rescue headquarters. And anyone who donates $500 or more tonight gets a guided hike to the famous Grinnell Glacier. And, I should add, it's most safely accessed by a Mountain Rescue escort. Five hundred! Wow! - Perfect. - One thousand! Thank you! Two thousand! Two-thousand dollars! Wow! That's very generous, thank you very much. Five thousand! Five-thousand dollars! Fantastic. Thank you very much. Very generous of you. Very generous Okay, time for the fun to begin! So, everyone, grab yourself a drink, and enjoy the sweet sound from the beautiful, talented Melvin. You know, Mountain Rescue's really lucky to have someone like your dad. Yeah. They're lucky to have you, too. You're really good with those puppies. Where'd you learn how to train them so well? Videos my mom made. She made these instructional videos for each pup she trained. She was really good at it. And when I turned six, I found them, and I started following her lead. And my dad thought I should take over. Well, I can guarantee you, she's incredibly proud of you. Thanks. You actually remind me of her... from the stories I've heard about her. Is that so? Well, you're a mountain girl, like she was, and you wanna help people, like she did. Exactly the type of person I wanna be when I grow up. Samantha, I can guarantee you, you're already halfway there, if not there already. Care to dance? I'm okay, but I think Heather does. Come on, you know you want to. Heather? I thought you'd never ask.

Before we wrap this thing up, the Mountain Rescue team and I have purchased a gift for two very special people... Our director, Chris Parker, and his amazing daughter and avi pup trainer, Samantha. We got them this amazing gourmet basket with goodies galore. So, Chris and Samantha, please come on up here. Come on, let's go. Whoo! You've been quiet this morning. What are you thinking about? Well, you know when you always say that sometimes people come into your life for a reason? I do. Well, dogs. But can it apply to people, too? I don't see why not. What's making you think about it? - I was just wondering. - Hmm. Hey, what do you say you and I make use of that gift basket, and take the ski-doo up the mountain to our special spot and indulge? Hmm? I have an even better idea. Okay, here I am. Dressed for adventure, like you said. Mm-hmm. Helmet. Where are we going? It's a surprise. You sound like your daughter. Whose idea this actually was. Really? She insisted we go on this date. This is a date? It is. You made an impression. Samantha likes you a lot. Probably 'cause you guys have the same taste in music. Ah. And because I like you, too. A lot. Come on, get on. You ready? ♪ Why should I worry myself for? ♪ ♪ Myself for... ♪ ♪ ...I'll think myself through a trap door ♪ ♪ A trap door ♪ ♪ White sheets... ♪ ♪ You told me ♪ ♪ That last night you dreamt of fire and rain ♪ ♪ You never dream at all ♪ ♪ Now I fear I'm the cause ♪ ♪ And pull myself away... ♪ All right. Okay. Oh, you brought the cooler. Yeah... for a picnic. Again, Samantha insisted I bring it. Oh... that was nice. All right, follow me. Ta-dah! Wow! Do you remember your first rescue? Yeah. Yeah, I do. I'll never forget it, actually. Can you tell me about it? Sure. Um... Well, I was in training, here in Fernie. My first year, right out of college. These, uh, high-school kids were looking for fresh tracks, and they ducked the rope. You know, sometimes, these local kids, they, uh... I don't know, they just get too cocky up there. You know? Anyway, there was this tree buried in the snow, and both of these kids skied right into it. One of them broke his leg, and... and the other just blew out his knee. Gosh. Yeah. If I hadn't seen their tracks on my last sweep, they would've been caught out there overnight, and they wouldn't have made it. They got lucky. Have you ever seen those boys again? Yeah. They're all grown-up now. One of them's a firefighter in Fernie, and the other one works for Mountain Rescue and Safety. How about you? I'm curious, what got you into this line of work? My college roommate. Jessica. We met freshman year and hit it off right away. She actually introduced me to backcountry skiing. You know those kinds of people you think can do just about anything? That was Jess. She was a force. And knowledgeable. I mean, by the book. One morning, Jess and two of our friends went up Loveland Pass. I would've been with them, but I was in an exam. Um, it got late, and they still weren't back. I almost didn't answer the phone when it rang. I just had this awful feeling. They were skiing the steeps. Jess went last. And there was an avalanche, and she was buried. They had beacons. Got to her in 12 minutes. But it was too late. Even with all her experience, the lure of that untouched powder was clouding her judgement. I'm so sorry. So, after that, I just threw myself into the study of snow and avalanche forecasting, in the hopes that fewer people would ever have to go through something like that. You know, I think... Jessica somehow knows what you're doing... and is honored by it. I hope so. I'm really happy I met you. Me too. Okay, here's the deal... for the rest of today, no more shop talk. Okay? Oh, what are we gonna talk about? Are you kidding me? I have so many questions to ask you. Like what? Like... Like, what's your favorite color? - Baby blue. - Baby blue. Okay. Well, that... that seems appropriate. Mm, this is the life. So relaxing. Have you ever done a snow angel before? A snow angel? Follow me. Come on. Uh-oh. Oh!! It burns! You're amazing. All right, here's another question. What talent do you wish you had? Mm. I wish I could paint. Really? Yeah. I mean, how awesome would it be to sit in a beautiful place with an easel and paint a landscape? Like this one. Right. Like live in the moment. Hmm. Never too late. True. So what about you? Oh. Uh, let's see... Any kind of musical talent. Like maybe writing a song. Oh. Do you have anything you wanna demonstrate? ♪ I'm sitting here with a girl ♪ ♪ In an unpredictable world ♪ ♪ Do-boop-boop... ♪ Maybe stick to the mountain rescue instead. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Okay. Okay, um... How about something you've never done. Fall in love. You've never been in love? Mm-mm. Why's that? Just never given myself the opportunity, I guess. Okay. Um... second part of that question... do you want to? Yeah. I'd like to know how it feels. Yeah, it feels really great, that's for sure. I had it once. With Regan. Yeah. How do you know her name? Samantha told me. I didn't realize that was her in the photo in the lodge. Yeah. Okay, last question... where are you the happiest? Easy. The mountains. Ah. You? Anywhere with Samantha. Mm. But... being up here with you ranks pretty high up on that list also. Oh, it's just an avalanche bombing. Close? No. No. So, what else you got in that cooler? Well, let's find out, shall we? Let's see... Oh, hey! - Hi, Dad. - Hey, kiddo. So, how was it? Riley's super cool. Just like Heather. Hey. So, good time with Dad? I... I did have fun. Yeah. Yes! Okay, let's go, kiddo. - Bye, guys. - Bye, guys. See you later. Bye. Oh, my goodness. Okay, tell me everything. You were right. Yes! I knew it. I've never met anyone like him. I know it sounds crazy, but under different circumstances, I could totally see us all being together. He and his daughter are truly one of a kind. If there's one thing I know, it's that these feelings, they don't come along that often. And when they do, that's your heart speaking. And when your heart is talking, you need to listen. Okay, Miss Matchmaker? Okay? Am I always right? - Not always. - I'm always right! You were right once. Oh, come on. Maybe twice. Hey, guys. Heather! Hey, Sam. I can't thank you enough for yesterday. Your dad told me that was your special spot. And now it's yours, too. Speaking of your dad, is he around? He's up the hill at his office. Oh, great, maybe I'll go find him. Wait! Can I show you what I've been teaching the pups before you go? I'd love nothing more. Okay, come on. Take. Oh, they're so cute. Knock-knock. Hey! Sorry to interrupt. No. No, it's fine. I'm just finishing up here. Did I just catch you working with my forecasting program? No, just finishing up a report. Oh. You know, um, I've trained everyone this week except for you. I think it'd be really nice if you gave it a chance. Look, with all due respect, as I said before, I... I... I just don't need it. What do you have against the work I'm doing here? Look, you know why. I don't trust technology. But why don't you trust it? You haven't given me a real reason. I trust the weather. And the weather is unpredictable. And it moves faster than your technology. And technology can't keep up with weather in real time. It just can't. I'm not arguing that it can. Okay. Well, then... just leave it at that. I can't just leave it at that. I feel like I've gotten to know you. I've been having so much fun with you. But this... this attitude towards my work... My... my life's work... It's... it's disrespectful. I can't help you with that feeling. Yes, you can! You can look at the technology and realize that we're on the same team. My work is about saving lives, too. Why aren't you getting that? Look, you just don't understand. Then explain it to me. I'm sitting right here in front of you. I'm listening. Make me understand why your work and mine can't co-exist. Heather, we're just not gonna see eye to eye on this. Okay? We're just not. Okay. Then, uh... Yeah, I guess. Bye, I guess. Whoa, wait. Bye? I'm leaving tomorrow, remember? And I guess... I guess you can just go back to making your assumptions. Which is all you seem to have for me. And, more importantly, my work. Which is based in science, but you don't care. And I see that now. - Heather! - Chris, come in. - Yeah, this is Chris. - What's your 20? Do you really need to leave? I think so. Are you sure? Yeah. You okay? Ish. Yup. Really? Right. Um, excuse me, driver? We should probably get going. We don't wanna miss our flight. There's a snowstorm out there. Your flight's been canceled. Canceled? The room is yours as long as you need it. Thanks, Eric. Chris and the other patrollers are out on a call, so I'd better get back to the office. What's going on? Two skiers are stranded near Apgar Gulch. One took a fall and is in pretty bad shape. I hope he's okay. Hey, I'm just gonna go back to the room and do some emails. Thank you so much. You okay? I'm okay. Wasn't successful with Chris, by the way. He could barely even look at my weather system. But you know why, right? No, I don't, actually. Aside from him being stubborn and disrespectful, I felt like we had a connection. His wife, Regan. It's about Regan. What about her? She went into the backcountry one day, based off an avalanche forecast she'd been exploring. And the area was supposedly safe, so she never really checked her snowpack, and then there was a slide. And the technology at the time was not what you have today. An avalanche. That's how she died? Now you understand. The weather's changing pretty quickly, so I'd better get back to the station. Thanks for telling me. He's worth it, Heather. He's worth you. Thanks. Oh, no. Eric, we have a problem at Apgar. Yeah, I spotted that, too. Have they found the skiers yet? Not yet. - Can I talk to Chris? - Of course. Heather to Chris. This is Chris. I thought you left? What's your 20? About 50 yards east of Apgar. Okay, stop right there. The snow on that side of Apgar is about to give. No, it hasn't slid in years. It's not gonna slide today. I'm telling you, the data shows it's ready to go any time. Eric sees it, too. Yeah, buddy, she's not lying. Test the snow yourself if you don't believe me. No, we don't have time. The guy's in bad shape. Then, please, you have to trust me. Do not cross Apgar. All right, what do you recommend we do? Get up to the ridge, and then descend from the other side, and approach them from the west. I can see the skier, he's just across the gulch, 150 yards from here. Please, just listen to me. I'm telling you, it's much safer from there, and then you have a clear path to ski out. What do you think? Chris, this technology's good. All right, we're going across the ridge. Over. All right, let's go, guys. Chris to base. We have the injured skier. We're heading back. An ambulance will be waiting for you at the bottom. 10-4. You were right, Heather. All right, let's go, guys. Is my dad gonna be okay? He's gonna be just fine. I know it might feel really scary, but you're a lucky girl. Not many kids have a real-life hero for a dad. Your system helped predict it. And knew something my dad didn't. Come on, Kevin, the ambulance is waiting. All right. See ya, guys. Dad! Hey. Thank God, you're okay. Always, sweetie. Always. I think someone else is glad you're okay, too. - Hey. - Hey. I owe you. - You don't owe me anything. - No, I owe you an apology. I can't afford a misstep up there. And, I admit, your forecasting system, it... it picks up on things we could miss. I get why you hesitated about it. Eric filled me in. You saved my life, Heather. You saved all of our lives. And, uh... I've been thinking. I don't want you to leave. I really don't. I don't think Samantha wants you to leave either. Maybe you just wanna base your work out of here? What do you mean? I mean, I'm sure Eric has an office for you. And I'll bet a full-time job. And you could obviously just continue your research. But, yeah. Move here. Be part of our team. I don't know what to say. That you'll think about it? I mean, professionally, it's a... a big decision. But personally... maybe not? Personally? Very personal. ♪ Turns out to be an amazing life ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Turns out to be an amazing life ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Turns out to be an amazing life ♪ ♪ Turns out to be amazing ♪
