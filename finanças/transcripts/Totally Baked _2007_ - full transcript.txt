(triumphant music) - [Narrator] In 1632, Andy Dufresne left Shawshank Prison wearing nothing but- - No, no, no, Morgan. This is an indie job, my friend. (triumphant music) In 1632 pilgrims brought the first cannabis seeds to the United States. (audience laughs) - Marijuana is not a drug. It is a plant that is growing in my closet. (audience laughs) - You can't get rid of it. You know why you can't get rid of it? It's a weed. (audience laughs) - And weed should never be expensive. To me, weed should be like a lawyer. You know, if you cannot afford some... (audience laughs) Some is appointed to you. (audience laughs) - [Interviewer] So to begin with, have you ever smoked marijuana? - (scoffs) - Yes! - Yeah. (smokers laughing) - I'll smoke to that. (school bell ringing) - I teach high school, everybody, I'm a high school teacher. My students can always tell when I'm high because it becomes movie day really quickly. (audience laughs) - I totally stand against this friendly, happy, feel-good, pro-marijuana culture that's out there. - We're getting fed up with these Washington Nazis. - Everybody's so different, 'cause some people really like it, and some people don't. - Let's try to minimize something that I'm sorry to say, is deadly serious. - Do I find marijuana to be an aphrodisiac? Hell yeah. - (laughs) - Oh, yes! - [Woman] That's how I roll. - Pot makes me horny. - Not for me, no. - Really? - Yeah. - They try to tell you that marijuana is not a gateway. It's a huge gateway! - Gateway drug. - Your gateway theory. - It's possible to just be a pot smoker. It's not necessarily a gateway drug. Sometimes, the gate is locked, and I stay happily within my perimeter. (audience laughs) - Persistent marijuana use leads to the same kind of chronic lung issues. I'm talking about persistent cough. (smokers coughing) (old-timey car horn blares) - I love my marijuana the same way I love my wife's pussy, with purple hairs on it. (audience laughs) A little stinky, I'm a bit freaky like that. - It causes huge lapses in judgment. - You fucking idiot! - You are, like, so high. - These bitches be high on the hookah! - Hookah pipe. (gavel banging) - Never use your stoner buddy for a reference. When the guy called, he's like, "Yeah, Dan's all motivated and shit. (audience laughs) (inhales deeply) He don't even smoke that much weed." - Early adolescence is an especially dangerous and vulnerable time. - My daddy said he tried it once. - We were just messing around. - I can see that. Johnny, go home. (jail door slamming shut) - I'm a multitasking pot smoker. It's true. Just the other day, I was walking down the street, I was putting eye drops in my eyes, I was talking on my cell phone, and I was getting hit by a car. (audience laughs) All at the same time. - You wouldn't let your kid go out and eat a bunch of deadly nightshade or hemlock. - I knew in sixth grade, like, I was like, "I'll probably smoke pot." - Marijuana. - Well, it's not for kids. - Pot. - I didn't like it at all. It was in a garage with a bunch of kids. (jazzy music) - Jazz musicians and fat girls in Camaros always have the best pot. (audience laughs) - And yet you conveniently let him smoke marijuana. - Our daughter is using mind-altering substances! - You never experimented as a kid? - You can decide to break the law and eat four pot brownies too. - [Politician] Now you can sit here and try to tell me that marijuana is a friendly, fun, silly, little drug, and I will argue that you are dead wrong. (businessmen laughing) - Mary-ji-ji-wayne, huh? - So why don't we start thinking of the marijuana leaf the way we think of other leaves like the poison ivy leaf or hemlock or deadly nightshade? Because those are all leaves. The first one will make you itchy for weeks, and the second and third one will kill you. (gun bangs) (bong water bubbling) - Somebody hands me a marijuana cigarette, so I take this hit off the cigarette, this story officially begins right here, okay? (audience laughs) Are you all with me, all right? - All right, so this is a song we want to do before we get into it, and it's about, it's a song about every day, what happens every day in our lives.

(tranquil music) (birds chirping) - Meet Dave Bertman, a 37-year-old divorced father of one, a certified CPA, was captain of his college debate team, and is a reluctant masturbator. At the present moment, he's dreaming about salmon. (Dave moaning) (tribal music) - Say it. - Sinner. - Say it. - Repent. - Repent! - Say it! - Say it! - Say it! - Sinner. - But in approximately eight seconds, Dave will become extremely flatulent, at which point, he will awaken from his dream into a nightmare from which he cannot escape. (Dave farts) A nightmare, which ends in a deadly collision with his own- (Dave farts) Hypocrisy. (suspenseful music) (calm music) In a few short hours, Dave will be confronted with a choice, a choice his very life depends on. A choice, which could result in the total annihilation of all mankind. Okay, that's not entirely true. I have a tendency to exaggerate for dramatic effect when I'm doing this. It's an issue I'm well aware of, and I'm working on it. Plus, I'm slightly baked, so please bear with me. (doorbell rings) (soft rock music) - Shoes off. - Sorry, Dave. - Sorry? Don't be sorry. Just take your shoes off. Do you like the banner? (chuckles) Can you believe it's been 20 years since we've had the whole team together? - I'm really, really sorry, Dave. - What's going on? - He's alone. - Everybody inside! - What's going on? - Go! Go! Go! - What's going on? - I got carjacked. - Yeah, sorry about that, mate, I didn't have much of a choice. - Shut the door, shut the door! Where's the kitchen? I need time to think. Plus, I've got the munchies, I think. - The munchies? - Yeah. - Authorities have received no tips, however, on two suspects, seen escaping this warehouse. - Hey, that's us. - Where earlier today DEA agents discovered over 2,000 marijuana plants of this very potent G-14 strain. - That's federal G-14 medical seed, you twit! - Said he knew about the lab, used exclusively for terminally ill cancer patients and that federal agents have no right to intrude on a state's rights issue. - Federal agents have no right to intrude on states' rights issues! - Hard to believe that with this level of public outrage, activists haven't made more headway at the federal level. In any case, we will be following this story as it develops throughout the day, and we'll bring you breaking news as it breaks. But now, back to your regularly scheduled programming. - And now, it's "Mud Slingers" with your host Hack Murphy. - And welcome back to "Mud Slingers." Tonight, we're talking marijuana legalization. Should the weed be freed? We're joined by professor emeritus from Harvard, Dr. Willa Peterson, a leading marijuana rights advocate, and Reverend Elmer Finkle, the Republican senator from Texas and sponsor of the Milk for Cute Babies and Kittens Act, which is now being debated on the senate floor. Now, Dr. Peterson, it's clear you don't support this bill. - No, sir, I don't. - Well, I just can't believe how anybody could be against the Milk for Cute Babies and Kittens Act. - Well, sir, this bill contains nothing about babies or kittens. This is a bill proposing capital punishment for repeat drug possession charges. - Well, stand me knee deep in hog biscuits and call me Aunt Mary, aren't you just a fancy pants intellectual hippie? - All right, now that is plain, straight talk from an honest man. What say you? - Reverend, in appendices C and D, you suggest that the program be funded by diverting money from education. - Well, I just don't see how you can come on the TV with your fancy hair and oppose the Milk for Cute Babies and Kittens Act. - Sir, this is a law that would make it a capital crime to use a substance that is neither lethal nor addictive. - Ms. Peterson, I don't think you understand the effect that these drugs can have on my gated community. - On all of our gated communities. - I'd like to introduce you to a lovely woman whose life was ruined by your pot. Ms. Hallworth, tell them your tragic story. - My daughter was a sophomore in college, a beautiful young lady. (sniffs) her life was perfect until the day she was gang-raped. She was my beautiful baby, and now she's tainted. She's damaged goods! - How do you respond to that, Ms. dopey pants? - Oh, I'm sorry, did I miss something? What does this have to do with marijuana? - Well, this situation would have been a lot worse if your pot was legal. - You bet. - With all due respect, ma'am, your daughter consented, which I don't think you can really call rape. - How do you know it was consensual? Were you there? - No, ma'am, but I rented it. (Ms. Hallsworth gasps) - Ah! There you go, blaming the victim. How do you sleep at night? - The victim? She's listed as the star, the writer, the producer, and the director. - Oh! (sobs) - I hope you're proud of yourself, Dr. Peterson. - Hack, please. I came here today to participate in an intelligent, informed debate on the relegalization of marijuana. - Legalization? The Founding Fathers of this great nation must be turning in their graves! - Actually, Hack, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin all grew cannabis. - These men were also slave owners, Dr. Peterson! And I will not have you come on my show and advocate slavery! - Slavery? - Look, Ms. Peterson- - Dr. Peterson! - I am in impartial journalist, and even though I think you're a criminal with no values, I am willing to hear you out, and even offer you a little backup. That's why we have a colleague of yours here today. Fellow marijuana activist, Rusty Polten. - Hey, man, do bongs! Yo! Hey! - Oh, Rusty. - Yeah, yeah. - You share Ms. Peterson's views, yes? - Right on, brother. Yeah, I read some shit she wrote in Spleef Magazine, and I was like, "whoa." These fascists are trying to take our smoke 'cause they're just too old to party. - Everything that reverend, uh, establishment here, everything that he is selling is nothing but, you know, shake 'n seeds, man. - Is that right? - Yeah. - Shake 'n seeds? - Yes, it is. One acre of hemp equals, like 40, or like 50 barrels of oil. Something like that. And you can make a lot of really rad shit with hemp, like tapestries, my Hendrix tapestry, rolling papers. What else? You tell 'em. Hats, floppy hats. But you know what, we're getting fed up with these Washington Nazis. Yeah, well, the bong of freedom ain't cashed yet, man! Me and Willa here, we just packed it with some premium shit, man, and we are gonna make sure everybody gets a rude fucking hit, man! Whoo-hoo-hoo, pass it around! (bell ringing) (indistinct chatter) - That was great. - Thanks a lot, Rusty. You have just set the marijuana reform back another 10 years. - What do you mean, man? Come on. Come on, don't be that way. Hey, we just ripped these fascists a new one, you and me. We did it, we did it! - Rusty! - What? - Rusty! - What? - I know that you think you're helping, but I am begging you to please stay off my side! - Ah, come on, sister, come on, Willie. Hey, come on, don't be a buzzkill. Hey, let's you and me roll up a big spoocher! Yeah! Come on, girl! (Hack and crew laughing) (door thuds) (classical music) - Really excellent work again, Russell. - Thank you, reverend, I felt it went very well. I don't think that marijuana will be legalized anytime soon. - (chuckles) Really, that was just excellent. The president and the pharmaceutical boys will be very, very pleased. - Good. - Fantastic! Just a fantastic program, gentlemen. (chuckles) I don't know when those liberal hippies are gonna realize that America just doesn't respond to their message anymore. - Boy, you're not kidding. (men laughing) - Now, who wants to light up a fatty? - Sounds good to me. (door knocking) - I was the better natural debater, but Bertman got the captain- Hey, everybody, it's Captain Dave! - [All] Hi, Dave. - Hey, Skip, guys. - Hi. - Gosh, it's been a while. - Yeah. (laughs) You ready to party, Captain Dave, huh? - Whoo! - Who are the girls? (girls laughing) - I figured I'd bring the entertainment. I knew you wouldn't object. (laughs) - Oh. - You gonna let us in, Captain Dave? - Actually, no. I'm really not feeling well. The reunion's been canceled. - I see your position. However, I would like to direct your attention to the banner on your far wall. - Point. - Point to Skip. - I'm not debating you, it's just, you guys really can't come in. - Oh. - I just forgot to take the banner down. - Point for rebuttal. - Go, Captain Dave. - Well, if there's no reunion then what's with all the cars in the driveway? (girls gasping) - Yeah, yeah. - Match. - Match to skip. - Thank you. (laughs) Come on, captain, get out of the way. (guests laughing) That's why they say debaters do it better, baby. Captain of the debate team, you suck! - I won't stand to be patronized. - They have superior force. - I concur. - Is there still food? - Cell phones, please. - Oh, no, no, cell, I'd like to debate that point on the- Uh, good point, it has internet access. Come on, hey, cell phones, quick, please. - Calm down, just take a seat. They're not gonna hurt us. They're drug dealers. - Medical marijuana activists. - Medical marijuana activists, who just need a place to lay low for a few hours, and then they'll leave. - This is gonna cost you extra. - Is anybody else coming? - That's the whole team, I swear. (doorbell rings) - Ah! You, tweedledee. - Ah, hey. - You, get the door! Come on! Come on! Convince whoever it is to go away! - Mom, it's so humiliating! - You get back here, young lady, you get right back here right now, young lady! - Daddy! (sobs) - Jessica, what are you doing here? - I'm giving you your daughter back. - But it's not my weekend. - It is now! I have plans tonight. - Yeah, with Robbie Rock Cock. - Gina Marie! - I can't trust your daughter to stay grounded when I'm going out. - Grounded, for what? - For what? I found this (funk music) in her birth control pill case. - Birth control? - I'm so not having this conversation with you, dad. - And who is this Robbie Rock- (whimsical music) (Jessica wheezes) (electric guitar riff) - Dear lord. - Would you stay focused? Our daughter, our daughter is using mind-altering substances! God, I need a drink! (whimsical music) Ahh. - Can you explain this? - It's not mine, daddy! I told mom that! - I'm a trained psychotherapist, and I can tell you that denial of one's problems, very common. (whimsical music) - I'm not in denial! It's not mine! Ugh! - Well, you're the master debater. You talk some sense into her. I, ahh, am going to enjoy my weekend. (rock music) - Anybody gonna miss the tart? (reggae music) ♪ Mary Jane ♪ - Wow! (Doug sniffs) Oh, yes, Bubbleberry. It's the perfect hybrid of the award-winning parents, Bubble Gum and Blueberry. (Doug sniffs) Oh, semifinalist 2004, Cannabis Cup, very impressive. Perhaps I should hold on to this for further analysis. (Doug sniffs) (whimsical music) (Doug laughs) - Sometimes I smoke pot, and I'll go to, like a, I went to a Burger King, I go to Burger King sometimes to eat there because I don't care about my body. And I'll go to a Burger King, and I go to Burger King, when I go to Burger King I enjoy their chicken club sandwich which was available for a limited amount of time, but now it's made the jump to the permanent menu. And I think if we all work hard enough, we can keep it that way, so go out and do your part. Anyway, I go to Burger King this one time, and I can immediately tell I'm not dealing with Burger King's best and brightest. This is definitely not the Indiana crew with the AA degrees that they send off to the conventions. No, this is any big, inner-city, bottom-of-the-barrel shit staff, and I can tell right away 'cause they had along line of frustrated customers at the lunch hour, and then they have this short, chubby, bearded lady working the counter, you know, with the unintentional peach fuzz beard built over a long period of time, and you're like, "Fucking shave it, do something. Shouldn't a guardian step in with a Bic at some point and shave your monkey ass down?" But no, she's staring at me uncontrollably, you know, giving me the creeps, making me lose my appetite as I gradually pass through the line. I just want to get up to the front and say, "Nothing for me, please, I'm gonna take a pass on this one. I had an opportunity to look around your long-ass line, and I realized this place is a shithole." But I didn't do that, I didn't. There was other signs too. I peeped back into the microwave, knifeless kitchen, and I see that there's all Hispanics back there with English difficulties and attitude problems and, nobody tense up because I'm Mexican so it's okay for me to notice and mention that. And then, I see that there's a, (audience laughs) this bloodshot semi-retired drunk with a headset trying to hold the whole fucking thing together, so there's bound to be problems. Now, I get my chicken club sandwich, and everything seems cool, but the guy behind me, who uses no plurals whatsoever, this crazy Filipino guy just starts going nuts. He's like, "I ordered chicken tender, 99¢ tender, should be five fucking tender, but I just got these two huge tender stuck together. Like, two tender humping or some shit like that, and this is not my way, this is not my way. My way is five separate, delicious tender, not this teenage mutant three tender faggot bullshit." I was like, "fucking take it easy, yeah? It's just a fucking tender." (audience laughs) - When my grandfather, Harlan Funonion, set out to create the tasty snack food that illustrates his name, he could have selected a flavor that was more inviting. Cheese, chocolate, barbecue. But no. He went with onions. People said he was crazy. They said he was retarded. They said he was a douche bag, but was he a crazy, retarded douche bag, or was he a genius? That was a rhetorical question, you fucking gonad. My point is, he was thinking outside the box. My grandfather did not build fun-onions into a snack food empire by doing things conventionally. Now, we are in a real pickle here, people. With all this health-conscious craziness, it's turning into a real Snackwells motherfucker of a world. And we have learned the hard way that nobody wants a low-fat fun-onion. Now, this is Dr. Willa Peterson from Harvard. She is here to share with us a radical new approach to fun-onions. Ms. Peterson. - Thank you, Mr. Funonion. - You're welcome. - Folks, as your chairman has indicated, fun-onion sales aren't what they used to be. as you can see, over the last 10 years, pot and fun-onion sales are reciprocal. I believe that if fun-onion used its corporate might to legalize marijuana, your sales would skyrocket. - Sir, this is preposterous! The connection between marijuana and fun-onions is purely coincidental. - Well, I disagree with that, Sanderson. When I'm blazed off my ass I can go through three, four bags, easy. Sharana, honey. - Yes, Mr. Funonion? - Could you send in Mr. Goldman, please? - [Sharana] Yes, Mr. Funonion. - Ah, now this is Mr. Arturo Goldman of the famous PR firm of Goldman, Goldberg, Goldstein, and Goldman, and I'm told he could sell a rusty cock ring to a bull dike. - Oh, too kind, sir. Gentlemen, Mr. Funonion tells me that we need to change the way America thinks about marijuana. Well, when it comes to changing minds, my company is the best there is. I have personally overseen the PR campaigns for General Motors, ABC, McDonald's, and Asians. - Which Asians? - All of them. About 10 years ago, when you thought of Asians, what did you think? - Camera equipment. - Mm, pocket protectors. - Mustaches. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, no, no, I get it. I get it, computers, bowl cuts, small dicks. But what does this have to do with you? - Well, the Asians came to us in '96. They wanted a new image. We gave it to them. Now, when you think of Asians, you think of, (techno music) techno, hip-hop, big bucks, and plenty of hot backdoor action. - That was you? Oh, thank you! - Well, this is impressive. So you think that you can help us here with this marijuana business? - Oh, I believe I can. You see, gents, our voters want to keep pot illegal. Well, today, the religious right is running the show. So if you want to make a change, you first have to appeal to them. - How do we do that? - You have to start by asking yourself, "what does the religious right fear even more than drugs?" - Dancing? - Foul language? - The morning-after pill. - Hell, the IRS. - Oh, Jews. - Queers. - Ah. - My job is to convince the parents of the Bible Belt that marijuana use will curb homosexual impulses. You can sell them that. They will be scoring weed for their own kids just in case. It will be legal within a year, and then, my friends, fun-onion will regain its rightful place at the top of the snack charts. - Is it true? - Since when has truth had anything to do with marijuana propaganda? If they can use terrorists to scare people out of smoking pot, then we can use homos to scare them back into it. - Jesus Christ, this is. (staff applauding) Thank you, thank you! God damn it, it's about time I had something fucking happening. - Me, smoke pot, no. Well, I mean, I smoked it a few times, I'm not, like, against it or anything, but it just doesn't work for me. The times that I have, you know, it was paranoia, no effect, paranoia, ill, and then the last time, okay, well, I smoked a little bit of it, and my heart started pounding, my, like, limbs went numb. My tongue, like, felt like it was swelling up like when you go to the dentist and get that Novocain shot, thinking, like, "oh, god, I got to keep moving, I got to keep talking, or I'm gonna die," right? But the worst part was, it was a, it was a first date. "Will you come back to my place? because I just don't want to be alone right now." And I never smoked again. - Honey, can I come in? - Just leave her be, mate. - Excuse me if I don't take parental advice from a drug dealer! - Medical marijuana activist! (muffled rock music) (Dave sighs) - My daughter's a drug addict. - Kinda funny you're more concerned about a little grass than me having a gun. - Yeah, do you know how many people are killed each year by the accidental discharge of a firearm? (whimsical music) - Trust me, I'm bothered by the gun too. Okay, but if you're so concerned about my daughter, why don't you let her go? (hostages gasping and murmuring) - Look! We're not letting anybody go! But we don't want to scare your kid. - So you guys just pretend to have your little barbecue. Steph and I will keep the guns out of sight. As long as nobody does anything stupid we're not gonna have a problem! - We'd like to pass on a rebuttal. - I concur. - All right. - There's ads in the back of High Times Magazines for marijuana being sold without THC. Hey, people drink decaf. People drink de-alcoholized beer. All the bloating. No buzz. (majestic music) - My name is Jesco Rollins, and my family has owned and operated this farm for, the last 80 years. Now, there's been a lot of talk in this community about the legalization of marijuana. Now, some folks say it's got thousands of uses: makes sick people feel better, makes stronger fibers for rope, cloth, and paper. Now, marijuana's a profitable crop, even if no part of the plant is used, 'cause it fertilizes the soil, keeps other weeds from growing. And some folks say that if marijuana was legalized and taxed, it'd be a whole lot more money to build better schools and roads that folks around here and others sure could use. Yeah. Legalization of marijuana would be a $24-billion industry right here in the United States alone. It'd save a lot of farms, make a lot of people rich. But not me. Because this is not that kind of farm, and I'm not that kind of farmer. I grow fake pot, just like my daddy and my granddaddy did. For the last 80 years, here on the Rollins farm, we grow Tootie Puff, Warlock Smoke, and some of the finest strains of marijuana substitutes, guaranteed to be 100% legal and not to get you high. It's the life me and my kids were born into. But if real marijuana is legalized, it's gonna be the end of this farm and a lot of other farms like it. It's gonna be the end of an American way of life. Across this country, I know 35 other farmers just like me, and with no means to provide, I would have no other choice but to shoot my family! When people look at me, they say, "Hey, it's common sense to grow marijuana." Well, I look them right in the eye, and I say, "Common sense ain't American to me." - [Announcer] Paid for by, the synthetic fiber industry, national alcohol lobby, the American pharmaceutical political fund, and the Association to Keep Nonviolent Marijuana Offenders in Jail. ♪ I'm smoking pot ♪ ♪ I got my dick out ♪ ♪ And I'm thinking 'bout you ♪ ♪ And I'm thinking 'bout you ♪ ♪ I'm smoking pot ♪ ♪ I got my dick out ♪ ♪ And I'm thinking 'bout you ♪ ♪ Just you ♪ - Deviants. (rock music) - You guys up for a game of ring toss? - It is getting a bit nippy out here. - How, it's blazing hot. - (laughing) it's all over your face. - Where? - And so the reunion went on as planned. On the surface, a simple barbecue, but underneath, a danger lurked, which threatened the very fabric of the space-time continuum! Which is what I would say if I were still exaggerating, which I am no longer doing, so let's just say all is not well under the surface and call it a day. (rock music) (Skip clears throat) - Now, I know we agreed not to try anything, but a few of the guys and I, we want to go for it. - Forget it, Skip, it's too risky. - There's only two of them. - I'm captain of the debate team, Skip, not the wrestling team. I didn't bring home the state championship trophy just so I could bonk someone over the head with it when they didn't agree with me. - Agreed. We must do something, and we must concede that our weapons are our brains, not our fists. - Well, what do you suggest, captain? - Get them to see the error of their ways and turn themselves in. - I concur. (rock music) ♪ Hey, hey, who found the law ♪ - So how long have you two been drug dealers? Oh, I mean medical marijuana activists? (laughs) - How long have you been a total dickweed, Skippy? - I'm sorry, but you must admit that legalizing medical marijuana is just an excuse to make it easier for you potheads to get high. - Beer? - Yeah, sure. - We believe that withholding medical treatment from the terminally ill simply to stem recreational pot smoking is unethical, and guess what, Skippy? So do you. - Oh, so do I? (laughs) I think you two are about to get a little lesson in debate. You don't get to tell me what I believe, you have to convince me. And so, ugh. - Something wrong? - Uh, no, no. (coughs) Suddenly, I just feel a little... - Nauseous? - It's probably because of this, I slipped it into your beer. (Skip gags) You poisoned me? - Relax, it's just a little ipecac, used to induce vomiting in the event of poisoning. We find it nicely simulates the nauseousness of chemotherapy. (Skip vomiting) - Oh! Oh, at this point, your legal options for your nausea are pretty much your Compazine, your Ativan, and your Decadron! - Which can also cause acne, headaches, sore throats, unusual hair growth, and funnily enough, nausea again. (Skip retching) - Yeah! Let it go, baby! (Skip retching) But if you're willing to pay 40 bucks per pill and are okay with just constipation and headaches, then you got to go for your Zofran or your Kytril. - Unless you're one of those hypersensitive types, of which these pills could send into a potentially fatal anaphylactic shock. (Skip retching) - And that's assuming that any of these dangerous drugs work at all, which they don't for everyone. - Much less the 50 million Americans without insurance who can't even afford them. - Isn't it a shame that there isn't a cheap, essentially harmless alternative available? - Wouldn't that be nice? - Oh, my god! I feel horrible! There must be something I can take! - Sorry! (imitates buzzer) You're all out of options, the legal ones, at least. - I don't care! I'll try anything. (Skip retches) Oh, I feel like shit! (Doug humming) (majestic music) - Feeling better? (Skip coughs) - [Interviewer] So to begin with, have you ever smoked marijuana? - (scoffs) Yeah, I smoked pot, uh, every day, all day for about 22 years. There's three phases that I certainly went through. First, it was fun, then it was fun with problems, and then it was just problems. I went into rehab in 1990, okay, a 28-day program, but prior to that, about two years before that, I went to a marijuana anonymous meeting. That was my first introduction to a 12-step meeting. And I'm sitting in this big circle with about 40 people, and this guy's talking. I'm, like, two people away from him, right, and I remember it was, you know, he had this phrase that he said, he said, "I knew I hit bottom when I drank my bong juice." And I'm looking around. There's eight people shaking their fucking heads like, "Oh, yeah, I remember when I did that," you know? And I remember looking over at him, and I just said to him, "You drank your fucking bong juice?" And, you know, 42 people went, "shh!" You know, I didn't know the rules, you know. And there was, there was, like, eight or 10 people that had did, and I had made tea with mine, you know, 'cause I was classy. - Back in the day, we used to smoke a lot of weed all day. All day. Wake and bake, as they say. Put the bong in the freezer, get it cool, and get it going. Get it going early. I love to get high and watch "Wheel of Fortune." Really high. Right before a big puzzle. And then sometimes, it's down to one letter and I still can't get it. I'm just staring. "Bone with the Wind." "Bone with the Wind." "Bone with the Wind." Uh, I don't know, uh, "Bone with the Wind." I've done that, I've been there. Another friend of mine, he likes to watch the Weather Channel. And then he'll wait till I'm out of town and call me. "Dude, where are you?" (chuckles) "Cincinnati." "Is it partly cloudy?" "Fucking A, I knew it, man!" Gets all jacked up about it. Weed, makes the boring not so boring. This is really good. I'm not even that high. - And if you're some kind of religious freak and you think marijuana's wrong, may I please quote from Genesis 1 and 9, "all seed-bearing plants I give to you." (audience cheers and applauds) Namaste. (rock music) - Feeling better? - Yes, I am, Doug. But I still think marijuana should be illegal. - You do? - I mean, it should be illegal for pot to be illegal. (laughs) - I'll smoke to that. - Okay, it appears we lost Skip. - Obviously, we can't hit him on the medical front. What's left, Gouda? - Uh, lost productivity. - Loosening of sexual inhibitions. Oh, god, it's already started. - You guys figure it out. I'll be back. Can we talk now? - I can't believe it. Mom grounds me 'cause she finds some pot that isn't even mine while your friends are getting totally baked on the couch! - (laughs) okay, first of all, Skip is an adult. - Something for ya! (Skip farts) (Skip and Doug laughing) - Oh, oh. - Secondly. - Aw, come on. You never experimented as a kid? - Would you please mind your own business? - Well, did you? - (scoffs) (exotic music) - Come on. Try it. - Well, my daddy said he tried it once, so I guess it'll be okay. Oh, boys! whoo-hoo! Yeah boy! Hey you! I'll suck your dick for some weed! (chuckles) You, I'll let you ass-fuck me for a dime bag! I'm HIV negative! I swear! - No, I have never, ever tried marijuana, ever. It's a deadly drug that will ruin your life. - Oh, wow! I am fucked up. - See? (Gina scoffs) - Nice work, Skip. - No, man. I mean, I am really, really fucked up. - I can see that! (Skip laughs) - Won't stop me. (smooth rock music) In fact, I've never been this fucked up in my life. (Skip laughs) Hello. - Hello. - Who are you? - I'm your narrator. - My narrator? - Who the hell are you talking to? - Apparently, we have a narrator. (laughs) Television? - Good plan. - Indubit-bitably. (Skip laughs) - Hello, American men. Each day up on your 24-hour news channel you see hundreds of fundamentalist women. But oh, no, you don't see them at all. No worries. Ajmal is here, and Ajmal know what men want to see. Ajmal Kadivay present "Fundamentalist Girls Gone Wild!" These hot fundamentalist ladies are showing it all for the pleasure of men who buy videotape because these bitches be high on the hookah. - Hookah hookah hoookah pipe! - Yes, you get cheek, you get forehead, you get chin, You get nose, and you get plenty of sexy, happy, mouth. (woman ululates) For to see the eyes of such lovely women is too hot for TV. You got to order tape from Ajmal. And if you call right now, you're also going to get "Fundamentalist Voyeur Fantasy." Remember, fellas, these hot broads are the property of other men, but you can sneak a peek at sexy, sultry wrists and ankles, and nobody gonna know. So that means two hot and happy videotapes for price of one. - Hot and happy. - Ajmal been to America, and Ajmal understand, American sluts show filthy tit and butts all day long, so it's no big deal to see anymore. But fundamentalist ladies, you know this very, very special for you to see. This tape hot as camel's balls. - Camel's balls. - [Women] Camel's balls! - Ajmal just dub a new batch of top-quality tape from Talmart! I wait for your order now! (women screaming) - It's sort of an upside-down Q, some squiggly lines, something that looks like a IUD. - A four? - Oh, hell. (narrator snaps fingers) - Wow, that is so cool! - I'm good. - We got to get these guys out of here. Tell me you got something, Gouda. - Okay, we open with highway fatalities. Segue into public health costs. - Do a section on pot as a gateway drug. - Gateway drug, I like it. - Mm-hmm, then we end with the loss of productivity and the demise of civilization. - Perfect, brilliant! - I concur. - Hey, these brownies are really good. - [Debaters] Mm-hmm. - Who brought them? - I don't know. (gong rings) - Thought we'd contribute a little something to the barbecue. - You didn't. - You guys have such nice opinions about something you don't do. Thought a little personal experience might help you redefine your strategy. (spooky music) Boo! (debaters screaming) (rock music) (debaters panicking) - No! no! Bad brownie! - Why? - Ah! ♪ The shape was gone ♪ ♪ There were lazy people hanging all over the place ♪ - So Johnny Buskett's gonna sit there and tell me, Thomas, that he's never used performance-enhancing drugs? - Never, Tommy. - Thomas, ever? - T, what'd I say? - What'd I say, Thomas, Buskett, okay? - Let me tell you something, T. Weed is not a performance-enhancing drug, all right. The only way weed is gonna enhance Johnny Buskett's performance is if they start sprinkling chocolate chip cookies in the end zone. - Aha, so you admit to some form of drug abuse, don't you, Buskett? - Listen, T, you ever hear of Vicodin? You ever hear of Codeine? Man, those are gateway drugs, come on. - I got five words for you, JB, all right, five words, one for every suspension. Marijuana, class one illegal drug. - Oh, don't sing illegal to me. Isn't teenage drinking illegal? 'Cause that's how I remember when the Bush twins were doing it, they ain't go to jail, they got a Girls Gone Wild video. - This is not about the Bush twins, this is about Johnny Buskett. - That's right, and Johnny Buskett ain't doing cocaine, all right? I am Johnny Buskett, not Darryl Strawberry. After getting abused all Sunday afternoon, there ain't nothing wrong with going home, firing up a blunt, breaking out the Cristal. Gets me in the mood for my life and my wife. - Oh, I guess your wife, huh? You haven't heard about marijuana maybe being linked to impotence, have ya, JB, hmm? - Man, I don't know what kind of weed you been smoking. Maybe you need to check on some legally prescribed Viagra, 'cause Johnny ain't never had no problem with his Buskett. Now, somebody get this boy laid. (upbeat music) - Thanks for joining us. Today, I'll be addressing some of your letters about the measurements we deal with on the show. Now, if you're preparing an overdose using schedule one drugs, it's not so much the ingredients, but the amounts you want to be mindful of. Feast your eyes on these delicious spices of life. These are for my own personal canned preserves. Now, if you want to create a memorable barbecue overdose of cocaine, we always say, "less than a pinch will do the trick." An overdose can call for as little as 25 milligrams. Toot. A good way to remember is to think of a cornflake. Mmm. Now, I know some of you have tried overdose recipes using brown sugar, not that kind of brown sugar. This kind of brown sugar. Now, this is my own homegrown afghani heroin, but you can use black tar, china white, or some brown sugar from your local skag dealer. Now, that's a good thing. Remember, a little goes a long way when you're chasing the dragon. An overdose can come as cheaply as 80 milligraMs. Now, remember, a good way to eyeball this is to look at the markings on a syringe. It's equal to about the weight of half a peanut. I like to put a little H in anything. I could have it by itself, or with a little melted butter on movie night. Oh, I'm a heroin junkie. Remember, our federal government reserves schedule one for the most toxic illegal drugs. One would think with these substances that an overdose was easy to prepare. That's why I think this last ingredient shouldn't be in here at all. For a marijuana overdose, we'd need to prepare over 1,500 pounds of marijuana serve it smoked in under 15 minutes. (chuckles) Now, that would be a fatty. In fact, that's enough marijuana to equal the weight of these seven gorgeous hunks of man meat from the DEA. Or about a quarter million pot brownies. Oh, never mind the overdose. That would be murder on the thighs. No es bueno. (laughs) Now, with portions that size, marijuana just doesn't seem as dangerous as these other schedule one drugs. But I'm sure they have a reason. I'm not one to question things, especially not our government. That would make me a traitor. Thanks for joining us, we'll see you next week. - Come on, man. Do it again, do it again. - [Narrator] "There is no evidence that marijuana serves as a stepping-stone to other drug use. In fact, most drug users do not begin their drug use with marijuana. They begin with alcohol and nicotine." National Academy of Sciences. - Wow, that is so cool. - Went to Amsterdam. You might not know that they have stuff in Amsterdam that's legal that's not legal here. Little things like weed and prostitutes. I don't know how you feel about those things, but you know what they say. "When in Rome go to Amsterdam." (audience laughs) (acoustic guitar music) - What's wrong, man? - Dude, I think I see Hall & Oates. ♪ Oh, here she comes ♪ ♪ Watch out boy, she'll chew you up ♪ - I do, I see Hall & Oates. ♪ Oh, oh, here she comes, she's a man eater ♪ - It's Hall & Oates. - Man, you ever break your weed scale? (audience laughs) And have to go to the store and weigh your shit? All up in Safeway trying to act natural. (audience laughs) Sometimes, I wish I sold weed, you know, 'cause I would revolutionize the industry. Seriously, man, 'cause I would combine weed with snacks. (audience laughs) This is how it would go, some guy, you know, he buys an eighth. And all of a sudden, he's looking, and he's like, "hold on, Red. Now, what's this stuff mixed in with the weed?" "Those are pretzels, man." (audience laughs) I have a little bible in my back pocket, and it's not because I'm religious. Man, fuck that. If they didn't want you to roll joints with the bible, they wouldn't have left those last pages blank. (audience laughs) - Said it's like a burrito kinda. (laughs) - What? (Doug laughs) - How would you like a toke of my Big Bambu? - Ooh! Bambu rolling papers, that's how I roll. - (sniffs) Oh, yeah! That's some good shit rolled up in that herb. Double wide! - I have to reconcile smoking pot now that I have fucking kids and I'm trying to learn from that. I watched that commercial, you seen that fucking commercial where the dad goes in his teenage son's room. Brings a joint in, he's like, "where'd you get this? Where'd you get this?" Remember what the kid says? "It's yours, dad. I got it from you!" (audience laughs) If I was the dad, I'd be like, "well, give it back, you fucking thief. (audience laughs) I'll take my needles too."

God says, "well, take a vacation, go down to Earth for a while." "All right." Jesus goes down to Earth, he's hitchhiking. Gets a ride with a trucker, gets in the cab. They're going down the road. Trucker says, "man, it's a little warm in here. I got some Poland spring on ice, cold bottle of water?" "Yeah, that sounds good, sure." Down the road. A few miles down the road, the trucker says, "you hungry?" Jesus says, "I could eat." "My wife makes fantastic tuna fish, tuna on rye, lettuce, tomato, a little salt, pepper, you in?" "Sounds good, sure." "I'll give you half." "Your wife makes excellent tuna fish." "(scoffs) what'd I tell ya?" Going down the road.

(audience laughs) "You don't know who I am, do ya?" Trucker says, "No." He says, "I'm Jesus Christ. I'm the Lord, the son of God, Jesus Christ." The trucker says, "that's some good shit, ain't it?" (audience laughs) - They call me Count Smokula because I'm the smokingest dude on the planet Earth, and also because I'm from Smokesylvania. - Marilize legaljuana. - I'm doing my best to keep getting stoned - 4:20, 4:20, it's a theme in the pot community. ♪ Everybody wants me to leave it alone ♪ - It's the pass code. ♪ See, I'm smart in my noodle ♪ ♪ Especially when I get behoodled ♪ - Here it is again. Did you get it? - Rock and roll. - So my roommate is also a stoner. He likes to go to places where weed is a-plentiful and then mail it to himself where it's less a-plentiful. I'm not saying you should do that, but if you do, don't put your own name on the package. And don't put your roommate's name either, that's bullshit. (audience laughs) And if you're gonna make up a name, be careful of the name that you make up, all right? Smuggly McWeed. (audience laughs) The most annoying part about my stoner roommate is that he's always got to tell me his stupid-ass stoner fun facts. He finds out a fact and thinks that he's the first person to ever know it, and he's gotta run around telling everybody. He's like, "hey, Dan, did you know that your head is 20% of your body weight?" And I wanted to check to see if he was right, so I tried to weigh my head. I don't know if you've tried that, but you can't see how much it weighs. (audience laughs) Doesn't work, I just kept going. (audience laughs) Damn it! (rock music) - I'll be the Macho Enforcer! - And I'll be Rock Hard Willie Johnson! Gonna pound your ass, Macho! - Oh, yeah, Rock Hard? Let's get it on! (intense music music) - Boys! Boys! Oh, no, you don't, not on my watch. - Dad! Uh, we were just messing around. - I can see that. Johnny, go home this instant. As for you, mister, you're getting the bong. - Okay. - Honey, bring me my 5-foot matrix, pronto! - By now you've heard the exciting news that smoking pot cures most forms of homosexuality. And I'm living proof. I'm Reginald Stevens, and I used to be a flaming queen. But after smoking ganja daily, I'm as straight as Cher's pubes. So think about it, moms and dads. Do you want your boy smoking pot or smoking cock? - I know where we stand. - It's time to talk to your kids about marijuana and vote yes on Prop. 420. So light up, America, and put out the flame. - And cut! (bell ringing) - Ugh! - Is that true? Pot really made you straight? - Yeah. - For how long? - Since lunch, girl. - Oh, you're terrible. - A girl's got to eat, Dwayne. - Then there was that commercial, they're like, "If you smoke pot, you've helped murder families in Columbia." And I'm just sitting at home going, "what? I've never even been to Ohio, dude." (audience laughs) ♪ Different tokes ♪ (audience cheers and applauds) - Mark, Brian, would you dispose of this? - Affirmative, ma'am. - Exiting with the ganja. (audience cheers and applauds) - Are we in trouble? - No, Mikey. But if you keep messing with that stuff... You sure will be. - I didn't want to try it, Mrs. President. I knew it was a bad idea. - But did you know why, Mikey? - No, not really. - Marijuana is a drug, Mikey, and drugs are bad for people. Smoking marijuana will get you put in jail, give you brain damage, and if you take one puff, you'll never be happy again. - Like my real mama, the crack ho? (audience laughs and applauds) - Even worse than the crack ho. Just say "not" to pot! (audience applauds) (audience cheers) - Hey, Mikey. - Hey, Todd. The president's wife here was just telling me all about marijuana. - Well, it's not for kids. Well, your age I mean. But you know what? If you want to try it when you're older, think about it like it's ice cream. It's a great treat. - We've got a code red! - But too much of anything can make you feel icky. - Actually, Todd, we were just discussing how you should never use marijuana because it will kill you. Therefore potheads are suicidal morons! (audience laughs) - Really? - Mm-hmm. - 'Cause that's not what my pro-pot republican friend, Craig X says. - Just to introduce myself, this is Reverend Craig X from Temple 420, the General Farmer, out here fighting the good fight in this civil war we call the drug war. And whether it's, like, a Jewish wedding or a Christian wedding, we turn it around. Here's the christian side, it could be a podium, There's the Jewish side. And what's so great about temple 420 is you don't have to lie. You don't have to go, "Oh, dude, I'm sick, I need weed." Now you can say, "hey, I love the Lord, and I think cannabis is a sacrament." This is a spiritual inhalation device. We pack our bowl with the sacramental herb, the burning bush, and then we burn it, filtering it through a water filtration system, and this is a pull stem. "And that every beast of the earth and every fowl of the air and everything that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life. I have given you every green herb from me." God bless, amen, I'm outta here. - Craig. (audience cheers) - Actually, Mrs. President, even the long-term smoking, the daily long-term smoking of marijuana doesn't lead to long-term damage to the brain. The studies that show it leads to short-term loss of memory are false. What the study actually was, was they were giving a rhesus monkey with a tiny, little head a quarter pound of marijuana to smoke in an hour. Even I'd pass out. The fact is, a lot of intellectuals, including astronomer Carl Sagan and conservative pundit William F. Buckley are both pro pot. (audience applauds) - well, Mikey, it just goes to show you, you can always find a whack job to back up any kind of hooey. (chuckles) But facts are facts, and smoking marijuana leads to harder, more dangerous drugs. - Your harder drugs theory doesn't really apply. - Well, it kills your immune system, and the way you hippie communists smoke it makes it 400 times more likely to lead to cancer than tobacco! - Well, anytime you consume a non-completely-combusted hydrocarbonate it's carcinogenic. But marijuana is medicine, or why else would doctors be prescribing it to people with cancer and AIDS? - Well, Mr. Smartass, why don't you just take all your fucking facts and figures to Amsterdam, hmm? - Okay, the first lady just said, "fuck." - Those godless faggots legalized pot. You know what happened to them? - Yeah, better call GLAAD and tell 'em she said "maggot," not "faggot." - Nothing but dope fiends and taxes through the roof! - Are you drunk? (audience cheers) - Listen, you little punk! I'm the goddamn leader of the free world, and when I drink, it's to relax and have fun! Not like you reefer addicts that are out smoking and getting high! I am the president's wife, and I am in charge here, and it's my way or the highway! You know, this is funny shit. Where are my laughs? - The first lady's been mixing Vicodin and scotch again. Ma'am! Give me all the goddamn tape! - Mrs. President! - Code bitch, code bitch! I want all the tape! I want all those tapes! - I know how to make people disappear! (secret service shouting) It's too early for bed! (audience cheers and applauds) I don't want to go to bed! - Ma'am, ma'am, put your legs together. - Just say "not" to pot! - They can see your panties, ma'am. (Mrs. President shouting) - "My, (laughs) god damn, buddy. That is some good weed you got there." He said, "yeah, Doug and Sue gave me an ounce of this. It's for my wedding gift, it's from Nepal, N-E-P-A-L." Nepal's a little country between India and China. It's where the Himalayan Mountains are, and in Nepal, marijuana's been legal for a little over 5,000 years of recorded history, and they're out there talking to god with this shit, all right, and my best friend's got an ounce of it. So we roll one skinny, little, toothpick-size number of that Nepalese weed. The first hit on the number, my wife hits the ground in her formal dress. (audience laughs) Here, here, give me that. (audience laughs) Give me that. I tell you, that's some good shit, isn't it? - [Interviewer] You have a cat? - Yeah, I have a cat. This is his litter box. Reefer! I'll inhale and shit, and he just stands there, and, like, it's obvious that he likes reefer. Where's, come here, I'll show Reefer. Come on, Reefer, meow meow, Reefer! You see Reefer? You know what, he probably smoked not that long ago, actually, you can tell by his eyes. Oh, that's my weed tits. - [Interviewer] Your weed tits? - Yeah, it's my weed tits. I keep my weed in here. - [Interviewer] Oh, that's brilliant. - It's a great stash place for my weed. Weed tits. The interesting thing, and what most people are unaware of, is that in the early 20th century, marijuana was fairly prevalent, much like alcohol. You could go to your local jazz scene and score pot. It was known as muggles back then. Not until the 1920s when Mayor La Guardia initiated the Marijuana Stamp Act did it become a problem. And what it required the citizens to do was to go into the government building with their marijuana, thus, entrapping them, because they hadn't had a stamp for the marijuana they brought in. (smoker coughing) Because after that, no one fucking could get a stamp.

Morphine just makes me sick! - Morphine? - Yeah! - Don't make it worse, lady! You have a right to remain silent, anything- - Why is this shit illegal again? - I told you already. - Just tell me again. - Because William Randolph Hearst and Pierre Du Pont had a lot of money invested in paper and petrochemicals, and they didn't like the competition from safer and cheaper hemp products, so Hearst spent the next 20 years demonizing cannabis in his newspapers in an effort to manipulate public policy against the plant, ultimately tricking the United States Congress into passing anti-marijuana legislation, despite the staunch protest of every major, major medical group in the country! - But why is this shit illegal? - I don't know if pot is a drug. A drug is when you take a plant and you ship it off to a pharmaceutical company in Germany from the same people that made Zyklon B death gas, and they bring you back a chalky, powdery, white pill that needs another pill to undo the damage of that your HMO can't afford.

But it's time for Doug and I to hit the road. - [Guests] No! - It's a party! Come on! - Because somewhere, someplace, there is a terminally ill medical patient in dire need of some comfort.

He should be. - It was a little bit too low budget for Snoop. - [Director] So how did the project, I mean how did it form, you being the writer and everything? - I was singing, pardon my voice, but, ♪ I'm a joker, I'm a smoker, I'm a midnight toker ♪ The Steve Miller song and my little son, Justin says, "Daddy, what's a toker?" And now we have a movie. Of course in the film, my son Justin is now a 15 year old hottie where they find a roach in her birth control pills. So we figured that would be much more sexy than a seven-year-old finding marijuana in his Thomas the Tank Engine. - [Director] So this movie had a lot of close calls and a lot of signs from God, kind of miracles coming together. - Every single thing that happened in this movie was amazing how it was just all kind of came into place in very strange ways. Like the character of Bertman, the lead character, the lead debater whose daughter is found with the roach, that was originally written for me. - And the director, Lee Abbott, was smart enough to say, well, you're really not this guy, you play the narrator. And at first I was going, he's throwing me out, he's just playing with me now. But then I really got into the Narrator character, I got to explore a different type. We assembled this cast that just ended up together, a lot of friends. Everybody does everything on this movie, all hats are worn. As a matter of fact, Kelly, has doubled as craft services, thank you for the pretzels, by the way. - No problem, No problem. I like to bring the pretzels, they eat a lot of those, you know, cheese and crackers. - [Waiter] Gentlemen, - Low budget and all we get is cheese and fucking crackers. In Hollywood we're literally referred to as the slam dunk. When you bring in Mark and Brian, it's a slam dunk, it's a win. It's a win-win for everybody involved. - Craig Shoemaker calls us up and said, dude, it's just, I don't know what I'm doing. You know, I wrote this thing and I thought it was funny and now I know it's a piece of shit. It's piece of shit, I need the old slam dunks. - [Interviewer] What kind of movie is "Totally Baked." - "Totally Baked," the original concept, which we're hoping ends up on the screen, is this body romp in finding the truth about marijuana and the truth about marijuana is it depends who you ask. - [Interviewer] Tell me about the first time you ever got stoned. - So we went to the carwash and my mother had this beautiful blue Malibu Classic, 1976 Chevrolet. We were both 14 or 15 and I was newly experienced driving and I don't think Chris had driven at all. At some point I said, hey man, back the car up, I need to vacuum it out and he got in the car and instead of hitting the brake he hit the accelerator while the door was open. And it was like a slow motion movie, the door just ripped right off on the pole. And there I was just standing there with his beautiful car, it was just destroyed. Which is probably not a good pot story, but it's, you know, maybe that's because the 14 year olds shouldn't necessarily smoke. But so anyway, I went home and my parents found everything. - I think a senior in high school at my house in the living room, mom was at work. And I think we had tried one, or I tried once before and I didn't get high. So we're smoking at this time and I'm looking at Chris and I'm going, man, I don't think this is working, I'm not high. I said, but you know, I'm gonna go get some eat. Chris said I was in the kitchen for about 20 minutes banging pots and dishes. And I finally come out and I'm holding three slices of bread. Chris goes, what do you got there, man? I said, you got a bread sandwich. (laughs) - We went over to this guy's house and he produced this, like something you'd seen a centerfold of High Times. And they had one of those gravity bong looking huge things and, I mean, they were taking a lot and I took one big hit. Had a few drinks and then next thing I know, I wake up and I think I've been buried alive because I'm in a room it's pitch black, I mean there is no light and I don't know where I am. I can feel I'm like on a couch but then I stand up and I like trip over all their shit and fall into like a shelf and all these boxes fall on me. Then I get up and I'm like, I'm on like a lawn mower. And I just start feeling around and eventually I feel this wall and I'm like, that feels like a garage door, I'm in somebody's garage. - We had an ordered a pizza like earlier in the day and then there's people over, it was kind of like we were having a little party. And then we noticed that there was ants attacking the pizza. So we got Raid and we sprayed it all over the pizza. Like literally drenched the pizza in Raid, I'm not kidding, it as disgusting, there was dead ants everywhere. The pizza was just covered in dead ants. So then about four o'clock in the morning, she wakes up and she's starving and she needs some food. And actually, we were still pretty much all awake at this time. So she's going through the kitchen and she's like, oh yeah, the pizza. Starts eating the pizza. She's on her second piece of pizza and she's eating the last bite of her second piece and our friend goes, where did get that pizza? And she's like, it's in the kitchen. But we were all like, no! And the poor girl was like throwing up, it was disgusting. She was crying, there was ants all over her tongue. It was nasty. So we had to call poison control and stuff but it was pretty fun. - I tried smoking marijuana and it gave me the shits. You remember that. - I do. - 'Cause he was trying to, it was back when we were in college and he smoked a lot. - You know, college. - And every time he did the first thing he wanted to do was just stick it in somebody's ass. And we being roommates and everything sometimes, you know, I'd be sleeping and I wake up like that, anyways. - Hey, what's that? - So I tried smoking at one time and I got the shits. - Yeah, you did. - Bad. - I remember that. - So I never really got into that very much. I mean, I had a couple of times, and it was just kind of, you know, I didn't inhale, please. But you know, I never got kind of beyond, well, let's go and have Haagen-Daz and pizza in that order. - The smell of pot reminds me of a good rock concert. - This is all make believe. I've never inhaled any marijuana, so I really haven't. I really have not. I have had a brownie or two in my life, but I was tricked. I didn't know. - I've had some dalliances with the demon weed. I wouldn't put a judgment on it for too long, but for certainly a chunk of time when I was out of high school, living in Manhattan, studying acting, waiting tables, living in a fifth floor walk up. Yeah, it was quite a help. - Oh yeah, you know, they had it, they gave it to me and I was just like, it finally hit me, I got stoned. So now I can say I got stoned, and I knew I was stoned because I laughed hysterically. - And I started laughing, and I laughed for about 20 minutes. (actors laughing) - Stop! Stop, you're killing me, you're killing me! (laughs) - I hope you like the movie, we had fun making it. (rock music) (bong water bubbling)
