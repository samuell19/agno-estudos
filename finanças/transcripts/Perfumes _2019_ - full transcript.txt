See, it was good fun. Yeah. It was! Wasn't it? Daddy, I'm hungry. You're hungry? There's a machine. You can get a Twix, they're good. Number 23, how much is it? 23? Two euros. I've got no change. - You got any? - No. Hang on. - No, don't... - Don't worry. - You'll see. - Stop it, Daddy. Very good, keep that up. What's he doing? Wait a minute. - What are you doing? - I'm sorry, but... I put my money in and nothing dropped. - What did you want? - She wanted a Twix. Thanks. - Great. - A Twix for Mademoiselle! Thank you. - Shall we go? - Yeah. - I put two coins in... - Bye. Come on. Stop messing around, kids! Thanks. - Can you find it, Maître? - Yes. Yes, yes. And... yes, yes, yes. Here you... are. It's a studio flat? Yes, but a big one. 24 square metres. 24 to 25. Why? Does that make a difference? You think you can bring up a 10-year-old girl in 20 square metres? 24. 24 to 25. Mr Favre, your daughter needs a room of her own. What if you have visitors? Or if you watch TV late at night? That happens. I know that I have trouble sleeping. - Do you understand? - What do you want? We're talking about my daughter, so I want to know what I have to do to have custody every other week. Do I have to promise not to watch TV too late? What do I... what? Do I have to move? PERFUMES All right, Kader? - All right? Pleased? - Yeah. Hi, guys. Hi, Marco. A coffee. All right? - Jean, you take Mr Decker. - Decker? OK. - Three days in Switzerland. - Yeah. Could be worse. Hey, Hugo. Watch your dandruff. - How's it going? - Good, and you? Arsène, where's my key? I can't find it. "Sir, you have committed "a driving offence, incurring two points on your licence." - What, me? - Want to see the photo? I don't understand, I've been really careful. Really careful? Only three points left. You know the rule. What? You're dropping me? No, Arsène, I need this job. Not for myself. It's for Léa. I have to move to secure custody. It's what the judge said. If I'm going to move, I need this job. Marcel! You're a pain, Guillaume. Mademoiselle Walberg. 11 o'clock, her place. Thank you. Got my key? Bye. Hello. Madame Walberg? - Mademoiselle. - Sorry. I'm Guillaume Favre, your chauffeur. - First floor, on the left. - You want me to...? Very well. Madame... Mademoiselle Walberg? Take the cases down. - Careful with the grey one. - Of course. Put the grey one on the back seat. - I've been very careful with it... - No, put it in the back. Where will you sit? I can't reach. Are your cigarettes lights? - Yes, why? - Winston. Yes, that's right. Do you want one? Virginian blond tobacco. I wouldn't know. What are you doing? With me, no smoking. Neither before nor during. Perfect. Let's go. Sorry, I... We can go if you wish. Come in. - Your cases. - Yes. Leave it open, for the draught. - And help me change the sheets. - Sorry? They use detergent full of galaxolide, for that "clean" smell. I hate it. I've brought towels and sheets. Yes, hello, this is Mademoiselle Walberg's room. Could you send up someone to change the sheets, please? - Is there a problem? - Don't bother, thank you. I can't stand the chambermaid's perfume. Mademoiselle Walberg, I'm a chauffeur. I carry luggage, I open doors... I even drive. But that's all. My job isn't to change your sheets. For reception, just dial zero. Guillaume Favre. Do you want your boss to know about your expenses fiddle? Pull more to that side. Tomorrow morning, 8 o'clock. Oh, no, a welcoming committee. Park here, park here. They'll want to come with us. Where? Into the cave. - Cave? - Yes. Cave? What cave? Who are they? The mayor, members of the council, the president of the tourism board... I can't work with that pack trailing behind me. What is your work? Go and talk to them. - Yes. - Talk to them? And tell them what? I don't know. You'll think of something. Go on, I'm sure you'll find the words. Go on! They said it's just after the rise. There are some steps. In the cave, take my notebook. - What? - Write down what I say. So I don't lose the thread. Mineral. Earthy, camphor, a bit of moss... Got that? Mineral, earthy, camphor, a bit of moss. Mineral... camphor... earthy... a bit of moss. Oak. Oak. You're right. Why does it smell of oak? Oak. Iris. - Iris root. - Iris root. There. Yes, very different. Can you explain what we've been doing? They've built a new cave nearer to the road, for tourists. Same dimensions, same paintings, completely identical. They want it to smell the same, too. So my job is to create a new perfume similar to what we've just smelled, which they can diffuse in the cave. People can do that? People? No. I can. I'm a nose. A nose. You know what that is? Yes, I know what it is. Here, I think they'd like you to give them back. Hello. - Shall I do it myself? - No. - Can I have some diesel, then? - Yep. Fill her up. - Want a pack? - No, thanks. I'm trying to quit. Want a drag? No. A quick one. Thank you. Thank you. Is there a sink? - You took your time. - Sorry. You've been smoking! No. No, I haven't. Didn't you see, it was her? - Stop it! - Then why are you shaking? I'm not shaking. But... that's enough! Have you finished? Can I have my hand back? Thank you. Every summer as a little girl, I went to a holiday camp, in a château by the Channel. This smell... There was a soap like that in the refectory. Copra oil. I loved it. After dinner, I'd wash my hands again, to keep the scent with me all night. Can I buy that? - What? - Your soap. This bar of soap here. Smell it. Don't you want a new one? Let go! Fucking let go! What were you thinking? You don't jump on people like that. - What? - What if he'd had a knife? Are you bollocking me? No, but... she's bollocking me! Here. There. There! But... you're not helping me with my cases? No, no, no... "Don't smoke." "Help me change the sheets." "Carry my bags." "Talk to them." How about a simple "thank you" or a "please"? Good night. Oh, it's you. I came in with a deliveryman. - Am I disturbing you? - Yes, I was blending my tea. Tea, that's a good idea. Can I have some? Draw the curtains, it's lovely out. Precisely. It's not good for your mood, staying in the dark all day long. Alone. How's your nose? Fine. Why wouldn't it be? I'm just asking. Taking care of you is part of my job. No, your job is to take 10% on the work you find me. I hate it when you talk to me like that. - I work hard to find great jobs... - Great jobs? A piped fragrance for a supermarket chain? I'm not doing that one. Tell me about the cave. Dark, cool, damp... A cave. They wanted you to stay for lunch. They agreed to pay in cash, you could have made an effort. What did you get, six thousand? No, five. Isn't that what was agreed? - No, I think it was six. - Well, if you don't know... - Cash is nice, but... - You want another hundred? - I didn't mean that, I... - Then what did you mean? Anyway... Shall we talk about Friday's job? You'll like it, it's with Birckel. - Excuse me. - Yes? - Isn't the 10-year-old size a bit small? - How old is she? - 10. - Get for a 14-year-old. Let me see. - It's too small. - No, it's not. Yes, everything's too small. I don't know. Stretch your arms out. - That's not too small. - Yes, it is, Daddy. Try the blue one. Léa. Léa, there's a big choice, you'll find something that fits. Look. This sweatshirt. You like unicorns, don't you? I wanted to buy you a present. Here we are. Léa, mind the seat. - Please. - The seat's fine. What shall we do next week? - There's Mummy. - It's time. It goes quickly, doesn't it? - See you, Daddy. - See you. Kiss-kiss! What is it? It's about Walberg. It's just that we had a bit of a... - She's refused three chauffeurs. - Really? I didn't know. - I haven't got any rice. - Shit. I haven't got any rice. - Rice. - Yeah. You were saying? - Walberg. - Yes. No, Walberg... She's not easy. It's up to the chauffeur to adapt, not vice versa. Do you agree? Last night... my mobile rang. Yes. - Walberg? - She has a job this week. And it has to be you. - Me? - Yes. - What? - She wants you to drive her. Yeah, she wants you to drive her. - I knew you'd get along. - We got along fine. - Great. - So what did you want to talk about? Nothing in particular. - I can finish eating, then. - Be my guest. No, but... I asked you to bring them down, not load them. Hello. Can you explain? Alsace is five hours by car, two by train. - He's taking us to the station. - What? Why send for me if you're going by train? Just to bring your cases down? Could we start again, on a better footing? We're off to a bad start. - Can you give him a hand? - Of course. Careful, it's fragile. Can I ask you something? Why did you tell Arsène that it absolutely had to be me? Why did you agree if you think I'm such a... pain in the arse? I don't have a choice. I have a ten-year-old daughter. If I want shared custody, I need this job. - What are we going to do, rent a car? - There's no need. No need? What do you mean, there's no need? - Madame Walberg? - Hello. Even better! - Can I help? - No, thanks. Leave it. That way. - It's that way, right? - Yes. Oh, yeah! Well? Yes, it's been badly tanned. A strong smell, very unpleasant. No, but... can you do something? Madame Walberg, is there or is there not some way to mask that smell? Masking it would be a mistake. I'd need to find what smell to combine it with, to rid it of that aggressiveness, to make it smoother, more reassuring, more endearing even. What you expect from a luxury handbag. It won't be easy. Well, as I explained, we have to deliver them to our shops next month. Four weeks. 1,200 bags. I don't know if you can imagine... Yes, a month... Not much time. So we need a solution within seven days. Seven days? Yes, I made a special point of that to your agent, it's... - Can we make the deliveries late? - No. No. And we can't deliver them like that. Can I have a word? Do you, er... Do you think you can find something in the seven days? Yes, I can, but my agent didn't tell me about that deadline. Why? OK, no problem for the seven days. But it will be double. What do you mean? Double. Double what was agreed. Fine. We agree to double it. - Very good. - Seven days. - What got into you? - The way they talked to you. - How did they talk to me? - Disrespectfully. - I didn't notice. - You had your nose in the handbags. They need you, you don't need them. I should've said triple. Shall I go back? Let's go. Come in. Your dinner. - Where shall I put it? - There, on the table. Here, smell this. It's better. But it smells of cloves, doesn't it? It's a bit strong. What does this make you think of? - I don't know. - Yes, you do. Close your eyes. Now breathe in slowly, as if you were smelling a flower. - Empty your mind. - No, I don't know... - Trust yourself. - It's not about trust... Trust yourself. Don't think, just breathe in. And now, what's the first image that comes to mind? Wood? Wood polished with wax... The wax-polished wood of old furniture in country homes. Or in churches. Pure honey essence. - I lose. - No, you were thinking of beeswax. Rinse your nose. What? Smell yourself, like this. We call it wiping the slate. Here. Go on. Well? - It reminds me of my rubbish bin. - Aldehyde C10. A characteristic note of Chanel N°5. Usually, it conjures up... orange peel. Yes, it made me think of the orange peel in my bin. You know, the... Your food will be cold. Good night. - Do you mind if I join you? - No, not at all, be my guest. It's OK, thanks. - A drop of wine? - No, thanks. Alcohol makes you tired. Tiredness is the worst thing for my job. Worse than smoking. Is there a problem? J'adore. Yeah, it does look good. No, the waitress. She's wearing J'adore, the perfume. Grasse jasmine, Indian sambac jasmine, Turkish damask rose, ylang-ylang, and a hint of slightly vanilla magnolia. You know the recipe of all perfumes off by heart? No, I don't. I know that one, though. I created it. Really? You created J'adore? Along with a few others, yes. Who hasn't dreamt of a princess's party? With Magic Birthdays, you can give your daughter the most magical party ever. It's my daughter's birthday in two days. I don't know what to buy her. What do you do when you're with her? That depends. We go shopping, to the pool... Stuff she likes doing. You take her where she wants to go. A bit like with me. You should take her to places you like. Places that you want her to discover. In 20 or 30 years, she'll remember that. Whereas a present... Something quite mellow. Kiss-kiss. Love you. - Mademoiselle. - In front? Yes, you can now. - Well? How's it feel to be 10? - It's funny. It was worth the wait, eh? Now I can move it forward, of course. And move it back, of course. I can also raise it, if necessary. - Got your swimming costume? - No. Did you tell me to bring it? You don't have it? - You didn't say. - What'll we do? - You didn't say. - Check that I brought mine. In that bag. - Here? - There. - Is this for me? - It's not my birthday. A nice package. - You like it? - Yes. It's lovely. Thanks, it's lovely. - It's really lovely. - Yeah, you like it? - Put your seatbelt on. - Where are we going? - Let's go. - Where, Daddy? - To try it out. - Where? Where are we going to try it out? You like surprises? That depends. I'm sorry. It doesn't matter. Are you coming? One... two... and three. Look how beautiful that is. Come a bit closer. - This is nice, eh? - Yeah. But don't tell your mother we came here, OK? She'd be furious. And if she told the judge... So what will you tell her? - I dunno. - You need to know. Why is there sand in your shoes? - Because I was on the beach. - No. You can't say that. Not the beach. Because I was... in the park. - Nice one. - The park. The sandpit. Nice one. Cool. Why is your hair all tangled? Because I went on the merry-go-round. Where did your dad take you for lunch? McDonald's. McDonald's? He's got a nerve! That's disgusting stuff. It's just McDonald's. - Cooey, Mummy. - All right? Yeah, good. - How was it? - Great! It was all right. Stop here. There. There, on the second floor. Can you see? The balcony where people are smoking. - You're not going to wait? - Yes, I am. Why? Yes. That's silly. Come in with me. No, that's nice, but I'm fine. One person more or less, no one will notice. No, I'm fine here. If I get bored, I'll go in that little bar over there and have a drink. Take your tie off. Why? What's wrong with my tie? Nothing. But if you take it off, you'll look less... Like a chauffeur? - Mademoiselle Walberg, are you sure...? - Not "Mademoiselle". Anne. Anne! I was just having a bet that you wouldn't come. Here. - It's a book. - Thank you. This is Guillaume Favre... Guillaume. This is Jeanne, my agent. Well, come on in. Pleased to meet you. Anne! There's someone who wants to talk to you. - No, don't look at him. - Really? No, I don't want to see him. Talk to me. What? What about? I don't know. Let's just have a conversation. Ask me how my day was, for example. How was your day? Fine, fine. And yours? - Good. - I got lots of things done. How are you? It's been ages! - How are you? - Fine. I have to introduce you to Diane. Have you met? Come on, I'll introduce you. I bet you'd turn up. Well? Well! Known each other long? A few weeks. It's recent, then? I'm really pleased for her. She can be a bit of a hermit. Living among her perfumes, never seeing anyone. She's made an effort tonight because it's my birthday. - And because of you. - No, I don't think it's that. I think she's just really happy to come to your birthday party. Come with me, I want to show you something. I like the position her hands are in. All right? That was her glory period. She'd just joined Dior. They were offering her fortunes to create perfumes. - Only at that time? - Yes. Why? What happ... There you are. We were looking at your portrait. Why show him that? You must be hungry, aren't you? Fancy a bite, darling? Are you coming? I'll get something to eat. See you later. I've known her for years. We've never been sincere with each other. But you, after five minutes, she takes your arm and gives you a guided tour. Back to your place, I suppose? Yeah, I don't know. Why, would you prefer a hotel? I'm joking. You see? Even when I try to joke, it... No one ever laughs. It's not funny. Why did you stop making perfumes? Here we are. Well, good night. Four years ago, I signed with a major American company. They wanted to put me in the limelight. They thought it'd boost sales. So they sent all these photographers, TV crews... I'm not keen on journalists. And all that bustle... I started losing my nose. Just a little at first, now and then. And then totally. What did you do? I made an appointment with a specialist. Professor Ballester. But I didn't go. I was afraid of what he might say. Afraid of it getting out, too. So I acted as though everything was fine. I thought that with my experience, I could do my blending... without my nose. From memory. And it worked. Once, twice. But the third time, I got it completely wrong. And they tore up the contract. I was fired. I went away to get some rest, far from Paris, for three months. And one day, it came back. Just like that. Just like before. But the damage had been done. The perfume world is a small one. Jealousy... In a case like that... no one phones you, no one answers your calls. Good night. Yes, good night. She can remember thousands of smells. The slice of lemon on your plate? She can tell you where it's from. Whether it's from Sicily, Mexico or California. Just by the smell. So... what exactly is her job? That's it. She smells stuff. That's all? - It's not bad. - Yeah. "I the undersigned, Arsène Pélissier, "director of the company Elite Driver, "certify that Mr Guillaume Favre has been working for me as a chauffeur "on a continuous basis since September 6th, 2006. "Fully satisfied with his work, "I hope we will continue this collaboration on a regular basis." Leather seats, of course. They're clever. Mr Favre? - Mr Bourigault, the estate agent. - Hello. It's my father's company. I'd rather make that clear, as he's still alive. - They're clever, eh? - Who? The engineers and designers of these cars. - Shall we? - Yes, of course. Is it this one? We're in luck. There you go. Yeah, it's nice. The kitchen is over here. Oh, here it is. Of course... - That's good. - There's a bit of furniture. - What's this? - A cupboard. - Oh, no. - I like that. Yes, it has charm. Mouldings too. Excuse me, do you think you could...? So I can have... Come and see! - Beautiful, isn't it? - Yes. Even from above, it's got style. I don't have a permanent contract, but a certificate from my employer. - It's practically the same. - "Practically"? Well, as I said, my dad's the boss, so... Shall I see you out? Would you like to have a go? If you could influence your father a bit on my behalf... I could let you have a go. On the motorway? Yeah, on the motorway. See you soon. If you'd like to come with me. Oh, the code! About this factory... It's the company's biggest production site. It's open all the time, 24/7. But the chimney produces smoke, and the smoke smells. A local pressure group wants it closed. If you can come up with a solution, we can demand a huge pay-out. Can you say something? Great? I'm killing myself hunting for gold and you turn up your nose. Say yes, say shit, but say something! What if I made perfume again? What? If I went back to making perfume, would you help me? Look, I'm suggesting what's best for you. This factory may not be glamorous, but it's the jackpot. After that, you can take a break... I don't want a break, I want to make perfume! Perfume, fragrance, eau de toilette... Perfume! It's too soon. Too early how? It's been four years. Four years that I've been perfuming shops, cat litters and car seats... Four years! When I mention your name, know what I get? Anne, do this factory. Give me the time, I'll find you something good, I promise. I promise I'll try, anyway. Reminds me of my dad. The mower. I say that because... when I was a kid, we lived on this little hill, and on Saturdays my dad mowed the lawn, like all the neighbours. You heard the lawnmowers' engines on every side. And... it's mostly the smell. That smell of mown grass. I used to love that. That's what reminds me of my dad. Not the mower itself. When you mow the grass, it's open to attack by insects, which will devour it. So, to defend itself, each blade gives off an enzyme, which attracts other insects, which come and eat or scare off the first insects. The smell of cut grass is that of enzymes. It's the smell of carnage. Yes, come in. Your cases. The room with the big window. The photo with the man in it? That's the estate agent. Well, his son. It's facing due west, it's a really beautiful room. - Don't you think? - Daddy, I have to go. Mummy's calling. Kiss-kiss, Daddy. Sorry. Talking to my daughter. I may have found a flat. I thought she'd be pleased, but she doesn't sound keen. Good evening. - Are you ready? - I'll take the veal liver. No. The magret... No, that's boring. No, the Caesar salad. Monsieur? Sorry. I'll have the veal liver. A glass of white wine. And we'll also have a bottle of still water. Very well. Thank you. Eau Bleue. The waitress is wearing Eau Bleue. A dash of cheap citrus, a peppery hint... quite mediocre. The perfect example of a perfume without interest. My wife used to wear it. Sorry. - Brunette or blonde? - Who? The waitress. Brunette or blonde? I don't know. Why do you ask? She came, you decided, you ordered, she noted it down. But you sat there with your nose stuck in the menu. You didn't once raise your head to look at her. People don't just have a smell. You know that, right? She's coming back. I bet you can't even say a couple of things to her. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Two things. Hi, what can I get you? Hi. - The same as them. - A mojito? Coming up. Mademoiselle Walberg? Mademoiselle Walberg? Excuse me, can you open this door? I think there's a problem. Thank you. Mademoiselle Walberg. Shit! Mademoiselle Walberg? Anne. - Are you OK? - What are you doing here? I was knocking at the door and got no response. Can you stop that alarm? What's wrong? - What time is it? - Half past eight. We should be in the car by now. Your stuff isn't ready. We have to strip the bed, too. Leave it, I'll do it. - Are you sure? - Yes. - I'll get changed. - Hurry, we're already late. Wait. - On the table there's... - What? A notebook with the factory guy's number. - Call him. - Notebook. His number's in there, call him and tell him we'll be late. - You're sure you don't want my help? - No, go on. Hang on. Could you bring me up a coffee, please? - Of course. - Thank you very much. - What can you smell? - What do you mean? - What does it smell of? - It stinks. I got that, but what does it stink of? I'm a bit hazy this morning. I don't know, maybe I'm tired. I need you. - What does it smell of? - You can't...? - It smells of... - Go ahead. It smells of... rotten eggs. Sewers. More rotten eggs or more sewers? Rotten eggs. Hydrogen sulphide, yes. What else? What else? Glue. Yes. - Wallpaper paste, you know? - Oh, yes. Benzaldehyde. Benzaldehyde. - It won't be easy. - Why? Because we're in the open air. We're outside. If I made the air smell of marshmallow, people would still complain. The air shouldn't smell of marshmallow. What will you do, then? I'll tell them. I'll tell them. What are you doing? I can't smell anything. You're not opening them all? I can't smell anything! I could still vaguely smell something this morning, but now... I can't smell a thing. It's happened again. Again! Maybe it's just fatigue, or last night's booze. Can I have some water, please? Here. What's that? Nothing, just to help me sleep. Yes, just a second. What's your problem? Dickhead! Sorry. Mademoiselle Walberg? Mademoiselle Walberg, can you hear me? Mademoiselle Walberg, can you hear me? Hello. We're connecting you to the emergency services. This call will be recorded. Do you know her medical history? I don't know a thing. You're asking me these questions, but... - How old is she? - I don't know. Who are you to her? Her chauffeur. - Can you repeat that? - I'm her chauffeur! - OK. I'll tell you where to take her. - Good. Hurry up. Thanks. Shit! It's OK. She's fine. The emergency services told me to step on it, so I stepped on it. I'm not taking this lying down. I'll explain. 180 km/h, explain what? There must be someone I can explain it to. I was saving someone's life. And the nine others? The nine other what? The nine points when you weren't saving a life? Hello. I had the feeling that one day I'd get some news about you. Back then, I read lots of articles about you. For someone like me, the idea of treating someone like you... obviously... Who are you? What am I doing here? An overdose of Maverick 1000. It seems... that you wanted to sleep. Well, you certainly did that. Anosmia. Partial or total loss of the sense of smell. You know that. It's happened to you before. You called me back then. And I'd been waiting for you, until yesterday. I'm Professor Ballester. Your chauffeur called me at my practice. He told me you were here. This time I came... to make sure I didn't miss you. Untreated or badly treated, anosmia always returns. The nose and the brain decide to stop working together. In some cases we can ascertain the cause of their disagreement, and try to make them patch things up. But when we don't know, we show them that... they have plenty of things they can achieve together. A bit like... you and me. If you agree. Good. There, you see! Almost. The teacher asked, for the end of term, for parents to tell us about their jobs. Could you come? Your mother'd be better. She came last year. She said it'd be good if you came. - Really? - Yes. - She really said that? - Mm-hmm. Will you come, then? I have to think about it. I've been thinking, too. Really? About what? About when you get that flat. I want to stay every other week with you. A few of my friends do it and they say it's great. So I thought... Aren't you pleased? Yes, I'm pleased. Are you sure? Daddy? You're not pleased. I am, sweetie. It's just that... The flat... I'm not getting it anytime soon. That's why. Why? Because the landlord... isn't renting it now. Well... not yet. Not right away. It doesn't matter. There are loads of other flats, you'll find one. It doesn't matter if it takes a bit more time. That's life. Come here. Come here, my daughter. My beloved daughter! It's so ugly here. Everyone is really nice. Maybe, but it's ugly. And Ballester? He's good. Really good. He's really nice, too. What does he say? That I should avoid thinking about it, not turn it into an obsession. I'm getting out in three days. I have to get lots of rest at home and wait for it to come back. Wait for it to come back? What a great diagnosis! Jeanne. My sense of smell will return. And I'll make perfume again. Yes, I'll make perfume again. And I'll manage without you. What's got into you? - Is it your treatment? - No. I need calm and serenity. I need to think about other things. Because the only thing that you're interested in is when I'll get my sense of smell back so you can get me working again! Guillaume, it's Arsène. I'm calling because I may have something for you. It's an old mate of mine. He's bust his leg, so he needs someone to replace him. You don't need a driving licence. - Hello. - Hi. - Hi. - So... - you're a mate of Arsène, is that right? - Yes. - Me too. I'm Ranio. - Guillaume. Let me show you. Come on. I don't know if Arsène told you. It's a machine from the '70s. But don't worry, it's really easy to use. OK. Come on. And the engine's in really good condition. Here's the beast! Kubota. Look into the distance. Pick a spot. You understand? That's it. Not directly in front. Far, far! That's it. Good. Stare at a point over there. That's it. Further, further! Keep it good and straight! That's good! This? Sniff it for ten minutes. Twice a day. Twice.... a day. Ten minutes. Oh, yes. I want you to pick a familiar smell, and then try to smell it, two or three times a day. Always the same smell, and only one. Don't disturb everything by trying to smell a thousand things. That's pointless. Of course. Just one. Anything? Anything. Anything, but... it's better to choose a smell you like. - That's nicer. - It's better. You can establish a marking system. From zero to five, for example. Zero is nothing at all, one is a little bit, two is more. Three is more again. - So five is perfect. - Exactly. Exactly. Five is perfect. Zero to five. Good. Good. We'll stay in contact. Here's my... That's my mobile number. We'll talk on the phone. Every day. - Every day? - Yes. Yes, it's important. Is that your chauffeur, waiting for you? No, I couldn't get hold of him. Really? I ordered a taxi. A taxi. A taxi is practical. Yes, it's practical. Monsieur? You were out cold, so he called the emergency services. They told him to hurry. So he hurried. Well? Your nose? It's better. Well... a bit better. Patrick thinks... it should be back to normal pretty soon. Patrick? Professor Ballester. Thanks for calling him. Patrick. I'm training myself with this. It's the only scent that I'm allowed to smell. I'm going to make perfume again. Really? Would you help me? Me? How could I help you? - No licence. - That doesn't matter. There are a thousand things to do. Find essential oil suppliers, keep track of purchases, keep an eye on the weather... That's important because... if there's a hurricane in Madagascar, the price of vanilla skyrockets. Why not ask someone already in the business? It'd be better for you. Because... Because you have a gift, Guillaume. You don't trust yourself, but you do. A gift? I'm so gifted that all I'm good for is driving a lawnmower! A gift! What do you like about this job? Being told what to do every day? Yes, the smell of freshly mown grass. Is that it? While we're on the subject of mown grass... The houses next to the stinking factory. Do you know what they all have in common? - No, what? - A lawn. So, in the summer, when the wind blows the factory's bad smells towards the houses... the mown grass, the enzymes you told me about... the locals are enveloped in them. So if you... found something that would combine with hydrogen sulphide so that it smelled like mown grass, I was thinking that... maybe that could be a solution. I don't know. Cis-3-Hexen-1-ol. Liffarome too, of course. Triplal. Triplal? Triplal is another green, grassy smell, but fuller, if you see what I mean. Yes, more like a beautiful meadow. Like Switzerland, the Tyrol... That's it. Yes, that's it. Who's that fellow there? That's Ranio. Ranio, this is Madame Walberg. Mademoiselle. No, don't put yourself out. You've gone past it. You've gone past it. No, there. No. No, no. Yes, it is, I'm sure of it. Oh, yes! No, it's because I thought that... - My new employment contract. - OK. And the tenancy agreement. The tenancy agreement. With my new address here, which is close to my daughter's school. First give them the three citrus fragrances to smell. Then the floral bouquets, and end with the woody one. They won't be interested. They will. They'll like them, I assure you. I can smell it! I'm feeling my way. Do I keep it on? - What? - My tie. I'll take it off. I'll look less... Come on. Please yourself, I'm going. It's not you they're interested in, it's your perfumes. We start with the woody one, then the floral, and we end with the citrus ones. On your table we've placed two small blotters. Two each. And two small bottles. One on the right, in which there's cinnamon. What is cinnamon used for? - Baking cakes? - Yes. And in the other bottle, you can smell lemon. So, dunk your blotters. Then twirl them like this. - It smells like...? - Coke! Yes, the smell of Coke. That's what a "nose" does. A nose is someone who combines different smells to create a perfume, a pleasant smell, also called a fragrance. That's the job. PERFUMES
