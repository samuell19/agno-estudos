I don't put them on anymore. Except in class. I can't see anything but that's okay. I do exercise on my eyes. What else? Your father works abroad. In denmark, i think. No, sweden. You quit school for a year to be with him. You know all that? Fuck, you knock me out! Why are you always on your own? Think you are too good for us? No, i just prefer being alone. How about a coffee? No, i have to go. Too bad for you... chanvert, history teacher, fishy. Follow her. Your hands are so soft. It feels as good as ever. You have a real knack for it. No need to woryy about my future then. After your dad died, i started playing the lottery. I blew a crazy amount of money. I was convinced i'd win and that we'd leave france. I wanted us to move to canada. I don't know why. I was sure it was the ideal place to start a new life. Stupid, isn't it? Carry on, you're doing me good. Maybe you'd have been happier there. But i am happy. If you showed us that more often. I'd worry a lot less. Your mother's so beautiful... i love watching her. Don't you trust me? What are you doing, marie? You have to kiss me. How much did they bet? 100 francs? Is that all? It has to last longer than that or they won't buy it. Come on. She's fooling us. Forget her. Fuck, karim. No... fuck... karim benani fucks his history teacher. Come and dance! We won't eat you! Kids today don't know what fun is. I bet that's carole. Can you go? Okay, little brother? Very good. Someone's having a good time. A really wild party. I've brought a friend. Eric? Simon... sweetheart, where have you been? This is simon, a friend. Happy birthday, mum. You shouldn't have... come on in... hello cut, rene. Want to play? We have to be going soon... you only just got here! I have to work tomorrow. They just called me. You work sundays now? Stay a while. I never see you. Do you want one? No thanks. To helen i read your latest article. You write good stuff. Rene showed it round at work. Mom... i'm proud of you, that's all. My darling daughter... you're not very objective. I'll go and see eric. If he lets you in. That's not a bedroom, it's fort knok. Okay? Is that dad's sweater? Boring evening? The corsons are a nightmare. So what's new? Tell me... tell you what? I don't know. I never see you, you never call me... how's mom keeping? She's okay. Kind of weird lately. I don't know why. And the betting ace? He hasn't placed a bet for six months. He's making an effort, mom says. So she says... the trouble with journalists is they don't know real life. They look down on everything. Everything's either black or white with them. Your sister... i have to admit she writes well. I'm proud of her, even if she isn't my daughter. But sometimes she goes too far. She can be too narrow-minded in her approach. What do you think? About all that... take an interest in politics. You vote in six months. I can't vote but i'd like to. You have to know what's going on to vote correctly. Is what i'm saying that boring? I'm listening to you, okay. Excuse me... want anything else? No thanks. Another beer, please. I thought you'd enjoy coming here... having dinner in a china place... i can't stand this stuff. We came here for you. I've invited you out, in case you hadn't noticed! I'm trying to make you happy. D' you realise that? I'm not hungry anymore. I'm going. Thanks. I'm sorry. Where are you going like that? What are you up to in the dark? You're not working? No. You mom wanted you to see something funny on tv... no thanks. I was just going to bed. You were? Good night. Stop pissing me off. Your kid's as pleasant as ever. Is he working? I don't know... leave him alone. He's getting on my nerves. A new girl... don't keep mention that! The small one's for the mail... this one's for the door... have a good holiday. Okay? Did you sleep well? What time is it? Half past five. I'm wiped out. Why didn't you say simon had a son? You don't kill your mother off on her birthday. Are you in love this time? I'm glad you came. We haven't had a good talk in ages. Mom's very worried about you. She is? That's news to me. Did she tell you that? She says that she can't communicate with you since dad died. Right, you don't talk much. Mom just wants me to seem normal. To never mope... to smile at that other asshole... that way, we'll be communicating. Shit! Maybe she thinks i communicated before... when a kid watches his dad die and his mom freak out, can he talk? What a load of crap. Where were you all that time? Dad and i, well... it was kind of difficult... how are things at school? Got and friends? Any girlfriends? No... well, yes. I don't know. I don't like talking about it. Want to give eric a cuddle? What's up? A family plot? Want to see the kites? We're going to see the kites. Did you get to talk? Sort of... i'm going about it all wrong. In any case, i like the way he's adopted loic. Give mom my love. Goodnight goodnight i'm completely lost. D' you know where building 3 is? Just over there. Thanks. Something wrong? I had a terrible night. Because of the party? What party? Just opposite. They mad a real din. I didn't hear anything. You and rene fought? You'd like that wouldn't you? No, i just had a bad night. Got you gym class tonight? Why all these questions? Shouldn't we communicate? Sorry, this is a bad time. Did carole tell you simon has a son? What do you mean? Didn't you know he was divorced? He took that job as a runner for his kid's sake. He needs the money. Why didn't she tell me? You didn't answer. Have you got you class tonight? Bravo! You just hit the jackpot! Welcome to your happy home! I'm all yours... what a smile! What a figure! What a party spirit! Can you turn that down, please? I asked you to turn it down! I can't stand crap like this. Can you tell me what it's about? I bet you don't understand it. There's nothing to understand. It's a really good film. "A really good film"! If you've nothing better to do... where the fuck is she? I bust my ass while she's with those cows in pink tights. It's worse than a sect. It's only a gym class. I told you to turn it down. D' you think i'm stupid or what? I do what i want in my own home. I'm sick of your arrogance. Shut up and clear the table! You were waiting for me? Sit down. Where were you? And you? I asked you a question. I missed the last metro. You let me know, okay! You leave a note or you call me. He didn't tell you? "He"? Rene! I don't believe it! Can't you make an effort? It's getting unbearable! You're both too stubborn for words. As a kid, i wanted to be a soccer player. I was the best on the team but i was a girl. Dumb, huh? Did you ever want to be a champ or anything? No, not really... why did you bring me here? Don't you like it? I do. I come here sometimes. I know. I've followed you. You've followed me? Why do you come here every day? Give me your right hand. What are you playing at? You know all about me but i don't know you. Fuck, i'm lost. Give me the other one. 3, lmpasse de la colonie, last night, after midnight... virile company... trouble for the pretty couple or extra excitement... a bit of both? Can't wait to see more... hey hello? Tom, stop it. Stop. Hi, mom. What are you doing here, sweetheart? Got time for coffee? Not this evening, i'll be late. Let me get my things. What's the matter? You look odd. No, it's because... i don't know but... you seem kind of sad lately. Sad... i'm not sad. I'm tired. I wasn't in great shape the other night. You get that way too occasionally, don't you? I have to go but we'll talk about this again. Oh, no... don't you want to kiss me? I bet 200 this time. Very funny. I'm waiting. You bit me! You asshole! You stupid asshole! You think it's funny? You bit me! Why did you bite me? To my new friends he's been squatting here for a week. He can't make a full sentence. Marek's not talkative but who cares about that... i don't get much of the rest. See you downstairs. Tom! Tom! What are you playing at? Another one. I know. "Two men for one pretty neighbour." "You seemed so happy." What happened after? "I don't dare imagine. Call me next time." Fucking jerk! He's pissing me off. I'm sick of this crap! I do what the hell i like! Come on, tom! We'll be late! Okay, let's go. You little thief! Why were they in your room? I looked everywhere for them. What the hell do you use them for? Why do you need binoculars? Answer me. Look at me. I'm not kidding now! You searched my room? I do what i like here. Paying the rent gives me every right. I sleep with you mom. Learn to accept that and stop pissing me off! Shut the fuck up! You piss me off! You piss us all off! Ask mom what she thinks! Take a look at this! She freaked me out on the phone. She talked about rene but she made no sense. Do you now what happened? No, i already told you. You promise? Sit down. Don't stand there like a moron. C'mon... i mean, nobody's died. Families are a bloody nightmare. As soon as my dad has a problem, he clams up like that. My mom's the opposite. She has these fits of hysterics... it'll all blow over. You're hiding something. You wouldn't have turned up her otherwise. It's not like you. Talk to me, for god's sake. Talk to me! Piss off! Hey, calm down, both of you! Yelling at each other won't help. If you have something to settle... forget it. He gets on my nerves. Don't worry, i'll talk to her. She's right, you're stubborn... you're stubborn, all right. Honey? Where are you? Come here, honey. Come on, babe. What are you doing? I wanna play with you. Get lost. I wanna play with you. Shut up. I wanna play with you. Shut your mouth! What happened? He's mean, he pushed me. Who? Eric? Yes. He hurt you? Yes. Where? Here. You're okay. Off you go to bed now. You need help, pal. There's no need to take in out on loic. Everyone's gonna calm down cause this is starting to wind me up... carole, come out here now. Carole. Sorry, but i don't want to go back. You've no idea how tough it gets. I believe you that living with rene isn't a barrel of laughs. I'll believe you that it's even harder at 17 but you go too far. Mom would be lost without him. How do you know? What was that? Nothing nothing? What a surprise... god, you're so annoying! If you can't talk to us or trust us, get out of here. I won't stop you. I know it! You don't want any trouble in your shitty life! You're an egoist! Deep down, you're an egoist! Why the hell are you so mad at me? Because i dared to say once that dad wasn't that great? You need to loosen up, pal. You're pretty aggressive. I mean, she's your sister. Yeah, and i'll do what i like! She never listens. She couldn't care less about us. She just wants to get laid by guys like you. Okay, that does it. Come back hen you grow up a bit! Let go, asshole! You're the egoist, not me! It won't change till you do! Sure! And thanks for a great evening! Egoist... egoist yourself. Fuck... talk about a wild night! You've got no party spirit, that's what i say. C'mon, fabienne, you can't even stand. No, seriously, you're all too depressing. D' you keep your glasses on in the shower? We aren't ready to order yet. And that one there... you don't' understand a word and just smile like an idiot. I very well understand french. That not nice for me. No, not nice. What'll you have? D' you care! How about you? Espresso. Right? Good. And you? A beer for the road. Any croissants? With the beer? Yeah, sure. When you're gone... i want a ricard. No, you'll puke again. You're not sleeping at my place so if i do, it's my problem. You're drunk. We'll talk about that later. Shit, you're not my dad, you're not my brother. Not even my guy! Get off my back! I'm not ordering you a ricard. I don't need you. A ricard, please. And two croissants. Those fags get on my fucking nerves. You're not a fag, are you? No, you don't look it. Got a cigarette? Tom, toss me my ciggies, please. Want one? Thanks. Excuse me. She's had a drop too much. Don't i know you? I doubt it. What's your name? Eric i'm tom. Pleased to meet you. I won't shake your hand... have a good day. Yeah, right... have a good day. Eric what happened with rene? When i got home, he was here all alone in the dark. He didn't say a word to me i thought he was going to cry. Your sister called. He left just then and i haven't heard from him since. What happened exactly? I'd never seen him in such a state. He scared the hell cut of me. Don't' cry, mom. Don't' worry, he'll be back. I'm setting a bad example. If i'd gone to school, i'd have fallen asleep in class. That's good. Yes, but not today. What if i meet my boss? I don't dare think about it. He's filling in for you. He's filling in for me. He's filling in... stop it, everyone's looking. Thanks, bye. I forgot to buy some cream. At karim's brother's? In a warehouse? Where? Okay, i know it. I'll be early. I promise. Okay, see you. What? I can't talk right now. Me too. See you. Each time it rings, i pray it'll be rene. Why do you stay with him? Who was that who called? A girl from school, you don't know her your girlfriend? If a girl calls, she has to be my girlfriend? No, it's just the tone of your voice... stop moving, i'll make a mess of it. I've been invited to a party. That's wonderful. Are you going? I don't know. Go! You're so like your father. Either you never leave your room or you're out every night. I know it's not easy for you with rene. But i need him. And we're the only family he's got. I'm sure he'll never abandon me. Is that rene? Rene has the keys. I knew i'd seen you before. Small world, isn't it? Having your hair cut? What do you want? Me? I don't' want anything... see you round? See you round. Any time... hello. I must have got the wrong floor... bye. Who was that? I don't know. Wow, he's cut his hair! Marie's wild tonight. Karim, give me a move. About time too! I thought you weren't coming. If you don't want to talk, i'm dancing. He's not even 16! So? He's cute, isn't he? You're like that bitch chanvert? Shithead! Karim! You hear that? What'd you say? Got a problem. Forget it, karim. He's an asshole. Get yourself laid, it'd help. Stop it! Cut it out, karim! Get out of here! Come on. Let go of me! Come on. Let go of me! Hold on! I want to talk to you. First, i don't know why you provoked karim. He invited you because i asked him to. Second, i'm realising what a dumb shit you are. You don't know how cruel you can be. You're selfish. You don't give a dawn about... what goes on around you. That's what i liked at first... the idea that the world couldn't touch you. I thought that if we were together, i'd feel protected too. It's too complicated. You make me feel ugly. You don't see me, you don't look at mee... well, not really. Not enough. It's as if i wasn't there. If a guy feels me up, then you look at me. And that's only because it wounds your pride. We'll stop seeing each other. It's too hard for me. I'm sorry. I understand. See, you're still doing it. You can't understand. I don't know why but i love you. So i'm going. No fever, but his blood pressure's a bit low. Yes, we have a doctor but he doesn't see him often. What's wrong with him? He spent two nights at a hotel and blew 3,000 francs at the races. Hadn't he given up betting? He's not very well, you know. He's a bit depressed. Nothing serious. His nerves are a bit fragile. I've given him some anti-depressants. He'll have to rest for a few days. No drinking or smoking. Call your usual doctor if there's no change. Is that all? If there's anything else, your have to tell me. Problems at work, or elsewhere... no. What's wrong? No more news? Not even a note? Lost your pen? I know you're living. You're not with me. What do you mean? I know you're leaving me. Don't try to deny it. Don't be stupid... that's right, treat me like a jerk! What's your fucking son told you? That i'm an asshole? Leave eric out of this! It's all so ugly. Of course it's ugly. So? What difference does it make? Living this life, you end up ugly too. You have to forgive me, helene... why? I should have fought harder to take you away. Or at least to go on that trip you've always dreamed of. I couldn't even manage that. How did i make such a mess of things? Don't say that. It'll be all right. What are your doing there? Spying on us? I just wanted to apologise. What for? Apologise? I'd like to apologise too... but i can't figure out what for. Even now, i don't believe in your apologies. Don't start again... start what again? It is my fault his father's dead? Don't talk about him! That's enough... you see... some days, to get a little peace, i used to think i should've died. Instead of your dad. But that wouldn't change anything. You'd still be as selfish. I know, i'll give you a gift to make up. Rene, please... rene, stop it. You don't want us to be friends? Here, they're for yo. Take them! Take them! Take them! Take them! Take them! Oh shit! They fell. That's a bugger... too bad. No gift, no friends. Asshole... tell him to get out. Eric, please... okay, i get the message! Tom, we need to start packing! Yes? What is it? No, i get the wrong door. Hey! No, this is the right place. Come on in. Come on. Who is he? Don't you remember? Come on, sit down. Make yourself comfortable. Want something to drink? You've started... i'll have tequila. Fabienne? He's a friend? Let's say we're acquainted. Pretty well acquainted. Right, eric? Eric grandier. You know him too. No, i don't think so. You sat with me in that bar. Maybe... i don't know. You met him there? No, not really. Did you get my note? I'm glad you came over, eric. It's crazy how curious i am about you. Can someone tell me what's going on here? Eric is a neighbour. A very attentive one. I wrote you those letters. Letters? What letters? It was you? You know and you didn't tell me? So what? You're a jerk. And i want you out. I'll always be with you. What? You're really pretty. Really very pretty... even when you were drunk, i'd rarely seen such a pretty girl. I don't get any of this. Are you two having me on? You send revolting letters to pretty girls? The letters, that's different. They're not that revolting. I need a drink. Tell me, eric... the other morning... did we meet in that bar by chance? Pure chance. Shit... i liked the idea of a troubled teenager following me all night. You think i'm a troubled teenager? No, that's my fantasy. Don't confuse things. You're leaving? Because of me? What's that to you? It would be a shame if i chased you away. Isn't that cute? He's worried about us. Anonymous letters would put anyone on edge. Not everyone gets them. Is it? My brother got them too. That was different. That was out of boredom. So what was it with us? You... everything you did seemed to be so i could see. Like you were enjoying it. Oh, come on... that's enough. This has gone on far too long. Take your bottle, finish it and go home. Your parents will be delighted to see their little voyeur. My dad died five years ago. My mum's just thrown me out. No one's expecting me tonight. Can you understand that? No one! I like it here. I just want to spend some time with you. Is it too much to ask? Bravo. Great idea, bringing him here. You're like the others. Shit scared if something happens. Tough shit that something is me and i don't want to leave. I'll get the bottle, i think we all need it. It's hot here, isn't it? I'm stifling. You didn't answer. Are you leaving because of me? This is my brother's apartment. You now, the "pretty biker". He'll be back in two days. If i hadn't come tonight, i'd never have found you. You know where to find tom. What about me? Have you followed me too? I see... is this any time for that? You bet. Here, eric... have some. I've had too much to drink. Are you okay? Are you out of your mind? This guy's sick! What's so funny? Oh, come on... he's just told you what he wants. I'm not your type? I don't believe this! You're totally nuts! You're both good-looking. Give her a little time. I've already thought it over. Is it your first time? Too bad! Just a second... look at me. You can't come in. I live here. No one can come in. He's mrs grandier's son. You're mrs grandier's son? Follow me, please. This is her son... hello. Please come with me. What's going on? We'll explain upstairs. Your mother's here. Mom? Mom? Come with me, please. I'll look after her. Touch nothing. Where's the medical examiner? He should've been here then minutes ago. He's always late. What are you doing in the dark? I was waiting for you. I've made dinner. I'll be looking at apartments next week. I'd like you to come with me. Will you? If you want... want some? No. Do you miss him? What? Rene. Do you miss him? Of course i miss him. I miss him too. Nice here, isn't it? Marie! Catch! Shake yourself. Enjoy it! Marie's really cute... it's a shame mom didn't come with us. She's learning to live without us. That's good. How is she? Better. Mom... she seems fragile... but her kind survives what ever happens. What about you? Me... l'm her son. Hurry up! Too far! I like being with you. You don't seem to be here. Is something wrong? Is something wrong? It's nothing. It'll pass. Are you crying? Eric? Are you crying?
