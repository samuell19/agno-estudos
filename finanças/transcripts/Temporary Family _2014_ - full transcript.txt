Look! The planet Earth is huge! Where do you want to live? Dolphins live in the ocean. Deep sea organisms, of course live in the deep sea. Teddy bears live in the forest. Birds are the freest, can fly everywhere. What about human beings? Human beings are doomed! On planet Earth, only human beings need to pay home mortgage. Look how distressful we are! Beyond compare with the birds and teddy bears. Hey, wanna see some show flats? For your own use or for investment? For speculation! Rent for a while, resell if price rises sufficiently. How's the price in this area? Rise fast? Fast as lightning. Salesmen love to bluff. Property agents are all assholes! Ideal to rent it to a small family. They have lots of knick-knacks. I do it. They would love all these cabinets. Family? No way! Must of course rent to elite singles! A 3-bedroom unit? What bullshit! I have 4 apartments on hand. You haven't got your license when I start speculating. Elite singles like expats, top executives and B-list starlets. Families are troublesome. Couple quarrels at midnight, neighbors complain. Son got sick, no money to pay rent. Families are burdensome, no way! There is more... Remove this wall! Adjoin the two rooms. Name this space as..."Classy corner" If you bought it, I will find tenants for you. Elite singles, monthly rent at 30K, I promise. Family? No way! Purely my personal opinion. Yeah, family, no way! Freedom is the most important. Money is essential, wife and children are knick-knacks. This way please! Wanna try luxury flats for a change? The rise is faster! Call me if you got super value units, asshole! Try my best! Only asshole clients are served by asshole agents! What? Nothing...try my best! Your divorce paper is ready. Where is it? You've lost it? Not possible. Here it is! He signed already? Yep. When? This morning. What time? 9:00 am. As soon as he got up? Not sure about that. Before he left, he said he still loves me. Been together too long, taking a break is normal. He needs me. Done! That's it? Yes. You may... Sit a while if you want. No need to squeeze your way in! What's the hurry? I hate couriers! Dad, I am a courier. How about this one? Got a date with someone nearby. Hak, here! Seats here! Waitress! Is this a striptease parlour? Yuck! The seat is sticky. Set D Not easy to do business these days. Gangsters have to pay rent too. Serve fast food in daytime, prostitutes at night. Otherwise how to afford such sky-high rent? Dad, Mom has given me the Sheung Shui Home Ownership Scheme unit. She transferred the unit to you? You have your own flat. Wow! She loves you that much? She moved in with her new boyfriend, asked me to take care of myself. Good! You've become an elite single. Living together, you two quarrel everyday. It is far away, I don't want to live there! Talk to her for me! I can't help you. I know, I am not your birth daughter. Hak, that's not the point. Your mother's boyfriends are more numerous than convenience stores. We've divorced for years, haven't been in touch at all. Do you think I can... convince her anything? I don't care! You've promised to take care of me. Be good! HOS units are good. Fuck! You need money? Need money? Fuck! Come in! Where are you taking me? Be careful! Stand right here! Look! This hill view, just like New Zealand! Two-bedroom unit, high ceiling, not facing the west. Put a couch here in the sitting room. It's like you are looking at New Zealand every day! I've done price comparison. This area has potential. Will soon be revitalized, old shops kicked out to build new shopping malls. Price will surely go up! Julie! Will you marry me? I know it's more romantic to propose at night. But I want you to show you this condo under sunlight. Am I smart in planning? Lung! Do you love me? Of course! You love me? Put a crib here, no place for the baby stroller. And, what is this all about? Which part looks like New Zealand? New Zealand cemetery is that crowded? There's a strip club right across the street. Do you want our kids hanging around in such an area? Ever thought about our future? I want to have babies! You are so irresponsible! You said no house, no marriage. I'm trying my best. No 1,000 square feet, no marriage. This may not be impossible. We will get there after trading houses for 8 to 10 years. 1,000 square feet. Tai Hang Road. I'll give you 1 year. You are asking me to double my assets? Lung, I love you. But in 8 to 10 years, I will go through menopause. If you can't, let's break up. Okay! 1 year. You won't have menopause so soon. Don't worry. How can I double my assets in one year? Very! Lung! Thanks for teaching me interest calculation, I know it now! The yellow McLaren parked outside... Bought 2 days ago. Lung! I've thought it through. I should not rely on my dad. I'll sell it tomorrow. I come to HK to experience life. I want to experience life too. How about we swap? Sometimes I forgot. I shouldn't be somebody's son. I should be independent! I'll meet my horse-owner uncle on Saturday, wanna come? You just said you wanna experience life? I will take a bus! Driving around in such an expensive thing, how to experience life? Paking Property Agency I have an apartment for sale urgently. Details please! Penthouse with roof at Liberty Mansion, furnished and vacated, 25 mils. Sold on any bid. Hello? Mr Ho! Lung from Paking. Good deal! Buy and sell at once with guaranteed profit. Call me back immediately, okay? Thanks! Bye! Excuse me! I'm looking for a flat... What price range? 3 to 4 mils. Okay, take a look at this. Hello? Mr Chan, Lung from Paking. Good deal! Penthouse with roof at Liberty Mansion, guaranteed profit. Call me back as soon as you get the message. Thanks! Bye! You said an apartment available at Liberty Mansion? It's a big one. This one not okay? Take a look at this one. Excuse me, I have to go out. What kind of service is that? What's the new great unit? Lung, what great unit you have? Hello? Hello? What is your name, Miss? Hey guys, this is Liberty Mansion! Let me introduce you. This is Miss Charlotte. Call me Charlotte! Miss Charlotte, this is Very, Very Wong. Intern in my agency. The McLaren downstairs is his. And this is Hak. She is... A clerk, but she has a HOS unit for sale. Worth couple of mils. I am a courier, not clerk, Dad! You have a grown-up daughter? Yeah, she is my ex-wife's daughter. In a previous marriage. My ex-wife is older than me. Let's cut to the chase. Speculate on luxury flat! Plan is simple; the 4 of us chip in... To pay the down payment and become co-owners. Once the price goes up, sell it immediately. Split the profit and go our own way. Do not put it up for rent in the interim period! Goal is quick profit. Target is to double our assets in one year. Why can we double it? Because this is a super value unit! What's that to do with me? Hak! Your mom gave you a house which you don't like. I'll help you sell it. Use the money to chip in for this! If you became an owner, You can come up every night to admire this spectacular view. Any reasonable offer from buyers, we will sell the flat as long as 3 of us agree to sell. On the contrary, if the offer is too low, We won't sell even if anyone wants to cash in urgently. The other 3 will object anyway. Sounds reasonable, right? Guys, remember. I am not doing a sales pitch. I am in the same boat with you. Be an owner together! I still don't understand. How to calculate? No need to calculate, Very! You want to run up from a shoestring? Here is the chance! Sell the car and double the money in a year to show your father! How manly it is! But... You said you want to experience life, right? Speculate on property! This is HK lifestyle. Friends join hands to do this all the time. It's the trend. I only believe in money, and laws. I've never seen a more spectacular view than this! The seller has already signed. Here are two sets of keys, please acknowledge receipt. What the hell! You like it? Buy it! 170 mils. Today we celebrate the closing of the deal. The flat has inflated 10% since we bought it. A toast for everyone! Why don't we celebrate in our own flat? Our flat is for speculation. Parties would mess up the place. Why not mess up someone else's flat instead? You property agents do this all the time? Owners give you the keys... and you come up to have fun? Some agents even sleep in the flats. One must have aspirations. To get rich, you have to buy this sort of flat. No hope for me. You two might still have a shot. Are you kidding? Dad, I am a courier! Soon you won't be. Don't squat all the time. Ever heard this? Back then someone told me you may not have it now, but one day you will. Invest in money is to invest in happiness. It's true. You teach them this sort of thing? Children are not brought up this way. How do you know? Got any kids? Miss Charlotte, you and I are business partners. Do not challenge my ways of handling things. Right! I forgot you are an opportunist. Are you not? Lung! Breaking News Without any pre-warning, The government suddenly announces new anti-speculation measures. Starting from midnight, stamp duty for buyers will be increased. All non-HK permanent residents, i.e. foreigners and corporate buyers Are required to pay an additional 15% stamp duty. What does that mean? Insiders forecast the market will immediately cool down. (Liberty Mansion) Despite the anti-speculation measures, The market will surely rise again. By that time, You won't be able to find such an apartment. Take a look! Who are you? What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Why so familiar with the light switches? How long have you been living here? What do you want? I've brought clients here. Why don't you tell me? You're not supposed to live here! The maid is cleaning up. You can't live here! Why not? I'm the owner. Am I not? I am! Let go! Excuse me? She's moved in? Excuse me? She's moved in? She has moved in. Theoretically you can't kick her out, she is a co-owner. No offer anyway. All are just browsing. He can still bring clients to see the flat. No clause says owners cannot move in. She's moved in, that means I can move in too? Miss Charlotte, this is not right. You can't do this. Not bad to throw parties here. Indeed! You can't kick her out! Unless add a clause to state owners cannot live in the property. Owners cannot live in the property? That sounds ridiculous, right? Wait! What if they refuse to sign? And insist to live in the flat, what to do? Ask her to pay pro-rata rent! No way! The flat is for speculation. The other owners are not against that. They would mess up the flat if they live there. You move in too! To supervise them! Hey! Don't mess up my hair! Hak! Contract addendum! Sign it! Stop! Sign it! Hey! Very, sign the addendum! Lung, come and party! You brat! Wait till I get out! Divorced and penniless, putting up pretences... To live in luxury flats! Bad example for the kids! Everyone, our lawyer has read the contract. To use it as a dwelling does not forbid it from being sold. Unless you sign an addendum or breach the contract, I cannot offer any help. Hey! I've paid you $4,000! And you said you can't help? Don't touch. Is fake? Get out! Look that way! Taxi! Master-bedroom, first-come-first-served! Go! Go! Why such hurry? Ha! Very Wong Very Wrong! No bed in your room! I'd rather take the servant room. How lonely with such a view! Lung! What's up? No bed in my room. How poor! Come and look at my room. How's that? Lung! Good luck! Hey! What're you doing? People hate to buy flats with tenants. Which means the place is messy, it's a turn-off! No. 1 rule to sell a flat - never let clients see the reality! What does it mean? I now officially announce. The flat must be restored to its vacated condition by 9:00 every morning. If we can't sell it, We are doomed and stuck with one another for life. Do not...treat this as your home. Keep it tidy, okay? That's easy! What's your birth father look like? I hope he's like this. Hey! Your pyjamas are awful. You two brat! I swear I'll beat you to death. How can you mess up the place like this? Clean up quickly! Do it! Whose underpants? Very's. Put it away! Hurry! You think it's funny? You are a co-owner too! You're all mad! Wow! What a unique hair! Pubic hairs are always so conspicuous! Can be spotted right away. Some like to hide in the dark. But some are more open. Like to show itself. At high spots! What do you think? Whose hair is it? I don't care, I won't touch it. Judging by its colour and texture, It should be yours! Collect it. You're crazy! Mad! Mad! Mad! Why don't you pick it up? Alright, keep it there. Maybe not that conspicuous. This is not conspicuous? Problem fixed. Thank Hak for covering up your hair! How can you deny your own hair? So heartless. Bedroom or kitchen? Whose sock? It stinks! Where to put the newspaper? My shoes! No space for them. My slippers! Where to put them? Whatever! Look!This view is so nice. This view is so nice. Look!This view is so nice. All women love this brand, right? My colleague wears that too. You're kidding! Your colleague? Look! Genuine brand! They all look similar, with red soles. How much is it? Depends on the style. Every woman should have a pair of Christian Louboutin. So tall, like an Avatar. Hate to go up this slope. Liberty Mansion is nightmare. Miss, look how jammed it is... How about you get off here and walk? It'll be faster! So I can U-turn and go. Are you crazy? You ask me to walk up the hill in such high heels? Like I'm refusing to pay. Got it. Rich people love to buy high heels. But refuse to walk a short distance. Okay, no problem. (Successfully attained glass door installation for wet market) Turn around and go downhill! Hurry up! Where to? I want to lodge a complaint. Please fill in the form. I want to complain immediately. Please fill in the form immediately. The traffic jam problem on the road uphill is very serious. If you can solve that, many people will benefit. And you'll gain a lot of votes. Works much better than 100 posters. Please calm down, citizen! Excuse me. I need to make a call first. Wait a while please! Hello! This is Yip Lau Suk Chi. Why is the fee for mosquito eradication at Lai Yin Estate so expensive? Much more expensive than at Lai Shuk Estate last time. Are you overcharging us because we are the District Office? Give me another quote! Must be faster and better than the government, understand? Sorry! Sorry! Citizen, how can I help you? The traffic light here, no one cross the road here. But cars have to wait, nonetheless. Here, parking meters installed suddenly. The road is narrowed. And here, always road work. For what? God knows. It's forever under repair. I passed by in taxi for years; it's under repair for years. Like digging all the way to South Pole. Also, the spot here... It is where all traffic is jammed. Because cars going to the other hill also go through here. All jammed. Completely blocked up? So remove the traffic lights and parking meters, quicken the road work. More importantly, the jammed spot.. Cars on this side go like this, cars on that side go like that. Actually cars on this side just need to turn that way. Via here, here, here and turn right. Then they can go in the same direction! You are using quite a lively presentation. I heard you are asking to change the traffic network of the entire hill. That's right. Are you in traffic planning? No, but I take a lot of taxis. Despite I take taxis and never walk, I know there's no easy job. I know that too. Lung? Just got off the plane? A foreign pilot is looking for a flat. I asked him to call on you. Good. When? Now! Now? Someone to see the flat! He's downstairs. Hurry! Your pajamas are...really ugly! Help to clean up! Done. Hurry! Morning! Come and take a look! Ever seen Transformer? Bought it on Taobao! Hello! I am Lung. Please come in! He is Very Wong, intern at Paking Property Agency. Very Wong Come in, have a look! It's nice? This way please! Checkmate! They are...for display. Lovely! I love this apartment. This way! Please do not smoke here, mind about other's health. Please do not control others, mind about their mental health. Checkmate! You know what? A beautiful apartment like this makes you miss your family more. Lung, what did he say? Who cares! As long as he buys. I ask you not to smoke because it is bad for health. None of your business! Are you my mom? Save it! Your parents didn't teach you manners? Yeah...how's that? I have no manners! I think I should leave. Wait! What did you say to Hak? Nothing. You drove my client away! What to do now? We run after her? We? I didn't piss her off, why should I go? I'm sorry. My mom gave birth to me at 16. Ignored me ever since as if I didn't exist. I speculate on flats with my stepdad. How could I have manners? I'm sorry! It's alright, you're speaking the truth. It's normal. Don't be upset. Marriage fails all the time. It's normal. Marriage is doomed to fail, those that work are miracles! Perhaps Lung is still entertaining the client. No need to lie, I know him well. Not good for him... Why? You still don't understand? I don't care you criticize me. What I care is you criticize him. I've known him since I was small. He was different then. Hasn't given up to fate yet. I still remember that unyielding look of his. My mom has had many men... Only Lung... Bothers to take notice of me. Miss, want to see the flats? To see flats? Charlotte! It's you. To see flats! You agents are terrible, tore my pantyhose. Well, those who are underfed don't care about life. News said agents often get into fight to seize clients. A huge fight right here yesterday. Excuse me. Here comes a client! To see flats? Madam! Miss, see the flats? Excuse me! Madam! Excuse me! Thank you Madam! Excuse me! Charlotte! You know one another? Wait! Please take this! Charlotte! Long time no see. Why did you hide away? I did not! He is... My agent, just bumped into him. Good for you to make friends. You like him? He's good! A great help to my husband and me in buying flats. Too bad my husband is busy today. So your husband is too busy to come with you today... Come here! My baby, isn't he cute? Both my hubby and I think he's super cute. His voice is so loud! Say hi! Madam! No, not madam. Miss, she's single! Good for you to make new friends. My husband and I are fine. Just a petty quarrel! I knew all about it. Martin and I had dinner with him last night. How is he? He looked great! Just a few million dollars break-up fees... And you accepted? Why not asked for more? How about see some flats? How about that? Is this good? Take me! Excuse me? Quota is met today. Buy from him! Already? Okay, show me the way! Okay, I'll show you! You know the old lady next door well? I told my husband... 10 years! 10 years is a long time, does that count? He took out a calculator. And said let's say I earned 30K each month. That's 3.6 mils in 10 years, round it up to 4 mils. I asked him why talked about money. He cried. He said he didn't know how to repay me the 10 years. I said fine. I'll take the 4 mils first. Sort out the rest later. You're so dumb! I was a first-honours graduate in hotel management. A prom queen. You know the philosophy of hotel management? 4 words. To earn more money! He proposed to me right after I graduated. He said no matter how beautiful a hotel was, It's no better than a home. He also said hotel is temporary. Home... Is for lifetime! I've invested all my youth... In a place which accommodates only him. Sometimes I think. Perhaps he wants to try out other hotels. Sooner or later, he will know our home is the best. Those who get used to hotels will never come home! Marriage is for life! 10 years! You know what that means to me? That means everything to me, my life, my habits... What I do every day, what I think every day. What am I after divorce? I am nothing! What should I do? What should I think every day? Can you tell me? What should I do? What should I think every day? Can you tell me? I can. Money! Use the break-up fees to speculate. Right thing to do! I need money. I want to buy back our flat. I can't be empty-handed. No matter how down and out, I have to know the way home. Where's your flat? I can help you check. No thanks! I can do it myself. I know you will say I am an idiot. But I do have a hunch that my husband will come back! When he comes back, everything will resumes to normal. Everything will be same as before. I know what you agents would think? Flats are to be traded! No one would live there for life! I know! I know! I know! I know! But I am not convinced. I don't think you are an idiot. Smart of you to use the breakup fees to speculate on properties. Mere talk of love is rare. You really think so? Tomorrow is our wedding anniversary. Do you think he will call me? He will. He will. Perhaps. Do me a favor, please don't bring anyone to view our place. Open it! There is empty space, you don't let me in. Open it! Put the things you borrowed back on my desk! Why so happy? Get back to work! Work! Hello! Lunch together? Yeah. But I still got some work. You wait here. Won't take long! What happened with the foreign pilot I introduced to you? Gather all papers and get to the Sai Ying Pun site immediately! 3% commission is offered! The market is slack. Our only way out! Okay. I'll get the car! Hurry! Hurry up! Call me later! Wait! How did you know this brand? Nice, isn't it? Who taught you? You only know Armani. I learnt this brand recently. You met someone out there? You're doing some funny shit. What funny shit? Do not waste money again. Thanks! You get to work, I'll go. Okay, you go. I'll call you after work and we'll have dinner, okay? Okay. Ready yet? Ready? Hey! To compete with those dyed-hair rogues? They are fighters! See? That is the proper working attitude. Learn it! Lung, I'll give you a lift. Okay. Go! Hey! I'll take the bus. Forget about him! Go! Come on! Hurry up! Mr Tsui! Call me Sidney! Still working? You bought my flat. How's it? Good. Wanna see some flats? Yeah! 100 to 200 mils detached house. Sure! We have everything. Good for you! Come to the site later. 3% commission No dogs allowed in the shop! Bye! Can you take care of my dog for a while? No problem. When to see flats? Take care of the dog for me. When I come back, will go see. Great! I wait for you, get back soon (Husband, how are you?) The dog is shitting everywhere. Pick it up! Sidney, may I ask how much longer for you to come back? It's urgent! Please call me back. Thank you. Do it! Or I'll call the police. Okay. Property agents are all assholes. (Manager Wilson: Very's great!) (He got a customer within minutes) (And sold 3 flats) I'm sorry. My girlfriend asked me to drop her something at her place. But when I got there... She's all naked. So I had to...drop down something. I'm so sorry. When can you see houses? Thank you. I mean it. I'm looking for a house. But I'm not free today. Another day perhaps! Call me, thank you! You want some cakes? I've brushed my teeth. No thanks! It's good! Okay, brush again. Charlotte! I know you must be very upset today. But you have to remember. No matter what happens, Do not commit suicide in this flat! Or else it can't be sold, okay? Sorry, only jelly is left. They look so beautiful! Are they good? Good! Really? Really! Really good? Really good! What're you doing? I don't know. What're you doing? No kidding! Don't you know what that is? Quick! Quick! Quick! Wow, so clean? Laser hair removal, permanent. So the hair last time is really not yours? Sorry to blame you. Shut up! Get a condom! It glows? My husband's collectible item! Give me back! How? Give me back! Already torn open. Take if off! Okay, how much is it? Give me back! Only a few bucks! Give me back! You know what I like about you? Don't know? Your confidence. Your indestructible confidence. I'm taller than you. I like tall women. Tall and natural. Here you are! Hiding in your gallery. Dad, I'm not hiding, I do go home. Mr Yang! Sidney, take a look! What do you think? I don't know. Honest! Among all my staff, you are the most honest. You know now why I want to move out. You promised to move in with me. When're we going to see houses? Hello! What a coincidence! Hi! How are you? Fine. Do you still remember me? Of course, I remember your apartment as well. Last time you loved my apartment. Yes, but it's too small. My wife is relocating to HK with our 4 children. HK is gonna be our home. My apartment is still for sale. Okay, your home. But maybe double the size? Double? What about same floor, flats A and B? Hello? You are familiar with the old lady next door, right? Convince her to sell her flat! Okay. Been neighbours for so long but haven't paid you a visit. I've brought you some sweet soup. Thank you. Hello? Have you convinced the old lady? The agent. Let me. No need to talk anymore! Young man, stop doing this dirty business! Beware of comeuppance! Thank you! Eat the sweet soup. I can see my flat from here. You pay first? Hak! Lung! What're you guys doing here? A client with cheque! How's the old lady? I'll go up to convince her. Something happened. What? The old lady said no? Charlotte, you are useless. Just now when I got off work... They were talking about Hak downstairs. We'll deal with that later. Tell me, how's the old lady? She won't sell. Mr Lubke, I promise. I will call you tomorrow. There'll be good news! Yeah, I promise. Thank you! Hak, tell your father yourself. It's none of his business! We just happen to live under the same roof. Your daughter... Is in date-style prostitution. Is it true? It doesn't work! Think you're still a kid? How can you try date-style prostitution? How much can you make? You're not as beautiful as Fan Bingbing. Have you started yet? Did you sleep with him? Did you do it? Hak said her day job is very tough. Tough? Everyone's job is tough! Be contented. At least you got a flat from your mother. What about me? Who would give me? Right! I have a flat, I should be happy! Every one of you is mad! Craving for a house all the time. You have it, so what? Does it mean you have a home? You...are hopeless! Don't tell others I taught you this! Lung Hong! I am so disappointed in you. Disappointed? You know anything about the world? You have no right to be disappointed. You said one must look far ahead. That's all you can see now but you fail to see what's around you. Come on! You came aboard for the fun only. Why lecturing me all these? I joined because I trusted you. Sell the apartment quickly. I wanna move out. I quit! I was fired today. You hijacked all clients to see your own flat, everyone knows about it. What for? Money problem? Okay. Farewell! See you around! You're firing me now? You know I am in crital stage... See you around! One year's deadline is up. I was fired. And the flat still unsold. After our reserve money in the bank is used up, We have to start repaying... The mortgage. Won't work even if all of us engage in date-style prostitution. Except you. My dad won't help. Don't even think about it! Of course I know. If your father knows I got you into such shit, I won't be able to stay in this business anymore. Who is your dad? My dad is... How about this? Let's not be so greedy. Just sell the apartment to break even. And forget the whole thing, alright? I've never been in such deep shit before. Let us all pray for god's blessing. Pray! Dear God, please help us sell this apartment. We are not greedy. We are grateful for the food and shelter you gave us. But the shelter brings about problems. Client coming! He's downstairs. Hurry up! Handbag! Leave it! Go! Go! Let's go! For display! Mr Tsui! Come on in and take a look! I know you used to live here. Never mind them, they are leaving. Have some tea! Oh! What's up? Tell me! Clients are here. Nothing! Sidney, you've come back! Honey! You are... I am his wife! Nothing much to see, let's go! Your ex-wife is her? Honey, you've wandered out to live in hotels for a while. Good for you to know the way home. The apartment you said you want to buy back... To wait for your husband is this one? Why is it so cheap? The owner just got divorced. It's really beautiful! Insiders forecast the market will immediately cool down Miss Charlotte, how long will your friend stay here? I am your friend? If someone persuades you to sell the flat, do not trust him! Someone asks you to sell? Sell it or not? Of course not! The price is not satisfactory. You...bought the flat? How come you have the money? Sidney, why is she still living here? I, of course live here. To defend this home. I know you would come back. I insist on seeing this flat. Sidney said this is his old flat so I come to see his memories. The hair is gone! Is it really that hair? You said your wife is as beautiful as Princess Diana. I am a man with virtue. Memories are always hazy. You still love her? Of course not! Hey... Forget about love! We have to sell the flat, Charlotte! This is where we tried out every brand of condoms available in HK. This room is for the baby. This couch, another place to try out condoms. The kitchen is where I first learned to cook. First learned how to take care of another person... While feeling proud and honoured. This house is filled with my memories. Because of it, I learned how to love a person. I won't sell it no matter at what price. My memories cannot be bought. Okay, how much? I'll buy. Not you! I buy. What's the asking price? Well, let's sit down and discuss. 32 mils? 33 mils? I won't sell! I won't sell! I won't sell! Sometimes we have to learn... How to let go of the past. Both the person and the house. 40 mils? Deal! Even if I sell, I won't sell it to you. Hey, there are 4 owners for this flat. If 3 of us agree, you can't say no. Give it to my father to manage. Thank you. You can buy it but your father doesn't need to know. I won't sell! I think the people inside is more important than the house. What's wrong with you? You... What's your problem? What? Oh my god! They are all crazy! Forget them! What's more important is us, right? Let's go! Why didn't you tell me? Excuse me! Let's go! Perhaps it's Charlotte's. It's not Charlotte's! How do you know? What's your relationship with her? You two are having a fling? Lure me to buy this? No! I can explain. There is really nothing between us. Didn't my husband tell you he hates hairy things? You said you like me being natural. Natural? He's lying! He lied to me today and he will lie to you tomorrow! I never want to see you again. Goodbye! No! Lynn, listen! According to plan, I will be boarding a private jet in two hours... To go to Vietnam to have noodles. Give me back my noodles! Why did I say you look like Princess Diana? You want me to say my ex-wife is average, a dime a dozen? Say it again. You are an unnaturally tall average. Get a life, please! Why keep harassing me? I am no longer young. This girl's father is my last shot! Now it's gone! All gone! All gone! Hey, mind the table... What's the big deal? Do you know how much efforts I've put in? My hair is thinning. For fear she might notice, I wear a hat all the time. Even when it's over 30 degrees. My eyesight is failing; I dare not use reading glasses. No! Insist to read books even I can't see well. You know I have rheumatism. But I dare not show it. Never yell out for pain during rainy weathers. No pain! This is no longer your home, please leave. My last shot! Thank you very much! Charlotte, you win! The hair helps you gain back your dignity. The people inside more important than the house? Am I one of them? I bought this because I want to get married. I was forced to double my assets. Deadline is up. Girlfriend will go. Marriage is off. Forget this kind of girl. Forget this kind of girl. Would another girlfriend be different? Treat her as my client; why not take the old one? To live... Is troublesome! He admits he gives in to fate. Give in to fate, saves me a lot of trouble. No need to think so much. You're 40, got fired. Difficult to find another job in such market. You have no other skill. And co-own a flat you can't afford to pay mortgage. The market is slack; you can't sell even if you want. Right! We are reasonable people. You will understand me. I don't want to do this either. Take care! Miss! You may not know me. But I know Lung Hong. I want to tell you he has done a lot for you. I don't know your relationship. Excuse me, got to go to work. Miss! He loves you! Lung Hong loves you! Anyone can love anyone. Love is worthless. All love and no bread, see if it can fill your stomach. I want achievement, I want responsibility. I want the ability to raise a family. That is love. Imagine you are in the house, But the person who lives with you will never come back. It'd be meaningless even if it's a big one. You'd never tried that, you wouldn't understand. That's right! I've seen such a person, I understand. I don't know what's wrong with you. You've become so impractical! How long have I slept? What time is it? How about we go pick Hak up from work? We'll see. Hak is well-behaved, she found a new job. We'll see. Hey, dinner? Wait! Wait! Clear the way! Clear the way! Watch your back! This bag is for Kwun Tong! When we're up there, don't make any noise. So cold here! This is where bank confidential papers are kept. Class One Protection. In other words, Title deeds! The deeds you mortgage to the bank, they are kept here. Deeds! Deeds! Deeds! Deeds! All are title deeds! Hak, what you want to eat? Whatever! You go get the car, I have to wrap up. Lung, spirit up! Like you said... If one leaves, find another one. I don't care. I just want to cook tonight. You have to eat it. Why do you look so alright? And know how to comfort me? One is strong doesn't mean one is not hurt. I am strong because you are not. I want to be the less strong one too! You love to hang on to your pride. It's good to have something to hang onto. You know what is the saddest thing in the world? To realize no one needs you anymore. No one needs me either! Who says no one needs you? Use your stupid brain to think! Hak follows you because she believes in you, she needs you. She told me she's seen the look of you with a soul. Please, show me that look again! Silly girl! No one has ever praised me like that. What's wrong? A hair again? Are you scared? Yeah! I'm really afraid! I don't know. I need you to say three words to me right now. I love you? I am sorry! Thanks very much. Eat! Have some orange! (Mortgage payment overdued) (Last warning) Wear a nice suit to work. A pair of nice pajamas when you get home. If you don't treat yourself well, what's the point of living up on the peak? You like it? Yes, and turned on! (Eviction Day) The flat will be seized by the bank soon, what to do? Game over together or have BBQ? I like you. You have the courage to experience life. Hello.
