Unit 40 requesting assistance. We have a possible 211 in progress at the Valley Trust Bank, Boyle and Kittridge. We have shots fired. All units, officer needs assistance. Boyle, north of Kittridge, at the Valley Trust Bank. Shots have been fired. We're going to need some type of heavy-duty vehicle to do this because we are all pinned down by automatic gunfire. 15-L-10, advise. You need some kind of heavy-duty machinery to get the officer up. They've got automatic weapons. There's nothing we have that can stop them. Shots being fired! Shots being fired! Suspects heavily armed and wearing body armor. Officer down! Officer down! Requesting SWAT. Code 3. I'm killing whoever moves! You move, I'm killing you! What are you looking at, huh? What are you looking at? SWAT's just arrived. We're 30 seconds out, boys. All right. Let's rock 'n' roll. This is a table. We have four cameras over the tellers. Do we have a visual? Almost. We cut their phones? Yes, sir. As soon as you get tapped in, let me have it. 10-David standing by, position three. Suspect's trying to get in the driver-side door. Do not let them get mobile. He's down. God damn it! Grab somebody. Grab somebody and bring them up here! Get up. No. I said get up! No! Let's throw a body out there and tell them we mean business. Street, 10-David. The storeroom is clear, almost to the lobby. Shut up! 10-David to Street. Hold your position. 10-David wants us to hold. God damn it! God damn it! We hold, they die. I guess we're not holding. I swear to God, I'm going to kill somebody! Take a headshot. They just capped Eddie! How the hell are we going to get out of here? Shut up! I'm thinking! 10-David to all units. We are sending in a secure phone. Stop whining! I'll put a bullet in your head! Shut up. What are they doing? This is Rick from the LAPD. Can you hear me okay? 10-David to Street. Hold your position. CNT has him on the phone. 10-David to the one-four corner. Confirm that you have containment. Roger, we're holding on the one-four corner. 10-David to all units. Confirm that you're holding. 10-David, we're holding top of stairwell. Shut up. Gamble, Street, where the hell are you? Why aren't you responding? Let's be cool, now. Calm down. I'm controlling this situation, you understand me? We need to go! No, please. Help me. Gamble, Street. Why aren't you responding? Now! Kill that bitch and throw her out front! Get that guy off our fence! I said to kill that bitch and throw her out front! I'm on TV! Street, 10-David. Lobby is clear. Two suspects are neutralized. I need an RA unit for a gunshot wound to a hostage. You're going to be fine, ma'am. Ambulance is on the way. Got them, right? Jimbo? She'll be okay? I'm not a doctor. You're going to be fine. You're going to be fine. Mmm-mmm, mmm. Boss is going to tear you guys a new one, huh? Same place he did the last time, time before that... Good luck. I don't care what they say. You guys were heroes out there. That was some cocky shit out there. You know how to play this, right? That woman is alive because of what we did. Yeah, alive and suing the city for millions. Chief says if he's going to pay, somebody else does too, and it sure as hell isn't going to be me. Come on, Fuller. We get two seconds to make... Captain Fuller. Captain Fuller, we get two seconds to make a decision. You get two months to sit there and tear it apart. SWAT means "Special Weapons and Tactics." Where were your tactics out there? Saving a woman from getting shot. That's where our tactics were. Every cop in this department knows we did the right thing. Sometimes doing the right thing isn't doing the right thing. What the hell does that mean? Sergeant... You disobeyed a direct order. End of story. You're both off SWAT. Captain... They're two of our best officers. Well, I'm not sticking them back in the field after a stunt like that. Sorry. I didn't know that saving lives was a goddamn stunt. Hey, you've got a big mouth, and apparently, you're quick on the trigger, and that is why your ass is in a sling. Captain Fuller, if you're going to put them off SWAT, at least keep them in the division. Give them a shot at getting back. Fine. Stick them in the gun cage. Get them out of my sight. Gun cage? This is total bullshit. What? I said, "This is bullshit." Really? Yeah, really. You should consider yourself lucky Lieutenant Velasquez is standing up for you. Yeah, I'm lucky I don't have to work for an asshole like you... That's it! You're out of here, Gamble! You're gone! Get out of here. What the hell's the matter with you? Street! You stay. Hey... Give us a minute. Please, sit down, hmm? I'll stand. Look, Jim, we both know that Gamble is a bad influence on the rest of the team. Gamble's a good cop. Unlike him, you still have a chance at a future here. You go on record that Gamble acted recklessly and that you had no choice but to follow your partner in after he disobeyed orders, and I will make sure that you are back on SWAT tomorrow morning. Let's get the hell out of here, huh? I need a cocktail. I'm staying. You're what? What? After that? Couple months, Fuller will find some new asses to chew out. We'll be back on the team. Fuller is the cockroach of this department, brother. He's not going to give us any second chance. What are you going to do, huh? Piss away all the hard work you did to get here? Piss what away, Jimmy? The cage? Come on, man. We're better than that, and you know it. You going to come with me? Oh. A real partner wouldn't have to ask that, would he? A real partner would step up to what he did in the bank. Yeah. I saved the hostage. You disobeyed the hold. No, I saved that hostage. You disobeyed the hold! You made the decision yourself, and you shot a hostage. Jesus, Brian! Wow. You sound a lot like Fuller. Is that what you two were talking about in there? Did you rat me out? Did you cut a deal to get back on the team, Jimmy? Did I cut a deal? Yeah, did you? How many times have I covered up for one of your goddamn stunts? That's what a partner's supposed to do. You just picked a paycheck over me, bro. You just picked yourself over everything else. You want to stay here and be Fuller's bitch, you go right ahead. I can't do it. Can't do it. Damn it. God damn it. God damn it, Jim! Partners for five years. This is how you want to end it. Oh... I didn't end it. You sold me out to the brass. You know I never realized till now how full of shit you are. Fuck you and SWAT. * Shattered * Shattered * Love and hope and sex and dreams * Are still surviving On the streets * Look at me I'm in tatters * I've been shattered * Shattered * Friends are so alarming My lover's never charming * Life's just a cocktail party On the street * Big apple * People dressed in plastic bags Directing traffic... * You're a little too attached to that soda, Gus. Love that stuff. The wife would have my behind if she busted me sucking that down. Why, is she a Mr. Pibb fan? You know the deal, Jim. When we got married, I converted to Mormonism. We can't consume anything that alters our state of mind. We treat our bodies with respect. And I treat mine like an amusement park. It's the differences that make this country great. Need them cleaned by the morning, boys. You were supposed to have your gear in a half-hour ago. What, your boy going to report me to the captain? Just for thinking you look good in that mustache. Your mom seems to like it, though. So does your sister. Hey, Sarge. Welcome back! Look who's back. Welcome back, Sarge. What's up, Hondo? Hey, Sarge. Howdy. What do you need? Sergeant Hondo? You're back. Well, you know what they say, Gus. You're either SWAT or you're not. Yes, sir. What can I do for you? Oh, just a tune-up, but please, don't touch my sights, and I made some modifications... To the trigger too. And you are? Jim Street. Street. Yeah, we'll leave them intact. I need that back by tomorrow. Can do, Sergeant. Good to see you. Good seeing you. Gosh, Gus, is that a woody? Heck, yeah. That's Hondo. He's old-school SWAT. The gold standard of ass-kicking. Sorry, butt-kicking. I guess he's back. I guess he is. A week-long series, attacking us top to bottom. And it's all SWAT's fault, right? No, the Chief's been pretty fair about blaming everyone. He does want these bad headlines to end. He wants the old warhorses to help restore the luster. Old? I know you ain't talking about me. You've got to shake off that three-year rust from Rampart, because I'm throwing you in the shit right away. Sooner the better. I want you to put together a young, kick-ass element for me, Dan. You select them. You train them. You mold them. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I know you're not talking about giving me five pups fresh out of the gate, are you? Because I didn't come back to wipe noses. Hell, no. Now, you worked with T.J. and Boxer at Southwest. You're up for supervising them here? That's a start. Now, all you have to do is find three fresh ones. Only catch is Fuller has to approve the three. What did Captain Fuller have to say when he heard the Chief was bringing me back? Hasn't stopped swearing since. What's your brother's truck doing outside? We're having a garage sale I don't know about? You weren't supposed to be home for an hour. Sorry to screw up your getaway. Look, let's not make this a thing, okay? We both knew it was coming. It's not like we were in this to get married, right? And... You've changed since... Well, people change. Look, when it was good, it was great, right? That means something. Yeah, thanks. Damn it! Hey! Hey! I'm going to throw this thing out. You do and you die. Every SWAT team in the world's going to have one someday. It's 50 pounds of scrap metal. All right. Say you've got some crazy suspect barricaded in a house. All right. Just chain this to the back of a truck, shove this end right through the wall... These rods spring out like fishhooks. Your partner guns the truck, takes the whole wall with him. And we waltz right in and surprise the bad guy, right? Correct. I call it "The Key to the City." Patent pending. Is that right? Right. Let me get your M4. And... You took the rattle out of the receiver. Yeah, new buffer, new gas rings, cleaned the gas tube. I'm surprised you didn't starch the sling. If you want me to show you how to shoot it, I'm here all week, 9:00 to 5:00. Shooters, on the line! Stand by! Ready! Put them on safe and holster. No roll, Hondo? How do you know I didn't? You didn't, did you? They only roll in John Woo movies, not real life. All right. Here's the winner. There's a few people that I would like to thank. My fellow SWAT officers, all of you, thank you for believing in me when the bosses didn't give me a chance. Oh. Yeah, that's why you're the marksman, and I'm the guy who tells you who to shoot. Here you go. I've got you covered since I let you down. Tell you what. I've got a hundred here that says that guy can kick your ass. Are you kidding me, Hondo? Come on. He's our gun bunny. Oh, well, let's make it 200, then. Sure. A couple more lap dances for me tonight. Want a piece of this? Yeah. Don't look so worried. Yo. Want to make some extra money? Hey, don't forget to take your safety off. Street, you'd better get your game face on. Don't beat him so badly I can't get a rematch, all right? I won't make any promises. It's my money, man. Shooters, on the line! Stand by! Ready! Put them on safe! Holster! Here's your winner. Ka-ching! Yee-haw! I won, baby. Thoroughbred. Yeah, yeah. Passport, please. Sir? Next. Bonjour. Merci beaucoup. Next. You have anything to declare? I don't know how you got this through De Gaulle. You can't bring this through the airport. Qu'est-ce que c'est la knife avec la suitcase? Um, for luck, luck. Gift from my father. Not dangerous. Mail it home. Okay. Mail it home. Okay, okay. Merci. Okay? Hey, Gus. Yeah? Isn't that eternal damnation you're chowing down there? You can't tell Michelle. Isn't she going to smell the fries on your breath? That's why God invented mouthwash. She'll never know. Gus, you're cheating on your wife with fast food. You're right. You're absolutely right. Street, you have a driver's license? Got a library card. It's good enough. So get your uniform on. You're driving me today. Come on. Did you get my return ticket and papers? Flight leaves tonight at midnight. No one knows I'm here? Just me. Where do you want to go? It's my uncle's birthday. I want to surprise him. If you want me to come by and mow your lawn later, I'm available, Sergeant. I'll keep that in mind. Call me Hondo. I was a Marine, Did two years in 'Nam, recon unit. Spent the next four teaching combat survival. You serve? Yeah. Navy SEALs, right? That's what my file says. So what did you do for them? Besides rescue Marines when they got lost? You sniper detail, amphibious assault, what? My boat-crew leader always said if anyone knew what we did, we'd failed. That's fair enough. So where are we going, Hondo? What say we go see what the weather's like over in South Central? Tell us where your boyfriend is. Look, I don't speak Spanish! Tell me where your boyfriend is! You're not helping him any! You're not... Somebody here going to get locked up. R-61-15 in foot pursuit. Suspect headed south, west of Defiance. One black male in Lakers purple. Puerco. Puerco? Repeat! One black male in Lakers purple. That's our guy talking. Where's he at? What the hell you doing, Navy SEAL? Oh, hell, yeah! Get on, baby, get on! Come on! Yee... Haw! Hey, wait! Damn, that looked like some Oakland Raiders Jack Tatum action there. What you know about Jack Tatum? Get out of here. Turn your ass over. Put your hands behind your back. Name's Hondo. I don't give a damn what your name is. I could've caught him on my own. If you like hard work, long hours, and getting dirty for low pay, I got an opening on my SWAT team. Ooh, man. Shut up! I don't mind that at all. Pack your bags. You're coming to SWAT school. SWAT school? Shut up! Don't talk too much. Shut up. Don't y'all got nothing better to do than be hauling another black man off to jail? Just perpetuating the cycle, ain't you? We'll see how liberal you are when he's breaking in your place. Uh-huh. "Uh-huh," my ass. Sure you don't want to sit in the back? I could wear a little cap. I like the view from up here. The cap thing is a nice touch, though. Officer Burress, Southwest Division. So your test scores are off the chart, and you've got all the right references. Thank you, Sergeant. Can I get a hot dog with everything and a ginger ale, please? Huh? Hot dog with everything and ginger ale. Street? Same. Well, I will have a soy dog, please, on a whole-wheat bun, plain, and a... A tomato juice, if you've got it. Thank you. I'm a vegetarian. I'm a bit curious. Um... You've been a cop six years, and you've never had a civilian complaint against you? Well, I try to be courteous and professional with everyone I encounter. Well, the thing is, Dave... David. Right, David. Um, here's the thing. There may come a time in SWAT when you've got to get a little dirty behind a street bust. Do you know what I'm saying? No. How the hell can I trust a man who won't eat a good old-fashioned American hot dog? And he's a vegetarian. I'm looking for an injured officer. Name is Sanchez, Chris Sanchez. Room five, in the corner. Thank you. Hey, what do you need, Sarge? You're Sanchez's partner? Mmm-hmm. Sanchez do that? Mmm-hmm. You help? No, Sarge. Reminds me of my third divorce. Bad day, huh? Kiss my ass, ese. I'm starting to like this Sanchez already. He spent four years in Metro, passed the SWAT quals three times, been rejected by Fuller three times. Might be a reason. He's got a couple of beefs here. Hmm. I'm going to get the nurse to clean and dress your wound. Sorry, wrong room. Who you looking for? Chris Sanchez. I'm Chris Sanchez. You're Chris Sanchez? Look, if you're Internal Affairs, that guy had double-edged razor blades in his mouth. I had to put him down hard. I'm sick and tired of these bullshit complaints because some vato doesn't like getting thrown to the pavement by a woman. I look like I.A.D. to you? Who are you? Wait, now, that guy had about 100 pounds on you. All brawn, no brains. You didn't answer my question. So you still want to work SWAT? No, I just enjoy applying all the time. Gas it up. Return it. Am I looking at another day of chauffeur duty? Team's almost filled. Not that it hasn't been fun. Well, I do have one more spot. Can you think of anybody I might have overlooked? Is this a game or a test, Sergeant? Could be a bit of both. Yeah, I'm a little old for games. All right. So how'd you like to be back on SWAT? It's not going to happen. So why you hanging around the cage, then? It's a job. And SWAT's a calling. Anybody around you for five minutes can tell you've still got the bug. All you've got to do is say yes. It's not up to me or you. I've got a history here. Yeah, let's talk about that. I heard some rumors about you and your old partner. Did you give him up in Fuller's office? Because, you know, team members got to trust each other. Okay. I'm not on your team... And no, I didn't give him up. You've been in that cage six months, shining boots and fixing weapons, waiting for a second chance. I've got one, and I'm offering it to you. Fuller will never sign off on it. You let me deal with that paper-pushing punk. I want you on my team. Let me tell you. It's the sauce. If you don't have the right sauce, what do you got? You know? Now, my mother, she used to make sauce. Now you go into the store, and you buy it in a jar or in a can... Oh! Alex? Alex! Nobody told me you were coming. When did you get here? Surprise. Happy birthday, Uncle. Come on, sit down. Sit. Bring some champagne, huh? Sit, eat. The chief's making me take you back. He's concerned about losing all his best officers to other cities. He thinks I'm one of his best officers? But he's given me complete oversight, and trust me, you've got no room for error. So I will give you Boxer, T.J. McCabe, and this new guy, Deacon Kaye. I'm going to have to pass the other two. Sanchez is a woman, and Street... Well, Street's on my shit list. Hey, I'm on your shit list too, and I'm the team leader. You work for me now, and it's my team to choose. With all due respect, Captain, other leaders get to pick their teams. And you can too. Just pick two new people. Look. Just give me the team I ask for. You can even call it your "shit list team." That way, if anything goes wrong, you can put all the blame on me. It'd be just like old times. Okay. Okay, you've got your team, but when you fail, and you probably will fail, Sanchez goes back to traffic, and you and your boy Street are plain gone. No, not just off SWAT, off the force. You feel me? Oh, yeah, I feel you. Okay, I'm leaving now. No, don't go. I have wine and cognac from home. Come on. I must go. I have a flight to catch. Oh, catch another flight. Let me introduce you to Monica. You like this knife? This is my father's knife. He gave it to me. It's a beautiful knife, and she's a beautiful woman. Now, why don't you stay, have a good time, and go back tomorrow? Listen, I'm running the business now. I'm the new boss. Don't joke with me, Alex, and don't ever forget, your father's running the business. No, I retired him. He never spoke of that to me. That's because he can't speak anymore. You put your hand in my father's pocket... Not in mine. If you take my money, I'll take your life. Understood? Pas de probleme. Mail it to me. * Nothing ever stops all these thoughts * And the pain attached to them * Sometimes I wonder why this is happening * It's like nothing I can do will distract me * When I think of how * I shot myself in the back again * It never goes away It never goes away * And now * You've become a part of me * You'll always be right here * You've become a part of me * You'll always be my fear * I can't separate * Myself from what I've done * Giving up a part of me * I've let myself become you * You, you Good evening. Sir, may I see your license, registration, and proof of insurance? I'm a tourist, you know, I'm visiting the U.S. I have my passport if you want. Let me see it. Whose car is this? It belongs to my uncle. Why? You've got a left taillight out. Hi. This is Bridget the Midget, and we're out here in front of the Key Club on Sunset in beautiful Hollywood. I just wonder how it is you can get inside of there. Anyways, we're on Sunset Boulevard, where anything could happen, especially police harassment. Hey, you guys, you're all pigs! Is your uncle's name Martin Gascoigne? Yeah, so we're okay? There's an arrest warrant in that name, and I have to detain you until we can verify who you are. Sir, please step out of the vehicle. You're here awful early. Traffic was lighter than usual. Streets must've been damn near empty. Ali's his sister. And I called bottoms on the last one I won. Now, you called bottoms, but that's not what you got. Yo, dawg, what's up? What's happening, man? Jim. Boxer. So, what did you do to my sister? Nothing. That's not what I heard. I mean, that's not the word on the street. She's... She's all broken up over you. Don't know why. She left me. Dumped. A case of the crabs will do that to a woman. Is there something about this team I need to know? What I want to know is what an asshole like you did to my little sister to make her leave. She's 28, all right? And trust me, she's not so little. Trust you? Ooh, no, you didn't. How's your last partner doing? Gamble. He trust you too? Hey, you want to talk about this now? You're going to tell me about it? Street, Street, Street, Street. Hey, Street! You want to talk about it? Come here, come here. Don't talk about what you don't... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Street! It's not worth it. Who else you going to narc on? Who are you? Who the hell are you? I guess you're not the prettiest one here anymore, huh, T.J.? Well, sounds like you've all gotten acquainted. Let's get started. I'll make this simple. LAPD SWAT is the most honored, most respected, and most professional police division in the world. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! * You jump in front of my car when you * You know all the time that * Ninety miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive * You tell me it's all right * You don't mind a little pain Police! Police! * Take you for a drive * I'm not the only soul * Who's accused of hit and run That ain't going to get it. * I can see you had your fun * But, darlin', can't you see * My signals turn from green to red Bang. Sanchez. * You're just like * Crosstown traffic * So hard to get through to you * Crosstown traffic * I don't need to run over you * Crosstown traffic * All you do is slow me down * And I got better things on the other side of town Money. * Yeah, yeah Crosstown traffic * Oh, oh, man. Ooh! That sucked. What's up, Sanchez? When you're done with that one, I've got another one for you. T.J.'s sitting on two pair, looking for the boat. Got it. Street, you've got three aces. Need one to take T.J. out. Winner, winner, winner! All right, Deke. Let's see what you've got. 10 of spades. Spade flush. Not good enough. Hondo, isn't that a straight flush? Hold the phone. Six, seven, eight, nine, 10 of spades! Straight flush. Deke! Beats four aces in Compton any day. I think it works in Orange County too. Sure you're right. Good work, guys. Police! Police! Clear? Clear. Clear. Let's go. That's right. SWAT is a life-saving organization, not a life-taking one. That's why the FBI and Secret Service come here to train with us. Smooth, Deke. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I guess if I was deaf, I wouldn't know you were here, but while you're laughing, there's lots of people that want us to fail. Get it right. Clear. Clear. Clear. Suspect, put your hands on your head and come out. Come out! Come out! Come out now! Turn around. Down! Down, get down. Down. Yeah. Outstanding, guys. Huh? Huh? You feel that? The team's going out for beers later. I'm buying. I'll take mine after we pass. Well, Fuller's definitely going to try and hose us. Good. I'd hate to break a sweat just for a first-round knockout. Hey, we've got a big day tomorrow. Save some. I've got plenty. I'm depending on you to get these guys through this. I'll cover my end. Can I ask you something? Yeah, go for it. Why'd you pick me? To piss off the captain. All right, here's the scenario. There are six hijackers armed with handguns and knives in control of that plane. They've already killed one hostage and are threatening to kill the others unless they get a pilot and fuel within the hour. There'll be SWAT officers disguised as hostages. Other SWAT officers will be playing the roles of terrorists, and they will be trying to kill you. Staff sergeants will be grading us. Couldn't give us the bus, huh, Hondo? They always give us the goddamn bus. It sounds like Fuller's really got it in for us. You think? Another thing. There are two dynamic entry points. One here beneath the front landing gear, one back here by the baggage compartment. I'm sure Fuller's got surprises at both those entrances. We get bogged down anywhere, we fail. Any ideas? There's another way in, Hondo. There's an elevator shaft here where they bring in the service carts, and there's a mechanic's access right here. Man, that's going to be tight as hell. Yeah. How many men can we fit in there? Men? None. All right. Work this out. Get in there and break Fuller's heart. Okay. What do we got? Toy guns. Toy guns, sir, toy guns. Let's do this. All right. Shame you're not playing one of the terrorists. I'm supposed to be in first class. We've got camera three going up? Three is set. Checked it on the monitor. Are you ready? Oh, yeah. Okay, let's see what they've got. Ready on three. * Gather 'round * Love, baby, yeah * Gather 'round, come on * Love, baby, yeah * Listen up, we got a lot to learn * Yeah * Number one Time is running out * Number two Time is running out * Number three Time is running out * Number four Let it all hang out * Check it out * Stay cool * Stay fly * Yeah * Number one Time is running out * Number two Time is running out * Number three Time is running out * Number four Time is running out * How did you know about this place? I've known a few stewardesses. Just a few? Stand by. We've got a device. Same here. Disarmed. Set? Here we go. Three, two, one. Boxer, one down. Down! Damn. Deke? I got one down. McCabe? I got one. Sanchez, one down. That's five. There's one more, guys. There's a sleeper. Come on. Come on. That'll be six. Clear? Clear. Clear. Clear. 10-David, this is 70-David. We are Code 4, all clear. Oh, yeah. Wow. Is that a new course record? Yeah. All right. Good job, guys. Damn. Please, please, Pop. Yo, Sanchez. I'm in SWAT now. Yo, Deke. Deke, is that you, man? Oh, my God, Deke. Tell me that ain't you. You were a serious butterball, bro. That's all in the past. I ate here every day, worked here every summer. I ended up looking like Fat Albert. I'm cool. Eating right has me looking like this. Man, put that away. Hey, put that away. Put another in for me. Hey, yeah, break out your money. Give me that change. Ooh, whoa-oh, hey. Ah, so you're celebrating without me, huh? Mr. Kaye, you are the master. Like son, like father, right, Dad? That was one kick-ass display today. That's what I'm talking about. All right, but let's remember one thing. If that was a real operation and not a test, one of us would be calling T.J.'s family, trying to explain what went wrong today. One casualty may be acceptable by department standards, never acceptable by mine. We're clear on that? Got you. Yes, sir. Crystal. All right. Well, let's continue celebrating tonight, but tomorrow, we're SWAT. Nice. I love you too. Homeland security, my ass. They can't keep me like this. I've been patient, day after day, so tell me, what's going on? This is the problem. Your prints do not match your ID, so they're running another check right now through the FBI and Interpol. Interpol, shit. Get me out of here. I'm doing everything I can. Do more. This is easy. Who do we have to pay? You can't solve this problem by throwing money at it. Then who do we have to kill? Come on, guys, it's only 11:00. I got a babysitter for the first time in three months. We've been up since 4:00. That's weak. If I get home by midnight, I might get me some. T.J.? I get home before midnight, I'm finding some. Sorry, babe. Boxer? Hey, I know I'm not getting some. If I don't get home soon, my wife's gonna freak. You guys suck. You know how hard it is to find a babysitter? Yo, Street. Did you pass? Yeah. Awesome. This first round's on the house. Thanks, darling. Anything but tequila, please. No? No. We did good today, huh? Yeah. What's it like, the real thing? It's faster. It's a lot faster. You know that guy? Used to. Aw, fuck. Bye. See you. It's all yours, man. Hey. How you doing? Oh, man, I am good. Heard they took you back. Yeah. This your girlfriend? No. No, she's SWAT. She wha... She's... What... This... This is what it's come down to? Busting down doors with J.Lo? You know, I didn't know that they made bulletproof bras. Is it just me, but you know, I didn't know that. What they need to make are bulletproof condoms big enough to fit your big head. Oh. Oh, nice. Good, I like it. This your girlfriend? Cute. No, but you can be my bitch. Really? No, man, leave it alone. Here we go. Leave it alone. Hey, how are you? I'm good. Put it on my tab? Mmm-hmm. Hey, glad to see all that butt-kissing's really paid off. Say hi to Fuller for me. What? You should've let me kick his ass. I just saved yours. So you and this guy Gamble were partners, huh? So how long you got the babysitter for? Just because I bought you a drink doesn't mean you get laid tonight. So what does two drinks mean? Do you want to come over to my house? That was easy. It's my kid's birthday party tomorrow. Tomorrow? Uh, kids, birthday parties... I'm hosting a Tupperware party tomorrow. You, Tupperware? Yeah, seals in the freshness. Party's completely booked, otherwise I'd invite you. Tomorrow, noon. Central, open South Sally port. All right, gentlemen, take a seat. You may have won the battle, but you lost the war! Dad, can I have some of this? Yeah, go ahead, get it. Can I have this too? Whatever you want. Get it, get it, get it, get it. Look at that. A cop who drinks French champagne, huh? That is just impressive. I may work in the mud, but I certainly like to play up in the clouds. I thought you said you'd fix the sink. This is Lieutenant Harrelson, Olympic SWAT commander. This is top priority. Patch me through to all black-and-whites in the area... I've got to go. Kids, come on, come on. It's time to ruin Mommy's day. Okay. But you killed in the soccer game. Baby, I have to go play cops and robbers. Okay. Okay. I love you. You too. Hey, guys. The reason we are gathered on our God-given much-needed day of rest is we have a Polish hostage. So what if he's Polish? No, no, no. Means he's one of those "Anybody comes in, I'll blow my head off" type of guy. Negotiations aren't going well. They think he's off his meds. We've been lobbing gas, and this guy's still smoking cigarettes, popping off shotgun rounds out the front door. I want a limo, a 12-pack, and clove cigarettes! I say we go in the back, hard, with shields. Negative. Guy says he has all the doors and windows wired with high explosives. Come on, Greg. Look, Dan, you wrote the book. I just read it. Any suggestions? I've got an idea. Ready? It's the damn robot aliens. Down! Down! Get down! Down! Get down! Down! Put your hands behind your back. Stay down. You know what? I think he might be Polish. Unbelievable. Like opening a can of sardines. It works. Drop Fruit of the Loomski in the A-car. Damn, man. You need to be selling that shit on eBay. I only got one. Split the profits 50-50. Corner the market. Break them down like a shotgun. "The Polish Penetrator." Hold on, sports fans. I just got a call from Sheriff's. It seems we've been holding a high-priority international and didn't even know it. They want us as escorts? You're my new favorite crew. Just get the prisoner to the headquarters. This is 9-Tom King, transporting inmates to Superior. We've got a black-and-white signaling pullover. Roger that. What's your 10-20? Hollywood and Wilcox. 9-Tom King, stand by while we identify the black-and-white. Roger. 9-Tom King, there is a problem with one of your transports. The unit signaling is probably providing interception. Can you read his patrol number? Negative. It's an LAPD black-and-white. Stand by while we confirm. 9-Tom King, this is 70-David. What's your location? 9-Tom King, do you copy? What about me, boss? Let's go. Get these off. 9-Tom King, there is a problem. 9-Tom King, do you copy? There it is, on the right. 9-Tom King, do you copy? This is 70-David. We're Code 6 with the bus at Hollywood and Wilcox. 114, this is 70-David. We're Code 4. 114, this is 70-David. We're Code 6 at Hollywood and Wilcox. Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Out of the car! Get out of the car! Get out of the car! Get out of the car! Down! Down! Get out of the car! HONDO: Put your hands on your head! Freeze! Put your hands on your head! Hands up! Hollywood, huh? On the ground. On the ground! Hey! Do not move! Do not move! Move again. Drama in Hollywood today. An explosive and deadly day in Hollywood as a gun battle erupted between armed suspects and members of LAPD's elite SWAT unit. Details are still sketchy, but sources tell us there were fatalities, including two Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies. At approximately 1:45 p.m. today, a Sheriff's Department bus was assaulted by two suspects armed with AK-47s in an attempt to break out a jailed detainee. We are awaiting the arrival of Alex Montel, the international fugitive wanted in over a dozen countries. Montel is wanted on Interpol warrants by more than 10 national governments, including our own, in relationship to charges of arms dealing, drug trafficking, extortion, smuggling, kidnapping, and over two dozen murders. Domestic and foreign law enforcement agencies are already jockeying to interrogate the man one high-level White House aide has dubbed simply "The Catch." I will give $100 million to whoever gets me out of here! Let's go. $100 million! The family's legitimate business throughout Europe and the Middle East are rumored to be fronts for their criminal activity throughout the world. The family fortune is estimated to be in the high hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars. I will give $100 million to whoever gets me out of here! 100 million sound good to me. Hell, yeah. Are we hot? We rolling? We have limited footage of the dramatic events this afternoon. $100 million to whoever gets me out of here. The family's fortune is estimated in the billions of dollars. An offer of $100 million... Who does this guy think he is, huh? $100 million... Hey, ese, are you for real or what, homes? Huh? Hey, I'm talking to you, ese. We've been looking for this punk a long time. Busted taillight brings him down? That's amazing. The plan is to have you escort him to a federal prison out in the desert. You may want to have press photographers meet us at the facility, soon as my boys hand him over. It's a hell of a story, huh? Yeah, we'll pass that request up the ladder to D.C. Good. Gentlemen, at 1300 hours, an LAPD helicopter will arrive to transport the defendant. Until we get him inside a federal facility, he's our baby. Sergeant Howard, your team's got the high ground. Yes, sir. Sergeant Hondo, your boys are going to provide close-proximity protection for the prisoner. Copy that. Sergeant Yamoto, you're going to set up a perimeter around Parker Center. I'm on it. Piece of cake. Roger, 10-David. We're coming out. Okay, guys, let's get this frog in the bird. What's $100 million six ways, Box? Sixteen-something. Man, I'd have floor seats at the Lakers, put my kids through college, hire Halle Berry as my yoga instructor. Match engine power. RPMs match. Gear down now. Cover! We've been hit! We've been hit! Shots fired. Shots fired. Anybody see where it came from? They hit second engine. We are going down. Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! We're going down! Down! Everybody okay? Yeah. T.J., Sanchez, take the suspect. Move! Move! Let's go! Let's go! 70-David to 114. We're coming in. Come here. Hey, hey, hey! Jim! Jim! Street! Keep it together, buddy. Keep it together. Keep it together. Street! Knock it off. We don't have time for your personal shit. Move him out. Let's move! Let's go. Move! You tell them we're under goddamn attack! An LAPD airship is down. How do you want us to proceed at this point? What the hell happened? Somebody shot our bird down. No shit. How? My guess is big-bore rifle, probably .50 caliber. Somebody who knows how to use it. We're at a whole new level here, Captain. So where the hell is the shooter, huh? I want this asshole out of here, now. The best bet's to keep him on lockdown till we figure out who we're dealing with, sir. Captain Fuller? Yes? I've got the chief of police on the phone for you. So now we're talking about my ass. You draw up a plan, you execute it, and do not screw this up. Have it transferred to my office. Can't believe how much grief that frog's $100 million offer's bringing us. You guys ready? You know what you've got to do? Uh-huh. Yes, sir. Where's T.J.? I'm right here, Hondo. Sorry, man. Had some bad Thai food last night. It's not sitting well with me. So you good to go, or what? No, I'm good now. Let's go make the captain look like a hero. Be safe out there. I'm headed to the bird. All right, we're moving out. Let's load them up! Time to go. Put that on. Marry me! Marry me! Marry me! Hey! Come on! Hey, come on, now. Get out of the damn street! Wait there. Come on, now! Alex, let's go! Get down! Get down now! Get on the ground! Move! I don't know, talk to them. Try to make it work. Look, I've had enough problems for one day, you know? Hey, where's Mike? Family emergency. Just let me know if there's anything you need. All right. Just try to get us there alive, for starters. My sister's dating some new guy. Yeah? Yeah. I met him for the first time the other night. Good for her. Not really. He's kind of a knucklehead. You should give her a call. You know, if you want. All right, yeah. Maybe I will. 10-David to 70-David. Word our motorcade has been hit. Any damage? Terry Fargas is dead. Aw, damn. We've got two patrol officers on the table at County. What's your location, 10-David? Right on top of you. That's good to know. Yeah. T.J., stay alert back there. They're coming out of the woodwork. American greed. Shut up. So reliable. Shut up! Another officer's dead because you shot your mouth off. That's how I like cops. Dead. Want to join him? Huh? He knew the dangers, no? That's why he signed up to be a police officer. Carry a gun in the Wild West. Like you, cowboy. Would you be sitting here if this job wasn't dangerous? Anyway, killing him probably got you 20 new recruits. You should thank me. Yeah, you're right. I should. Boxer, thank him for me, will you? Love to. We are coming up on Checkpoint One. Roger, Hondo. I see it. Making the turn at Checkpoint One. Hardcore, Sanchez. I'm watching everyone's hands. Empty hand, no weapon, I'm going home to my little girl, Deke. I'm going home to my brats too. We are now approaching Checkpoint Two. T.J., relax, man. Hondo transported the President like this back in '96. No one had a clue. Hey, my friends. I can double my offer. 66 million for each of you. All you have to do is let me go right here, and don't worry. I'll find my way home. You got the cash? Because we don't take a check. Come on. Be smart about this. What do you make? 66,000 a year? Not even with overtime. Loser. Making the turn at Checkpoint Two. My view of Car Two has been blocked. T.J., what's happening? I got a pedestrian in the crosswalk, Hondo. I'll be on your tail in about 10 seconds. Roger that. Hands where I can see them, guys. Come on. T.J., what the hell are you doing? What the hell does it look like I'm doing? I'm taking Frenchie here up on his offer. Now, you guys just be smart. Hands up, Box. Come on. Come on, hands up. Hands up, Box. Let's go. Let me see it. Hands up! Let's go! What the hell was that? What the hell was that, Brian? He was going for his piece. No, he wasn't! I had it under control! You didn't have to shoot him! What do you say, Jimbo? Want to be a cowboy? T.J., Street, Boxer. Car Two, respond. We're catching up to you, Sarge. We'll be there in about... Officer down! Seventh and Hope! Flip a bitch. Flipping a bitch. 10-David. Move! 10-David! Do you have a location on car number two? Move! Move! Move! Roger. Car Two is stopped at Seventh and Hope. Do me a favor. Tell Fuller it was me who pulled this off, yeah? I'm not going to let you get away with this, Gamble. Well, you ain't got a say in the matter, do you? Suspects appear to be wearing tactical clothing and have automatic weapons. T.J., don't do this! I got an officer down! Officer down! Seventh and Hope! Suspects are entering the Pershing Square MTA station. Boxer! Boxer, hang in there! Hang in there. You okay? STREET: I'm all right. Boxer got hit. We're going to need an ambulance! Who did this? It was Gamble. Box! Get him up. Get him over! It was T.J. and Gamble. They've gone down the subway. Let's go hunting. I'm going to get the kit. Take care of him. Yeah. Street, let's go! This is 73-David. I need an RA unit as soon as possible to the corner of Hope and Seventh. Officer down! I repeat, officer down! All right, T. We're in. Let's go. Hit the juice, Grandpa. Come on, Box. Come on, come on, come on! What do we got? Gunshot wound to the neck. Vitals? None. Come on! Let's go! Oh... Oh... Always one step behind. This is 70-David at Seventh and Hope. Suspects are on eastbound train number 507, headed to Metro Center at 7th and Figueroa. Have the rail unit contact MTA and shut down that train at the next station. Roger that, 70-David. What are they gonna do, take the subway all the way to Mexico? Come on, check for secondary wounds. Sanchez... Deke, Sanchez. Meet that train at the next station. 73-David, we copy. You'd better be good for it. I assure you, if anyone is, it's me. I want you to set up a perimeter. Nobody comes in the station and nobody gets off a train. Yes, sir. You got it. Rail unit, this is 10-David. I've got my men headed to the Figueroa station. Now, are you ready to stop that train? Yes, sir. Where the hell's this train? Never made it. Should've been here by now. Sanchez to Hondo. The train never made it to Figueroa. Secure the station. SWAT's got it. Got people. Hands up! Let me see your hands! Now! Hands. Hands! Hands. Show me your hands. Hands. Where are they? They said they were going to kill me. They're not coming back. Down the shaft. Where'd they go? 10-David, this is 70-David. Suspects have entered what appears to be a storm drain approximately a quarter-mile north of Metro Center. Roger that, 70-David. We'll deploy above ground accordingly. We're going in after them. This shaft intersects with the storm drain system. They could pop out of any manhole within a five-mile radius. How many manholes are we talking about? Six thousand. Six thousand? I can't cover 6,000... R-Commander, 10-David. I want you to put that airship down and give me a command post at Sixth and Hope Street, and give me a landline, Code 2. 70-David to 10-David. 70-David to 10-David. 70-David to 114. Do you read me? 70-David to 114. Do you read me? We got no reception down here. Gamble wants us on an island... He's got it. Stay alert, guys. They went this way. We have ID'd those suspects. Great. Who are they? Former Officer Gamble and Officer T.J. McCabe. Gamble? As in Street's ex-partner, Gamble? Roger. Whoa, whoa, whoa. There is some kind of plan here, right? There's your plan, Pumpkin. We have got two SWAT-trained guys leading this attack. How do we know the rest of the team isn't in on it? Because I can vouch for Hondo. You willing to bet $100 million on that? Bingo. You've got to be shitting me. If they're good, this is only going to slow them down, T.J. This was supposed to be simple snatch and extract. Boxer was a threat, T.J. Boxer was my friend! He was mine too. Stop crying. You can buy new friends. Don't give me any more reason to kill you. What are you going to do, shoot me? You should relax a little bit, my friend. I'm the money here. Don't forget it. We don't have time for this shit. Look, you can go ahead. I know this sucks. Let's worry about it in paradise, all right? Come on. Have we re-established communication with Hondo's team? Not yet, sir. 70-David, advice your location, please. 70-David, come in. Hondo, where the hell are you? Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's that? It's phosphorescent paint. Oh, yeah? Keep your eyes on the wall for more. Gas masks? It's just smoke. We're going to have to go in blind. What's going on? Tripwire. Live mine. Whoa. Claymore. Nasty stuff. No shit. There's an old Indian saying. "Where there's one white man..." "There's more white men." What? Do you hear something? No. That's the problem. Come on, we've got to move. Hey, y'all smell like shit. Yeah, that'd be a sewer. Where's our air? On track and on schedule. Wonderful. T.J., ride with me. Come on, guys! Got to go! All units in the vicinity of the Hawthorne Airport... Residents report beacon lights turned on after closing hours. Dispatch, this is R-Commander. Deploy all available units to Hawthorne Airport. Call the FAA for details. They're going to fly him out of the country, God damn it. 10-David, this is R-Commander. Get you and your men over there as soon as possible. Roger that. Unit One, what's your status? We are approximately 45 miles due east of Point Bravo. We have begun our descent. That's a six-minute ETA. Roger that. Ain't this a bitch? A cold, hard one. 10-David to R-Commander. We are approaching Hawthorne Airport. Street! How about the Claymore? Shit. I'll be back. Deke! 10-David to R-Commander. We have established a perimeter around the airport. Additional SWAT units are en route. Van One, Van Two, you have less than five minutes. Roger that, 10-David. Any word from Hondo's team yet? 70-David is still out of radio contact. Hondo, you son of a bitch. You sure you know what you're doing? Remember when you asked me what I used to do in the SEALs? Oh, yeah. All right, clear. Fire in the hole. 10-David, this is 70-David. 70-David, where the hell are you? We are somewhere around Sixth and Trenton. We lost communication in the tunnels. Where's our backup? Everything I have is going to Hawthorne Airport. That's where your friends, Gamble and T.J. McCabe are headed. That's the other side of town! Send a couple units to pick us up. Pick you up? For all I know, you're in on this. I've got a good mind to bring you in. Like hell. Come on, let's go. Police! Stop the car! Stop the car! Stop the car! Stop the car! Stop the car! Exit the car, sir! You guys are gonna have to get out of here. Police emergency. We need your vehicle. Wait, I just have kids in the car. Well, get them out of there! Look like it's you and me in the gun cage this time tomorrow. You know how it is, Street. Sometimes doing the right thing ain't doing the right thing. Last car through. Bridge is locked. Copy that. I thought you couldn't drive. I never said I couldn't drive. I said I didn't like to. Keep getting into accidents. Sounds like they're trying to fly him out of here. Yeah. Why would they turn on the landing lights and warn everybody? Shit! Gamble's smarter than that. Look, there's a full moon out tonight. Even a rookie pilot could land on a night like this. So why'd they pop up back there? I don't know, but I know Fuller's sending every man we got to Hawthorne. Did they build a new airport in downtown in the past couple of days? I don't think so, Sanchez. Why? That jet to your right. It's flying pretty low, and it's only getting lower. That's our boy! That's our boy! He's setting down. Yeah, but where? I don't know, but follow that jet. How wide is the Sixth Street Bridge? It's got to be four lanes across, sidewalks... Plane small enough, he might be able to set it down, if he's got the balls. Reducing speed. This is 70-David. That plane's not coming to Hawthorne. I gave you a direct order to stand down, Sergeant. And I would have, Tom, except I saw a Learjet about to land on the Sixth Street Bridge. Give me 40% flaps. 40% flaps. Check. Sir, we have reports of a low-flying aircraft in the downtown area. Where's the nearest backup? Five, six minutes. I don't think you're feeling me on this, Tom. We're going in. Oh... Oh, God. Reverse thrust. COPILOT: Roger that. Full brake. This guy's worth every penny. All right, let's turn this plane around. 10-David, we just got a report a plane has landed on the Sixth Street Bridge. They what? Let's mount up! All right, give me a car downstairs, now. What... What... What's going on? Just got room for one of you. I'm not going anywhere without my wife. Well, then, don't. No, no, no. Richard! Richard! Richard... Richard is gone, so sit down and shut up. 20 seconds! See you in Margaritaville. Come on, come on, come on! Won't you just let me go? Please, just let me go! Shut her up. Please, let me go! Shut the hell up. Get us in the air. Yes, sir. Okay, let's go home. Oh, look. They've got their own airport security. You've got company! Limo broke containment! All right, we've got you covered, man. Just keep coming. Boom. Son of a bitch! Here. What's this? Well, that'd be a cell phone. That's the account number where I want the money transferred. The bank verifies the transfer, goddamn, if you ain't a free man. 70-David, be advised there are hostages on board. All right, you heard the man. Deke! Yo! They get that plane off the ground, those hostages are dead. I need your A-game, boys... And girl. What's going on? Get them off our asses! Just fly the plane. Open the hatch. Open the hatch! I'm on it! Hang on, guys. Here's where watching The World's Most Exciting Police Chases pays off. I got no shot! Get this thing in the air! Shut the door! Shut that goddamn door! Damn it! I hope you've got a plan B, brother. You stay there. You're fine. Gamble! Let her go! Take a shot, Jimbo! Sanchez is down! Sanchez... Go get him. Give me more ammo! Deke! Frog's running! Are you okay? I'm all right, man. Sorry, ma'am. I've got to go, too. No. Tell Daddy how you want it. Ahhh! You're like a goddamn rash. You might wanna get that looked at, brother. How's Boxer? What do you care? Come on, Hondo. Just give me that. He's going to make it. Good. Just couldn't resist, could you? So what do you want to do? God damn it, Sarge. There's one in the chamber, partner. Come on. So how's Boxer? Got word he's going to pull through. That's great. Remind me to buy some shares in Kevlar. Good work, Sanchez. You look like you need a Band-Aid. Somebody else needs a body bag downstairs. You okay? Yeah. You? Nice job. Don't sound so happy. Still got a problem. He's still here. Road trip? Road trip. Yeah. Road trip. Guess you'll have to fire us later. We're here to transfer custody of LA Police Department prisoner number 109672 into federal custody. Thank you, sir. I will accept the transfer. Enjoy your new home. Try your best to get to know the guys, huh? Yeah, 100 mil ought to buy you a nice husband in there. Where to, boys? Oh... Home sounds like a winner. Girls like you get guys like me in trouble. You think I should've taken the 100 million? All units, we have a 211 in progress at the Diamond Mart, 43, South Hope Street. Shots fired. Technically, our watch has been over for 12 hours. So? Yeah. Well, what the hell.
