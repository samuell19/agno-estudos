JUAN ANTONIO SAMARANCH: And the winner is... The... the winner is Sydney. (CHEERING) RICHARD MORECROFT: Australia will have the honour of carrying the Olympic torch into the new millennium. QUENTIN DEMPSTER: Winning the right to host the Olympics almost caused Sydney to spontaneously combust. You know to think that we can hack it in the big... in the big swim. (BRASS BAND MUSIC) (CHEERING) CROWD: Sydney! Promises are already being made to deliver the 2000 Games in spectacular fashion. Have you measured the 100 metres track? It's about 100 metres. It's about 100 metres long. REPORTER: The stadium is the biggest ever built for the Olympic Games. Is the 200 metres track ABOUT 200 metres long? That is the most impressive stadium I have seen in my life. REPORTER: The Australian people want an apology for the injustices of the past. We have a particular place in this country. We've been here since time immemorial... (ECHOES) ..immemorial. Happy New Year! REPORTER: Bus lanes have appeared... REPORTER: Never before has Australia been the focus of so much attention. REPORTER: The Olympics has really arrived here. The event you're about to see they're calling "The Race of Our Lives". Cathy Freeman in the 400... (ECHOES) ..400. (CHEERING) CATHY FREEMAN: My running has allowed me to walk in a light, to be in a light, to live in a light, that comes from within. And it's carried me to these places that I never thought imaginable. (CHEERING, WHISTLING AND APPLAUSE) When I think about that one night in September, for me, it takes me back to my very first race. Like, I remember the first time I ever raced. It almost felt like my feet never touched the ground. My body just seems to physically be able to do it with great ease. And I felt like I was flying, even as a five-year-old kid. That's where I found true peace. And that's where I felt, so completely free and so completely happy. It's a beautiful feeling. It's almost like falling into a slipstream that leads you straight to heaven. For me, it was always just such a... ..dare I say, a spiritual experience, to be frank. 'Cause running absolutely and will always be my first greatest love. It's like the very first kiss you take, with someone, the first moment you realise, "Oh, my God, I'm completely gone here." You know that feeling? (LAUGHS) And people see it or they feel it. It's like a chemistry, you know? It's like when you can't take your eyes off someone, for some reason. There's something about them. (STARTER'S GUN FIRES) Just the way she ran, I just felt, "Here is a champion." (CHEERING) "And we've got to help her." Some people just move beautifully. And she did, just those long strides. It was like she glided around. There was elegance, there was... it was just a glide. WOMAN: She just looks like she's floating. You can't take your eyes off her. MAN: I could help a thousand other people and they couldn't do what Cathy Freeman could do. 'Cause she's got the magic, she's a genius. Her beautiful, flowing, free, fluid style, it's like a beautiful machine that's well-oiled. PAUL KENNEDY: Everything's just so smooth and so natural, and there's seemingly no effort. That's how Cathy ran. And just watching her has been a joy. (CHEERING) CATHY FREEMAN: People still light up when they talk about that night in September. They sparkle. And we're talking about something that happened so long ago. Because the lovely thing about this particular story is that a lot of people were involved in it. I was very fortunate in that I was born into a very tight-knit family. I'm one of five children. But my mother's one of 11. I adored my mother. Hard-working, dedicated to her children. Very independent. At times, very stubborn and very proud. My mother and my dad divorced when I was around about five years of age. Roughly three years later, she met my stepfather, Bruce William Barber, affectionately known as 'Blue Eyes'. REPORTER: What do you think was the big break? Bruce had a lot to do with that. If he hadn't have come along at the time that he did, I don't think that I could've had the resources to do it on my own. BRUCE: I didn't know anything about athletics. But I thought, "Well, if nothing else, I could teach her to get fit." It was my stepdad who encouraged me to put up on the wall, "I am the world's greatest athlete." The fact that my older sister, Anne-Marie, she had severe cerebral palsy... ..just sitting and being with her absolutely defined who I am, as a person. She passed away in 1990. But, gee-whiz, I tell you, the lessons she taught me, will never leave me. Things around respect and not judging a book by its bloody cover. She says that she ran for her sister. That's what drove her to succeed in what she did. Keep on your toe. Keep on your toe. Drive your knee. Drive your knee higher. The knees goes higher all the time. REPORTER: Her first professional coach was Mike Danila, a Romanian defector who couldn't believe his luck in finding such untapped talent in Australia. I felt myself go down a bit. But the one before was better. Yeah. She looks like without any limit. Being epic is allowing yourself to be tamed. You have to do what your coach tells you, you have to do what your doctor tells you, your physio tells you, your masseuse tells you. Eight hours of rest, enough water, no alcohol, no heels, no standing around for long time. Untamed is being that champion that you see yourself being. In the mind of a track-and-field athlete, the pinnacle is an Olympic gold medal. The moon comes up every four years. The thirst to get an Olympic gold medal is unquenchable. REPORTER: At 16, Catherine Freeman is ambitious, dedicated and very fast. The exuberant Queenslander, the youngest member of the track-and-field team, is impatient for her first taste of international competition. PETER FORTUNE: She was a shock entry into the 1990 Commonwealth Games. Australia saw her burst into the limelight. That was my first time I actually saw her run. REPORTER: The first black Australian athlete to win gold at the Commonwealth Games. She was determined. She had determination. That's all she wanted to do was to run. PETER FORTUNE: She was a very relaxed person most of the time, and when she did switch it on, incredible competitiveness. Yeah, as much as I've ever seen. The young Australian of the Year for 1990 is Catherine Freeman. (APPLAUSE) There are a lot of Aboriginals and Islanders who have so much talent. Because of the colour of their skin, I think they've got this inferiority complex which holds them back from doing what they can do. (CHILDREN CHATTER) REPORTER: The little kids love her. Black or white, they accept Cathy Freeman for who she is and what she's done. BOY: Thank you. GIRL: Thank you. REPORTER: What did it mean to Aboriginal kids, to see Cathy named as Young Australian of the Year? I think it meant an awful lot. I think this will make them stand up and say, "Look if she can do it, I can." I was a kid who was quite embarrassed to be a black kid, an Indigenous kid. I sort of grew up with that self-image. Like, I still remember, I could never understand why, whenever I smiled at someone, they wouldn't smile back! (LAUGHS) I used to get really upset. I thought, "Why don't people smile back at me?" (LAUGHS) It just used to, quietly, really devastate me. I was about 10 or something and I had won my race, but I didn't get the trophy for it, apparently because I was black. We absolutely felt like we weren't on equal footing with other people. But... when I ran, it just changed. It was like everything was different in the world of running for me. COMMENTATOR: She's off scratch. She's got 42 metres to make up on Debbie Tomsett. And here she is. She just loved the racing. So, she'd go and run at club meet. The State titles, she'd run. She'd go the Stawell Gift, which is our professional racing on grass. A lot of people wouldn't even know what that is. (WHISTLE BLOWS, STARTER'S GUN FIRES) COMMENTATOR: Cathy Freeman. She's virtually got a quarter of the race to make up. Can the crowd get Cathy Freeman up from there? About 200 metres from home, they're shaking their heads, but here she comes. Now the crowd realise she IS a chance. Cathy's passed the first of them, she goes past Tomsett. Lewis gives her a shove. Cathy Freeman, now is going to catch Shanie Coutts. She grits hard! Cathy Freeman! She does it! Freeman by half a metre! CATHY FREEMAN; I know that I not only represent myself, but I represent my people, and I know my people follow me. I have my people there to support me, financially, emotionally. It's very important to me that my people are with me all the way. This next lady is simply sensational. The new Aussie golden girl of the track they call Catherine the Great. But you don't feel the pressure of being, A, a woman, B, a young woman, and, C, an Aboriginal woman? That's not too much pressure? No, I'm having fun. ANNOUNCER: Years of training behind her, focused for this one moment. (STARTER'S GUN FIRES) They're away. Freeman off to a good start from lane 3. REPORTER: The odds were on Nigerian 100 metres champion Mary Onyali, but Freeman didn't disappoint, powering from behind to cement her hero status. Through now, it's Onyali in front. Can Cathy pick her up? Onyali's pretty strong with 50 metres to go, Cathy's coming at her! She's flying home, Freeman! And she gets up for gold for Australia! (CHEERING) REPORTER: The first woman to win both the 200 and 400 metres in the Commonwealth Games. Then, in defiance of team chief Arthur Tunstall, she combined the Aboriginal and Australian flags. She should've carried the Australian flag first up, and not seen the Aboriginal flag at all. We've all come together, under the Australian flag. It's the Australian flag that flies every time we win a gold medal. I think it is improper to associate the Aboriginal flag with the Australian flag. With all due respect I don't care. I'm here to run and that's all I'm gonna do. REPORTER: So, no regrets Cathy? No, no, regrets. I wanted to shout, "Look at me, look at my skin. "I'm black, and I'm the best. "There is no more shame." REPORTER: Across Australia, it seemed there was overwhelming support for the athlete. She's proud to be an Aboriginal and that's wonderful. Yeah. I think that's great. Well, why not? She's an Aborigine. It's the first one to win a gold medal. I don't think she meant anything against the Australian people and the flag. The Aboriginal community needs to, uh, have heroes like that. Here was a young Aboriginal woman, not that different in age to me, proudly being both an Aboriginal woman and an Australian. And it made me feel really positive and good about myself as well as about changing that narrative of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and how they are seen in the Australian psyche. Did you ever dream it would cause such reaction? No, no, no, never. It's just natural for me just to have picked up the Aboriginal flag because it represents my people. Like there's this mural in Melbourne with traditional Aboriginal people with chains around their necks, you know, being treated like animals and I draw strength from those sorts of... paintings, which is pretty much what the flag represents. You know, all the struggles, I suppose, and hardships that my people have had to deal with. I've always been very mindful of my ancestors. There's two parts of Queensland where my Indigenous ancestors are from, maternal and paternal. And then there's English, Chinese and Syrian ancestors. I identify as being Indigenous. To be Indigenous is to feel truly connected to the land we're on, in theory and in essence, like, in spirit. Yeah, Indigenous is special, it's unique, because Indigenous obviously means that you are of the land. I think there's a lot of white Australians who have grown up not understanding what had gone on with the Aboriginal people. MAN: We will always... will have our doubters in Australia, with, you know the stuff that happened. I believe she has certainly changed the minds of a lot of non-Indigenous people. When I think about all the injustices and innocent people whose lives were changed forever, it makes me really sad. But it also makes me really determined. SCOTT GULLAN: No doubt people heard her background and what her family went through and then it's like, "OK, so that happened, the Stolen Generation. "I didn't know enough about that. Now I do." CHILDREN: (SING) ♪ For we are young and free... ♪ SCOTT GULLAN: Because of this amazing person who'd gone through so much to get to the top of the world. (ENERGETIC MUSIC) CATHY FREEMAN: The great Marie-Jo Perec, she was the sort of woman who struck fear in the hearts of most athletes. You know, people would see her walk into a room and people would just freak out. They would just freeze with fear. She's just a magnificent athlete. She was so statuesque and so striking. Her muscle definition was incredible. Her running style, her legs, just the way she competed was extraordinary. ANNOUNCER: Olympic champion, Marie-Jose Perec. SCOTT GULLAN: Perec was the tall, intimidating... ..oozed champion, and she knew it. And she tried to get in Cathy's head many times. And I think she did for a little while. Cathy thought, "I'm the bridesmaid." I was always just so desperate to just win against her. PETER FORTUNE: The '95 World Champs was the one where she... ..went out too hard, trying to beat Perec. COMMENTATOR: Perec's got the lead, Freeman second, holding onto second. Miles is coming home well, Cathy is fading, may miss a medal. Perec's going to win brilliantly. PETER FORTUNE: She ran the wrong race and she blew up and got very tired. COMMENTATOR: fourth Freeman, and the time... PETER FORTUNE: She resolved that lapse would not happen again. It was always her in the front of my mind and at the front of my heart that made me do the things I did, training the way I did, aspiring the way I did... (LAUGHING) ..and dreaming the way I did. And Marie-Jo Perec, she ran 48.86. So, I decided, "Well, if I'm going to be any good, "you have to try and... you have to look towards beating the best." So, I wrote down, um, on a piece of paper, in big large letters, "48.6." (CHEERING) ANNOUNCER: In lane 4, representing Australia, the Commonwealth Games 200 and 400 metres champion, Cathy Freeman. (CHEERING) The 1992 Olympic gold medallist, Marie-Jose Perec. (CHEERING) (STARTER'S GUN FIRES) BRUCE McAVANEY: Cathy OK, Perec up very quickly, as you'd expect. Cathy's running well. Perec tries to get to her. Perec goes up alongside of her. Freeman grits her teeth. Perec leads into the straight. Can Freeman lift? She is lifting. She goes up to Perec. Perec's a half a stride in front. Freeman's coming at her! Perec now holds her. It's been a mighty race... (ECHOES) Perec was challenged that night in a way that she hadn't been challenged for a while and Cathy brought the best out in her, and she brought the best out in Cathy. It was the fastest time either of them ever ran in their career. It was a masterpiece, to be truthful. Perec wins and Freeman gets second. REPORTER: Freeman's run nearly one second faster than her personal best, her effort forcing French runner Marie-Jose Perec to an Olympic record and the first to win back-to-back gold in the event's history. RAY MARTIN: Now to Atlanta and Cathy Freeman, her best run ever, by more than a second. Good enough to beat any woman in the world, except for one. Now you told us, in February last year, that you'd have to run 48.6 to win the gold. You did that but it wasn't quite enough. Yeah, just for a split moment, I thought to myself, "I can win this." And... and unfortunately, I just... ..a big bear jumped on my back, but I'm just so happy because I pushed her to her very best. Was she beatable, Cathy? I think she is. I mean, I just... I don't know, I just think... I just need a little bit more time and... it'll happen. There was always a part of me, that ran towards her, 'cause I knew that she was the only person who could ever unlock my own potential. The place in which I started from, people just weren't big dreamers. People just didn't have even a vision of a possibility of what they could become. She gave me permission to get really bold with my goals. Atlanta silver medallist Cathy Freeman is still celebrating after breaking her drought against world and Olympic 400-metre champion Marie-Jo Perec at a track-and-field Grand Prix meet in Belgium. The Australian turned the tables on her arch-rival, after once again breaking 50 seconds. PETER FORTUNE: That was significant. It showed that Perec's beatable, gave Catherine a lot of confidence that she could match it with Perec. BRUCE McAVANEY: Cathy went through this four-year period where she was basically unbeaten. It's quite remarkable. SCOTT GULLAN: She won the world title from lane 1, and that just never happens. COMMENTATOR: She's just in front, the Aussie. I think she's got them! Yes, she's done it! That was a massive moment. COMMENTATOR: Cathy Freeman, the first Australian woman ever to win a gold medal at the world championships. I have enormous pleasure in announcing that the Australian of the Year is Cathy Freeman. PETER FORTUNE: I think she was probably the most recognisable figure in Australia at the time. More people knew her than would have known the Prime Minister. I came out of an Australia that really had negative views about Aboriginal people and Cathy smashed every single one of those negative stereotypes. U.S. REPORTER: Now you're the world champion, it's a different set of pressure you had in the past. What do you feel like, going into this season, and, of course, ending up in Sydney? Oh, you know I'm optimistic and, I'm looking forward to the future with a lot of... zest. It was just being teed up perfectly for Cathy to go to Sydney in 2000, and I've never known anything like it, in terms of the build-up and the expectation for one race, starting literally two years before. We've come down here to see Cathy Freeman today because she gives us hope. Somebody's up there, like one of us. COMMENTATOR: She's created history, the first woman ever to win back-to-back world championships over 400 metres. It's so difficult I think to have that long, long winning run, but not have the one thing that you want more than anything else. She still had the challenge of signing the deal, so to speak, 'cause what people would have said then was, "There you go - "she could win everything for four years "but she couldn't win the one that mattered most." (SPEAKS FRENCH) MAN: I was working for the British Ministry of Defence, designing future clothing systems for the army. I was offered this job at Nike to join this advanced clothing team. The brief for my first project was to help someone run faster. We came up with the idea that we would put different textures on different parts of the body. Texture equals speed in aerodynamics. Air is like a liquid and, so, if we can reduce the drag of your body as you're moving through this liquid, then, potentially, it could maximise an athlete's velocity. MAN: One of the critical elements of any Swift Suit is to try to get the seams orientated either with the airflow, or completely out of the airflow. EDDY HARBER: We had really just gone after performance. It wasn't a fashion-design project. It looked so... nuts. And I can remember, we sort of came away kind of going, "Who the hell's gonna wear that?" You know? (LAUGHS) EDDY HARBER: We made a full white suit, which was kind of a stealth secret suit that we sent down to Melbourne. Like, the zip, the actual... thing, it's sitting right on my... MAN: Your windpipe? Yeah. Yep. EDDY HARBER: Really, with Cathy, it was about getting it so that she was comfortable in the suit. The main difference between Cathy and other runners, that we noticed, was she has very long legs in proportion to her torso. It took us a good six months to get the fit totally done. The one thing I do have to try and get used to is having... ..the wind blow past my ears. I can hear it. I can hear... MAN: Good or bad? Uh... Well, you feel like you're slicing through the air, it's good. Yep. EDDY HARBER: When she said, "I feel like I'm slicing through the air," that was, like, bingo! That's exactly what we needed it to feel like. REPORTER: Cathy Freeman, who has helped in suit development testing, is yet to decide whether she'll wear one at the Olympics, or stick with the conventional look. I knew that the Sydney Olympic Games were going to demand of me a temperament that I'd probably never really drawn on before. Because the pressure and the meaning was just so incredible. Few sports stars have captivated Australia the way sprinter Cathy Freeman has. Cathy Freeman... Cathy Freeman... Cathy Freeman... Cathy Freeman... Cathy Freeman... Cathy Freeman... Cathy Freeman... Cathy Freeman... Cathy Freeman... Cathy Freeman... (ECHOES) It's like looking through a window, and what's on the other side of that glass, you can see the beast. (HOWLING) And that's the media and that's the noise and they're the voices and it's all the excitement and the pressure from others, the density of it all. I consider them beasts because they can either eat you alive or if you give it respect and acknowledge it, then you can actually get on quite well with it. For me to have sustained my own performance and focus, I had to kind of, in a sense, have peace with that beast. You know, when you can't change things, it's best to just be at peace with it, I believe, and so that you can move through it and just experience real freedom. CROWD: (SHOUT) Five, four, three, two, one... COMMENTATOR: So, the Olympics has really arrived here. ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Sydney 2000 Games of the 27th Olympiad. (THEME FROM 'THE MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER' PLAYS) So, I get to the Olympic opening ceremony. I sat next to Cathy's mum and then we're thinking, "Oh, I wonder who's gonna light the torch." And then, all of a sudden, Cathy's mum looked down and said, "Is that Catherine?" (CHOIR SINGS) ANNOUNCER: Cathy Freeman. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) RICHARD MORECROFT: For the first time, Australia has recognised the legal existence of Aborigines prior to white settlement. We have a particular place in this country. We've been here since time immemorial. PAUL KEATING: We committed the murders. We took the children from their mothers. NEWSREADER: Federal Cabinet decided last month to officially recognise the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags. WOMAN: We have a great people's movement out there who want to see reconciliation. REPORTER: 100,000 hands, 100,000 signatures of support. REPORTER: Many thousands of people have embraced National Sorry Day. That's the support that we have on the ground for reconciliation. That's the people sending a message. WOMAN: By 2001, we have to achieve something on paper to say that we are the Indigenous people of Australia. (CHEERING) When Cathy lit the flame, she was standing up there on behalf of all of us. She was the perfect person. I can't imagine any First Nation's person around the world didn't feel pride at that moment. She's a symbol of what we can be as a nation. All I was scared of was her getting burnt. (LAUGHS) That's silly I know that's silly. Then I realised what a big deal that was, you know, for her to be chosen to actually light the flame. I was so proud of her, that they chose her. CATHY FREEMAN: I'm really proud to be a Kuku Yalanji woman - to have a place in the history of this country. You know, surely, in a sporting context but in a social justice context, you know, matters that are so important for the future of this country. That's the most inspiring part for me. (CHEERING) The Olympic stars continue to arrive. Today, the woman who could stand in the way of Cathy Freeman, Marie-Jose Perec. Guys... Yeah, keep walking. Yeah, we were there, cameras were there, in her face. It would've felt like a war zone. You're coming into enemy territory. She was enemy number one. REPORTER: You're running... What's your problem? SCOTT GULLAN: For us, for the media, it was all about, "What's Cathy doing? Anything she did was news. Had breakfast - where? We needed to know where she was every minute of the day. I have to admit the attention... is always really overwhelming. I'm just really, really determined to have a good time. I don't want this to be a stress... I don't want this to be stressful. (CHUCKLES) And, uh... (LAUGHTER) Meanwhile, yeah. Cathy Freeman's arch-rival, Marie-Jo Perec, has again avoided questions. Refusing a request today by French team officials to attend a news conference. Yeah, I hope that you guys have been treating her nicely and, um, with... with all her... the respect that she's due. SCOTT GULLAN: No, we didn't do anything more than normal. It was just more... that was the sentiment. We did not want her to win. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) (CLATTERING) The biggest shock of the games so far. French woman, Marie-Jose Perec... ..has fled the Olympics under dramatic circumstances. For I can confirm that she has departed Sydney, that she is, right now, not in Sydney. REPORTER: I spotted them on the off-chance. I started filming them on a little Handycam. After I got my shot and thought that was enough, her fiance walked back and threatened me and said, "Stop filming." Do you want me to film you...? I'm sorry. MAN: Listen to me! Do you understand?! Yeah. You come near me again and I will hurt you. Do you understand? He king-hit me in the back of the head as I headed for, um, the safety of a chocolate shop. NEWSREADER: The International Olympic Committee was caught by surprise. I don't know where she is. She's not in my office, though. (LAUGHTER) NEWSREADER: Perec claims a man found his way to her apartment and verbally abused her. But the account is disputed by the management of the apartments. And what do you think about the motivation for this because, as you said, she hasn't run for so long. I... I think she realised she couldn't beat Cathy Freeman. I don't see any other explanation, you know? Maybe she's a little bit parano... paranoid, you say? She read the signs. She knew, "I'm at my most vulnerable right now. "She is at her absolute peak. "Do you want to go out that way, "losing to your heir apparent? "Nah. Keep my legend and my mystique and disappear." My heart dropped. My heart drops still, now. I knew that I was up for it. She knew it and I knew it, but we'll never know... (LAUGHS) ..because it didn't happen. That race will never happen. (BROADCAST THEME MUSIC PLAYS) BROADCASTER: Good morning, it's Monday September the 25th... BROADCASTER 2: Monday, September the 25th. And guess who makes most front pages? Our Cathy. BROADCASTER 3: A determined Cathy Freeman. BROADCASTER 4: Tonight's the night Freeman runs... BROADCASTER 5: for gold tonight in the Olympic... BROADCASTER 6: final of the 400 metres. That morning, you know I thought, "Wow, this is a different day." I had a dry mouth, I felt nervous. It's amazing how one person can stop a nation. And that's exactly what Cathy Freeman will do tonight here at Olympic Stadium. Tonight's a big night for her, big night for track and field and, I guess, a big night for the media. REPORTER: Before 23 television cameras and several hundred journalists. REPORTER 2: Cathy 400 metres. A television audience numbering in the billions... (ECHOES) ..the billions... the billions... I felt a responsibility that we were winding up the pressure. You just look at that small frame. That's a lot of weight to be carrying. I couldn't remember any other moment in sporting history, and I cannot think of any other athlete that has been placed under so much pressure. There was lots of things that were happening in the lead-up to the 2000 Games. You had nearly a quarter of a million Australians who walked across the Sydney Harbour Bridge in support of reconciliation and, at the time, the Government's refusal to say sorry to the Stolen Generations. And I felt like that all came to a head through that one race. Run for yourself Cathy. You've, uh... You don't have to carry anyone's burden. I felt exceptionally light. I felt exceptionally loose. I felt good. It's just another day at the office, remember? You can see the stadium lights, you can hear everybody. And the sound of 120,000 people, it sounds like a beast. (CROWD ROARS NEARBY) The vibrations are just incredible. And you can sense this is an Olympic finals night. You can absolutely just even taste it in the air. REPORTER: Fans poured into the Olympic precinct from early this afternoon. WOMAN: I remember getting on the train with my Aboriginal flag. WOMAN 2: I was a volunteer. WOMAN 3: I was five years old. MAN: And we listened to it on the car radio. MAN 2: I was in Hughenden. MAN 3: I was high up, the home straight. WOMAN 4: We were sitting at the 100-metre start. And it just dawned on me then, watching all those people and what they expected her to do. So, what are the odds, now, of Australia's favourite runner achieving her dream? But for the other athletes, it was very noticeable that it was Cathy's to lose. This is a real opportunity here. You couldn't be in sport and... ..not understand the gravity of missing your moment. And the event you're about to see, they're calling "The Race of Our Lives". Cathy Freeman in the 400, with more than 110,000 in the stands and just about every television set in Australia tuned in. When we come back, the women's 400-metre final from Sydney. (FANFARE PLAYS AND FADES) I'm now completely on my own. It's a moment of... complete vulnerability. (LAUGHS) This is what I've been preparing for my whole life. There's electricity at the very ends of my fingertips. And there's electricity all up to the top of my head. It runs down my neck, down my back, it's all the way down to the very tips of my toes. The, uh, official is quiet. We're now being led to the stadium, under the road, and, uh, we're walking in silence. This is my step towards the future now. I still feel a very overwhelming sense of tranquillity. And I'm feeling calm, I'm feeling OK. You can hear the spectacle. (MUFFLED CROWD NOISES) You can hear the voice booming over the loudspeakers and... (MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ON LOUDSPEAKERS) ..and we're all still being held together in this bubble of silence. And the clock is ticking down. (TICKING ECHOES) I have a distinct moment where I'm about to turn the corner, to go out onto the track. And I remember somebody saying... MAN: (SHOUTS) You can do it, Cathy! As soon as I hear this person, everything becomes like a blur. And people seem to fade away. And I know that people are going to see me. (CROWD ROARS) (SILENCE) It becomes otherworldly. You can almost hear your own heartbeat, it's the strangest feeling. (CROWD ROARS) BRUCE McAVANEY: The women are out for the 400 metres final. RAELENE BOYLE: The whole nation has been waiting for this. I don't hear anyone. I just sense that... I'm all alone, actually. We had a race plan worked out, which I'd written on a little bit of paper. She said, "Now, just... let me just sit here. I just want to... "I want you to go through that race plan again. CATHY FREEMAN: "Fast start for 50 metres, no longer." Otherwise you bring in other energy systems which you don't want to bring in quite then. "Move from very fast to fast relaxed, to the 200-metre mark." So, still running quickly, but not hardly. "Pick up on bend a little to make sure of my position." The bend is slower than the straight, so you've got to pick it up or the pace will just slowly drop off. "And then go hard from about 120 to go, "and hold form to finish line." It's pretty simple really. It was aimed at winning the gold medal. It wasn't aimed at running the fastest time. Could be a difference. I make sure I'm back at the start block. And, of course, I show to the world the famous Nike Swift Suit. She wore the... the suit. It just upped the stakes massively. PETER FORTUNE: It was a very gutsy move, because if you don't win the race, you know, you come out with this radical outfit and people'll be bagging it forever. This is what a rock star must feel like, and the rock star that night was Cathy. Our race was right after her race and you're supposed to stay in the call room under the stadium until they call you out. We just walked out of the call room to go watch that race, all eight of us, because it was just that special. And you thought, "Wow." She was making a statement. She was getting ready to do it in style. It was... all or nothing. "Here I am." (CHEERING) WOMAN: Come on, Cathy! I instinctively take some deep breaths in and out, looking up to the sky. It's so I don't feel suffocated by... this moment. And I'll breathe to the heavens as if to say, "Help me!" (LAUGHS) STADIUM ANNOUNCER: ..the women's 400-metre final. In lane 1, Olga Kotlyarova. (APPLAUSE) In lane 2, Donna Fraser. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) In lane 3, Katharine Merry. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) In lane 4, Lorraine Graham. (APPLAUSE) In lane 5, Ana Guevara. (APPLAUSE) In lane 7, Heide Seyerling. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) In lane 8, Falilat Ogunkoya. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) In lane 6, Cathy Freeman. (CROWD ROARS) (MUFFLED ROARING ECHOES) There is people watching in the stadium. But all I can see is my lane. (CHEERING GROWS LOUDER) STADIUM ANNOUNCER: That brings us to the women's 400-metre final. Just as the race was about to begin, you know, started hushing, hush-hush, literally just so quiet. You could almost hear a pin drop. However many hundred-thousand people holding their breath. PAUL KENNEDY: I was just preparing myself for the fact that she wouldn't win. PETER FORTUNE: "Probably won't happen." You know, "Something'll happen. Australians don't win gold medals." MARIANTHE SITZOUKIS: What if she did lose? What could I possibly say to her? There was still that little nagging feeling in the back of my mind that was like, "If I'm not really careful here, "I could become over-emotional "and I'll blast it out too hard and lose it." U.S. COMMENTATOR: Cathy has waited for this moment since '96. Australia has waited since '64. Their Aboriginal people have waited... forever. MAN: On your marks... I can feel the texture of the Tartan track under my fingernails, I can feel the pressure on my fingers. And I go down onto my blocks. I'm feeling good, I'm feeling quiet, I'm feeling silent, I'm feeling strong. Quiet. MAN: Set. (STARTER'S GUN FIRES) (CHANTING IN INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE) BRUCE McAVANEY: Freeman out well. A mighty roar. So, I'm out of the blocks, over the first 30 metres and it's a case of doing exactly what I know I need to do. I'm feeling sharp. I'm not having a lot of contact on the ground, my body is feeling amazing. We move towards the 200-metre mark. I'm cruising, I'm feeling light, I'm feeling fantastic. PETER FORTUNE: And she was literally jogging down the back straight. She was so effortless. I can feel the sun shine out of my chest. (INDIGENOUS CHANTING CONTINUES) The movement, the sprinting, and just that sense of flight. Nothing else matters in those moments. You know, they call it time but it just feels like a whole series of just being in the moment. It's like sheer bliss. With 150 metres to go, we're all looking like we're all placing the same. It's more of a sensory exchange. The way people make you feel is the first cue. At that point in the race, if someone believes that they can win, someone's being assertive, it's all about what you see, how they're running, how they're competing. It's as clear as daylight. MARIANTHE SITZOUKIS: And just as she's turned that corner and we can see that she's not winning, she's coming third... BRUCE McAVANEY: This is where Cathy exploded in Atlanta. Graham's in front of her. Freeman's got work to do here. ..I'm just thinking, "Oh, my God." SCOTT GULLAN: Oh, hang on. Is there something wrong? MAN: My heart just sank. I just went, "Oh, no. PAUL KENNEDY: "Oh, no, she's behind. "Someone's going to run a race that's out of this world." CECELIA BARBER: I could remember taking a big, deep breath. SCOTT GULLAN: I had two scripts ready to go 'cause we were on deadline. One - Cathy wins, one - Cathy loses. Heartbreaking writing it. "Oh, my God she's lost. "Australian hearts are breaking," you know? "Cathy Freeman unfor..." MARIANTHE SITZOUKIS: It was a split second of dread, and it just was like a car crash. And I think that's when everyone where we were was just willing... like, just, like, "Come on!" MAN: Come on! Get going! SCOTT GULLAN: Go, go, go, please, please do it, please do it. (CHEERING) (INDIGENOUS CHANT CONTINUES) CATHY FREEMAN: 120 metres to go. Nobody's making a move. I'm waiting. I'm waiting for that challenge. Lorraine looks like she's actually in the lead, I can feel that she doesn't think that she can win this race, not this one, not tonight. This is my moment, 80 metres to go. (CHANTING STOPS) (HIGH PITCHED WHISTLING) I feel like I'm being protected. (WOMEN CHANT IN INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE) My ancestors were the first people to walk on this land. It's a really powerful force. Those other girls were always going to have to come up against, you know, my ancestors. (WOMEN CONTINUE CHANTING) (HIGH-PITCHED WHISTLING) For the first time, I feel the stadium, I feel the people, I feel their energy, I feel like I'm being carried. (CROWD ROARS) And I know exactly what I need to do. I know how to do this, I can do this in my sleep. I can win this, I will win this. Who's going to stop me? I go, I go and I go. BRUCE McAVANEY: nearly in sight! Cathy lifting! Goes up to Graham, takes the lead! I actually feel like someone has put me on a cloud and I can't even touch the ground. I don't even feel my feet touch the ground. This is a feeling I've never experienced before. MARIANTHE SITZOUKIS: It felt supernatural. It was just like this, "Whoosh!" PAUL KENNEDY: It was almost like watching someone fly. She was flying. PETER FORTUNE: It was very possibly the fastest last 100 in a women's four ever. COMMENTATOR: Here they come to the line! Cathy Freeman, by a big margin, for Australia! (CROWD ROARS) (CROWD NOISE STOPS) And the moment I'm airborne across the line, I think to myself, for the first time, so this is what it feels like to be an Olympic champion. (CROWD ROARS) BRUCE McAVANEY: What a legend. What a champion. (CROWD ROARS) All of a sudden, I'm in a stadium filled with 119,000 people. I can't even hear a thing, except just this incredible, dense, thick, impenetrable energy and noise that is almost too much to bear. (CROWD NOISE STOPS) It's like that window shattered. That beast from outside came crashing through, into my sacred space. The beast is a complex mechanism. (LAUGHS) So, there's a lot of colours going on, inside and outside. We all carry some sort of anger or fury or sadness and pain. PAUL KENNEDY: Everyone across Australia was in their own state of ecstasy. There was a lot of cheering going on. And only after a little while, once we've calmed down and stopped hugging each other, did we look at Cathy again. It's only looking back that you think, "Oh, what was she thinking? "What was happening to her at that stage?" I just was completely... floored or something. Everybody was just so... at one together. It's like we were the only people who existed in the world. So, I sit down... (LAUGHS) ..take my shoes off, so I could feel that bit of stability and groundedness. COMMENTATOR: (SHOUTS) Take a look at Cathy Freeman's stride pattern! She's striding away from the other women like they're standing still! An incredible run! SCOTT GULLAN: She knew it was the pinnacle of her career, and I think, as part of that, she figured, "This is the biggest race of my life. "I'll run the fastest time of my life. "I'll break 49 again, I'll go 48, potentially personal best." I looked straight across to the clock and I was disappointed with the time. PETER FORTUNE: The first thing she said to me was, "Oh, Fort, "the time, a bit slow? The gold medal was almost... ..right at that moment, it was almost a secondary thing. It's just beginning, it's just beginning, I've got a long way to go. So, I just intend to go on further and further and further, until I reach my potential. Until I reach my limit. I should have run under 49 and I didn't. And I knew that I had a lot more in me. I'm an Olympic champion but there's this feeling of not feeling completely satisfied. It's like an itch that's always there. STADIUM ANNOUNCER: Cathy Freeman of Australia... BRUCE McAVANEY: Events that are measured in time, at such an exact time, there's all the other things that go with it. It's the burden of favouritism. It's the burden of lighting the cauldron. It's the burden of a nation willing and wanting. It's the burden of four years of basically being unbeaten. I think it's her greatest performance. (CHEERING) MAN: She won, it was brilliant. WOMAN: Just so joyous for everybody. MARIANTHE SITZOUKIS: What was sown on the inside of every child is priceless. I wanted to be her because I wanted to succeed like her. I want to be like her. I want to be like her on the track. I want to be like her off the track. BRUCE McAVANEY: It's what great art and great sport does. It inspires, it raises your sights, it gives you something to look up to, and that's what Cathy did. And she's... 20 years on, it's just as powerful as it was. CECELIA BARBER: Everything changed that day. SCOTT GULLAN: She brought the place together. MARIANTHE SITZOUKIS: I feel like I won the race. I felt like I ran the race. MAN: Everybody was a winner. MAN 2: Black and white Australia stood as one. EDDY HARBER: It was just bedlam in that place. MARLEE SILVA: I still feel the power of it. PAUL KENNEDY: Was it for nothing? Did we not learn anything? KATHARINE MERRY: It was just absolutely magical. MICHAEL SIMONS: Nelson Mandela coming out jail. EDDY HARBER: Jessie Owen running in Berlin. MICHAEL SIMON: Cathy Freeman winning the 400 metres. PAUL KENNEDY: That was a gift. She gave us all a gift. CATHY FREEMAN: It just feels... (EXHALES) ..feels like a dream.
