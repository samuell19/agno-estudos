THE MAGNIFICENT ADVENTURER Hey! Look over there. Let's go. Explain. What's your brother up to now? - Nothing. - What have you been doing? We just borrowed a little gold and some stuff. - At this hour? For a loan or love, any hour's a good one. You'll wake up my aunt! - Oh no, that'd be all we need! What do you think you're doing? Where have you been? Will one of you tell me? Calm down, Gemita. We're working for the sake of art. But all these things, where did you find them? Benvenuto… - Let me work, will you? You've stolen this, haven't you? What do you mean? We'll explain later. Hey! What do you think you're doing? Trying to turn my house into another studio? Now, now, Angela, don't make me lose time, please! And why did you let them in? - They didn't ask. They just walked in. Angela, you've got to help us. It's very important. Don't get me mixed up in this. If you let me work here, Angela, I'll win the prize.. And you'll be my muse. - Who's she? One of your wenches? No, my love. I mean, you'll be my inspiration and I'll win the prize the Grand Duke of Florence is offering. It'll be my wedding present. Wedding? Oh, Benvenuto, finally! Well… - Where are you going? I've got to go tell my aunt that she lost her wager. What kind of wager? She had a bet with my brother that you would never marry me. But why, your brother thought that I… - Oh, certainly! He's always been sure of it. Your brother's an optimist. Are you eating your words? - Never. And speaking of eating, don't you have anything ready? Francesco is hungry and he's too afraid to ask. I'll go right now to prepare something for you. You'll see! What a wonderful foundry and beautiful workshop my aunt will give you, after we're married. Yes, afterward. But this is madness, your Highness. Sheer folly. His eminence, the archbishop, is right, your Highness. As your doctor and if may say so, as your personal friend, I share his concern. But should Romans, according to the writings of Tacitus… The ancient Romans were noted for their vigorous constitutions. Where will we all end, at this rate? All of Florence will become a nest of pagans and unbelievers! At least don't take off your underpants. - It would be advisable. And less sinful above all! Well, we can possibly agree to that. Anyhow, I've decided to follow this experiment to the very end. My lords, I am going to take a bath. I've never felt anything quite like it. No, no, no, no. I feel a certain diffusion of extremely light heat and a sensation of wetness over all of my limbs. Yes, yes, I should say it's decidedly pleasant. Ahh, scratch me there, you. Oh, what a wonderful feeling! This is progress, surely. I am certain that people will like baths, even once a year eventually. Forgive them, Lord, for they know not what they do. Now, let's see the new works of art. Engraved silver cup, work of Bacio Bandinelli. My head, no! Let's not overdo it. "Neptune and Tethys", work of Benvenuto Cellini. Gilt cast in gold. Where'd he ever get the gold? - I don't know. That's my amethyst! That's my gold! You thief! You rotten thief. Fraud! - Watch what you say! He's the one who entered my house and stole everything! - Silence! Thief! - Hold him. You'll repent this! What's your opinion, Michelangelo? I'd say…, that Benvenuto Cellini is a very dishonest young man, while all the other contestants are very honest. However, Benvenuto Cellini has more talent than all the others put together. Benvenuto Cellini, I condemn you to pay back everything you have taken from him. This shouldn't be too difficult for you, since you are going to receive amounts to 1,000 florins in gold. But it's mine! - Release him. Thank you, my lord. Please forgive me. My next work will be dedicated to you and to our city. Perseus, holding the head of Medusa. Make sure it's always covered. Else it will crack and if it does crack, I'll crack your head, understand? Someone's knocking. I'll go open up. I'm talking to you! - I know. You understand what I told you? Sure, sure, that it's always got to be covered, just like a little child. Don't forget, it's a child of Cellini. Benvenuto, are you trying to kill yourself? You haven't eaten in three days. Why did you let him in here? I don't need to eat and I don't need your brotherly concern. Now get out! Can I see? Marvelous! It's the most beautiful thing you've ever done. Wait till you see it full size, in bronze. Then you'll see something. Ah, I'll bet Angela sent this. She knows how much I love roast chicken, especially the legs. Now see here, that's my chicken. I cooked it with my own hands. Angela's in bed today. So she's waiting for me, huh? Uh, I'm afraid you're mistaken. She's poisoned herself. Why? - What do you mean, why? You deserted her and nobody's seen you since. Oh, one thing or another, you know? I deserted her for that. Yes, but look, she's gone and written a letter in which she says she's poisoned herself because of you, and if they find that letter, we'll have all of Florence on our backs. Listen to me, go to her. Tell her whatever you want. Tell her you'll marry her. Anything you think of. But make her give you back that letter. Hey, did you hear me? Did you hear what I said? Oh, what can I do with him? Monster! Murderer! Well, I better be going. Benvenuto! Water! Water! Angela, why? No! No! I have waited so long for you, always in front of our little chapel. And then when I finally realized that you would never be there, I felt a great pain, a great void. And then, I decided…, I'd be better off dead. Three pounds of root she swallowed. Three pounds! Then she only has indigestion. - Shut up! Doctor, doctor, she's nearly dead! - No, Angela, don't leave me! Excuse me. - Maestro! Maestro. - What is it? What do you want? They set fire to your workshop and your brother's inside, Master Francesco. Benvenuto! Benvenuto, I'll be waiting for you tomorrow at the church! And if you're not there, I'll murder you! Hurry, bring more water! - What happened? Master Francesco's up there, in the fire! Francesco! Francesco! Francesco! Francesco? What happened? They broke into the workshop, then someone hit me on the head. It was… It was Bandinelli. Take them this food. A moment. Well now, my friends, all drink to the end of unfair competition. And we'll do just that, Master Tobia and I don't know what I wouldn't give right now to be with our good friend, Master Benvenuto Cellini, in order to be able to console him during this terrible moment in which those grandiose ambitions of his have gone up in smoke! I'm gonna murder you for the filthy treacherous beasts you are! There he is, capture him! He's not the one you should arrest! It's the others! Are you crazy? Benvenuto, let's go! Quick, let's get out of here! Benvenuto, look here. Why, it's just what I was dreaming about. Think how good it will smell when we roast it. Feel how nice and fat it is. Look. - Get down! Hey, Benvenuto, are they looking for us? Nah, it's only a hunting party. Calm down. Well? Give him the honors that he deserves. Bring that pheasant to me. I shot it. Is that so? But he died in my arms. Francesco, go ahead and start cleaning it. But, do you think we ought to? - Francesco, do as you're told. Excellency, I'll have this country oaf dropped. That will teach him a lesson. Come here, you men! -No. Don't disturb yourself. I'll teach him personally not to be impudent to the Constable of Bourbon. I'll give him a taste of my swordsmanship. Not bad for style, but what you need is practice. Your Majesty. Your Majesty, I'm Benvenuto Cellini, sculptor and goldsmith. If you handle your chisel like your sword, you should be worth your weight in gold. I'd be happy to demonstrate, Sire. Right at this moment, it's the war that takes our attention. However…, wait. Count, this man wields a fine sword. Perhaps he could reinforce your escort. Where were you bound for? Looking for a patron, sire, and maybe improve my luck. I would say that you've found your patron. And as for good luck, it is you who must seize it. Count Frangipani, ambassador to his Holiness, needs an escort to return to Rome. You can go with him. - To Rome? To Rome, Monsieur Benvenuto, if you wish to serve me. Ride on. Luciano. Are you quite sure that all my manuscripts are packed in the trunk? Yes, monsieur. - Very well. Very good. Frangipani's quite an authority on history. It seems so. - Just think, I almost didn't come on this trip. Since when are you interested in history? - As of right now. My lord. I hear your lordship is writing a very important historical work, is that right? And how do you know that? - All of Florence is talking about it. We Florentines are great lovers of ancient Italian history. To tell the truth, I'm writing the history of my family, the origins of which are much older than the history of Italy. One must go back to Aeneas, to the Trojans. I'd like to contradict your lordship on that part. - What's that? I happen to have discovered an ancient manuscript in Florence that proves that Minos, King of Crete, was the first founder of your family. He of the Minotaur fame. - Are you speaking truth? Certainly, my lord. It's true. - Well, well. Regarding the story of Minos, we'll talk about it in Rome. But meanwhile, I am going to show you some very interesting documents as soon as we arrive at the inn tonight. Thank you, thank you. This, my dear Cellini, is the bibliographical index on which all my research is based. The fundamental text is, of course, Strabo, but I should like to show you the most precious "Antequarum Rerum Italicarum." It's an extremely rare piece of work. I've been fortunate enough to be able to borrow a copy, but I haven't been able to purchase it for any price. On the other hand, even I, in the Archbishop of Ravenna's place he who loaned it to me, wouldn't sell it either. When one has such a treasure, one must guard it well. What else in life is more beautiful than good books, eh? Well now, where is that blasted Strabo? And now I should like to read to you some excerpts composed by the poet, Bertoli, on the occasion of the wedding of his Excellency Lord Cinccino Frangipani with… with Anna of Brandenburg. And the wedding of Frangio Frangipani with Elizabeth of Braganza and of various other Frangipani or Frangipaninis. I shall retire. - Retire? I'll show the lady up to her room. The poet Bertoli has explored the archives of all of the most ancient Roman houses. Of Massimo, Orsini, Sorelli, Colonna., And he found, after long research in an old castle located near the Pontine Marshes a document of exceptional importance. Goodness, I'm sleepy. I can't understand how such interesting conversation… Contessa! - Who's there? The most fortunate of mortals, who has seen Venus emerge from the sea. But, we've met before. Sure, and I'm not any contessa or Venus. I'm Piera! A servant in this inn. But you're beautiful. And proud as an Amazon. The show is over. Get out! The one you're looking for is at the end of the hall, in the gentry's room. You know something? I like it better here. So you, uh, carry a weapon too, huh? I use this during the day to beat the beef steaks, but at night, I use it on fresh fellows like you! OK, OK, I'm going. I'm going. - Get out! - I was joking! Out! - Fine! Forget it! You? Go away! Get out! Leave this room at once! You must be mad! Get out, or I'll call somebody! Yes, do that. Have me killed by them. I'd much rather die now than go on suffering like this. I beg of you. I know I'm not even fit to touch the hem of your gown, but I can't stop this heart of mine which keeps repeating your name with each beat it takes. Lucrezia! Lucrezia! Lucrezia! I wouldn't even dare look at you if I knew you were happy. But I know you're not happy. Yes, you're right. It's true. A woman can't be happy without love. And you've no right to reject love and happiness. It's too late. - It's not too late. It is never to late to be happy. No! Don't come any closer. I'll kill myself! What next? We've had enough. Please, don't do that. Help, help! Shut up, wench! Hurry, hurry up! Get moving! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Francesco. Francesco! It's useless. He won't wake up, I've tried. Loafer! But you've been wounded. Sit down. That stuff is like liquid fire! Oh, sit still, otherwise I'll throw it in your face! You're merciless like a… …like a fury, a gorgon. And how I like it! Venus, fury, amazon, gorgon! Can't you ever call me by my right name? Let's be friends, Piera. Good girl. Say, if you like, I'll take you to Rome with me. To Rome with you? Yes, you can keep house for me. All right. I'll go with you. But I'm warning you, I'm bringing my hammer. Oh, don't you trust me? I'll trust you a lot more with my hammer around. Well, we chased those villains out of here. But why is this fellow sleeping so soundly? This wine was drugged. It seems we were the only ones who didn't drink any. Fortunately for us. - Thank heavens for that. Luckily, this was saved. It's the tribute that the King of France is sending to the Pope in testimony of his devotion and his obedience. We are greatly indebted to you, Benvenuto Cellini, and we would like to do something for you. My greatest wish is to serve Your Holiness. Well then, we shall offer you a position which is worthy of your courage and of your clever swordsmanship. We appoint you captain of our Vatican guard. You don't seem too pleased. It's a great honor, Holy Father, but I think I could serve Your Holiness better in other ways. I'm a goldsmith and a sculptor primarily. Very beautiful. We would like all our new money from now on to carry this excellent design. But what should we put on the other side? Why not this Venus, Holy Father? It would serve as a reminder of your holiness's love for classical art. And the head? We must find a head worthy of the statue. If the Countess of Frangipani would consent to sit for me, and her husband permits. Of course. - Good. Very well, but dress her up. Try changing her to Minerva. She was a more serious goddess. This is the quantity of gold needed to coin 20,000 florins. Before melting it down, the clerks here scrupulously check the weight. Here's your key. There's no other except mine. When do you think you'll be able to start coining the new money? As soon as I finish Minerva's head. - I see. The most important members to emerge from the history of the house of Frangipani during the 12th century are: after the famous Cinccino Belovial Frangipani, then Ancino Frangipani. Frangipano Frangipani. Fragipanino Frangipani. The brilliant Frangipanino the second, son of Frangipanino Frangipani. All of them illustrious bishops of the city of Rietti. The last one was coadjutor of Narni and a fierce rival of Censio Savelli for possession of the city of Ripatransone. His brother distinguished himself during the Fifth Crusade for having fought courageously for an entire night barefoot against the guards of the Saladins. In just a moment I'll go get the history of the life of Saint Cecilia Frangipani. Oh, I wish you would, my lord. She's a saint I've never succeeded in finding a complete biography of. Ah, it's a pleasure, my dear Cellini. I'll find it right away. Oh no, I beg you, don't torture me. But it is you who are torturing me. Please, your husband is leaving Rome next week. I'll wait for you at my house every night. - Oh, pity! Have pity on me. I love you, Lucrezia. I love you. Tell me you'll come. No, I won't promise. But don't think I feel nothing for you. Well then, Tuesday. - No. - Yes, Tuesday. - No, not Tuesday, no. When? When? Saturday next. I found it! I found it. I knew it wasn't possible I'd misplaced it. Please. As you see, it's a princely house and costs only 12,000 florins. Yes, it might do. But where are we going to find 12,000 florins? Don't worry, I'll manage. What matters is that Lucrezia must find me in a house worthy of her. And worthy of her beauty. - And we'll find a prison worthy of us! Well, have you decided, Maestro Cellini? Yes, I think I'll take it. Come back tomorrow for the first payment. My brother will pay. - Very well. He takes care of all the money matters. - Oh, of course, of course. Are you certain that your play is suitable to the present occasion? Certainly, Mr. Cellini. It deals with the timeless struggle between vice and chastity, And chastity always triumphs. Well, couldn't vice triumph just this once? Never. Perhaps you'd like to hear the opening lines now? Chastity! Please. One day a young maiden was hurrying down a quiet wooded lane. And once again, as we have seen, virtue has triumphed. This has given me a bit of an appetite. - Well, I could do with a bite myself. Who is that? Has she arrived? It was sent by the Contessa Frangipani. Damn! Get out. Everybody, get out! Might we not eat a little something before we start? Get out. - But why? Excellency, I don't think I deserve such treatment! Get out of here, before I throw you out! - What, your excellence? Oh, so you didn't hear me, huh? Get out! Out! - I have never been so insulted! All right, everyone out! Let's go! Let's go! We'll not stay another minute in this house! Go on! Damn it! You ought to be ashamed! - What? Shame on you for treating the people who work for you like that! Why do you care or get upset? Will you care to explain? Oh, you don't understand? I'm not some rag that you can throw away once used! I also am working for you and if things go right in this house, it's because of me! Piera, don't give me any trouble. - I suppose you're right. That idiot isn't worth getting mad about. - Shut up or I'll kill you! Go right ahead! Then history will learn how the sculptor killed his servant! But at least your precious contessa will bother to see you when they come to put the noose around your neck! Get out! - But you don't realize… Wait! What are you trying to tell me? What don't I realize? Piera? Piera! Did you read all of this letter? Why don't you go along with the rest of them? But read all of it. Read it. What a fool I've been! She loves me. She loves me! But that's what I've been telling you. - Don't you see? She loves me. Look. "My husband's been appointed ambassador to Florence. We are leaving in a week." "A cruel fate stands between us. I am so unhappy." She loves me! Florence? We must get to Florence. Oh, I have to get the Pope's permission to leave. Why do you want to go back to Florence? Aren't you happy in Rome? I'm more than happy, Holy Father, thanks to your kindness. But, well, there's something I left unfinished waiting for me in Florence. Something? Why don't you just say it? We know your little secret. You're going back to Florence because of a woman, aren't you? Well…I… I'm ashamed, Holy Father. But whatever for? It's an honorable sentiment. You love a woman and wish to go to her. You wish to make her your own, it's only noble. Well, go ahead. You have our blessing. But really, Your Holiness, I don't think… But you don't have to go to Florence. The one you love has come here and told us everything. She told us of her feelings and we are pleased to give our blessing to you. Rise, my child. Here is your Benvenuto. Marry and be happy. Well, goodbye, Francesco. - Where will you go? Who cares, as long as it's away from this city and that shrew. But the Pope will be angry with you. Think it over, Benvenuto. Sooner or later you have to get married. One must also die sooner or later, but there's no need to rush into it. Master Cellini, there's some gentlemen here who wish to talk with you. - Show them in. Are you Benvenuto Cellini? - Yes. And who is he? He's my brother. We're judges of the court of Rome, and we'd like to ask you a few questions concerning some recently coined currency now circulating in his holiness's court. Turn it over. Benvenuto. Wake up, Benvenuto! Go away, let me sleep. - What's the punishment for forging money? Hanging, why? - That's what I thought. Come here. Look over there. Benvenuto Cellini, come with me. Where? You ought to know better than me. Goodbye, Benvenuto. Be brave, brother. I'm ready, Captain. - Let's go. Haul it up! Come along. The Holy Father is waiting for you. Very cheap trick, Sir! You're all the same, you Florentines! But Your Holiness is a Florentine. - I don't count! And don't answer back! Oh, who's talking? - I ought to have you hanged! Yes, Holy Father, but my brother is innocent. - Silence! Get down on your knees. It's certainly true that one misfortune follows another. I'm giving you a chance to redeem yourself. You told me once that you were also an expert in military matters, that is, when you're not forging coins. Is that true? Yes, Your Holiness. - Well, we need your help. Rome is about to be attacked by the mercenaries of Charles the Fifth. But isn't the Emperor catholic and your ally? - Yes, he was. But he wanted me to excommunicate the King of France and I refused to do that. The Constable who commands his troops is advancing on Rome. But wasn't he the French King's commander? Yes, but he betrayed him and went over to the Emperor. And stop asking me so many questions! Anyway, it's quite clear you don't know anything about politics. And I'm beginning to think I don't either. Anyway, what I want to talk to you about is my artillery. The cannons are old, the soldiers mostly recruits, and the mercenaries are only a few hours' march from Rome. You've got to take charge of this situation and organize our defense. Well, what are you waiting for? Haul away! Steady now! They're attacking! They're under the walls! To your cannons, men! Pull up! Ready? - Fire! Fire! Fire! What are you waiting for, you idlers? Fire! - Fire! Come on, faster, faster! Fire, men, fire! Come on, men, fire! Keep it going! Fire! Here, get this man below! You two, leave number 3 and take over for those wounded on number 8! Oh, Piera! I should've known I'd find you here. You never back down. But you were wrong. You should have left Rome while there was still time. There's no telling what the mercenaries will do if they break through. I can guess, but I don't care. I couldn't run away and leave my friends here to die. - Your the only one. I see in times like these, men and women show themselves for who they really are. I wanted to apologize for how I treated you. It is you who must forgive your servant. Am I forgiven? - Why, of course. Betrayed! We've been betrayed! They're killing everyone! The enemy has breached the garrison of Porta Salaria! Cannoneers, hurry! There's no time to lose! Let's go, now! Let me go! Help! Holy Father, pray for us! Offer us your blessing! Thank you, Your Holiness. You may rise. Yes. I believe I can trust you. What can I do, Holy Father? You must take this message of mine to the Emperor Charles the Fifth. I would like to arrange a peace parlay but the Constable of Bourbon hates me. He has sworn to destroy the city before the Emperor can intervene, but the Emperor is still at Tivoli and doesn't know what's happening. Only he has a sure power over the Constable. I'll do what I can, Holy Father, but leaving the castle won't be easy. There's a secret passage that leads as far as the Tiber. As you see, a Pope must even make use of devils like you in order to save his sheep. There is an officer who will be waiting to guide you to the end of the passage. Then, God will be your guide. Will you bless me, Holy Father? Lucrezia… Go away. We can't see each other ever again. I beg you, forget me. God is punishing us because we were about to commit a mortal sin. Look at that. I think you might be exaggerating a little. Surely he could punish us without involving the whole population of the city of Rome. Have you still the courage to joke? Go away. Well, that's exactly why I came to see you. I am going. I'm leaving the castle tonight on a dangerous mission. I wanted to say goodbye. No, it's not true. You're saying it to make me suffer. How can anybody leave the castle? There's a secret passage. But even so, there's only a small chance that I could get through. That's why I wanted to see you for the last time. Benvenuto… Benvenuto! Here's the exit. Good luck to you. Come on, Francesco. These Romans have plenty of gold! They had plenty! - Now it's ours! Beautiful gold! - Gold for me! That's for you, take it. - When do I get mine? -That's for you. Here, that one! All right, now, this one over here! You take this! - Get your hands off that! - Hey, mine! Stop it, both of you! That's enough! You wanna kill each other? Let me go! No! Please, let me go! Move along. You'll enjoy it. Your husband won't know a thing! Don't act so! - We, handsome soldiers! This way, out of the road, yes! Come with us, This way your husband won't be able to say you betrayed him, yes? Move it! - Wouldn't you like to make to love with strong soldiers? Come on, move, move, beautiful lady! No, stop! Better to kill me! Now we play for lady, yes? Come on! Row! They killed our comrades! - They're takin' the girl away! Shoot, shoot! Close the gates. - Close the gates! Close the gates! No one has permission to leave for any reason whatsoever. - Yes, Sir. What's that for? It's carrying the dead, Excellency. Let that stinking cargo go through the gates! Hurry up, open the gates! Wait a moment! Francesco! Go ahead. Leave me, I beg you! Francesco… - Get out of here. Don't wait for me. Fly! And it is precisely our great power that will guarantee peace to all these people. And this is why we are now at war. Not withstanding our filial devotion to the sovereign Pope. We, Charles the Fifth, have no designs on Rome of any nature. The map? - Here, Your Majesty. On this side of the mercenaries under the direct command of the Constable. All the other troops are encamped along the riverbank. His Excellency, the Constable. My lord Constable. We have heard certain reports, alarming ones, from Rome. It seems that the troops of mercenaries under your command have been sacking the city. Sire… They have even taken to stripping sacred places! They tell of atrocities, committed against all the inhabitants, ignoring even age and sex. They're even attacking the clergy! - None of it is true, Sire. Why, Rome would be at peace now if it weren't for the obstinacy of the Pope. I have decided not to occupy Rome, as was our intention. But I must meditate further, at a quiet place away from here. Well? The Pope has given Cellini a message for the Emperor. Fortunately, I was able to get through to warn you. We must stop him at all costs. I gave orders to all the guards to arrest him or to kill him should he try to escape. To search him, and to bring you everything he is carrying. Anyway, there is nothing to worry about, Your Excellency. I am sure that Cellini will never be able to reach the Emperor. No, don't underestimate him, Count. He fooled you once before. I drank the wine in the tavern thinking that would be enough. Who would ever have imagined that that stone cutter all by himself would have been able to prevent our men from taking that gold? We've made up for it with the sacking of Rome and then some. Goodnight, Count. Tell the men to keep a sharp watch. Your Majesty. Your Majesty! Who is it? Who are you? I'm not the Emperor, I'm just his valet. The Emperor? - Gone to Subiaco. - And the Constable? He went to Subiaco to join the Emperor. He left a little while ago by carriage. I'm the father of a family. Don't kill me, don't kill me! Open up! Hey, open up! Help! - Open up! He went that way. Catch him! Look out! Have mercy! No, no, don't kill me. Matins, Brothers, matins! Morning prayers, Brother. What? Who are you? I must speak with the Emperor! - The Emperor? Help! He's crazy! Stop him, stop him! I am ready, Brother. I thought you'd be older. But the Prior assured me that you are the most devout monk in this brotherhood. I wish you to hear my confession, brother. I have put on this sack cloth to help expiate my sins. Help me to obtain the forgiveness of our Lord. It's the Emperor Charles the Fifth, who is asking. And I'll get down on my knees before you. No, it is I who should kneel before you, Sire. I have a letter from the Pope. We're greatly in your debt, my son. If there's anything we can do for you, please just ask. I beg Your Holiness to allow me to return to Florence. There's an unfinished statue there. If that's your wish, you may go, but it pains us that you are leaving. Yet it's a pleasure to see that you have changed. It's a new Cellini that will be returning to Florence, much wiser, both in life and in art. Move along, faster! Hurry up. I'll have your hides if that metal cools! Throw this in! Maestro! I've hunted all over town. There's no more wood! Nevermind, we'll make do with this. Maestro, I don't think there's enough metal. I thought it was almost full, but we're still short. Serafino! Gather all the metal in the house. And be quick about it! - Yes, Sir. You too, hurry! Get out of here! Raise it! Hold it, hold it, that's it! Careful. Careful! That's enough! Serafino, come here! Take over. - Yes, Sir. Master, we need more gold. - And where will we find more gold? Can you use this? I've thought a lot before coming back here. I was afraid to, but I wanted to see you again even if it was for the last time. You can send me away again, if you like.
