The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be - - and that which is done is that which shall be done. There is no new thing under the sun. UNDER THE SUN Can I have a little blanket too? Aren't you going to sleep? Where are you going? Fine, lie on the ?oor. It's a good day. Four boxes. Good hens. Four today, three yesterday... 18 last week... ...plus... We're three ahead! Olof. When are you going to learn to read? Why do I waste my time on you? Quit nagging. I don't have time. I trust you. You have to. I'm just worried that you'll stop trusting me some day. - Mona died yesterday. - She did? Went peacefully in her sleep. She can't complain - she was 87 Eight kids, 21 grandkids. They were all there. - How did she die? - Suffocation. There were 29 people in the room. There was no air. You're talking about Mona...! - I have to go now. - Haven't you forgotten something? - Aren't you going to count it? - I trust you. - Oh, the nice shirt today? - I'm going to town. A woman? Sic him, boy! Go back to America! Sit, boy. Hello, I'd like lo... Hi. Hi there. I... A gift from Olof. Erik... - Whats the seventh commandment? - Are there that many? - Thanks. - I'm going to buy a trotter. - You're going to buy a horse? - You want in on it? - How much? - 400. - How much are you putting down? - A lot more. I'll talk to Alice about it. - What does Karin say about this? I'm hardly going to tell Karin! - Have you got the balls? - Such language! And there's poor old Mona. How's Sven doing? Not too well. - But it wasn't unexpected. - Mona was sick for a long time. But it's always painful when someone passes away. - But it's practical. - What do you mean? What would we do without her? She's our paycheck. I dig the hole, Sting cleans her up, you say something nice. Look! - Keep your hands on the wheel! - He's a little devil. Hello, I'd like to place an ad. Of course. Fill in this form. No, it's better if you do it, so it's done right. Of course. Solitary farmer, 39, own car, seeks young woman as housekeeper. Um... Could you take it again, a little slower? - Again? - Yes. "Solitary farmer"... 39. Own car - a Buick. I think "car" is enough. Seeks woman...young woman... As a housekeeper, that is. OK... "Solitary farmer, 39, own car" - - "seeks young woman as housekeeper." - Yes. - There. Now I just need a signature. What do you say about "All applicants will be considered"? When will she come? Or...l mean... The replies, when can I...? layout come in Friday next week, I think we'll have some replies. - Hello, Olof. - Hello. Well, what words of wisdom do you have today? To every thing there is a season... ...and a time for every purpose under the heaven. - "Under the heaven"? - Under the heaven. Ecclesiastes 3:1. "...Seeks young woman as housekeeper." - Is that correct? - Yes, it's correct. - Is Olof printing that in the paper? - Does the Bible mention discretion? Hello again, Olof. Did you hear that Mona has passed away? Yes, I did. - Can you come to choir rehearsal? - Of course. I'm worried about you. You're a little too isolated at the farm. Hi. We forgot something before. - A photograph. - Oh... Right. "Photograph requested." Erik, you can't park here and make such noise. it's a desecration! Do you want the grave dug or not? - How deep do you want it? - Two meters. - This is two meters. - No. - Have you ever dug one of these? - No, I lead people to their rest... ...two meters underground. But I'm not here to argue about that. Read this. "To every thing there is a season..." No, not that. There - the next column. "Housekeeper wanted. Solitary farmer seeks young woman as housekeeper." Who can that be, Erik? Someone you know. Olof. Sure, and the Yanks have landed on the moon. - They will. - Not before you're in one of these. It is Olof, Erik. He came into the newspaper office when I was there. - Keep it quiet. - You know me - mum's the word. I'm only telling you this because you're his friend. - Where's Olof? He promised to come. - He's always on time. He must have something else on his mind today... There you are. Olof. "Thanksgiving." - Give him the tone, Per. That's fine. Thank you Lord for blessings given Thank you for the gifts you gave - Tenors! - Thanks for all the days we live and - Thank you for this very day - Ladies! Thanks for summer sun and raindrops Thanks for autumn chill and dark - Wonderful! - Thanks for long-forgotten teardrops Thanks for peace within my heart I seem to have forgotten my glasses... Couldn't you read them to me? - It's not my place to do that. - Please do, it's okay. - Really? - Yes. "I'm a young woman from Alingsas. I'm 29 and have worked as a maid." "I can cook and I've always wanted to live on a farm." "I'm on my own, and not very strong, but I promise to do my best." "Sincerely, Anna Persson." - There's no photograph in it. - No. - What do you think? - It's not my place to advise you. No, but if you were me? If I were you? Shall we have a look at the other letter, too? "I'm 33 and have never been on a farm, but I'm used to hard work." "On Sunday I'll be in the area. I'll be at the Vanersborg station at 5." "layout like, you can meet me there and take me to the farm. Ellen Lind." - Have you been around here before? - No, never. No, it's not often you'd... be in the neighborhood... Ozzi, come. This way. These are laying hens. - Do you get a lot of eggs? - Sure do. It's a nice day. Please, come in. Thank you. Pretty house. Watch your step. Come in. This...staircase leads upstairs, and over here... ...we have the kitchen. Damn, the wood stoves smoking. I was trying to keep the coffee hot. - Would you like some coffee? - Yes. Leis have a look around first, so the kitchen can air out. The maid's chamber is in here. This is the maid's chamber. There's a bit of a view. The sitting room is here. This room isn't used much. Mostly at Christmas. I haven't done much with it since mom died. Nine years ago in August. - Shall we take a look upstairs? - Of course. This is just the sewing room. I'm not so good at that. I'll heat this up, and we'll have some coffee and a sandwich. I'm getting a little hungry. Miss Lind? I thought you'd vanished. I was practically talking to myself Up here and to the left. - Ozzi, go to your basket. Watch your step, it's... Go to your basket! It's in here. Sorry about this... - Cute kittens. - Cuter than the spiders. Princess sneaks up here with them after they're born. I don't have the heart to take them out of here. Do you like cats? Well, that's it. Unless you want to see the barn? - No, thanks, this is enough. - The outhouse is around the back. - And the bathroom? - I don't have one. I do have a tub. Now, I do have money. I have my inheritance from my mother, and there's still some left. And I have money in the bank... - You don't have to... - I want you to know I have means. I have lent some money, but I'll get that back. I can trust him. Lots of flies. You understand, I just don't have time for everything. I... I need a woman's touch. - You don't have any sisters, aunts? - No. - None at all? - None at all - well, an old My mother has a sister in Uddevalla who I haven't seen since the funeral. And you? Do you have a large family? - Things have to change. - Oh, of course. I'm ready for that. - When do you want me to start? - Right away, if you can. - Then I'll come tomorrow afternoon. - Shall I pick you up again? No, I can take the bus. - Then we have an agreement? - There's your pay... We don't have to discuss that until you see what I can do. - I thought you'd say no. - I said yes. Olof! - Guests for coffee? - Would you like some? I didn't think you had time to see them, you were driving so fast. I always have time for that. Which bedroom is mine? So, you're staying? I didn't know Olof had any relatives. - Live ones, anyway. - I don't. You know that. Erik, this is Miss Lind. - Miss Lind, this is Erik Jonsson. I'm going to be the housekeeper here. Housekeeper? Which room? - The one upstairs, if it suits you. - Your mother's room? - I'll go unpack. I have a lotto do. - I bet... - Goodbye, Mr Jonsson. - Erik. Goodbye. She's nice. Ozzi! - Where is he? - Who is she? - She's going to clean for me. - Uh-huh. And sleep in Edith's room? - How long is she staying? - I've done nothing since mom died. - I know. How long is she staying? - I don't know. That's up to her. I see. So I can't have the room any more? - You didn't want to live here. - Not then. I can change my mind. Where the hell are you going? I'm talking to you. Now I can't change my mind any more. - I need someone here I can trust. - You can trust me. Of course. But you don't clean very well. Where did she come from? - I took out... - ...an ad in the paper? "Solitary farmer, 39..." I was at your 40th birthday party. You're not only dumb, you're vain! "Seeking young woman..." You have to be young to keep house? - "Photograph requested." Why? - To see if she seems reliable. I only got two replies. The other one didn't send a picture. I'm going to start dinner. Will Mr Jonsson be eating with us? No, thanks. I'm not hungry, miss...? - Lind. - That's right. Goodbye. If there's nothing else, I'll be off to bed now. No. I'm going to turn in, too. I hope you sleep well. Thanks for your work today. Oh...it's just me. I just wanted to say, if you hear any strange noises, don't worry. Some loose boards on the gable bump against the house in the wind. - There's not much wind now. - No, but you never know. It might pick up. - Otherwise it's quiet here? - Oh, yes, quiet as the grave. Good night again. She's peeing. Good morning. Ozzi! - I heated up water so you can shave. - Oh, I... - But maybe you shave in the evening? - Usually on the weekend. I also wrote a shopping list. I thought you could read through it and see if you want to add anything. - That's not necessary. - Please, so nothing is wrong. Well, this looks just fine. - Maybe some cleanser... - That's at the top of the list. Give it to Erik, he'll get everything. - So he does the shopping? - And a lot more. Then I'll give Erik the list and money, get the receipts from him - - and put them in the box. On the weekend we'll make sure it balances. - You can do as you like, Miss Lind. - Ellen. - layout think that's fitting... - I think we can use our first names. - When are the strawberries ripe? - When they match your nail color. Good morning. - Slept well? - Yes. - No problem with Olof's snoring? - We don't sleep in the same room. I certainly hope not. - How long are you staying? - That depends on what Olof says. He said it was up to you. It doesn't take that long to clean a house. No, but it can take forever to maintain it. - You don't have farmer's hands. - I'm not a farmer. Apparently you do the shopping. I made a list. - Olof read it and approved it. - How nice... Here is some money. I want a receipt. - Y'know... - Speak properly. Show some respect. Mr... What was it? Jonsson. One more thing. You have beautiful eyes. Thank you. - Nine o'clock. - Time flies when you're busy. - Did you have a nice walk? - Yes. - Chicken. - Chicken...? You asked... I like chicken. Then we'll have chicken tomorrow. I'm going to bed, I'm tired. - I hope you sleep better tonight. - I will. I hope you don't mind that I've made some changes in your bedroom. - Good night. - Good night, Ellen. Good morning. Oh, my g... - So, where's the housekeeper? - She's inside. You'd better take that stuff in. If you have the strength. You're looking tired. Are you sleeping well? Yeah... Not the hair! When do you think I can get a little of that horse money back? - You want it back already? - Not now. I was just asking when. I don't know when. You'll get it when you get it - as usual. - Is this her idea? Did you tell her? - No. Good. Don't. - Don't tell her I can't read. - Of course I won't. - Is the house clean? - Yeah. Good food? Feeling like a prince? - So she's worth the money? - Definitely. Twice as much. Well, your clothesline is definitely more interesting. - Here's the stuff. - The clothesline looks nicer now. How do you ladies get into those things? - That corset. - It's easy to put on. But it's not easy to get off. - Isn't that right, Olof? - Shall I put the stuff inside? - Please. On the kitchen table. You didn't say you liked chicken just because I do? - No. - You haven't eaten anything. - Is the head still on the block? - No. - Where is it? - I threw it out. Where? - In the woods. For the foxes. - Nothing goes to waste. Thanks for dinner. Is it already nine o'clock? I thought I'd take a bath... after I do the dishes. - I wondered where the bathtub is. - It's out in the woodshed. But I can carry it inside if you don't want to bathe outdoors. I would prefer to bathe indoors. - That's perfect. - Good. I hope you enjoy it. I've never taken a bath in a kitchen before. There's more hot water here if it starts to get cold. Almost makes me want to jump in. Thanks for the help. Now I need to get undressed and jump in. - OK, I'll...go. - I can't carry the tub back out... Leave it here. I'll take it out in the morning. The door. Good night. Oh... Midsummer... do you want time off then? It's not necessary. I'm happy to stay here. How nice. Go to your basket. Hooray for this land unmatched Hooray for the potato patch which gives us aquavit ...two, three, four, five, si... Skoal! - Here comes someone on a bike. - That's Lena, Erik's girlfriend. - She's not my girlfriend! - Hurry Lena! Out of the lightning! Oh, poor thing... Come have a seal. Lena, this is Ellen. - Ellen, this is Lena. We're in the choir together. - Ellen is my housekeeper. What Midsummer weather! - Do you want anything? - No, I can't stay. - Why aren't you coming? - We're eating. I'll come later. What about the sack race? That's at 7:30. Lena and Erik won last year. He's the best. Is he the best at sack racing in the rain, too? And egg races? Erik can do anything. - Have some schnapps. - She doesn't like it. - Shouldn't you go? Daddy will worry. - Yes, I should be getting back. - Will I see you later? - Maybe. - Well, goodbye then. - Goodbye. - I'm glad I'm not your girlfriend. - She's not my girlfriend. Would you like to dance? - You're asking me? - No, Ellen. - But she's sitting over there. - I'm over here. - This is the best time I've had... - ...since your mother died, I know. - You're drunk and there's no music. - Then I'll put on some music. He's never asked anyone to dance before. Since his mother died? No. it's the first time he's ever asked anyone to dance. There's a first time for everything. No thanks. Maybe later. - So you have secret weaknesses? - If you only knew... Would you like to dance? The strawberries... Sit down, Olof. Sit down and rest. How are you feeling? - He's asleep! - I see that! You can do anything - you must be able to dance. Lone woman on the dance ?oor. I actually dance better than I sack race. Thanks. In one week, you cleaned up the house and stole his heart. You can wrap him around your finger. I bet a hundred kronor he's in love. - How can you be so sure? - How can you know the sun'll go up? - Maybe it won't. - Maybe, but I think it will. You know what that ad should have said? "Solitary farmer, 40..." "...and virgin." - He's still a man. - Yes, as I'm sure you've noticed. How about me? Twenty kronor. Virgin or not? - I'm not a gambler. - No. And I'm not a virgin. Surprise, surprise. But are you a man? We're not talking about me any more I don't know who you are, Ellen. But as long as you're here... Be gentle with him. What do you mean? Now I'm going to go win the sack race. Good luck. Damned tie... - Not easy when you're hung over. - I hardly ever wear a tie. You were wearing one the first time we met. I was thinking of going through the bedroom upstairs - cleaning ii out. But maybe you don't want me to touch your parents' things? I'm just happy not to have to do it myself. Too many memories. - It's your room now. - For now. I'm sorry about yesterday. It won't happen again. You're supposed to be drunk on Midsummer. You were beautiful yesterday. So were you. You've done this before! - Now you're ready for the funeral. - Yes. I'm not looking forward to it. As for man, his days are as grass. As a ?ower of the field, so he ?ourisheth. For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone - - and the place thereof shall know it no more. Thank you Lord for blessings given Thank you for the gifts you gave Thanks for all the days we live and Thank you for this very day Do you usually dig through other people's things? Do you usually walk right into woman's bedrooms? To be perfectly honest, it's happened. - Aren't you at the funeral? - No, apparently not. I don't like funerals. I dig the holes, that's enough. Coffee? Would you like some? - Nice dress. - Thanks. - Too bad about the hole. - What? Oh. I'll have to fix that. Oh, good. - What are you doing? - Taking off my shirt. Why? If you're good at sewing, maybe you can help me with the bottom button. - Can I finish my coffee first? - Of course. So, you can sew, but not pluck chickens? Tell me something about yourself. I can see you've been around. Cookie? Do you like teasing me? I like you, Ellen. I want to know more about you. - I don't know anything about you. - Born here in town, 27 years ago. Ten years ago I got tired of farmers and went to sea. Merchant marines. Back and forth to America. Met everybody. Garbo. Nice, wouldn't talk to anyone but me. I was the only one she let serve her. Prince Bertil - nice guy. Basie, Ellington... ...Charlie Parker. Bad guy, great guy. Then I got tired of the boat. Lived in Memphis for two years. Then I got tired of that, too, and left. I had to go. - Why is that? - Doesn't matter. But...l think I'm the only Swede who ever shook hands with Presley. Elvis. Rock 'n' roll, Ellen! You must have heard it on the radio. Women faint when he walks by! They can't show him on television! - Why not? - Because he's so provocative. He stands like this. Then the music starts... See? They can only show him from the waist up. Then he does like this. And the chicks scream out loud. Really! Hi. How was it? I need to change. I have to take the horses down to the lake. - You've done a beautiful job. - I found some rings. - They're my parents'. - I figured that. The last time I sat here... was when mom died. She...was in a lot of pain... I held her hand. We both knew she didn't have much time left. Then she asked me to take off her ring. This ring. She placed it in my hand, and closed my hand around it. And she said, "When your dad died, he gave me his heart." "And now I'm giving you mine." "What does the sky look like?" she asked. So I went to the window and looked out. There wasn't a cloud in the sky. "That's good," she said. "Then I won't have any trouble finding him." Then she asked what time it was. "Four," I said. "Don't forget to wind the sitting- room clock at nine every night." "Fo..." "Four..." "Four turns to the right and a little more, so the spring doesn't break." Then she closed her eyes and drifted away. - Would you like some coffee? - Yes, please. Let me just finish up. Is it hard? You want to try? Of course you do. Come here. Put the bucket between your feet. Now grasp the teats. Now squeeze and pull. You have to... Like that. - Well, well! What have we here? - Hi. - Practicing? - Just showing her what to do. So I see. If you want to see something really exciting, come out. They came? - What's this? - They're mating the mare. I understand that, but why are they doing it here? Eww... Hi. - Would you like some strawberries? - No, they give me a rash. Here. An installment on my debt. - What do you mean? - I want to do the right thing. See - all written down. Just as it should be. Check it if you want. That's what I made off the horse today. Easy money. How often can he do that? Studs are like men. Find the right one and you can make big bucks. Olof's horses, on the other hand, are a whole different class. They've been to the doctor. They're big, strong, reliable... ...and terribly boring. Olof... Could I have a word with you? - A minute of your time. - Here? You want...? Thanks for the coffee. - What is it? - The money. That I just gave you. - What about it? - I need it back. - You just gave it to me! - That was for her sake. So she won't nag you. I need it tomorrow. I got a great tip. Three to one. It's for you and me. It's just as safe in my pocket as yours. And it'll do more good there than in her coin purse. Olof, do you hear me? Are you falling in love with her? I see how you look at her. You've always listened to me. I'm telling you, take it easy. Give me the money. See you tomorrow. ...Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen... Nineteen. Nineteen fifty-eight plus... Well, the house is clean, anyway. - Was there anything else? - No, I just wanted you to look. You can see yourself in the mirror for once. And in the kitchen ?oor! You can see yourself in just about everything in there. - Obviously a very good housekeeper. - Yes, Olof is happy. Happy? He's on another planet! Suddenly she makes all the decisions about the farm. She decides what to buy. Everything to be paid, she pays. Except me. - You know, she owes me money. - Someone owes you? That's unusual. Are you through? She knows exactly how much milk comes from every cow. How many apples are on each tree. I bet she knows when the eggs are laid! - That's good. - Good?! She's completely taken over! And Olof just takes it lying down. - You seem worried. - You can say that again! You know Olof as well as I do. No way can he get through this. And I don't just mean whether the damned kitchen ?oor is clean. I mean what's going on up here. - How much was it? - 25. - So, it wasn't such a bad idea! - Here. Without you, there wouldn't have been any strawberries. Ellen, you haven't been paid, either. At least let me buy you a gift. What do you want? - What do you need? - Actually, I could use a dress. - Then buy a dress. - That's not enough money. If you want a dress, you'll have one. Let's see here... And now for the piece DE resistance. - I think it's too flowery. - Then we'll get rid of it. It's a very pretty dress. On the right person, of course. - Thanks. - Let's try something else. - Hi. - Hi. What are you doing here? What am I doing here? I'll give you three guesses. - We don't need you to buy anything. - Oh, no? - Did you come to pick up eggs? - Nope. Wrong. Try again. Sorry, I forgot. - We usually go to the races once a month. We had to go downtown. - What do you think? - About the dress. Turn around. One more time. - I like it. - I'm glad. Olof picked it out. Nice, eh? - How long have you been waiting? - When do we usually meet? - Three... - And what time is it? Almost four, I think. Erik, I thought she needed to get out a little. Erik... I've been standing here like an idiot worrying about you. I'm disappointed, Olof. - Are you going by yourself? - What choice do I have? - Shit, I... I'm so sorry... - it's okay. L...l...was coming upstairs because I thought... ...I'd ask you to wear the dress tonight. - I was going to take it off... - Couldn't you put it on again? Then you'll have to help me with the zipper. You can't help me from over there. No... I really like you, Ellen. God, I like you so much. I like you, too. Otherwise I wouldn't be here. Then you... Will you stay? Will you stay here? Why do you ask? - L...l want to be sure. - You can never be sure of anything. But I've never once thought of leaving. I'm going downstairs. Olof! Do you want something to drink? There's a little grass in the glass. Did you have trouble sleeping last night? - I saw you sitting out in the yard. - It was... Yes. layout have as much trouble sleeping tonight, wake me. Hot, isn't it? Do we have to go through this again? - I'm a virgin. - I know. Everyone is the first time. You've got to lose it some time. Right? - What was the first thing you said? - That I had to be home by 10:30. Lena... When we drove off... ...you turned to me and said something. - That I love you. - That's right. Shouldn't I be your first? - Do you love me? - You know I do. - Say it, then. - Why do I have to say it? - I want to hear you say it. - Lena... - I love you. - What? I love you. L...l...I'm...a virgin, Ellen. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I want you to kiss me first. I'd love to. That wasn't so bad, was it? When did you have to be home? - 10:30. - Then we have to go. - Can't we stay a little longer? - You know how your dad is. Are you okay? - You wanted to. I didn't force you. - No. The first time is hard. You have to try if you're going to learn. Why are you doing this with me? You don't have to do it for me. I've gotten along fine without it for 40 years. I can go another 40. I didn't do it for you. I did it because I wanted to. Do you want me to go away? Should I leave the farm? I apologize. I'm sorry. I'm going to bed. Take it easy! Easy, easy... - Teach...me. - What? - Teach me! - Easy... Olof! Don't stop. Keep going. Damned rain... Hello! I knew it! I love you. Do you hear me? I love you, too. Olof! Hi! Horrible weather. - Didn't you hear me calling? - No. - So where is she? - Wasn't she inside? Ellen! - She's getting careless. - Thanks, she must have dropped them. She must have dropped them. So, you're not a virgin any more? No. How the hell could you be so stupid? What do you think she sees in you? What do you have to offer? A rotten house and some damned chickens. I know women, Olof. I've had more than you can count. - There's nothing here for her. - You're jealous. She went for the wrong guy, right? She went for the idiot. - Yeah, she went for the idiot. - Well, I'm sorry. Olof... I'm your friend. I don't want you to make a fool of yourself. Why the hell do you think I took out that ad? To get my kitchen cleaned? I wanted to meet a woman, Erik. This was the only way I could. If you were my friend, you'd congratulate me. Congratulations, Olof. She's fantastic. So is Grace Kelly. Good luck. What are you thinking about? The barn. - Want to go back there? - I don't have the strength. But you would, wouldn't you? No, I was thinking about how the roof leaks. I'll have to get that fixed. - How long has it been like that? - Too long. - Why haven't you done anything? - It's too expensive. - Close your eyes. - They already are. Keep them shut now. Don't peek. Now hold out your hand. Stretch it out. - Olof, I... I can't take this. - Why not? - It's too much. - It's been in the box for ten years. Ellen... The last thing mom said to me wasn't about winding any old clock. The last thing she said was Don't sit all alone up there, Olof "Go out and meet someone." Easier said than done. I want you to have it. I'm not asking anything, just that you wear it. Please. Thank you. Earlier today, when you... when you said you loved me... Did you mean it? Of course I did. Could you say it again? I love you. I love you, Ellen. Can you stop? Can you stop? Whoa! Memphis! That a boy. How much do you owe Olof? You stopped me here to ask me that? What business is it of yours? He paid for your share of the horse, didn't he? - Did Olof tell you that? - No, I guessed. It's none of your goddamned business. - He needs money. - Everybody does. - The whole barn is falling down. - Falling down? What do you mean? There are some holes in the roof! It's been like that for 20 years. The holes aren't the problem. It's the panties on the ?oor. I'd like to know why you're really here. If you're just out for a little fun, you could come to me. What do you say? There's nothing here for you! I've had hundreds of women exactly like you, going to and from America! None of them has fantasized about someone like Olof, I can tell you. He has nothing to offer you! - Hey! You fucking cow! - I only ask one thing. That you sell your stupid car, or your filthy horse... ...and pay back the money you owe! - I'll find out who the hell you are! And where you're from, and what you're after! You fucking bitch! - Shall we? - You know I never dance. - So what are we doing here? - You wanted to come. Can't we leave? I love you. - What? - You heard me. - So? What do you want me to say? - What do you think? I'll say it in the car. I just want to tell Olof something. Wait here. Stand here. Well, well... Aren't you the couple. May I cut in? I'd like a dance with Ellen. Don't ask her, she might say no. I don't know... Okay. I want to apologize. I shouldn't have yelled at you like that. - That's no way to treat a lady. - That's no way to treat a lady. No, exactly. That's why I'm apologizing. Do you forgive me? I meant it, he needs money. He trusts you. You are his friend, aren't you? I'm impressed. You're stubborn. I am stubborn. You smell good, too. Sorry I can't say the same. Dance now, or I'm going back to Olof. - Friends? - layout pay back the money. - Shouldn't that be on the left hand? - It's not a wedding ring. - Olof gave it to me. - I see. it's pretty. Where's the other one? The wedding ring? Maybe he was too cheap to buy one? Olof? Your husband. I've got to go take a leak. I hope I'll be home by dinner. Olof... I love you. Ozzi! Ellen? - Where are you going? - Ellen... I don't know where she is. I think she left. She isn't... She left this. I need you to read it to me. - No. - You have to. I can't read it. - She must know you can't read. - I never told her. No, I can't read this. Sit down and read! I'm begging you, Erik. Please, sit down and read. Dear Olof... I've left the farm. "...and I'm not coming back." Ever since I got here, I've had something to tell you. "Ever since I came, I've been taking the money that Erik paid you..." "...and keeping it for myself." What? - It...it says that? - Yeah. I've been paying it back all summer - for the horse and all. I trusted her. I know you trusted me, and I know I've let you down I'm married to another man. I need to go straighten things out. Until then I can't do anything. How does it end? What did she write at the end? I'm sorry you had to read this... ...but I just couldn't tell you. I'll always love you. "Ellen." That's all, just "Ellen." - Nothing else? - No. I knew it! I knew it all along! ll was written all over her face. - I warned you! - Read it again. No, I won't! I told you what it says! "I left, I'm not coming back and I took Erik's money." it...it doesn't say where she went? You think she'd write a letter like this and leave an address? I've seen this hundreds of times. You'll get over it. The world is full of women. You'll get over it. - Give me the letter. - Don't torture yourself. I'll throw it away. Give me the letter. Give it to me! Olof... I know this is bad timing, but I'm leaving town. I'm signing on to a ship in Gibraltar - the Andrea Doria to America. - I'm going stir crazy here. - When? I'm leaving for Gothenburg tomorrow and heading out from there. Take care of yourself. I can't read, Erik, but I'm not stupid. Forget her. She's not worth it. You can never be sure of anything, but I've never thought of leaving. Thank you. You look tired. Read this to me. - Why do you want me 10...? - Read it. "Dear Olof..." "I've left the farm. Ever since I got here, I've had something to tell..." "I know you trusted me, and I know I've let you down." "I'm married to another man." - Why are you making me do this? - I can't read. Why didn't you tell me? How...does the letter end? How does it end? "I'll always love you. Ellen." You don't have a bag. They're at the station. I didn't know if you wanted me back. Do you want me to come back? Yes. I thought you'd say no. I said yes. The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be - - and that which is done is that which shall be done. There is no new thing under the sun. Let's go home.
