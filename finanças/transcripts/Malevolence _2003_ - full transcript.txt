We go tomorrow or not at all. Did you get what I asked for? So, are they in or what? It's all arranged. We meet here. Where it says. We split the money. And after we split, we split. No contact, no loose ends. The house is safe? Vacant for years. You checked it out? How stupid do you think I am? Well, I wouldn't want to underestimate you. I don't like this. This is way too dangerous. We can't pay off that kind of debt working nine to five. Think about what you're saying. I'm not spending the rest of my life... Scratching off lottery tickets, hoping for a miracle. You're not afraid, are you? I'm no criminal, marylin. What's the alternative, Julian? Spending the rest of our lives in fear? You can't borrow that kind of money from these people and not expect... You think I don't know that? I've never even held a gun before. Two minutes. In and out. They've got everything planned. If your brother's so smart, how come he spent half his life in prison? Max just wasn't working with the right people. Two minutes of your life. We can pay off the note, take what's left, then head south. Or jail. Or worse. He just got out, marylin. How did I let you talk me into this? Get your shit together. We're leaving. Now. We want a single! Ball! - Come on, danno! - Come on, danno! You can do it, honey. Get a hit. She yours? Yes. What's her name? Courtney. She's really somethin', shes. I'm Sally. Samantha. Home run. Hit one. Then run. - Strike three! - Come on, Megan. Here. - I'm not shooting anyone. - Take it. Look, anyone gets in your face, squeeze. Shoot someone, get eight, out in five. You fuck with their money, they're gonna throw away the key. Well, you would know. If you get caught, you might as well put that barrel in your mouth. You wouldn't last five minutes upstate. You'll be fine. You can do it. We talked this over. Nobody backs out now. What the hell is this? You don't want your face on the evening news, do you? I told you I wanted snow white. Tough. You're the wolf man. I don't want to be the wolf man. All right. Let's go. Come on! Freeze! Come on! Police are on the lookout for a group of bank robbers who stormed into the first bank and trust downtown at exactly 2:15 this afternoon. Eyewitnesses claim the assailants were wearing Halloween-like masks... Hungry? No. How about some ice cream? Are you gonna sulk all day? Everyone has a bad game once in a while. You don't have to make excuses. I know I stink. You're not the first person to miss a ground ball. We lost the game. You scored a run. You've got a great swing. You don't understand. Sure, I do. When I was your age, I was never any good at sports either. He's bad. Drive faster! I told you this was a mistake! - This is your fault! - How was I supposed to know there were two guards? You had a clear shot. They killed him. They killed him! Oh, yeah. Whoo! Yes! Shit! Fuck! Shit! Hi. Hi. Ten dollars. What pump number? Uh, number five. Another assailant was shot and wounded by a bank security guard. The extent of his injuries are unknown. An all-points bulletin was sent out, alerting police across the state. We've also learned that roadblocks are being set up... Around the perimeter of the city. Thank you. Are you sure you don't want some ice cream? From a gas station? What's the difference? Okay. What flavor do you want? What are you doing? I'm looking for my mitt. It's not in your bag? No. I checked. It's gotta be there. It's not. What flavor do you want? Um, sherbert. Okay. Found it. It was under the... They didn't have sherbert, so I got you fudge. Gettin. Hey. How is he? He's not gonna make it. Where are we? On our way. We're on our way. Is anyone following us? No. No. We made it, Max. They never knew what hit 'em. I'm sorry. What? For what? Don't let Kurt screw with you. Max. Where are you taking us? Please. Can't you just take the Van... you open your mouth again, baby Ruth eats a bullet. I don't want to hurt you, but you're pushing Mel It"s okay. Sit down. Don't move. Mommy. It's gonna be okay. We can't just leave him here. Well, we can't bring him with us. I'm not leaving him by the side of the road! Marylin, we gotta get rid of the body. Then you bury him. There's no time, marylin! It's your fault he's dead! Quick. My hands. I warned you. Run! Courtney, run! Run, Courtney! Run! Help! Help! Hello? Is anybody here? Come on out, Courtney. You little shit. Uncle Kurt's got a surprise for ya. No! Say something. He was your brother. I hardly knew him. Okay. Uh, dear god, wherever you are, please watch over Max's soul. Uh, accept him into heaven. He didn't know any better. The son of a bitch better be there. Now what? We meet Kurt where we planned, and we divide the money. What if he changed his mind? He's too afraid of Max to screw around. Max is dead. Kurt doesn't know that. - Where are you going? - There's no names on these... Goddamn streets. What does it say? The last few were just some frickin' landmarks. It's gotta still be here. Well, what do you want me to do? Get out and ask for directions? Don't yell at me. - Kurt and Max worked this out. - Lot of good that does us now. Is this it? He was right. No one will find us here. I don't see Kurt's car. You're sure this is the place? Hey. Hello. Hello. Hey. We're not gonna hurt you. We're not gonna... Jesus Christ! Who is she? If I take my hand away, you promise not to scream? You have to help me. My daughter. She... she ran to get help. He chased after her. I don't know what happened. He has a gun. What's going on? Untie me. We have to get out of here before he comes back. Why are you doing this? I have to get out of here, please! Where's Kurt? I won't say anything. Just let me go. I have to find my daughter. The Van. He must have ditched the car. Where's the fucking money? Help! Help Mel help! Shut up! Shut up. Okay. Mary. There's 40,000... if that. Son of a bitch! Maybe it's all we got. I watched them empty the safe... Plus four drawers! There should be 10 times the amount! It's gotta still be here. Why? Because he wouldn't hijack a car, drive all the way here, leave just enough money to guarantee he'd have to grow eyes in the back of his head, then take off on foot. - And leave a witness behind? - Are you that naive? How do you know this isn't a setup? They picked this spot! I bet the fucking cops are on their way right now! What about her? I mean, why not take her along? For insurance. I mean... This? This isn't even enough to cover the fucking interest! How the hell did I let you talk me into this? Let me think. I just have to think. Shut up. Shut up! Just calm down. Okay? Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Look. I promise. No one is gonna hurt you. I promise I will hurt you if you don't shut up! Hey. Shit. What are we gonna do? I'm gonna go look for him. Didn't risk my neck for nothin', I mean her. We can't just let her go. What are you saying? I'm saying that we can't just let her go. Well, what do you want to do? You want to kill her? You'd rather see us in jail? Oh, Jesus Christ, marylin. I'm not going to prison because Kurt screwed up. You should have thought about that before robbin' a bank. This wasn't part of the plan. Neither was a bullet in Max's stomach. Jesus. I told you this was a mistake! You are a coward. No, I'm an asshole. Marylin. What? Would you come here, please, and look at this. Yeah? And? Why would Max bring... A shovel, and a can of gasoline... To Rob a bank? I knew it. Maybe he was planning to bury the money. Maybe he was planning on buryin' us. No. Did you know about this? What are you talking about? Oh, you think I'm stupid. That's ridiculous. Max wouldn't ever do anything... Oh, am I the odd man out here? No. Give me the gun. Why? Give me the gun. What for? Just give me the gun, marylin. Shut up. Just shut up. If I was in on it... If we were gonna kill you, why were there two bags? Just give me the fucking gun! It's obvious he was gonna kill us both. You were right. My brother really was an asshole. He never gave a shit about me. I just want to get away... Get out of here. I'm so tired of being afraid. You're all I've got. That's why... Max insisted on sitting in the back... And us up front. That son of a bitch. Where are you going? The Van is still here. That means he can't be that far away. I'm gonna go look for him. But where will you go? You won't find him. Stay here. Just take this. All right? What? And keep it low. Don't wanna draw any more attention to this place. Attention? Out here? From what? Bugs? Shit! Where do you think you're goin'? What? You have to go to the bathroom? Sure. I untie you, you take off and run to the cops. I wasn't born yesterday. Kurt? Don't look at me like that. It wasn't my idea to bring you here. Screaming isn't going to help you! That's the reason I gagged you in the first place. Stop it! I'm warning youl! Kurt? We're screwed. There's cops everywhere. I think one of 'em might have followed me here. Mary? Marylin! Where is she? What happened? Call the police. Are you crazy? He... he killed her, he killed her. Oh, god. Who? Who killed her? Tell me! Oh, god. Call the police. Was it Kurt? Was it the guy that kidnapped you? Yes! Please call the police! Look at my face, lady! The last person I wanna see right now is a fuckin' cop! I have to find my baby. Wait! Please! I don't care what you did or who you did it to. Please! Come on. Oh. Attention, all units. Be on the lookout for a tan Ford l.T.D., license plate whiskey-zebra-Alpha 950. Suspect vehicle was last seen fleeing the robbery... Of the first bank and trust in whitehall township. Proceed with caution. Suspects armed and dangerous. Repeat... Central, this is Riley. I did a drive-by on a similar car earlier tonight. I'm gonna go check it out. Courtney! Courtney! She could be anywhere. We'll find her. I never meant for any of this to happen. We'll find her. I promise you. What is this place? Courtney. Let's get out of here. Courtney? Courtney! Courtney! Oh, god. Jesus Christ! Come on. What the hell's goin' on here? Mommy? Courtney? Courtney? Mommy! - Oh, my god! - Mommy. Oh, my god. You all right? God. I was so scared. Kurt? Mommy! Let's get out of here. Come on. Hurry. Lift your leg. No! Courtney! Mommy! No! No! No! Ohh. No! No! No! No! No! No! Get away from me! Mommy! Quick! Give me your hands! Come on. Come on. Quick! Run! This way! Go! Mommy! Courtney, run! No! Oh my leg! Roll up the windows! - The keys! - What? - The bastard took my keys! - The spare! Where are they? You put it in my bag! Where's your bag? The man took it. Oh, no. Go. Get out. Hey! - Courtney, wait! - I know where they are! Hurry, Courtney! Oh, god. Is he gone? There's no way out! The window! Quick. Climb out. Go. Oh, god. I"m slipping! Ahh! Oh, god! Come on! It's okay. Come on. Don't drop me! Hold on! I'm slipping! Just reach! I got you. Who are you? Run! Help! Freeze! It"s 10:00 A.M. Thursday morning, and here's what's happening. Residents of northern valley are... Awakening to the grim news that police may have uncovered the home of a serial killer right here in our own backyard. Details are still sketchy, but apparently the discovery has some connection with the brazen bank robbery that took place yesterday. Federal and local authorities have descended on the home of Graham sutter, the former owner of sutter farms, whose dead body was found upstairs... In a morbid, semi-preserved state. So far no suspects are in custody, and local residents are to remain calm. We'll bring you more information as we receive it. Don't they have any goddamn signs on these roads? You Riley? You wanna tell me why I had to get up at 4:00 in the morning... To drive nine hours to get to the middle of nowhere? Twenty-nine years. Twenty-nine years. Nothin' like this. Better call your missing persons bureau, tell 'em... We got a lot of unhappy endings up here for 'em. Parker? Get in there. Tell 'em to touch nothin' I want this whole... Area sealed off. Nobody gets in or out of here without my authorization. Officer. What can you tell me about this place? Not much. Used to be a meat and poultry slaughterhouse. Closed down back in the 1970s. And the owner? Kept to himself. This place has been abandoned as far as I can remember. I found an assortment of accounting ledgers... Dating back to 1956. Last one was 1977. This one's the most interesting. "There weren't even glimpses this time. Just a complete blank. "I don't even remember what I ate... "Or how I got up here into the bone furnace. I must find something to do with myself" there's more. January '87. "She didn't even put up a fight. "The bull was pleased and touched my shoulder, "and another sin was forgiven. "I must get some help cleaning up. I just can't bear it." It gets better, or worse, depending on your point of view. February '89. "Brought home a boy from the valley. "He's young enough to learn the business my way. "He doesn't talk much. Think maybe he's scared or stupid. March '89. "Caught him trying to escape today, "so I've put him into an extremity bag in the cellar. "I hate to do it, but I have no choice. He'll just have to learn the hard way." After that, one last entry: "He's gonna do it tonight. "I saw it in his eyes. He's hunting me. "Silent, just like I showed him. "I know he's in my closet, waiting, "patient. "I thought about fighting him off but he's so strong... So young. "I hope it's quick. Not that I deserve it" didn't you have a "spat" of disappearances in this area a few years back? That's right. And it never occurred to you... To investigate this place? Just the kind of place that gets overlooked. Like an old tree in the middle of a cornfield. Mrs. Harrison, special agent William Perkins. We spoke briefly at the hospital yesterday. As you know, I've got two investigations I'm dealing with, one of course... Being the multiple homicide here in ironton township. I assure you we're doing everything in our power... To apprehend the suspect you described. The other is the ongoing criminal investigation into the armed robbery of the first bank and trust in whitehall township. I understand and respect your wishes not to relive these disturbing events at this point in time, but however bizarre the circumstances, you are a witness to both crimes. There's still... The matter of $450,000 unaccounted for. By the way... The forensics team here says they've retrieved some personal items of yours, but no luck on your wallet or keys. If anything turns up, I'll be in touch. In the meantime, you can reach me at the number on the card I gave you. Hope to hear from you soon. Take care. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Mommy. Can I sleep with you? Come on.
