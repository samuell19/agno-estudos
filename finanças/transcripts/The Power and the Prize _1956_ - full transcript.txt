Good afternoon, sir. Amalgamated World Metals. Good afternoon. Amalgamated World Metals. Mr Barton's office. Hello, Mrs Everett. Can I have Mr Everett call you? He's in there, but Mr Barton is on the phone. You only get married once, Joanie. Well, I hope you only get married once. "Cliff, how far is this hydro site from the mine?" It's 28 miles the way we take the power line. You have a map there, Mr Salt. Consider the copper reserves to the north west. Cliff? Yes. I am still here. Oh, you should see me now. I am really the most gorgeous armful. Was that uncle George? Right. That British deal. He's with Guy Eliot watching some West Africa film. "Hey, Cliff." Is this an earth-filled dam or masonry? "Earth." Where do we get the earth? "There must be a hill that doesn't show right behind the camera." "It's on the survey map. They pointed the camera the wrong way." Eliot, what is it about the British at Singapore? They pointed the guns in the wrong direction. Cliff, that water is muddy. Do we have a silting problem? Mr Salt, will you stop lousing up my phone call. I am trying to negotiate a marriage. "It's your own niece. Do you want me to lose the deal?" "No. The silting problem isn't too bad." "Lester Everett has some notions. Do you want to talk to him?" Not if he's thought about it. Get yourself married. Your father is expecting you to pick him up at seven. Mr Everett's wife needs to reach him. - I'll tell him. Joanie, you still there? You should see me now. It gets better and better. How can you wait? What? You can say that. You can't truly be interested in someone you have known since she was twelve. There's a few things about you Joanie you didn't have when you were twelve. How long do you think it will take them? Just a minute. Maybe I'd better go and hold Chutwell's hand before he jumps out the window. Boy, do these English have some special neuroses. Your wife has been trying to reach you. That reminds me. I want some advice. Guy Eliot has offered us that lodge of his up in Maine. Cliff, you know that lodge of his. It is like a .. Like a branch of the Founders Trust company. You know how it is. Guy Eliot is not only the head of the Founders Trust. He's the one real power on our board of directors. It is why your uncle is clearing this deal with him, before we get in deeper. "Can I see you in my office, Cliff?" Yeah. Right away. D-Day, honey. Got to get on to the big deal. We've held up progress long enough. I'll talk to you later, huh? Bye-bye. Hello, Mr Barton. How did we do? - Great, great. I knew everything was going to be alright before we went in there. Guy Eliot offers you and Joanie his lodge. You are going to use it, aren't you? - Sure. Joanie is crazy about it. Well, you will never have any trouble with Joanie. There is a girl that knows what's what. Lester. Gentlemen, be seated. With Charlie Frost here, somebody needs airplane tickets. Well somebody does. Malaria pills? Not yet. It's time now we all got together on this West African project. Some of you are acquainted with only certain phases of it. Since it's largely our vice-chairman's baby I will let Cliff take over. Briefly, the background is this. You have all heard of Carew Limited. An old British metals house. They've had a large minerals concession in West Africa for half a century. Nickel and copper chiefly. The reserves are proven but they couldn't exploit them. Mostly, lack of fuel. But all that has changed. Perhaps. Carew's engineering division under the direction of a man named Chutwell .. Has perfected a coal smelting process. It is revolutionary. It could change all smelting processes someday. And in Lester's opinion and mine it will work. Is it the decision we want in? Well, if the process works as well at the London pilot plant .. As it does on paper in Lester's office, yes. Cliff, how much do they want? - Forty million, working capital. Lester is flying to London no later than tomorrow. He will inspect the pilot plant and operation. And if it is Lester's opinion that the process is practical then .. Your vice chairman. Will accompany him. And will go into immediate negotiations with Carew. You were right Charlie about the airline tickets. Get to work. That's all, boys. Could I see you in a few minutes? I have got a personal problem. You have got a personal problem? Alright. I will see you. In case you'd forgotten .. A lady named Joan Salt, your niece, expects me to marry her this Saturday. You're coming to dinner tonight with your father. You can straighten her out. You have got a gift that way. - Well, thank you. Mr Salt, I don't care if I get married this Saturday or 3 weeks from Saturday. But Joanie is young. - It will be good for her. Relax. Cliff, you know. You are my eternal joy. If I'd a son of my own, by now he would probably be an irretrievable nincompoop. Instead, when I want to give her a 'facts of life' speech, I have you. You know, a woman that marries a man like you or me has got a lot to learn. Mrs Salt learnt a lot. Why do you think companies make a fuss about the women their executives marry? Why do you think World Motors for instance .. Employs a detective agency for the exclusive purpose .. Of investigating the prospective wives of even their junior executives? You are public property when you get up there, Cliff. Your wife, in a way, is public property too. You have no private life and no private rights. It takes a rare kind of woman to fill that bill. Mrs Salt filled it. Joanie is the right kind. She'll come along fine. But let me say something. You will save yourself a lot of grief later ion if she finds out now. Finding out that what is necessary for Amalgamated .. Is necessary for her. Yeah? "Mr Everett and Mr Chutwell." - Just a minute. But is it necessary? I think it is. We've got the inside track on this deal. Do we have to move this fast? Cliff. You know and everyone around us knows that I am getting along and .. You will be taking over this chair before long. I have absolute confidence that you will do the job that I have done. Maybe more. Thank you, Mr Salt. Or are you going to say 'but' something? But. This has been a one-man shop. I built Amalgamated up from a collection of closed mines and bankrupt mills. So, when people think of Amalgamated they think of me. You have got to start thinking of you Cliff before you step up. Or you are going to be at a disadvantage. You see, they have got to be afraid of you. There is a bigger prize in this British deal than meets the eye. If you can pull off what I think you can pull off they will be convinced. The banks. Washington. The stock holders. Everybody. You will have what you need. You will be ready. There are times Mr Salt when you scare the daylights out of me. Well, try to imagine how scared I'd be at my age if I didn't have you. But I will talk to you tonight. And be glad that you are marrying the right kind of woman at a time like this. Send Sedwill in will you. The way the English offer you cigarettes out of silver cigarette cases. If they knew how to package cigarettes properly .. They wouldn't have to carry silver cigarette cases. Mr Barton, sir. I've just heard the momentous decision. A great day, sir. A cigarette? No thank you, He is waiting for you. That is a great man in there, sir. A great man. A great country you have got here too. It leaves a chap sort-of awestruck sir. Ah. Mr Salt, sir. Don't tell me what you want to go to London for. I know what you want to go to London for. You want to go to London like fellows want to go to conventions. What do you think I was, born yesterday? Giving me all this hanky-panky deals business. Ella. Do you think I don't know what you fellows are looking for? Deals? Ha-ah. Deals, spiels. You dimwit. The doorbell is ringing. The doorbell is ringing. What? You have turned off your hearing-aid on me? You did it again. Don't you dare tear your hearing-aid off on me. What kind of guy turns off his hearing-aid on his own wife? Stupid. Mr Barton. - Hello, Mrs Everett. You didn't tell me that he was coming. Mr Barton, I look such a mess. I have never seen you more handsome or vital. I was on my way down to Mr Salt's for dinner .. And I just had to stop by for one of your famous old-fashioneds. You know, to celebrate Lester's coup. - Lester's what? The greatest engineering mind in America, Mrs Everett. The greatest. Now he's proved it again with this London deal. How proud you must be of him. - Me? Oh yes. My, but you are looking like a million dollars. How do you do it? How about that old-fashioned? Gee, Mr Barton. You always know the right things to say to me. That old Lester. He knows the funniest things. You were up at Lester's longer that you thought. Sorry, dad. Now we can get on down to Salt's. Was Mrs Everett that difficult? - No, no. I just don't understand a man who can't handle his own wife. That's because you are not married. This is certainly your evening for straightening out wives. Present and future. - Yeah, it's a nuisance. Right when I am on the verge of something so big. When you were that high I thought I knew you. Now you are that high I have lost all track. Why do you say that? I'm not criticising. I was the one who missed the boat. Cliff, are you sure you want to get married? Well son, I only asked. - What a question. There is nothing wrong about Joanie. Of course not. I adore her. She is far too young for you. She hasn't much to bring you, but .. A fine time to start taking attitudes. You are quite right. I am the preacher who doesn't preach. That's why I have such a large, rich, smug, fashionable congregation. I apologise. You'd never find a better example of why Joanie is right for me .. Than the woman I've just seen. Look what she is doing to Lester's career. Alright. You don't approve of my values. Look Dad, there is a vast gap between us which is hard to cross. Because you are a most ideal human being and I am not. Well, there is room for all sorts. No. I am not going to preach. But if there's some woman in this world beside Joanie .. Whom you really want to marry .. Then I am going to pray that you never meet her. When you get to London. Eventually. I wonder if you would mind running a few errands for me. I would be glad to, Mrs Salt. I have several charities I would like you to look into. One in particular for which I am the American chairman. It's an organization for refugees coming out of central Europe. Yeah. I would like to you to look into where the money goes. Their general efficiency, what they spend on overheads. Any subversive infiltration. Give me a list. I would be delighted. I didn't .. I didn't know you were going to London. When? Tomorrow. Well, you might at least have let Cliff tell her that. Why? Well. I don't see anything so important. Now I can go out to North Hampton for the weekend. I want the title to the West African concession vested in Amalgamated. I want a joint corporation with 52% of of the stock in Amalgamated treasury .. And you as chairman. I'm overwhelmed, but that is impossible. If things are impossible then you've got to move fast. That isn't Carew's proposition. It is their concession, their process, our money and their show. Our show. They will turn to a competitor. - I don't think so. With these terms they won't even go into negotiation. They will if you don't tell them the terms. You can pull this off, Cliff. You have the gift. Now, go into negotiation with them and make them like it. Confine your discussion to costs. Tell them forty million is outrageous. And prove they don't need it. We'll feed you the figures every day by cable. This is the kind of a job that we know how to do. And they know we know how to do it. When you've reached a rock-bottom figure. They will see costs down, profits rising and they'll wish we were doing the job. And then. Then a call from New York. We are sorry, the investment is still too big. We'll have to run the show. They will come along and believe me it is human nature. We can make more money for them than they can make for themselves. Yeah, I can do it. - You're blessed right you can do it. When you get West Africa safe in the New York bag .. There won't be a competitor, banker, stockholder or secretary of state .. That doesn't say 'Cliff Barton' the way they have always said 'George Salt'. With respect and admiration. And with fear. Do you see what I mean by the prize? I am wondering what my father would say to a deal like this. Let me tell you about your father. He's as fine a man as I have ever met, god bless him. He believes in live and let live .. And what would the world be like without men like him. But what would the world be like without men like us? Still rolling in ox-carts? Still grappling with famine and disease. Believe me, Cliff. Men who, in truth, saved the world were never stopped by the ten commandments. I hope the day will come Mr Salt when I can be as truthful as that. It will, Cliff. Mr Carew. - Mr Barton. You haven't met my associate, Mr Pitt-Semphill. Hello. How do you do. I hope you're enjoying London. Bowled over. I am always bowled over. What I never understand is, I wear the right hats. How do people know I'm an American? Perhaps your vitamins are showing. Let's go upstairs, shall we. What I can't understand how you people Mr Barton, so aware of the future .. Can come over here and tolerate for a moment .. Our smoky monuments, our chauvinism. Our embalmed heroes, each with his own statue. As a rule, in the worst possible taste. If I were you I'd paint moustaches on them. Well, in a curious way Mr Carew they are our heroes too. I handed over that list of Mrs Salt's organisations .. To some of the people in our office, Mr Barton. I apologise for creating a nuisance, Mr Pitt-Semphill .. But you know how it is. The boss's wife. No nuisance at all. I am not one of those who resent Americans every time they're generous. What Pitt-Semphill is dying to ask you with baited breath .. Is how did you survive our Mr Chutwell? Yes, I know. I know. Our Mr Chutwell I feel is something of a thruster. Then you see, he is also something of a genius. Our new process is, in a very large part his. The older I grow Mr Barton the more impressed I am with what men are. And not what they seem. Forgive me. If I am going to say something to which you won't approve. At this stage it is bad business. I am praying that your Mr Everett will approve of our process .. And that we may enter the negotiations. Because I like you. That's very good of you. You know, we are all so aware of America these days. We are jealous. We are suspicious. Well, it is natural I suppose. Our pride. We are not accustomed to being paupers. Well, we shall never be beggars. Not on this island. You know, I'd be so happy to work with you on the West Africa plan, Mr Barton. Well, let's face it. Pride. First pride. Is a factor. I know West Africa. And in the opinion of many of us in many parts of the world we have London. London. London, half an empire away. Now, our new process gives us me an opportunity of going into West Africa. And proving to a somewhat sceptical world .. That if Britain has erred. She has likewise learnt. I apologise for my deplorable chauvinism. Cheers. The thing that is starting to trouble me Mr Salt is this strategy. Now look, Cliff. Don't go soft. These people are a nation of swindlers. They invented swindling. They perfected swindling. They made swindling socially acceptable. Mr Salt. Did I tell you he sends his blessings? That makes me very happy. Now let me be clear. We will begin negotiations on Monday. And do I understand that Amalgamated has no reservations .. Other than costs and the size of the financing? We have strong reservations concerning your cost estimates. Yes, of course. I understand that and you are probably right, but .. No other reservations? Generally, no. But this is a tentative statement. I don't like to enter negotiations with my hands tied. I hope you think again about coming to the country for the weekend. My wife will be so disappointed. I am so sorry but I do have plans for the weekend. I must be running. Until Monday then. Ah. He is holding something back otherwise he would have accepted your invitation. You have an obsession, Pitt. All Americans are not unscrupulousness like Dan Slocum. Well. I shall go down to the country. With my wife. Get mildly .. Pleasantly, and entrancingly pickled. Cliff. Come in to Chutwell office. - Chutwell is your problem. Not mine. But you don't know what Chut's come up with. You know that refugee organisation of Mrs Salt's? The one for refugee artists? - What about it? Boy, what a dilly. Come on. Chut will tell you about it. I see. Thank you very much indeed. Oh, I say. Mr Barton. This Artists Refugee Organisation, 221 Rockwell place. Mrs Miriam Linka, executive secretary. Yeah. What is wrong with it? - Wrong with it? Nothing. Emphatically so. No. A most high-minded organisation. It finds jobs for these talented refugees. Painting, singing, dancing. Of course. Human nature. It is difficult to control. And some of these young lady refugees have talents .. That go, let's say, beyond playing the piano. Or. Or if the employer, to say myself, has a broad view of the term 'entertainment'. I'll find out about it. I am sure you will do all the better. Does Mrs Linka know what is going on? Don't go to Mrs Linka. No. She's a blooming commie or something. She will tear you to pieces. There is some that ask questions and some that don't. Now. Mr Retchnikov. He is the chap. He never asked for one moment what kind of a piano. Thank you. But you won't have to lift a finger. Don't say no. It has all been arranged. I've spoken to Mr Retchnikov myself. A little entertainment. Saturday night. The three of us. No, this is my party. I insist. Supper and champagne. And three gay companions. With a touch of, shall we say, the continental manner. Sorry. I have other plans. - Come on. You can afford to waive ranks for an evening. It's nothing to do with waiving rank. Well I shall take this as a personal affront. Take it any way you please. Well I am accustomed to snubs. I understand perfectly. But I must say it all seems a bit pretentious coming from an American. Cliff. Are you Mrs Linka? - Yes. You are Mr Barton? Yes. You are .. You are an American millionaire?. I suppose. Of course. Well. In that case I must offer you some tea. You may offer me an expensive American cigarette. I'll offer you the pack. I am quite ruthless about such things. I will take them. You may have one. Please do. Are you interested yourself in the work of the organisation or .. Are you just an errand boy for Mrs Salt? I am interested in it myself very much. I doubt that. Well. It is our purpose to find work for talented refugees from central Europe. We have lived most of us .. In a world of Mozart, Schumann, Chopin. For most of us, music was a reason for life. You may report to Mrs Salt that the work of the organisation goes well. If by going well one means the placing of a concert pianist .. In a job as a dishwasher at The Ritz. If I report to Mrs Salt on how her money is used what do I say of certain rumors? Certain rumors? Please. Will you be more precise. An interesting racket, Mrs Linka. I have no objections at all. If you weren't masquerading as a charity and shaking down patrons like Mrs Salt. I would ask you to leave this office. Since you represent Mrs Salt I cannot afford to. Berta. Did Retchnikov call you? Yes. He called me. Tear his eyes out. You are not going. [ German language ] Yes. The rumours are true. There are those who take advantage of the situation. And there are girls like her who have no choice. And if you would know that much. That very much. Dear Mr American, about despair. Then you would not ask such silly questions. Or perhaps Mr Barton, you are here yourself to .. Take advantage of the situation? No. No. I'd rather make a contribution to the legitimate work of the organisation. How much? A thousand dollars? How very nice it must be to .. To just suddenly give away a thousand dollars. No. No. I .. I want you to deposit the cheque .. To our account at the Westminster Bank next week perhaps. Then you will not be giving so much money in embarrassment. To make you feel better. Because on a dismal afternoon you found me in this wretched place .. Having my poor cup of tea and you felt in yourself such .. Such beautiful pity. Do you question the motives to every contribution? In many ways, Mr Barton. I am a very nasty person. I will be at the address I have noted on the cheque during the daytime. And Mrs Salt will want a written report. Could I have it tomorrow? It is Saturday. We close at four. I may have it. I may not. There are people coming. I have very much to do. Thank you for the cheque. [ German language ] Just a minute. Just a minute. Well? What's that? That colonial development report they were talking about? Cliff. About that Chutwell thing yesterday. You know, he is not really too bad a fellow. He worked his way up from the bottom. That doesn't happen very often here. Not like in the U.S. He feels insecure. He gets nervous around people like you. Cliff. I don't know how to say this. You know how things are with me back home. With Ella. Would you mind too much if I went out him tonight? Huh? Oh. No. Go ahead and enjoy yourself. Oh. Hiya, Mr Retchnikov. Yes. Good afternoon, Mrs Linka. And what do you want? The report isn't ready. What is it? Do you want your cheque back? - No. I'm only here to make you laugh. Jokes. Perhaps some song and dance? No, no. Just jokes. You don't need to bother undressing your coat. I am locking up. Well, I hope you are having dinner with me too. I hope you are not hoping too much. Because I am not. I guess you have another engagement, or are you having dinner with Mister Linka? There is no Mister Linka. There is not another engagement. I don't see how you can't like me. You don't even know me. I don't like Americans. I don't like Lords of the world. Not of any nation. I don't like people who do things just like that and write cheques for $1,000. I don't like businessmen. I don't know you. That's right. You don't. You haven't given me a chance to tell you when I left your office yesterday .. I went out and bought the lives of Schumann and Mozart. Oh no. See. I told you I could make you laugh. You only make me laugh because you are so pathetic. You haven't got the least idea of what to say. I invested 5 shillings in the lives of 3 composers and I've a great deal to say. You didn't let me mention Chopin. - Chopin .. If you would let me take you to dinner. - I am not going to dinner with you. If I came. Where would we go? I thought, Claridge's. You wanted to say 'In your rooms' didn't you? I have thought of it. - But you didn't think it was proper. Say it, for heaven's sake. While I count ten, that you didn't think it was proper. I didn't think it was proper. - There. You see. What would you do if I hadn't said it? - Kill you. Thank goodness my father is a Presbyterian minister. I was raised right. Why did you have to say that? I hate Presbyterians. They burned Michaels Michael Servetus. I can't possibly come now. You spoiled everything. I assure you my father had no hand in it. Americans burn people. They burned witches, didn't they? That's ridiculous. We stopped that almost 300 years ago. You think it is very noble to almost stop burning people. No, that's .. You feel very noble yourself because you have given a great deal of money .. To organizations that try to almost stop people from almost burning other people. You put words in my mouth. You took it off your income tax and it hardly cost you anything. Isn't that right? That's right. Well, you provoke me but I shall keep calm. Because the first thing I know .. You'll give another $1,000 in Michael Servetus' name for a statue or similar. I am sure that is how your mind works. Doesn't it? No. No. What time shall I see you at Claridge's? Well, let's say 8 o'clock, but I am picking you up. You are not picking me up. I have to pick you up. - It wouldn't be proper. No. It's going to rain and you won't find a taxi. Not at that hour. Where I live is precisely what I am not going to tell you. What shall you wear to Claridge's? I though shirtsleeves. - You are so tactful. You say that because you think I have nothing to wear. Well, you will dress to the teeth because that is how I expect to dress. Oh. Anyone using the piano? Not a soul in the shop all day, Mrs Linka. That will be five shillings. Would you call me please at a quarter to six? Certainly. Taxi. Taxi! Miriam. Sorry I am late. Come on. Come on, let's go. How did you know where I lived? Oh. It didn't take much ingenuity. I went to your office and knocked down the door. I left some money on your desk by the way to have it repaired. There are usually address books lying around an office. And as luck would have it I remembered your name. An American method. What bothered me was how long it all took. And you waiting. It was almost the end of the war. When my husband was killed by the Nazis. He was in the Austrian resistance. Just two months more and .. You loved him? - Yes I did. Very much. Three years separated by war. Three years for me in the concentration camp at Ravensbr?ck. It's not easy to explain. The being hungry. The day-to-day filth. How do I survive until tomorrow. In a concentration camp one is like an animal and like an animal one forgets. When I heard he was dead it was like someone else. It was like somebody I had met perhaps at a party. There are so many things, Mr Barton. One should not ask question of another. The war is one of those things for me. And for so many of us. So, let it be put away someplace and forgotten. After the war too, for that matter. At Vienna. So I say enough. Too much. Three years ago, London. The refugee artists. And here I am. You have listened with such patience, Mr Barton. To the sad and sorrowful story of my life. Now it is your turn. And you will show me please .. Like all right-thinking American businessmen .. The picture of your wife in New York. And of your most enchanting children. Oh, they don't? I am so sorry. No. It was alright. I was thinking about you. Of course. And I am always so mean to you. But I shall not be mean to you now. After such a dinner. That brutal American beefsteak. And I have eaten it all. And. I must say I am sorry for this afternoon when you came to my office. But you see, I had just resigned from my position. What happened? Was it a Mr Chutwell who told you certain things? You wrote the same address on the cheque. Chutwell is no friend of mine. Oh. That is a relief. Well, this Mr Chutwell. You see, it's not the first time that he entertains an American. It is not just Americans. That is unfair. And anyway, it is a most unimportant crisis. But tonight is Anna. She has her husband dying someplace. And Berta. You saw Berta. She is so young and decent. Perhaps I am stupid. I should understand when great enormous and rotten situations create refugees .. And leave a girl with no home, no family. No place, no hope for dignity. And for her, how small is this. This final humiliation. I am stupid to check. And there comes a time when one must be stupid. Necessarily stupid. Or no longer does one exit. I must say what I believe. Do what I must do. Kick Mr Retchnikov in the shins. That was the pleasant part of it. I must speak, act, shout aloud or I die. Don't be a fool. Get up on that table and shout. I'll go along. There is something in you. I never suspected. There is something in me I never suspected. You are. Quite extraordinary. I make the jokes please. - I am not joking. I don't like Americans. I don't like overwhelming people. But. I do like you. Don't say that. The second time in two days .. That someone I respected with whole heart said they liked me. Let's go dancing someplace. Let's get out of here. It was the kind of evening one dreams of on Sullivan Square. Take it away. I won't need you. - Yes, sir. You are not coming in. No. I am walking back to the hotel. I need the walk. What time shall I see you tomorrow? - I am no seeing you tomorrow. I am busy. I need a job. You can't find a job on Sunday. Mr Barton. It is no good. I am a disturbance to you and you to me. It is so plain. It has been a happy meeting but let us be sensible. Tomorrow night then at eight? - I'm not seeing you tomorrow. Or again. Alright then. Monday at four. Five? Stop overwhelming me. I will not be overwhelmed. Overwhelmed? - Overwhelmed. Seven-thirty? Seven-thirty. What has got into you? What happened to you over there? Nothing has happened to me. I warned you Friday. This is Monday. It's my growing conviction that if we follow our strategy on West Africa .. And stick to costs and hold off our real demand until the end .. We'll not only lose out on control, but we'll be out of the deal entirely. Mr Salt, these people have pride. Sure, they'd be stupid to pass up Amalgamated but .. Sometimes one has to be stupid. Necessarily stupid. Stupid. Look, I am simply saying that in my best judgment I've got to tell them now. Now, I know human nature better than you do and I .. Don't interrupt me. Look. I think I know best. There's a great deal at stake and you agreed with this strategy. Now, stick to costs. Joanie sends her love. You are sure of these costs? Well, in the Labrador operation which I describe. Even when we had to deal with permafrost we came out under thirty cents a yard. You know they will make more money for us than we can for ourselves. It is astonishing. Let's go. - Yes, sir. What have you been doing since Saturday? She can work a slide rule. I never knew a woman before who could work a slide rule. Who? - Berta. Berta? The girl Chutwell introduced me to. You won't believe this Cliff but .. I spent the whole weekend talking. Me. Talking. Except when she was singing. She doesn't talk, Cliff. She sings. Bless. For two whole days I have been Thomas Alverdas. I have been Rutherford and Newton. Marconi and Einstein all rolled into one. Why do things like this have to happen to people? Too late. How many, sir? Six dozen please. You know. I was thinking Mr Barton that I've never been so impressed with a negotiation. Tomorrow, would you say we should .. Wrap it up? We should wrap it up. Good. Oh. Sorry. Wrong button. I brought four policemen. Go away. I've no place to go. I don't want to see you. I am deeply offended by the flowers. Why? Don't you like flowers? How can you waste such money? I have sent them all back. Oh, I am sorry. They were so pretty. I am not opening the door. Now go away. I don't want to. Please. What happened to us last Saturday .. It is dangerous. It is no good. And because it happened it does not mean .. Please go away. Are you still there? - Sure. What are you doing? I am fine. I am happy. But don't you have a picture of yourself that you could slide under the door .. And I can look at while I am waiting? No, no. Never mind. I see you fine now through this crack in the door. Fine. I bet the florist wouldn't take those flowers back but they do look lovely. Barbarian. That dress is really becoming. How dare he mention .. You look marvelous just the way you are. If we have dinner in Chelsea you won't have to change. I am not coming. Well, it was only to say goodbye. What do you mean? I am going back to New York. Maybe Thursday. So? Well, dreadful as you are .. I wish you well in New York. Fun and games. - Thank you. I'll wait on the stairs while you get your coat. I'm not getting my coat. I thought I was telling you goodbye. That was all changed. I don't like that monument. It is a pity. The one square in London that I do not like and that it should be mine. Are you crazy always like this in New York? No. Well, it is nice to know that you don't sit on monuments and .. Peek at your wife through doors. I have no wife. You are insufferable. Do you never tell people you have no wife until .. It makes a difference to you? No. No! If you would sit still for a minute I would ask you to marry me. This is truly madness. How can you amount to anything? And be so crazy? - That's my problem. I will say that I love you. But it is wrong. What do you know of me? Where I came from? What I was in the war? And the concentration camp in Vienna. I am in love with a woman, not a history book. Oh, Cliff. I am so wrong for you. Don't you know it? You must marry some girl who is .. Sweet and presentable and will always say yes. I am engaged to that girl. We were to be married by Saturday night. The night we went to Claridge's. I am very fond of her. She doesn't know that I will never marry her. That is, whether you marry me or not. Oh, my darling. Do you not understand? That I am so afraid of you. Of course I do. There is nothing to terrible as thinking. But for tonight I advise it. For both of us. - I've done my thinking. I doubt that. But at any rate, tomorrow night you will be in your room. All starched and pretty. And if it's a nice evening I shall wear a gown. Which will show me off to you. And at 8 o'clock you will have ordered champagne. And a lovely pheasant. And don't please be worried. For I shall be there. This will do. I had certain apprehensions when you suggested coming here alone. But I see you and my apprehensions disappear. Well, that's a pity because they are justified. A sherry? Please. Do go on because you see .. My heart has stopped beating. Since we've reached a figure which we can mutually agree .. Represented minimum costs and minimum financing I have checked with New York. It is our decision that the risk does not justify such an investment. If we are to assume such a risk we must have commensurate authority. Control of the joint corporation must go to Amalgamated .. With 52% of the stock in our treasury and myself as chairman. Well, my .. Heart is beating again but that is about all I can say for it. Thank you. What is your opinion Mr Barton of these demands? When I left New York I considered them quite in order. You knew of these proposals when we entered negotiations? I did. I am afraid I am taking this rather badly. Sorry. Do you consider the proposals at this point in the negotiations are in order? I am representing Amalgamated World Metals. Not Carew Limited. I shall somehow resist the considerable temptation to jump off Waterloo bridge. We are not bent on suicide over here, Mr Barton. If we have learnt anything in our fairly long experience it is that the proud .. May sometimes seem foolish. But they die last. I reject your proposals of course and terminate the negotiations which I'll .. File away among my more unsavoury recollections. Well, if you have finished your sherry. No. Well, that's naturally what I expected, Mr Carew. And I am .. Grateful to escape with my life. I wonder if you and Mr Pitt-Semphill can come to New York in a few days or so. You will have to soon to see some competitor. I want nothing more than to take up right where we were a few minutes ago. I cannot promise anything. My relations with Mr Salt may be compromised by .. Another factor. But I can't believe that Amalgamated in the end will pass up such a .. Golden egg simply because it can't have the upper hand. Bring me another sherry. You know. At a time like this I wish I had a taste for bourbon. [ Door knocks ] Come in. If I live to a thousand I shall never forget you. But I cannot marry you. These English. Their poets have such a way of saying things. What was it? 'I could not love thee dear so much, loved I not honour more'. There must always be something more than love, Cliff. Or love is bankrupt. With me it is my identity. Yes. 'This stupid little treasure'. 'That whatever I am, to this I shall be true'. That little identity. They are protected by the most ridiculous actions. One tyranny after another. This I should lose. A splendid terrifying, overwhelming American. The wife of someone as splendid and terrifying as you. What honestly do you know about America? I knew you would have some asinine objections .. So I tried to get you a seat on my plane for tomorrow. I am not coming. That's right. You haven't a visa. That I'll attend to first thing in New York. Cliff, stop overwhelming me. Anybody who can overwhelm you deserves it. You'll come to New York in a few days .. Look around, find out what a sublime idiot you are, and marry me. Stop it please. You won't have money so I went to that bank on the corner near your office .. And deposited a thousand dollars in your name. You'll say 'no' when I get on the plane tomorrow. You'll say 'no' the next day. But in the end, you will come Miriam because .. Anything else would be too absurd. Because you love me. Because I love you. Cliff, I have said what would happen to me. I haven't even said what would happen to you. Would it be too overwhelming to suggest there is some cold pheasant waiting? Some warm champagne? How are you, Mr Barton. Glad to see you back. Thanks. Grab those bags will you. - Right. Have someone take these things over to my apartment. Telephone Mrs Everett. Tell her Lester has been delayed. He'll be coming on in a few days with Mr Carew. Make an appointment with a good visa lawyer. And get me a date with somebody from Steinways about buying a piano. Have them send a man round with paper cut-outs so we can decide on size. Don't tell me you are taking piano lessons? Send a cable to Mrs Miriam Linka, Number 4 Sullivan Square, London. To say: 'No nonsense, please'. And sign it 'Cliff'. [ Telephone ] Yes? Oh. Thank you. Miss Salt is still in North Hampton. They don't know when she's coming in. Shall I put a call through to her? Good morning. Come in to my office, Cliff. What fell on you over there I will never know. You look the same. Nothing 'fell' on me. I saw what Carew was like. That's all. I tried to warn you what would happen. And, as I cabled .. it happened. They'll be coming over shortly. It will be good for you to meet Carew and see for yourself. You mean I will have to put over myself what you couldn't? I'd like to show you something. Fred Delehanty and his boys have been working 18 hours a day. If you saw anything like this in London .. Tell me. Well? Did you see anything like this in London? The West African mine. Well, I will ask you once more. No. I saw nothing like it in London. It is perfect. Except for one detail. What happened to you, Cliff? I've gambled everything on you. Amalgamated represents my life. I have nothing else. No children. There is Joanie of course. But I've given her to you. I thought that I'd .. Create another man in my own likeness to inherit what I have and what I am. This isn't just the matter of a deal, won or lost. I'll win it. What counts Cliff is that .. Well, I have no-one but you. We've been together for so many years and now suddenly you have .. Can't we just see this as a difference of opinion? We've had them before. We agreed on a certain strategy. We came up against something we didn't anticipate. I changed my opinion in view of new necessities. What necessities? Pride. What is to do about pride? I have pride. Then the necessity of leaving room for the next man's. What happened to you, Cliff? Look. Let's take this up later. I haven't been home. I need a shower. I have a few errands. Assuming there is no security problem .. I don't see why she shouldn't be given a visitor's visa. There should be no real delay. Three months. Three months? But I want to marry her. Next week, if she'll come. You didn't say you wanted to marry her. This brings up another problem. If she's coming here for the purpose of marriage .. Then naturally, she'll have to wait for an immigrant's visa. Who do I see in Washington? Mr Barton. I assume that you know the right people, but be careful. These days things are touchy. Swing too much weight and you will .. - Thank you. Fine. Can do. Goodbye. Brother Howie. - Brother Cliff. Good old Yale. Fifteen years. What do you want? - It's a long story. Make it as harrowing as possible. - I am in love. That is too harrowing. Her name is Mrs Miriam Linka and you're too dull a bureaucrat to appreciate her. But .. if she'll have me I want to marry her. I need to know what to do. At your age, what a question. - No. I mean there are problems. An Austrian citizen living in London with an IRO passport. Can't you go to London, marry her there and then she'd acquire non-quota status? I can't go to London. I want to marry her next week. And why in all that's holy can't I marry her in my own country? This isn't a problem. This is an international incident. Got any ideas? - Certainly. Amputate both legs. And apply for an act of grace because you can't travel. This isn't funny. Brother Barton. Boy, it certainly hits you middle-aged Bennies like a ton of bricks. Wait until I tell my wife. She is romantic. Here, take a drink of water. Now. Is there any possibility of communist affiliations past or present? That is impossible. - What about Mister Linka? He was killed in 1945 in the Austrian resistance. There, you see. He could have been a red. Howie, we're talking about the woman I want to marry. You don't just ask .. I understand. The question is, when I am called to a congressional committee .. Will they understand? A few more days like this and I will turn into a red. Please, you are in Washington, pal. Cliff, how about this? I can get her a visitor's visa. She states her intention to leave for a foreign country. Alright. She comes to New York. You fly her down to Mexico City, get married and 'voila'. Howard Carruthers for president. No, thank you. Just save me a floor at Rockefeller center. There is one thing though. I'll have to be covered. I need a letter. - Nothing easier. Some letter stating that the US economy will collapse if you leave the country. Making passing reference to your heroic war deeds. And ending in some hymn of praise for the lady's qualifications. Preferably in the manner of a Shakespearian sonnet. I'll write that in my sleep. - Not you. Sorry. It will have to come from the chairman. That is George Salt, isn't it? You can get it, can't you? Of course. Brother Howie, I'll never forget this. My boy, it is nothing. Your government, and it is your government. Takes a paternal interest in the welfare of all large taxpayers. I'll see you. So, we met. She made me furious. I took her out to dinner. I suppose, to see if I could make her act like a human being. Before I knew it, I was wondering if I had ever acted like a human being. She sounds wonderful. You are killing me. There's something about it that just turned me upside down. It made me question everything I'd ever done or ever will do. Where I wind up with your uncle, I don't know. I hope you beat him to a pulp. Joanie, I love her. Sure. I've acted like a heel most of my life and didn't know it. Would you believe me? This time I know it. You are not acting like a heel. You are such a square. If you think you are breaking my heart you are crazy. You always bored me stiff. Don't you know it? You never knew what to say to me except how cute I was. There was nothing else to say. I didn't know what to say to you. You didn't want to marry me. And I didn't want to marry you. I used to feel like somebody engaged to the Grand Coulee Dam. When I was little .. I always dreamed of a fellow with curly hair who played in a band. I don't mean that I don't love you, Cliff. Because I do in a way, but .. Oh boy, am I happy. Funny. You know, this is the first time I ever really wanted you. But .. are you going to be in a jam with uncle George. Carew arrives tomorrow from London and I'll handle the negotiations my own way. I'd be grateful if you stay out of the picture. Go out of town, It might be a good time for you and Joanie to get married. You'd save face that way. And Joanie has been very disappointed. What's this? A letter to a man named Carruthers in the State Department. I've drawn it up for our signature. It's self-explanatory, I believe. I think it covers everything except that .. I love her. Well, have you seen Joanie? Joanie asked me to tell you that I've made her the happiest girl in the world. You are lying. Call her. It was a wrong idea, Joanie and I. I don't care what Joanie thinks. Not a bit. All I know is that by marrying Joanie you were doing the right thing. And this? I care about you. If you care about me then .. - Is this what happened in London? Is it? Yes. For the most part it is. Is this all you know about her on this page? What one can write down which isn't much. 'Age. Maiden name'. 'Where she was born'. Don't you know? Or did you forget to write it down? I don't know. You don't know. She plays the piano. At least you know something about her. What does your father think about this? - I haven't told him. I've had no time to see him. I resent .. What does your man Carew think of her? - He didn't meet her. And why not? Mr Salt, I was in London exactly 7 days. - You were there long enough for this. Or was 30 minutes long enough for this? Don't say something we can't forget. Can I forget Cliff, that you and all you mean to me want to marry .. A stateless, placeless, nameless refugee out of central Europe? Someone I must guarantee before your own government will permit into the country. That's a technicality. It's a technicality, I suppose .. That this same woman in the space of a few days has infected you .. With ideas radical and foreign. Ideas antagonistic to your company's interests. And let us say it, Cliff. To the interests of your country. I seem to be having a nightmare. How else can you figure it? Will Guy Eliot see it differently? Or any director? We used an unprincipled strategy to back up an unjustified demand. Because I have objected .. Are you going call it disloyalty and tag it on to Miriam? What was the one detail you objected to? Cliff. I never expected to be saying to you. 'Go easy, be careful'. 'Know what you are doing'. This comes hard son, but .. I am no revolutionary character. I don't have what it takes. And my only excuse is that it takes a great deal. That doesn't mean I am not the first to say to the next fellow: 'Go ahead, stick your neck out'. 'Go in and get killed'. Count on me son to deliver a magnificent eulogy .. Over your bruised and battered body. All I want to do is get married. You think. Excuse me. [ Telephone ] Yes? Oh yes. That's good. I'll tell him. Yes. That was Salt. He preferred not to talk to you. He says to tell you that he has signed your letter and mailed it. And he does it under protest. All I can say is she had better be good looking. Ah, the good old USA. Eh? Thank you. You understand Mr Salt, my consternation in London when I heard of this proposal. I must say that it was only because of my continued confidence in Mr Barton .. Let me tell you something, Mr Carew. Cliff is the greatest we've got but something happened to him in London. I don't know what He wasn't supposed to hold back that proposal. I he never been so distressed. I am distressed that he is not here. It seems rather unfair. It is unfair but frankly I didn't want him here. I wanted to make a clean start with you. Whatever happened to him in London I will never know. He seems to have had his mind on something else. I'm sorry. No, no, sir. No telling tales out of school, but I just had to laugh. 'His mind on something else'. Now that's very acute of you, Mr Salt. You know about Mrs Linka? I am sorry. I thought you didn't know. Chutwell. If this is some private concern of Mr Barton's .. Please. Have you met Mrs Linka? - Oh, have I met her? Why, any gentleman let us say, lonely and unattached .. Just naturally comes to meet Mrs Linka. Chutwell, I forbid .. If you excuse me saying so Mr Carew, since Mr Salt is aware of the situation. Well, I am not so aware. I refuse to listen to .. Your own man is confirming what I have been trying to find out. I know my facts concerning Mr Barton, sir. But he is one thing with you and another with me. And who knows what he is with a woman who is a commie if ever I saw one. Why you .. - No! Mr Carew .. - I will speak to you later. I find this extremely unpleasant. Mr Salt, I see no purpose in extending our conversation. You will excuse me. Chutwell. Good evening. Please hold that call, will you. Just a few minutes. Thank you. What was it that told me, Cliff? You know I had scarcely read her name in your letter .. Before something told me what could happen. What could happen? I sent that letter to the State Department in good faith. Under protest but in good faith. You know what I am talking about. - I do not know. Chutwell. In Eliot's presence and Carew's presence has described your Mrs Linka .. Somewhat more frankly. You don't have to tell me what he said. I am quite sure I know. How could you do this to me, Cliff? - Chutwell lied to you. Who in heaven would believe a man like Chutwell? Carew knows what he's like. Carew has cut off all conversation. Because of you the deal is off. I don't believe it. - Eliot was there. Nobody asked me. Nobody so much as picked up a telephone and called and asked me, is this true. When a woman with a history like hers is called .. Both a prostitute and a communist what can you say? How could you disprove it? According to our corporate by-laws, Cliff .. The board of directors must act on the resignation of the vice chairman. I am calling a meeting for Friday. I have not resigned. But you will. And if you don't. Do I have any choice but to do my duty and ask the board of directors .. To discharge you and give them my reasons? Literally, destroy you. It is beneath you to call this 'duty'. I apologise. 'Duty' is a lie. Even I must flatter myself sometimes. 'Duty' is a pompous illusion implying choice when there is no choice. I am a creature of power. I pursue it totally and I obey it totally. You pursue it partially. And so you fail, and in failing you are a threat to me. Now. Either resign Cliff, or I must destroy you. I am submitting no resignation. Any time. Any time between now and Friday. [ Telephone ] Yes? Yes. Go ahead. Miriam. Liebling, I am so stupid. There is some little delay and I sit here trembling. It was nothing. It was nothing. I am fine. I am wonderful. The best of all possible worlds. Talk a very long time. I will not talk a long time. It is too expensive. I only want to say this. That you were right. And I have told myself a thousand times 'no'. And now I say 'yes'. And I have your money and I have the visa. And I shall see you at that airport with the funny name. I love you. I only said I love you. Then I shall see you Wednesday. Go away, my love. Go away. Goodnight. If she finds out what is happening she will take the next plane back to London. I feel like somebody had his hand in my stomach. It will be alright. I have been handling situations since before you were born. I think I should tell you in so many words .. What it means to rediscover one's father. Okay. Now let's see what you've got. So you see, Presbyterian or not. Michael Servetus or not and I told you my father had no hand in it. I adore him. He'll drop your things by the hotel. I just wanted you to see where I live. To see if meets with your disapproval. Miriam, you are so beautiful. I had forgotten. You got off the plane and I remembered everything except how beautiful you are. Cliff, what is it? What's what? When a man says twice that a woman is beautiful he is very troubled. Or very much bored. - Now Miriam, that isn't fair. Oh Cliff, this being in love. It is like such a terrible searchlight. One sees so much. Too much. What is it, darling? Whatever it is, we forget it. This is where you live. I expected to find it like in Hollywood movies, a fishbowl. I am sorry. I was .. I'm just not used to being in love like this. It's a little hard on the nerves. What is this? A piano. A piano? Oh. I love you. There is nothing else I suppose to say, for all I want is you. And twelve crazy American children. And what happens to Mrs Linka? Who cares? I was walking past Rockefeller Center this morning. And I almost came up to your office. Here? - Uhuh. But I didn't of course. It wouldn't be proper. Well, look who is here. Miriam, it is .. It's too crowded here. - No. It is enchanting. It is so American. I can see everybody's feet. They can see mine. I love this. Who is that man over there staring at you? Slocum. Dan Slocum. You know everybody, don't you. He looks awful. Who is he? - He is a competitor. Oh. That is why he makes you look so grumpy. Cliff, I adore America already. Do you know the other man? He looks so British. I used to know him quite well. Just what happened over at Amalgamated? I really know nothing about it. - Come on, you can tell me. It was your deal he lost. - Who? Mr hot-shot. Cliff Barton. My reasons for ending negotiations with Amalgamated .. Had nothing to do with Mr Barton. Are you kidding? They're having a board of directors meeting tomorrow. I understand they're going to give him the old heave-ho. What? Come on. Let's have some fun. Darling, what is it? - Nothing at all. Dan. - Hi. Mr Slocum, Mr Carew - Mrs Linka. Mrs Linka. How goes it, Cliff? - Well enough. I hear you are having a board of directors meeting tomorrow. Anything special? - Not that I know of. That is not what I heard. See you around old boy. Mrs Linka. Cigars? Will you call me please at Regency House. I am going there at once. Mrs Linka. How about a cigar? It was Mr Carew you were seeing in London wasn't it? Or that you should have seen in London but instead you were always seeing me. And now it is for Mr Slocum who is your competitor .. That Mr Carew gets all the attention he didn't get from you. Miriam, nothing of the sort. - There is something, Tell me. Darling, believe me. Mr Chutwell's comment was bad enough, Mr Barton. But that Mr Salt should have interpreted my actions as a reflection on you. What are you going to do? You cannot resign. You've met Mrs Linka. It is abominable. You will have to believe this. Whether I lose out at Amalgamated no longer concerns me. Only, I have to lose everything. Mrs Linka doesn't know? - Not yet. Mr Barton. Will you go to Mr Guy Eliot today. Now. And tell him all that I have told you. Tell him also. That I have made no commitments regarding our West African concessions. Either to Mr Slocum or to anybody else. Nor do I intend to. Until I have learnt what is going to happen to you. Let me out here, driver. - Yes, sir. Sorry you had to wait so long. - Alright, sir. Glad you came by. I want to talk to you. - I've been seeing Carew. I didn't like the way George handled things the other night. He lied about you, I am reasonably sure. It wasn't your idea was it, holding back on the control proposal? No. He said it was. Well, I have nothing against lying. I lie all the time. But you could see that Carew didn't believe him. And old George was just losing ground. There were a lot of things I didn't like. We should have had you there. A bad affect on a man like Carew. Besides, it is weak. Very weak. In my opinion you should have been given a free hand with Carew. This way we come out with nothing. A bad financial loss. And I have an extreme prejudice against bad financial losses. Carew asked me to tell you .. I'm sure you could deliver Carew tomorrow. Now we have a couple of problems. George is a stubborn old goat. He is still chairman. Today anyway. Say that again. Look Barton, anything can happen tomorrow. Anything. You understand? I understand. Alright. Now the other problem. I am going to ask you two questions. This woman George tells me you want to marry. Are you satisfied there's nothing subversive about her? She's never been a communist or anything like that? I am so satisfied. Have you investigated her? I have not. That's all. Mrs Linka. Mrs Miriam Linka please. 1219. - Thank you. Mrs Salt, I am .. A devious, ruthless and quite untrustworthy woman. When I say on the telephone: 'Come. We shall talk about refugees'. I am lying in my teeth. I did not intend that we talk about refugees. Neither did I. What is it? Cliff? Mrs Salt, what is it? You don't know? You don't know about the accusations brought against you? Accusations? Mrs Linka, I came here .. To ask that you insist he resign. Don't you know that Mr Salt asked for his resignation? I did not. I am .. Mrs Salt .. I don't intend to repeat the accusations. They are of a nature both political and moral. I don't consider them responsible myself but they needn't be these days. Mrs Salt. Besides that, the circumstances of your life make it quite impossible .. For you to answer the charges. So their nature is of no importance. I do not believe you and I will not believe you. I told you. Mr Salt has requested Cliff's resignation. He hadn't received it at noon today. If Mr Salt does not receive his resignation tomorrow .. That will be all for cliff. And for you. How I admire Cliff. How he has not told you. How much he must love you. Take him. Make him resign. Get him out of New York. Out of great business. Out of this society of power. Take him away while you are still beautiful and young together. Take him to some neglected corner of the earth where .. Private values still have some meaning. Mrs Salt. There is no private life. Not here. Not for a man that matters. No love, no inward rightness. There is only public relations and public necessities. I married a man whom I loved very deeply. And who I believed loved me. Now we are just two old stone lions. Staring into eternity on the library steps. My god. I have substituted charities for love. Meetings for marriage. I have built great organisations on the sound foundation of utter loneliness. Take him. Make him resign. If you love him. How terribly you must love him still. I didn't .. I was speaking for your sake. That is .. Why I was so grateful when you called this morning. You would not speak aloud such prideful, private things .. For the sake of some strange Mrs Linka whom you have never met. Or for even Cliff. No. You are afraid that .. Cliff will fight. You are in fear for your husband. Who else would you so protect? But it is so fine of you. Mrs Salt. I love Cliff. And if he can win .. How can I tell him? - He can't win. He's destroyed himself already by his love for you. He may not know it. He is young. My husband is not. He has to do this thing to Cliff tomorrow. I believe it will kill him. You see, he loves Cliff. He loves no-one else on earth. I wonder. I've tried to reach Mrs Linka on the house phone since 5 o'clock. You haven't seen her? - No, sir. She was up there around 3:30 when a Mrs George Salt came. I am sorry Mr Barton by we have no Mrs Linka on tonight's plane. No. Nor tomorrow. Cliff. Why don't you go back to your apartment and get some rest. I don't need any rest. I will .. I'm sorry, dad. I will .. I'll make a few more calls. I thought I was too late. You saw Mrs Salt. I saw Mrs Salt. You'll be glad to know then that I resigned this afternoon. I am out of Amalgamated. You won't have to worry about being married to an American businessman. We'll leave for London in a few days. I am only sorry about the piano if you like it. It's a little big to take along. If anybody is going to leave for London .. It is I .. and I will go alone. You don't seem to understand that I am in love with your country. Perhaps more than any of you. But you Mrs Salt. Didn't she tell you? It's not easy to horrify a woman who has seen residence in concentration camps. I am still in love with your country. Well, we are leaving. In one family, Cliff. There is room for only one refugee. Oh, Cliff. I have run. I have run and run. And but for the grace of god and you I would be running still. No. There can't be two refugees. Not in one family. You mustn't run. You mustn't. I will read his letter of resignation and ask for a motion. It is just possible that some of those jokers may start raising the game. Then you make a motion of acceptance. That will hold them. Cliff. Shall we go in? Just what I was telling you, Guy. The deceiving, the going behind my back. You gave me that resignation yesterday .. Even though you knew that today, five minutes before we're to go in there .. I did not know. My father predicted this, Mr Salt. That I would start out wanting a wife of my choice. In the end it would take a crusade. It's a hard choice. It has taken me this long. Do you know what I'll do to you because I have to? Because I have to. Mr Salt. I don't believe you run Amalgamated in the company's best interests. You are losing me. You have lost Carew. I did not lose Carew. - George. Do you mind? I'll demonstrate that you did. I'll demonstrate that when power comes to exist for itself alone it .. Becomes a losing proposition. That when you leave no room for men, your enemies or your friends .. When you can no longer recognise the dignity of plain human beings .. It's because you are weak not because you are strong. I will attack you Mr Salt because I must. We do what we must do despite all consequences .. And in that you are right and in nothing else. It is total power, not duty that is the world's illusion. Shall we go in? Cliff. I am going to ask you in there what I asked you yesterday. That is why you resigned, isn't it? This woman that you are going to marry. Are you satisfied there is nothing subversive about her? I am so satisfied. Have you investigated her? - I have not. Well, I have. I got this yesterday. The army kept a file on her ever since she left a certain concentration camp. Read your file to somebody else. I am marrying a woman, not a set of statistics. Go and total your indecent little 2s and 2s Mr Eliot and prove whatever you like. But this is a woman I love. And there is no arithmetic this side of heaven I will listen to. You will excuse me. - You will listen. Because I don't like what I am doing any more than you do. And because I am not trying to prove anything about Mrs Linka. I am proving something about you. I am not to going to read all this. It is too almighty long. When she came back to Vienna, she didn't have a nickel. Husband dead. She took a job in some nightclub playing the piano. She was supposed to 'entertain' our officers. She wouldn't. She quit. The Russians heard about it. And offered her big money to go back and work with our fellows. No entertaining. Just conversation. And report back to them what she heard. She wouldn't be bought. She reported back to our side and we said: fine, take the job. We'll double the money and you tell us what the Russians say. She told us where we could go. George, it isn't that you've made a fool of yourself. That has got nothing to do with it. It is that I asked this fellow twice. If he had investigated her. And twice, knowing what it would mean if he said no. Twice. Just the same, that's what he said: No. And I used to think you would sell your grandmother to get ahead. Well, I would like it understood that .. If the board fails to act on his resignation then it must act on mine. That is fine, George. Because I'd like to see him have your job. George, I want to ask you something. Your system. How is it going to turn out anything but vice presidents? Fellows who look alike, think alike. Afraid of their jobs. Never say no. Where are the presidents coming from? Fellows who say what the think and mean what they say. Where are they coming from? Out of a race of vice presidents? I hate to say this to you, George. But you've had it. We need a chairman. We've got one right here. Are we going to let him get away? Let's go in. For reasons of health, gentlemen .. I must ask you to accept my resignation as your chairman. The time comes for all of us. With your approval .. I propose. As my successor, your Vice Chairman. Mister Barton. I ask for a motion. So moved. Seconded. Who is in favor? - Aye. Opposed? The motion is carried. Thank you, gentlemen. That is all. Congratulations, Cliff. Walk out with me, Cliff. Keep up appearances. Congratulations, Cliff. Cliff. Would you like your car, Mr Salt? [ Whistle ] I always knew that someday you would do something to show me who is boss. You sure did it, didn't you. Now you must sit up there with yourself, taking the rap and deciding what's what. And someday. Someone will come along and show you who is the boss, and then you'll be like me. You'll be wondering what did I do that was wrong and .. Where do I go .. From here? Here you are, Mr Salt. George. Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye and good luck. I've chartered this plane. We're back the first of the week. Goodbye. - This won't take long. Oh, you! By the first of the week? By the time I am done with you they will be citizens. 0h, no! A piano. You did it, you did it! ?.r0s.?
