The attackers came closer and closer with roaring engines. King Kong had him in his claws. He climbed higher and higher with him. To the highest top in New York. Headfirst he hung in his paw. Then he dropped him. Facing certain death, his rescue approached. The wings of a plane. The pilot flew a loop, right towards King Kong. Confident that he'll defeat the horrible monstrosity. Excuse me? Do you want some ice cream? Did you really get ice cream? I'm sorry, I don't understand you. You have to speak English. Dad, I'm really not in the mood for school anymore. Do you want chocolate or lemon? Chocolate. Please. Really funny, dad. Delicious. FOR LITTLE ROLF They'll have ice cream at mum's, right? I mean, real ice cream. In New York? They have truckloads of ice cream. Forget it, even freighttrains full of ice cream. Hey, that's mine! Just you wait! You won't get me! THE PATH Good or bad? - She's one of the good ones. - Why? She looks nice and she's reading. I think so, too. And her? Good or bad? It's way easier when people are dressed. Yes. And more boring. So? I'll say: Bad. I wouldn't be sure about that. You just think she's pretty. By the way, I now know how we'll finally get away from here. We'll take the train to the Spanish-French border, walk across the Pyrenees to Spain, then to Portugal and a boat in Lisbon will take us to NY. Yes, Sir. Get the stick. - Hey. - Good or bad? Good? Bad. Seriously bad. High time to leave. Hello. - Hello. - Hello, Monsieur Ludwig. - How are you? - Fine, what do you want? Two lemonades, please. - A small Pastis... - No, thanks. Mum? How are you? I'm fine. Don't move. You neither. Dad, do they have croissants? Don't move! And no, of course they don't have croissants. Just like yesterday. They didn't have any the day before yesterday, either. Hey, don't look. One day they'll have them again. Et... ...voilà. For you. Well drawn, Anna. Not at all. You should know, the lady who drew this stunning portrait of you was a famous artist in Berlin. "Was". Now I create different, great art. Permit to enter and transit visa for Spain and Portugal. What do I owe you? Nothing. It's for free. The next passport will be for myself. Then we'll be gone as well. Be careful! Swoop! No! Adi! Everyone stay here! Get your documents out! Rolf, come! Dad! Documents! Go! The documents! Come! Down! Hurry! - This will be tight. - Your son invited me. Be quiet, Adi. What are you cooking? Fish soup. Very good. May I? Look at that. Your fire's out. Your documents, please. Departure! Everyone, gather in front of the entrance. Alright. Today is your lucky day. Come. Well done, Adi. What about me? Thanks. I really hope we'll meet again. I hope so, too. Maybe in New York. Adi, stop! - Do we have to take it along as well? - Yes. Like a car can't drive without fuel, I need cognac to write. Maybe Hitler isn't looking for you anymore. Maybe he forgot what you wrote about him in the news. It's possible, right? We're on a list. The Nazis don't forget anyone who's on a list. - To be precise, we're on two lists. - Why is that? The first list is the Nazis'. The list with everyone they want to arrest. It could get us into one of their camps. The second one is the Americans'. The list with everyone they want to get out of Europe, so the Nazis don't put them into their camps. - And we're on both. - Amongst the top ten? Let me put it this way: Neither Hitler, nor the American President have sleepless nights because of us. Yet they want to have us. I miss mum. So do I. I want to sleep! I'll call the police! Can you keep a secret? - Yes, Sir. I can keep a secret. - Very good. This is the only object of value we've got left. - It's a... - ...diamond. Yes. Everything we owned is in it now. You mustn't tell anyone about the diamond. Rolf! Hey, promise! I promise. Good. This is our ticket to America. Now brush your teeth and go to bed. Documents. - Documents. - Sure. I see. We have a stowaway. Hello. Adi, don't! - Stop! - Adi? "Adi" like "Adolf"? No. - Have a good journey. - Thanks. Good or bad? Somewhere in the world there's a little bit of luck. And I dream of it all the time. Somewhere in the world, there's a little bit of bliss. And I've been dreaming of it for a long, long time... Hello. You mustn't travel with heavy luggage. No suitcases, no backpacks, you'd attract attention. What about our stuff? We'll send them after you, as soon as possible. You'll get flour bags for the most necessary. Always stay inconspicuous. Luisa made you some... What? Everyone wears them here. Núri will guide you. I thought you'd take us there. Who's Núri? In about four hours, you'll reach the peak. You'll already be in Spain then. Then you can only go downhill and two hours later you'll be in Portbou. If everything goes well. What could go wrong? Who is that Núri? Núri! - A child? - A girl? Núria is less conspicuous than if we came along. She knows her way around in the mountains. Can she manage the path? Yes. What about you? You speak German? I taught her since she's been with us. You can trust her. What do you parents say about that? Nothing. They're dead. Shot in Guerra Civil. I'm sorry. The money. Please. More wine? Yes. Do you know this one? Hitler goes to a fortuneteller and wants to know when he'll die. She says: My Fuhrer, you'll die on a feast day. Hitler asks: Which one? She says: Doesn't matter. The day you'll die will be a feast day. - Salut. - Salut. Will the dog come along? - Of course. - No. Impossible. Núri is right. What if the dog barks at the wrong moment? - Adi won't bark at the wrong moment. - Adi? Adi, be quiet. We can't risk it. - What? But I promised mum. - And I promised her to get you to her safely. We'll take good care of him. I promise. I won't leave without Adi. The dog will stay here. Come, Adi. I should go after him. You can bring us the dog tomorrow morning, before you leave. Lately German patrols have been marching in the mountains as well. - Germans? - Yes. Be careful. Excuse me, Sir? Do you know where I can find ice cream? A big ice cream. Like the Statue of Liberty. It's for my son. Rolf. It's simply too dangerous to take him along. Please understand. You promised, dad. You promised. Adi, I've got something nice for you. Hurry up, she's probably already waiting for us. - Who? - The girl. You said one shouldn't let women wait. That's true. Where is Adi? While you slept, I already took him to the people. I thought I should get it over with. You're quite brave, big boy. Theo said: Don't attract attention. Should I go naked? What's in bag? Why is it this big? In the bag, not just bag. I'll leave you here. A book and a heavy sweater, in case it gets cold in the mountains. We'll walk, we won't get cold. Come. Is everything alright? Sure, dad. - Dear God. - It's fine. Come! What a great day for a hike. Yes, that's what we said as well. A great day, the area is wonderful. Very calm. Yes, it's a calm area. I hope it'll stay that way. There are more people in the south west. Your fellow countrymen. They can't be bribed with cigarettes. Come. Núria. I have information for you. What is it? Not your problem. Come. I don't need a break. - Drink. - Can one really drink this? I mean, because it's not from a bottle, but from the ground. I didn't hear anything. There was something. I heard it as well. It's from the bag. What? Since when can a bag make sounds? Adi? Dammit. Dad, I'm sorry. I promised mum. - Rolf... - We won't make it to the other side. No! The dog won't be harmed. We'll leash the dog. I'll take it with me when I go back. Wolves will come and eat him. Idiot. It's only a dog. A dog is a being like us as well. I can't leave Adi alone here. The dog will come along. No. Too much of a risk. The dog will come along. Come here. Mum will be so glad to see you again. What's wrong with him? He's hungover. Why is the dog hungover? Because of your cognac. Come! Come, come, come! It was a very expensive cognac. We'll soon be there. How much further is soon? You had to pick the path over the mountains, dad. Next time we'll take the subway. Or a nice Berlin double decker. What is it? Hurry! Hurry! Come on. Get down! Hurry! And be careful with the headwind. Sturmbannfuehrer, are those footprints? They're talking German. It's always nice to meet fellow countrymen abroad, right? That could be anything. Keep going. Adi, don't! There is someone! Be careful! Stop! Cease fire! Come! SS-Man Heinrich, get up there. The documents. You'll go ahead, I'll join you later. Rolf, I promise. Is anyone there? And always brush your teeth. You got that? I'll join you later, I promise. Promise that you'll bring Rolf to safety. Dad, don't! Hands up! Come here! Hello. I'm lucky to meet you, Sir. I was walking my dog. He ran away. He's in big trouble when I find him. Do you know how I... Shut up! - Stop! A lone rolling stone? What have we got here? Come along! Take him along! Come, get up there. Very nice of you to take me along. Ready for departure. Maybe we'll find my dog on the way. Thanks. I said that the dog isn't good. Dog... Drink. Come on. We're in Spain. Portbou's over there. That's where you need to go. You leave me alone? Wait! We could have saved him! Idiot! We'd be dead. You'd be dead. Your father would be dead. He isn't dead. I can't go on without him. He was arrested. Maybe he'll be set free, maybe not. He will be set free. He promised. Leave, get lost! Go! Throw it. I don't need you anyway. You're getting on my nerves. - You'll die if you go back. - Help me, please. We'll go to Foix. What? We'll go to Foix. If you look for your father, do so in Foix. If your father's set free, it's in Foix. He'll surely be set free. They can't know who he is. Where is that Foix? That way, behind the mountains. Come! Just a walk, right? This is good. Don't eat it, put it on your foot. Is your mother dead? What? No. She's waiting for us in New York. We were supposed to join her, but no more boats left from Marseille. In her last letter she wrote that she goes to the port every day to see whether we're on one of the boats. For how long? No idea. Until it gets dark. No, for how long has she been gone? Three years in December. It was never planned this way. Actually... This can't be true. Get lost! Get lost! It's all your fault! Stupid dog! - Damn! - Stop! It's not the dog's fault! It's your fault. You took him along. Adi. Go on and brush! Chewing on the brush doesn't help. - No matter how many problems you have... - ...always face them with clean teeth. What is that? Toothpaste. What do you brush your teeth with? Salt. Like everyone. You want to try it? - Better than salt? - Better. Hey! Wait, it's slippery. And deep. Once I'm in America with my mother and my father, we'll fly around the world together. Soon, all people will do that. Nonsense. What? Is that something to eat? Believe me, one day people will even fly to the moon. How much further is it to Foix? We'll soon be there. I need a pee. Why does the dog have Hitler's name? Because it's funny. - Funny? - Watch! Adi, play dead. Not funny. A friend of dad had the idea. No! Not good! It's itching and biting like hell! There's something in my pants! Ants! It's biting like hell! That's not funny. Here. Help me! Rolf! Help me! I've got you. I'm sorry. I didn't know that you can't swim. Friends? THE 35TH OF MAY What are you reading? The 35th of May. By Erich Kaestner. The 35th of May doesn't exist. Exactly. It's a day on which anything can happen. A boy of our age visits his uncle. They meet a horse that can talk and loves roller skating. - Roller skating? - Shoes with rolls underneath. Show me the pictures. That's Konrad. He has to write an essay about the South Sea. His uncle Ringelhuth suggests that it'd be best to travel there. So, together with the horse they get on their way and walk through a cabinet. - Through a cabinet? - In books, that's possible. And they travel through many different countries. In one they have phones that people can carry around. In another they have cars that drive on their own. The book is crazy.. In the South Sea, Konrad then meets a princess. Her name is Parsley. They're Germans. Don't stop. Erich Kaestner? For little Rolf. Are you Rolf? And you? - Do you speak Catalan? - And German and French. Are they real? So, not real. You want to go to America? Is it yours? What's its name? A... Albert. You can spend the night here. It's safer. You can have this back tomorrow. My name is Esther. Welcome to the Maquis. Are you hungry? British pilots. They got shot down in France. We get them to Spain so they can get back to England and fight against the Nazis. What was your father's name again? Ludwig Kirsch. He's a journalist. You know him? No, I don't know him. But I'll keep an eye out for him. Good night. Adi, leave the mouse alone. Come on, we want to go back. My name is Núria Armengol. Maria and Raúl Armengol are... ...your parents, right? You know my parents? What your parents do for us is very important. And very dangerous. I didn't know that they have a daughter. What is it? What's wrong? I thought... I thought they were dead. They want to protect you. The less you know, the better for you and them. Where can I find them? - I mustn't tell you. - Why not? Because it's too dangerous. I've always felt that they're still alive. I knew that it's a lie. I'd rather die than betray someone. A few days ago, French border guards told me that my parents were seen in Foix. Foix. Maybe you'll meet them there. Maybe. Everything is possible. You're probably right. In these times, everything is possible. - You listened in. - What? I couldn't have listened. I didn't understand anything. My mum and dad are alive. What? But you thought they were dead. Esther told me. They protected me by making me believe they're dead. That's mean. They lied to you. There. Cassiopeia. Don't always fidget with that thing. Otherwise it'll backfire. It's dad's knife. I didn't mean it. I'm glad for you. I didn't mean it. What? When I said that it's your fault. But... It was my fault. There are way more stars than in Berlin. What is behind them? Stars. And behind them? Even more stars. But what's behind them? What do you think? Ice cream. Run! What is that? Hurry! You have to go! Now! - Quickly! - Wait, my stuff! Go! Quick! - Rolf! - Adi! Go, Rolf! Núri! Núri, wait! Núri! That way! Three kilometres north, then west. Got it? Follow the tracks! Run! Good luck! Come, Adi. What are you doing? I read that in a book about scouts. That way one can hear when the locomotive comes. If loco comes, we'll hear it soon enough. If the locomotive comes. Then we'll hear it soon enough. If, then. If you keep being a smartass, then I'll only speak Catalan. Bravo, you can do it. Have you ever jumped onto a loco? - I... - There's the loco. What the hell? - It isn't here. - What? - The toothpaste is gone. - Let's go. The toothpaste is gone. Rolf? Impossible. I have to go back. I have to find it. - I have to go back. - Dammit. Rolf! - Alright. Let's go. - No. Come. No, it's your toothpaste. Okay. Promise that you'll take good care of him. In case something happens to me. Why is the toothpaste this important? I... My... I'll be right back. Such a nag. It's just me. Hurry! Got it. Come on, Adi. A horse really is handy. You don't say. We'll soon be there. Alright. See you. Look for a girlfriend. Or a boyfriend. Get down! Run, big boy. Adi! Adi! Quiet! Be quiet! Come! Maybe he's hiding over there. Stop shooting! They're only children. They're only children! That was seriously close. You're bleeding. Adi, come here. - He just doesn't listen to his name. - Focus here. - Get down. - Mum, stop moving. - Yes. - Adi, come. Shoot here. I'll never get used to that name. Dad, closer to mum. - Like this, photographer? - Next to mum. And please don't kiss. I'm too young for that. - I'll never give you away again. - Smile! Don't kiss! What smells so good? Snails. A delicacy. Don't move. If all German soldiers shoot this poorly, Hitler will surely lose the war. Tomorrow we can keep going. Do you think the soldiers looked for my father? It's possible, right? How does the story continue? This is what happened: Once they passed through the realm of the past, Konrad and Uncle Ringelhuth went to the wrong world. The wrong world? Everything is upside down there. The children are the adults and the adults are the children. That should be the real world. Yes. It really should be. Do you believe in God? No. Me neither. If he existed, how could he let happen what's going on on earth? But there is no God. No good one, no evil one. We're there. The man over there. I'd say he's good. Why? Because he has a book with him. There are bad books. There. He has a book and is bad. - That doesn't count. - Five to zero. I like the game, although it's stupid. - Why is it stupid? - Sometimes people are good and bad. Your father lied as well. - Excuse me? - He lied, just like my parents. - My father doesn't lie. - All adults lie. Your father knew that he wouldn't come. - But he promised. - So you'd survive, idiot. - I'm not an idiot. - You are. You're lying. He'll come. You said it yourself. I never said you'd find your father. I said... You're creating a story in your head. I know how much it hurts. But the soldiers in the forest. - If your father is set free, it's a miracle. - Miracles happen. You! Get lost! Quick! You go ahead, I'll join you later. I promise. All adults lie. Rolf, are you alright? I saw you running. You're bleeding. It's nothing. - Where is Núria? Is she safe? - Yes. I have to see her. I have news about her parents. Her mum and dad. Do you understand me? - Yes. - Get her to this address. Ask for the book "Utopia". Can you do that? You have to hurry, I'll see you there. Núri? Search Núri. Search! What a great sniffer dog. Holy Toledo! Núri. I didn't pray. I only tied my shoes. Whatever. Come on, we mustn't waste any time. Come. Out with the dog! - Adi, stop! - Adi? Is the dog called "Adi" like "Adolf"? That's cheeky. Fine. Do me a favour and get lost now. We're looking for a book. Dammit, I forgot the name. - So what? - Utopia. The book's name is Utopia. Well, why didn't you say so right away? Follow me downstairs. They were arrested the day before yesterday. They're in a little prison on the Spanish side. My parents were arrested. Did you hear from my father? No. But he's on a list of people the Nazis are looking for. But not at the very top, right? I'm afraid that doesn't matter. They probably brought him back to Germany. I'm sorry. Right now I can't do anything for him. But maybe we can help Núria. How? We need to pay to get them out. How much do we have? Not enough. Dammit! Is that enough? That's one hell of a diamond! That is a lot more than enough! I can't accept that. No. - You have to. - No. I swear I'll throw the diamond away if you don't take it. Stop! It could be split. There are two possibilities. It can be cut with a saw or a froe. Both have advantages and disadvantages. With the saw it takes a day. With the froe it's done quickly. We don't have all day. Alright. I got it. Alright. When splitting it, there's always the risk that the diamond shatters into thousands of splinters. Go for it. No! - Do it! - No! The risk is too high. Maybe I'll never see my father again, but I want you to see your parents again. So, do it! Mazel tov! Thanks. Thanks. Do you want some? It's good. It's cognac. Good Courvoisier. I hope none of you has had dinner yet. Otherwise all of us will get some of it. The Mueller's phone is ringing. The voice on the phone says: Sorry, I picked the wrong one. Mueller: All of us did. I've got one more: Hitler goes to a fortuneteller and wants to know when he'll die. She says: On a feast day. Hitler asks: Which one? She says: Doesn't matter. The day you die will be a feast day. Feast day. Let's go! You drive on with Ramón. They know that you have the diamond. - Time to say goodbye. - But... Just in case. Everything will be fine, okay? We'll meet again. Adi, take care of the stuff. Good boy. Unlock here and shoot there. - Seriously easy. - Be careful. You'll shoot us. Hold the cloth. One, two, three, four. - What are you doing? - Five and six. Maybe we aren't good, but we surely aren't bad. If they shoot, we're seriously dead. Hello? Hello? Are you the children with the diamond? Yes. First the diamond, then the prisoners. First my parents. First the diamond. First my parents. The diamond. Now! No! First my parents! Stay calm, boy. Nobody has to get injured. Tell him that we'll stick to our deal. He mustn't mess up. We'll stick to the deal, if you do so as well. Sure, boy. You don't really want to shoot? Right? My parents. Now! Eduardo, the parents! - Did you... - No. Eduardo, do it! Get them here! Go! Here they are. See you! Let's go. Mum! Dad! - Núria? - Núri! Núria. I thought I'd never see you again. My daughter, I'll never leave you again. How are you? I think it's time to go back home. To write everything down. I'll go ahead. Good night, my son. Good night, dad. So? Are you excited? - Seriously excited. - What does seriously mean? Something like really strong or especially good. Why don't you say "especially good"? Because I seriously like seriously more. Because you're a serious smartass. You still have to tell me how the book ends. Konrad and Parsley become friends. And Konrad travels back home with his uncle. They go through the cabinet again. It suddenly stands in the middle of a jungle. The book is nice. Seriously nice, because it ends nicely. It's not your fault, you know. It's Hitler's. And of those who expelled you from the country. Those who started the war and lock people up. And kill them. It's their fault. The murderers. Not yours. But now you travel to America, to your mother. For you. For me? Only on loan. - For you. - You got it from your father. And you got it from me. - On loan? - Seriously right. Next, please. Papers, please. Stand in line. Not here. That's not much you got there, son. And you're looking for your mother? Kate Kirsch? Katja Kirsch. How much is 3 times 7? 21, Sir. Next. Next, please. Can I see your papers? You know how to polish shoes? I do not intend to polish shoes, Sir. I want to become a journalist. Welcome to the United States of America, Robert. Rolf. My name is... Hey, Adi. Wait! Hey! Dammit! Come back, boy! Hey, boy! Hey! Who are you? Mum. Mum. Let me look at you, big boy. More than 82 million people are on the run worldwide today. More than 34 million of them are children.
