--== McEphie ==-- [woman on TV] Until now, they still haven't finished the construction. And there are no lights. It's so dark here. That's why this area's accident prone. It's bothersome I don't know when they're planning to finish it. [reporter] It's been more than a year since the construction on this road started. But it remains unfinished until now. Motorists have been complaining about it. [vehicles honking] [ominous music playing] [car door closes] [engine starting] [thuds] [phone ringing] Yeah, I'm on my way home. Just need to swing by a meeting. Something came up. -Yeah, I'll just-- [yelps] -[phone thuds] [car stopping] -[gasps] -[eerie music] Hello. No, it's nothing. I'll see you later. Bye. [footsteps] [ringing] [giggles] Happy monthsary, babe. Don't be late for our dinner later. Hmm... I'll think about it. Babe, our reservation is at 8 p.m. Okay? Don't worry, babe. I'm always worth the wait. [Ned] Why, babe? Something smells like burnt rubber. Or, something. Burnt rubber? Anyway, I bought a dress for later. I'll give you a preview. Wait. [door closes] Ta-da! Oh, my god, babe. You're so beautiful. You like it? [static] Is everything okay? [Drew] What's happening? [clicks tongue] -[exasperated sigh] -[clicking] -[grunts] -[clicking] [eerie music] [static] [gasps] Babe, are you okay? Shit! [gasps] [Ned] Babe, what's going on? What's happening? Babe, is someone there with you? [shushes] [Ned] Babe! Babe! [buzzing] [eerie music] [eerie music continues] -[clatters] -[footsteps] [door creaks] -[door slams shut] -[gasps] [crying] [coughing, choking] [coughing continues] Hon! Whose car is this? Morning. You look stressed. Your car's acting up again, right? Yeah, I had to bring the car to the repair shop this morning. Good thing the mechanic let me borrow his service car so we could have something to use today. Come on, let's go. Later, I'll give you a lighter. So you can set your old car on fire, okay? Guys, I don't know what's happening. Daily Journal Online has been getting very few hits. Since our last meeting, none of our content went viral. Just coffee? [man] How about some bread, too, to make it feel like... -we were in a funeral? -Guys, focus, please. But, ma'am-- Nothing new is happening. What do you mean? There's news everywhere. Just make sure it's shareable. Actually, anything will do. Just make it clickbait, it will be fine. Like what? Child sees the Virgin Mary dot, dot, dot. Like that? We can't even identify the subject because it's all hearsay. Then, put "allegedly" or "supposedly." I even make my interviewees bawl. It's because you put Vicks on their eyes. -[laughter] -At least, I get a lot of hits. Sonya, do you hear yourself? You are so unethical. [Monique] Donna, that's enough. Everybody, stop bickering. Our site's static. We need to move forward and gather new content. Robin, what are you going to write for your finance column? Ah, yeah. I'm actually writing about investment opportunities for millennials and Gen Zs. So it's not all about travel and gadgets. Wow! A rich kid with an Economics degree in the States becomes a columnist right away. Excuse me. My column is finance. If she thinks she can do a better job than me, then, be my guest. [Monique] Moving forward... Mention the depression kids are experiencing these days and their lack of the will to live. That would make it interesting and relevant. -[Robin] Why? -Donna, next. I'm going to write a piece about illegal logging... Not again. Nobody's going to read that. Laon... There's a night market in Laon. You should write about that. That will trend. Move it, guys. [man] All right, move it. Everyone. [claps] -Yes? -Ma'am, can you check this? -Why is the picture pixelated? -Ma'am... Ma'am, they're all naked. No. Just blur it a bit. Show the naked bodies. Expose a little of the face of the good-looking guys. -Do it now. -Sure, ma'am. Okay. Ma'am, are you okay with the report that I emailed you? About the woman who got into an accident? -Yes. -No. Change the headline. "Fat Woman Skewered, Dead" Do we really need to mention that she was fat? Why would people want to read the same old news? -Come on. -Yes, ma'am. Ma'am, about my report... [staff] Ma'am, I need your signature. -Thank you, ma'am. -Thank you. What is this? -Yes, perfect front cover. -Okay, ma'am. Ma'am, I've been a reporter for 7 years but all I do is report about night markets. Can I try "day market" for a change? Donna, I don't know how to tell you this. You can't write. That's a little insulting-- I know you graduated with honors in Journalism. You know the 5Ws but you're forgetting the H - Human Interest. That's why nobody bothers to read your stories. [Donna] My ego left the room. -Ma'am, please... -Fine. It's up to you. Just show me something that's shareable on social media. Okay? I will. -Hey! -[yelps] Oh, my god! [laughing] -You're late, as usual. -I know. If only your favorite hangout place isn't this far. [Eric] Fine. It was here you became a couple. -Hmm... Such a beauty! -[grumbles] Bro, Donna already ordered food for you. Why is my twin sister so cranky today? Well, I just realized that my work is not news writing. It's fiction writing. I shouldn't have studied Journalism. I should've just taken Creative Writing. Donna, admit it. You have always been stubborn even before we were born. You do what you like. How about you, hon? When you were a reporter, did you just give them what they asked for? No. That's why I switched to column writing. See? How I wish. Anyway, future brother-in-law, how's your new townhouse? It's finished. Your design was great. Of course! So, when are you two moving in? Oops... [Eric] Sensitive topic? Sorry. I moved in last week. I'm just waiting for your sister. Hon, I'm sorry. Promise, I'll visit your place soon. I just have a lot on my plate right now. It's been 7 years and nothing's happening in my career. And Mama keeps telling me that I took the wrong college course. Unlike her favorite son who's a licensed architect now. Wow. I wish Papa was still alive, so I'd have somebody on my side. A little too early for the primetime drama. Hon, it's okay. [Robin] I had it built for us. You can move in anytime you want. I'm at a loss for words. Aren't you the pretty one? [phone ringing] [Donna] It's Miss Monique. She sent me a text, but I think it's for Jino. There's an accident at the blind curve. Forward it to Jino. No! It's mine. She sent it to me. Accidents are better than night markets, right? I need to do this. Got to go. [Donna] I'll leave you two. -Hey! -Bye! Donna! Did she just leave? [indistinct chatter] [sirens wailing in distance] [exhales deeply] Game. Ma'am, you're not allowed here. Kevin! He's my friend. Fine. [Donna] Do you remember me? [officer] Police Major Kevin Flores. Yes, it's you. [Donna] We were classmates in college. -Donna. Donna Suarez. -Donna Suarez. You wrote that terrible piece about me when I refused to be interviewed about the ROTC military training, right? Have you ID'd the victims? Not yet. We're waiting for the evidence. What for? It's pretty obvious. Look. See the skid mark? It's short, but pronounced. Meaning, they were driving very fast. And didn't realize they'd hit this. Somebody moved the barrier which caused the accident. They must be driving around 50-60 KPH. [Donna] The trajectory is upwards. That's why somebody got thrown. The girl, probably. The woman was driving. She was dragged because she was clutching the handlebar. -[Donna] Yeah. -[Kevin] Like this? So, you already knew that. You can't get near them. You can't touch them. This won't take long. Hello. Bring the ambulance here. The reporters are crowding around the dead bodies. Just a second. Kevin, please. [man shouting] Eliza! -[man] Eliza! -[officers] Wait! Wait! [clamoring] It's my fault! Don't leave me! My daughter! Eliza! [eerie music] [screams] [Donna] The couple allegedly had a fight on the night the wife left. She was angry and that made her reckless. She was speeding at an alarming rate which resulted in tragedy. This is Donna Suarez for the Daily Journal Online. Finally, after 7 years, I got a hit. Congratulations. Congratulations, hon. You deserve it. I better go back to work. It's a pity. Papa is not with us anymore. Hey, I know your dad is proud of you. [Robin] Here, let me help you. Thank you. Was that the report Ma'am Monique was supposed to text me? Uhm, Jino... Karla, that thing I told you... [James] I know the hits. I know that. What kind of media ethics is that? James, I've said it before, and I'm going to say it again. [Monique] We're obsolete. Nobody's printing newspapers anymore. Everyone is now online. We need to keep up with the times. Miss Monique, my news is getting a lot of shares and hits. [James] This child... She used to be intelligent, passionate, and principled. And now? Such a disappointment. Donna, you messed with the accident scene. Who was your prof in media ethics? James, Donna's approach was fresh. It was ordinary news that she made interesting. It's news. It's not supposed to be interesting. It's supposed to be factual. And objective. Excuse me. Yes, Donna. I followed your advice. I used a different angle for the story. Very good. Remember, the people are angry. They want blood and gore. [Donna] And just like that. It's been a week since my story went viral. Now I'm back to nothing. Not even an accident. Or, a kidnapping. Nothing. Uh, hon, I'm sorry. Don't you think you're feeding in to all the negativity? Negativity? What are you saying? Hon, I'm a reporter. It's my job to let people know what's going on. Don't you think you're just feeding people's thirst for blood and gore? You're being negative. [Donna] Here's your coffee. No sugar. [Robin] Thank you. You should think of it as - I'm feeding them what they want. It's what they expect so it's what I'll give them. But, hon, why don't you go back to your investigation on illegal logging? Eat something. Illegal logging... But Miss Monique said, "Why write a story that nobody will bother to read?" It's nonsense. It's better to... -[phone ringing] -Stories? Stories, news, same banana. Wait a second. It's Miss Monique. -Babe... -It's Miss Monique. Hello, Miss Monique. [Monique] We got a tip that there's a livestream on FB about a suicide. It'll definitely go viral. Of course, Miss Monique. This will go viral for sure. Okay. Thank you. [whispers] Hon, I need to go. Uhm, yeah. Go ahead. -Okay. I'm on my way. -[Monique] Okay. Okay. Thank you, Miss Monique. Bye. Hon, I'm sorry. But I really need to leave. -Yeah. -Are you sure? Thank you. Love you. Bye. Oh, my. What happened? [sobbing] I don't know, ma'am. I just finished the laundry when I saw her. She was already dead. Ma'am, you can't go in. The police are not here yet. I already called them. I'm going in. There. Now it looks like a suicide. [Kevin] Why is the door open? It's you again? Did you touch the victim? No. I didn't do anything. Who saw this? The cleaning lady did. So she screamed. You can leave now. We need to work here. [Donna] Just a second. A few more shots. If you leave a mark, you'll become a suspect. Fine. I'm leaving. The authorities are pointing to suicide as the probable cause of this grisly death based on the CCTV footage found inside the home of the victim. This is Donna Suarez reporting for Daily Journal Online. [officer] Sir, let's bring the CPU to the station. [Kevin] Pagsibigan, what are you waiting for? -Secure the computer right away. -Yes, sir. [footsteps approaching] Why are you still here? [Donna] Uhm, I'm just about to leave. Bye. [Donna] What was she looking for? [eerie music] [woman sobbing] [Donna] The authorities are pointing to suicide as the probable cause of this grisly death. The victim was allegedly suffering from a mental illness. This is Donna Suarez reporting for Daily Journal Online. [laptop slams shut] [door opens, closes] Sir Kevin. Bonifacio and I are already here. [Kevin] I'm on my way there. I'm just in the area. Sir. I don't believe those were all suicides. And Donna was always there. [Kevin] That's why I sent you there to make sure that she had nothing to do with them. [man] Can I ask you something? Where does Donna Suarez live? Let's go. [Robin] Hey, there's a banner. It should be on the gate. [Donna] Ma! [Donna] Ma! What is this? [Donna] It's not necessary. It's just us. And it's huge. [Myrna] So what? I was even thinking of putting your picture there. Wow, Ma. Really? You know, you're actually smart. That's why I don't understand why you took up Journalism. So, now, you don't have money. Are we starting this again? Why couldn't you be like your twin brother? An architect. Oh, well... At least, you're the "Suicide Queen." I better call Eric. [phone ringing] [Eric] Hey, Donna. Pinkytwink! Mom has been grilling me nonstop. [laughing] Pinkytwink with a golden heart. Never mind her. She's just teasing you. [Donna] Where are you now? I'm on my way. I'm actually making an illegal U-turn. So I'd get there faster. Yeah, right. Take a picture. As proof. Seriously? Fine. Okay. -[camera shutter clicks] -[phone chimes] All right. Hurry up. There. Don't do it! -What's your problem? -Stop right there. It's dangerous. Are you okay? What's going on? No. A hobo's attacking me. -It's dangerous! Stop! -What's wrong with you? -[honking] -No! Stop! [gate opens] [gate screeching] -You're a liar! -[Donna screaming] You said my girlfriend was crazy! You're lying! [Robin] Let her go! -[grunting] -[siren wailing] You're a liar! Stop it! Drew didn't kill herself! Put him in the car. Donna, that's Ned. Drew Caleon's boyfriend. Do you want to file a complaint? Never mind. Are you sure? Donna. Let's go. Hey. Don't listen to that guy. Okay? He's crazy. Did I do something wrong? Well... If I wrote that report, I wouldn't make those assumptions. But, hey, look. It worked. You got the interest of the readers. And, look. You're finally reaching your dream. [door closes] [Eric] Sorry, guys. I'm late. What's going on? -Finally! -Ouch! You're late, as usual. [Eric] Witch! Chicken? -[Eric] Wow! -Wow! Donna, I want a grandchild already. What? Why don't you ask Eric for one? He's your favorite son, anyway. [Donna] Because he's an architect. [Myrna] How on earth can he have a child? He's a twink. Twink? A good-looking one though. [chuckles] [phone ringing] Just a second. Excuse me. Just a second, Ma. [whispers] I'll talk to you later. Okay. Was that King? [soft chuckle] Seriously? Don't tell me you're getting back with him. Once a cheater, always a cheater. Donna, give me a break. Don't you dare. I'll cut off our umbilical cords. What? Oh, that face... Shit. You're back together. Well... What else can I do? I love you too much. Okay. Thank you very much, Donna. I love you, too. Spit? Really? Eric, here. Bring this home. Ma, I'm good. You'll get hungry. Ma, I have lots of food in my condo. It will just spoil. I'm fine. Okay? Don't forget about tomorrow. You'll bring me to the airport. Of course. I'll go with you. I promise. Bye, Ma. Donna, bye. -Bye. -[Eric] Congratulations again. -[Eric] Thank you. -[Donna] Take care. Wait, you forgot this. Oh, yeah. Be careful. Where'd this come from? [crying] [crying continues] Little girl, Which unit do you live? Are you okay? [door slams shut] [gasps] [banging on door] [grunting] [screams] Donna. [gasps] [exhales, panting] [Myrna] Why is your brother not here yet? I'm going to miss my flight. [Jino] We are here at the condominium building where they found suicide victim, Eric Suarez. The authorities are still gathering details. Mr. Suarez was the twin brother of our fellow reporter, Donna Suarez. [sobbing] -[indistinct chatter] -[sirens wailing] [reporter] Ma'am, is there anything you want to say? Ma'am, what do you think drove your son to kill himself? Were there any signs... -What are you doing? Stop it! -[camera shutters clicking] I said stop it! I will put Eric beside your dad. I will wait for you. Let's do it together. It's going to be okay. Why don't you stay with me at the townhouse? So you don't have to be alone. Here we go again. You, and that fucking townhouse. Can you give me a break? -I don't get it. -You can go now. -What? -Just go! You're telling me to leave? I want to be alone. Just go. Please. There's a lot that I need to do. Eric. I will never stop until I find out what really happened to you. [sobs] [girl laughing] [laughing continues] Who is it? [gasps] You're right on time. Let's have dinner? Can't you eat by yourself? [Jino] Two days after Eric Suarez, and there's already another suicide. He jumped in front of the car... [Donna] Wait. Suicide? Yes. Miss Monique didn't send the text to the wrong number this time. -By the way, I saw Sir Kevin. -[kid laughing] He's sending his regards. Miss Monique, why did you ask Jino to cover that news about... -[Monique] Suicide. -[kid laughing] Donna, are you okay? What is wrong with all of you? You keep asking me if I'm okay. No! Isn't it obvious? Are you happy now? Please, stop asking me because I'm not okay. [Robin] Donna, what's going on with you? [Kevin] Donna. I remember when we were in college. You were enemies with everyone. Anyone who crossed you, you reported them in our school paper. Even the little accidents... What's your point? That you stood your ground. [Kevin] You never buckled. You didn't care what anyone thought. I'm not used to seeing you like this. Sad. Broken. [Donna] Are you happy now? No. I'm sorry. I'm just...surprised. Yes, you rub me the wrong way. But I have respect for you. Is there anything I can do for you? I want to get a copy of the CCTV footage of the condo on the night my brother died. I just want to know if he really... If... if he really was alone... Kevin, I know I haven't been nice to you. But I'm begging you. Please help me. I need to know what really happened to my brother. I'm begging you. Please. Usually, getting a copy of the footage isn't easy. -But, sure. I'll help you. -[crying] [Donna] Why are you frightened, Eric? [Donna] What's happening? [Donna] What are you running way from? Kevin. My brother did not kill himself. I saw the CCTV footage. He was afraid of something. [Kevin] Donna, for the last time, the case is closed. There was no suspect. No motive. There was no forced entry. No witness. Allegedly, suicide. That was it. I'm sorry. [phone thuds] Eric, where had you been going? [engine humming] [tricycle stopping] Stop! Don't cross! Why? It's dangerous! Stop! You will die! It's dangerous! What are you saying? Get out of my way! Stop! Stop! It's dangerous! -Stop! -[driver] You want to get hit? Don't cross the barrier! [shouts] No! Are you okay? Why did he hit you? Miss. [stammers] You need to warn him. What? Here's his plate number. Warn him. I need to know who owns these plate numbers. Ma'am, I'm sorry. But I can't help you. Why not? It's public record, right? Miss Donna, you might use it for your report. And you know how that always ends. You'll make us look bad. Capt. Salvador, give it to her. But, Sir Kevin... It's on me. Yes, sir. Excuse me. Thank you. [phone buzzing] -Hello. -[Robin] Hon, can I see you? Robin, not now. [Robin] Please. What is it about? Just trust me. This is important for both of us. Fine. I'll be there. I got a job offer. From The Canadian Post. Good. That's great. Congratulations. But I haven't accepted it yet. Why not? That will be a waste. You're turning down dollars? Opportunities? Well, you're a rich kid anyway. I haven't accepted it yet because I didn't want to leave you here. I want to be with you. Especially now that you need somebody. Somebody to cheer you up. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. And I want the rest of my life to start soon. Sadly, though. You don't see me. Here. You can keep it. It's up to you what to do with it. Did you just arrive? You didn't come home again last night. And now you reek of alcohol. Why is it so dark in here? You're wondering why? They cut the power because you're squandering the few cents that you make. Papa, stop it. [pants, cries] If all those who made the u-turn died, then this last person will die, too. Albert Awa, he's the only one here who's still alive. [snoring] [clattering] Hey! You're too noisy! Son of a bitch! What are you crying about? Cathy! Jann! [crying] [crying] [heavy breathing] -[giggling] -[gasps] [panting] [groans, pants] [screams, groans] [suspense music playing] Man, he was alone. Nobody else was inside. Suicide? But his wounds look like it was a road accident. Albert? Hey, miss. Why did you touch the corpse? Did you know him? Sorry, Miss. But you're a suspect now. Handcuff her. Wait, I didn't do anything. His name is on the list. You were my husband's woman! I knew it! You were the reason he hardly came home to us. I didn't know your husband. What do you mean? You didn't know Mr. Awa? What were you doing in his apartment earlier? I just wanted to talk to him because he made a u-turn. Sir, is there a complaint against me? If not, then can I go home? Not yet. We reviewed the CCTV footage of the compound. You weren't there when the victim died. But since you touched the corpse, you're a suspect now. You got some nerve. Let me go. Are you going to tell me now why you went to Albert's apartment earlier? And what's this list of those who made the u-turn? You got this from the traffic bureau when I vouched for you, right? Here's some more. I still haven't confirmed everything. But, yes. Most of the names there, committed suicide recently. Here... it's Drew. The very first one. Your brother, Eric, is in this list, too? I went to Albert's apartment because he was next on the list. I wanted to see him alive, so I could see who was killing them. I wanted to warn him. Who gave you this list? He could be the killer. It was Selo. The hobo at the u-turn? Yes. Why? Pagsibigan, get the car ready. We're leaving. Bring Bonifacio. Kevin, he didn't do anything wrong. He just wanted to help. How did he get the plate numbers on this list? How did he know these people were going to die? Selo? What is it about, sir? Come with us. Why? I didn't do anything. He's telling the truth. He didn't do anything. We're not apprehending him. We just want to ask him a few questions. We'll just talk, okay? But I didn't do anything. What did I do? I didn't do anything. Sir, have mercy on me. I didn't do anything. Here he is. He wouldn't say anything. He wanted to talk to you. We'll be there. I'm sorry. I got you into this mess. Donna, I didn't kill them. Do you know who is? Haven't you noticed? Before this string of suicides, there was a mother and daughter who... [giggling] Hey... Mother and daughter who? The mother and daughter who had an accident in that same u-turn. I saw what happened. [woman crying] I wanted to call for help, but instead I just hid. That's why they cursed me. They latched on to me. I couldn't call for help because... They would bring me back to... [sobs] Nothing. I just hope that somebody else could see them, too. They are the ones killing those who mess with the barrier at the u-turn. To avenge their death. Why didn't you tell the police about it? I am scared. They're watching me. [sobs] Even you, they've latched on to you, too. Marcelo Caniogan, you're under arrest. Wait. Why? What did he do? He was given parole. But when he was asked to return to prison, he went into hiding. What? [Selo grunts, groans] Selo! Don't do anything stupid. Selo, calm down. Let's talk. Don't come near. I'm begging you, Selo. Please. I will never go back to prison. Selo, we can talk about this. Selo. Put down your gun. Slowly. Stop right there. Selo, calm down. Let's talk. Put down your gun. -Kevin... -Don't come near. Let me go. Calm down, Selo. -[sinister laugh] -Let me go. Let her go. Put the gun down. [pants] [sinister laugh] No! Stop! No! [screams, sobs] Selo! Just a second. There's a barrier. Don't touch that. What the hell? Don't remove it! We're just passing through. No! Believe me. You'll get killed. What's with you? Killed? No, that will kill us. Look! It's true. Get out of our way. Bye. It's late. You need to get some sleep. Why won't you believe me? Get some sleep! Wait! Kevin! Kevin! Donna. Kevin, we need to help those two. They will die next. Who? Donna. I'm sorry. I've been ordered to stop meddling in these suicides. I'm sorry. You want proof that I'm telling the truth, right? Here it is. Here. Okay. Fine. Let's go there. Let's run the plates. If they're in jail, we can watch out for them and they'll be safe. Yes, Donna. Hey! Nobody move! What's going on? Wait! Wait! Hey! Where are you going? [screaming] Stay here. -But, sir... -Just a second. Wait, weren't you the lady at the u-turn? Such dedication. We made a u-turn, and now you're sending us to jail? Now we'll see if what you're saying about the "killer ghosts" are true. Can't we talk about this? This is a little too much. How long have you been here mate? A year, mate. That's long. What for? Me? Double murder. Really? We're in this together, mate. [groaning] [grunts] Kevin, thank you. What for? I know you don't believe me. But at least you trust me. If you're willing to put your name on the line and you're sure of what you're saying, then, why not? What's important is to save lives. Stop it! Go ahead! Kill him! Kevin... Stop it! [pounds] Shoot him! Let him go! Stop that! Don't shoot! They're minors! Stop that! [glass shatters] [whistling] You got turned around by Suicide Queen, Donna Suarez. What happened? Illegal detention of two minors. And they died in our custody. You're suspended while the case is being investigated. I'm so sorry. It's all my fault you got suspended. It's not. It was my decision. It happens to the best of us. Still, I am sorry. Donna. Thanks for coming. I can't drive anymore. So that's Kevin? Why? Nothing. I found out that the u-turn project was anomalous. It should've been finished long ago. But the budget was pocketed. That's why they left a temporary barrier there. But the worst accident there was the mother and daughter. Your first story that went viral, someone moved the barrier- that's where they crashed. You need to go back to your first report. The radiator is all rusted. That's why the coolant is not pumped in. Excuse me, Mr. Blue Manzon. Did you use water? Didn't you know I bought coolant? Sir Blue Manzon? Yes. Who are you? I'm... From the insurance company? Okay. Just a second. This way, Ma'am. Sorry for the mess. You're early today. [ominous music playing] That night, my wife and I had a fight. I promised her that I'd take us all out to dinner for my daughter's birthday. But I had a lot of work. So, my wife and my daughter left without me. The police say it was an accident. How could that be an accident? I don't understand. I didn't realize it would be like that. To lose someone you loved. But what hurts more is not knowing what really happened. Do you want it? I have extra copies at home. The couple had a fight on the night the wife left. She was angry. And that made her reckless. I want to thank you. I never really talked to anyone about this. It still hurts. I'll walk with you to the gate. Are you getting a taxi? No, I'm okay. Donna Suarez? Bong... Boss. Why did she interview you? Is she going to write a report about you on Daily Journal? Daily Journal? You're not from the insurance company? You were the reporter who sensationalized the death of my family? I'm a reporter. I had to do it. [screams] What for? So everybody could talk about my misery? By implying that I was a terrible father and husband? Blue, I'm sorry. Forgive me. Just go away! Go away! Please. Make her leave. Just go! Don't show your face here, ever again! [motor revving] [screams] What do you want? Why do you have to kill those innocent people? [screams] Answer me, who are you? Why did you have to kill my brother? He didn't do anything wrong. Why did you do it? Show yourself. Show yourself! You kill everyone who makes a u-turn here. Now... Show yourself. [ominous music playing] [door creaking] -[door slams] -[lock clicks] Based on the CCTV footage found in the victim's home, she was suffering from a mental illness. This is Donna Suarez, reporting, for Daily Journal Online. [sobs, pants] -[glass breaks] -[screams] [water flowing] [screams] [thuds] [pants] [screaming] [thuds, crashes] [sinister laugh] [bones cracking] You are heartless! You killed me and my daughter! A horrendous death, because of you! It wasn't me who killed you both. Believe me. I didn't do anything. It wasn't me. Even your other victims, it wasn't their fault. Because you've been dead a long time. [suspense music playing] [sobbing] [screams] [suspense music continues] Elisa! Anna! Please, not the headlights. Mama, I'm feeling cold. Just hang on, okay? [screaming, crashes] [cries] Don't kill me. I will find who did this to you. [sobs] Until tomorrow... [ominous music playing] Are you okay? [gasps] Is something wrong? I need to find out who moved the barrier that killed them. I got suspended because I did everything you asked me to. And now you're putting yourself in danger? This is the only thing I can do to save myself. They are giving me until tonight. Kevin, I made the u-turn. Sir, here's the copy of the CCTV footage that you requested. Angel, play it. Oh... I'm sorry, Sir. This was the night the main camera malfunctioned. Miss Donna, I hope you don't do an expose' on us. We don't want to go viral just because of this mishap. I don't do that anymore. Sir, I need to go. Angel will assist you. Thank you. [ominous music playing] Wait. Rewind. Why? There... That car... It entered the blind curve but... He returned right away... In the opposite lane. It couldn't have returned immediately. Trace this plate. Whoever is registered to this plate is the culprit and cause of all this. Here it is. I found the name and the address of the person who moved the barrier that caused your death. Whoever he is, I hope you forgive him and not avenge your death anymore. Here. Everyone is asking, are preparations enough to mitigate flooding now that the rainy season is about to start? Newlyweds, come with me and check out these homes to invest in for your future. For important celebrations, this is the perfect venue for you. I thought I'd never see you again. I just arrived from Canada yesterday. I turned down the job. I can't be away from you. Especially yesterday when you called me. I thought you were breaking up with me. What are you thinking of? Don't you realize? When you gave a name to the ghosts that means they're going to have a new victim. Actually, I'm feeling guilty about it. But I had to give them something. Otherwise, they'll kill me. And many others after me. Well. By the way... [soft music playing] I missed you so much. I missed you, too. I love you, hon. I want to see our townhouse. Are you serious? Of course. Aren't you excited? Of course, I am. Let's go. Come on. You know, since I left two months ago, this is the only time I'm going back to the townhouse. Eric designed this for us. Make yourself comfortable. I'll just change. [suspense music playing] Hon. Hon, what's the address here? 175 Sandico Street. Why? Whose plate number is this? That was my old car that I sold last time. My god. It was you. The ghosts are looking for you. It was your address that I gave to them. They know that it was you who killed them. Captain Salvador, what are you going to show me? Sir, I checked the logbook. Apparently, in the CCTV at the u-turn... There's recorded footage before the accident of the mother and child. You can check it out. How could that car be yours? It was registered to TSC Company. Precisely. Tiongson and Sons Construction Company. That was my uncle's. He gifted it to me when I hired him to build our townhouse. But it was always breaking down that's why I sold it. Why did you make an illegal u-turn there? Two people died because of you. Hon, I never made an illegal u-turn. Not there, or anywhere else. Sir, the man who was driving in the footage Ms. Donna reviewed was not the one who made the u-turn. There. He switched cars with another guy. They swapped keys. I never made that u-turn, okay? The car needed to be fixed. I met the mechanic, and we exchanged cars there. Who was the mechanic? It was Blue Manzon. Blue Manzon? Yes. I know where he lives. -[gasps] -[screams] Straight ahead! Quick! [suspense music playing] They're following us. They're out to get me. Blue! Open the door! Please! Blue! Please! What are you doing here? I told you never to show up here anymore. What's going on? We need your help. Your wife and daughter are after us. They think Robin caused their death. What? But the truth is- It was you! You moved the barrier that caused their death. It was you, Blue! -[screaming] -[door slams] [grunting] Robin! Get up! Robin! No! Don't do to him what happened to you! Please! Don't! [gasps] [girl laughing] Hon... [sobs] It was my fault! I want you to be at peace. Stay quiet. There's a door here. Quick! Here. [thuds] [groans] [suspense music playing] [whispers] Quick! We can go out of the gate of the shop. [bones breaking] [whispers] It's locked. There, over there. [suspense music builds] [metal clanking] [shrieks] [clanks] Enough! Just leave us alone. Please! Forgive us. Please. [pants] I'm here. Kill me instead. Don't hurt him. He didn't do anything wrong. Just kill me. Do it. Please. Elisa, stop it. Don't get in the way, Blue. I need to avenge my daughter. It was my fault. We were on the phone. You were mad because it was Anna's birthday and I was still working. Where are you? My god, Blue, it's your daughter's birthday. She's been waiting for you the whole night. I'm on my way. Okay? I promise. Don't bother. We're leaving. Wow, it's so pretty. It's a pity daddy's not here. [shrieks, crashes] It was my fault. I killed you. Forgive me. Enough! No! No, please. Forgive me. Anna. Mommy. Daddy didn't mean it. Please. [sobs] I'm tired of getting revenge. Mommy! [grunts, groans] Are you still mad? What? Do you want to kill us? Because you can't accept that your own husband... The person you loved most killed you? Can't you find it in your heart to forgive? Elisa, stop. It's enough. For our daughter's sake, I will not kill you. But it doesn't mean I have forgiven you. Bring me with you. Please. No, Blue. You will live. But your conscience will haunt you for the rest of your life. Elisa? Anna? Hey, what happened here? Stay here. Donna, thank you. If it weren't for you, there would be no justice for Elisa and Anna. I hope their victims get justice, too. Thank you for all your help, too, Kevin.
