Chasing the Butterfly of Death Koongwon Nam, Ja-ok Kim Jungchul Kim, Mahn Kim Director of Photography : Sungchoon Lee Film Editing by : Heesoo Kim Director of Music : Sangki Han Produced by : Jinwoo Jung Directed by : Hee-young Kim - How much water do I need to put in? - You don't know? Call yourself a woman? Everything tastes great outdoors. Hey, I brought some fresh vegetables from the town. - Oh, you got some spring onions. - City veggies are so unfresh! Why don't you go help out? Girls these days can't cook... I've been living alone for 3 years. I'm sick of cooking. Hey, it's a butterfly! Why'd you kill the poor butterfly? Is it that trivial? People can't live forever. When it comes to a death, people are not any different. It is just as trivial as a bug's death. That's so thoughtless! Human death is much more noble. Do you want some juice? I was waiting for a company. Is death really noble? Can you keep me company on the way? The juice is poisoned. Didn't want to die alone. Why? Why are you trying to kill me? We'll be going to heaven together. I'm satisfying, I'm... I'm dying! I'm dying! Usually when there's only one victim, we treat it as a homicide. Anyways, here's a souvenir from her. It'll be like proof of your innocence. You're free to leave. So am I done here? After the autopsy, there was a secret in her body. It was a suicide. This poor kid's a victim. Let's go, Younggul. That poison has sunk my soul into suicidal thoughts. Come on. Books for sale! Financing available! Get out of here! I hate books! How about this one? About victory of will, good for young people to push one's fortune. I don't care if it's will or gold! Fine, but why are you talking down at me? - Get out! - Young man, you won't read even one book? I said get out! You've lost your will to live; you need this book. Get out! I'll charge you with trespassing. How's a dead man going to do anything? I need to sell you this book before you die. This book says it's all about will. With will you will never die! Get out! I swear I'll kill you if you don't! That's a lie, if you have a will to kill me, You would never kill yourself! I will kill you! Stop bothering me! I won't die! Like this book says, I have too much will to live! I can be shot and stabbed, I still won't die! If I stab you you're dead! Then kill me! Otherwise I'll kill you! I'll take care you, you piece of crap! Come on, try and kill me! Damn, I had to kill someone before I killed myself. Do not worry. I won't die... How about you play the harmonica for me? My blood's drained. Now I feel empty. My heart stopped beating. I feel unburdened. Body temperature's dropped. Just barely alive. I'm just living on pure will. You're as good as dead. Don't worry, I'll be joining you shortly. You can't die. I'll show you what will is about! Fine! I'll wait for you to die. The origin of the nucleic acid is not from the member of... Did you go to class today? If you killed yourself yesterday... Will you ever shut up? Read this book, the Victory of Will! I don't feel like it. Everyone is born with an ever increasing amount of will. Throughout evolution, human will has been the foundation. As we grow up so do the dangers. Through wars, floods, and earthquakes, it's will that sees us through. A will of living is flourishing these days. Even people get car accidents, they survive with the will. Everyone is living this world with their strong will. Why do you want to abandon this will to live, and die? It stinks too much! I'm going to have to bury you. No! I'm not finished talking. You're a corpse. You need to be buried! I won't die! You going to bury me alive? I'm going to bury you and your mouth! You going to bury me alive? Don't move! - Time to get buried! - No! A corpse with no beating heart! Just a mouth that won't shut up! Sick of these noodles everyday! I get hungry all the time, I need to die. The only solace from despair is a woman. Reason to reproduce is the most basic instinct. Screw that! A woman can save me? I'd rather die! Open the door! Open it! You think I'll die if buried? You can't beat me! If you do, it means you can beat death! I won't allow you to kill yourself. You don't know the solace that death can bring. A hard life can be fixed instantly with death. Supporting only life but not death, it's utter hypocrisy! My book! The Victory of Will! My book! My book! You've got maggots! I'm going to have to burn you. Even cremated, I won't die! My will will never die! Surrender to me! You trying to burn me? Destroying me? I'm immortal! I won't die! I will never! Are you going to burn me? That won't work either! I am still alive! I will never die! Cremate me! I'll never die! As long as I have the will to live, I will never die. Never die! Will for a life? Let maggots have that kind of thing. I should be executed for killing this old man. Farewell to the earth and to the cells. I'm back. I've got the WILL to live! Farewell to the cells? They've been here for millions years. Leave me the hell alone! Get a hold of yourself! I just want to teach you WILL! Just admit it. I'm alive because of will. No! - Surrender! - I'd rather die! - I just wanna die! - You've lost to me... No! The will to live is sacred. When will you realize this? Are you that stupid? Okay, okay. I am sorry. But how long will you let me suffer? It's a homework for every human. You don't have the right to abandon this will. You got it? You see, I'm not dead! Even turned to ashes I won't die. Never! It's just ashes, not dying! My will survives everything! Will! Will! Will This is another drug induced hallucination. He confessed to a murder but there's no evidence. Also this isn't human remains, it's just dirt! Look. That old man did some magic again. Just like he fooled me into believing will can cheat death. These stalactites are recycled via carbon dioxide and rain water. They grow 10cm every thousand year. Some of them are 100,000 years old. You are not allowed to take anything out. To preserve the integrity of our research. I found a treasure. I came to see this. A treasure? A female skeleton, thousands of years old! How is that a treasure? Shhh... Wait... How do you know it's a girl? You need to study anatomy. A girl's pelvic region's enlarged. Oh. Okay. We need the entire skeleton to sell it for a profit. - Won't we get inspected? - I'll take care of that. We will be inspecting everybody. Why do you have bones here? We actually wanted to bury his mom's remains here, but couldn't find a spot. You think this is a public cemetery? Yeah, you're right, it was a silly idea. Here's an anatomy book, use it to assemble the skeleton. So if I do this there's a job for me? Yeah, as Professor Lee's assistant. Make sure you do a good job. Professor Lee's very prominent in his field as an archaeologist. Past or present, poor people are the same everywhere. Since you have short hair, were you a monk? What time are you from? From the Shilla Dynasty of King Kongmyung. That's 2000 years ago! It's been that long? How are you still alive? To escape a marriage, I fasted for 30 days in a cave. A shaman told me I would wake up 2000 years later to meet a good man. A good man? Who, me? I'm sure it's you. Oh, I'm so hungry. I fasted for 30 days, I'm starving. All I have are noodles. At least they're fast. What's your name? I'm Younggul Kim You're surname is Kim? Me too, we can't get married! The law's changed. Now identical surnames can get hitched. Wow, it took 2000 years to change that stupid law. Go ahead eat and warm up. These noodles, just like 2000 years ago. What's wrong? The shaman told me I need to eat a raw human liver. A raw human liver? If I don't within 10 days I'll turn back into a skeleton. Are you thinking about eating my liver? I am starving... Are all women like this? At least you're honest. I need to pee... What the... I really need to pee... Give me a break, it's been 2000 years. Girls just come with so much baggage. What's this? Some modern clothes. It looks like a shaman's clothes! I couldn't get a human liver so I got a pig's liver. You trying to turn me into a pig? What do you want from me? Only demons eat human liver! All girls are demons. Even female mosquitos suck their male partner's blood. That's true. Let me go out so that I can get some liver. Humans aren't that easy to hunt. A man seduced won't mind dying. That's how I'm going to get his liver. As long as you're under my roof, I won't allow it! Then your liver's the only one I can get! Just wait, in 10 days I'll be back to bones! That was heavy! Let's go. What's that? It's a pastry machine. Maybe we can work it for some extra cash. It's all automated, so it's really simple. I've waited 2000 years for you. A man and a woman need to physically connect. You suggesting yourself for my liver? You've already tried to die many times, try to hang yourself. Don't throw away your life, this way is much better. For some reason, I'm not afraid of dying anymore. Does the male spider eaten by the female spider feel the same? I'm so starved I think I'm going to die. I will turn into a skeleton, if I don't get the liver now! I don't want to hurt you but I've waited 2000 years! Too long to die now, huh? Without life, everything's useless. I need to eat your liver... I have to do this to live. I can't do it. I hope I at least gained your love. Dr. Lee, I finished assembling that skeleton. Bring it to my study. This here's my classmate and he's looking for work. You'll have to help him out in the beginning. Of course. This is a young girl's skeleton. The pelvic area's not fully developed. Wonder how she ended up deep in that cave. Make sure you teach your friend everything. The research done here is very important to anthropology. What kind of research is done here? It's just basic skeletal research. You find the skeletons, and measure the sizes. It's a simple job. Why'd you quit? I kept receiving these weird packages. What were they? You'll find out soon enough. That's the professor's daughter. She's a bitch. This is my daughter Kyungmi, this is Moonho's replacement. Hello, I'm Kim Younggul... He brought this 2000 year old skeleton as a present. Excuse me! Kyungmi likes candles when we dine. That's nice and classical. Not classical, more like Western. Come in. Snooping around is for perverts! I'm just checking that everything's secure. You should have been checking outside. So this is where my butterflies are. Interesting pictures... Are you into Gothic stuff? Where did you get that butterfly necklace? A girl tried to poison me and this was hers. She died, but I was rescued. The police gave it to me after originally charging me with her death. I know her well. We were to die together. I read about what happened, I was resentful when only she died. What a coincidence. Like some sort of a trap. She died horribly. Alone. Well, why did she choose to die? Never mind that! But she'll have her revenge against you. Get out! Hello, Ma'am, it's already a noon! What's wrong with you? Where's my breakfast? My stomach is weak, I need my food right away. I've never let anybody go hungry. Just fix me something simple. I can eat anything. I don't do simple food. I only do great food, okay? Hurry up, I don't have time. Also, I don't eat with strangers. Get up! What? You can eat after she eats. Is this how you treat a guest in this house? The mistress is is queen in this house. What the... Well, I'll teach that queen some manners! How can you make me leave in the middle of my meal? That between you and her. She was afraid of repercussions from you. Fine, I'll eat in my room from tomorrow. But you need to bring my meal upstairs to my room. The lady has a problem with her knees, she can't come up. Wait! Yesterday, in my dream, my dead friend asked me to finish you. I've been a fan of your daughter's artwork, and I found out that she has an archaeologist father. I also heard that you have some old fascinating skeletons. I can show it to you, after my research is done. They aren't like the Mongolian skeletons from Beijing U., are they? You've done your research... So you have a treasure in this house. Be careful, private collectors can be very aggressive. Get in. Two orange juices, please. About this butterfly necklace, my friend died prematurely. We talked about dying together. This butterfly signifies death. You can't take it off. It's my order. My poor friend died alone. I don't want her to be alone in the heaven. Your friend's burning in hell, for trying to kill me. No, my friend was pure. She actually was dying of cancer. Cancer? Have some juice. High cheekbones and a square face. This is definitely Mongolian. Us Koreans are Mongolians as well. Not me, I'm no half-breed spawn of Genghis Khan. What about language? We both speak an Altaic tongue. Package. Open it. Receipt for a Mongolian skull. Will contact about payment later. Record the type. It will be an Altain type for its projected bone. 18 inches circumference 6 inches front to back. Dad! You still don't know who's sending these packages? This is a genuine miracle find! Let's go and inspect it thoroughly! - Is Detective Park here? - Younggul Kim! You still suffering hallucinations? What? Professor Kim's missing a head? Stop talking nonsense! Don't make me crazy like you! Huh? Come out! Ah, you started. You take care of that item? Dr. Lee, you've appraised 15 skulls and we've got 15 headless corpses. What, I'm a scholar not an investigator. These bodies are from people you were researching for Mongolian traits. Who stole this list of people? Do we have to talk about this now? These are definitely live beheadings! No manners, talking about this during a meal! Talking about corpses in front of a lady! The Mongolian people expanded all over the world. To the kingdom of Spain, Eskimo in Alaska Indians in North and Inca in South America It's in the papers! Mongolian civilization spread all over but they had some things in common. Excuse me... Let's open the crate. No, not here. We have intel that it may contain dynamite. Really? No neck! Somebody cut it off! Holy cow! It's unusually heavy. It can't be full of rocks. This is Professor Kim! He was cremated today. Hurry up and strip and clean it. Turn it into a skull! No, we need to report this to the police. We can't betray our client. Our research will get shut down. That'll ruin everything. Just hurry up and treat the skull. Never heard of antique dealers dealing in skulls. Somebody's beheading corpses or beheading live people! A famous actress is being buried today. Should we stake out the grounds? I need my sleep. Why should I die? I can't die, not this young. Why should I? I still have things to do. I can't be born again if I die. Death is worse than being a little bug. How are my wife and child going to carry on? I want to live! Help! Help! Investigated the scene. There's no evidence of wrongdoing. It wasn't a dream. We did find twelve bottles of soju liquor. With that much liquor you could imagine World War III. Me, I'm not crazy... but I guess crazy people would think that. Times are hard but now even corpses are being desecrated. Do you know who bought your appraised Genghis Khan skulls? I said Mongolian, not Genghis Khan. You need to stop these appraisals. Let the undertaker do it. Dr. Lee, let's see that 10,000 year old Mongolian skull. Anything with that much repute could be a fake. You want me to die alone too? Let's die together. At least come follow me to death's arms. Promise me! Hey! Kyungmi! Get up! You low-life! It's not your place. Hey. What's wrong? I don﹑t know. I feel this ringing. I dreamt about mom. She's in the afterlife, but she still worries about me. She feels like I'm in the care of a mental patient. I didn't do anything wrong. a mental patient?! It was a dream. Do you really think mom was happy with you? We never quarreled once. You think that's everything? What do you mean by everything? You guys never quarreled. You neglected her for your work. Mom told me never to marry a boring, lifeless man like you. Even if he's a millionaire. She said it's a suicidal thing. Why don't you just get some sleep? Maybe it's a lack of sleep. You caged mom up. Shut her up, and turned her into a living mummy! You guys never quarreled because you never even talked! Let me check, open up. Looks like you have a stomach disorder. We'll get lab results in a week. I thought Kyungmi was pregnant because of the vomiting. No, no... She is a virgin. I just want to give her a chance. Why don't you take her camping? I don't know if that's a good idea. If she does any wrong to you I will compensate you. What if she's wronged? If you want to play it safe, you could end up my son-in-law! I never thought you'd be sick enough to quit your art. Why you being so sarcastic? Wanna help me catch this blue butterfly in the fields? Not interested. It's worthless anyway. Don't artists starve to make their one true masterpiece? No such thing as a masterpiece. Maybe, but everyone needs one grand representative work. One grand work? One grand work. No. No, don't. Stop. I don't think so... no! - They're all crazy. - I'm getting a little antsy. I don't know why they're so immature like that. It's hormones raging out of control. Do they not know the value of their bodies? Maybe we're wrong. An arrogant girl, a will-less man. There's just not enough passion in here. Don't even think about it. You trying to give some sympathy? I don't accept sympathy. Well, either sympathy or love is fine. I just want to do what my friend couldn't. I want your life... Dying together. That's the ultimate expression of love. Your precious life would make everything right. Nothing would be wasted. It would be worth everything. Let me think about this... Dr. Lee promised me tuition money if I could bring happiness to Kyungmi. If I die, it doesn't matter. But wait, I do want to die! But I want to control when and how I die. Dad, it was fun. I don't know how to ask but did you guys do it? I don't think this is a proper question, but since I will be your father-in-law. I didn't do anything. What's wrong with you? I'm inexperienced sir. Why don't you just cut it off! What are you guys arguing about? I think he was too stuck up for you. Dad, you wanted to console me somehow, right? You asked him to take me out and do something, didn't you? What kind of father are you? The way you treat me, it's as if I'm some sort of sick farm animal. You're not even human! You're a beast! What do I have? How sick am I? It's cancer isn't it?!! I don't have long to live. Isn't that the truth? No, we can treat it. You can have chemotherapy. It's all about your will. As long as you have the will... Will? While my body's going to waste? Your will will be a waste as well. Kyungmi... Open the door! Kyungmi, please! Nurse! Come here! The door's locked. She doesn't want to see anybody. We'll check her out of the hospital. To be free. Free? Close the door! Where's Younggul? Where is he? He's just out right now. He'll be back soon. No. He doesn't want to see my dying face. Go downstairs. Your job is done. There's no occupant in this room. When you're dead you're dead. A death row inmate doesn't have a future. I'm just unlucky, you put me in that position. Bring him to me. He can help me with euthanasia. He's heartless enough, he can poison me. No! Never! Well, you can't do it! Just bring him over! Where've you been? Kyungmi's been looking for you. She checked out of the hospital? Because her case is hopeless. That's too bad. Grant her, her wish. There will be compensation. Compensation? You look like you lost the will to live. At the hospital I realized that you mean everything to me. I don't know what I'm doing. Love may be a luxury but you're a necessity. An absolute treasure. I never lose a treasure, that belongs to me. Before, love was a dirty word. Now I yearn for it. Damn, butterfly. Stop tempting me! Why do I have to be the objective? A life alone is meaningless. Don't go! Please don't go! I am a beautiful and educated woman! Don't erase me from your life! What happened? Screw this. I can't keep up this farce. Don't do this to her. You can't leave her like that. She's beyond hope. She is a living corpse! He abandoned me, didn't he? Now you're up to everything. My savior's gone. A person's promised death as soon as born. But I don't want to die. Don't put me in the coffin! With death everything becomes nothing. Don't let me turn into nothing. Dad! Dad! Save me... Please dad. Dad, please. I don't want to die! Death is being nothing! I'm afraid. Save me! - Calm down! - Dad! - I said calm down! - Dad, please Everything will be okay. Dad, please help me out! I don't want to die... Life is grand but death is even grander. Nothing can beat death, that's why it is grander. Death is the great equalizer. Enough talk about death. Let's drink. Girls with butterfly necklaces, they want me to go with them. Why didn't I go? Why didn't I go? Why! Drink! I'll go! Light more candles. The room's getting darker. My life's worthless My heart is going to stop. I'm so afraid. I don't want to die. How can I survive this night? And this horrible death? The light's gone out. Light it again. That's the only thing you can do for me! You want to just get rid of me, right? No? Light it! Hurry up! That young man sent a note and a cake. To Kyungmi my love, death isn't to be feared. I've killed myself so I can lead the way for you. I'll be with you every step of the way. I'm not afraid anymore. Love, Kim Younggul. This cake... Oh, thank you! Thank you! Now I'm not afraid. We'll be butterflies in the afterlife. Now I'm going to die... Time to die... To die, happily... Sorry, I had to sacrifice you. Please take care of her in the next world. I won't die! My will won't allow it! My will can beat death! You have to die. For my daughter... Die! Die! No! My will's too strong! Kyungmi! Dad! Kyungmi! Dad! So they asked me to come? They can't pay because their heads are cut? These boys are missing necks. They reported it? They're mental patients. Get them out of here. You're here. When he drinks he imagines crazy scenarios. Survived and lived by will alone. Fragile is life but it can be strong as well. It sucks but I think I'll keep living. The will to live is a good thing. Let me pay for your drink! Only because I miss the old school days. - Being a man is about will. - It's will. Man is will!
