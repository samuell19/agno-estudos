[POLICE RADIO] [DOORBELL RINGS] [DOOR OPENS] OH, MY GOD. WHAT'S WRONG? YOUR FATHER'S BEEN IN A CAR ACCIDENT. HE'S DEAD, ISN'T HE? [CHOIR SINGING] I REMEMBER. IT'S LITERALLY POURING OUTSIDE, AND SAM, IN A PANIC, PULLS THE CAR OVER. HE LEAPS OUT AND SPRINTS TO THIS CHURCH. HE'S HOLDING THE SEAT OF HIS PANTS. HE DISAPPEARS BEHIND THE CHURCH, AND THERE'S NO TOILET PAPER. AND NOW ALL THE PEOPLE ARE SCREAMING AT HIM AT THE CHURCH. AND SAM YELLS AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS, "DO YOU HAVE ANY TOILET PAPER, KLEENEX, OR ANYTHING?" GINNY YELLS BACK, "NO, DARLING. "WHY DON'T YOU USE SOME OF THOSE WET NEW ENGLAND LEAVES YOU DRAGGED US UP HERE TO SEE?" YOU KNOW, SAM AND I GO TO THE PIER EVERY YEAR. DID YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE WE FIRST MET? I WAS 18. I WAS STAYING WITH MY PARENTS. OH, GOD. HE WAS A CHARMER. HE WAS GOOD-LOOKING AND FUNNY. THE BEST-DRESSED MAN I HAD EVER SEEN. WE HAD OUR HONEYMOON RIGHT THERE, AND EVERY YEAR SINCE WE ALWAYS GO BACK. GOING TO THE PIER EVERY YEAR IS JUST SOMETHING THAT WE ALWAYS DO. LET'S GO FOR A RIDE. WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, I USED TO LOVE TO GO SWIMMING IN MY GRANDFATHER'S POOL, BUT I WAS SCARED OF THE DEEP END. ONCE WHEN I WAS ABOUT 8 OR 9, I WENT OVER TO THE POOL AND DOVE ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM. I TOUCHED THE DRAIN. IT WAS ALL SLIMY AND GREEN WITH MOSS. I FIGURED IT WOULD JUST SUCK ME IN, AND IT DIDN'T, AND I SWAM ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP, BROKE CLEAN OUT OF THE WATER. I FELT GREAT. YEAH? YEAH. EVERY TIME SOMETHING BAD WOULD HAPPEN-- LOSE A DOG OR... I'D GET IN A FIGHT WITH GRACE OR I GOT KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL-- I'D GO OVER TO THE POOL AND I'D TOUCH THE DRAIN. IT ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL BETTER. WANT TO TOUCH THE DRAIN? WHEN? NOW. YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT. WHY? MY GRANDFATHER DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE. WHOSE POOL IS THIS? I DON'T KNOW. COME ON, KIDDO. AH HA! FEEL BETTER? I GUESS. MOM? HEY, MOM. HO. WELL, THERE YOU ARE. HI. MY BABY SISTER. [THUNDER] WHEN'S THE BABY DUE? TWO MONTHS. WHERE WILL YOU LIVE? HERE. ON THE THIRD FLOOR. YOU'RE KIDDING. THAT'S PERFECT. MOM, CAN I MOVE IN HERE WITH YOU? IF YOU MOVE IN, I'M MOVING OUT. [DOORBELL RINGS] THAT MUST BE HANK AND GRACE. HI. HI. THANK YOU. HANK. HI. HI, BILLY. HANK. IT'S BEEN A WHILE, HUH? WHY DON'T WE GO INTO THE LIVING ROOM? GRACE WASN'T UP TO COMING OVER. CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING? I'M FINE. BILLY, UM, KATIE LEFT A WILL. SHE WANTED HER BODY TO BE CREMATED, AND SHE WANTED YOU TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR HER ASHES. DID SHE SAY WHAT SHE WANTED ME TO DO WITH THEM? NO. I GUESS SHE JUST THOUGHT YOU'D KNOW. I DON'T. WELL, IF IT'S ANY HELP TO YOU, GRACE AND I WOULD LIKE A MEMORIAL SERVICE AT ST. THOMAS', AND WE WOULD LIKE HER ASHES BURIED THERE. WHEN KATIE CAME BACK FROM EUROPE AFTER HER SECOND MARRIAGE HAD FAILED, I KNEW SHE WASN'T A HAPPY WOMAN, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO HELP. SHE AND GRACE STARTED FIGHTING AGAIN, SO SHE GOT IN HER OLD VOLKSWAGEN, DROVE DOWN TO SEASMOKE, AND DECIDED TO LIVE THERE YEAR-ROUND. I WANTED TO SEE HOW SHE WAS DOING. LAST SUNDAY I DROVE DOWN THERE. I WALKED IN THE HOUSE. I CALLED HER NAME. SHE DIDN'T ANSWER. I THOUGHT SHE WAS OUT TAKING A WALK. I POURED MYSELF A DRINK, AND THEN I WENT INTO THE BEDROOM. THERE SHE WAS, LYING ON THE BED, ALL CURLED UP LIKE A LITTLE GIRL. I THOUGHT SHE WAS ASLEEP. WELL, UH, I GOT TO GET BACK TO GRACE. BILLY, YOU THINK ABOUT ST. THOMAS', OK? YEAH. Jesus. [KNOCK KNOCK] MOM. MMM? HEY. WHAT? I'M LEAVING. BUT YOU JUST GOT HOME. YEAH. I KNOW, BUT I GOT TO GO. WHAT ABOUT KATIE? KATIE? YEAH. RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. I LEFT HER URN IN MY CLOSET, AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU... MAYBE, UH... COULD TAKE CARE OF IT FOR ME. KATIE WANTED YOU TO DO THAT. YEAH, I KNOW, BUT DOES IT REALLY MATTER WHO BURIES HER? COME ON. SHE'S DEAD, RIGHT? IT'S JUST ASHES. OF COURSE IT MATTERS. IT'S KATIE'S ASHES. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH HER? I DON'T KNOW. I DO KNOW SHE LEFT HER ASHES TO YOU. NOT TO HANK, NOT TO GRACE, NOT TO ANYBODY ELSE. BILL, YOU CAN'T WALK AWAY FROM THIS. MM-HMM. GREAT. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I DON'T KNOW. FOR A DRIVE, I GUESS. AND YOU'RE COMING BACK? YEAH. THAT SUMMER AFTER DAD DIED, WE STAYED DOWN AT SEASMOKE. HEY, BILL. TOMORROW'S THE 4th OF JULY. WE NEED DATES. IT'S A WELL-KNOWN FACT THAT WOMEN TEND TO PUT OUT MORE ON THE 4th OF JULY THAN ON ANY OTHER NIGHT OF THE YEAR. SPEAKING OF DATES, BILL, I'LL ASK YOU ONE LAST TIME. DID YOU HAVE SEX WITH MY PROM DATE? SHE WAS NEVER YOUR PROM DATE. THAT'S BECAUSE YOU HAD SEX WITH HER, BILL. YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY GUY WITH FEELINGS FOR ROBIN PARKS. FEELINGS FOR? YOU JUST ADMITTED IT. YOU HAD SEX WITH HER. APS, WOULD YOU CALM DOWN? I'M NOT ADMITTING ANYTHING. WHO'S THAT WOMAN? I DON'T KNOW. I THINK THAT'S THE LADY WHO'S RENTING THE CHANDLER COTTAGE. NO. THAT'S THE LADY WHO WILL BEAR MY CHILDREN. AP, SHE'S WAY OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE. EAT MY DUST, PAL. WHY RUSH IT? I'M GOING TO MAKE HER BEG. I WANT A DATE WITH ONE OF THOSE JERSEY GIRLS, BILL. I LOVE JERSEY GIRLS. THEY WEAR BLACK BRAS AND WHITE LIPSTICK. WHEN THEY FRENCH KISS YOU, I BET THEY PUT THEIR BUBBLE GUM IN YOUR MOUTH. THEY'LL LET US SNIFF THEM ALL OVER. APS, YOU'VE GOT A BIG PROBLEM. YEAH, BILL, I DO. BILL, HER LIGHTS ARE ON. THERE SHE IS. OH, GOD. OH, MY GOD. SHE IS SO BEAUTIFUL. DAMN IT. COME ON, LET'S GO, APS. IT'S OVER. YEAH. YEAH, I THINK I'LL STICK AROUND HERE FOR A BIT. APPLEBY, YOU'RE SO SICK. I KNOW THAT. DON'T LEAVE YET. OK. [CAR DOOR SLAMS] WHAT'S HIS NAME? DOOBIE EPSTEIN. DOOBIE EPSTEIN IS HIS NAME? YEAH. ARE YOU KIDDING? I'M NOT KIDDING. HE'S THE MOST COMPLEX MAN I'VE EVER MET. GRACE HATES HIM, OF COURSE. HE'S NOT A LAWYER OR BANKER OR SOMETHING SO PRACTICAL AND NAUSEATING YOU JUST WANT TO SLASH YOUR WRISTS. I'M MEETING HIM IN NEW YORK IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. WE'LL ELOPE AND MOVE TO EUROPE. YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED? YEAH. WHY? WHY NOT? WHAT WILL YOU DO AFTER THAT? WE'LL GO EVERYWHERE. WE'LL DO EVERYTHING. WE'LL GO TO PAMPLONA AND RUN WITH THE BULLS. WE'LL GO TO PARIS, HANG OUT AT THE LEFT BANK, TALK ABOUT EXISTENTIALISM AND REVOLUTION. IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT. I'M SO IN LOVE WITH HIM. YOU MEAN LIKE YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH THAT GUY JUST BECAUSE HE LOOKED LIKE MONTGOMERY CLIFT? HE DIDN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE MONTGOMERY CLIFT. OR THE PROFESSOR WHO WANTED TO TAKE YOU TO TIBET. I DIDN'T GO. OR THE LIFEGUARD, HAD REALLY GREAT BREATH. SHUT UP. HE'S DIFFERENT. THIS GUY'S DIFFERENT. HE'S DIFFERENT. GREAT. THAT'S GREAT. HEY, YOU OK? IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING'S ALL NORMAL EXCEPT... I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ANY OF IT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? WELL, WELCOME TO THE CLUB, KIDDO. HEY, WHERE'S YOUR PENDANT? I GAVE IT TO SOME GIRL. YOU GAVE IT-- WHO? ROBIN PARKS. WHY? SHE ASKED ME FOR IT. WERE YOU DATING HER? NO. IS SHE YOUR GIRLFRIEND? NO. SPIT IT OUT. I WENT TO GET A DATE FOR APPLEBY FOR THE PROM. SHE ASKED ME FOR IT, SO I GAVE IT TO HER. YOU GAVE IT TO SOME GIRL YOU BARELY KNOW? YOU'RE MARRYING SOME GUY YOU BARELY KNOW. THIS IS DIFFERENT. I GAVE YOU THAT PENDANT FOR LIFE. THIS IS DIFFERENT, TOO. I LOST MY VIRGINITY TO HER. WAY TO GO, BILLY. WAY TO GO. YOU STILL SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN IT TO HER. I KNOW. HOW WAS IT? IT WAS GREAT. I DON'T KNOW. I'D NEVER DONE IT BEFORE, ACTUALLY. I PROBABLY WASN'T LIKE GOOD OLD DOOBIE.

I'M A FAITHFUL KIND OF GUY. I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE WORLD. I GET WOMEN, AND WOMEN GET ME. THAT IS PATHETIC, APPLEBY. TAKE NEW YORK WOMEN, FOR INSTANCE. MUCH TOO TOUGH, TOO HARD FOR YOU. YOU'RE WAY TOO SWEET FOR THEM. FORGET THEM. PARISIAN WOMEN ON THE OTHER HAND, VERY SOPHISTICATED. THEY UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE WIFE- MISTRESS THING, THE NECESSITY OF IT. I DON'T SPEAK FRENCH. THEY DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH. BUT WHO CARES WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT? WHAT ABOUT ENGLISH WOMEN? GOOD QUESTION. YOU'RE PAYING ATTENTION. ENGLISH WOMEN, MUCH TOO COOL. THEY DON'T HAVE LUST. LUST IS AN ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT IN A RELATIONSHIP. I KNOW THIS FROM EXPERIENCE BECAUSE MY MARRIAGE HAS NOT A SPECK OF LUST LEFT, NOT A BIT. WILL YOU LOOK AT THE BUTT ON THIS NYMPH? BILL, I'M SO LONELY. BE MY FRIEND. PLEASE, DON'T LEAVE TOWN AGAIN. APPLEBY, I GOT A GREAT IDEA. LET'S GET DRUNK? WE DID THAT ALREADY. LET'S PLAY SOME BALL. PLAY BALL. BUT FIRST, WE GOT TO GET INTO OUR UNIFORMS. UNIFORMS. * ...WHEN YOU'RE SLEEPIN' * * POISON IVY COMES A-CREEPIN' ALL AROUND ** YOU KNOW-- WHAT'S THIS? KATIE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "KATIE"? IT'S HER ASHES. SHE PUT IN HER WILL THAT I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR BURYING HER. THIS IS WEIRD. WE'RE RIDING AROUND IN KATIE'S CAR, YOU'VE GOT HER REMAINS IN A JAR, AND YOU'RE IN YOUR CARLTON UNIFORM. AND YOU'RE NOT. IT'S 2:30 A.M., AND MY UNIFORM'S AT THE DINK'S HOUSE. [DOG BARKING] [BANG!] HELLO, MRS. APPLEBY. IT'S ME. BILLY WYATT. WHAT? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? HI, MR. APPLEBY. BILLY WYATT. WYATT. WHAT TIME IS IT? IT'S LATE, SIR. SORRY. IT'S 3:00 IN THE GOD DAMN MORNING, HARDLY A STYLISH HOUR FOR A SOCIAL VISIT. HOW'S YOUR MOTHER? VERY WELL, MA'AM. YOU'RE WEARING YOUR CARLTON UNIFORM? YES, SIR, I AM. THIS IS TOTALLY INSANE. HOW CAN WE HELP YOU? MA'AM, DO YOU KNOW WHERE ALAN'S CARLTON UNIFORM IS? I BELIEVE IT'S IN THE HALL CLOSET. WHAT ARE YOU, A MANIAC? LOOKING FOR ALAN'S UNIFORM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT? SIR, I'M AS DISGUSTED WITH MY BEHAVIOR AS YOU ARE. ALAN SAID IT WAS OK. HOW IS ALAN? HE'S JUST FINE. WHY DON'T I HELP YOU FIND THAT UNIFORM? THANK YOU, MA'AM. STOP ACTING AS IF WE'RE AT THE CRICKET CLUB HAVING FROZEN DAIQUIRIS. OH, MAN. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. NICE SEEING YOU BOTH. GOOD NIGHT, MRS. APPLEBY. GOOD NIGHT, BILLY. GOOD NIGHT, DINK. DINK? JUST WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? OH, NATHAN, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CALLING YOU THE DINK FOR YEARS. THEY HAVE? YOU FOUND MY UNIFORM. I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW HOW. PIECE OF CAKE. LET'S PLAY SOME BALL. IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. WE NEED A FIELD WITH LIGHTS. BILL, BE MY FRIEND. DON'T MAKE ME DO THIS. APS, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. THIS IS BREAKING AND ENTERING. THIS IS A MAJOR FELONY. THAT MAY NOT MATTER TO YOU BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE DOING THIS LOST GENERATION, JACK KEROUAC THING, BUT IT MATTERS TO ME. I'VE GOT KIDS. I CANNOT AFFORD TO GO TO JAIL. APPLEBY, JUST DO IT. OK. [CROWD CHEERING] PLAY BALL! NOW PITCHING, 38-YEAR-OLD ROOKIE OUT OF CARLTON ACADEMY, ALAN "THE HORSE" APPLEBY. BILLY WYATT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ROOKIE PHENOM FOR THE PHILADELPHIA PHILS. WHAT A SHOT! HA HA HA! YOU STILL GOT IT, BILL. NO, I DON'T, APPLEBY. I'M WAY OUT OF SHAPE. YOU JUST HIT IT OUT OF THE PARK. LOOK WHO WAS PITCHING. PICK UP THE PACE. THE POLICE SHOULD BE HERE ANY SECOND. APPLEBY, I'M HUNGRY! ALL RIGHT. BREAKFAST ON ME AT BOB'S. I'VE WANTED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING FOR A LONG TIME. ONE MINUTE YOU'RE PLAYING AA, ON YOUR WAY UP. THEN YOU JUST DROP OUT OF SIGHT. FORGET IT, APPLEBY. I'M NOT GOING TO FORGET IT. I'VE BEEN WANTING TO ASK YOU FOR 14 YEARS. WE'RE NOT LEAVING THIS DINER UNTIL YOU TELL ME. WHAT IS IT? FINE. I'M AT READING. PHILLIES HUNG THEIR BRASS UP TO TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT ME AND SCHMIDT. ONE OF US IS GOING TO THE BIGS. NINTH INNING, GUY HITS A LAZY FLY BALL OUT TO ME IN CENTER. I DROPPED IT. WE LOST THE GAME. EVERYBODY LOOKED AT ME LIKE I WAS A LOSER, SO I FIGURED I WAS, AND I QUIT. THAT'S IT. YOU REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I WORE THIS UNIFORM? NO. THE DAY I STOLE HOME. TO MAKE THE TRAIN. THEN MY DAD DIED, AND I QUIT BASEBALL. TODAY DOWN IN SEASMOKE, I REALIZED IT WAS KATIE WHO GOT ME TO PLAY AGAIN. WHEN I QUIT IN THE MINORS, SHE WASN'T AROUND TO BRING ME BACK. WHEN I WAS 10, SHE GAVE ME THIS PENDANT-- A SILVER BASEBALL ON A CHAIN. TOLD ME TO WEAR IT TO REMIND ME THAT I WAS A BALL PLAYER. SHE KNEW BETTER THAN ANYBODY, ESPECIALLY ME. WHEN I WASN'T PLAYING THE GAME, I WAS LOST. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, APS. IN THE PAST 14 YEARS, I'VE BEEN ONE LOST SON OF A BITCH. THING IS, IF THAT WERE ME, SHE'D HAVE FOUND OUT WHAT TO DO BY NOW AND WOULD HAVE DONE IT. DON'T WORRY. YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT. YEAH? YEAH. WHERE'S THE PENDANT? I GAVE IT TO ROBIN PARKS. WHY'D YOU DO THAT, BILL? I LOST MY VIRGINITY TO HER. I KNEW IT 20 YEARS AGO! YOU HAD SEX WITH MY PROM DATE. SHE WAS NEVER YOUR PROM DATE. HOW WAS SHE? ARE YOU KIDDING? SHE WAS HOT. A LITTLE HOT? MEDIUM HOT? EXTREMELY HOT? EXTREMELY HOT. WELL, EXTREMELY HOT. WELL, THAT'S IT. I'LL JUST KILL MYSELF. I'M SORRY, APPLEBY. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. ROBIN PARKS STILL LIVES HERE IN THE HOUSE SHE GREW UP IN, AND SHE'S DIVORCED. I'VE BEEN BIDING MY TIME, WAITING FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT TO LEAVE TRIPPY AND THE KIDS. BUT NOT ANYMORE BECAUSE FROM THIS MOMENT ON, ROBIN PARKS IS A COMPLETE SLUT! THERE, I'VE SAID IT, I'M FREE OF HER. SHE'S ALL YOURS, BILL. NICE. I GOT IT! I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HER ASHES. DOWN HERE IS GRANDFATHER CHANDLER'S POOL. WHENEVER KATIE WAS FEELING BAD, SHE WOULD TOUCH THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL. IT MADE HER FEEL BETTER. IT'S GONE. GO HOME. GET SOME SLEEP. I GOT TO GO TO WORK. YOU'LL GET IT. WHAT ABOUT BURYING HER IN SEASMOKE? I ALREADY THOUGHT OF THAT. IT'S WRONG. THAT'S WHERE SHE KILLED HERSELF. I'LL COME BY LATER. WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT. IT'S OK. I KNOW WHAT TO DO. HI, HANK. BILLY. CAN I TALK TO YOU? YEAH. COME ON IN. HANK WAS UPSTAIRS GETTING GRACE. I WAS ABOUT TO GIVE KATIE'S ASHES BACK TO HER PARENTS, THE LAST PLACE SHE WANTED TO GO. [KATIE] ALL THEY DID WAS DRAG THIS POOR HORSE UP TO THIS PLATFORM AND PUSH HIM OFF INTO A TANK OF WATER. EVERYBODY LAUGHED AND CLAPPED. I CRIED. I THOUGHT IT WAS MEAN. LET'S GO! THAT'S ALL I REALLY WANT TO DO, BILLY BOY. I WANT TO LEAP OFF THIS PIER AND FLY HIGH IN THE AIR AND HANG OUT WITH THE WIND AND DRIFT WITH THE CLOUDS. AND AT NIGHT, WITH THE SEA WILD, I'D MEET MY LOVER HIGH ON A CLIFF, AND WE'D SWOOP DOWN INTO THE OCEAN AND SWIM ALL THE WAY AND TOUCH THE BOTTOM, UP THROUGH THE DARK WATER AND BREAK THE SURFACE, AND THEN WE'D FLY TO JAMAICA FOR PINA COLADAS. GOD, I WISH I COULD DO THAT. HELLO, BILLY. HI, GRACE. HOW ARE YOU? UH... I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH KATIE'S ASHES. WHAT ABOUT ST. THOMAS'? I'M SORRY, GRACE, BUT ST. THOMAS' IS WRONG. KATIE NEVER WENT TO CHURCH. I'LL TAKE CARE OF HER. TRUST ME. HANK, I'M LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR HER. THANKS. DOES ROBIN PARKS LIVE HERE? YOU MEAN MY MOM? IS SHE HOME? I THINK SHE'S UPSTAIRS. ROBIN? HI. IT'S ME. BILLY WYATT. BILLY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME? I CAN'T TELL YOU RIGHT NOW. UH, DO YOU HAVE MY PENDANT? WHAT PENDANT? MY BASEBALL PENDANT. I GAVE IT TO YOU THAT NIGHT. REMEMBER? OH, THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF I STILL HAVE IT. UH, IF I DO, IT WOULD BE IN HERE. BUT I'M NOT...SURE. THIS? YEAH. CAN I HAVE IT BACK? SURE. YOU LOOK GREAT. YEAH? YEAH. SO DO YOU. YEAH? YEAH. LISTEN, I'M IN SORT OF A RUSH RIGHT NOW, BUT CAN I... CALL YOU SOME TIME? SURE. GREAT. WYATT! WYATT! WYATT! YOU'RE PINCH HITTING. NOW! BILLY. ONE RUN WINS IT. NOW PINCH HITTING FOR COSTNER, NUMBER 9, BILLY WYATT. OK, BILL! GO, BILL! PLAY BALL! ROBIN, LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. WHEN WE WERE 16, DID BILL EVER MENTION THAT I WANTED TO TAKE YOU TO THE PROM? NO, I DON'T THINK SO. INTERESTING. GO, BILL! NICE HIT! GO, BILL! GREAT! GO! GO! GO! SAFE! WAY TO GO, BILL! ATTA BOY, WYATT. NOW BATTING FOR THE SPIRITS, NUMBER 8, GARRETT FINLEY. SAFE! SAFE! ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT, BILL! GREAT GAME, BILL, JUST GREAT. I WAS TALKING TO ROBIN BEFORE YOU STOLE HOME. SHE SAID YOU NEVER MENTIONED THAT I WANTED TO TAKE HER TO THE PROM.
