Eden no sono Presented by: A film by: THE GARDEN OF EDEN Screenplay by: Director of Photography: Set Design: Production Director: Editing: Music composed and conducted by: Executive Producers: Produced by: Directed by: This work here from his mature period is a superb depiction of Tiziano's characteristic style. The exit is this way. Please, gentlemen. Please, this way. Follow me. Excuse me. Good morning, Sir. Today, I've gone ahead a lot. With Titian... I'm comfortable with it. What's that based on? Titian is not for beginners. - But, Dad, I think... - Dad is right. You could've chosen an easier painter. - Hi! - Robin Hood! How are you? So-so... The tourists pay more with plastic than with cash. And Alfio? Is he back already? Alfio is already with mum. Today was really a good day for him. Come in. Now that's a piece of junk. Lovely. 180... 215... 216. 216 grams. Nice catch, Alfio! Damn, this worth a lot! Nice work, son. Ah, Michele, what did you bring? Give it to mamma. That's all?! The child goes to museums. he loves art. Rich people go to museums! Let's see. We keep this, throw this... And what's this? Empty wallet, it's just a piece of paper. A stadium season ticket, an underground ticket. And here's an old stamp. He hasn't got the eye for it. Haven't got the eye for it! I'm sorry, mother. It was a bad day. My son, if you go on like this... We'll be bust! Do you know how expensive life has become? Vegetables have gone up! Meat, you can't touch it! All because of the inflation. O Ce'. How times have changed... If your dead father could see you... He knew his trade inside out. We had no wants with him! And you being his son, you must not forget that! You've surely forgotten him, but dad, he was a man! Hi! I'm Michele. Great. Bye, Michele, see you around. Wait! This... It's yours. - How come you've got it? - Well, I found it yesterday. It was there. And how come you know it's mine? From the papers! And I've seen you around here. You know, I'm also interested in... in... art. Thank you for the wallet. It was a souvenir from my grandfather. Listen. Would you like an ice-cream? Why not? But you must first tell me how you managed to open the handbag. What do you mean? This is not an ordinary handbag, it's more like a safe. One has to be really good to open it. Here you go again! Bye. Why would I have given it back then? I don't know. Maybe because there was little money inside. That's not true. Even 10,000 lire can come in handy. So you've counted it? See I was right? What're you saying?! I did open it, but just to see the documents! Who have you taken me for? I'm sorry. Maybe I'm exaggerating. My father thinks everyone around are thieves and criminals. And even I have begun seeing thieves and murderers everywhere. I must go now... Bye! Bye! Well done! Now I've understood how you tricked me. Listen to me, Alessandra! It's not what you think. - I am not doing it for myself. - I don't care! I'll turn you in! No, wait! Look. Look carefully. Cream and chocolate. Why do you steal? And you? Why don't you turn me in? Because I can't imagine a boy of my age ending up in prison. And then, contrary to my father, I don't think a thief is just a thief. And then, what is a thief for you? Well, I don't know. Maybe something else. Will you teach me to paint? I must go now. Bye. When will I see you? Damn it! Well? Why don't you eat? Is this not for your taste? I am not hungry tonight. What have you brought this time? Another underground ticket? These! Dollars! That's shit! Do you know your brother Alfio brought home two massive gold watches? Why don't you do like him? As if. What do you mean? At least, me, I'm working. And you, what do you do? You call this working? Trying to be ironical? You know me, I won't say it two times! But do you know him? - You keep silent! - Robin Hood will show you now! Enough! Behave yourselves! Sit! What kind of a family is this? Can't we talk calmly? Stop provoking me! Stop! And you must stop being an asshole! You were born here. You are one of us. And while you're living here, you must do your part! Understood? Alfio's right. That's how it is. You must get things straight and start stealing seriously. I won't lead this life any more! This work that is no work! Then what will you make of your life? Don't know. Still, I don't wanna be a thief any longer! Enough is enough! Farewell. Look at this marvels, look! And me stuck in here! If you work, it can happen. Why don't you then work seriously so we can also have a boat? Wait! Before saying enough. Don't you remember what your dead father used to say? He always said: "Fishermen steal fish from the sea, and the thieves... The thieves try to gather money from the sea of people. " Rich people don't starve if you rob them of a little thing! It's like in The Scalawag Bunch. You want to be Robin Hood. He stole from the rich, and gave to the poor. How much you know! Well done, son! We are the poor. Michele. It's years I dream of living in a real house. A house... Made of bricks and with a real WC! Me too, I'd want one, ma'. You see?! We think the same way! But, then, we've got to sweat. - No. - What?! I want to go away. To somewhere else. - How will that happen? - Where to? I'm going far away. Far away. Far away... Oh my God, what's up with him? Hey, our brother is mad! Hey, Michele! Don't worry, ma'. I'll write to you. Bye. Michele! Michele! Mother, Michele will be alright. You know him. He's a dreamer. He'll come back after a while. This is his home. Alessandra. Come with us. It's Marina's birthday and she's throwing a party. I can't. If you want I'll call your parents to ask for their permission. Thanks, you're very kind, but I've got things to do today. But we'll have fun! Have fun, then. Bye! Hi. Hi. - So, we'll you teach me to paint? - First, I'll have to learn myself. My father says I still am a beginner. Listen. Let's make a deal. I'm interested in what you say, not in what your father says. I'm interested in you, and that's it. What would you like to paint? The sea. One of these days we could hang out together and... No. That's not possible. You're afraid of the gorilla? We'll figure out a way to bribe him. No, it's not because of him. - You know, my father... - Stop! We have a deal. Your father has no place in it. Alessandra. Would you like to go? Thanks. But I really can't. I must go now. That's a pity. I had a surprise for you. - What? - It's no use talking about it. - You said you won't come... - Come on, tell me! What is it about? An authentic Etruscan vase. A friend of mine found it. He's grave robber. In a dig close to the sea. How nice! You know, I'd like seeing it. But it still is full of earth. He'd have to clean it, but he doesn't know how. You... do you know how? Of course. I like restoration a lot. Why don't you bring it to me? Because... Because... it's very fragile. And it could... break... during transportation. So, would you like to come? I must think about it. We'll talk over the phone. Alessandra's studying. Who's calling? A friend. Who is it? He says he's a friend of yours. Hello? Alessandra talking. - Hi, I'm Michele. - Hi. Would you like to see that Etruscan vase we talked about? Alright. Then I'll be waiting for you in one hour, in front of the flower shop. The one in San Gregorio. Alright. - Bye. - Bye. Alessandra. Yes, father. Come here. Sit down. Usually, friends have a name. He's very shy. A colleague from the school. - We've met recently... - Who doesn't want to give his name? It means he has something to hide. Or maybe it's you who's hiding something from us. If you really want to know, he's my boyfriend. - Is there anything bad in that? - No, for now, nothing. We just want to know a little more. Who is he, what does he do, who are his parents? Why? Is it that important to know all these things? It's up to you to tell me, but I forbid you to see him. Enough with all these prohibitions, father! Please, otherwise... Listen, my child. And stop treating me like I was still a child! You are seventeen years old! And you have no life experience! But, if you'll go on sending a body guard with me... Like this, father, I'll never grow up! Don't you read the newspapers! Robberies and kidnappings every day! I only want to protect you from all these things. I would want... I would like to live like all the other girls of my age! Is there anything you're missing? Everything! I'm missing everything, dad! I can't go on with all this control! With all these prohibitions! I don't care about having a nice house! For me, this house is empty! It's cold! It's a prison! And you are jailers! Yes! My jailers! Where's she going? Alessandra! Good morning, Miss. Shall I take you anywhere? No. I'm going to study at Patrizia's. She lives nearby. But, really... I have instructions to... - If I'll need you, I'll call you. - As you wish, Miss. What time is it? Thanks. Hi. Hi! Have you been waiting long? No, I've just arrived. Come on, climb up! But, in a couple of hours... a couple of hours, we'll have to return to Rome. Agreed? Yes! Of course. We'll sprint till there. - You aren't afraid, I hope? - No! - Hold tight! - And you, go slowly! Stop! Stop! What's the matter? Nothing. Something must have got into my eye. Is that place still far away? We're almost there. - Have you ever been on a rollercoaster? - Cut it out! Go slowly! So you're afraid, aren't you? Please, I told you to go slowly! Hold tight! We've arrived, Alessa. How is this place beautiful! - Really? You like it? - A lot. Such a pity not to be able to live here forever. What's preventing you?! Everything... beginning with school. And all the rest. So, where's that friend of yours? I don't understand. He should have been here, waiting for us. He's probably late. Shall we take a bath? You go. I've brought no costume. And then, I prefer drawing. Who knows when I'll be able to come back... to such a beautiful place. Here. Try again now. Not like that! Relax your hand. That's it. Like that. I thought it was easier. You must be patient. Come on, try again. That's it. God, how late it is! I have to go back home! Your friend surely won't come now. I'm sorry... Usually, he's very punctual. We can't wait for him any longer. Let's go! What could have happened to him? Nothing we can do... It won't start. What about me?! I must go back home! Right away! It's no use shouting. The next place is... miles away. And then?! Do something! Try to repair it! I don't have any clue... This is not even mine. You stole it, then. No. Let's say I borrowed it. How stupid of me to trust a guy like you! - But, Alessandra... - Stop! - Don't you come near me! - Why are you doing this? Because, I don't understand any of this! The friend that doesn't dhow up, the stolen bike... What could I know about my friend?! Something must have happened to him. Something unforeseen... As for the bike... Yes, I stole it. But this time, I did it for you. I wanted to impress you. Alright, but now, what? Listen, Michele... Today has been a very nice day... Thank you. But now I must return home. My father will call the police if I am not back. You can rest assured they won't ever find us here. What's in your mind? To stay here, forever. - As you told me. - Stop fooling around! - I am afraid. - What of? I'm afraid of you. Of me?! - Stop! - Alessandra! Don't move! What're you doing?! Come here! Alessandra! Where're you going?! You'll never find the road! Come back here! Alessandra! Come back! Everything's a joke! Alessandra! Come here, beauty! Don't move, don't move so I can take your picture. Hi. Who are you really? What do you want from me? To look at you. To talk to you. To be together. What need was there of all this mise-en-scène? This wouldn't have been possible in Rome. You're under a strict control. And I am who I am. It was useless expecting your parents to accept me. Are you still afraid? A little... Do I look like a kidnapper? I am afraid all the same. And then, it's the first time that... ... that... Even today we've been alone. The two of us. Alone. And nothing happened. Why didn't you ask me? Would you have come? No. What's with this smell? Oh my God, the fish! - You're distracting me! - You should have been more careful! Are you sure she went to Patrizia's? Yes. That's what she said going out? She said: "I'm going to study at Patrizia's" Patrizia lives very close from us. She's not at Patrizia's! Not one of her friends has seen her! Please, dear, calm down. - How can I? - Please. How can I? I'm sorry... it's the first time... And let it be the last time, understood? I don't want her going out alone! - You can go now, but stay available. - Yes, sir. - What do you intend doing? - What is done in such cases. Oh my God! You think that... I don't know! But Alessandra would have called us. She'd have let us know, one way or another, she'd be late. I was a fool. I'm sorry. Enough with that! You wanted to know me. Now, it's done. Yes, but it's different. I've almost kidnapped you. And what you must be thinking about me now... I don't like that. I don't like myself... like this. But I didn't know what to do. I didn't like it too. What are you saying?! You have everything! No. I've got too much, if any... Too much of a good thing. I'd like to live differently, but even I don't know how. - Are you tired? - Yes. Why? First, I haven't run away from home till now. Then... Then... It's for the first time I've been kidnapped. Then... Then, then, then... It's for the first time I'm sleeping out of home. Speaking of sleeping... Can I have the honor to show you to your room, Miss? Sir, honor granted. I've prepared everything for you. See, the blankets are clean. It's a little tough, but, after all. It won't be like your home, but definitely like mine. As a matter of fact, my place is even worse. At least, here, there's the sea. But you, where will you be sleeping? Wherever you want me to! Even here... on the ground! I understand... I'll sleep outside... close to the fire. Thank you. Alessandra... Are you still afraid of me? I don't know. Alessandra... I like you so much... Bye, good night. Elopement or kidnapping? This is what Michele meant when saying he'll write! Remember, ma'? You're right. He wanted to show us he was the best! You must give me credit. The kid did a good job. And you who wouldn't believe him! Robin Hood showed you! Yes, but, a kidnapping is a kidnapping! You've got to have what's needed. How come they've found him that quickly?! It says a florist saw him... And how well he saw him! Like he took his picture. Damn, how well it resembles him! Why didn't he confide in us? Who knows where he is? I think I know. Alfio. Think about him, son. Help him! Something might happen to him. You know the police doesn't take kidnappers lightly. Mama... Do you still want a new apartment? Yes, yes. But if it's too dangerous... I'll take care of it. That's our chance to roll in dough! We'll get fixed for our entire lives! Robin Hood, take me along too! For now, you're staying here. Then, you'll be needed too. Blessed heart of mine. Help him! Have these boys under your protection! O Ce'!... They're your sons too, right? Take care of them, damn it! Alessandra. Alessandra! It's late. Wake up! You must go to school. To school?! - So funny. - You got scared, right? How well I have slept... Michele. I must now call my parents. They must be looking for me all over Italy. We'll take care of that later. We'll find a solution. Eat, now. Where have you found these? At the supermarket, close by. Don't be a clown! They couldn't be poisonous, right? Try this one. What's the matter? Haven't you heard? Let's be quick! Maybe it's our ticket to Rome! Alessandra! Are you mad! See? Come, let's hurry up. Hold it still! Come on! Come on. Give it to me! And now, in the carriage! Come on, mount! No, I can't ride... It doesn't matter! All you have to do is hold yourself tight to me! - No... - It's like riding a bike. Only that, this time, I'm driving! You go. I'll stay here. Why? Let's go to Rome. I'll introduce you to my parents and friends. Then, if you want, we'll return here. Bye. Bye. We'll meet in Rome, then. Listen, Michele. I've thought about it. My parents are already worried... I mean, even if they worry a little longer, it won't be the end of the world. Right? - I think it won't be. - Let's go back on the beach. Alright. Let's go! - Shall we take the boat? - Yes. - Can I row a little? - No, let me. Only a little, please. Alright, come on. - One, two! - Two. One, two. One, two. Help! I knew it'd end like this. Coming! Alessandra. Did you think I couldn't swim? Try to keep pace with me, if you think you can! - Keep pace with you?! - Yes! I only need two strokes to catch up with you! I won! I didn't try. Then, let's race. - Come on, get up! - No. Do you need help, or can you do it by yourself? Come on! See that rock over there? Not fair! You started first! I've won... this time. Now it's me who hasn't tried. - Who can it be? - Well... It's coming towards us. Hide over there. Michele? Hey! - Michele, where are you? - Alfio? What are you doing here? Go turn the light on. I came to see how you were, if you needed anything. Mum was worrying. I'm fine. Why shouldn't I? This hut looks the same as before! Do you remember when I used to bring you here to go swimming? Back when you were a little kid. Alfio, tell me what you want. I wanted to tell you that I was sorry for the other day. I understood you were great. What did you do? The hell of a brother that I've got! One-man kidnapping! What are you talking about?! Kidnapping? Alfio, you got it wrong. What are you doing?! Didn't you tie her?! Are you nuts? If you lose her of your sight, she'll disappear! What the hell are you saying?! There's been no kidnapping. - We came here to... - I... To... I ran away from home. And all your brother did was to help me find a place. Oh, a pleasure trip then. And me coming to lend you a hand... There's no need! Thanks. Still, it's a good choice you made... Alfio! Please! Go! Was she, at least, a virgin? What? Are you bashful, sweetie? I'm his brother and what's his, is mine! Alfio! Don't touch me! Are you playing bashful? Leave her alone! Mind your place! Stop it! Shouldn't have done this! Big mistake. Enough! Stop it! Stop it! Michele! Michele! Oh, Michele... Let me go! Let me go! Let me go, bastard! Son of a bitch! Michele, no! No! Michele! No! Go away, or I'll kill you! Has he hurt you? It's nothing. - I love you. - Me too. You'll see the first ones to emerge will be the jackals, right, sir? I'm thinking. I know. Just tell anyone who calls to be careful with her left arm, 'cause it's plastered. - What?! - But she has no plastered arm! Exactly. The jackals don't know that. But the real kidnappers do. - There's an empty booth! Stop! - Silence! I saw it too! Move. Are you sure it works? Saw it on TV, in a giallo with Tomas Milian. Yes, a gia... Wait! Keep calm. Give me the headphones. Please keep him on the line as long as possible. Hello? Whom am I talking to? Who is it? I can't understand you! Hello? Hello? Tomas Milian my ass! Hello? Alessandra's father? - I am. - We've got your daughter. - How's she? - Well, up to now. But, if you want her to be even better, you'll have to do whatever I tell you. How do I know you're the real kidnappers? In a couple of days you'll have your proof. Treat her well. Please. She's just had her arm plastered. I don't want her to break it again! Don't you try to be funny! I've already told you, your daughter is in perfect health. But, if you call the police, I'll break both her arms! - Not the arms! - Go fuck yourself! Please, don't! I'll do whatever you want. Then start getting ready, 800,000 millions, in small notes. Unmarked! Wait for my instructions. Saw it? That's how it's done! This is awesome! Even Robin Hood would turn pale. Wait and see what's coming! I got a genius idea for this kidnapping. Let's go! - What did they say about Alessandra? - Don't worry, she's fine. They've identified the phone booth. The patrol cars have been alerted. It's a little strange... Usually, kidnappers aren't in such a hurry. They prefer letting their victims stew. Maybe we're dealing with amateurs. Amateurs... Could be, but... Let's hope not, or the risks will be bigger. Calm down, dear, calm down. Alessandra. Alessandra! Do you remember why we came here? The vase. It wasn't a pretext. This is my wedding gift. Michele. Thank you, my love. Look, my hand on your heart! You're funny. I've got an idea. This way, you won't forget me. What idea? You'll see! Here it is. I'm turning you into the most beautiful flower in my garden. Wait. Here it is. Do you like it? What flower is it? You'll see. Let me finish first, then say what you think. Don't move! Now, I'll draw another one on your back. Ready. Want to learn to paint? Show me what you can do. Come on! Begin! More colors! Add some more. Bravo! Put some there too. Bravo! Not bad for a beginning. Thank you, teacher. Now, on your back too. - Will you show me? - Wait. Turn around. There it is. Let me finish first. What are you drawing now? A staircase? Have you ever seen a flower run? Come on! Let's go! It's one of her shoes! You'll see, everything will be fine. Where could they have taken her?! All we can do is wait. God knows where she is now! Sand... A place by the sea. Are you sure there was nothing else in the package? - I don't know... a note? - I've already told you, only that shoe. Please, do something! Do you still want to pay the ransom? Of course. And I'd like you not to intervene until my daughter won't be free. A pity. If we'd act in agreement, we could get your daughter, save the money, and catch the kidnappers. Sir, I, I have no intention to sacrifice Alessandra's life. So I'll act on my own. Is that clear? Answer, quickly! Yes? Hello? Yes. Just a second. Tell me. At Villa d'Este. At six... tomorrow. Yes. Agreed. You heard too. Of course. I've heard, I've heard. Tomorrow at six, at Villa d'Este. Very clear, even in the details. Sir, I thank you, but, from now on, I'm the one to care of my daughter. As soon as she'll be free, you can do everything you want. Of course, I wish you luck. Thank you. - Madam. - Thank you. Have a good day. - Let's go, boys! - Here we go, sir. We'll see tomorrow. We'll solve the whole thing. - Take your time. - Goodbye. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Good afternoon. My car, quickly. Yes, immediately. But, excuse me, dear, wasn't it for tomorrow? Let me handle it. You'll see Alessandra soon. Be careful, my dear! Ready. The album of our memories is complete. Even when our story will have ended, I'll return here, to browse through it. But, between us, it can't end. Have you already forgotten we were married? Yes, but in the city, this marriage is not valid... Michele. Do you want it to end? - No, that's not what I said! - Answer me. Do you want it to end? How could you think such a thing?! It's only that... I'm very worried. Don't be! Please. I'll talk to my parents and they'll understand. And the, even if they won't understand, I'll be eighteen in a couple of months. I'm most of all worried about my brother. He's really mad! If he thinks I've kidnapped you... You think he might get us into trouble? Yes. Maybe it's better to return to Rome. But... how? The bike isn't working! I'll try fixing it. Could be a cable problem. Michele. Let's leave tomorrow. We haven't yet finished our honeymoon. Are we being followed? They're still there, glued to us. - Alright. Go to Piazza di Spagna. - Yes, sir. Now, I've got it! The call was only to throw us on a wrong track. Exactly. The real meeting is for today. - Is everything clear? - Don't worry. Be careful, everything depends on you. Go! Quickly! Quickly! - Be ready to follow the Mercedes. - What? Aren't we following him?! You really are naive. It's an old trick. How stupid not having thought about this earlier! Quickly, to the car! This must be a new trick! They've discovered who the boy in the portrait is. His name is Michele Tarantino and he lives at the Cinedromo. Got it. His brother is an old acquaintance of ours. Let's hurry. It was kid stuff! Say, Salvato', wasn't that easy? Damn, how they took the bait! Yes, but now we must hide it. - Let's hide it outside. - No, here, inside! Saw that on TV too? Yes, in the same movie with Tomas Milian! I can't trust you anymore. Something more robust would be better. The suitcase! Well done, ma' ! Ma' always has the best ideas! Here comes the safe! Let's go. - Here. - Give it. Easy, Salvato'! That's money! Have you seen so much money at once? Why, have you? God, I can already see that flat of mine! What's with those? Where are you taking it? They're for Michele. To convince him. You're right. My poor son... Bring him home to me as soon as possible. And the girl? She's a problem. She saw me. She'd recognize me anytime. You're not going to kill her, right? There's nothing else we can do, mother. Unfortunately... Are you nuts?! Stealing is one thing, murdering is another one! Alfio! Wait, Alfio! Mother. You take care of the new house. I don't want to pay the flat with an innocent's blood! I've already told you: there is no other way. Don't worry. I do clean jobs. Madonna mia ! Have you heard? What can you do, ma'? From now on... Let's go hide this. - Let's go. I'll take it. - No, I'll take it! - Leave it! - Let me help you! Leave it Salvato'! - Mother! - Here they are! Oh God! Were you leaving, madam? - Me?! - Going on a holiday? - Well, yes. Why? - May I? No, don't you worry, please! I could recommend a nice place, in the cool... My God... Ma', so the police had their eyes on us this whole time? Be careful with that. Ce', you were supposed to protect us! How careless of me! Bye, Ce'. Let's go. Obviously, Alfio is a go-between. In the meantime, the younger brother takes care of the girl. Who's this Alfio? Small fry, bag-snatching, small robberies. He might have tried his big hit, but he still is small fry. Contact the headquarters. Have the bike patrols ready. If things stand the way I think, we'd need the bikes more... - Hello? Headquarters? -...than the cars. Michele! Look! I've almost finished it. See how beautiful it is? It really is an Etruscan vase. It's authentic. Thanks. Your brother?! I don't get it... Don't be afraid. Hi. How is it going? Hi, Alfi'. What's new? Here. These are for you. Mother sends it. Damn, they're beautiful. Where did you get them? Come on. As if you didn't know. This is your money. You've really deserved it. Your father sends it. My father?! Then everything happened as I thought it will. You took the ransom, didn't you? Bravo, little brother. You're finally beginning to get it. We're rich, right? Of course. Know you scared me? I thought you didn't like money anymore. You'll see how happy mother will be when she sees us back home, the two of us. Of course, like in the old days. Michele... I'm sorry, but money is money. Sons of a bitch! Calm down! It was a mistake trusting him. Leave her alone. She can't escape anyway. So, what now? When do we set her free? Come on, Michele. She's merchandise better not returned. She knows us too well! No, she won't talk! Right, you won't talk? No, no... I won't talk. I've never seen you. Let me go... Please! And do you believe her? - And you, you won't talk. - I won't say anything! What if you later con us? Run, Alessandra! Run! Go away I said! Michele! Hey, shorty. You wanted to con me? Con your own blood? What has this stupid done to you? Eaten your brain? You know I can always say you were my accomplice? Who'd believe otherwise? So, make up your mind! I'm asking you for the last time. Are you coming with me or staying with her? Think, Alfio! She doesn't even know our names! And you can disappear when you wish, and as you wish. Get lost! Or I'll kill both of you! - Shoot then. - Don't be a fool! Shoot! What are you waiting for? Oh my God!There's blood! Blood! Remain where you are! Michele, we want the girl! Michele, let Alessandra go! Raise your hands and come towards us slowly! You are surrounded! Help me! Go! I'll never convince them I'm not into this! No! I'm not leaving you! Help me! I'll talk to the police! I'll explain everything! Go! It's useless! Michele, don't leave me! No, Michele! Well? You've got five minutes to give yourself up! Throw the gun on the ground! Otherwise, we'll shoot! I won't leave you alone! I've told you to go away! I'd rather they kill me, than going to prison! Then, they'll have to kill me too. - Michele! - Let's go. Michele! No, don't shoot! You might hit the girl. Let's go. Come, Michele. Point it towards me and stay close. Be careful! Let's go. Careful, my love! Alessandra, it's useless! No! I won't let go of you! There's nothing we can do! Let go of me! - Let me go! - No, no! Alessandra! Your wedding gift... Michele! Michele, what have they done?! Michele! My love! No! They are mad! No, no! No! Michele! No! Michele! - No, Michele! - Come on, Alessandra, it's over. I won't leave him! What're you doing? Leave him! He was not into this! Michele! Alessandra! How is she? She'll soon fall sleep. I've given her a sedative. Thank you. And then, Lake Lucerne, is the perfect place to relax. Not to think at anything. Who says I don't want to think? Alessandra! I've stayed too long without thinking. You go relax. I want to stay here! Having been kidnapped didn't teach you anything? I wasn't kidnapped! I've already told you what happened. I'll say it at the trial too. I love him! A lot! Giovanni! You risked being killed by that delinquent's brother! He's not a delinquent, dad! He's got a name! His name is Michele. Michele... And I love him a lot. But, Ale', my darling, this is madness. That boy is a thief... How can you think to live with a thief?! Same way as I have lived with you! Dad, I don't even know what is it that you do! All I know is you have money, lots of it! One day, I saw your name in the papers. They weren't saying nice things about you, or your deals! My "deals", as the envious call them, were good business. Those gave us a luxurious lifestyle that benefited you too, my dear daughter! And now, for a petty thief, I'm forced to hear our house was a prison for you! And I and your mother are your jailers! With your hunger for liberty, we are the talk of the town! In a full-blown scandal! Alessandra... We are worried about you. We'd like you to forget as soon as possible this nasty incident. I don't want to forget! You must forget him, you understand? You must! Even if I wanted to, I couldn't forget him. Do you know how much he wanted for that flat in Via dei Coronari ? - More than 100? - 150! - Excuse me, how much is this? - This one, 20,000. Listen, I can come down to 30,000 for the two of them. I'll make a discount... 25! Alright. 20,000 for both, and we don't talk about it. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Alessandra! - Hi! So? - Everything alright with the flat! I talked to the owner again: he'll rent it to you for 80,000 a month. Really? Thanks, Marco, you really are a friend! You were really lucky. - Would you like to see it? - I'd love to. - Let's go right away! - Alright. Oreste! Oreste! He won't give me the money! He coned us! Go back! Tell him I'll break his arms and legs when I get out! You'll see he'll give it! So? Hurry and get out! I can't take it anymore! Don't know which way to turn! Oreste! You got it? Think about it! I will! I will! Michele! Michele! Alessandra! Here I am! I can hear you, Alessandra! We got the flat! We can get in in one month! How are you? The flat will be ready when you'll get out! I've thought about it already! But you, how are you? Has the doctor seen you? What does he say? I'm fine! The doctor says everything's fine! And him? He's very fine! The lawyer talked to the judge! And maybe they'll manage to get you out a couple of days before! Michele! I'm missing you, Michele! The two of us are waiting for you! I love you! I love you so much, my dear! THE END
