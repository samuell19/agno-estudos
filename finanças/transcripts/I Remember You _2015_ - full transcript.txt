- Are you ready? - I feel confident. - You're a fine candidate, Leah. - I heard that only one fellow is being admitted this year. - I believe in you and I believe in your work more than anyone else. Good luck. - Okay. - I can't get married. I think, I think you love me. I think you love me but you, You think you love me but you don't know me, not at all. I'm a fucking monster. This guy's a fucking loser. No money. No money, no money, no money, no money. Spend it all, I spend it all on you. You think, you think you know me, but, you think you know me, but you don't. You don't know the real me. - We'll do a couple more of them. I think this is in the back already. - Please go ahead and state your name. - Samuel Davis. - Through my dissertation work entitled "Re-Engineered T Cells", I have been studying tumor immunotherapy with T-lymphocytes, with the objective to recognize and destroy malignant cells. The method used consists of genetically modifying T cells to specifically target cancer cells in patients with leukemia. - Great, whenever you're ready. - Jane... we can't get married. You think you love me, you don't know me. You don't know the real me. 'Cause the real me, Janie, is a fucking loser, a fucking loser! I'm a monster. I'm broke, Janie. I got no money, it's gone. And it's not because my job doesn't fucking pay me well, it's because fucking gamble all of it, before I ever even make it! - I look forward to the possibility of joining St. Gabriel's fellowship program and continuing my cancer studies at MORTONS lab. - The money we've been savin'... I blew the last of it yesterday. I'm sorry, baby. Chris, they offered me the role. The director, Golden in the room, he just offered it to me right on the spot. Yeah, call him to see if it's official. Just call him right now and see if it's official. All right, call, call, call! Yeah? - Dude, you've got it. You booked the Warner movie! - Are you serious? - Dude, I just got phone with Dave, he said you're playing as somebody big. I don't know what it is, man, but I'm sure -- - Woo hoo hoo hoo! Yeah! - Yeah! Hey, movie star! There he is. Look at you, man! How you been? - Yeah, I'm good. - Yes! - Yeah! - Promise, man, next time you walk in here, have some famous chick on your arm we won't recognize you. - Did he get the movie? - Tim shut up, he got the movie, of course he got the movie. Look how successful he looks right now! Hey guys, real quick. For those who don't know him, this is my very good friend Sammy. Today he booked his first major role. And as his manager, I will take 50% as per our contract. - Wow. - So guys, real quick, for those of you who don't care, for those of you who do care, for those of you who love him, let's hear it for Sammy. One, two, three, cheers, guys. - Another quick note, for those of you who'll be looking for him for the next 15 minutes, he'll be getting his ass kicked at the beer pong table by me, let's top that up! - Oh my God, you're still here? - Gosh, how many times have I asked you not to do that? - Sorry. In case you haven't noticed, it's midnight on a Friday. - And we got AP samples today. - Yes, I'm aware. Hey um, some of us are goin' to Pat's for beer if you wanna join. - What's that? - Never mind. - Shut up! - Get off, get off! No touching, no touching! Don't even act like you can beat me in a swimming, in a swimming thing because I swam for paradise valley. - Okay. - I'm gonna win. - You gonna place? - Oh! I am gonna be happy! - I lost at beer pong, but you're a loser at beer pong sometimes too and I'm always -- - Come on, shut the hell up! Who gives a shit? You can't stand a chance. - You're done, you're done, you're so done. You're so done. I'm like Aquaman, but my power is swimming. - You're so slow! - Gonna count to three! - I'm not ready! I'm not ready! I'm not ready! - Well, excuse me. - One! Wait, to the pier and back, a hundred bucks. - Two! - Watch your nuts, watch your nuts! Watch 'em, watch 'em! - And three! - Oh, no, no, no, no. - Watch out for the water, Sammy-o! - It's too cold, it's too cold, Sammy. I'm out. - What? - I'm out. - Come on! Yeah! Woo! Yeah, baby! Woohoo! - Stop it! - What's wrong? You alright? - Turn down the light. - Samuel? Are you ready? Let us know if you need more time. - How was the audition? You think you got the part? So you can really get out there and start to push yourself harder. Katie, don't start. - There's nothing wrong with asking. - It's not that easy, Katie. There are many talented actors out there! - Well, what if he's letting a big opportunity. You think you got the part? - One step at a time! He's still recovering. - We know that you're healthy. - It's not that easy, Katie. There are many talented actors out there! Won't you leave him alone now, please? He's still recovering, that's up to him. It's only been a few weeks! - So you can really get out there and start to push yourself harder. All you're doing is undermining his confidence! - I'm not undermining his confidence! - He's perfectly capable of getting back on track! - He'll get back on track when he's ready to get back on track! - How's everyone else doin' tonight? - Sammy, Sammy, Sammy! Did you get my e-mail, bud? - Uh, yeah. - Yeah yeah, the e-mail. The audition contracts, you got that? - Mm-hm. - Yeah. You sure you're up for it? - Yeah. - Alright. We gotta get you back out there at some point, so... you know, I guess it's up to you. What's up, Jackie? - Hi, guys. - Hi! She said she needed a ride home, if you're... Great. Sammy. Sammy, get back here. Sammy, where are you goin'? - It's too loud! - Okay what about Jackie? Are you gonna take Jackie home? - No! - Why not? What are you, a jackass? Dude, you could use a girlfriend right now. - I don't need a girlfriend, okay? I just, I don't feel good tonight, that's it! - You know what dude? You need to get over this, okay? I get it, it sucks. You got passed on a major movie role, I get it. But dude, this piss-poor attitude of yours is not getting anyone, anywhere. - I'm fucking trying, you asshole! - Okay, well try harder, Sammy! - Nurse. Nurse! - Hello? - Is this Leah? It's Samuel. I don't know if you remember me. - Of course I do. - I was gonna call before. - Oh, that's okay. I understand. - Do you wanna, maybe grab some coffee? - Sure. - How about today? Around five o'clock? - Yeah, that works. I'll call you after work. - Thank you. Leah? Hey. I'm, I'm sorry, I don't do well with crowds. Not lately. - It's late, I need to get going. - Yeah. - It's nice seeing you again. - You still feel like coffee? I have coffee, or uh, ah, shoot. Sorry, tea. I have coffee or tea. I just live a few blocks away if that's okay. - Tea sounds good. - I'll go put the tea on. - Yeah, okay. - They give me headaches. - Oh, I see. - Here. - Thank you. - I've got, um... some sugar, or honey? - Oh no, no that's okay, I don't eat sugar. - Oh, really? - Yeah. It's bad for you. - Um, have a seat. - Thanks. Aren't you having coffee? - Oh, I hate coffee. - Oh. - Uh, thank you. For what you did. For risking your life like that. - Oh. You would have done the same thing. - I don't know. - So have you seen someone about the headaches? - Oh, uh. Yeah, but there's nothin' wrong. Or, I mean, they don't... nothing... they don't find anything wrong. Uh, so you're a doctor? - Yeah, mm-hm. Well, I'm more like a research scientist. Well, I'm studying specific cells of the immune system. - What for? - The goal is to find new therapies. And hopefully, cures to certain types of cancer like leukemia and, you know. - Why? Not "why do you try to cure cancer", why did you... you know, like. - Uh, are you like secretly investigating me or something? - No, sorry. - It's okay, I don't mind if you are. - This is so weird. I just, I feel like I know you from somewhere. - Um, well the brain is actively changing perception, that's one explanation. Um. Um, I should go. I need to get back to the lab. - Yeah. Can I see you again? - Yeah. Samuel, um... thank you for the tea. - Yeah. - I'm glad I came. - Me too. - Okay. Bye. - Hello? - Samuel? - Leah? - Did I wake you? - Uh, uh, no. - I'm sorry to call so early, I thought that perhaps you were awake. - Yeah. I am. - Would you like to grab a cup of tea, maybe? - Yeah. - Great. I have time until seven. - Um, what time is it now? 5:30. - Um. Yeah, where were you thinking? There you go. - I'm not used to this. - Used to what? - Like just, you know, hanging out? - Too much work? - Not enough time. - Well, you look like you work too much. - So, you are an actor. - I, yeah tried to. - Have you been in many movies? - Some. Are you sure we haven't met before? - I don't think so. - Maybe we ran into each other once and I was the only one paying attention. - Maybe. - You play the piano. - No. - Oh. Well, you have beautiful hands. Um, can I get you some water? - No thanks. - Alright. - I'll be right back. - Okay. Do you still draw? - I don't know. - This may sound really strange, it really makes no sense. - That's alright. Go ahead. - I seem to have developed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. - I see. And what makes you think that? What are your symptoms? - Well I, um... a fear of water has developed in me. I'm terrified of water now. - Can you give me any examples? - Um. I haven't taken a shower in four weeks? I can't wash my hands anymore, I use sanitizer only. It's deeply affecting my work, as you can imagine. I made an appointment to come and see you last week. I was hoping it would get better, however I haven't noticed any improvement since. - So, I'm going to give you a mild tranquilizer. To help you cope with your anxieties. And then, we'll take it from there. Okay? - Good morning, Leah. - Good morning. I apologize for being late. - Leah, we're eager to hear about the progress on your research. - Yes. By analyzing the results obtained in my study, conducted in mice, we can conclude that chimeric antigen receptors have successfully overcome tolerance in mice by allowing T-cells to respond to cell surface antigens. However, targeting functioning immune T cells to cancer cells and maintaining them in patients still remains a challenge. - Correct. To date there are no direct results indicating that this concept is even effective at targeting cancer cells. - Yeah well, perhaps there's more to it. - We understand your enthusiasm with this therapy, Leah, but until we can prove that the infused T cells kill tumor cells, we can't draw any conclusions. - Look, we often disregard treatments and options that could benefit a patient's well-being based on numbers and figures? I mean, we might not be killing cancer cells but we could certainly be improving the patient's quality of life. - Leah, let's not forget that quality of life is not science. - Excuse me. - Hi. - Hi. - Sorry to just, uh... show up like this here. I, um... well, I wanted to just give you this. I wanted to give it to you in person. - Thank you. You didn't have to. - I know, but I just wanted to. Oh, don't. Or, sorry. Can you just wait? Open it later? Sorry. - Sure, no. It's good. - Um, can I give you a ride home? - It's just a couple of blocks. - Could I walk you home? - Alright. Thank you. - Yeah, no problem. - I should get going. - Sure. - Yeah. Okay. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Samuel! Would you like to come in? Can I offer you anything to drink? - Uh, no thanks. No. You said you didn't play. - Oh, I don't. It belonged to my parents. They passed away so I've just kept it since. - Oh, sorry to hear that. - It's okay. It was a long time ago. I hardly remember them. - Have you read all of these? - What's that? - Have you read all these books? - Yeah. Um. You should probably go, it's been a really long day for me. - Sure. Can I ask you something? - Yeah. - Why'd you risk your life for a stranger? - I had to. - Hey. Leah. - Not now, okay? We got new samples this morning. - It's important. - What? What? What? - That's what I'd like to know. Are you sick? - No! Of course not! - Leah, look at yourself. Everyone's noticed, not just me. Leah, careful! - Leah? Leah, you're dehydrated. We're giving you some fluids, alright? - Hey, Leah. - Hey. Thanks. - You overworked yourself. And your body eventually catches up, you know that. - I know something happened the day of the accident. Something went off in my brain. - Give yourself a break. It's only been a few weeks and you've had a lot to deal with and I don't just mean the accident. - Sorry. - Hey. - I need to talk to you. - Yeah? Leah. Have you ever felt anything like this before? - You don't know me. - That doesn't change how I feel. - Do you believe in coincidences? - No. - I do. I do and I... I think that we met by accident and that given the circumstances, we're idealizing this. Us. Look, I have to focus on my work, I can't afford any distractions right now. - Distraction? Is that what I am? Do you feel nothing? - We're different. - Are we? - I can't do this. - What were you doing that day? The morning of the accident. - I was jogging. - Down at the pier that early. - Yeah, I couldn't sleep. - See! It's not a coincidence that you and I met! I'm standing here because of you! - Look, I'm sorry. - Here you go. I suggest, that through hypnosis we see if any memories come up that can help us understand your fears. - Dr. Henderson, I was hoping that you suggest a more traditional approach. - I understand. Hynotherapy is an option I like to explore in cases such as yours, and you don't have to decide -- - But okay, if you can't help me, that's something that I need to know now! - Unfortunately, there's no medication or treatment on the market that can make it go away immediately. - Hey, hey, excuse me. Excuse me, hey! Can you read this? - Uh. Look, sorry man, I don't have the time. - Okay, can you please just, fine! Buddy can you just do me a favor and -- - I have a family, man! - Good morning, Leah. Come join us? We decided to gather here this morning because it seemed to be the most suitable place, to congratulate our new St. Gabriel's Cancer Research Institute fellow... Michael. You've been awarded St. Gabriel's post-graduate fellowship. Congratulations. Excuse me. My office. Thank you. - I'm sorry. It was not up to me. A good friend of mine, is lookin' for a research assistant. Like you, he is currently studying tumor immunotherapy with stem cells. He's an exceptional scientist who could eventually sponsor your own research. The position doesn't pay much and he is based in Vancouver. I've already told him about you. He is considering other strong candidates. But if you're willing to drop out of school and relocate immediately, the position is yours. I'm sorry, this is best that I can do. - Okay. - I'm sorry. I'd like to give hypnosis a try. - Just remember, hypnosis doesn't work for everyone. Some people are able to reach a deep place of relaxation and other people aren't. So try not to let your mind judge. Just let yourself experience it, and you can analyze everything later. Are you ready? - Yes. - Okay, good. Go ahead and just close your eyes. And we're going to start by focusing on the breath. Just inhaling, and exhaling. That's it, and inhale. And exhale. You don't have to think. You don't have to listen. You don't have to do anything, except allow yourself to lie on that couch, feeling warm, relaxed, and comfortable. It's now time to begin the journey backwards. I want you to go back to your childhood. Back to the time when you were eight years old. Whatever comes into your mind is fine. Just let yourself experience it. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. What do you see? Where are you? - In my room. - What do you see? - My parents. I miss them so much, I wish they were here with me. - I want you to go back now. Go back to the time when your parents were alive. Can you see them? - No, I can't. I can't see anything. - Go further back in time. What do you see? Anything that comes to your mind. - Ended the German government. Stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock. - A living room. - Do you know where you are? - It's my house. - Can you see yourself? - Yes, but I look different. - Is your name 'Leah'? - Elsa. My mother is here, with Daniel. He's going to live with us now. - What else do you see? - Daniel cannot go out. - Why not? - He's Jewish. We're playing music so they don't hear us. - Move forward in time. Where are you now? Outside. - How old are you? - 19. Daniel and I, are going to get married. We're going to elope. - I feel like I know you from somewhere. - What happens next? - Oh my God, the water's coming in. There's a storm, the house is filling with water. It's filling very quickly, we don't know where to go. - Everything's gonna be fine. We will always be together. - Daniel! Daniel! Daniel! Daniel! - Leah, you are no longer drowning. You are safe now. You no longer need to fear water. - Samuel? Samuel? Samuel? - I didn't ask you to save me. - You shouldn't be drinking like this. - No, really? Well, what should I be doin'? Huh? I'm stuck here but, it's not, it's not me! Do you have any idea what that's like? I wish that I could just thank you and move on, but this is hell! You know, you're right. You and I, it's just a coincidence. - You don't remember me, do you? - Please go now. - Samuel. - Leave! - Hey, I need your help. What do you know about genetic memory? - If we were to demonstrate that long-term memories are built in the brain by creating and strengthening connections between neurons, and that these connections join neurons up into a complex network that can recreate memories even years later, this would be a valid theory. However, the molecules in these neural connections are replaced every few weeks. Okay, um, okay. Okay, think about, okay? Think about how long lasting memories can be if they are stored by such an impermanent medium. - What if your consciousness does not cease to exist when we die? - And where does consciousness go between lives? I mean, even if we were to believe that DNA stores our memories and that we pass them on to our children that way, you would need to be genetically linked to the person whose life you were regressed to. - Wait, what if instead, consciousness is reborn as someone else who can then access those memories from the previous life? - When and how would it enter the new body and how would you even prove that? - Yeah. What I saw... what I remembered... it felt real. - You could have been reacting to environmental stimuli. Hey. Hey, you know better. Don't add emotion to the science. Yeah. You're right. - Yes. Yes, I can understand your frustration, Samuel. The symptoms that you're experiencing are, are real. It takes a series of specific tests to properly diagnose and treat it. So I'd like to start by having you examined by a neuropsychologist. Who'll help us better determine the, the degree of your injury and uh, and we'll take it from there. - I love you. I always have. You and me... we're meant to be together. I love you. Always have. You and me, we're meant to be together. It wasn't the first time I saw you. It was the first time you looked at me. - Hey Samuel, it's me, Leah. I was just... I'm leaving. I've been offered a job in Vancouver. - The mailbox you have called is full. - Hi, we'll be ready for you in 15. - Okay, good. - Samuel? - I remember you.
