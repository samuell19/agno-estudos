Baloney. You were just being gentlemanly and suave, and French. Forgive me. Some habits are hard to break. I just want you to treat me like an equal. Then why didn't you sleep with one eye open and wake me at two in the morning? I can't argue with you on an empty stomach. -I got the bike working. -Oh, great!

Ha! It's a lot more fun than shopping at the supermarket. Oh. -What's next on your list? -Uh, scallions. -May I suggest instead shallots? -But the recipe says scallions. To me, shallots are more delicate. Pierre, the recipe only says one tablespoon. Won't the flavor get lost? Not if you use sweet butter for your sauce. If I may suggest. Pierre, your food is the best and I appreciate your help, but Chef Antoine has got me so confused. I don't know. I really don't know what to do. Well, uh, if I may suggest, you could purchase both the scallion and the shallots, and try them both. Pierre, my final exam is tomorrow morning. I don't have time to experiment. Of course you do. You can use the kitchen at Let Petit Ritz after my dining room closes. Oh, Pierre, a thousand mercis . -Oh... -[STUTTERING] Don't mention it. Heh. My cuisine is your cuisine.

They nursed my spirit and then-- GK, you don't have to say this. Tootie, let the man create. -Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. -Merci. They nourished my spirit with the milk of new kindness.
