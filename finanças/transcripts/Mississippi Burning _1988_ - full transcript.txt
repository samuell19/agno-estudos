Just read the file, Mr Anderson. I can do without the cabaret. You don't like me much, do you, boss? Sure I like you. I just don't share your sense of humour. Sometimes that's all you got left. How long you been in the bureau? Three years. Right out of college, huh? No. From the Justice Department. Kennedy boy. Now I see. No, I don't think you do see. Let's get this thing straight. I haven't had a pimple in years. I shave every morning. I even go to the bathroom by myself. So you can quit this "boss" stuff. They put me in charge because I've been through this before. - Birmingham? Montgomery? - Oxford. I was with Meredith at Ole Miss. Got hit in the head with a brick, so they gave you a promotion, right? No. Shot in the shoulder. Well, at least you lived. That's important. No, Meredith lived. That's what's important. What's got four eyes and can't see? - What? - Mississippi. ♪ Never, never, never I say ♪ ♪ Because the Ku Klux Klan is here to ♪ - Big building for a small town. - Yeah. Howdy. Good morning. My name's Alan Ward. I'm with the FBI. Federal Bureau of Integration? In that get-up, you ain't exactly undercover, are you, now? We're here to see Sheriff Stuckey. Sheriff's right busy now. You'll have to wait or come back some other time. We'll wait. Listen to me, you backwoods shit-ass, you... You got about two seconds to get the sheriff out here, or I'm gonna kick the goddamned door in, okay? Well, hell, looks like we got some company. Some Hoover boys come down to visit. - How you doing? - Good. I'm Sheriff Stuckey. Rupert Anderson. Rupert? We been expecting you. I assume you met my deputy, Mr Pell? Sure did. You down here to help us solve our nigger problems? No. It's just a missing-person case. Well, come on. Say, you gonna want your boy in on this? Sheriff, I'm Special Agent Ward. I'm in charge of this case. We think it might be a little more serious than missing persons. I don't think so, boy. In fact, you know what I think it is, it's a publicity stunt cooked up by that Martin Luther King fella. Come on. At around 3:00 p.m., Deputy Pell says he arrested the three boys for speeding. He held them in jail until 10:00 p.m., and then released them. They drove off. He says he followed them as far as the county line and never saw them again. Why didn't they make a phone call? Why should they? Mr Anderson, these boys were trained activists. They're taught to check in every hour, and if they're arrested, the moment they're released from custody. The hotel's two minutes from the jail. They could have phoned from the lobby. It just doesn't follow. Maybe they went for a beer. Not these boys. The civil rights office in Rossville started making calls as soon as they didn't check in. The sheriff's office here said they had no idea where the boys were. First lie. By who? The sheriff's office or the civil rights office? Who would you believe? Mr Ward, I don't know if you knew it or not, but I was a sheriff in a little Mississippi town just like this. Yes, I'm aware of that, Mr Anderson. Well, lying just don't come into it. We were right on the border, 10 miles from Memphis, and a million miles from the rest of the world. Now, if a sheriff in a little town like this says that's what happened, then that's what happened. Let's go eat. We're full up right now, honey. You all wanna wait a while? Is the wait worth it? We're not full for nothing, sugar. You all want to look at a menu while you wait? - Sure. - Thank you. Well, what you all gonna do, wait or leave? We're gonna wait because we want to be near you. There's some empty seats down there. Mr Ward. That's the coloured down there. Don't even think about it. There's some people over here getting ready to leave right now. Aren't you hungry, Mr Anderson? Good afternoon. Looks good. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? I'm looking for some information. I ain't got nothing to say to you, sir. Just a few questions. I ain't got nothing to say to you, sir. The civil rights boys came here to propose setting up a voter registration clinic. Before the locals got a chance to say yes, the Klan burned them down. Give a man a vote, but don't let him use it. That's the way it works. What'd their office in Rossville have to say? They confirmed that the boys came back here to apologise to the congregation. Sorry you folks didn't get to vote. I suppose most of you never knew you even had one. Now you got no place to go on Sunday. Apparently, after they came back here, they talked to some locals down the road. I think that's where we should start. Well, you can talk to them, but they won't talk to you. These people have to live here long after we're packed up and gone. They'd rather bite their tongue off than talk to us. Bureau procedure, Mr Anderson. The church caught fire and you ran home, is that correct? Yes, sir. And then the four white men stopped you? Yes, sir. And these four white men attacked your husband? Yes, sir. But you can't identify them? No, sir. Did you report this to the police? No, sir. But you told the civil rights boys what happened? Yes, sir. Ma'am, did they tell you where they were going after that? No, sir. Nothing? No, sir. All right. Thank you, ma'am. You're welcome. Come on, boy. Open up. Your brother Hollis here, Fennis? Yes, sir. Well, wake his ass up. We want to see him. - Why? - Just wake him up, boy. Why? What's the matter? There you are. Come here, boy. Hollis. Hollis. Get your ass back here, you fucking nigger. Hollis. Hollis. Shit. We better not catch you talking to the FBI. Or you'll be dead, boy. Real dead. You admire these kids, don't you? Don't you? I think they're being used. I think they're sent down here in their Volkswagens and their trainers, just to get their heads cracked open. Did it ever occur to you that maybe they believed in what they were doing? Did it ever occur to them they were gonna end up dead? Maybe. In Washington they sure as hell knew, didn't they? Some things are worth dying for. Well, down here they see things a little differently. People down here feel some things are worth killing for. Where does it come from, all this hatred? You know, when I was a little boy, there was an old Negro farmer lived down the road from us, name of Monroe. And he was... Well, I guess he was just a little luckier than my daddy was. He bought himself a mule. That was a big deal around that town. My daddy hated that mule. His friends always kidded him that they saw Monroe ploughing with his new mule. And Monroe was gonna rent another field now that he had a mule. One morning that mule just showed up dead. They poisoned the water. After that, there was never any mention about that mule around my daddy. Just never came up. One time we were driving past Monroe's place and we saw it was empty. He'd just packed up and left. Gone up north or something. I looked over at my daddy's face and I knew he'd done it. He saw that I knew. He was ashamed. I guess he was ashamed. He looked at me and he said, "If you ain't better than a nigger son, who are you better than?" Do you think that's an excuse? No, it's not an excuse. It's just a story about my daddy. Where does that leave you? With an old man who was so full of hate that he didn't know being poor was what was killing him. Get the light. Get the light. You all right? I guess they know we're here. Now you know what you're getting into. I'm going to call Washington. I need more agents. Would it make any difference if I say that's exactly the wrong thing to do? No. The whole place for $75 a month. It's private. It's central. It's perfect. There's room for 100 more agents. 200, maybe. More on the balcony. We're just trying to find the three boys, Mr Anderson. I'll take all the help I can get. When's the show start? Who's the big shot? That's the Klan. No pointy hats, but plenty of pointy heads. Let me run a check on the plates. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Anderson. Say hello to our mayor, Mr Tilman here. How do you do, Anderson? Mr Mayor, Mr Barber. Well, this looks like the place to be. Even for me. Yep. Nothing like a barber shop for jawing your socks off. Where you from, Anderson? Thornton, Mississippi, sir. Just a spit from Tennessee. Well, then you must know how we all feel down here. We don't take to outsiders telling us how to live our lives. And I'm here to tell ya, our nigras were happy, till those beatnik college kids came down here stirring things up. Before that, there wasn't anybody complaining. Nobody dared. We got a real peaceful community down here, Anderson. Course, they're just like any other folks, I reckon, when you push them too far. The way I figure it, it's like three sticks of old dynamite. You shake it up, and we'll be scraping bodies off the street. I'm just here to investigate the missing three kids, ask questions. If this all boiled down to gravy, there wouldn't be enough to cover a chicken-fried steak. Them kids you're looking for? I'll bet you a shiny new dime they're sitting in Chicago now, drinking a cold beer and having a big laugh about all the commotion they stirred up here. Well, I sure hope so. You can tell your bosses people got the wrong idea about the South. You know what I'm talking about. Everybody running around ragged, backwards, illiterate, eating sow-belly and corn pone three times a day. Simple fact is, Anderson, we got two cultures down here. White culture, and the coloured culture. That's the way it always has been. That's the way it always will be. The rest of America don't see it that way. The rest of America don't mean jack shit. You in Mississippi now. Oh, that's for sure. What's the score, Mr Barber? St. Louis on top, five to nothing. What inning is it? Bottom of the seventh. You like baseball, Anderson? Yeah, I do. You know, it's the only time a black man can wave a stick at a white man and not start a riot. Sir? We checked on the plate, sir. Clayton Townley. Townley. Grand Wizard of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. That's him. And we have a lead on the car. A Choctaw on the reservation thinks he knows where it is. I'm waiting for a call. Good. You have your appointment for next Tuesday, right? See you then. Bye-bye. You gonna go to... Afternoon, ladies. Can I help you? Well, yes, you can. I tell you, I hate the way I look. You know? What do you think? A permanent wave, maybe? Or a bleach job? That looks good. Was it done in here? No. Jackson. A wig's your only hope, hon. You won't be able to do much with that cue ball. Thank you. If you wanna ask us some questions, this is where you'll hear it all. Well, matter of fact, I do. I was wondering who that gentleman was that just drove in over there? I know that isn't President Johnson. His name's Townley. Clayton Townley. Are you one of them FBI gentlemen? Yes, ma'am, I am. Well, I think it's a shame if those two kids are dead, but I hope you find them. Thank you. Actually, it's three kids missing. There's a coloured kid also. Do you honestly think your people'd be down here if it weren't for the white boys? - Maybe not, Miss... - Mrs Pell. Her old man's Ray Stuckey's deputy. But I'm single. Look out. Here they come. Hollis? Get back. Move out of the way. Move over, boy. We'll take care of this. It's a local problem. We'll handle it. We don't need your damn help. It ain't right having blood on Main Street. How'd that look on the TV news? - Okay, easy. - Get up. Ok, I got him. I got him. Get out of the way, now. He's the kid from the diner. Think twice before you talk to coloured kids with an audience. They're sending a message from the boss in Tupelo, and you know it. I know it, yes. Clayton Townley, chief pointy head. Yeah, that's right. How did you know? Bureau procedure, Mr Ward. Try it sometime. We did. We found the car the kids were driving. Good morning. Good morning. Two beer cans, a Coca Cola bottle, a green plastic bottle, a badly burned wristwatch stopped at 12:45, set of keys. No bodies. I want the entire area searched. Every inch. Yes, sir. It's a big swamp. Every inch, Mr Bird. I guess they never left Mississippi. Yeah, they're dead. They're dead. Mr Bird? Yes, sir? There's a telephone at the truck stop. Get to it, get on it and get me 100 more men here by morning. - 100? - 100. Bureau people, sir? I don't care if it's the army. I want this entire swamp searched. Yes, sir. Don't do it, Mr Ward. You'll just start a war. It was a war long before we got here. You too. Wake up. Come on. Get the fuck out of here, nigger. Go on. Sir? The sheriff's alibi is solid. He was playing poker with his wife's brother and cousins. The whole time? No, for three hours. He lost $11.38. Another thing, sir. We're having a little trouble with the motel manager. What kind of trouble? He wants us out. He says we're bad for business. Buy it. Sorry, sir? Buy it. The motel. How high can I go? Whatever it takes. Today in Jessup County, Mississippi, amidst the violence of this week, the eyes of the the nation are fixed on the search for the missing civil rights workers. I think it's all a big hoax. But if they are in that swamp, then they asked for it. Naval reserves are in to join scores of FBI agents in their search for the missing men. They planned the whole thing. They're in New York laughing at us Mississippi folks. - You think it's a hoax? - Yeah, I think so. I think it's a big hoax. They ain't gonna find nothing. Civil rights leaders are optimistic as to the young men's whereabouts, but privately, there is mounting concern they will ever be found alive. They came looking for trouble and found it. This is Marek Barlbobi, Network News. Jessup County, Mississippi. Sheriff Stuckey? Tell you what I think they ought to be looking up in Canada for them boys instead of our swamps around here. I'll tell you something else. I think it's a publicity stunt dreamed up by these NAACP people. NAACP people? Yeah, NAACP. It stands for niggers, alligators, apes, coons and possums. Tell you what you got. You got your NAACP, you got your SNCC, you got your COFO... You know what all that mess is? B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T. You got it? Sheriff, will this be a federal case? There'll be a time when we don't gotta say, "Good morning, sir, Mr Sheriff." Maybe there'll be a time when we won't have to say, "Mr Stuckey." One day there'll be a time when we just say "Stuckey" or "Sheriff." And one day there'll be a time when the sheriff won't even be a white man. Hello. I wonder if I could ask you a few questions? I don't suppose you know what kind of flower these are? I been seeing them all over the place. I never saw such a darn pretty plant. They're trumpet pitchers. Trumpet pitchers. They're beautiful. They really are. They don't smell so good, but they're pretty. It's nice talking to you. Sorry about interrupting your meeting, but we can't get anybody to talk to us. They "zip up," like my mama used to say. People don't wanna talk to you because they're afraid it'll get back to the law. We are the law. Not around here you ain't. We were sent to find out what happened to those three boys. They were here to help you. It ain't coloured folks you should talk to. Who should we be talking to? Come on, Aaron. You should start with the sheriff's office. Why ain't you afraid? How come you ain't? Aaron. Aaron? Come on, son. Here's the pitch. Swing and a line-drive base hit. Another runner's home. On to the next pitch by the ruffled Bob Gibson. He is upset. Ron Hunt singled to centre. Hickman passed third and scored the Mets' second run. Hunt holds on at first. Mets now lead 2 to 1. The next one up will be Joe Christopher who struck out and popped out to Boyer. He's 0 for 2, and hitting a mere .252... Good evening, Mrs Pell. I'm Agent Ward. He's Agent Anderson. We're with the FBI. Is your husband home? We'd like to have a word with him. You all come in, then. It's the FBI gentlemen, Clinton. They want to ask you some more questions. You want me to put your dinner in the oven? Leave us alone. Mind if I take a seat? What's so goddamn important you got to bother me at home? Well, I just wanted to run through, once again, your movements on June 21st. June which? June 21st. Now, deputy, we both know what day we're talking about. Let's be civilised and the sooner you can get back to your ball game and we can return to Washington DC. Please, don't let me interrupt you. It's just when you've heard a question asked a dozen times, it gets kinda boring. Yeah, I guess so. You don't eat together? He works funny hours. You think that's odd? No. I work funny hours myself. I eat when I'm hungry, he eats when he can. - Can I get you something? - No, no thanks. This is a nice house. How long have you lived here? I was born here. But my father lost the house in a poker game a long time ago. We've been paying rent ever since. It's a wicked game. Poker. Wicked. Mr Anderson? It was nice talking to you. Guess I gotta go. Them pork chops still any good, honey? Bring me a beer. Good night. Let you get back to your baseball. You know what they say? The only game a black man can wave a stick... I already heard that one. Fifty minutes of his alibi hinges on his wife. You talked to her. What's she like? She's a nice lady. Tell me, Mr Anderson. How does a woman like that end up... With Shithead in there? You know what these small towns are like. A girl spends all her time in high school looking for a guy to marry, then spends her whole life figuring out why. Something's wrong. He's too confident. Did you see the wedding photograph? His three usher pals hooked their thumbs in their belts with three fingers pointing down. So, what is that? Some sort of Masonic thing? No. KKK. I know you ain't drunk. I won't argue. I'm not drunk. I'll take you where you can sleep it off. All right. Hold up. - Who's driving? - Watch your head. Hi. There was a couple things I needed to check with you. My husband's not here. Actually, it was you I wanted to talk to you. Me? Well, you better come in, then. Just take a minute. My boss, he's kind of a pain. College kid. He has to dot all the I's, cross all the T's. What do you want to ask me about? It's a time thing. A few things we're not clear about... Should I put your flowers in some water while you're here? Yeah. Actually, they're for you. They're beautiful. They are pretty, aren't they? They don't smell so nice, but they're pretty. Would you like anything? Some tea? Yeah, I would. Thanks. Oh, don't you look at that. It's a terrible photo. Oh, I don't know about that. Is this recent? No. I wish. Well, this sure looks recent to me. We were married 14 years ago. Are you kidding me? No, that... Come on. You take sugar? Sure do. You know, I grew up in a town like this. You were smart enough to leave. Why didn't you? "For better or for worse." How about you? Are you married? Two. Well, I was, as I remember. It didn't last very long. I was never home. I guess she got fed up with phone calls from Miami and postcards from Des Moines. There was always a guy around. Any guy that could spare the time for a movie or a beer or a quarter for the jukebox. She left. How about you? Oh, you know the South, Mr Anderson. You leave high school and marry the first boy that makes you laugh. Hey, your husband's quite a guy. You know, my boss has this thing about an hour, 50 minutes to be exact, that your husband says that he was with you. And I guess he was. Guess he was. Well, that's a pity. That means I don't have an excuse for hanging around here any more. Well... Thank you for the iced tea. Thank you for the flowers. Sure. Do you know what kind they are? I heard they're called trumpet pitchers. Oh, that's right. My daddy used to call them ladies from hell because they're car... Carnivorous. - That's the word? - Yeah. See, that pretty colour's the bait. Insects just home in there and wham, they're dead even before they got their shoes off. Maybe I should've picked something something else.

You understand me? How are Negroes treated in Mississippi? They're treated about fair. About as good as they ought to be. If you ask me, niggers around here have been treated awful bad for a long time. I think Martin Luther King's one of the leaders. I mean, J. Edgar Hoover said he was a Communist. They had proof to that effect, but I don't know that for sure. I hadn't seen it myself, but that's what they say. Hey, you really wanna find that nigger? They say we've got to eat together and use the same bathrooms as the niggers. That's awful hard for some Mississippi folks to do. They're not like us. They don't take baths. They stink. They... They're nasty. They just not like white folks. What do you think has happened to the three boys? Dead. Just as dead as they can be. It feels so good. - Is she asleep? Is she? - Yeah. Oh, my Lord. I'm sorry I woke you up. Bye, hon. I'll be a couple hours. All right. Well, Mary, is that your Betsy's kid? Yeah, she's growing up real quick, isn't she? Come on. Tuesday will be just fine on those, Mary. Funny. Their kids are so cute. - Here we go. - Is that back on me again? If the entire Secret Service couldn't protect the president of the United States, how the hell are we supposed to protect a few nigras? It ain't nothing but a bunch of low-life white trash drinking too much cheap alcohol. More like paint thinner and snake juice, because this state's as dry as a Martini and we got the alcoholics to prove it. Give me a little room here. Excuse me. Excuse me, Bob. - Is this okay? - Your name, please? Clayton Townley, local businessman. Are you, sir, a spokesman for the White Knights of the KKK? I told you. I'm a businessman. I'm also a Mississippian and an American. I'm sick and tired of the way many of us Mississippians are having our views distorted by your newspapers and on TV. So let's get this straight. We do not accept Jews because they reject Christ. Their control of the international banking cartels are at the root of Communism. We do not accept papists because bow to a Roman dictator. We don't accept Turks, Mongols, Tartars, Orientals or Negroes. We're here to protect Anglo-Saxon democracy and the American way. Thank you, sir. Lester, you are living proof that cousins shouldn't fuck. What I was trying to say... there's this coloured boy. He wants to play football for Bear Bryant over at Alabama. So Bear says, "I'm gonna give you a try-out." What colour was he? What's he gonna run with? A watermelon? And he'll keep on running too. "Ok, boy" he says. "You get down there on one goal line." He puts a whole team on the other goal line. He throws the boy the ball and says... Are you open? You gotta be a member to drink here. Member? A member of what? A member of the social club. I thought you'd just buy me a beer. Give him a beer, Frank. Nice to be back in a dry county again. When I was sheriff, half my take-home pay was from collecting taxes on illegal jukes like this. Probably works the same here. I would think you haul in a tidy penny here, winking at the bootleggers. I wouldn't know nothing about that. Yeah. A tidy penny. Got anything stronger than this, deputy? No, we ain't. Oh. In Thornton, Mississippi, there's a joy juice still in every yard. All you need is corn, sugar, and a pot to boil it in. I was trying to fingerprint this old boy once. He had his hands in a mash barrel all his life. There was no skin at all on there. No prints. We ain't interested in your good old Mississippi boy stories. You ain't from here no more. Why'd you leave, anyway? Well, I just wanted a change of scenery. The grits started leaving a bad taste in my mouth. Well, if that's how you feel about it, Mr FBI Man... why don't you get back to your commie, nigger-loving bosses up North? You must not know my boss, Mr Hoover. He's not too fond of Commies. He'd be on your side. I don't give two shits whose side your Mr Hoover's on, boy. All I know is we got 5,000 niggers in this county who ain't registered to vote yet. And, as far as I'm concerned, they never will. So tell your stiff suits up in Washington, DC, they ain't gonna change us one bit. Unless it's over my dead body. Or a lot of dead niggers. You'd kill, Frank? Is that what you're saying? I wouldn't give it no more thought than wringing a cat's neck. And there ain't a court in Mississippi that'd convict me for it. How about you, Deputy? How are you with wringing necks, huh? Just keep pushing me, Hoover boy. You get this straight, you cornhole fucker. Tell your queer-ass bosses they'll never find them civil rightsters down here. So you might as well pack your bags and head up North where you belong. You get this straight, shitkicker. Don't you go mistaking me for some whole other body. Your brain's in your dick if you think we'll just fade away. We're gonna be here till this thing's finished. How about you, Deputy? Is that gun just for show? Or do you get to shoot people once in a while? Thanks for the beer. Ask them if they wanna help save this country from the onslaught of integration. You know the system: They want to throw white children and coloured children into the melting pot of integration out of which will come a conglomerated mulato, mongrel class of people. Both races will be destroyed in such a movement. I, for one, under God will die before I'll yield one inch to that kind of a movement in America. Do you know how much trouble you've caused. They've been on the radio all day, talking about FBI intimidation. We're not thugs, Mr Anderson. We'll do this my way. I know, bureau procedure. Why were you at the beauty parlour? If that was Bureau business, I wanna know about it. If not, I won't allow it. - Do you understand me? - Get in here. You know your problem? You don't know when to speak and when to shut up. That makes you a fool. Mrs Pell won't say anything her husband doesn't want her to. And I'm not gonna choke it out of her. This can of worms only opens from the inside. I know that. Freedom. Freedom.

Mrs Walker, I know this is difficult, but I need your help. If you could just persuade your son to press charges then we could pick up the deputy at least, right away. He won't talk to no one. And it won't do no good anyway. I promise it will. Leave him alone. Maybe then, they'll let us alone. If this is a pattern, I guess at least we know what happened on June 21st. Pell stopped the three boys for speeding at 3:00. He held them in jail until the Klan could get organised. He released them at 10:30. By that time, his buddies were ready and waiting. No. Pell went with 'em that night. I'm sure of it. Do you think he'll crack? Down here they say rattlesnakes don't commit suicide. Did you release the three civil rights workers... into the hands of the Klan on the night of June 21st? No. Are you a member of the Ku Klux Klan? No. - Have you ever been a member? - No. Are you familiar with the term Grand Cyclops? I've heard of it. Were you in fact the Grand Cyclops of the East Mississippi Klavern... of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan for the past three years? Objection. My client's already told you, he's not even a member of the Klan. Objection? This is just an interview, sir. There's really no need to be so formal. Well, if this is just an interview, I guess I don't have to stay here. I got work to do. I guess you do too, don't you? Yes, sir. You can be sure that we'll do it. Good luck. You all get enough to indict me, you know where to find me. - How'd it go? - Fine. Just fine. Don't you worry about a goddamn thing. Are you about to be indicted? Does the FBI have evidence against the sheriff's office? Are you cooperating with them? We're cooperating. We have all along. There's not one iota of proof. Could you not do that, please? Sir, do not do that, please. You've already been told once. Get the fuck outta here. Do we have to tell you 2,000 times? Go back where you belong. Get outta my face. Get on outta here and leave us alone. Leave us alone. Go on home where you belong, boy. You're gonna get hurt. Mr Ward, this is getting to be about as much as we can take. I cannot register a stronger complaint. Not now, sir. Now, just a minute. I resent your public pursuit of my sheriff's department. You have made every effort to implicate them in these disappearances. Your slimy innuendoes are not evidence that they were connected with any crime. We're trying to get to the truth. We're frustrated too. Any jackass can point a finger, but that ain't evidence. Us old cotton-choppers are still stupid enough to believe in democracy. We know our rights under the law. You know something, all right. I'd bet a cotton-chopping dollar on that. You're getting so far up my nose... I'm beginning to feel your boots on my chin. And I'm telling you one more time, Mr Apple Red. A couple of crazies in bedsheets dancing round the countryside scaring Negroes... is not the fault of the entire state of Mississippi. There are three dead kids and a lot of scared people because of your sheriff. So get used to having us around. Get used to my boots on your chin too. And you people better back off. Goddamn FBI. Who do they think they are, coming to my part of the country... Do you have a statement, Mr Mayor? Goddamn right I have. For a moment there, Mr Anderson... it sounded like we were both on the same side. - Are you all right, honey? - Yeah, I'm fine. Let me know if you need anything. Thanks. I will. Momma. Come quick. There's no sign of him, sir. He's long gone. His mother lives across the street. She won't even answer the door. I want the whole area covered. Someone must have seen something. - They won't talk to us. - Get going, Mr Bird. If they won't talk to us, shake it out of 'em. Let's go. Every house. Come on. What? All these white guys chasing around with their notebooks will get you nowhere. Ok. What would you do? It's ok to be afraid. Go on, Willie. Tell 'em what you saw. The defendants will rise. In this country a man's home is his castle. That is one of the principles by which this community survives. You men have done violence to that principle. But I want you to know that the court understands... that the crimes you have committed have been, to some extent at least... brought about by... outside influences. Outsiders have come into Jessup County... and they've been people of low morality... and unhygienic. And their presence here has provoked a lot of people. So the court understands... without condoning them, mind you... that the crimes to which you men have plead guilty... were, to some extent at least, provoked by these outside influences. So, with all this, I'm gonna make your punishment light. I'm gonna sentence you each to five years' imprisonment. But I'm gonna suspend these sentences. You can't go in there, sir. FBI. Let us through. I'm sorry, sir. You can't go in there. Sheriff? You all really started something this time. Move these cars. I wanna go in and talk to them. You've gone as far as you're gonna go. We can handle this. Just some crazy coloureds tearing up their own assholes. Local problem. Look at those flames, Mr Ward. That's why they sent you down here, wasn't it? It would've happened anyway and you know it. If I was a Negro, I'd probably think the same way they do. If you were a Negro, nobody'd give a damn what you thought. Aaron. Take your momma, grandmomma and the children out the back door. When you hit the road, keep going. You understand? Keep going, son. Nathan. Come on, Nathan. Get up. Get up, Nathan, now. Come on. Get out of the bed. - What's happening? - Momma. Come on, Momma. Come on, you all. Come on, Grandma. Let's go. ♪ All ye who labour ♪ Who's there? If you're in there, come on out. You hear? I ain't taking this shit no more. ♪ Bring him your burdens ♪ ♪ Seek not his favour ♪ ♪ Tell... tell him your sorrows ♪ ♪ In... him... confide ♪ ♪ He satisfies ♪ ♪ He satisfies ♪ Everything's ok, Papa. Momma and the girls are fine. They just cracked your head some. You just keep on breathing. Don't you go dying on me now. You hear me? You gonna be just fine. You know, cows won't run away. No one knows why. They're just stupid, I guess. They just stand there until their bellies swell up and they pop. They have relatives in Detroit. - Are they gonna go? - I didn't give 'em any choice. At least we know who did this. - We did. - Well, don't fret. It's progress. 20 years ago they'd have strung 'em up for stealing a watermelon. I don't understand you, Mr Anderson. Not at all. Let's get something straight, all right? This thing was fucked up the moment we turned it into a show for the newsmen. The moment those three kids disappeared, it was news. The moment the three civil rights workers disappeared, it was news. To me they're just kids. They're still missing. What's missing... is the 50 minutes Pell said he was with his wife. Ok. I love Mississippi. They... They hate Mississippi. They hate us because we present a shining example... of successful segregation. These Northern students, with their atheist, communist bosses... that have come into our community this summer with the wish to destroy it... this week have taken a terrible blow. This week their cause has been crippled. This week all of these federal policemen you see out here prying into our lives... violating our civil liberties... have learned that they are powerless against us... if every single Anglo-Saxon Christian one of us stands together. This week... - Ward? - We have company, sir. Why are you here? This is a political meeting. Doesn't smell that way to me, Deputy. It's a political meeting, Hoover boy. Oh, it looks like a political meeting but smells more like Klan to me... with or without the Halloween costumes. Gentlemen. In the courts of Mississippi, they have been reminded... that they cannot by force turn our communities... into replicas of their communities. Communities in which Negroes run riot, unrestrained and unpunished... as they do this summer in the streets of Harlem, or in the streets of Oakland... or in the streets of Chicago. Can I come in? It's not good for you to be here. - Why? - It's ugly. This whole thing is so ugly. Have you any idea what it's like to live with all this? People look at us... and only see bigots and racists. Hatred isn't something you're born with. It gets taught. At school they said segregation is what it said in the Bible. Genesis 9, verse 27. At seven years of age, you get told it enough times, you believe it. You believe the hatred. You live it. You breathe it. You marry it. My husband drove one of the cars that night. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? The bodies are buried on the Roberts farm, in an earthen dam. Sir. Take a break, Mr Bird. Put some handkerchiefs around your face. Bring that here. The bodies of the three civil rights workers were found today... at an undisclosed grave. Neither the FBI nor the sheriff's department will comment on the case. The bodies were brought to Jessup County Hospital. Officials here also refused comment. There is speculation that an autopsy will be performed later tonight. Ok, keep it open. We're coming through. Come on, open it up. Hold it back. Clinton, you got problems at home to tend to. What do you mean? I mean pull your head out of your ass and get home. "I, Vincent Thompson, am the cheddar-cheese champion of the worid." "In international competition with 42 other entries, my cheddar won first prize... based on flavour, texture, appearance and colour." Hey, Clinton. I didn't expect you home so early. Hi, Frank. No, don't. I'm sorry. Sir. Say again? I'll be right there. - Mr Bird. - Yes, sir? Get five men and meet me outside. - Where's Anderson? - He's at the motel, sir. You two take the front door. If anyone tries to get past you, break 'em down. You two take the door on the corridor. Mr Bird? Ok. Go get Anderson. Bring him here. Don't tell him why. Don't tell him anything. Just get him here. Mr Anderson. Stop. - Mr Anderson. - Go to hell. I'm telling you to stop and I mean it. We're not killers. It's the difference between them and us. No, between them and you. You're no more like them than I am. Wrong. What do you care what I do to a bastard hiding behind a sheriff's badge? You have the whole worid to change. And I'm changing it. You're as arrogant as you are stupid. You're changing it too. I'll make some changes right now. Don't mess this up just because you like fooling around with witnesses. A gun don't mean shit unless you use it. I'll kill you now if you don't listen to me. Fuck you. Let me go. Let me go. We'll go after all of 'em, together. You wouldn't know how. - You'll teach me. - You don't have the guts. Not only do I have the guts, I have the authority. What is that supposed to mean? New rules. We nail 'em any way we can. Even your way. Is this you talking or some guy pulling your strings? Both. - We do it my way. - Your way. - With my people. - Whatever it takes. Ok. Gimme a minute. - You think he would've shot me? - Oh, yes, sir. He's a ballsy little bastard, isn't he? They want me to say "Let us not forget... that two white boys also died helping Negroes help themselves." They want me to say "We mourn with the mothers of these two white boys." But the state of Mississippi won't even allow these white boys... to be buried in the same cemetery as this Negro boy. I say I have no more love to give. I have only anger in my heart today... and I want you to be angry with me. Now, I am sick and I am tired... and I want you to be sick and tired with me. I am sick and tired of going to the funerals... of black men who have been murdered by white men. I am sick and tired of the people of this country... who continue to allow these things to happen. What is an "inalienable right" if you are a Negro? What does it mean, "equal treatment under the law"? What does it mean, "liberty and justice for all"? Now I say to these people: Look at the face of this young man and you will see the face of a black man. But, if you look at the bloodshed, it is red. It is like yours. It is just like yours. You... I'm gonna tell you a story. A young kid named Homer Wilkes lives about 30 miles north of here. He'd just taken his girlfriend home and was walking back along the road... when a car pulled up. Three white boys took him for a ride. Now... he hadn't done anything... except... be a Negro. And they took him to a shack. A shack like... like this one. And they took out a razor blade... a regular old razor blade, like this one... and they pulled down his pants... and they spread his legs... and they sliced off his scrotum. Put it in a coffee cup. And do you know how much you bleed when somebody cuts off your balls? Huh? When they found Homer, he looked like he'd been dipped in blood up to his waist. He was barely alive when they got him to the hospital. He can hardly walk now. Mayor, we know you know... who was there when those three civil rights boys was murdered. We know you know who pulled the trigger. Is there something you wanna say to me? Ok. - Is he with the Bureau? - Yeah. He's kind of a specialist. You're sure the mayor won't talk? No, they'd kill him. All right. What do you have? There were three cars and seven men. Pell and Bailey did the killing. - Sheriff Stuckey? - He was too smart to be there. So Pell pulled the trigger for him. And Townley? It was his idea. Grand Dragons, they don't get their hands dirty. The whole thing, huh? Bullet by bullet. I don't suppose you're interested in words like "coerción" or "hearsay" or "duress". This is no good in court. We're not in court, Mr Ward. We'll never get 'em on murder anyway. That's a state charge. These hayseeds will never prosecute. I know that. We've got to get 'em in federal court. Violation of civil rights. Remember whose rights you're violating. Don't put me on your perch, Mr Ward. Don't drag me into your gutter. These people crawled out of a sewer, Mr Ward. And maybe the gutter's where we should be. Thank you. This better be important. Who the hell called this meeting? - We thought you did. - Of this group? Are you stupid? You didn't call this? Shit. If you didn't call this, who the fuck did? Shut up. Is this some kind of bullshit setup? Ray, are you sure you didn't call this? Cos I got a note from my wife and it said it was from you and Clinton. Lester, shut up. Now, we're all gonna walk straight outta here... and say nothing. That means nothing, Lester. First one who opens his mouth is dead. Shut up. Hey, Clinton. Clinton. Looks like the rattlesnakes are starting to commit suicide. Hi, Lester. We'll give you that ride home. What? Well, I know you said 4.30 but we're running a little late, so... - I'll meet you in the car. - You're cracked. Do you have change of a 20? Sure. Get in the car, Lester. Or you'll have a hard time picking your nose once I've closed this drawer. Lester, you could make it a lot easier on yourself by going on the record right now. I ain't got nothing to say. You barking up the wrong tree, mister. Lester, I gotta tell you something. We got you cold. Your buddies have already talked. You're lying. You're in a lot of trouble. We know you drove the second vehicle, the green truck. And your buddy says... Refresh my memory here, Mr Bird. "Lester Cowens kicked the Negro twice in the face and then shot him." That's a goddamn lie. No, it's true. What else, Mr Bird? "Lester Cowens said 'They only left me a nigger, but at least I shot me a nigger."' I didn't kill him. I shot him in the ass. We know that. He was already dead by the time you shot him. But your buddy sees it differently. Your buddy tells it that you killed the kid. You either go on the record right now... or it's gonna be your ass we're talking about, not just a black kid's. Think about it, Lester. Come on out of there. Come on out. This is tricky. They make it look so easy, don't they? I got a question for you, Clinton. You don't mind if I call you Clinton, do you? I feel like I know you so well. The way we have it, on the night of the murders... you made a short speech as the bulldozer buried the kids in the dam. How does Lester tell it? "Mississippi will be proud of you. You've struck a blow for the white man." Is that what you said, Clinton? Is that what you said? It must've been you... because Clayton Townley and Ray Stuckey were too smart to be there. And you was too stupid to think anybody'd remember what you said. But old Lester, he got a good memory. I'm sorry. I haven't done this for a long time. Did you make a speech the night that you beat up your wife, Clinton? Huh? Did ya? Did you strike a blow for the white man that night? You got a stupid smile. You know that, Pell? Can you see it? Huh? Good. Did you smile when the bulldozer ran over the black kid's body? Did ya? Did you smile when the bodies were covered over? Did ya? Get up here. Come on. Get up. Did you smile that same stupid smile, huh? Did ya? You... Did ya smile, Pell? Did ya smile? Huh? Did ya? Make no mistake about it, Deputy. I'll cut your fucking head off and not give a shit how it reads in the report sheet. One more bite. One more bite. One more bite, darling. One more bite. Shit, Lester. What the fuck is going on? Shut up. Get in the bedroom and lock the door. And stay away from the windows. Shit. Please. Please. I didn't say a thing. I swear. It's a setup. I didn't say nothing. I didn't say nothing. Nothing. I didn't say nothing. I didn't say nothing. I didn't say nothing. You're lucky we've been watching your ass, Lester. If you go on the record, Mr Cowens, we'll give you protection. If not... If not, they're gonna kill you anyway. Oh. You need a toilet, Lester. We really had him going, huh? We'll take care of the check, Mr Swilley. Well, I suppose I'll... be back for supper. Button up, Wesley. Why did he do it? He wasn't even in on it. Wasn't even Klan. Mr Bird, he was guilty. Anyone's guilty who watches this happen and pretends it isn't. No. He was guilty all right. Just as guilty as the fanatics who pulled the trigger. Maybe we all are. Hello. Yeah. I just missed you at the hospital. They said you'd gone home. What's left of it. - I'm real sorry. - So am I. - What are you gonna do? - I don't know. Where will you go? I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying. This is my home. Born here. Probably die here. If I wanted to leave, I would've done it a long time ago. Things'll work out. There's enough good people around here know what I did was right. And enough ladies like the way I fix their hair. Hey.
