- What can I get you? - Two whiskies. No, you don't get it. Two bottles of whiskey, J&B. Don't bother wrapping them, give them to me. Aged by ten years, it should be good. Shall we try some? Why not? Let her go! - Who the hell are they? - Damn it, I bet they're cops! Someone tipped them off, they were waiting for us. Shoot! He isn't giving up! Split up! Jump! Watch where you put your feet! They were waiting for us. The anti-racket squad. I heard you were looking for me. - Have you read the papers? - Yes. They talk about summary executions. They're saying it's our fault. Ours? The rackets have been terrorising the city for months. Anyone who doesn't pay is killed mercilessly. This time they were trapped. They could have surrendered. But instead, to get away, they didn't hesitate to kill innocents. One of the dead bandits participated in the post office robbery two years ago. Organized by Francesco Carnevale, Three employees were killed. Remember? Nobody's seen Carnevale since then. Our records indicate Carnevale was deported to France. No, he's here and he's working for the rackets, I'm sure of it. - You have to go. - But I haven't finished. It doesn't matter, finish it tomorrow. No, leave it. I'll take care of it. - I was expecting you later, Messina. - We need to discuss this now. Let's go next door. You can count me out if these are the conditions. What do you mean? I mean it's too risky now. Things used to run smoothly but since the anti-racket squad appeared... things have gotten complicated. You saw what happened at the bar yesterday. My men are risking their lives and they want to be paid better. You might even be right, Messina, but there's nothing I can do. I don't make the decisions. For now, take this money. I'll pass your message on... and you'll see, everything will be resolved. By the way, Antonio Rotuno and Luca Coppola haven't come back to pay. They're trying to be smart. First I want to come to an agreement, then I'll deal with them, Hi, Romoletto. Why the visit? I've been straight for months. Don't worry, just a little chat, as good friends. Listen, can you tell me anything about these three? Take a good look at them. They're the ones you got in the bar. I saw them in the newspapers. I'd never seen them before. You're really sure you've never seen those three before? - I swear on my grave. - If you swear then I believe you. But you know one of those three dead bandits... he was high as a kite on drugs. You need to get to work. With all the queers, all the sons of bitches. With all the whores hovering around you that you deal to. - Me? - Come on. Look, just ask around for me. We're good friends, right? What have you found? Looks like drugs to me. - And you? - I don't know anything. I bought that sideboard two days ago, I swear. No, don't swear. Luckily it was me who found it. Just imagine if any of my colleagues had found it? With your history you'd be looking at ten years. Thank you, but I swear... Do you really think I found the drugs by chance? It was a tip off from someone who really likes you, a friend of yours. God damned son of a bitch, who is it? It isn't quite as easy as that. I've shown you I'm a friend, now you show me as well. It's been a while. What's wrong with you? Has your cat died? Allow me to introduce Marshal Baragli. - Marshal Baragli is with the police. - Yes, I'm with the police. Do you believe in the cards? Yes, the cards. They told me it would happen today. - What would happen? - It's a question of predestination. I getit. But what does it mean? - Wait here for a minute. - You're leaving me all alone? Don't worry, I'll say hello to my friends then I'm coming back. Are you looking for me? I haven't done anything. I always come here with my kids after work, I love ice-skating. - We need some information. - From me? Who did they hang around with? These photos were in the papers, they're the ones from the bar. I've no idea who they are, I don't remember them. Luca! Can't you see I'm falling over with out you? I'll be right there, Antonella. I have to go, I'm in the middle of an ice-skating lesson. Try to remember something, or we'll teach you a lesson. - Marshal Baragli. - Yes? That son of a bitch got me again. I'L kill him if I find him. - Why don't you get to him first. - What do you mean? You lift the receiver and do the raspberry first. That's a good idea. You're showing promise. And I always keep my promises. Like the cards. One out of four. Either you're out of practice or you're going blind. It's you bringing me bad luck, I can still see perfectly. In that case. You can still see these perfectly. Don't you recognise them? You must have seen them. There's a nice reward if you can tell me something. You'll pay for my funeral? I don't know anything about them. - Have you got a light? - There are some matches on the chair. You smoke too much. And now cop, you're finished! - God you're fast. - You don't play around with those. You stick to playing cards, and give that back to me. - Where did you get the other gun? - From here, see? I've got an ankle holster. Listen, how long have you been taking drugs? What are you thinking? Why would you say something like that? It doesn't take much to figure it out. Besides, what did you want from Romoletto? Drugs, perhaps? 1 got you! I'm sorry, sir, 1 didn't realise it was you. There's this son of a... Sorry, go ahead. I'm on my way. - What happened? - Someone robbed a jewellers. They killed a customer, "And so it was that men could, for the first time... ™ "see the other side of the moon.” Daddy, why can't you see the other side of the moon? Don't you know? I'l) explain it to you. So, this is the Moon, and this is Earth. When the Moon... When the Earth... It's the Moon that spins. Why don't you know these things? I'll tell you later. Where? When? Actually, I still haven't eaten, and I promised Alberto... Okay, I'll be right there. - Listen, I have to... - 1 know, you have to go out. Don't worry about me, I'll wait downstairs with the porter. They always watch TV till late. The eggs are burnt, shall I make them again? No, I'll do it, then they won't get burnt. I'll see you later. This is the shell we found. - And it was here on the floor? - Yes, where it's marked. - It's the only one you found? - Yes, the only one. A 7-65. The ambulance has arrived to take you to hospital. I don't want to go to the hospital, I want to go home. - He doesn't want to go. - You have to, you're still in shock. - I need to close the shop. - Don't worry, we'll do that. You're not well. Good evening, Commissioner. Hello, Baragli. I don't think this has anything to do with the racket. From what I could figure out they weren't professionals. There were three of them, probably amateurs... and they killed the guy in fright. Let's try to establish where the shot came from. The customer was near the counter. That's where they found the shell. He was obviously shot from very close range. Listen, Bruno just called from headquarters. Romoletto's looking for you, he wants to speak to you immediately. You stay here, I'll take the car. Get a ride back to headquarters with one of them. I'll see you later. The autopsy will help us establish the trajectory of the bullet. I've got something on the robbery at the jewellers where the guy got killed. - To show you I'm a friend. - Okay, I get it. Go to Mima's place and bring your soldiers. You'll find something good. But the robbery happened two hours ago. How did you find out so soon? Who's your informant? And who's so interested in handing over those robbers to us? I'm telling you how things stand, but keep me out of this. It's enough that I'm telling you, and I hope it's enough... if you're a friend. Okay. Let's say it's enough. What do you want? Let him go, he hasn't done anything! We haven't done anything, we're innocent! - It's all over, thanks Marshal. - Don't thank me, we got a tip-off. They handed them to us. The racket doesn't want intruders. Your insistence on seeing me worries me a great deal. You know very well we should never meet, never! Yes, sure. I know. You're right, but what I have to tell you is very important. For me at least. Go ahead, I'm listening. The fact is, since the anti-racket gang appeared... the risks are getting much higher, and you know that. Some of my men have already lost their lives, just like at the bar. We're not risking our lives for a small piece of the pie anymore. From now on we want half. - Half? - Sure, half. It's never too much when you're risking your life, you have to understand that. I have to answer to my men. You're safe, nobody bothers you. Nobody knows you, Turn around. Well? I'll think about it. Eat up, it's all genuine stuff. Our customers always come back. Good evening, and hello everybody. Hello, grandpa! Can I buy you a drink? - No thanks, I just finished one. - You're offending me. You can't refuse Antonio Rotuno the pleasure of offering you a drink. Half a litre for grandpa, I'm paying. Look, grandpa's had enough. No, take this. Want a smoke? Take a few more. Antonio, let's go outside. We need to talk. Give me the bill. You haven't finished. Don't you like it? I can make you something else if you didn't like it. No, we have to go. How much? It's 4000 Lira, okay? Keep the change. Let's go. Listen, prepare a plate of spaghetti, garlic, oil, and chilli. Lots of chilli. I'm going outside with my friends for a moment and I'll be right back. Okay, lots of chilli, just how you like it. Let's hope he comes back soon or it will get cold and it won't be nice anymore. Goodnight everyone. What happened to you? Get up, kid. He's dead! They killed him! They killed that kid! They killed him, hurry! You really won't talk? What can I say? I don't know anything, I didn't see anything. All I know is they killed a dog that was worth a fortune, that's all. And they'll kill all of them if you can't pay. Tell us who comes to collect the protection money. Christ, you're all too scared to talk. You've finally arrived. You took your time. You know, the dog track's 20km from here. We did it in only 15 minutes. What more do you want? Maybe it's because I'm hungry but it feels like I've been waiting two hours. I could do with a nice steak. I haven't eaten in two days. No, look, I'm not coming. It's too late, my boy's home alone. You can't go on living alone with your son. Have you ever thought of marrying again? Like it's easy to find a beautiful woman, young... willing to marry a cop, with a ten year old boy. Goodbye, Fulco. “I repeat, 14, Via Adelaide. Request immediate assistance, over. ” I don't know anything, I don't know anyone, I didn't see anything. Like a broken record, but they know. And they're letting themselves get screwed. Why are we wasting our time over this? That's what I say. It's pointless. Why don't you ask for an extra officer to do this routine work? That's enough. I'm the first to be upset. We've got to keep going, even if it feels pointless. We'll find someone eventually who's had enough and wants to talk. It's a good thing I'm going to the firing range tomorrow. Here we go again, when you don't like the job you have target practice. It's the qualifiers for the Olympics. Come on, everyone knows you're the best marksman on the force. - Let's hope he wins a medal. - Why not? You were real close in the last Olympics. "From the documents recovered from the body it seems he's Antonio Rotuno... ” "Born in Ciaculli, April 5, 1942. " Wasn't that guy who got shot in the bar born in Ciaculli? Sure, Pasquale Morgante, born in Ciaculli. I don't remember the date but he was born in Ciaculli. This is Marshal Baragli. Calling squad car 21. Do you hear me? "Sure we do. Squad car 21, over. ” I heard they killed Antonio Rotuno. Tell me everything you know. "About an hour ago a patrol car was dispatched to 11, Via Soldati... “where they found the body of a man identified as Antonio Rotuno... ” “born in Ciaculliin 42". * "The body was disfigured, probably by the two men he was last seen with. " Let's get over there. I was on my bike when I saw this thing on the ground. It looked like a sack to me. 1 got off, I had a look, and I saw it was that poor kid. - Did you see where those men went? - No, there was nobody around. Are you going to sit down and eat properly? We can't afford to sit down, we're cops. - Some wine? - No, water. Teetotal as well. Want a sandwich? No, thanks. You said he was a good Kid, so you knew Antonio Rotuno well. I saw him eat here sometimes. Come here, you. What are you doing here? I just came here to eat something and see if a friend was here. - But he's not here, so... - A friend. Would that friend happen to be Antonio Rotuno? - I don't know any Antonio Rotuno. - No? Let's see if you know him, I'm going for a walk with my friend. He's been dead at least two hours. What a way to go. They beat him to death. Now you're going to tell me everything you know. They'll kill me. Like they killed Antonio. You don't get it, if you don't talk I'll kill you! - Please, have a seat. - Thanks. - What can I do for you? - I need to transport a coffin. Whatever you need. - Where do we collect the body? - The morgue. I understand, an accident. - Where do we have to take the body? - To Ciaculli, in Sicily. What was the deceased's name? Antonio Rotuno. Are you related? - A friend? - No, neither. Who ordered the transport? The police. I almost forgot, send the bill to the anti-racket squad. Well? Now he doesn't know what to think. All we have to do is wait. He's making a call. Can you hear me? Go ahead, Bruno. I'm listening. He's making a call. Stay on the line. We're in trouble. A cop came to see me. I'm certain I'm a suspect. I'll wait for your orders. He fell for it. Quick, trace the call. Okay, chief. Just as you predicted. He called this number; 627-8476. This is the number he called; 627-8476. - Yes, that's it. - We're heading to the area. In the meantime get the exact address from headquarters. See if they've got the address. - Bruno, Toto, can you hear me? - Yes, Fulco, clearly. Finally, we couldn't hear you before. Have you got the address? Via Clatani, 22. Building 14. The phone number's registered to a Michele Lacaptrio. Okay, we're heading over there. Keep your eyes open. Doorman. - What do we do? -Goin. "We're in trouble. A cop came to see me. ” “I'm certain I'm a suspect. ” “I'll wait for your orders. " But that's the message from the funeral director. They maintain contact through this device. Now we have to wait, to find out who the message was for. They're still there. Apartment 14, third floor. Come out with your hands up. Don't do anything stupid. - Who called you? - Drop it or I'll blow your brains out. What's going on? What the hell are you doing? I said drop the gun. - 1 think you've got it wrong. - Like hell! - We got you, didn't we? - You know who we are? Sure I do. Two dirty thieves. - Besides, I recognise your face. - I'm sure you do. I'm Marshal Baragli from the anti-racket squad, you idiot! It's true. Sorry, Marshal. Quiet. "We're in trouble. A cop came to see me. ” “I'm certain I'm a suspect. ” “I'll wait for your orders. " Don't move. Don't do anything. I'll take care of everything. "Don't move. Don't do anything. "'ll take care of everything. " We've finally got something. It's about time. We've got the voice of the boss of the rackets. - Now we need to put a face to it. - Easier said than done. It's a perfect system, he can give orders without ever being seen... and he didn't leave any trace behind him. You're wrong about that. He left a trace and it's recorded here. - Hear that noise in the background? -Yes, I heard it... but I can't figure out what it is. Now we'll try to isolate it and amplify it... but it will take time, we've got a lot of work and it's all urgent. Do me a favour, guys, I have to know where that call came from. Okay, it means we'll have to skip lunch as well. Thanks. You know, I'm really on form, I didn't miss a shot yesterday. Bruno, you're always going on about your target practice. I think you're sick. It's hot in here, it's too much. Aren't you hungry? I'm starving. God damn it! I never thought of that. And you? We didn't take our eyes off the agency for a second. We watched the woman go in, and when she screamed we realised immediately. By the way, you were right. - About what? - About Carnevale. He wasn't deported to France, he was here. - Where is he now? - The morgue. He was killed two hours ago. Seems his name is Mario Messina. They shot him from a Rolls Royce which quickly fled the scene. Some kid saw everything. These two murders must be linked. A Rolls Royce. Do the papers know? No, we haven't informed them, and the witness is safe. The boss of the racket is wiping out anyone connected to him. Eliminating anyone who could lead us to him. What are you doing here? Given that you disappeared it was the only way to find you, I'm usually the one doing the hunting... but this time I don't mind being the prey. You're a liar. I know why you went with me, You thought I was mixed up in some shady deal... and I could give you information... but when you realised I wasn't involved you disappeared. No, I'd really liked to have seen you, I just didn't have the time. But we can make up for that very soon. This is my phone number in case you've forgotten it. No, I haven't forgotten. - Then you thought of me. - Of course. Okay, I'll just go on waiting. Goodbye, cop. - Forensics have got something. - Finally. - Didnt they tell you what? - No, they didn't tell me anything. - They could have told you. - We'll find out now. Listen. Let me hear that again. What could it be? We've given it a lot of thought but we haven't managed to identify it. There might be a way. Sit them down. The seats are here. Slowly. Thank you for coming. You already know what this is about. We're going to play you a recording... and I hope one of you can work out what the sound is. Go ahead. Unfortunately it's all we've got. We'll play it again. I think I know what it is. - Can I hear it again? - Of course. Rewind it. - It's a tennis court. - He's right, it's a tennis court. Right! Listen, I'm looking for a guy who comes here. His name's Fulco Lastrucci, he drives a grey Rolls Royce... 1 didn't see his car outside. You know if he's coming today? I've never heard that name before, and nobody here has a Rolls Royce. Perhaps you've got the wrong club. There's another one down the road. I'll try there then. There's no-one here. No, nobody has a Rolls. Okay, that's enough for now. But the lesson isn't over. You look tired, we should stop. We'll continue in the afternoon. You're always surrounded by bodyguards. - The streets are full of criminals. - I can protect myself. I can't, so I prefer to pay them. I'll be right with you. What is it, Maurice? A friend of mine called me. He told me the police are watching all the tennis clubs. They're looking for the Rolls. Romoletto. I'm inside, come in. Go get some petrol. What's going on? I did what you wanted. You've got him now, so you've got to let me go! Stop fucking around! Son of a bitch, tell me who sent you, and where I can find him? I don't know anything. Nobody sent me, I don't know anyone. If you really don't know then you're screwed... because I'm not stopping it until you talk! What are you doing up at this hour? You promised you'd stay, that we could decorate the Christmas tree. Sure we will. You'll see, I'll be back soon. You'd better meaniit. I'll be waiting. Yes, go to bed. Go to sleep. Go straight back to bed. Damn it. It's a trap, let's go! Don't stop! Let's get out of here. - Where did they go? - That way. I've got the entire school hostage... and I'll kill all the children if you don't do what I want! I want to go to an airport, and I want a plane waiting for me. I'll take two kids with me... and I'll only let them go when I'm somewhere safe. - You have an hour. - Don't do anything foolish! Surrender! Where will you go? That's my business. Stop wasting time. When the hour is up I'll kill a kid, and I'll kill another one every hour. Hurry up! Do what I said. -We're in a real mess. - We'll make it. They have to do it. The kids are our salvation. She isn't well, get me a chair. I'm thirsty. - Sabrina, get some water. - No, everyone stays here! - But she isn't well. - Enough. Surround the building, but don't get too close. All the important ones are here. What's the situation exactly? They'll soon realise they don't have a choice. The situation really is desperate. We'll have to accept his terms if we want to save the children. - He's the owner. - I want to know what it's like inside. Get those people back. I want my mummy. Shut him up! Please, let the children go. - Keep me. - Quiet, or I'll shut you up myself. Excellency, we've also got to think of the hostages he wants to take with him. Besides, we don't have anymore time, we've got to make a decision. - Do as I said. - Okay, that's what I'll do. We have to accept their demands. - There's something we can try. - What? You see that chimney? It's connected to the classroom. We could climb on the roof and try and gas them to sleep. They won't even notice. What do you say? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? I'm listening. We accept your demands but we'll need another hour. It should all be ready now. It was impossible, we can't do it unless you give us at least an hour, We're only talking about an hour. Okay. Be careful, this had better go smoothly or you'll regret it. - What happened? - Bandits have kidnapped the children. Michele! Get back. You want to talk to your mother? Come here. Did you bring everything? It's all there. You know, Fulco is dead. Come on, we've got work to do. She's fainted. Please, get some water, There's water in the bathroom, they can bring it out front. You go. You've made a big mistake. You tried to trick me. You didn't take me seriously, you'll regret it. 1 told you I'd kill a hostage every hour. Now I'm going to kill one every fifteen minutes! And you asked for it! That poor teacher's death is on our conscience. And from now on nobody's going to try anything. Get a car here. We're bringing the car over. We'll leave the door open and the engine running, as you asked. And now that son of a bitch is going to leave with our blessing. Do you feel like taking a shot when he comes out? He has to show himself. Yes, I know, it won't be an easy target. But they told us not to try anything. Ill assume all responsibility. Do you feel up to it? Sure I feel up to it. - You only get one shot. -Yes, I know. Show yourself, you son of a bitch. I only need a two centimetre gap. Good. There he is, he's the boy in the yellow shirt. - Are you Fulco's boy? - Yes, daddy still isn't back. He told me he'd be back early to decorate the Christmas tree. - Are you a cop like him as well? - Yes. I'm a cop like him as well. Subtitled by Bugsy Siegel. December 2014
