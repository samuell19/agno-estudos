[upbeat 80s music] - [Danny] It's funny how all this happened to me and not to Jeff. I've always had a hard time talking to girls, but Jeff. - Hey, wait a minute. Where you going? Hey, what's wrong? - [Danny] Jeff is obsessed with girls. That's all he ever thinks about. [muffled chatter] He must have an unusually high level of hormones, but I don't know. He's been like this since the 4th grade. - Hey, when was the last time you went out with a girl? - Not for awhile. - Yeah, quite a while. That's why I'm in between girlfriends. Everybody has dry spells. - You know, I think this could be serious. We could be running outta girls. You know, there might not be enough girls to go around. - Thanks to the notes, Jeff. - Yeah, no problem. Hey, hey, hey. You've got to try harder, especially you. - Me? - Yeah. Now look, it's real simple. Just watch this, all right? Hold on. Hi. Hey, wait a sec. Where are you going? Hey, what's wrong? - [Danny] Jeff figures that if he talks to a hundred girls, he's bound to get lucky sooner or later. He can walk up to a total stranger and say, "Hi." I can't. For me, it just has to happen. [upbeat music] [girls laugh] - I don't see what the big deal is about getting a guy interested. I mean, I could get any guy to go out with me. - [Girl On Left] Oh, sure. Right. - You wanna bet? - Yeah. Any guy? ♪ I walked into - How about. ♪ Not thinking a thing, minding my business ♪ That guy.

What do I do with this? - Anything you want. [Danny chuckles] [heels clack] [up-tempo dance music] - Then she took me to one of those places where everybody wears leather jackets and subway jewelry. I guess they thought I looked pretty strange. It's a crazy place. - What? - Nothing. [women laugh] Wanna dance? I mean, after you finish your drink and unless you to want to. You rather finish your drink first, that's fine. Either way. - No. - Okay, neither do I. - You're a nice guy. - Thanks. - No, I mean it. You're really not too bad a guy. That's why I don't think that I should see you anymore. [Danny laughs] It's bad for my image. - What? - It's bad for my image. - What's that supposed to mean? [laughs] What's this? Do you know those people? - Look, I asked you out on a bet. Those are my friends, and they put me up to it. [women laugh] So I won the bet. I think it's only fair that we split the winnings. - This is what you won? A t-shirt? - Yeah. - How do you split a t-shirt? - Well, simple. I wear it for month and you wear it for a month. - It's okay, you keep it. It'll look better on you anyway. Didn't turn out way I expected, but that's okay. Probably never see her again. Anyway, why should it bother me? There's lots of girls out there. Aren't there? Hope there are. There better be. [door creaks open] [door shuts] Oh well. I'm always too busy working or going to school to meet anybody really interesting. [fridge clangs] Must be somebody out there. [heels clack] - Use a glass, please. - Hi, Mom. Going out? - Yes, and I'm late already. What are you doing tonight? - Working. - Lester's in the living room. Say something nice, would you? - [groans] Mom. - Come on. [paper rustles] [Lester clears throat] - Hey, Lester. How's it going? - Well, unemployment is still going up. On the other hand, interest rates are coming down. - Great. - However, the rate of inflation seems to remain the same. - Ready? - Yes. Well, good seeing you again, Daniel. - Dan. [laughs] Bye honey. - Goodbye. Have a good time. Lester's okay. No prize, but he's basically harmless. Believe me, I've seen worse, a lot worse, right here where I work. [Bruno hums] [Italian music] No, no, not this guy. That's Bruno, my boss. He's okay. - Either way, do you own a ring? - This guy, Ralph. - Rent. - [Danny] What an operator. He brings a different girl in here every night. - Ah, my favorite sound. I love this sound. They say if champagne bubbles could speak, they wouldn't be talking at all but singing love songs, [speaks in foreign language], in French. - Oh. - Excuse me, sir. That isn't champagne. That's sparkling wine from California. - Champagne is sparkling wine, Mr. Gourmet. Get outta here. - Sorry. - [Woman] Wouldn't an American champagne speak in English? - Yeah, sure. Either way, what is that perfume you're wearing? It's absolutely delightful. - Do you really like it? - Get outta here! If you want, I'll rattle your cage. - Sorry. Sorry. - Go on, beat it. Sorry. - Oh, hey, not you, darling. Sit there. - [chuckles] Okay. [glasses clink] [drink splatters] - Oh! - Oh God, honey. I'm sorry. - Oh, I'm so embarrassed. - No, it's not a problem. Look, you got a little something on your - Oh, oh! - watchamacallits. - No, really. It's. [laughs] - [Danny] My theory is that Ralph was hatched under a pile of rocks outside of Las Vegas nightclub, providing the original inspiration for the term lounge lizard. - Suck my tongue.

[laughs] Do you play? - Nope. - Would you like to try? - Sure. - Okay. Take your right hand. Left hand, between your fingers. No, like that. Nice and loose. Now grind the ball. - Maybe I should take off my coat. - No. [cue clatters] [alarm blares] - What's that? - That's Sinus. We just got a new burglar alarm, and he's probably playing with it. [box shuffles] - At least we know it works. [upbeat music] Okay, so it wasn't Marcy's fault that Sinus wanted to try out the new burglar alarm in the middle of the night. That didn't bother me. But when he tried to play pool with us, that bothered me. Goodnight. I guess next time we'll have to bring a date for Sinus. [muffled chatter] - Hey. What happened? You look terrible. - It's a long story. - Of course, always looked terrible, so. - Who's she? - Her? - Yeah. I dunno. Must be a transfer student or something. - Hmm. Interesting. - Get your books. - Danny, did you hear what I just said? - What? - My parents are yanking me outta school, sending me to some boarding school in Switzerland next week. I mean, Switzerland. You ever hear of anything exciting happen in Switzerland? - Well, sure. They had a big avalanche last week. - I feel really terrible about all this. - Oh no. Don't worry about it. The ski patrol found everybody. It wasn't that bad. - No, you know. I mean, we just met and now I have to leave. - Well, I'll just see you when you get back. - You will? - Sure. - Wonder what language they speak over there. - Swiss. - That's a cheese Danny, not a language. - Well maybe they speak the international language. - [laughs] Danny, you're embarrassing me, but please continue. - Later.

[upbeat rock music] Okay, I tried my best line on Esme. It didn't work. What's my next move? - You see, Dan, girls mature faster than boys. So girls our age are attracted to older guys.

She probably only dates married men. - Come on. - She'd be embarrassed to walk in a place like this, let alone be seen with us. ♪ You're leaving me too [door creaks open and shut] - She must be lost.

I'm her brother. - [Pop] I don't care who you or who you think you are. Don't talk to her like that. - Yeah, well you just said it. You don't care.

[bags rustle] [door opens and shuts] [bright cheery music] - I just can't figure out how all this happened. - [scoffs] Of course you can't. [sighs] You're too close to it. Now me, I got a better perspective on the whole thing. I saw it all happen. It's simple, Dan. You can get any woman you want to. - Nah, it's just luck, that's all. - [scoffs] One girl is luck, but three, let's face it. There's something about you that makes you extremely attractive to women. - Okay, but why didn't it work for me before? - [laughs] Because before you didn't know you had it, so you didn't use it. Now that you've got it, you can use it anytime you want to. - I don't wanna get involved with any more women. My life is complicated enough. - Well, that's a big mistake. Now that you got it, you gotta use it all the time, or else it'll dry up. Sex appeal's like a muscle. Gotta exercise it to keep it in shape. You know what I mean? - Hi, Danny. - Oh, hi. How you doing? - Pretty good. Bye bye. - Bye bye. - See what I mean? You got it. - You really think so? - [sighs] Take your pick, Dan. You got what they want. - It's kind of scary. [Jeff chuckles] [sultry soft Middle Eastern music] - We're ready. - Close your eyes. - Okay, open. - [Danny] I don't believe this! - Isn't it wild? - I had a nightmare about going to Arabia. I came up with this. - This is... [laughs] I feel like there should be dancing girls feeding you meet grapes. [girls clap] - Come. The night is young. - Yes, come. - [grunts] Thank you. Listen, I love you all, [girls laugh] but I have to go to work. - No! - No. Come on, stay. - No, really, I do. - Danny. - Look, I'm working a late shift. I gotta go. I'm sorry. - Oh, come on. - Please, Danny. - Nobody move. I'll be back in about four hours. [slow humorous music] [girls laugh] - Come back! [laughs] - Come back! [laughs] - That did it for Jeff. He was convinced it was all an elaborate plan to drive him crazy, but he's wrong. It's an elaborate plan to drive me crazy, and it's working real well. [Bruno hums] Bruno? - Huh? - Can I talk to you for a minute? - Yeah. Make it quick. - Well, it's kinda personal. - About a girl? - Yeah. Well, not just one girl. - Wait, I got it. You like two girls, but you don't know which one to ask out. - Sort of. Bruno, now just suppose you were sleeping with three girls in the same bed, and you really liked one of them and you were close friends with the other two, but you didn't wanna kick them out. You know, what would you do? - How often do you have this dream? - Oh, it isn't a dream. - I think what you should do is find yourself a nice girl and go after her. There's nothing wrong with a healthy sex drive. It's good for ya. - Really? - As a matter of fact, you should have a lot of girlfriends. - Thanks a lot, Bruno. - My pleasure.

Chicken isn't bad, but first thing we wanna do is wipe off all the silverware. - What? - Why? - You know how at some restaurants people bring their own wine? Well, here, you wanna bring your own silverware. [Italian music] [silverware clatters] [girls laugh] The rolls aren't bad, though. [roll crunches] [Terry laughs] Usually. Huh. - [clears throat] Excuse me, sir. Compliments of the house. - You're kidding. - Well, this is what you usually order, isn't it, sir? - Oh yeah, yeah. Hmm. Good year. - Don't drink it too fast. - Fantastic. Well, Bruno, you outdid yourself. - Oh, thank you. - Thanks a lot. - Just don't be late for work tomorrow. [Danny laughs] Thanks a lot, really. Thanks. I'd like to make a toast. - Okay. - To all of us, the best of friends. [glasses clink] - Hey Bruno, come here. - Yeah, what do you want? - What's with the kid over there? Looks like he's got more than he can handle, huh? [laughs] - You see the good looking one? That's what's- - Wait, wait, wait, wait. I don't know which one you're talking about. They're all good looking. - Oh, okay. See the one with the long dark hair and a kind of fiery smolder? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see her. I see her. - That's his girlfriend. The other two are his roommates. - Roommates? - Right. - You mean this kid is living with three girls? - Yeah. - Well, isn't that something? [groans] Hey, but what am I telling you for? You know what that's like. - It's not all that great. After awhile, they take over your whole life. - Mm-hmm. [girls laugh] So what about that other party you were expecting? - Eh, she's not gonna show. [girls laugh] [coin clinks] For the trust fund, eh? [girls laugh] Hey, hey, hey. [lips smack] Hey. [laughs] Baby. Ciao, doll. - One mint! [mint clatters] [coin clinks] [soft music] - [Terry] So why was everyone looking at us? - I think they were looking at Danny's tie. - What's wrong with my tie? - I think it was his coat. - [laughs] What? - Maybe it's the coat and the tie. - What? [girls laugh] What's wrong with this? - This is a snappy combination you got going on. - This is a versatile, coordinated look. I can wear this to the office, to business meetings, or to informal social gathering such as this. - Can we do this again sometime? - [Danny] Don't tell me you're still hungry. - Well, maybe a little. [Danny laughs] [elbow thuds] [Terry laughs] [doors shut] [upbeat music] [trunk clicks open] [trunk shuts] [muffled speaking] - Bye bye. [lips kiss] [door shuts] - Danny! What is going on here? - Hi, Mom. You're back early. - Who are these girls? - If you just settle down, I'll explain everything. - And what have you done to your room? It looks like a bordello! - You see, Mom, we're kind of having a sort of a slumber party. - I can see that. [doorbell rings] - I'll get it. - No! I'll get it. It's probably the police. - That must be Zero. [door shuts] - Hey people, all we gotta do is get rid of the old lady, and we can do some serious partying around here. - Zero, you're back. - Mom, this is Zero, another friend of mine. - Danny, this is too much. I am not running a co-ed boarding house! - Oh, you don't understand, Mrs. Burnett. I don't stay here all the time. - Can we settle this in the morning? - All right. Girls, sleep here. Boys, sleep in the living room. I sleep in the middle. - Oh, Mom. - Danny, I have just come from a long trip, and I don't wanna hear any more about it. - Can I get my pillow? I can't sleep about it. Okay. - [sighs] Ah, Mom. [soft music] - [Zero] So what do you wanna do? - I wanna go get something to eat. - I don't mean now. You know, you can't stay at Danny's forever. - I know. - What about your parents? - They don't want me. - Sure they do. - No, they don't. - Maybe I should have a talk with 'em. - No, I don't think so. - Well, why don't you come with me? - You mean to Detroit? - No, to Bolivia. Of course Detroit. - It's so far away. - We'll be driving, not walking. - You'll be doing all the driving? - Yeah. - No, thanks. I think I'd rather walk. [laughs] [seats groan] [upbeat music] - Bruno? Bruno. See you later. - Good night, Danny. [Bruno chuckles] [coffee splutters] [door opens] - Hi, Danny. - What's up, Dan. - Hi. - Hi. - Busy night? - Yeah. - All right, [muffled speaking]. [muffled chatter] - You wanna play? - Yeah. - See, I didn't grow up with any brothers or sisters, so to me, this is like having a big family. It's kind of nice. - Delightful. - Let's face it. This place is just too small for all of us. Another bathroom would be helpful. - You know what? You should all head up to my place. It's got five bathrooms and a swimming pool. No one's there except Sinus. You see, my parents are in Brazil again. I think my mom's getting a tummy tuck. - Why doesn't she just wear a girdle? - [Marcy] The beach. - Who goes to the beach? - What do you say, guys? You're all invited. - I don't know. It's so far from everything, isn't it? - I thought you were the one that wanna get out of here. - I feel so bad about leaving Mrs. Burnett all alone. - Oh, don't be silly. I'll be fine, just fine, really. - Well, let's go this weekend. - Can I help up anyone pack? [upbeat music] - Come on, Z. You're gonna melt in those clothes. Hey, come on. Wanna go swimming? - You like him, don't you? - In a funny kind of way. - It's boiling out here. Why don't you go swim? - Yeah. - Why do you make it so hard on him? - What am I supposed to do, run over and jump on him? - That's one way to do it. - There's lots of things you can do. - All right. You've thought about it. We've talked about it. Now it's time to make your move. - What would you do? - With Marcy, it's gotta be something special. - [laughs] Yeah. Big. - Really big. Got a few ideas. First, I wanna know something. How far are you willing to go with this? - All the way. - Good man. [loppers snap] [loppers snap] [phone rings] [waves crash] - Hello? Yeah, sure. It's for you. - For me? Hello? - I'm gonna change. - No, just wait. [soft music] [bird caws] - Bye. It's parents. They want me back. Zero, guess what? - Terry! [water splashes] [boys laugh] [water drips] - Sorry. [boys laugh] [objects clatter] [Zero laughs] I'm sorry. - It's all right. - Need a towel, buddy? Jeff was smitten by Marcy, and it wasn't just the bikini. Zero's plan was wild, crazy, and farfetched. In other words, it was perfect for Jeff. [feet thump] [traffic roars in background] Here you go. - Are you guys sure this is gonna work? - Should work. - Should work? I'll be seeing you guys later. - Hey, come on, come on, - Hey, hey, hey. come on, come on. There's nothing to it. - Just don't look down. - Give me that. I'll show you. [paint can thuds] - [Danny] Careful, Z. - Hey, I do this stuff fall the time, all right? [paint can thuds] - Hey, man. Would you watch what you're doing? - Impressive demonstration, Z. - It's not just the technique. It's the style. - Hey, I've got the wrong shoes on, all right? You try, you think you so hot. - This I gotta see. [upbeat music] [Jeff sighs] - Women. I wonder if guys in other solar systems have the same problems as we do. [star whooshes] - We'll be right here if anything happens! Okay? Jeff? [birds chirp] [girls laugh] [body tumbles over car] - Aren't you guys coming? - No, you guys go ahead. - Come on, Terry. - Yeah, let's go, man. [doors shut] [engine starts] [tires peel out] [tires screech] [horn honks] [upbeat music] - [Terry] Marcy, isn't that your limo? - [Marcy] What limo? Where? - [Terry] That black limo that just drove by. Isn't that yours? - Oh no. It's my mother. What's she doing here? She's supposed to be in Brazil. [door shuts] [both laugh] [footsteps shuffle] [engine hums] - [Danny] Alone at last. First, a little mood music.

[laughs] - [Danny] It's funny how things work out. Nobody thought Jeff and Marcy would ever hit it off. Now they're inseparable, sorta like Esme and I or Terry and Zero. [everyone laughs] Take us to the harem, Z. Forward! [horns honk] The harem room didn't stay up too much longer. We really didn't need it anymore. One thing hasn't changed. We're all still friends. I guess we'll always be friends.
