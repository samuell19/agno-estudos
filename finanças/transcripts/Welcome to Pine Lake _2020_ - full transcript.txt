Enjoy. - We are cosmic gospel hour. - Here we are. - Hymns for this America. Yes. America. Ah! Thank you guys for listening to us. This is a kind of hymn. It is a kind of protest and it is unexpected to call it both. We dedicate this song to two people, a professor and a judge. The professor is Christine Blassey Ford. The judge is our local municipal judge. Judge L'Erin Barnes Wiggins. - It is awesome. - If you know anything about our local judge, then you will not lose heart. Christine Blassey Ford, Dr. Ford. Judge Wiggins this is for you. Oh beautiful, for spacious skies For amber waves of grain For purple mountain majesties Above the fruited plain America! America! God shed His grace on thee. - There we go. we're not even put together yet. - Oh! - All right. - All right. - Hey man, thank you so much. Appreciate it. All right. - Bye now. - Bye. Thank you.

Call the meeting to order. - I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which is stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. - Thank you. That was awesome. What did she do? - Right in there? - And she scored. - Headcount, headcount - Look out, look out. It's a run for Pine Lake city council. All right. Announcements and communication. Who would like to start? - You should have the check engine light. - We had to check engine light, it's still long - Okay. We trying say something he say, there's something going on in the electrical Nobody can tell me what's going on. - Well let me scan it for us real quick. And then I'll see. - All right. - I just call it like a little sleepy, little quaint town. At the time, when I first came here, the Pine Lake police department was 100% white. And at that time they had 10 police cars. They patrolled 24/7, seven days a week. - My mom, my dad moved out out here, not too far from here right down the street of Rockbridge. And we, we will finding ourselves journeying, just getting out with the basketball, walking around the neighborhood. Find ourself wandering off too far. And we weren't wondering into Pine Lake - Pine Lake is predominantly white and, but the surrounding area is 90% black. 20,000 cars a day come up and down Rockbridge road. Somebody is gonna get pulled over. - And God forbid, if you had to come through Pine Lake and you still had to go through, a Stone Mountain, 'cause you'd get a ticket in Pine Lake and harassed like crazy and get locked up in Stone Mountain, like dude, how's that possible! But it always happened like that. And so we always try to avoid this area. - There were complaints made, against the force about profiling black drivers in this area. - Pine Lake's chief of police Matt McGlamory says he can't apologize for writing those tickets. He says nearly all the tickets are written for expired tags, no proof of insurance suspended or revoked licenses. $830,000 generated by tickets and court calls. They involve themselves in what I call predatory policing. Some say the police stop you for no reason at all. - The judge, the prosecutor or the clerk everybody was waiting like. - After the situation, they got diverse. And Chief Green was the first black officer they hired and she was a female. So I guess she fitted two quotas. - Took me 30 minutes running late, going from gas station to gas station, just to find the place. I'm like you know, it's like, this little place with this huge name. This little place is what y'all talking about. It was like, what the hell did I just walk into? - No more your body, only thing that's really moving is, your arms. - You come into work and want to do a great job. And every time you hear it, it's like, Pine Lake. I was kinda like, just trying to pick up the pieces from a department that was basically almost shattered. People of Pine Lake, almost aloof, like what did we do? Hey, Roger, how was the funeral? - It was cool. - You didn't call me. - It was cool. A lot of crying going on. - Yeah. - A lot of police officers are assholes and they act a certain way. She trains all her guys to be cordial and stuff because you know back in the day, the hammer was getting brought down. You pull through, boom ticket. You might not even have a ticket. You're gonna have a ticket. - You know, whatever issues and concerns, have on some level been addressed. So now you have the name. Unfortunately, we carry bad a lot further than good. - When you got a name that people recognize and they gonna respect you, no matter what, that aren't bad. They built that name and people respect it. You don't mess with Pine Lake. They just living a life that's calm and you don't mess with them. - Prior to being the judge in Pine Lake, I was the solicitor. That was my first introduction to Pine Lake. It started to dawn on me that the makeup of the defendants seemed to reflect quite differently from residents. And so you think, why is this? Or do you think, why is this, right? Is this just the norm? - You mentioned a question they were thinking about. - They had been thinking about parking tickets which I'm really totally against. I just don't think it's, I don't think it's going to issue you know, get a lot of people in. Maybe for court, maybe throughout the summer. - You know, it looks bad to me. - So sign this for me. 27 of September at 2 O'clock, you're gonna come back and bring your license with you, Okay? - Yes your honor. - You can always talk to the solicitor and see if you can work out a plea deal. - I don't know. I'm just, I don't know. - Okay. Why don't you put you talk to the solicitor. So just have a seat for me and she'll call you up in a minute. Hi, your last name. - All Rise. The Municipal Court for the City of Pine Lake is now in session. The Honorable Judge Wiggins presiding. - Good afternoon everyone. Please be seated. Welcome to the city of Pine Lake. Today is an arraignment day and we have two calendars. Shortly we'll have some inmates coming over from the DeKalb County, but for the rest of you that are here, it's your arraignment day. This is your first opportunity to respond to the charges that are pending against you. This court has the jurisdiction to sentence you up to 12 months in jail and a fine of up to $1000, if you charged with a traffic citation. And it doesn't bother me but if the other people can't hear the rights do you, are you the one with the ticket? You are, okay. She's up front, Miss Harris, this is not your first following, too closely. - All of a sudden it was a, they stopped short, very short. - You might have to keep to call it away from the car in front of you to avoid that. - I was doing a good deed for somebody. I was wrong understood. Understood, - But I was trying to be a good Samaritan. - Raise your right hand. Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth under the penalties of perjury, sir? - Yes. Ma'am. - Mr. Smith, you were charged with suspended registration. That's being amended to an expired registration based on your conversation with the solicitor. Is that correct? - Yes Ma'am. - Then you're charged with one count of expired tag. How do you wish to plead? - Guilty? - Guilty? You have one kind of expired tag, how you pleading to it? - Guilty. I'm just, I'm trying, and... - What kind of business do you have? - I do eyelashes. - Okay. - Only eyelashes, eyelashes only. - Awesome. That's a new happening thing, - It is. - for which I take part in. - You do. - I do. - Can I give you my advertising. - Let's finish your case first. - Okay. - So what happened? Why did you fail to report? - Because I moved to the other side of town in Duluth, with my new job and I lost my job, my mother, and my brother died. I mean, life just happened to me. I mean, I had no way of getting back on this side of town. I mean, you know, my means of working was to pay for where I am staying, I mean I'm homeless, so, motel fees is like 500 dollars a week, I mean 498. If I don't play it then, me, my wife, my granddaughter out on the streets. So that's why I didn't report. I mean, you know, I mean, I'm just being as honest as I can. - So let me just say, to say this to you, you understand that, even if you can't pay, try to make contact. should you find yourself in this position again. Try to at least make contact with the probation officer say "Hey," Exactly what you told me, "Life has happened to me, and I'm having a hard time. What can I do?" Cause I know that this is a responsibility out there that I got to take care of. But given the circumstances I don't know how I'm able to. But just disappearing is not an option. You understand? - Yes Ma'am. Yes your honor. But if you just gave me till Monday - You gonna get out today. I time served you. - Oh thank Jesus! Gone are the dark clouds That had me blind - You sound pretty good. You're, listen to her a little bit more. Listen to the guitar for your pitch. And you're feeling like you're dragging a little bit. Watch me keep, the energy up. Keep with, we're lift, lift lift. Everything tonight is lifting up, lifting up, lifting up. Nothing but blue skies Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah First song we're gonna sing is called "Humble." And it really much embraces the idea of how important it is for us to understand that we're in relationship with the earth. And if, if there's a place to live in the world where you can experience that it's Pine Lake, right? Yes? - Yes. We really can. We really are gifted and blessed in that way. Humble yourself to the first of the sun. Get out and send down low and Humble yourself to the force of the sun You gotta see what he shows And we will lift each up - Now we need everything done. This is the shorter nicer one that I like. - Goes on the porch. - Here you can help hold it. - I don't think it really matters for female or male if you do the job well. That's what we elect people who do the job well. I didn't even really notice that everybody was female. - Until you mentioned it - I think most of the men out here are enlightened. That's the reason we're cooking. - I don't think anybody thinks about that. - You know what? You're so comfortable with? - I know, exactly. - It's not an issue. - That's right, 'cause you're a man, I'm a woman. - It's wrong. - That's what it is. It's so binary, but it's not binary anymore because This is this is 2,000 and some year or something. Bring us a thing of hotdogs and some hamburgers - ] I've been asked that question a lot. Why are most of the people in the courtroom Black and most of the people in Pine Lake are white? I'm gonna give you the logistical answer. Rockbridge Road within Pine Lake's city limits and who's driving up there. All kinds of folks were up there. And that's where the majority of the traffic stops come from. - Unfortunately, you can go in just about any courtroom in America and you'll see those same optics. Some more situational. some are unfortunately purposeful. I mean, that's just the truth. But here in our city court, like I said, the optics kind of suck for me sometime. But I have confidence in our officers and their ethics. - I think we have three full time officers and some part time and mostly reserves. Traffic sort of pays for the police department-ish. It's like a break even, there. - For those of you that have decided to move forward with your bench trial, I will take those next so we can get our officers back on the street, okay? All right, so that fine is $600, which is reduced from $750 because you have solved the problem. It's good that she got it fixed because I'll reduce your fine, okay? - Yes ma'am. - That fine would be $150 ma'am, do you need time to pay that? - Yes ma'am, give me till Friday. - I'll reduce that fine to $600 sir. Did you need time to pay that? - Yes ma'am. - Can I do community service, I cannot afford $600. - Ma'am, I will place your probation for 12 months, to pay a fine of $600 or complete the equivalent in community service hours. So does that mean you want to plead not guilty and have a trial that you're challenging what you were charged with? I can't hear you. - Why do you need a trial for... - Well I don't need one, do you need one? - No. - Okay, so you want to enter a plea of guilty to the charge? - Yes, I'm trying to get it over with - I know, but you've gotta know what your rights are, before we just get it over with. - You asking me, do I want on to get it over with? - That's not what I asked you. - You don't what a trial? - Yeah. - How do you wanna plead to the charge of posting signs on poles and trees? - Not guilty. - Not guilty. - Yeah. - That mean you want a trial - I was just trying to get over it. - I understand. But you got rights. - Yes. - Welcome. Thank you for coming tonight. - Let's adopt to the agenda. We have the consent agenda, do you have a motion to adapt? - We are a strong mayor form of government, which means the mayor is the CEO, the boss of everybody. The mayor is at the top of the flowchart. - They have come before you with an informal request to subdivide. My recommendation is that before you can formally subdivide it, they would have to meet those requirements in terms of recordable plat. - We are in the position to informally, that was the word you used Laurel, approve this subdivision or in the position to wait for the platting to formally approve this subdivision. Is that our. Those are our options? - Those are your options, and if you have specimen trees, then you're going to have to replace trees on the lot that are removed in other fashions. So they will be younger trees or certainly not going to be mature oak trees. - That actually doesn't really do much in terms of ecological value, because the relationship that it has with forest is not really replaced by small caliber trees. - You can't build anything on it without destroying all three of those trees, whether, directly cutting them down or putting them in a point where they're not going to be preserved. - Public Comments. Yes, come to the podium, please. - My comment simply is that I would request that the city or the council consider this, but not vote on it tonight until we've had some opportunity to find out what it really is gonna look like and the impact that it may have on the immediate neighbors as well as on the town itself. - Thank you. - These are things that are very important to not just, the ethos of the residents of the city, but these are things that actually make the city survive and make the lake clean. Trees are really part of the equipment here. If you want to kind of make it very unphilosophic and unpoetic, I think we need to wait on a document that has more information before we do take any action. - Yeah, I agree. - I agree. - Okay All right. All in favor. - I - I. - Boom. - I'm a part time mayor. I make 3600 bucks a year. - All right, I don't have... Our council makes $599 a year. That is not their main gig. It may be in their heart and soul, but it is not in their bank accounts. - Would you welcome the next Governor of the great state of Georgia, Stacey Abrams. - I have the opportunity, yes, to be the first black woman to be governor in the history of the United States. But I don't want anyone to elect me because I'm Black. I don't want anyone to hire me for this job because I'm a woman. But I want them to know that as a Black woman, if I can get this job, I can get anything done in the state of Georgia. That's why I'm running. - And after that, you hear a bloop. The bloop us to notify you that someone is on the line at that point, you will start with our script. Hi, my name is. I'll be Beyoncé. Hi. My name is Beyoncé and I'm volunteering on behalf of Stacey Abrams for Governor. Sara Riggs Amico or the city Governor. John Barrow for secretary of state and other Democrats across Georgia. - Yes, hi. My name is August Woods and I am a volunteer on behalf of Stacey Abrams for Governor... - Hi, my name is Melanie Hammet. I'm volunteering on behalf of Stacey Abrams for Governor and Sarah Riggs Amico for Lieutenant Governor, and John Barrow for Secretary of State and Democrats across Georgia. How's your evening going?

I'm Augusta Woods and I'm a volunteer on behalf of Stacey Abrams for Governor and Sarah Riggs Amico for Lieutenant Governor and John Barrow for secretary of state. - I am killing it. I'm killing something here. - First hung up. - She got a hung up. - Okay, Ive gotten one Republican, six hang ups, a fax and a woman that said "I'm sleeping." - All right everybody go ahead and wrap it up. - All right Miss One hangup - I can't believe it. - How did that that happen. - I'm just in the process of getting my license re-instated and I haven't been financially able, to just go to the DMV and give them $1200. - Yes. It's gonna be, it's gonna be costly. - How long do you need? - To bring proof for the re-instatement papers? - No. To bring the license. - Put me on the calendar for next month. - You sure? Be realistic. Now $1200 don't just jump up. - Yeah. And if it does, tell me where I need to go. - Is it too much to ask for a couple of months? - No, it is not. Thank you, thank you. - There's nothing more fun than riding unicycle. - Welcome to Pine Lake Reads Pine Lake Reads is our podcast series as a part of our public library book booths. I'm Melanie Hammet, your host and the mayor of the City of Pine Lake. - You're gonna read and then you and I are gonna do a little bit of talking. So that'll be a part of the podcast. So I'll ask you some questions. - Did you guys realize that this weekend is my birthday? - Oh yes. And same day as your son getting a bar mitzvah. - Yes. - Right? - Or having his bar mitzvah, I guess that's... - I don't know. - Oh but ah! - Saturday. Saturday is your birthday? - Yeah. - She will be 30 years old. - You know it. - You're doing great, you're doing perfect. - The Pine Lake Police Department, a good day. The Pine Lake Police Department is comprised of a number of individuals, all of whom, sworn to serve and protect the residents of Pine Lake, the Dekalb County and the state of Georgia. - You never, ever can park that close to the corner, okay? - Yes ma'am. - Thank you. - Thank you. - That is not deemed a legal sign. We don't do flag signs. - Okay. So I'm new over here. - That's okay, that's okay. This one is cool. This one is fine. It's that? That wavy one - Okay. - See another thing about signs too, as you want to think about driver right away. You see, if I was backing through here... - We encounter many things in the course of a day. Some seem almost routine, but others not so routine. Hey, let me ask you a question. What are you guys doing? - We on the gas line. - Gas line, I just saw... What you have Georgia power on your thing? - What do y'all do? You're filming? - we are. - An episode of cops? - No, actually we're doing a 2019 calendar. We're looking for guys in hard hats that maybe have shovels - Are we gonna be on TV? We're thinking we gonna just.. - If we are gonna be in a calendar year. We'll all take our shirts off. - That's what I'm talking about. - Go, go get some other underwear on we'll come out here and work with vests on. Just vest. - Oh, I liked that. - Somebody got a water hose? No, I'm just teasing. No, I knew I was asking you because I wanted to know but I'm sorry, I'm Chief Green. So I do some of the code compliance too. - Okay. - And I don't know if y'all know what y'all doing. Cause every time y'all start damn digging we ended up evacuating people - Today you will not, - Oh! - we know what we're doing. - Oh! - I promise you today. - Next time I'm gonna look for the guy with the orange hat on. - See you later, baby - Thank you guys. Have a good one. You know where everybody lives, you actually engage. You're not necessarily jumping from call to call to call. So, when you're not jumping from call to call, it allows you to do the kitten in the tree, crossing the old lady across the street. It allows you to do those types of things. What's today, blue day, you got the blue hat. They got the blue shirts and you got the blue stairwell. So nobody sent me a memo. I didn't get the memo - You need a memo? - What's your name ma'am? - Chief Green. - Chief Green - Yes sir. - You the chief? - Yeah. - Would you want to eat this morning? - Oh, I'm good. - May I buy you some breakfast? - I'm on a diet. - My car is giving me hell. - You gotta tire issue. Mr. Collin is gonna hook you up. Each person that has made the life decision to put on this uniform has a love for humanity. A desire to serve, protect, and be a part of something greater than themselves. - I remembered that as a poem, it felt to me like a poem. Did you send it to me, because it was your way of also saying to the new mayor I want you to see us. - This is who you have and you are employed. This is who we are. And I wanted it to be a certain level of comfortability too. - Chief Y'hudah Green. It's an honor, and a pleasure to continue working with you. And thank you for agreeing to do this. - I'm definitely humbled. I thank you for allowing me the opportunity to even open up and show that other side. - I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. - Announcements, communications. - Hi, how are you? - Hi. - Very good. - Hi there. - Hey - Hey. - I didn't know where folks were coming from with milkweed and the different times there are and how rigid folks are sticking to just the kind of the three native American milkweed. The one that we used in Florida... - Seed is the Stewards for Environmental Education and Design. And they wanted to do a summer project. And Jennifer said, "What about a Monarch way station?" - The idea behind the Monarch way station is to provide a little bit of respite on the annual migratory path of the Monarch butterflies. - You damn dog. - This is really how things start to grow literally and figuratively in a city our size, especially. - What kind of a place are we making? The three main things, right? That's kind of the real kind of a thematic. And whenever we talk about Pine Lake it's arts, our arts or environment and our community, also the relationship with the larger community. And how do we not be this little enclave. And how do we not be exclusive. - You know the Mayor? - You know the Mayor for Pine Lake? Have you seen the mayor? - Who? - The mayor for Pine Lake, yeah. - You have a business district that is predominantly black in a city that's predominantly white and as long as there is that separation that's going to create some issues. - And you don't have any conversation with us. You know we don't know any future plans. How we can help. I'm sure you're talking about how we play a negative role in situations. - We really don't have a lot to work with as far as good, attractive businesses. And I'm not discounting the wonderful people making a living up there. - Right? - The older ones want it peaceful and quiet. They want to be tucked away, hidden. They don't want to be bothered. But then you got some newer, younger ones that got little kids. They come in and, hey, we need a Starbucks. We need a Whole Foods, we need, you know... - The problem is, is that right now Rockbridge doesn't have any elements of Pine Lake, Rockbridge, to put the colloquialism that our past mayor put on it is Rockbridge is a freaking armpit. - You have to look at what's gonna make us sustainable and what's gonna be able to keep our city going without out taxing our citizens. And I think that all leads back into developing our business area because we've got to have some other sources of income. - One of the things that works is our socio economic diversity. And somehow we also have affordable, still affordable properties to buy. If we eradicate our socioeconomic diversity, I will fall into the pit of despair. Pine Lake is at an economic anomaly. How many cities with less than a third of people have a police department. I mean, how many how many you have a beach? - we're running a country club on shoestring budget. - We're running a country club on a shoestring budget. - You sit and look at the pumps and watch up to who's pulling up at the pumps. They are not supporting their own community The shell gas station is in the heart of, the heart of the neighborhood - mm-mmh. - Must be another gas station back there. Or something, in Pine Lake - My interest is, what happens in our commercial district. And can we build to a bigger, bigger Pine Lake? And I don't mean that geographically. - We all kind of have this, ewwwwmthing about the Rockbridge Road. I mean, the businesses up there are not businesses that we necessarily are very interested in in frequenting, but we need to change that attitude. We need, we need to support those businesses. And we need to build that. - we're working to roll out steps to have visible results on Rockbridge road. - This could be one of the small little cities to show other cities how to conduct themselves and how to do things. You know what I'm saying? But they haven't, we don't have that relationship yet. They haven't coming out here to speak to us. - Make a right, man You are gonna hit the curb, make a right. Ow! Ow! - The, the only thing that they could work on is, is trying to push, you know, Pine Lake forward. - Okay. Just tell me when to start or how they fit, okay? - Okay. Thank you. I feel a little bit protected. I felt a little bit like they are handling their business in Pine Lake. And I when I come to work, I feel good to come to Pine Lake. - I don't have a problem, I feel good. You know, I don't have to travel out of my neighborhood, I'm right here. I'm around good people. You know what I'm talking about, getting cuts like this. We out here, we been out here. You know what I'm saying? That's the world we live in, man. - Men lie, women lie, the pumps don't. - The pumps don't. - I pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible. with liberty and justice for all - It's easy to use slogans, it's easy to offer gimmicks. But you can put your money and your words where your mouth is. - Yeah. - You got to tell folks where you plan to lead them. If you want them to follow. I will be the first black woman to be a governor in the history of our country. But that history only matters, if we make Georgia the state that everyone follows. If we use our platform and our position and opportunity, to create real change, to lift up those who are vulnerable, to protect those who are lost, and to see those who believe no one understands their needs. - Do you guys want to get started with something to eat or do you want me to just jump right in? You see, I'm trying to watch this girlish figure I have. That's rapidly transforming. I'd just like to balance it out, you know, have some fruits and vegetables. I need some sugar. We pray for the city of Pine Lake that it will continue to strive, and be what the people there would like to have it to be. We ask all these things in Jesus' name, Amen. - Amen. - And we have Chief Green, is the Chief of Police of Pine Lake is gonna come and talk to us and we are glad to you all with us today So, I'm gonna turn it over to her. - Good morning. When I was asked to come here, I said, these guys know just about every dagone hing there is, so what do I like to come and share with them. So today I'd like to share with you guys about, Senior Safety. You need to be safe inside your house as well as when you're out and about. When I say senior safety, what do you think about? - Telephone calls, that seniors are getting. They're pretending to be your grandchildren. - Oh yes! Oh that's a good one. - And the IRS is gonna come - Oh yeah, and get you right now and - This is a circle, this is why I love my SALT group, with Seniors in law enforcement together. So you tell me we put it in the bank. We process it out, we get information, we share it with you guys. And we're educated, and we're safe. We are really not, you know, living up to our potential. But by shelving, this whole population in our society. I don't like to see people left behind. So with regard to seniors, I'm just kind of crazy about them. We talk about the fraudulent aging cream. You guys look great a season. It's a little salt and pepper on it. Deal with it. Like I said, you guys are living longer and that's a blessing. Don't fall for it. Don't fall for the banana in the tailpipe. I like to say, I waw a Kroger bag, hanging from the mirror with the phone right here. No, ma'am, that's not hands free. I mean, technically your hands is free but I'm just thinking that's, that's pretty creative. - WE are going, - to get you a job someplace 629 fatalities with 64% being because of seat belts and phones. It's so not acceptable. It's a waste. It's hard to get here. Hard to stay. So easy to go. And you guys, you guys are original gangsters of y'all gotta been there, done that. We want to keep you around a little while longer. So thank you. This was the diet chocolate that you were telling me about. Oh, I love it. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. - It is Kroger candy coating, - mmh. - And vanila candy coating and dry roasted peanuts. - I like it, wow! - And I eat three or four of those things every day. - Okay, well, that's the secret to your success. I'm gonna try it. I don't know if it's gonna work out, but I'm definitely willing to give it a try. - Hello, - We have a tiny budget to match our tiny beach, to match our tiny Lake. So what we have is we have, we have police officers and there's a little, there's some dissonance, I think in that. You have this sort of police presence at the beach intermittently, sending a signal of behave on the beach. - Going down there, I never really had no problems, but I've had officers slow down and ride and just sit there and watch me while I swim. And definitely if you see me out there with my four year old daughter in the water, I can't be doing too much hard. You know? And then, I mean, I'm obviously not armed. I got on swimming trunks. It's a beautiful site. They got the trails on each side of the Lake. You know, you got turtles. You can see you're swimming with turtle and fish. I'm just a nature person. So I love nature in general. - We also have wildlife that we're really protective of. All of these things, all the ecosystems literal and figurative have to be kept in balance. The lake full signs should be before people get out their cars, get all the kids together, whatever stops them as soon as possible, because if I got a whole car, all my stuff out, I got all the kids and I get all the way up here, and I see lake full, oh my gosh! I would be like, kah! - You haven't been drinking? - No, ma'am, I need something to drink. I'm sorry. Did you get it that, thank you card I sent? - I did. I was gonna get to that, to thank you for the thank you. - Get used to them because, and I'm a giver, but if you can just, I can stay on probation. I want to do my probation here in Pine Lake but I couldn't be lifting stuff. I couldn't lift stuff. - Understood. - So, I went to the Tupac center and they wrote the letters and me and the probation we been getting along, but. - But I'm glad to hear that you haven't been drinking. - Oh yes Ma'am. - And don't you feel better? - Yes Ma'am. - You do. You look better. I know I see you got your good suit on. - I borrowed. - But I'm telling you, you'll be much better off. - On probation? - No, no sober. - Sober. - Well, it sounds as if you have completed all the conditions of your probation, is that, is that your understanding? - Yes ma'am. - Alright, so we're gonna close it out. You're off probation, Okay? Alright. Good luck to you. - Oh, excuse me. - Yes. - I got a sense of humor. You think I didn't get a couple of 20s from you? I'm just joking. - See you later sir. Take care, okay? - What would a vibrant and well-supported Rockbridge Road do for a strong future city? 22,000 cars a day and not a single one of them has had any indication that the residents or government of Pine Lake exists or cares. - In the past, people who live here wanted to keep it their little secret. And they really didn't want to encourage others to come in. And I think they're going to run across that same attitude in a lot of people. - And if you're African-American, there's a history. Am I gonna be... ...gonna be arrested? Am I gonna be OK. - Every African-American friend I have, that's the first comment out of their mouth. You live in Pine Lake? I'm not gonna come visit. - When we talk about economic development, my first question really is what, what does that mean? I don't have a problem with what Rockbridge Road looks like. What I have a problem with is, you don't know you're in Pine Lake. - Hi. How are you? - Hi. I'm well, how are you? - How can I help you with? - I came to pay off a warrant and the ticket? - You Ms. Gomes? - Yes. That was so scary, I've never been to jail. - I won't put you in jail. $392. - Never felt so good to give so much money away. - I swear. - That was horrible. They made me take a mugshot and they wouldn't let me like look in the mirror first. - No, they don't. They don't let you look in the mirror. - They laughed at me when I asked for a bottle of water and a blanket. They was like, "Do you want to go to population?" I was like, yeah, so send me to population. If I get a blanket in there, they're like, "No, sweetie." - You don't wanna go to population. - I Know nothing about jail. - You don't wanna go to population. - I was like Yes. I mean, do I get botttles of water in there too? - No baby. - I don't eat meat. And they told me that they don't recognize pescatarian. So they kept on trying to give me a ham sandwich. - [Jennifer Yeah. They don't rec... They don't recognize anything in jail, especially in the Clayton County jail. - Yeah. It wasn't friendly or kind. I don't like it. - I'm sorry. - I'm never going back. - This is your receipt. You're all paid in full. - I'm free Free. - She's free? - I'm free free. I'm not just free. I'm free free. - Alright. - Today's the 30 - 30th. - Halloween's tomorrow. - Yeah. Halloween is tomorrow. - Okay. So you're done. Unless you want to come back to court for some reason, that's tough. - No. - This was a great interaction. I fully enjoyed it, but I think this is all I needed. All right, you're done. You don't have to come back to court. This ticket's paid. You're finished. - Even with Clayton County and stuff. - Well Clayton County that's different. That's a whole different situation. Wait about two weeks and then start calling. - Okay. - I used to live in Clayton County. So I Understood. Okay. - I appreciate your help. - That's some extra words of advice right there. - oh, trust me. I'll take whatever, I ain't going back to jail. - Just make sure start calling, Douglas, Clayton County state court in about two weeks. - Thank you very much. - No problem. Be safe. Be careful. - Have a good one. - I'm a free women. - You have to kind of school them, because they really don't know. They don't know any better. They don't know any better. - Did you read your ticket? No. - Nope. You don't get to tell them what you want to eat in jail. - What they do send round a menu for you to choose. - Like your in the hospital. Make sure you call downstairs to room service. - I don't know what they're thinking - That means she would probably have to live off of bread and water. - Pescatarians will eat anything but red meat. Pescatarians will eat fish and seafood, but you know they don't. They might have fish stick night at the jail. - Oh my goodness! Isn't that funny? Wow! - They might have fish stickes in jail. - They don't get it. Young people just don't get it. - They don't. - I feel sorry for our future leaders of America. If they're gonna be leading us, we're doomed. - But these are our future leaders of America. - So they say, Ooh! - Molly said there would be an extension cord and ideally I would put it into the lawn and hook it up, and plug it in. I brought it down at Charlotte's request. I think just to symbolize we got some love going on. And yes. Tah Dah Wait till it gets dark. It'll be beautiful. - No matter what kind of stressful day I have, when I start down the roads towards the Lake, you just take a deep breath. And it's like, all is well, you know, it's just it really. So the parties are always, just delightful. I think it's the, the diversity of all the neighbors. And then you have like-minded neighbors. So, people who have lived here you know, they move in and then, they're like they never move out. Oh, I think we have our first guests. - Hi there - I got Mavis's vest! Well-behaved women, rarely make history. I love it. Everybody this is Claire with the Enchanting Vineyard. Oh my God! You should go check it out. - There are still grapes on the vine. - And she makes all these outfits. - When I first came here I was like, I had just camped with my friend. We went to the Grand Canyon, and we camped the whole way there. And I came back and I was like, I just wanna camp for the rest of my life. Like I could just live in a campground. And then I saw this place and I was like, "Oh, I can camp for the rest of my life." But with a really good bed and toilet. - You guys live in Pine Lake? - Yeah we do. - We live on the other side of the lake, on Dahlia Do you know my Melanie, the mayor lives? - No, she lives over there? - Ah OK. She's catty corner. - Yeah. - So you guys are very close to her. There's a purple iridescent with like sequins, - Oh my God. - They were so stunning. - It's always been that like, you know, men are the leaders. You know, that's not true. That's really not. Anyone can be a leader. And I'm not saying that men aren't good leaders. And I'm not saying that women are better than men, but I feel like we're all equal. That we shouldn't judge people. Women can run this place, and we do a good job. - The loose dog situation is ridiculous. We have too many loose dogs. This is not a dogs run free zone. We are not on a farm, right? This is not the Sound of Music where the dog comes running up over the Hill, like Julie Andrews. So please spread the word. Call animal control on loose dogs and fill out a citation. Let's get this handled. - I hate the whole color scheme. I just want to be clear. - To me it's not an accent wall, if it's the same, same color as the bottom. And if you're really going to make it pop or something. It needs to be even on third color, right? - You got to have eyelashes just to make it look good. See. - They would never know that anything got changed, if we don't... - If we don't change something. - I don't know. - Ew. - I just realized that it was on number two. - You are the analyst I'm the indecisive one, all right? - Do we need to get together again? - Hell no. - Thank you, Marty. Oh, Charlotte, sir. - Get 12 people, you get 12 different opinions. You need two people make a decision. Women are gonna discuss it to death. - It'll all be good in the end. - I grew up in this town, I'm in the house I grew up in. I liked the lake back like it was when I was a kid. Back when we were private, had fence around it and if you were a child, you were registered, you go in. Everybody knew the policemen they were just down on the beach. You know, "I know your Momma" if you get in trouble. They knew about it for you got home. We used to be one of the safest cities. I think we are still way up there. I think probably the thing that keeps us safe and keeps people liking it is the police force. If we didn't have our police force and our mayor, making good decisions for us. It might not be a sweet little town like it is. We're left back here by ourselves. It could turn into, a spooky place, I think. I like I like, I like, Yeah, I like. - I see you. - Do that again. Oh, I love it. - Ew. - Oh my God.! My staff was like, can we leave early today? - I know - I'm like what the fuck is this, Thanksgiving? - I see you, I see you. - Happy Halloween. - I'm gonna get her. Gotcha you. - I like it, I like it. Oh yeah, that's awesome. - Happy Halloween officer. - Happy Halloween. - Happy Halloween. - Happy Halloween. We got some candy. We got some candy. We got some candy. We got some candy, We got some candy, We got some candy, We got some candy, We got some candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy. I got Candy on the foot, Candy on the foot, Candy on the foot, Candy on the foot. Candy on the foot. Candy on the foot. Candy on the foot. Candy, I got some candy on the foot. Look who we got into the witches. We got some candy, We got some candy, candy candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy. We got some.... We got some candy, I got some candy. - Can we get some? Candy, candy. - My opponent in this race is an architect of voter oppression. Who has done everything in his power to scare people out of voting. He said, look, he is concerned that if everyone who is eligible to vote in Georgia casts a ballot, that he won't win. Let's prove him right. Let's prove it him right. Let's prove him right. - The whole climate of Georgia is at stake today. We going to either stay the same or be worse or we're gonna have some major changes and have a brighter future for Georgia as a state. Nobody in Pine Lake should have an excuse not to go vote when it's like walking distance and no line. I've tried to hold my excitement for tonight. So when I hold up my sigh I scream. "Stacey, the Governor" I still have a voice. - Stacey, Stacey, Stacey, Stacey, Stacey, Stacey, Stacey, Stacey, Stacey, Stacey, Stacey, Stacey, Stacey. - You can do better than that. How's everybody doing tonight? - Stacey's campaign has injected a sense of, a greater sense of hope in the State of Georgia. - In some cases, there were too few machines in some cases the touch screens didn't seem to work well. In some places there was a problem getting power into machines. Riding on this has been the governor's race it has been a nasty affair, Democrat Stacey Abrams has accused Republican Brian Kemp The states, secretary of state, of voter suppression Particularly in minority communities - We can win, and we must win. Be hopeful, be optimistic. And keep your eyes on the prize. - It's going to still be a long night. This is not ending soon. And we're unlikely to have anything definitive to say until the morning. - Tonight we have closed the gap between yesterday and tomorrow. But we still have a few more miles to go. We are still on the verge of history and the best is yet to come. - We are Georgia. - We are Georgia. - We are Georgia. - We are Georgia. - So let's get it done, thank you so much. - I would have preferred a clean decision but I understand that you don't always get what you want. My responsibilities is to keep going until we get what we need. - Once we pay these, then once you pay this. - Once you pay this, I'll send a message to Dekalb County. This says this money has been paid his bond today and he can be released. Okay cool. - Okay? . - Okay, I will be right back. - Okay, yes ma'am. - Okay, it's 50 dollars, you get your case reset. Let me get your receipt. A lot of times you don't know what person comes in and you don't know if they're upset or if they need help. A lot of times people come in upset because he missed a court date. So you have to kind of calm him down and talk to him and tell him it's going to be okay. But I like interacting with people. I'm a people person. - Bring all that with you. Bring your tag, bring your VIN number. Bring everything with you okay? Sign out there where it says defendant. - The business district is critical to the growth of the city of Pine Lake. That's the only direction we can grow in. Moving City Hall up on Rockbridge Road will be a big first step in signaling that the city of Pine Lake is an entirety, not just a residential block. You just putting your money where your mouth is. - These are what y'all are gonna use today. They're labeled, address and the name. - Okay. - When you walk, this is the postmaster's. She's out of town and she's on vacation. - Okay. If you won't take it out of there after Tuesday, it's ready. - Okay. - Okay, here's reliable tire. So it's that way. Here's RCB - Some of them, the property owner is the business owner, but a lot of times it's not. - Right. - So we may wanna check those out and invite some of the owners by mail. - Okay, so you've got Collins up next. - I do. - Bringing you a imitation to, you probably already got it in an email, but the grand opening at City Hall. - Thanks ma'am that's me. I'll try. I will, I will. - We have donuts. - I will, I will. - I'm Mayor Hammet, I wanted to come and personally invite you to the grand opening of City Hall, the new city hall up here on Rockbridge Road on October 31st. - Where, where is going to be at? - It is gonna be right behind the Texaco station on Allgood. - What time? - Nine to 11. - A little flex. - We're gonna have a light breakfast buffet right down the street, it will be great. - Why don't we do do the across the street and then we can hit Family Dollar and the gap tooth. - There's a barbershop in there? - Yeah, right here. - I am looking to deliver an invitation to the grand opening of the Pine Lake City Hall up here in the business district. - Okay. - October 31st is your hand delivered invitation.

So you council people by the mayor. - Okay. - All the dignitaries, to the side, and chief. - Jean drove the train on this building, a part of the city of Pine Lake. And I'm so grateful to her because we are now part of our business district and we are delighted to be here. One, two, three. Here we go. Let's let's get inside. Pine Lake, Pine Lake, Pine Lake. We like to dance in the streets - I keep getting asked these questions, what is female leadership? What are police to the society? What are...Good Lord! I'm just a simple country guitar player. - Every time I can do a human to human, to human, to human, I feel like now I'm in my range when it becomes system to system to system to system. Now we're kind of outside of what I'm... I'm almost able to address. All right, here we go, here we go. - I have to be effective or attempt to be effective in the judicial system that was created by white Americans to oppress people of color. Otherwise, I can't say I'm upholding the oath. And even the personal oath that I take to do what's right. - Miss Evans are you ready? Good, come on up. How are you today ma'am? - I'm fine. - I just needs you to raise your right hand, please. Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth under the penalties of perjury? - I do. - Okay, Ms. Evans, you're here for a petition to revoke your probation, okay? You're entitled to a lawyer, though, in these proceedings. Do you want one? - Yes. - You do? - What other choice do I have? - To go forward without a lawyer. - And if I go forward without a lawyer? - Then you'll be going forward without a lawyer. - I'll take my chances and go forward without a lawyer. - You want to go forward without a lawyer. Do you wanna have an explanation? - During that time, I was homeless. I was calling to let you know that I was having problems as far as my place to stay and I was going through something with my job. I actually lost my job. Then my dad got diagnosed with prostate cancer. So, like a whole lot going on. At that point, I just lost it. - I didn't know what to do after than. - Are you back on your feet now? - Yes. I have a place to stay, I live with my sister I'm actually in school. I don't work, but I'm in college right now trying to turn my life around in some positive or constructive other than drifting like I used to. - Well, I do not violate people for not paying. But for not appearing, it's a different story, right? But I hear you about your living situation. And I hear you when you say that you have attempted to make a change so that you can get on with your life and be a productive citizen. We all should be given a second chance. I hear that. You have been in jail about seven days. I'm gonna give you credit for those days that you have done, I'm going to revoke 10 days. And so that means you have three days remaining to serve. And then this case will close. You will not have to pay the outstanding balance. You will just serve total 10 days and this case will close. You have any questions? - No ma'am. - If you just have a seat, you'll go back with the officer shortly. - Let's get to the latest on the coronavirus. The CDC issuing some guideline on how various institutions can safely reopen amid the governor. - Brian Kemp is allowing more businesses to reopen today. - So in today gatherings of more than 25 people will be allowed as long as you keep... - Mayor, Council, Section two, the mayor and the council hereby declare the playground, the beach, the lake, the beach house and a clubhouse are closed to the public until further notice. - Do you have a public comment you like to make about the beach? - Although it bums me out personally not to be able to use the beach, I think y'all are making a very wise decision. - I think it is the best decision to keep the beach closed for this one summer. - I am in full support of total closure. - I totally, completely support the resolution. I want to thank Mayor, you and the Council commission. for making these very difficult and courageous decisions. - Okay, thank you. - You welcome, thank you. Have you been sick? - No dear. - The list is on the left side. - Okay, okay. They all feel comfortable though. - All Rise - The municipal court of the city of Pine Lake is now in session. The Honorable Judge Wiggins presiding.- Good afternoon everybody. Welcome to the City of Pine Lake. - All right, all in favor. We are adjourned. Thank you guys for coming tonight. What would you think about having our next meeting outside, in a big circle, for some fresh air?
