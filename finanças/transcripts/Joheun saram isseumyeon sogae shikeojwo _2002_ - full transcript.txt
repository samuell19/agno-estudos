Hae-in That's enough It's already the 27th time Bastard Rotten bastard Son of a bitch How could you betray me for a one-month fling after we went out for seven years? Hyo-jin In that movie Fanny Pink The odds are greater for a woman over thirty To get hit by an atomic bomb than to find a nice man You believe that? - One of our clients - Be quiet, and listen to me! They're right Know why? Because... there isn't a nice guy in this world Hyo-jin how many bullets are there? One bullet maybe? One isn't enough That bastard has two hearts If not, then how could he love two women? The sun's up Revenge or not I'm sick of it Just tell him to get married Are my eyebrows weird?

Gonna see a midnight movie? Perhaps Hyo-jin, you'll be the first to get married Actually, I have something to tell you all That you're getting married? I'm right, huh? Don't say that it's my birthday today! I hate hearing that the most! You guys have misunderstood me I'm not getting married Because I hate dealing with family customs In other words marriage is business No one has married because of real love A woman who doesn't want to marry is selfish A guy who doesn't is a playboy That's society's prejudices If we get involved The number you have dialed is no longer in service Please check the number and try again Thanks for lunch Me, too I'll treat you all to a great lunch one day Always promises I'm sick of it I'm serious it'll be my treat Kim Hyo-in your eyebrows look better Who is she?

The team leader was supposed to do it He's really awesome He was the hunk of our club in college Any man who doesn't betray is fine But is it okay for me to do this? It's only been seven days since I broke up They say it takes three times as long to forget everything What are you talking about? You dated him for 7 years so you'll wait 21 years? Hurry so you can have your revenge He's a man of few words handsome and well-versed Height? Sorak Mountain There was a heavy rainfall warning Those great members Hyo-jin, you remember Yang-soo and Yong-suk, right? Yong-suk is at Samsung SDS now Yang-soo got married and immigrated to Canada As I expected that great guy Was as I expected Anyway... Anyway, we climbed up the mountain with all that we had Then dark clouds with thunder and rain suddenly appeared But we couldn't give up halfway So we gave it all... (I thought he was handsome) We got to reach the top So we finally reached the peak (Long time ago... ) The peak! That's funny Wow, I didn't know you liked mountains so much (A man of few words?) That's right, you like to travel You should ask a favor from Hae-in (Long time ago) If you take a trip come to my office We have lots of discounts I will Thank you Then We listened to what we cherished for ten years Ozzy Osborne's Good-bye to Romance Good-bye to Romance Ozzy Osborne He really is a man of few words ruled the world at one point (You're well-informed) The band was powerful without the use of effects Stage performance?

I'm already upset that nothing's going right My leg's gonna rip Joon-ah can I ask you something? This guy can't remember this girl's name It's not once but after seeing her twice So what kind of person is he? Simply... that he's not interested at all So what's he like? No, it's not me One of my clients keep forgetting a girl's name I better introduce him to someone else Lively like Meg Ryan dignified like Annette Benning and unpredictable like Nicole Kidman That's my type If possible I'd really like a younger guy Guys around my age are too worn out You should know Also, never a guy with a B blood type I've been through too many of those Mom, which type of girl did you oppose? No girls whose last name starts with vowels Mom, when are you gonna pick me up?
