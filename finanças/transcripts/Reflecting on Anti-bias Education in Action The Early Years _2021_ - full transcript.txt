Did you see Julie's new puppy? Huh? Juniper. She got a new puppy. No. And it was beautiful. It's super black like your shirt and fluffy. And it's a cute little... oh, my gosh, she has a cute little face. She was in the hallway this morning with Julie. Maybe we can take a walk over there later and see her. She's in Julie's office with baby Luna. Now there's two babies over there, a puppy and a real baby. Cute. I know. You just have to step back and look at your own biases. You do have to check yourself because there are some things that, wow, this is just not how I was raised. Oh, Zara, it's so beautiful and brown. Just like me and you. Me and Zara, made by Zara. I just love it. But I would say, coming into this kind of work, yeah, there is some soul searching like, look at yourself and look who you are. Look at who you are. It's a lot about who you are, how you feel as a human, your emotions, empathy towards others and yourself, too. It's all down to that. It's down to what kind of human do you want to be. So what do you have in there? Circles? Mhm. You can draw them in there. Look at your face. What do you notice about your lips? Children at this age are constantly looking at what's different, what's similar. We have different cheeks, different lips, different noses. Getting them to open up about who they are, being willing to be present in the classroom, sharing who they are whether it's just something that they like, I think it's the opportunity for them to become proud of who they are and their self-esteem and how they share that with others or how they might not want to. No. Do you want to show your self portrait, Emily? Yeah. What do you all think? I love it. What was... I noticed that you had added something here. What were those? I'm done. On yours... well, we're going to draw again, hon. They're cheeks. They're cheeks. And then I noticed your nose, too. Everyone has a different shaped nose on theirs. Mine is down. Yours is down. So you have a triangle going down like this, right? Mine is like a rectangle. And I noticed it's holding up your glasses. What shape is Zara's nose? What shape is your nose, Zara? Heart. Kind of it. It does. It has like kind of a heart shape to it. Mine is a little bit round. Mm-hmm. Yours is a little bit more rounded. Mine is like a rectangle. You feel like yours is a rectangle? Me, too. How about yours, Inou? Well I notice... look at... do you want to show yours? All right. Inou, do you want to pick it up and show it to your friends on the table? I think this is great, too. So Inou, one thing, one reason that I actually put you and Zara in the self-portrait group together is because both of you had something to say in the last self portrait that I thought was really interesting. So Zara, last time you were in the studio told me that... and Davis and Emily, you were in the same group as Zara, so you might remember, too. It's that Zara had said that when she watches fairytales that they don't draw boys with eyelashes. Joyce mentioned to me that... she said that when you looked in the mirror that you don't have eyelashes, but Zara was pointing out that boys have eyelashes, too. What do you think about that? Yes. What do you think about... do boys have eyelashes? Yes. Let's look in the mirror. So Davis, do you have eyelashes? Yeah. You can look in the mirror, too. I mean I have eyelashes. Me, too. Making sure that people are feeling comfortable with themselves comes from you being comfortable being yourself around others. So it's a lot of paralleling that with children and really getting them to show who their authentic selves are because they are getting to know who they are. And it's really important to really bring that up with confidence. What else can you add? I am done. Mhm. I'm done. You're feeling done? Let me see. Let's take a look at the mirror. Hair? Check. Eyebrows? Yeah, check. Let me see. Check. Eyes? Check. Check. Glasses? Check. Lips? Check. Ears? Check. I'm done. You can grab a book, bud. Good. A calendar. All right. This line was just an accident. I mean it's totally fine that you drew it that way. That's why... and that's another thing, another reason why we do it more than one time because just like when we read books, there are times where we see something one time, and then the next time we see something totally new. So that's why it's good to give activities a second try. So should we get started on working on our second self portrait? Yeah. All right. So I'm going to give you a piece of paper, now. Joanne, Ashim. Who speaks Korean in our classroom? Isaiah. Isaiah. Isaiah. Can we say,.. You know we are not saying correct, but we're trying, we're listening the family's good morning every single day to get the accent. And it's not easy, but we want every child to feel welcome in the classroom. And they know their language is coming up any time during the day. Who speaks Tigrinya in a classroom? Jo-el. I want them to be very strong, have the strong identity, culture and language. Like I speak Somali, and I'm so proud of it. And I just speaks Spanish, and I'm so proud of it. And I know my teachers can support me. Can we say, buenos días, buenos días. Who speaks Spanish in our classroom? Me. Teacher. You can do it Asher? And this book talks about what my family do in Mexico. I tried to bring something up about myself, my family. I bring the Tortillera. I've bring those books. My grandma has one of this one. We talk about how we make tortillas. So we make tortillas with a family who visits us. My great grandma made tortillas for my grandmother. The children be very engaged, but also they are doing what they love to do. I made a big tortilla. I know. I want them to bring who they are, and also I bring who I am. Way back when I was younger, I went to a school that was predominantly white, and I didn't feel confident in sharing who I was. I didn't see myself reflected, so it took me years to learn to be confident in who I am, and being in a space where I am now, the children know all about me, whether it's my culture, whether it's the language I speak at home or foods that I like to eat. Hi, this is me. I want to see children represented. I want them to see things that remind them of home, that remind them of their families, and that's really my first goal when I'm planning the environment, whether it's through books, whether it's through things in the dramatic play, whether it's through things that I'm asking them to bring from home to share. It's really important to me that they see something that reminds them of themselves, but also they're learning about their friends. We might have a few children that wear glasses. So having little glasses in the dramatic play area that... the first day of school, the children walk in, and there's a baby doll wearing glasses. And just to see the look on that child's face like, look, just like me, that the baby's wearing glasses. Or even for another child to point out, look, just like you. The baby has glasses. So things like that are really important to me but also finding ways for children to see differences that they might not have seen before, perhaps a different culture, a different language, a different race. So as we think about it is mirrors as well as windows. It's always good to bring up conversations about what we eat at home because they love to share what they eat at home and how they make it, especially. Who eats strawberries? Who eat strawberries? Who eats rice? What color is your rice that you eat? I've tried purple rice, brown rice, white rice, and yellow orangey rice. You tried all the colors of rice? Bringing up food conversations as they're eating, they are aware that not everyone eats the same things, not everyone likes the same tastes. Who speaks another language than English at their house? What do you speak at your house Khalid? Spanish. And what else? Hmm? And English. And what does your yaya speak? Somali. Remember? Yeah. What do you speak at your house, Khalid? Do you know what language Khalid speaks at his house? Do you know what he speaks at his house? Do you speak Oromo? Oromo. Oromo with an O at the end. O At the beginning O and then at the end O. O-ro-mo. I think the differences makes it fun for them to understand who they are, and that they're special and different from everyone else. Talking about the differences really helps them see that everyone is different and we can all still get along. Thank you. That's what having an anti-bias education creates. It just creates an empathetic human beings who can care for one another and take care of each other instead of just being isolated and kind of caring about themselves. It creates a much more connected community and larger world. We had a parent, who was in a wheelchair, who helped us to rethink how we designed our classroom, the space. The children were interested in him and his wheelchair. And we talked about what is the wheelchair for. I wanted to go deeper into that, so I had an assistant who came in to volunteer who was in a wheelchair. And she also was a great role model for children. And when you are in a classroom with someone who is different than you, you start to see different layers. And so at first, those wheelchairs were... that was the focus. And after a while it was this father liked to play basketball. And this woman, who was our volunteer, liked to read stories to children and had an amazing infectious laugh. And so the children started to see different layers, and that's really important to me. Yeah, because I was super... Some of their questions are kind of like throw you off. This making me thinking about... I had one child ask, why am I Black? And I was like, hmm, here I am. But it's like in those situations, it's like I don't want to leave them hanging, but I will tell them, let me think about that. Let me get back to you because I do want their questions to be answered. They want to know things like why my hair is not like their hair. They'll compare eye color, hair color. But your hair is curly, I'm like, oh, yeah, it's curly. We'll compare curly, straight. They're just four and five years old. They're curious, and every year we get it. They're so amazed with my hair. A huge part of anti-bias curriculum has to do with the relationship that you have with children. It's such a vulnerable place. You're sharing a lot about yourself. They're sharing a lot about themselves. It's pronounced Hyun-Hi, so I was pronouncing it wrong. I was pronouncing it phonetically which is like the letters, how it sounds, but it has a different pronunciation. Remember how we were talking about how my name isn't actually Veronica? And it's actually "Verr-o-nee-ca." And I grew up in Chicago, and I grew up in a community that reflected mine which was mostly like first generation immigrant Mexican families. Being a teacher of color, I think, is a provocation in and of itself sometimes, and that has come up. And when it comes to me, I think I'm a lot easier in answering the questions because I am very comfortable with my identity and my culture and have had many years to develop that. Right away in our classroom, we talk about our three rules which are, our feelings need to be safe, our bodies need to be safe, and our materials need to be safe. Part of that is we need to... children need to feel safe to be whoever they want to be. And that is what's happening in the dramatic play area that they are acting out different ways of being in the world. In one of my first morning meetings, I bring a skirt that I like to wear. I tell the children that I want to wear the skirt, but I want to make sure that I feel safe wearing a skirt in the classroom. And so I'm just a little bit afraid that someone might laugh or they might feel uncomfortable. So I just want you to know that sometimes I wear a skirt, and it's really comfortable. I like it. I like to spin around in it. That is one way to use my own personal things that I like to do as a model for dramatic play. And so the children get to be whoever they want to be. It's one of my goals with my teaching team to put out materials that are not gender specific so having lots of fabric, having materials that are open ended, having things such as doctor tools, and baby dolls, maybe with no clothes but just little pieces of fabric, and seeing the children come into that space. And without even saying it, they know this is a safe space to explore the different materials. And they're having conversations about what they're wearing. Oh, look at me. I made a skirt, or I made a cape. There's so many possibilities because the pieces of fabric aren't dictating what they're supposed to be dressed as, but it opens up this big world of endless play of so many things that they can be. Sometimes we'll do a persona doll story. We'll grab a book and put the doll in the situation we did. Me and Veronica did one with my doll's Black, her doll's Latina, that they couldn't be friends just because they had two different skin tones. And we were asking friends, is this fair? And they came up with so many solutions of why it's not fair. And it's like, if we just keep talking to them about this... there's that phrase, there's good in everybody. You got to see it. There's things that are different and unique about you. There's different things that are unique and different about other people. We're constantly listening. We're observing what the children are doing. Dramatic play, I mean, that's where they're always testing out those theories of the things that they're seeing in day-to-day life. They're playing it out because they want more information on it. They're curious. We've had arguments about, can't have two dads, can't have two moms. We had a little boy who said, that's not true because I have two moms. And I mean, he was heated. He really got angry about it. And it's like, why can't you? So we have to talk about things that are like, every family's not the same. Some have a mom and a dad, some have two dads, some only have a mom, some friends live with their grandparents or their aunties and uncles. So Huckleberries, today I want to introduce you to a new friend in our class. This, Huckleberries, is my friend Nash. It's their first day in our class. They're just looking around at all of you, and they're so curious to know who you all are. Today was fun. It was really interesting, though, knowing going in being like, I don't know what questions kiddos are going to have, or what they're going to say, which is both nerve racking but also kind of exciting. It's that place of not knowing as a teacher and just being OK with that. And the friend likes to ask the question, are you a boy or a girl? And Nash answers, I'm just a kid. They can be boys or girls. Yeah. Yeah. It was just like, non-binary, yeah. That's just something that we know. And this is something... I mean it's like they're four and five years old, and they just didn't make a big deal out of being a boy or a girl. And I think it was a huge testament to how much we've been talking about it in the classroom that you never mentioned the term non-binary. It was a child who brought that up because it's constantly in conversation. Yeah, just like me. So Nash just like me, is non-binary. So they aren't sure if they're a boy or girl. So when people ask them, are you a boy or a girl? Right now they just feel like saying, I'm a kid. They're figuring it out. They like stars. Yeah. And they aren't really... They wear their star shirt because it's their favorite shirt. And because they were nervous today, they thought they would wear something that makes them feel special. I think you just come up with the idea right away and I like that you're trying to think of, oh, what do they like, and so they can have the connection between each other. This weekend, their family is going to plant their garden. They're going to start working on their garden. They picked out three different types of sunflowers to grow in their garden. Huckleberries, have you ever seen sunflowers before? Yeah? Rowin, have you seen sunflowers before? No. No? Oh, you did? Emma, do you have a question? I feel like Emma still have the idea like not very sure about it, and I'm surprised that she actually... she really wants to ask you about why. I feel like that could be a topic that we should come back with. Why does Nash say they're just a kid? Right now, they don't feel like a boy. They don't feel like a girl. And that's OK. Not everyone is a boy or a girl. You're right. Not everyone is a grandma either. Yeah. Starting from the very youngest classroom, something that we really think deeply about with the children is fairness. So what is fair? What is not fair, and what can we do about it? How can we make change, not just something in our classroom, but something that we collaborate with other classrooms. We collaborate with our neighborhood on. I had a group of children who were building with the Magna-Tiles in the classroom, and I was listening. I came up close to them, and they told me that they were making a jail for homeless people. And so that propelled a whole discussion on people without homes. And we brought in a parent who was formerly homeless, a parent that had a child at the school. And she talked about what she wanted the children to know about herself and other families who were homeless. We brought in people who worked for the city. After this very long, probably a two-month project, the children started playing with the bigger blocks to build homes that were more soft, and they had pillows, and they had blankets. Their play had changed, and the environment provided those kinds of resources for them. OK, everyone, listen closely. So if you want to do this... And what's that trick called? It called... The wiggle. Well, because you're wiggling on the board. Well let her name it, it's her trick. We do encourage them to speak up for themselves. We're giving them and we're modeling for them. Stick up for yourself. Don't let anyone push you around. You don't like it? Then that's what you need to tell them. Give them... that's what you got a voice for. Use it. Stand up even if it's you, or if you see someone being mean to me or rude to me, say something to them. What if we had a friend at our school that was in a wheelchair, could they get on the balance board? Indefinitely, no. Why not? Because it would be... because the wheelchair would make it hard to stay on. Oh, so how could we make it so that they could play with us, too. How could we... Oh, we make a square one as big as the wheelchair on... From when I grew up and in the way I grew up, I probably would have got in trouble for asking or pointing to something and asking about it. Like even just something as simple as somebody being in a wheelchair, we would get shushed. So what you're saying is we can make one of these big enough to put the wheelchair on. And then we glue it onto there. And then the person who had the hurt leg gets to go on the wheelchair, and then it can spin. Wow, well that's a good idea to make one big enough. What do you think, Finn? If we had a friend in a wheelchair, how could we make it so that they could be on a balance board, too? Oh, we could take off their wheels and make like... Their answers came so quickly, and it was like maybe while I was talking to Zara, Finn was thinking about it. But when they brought up building a platform to put the wheelchair on, and then one of them said something about stairs. And I was like, but if you're in a wheelchair, how can you get up stairs? And then Finn comes up with this idea about the ramp and just pushing them up the ramp. Climb up the staircase. Zara, if they're in a wheelchair, how can they go up the stairs? Maybe we can go crutches. Crutches. That could be good for him to get on. Ramp Yeah. Yeah? Well... OK, wait. ...how can we get up the ramp? How could we get up the ramp? For them to figure out a way for somebody who couldn't do what they could do with their legs, but even if there was the challenge of the wheelchair, they figured out a way that, hey, this person can play, too. Yeah. So he can go up the ramp, and then you're going to sit on and do lots of tricks. Finn, I really like your drawing. Thanks. The invention that you told me about for the wheelchair, do you think you could make a picture to show me? What it would look like, the platform? The wheelchair goes up, up, up. The chair's the platform that can move around. So and they move around on it, and someone breaks off the ramp. They're pretty thoughtful and empathetic. And the way they just came up with those ideas was like, oh, yeah, they can do it, too. It was not about, well, they just can't do it. That never came up. Our question today is when have you ever experienced or seen something be unfair? That's what we're going to think about while we read our book, OK? So the reason behind choosing the book was something that was happening in the class and incorporating into a lesson, that we can have the kids notice it. Maybe if they're doing it, they're not noticing it. But if they're having a story read or having teachers acting out something, they can catch it more. Blue was a quiet color. Red was a hothead, and he liked to pick on blue. Red is hot, and blue is not. Do you think that's mean? Those words that Red said made him feel... Sad. We've been talking about these topics for many months now, about how we can be fair in our community and how we can respect each other's feelings. Green, Purple, and Orange, thought Blue was nice, too. But they never told Red to stop either. Asher says maybe they should say, stop, together. Max said Red isn't being kind, or maybe they should say, sorry. Maybe your feelings will be heard, and you don't want to play with the friend, right? It will break their heart apart if they walk away? Yeah. That's why we use our words? Yeah. Bringing in the book can help them reflect on things that are happening in the class. Sometimes it just takes one person to stop something from happening. I love this book, too. It's so awesome. Highlighting some important words in the book, exclusion and fairness, they can also start to use those words and speak up for themselves when they find something that isn't fair. What if I... Teacher Karla wanted to play with me in the home area, and I said, no, Teacher Karla. I don't want you to play with me because you have the color gray on. Like me and Max can play together because we have similar colors, so they should only me and Max play together... We had given an example of, if it would be fair to only play with students that have the same color as you. Maybe. Maybe if we were all wearing blue, then I would only play with friends that have blue, is that OK? Should I say you can't play with me because you have green. Is that fair on unfair? Unfair. They notice all their differences, so it's fun to have the conversations about what makes them different. The different skin colors, their different eye colors, textures in their hair. They'll start to talk about it and understand that not everyone is the same, and everyone is different and unique in their own way. While you're playing, it's not fair to exclude our friends based on what they're wearing, what color their hair is, or other things, right? Why not, Reid? They'll get sad. Is your skin color important? Yeah, it's important. One of the students did point out skin color so that we could have that open conversation without us having to say explicitly to them. They brought it up themselves organically. Yeah. Yeah, because that's being fair, right? Because you're excluding others, right, Max? Right, Max. Just like in our book, one of the colors decided to stand up for the friends and say stop. No more being unfair, so we're going to think of ideas... I'm going to talk to him after, OK? We're going to think of a time when something was unfair at our table groups, OK? And you're going to draw it. And when you're done, me, Teacher Jamie, and Teacher Karla are going to write what you said down. And we're going to be like the number one, and think of a way that we can make the situation better and fair. But that's just the kind of conversations that we have with these kids everyday that it just amazes me because they're four and five years old. And you know who expects a four- and five-year-old to be bringing up stuff like this? Not us. And it's like in the times that we're living in, it's good that they're bringing it up. I mean they're noticing it when they're little babies. But now, they're noticing it and they're voicing it. They're talking about it. So, yeah, let's talk about it. And what can we do about it if we see something unfair happening. So what can we do about it? What's in my busy box? Shake-a, shake-a. Finding the right balance between bringing up a topic, bringing up something that has happened versus waiting for the children to bring it up, I often think, what is the right way? What should we do? Really? What is it? A book. A book. I got this one from my home collection. I was really thinking a lot about George Floyd and his murder, and I wondered if the children would know about it. I wondered if they were going to bring it up. And I also wondered, should we bring it up? Should we be proactive? What should we do? So I called Brian, and we had some dialogue about next steps. When Nadia called me, I was actually thinking about setting up my classroom. I had not thought about how the children might be digesting this information and what they might say and how the other teachers might react. Little did I know that a child would come in that first day of school, and at snack time, announced to all his peers his knowledge of George Floyd. I knew at that moment, oh, I know what he's going to say. I know what he's going to announce. Let me listen to him and just respond from my heart and my mind after I hear what he says. And he said to the children, did you hear what happened in Minnesota? A white cop killed a Black man, and people are angry. This man didn't do anything. This man was Black. Did you know I'm Black? I wanted to say, wait, hold on. I haven't talked to Brian yet. I'm not ready, but this is real life. This is young children. I needed to respond right away. So my response was to mirror back a lot of what he said and say, yes, this did happen. And yes, people are angry, people are protesting. I'm angry, too. And I told them, when I'm angry, I think about how can I help. What can I do? And I turn that back to them. What is something that we can do? What is something that our class can do together to help make this better? Let's think about that together. First thing I thought about is, OK, I need to tell the families what happened and to tell them how the children responded and to tell them how I responded. I need to explain to them why I responded in this way. I want to invite them to participate. How are you talking at home about this? Has it come up at home? Parents are putting a lot of trust in us as teachers, and so we want to do this right. We don't just have one family's child, so we have this big group of parents who have all these different ways of thinking about how they want to talk to their children about race. So we really are taking them into account. We also want them to know about what we're up to, what we are thinking. And so we are sharing things that we're using, books that we're reading. It's key to have this conversation go back and forth. It's so important in doing social justice work to have someone who is your sounding board, someone who has the same values, and is really committed to this work. So I look to Brian when I want to think with someone about, what should I do? This happened in my classroom. Here's how I responded. What do you think? So getting some honest feedback and getting some ideas for what can next steps be. Let's plan together. This one is called Enough. And then it tells you a little bit about what the book's about. So under here, it tells you, 20 protesters who changed America. So this is about 20 different people who did different things to help change things, to make things more fair in America. Does that remind you of anybody? Yes. He's one of the 20 people in this book who helped make change. San Francisco 49ers Football Team. Colin took a knee to support Black Lives Matter. This was his way of spreading the word and showing people that things are not fair right now. Things need to change. See how he's kneeling? It's called taking a knee. So while everybody was standing up singing a song to the flag, he knelt down to show people, I'm doing this to support Black Lives Matter. Yeah, in front of the... oh, check it out. Russell noticed that they're showing all those people. All those dots are people. The next day I had given them this... I called it homework because they enjoy being these big kids who are going to kindergarten soon. I gave them their homework. It was to think about, what can we do about it? What can we, as a group of five year olds together with your teachers, what can we do to help make this a better place for everybody, a more fair place? So they came back the next day, and one of the children said, we need to support Black Lives Matter. And we need to make signs, and we need to hang them up so that people know that Black Lives Matter, and it's so important. And it's like, great. Let's look to the children for the ideas. Tomorrow we'll get the paper, we'll get the paint. No, Nadia. This is really important work. We can't wait till tomorrow. We have to do it now. Yes, let's do it now. You're right, this is important work. It can't wait till tomorrow. And we started this journey on, well, what does that mean Black Lives Matter? And what can our role be in supporting this movement? We got sticks. We put the signs on the sticks, and we had a march around the school. And again, Nadia, it's not over. That's just in our school. That's just walking around our yard. We have to go in all the classrooms in our school and tell them how important Black Lives are. They need to put our signs up in their windows. I told them, well, let me check with our director, so we can make a plan on when that could happen. No, we should check with the director. Invite him to our morning meeting. OK, yes, let's invite her. You're right. So that was really important for me to really just take a step back and let them be the leaders in this. So I did invite our director. Belann came in, and she listened to their ideas about going to all the classrooms, too. They were calling it "spread the word." So she brought in our school's diversity statement and gave them a little bit of the history of the school that social justice has been something that the school has been committed to for a long time. And she suggested to them, what if you wrote something to show the other classrooms that explained why these signs are important and what it means. The next week, we're able to get everyone's word and craft it together into this statement that we would deliver to all the classrooms. This is our Black Lives Matter sign, and we have a Black Lives Matter statements. We hope you'll hang the sign up and help us spread the word. The word I'm talking about is Black Lives Matter. Peace out. So, Coyotes, thank you for all of your hard work. It's really inspirational. And we are also making some signs. And I can't wait to read your statement. This is amazing. You guys are doing very, very important work, and this is a very important message. Thanks, Coyotes. The Black Lives Matter movement is a group of people who want to make sure that people of all skin colors are treated fairly. Black Lives Matter means... It just really gave me so much hope that these children are such great leaders already. And I started calling them social justice leaders which really made them proud. But right now, Black Lives Matter because Black people are not being treated fairly, and that's not nice or respectful of people's feelings. We're setting the foundation for children to be advocates for themselves and for their communities. And nothing could be more important, especially in these days. And it's not something that we can gloss over or not think about. It's in our bones, and it's in my bones as a gay man. I have experienced prejudice and violence in the world. And so I want the world to be just place for all children and a fair place for all children and a safe place and a joyous place. And so those things go hand in hand with anti-bias work. We are like a rainbow. And a rainbow should have all skin colors. Don't treat people differently because of the color of their skin. We hope you can join us and put up a Black Lives Matter sign on your window for everyone to see. Love, the Coyotes. My social identity impacts my work everyday. I am a multiracial, cisgender, spiritually diverse person. I'm Pacific Islander. My dad is Chamorro which is indigenous people of Guam, and my mom is white. As a white cisgender woman... As a Black queer woman... As an Asian-American... African heritage, Jewish, bimale... As a disabled woman of color... As an Afro-indigenous coach, education leader, advocate and most importantly mother to two beautiful brown children... As a young child, I remember being the only Muslim, immigrant origin, non-white person who spoke a different language with her parents. As a Black Muslim woman, I faced extreme bias and seen how it's led to violence. We have been both the targets and upholders of racial injustice. I never heard stories or played with toys where people look like me. I didn't fit in that I was seemingly other because my skin color did not match the color of those around me. | experienced a lot of racism and bias when I went... started going to predominantly white schools. So I didn't have the tools to understand what was happening there. I really learned to internalize my oppression and superiority. Now as an educator and as a parent, I want all children to learn the value of diversity. I want all children to know that men, too, are nurturing and caring and loving, and that there is more than one way of being a quote unquote "man." And to help them to be curious and understanding about the world around them... To teach young children how to communicate their ideas in meaningful ways that have an impact on the well being of the community... Help them feel included, welcomed, safe, joyful, and most of all loved. To give them power back while helping build positive identity and giving them the tools to engage in this conversation and understanding how the world works... To actively combat racism, social injustice, and inequality... Creating a more just, empathetic society... a society that upholds basic human rights for every citizen... Because this is how they grow up to be inclusive, accepting members of their community...
