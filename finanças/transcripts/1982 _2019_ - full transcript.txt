. According to history, the very discovery of this archipelago is controversial. Baptized Virgin Islands by the Italians, Sebaldes by the Dutch, and Falklands by the British, they all battled over who first spotted the islands. Just like gods, they were destined to have multiple names. However, it was the French crown that first founded a settlement on the islands in 1763. They named them Iles Malouines, and as proof of their conquest built a military fort which was called Port Louis, in honor of Louis XV, “The Well-Loved.” In 1766, by paying an abundant sum, France handed sovereignty of the islands to Spain. The change of flag brought along, once again, new names. The port was identified as Nuestra Señora de la Soledad. The islands were labeled Malvinas. The Argentinian Independence Wars disrupted order once again. In desperate need of troops, Spain transferred the Puerto Soledad garrison to the mainland, so they could help defeat Buenos Aires insurgent government. In 1820, after declaring independence from the Spanish crown, the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata inherited the sovereignty over the islands. In 1829, the port was refunded over the Spanish and French vestiges. It was named Puerto Argentino, a denomination the country never gave up. The United Kingdom, which had previously challenged France and Spain over the overseas territory, charged again in 1831. By 1833, it had finally achieved its goal. In 1841, a new outpost was built by the British settlers. They named it Port Stanley. The islands were newly baptized the Falklands. Administrative tasks were run by the British crown. That is how things remained for the following 149 years. Until April 2nd, 1982. I am the Commander of the Landing Operation manned by Navy infantry and Argentine Army soldiers sailing on this ship. Our mission is to land on the Malvinas Islands and oust the British military and authorities currently there. That's what we will do! Fate has chosen us to be the ones to remedy almost 150 years of usurpation. Out on the balcony! On the balcony! On the balcony! The balcony! And now we see that His Excellency the President has come out though not onto the balcony, but through the door of the House of Government, to greet the people. Cheering "Argentina, Argentina" in never-ending chants. There was direct contact, the President walked close to the crowd of people who cheer him and our armed forces recognizing this historical action of these past few hours. And right now, His Excellency, the President of our Nation, Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri. It's impressive, to hear the people cheering "Argentina, Argentina, Argentina!" Today, the whole of Argentina is in full agreement: The Malvinas Islands are ours. The President is waving his hand to greet the people, each and everyone in Argentina. Galtieri, Galtieri, Galtieri! Jump or you're a Brit! Jump or you're a Brit! It's impressive to hear them cheering and it's so moving, so huge. It's been so long since we last saw Argentineans this united, the way we should all be, the way we should always be. The people continue to cheer and shout! "Argentina, Argentina", chanting: "A people united is never defeated", That is true, so true! Everyone's got their eyes wet. Argentina, Argentina, Argentina! This day puts an end to 150 years of British occupation. April, 2nd, 1982 We'll be back! We'll be back! APRIL We received new information, from Brussels, where the European Economic Community is located. This is their report: The conflict between Argentina and Britain is the Number 1 topic on radio stations and TV channels and the main focus of all those commenting on politics, making headlines. Poland, Afghanistan, the economic crisis, the millions with no jobs in Europe, the ups and downs of the European Economic Community, and the Sinai, come second, think of that... second to the Malvinas and the threat of military confrontation. They could not film anything, they had four tapes, but got nothing at all. The others will go to their children but they'll come back to the Square. Those inside the House of Government can hear the people outside, shouting and cheering "Argentina". We want all of our Republic to see these images. A poster reading: Stop British thieves. End usurpation. Today, 28 million Argentineans will defend our sovereignty over Malvinas Islands, with our own lives. The Malvinas belong to Argentina! Long live Argentina! I believe this is an accurate definition of what we want to hear. Long live Argentina! That's the spirit on this square Plaza de Mayo. -Back to you. -And by your side, General. Thank you and the whole team here, on these stressful days so joyful on one hand, so tense on the other but we're working hard non-stop. I thank you, as I know you are representing, the public opinion of Argentina. You truly represent them. No disagreement I believe, about what's ours, about what belongs to our Nation. With Great Britain's authorities, their kingdom, their Prime Minister, and take back, what belongs to us, with the Argentine armed forces, who represent and are one with our people. Gentlemen, thank you, thank you, for being here. They come in waves from the mainland in waves, with soldiers and the supplies soldiers might need, we're documenting reality, a documentary produced by "60 minutes" for all of Argentina, and for whoever wants to see this abroad. That adult already prepared to be the adult he wants to be. He gets bigger and richer, as troops continue to arrive in waves, you can see them, coming to our Malvinas. They come with sophisticated means, to fulfill an ancient duty, gaining ground and strength on the land. Instructors, permanently there as new ones arrive and together, they think of their families and read letters from loved ones, waiting, ready to fight if necessary. Came from every corner in our country. They bring their own local songs, and the lyrics seem to blend into one single word spoken by all on this land so recently reconquered, where there's so little sunshine but so much joy, that's what the soldiers, all ready, speak of: faith in victory. Take a look, it's not army barracks but the agricultural society, that's been lent to us, upon our requirement, to give these kids the chance of doing this. It's not usual army routine, or the way private companies do it, nor what we do in military organizations. All we did is give them, these kids (le quité a place) and not just the kids, but adults as well, a chance to help (le sacaría but adults as well) we've given them the army's organization capacity, now look, you see this boy, a boy scout heading a line, he's 13, 14. In fact, he's a young boy, and what is he doing, General? He's head of this line. Coffee and milk with sugar, instant, for one. This is for breakfast, there's another one for teatime. We gave canned meat. There are two cans, for lunch and supper, and there are other things too: a bar of chocolate, cigarettes... also some jam... To their mums and sweethearts I say, I've been so many years serving in the army I know, their first concern is they are not injured and it's natural of course, but I don't even think of it as they will be back, with the flag of victory. They're already getting it, already getting that flag. And then, there's the worry: "Will they be cold?" "Will they be hungry?" It is my responsibility to see to that. So if they're cold or go hungry, you know who is to blame. I can assure that they won't be cold for they've got lots of warm clothing, and they'll come back a bit fatter, for food is better than back home. Also, for sure, in every box they receive, along with this ration, they'll find the affection and love for their country, from those who won't be in the battlefield, but still remain here, helping for they, too, are Argentineans. This message is inside every box: The volunteers, men and women, of all ages, who pack these rations, we all of us feel we are your brothers and sisters in this fight for justice. A fight to victory! Long live Argentina! Let all soldiers rest assured, there's deep affection behind all of this, and heartfelt support, a spontaneous action on the part of citizens who want to help regardless of the effort it takes, and know we are with you, even though it's not in the way we'd want to be, right there, beside you. It works the same way in every single location, whether here, or wherever rations are being packed for our soldiers, those fighting for our Malvinas Islands over there, in our far south. What these boxes contain is indispensable to survival, there's food here, though there is also another indispensable thing, for winning: the love and agreement of all Argentineans on this endeavour that's begun and will inevitably end with the victory of the Argentine Republic. A new image here in the islands, that of Argentine soldiers walking its streets, and another one, an old one, showing that, at least for now, there's calm and peace here. Kelper children, Malvinean kids are playing, carefree. A young woman, born here on the Malvinas, is studying in Buenos Aires, so she can go back soon and do so much. Dorcas, such a nice name, what does it mean? It's a Greek name, it means gazelle. How do you think you will help your pupils in Puerto Argentino? I believe it will be hard at first, because the school system is very different in Argentina, when compared to what they were used to. So we will have to go slowly, to change the way teachers work there. Though once they get used to it, it will be much easier. It's a more formal way of teaching. And the language, the history of Argentina, they've never studied it. I'm planning to go back when I graduate, next year for sure. I'll go back as soon as I can, to work as a teacher. We will all be looking forward to that moment. And we thank you so much. Thank you. YOU CAN HELP WIN THE WAR Adult people need to be told the truth at all times, so our authorities are informing you the truth. Argentineans, we shall win! We are all here, expecting Alexander Haig, who'll arrive very soon, Long live Argentina! And let him hear us, so shout it out loud. In a few minutes, like we said, Alexander Haig is arriving in Argentina, surrounded by Air Force officers, and US Embassy officials, all calmly smiling and waiting, expecting General Haig. And here he comes, and comes towards the microphone, to say: "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, as you all know, President Reagan asked me to personally represent him as you know Argentina and the United States are hemispheric partners with many years of close cooperation, that relationship has grown to be even more cordial in recent times and remains on an excellent basis even in this conflict. Tomorrow I'll have important discussions with your President. People come with their children, there are elderly and young people, this is, obviously, how the Argentine people respond. What do you do? Still studying to become a physical education teacher. What are your abilities to contribute to our armed forces? Well, perhaps I could assist nurses, or do whatever they need. Are you trained to help nurses? No. But you do want so much to help and serve our country. Yes. Yes, above all. Well, as an Argentinean I think, what I can do... I'm here because I want to fight, I am a man of action. We say it proudly, Argentinean women are now also ready, and here. These volunteers in Argentina are willing to go to the battlefield and help backstage. Any training to assist or work in hospitals, helping? Right now I'm volunteering for my country, training these volunteers, I thought of coming to train them. I realize Argentinean women were potential volunteers who are now active. In any hospital a volunteer is someone who wants to help, that's the definition. Will, a strong will and lots of love and very especially in times of emergency like these, volunteers need to know first of all that they must obey orders, even if they are highly qualified, if they are volunteers they need to be willing to serve and obey orders. General Menéndez, have social and economic measures taken to this date, contributed or shown an influence on islanders? I'd say a number of things have had an influence or shown results, not sure about coming closer, which is what we really seek, for in such a situation, let's talk about sovereignty, it's a fact and final in our opinion, but for them, still listening to the BBC and all, it's still a question, if it's not perfectly defined, so there will be some difficulties to make good contact with them. However, I'd like to point out, we received, in addition to the setting up of the color TV station, and this is so important to us, we received TV sets from the mainland, donated by Argentine companies. Our first decision was to send some of these TV sets, to organizations working for the common good, and the people, these men who are important in their community were thankful, and will be placing them in the halls of buildings where people get together, so they could start watching TV. I believe this can have a very positive effect as long as we structure and work in order to plan intelligently, the programming of our color TV. What do you think about this situation? -I think it is a big mess, -Why? It has completely upset our lives. We are old people. We've lived in peace all of our lives, we hope to finish our lives, the way we've lived. Do you think that will change? Absolutely, I'm sure of it... -Well, it is a different way of life. -Thank you very much, sir. How old are you? 19. What did you feel when coming to fight here? To be honest, a mix of pride and fear, you know? -Both, pride and fear. -Yes. What do you think will happen? Right now... nothing... I'm not thinking any more. Nothing's going to happen. They are ours. -Thank you. -You're welcome. How have the Argentine military treated you? Very well. Did they give you cigarrettes, reading material, food enough? Are you absolutely satisfied? How long have you been in jail? Since February 27th. For what reason? Had too much to drink. When will you leave jail? Tomorrow. This is one of the most longed-for moments on the Malvinas Islands, more specifically here, at the airport. The time newspapers arrive, and of course, they're gone in the blink of an eye. As both you and we know, the world is watching us, so it is essential to make a clear, genuine statement. Vice-Commodore Correa, here we are, at the lighthouse of the Malvinas Islands, and that's the sea the British fleet is sailing towards this place. What chances does that fleet have of landing here? Well, it's got the same chances any other force would have when they intend to recover something that doesn't belong to them and here we are, all ready to defend our land. And that sea, out there it's ours, and we're firmly set on fighting for it and die if we have to. I come from the province of Chaco, based in Corrientes, during my time as a conscript. Have you just arrived? No. We arrived yesterday afternoon. So you are here since then? Do you know where you'll be sent? Maybe to the Greater Malvina, we don't know too much, we heard we might be going to the Greater Malvina. Is this what you imagined it to be? It is, based on what we knew, we imagined it to be cold, inhospitable climate we're here to defend our country. So, how do you all feel? What do you expect will happen? First of all, we want this whole thing to be settled in a peaceful way, though if we have to fight for our Malvinas, rest assured we will fight. We definitely know that in every corner of our country, there are young people watching this right now, and we also know these young people don't need to be pampered, so we choose not to show what we are feeling, though we do want to say we are proud of these gentlemen who are but 18 years old, and sometimes need to think smart to survive in Malvinas. See this: It is so cold we can hardly speak, our jaws are frozen, however, it doesn't seem to affect these soldiers too much or at least, it doesn't keep them from working or feeling fine for they're all in a good mood. They are setting up their shelters, getting ready for the night. How would you define the morale of the British on this island? The morale of the British on this island was not good. How can you tell? I can tell because of the life they led in the barracks. They had all kinds of comfortable things, and there were a number of items that revealed they were not perfectly fit for combat even though they were well equipped to do so. Soldiers must live in austerity, surroundings must be simple and never filled with luxury, that's a principle. Any drugs? We haven't found any drugs. However, why would 120 armed men not defend themselves the way they could have? So, well, when a group of soldiers does not defend a place it's because they don't love it. Did you warn them about what would happen if they return? Well... I said the armed forces of Argentina will defend these islands with our own lives, fighting hard. And that whoever sets foot on our land, even for a visit, should know that if something happens at that time they'll need to be ready to fight even if it means losing their lives... Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel. The President is now about to board Tango 01 to fly to Comodoro Rivadavia. And now, the crew welcomes our President aboard Tango 01 for immediate departure. It's 5:45 pm, we hear the noise of jet engines, as the airplane is ready and starts moving, take-off signalling now. General Galtieri, Mr. President, we are now overflying a good part of our country and arriving in Comodoro, a stopover, before flying to Malvinas. A lifetime dream come true? I believe it is the lifetime dream of many generations of Argentineans, and not just mine. Our Tango 01, the presidential aircraft, with the Chief of the Army is about to land in our Malvinas. Now you see the blue car bringing the Chief of the Army who looks out, just a few meters from us, filled with wonder, by this geography Argentineans rediscovered. All of this is ours, once again. The Malvinas are ready for a war, for our country is ready, all around us, we notice it this vast wilderness always so windy will be turned into fertile land, by our future generations. The first visit of Gral. Galtieri to the Malvinas. Sergeant, how are the kids doing? Very well, good, in high spirits. A tremendous will and teamwork, so enthusiastic about our goals. About this very chance. No second thoughts? Not at all, but rather the opposite. More determined by the day. And our own Diego Maradona, Diego's never been loved as much as today, on the one hand because he represents the boys we are at heart, the typical kid from Buenos Aires, though here he is a symbol of those mysterious things that make us Argentineans relate to one another, the definition of a nation. There were porn photos on the wall they are gone, now Diego Maradona took their place, and there's Gardel, and these faces, here I don't want you to forget them. Just some of the thousands of soldiers who built this country for you, and for me... just common people, regular men like those walking the streets of our cities, every day, obviously the kind of people who crossed the Andes with San Martín. MAY THE FIRST ATTACK 08.23 am and this is a new attack on Puerto Argentino, so much fiercer now, before, just two bombers attacked the airport didn't succeed. And now shooting grew in intensity, and you see the target is the Argentine merchant ship in the bay. Sounds like fireworks. There's the attacking bomber, flying by, disappearing rightwards! Another bomber! It's flown by, now! Our missiles go right towards enemy targets. Soldiers run across the street, ready to take position. Father Fernández, where are you going? Going to the hospital, just in case there is a need but we're calm and confident, so be calm and confident, it is our nation, our Argentina, and we know what we're doing so here, though there's a natural worry, know that we are all doing our duty. -That's right, Father! -See you soon. In this vehicle, Captain Gafoglio's we are going right to the airport, to see what happened, on site. Finally, at 8:52 am, we got to the airport half an hour after the bombers' attack and this is what our eyes see as we reach the runway, we can say for sure that in spite of appearances, neither the runway nor the platform covered with dirt, were affected and you see our national flag and it's proudly swelling in the swirling smoke, untouched. Alert is light blue, this means at least half an hour of calm and peace, before a potential attack, and soldiers are resting. Eating some chocolate, the army chaplain is with them, and they're sort of relaxing after so much stress and tension. You can still hear explosions probably gas tanks, exploding now. Second Lieutenant Sánchez, I know it's too soon, no certainty, but how many of our enemy have been killed until now? Seems to have been three; two with missiles, and one probably with anti-aircraft cannons. Were they Sea Harriers? Yes, Sea Harriers. -With helicopters as well? -No, just them. What do you feel, having shot down an English aircraft? I feel we are going to shoot down many more of those. Thank you, and good luck. Hope it comes true. Thanks. You are watching the most dramatic testimony in contemporary Argentine history. English aggression and national forces defending the land we have recovered. You are doing something else... We protested before the United Nations early on in this conflict, some 6 thousand people were with us, we also protested before the Organization of American States, in Washington with more than 2 thousand coming from New York. We also distributed news by Telam News Agency in Argentinean stores, and gave them slates. You've been collecting money, so how can people donate? As a rule, we... tell people that instead of sending goods to Argentina like clothing, medicine, or blood we'd rather have them... give money transferring to a special account with Banco Nación, that's the Patriots' Fund for Malvinas Argentinas and we're also telling people to please join in the Latin American boycott against a number of British products, and in all of the US. Emergency, dear Argentineans and Latin Americans please join in the boycott against English products. Don't buy, and there's a list. Thank you for this brief summary, I know all of you want to say something, you are all Argentineans... To the death! I feel I'm an Argentinean. There are people from other countries in this continent. Yes, sir. I'm from Costa Rica. Central America, This cause is ours, too. A Latin American cause. Not just Argentinean. Because it's about a powerful country from a different continent wanting to invade this land. -Where are you from, Madam? -From Guana. All my best wishes for Argentina because I love them so much. Long live Argentina! Down with the Brits! His Excellency, the President of Argentina will speak to our people. Today, they have repelled a new act of war by Great Britain in the South Atlantic. They have used and continue to use now, their fire power against us and we have responded and will respond in kind with fire, as we shall always do, if our enemy tries to once again turn our Argentine land into a colony. The bottling company of Buenos Aires, Crush S.A an Argentine company founded in 1926 are donating to the Patriots' Fund of Malvinas Argentinas 10% of sales of Crush Orange as of today, until May 31st. The team of Argentina Television has traveled over there and were overflying Puerto Darwin. DARWIN, MAY 1st The attack against Puerto Argentino had been reported. And we needed to confirm the extent to which British colonialist forces had succeeded in their goals. These images are not perfect, for they are raw battle footage, but they document history. The typical topography of the Malvinas Islands makes observation easy, fast covering the whole region, every meter, every place, as we overfly the area, an area defended by professionals, and above all, by patriotic men of Argentina. Those men of ours who are always alert and who defend our sovereignty. Today, at the River stadium, Argentina - URSS. So there we go. A music band we usually find it hard to identify, has come to play some marches and then, the national anthems of the nations represented by the teams in this match. This is the first time, I say, I see a standing ovation in recognition of a military band. Upon hearing the first few bars of a military march, usually by the bands belonging to our country's armed forces, this stadium seemed to explode. As if the Argentine team had come out onto the field, or rather, as if they'd won the World Cup. I believe this is quite a symbol of union of Argentineans watching a sports match, at a stadium, but it's also the union of a heartbeat resonating with those who are right now defending our country. I wonder if you've felt, helpless, anxious, anguished, upon seeing what is going on and happening to all of us, though of course, the main characters here are all those men, in our armed forces. That is the reason of this chance we have to share with you, these 24 consecutive hours as of this moment. 24 hours in which what matters the most... is that you'll be setting records, because it's 24 hours of solidarity reflected in the Malvinas Argentinas Patriotic Fund. The only way to show this is by making a contribution. We will be using many of the sets at Argentina Televisora Color, and all of the mobile units of Argentina Televisora Color. There are 45 land lines here. And at the other end of these 45 phone lines, there is a patriot that will be answering your call. The reasons for these phones are more than just one. You can make cash contributions. ON WE GO, ARGENTINA! 24 HOURS FOR MALVINAS Argentineans, we shall win! Members of our audience at home, please, stand up now. All of you, stand up and sing our national anthem. The free peoples of the world respond to the great Argentina: Long live! Hear mortals, the sacred cry: Liberty, liberty, liberty! Or swear to die with glory! Or swear to die with glory! Or swear to die with glory! Argentina! Argentina! We have every sophisticated weapon, though we also have that tremendous strength that's shown in this way, see, this is the most powerful weapon. It is two thousand years old. Holy Spirit, Amen. May the Lord be with you. And with your spirit. May Almighty God, have mercy on us and forgive us our sins and give us eternal life. The young chaplain admitting this is his first mass in Malvinas, and experiencing the emotion of those first ones, in truth now, we Argentineans need to be adults for once, willing, to be historically adults. These are the soldiers who kneel only before God. These young men, now fully and definitely men, who are, as you see, ready for definitely important things. FUNERAL OF THE ENGLISH PILOT And the words of the Lord, The remains of an English pilot. In the course of his duties in the total exclusion zone, LONDON around the islands, HMS 42 Sheffield destroyer was detected and reached by an Argentine missile. The ship caught fire which spread out of control. When there was no hope of saving the ship the crew decided to abandon it, and all who abandoned it were picked up. BRITISH MINISTRY OF DEFENCE What did you feel upon hearing about the destruction of the Sheffield? I was deeply shocked, I still have hope of there being a pacific solution. It would be nice for it to be solved by means of diplomacy. I think it is a reasonable solution. I rather expected it to happen. It was inevitable, for if you have missiles on board it's obvious you'll be attacked. It was predictable. I feel so sad. Can you tell me how you feel about the news of the Sheffield destroyer? It is a waste. Don't know much of these things, but there should be a way for diplomats to find a solution, so I believe negotiations should be the way out. Of course, these are all images of melancholy, coming from the Great Britain of today and the result of recklesness on the part of Mrs. Thatcher. What happens is the empire is falling to pieces and its definitive decline happens in the South Atlantic. To victory! You hear applause now, because here, in the sets of Argentina Televisora Color His Excellency, the Foreign Minister of Argentina is coming in, Dr. Nicanor Costa Méndez, who came spontaneously... Because our country asks for our all. Argentina! Argentina! Argentina! Above all, I want to talk about the thrill of being here with all of you. To experience this Argentine feeling revealing something important, truly important and that is the Malvinas cause that is the cause of our nation, the cause of Malvinas is the cause of Argentina. The cause of all the generations of Argentina since 1833, and the cause of those generations that will follow and thank us for having recovered our national heritage... this whole generation, our dear islands. And there is more, for the cause of Argentina is becoming the cause of America and the world is amazed as it will become the cause of those in the whole world, who in one way or another, have suffered injustice. You said you had only a few minutes, but have stayed longer, than you announced earlier. Thank you, both for this great effort, your sacrifice... Don't talk of sacrifice, because that makes us feel so bad because on an occasion such as this... Let's say "contribution" then. -Yes, that's right. -A contribution, yes, so you could meet someone who lent a hand like so many others who've lent a hand and that is none other than the lady out there, just a regular woman... Who has deeply moved me. Who does not really know where her husband is. Never heard of him, he was on board the General Belgrano. That simplicity, strength, willpower only possible at times such as these, she has brought her fur coat so we can auction it and collect more money for the Malvinas Argentinas Patriotic Fund. This is the lady, just a regular woman. So on we go, towards victory. In peace, and justice, you are so extraordinary at times such as these... Faithful, to all. Can I say something before you go? God bless you. Thank you very much. Argentina, Argentina, Argentina! Ladies and gentlemen, this is how we say goodbye to Dr. Nicanor Costa Méndez, our Foreign Minister, briefly with us. The Joint General Staff of the Armed Forces announces that today, at 1.40 PM, English forces have attacked Puerto Argentino on the Malvinas Islands, and that our forces are responding with fire. MALVINAS MILITARY AIR BASE We are now close to the airport, some 150 mt. from the runway where there's another crater. Like we said, this one is deeper, close to the YPF plant that's right behind us. Commodore, how come they missed once again? Well, I believe it's not for me to say, but there's anxiety, with close anti-aircraft fire... and this affects the natural situation of the pilot, I can tell you that. And the attack was close, the plane was flying low, maximum protection self-defence, makes it hard for the pilot to hit the target. One of the many cluster bomblets, we find here, at around the airport. This one is special because the wind played a game here, and attached to it a letter dated in Daireaux we read, "Sunday, April 18, 1982" and it is addressed to: "Dear brother, I'm just sending a few...", that's all we can read because we cannot touch the bomb, as it could go off any minute. Even so, in our minds it becomes a symbol. A letter, written with love for a brother and seemingly stopping a bomb. Now that, once again, we are defending ourselves your contribution to the Patriotic Fund is indispensable. so right now is your chance, to walk out of your house, and find one of our kitties, or you may come up to Argentina Televisora Color, do something that'll cause you to feel good about yourself, that will help our country. Is it true it is one of your favorites? It is. Because I painted it during a very hard time in my life, going through a rough patch, so I asked God for help, and that's how "The procession" was born. You will notice the background is red, deep red, a symbol for our world in conflict and from below that world, there emerges a pure, white church a symbol of our Lord, that's why I named it "The procession". I knew it was one of Jorge's favorite paintings, and I knew that donating it was such a meaningful thing for him, giving it to be auctioned, this highly successful auction that has not ended yet because the 24 hours are not up.... We cannot tell if Jorge Porcel's painting will be fetching a higher amount of money. In truth, I repeat, I have always been proud of being Argentinean and at this time I feel even prouder... I can see so many dear faces, so understand why I'm blowing kisses... I was saying I'm proud, and I take pride as well, in the people of my own calling, the actors, the actresses... the world of art, the many Argentineans, the mothers, those mothers with their sons in the battlefield. As a mother, I cannot forget there are young men out there, dying for us. They are making history, and are giving their lives for us, and I also want to say that a few days ago, I spoke to a high official in our country, and offered to go to Malvinas during this war. If my being there can be a good thing for all those soldiers who are fighting on the islands, then I will be very happy to be there. I have made a commitment, a passionate one, made a promise to our government... The time has come to give ...all the cement that might be necessary to make our Malvinas a part of our territory, a province of Argentina. Bravo! I mean, whatever is needed to build roads, and hospitals, and highways, because you know that the province of Malvinas, is isolated, practically isolated, and it has only its harbors, and its houses. It is not just my commitment, but that of other industries in the cement sector, who support me, and that's what we will do one day, I hope that day comes very soon, when we will reach Malvinas, and be able to give its inhabitants, always regarded as second-class, to give them the idea of what it is like to live as Argentineans. Over there we can see the old British hospital. And opposite the hospital, the house of the governor with our flag, The hospital is only for civilians, however, here you can see the military hospital, set up in just 48 hours, by our personnel. That is where our injured are treated after enemy bullets hit them, they were flown here by helicopter. It is unusual to have the chance of having so many World Cup champions in a single place, and of welcoming them, to our family, because this has become a family after being together, for so many hours to make this idea come true. Well, this is our way of making a contribution to the Patriotic Fund, and the members of the National Soccer Team are donating $A 100 million... and... 100 million new Argentine pesos to the Patriotic Fund, donated by the National Soccer Team. Please hand the microphone to Maradona. Well, I think there's nothing to add, I came with them, and I'm sure those in the pre-match meeting at the hotel would have come, too because this is so very special, this show touched my heart yesterday. Saw people bringing so many things, very valuable things... things they love so much, I believe that if we were all asked to give our lives, we would do so. Thank you, Diego. Here you can easily identify and see a Hércules C-130 of the Argentine Air Force, reaching the Puerto Argentino base, in our Malvinas Islands. It's on a humanitarian misión, to carry the injured to the mainland, to be treated. There are men, ready to serve others, and men who receive their help, old comrades, together again. There are also men who come and treat or help everyone who might be in need, as the battle goes on. Argentine soldiers who do not hesitate and give all they are as Argentine soldiers, to defend our sovereignty, the integrality of the territory belonging to Argentineans, the huge back door of the Hercules is open, to give help and receive love. Our men, our reporters, are also shaking hands, with those heading this operation. Immediate circumstances after the sly assault of colonialists, have forced them to be especially cautious in order to fly. Notice the take-off, is not typical, it's different, Why? To avoid radar detection. They need to avoid radars, even when carrying the injured. There goes the Hércules. The take-off manouvre was special, different. Watch closely, for the cameras bring you the best testimony of the many presents we have been receiving. All of these paintings, these works of art, these are all presents people have brought, to be auctioned, to collect funds for this crusade. "60 minutos" today chose to start in the place of our country we all love so much: Puerto Argentino, Malvinas Islands, where the historical May 25th celebrations had a special feeling. Happy National Day and good morning, Argentina! MALVINAS MILITARY AIR BASE PUERTO ARGENTINO MALVINAS ISLANDS MAY 25th COMMEMORATION 4:20 PM, two Sea Harriers fly across the sky, overflying Puerto Argentino, and our antiaircraft artillery is shooting. Watch the wakes, ahead of the projectiles and as they aim we can almost see they'll hit their target. They seem to be high enough to hit the target. People shouting "Bravo". However, both airplanes are still flying. We see them perfectly, two black dots, followed by the white wake as they fly at high speed. Another wake, later, another Harrier, overflying, and our artillery is already estimating how far it is from here. Is it worth shooting or not? And then, as calm seems to return for a while we can delight our eyes in the scenery of our Malvinas. Last night, the BBC in London commented on this show, broadcast in Argentina, we are now about to hear what the BBC said: Argentineans will be able to watch a 24-hour TV show, that will be broadcast non-stop with the intention of boosting their morale. "Boosting our morale" Argentineans have no need of morale boosting, or have we? Long live Argentina! Of course, when as a child you were told, that there were "pirates" or usurpers in the Malvinas Islands, those islands that are rightfully ours, in the South Atlantic, on our continental shelf, and we were not.... it's people who speak a different language, far away and who have no idea at all about these islands, or where they are, until the beginning of this conflicto. And when someone says, you know sometimes it's hard for me to keep quiet, when they says the Malvinas Islands are inhabited by English-speaking people who are regarded by England as second-rate citizens, they're known as Kelpers, because of the large seaweeds surrounding our Malvinas, yes, kelp, that's the seaweeds, whenever that's used as the basis for claiming non-existing rights and when you think the Argentineans on Malvinas were expelled by English invaders, and that's why Spanish is not the language there! That's why our people are not there. Perhaps, should be bring together those families so brutally expelled from there, if we gathered the remaining members, their children, grandchildren, great-granchildren, and beyond, then they would be so many more than 1,500. I mean... if the BBC in London says, Long live Argentina! if the BBC in London says, that what Fontana and I are doing here, is to "boost our morale", you know what? I couldn't care less about what the BBC in London says! All I care about is what you say! That's all I care about, what you say, you, at home, watching us, for hours, for such a long time, I care about these 24 hours and the money, lots of it, we'll collect because this morning we were attacked, once again. And money is necessary, money for weapons, money for defending ourselves, money for our homeland. Argentina! Argentina! Argentina! JUNE Once again, we repeat, for the whole country: This afternoon, at Fitz Roy, in Malvinas, an English frigate was sunk, a large landing ship, destroyed, a landing ship with intermittent fire a landing ship, full of smoke, and sailing away from us, all of them, English. Back in a moment. Beirut, satellite images, the invasion of south Lebanon, Spanish Ambassador: "Argentina is right", Buenos Aires and Luján get ready to welcome the Pope. Caracas, Venezuela, satellite communication ratifying solidarity. Another report from our special envoy. This, and more, in "60 minutos: the time of truth". A scene that's almost daily in Puerto Argentino needing no further description. We've often heard it said our morale is high and we sometimes wonder about the grounds for that statement. These images need no words. The intersection of Sarmiento and del Libertador Avenue, in the neighborhood of Palermo, Buenos Aires, work is being completed, on the monumental altar where the supreme pontiff is to officiate mass. A large infrastructure of amplifiers will cover the length of Sarmiento Ave. Here, the Pope will be meeting with the military junta, just as in Great Britain he met with the Queen. One of the soldiers was able to return from Darwin after the battle there, and he is now in Puerto Argentino. What was your mission, specifically? These two soldiers and I were members of an advance patrol. Our mission was secret, and that's all I can say. Our position was hidden, though we'd have to walk all night long. There was a blizzard and it snowed all day, which was good for us, because snow covered our bodies, our backs and heads, good for our camouflage... our most perfect camouflage and... -You could have frozen to death? -We could have frozen to death. The two soldiers with frostbite are doing all right now...xxx we walked until around 01:00 am and could not reach our position for we realized that it was an island but we tried to reach an approximate location, as close as possible, and buried ourselves in the snow, we could salvage our communications equipment, and weapons, whatever was of value to us... Soldier Morales. Salta. Soldier Coronel. Tucumán. Thank you so much. LET US WIN THE BATTLE ON EVERY FRONT My country needs me: what can I do for my country? Keep calm, don't buy more than you need, for that promotes speculation, do your duty as a mother, as a wife, as a girlfriend, a friend, as a sister, our country in action is the powerhouse for victory. Each one doing their duty, defending what's ours. Argentineans, towards victory! Now, the military governor of the Malvinas, Georgia, and South Sandwich Islands, General Mario Benjamín Menéndez, stated during a phone call early this afternoon with the President's Secretary, General Héctor Iglesias: "We've got soldiers made of steel, and with a brave heart", you're right, General. There you go, fuck! Load, come on! Come on, Sixth! Fire! Now! Well done, Correa, fuck! Well done, Correa! All of these sequences broadcast by the Argentine Television, and filmed right on the theater of war, show various angles of reality. The ceremony presided by Lt. Gen. Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri, when our national flag was lowered this afternoon, closing the main event on Reaffirmation Day of Argentine rights over the Malvinas, Georgia and South Sandwich Islands. The ceremony was replicated simultaneously in every provincial capital, cities and towns in our country. Those attending the ceremony, adhere to the President and make silence upon hearing the first bars of our national anthem. Oh swear to die with glory! Oh swear to die with glory! Bells tolling lend their sounds to the night and the people of our Republic tell our soldiers: "Here we are!" There are many moments of "60 minutos" also shown on England's TV, this means many of our reports by "60 Minutos" in Buenos Aires, Argentina, are aired in London, Great Britain. We pray to God this report is also shown in London, for it's about standards, and points, might come in handy for the English people to understand what it's all about. And here, we can see the Pope and we hear the warm welcome to Argentina. Vicar of Christ, messenger of peace, visiting a country. An apostolic journey outside of Italy. These images will forever remain in our memories. John Paul II We understand there's been no action on the warfront for hours so what's the morale of our military on the islands? During the whole day today we were on the frontline, where the combat took place and after being there we can conclude there is calm and peace now, sometimes, sporadically interrupted by British artillery but at least in the area where we were today they rather miss the shots also, we found out for ourselves that the food in Puerto Argentino, in spite of the distance, is truly good in both quantity and calories we saw it's more than enough. The morale is perfect, high. We could also see mail distributed, so soldiers in the frontline are always in touch with their dear ones. Letters reach them all right, I repeat, think of the distance from the frontline to Puerto Argentino. One of the teams of "60 minutos" and their mobile units are already in a hotel in Retiro, for a press conference with the Foreign Minister, getting everything ready, there are colleagues from around the world, sharing this with us, following news at all times... Our Foreign Minister is about to do what's to be done: give official news, on behalf of the Argentine government at this time of day, under these circumstances. News in so many capital cities of the world are repeated in other capital cities and are often distorted, for technical reasons or political reasons, some news are war propaganda, and this causes us sometimes unwillingly, to contribute to disorder, at least in terms of specific news. So the right thing is to listen to official news from our Foreign Minister, telling the country and the world what is really going on now. ...so that we can bravely bear witness of Christ to all men, He is the center of our cosmos and history, let's pray to the Lord, John Paul II, is the head of those called Holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen. Brothers, fighting in the world, for the sake of our faith. Something seems to be going on but we don't know what, war dogs of the Navy infantry barking madly, cannon fire now and then, a truck went by where we are, and was stopped by the guards in the Town Hall. We hear people shouting... with what purpose or intention? We'll find out soon, in the meantime here by the bay the fire is still blazing, very close to the governor's house. This is LRA 1 Radio Nacional, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Combat in Puerto Argentino has ceased. Our soldiers fought bravely with supreme effort for the dignity of our nation. They fought against those who will not understand, against contempt, against arrogancy. They fought with more courage than weapons against the overwhelming superiority of a powerful force supported by the military technology of the United States of America, amazingly, now enemies of Argentina and our people. Let us hide our pain, and hold our heads high, our people are strong and feel strong. Argentina, Argentina, Argentina! Sons of bitches! Sons of bitches! Murderers! Murderers! Murderers! Murderers! Sons of bitches! Sons of bitches! Murderers! Murderers! Murderers! Murderers! Sons of bitches! Sons of bitches! Sons of bitches! Sons of bitches! Step back! Step back! Prime Minister, could you have a word with us, please? Prime Minister[indistinct] I've got wonderful news and it's Great Britain’s. Marvelous forces, every single one of them. It's just been everyone together and that’s what matters. We knew what we had to do, we knew what we had to do. Do you think they're coming back home? I believe so. There’s still one or two things Isn't that incredible? I must go down... The armed conflict lasted for 74 days. Official records registered 907 deaths caused by the war. 649 of those deceased were Argentine soldiers. 255 were British soldiers. The remaining 3 were native civilians. According to different sources, there were between 2000 and 2500 wounded. The Argentine Center for Former Combatants of the Malvinas War (CECIM) estimates that between 350 and 450 Argentine veterans took their own lives after the conflict. SAMA (The South Atlantic Medal Association) counts up to 264 suicides among British citizens who returned from battle. Argentina surrendered on June 14th, 1982. Four days later, Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri resigned as the nation's president. After 8 years of military dictatorship, an agreement is reached to call for democratic elections. In 1986, Galtieri was condemned to 12 years in prison with charges of negligence during the war. He was pardoned in 1990, having served 4 years of his sentence. Margaret Thatcher served as Primer Minister of the United Kingdom until 1990, when she finally resigned. No other British chief executive in the 20th century held office for so long. In 2002, Galtieri was once again judged. This time for crimes against humanity. He dies in 2003. Margaret Thatcher dies in 2013 of a stroke. From a legal point of view, the United Nations Decolonization Committee determined that the islands are a non-autonomous territory with indeterminate sovereignty. 37 years after the war, the archipelago is still under British administration. Made good use of the morning but noon was wasted. Too bad, it's a great afternoon. On the jeep all the time, they gave us transportation, as a way of having us there. How come? A whole afternoon for a two-minute tape. They made us erase some material. Listen, you film whatever you want, tell me, and I'll do it. Seems to me when you calls come in, I thought you were a ghost... so many people can think you are a ghost... I'll wear a tie if you want me to. No, this way, take it easy, this is a war zone. Well, so my appearance is mute, sort of, right? That's right, you... Hey, want me to wear this so I look smarter? Such a hard worker, you... Nice headphones, original. Does the mate package show behind? Ok, I'll pretend I'm on air, and reading. It's been confirmed....
