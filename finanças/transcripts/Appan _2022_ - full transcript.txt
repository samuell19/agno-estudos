FATHER Oh Lord! Gas Is he finished? Of course, why don't you get ready for church? It was such a good dream That man was flat dead Why did you wake me up? To drink this slurry? Did you really see *Appan dead? *father Of course! With the cotton plugged in his nose... he looked so handsome But his eyes were still open We tried our best to close them but... no way They wouldn't close He was ogling the women who came to his funeral Were we all alive? Or was it just Appan? Noonju was the one who stuffed cotton in his nostrils He couldn't get enough of it So he kept pushing in more Hey, Noonju I heard some noise from there last night Is your Appan dead? Tell me, man That creep doesn't let us sleep at night I wonder how long we should put up with him When he was a young man... he used to go hunting He could eat a bison or boar in one go That's why he is still strong He used to have raw fat! I think I'll go away before he does Why didn't you give him coffee, *Ammachi? *mother So that he can wet the bed again? Give it to Noonju Even that boy is wetting the bed -How can we make it stop, Ammachi? -He is only a kid That one is an old bull He is doing it on purpose If we put a plastic sheet... the mattress won't be ruined What can we do if he says it's hot? Let him have fun lying down To hell with him! You go and help the child clean up He will fall sick if he lies on wet sheet -Shall I change Appan's sheet? -No Let him soak in his pee for sometime Enough! If you wet the bed again I'll make you wash the sheet You heard that? Go and get dressed Take the ones in the bottom drawer Be quiet, Luxy *Appapan is sleeping *grandfather -*Chettayi *respectful term for man -What? I want to go home for Christmas at any rate Every time my mother calls, she cries What can we do? We can't leave Ammachi alone with Appan So? We have missed many Christmas for this This time, whether Appan dies or not... I'm going home We will sort it out Come here after your chores We have to press sheets Careful Ammachi Hi Abel How are you? Have it Go on Is your bike second-hand? Molly How are you? Oh! Nothing much to speak of -Where is Chettayi? -He is over there -Where is the bell? -Appan took it out -Appan? -Sleeping -Molly -Chettayi, how are you? You came alone? Where is brother-in-law? He goes mad when I tell him I want to see Appan He won't come here until Appan is dead Remember how Appan swore at him that day Why is the bulb still on? Don't you need to pay the bill? That bulb never goes out It's just like our Appan The switch is broken Our electricity bill is so high -What about there? -Why are you still standing outside? Come in Oh my! -Look at you -Play elsewhere, kids You have become so thin and pale Doesn't anyone give you food? Forget food, we can't even sleep peacefully That man doesn't allow us to Hey, will you be here for Christmas? That's what I told him when I left I want to relax for a few days Come on, Ammachi Did the child have food? Nope We wanted to catch the first bus And you are helping yourself? You are just like your Appan Appapan scolded me Oh! What did he tell you, sweetie? -That he will kick me out if I go there -That's okay, dear He can't even lift those legs He is useless from waist down Why don't you pinch his leg, sweetie? Go He must have mistaken you for Abel Come Let's go and meet Appan -Come on -Hey you! Don't wake him up now He will drive us all mad He is a saint if you can sweet-talk him You don't know how to care for him Appan Don't you remember her? Appan Appan -Look who is here -What makes you think I care? Can she make me get up? Why do you always think about getting up? Do you know how long you have been like this? How does it bother you, skunk? I'm lying down on my bed not on your chest Kuttiyamma, you wretch, change my clothes Go away, my child Kids won't be able to bear his tantrums Go inside, sweetie Appan Don't you recognise me? Get out! What is left to recognise you? Recognise, indeed! Didn't I marry you off a long time ago? Recognise, my foot! This is why Boban Chettan refuses to visit Why can't you call us when you want to relieve yourself? Didn't you do it? How many times have you wet the bed? Did I say anything then? When? When he was just a year old? Age is just a number He used to pee like a fountain But you tied up his edge with a rubber band Anyone will tie it up if you pee 10 times a day Then we will tie up yours too Oh yeah Tie it up and prove that you are the daughter of lame Pathrose -Come on -Lame, you... Hey Noonju, buy the cotton thing that covers the bottom Let's swaddle him in it Then he can pee or defecate as much as he wants Am I menstruating that you will cover me up in rags? Save it for yourself If you refuse, we will insert a tube to collect your urine You got it? Got it? Aiyo! Somebody help! He is going to kill me -Somebody please help -Come here Help! Not even the Lord can set this man right My Ammachi is not well She is insisting that I go home for Christmas I want to go this time Who will stay with Ammachi here? Won't you be here? But I came here to relax Doesn't she need to relax? Kuttiyamma What's up with you? Oh Lord! Something or other will happen today They are Appan's friends Noonju already warned you Don't come here until he is dead Why should we come after he is dead? When did you come, Molly? -It's been a while -Is that so? -Where is Noonju? -He is in the yard Then we will meet Itty *Chettan *respectful term for man Appan is fast asleep He will swear if you wake him up We won't be upset even if Itty Chettan swears at us We have known him for a long time Come on Move, you! Itty Chettan Hey Kuttiyamma Rosy Are you happy now? What do you want? I'm right here Where have you been, bitch? Fetch two chairs for these girls No thanks, we are fine Is that so? Come on then Sit beside me Hey, what are you staring at? Come with me Close the door after you, sweetie Hey Noonju Come quickly They keep giving him hope That's why Appan doesn't die Hey! Is this a confessional? I told you a thousand times not to come here What is the matter with you, dog? This is my home Get out if you don't like it If you don't leave now I'll tell Kumaran Chettan Do you want me to do that? How dare he threaten me? Had I tried hard, he would have born to me Dog! They were my only respite You kicked them out too Watch out You won't have any stake in my property -You son of a bitch! -Shut up or I'll kill you Aiyo! -Help! He is going to kill me -Shut up! Help -Shut up -Appan! Are you going to kill Appapan? Of course not We were just playing, son He is lying, brat Your Appan tried to kill me Beware, you rascal When that brat grows up... he will finish you off, skunk What do you want for Christmas, son? -A gun -Gun? For Christmas? Then what? A star... Christmas crib... and some fairy lights I'll buy everything for you Do you like your Appan? Yes, Appan One day, I'll grow old Will you look after me then? Yes, I'll. Why? What if I wet the bed? I'll make you wash the sheet Annamma hasn't visited for a while Did Noonju chase her away too? Appan... Can I give you a rosary? Then you can control your mind and go to Heaven also Give the rosary to your hen-pecked man You know what? Heaven is right here if you can fulfil your desires Who is that? Who is drinking here? Hey, who is that drinking here? Who is drinking here? It must be Chettayi -He is upset -Why? You told him you won't give him any land He is heartbroken I think it's whiskey Aw, 'whishkey'! Hey you, do you know when that worm started drinking? On his first birthday... I gave him two drops of liquor when no one was looking Oh Lord! -Hey -What? Where is my wheelchair? Wheelchair? Your wheelchair is down with a broken leg Go to bed, Appan -Getting on my nerves -You! Hey you Hey Kuttiyamma Get me a drink Hey Kuttiyamma, please get one for me too Eat, drink and have fun That's what he lives for I meant your Appan What is this shit, sonny? Then why don't you brew it yourself? Drink and start whining Your father brewed the best arrack in town If you drink that... just put a wick in your navel and you can burn a lamp there It was that potent Stop bragging and try to get hold of that recipe At least then he will be of some use to us Oh yes Dream on Do you know... when he was dying in hospital I tried to ask him I thought anyway he was going to die He spat at me Neither gives the recipe nor shares a drink He used to brew it and drink it up himself Occasionally, he would give me half a bottle as a price for whistling To hell with your whistling You mock me, huh? -Whistling is a form of music, sonny -Nonsense! Hey, you know what? He went on his trysts as he knew I was on guard outside What a shame, Varghese Chettan! Bragging about facilitating sexual adventures That too my father's No wonder people say things about you Sons of a gun! People indeed! What is the point in blaming me if their women sleep with him? Give me a drink, man! Hey Isn't it your fault that I'm in this state? Hey I trusted your whistling, rascal That's why I went in that night But you dozed off, you dog What does Appan want? How long will he go on like this? That's a peculiar being You can't love him And you can't provoke him I've been through so much It was only after Noonju grew up... that he stopped mistreating me It's your fault, Ammachi Why didn't you walk out on him? Where would I go? It was even worse at my home He knew that quite well Do you know what he told me when I wanted to go home after my father died? Women are queuing up for me If you leave I'll take another woman He is a dog Dog! People in hilly regions live longer But I don't want to live long I've only one wish My Noonju shouldn't suffer... when I die Then I'll go to the cemetery... and relax He won't die until his desires are fulfilled, Varghese Chettan He holds on to his dear life... like a monitor lizard He will never let it go He will get up again You just wait Then he will visit the doctor who said he won't survive a week He will flex his muscles... thump his chest and shout You see, rascals... Itty has three lives Earlier, Rosy used to ask me Why are you like this? Isn't that your Appan? Nope Not even once in my life... have I been his son or has he been my father If I call him 'Appan' lovingly... he will say, 'What do you want, skunk?' How do I love him then? To me... he is just an enemy who will never give up The enemy who ruined the lives of me and my Ammachi I'm done, Varghese Chettan... with this damn life ♪ A viper bit Kuttathi Kunjamma ♪ A hump-nosed pit viper ♪ A viper bit Kuttathi Kunjamma ♪ A hump-nosed pit viper ♪ If it's a viper that bit her ♪ A hump-nosed pit viper, at that ♪ If it's a viper that bit her ♪ A hump-nosed pit viper, at that ♪ It's venomous but worry not ♪ The healer advised ♪ O brother-in-law! ♪ The healer advised ♪ A viper bit Kuttathi Kunjamma ♪ A hump-nosed pit viper ♪ A viper bit Kuttathi Kunjamma ♪ A hump-nosed pit viper ♪ As the night fell... Heh! Who is there? Who is there? Hey Noonju -Get up, come quickly -He won't let anyone sleep They want to kill me with a sledge -Hey, wake up -Are you mad? -It's Kuriakose -Don't encourage Appan Come here, you! -Hey, wake up -Don't we need to sleep in peace? To hell with him Help me! -Help! -Can you stop that? Where have you been all this while, skunk? I saw him at the window He was here to kill me I need to wake up early to tap rubber If you keep barking like this, I'll... Who is that? -Who is there? -I saw him, skunk He tried to attack me through the window Hey, close the window It's Kuriakose, for sure I saw that sledge Just close the damn window -Who is there? -Don't worry, Noonju -You go -What are you doing in my yard? We are leaving, man You go inside What do you want? Answer me What is it, Chettayi? I felt as I saw someone passing by You go back to sleep Could they be her clients? Maybe, I don't know I have said so many times we must kick that whore out of here What can I do? I know you can't do anything Let me tell you something If you start like your father I'll leave with our son Keep that in mind Hey Noonju Did you see who it was? They were just thieves You go back to sleep Thieves? What in the world will they find here? That was Kuriakose -He wanted to kill me -That would be great You must suffer for what you did Alas, we too are suffering with you Get lost, son of a bitch! Chettayi What happened? -What are you thinking? -Nothing It's nothing If you don't get rid of head lice... nobody will marry you -Hello Molly -Sit still, girl -When did you come? -Oh, Johnson Let me get the meter reading How are you, Velu Chettan? -How is politics? -What do I say? Tilling the land was far better How is Appan? Still laid up in bed How long will he carry on like this? Where is Noonju? He went to tap rubber I'll go and meet him Johnson, come on Noonju What are you people doing here? Your power consumption is so high What is it, Velu Chettan? What to say? When I used to till the land my mind was at peace Fixed wages and booze at night I knew peace! And pleasure! Not the problem is... your Appan You tell him, Johnson I want to pee I've been holding it for a while Listen Noonju, as you know... There are a few of us in the village... who wish to see your Appan dead When he got bedridden... we thought it will be the end of him But now... How long do we wait? Everyone has his own deal What do you mean? We can't wait any longer for Appan to die That's what we decided How can that be? Appan isn't dead yet I don't support finishing him at home I'm okay doing it if he gets out It shouldn't be done inside the house But I've a family Besides, what about the police? You got to be kidding Police? Who is afraid of the police? People are vying with each other to kill your Appan and go to jail That's how much they hate him Don't look surprised Your Appan has done terrible things to us If he wasn't your father... Don't create trouble at my home to avenge Appan What about Ammachi and my boy? What trouble, man? I'm here, right? After all, this is my village How do we trust Itty Chettan with his death? How long do we wait for that? He can't live happily ever after He has to die So as a first step... let's administer the Last Sacrament to him We can call the pastor also Sacrament? Like a warning, that's all A gentle reminder of death It may terrify him If it does, he can be finished in the blink of an eye Do you get it? Appan won't agree to it He has to agree That's up to you Or just pretend as if you are taking him to the hospital We can finish him at the chapel junction Sacrament will do I'll take care of that You go Don't get tensed For now, you do this Let's see what else we can do Okay then, goodbye I've to go to the panchayat The yield must be good because of the snow, isn't it? Yes, Chettan Johnson What are you doing today? Anyway, I'll take it home with me So I'd better wrap it up Did Johnson find a girl? How can he get one? That's why he is still mad at Appan Is Johnson really our Appan's son, Ammachi? Why don't you ask Appan yourself? Who knows how many children he fathered? I'm afraid he will come asking for a share in the property -Oh Lord! -Why only Johnson? We have to ensure he leaves everything to us Itty Chettan So... Do you know what the priest said in his sermon last week? Did he say I'll get up and walk? You see... If you die a good death... you will be awarded a better life in paradise So... Shall we give you the Last Sacrament, Itty Chettan? The Last Sacrament is for the dying Why do I need it? Your sins will be pardoned What makes you think I sinned? What I did was to give joy and pleasure to others How can that be considered a sin? Can I ask you something? -What? -Don't you want to die? Varghese How will I find peace if I die without fulfilling my desires? What the... what do you desire at this age? I want to brew my own arrack and drink it And eat game meat with it It should make my head spin And in that drunken state... I want to relish the sight of a cannabis garden Hey Come closer There is something else too Oh Lord! Look... Neither did I ask anything to you nor did you say anything to me I don't want anyone to walk off with my wealth Oh my! Let them walk off with it You know... I love my life more than anything Get him What did he tell you? -Tell me -No, I can't say it You have to say it Move back... or you may knock me down, Noonju He... You know Sheela, right? He wants to see that whore You whore! I'll show you what I can do -Ammachi -It's been a while now I can't turn a blind eye anymore -Ammachi -I'll teach her a lesson -I won't let her get away with it -Ammachi -Let go of me -Ammachi -Stop there -Stop it -Ammachi -Let go of me You slut How long has this affair been going on? -Ammachi -Don't you have other men too? Then why are you after this paralysed man? Why are you blaming that woman for what he said? Why do you feel sorry for her? You are his son, after all It definitely shows Ammachi, don't talk rubbish -If someone hears this... come here -Hey you You should be careful too Make sure he sleeps beside you at night Why are you doing this to me? Why do you blame me for everything? Kuttiyamma, where the hell are you? If you dare insult her I'll beat the hell out of you You dog! Ammachi, stop it -Let me go -Stop it, Ammachi You scoundrel What will you do to her laid up like this? Ammachi What should I do with him, Varghese Chettan? Get some alcohol and cannabis Maybe he will give up on his life... once his desires are fulfilled On the second day after she moved into that house... I saw his underwear lying on her clothesline Then Noonju told me... a thousand men may have similar underwear Don't you remember it, Molly? Yellow and blue with long stripes I don't remember it What the hell do you remember then? She can't remember her Appan's underwear Can you believe it? Won't you remember it if it were about your husband? My Boban Chettayi will never do such a thing Boban! -Here, have it -Thanks to your indulgent father... I married you off to that bull so you won't remain a spinster Ammachi So many men visit her -It could be someone else's -Nonsense! You better note the colour of Noonju's underwear Whose son is he, after all? He may have his father's traits There is no point in shouting If you ever take a wrong turn... I won't bear it like your mother did Why do you all compare me to Appan, Rosy? Yes, I was born as his son Is that my fault? I've been hearing this taunt for a long time Itty's son! I'm fed up of it How much more should I suffer? I've seen him at her house many times What will Ammachi do when she knows? I buried everything within me I buried everything I'm done now It started ever since I was born, Rosy Just because I was Itty's son... people stopped me at the junction stripped me and chased me away I still panic when I go there What did I do, Rosy? Is it because I was born as Itty's son? Chettayi Chettayi Make sure this works, Varghese Chettan When his desires are fulfilled he will bid farewell to this life Just wait and watch Move Is it Kurumban's arrack? Yes Why are you so friendly to me all of a sudden? Hey, help me sit up Slowly Keep the pillow behind me Hold tight How is it? He doesn't know how to brew good arrack Nobody is as good as you are, Chettayi Hey Yes What about meeting Sheela? We will see, Chettayi But before that... try this one Here you go Come on I've done a lot of terrible things Varghese... To be honest, I'm fed up I don't think I'll ever get up again What's the point in living then? True Very true, Chettayi Don't tell them anything About what, Chettayi? I've caused a lot of trouble to Noonju My wealth should be in safe hands after my death So... I want to entrust everything to Noonju I should give something to Molly also She has a daughter You are right And you? How long have you been my ally? If I don't do something for you... the Lord will ask me when I meet Him after my death There's nothing to ask -It's nonsense -I won't allow it Be quiet, let him talk Chettayi, you know... I've a daughter What about the other two? They must be his neighbour's She is getting marriage proposals but they are placing high demands I have sisters also We will work something out Let me talk to Sheela first Sheela? But why? That's what I've been trying to tell you I've wronged many people during a rough patch in my life All because I was mad at Kuttiyamma and Noonju This property... and a few other plots about which nobody else knows are in Sheela's name Aiyo -I've to get it back from her -Will she give it back? But will she give it back? Why not? I'll make sure of that You make sure that she comes Ammachi can't walk away like that You must convince her, Chettayi This is in our interest I left empty-handed after my marriage I'll never bring this up with Ammachi She won't be able to bear it You go, I want to sleep But if you doze off... Chettan You need to stay alive We need to prepare your will Chettayi Appan? Wake up, Appan Appan Appan, you can go after writing it down What are you doing, Molly? He isn't dead He is just high High, my foot If something happens to my Appan I'll get the police to arrest you Why did you give him arrack and cannabis? -Come here -Appan -But what did I... -Come Why am I being blamed here? Are you sure he is just high? Will he be okay? I did this because you told me to Now everyone is blaming me -Do you think what he said is true? -What? About his property Does it really belong to her? Does he have undisclosed wealth? Of course He will give away even his kidney... for the sake of a woman Oh Lord! My poor Ammachi What about me, sonny? All I have is a small patch of land I wasted my life following Itty Chettan If he gives me something I can marry off my daughter Then I can rest peacefully Here I'm worried about losing my home and you talk about your gain But he agreed to give me a share Boban Chettayi You should be here by dawn No, he's not dead yet It's about his will No, I mean it's about his property He said he has undisclosed wealth Chettayi... Come quickly Come here Appan Are you still asleep? Look who is here Who? Son-in-law, it's you? I've not seen in you in a long time I've been... a little busy, Appan Are you less busy now? Do you know what he got for you? -What? -Oh, some cannabis Hey, don't give it to him I thought he was done yesterday He is giving it out of love Where did you get it so early in the morning? -Do you smoke? -I... No Appan, no way He was such a healthy man! How are you now, Appan? Still the same, sonny Hey Noonju Molly Go and call Sheela I need to settle something with her And one more thing Don't invite her without Kuttiyamma's consent Get her permission first Stop there, Ammachi Don't be difficult, Ammachi You don't know about our plight Boban Chettayi is out of work That's why he came as soon as I called Will you send a woman to your husband's room? But this isn't just for me Noonju Chettayi wants it too Chettayi doesn't say anything -It's on his mind though -Molly Don't talk rubbish Did I tell you anything? We lead a peaceful life here If you try to create trouble... We have been tolerating you for a while -I'm at my... -Hey, stop it Don't argue about me I'll excuse this time as well Five minutes She should leave as soon as the matter is settled If she stays longer... Please call Sheela *Chechi *respectful term for woman Sheela Chechi? Oh really! Remember one thing -I should get what was promised to me -What? Hey Varghese, go and call her Everyone will get exactly what they need, I promise You heard that? -Molly -Yes, Appan -Hey Molly -Coming -What is it, Appan? -There is jasmine scent in the closet Bring it to me Oh that's what What the hell is that scoundrel telling her? Whatever you do... get everything back from her Oh, you are here Sheela Chechi I'm Molly, Appan's daughter -I know all of you -Sheela Get Kuttiyamma's permission and come here No need of that Ammachi is okay with it You go inside I came to find out why you called Oh, such a saint! You think nobody knows what you are -Ammachi, don't talk rubbish -Shut up! Aren't you ashamed? Were you really born to her? Listen... Tell him what you want to say and get out of here I didn't come to stay here I came invited Stop it, Noonju Don't shout Sweetie, enter with your right foot in without wasting time -Come on -Go Right foot first Sheela Close that door -Yes, please do -Lock it up Yeah sure Leave it, Ammachi It's okay It's for your kids Get lost, you! -Kids and quids -Molly Be quiet, let's get this done Come on Oh my goodness! Ammachi Can I have a towel? Unwashed is fine To clean him up You slut -I'm going to kill you -Ammachi -Noonju -Ammachi -Let go of me -I said let go of me -Shut the door -I'll show her what I'm -Shut the door -Just shut it -You will see what I can do Leave me ♪ O Amminiyamma, who walks with a strutting gait ♪ I saw someone lurking in the yard where you fly about I'll finish her today ♪ With no guardian or custodian ♪ You dilly-dally ♪ And ogle women, young laddie ♪ If you mess with Ammini you mess with fire Stop it, Ammachi! ♪ One day, when I came to buy betel leaves for granny ♪ I saw someone lurking in the attic, once again I didn't do anything wrong It was him who... Get out, you slut Get out Go -Let go of me -Ammachi, stop it Hello, stop there What about the property? Property? What property? No property? -What? -Ammachi... Then what in the world did he tell us? How can I die without fulfilling my desires, you worm? You know... I got that item from Wayanad She is my wife My second wife I wanted to welcome her into this house with your blessings It was another one of my desires Now it's been fulfilled You are such a wicked man -Chettayi -Why do you do this to my Ammachi? -Tell me -His poor Ammachi! -Stop it, Chettayi -Come on -How long has your Ammachi been with me? -Move -You see this? -Leave him She revived me in five minutes That's my woman I'll tether your toes soon You just wait -Sucker! -Or I'm not your son, you creep Hey Noonju -Chop him into pieces -What is it? -Ammachi -I'll go to jail -No, Ammachi -Aiyo, help -What are you doing?

Thank God, we are still alive Let's get out of here -Hey, let me get on -Someone please help -They are killing me -Let's go -Aiyo, somebody help me -Go! Why should we sacrifice for him? So many are waiting for a chance to kill him If I just give a nod... -they will finish him -Stop it, Chettayi Oh Lord! Somebody help me Help me They are going to kill me They are going to kill me Noonju? I'm Suku -Shall we go there? -No, I'll sit here Don't you have to draw columns? What for? Those are silly tricks Drawing columns, daubing ash, blazing fire... The key is to chant mantras perfectly My ancestors passed on their legacy to me I'm not really interested in it But Johnson came and requested me... So I decided to come all the way to do it Actually I'm the Party's branch secretary This is only a side business I've completed all the rituals Its throat is stuffed with rice and flowers after chanting the mantra Yo must chop off its head at this point Place the body in a bag along with a bottle of liquor Then picture the spirit in mind... and hand it over to me Do you understand? Take it Varghese Chettan -Are you his son? -No His son must do it himself Only then will the soul find a good body to perch on Place the rooster's head in a coconut-shell bowl Then take a banana leaf and bind tightly around it Bury it in the direction... of the dying man's head That's it Noonju He settles every case he takes up Appan will surely be gone today What will it cost? Not a single rupee Balan sir will take care of the expenses -Don't tell anyone -Balan sir? You mean our teacher Balan? -Yes -Why? He is ready to spend any amount of money But only on one condition When Appan dies... Balan sir will plug cotton in his nostrils Oh Lord! Chettayi Should we really do it? You too saw what he did to Ammachi That creep has to die Then why don't you ask them to come and finish him, Noonju? Why should we take so much trouble? Once it's done, they will get away And our Ammachi will be in jail This will do Nobody can sue us for this -Are you a physician? -No, Chettan I came to free your soul from this worn-out body So that it can find a healthy body Sorcery! Sit next to me, sorcerer Who hired you? My son or daughter? Don't think of such things Pray Seek forgiveness for your sins Close your eyes and pray Excuse me Whom should I pray to? My Lord or your God? I don't believe in your religion Then how will your sorcery work, you skunk? Go and find a proper job, scoundrel Free my soul, my foot! Schmuck! -Ruined my nap! -What happened? I've to work harder at this one This is not an easy spirit It's a tough one -Where is my headless chicken? -Here And liquor? Let's go then Light this cannabis for me You crook! -Noonju -Hey Noonju -Leave him, Noonju -Let go of him, son -Hey, let go of him -Stop it, Chettayi -What the hell are you doing? -Get away from me -I'll kill this man -Stop it! -What's wrong with you? -Hands off! Cough Keep coughing Yes, keep going I'm out of breath -Chettayi... -Sonny... Let him die -Noonju -Son of a gun What the hell did you do? Noonju If I ever fall sick...

I found my father dead He was murdered I didn't know what to do That was when a father figure came to my rescue Itty Chettan But... even before we got down the mountain pass... I knew he wasn't my saviour All he wanted was my body I suffered a lot A lot When I came to know the truth... I wanted to avenge my father's killer Who killed your father?
