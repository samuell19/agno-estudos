Around the time of the first years of the Christian calendar, the Romans were pushing their great empire to the corners of the known earth. Through Greece and Turkey, across the desert sands of Northern Africa, over the arid plains of Libya, across the blood-soaked battlefields of France, and finally, to the end of the world, as they knew it, to the 45th and last province of the Roman Empire: Britain. The little kingdoms that made up this inhospitable island... were governed by a handful of Roman officers. These officers trained only in the art of warfare, did their best to govern wisely, but it was not easy. They were commanding less than 40,000 men- digruntled soldiers. Now that the fighting was over, there were very few of them who were not eager to get back to the sunny shores and farms of Italy, away from the rainy skies of Britain... and the still present threat of attack blue-woaded bandits. - Bloody country! - Get along there! They can handle their chariots. I'll say that for these Britons. Is that all you can say for them, Octavian? Caesar was defeated twice by those same chariots. That was a hundred years ago. They've grown soft since then. Soft or peaceful? It's not necessarily the same. This is what kept the peace, a Roman sword. You seem to forget that. I do not forget that I am Governor General, Octavian, but you sometimes need reminding. Ave, Justinian! Tristram! Meet my son, Fergus! He drivs your chariot well. You must be proud of him. Octavian, has the king's will been approved in Rome? Tiberian has just returned with him. - The Emperor has approved it. - Good, but we must hurry. King Priam is sinking fast. The Chief Druid has already started the death rites. - The Druid? The religion is forbidden! - In public, Octavian, that's all. To acknowledge them at all undermines discipline. They preach treason. A dying man has their right to their prayers, if he expects to be reborn. They preach against the rule of Nero and the ceremonies are filthy, disgusting... Enough! Emperor Nero is about to inherit half the kingdom, more than fair exchange for one Druid ceremony. - We're riding on ahead! - There's a short route over the hills. Warn your men there are blue bandits about! Captain Servion, build your line! Centurions, muster your men at ease! Tristram! Where are you? He's not back yet, father. Back... My will... You may not have any need for it. There is the greatest need for it, Salina. It should never have been made. Beatrice! A betrayal to us all! Maelgan! He is very near to death, my ladies. - He must live to complete his wish. - It would be better if he died. It is written in the clouds that the king shall sign such a will. And that you will wear armor and carry a sword in your right hand. It has been written. I must name my successor. Successor? Beatrice, you would be the natural choice, but it would not be a wise one. You and the Romans are like oil and water. Father, how can you? It is my birthright. And your association with the Druids... would end only in disaster. The Druids are the priests of your sacred brotherhood. And you, Maelgan, are ambitious to rule this country. Do you deny that? And that would be ruin for us all. Little Talia, if innocence and a sweet disposition were all that was required to run the country, you would be my choice. Unfortunately, it needs a level head too. I have given this much thought, Salina, And you are my choice. You will govern with tolerance and understanding. Like your mother, you will be a Viking queen. Come closer, my child. My blessing. Justinian is here, Your Majesty. - Justinian? - Yes Your Majesty. The will? The terms are exactly as you wish. Read it to me. "I, Tiberian, appointed Notary by the court of Rome, have prepared the following last will and testament of King Priam of Icenia, on the island of Brittany. According to your wishes, the Kingdom of Icenia will belong jointly to the Emperor Nero ... and the daughter who succeeds King Priam as queen." Contested by his own hand and dated this day. Good. Father, you can't sign that! Your people would never accept it! They will accept it, if they are allowed to. It is the richest... most peaceful kingdom... in this island of Britain. By signing this, it will remain so. Father! Hear! The gods have given their sign! I, Maelgan, by the powers vested in me by Dis and Zeus, do hereby charge you, Salina, queen of Icenia, before the sacred mistletoe and the golden sickle, to lead your people wisely, to shelter and protect them from all who seek to harm them... All who seek to dominate them... and all who seek to enslave them! Halt! Salina, now that you aree queen, I beg you to govern wisely. - Half your lands belong to the Emperor Nero. - Stolen by a trick! Don't heed the political ravings of the Druids! We are the rightful leaders of the people! You are under Roman leadership! You'll do as you're told. - Stop that! Can you not even let our dead king rest in peace? Go! All of you. - And leave me alone with him. Please. Tristram... How can I be a queen? There is a time to be queen and a time to be a woman. Help me, father. Come on, dogs! You are not a lot of blue-painted, meat eating Britons! Catus, the horses. When do you wish to see our new queen? Your Majesty. I have a request to make before you leave. What? That the king ... That the body of my father... be be burned on a funeral pyre before his subjects. - That's the Druid way! - Yes! You know that all public Druid ceremony is prohibited under Roman law. Not under Icenia law. The rule of Icenia is now jointly divided. Tristram, you are a wise man. What do you say? The trees that bend a little with the wind last longest. - You have my permission. - Thank you. You're a long, long way from London, Osiris. What's a rich merchant like you have to do here? I've come to pay my respects to the new queen of Icenia. Just how has your greedy brain worked out how to make gold out of her? I am your obedient servant governor General. - I'm not governor general. - Not yet. - What is it Centurion? - An ambush, sir. - What was that? - The column, sir. It was ambushed by Britons. - Dead? - Two. - Wounded? - Eight. I withdraw my consent. - You will not hold your Druid ceremony. - What do do mean? ot until you learn to keep your savages under control. My prople are not savages! Furthermore you will hold no public cermonies until I tell you. Is that understood? Is that understood? - I understand. - Good! Prepare the funseral pyre for tonight. Oh, Zeus, Accept this offering of Priam's body. And see that his spirit does not wander long. Zeus, Zeus! And see we pray, that his new body and life will be fruitful. Zeus, Zeus! We beseech thee by the holy oak to see that his new body is firm and strong. And that his new life has meaning and direction to oust the invader from our shores! Zeus, Zeus! And we shall make a virgin sacrifice to Zeus. So that our words will not go unanswered. No! If any virgins are to be sacrificed, it'll be to us! I want them alive! Drive them back! They're to be taken to London. All of them! The Empire needs slaves in Rome. Hold! Hold! The ritual for the burial of a Briton king... is older than the Roman law over this land. There's only one law here, my lady- ours! - And it's been violated! - By whose authority do you do this? A good question, Catus. What is the answer, Catus? By whose authority? - Arcadians? - Sir, this is a public ceremony of the Druid? - And they preach treason. - Well? - You forbade a public ceremony. If you look at those with me you will see that it is private. - Release the prisoners. - Hand over the wounded. Go back to your village, all of you! Catus, take your men back to the encampment. Hail, Justinian, the Roman who understands us! Don't misinterpret what you've seen here tonight, Maelgan. If need be, my hand can be heavy. No man-made laws can truly set aside the teachings and the powers of the Druids. Please, Maelgan. Justinian has proved himself a friend tonight. My lady... do not spurn those whose strength you will need one day. My family are grateful for what you have done this night. And the queen? Is she? Hail, Justinian! Catus is confined to quarters until further notice. He was acting under my orders. Of course he was! He hasn't the intelligence to act on his own. Well? Your explanation, I'm not interested Catus! I don't consider any explanation needed. Your orders for the Britens were quite clear. They were disobeyed. I took punative measure. You took measures? You took measures! Octavian, when you will learn? - As far as I can see... - You will never see! Not ever! Octavian...you have been in the service of the Empire longer than I. And I reaced my rank by hard work and experience. Not because of friends in Rome. If I have been promoted above you may seem unfair... nevertheless, it is a fact! I am Governer General. And until I am relieved of that post, I intend to govern! Without any interference from you! Is that clear? May I remind you excellency that you are a soldier... A Roman soldier... and with respect may I suggest you behave like one? - Octavian! You have my permission...to leave. Now. Hail Justinian. Your Majesty, we have horses for you. What for? Surely you don't intend to hunt boar in that? Why not? - The ground is rough. - We are used to that. You should try it. By Jupiter, I wish I could. You can. Have mine. The ground is rough. This way! Salina, Salina, slow down! It's strange this shou;d happen to me. - Oh? - I'm speaking of love. It's strange it should happen to me in this way. - Are you sorry, Salina? - No. That's settled, then. Settled? We'll announce our forthcoming marriage. Is a Roman governor not suitable for a queen? - If the Druids will permit it. - The Druids, they have no power now. New laws, even the Roman ones. can't change the way people feel. Well, what about the way we feel? - Doesn't that matter? - No. I am a queen now. I wish my father I would have chosen Beatriz. Let us leave well alone now and know a little happiness. Justinian, you must understand. You alone must understand. I cannot allow dissention to divide my people. You are speaking like a Roman law book. Our marriage would make peace more certain. If we are to have a son, your son, who will be accepted by all under our law, the Druids must agree to our marriage. I am Govenor. Laws can be changed. Changing laws won't change people. Then I shall see that enough people want the law changed so that even the chief Druid will have to agree. My poor Justin. You don't know Maelgan as I do. Only signs in Heaven, not people, can do that. Let us pray that the signs are favorable. Read this page of wind and air. I don't care what that old man reads in the clouds. Salina is entitled to be happy. Besides, I like Justinian. - A Roman? - He's a man. He can never be trusted! His first allegiance is to Nero. Well, Dalan? Ill tidings, father. He learns. What does he learn? This land will run with blood. Possibly. The sign that people want today concerns a marriage. Not the political hopes of the Druids. Save your wit for the court, Tristram. If you will only use your eyes, you will see that thw will of Zeus is clearly written. The future is there! Written in the clouds! Rain? When Roman steel ... pierces your chest, you may have a moment to recall this day. Yes, Tristram. Yes, Tristram. That too is written in the clouds. All right, Maelgan, do you agree to this marriage or not? There will be no marriage for Queen Salina neither now or any other time. But your queen wishes this marriage. You must agree! Even a queen must give way to the messagel of Zeus. Perhaps the Druids will have to give way. Threats? Be a disbeliever if you wish, Tristram, but I'll tell you one more thing. Salina herself, in the near future, will call on the power of the Druids ... to aid her in cutting the Roman shackles that bind this land. We'll have our honeymoon in a big white villa overlooking the sea. And we'll go swimming every morning before breakfast. No! No, the sea is warm there and it's a deep blue-green - As bue-green as... - Your eyes. - And we'll have a little boat and go fishing. - No. You go and fish, as I lay in the sun until my skin goes black like a Nubian slave. And we'll drink wine... lots and lots of wine. And you will fall out of the boat. No! On the terrace, in the evenings I will watch the slaves coming back from the fields carrying their baskets of grapes and singing. Grapes? Yes, they're big brown berries and they make wine from them by tramping on them with their feet. And then you drink that? The sun always shines there. It almost never rains. And it's the most beautiful place in all the world. - And... - And? And we'll live happily. If it is the will of the gods. Oh, pray that it will be. Salina, look! The Chief Druid refuses, my lady. I have been too lenient with him. - Some Roman disipline... - No, Justinian. Action against the Druids will only lead to trouble among our people. It will destroy everything you and my father have worked for. Then order him to perform the rite! You are queen, order him! Maelgan reads the signs as the gods decree! Your gods are politicians! No more than Roman ones, I presume. Thank you for reminding me, Tristram. But even in Rome, sometimes the voices of the people are louder than those of the gods. The Queen should hear the full prophecy. - He said this land shall run with blood, and... - Whose? - Who's blood? Did he say? - His, I hope. Well said, my Briton friend. Nevertheless, the queen cannot accept a marriage not blessed by the Chief Druid. You can't wipe out a thousand years of religious belief, just like that! With the people on our side they'll have to listen. As I said, I can't possibly pay in full, your majesty. Not with the stinking, rotten harvest we had last year. Your majesty's pardon. But you know what it was like as well as I do. although the Druids promised it would be good if we just... If we did what they said. But they let us down again. With respect to your majesty, as they always do. Get to the point man. Yes, well the point is that I can't pay my taxes. Not all of them, that is, unless I sell one of my oxen. And if I sell him I won't be able to plough my land properly. And that means another stinking harvest next year. - Begging your majesty's pardon and... - That's enough! Yes your Majesty. You know that the Roman taxes must be paid. I do, your majesty, - Indeed I do. - Do you know why they must be paid? - Yes, sir. - Why? - Well? - Because you'll knock us about if we don't! The money you pay in taxes we use to build your new roads, provide an army to protect you against aggressors - Do you appreciate that? Well, do you? - Yes, I do. You don't seem very impressed. With respect, general, I am an old man. I've never left this village, and never likely to now. What good are your roads to me? - How much do you owe? - 20 croats. And how much can you pay? Six? Then pay the six. You are excused the remainder. That is if her majesty agrees. I think your actions to be most generous. The law says that all taxes must be paid in full. The law was made in Rome, This is not Rome. If the emperor should get word of it... We'll make up our loses, Tiberian. Never fear. If it please your majesty, I too am having trouble to meet the demand to pay my taxes. Was yours a poor harvest too, Osiris? With respect, your majesty knows I'm not a farmer. - Not even a... - What are you then? I buy and sell things, general. Then you are a merchant! Are you a good merchant? I am generally considered to be so, yes. Good. Then you make a profit on your dealings? A small profit, sir, yes. Your customers seem to think you too modest, merchant. from the looks of your clothing I'd say you make a very good profit. Times are hard, sir. They always are, for all of us. In the course of your business, do you make use of our fine new roads? On occassion. And on those occasions, have you ever been robbed? Never. Then you've found the protection given you by our soldiers to be of value to you? - Yes sir. - Excellent. How much do you owe, merchant? 20 croats, that was the sum of the tax, sir... twenty croats. Which I am sure you will agree is an insufficient sum... for all the services that we provide for you. I would suggest that a more reasonable figure would be... - Fifty croats. - Fifty! That is unless your majesty thinks I'm being too harsh. Or too lenient. I know that this man can well afford it. That's settled then. All you rich merchants, you have grown fat on your trading. While most of your countrymen are poor, their taxes will be lowered. And yours will be raised to make up the difference. - This man is impossible. - Yes. What can we do about it? I have apowerful friend in the garrison. He owes me some return for past favours. - All right! - Keep your ranks. Is it true about these tax concessions? Concessions for some, harsher measures for others. Weakness. That's what they'll say it is. When you become weak to the conquered people, they think you've grown tired- even afraid! - Justinian, for your own good... - And the good of your friends? I'm not thinking of myself, only of the Empire. Of course. We must treat these Britons for what they are- A conquered people! Part of our empire, paying Roman tribute because of this- the strength of our steel! - Always the conqueror. - My watch. So is your blindness. I agree that an army must be run by the book, but this is a race of civilians that we rule, not a legion of trained men. If they prosper we prosper, and Rome prospers. But if we break them with taxes they'll be no good for themselves or anyone else. Are you sure your generosity towards these Britons is inspired by the Empire? Or could it be that your love for one particular Briton may be influencing your decision? Get out of my sight. Get out! Hail, Justinian. Get out of the way! You too, Tiberian? - What do you mean? - Please. Your behaviour at the queen's court. It was rather indiscreet, almost dangerous. But amusing, don't you think? when word of this gets about people will flock to our side. We will be heroes too. And then? We can snap our fingers at the Druids. And you can marry the queen? Yes. Why bring us here? To save your skins while you still have them. It will cost you money though. Money! There'll be none of that left by the time Justinian is finished with us. So, the sooner we finish with him, the better. - We finish him? - No, the Druids. We are merchants, my friend. You must be prepared to spend money to make it. Maelgan seeks power. We shall buy it for him. Maelgan's lust for power is his weakness. We shall make it our strength. Every man has his weakness, my friend. He listens to every word you say. Young upstart! Accept you can't influence everything. By rights I should be the governing general. - Is there a chance then? - No, none. It... could be arranged. Well, go on merchant! Suppose there were an outbreak of Druidism. From somewhere far away... Let us say, in Anglesey. You and your troops would have to go. And who would have to lead them? I would! But um, suppose you were not here to lead them? - Suppose you were away on another mission? - A small uprising that I can arrange with my friend over there. - You might even volunteer for that. - Then when you were away... We can start the larger uprising - in Anglesby and Justinian and his troops would have to go. As soon as he's gone? You come back to become Governor General and reinstate proper Roman law. Which would suit you better, hey merchant? Which would suit us both, governor. I thought it better if Justinian didn't return. They came down from the hills, hundreds of them. All painted with that filthy bue stuff. - Were they armed? - To the teeth! Of couse we were so taken by surprise we could do nothing. Besides, we carry no arms as you well know. We're not permitted to under Roman law. - Yes, yes. Are you sure of your facts? - Where are the rest of your party? Dead, assassinated, brutally murdered, every last one of them. Fifty groats I paid. Fifty! And how is it that you escaped, merchant? I feigned death. It wasn't difficult! - I was near enough to it. - Send Octavian to me. - When did this happen? - Three days ago. Three days it took me to reach here. I had to walk. All my mules had been stolen by the savages. - You've heard? - TThe whole garrison's buzzing with it. - Do you want me to go? - Yes. Take a sufficient force to deal with it. - Shouldn't take long. - Take this fellow with you too. - What? - He can indicate exactly where it happened. To Anglesey! Death to the Romans! Death to the Romans! Death to the Romans! Death to the Romans! - I have grave news. - What is it? A Druid rebellion at the home of their sacred fire, Anglesey. And Fergus has joined them. - I know. - You know? Beatriz is with them too. What happens if it spreads to here? Justinian leavesfor Angelsey tonight with a legeion of picked men. He intends to destroy the power of the Druids forever. - Fergus? - He chose to join them! Salina, no matter what he has done I want him to live. Justinian will listen to you. Speak with him before he leaves. - Beg him for mercy. - And for your sister? - Poor child. - Poor father. I have no son. Justinian has to pass this way. I will ride out and meet him. Come on, fall in. Come on, fall in. Pick it up there now! Come on, fall in. Come on, fall in! When Octavio returns, he will soon command. I fear for the Britons under him. You understand? I understand - Hail, Tiberio. - Hail, Justinian. We match! Their Queen, sir. March on. I'll rejoin the column. March! I have to go. - Couldn't Tiberian? - No, Salina, he's a civilian. He stays in my place. Until Octavian returns? Too much is happening at once. We want to get married. Maelgan refuses. You make the laws easier for the people, and the Druids revolt. Now you have to go away from me. Call it what you like, but to me everything is happening more like some evil plan. When I return we will be married. The power of the Druids will be broken forever. - How long will you be away? - Six weeks, perhaps. - Maybe shorter. - Six weeks...without you. Hold me close. It's a long way to rejoin my column. Don't worry about Octavian. It's true he's ambitious, but he knows he'll have to answer to me on my return. Justinian, Tristram's son has joined them- the Druids. - I'll do what I can, but ... - I understand. Thank you. We'll wait till he's well on his way to Anglesey... Then we'll strike! Come on! I think it's going to work out well for us. And Rome shall be pleased with an extra batch of Britain's slaves. Pleased, and I hope appreciated. Watch those ranks right there! Charge! All my goods, your majesty. They took them all. And the little gold I had saved. They took that as well. They said it was for an increase in taxes. Our son was taken...for service in Rome, my lady! What are we to do? What are we to do? I know what you are suffering under Octavian's rule. But we must have patience. All of you. Justinian will return. I promise you. Aye, but when? But when, your majesty? He's been gone six weeks now. We can't stand another six weeks of this situation. The Queen... Your queen is tired. She's had little rest these past weeks. But with respect, sir, we must have an answer. You shall have it. Tomorrow. Salina, I have given this much thought. And you are my choice. You will govern with tolerance and understanding. Like your mother, you will be a Viking queen. He cannot help you now, my child. Only I can do that. Do you dare to return? Your true destiny is at hand. It cannot be averted. It was written long ago by Zeus. Written in the clouds for all with eyes to see! Written and foretold by me. Your voice shall be heard across the heart of the land. He speaks the truth, Salina. "A queen shall take up the sword ... and drive the invader from our land while his strength is still divided. " It was ordained by the gods. Don't you see? - It is their doing. A sign. - Take up the sword! Lead your people. I realise Octavian that I am not in a position to criticise what you do. - Then don't. - But I have definite orders from Justinian. Justinian, Justinian. Your Justinian's a long way away, Tiberian. And it may be a long time before he returns. If he returns. - I wish to apply for leave of absence to rejoin him. - Not granted. That is all there is to be said on that matter. But there is another matter I wish to discuss with you, Tiberian. That will, yes the one signed by the dead king. Has it been returned to Rome? No, I still have it. Then you will destroy it, and you will draw up another. I'm sure a man of your education will find no difficulty in duplicationg the signature of a dying man? You're asking the impossible. Nothing is impossible when ordered by your superior officer. - Rome will not tolerate it. - Rome would welcome it. The will was read in front of witnesses. Witnesses? Three foolish women, a rebel Druid and a dead king! - And Tristram? - Can be silenced. His son has joined the rebels. I cannot do it. I am ordering you to do it. As you know I was a slave once. Even lower than these Britons that you hold in such poor esteem. It took years of study to cast away my chains and reach the position I hold now. But I would far prefer to return to slavery and keep my self respect. Then keep it. Catus! There was ann ambush. He died fighting bravely. See to it. And have his quarters searched. There's something there I want destroyed. I have made my decision. Tristram will take a message from me to Justinian, telling him of all that is happening here. But your Majesty, that will take a long time. I shall ride day and night. I'll reach Angelsey before the moon has changed. With respect, sir, you've got to get there and back! By then it may be too late. I say we should answer the Romans in the only way they understand. - Yeas! - Before it is too late. I know of your losses, Nigel, and what you have suffered. But I also know that Icenia blood must not be spilled on our land.. We must have patience. Your majesty, we all know your motives are of the highest, but surely it is better we have weapons forged and die with them in our hands, rather than be trampled into the ground like insects? My father, your king, wanted peace in our land. He said that Romans and Britons could live together. And with Justinian carrying out the terms of his will in this land. Will? What will? You have entered this court uninvited, Octavian. Court? It's only Roman indulgence that allows you even to live here. Your rudeness is only surpassed by your ignorance! And now even that indulgence no longer exists. The soft days are over. The Empire requires gold! Under the terms of this will, all the property of Icenia belongs to the EmperorNero, - and I declare them forfeit. What manner of lie is this? Read it. This is not the will of the king. This will is a forgery. It's a forgery! Talia! Talia! Talia! Come, my little one. Watch the sport. - No! Talia! You will be next. Enough. Enough! About turn. On the double. Talia! See the work of your Roman friends! - Now! Now will you take up the sword? You were right in your prophecy. This land shall run with blood. Father! Father! Who is that? Bring him in here! Sir! Bring him as well. Some wine Father. Back...I must go back before it's too late. - Octavian? - Yes A brutal attack. - The Queen... - What about her? Flogged. Publicly flogged. - And Talia? - No. Octavian... - What of Tiberian? - Vanished. The Britons will fight back. They will fight. You must go. - Maelgan was right then. - No. It was I who was wrong. Captain! Prepare to leave. We march tonight. He's dead. Come on, pick your feet up! - Don't let those prisoners lag! Guard those prisoners! Take them! Make fast, they're only women! Come on! You! Mercy, mercy! No mercy. No mercy! Don't kill him! I want him prisoner! He shall die by the holy fire. - A sacrifice Zeus has smiled on you today. Everything that is Roman shall be burnt to the ground. - No man shall live. We shall have no mercy. - But Justinian? - He is a Roman too, isn't he? Then Fergus was always right. Look! - Hail, Justinian. - What happened? They came just like devils, men and women. For weeks they've been killing, burning wherever there are Romans. What of General Octavian? He is a prisoner of their queen. See to this man. You shall die by the sacred fire at the next full moon! An offering to the gods for our present victory and success in the next battle. - Do you hear me, Salina? - Yes, I heard you. The next battle. Against Justinian. Your majesty, an emissary under a white flag has arrived from Justinian. He wishes to speak to you. The power of Zeus! He pleads for peace. Have none of this, Salina. I will receive him. My commanding officer requests a meeting on neutral ground. Only two riders will accompany you. - It's a trap! - And the same will be with him. A trap. Send him away. The word of Justinian has never been broken. Continue. One of those with you shall be Octavian. Octavian? No! He belongs to Zeus. He belongs to the gods. With Justinian will be the son of Tristram. Fergus! The exchange must be made before the meeting starts. It cannot be. Octavian must die by the holy fire. Salina, Fergus must live. I beseech you! I warn you. Deny your promised sacrifice and Zeus will turn away from you. The exchange. Talk, Roman! You asked for this meeting! No. We will talk alone. It would be easier to talk if I didn't have to look up to you. Come. Well, Justin? Salina, you must surrender. Surrender and somehow I'll satisfy Rome. It's too late now. My people have tasted freedom, They won't go back to slavery. There was no slavery while I was here. You are the exception, Justinian, but you cannot live forever. Salina, trust me. I can do that with my own live flesh, not with the lives of others. You must surrender. I have a legion of trained troops. Trained to kill. You'll all be massacred. Do you want to die, Salina? No. But you cannot measure the price of liberty in that way. What can I say? What can I say? Just say that you love me before I go back. I...I love you. Hurry! Come on! Keep moving. - Come on! faster! - Come on! Stand fast! Death to the Romans! Come on! Charge! Again! We attack them again! Legions, stay still! The chariots are reforming, sir. Standing! Reform your lines! Get under those trees! Under the trees! Listen, soldiers! When the chariots next attack, open up your ranks and let them through. Spread out! Close ranks! Close off these ranks here. Close off this flank! Hold! Kill then! You are a soldier! Do your duty! She's to be taken to Rome to stand public trial. To stand trial? To be sent to Rome as a slave! Salina! This is not the dream we made... my darling.
