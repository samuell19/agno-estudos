The prophecy says that you will never be all-powerful until the Jungle Girl has been sacrificed We'll prepare the sacrifice, you'll go bring her Your wish shall be carried out The Jungle Girl has brought us knowledge of the Almighty Star, but she also brought the misfortune of Queria drawing away from us and becoming the priestess of evil Her jealousy upon the Jungle Girl's arrival was great How did she arrive? Many years ago, in a nearby forest, we were drawn by a strange light The prophecy had been fulfilled The star, with it's cosmic energy, brought us the Jungle Girl A child who was raised among tame wolves Queria, feeling that she had been replaced, decided to abandon us and to take the path of evil That stone is the Almighty Star, it came from the cosmos and brings us all it's energy and wisdom and she is a deity That was the origin of the Jungle Girl, who will bring light to your life, if destiny permits it My new life has been decided But do you think Raguri should be the one to decide?
