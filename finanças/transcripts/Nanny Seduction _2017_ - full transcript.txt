Wonder what it could be. Nice! My children loved these when they were younger... I thought you might, too. That's very thoughtful. What do we tell Mrs. Gregory? Thank you. You're welcome. Well, go on, sweetheart, make a wish. I think it's time for Big Bad Dad to huff and to puff... and blow these candles out! There it goes. I'll get the rest. Wanna check out your books? Yeah, that's nice... yeah. Anything I can help with? No, I got it. I talked to my daughter yesterday. I told her if you needed more time to find someone... No, go spend time with your new granddaughter. I've got some interviews set up for tomorrow... I've gone through the resumes... I'm sure we'll have a replacement nanny by then. Not that you could ever be replaced. Okay, I've got cupcakes. Who wants one? Ben? No, thank you, I'm trying to watch my girlish figure. Chocolate or vanilla. Mrs. Gregory? Vanilla. Now we're talking. That's good. Let me get a picture of you guys. Something to remember you by. I'm going across town, not across the country. Still, it's not the same. You ready? One, two... Okay, get it this way. Looks like we got one more. What is it? I don't know, we'll have to see. - Who's it from? - No clue. I'm sure there's a card inside. Look at that. Riley, what a great doll. Wow! She looks just like you, Riley. No? I think she likes it. How'd it go? Well, a young girl discovers she's the child of magical... beings and saves the world from an impending evil. Which book was that? All of them. I, I let her know her gift was on the way. She's gonna love the bike, Ben, it'll be worth the wait. I... I know, I just feel bad that it wasn't ready for today. This account is eating away all my free time and... Well, she still looks at you like you hung the moon, so... you won't be in the doghouse for long. You okay? Yeah, I'm just tired. â–  We got another letter. We can't keep ignoring them. I know. What do you want to do? I don't know. Maybe we should just let her see Riley. The social worker told us this is an important time for us... to be developing a bond as a family... the three of us. I mean, don't you think this is just going to confuse her? Who am I to keep her from her mother? You are her mother, Kara. She still looks at me like I'm a stranger. No matter what I do, no matter what I say. We knew there were going to be complications... going into this adoption. Riley's been through a lot, and it's only been six months. Just give her some time. I know. And I would never pressure her, I just... I just feel like I should be doing more. Yeah. She'll come around. I mean, it's you, after all. What's not to love? "And Princess Molly went to the grand pal... pal..." Sound it out. Palace? That's it. Well, I plan to go for my early education degree next year... or maybe pursue child advocacy. I'm taking time off right now to decide. Impressive. And what would you say are your best qualities? Well, I like kids, I guess. Well, that's important. Here's a letter from my former employer... who talks about my punctuality and professionalism... and this is from my youth development professor... who notes my aptitude for reflective learning. Loyal, hardworking, CPR-certified. What about a car, a way to get around? Yep. Oil changed regularly, all tags up to date. I don't have one, but I could get one. Don't worry, I won't text and drive. Um, this is a full-time, live-in position. Is that something that you see... would fit into your life right now? I'm definitely looking for something more permanent. Thank you so much for coming. No, it's my pleasure. I'll be in touch. So, are we done here? I see that the only reference that you've listed... here is your father? Yeah, he, he said your husband would do anything... for his account, so he's the only reference I'd need. Okay, then. Sounds like it went well. Have you made your decision? It's down to two, but I'm leaning towards one. Well, this shouldn't take too long, maybe 20 minutes. Should we wait for Ben? No. Hey, thank you for leaving a plate out. Took the Burkes out to the Millstone. Of course. How was Kelcie? I don't know, Ben, she doesn't have very much experience... and she's kind of blunt. Well, honesty can be an admirable quality. Bob said she was great with kids. It's probably because she relates to them. Well, give Kelcie a chance for me. Hey, is this new? It is. I love it. Blue's my favorite color. So, you gonna tell me why you were late tonight? Yeah, I was out with clients. I told you that. Okay. It's part of my job, Kara, you know that. I believe you. Is this how it's gonna be? Every time I have a late night... you're gonna put me under the microscope. I didn't ask for this, Ben. I made a mistake. Are you ever going to forgive me for it? I have. You're a terrible liar. Well, that makes one of us. I've left a list of foods that Riley will eat. No allergies to worry about. If you have any problems, here is my cell and my husband's. Do you have any questions for me? What's your wifi password? 1-2-3-4. All right, Riley, I'm gonna go to work now. You be good for Miss Kelcie, okay? She's a little reserved. So, how is Riley? Good. She's still a little bit withdrawn... but Ben has been able to get her guard down a little. She'll get there. You remember what it's like. These kids need time to feel secure again. I guess I'm just worried that because I didn't have a mother.. Growing up, that I won't know how to be that for someone else. You and Ben are doing a wonderful job. Believe me, that little girl is very lucky to have you both. Thank you. You're a new mom, be prepared for a constant state of worry. I'm looking forward to it. I was hoping to talk to you about the letters... from Riley's birth mother. I had a feeling that's what this might be about. Does she want Riley back? The system doesn't work that way. You and your husband have legal custody. But, she would like a place in her life. I guess I just don't understand why she's reaching out now. Vanessa has been in counseling... um, she hasn't touched a drink in seven months... and she's working full-time now. It's... it's normal to be unsure. This is your decision to make. I think at this time, we'll have to decline. We'll let her know. Did she really say that? She's always been such an ass. You didn't hear that. No, not you, I'm nannying. No, I really am, I'll show you. Okay, I just sent you a picture. Did you get it? See I told you. Hey, I'm a responsible person. Bon appetite, kid. I know, it's all anybody's going to be talking about. I mean, she really screwed herself this time. Not literally. She screwed Jake literally. No, she doesn't know what that means. Do you know what that means? Yes. Aren't you gonna eat that? No. You know, this is the real entitlement generation. So, what do you want to do? Hide and seek? For real? All right. You hide first. Close your eyes. One, two, three... four, five, six... seven, eight... Nine, ten, 11... 12, 13, 14... 15, 16... 17, 18... 19, 20, 21... 22, 23, 24, 25... 26, 27, 28... 29, 30. Ready or not, here I come! Riley? DISPATCHER Helicopter assistance crew... police department for traffic control. DISPATCHER We have a fire in a structure. Riley! Riley, are you okay, honey? Are you Mrs. Turling? Yes. It was a very small fire... so you're looking at minimal damage. Don't let the trucks scare you. We have to respond this way to all alarms. Thank you. We're almost finished inside, so I'm gonna get started... on the paperwork for your insurance. Do you have any idea what might have caused it? It, um, it appears to have started on the stove. The stove? That can't be right. When we got here, the burner was turned all the way up. I'm so sorry. Sorry, got here as fast as I could. That's okay. Well, sounds like it could've been a lot worse. I wasn't even here and my life flashed before my eyes. It's just stuff. We'll get it all replaced. Yeah. And look for a new nanny. Yeah, looks like it. Hey, I'm sorry about last night. I've just been really stressed with this whole transition... and I didn't mean to take it out on you. You're... no, you're right, um... I could do a better job of checking in. I do trust you, Ben. Good, I don't plan on giving you a reason not to. Hey, did you talk to your mom? Ask if she sent Riley's doll, I want to send a thank you. No, I've been playing phone tag with her. I talked to my sister and she didn't send it... but she assures me a nice set of paints are in the mail. Good, maybe Riley can redo the cabinets. Right. Hello? Hello? That is the third time this week somebody's called and hung up. We both have cell phones, let's get rid of that line. The only people that call are telemarketers. I guess. Just with the calls and the letters... Hey, it's gonna be okay. Nothing to worry about. Except for grease fires, they're very dangerous. All right, I'm gonna go see what we're working with. On a scale of one to ten, what am I bracing myself for? An 11. Really? Okay, fine, a two, but a really traumatic two. Okay, well, you did say you want a new stove, so... Not like this. It's gonna be okay. Promise. We're so happy to have you here, Alyssa. Trust me, I was excited to get your call. You're staying in the guest room... but feel free to decorate it however you want. Just consider it yours. Thank you. My husband and I are really grateful that you're here. Our last nanny really felt like family... and we're hoping that you feel like that soon, too. Wow, what a lovely family. Thank you. So, this is your room right here. Right next to Riley's, Ben and I sleep downstairs. So, just take some time to settle in and come down... and I'll introduce you to Riley. Perfect. Riley? This is Miss Alyssa. Well, hello, Riley, I'm gonna be your new nanny. How does that sound? Well, who's this? It's a new birthday gift. Well, does she have a name? I think that she looks like an Alyssa. What do you think? That's your name. It is? No. Well, then I guess that you and I will have to come up... with a name for her together. Deal? Hey, are you up for a trip? I wanna show you one of Riley's favorite spots. This is a great place to bring Riley if you ever feel like... she's just got tons of energy. She'll just run herself ragged. She's a sweet girl. Yeah, we think so. She looks just like you. She's adopted actually. I was a foster kid, bounced around a lot of homes... it was hard. So, whenever I pictured motherhood... this is what I thought of. Giving a child the stability I never had. It was important to me. Well, it's not blood that makes family. We surround ourselves with the people that we love. That's family. Yeah. No, that was my grandmother's. Yes, was. Hey, charge it to your new account. Hey, can we get the adjuster in here this week? The sooner we can get this kitchen back to normal... the better. Some more bad news. Stove's on back order. So, it's the hot plate for the foreseeable future. Sorry to interrupt, we're just grabbing a drink. This is Alyssa. Alyssa, this is my husband, Ben. Nice to meet you. You as well... welcome to the team. Happy to be here. Ben, was it? Yeah. Okay, ready? She seems nice. Yeah, Riley really seems to like her. Well, I hope this one works out better than the last one. We can only go up from here. Kara? Kara? Hey, Jannette. Hey... I saw that fire truck yesterday and was just beside myself. Everyone's okay, it was just a small stove fire. I'm relieved to hear that. I had worried it had been... Been what? Well, you know I don't like to stick my nose... where it doesn't belong. Of course. But I saw someone outside your house the other day, young girl. She was walking up and down the path. Seemed nervous, it was very strange. I've been interviewing nannies... so, you probably just saw one of them. I'm sure that was it. Well, thanks. Yeah, I'm glad everyone's okay. I just have one more question... about what we talked about the other day. LORRAINE Sure. Riley's birth mom, she doesn't know anything about us, right? Where we live. LORRAINE No, well, of course not... all correspondence is done through the agency. Yeah, I'm probably just being... Thank you so much for all of your help. LORRAINE Not a problem. Okay, bye. Is everything okay? Yeah, just with the fire and all the change... I just want to make sure I've dotted all my "I's"... and crossed all my "t's", so to speak. Absolutely. One more thing. If you notice something strange, will you tell me? Strange, how? Just if something doesn't seem right. Of course. Don't worry, I'll look after Riley like she's my very own. Hey. Hey. That looks great. We're getting there. These are cute. I think you should get a matching pair for your bike. You joke, but... Okay, well, that is just adorable. So, what's up? Um, the insurance adjuster called... and he's just running a little late today, so... I'm just thinking we're burning daylight. You guys should just go to the beach without me. I'll meet you later. Well, why don't we just do it another day? No, she's been looking forward to this for weeks. And so have you. If we hadn't adopted her in December... that's the first place you would have taken her. I tried, you stopped me. It was 32 degrees and snowing, Ben. I just... I don't want to disappoint her. I think you not being there would disappoint her more. I won't be long. Okay, you sure? Positive. All right. Carry on. You and Dad are gonna head to the beach without me, okay? Okay. I'm gonna be right behind you guys, I promise. Okay, kiddo, have a great time. Build a sand castle for me. It's been ages since I played in the sand. Can Miss Alyssa come to the beach? Riley, it's her day off. Please? Well, I wouldn't want to impose. No, not at all. It might be nice to have a second set of eyes there. Unless you already have plans. Are you sure? I know that this was a family thing. Well, you'll be family soon enough. Right? All right, guys, piÃ±a colada snowballs. There's one for you, for you. I wanted strawberry. You're gonna love that one, I promise. PiÃ±a colada always reminds me of being on vacation... or on an island. Do you know how to swim, Riley? She takes lessons at the Y. You know, I grew up by the water, right up the coast. Really? Yeah. Yep, and when my parents moved away, they left the house to me. If you follow the shoreline for a very long time... you'll come to a little town called, Cradle Bay. Cool. Just over the bridge, there's a little cove hiding... way back there and that's where I grew up. Maybe I'll show it to you someday. How about that? I'll put the stick in the tower. Great. That's perfect. Here, let me help. That's okay, I got it. Come on, or you'll wind up with a racing stripe down your back. Yeah, I think it's pretty covered, thanks. Looking good, Riles. All right, we gonna build that mote? Or we could go swimming. Um, yeah, you know, I was kind of hoping we'd wait for Kara. She'd... she'd want to be here for that. It's like 90 degrees and we've been baking in the sun all day. I don't think she's gonna make it. You've kept her on the sand the whole time... you brought her here for the ocean, she wants to try. Don't you wanna try, Riley? Yeah! Come on, Dad. Okay. Ready for the big moment? Ready. All right, let's go. Hey, Ben, the adjuster never showed... so I'm just gonna reschedule for another day. I really don't want to miss Riley's first time in the water. So, stall for me, would ya? I'll see you soon. Bye. Hi, can I help you? Are you... are you Kara Turling? Yes. My name is Vanessa Shaw. I'm Riley's mother. I just came to talk. You haven't responded to any of my letters. How did you find out where I live? I've been working really hard on getting better... for her. I love her. You've been calling, haven't you? Hanging up, that was you? I was trying to get up the nerve. I've imagined this conversation a million times. You need to leave. Please, I just want to be part of her life. Then maybe you should have put her first. I made some mistakes. You were a danger to yourself and to Riley. I never had the fire department come to my house. How do you know about that? It doesn't matter. What do you want from us? I wanna see my daughter. We need to memorialize this. Hey. Here. Cheese! Can you say, "cheese"? Cheese! Can you say, "cheese"? Do you mind taking a photo of us? Yeah, sure. Let's take a picture. Aw, you guys make such a cute family. All right, together! We're not really a fam... Aw, come on, Ben, it's just a picture. One, two and... cheese! Perfect. Thank you. Hey! Sorry we missed you. What's wrong? Let's go find a jar for your shells. What's wrong? You're starting to scare me a little bit. She was here? Who? Riley's birth mother. She just showed up on our doorstep. What... what did she want? What do you think? Did you have fun at the beach today? I really wish I could have been there... but I'll plan something fun really soon. Just for the two of us, okay? You promised. I know, I'm really sorry. All right, Riley, I found them. Hi. We were just gonna do some coloring. Did you want to join us? You two go ahead. Okay... so, what color do you want to start with? Ooh, how about red? I like green. Excellent choice. I'll call the adoption agency in the morning. I don't want you on edge about this. I just wasn't expecting it, that's all. Of course not, this is supposed to be confidential. I'd like to know how she even found out. Well, she seems very persistent. You know, there's nothing she can do, right? Kara? I can't lose her, Ben. And you won't. She's ours. Can we just leave this alone for right now? Yeah. How did she do? She did great. Look, she's like a fish. Maybe we should get a pool or something. That looks great. Here, do you want to see mine? What is it? Well, that's my house. The one I was telling you about today at the beach. And there's the water and there's you, Riley... and your dad and do you know who this is? Mom? No, no. That's me. You, me, Daddy. You, me, Daddy. Yeah. I assure you, we don't normally eat like this. We do, on occasion, feed our child a vegetable. Well, I guess there are always the tomatoes in the sauce. Tomatoes are a fruit. Really? Yeah, there's all kinds of strange rules... like a strawberry isn't a berry, but you know what is? A banana. Well, that doesn't even make sense. Yeah, it's funny, we think things are a certain way... when they're really much, much different. So, Alyssa, how are you settling in? I'm very comfortable. Good. Can I have some more milk, please? I'll, um... I'll get it. Who's ready for another slice? What has gotten into you? I've missed you. Do you want me to stop? No. I miss you, too. Daddy! I'll go get her. No, I'll go. So, you had a nightmare? Yeah. It's okay, nothing can hurt you. Alyssa? I heard her call out for her dad... so I just wanted to make sure she's okay. I've got it from here. Okay, feel better, Riley. Goodnight. Hey, sweetie, did you have a bad dream? Where's Daddy? He's in the bed. Do you want to tell me what's wrong? I'm scared. Well, there's nothing in here. Unless... is this guy giving you a hard time? Do you want me to stay with you until you go to sleep? Yeah. How about I sing you a song? Can you sing to her? She gets scared at night, too. Sure. You never have to be scared, Riley, I'll always protect you. Looking a little flush, Ben. Just thirsty. What the hell were you doing at the dinner table tonight? Having dinner with my new family. You know what, I don't think this is gonna work out. It's not the right position for you. Do you have another position in mind? Look, I don't know what kind of games you're playing... but I'm a happily married man. You weren't a year ago. Excuse me? Do you really not remember me? That hurts my feelings, Ben... because I could never forget you. Here, let me refresh your memory. It was a crowded bar in the city, I sent you a drink. I was wearing a blue dress, you said it brought out my eyes. We shared a cab ride home... but when we got to my place, you never left. That girl was blonde. That girl was me. There we go. What the hell are you doing here? How did you find me? I thought you'd be happy to see me. You knew we had... You've been living here this whole time, are you crazy? Don't call me that. Fine. You're delusional. That's not what you said that night. To be honest, I don't remember what I said that night... because it was one night, a year ago. Do you know how hard I've worked on my marriage? If Kara ever found out... Well, then, I guess you don't want her finding out... now, do you? What do you want from me? You're fine, it's okay. I'm right here. I'll catch you, I won't let you fall. It's okay, you got this, you're fine. Slide down. Hurry up! Can you guys let her through, please? It's okay, honey... it's okay. Um... why don't you go play on the swings... for a little while, okay? Are you following us now? She always was afraid of heights. Please don't make me call the authorities. I just wanted to see her. I'll stay here. Then we're leaving. You won't even give me this? I'm not even talking to her. You don't understand what's it's been like for me. No, what I don't understand is how you could have someone... like Riley and make the choices that you did. I've forgiven myself, hopefully she can, too. You can't keep me away from her forever. Riley, we're leaving, come on, let's go! Come on! Thought you might be thirsty. I'm not. Come on... it's fresh squeezed! If you're going to stay here, we need to set some ground rules. â–  Well, you're the boss, boss. No more flirting. In fact, we don't even need to talk, period. Understand? I do. What are you doing? Not talking. Please stop. Please stop. No, I don't want to stop... and I don't think you want me to, either. I do... stop, please. Stop it. Please stop! You need to stop. Do you remember what you said to me that night... that we were together? No. You said that we were good together, and we are, Ben. I was drunk, stop it! I was out of my mind, I was in a terrible place. No... I've seen the way that you look at me. Your eyes follow me wherever I go. That's not true. I came here to show you how well we fit together. That day at the beach, it was effortless. We could have that all the time, that could be our lives. You, me, Riley, we could be a family. You've seen us, how well we work. No. What a great mother I can be. You are not her mother! Don't fight this, Ben. Don't deny us the happiness that we deserve. I'm married! But you don't have to be. I want to be. That's what you don't seem to understand. It's not you or her, it is just her. I choose Kara every time. You don't really mean that. Let me show you. You're going home. I am home. You're not, this is my home, mine and Kara's. I'm not gonna let you destroy it. You made me promises, Ben. "I'd love to take you away, go somewhere, just escape it all." I was drunk, Alyssa, that's not a promise. You can't just take it back. I gave up everything to come here, my job, my life... I left it all behind for you. You're insane. You're absolutely insane. No... we could be so happy together. No, we can't. Please,. Don't... don't touch me. Don't! I want you to leave... now. You're making a big mistake. No... I'm fixing one. Wait, wait, wait! I've got a little surprise for you. I'm not really in the mood for surprises. Why not? I don't want to go into it right now. Okay, well, maybe I have something that'll brighten up... your day just a little bit. Tah-dah! How... I made a couple phone calls, had the guy put it in today. We still have to call the contractor, though. It's perfect. Did the stove guy bring the flowers, too? No, that was all me. Somebody's been busy. I wanted to do something nice for you. Thank you. You're welcome. Where's Riley? She's outside playing. Hey, maybe we could get Alyssa to take Riley... for some ice cream tonight... so you and I could have some time to... She's gone. What do you mean? She had a family emergency, so, she had to leave. Well, when will she be back? She won't. Well, I hope everything's okay. Should I call her? No, she, she's got a lot to deal with, so... give her her space. Okay. Do I have to wait to use this or can I go right now? You do not, go ahead. What do you want me to make you? Pancakes. "And all of the frogs lived happily ever after." The end. Okay, goodnight. Where's Miss Alyssa? Alyssa had to go away for a little while. Was I bad? No, honey, of course not. Miss Alyssa did not go away because you were bad... she liked you very, very much, okay? And it's okay to miss her. Goodnight, I love you. Thank you. I'm sorry this transition has been such a rocky one. I knew it was gonna be tough to fill your shoes... but I didn't realize it was going to be quite this tough. Well, I'm always available to lend an ear. I'm just so happy you stopped by. It really has not been the same without you. How's your grandbaby? Precious. I think she looks like me. You know, I forgot what taking care of a baby was like... it's exhausting. Well, these are lovely. A gift from the mister. I take it things are going better? Ben has been really attentive lately. For the first time in a long time... I feel like things are going to be okay. I'm so glad to hear it. I have to tell you, my grandson, Tyler... did the funniest thing the other day. You know how he loves to do puzzles, well... Kara, is something wrong? I'll be right back. Hey, how's it going? Good. What's this one about? A girl like me. Really? How is she like you? She doesn't have a home. You do have a home... here. Until it's time to go. Riley, you're gonna be with us forever. Okay? Hey, you know what I'm thinking? It is such a beautiful day out. Maybe I should make us a lunch and we can go to the beach... just you and me... how's that sound? Yeah! Hey, who were you talking to out here? She... told me not to tell you. Who told you not to tell? Was it a stranger? I was just... playing with my doll. Are you mad? No. No, sweetie, I'm not mad. Just promise me, if somebody that you don't know... tries to talk to you, you will tell me. Okay? Okay. Come on. You know, I never told you this before... but you and I have something in common. What? I didn't have a home growing up, either. I lived a lot of different places. It's not so much fun, is it? No. That's over now, okay? You never have to worry about that again. Look at this one. I bet if you hold it up to your ear, you can hear the ocean. Here, try it. You hear it? I do. It's pretty cool? Yeah, Miss Alyssa showed me that last time. Kara? Kara? You can join me if you want. Hey. Why didn't you join me? Where? The shower. Well, I would have, but I just got home. Rain check? Yeah, yeah, I... Hey... hold that thought. Riley just tracked sand all the way to the bedroom. "And she knew that her friends would always be there... "and for that, she was forever grateful." The end. All she wrote, kiddo. Can we read another one? Not tonight, Riley. Please! It's the face, I'm caving, okay... Okay. It's already past your bedtime, but tomorrow... maybe we can go to the library... and get the next book in the series? How does that sound? Yeah. Yeah. What? I'm invested. Hey, did you come up with a name for this little girl yet? I'm deciding between two. What are they? Princess Katarina Featherstone... Or? Anne. I vote Anne. You're serious? Clearly this is a Princess Katarina Featherstone. Okay, goodnight, Riley. Goodnight, kiddo. Your Highness. We'll see you tomorrow, okay? Both my girls, always with your nose in a book. How was the beach? Nice. Yeah? It was... good. But? I'm just worried that she doesn't understand... that this is permanent. â–  That she thinks she could be taken away again at any moment. Okay. How do you want to fix that? Maybe I should take some time away from work. Nah, we've already gone over that. Well, I don't know what else to do. I know exactly how she feels and it sucks. All you want is to know that you have a real family... and a real home. That's exactly what she does have. Kids don't understand promotions and contracts and 401k's. They only know if you're there or if you're not. â–  I don't want all of Riley's best memories to be with a nanny. I know. She's a smart girl and she's coming out of her shell. I see it everyday. And she's gonna be so thankful we were loving parents... and worked hard to give her the best life possible. I hope you're right. I am. Riley loves you... and so do I. Shh. Come on, kiddo, time to get up. Hey, time to get... Kara? She's not in her room. Her bed's empty. That's strange, I didn't hear her get up. Are you sure? Yeah. Okay... okay, well, she has to be somewhere... so let's just look around. Riley? Riley? Riley? Riley? Riley, honey, come out. Riley? Riley, this isn't funny, where are you? Riley! Riley! Riley! Riley! Riley! Riley! Kara? Anything? No. God. Ben? Okay. Ben? Okay. When was the last time you saw your daughter? Last night, 8:30, we put her to bed. And when did you notice she was missing? I went to her bedroom... it was... 7:00. Her bed was empty and I searched the house, searched the yard. We talked to the neighbors. I have no idea where she could be. Now, has she ever done anything like this before? Sneak out of the house, or... She's eight! Kara, it's okay. Give us one second? Sit down, sit down. God. He's here to help us. What if she did run away? What if this never felt like home to her, so she just left? I don't believe that for one second. It's gonna be okay. We're going to find her, okay? You like it? Where are we? Remember that house that I was telling you about... where I grew up? Well, this is it. Come on. I don't want to be here. Aw, don't say that. I think you're really gonna like it here. Wait, where's my mommy and daddy? It's like hide-and-seek. You like hide-and-seek, right? We're gonna hide out here and wait for your daddy to find us. You haven't seen her? We're just asking everyone to keep an eye out for her. Okay, thank you. Come in. Anything? We spoke with Miss Shaw... and she has no knowledge of your daughter's whereabouts. She's lying. She spent the night at her mother's house... and she has multiple family members... who corroborate her story. She let us into her home, willingly... and we didn't find anything to suggest... your daughter had been there. Okay, so... so what happens now? All right, well, we have officers out looking... and we've issued a public alert. Trust me, we are taking this very seriously. Exploring every possibility. What do we do? Is there anyone else that you can think of... that we should check out? Yes. There's something I have to tell you. Riley? Where are you going? Outside. To play. Without me? You said there was a lake, I just wanted to see. We can go see that later. Right now I need you to stay inside with me, okay? When's my daddy coming? He actually just called. He's on his way right now. Here, chocolate milk. I don't like chocolate milk. Aw, you will like mine, I use extra syrup. I made it special for you. It's not polite to refuse a kind gesture from a friend. We are still friends, right? Good. Here, I wanna show you something. Come on. This was my room growing up. Do you want to read a book while we wait? Here, climb on. I'm too big. Yeah, you're right, those are for babies. You're a big girl. Don't touch those! Sorry, it's just that they're very special. I can introduce you, if you like? Okay, well, this is Katherine Jean... she's a Duchess and she lives in a giant palace in the sky. And this is Maybelle... she wants to be a veterinarian when she grows up. And Bethanne, she loves horses, she has three. And this is Betty. She's a survivor. She's had a tough life, but a smile never leaves her face. She's my favorite. Don't worry, I'm sure that they'll all get along just fine. No, looks like there isn't any room. Well, I guess somebody will have to go then. I... Kara, I'm so sorry. Can you look at me, please? Kara, this was one time. Since she's been here? No, no, Kara, this was a year ago! Back when things were terrible. Before we spoke, before we decided to fix everything. How could you let her move into our house, Ben? Did you... did you want to be with her? Of course... no! I... I didn't even know who she was. I was terrified of losing your trust. I didn't want to lose everything that we had worked so hard for. I cannot believe this. She came on to me, while you were gone, and I fired her. She didn't have a family emergency. And you didn't think to tell me this? Kara, I wanted her gone, I wanted her out of our house. I had no idea she could be dangerous. The police are out there searching for our daughter, Ben. If they have spent all of this time on the wrong person. I... I know, I know, I am so sorry. Please don't forget how hard we've worked. You know me, you know I've changed. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. We're gonna find her, I promise you. I love you. I need a minute. Okay? Okay. Kara? I think I know where she is. Her family has a house up the coast. Do you think you know how to get there? I think so. I just talked to the police, is it true? Is she missing? This is Vanessa... Shaw. Did you come to rub it in my face? To let me know what a horrible mother I am? No, I came to help. I'm sorry for how things went with us, I was angry... but the most important thing is Riley... right? We think we know where she is. Is there any way you could stay here, in case something happens? In case she comes back? Yeah, I can... We have to go. I can do that. Thank you. Your daddy should be here soon. Feel free to unpack your things... I cleared the drawers out for you. Why are we here? Well, this is your new home, Riley. My new home? Well, you didn't think that you were going to live... with the Turlings forever, did you? That's what my mom said. You mean Kara? She wasn't telling you the truth. See, I know what it's like to have people lie to you... to promise you things and then toss you aside. Doesn't feel good, does it? No. You can't depend on others to help you. If someone isn't giving you the happiness that you deserve... sometimes you have to take it. You understand? Not really. Well, don't worry, you will. I'll be the best mom that you ever had and I'll never leave. But you did leave. But I came back, didn't I? For you? Now I'm here to stay. Okay, your turn. Alyssa? Olly-olly-oxen-free. He found us. He did. And now we're gonna play a new game, okay? But I want to see him. You'll see him soon enough. This game is called Captive. You've been kidnapped by an evil dragon... and your daddy and I have to come and save you. But dragons can't tie knots. It's pretend. Now you wait right here and don't make a sound. Okay? Shh. Alyssa, are you there?! It's me, I... I'm alone. Alyssa? Alyssa, are you there? Alyssa? Alyssa, it's me. I left Kara. You were right. You were right. May I come in? Where's Riley? You left her? For good? Yes. I couldn't be there anymore. It felt like a lie. Because it was a lie, Ben. I know. I know, you... You made me see that. Of course, it would've been a lot easier... if you'd thrown her out of the house. It took you leaving to make me realize that. Do we really need this? I'm still deciding. Where will we live? Live? Your house? Sure. Yeah, we can lie at my house or we can live here. It's nice. Just me, you and Riley... a family. Is this your family? Yes. That was my father's dog. He loved that dog. One day, I was playing outside and a truck backfired... and it must have scared him. Next thing I knew, he had my arm in his teeth. I just remember screaming and seeing blood. My father told the police that it was the neighbor's dog... that attacked me. They put that dog down the next day. He said, "Alyssa, he's a good dog, he just made a mistake." That's awful. It was... until I found out where my father kept the rat poison. It's okay, you don't have to be scared. Do you want me to sing to you? I can't believe that we're finally together. You can believe it. Okay... then kiss me. Close your eyes. If you want my trust, I need to know that I have yours. Close your eyes. See, I knew that you still loved me. Of course, I do. Can we go get Riley? Riley, Riley. Mama! Riley. Can you get to me? No. Wiggle your wrists like this. Good girl, good girl. Now lift up and pull. You got it, baby, pull it out, pull it out! So close. You got it! Okay, good, come unlock the door. Come unlock... Unlock the door, baby, hurry, hurry... No, no, no, no! No! Now, I need you to be very, very quiet. If you don't, someone might get hurt... and you don't want that, right? Riley? Riley? You know, I'm so glad that you like your doll. I knew it was the perfect gift when I saw it. â–  Now, wait right here. Hey. My god, Ben, I heard that gunshot... Shh. I thought you were... I'm okay. Maybe you are a terrible liar. Where's Riley? She's got her. Here, hold this tight, okay. Okay. No, stop. She's out of her mind. Ben, she has got our little girl. What are we gonna do? Now wait right here and be quiet. Riley... come out, come out wherever you are. I wonder where she could be hiding. Riley! I'll get her. Wait, wait. Help me up. Let me come with you. Okay. No, no, no, wait, wait, look at me. I've got an idea. Okay. Help! Aw, does that hurt, Ben? Well, you shouldn't play... with a girl's heart! Get off! Riley. Okay. Riley! Riley! Daddy? Riley, my god, baby! Did she hurt you? You sure? Promise? Kara, she's in here! My god, thank god! We're here now, you're safe, it's okay. You found me. We will always find you. You know, the Mommy and Me classes... have been going really great. The gossip is fantastic. Did you know Sarah Morton... had a tummy tuck? Are you sure you're okay with this? Yeah, I mean it's her body, she could do... You know what I mean. Are you sure you're okay taking time off of work... to take care of Riley? Work will be there for whenever we decide I should go back. Right now, this is what's important... new house, new start. I would apologize, but I won't. Okay, I get that. It's going really well. Yeah, I think so. I know I had my reservations... but it's important they have a relationship. I'm really proud of you. I just want what's best for her. I'm her mother. Yeah... that's exactly what you are. Mama! Come on, Riley, I got ya!
