We're not set up to break you. We're here to rehabilitate. But ultimately, it's up to you how it plays out. You've had plenty of time in solitary to think about how we want you to behave. But again, I can only strongly suggest that in the end, it all lies with you. You have certain choices. Others have to be made for you. This one, for instance. A new cellmate. You can't live a solitary life in the way that you necessarily want. You have to acknowledge that you have a debt to pay society and it will be paid in the manner we choose. Good behaviour. You've given your counsellor your word. Keep it. Last chance. Be nice. Bottom shelf, Wainwright, yeah? Get it sorted. She's ready. Committed. There are a few rudimentary but necessary amendments to the paperwork, but once they're cleared, it's up to you. Your decision is the final one. I want you to understand that, Steve. This will not happen unless you clear it. If you're not ready, if you're not comfortable, we can postpone indefinitely, if need be. Twenty years is a long time. She's a woman now. From what we know, she claims she doesn't expect anything from you. It's just about her closure. Her forgiveness, perhaps. But she may be looking for something more than she's confiding in us. She may be angry. She may want answers. I need you to have an inkling of how you feel before you subject yourself to the situation. How you want it to pan out. But you should know there is a possibility that Karen's mother could be there. Steve? We know you're a fucking grass! You're a fucking dead man! You're fucked! Boys! - You're fucked! - Boys! Thanks for the tea. The showers that way? Scotty Turnbull's in the southeast! Psst! Come here. Marcus Wainwright? - Yeah. - I know your cousin, Ifbra. - Yeah? - Yeah. Good geezer. You stand like a hard-man, don't ya? All puffy chest. You a hard-man, son? - I ain't after... - After what? Eh? You can hold of yourself, can ya? This ain't no fuckin' street fight no more, kid. You're on the fuckin' wing now. Your cousin can, hold himself. I'm good. What? - I'm good, man. - You're good? You puttin' on me? You offerin' a poof cunt? - You're fuckin' dead now. - Don't you fucking move. All right, all right! Let it lie, let it lie. Sorry, Steve. Sorry, okay? It's me and him, man. His cousin's a grass. That's all I got. That's it. Don't you ever fuckin' bring it here, you understand me? Do you fucking understand me? Yes. Now fuck off. Yeah. That was all him. All him. - We all good? - Yeah. So, how is he? He's green. Tell him to get it down on the early. Might be beneficial. He probably wants the wing, Scotty. Have a tool handy. Don't do the walkabout with it, because you'll get a random and then you're in the hole. Have one stashed. If someone makes a move, you'll get a mark or two. Just keep them away from the vitals. If you're tooled up, at least one of you is going to the burner. But chances are you'll take a sting and you'll get out of it. Let it settle, then have your go. Chances are slim that you'll keep out the lineup. So use it, knowing that you'll have to be okay with your own company for a bit. But the mug you want will be off guard. That's the time to take him. Up! Fuck. What time is it? 6:30. Get up! Breakfast at seven? You sleep deep for a new boot. Up! What's the breakfast like here? How long'd they give ya? Seven. You'll be sick of it in two. What, was you armed, yeah? Yeah. They threw assault at me. Was it worth it? Is it ever? It is, if it's an earner. Ten large. Well, there's your answer. Bird's a cunt, right? Everyone around here. Everyone in here. And everyone who runs, controls, and visits. All cunts, yeah. You just gotta decide early on what type of cunt you wanna be. I ain't a funny cunt. There are two types of inmates. Someone that the courts are mad at, so they throw him a sentence. To me, well, they're half the fuckin' problem. Should've been given cleanup duty on the M25 for six months. Stop anyone from acting up. Instead, it costs them 100 grand up, just to keep them in a ten-by-eight. The other is someone who is a danger to society. Those are the ones who deserve to be here. Locked in, locked up. I deserve to be here and by the sounds of it, so do you. Know that. You know that and you're halfway done. Suss it out. Get a feel for the place. There's plenty to keep your mind right. Plenty of places to find the poison. But if you wanna do it right, once you're legit, ask away. You don't have to be a cunt in this cell. Use common sense if you need to take a smash. Always check it first. Make sure there's nothing being stored. Shit when I'm not here and I'll do the same. We're not animals. Look out for me and I'll look out for you. Deserve it? I won't bring it in here. What? I need to shit. Wait till the morning. I don't know if I can though, man. You will. Lights out! The fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? - Please! - Dirty cunt! Are you a fucking animal? Eh? You fucking listen to me! You listen to me! Get your fuckin' head down there. What're you doin', man? What're you doin'? Filthy little cunt! You dirty, rodent cunt! Fucking dirty... I see you hesitate, I'll take you down. I knew it was a strong hit by the colour of his blood. You come at me with your aggression, you come at me with your bottle, you have to fuck me off, otherwise I'm gonna come on, and I'm gonna end you. I will stab the shit out of you until you stop moving. Incarcerate a toe-rag and turn him into a dangerous man. Incarcerate a dangerous man? Well, this is your doing. Here. Hands behind your back, Mackelson. Where is it, Steve? Did you flush it? The cunt flushed it. Got an inmate with half a fuckin' nose out there! I couldn't care less how he feels about that, but I will lock you up for the fuckin' peace, do you hear me? Where is it? I ain't got nothing. Okay. Okay, chuck him in. You see who did it? No. You were standing right there. You've started early, haven't you? Fuckin' shit breeds quickly in here, eh? I know one of you two chomped his nose. I didn't do anything, sir. Well, one of you did. If you didn't, did he? Nah, he was with me. I just heard it kick off. Don't even fuckin' bother, okay? Your friend here, he's done a lot of his bird in solitary so we know he can take it. But can you, hm? 'Cause if I don't get an answer from either one of yous, you're the one taking the fall. You've got ten seconds to tell us, or get yourself ready for an hour's recce, a day, for the next three months. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Oh, you know what? Fuck it, get him out of here. You're really gonna let him take that? What a fuckin' man. Closing 1887! Of course, it's concerning. Is this something you don't want, Steve? 'Cause if that's the case, if there are any more incidents, allegations, any reports... Yeah? They'll do what? - Then we call it quits. - This is a way of life. I chose it. I live it and I accept it. Allegations are just that. Alleged. You won't sit opposite... And you'll never hear me admit it. I took Scotty's nose off, yeah. Is that understood? And I'll take his fucking throat out next time, if he don't drop it. The courts will take this into consideration when they are reviewing your... Consideration. They wanna stop her from seeing me. Well, let 'em. I'm here and this is it. I don't get a parole hearing. - Are we clear? - I don't get a release date. I'll die in here. - No more incidents. - I'm up against it. A bird cage story. So they can do whatever they fucking please. - Now... - Yeah, I done her. Took the life right out of her. An act so vile, but I did it, just like that. It's amazing how easy it was. No more incidents. You think you know my crimes. You don't. You know I killed her and that cunt she left me for, but you don't know how, you don't wanna know how. You can't take it to know how. See you then, Steve. Don't tell me not to defend and survive in a place where my life can end in an instant. Don't pretend to understand that. Because the truth is, this is all their doing. Yours. Mine. Ours. You mix violence with violence, you watch for the outcome. I mean, what do you expect? You take away a man's civility and he adjusts to it. Yeah, you keep him locked up. Good for you. You keep smiling at the monsters that you create. 'Cause eventually they're gonna fucking chew you to the bone. She wants to meet with me? Fine. She doesn't get to? No skin off my nose. Wainwright's behaviour needs constant monitoring. Seems he feels unheard, unsafe. His father has issued a complaint into the blackmail allegations he's been receiving from Scott Turnbull's family members, seemingly offering their coercion as protection from gang-affiliated inmates. Unfortunately, these things do take time to investigate and that time only puts his son in further danger. For now, keep him segregated. Let's make Mr. Mackelson understand that we are the only ones who can offer full protection on the inside, and that his indemnity's no longer needed. Our rules, our discipline. And make it stick. We told you to fucking behave. Night night, sweetheart. All cunts, the lot of them. All on the fucking take. I'll have every fucking one of ya. It's wild in there. It'll make a man out of you, but still... Thanks, Steve. I know why you let 'em put me in there. Is he out? No, transferred. But it won't be done with Scotty, though. Yeah, I know. They got to you. It was coming, with or without ya. It was a muscle move. I ain't holdin' onto it. Yeah. Thanks. She wants you to have these. Again, your choice to view them or not. Unfortunately, you can't keep 'em, but, feel free to rifle through. They're how she appears currently. And there are pictures of her child. Your grandchild. Different people, different reactions. You may not feel anything when you look at her face, having not known her, but sometimes they stir up emotions that are biological. How do you feel? How much does she know? Everything. I'm not entirely sure if every detail has been discussed, but she knows the case and the sentencing. Do you think it's important she knows the details? To who? Well, I'd like to know if I was meeting a monster. Is that how you see yourself? Does that matter? That's how most perceive me. Twenty years ago, maybe. She knows what I did. Are you telling me she's never been curious as to how? I'm not sure she would want to know those details. Well, I would. Right, well, she's her own person. Yeah, but she's done her work, she's done her research. Perhaps. Does that make you feel uneasy? Do you? Do I what? What I just said. Do you feel uneasy, knowing what I did? - Are you suggesting I should? - No. I'm just saying, you know, being a woman. How do you feel, being around a man who committed such a horrendous crime? How about I keep my feelings to myself? They're not important and we are off topic. No, we're not. 'Cause we're talking about a 20-year-old girl who wants to meet her father, who butchered her mother while she slept in the same house. And you're a 30-year-old woman who's now spending time with that man, one on one, 20 years later. And I'm curious to know the depths of your feelings, so that I can navigate the depths of hers. Have you got any interest? No. These things usually bring both parties closure, Steve. Being forgiven can release you of many burdens. If you have any questions, relay them to your SO, and I will do my best to get them answered. Psst! Bounce brother. There are certain things you need to keep your bead on. On a calm day, everyone has their comforts on. You start to see trainers laced up, it's coming. Broken glass and broken bones hurt less when you've got your leather on. So, if you have to strap up, know you're going toe-to-toe. Do what you have to. Survive how you can. Just know that anything that's brought in here has risks. Someone will sniff it out and wanna turn you over. This is our Wailing Wall, our Geneva Convention. Throw down anywhere you like, but leave this place be. Leave this place be. Your safety is a concern of ours. As are the ongoing retaliations that I'm sure are imminent. Can we rule out another attack? I ain't worried. I'm sure. Well, we can't take that risk. We're transferring you to segregation, until this whole thing calms down. What about the boy? He'll adjust on his own. It's a life he has to experience. It isn't about his safety and it isn't about yours, either. It's about theirs, Mr. Mackelson. I need you to take a beat and let this simmer. Then I'm the mug, yeah? Going to the hole for them cunts. It don't simmer a man. It only begins to boil. Just remove the bedding, Marcus. We need to come inside, mate. Look, you fucking tell the governor I won't move and if any of you try to come, if any of you fucking try it... - Marcus... - Fuck that! I'll open you up! I'll open you up, I'm fucking telling you! - Pricks! - Just remove your bedding. Make sure you're not injured. And that it's safe for us to come in and talk, okay? Fuck off! You come in, I'm telling you, if you fucking come in, I'll open you up, I'll open you up. So you get the fucking governor down here now! The governor's on his way, son. Just remove the shield, come on. The fuck are you on about, man? Fuck! We can talk this out, all right, Marcus? Come on, just open the door, please. - You come in- - Come on, open the door! Fuck that! You can't, fuck you, you can fuck off, yeah? I will stab the first one who enters, yeah? Fucking test me. Fucking test me. What's going on? Marcus. It's Steve. Steve. You gotta act out to get me out of solitary? Sorry, man, I didn't mean for them... Don't be sorry. It's good to stretch. - They want me to talk you down. - Nah, man. If I open these doors, I'll be back on the wing in a month. Listen to me, at this rate, you're gonna be my neighbour for the rest of the year. Come on, kid. Look, they want you to take down them sheets. No, I ain't doin' this, Steve, man. They ain't helping me, so I ain't making it easy for them. What's going on? Lost my fucking mind ever since you've been gone, man. I'm on lockdown most of the fucking time today 'cause I'm a fucking target! - For who? - The usual pricks, man! Look, I need a transfer. I need a transfer. My dad is dishing out a bag a month to them, and he can't afford it. And the boy don't give a fuck, so I've gotta make a move. - Steve? - I'm here. I'm just asking this lot if it's true. Of course, it's fuckin' true, man! Of course, it's fuckin' true, man! I'm watching myself every day in here, Steve. I'm taking a hiding and my dad is getting threats. And these pricks ain't doing nothing to help nothing! Do you wanna let me in? I can't, man. It's so fucked. Listen, mate. You have to do this, all right? The governor ain't coming in. These fucking rules means he can't bend them. He shows up for you, the next geezer's gonna throw his lug. - What's he doing? - Eh? - What's he doing? - I'm fucked if I know. Marcus. How do you see this playing out, pal? He's gone mute. Marcus, open it up, will ya? Open it up. Marcus, I'm coming in. And I'm fucking warning ya, you chuck piss on me, I'm gonna knock you fucking spark out. Fuck, fuck. No, no, no, no, no! He'll be back once his medical evaluations are complete. A week or two. Think we can count on you, Steve? He feels safer with you around. Maybe this could be your calling, Mr. Mackelson. Looking out for him does not mean causing others harm. It does not give you any power. But perhaps starts the paying off your debts to our society. Can you be forgiven? Of course. Trusted? Well... We shall see. - You wanted a word? - Yeah. Thanks for coming. Sit down. Do me a favour and leave him alone. What are you, his old man? Kid's got a seven stretch. He can be done in four. He's got no weight on your game. Let it slide. He gets gear bought in, he's up against me. He gets fucking gear off of one of your lot. Then you turn him over. The kid's getting double fucked. Oh, it's funny, yeah? Look, bruv. He knows how it goes, you know how it goes. The fucking SOs know how it goes. You gotta earn your muscle. He gives Scotty the push, he's gotta have accountability. I'm asking you to leave it be. - Why should I? - Because I'm asking ya. You're a geezer, Steve, I respect you, bruv, but this, this ain't about you. This ain't for you, blood. I'm asking you to leave it alone. And I am telling you as nicely as I'm willing to be. He gets up on my business, then he's gotta take the cons. Who's putting the squeeze on his old man? Someone's gotta big mouth. Look, Danny, you know me. You know where I'm from. A long time ago, Steve. Things change. I know, but I still know the flats. I'm sure you do but everyone you knew left with the fires. The old block of tenements went up and now with the rebuild, it's looking like the fucking docklands, so no, I don't think anyone there told you about the extortion from Papa. I think you're trying to protect a grass. I told you. I came here out of respect for you, Stevie. But I got no debt to you. I got no fear. You love to carve people up, that used to go a long way, but I've got as much bottle and my fear factor is fuckin' zilch. Your reputation, it deserves a conversation, but when it's affecting my business, or slowing my days, you ain't gonna fuckin' hear what you want to. How old are you now? That don't even fuckin' matter. Stand up. Nah. - I said stand up. - Why? 'Cause I want you to do something I'm telling you to do. Now, stand up. All right, listen. I swear to you, I will stand, and I will leave, 'cause this will get to a place you don't want it to go. You don't wanna see the fuckin' darkness, all right? So, next time, I'm telling you now, you're gonna fuckin' ask nicely. This is the fucking nicest I'm gonna be. I'll take your fucking head right off, do you understand me? Do you understand me? You're gonna have to fucking kill me. You leave a mark on me and I'll have ya. The fuck you doing? You had your chance, now I'm gonna fucking take mine. Better not have AIDS, you cunt. Frank! Fuck sake. Bin these. Brooks! SO! - He went for me! - Who? - The big fella! - Who is it? Wilson! Be on your toes, he's sharp! Don't fucking move, Mackelson! I ain't going nowhere. Am I, sweetheart? Do you have a weapon on you? No, just his tool! Step off! Get on the ground! Wish you could see this. - Jeff, on me, now. - Use your good eye. What is it with this kid? He just reminds me of me. Kid from the estates. You know, becoming a product of your environment, it is hard and it becomes your reality. And it either fires you up, or it makes you lash out, down to the lack of opportunity. And I see that. I see that in him. Opportunity. No one ever gave me a look out. That's why I took this path and I ended up here, the same as you. Maybe it's his path to take. Maybe. If you could change yours now, would ya? Takes time, right? Comes with age, Steve. Kid's a pup. He ain't listening to you. Now it's on you. Little fuckers wanna take their shot. Give it the big 'un when they get out. It's a badge of honour, to wear. Taking a pop at Steve Mackelson? Instant status on the out. You don't wanna be the weak one, not in the way you go out, I get that, but... just saying, it's a risk right now and for what, hm? For what? Kid's opportunity? I don't even think it's about him. I mean, I've got 30 odd years on the boy. I've got a daughter his age. I mean, that makes little sense. I'm a violent man. I got ire in the blood. Part of me thinks I'm just a fucking no-good toe-rag who loves cracking cunts in the jaw. But I don't give a fuck about the tear up. I got no red zone. I'm here... so I might as well be in contention. The difference with me is I could go further. I don't feel nothing. I don't feel shit. I can stab ya, cut ya, slash ya, and hack ya, and I don't feel a thing. Nothing. I've tried to feel something, anything. But I would take a life like you jump the queue. Maybe that's my penance. You know, maybe that's why I'm doing it. Were you born this way? Must've been. Did you kill at my age? No, no, no, no. I wasn't one of them horrible geezers who set cats on fire. I remember once, at school, back in the fields, some kids, they found a rabbit caught in a fence. It was already dead but it had been there a while. And we all just stared at it. And that was the first time that I'd seen anything lifeless. And after a while, a couple of the boys, they, um, started poking it with sticks. Sorta kicking it, you know? Timidly at first. But then after a while, it got harder and heavier. And harder. And I'm standing there and I'm watching these cunts fucking kick and stamp on this dead rabbit's head. And I heard that skull crack. And the skin split from the bone. Claret everywhere. And they're all laughing and egging each other on. Living in it, loving the carnage. Then they kicked that rabbit until its head come off. And that was the first time... The first time that I felt true rage. You gonna die in here? I don't know. Probably. Do you care? What, about her? No. No, I fucking hate her. She betrayed me, she betrayed you. And that cunt with her. He fucking got it as well. He got it. I showed you, bruv, didn't I? I showed ya. Do you wanna meet her? Fuck, no, it's hard. No, I don't know. I mean, you imagine... You imagine a girl grows up with no mom, nor a man, and the little girl gets butchered. Fucking butchered. Fucking stabbed, you cunt. Fucking hacked and fucking stabbed and fucking hacked, you... Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck! Fuck you! Fuck you. I can't do this anymore, man. In here, I'm fucked. Out there, I'm fucked. Screws don't even let me on my four hour in seg. I can't do this for another four, man. And I fight back, it's not like I'm weak, but the more I do, the more my family's getting pressured on the estate. If I turn up against it in here, then I'm just gonna get extended and that ain't a option, man. The only way I can get it done is if I keep on selling their gear. At least then I'll still have some value. The system wins, then I just start kind of... I'm just tired of it, man. 'Cause I can't have you steppin' up for me all the time 'cause eventually you're gonna get tired of it and then what, where to then? I've gotta get out, right? Either through a cracked neck or through the courts. I ain't ever killed no one, I ain't ever opened anybody up. I don't know what to do or how that's done. Sound like a fuckin' cry-baby, man, but those are my options, right? Either stab them up or take what's comin'. Fuckin' screws don't give a fuck. Another blood of their streets. Place is full of us. Why they comin' after me? Why they comin' after me, man? I gotta start stabbing 'em up and take the extra years? Fuck, what choice is that? What fuckin' choice is that, man? You are not allowed to crack. Smarten up. Then I hope you can forget the suffering you've endured. The suffering they've caused you. But... If you are guilty and you know... and this earthly justice hasn't got you yet, then I hope you own that guilt for your sake. Because your life ends with a final trial. No revisions. No parole. No hope. I gave up on hope a long time ago. Sorry? Oh, no, no. Nothing, sorry, I was just, uh... Nothing. Are you okay, Steve? You know, part of me sees it. Sees the good in it. The healing of it, the... The closure, whatever you wanna call it. And? I don't think I can do this. I mean, I can... I can do most things, but this is, uh... This is... It's bound to be uncomfortable. It's bound to be unfamiliar. Unfamiliarity is a trigger for anxiety. The unknown, right? Why put us both through something as uncomfortable as this? I mean, what is the endgame? It's not like we get something out of it, is it? It's... You know, not like a relationship. A future. It's all just a fucking show-and-tell. It's a run-around, it's a getup. I mean, what does she want out of this? You know what she wants. Do I? Yeah. She either wants a start or she wants it finished. A start to what? A tick on the visitors list? And if she wants it finished, then she should let it lie. Close the door on it. I mean, I'm up for it. I'm fucking banged up. Let her live with the story, and put it to bed. As someone who had no say in how her formative years were presented, that's a tough ask. We're here to protect you. If you say no, we say no. But you do have to take ownership of the fact that you do have a daughter, Steve. Flesh and blood. And she wants to meet you. Her father. What is your fear? We responded around 21:10 on the evening of March 4th. A horrendously gruesome amount of blood pooled on the floors. A viciously malicious attack, void of all human compassion or emotion. Danger to society. We find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree. And so you fucking should have. What're you doing here? Got friends in high places. I said what're you doing here? They wanted me to have a word about you. Sit down. Well, I'm not sure this has fuck-all to do with you. Her grandmother never moved out. So we see your kid a lot. Some logic in there somewhere. Do you want a tea? I see they've given you privileges. Trust me, I've had to earn 'em. After all you've done. You know, that's the good thing about time. It passes. And prison loosens the noose after a few years. You know, it's more forgiving in some ways than out there. As long as you keep your murders to one every few years, they're lenient, right? I was having a look at the poem. - Is it yours? - No. The Argyllshire Highlanders. What's it about? The Glencoe murders. I don't know what that is. Well, look it up. I mean, you with your Irish links, I thought you'd be double polished up on your Celtic roots. So that's how you pass your time, is it? Reading and poetry? Well, it's better than sucking cock and doing the fucking laundry. I'm walking out of here a man. So I might as well be a well-versed one. It's interesting that you think you'll be leaving. You know that's not an option, right? I mean, I hope you know. Lying in your coffin's the only way you get past these walls. You are a ray of sunshine, aren't ya? That's why I think you owe it to the kid. What the fuck do you know about the kid? I know she's got her mother's genes. Oh, she's a cunt an' all, is she? I don't get it, the poem. I don't need you to. You don't need much. Never did. But I am glad to see you putting your mind to something. At least scraping the wall will keep your head right. How long you staying? That's down to you. How's Mom? Gettin' older. So she gave up on the visits then, yeah? Her son's a nasty cunt. She gave up on him a long time ago. She blames herself. It's not her fault. Well, it's fair, I mean, you were a... An unhealthy kid. Lost kid. Angry all the time, angry at time. You've been pissed off since you were 14 years old. She holds onto that. Feels accountable. She can wipe her hands of it. It's not her fault. I'm here on my own merit. Still doesn't keep you from repeating your actions, though, does it? - What is this, a lecture? - Just stating facts. Well, don't. Because in here, I survive. Her accountability ended the moment I got free will. What happened out there, I can't help her with that. But in here? In here, it's a rebirth. You know they want me to kiss arse? But you know what they say. You kiss too much arse, you end up chokin' on shit. Well, I ain't going that way, because I belong to no man and no one. For a reason I can't understand, I picked up a knife and I cut up someone who was... Who had no respect for me. And for another reason I can't understand, I can't stop myself from doing it again and again. The shrinks can't work it out. You can't work it out. I can't work it out. So do yourself a favour. Don't waste your time trying to convince yourself otherwise. Now drink your tea. It's getting cold. - What happened? - For fuck sake. - I'm just asking. - Asking what? It ain't your fault, Dad, and it ain't Mom's fault. And it ain't entirely mine. She fucking started it, she did. It all went into a situation where I had to kill the geezer. I'm not talking about just fucking hurt him, stab him a couple of times and sayin' to him, "We're all good, brother, all sorted." No. I stabbed the living life out of him. I showed him what happens. I showed him who the geezer was. She was just a fucking by-product. If she weren't there, she'd still be alive now. Her timing was shit, that's all. It was her fucking fate and you can't put that on me because that ain't planned. And that was that. And then it was done. I was done. As soon as I knew what it meant... and how it made me feel, I didn't give a fuck anymore. Life weren't important to me. And that is why I'm in here, and the rest of you are out there. I know you've done your bird, but you always knew you were getting out. I know I'm not leaving this place, and I'm good with that, 'cause my legacy will be left here, and I am gonna make it as memorable as possible. Do the right thing and see the kid. Say her name. Go on, say her fucking name. You know it. Do you? When was the last time you said it? When was the last time you looked into her soul and offered any kind of healing for what you did? Don't you dare sit there and have the fucking audacity to pick me apart for not having a relationship with her, 'cause you took that away from the lot of us, you cunt. Snatched away any resemblance of humanity from my side of the family. That child, Steve... Stripped of any connection to the two... fuck heads that brought her into this mess of a life. You're going to hell for what you did, son. That poor kid didn't stand a fucking chance. But you know what? Hm? She's got more courage than the pair of ya. It's the only decent thing she got from the merging of two complete wastes of matter, and that makes me so fucking proud. I want her to meet ya. I don't want her to forgive ya. Because I know that'll be more painful for you than for her to hate you. You're comfortable with hate. It's how you function. And I want her to see what a miserable excuse of a man you truly are and that she's missed out on nothing. And I pray, Steve, for your own sake, I pray, that you have an aching in your being. Something you can't hide from. Something you can't fight against. Because I have a feeling that'll be the only time that you'll have a reason to leave this world with any kind of grace. And you'll deserve every single piece of that discomfort. I just wish it would scar visibly as a daily reminder of who you are. I'm my father's son. You got the bottom bunk? Power position, bruv. Where's your cellmate? He's coming back. Aren't we nervous, cuz? I'm just walking the wing. You know me. Street geezers tell me you're marked. Tell me you're on a payment plan. Bird's rough, init? Makes you jumpy and shit. What you got on you? Look, I don't wanna strap up, man. What? Serious, bro. I'm not tightenin' up. Won't have to, if you tell me what you got. - Ain't got nothing. - Huh? I said I don't have anything. Come on, little man. You're forcing the brothers to shake you down. We knows you got weed. We knows you got peas in from your granny. Your family don't wanna see you with your teeth knocked out. Probably best if you call your Nan again, and tell her you need some more bread brought in. Where's your phone card? He won't be back for a bit. They got him on mop-up. He's knee-deep in suds. And you know what happens to a grass, so you're saying nothing, bruv. Can't help you anyway. He's got his own coming. Grab your phone card, give the old girl a bell. I'll be right next to you, make sure you sound legit and that. Bro, I'm not calling my fam while you're here, man. You'll do exactly what I tell you, cuz. Yeah, boss. Game ain't based on sympathy. Fuck do I have to lose? Yeah, you in it now. Play it or don't. You're in the fuckin' lineup till you strap up and knock somebody out. Lined up. Beat down after beat down. Next bam, next bam! Yeah, pussy. White boy can't protect you. That's what happens when you turn from your own. I ain't turned, bro. I never turn. Want it to stop? Stop it. Tool up, start carving, prove your stones. Until then, grab your card, and go and get me some money, cunt. If not, it's gettin' worse. I'll send some boys over to gangbang her 90-year-old snatch and you can spit out your teeth. I play dark, bruv. Please, man. What you say? Nothin'. You fuckin' beggin'? - Please, man. - "Please, man", what? Fuck you! Fuck. What the fuck? Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. I heard you got extended. Charging me with attempted. You might've been better if you'd have killed the geezer. Well, not like I didn't try. It were close, I guess. Well, he's a cabbage now. You could say you done enough. Now's the hard part. Yeah. They're gonna be waiting on ya, you know that? And I told the governor to transfer you or to keep you segged. He thought this was the wise move. And do you? I think you've got some serious decisions to make. Look, I know I'm a dead man walking. I'm just trying to come to terms with it. And have ya? What? Come to terms with it. I'd rather they kill me than have them push my family around. My dad's stopped payin' 'em. Told him there was no more need. I'm good now. So you've knocked the gear on the head? Security's all over my post. Anything that comes in is just gettin' pulled apart now. - I'm on amber alert. - Well, lie low. Get yourself a job somewhere busy. You're gonna get a bit more respect on the yard now. That comes with a violent act. Use it. Anyone who laces up, puts it on ya, is gonna need their head examined. What you've got to worry about now is Dwayne's little lot. Expect retaliation, 'cause it's gonna happen. Trust me. Your only decision from now on is what type of prisoner you wanna be. Whether you take the lumps and you get out in ten, or you become institutionalised. The system's got ya. It's down to you to see how tight. I never wanted the fucking child. Right. What's this supposed to do? Stir up emotions? Maybe. Well, it doesn't. It just doesn't. But by taking away her mother, you have a certain responsibility, morally. And what would happen if I pulled out on this? Well, it's all arranged, Steve. Doing that now, last minute, it will not be looked upon favourably by the court. You'll drop points. There's no shame in feeling nervous and scared. It's perfectly normal. Human. Yeah, I'm scared. Okay. You should care. You should live in your feelings, of course, experience them. And then let that young woman finally have some sense of her own life. Hello, lad! You all right? Got a hat for ya. What the fuck is this all about? Try the hat on, you'll suit the hat, it will look good on ya. - Get that away from me, man. - What're you doin', lad? I said put the fuckin' hat on. What the fuck are you doing, man? Put the fucking thing on your head. Hurry up! Bash his head in now! Hurry up! - Again! - Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're gonna have to be smarter than that, son. It's not about you, Steve, mate. Yeah, it is. Now take it off. Take it off. Head bleeds like a cunt, right? I wanna give you two choices. You can either have a break, or a cut. This is about him and Dwayne, all right? No, no. This is about me and you. And since you're the one with all the mouth, I take it that he's the hard cunt. Are you the hard cunt? He doesn't fucking speak English, Steve, so... Really? You'll go a long way and that could be in your favour. Now, what arm? - What? - What arm do you want broken? Fuckin' try it, Steve. Go on. I will. Now, what fuckin' arm? Either that or it's an artery. So, pick one. At least let me go and get a fuckin' tool so we're even. - Init? - No, mate. You had your chance. I wouldn't fuckin' dream of jumpin' someone in their cell without a fuckin' tool. - You, Frank? - Cunt's a mug. Cunt's a mug. Now get down on the fucking floor and put your arm out. You're gonna have to fuckin' kill me, lad. You're gonna have to fucking kill me! Do you hear me? - Get off me now, fucking cock! - Put your fucking arm out! Stretch it out! You haven't got the fucking balls, you little pussy cunt! Do it. You want some of this? - Fuck off! - Big man, get up here. Fucking stamp on his arm like you mean it and use your heel. No, please don't! Fucking do it like you mean it! Come on! Do it. Don't. Oh, my God, don't, don't, don't, don't. They come in waves. Sometimes you're in a storm. Every night they hit ya. Then after a while, they slow down. Less frequent. When they hit, they still hit big. Slowly over time, they get smaller and smaller. The water's calm. They mean less and less. Sometimes, you welcome them in to break up your days. I kill in dreams. I kill awake. It makes no difference as they've become the same thing to me now. Her grandmother will be there. A formal request was granted yesterday. So what happens if I say no? Nothing. You don't have to do anything further. Signature in a document. I think you should only subject yourself to this particular situation if you have any remorse, or want any kind of forgiveness. I gotta earn. Okay. I won't bring it here. Well, it's hard not to, init, when you're using the gaff as a storage facility. We get spun, you're back in the dark. We won't. Why don't you liven yourself up? Hire yourself a lookout. Use the shower stalls. - Look, I know what I'm doing. - I don't doubt that. So, let me ask you, who's giving you advice? Someone who benefits. An SO? - Who told you? - Well it's obvious, init? SO. Support Officer. "There to correct of or relating to the punishment of criminals in a way intended to rectify their behaviour." I mean, nowhere. Absolutely nowhere does it say that they're there to help. What? And you are? You think they're on your side? As soon as you miss a payment, get caught, or get robbed, they're gonna make sure you say fuck-all to the higher-ups, then they're gonna get a sniff of it on the yard. Then what? - I'll work it out. - You'll work it out. Listen to yourself. Listen to yourself. You're the geezer who just turned fucking four years into a ten-stretch. Mark my words, I'm telling you now, if you get caught with a bit of fucking puff or spice wrapped round ya, they're gonna keep you in here, behind doors, well into your fucking 30s. Now work that one out. - Oh, what do you want, Steve? - What do I want? Yeah, what do you want? I'll tell you what I fucking want. I'm sitting here and I'm looking at you and you look like the geezer on the verge of another fucking cell breakdown. You think you're being extorted. You're being fucking manipulated, do you understand me? And you're being taken for a mug. A mug by inmates and screws. Well, I can handle it. Yeah, really? Yeah and I ain't no fucking mug. You wanna fucking calm it down, son? Don't start with the fucking mouth, not in here. Fuck off, man! What do you want? Look, I'm sorry, man. I'm really fucking sorry, bruv. A lot of time and effort has gone into this, Steve. It benefits more than just you, you know. And although the deciding factor does indeed lie with yourself, these kinds of opportunities are rare. Any form of future decrees will be presented in a firmer manner. You should try and make this easier, 'cause you have many changes coming up to contend with. We'll be transferring Mr. Wainwright into a different wing on Tuesday. They'll kill him. It's his choice. Not ours. Like I said, many things for you to get used to. Taking your mind off it might help. I expect to see you groomed and ready to go tomorrow AM. We'll make it as delicate as possible. But we need you to play a part here, Steve. It'll be far more comfortable for us all. I mean, what happened about this being my choice? You gave up those rights a long time ago. We let you have certain ones up until a point. And that point is here. I heard you're leaving. Yeah. Everything all right? Yeah, I just... I just feel like I need to hold myself, Steve. - You know what I mean? - And can ya? Yeah. If you say you're there, well, then you're there. Yeah. They're getting me out of the wing. You know? Give me a chance to start afresh. Lace up straight off. They're gonna be coming at you. Yeah. I know. At least I can see it coming this time. Part of the process, right? I've taken my hours and lumps in this place. I'm not scared anymore, man. But at least it keeps it from coming in here. You know, gives you some calm. So when you leaving? They said Tuesday. Yeah but I'm trying to keep it quiet. I don't wanna give anyone the chance to have a one-up on me. Well, you know, you might get lucky. You never know. Get yourself a single, shit when you want, do what you want, and get yourself a lovely, sexy SO, y'know what I'm sayin'? Start fucking, start on gunning, son. Aww, I need it, man. I need it. You tried, man. I know you tried. So what about you? You gonna see your daughter? Surely you can get out if you wanted to. Yeah. There's always a way. One of us has to start the conversation. Am I gonna have to carry this through? You look younger than your pictures. I look like my mom. Yeah. So where's your gran? I decided to do this on me own. They're outside. There if I need. I heard that you don't speak to your mom anymore. It's a shame. 'Cause she's a sweetheart. You look younger than I thought, too. Look like my mom. I thought I'd lose it. I thought if I met you, I wouldn't be able to keep it together. It's funny to see you in the flesh. Makes me realise how human you are in a way. I wanted to see what that looked like. Because I've been told for years that you were just a troubled soul, but... I couldn't get me head around that because I came from you. From your troubled soul. I promised myself that this wouldn't be a meeting of two strangers who sit in silence. I wanted to go straight in, head first, and see what was I made from. So is there anything that you want to ask me? How many times did you think about calling this off? And meeting me. Do you mind if I roll up? 'Cause I thought about it loads. Everyone kept asking me why I'd wanna meet you and my answer changed each time, but I guess the real truth was that I wanted to see your eyes. The ones you can barely lift to look at me. You don't owe me anything, you know. I'm not here for your sake. For your discomfort. - Then why are ya? - 'Cause you're my dad. And neither of us can run from that. That's the simple truth. We are blood. And I've sat with that. I've sat with that knowledge and every time I've felt anger swell inside, I'm acutely aware of where I came from, but you know what the thing is? The thing that I've come to learn. I did come from you, Steve. I came from this animal that fuelled such anger and hatred and violence and what I know is this. I am beautiful. I am a kind, caring, beautiful woman, and if I'm part you, that shows me that somewhere inside this horrifically violent, angry person, is a man who is capable of bringing in good into this world. Look, I'm sorry that you did what you did, and I'm sorry that your path has led you here to this place that feels so real to you. So normal. So home. But I'm also grateful that I was brought into this world, however warped the circumstances. I won't be a victim. 'Cause I can look into my child's eyes and know that I've done okay. I loved your mom. And I doubt if you would've known that. And you were brought into this world within that love. But if you're not here for my apology, then the sad fact from me is that's all I've got to offer you. I'm not a good father. And I'm not a good man. I don't know how to be a good man. But I'm glad. I'm glad you realise your beauty. And your light. And I'll take solace in that. Knowing that I done something right, even without my knowledge. But I won't lie to you, because... I have been nervous about meeting you. And I don't usually get nerves. It's new to me. And trust me, I can make eye contact all day long. I don't know what good that's gonna do. 'Cause you're gonna walk out that door, and you're gonna feel relief, or sadness, or happiness. I don't know. But eventually, all that's gonna do is just lead to more and more questions. And then I don't want you to see into that dark place that I know you'll see. Because all I can do is give you false hope. And I'll be back in my world. And my duty to you will be done.
