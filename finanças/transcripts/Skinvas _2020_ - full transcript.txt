I'm feeling very lucky, that skiing has become my lifestyle. I have been competing in slopestyle and big air for many years now and traveling around the world. And last season, it felt like it was time to go back to what really makes me hyped about free-skiing. You know, like, sharing moments in the mountain with my friends, and discovering new aspects of our sport. It had been a while since I was thinking about switching paths and focusing on filming. So it's time to try something new. ♪ Bring me the lion's share ♪ Would you greet it before the dawn ♪ ♪ With the struggle I have suffered ♪ ♪ It's been set up for much too long ♪ ♪ I've got my hand twisted ♪ It's tuned up with a razorblade ♪ ♪ You're left alone on the side of the road ♪ ♪ Don't go running back in the door ♪ ♪ From out which you came ♪ How you've changed ♪ Those sweet whispers you bring me with your kind words ♪ ♪ I been workin' off a honeyed blush ♪ ♪ Getting off of my, my, my knees ♪ ♪ Things ain't getting clear ♪ It don't matter how deep we're gonna dig ♪ ♪ If we can get what's between your legs ♪ ♪ Ain't no reason to keep ourselves here ♪ ♪ How you've changed ♪ How you've changed ♪ Let your ass press me ♪ Oh, won't you let your mouth flow ♪ ♪ There ain't no music Keep 'em crying ♪ ♪ It's better off now that you know ♪ ♪ How you've changed ♪ Oh, how you've changed I grew up watching a lot of people from Quebec from JP Auclair, to Charles Gagnier JF Houle, Yannick B, Phil Casabon. All these inspiration, and through watching ski movies, I saw the girls were there, but there was something missing, which was urban skiing. So it just made sense to me to naturally gravitate towards that. I like street skiing. It's like kind of like a border of yourself I would say, and when you go over the border, or like, when you get like the trick, after that, the feeling is so good I would say. Stuff together, like you go to the spa, to shower together, everyone is watching you, it's kind of like a nice session. It's a group thing. Teeing in the streets here is definitely a very different experience. When compared to other places I had. Yeah, it's fricking cold. Fuck! - Ah! - Oh, no way. It's bad or it's okay? Looking badass. Oh! Sometimes, you beat yourself up and you're like, "Why the fuck am I here?" But in the end, you look at the whole thing and it's so worth it. A lot of us have learned a lot. It's been a lot of trial and error, but it's been really sick.
