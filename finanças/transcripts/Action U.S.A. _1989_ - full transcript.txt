It's only been a week. You're so bad. [man] Come on down here. [woman laughs and sighs] [woman moans] -Shit! -Hey, Billy Ray. Frankie sends his greetings. Who the hell are these guys? Come on, man! We can cut a deal! We don't make deals with dead men. Deals? What are they talking about? Shut up, bitch. Come on, we can deal! This ain't no game show, punk. [Billy Ray] Come on, damn it! Frankie's tired of making deals, pretty boy. This time, you're going to give him what he wants. [tires screech] Let's go for a ride, shithead. How do you expect to get this bird off the ground with your fat ass onboard? [man] We'll see about that. Come on, let's get this thing airborne. I've looked forward to this since last year. Better get ready. Fuck you, asshole. [man] lt's a pretty little town, ain't it? Why don't you take a closer look. [screams] What's wrong, Billy Ray? Move it up fast, moron! Eat shit! Come on, guys! Let me up! Help! Aah! You ain't going to get away there. Don't drop me, asshole! You got me pissed off, you lucky fucker. Now let's see if you can fly. [indistinct shouting] Oh, my God. [Billy Ray] Come on! I can't take it out here much longer! Look, man, l can't tell you what l don't know. Just give Frankie what he wants, Billy Ray. [Billy Ray] All right, it's in the gym! Locker number 1 2. [screams] [man] Goddamn it, you let him drop! Come on, take us down over there. Down there. On the bridge. We're out of gas. [man] l don't give a shit. We got to get him. What happened to you? Move the fuck over, damn it! [engine revs] [tires screech] That black car. .. set her down. Come on, perez, let's get that Mercedes. Come on, get your ass out of that car, you old fart. Come on, move. Move! You can't take that car. lt's paid for. [tires squeal] Damn! Billy, take it easy. [sighs] Where are we going? Why'd those guys come after you? Don't ask me that. l can't tell you. I want to help you. I don't need any help, goddamn it. Well, at least tell me who they are. Believe me, you don't want to know. Punch it, punch it! He's getting away! -Come on! -Hell, l'm on him, goddamn. They want something, and l know where it is. They think l told them the truth, -but l fooled them and l jumped. -You jumped? Yeah, l jumped into the cold, cruel world, into snow and ice. Beautiful ice. Snow and ice? People are always wanting something from me. And believe me, the less you know about it, the better. Where are we going? Can we hide from 'em? There's an old ranch just outside of Aveline. The Circle D. Do you like windmills? -What, you mean like in Holland? -Yeah. Tulips in the springtime. Tulips? Dikes, chocolate, cheese. Punch the son of a bitch. Hey, you want to fucking drive? [gunshot] Come on, we'll get him now. He's going in some traffic. Hang on! I'll get the son of a bitch this time, l swear to God. If you wouldn't have dropped the son of a bitch, we wouldn't be chasing him anyway. [tires screech] [gunshot] Hey, stop! [tires screech] [car horn honks] [gunshot] [horns honk] [gunshot] [screams] [car horns honking] Hang on a second. I can't! Help! [screams] [woman screams] What do you mean you're giving me a ticket?

[gunshot] [car horn honks] Come on, move that damn thing. l got work to do. [horns honking] [indistinct arguing] I'm gonna bust your ass. I'm gonna pop your jaw. [indistinct chattering] Hey, settle down. Keep it down. [horn honking] Oh, my God, turn at the bus! Hang on, baby. We're going airborne. [indistinct shouting] [all scream] No! Watch out for the motor home! Hang on to your ass. We're going through. Oh, shit! [all cheer] Come on, let's get him. Get in there. Get in. Let's get the girl too. Come on, get her out of there. Come on. What the fuck you looking at? Get the fuck out of here, goddamn it. [horn honks] Come on, out of the car. What are you going to do with us? Ask him. End of the line, babe. -End of the line. -[woman] No. Please, what do you want? We'll give it to you. Too late for that. Enough of this shit. Waste him. -Yeah! -[woman] No! No! Eat lead, fucker. No! No, please! No! Motherfucker! [sobbing and wailing] [gunshots] Shit! Let's get out of here. [shrieks] [sobbing] [panting] Relax! Look, l'm with the FBl . -Prove it. -Hold on, okay? Look, l'm Clay Osborn. I'm here to help you. Well, then get off of me! Don't touch me! I'm sick of people grabbing at me! Bitch! [panting] Very nice. Hmm. [sighs] [woman] Where are we going? What about my rights? Or isn't this a free country anymore? You're not under arrest. Well, great, why don't you let me off at the next corner. We can't do that, Miss. Just because some crazy guys come and kill my boyfriend is no reason for you to arrest me. You are not under arrest. This is all for your own protection. I'm a big girl. l can take care of myself. You don't have any idea what kind of people you've gotten mixed up with, do you? I assume you're talking about the two of you? Look, you saw a murder. The men who did it know it. And we got to get you to a safe place until-- [clears throat] Until what? What the hell is going on here? Where are you taking me? Miss, l'm afraid we cannot tell you any more. [sighs] We will be boarding a flight shortly to take us to an undisclosed location for an indeterminate period. There, you'll have adequate shelter, food and new clothing. Look at me. Can we at least stop so l can get cleaned up? There's no time. [scoffs] Shit. I'm Carmen. Agent Earl McKinnon. Call me Panama. Panama? Far out... for an FBl agent. If you are with the FBl . [sighs] Hey! We missed the last flight, didn't we? By 10 minutes. [sighs] Another night in glorious Texas. -Where's Carmen? -She's in the car. And we had better get that woman something to eat in a hurry. Yeah, well, l'll book us a room. [crowbar clatters] The girl. Are you sure Billy Ray didn't say anything about diamonds? About a shipment for a man named Frankie Navarro? Or a package? I've told you and l've told you! He didn't say anything about diamonds! I don't know anything about Frankie. Look, it's important. There's nothing l can do about it! Clayton, give it a rest. Look, she's been through a lot. Yeah, what about us the last four months, huh? Five goddamn states, now we lose our only lead to the Navarro syndicate. -Right, but she didn't kill him. -l know that. We got to get some answers quick, or Conover's going to nail our asses to the wall. Did he say anything that sounded unusual? Anything you didn't understand? Unusual? You didn't know him. He was weird! He was crazy! Like he was making his life up as he went along. [sobs] You guys think l can get a room to myself? Come on, a little privacy can go a long way right now. It's not possible, Miss. I knew you'd say that. Great work, Osborn. Nice interrogation. [pritchard] Things are generally quiet around here, except for parking tickets and bar fights. Ha! Yes, sir, you can say that again. Once we get the witness to Dallas, we'll be back for perez and Garrick. Where'd y'all end up staying last night, if you don't mind my asking? Yeah, well, thanks for all your help, sheriff. [sighs] This here's pritchard. Let me speak to Frankie. [Frankie] lt's about time you done something right, you asshole. Don't get suds on that. Where are you? Huh? Town Motor Lodge. They'd better be there, for your sake, asshole. Oh, you got suds on my cigar. Aah! Aah! [all laugh] [shower running] You okay? [sighs] Don't you ever let me get talked into Siamese food in Texas again. She put it away pretty good. Did you see the look on that busboy's face? He was definitely on the edge. [sighs] Be a pillar of your community. Fight crime. Serve and protect your fellow citizens. [both] Defend the Constitution of the United States. Exactly. And where does it get you? Another 20 years of chasing 10-cent hoods. Sleeping every night on a different cheap mattress. And then wham, bam, thank you, ma'am. Hey, we sure do appreciate your risking your life every night since 1 075. Here's your half-price pension. If they don't lay you off before you're vested. [sighs] Or get your ass killed. Ship you to a desk in Oklahoma. Yeah, there's got to be a room somewhere in Washington full of guys just laughing their heads off. So... you going to stick it out for your 20? -I got a choice? -Oh, come on, Clay. Everybody's got a choice. Except her, maybe. I kind of feel sorry for her. Clay Osborn, Eagle Scout? Ah, she seems like a nice kid. [shower turns off] [knock on door] -[Carmen] All right. -Whoa, excuse me. You're excused. You want to get a move on, Miss? We've really got to get going. Get away from that window, Miss! Why? What are you worried about? [gasps and screams] [screams] [shrieking] He's dead. You okay, Miss? [Carmen screams] Let's go! Go! [gunshots] [tires screech] Goddamn perez. Good thing he's dead. I'd have killed him anyway. Oh, shit! -Shit! -Jump it! Jump it! Hang on! Hang on! [all scream] Ha! Yeah! All right! Oh, shit! [screaming] [gunshots] [rock music playing] A bunch of fucking amateurs. I could give a shit about Garrick. I've had it with the alibis and the excuses. Now you listen, Drago's coming in at the airport. You go pick him up. Tell him l want the broad back here alive. Why'd Frankie send for a heavyweight like Drago? We could have taken care of this. Yeah, so why don't you complain to Frankie? I'm not crazy. Boss called in Drago, he must want 'em bad. Is that him? [Hitch] Which one? No, no. What about the guy in the long coat? [Lucky] That's him. Mr. Drago, l'm Lucky. This here's Hitch. That's quite an outfit. You heard of Rome? What about it? I'm in Texas. And when in Texas, l dress like a Texan. Yes, sir. Let's go. -I'll drive. -Oh, you got to be careful, because this thing is really hot. So am l . What do you mean it's booked? I have reservations. I realize that, sir, and l'm so sorry. Look, l'm with the FBl . Now, l need three seats on this morning's flight. [typing] I'm sorry, that's impossible, sir. Look, l got to be on that plane, so you just do what you got to do -to get me my seats. -But 21 7 just left. When's the next flight? [typing] 9:30 Monday morning. Damn! You got a telephone? Uh-huh. Right that way, sir. [typing] Anything else, Mr. Conover? How about dinner? Joe's pizza, around the corner. -Double cheese, anchovies. -We'll see. Excuse me. Sir, it's Osborn on the safe line. His flight's been overbooked. He can't catch a plane. I don't want him on a damn plane. -What do they got? -Billy Ray's dead. He has a witness that he wants protected. -What'd he give up? -l don't know. He just said that his flight was overbooked and he couldn't get a plane. You tell him you'll be down at the border with some agents. Get to it. Move. Yes, sir. Look, you just, uh, hang tight, okay? I'll be right back. Yeah. Conover says there's a leak in Washington. He's afraid if we send a pilot he'd never make it back. You mean they can't even scare up a four-seater to get us out? Firestone and Rucker will meet us haltway at the Jessup Corners Bridge. They'll take the girl up to Oklahoma City from there. Wait a minute. Don't tell me. -No backup. -What else? You got to love the FBl . Always there when you need them. So, how far is it to Jessup Corners? -You want the scenic route? -Naturally. [both] Let's eat. Oh, boy, this looks good. Is that your nickname? "Panama"? How come they call you that? I've been trying to get that out of him for two years. I think he just hates his real name, don't you, Earl? How long are you going to keep this up? Only till you tell me. You guys got to learn to relax. Last night you wanted us dead. Maybe l'm getting to like you. Anyway, l can't stay mad forever. Especially at lunch. Any guess. Lucky, give me a light. So how much time is it going to take to finish the job? There's one thing we know, Lucky, it's how to do time. [laughs] Leavenworth. Sing Sing. [spits] Yuma. Joliet. Norfolk. Bragg. Huntsville. Merle Haggard. Goddamn Johnny Cash. [both laugh] What the hell are you guys talking about? Education, son. Life and death. Reality. Prison to you, Lucky. I can't wait till l'm as experienced as you guys. [all laugh] You know, Frankie's not going to let this thing rest. There's a hell of a lot of country outside. All we need to do is get to the bridge. Tabasco, please. You think he'll send Drago? [Carmen] Salt. -Wouldn't you? -[Carmen] Thank you. Do you want your pickle? -No. -Thanks. You know, sometimes you find the best places out on the road. Are you not hungry? Too bad. Looks like they're about ready to leave. About the only goddamn home l ever had was gray walls. Everybody's a prisoner on this mud ball. Only them poor, dumb bastards don't know it. [all laugh] Hey, the quail's moving. Let's hunt. Let's go. Get the door for you, ma'am? Thank you. [Drago] Move, goddamn it! Get in the back! Come on, move it! Hurry up! Goddamn it, let's go! Go, go! -Shit! -l'll get the car. I'm going to call Frankie. Keep an eye on her. Back it over to the corner there. Now don't you worry, honey. I'm not going to hurt you. I love a real man. Bet you could really teach a girl to behave. I've been a bad girl. Maybe you could show me sometime. Don't play me, sweetheart. Don't do that. You know, it's really the strong silent types that get me going. You got a name, honey? Don't play me, sweetheart. Get a hold of Frankie? No. Lucky, you stop messing around with these skirts. Get your ass in the back seat. We got a job to finish. What exactly do you do? Me? I bury people, bitch. Freeze! Shit. -Don't move! -You wouldn't shoot with this little girl in the car, now would you? It's Drago. Hey! Get the fuck out of here! Get out! Stay down. Lucky, get that goddamn car started. They took the damn keys! You want me to hot-wire it, Drago? No, we'll push the son of a bitch. Of course, hot-wire the motherfucker! Where in the hell did you find him? He's doing the best he can, Mr. Drago. Hey, kid. Next time you leave the car, make sure you take the keys. Somebody could steal the son of a bitch. Where are we? Next three towns are... pushton, Dukdole and Babbittville. That's what l love about Texas. It doesn't matter what little town you're in, they all look just alike. You know, l really want to travel. But not like this. A real trip. New Orleans. New York. Or maybe Europe. I'd like to go to California, but l've never seen a lot of snow. It's funny, Billy Ray was talking about snow. Snow and ice. You never told us that before. I just remembered it. Does it make a difference? Hey, anything could make a difference. You look like a married man, Panama. I was once. Yeah, me too. Take my advice. Never marry a cowboy. [McKinnon] l hadn't planned on it. Hey, Osborn, you in there? You think too much. You too, Panama. You know, you guys got to learn to just slow down and relax. Wait a minute. l know that place. Billy Ray said something about Circle D Ranch. Snow and ice. He had to mean the diamonds. What else did he say? Think. Think! I am. Don't push me. You know, there's only about a million and a half places you could hide something around here. Look, are they in any kind of container? Did he meet anyone here? Was he just passing through, or did he actually make the drop here? Think, damn it! Look, he didn't say anything! I can't tell you what l don't know. Real smooth, Osborn. Fuck off. Look, uh... l'm sorry. It's okay. No, really, uh, l shouldn't have gotten mad. Forget it. None of this has been easy. Damn. You married, Osborn? [laughs] No. Why not? Things have a tendency not to work out. Let me guess. There's always something wrong with the woman. She's not pretty enough. [scoffs] She's not smart enough. She's lousy in the sack. She hates ltalian food. Yeah, well, l hate to burst your bubble, but l'm not the one who does the leaving. By the time l get back home, there's nobody there. Well, we've all got our problems. The only problem l have is keeping you alive. You keep me alive, and maybe in return l'll keep you alive. [sighs] Clay, l think this is really a waste of time. I'm sorry. l wish l could help. No, it's okay. lt's not your fault. Unless, uh... Unless l can remember something else. [sighs] Well... he did mention Holland. Great. A travelogue. No. Go on. That's all. He talked about tulips. And? Chocolate. Dikes. And Hans Brinker and the Silver Skates. Something about cheese. [McKinnon] And windmills. Yeah. He did mention windmills. You take the high road. I planned on it. Earl. [Carmen] Wow! [gasps] Look at these rocks! Now there's a handful of trouble. -[laughs] -Amen. You know, there's no official record of these. -[laughs] -Don't even think about it. [Carmen] Whoo! [Drago] You know what l hate the most? What's that? The smell of dry piss, alcohol, and death. I'll tell you, l think l'd rather be dead than locked up in one of those joints. How much it cost to keep him in a place like that? Every damn cent l can lay my hands on. Depends on the medical bills. Hey, at least we still got our moms with us, you know? I'm an orphan. Nothing lucky about that. That's right. Without our moms, where the hell would we be today? Nowhere. Wiping other people's asses, digging ditches. Not me. My mother deserves the best, and l don't give a goddamn who l have to kill. She's going to live out her life in style. Shit. There they go. Clay, wake up. Clay, we got company. Who is it? Shit. Get down! I'll tell you, with this gun l believe l can take them out with one shot. You call that a gun? That's a pimple. This is a gun. [both laugh] -Let's kick some educated ass. -Let's go. You lose them. -I'm not Mario Andretti, okay? -Let's pretend. -Watch the wheel. -l got it, go ahead. [gunshot] Shit. [gunshot] Damn, he got the rubber, he got the rubber. Lucky, get out there.

[gasps] Come on! [engine starting] Hitch, get in the car! Lucky, move! [gunshots] Get out of the way, you goddamn hick. Lucky, come on. Get your ass in here. Come on, let's go. [tires squeal] [inaudible] [car horn honks] Goddamn it, drove right through the bedroom! Sorry about the house, buddy. [tires screech] [car horn honks] [Drago] Hey, J. Edgar Hoover, how do you want to be buried? Ass up, or head down? Oh, shit! [Hitch] Come on, Drago, now let's get this over with before you get us all killed. All right, get me on his goddamn tailpipe. [Hitch] Oh, yes, sir. You're going to have to take the wheel. [screams] [gunshot] [gasps] Oh, good Lord! [panting] [screams] Clay, get in the truck! Come on! Clay! Come on! [car horn honking] Come on! Hurry! Big truck! What the hell's going on? Aah! I'll see you in hell, Lucky! [Osborn] Hang in there, buddy. Conover's sending down a couple men. [scoffs] You got to love the FBl . Always there when you need them. You know, uh, you never told me where "Panama" came from. My mom and dad. Never got any further from Newark. Coney lsland. Stay with me. Yeah. They started calling me "Panama" because that was about the farthest place from Newark they could think of. And that's what they wanted for me. To get as far away as l could get. The name just kind of stuck. [nurse] The sedative is taking effect. He needs to sleep now. I'll be at the Charles Hotel. Call me if his condition changes. Maybe Panama was right. What's the point? He's got people who care about him, does the right thing... [Carmen] He'll make it. Tomorrow morning l'll take you to our agents at the bridge. Our people should be moving on Frankie about then, so, uh... you won't have a thing to worry about. Then you'll leave me. I almost got you killed five times over. But you didn't. I'm still here, and l'm not ready to say goodbye. Are you ready to say goodbye? I'm not sure l even want to say good night. Then don't. I have to. [alarm clock beeps] [silences beep] [sighs] [gasps] Morning. I thought you were dead. They don't build a bullet big enough. Let's go. What do you mean he's not there? He was just there last night. McKinnon. Right. Right, that's him. How's he doing? Clay! Help! -Where are we going? -Shut up. Lucky. [Lucky] Come on, let's go. [grunts] Goddamn you. You do that again and l'll empty your skull. Now, stay there. -Drago! -[Carmen] Clay! Is this what you're looking for, you wimpy piece of shit? Let her go! Sure. Whatever you say. [gunshots] -[Lucky] lt's locked. -Ow! [gunshot] -[screams] -[Drago] Come on. [Drago muttering] Clay! Get goddamn across the street, Lucky. Goddamn! Watch it, Lucky! Move it, move it! [screaming] Shut up. Let's go, come on. -[screaming] -Get over there by the stairs. Come on. Over by the stairs. Hurry up. Get over there. Move your ass. Up here. [clicking empty] Goddamn it. [gunshot] [Carmen] Help! [Drago, panting] Hurry up. -[Carmen screams] -[Drago] Ah, shut up. Goddamn this. Come on. Hurry up, Lucky. Surprise. Take it easy. Somebody wants to see you. Tickle him, Lucky. That's why they call me Lucky. All right, now send him to heaven. No! -[gun clicks empty] -Oh, fuck. You're not so lucky now, asshole. [screams] [panting] Let's get it over with. Oh, l'm going to teach you the Sing Sing slice, son. This is for old Hitch. Come on, you're not so goddamn good. Come on, get up. Get up... [grunts] Damn, baby, you are better than l thought. Look at that vertical blow! [laughs] -Clay! -[Drago] Come on, son. Come on. There's another one! [laughs] Oh, damn, the FBl sure doesn't make them tough anymore. Come on. Look me in the eye. Come on, that's it. Come on. Get up. Look at me. Oh, yeah. You fiabby piece of shit. Take that! Ooh, you son of a bitch. Oh! Goddamn you, bitch! That had nails in it! You little twat, son of a bitch. Clay, are you all right? You okay? I'm okay. l'm okay. You hungry? No. I don't mind stopping. We have time. I wouldn't want to put you out. Come on, Carmen. What do you want from me? I'm just trying to do my job, protecting a federal witness from being chased by a bunch of assholes who shoot at us every time l turn around. Just doing your job. [sighs] Why don't you tell that to Panama... if he's still alive. Give me the binoculars. Listen to me. I want you to stay in the car, and don't move till l come back for you. -But what if--? -Don't move. Where's the girl? She's safe. -That's good. -Drago got away. I expected to see Firestone and Rucker. Well, l really couldn't risk it. You see, we're not really sure who we're dealing with. Could l see the diamonds, please? How do you. . .? Well, we came up empty. Really? You don't want to smoke. He don't want to smoke, does he? You don't. You know, you'll never pull this off. If you even slip past the Bureau, Frankie will find you. Well, l never really considered Frankie any sort of a threat. Drago knew where we were. And where we were going all along, didn't he? See, Billy Ray was the only one that really knew where the diamonds were. Now, you have them... and l want them. Think about what you're doing. It's not worth it. I've been thinking about it for 25 years. Five more years, l'm a retired FBl agent. A future security guard. So, what l do, l get up in the morning, l go out to the golf course, and l play nine holes, wham. Then l come home and l sit on a porch with my fat ass-- A lot of men have risked their lives for you. What about them? Fuck 'em. If they were smart, they would have taken their chance when they got it. I wanted to bring you into this thing, Osborn. You're smart and you're tough. But you think small. The diamonds. The diamonds. Not a chance. Maybe. Come here. You heard him. Take a look. The car is hooked up with 1 0 pounds of TNT wired to this frequency. You bastard. The diamonds. The diamonds. Now, let's find the girl. [screams] [screaming] [grunts] Fucking yuppie. Oh, my God. I got you, fucking bitch! [screams] No! Damn it! Is he in there? [panting] [McKinnon] Get your butt over here... so l can kick it. [Carmen] Panama. Are you okay? You had me a little worried there, buddy. Had you worried? Getting out of the car wasn't the tough part. It was all that rolling. [gasps and groans] Conover? He didn't make it. The diamonds? They went in the river with Drago. Well, so much for Panama. Oh, at least you're alive. -Yeah. -Well... it ain't a total loss. Huh? Guess that bag had a hole in it. -Oh! -[Osborn laughs] Oh, the hell with it. [laughs] You take care of Panama. l'll go get the truck. Don't even say it. [McKinnon] You know those diamonds are government property. [Osborn] Yeah. Right, right. Right. Right. [both laugh] [both] Not anymore. [McKinnon] Panama sounds pretty good to me. Palm trees, ocean breeze... -[Osborn] Uh-uh, uh-uh! -. . .native girls. [Osborn] Look, do you have any idea what's going on down there right now? I don't know about you, but l am tired of getting shot at. [McKinnon] Okay. lt was just a suggestion. What do you got in mind? [Osborn] St. Thomas. [McKinnon] Ooh. Hey, l like it, l like it. [Osborn] Of course, we're never going to get anywhere with her driving. [McKinnon] She just might surprise you. [Carmen] Hang on. [Osborn & McKinnon] Right. -[man 1 ] Slate. -[man 2] Marker. Wired with 1 0 tons of TNT and it's only...
