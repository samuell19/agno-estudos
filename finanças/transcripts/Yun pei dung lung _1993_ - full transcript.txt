I'm so angry! Why are you so angry? This bitch really got me mad. She's so bad! She thinks that she's good enough and can fly away. If it's not me who brought her here. She wouldn't have had today. Think it over with your piggy head. If I'm not somebody, you won't have a chance to appear on stage. But she really sings well! Brother hung! Don't be angry, have a tea to calm down.
