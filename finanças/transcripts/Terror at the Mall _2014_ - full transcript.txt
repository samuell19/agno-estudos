In September 2013, al-Shabaab, an al-Qaeda-linked terrorist group from Somalia, attacked a shopping mall in neighboring Kenya. More than 100 security cameras recorded the attack, which left 71 people dead. Some footage was destroyed by fire... but much of it survives and it documents the attack in stark detail.

It was the best mall in Nairobi. It was very up-market. It's the place where prominent people come. ♪ ♪ At the back of the mall was Nakumatt, a giant supermarket on two floors. Nakumatt at Westgate was the premier supermarket in Nairobi. It had an escalator. That was a huge thing for Kenya, you know, to have an escalator inside a supermarket.

I was quite excited to do my shop, because I was doing a big shop and I don't go to Nakumatt very often. I try to do all my shopping at the local supermarket, but I was finding stuff you don't normally find, you know. I'm French and I remember finding Orangina, which is a drink you get in France and I remember thinking-- getting really excited about it. We were planning on getting as many groceries as we could. We needed to do it relatively quickly, because I had a little baby who was eight months old, and he was heading close to naptime.

At 12:30 Andrew Munyua was at the street entrance to the mall. I thought of just passing through Westgate, do a few errands, buy some packed lunch and then later on pick my boy and come back home, like normal. You have to go through security check and I was at the door, when I was being searched and my hands was raised up. I was just walking in front of Nakumatt when there was a loud explosion. Bang! I realized the guard that was searching me had now fallen down. The grenade went off, immediately followed by gunfire. You could see people falling on the floor. Some were diving for cover, but some were actually falling. When I dived down, I decided to touch my chest. I checked down and I saw there was blood on my fingers. Niall Saville and his wife Moon Hee had been having lunch on the terrace at Urban Burger. I realized that my wife wasn't actually behind me. I saw her crawling on the ground, clearly in a lot of pain. Her legs looked very bloodied.

They're killing women and children "and they're making baby faces at us and waving." So I turned around and started walking out. As I got there, this tear gas dropped right at the entrance. I had to decide: do I walk out into the mall area from the supermarket "or do I turn around and go back into the supermarket?" I was like, "I'm not going back to where those guys are. I'm not going back to where they just killed everybody." ♪ ♪ There were hordes of people. There were security forces outside. I mean it felt like millions of people had surrounded the mall. And I didn't stop. I just kept on running. ♪ ♪ The tear gas had actually affected my eyes, so I started walking towards the main entrance. On the right side there was the Urban Burger café, so I thought I might as well get some water and splash it in my face. By now Niall had been bleeding for more than 3 hours. I'd lay there, kind of drifting in and out of consciousness and at some point I was aware of movement coming into the burger restaurant. Someone had come over... and was basically washing their-- their face and eyes in the sink that was more or less above our heads. I asked him where he'd been injured and he pointed to his shoulder and his leg. So I told him... "Just bear with me. I'm going to get some help for you, and we'll get you out of here." You try and do what you can not to be helpless, but when that kind of situation happens, there's a limited set of options. The biggest thing is not knowing what's happening, and so you're having to make choices without any real idea of what the consequences of those choices could be. It feels wrong in some ways calling it "unlucky," because someone set out to do this. But for us to be there... was just a matter of bad luck. ♪ ♪ Pablo Ghataurhae had gone to watch the cooking competition with his family. When the attack began, he was on the rooftop with his grandmother. Pablo was 17 years old. He was going to go into university to do mechanical engineering. ♪ ♪ He wanted to be a rally driver. It's funny, he used to make these statements to me at times, "When I become a rally driver..." be prepared, Mom. I'm gonna die early... "so you be prepared." He went with his grandma, which I'm proud of. He looked after her while she was alive, and he's looking after her all the way up there. ♪ ♪ The terrorists returned to the meat counter, looking for anyone hiding or playing dead. There is a lady who was behind me. She-- she was alive. The gunmen had been speaking to their masters in Somalia and needed more minutes for their cell phones. They're saying, "Where do we find the Safaricom scratch cards?" So the lady said, "The scratch cards-- it is at the tills, but I don't know the password." - After that they ask her, - "Are you a Kenyan?" The lady say yeah, she's a Kenyan. They ask her if she's a Christian or a Muslim. The lady told them, "I'm a Christian." One of them just fired. One gunshot and the lady was dead. Cashier Veronicah Kamau was killed at nine minutes to 4:00, three hours and 21 minutes into the attack. She was the last civilian to die at Westgate. ♪ ♪ The terrorists left the shop floor and headed up a service staircase towards the furniture storeroom. Of perhaps 2,000 people at the mall that Saturday, they had killed 61, including a dozen children and three pregnant women. Hundreds more were left with permanent injuries. Three and a half hours after the terrorists had struck, the police SWAT team finally entered the mall, but it was too late to save anyone. The massacre was over. ♪ ♪ As they worked their way down from the second floor... on the ground floor a platoon of Kenyan soldiers were entering Nakumatt, looking for the terrorists. ♪ ♪ They advanced through the vegetable section towards the meat counter, where six shop workers were still hiding. ♪ ♪ We can see them, on that reflection. I told-- I told my friend, "Hey, is that police? Are they police?" I opened the door. They felt I was a terrorist, so they sprayed the bullets towards that side. The soldiers now fired at anything that moved. I tried to signal at them, as I waved the uniform. "We are the Nakumatt staff! Nakumatt staff!" Because I felt it was unsafe just to come out physically, that one-- they would have shot me. Man, those soldiers-- they do not consider. They are just shooting, yeah? They're just shooting. As the soldiers fired wildly around them, the four terrorists were relaxing in the furniture storeroom. By mistake, the army shot three policemen, one of them fatally. We put him onto the stretcher and we were rushing him out, then all of a sudden he started shaking. He clearly said, "We can't work like this. We are the ones who are supposed to be the head of this." They withdrew completely from the operation. In the confusion, both the Kenyan army and the police SWAT team left the mall, just 90 minutes after they'd arrived. ♪ ♪ In the furniture storeroom, the al-Shabaab gunmen prayed. They had come to kill and be killed. Now they waited for the Kenyans to attack. Very little is known about them. The youngest was 19, the oldest 23. All four had arrived in Kenya three months earlier. They had scouted Westgate a number of times before the attack. After a few hours in the storeroom, the terrorists noticed the security camera and disconnected it. Later that night, a squad of Kenyan soldiers crept back into Nakumatt. With them was a civilian who videoed the meat counter where Amber and her children had hidden earlier in the day. ♪ ♪ Fred Bosire, in his white coat, had been playing dead for 8 hours. I still lied down. When I saw the military boots and the uniform, now I was relieved. The shop workers who'd been hiding behind the meat locker were also freed. They were the last group of civilians to be rescued from the mall. ♪ ♪ I was very lucky. I can say I was very lucky. Maybe that was my day. That's what I can say. At 13 minutes past 9:00, a security camera captured the last recorded image of the terrorists. ♪ ♪ The stand-off between the terrorists and the Kenyan army continued for another 40 hours, during which five soldiers were killed. Two days after the attack began, the army fired a high explosive shell into Nakumatt. All four terrorists died in the fire. Their weapons and what remained of their bodies were later recovered from the ashes. As Nakumatt burned to the ground, the security cameras stopped recording. The mall, which was under army control, was looted. The Kenyan government stood by the actions of its security forces. I am satisfied that our disciplined forces have responded in a professional and effective manner. We have ashamed and defeated our attackers. Let us continue to wage a relentless moral war as our forces conduct the physical battle. We shall... triumph. Hundreds of miles north in Somalia, al-Shabaab also declared a victory. Leave alone Islam. Islam-- the term "Islam," it means "peace." Where is peace? Where is Islam now? The term Islam-- where is it when you kill innocent children? When you kill women? I'm a Muslim myself. For now, Westgate remains closed. It isn't known when it might open again. Whatever the intended meaning of al-Shabaab's spectacle at Westgate, the security cameras revealed it as little more than the mass murder of defenseless civilians. ♪ ♪ I don't really blame them as individuals. They really were just ordinary men with very very wrong ideas about life. When I spoke to them, there was a real calm and determination about what they were doing. They were there to send out a message to the world-- however messed up that message was-- and to die doing it. As long as I've got breath left inside me... and a finger... to squeeze the trigger... I won't let... the same thing which happened at Westgate... happen again.
