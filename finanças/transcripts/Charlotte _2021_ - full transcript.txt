I've called it, "Life, or theatre?" How did you manage to paint so many? Time's running out. I had to finish quickly. Please keep it safe. It's my whole life. Mama? I will miss this. They have the opera in Rome. No. I will miss this. Jews, out! Come on! What you looking at?! Come on, out! We'll stand for no interruptions from you. You charge in here like common brutes. Find a place, and sit quietly or leave. But we will resume our program. Let's go. I think this is the end. Let us begin. Again. Maybe Gross mama and Grosspapa are right to leave. Germany is our homeland. We aren't leaving. What would you say you're doing? Your grandmother needs to rest her nerves. We could all rest our nerves. I won't stand for cheek! No more. Please. - Charlotte. Not now. All right. Not now. That's very good. Oh... Thank you. There's so much to see, it's hard to know where to look. It must be wonderful to be able to draw. When you leave, you can take a part of this with you. Yes. Hello, I'm Ottilie. Ottilie Moore. Ah. I am Herr Doktor Ludwig Grunwald. This is my wife, Frau Marianne Benda Grunwald. And this is my... - I'm Charlotte. Charlotte Salomon. - Are you visiting? - We've recently moved here. From Berlin. Our granddaughter is just visiting. I'm also visiting. I'm from New York. - Oh. It was lovely to meet you. Are you studying art in Berlin? With tutors. I dropped out of school. I like you more and more. I think you're the only one. A smart girl like you, I don't suppose you dropped out because you couldn't figure out the square of the hypotenuse. They must have been horrible to you. It's just how it is for Jewish girls in Germany. Well, fortunately the world is bigger than Germany. Your granddaughter is a very charming young woman. Yes. She's always enjoyed travelling with us, ever since she was a girl. Forgive me if this sounds presumptuous, but I now live in the CÃ´te d'Azur, and my place is very beautiful. I have plenty of room for guests. That's very kind, Mrs. Moore. I'm afraid Charlotte's place is in Berlin with her parents. They have their careers there. Of course. But if Italy doesn't work out, or if Berlin becomes impossible, my door is always open. Signorina! Signorina! Allow me. We've got a lot of work to do, Frau Lindberg, to recapture your former perfection. Whether I attain perfection or not, who is going to notice, Mr. Wolfsohn? If you truly attain it, it won't matter who notices. Singing is the urge to freedom. And you will be liberated from... There you are. Where have you been? I went for a walk in the park. By yourself? I think that's still permitted. Charlotte, meet Mr. Alfred Wolfsohn. Mr. Wolfsohn was sent to me by Dr. Singer. He has also suffered under the current conditions. With the proper tutelage, your mother has the technique and voice to become the greatest singer in the world. Then how lucky for the world that she's found such a teacher. Are you an artist? - I... - Charlotte is at the Schmoller School of Fashion Design. She's good with her hands, like her father. We're hoping she'll find work as a seamstress. And is this also your hope? Drawing is more of a hobby for Charlotte. I'd love to see your work sometime. I'd like that too. Very nice to meet you. How can you draw? I'm so nervous, I can barely sit still. I suppose it's what I do to settle my nerves. Who is that supposed to be? I don't know yet. Charlotte Salomon. Heil Hitler. Yes, yes. Heil. Put them on the desk. Thank you. Miss Salomon, I'm sure you appreciate how competitive our school is. There are far more applicants than placements, and artists without formal training are at a distinct disadvantage. You are currently at a school of fashion design. And then, there is the unfortunate matter of your race. However, the committee did look favourably at your sketch. And took into consideration your father's Iron Cross. Miss Salomon, I need to know if despite the circumstances, I offer you a place, will I come to regret it? No, I promise you won't. Thank you! Barbara Frisch Prinz. You will see here how the light strikes the subject. Now it is important that the shadow and shade that you use follows... Lotte. We've been expecting you. Your classes would've ended long ago. I hope you weren't wandering around on your own again. No, I guess I just lost track of time. Today at the Kulturbund, I ran into Mr. Klein, the tailor. He's agreed to take you into his shop. I hear he has an excellent reputation. He gives the best pay. And in good time... he said he could make you a cutter. I appreciate it. Thank you. But I can't work at Mr. Klein's. You can't... or won't? Can't. I've won a place at the Academy of Fine Arts! What? That's wonderful! But how did this come about? I sketched a naked man. They liked it. But... Charlotte. You won't be able to hide the fact... That I'm a Jew? They know. - Here's to our Charlotte. Paula? Paula? I really am grateful. Oh... You silly girl. Do you think that's why I'm crying? You have no idea how hard a life in art is. Especially now. I was just trying to spare you the pain. Thank you, Paula. But I didn't ask to be spared. No... No, I suppose you didn't. Seek symmetry, seek harmony, and above all, do not deform what is already perfect. Heil Hitler. Manfred. Heil Hitler. What is the function of art? Barbara. Please, come to the front of the class. See how beautiful she is. There is nothing left for you to do except achieve precision. Precision before all things! That is our goal. To elevate. To celebrate. To inspire! You know you shouldn't be sitting there. I know. I haven't seen you at the apartment. They only let me use the studios after everyone's gone. Ah. Did you work well today? I produced another one of my "artistic deformities." Ha. That's how it is. You'll do harm to your soul with all their rules. Maybe you'll finally show me some of your work. You're clearly governed by strong emotions. Expressionism too. Yes! It's called "Death and the Maiden." Why did you do this? I don't know. I was just... thinking about my mother. Paula? No. My real mother. How did she die? Influenza. How old were you? Eight. Old enough to remember... and to feel her absence. It's as though she wants something from death. Something only he can provide. Are you the girl? Maybe. You can have it if you'd like. Then I must give you something in return. It's my experiences of the war. Weren't you too young to serve? I was 17. I barely survived. Read it, and you'll understand. Lotte? A letter's arrived for you from Ottilie Moore. What does she say? Gross mama and Grosspapa continue to be the perfect house guests. Then they must be grumbling only in their letters to us. Have you ever known Grosspapa to stifle his grumbling? I don't think she pays it any mind. Where did you...? Who is she? We saved you a piece of Augusta Sachertorte. Sweetheart... that's your mother's sister. Your aunt Charlotte. - I'm named after... - Yes. Your mother wanted to hon our her memory. Why was I never told about her? It was such a painful memory for your mother. How did she die? She drowned... in Lake Wannsee. It was such an unfortunate accident. How long were you going to keep this secret? It never seemed like the right time. Lotte, it's not easy for your father to talk about these things. You should understand. You're not a child. Precisely, Paula. I'm old enough to know the truth. What would Professor Koch say? What are the rules for this? I think you make them up as you go. That would terrify him. How can that be taught? Maybe not taught, but learned. At least they're not burning the paintings. Not yet. It's not only like they don't belong in the same room, but in the same building, in the same country, anywhere at all. That's the idea. I prefer those ones. I suppose I'm sick too. Well... The cure is worse than the disease. Ladies and gentlemen, the museum is now closing. - See you tomorrow? - Yes. Charlotte! Forgive me, I'm terribly late. - You missed the exhibit. - Oh, I've seen it. I wanted to see it with you, but sometimes... fate doesn't comply. Can I buy you a drink? Yes. So, what did you think of the exhibit? The Nazis have redefined the meaning of "degenerate". True art is about the chaos inside us. It's not for decorating dinner plates or advertisements. We also need dinner plates and advertisements. Yes! What do you think people would say, me bringing you to a place like this? Nobody needs to know. I've been thinking of your book. - Has it inspired you? - Yes, but it... also terrified me. Oh... I kept imagining what it would've been like to be buried alive. Even after the dug me out, I felt more dead than alive. I was the corpse who couldn't stop hearing the cries of other corpses. But in time, I realized that to rejoin the ranks of the living, I couldn't wait for life to love me. No. What matters is not whether life loves us... but that we love life. What is it? Your face... reveals all your feelings. I wish it didn't. Goodnight, Mr. Wolfsohn. Call me Alfred, won't you? Goodnight, Alfred. Oh. Charlotte Salomon? Please, come in. We should hurry, dear, if we want to be on time. Have a nice evening, Mr. Wolfsohn. Charlotte? Are you all right? Yes. Would you like to come with us? Mr. Wolfsohn, thank you. - Good evening. - Goodbye. Charlotte? What is it, Charlotte? I've been expelled from the Academy. So the bastards finally got tired of torturing you. You should be rejoicing! Not mourning. Come. Show me what you've been working on. Hm. You were thinking about my book when you drew this? Yes. I'm afraid to look into his eyes, for what I see there. The madness and terror I've been trying to escape. Would you illustrate my book for me? Really? Yes, you were meant to do it. Forgive me, but... I have to go. But meet me tomorrow. Spend the day with me at Lake Wannsee. I'd love to. And bring your bathing suit. What is it, Lotte? I love thunderstorms. Are you cold? No. Thunder and lightning have always cleansed the world best. This day is eternal. Because it's so wild and happy. Yes. Happiness runs much deeper than suffering. Don't you think? Mm-hmm. Do you paint happy moments, or... just the sad ones? The sad ones always feel more true. You'll wait for me there, dear? - Who was that? - Charlotte! Um... my fiancÃ©e. Who are you? Charlotte, I can explain. I made a promise to you. Oh, extraordinary. Jews will pay! - Heil Hitler! - Oh, my God! There's a way out back. Charlotte! Filthy kike. Jews! Get out of here, kikes! They're running like cockroaches. Germany for Germans! Dr. Salomon, you can't go out there. They're rounding up Jewish men all over the city. I have to get to the hospital. We can also help with the wounded. No! It's too dangerous. Let's not debate this now. Dr. Salomon. We would like to speak to Dr. Albert Salomon. Of course, gentlemen, I understand, and I don't want to waste any of your time, but he isn't here. - Stop talking! What a nice life you've made for yourselves here! Where is the Jewish swine?! I am Dr. Albert Salomon. Papa! My dear, everything will be fine. Look after your mother. Let's go! Papa! Papa! Charlotte. I walked nearly all the way from the camp. You can rest now, my darling. No, Paula. After Sachsenhausen, there can be no rest. - Albert! - Oh! Papa! Paula and I have been talking... It's nearly impossible to get exit visas to leave this forsaken place, but... but we can say your grandparents are sick, and that they need you. You'll pack light, no one can think you're leaving for good. You need me here, Papa. As soon as I'm well, I'll find a way for us to be reunited. Oh, Papa! It's for the best, my dear. I love you, Lotte. Charlotte! I have a feeling you'll be happy here. It's very beautiful. Grosspapa. It is good you are here, Charlotte. Your grandmother hasn't believed a word I've said about you coming. - Can I go to her? - Alexander! This is Charlotte Salomon, who I was telling you about. Hello, Charlotte. Welcome to France. It's nice to meet you. Why don't you carry Charlotte's bag to her quarters? Then walk her over to her grandmother. Of course. I hope you like it here. It can't have been easy leaving Berlin. Where are you from? Austria. I managed for a time with false papers, but in the end, I had to leave. And I found my way here. Adopted by Ottilie like the children and your grandparents. So, I'm also a refugee. Except I got here on foot over the Alps. My god. Compared to that, my trip here was a holiday. I wonder if you can take me to my grandmother now. She hasn't been well. Oh... British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain spoke to the House of Commons today declaring that any German attack on France would be regarded... - Gross mama? - ...as an attack on Britain, and would be delt with... Gross mama? It's me, Charlotte. Everything's all right, I'm here now. It's no use, Charlotte. How about we go outside? There's so much sun, so much light. Have you seen all the flowers in the garden? - No! No, no, no. - Oh... What's this? My god, she has the Veronal. - Veronal? - It's poison. What? For the day our money runs out. We don't live like beggars. What on earth are you saying? It's just life, Charlotte. It's nothing. Gross mama! - Lotte... - Gross mama, I've missed you. When I bought this house, it was on a whim. - Really? - On the face of it, it made no sense. This American woman by herself in such a big place... What for? I couldn't have guessed that one day, it would be so full of people. So full of life and purpose... and that I would only wish that it were... bigger. - Yes. Charlotte, dear! Thank you! The painting of the house is beautiful! She's right, it's a beautiful painting. Georges! Charlotte, meet my friends, Dr. Georges and Odette Moridis. - Nice to meet you. - And you as well. Dr. Moridis has helped take care of your grandmother. As much as your grandfather would allow. Doctors don't like to listen to other doctors. How is my grandmother doing? Walk with me, Charlotte. I do think she's doing better of late. In truth, your grandfather has made it very difficult for me to treat your grandmother. I'm not surprised. A couple of months ago, I had to give her morphine. She was having a psychotic episode. She kept saying she saw someone floating in the water. Has she been like that before? Not exactly. She doesn't let go of bad memories easily. Yes, I know. Try not to worry. Is everything all right? It's hard for older people to adjust. It's hard for everybody. I wish my grandfather would realize that what matters is not that life loves us, but that we love life. Don't you think that's true? Sure, it's just nicer when it works both ways. Care to dance? Good night. Bye. Charlotte, pack your things. We'll leave first thing tomorrow. What are you talking about? I can't care for your grandmother by myself, but since now you're here, we'll be on our way. And what if I don't want to go? Want? It is your duty to take care of your grandparents. It also says as much on your entrance visa. You would choose that scar face over us? Don't forget how you were raised. Yes? They're waiting. What is it? An announcement came over the radio not long ago. Britain and France have declared war on Germany. So... it's started. Your studio will be kept as you left it. Come back any time you feel the need. I would prefer regular mealtimes. And I'd prefer to be with Ottilie and the kids painting. You're not in this world just to paint, Charlotte. No, I'm mostly here to serve you. Gross mama? Marianne! No! Marianne! Oh... Oh, my dear. What have you done? Please... Let me die... I feel it. Please... Please. Let me die. You gave everyone a terrible scare. Thank you for coming. You mustn't do that again. Can you manage with all this, Lotte? Yes... I have to. The time to call is before something like this happens again. Don't hesitate. I'll try. Some tranquillizers for her nerves. Goodbye, doctor. Are you sure you don't want to return to Ottilie's? No, we can care for her ourselves. So you say. I suppose I will get this filled. For all the good it will do. I got a letter from Papa yesterday. He and Paula are safe in Amsterdam. When the war's over, we'll all be reunited in Berlin. Won't that be nice? Charlotte, my dear. You think you could get some flowers? They'd really cheer us up. I'll get you anything you want, Gross mama. I love you. And I love you too, sweetheart. No, no, Gross mama, no. Ah! Ah! Marianne! What have you done? How many times can a man endure this? What do you mean? First it was Georg... your grandmother's brother. He was studying law, he showed the first signs. He'd burst into hysterical laughter out of the blue. He drowned himself. His death drove your great-grandmother Teresa mad. For years, she tried to slip away from the nurses and take her life. She did horrifying things to herself. Incredible how she suffered. It was a relief when the woman died. During that terrible time, your mother was born. It's like a disease in the blood! Did she also kill herself? Your mother... She took opium from your father's medical bag, and when that didn't work, she threw herself out of a window. How could we ever recover? It was too much for her. Our Charlotte in the lake, then your mother jumped from the window. Too much! Too much! Don't! Charlotte? I feel it inside me. The same demon that haunted so many of my family. Sooner or later, the demon claims us. My aunt when she was a girl, my mother, my grandmother now. I'm going to paint the story of my life... of my family. It could take hundreds of paintings. And I don't know how much time I have left. None of us do. I will put everything I have into it, everything... beautiful, and everything hideous. Only by doing something mad can I hope to stay sane. Hey! Hey! I'm back. Oh... Thank you. Oh no. He was awful, wasn't he? I can't thank you enough for going there. Ah, it's nothing. I've endured worse. Another nasty, threatening letter? "Charlotte, you are required by law to live with me. If you stay away, I will call the police." Maybe it's time you went to stay with him again... just for a while. The last time I was there, those weeks... I felt like I was dying. I understand. Are you all right? I'm fine. Have a seat. Listen... I've decided to leave. I'm taking the kids to Spain. From there, we'll get to America. I want you both to come with us. Oh... Charlotte? Survive. Stupid Jew! Grosspapa! Hey, you! Stop! Scoundrels... Grosspapa! Grosspapa! Sir! Sir! Could you help us, please? Please! Grosspapa! Grosspapa! I'm very tired. Come. Come, Grosspapa. It's not far. I must return to Germany. Your Germany no longer exists, Grosspapa. I will call Dr. Moridis. No! I used to be a respected doctor. I had an intelligent wife, and two beautiful daughters. I had my books. Now I have nothing. You shouldn't think like that. Don't tell me how to think. I have nothing but a selfish, stubborn, granddaughter, only good for a few slapdash paintings. The best are gone, and I'm left with you. You. And how long before you kill yourself too? I'll have my dinner in bed this evening. It would've been better if that fall had killed me. What's this? An omelette? I would've liked something else. Me too. Some coffee, Charlotte. Of course, Grosspapa. You should take a break. Only when I'm done. Please, Alexander, have a seat. Okay, from what I can see... Charlotte is going to be just fine... and so is... the baby! Really? Congratulations! Do you know how many you've painted? Nearly a thousand. How many more will there be? I'm not sure, but I'm nearing the end. What do you call it? A play with music. Or a film in pictures. It's every memory from my life, including ones I didn't remember until I painted them. And some that never happened. But they're no less true. Has someone made something like this before? I don't know. Probably not. What does it feel like to do this? It's like... pulling something from yourself time and again. Like a splinter. The pain and the satisfaction of it. Hm. You must be a really great artist to make me sympathize with him. It's in the past, you have nothing to worry about. Is that so? Oh, that's good. Because... I was thinking, it might be nice if we got married. Is that your proposal? Charlotte, I love you. Will you marry me? Yes. All right... I've distracted you enough for one day. Professions? Groundskeeper. I'm an artist. Right. Papers, please. Not now, come back in ten minutes! Charlotte Salomon. Very good. Residence: 10 Avenue Victor-Cauvin. Ah. Uh... We have a problem, Mr. Nagler. What is it? You are not permitted to marry a Jew. It is forbidden. - I am a Jew. - Alexander... Then your papers are false. I'm aware of that. You realize I will be obliged to register you as a Jew? I will do the same in our city records. I understand. Go ahead. To all of you, for your warm friendship... Where would we be without it? And to all the friends and family who can't be with us today. I know they would want us to celebrate as if they were here, and to live for today. And be hopeful for tomorrow. Which is what we are all doing here. Celebrating life! And our faith... in life. So, to life! And, of course, to new life! And to peace. Don't forget peace. And to Ottilie... and the children. L'chaim, my darling. L'chaim. Could you spare a minute? - Of course. How did you manage to paint so many? I had to finish quickly. Time's running out. Please keep it safe. It's my whole life. Lotte. Ah... My God... It's so beautiful. Hey! That's for the cake! It's a surprise for Dr. Moridis. My mother used to make it when I was a child. I need more strawberries, would you mind? Not at all, my love. Nagler! Hands up! Hands up, I said! Where is Charlotte Salomon? I beg of you, stop! Alexander! Please, stop! No! No! Let me go! Charlotte! Get your hands off me, let me go!
