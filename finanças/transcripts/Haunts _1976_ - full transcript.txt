You've just been eating your bread and jelly. -Do you want two? -No, one's fine. -I didn't get any. -You didn't get any? -Here. -Have a biscuit, Eddie. -Come on, Eddie. Let's have just a little bit more beans. -I want more jelly. -Where's your please, Eddie? -Please. -Did you finish the jar? -Bridgette, go out to the pantry and get some more jelly? -Bridgette, please. -Why do I have to do everything? Eddie's finished, let him go. -If you're going to argue about it, I'll go get it myself. -Just because he's the baby. -Bridgette. -OK, OK. Boy, I'm a slave around here. -Oh, I forgot. -Bridget. -What? -Get some plum preserves too. -OK, OK. [SCREAMING] -What's the matter, [? baby ?]? [PHONE RINGING] [BABY CRYING] -Hello? It's for dad, mom. -Call back after 9:00. -She says it's an emergency. -How about that, huh? -It's little Lucille Bricker, what's left of her. -Oh my God. -Helman, get her out of here. -OK,OK come on everybody, let's get this show on the road. Come on, boys. Let's go. -Murder? -Would you please leave? There's nothing you can do do help around here. Let them through. -Helman, who did it? -Back off, will you? Come on, folks. -Think he raped her, Doc? -Yeah, it looks like it. We'll know better after the autopsy. -I've never seen anything like it. -Yeah. Well, I'll be at the hospital if you need me. -Right. -Come on, Dale. Move them out a little. -Sheriff, got a moment? -You'd better put that away. Here. -Some business, huh Doc? -Yeah. -You going to say something? -It'll keep. [ROOSTER CROWS] -Come on. That's good. OK, take it easy. No kicking, now. That's a good girl. That's a good girl. Having a good breakfast? [GATE SLAMS] -Carl? Is that you, Uncle Carl? Uncle Carl? -Yeah. -Was that you in the pantry? -No. Uncle Carl? -You know what? Sheriff's deputy said they found her hair in an old tin. They found one arm clear down by the lake. -Where have you been? I sent you out over two hours ago. SHOPPER: Be back tomorrow for them tomatoes. -I had a flat tire. -Flat tire? You expect me to believe that? Every other day you get a flat tire. -Do you want to get paid? -Oh right on, yes. -Everything's so expensive these days. -Hi, Ingrid. -Hi. -Sheriff's says it's a maniac. McPherson's been trying to organize the men but the sheriff says no, there's too many men with guns. If you ask me, I-- -No one's asking you now. Well, I think shootin's too good for a creature like that. Cut him up, just like he did that poor little Lucille. That's what I'd do. -Len. -What can I do for you ladies? -I don't think I could eat meat for a week. -How about some guts? -That's disgusting. -It's delicious. You've just got to know how to prepare. Maybe I can come up and give you a lesson sometimes. -Anytime, honey. You know where I live. -How about you, Miss Swenson? You going to join in the fun? INGRID: Oh no, not again. -Hello, Ingrid. -Oh, Sheriff Peterson. You scared me half to death. -I'm sorry if I frightened you, but I-- I've been checking the farms in the area to make sure that everybody keeps their windows closed and their doors locked. -Yes, I heard about all the terrible goings on. Would you like to come in? -Yes, thank you. Yeah. INGRID: How about some coffee, Sheriff? SHERIFF PETERSON: No thanks. You-- you got anything else? INGRID: Milk? SHERIFF PETERSON: OK, milk. You're some housekeeper, Ingrid. The floors are so clean you could eat right off them. You'll make some guy a really nice wife. -Would you like a sandwich? -No, I'll just have this and be on my way. Very good, Ingrid. -Sheriff? And idea who it is? -Not yet. All we found at the Olson apartment was a pair of scissors. -Oh? -I'm going to talk to Gordon for now. Have you noticed anything unusual around? -Unusual? -Yeah, you know what I mean. Someone hanging around. Strangers, hitch hikers, anybody that has no business up here. -No, nobody comes up here. Nobody at all, except for-- -That's enough. You were saying? -What? -I asked if anybody had been hanging around, -No, no one. -Except? -Oh, except-- except for when my old car breaks down and I can't get my groceries. Sometimes that boy from Mr. Louis's brings me my orders. -Frankie? -Yes. -Hm. Anybody else? -No, nobody else. -Ingrid, there's a maniac loose out there and times like these we-- we ought to keep an eye out for one another. You know what I mean? -Yes. -You see anybody suspicious, notice anything out of the ordinary, give a holler, huh? -I will, Sheriff. -You be careful now. -I will. Bye, Sheriff. Now where the devil are those scissors? (SINGING) Faith of my fathers, protect me from evil. Guard me from Satan's deception. An when I wander, stray from your glory, show me the light from your home in the sky. Father I long to go all around it, father I long to understand why. Cheer up, my children. Walk in the sunshine. We'll understand in [INAUDIBLE]. -Off. Good, really good. And it's thanks to the gentleman's section, we have a new addition to our choir, Mr. Bill Spry. And he doesn't sing off key like some of us do, does he everybody? OK, remember next week we've got prayer meeting after choir practice, so see you've got to be on time. OK? Goodnight. Everybody. -Goodnight and thank you. -Thank you. -Ingrid? I'd like you to meet a heck of a nice fellow. He's single too. -Hello, Ingrid. -Hello. -Why don't you both join Sally and me for a drink? -Would that be OK with you? -No, thank you. Uh, I'm sorry. It's getting late, and I don't drink. SALLY: Howard? -Oh, gotta go. War department's calling. BILL: OK, Howard. This is nice church you have here. Um, look, we could just talk over a Coke or something. I-- -No thanks. I already promised somebody. Margaret? Margaret? My car broke down. I don't dare to walk alone. -Oh, well maybe we can get someone to take us home. -No, no. Let's not. It's not very far. I don't mind if we walk together. -OK, I'll get my umbrella. -Excuse me, do you live near here? -No. Excuse me. -Margaret, come on. MARGARET: (SINGING) Open our hearts to your sweet-- what's so funny? INGRID: You are. MARGARET: Oh, that's good. Because I was doing it on purpose. Not like my substitute. Ugh, you ought to hear her play. INGRID: Why? Does she play like you sing? MARGARET: What do you mean by that? You know, some time I want to sing in the opera. (SINGING) Cheer up my children. Walk in the sunlight. You'll understand it. [CAR ENGINE REVS] MARGARET: Hey, that's Frankie. Hi. INGRID: Margaret, please. MARGARET: Maybe he'll take us home. INGRID: Margaret. MARGARET: Hi, Frankie. FRANKIE: Hey, what have we got here? What are you ladies doing out here tonight? INGRID: That's none of your business. -There's a murderer around here. Haven't you heard? Come on in here and I'll protect you from the Boogeyman. Maybe we can do some boogying ourselves. MARGARET: It's better than walking. -You go if you want to. MARGARET: Aw, come on, Ingrid. -No thanks. Some other time. -OK. Hey, Ingrid. Wait up. It's only a ride. -That's what you think. -Aw, come on, Ingrid. Don't you ever have any fun? -Oh, he's disgusting. The way he looks at me through those beady eyes, he makes me feel dirty all over. I don't trust him. -Funny how what's been happening can change everything. -It's not funny at all, Margaret. Lucille was raped and slaughtered. -See that's what I mean. You go around suspecting everybody. -Well, how can you help it knowing there's a maniac out there just waiting to jump on you. Lucky Uncle Carl is with me. MARGARET: Oh I didn't know he was in town. That's good. See, you won't be alone then. How long's your uncle staying for? INGRID: Oh, he just came a few days ago. A while, I hope. But with him you never know. MARGARET: Oh. Does he talk funny too? INGRID: No, he was born in America. And I don't talk funny. -You sound funny to me. -Well you sound funny to me. -Hey, what's he like? -Oh he keeps to himself a lot. -I'd like to meet him. -I don't think you would. -Why? What is he, the boogeyman or something? MARGARET'S MOM: Margaret? MARGARET: Yeah, mom. MARGARET'S MOM: Is that you? MARGARET: Uh-huh. MARGARET'S MOM: Who's that with you? MARGARET: Ingrid. MARGARET'S MOM: Oh, well come on in now and lock up after you. MARGARET: OK. You want to come in for a while? INGRID: No, I have a lot to do tomorrow. MARGARET: OK, goodnight. INGRID: Goodnight. [SCREAMING] -Uncle Carl. Uncle Carl, where are you? Uncle Carl. Uncle Carl, please answer me. Uncle Carl, Uncle Carl. Uncle Carl. -What's the matter child. -Oh, Uncle. I'm so glad you're home. -Ingrid, you're trembling. What is it? -Somebody's out there. He chased me. He tried to kill me. -Who tried to kill you? -I don't know. I couldn't see. It was too dark. -Calm yourself. It must be your imagination. It was probably only a rabbit or a deer. INGRID: No, it wasn't. It was a man. Where are you going? -To town. -But you can't. -Ingrid, please. You get a good night's rest. You tell me all about it tomorrow. -Please don't go. No. I won't let you go. You can't leave me alone. You don't understand. You can't go out there. The killer. If anything happened to you, I don't know what I'll do. -Ingrid, stop it. You have nothing to worry about. You're talking nonsense. There's nothing to worry about, nothing. -But there is. -Ingrid, do we have to go through this again? -You think I made it all up? -I think you need some rest. -Operator? Sheriff Peterson. [GAGGING] MRS. PETERSON: It's another one of them calls, honey. Should I ask her to call back? -Yeah? -Sheriff this is Ingrid. -Who? -Ingrid Swenson. That maniac? I mean, I didn't exactly see him. MRS. PETERSON: Here honey, OK? -He attacked me. SHERIFF PETERSON: You all right? -Yes, I'm OK. I'm home now. I got away. -Uh, did you lock all your doors? -No, I'll do that right now. SHERIFF PETERSON: Do that. I'll be by tomorrow at-- [SCREAMING] -Any of you creeps got a quarter? -Wait a minute. I'm just trying to help. -I don't mind if you do. Thanks. Not many gentleman in this crummy hall. Where you from? -I'm from Baltimore originally. -Hey, To-- hey, Tony. This guy's from Baltimore originally. TONY: All right, now. -Where are you from now? -Well right now I guess I'm from around here. -You know, nobody in this joint can dance. That's why I get a little rusty. What do you think? -Of what? Oh, oh, I thought you were very good. Really, you were very good. -You mean it? -Yes, I do. -Fact. Whoops. Baltimore originally, let's dance. -I'm sorry, miss. I don't dance. -Aw, Toby Mill. Oh come on, I could teach you. All you've got to do is wiggle a little bit. Right down here. -No, I said no. OK? -You're ticklish aren't you? -I said no. -OK. OK. Lots of things in life besides dancing, right Tony? TONY: Right, Nel. -Do you want to buy me a drink? -I'm sorry, I've got to go. -What's the matter? Come on, Baltimore. I thought you were a gentleman. Don't you like girls? -Don't you think you've had about enough? -What the hell kind of crack is that? -What's the matter, miss? -It's all right. I'm just giving her a little friendly advice. -Advice? My ass. Who the hell do you think you are? My father? Dumb creep. You've got no class leading me on like that. Go back to Baltimore, you dumb creep. -You ready for another? -No. Maybe just a little one. -Maybe two little ones? -Three little ones. Or four little ones? -Frankie Jamison, this is the second time this week you've kept me waiting. I swear to God, five more minutes and I was going home. I mean for good. -Dangit, woman. Don't you start bugging me now. I've got a headache, I'm tired, and I'm not going to deal with it tonight. -Well, I'm tired too. For God sakes, Frankie, I was out there over a half an hour. -Look, I've got to work. And sometimes I've got to work late. And when I do, don't you get uptight about it. -Well, it's just when I'm out there I start thinking things. -Like what? -Well like maybe you didn't mean those things you said about us. My God, what happened to you? -I-- I had an accident at the store. -Accident? What kind of accident? -An accident. I don't want to talk about it. Let's don't, all right? -That's bull. I don't know where you got that from. -Loretta, you don't know a damn thing. Now, if you're going to be in such a lousy mood, why don't you go home? -I don't want to. Hey, I'm sorry. I guess I'm just the jealous type. Here, I'll kiss it and make it better. -No. -What's wrong now? -I hate that baby talk. -I was only trying to be nice. -Well, why don't you try growing up? -That's the hundredth time you've told me that. Well, maybe I'm too young for you. Maybe you should find yourself an older woman. -Maybe I will. -Maybe you should go straight to Hell. I never want to see you again as long as I live. -What time is it? -Midnight. -Creep never even showed up. -Who you waiting for, Steve McQueen? -Shut up. You've got no class, Tony. I'm leaving. TONY: Goodnight now. Take it easy, huh? -Goodnight, Tony. You know, Tony? You've got about this much class. And I like you. -I like you too, Nell. -(ANGRILY) Dumb creep! -[WHISTLING] OK, OK, I'm coming. This is no restaurant, you know. Chickens first. [WHISTLING] Oh, stop that noise. I'm coming. I'm coming. OK, OK. My goodness. With all that noise, you'd think I would be starving you to-- [GASPS] [SCREAMING] -Did you pick up everything? -Yes, sir. -Good. Melvin. -Yes, sir. -Take these scissors to the lab, will you? And this time, be sure you don't get your fingers on them. -Yes, sir. Right sir. No problem, sir. -Helman, show some respect. -Yes, sir. -My God, it's like a butcher's shop. -Did you give Ingrid anything? -I already tried to, but nothing doing. -Well, maybe she knows best. You know, if I'd listened to her, maybe Nell would still be alive. -What do you mean? -Keep this under your hat, doc. But Ingrid called me last night and told me she was being chased by a man. Doc, everyone in this town has been calling me. My phone never stops ringing. Everyone thinks they're being chased, followed, going to be raped. I'd need an army to get all those calls answered. -So you thought it was just another scared woman imagining things. -Wouldn't you? -Anybody else, maybe. But not Ingrid. No, she's too down to earth. -Doc, you got any more of those pills you gave me the other night? -I think you'd better plan on seeing me at the office. -All right. -Doc, Sheriff, please sit down. -I've got to go file the death certificate. Are you sure I can't give you anything? -No thank you, Doc. The Lord will heal me in his time. -Yes. Well, you call me if you need anything. -Ingrid, I-- I want to apologize for not coming over last night after you called. -Sheriff this had nothing to do with you. The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. -Yeah, well amen. -Amen. Goodness, look at me sitting here. Let me get you something. -No, don't trouble yourself. -No trouble at all, Sheriff. -Ingrid, can you think of anyone who might have taken the scissors from your sewing basket? -No, no one. -Are you sure? -Yes. Please sit down, Sheriff? I'll get some clean fruit. -No, no, never mind. I've got to go. -I'm sorry I can't be of any more help. -I'm sorry too. You look like you need some rest. I'll have Mr. Lewis and Frankie up to help you with the chores. -No, I don't want that boy up here. I'm fine, really. -Whatever you say. Ingrid, did you go to church yesterday? -Yes, to choir practice. Why? -Did you happen to meet a fellow there by the name of Spry? -Yes, I did meet somebody. That sounds like it could be him. Do you think he did it? -I don't know. You take care of yourself. If you need me for anything, just call and I'll be right over. -All right. (SINGING) Father I want to know all about it. Father I want to understand why. -Ingrid, Ingrid, wait. Ingrid, Ingrid, please let me in. Please, I can explain. Ingrid. -Yes, yes, you're absolutely right. Too much attention to the dead, not enough to the living. That's the trouble with this world today. OK, OK. [GASPS] [SCREAMS] [CRIES OUT] Please, no. No. No. [SCREAMING] UNCLE CARL: Ingrid, are you OK? -Yes, I'm OK. UNCLE CARL: You're not still mad at me, are you love? -No, Uncle. I'm not mad. -Don't you worry about a thing. I'll take good care of you. That's why I'm here for, you know. Sleep tight now, love. I'll see you in the morning. -Not a word to anybody. If you do, I'll be back. And the next time, I'm not going to be so gentle. [CRYING] FATHER MARX: How can I absolve you from your sin if you don't tell me what it is? -God knows it wasn't my fault, Father Marx. God knows. FATHER MARX: God knows everything, Ingrid. But if I am to help you, I too must know. Child, silence will keep the dark cloud of sin hanging over you. You don't want to be kept out of the kingdom of Heaven. -No. -Go on. Speak. -I feel so dirty. -Yes, yes. Confess your sins and beg God's repentance. -Pray for me, father. -Let us pray together. You are riddled with sin, child. Open your heart. Show all the filth and blackness inside. Pray to him. He alone has the power to purify and absolve. To wash you clean with the blood of his only begotten son. Say you, Christ will save me. -Christ will save me. -The blood of the lamb will purify me and make me clean before the Lord. -The blood of the lamb will purify me and make me clean before the Lord. FATHER MARX: Wait for me in the rectory. Continue to pray, child. Continue to pray. Stay as long as you like. -I didn't mean to do her any harm. You've got to believe me. -She's a Christian child. You forced her to become a victim of your lust. Know what you must do? Go to the Sheriff and speak to him. -I can't do that. -There's no other way. -Yeah, Father. [RUSTLING IN BUSHES] [SCREAMS] -Who is out there? Mrs. Ingals, please. [SCREAMS] [CRYING] -Oh my God. NURSE (ON PA SYSTEM): Doctor Mollard, telephone please. Doctor Mollard, telephone. -Hello. Where's Ingrid? -She's in room 112. -How is she, Doc? How's it possible? -I don't know. It just doesn't seem to add up. -Maybe he just didn't have a chance to give her the full treatment. How bad is she? -I've got her under sedation now, but she'll be OK. -When will I be able to talk to her? -Well, she says her uncle can take care of her, so I'll send her home in the morning. Oh, I almost forgot. Maybe you can find something in here, earth particles we found under her fingernails. -Sheriff Sheriff, could I talk to you for just a moment? -Father Marx. If it's something that will keep I'd just as well-- -It would just take a moment. -Sheriff this is very difficult for me. Did the young man Frankie talk to you? -No. About what? -He hasn't? Well then, Sheriff, I guess it's important that you know. Your daughter Loretta. -What about Loretta? -She is, uh-- carrying Frankie's baby. Sheriff, if there's anything you would like me to do. -No, Father, thank you. -Goodnight. SHOPPER: Goodnight. [SCREAMS] -Hey Keith, come on out here. [SCREAMS] POLICEMAN: You there, stop! You OK, Pam? SHERIFF PETERSON: Open up. FRANKIE: What the hell are you doing? You've got no right to come into my house. -I've got all the right. -What the hell are you doing? Are you crazy? -Shut up. -You're sick. I swear to God, you're sick. -You dirty little whore. -Dad, what did you do that for? -I'm booking him for rape and assault. Now you get home. -No, Daddy. Please no. -You damned foot. Do you know what could have happened to you? You could end up with your throat cut, that's what. -You're crazy, Sheriff. There's no way I'm going to hurt Loretta. -Dad-- -You shut up. Where did you go after work the other night? -I went for-- I went for a ride. -You're a damn liar. -With Loretta. -It's the truth, dad. Honest. -You keep out of this, you year? [PHONE RINGS] -Hello? KEITH (ON PHONE): Sheriff? You there with Frankie? -Of course I'm here with him. Where the Hell do you think I am? -Better not book him yet. -Why not? KEITH (ON PHONE): We got the killer cornered down at the sawmill right now. -Are you sure? KEITH (ON PHONE): Lester saw him. He nearly got him. -Frankie, we better tell him. -No. Just let me handle it. POLICEMAN (ON PHONE): Might be some fireworks. -I'll be right over. Get in the car. -No. -I said get in the car. -Really tough, aren't you? -Stay away from her. POLICEMAN: Hey, there he goes. -Freeze! REPORTER: Can we be absolutely certain that this was the man? -Oh, absolutely. -But who is this man? Where did he come from? -We just got verification from Rockfield State Prison that he was a psychopathic killer. He's been wanted for quite a while. -So as far as you're concerned then, Sheriff, this case is closed? -That's what I think. -Thank you. -Thanks very much, Sheriff Peterson. REPORTER (ON TELEVISION): Thanks, Bob. Well folks, it looks like the long nightmare is over. Here in our newsroom, we have discovered that Bill Spry came to the area approximately three weeks ago. He has been working as a handyman. To his neighbors, Bill Spry appeared to be a quiet, good natured, decent young man. Whatever madness caused him to rape and murder, we'll never know. -Oh no. Dear. REPORTER (ON TELEVISION): The one thing that we can be grateful for, Bill Spry will not be searching for innocent victims in this town tonight or any other night. -They're making a terrible mistake. REPORTER (ON TELEVISION): Now to the weather. Oh, sorry folks. I don't care where you're going-- -Loretta, I've got to talk to your dad. Is he home? -No, he ain't. -Please, it's terribly important. Where can I find him? -What do you want him for? You want to tell him more lies about Frankie? -No I mean, I never lied in my life. -Oh come off it. Who do you think you're kidding with all that prim and proper stuff? You've got the dirtiest mind in town. All those lies you've been spreading about Frankie. You're just jealous because you can't have him. Look at you. You're nobody, nothing. You're old enough to be his mother. -Oh, I'm sorry. I-- -Just get out of here and leave us alone. -Truth. I've got to find truth. There, that's it. They can just match the fingerprints on-- on the buttons. I'll show them. Uncle Carl. Uncle Carl. Now they'll have to believe me. I've got proof. FRANKIE: [LAUGHTER]. Proof? Proof, Ingrid? What kind of proof? -Mm. Mmm. -Is this your proof, Ingrid. -No. -Shut up. -Mm. Mm. [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [SCREAMS] [GROANS] -Ingrid. Ingrid. Ingrid! -Uncle Carl. -It's all right now. Everything is all right now. INGRID: [CRYING] I've got to call the Sheriff. -No. Why be foolish? -But the Sheriff has to know. Frank is the one. -Why? The Sheriff didn't believe you before. Why should he believe you now? You're the only one who can be harmed. -What do you mean? -You killed Frankie? -I didn't mean-- -People only believe what they see. The Sheriff sees the body, he'll punish you. -What shall I do? -Leave everything to Uncle Carl. -[GASPS] Out. -Ingrid, wait. Ingrid, don't go. Please. They can't understand. There's just you and me. There's no one else. Ingrid. Ingrid. They'll never believe you. Come back, please. You need me. You need me. -But how can you be sure he was going to kill you? -I just told you. He raped me. -Ingrid, where's Frankie now? -I-- I-- -The truth, Ingrid. -Uncle Carl buried him. But he only did it to protect me. You won't hurt him, will you? -No, no. No, no. We won't hurt hum. -Ingrid, are you afraid he might hurt you? -No, he wouldn't hurt me. I'm all he's got. He needs me. We're very close, but not in a dirty way, of course. -You mean, he wouldn't rape you? -No. Sometimes he scares me half to death with the crazy things he does, but he wouldn't do that. -What kind of crazy things? -I don't know if I can tell you everything. -Then just tell us as much as you can. -Well, sometimes-- sometimes he disappears for the longest time and he doesn't tell me where he's going. He uh-- he doesn't want to worry me though, and he always comes back. I-- dear Lord-- I told you, he loves me. He loves me. He loves me. He loves me. LESTER: Hey Keith, they find her uncle yet? KEITH: No, the Sheriff issued an all points for him though. Hey come on Lester, let's that damn grave and go home. I don't want to be out here all night. You go check over there by the barn. I'm going this way. -Ingrid, do you have any idea where the body is? -I couldn't see. KEITH: Sheriff? -Excuse me, Ingrid. KEITH: [MUMBLING] -Ingrid, it's too dark for them to see anything out there. They'll have to come back in the morning. (WHISPERING) Tell Lester to be here bright and early. I'd better stick around here tonight. Thanks, Keith. -Sheriff-- the last thing Uncle Carl said was that you wouldn't believe me. Do you believe me? -I really don't know what to believe. -I s -Don't worry, Ingrid. If there's anything you need, I'll be right here. [HORN HONKING] [ROOSTER CROWING] [HORN HONKING] -You make enough noise to wake up the dead. -You said bright and early, Sheriff. -OK, OK. -Look, drive around the back. If you find anything, give a yell. -Yes, s-- oh. Sheriff, what do you think it looks like? -What? -The grave. -How the hell should I know? A grave's a grave. Use your head. And Helman, Helman, take it easy, will you? The lady's still asleep. -Right. Right, Sheriff. -Sheriff, hey Sheriff. Come here quick. Take a look at this. It's her goat. -Oh geez. Oh geez. FATHER MARX: Oh Lord, we entrust to you the soul of our dearly departed sister. We pray that you will gather her up in loving mercy so that she may find everlasting peace in the bosom of our lord, Jesus Christ. May the agony of her death atone for her sins. Her suffering in this veil of tears and madness is at an end. Praise the Lord. ONLOOKERS: Amen -Goodbye, dear Ingrid. We will meet again when we are all united on that distant shore to which we are all bound. For dust we are, and to dust we shall return. ONLOOKERS: Amen. -You're Carl Anderson, Ingrid's uncle, aren't you? -Sheriff Peterson. I got here as soon as I could. Could we talk? -Certainly. UNCLE CARL: I appreciate your calling me, Sheriff. How'd you locate me? SHERIFF PETERSON: We found your number on Ingrid's night table. How was your trip? UNCLE CARL: I almost didn't make it. The New York airports were all fogged in. I was lucky to get a flight out of New Hampshire. It's a terrible shock, Sheriff. A terrible shock. SHERIFF PETERSON: It's a damn shame, Mr. Anderson. I'm really sorry about your niece. -Sheriff, could you tell me exactly what happened? -We're still trying to figure it out. She always seemed so-- so level headed. All of a sudden she comes out with these wild stories about being raped. -Wild stories? What do you mean wild stories? -Well, Mr. Anderson. Your niece Ingrid, she died a virgin. -A virgin? -Yeah. The doctor confirmed it twice. First when she claimed she got raped but Frankie, and then again at the autopsy. -Then you mean she made up everything? The attacker, Frankie, everything? -No, no, no, she was attacked all right. She managed to get away. The way I figure it, that's when she started loosening her bolts, you know? Then when she found Nel right in her own backyard, she completely flipped. You OK, Mr. Anderson? -Yes, yes, thank you. Tell me about-- what about this Frankie? -He never l hand on her. UNCLE CARL: Never? -Never. We found that out later, of course. We analyzed the particles under her fingernails and it was her own hair, he own flesh, her own blood. -You mean-- you mean she did all that to herself? -Yeah. -Oh my God. -I'm sorry, Mr. Anderson. Those are the facts. -Oh my God. My God. -If only Esther had lived. -Esther? Who's that? -My sister, Ingrid's mother. She also committed suicide. SHERIFF PETERSON: Well how old was Ingrid then? -She was uh-- five. Her parents both died the same week. -My God, both? -Her father's death was-- was an accident. SHERIFF PETERSON: We're they very close? -No, she hated-- she hated him. My sister hated him. She was beautiful, and tender, and kind. He never truly appreciated her. SHERIFF PETERSON: I meant, were Ingrid and her father very close? -What? -Ingrid and her father. -No, no, he was-- he was rarely home. -I see. And her mother? And her mother? -Uh-- close. Very close. Very close. I don't think we ever got over it. -Mr. Anderson, when was the last time you visited with Ingrid? -I never did. Why? -You never did? -Never. -The way she talked, you were with her up until the last minute. -Well, she often asked me to visit her at the orphanage and later at the house. SHERIFF PETERSON: Orphanage? -Yes. After my sister-- after her parents died, Ingrid spent 13 years at the-- that European orphanage up the coast. -Hm. UNCLE CARL: Well, I-- I did write her from time to time. I sent her money every couple of months. -Looks like she needed more than that. I just wish there was something we could have done. -Nothing anybody could've done. The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. -Yeah, well amen. SHERIFF PETERSON: So long, Mr. Anderson. Good luck to you. UNCLE CARL: Bye Sheriff. Thank you for everything.
