Choreographer JUNG Doo-hong Production Designer MIN Eon-ok On top of the crisis with the Ming envoy coming early? Young-san Port? Isn't that Yook-son's territory? I'll send word to Yook-son asking for a wagon and some porters. Sound Design KIM Suk-won Synchronous Recording OH Se-jin I'll send word to Yook-son asking for a wagon and some porters. Will you go there tomorrow and take charge? Then you'll have to spend all the money we borrowed. What about you, Ocho? Costume Designer JUNG Kyung-hee Make-up by HAN Pil-nam What about you, Ocho? The boat probably didn't come in at Gam-po 'cuz of the drought. Who do you think I am? 'Course I took care of everything. Don't worry. But that bloody, bastard port chief! Said his mom starved to death! I had to give him 20 pence more to get the goods out! Those bastards! Hope he falls down the dung hole and drowns! Ocho. Isn't your baby almost due? Yes, why? Just worried your kid will start cursing right from birth. Producer LEE Seung-ryoul Aw, come on. The chief's sacrifice to the gods. I pray to the gods of heaven and earth. Please watch over our merchant band's deals with Ming to go well. Directed by KIM Yoo-jin I'll give you some after serving all the guests. Go on! Go. Not on a day like this. Come here. It's because of you, they're always wanting more. Damn woman, you hit hard! Eat it before anyone sees you. Always so lovey-dovey, you make me jealous. Oh please, sir. The meat smells so good. A monk raving over meat? How will you seek enlightenment like that? Enlightment? It's no big deal. It's all about eating and living anyway. Anyway, looks like your clan is growing by the day. At this rate, you'll rake in all the money in Joseon. Then you won't feel shame in taking up offerings. I guess. Care to give it a try? How many to win? Shoot through three. Three it is. This brassware belongs to me, now. Monk Geum-oh! Wait a minute, sir. Baby arrows aren't easy to shoot even for men! I'll take this. Thank you. I'm Su-ryeon. As pretty as a water lily, I see. You make me blush, my lord. Will you make a lily bloom in my arms? Philandering as always, I see. By the looks of your complexion the court's power must not be so bad. Your spite is sure to wither it away. Then I take back what I just said. How can a mere merchant, like me, be safe in offending the royal army chief. So this is the sword bestowed by the King? What a beauty. Joseon's finest sword! Careful with that. Allow me to serve, sir. No, thanks. Leave us, everyone. I hoped we'd never have to meet again. Someone will come to you late in the night. Allow the guest to stay with you for now. Just keep the guest quietly out of anyone's sight. Sir Chang-kang! Is that a request or an order? Of course it's not an order. I'm asking, as a favor. I have to watch someone and can't even ask why or who they are? I am Hong-li. Greatly obliged, sir. I'm Sul-ju. My house is yours, my lady. Escort her inside. Yes, sir. This way, ma'am. Who is it that we're using all these expensive goods for? Don't know. Isn't she pretty? Damn lucky. Hurry it up! Forgive me for not protecting you, chief. Moo-seng! Leave now! Hurry! You too, Chief! Let's go! No! I must stay! No, father! Hong-li! Don't do this! Hong-li! Now only you can make the Singijeon. You must live and complete the Divine Weapon! No! I'm not leaving! Moo-seng! No! Let me go! Forgive me comrades. Father! Don't do this! No! Father! Ming Delegates?Residence Damn it. What does it say? - The Ming merchants didn't come. - What? - I don't believe this! - Bloody hell! The envoy has arrived, Your Majesty. In place of Emperor Bow four times then stand! Bow! Up! Bow! Up! Stand! Behold the message of the Emperor. Be seated! Listen ye insolent Joseon! You have gone against my wishes and shown contempt repeatedly. First, you have repeatedly attacked the premises of the borders. Second, you sent useless tributes, which can only be considered your mockery of me. Third, you took 3,000 Yeo-jin people without permission. And you have disrespected me. Trusting in the seas and mountains that surround you, You do felonious deeds. Fear! Do not force me to punish you with the great Ming army! Damn mother! Cursing! Son of a bitch! The banquet is about to begin, please hurry, Your Majesty. What? Listen ye Insolent Joseon? Damn mother cursing son of a bitch! Damn mother cursing son of a bitch! The envoy came without merchants? That doesn't make sense! No Chief JIN nor the merchants. No one came. We're ruined. We must get back what we can. How? I'll try to make a deal and try to make at least half. Half? After all the money we spent? We only have 10 days till our payment due date. If we don't act fast, we'll lose even that half! I knew it! Big deals don't come that easy! See? I warned you all! Damn it! That temper of hers! In-ha, think of what'll happen when you marry her. Don't worry, chief. A real man's heart is wider than the seas. I'll just be wise and stay submissive. That's it. Just laugh it up. Cheer up. It's not a complete loss. ... Damn... He's right. Let's cheer up. And sell everything but your wife if you can! You crazy? We should sell our wives first! Who'll buy 'em? Chief Moo-seng? Chief Moo-seng? Chief Sul-ju? I've looked everywhere. She's gone. Damn it. Where'd she go? I'll round up some men and search some more. Forget it! No need to make a fuss. Bang-ok? Get Pan-su and Ocho. Damn it! I've got enough to worry about! Ah, brother? You disappear, turn my house upside down, then calmly ask me to take in another man? My lady, I would hardly call that proper. It was an emergency, sir. I apologize. He is your brother, you say? Yes. Fine, then. But you mustn't go out again. I can't take any more responsibilities over you. Of course, sir. Goodnight, sir. In-ha? Do they look alike? No. Not at all, right? - A brother? Bloody hell. - Chief! A report from Eui-ju-bu. The Ming army has passed Byung-jang and is moving into the Pa-juh valley. That means they're heading into the borders. Yes, Your Highness. It's probably a routine military training. Ming is preparing an army after sending an envoy? We don't know what they're really up to yet, So let's keep this quiet. Yes, Your Highness. The royal army chief is here to see you, Your Majesty. Did you find out? Yes, Your Majesty. Kaoling who came with the Chamberlain heads the royal intelligence. - The Emperor's secret army? - Yes, sir. Then the warriors disguised as delegates are all royal intelligence? Yes, Your Majesty. They are keeping watch on everyone in the court, Your Majesty. Villainous fools. Not only that, there are firearms supervisors among the delegates. And what about Ga-song's daughter? I've arranged a safe place for her to stay. Well done. Well done. Here. Thank you. Oh, the sesame. I said I'll do it! I want to show my appreciation. I should do it myself. Not once have I waited on someone during the 10 years I have been here. I thought you and the chief were siblings. No one in this house shares a single drop of blood. I see. I don't know what your business is in coming here. But stay low and out of trouble. And don't egg on my brother! Got that? It's to thank you and apologize for worrying you, sir. I wanted to show my appreciation. It's really nothing, my lady. Cooking comes from the heart. It may not be much but I prepared it with utmost care. It's really good! Delicious! The virtuous eat food with heart. And the vulgar eat for hunger. How can I not appreciate your caring deed. Thank you, sir. By the way... Yes, my lady? I'd like to stop by my house. Why so? I must retrieve some important things there. Then let's go. Now? Strike while the iron is hot. Let's go, now! I shall go with you. I'll be fine. Don't worry. No need to trouble yourself, sir. You look lovely in any attire, my lady. Thank you, sir. Let's make haste. If you're going against your family's wishes with him and... - I mean if your relationship is... - Are you that curious? - Well... - Yes, you're right. He must be her brother. This is your house? - Why leave a house like this and... - Shh! Let's go. Looks more like she came to steal something. In-ha! Take Bong-gu and go back. Let go! No! Any deeper and he could've died. Who are you? We cannot say. Who were they? I do not know. What did they steal from you? No need to know, sir. A brother almost died because of you! What can be more important than a person's life! What is it! I'm sorry, sir. Lock them up and don't give them anything until they start talking! The Singijeon Manual... Is this the secret firearm Joseon calls the Divine Weapon? Such detailed records. The design and concept is astonishing. 1 inch, 3cm, 2mm... An inch is about the width of a finger stub. Then how big is a millimeter? About the width of a sheet of paper, sir. How can that be measured? With this. It can be measured like this. What kind of firearm is this... to use such precise measurements? I cannot be sure. But perhaps it's similar to our incendiary arrows? But they're not effective in war and we stopped developing them. But it looks similar to them. But the strange thing is... Enough! It's hard to tell what it is, yet. With the complex calculations and precious measurements... It is clearly different from anything we've seen thus far. The girl is still alive. If they tried to take this taking such great risks, that means the weapon is still being developed somewhere. That's right. Coming. Steward? Who are you? I came to meet the royal army chief. Master Chang-kang hasn't come home from the palace in over 2 weeks. What will you do with the woman? Why? I have a bad feeling about this. Send her away. The court was secretly developing a new weapon. But word reached Ming and many died including Hong-li's father, Sir Ga-song. That is why the envoy is here. To stop Joseon from making the weapon. So that's why the merchants didn't come this time? Damn it. We'll all die 'cuz of the bloody nation's affairs. - Look. - Forget it. Take the two people in my house as early as possible. Please make the gunpowder. Everyone in the court is being watched by Ming. If you help Hong-li and make the weapon, you'll be free to do business with the court. And also have trading rights with Ming and Japan. This is the deed to my promises. You know how to do business. But too bad. I was born too low in class to have what it takes to handle such big tasks. Do you still hold a grudge for what happened with your father? A grudge? Is that what you call it! Be informed sir, I'll send Hong-li and Moo-seng to a temple in Su-lak. Make the gunpowder. Disobey and you shall die! Get back! He is no match for you. Stop! You do not have a choice! The fragrance of the pines is refreshing to the mind. Really? I heard you are Joseon's top warrior and so I wanted to meet you. No, sir. I've yet much to learn. I heard there was a strange explosion outside the capital not long ago. An explosion? That's news to me. Really? Then I must've been misinformed. The delegates must be misinformed. We've always reported the slightest changes to our armies to the Emperor. That is true. Joseon's loyalty and reverence to Ming are well known in the palace. I had no idea. Then it's all thanks to you Chamberlain. A modest prince from a humble nation, I see. Unlike wild dogs running around not knowing their place. A dog's luck is the happiest luck, sir. Geum-oh might seem like a depraved monk. But he is famous for giving great services for the dead. I told him about your father's passing... There's no need for small talk as you send someone away, sir. You speak with such venom. A bitter tongue is sure to ruin a lovely face. It is a decent language for a peddler who can't tell right from wrong. A peddler? You neglect our nation's problems and only think of your own wealth! You are nothing but a petty merchant! That's a little harsh, lady. The Royal Armory Chief's son! Are you not ashamed before your late father? Though he died falsely charged, he was a great man. How dare you speak of my father. Did you scheme with Chief Chang-kang before coming to me? Of course not! But had I known you to be a coward, I would never have come at all. That's enough! But this is for our entire nation! Our entire nation? How valiant! I guess you too will be remembered as a loyal subject. How can a petty merchant like me ever fathom something so great? Who are you! What are you doing here! What fool put you up to this! I'm the fool! Where's that rat Ocho hiding? What brings the greatest merchant in the land to our humble abode? Ask Ocho why! Go on. Hurry it up! Damn. Get the hell out you bastards! Scram! You bastard! You son of a bitch! Bastard! You idiot! Arrest them all! Crazy bitch! I knew there was something fishy! How can only the Gam-po goods come in smoothly in the drought? Why did you borrow money from him you idiot! He's the biggest rat there is! He was the only one I could find. The stupid idiot. Damn it! We're both merchants. Let's try to strike a deal. Please give us 2 months. What the hell are you talking about? The deal was already done when Ocho signed on it. What you're doing is mere groveling. Fine. Then I'll grovel. Please let my people go. Well, then. There's no use in talking. See him out! Next! We'll be on the streets 'cuz of him anyway! I'll round up some men, kill him, and get our stuff back! In-ha! We're not thieves. What will you do there with no workers to help? Let's consult with the royal army chief, first. I can find people there. You know we can't do anything with the Singijeon Manual gone. What's this? It's a gunpowder flask. Chief Ga-song perfected it? Yes, my father did it. All we have to do is recreate it just like this. Wonder how the men stuck in jail are doing. Hope they're getting enough to eat. Does it amuse you to kick a man when he's down? Sure does! If you weren't a monk, I'd... Stop being stubborn and go see Chief Chang-kang. Remember how our fathers died? Falsely accused of treason. Your dad made gunpowder and mine made bows and swords. And they were Goryeo descendents. The perfect targets. How can you ever forget that? That's why I became a monk. It must be nice to have a hollow head. Fool. Is that tree from Goryeo or Joseon times? Stop with your nonsense, already! Going somewhere this late at night? Yes, sir. There's something I must not delay any longer. Till we meet again, my lady. Lady Hong-li? So what is this new weapon? Left winds. Turn to right! Left winds. Turn to right! Distance, 400 ft. Height, 1 yard. Pretty scary. Shh! Arrows flying out by themselves? What is this? That's the Singijeon. We will make it shoot 100 arrows. What happens when 100 arrows like these fly over and explode? Everyone on the other end will die. That's right. If this is perfected, we'll enter a new era in warfare. We built this in preparation for the worst. It'll take a lot to start up. It has all the equipment we need. It should be easy. Oh, really? Just as I promised. I brought the gold and silver like you asked. This is all I can do. I need more money. Double, at least. That was not part of the deal. You have no choice, Chief... How can you back out of your word like that! Do you have saltpeter? - No. - How about charcoal? We'll make it! - And sulfur? - We'll get some. No materials for gunpowder and no workers? That's why he gave you so much from the start! That's a pretty good business deal! We do business to make even more money! A virtuous man acts for righteousness. But my top priority is to make a profit. Thus it is only natural for a man like me to want more. Okay. I'll give you the rest after the work is completed. Agreed. But you must see to it getting done! Of course, sir. It is the end for a merchant without reliability. Sir, this is a matter of utmost importance. It cannot be done with any ill intentions. But he is trying to make profits at the expense of our nation. I think you've chosen the wrong man. Does he even know how to make gunpowder? Trust me. Just one question. What's your relationship with Chief Chang-kang? Oh, please! Always curious about relationships! Wow! Where'd all this money come from? First, we need to find men to work here. You each go out and get 5 men to work under you. Don't worry. That's easy as a pie. Look, Pan-su. This can turn out to be the price for our lives. Developing weapons is a very dangerous job. We must become one and work together. This isn't a job to make profits off of. Let's just divide up the tasks. Pan-su and Ocho take charge of general affairs. In-ha and Bang-ok are in charge of the food and snacks here. And Yoo-bong is in charge of the charcoal. Okay. Charcoal must be made from willow trees. I know that much. Then let's work as 'One' like the Chief said and get this done! Can we get any closer? Our biggest problem is collecting saltpeter. We need a lot of people to do that. But that would draw suspicions. Any ideas? Secretly mobilizing many people? I'm the best for that job. But I get that much more when this is over. You've got quite the appetite. Where do you store all the money? There are many monks with big appetites. I am still famished. By the way, what is saltpeter? Listen carefully. The wet, black dirt under the eaves... That's saltpeter. - May Buddha be with you. - May Buddha be with you. Where do you want the rest? You stupid fool! What was that for? This is no willow tree. It's oak! Sorry, sir. I need to check the measurements. It's right there. The wheel here is... It's more accurate to measure with a rope than a ruler. - Send down the water. - Yes, Chief! Your Majesty. Our soldiers are being slaughtered by those Joseon fools and their weapons. Grant me an army. How powerful are their weapons? A step ahead of ours, Your Majesty. And they are developing new weapons! But Joseon is merely a small nation. He is right. A war isn't decided on a few weapons. Nonsense! Joseon has long been a threat. We must not let them have the slightest power! Got that? Understood? It is urgent! Grant me an army, Your Majesty! Gather an army as you wish and await my orders. Yes, Your Majesty. The prince and royal army chief are engaged. Leave the palace to me, sir. I'm keeping a close watch. Any word on the sulfur? Tell him. Well, ah... Yes, sir. A Japanese merchant secretly brings it in because there's not much in the country. This is her? Don't worry, sir. I got my men out in every market and village. That'll do. Report to me at once if you find her. If you step in, they'll go deeper into hiding. Understood? You'll be needing this. No need, sir. I'm doing this for our country. With faithful subjects like you our two countries would be at peace. It is only right that the smaller nation serve the larger. Right you are. Why are you throwing away the precious saltpeter? You really don't know? Or are you testing me? Test you? Of course not, sir. Follow me. Taste it. Taste the others, too. They all taste different. Salty, sour, bitter, spicy... Only the spicy and bitter saltpeter, have explosive power. Really? Didn't the late great chief tell you how to sort saltpeter? I learned the basics but the secret to gunpowder is so dear... my father didn't even tell me. And I told you the secret for free. A diamond in the rough. You have a lovely complexion. I know I do, sir. Right... What are you doing? - Nothing. - Oh, really! Are you flirting with me, sir? Go see Hasekawa at Okryu Tavern out the East Gate. Isn't that in the red-light district? There are many pretty courtesans there. So go relieve yourself. I got spies on Ito and Tamakuchi's merchant bands. I'll be sure to get them when they're on the move! Bastards! I've come at the request of Lady Hong-li. Lady Hong-li? We need some sulfur. I'm sorry, sir but, We don't know anyone by that name nor do we deal with sulfur. Come on, now. Stop being stubborn. How can you trust her? She seemed very suspicious. We can't do anything without sulfur. We have no other choice. Please hurry. What a stubborn woman. Suspicious men have been asking around for sulfur these days. I'm very sorry. No need. We understand. Take what I have for now and I'll give you the rest when the shipment comes in. Thank you. How can I ever repay you? I have a favor to ask, too. Can you get a book from Goryeo's collection of Sutras? - The Great Buddhist Sutras? - That won't be easy. I just need the Diamond Sutra. My mother is a devout follower. It won't be easy. But I promise to get it to you. Thank you very much, sir. How much for the sulfur then? No, please. No need to pay me, sir. If you'll excuse me. How will you get that book? A merchant always strikes a deal first then thinks of the method later. What is this? This is Akiko's hairpin. Akiko's hairpin? It's a coral dragon hairpin. That is correct. Akiko is the most famous geisha in Japan. Whatever she wears, all women follow. Thank you. Not at all. Thanks to Sir Ga-song I've been able to live here. I owe him my life. That's him. He's the one asking around about sulfur. Pour me a drink, woman. She is a new girl I brought in especially for you, sir. What do you think? Not bad, isn't she, sir? She's pretty... What brings you here, sir? Having fun even after going broke? We all need a little fun in life. Here. Have a drink, girl. - No thank you. - Arrogant wench. I shall serve you, sir. Fancy, how pretty you look trying to be arrogant. What if they catch on? Pull your top down like the others. Wait... But... How dare you! I saved your life and this is how you repay me? Just perfect. That idiot, good for nothing! Pray, Lady Perfect serves the country well and becomes the prime minister! Or maybe the king's wife, huh? It's definitely a multiple-launching rocket. How big? About 100 arrows a round. What! Joseon can make a rocket that big? Look at the blueprints, sir. The length of the arrows and amount of gunpowder must be to scale to work. I've done the calculations hundreds of times but can't get it right. Something like this can only be sketched after years of research and trials. That means they tested every measure from 2ft 1 mm to 17ft 1 mm. Absolutely astonishing. Now, this is saltpeter. This explodes? Not like this, fool. A spoon of charcoal. A spoon of charcoal. A spoon and a half of sulfur. A spoon and a half of sulfur. Seven and a half spoons of saltpeter. Seven and a half spoons of saltpeter. Now, hold up your feathers. And stir it carefully. If you don't, it can explode due to friction. So lightly stir with the feather like this. Carefully. Lightly. Like you're rubbing a woman's nipples. Carefully. How was that? Great! It should serve well up to the standard Singijeon. But to make the Grand Singijeon, we need twice the explosive power. This is the Grand Singijeon's gunpowder. It has to be this explosive. That's easy. Just mix up twice the amount of gunpowder. Rocket arrows do not come on easy calculations like that. This is a model of the Grand Singijeon. It takes more than just gunpowder. It also needs crude iron. Iron? You mean like metal scraps? This is the small and standard Singijeon. This is the gunpowder flask and this is the ignition. This black part makes the arrows fly out. The ignition flies out and explodes. Chief Moo-seng. Please make room as I'll explain how the gunpowder flask is made. Why's it cone shaped? It's harder to ram in the powder. It's to get the most propulsive force. Remember to ram the powder in tightly, leaving no air inside here. If there is air left, it can explode before it even flies out. This is an iron rod. And this mold is iron, too. Friction can blow off a hand or even get someone killed! Yes, it's dangerous. But what can we do? Developing rockets is not a business for making profits. Now you're trying to make more offerings than me? All I gave the monks is some dirt! Why do you care! Why are those monks collecting dirt under the eaves, anyway? Have you had lunch? Not yet. - Waitress. - Yes, sir. What is inside your sac? - Open it up. - Yes, sir. It's saltpeter! - Tie him up! - Yes, sir. What are you doing? He is dead, sir. I have sinned greatly. We are leaving, now. What will he do when they come after him? Sir? In-ha! Where is Hong-li? Maybe here, maybe there. Here it is! Where is Hong-li? All gone. Are you not afraid to die! There is no coming and going in this world. Wash your karma with this. Treacherous monk! You could get hurt. You'll get hurt swinging around angrily like that. Can you walk at lightning speed? Can you conjure wind with your hands? Can you beat 10 master warriors in a fight? That's hard. But no match for your Singijeon. Some master. A master merchant. A master fighter. A master at chasing women. You disturb me, my lady. If you're disturbed because of me, then you're not a master warrior. A master warrior should not be shaken by anything. I guess there is no woman steadfast like you. You will not be shaken, no matter what happens. Of course not, nobody easily can. Though it's very difficult... Though I am afraid, I must pretend I'm not. Though I am lonely, I must pretend I'm not. Though I am scared, I must pretend I'm not. That's very difficult to do. My father told me to be humble. He said if I can't, I would not be loved by anyone. But I've become a woman who cannot even properly thank you. What warrior in Joseon can beat Tayi-lyang? I've searched among the strongest warriors. He must be unknown to the court subjects. General. 50,000 soldiers led by Tae-lang and our army of 50,000 are assembled together. I know. Then you must know what will happen if we can't finish this ourselves! Her Majesty HWANG, Her Majesty HYUN... We have to pay tributes even to Her Majesty HYUN's eunuchs? Her Majesty HYUN, the Emperor's third wife is receiving much favor. So what her eunuchs say is changing history. I gave you an important piece of information. Forget it, then! Next! Offer up 2,000 maidens and 1,000 eunuchs to the Emperor. There are no young maidens in Joseon. We have a custom where girls get married when they reach 13. We can't send married women as tributes. The demand for eunuchs is also unreasonable. If we castrate boys, 1 out of 2 end up dying. Thus asking for 1,000 eunuchs is like demanding 1,000 more deaths. That is right. It is not proper to kill our people like this! Not proper? Joseon's citizens also belong to our Emperor. Fine then. 800 eunuchs it is. And prince? Let's change the marriage custom. Make a new law that forbids girls from marriage before age 16. But Chamberlain! I'm exhausted. That'll be all for today. The first machine is ready. Fire it, sir. What happened? Fire the second one. Why can't I get it right? The latticework, peep sight, the ratio... We must check all of it again. Yes, of course. If only we had the Singijeon Manual... The manual? You suggest we go get it, now? What I meant was... Who should go? Me? Or will you, sir? No, it's just that... Or send them? Why can't you believe that we can do this ourselves? I'm sorry. I apologize. The Singijeon Manual... Yes, we need it. But the people... The precious one... I'm exhausted after staying up a few nights. Let's get some rest tonight, chief. To protect the precious one. Pardon? You just said, "The precious one. " No! I said, "The precious ones. " I'll go over the blueprints. Oh, the precious one! Damn it. This is harder than fighting. Shit. Watch it! Are you insane? You can't come in here! Get out, now! No! I'm staying with you! I told you to be careful, Bong-gu. Here's the book you asked for. Hasekawa will be pleased. When will the Singijeon be completed? What's the rush, sir? Things don't look good. Perhaps the fate of our nation is in your hands. I'll tell the chief to hurry it up. Be careful. The royal army chief at a tavern like this? I guess my secret is out. I come here time to time to take a break from the palace. Care to join me for a drink? My pleasure. - Wrong room. I apologize. - No need, sir. - Appreciator of drinks, I see. - It's to live long, sir. To live long? One day drunk is like a year sober. Would it be improper to ask to have a drink together at our first meeting? Sharing drinks in a tavern is hardly improper, sir. Have a seat. - Care for another? - No thank you. Some men drink and only know its pleasures. And do not know how to moderate themselves. While others know and restrain too much and do not know the joy. Thank you. I should pay for my drink. Here. Wow! Gold coins used only in the Ming Royal Palace. Thank our generous guest. Thank you sir. Hi, Yoo-bong. I got it. But what are you going to use it for? Well done. Let's step back. How did you do it? Meloid powder. Meloid? Made from grinding beetles. It's poisonous but it keeps the gunpowder from lumping together. It was my father's secret recipe. That's amazing! Are you that excited? Of course I am! Then how about a pat on the head. I think we've figured it out. We've increased the amount of gunpowder and pressure. And the explosive power is far greater now. It should work! Ocho! Ocho! Go and look after Ocho! Help me, please! I don't want to die. My baby... I want to at least see his face. You won't die! Stop talking nonsense! I'm dying! No! Ocho! Wake up! Is he really dead? No, he fainted. Damn it! How long will you keep this up? Do you even know what you're doing? There are many variables in developing weapons. What? Variables? How many more must die to stop these variables? If you don't have the skills, shouldn't you give up! Bloody Singijeon! Shut up! You're a mere peddler! You don't know anything! Why you! The thing shoots like a baby urinating! Some divine weapon! That's the Singijeon? Damn it! I never saw anything go right with a woman in charge! Never! Shit. What's the problem? Tell me the truth. Tell us what's wrong. Tell us, please? If we had the Singijeon Manual, our problems will be solved. You mean the book that was stolen? Yes. But isn't that kept in the Ming delegates' residence? Damn it. This is a cross section of the Grand Singijeon. The barrel's caliber is 2 inches and 2mm and the length 2ft. With something this big... the arrows can easily fly over 2,000 yards. 2,000 yards? The arrows can fly over even a wide river! Is this possible? No, sir. But if it was possible... It would be a catastrophe. But it's impossible. It's just a theory. It's absolutely impossible. Live together, die together. Where are you going without your arms and legs? You don't even know the layout of the Ming residence. Why did you tell him that! How could you let them walk right into their end! Alert the general! Open the door, Bong-gu! Bang-ok! Open it! Open it, Bong-gu! No man or animal can survive that long. Wrap it up! Let's go, chief. I'll be the decoy. Chief! Don't die. You can't die. Pretty good for a merchant. What are you doing? That's a report to the Emperor! You can't give up like this! It's out of our hands, now. We can only leave it up to the Emperor's will, now. We still have a chance! Trust me and wait! General! Any further delay could mean disaster! - But the Singijeon's power is... - Shut up! Look, general! Don't forget I am the one in charge! But it's my job to catch the culprits! Detonator's position? 5 inches at front. And the back? 5ft 1 inch. 5 degrees 3mm. We had it right. 5.3 grams. That's right, too. It's the injection hole. The injection hole? The gunpowder barrel and capacity are different no matter how precisely made. In order to have the right thrust, the diameter must be 9.7 cm, and the injection hole must be 1.2 cm. Thus, square 1.2 cm to the diameter 1000. Then you'll get the exact size of the injection hole. An exact calculation for even a small hole like this? Truly amazing. Here's the book you asked for. Thank you very much. Akiko wanted to see this book so much. She died without being able to see this. Goodnight, sir. Hope to see you again. Thank you. Let's go. Who is Akiko? Scatter out! Nobody move! You fool! You may be brave, but you know you're no match for me! Swords were made to protect people. You're a disgrace to warriors! Beat savages with savages. Let Tayi-lyang's army be on the forefront! First, release 3,000 slaves from Yeo-jin! Second! Joseon has been provoking war by leaving garrisons at the borders! Remove all your troops south of the Liaodong border at once! Look Chamberlain! That land has long belonged to us! An army of 100,000 men is headed this way as we speak! Leave us, everyone! The Emperor is firmly against Joseon developing new weapons! There is not much time. Stop at once and offer up Hong-li and the Singijeon Manual to the Emperor! It's the only way to stop the war! Do you understand? If there is a war, Ming will suffer losses, too. That is all up to Joseon. We must protect the nation, Your Majesty! We cannot start a war against Ming! Please stop the weapon developments and give them what they want. We cannot back down now, Your Majesty! Away with you all! Please stop this, Your Majesty! Enough! Leave us! How close is the enemy? They are approaching fast, Your Majesty. Establishing Joseon's independence is such a long and difficult mission. Take that back. We're almost there! Please! Here's the money I promised. You're leaving after taking just one peak? They say to look at the bamboo in the moonlight. And a woman through the blinds. I can smell the wine from here. You'll make me drunk. Wow! You finally perfected it? We finally did it. We'll test the Grand Singijeon in the morning. Then it'll all be over. What did Chief Chang-kang say? To hold hands tightly and stay strong. Because Joseon's fate... lies in our hands. That hurts. What are you doing! It's the King's orders. This! That! It can't be what our King has chosen! What cursed situation is this! Stop! You dare go against His Majesty's commands! Not even the King could stop me now! Stay back! How dare a fool like you go against the King's orders! I'll cut you to shreds! Stop! Please! Stop! I shall go! What? I shall go! No! But I must! I won't let you go! It is me they want. I must go to end this! I can't let you go! You'll go for the court who used you? No! For our people! Then what about me? What am I to you? Trifling emotions. Foolish thought. Foolish? Are you not scared? No. - Are you not lonely? - No. Are you not afraid? No! Why! Because of you... Because... I have you! You know very well. I must go to save you. And to save your people. I know. But... I promise to give my life to save you. How did it go? I've been foolish. I heard you've been promoted to a delegate. Congratulations, sir. How can a court subject be associated to the enemy! Can't you see what is really best for our nation? I only did what I must to save our country! You've put our nation in danger and made us a tributary state! You ignorant fool! Thank you for coming all this way, General. We've come to thank you sir for helping our tribe. Right this way. Allow us to bow. No need. We will escort you safely to Yun-kyung. Hold up your flags and swords! Stop! Who goes there! It's an attack! Battle positions! Who are they? Come get me! Yen, go to the prisoner cart! Follow me, men! There's too many of them. Let's retreat for now. Bong-gu! Retreat! Retreat! Go. Hurry! Let's go. Chase them down till the end! Mount, now! There's only a hundred or so! How can I be attacked by them! Damn, my ear. Listen men, prepare to attack! Don't be so rash! I have over 3,000 men, alone! What are you afraid of? They've set up camp by the water! If we fight now in the dark, we'll lose half our men! Looks like they'll wait till dawn. Bang-ok? Yes, sir. Be brave and fight well, brothers! Charge! - Ready, men! - Yes, sir! Let's go! Crazy fools. The bastards! Attack! Hold up the spears! Now! Charge! Charge! Attack! Attack from behind! Attack from behind! Defend the rear! Maintain formation! 5 steps back! 5 steps back! 5 steps back! Like rats trapped in a cage. Now, Sul-ju! Yes, sir! The flag is up! Light up the weapons! Take cover! Take cover! Fire the weapons! Shields! Load up the weapons! Attack! Hurry it up! We don't have much time! Hurry! Still not ready? Almost done! Left wind! Turn a little to the left! Take cover! No! Let's retreat for now! - Retreat! - Retreat! Do not retreat! Attack! Foolish bastards! - Yen? - Yes, sir. - Take attack formation! - Yes, sir. Chief? You've got nine lives. - Charge! - Charge! Weapons up front! That's right! Shields! Prepare the Standard Singijeon! Fire the weapons! One. Two. Three. Yen! Fire the fifth one! The Yeo-jin tribe remnants are gathered there! - Prepare the Grand Singijeon! - Yes, sir! What ghastly weapon is that, sir! Are all our Ming soldiers... dead? Yes, they're gone. - Kill her at once! - Yes, sir. Get out! Stop! I said stop! What are you doing? I said kill the bitch, now! She must be brought to the Emperor! Why aren't you firing? But it's never been fired before. What are you doing? Did you see that, sir? Get down if you want to live! Next is the list of Joseon's queens to offer gifts to. Queen SHIM, Queen KANG, Queen KIM, Queen YANG, Queen LEE, Queen SONG... So many wives... Send back the eunuchs and maidens. Will that do? The recent incident that occurred in the borders... is the result of cunning officials. I send an envoy to resolve any misunderstandings. Pray that Joseon's King will master his fury... And continue to maintain our solid fellowship. Are you Hong-li? Yes, Your Majesty. And you are Sul-ju? Yes, Your Majesty. I have a request for you two. Please be in charge of our armory. I decline, Your Majesty. You have saved the nation and brought peace. You are the ones who will help Joseon flourish. But we... We are happy as is, Your Majesty. What are you doing, Your Majesty? - Please, stop! - Your Majesty! I have bowed to an enemy's subject. I can also bow to great citizens of this land. I am the King. But you are Emperors. Why don't we just get married? What do you think? How shameless! What? How can you propose to me in the middle of a market street? Huh? They're called fireworks. Chief JIN! Start your bidding, please. That's fairly common in Ming, too. 10 silver coins. Bastards. Might as well take it for nothing. He's a bad man, isn't he? 30 silver coins. 40 coins. 50. Rotten thieves! Show them, Pan-su. Take a look outside. 60 gold coins! 100 gold coins! 150 gold coins! That's not for sale. It's not? 150 gold coins will buy us 300 sacks of rice! Why not? Are you mad? That's to propose to you with. How can I ever sell that? The small and Standard Singijeon, completed in 1430 during King Sejong's reign, was the world's first multiple-launching rockets. The Grand Singijeon was the world's first missile with a shooting range of 3km. Western Europe produced a similar weapon in 1779... over 300 years later.
