Yes, sir. Oxygen. - Yes, sir. I'll get it. Put him on the table. Put on the mask. Give me the cotton. Clean the wound fast. There's a huge loss of blood! Right now, we are standing at Lloyd Memorial Hospital. ...where the loved singer of millions Rohan Arya has been admitted. Rohan Arya met with an accident few minutes earlier. His condition is said to be very critical at the moment. Doctors aren't sure whether they could save Rohan Arya or not. Rohan! Rohan! Rohan! Rohan! " Since you met me darling, i've come to know what life is. " " I've learnt how to live." " I am obliged." " Thank you!" " Thank you!" " My aim is to get you." " My religion is to love you now."

You are telling us to leave from here. Sorry, Sir. I'll arrange right now. Listen, if you take more that 2 minutes... ... then your boss will come to put the table for us. Mr. Qureshi. How come our names are not here? Mr. Qureshi, it seems you have come to the wrong address. Here, a showbiz party is going on. I think Annual Journalist program is going on somewhere else. How are you, Sharad? Leave us. You tell about yourself. How is your journalism going on? Has it expired or still alive? It's your misconception, Sharaad. In fact, we have not kept journalism alive but journalism has kept us alive!! And may be you too. The only difference is that in spite of knowing the power of press. You are not able to shoulder it's responsibility. Sir, when we will understand this... We will surely come in your shelter! Sir, your table is ready. Okay, Mr. Qureshi. We will continue this discussion some other day. Sure! Qureshi sir, it's so good to see you. How are you, Shikha? Many congratulations!! Thank you so much to coming sir. In fact, I should thank you. You call me to such places... Where we have to try to write the things that are in demand Or else you very well know that in our newspaper Page 3, 4, 5... are altogether similar. But, now you have to write about our Rohan. Come, I'll introduce you with Rohan. Give five raise. Cheers! Rohan, meet Mr. Shakeel Ahmed Qureshi. Editor of Hindi Dally Awaaz. - Hello sir, Rohan Arya. It was because of the stardom. I'll be back in a moment. Mr. Qureshi, how are you? Fine! Rohan son, meet Mr. D.K. Shroff. A.C.P. Crime Branch. He is an amazing human being! Myself, Rohan Arya. Many Congratulations!! Thank you. There's style in this superstar! Hey, Gary. Just recently he got stardom... Everybody likes to enjoy stardom initially. Wow! I got a very good story!! Do you know that Rekha... She was telling that yesterday somebody took her smooch in Ahuja's party. It's of no use. Look there... Fresh food is being cooked there. Really? Of a superstar!! Shikha, you gave me so much training during the contest. How to present oneself at the party... How one should walk... When he should sit and when to stand... What one should speak... And when one should keep his mouth shut. But, one thing you didn't teach me. When one feels solitude in such crowd... What should he do? Congrats! Sharad Rajput. Journalist. You sing very well. So, how do you feel? Stardom! Affection of fans? Attention from the press?? It's clear, I'm liking it. So, do you intend to continue this? Sorry, I didn't understand it. Look, Rohan... I speak very straightly. Even, I've come here leaving my house. I'm one from your well wisher. The thing is that a Circus looks good till the events keep on changing... Public get bored if there's no change. You didn't understand? Let me explaln... Now that you've become a star! The drama is over!! Now, we have to do a new drama. If you wish, we can do this drama for you. Like the love story of you and Shikha... Look, there's nothing like it. So, when did we say it is so... We are telling that we feel so... And our shop runs on the basis of this only. And what we print...the whole nation prints the same. Not interested. Hey, you seem to get angry... Okay, let's have a small personal interview. Come on. So, you want my personal interview? The office of Showbiz opens at 10 in the morning. Take an appointment from the P.R. department... and then call me for confirmation. If I get time, interview will take place. Ladies and gentlemen may i have your attention please. It is my pleasure to introduce the star of the evening Rohan Arya... Friends, Rohan has achieved that which... no singer in the industry hasn't achieved yet. We will hear it all from Rohan. But, before that let me introduce our business partners... ... Mr. Madam Madhwani... ... and Mr. Ajit Madhwani. Please come. Our international business partners... ... Mr. Arun Parikh and Mr. T. Scott. And last but not the least Showbiz channel's... Showbiz channel's creative head... Ms. Shikha Verma. Give a hand once more for Rohan Arya. Ms. Shikha come this side. Please... Sir, please say her. Yeah! Come here. " Om Ganeshay Namah." This is protection and this is also protection. You have to do everything in business. I like it. I liked this article. A good journalist writes that what is in demand... ... and this is in demand but writing this in paper Waste. I called you here because... I want to put forth an offer before you to work with me. We can still sell this boy a lot if you can sell him. Sir i can sell his whole family but... ... i loved freedom and so i love working for myself. You must be a Virgo... you will be working for yourself. Virgos are very artistic and stubborn. I don't want you to work with me but want you to sell you work... ... exclusively to NNN channel. See it is a simple thing 100 crore's company can't keep telecasting... ... about famine and earthquake struck people. People prefer gossip than the truth of their own lives. A film star's wedding or a film star's love story is more valuable... ... than the riots in the area or unemployment in this country. I don't say this the TRPs say. Business and media has a simple rule. Show the viewer what he wants to see. And that's why the more the juicy... ... and sizzling story the more is the money you get... understood. Every fool can understand the language of money. And then whatever i want is with you. So what you want i will get for you in some or the other way. Now every breathe of Rohan Arya will be breaking news... What nonsense is this? These journalists writes whatever they want? We are not just friends, how can they write something like this? Rubbish! All lies! You should catch hold of these journalist... ... and bash them up. They print anything. What do you think? We look good together. Hi. So, you liked the picture? You must have liked this. After all you must have said all this. Take it easy Shikha. I didn't say anything to anybody. I have not given the statement okay. Do you think i am blind? That journalist was flattering you... ... and you flew in the air. Listen Mr. I am in this profeddion from... ... last three years know very well that how does this media operates. You must have said 2 things and he added more spice to it and published the same. Shikha, you are not even ready to hear me. I don't know what you are going on imagining? And by the way, what's the point in getting angry on such articles? The matter isn't of the picture but your cheap game! What was the necessity for this filthy publicity? Don't you know i have to answer to my management. Okay! You've already decided that I'm the culprit. Fine! Go on... I'll not say anything. Fine. Rachel, please take him to the recording. Rohan... I want to clear one thing with you. From today onwards, you consider me as your manager only and not your friend! " If you are angry with me. Beloved, i don't complain." " If you don't accept, shall i think you don't love me?" " I can stay without you, but i don't have the courage." " If you are angry with me. Beloved, i don't complain." " If you don't accept, shall i think you don't love me?" " I can stay without you, but don't have the courage." " You are the star of my sky." " You are the shore of the rigorous tides." " Smile and support me. " Listen to me." " You are the star of my sky." " You are the shore of the rigorous tides." " Smile and support me." " Listen to me." Hey, what is wrong with you? Listen to me. If you don't do it now, you can never do it in your life. " I was just a voice." " Beloved, you gave me a recognition." "I was unknown to myself." " You made me realize who i am." " You've done a favor to me. You've showed me a way." " You are my destination." " You are the star of my sky." " You are the shore of the rigorous tides." " Smile and support me." " Listen to me." " You are in my dreams and my thoughts." " You are in my songs..." " If you are mine, it will be like the spring season." " ... in the deserted place." " Whoever the partner is." " My destination lies where you are." " You are the star of my sky." " You are the shore of the rigorous tides." " Smile and support me." " Listen to me." Yes, i know. There is a lot going on for him right now. So, i just hope everything is taken care of. Yes, there shouldn't be anything to worry about. I'll be there. Rachel will be there. Shikha. - I am sure we can take care of this. Yes sure. - Shikha. Just want to ask you about tomorow. What's it? - Not much, just a couple of meetings. - Okay. Can we. Like meet tomorow? Please. - Is that guy with you? One second. Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing?? Why are you touching the camera? What's your problem? Did I stop you from singing? Or did I stop you from making merriment with your girl friend? Since, we are not putting hurdle in your work... then, why are you doing it to us? Look, you are a star! And our job is to click pictures of star!! Go and carry on... Give me the camera. I am warning you. You are indeed very smart!! You could share the bed with the girl to win the contest. And you aren't ready to click a photo either... with her after getting your work done? Hey, what did you say? Hey scoundrel! Hey stop! - I'll not spare you, scol! - Stop it. You raised your hand on the media. Rohan. Stop it. - Let's go. You are fighting in the premises... Hey, we are media person. Come on get away! Well done, sir. Come here... come here... What were you doing Rohan? What were you doing? Why were you fighting like the mobs? What was the need to create a scene? Tell me damn it... i am talking to you, Rohan. Why did you do it? Because i love you. What? I love you Shikha and if anyone... ... comments over you i can't stand it. I will beat him not once but hundred times. If anyone passes dirty comments over you i will kill him. I'll kill him. What is the reason for this anger Shikha? What did Rohan do? Did he abuse you? Beat you? What did he do? He just told the truth... that he loves you... ... and you got angry. You know what your problem is? You can't stand love. You have problem with this word as if it is a disease. It is a disease. A disease which cannot be cured. First trust these people get close with them. Share always your thoughts, etc with them... ... and then they leave you. Because in the lives of these celebrities everything is fair. They can't be honest with one girl. Today me then someone else and then someone else. It never ends. Coward... you are coward Shikha... You are amongst the people who in... ... the fright of death stop enjoying their lives. Where there is love, there is pain. How long, how long can you stay away from love Shikha? Please leave me alone. Fantastic! This is fantastic! "When a star's photograph was clicked with... his girl friend, he beat the innocent journalist" This is an attack on the freedom of media... Media was attacked brutally. This is fantastic! Fantastic! You'll deserve to be a journalist. Welcome to the business of media... ... and welcome to the world of story telling. This is just the beginning. There is lot more to come. When you will see this simple story in the breaking news segment of our channel. Then, you'll come to know that the audience likes to see such things only. You are great! He is right!! But, what shall we do next? It's simple. This boy Rohan Arya will become a big star after this breaking news! Those people who don't know about him... will be eager to know. And will be restless waiting to know more about it. They will eagerly wait for his next story. Public loves these stars very much! They worship them but, are even jealous of them too. When this stars fall to the ground, public enjoys the most! To make stars and to make them fall. There's no other paying business for media other than this. Guys! Follow Rohan Arya. If you don't have story then make one. I need that material which could make the audience switch to our channel. Story! Rumor! Fake story!! Private moments!! Anything that means TRPs. Ranjeet, it's your responsibility. Whatever news we will setup on Uncle's channel. We should have complete details with us. Can't say when could we require what? He is a strange man! He was with his girl friend. I move forward to take the picture. Now, he is a star and our job is to take picture. You tell me, where did I go wrong? If someone would raise hand on poor journalist like me then... If the freedom of press is muffled this way then... It's up to the government to decide upon it. It is the press people, who should behave a little responsible... ... and sensibly or else they will get beating... ... and kicks from the celebrities. Who is Rohan? I don't know any Rohan?? No, I don't know? I think Rohan and Shikha look damn good together. He beat that reporter. He did very right. If it was my boy friend in his place then, he would have run away! See Rohan, it isn't such that I don't want to do anything. The fact is that I couldn't do anything! You are seeing this for the first time. Isn't it? But, I've seen such thing many times. This is what we call show business! Look Rohan, their job is not to make moral judgment. Their job is just to sell the product. Now, either the product sells from your songs... or from the program which is going against. Frankly they don't care. If it is so, then I couldn't associate myself with such company. ...which couldn't differentiate between truth and lies. Then, you could not work in any company. Because every company does the same thing. Look Rohan, you don't worry of these things. You concentrate on music. Rest you leave on me. Till I'm here, no one could harm you. Just trust me boy bye... Such time will not come. So much lies... So much cackling... I'll go forever leaving all this! Look son, why don't you understand... I don't belong here sir... I don't. Okay, then book his tickets. If he wishes to go back home then, Let him go! As it is there's no one to stop him. Who was it? Nobody... it was Rajan's phone. He was telling that Rohan wants to go home. It's sales paper, do sign it. If he wishes to go, let him go! As it is he wasn't happy surrounded by scandals. I think he is taken the right decision. What do you think? Sign. Thanks. Bye. Where are you going, Rohan? Home! Why? I don't have any reason to wait either. And if you get a reason then? Come with me. Shikha where you taking me Shikha, please. Madam, what do you have to tell us about your relationship? Tell us, ma'am. For the past few days, you'll were worried whether... there's something going between both of us or not. Today, I want to finish all these rumors. By saying that I fall in completely in love with him! Ma'am, tell us more about it. - Thank you ma'am. " I wish a day comes..." " ... when the time stops." " Only you in front of me..." "... and the life passes by." " I wish a day comes..." " ... when the time stops." " Love should go beyond the limits..." " The moments that i passed by seeing you and thinking about you." " I had locked you in the corner of my heart." " Now when i've met you..." "... my world is full of happiness." " Beloved, don't betray me after falling in love with me." " Don't get angry with me on anything." " It shouldn't happen that you break my heart." " ... and shatter it into pieces." Please, sir. One more. Please, sir. One autograph. Taara, I have the booty! You pick pocketed? Yes. Show me whose it is? Show me. It's Rohan's... In the crowd... ...i removed it i thought he saw me... ... but still he didn't say anything. Bly idiot give it to me. Leave it. Look it has so much that... ... we can spend our ten fifteen dais in leisure. Look here. Oh, handsome. Look, how much money is there. 1,2... You bitch! If you do it again. I'll kill you! Get lost, you wretched woman. Pray good fortune for the owner of this money! I haven't thought that this album will get such an overwhelming response. Thank you Showbiz. And i know that... Behl sir is thinking that when will... ... i stop talking and he gets a change to talk. Please come, Mr. Behl. Thank you, my boy. Today, I have much more to say. Therefore, you have to listen to my chatter for sometime. Friends, today is a very big day for us. Because Rohan's album has become number #1 in music chart! Not only this... ... but the other good news is... ... the showbiz entertainment is now going international. Germany's company Granada has decided that they... will sponsor the 1st international trip of Rohan Arya. It's indeed a pleasure that Rohan being a winner of a... talent contest is going to become a music icon today! And our creative head Ms. Shikha Verma is going to Delhi to finalize this tour. All these jokers like Mr. Behl have the same tendency... To become the owner of channel! Excuse me, sir. - What is it come back later. - Ok. As if the ownership of channel is distributed free gift! He is willing to make his own news channel for the last 3 years! 3 years!! Bly Showbiz my foot. What are you people doing. Hey idiots come here. - Let's go. - What are you doing? You stepped out to make Rohan Arya's love story. What happened? Rohan Arya's album was a hit. Even his love story is a hit. Behl's TRP is in demand now. I don't like this smile on Behl's face. Come on do something. Sir we are following him but if a person is having... ... no affair how can we destroy him. What do we do? Idiot. Understand the camera's power. Use, reuse, misuse, abuse but bring me breaking news. However the person is he's got to have a story. Follow him twenty four hours. Now get out, out! "Don't get angry..." My friend Garry... ... calls him a superstar. See, he looks really handsome. I and my friend Tara had seen his show oh he dances so well. Hey don't lie. Don't believe me. Terra likes him a lot. Really? Then what. Wherever he goes she will also go there. Only to see him. She is crazy. When i ask her to go and talk to him she gets scared. There is past story between them. I don't know what. Forget about that, do something. You can bring them together. Why what will you do? You will get money. Oh... how much? Ten thousand. Ten thousand. I hope you won't put us in any problem. There is no problem... you just... ... have to make a call you will get ten thousand rupees will you do it? How much time will it take to reach the airport. Half an hour. What's the time. It's ten. Oh, i am going to be late. I am going to miss my flight. Hello! - Hi Rohan! Who? - Sheena. Sheena. Sheena, Tara's friend. Okay tell me one thing do you want to meet Tara? Where? Coloba... in Chhote Nawab's hotel. She will meet you there. Hello, yes Mr. Behl. Okay. Yes. Okay, Mr. Behl. I am coming. What happened? Sir's phone he called me urgently. Why? He's got some important work. So you are not coming to the airport. Don't worry , i will go. " I am still young. I am full of juvenile..." " I am still young. I am full of juvenile..." " I am still young." Excuse me. Where can i meet Tara? You'll find her there. You don't take tension, dear. Rohan! Rohan, please go away from here. Rohan, please go away from here. - Please, listen to me Tara. I don't want to listen anything. Listen to me. No! - Why are you behaving like this? Just listen to me. Tara what is wrong with you, please listen to me. Please, listen to me. Please, you come with me. I'm there with you. Let's go. Do you have a matchstick? Who are these people? Hey baby. - Rohan, who are they? I know these people. We will telecast this on the prime time. Stop the car, Rohan! Hurry up, Rohan. Get lost from here! You calm down. No! - Hey baby. Come. Come. Stop the car, Rohan! - Shut up. Tara, please be quiet. Don't get scared. I said, stop the car, Rohan. I will not let anything happen to you. You leave me and go, Rohan. Rohan, stop the car! You be quiet! Don't concentrate to what he says, Tara. Rohan, just stop the car! Hey, they went. Hurry up. Follow them. - Yes, sir. Isn't it a good shot? Brother, what next? I think he is finished. It's very bad to drive the car after drinking liquor. Make him bath in it. Sure, boss my pleasure. What super star? Will you drink it? Why are you showing fingers at me? Hey superstar. Have a drink... Drink superstar. Have a drink. Have a drink. Go and lower the zip of that girl. Come on, go... Brother, she is still alive! She could be saved if we call an ambulance. Hey,just listen and understand. We are not social workers but journalists! And right now we will gain from her death! We have to cover this incident without doing anything. Is it okay? Come on. Come on. Come on. This call girl was present with Rohan Arya in the car at the time of accident. In this accident a taxi driver and a call girl lost their lives. It is proved that the call girl was with Rohan Arya in his car. Yes, mother... speak up. You don't worry your son will get full justice. Mother look at this camera. Please say... We only want that whatever happened... should not be forgotten easily. I've lost my son! He is our family... Now, whoever is responsible for this should be punished. He will surely be punished! Rohan Arya. Down! Down! Rohan Arya. - Down! Down! Rohan was seen with a call girl. What relation does he have with her? There was a call girl in Rohan's car. What is the relation between them? Who is that girl? What is her name? Why aren't you answering our questions? Enough! Get everybody put from here. All! Out! You think you can do anything you like? Come on, move. You can't force yourself here. Careful... careful... how are you feeling Mr. Rohan. All of your reports are normal. You'll be discharged very soon. And I feel that you could do a show within a week. What happen to that girl who was with me? Yeah, that girl is in comma. Nothing could be said right now. But, we are trying. How did this happen? - Who was the girl with you? Kamble, get these reporters back. Tell all of them to move back. Our channel showed you the grievance of the mother of that taxi driver. What is your comment on it. We want to know it from you. That where do you post Rohan Arya? You could send your suggestion through SMS. If you feel Rohan Arya is innocent then you pick up... ...the phone and type ROHY and send it to us on 3131 Look Rohan, you yourself are increasing your trouble. According to the blood report it s known that you weren't drunk that night. Even this news was broke by NNN News. Just like your previous stories, your accident's... footage reached them first. Even before the police reached there. Was someone following you before the accident? Or did you see anybody after the accident? Or this accident took place because of somebody else? Tell me, Rohan. There's nothing you could achieve by remaining silent. Who was that girl? What's the relation between you and her? Look Rohan, if you are hiding it because of any fear then... Sir. Your ball is done. Rohan, do you know what really your problem is? You are unable to make sure who is with you and who is against you. Now, this doesn't make any difference. Srivastav. Yes, Sir. Keep an eye on him. Yes, Sir. You don't bother, Rohan. I'll muffle this case anyway. As it is the memory of people is very weak! They'll remember today but will forget tomorrow. Even you forget it! And the business loss I've incurred... I'll forget it as well. Shikha had called up. She is hurt for sure! Look son, everybody commits mistake. But, one who doesn't learn from mistakes is a fool! Hello! Rohan I'm talking with you just to make sure that you don't call me henceforth. I'm not used to defamation like you. It would be better if you live your life accordingly. And leave on my condition. " The people of the world broke my heart." " They left me all alone." " Beloved, i don't want to live." " ... without you..." " The people of the world broke my heart." Whether anybody benefits out of Rohan Arya's controversy... ... but the national network is making a lot of profit. This week this channel has made a lot of profit... ... and it has reached the number one position. " All my dreams shattered. They are causing me pain." " My songs are on fire..." " ...and the lamps of memories are extinguishing..." " The whole world was with me." " Now there is solitude all around." " Everyone used to sing my songs..." "...now there is betrayal..." " People of the world." The procession of the taxi drivers in the protest of... ... Rohan Arya has become vigorous. A wounded taxi driver succumbed to death today in the hospital. " Come close to me and listen to my heartbeat. Beloved, i crave for you." " If you are with me, i'll face all the tantrums of the world." " There is no life without you." " It is like the passing smoke." " There is no story without you." " It is like an erased mark." " The people of the world broke my heart." Rohan! Sir, Shrivastav here. No problem at all, sir. Very good, sir. Good luck, sir. Wonderful. - First class. - Don't i look good in it? Come on, hurry up. - Yes, sir. Sir. Sir! Hey wait! Hey wait! I am sorry. Rohan, forgive me. Sorry Rohan. Rohan, sorry. Sorry. Hey, have you gone mad? Hey, forgive me. Come out. - Rohan. No! How are you Rohan? I'll come in the evening! Are you waiting for someone? I was looking at the architecture of the building? Why? Any problem? No problem. I was just asking. See here, sir. I am jobless now but you are a ACP. Why are you wasting your time after me. Whether my time is wasted or not Rohan... ... but i don't want you to spoil your life. Thank you sir... Thank you for your concern. I want to talk something to you. About Rohan. I don't need any clarification from you or from him, excuse me sir. One minute Shikhaji. There is something... ... about which you should be knowing... ... please Clarification is given by people who do mistakes. He didn't give any clarification to anyone ever. But without knowing the truth, you thought him to be guilty. Look, i understand what you are going through now. Rohan's name being attached to some girl... ... suddenly the accident... i don't think it is the whole truth. What do you mean? Means that Rohan knew that girl Tara for quiet some time. 3 years back he had lodged a complain about her missing. Who is that girl? We are trying to find out about her. Did he ever speak to you about Tara? I doubt that behind this accident... ... those reporters are involved, who have been publishing news... ... about Rohan all the time. I doubt that Rohan wants to fight with them alone. For a girl? Shikhaji, i don't think i have any right to... ... interfere in your personal matter but... ... i think he wanted to tell you about this girl. If you had to give him one change. If possible try to find out Shikhaji... ... because if we don't stop him now we will never be able to stop him. " It is difficult to live here." " Be careful, dear..." " This is Bombay, my dear." Why have you come here Rohan? To riot? Murder? Get out of here Shikha. Why how will you perform without audience Rohan Arya. Super star! Go on Rohan... ... go and kill him. I have not come here to stop you. I just want to see how low you can go. You want to kill that reporter, just because... ... he exposed your filthy work done by you. Because of which, your career, your stardom... ... and everything was snatched from you. How will you hide this reality that? The thing that you are going to do today... ... is for a girl. Hey had someone else said this... The person to whom you are calling a girl... ... do you wish to know who was she? She was my sister. There is some secret in every family... ... which is hidden from this world. I have also kept a secret. I have not said anything to anyone about my sister. I was ashamed to talk about her. She was a drug addict. She used to go mad if she didn't get drugs. And to fulfill these needs she went into profession... Only my mother and i knew this. Dad didn't know this. But the day when dad came to know he pushed her out of the house. That's why since i came to Mumbai i am looking for her... ... and today i found her... ... i don't know will she stay alive. I will kill them... i won't leave any one. I am going to kill each and every one of them. Rohan what is the use of living and dying alone like this. No one is bothered. If you wish to punish such people then there are many ways to do. No there is no other way, will have to kill them... Rohan think... you want revenge or justice. If you want revenge then the story would end here... ... and if you want justice then many lives like Tara... ... and Rohan will be saved. Now this is in your hands, okay. Bine. What happened? Wanted to talk to you sir. I wish to talk to you Rohan. In this war justice would mean that bring those people to law. Make their reality naked. That's why you need to collect all... ... the proofs that will prove them a criminal. I am with you... Darling, open the door. Darling open the door. Why are you angry? Open the door. Whose there? Hey! - Where are the tapes? Why did you come here? - Where are the tapes? Why did you come here? Hey don't move forward... Hey don't move forward... Where are the tapes, Garry? You! Help! Help! First save me? Rohan, save me! Give me your hand. Come on. Give me your hand. Caught you, thank you. Where are the tapes? Which tapes? Where are that tapes, Garry? Tapes... that tapes. Aaram Nagar, bungalow number 14... ... we have an editing room at Ranjit's house. We do all our editing there itself. What ever you want you will get it there itself. Please, save me. - Give me your hand. Rohan, i'll die. - Come on. Thank you Rohan... - Come. - Thank you... ... for saving my life, Rohan. Thank you. You were supposed to kill me.

This Rohan is telling right the... ... hidden cameras are definitely some where here... No its no there... there are no hidden cameras here... Hey you are trying to believe him. Do you think i would've fixed hidden cameras here? Then, listen to me. I, Sharad Baldev Singh Rajput, reporter, accept in all my senses... ... that i've blackmailed people becoming a reporter. Done extortion. Do you think, i'll tell all this? Listen to more. To give breaking news every time... ... as per Mr. Jain's wishes... ... i got Rohan's car accident done and one man was killed in it.

What was that line yes, use reuse... ... misuse abuse but give me breaking news. Never, never what are you saying never i never said this. Jain you spoiled a life of a child for a news... ... you have made him a live dead man. You are murderer. You are accusing me, and you? What are you. Hey i am better than you. Hey Behl sir you... ... when Sharad had given you Jain's tape what did you do. Had you felt some pity on me, you... ... would have given those tapes to the police.

I told you there are no cameras here... Here take this and sign it, we will go home... Hey you don't tell me what to do and what not to do. You first tell me what is this third deal? Hey third deal i had told you about the third deal... ... the one who gives the highest sum for this... ... we will make a deal with him. Hey don't want any money... I want to become a CEO. Sharad you didn't do it right - Behl what i did, i did it right. Jain sir since starting knew that he was the man of this sort... ... but you didn't know that he was of this type. Hey, why will i do this, i am a respectable man. Nobody will escape from here. This is also the face which represents our media. Media does the work... ... of removing the curtain from the dirt of society. But media, who will do the work... ... of removing the curtain from the media's dirt. Who will teach a lesson to the media person. You both will nor get free. I am telling you. Hey what are you talking. You are a cheater... People like these have spoilt the media. Please calm down. Don't fight among yourself. There are no hidden cameras here. It's so strange for the first time in the life... Sharad Rajput is telling the truth and no one is believing him. Sharad has not put any cameras here. Heard? - But... There is definitely a hidden camera here... ... and all your talks are telecast live. Pathan! Scol. I will kill him Stop it, Rohan. I'll kill you. - Leave him. Leave him. Move! I'll kill this scol. I'll kill him. Rohan. Rohan! Stop it! Hey leave will you put handcuffs in the single hand. He will not move forward, don't move... ... enough of the wrestling. - Sharad. Hey don't move else i will kill you. Stop your hand there itself. I am telling you to stop, scol. I am telling you stop, Sharad. I'll kill you. Do you want to know who was the girl in the accident? She was my sister. She was my sister. She was my sister. Rohan, Stop! Rohan, stop! As you see Sharad Rajput... ... Chandrakant Jain and Indraraj Behl are being arrested... These are the people about whom you have seen... ... the live sting operation on the TV. In the same case, police arrested Nakul Whagmare along with Sharad. This is the darker side of the media... ... whose face after seeing this all the media reporters are ashamed... The time has come to see inside ourselves and understand that our. Body has become dirty... come lets talk to Rohan Arya... Today i came to know what ever has happened... ... i am only responsible for that. We get popular from an ordinary personal and... ... try to hide from the media... shiver... First we expose ourselves then we look for cover. I have also done the mistake but i didn't think that... ... i will have to pay a huge price to hide a personal piece. My sister Tara who went underground to... ... save me from bad name. This was our biggest mistake. Had we not hidden the truth then the media would have also not... ... scratched and removed it. Now i wont hide my sister from any one. " Beloved, since i've met you." " I learnt to live life." " Beloved, since i've met you." " I learnt myself." " I learnt to live life." " Thanks for everything." " Thanks."
