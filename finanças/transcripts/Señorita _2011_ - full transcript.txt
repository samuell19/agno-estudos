Hello? Hi. This is Julius. Hi. I'm already here at the place. Okay, I'll see you then. Hi, good evening. I'm Julius. I was the one who called earlier. Hi. Sofia. Have a seat. So, you're Dominic's friend? Yes, ma'am. Your accent is cute. Because I'm from Davao. Davaoe√±o. -So is this a business trip? -Yes, ma'am. I like Davao. There are many good looking guys there. Like you. Anyway, I just wanted to let you know... ...that I have an exclusive client here in Manila, but... ...since you're Dominic's friend... ...I can make an exception. Did Dominic mentioned about the rules? Rules? What rules? If you're just looking for a short time... ...then let's just cancel it. There are girls there in Burgos or in Aurora... ...that will agree on your request in a low price. I am not selling sex. If I'm the one you're looking for... ...you're looking for a fantasy. I am nobody to you therefore I can be anybody. Got it? Do you want to order? I'm good. No thanks. So polite. Such a turn on. Anyway... ...Dominic mentioned about the fantasy you want. You can't change the fantasy once it started. You're not allowed to hit me unless it's part of our agreement. There will be an additional pay for that. And no kissing on the lips. Do we understand each other? So tell me, Julius... ...what turns you on? So... ...how do you like my Korean school girl look? This is what you like, right? Yes, that's what I like. Make yourself comfortable. It's your place anyway. You're naughty, Martin. I like that. I'm Julius. I know but... ...you look like a Martin to me. So cute... ...so shy. Your request is hot but... ...that's additional 3,000, okay? Shall we proceed? Fuck you. You're disgusting. You're gay. What are you? Are you uncircumcised? Don't you have balls? You have a girlfriend and yet you're hiring a gay... ...when nobody's watching. You don't seem like a real man. Hello? Yes. Oh? Nothing, nothing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, it's okay. It's okay, okay. All right, all right. Okay. So shall we start again? -Hi. -Hi, ma'am. This is your order. Thank you. Thanks. How would you tell a girl with low self-esteem... ...to feel better about herself? I will tell her that... ...it's not only physical beauty that's important... ...but also inner beauty. Like the Little Prince said... ..."What is essential is invisible to the naked eye." I will tell her that character and personality matter more... ...than physical beauty. I thank you. You wished for a hotdog, here's your hotdog. What happened to the talent portion? Well, Miss Costa Rica did a gymnastics... ...and then Miss Panama... No, Miss Venezuela... ...she sang "Endless Love". Just like a duet. Half of her face is a man and then a woman in the other side. I already saw that on TV. You performed as Beyonce again? Aren't you tired performing as Beyonce? Why would I get tired of that when I always win? So I did Beyonce again. But I hope you took a picture last night. Not yet. You said that you're sure that there will be pictures today. My friend who is a photographer wasn't there... ...besides, you know that my camera is broken. -Where was the pageant held again? -Marquez Hall. Is that as big as Araneta? Not that big but it's quite big. Is Araneta really big? Yes, that's big but I've never been there. Really? All right then, when I become a PBA player... ...I will invite you to watch my game... ...so you can go there. -Promise? -Of course. All right, finish your breakfast so you won't be late for school. How's Tony? Tony Guillermo? He's our boss now. -Really? -Yes, sir. Tell him to increase your salary. -All right. -Tell him I said it. Okay, yes, sir. By the way, this is Donna. Hi. -How are you? -Carol Quintanar. "Talisay Times." -The newspaper? -Yeah. Yes. She's my finance manager. Okay. All right, sir, are you ready? -Are we going to start now? -Yeah. All right. You've been a physician for 18 years here in Talisay. A doctor like your dad and grandfather... ...you want to be a doctor for the rest of your life. That was then. But now I want to be a mayor. Why, sir? I am so tired of the people... ...complaining about what the government is doing. My father once said... ..."Don't criticize people... ...until you try to experience what they're going through." So I'll try. But perhaps it's not... ...to be a mayor that your father thought when he was lecturing you. Isn't he like a famous... ...like a man who hates politicians? Famous or notorious? They asked father to run for a councilor. They thought... ...to ask him to be their friend... ...to show father how much they will collect... ...and then father will say thanks... ...that the Lord gave him grace. Maybe they thought that father will refuse... ...but they didn't know... They didn't know that father will go to the radio station... ...and newspaper company... ...and rant there. Father said, "You are all crocodiles." That was father said. Is this okay? Yes. It's beautiful. But there are five streamers only. Are those enough? There are four posts that we can put the streamers. In Mrs Ruby's store. She said we can put it there. We can also put it in the corner of Cuervo and Trano. The one near the barbershop. Wave's Barbershop. Really? But they wanted to remove the poster of Tiongson, right? The campaign hasn't started that time but now, it's okay. Just don't occupy the whole wall. Okay. By the way... ...check the budget for tarpaulins with Dixie... ...if we need to add streamers... ...or reduce the other collateral like flyers for example. All right, I think we can find a solution to that. But you need to focus on Dixie. Because that kid is absent-minded. Dixie is just spending her vacation here... ...she doesn't know the rules and regulations here yet. By the way... ...if there's still time... ...let's try to contact the other printing press. I think their price is lower than Celso's in-law. I think we haven't contacted the Barb and Pyramid yet. You're good, huh. Where did you get your management skills? -From the beauty pageants? -I think so. It's Dolfo's kid's baptism this Thursday. He'll serve roasted beef. I won't be able to attend on Thursday. I have a pageant to join to. And I don't want to ruin my figure. It seems like there's always a pageant there in Manila. That's right. The pageant is everywhere there. One week in San Juan and then in Muntinlupa... ...also in Recto and Murphy. Good. Good luck on your pageant. Want a cigarette? No thanks. I've already quit. And I need to finish something. Bye. What made you change your mind? I think there's a huge difference between a politician... ...and a public servant. And mayor... ...is good. A businessman. Cottage industries, economics. I admit... ...I don't know anything about it but what I only know... -...is people is suffering here. -Yes, sir. And bad government is the cause of poverty. If a businessman can't eradicate it, maybe... ...a doctor can. That's right. I will always be with you Even the night is darker It's as bright As the sun Even if everything vanishes Even the heaven and earth, honey Even if everything vanishes The moon and the stars Even if the sun vanishes Helen? Hello? Yes, I can hear you. No, it's okay. What time is it there? Really? You're boss is overworking you? Anyway, Tomas's birthday... ...is next week. Did you send your gift already? No, don't worry. I'll take care of it. All right. Okay. Okay. Take care. Bye. Is that the mother of Tomas? Yes. That's Helen. What is Helen's story? Well, she's working in Dubai. We were childhood friends. She called me last September because she was hired there... ...but no one will take care of Tomas. Also, I'm tired living in the city, so I said... ...okay, I will move there and take care of him. She said she'll return here once she has enough savings. Will she really return here? She will. Is she sending money? If she's not short on money? -Yes. -What about the father? I don't know who and Helen doesn't care anymore. You're the only one Tomas is relying to. I hope not. The kid will be miserable. Don't be like that, Donna. It's not easy bringing up a child. And it's even harder for you because you're both the mother and father. Ramon, would you like to complete this list? Well, Magda, what do you think? Well, madam, you look Glorious Macapagal Arroyo. Hey, Tomas... ...what do you think? This is for the pageant later. I don't like that look on your face. Magda, can you please get the silk fuchsia dress please? Major, major disaster. All right then. I will wear this to the River Queen pageant in Pasig. Tomas, can you leave us for a moment? We're busy here. -Mother Ruby? -Oh? We're here. -Hey, Ramon, are those my materials? -Yes. Donna, this is Mother Ruby. -Come in. -She's our barangay coordinator. Ruby Olager, Donna. She was the one I was telling you about. Mother Ruby is the queen here. Don't listen to that fool. Come, sit here. Otek, bring two Cokes here. -Mother, can I put it here? -Sure. Otek, two soft drinks, two Cokes. -How are you? What's new? -Nothing's new. It's still the same. Tiongson is being complacent. Looking for someone he can fool. Mother Ruby is the combination of Radio Watch and Narcom. If you want the latest news, you can go here in Radio Ruby. I can't do anything about it. They're the one delivering the news to me. It almost put me in danger because of that. Remember when the factory workers complained to me? Those who got fired because of Verano? Ricky Verano? Correct. Oh, you're new here, right? Ricky Verano. Enrique III. Verano had a consultation with Dr Pepe. When doc was about to examine him, his genital was rooted. Charlie Tiongson's mouth was there because of kissing. That was only a hearsay. You're such a killjoy. It's okay. It's funny anyway. Who cares? It's funny because it's true. You are right. I'll just put it up outside. Just continue talking there. All right. Oh, ask for Otek's help. Otek! Help Ramon there in the front. Otek! So I know some stories about the mayor... ...but what's going on between the mayor and Ricky Verano? That two families... ...are allies for a long time. Did you see the factory? The old factory in San Fernando? Also, the housing project... ...in the riverside... ...well, they're all Veranos. Well, they're Veranos before but... ...Veranos left before People Power I. I think all the people here... ...were given a job and fired from the job. I think there's only one left who's an employee of Verano. The mayor? You are right. Good. Me? I don't support worthless people. Okay. Find a way. You can do that. I'll go ahead. Bye. -Rough day? -That was nothing. Just an election bullshit in the north. -Where in the north? -Talisay. Talisay? It's nothing. Just a worthless town in the north. You probably never heard of it. A city girl like you. Unless... ...if you move there. Right. I think I will move there. Anyway, I'm still quite mad at you. You suddenly disappear. And then one day... ...you'd call and wanted to see me. Because I'm missing you. Is that bad? You didn't even text me or even a greeting over the radio. I thought we were close. How long have we been together? Almost seven years... ...Mr Ricky Verano. You know you're the only one. I know but what's this drama's all about? No news. You were as if... ...devoured by earth. I know you so well. You can't just walk away from it. You must missed it. Somehow. You're the only one I'm missing. Only you. Anyway... ...how was Paula's graduation? First honorable mention. Best in Math and Science. She has lots of fans. It's almost an hour before we got out of the auditorium. Like father, like daughter. Is Olivia there? That bitch. Well... ...she went to Hong Kong with her new DI. That bitch spent all my hard-earned money to that bastard man. Well, it's a tie. You're not an angel anyway. That motherfucker woman. Anyway... ...what's up? Nothing much. But one night, I got bored. I want some thrill, that's why... -...I went to casino. -Really? The men were checking up on me there but... ...my mood was look but don't touch so nothing happened at first. So I looked for a fearless man there. And then? He was standing across the room. He's not young but not that old either. I think he's in his 40s. He's confident. Powerful. Has a strong appeal. In fact... ...he reminded of someone I'm very fond of. Do you reject Satan and all his works... ...and all his empty promises? I do. Do you believe in God, the Father Almighty... ...creator of heaven and earth? -I do. -I do. Evan, be sealed with the gift of the Holy Spirit. Amen. -Peace be with you. -And also with you. -Nico... -You're handsome when you dress well. Peace be with you. Tomas, be sealed with the gift of the Holy Spirit. Amen. -Peace be with you. -And also with you. -Happy birthday. -Oh, what's this? I don't know. It's from your mother. Really? I'm sure you will like that. Basketball shoes. Wear it. Let me see. It's beautiful. What was her name again? Come on, tell me. Maggie. -Magdalen Morada. -Magdalen Morada. Cool. Is she pretty? She's okay. Do you remember... ...the one we watched last time? "Naruto?" -Ninja? -Yes, that one. Maggie looks like Sakura. Who is Sakura there? The one with the pink hair. Pink hair? Wow, that's beautiful. So Maggie's hair is pink as well? Of course not. What a stupid question. I didn't know. She might be crazy or something. You're the one who's crazy. You're so sensitive. So did you tell her you like her? Not yet. Good afternoon. Goddess of glamor. Are you talking about me when I'm not around? Of course not. Only your great personality, Your Majesty. Shut up, Ramon, or else I will punch your bulbous nose. You're such a killjoy. I only walk this prince home... ...safe and sound... ...as per your wish. We are grateful, mister. Adios, senorita. Bye. So how was the game? It was fun. Ramon taught me... ...the crossover of Dondon Hontiveros. And we won. And your smell is a winner as well. Go take a bath. Okay. -There's a Coke in the ref. -Later. Do you want fish balls? I'm still full. He's denying it, boss. Everything? Yes. Everything, boss. He doesn't know about the biddings and constructions in the market. So he doesn't have anything to tell to the press. And if ever he knows something... ...he won't tell it. Really? He's that kind? He wanted to talk to you personally. And why is that? He said he's your nephew. Tell him to talk to you instead. I don't need his confession. Because we know that he's the one who spread the news, right? So if I were you... ...I won't talk to him anymore. I will just end it. Any updates on mother? Didn't I tell you that she called last time? No, you didn't. What did she say? She said she's okay. She's a bit tired from working and summer is already approaching there. Did she ask about me? Of course. I told her you're growing taller. But you're not that good in Math. That's not true. It's my teacher who's not good in teaching Math. Oh, really? Come on, prove it. Give me a perfect score in your Math test. What will be my prize first? What do you want? Bring me to Manila. If you get the perfect score... It should be perfect, okay? ...we'll go to Manila. Promise? We'll eat lunch at McDonald's, watch movie in Robinson's... ...ice cream in Luneta and then mami and siomai in Ongpin for dinner. -Game? -Game. -Perfect score, okay? -Perfect. Hey, Jake, change player when one loses, okay? -Okay, 10-peso bet. -All right, okay. That's nice. Oh, by the way, Tomas, I'll show you something. What is it? Here. Nice, right? Wow, bro, where did you get it? Quiet. This is my uncle's. When my parents converted to Born Again Christian... ...they burned all his magazines... ...and comics. Good thing, I managed to keep one. Can I borrow this? -Sure. Sure. -I'll take care of this. Promise. But don't fantasize on that, Tomas. I know you. Thank you for supporting Doc Pepe. And then on Friday... ...we'll put posters, don't forget that. -On Friday? -Okay. -All right. -All right. We'll go ahead. Bye-bye. Thank you again. I hope you were there last night. It was so much fun. Doc Pepe was there and being funny as usual. The volunteers you recruited were hardworking. You know what, darling... ...my whole life has been in the politics. My father served for 25 years as a barangay captain. And this is one of the important things I've learned. Do you know what's the most powerful group... ...that a politician can form? The wives? Housewives, darling. Listening to radio drama for so many years is sometimes tiring. So if there's a chance for some action... ...grab it, sister. And if it's time for spreading rumors... ...all the details should be complete. We have so many assets in every site. When it comes to black propaganda... ...oh, my God... ...it will be hard for them to fight the women like us. Right, sister? Sorry if you're working until now. It's almost 9 PM. I was talking earlier to the Church of Christ people. They chose... Us? Of course. Us. -Wow. -We got the Church of Christ votes. We got them. That's good. -Because we're hardworking. -Thanks. -I'm hungry and I know you're hungry too. -Yes, we are. -I... -That's good news. Yes. I asked Lino to buy food. Here is... Oh, there he is. Just in time. -I asked Lino to buy food. -Here it is. Praise the Lord! Hallelujah. -Did you buy it all? -Yes, doc. There. This one is mine. -Thank you, doc. -This is delicious. Thank you for the food. You know what... ...you eat again. Come on, eat again. Rest first before having a second round. By the way, your inaugural speech should be ready. -It should be all set. -No. There's no need for that. If I lose, then I'll go back to my own life. I'm like... I'm like... ...David and he's Goliath. Oh, no, no, no, this is much better. I am Morales and he's Pacquiao. That's it. At least our fight continues. I think Talisay is ready for a new government. Wanna bet? What are you smiling at? Sweetheart... ...a lady reveals nothing. Well... ...they're putting up with me... ...all this time. I might as well give you something to smile about. Happy birthday, darling. This is a blank check. We've been together for a long time. And I know... ...I sometimes forget to tell you how important you are to me. You have complete freedom to buy anything with that money. Thank you, sweetheart. I can't wait to see... ...what you'd spend it on. Neither can I. The election is getting serious. Why serious? All our posters in our street... ...were vandalized. -Really? -What? Who did that? Darling, it's obvious who did that. Then let's get our revenge. Shit! We're playing fair here. We don't do that in our campaign. Don't retaliate. Don't retaliate with whom? Doc, it's because... ...our posters were vandalized. They weren't torn apart but they were full of scribbles. What was written on it? Stupid. Dwarf. Uncircumcised. Am I that small? Oh, well, let it be. You know what, Donna's right. Don't engage on that because election is like that, right? There's really like that. Dwarf. So how's Iloilo? Everything is working fine. There's a regular shipment from Cebu. I'm having it monitored... ...so there will be no freelancers... ...that will connect with our goods. Especially if they're mixing other things in the drugs. Quality control. That's good. Do we have the three main areas? -Bakhaw, Zamora, Esperanza. -Wow. Who's our people there? Utak, sir. -Utak? Evangelista? -Yes, sir. Good. What about Talisay? We're safe there. Really? Even Sofia? You were right about her actions. So predictable that girl. Just like the fool... the fool Holganza. But keep an eye on her, Ramon. That kid is clever. He will not be a problem, boss. It should be. Yes, sir. I heard that Tiongson is already giving money. Really? How much? Not necessarily big. Just like what happened in Barangay San Roque. That's where the biggest urban poor is located here in Talisay. What Tiongson's men did... ...was they give something for the Noche Buena. A liter of soft drinks, a loaf of bread, and a bottle of Cheez Whiz. And he won by a landslide last election. Because of that? Darling, for people who have hungry kids, that will be enough. It's like Santa Claus came down from heaven and run for mayor. In North Pole, Mother. It's Jesus Christ who came from heaven. Right. It's confusing. It's because they have the same birthday. -Does that mean we lose? -Not yet. You mean... ...people need to have a conscience to return the money to Tiongson? No need. Let them have it. Let's just double it so they'll think that they're leading. But we should do it now. If we'll do it later... ...we might not able to catch up. Sorry, Mother. Hey, remember Prospero? Do you know Prospero? -Who is that? -He's doc's personnel in Isabel. The one who serenaded Mrs Puring last time. -From Tienda Talisay? -Yes. -I remember him. -You remember? Prospero is dead. He was found... His tricycle was found in... ...the cliff. The police said that it seems like he was killed by the bandits. Robbery homicide. Was his wallet's taken? He has no wallet. He's just a plumber. I don't know how much money he really brings. Robbery. He was put to death. -Excuse me, I need to take this call. -Otek. All right. You really... ...want to hear a school girl like me to speak naughty, right? I really want it so bad. I know that... ...it turns you on. So... ...your two friends will join us tonight. Have they ever been with a... ...a woman like me? They're just very curious. I really don't meet with new clients. But since they're your friends... ...I can make an exception. They will come from the party later. But they agreed on your price. I feel that... ...it's going to be a long night. They're already here. They're just parking. All right! Let's the party begin! This is what our friend is bragging about. Cheng, please. Emerson, please. -Don't. -Cheng, please. Stop it. Hello, Sofia. Come on, Juls. -Please stop it. -Relax, Juls. I'm not doing anything to your girl. -Stop it. -Come on. Juls. -Good, man. -Come on, Juls. Please. Stop this already. This is not funny anymore, Cheng. Shut up, Julie! You know what? This fantasy shit is right. This is the cue! -Where are you going? -Stop it, dude. Are you gonna fight against me, huh? You motherfucker! You stupid shit! Why are you making me angry? -Stop! -You piece of shit! You motherfucker! You stupid shit! What? I know your names and where you live. I will kill you both if you come back here again. Do you understand? I don't know if... ...I need to explain something or you are. The first time I went to Manila... ...I didn't expect that it will be hard. I didn't know that you can die of starvation. If you're not being careful. It doesn't seem obvious now but... ...I've experienced starvation as well. Good thing someone helped me. Verano. He trusted me. He gave me a job. If what the people are saying were true... ...that Ricky Verano is the Satan... ...then my life belongs to a demon. Are you here to kill me? He doesn't know I'm here. -Why are you here? -I don't know. But I know what you've been doing. You're pretending that you're joining in a beauty pageant... ...but you're performing for one person only. Are you keeping an eye on me for your boss? No. What are you doing then? Is this turning you on? Is this making you hard? Donna, Verano has nothing to do with it, okay? We're friends. If you're not here for me... ...then it's really Pepe. Believe it or not... ...I wasn't ask to check on Pepe. Do you think I'm gullible? Who do you think you're fooling? Why are you doing this for Verano? I'm doing this for Pepe, Donna. For him. Verano didn't order me. I came to Pepe to help him. What about you? Why are you helping him? You want to know? You're all a bunch of shit. The only thing I wished for... ...is a peaceful life. I'm tired of being a prostitute. But even in any part... ...of the world... ...that I went to, Verano is still there. Even in a worthless... ...place like Talisay... ...he's still there. He's not letting me go. He will pay for this. And... ...I believe in... ...what Pepe's fighting for. Pepe is a decent man, Donna. He's fit to be a mayor in Talisay. I want him to win... ...but he will not win. If he will continue this fucking boy scout thing... -Pepe can defeat Tiongson. -He can't. While Verano is making sure... ...that Tiongson is still the mayor. If Pepe won't know how to play... ...he won't stand a chance. Pepe won't do that. Yeah, that's right. That's why he will lose. -Talisay -Tiongson He will fulfill his mission -Vote him for mayor -Charlie Tiongson Tiongson -"Crazy In Love." -No, no. That's "Crazy In Love". That's always "Crazy In Love". -That's her favorite dance. -Never mind. She was good last night. Best in talent portion. With tumbling, holding two color blue dogs. There she is. Miss Mega Manila. What are you eating? I bought cheese, bread and instant noodles for the kid. Instant noodles and cheese? That's not an ordinary cheese. That's from Cebu. There are still eggs left. Do you want scrambled or fried? What happened to your face? Miss America gone berserk last night. So, what is it? Scrambled or fried? By the way... ...I need to go to Manila... ...to buy some roll film in Quiapo. -I wanna come with you. -No, Tomas. Why not? It's Saturday, right? And you should be in-charge of the store. I'm going to school every day... ...and then watching the store on Saturday and Sunday... ...when am I going to Manila? Your life must be so hard, right? I told you that we'll go to Manila. Where is your test anyway? None yet. -Bring the kid. -Oh... ...yeah, right... ...because we know he won't be harmed in the city. Oh, shit! What a moron. Look what they've done. Wait a minute. We need to fix this. We should be. Tiongson's men are bunch of jerks. Do you still have posters left? Wait a minute. We don't have posters any more. You know what, we don't need posters. Bring that here. What's your plan? Look if there's people. Let's go. I'm hungry. Oh, aunt, why are you early? I'm tired and I haven't slept yet. Oh, here's your dinner. It's okay. I'll eat that after I study. You're with Mayor Tiongson, right? Yes. We're with Mayor Tiongson. Why? Because... ...I lost my copy. Sample ballot? Why? Are you a voter? A first-timer. Thank you for your support but our sample ballot is out of stock. Also... ...we need to make another because... ...the three candidates were removed from the line up of mayor. Why? You don't know? Arturo, Yap and Delgado were arrested in the drug raid in Manila. They're always buying meths there. Really? Mayor Tiongson... ...already knew about this but he's hiding it. It's embarrassing. We, the supporters, were disappointed. Oh, okay. All right, okay. Thank you, I'll tell this to my father. He despises drug addicts. -Thank you. -Okay. Were they really got arrested? No. But those three addicts should have been arrested a long time ago. Oh, my God, Donna, we fooled the guy. We didn't fool him, Dixie. We're campaigning. Tiongson's men do this as well and you know that. The game is fair and square. I know that they're doing that... ...but I still don't want it. I mean... ...Doc Pepe might regret it when he knew... How will he know? Will you tell him? Of course not. I'm just saying that I'm not comfortable. That's only one person, Dixie. One vote. If we make him vote for Doc Pepe... ...doesn't that mean we already did our job? -Go. -Cheers. Go. Go. Okay. That's the last. We are in our second bottle. -Go on. -Okay. -Just continue the fun. -Wait, this is for the demon. What a waste. How will it be a waste when it's for the demon? Oh, speaking of demon, tell them the story. -What's that? -The one you told me earlier. You know, my cousin... ...was a former driver of De Calma before he ran for vice mayor of Tiongson. He told me... ...that De Calma... ...is a VIP in a brothel in Cainta. They call it... ...Clouds. "Clouds." That's funny. They always give him lots of women there. The pimp there is a huge woman, looks like a pregnant cow when standing. And she always wore a crown as if she's the Queen Helena. Take a shot first. I told you, De Calma is really a pervert. Excuse me, I have to call someone. Donna really has a lot of phone pals. Hello? Friend. Hey, how are you? This is Sofia. Sofia Vergara. I know. Long time no speak. Wait, you're working with Mommy Gretchen, right? In Clouds? Good. Good. I have a sideline job for you. You were taking videos of your VIP clients there, right? I want you to find a video for me. Your VIP client from Talisay. A politician. His name is De Calma. Of course. This will be a big money. All right. I'll call you tomorrow, okay? Okay. Thank you. Bye. Hey, man. How are you, Bisaya? Oh, you brought your girlfriend. You're unbelievable. Tomas is cool. -Want a cigarette? -No, no, it's okay. -What about you, Tomas? -Pass. I have an asthma. Asthma? Do you really have an asthma or a pussy? You fool. Where are we going, sexy? You're checking up on chicks again. What a long tongue. Nice! Your hair is so long just like a horse's tail. -You're such a bully. -What about you, Tomas? Do you like girls? -Of course, man. -Yes, he likes girls, man. He likes Maggie Morada. Maggie Morada. -She's sexy, right? -Yes. She's nice. Is she your girlfriend? -No. -Not yet. Not yet? Did you kiss her? Not yet. I'm just playing it cool. You're just playing with yourself. Court her, man. Or else, we'll court her if you prolong it. -That's right. -Relax, man. I'm trying to woo her. Man, do you know who's the real sexy? -Who? -Tomas's gay mother. -Oh, my. -She's a whore, right? -She's not my mother. -That's right, you stupid. How can a gay be your mother? Even if she's not your mother, you still live under one roof. Your clothes, your food... You don't know if that gay has bacteria. -That's right. -And then, you'll be gay as well. Right, Tomas? Do you still have a cigarette? Pepe found out... ...that Lino vandalized Tiongson's posters. He asked Jerry to follow him... ...because there are lots of complaints already. I didn't know that Lino can do that. We know him as someone... ...who talks like a brute. I thought he's just all talk and no action. It's his fault. What did you say? He shouldn't have cheated. If Tiongson's people caught him... ...Doc will be blamed for that. And he got caught, so... ...he deserves it. Dixie... ...are you really a virgin? You know, I understand this holy nerd image of yours. It looks sexy like a Catholic school girl or a horny librarian. Donna... I really get it. Honestly. For sure you are hiding something. It's fine, I won't reveal it. It's your strategy. If that's really you... ...that would be a waste. You know in Manila... ...girls would kill to have a lip surgery... ...just like yours. Perfect... ...cocksucker lips. Donna... ...you've gone a little overboard. What are you thinking? You. I've been thinking a lot about you this past week. And then... ...I have a surprise for you as well. Really? -What's that? -It won't be a surprise anymore if I tell. Is that so? What if I tell you... ...that whatever your surprise is... ...my next surprise will be way better. Really, Ricky? Is that a dare? Try me. Anyway... ...I have a confession to make. I've been... ...a very, very bad girl. I went with my girlfriends in Eastwood last week. I saw a 20-something guy. He's the same age as your nephew. Shit, he's so gorgeous and delicious. He's really built for fucking. Really? Anyway... ...I told the girls that I'll walk up and say hi, the next thing I know... ...we were already checking in a hotel. When he took off his shirt... ...glorious pecs... ...ripped abs... ...and a trail fine hair. ...running down the front of his... Wait... ...I'll just smoke. No, Ricky. This time... This time... ...you go down on me. Yeah? Hello? I'm here with the money. Did you bring the pictures? Good. I'll come inside in a bit. Okay. Bye. -I have a question. -What is it? Is having sex painful? Lemuel said that it's good. But it looks painful. Are you on drugs? No. Why are you asking that? That was our lesson in Science. And then right after the class... ...we talked about that... -...and they told me to ask you... -Enough. -But... -Stop. That topic is not allowed in this house. At all. So tell your rude and derelict friends... ...that you don't care about that kind of thing. You're too young for that. Do you understand? San Vicente said to wait for the result of the investigation... ...before accusing the suspect. In other news... ...a mayoralty candidate was involved in a smuggled medicine scandal... ...in the town of Talisay... ...in the province of Del Sur. According to the reports in "Talisay Times"... ...the independent mayoralty candidate... ...Dr Pepe Holganza... ...is included in the list of suspected doctors... ...who is spreading medicines that are not BFAD approved... ...and entered illegally in the Philippines. Holganza denied the issue... ...and said it's a black propaganda from his contenders... ...in the coming election. Next is the news in other parts of the country... ...when we return. You really won't stop until Pepe's name is ruined. Good morning to you as well. I heard it on the radio earlier. Are you and your boss happy now, huh? I thought we already had an agreement, then why are you scolding me? Talisay needs Pepe. It's not only the town you're betraying, your family as well. Wow. You are taking the election personally. Is it really Talisay that needs Pepe or is it you? You're using... You're just using him to escape your problems. What do you care? -Who are you really supporting? -We're just the same. ...but with different groups. Aren't you gonna answer that... ...Sofia? You son of a bitch. Six over 15, four over 10... Tomas. Tomas. Tomas. Where did you hide the other magazines? Answer me. Bring me to Manila. -In the beauty pageant. -Tomas... ...we've already talked about this. The beauty pageant... Is for adults. Yes, I know. That's what you're gonna say, right? Don't be a smart ass, Tomas. Do you know that they're laughing at me? -Do you know what they're thinking? -What? You don't want me to bring to Manila because you're a prostitute. Sorry for waiting, Donna, the check up took so long. It's okay, doc. I just wanted to give this. What's that? Your supporters had a fund raising and then... Sorry, I won't accept that. It's okay, doc. -Don't worry, this is just a donation. -Donna... ...I can't accept that, I'm really sorry. I'll ask you. What if I ask you where that money came from... ...will you tell it to me? They don't want to be known. That is not just an ordinary donation then. Anonymous donation. It seems... It seems that it's not good to hear... ...that two days from now is the election day. I think so. Donna... ...I trust you. You know that winning is not our only goal... ...but to show them that we have a strong principle... ...and we can do that without cheating. They've been giving me false accusations. Good thing, the people... ...didn't believe on those accusations. But... ...if they found something suspicious... ...like we cheated... ...threatened someone or lied... ...accepted... ...anonymous donation... ...then it will be nothing. We will still lose. If that's the only way to win, then I'd rather lose. Ola, senorita. It's already midnight. Is there an emergency? Do you know how to buy votes? Why? How much do we need? This close to election? Pepe doesn't have enough money. Are the housewives of Talisay need help? You know that you can put any amount here. You can buy... ...anything. I want a clarification. What do you want me to do with this check? Buy me a new mayor. Provincial board. "Jose. "Alberto. "Diaz. "Senator. "Navarro." "Palma." "Mayor. "Holganza." "Vice mayor. Faustino." Mayor! Mayor! Mayor! Mayor! Mayor! Mayor! Mayor! Mayor! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Wow, I was surprised that we're all here. Because of that, I'm not the only winner. We are all winners! -Applause. -Yay! Hurray for mayor! And because of that, we've shown that we can win... ...without getting our hands dirty. And we have a strong principle. And because of that, let's give ourselves a round of applause. Mayor! Mayor! Mayor! Mayor! And... ...of course we'll still stay here in our town... ...and we'll serve the public. This is my promise to you. Thanks to all of you and let's cheer to that. You're great, Donna. Really great. And the planning and logistics are good. Can you imagine we almost got into trouble for three... No, four times... ...but good thing you were there. And then you said that you're new to this. I just followed your order. No, I think you're a fast learner. Not really. I know that you have a lot to do. We have a lot to do. And we still have a lot to do. What? I chose you as my executive secretary. Me? You're new but... ...you were respected by your colleagues as a leader. Dixie regards you as a goddess. And Ruby and Ramon... Oh, my, did you know that Lino is accusing you... ...of being a culprit of... ...vandalizing Tiongson's posters. But... but no one believed him. You're hardworking. And... ...you work calmly. And you're not seeking attention. And that's... That's the image I want for our new government. Hello? Yes, governor. Hey. Congratulations too. Hey, don't get mad with your sister Donna. She has a lot of on her mind because of Doc Pepe's campaign. But I hope you didn't tell her what you said because that hurts. I believe in her. I know that she won't lie to me. It's just hard that no one believes that I'm proud of her. If only there are pictures of her winning every pageant as a proof. But there's none. Even Maggie is disgusted with me. Well, if Maggie doesn't like you anymore then we'll look for a new crush. Like the deserving. Right... ...cool Tomas? They're nothing against you. Wait, why did you bring your camera? The election has ended. Doc Pepe will have a victory party later. Do you want to be the photographer in the party later? So I can drink properly. I'll teach you. There. Wait, I'll turn it on. Look there. All right. I'll go home first to freshen up. Let's meet at the party later. Just make sure you'll take more pictures of your sister Donna. She will like that. She's still mad at me. -And she'll not attend. -Why not? She left a letter earlier. It's Miss Gay's grand finals. She doesn't know what time she's going home. She put a lot of clothes in her bag earlier. Really? See you later. Wait, you left your camera. Where are you going? -Hello, Ramon. -Where are you going? Make a guess. What you're planning is not good, Donna. You're kidding, right? I don't even know why it took me seven months... ...to think of leaving Talisay. But we won. Really? Why do I feel like we lose? Don't leave. Are you blind, Ramon? I don't have a place here in Talisay. I don't belong here. I don't belong with people here. What about Tomas? I'm going. Tomas will live with Ruby. If it's okay... ...just visit him from time to time. Just the person I was hoping to see. Wow. This is romantic. Wow. -Sexy dress. -Thank you. So, this warehouse is still up. Oh, you still remember. Just like yesterday. This is where you got your first millions, right? Among other things... ...this is where our first time, remember? It seems not so long ago. And you still remember it. Oh, you brought your suitcase. Did you come to your senses that's why you're going back to Manila? It depends. So why did you ask me to come here? Tonight is a very special night. It seems like you're sad. Wait. I know how to cheer you up. What's your surprise? You'll see. -I'm waiting. -Yes. What's that noise? Just wait and see. I'm starting to be impatient. -Tomas? -Happy anniversary, darling. Tomas. Tomas. He has nothing to do with it. Let him go. -Well, he's already here. -Let him go. I don't seem to know this fantasy. Wait, let me guess. Foster mother... ...moral crusader? It doesn't fit. It seems like a gay Pepe Holganza. Is this because of money? You told me I can do anything with that money. Didn't you get it? I really wanted the money to go to Pepe. What do you mean? Tiongson is useless. All he does is brag. And his two kids... ...are both jerks. What will I gain with him? But Pepe... ...is smart, strong... ...fit to be a mayor, right? It's too bad that you sabotaged him. What are you talking about? Oh, my, darling. He got into trouble because of you. Are you stupid? What is this stupidity? Tomorrow morning... ...it will be on the newspaper... ...that Holganza will be caught vote buying. And in the following days... ...the check will appear. My people from the bank will tell me... ...to whom they give it. To the known staff of Pepe. You paid... ...everyone. The poll watchers... ...the people in Comelec. All of them... ...received the money from you. And from there, people will know... ...that they were almost fooled by this son of a bitch Pepe! He's also a fraud. Acting as innocent. A pretentious. I'm the one who did the vote buying. He has nothing to do with it. But he still benefited from it. Why do you have to kidnap the kid? He doesn't know anything. You can't accuse me of that. He went here all by himself. He just wanted to see Manila... ...and watched you win in the beauty pageant. How sweet. Here's what you're going to do. You're gonna make sure that my sideline is still up and running in Talisay. If Holganza will not join... ...it's up to him. Just make sure he won't go against me. What about your expose? One telephone call... ...my friends in the media will hide it.. All I need to hear... ...is that you'll commit to me. If you don't want to... ...you won't like what I would do to you... ...and to this kid. I'll give you time to think. If you want. I've already decided. I can't do what you want. Are you joking? Nobody says no to me, Sofia. You know that. How can I change your mind? You know what, Tomas... I am really close with... ...Donna. Your sister Donna. In fact... ...I have complete... -...videos of her beauty pageants. -No. No. No. -Emil... -No, Ricky. ...give me the video. Yes. Yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. You're so good. You're so good. Fuck you, yeah. It's so good. Enough. You don't need a video. So, what now, Donna? Did it change your mind? Are you ready to fulfill... ...your role in new Talisay? If that's the only way to win... ...I'd rather lose. Ramon... Tomas... ...please forgive me. Close your eyes. Tomas. Close your eyes.
