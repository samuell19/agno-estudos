There. See that? We didn't see nothing, stranger. I see'd you sewing, though. First time I ever see a man sew like that. I done tailoring. How much you want to sew the seat in a pair of britches? I don't want work here. I'm going west. I don't, uh, aim to take something for nothing. I'll... I'll patch them britches. Pretty square tailor, ain't ya? Sit down till I get my garment. Where you coming from, stranger? East. Where you heading? West. What do you want out there? Land. Don't talk much, do you? Not unless I get something to say. - Here she is. - Uh... It might take a week of filing. I-if you get your nippers, you could... You're a fugitive. - I'd be aiding. - You, uh... I-- I was, uh, I was bound to a tailor back in Carolina. Runaway apprentice? You don't look young enough for that. You think I'm lying. Well, here. Read this. When an apprentice lights out and gets caught again he's got to serve out his time, don't he? - Miss Eliza! Miss Eliza! - Look! Well, where'd you get that? Howdy, Miss McCardle. Oh, good day, Blackstone. - Hello, Sam, Mordecai. - Howdy, Miss McCardle. - McCardle. - Hello, Mrs. Fisher. Good afternoon. You know those new boxes of books that came? I figured out how much shelf space is wanted, see? If you could bring some boards and a hammer and some nails-- I'll be right up to the library, Miss McCardle, as soon as I get Mrs. Fisher's mule shoed up. - Hello, Sheriff. - Good afternoon, McDaniel. Mordecai, who is he? Says he's apprentice what lit out. That what it says there? Yes, but they can't touch a runaway apprentice here in Tennessee, across the state line. Forget what I asked you, I'll patch your britches, as pay for this file here and be getting down the road. Never mind the britches now. Come here. Put your foot up here. This might hurt some, tailor. Huh, hurts worse where it is. What the Sam Hill? Well, that's like spring steel. Yeah. Get--get your hammer and chisel. But it'll half-kill you. It's been too long I got this thing on. I'm warning you, you might lose your ankle. Will you get your chisel? Go on, get it! He wants to be mule-headed... Speaking of mule.. Gram of White Mule might help some. I.--I can't touch that stuff. It makes me sicker than a hound dog. You know, this town could maybe use a man like you. Don't talk much, don't drink, lots of spunk. Ain't been a tailor hereabouts since ol' Finney got drunk and sewed his finger to a leg of the parson's pants. I ain't looking to do tailoring, ma'am. Man what can get to own land don't get chained up. Man who can sew like you could soon buy an acre here. Lots of folks here ain't got no basement nor britches. Brace his foot. Good morning! - Morning, Miss McCardle. - Morning, Miss Eliza. Oh, that's a fine job, Mordecai. I'm getting a pair of brand-new britches for doing this. Well, I thought those old ones of yours would be too much for any tailor. Well, Mrs. Fisher! Them cobwebs ain't been swept out since the Grangers lit out west, Miss McCardle. And I'll be choking and spitting for weeks to get the dust out of my lungs. Well, aren't you a good neighbor? I ain't been messing about in there to help that mule head. I'm a-gettin' paid. I'm gonna have the first new dress since the one I wore the day the parson tied me up. Good morning, Mr. Johnson. Morning. We haven't exactly met before. I'm Eliza McCardle from the library across the street. Yes, miss. Everyone's so pleased to have a tailor here again in Greeneville. Thank you, miss. I-it saves so much trouble not having to take my cloak and dress down to Nashville. Am I your first customer? Oh. It was you left that? I guess you are, then, miss. Is my work ready? Oh, you shouldn't be about on that foot. It does a man's foot good getting a shackle knocked off it. Yes, of course. Everyone's talking about what happened at the blacksmith's shop. What happened at the blacksmith's ain't nobody's business! Mr. Johnson. Forgot myself, miss, don't... don't pay no mind. I'll take my clothes now, if you please. There ain't nothing been done to them clothes, miss. Those clothes. But the instructions are plainly written. I know, miss, but... I can't read. "Will you please lengthen the dress two inches at the hem and mend tear in cloak." I'll have it fixed tomorrow. Oh. How much will it cost? I ain't asking no favors from anybody, but... a fair bargain's a fair bargain. I don't understand. You... you know about books? A little, yes, but... I asked you how much my work would cost. And you--you speak nice. "Them clothes," I said. Oh, I corrected you. It--it just slipped out. It was forward of me, I'm afraid. No, miss. I-I got to learn to speak right. You speak about the nicest I know of. Miss McCardle, I'll sew you all the clothes you can bring me, homespun, if you'll learn me to read and write. Your proposal, Mr. Johnson, seems rather unusual. Miss McCardle. I'll think it over. I-- I'm making you a fair offer. I-I never had no chance to learn. Will you learn me? I have never had a chance to learn. Will you teach me. Will you teach me? "There is a lady sweet and kind, was never face so pleased my mind, I did but see her passing by and yet I love her till I die." Please go on. It's past time to close the library. Got to get home and read something besides poetry. Andrew. You've learned to read almost as well as I. You've made so many new clothes for me, it's almost sinful. Why do you want to go on with the lessons? Is this the... Words, I read somewhere, are verses the heart sets to music. Eliza, there's... music inside me that almost drowns out my thinking. But I'm a poor man and the law says a white man without property is nothing but a mudsill for other men to wipe their boots on. Why, no law says that. It don't have to say it, it's true, ain't it? Your people owned a house and land. How did my father get a house and land? By cobbling shoes for 20 years. My father was nothing but a mudsill, and he died one. Poor white trash, that was him, and that's me. I'll be going now. Andrew. Don't you know we were all mudsills once? Forget the history of England for tonight. Read your own history. Here. The Declaration of Independence. I've heard that spouted by stump speakers every Fourth of July since I can remember. Well, maybe you didn't understand it. Read this part here. "We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal." Uh, they're fine words, but they ain't true. Ain't no equality for mudsills. Go on. "That they are... endowed by their Creator with certain... unalin--una--" "Unalienable rights." Rights no man can take away. Well, they have taken them away. What are you making me read this for, anyway? Go on. "That among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Why, a man ain't even got a right to vote without he owns property. Then why don't you make it your business to see that men without property are given the right to vote? - My business? - Certainly. You've got a temper, Andrew, but people like you. Go out and talk to them. Make speeches. Stand up for your rights and theirs, too. People wouldn't listen to me. I think they would. Anyway, the Constitution says you can try to make them listen. I s-suppose you'll be making me read the Constitution out loud to you. I will, if it will help you to understand it and realize that everything in the Bill of Rights and the Declaration, too, means you, personally. You, Andrew Johnson. It seems as--as if... Maybe I never really understood this before. The Constitution, neither. I suppose plain people can't agitate the way you want me to in them foreign countries. - Those foreign countries. - Those. No, of course they can't. The reason this is a free country is because here, what's wrong can be set right. Whatever is wrong has got to be set right by the people. You're the people. This is your country as much as theirs. It's my--my fish in the stream. Your flag on the fort. "It's life, liberty..." Finish the sentence, Andrew. "The pursuit of happiness." They're all yours. The pursuit of happiness, too. The pursuit of happiness. And it says we were created... Go on. Equal. What it says must be right, Andrew. Created equal, you and me. Yes, Andrew. "Votes for all free men." More than a year now, he's been putting leveling ideas like that into common folks' heads, Sheriff. Mm-hmm. White trash got enough to do hustling to make a living. And not sticking their snouts into what don't rightly concern them. Goes on like this, he'll rouse up the whole county. Too many property interests involved, Sheriff Cass. You see, Mrs. Johnson, them that own the country should run it. A man with land pays taxes, don't he? So ain't it right that he should have a say how the money is spent? Now you tell your husband to leave voting to the men of property. They'll look after the interests of folks like you. Well, surely, that's a matter of opinion, Sheriff. You have no right to keep him from speaking. Bill of Rights says there should be no law made to abridge freedom of speech. We're living in Tennessee. Well, we ain't abiding by no federal laws, less'n they suit us. Well, nothing's legal in this town if the Aldermen don't like it. Now, they don't like tailors rousing up the white trash and making leveling speeches. Goodnight. Uh, now don't forget, you tell Andy he ain't gonna hold no more meetings. Now, he's got a temper. Better make him see reason, else'n he might get hurt. - Evening, Eliza. - Evening. You're late for supper, dear. I had to go over and fit Mr. Bronson's coat. What was that hard-shelled, rum-dipped sheriff doing here? What's the matter, Martha? Hey, she ain't sick, is she? No, no, it's just her teeth bothering her. She used to sleep all the time. Now take your coats right off. Andrew, I kept a nice bit of salt pork warm and those baby cabbages you like so much. There's plenty for Mordecai, too. Uh, that's mighty fine of you, but it'll taste just as good cold. It's time to get my notes and go to the meeting. You'd better mind little Martha. I'd make a lot better speech with you there listening. Why, Eliza, you're all tensed up. Andrew, that meeting last week, there was some trouble, wasn't there? It didn't come to anything. Yes, but if one night it did, if someone got hurt... Eliza, what... what was Cass doing here? Ain't exactly like the sheriff to come social visiting. Eliza? Well, he came to say that the Aldermen won't allow the meeting tonight. Won't allow it? Well, I've got a piece to speak. That's what free speech is in the Constitution for, so as I can speak it. - Come on, Milligan. - We'll get our friends. What he really came to say was you can't hold meetings at all anymore or you might get hurt. Andrew, put away that gun. Please. - Stay home. - No, Eliza. Andrew, you shan't do this. You shan't! Nothing can keep me from going. Andrew! Mordecai! Don't worry none, Eliza. I promise, nothing will happen to Andrew. Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! There's been a bad ruckus at the town hall! No. No, you mind the baby. My husband. What happened? Where are they? Them that got hurt was carried over to the blacksmith's shop. Water! Get some water! Wh-where is... Where is... Anybody want to buy a first-rate blacksmith's shop? Mordecai Milligan's dead. - Where are you going? - To get Sheriff Cass. That ain't no private affair of yourn. How many men can we get together? I got close to 20 cousins in the county ain't standing by and see me get no hammering. And how about Milligan's kin? They ain't gonna put up with his killing. We can raise a 100 men by midnight. Them with no guns have scythes and axes. Round 'em up! Let's get started! If it's killing they want, let's give it to 'em! If I hadn't toted that gun, Milligan would be asleep in his bed in there. Not dead in it. That's right! And we're gonna make 'em pay for it! Put down those weapons! You're quitting on us, tailor? I ain't never quitting. From now on, never. Then come along! Join the party! You begun this, Andy, with your meetings and your telling us to stick up for our rights. You led the scrimmage when the sheriff's bullies started throwing us out the hall. You done more than your share of fighting your own self. And who pulled the gun first? It'll take me more than all my life... to pay for that. He's quitting on us. - Come on! - No! Mob fighting, shooting, and hanging and burning, that ain't the way! Eye for eye, tooth for tooth! That's Bible! So you want to start killing. First you kill, the militia comes from Nashville, then they start killing. And the dead they leave are you, Maude Fisher. And, Dick, you. And, Ebenezer, you. And, Ethan, you. And you. And you, McDaniel. Yes, I--I tell you to fight for your rights. But the Constitution ain't for the dead, it's to protect the living! Ain't nothing in it I know of says not to hang a murdering sheriff! It--it says the law hangs murderers! It--it says the people got the right to make the laws! That's--that's us! And that's how we're gonna win our fight election day! And when we win it, we'll--we'll get Cass indicted! How? Lots of us ain't even got a vote. You ain't got no vote, Andy. Well, a--a lot of us have. Come November, I'm gonna have my acre paid for and a vote. Then we can elect one of our own sheriff, a common man, one of us. - Now you're talking crazy. - Who'll we get? None of us is fitting. Most of us can't hardly read. We ain't good enough. We ain't got no rights! Life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. Those are our rights, as well as theirs. It's o-our fish in the stream our... our flag on the fort. Hey! What about the tailor? - He's fitting! - Yes! - That's right. - Andy would be good. Me? Wh... No. No, I-I... I ain't fit enough. You can read and write and figure! - And you can speak. - And you can fight. How about it, Andy? You're good enough. And fit enough. - Eliza's right! - Andy for sheriff! - We can put you in! - Andy the man. We'll beat their pants off and let you sew 'em up! - Andy for sheriff! - We want him! We want Andy! He'll be the sheriff! They put me up to do the introducing, here in Greeneville, of some old friends that don't need no introducing. Now most of you younger folks didn't know this lady here when she was Miss McCardle, a-passing out books at the library. And there's her daughter, Martha. You remember her. Many of you played in the streets with her. And now she's grown-up, too, married, and has a little boy of her own. And I almost forgot. There's a man here, too. A man that got his start in politics when a bunch of us made him run for sheriff. He said he wasn't fit enough. Well, he's been fit enough to be made sheriff, assemblyman, congressman, governor, and now he comes back to his home folks in his own town as senator of the United States. No, I ain't gonna introduce him, not in Greeneville. Welcome home, Andy! Welcome home! I guess Blackstone McDaniel is right. I don't need any introducing to you. I've patched the britches of a lot of you. And your fathers' britches before you. I'm still wearing that first little dress Andy made me. Well, it's mighty fine to be home again. My friends... I have been a Jacksonian democrat all my political life. I hope we will lick the Republicans this fall and send Abe Lincoln back to splitting rails in Illinois! But people here in the South who threaten to break up this country if Lincoln is chosen president, forget that in our America, the verdict of the majority must be accepted. That is what I will say in the Senate in Washington even if Lincoln is chosen president. I repeat, that is what I will say in the Senate whether you back me up at home here in Tennessee or whether you don't! We of the South have lost the election! Very well! Mr. Lincoln will be inaugurated president in six weeks! The people have spoken! Let the will of the people be done! We can vote Mr. Lincoln out of office in four years and I hope and believe we shall do so! Meanwhile, we southerners should remain here and prevent him from carrying out policies that will ruin this country, our one country! Enough of this Yankee cackle, you renegade to the South! I repeat, our one country! Does any senator dare to challenge that? Let us keep in our hearts the immortal toast of that great democrat, Andrew Jackson. "Our federal union, it must be preserved." In the noble words of Daniel Webster, "Liberty and union, now and forever, one and inseparable." The senator has been making that same speech here day after day for the past two months. Like a parrot. What can you expect from a mudsill tailor elected by the rabble of the city among the gentlemen of the South? I'm proud of having been a tailor and I'd rather sit among the rabble than some of you self-appointed gentlemen of the South. - I demand an apology! - An apology for what? Mr. President! While the Southern senators make this place a beer garden business north and south is at a standstill! And who is to blame? Yes, who is to blame? You are! You are! Men of the North, if you force us to fight for our liberties, then we'll fight you! Don't you shake your fist at us! We're not your slaves! - Don't you yell at us! - Well, you started it! Gentlemen, this is the Senate of the United States, not a pot house! Order in the galleries! Order on the floor! Jefferson Davis. He's finally got here. It's about time. Now he can speak for all of us. For the whole South. The chair recognizes the senator from Mississippi. Mr. President of the Senate. Senators. I appear here... to announce to the Senate that Mississippi, by solemn ordinance... and in convention assembled... has declared her separation from the United States. In so doing, she has followed others of her sister states on whose behalf, as well as my own... I must pronounce our solemn farewell. Under these circumstances, of course, my functions and those of my colleagues terminate here. We but tread in the path of our fathers when we proclaim our independence and take the hazard putting our trust in God... and in our own firm hearts... and strong arms... we will vindicate the right as best we may. I see now around me some with whom I have served long. There have been points of collision. For whatever offense I have given, I ask forgiveness. Or whatever of offense that has been to me, I leave here. I carry with me no hostile remembrance. I go hence unencumbered of the remembrance of injury received... and having discharged the duty of making the only reparation in my power... for any injury offered. Mr. President, senators, having made the announcement which the occasion seemed to me to require, it remains only for my colleagues and myself... to bid you a final... adieu. Now that Tennessee has left the Union and joined the Confederacy, I denounce Andrew Johnson as a traitor to the sovereign state of Tennessee! May your black tongue rot in your throat, you liar! No man can call me a traitor! Andrew. Oh, thank you, Andrew. I was so afraid there'd be violence. From now on, there will be nothing but violence, Eliza. Nationwide violence. No, it mustn't come to that. Isn't there some peaceful way of settling it? The Southern senators walked out. They declared war. I'm going to Lincoln now and offer my services to raise troops in Tennessee and fight for the Union. - Where's the general, sir? - At his gun. Captain Brenner! - Message from General Williams? - Only verbal, sir. General Williams was in action, trying to rally the Zouaves. Trying to rally them? What's happened? Our center is broken! General Williams asks that all available reserves be sent to him immediately! There are no reserves! The rebels just sent over another white flag with a demand to surrender Nashville! You order General Williams for me to shoot any man who talks of surrender! Yes, sir. Four more years! Four more years! Boys! Boys! Close the window! Come on. Let's get on with the business. Gentlemen, not that anyone cares, of course, but we have one more tiresome formality now that we've done our duty by old Abe-- Wasn't us delegates re-nominated Lincoln by acclamation. The country done that. Sir, I'm not accustomed to being interrupted. Thad Stevens. Most of us delegates ain't congressmen and you can't treat us like you do that tame cattle of yours down in Washington. Eh, my Pennsylvania delegation and some others that I have friends in will support anyone you men decide you want. Just agree on a name. Well, there'd be no trouble if Lincoln would let us know who he wants on the ticket with him. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Well, it looks as though the White House decided to tell us something. Ah, clear out of here, you men. How do you do? - Oh, so glad to see you. - Glad to see you. The president hopes you're better, Congressman Stevens. Thank you, thank you. Afternoon, Senator Waters. Afternoon, BP. White House, Senate, House of Representatives. What we three agree on ought to go down with this mob. The president is very grateful for the plank and the platform that favors full emancipation. Well, I wrote it myself. But he wasn't so happy about that other plank you forced in. Oh, that one demands that the rebels and traitors are punished after the war. What's wrong with that? Well, he feels that it's a blow to his policy of reconciliation. Well, that's just why it's there. Come on. Let's quit playing marbles. Lincoln sent you down here to see Jim and me. What for? To discuss the vice presidency. Yeah, he wants to shove Andy Johnson down our throats. The president feels that Johnson, a democrat, will be supported by the democrats who backed the war and so will help us win the election. He says to tell you that a vice president from a rebel state will strengthen the Union. That the American people can never repay their debt of gratitude to Andrew Johnson. Oh, Johnson's a loyal man, uh... But as a southerner, he'd be bound after the war to try and stop our vengeance on the South. Mr. Lincoln does not approve of vengeance on anyone. In the interest of unity, he's anxious for a unanimous nomination, no contest on the floor. You tell the president I'll support his wartime policy until the last rebel's dead or quits. He knows you will. The president regrets that you don't agree with him on reconstruction, but he knows that you stand with him on the two important issues, victory and freedom. I fought slavery all my political life. - What's that got to do with it? - Oh, a great deal. Why, Johnson stands with you and Lincoln there. He once said in a speech, "I do not mourn over the dead body of slavery. I think we're freeing more whites than blacks in Tennessee." I wouldn't want to free a white man if he was a rebel. Well, I've said all the president asked me to say. What Lincoln wants will go down with the delegates, then. What the president wishes will go down because you and the other delegates know that the country is behind him. Good afternoon. Ah. Thad, you can't fight Lincoln on the floor here. If he wants Johnson, you better make it unanimous. That mudsill tailor. From the heart of the rebel land... next vice president of the United States. The oath of office will now be administered to the vice president-elect by the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Vice President-elect. Mr. Chief Justice. Raise your right hand, sir, and repeat after me. I do solemnly swear... I do solemnly swear... ...that I will faithfully execute the office of vice president of the United States... ...that I will faithfully execute the office of the vice president of the United States... ...and will, to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend... ...to the best of my ability, preserve... Protect, and defend... Protect, and defend... ...the Constitution of the United States, so help me God. ...the Constitution of the United States, so help me God. The President of the United States! Mr. President... senators... judges... people of the United States who are... are more-- I ask your indulgence. Drunk again. I ask your indulgence during my term of office. I, a plebeian, have studied only how best to advance the... interest of my state and country. I have... risen from the humblest walks of life to this--this... this proud position. "...with malice toward none." This is the way he wound up, Eliza. I wish you'd got to town in time to hear him. I wouldn't have heard him. I'd have been right here, looking after you in bed, where you belong. They sent me this this morning. It's a photograph of the inaugural ceremony. See, there he is, reading his speech. The people will gaze on that picture for ages to come. Where are you, Andrew? There I am, my dear, in the custody of Hannibal Hamlin. The cool air out there cleared my head. You see, I'm holding my hat over my face. Perhaps you can guess why. Now, don't you want to hear what they have to say about your husband's speech? No, Andrew, please. "After being sworn in, the new vice president indulged in an incoherent harangue, concerning which, the less said, the better, in view of the obvious condition of the man between whom and the presidency stands only one human life." Stop, Andrew. You were ill. I disgraced my president. I disgraced my country and our cause. Come in. From the White House, Mrs. Johnson. Flowers for you and a letter for Mr. Johnson. Thank you. Aren't they beautiful? I... I'm afraid to open this. Oh, you needn't be. Mr. Lincoln sees deep into all hearts and he knows yours, all wool and a yard wide. "You ornery old galoot. If only you took a drink now and then, you'd know enough about liquor not to fire yourself up with brandy on an empty stomach when you're sick. I know you only went through the ceremony for me because I asked you to. Don't worry at what they say. In hitting at you, they're hitting at me and I don't mind. We've got Lee all but whipped. You were a good tailor, Andy. And you're going to help me now, you poor, loyal cuss, to patch up the torn garment of our Union. Gratefully yours, A. Lincoln." Didn't I tell you? Three cheers for Vice President! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Evening, Mr. Johnson. I'm afraid all this noise will be disturbing Mrs. Johnson. I'm awfully sorry, but there's nothing we can do about it. That's perfectly all right. She only wishes she could get out and join in the jollification herself. She'll be up tomorrow. Sleep well, Mr. Vice President. We'll all sleep well now, the first time in four years. Oh, just a moment, please, sir. I forgot something, if you please. This gentleman called while you were out. No, I don't know the name. Probably he's just some office-seeker. - Hello, hello, dear. - Hello. Well, you should see that city out there. Oh, I can feel it even lying here in bed. It's a new Washington since Lee surrendered. New country, same crowd, same bands all over the north. People don't seem ugly or vindictive now that we've won, do they? No, this is the start of a new era of good feeling in a United States really united and for the first time. And we both know whom the country has to thank. Yes, we all know, except that little knot of his enemies down on Capitol Hill. His enemies and yours. Mm-hmm. Just listen to that noise out there, will you? We want Andy! They're calling for you, Andrew. We want Andy! We want Andy! Stop the music! Stop it! Yeah! We want to hear Andy! My friends and fellow countrymen... Hang Jeff Davis to a sour apple tree! Hang Lee, too! My friends... Never mind me. You go around the corner and serenade the president, but don't grieve him with shouts about hanging our fellow countrymen. Come on down, Andy, and have a drink, you old toper! I repeat, you should be around at the White House. Not here. We just came from there, Andy. Ain't nobody home. Abe Lincoln's gone to Ford's Theater. Few words I shall say to you, and not my own. "With malice toward none, with charity for all, let us bind up the nation's wounds." And General Grant, when he took Lee's army, there was no pride, no boasting. He just said, "Let us have peace." Now, you trust and follow Mr. Lincoln to guide us under God for four years more! Oh, splendid, Andrew. You said just the right thing. Now, you try to get some sleep. Let's hope there will be no more bands to keep you awake tonight. I will. Here, what are you reading? Poetry. "There is a lady, sweet and kind, it was never a face so pleased my mind." Oh, please don't close the doors and don't you sit up working half the night. I won't. Just a half-hour or so. Yes. Who is it? Mr. Johnson, the president's been shot. Don't go, sir. There's murder all through the city. Secretary Seward's just been stabbed at his house and we got here just in time to save you from an assassin outside your door. It's a general conspiracy. I'm going to the president. You must stay here, sir. I'm posting a guard outside. I must go, Eliza. Of course you must. Now he belongs to the ages. It is now my duty to ask when it will be convenient to administer the oath of office... Mr. President. All right, Major, take these away. And, uh... I want that report on the Freedmen's Bureau to work on tonight. Thank heavens there's nobody else waiting here to see me. Has this young lady an appointment, Major Crook? - She didn't ask for one, sir. - Mm-hmm. Here, here, wait a minute, wait a minute. Oh, Major, don't forget those two bills. We got to write a couple more veto messages after dinner. I must have seen 60 people in this room today and you're the first one didn't come in to ask me for something. Oh. Where did you get your flowers? I picked them on the lawn with Martha. She just had the children out there for a romp. How did they stand the trip from Nashville? They loved every minute of it. It'd be kind of homelike, Eliza, to have Martha and the kids living here. This place seems sort of lonesome. I don't know. Maybe it's just the job. Must be the lonesomest job in the world. Such a big place, isn't it? Glad I don't have to pay the taxes on it. And so full of ghosts. Ghosts that are hard to live up to. I bark out at people. He knew how to turn 'em down with just a funny story. The wonder of it... that you should work in his study... sit at his desk. The terror of it, to ask myself every day, every hour, "What would he have done?" And not to know. Eliza... I ain't fit. Andrew, it came to us at Milligan's forge that you were fit to be sheriff and you've grown a lot since then. You trying to tell me that I'm fit to follow him? You know better than that. To follow him who is whoever will be. The trouble with me, Eliza, I was never fit to lace up his boots, let alone stand in them. You were the man he chose, Andrew, to stand in his boots if anything should happen to him. Oh, let me. I told Martha she could bring the children in to say goodnight. Well, I must be the first president with grandchildren here. We'll let them come in every night. Grandpa, my doll! Isn't she beautiful? Oh, isn't she? Hey, Andy, Andy! Hey there, Andy! What-- Well, now, what have we got here? Major Crooks gave it to me. It's a gun to shoot bears. Well, now, we'll go out tomorrow morning right after breakfast and shoot us some bears. - Come on! Let's go now! - No! Tell me a bedtime story, Grandpa, like you always used to in Nashville when I was little. All right. Here... we go. Well, now. Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess. Oh, look! There's a great bad bear! Oh, come in, gentlemen, come in. You know my wife, my daughter, Mrs. Paterson, the children. Congressman Stevens, Senator Waters, and Congressman Hargrave. Yes, it's quite a thing to have a typical American family in the White House again, Mrs. Johnson. It's a great pleasure to welcome you to Washington, ma'am. All Washington hopes, Mrs. Johnson, for a revival of the fine, old White House traditions of before the war. Well, then I'm afraid Washington will be disappointed. Oh, we're just plain people from the hills, that's all. A brief stay in high places can't be expected to change us very much. Martha. Now, children, it's your bedtime. Grandpa hasn't told me my story yet. Well, he'll come up and tell you one in bed. - Promise? - Yes, I promise. Now, you say goodnight to the gentlemen. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. May I have a kiss, little one? Yes, if you want one. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Do you want to have a kiss, too? I couldn't think of anything more delightful, but I'm not going to submit you to any such dubious pleasure. You killed the bear! I didn't mean to. Now, children, that's enough. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Well, we've had enough homespun humor in the White House. Let's quit being whimsical and run the country. Sit down, gentlemen. You know, I've often thought if I could speak with your culture and learning, with your eloquence, Mr. Hargrave, or the power and force that you blast your opponents with, Mr. Stevens, I'd probably make a much better president. Why, Mr. President, I've never found you lacking in eloquence, sir. But unfortunately, you are as stubborn as the orneriest mule in your own Tennessee. He just plants his feet wide apart like that and you couldn't budge him with a cannon. A mule, huh? Is that why you fellas in Congress lit a fire under me? You don't act like our fire done much more than keep your belly nice and warm. Unfortunately, Mr. President, the contraption you're hitched to is the United States of America. We've gotta keep it on the move. Stevens, if you'll just state your case and let me state mine, I think we'll see better where we stand. Very good, Mr. President. I propose that we treat the South as an outside conquered people, that we confiscate all estates worth 10,000 dollars and containing 200 acres. Then, sir, I would give every adult colored man forty acres of land. Sell the rest and pay for the war with it. No use vetoing that program, Johnson. We have the votes to override your vetoes. So it comes to this. You fought a war to preserve the Union. Having preserved it, now you deny that it exists. Gentlemen, my one aim is to carry out Lincoln's policies. Try and get into your head that Lincoln's reconstruction program died with him. Oh, shut up, Waters. Let the president state his own case. Lincoln always held that the Confederate states could not secede. That they were therefore never out of the Union. Now, they stopped fighting. They took the oath of allegiance to the United States. They ratified the amendment abolishing slavery that you yourself, Stevens, piloted through congress. Ah, yes, yes, yes. It follows from Lincoln's policy that they therefore were entitled to the same rights as the rest of us. Now, gentlemen, it's just as simple as that. Well, no use making him our offer now, Stevens, after what he just said. Offer? You have some compromise to suggest? I should think it would be rather difficult to compromise our points of view. I never compromise. I came here to make a deal. To secure your cooperation with us, Mr. President. For the next eight years. Oh, I see. That's, uh, an offer to buy me... with a second term. One practical man to another, yeah. What in tarnation is that thing? What you're trying to put on my leg again and I don't like being chained up. That's why I've kept this for nearly 40 years now, just to remind me what being chained up feels like. Well, gentlemen, there's a little girl waiting for me to tell her a bedtime story, so I guess that's all. Oh, no, no. That's not all, Mr. President. That's only half. Now, wait outside, will you? I want a word alone with the president. - Goodnight, Mr. President. - Goodnight, Mr. President. Goodnight, gentlemen. Goodnight. First, Lincoln tried to block me. Now it's you. Well, that's a poor substitute, but now me. Stevens, why did you want to see me alone? To tell you that since you've turned me down, I fear I'll have to turn you out. Impeachment? You know the House would prefer charges of high crimes and misdemeanors against you anytime I say. I hope that never happens. Unfortunately, it takes a two-thirds vote of the Senate to sustain a conviction. That's the Constitution. You're a great stickler for the Constitution, aren't you? Well, you might as well know, then, we can get you out by strictly Constitutional means. Why aren't you more reasonable? And when there's no vice president, the man who succeeds an impeached president is the acting presiding officer of the Senate. Right, right. Well, they'll never put me out to put Jim Waters in. Well, that is kind of funny, at that. The Senate would never have elected him to pound that gavel if they realized that it might make him president. I have infinite faith in the people. Oh, this country isn't ruled by a plebiscite. Congress would be against you and the money power and the press. Yes, every power would be against me except the common people that Abe Lincoln said the Lord must have loved because He made so many of them. Well, go ahead, then, take the stump. Swing around the circle. Make your speeches to the people. Only you get all het-up. You don't make very good speeches. Yes, and you'd rig the press and pack my meetings. Well, we're not likely to meet socially anymore so I have to tell you that nothing would make me do what I fear I have to do, no personal or party interests, just one thing. The safety of our country which your policies would destroy. You have the impudence to sit there and tell me you're doing this to save the country? Why, you hypocrite, if you weren't a cripple, I'd pick you up and throw you through that bay window right out on the White House lawn, wheelchair and all! You know, most people think that drink is your weakness on account of that thing that happened at the inauguration. But I know better. It's temper. I've got to see Mr. Stevens at once. You can't, sir. He's sick, Mr. Secretary. - The doctor just left-- - Now, don't argue with me. Thad, he's turned me out. The tailor turned me out. You've got to do something to help me. Now, sir, Mr. Stevens is a very sick man. You can't be bothering him. I won't let you. Mr. Stevens, you've got to rest. Oh, Addie, what do they care whether I live or die, as long as I hold a job? Now, please, sir, don't say nothing about dying. There it is, Thad. Read it. Run along, Addie. If'n you get the lung fever, don't blame me. I done told you, the doctor, he say you've got to get your rest. So the tailor threw you out, huh? And after all the trouble we took to have that bill passed that he couldn't fire any of Lincoln's cabinet without the express consent of the Senate. He's violated a law passed over his own veto. That's going to cost him the presidency. I've got him just where I want him. Now, you go back and stay in your office. But I've been dismissed. You don't think I'm going to let him do a thing like that to you? Now, you go and get some troops and a couple of cannon to protect the building. Troops? Cannon? Sure. And just stay in office. - You mean, never leave it? - Leave it? No, of course not! You just stay, stay, and stay. Well, you better get a bed and some canned food because in all probability, you'll be there for three or four months. But after Johnson's out and Jim Waters is president, well, then you can go home and get all cleaned up. I'll do exactly as you say. Ah, it's amazing what privations a politician will endure just to stay in office. Here's the last report on the cabinet meeting and that's the last bit of what you call spying I'll have to do for you. You never can tell. I might want you to spy on Jim Waters when he's president. Addie! Addie! - Yes, sir? - Come here! Yes, sir, Mr. Stevens! - Order my carriage. - Tonight, in this rain? No, sir! You'll get your death of-- Order my carriage! If'n you go out in this rain and get the lung fever-- Get me my crutches! Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Who are you to tell me what I can do and what I can't do. Yes, sir. I'll do what I want. I'll die when I feel like it. The president will see you now. What's this about some amnesty idea of yours, Johnson? So your spy in my cabinet told you that, too. Well, after you broke up my meetings, I got to wondering whether I had any powers left at all, if I hadn't better resign and go back home. Oh, cut the cackle. And then I remembered a power vested in the president by the Constitution that even Congress can't touch, Stevens. Maybe you can guess what it is. A power Congress can't touch? Yes. Lincoln would've got around to that before now, but I had to wait till things settled down a bit. You wouldn't dare. That's right, you've guessed it, the pardoning power. I'm gonna sign something now and I'm glad you came over here to watch me do it. Here at this desk where Lincoln freed the slaves I now free their former masters. This proclamation pardons all and restores full citizenship to all who fought for the lost cause in the war between the states. All? Did you say all? All. - Not Jeff Davis? - Jeff Davis, too. Lee? Oh, yes, Lee, as well. Well, you're right, you have the power. Congress can't stop you. Now every rebel snake in the South will crawl out of its hidden den into the daylight. Johnson, what you've just done tonight... and what you plan to do means a new Civil War. You honestly believe that, don't you? You know I do. I haven't long to live. Just kept alive for the day of retribution and justice so I could die happy knowing I'd bequeathed the country peace. Peace? You call revenge, confiscation, and disfranchisement peace? Have you no pity for those four million injured, depressed, hopeless colored people under bondage for two centuries? I want the two races to live together peacefully, to respect one another. Your way of making slaves of the whites would put that off another century. Johnson, if you withdraw this thing... for the sake of peace, I'll quash the impeachment. So you'd drop the impeachment. Uh, yeah. Well, Stevens, I decline your offer. But I want to tell you one thing. I never really understood you until this minute. I always thought you wanted a puppet President you could boss. I called you a hypocrite. You're not. You're a very sincere man... and that's what makes you so dangerous. You have the sincerity and will and force. You have the drive of a great fanatic. You'll not rob me of all I've lived for. You'll not ruin the country with another war. I'll live long enough to stop that. My policies will go through with you out of the way. Even if I'm not here to see it. Stevens... what's the matter with you? You'd better let me get you some coffee. Huh? No. I'll crush you, Johnson. I'll save our country yet. Stevens. Stevens! Major Crooks! Mr. President. What happened? Get a doctor. Ah... Would you deny any other tailor his day in court if you were his lawyers? If I took refuge in your technicalities and cowered here in the White House while you fellows fought for me in the Senate, what could Stevens call me? Whatever he calls you, Mr. President, he mustn't spatter you with mud and filth while you sit there in person. Yes, like a man in the dock. President is more than a man. He's a symbol of the whole nation. And that's why, for the sake of the dignity of your office-- Look, you--you can't--you can't fool me! You're afraid if I went down there, Stevens and his gang would bait me in making a howling jackass of myself. That's your real reason for trying to keep me from going to my own trial. Well, I choose to face my enemies in person. I'm going to the capitol. Come along, gentlemen. - Andrew. - Wish me luck, Eliza. There's no hurry, Andrew. Why sit down there alone in the President's room fidgeting until they summon you? The President will drive to the Senate a little later. - Uh, will I have time? - Oh, yes, Mr. President. The preliminaries and the swearing-in will take another hour or so. You see? - Reserved seats. - Reserved seats. Huh. It's like walking into Ford's Theatre knowing what's going to happen. Yes, another assassination of the President. Any statement for the AP, Mr. Stevens? Well, don't quote me, but I think I got the tailor just where I want him. - But for quotation? - Quote. The days of the tyrant are numbered. Unquote. The country's greatly disturbed about your illness. Well, tell the country I'm all right. I just had a stroke, that's all. No further statement. - Thank you, Mr. Stevens. - Thank you. The honorable managers of the House of Representatives. Who's going to carry me about when you two boys are dead and gone? The President of the Senate pro tempore recognizes the spokesman for the House of Representatives. In the name of the House of Representatives and of all the people of the United States we do impeach Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, of high crimes and misdemeanors. We shall exhibit our articles of impeachment and make them good. In fulfillment of the mandate laid down in article one, section three of the Constitution, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall preside over the Senate when, as now, this body is called to sit as a high court of justice in judgment upon the President of the United States. The honorable Chief Justice! Your Honor. The chair recognizes Mr. Stevens. Mr. Chief Justice, before the 11 articles of impeachment are formally read let me state to the Senate and the country the essence of our indictment. We do not intend to cite the obvious fact that Andrew Johnson is unmindful of the dignity of his office, his disgraceful speeches of rage, if not intoxication. We will confine ourselves to the Constitution and the law. Now, in a public speech, the President of the United States suggested hanging certain elected representatives of the people, including myself. He has denied, also in a public speech, that this congress is a lawful body. He has termed us an "illegal rump" because we refuse to admit what he terms "legally elected representatives of states in the American Union," meaning unreconstructed rebels. Now, our main case, however, is based on his violation of a law passed over his veto by Congress. The Tenure of Office Act. Now, everyone in the country knows that that forbids a President to dismiss from his cabinet any member who was belonged to the cabinet of a President who died in office. Now, in so doing, Andrew Johnson, who was sworn to maintain the Constitution, created the highest possible Constitutional crime. If this is condoned, Congress will be powerless. It will be ruled over by an irresponsible tyrant. So the House of Representatives, by solemn resolution, has instructed us, its managers, to demand that the Senate, as made mandatory by the Constitution, forthwith summon and do justice upon the accused, Andrew Johnson. Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are commanded to keep silent while the Senate of the United States is sitting for the trial of the articles of impeachment. Summon the accused. Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, appear and answer the articles of impeachment exhibited against you by the House of Representatives of the United States. Andrew Johnson. Andrew Johnson. Andrew Johnson! What's this mean, Thad? Ah, Johnson isn't coming. Mr. Chief Justice, the President desires to be represented throughout this trial solely by his counsel. Mr. Chief Justice, the President has been summoned and refused to appear. This action defies the Senate, Congress, and the whole American people. We demand that he be brought before this tribunal and stand his trial like any other man accused of crime. The Constitution does not require the presence of the respondent. The chair rules that he may, at his wish, be represented by counsel. The clerk will now read the articles of impeachment exhibited against Andrew Johnson by the House of Representatives. "Article One, whereas Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, has been accused of conduct..." Well, Blackstone, it's good to see you. Andy. Come on in here now and sit down. Oh, I, uh... I wanted to, uh, wanted to thank you for calming down the folks back home. Just sit down, sit down. Well, what's on your mind, now? Things ain't so good down there, Andy. What, in Greeneville? The Senate. Ah, sitting there at my trial every day, listening to the way they kick me around kind of makes you sore, huh? It sure does, Andy. Now, Blackstone, here's the way I figure. Out of 54 votes, they need 36 to get the two-thirds for conviction. Now we only need 19 for acquittal and we know we got 16 to start with. Wish I knew where those other three were coming from. Why, from honest senators who really believe that I violated the Constitution when I got rid of that spy in my cabinet. But they'll switch when they hear the truth from the other cabinet members. You go on back there now and listen to our side. Andy... what I come up here for to tell you before anybody else did was, uh... they ain't gonna let your witnesses testify. Who won't? The Chief Justice? That's--that's not possible. He's an honest man. Oh, he ruled for you, all right, but the Senate overruled him on every point. Now, now, Andy, don't fly off the handle. Well, I expected everything but this. Accusations of drunkenness! Galleries packed with my enemies howling and yelling against me! Even that old charge in Congress that I conspired to murder Lincoln! But I never expected this! Well, I'll--I'll issue a statement to the country right now. It's too late, Andy. They're gonna start voting right soon. I should have gone down there and stood up to them in the beginning. This is no state trial. It's a criminal conspiracy! They're... they're doing this to me because I'm trying to carry out his policies. They'd be doing it to him, too, if he were alive and in my shoes! They'd be trying to destroy the-- Andrew. We could hear you shouting all over this end of the White House. People all over Washington are gonna hear me shouting! People all over this country are gonna hear me shouting! Those senators up on that hill are gonna hear me shouting! Once more I must caution the galleries to keep quiet. Mr. Chief Justice, the case for the House of Representatives and the people of the United States is concluded. After the closing speech for the defense has been made, vote will be taken upon the guilt or innocence of the President of the United States. - Mr. Chief Justice-- - The President! - The President? - The President? Mr. President, this is highly inadvisable. You should have notified us. I've been waiting a long time for this. Mr. Chief Justice, the closing speech for the defense will be made, at his own desire, by the respondent. That will be in order. He'll blow up higher than a kite and cook his own goose. Mr. Chief Justice... One of the first rules of... When the people of U-- Will the President please be seated? After repeated warnings, the chair now orders the attendants to clear the galleries. Clear the galleries! Mr. Chief Justice, I protest against your order to exclude the people from this chamber where their fate is about to be decided. Yes, there's an organized focus of disorder. The ruling of the chair must stand. I move the galleries be not cleared! I second the motion! Those in favor of overruling the chair respond by saying "Aye." - Aye! - Aye! - Aye! - Aye! - Contrary, no. - No. - No. - No. The ayes have it. The galleries will not be cleared. The Chief Justice of the United States must now decline to preside over this body while an organized clack denies respectful hearing to the President of the United States. Article one, section three of the Constitution says the Chief Justice must preside when the President is impeached. True, but I must decline to continue to do so on the grounds that it was obviously the intent of the Constitution to place the Chief Justice in the chair in order to insure a fair trial. Under the Constitution, this trial cannot proceed without the Chief Justice in the chair. Of course, a way out of the difficulty might be found if the galleries would cease these interruptions. Now that order has been restored, the President will proceed. Mr. Chief Justice. If, as has been charged, I have sometimes not been mindful enough of the dignity of my office, I am certainly mindful of it now. I kept away from my own trial... following the best advice I know of... to avoid the sort of rough-and-tumble that would heat up not only this body but the whole country to a fever point where riot and bloodshed might have swept our people. I am charged with the high crime or is it a misdemeanor? Of making speeches in a state of mingled intoxication and rage. You were drunk inauguration day! You know you were! The attendants will remove the interrupter! Please, Mr. Chief Justice, I... I want that man to hear my answer. Very well. I have a letter in my pocket. I didn't bring it down here to read to the Senate. I have it with me because I always carry it. It's my most precious possession. I shall now read a few lines from this letter as my only reference now or ever to what my... my friend in the gallery has touched upon. "You ornery old galoot, if only you took a drink now and then, you would know enough about liquor not to fire yourself up with brandy on an empty stomach when you're sick. I know you only went through the ceremony for me because I asked you to. Don't worry at what they say. In hitting at you they are hitting at me and I don't mind." This letter is dated from the White House March the fifth, 1865. I just heard that the Senate had refused to hear the evidence of my cabinet. Gentlemen, prepare to prove that my removal of a cabinet member was solely intended to test the Constitutionality of the Tenure of Office Act before the Supreme Court. So... I won't deny that I was a little hot under the collar when I left the White House. But the ride down Pennsylvania Avenue cooled me off. And I came to realize that the crime for which I am being tried here is not contained in the flimsy charges trumped up in the articles of impeachment. It appears to have been one of misunderstanding. I thought the war had ended. It seemed so, no enemy confronted us on any field. The hand of friendship was stretched out, and I clasped it. Is forgiveness a crime? My enemies think so. They're not willing to forgive. For, senators, in this crowded chamber there still stand 20 empty desks. Why are those desks empty? Where are the senators who should be sitting at them? They have been lawfully elected, but they're not here. Why? The man most responsible for the fact that we are still at war although the guns are silent... sits there at that table. I wish to say that he is a sincere man. It is his honest belief that by pardoning the Confederate leaders, I made inevitable another Civil War. He hates the South with such consuming passion that he thinks, as he has said, that it must be kept in subjugation and slavery for the next 100 years. If I am removed from office, the new President, who shares the sentiments of Mr. Stevens, will set up a junta that will be no government of United States, but a self-perpetuating, corrupt tyranny based upon bayonets, confiscation, and disfranchisement. Abraham Lincoln fought this war to restore the Union. Long ago, the fighting stopped. But while those desks remain empty, there is no Union. Senators, while we were fighting one another, a European tyrant, master of the strongest army in the world, seized our sister Republic of Mexico. If we continue a divided nation, the day will come when still stronger armies and fleets from overseas will conquer and enslave not only our central and south American brethren, but ourselves as well. As our forefathers knew, united we stand, divided we fall. Senators, the issue before you and before the whole country is not my fate as an individual. It is the issue of union or disunion and upon its solution depends, for our descendants if not ourselves, this nation's survival or its destruction. The event is in the hands of God. Order must be maintained in the galleries. The clerk will now call the roll. Mr. Albert. Mr. Senator Albert, how say you? Is the respondent, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, guilty or not guilty? Guilty. - What goes on? - It's Huyler. He's fainted. Go get a doctor! We can't do without him! Mr. Arnold. Mr. Senator Arnold, how say you? Is the respondent, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, guilty or not guilty? Not guilty. Mr. President. Andrew, Andrew. Oh, Andrew. As my husband, you've always held my love and respect, but today you really stand forth for me, the President of the United States. Well, Eliza, I'm--I'm glad to hear you say that since I'm not likely to hold this job for more than a couple of minutes longer. Well, if that should be true, nothing... nothing in your presidency has become you so much as... as your leaving it. Then this means, if you can vote Huyler-- We'll vote him. We're gonna carry him in, drag him in. - The voting's nearly over. - Come on. Man, even with Huyler, the whole thing turns on me. Just think what it means, asking me to make myself President with my own single vote, judge in my own cause. Stevens isn't asking you. He's telling you. But he agreed the dignified thing was for me to sit there and just answer "present" when they called my name. He told you that when he thought we could win without you. What will the country say if the case turns on my vote? What will history say? Mr. Senator Vincent, how say you? Is the r-- - Guilty. - Senator Vincent, is the respondent, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, guilty or not guilty? Guilty. Mr. Waters. Mr. Senator Waters, how say you? Is the respondent, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, guilty or not guilty? Guilty. Good old Jim. We're still one short. Well, Huyler can still vote if he gets here before the acquittal's announced. - He's unconscious. - Well, bring him to. - I can't-- - We mustn't lose the country by one vote. I think we're safe. - I must go and tell him. - Not so fast. The formalities will take another minute. We might still lose if they get Huyler in here to vote. Upon the roll call, 53 votes were cast and one senator did not answer to his name. Under the Constitution, the vote... Huyler just came to. They're dragging him in here. Well, hurry up, I'll keep the Chief Justice from finishing the announcement. ...necessary for conviction. Mr. Chief Justice, in the name of the House of Representatives and of the people of the United States, I protest! Senator Huyler has publicly announced he was going to vote guilty! The manager is out of order. Senator Huyler must vote. His vote is necessary to save the country. Would you throw the nation into chaos and start a new Civil War on a point of order? Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, has been adjudged guilty by 35 senators. If this outrage is consummated on this floor, guns and knives will be brought into play within the hour... on every street corner, in every city, town, and hamlet in the United States! You stand in most gross contempt, sir! Remove Mr. Stevens from the floor. Why, Senator Huyler's vote should be counted, anyhow. Everyone knows it was pledged against Johnson. A new Civil War, that's what you're starting, a new Civil War. This is the most gross miscarriage of justice in human history. If the Chief Justice pronounces those words that are even now trembling on his tongue, the only hope for the salvation of this-- Here's Huyler! - There you are, Huyler. - Good old boy. I knew we could count on you. Mr. Chief Justice, the roll call was completed. The President stands acquitted by one vote. Mr. Chief Justice, under the rules, any senator who appears on the floor before the result has been announced has the right to vote! The chair had not completed the announcement. The clerk will call Senator Huyler's name. Mr. Huyler. Mr. Senator Huyler, how say you? Is the respondent, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, guilty or not guilty? The senator need not rise. My... my vote is pledged. I say... not guilty. You're acquitted, sir. Andrew! Andrew! Thirty-five to 19. Senator Huyler's vote. - Andy! - Mr. President. - Andy. - One vote! Mr. President, congratulations! - Thirty-five to 19! - Huyler decided it. You should have seen Thad Stevens' face! On behalf of President Grant, of the Senate, and of the entire nation, the chair extends welcome to the new senator elect. Before the gentleman from Tennessee is escorted to the bar to take the oath of office, the Senate would welcome a few remarks from the only former President to be elected a member of this body after he left the White House. Mr. President. Senators. My... my fellow Americans. When I last occupied this... this seat in 1861, I was surrounded by empty desks. Now I... I see that they are no longer vacant. Virginia and the Carolinas, Alabama, Louisiana, and... Texas, Mississippi, Florida, Arkansas, and Georgia. You are all back in the fold... as Tennessee stands here in your midst. I... I see as I greet you who sit here about me... that what Lincoln fought for... lived for, and... and died for at long last, has come to pass. The union of these states. One and inseparable. Now and forever.
