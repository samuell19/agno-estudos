MPD Tech-Ops to Metropolis City Hall. 2078W in progress. Kidnapping with advanced weapons. Got to be Intergang. They took out half the reserve with their tech weapons last week. Makes you nostalgic for assault rifles. It's a laugh to chose the plaza, Maggie. These assholes are expecting something to wreck, Dan. Probably with a cape. Lucky me, I know a back way. Get Mr. Mayor and his better half out of here before we get in trouble from the man upstairs. Didn't know you was a believer, boss. That ain't the man upstairs I'm talking about. Step away from the Mayor, Mannheim. Don't give me a reason. Then you shouldn't have given me one. You, make sure they're dead. Painfully sure. And you, grab our esteemed Mayor while I call for a ride. Okay. I'll get you out of here. Come on, fella. You don't want to be a cop killer. Yeah, why's that? Huh? Hey, ever wonder what it feels like to fall from a great distance? Let's find out. Oh, looks like it hurts. Be right back. Work, damn it! Stupid piece of crap! You're supposed to transport me on my command. Don't bother. Fried it with my heat vision. Only place you're being transported to, Mannheim, it's got three squares a day, and lights out at 8:00. Son of a... You know, if there's one thing I can't stand, it's a bully. Guys like you give Metropolis a bad name. But you should know by now, Mannheim, no one tears my city apart and gets away with it. I feel like I say this a couple of times a week but thanks, Superman. I don't know what we'd do without you. You sound like a guy who wants my vote, Mr. Mayor. Hey, hey. That's my friend there. Superman! Hey, it's me, your old buddy. Bibbo Bibbowski. How is the unluckiest sailor in town? Ah, come on. You ain't have to save my bacon that many times! Anyway, ain't no sailor no more. I'm a restaurateur. Ace O' Clubs Bar and Grill. How about a picture for the joint? Yeah. Stupid thing. Never works when you need it to. I got you covered. Jimmy Olsen, you're a lifesaver. Say Superman! Superman! Thanks, big guy. I'll make sure to get this to you, Mr. Bibbowski. See you down at the joint, kid. The ribs are on me. Thanks, Jimmy. I really have to get going. Leaguers, is anyone... - Available? - 'Sup? I have to be somewhere. Think you could help with the cleanup? Oh, again? I swear you guys think I'm some sort of one-man janitorial crew. Well, while you're at it, my apartment could use a going over. Whoa! What the hell have you been up against? An Intergang crew that somehow got a hold of a Mother Box. And that's not all. This armor's from Apokolips, too. How you figure? I'm wearing the same stuff, remember? Oh, great. Leftovers from our war with Darkseid. We need to get this analyzed. Maybe one of the others could help. No, we need someone who's worked with this crap. Someone who knows it inside and out. We need my dad. I could take it to him if you want. I know you two don't exactly... Nah, it's cool. No problem ever got better by avoiding it. Well, at least, I won't be slowing you down on cleanup. - Later, partner. - I owe you one, Flash. You owe me about 30. I wonder if it's too late to join the Titans. Is there an age limit? He's gonna take pictures with anyone who asks. The guy just can't help himself. You said two minutes, tops. Sorry, Miss Lane, tech-enhanced gangsters kidnapping the Mayor and other assorted distractions. I know. I saw it live. Are you sure you're not just getting old? You'll have to tell me what that's like. Ha! Super touche. Your stories about Superman helped me earn the people's trust. Now it's time they learned about the Kryptonian tech that brought the strange visitor from another planet to Earth. And here's the compartment that contained me as an infant. Throughout the trip, it was in charge of monitoring my genetic makeup as well as my basic metabolism. Not to mention midnight feedings. How did it do all this? I've only gotten so far studying Kryptonian technology. That's why I handed the job over to Dr. Klyburn and her crew. Which we were more than happy to take on. Only recently have we discovered these super condensed ionized crystals. We believe they acted as hyperwave acceleration units for transport. Oh, the gas. To put it simply. We pulled it from the main section of the pod, the baby's car seat, so to speak. It can only be activated one way. You might want to look away for a moment, Miss Lane. Kryptonian tech can be a bit overwhelming. Holy... Your identity genome is confirmed, Kal-El. I am the data matrix, the physical embodiment of a personally attuned program designed as a repository for all that is Kryptonian in nature. My sole purpose on this journey is to inform you, assist you and protect you and all Kryptonian life. - During... - Wait a second. Is he... Yes, Miss Lane. You're looking at the last son of Krypton's nanny. Keep watching. As I have also been entrusted with preserving the history of all Kryptonian bloodlines. We will begin with yours. - The House of El. - Wait, is that... There's your headline, Miss Lane. I'll like you and the rest of the world to meet my parents. So, what do you think? I don't know what to say. It's... Hey, Superman, looking good. It's gonna be a reminder of just how alien you are. People forget that when you're saving them from falling airplanes. True, but I have faith that... Hey, you rock, Superman! Thanks. You do... too. There's a really smart woman I know who always says daylight is the best disinfectant. Lift back to the Planet? And save me from expensing cab fare to Perry White? You are heroic. You know me, always saving the day. Thanks for the ride. I gotta go. - There he is! - Hey Superman, can I get a selfie? Me too. - You're in a rush. - Got a big story. I don't want to spoil your day but you're looking at the guy with an exclusive on Intergang. Well, that's nice. Come with me. What's bigger than Intergang? You'll find out. No, right. You had that interview with your super friend. I know what that means. In here. You're always on fire after seeing him. Should I be jealous? I think it's the tights. I can pick up a pair if that's all it takes. Perfect. Wear 'em on our trip to the Hamptons this weekend. Uh, about that... Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. Do you know how hard it is for me to get away? I gave up that interview with the Secretary of State! - I can explain. - Really? You mean it's not some secret meeting with some secret spies in some secret location? My parents are in town. Serious? So, you buried the lede? This weekend just got a whole lot more interesting. Um... I don't... You don't what? Want me to meet them? Don't you think it's time? Lois, wait. It's just that... Look, Clark, I'm not gonna waste time worrying if a guy likes me or not. We're both adults. I know it was my idea to keep things secret at work, but I'm really trying here. No. No, you're right. You should meet them. It's just that this is uncharted territory for me and there's some things I need to get used to sharing. Clark, it's your parents. What am I gonna find out? That you were a huge dork? I already know that. It'll be fine. Just fine. Well, Dr. Stone, what's the verdict? It matches what we've seen from other Apokoliptian tech, but not completely. John, can you come here for a moment? I can't remember the last time you asked for help. Dr. Irons is one of S.T.A.R. Labs premier engineers. If it's about this metal, Silas, I've been... Oh. That's him. - Have we met? - At a construction site, once. I had just quit LexCorp and wanted to get my mind off it. I remember. Nice shirt. I wear it with pride. Oh, can we just do this already? What'd you find, John? It's definitely from Apokolips. But it's been bonded with Earth-based tri-formulite at an atomic level. The combination makes this stronger. Incredible! That means it's even stronger than you, Victor. Always got an encouraging word, huh, Dad? You'd need some very sophisticated resources to produce an alloy like this. The S.T.A.R. Labs could do it, but it sure didn't come from here. Maybe Wayne Tech. Or even... Of course. Cyborg, we'll catch up later. Thank you both for your time and expertise. You're welcome, Superman. I appreciate you bringing me in on this, son. It's been a long time. Yeah, I know. Sorry about that. Dr. Irons, you good? Better than ever, Victor. Lose something, Lex? I'm sorry. What are we blaming me for now, Superman? Those weapons this morning. They're based on alien technology, but clearly modified for Intergang here on Earth. Ooh, that sounds scary. But as you can see, I spend my days under house arrest, wearing this crude leash. I've added a little dash of Kryptonite green. Don't worry, it's not real. Oh, come on. Intergang has connections all over the planet. It could be anyone. We'll get to the bottom of it, Lex. And when we do, I'll be back. You know something I don't know? Only that this city's never going to love you just for hating me. But Senator, the rents on those slums were raised 200%. As the newly disclosed owner, you must have some kind of a comment. - I guess not. - Incoming. I heard something juicy and I had to share. Doesn't Daily Planet Live go on the air in two minutes? Mmm-mmm. I'm not on until the second segment. I'm sure it could wait. So you're meeting the parents? Oh, God, make it stop. Lois, you're great. I respect you. I wanted to be you until I found out on camera there's more than digging through government garbage. - Who told you anyway? - You did, just now. I had a suspicion something was up when you stopped calling him "Smallville." I did? Sweetie, the women here notice everything about tall, handsome men. And the only competition in this place is Steve Lombard, and he makes me feel like I need a shower. Hello ladies, did someone mention the Stevenator? Yes, I think it was human resources. You see my point. Hey! Listen, Cat, Clark and I are just good friends right now. You wanna spread it around the office? Have at it. - Just let me get back to work, okay? - Okay, okay. Just be careful. You always said Clark seemed different, like he's got a wall around him. It's like he doesn't want anyone to get too close, you know what I mean? Yeah, I guess I do. We need you on set, Miss Grant. That's my cue. See ya. Dropped something? As your long-suffering, devoted wife, I'm used to your butter fingers at home but, Hank, you're setting a bad example for the others. Yeah, Commander, I'm starting to wonder if we got the wrong Henshaw in charge. Guys, I'm happy to let Terri call the shots, but I got to warn you, I'm considered the nice Henshaw. Yeah, right. Terri, give Houston a call. Looks like they were right about the hydraulic struts. The launch vibration probably knocked some screws loose. Knocked some screws loose. Very technical. Well, I'm sure you can science that up a bit, Madam Engineer. Houston, this is Excalibur. Come in, Houston. Come on, Space Rangers. Last looks before we head back in. It's your ninth trip up here, boss. You can't still be dazzled. I'm just looking for a red cape. You can see it if he's above the exosphere. He's been up here twice, you know. Saved my ass, one time. Yes, sir. You can always count on Superman. I hated to interrupt your plans. How was your night in the town, Mr. Luthor? Phenomenal, Gregory. But then again, every private performance by the Bolshoi is a little better when it's forbidden. Do you have something for me? Uh... Right. Sometimes I forget which one of us the government's placed under house arrest. I don't. Hank? They need you back online. Important. Henshaw here. What's up? Oh, hell! We've got unidentified debris heading our way. Everyone, back to the ship. Now! Leave it! Always happy to walk among the greatest minds of this generation. That's why I bought them. That specimen's clearly porphyritic rock. Read a book, you clod. At last, someone understands Euclid's fifth postulate. Too bad it's not you. I do not suffer fools, people. The world is filled with too many already, obsequious cretins who worship aliens, believing them to be the agents of justice. But I have seen the alien's true face. I understand his threat. In spite of my false conviction at the hands of these vigilantes, LexCorp has stayed on mission, redoubling its efforts to find the next alien Ubermensch and crush it in its infancy. - Now, show me what you've found. - Okay. They hacked into Houston's encrypted feed from the Excalibur shuttle, and something's heading our way. We've got 30 seconds. You need to fire engines now! I'd like to see what they're running away from. Do we have a satellite nearby? Enlarge. Does that asteroid look unusual to you? - It looks lumpy. - Hmm. I was going to say pregnant. Tether's still attached, Bay door's open. 12 degrees. I don't care. Initiate primary thrusters now! Captain, impact! We're breaking up! We lost starboard thrusters and... Oh, my God, Hank, we're not gonna make it. - What do you say, Captain? - Like hell, we're not! Superman will save us, just like always. We're breaking up! Stay calm, everyone. He's on his way. I know it. - Lose some thrusters. Out of control... - Hey, what are you... It's okay, Terri. You can always count on Superman. Terri, no! Superman, I knew you'd come. Mr. Luthor? I have to hurry before I'm missed. The meteorite's impact was in the mid-Atlantic channel, coordinates 4712 North, 74595 West. Did you get that? You son's anti-toxin will be delivered within the hour. Congratulations on his survival. Time to go for a swim. Clark, flank me! Seriously, Diana. We need to use code names in the field. You just called me Diana. But that's what you want to be called. You want to be called Superman? Sounds like even your ego is super strong. I just don't need my real name public. Besides... I like Superman. Because Wonder Man sounds like we're married? No. Because she gave it to me. You mean Lois? Yeah, Lois. Funny how you use her actual name, but don't allow her to know yours. It's a complicated relationship. Kind of like ours was. It was nice for a while. Yes, it was. It's just as well. I wasn't very good at playing this masquerade of yours. Towel? I don't sweat. Maybe not on the outside. Guys, Lennon finally made it. We're all in the meeting room. Descending down, past 9,000 meters. 2,500 meters. I hear something off the port side. I'm paying you for your experience, Hazelwood. Be skittish on your own time. We're already at 10,000 meters, Mr. Luthor. Dive deeper. I wanna find that meteorite. Uh, Mr. Luthor, there's someone out there. Those are Atlanteans, you idiot. Aquaman's tribe. Hold on, Lex. I'm picking up something. I suppose you want us to find out where that's coming from. You suppose correctly. They stopped. Something just grabbed them! I can't get a visual. It sounds like they're being torn apart! Mr. Luthor, are you still there? We've better get out of here! We gotta... We gotta... What the hell? He's gone. Go back. I want to see that thing again. Amazing. A creature who's traveled light years through space and survived a catastrophic entry to Earth. The Blue Boy Scout could have some competition. Okay, next up, the operating budget for the upcoming fiscal year. Utilities are above what the UN cleared for funding, guys. I'll handle it. Move on, Cyborg. Wonder Woman merchandise did very well this year. I can step up when the Wayne Foundation falls short. You're kidding, right? Okay, okay. Let's just agree we have this covered. What else? Just the Excalibur incident. Only three bodies recovered. I've got my guards investigating the impact area. S.T.A.R. Labs wanted some rock samples. All right. Well, if that's it, we'll meet next Thursday. Same Bat time, same Bat channel. - I won't be here. - Why? Yeah, if I can be here, you can be here. Dude, it takes you all of three seconds to get here and back. Two at most, but point taken. I have a meeting with the headmaster at Damian's boarding school. No way! Batman has a parent-teacher conference? That's great. Are you in the PTA too? Tell me you're in the PTA. I'm Batman. We need more chaperones for homecoming. Who has to be convinced to sign up? I'm just joking. I think that's great. Is he still glaring at me? Hmm. We could just push the meeting back to that evening. Ah, can't. I've got rehearsal dinner that night. Is he in a play? He's getting married. Somehow. Yup, married the next day. Limos, banquet hall, DJ, the whole shebang. Just immediate family, you understand? Does Iris know? She better, she picked the date. No, I mean, does she know about you? Are you kidding? I told her ages ago. Oh, geez, Supes. You can't drop a bomb like that on a honeymoon. - Aren't you worried? - About what? About bringing her into your world? The dangers, the sacrifice... Clark, that's what marriage is all about. This calls for a toast. We've got some beer in the fridge. I know. Milk for you. Congratulations. Where you going? Fiji, Bora Bora, SeaWorld? Okay, Flash, there are times when speed is not good. So next thing I know, he's climbed on top of that bull. It couldn't throw off my little Clark though. The kid was a daredevil. This Clark? The guy who irons his socks? Dad, come on! TMI. - What's that mean? - Too much information, Jonathan. I'm sure Lois has heard half these stories before. Not really. Not at all. That's because if my folks have taught me one thing, it's not to talk about myself. That's a parent's job. Mission accomplished. Sounds like there's a lot I don't know. Warn me now, if I should keep my distance. Well, you wouldn't be the first young lady to break his heart. TMI, Ma! Oh, now, we're getting to the good stuff. Well, first there was Lana, lovely girl, lived next door. She'd come over every once in a while, not... not like Pete Ross. I mean, he was there every day. I always wondered about that boy. Well, then there was the girl on the swim team. Laurel, Laura... um... Lori. Lori Lemaris. I remember her. She was quite a catch. - Pa! - Clark's right. Maybe we shouldn't talk about her. I am serving halibut. Come on. Taxi! Here it comes. And there it goes. You okay? You couldn't wait to get me out of there, could you? Well, that's not true. I didn't want you to be bored by all those stories. Bored? Clark, this is the first time I think I've ever learned anything about you. To be honest, it drove home how much distance you keep between us. Lois, you know me better than anyone. Then that's a real shame. Nothing is more important to me than you. I just have trouble showing it. There's something else going on, and sometimes I feel like it scares you that I might get to the truth. Taxi! On second thought, I think I'm gonna walk. I think I'm at the spot where the killer emerged. I don't see any sign of him. I need to get back to the others. I've got the coordinates. I'll let everyone know. Sorry for your loss, man. I'm sorry. I guess we talked too much tonight, didn't we? You were fine, Ma. We're getting old. The secrets, uh... They don't seem as important as they used to. They served a purpose. Still do. She's a nice girl, Clark. You deserve someone special. The problem is, the more special they are, the more you want to protect them. I know. But you should have choices like anyone else. We raised you so that you could be yourself. We didn't raise you to be alone, honey. I've never been alone. Not since the day you and Pa took me in. Brian? Cat, please. At least let me have my coffee first. Abracadabra. Here, caffeine, ingest and go. There's nothing to say. That's never true. Isn't there a Wayne or a Kardashian you could be chasing? You, Kent, the Kansas crew. Was he all nervous and shaky like he gets? I gotta start taking the stairs. Well, you know, he got here early. - Clark? - Yup. And he keeps finding reasons to walk by your desk. Cat, seriously, can you lay off? Things didn't go quite as expected. Having you press buttons is really not helping anything. Lois! I stopped and got you some... coffee. Should I leave? No, Cat. I was just looking for a background on a Congressman Lois interviewed last year. Maybe we can meet for lunch. We need to talk. Okay. I can eat around 2:00 p.m. That'd be great. Whatever works for you, works for me. There's a place in Hob's Bay. Get the address from Jimmy and I'll meet you there. Wow! - So, what do you think? - It's hard to say. He's nervous, that's for sure. It could be nothing. You know how men are, you never know. Hmm. Yeah, you're in trouble. I'm sorry. Don't order a lot for lunch. You don't wanna be bloated when, mmm... I got the alert. What's up? Just wanted you to know there's action in your zone. - Where? - I think we're okay for now. Flash and a few others are already headed out. Initial reports are some kind of creature. Arthur spotted something off shore, might be related. I've got a lunch with Lois but I'll cancel. We're good with who we have. This lunch wouldn't have anything to do with what we were discussing the other day? Call if the League needs me. Is that your way of saying, "Mind your own business?" Yup. It killed him. It killed him! Oh, my God! Goodness! If anyone's watching this, send help. This monster's killing everyone! Oh, no! No! It's okay, kid. We're here now. Flash, civilians! Hawk's still alive. Lantern? We need a perimeter. Like hell! This is no time for a rope-a-dope. I'm a member of the Green Lantern Corps. We eat monsters like this for breakfast. Okay, I didn't see that coming. Alert. Three leaders down and we only just got here. Need backup, now. Dabney Donovan, how's my hard-earned money being spent? Lex, why it's all in front of you. Every penny. I'll stay here. I don't do crazy very well. - Still carrying the gun? - Oh yes. You never know when one of my babies might break out. They get... confused. Any progress? Hit or miss, I expect to have more obedient samples soon. Very soon. I don't want samples. I want an army. It's difficult replicating DNA. We need a more durable code. Now, that creature you told me about... We're tracking it down, Dabney. Don't count your chickens. What about this one? This was to be the prototype. - It's still growing. - Lex! We found it. Fall, you bastard! And then I says to Superman, I says, "Hit him with an uppercut. Now counterpunch, counterpunch!" And that's pretty much how I helped him save the city, more or less. That's quite a story. - I got a hundred of 'em. - I'll bet you do. How about menus, do you have any of those? Oh yeah. Here you go. Try the ribs. It comes with super sauce and a side of super slaw. Um, super! I'm sorry. Jimmy loves this place. Jimmy Olsen eats chili dogs for breakfast. So, what did you want to talk about? Okay. The other day you said it felt like I was holding back, like something was wrong. You were right. Okay. Glad to know I'm not crazy. Well, this doesn't have to be a bad break-up. I'm still gonna come to work each day. If that's a problem, it's on you to deal with. I... Wait, let me finish. There's a reason why I'm so secretive. And I think you deserve to know why. And? I'm Superman. That's... That's good, Clark. You got me. Look at me. Oh, my God! This is insane. But it makes total sense. You... You always showed up around the same time. It was like you were just there. And you were good, too good. Oh, my God, this is so unethical. You wrote stories about yourself. Well, yeah, but only a couple of times. I really wanted the job. You never take vacations, you never sweat, you never tan... Are those people even your parents? They are, but you know, it's complicated. Oh, my God! You're from another planet! My boyfriend's from another planet. Listen, Lois, I'm just a guy from a small town who wants to do the right thing. But doing what I do could put my family in danger. I did this so that they wouldn't have to pay for my choices. And now you want me to live with it, too. I hope you can, because there's something else I've been keeping secret. You want to get that? Jimmy, I'm busy. Call back... What? What? Speak up, I can't hear you. Chief wants you on the chopper. I'll be right there! - What, why? - A monster's heading towards Metropolis. He's already taken out half the Justice League. Well, I guess you must have heard... ...that. Can you tell what he's thinking? No real thoughts. It's all aggression, all about the fight. Killing machine. No! Batman, heads up! Not looking too good, Cyborg. We can take this creep. Come on! Let's... Where is that monstrosity? South. Heading towards Metropolis. We need you, Clark. I call you out, monster! I compel you to surrender! You may resist the lasso, mindless creature. But by Hera, you will fall! Diana? I should have gotten here sooner. Not your fault. You wait here, okay? Wait. Take him down, Clark. Don't hold back. Or he'll kill everyone. I don't know what hole you crawled out of or where you came from, but I'm sending you back. This creature has not been identified by the government and is rumored to have left members of the Justice League wounded or near death in Carlon Heights. Hey, if you ain't gotta place to go, you can stay with me while Superman cleans this clown's clock. I'll be here for you. Just like my buddy Supes is always there for us. Question is, will Superman once again meet the challenge and keep this... Doomsday out of Metropolis? You heard her, people, Lois has given this thing a name. Doomsday. Let's get on it. We need a new Page One. Yeah, if there's anyone left to read it. Superman may be the only hope Metropolis has. In the past, that's always been enough. Oh, please, cry me a river. Fascinating. What kind of civilization would produce that? It seems its only function is destruction. Perhaps it's a weapon. A first strike meant to wipe out all life on a planet for a conquering force. That would explain why it's come to Metropolis. It's drawn to population centers. Who, besides me, would send an apex predator here to kill the strongest thing it could find? You think it might kill Superman? It would save me a lot of trouble. But what if the caped wonder can't bring him down? Metropolis will still need to be protected. Luckily, it's a day I've been planning for a long time. The United States metahuman advisory department is recommending all civilians head to safety zones. Get out of the car, get out of the car! Come on! Get out of here! Joey, no! Somebody, help my child! Get back to your mom, son. Everything's going to be okay. Oh, man! Superman's not looking good. Huh? I've got you. You've got me? But who's got you? We need to call in the cavalry. I am the cavalry. You can't go back after that thing. It's suicide! So was following in a chopper. I have to get back to work. Come on, Jimmy. At this point, it's impossible to tell who's the victor. Though Superman has come from behind before... Lane, Olsen, keep the camera rolling. You'll wanna get this. You think taking down the Justice League is supposed to scare us? That happens once a week. I don't know where you've come from, you alien scum. But you've picked the wrong city. And the wrong human. Metropolis is, and always has been, under the protection of Lex Luthor, you son of a bitch! Now to get a piece of you. Step back, you freak of nature! No! Stay away from me. I'm Lex Luthor! I'm supposed to win. No! I'm supposed to win. No! Clark? I got your note. And I love you, too. No! Stay with me. Please, stay with me. That thing... is he? Yes. You did it. You saved everyone. Good. It's all I ever wanted. Except for you. What a lucky man I was. No! No, no, no! Superman was an example that inspired us to reach beyond ourselves, to soar towards a better tomorrow. He was a hero to Metropolis but more importantly, he was a friend. Really, sorry, sir. I need you to step back a bit. His powers were truly amazing. Is she gonna be okay? Yes, Officer. It's just a big loss for everyone. Yeah, Superman was kinda like family, wasn't he? Of course, he didn't act alone. The Justice League also put their lives on the line against this brutal, incomprehensible evil. In many ways, I'm sure they feel the loss of their leader and comrade, most of all. And let us not forget the quick action from Lex Luthor, who allowed Superman the time he needed to save us all. Ladies and Gentlemen, Lex Luthor. Thank you, Mayor Booker. It's no secret Superman and I had our differences, but this wasn't always the case. You would be surprised all the times he came to visit. The wisdom he would impart. I will miss those late night chats on my balcony. For Superman, always in our hearts. Hail Mary, full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed are thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Why would you let Superman die when a washed up old roughneck like me goes on living? It ain't right, God. It just ain't right. I don't understand your hesitation, Dr. Klyburn. If S.T.A.R. Lab's research on the alien corpse is complete, Project Cadmus is perfectly suited to house it until it's ready for disposal. It's fine here. LexCorp just needs to get the payload rocket ready so the government can get this creature off planet before it lands in the wrong hands. You know I've been exonerated, yes? You and your S.T.A.R. bureaucrats can't keep trying me for crimes I've been cleared of. You may have been cleared, Luthor, but no one thinks you're innocent. As far as I'm concerned, Cadmus is a genetic pirate ship posing as research... Someone track it. Where's it going? Up, up and away. No one's touched a thing. I know. I just wanted to... check in on him. You know, there's still a lot of people missing after the battle. They're being found every day. Clark will show up. He's got the best reason of all to return. Thanks, Cat. - Louis! Good you're still here. - Yeah. What's going on? Police scanners. Come on! Jim, I'm in no mood to chase a story right now. You will be. Trust me! You drive. - Is it true? - You tell me. Oh, my God! Superman? In the wake of our tragic loss, as crime rates rise across the country and social unrest is at an all-time high, we seem to be a nation that has lost all hope. It's been six months since Doomsday, and the world is still shaken by the death of Kal-El of Krypton... better known to us as Superman. My guest is commentator, G. Gordon Godfrey. Sir, you've written an editorial in which you call on us to reject so-called "Supers," and effectively become our own heroes. We have an infestation, Cat. It's out of control. You're writing about the mysterious new Supermen. Oh, Eric! Look, Cat, the reality is, these are "Supermen" we know nothing about. But they're actually making a difference. Did they make a difference to the Excalibur Shuttle crew? We already have difference-makers. - The police... - The Justice League, the Titans. But, Cat, the point of my editorial is to say that it's time for human beings to stop relying on Leagues and Titans, and start saving ourselves. So, we should each be our own Superman? I mean, isn't that exactly what these guys are doing? Get a message to Mannheim. Tell him, Snakey Doyle's got the business in-hand. We'll see him in five to ten. Stop fooling yourself, Cat. The "Man of Steel" is dead. We saw the body. Before it vanished. Look, we have no idea if a Kryptonian can even die. I mean, where's the body? Who cares? The real questions here are far more pressing. Who are these new guys? Why are they here? What is their place in a world without a Superman? Reign of the Supermen. I hate it! Buck up, Troupe. Writing's fine, just a crap headline. We'll fix it later. Now, I want angles! Sullivan? Law enforcement angle. Crime stats. "Have the Supermen made us safer?" I love it. Change "Law enforcement" to "Millennials" and "Crime stats" to "Re-tweets." Are the Supermen trending? Troupe? I was gonna go cover the LexCorp charity gala tonight. Wrong. You're covering the big launch of the Justice League's Watchtower. Have the new Supermen been invited? Lombard? Uh, I... I don't really think there's a sports angle here. I love it! Kent? I meant the Kent angle. "Missing persons following the Doomsday attack. The search for survivors." I think Lois is covering it, Chief. Don't call me "Chief." Lane, what have you got? Great Caesar's ghost! Where the hell's Lois Lane? It's okay, Lois. We've got you. Jimmy packed up his desk. He has a box, but I haven't been to the Planet since... When I'm there, it just reminds me he isn't. I should've called. I wanted to. I'm just glad he finally fessed up. It was such a big secret to keep from you. I loved him too. - I tried to tell him, but... - Oh, honey... He knew. I just... I can't believe he's gone. He might not be if you watch that damn Grant woman. Jonathan! Clark's body disappears, and suddenly these new Supermen show up out of the blue. What if one of them really is Clark, reborn? Not possible. I would know. Of course. I just mean... There are a lot of unanswered questions. When Superman first showed up in Metropolis, nobody knew what to make of him, because nobody knew what to ask him. I knew what to ask him. I know what to ask these guys! I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'm glad you called. I'm glad you came. I was hoping you could help me. - I'm following... - I never thought of us as rivals, you know. Are we? Kal-El and I had a special bond, but you were the love of Clark Kent's life. Anyway, I'm relieved he finally told you everything. Apparently he didn't. I'm sorry. For an Amazon, I have surprisingly few girl friends here. So, I'm bad at this. It's okay. I don't have many girl friends either. Anyway, the reason I called is that I'm following the story on the new Supermen and I was hoping that you or the League might have some inside information on these guys. Anonymous, deep background, just to help me direct my efforts. So, you didn't invite me here to grieve with you? As friends? Not really, no. Thank Hera! Despite my reputation, I'm not good at being touchy-feely. Lois, I don't have anything for you on the Supermen. I wish I did. Off the record, the League's been stretched very thin since we lost Kal. I don't think the world realized how much they depended on him. I know the feeling. No. I'm sorry, Lois. - I didn't... - That's fine. Really. It feels good to talk to someone who understands. I'm sorry to bother you about the new Supermen. Forget I asked. Just between us, I like the brutal one with the visor. But apparently I have a type. Anything else I can get for you lovely ladies? Ice cream. Hmm. Maybe you're not so bad at the girl friend thing after all. And you, Lois Lane, have the heart of an Amazon. So, you wanna share a ride? Thanks, I've kinda got my own. Would you mind? We should do this again sometime. Lois, I know in order to heal, you need to solve the mystery of these Supermen. Just make sure you don't lose yourself in the process. Something wrong? No. Everything's on schedule. He's just a little... handsy for me. He must get that from you, Donovan. Lois Lane? John Henry Irons. You interviewed me once. Uh, Dr. Irons! Right. I'm sorry, would you excuse me? And there's my cue. Ladies and gentlemen, once again, I want to thank you all for giving so generously. Together, we will rebuild our great city, and ensure that we never wake to another Doomsday. You've seen him in the news, but you didn't know who was bankrolling him until now. Ladies and gents, I give you LexCorp's new Superman! Hello, ladies! If you want a hero who can measure up, - I can... - And I promise you that as long as LexCorp exists, Superman lives. Metropolis will be protected. Um, party's back that way. Oh, hello! Hello. I was looking for someone. Mr. Donovan. Not here. You look... familiar. You don't look so bad yourself. Do you work down here? What do you do? Advanced genetics. Fragmenting and manipulating DNA for molecular duplication and, ah, reproduction. Ooh! Sounds important. You don't think a sophisticated clone like LexCorp's new Superman out there, just happens on its own. Clone? That's right. Mr. Luthor. - I was just... - Mouthing off. Again. Word of advice, Donovan. A man who can't keep secrets shouldn't sleep around on his wife. Lex, I swear, I didn't. Of course, you did. And I'll deal with you later. Get out. Ms. Lane, I'm hurt. I always assumed once Superman was out of the picture, you'd rebound with me. What the hell? What do you think you're doing? At this moment, I am answering a question posed by Lex Luthor. Okay. Well, here's another one. Why the hell are you here? Lex Luthor is a known criminal. Criminals must be eradicated. - Thank you. - For what? Get down! Why, Ms. Lane, you do care. Call off your clones, Lex! Only the boy is mine. Sorry, pal. Crash my party, you get bounced. You have been classified a priority one criminal accessory. Surrender or be eradicated. Well, you've been classified a priority one dirt-bag, so, there! Yeah! You better run! Jerk! Uh-oh. Hey! I had that guy. By all means, go to town, Superboy. It's Superman. Okay, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. Surrender Luthor over to Superman and this ends. That's enough. We may see it differently, but in the eyes of the law Lex Luthor is not a criminal. The rule of law is a rule you never break. And real justice is everyone's right. Even the worst among us. Now, who the hell are you? I'm Superman. There is only one Superman. Oh! No problemo. Just doin' my job. Like the boss says, as long as LexCorp exists, Superman lives. And I'm Superman. Me. There he is! Over there. - Over there! Over there! - That's him! Why are you here? Nice work in there. Thank you. He got away. Yeah, so did we. What happened to the man in steel? He took off. Lois Lane. Daily Planet. So, how old are you? Excuse me? How old are you? Old enough. Okay, babe. Hit me up. That was revolting. So do you mind telling me what the heck you were doing in that lab? I used to work there. I suspect Lex has been using tech I developed to retrofit weapons for the black market. What the heck were you doing with Donovan? Finding out that Superboy is a clone. So why did you hide the fact that your new Superman is actually a clone? I never said he wasn't a clone. I said he's Superman. And he is a Superman clone. Now, if you'll excuse me. Do we wake him? No. Kal-El's last battle left him severely depleted. We must not interrupt his ion radiation transfer. Lane's not explicitly calling them fakes. She's asking the questions that need to be asked. After her stunning LexCorp clone expose, she's got our attention. Hello, Ms. Lane. I guess you got my message? The whole city did. I feel terrible we haven't been able to talk yet. On the record? But I thought you'd be happy to see me. See who? I don't know who you are. Lois, it's me! You look like Superman, but Superman died. In my arms. I did. For my people, death doesn't have to be the end. Our technology was... is... far beyond what exists on Earth today. Part of that technology is encoded in my genome. Before I died, I was able to activate it so that it could rebuild and revive me. As a robot? I'm not a robot. These are just artificial replacement parts. A cyborg Superman? Just Superman. Okay. What was your last secret? I don't know. Half my memories are gone along with the rest of me. Then tell me what you do remember. I remember we were close. How close? Enough that it hurts to have you look at me like I'm a monster. The way you wrote about me... I never dreamed I'd lose you like this. Especially not now when... terrible things are coming, Lois. I can feel it. When the Daily Planet said "Superman is dead," it painted a target on the Earth. Why did you come here? Because I need your voice. I can't protect the people if they think I'm a fake, Lois. Even if you won't believe I'm Superman at least believe that I'm trying to do some good. And maybe write about that. Get in. Just like you would any new product. So far, all you've managed to do is preen, and gallivant, and... Stop that! Where's Mercy? Still in traction, thanks to you. Have you seen the newspapers? Yeah, I've seen them all over the place. Have you read them? Oh. Right on! This really reflects more on you. Do you know what they're calling you? Superboy. But... I'm Superman. They didn't get the memo. This entire roll-out has been a disaster. Goggles and the robot are getting all the good press. While you're strutting across TV screens like a clown. Don't you mean clone? Thanks for the heads-up, by the way. Oh, please. So you were genetically engineered. Who isn't? Little DNA from here, some from there. Bam! You're born. Mazel tov! The only difference between you and a biological child is that I've invested a hell of a lot more capital to bring you to the party. So, we are going to start again. It's a relaunch. Superman 2.0.1. That's awful, but we'll let marketing sort it all out. What do you want me to do? You've had your fun, Superboy, but now it's time to act like a man. I got you a gig. They just passed Burnett Boulevard. Coming up on Rodeo. I think they say Ro-day-o. They're wrong. Lantern? Yeah, I say Ro-day-o. - Report! - Oh! Smooth sailing up here. Flash? - I just wanna ask. - Ah, here it comes. I'm just saying. Are we presidential bodyguards, or are we the Justice League? Today, we're bodyguards. And you don't think there's other stuff we should be doing? The Titans have it covered. The Teen Titans. Oh, yeah! I feel good about that. Chillax, Zippy. The Titans are cool. Zippy? Wait. Did he just say "Chillax"? Young man, stay off this frequency. It's for League members only. No, it's for the President's protective detail. As the new head of LexCorp global security, I qualify. I have the shot. I say take it. That's enough. We have a job to do. Okay. Can we speed this up, because if I'm not home by dinner, Iris is gonna kill me. Someone should go say hi. I'm a little busy right now. I don't really know him. Vic? Oh, so you think all cyborgs know each other? Yes. But, in my defense, I'm horribly insensitive. Lex is so wrong. You guys are funky fresh. Donovan's been letting you watch those 90s sitcoms again, I see. Lex? I'm in your other ear. Reminding you to stay alert. President Dale has her eye on you. Keep her safe. By the end of the week, with a little political maneuvering, she'll be publicly recognizing you as the one true Superman. Yesterday, my husband said, "Joan, why do you have to do this?" And I said, "Because I stand with the Justice League as they have stood with us." Really, I'm thrilled to be here. To help dedicate the Justice League's new Watchtower. A proud... Madam President... I've got you, ma'am. I've got her, everyone! Uh, Lois? Everybody clear out! Kid, if I find out LexCorp had anything to do with this... Look, Mr. Roboto, we got bigger problems. The boy's right. Let's go. Watch your step. Come on. No rush. Uh, a little rush, actually. Hey, metal head! You wanna lend a hand? Superman? At your service, Madam President. Time to get you out of here. We're still reeling from the latest alien attack, and the devastating loss of the Justice League. President Dale will speak at a memorial in Centennial Park to honor the fallen. Alongside the man whose heroic actions have proven to us all that he truly is Superman, reborn. And let me just say, it feels good to have him back. Couldn't find the remote? That is not Superman. We had a real opportunity here! A real opportunity, and you blew it! Come along, son. Lex, is... Hey, I did what you told me to do. Everything I'm capable of doing. And you still lost. I gave you every advantage Superman had, and more. And I appreciate... Wait, more? Wait here. I remember this place. There you are. Dr. Donovan? What happened to you? You father is a... ...hard man. My father? Do you mean Superman? I don't work for Super... Oh, no. I thought he would've told you. I, uh... I didn't mean to... Well, look who's talking. Again! Mr. Luthor, please! What's going on? It's all right, Dabney. Tell him. What difference could it make now? - I don't think I... - Tell him! The DNA, your DNA, - its... - Superman's. Yes, but also... I told you I gave you more. All of Superman's strength, plus all the Luthor intellect. Supposedly. He just needs guidance. Please! We got so much closer with this one than any of the others. You're right, Dabney. The current model really is leaps and bounds ahead of his brothers. I don't know what I was thinking. Let's go. And Dabney, you're fired. No! No! Still can't keep his mouth shut. If you're through indulging in this emotional nonsense, we have work to do, Superman. Yes, master. It was him. Well, half of him, anyway. Was he with anyone else? Only her. Terri Henshaw. He was pretty out of it. Stood there half the night talkin' to the air. Looked tormented. 'Course, that's not unusual around here. It is for Superman. It's about time you showed up. What the... Yeah, you shouldn't leave your bathroom window open. Anyone could get in here. So, I got a lead at the cemetery that I think we should... John? You know that I know you're Steel, right? And I'm literally the worst at secret identities. I mean, if you couldn't fool me... Superman saved my life, once. Now that he's gone, I owe it to him to fill the void. Neat! What did you find at the cemetery? Terri Henshaw? The astronaut? She was on the Excalibur, right? Yup. Can you access the S.T.A.R. Labs' mainframe from here? If the cyborg's telling the truth, that he really is Superman, then why would he go to Terri Henshaw's grave? This is odd. It says Henshaw's remains were never recovered. Sorry. Remains were recovered for Terri Henshaw, but not for Hank Henshaw. The Henshaws. Of course! The husband and wife astronauts. We did a huge story on them. They were both assigned to the Excalibur. So, it was the husband's body that was never found. It's him, John. It's why he was visiting Terri's grave. I don't know how, but the cyborg Superman is Hank Henshaw. Huh? Superman? I... I don't think... The Justice League were the best among us. As such, they would want us to celebrate today. Not mourn. Yet, here we are. Surrounded by reminders in stone of the mournful times that have befallen our world. It's only by a miracle of alien science that I am here today. Alive. Standing in for the real heroes we lost During the Doomsday battle, the Watchtower attack, and too many other bloody incursions. We need to shut this asshole down. How? He's Superman to them. I could try to pitch the Henshaw story to Perry White, but without any evidence, he won't go near it. Which is why today, I am announcing the establishment of a new, stronger League. A Cyborg Corp, to honor those who have perished in the name of justice, and I'm taking volunteers. What the hell? - I volunteer. - What? But I don't have any power. No one has. Not really. But I can change all that if you come forth. Eric, no! Becky, please. This could change everything. For the world, for us. Welcome to the team. I can give each of you the power to be your own hero. The same technology that saved me, can save us all. Doomsday was only the beginning. Our enemies haven't been destroyed. Only delayed. When they return, who will stand and fight with me? This is it. This is his plan. How the hell did Hank Henshaw get his hands on that kinda tech? Intergang's been running Luthor's Apokolips tech. I can get to them. Find out if they have ties to Cyborg Superman. Sounds like a plan. I'll go lean on Lex. Take your time, boys. Ain't nobody watchin' the store today. So you're saying that's the way to Hob's Bay? Eric? Can you fly? Oh, come on! Not again! I believe this belongs to you. My hero. Do you require further assistance? Eric. It's me, Becky. Are you okay? I haven't heard from you in days. Okay, stop it. You're scaring me. Have a pleasant day, citizen. Eric? Eric! Doyle, I know you're here. I'm not looking for trouble. I just need information on some alien tech you may have unloaded. What the hell? What happened here? Superman cleaned us out. The one in the shades. The Eradicator? Here. Traces on our stuff. You can catch up with him if you hurry. Go get him. Don't wait up. We both know you took me down there to get rid of Superboy for good. I don't know what changed you mind, but... Oh. I thought you were... Let me guess. You thought I was Lex Luthor. Lookin' for ol' cue ball. Know where he is, Superboy? Don't call me that! What's wrong? He's my father. At least, he's half my DNA. I just found out. Nah, I don't buy it. I mean, the hair alone. Wow. You do look like him. Superman, I mean. Look, I was a jerk when I met you, Lois. I'm sorry. I don't know why, but... I feel like I can talk to you. I know why. Yeah. Eradicator's gathering up Apokolips tech. He could be working with Henshaw. I'm tracking him now. All right. Keep me posted. Greetings. Uh, greetings? Kal-El is unavailable as he nears completion of his revitalization cycle. Thank you for your patience. Kal-El? So it really is you. Whoa, Steel! What's happening? Little busy here, Lois. You called me. Sorry. Butt dial. What the hell is going on, here? Give me that. Oh, don't! - Is that... - Kal-El's ship! From S.T.A.R. Labs. He needs help. I'm going. No. These cyborg thingies are popping up all over the city. It's gonna take a turn and I need you here. You're not the boss of me, Lex. I literally am. You cannot harm the data matrix. The data matrix? John! It's a hologram! It's designed to protect Kryptonians. I don't see any Kryptonians around here. Do you? Oh, my god! John, he's... These pitiful humans. Humbled by the demise of their heroes, have willingly become mindless automatons. My stratagem has worked perfectly. Soon, Earth will be christened by Darkseid as New Apokolips. And this time, there's no Justice League or Superman to stop me. All that remains is for you to open the gates. All you gotta do is look out the window to see things ain't right no more. I knew Superman. Superman was my pal. And those things ain't Supermen. They're not even the people they used to be. I mean, at least they're keeping the peace, right? You know that ain't gonna last. We can't wait until after this thing takes a turn for the worse. By then, it'll be too late! The robot said one thing right. He said, "We gotta be our own heroes." People are protesting down at the Watchtower. Getting to be quite a crowd. What are we waitin' for? Together, we may not be able to bring the beat down, but we sure as hell can make some noise. Am I right? Last one for now. Any luck? No. Systems are operating normally, but for some reason I can't open a boom tube here. Any idea where "here" is? I don't recognize any of these star formations. J'onn? They're foreign to me as well. That's because they're not stars. What are they? Hungry. I'm just gonna hide behind the Amazon till Vic gets us home. There's nothin' doin', guys. Unless someone from the other side reaches out to bring us back... we are home. You sure don't hit like a hologram. Intruders must be... That's enough! Steel stopped transmitting. I can't find a signal. Even after redirecting every LexCorp satellite. So, do you really think Kal-El is alive? I don't know. But, for the first time, I really feel like it's possible. For the first time, I hope he is. Now, there's something you need to see. It's really you, isn't it? How? Honestly, I don't know. The robots keep calling it a revitalization cycle. But it's not something I'd ever heard of or knew was possible. What is this place? A fortress. Built to keep me isolated during this... process. Does he have to just stand there like that? It's creepin' me out. He's just trying to protect me. Then why was he drawing energy from you while you were in the pod? Quite the reverse. Kal-El was the one absorbing ion radiation from the Eradicator as part of the revitalization cycle. Highly advanced tech programmed to protect my people. So, he decided to put on a cape and dispense his own brand of justice? I'm just saying. Well, I can't tell you how glad I am to see you again. There's a lot you need to know. These broadcasts have brought me up-to-speed. Darkseid killed my friends, and people are being turned into monsters by that cyborg impostor. Hank Henshaw. The astronaut? I thought he was dead. I guess I didn't know everything. There's a lot of that goin' around. So, what's the plan Dad? And this time there's no Justice League or Superman to stop me. All that remains is for you to open the gates. Ever since the League's "accident," my satellites have intercepted strange encoded signals. It's some kind of holographic interface Darkseid is beaming directly into Henshaw's head. He's literally messing with his mind. Once Superman was gone, he cleared out the Justice League, created an army of cybernetic minions, and now... They open the gates. How do we even begin to fight that? I might have something. Is it a plan? Because, what we really need is a plan. The plan is to stop Darkseid, and save Henshaw. And get the girl. Slash girls. Until your regeneration is complete, I must insist you abstain from sexual activity. Um, all right? You're not fully powered yet, are you? For how long? I don't know. Maybe forever. After Darkseid's first invasion, you couldn't walk down the street without tripping over alien tech. Yeah, tech that you gave Intergang. Gave? You really don't get me, do you? And anyway, you're welcome. Because that business arrangement is what brought us... This beauty. A Mother Box? We just have to activate it outside the Watchtower at exactly the right spot. Unfortunately, the Tin Man's got eyes everywhere. One of us will have to go inside and keep him occupied while the other turns this on. Okay. Show me how it works. Are you insane? I'm not going in there, you are. Kal-El, I must insist on accompanying you. Bad idea. This guy's a wild card. Maybe a wild card is what we need. What we need is a way to get you to Metropolis. It's 40 below outside, and you're just a guy now. A guy with a spaceship. Slammin'! Excuse me? Do people not say that anymore? We are not machines! Listen, Lane. - I just wanna say... - Thank you? Don't screw up. Hey, you two. Over here. Take me to your boss. Seriously. A room-full of hungry Bizarros. Sounds harrowing. So, can I live with you or not? Guys, I'm getting an incoming call from a LexCorp number. Could be Lois. I'm bouncing it over. Oh! It's you. Lex Luthor. As I live and breathe. Yeah, what's that about? Where's Lois? As much as I'd love to chat, I'm only calling to ask sonny boy if he wouldn't mind popping by for a stretch. I'm downtown in the thick of it, and, well I could use some muscle. The boy stays with me, and I need to know now that Lois is all right. Oh, she's fine. She's in the Watchtower. What? To think that all this was made possible when my Doomsday weapon obliterated your primitive spacecraft. I plucked your lifeless corpse from the void, and handed you a chance for glory. Yes, your grace. And all because a Kryptonian failed you. Even in death he will pay for his crimes. To capture glory, Henshaw, you must first understand that sorrow, rage, and the thirst for vengeance, are essential parts of the equation. Sir? What now? Leave us. Dr. Frankenstein. Or is it his monster? So easy to get mixed up. Frankenstein wanted to play god. Do I look like I'm playing? You're gonna lose, Hank. Hank Henshaw's dead. Just like your beloved knight in blue tights. Of all the things I learned on your balcony that night, I think the most important was the true nature of your relationship with Superman. A relationship, I'm afraid, that's about to meet a tragic end. Alert! Watchtower detecting an incoming ballistic rocket of Kryptonian origin. Enlarging view. Superman. I knew you'd come. No! Not now! So, my Doomsday weapon failed, and the Kryptonian still lives. Get out of my head! Yes! I shall enjoy killing the man of steel all over again. This time, with my bare hands. No! Superman is mine to destroy! We disagree. Open the gates! Prepare for my arrival. No! What the hell? For Apokolips! No! Not yet! Not now! My God! I thought Superman was yours. You just gonna hand him to Darkseid? Wow. What? Henshaw! No! Now that they've been cut-off from Darkseid, the Cyborg Corps is mine to control. And I've just ordered them to destroy Superman's precious Metropolis. Ah, come on! This is it! Light 'em up! I've sacrificed everything, now, just to kill him. But not before I've made him watch as I tear you limb from limb. Even he can't save you. Ah, come on! What am I doing wrong? Excuse me. Mind if we kick your ass? You're welcome! The napkin at Bibbo's. What was your last secret? I love you. Clark! I love... Sorry to interrupt this tender moment. Hank, you have to stop this. Darkseid is... No longer your biggest problem. Stay here. I'll take care of you later. Over my dead body. It isn't too late. There's always a way out. How about for my wife? Was there a way out for her? Is this what Terri would want? Don't say her name! You're not allowed to say her name. She's dead because of you. She was always apprehensive in space. She tried to hide it, but I knew. I told her she'd be okay. We all would. We had Superman. Until we didn't. Until my ship and my crew were debris. And you weren't even dead, yet! Just too busy. All you hear today is, "How do we live in a world without Superman?" Well, some of us already had to. Some of us watched as everything we had, everything we loved, was lost. Oh, give it a rest! Huh? This isn't about your wife and you know it. It's about you. You let Darkseid turn you into this. Superman turned me into this. Darkseid only rebuilt me and taught me how to wield my hatred as a weapon. - Just like he'd done with... - Doomsday. That beast was only a mindless assassin. While I was set to a singular purpose. Destroy what remains of Superman. His good name. It was the best revenge I could hope for. Until now. This is nuts! We should be in there helping Superman. If you can find a way past these guys, I'm right behind ya. I need a power source. Luthor! What the hell have you done? Robo people? Come on! How long were we gone? Finally! Luthor? You brought us back? Don't add me to your friends list yet. This was purely a business move. Get to work! The whole city's infested. Spread out. Alert! Justice League members detected. Breach imminent. It's only a matter of time now, Hank. Once they get inside... That'll be difficult for them once we've achieved orbit. We'll be together soon, Terri. This is between us, Hank. Let her go. Once we've left the exosphere, you and your gal-pal will suffocate. Freeze. And it's all your fault. It's almost poetry. Get away from him, you son of a bitch! Come out, Lois. One way or another, this is gonna end badly for you. Killing you isn't revenge unless your boyfriend has to watch. Open your eyes. You're gonna watch this if I have to tear off your eyelids! Open them! You won't kill me and I won't stop until I kill you. You're right. It's not how I'm programmed. But you should know I've got a wildcard up my sleeve. What? What is this? Eradication. Clark! - Is it over? - Yes. There's still one more thing I need to do. Oh, Eric! Six months and 400 miles later, a happy return for one of the Daily Planet's own. Clark Kent, feared lost in the Doomsday fight, is back home tonight. Thanks to the keen eye of another Metropolis citizen we thought we'd lost. I recognized Mr. Kent from his byline photo and brought him home. Martian Manhunter sounds nothing like me. Oh, everybody says that. Hey, I almost forgot. Conner's all settled. He said, "Thanks for the sweater, babe." Aw! They're gonna eat him alive. So, where did we leave off? Yeah? You're late. Right. Be there in a sec. Oh, tell Lois I'll see her Friday. Friday? What is it? Worlds colliding. Also, I have to go. It's okay. I understand. I'll wait up. Henshaw may be gone, but this was still the boldest move we've seen from Apokolips, yet. Darkseid won't stay down for long and we can't play defense forever. Then we agree. We're going to have to take this fight to his doorstep. Excellent. Count me in... team. Okay, who left the front door open?
