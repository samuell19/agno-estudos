FAMILY AFFAIR The stadium is full tonight... Come on, Caué, this wine was mine! Finders keepers. - What's the score? - It's a tie. Still? - Give me the bottle, man. - Come and get it. You're hurting me, you animal! Hey, shut up, you two! Shit, man! Scared the São Paulo supporter... Do we have any food? The food is on the oven. You didn't say you were coming for lunch. Make me a plate, then. What's the score? Can't you see it? Are you smoking again? If Dad catches you... Goal! Up yours, pigs! He just stood there watching his team get further away from the top. São Paulo has played much better in the second half. You know I don't like tomatoes in my sandwiches. That was Rossi's. It's over. I'm switching to domino. One-nil is close, man. The next game will be at their stadium. - Shall we go? - Are you buying? You're useless. Well, classic games are like that. But in my opinion it's not hard to beat Palmeiras. That's a good sandwich, Mum. If a guy doesn't pay the bill, he's hot worth it. Don't you agree, ladies? Mum? Caué has got his friends coming over. I'm going to bed, OK? Did you see the mistake he made? What are you staring at? - What's up, Rossi? - Shut the door. All good? - Nipples slip? - All out? She totally flashed me. What do you want? - Can I have a glass of water? - What? - He needs a glass of water. - Tap's over there, man. But the tap isn't filtered. I'll grab it from the filter, OK? Oh, he only drinks filtered water. No, drink this. - Enough, man. - Leave it. Like that? Drink it all, Rossi. Come on. Enough with this shit, man. Fuck off, Rossi. Go, fuck off. Leave my brother... - What about the nipples? - Did you see them? Thanks. - Do you have any cigarettes? - I don't smoke. What about Mrs Eunice? My mum hides her cigarettes in the laundry. - Show me where. - Follow me. Do you have a light? Do you wanna smoke? I don't think I even know how. - Wanna try it? - Just suck it? Try it. - It burns, doesn't it? - A little. I don't think I sucked it right. Try again. What's the secret? - Just suck it. - Like a straw? - One-nil is a good result, right? - I was hoping for two. At least it's three points in the championship. After this game, they're going all the way. - São Paulo, shmaulo! - You cunt! São Paulo won tonight. Nobody is gonna sleep in this whole city. Go fuck yourself, queer! Look out for the flip-ﬂops! You're lame! Yellow flip-ﬂops! Son of a bitch! He wears yellow flip-ﬂops! This place is full of pigs. Fuck you! - That's so lame. - His flips-ﬂops! That's the best he can do.
