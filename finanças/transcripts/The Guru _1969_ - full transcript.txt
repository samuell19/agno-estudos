(Screaming and cheering) Woman on radio: The world-famous pop singer declared in a statement to all-India radio that he had come to this country to study the sitar under the guidance of ustad zafar Khan. Mr. Pickle has left his many commitments to the west in order to devote himself entirely to the study of Indian music. He also expressed a desire to visit kashmir, and other well-known beauty spots, and to learn as much as possible... (Man speaking in hindi) ... its customs, and its people. - He said... - (Radio turned off) (Doorbell rings) He's coming. Ah. I've been waiting and waiting. Come. Here. You eat this. Eat it. Crowd chanting: We want Tom, we want Tom! (Chanting continues) Excuse me. Thank you. How do you like our India, Mr. Pickle? I like it. - Do you? - (Laughter) - Have you met ustad zafar Khan yet? - Sure. Do you wish to learn only sitar or any other Indian instrument? Oh, sitar will do me all right for now. Are you going to join his school in benares? Don't know about that. Have you had your first lesson yet? Sure. I've been learning in London for quite a bit. Would you call yourself a refugee from the materialistic values of the west? Come again. Have you reached a point of no return in your personal life? Way past it. I suppose you take LSD. Can't do without it, miss. You enjoy our Indian food? I beg your pardon. Do you enjoy our Indian food? Do I enjoy your Indian food? - Yes. - It's lovely. Are you aware that, to learn Indian music, it takes 30 years of intensive study? Can't stay that long. Do you think it possible for a foreigner to grasp the true values inherent in our Indian music? Do you know what those values are? Have you come to forge a bridge between east and west? No. I've come to learn the sitar. (Man speaking in hindi) Tom. Tom. Why do you encourage these people? - It gives a vulgar atmosphere. - Sorry. So you're sorry? Well, you should be. (Speaks hindi) I won't need these anymore, Howard. - I'm leaving. - What? I found my guru. - I'm going to study music, Howard. - Why? I'm really terribly musical. Mummy started me on the piano, but that was wrong. But the sitar's different. It's a kind of religion, really, isn't it? I guess everything is religion. Say good-bye to the others for me. Tell them... Oh, I don't know. Anything you like. I feel so fulfilled, Howard. (Doorbell rings) (Speaking hindi) (Doorbell rings) May I speak to Khan sahib? (Speaking hindi) Khan sahib. What do you want? I have to see him, please. (Khan speaking hindi) Who are you? What do you want? Hey, where are you going with those bags? (Speaking hindi) Please be my guru. Please be my guru. - Huh? - I want to learn. What does she want to learn at this time of night? Do you play something? I want to start, with you. How do you know you're talented? I'll work so hard. Hard work without talent? What is she doing? Mad woman! Please, get up. Get up. Say you'll be my guru. We shall see. Let her sleep in that room tonight. She and who else? Go with her. We shall talk about it tomorrow, huh? Well, I can sleep anywhere. Here on the floor. Go with her. Do you think I'll make a good pupil? You have the right heart. Come. Now girls are sleeping here. (Plucks sitar strings) (Singing scales) You're late. I've been waiting. Now girls are brought into this house? Go away. Perhaps you'll be starting dancing classes also. She'll kill me. Go and die. Play. All your fingers should be together. Why have you come to me? What do you mean? I thought you came to be my shagrid, I'll be your ustad, your guru. That's right. Do you know the meaning of the word guru? (Jenny still practicing scales) Let her be quiet. (Speaks hindi) Ustad. Tell her it's enough. All right, so she can't sing, but she has the right heart. - You called? - Yes. You've practiced enough for today. But I don't think I've got it quite right yet. What's he laughing for? He's a fool. You're a good pupil. I mean, you have the right attitude. I am very pleased with you. Do you treat me with this respect? (Humming) You should be living here with US, like the others. Don't you think you ought? Who asked you? Go now. We're talking. Go now. Tom, I want you to leave your hotel today. You must be joking. You say no to your ustad? Very well. I dismiss you. I send you away. Okay. Where are you going? Bye. You can say this to your newspapers. "My guru has sent me away in disgrace." Where do you think you are going? Come back! You haven't had your lesson yet. Tom! Tom. Your lesson. You can teach me tomorrow when you've cooled down a bit. I'm scared. (Pop music playing) Are you Patty? His bird? What? You know, bird. No, I'm afraid not. Oh. Smoke? Do you dig his sound? No, I'm studying the sitar. Oh, really? I've been looking for you. Noise. You know, they'll do harm to Tom. I've tried to explain to him. Our music is not just music. It's also... How shall I say? To learn it, you must know what it feels to be an Indian. To become Indian. Do you understand? I don't speak very well. All this is wrong. It isn't Indian. It'll harm him. Do you like my ring? - Oh, yeah. - It's Tibetan. It's lovely. If you like it, I'd love to give it to you. Excuse me. This is the first time I've been alone with you. You know, I like this. I'll get my parents to send you one. Oh, no. Customs will charge too much duty. What is it? - Sh! - Try it and see. What did you say it was called? Bhang. - What is it? - Why bhang? Why bhang? Please tell me. Nothing new to you, I'm sure. I don't take it. Musicians always take it. Haven't you seen their eyes? Tell me, does it give you inspiration? My inspiration comes from here. Oh, really? Try some. Don't take it. It's not good. My god, it's starting. It burns. No, it's cold. I'm seaweed. Can you see? I'm seaweed. Yeah, I see. It's lovely. It's like seaweed. All loose. You look it, darling. Oops. Oh, what a lovely ring. - Will you stay? - Hmm? Please stay. Is he coming? I don't know. I feel so trapped here. No one understands me. They just don't talk the same language. What's that wonderful song of yours? I wouldn't dare sing it in front of you. You know, "yesterday, I heard the clock tick. "Is it always going to be like this? Rainy weather, empty bed." Oh, something... "Ash in my cup of tea." "Ash in my cup of tea." I've forgotten, but it's so wonderful. You wrote that song for me. Did you know that? Did you, Tom? Dear Tom. (Chanting in arabic) Just stay here only. Don't come inside. (Conversing in hindi and arabic) Hey, what's the matter? Hey, what's wrong? Nothing. Tom! Go on. He's calling. You want me? Mmm. I can't teach you today. You ill? It's you who made me ill. - Me? - You and your friends. They're evil. Oh, come off it. Look, they're just a bunch of very ordinary people, trying to be something they're not. Why should you get steamed up about them? They have made me ill. No, no, no, no. No, I can't teach you. You can go. I want to raise you to my level. Instead, you're pulling me down to yours. Oh! No, I can't teach you because you're wrong here. Here! (Coughs) Lie down. Lie down. Lie down. - Tell him to go. - Go. (Elevator bell rings) Why have you come back? Just to tell you I quit. It is I who dismiss you. Any way you like, but I'm through. (Both speaking in foreign dialects) Who is he, god or something? Actually, a guru is a sort of god. Don't start that again. Look, I come here to learn some music. Simple as that. All I get to hear about is how I got to honor my guru. Doesn't it make you happy to respect someone so much that you want to give him everything? Oh, do US a favor. I've never felt like this about anyone before, but with him, it's different. Why don't you sleep with him then? Get it over with. You're sick. Do you know what he's doing now? He's gone to haji Ali to pray. Come and see him, Tom. Please. Tom says he's going. Well, don't disturb my mind now. I'd hoped for so much. But I've achieved nothing. We'll tell the papers I learned it all in a week. "I have nothing more to teach him, says guru." When I first heard you were coming, I was proud. The famous idol of the west. It was a triumph for me. But when you came, then I wasn't proud. I was humble. Go and talk to him. Go on. He came to take bread, and I gave him stone. This is like the bloody arabian nights. You think i'm play-acting, don't you? No, I think you're blackmailing. Well, what do you want? You want me to leave that hotel, isn't it? It is you who must want. All right. Did you say all right? Come on. Tonight, the begum will cook pilao for you. And I shall play for you. Come on. Hurry up, come on. Come. - It was nice tonight, huh? - Mmm. You'll be very happy when you come to bijapur for our festival. There will be music day and night. When do we go? After we come back from benares. You're going to benares? Of course. I must see the school. Hmm. My school is very good. I love my students very much. And the teachers. We are like one big family. Sometimes, when I'm not there, things begin to go wrong. Quarrels and so on. So I have to go. Gently, gently. Ask him who else there is in benares. - Be quiet. - Ask him. You know nothing. I'm going on business. You're spoiling my mood. Do the fingers now. Who else is there in benares? Don't listen to her. Go to bed. Tom. Mm? Sit down. In benares, I shall be staying with my wife. Begum sahib is coming, too? No. With my other wife. Oh? - Tom. - Mm? Begum sahib hasn't given me any sons. Only daughters. Five daughters. Five. It's a lot. Mmm. We are allowed four wives. I have only two. (Speaking hindi) This is ghazala. How do you do? Make yourselves comfortable in there. I'll be right back. Get them some tea. Come. (Speaking hindi) Who's that? Who is it? Who was that? His wife. I like cold season better than hot. I suffer so much here in the summer. In england, is it really all that cold? It gets pretty awful. Next time he goes, he's taking me. I am looking forward to it. What clothes will I need, do you think? - Will you come shopping with me? - I'd love to. You know, I've never had an English friend before. - Please. - What about you? I can't. Nowadays, I feel... What's the matter? - Well... - Congratulations. When? In six months' time. Do you like the way I do my hair? This way? Try the other one again. Like that? Yes. That way. You've never worn a sari before, I suppose. No. Actually, this one is a wedding sari. Did you have a very big wedding? Mm-mm. I think you're awfully lucky to be married to Khan sahib. Oh, Jenny. I mean, it's such a privilege to be near someone like him. Well, he wanted a modern wife. An educated girl. Like me. I studied in a convent. See? You look quite nice now. Why don't you do your hair differently? Like that? I can't manage it any other way. What is she like? Who? That other one. Begum sahib? Very old? Not very. And ugly? Oh, and all those girls. I shall give him a son. How do you know? I know. How? - I've been to see someone. - Who? An astrologer. His method is completely scientific. (Changing stations) When you get back to Bombay, she'll ask you a lot about me. What will you say? I don't know. She will ask if I'm very beautiful. (Music plays) Let's dance. I hope i'm doing it right. I learned it in the convent. It's fine. Hello, Tom. - Oh... - Jenny. Why don't you dance with her? May I? - Oh, come on. - Go on. Am I doing it all right? It's great. Very good. (People talking) Hey, Jen! Come up here a minute. Do US a favor, will you? Don't ask any questions, but there's a bloke outside that I know. Bring him upstairs, will you? We'll give him a surprise, all right? Ah, hello. I'm looking for a Mr. Tom pickle. Uh, don't you speak English? Oh. Christ. Tom, how's it going? Very funny. Ha ha ha. What a journey. Don't ask. I'm not. Oi, I'm finished. What you want? What do you think I want? - I'm staying. - I knew it. Ah, I know who you are. You're the one all the fuss is about. That's right. I'm Chris Todd, Tom's manager. I invented him. Tom: Do me a favor. Isn't he rude? I hope he doesn't give you as much trouble as that, does he? Don't tell me. I know. (Both laughing) He wants me to go back. Now let me explain briefly. Los Angeles, San Francisco, Montreal, New York. And a big, big film, if we like it. I know you're a man who's gonna understand this. Are those people gonna wait forever? Huh? I appreciate the work you're doing here. I think it's very valuable. I certainly wouldn't ask you to give it up. I would dream of asking that. He's made very good progress. And he'll come back here. Or better still, why don't you go to england? People back in London are crazy for the Indian music. One could... Arrange things. I'm not leaving. - Oh, Tom. - I wanna stay here. I want you to be here, but we mustn't be selfish. You two play well together, don't you? Nice little doublet. Tom, even if you're 1,000 miles away, you will still be here with me, because we are one. What we all gabbin' about anyway? I'm not goin'. That's it. Had a terrible journey. The champagne wasn't iced, and the hostess had thick ankles. Oh, don't get impressed with him. He comes off the same bomb site as I do. Yeah, but look what I made of myself. Sharp, though, he was, that one. Always cheating at marbles. Doin' everyone out their bubble gum. Very sexy. (Imitates sitar sound) ( Tom humming ) You look a lovely couple in that gear. You'll go down all right, you know-- Tom pickle and the girl yogi. Ah, get lost. Why not? They'll love it. Anyway, time you had a new girl. We've all heard enough about patsy. - Who's patsy? - Who's--? Ha ha ha! Tell me! Is it a secret? It's a love affair, isn't it? Ha ha ha ha! Isn't she jolly? I love her. Can I take her home with me? - Mr. Chris! Don't be so naughty. - Gotcha. Don't you fancy him, then? - He's all right. - Why don't you marry Tom? It'll be such fun! We'll make a really good wedding for you here. How about it, then? She's turned me down. Oh, what a shame. Hey, what about US two? Oh, really! ( Speaking hindi ) What's all that? Something wrong? Keep this, Jenny. Oh. Thank you. - Keep your hands off her. - What you talkin' about? They don't like it here. I don't like it, either. What's come over you? Just keep off. ( Man speaking hindi ) ( Bell rings, birds shriek ) I want to go to the bank to see if my money's arrived. Don't your parents mind you bumming around like this? Not really. They're awfully broad-minded. Actually, they think I'm traveling with a girlfriend, Rosemary. - We started off together. - What happened to Rosemary? We were traveling through Damascus and she met an arab boy she liked. - So? - She stayed. I wonder how she's getting on. ( All playing music ) Aren't they nice? Awfully scruffy. I love the way they come to take in India... Really merging. Is that what they're doing? Not like in the old days. English people never used to mix with Indians. To them they were inferior-- just natives. All that British empire stuff, it makes you sick. What's it got to do with me? My grandfather was on the dole for eight years. My dad had rickets as a kid because all he ever had to eat was bread and drippings. That's what my lot got out of their flamin' British empire. Hey, Jen, listen to this, see what you think of it. * the temple bells over the water * * the cows and the holy men * * the sound of the sitar * * burning incense-- * no, no. Um, start again. * the temple bells over the water * * the cows and the holy men * * the sound of the sitar * * the smell of the incense * * Jasmine * * the dust and the flies * * I don't know why it is so * * but I feel * * it's strange, but I feel * * let me stay, let me learn * * let me listen * * meditate * it's nice. I like it. You're getting better, Tom. Thanks very much. I mean as a person. You're not so like you were. It's his influence, of course. No one who's near him can help become a better person. You've really got it bad, haven't you? It's not only him. It's everything he is. Sort of mystic, really. Hmm. ( Chuckles ) When you get back it's gonna be absolute chaos. Remember last year in the states? Well, double it. - Fine. - Just so you know. - Oh, I know, all right. - ( Car horn honks ) Hey, there. Do you need any help? Oh, no, no. Be all right in a minute. - You need a lift? - No, thanks. Aren't you Tom pickle? In the flesh, madam, in the flesh. Well, it's all too much. Drive on, driver, please. Oh, what'd you have to come here for? You made me all nervous again. - Ha ha ha ha! Nervous is good news for me, boy. What do I have to come here for? You haven't been reading my letters, haven't been answering my cables. - You been tearing 'em up, haven't you? - I've been so peaceful. - Oh, Christ. He's been peaceful. - Driver: The car is ready. - Come on, you'll miss your plane. - Oh, leave off. You know something? I hate flying. Oh, come on, get in. ( Starts car ) Perhaps I should take one for my guru also. Winter nights in bijapur can be so cold, you know. He's old...And thin. - Bones only. - Jenny: Look at US. We're deciding what to wear tonight. Don't you like ghazala's new sari? What are you doing? - Doesn't she look super? - Where are you going? To the beauty contest at the hotel de Paris. - You can't go there. - Tom's one of the judges. Go in. You're going to a beauty contest dressed like this?! You don't let me do anything! You can't go there. They're going. Suppose they jumped into a well--you'll jump also? ( Sniffling ) Look what I bought for you. There. There you are. - You didn't buy it for me. - Hmm? - You bought it for yourself. - No, no. For you. ( Both playing ) * Why have you stopped playing? I've gotta go and get ready. Don't go. Let's go on playing. - Wish I could. - Then stay. But they'll be waiting, those people at the hotel de Paris. - Let them wait. - But I promised. I'll teach you the vilambet gat bilaval. I'm in the mood now. - Yeah, well, I wish I could stay. - Then stay. A promise is a promise. ( Bell ringing in distance ) ( Bell continues ) - You...going out tonight? - With Tom. This is the time we play poorbi. The heart is tender... Full of love. You know, Tom has many gifts... But no understanding at all. He thinks you can learn Indian music as you learn to cook or drive a car. - Jenny... - Yes? Don't go to this place tonight. All right. You see, a shagrid's life must be simple. Pure. Must belong completely to his music... To his guru. I belong completely to my guru. Yeah. - Come on. - I'm not coming. - What's he been saying to you? - I don't want to go. I didn't want to go. I love being here with you. Hmm. Well, it's time for food. Emcee: Number 12, shireen majidulla. Shireen's hobbies are cooking, sewing, and listening to light romantic music. Number 15, miss aasha gunwuilli, another air hostess. It looks like air India is going to be the most popular airline in the world! Number 20, miss manju adarwal. Manju is a student at lady mountbatten where she is studying child psychology and interior decoration. Miss santhos kaul, number 21. Santhos is studying for a degree in philosophy and political science. But her ambition is to be an air hostess. Number 23, miss baby takkar, from meerut. - ( Whispering ) - Ladies and gentlemen, baby's engaged to be married, and her ambition is to be a housewife and a mother. ( Baby cries, audience laughs ) Number 24, miss papu gupta from muradabad, who wants to enter for the foreign service exam and be an ambassador for our country abroad... Excuse me. Won't you please sing for US? "Ash in my cup of tea"? - "Stay away"? - Sorry. - Just this once? - No singing. Not while I'm in India. Just sit down. - Hey, I liked your group. - Thanks. Play a lot of places? We're students. We do it for a little more pocket money. But we'd like to go professional. I've got a few ideas, if you have some time. Sure. Come see me. - Tomorrow? - Fine. ( Boogie-woogie rock ) ( Audience applauds ) ( Drummer plays burlesque musical cue ) ( Cheers, whistling, applause ) Emcee: Jolly good! Very good! ( Indistinct shouting ) ( Whistling ) Audience chanting: Tom! Tom! Tom! ( All shouting ) ( Cheering, shouting ) Quiet! Quiet! Chanting: Tom pickle! Tom pickle! Tom pickle! ( Chanting continues ) ( Distant voices ) Yes? Excuse me. Does Mr. Tom pickle stay here? - Why? - He asked me to come see him this morning. - I'll just go and see. - Thanks. He wants to see Tom, ustad. I'm Arnold d'mellow. I play at the hotel de Paris. So, you were there yesterday? Wonderful. What sort of a name do you think this will give me, and the school? You can't see him. I'll not allow it. Tom: Oi! Hello. Looking for me? Hey! Here! Hey, what's the matter? What's up? Ask him. Here, don't go. I sent him away. You what? I decide who comes here and who goes. Oh, no, you don't. You teach me music. Just music. See? That's your business; The rest is mine. - Just music. - Uh-huh. You've-- you've understood nothing. Not a thing. Everything I've taught you is a waste. Well, that's just too bad, isn't it? We are leaving! You can start packing. We're leaving, murad. When you wear this, think of me. Thank you. You'll look super. He'll never let me wear it. Just keep it, then. I wish you were here always. I wish too. - It suits you. - Ustad: Jenny? What are you doing? Where's Tom? - In his room. - What's he doing there? I think he's packing. Will you go and tell him-- ( sighs ) No, leave it. I hate going back to Bombay. Soon we'll be going to bijapur. And there you will meet his guru. I can hardly wait. You will see how humble he is before his guru. That I must see. Want some? ( Train whistle blows ) ( Indistinct station announcements ) Don't worry, there's nothing about you in here. You still angry with me? You think I'm a big bully, don't you? I know I shout too much. I have a very bad temper. You can say that again. But only with those I love. Please understand. Why do you think I'm like this at all? Hmm? Heave off, you big whale. Are you going to leave me? Well, I got to sometime. There's an urdu poem. "Though your way lies here and mine there, "how can I ever remain apart from you since you are in the midst of my soul?" - Blimey. - ( Both chuckle ) ( Train whistle blows ) What is she like? Hmm? That one-- in benares. Well, it's difficult to say, really. Young? Beautiful? He's such a fool. At his age. - Does she talk about me? - Not to me. - Mummy! - Well, don't let her take my name in her mouth. I'm busy all day, on my head! (Kisses girl) Go. - Is she expecting? - I don't know. She will never have a son. I've taken steps. Mustani... Has given me something. See? Who am I to complain? It is his right. When they have taken our youth, then...somebody new. Is she very beautiful? Mm-hmm. Yes. When I was young... Do you think I was any less? ( Quietly sobs ) And there is that... English girl, also. - Jenny?! - He's such a fool! ( Crying ) ( Playing open stings repeatedly ) ( Both speaking hindi ) Girl: Mummy! - Mummy! - Ai! ( Jenny continues plucking stings ) ( Speaking hindi, making kissing noises ) ( Baby-talk ) ( Speaking hindi ) Sweetie? Sweetie? ( Continues muttering in hindi ) ( Kissing noises ) ( Continues, hindi ) ( Continues muttering in hindi ) ( Hindi ) Hmm? ( Laughing ) ( Laughter continues ) La la la la la la la la la la la la! ( Speaking hindi ) ( Whispering in hallway ) ( Whispering continues ) Let me in. Here. Hey, what's the matter? Have you had a bad dream? - Yes. - You're all trembly. - Feel my heart. - ( Whistles ) - Mmm. - Don't. Don't be so jumpy. Come on. Come here. That's it. ( Begum and ustad arguing in distance ) ( Shouting, crying ) ( Sobbing ) ( Ustad speaking hindi, begum crying ) ( Begum shouting, screaming ) ( Sobbing, screaming ) ( Shouting in hindi ) ( Speaking hindi ) ( Begum shrieks ) ( Screams ) ( Whimpering ) ( Horn honks ) - Tom. - Tom: Hmm? This is where the music festival is held. Isn't it beautiful? Does the maharaja still live here? His highness has built himself a new palace. No one comes here at all now, except for the music festival. Look in there. Come along now. Here, Jen! There are hundreds of rooms. Move that curtain and see. Who is it? An old maharaja. Where's Tom? - This door at the end? - ( Man speaking hindi ) Ah. There you are. Isn't this nice? - ( Men speaking hindi ) - What's he saying? He says a dancing girl was murdered here. Not recently; Long ago, 80, 90 years. She was all night with the maharaja's brother. In the morning, they found her dead here in this room. - What happened to him? - It was all hushed up. She was only a dancing girl, you see? Come, Tom. We must pay our respects to my ustad. Can't I come? He doesn't see ladies. Are you going to leave me here alone? Are you all right? You don't look it. She's sick. Can't you see? She's tired from the journey. Lie down and sleep. Come along, Tom. Are you okay? ( Speaking hindi ) ( Bell ringing in distance ) ( Bell continues ) Ustad: Sometimes he doesn't speak for days. You go see him and he sits like a stone. Tom: She's looking very terrible. Look, shouldn't she see a doctor? Well, shouldn't she? ( Train whistle blows, train chugging ) ( Coughing ) So, you have come. ( Coughs ) Have you brought sweets for me? I'll bring you some tomorrow, ustad. Who is he? He is from bijapur? No, he's English, ustad. Tell him to write petition for me in English. Maharaja must give more pension. How can I live on 80 rupees a month? I must have my hookah, my paan, my glass of milk in the morning. - Why is he here? - I've been teaching him our music, ustad. Jenny: Tom? What is it? It's that room. It's funny. She doesn't like to be left alone. I feel awful. I'm gonna get a doctor. Come on. Who was that? Uh, she is... She's with him. What sort of life you are leading? Look at you! Are you a musician? Or what are you? Running here and there, doing god knows what. Perhaps drinking also, with the English face, eh? - Why bring these people here? - They are my disciples, ustad. Is it possible for them to take even a drop from our ocean? Uh, I've been teaching them. To play tricks only. Go. ( Chuckling ) How fat you are. ( Coughing ) ( Muttering ) ( Distant chittering ) ( Distant parade music ) * ( Tambourine jingles ) ( Jingling continues ) ( Shrieks, laughs ) ( Parade music crescendo, stops ) ( Tuning sitar string ) ( Continues tuning ) ( Laughing ) Tom? Tom? - Hmm? - Ustad is asking for you. I can't come now. - But he wants you, Tom. - Not now! Is she all right? Doctor: She's going to be all right. What was all that, not worrying about germs and boiling the water, and really identifying? - Jenny: Oh, shut up. - ( Laughs ) Well, things like food and water don't affect me. Then why am I here? Don't forget, you people are not like US. We have natural immunity; You don't have. - I'll look in tomorrow. - Tom: Okay. There's nothing to worry about, then. Not to worry about. Only rice and curds. No curry. - And you'll be sending medicine around? - Yes, yes. - She should be all right in a couple of days. - Good. - Well, good-bye. - Thank you very much. Don't mention it. ( Singing, accompanied by sitar, tablas ) * ( lead singer trilling ) ( Singer trilling ) ( Trilling continues ) ( Sighs ) - What's the time? - It's almost 5:00. - Has he played yet? - No. Still some singers. Hey, you haven't had your medicine. I forgot. I hate taking that stuff. What time's he playing? I think he's next, but I'm not sure. Has he been in to see you yet? No. I suppose he's been too busy. You think I've been a real fool, running after him like that, don't you? Well, I've been doing the same. At least you've been learning. You can play.
