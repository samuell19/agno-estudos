Subtitles by explosiveskull [man] I think one of the most emotional moments of my life was the night that I was initiated into the Klan. I was led into the Klavern hall, which was dark. The only light that I could see was a fiery cross. And that... put me through the ceremony. Purified me with water. Laid his hand on my shoulder, says, "You're part of the Invisible Empire, United Klans of America." And there was a tremendous applause throughout the auditorium. And I came up off the floor really in tears. Because that's what I'd been looking for all my life. An opportunity to be heard, an opportunity to be something. [woman] I first told him, "Hell no!" [audience laughs] I would never, ever. But kill him, that's all I want. That was on my heart to kill him. This is the kind of reputation that I have in Durham. I'm not bragging about it, but it is the truth. You can call Durham, and they will tell you. Uh, no, I will not take no for an answer. I have to have the word "yes." Because all of our blood, when it comes out, is the same color. I haven't seen any blood different yet than the color of mine. And I'm sayin' whatever you believe in... I keep sayin' it... stand on it, baby, stand on it. [audience applauding] [crowd clamoring] [clamoring continues] [chanting] Equal housing now! Equal housing now! Equal housing now! [woman] They call this Magic City, Mr. Atkins. Ain't no magic here. Abe Greenfeld ain't nothin' but a vile slumlord. You know it, and I know it. And the black people of East Durham have the same rights as anybody else. This girl, Mr. Atkins, this young lady is a single mother of three children. And she wake up this morning to an eviction notice. But there's no hot water. What, baby, for two weeks? That's right, Miss A. Two weeks, and you say, what? No toilet? No toilet. No toilet. And that ain't no way for no human to live. [stifled laugh] Mr. Atkins, we done writin' letters here. We want to be heard before tomorrow night's ruling. Miss Atwater, you know our agenda is tight, and we simply cannot allot time to everybody that wants to speak. - [telephone rings] -Now thank you. Show yourselves out. Mr. Tucker, to what do I owe this pleasure? Sit down. [Atkins laughs] And a mighty fine afternoon to you, too. Now you listen to me, Councilman! And you too, Mr. Tucker! We ain't goin' nowhere until we get down to the brass tacks. You understand me? Everything all right here, Bill? Mr. Oldham, now we have been sitting here for over half an hour. - The councilman ain't done nothin' but... - Ann. Ann. We're gonna give you your chance to speak tomorrow night. Are we good now? [chuckles] Not yet. Come on. [insects buzzing] [man] Samuel Grace. Ayes? [all] Aye. Nays? Okay, then. Fred Eggert, Gene Waddle, and Samuel Grace are tentatively approved as new citizens of North Carolina Unit Nine of the Invisible Empire, United Klans of America. Kligraph is directed to certify the petitions and prepare the oaths for ceremony. Roy, next week should be fine. Final item. Combat and firearms training resumes this Saturday from noon to 4:00 under the supervision of second officer Floyd Kelly. And I'll remind the Youth Corps members that this training is mandatory. Y'all hear me? I'm talkin' to you. Yeah. [men chuckling] Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, give us strong minds, great hearts, true faith, and ready hands. Keep us unfettered from the world that we might fight the good fight and be worthy to claim the prize. May we as brethren and Klansmen be steadfast and unremovable. As we go hence from this Klavern into the struggle of the alien world, let us not forget the crowning glory of a Klansman is to serve. Non silba, sed anthar. [all] Not for self, but for others! Get him ready. Mm-hmm. You can say that again. He was born ready. Ready or not. Mr. Ellis? Oh, hey. This is, uh, this is the new boy I was telling you about. Oh, sure. Sure, sure. Sure, Ben. Come on in the office. I'll see you fellas. Have a seat. What's your name, son? [clears throat] Leonard, sir. Don't be nervous, Leonard. Ben here tells me you'd like to be a part of the Youth Corps. Yes. Yes, sir. Why do you want to be in the Youth Corps, Leonard? [clears throat] To help... To help protect the white race of America from the communist niggers and Jews who threaten us, sir. That's a good boy. [desk drawer opens] But that's not all. [drawer slides shut] It's our rights, our freedoms, our way of life that need protecting. We're an endangered species, Leonard. You understand? I do. Let me show you something. You see that? One day, this will be your most prized possession. It will give you everything you need in your life. Brotherhood, standing in the community, and a sense of pride that you're part of something bigger than yourself. But most importantly, it will be a reminder every day that you will no longer be an outsider. [box shuts] Welcome to the Youth Corps, Leonard. [knocking] We gonna take care of that thing? Yeah. Ben, bring the car around, out back. [engine off] Now what? We wait. [man chuckling] [radio: man singing ballad] [humming along] [song continues on radio, muffled] [engine off] [car door opens] [dog howls] She got a nigger boyfriend. [lighter clicks] The neighbors have been complaining. Stay here. [song continues] Wait for the light, Wiley. [screams] [chorus vocalizing, fading out] [telephones ringing] [typewriters clacking] [sighs] Hey. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Miss Dupree. Miss Dupree... Yes, I know, Miss Dupree, but... Hold on, Miss Dupree. Miss Dupree says she can't make it. Her kids... Oh, no. Come here. Cissy, you better get your ass down to City Hall tonight. No, no, I don't want to hear that. I have been a single mother ever since I was 16, and that's a whole hell of a lot longer than you. - [chuckles] -Well, child, it's supposed to be hard. Are you gonna be there later tonight or what? I better see your face lookin' black and angry. Mm-hmm. Who's next? [bell dings] Hey, Jeb, I'll take this one. [Jeb] Sure, Mr. Ellis. Finish up that tire for me, will you? All right. Can you fill the place tonight? You know I can, Carvie. What's up? We're ruling on Greenfeld tonight. Ann Atwater and all her Operation Breakthrough niggers are gonna make a scene. I just need numbers. Jesus. Greenfeld. You gonna help that scum? [Carvie chuckles] You know, C.P.... Reelection here. He got deep pockets. I need to at least appear supportive. And you need to keep your friends on the city council. [car door opens, closes] I know, Carvie. We'll be there. [soul plays; hands clapping] [song continues] [song stops] [C.P.] Oh, you late. Yeah. I guess that's what they call Africa time. [men laugh] [female clerk] First item on the docket. In the matter of the Edgemont community housing, the council will first hear from Mr. Paulsen, representing Mr. Greenfeld. [spectators groaning, murmuring] Good evening. As you know, Mr. Greenfeld prides himself on providing comfortable housing at affordable rent to a great many people in Durham. [murmuring] [gavel raps] The council will hear Mr. Paulsen. As with any dwelling, from time to time, there undoubtedly will be some... wear and tear. - [laughing, scoffing] -Mr. Greenfeld fully intends to address any of these issues that these folks might have. However, with the recent inclement weather, Mr. Greenfeld has had insufficient time to get to everyone. That's a lie. [gavel raps] We ask that the council grant us the 90-day extension for these minor repairs. Thank you. Miss Atwater? Uncomfortable housing and unaffordable rent are about the only two things Abe Greenfeld has ever given us. [exclaiming, applauding] Now, I have here with me 79 written complaints from the residents of Edgemont. Each and every last one of them is a code violation. [exclaiming, applauding] [gavel raps] I brought 'em here with me 'cause, obviously, you ain't get 'em the first couple times when they were sent here. [exclaiming, applauding] [gavel raps] Order! Now we are fed up with this man and his eviction notices and his rent hikes. He has absolutely no care for his tenants' living conditions. We humans. Humans shouldn't have to live like this. [clamoring] [gavel rapping] Thank you for your comments, Miss Atwater. And I will personally pass those complaints on to the housing commission for future review. At this time, the council will grant the requested 90-day extension. Thank you all. This council will now stand in recess till next week. Bye. [woman] Put down that paper, Claiborne. Put it down. All right. Okay, Mama. Daddy. Huh? Hey, it's time to visit with your children. Claiborne! I'm visiting. I-I... I'm visiting. How's your marks, Tim? [mother] Tim, answer your father. I'm gettin' an "F" in math. That's 'cause you're stupid. Hey! Well, I know it ain't for a lack of trying, son. Maybe your teacher can give you a little extra time after school. I don't think this teacher. Why not? She said I just ain't got a head for numbers, Daddy. She said that don't matter, though. Said I'll just work in the gas station with you when I grow up. Yeah. Maybe this teacher ain't so smart. I'm gonna stop in at Murdock this morning before I go in. See your brother. - Give him a kiss for us, Daddy. - You bet. I don't like that place. That's 'cause it's full of weirdos and retards. Kenneth Wade! Don't be calling your brother that. I wasn't talking about him. - He just ain't as lucky as you is all. - That's right. I'm sorry. You be sorry cleanin' that table. Yes, sir. I better go. Give me some sugar, sugar. Bye, Daddy. [Ann] Let's go, girls. Move your backsides. Marilynn. Marilynn! Girl, you forgot your lunch. You'd forget your head if it wasn't attached to your shoulders. Go on now. [nurse] Hey, come on. Help me out here. Come on. No. You gotta help me out here. Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy. It's Daddy. How you doing, pumpkin? You have breakfast yet? Pancakes this morning. Oh! Hey, buddy, that's your favorite. Thank you. You got eggs and maple syrup. [humming "Oh My Darlin' Clementine"] Supposed to cut this up ahead of time. He can't swallow all this. There you go. There you go. So you must multiply the three on this side by two. But remember, whatever you do to the bottom, you must do to the top, right? Good. So, I want you to go ahead, work out the equations that I gave you. Let's do the next one, let's see what you come up with. All right? [metallic creaking] [alarm bell ringing] [children screaming, shouting] [woman] Don't... [coughing] [sirens approaching] Over here. Come on. [rings] Ann Atwater. Hey, baby. [Marilynn] Mama! Oh! Thank God. [exhales] Are you okay? I'm okay. Okay, baby. You go wait in the car. I'll be right there. Is anybody hurt? Everyone's okay. Just lots of smoke. How did it start? [man] Most likely electrical, the way they keep this place up. Or it could've been set on purpose. No. Klan ain't that stupid. [man] Why do you say that? When a black school burns, then... Then what? Then the black kids gotta find a new school. [laughter] Turns out, he left the thing in neutral. It rolls right back into the ravine. They didn't find that truck for two weeks. Oh, are you talking about how small your pecker is again, Wiley? [laughter] That ain't funny, Doreen. Yeah, it ain't that kind of funny. That's for sure. [song on jukebox, muffled] [laughing] [Floyd] You-You wait... The guy's got one arm. C.P. Garland... Garland Keith, my friend. You're out late. You wanna have a seat? No, thank you. Gentlemen. Well, something must be awfully important for you to lower yourself to come to a dump like this, Garland. Floyd, come on now. No, no. Mm-mmm. I like the White Citizens' Council, with their parade floats and their fancy country club meetings. I'm always honored to mop up after 'em, do the dirty work. You'll have to excuse Mr. Kelly. It's been a long week. [Garland] Sorry to say it's about to get a bit longer. There was a fire out at East End Elementary today. So what? It's a black school. The parents have already filed a petition to allow the students to finish out the year at Durham Elementary School. There's an emergency council meeting tomorrow. Well... Ann Atwater? I think so. [C.P.] This ain't no small landlord dispute, Garland. We gonna need everybody on this one. Well, that's why I'm here, C.P. Were you scared? A little. [sighs] It's gonna be all right, okay? All right, baby? You get some rest. Try to go to sleep, okay? You warm enough? [Marilynn] Mm-hmm. [kisses, chuckles] Mama? Mm-hmm? Where are we gonna go to school now? Don't you worry about a thing, okay? Mama gonna find you somewhere real nice to go. Say your prayers. [male reporter] The fire was strictly limited to the building's facilities and perhaps equipment. [man] I know your first appearance here, you can't make an opinion... I'm not gonna have them kids going to Tim's school. Mmm. Well, they gonna put 'em somewhere. Ain't gonna be in Durham Elementary. Tim having enough trouble without more distractions. May have to look into one of them private schools outside of town. Oh, yeah. How we gonna pay for that? I'm workin' on it. It ain't gonna work until you start sellin' gas to the other half of Durham. What's that supposed to mean? You know what it means. That's not fair. Oh, fair. Hey. Come on. It's not fair, it's a fact. It's not fair 'cause you know I can't. How's it gonna look if the president of the Klan is puttin' gasoline in a nigger's car? How's it gonna look to my Klan folk? Oh. Oh, I see. I... I didn't know that the Klan pays your bills. I didn't think so. [groans] Here we go. You spend all that time at Klavern hall jaw-jackin' about them niggers and them commies and them Jews. - I don't sound like that. - Yeah, you do. Give me some... Eww! Claiborne Ellis, you smell like beer. I'm not gonna have them kids going to our school. This emergency council meeting was called late last night after an apparent electrical fire destroyed nearly half of East End Elementary School. They've been in session for nearly three hours now. [spectators chattering] This council is facing some difficult decisions. Tonight, we've had to consider how these decisions will affect the students of not one school, but two. We've heard testimony from the marshal that eight classrooms and three common areas, including the gymnasium, were unaffected by the fire. Unaffected? Hey. Have you been to the school? She's breakin' the rules. No, no. Ain't nobody talkin' to you, C.P., so shut your mouth. - Miss Atwater, you've had your time. - I've seen the school. And if that marshal says that school is habitable for children... Miss Atwater, you have had your time. ...then he's just lyin' or he just plain stupid! - [C.P.] Why don't you shut up? - Don't make no sense. - [gavel raps] - [clamoring] [man] Shut up! We will have quiet in the chamber! - [clamoring quiets] -Now what we talkin' about is important, and you're gonna damn well listen to us, Mr. Steele. [Carvie] Miss Atwater. Miss Atwater. Kindly take your seat before I have a deputy remove you. Now then... it is the opinion of this council that there remain two basic questions. One, is East End a safe and habitable place for its students to finish their school year? And two, would the students of Durham Elementary be unfairly burdened by the sudden and massive influx of new students? Our answer to both of these questions... is yes. [scattered applause] With the limited number of classrooms that remain at East End, the students will be put on a split-shift system. One from 7:00 a.m. to noon, the other from noon to 5:00. [cameraman] We're good. I got it. [man] Miss Atwater? Who the hell are you? Miss Atwater, we're from the NAACP. [male reporter] WDNC news time, 9:00 a.m. Recapping our top story, the NAACP's legal action is causing quite a stir inside the county's district court, one source saying he would not want to be in Judge Les Hallford's shoes this morning. - [woman] Good morning, Your Honor. - [sighs] [Hallford exhales] - Is that it? - Just arrived. Full and immediate integration of all Durham public schools. [Hallford exhales] Get Wilbur Hobby in here. Yes, sir. You've passed things down before. Ah, you know I can't do that. These idiots just sent kids back into a school that's still smokin'. I pass it down, it's the same as ruling against. I know. I just wanted to make sure you knew that. I asked you here for your counsel, Wilbur, not a lecture. Sorry. [exhales] What if you held off, delayed your ruling? [scoffs] Delaying the inevitable, that's all that would be. No. You delay to allow the people of Durham to reach their own decision. I'm not following, Wilbur. [exhales] - I know a guy. - [chuckles] You know a guy? Yes, I know a guy. He runs a department at Shaw University down in Raleigh. He does this thing. Uh, he holds charrettes. Cha-what? They're kind of, uh, these official community summits with people from both sides of the problem. They're called charrettes. He's had some pretty good results. Wilbur, get this guy of yours up here. [phone rings] Bill? Wilbur Hobby's on the phone. Wilbur Hobby. Why does this phone call worry me? [chuckles] Well, what a coincidence. I was hoping it would worry you. [Bill laughs] How are you, Wilbur? Looks like you're havin' some trouble up there. Well, nothing a heavy dose of Bill Riddick can't solve. Hello? Look, Bill, I, uh... I heard York went well. York, Pennsylvania, isn't Durham, North Carolina, Wilbur. Well, all the more reason we need you. Look, you're the only one that does this. Besides, it'll get you outta the house. Delores even said you're driving her crazy. [chuckles] We've been drivin' each other crazy. All right, Wilbur. All right. Great. - I'll see you in a few hours, Bill. - A... A few hours? [dial tone] Hello? Now, I've asked Bill Riddick here to conduct a ten-day community charrette so that the citizens of Durham can finally come to a resolution on the school integration question. The city council will abide this resolution and enact the will of the people. That gutless fool. Abide? Abide? It's not even defined. He's making us define it. What are we gonna say to the press? Nothing. At least not till we get a legal opinion. And in the meantime, what in good Christ is a charrette? [man singing pop song] [continues on radio] [continues, indistinct] [bell dings] Uh, yeah, we don't sell gasoline to niggers here. I'm not looking for a fill-up. Mr. Ellis? My name is Bill Riddick. Yeah? Uh... Wilbur Hobby suggested I... - Wilbur Hobby sent you here? - Yeah. He said I should come see you, yeah. He said you represent a great many people in this town. He'd be right about that. Well, Mr. Ellis, I've been asked to organize a charrette. I read the newspaper. Oh. So then you know... Hold on. Are you here to ask me to come to your, uh, integration meetings? Well, for now, just lunch. Lunch? Tomorrow. With, uh... with me and with Ann Atwater. Come again? Well, I was hoping you'd come to lunch with me and Ann Atwater. - Ann Atwater? - Ann Atwater. [stifled laugh] What did Wilbur Hobby think I'd say to that? Well, he thought you would say no. - He'd be right about that, too. - Well, see here, Mr. Ellis... You're not from around here, Mr.... Riddick. ...so I'll help you out. Folks in this town, and especially me, want niggers to stay in their own schools. That's definitely one of the options, Mr. Ellis. But right now, I'm gonna leave you my card. The local number is on the back. You change your mind... Boy, you better get on outta here. Go on, git. Like I told you. Mr. Ellis, I hope you reconsider. This charrette is happening. So, uh, if you truly represent your people... represent them. Have a good day. [Carvie] We know this makes you uncomfortable, C.P. But goddamn it, it's the best thing that could have happened. "Uncomfortable" isn't exactly the word I'd use for it, Carvie. C.P., what do you think would happen if a lily-white liberal was in there instead of you? Nothing good. A liberal and Ann Atwater would pass integration faster than a hot knife through butter. That's what don't make no sense. [Steele] What don't? This Riddick nigger wants school integration, right? So why me? Why put that on himself? I shoulda been the last person on his list. C.P., this judge... Our hands may be tied. But it won't matter if we have a friend on the inside. And especially if that friend is C.P. Ellis. Oh, Charlie, I... He's about to hand you the keys to school integration, and you're going to lock the door. [softly singing hymn] - Hey! How you doin'? How your dad doin'? - [man] Good. How late is he? Twenty minutes. C.P. comin' to have lunch with two niggers. [scoffs] He'd just as soon shoot us than do that. Y'all northern folks just don't get it. I'm from North Carolina, Ann. Oh, yeah? Where about? Hertford County. That still north of here. He's here. [Ann] Here he go. Would you look at that crazy white man? Just pacing back and forth. I ain't waitin' for that cracker. I'm hungry. Mr. Ellis? Please, come sit down. Well, uh, okay. Um, thank you both for coming. Hopefully, this is a first step... Hey, I'm not gonna sit here one minute longer than I have to, so... Well, go on and git, then. That way, me and Bill can have a civilized conversation. [scoffs] Mr. Ellis, um, I'm holding a steering committee meeting here on Saturday. And I've invited people who represent all types of citizens in this community. All types? Only two types in this town. Well, whites, black, liberals, conservatives. For a charrette to be successful, we need to bring together a large number of diverse people. [scoffs] The only folk he gonna bring, they gonna be wearing sheets and hoods. Ain't that right, C.P.? [stammers] Hold on. If you already have a meeting set, what the hell am I doing sitting here? Well, you're here, both of you... because I need two co-chairs to lead the charrette. [laughs] I'm gonna think about it, you know, 'cause I wouldn't want your type takin' over this, uh... what'd you call it? Charade? [laughs] I don't know what you're up to either. I don't like it. You could use me for my help. That's fine. But I am not gonna work with that cracker. So you need to look somewhere else. This corn bread is good. [woman] I would love it. [people chattering] Let me help you clear this. It was delicious. Very nice of you. Thank you. You outdid yourself, Mrs. Keith. Oh, well, thank you. Ten days is a long time with them people, Garland. It's also a long time for them to be making decisions on integration without us having a voice. That's not gonna make it any easier to sell to my people. Well, you're their president, C.P. You just make 'em understand. Hell, it says so right there in your Klan Creed: "Failure to know your enemy gives them aid and comfort" and all that. I mean, the truth is, C.P., we... we don't know the enemy at all. Do we? You're yankin' on the trigger too hard. Trick is to think of it as pressin' the trigger, not pullin' on it. Ten-hut! Y'all heed this man, now. Mr. Kelly here's an expert. He even knows that word for when you breathe out 'fore you shoot. What's that called again? Respiratory pause. [men laugh] See? What'd I tell ya? All right, one more, then next up. [man] All right. You didn't care too much for that conversation last night. Well, when it's me and you, it's fine. I ain't much for talking in mixed company. Well, we do need people there, Floyd. And Carvie asked me personally, so... Yeah, I know it, C.P. And I'll back you up on it. But, uh... be careful. Careful of what? If you wrestle with a pig... [gun cocks] ...you gonna get muddy. [Bill] Meeting these benchmarks successfully will depend entirely on the dedication and enthusiasm of this steering committee. And, uh, we haven't got much time to get organized, so priority one will be to get the word out and to recruit as many citizens as possible to come and participate. All right, before we go any further, we need to elect our two co-chairs. I nominate Ann Atwater... and C.P. Ellis. But he's a Klansman. And we're talking about integration. Uh, Mr. Riddick, I already done told you I won't work with that man. [scoffs] That'd be just fine with me. Everybody know it would be just fine with you, C.P. Just hold on a minute now, Ann. I'd like to hear from C.P. on this. Mr. Ellis. Well, I'm not in the habit of interviewing for a job that I don't really want. But you're asking, so I'll tell you. Everybody talkin' about nigras want this, nigras need that. This whole thing started 'cause of what nigras are demanding. What about white folks? What about what we want? You already got everything you want. No, we don't. Now the niggers in this town are trying to take away everything we got left. They don't want us to play "Dixie" at our schools. That's our song. They're angry when we fly the Confederate flag at ball games. And why should one of our boys have to play ball under that flag? That flag is our proud Southern history. It might be your proud Southern history, C.P., but it sure as hell ain't ours. [C.P.] All right. Integrated schools have "blacks only" assemblies, "blacks only" Martin Luther King this, that. That ain't my history. You wanna talk about schools? Let's talk about schools, Mr. Riddick. My sons don't have it easy in school. Their teachers ain't even teachin' them half the time. And you want to throw them together with a bunch of nigras? It's only gonna get worse for them. You ask why? I'm here to protect my boys. So all the better if she don't get in my way. I'll sit with you, Brother Ellis. [murmuring] Howard, have you lost your everlasting mind, callin' that man your brother? [Bill] You're offering to co-chair, Howard? Uh, I am. And that's an honest man right there, Ann. The only honest man that's stood up today. He hates me. [chuckles] And he told me why. But then he opened up his heart about his sons. Why is he agreeing with me? - I don't know. - [Howard] That means he's my brother. [whispers] Did that nigger just call me brother? [laughs] Y'all hear that? I'll tell you what you are, Howard. You one of them "big niggers," ain't you? You done went up north and got your college degree, your fancy cars, and your fancy suits. Meanwhile, we down here on the ground gettin' dirty. Now wait a minute, Ann. The Black Solidarity Committee has been working within this community... Oh, shut up, Howard! You're late to the fight! And you have no idea what real black folk go through. You don't deserve a seat. He don't deserve that chair, he don't. Callin' that man his brother. So are you saying you'll accept now, Miss Atwater? [shutter clicks] ['70s rock plays] [song continues] [indistinct] I'm going to continue to fight for us white working men even if I have to sit in a room with that awful Ann Atwater to do it. [cheering, applauding] C.P. Ellis don't scare me. We gonna beat school segregation once and for all. Well, she's livin' in her own fantasy world. Folks in this town like things the way they are. [singing "Happy Birthday"] [song ends] [exhales] [woman] Good morning, Mr. Ellis. Co-chair office is just around the corner. Thank you. All I'm saying is our children are way behind. Almost a full year. [woman] Well, just havin' white teachers isn't gonna help them catch up. [Ann] White teachers? They already got some white teachers. It ain't that. It's about the books. Newer books don't account for a whole year. Newer ain't got nothing to do with it. Baby, what's your name? In the red shirt. What's your name? Miles. [Ann] Miles. What year did you just finish, Miles? My junior year. Mm-hmm. And what year were your books for? The textbooks were for the tenth-graders, ma'am. [scoffs] [murmuring, applauding] Well, how's that gonna work? How's what gonna work, C.P.? You gonna put a bunch of black kids who are a year behind... with white kids who aren't. How you gonna teach that class? You can't. It just ain't possible. So you go ahead and get the right books, but you can't teach that class, no way. No way. [murmuring] Okay. So tomorrow, we'll break into our smaller groups and begin hammering out the different resolution points. But we meet back here each night for wrap-up. Also, you've noticed these, uh, two tables up here on the stage. Along with Mr. Ellis and Miss Atwater, ten more of you will be chosen to fill these seats as part of our senate. That senate will vote on the resolutions on the final night of the charrette. Okay. Unless there's anything else, I think we could all use some sleep. Yes, Reverend? Mr. Riddick, it's been quite a tense day. It may be wise if we have some positive note to end each session. Something to lift our spirits. I think that's a good idea, Reverend. What did you have in mind? Well, I notice we have a piano over here. What if we all sing gospel music at the end of each night? - Okay. - [man] Nigger music. [crowd murmurs] What did you say? I believe he said that's nigger music. Gospel music don't have nothing to do with black or white. It's about God. Praise God, but he... he's right. Gospel music is absolutely for black folk. I'm a bit surprised that the reverend would suggest something so one-sided. I'm a little disappointed. [Bill] Okay. I can appreciate that, C.P. These people would like gospel music. So, uh, how would you like to represent your people? Well, I'd like to display our Klan materials here at the charrette. [spectators murmuring] Klan materials? Mm-hmm. It's not the same thing. I know that. We can't let him do it. That stuff's full of hate. That's all it is. He gave on the gospel. I don't give a damn what he gave on. Well, he gave, so we give. Bill Riddick, if that stuff shows up here, it's gonna be a riot. And you can bet your ass I'm gonna be the one leading the charge. Oh, you gonna get all Roughhouse Annie on me now, huh? Yeah, I heard tell about you. All talkin' and no listenin'. We're here trying to understand each other for once and stop fighting. I'll stop fightin' when there ain't nothing left to fight for. Then you gonna be goin' uphill the rest of your life, Ann. In the meantime, I'm-a keep that man here talkin' as long as I possibly can. [sighs] [Bill] C.P. C.P. This, um, display you want to bring. We're willing to go along with it. But there'll be folks not wild about the sight of it. So, uh, you're gonna need to provide some security, someone to watch over it. I'm not gonna be responsible for it. [blows] This is my security. That gun don't belong here. I like to have it close in case I need it to do my talkin' for me. This here does the talkin' for me. I have a Bible. Oh, you do? Have you read it? Course I've read it. Even go to church on Sundays. [Ann] Hmm. Well, then, you ought to know, C.P. Know what? Same God made you, made me. That's everything, Mr. Ellis. Looks good, Ben. Real good. Thank you, Mr. Ellis. Divided according to race. Uh, six black, six white. The senate members will float in and out of different working groups, observing and participating. On the final night of the charrette, you will vote to either adopt or reject the resolutions presented to you. So, we're the final word? Final word, Howard. Two-thirds majority to pass each resolution. Eight votes to pass? Then we should be able to handpick the other four white members. Well, then, we might as well go on home then. C.P., that's not practical. We need to be as fair as possible. I'm gonna have to side with my friend here. I mean, we can surely all agree that every Negro in the building is gonna vote yes on school integration. That's six automatic votes, no matter what. Same's not true for every last white person. There's a bunch of liberals sittin' out there right now. Look, there are four prominent organizations represented in this room, right here. The Klan, The White Citizens' Council, Black Solidarity Committee, and Operation Breakthrough. You each get your votes. You want fair? We'll pick eight regular members. Regular. No black power people, no Klan. They're excluded. Agreed? None of her people? [Bill] No. And none of y'all. Hey! What do you think you doing, huh? Leave that alone. Boys need to be reading this instead of ripping it up. The Klan is givin' you a window to look through. You need to read this stuff and understand it. That way, you understand them. Okay? You got the upper hand. Got it? Get on outta here, Charles. Give me that. Should tell your daddy. You know better. [exhales] Kids don't make no sense... "...professional experts from in the community and from outside will stand by listening, learning." [continues reading, indistinct] Ann? Ann? What? Where are you going? I'm going home. Look, I know you're upset, Ann. You don't know nothing! I told you it was a damn fool idea to let that man bring that stuff in here. Ain't no good gonna come from it! And I'll tell you something else, Bill Riddick. You an even bigger fool if you think you gonna make any change with this here meeting. Is that right? That's right. 'Cause as long as the C.P. Ellises of the world keep gettin' their way, ain't nothing gonna change. Yeah, you talk about Roughhouse Annie? Keep Uncle Tommin' that cracker and you gonna see Roughhouse Annie. Go on back up north where you belong, 'cause you don't know nothing. Marion Wilson. Okay. The other bowl now. [Garland] Sam Watford. Is that Scooter Watford's boy? [Horace] Yeah. You won't have a problem there. [C.P.] You sure? Pretty sure. I remember he kept losin' jobs during them boycotts. Still pretty sore about it. I don't like that mustache, tell you what. All right. Earl Weeks. [laughs] He's... He's with us. [Garland] How do you know? He been a deacon at my church since I was a kid. He don't like nobody. - That's a good man. - Two for two. Okay, we gonna have an issue with this gal Maddy Mays. The blonde over by the window. [Garland] Yeah, she's a nurse. [C.P.] Yeah, over at Durham Clinic. Real "people person." I think that's one to worry about. Last is Lee Trombley. [groans] Trombley Hardware. Off of Route Nine. What do we know? [sighs] I don't know 'bout him, C.P. Might be a problem there. He took over after his daddy passed. Family man, two kids, I think. [C.P.] And? [Horace] Everybody that works for him is a nigger. Every one. And they all thick as thieves. [taps notebook] All right, I guess it's time we get acquainted with Lee Trombley. Can I help you, sir? Uh... Lee around? No, sir. He's not here right now. But I'm the manager. Something I can help you with? Uh, no. Um... I'll come back another time. [door opens] - [thunder rumbles] - [rain pattering] Okay. Any thoughts, uh, insights? You don't have to raise your hand, Maddy. I think it's nice to see people talking for once. That ain't talkin'. It's yellin'. Well, okay. It's arguing. But people are listening to one another. They really are. [Sam] They're arguing. I've been listening to it for days, and still no one's answered how integration's gonna help my kids. - It sure can't hurt 'em. - It sure as hell can. - I'd like to know how. - Well, for one, I don't want my daughter sitting next to a Negro boy in class. I don't want her eatin' next to one, and don't want her being at a school dance with one. So, you care about your daughter? And you don't want to see her get hurt. What's your point? My point is that is what we do as parents. When they're little, we try to keep them from touching the stove so they don't burn. We teach them to take small bites so they don't choke. We worry about their first day at school, the first time they drive a car, their very first job. See, we want them to avoid the pain that we experienced. [chuckles] All right. All right. We all gonna sit around, hold hands, sing "Kumbaya"? - We see what you're doing, Howard. - And what is that, C.P.? That there's no difference between blacks and whites, right? 'Cause we all worry about our kids. We're all the same, right? Actually, no, C.P. We're not. See, I left some things out. I left out that black folks have a whole different menu of pain to worry about. Our kids get spit on for no reason. Our kids have to move on the sidewalk to let white folks pass, or they get beat. Our kids aren't allowed to sit where they want, play where they want, go to school where they want. See, this is the pain they experience every day that we, we can't... can't spare them from. And that is a... It's a helpless feeling. A more helpless feeling than you could ever know. I fell right into that one. Yeah. Shit. You see Trombley's face? Yeah. Did you get anywhere with Trombley last night? He wasn't there. They were right, though. He got a black manager. Well, where we gonna get him, then? Right now. We gonna crowd him at lunch. Mmm. [Bill] Okay. Everybody listen up. We're going to be trying something different today. There are name cards at each seat in this lunchroom. This will be your seat for the rest of the charrette. You may not move your name card. And you guessed it, the person sitting next to you will not be the same color as you. - What? - And... And no discussion of issues during this hour. Talk about something else. [no audible dialogue] [Ann singing softly] [Ann clears throat] I just can't do it. Mm-mm. Mm-mm! Mm-mm-mm. These fish sticks is dry. Well... Hmm. If we can't change anything else, we can sure demand better school lunches, huh? We're not supposed to talk about issues. I guess you're right. Howard... Howard was wrong in there, weren't he? Wrong? Mm-hmm. Well, I mean, he weren't wrong about what black kids go through. But... He was wrong about you not knowing what helpless is, weren't he? What does that mean? You got a boy out at Murdock, don't you, C.P.? - I don't wanna talk about that. - I'm just trying... Ann, don't talk about my son. Don't ever talk about my son. Okay. [guitar plays] [man humming] [man singing country folk] We're willing to go to summer school, even nights, just to catch up with the white students. Good Lord never intended for blacks to have equal rights. [song continues] [song ends] Daddy! What's wrong? What's wrong, sugar? It's Larry. [boy screaming] What's goin' on? - Who is this? - [nurse] Alvin. He moved in Friday. Hey, hey. Shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh. [screaming continues] Hey, pumpkin. [grunting] [C.P.] Go! It's okay. [nurse] It's okay. [C.P.] No monster. No monster, son. No monster. I got your book. I'm gonna read... Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh. [girl] It's Vickie. Read to him. Okay. Come here, pumpkin. I'll be right back. - Vickie's gonna read to you. - It's your sister, Vickie. Get him out. Hey, who's in charge here? Can I help you, Mr. Ellis? No. Is there someone else I can talk to? One moment. Hey. [bell dinging] Hey. [nurse] I'll be right there. I need help. No, sir. No, sir. I need help. My son needs help. Step outside that door. I need to get my son out of that room. Yes, sir. Step outside for a moment. Now calm it down. I need to get my son out of that room. Your son is gonna be just fine. He's scared. He's not fine. He needs to be moved. Right away. Or that other one needs to be moved. My son's scared. Look. Look. It's important that our patients stay in familiar surroundings. 'Cause if they're moved too often, they get agitated... A private room then. [stammers] Give Larry a private room, please. We have regulations here at Murdock. I don't care about your regulations. Now you move him, or I will. How's that? No, you will not. Mr. Ellis! Call security right now. You calm yourself down. [exhales] God... How much... How much is it again? A private room is $75 more per week. Now do you wanna pay for that? I got 16. Mr. Ellis. Listen to me. Larry will get used to it, all right? You shoulda told me. No one told me that boy would be in this room. It was... No one told me. It was a last minute... You shoulda told me. [slaps counter] [man speaking, indistinct] [C.P.] You know, I'm tryin' to tell you now. His roommate was wailin' and screamin' and... But they wouldn't let me move him. I wanna take him home. He's better off with us. He don't belong there. He ain't like them others. Yes, Claiborne, he is. I'm seeing him tomorrow. I'm sure he's fine. You okay? Yeah, I'm just tired. I'll see you at home. I love you. [people chattering] [people singing gospel, muffled] [singing continues] [clapping hands to song] [singing gospel] [singing fades] [woman on P.A., indistinct] Can I help you? You can't, but Bernadette can. One moment. Thank you. Miss Atwater! [chuckles] Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. How have you been? Oh, baby, I've been good. How about yourself? I'm fine. I'm just fine. Well, what can I help you with? Where's that Larry Ellis boy? [Alvin murmuring] Bernadette. Yes, Miss Atwater? I'm gonna need a favor. But that's not fair. I know it's not fair, honey. But I went back and looked. Not even half of them are done yet. But she never does any of her charts. She always expects us to do them for her. You and I have to go over all her work, or it's gonna be on us. [Alvin humming] Hello? Hello? Where's Larry? Where's my son? He's not in his room. What happened? Nothing happened, Miss Ellis. He was moved. [radio: woman singing ballad] It's so nice. Hey, baby. It's your mama. Hey, baby, it's your mama. - Hi. - Hi. Let's put on some music. [volume increases] [song fades] What? No, no, it's good. It's... It's just, uh... All right, I'll see you at home. I want to talk to you. Finally. Look. What you, uh... [sighs] I didn't... I... I didn't ask for your help. I can take care of my own family, okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. It's just what I do, C.P. Well, whatever is you do, don't do it for me. I didn't do it for you. [sighs] - Strike one! - Yeah, Chester, bring the heat! All right, shut your hole. That ain't helping. Don't pay him no mind, boy. He ain't goin' nowhere with two outs. They'll hold 'em. Be all right. [bottle opens] I'll be right back. [bat hits ball] [cheering] Your boy playing today? Oh. Mr. Ellis. Uh, no. My nephew. You can call me C.P. You want a beer? Oh. Thanks. [umpire] Strike! So, how do you think it's going? The charrette. Um... It's interesting. It's nice to hear both sides, you know. Yeah. Yeah. We got some decisions to make. [umpire] Strike three! You're out! [scattered cheering] Say, that nigger fella? The one that comes, uh... He runs your hardware store? Yeah. 'Bout two years now. His name's Emmett. And you trust him to... to run things? Sorry, I-I'm just curious. I don't think I could trust one of them to run my filling station. Other than my wife, he's the only person I trust. How's that? Well, he and I, we... We were in Vietnam together. Oh. You were in Vietnam? Yeah. Two tours. Got out in '68. You? No. No, I... No. Yeah. Well, look, Mr. Ellis, I know who you are. And I know what you want from me. But I just don't... No, no, Lee. Any man who served bravely in this country's military doesn't need to hear anything more from me. You vote how you want to. I'll respect it. Mr. Ellis? Emmett served this country, too. And he was a lot braver than me. [bat hits ball] [scattered cheering] All right, folks. For our last day, I thought we'd go on a little field trip. Where to? You gotta vote Monday night. I think it's important we get a firsthand look at what we've been talkin' about the past few weeks. [Bill] I know it's been a long day, but this is the last one. Please be careful. Watch your step. [Ann] Ain't no better over here. It's a mess. They gotta keep the doors open because of the smell. I imagine so. It helps. [children chattering] Lot of kids for summer school. Uh... That ain't summer school, C.P. They still tryin' to finish up from last year. Yes, because of the split shifts after the fire, the students were really only getting about three hours of schooling per day. So, they're still catching up. Hey, how you doin'? Did you get them shoes I sent you? Mama! [chuckles] Hey. Oh, this your girl? Hey. Hi. Marilynn, this here is, uh, Mr. Ellis. Oh. Well, I better get to class. Okay. [exhales] She looked at me like I was some kind of monster. What'd you expect? I don't know. I'm trying to do right by us. Make it all better. And how's this gonna make it all better? Hell, I'm... [scoffs] They wanted to integrate restaurants. So we did. Then came buses and bathrooms and playgrounds. Look, I'm over there right now supporting more funding to make their schools better. If they have nicer schools, they'll... [kicks cabinet] ...stop pushin' to integrate ours. The one thing we have left. Then maybe we'll all stop fighting. Then what you gonna do? What? When everybody stops fighting, who you gonna fight? [doorbell rings] [Ann] Okay. Coming. Can I help you? Hi, Ann. Um... I'm Mary Ellis. Claiborne's wife. Oh. I'm sorry for just dropping by. I, um... I wanted to thank you for, um, what you did for our family, for our son Larry. Please, come in. Thanks. Go on in. Hope you like sweet tea. I do. So Larry is doing better, huh? He is. You know, sometimes it's hard to... keep him calm. Mm. Well, has, uh... has Larry always been like that? Yeah. You know, when he was little, it just... He started not to be able to do things. [chuckles] Has C.P. always been like that? [Mary] Oh. [both laugh] Yes. More or less. You know, he used to be a really good baseball player. Really? Showed a lot of promise. Colleges came and looked at him right over here at Liberty Park. Where we met, actually. Came up to me, he's so nervous. Couldn't even talk. So handsome. Oh. [laughing] What? C.P. handsome? Oh. He was. Okay. Mm-hmm. Oh. Thank you again. You're welcome. Ann... Yes? Claiborne is, uh... He's doing the best he can. Bye. Good-bye, Miss Ellis. [gunfire] Gimme a minute with C.P., would you? Sure thing, Floyd. [gunfire continues] Hey. What do you say, Floyd? You got one of those? See the paper? Nothin' I could do about that. All part of this charrette business. It don't look right. It don't matter what it looks like, Floyd. Matters what it is. Oh, yeah. Your wife making friends with Ann Atwater what it is? What? Couple of the boys saw 'em today. How am I supposed to explain that? She did something for Larry is all. Mary was just probably thanking her. Niggers is doing you favors now, C.P.? Stop with the bullshit, Floyd. Mary's always gone her own way. Has nothin' to do with how I do my business. Never has. Now you got something to say? Say it. Look around you, C.P. All these guys, they look up to you. They need you. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm here, ain't I? - Are you? - I'm doin' everything I can. [man vocalizing] [folk-pop plays] [man singing] Hey. Is Mr. Trombley in? Yes, sir. He's... Can I help you? Mr. Trombley. We're from Durham Fire and Life Safety Department. Uh... We've got a random inspection order here. On a Sunday? We do 'em when they come in. We'll need access to your breaker panels and your hazardous materials storage area. Yeah, all right. Sure. Uh, come on back. Right this way. So, Mr. Trombley, it, uh, seems your circuit breaker panels are not up to code. You need at least 30-inch clearance on both sides, and you've got a little under two feet. Oh... [stammers] They've been like that for 20 years, since I was a kid. Nevertheless, that needs to be rectified before you can, uh, reopen. Reopen? Yeah. Gotta shut you down... indefinitely. What? Oh, no. I... See, I can't shut down. I got... I got a business here... Th... [chuckles] What are they supposed to do? I'm gonna need them boys outta here... now. Like I said... if you fix things... you'll be open again in no time. You have a nice day, Mr. Trombley. My, my, my. Aren't you a pretty little thing? Who are you? What do you want? Take it easy, Maddy. We're just, uh, [chuckles] friends. Please don't. Shh. It's okay. None of these pictures have niggers in 'em. We heard you might be a friend of niggers. But I don't see none on this wall. Just to be sure though, we're gonna need to hear you say it. Say it? Yes. Say it. That you ain't a friend of niggers. I'm... not a friend of niggers. Again. I'm not a friend of niggers. [scoffs] Well, then. We must've got some bad information. Guess there was no need for the visit after all. Thanks for the beer, Maddy. [jukebox: woman singing country] Hey. Beer, C.P.? Yeah. Thanks, Doreen. [bottle opens] [Wiley laughing] C.P.! Hey, C.P.! What do you say, boys? Come on, sit down. Nah. Been a long week. Just gonna have one beer and go. Oh, come on, C.P. We celebratin'. Yeah. What are you celebratin', Wiley? We celebrating you gettin' your votes, C.P. Well, a little early for that, don't you think? [laughs] But have fun. What do you know about votes, Wiley? [laughing] [people chattering] [door opens] You shut him down? What are you doin' here, C.P.? [door closes] You shut him down. What are you talking about? Lee Trombley. Is that what this is about? You didn't have to do that, Carvie. You didn't have to do that. This not a good time to show up, C.P. I got donors in there. You haven't answered my question. We're just trying to give you a leg up is all. Call it insurance, whatever you want. You got a big vote tomorrow. That man served his country, Carvie. Two tours in Vietnam. He's a working man with a family. Well... "Protect the white working man." Isn't that what you always said, what we always talked about? C.P., sometimes there are necessary evils. Necessary evils for the greater good. And it's my job to make those kind of decisions. You're just gonna have to trust me on this. You should get back to your party. C.P.? Are we good? Hey, Floyd called. Said they want you at Klavern. Klavern? Something about a meeting at 8:30 or something. What? You didn't know? Oh. You all right? You look tired. Yeah, I'm all right. You all right? [chuckles] Yeah, I'm all right. [crowd chattering] [chattering stops] [whispers, indistinct] He's here. Come on up, C.P. Hey. What's goin' on? Distinguished Klansmen, every now and again, extraordinary things occur within our walls that need to be addressed. As your state leader, it is my job to address them. In our fight against communism, against integration, against mongrelism... we turn to those among us who can lead us into a pure, white future. We have one such man here in North Carolina. Your Exhalted Cyclops, C.P. Ellis. [applause, cheering] So, in recognition of this man's tireless effort, for his forethought and vision in establishing the UKA's first Youth Corps... I guess I'll just read this. It says, "The United Klans of America hereby bestow upon Mr. Claiborne Paul Ellis the honor of being named North Carolina's 'Exhalted' Cyclops of the Year, 1971." [indistinct] What do you mean, you're not the right person? Baby, the vote is tonight. Yeah, but there's gotta be somebody else. There's nobody else, Maddy. You heard everything, you've seen everything. No one else can take your seat. What brought this on, Maddy? What happened? - Nothing. I just... - [footsteps approach] It's nothing. Um... It's fine. If you'll just excuse me. [Ann] Mm-hmm. Maddy Mays don't want to vote. Just like that, out of the blue. [snaps fingers] What'd you do to that girl? Now, Ann. I saw the way she looked... Don't you "Now, Ann" me. You coward. I ain't no coward. Yeah, you a coward. Couldn't do it in here. Too many people with they own thoughts. You couldn't win in here, so you went and you fixed it out there. I don't have to listen to this. You gonna listen today. What you so afraid of, C.P.? I ain't afraid of nothing. Yeah, you is. You're afraid. You afraid you gonna lose control. You afraid you gonna lose what you ain't even got, C.P.! You're poor. Just like the rest of us. You ain't got nothing 'cept problems. Talkin' 'bout you... you in control. You ain't no more in control than the man in the moon. You're a bigger coward than I thought you was. [footsteps depart] [male reporter] The five o'clock news hour. With the highly anticipated charrette vote just a few hours away now, we caught up with WDNC's Ken Meadows, who was with some students gathered outside the charrette site earlier today. [Meadows] Do you think it's gonna be okay? [child] Well, it might be all right. [child 2] I think the same thing too. [child 3] Uh-uh. I don't. [Meadows] Why not? I don't. Because, see, our first day that I went out there where we had to scramble, you know. But it was okay. [girl] It doesn't matter what school you go to, it's gonna be the same. You get your education just the same. I'm fixin' to enroll now, and it'll be my school. [Meadows] Are you concerned for your daughter, or is she concerned? [woman] Well, I'm concerned for her, and I think she's concerned for her education. [Meadows] Laverne, I just talked to your mother. She said you're a little concerned. Are you? [Laverne] I'm very much concerned. Why? Oh, because I wanna... I wanna be very sure about this year, and I want to really know what they're doing, and... I think that it will work out if everybody cooperates together. Because, I mean, this is not the, probably, first time... [continues, indistinct] [breath quavers] [loud chattering] - You did great work, Ann. - No. The one thing those people came here for, we didn't get it for 'em. Not true. Some of them will be delighted. [chuckles] You know, I never really thought you was an Uncle Tom. Yes, you did. [both chuckling] "Roughhouse Annie," huh? Don't you forget it. Welcome, welcome. [applause] Well, what a journey it's been, folks. You've all shown such dedication these past two weeks. And regardless of the outcome, you should be proud. The resolution you've put before this senate is clear, it is thoughtful, and above all, it is brave. This resolution is in three parts. After I read out each one, I will call the senate members up to cast their votes. Each part requires a two-thirds majority to pass. That's eight votes. Part one. Two students, one black, one white, to be appointed every year to the Durham school board. I vote yes. Mr. Watford. I'm a no. I vote yes. [applause] [Bill] Part one passes with eight votes. Part two. This calls that summer classes be included in the school board budget so the black students become level with their white peers. Mr. Weeks. I vote no. [scattered applause] Mr. Cox. [Cox] I vote yes. I vote yes. [Bill] Part two passes with eight votes. [applause] Part three. Public school integration. In summary, this calls for full and immediate integration starting in the fall semester of this school year. The resolution defines full integration by setting a race ratio of no less than 25 percent of any race at each school. And further, that busing be made available to students to aid in the implementation of this ratio. We'll start the vote on this side with Miss Wilson. [people whispering] I vote yes. Mr. Watford? I vote no. [applause] Mr. Mose. I vote yes. [applause] Mr. Weeks. I vote "hell no." [cheering, applause] Mr. Cox? I vote "hell yes." [cheering, applause] Mr. Trombley. Thank you, Mr. Riddick. I believe in school integration, and I vote yes. [applause] It's not gonna matter. [Bill] Reverend. With the good Lord as my guide, I proudly vote yes. Miss Mays. Although I think it should be considered in the future, I... I don't believe right now is the time for integration. Respectfully, I vote no. [applause] Hey. [applause quiets] Mr. Clement. I am honored to have had the chance to get to know most of you these past few weeks, to work on these vital issues. And while I fear that my vote will be in vain, I'm still gonna vote. And I vote yes on school integration. Mr. Keith. No. Miss Atwater. Yes. [applause] Looks like we finally shut her up. Mr. Ellis. [applause] All right. All right. All right. Thank you. Thank you. [whistling] I-I-I... - Uh... - [applause quiets] I guess I'd first echo what Mr. Clement said. It was good to get to know some of you, and I... I know many of you will be disappointed with our outcome here. I, uh... You know, before I go on... [clears throat] ...I'd like to show you all something. This is my Klan membership card. [man] All right. [scattered laughter] I was given this card 12 years ago. It's been in my wallet ever since. In fact, I cried when they gave me this card. And I grew up in a house where I was taught men don't cry. But I cried anyway. I cried because it was the first time in my life I didn't feel alone. Sure, I was married with a family. That's not the kind of alone I'm talking about. As a man, you're expected to take care of that family. And I was havin' a hard time doin' that. We were struggling. So... There I was. I was a part of something now. Something much, much bigger than me. And then when they made me president, boy, I was over the moon. Poor old C.P. Ellis president of something. Whoa. [chuckles] And it's a real brotherhood. It is. In the Klan, you look out for one another. Nobody is left behind. Everybody does for everybody else. In fact, it says it right here on this card... It says "Non silba, sed anthar." Which means "Not for oneself, but for others." That's our motto. But see, now I got a problem. There's a problem... 'cause there's a lot of that going around right here in this room. People doin' for others. Last two weeks have been full of people just do... doing for others. And they're not just white people. There's a... There's a lot of black folk doing for others too. But I'm the president of the Klan. I'm supposed to hate black folk. I teach people to hate black folk. They're supposed to be inferior to us. Now, if I don't believe that, then I have no business being president of the Klan. Well, I don't believe it. So my problem is... I don't have no need for this anymore. Mr. Riddick, I vote yes. Jesus! [cheering] [no audible dialogue] I just don't believe it. [Ann] C.P.? C.P.? [phone rings] [rings] Yeah? [Jeb] Where's the key? Jeb! Where's the key? Call the fire department! Come on. [both straining] [woman] Thank you. Next on the agenda is delivery of the charrette resolution. The council recognizes Miss Atwater. [phone rings] [rings] Yeah. Hello? [line disconnects, dial tone] Okay, Mr. Ellis. How many? Well, you lost about 650 gallons. You're lucky the thing didn't explode. Yeah, okay. You want to replace the loss? I can have a truck here tomorrow. No. Let's see how the rest of the month goes. All right. What's this? Would you sign both pages? Thank you, Mr. Ellis. Change your mind, give us a call. Mr. Ellis. Mm-hmm? If you need to let me go, it's okay. You know, until things pick up again. I appreciate that, Jeb. But we're not there yet, okay? So for now, go ahead, take your lunch break. Okay, Mr. Ellis. All right. [vehicle approaches] [bell dings] I hope you didn't come here to ask me to co-chair somethin' else. Nah. I just came to say good-bye is all. Back to Raleigh, huh? Back to Raleigh. What trouble you been causin'? Just organizing, you know me. [chuckles] It's what you do, right? It's just what I do. I sure wish you coulda been there when we handed in our resolution. Mmm. Old Carvie Oldham didn't even show up. [scoffs] Wish I'd seen that. How are you doin', C.P.? Oh, had a little trouble here. Just trying to put it back together. Yeah, we heard. I'm so sorry, C.P. It's okay. Although not sure it matters much. Nobody stoppin' to buy gas from me these days. [horns honking in distance] Well... Maybe things will pick up for you. What you smilin' at? [chuckling] [honking continues] [honking continues] That's just what I do, C.P. You know that. That's just what I do. [bell dings] Hey, Jeb. We got customers. Gas? [chuckles] Gas? [Jeb] All right, sir. [C.P.] You want gas? [Jeb] Yeah, no problem. [C.P.] All right. [soul song plays] [man singing] She can upset the world with her mouth if she wants to. But everywhere I go, every time I pick up a newspaper, Ann Atwater's been before the council, the county commission, or she was at some shopping center boycotting, or she was downtown at Woolworths. And he was woofin' and goin' on, and the place was packed with Klansmen. This particular night, C.P. was up raging and ranting. That's when I wanted to cut his head off. And after that first meeting, I actually went home saying, this is crazy. This is absolutely crazy. I don't think I wanna do this. I mean, I can make a living easier than this. [song continues] The story was picked up in The Washington Post. "Black man calls Klansman 'brother.'" And of course, my father, when he read the story in The Washington Post... he thought I had lost my mind. In becoming my friend, C.P. has lost a lot. Look, you do not make those changes without having to pay for 'em. I know damn well, you know. You have to pay for it eventually. We bonded, and we are still bonding. Until I get mad with him at times. But we've made it through these years, together 30 years, and we're still friends. [song continues] 'Cause there are C.P. Ellises and Ann Atwaters in almost every community. They just need to be brought together and experience what we experienced in Durham with that charrette.
