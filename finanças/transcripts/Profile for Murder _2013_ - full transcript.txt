[Gulls squawking] [♪♪] [Doors squeak open] [♪♪] Amber, come on. You're going to be late for school. Is my outfit okay? Jordan says pink on pink doesn't work. Do you like it? Yeah. Whatever works for you is all that matters. Go get in the car. I'm driving you today. Dad's already left for work. [♪♪] Aw, man! Another tardy slip. Hey! Bonnie's gonna pick you up after school today. I have something I have to do. Okay. Hey, hey! I love you. Love you. [♪♪] [Radio reporter]: The mastermind of the escape is reported to be the infamous serial killer Jeffrey calgrove. Convicted for the murder of one woman, and suspected in four other homicides, calgrove tortured and strangled his victims, leaving the marine whip line tied in a bow around their neck. Five women, each in the wrong place at the wrong time, their bodies each found in city dumpsters, except for Savannah white, the high-priced call girl-turned-madame with purported powerful connections. Calgrove maintained his innocence in the killing of white, although he never publicly commented on his alleged involvement in the other four murders. Congratulations, you two, on another successful conviction. Life without parole. That psycho's off the streets for good. Well, we nailed him for Savannah white, but I would've loved to prove calgrove was the "whip line strangler." Those other four women deserve their day in court, too. Stop beating yourself up over it. We got him and he's never getting out. If only I'd caught him at the scene. Then he couldn't play the "innocent" card and we would have gotten a confession. Is there any evidence to tie him to the four previous murders with the same m.O.? No. This one was sloppier than the others. He never got a chance to finish the job. He heard Jackie coming and beat a retreat. Just be glad for that anonymous tip that led you to the coins with calgrove's fingerprints on them. That's right. Without that, he'd still be out there. She done good. You done good. [Buttons beeping] [Cell rings] Sam baxford. Sam? It's Jackie. Calling to say hello? Don't play with me, Sam. It's all over the news. We're on top of it. I need more. I need details. Last I remember, you're no longer privy to internal investigations. You gave up that right when you turned in your badge. Come on, Sam! Calgrove was our case. He went to jail two years ago, and nobody's heard from you since. How is life as a stay-at-home mom? Please, don't do this, Sam. Sorry. You know the rules. [Beeps phone off] [♪♪] [Knocking at door] [Door creaks] I was a jerk. Yes, you were. We were a team. Call me sensitive, but a Christmas card might have been nice. Sam... It was hard enough leaving. Cutting it off made it easier. You're in the program. Try and understand that. I like the wheels. Thank you. Life's good. You still doing herbal tea? No. I've switched to the hard stuff. Make it leaded. Nice watch. They're going to have to Bury me in it. This was one hell of a birthday gift. Between the 10 of US, it was still too expensive. Platinum's not cheap. So? Why the sudden social visit? We got a tip from an rv park 50 miles outside the prison. A resident there said he spotted three men that fit the convicts' descriptions. By the time the other cops get there, the other two will be dead. Calgrove doesn't need them anymore. He has a purpose. He's on a mission, and I'm it. Nobody knows him like we do, Sam. And he won't stop at me. He'll go after my family. Don't worry. You know I'm not gonna let anything happen to you, Jackie. Not to you, or to Amber. Uh... ahem. [Sets cup down] Really bad. [Phone rings] Hello? Well, you were right. Found calgrove's buddies. Both shot through the head. Just hang by the phone. He can't get far. You don't believe that. Don't placate me. Jackie? Jackie. Come to bed. [Phone rings] Sam? Sam? [Line clicks, dial tone buzzes] It was him. You don't know that. It was calgrove. It was probably some punk kid. They make crank calls all the time. [Sighs] Jackie... We can't live like this again. He said he would make me pay for putting him behind bars. Y-You heard him swear it in the courtroom. Coming back here doesn't make sense. Sick people don't make sense. He's going to kill again. It's like a drug for him. The closer he gets to me, the more excitable and dangerous he'll get. Look what you're doing to yourself why can't you just trust me? I know how killers think. I was trained at it. It was my job. I hated your job. I'm sorry, Jackie, but I never understood it. How could anyone do what you did, and not be impacted by it? And you were. You projected your fears and your horrors onto our family... [Clicks mouse] Now you're doing it all over again. [♪♪] [Phone rings] Sam, tell me it's over. [Man's voice]: It's not over, bitch. Remember me? I've thought about you every damn minute I was locked behind bars. You're going to pay for setting me up. Afraid to talk, you lying bitch? [Sing-song]: I can hear you breathing... [Scoffs] Enjoy it. You won't be for long. Left a present for you where the 5 and 99 meet. A little preview of things to come. Next, it'll be your husband, then it'll be your daughter. I'm going to make you watch. And when I'm done, I'm gonna tie a pretty little bow around your neck. I heard you like gift-wrap. [Calgrove snickering] [Text beeps] [Beeps phone off] [♪♪] [Radios crackling indistinctly] That's what my tutor said. Here. Got it. They found the body. Amber, why don't you go upstairs, honey? Okay. White female, approximately 45 years of age. Cause of death, strangulation. By "a pretty little bow" tied around her neck. Call came from the dead woman's cell, near Grant's pass, Oregon. He could be here at any time. Well, that's 350, 400 miles away. He'll move quick. He'll find a way. Jackie's right. The only thing greater than his need to kill is his I.Q. Richard, we're gonna need you to lay low for a little while, get off the grid. I'm responsible for an entire department. I've got students that depend on me. Your family's safety should come first. Take Amber and go to a hotel. What about Jackie? I need to be here. What if he tries to contact me again? It's too dangerous. [Sam]: We'll take care of her. I'll make sure she's safe. I don't want my wife being used as bait. [Heavy sigh] I have to do this. It's the only way I can be sure that you two are safe. Let's be real, Jackie. You haven't felt safe in a long time. Even if they catch him, you think that's going to change? It's all right, baby. It's only for a couple of days. [♪♪] [Tires squealing] [Crash erupts] [♪♪] [Phone ringing] Okay, Sam. Hey. My bad, right? Really? Yeah. Hey. What do we got? It's over, Jackie. - Really? - Yeah. Take a look. What's the matter, Sam? Afraid she'll be out of your life again? [Cell rings] Bailey. Thank you. We've got a print match. That's fantastic. The impact from the propane explosion sent calgrove's body into the bay. Coast guard's searching for him now. [Jackie]: I can barely make him out. Well, hopefully, we got a better shot. That's where we pulled the prints from, the lockbox. Well, one thing's for certain. He has good taste in motorcycles. And he's outta there. - That's it? - Mm. We don't have enough to I.D. Him. Prints? We know that he can pull anything off! Sorry. We don't have anything! Wait. Yes we do. There he is. It's him. [♪♪] Oh. [Chuckling] We got him. [♪♪] Come here, honey! Well, it took an act of god, but we got him. I guess sometimes the big guy throws in a perk. She's a good woman, Richard. [Birds chirping] [Dialing] [Phone rings] Hello? Hey. I need to see you. How about half an hour? Okay. Seeya. Where are you going? Dinner's almost ready. Sorry. There's something I need to do. Don't wait for me. [Footsteps receding] [♪♪] [♪♪] You are so beautiful. Next, it'll be your husband. Then it'll be your daughter. When I'm done, I'm gonna tie a pretty little bow around your neck. [♪♪] [Phone rings] [Snaps]: Richard, please. I know it's you, calgrove. You stay away from my family. You hear me? I will not let you come near them. You hear me, you son of a bitch? Amber... I am so sorry. Come here, honey. [♪♪] Look what you're doing. You need help. You need to get back into therapy. [Elevator bell dings] [♪♪] [Knocking] Come in, Jackie. [♪♪] I keep... Thinking about what could happen to Amber. I keep seeing these images playing over and over in my head. [Takes a shaky breath, sighs] I can't get rid of them. Look what you've been through, Jackie. It's natural to be afraid. Your fears haven't left you, and now, the prison break, more murders, they've caused them to escalate. How do I get rid of the fear? Soldiers with post-traumatic stress don't just get rid of it. They heal by learning to cope. It will get better, but you have to give it time. There's someone I want you to see. I... I want to stay with you. Dr. Porterson is a specialist in cognitive therapy. He's going to be perfect for you. [♪♪] [Over phone]: Mrs. Wincroft? This is Diana, the vice-principal at Amber's school. Just calling to verify your husband is on his way to pick up Amber for her dental appointment? [Brakes screech] [Door bangs open] Is she here? Is she in her classroom? Yes! She's in her classroom. [Wheezing] Richard did not call. Amber doesn't have a dental appointment. I thought it was odd. He spoke with my secretary. When I called back to verify, nobody answered. Is there a problem? My daughter is in danger. Please, you have to be on the look-out for this man. If you see him, call me. Hasn't he been on the news? It's Jeffrey calgrove. They say he died at the golden gate, but his death hasn't been confirmed. Well, rest assured, we keep our eyes on her at all times. Thank you. I'll talk to the principal. We'll make copies and distribute a copy of this photo to everyone. [Exhales wearily] Hey. Thanks for the invite. What's the occasion? We need to reopen the case, Sam. Come on, Jackie. You know I can't do that. It's over. We have conclusive evidence that it was calgrove on the bike. There's been more phone calls. Did he identify himself? Did you two have a conversation? He called Amber's school, posing as Richard. He tried to pick her up. Whoever the pervert is, we'll take care of him, but it wasn't calgrove. What if he survived that fall? Come on, Jackie. At least 15 people have done it in the last five years alone, Sam. And how many hundreds have jumped? It's a stretch, even for you. The coast guard searched the bay. The tide has swept away what's left of him. He's shark bait by now. He was smiling in the camera because he was taunting me. He's in his domination phase. When are you going to end this crap? He's dead! What are you gonna do, keep looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life? He's coming to kill my family, Sam! Just give me access to his files. To do what? Try and find Margaret. She'll know where he is. That old junkie's topsoil by now. Please, Sam. Just get me the files. You know I have a hard time saying no to you. This is harassment. I'll do the rest on my own. You're a pain in the ass. You're going to buy me lunch. I'm ordering lobster. You can afford it. You got a big sailboat out here. We're downsizing. Smaller boat, different name. Calling her Serenity. Serenity? It's Richard's dream that we'll all sail away on it. Sailboat's too much work. I see a yacht in my future. I've made the right investments. I'm going to sit back, let the crew do the work. Want to come with? We have problem. Hmm? I have a family! They can come, too. You thought I just meant you? Hah! Jackie. Jackie, that's kind of naughty. [Sam laughing] [Phone rings] Hello? I thought I'd cook lamb chops tonight. Well, that sounds good. Amber's gonna be dropped off after dinner. Could you run by the store and pick up the chops? I'm going to be late. Where are you? I have an afternoon therapy session. All right, yeah. Sure. Thank you, honey. Bye-bye. [Dialing] [Phone rings] Hello? Hi. I thought we were meeting at 5:00? We are. Oh. Okay. Good. I'll see you then. [Thumps phone down] [Blows anxiously] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [Door creaks] [Muffled casual voices, televisions playing] [Knocking] [Door opens] - I'm looking for a woman... - [Door slams] [♪♪] [Door slams] [♪♪] [Bottles clattering, distant dog barking] Hey! Aww! You broke my needle, lady. This is my delivery system. Do you live around here? I'm looking for a woman named Margaret calgrove. She lived in six with her son, Jeff. Look, if you have any information, any information at all, I can make it worth your while. Call me if you see her. [Cans clattering] [Richard]: How was your day? Guess what? We've already made half the money for our field trip. Tell your dad where you're going. Sacramento and the train museum, old town, and the state capitol. Hey! Sweetie, that's great. [Floorboard creaking] [Phone rings] We agreed. No phone calls during dinner. [Ringing continues] What the...? Mom? Don't worry. We just blew a fuse. What are you doing? I'm getting a flashlight. No. Stay with Amber. I'll take a look. [Quiet thump] What was that? Come here. [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] You stay here, sweetheart. I'll go find her. [♪♪] Jackie? [Branch snaps] [♪♪] [Thud] [♪♪] [Power clicking on] [Groans] Jackie! You okay? I'm fine. Oh! I'm fine. Someone was running from the house. Jackie... We had an agreement. No guns with Amber in the house. It was calgrove. You don't know that. After what happened today? It doesn't matter. It does matter! He tried to pick Amber up from school. Let's get you in the house. You're not even listening to me! We have to hide this thing! Please, Jackie. Try to act normal when Amber sees you. [♪♪] [Car horn honks] [Shutter snaps] [♪♪] That's a good set-up. These guys know what they're doing. You're starting to believe me now? The neighborhood's been reporting similar incidents. Most likely, you've got a run-of-the-mill perv on your hands. All the same, I'm glad you've got it covered. I'll take that as a yes. Taking any special precautions with Amber? Bonnie's picking her up after school today. She can stay over there until I'm sure it's safe. Good. These guys'll be watching 24/7. They see anything suspicious, they'll alert US right away. What about Margaret? Any luck finding her? Sam... I can't put Savannah white's murder to rest. Oh, come on, Jackie. We've been over this a hundred times. Calgrove always drank at the same bar. Those coins with his prints they could've been picked up and planted at the scene. And he always stopped just short of taking credit for the other murders, but not white's. Why do you think that is? Maybe the work didn't meet his high standards. Something's not right. It was the same m.O. The same rope, the same marks on her neck, the same entry, it all matches. But not the signature. The signature never changes. The emotional core, what's unique to the personality. That's what you taught me. Bravo. Calgrove's thrill isn't in the kill. It's in the overpowering. He didn't batter or torture white. He heard you. You interrupted him. That's the only logical explanation. Whoever tipped me off had a motive. Or they wouldn't have come forward. They didn't want to be on radar... His, or ours. [Text alert chimes] What is it? Oh, my god! Bonnie? Bonnie! Where the hell are you? She's not picking up! [Tires squealing] [Siren starts wailing] [Siren wailing] We need back-up at 114 tellwin street. Please be advised, there's a child in the house. Bonnie, where the hell are you? Bonnie! She's not even answering. [Tires squealing, sirens wailing] Stay here. Jackie. Stay there. [Bangs on door] Police! Open the door! [♪♪] [Door thumps wall] Amber? Amber! Bonnie! Amber? [Phone beeps] I'm really sorry for the inconvenience. Thanks again. It's okay, mom. We just walked to the mall. [Door bangs] What happened? Is everything okay? We had a little emergency. It was cool, dad. All these police showed up, just like on a TV show. Go inside, Amber. I'll be in in a minute. [Door closes] He sent another text, and he said he had Amber. Sam rushed me to Bonnie's. Turned out to be a false alarm. I want another officer on the case. He doesn't support you, Jackie. He never has. That's not true. Richard's been under a lot of pressure at work. He just hasn't been himself lately. Don't make excuses for him. You deserve better. Don't go there, Sam. Marriages have struggles. He's a good man. He's a great father. He's loyal. You should wake up, Jackie. When are you going to see what's going on? What are you saying? Loyalty shouldn't be one-way. You're not good at reading people closest to you. Hold on! Now, you brought it up. I'm not gonna let you just drive away. What are you saying? Is he having an affair? Why don't you ask your therapist? He's seeing Dr. Dillson? Are you telling me they're lovers? For how long? You came this far. You tell me what you know. I don't know anything for sure. I'm sorry. What else do you know? Does he take her on business trips? What hotels do they stay at? Do you know much money we have in the bank? How about how much I've charged on my credit cards this month? And how the hell do you know I have a therapist? How dare you invade my life? Why don't you just leave me alone? You know why. [♪♪] [♪♪] This is going to be so cool! Aunt Elaine said the San Diego zoo has a polar ice cap you can ski on. That's great, sweetie. Thank you so much for doing this, Elaine. I'm happy to do it. It's so last-minute. It'll be fun. [Engine starts] [Vehicle departs] [Door shuts] Why didn't you tell me Elaine called? It happened so fast, Richard. The time-share at the beach came up, and she offered to fly her there. How can you make plans like this and not tell me? Because I knew you'd say no. Oh, come on! Our daughter is in danger. Jackie, you manipulated this! When are you going to come to grips with what's going on? Calgrove took photos of Amber, he tracked her to Bonnie's house. [Sighs] Somebody had to take action. Just look at these! [Sighs] There's nothing here. No photos, no messages. He must have some way of deleting them. That's not possible! Of course it is! There are programs that do that. Check it out. Don't tell me what he can do. I know him! He can't tie me to a chair, so this is his way of torturing me. The photos were there. Ask Sam. You're just trying to bring Sam back into your life. That's insane. You think I don't know how you thought about him, day and night? How you always brought your work home? Richard. I think you're in love with him. I have never been unfaithful to you. Can you say the same? [Sighs] How can you even ask me that? [♪♪] [Starts car] [♪♪] [Calgrove]: When I'm done, I'm gonna tie a pretty little bow around your neck. [Tires squealing] [Metal crunching] [♪♪] Well, she has been under a tremendous amount of pressure. Maybe there's some kind of medication you can give her to help her through this? Yeah, we can take care of that. Just give me a sec and I'll be right in. - Okay? - Great. Jackie. You're okay. It's just a precaution. [Groans] Doctor says you're gonna be fine. [Footsteps] Mrs. Wincroft, your x-rays look good. No broken bones. You're a lucky lady, but you are gonna be sore for awhile. - When can I leave? - You have a concussion. We're gonna keep you overnight, just for observation. Is there anything that you need? No, thank you. All right. I will see you in the morning. [P.A.]: Dr. Miller, phone call at nurses' station four. Dr. Miller, phone call at nurses' station four. I called Theresa dillson. I asked her to come and talk to you. Richard... Why? What if Amber had been in the car? We need you. I don't know what we'd do without you. However long it takes, we need you to get better. [♪♪] [Phone beeping] Baxford. What? What happened? You okay? I was driving. I was upset, I looked over, and there it was... Tied in a bow. I'll be there in 10. No. Richard may come back and I don't want him to see you. What do you need? My car was towed. I don't know where it is. I'll find it. The line should still be in there. Don't worry. I'll get it. Sam... The doctor wants to keep me overnight, but I think they'll try to keep me here. I need a car. I gotta get out of this place. [♪♪] Mornin'. [Gate rattling] What kind of cop are you, anyway? Homicide. I specialize in behavioral analysis. Did somebody die in this wreck? I thought some lady just hit a tree or something. That's right, but this vehicle's involved in another open investigation. Sicko stuff. Looking at dead bodies all day will make you a little crazy yourself, huh? You get used to it. Can't complain. It's a job. A lot of people out of work. Yeah. Lazy is all they are. Livin' off the system. You know you can't take nothing out of this car without a search warrant. Right? Is that so? Well, you're a cop. Fourth amendment. Right of the people. You don't like it, complain to the founding fathers. All done here. [Door bangs shut] Have a great day. [♪♪] [♪♪] Jackie wincroft's room? [Announcement crackles]: Dr. Mclean to pediatrics. Dr. Mclean to pediatrics. [Knocks] They're beautiful. How do you feel? [Sighs wearily] Like I've been on the losing end of a boxing match. Jackie, I talked to Dr. Porterson, the cognitive therapist. Says you didn't call him. I think you need to spend a few more days here. You look tired. I'm fine. Don't you think you need some time to get away from your routine, the house, your family? How's your relationship with Richard? Becoming more and more distant. I think he's having an affair. Everything is confusing now. All the more reason for you to take a break. The garden pavilion, it's peaceful, quiet. Yeah, I've read the reviews. Great food, group therapy, locked doors. Not where you'll be staying. The garden is a place for you to decompress and really take a look at things. Only for a couple of days. I'll make the arrangements. I have to sleep. Of course. You take all the time you need. [♪♪] [♪♪] How's my car? [Sam]: Not good. It's at a wreckage yard. The guy looking after it thinks he's Thomas Jefferson. [♪♪] [Horn honks] They sell the same damned line at every marine store up and down the coast, but we'll run tests and see what we get. I got you a hotel room. The address and registration are in the glove box. Jackie, I shouldn't have told you about Richard. I think a part of me always knew. I think it hurt that it came from you. Stay safe. [♪♪] [Starts engine] [♪♪] Hi there. You recognize this man? Yeah, the fugitive. He was all over the news. Was he here? Did he buy anything? No way. I'd remember that face. Hey. He took a header, right? Flew over the rail on a hot bike? [Background chatter] [Cell rings] Hello? Yeah. You're... You're the one lookin' for... [Coughs] For Jeffrey's ma? You found Margaret? Yeah. Bring the money. I'll be waiting. [Siren wails distantly] Hey! Give me the money. Give me the money! Not until I get an address. - Gimme... - A legitimate one. [Hyperventilating] A bitch cop, huh? You got it or not? If you lied, I'll find you. [Giggles greedily] [♪♪] [Horn honks, locks engage] [♪♪] [♪♪] [Knocks] [Muffled]: Who is it? Margaret? Is that you? Do you remember me? Don't know if I do. Margaret, I was wondering if you could... Tell me about Jeffrey. You could find out all you want on the news. My Jeffrey's dead. Else he'd be here, right here with his mama. I'm sorry. Hadn't gone to the pen, he'd still be here. He never killed that Savannah woman. That night, my boy was home with me. He was home with his mama. I should've... I should've talked to them people, I should've told them that "I have to put my hand on that Bible." You weren't a credible witness, Margaret. You were strung out on heroin that night. How could you have known he was there? I'd know. My boy was the only one I let shoot me up. Anyway, he'd never kill a prostitute, that's for sure. Why do you say that? My boy was born to one. He knew what I did to keep him fed and he never went hungry, not a day in his life. He loved his mama. [♪♪] I know you. You're the one who said he did it. Liar! I'm sorry. You're gonna go to hell for what you said! I'm sorry. You get out! You get out! You get out of my house! You get out! Get out! [Slam] [Sobbing] You killed my boy! It's your fault! He's dead! He's dead 'cause of you! It's 'cause of you. He never killed that woman. My boy never... [Breaks into weeping] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] There's a piece we missed. Who gives a damn? He's watching you. You need to get off the streets. [Banging on window] [Beeps phone off] Damn it, Jackie. - [Blares horn] - Go! [♪♪] [TV reporter]: It was here, just 30 minutes ago, an officer came upon the grisly murder scene... [TV reporter #2]: Yesterday, finally, finally, physical evidence was found at the condominium... Coins of evidence. Now, calgrove was interrogated twice on four other murders and got off for lack of evidence. Not this time. [Droning of heavy machines on video] [Click] It was here, just 30 minutes ago... [Jackhammer pounding] An officer came upon the grisly murder scene... [Jack-hammering] Physical evidence was found in the condominium. Coins of evidence, people. Now, calgrove was interrogated twice on four other murders and got off for lack of evidence. Not this time. [Bailey]: Is there any evidence to tie him to the four previous murders with the same m.O.? [Jackie]: No. This one was sloppier than the others. [Sam]: He never got a chance to finish the job. He heard Jackie coming and beat a retreat. [Bailey]: Just be glad for that anonymous tip that led you to the coins with calgrove's fingerprints on them. [♪♪] It was here, just 30 minutes ago... [Jackhammer pounding] [Click] Murders and got off for lack of evidence. Not this time. [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [Window whirs] [♪♪] [Dialing] [Phone rings] Hello? Hi, Elaine. Is Amber there? Sure thing. Amber? It's your mom. Hi, mommy. I miss you. Hey, baby. Are you having fun? Yeah! The zoo's awesome. They have a new baby giraffe. Aw. I wish I could be there with you. I miss you. I wish you were here, too. I love you. Love you. Bye, mom. [Beep] [Beeps phone off] - [Pounding on door] - [Sam]: Jackie! Jackie! [Pounding] Oh, thank god. Where the hell have you been? No way he could've heard me coming. The news clip proves it. I had forgotten about the construction the day of the murder. You have a death wish or something? You have a killer on your ass, and you're out there playing a game of "clue." I'm the one who took the stand. I took an oath. We missed a beat? Calgrove is trash. Why do you care so much? It matters. A killer could be walking around free. It won't be the first time, and it sure as hell won't be the last. You never would have said that two years ago. There are more important things for you to be thinking about right now. Like you, Sam? Like your daughter. You're no good to anyone dead. And, yes, me. I'd just gotten over you and then you turn up again. It's making me crazy. You need to get some sleep. Fat chance. When are we gonna stop pretending like there's nothing going on here? You have to admit it's been just as hard on you as it has been on me, not seeing each other every day. Yes. So, what are we gonna do about it? Sam. Come on, Jackie. Richard has not been faithful. I'm sorry. Shouldn't have done that. [Door shuts] [♪♪] [Phone ringing] [Wheels rattling] [Beep] Wow! "Out of the blue" is an understatement. Where you been, Ms. Jackie? You're the buzz about town. You tell me. Word was you've been baking cupcakes. So what do ya need? Everything you've got on Savannah white's murder. Discovery, trial... Anything. Gotcha. You need it for TV, mags, or rags, I'm your man. Is that pick-up or delivery? Can you email it to me? [♪♪] [Phone chimes] [♪♪] [Richard]: Dr. Wincroft here. Please leave a message. [Beep] Richard? Listen. You're in danger. Go someplace safe. If you're around people, get to a police station. Whatever you do, don't be alone. [♪♪] Bailey here. Bailey, I need you to get through to Sam for me. [Brakes screech] [♪♪] Richard! Richard. Richard! [♪♪] Theresa. Theresa. [Richard]: Dr. Wincroft here. Please leave a message. [Beep] The message said 3:00. I don't think I can make it, Sam, I'm just leaving campus. Where's Richard now? Theresa's office, 8974 kedmont ave. [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [Door bangs] Drop it, calgrove, or I'll blow your head off! [Exhales] [Phone rings] [Text chimes] [Panting] [♪♪] Shouting, and I walked through the door, and she's pointing a gun at me, right at my head, and I'm terrified. [Fuming sigh] Do you have any idea the problems you've caused this department? I mean, we're looking at, uh, aggravated assault, colluding with an officer. He could have our asses. Calgrove is sending me messages. Then where is it, Jackie? He's dead. Prove that to me! I don't have to prove a damn thing to you! You are no longer a part of this department. You no longer have access to our records, our staff, including Sam. He's taunting me. He's sending me messages and he's deleting them. I saw one, Mike. Yeah, yeah. You've always been watching her ass. Not only is Mr. Clean going to be a problem, your therapist is out there right now, making a report. What? What's she doing here? She says it's her ethical duty to report any concerns about you. Come on. You believe that? Do you? You've had problems before, Jackie. [Alarm chirps] It's not enough that you're sleeping with my husband, you've got to get me locked up, too? [Sighs] I'm not sleeping with Richard. Jackie, I'm here because I'm genuinely concerned about you. I have ways of knowing. He goes to your house. You guys meet at different places. There's been phone calls. Richard is my patient. There is nothing going on between US. I don't believe you. Well, you're going to have to. I can't tell you any more. I have already broken my confidentiality. Is it our marriage? Jackie, you need to talk to Richard. [Car starts] Why didn't you tell me you were seeing Theresa? [Sighs heavily] I can't do this anymore. I'm going to the boat. Richard, what's going on? I never know how you're going to react to things, Jackie. I can't talk to you. You can tell me anything. I'm your wife. No. I can't. There was a time when I could, but I can't anymore. I started going to her office to ask about you and try and get some insight into what you were going through, help bridge this gap that's been growing between US, but, soon, I wasn't asking her about you, I was telling her about me. I had an easier time talking to her than you. My own wife. You should've come to me. [Sighs] Our life was good till Jeffrey calgrove came into it. I didn't invite him in. He's dead. He's a ghost. But it's not over for you. He's never going to leave our lives. [Zips bag shut] I think you proved that today when you almost killed an innocent man. [♪♪] [Shutter snapping] [Telephone rings] Hello. Hey, babe. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine, Sam. You don't sound fine. I can hear it in your voice. You heard Mike. I'm bad news. You should stay away. Well, that ain't gonna happen. You ever wonder what life would've been like if we'd never met? Yeah, a sad day in hell. Would have been a whole lot easier. A whole lot more simple. I'm in your corner, Jackie. A lot of other people aren't. You telling me to stay away? I don't know. I don't know what I'm saying. I got to go, Richard's here. Yeah. [Beep] [Sighs wearily] [Bell clangs] [Hugo]: Excellent news. Get this. I'm speaking at defcon. Oh. What's defcon? "What's defcon?" Only the world's largest hacking convention. I'm making two presentations, "cracking computer systems" and "dirty secrets of the feds." And they're going to let me sell my DVDs, "how to fuzz." Pure profit. What's fuzzing? It's basically a program designed to discover security vulnerabilities by sending out random input. But, Hugo, isn't all this stuff illegal? Hey, we're providing a service. By teaching people how to hack, they can stay one step ahead of the hackers. Oh! You wanna check out my DVD? I'm sure it's great, but when I've had more sleep. Dude, your eyes are glazed like a donut. I went over all the pages you gave me, and nothing new. Put you on overwhelm, huh? Savannah ran a tight operation. Hells, yes. At the time of the investigation, we even had a hard time finding her Johns. Word was she had professional protection, someone supposedly legit. He did the dirty work, and she moved up the ranks and they became partners. Hugo, I know there are programs that can be timed to make a call, but can they be programmed... - To retrieve a call? - Yes. It can be done. [Birds singing] [Crashing] [♪♪] [Phone chimes] [♪♪] [♪♪] [Calling out]: Richard! Richard! Richard! Richard! Richard! Richard! [Shot fires] [Shot echoing] Richard! [Gasps] [Wheezing] I got a man down! Gunshot wound to the chest. In the Marina, slip 77. [Gurgling and groaning] [♪♪] No, wait! I got to check the airways. [♪♪] [Phone chimes] [Dialing] [Amber's voice]: Mom? We caught an earlier flight and just landed. Aunt Elaine and I will be home in an hour. Can't wait to see you. He'll be at city general. We got a strong heartbeat. We'll do our best. Hi. It's Elaine. Please leave a message. Elaine, I need to talk to you as soon as you can. [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [Keys clatter in dish] [♪♪] [Wine bottle thuds] [Calls out]: You still there? [♪♪] Is this what it all comes down to? Just you and me? Where are you? Damn it! You're here. I can feel you. It's not your style... Tie a pretty little bow and leave. All this time... I've been reading the mind of a killer. Only the killer... Has been you. Wasn't it, Sam? [♪♪] Very clever, killing Savannah and using calgrove's m.O. I thought it was a nice touch. [♪♪] What's wrong? She didn't pay you enough? [Sam]: She wouldn't take my generous offer of a 50-50 split. And then she tried to blackmail me. I had to kill her. Why'd you do it, Sam? How couldn't I? When calgrove turned up again, it was a sign. We belong together. I couldn't lose you again. You tortured me! And the people I love! [Raising voice]: Richard doesn't love you! All you had to do was leave him, Jackie! That is all you had to do! So I took care of it. You're welcome. [♪♪] You're sick, Sam! Come on, Jackie. You'll always be mine. [Slams door] [Loads chamber] No more, Sam! Don't push me. Don't make me kill you! - Jackie. - [Gasping] I like it when you play rough. So tell me. What tipped you off? Down-sizing. Down-sizing? You're the only one who knew that we were changing the name of the boat to "Serenity." My god, you're so good. [Laughing] Doesn't prove anything. Oh, but maybe the text messages will, Sam. I have proof of where they originated, how they were set up, how they were sent. And I have you recorded on my cell phone. Mm. Get your hands off. [♪♪] You don't mind, do you? [♪♪] [Chuckles] We don't need these, do we? No? [Unloads gun] It's okay. [♪♪] You're so sexy. [Jackie grunting] [♪♪] [Both grunting] [Shot fires and Sam groans] [♪♪] [Weakly]: I loved you, Jackie. I loved you. [Jackie sighs] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] Here's my report, sir. This time, I got it right. Looks good. Great to have you back. Are you sure you're ready for this? This is where I belong, captain. I'm at my best when I'm doing this job. Just so you know, the department has counseling services available if you ever feel you need it. I'm not going to let anyone or anything take away someone I love or deny me what I love to do. The calgroves of this world can't do that to me anymore. Sorry, sir. I have to get home to dinner. Give Amber a hug for me. She's back. Hmph! Catch any bad guys today, mommy? No. Not today. I can't catch one every day. Mostly because the bad guys know better than to mess with mom these days. [♪♪] Life is good. [♪♪]
