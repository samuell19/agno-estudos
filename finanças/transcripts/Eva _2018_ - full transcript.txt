Hey. You are very late. - I know. Sorry, M. Culson. - It's Coulson, not Culson. Do not you drink? No. Not when I work. It does not help to be so alone. That is why you would also be more often to come along. Why do not you go back to England? No more power, my angel. I had a lot of success, did you know that? Yes, you said that a hundred times. That must be done, otherwise I will forget it. "Wild Fire." 'Trainée de poudre' in French. I have the Booker Prize won with that novel. You said last that you had started writing again. Yes. And I just finished it. I see. It is a comedy, for the stage. But it will never be performed. Why not? In England they call me a has-leg. But in France they find me too dark. Do you want to read it? It is called 'Passwords'. "Mots the passe." It is very funny. - Read it out. Get my glass for a moment. Is everything alright? Thank you, my angel. Is not it too hot? - It's perfect. Perfect. Come to me. Get my dressing gown. Take everything that is in the bags. Take it. Dress up now. And come to me. On my desk. Digoxin. Fast. Digoxin. You said there is a password at the door. You said I had to write it down, but my pen was empty. That way we can 'wait' for a long time. You play with my head. Ah, your head. That was it for today. I will not leave without that password. Stand up, Madeleine. The word. Give me the floor. 'Mouth?' - No. It is on the tip of my tongue. - 'Mouth shut?' You work on my nerves. - 'Just wait. Stand up, Madeleine. This is the closing evening, Bertrand. Make a bow. Ladies and gentlemen: Bertrand Valade. Is it going well? - Look, what a success. And further? I am still waiting for the sequel. Not tonight, Régis. Do not protect him. You have to choose. Do you want to fire me? - What nonsense. I enjoyed it. It is really good. Can I get a signature? The whole is very British. Have you lived in England? Yes, that is somewhat true. I love the English. For who is it? - Thierry. Have a good trip, Thierry. A glass of water, please. On the sequel. I thought you stopped. You said you have a new piece ready would have. Did I dream that? I started a novel. Are you serious? Time is running out, Bertrand. The meter is running. Speak for yourself. Where are you going? - Home. And then the party? - What party? You can not just leave. What should I? - Come to me. If I do not deliver, I have to pay him back. Relax. And if I'm on black seed? - That does not happen. Why not? - Because you have me. I do not say anything. - At work then. What do you have so far? I have an idea for a comedy. - Can I see it? It is too early. Something is brewing. Is that the title? - Well. I can not write here. And the chalet of my parents? There am you alone. Then I will end of the week. Why not? I leave Mme Germain shopping. Then all I have to do is write. - Nobody can do it for you. Do you know what Laure said yesterday? Is it still predicting the future? That we are made for each other. Horrible. - Yes. But it is no different. So... - The chalet? Sorry. Richard Barrot. I pay for the window and the hatch. And for the whiskey? - We were cold. We were stuck. Who are we'? - Eve. A whiskey? Where are you, Richard? I'm thirsty. You had to be ashamed. This is my house. - And then? Get out. And close the door. How do you find her? We can share her. Go away. Excuse me? - Shake up. I'll take her. Are you crazy? Come down, Eva. What are you doing? Do you mind exchanging a customer? - Where is Richard? Outside. In the freezer. Toe... A good example. I fell down the stairs. - Free fall? That would be a nice title. How far do you stand with your book? It has become a play. Boy meets girl at a party. He wants to catch her. But she hits him with an ashtray on his head. He comes to the hospital, sees his fiancee... and does whether he does not recognize her. Do you understand? It's about a man that pretends memory loss. And so he can afford everything. I have yet to see it. - You will see it. Caroline and Alban are waiting for you. Hello, Bertrand. Got out? Indeed. We start in Annecy. Dan Lyon, Grenoble, Marseille, Toulouse. Why Annecy? - Just ask Caroline. We start in two weeks. But we have to delete something. I'll leave you alone for a moment. You keep lying. I'm fed up with it. I do not lie. I was drunk and I fell from the stairs. I fainted. - Is that right? I do not know anything about it anymore. You slept out of bed, you broke into it, but nothing has been stolen. Nothing at all. Mme told that Germain. Was that all? No. I'm not retarded, though. You're going to swipe. Yes, with me. Denis? Excuse me. I confused it with Jean-Denis. Of course, Denis. How are you? So late? That costs a lot. The Beaulieu is a well-run theater. 70,000 spectators per year. Are you sleeping? Caroline says what it says. We talk a lot with each other. - Good. She really loves you. I do not feel like it with you about Caroline. Good. Have you seen what I deleted? Yes. It is fine by me. - It seems like you do not care. 'Mots de passe' is passé. That's where the writer sounded in you. - Thank you. Why did you actually come along? Hey. We worked for the same client, Mme de Tassin. How is she doing? - She is dead. Are you still doing it? - No, I stopped. Then you are lucky. Okay, see you then. I go straight to bed. At what time tomorrow? - You do not have to come. What time? - At eight o 'clock. Appointment with the director. Okay, I'll see. You have to keep an eye on me from Caroline? Do not be weird. Welcome, M. Valade. We wish you a pleasant stay in our hotel. 'What are you doing?' He: 'Do you want to change customers?' She: "And Richard? Where is he?' No. 'Where is he? Where is Richard? " "Where is Richard?" No, Robert. "Where is Robert?" He: 'Outside. In the freezer. " Excuse me. Is that place free? 1050 euros, sir. Bet now. Bet placed. No more bets. Four, black, even, manque. No winners. Bet now. I'm going to the cashier. Bet placed. No more bets. 17, black, odd, manque. Bet now. That chair is occupied. Does not it surprise you to see me? - Well. My friend is at the checkout. Go away. Is he really your friend? - Who pays is my friend. Then we can meet again. 13, black, odd, manque. - Go away, you bring bad luck. Hey. With Eva. Leave your number. With Bertrand. We have each other seen yesterday in the casino. 06-03-10-53-88. It is beautiful. What? - The weather is nice. Philippe, Théo. Put it here. This is Mathis, the director. This is Bertrand. Slept well? I lost track of time. Sorry, it's Caroline. When are you coming? Only on weekends. I have too much work. Unfortunately. We can meet in the chalet, to refresh your memory. Hold on, say. - Okay, I'll stop. By which? - bother you. See you. Take the decor piece with you. Tighten. And again. That's good. You see, it will be fine. - But the decor still has to be different. Sorry. That is Caroline again. Did you call? - Eva? I can go at four o'clock. Does that fit? The address is rue de l'Etraz 12. Noted. - Four o'clock. Rue de l'Etraz 12. Fine. Bye. Tighten. Just a little. Good. Thanks, guys. Hello, come in. Can I take your coat? Do you want something to drink? - Gladly. This is the waiting room. Champagne? Is that included? - Excuse me? Is the drink included in the price? What is your rate? 300, including champagne. Why are you looking at me like that? - You should not make a make-up. Do not you like it? - You would be much nicer without it. That is not true. I feel ugly without make-up. Champagne or not? Are you here to show me that? You asked for it yourself. A little though. I have not treated you properly. I sometimes skip when I feel humiliated. And then will your men beat their skull? Once in a while. They will come back again. That will be best. But not one day. I do not follow anyone, so not now. Why do not you stop? - By which? With the customers. I have to live? Sand about it? - Yes. Are you just talking? Because then you are wasting your time, and mine. It is great for you alone. It's from a friend of my husband. Your man? - My husband, yes. What is he doing? - He is an art dealer. His name is Georges. And where does Georges live? - A little everywhere. He is constantly traveling. He is an expert. Very reputable. Does he know what you are doing? - You do not care about that. I have to go back to the theater. - What theater? My play was a success in Paris. We're doing it here tonight. 'Mots de passe'. Did you hear about it? That is the title. No, but. I did not think that... - What? You do not really seem like a theater person. I can prepare a ticket for you. If you promise that it will not be boring. - I need to know your name. Eve. No more? Eve. Marlin. Maybe until tonight. It starts at 8.30 pm. Let's meet fifteen minutes earlier. As compensation. Thanks. Do you really want no champagne? - The next time. Did not Eva Marlin have been? No, her card is still there. It looks good. Out of stock. With Bertrand. I've been waiting for you. Really? But I had not promised anything? I could not. Why not? Why why why? That's what a child says. Georges was suddenly there. Oh yeah. Georges. Yes, he was on his way to Singapore. He often suddenly falls in, fine. I have to work. How do you like me? Very enthusiastic. What are we doing? Are you hungry? Is something wrong? - No. This was in the bathroom. Fake. Your girlfriend has a bad taste. It's not my girlfriend, if you want to know. You would not believe me. - Indeed. I do not want them in my house. Shoot it? Can not I read it? - No, they're notes. Do you want? - What is it? When can I read it? Surprise. This is piping hot. Are you sleeping? You talked in your sleep. - What did I say? Everything. What then? - Nothing. And? That boy with memory loss? Did you continue? I have a better idea. Decide quickly or you will soon be unemployed. It's about a prostitute in a provincial town. Exciting, you know. - She is name and fame. She meets a man who falls for her. Have you caught a whore? - Can I finish it? Go ahead. He soon discovers that she is ice cold. Calculating. She is lying, is selfish. He wants to beat her on her own property. How? So you find it interesting? Continue. He wants her to fall in love. - Such women do not fall in love. Exactly. That's what the public thinks. Does he know how to bow or not? What do you think? Can I start? One month. I'll give you one month. What is her name? Eve. Choukri. Marlin. Loiset. You look bad. - No you. How is your stomach? An endoscopy must be done, but it is a lot of hassle. You do not believe the waiting list. A stomach ulcer is nothing here. What are you taking? - I take it how it is. How are you? Do you eat? - Yes. In the cafetaria. Have you seen Marion? - We're going to have lunch soon. She knows a police commissioner. A customer? - Yes I think so. And? Nothing. She said it might help. Did you hear anything from Santini? - Yes, he is confident. As long as you pay him. How long do you want to do this? I have to go. I do not like to drive in the dark. She: 'I do not follow anyone, so not now either. ' He: "Why do not you stop?" She: "With what?" He: 'With the customers.' She: 'I have to live?' She: "With what?" He: 'The customers.' She: 'I have to live?' I have to live... You talk in yourself. Yes, I write that. - Look at that. What? It is flat. You'd better. I told you to wait. - You were right. It is too much of a first layer. The second layer comes later. It is the third layer. The third layer? Yes. From the first to the second, and back to the first: the third layer. Does Régis say that? The third layer. Just like in 'Mots de passe'. That's yours? And it is a success. What do you want from me? I'm going to get food. It can take a while. With Bertrand. Can we meet? I'm busy. I'll take you out for dinner. Good? Well? - Good, but I choose the restaurant. 500 for the whole evening. Exclusive of VAT? Just kidding. At six o'clock with me. We take my car. See you later. Nice dress. Thank you. Did you expect something slutty? Yes, I admit it. So I know you badly. I do not like driving in the evening. Then I see it badly. - Do I have to take over the steering wheel? Health. That is yours. - Thank you. I am attached to it. He is worth a lot. It is a gift from Georges. Funny, I often come here with him. Is he still traveling? - Yes, it does not stop. Horrible. And you? Do you travel a lot? - No, I have a fear of flying. Does he really have no idea what you are doing? You have already asked that. - It intrigues me. He could finish me. And you? Whether I'm jealous? Do you live alone? Yes. - I do not believe you. You probably have someone. - No. Do you really have to do this? - Other subject, please. Waiter? - Madam. The féra des Tresoms. - That's the specialty of the house. Can we order? I'm hungry. The féra des Tresoms is delightful. Then I take that. How about the chariot de Savoie for dessert? I still want a bottle of wine. Sure? Charms, and beyond? - Charms-Chambertin. Oh yes, Charmes-Chambertin. That's what I would like to be called. Is Eva your real name? - Of course not. But my last name is Marlin. What do you care about my name? I am almost dry. Do you often go out with your customers? To a restaurant? It happens, but not often. Usually they want to deal with it quickly. And I. It is something different with you. Something? - That is not bad. I looked up your name on the internet. Oh yeah? - You are really known. I really regret it that I was not with the piece. Because of Georges? - Well. I'm afraid I'll fall asleep. Another time. Sir, your charms-Chambertin, 2005. Domaine Castaldi. I can not possibly drive. And you? Do not want to ask whether they have a room? He can hardly walk. You are just like the others. You only think of one thing. Do not go away. Do not leave. Stay. Do not go away. My husband, you are so far away. My head is exploding. We have... - What? No, I had known that. I still sleep. What are you going to do? - Coffee. Do you also want? - I said I wanted to sleep. And there is only one man in my life and that's Georges. I did not ask anything. - I want it to be clear. You do not stand a chance. But if you want to make love, you can. You paid for it. Do not just attach to me. Was everything as desired? - Definitely. I have to go to Annecy. Can you call a taxi? Certainly, M. Valade. Go ahead. Payment completed. "I want it to be clear. Michel is my life. You do not stand a chance. But if you want to make love, you can. You paid for it. " He: 'Do you like me?' Do you like me? "I know you like me. I know.' Where are you? With friends. With whom? You do not know them. You lie, but it will. - You went away. Not true. I left you behind. I miss you. When are you coming back? End of the week. Maybe sooner. I went to bed with Régis. Did you really go to bed with him? - No, idiot. Do you still want to get married? "Mots the passe." Beautiful title. And further? - No bad word about you, Bertrand. And your next play? That gets shape. A comedy? - Not really. I have trouble with pure comedy. - Henri loves Chekhov very much. "Your cherry garden is sold to pay off your debts. The sale takes place on 22 August. But no worries. You can go to bed quietly. " Henri has a very strong memory. I would have liked to have made theater. Oh yeah? As a writer? - No. As an actor, of course. I often think that an operating room and have a theater agreement. Yes, the operating theater. Shall we talk about the wedding? When? June? - I'm okay with it. Then we go for June. - Good for me too. What a ball, that marriage. I do not ask you as a witness. - Are you doing it for your peace of mind? For the money? To bother me? Sometimes I think you're someone could kill. Was that all? - No. I have advanced you 20,000 euros, but not seen anything yet. How are you doing? Eva is attached to me. And you? - What's up with me? I'm crazy I pay you for that whore. I did not force you. You do not have a letter yet on paper, eh? You just take me in the sting. Does that actually mean Eva? I doubt it. Is that you, Bertrand? Why are not you saying anything? Do you hear me? When can we meet? Not for tomorrow. I am completely full. Do you have time at the end of the morning? - Half past five. OK? Are you in Paris? - See you tomorrow. And... How is she? Who? - She. That Eve of you. Still interested? How old is she? I do not care. - Older than you? Younger than you in any case. I send you her contact info. You never know. Mme Marlin? Mr. Santini can you received in five minutes. Georges has half of his sentence served. He can release conditionally. Who determines that? - The criminal judge. A probation officer will guide him. Does he stand a chance? - He must first find work. He has connections. - I believe that right away. But he is not allowed to do anything more as an antiquarian. An art gallery? - Not at all. I know a printer in Paris. A printer? He does not know anything about that. Photocopy, reprography, 3D. You can learn that quickly. Would you like to find that work? We have to find someone who wants to accept an ex-detainee. That is really not easy. Do you accept cash? - No problem. How is Marion doing? Very well. I'll see her soon. - Give her the warm greetings. I will certainly do that. Did you hang that mirror? No, it was already there. Even the ugly ones like to look at themselves. I would like to get to know your husband. - You might like him. Everyone loves Georges. It often makes me angry how they run after him. While he really is not easy. He can be very violent. - Really? One morning he gave me a blow. He said he had a nightmare. He's a little crazy. I expect someone, so you have to go. Had that been said. He is coming very quickly. You can wait, if you want. You still had a return ticket? My train leaves in an hour. - Then it makes no sense. We can be friends. - Too much hassle. I can take you on a journey. - Where to? I do not know. Ever been to Venice? - Yes, with Georges. Long ago. Would you be sad if he was dead? - Intense. I do not want to see you anymore. With me. Who do I speak with? Do we know each other? Does not tell me anything. Today I work somewhere else. Possibly tonight. Just hold on. I'll be back at seven. Is that good? Have you never been with me? Where did we agree? Which can. Rue de l'Etraz 12. All right then. See you tonight. Eva? - Yes? Thierry. Do you drink something? - I have little time. Shall we go? - That's fine, though. No, I pay my own drinks. Room 12. - Yes sir. Marion? Where are you? Yes, there I am. I did not have time to eat. Do you want? - No thanks. Thierry seen? A quick, is not it? Less than a quarter of an hour. - Ideal. What shall we do? - I only have an hour. What is it? - No idea. I feel that I am being followed. Who are you? I am Jean-Louis. We have an appointment. Jean-Louis? This morning, over the phone. Are you with the car? - Yes why? What is it for car? - A black Clio. Why did you follow me? What do you want from me? You are mistaken, but it does not matter. They said you were serious. Good evening. Wait a second. I open up. From whom do you have my name? A friend. He wants to remain anonymous. He is going to marry. My most customers are married. Will I come? This is the waiting room. Like the doctor? - I often think so too. How much is it, doctor? - 300, including champagne. Pay in advance. Jean-Louis. You are my first customer with that name. Cheers. Did you really not drive on the highway? - No not at all. Strange. I am on my way. I'm from Belgium. You are Belgian? - No, it is not. Good. Shall we then... Not yet. - Why not? Can you keep a secret? I find it exciting to talk to someone that excites me. The rest does not interest me. I find it rather flat, actually. - Every one's own. Are you married? - Dear help, no. No one on the eye? I was so stupid to fall in love with a young woman who loves another. So cliché. - It occurs. Do you really want to undress? To resist the sentences. I once had sex with her. Only once. - See. She did it despite herself. Despite himself? How do you mean? Without wanting it. - You say that. She is very young. Much younger than me. Age does not matter if you can each other. Do you have a regular clientele? - For the most part, yes. All ages? Much of your age. But also younger. Very young? - Young. No children. Not yet, at least. You are not a child, are you? Or is it? A little? Forward. I'll let you sleep. You are dead. May I embrace you? No, I walk with you. You have become skinny. - Well, because I got a belly. I think of you all the time. I have submitted my release request. Santini is looking for a job for you. - I'll do everything, if I can leave here. 'La Noce chez le photographe.' What is the name of that painter again? A double name. I forgot. Dagnan-Bouveret. He is indeed not so well known. Why do you ask that? No idea. I think it's a beautiful painting. Marlin, the time is up. It will do us good. It will do us good. Yes, the fresh air. Forget about the stage. It comes when it comes. I'll finish it. When we get married, We must go on a honeymoon. Yes, people do that. Where to? Have you never been to Venice? Is not that a bit cliché? - That's right. Oh yes... the third layer. - That's how it is. Then we go to Venice. But I arrange everything. Everything? Really everything? - Everything. Yes, Alban? What? When? The last time I saw him, he seemed... I'm coming. Régis has become unwell. According to Alban, it is serious. Where is he? I ask my father to stop by. When will the first train go to Paris? Do you want me to go along? I open up. You did not want to see me anymore? Pay me later. I have a bath on. Are you busy? - Three this morning. Not bad. Am I there? - No, you're the fourth. Come now. I have thought and I think it's good. What? - Venice. I am very tired. It will do me good. Look at me. I look awful. Do you want to sleep in the chalet tonight? Do you remember? Hell yes. And you? A black hole. He did not save it. Where are you, Bertrand? Can you bring cigarettes? And the Paris Match. That is sweet of you. You knew she would come back. Did you do that on purpose? Well? Take me home. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Caroline. Leave a message. Sir? You can not stay. An accident happened. It is now 600 euros. I've come to kill you. Very nice, though. Wait here, I'll be right. Enter here. He was lucky that you found him. Never come see me again. Never again. Do you come? Marion is waiting for us. Who is that? Nobody. P2P Subtitles: Rik the Best
