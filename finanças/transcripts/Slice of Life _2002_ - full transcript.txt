I've always dreamed of this day. It hasn't been easy. I had to find him, seduce him, love him, discover him, be sure and keep him. It hasn't been easy at all. Very complicated, in fact. It all started like this… He's the groom. What do you think? Well, it's a top quality product. -Who is the deceased? -Me. I'd like to ease my family's burden. Can I pick the colour? Yes, the colour and the wood. We can varnish it, wax it, paint it and ceruse it too. Why not a nice lacquer job? -White lacquer? -Too pretentious. Ceruse isn't bad. Yes, ceruse. Green ceruse. Sea-green. Hello. This was made especially for you. -We forgot the handles. -Chrome-plated. No, brushed metal. Much better, isn't it? It's all a matter of taste. Once I die, I'll call you. Must the texts be totally religious? I've brought some I like that aren't necessarily Catholic. Marie, we should discuss this with the groom, Pierre. -I need to meet him. -Of course. Before he stands next to you on the big day. Is the music the same? I mean, how tolerant are you? Do you accept a lot? I have this thing here… You see? That's what I want. I'm not a fatalist, I'm a fighter. But this battle's over. Can you turn it off? Does Marie know? I've spent my life looking for this man. To face the future with. A sound man. A man who reassures me. A man with balance. Head north, feet south. A man full of life. Excellent! We were on the same wavelength. Thanks, Michel. See you tomorrow, Pierre. See you tomorrow, Michel. -Okay, love? -Great, love. -Why's he here? -No idea. A problem, doctor? Not at all, Pierre. I've come over about the test results. What tests? Marie asked me to test your parents for compatibility. -All right. -Your mother's heart's too weak. And your father's too old. Why did you do it, Marie? I won't let them sacrifice themselves for me. -Marie, you're A, Pierre's O… -It's no good. Look, you know I love you. But did I ever ask you to do this? Did my lips say, "Do this for me, Marie"? Consider everything. So consider Paul. No. Paul is not the answer but he just might be. So go and ask your brother nicely. You don't dare to? No. No, it's not timidity, it's hatred. Okay, Pierre? Fine, Nénesse. Well? 1015 millibars. It'll last all week. We'll see. No worries. Good to see you. All set! Go back there right now. Paul, I'm Marie. Pierre needs to talk to you. I'm getting out. Hello. So this is where you live. Nice place. Isn't it, Pierre? Really. A nice Italian-style place here in Rennes… Just wait till it's finished. We're here for one specific reason. I need a bit of liver. I need a liver transplant. From a live donor. A deceased one's two years' wait. Deceased? A dead one. And I only have four months left. At the most. As my brother, you're compatible. There. I wouldn't do it for you. That's for the ten years without calling. Don't worry, you've got your liver. He's always had his own way. -That's settled? -It's settled. The same one! Elisabeth's. I'm always on the roads, I need a real car. Brand new? A guy's judged on his car and shoes. Gym class today? What about his liver? Well, your liver? Just tell me where, when and how. I'll be there. Thanks, I guess. You're welcome. See you at the op? That went well. I need to think about it. The scallops look too thick. Gimme mom's cookbook. "Thinly sliced". What's "thinly sliced"? Can't she give it in inches? She always leaves you part way. It drives me mad. All right, I'll slice them! Salty enough? -Yuk! -That's vague too. "A pinch". "A pinch". It drives me mad. Yeah? Sort of, yes. Whenever you want, okay. Eight? Make it six fifteen. You want croissants with my liver? Screw Professor Choiseul's schedule! Eleven then? Sorry, I forgot I had to give some liver to my estranged brother. No, I have to be in Dinard by one. Yes, I do! Fresnel, my boss. I've topped 30%. He wants to congratulate me at eight. -No! -Right! Hold on, I have a life. We're not all drunk divorcees. Anyhow, we've won the bathroom Jacuzzi! Dad, soccer! Dad, let's go! We'll be late. -Stop it! -Let's go. -Give me the ball. -Drop it, shithead. Thanks, it's not for me. It's crazy, you reach 200 without realizing. I want to know when I do. My wife says it's her or the car. I love my wife. Maybe he can't find the place. Did you give him directions? -Yes, yes. -We'll just wait, then. Wait? I may be busy. I only have four months left. It's not that precise. I know. Four but it could be two. We have Paul now. No, we don't have him yet. -You never told me about him. -I'd forgotten him. Marie, look at the sky. It's beautiful. Beautiful. It'll make a nice change. A Mercedes can be a bit sedate. I never do down another manufacturer's cars but it's true, a Mercedes is sedate. BMW is a whole new ballgame. It's less stale. You're right to try. The 3-litre model will show you. It's a rocket! Hello? Yes? Yes. Yes, I know. Yes, Mr. Fresnel, it's less than planned. Maybe seawater spas are less popular. The place is never packed when I go. I don't see the boom's effects. The sector's slow. It's hard to flog Spa-weed. I'll keep at it. Good bye Mr… Fresnel, reaming my ass out… Is my suppository ready? -He won't do the op. -Choiseul? He will. I don't trust Paul. We're asking a lot of him. Of Choiseul? -When you do it, it's funny. -You hate Paul! I don't. I quite like him. Why are you lying? -I can tell you're lying. -I'm not, I like him. Maybe he's ashamed he didn't turn up. -But he could still do it. -You think so? Yes. I suppose nothing obliges him to do it. I've been saying that all along. He has to be able to refuse. Marie, let's find him. He may be in a bad way. If that's what you want… With these figures, you get the umbrellas. For the golf bag, you have to take 20 grand of bath relaxant. Isn't seawater therapy booming? We're not fighting off custom. I'd gladly take more but I have to sell it. Just in time for a seafood overdose. -Fuck! -What's wrong? You know them? They're people. The chick's hot. Sort of warm, I guess. No way, she's hot! My brother. And his wife. You have a brother? -He's taking treatment? -For shit stirring. So… Serge, hey! Excuse me for a second. -Okay, Paul? -Yes. Why? We wondered how you were since you didn't turn up. I couldn't. Set another date. Another date? His surgeon operates around the world. Calm down. We'll go tomorrow. Or next week. This is the peak season for me. We could have lunch but I'm here on business, so no. 40 grand over there. Coming. Serge, you have to tell them you're selling professional stuff. Here. You and your brother can't eat at separate tables! We see a lot of each other. Thank you, Sonia. -You're doing a great thing. -Only natural. No, it's not, it's admirable. -Which organ? -Just a liver graft. Fuck… The liver? They don't remove it. Think about it! You only have one. They work from a small slice. You jerk. The liver's self-regenerating. It grows back. -Really? -That's the great thing about it. Meet Choiseul tomorrow to get acquainted. It'll only take an hour at the most. -You'll get it over with. Tomorrow? -No. We have a working dinner. -I'll be a wreck tomorrow. -Go, I understand. Stand by your brother. It's all to your credit. -Don't mention it. -I can go alone. No, you can't miss a working dinner. Whatever. A blood test makes me weak so I understand you. A liver… We'll see about it tomorrow. I'll see you there? -We're taking a room here. - We can go together. I'll hold a room for you. You'll be together. Together's nice. Like hell. I told you so. He's chickening out. Only 30 minutes late. Your brother's a shit. Let's go home. What a bastard. The bastard! Come on, let's go home. What are you up to? Let's go! He can't see Choiseul like that. -What kind of dinner was it? -Get off my back. -Are you ready? -Here, have a mint. -No, it's okay. -Paul, please, have a mint. Are we pissing in the wind or going? What the fuck? Jesus, the bastards! The jealous fuckers! What shit country is this? Tell me I'm wrong. She ran out of patience. Is she nuts or what? You don't attack a car! Out of patience so she trashes my car! She didn't know it was yours. Did it have to be this one? That Citroen's a doddle to smash. I'm gobsmacked. Fuck! Five grand in repairs. Pierre, get in. You'll catch cold and ruin your suit. Not a bad idea. Why? It's a bit naff. It's not naff, it's trendy. Yeah, naff trend. No, really, Paul, this isn't naff. Naff is… Your outfit. The salesman style. Pure, unadulterated naffitude. That's lucky because I am a salesman. Pierre looks like some prelate about to come out. Marie, please… Let's go. I should go with him. Come with me, Marie. Hey, I'm not the one who needs the liver! Don't try to shake us off, I'm here. Just a little race… I'll be sick. Stomach transplant? Want a piece? -Have a kidney too. -Keep the brain. Drive properly and cut this crap. Pierre's a sick man. Dying even. You little joker. Come on… -Stop! -I'm going too fast! Double declutch and power surge! I've fucked him! We've fucked him, right? The way you ask for a bit of liver, you've got no future in sales. I mean, there must be some risk. For me… It's nothing compared to Pierre's zero chances of survival. He lost ten years when you stole his wife. Give him a year now. We're on first name terms so how about a fuck? That's that over. We still use first names? We avoid one another. This patient had a transplant just last week. Okay, Mr. Lussan? Fine, thank you, doctor. The graft's taken well. You'll go home soon. I'll be back in. He's doing well. I didn't know him before. You'll meet our nurses. They'll look after you. Come along. Come and see. It's in this area. We take about 60%. What? 60%? That's crazy, he'll end up with more liver than me! Why 60%? Why not 50-50? Or 60-40: 60 for me, 40 for him. I mean, I'm the donor. You can't just give what you want. Doctor, the eyes… No, here. Look into my eyes and tell me. Is there a risk? For me. A risk of dying? I'd rather know the truth about this. It'll help me. Yes, there's a risk. There's always a risk. Can't be! We're gonna do it… Give me a figure. One in a thousand. One in a thousand. With my bloody luck… Okay, I'm with you 100%. But things have changed. You listen to me now. How big's the scar? Small, average or big? Nine to twelve inches. Nine or twelve? Nine at least. Okay. -Where? Show me. -Under the swimsuit. Be precise! Show me! Come on, I won't bite! Here. That's not the swimsuit. I don't swim in a tracksuit! Tell you what. Another thing. It's a general anaesthetic…. A general anaesthetic, right? Right. So how's this for an idea. Give me liposuction at the same time on this flab here. I can't get rid of it. I mean, I'll be out. -Is that a dumb idea? -Yes, but only natural. How about my appendix? Schedule a day for tests sometime. The usual check-up. -We don't want you two to die. -Forget it. -You're doing a good thing. -It's not easy. This is my busiest time of the year. Didn't they tell you? Don't worry. I make all the decisions around here. Okay, we're gonna do it… A tracksuit at the beach will turn the chicks off. Is it going to hurt? -You'll get painkillers if needed. -I'll need them! I hate pain. I want them on my bedside table. Around the clock! -Are you all right? -What's wrong, Paul? Yeah… We're gonna do it. You don't do the check-up at home? You have everything here. You need to downscale it all. What a day! We're gonna do it. We'll manage somehow. See ya! Doctor… -Doctor… -He's your donor. Go easy on him. I can still call things off. Understand? Yep. HEPATOLOGY - PR. CHOISEUL One thing bothers me. We're gonna do it. -But not with Choiseul. -What? Not with Choiseul. I don't trust him. 35, good-looking… His speciality is chicks. I want a mature surgeon. I'm a patient, not a frog. He's the leading specialist for Pierre's problem! In theory, maybe. But this is practice. Well… We'll see. We'll test him with my check-up. We'll decide after. Want to visit another floor? There's no "after". It's Choiseul and right away! A world-renowned surgeon… working in Rennes? Doesn't that bother you? I guess I must be dumb. You keep saying that. Let's keep it that way. What the hell's going on? He's clocking out! Show some respect. See you. Paul, tell me. Would you mind if I came with you? Where? On your sales rounds for a week. What for? I don't know… To make the most of it. The most of what? I don't know… being together. Do you mind? Frankly, yes. I don't have time to look after you. What about your Gay Pride stock? I can look after the shop. It would just be brothers together. It'll do you good. You look exhausted. It's funny, this sudden concern, this torrent of love washing over me… It's weird, I'm not used to it. Just pretend I'm not there. You won't even notice me. Hey! It's sunny. It'll cloud over later. A depression. -New car? -No, the same as before. I just slapped on bigger tyres and cow bars. A train ran over the tip of your shoes? Fuck, the mummy's return! -Paul, no! -Yes! Don't start. Just a second, Paul. I didn't know you were here. Oh, damn. It's the emotion. You were here? We haven't seen you in ages. How are you, lad? What's new? Still gangbanging? Got a start-up? No, just here to do the lawn as usual. -You're here, then. -No, I'm a hologram. -A what? -We'll get them. -Who? -My ass! -We're late for Dinard. -Dinard again? Choiseul buggered my plan. One: customer needs. Two: sales pitch. Three: order. Then you kick the potato tree and gather up the spuds. Your bag, Pierre! Don't start again. What is this? You want to wreck the whole BMW fleet? Mercedes next? Got a question? He's yours. I'm trusting you. He's all yours. Did you make him do a pee? See you, boys! Go and get fucked. Sorry… You're not cold? What's up? Not talking? Nothing to say. We can't spend a week in silence! "Pretend I'm not there." So I'm pretending. I see. Right… That's gross! Don't worry, I'll eat it after. Stop it, damn it! I'm pretending I'm not here. -I'm all alone in my room. -This is going to be fun. Eight days that'll feel like eight years! Shit! It's raining. A long time since you laughed. Shower in fifteen minutes. Don't be late, this place has rules. It'll do you good. Stand on tiptoe. -Not too strong? -It's okay. -Feels good, doesn't it? -So good! Sideways on now. Face me. -Feels good, doesn't it? -Yep… Spa-weed… Four, five… Nice and easy. Six, seven… Sorry, I was having a massage. All right, Henri, go to your place. Now slowly raise your arms to work on the joints. Never push yourselves to the limit. All right? Let's go. Work on it, nice and easy. What's next? That's good. Lower your arms. Lower your arms now, nice and easy. Now face each other. Slowly bend your knees. Too fast, Pierre, you'll hurt yourself. Stand up straight. Take deep breaths. Now let's jump. Lift your arms like a bird. Do the bird now. Maybe I could get you more favourable terms. I'd do that if I were you. Don't forget the kids' parkas. See you tomorrow. I'm beat. Good night. Your bed's not that way. I know. But I heard a noise. Go into your room. Go into yours. -You go. -Why me first? See you tomorrow. Why aren't you going in? Are you going back out? I just didn't hear your door close. -So you're going out? -No. What's it to you anyway? I'm not your wife. If you go out, I'm coming. I'm not! I'm going out. So if you are too, let's go together. Are you going out? -You were. -No, I'm not. I'm on business. A working dinner? What're you doing? I'm not going out. With you. It's a classic model. Dominant and dominated. One pup suckles more than the others. -It's natural law. -Oh yeah? -Natural selection. -Right. There's loads of examples. Brothers can have disastrous relationships. Cain and Abel, Romulus and Remus… One always gets it. Are we here to party or not? Great, it's open. -Hey! -Hello! -How are you? -Evening, Paul. -Okay, you crook? -Hi, babe. -What is this? -Never seen a bar before? I've got a surprise for you. You go with hookers? It's just a pal's bar with girls. You think girls are dirty? He's a pimp with hookers! A pimp, hookers… You're always so precise! Paul, what's up? You stole Elisabeth to cheat on her with hookers? You fucker! Nothing finds favour in your eyes. You hate me. Why should I help you out? Give me a reason to get myself cut open. A good, humane reason. I don't know. You'd be… You'd be a decent guy. And? And that's it. Right. So people would talk and say, "Paul's a decent guy." That won't be enough. Think of something else. Okay, here you go. You have to because your life's pathetic. You've given Elisabeth a shitty life. With you, she'd be bored shitless. Want a pee? Come and have a pee. It hurts here? You asshole. With me, Elisabeth's had a life, kids and good laugh! You can't get your last three months right. Watch it! You're broke, so behave or you're out. Everything's fine. -Who's this cow? -Shut up! No, hey! Calm down! -Take it easy! -Fucker! Pain in the ass! Take that, fucker! -He's my brother. -And a pain in the ass. That's twice now… He is a pain… Fuck off! What did I tell you? Stop it! Calm down! Open this fucking door! Don't ever come back here! And stuff your order up your ass! You pathetic bastard. It's great taking you out. No sweat at all. That makes up for the times at the pool. I was frozen, you kept pushing me in. It pissed me off. We can say nice things for a change. Then get nasty again. You've got something that I want to get in one piece. -Your liver? -Yeah. I'd forgotten all about that. Change your tone, you fat slob, if you want it. Remember all those magic words: "please", "thank you", "goodbye"… I want a kiss too. A kiss. Here! I didn't feel that. I'm your brother, not some pal. It's only natural. A kiss, a bit of liver, a kiss… Gimme a kiss. I didn't expect that. Why did you do it? What? Elisabeth. A week before the wedding. Enough, okay! Fuck, my suit! Spa, order, the road… No sweat. I'll wait till Friday. That's great. I'll get him a toy car. Give them my love. Right, yeah. Me too. See you Friday. It's me. Fine. No, I slept really well. He's being nice. How's the shop? That's not great, is it? It's the slack period though. No, really nice. Perfect, in fact. Lots of love. No, really nice, I promise. Love you. Everything okay? -Fine. And you? -Fine. How do you find Marie? What I want to know is how did you find her? She's great, I guess. Upstanding, determined, focused. A ball-buster. -Granny had one of those. -Shut up… Stand on tiptoe. Sideways on. Hand behind your neck. Face me. -Feels good, doesn't it? -It does! Close your eyes and turn to your inner world. In this comfortable position, floating in warm seawater… Help! Help! Let me out! Julie, try using a bit of… I'm going to add a Spa-weed trace element compound. Spa-weed. Say it again. Say it again, Julie. -Does this stuff work? -It's professional stuff. "Spa" for this place and… It's lovely. Spa-weed. "Weed", for seaweed. You've seen seaweed before. What's in it exactly? Essential oils, borage, it's good. There's not just borage. It's a compound… with… It's a draining compound. I remember now. It cleans the skin and removes toxins. It's good. It stinks a bit. It smells of the sea! You keep trying to show me up today, Julie. You need to learn the stuff in the brochures. I'll leave you now. You're in good hands. Learn the stuff, okay? Feels good, doesn't it? -His parents adopted me. -You look alike. Know that thing about having a clone one day and how you can replace faulty parts from it? Right. That day's here. I'm his clone. He's using my parts. -He follows you everywhere? -Not me. -His liver. -Sambuca? Cheers. It's nothing. Just a stitch. The liver's fine. Don't start imagining things. -I came along for the fun of it. -The fun of it? You haven't laughed since I flunked my exams. 5 a.m. I need some sleep. I love winding him up. He hasn't got the keys. Julie wants to talk about borage. -At this time? -They start early here. A liver massage will do you good. -What will I tell Marie? -Do something first. There you go. What will I tell Marie? You'd been drinking. Do you ever drink? I did after you took Elisabeth. Christ, you're obsessed! It's not your fault, okay? That's how I fucked up my liver. I drank too much. It's my own fault. I didn't steal her. We're in love, we have two kids. My first sleepless night since you took her. Don't start. I looked for you all night. Do we have to talk about this? Just once would be good. Stop cracking my nuts, okay, I'm driving. Feels good, doesn't it? Yeah… -Pierre Venturi? -Yes. About that… Hang on a sec. Enough's enough! No more spa treatment! -It's not doing you good? -Can't you tell? -Calm down. -No way! This is crazy! Four months to live and my brother makes me fuck my masseuse at 6 a.m. Shut your mouth. Take time out to think about this. It's totally crazy. We're in Bathrobe Land! -Calm down! -I'm going home. I'm out of here. Is there a problem? No. Meet my brother. -There is a problem. -There isn't! There is. You display us badly. -I'm sorry? -Very badly. Paul likes you but, believe me, Spa-weed will pull out. With the licence and supplies. Your competitor sells more and wants exclusive rights. Please, shut up. But if you get exclusive rights, you'll get a share in profits. I'm talking in kilo-francs, while you deal in trace-francs. Why didn't you say? I didn't want to rush you. What I can offer you is to set a basic order with exclusive local rights and regular up-dating. We can't undersell state-of-the-art goods. Let's discuss it over a working dinner. No working dinners. We have an early meeting. Over there. To take everything away. Or give them it all. Let's settle it in my office. -Were you in weed therapy? -Well… With Christelle. She had it on too high. You're brilliant! 120 grand! We're gonna party tonight, big time! How can we party more than we are? I've aged ten years in four days. Can't we get bored for once? No, I want to set a score. They'll call me the Butcher. -A score? -Yeah, I'm red-hot. They'll stop asking for more and cry for mercy. Talking about your dick doesn't make it more real. Neither does never talking about it. I'm hotter than a chilli pepper. My body's a creeper! I've got some bad news. Well, not that bad. I can't get back this weekend. My meeting in Biarritz is set for Saturday. Right. Hold on, Elisabeth, you know Biarritz is important. Who? He's not here. Okay, just a second. Elisabeth wants a word. Yeah? That's sweet of you. I'm fine. I'm fine. Really. Yeah. Listen… That's sweet of you. Take care. Here. -Listen, he's here but… -She hung up. -Why didn't you tell her? -Why did Marie? She never guessed you didn't. I didn't want to worry her. You don't know her. I do, a bit. You may well end up with a deceased donor. You're fucking up my life to live. I'll talk to Elisabeth. Two pills for you. And a shovel full for me. -The same car as yesterday… -You can drive. Watch the right-hand pedal, it speeds the car up. I'll decide where we go to party! You're not a regular here. I'll be right back. Slow down, okay? You love me, huh? I'll offer them exclusive rights in Biarritz. -I wouldn't do that. -Shut it. All right. What would you do? It's not just technique. You need to learn some tricks. Imagine you're the manager, all set to sign the contract. You're the manager, with the contract and pen, ready to sign. Curtains. What a jerk I am. Now I'm the manager. Go on. -Hello. -Hello, Mr. Dupont. Use his name. Okay? Go on. Hello, Mr. Dupont. -Need anything? -Nope. Curtains. -What a jerk… -Try again. Right! Hello, Mr. Dupont, life's tough these days, isn't it? Very tough. -Curtains. -All right! How do I open? Talk to Mr. Dupont about his spa. Keep it modest, always one step below him. He's in checked cloth? I'm in checked floor-cloth. -He's in Westons? -I'm in Adidas. -He's in Adidas? -I'm in thongs. It's not easy-peasy but you're here with me now, right? Yeah! It's vodka. Okay? Maybe this is my last nightclub. -What was that for? -I may never see you again. -Nothing's sacred, then? -Nothing! Is Elisabeth still clitoral? My fault. I said nothing was sacred. But some things are. You're right. Meet Nathalie. She's studying economics at Rennes. An educated young lady… -Delighted. -Likewise. This is Agnès. She's in primary school. Now we're a foursome. Hello? Did I wake you? I have treatment anyway. We got to bed early but it wears you out. They keep massaging you all over. I feel like I'm 12 yards long and flat. It's doing me good, though. He's into this all the way now. He eats only vegetables, drinks only water, you wouldn't know him. Yes, I miss you too. He'll do it. Right. I love you too. Take care. -Me more than you. -No, me. No, me more than you. Thanks a lot! What's this pigsty? You're crazy… What are you doing? We're going to Biarritz. Biarritz? No way. My best client. You'll work it out in no time. You'll enjoy every minute. No, I told you, I'm not going. You can't dump me! I'm just not a seaweed salesman. I'm totally worn out, see. You are too. We'll stop the treatment. No more seawater treatment, okay? I need you in Biarritz. Come on. You can choose the hotel. I'll let you choose it. Rintintin loves you. That's not funny. Leave me alone. -Is this in the backpackers' guide? -No, it isn't. It's a youth hostel. Sir? Two suites. Talk about the op to impress him. -It impresses me too. -Get dressed. We don't eat with the manager, we're not at his service, we don't owe him a thing. The manager… is a manageress! She's a woman. I wanted it to be a surprise. That's why I kept saying "him". When I introduced you to the manager and she turned out to be a woman, it would blow you away. I'd have got one up on you. It was too good to be true. I didn't see you for ten years because you stifle me! Turn it off. You'll ruin the evening. Thanks, Pierre. A few vitamins. I'm almost out, I need to restock. I won't raise a pup-tent, but a fucking big-top! You have a big dick, go up to primary school. We're happy for you. You should note them all down. -It's a shame to lose them. -Come in. "I've got a big dick, I can pee further than you…" It's earth-shattering. Don't pay attention… You're wearing that? Who cares anyway? Listen. I'm the strategist here. Tell her about the liver op, launch into your sales pitch, then I come up from behind and I shag her. You did business school but this is cock school. And I beat you hands down. She's a real bomb. A quick bang can make me 150 grand. This is real team work. Get dressed. Dress up, I mean. I'm red-hot! No, I like him. And olé! Hello? It's Marie. I'm not with Pierre. It's you I want. -What have I done now? -Nothing. Tell me how he is. He's resting. Stop making fun of me, Paul. We've partied a bit. Only a little. That's why he's here. Don't worry, I'm watching him. Did you tell him to lie to me? I'd never have done that. Are you okay? -I'm okay. -Just okay? I'm fine. I'll let you go now. Bye, Paul. I'm ready. Nice spin! Congratulations. You're very brave. I don't deserve a medal. Let's change the subject. -That's trendy. -Baldness is in. We deal in young designers. You should overhaul Paul, then. What's up with my gear? I love the Madison! Shall we dance? …a dance that came from across the Atlantic! It's brand new! We gather together and dance! Congrats! You did pretty well. It's brilliant. Let's have a pee. We're having a pee. What's going on? Talk to her about work! You're taking in a movie later? Follow the goddam plan, okay! What? You're business. I'm the rest. -You shag her. -That too. Let me do it. We're not here to wash our hands. A request from Mr. Paul Venturi… -What are you doing? -Hush. That was great. I think everyone liked it. It was good. I'm sorry… Yes, it was. -She likes you. -She does? -You shag her. -No way! She's my turnover. She feeds Elisabeth and your nephews who are well, since you ask. Shag her and shag her good. What are women for you? She's only talking to you. Chicks aren't like the weather. They're unpredictable. It must be that dumb suit or your hangdog expression. Keep the hangdog look, it works. I'm not into this… Okay, let's get this straight. You tart things up. I'm common so I'll be common. She's my turnover. Fuck her and I get my order. It's clear. -You don't like her? -She's beautiful. You want my liver? Give me your cock as a loan. You're so vulgar. I can be a lot worse. I'm asking you a favour. And remember, I'm getting a 12-inch scar on my gut. 9-inch. He said nine. Nine or twelve, get out there and do her right for me. Hangdog but not depressed, okay? Emotion but keep her laughing. Smile! -Come on. -No! I'm fucking hot. I have super powers. I feel the flow. Wait. Is it for Paul or for you? Who wants to kiss me? Sorry, I'm so dumb. Really, I'm sorry. -I'll go now. -Stay. Aren't you comfy here? Yes. We can discuss work, nice and peacefully. And maybe I'll blow you after. -You want the blowjob now? -No, I… Paul will be pleased. It's all for Paul. Isn't that beautiful? Basque singing is magical… It's not that important. We can just sleep if you want. Come on. Just a second. It was good. Come on… I get it. You want to wear me out. You want to kill me, get me drunk, make me fuck till I die! I'll die of exhaustion. The perfect crime. You don't want to do the op. -You've changed your mind. -I haven't! I never intended to do it. I'm scared! I'm terrified! I'm shit-scared! You just can't give, can you? You get to decide if I live or die. And I agree to that because I want to live! I'm a slut! Look, I'll fuck your liver up! You're scared too now, huh? Look at this! I want to live. I want to see Christmas! I'm too young. It's not fair. Why should I say goodbye to all this? I can't leave now, I only just got here. I'm sorry, there's no message. I'll do the bill. I believe you're paying. Anything from the mini-bar? Two whiskies, a gin, two vodkas, a Toblerone, two Kit-kats, a Lion bar, I think, peanuts, pistachios, an energy drink. Just about everything in it. No mineral water. He's my brother. Don't do this, okay! Hello! Where the fuck were you? I looked everywhere. I was going to go. Fucking stupid. You looked everywhere but in front of you. You have shit instincts.. You thought I could just take a holiday… What's up? Come on, tell me. Elisabeth's throwing me out. What did she say? Girls need reassuring, okay. I told you that, dickhead. If I didn't go back this weekend, I could stay away. And that I lied to her… That's just her temper. Paul, don't get in such a state. My head's splitting. Paul, get up. I can't breathe. You've killed me. It's okay, forget the op. Just forget it. Come on, get up. Come on, get up! Cut it out. I know what you think, fucker. Get this away from me. I'm fine. I just felt dizzy, that's all. I can't be here, I have to work. I'm not sick, he is. Don't put me out! Not with him in the room! Calm down. I can't stop working. I need money. Before I wake up in the morning, I need 25 grand. Don't worry. I'll help you. It's my fault. It is your fault. You've killed me. I'm generous. I'm not calculating. You should've listened to me, asshole. I could see it coming. I told you I could. Sorry. Make sure I stay alive. Guys like me only come along every 500 years. I'm rarer than a comet. Forgive me. Don't take me to hospital. No, no hospital. They'll take me to an asylum. No hospital. I prefer my shirts on hangers if possible. And trousers? In a ball at the back of the cupboard? -I was kidding. -So was I. The big flower's crushed me four times already. Four lives lost. It's to help you relax. Try to catch them for extra lives. -Move your fingers! Screw the lives. -Okay? Ace! All this rain, water and sea everywhere. So much joy makes me happy. I'm making up for it. Have you heard from my family? Will they pay the ransom? I'm a prisoner here! -I've had enough. -How do I get out? How do I get out? Apart from the sea air, how are you? Like any guy getting over a coronary! A medicinal overdose. -Got the figures? -Excellent. You're up 20%. -Did you go to Le Croisic? -Too far out of my way. -Tomorrow. -That's all I hear! I'd go if I wasn't like this. Sorry, but apart from the job you've given me, I have a small shop to look after. What's all this frantic activity for? -I'm living. -Could have fooled me. -Will sole do? -Unless it's in breaded cubes. Suits me too. You wore that to the meeting? You need to smarten up. Yeah, no worries. Hey. Catch. -A loaned Porsche? -Porsche doesn't loan. -You stole it? -I bought it. You gave me the idea. Cars are fun. They sure are… -Make room of me. -This is the sick man's place! Get out then. -What model is it? -A Boxster. -Not really a Porsche. -More a Porschette. You smoke now? Yeah… Well, no. -You have to talk to Elisabeth. -I can't. You're good with words, you'll talk her round. You owe me that. It's your fault I didn't go home. My fault? You're nuts. Just look at your life. Here we go again. I'm asking you to help me for once. Asking me to help you? Don't you have any limits? Give me the keys back. Am I disturbing you? The kids are at school. You haven't changed. That's sweet. I'll lie too. Neither have you. You even have more hair. -Did Paul send you? -No. I just made some coffee. No thanks. Paul sent you. Don't lie. I'll have a coffee. Talk dirty to me. Grab my tits! Grab my tits! Tighter! Wait! Let me… Feel better now… that you've seen me? I do. -You smoke? -No idea. Everyone says so. -What'll I tell Paul? -How is he? He's getting over it. And I'm fine too. You're here for Paul but couldn't come for yourself. If I had, would you have come back? Of course. Really? Drink wouldn't have fucked my liver… Life's a blast, huh? Get the right person, it's important. This gets me mad. -Ready in five minutes. -Here. -Not bad. -Uh… Yeah. And this. Not all at once. I'll get sloshed. Sit down and take a breather. I'll cut the toes of my shoes off tomorrow, I promise. Come on! I was always the bad son. From birth. Mum needed an episiotomy to get me out. -This is good. -You like it? I never saw you as a cook. I'm pretty sophisticated but I hide under a front of total slobness. Well? -It'll be tough. -Why? She's changed. -What did you think? -She's changed. Shit! Married, two kids… Is there another guy? No, no one else, that's definite. -That's good. -No, it's worse. She's not leaving for another guy but because of you. Sorry but it's worse. Shit, that's a bummer. There's no hope. What? Honestly! I'm just trying to help. I gave her everything she wanted, treated her like a princess… The bitch thought she was one. You can see the kids when you want. Thanks, Pierre. To think I'm not capable of… We'll find you a liver. One fucking big liver. Things were urgent. Now they're critical. He'll be inoperable soon. What can we do? Hope to find a donor fast. I can't, I'm wiped out. I'd do it if I could. -No one's asking you. -I'm more than just a liver! We're talking about Pierre's condition. We'll wait for a liver. We can't wait, we have to find one. Let's hear some winning talk! You sit there on your ass. These guys are useless. Give him yours. You're healthy. I can't. A live donor has to be a family member. -It's the law. -I'll say it was mine. I'll say it was mine. See, I'm not being fussy, I'm trying to help. 5 a.m. The clubs are closing. Plenty of young liver around. We'll make donors up to your turn. Too bad for the others. You need to convince the families. That's my job. We could look for livers full time. If it gets urgent, we'll get more aggressive. Meaning? If we can't save those ahead of you on the list, we'll liquidate them. -You're kidding? -I thought you'd say that. You'll soon change that attitude. Too cautious. We have to slow them down! We'll let fate decide which guy has a smash. It's not fair. Like your case. People are too selfish to be donors. -Marie's great. -What's up? Great for you, moron. Did I sleep long? What a dumb idea. -What's up? -Nothing. I'm very sorry about your son. Motorbikes are hell. I can't hear. What do you want? I want to know if you'd thought about what to do with his organs. Have you talked about it? Talk louder! I understand, you're in shock. I said, was your son an organ donor? Who are you? The insurance company? No, but I didn't feel concerned until my brother needed a liver. What? What d'you want? It would allow my brother to live. Christophe! -What, dad? -Listen to this. Jean-Michel's still warm and this shit wants his liver! Who's this fucker? I was asking if you'd donate it. What's it to you? It's a tough decision, I know. Will you donate it? -He won't give up. -Piss off. Why won't you? -I may well donate it. But not to you. -Why? I don't like the way you ask. It's not right. That liver, I'd give it to anyone but you. -Elisabeth, listen… -Morning. Morning. So, here goes. We did what we did. I have no regrets but we need to talk. -So talk. -Bitch. -Talk to me. -Bitch. Talk some more. I've missed you, bitch. -Tell me more. -Your pussy, your tits. That's good. What else? That's it, I'm over it now. So am I. It doesn't hurt anymore. I don't care anymore. Me neither. Not a bit. -Are you sure? -Yes. Aren't you? Yes I am. I'd like to be really sure. Wouldn't you? I hate you. -Me too. -I loathe you. -I despise you. -You make me puke. I'll try something. Hello. -You can stand me now? -Almost. Hello. So we're friends. -You've made up? -About what? -Is there a drop left? -Here. -Have you made up or not? -We never fell out. It must be me, then. Good, before I go, I want everyone to get along. It's important. Isn't Choiseul overdoing the Prozac? No, I'm happy, that's all. -Why don't we go out? -Now? Of course I mean now. How about a drink in a club? You've turned into a wet blanket! Sorry, Pierre, but I can't keep up. I can't go on giving. I've given too much or done it badly. Good night. -All right? -Good night. How are the figures? Up 20% as usual. Plus 20, a Porsche. You have my old life but better. Funny, I was thinking the same thing about you. Getting any? Yeah, but better. -Go easy, okay. -No. I know I can't shag every woman on earth but I can try anyway. What will I tell Marie? What are you doing? -I was just going out. -Great! No drinks. He doesn't have to drink. Yes I do. It's ages since I spoke to Elisabeth. I could go tomorrow. If you want. It's over for me. It'll be okay. I'm working so much. I'm working… We have to do something. Okay, but trust me. If you don't want to, say no. I don't even know what you mean. What is it? Hello, I'm Marie. -Which one's Pierre? -I am. It's just a first meeting about the liver and the money. No need for money. I do what I want with my liver. -You can have it. -That's settled. We'll get out of your way. -We'll be going. -No, stay. I'm no use to anyone. Maybe my liver can help you. You're O+? Yes. I'm O+ too. What more can I say. The liver's yours. Take it. He said, "It's yours, take it." Here! -Who is this maniac? -I don't know him. Michel Bertin. He was on the Net. I did a web-search on "liver". I found his name. I thought he'd find a liver, not that he'd… You thought it was just organ trafficking. We open him up, take the liver, put it on ice and go. Open him up. We'll damage the liver. Take the lot, sort it later. Here, chef, pretend he's a turkey. What? You do it! Hand it over! Dr Choiseul? Paul Venturi. We have a liver. A dead guy gave it to us. Before dying, he said, "It's yours, take it." It's a gift. It's mine. Screw the procedure. It's a liver. A fucking working liver. Maybe he even ate organic only! -He doesn't believe me. -It's as pink as a baby's. I've stayed calm so far but I'm bloody mad now! Calm down, Paul. If it's any comfort, the liver can save two kids. Great. "Okay, but trust me," she said. Don't be petty. What colour's that? I never liked Bertin. Look where he put all his money. -What a jerk. -He owed me a grand. How much did this coffin cost? -75,000. -What? You paid seven grand for it? We were all Bertin had. -What was that? -She doesn't like the handles. They're not what I ordered. It's mine! It's Choiseul. I didn't feel a thing. In fact, I feel great. I expected worse. Look at this. Incredible, there's no scar. They went in through the urethra. It doesn't hurt a bit unless I press down but it's almost nothing. These doctors are artists but earn less than a soccer player. They didn't do it. What? The op was cancelled. They brought you back. The liver was too small. It saved a kid. Again? I'm going to have a great karma in my next life! I found out it was from Perpignan. I was so happy, I spent a fortune on flowers for everyone who died there yesterday. Dumb idea. Did you send a note? -"Thanks, just in case." -What can you add? I need to feed the parking meter. Paul, you can stay. I don't have good news and bad news. Is it all bad? -We have a liver. -That's good. But it's not of the best quality. -What are the odds? -50-50. That's good. It can go either way. I don't know. If it fails, I get priority. Ahead of kids? That's great. I mean, it's better. Take it. Whenever it's not my liver, he doesn't want it. Mine's no better than any other. Tell us what you really want. We transplant it, yes or no? Do it. I'd gladly give Pierre my liver. How about that! The answer was staring us in the face! I'm scared, Nénesse. I'm scared, old pal. What happened this time? Too small, too big, too boozy, no machinery? Paul's doing well in any case. It fucking hurts! I knew this would be hell! Choiseul's good but what a jerk. There, there. What's wrong? Where's he holed up? Is he away for the weekend? Give me morphine! Thanks, Paul. Shut your mouth! Maybe your liver's not so hot. If I see you drink, I'll smash your face in. I'm closed for trading after this. If you need anything, see someone else. I'm looking at the scar. It's a bloody trident! That's not funny. Cut it out. That's it, I'm married. It was complicated and difficult but I've done it. If you're destined for a man, you end up with him. That's fate. I wanted a reassuring man whom I could face the future with. A calm, easy-going guy. The levelheaded, solid type. And it ended like this. To the newlyweds! Next time, maybe. Shit! Hey, Mr. Kipling! Paul, my boy! -Got a minute? -Sure. Suck my mussel? -You little rascal! Shame on you! -Sorry… Keep your eyes on the road! YOU OWED ME TEN GRAND, TITI… Subtitle translation by: Ian Burley
