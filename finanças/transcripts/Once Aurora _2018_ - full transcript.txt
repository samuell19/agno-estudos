Copyright (C) NRK PROVENCE, FRANCE 2018 {I}Bonsoir,{/I} Ginger. Some days, or nights, I feel that I have no meaning. There are moments when I think it is strange that things cannot be preserved. You cannot grab something and keep it forever Because you will disappear, and it will disappear. It's the best thing about music. It can't die. Every time I make a song, I'm a little lesser. Smaller. Then it's important that you know it was worth it. I have a new plan by the way. The first song I want to begin with is actually "The beauty in Forgotten Love ". Should we give it a try? AURORA has started the recording of the difficult second album Can you tell if I'm cold? If I'm out of daydreams? If I lose what's loved. Will A new love await me? I'm touched by wonder. It needs to be louder . But you drown me in daylight, Don't swim with me, darling. I prefer the Sun When you are away. And I don't care if you don't understand why I cry It's the beauty in Forgotten love. - Ladies and gentlemen. - Please welcome Aurora. Once AURORA {I}The way you got discovered, it's a bit special.{/I} {I}A friend of yours posted one of yoursongs on Facebook, and it went viral.{/I} {I}You left school{/I} {I}and became a pop star overnight.{/I} You want to show the world how beautiful this is. This will work. She hadn't been in the studio before. I didn't think she was ready. MAGNUS Producer / Drummer But I was wrong. It sounds strange. And it was strange to drop out of school to become Aurora in capital letters. 18 years old Aurora became a pop sensation. At the age of 18, Aurora became a pop sensation Two years after she released her debut album. AURORA has been touring for almost a year, and done close to 200 performances. - How are you? - The voice is pretty OK. But no cancelling. I've met fans outside. Now I have to sing. We're only halfway. That's Boston. Look how much we have left. All this. The energy is gone. And I hate to disappoint. Lucky. Aren't we lucky, guys? -Aren't we lucky? -Yes, we're lucky! Odd Martin and Magnus are the two that first met me as an artist. And they played with me from the very first concert. I've never had many friends. For the first time since I was a kid, I felt like I was in a gang. A group of friends. Although it's very demanding of you from time to time, - I don't think you could have lived without it either. You just have to ... ... have the right people around you. That's what it's all about, I think. This is my first job ever. It's an unnatural job for a human to have. And you stand on stage in different cities every day. And people expect it to be your most important and only concert. And so it has to be. Every day. Now Take me home, home where I belong. Now Take me Home, home where I belong. I can't take it anymore. Hi! - Hello my love. Good to see you here in New York. I want you to say hi to Steve from "Howard Stern Show ". You're so good! It feels strange. To be so visible. - Feel good about the show? - Yeah I think so. - Yeah me too. - I think so. I don't like having people so close. I don't like to hug. Don't let it slow you down. - We got to go. - Ok we really need to go. Are we just gonna get you out of here, home and to bed? At some point, you have to go home, and you'll want to do it now. Yes, but right? - I'm going to get you home. - To Norway? I've been wondering for a long time if I really want to be an artist. It was kind of just something that happened. Norway There's a full moon! Dad, there's a full moon! Think so. You want to see? It's strange, really. This year, 2016... It's been the hardest year... in my life in a very long time. And I'm just trying to figure out why still. The truth about me - Is that I'm very home-loving. I'm the youngest of three sisters. I've grown up with the whole family on idyllic Drange. (ed: 40min South of Bergen City, Norway) Far away from the city, in the woods, by the fjord. Where the silence is very high. I traveled when I was 17, and now I'm 20. 90% of all debutantes will yield after one disc. What is the relevance of the music you plan to create now? - I smell my algae ball. - that you...? Do you know what a algae ball is? It's my new pet. Igor Septimus. It lives in water. It is round and can live in 200 years. I smell because I cuddled with him this morning. - Because you...? - Cuddled with him this morning. We have to finish 16 songs. My debut Album and I have a very complicated relationship. I pushed her on some songs I thought she needed to include on the disc. This is you, even if you don't agree with that. I feel it. The negative side of the Album I didn't discover until I read interviews. I took it personally at first. She did not digg to travel around and promote "Conqueror". The song was the name of what she didn't like about the industry. It was really the music. That's what hurt. If I have to give out music I'm not happy with again, I quit. I'm completely exhausted, really. I'm really empty. I was supposed to be in the studio. I can't stand it. It's nice to paint. OK, Aurora. I've tried it, so I know it goes over your head. Great. Yes. I don't know if it works. How does it feel? I was afraid she was going to quit or be depressed. She almost told me. - "If I can not be me "... - "What's the point? " We differentiate between AURORA and Aurora. Then everyone in the family knows what we're talking about. AURORA in capital letters is the artist. She has heard her whole life that she is mature for age. Smart. Going her own way. It takes a lot not to take it as a mission in life. Especially if you begin to be known before you are 20. When I write music. I'm in the studio to create. It gives it a whole new meaning. I understand everything I need, I understand my position. I understand how insignificant my pain is. And then it's much easier to deal with it. You? I need a piano in the apartment. - I need a piano in the apartment. - A piano? - 20 000 max. - Okay, deal. Was easier before. Without spotlight. Spotlight. I remember that. My life was easier before. Without the spotlight. And my... It's better. And a little more open. Warm and open. I felt that the other way was better. "The queendom come ". Or is it a too long pause? We could put a third voice there. What's weird there? I think there's something about the sound. - They come in the second part. - They can be higher. They were cool. You hear it quite clearly. What it needs. Right? Yesterday I sat thinking about what I really did this year. It just comes as a feeling in the body and in the head. Something I must write about, a melody. So I have to run to the piano or block. It's important that the words come from me. I'm going to pick up everything. How everything should be. I want it to be my own creation. - That's... - I'm not impressed. When should we set up a session? When do we get raw mixes? I love these verses. Bring the verses in when you have a session... ...as much as you want Because the song is not finished. The is problem is that you are missing radio tunes. - "Candles in glass", then? - It is short and terribly produced. The point is that you are looking for songs that will be a showcase. Only one who thinks differently. That's what I need right now. Isn't it about the fact that when you are in a session, you take control of everything? You write songs alone, and then you let others produce a little. Yes, I'm very difficult... It's not going to be written with anyone else. It sounds like an orgasm which it should It's the only goal. - Let's find the sound of an orgasm. - A real one? - No, more like a... Ding! - Electric, yeah yeah yeah. - It's amazing. - Maybe it is... - What's bothering you? I want it to be really interesting. The problem is we should have released something by now. NIDAROS CATHEDRAL, NORWAY - I had a long conversation with Aurora this morning, and this is the situation: She is writing all her tracks anyway. She always bringing in 90% of the song. "Forgotten love " is A potential radio song. Aurora absolutely wants a radio song, I'll be like... on her to do it. I'm going to be with my family and then i'll sit behind the sound engineer. -You want me to come with you? -No, I'm fine. I never dreamed of singing. But I've been dreaming of doing something important. There is a thirst in my body. Don't speak over my voice. I will return from the shadows. And I'll bleed in your bed, turn it red Like the ground outside your window. Love is wild. Love is wild. Love is... ... wild. She had a few weeks to finish three songs. She wanted to do them with Magnus. They delivered. And I personally thought it was very disappointingly bad. We're going to record the album, and I'm not a part of the plan. Aurora has gone even more into her own career. She takes even more decisions entirely on her own. - We need to look at the comments from Decca. (ed:Decca is Aurora's record label) - I haven't had any comments. - I just want to give out music. - It's smart to build a career. But it does not work. About "Gentle earthquake". As a mix, again, I think it is all too mid-low-mid. No, no, no. It's exactly what it should be. It's finished. It should not have less low-low-mid. - So... No, no, no. - What do you say, Magnus? When you see the way they're connected, from that to that to that to that. - It may have that much... - Yes, a little's fine. That's nice. But what they want ... You know what they want. She is all yours. Geir says I have to let go. But I'm not going to let go... ...about some things I hold more firmly than ever. It's very nice here. They have dressed up for you to play with them. - I don't know anything. - But what are we going to do? They will try to play the song, and then we can add something we can use. She's the boss. She's crazy. - You think they're all crazy. - At least here. It's a song. It's a Queedom, not a Kingdom. It's us. Women. Aurora! Aurora! Aurora! Hello! Hello! - Hi! - We can't do any pictures, we can't do any signing. We need to leave. Nice to meet you. Goodbye! {I}I love you.{/I} {I}I love you.{/I} I love you. We were at the airport, and you just gone away. We just wanted to say hi to you. You don't have to be afraid of us. I like this way of living. You get used to things being extreme. I can have existential crises where I freak out over - - that I'm going to be nothing forever one day. When I feel other things, everything else, I get a good sense of security. Because I am doing what I am meant to do. - I can't believe we're in Brazil. - I haven't taken it into my mind. - Do you feel lighter in the soul? - No. - Are you ready for this? - No. What do you need to get ready? - It helps you be here. - You want me to hang around? - A little... It's going to be fine, Aurora. -You're amazing. -Can I hug you please? I don't like to hug. But I like you. You are my absolute favorite singer. I want to give you this... It was half. I'm fine. Thank you for standing here. As George Harrison said, "All things Must pass. " It could be so many things. But I guess that's true. It will be weird to tell you. You need someone who might be a technician for you, because most and foremost you're a producer. I have never seen myself as a drummer. - Am I meeting a hundred people tomorrow also? - I guess... And in Rio? For an audience. Psycho. {I}Aurora! Aurora! {/I} All that I know Lies within emotion. Words remains unspoken, Lead me through the dark. All that I see Comes to me in colours, last for a moment. Lead me through the dark. All that I know. Why don't she go into the bus and then we go into the car? Aurora! One sec! Please, Aurora. Please! Please Aurora. It might be that this was my last concert. I will probably have many different people with me on the journey. - Through my life. But I will always have myself. We have everything we need, but we have to agree on the songs. - There's a mosquito here. - These three songs I can die for. I need a new manager. That Album has a deeper meaning. - You see when you stop stressing. - You got three weeks. It's going to be awesome, and I think we'll make it. - We have to make it. - I know. We're going to make it. It's hard. Nobody's inside my head. It's hard to explain. Wait for them to make it. Or just do it on your own. - Is this all right for you? Is there any anything else you want to hear? - No, I feel at home. -It's a little low non? - Yes I ate my vegetables yesterday. - So I'm taller today. - What happened? Merci. I will kindly watch you sleep. I find out that your eyes are open. I Hide all the pieces that you never would have liked If you knew about them. So I hide my children. -That was great. Beautiful. -It's easy to know when the take is amazing because... You feel it. You want a mouse? The best thing about music is that it can't die. As long as someone keeps it alive by listening to it. People don't know. I haven't released any music in two years. It'il be nice to come back again. Strongly. I mixed it yesterday, until three o'clock at night. I think we have it. Hi. I met Mr. Manager as a very young girl. I didn' get that. To have a what! I need to know this. Now we work together as two adult people. We argue a lot. We disagree about a lot 50% of the time. But I'm very fond of Geir. More than I like to say to him. I'm super excited. More than I have ever been. More than I was the day I was born...for this I decided to name the Album "Infections of a different kind ". It feels like it has an undertone of female empowerment. It's like the voice of the voiceless. There's a sort of manifesto element to Queendom. I can't believe no one had the idea. That's the first thing. I think the fans will go nuts. 'Cause the lyrics are fantastic. -This is your statement. This is your intent. - I feel like being so authentic. Sorry I'm going to be the fangirl. So it's quite inspiring album, at the same time being fun popy and dancy...which I love It's a way to speak to the whole world at once. And make us better. You can make change. When is the physical CD being coming out? That's what we need to know. -I was thinking about September time. - It's very important that we don't wait too long. 'Cause we might get to June, July, August when we think we actually need to do a bit more work here before we release the full Album. We need to assess whether it's the right time to release it in September. -I really don't wanna wait too long. - What's is an Album? Do you know what I mean. -That's when we print the CD. - Yeah ok. -I went to France and I made one album. The songs they stick together, they all have a story. I'm struggling with dividing it up. People don't really listen to Albums anymore. But now that's what it is. It's important that you have the strength in you. That you feel it's an album. I just would love. I really feel that it is 2018, like the way everything is. You've been away a while. And probably you know it's just a fast paced world. Need reminding over the next year and a half that you're back. - I really want that date. - I just want to make it clear that if you release a record in September this year... - that will be doing that record a disservice. I think it's a bigger record and album, I believe that. I don't understand this life. I'm not old enough to have been away for a long time. They want me to have the opportunity to build it up even more. But I love the fans I already have. They're enough for me. And I know they're going to love the Album. Because I do, and they love me. I'm looking forward to it. Hello! Hi! Hello everyone. It's nice to see you again by the way. Thank you. Two minutes. Ten minutes. Everyone gets a hug now. It's hug time. I have so much new music for you, and I'm so excited. Bye! - What are we playing? - Can we start with something old? "Warrior " or something? Often, only change is difficult. It may well be she needs me as a close friend. That she needs it more than help for productions. I'm doing that sacrifice easy. It's important to preserve that friendship. Geir? - I'm glad we can speak Norwegian now. I want us to talk about efficiency today. Half of the people who come, are people working in the industry. That's what Chris said. Can we involve them in this discussion? He can't listen to the songs and how they work live. - Why should they decide anything? - but with "Conqueror "... - I don't want to play it. Do we have to? - When I said that, they became crazy. - It's not that great live. - So what do you got. - What about "Roaming the world" and "Conqueror" -Noooooo but "Infections of a different kind "? Okay. I know how to play it. We know that "Conqueror " is a winner live. And so will "Infections of a different kind be. I've seen you finish up with other songs, and it's been great. I do not want to play "Conqueror ". Not on that stage. There's not enough room to dance anyway. "Infections of a different kind" is magic. Do your thing. Don't worry about me. I'm just early. It's been such a long time. It's so nice to see many of you again. I'm really nervous. We've got many new songs for you tonight. It's nice, it's sweet to play new songs. It's been a long time. He told me I belong in a churchyard. He told me I could walk away, but I wouldn't get far. Tell me how do people know what is hurt, what is love? He told me I belong in a churchyard. Are you ready to work a little? In ten minutes? -It was heavy. - Yes. But you worked your way through it. It's hard. I fought with you. There were only new songs. You were really beautiful. You may well get 20 minutes. Ten. Yes. If you don't want to, Don't give a damn. It's not that important. Hey you, wonderful human being. Honestly, so proud of you. That was so amazing. Congratulations. The greatest thing In the beginning it was important to distinguish - - Between Aurora with upper and lower case. But then it has grown more and more together. Infections Of A Different Kind was released on 28. September with glorious reception We are sold out in the United States. Where's Aurora? Hello. Sold OUT. It's strange to have met someone like that. We met in a special way. I meet people in a strange way. In painful times I have said that I have met people so that I dislike people. It is especially that one gets to jump right into the heart and swim around there. For one minute maybe. And then suddenly you're gone again. That's my most important job. That everyone feels they are being seen. When you were little, you thought it was scary to sing in front of others. I sing a little too. Do you have any tips? It's good that you're nervous. That means it's something you care about. When I was a kid, I didn't like to go to school. It was very stressful with all the peoples and sounds there. But eventually I began to like adversity. I felt like I was like I was for a reason. A little outside. If I am The world, why would I hurt? Oh, that is living. This is the breath.
