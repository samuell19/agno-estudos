Where is the toilet, please? - Does it disturb you, if I smoke? - No, not at all These small Russian things.. .. That... that was delicious You have hardly eaten anything - I never eat much. - You are not that fat But you are gracious.

He... he is a cook. - He must cook you nice meals. - He is too tired for that. He makes me eat frozen foods - I'm sorry, it's not the castle of Anet. - It was superb. Next time, you will come to my place I... I will ask Franck. .. to make... a cake with potatoes. - Good... Good night. - As a matter of fact, I don't work at the museum but outside. In... in... in fact, I sell postcards. - And... me, I am a cleaning lady. - What's that? - It's nothing, it's a mate Continue - Oh... oh not! - Remove that - No leave it, I'm cold! - Not that! - Has someone lost their tongue? - That really annoys me. - That... is not true! - Oh!

Why do you ask that? - That's what people say when they see each other It's good here. - It's dreadful, yes. I can't invite you to the Money Tower and for that what you eat.. .. it would be waste - Stop that immediately, or I go away. - Cleaning lady... You'll always astonish me - Wait, mum - You drink too much. - I am thirsty. - Why you never come to see me? - And then, I do what? - Always the last word, like your father. You don't like me to talk about him. - Let's not go there - I go where I want. You're not finishing your bowl? - No. - Look at yourself, people would call you a skeleton You think that boys will want you like that? - Mum... - do you like that? - No, but I know...

To find a place and... - I want to help you If it's you who advertises it for your grandmother You made her believe too much that she would go on her own - But we must trick her somehow A beautiful room facing park or... - It is very expensive, that, you know. - Oh really, how much? - Oh, at least 2000 Euros. - What? That's not possible, it is what I make in one month. - Or she will have to sell her house. - But she would never do that And she's got her pets there as well... Good, thank you. I remember you. - More hot water? - Excuse me, I have emptied the balloon. - It is not serious. I was afraid that the water-heater is still broken Euh... on the other hand, don?t say "Excuse me".. .. mais "excuse me" You can't excuse yourself all alone. Linguistically, it's not correct. - Excuse me - There you go You go out tonight? - No, I can't handle it I have one day per week, I will have to spend it.. .. watching my grandmother cry - Camille... Camille, it's... me, Phil... Philibert. My God, what have... have you done to your hair? You're not OK? You are very pale. - I must go. - The weather is very cold. Don't go out with bare head.

Waiting anything in return. - What are you thinking? - Nothing. I will tell you. Because I don't have anything to give. - a wedge of lemon? - No, thanks. - Philibert... - Yes? - I have told you how many times? Butter, that's put in a butter container! And the salad, that's not left in the plastic. Or else, it is damaged, I told you! You don't care about anything, as for the lemon. It is damaged like that. Don't let him impress you. You are beyond all that. - I hate December. These festivals, they depress me. - That's the fourth time you tell me that. - It doesn't depress you does it? - You go down to Lyon, for Christmas? - Yes, with your uncle... You don't accompany me, this year? - No, I work. - You sweep the needles of the fir tree? - Exactly.

My girlfriends are nice. - Nice... that depresses me. - I must go. Waiter! - Leave it, that?s for me. - OK, I invite you. - Is it my Christmas present? - We must talk. - Let's talk then. What do you want to say to me? - Lodge whoever you want in your place, but that's a shame. To my mind, you are crazy about her, but that will pass. - And... what would that change? - You don't know the chicks. As soon as you're crazy about a woman somewhere, it becomes a brothel. - it isn't for sale anymore.. .. "citizen republican. She died under our sword, free. Following your orders.. .. I have crushed the children under... the..." But... but... Are you drawing or... are you listening to me? - I draw while I listen to you. - This monster who has served... .. his beautiful fatherland with so much of enthusiasm, he will be captured. .. with Danton and decapitated. - With what you know, why you didn't become a historian or a professor? - I have... I tried. I took part three times in the contest of the School of the librarians, without success. Day before, I... I can't sleep.. .. And... I've lost.. .. my hair... I have even lost my teeth. - You ever went to see a psychiatrist? - No, but I have... I have met a girl. She wants to become an actress, she wants me to go .. to her theatre course. She believes theatre would do good for me. - Then, how is it going? - I have sick kids.. .. husband who spends his pay at the races, my sister-in-law who irritates me.. .. a neighbour who shits in the elevator and the telephone is cut off. Other than that all OK. - Why did he do that, your neighbour? - I know nothing about it. But the next time, I'll make him clean out his shit. Are you going up to the fifth? - Yes. And why do you always make the 5th? I will speak to the boss. - My... My name is Philibert. - Go ahead. - I came because it is Sandrine who... .. told me to come, and I... I... .. I would love to make theatre, but I have a problem with elocution. because of anxiety Often, I am too distressed... - I will send you .. to an speech therapist. - That's not funny. With this speech therapist, you will work with music. It is music therapy. After .. some lessons, you won't stutter any more. - Agreed. - And then think of Louis Jouvet, He also was a stammerer. - OK. I would... I would love to do theatre. - You will, don't you worry. - Good evening. - Dance. - Turn down the music. We are going to have problems with the neighbours. - You are right, she is a bitch! - You drive me nuts Go to your room! Go ahead, lock yourself in! Die! - Oh! Music! - I turned it down! - She really drives me crazy Open! Bitch, open this door! You will leave here! And fast! You really drive me nuts, bitch! - Then? Be proud of yourself, my boy, don't you? Answer me! Are you proud of yourself? Are you looking at scenery? You're making faces... It's full. You make faces whereas I will suffer here like a dog. - I'm not making faces, that's unfair. I work all this week. .. except on Monday, and I will come to see you on Monday. Is it my fault if I'm far, if I am all alone? is it my fault if you are widowed? If you had had my mother as child? I've chosen this rotten profession I start with at 8 o'clock and I finish at midnight. I have siesta to bear it. That's my life. That's nothing... I am nothing! If you keep annoying me, I won't come see you anymore. Stop crying. Go to your bed, I take the armchair. - Yes, my son. Forgive me. You will bring the armchair closer, don't you? - Yes. - There you go. - We must talk. Sit down, please. - Have you taken my notebook? - No, it was there, on the dresser. - Have you seen the keys for the small staircase? - In my pocket. - Give them to me. - No. I don't want you to leave. It's me who decides that. If you are not here anymore, Philibert will become like he was before. I don't want to do that to him. He helped me when I was in the shit. I don't want to hurt him. Sit down. - Can I? - Thank you for the stereo. I am sorry about yesterday evening, I was stuffed. I made myself complete idiot. I am tired. - I am tired, too! For other reasons, I can't put up with your aggression anymore Shut up when people talk to you And then in any case... I am not able of living in commune. - We'll stay all together, and I will lock myself in. Your bed is remade. - C'mon, give me the keys. - Which keys? - Don't be afraid to make faces. Don't be afraid to open your mouth wide open. And then, have a little drink. It relaxes your larynx and pharynx. You will relax your vocal cords.

And give bread to those who don't have any. Amen. - Enter. - Merry Christmas. - Thank you, you too. How are you? - Yes, a bit sad, but I'm OK. And you? - OK. - I brought you a small gift. My grandmother knitted it. - It is pretty... Thank you. - Can I kiss you? - Of course. - Oh, forgive me. You're having a drink all alone? Can I? You don't have to wear it. - But I love your grandma's scarf! You will thank her for it, don't you? I will make her a small gift. Can you sit down there? - You want to draw me? - Yes. Can you take off your sweater and your t-shirt? - You want me to be bare? - Yes please, that would be good. - Like this? - Yes. - Why are you always alone? - What do you mean? - You don't like men? - Yes, I like them a lot. Girls also, but I prefer boys. - Excuse me. Hello? Yes, boss. Yes... I don't know. You have to ask Jean-Luc. I'm trying to charm intelligent girl and it's not easy. That takes longer. Yes... I'm working on it. To get to bed with the girl? Yes, I believe that you are right. OK, goodbye. What do you do on New Year's Day? - Nothing special. Why? - I have possibly a job for you. My boss looks for an extra. - Careful, they must stay whole. Small veins must be visible. - Lobster is ready! HAPPY NEW YEAR! - Hello? Ah, Philibert! Happy New Year! Thank you, to you too.

I must have been 10 years old when they separated. I never saw my mother happy, I never saw her smiling. My father, on the other hand... - My... my... name is... Philibert Jehan... My name is Philibert Jehan Louis Marquet of Durbelli?re. Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! I will turn up! Put on your wigs sweet-heart. My name is Philibert Jehan.. ..

You're not going to blow up on me? - Very funny... - You're not going to get away with it like that. - You do what? - OK, let's see... - No, wait, not like that. - Stop that, you shouldn't envy me like that. - Wait... wait - What? You want more? - No, but... - Calm down. - I don't want things go like this between us. - You want it to happen on a romantic boat? Stop that. And music too. - It that all? - You tell me... - What? - Everything. I want to know everything about you, tonight. - If I start, it's you .. who will feel obliged to hug me. Later... - Later?

Do you have contraception, at least? - Wait. - You want me to continue? I am still hungry, Mister Cook. - Still? Miss is very greedy. - Very. - But that is over there, we don't serve you anymore, Madam. they have a break. - Oh well, what a pity. - Wait, we can perhaps make an exception. I made a soup. - Hm! - Taste this and tell me what you think. Here we go. - What is it, small noodles? - Pearls of Japan. - Pearls of Japan... That's pretty. - Here we go. - Here. - To the future. - To the present. Hm... we are not falling in love, are we? We kiss, we toast...

That's super. - What are you doing here? - Well, I waited for you. - That was super fast. The notary called Philou last week. I didn't tell you about it as I was completely dumbfounded. Thank you for what you did for her. - She has gone as she wished... to her house. Now, where are you going live? - I leave for England. My boss found me a good place. I will be able to improve my English. - When are you going to leave? - Tomorrow. - You didn't get fed up slaving away for others? - I have always been fed up with that, but I have no choice. - And the Restaurant of the Travellers? He said that he agreed to give you credit. - I will see when I get back. - It may sell, from now on. - Why don't you say: "I don't want you to leave"? It is so hard to say as a phrase? - I am... I am afraid. I am afraid of you, I am afraid of me... I am afraid of all. I was afraid to miss you. - Five minutes later, you would have missed me. - Franck, I don't want you to leave. - Too late, I will leave in 20 minutes. - No, I don't want you to leave - I have already left in my head. - Yes? - It's me. I am with the customs, I wanted to speak two seconds with you... I wanted to tell you that it made me sad to leave you, too. And I imagined you lost in the station.. .. Crying, I felt sad. - I won't cry at all, I am just about to leave. - Really? Liar. How are you? Is all well? Hello. We don't serve anymore, you are coming late. We will find a solution. Philou! Find a table for this couple. "Service this... service that... "And the reception... "decor, drawings of Fauque"... - He doesn't even speak about my cooking. - "A heart beat of this bistro. The young chef..." - Do you have what I wanted? - Yes, please note, it's not "pepper bird" - OK, thank you. I will show you the kitchen shortly. - Ah, but I recognize that. - And then? - I want the same. - You want the same? - Well then... But... - Philou? You take care of the kitchen, I will have take care of the Missus.
