Ga-young "Don't answer" Yes I'm here. Did you just wake up? Jeong-hoon - Who is it? - It's me. God, you must be kidding. It's freezing. Your parents are out, right? You should have asked before you rang the doorbell. You didn't answer my call. They're not here, right? You can't come in. Don't be ridiculous. Chapter 1 Anyway Hey, it's cold as hell out there. - Any beer? - You are drunk. Hell, in the daytime? Tell me. You went to the audition. I can tell just by your face. If you screwed it up, you should be thinking upon it or looking for another chance, instead of drinking. Auditions are your excuses for drinking, huh? I got my wisdom tooth pulled, so I've been holding off for a whole week. Just one, and leave. Look, why is this so small? A baby's beer? You should have one, too. Why are you rejecting me? You've opened the door for me. You must've seen me through this. That's broken. I called, so you knew it was me. So what's the point you're trying to make? I said why are you rejecting me? I haven't seen you for a while. And we can have a better time. Does your girlfriend bother you? Just tell her one of your friends came by. Wait, you don't have to say anything. I'll leave soon anyway. - Alright, you can stay. - Really? But don't think of anything weird. Weird? - Dirty thoughts. - What dirty thoughts? You always have one. No, don't. This is boring. Are you insensible? It's funny. Joker got arrested, Harvy became a villain but died, then the Batman took responsibility for everything and ran away. I've seen it twice. - Are you sure? - Yup. Hey, come rest your... rest your head here. What is wrong with you? Stay still. Rest your head here. Stay still for a moment. Aren't you gonna ask why I'm here? You don't think of it when you come here. I do, sometimes. What brought you here? What the fuck was that? You thought they were my lips. That was a shitty joke. Go home. Hey. - Why don't we sleep together? - What? Let's do it. What are you looking for? Hey Jeong-hoon. It's me Ga-young. Remember? We've talked at Min-ji's birthday party. I've known you since high school. I saw your underwear by accident when you were changing in the classroom. Remember that? Yeah, that was me. Anyway it was nice meeting you and I want us to be closer. This is my number. 010 6735 3254 I'd like to HAVE you. That's weird. Really. You've always been weird. Is this the right style for asking someone out? You called me anyway. You haven't changed at all, now and then. Neither did you. - Right, I wrote something here. - What? - Got it. - What are you doing? November 30th, 2011. Ga-young dropped by. - You wrote it? - Yes, come down and take a look. That's stupid. Come out. I wrote it at the first visit. Did you notice? Who said you can write something there? Just get out. I'll write more. "Just banged." Give me a pen. Why would I bang you? Aren't you going to? Are you kidding? Okay, I'll just write "Dropped by" then. Give me a pen. - Come out now. - No. My parents are coming. You should go. When? What time are they coming back? Around eight. What? That's like decades away. I'm tired. I should lie down. Hello? Is this Ga-young's number? Hi. How did you know it was me? I've been waiting for your call. Ah. Um. Thank you for the card. So? Um... Just... Well... I... What do you say we go watch Hong Sang-soo's film? What? Do you know Hong Sang-soo? Well... Think I've heard of him. Is he the one who directed "The Host"? No, that's Bong Joon-ho. Ah, sorry. I don't really watch movies. This one will be released soon, and it has already won a big prize abroad. You know Moon So-ri, the actress? Yeah. It has Moon So-ri and Yi Sun-sin in it. I see. But... It's fine if you don't want to. That movie is better watching alone. Oh... Right. I'll see you again, with the other guys. Okay. Wait, the movie ends around ten so how about a beer then? Shit! You. It's not right. Then why did you lie beside me at first? Did I drag you down? Can't you leave it beautiful as it is? That's why you are pathetic. Well, you are. You rape your boyfriend like this everyday, right? I don't have a boyfriend. I mean when you had one. Have you already broken up? Why would I come here if I'm still going out with him? Well, I have a girlfriend, so get out. I didn't force you to get in, you crawled into the bed. I mean, did you have to touch it? Ha, talking like he's got a big dick. - What? - Do you? You've never seen mine. I can draw it with my eyes closed. - Get out. - Why did you do that? My parents are coming. Get out. You're lying. I said get out. You drink whenever you want to, come to my place and lie with me whenever you want to. Has it ever occurred to you that it might be annoying to others? Why are you so serious all of a sudden? You easily come and say "Let's get laid!" when you're single. You don't give a shit to me and my girlfriend. Mine's over because of you. Bullshit, I can see that he ran away. It's you. You made me miserable. Are you sure it's me? Of course. Everything's my fault, always. Seems like you're having a good time with your girlfriend. Like? Do you often go to the astrology caf√©? How did you know that? I saw it on your girlfriend's facebook page. You're not supposed to go there. It's called freedom, according to the law. Hey, stop faking it, it's not your stuff. You, astrology? You got distrubed, right? Shut up. Hey, don't be too nice to her. Not your business. She'll get hurt from your kindness someday. That doesn't make sense, I'm doing my best. Okay, okay. Did you write something there? You think I'm that crazy? Like, I was your ex? Never mind. Like, you come quick on blowjob? You think that's funny? Coming too quickly is not funny for sure. Does she like to do it with you? Of course. I suppose you're doing your best? I did my best with you, too. No, you didn't. How is that? My boyfriends, they were never eager to have me. It's because you move before they do. What am I supposed to do? Just wait? Just... let them begin first. How? Well... Is that what your girlfriend do? Yeah. Most of the girls do so. What? You weren't like that to me! Every girl's first time is precious. - So what? - So? You never bothered to touch my boobs or kiss me. What's wrong with that? I had to fuck you first. It's not my fault that you started it. I thought that was common. Just wait. You're too eager. I can't help it. Say there's a guy, he's not going anywhere. But you go for him right away and can't hold back when all you have to do is wait. My body wants to get tangled as soon as possible. Now you're being an animal. Is this why your boyfriend ran away? Alright, he ran away. You're not helping at all. Your temper. This is not me when my boyfriend's around. You're the exception. So, you're being yourself after it's all over? Is that it? What's your point? Aren't you gonna sleep with me? I'm not that crazy. Come on, give your mama a taste. Are you in a gang now? Why am I here then? You barged in. Also, stop calling me when you're drunk at night. I was up all night before the exam, because of your call. Every failure needs someone to blame for. I didn't say I failed. I did great. That's because I called you. Whatever. Anyway, don't you dare drunk call me again. I'm sorry... But I suggest you change your number. So where's my place among your exes? What do you mean? Your drunk dials. How many do you call before you call me? It's only you. Don't lie to me. I'm not. Last time we talked, you said five of 'em... Right, those are the guys I just know. I miss 'em like I miss my friends... It's nothing like I'm gonna score. Look, You'll be a much better partner if you stop making drunk calls. You look fine, you're cute, and smart. Really, you are adorable... if you have fewer drinks, booty calls and easy loves. I know you used to be popular in schools. Of course I was... if I haven't met a celibate and discovered my sex drive. I could have become everyone's crush. Is that your best word choices? Sex drive? And I doubt that everyone's crush. You are a libertine, right? You bastard! What? Are you not? I don't know. Where's my milk? Tell me. Why were you like that? What? Why were you unwilling to have me? Maybe I didn't want to. You heartless. My friends came to me saying... their boys only want to kiss and sleep together... and can you imagine how lonely that made me? You've had me your way anyhow. That didn't feel like a right way. Ga-young, seems like you're traumatized by our relationship, but... don't you ever doubt your sex appeal. You still give me a boner. Enjoy your noodles. Why did you quit your job? I didn't fit in. You've already left two colleges. Can you imagine what my biggest regret is? That I finished high school. Why? Well... it was stupid. Grab me a beer too, since you're standing up. The beer completes the noodles. Get your own beer. This is mine to begin with. So, are you looking for another job? I'm not planning to have one. How will you make your ends meet? I'll live on beers and noodles. Do you think you can buy them with nothing? I've got plenty of ex-boyfriends to plead for a meal. What would your mom say? She nags me constantly. Like, I'll get a daughter just like me someday. What do you say to that? I won't have a daughter. "Bean" "Ink" That's not ordinary. "Poo" You said "poo" already. Huh? Did you write "poo" twice? Oh, why did I do that? You lost. No, I say "again." That's not even a noun. You lost. Can't you let it go, you idiot? Chapter 2 Have you heard of it? I got my wisdom tooth pulled. When? Last Monday. I thought you got it pulled already. That was my left tooth. It's two on my right jaw this time. Now I've got none. Like my love's all drained away. I still got all of 'em in me. Do you know why they won't come out? I have one, around here. - I mean, why it doesn't hurt? - No. Because you never had love. I've had mine. But it was awful. I made a fuss while getting numbed. The dentist and the nurse, they looked pretty mad because I was moving around bothering other patients. I asked them for a chance to call my friend just like it was in the quiz show "Millionaire". They said yes, so I called Seo-ra. You must've been a pain their ass. Did Seo-ra come? Yep. But she wanted to wash her hair first so I told her everyone's waiting for you. She made it right after I got two numb shots here. She was supposed to hold my hand but she just stood in the corner because it was too cramped there. She said "Good luck." Oh, Seo-ra. So that was the last one? Right. Afterwards, Seo-ra told me to take the tooth that was on a piece of cloth but the nurse heard it and covered it away. Why would you want to take that? It used to be a part of me and also a strong evidence of my love. Come to think of it, I should have gone to a bigger dentistry. It was a rather small one... maybe that's why it feels so empty even after a week. It bothers me. Just like tiny, unresolved emotions... left out when love is over. I don't think so. That's because you've been drinking... right after you've pulled it... It's been a week. Only a week, and you pour it down. I'm careful enough. I take a sip and wait before I swallow it. Anyway, I'm frightened to have a tooth pulled away. Maybe they'll find out easier ways in the future. Say, there's someone with a hammer when I get in, and he knocks me out... and pulls it while I'm unconscious. I can wake up a month later. Is everyone dumb or something? But then, you'll resist even before you get to the door. You're damn right. You're the only one without a job, right? Nope. Most of my friends are like me, they are pleasure seekers. Oh, E-wook just got a job. How about Se-yeon? Se-yeon? She's a senior in college. Then she'll get a job soon. Why are you asking? What? You always ask about her when you're with me. She's your friend, that's why. Pretty girls will screw up your life. What are you talking about? You know, something weird happened to Se-yeon lately. What is it? She had this party with the guys she studied together, and she slept with one of them by accident. That was three months ago, I guess. She liked it but they lost touch since then. Then about a month ago... he suddenly told her to go to the hospital. - Hospital? - Yes. She got him talking about the details. He said he was itchy down there and went to the clinic, then was asked about the latest sex... for the possibility of transmission. For him, Se-yeon was the latest contact. That's hhow she got the message after a long time. Not even a call. Se-yeon has syphilis? I don't know. But according to him, he has been celibate for a year, except this one time with Se-yeon. So he called to prove his innocence. Anyway, Se-yeon booked an appointment, scared. You know what's funny? She was scared because of the other guy, whom she slept with, a while after the night happened. This guy has been her crush for a long time. So if the virus is real, her crush's involved, too. The whole idea shook her up. But wait, there's another guy, more like friends with benefits - Wait, what? - Just listen. It's all in your imagination, isn't it? Of course not. Se-yeon called this friend to ask... if there's anything wrong with him. There's not, and also her test result turned out to be clean. - How did it happen then? - Who knows? What is it called, the disease? I forgot the name, but she told me something. it's not serious, but still one of infectious STDs. Back to the story, she's relieved with the result. and with her crush unharmed. Thinking about it, contaminating your crush... with STDs on one night stand. Later, she missed that one hundred dollar she spent on the test. That's weird. One can get infected by himself? If his celibacy statement was true... how could Se-yeon be clean when he's not? Who knows? Maybe he got it by touching himself. There's another thing. She said it should've been a great night... considering what's happened after, but it was pathetic... because he was too drunk to do it properly. That's a shame. I knew he would be a disappointment... when I saw his pictures. - Story of your life, eh? - What? Anyway, he made all the fuss with this germ... and annoyed innocent ones. She doesn't look like one of those people, you know. How many guys is she sleeping with? But they are nice, every one of them. It's nothing to be proud of. Se-yeon and I have high standards for lovers. As I said, it's nothing to be proud of. It is. I'd sleep with ten decent guys, not with one dull boy. How about only one decent guy? I wouldn't be able to tell the difference then. I need all then samples to appreciate their value. I suppose you don't have an STD? Why would I have one? You? - I got tested for AIDS. - AIDS? But I got a negative result, obviously. It was when I pulled the other wisdom tooth. The clinic I went to was a big one, and they made me sign this paper. It was about me taking responsibility when things go wrong. Anyway, that dental intern with the paper was handsome. This doctor told me that there are a few tests needed... since there will be blood, no matter how much, and the AIDS test was one of them. I would have said no, if the doctor was female... because the test cost me sixty dollars. But again, he was handsome, and who knows? He could fall in love with me. That's how fate works. This idea stopped me from saying, "I don't have the virus and I can't afford it, forget about blood, just pull it." So I said okay, and he took out a machine from his desk, then pushed a thick swab in my mouth. He got it back into the machine, and told me to wait three minutes. I went out to the lobby and sat there, waiting for the result, watching patients and doctors go by. You know what happened inside me? I never had to worry about AIDS through my life, even though I've had fun with a few strangers, and even then they were all nice. But now my fate is up to this little machine, whether I am an AIDS patient or not. This idea scared the hell out of me. Can you imagine? I stared at the people walking by, thinking how it would feel like to have AIDS. These were crazy thoughts in my head. It's not funny. That three minute felt like thirty years. Finally the doctor showed up and said, "It's negative." What a relief. I repented my lustful nights, thanked for a newly given life, never realizing that I came for a wisdom tooth. That must've been unforgettable. But come to think of it, I feel deceived. After a few days, I gave it a thought, and realized there are more patients like me that the doctor took care of. They must've have thought the same thing. Staring at other people, feeling lonely and anxious. And I thought, this patient, no, this doctor must've enjoyed watching me terrified, counting every second. Seriously. I acted like I was pure. An innocent girl, frightened in front of the AIDS test machine... It made him smile for sure. That's just your imagination. It can't be. I was upset and ashamed. And he didn't show up at the removal. It was a chubby, old doctor instead of him. Handsome guys will screw up my life. I will refuse those tests, if I were to go to the dentist. You should. They're worthless. Tell them you're a virgin. By the way, I've got someone on my radar. Who? Someone. But he never calls me first. Well, who is it? There's this guy, nothing special. I've got a feeling that he'd look old, no, just old. Seven years older than me. What's special about this pal? This pal does better than you. Done it already? It's just a saying. So who is he? You don't know him. He's handsome. You always go for handsome guys. I wasn't aware of it. Technically, I like popular guys, and they tend to be handsome. Why did you go out with me then? I'm not popular. You were my experiment. Bullshit. Yes, you were popular. So-hee did like you. I wasn't aware that So-hee was speaking ill of me. Rumors were for everyone else but me. You two became friends later. Yes, I solved her math problems. What's she up to these days? I have no idea. Anyway, he doesn't call me. He wasn't like this when he got my number. You call him first then. Believe me, I'm an expert, and boys always call first when they're interested. Right. See? Well, not always. It is. Boys... they're just like kids staring at the cake. Where did you get this? From a book I read. Oh, and he has a girlfriend. Is this about me? What? My bad. But seriously, who is he? You heard me. A handsome guy. He's handsome... Let's call him first. No. - Why not? - I said no. What's his name? No. Give it back to me. You gotta try to see if he's sour grapes. He's not. I'm gonna have him. Why not? You're good at being the first one. Show me what you've got. Not any more... Maybe I'm getting old. And it's not right. He has a girlfriend. I have a girlfriend too. And I wanted to keep myself under control, so I deleted his number. That's just silly. I know. I'll never change when I get old, this grandma would do it again with another old guy. Crap. That leads me to... sleeping together? - With whom? - You. Are you insane? You said you like him. Why me? I didn't have a chance for a long time... and that makes me doubt my charm. What? You'd end up in jail... if you were born under a coup regime. Fuck me or get lost. You get lost. This is my place. How about a kiss? I'd love to kiss. The last kiss takes me back longer than sex does. A kiss stands for real love. Kiss is real love. Young lady, you've come to the wrong place for a kiss or a sex. Says your precious dick. Hey. Your language. Did you just hit me? "Soap scent" Hello? Hello? Darling? Are you there? - Someone called you. - Who? What did you say to her? Tell me. Did you say something creepy? Like what? What did you say when you answered? - I said you're taking it hard. - What? I mean your meat's got hard. Hello? Darling, I couldn't hear anything. Okay... Are you doing something, darling? Well... I'm watching "The Dark Night". I saw it was on a cable called "Super Action". Yes, that one. It ended hours ago. I mean I fell asleep with it on. I see. Are you alone at home? What? Yes. I'm all alone. - Can I come? - Now? Hey honey, have you seen "The Priests", the film? What do you say we go watch it? I'm dying to go. Sounds great. That's coming right after our time at your place. My place? It's all messed up. Last time it wasn't. Now there's something nasty here. You know, we haven't done it for a long time. All right. I'll clean it up by five... Okay. So come here around five. - Okay. -Okay. See you then. What's wrong with her? Why horny suddenly? What did you say to her when you answered? I said nothing. She's got intuitions. You should go. So that you could nail her? Come on. And "Soap scent"? Do you smell it there? Please, I said go. Ga-young, I'm begging you to leave. I mean it. Leave. Please. Have fun. She has a serious issue on her temper. Seriously. What now? What? Open the door. I said go. I said open the door. Jesus... What now? I told you to leave. This doesn't feel right. This cannot be right. I can't just go home like this. - I'm not your mistress. - Get up, or I'll make you regret it. - Tell her not to come. - Seriously, what's wrong with you? What have I done wrong? You've gone too far. You drunk called me, and I take it. You got dumped, and I blame the stranger. You barge in, and I spend my time with you. Have I slept with you behind my girlfriend? What else can you blame me for? You are not thinking about coming back to me obviously. Bitch. Yeah, I didn't see it coming. No, I'm all right. Sure, I'll look for the pill, or go see a doctor. I'm sorry. Okay, Wednesday then. I miss you, too. Okay. I'll call you later. Bye. - Turn it off. - Huh? Stop playing the game and come lie with me. - Why? - Just do it. All right. Guess what. What? I "Like"-d it. You know, when we were together, I'm sorry that I hurt you. I'm still sad whenever I think about it... for all the things you've been through. You're lying. I'm not. I feel pain here. Those good memories, you just won't let them go, will you? I wanted to apologize to you. Right. In your own way. You make mistakes having sex, and make it up with another sex. Do you feel better, now that I'm part of it? That's not what I meant. Eun-jin When did you come? You should have let me know. You know, she's here to talk. I'm going out for cigarettes. Hey, it's been a while. You are drinking coke? I thought you liked pine needle juice. I suppose you moved on and found coke? Yes. What happened? You liked it so much... that you always carried one in your bag and gave it to me. Nothing happened. Hey, I came here only to consult with Jeong-hoon. We were that close, you know, and there are things that I am worried about. About what? I just quit my job... and am going for the auditions instead. That's one thing, - and... - Okay. Make yourself at home. You're going out again? Shall we go out for a dinner? I have a plan. Do you? My brother's girlfriend, she came here too. She was nice to me. So, you've met her. She's younger than me... and still very kind. I'm kind, too. Hey, would you tingle my hand? Twelve. I can really feel it. You're lying. Eun-jin, I'm here to get back with your brother. That means... you sleep with him? What about his girlfriend? It's up to him now. I still like this juice, too. Chapter 3 Therefore You still here? Guess what I'm doing. What? Sleeping around. Stop it. My feet are cold. - Hey. - What? I'm wet again. You're wet what, three times a day? Fuck you, jerk. - Why are you swearing? - You insulted me first. You said stupid things. You jerk, you call it wet when you're horny, and slippery when you're not. Who said slippery. Okay, okay. Don't you even think about it. Don't. - Promise me. - I do, I do. - Give me your hand. - Why? Okay. Wait, my hand hurts here. - Bullshit! - What? I said okay. How's Eun-jin? She's just the same. Hey, how about we get back together? What? Let's get back together. I'll do my best. You're kidding. Come back to me. It's different this time. I won't bother you with you and your girlfriend's past. I'll change from now on, and I want you to be the turning point. I've known you for a long time, but you're too light-hearted. So? In a good way. Then come to me. I'll behave. Well, but I won't be able to handle your flirting. So the fault's on me, right? No one else's? - Huh- I mean, you'd prefer me over your girlfriend? You wish. Then why did you sleep with me? - What's wrong with that? - You piece of shit. You said you wanted to. I did, but you should have restrained yourself. I have an excuse called drunkenness, but you didn't drink, and you even... called your girlfriend not to come here. Why did you do that? Why did you sleep with me? Because I wanted it, too! You were right, we did it all the time. That made me want it again. Satisfied? I couldn't hold it off. That's good. I liked it too. So let's begin where we left off. What about that guy you had a crush on? I won't call him from now on. No. I don't trust you anymore. Hey, I don't trust you either. I've seen you cheating without guilt. How would I know it won't happen again? Then what's the point of getting back together? None. No, it came out wrong. I think it can be better this time. Name one reason why we should go out. - Huh? - No, five. Are you serious? Number one, you're handsome. Two, you last long enough in bed, and Three, not too long. Four, your thing does erect. And number five, it's not small, according to my database. Now I realized how magnificent you are. Were you born like that? Are you done? No, I mean it. There are some guys... who disappointed me. Write a book about it. In my preschool years, I secretly loved this girl. - Who? Me? - She was my first love, I guess... and she was pretty. But one day, she had a car accident and died on her way to school. And you know, I was a child, and I thought I'd never love anyone else. So, don't feel bad about yourself. I admire you. But that's not going to stop me. Guys. They always find their way out. Do you think I'm dumb? You didn't go to preschool. What? You bastard, are you a moron? You told me yourself. Did I? Besides, that trauma's too beautiful for you. What's wrong with me having one? Stop it, for real. I can have one. Cut it out. Wait, this is a deja vu. - What? - You wiping your face. I think I've seen it. Is this a dream? You'll need your spinning top then. A top's not a totem for me. I ask questions instead. - Questions? - Yes. Have you been to Professor Hwang's daughter's wedding? - Who's Professor Hwang? - See? This isn't a dream. Prof. Hwang is the chief of my major, but you don't know him. His daughter just got married. If you answered my question "Have you been to her wedding?" like "Yes, I have, I've met other guys too," then it's a dream. I mean, if this is a dream, you're not you, but a work of my subconscious. And because I know Prof. Hwang, your copy would know him. - Isn't it brilliant? - Yeah. So in my dream, I ask a question that you could never answer. If you answer it, then that's a spinning top for me. I should keep myself away from you. It's a bit creepy, isn't it? So, you'd know if it's a dream. How do you get out? - I fall. - Fall? Yes. It wakes me up. You know, I never tried falling in real life, including bungee jumps but I can still feel the dizziness as if I'm actually jumping off. That wakes me up. But... I forgot the name... Right. What if you die like they did in the movie "Inception"? I never had problem telling dream from reality. There's one certain way to do it. If you're not sure, it's a dream. This always works. But I fell again in my dream the other day, and I was about to feel it, only to find it gone, then the concrete floor absorbed me like a sponge, then it spit me out, just like in the movies. It didn't wake me up. I have no memory of actual falling, I guess that's why I wake up. But as I grew comfortable with dizziness, it's getting harder to come out. How would you wake up then? I have an alarm clock. What? But I still like dreams, it's fun. I hope it gets faster and, you know, more confusing. That'd be fun. Has it ever had me in? Sometimes. We do it when you're on. Also if I don't want to wake up, I just have sex. Well... with whom? Whoever there. What if it's her? I do it with girls in my dreams. I even did it with a baby. - But they all have penises. - That's gross. I liked it. You must've been longing for it. - Maybe. - You don't have dreams at night? - No. - It's because you're an idiot. - Are you going to keep saying that? But you're cute when you sleep. You get kissed and you smile. - How do you know that? - I've done it before. And I kissed you more out of curiosity, but your smile stopped after the third one. See? You laugh like an idiot. What. - Okay. - Wait, I need this. Okay. Tell me about yourself. Sure, my name's Jeong Ga-young, and I'm applying for Shin-sung Corporation. My candidate ID is 0988987. I, I am well trained with manners, and I am a first-mover by nature. You dropped out of college twice. What was the problem? - With college? - No, with you. Well... why are you on familiar terms with me? Is it wrong to be? You look way younger than me anyway. Well... There was no specific problem. It was hard to get up early to go college... and one thing led to another. So that's the problem. Specific. Then you'd quit this company sooner or later, right? Do... do I have to come early? How would you work at night in a construction company? Are you living in "The Truman Show"? But... why do you keep using informal speech with me? I believe I have every right to do so. I am older than you. My aunt was born in 1942, and I'll call her now. If she treats you the same, you'd have nothing to say. Now I see, you are a sadist. Enjoy hurting people. We were talking about the tone of speech. Where did this sadist come from? This industry's gone wrong because of you sadists. I believe we were... we were talking about the tone. Again, where did this sadist come from? Do you even know what a sadist is? Do you like S&M play? What? Isn't this an obvious sexual harassment? How did informal speech come to this? It's so hard, working for this company. You're not part of it yet. Wake up, you're in an interview. I can see how hard it would be. Okay, two minutes and thirty six seconds. - Well done. - Thanks. What are the jobs you've had? I was a part-timer in a convenience store, a waiter in a buffet, and a student worker in a library. I think I've been through quite a lot. You haven't submitted your English proficiency test score. Oh, I've took it, but it has passed two years of validation period. What was your score then? Sorry. That's okay, we don't use English very often. Do you have a girlfriend? Yes, I do. - Next? - Come on. - Well... next? - Don't do that. Kids nowadays, do they play S&M with their partners? Not very often, but... on a special occasion, or anniversaries. - What's your role in it? - I'm usually the sadistic one. It's more appropriate for beginners like me, according to my girlfriend, who's more experienced. Plsus it's safer. - She's productive. - You're flattering. What's the first thing you'd like to do if you're accepted? I'd like to hump a girl in the canteen. That's the ambition. What else? I'd like to say something to the president. - I'm her, what's that you'd like to say? - Can I say it now? Go ahead. See if I like it, because this interview's over if I don't. Don't you dare use the informal speech with me. Okay, two minutes and fourteen seconds. So, this is what they do in acting schools? It's the basics of the Absurdism, according to them. I'm hungry. Let's order a delivery. I'd like to go out. No. That's too bothersome. Don't you think you're too lazy for an actress? What's wrong with an actress being lazy? An actress should be swift, and enthusiastic. Can't we just order it? Okey dokey. - Go home after this, okay? - Okey dokey. What shall we get? Fried dumplings. They won't deliver only one order of dumplings... I think they do. I've seen it in the movie "Oldboy". Wait. What's the date today? Today? I don't know. Why? It's the 9th anniversary of "Night and Day" soon. - What's that? - A bittersweet romance in a faraway country between Kim Young-ho and Park Eun-hye. Whatever. Also 10th of "Woman on the Beach" and 20th of "The Day a Pig Fell into the Well". We've got to celebrate them. Give it to me. Let's try something we've never tried. Like liu san si or liang zhang pi. - But those are expensive. - I'll chip in. - Why are you like this today? - Hey, Hong Sang-soo's moving forward, so it's time for us to move on, too. La zi ji's less expensive. La zi ji, la zi rou. La zi ji? You've never tried it, right? - No. - Okay, then la zi ji and a sorghum wine. - A wine? - You've never tried the wine, either? - Yes I have. - It's really strong and bitter. - I mean with la zi ji. You are trying it today. I might regret it. Guys are all cowards these days. It's only thirty bucks. It's not about the money, I'm considering my taste. You're suffocating me. You standard freak. Hello? It's Rose mansion 1301. Can i get la zi ji delivered? Okay, then I'll get la zi ji and one sorghum wine, please. Hey, the shot glass. Right, can I also get a pair of shot glasses, please? Good. I'll pay with my credit card. Thank you. La zi ji it is. Come on, my la zi ji, sweet mine. Hurry up. It's hot. - So hot. - La zi ji. - The sorghum wine. - La zi ji. Open up. This is odd. Looks like sweet and sour pork... but with more soup. We can eat rice with it. Kimchi, too. - Let's dig in. - Yeah. Thank you for the day drinking. Thank you for the day fucking. Would you keep down with your dirty talk? Where did you get that word? I just made it. You're talented in that area. Come on, let's toast. To Hong Sang-soo's ten million tickets record! Do you still watch his movies? Still? We're together forever. I was thinking about it, and it's not that hopeless. - What is? - Ten million tickets. I shall be a millionaire, and buy all the tickets. Will a millionaire do? A billionaire, then. There's another way. - Another? This country's population shall be over ten billion. That's sweet of you. Smells nice, doesn't it? It's okay. You're acting tough. Feed me anyway. This, and this one together. Mushrooms too. Right, you've got a big mouth. Here, I can't get the mushroom. It tastes good. Or is it a good taste? - It's nice. - Adventure successful? Successful. Yummy, la zi ji. Yummy. I think I'll go after this all the time. Right. It'll be calling my attention for a while. Thanks to me? Yes. I know it's because you feel sorry for your girlfriend, but it's much better to see you being obedient. That's not right. What are you doing on Christmas? Being with your girlfriend? Which day, 24th? 25th? I guess both. Don't you have a family? Shame on you. I should be spending nights with her. Are you fussing again? What about you? I'm busy too. I'm done with analyzing lines in "Home Alone" last year, so it's characters this year. Seriously, I've seen a movie lately, a very serious one, and it had a lawyer on it. He looked sincere, but I sensed naughtiness inside of him. So that made me wondering... and I googled him up, and found out... that he was the tall thief in "Home Alone". Really? He was a lawyer? Yeah. You see how good I am? He wasn't even a main character, and remained serious all the time. Yes. You're great. - Bring me a beer, please. - A beer? - Mixing up gets you drunk. - Shit, just do it. Are you not seeing anyone these days? Give it to me. I can't afford to meet a guy right now. I can't afford to meet a guy right now! So what? I can't do anything about it. It would be better if I pass the audition and get the part. I wish I had a sugar daddy. What's wrong? He'll like me and support me. Don't you know the movie "The Secret Scandal"? You've got to earn it fair and square, not by those weird ways. I didn't watch it. But you're right, it would be weird if my lover pays me. Of course it is. Are you doing that thing? That... handing out your resumes to the agencies? I need a portfolio video to do that, but I don't have one right now. Shoot it yourself then. I was trying to, but then I lost my confidence. You lost what? I mean I don't know what to shoot. How about, you know... the famous scenes from the famous movies? - I want to shoot something different. - Like? Like a good actress pretending to be bad at acting, or the reaction of a heartless person who finds out that her secret lover's already taken. Is it possible to show that? Can you? I don't know. Those are just what I'd like to shoot. Well... do you think they'll like those? I mean... I think you should try ordinary things first. I'm sending signals to them, that I'm not interested in common parts. You've got guts. Are you sure you'll be acting in Korea? Yup. I've scored twenty percent in English test. What's it got to do with acting? It matters. - But... - No. You're doing it wrong. I just gave it a thought, and I wouldn't work with you if I was the film director. You're not talented enough to be a director. That's why I'm not. I have some ideas for short films. Why bother? You don't have money to shoot. Money can't stop me from thinking. Alright, go ahead. I am at the filming scene, forbidding passers-by to enter. And this wicked-looking schoolgirl's insisting on this path. I say "Sorry, but we're shooting a student film here, and we'd be grateful if you detour." But I can see that this girl's annoyed. While this is happening, I am frustrated too, because I, actually an actress, am not supposed to do this chore. The girl's still insisting, even though there are other ways. She's gone so far to say this, "It's not gonna be a great movie anyway, so why bother to block the path?" I got furious and told her to watch her mouth, - then she calls someone. - Who? Her father. She says, "These self-titled artists are doing some movie crap, daddy." And her father turned out to be Bong Joon-ho. He wants to talk to this one in charge, and I get to have a talk with him. He asks me about my college, my professor, and the scene my crew's shooting right now. So I explain him about the film and my side of the story, and suddenly he understands and hires me. - That's the story? - It's amusing, isn't it? Well... Yeah. Kind of. What's wrong with Bong's daughter? Does he really have one? Is she in school now? Is she a girl? Don't know. I think he has a son. That's not the point. Focus on me and my story. I think it's dangerous. Maybe it's only for the cinema fans. - What's dangerous? - Your thoughts. What if Bong Joon-ho hates you after that? No, my darling Joon-ho would understand. There's another one. Listen. Say I've decided to shoot a film. So I bring the scenario and proposals... to Lee Chang-dong, the film director. I think I've heard of him. - "Peppermint Candy", "Secret Sunshine", - Well, maybe. - and "Poetry". He's the best. - Right. I know him. So I visit him, and tell him... "I'm going to shoot a film, sir. Here are my concepts." and he replies, "Good for you. I'll have a look." He thinks I'm there for some advice, - but I say this to him. - What is it? "I want you to be my assistant director." - Only that offer. - But why? Well, I'd feel safe and secured if he supports me on the spot, like printing out schedules for me everyday. So, is it a yes from him? First, he gets shocked. He should call some friends to talk about the offer, someone like Jeon Do-yeon and Song Kang-ho. And then the maestro gets deep in thought, facing the irony. That's the end of the movie. What do you think? Well... So you... So you want to work with maestros? I don't think so, but maybe I'm interested. In what? Being a maestro? Why not? I can be. Being a maestro's easy. Make a film, get acknowledged, teach wannabes, and get old. And when someone calls you a maestro, you say... "I just want more than shooting films until my dying day." And that's the maestro. You want "more" than that? Isn't it "nothing more"? Good, anyway. I wish you to be a maestro one day, and make me regret. Of course I will. So, right. For me, I think, among those two stories, I think the first one's a bit better. Yeah? You have popular taste. But I can write one too, that looks so easy. You're right. Sometimes idiots like you write better. I think... I'd write about a tragic romance. You've never suffered from STDs. You're not adequate. By the way, By the way, my girlfriend tried to be an actress, too. What kind of actress? I have no idea. She said she was in high school... when she went to an acting school. She's not that pretty, from what I've seen. Are you, then? I'm a character actress. But your girlfriend looks dumb. Maybe she's acting in bed for you. That's enough. So? What happened after the school? After that she went to the auditions, passed a few, but she refused. - What does she do now? - She's a student. Does she know about me? - No. - And your trip to Japan with me? - She knows I've been there. - Did you tell her it was all by yourself? Do I have to tell her about you? I bought you a Shinkansen ticket and the noodles. You were not alone. Do you want me to tell her that? You should. Also about the night I was wearing the kimono for you, and about your expedition t that perverted condom machine. - Also about your erection problem. - I don't have an erection problem. You had one at that time. - Don't spread your rumor elsewhere. - I don't forget things like that. I was too drunk then. - Anyway, - It's always alcohol. Anyway, whatever happened there, I can't tell her everything. Especially about you. All right. - Are you still in touch with Min-hae? - No. Am I the only ex who's still in touch with you? You call this being in touch? - You just barge in. - So, I'm the only one? Yeah. You? Well... I have one only for calling, and another one avoids my calls, but I stop by and talk when I'm drunk. That's me. But you're the most comfortable one. Maybe that's because of the time we spent together. Are you going to marry your girlfriend? I don't know. I mean if you have to marry someone, is it her? Maybe not. Guys are always like this. Yet they say they will, in front of their partners. Guess I have to. I should. It's not nice to say no in front of her. Why do you go out, when you don't want to marry her? - Dating is not all about getting married. - But at least... dating begins when you're attracted to the other's charm as a wife. - That'll naturally come one day. - Not for you. Did you think about marrying me when we were going out? Yeah. See? That's how it's supposed to be. We're not dating anymore. People go out and break up. And who knows if you'll marry me? Me? You? Us? What's wrong? I think that's likely to happen. Denying too much makes it true. It'll never happen, but if it does, it's one of these. Either you became a billionaire, or I was dying from the need to go through a divorce. Don't deny it, you could have loved me forever. How can you be sure? I wouldn't stick to you if it were not for sex. No, I wouldn't even if it were for sex. No, you'll sleep with me even when you're married. No, I would never ever do that. You don't know how I'll seduce you. Someone thinks she's a femme fatale. I'm full now. - Hey, let's play a drinking game. - With wine? No. Let's do it, rock-paper-scissors first. No, I'll suffer from a hangover. The sorghum wine doesn't have one. That's nonsense, it's still alcohol. Trust me. Drink up, throw up, then you'll be fine. I'm not interested. - Let's use my glass. - I said no. No game for now. Loser gets the drinks, rock-paper-scissors. Drink. Drink it up, drink it up. Now, my wish. - Hurry up. - Sorry, it won't come out. Now, my wish. Loser does what winner wishes him to do. Bullshit, I just had a shot. That's how this game works. You just made it up. - It's my wish or two full shots. - Come on. Don't make up the rules. Alright, tell me your wish. Well... - I want a kiss. - Fuck off. - A kiss? - I mean on my lips. It's always been on the lips. No, I don't want to. Alright, then drink. It's two. Wait, alright. Be quick. It's your job. I made the wish. - Never mind. - Alright, alright. - You think I'm harassing you. - Alright. Alright, I'll do it. Be kind and come closer. You're too far. Come on. Come on, let's just get over with this. Seriously. I said come closer. It's far. It wasn't on my lips. Could you make it count? Alright. Come closer. I've come up with my wish. I'll reject your wish. You gotta win then. Rock-paper-scissors. Did you actually learn how to lose? These two fingers will screw up my life. - Never mind. I'm not a sicko. - Alright, alright. What's your wish? Do I have to drink again? I'd like to have this one instead. There's some left. Go ahead. I'm drunk at my own place. - Hey, let's sleep together. - What? I mean, do it. We did it a while ago. You go sober after drinking. Same thing happens. - It's that or three full shots. - Are you in a gang, for real? Alright, then sing. I haven't heard you for a while. Fine. But you need to earn eighty points from me, - or it's three shots. - It's your own rules again. No. I'm fair in a situation like this. My first name is Fair. Alright. What shall I sing? "Proposal", "The Blue in You". One of them. I'm fascinated by these songs lately. How about a pop song? You traitor. Can't you be more independent? Okay, "Proposal". But I need to see the lyrics. "Proposal"? By Noel? - Twilight. - What? Never mind. I'll drink. Noel means "twilight" in English, right? Don't speak English. I don't understand. Got it. I'm listening. Be a good audience. Here we go. I told you to wait but ignored you for a long time Wait a little more and the day will come someday I know what you want and how long you've been waiting And now I say it You don't have to cry don't cry look up and smile now I will make you smile I'll only give you happiness always beside you Although it's not love darkness fades away when we're together Time gets colored with light and flows again with you in my eyes Chapter 4 Somehow You should really go after this. I'll go even if you beg me to stay. I can deal with it. See? - I'll do it. - Okay. - Did you spill something? - Just wipe it. Don't come back. Were you a mother-in-law in your past life? You're awful. Give it to me. Don't wipe with it. Finished. Come here, it's clean now. Did you leave? Why did you leave without a word? I had to clean it up all by myself. Who? That handsome guy? What did he say? He wants to meet you? I'm not interested in whatever text you've got. Why did you have to hurry anyway? I had to clean it up all by myself. Whatever. Don't you dare come again. And don't you dare call me. Don't call. I forgot the lyrics. "Don't answer" Answer me, "Don't answer". Are you sleeping? This number's not answering right now. Leave a voice message...
