No! Ugh! ♪ She's my ♪ kinda girl. ♪ Yes, she is. ♪ She is my ♪ kinda girl. ♪ Oh wow. What is it? She's an eastern water dragon. They can grow up to 4ft. You can touch her. Her name's Juliet. Has she ever bitten you? That was supposed to be for Romeo. He can be annoying, like most boyfriends. Please, Mommy, can we go? Sweetie, 7 is too young to be going to an anti-nuclear march. Oh, sorry. Did you let the puppies out? Excuse me, ma'am. Do you have worms? They're for our dragons. They're called Rocky and Mr T. What do they like the most - dried or alive and wriggly? We have both just along here. It's not about that; it's about the men cutting down our forests. Don't you know what they're doing? - Honey, who told you that? - Jodie did. Do you know how many people live on the planet? Uh, yes, no. 4.4 billion. - Rainin' Cats and Dogs. - That's too many. How can I help you? Uh, yes, we have that. Till... 5 today. OK. Mommy, look. He's done a peepee. Oh, sweetie. Jodie, could you please help Mrs Martinez? And when you're done, can you start feeding the birds? Honey, please leave the puppies in their pens, OK? Aw. Help! Jules? What are you doing? One of the kids opened the cage. Damn Bertie got out again. Can't get my arm under. He's way at the back. You so owe me. - Yeah, he's right at the back. - Yeah, I can see him. Hang on. Got him. Come here. Oh. Aw, he's just a rat. A cutie too. Just put him away. One day, you'll find the pythons, Bertie, and that won't end well. Where is she now? We've really gotta find another sitter. Yeah, like we can afford that You saw the letter from the bank? Not overdrawn again? I'll go see them. We'll find a way. Mom? I think Reggie's eaten his brother. Your turn. I did the puppy. - I did the rat. - You did not! Oh, Reggie. You bad axolotl. Ew. Where's the lizard's arms and legs? I'm guessing inside Reggie, sweetie. - Ugh, that's gross. - He's not a lizard. He's an amphibian, like some of the oldest, baddest dinosaurs. Why did he do that? Mm, hungry, territorial. Or the water change. They can be sensitive, cos they breathe through their skin. Look. So slimy. You know, if we took him out of the water, he would turn into a salamander and hunt on land. What would he hunt? I don't know. Anything that moves. K. Damn filter's gone again. Come on. Let's go tell Daddy and see if he can fix it. You wanna come? Mm-hm. OK. Thanks a lot. Oh, I'm sorry, sir. We're closed. - I'm looking for Ben Adams. - That's me. How can I help? Amos Tilbury. I wanted to talk to you about your mother. Uh, Ben's mother passed away a few months ago. I know. My apologies. My partner was her lawyer... before his stroke - poor guy. Um, I've been trying to go through his old files, but if now is inconvenient, I can come back. No, uh... I'm sorry. This is my wife, Jules. - Hi. - Hi. Uh, do you wanna come through and sit? Sure. Excuse the mess. Uh, we live in the apartment above. Ben's renovating the kitchen upstairs. UC Davis. I hear it's a good programme. Yeah. Last year of vet school. It's a bit stressful on top of everything else, but we are hoping to open a practice as part of the store. - Hm. - Yeah. Um, you said something about my mother's files. Yeah, I... I didn't know your mother. And, uh, everything in her file appears to be in order. There was, however, an old deed I came across emptying some boxes that had been filed incorrectly. It's for a coastal property in Oregon. My mother never had property anywhere. - Mm. - Certainly not up there. Well, it's from 1935, in your father's name. He bought land on the Oregon coast at the end of the Depression, little place called Hobbit's Bay. Never heard of it. How did something like this get overlooked for so long? Well, it was before our firm's time, and... well, we had no record on file of your mother ever owning it. But it would have passed on to her. Looks like it got forgotten after your father's death. Isn't that a little bit strange? I mean, people don't normally forget about a place they own, do they? Well, some families have secrets. You'd be surprised at what people find out after a loved one dies. In all my life, she never once mentioned this. Can I keep all of this? Of course. I appreciate you coming by. Look-Look, I don't mean to pry. There was one other thing I found. Are you aware of what happened to your father? He and my sister died in a car accident just before I was born. Why? Well, according to this, they were swimming at Hobbit's Bay when they disappeared. My mother never spoke about them much. She never wanted to. Um... But why would she say it was a car accident if it wasn't? Well, Ben's mother was institutionalised for most of his childhood. She was never around much. Sorry. I just thought you should know. Legally, the property's yours to do with as you wish. I do have a local agent who can help advise. What do you wanna do? - Well, how far away is it? - Well, it's quite a drive - halfway up the Oregon coast, just north of Florence. I could get my office to give you the directions. Are you sure this is it? Oh yeah. Are we there yet? Almost, sweetie. You sure this is safe? We'll soon find out. Hold on. Now what? I'll take a look. Hey, there's something through here. Archie. Archie! Come here! Oh wow. It's a palace. All my dreams have come true Do you think it has power? Sure. How do you think you heat the Jacuzzi OK, stand back. This is a dad job. Well, a little bit more air and light - I think it's got potential. Hey, slow down. What's in here? Can we go upstairs? Sure. Come on, Archie. Come with me. Hey, be careful. Some of the floorboards might be rotten. OK. Wow. Hey, can you give me a hand with this? Oh, don't worry. I got it. Ben? Quick, come here. What is it? You all right? Look at this. It's incredible. Didn't I say things would work out? I love you. [STONE COVER SCRAPES, THUD! What is it? It looks disgusting. It's a water tank. All these old types of places would've run off rainwater or a bore, if there's an underground spring near here. You're not going in there. - It's just a water tank. - Ben! Hey. Come here. Come here. 'Ben? Ben! 'What can you see?' Not much. What's that? Just an old lantern I found in the dirt. Can I go in there? Sweetie, I don't want you to go near this thing, OK? Promise me? - Promise. - Yeah, good girl. Go and help Mom. Honey! Where do you want our bags? I got pillows and blankets too. Uh, up here. I think this is your parents' old room. What are these? Mm. Must be Granny's. Was this her? She was beautiful. Yeah, she was. And that little girl would've been your Aunt Rosie. I think this is jammed. It won't open. - Yeah? - Yeah. Oh yeah. Someone's nailed them shut. Probably just thought the place would've been broken into. Sugar and Meg-Meg want to know where their room is. Well, I saw a very special room downstairs. Shall we go check it out? Mm-hm. All right, come on. Jump on. Downstairs. Giddy up! Yeehaw! Whoa! Help! ♪ Drifting in a day not yet begun. ♪ 6 o'clock and peaceful ♪ and serene. All here, like everything was just left. Right. ♪ Floating in a Technicolor scene. ♪ Something nearly peaceful ♪ in the sound. ♪ Rising from the ♪ San Andreas ground. ♪ Overground... Hold this. ♪ Underground, it starts to rearrange. ♪ You better get up ♪ and run for a doorway. ♪ Look what I found. Do you think that's here? I don't know. Could be. Check this out. It's a bunch of news clippings about the area. What do they mean? I don't know. I got dozens more. They're all similar. I mean, there's an insurance claim here for another ship that ran aground in the early 1900s. This one says some of the crew went ashore and were never seen again. Look at this. I found them in your mother's room. They're reports of your father and sister. Tilbury was right. According to these, they did drown here, but their bodies were never recovered. They suspected her? That doesn't make any sense. I mean... she was secretive... a bit crazy, sure, but... You should see your face. You think my mom's a psycho. Uh... - Maybe it runs in the family. - Oh, shut up. What was that noise? - Nothing, sweetie. Just- - I'll clear this away. It's just the wind, OK? Come on. Off to beddy-byes. Come here. - Goodnight, Daddy. - Goodnight, angel. Sleep tight. Come on. OK, here we go. Who's that? That's you. - This is Daddy. - Mm. That's Grandma. I miss her. I know, sweetie. We do too. But she's in a better place now. Can you read Wind in the Willows to me? Just for a few minutes. Who's your favourite this week? Badger. He's so grumpy. No, wait. I like Toady. He's the funniest. Yeah? 'Like Summer Tempests Came His Tears. 'The Rat put out a neat, brown paw, 'gripped Toad firmly by the scruff of his neck...' She's asleep. What you looking at? Found it downstairs. It's your mother's diary. Yeah, this is her handwriting. She used to write me from hospital when I was a kid. - She never remarried? - No. Never saw anyone. She used to say when Dad and Rosie died that it was fate. To God, be grateful for what you've got, and all that. Well, I think you're doing a hell of a better job. You know, it's strange when your parents die. You start thinking about them differently, like... how they were to you, the decisions they made. How youare to your own child. How you'll never do what they did. What do you wanna do about this place? We could really use the money. And it's fuckingcreepy. It is! Yeah, well... it is. I mean, this place was so special to them. Why didn't she want me to know? Thought you would never ask. Let's find out. 'April 27th, 1946. 'We have moved in, 'and I am my new self again.' LINDA... my new self again, with none of my dark sadness. It is just the beginning of our new life here with Rosie, and our child grows strong inside of me. Alec is determined we be comfortable here and has had a man come in and build a water tank. And this week, they drilled more than a hundred feet to the deep spring that has water sweeter and more nourishing than any I have ever tasted. A package arrived today, completely anonymously. It contained newspaper reports about our bay. Alec told me to throw them away, that someone is not happy we are here and is trying to unsettle us. Alec was up all night with the storm again. When it cleared, Rosie and I took our early stroll along the beach. He was not there for his early morning swim. And when we returned, I could not find him anywhere. He has been gone for three days. I alerted the local police, but they assure me he will return from wherever he has gone. Rosie misses her father terribly, and I fear for his safety. 'May 5th, 1946.' That's the last entry. The rest is missing. Rosie disappeared on the night of May 10th. What happened in those five days? What's the matter? You don't wanna know what happened? Oh, this is just so crazy. You know? This is her all over again. She-She- She never told me the truth. Never. Never what I wanted to know. Now I have to accept that. I don't know why she did what she did or what even really happened, but... she's gone now, and I never will. - You're not slightly curious? - What difference does it make? She did what she did. Mommy. Sweetie. Something's trying to get in. 'Stay here, OK? 'Ben. Get up.' 'What is it?' I-I don't know. I'm still on the stairs. Go back to bed. Shit! Don't do that. You'll give me a heart attack. The terrace door doesn't shut properly. - Oh my God. - What are you doing? Nothing. I'm... I thought I heard something. Let's go to sleep. Don't do that. You just... scared the livin' days out of me. - It's funny. - It's not funny. ♪ Sometimes lovin'... ♪ is so, so hard ♪ to do. Hey! You're up. I didn't wanna wake you. Thought you could do with the sleep. Fridge is running. Hungry? No. I can't believe I slept in. What's all that? Oh, it's just junk - old tools, lots of fertiliser. We should keep Reia outta here. It's high ammonium nitrate - what they used to make bombs with in World War II. Even some old fuse wires still here. Found some old gas, but we're gonna need more, so I'm gonna head back to that station tomorrow. What? What is it? Doesn't this place make you feel uneasy? Well, first night in a new place is always a bit weird, but that may be because I woke up with Meg-Meg staring at me with her creepy one eye... and a unicorn up my nose. Could be that. Why don't we just call someone to come in and fix it? It could be just a shut valve. It's actually quite nice in here. - Are you sure about this? - Can't be that hard, right? Wish me luck. Well, it looks like it goes a long way back under the cottage. If there are any monsters or psychos, don't let them out, OK? You bet, honey. Damn things. Agh! What can you see? There's a pipe coming in from the hill behind and another below that must go to the pump. Hang on. I'll see if I can open it. Ow. Shit. It works! We've got water! Damn it. Any luck? Oh. Did you hurt yourself? Uh, it's just a scratch. Found a tunnel and a sort of cave behind the tank wall. Looks really deep. Must be where the water comes from. Oh! Great. Pump still works. Oh. Pure spring water. Maybe we should start bottling it. Could be a new thing. OK, let's not, uh, close the store just yet. Look what else I found. Oh. Where did you find this? It was in the mud, in the tank. What do you think it is? Well, it's not a fish. It's some sort of amphibious larvae - not fully formed. These are its gills. Yeah? See the rear bone spurs? They turn into legs when they move on to land. Look how slimy it is. Like, look. Oh, yeah. Wow. Holy shit. - What's that? - Hm? It's solid. That's where its eyes should be. Maybe it's subterranean - evolved not to need them, like Apoda amphibians. - What does 'Apoda' mean? - Uh, 'the blind ones' in Latin. Do you know how devilishly sexy you are when you speak Latin? I do, actually. What do you think it's doing here? I don't know. Maybe it's attracted to the water. It's pretty incredible. Pretty frickin' weird. What do we do with it? Mm, we should try preserve it. Someone will wanna study this thing for sure. Where's that cooler? Oh, there. OK, but you better win an award for discovering this thing, whatever the hell it is, cos that was my lucky Led Zeppelin shirt. I'll buy you a new one when I'm famous. Hello? Daddy? Is anyone in there? Daddy? Ah. Mommy! What is it? Are you hurt? There's something in the tank. Why is this open? She could've fallen. It sounded like the one in my room last night. What do you mean, in your room? Honey, there's a lot of animals in the wild here. Please. I told you not to look in there. Probably just the sound of the water pipe. Hello? Is anyone home? So sorry. Th-The front door was open. I'm Merial Tingey. Mr Tilbury asked me to come and see you about selling the property. I couldn't call. I hope now's OK. Uh... 'course. I'm Ben. This is Jules and Reia. Glad you found us. It's a bit of a hike, isn't it? I thought I might get stuck, so I left my car at the top and walked down. I saw you from the hill. Do you wanna go upstairs and play while we talk to the lady? I remember my father coming here years ago with a buyer. But your mother's lawyer was adamant she'd never sell. It truly is a magical spot. Yeah. It's a gorgeous beach. Well, not just the beach. You realise the property extends a lot further than that - several private coves, most of those hills in the distance as well. Well, we only learned about the place last week. It's the last remaining untouched block of its size up here. From what I can recall, I believe the cottage was originally built as a whaler's shack in the early 1800s. Uh, do you know who owned the place before Ben's parents? I don't. May have even been abandoned. There were a lot of protests when he bought it - locals especially. They thought the place was cursed, but... I'm sorry about what happened to him. Uh, you said curse. What do you mean by that? Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Uh, the big Cascadia earthquake in 1700. It hit from Canada down to California. This coast was completely torn open - sent a tsunami all the way to Japan. The Siuslaw people said the land was bad and abandoned the whole area. Theysaid it was cursed. Said, uh... the ground opened up deep, and people would disappear. It's just a silly old story. Places have them. I'm sorry. I hope you don't think this presumptuous; I made a few calls before I came, and, uh... well, I have a buyer who's interested. They've made a strong offer and would move quickly, if you wanted. Oh, that's fast. There may be a little room to go up... for a quick sale. - Oh, this is a lot. - Is that serious? It's a lot more than I think your mother ever thought it'd be worth. And if you want more, I can ask- No. No. Yes. Yes! The buyer's in town and keen to close a deal, so if you have time to meet, then... well... my number's on there. You'll wanna talk, a-a-and no rush. Sorry. Thank you. Can I give you a lift back up to your car? Thank you, but, you know, I think I'll enjoy the walk. Oh, wha-? Ben? Are you awake? I'm asleep. Shh. I think I hear something. That. What's going on? You OK? I-I just saw something at the window. What? O-Over there. You sure? There's nothing there. Yes. Yes, I'm goddamn sure. It had big teeth and claws. It was right there. It was probably just a raccoon attracted to the light. - That was no fucking raccoon. - OK, just calm down. OK? I don't wanna scare Reia. There's nothing out there, OK? I-I just want us to go. I just want us to leave. Look, I'll call Merial tomorrow and meet the buyer. We can sell it in the next day or two and never come back. OK? Come on. Oh, come on. Ah, shit. What are you doing? I thought you were going to the gas station. Go inside and play, sweetie. Have you seen Archie? He came up from the beach. Uh, maybe he's around back. I'll have a look when I go. - SIGHS: OK. - Look at this. Found your intruder. It's just a raccoon. Must've got in under the house somehow and drowned. That's what all the noise would've been. Poor little guy. Look what else I found. You see what's tangled in it? I think we need to call the police. They need to look down there. I'm gonna go to the gas station. The Badger drew himself up, took a firm grip with his stick with both paws, glanced around his comrades and cried, 'The hour has come. Follow me, ' and flung the trap door wide open. They were but four in all, but to the panic-stricken weasels, the hall seemed full of monstrous animals. - No, more! - We can read again tomorrow. It's early. Do we have to? Afraid so, beautiful. Hello? Is anybody there? Hello? Anybody? Hello? Reia! Come on. Come on! Reia! Reia! Jules? Jules! Where are you? Jules! Up here! - Are you all right? - The tank lid was open. Something came into the cottage. We need to leave. - What is it? - Merial, the estate agent. She's dead. Something attacked her. I radioed the sheriff. They're sending someone. They said to lock the doors and wait for them. We should, uh- We should get Reia dressed. I found out what happened to your father and sister. They didn't drown at the beach. They died here, in the cottage. There's something in this place. That's why no one lives here, why your mother never told you about it. She never wanted you to know, to evercome here. She lied to the police. She made the whole thing up about them drowning. It's the rest of her diary. 'I trust in God I make it away from here 'and out of this hell and my poor family can be found.' Mommy! She wasn't crazy like they thought. No. She thought they'd take you away if she told the truth. And the last thing she wrote was... 'Whoever finds this, forgive me, '... and this. - Where are we going? - Just for a drive, sweetie. Just wait here with Mommy. That's the sheriff. I'll go get him. Hey, wait! OK. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! No! Shit. - I heard a gun. What happened? - He's dead. He's dead. It killed him, that thing you saw. Wait, wh-what did you see? It was like some kind of reptile. Didn't have any eyes. Shit. Hey. Hey, Ben. Ben? Hey. Just breathe. OK? Breathe. Breathe, please. What the hell is this thing? I don't know. I don't know. We've gotta go. - No, we can't. - No, we haveto go. - We can't go! - We have to. Whatever it is, it's still out there. OK, there must be a nest somewhere behind the tank. All the noise we've been making, the pump - it knows we're here. That's what the scratching is. It's just trying to get in. Maybe we can make some noise, lure it back into the tank, somehow bury it in there. How? That lid doesn't stop it. There's spare gas in the shed. Mixed with that fertiliser, it's highly explosive. I can rig a fuse. You can't go back in there. We don't have a choice! It's gonna kill us in here. It's the only way we can stop it. You and Reia stay upstairs. Lock the door. Whatever happens, don't open it. No, we can make it to the car. No, we can't, baby, not with her. When it's set, I'll come get you. We won't have much time. You come back, OK? You come back. Hey. Stay here, sweetie. OK? It's OK. Archie. Ben! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aaah! Aah! Hey, sweetie. I need to go see Daddy. I need to go help him. You just stay here. Don't move. OK? Mom! Mommy! Sweetie. Sweetie. OK. Just be quiet, OK? Mommy! Mommy! Aah! Mommy! Mom! Daddy! - Reia! - Daddy! Ah! Reia! Reia! Reia! Get up! What happened? Where's Reia? It took her... into the tank. The fuse... It went off too soon. You can't kill this thing. I don't need to. I just need to keep it away from me long enough. What are you doing? If it's an amphibian, it breathes through its skin. This will burn it like acid. OK. If I'm not back, get out any way that you can. I'll come find you. I'm not going anywhere without you. Come on, Jules. You can do this. 'Reia? 'Can you hear me?' Reia. Reia? Can you hear me? Call to Mommy. Reia! Mommy! Hurry, Mommy! I'm coming, baby. Just wait there! Reia! Mommy! 'Reia? 'Reia?' Mommy! Come on, sweetie. We gotta get outta here. Come on. They're coming back. OK. Climb through the hole, sweetie. - I don't want to. - You have to, sweetie. Archie and Daddy are waiting for us. OK? - I can't. - We don't have much time. - I can't. - You have to. Brave for Mommy. OK? Go now. Come on, Mommy. I'm scared. Come on. Let's go. Baby. Sweetie, climb, OK? Go, go, go, go, go. Hang on, sweetie. I'm gonna get us to the car, and then I'm gonna get Daddy, OK? Come on, Archie! Get in the car. Get in the car. Archie, get in the back. Get in the car. Get in the back. Where are the keys? OK, sweetie. I'm gonna have to go back for Daddy and find the keys. You both need to stay very still and quiet. Can you do that for me? Count to 100, and I promise I'll be back before you're done. Baby, wake up. Wake up. I need to get you to the car. Where's the keys? OK. Come on. Here we go. One... two... three. 99... 100. Hurry, Archie! Get out! Archie! Mommy! Are you OK? Archie, come on! Aah! Mommy! Get out of my car! Is Daddy OK? Yeah. He'll be OK. Yeah, yeah. Gonna clear that track. All this has gotta go.
