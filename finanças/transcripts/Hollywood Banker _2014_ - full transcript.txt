My name is Rozemyn Afman and I am the daughter of Frans Afman. My father was a prominent Dutch banker who had always wanted to write a book about his adventures in Hollywood. He became a major player in the independent film industry during the 1980s. To help him, I started interviewing him as a labor of love. But it became for me, a journey of discovery into my father's life and times. Marker A and B cam. Oh, I have to do it in English, right? Yes, we are doing it in in English. Okay, are there any questions from the audience? That's very funny. Actually I do have a question. Papa. What would you like to know about Frans Afman? Oh, um... Yeah, I think the... What is interesting I think that... How is it possible that a guy from a medium Dutch bank, a medium-sized Dutch bank was able to invent a completely new structure for film financing. Because I am a simple banker. That's probably the only question, the rest is not interesting. Let me tell you about the era of Frans Afman if I may. You have no idea the amount of power this one man truly wielded. With the wave of that finger. Well, he needed this one also to sign. Oh, I thought it was the middle finger? No, no, no. He had to use the both of them together to sign the things. He pretends he's a producer, but in fact he is a PR person. Give you another story. I would go to the, to his offices in Holland and he'd have a waiting room, and the waiting room was the who's who of Hollywood. You'd sit out there, They would be sitting there like this. From Dino De Laurentiis to Menahem Golan to Andy and Mario, who were coming over. They would all be sitting around and waiting. We'd be like little children, waiting. They would get the financing that they need, they would get solved their problems, they walked out with the solutions. Over a period of more than 20 years, my father financed over 900 films. He did so through two European banks he worked for. First, Dutch Slavenburg's bank and later the French Credit Lyonnais. He played an important role in the creation of films such asSuperman, Platoon, andDances with Wolves. And he was instrumental to the rise of many independent production companies like Cannon, Hemdale and Carolco. The '80s were a lot more fun. Can I get your autograph? I want to get your autograph. I didn't think you existed. BRUCE McNALL A very entrepreneurial, go get 'em, play things loose and fun, enjoy what you're doing, that world of the '80s. Which was more about people and less about the numbers. Without Frans, independent film would have been set back decades if not more. For the old timers like me that know that, it's kind of, you know, yes, you guys are all riding on this wave and great fun but the history is interesting which was, before that it just hadn't been done. I needed your father when he was there. Someone who believes absolutely in what movies can be. He is probably, in many ways, the best-known banker in the history of Hollywood. 'Cause most people don't know who the bankers are. Frans gave us the money. Now it is time to tell the truth. How much money are we talking about? We asked for one million and he gave us three. What happened with the other two? This is probably from the '80s. From a very young age, I developed a huge adoration for my father. There was a fifty-year age difference between us. As a young girl, I never understood what he did for a living except that he always wore a business suit. Which impressed me. I remember very well that there were pictures taken on a beach in Los Angeles, where I got a sense of his importance. As I grew older, I became more and more intrigued about what he exactly did. By sheer coincidence in the early '70s, I believe it was '74. I met with Dino De Laurentiis. Everything that I did in the film business, I owe to Dino. He earned his stripes already in Italy. He already had two Oscars. One wasNights of Cabiria and the other wasLa Strada. He was interested in getting a bank account, a normal regular current account in Amsterdam because they were in the process of setting up a foreign distribution office. He couldn't rely anymore on the Italian banks. And that's perhaps when he met Frans and the owner of Slavenburg bank. And they seemed to be open to get into that business. I said, "How do you finance your pictures? "How are movies being financed?" And he was laughing at me and he said, "Well, you are a banker, aren't you?" I said, "Yes, well I'm trying to play that role." He said, "Bankers never ask that question "because they hate the film business, "they don't want to get involved "and certainly not in the independent motion picture business." The Citibank, Bank of America. No way. Of course they had corporate accounts with the major studios, but independent producers were always turned away. The studios used to have their cluster of writers, their cluster of directors, their cluster of stars, under one roof. And they all kind of cross-collateralized their ideas, the creativity, and was very safe. They want their certain tent poles and franchise movies or the romantic comedies that are sure winners. They want to love their scripts before they make them. Scripts aren't always perfect. You know, you've got to decide on something and then try to make it perfect and then go make them. And that's where your father was very important. Because he gave independent producers chances to make their movies. As a commercial bank, we could not invest in films. But we could, perhaps, finance films. I see a film as a project like we financed real estate. We were based in Rotterdam, so obviously shipping was a major activity of our bank. And I said, "Why not films?" And he said, "Well, let's sit down "and let's see if we can find a structure." It all began with Dino saying, "Frans, I'm going to teach you how to really do the film business "and the foreign sales, the discount contracts." Frans had lunch with Dino, practically three times a week for many months. I remembered that my father in his free time, he was very active in culture. He booked stage plays and guaranteed a certain amount of money. He thought, "Hamletwould be played by a major actor or "Midsummer Night's Dream, I will certainly have three nights fully booked "and so then I can guarantee a certain amount of money." And with that in my mind, I said to Dino, "Couldn't we lay off the risk to the distributors in the world?" There are a lot of independent distributors in every major country. And we give them the script. We tell them who are going to be in the movie, an idea about the cast. And that system was basically invented by us. By the two of us, Dino and myself. And that was the system of pre-sales. And in his autobiography, he describes us as the pioneers in the business. You want to make a film, okay. So what do you do? Where do you start? So what you do is, step one is you get a script you either write it, or buy it or option it, but somehow or the other you get ownership of some script. Step two is, you want to get somebody to be attached to direct and star in it. We maybe had our director attached to it, maybe we had an actor or two. And that was what we call our package. What I now do is, I go down to the American Film Market or to I go to Cannes and I go meet all the foreign distributors, and I say, "How would you like to buy my film for your territory?" "It's going to be wonderful." And we sell them, and they go, "Okay, we believe in you. "We will buy the movie today, "and you will deliver it to us eight months from now or a year from now, "and let's agree on an advance we are going to give you." So I have a contract from the German distributor now for a million dollars. They haven't paid me cash, but they have given me a binding contract. And that contract would be called a "pre-sale." And that pre-sale we would take to a banker. Who could we go to? Oh, Frans Afman. We would take it to Frans and Frans would go, "Hmmm." "They looked good. I trust the people that are going to pay. "So yes, I will loan you the ten million dollars to make your film. "But, how do I know, Sky, that you will get the film actually completed?" So the completion bond company comes on and says, "Mr. Banker. "I guarantee you, don't worry. "I am an insurance company with billions of dollars behind me. "If something happens, and an actor dies or the director quits "or for whatever reason. "You don't need to worry." The bank then loans me the money. When it is done, hopefully on time and on budget. I now say to the completion guarantor, "I did my job, you're done." I now deliver the film to the foreign distributors. They pay the more than ten million dollars back to the bank. Hopefully I make a profit either from the amount I've sold it for is more than the cost of the film or if the film works, I will get what's called overages, which is royalties. So, that is the essence of how the pre-sale market works. I can't remember what the first one might have been. Were you there during Three Days of the Condor? Oh, that's good, yes. It was Three Days of the Condor. And what it really was is that the tax shelter group set up an account at Slavenburg's bank and Frans helped us do it. So it wasn't very expensive for us. Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway in danger and in love. InThree Days of the Condor. My bank had absolutely no idea about film financing. So, they said, "Are you sure that we get our money back?" I said, "Well, sure, sure. You can never be sure. There is always a risk. "But I have a good feeling. I think the distributors, I checked them out. "I think they really have the intention to pay us "once the picture is delivered." My feeling was not so much about whether the film would be a great success. Because actually, that was nice, that was the icing on the cake. But the purpose of the loan was to get the money back. He had the intelligence to use Dino. I mean, really use, to Dino's full acceptance and agreement to teach him what he what he should do and what he should be careful about. The times that they were together were so important that they were together, because they were making things happen. And you have this euphoria when you are making movies. You are creating. And Frans felt that too, because he was part of that process. This business is very seductive. So they shared that, Frans understood that passion. They were very close. Believed in each other. I think Frans might have looked up to him. Dino never looked down on Frans. The big one was in 1976, when he did King Kong with Dino. The studios, they paid attention to it. This model could bring big-ticket movies, that we don't have to finance. So, it was a tremendous risk management. The studios needed product. With King Kongthey go, "Oh, this really works." We'll take a distribution fee, and Dino and Frans Afman can take all the risk. That was a major film for that time. And that was a very expensive movie. We completely financed that movie. And during production, the costs went up from $18 to $24 million. All and all, that film made a bonanza. Not that we benefited from it. We were very happy with an interest margin and a closing fee, and that was it. So, maybe we made three percent on the budget. After working with Dino for three years, my father had mastered the ins and outs of the movie business. Dino then offered him a job as his private banker but my father respectfully declined. He wanted to stay at Slavenburg's bank, while discovering Hollywood for himself. Dino was disappointed but understood his decision. While Dino remained his main client, my father started to work with other producers. The difference between Frans in relation with other people working in the bank business for movies, he has one great quality, he has the feeling about the movie. I'm not surprised if one day, tomorrow, Mr. Frans Afman resigning from the bank and become producer. Because our business is a tough business. You must love it to do that. Now, wouldn't that beat all get out... You... Huh? The first project my father worked on without Dino would turn out to be very complicated. Unknowingly, Slavenburg's bank had become involved in a film project calledSuperman. Superman is an interesting story. I got a call from the president of the bank and he said, "You have to come immediately to Rotterdam." "To the head office. We need to see you." I thought, "My goodness, have I done something wrong?" "No, no, no, but we need you." I said, "I have meetings today, I cannot cancel my meetings." He said, "You will have to cancel all meetings, "it is very urgent you come to Rotterdam." So, I arrive in Rotterdam. The whole board is sitting there. I never forget, in the boardroom. All faces, very long faces. I thought, "My God, what is going on here?" They said, "We just discovered "that we are financing Superman." A man by the name of Alexander Salkind was planning to produce a Supermanpicture. He found a bank officer in this small village of Zutphen, in The Netherlands. And that officer had authority to advance up to, I think it was a $100,000 dollars. When the bank examiners came to look at Slavenburg's, they found that, uh, Mr. Salkind had borrowed, I believe, $32 million. We were in shock because we didn't know about it. We didn't know... Small amounts, with a subsidiary of the bank. And, so, they all were looking at me and said, "How are you going to solve that?" I said, "How far are we with the production?" "Well, we are somewhere midway." So, I went to London. The picture was shot at Pinewood. All the producers got together, the Salkinds and Pierre Spengler. And I said, "We have to go on. There is no other solution." Frans with his expertise in filmmaking and all that came on board and said, "Wait a minute. We are not going to leave that in the subsidiary, "we are going to take it over with Slavenburg." And this was the first, uh... The first, really, let's say, official encounter between Frans and ourselves. They resolved a lot of uncertainties that we had. Very crucial was the screening. Because I asked Pierre, "Show me the stuff, show me the material "that has been shot so far." And I brought Dino in. Dino De Laurentiis. We saw maybe an hour of material. And Dino pinched me in the arm, he said, "It's good stuff, Frans. It is very good stuff." And that also was part of my decision to move on. Somebody thought it was a great idea if Superman would restore the White House that was badly damaged by the bad guys. Good afternoon, Mr. President. Sorry I've been away so long. I won't let you down again. You needed another 250, I remember. Another quarter of a million. And I said, "If this helps the film, we have to do it." So, Superman Iwas released, was a huge success. At that time, immediately I started working on finishing Superman II. A guy named Marlon Brando, an actor of some note. A guy named Dick Donner, a director of some note had sued Alex Salkind for not receiving the moneys they should have received. On Superman Iand Superman II. He turned out to make two movies, when he was supposed to be making one. They were pretty slippery, these guys. And what they had done, and they didn't inform the cast or anybody. They shot a lot of footage. And they had enough footage from this Superman to do Superman II. So my goal was to get in and make sure the plaintiffs got their money. Knowing it was gonna be very difficult to get much out of Alex and his companies and people. Your father said very sternly, "I will make sure that every penny that is lent to you "will go into the film "and not into anybody's pocket." Eventually Superman II came out, it was again a big success. And there we finally were able to sit down and make the account and say, "Okay, now we are able to pay all the participations. "Start repaying the bank." And it all worked out. After solving all the problems withSuperman, the board of the bank encouraged my father to expand the film business at Slavenburg's. While building his clientele, a lot of independent producers came to Rotterdam to seek financing for their movies. And I remember when I came in, everybody was running around. And I said, "What happened?" And there was some sort of... Of foreclosure or something that was taking place. Nobody was there. I had this interview and I think Frans wasn't there. There was some sort of problem and I said, "What is going on over here?" What happened was that the Dutch tax authority had raided the bank because they suspected it of money laundering. All the senior management were taken into custody, including my father. Even though he came out clean, he had to stay home during further investigations. My mother told me that I was conceived during a very difficult time. It was quite a big thing for me to learn, while making this documentary. I am the youngest in the family and I have three older brothers. I did not quite understand why my mother made that decision, if you already have three children. But I guess she hoped for a little girl to soften my father's feelings. This helped me understand my adoration for him. When in 1983, Credit Lyonnais acquired Slavenburg's bank. The French management learned about my father's activities in the film industry. They liked the business and saw a lot of potential for growth. So, they asked my father to completely focus on film financing. With their support, he put together his own team and created an entertainment division. It required a level of knowledge of the distribution community and how it worked and where the movies worked. That was just simply not there. Frans had that knowledge and basically created a business that became, you know, huge. Billions of dollars by the '90s. Action! Action! The same kind of excitement that my father felt by working with Dino De Laurentiis, he found in Israeli filmmakers Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan. Their enthusiasm and dedication were so stimulating to my father that it became one of his most productive partnerships. A producer... - Must get everything that the movie needs. - Yes. No way out. - You have learned to speak Dutch? - Oh, a few words. And then we got from you, I think a line of four or five million dollars to do the small action movies. I tried for a low budget that we did low-budget movies to make a film look big. I was always scared of you, because you are the big man. Big Frans Afman. Yoram had to speak to you. I was quiet. But I was making the movies, and... He was quiet? What is going on here? Frans, we will go into it that he was quiet. What about this stupid fire? You're an officer today. You're an officer today. Next month you will not be an officer. Don't make me angry. I will shoot when I want. You can arrest me! Menahem... Did the Ninja. He invented the Ninja movies. If you take on a Ninja, no matter how many you are be prepared for the consequences. Enter the Ninja from Cannon. He was in the Philippines and he... And then it was Credit Lyonnais already. And then the Philippines wanted to kill him, the people, for the $50,000 that he owed them. I owed, yes. "What should we do?" I called Frans in the middle of the night and Frans tells me, "Come to Rotterdam." That is how it was. We sat in Rotterdam, I think, for one day. We plan. And instead of 50 we got a line of $25 million. And that's how we started to do The Wicked Lady, That Championship Season, Sahara. The first upgrade movies ofCannon. First movies with stars, real stars. I always wanted to learn. I wanna learn more, and more and more. Because I have always said to my boss in the bank, Georges Vigon, the moment that I have to defend a credit facility. And I tell you, "Georges, you should trust me, because I know the business... "You have a free mandate to fire me on the spot." Frans got a very special permission from Credit Lyonnais to join the Cannon group board of directors as independent board. Your suggestion, your ideas, were always... I accepted them. You are a very smart man. There are a couple of Israeli's here who would probably steal their thunder and sell it back to them at a profit. Golan and Globus may sound like a couple of Middle-East cities... For many years, they were the king of independents. They were so prominent during the Cannes film festival. Their parties, their pictures. They made wonderful pictures. You had all these media promoting your film essentially for free. I thought Cannon made some good films. Barflystill holds up today. I can't stand people. I hate them. Oh yeah? You hate them? No. But I seem to feel better when they're not around. We had the feeling that, when you bring a star to Cannes you capture the buyers. I'll do the movie because they couldn't pay me a lot of money. I said, "Okay, but I want a Rolls Royce." He says, "Okay, I will give you a Rolls Royce." And we bought him a Rolls Royce! What don't you do for these stars! And he came to Cannes, and it was a big success. So I thought he gave it to me for real. At the end of the movie some guys came and said, "We're taking the Rolls." Legendary story. I enjoyed having coffee with Frans or a drink. Much more than with Menahem. I liked, you know, very classy, elegant guy. Menahem always had like gefilte fish and, uh, all kinds of things all over his shirt. I could tell what Menahem had for breakfast, lunch and dinner on his red shirt with his white suspenders. But this guy was a class act. Somewhere in the '80 they came to see me and said, "Frans, all these movies "but what about the movie theaters?" I said, "Yeah, it seems to be a problem." Because video became so important, that there was less attendance in the movie theaters. And many so called "experts" decided that this was the end of the movie theaters. I helped them with the acquisition of the Gaumont theater in Italy. I helped them with the acquisition of... A couple of theater chains in the United Kingdom. And eventually I was able to assist them with the acquisition of the famous Tuschinski theater chain here in Holland. As well as the City theaters. Everybody said, "The unions in The Netherlands are terrible "and you will go bankrupt in six months." And we said, "In 12 months all the theaters "in the big cities will be ours." And that's what we did. You fixed it. And they ask us... First of all we said that we believed in the future of cinemas. As long as there is use, cinemas will exist. Then they asked us, "What are you doing to the cinema?" Do you remember our answer? Just clean the toilets, first of all. Once the toilets are clean, it begins. Then you change the carpets and you change the chairs. Did you ever sit in Tuschinski One in a chair lately? Impossible to sit. You know, it's like this, you can't put your knees. We are changing those chairs because I understand Tuschinski is an historical place, but it doesn't mean you cannot sit on a chair. From the director ofChinatown andTess: Roman Polanski. Polanski's epic adventure. ForPirates my father had high expectations because of the great reputation of director Roman Polanski. The movie was shot on location in Tunisia and starred Walter Matthau. It was Roman Polanski's pet project. Tarak Ben Ammar, the producer could not control him apparently. So, he was not moving. And Tarak said, "There is very little I can do, "but maybe you can do something "because you have the right to remove him from the project "and replace him by another director." We had done that before with Superman. We had replaced Richard Donner with Richard Lester. I went to Tunisia to meet with Polanski and apparently, my chairman also joined me. We had a lot of money at stake. Then finally, he completed the picture, but it was a terrible picture. I remember the film was shown at the Directors' Guild in Los Angeles for a selected group of people. They all loved Polanski, because of Chinatown, and Rosemary's Baby, what have you. A man of great reputation. And of course Roman Polanski was allowed to enter into the United States. Only to serve time there because of his affair with that young girl in 1977. So there was a video message from Paris that he was greeting everybody. All his admirers et cetera. And during the film, I felt already the atmosphere, they were uneasy. And then when the film ended, there was dead silence. People couldn't believe that Polanski had made such a terrible movie. To understand the importance of my father's accomplishments. I wanted to personally meet the people he worked with. I went to interview many of his colleagues, like John Miller, the banker at JP Morgan Chase who finances many of the blockbuster movies for the major studios. He looked at this business... In a way that would be very difficult today. Because, I think he... He trusted somebody, he got to know them. He made a lot of decisions, I think, based on his instincts about who he was doing business with. I was making a film and the film ran out of money. It was called Never Too Young To Die. And we were just about to start shooting, and we were shooting and I was in trouble. So I remember, "Oh, Frans Alfman." I gotta call Frans. So, I called him up and he said, "Ah, the prodigal son comes back." And I explained to him the situation. He says, "Give me your bank account number." I said, "Really?" He said, "Yes, I trust you. How much money do you need?" And I needed half a million dollars at that time. He says, "I'm going to wire transfer you that money." And he says, "We are going to do the paper work after." He says, "Because I am going to take you at your word." Everybody who got a major credit facility had to appear in front of my board. We had lunch in Rotterdam and dinner if necessary et cetera. And we treated him well but they had to come to Rotterdam. And one of the producers once said in an interview for television, he said, "Yeah, Rotterdam was a coming and going of famous producers "and they all had to sit on the couch "until they were asked to come in. "And if you got the handshake, then it was okay." But that's not how we worked, of course not. As you know, Frans is a... He loves wine. He is a great authority on wine. So we were discussing the next pictures and Frans spoke to the two board members and said, "Right, let's make a bet." He bet that they did not know, the original five Grand Cru wines from France. And they were two Frenchmen, so it was a matter of honor. Over dinner, Frans won the bet and they agreed to finance the next two pictures. Of course, I took it with a pinch of salt. I went to the office the next day, they presented to me the note, signed by the two board members, that those pictures would be financed. Those two next pictures were Hoosiersand Platoon. He took a far more creative approach to the business. He was interested in the content, he was interested in... And was willing to take the risk. 'Cause he could see... Read the script, understand who the director was, who the producer was, who was starring in the movies. And he was willing to take a far higher level of risk than an American bank would've taken. And he did it well. Domestic banks were less comfortable with those foreign distributors. They had more regulatory requirements. They were not as flexible as the European banks, and specifically Credit Lyonnais. And that I think, is what allowed Frans to dominate, in those days, because the American banks couldn't compete. The first picture that we did with Frans was The Terminator. With James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger. And Frans was very instrumental in bringing that together. Because he would guarantee Arnold Schwarzenegger's fee. Which, I think at that time was relatively small by today's standards. About a million dollars. But it had to be put forward and a guarantee before the picture was financed. Frans Afman and Credit Lyonnais have had a financial hand in a wide variety of pictures. Among them, Hemdale Film smash hitThe Terminator. Hemdale's president, John Daly. I think his biggest contribution was withThe Terminator. None of that would have been possible had Frans not supported us. Extremely loyal to people that do business with him. And in fact, he is almost a father figure. Frans was very savvy. And he understood what it meant and he was looking beyond just a single picture. He was looking to help, um... The principles of Hemdale build a company, build a library because the library became very, very successful and it became valuable. Why do you think the independent film industry was dominated by companies that were run by foreigners like Cannon, Hemdale and Carolco? Well I think this is a melting pot, you know. America is a melting pot. And Hollywood is the center of the film industry. Or Los Angeles is the center. So it's natural that everybody from abroad gravitates towards America because the actors were here, the directors were here. So, naturally we were all here. They did not work well within a studio bureaucracy. I mean, visually, when you look at these people, if you look at Mario and Andy, they don't look like people you would see in a studio. Our philosophy was that we want to give the independent market the same kind of movies that the major studios were releasing. And in fact, it turned out that they we were beating them with our movies. So, our goal was really not to compete with Cannon or Hemdale but was to compete with the major studios. Hollywood blames us for destroying the prices, even though that isn't true because they are the ones that destroyed it. The studios made less money upfront but they give each star a big backend. A percentage of the gross. So consequently, if a picture was really successful, Carolco was better off. If the picture was not a success, then of course, Carolco was worse off. I remember in particular that there was one transaction at Carolco where they committed to a three million dollar script literally on the back of a napkin. It was the Wild West, it was truly independent filmmaking. So, you definitely saw with certain members of the independent world, it's like, you know, "Enjoy it now, "because it is not going to last forever." So, they were much more liquid, how they entertained. And they were having fun. We had the party of parties. It had an unbelievable collection of talent, all working with one independent company. All right? Financed by Credit Lyonnais. We had Schwarzenegger, we had Stallone, we had Michael Douglas, we had Sharon Stone. You know, Jim Cameron and Oliver Stone. Come on, I want you to get this. The party was great. What was on the menu? I don't remember the food. I really don't remember the food. We drank, we had a great band, the Gipsy Kings played. I don't think we will ever have a case, where an independent company can have the number one worldwide grossers back to back, like we did in those days. Hello, Tony. How are you? Can we talk with you just about the Cannes film festival. Is it important for you to be here and meet with your clients? Always, always. Yes. Already for 16, 17 years, I come out every year basically to learn. Because this is the place where distributors, exhibitors, producers meet each other and do deals. And we like to know in what financial condition everybody is. So, we talk to all the foreign distributors in the world. Unlike most bankers, he knew all of the distributors around the world. Frans could get on the phones himself and call Toho-Towa or GAGA, or whatever it was and help solve problems. He was very pro-active. If there was a problem that was taking place on a loan, and there's always problems, with everything, he was there. He was by its side, he was part of the solution going on. He was involved, literally, in everybody's business. In a good way. We got to make that picture, specifically because of your father. At a certain point the bank, through the French lenders, had lent too much money to Hemdale. And Frans and I came up with this deal where we bought the library rights to those Hemdale titles for 40 million dollars. And we had to put back for ten. When, as expected, Hemdale defaulted on paying back the ten, I went to Frans and said, we have to levy on the sequel rights. We made Terminator for six and a half million. Terminator 2was made for close to 120 million. I've always wanted to see the frontier. You want to see the frontier? Yes, sir. Before it's gone. Ain't nothing here, Lieutenant. What about Indians? We approached all the American studios. From Paramount to Universal to Fox, you name them. And everybody had basically four reasons to decline. I was very honest about what it would be. I knew it would be long. That didn't mean I thought it would be boring, but I knew it would be long. And I knew that there would be subtitles. The American studios in those days, well they still are, they are very nervous of subtitles. They don't want to release subtitled movies. I knew that those subtitles were important. That two people could not talk. They didn't want to back a first time director. Everybody has been a first time director once in his life. Okay? "No, no, we don't like him as a director." Okay. Reason number three not to do the movie, it was too long. Three hours and 20 minutes. The reason that's a problem is you lose a screening every day. So you're losing money, just because of the length of the film. And the number four reason, it was about cowboys and Indians, basically. And so, this very American movie would not be financed by anybody here. We have no American deal. Let's first start with the foreign contract. Let's see if there is interest. And we were just lucky, because that same summer The Untouchableshad come out. The Untouchables was a great movie with Bob de Niro and Kevin Costner. And Kevin Costner was brilliant in that movie. So everybody who hadn't heard of Kevin Costner knew thatThe Untouchables was a great movie. Guy East said, "This is unbelievable "We get offers from everywhere "from Japan, from the Far East "from Europe, from Latin America. "I think we can cover 60 percent of the budget "out of foreign pre-sales." Unbelievable. We went to the markets, we made the sales then the cash started flowing. We went to the studio and said, "Listen, "Foreign people are already so interested in... Foreign distributors, "about this project Dances with Wolves, "That I think... "I am surprised that not one American Studio has picked it up." Even though it was an independent production and the money was being provided by the banks, you needed the studio's distribution arm, their prints and advertising money, you needed them behind you. Nine million dollars was raised by the European community and I will forever be thankful for that. Once Hollywood realized I was going to go make this movie, interest kind of started to grow a little bit. But I went to a studio that I had been familiar with, Orion. And they gave me four million dollars. It took Europe to move the dial for me. And action! Scotty! I used to go to South Dakota and watch them where they were shooting. Kevin used to rent the local cinema every night and everybody from the set could go and watch the dailies. Which was incredibly unusual. And then when you saw the stampedes and things like that. And Kevin did all the stunts himself. He went out on a horseback and he rode in the middle of hundreds and hundreds of buffalo. I mean, he could easily have been killed. There was a lot of people who were laughing behind my back about it. Lucky for me, I was out there making it and I was unaware that there was this kind of skepticism, this cynicism, with me directing a movie. The movie was a massive success. We collected an enormous many, many millions of dollars in overages. It was nominated for I believe, 12 nominations and it won nine Oscars including Best Director and Best Film. You know I think, when you are in the movies sometimes the hair on your arm can stand up. Or on the back of your neck. Sometimes you can't stop a smile. Those are the emotions that I believe in when the curtain opens up and the lights go out and the movie starts. So, Frans changed our lives by helping us make the movie and the movie changed our lives because it was so successful. It changed all our lives. Although he traveled a lot while I was growing up, I never missed my father. He was always there when it mattered. And furthermore, I didn't know any better. At what age do you become self-aware? For me, it was our time in Malibu, when I was three, four and five years old. Those are my first memories and it made a huge impression on me. During the summers, we joined my father in Los Angeles. We would arrive at LAX Airport. Two stretch limousines would be waiting for us. One for our family and another for our luggage. We were chauffeured to the luxurious Malibu beach house where we enjoyed a private tennis court, a swimming pool and a jacuzzi. On weekdays, we were picked up by a yellow school bus to go to a summer camp in Topanga Canyon, where we could ride horses, play sports and do other fun activities. Our playmates were the kids of Dustin Hoffman. Bruce Willis and Demi Moore were our neighbors. There was always a lot going on. Stars would walk in and out of the house. It was a special and magical time a little girl can only dream of. Platoonwas an enormous success. And that one really knocked the industry on its ass. Because here we are with a $5.8 million movie shooting in the Philippines with no actors, no stars that no one knew of. And we pulled it off. Oliver had served in Vietnam during the war, so he knew what he was talking about. And it was a very serious project. But not everybody was interested. Especially not in America. You needed, apart from the foreign distributors, you really needed a deal with an American studio. It is all about your script. If your script is good, you are going to get it done. First I read 50 pages in my office and I called Oliver. I said, "I'm doing your movie." He says, "Not so fast." "Go home and read the script, and then call me tomorrow." My wife and I were in bed together. She was reading a magazine. I started reading. I was nailed to the story. When I was finished, I was sobbing. I had tears in my eyes. We were trying to get the most difficult shots in the most difficult manner possible. In the rain, special effects, no big budgets, nothing. It was just a struggle from day to day. It was the first real look of how people were getting limbs blown off, dying. And the stress of what war was like. And I think that hit a nerve here. They had never seen anything like this. They were used to the John Wayne type of movies, where it was all about America and America being triumphant. It wasn't real. This was real because Oliver had been in Vietnam under two tours of duty. The moment we cut the movie, we showed it. It took off. There was a fire to it, I can't tell you. That is really about populist timing. In the sense that we hit the right moment in time. That button. So, we released it in six theaters, two in LA, two in New York and two in Toronto. On opening weekend, which was in December of 1986, we would see veterans standing in line around the blocks in New York and LA, trying to get in. And the letters, the outpour and the media, which is often the most cynical off all, was like puppy dogs in our laps, looking for stories. There was a line that ran for two blocks. And I see all these people and I had no idea that it was for our movie. And as I drove up we realized that it was all for Platoon. The nominees for Best Picture are... In the year 1986, the films Credit Lyonnais had financed received 27 nominations and won eight of them. This was much more any studio achieved that year. And the winner is Platoon. Thank you very much, I am deeply grateful. My profound thanks to John Daly and Derek Gibson. For sharing my passion when all others passed. And Frans Afman of Credit Lyonnais, for having the money in the Philippines jungle when I really needed it. It was every banker's dream after that, that the winner of the Best Picture of the academy award would mention their bank. It is the only time I've ever heard a producer thank its bank for anything It was a slight exaggeration, because I never went to the set. I never went to the Philippines. We just transferred the money... The money from Rotterdam to a local bank in Manila. He had that Dutch confidence. They're always like... Very convincing. And as a banker, I thought he was a godsend. I was just a kid from Ohio. You know? And I didn't really have any experience with European... Style or personality. And Frans is an example of what I call an old school, you know, style. He had his emotions, he had things that would upset him. But you know, he was always so careful and polite. I always wondered when he would sleep with your mother if he would take the suit off? I used to kid him about it. And he would laugh, you know, give me a nervous laugh. I remember going to the Cannes Film Festival and walking down the Croisette when Frans was there. He was more famous than most of the movie stars. "Hello, Frans. How are you Frans?" You know, people that were obviously sucking up to him. He was a target. He was the best game in town. Nice to see that you are alive, that you are here. And kicking. Some of the movie stars Frans was very friendly with, because he was the banker for the people that used him. Like Sly Stallone for example. He loved it. He loved the experiences of... Interacting with everybody. With the big movie stars to just business guys. And I think everybody respected him and they liked him. They especially liked him when he used to walk around the Hotel du Cap with a briefcase full of cash. Especially Golan-Globus, when they got money from him they said, "By the way, you know, we want our money in cash." A lot of the companies were colorful characters. And his great quote that he said was, "If you are going to swim in the ocean, "you better swim with the sharks." And he just... He knew how to deal with them and use their wisdom of the film industry to his advantage, to make sure that his film loans got repaid. How many times he turned to me and said, "I wouldn't lend this guy ten cents, Buckley. "But we will drink his champagne." I said, "Okay." With all the success my father had it was rumored that some clients paid him money on the side. Besides this, to let him keep working during the summer he was provided with a beach house for our family. Later in the industry, it was said that he was bribed. Is taking a summer beach house a bribe? Yes, technically it is. You know, it is funny, the word "Bribery" is a tough word to use, I would say. But all bankers, at that time, and I think some to this day today too, will probably have perks. All of my bankers would come to the King games, I'd buy them dinners. Various things. We didn't view it as a bribery. They were friends. Frans's take was that, this is the way things are done in Hollywood. It is a way for me to keep an eye on the money. Whether it fit the rules of Credit Lyonnais? Frans said it did. I cannot accept any gift from any client. And I cannot give any gift to any client. But I'm invited all the time to go on people's yachts and to do things. If I went, I would report it and my institution would allow me to do that, then I wouldn't consider it a bribe. It wasn't hidden or secret or running around and doing clandestine things. Or Frans saying, "If you don't give me this house "I'll... The loan's going to get called." Bruce McNall had promised me some financial reports. And he did arrive at a party and he handed... He handed a brown envelope to me in front of 150 people, that were standing there. And guess what was in the envelope? His financial reports. And later on they invented that is was $100,000 or $200,000 in cash. And you think that I would be stupid if I ever would be bribed that I would accept the bribe in front of 150 people at a reception? You think I'm that stupid? The productive partnership between Cannon and my father was put to the test when Yoram and Menahem wanted to expand and diversify Cannon more than my father was willing to finance. When they failed to listen to his arguments my father decided to stop financing them and resigned from their board. Not long afterwards, they were close to bankruptcy and in desperate need of money. They made a tremendous amount of movies out of their studios on Sunset. They saw a chance to get out to cash out. And they cashed out to Parretti. And God love them for it. During the Cannes Film Festival, I was asked by Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan to come to their suite. And they wanted me to meet a certain Mr. Parretti. And from the first moment on, I understood that this man was not going to be a friend of mine. Because he shouted at me when I came into the room and he was pointing his finger at me, "You, Afman..." "How much money you make in the bank?" And I said, "That is none of your business." "I triple it. I triple it." I said, "What do you mean?" He said "Yeah, you come inside my company." I said, "But then I would have to leave the bank." "No, it's not necessary, you stay in the bank "and at the same time, you work for me as well." I said, "Okay, nonsense." Parretti basically tries to bribe Frans right there in the meeting. All right? And of course, Frans, very politely, you know, "Okay, I understand that." He was talking about 400 million he was going to put in the Cannon group. I said, "Fine, you can pay off some of the loans "that we had made to the Cannon group." He said, "No, but you have to loan it to me." I went outside and said, "Yoram, you come with me." I said, "Look, it's very simple. "I dislike this man immensely. "So, I am not going to work with him. "So, you have to go to another bank. "I don't want to be involved." And, so we went back into the room and then I told him, "Mr. Parretti, there is nothing I can do for you." And then he became very, very angry and said, "Well, I'm going to talk to your boss, "Georges Vigon, he's in Rotterdam, "and I'm going to fly out with my private plane. And you will lose your job." I was representing Cannon at the time. And this crazy, little Italian showed up. And said he wanted to buy Cannon. I asked him some questions, he knew nothing about the industry he knew nothing about financing. It was just hilarious that this guy showed up. And so, I literally got up from the meeting and I said, "I have long meetings and I have short meetings. "This is going to be a short meeting. "'Cause you don't know what you are doing." So, I left. I found out that, indeed, my chairman, whom I admired because of his intelligence and his support for my business, had entered into a relationship with Mr. Parretti. My second in command said to me, "Frans, we have something to report to you." I said, "Okay, what is going on?" He said, "We are already 400 million out "on the Parretti and Fiorini company." I said, "I don't know, "why am I not supposed to know this? I am responsible." He said, "Well, the chairman of the bank took the responsibility "and we had to execute the orders." And I immediately went straight to the office of Vigon and said, "What is going on? I mean, I know nothing about this." He said, "Yeah, it's my responsibility." I said, "Yeah, but it's my people you're using!" Fiorini and Parretti had been bribing all the way to the top of Credit Lyonnais from Haberer on down. Including the socialist party kingpins, we later learned. And I know that, you know, this was something that, you know, would drive your father crazy. Because every bit of integrity that he cared about, every sense of people that he cared about. And he recommended, told the bank not to do it. Parretti, with Credit Lyonnais's help ended up buying Cannon. So, A, I had to deal with him until then Parretti fired me as counsel for Cannon, because I had walked out of the meeting with him. And then I was hired by Credit Lyonnais to oversee the subsequent investment, which was Cannon buying MGM. Buying Cannon was not enough for Giancarlo Parretti. On the contrary, it was just the beginning. And he had his eyes set on something much bigger. His next target was one of the oldest and largest studios in Hollywood. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, better known as MGM. Here comes Parretti, boulders into town, with money bags. Well, Dino's eyes go big, you know, "You know what, this guy wants to buy MGM? "He wants to buy something? He wants to buy?" "You know, let me show him around. This guy looks serious." We spent a lot of time together. We traveled together, we vacationed together. He actually is the godfather to Carolina. He was the best man at our wedding. So, I mean, immediately Dino was seduced and there was this partnership. Dino came to him and said, "Frans, you got to stop being against Parretti." This is bad for you and the bank. And he said, "I am never going to stop being against Parretti. I know what he is." It is a business that is so pressurized and so capital-driven that whoever helped you ten years ago might be your friend. But your best friend is the one that's helping you today. I saw with great sadness, a lot of my account managers were all of a sudden working exclusively on the Parretti and the Fiorini accounts. And to the detriment of our other relationships that we had with companies like Hemdale and Carolco and you name them, our other major clients. And I saw the whole structure that we had erected for the entertainment business, that was going to fall apart. And that was the day that I resigned from the bank. Voluntarily, totally voluntarily. And Vigon said, "Well, you have to stay until the first of July. "And then you will become a consultant to the board." They didn't want to lose me. I say that in a little arrogant way, but it was the absolute truth. Frans bowed out, but he nominally stayed involved because Cannon was his major client, so they had a lot of existing films going on. I see this all the time in industries where a banker will stay as a consultant for a few years to work out troubled loans, because he has the personal relationships with those people at the highest level of the companies that he's dealing with. Maybe I shouldn't have done it, maybe I shouldn't have stayed on as a consultant. Everybody was leaving. My whole team was going to other banks or people took early retirement, or people started to work for clients. I had 12 account managers, and only one stayed with the bank with the entertainment division. So, Credit Lyonnais ended up with no knowledge about the entertainment business anymore. Because all the knowledge had gone. And then some French people came and they took it over. It is one of the major disappointments in my life as a banker for the film industry which I always considered to be a labor of love. And I have done it with passion and I never had anything to do with crooks and thugs, et cetera, I walked away from them. The attention that Parretti brought in was just totally out of whack. And it folded, I think, what, within two or three years. I mean, he burned through the money, he basically hopped on a plane and got the hell out of Dodge. And kind of, left a wreckage behind him. Jack Lang, who was the culture minister, at request of the president of the republic, called Haberer and said, "You give Fiorini and Parretti whatever they want." All right? That's why it happened. And then they tried to dump it all off on the Dutch branch, try to make it seem as if, "Oh, it's some film stuff by Frans Afman." They tried to blame him for it. And... But, you know, I remembered the way he'd... I don't know how I would have handled something that unjust and that terrible and outrageous. But he handled it with the same aplomb, sense of humor and character that he did everything else. Just took it and... You know, he and I would always joke, "We're gonna have to write the book one day." Which we never did, you know? Because we both knew what really happened. This is Hollywood and memories are short. So, for those of us who were around then, it can still be a hot button. Today, people will just look at you puzzled, "That was a mess, wasn't it?" And you just say, "Yeah, that was a mess." And you just move on. After my father left the bank in 1991, there was a lack of finance for a while in Hollywood. The independent producers had to find other sources of capital. They went out and raised money publicly, they over-leveraged themselves they started to get into the exhibition business, they just went way beyond their core competency in many cases. Hemdale had financed back to back Academy Award winning Best Pictures. For Platoon, which costs 5.8 million and did 136 million at the US box office. And The Last Emperor, which they paid eight million for domestic rights alone and it did 42 million at the US box office. And guess what? The company lost money on both. Their accounting methods were abhorrent. And you talk about most of them, not all of them, but most of them had a luxurious lifestyle for their owner. The debt that I had was growing and growing and growing. It ended for me, when in 1994, I received a subpoena basically requesting documents and information, from the FBI. It is not a good thing you want to get by the way. It's not a good thing to have. Immediately, all my entities were put to bankruptcy, which included Gladden Entertainment. I went from, you know, two helicopters, three jets mansions all over the place to living in a small apartment. The companies that went out of business eventually, didn't have your father behind them. I think that if your father would have continued, he would have found ways to help all these companies. I think what happens, businesses go like this and in the tough times, you need good bankers and people to understand and help you get through those time periods. He was gone and it was very simple. Pay the money or you are out of business. And it doesn't quite work like that, sometimes you can't come up with the money on this date. Another great one is John Miller. John has supported many companies who could have gone under and he didn't... He found ways to help them and, you know, find solutions, which your father always did. Banks have become more corporate, you know, since Wall Street days. They seem to roll over bigger amounts of money. Like, they make studio loans, unfortunately, the studios get stronger but you don't have the Frans Afmans out there, who are backing individual film makers. Your father was unafraid. He had good sense. He had to make good choices. But he did. And some of the men and women around him, I'm sure, thought long and hard, they bet on a person, who'd never, in my case, ever made a movie. He built some of the greatest producer/production /sales companies in the business. He helped create that whole independent business, which still runs till today. No one took his place. No one had the... The goods. They didn't know how to do it. He was old fashioned, old fashioned in the sense that, whatever I can do to help you, I will. And I will support you and I will be there in really difficult times. Frans actually changed my life entirely, from being an employee to enabling me to be an owner. Which I have been ever since, for the last 25 years. He was totally changed my life. Yes, he was, you know, more than influential. He literally changed my life. What happened to you? Oh, I went to, I got many offers from banks. I became an independent consultant. I worked for a number of banks. European, Japanese banks, that I advised. And they thought that I had still a very good reputation. For me, it was sort of, post-graduate in the film business. He accepted the cycles of business. "I had my time." "The world has changed." You know? And he was educated enough that he was too close to the Credit Lyonnais scandal to not be affected by it. I think it is like a Greek hero. You peak and then you go down. He peaked. I mean, it's better to have peaked than never to have peaked at all. From time to time I realize that I have to clean up things and that I don't leave a total mess for my kids, they have to sort it out, so... I have to throw away a lot of things. The cleaning up time has to start very, very soon, I realize that. Forming bonds, you know? Forming friendships. And one of the best friendships I ever stumbled into was... I am so sorry about him passing away. A little emotional. I loved your father.
