Tuesday, 10.:30 Holocaust Memorial Day Hello? Okay, I'll come, but didn't we agree you'd try dealing with him? I see. Where's the kindergarten teacher? Okay, I'm on my way. Daddy! Drop me off at work, I didn't finish my shift. Michael, I was in the operating room all night. -I was busy too. They called you two hours before they called me. I know. -Then why didn't you call me? I didn't want to bother you in case you were in the OR. Great. Let me off at the falafel stand. You step out for one minute, they give you a shopping list. What happened today at kindergarten, David? We learned about the Germans. Remember we said that if something or someone bothers you, you should go to the teacher? We can't come take you home every day. But Shaul throws sands at us. Do you tell the teacher? She's at city hall. Say sand. Sand, not sands. I don't believe it. I wish this shitty day would end already. Take your ball. Just a sec. Tamar, get in. Let that asshole wait. What's your problem? Wait a sec. Put this in the back. What's your problem? Fuck you! Drive after him! Drive after him! Michael, drive after him! He drove away... Michael, drive after him, we'll catch him at the light! And then? What'll we say? It's okay, I got his license plate. I don't understand why you had to piss him off. So now it's my fault? It was only 50 seconds. Get in the car. Don't answer. It's your mother. She's having us over for dinner tonight, remember? That's why I got the falafel. She wants a truce. What... Shit. Foul Gesture Dad, let's go to the beach. Look. When is Holocaust Day over? -When the sun sets. He drowned. I was scared shitless, and you should've seen Michael, he went all pale, he froze. And I start yelling: "Drive after him!" I'm telling you, I wanted to kill him, I swear. Of course not, Michael is a rationalist. Need any help, Mina? -No thanks, David's helping me. Who wants some soup? David, move, you're in the way. Tamar, please, no. I'm begging you. Dinner's ready, come eat. Come on, David. How do you like the picture of you and Mommy? What is it that you want? -What? What is that? It's you and the little one. That's not me, can't you see? Are you playing dumb? Michael, what is this? It's the babysitter's picture. Well, I'll be damned! -We'll leave that for later. This isn't her? Are you stupid or just pretending to be? But you're so pretty here. -But it's not me. What did you want a truce for, eh, Mina? After all, I'm not good enough for your son. I dress David like a girl... I didn't say "girl", I said "pink". -Red, okay? It was red! Why do you hate me? You hated me from day one. I'm a simple woman, you can buy me with one kind word. I've heard how... I swear on your father's grave, you two look alike... We look alike? Where did you come up with that? But she's very pretty... -But I'm not! I can't take this anymore. Michael, we're leaving. Michael, sit down to eat... You can leave the picture there, it's not too late for your son. You think your son is such a good catch that no woman is good enough for him? I have news for you, Mrs. Kleinhaus. Your son is depressive. Doesn't work, doesn't do anything. I'm the one who's been providing for us for the past 6 months. C'mon, we're leaving. David, let's go. The hot and dry May weather had just begun. Michael Kleiner, not the member of parliament, someone else, felt all his thoughts funneling into one sentence.: "Die, he must die. " Was anyone hurt? Wednesday The guy ran into me, Wednesday I want him to pay for the damage, what don't you understand? I understand perfectly. You file a civil lawsuit on your own, not with the police. If you want I can give you his phone number. Next. -Okay, give it to me. I have to call him? Then what's the police for? You don't know what the police is for? Okay, give it to me. Call him, ask for his insurance details and... I'll be right back. Please wait your turn. Hours... It's Dreyfus. So can I... Okay, this is the number. Danny Ben-Moshe, this is the number. Fucking shit... Yes, sir! C'mon, move it! Michael. Hashmonai, what are you doing here? Police, I work with them. Too bad we never get together. You never invite me or anything. You're too good for me. We're family. Your son doesn't even know what his own uncle looks like. My cat scratched me. She's in heat, the bitch, and she's taking it on me. Someone tore the door off my car. You got into trouble with Dreyfus? Ben-Moshe. THE Ben-Moshe? 'Three legs'? C'mon, Hashmonai, you asshole, your flags are... My cousin, a writer! We'd spend all our summers together, remember? Who's this Dreyfus? Don't do anything without asking me first. Come on, move it. Israel Police... I'm putting you through to Bentzi. Don't put me on that tune. What did the insurance say? -She put me on that tune. It's not the same color, set up an appointment with the girl. But the door's tempered! Tempered? Bullet-proof. What?! I told you, it's not the same color, set up an appointment with the girl. I'll put you through to Nachman. I talked to Nachman, he told me to talk to Bentzi. 2 for 1 0! 2 for 1 0! He's on the phone, so hold. Not that tune again... -3 for 1 0! I know I don't have comprehensive insurance, but if you call... Bentzi, you're the insurance guy. Okay, I get it, I'll call, bye. Daddy! You remember to turn off stove in 20 minutes? -Yeah. My father was dying for over a year. I worked like a dog for 1 5 years. I can take time off. When you worked, you had time for David, for me, you had time to cook sometimes. Now you really are taking time off. Yes, I wanted to take time off and write. But you're not writing. How do you know? You never asked to read anything. Give me something. -Don't have any. So? If you were interested, maybe I'd have more to write about. I wanted to write a simple story about love... nothing. Michael, you're not writing and you're not happy and that's distressing for me and David. So because I'm not working, he's unhappy? Listen, I'm killing myself doing these shifts too. Shift after shift and constant yelling, the head of the ward yells, the nurses yell, the poor patients yell. I have to fill out a million forms about illnesses, I want someone to read me too and think I'm a genius! So leave your work too. What did you say? I heard. Thursday What do you do? Thursday Agricultural hi-tech. The man you're complaining about is Danny Ben-Moshe. Better known as Dreyfus, in case you didn't know... Better known by whom? -Magic Garden? No? Never heard of it? He was in the secret service, when there weren't any inquiry commissions, a hero! Isn't this a law-abiding state? -Of course it is. So... you file a complaint. So you say your wife gave him the finger... like this? Like this? Should I be afraid to file a complaint with the police? You think he's a friend of mine? The system's falling apart. The police's hands are tied. It'll take years. It's just a door... Put on Pink Floyd, let's have a smoke. Wanna buy? -No, thanks. Your wife? Come give Uncle a kiss. We're going to the park. What for? Come over to my place, I'll show you my cat. Bye. Come, David. Bye. -Bye bye. Way to go, man! Two women, nice house, and I just barely get by with my cat. She's the babysitter. -No kidding? Well, I've... gotta go. You know what? I'm going to the Magic Garden tonight. Come with me, check the place out. What for? -Check the place out. So you'll see what's out there. Sitting in the AC, as if you're in Switzerland! Have a drink with your cousin, that's what for. He was dreaming. Hello? Hello? I can't hear... Hello? Hello. Hello? -Hello. Mr. Ben-Moshe? -Yes. You ran into our car yesterday. My wife was standing... -Yes. Mr. Ben-Moshe? Hello? I don't understand what's going on here. Hello? Hello? Yes. Look, you ran into our car yesterday and the police said that you have to give me your insurance details. Bastards, is that what they said? In any case, I just want your insurance details. Leave me alone. -I will not! Why are you getting all dressed up? -Going out. You're staying home, right? Alone? -With Hashmonai. I thought you can't stand him. He's family. Does he need some money again? Is it legal? There's a party here on Independence Day, Deputy Chief-of-Staff is coming, could it be illegal? This is the cr?me de la cr?me of the crap de la crap. Is this also a hotel? -That too... I owe you, I didn't forget. You don't have to pay here. It's all on me. And what's your business here? -Flags. Is he here, this Dreyfus? Hard to tell. The machine can run without him too. What's he look like? He has a limp. Old guy. Invalid, 'Drey-Feet'. She's checking me out. Want me to introduce you? That's Nathalie. -No, no, no. Hey, baby. This is my cousin, he's a writer. Nice to meet you. Michael. Nice to meet you. Anna. His dad and my dad are real cousins. Where are you going? Curiosity killed the cat. Got a light? I'm not really a writer. Up until a year ago, I was in hi-tech. Are you troubled? Is the owner here? There are a few. Dreyfus? I call him Ben-Moshe. You know him? We once had a... You work here? Doing what? Bartending, I don't know, you know Ben-Moshe. My wife. I'm afraid she wants to leave me. I'm going to the restroom for a second. I'll come back, we'll get married. If he's here, he's downstairs. Who are you? Can I go in? No. Is Ben-Moshe here? Dreyfus. No. Are you paying for your friend too? Here you go. Tamar? Tamar? She was called up from the hospital, there was a suicide bombing. She kept calling you, she was very worried. Arcadia, you're not my wife. We were in an accident. Yes, Tamar told me. I went to see him, I took an iron rod and scratched his car. Because of the accident? He did it on purpose, he almost killed Tamar. They ran after me, but I got away. My car... You're sweating. Take your shirt off, I'll get you a towel. Towel... -No, no, sit. Want something to drink? -No. Mommy... I'll go, I'll go. He was dreaming. Look, Arcadia, I've been thinking about it for a long time, I'm not working, and our situation isn't... I'll take more responsibility over David, I'm home anyway. You don't have to leave yet. Will you be okay? Daddy. Come stay with me. I'll just say goodbye to Arcadia. Friday Where were you? I kept calling, your phone was off. There was no signal. I went to see him yesterday. -See who? The guy who ran into us. He has this place... I scratched his car. -What? Weren't you afraid? -Yes. What if he caught you? But he didn't. Kleinhaus? Were you at the Magic Garden yesterday? Was there a problem with the food? What do you want from me? We wanna talk to you. I don't wanna talk to you. Not with me. Sunday, 9 AM, Habima Caf?. I won't come. You know, Habima Theatre? You'd better come. Be there at 9, you'll be first. Shabbat Shalom. Hashmonai? I kept knocking and knocking. Where did you disappear to yesterday? The car's in the parking lot and you're running around. Let's have some tea and I'll roll us something. I promised to teach Arcadia how to read Hebrew. Where did you run off to yesterday? Didn't we say it was on me? What? I need a gun. Does this have anything to do with your wife? You know, you buy a gun against terrorists and end up killing your wife in mid-August. I scratched his car. -Whose car? Dreyfus, and they caught me. Michael... You don't buy a gun unless you intend on using it. These are not the kind of people you threaten. Here's your father's certificate. You'll need it for the Interior Ministry. I fired her because I was attracted to her. What? Arcadia. Sometimes I think, all we have left is that I... don't have the guts to split up. Depressing, eh? Sweet-and-sour shrimp. Soup. Fried crab... "The air was stifling. May. "He must die, wrote Michael Kleiner in his notepad. "But who, he thought, and why - he did not know." Saturday Sunday It's as hot as hell today. Daddy, what did you see over there? A dragon. I want to stay with you today. You can't, Daddy-O, I'm busy today. Bye, David. How did it go? He doesn't want to be there. Now he's afraid something's going to happen to you. Really? Really. Bye. Michael. -Yes, Mom. You're coming, aren't you? I told you I'm coming. Don't change plans on me. No, I'll be there right on time. Stop it... Don't you think these two women look alike? Mom, leave them alone. I'm a widow, no need for me anymore. We need you, Mom. I don't need you? -Like Preparation H. Do you want me to get divorced? -What will you live on? What are we here for? -No, your father's money isn't for living. lf, God forbid, the little one should need something. This one doesn't work, the other one does nothing but study... I worked my whole life, I have enough to take care of you too. There's no point to my life anymore. I'm worried about my grandson. Michael, don't go. Mom. They said it's not here. We'll wait. -Why wait? He's dead! He's dead, who should we get the certificate from? Him? Michael! -Mom! I'll explain it real simple. Shmuel Kleinhaus is dead. It happened a year ago. This is his widow. Now, there's life insurance. As long as you don't give us his death certificate, they keep the money. Okay. Sit, Mom, the gentleman will give you the paper. Guard! What's going on here? I was just joking around with him. You! Guard, come with me. Come here. Come here, sir... -Come on, you. Come on. I'll call the police. -This man is following me. Stop! What do you want from me? Stop, I'm telling you. Come here. What do you want? Why didn't you come? Come with me to the police. What's going on? -He's been following me since yesterday. Never seen him before. Need any help? -Come with us, sir. Why are you following me? David split his head open. Ouch. -I'll just clean around it. What happened at kindergarten? Shaul threw sands at me. And there was a rock in the sands. Monday Are you here about Ben-Moshe? Okay. He's in no hurry. Let's say I take security off the Prime Minister for a week and the entire police force is with you. What about next week? They're in no hurry, no rush. I don't want to meet him. Then why did you scratch his car? He tore my door off and the police said there's nothing to do. That's right. The police's hands are tied, the system's falling apart. The police force can't be on its toes for every door. It's not the door. Look, we were very lenient here. I spoke with him. I told him to reconcile, we're not babies. Go see him, he's over at Habima Caf?, you know, where the theatre is, till ten or ten-thirty. So he won't press charges. -For what? For scratching his car. It's just a door, he won't do anything, the police is involved. C'mon, where's your holiday spirit? Happy Holidays. Monday Evening IDF Memorial Day (For Fallen Soldiers) Can you watch David tomorrow? -He's not in kindergarten? He hurt his head. No, I'm with the old lady tomorrow morning. Where's my underwear? Hey, cousin! Either we don't meet at all or every day. Don't go away, I need you. I can get you a gun. We'll leave tomorrow at six, before the holiday traffic. I went to the police today. They arranged a reconciliation. You're not mad at me because of Arcadia? Of course not. Reconciliation, they said? Tuesday IDF Memorial Day I'm Michael Kleinhaus. -So you brought your kid. How about some ice cream? No? Yes? Cute kid. Want some ice cream? -I wanna go home. -Me too. What about the pomegranates? What pomegranates, Fadi? The ones on the Torah Scroll in Or Yehuda. Okay, okay. Forget about that. This is the guy who scratched my car. What do you do? -Computerize irrigation systems. Hi-tech. That's the future, believe me. Forget what they say. Recession, schmession. Look, we got carried away, how do we put an end to this? How much did it come to? It's in Vadim's Palm. -In The BMW. Then go get it, you dick. You did a good job with that iron rod. You tore my door off. Why would I do that to you? To my wife. Why would I tear her door off? Why do you ask? -I wanna know. She did this to you. She did that and didn't get run over? Don't tick me off, Simcha. -Just kidding. You're telling me someone tore your door off because your wife did that? That has nothing to do with me. Then why did I scratch your car? -That's what I'm asking you. You're paying for that scratch. I don't have so much money. -We're moneylenders too. Now I realize I was wrong to think it was you. That what? -That you'd be offended by a woman doing this to you. Don't do that at the table, don't do that. I'm the only one who can do this here. I quit smoking and don't know what to do with my hands. Can I give you some advice? Between you and me, because I like you. Don't let your wife do this to men on the street. Then you won't have to wander at night around places you're not familiar with... There's nothing wrong with my wife. I'm not afraid of women who do that. You do that to me and I'll tear off your finger, not just your car door, your entire hand So you did tear the door off. I thought you came to apologize. Now instead of educating your wife, you're trying to educate me. Why'd you bring the kid? You thought he'd protect you. Simcha, take the kid for some ice cream. Come on, sweetheart. Vanilla or chocolate? Go with him, kid. Tell him to go. -I'll pay you. Naturally, for the scratch. David, go with him. -We'll go get some ice cream. It's gotta get a little physical. Not in front of the boy. -Your boy, your wife. Everyone's in your way. Won't let you develop where you want to. Go against your instincts. Focus. Think real hard. Get rid of it. Hold on tight. Hold on tight, Daddy-O. What'd you think? That Daddy would give in? Hello? Michael, hi, it's Bentzi Brazil, Brazil Insurance. I can't get hold of your guy. It's okay, I got hold of him. -Really? Daddy, where are we going? To Mommy. Hey, sir... They're behind us. -I know. Come on. Give me your hand. I'm thirsty. Soon. Let's burn it. Stop it. They're gonna kill us. Why do I do all the work while you sit on your ass? Get up! Get up and look for them. You get 'em, I'll hit 'em. Fucker... Let's go wait for him outside his house. We gave him... We'll take it out in the morning... David. I need you. Excuse me. Who's he? -Her husband. They're trying to kill me. I'm in the middle of... -Come on. Always arguing. Or don't you want to come? Just say it. I don't understand what you're telling me. You ran into his door? Dad was going full speed ahead, and then boom, ran into his door. But why did you go see him? -I told you, reconciliation. Wait for me in the lobby. I'll just pop over to the bank. This is what's left of my father. Do you have room service? -Certainly. The kid's hungry. What would you like? A steak. Hotels give me a hard-on. Shouldn't we turn to the police again? I did turn to the police. I did. He wanted 30,000 dollars for the scratch. Now I tore his door off. Our life is me, you and David. Sit and write your story. In the summer we'll go to the beach, we'll have more kids, we'll go somewhere... What do I have aside from you? Look at the sunset. I think I'll write something about passion. That's for Arcadia. "Checkpoint ahead" You said: "Beyond Kfar Saba." This is beyond Kfar Saba. In the Occupied Territories? What's in the boxes? Flags. This is scary. Where did you serve in the army? -Artillery. Anti-tank missiles. Look at him. Must be thinking how lucky we are. Good evening. Please don't drive off the road. Is it still a ways off? Near the grave of Helkiyah the Prophet. Helkiyah the Prophet? Why not? That's it, we're crossing the border. This fabric is as smooth as a rabbit's pussy. Is it synthetic, Abu-Titus? -1 00% cotton. It'll go up in flames, everyone'll be happy. I see your demonstrations on TV, even... Who's the gun for? Abu-David. A writer. I need a gun. Abu-Titus. Mahmoud. -Thank you. What happened to your face? -Women, my man. Women... You're not afraid of God, are you? Of course I am, but with us, the virgins are for now, paradise is here. What's that? What's going on? We get the money. You get the flags. That's Abu-Titus' money. Give me the money. Give him back the money. -They owe me for the antibiotics. We'll pay you when we sell the flags in Nablus. Pay Abu-Titus after Nablus. Stop it! He has two kids in the hospital, with Cancer. They live near the swamp. Industrial area, very dirty... Got anything else to sell? Some holiday... What a bummer. I'm waiting for your book. -I'm not a writer. You're a hero. People don't even have the guts to lose to Dreyfus. Neither do I. Tamar? We see similar events in Arab countries, including "shahid"martyrs, flag burning. Certainly a serious escalation in the Occupied Territories, I wonder how the cabinet will react today... Excuse me. Your wife stepped out, she asked me to keep an eye on him. Where were you? I went to talk to him. -Who? Ben-Moshe. Who asked you to do that? He gave in. -You gave away my father. The money's here. Where are you going? The guy whose door we tore off, now he offended Mommy. I want to sleep with Mommy. Happy Independence Day. Your wife was here. My wife's not a side in this. I gave in to her. You gave in? You felt confident around your people? I'm warning you. I'll drown you, don't mess with me. Don't mess with my wife. How did he get through those guards? I'm telling you, I'm surrounded by idiots. Hey, Fadi, Ehud's waiting for you. Ehud who? The commander. I thought Ehud Ulmert. Don't scare me like that. I thought you might apologize. Some other time, I'm on my way somewhere. Wait, wait a minute. This was the shittiest week I've ever had. Apologize! What's it to you? It'll make you feel better. C'mon, what's it to you? Apologize! Watch out. I'll kill you. Pest. I'm not a pest.
