In a few hours, Mexico will experience the worst hurricane in its history, when a Category 5 hurricane arrives at the coast. A hurricane that is already the strongest ever registered in the Western hemisphere. Out again, Emilia? What did the doctor say? That I'm doing great. I left you a little love message. EMILIA LEFT HER VITAL SIGNS HERE! - Thank you, Gloria. - Can I? Be careful. - - - Julia, I forgot your book! Later? - Fine, beautiful. - Emilia, let's go! - Let's go. What are you doing here? Do you like my "Oliver Twist in the city" look? - Make it sexier. Like this. - Show them. Bitch! - Aren't you going to take these? - Which ones? - The medications! - I already have the ones I need. What else do you need? Can I help you? Can you put these in the backpack? - Let's go. - So now you're hurrying me? Let's go, before your mom gets here. Where are you going? - We'll be back in five minutes. - I promise. - Only five or I'll get in trouble! - Yes! Yes, for sure! Thanks for risking it for me! Who said I was doing this for you? I want to get some sun in this weather! Damn, it's been so long since I've been here. My cousin, Fernanda, is pregnant. - Really? Fernanda? - Yes. It's a surprise. One McFlurry. - Why are we going all the way to Balandra? - It's my favorite beach. There are so many other beaches nearby. There's even one right here. Hi! Violeta, promise me that if I die, you'll erase my Facebook profile. You aren't dying, stupid! I'm serious. I don't want people getting stuff from me when I'm gone. As if it was coming from the other side. Hurry, or I'll leave you here! You're going to sink in the sand, idiot! - Push! - I will! - Come on, keep trying! - It's stuck. Yes! Bitch! Yes! Grab that map from the glove compartment. - What river? We have to cross that? - What if something happens? Oh, please! We should act like in a French porn film! Touch me. Yes! Yes! I love you. Forever. No, only until tomorrow. They have millions, from farming clams! It feels amazing! Thank you, Violeta. Hi, Emilia! Good afternoon. Four states of the Mexican Republic are under the highest alert levels due to the imminent arrival of the hurricane, possibly one of the most dangerous ever seen. Listen to this! A pig's orgasm lasts 30 minutes! Damn! Only a 400-old-year man could be flexible enough to give himself oral pleasure. You got a message from Uno TV: "The Mark storm is going to ravage..." Ravage what? That's what it says. And: "Drummer falls from a window." Good morning. Emilia. Look here. I look like a 50's star, right? They look like I'm about to spank something. Right? - Have you seen this? - Like the king of... Let me see. THE MARK STORM! Were you left speechless? Lift your arms here so the sweat dries out, you are stinky. GREETINGS FROM BALANDRA How many calories are in this thing? What's up, Mr. Eustaquio? Thank you, you too, say "hi" to your family from me. Will it make me fat? Come on, hurry up and pick. Grab the chips. You know what? I will take a six pack. - Can you help me? - Yes? Just one push! It's going to be screwed. Hey, stop it! - Hello! - Hello. - How are you? - Fine, thanks. - Is that the way to La Paz? - I've already told you it is. Why? Are you going alone? - Yes, why? Is it wrong? - I'm just saying. But you could use some company. - But we need a man to protect us, right? - Yes. - Too bad. - Why? I only like women. - Oh. - Right, baby? Are you going to look at us, or charge us? Can't I do both? Or what? Too bad. It's not going through. Can you try again? I haven't used it in a while. Nothing. What do we do? Come closer. Keep the change. We're going to eat over there, keep watching us if you want. You can shop here anytime. Dude! I had money in the car! Did you see, Juan? Learn, dude! Morning, what's up? He tasted salty, like the chips. Is that all? Eighty-five. - Eighty-five. - Watch this. You don't speak Spanish? 85 pesos. Hey, moron! What's your problem? I don't like that! Hey, fucker! - Moron! - Hey, don't hit him! I'm telling you, 85! So you learn your lesson, never touch me like that! 85! - Don't hit him like that! - Stay here. There you go, asshole! Respect me! I said 85! - Let him go! - Asshole! Hurry up, Violeta! Quickly, Violeta! - You motherfucker! - Hurry up! - Hurry up! - Get in, stupid! What are you doing? Get in! Get in the car! - We are in the car! - Hold on! He is going to kill us! Damn, Emilia! - What have you done, Emilia? - What? And this? I'm not going to leave him there so they can beat the crap out of him! - You gave him a bad example! - What? - The cashier! - What about it? If it wasn't for all my bad examples, Emilia, you'd still be at the hospital! - We'll just leave him at the next station! - You tell him then! Come on! We're going to leave you at the next gas station. OK? Is that OK? Get out. Get out. Get out. - No, Emilia, no, no, no. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - No, you shouldn't do that. - - - But did you see how he was? - How was he? He was a total mess. He was super high, right? He's spaced out. I think he's American, something happened to him, and he's lost. American? No, he's just high on something. He scared me. Violeta, they're going to kill him. - Violeta! Turn around, they'll hit him! - I'm coming, I'm coming! What's his problem? No, Emilia. Look at him! We aren't going to beg you either. Are you OK? Why don't you take off your helmet? You'll be more comfortable. May I? It's all right. Are you OK? - He's all beaten up. - I can see that. Dude. Hey! What's your name? Where are you going? Where did you come from? I see you are hurt. Help us, so we can help you. - I don't think he understands. - Something happened to him. Do you speak Italian? I'm not from here. I... I'm from Demara... Over there... We are all many things at the same time. But we are the same energy. Stop bullshitting us. You have to tell me where you're from. Otherwise I'll leave you here on the road. You think it's funny? My job is to study planetary evolution. You are sick because you weren't destined to be born. You're an error within your species. The few techniques of your planet have kept you alive artificially. - You'll disappear soon. - What? Same as everyone else here. Violeta, no. Violeta! - Get out! - Violeta! - Get out! Why shouldn't I kick him out? - Violeta, no! How does he know you're sick? Look, he's right. A disease is a disease. What does that have to do with anything? He could be insane! - He could've killed someone. - He's bruised up. He's drugged up. How does he know you're sick? I'm confused, Emilia! Seriously? If something happens, it's on you. Get in already, I'm about to leave. Get inside. What's your name? It's not... It's not a name like the ones you know. It's... more... It would sound like... - Tinsiduk. - What? Tinsiduk. Really? - That's what they call me. - Your name is... Tinsiduk? Tinsiduk, yes. Your name doesn't work here on Earth. You know? I'm going to change your name, Tinsiduk. I'll call you Mark. Mark? Mark. That's the name of the tropical storm following us. It's behind us. Like you. I like the name Mark. How did you come to this planet? Is your spaceship parked somewhere around? I took over someone's body. Why that body? Why not another one? He's very large. What? His brain was bigger than most. His vibrations were similar to mine. It was an easy transition. What a letdown. Talking about the large one... - how do they do it in your planet? - Stop it. Do it? Sex. - No, no. There's no sex in Demara. - What? Why not? We reached perfect equilibrium... When we transcended, we stopped being born. We also stopped reproducing. That's terrible, Mark. What's wrong with fucking for pleasure? What are you doing? Close the door! Close it! Hey! What are you doing? Where are you going? What are you trying to see? Where are you going? Another idiot! Come on, Emilia, this is bullshit. Let's go. Violeta, he's mentally ill, we can't leave him here! He's probably behind those rocks with eight other dudes. They'll rape us. Wait for me, Emilia! What the hell are you doing? That area is similar to my planet's surface. Yes, that's what we thought. Get down from there. - Get down. - No, you, get down. - You get down. - How did you get up there? Let's go! - Get down. - No, you get down! It's taking too long. Let's get back to the car. That's very dangerous. Please, let's go. Mark, no. What are you doing? Really. Please, don't jump...! - Did he kill himself? - He jumped! Did he kill himself, Emilia? He killed himself, idiot. I told you! What are we going to do now? Balandra! - What the fuck? - Get down from there! Let's go to Balandra. Come down now, or we leave, and I won't give a shit, dude! - Asshole! - How did he make it all the way there? He probably ran, Violeta! For fuck's sake! So if no one fucks in your planet, no one falls in love either? Are you going to start again? In the entire universe, a human being is one of the few smart species that experiences that. It's a fascinating phenomenon. It's also the culprit of humanity's exponential growth. So then, the answer is no? Then, the answer is no. For the good of the universe, men and their primitive emotions must disappear. That's why I'm here. Emilia also doesn't believe in sex or in love. Maybe she's from your planet. Stupid. Why don't you talk instead? Are you getting nauseated? - Should I stop? - No. - I'll stop at a hotel, so you can rest. - Yes. - Can I... can I help you with something? - No, no. - Just give me some time. - Say the word, and we'll head back. Let me see. I like this species. It's surprising how slow it moves. It's dead, Mark. Careful. Are they a couple? Yes. Why are they together? They are already infertile and their bodies are starting to decay. It's not practical. That's love, Mark. That's the phenomenon that according to you will make humanity disappear. 35 thousand orbits around the sun... made us realize that the expectations we had for your species were too high. That's why we decided to make it disappear. At 22.8 degrees, North latitude, 109.9 degrees, West latitude, the mechanism of extinction will be activated. Exactly in... 2496 minutes. After that, I'll be picked up by my own kind. Your body is also in decline. Shall we get in the water? In Baja California Sur, the hurricane's arrival is imminent, - and it's now a category 3. - Mark. Federal authorities have said that starting today, there will be updates every three hours regarding the hurricane's trajectory. HURRICANE MARK WILL TOUCH LAND IN TWO DAYS It helps with nausea. It tastes like music. - Like music? - Yes. It smells yellow. You can smell colors... - and taste music? - Yes. Did you think that synesthesia was only a human thing? No. I love her a lot. She's always been with me. Always, ever since we moved here. In fact, when I was diagnosed, she was the only one that kept visiting me. She convinced me not to shave my head, so I could keep hooking up. That bitch was worrying more about my horniness than my death. - Death is for those that stay behind. - No one is staying behind. I like your trip, you're all over the place. Do you have more of that stuff for nausea? Yes, I have more of it. - Rock, paper, scissors! - Rock, paper, scissors! I'll get you some water. The party is over. Good night. Let's go to bed. Oh, no, no! You aren't sleeping there. You're sleeping in the car. You like him. No way, Violeta. I thought I was the one that liked the crazy ones. He says he's here to destroy Earth. Where did he go now? Maybe back to his planet. - Mark! - I'll help you find him. - What is he doing now? - "E.T. phone home." - You think? - Could be. Get out! It's not funny anymore, Mark! - You're an idiot, we thought you drowned! - What's up? What do you think you're doing? Water is an excellent interdimensional conductor. I don't give a shit about your little trips. Don't hurt her. You hear me? Don't pretend you aren't getting it, you know exactly what I'm talking about. We have to go now. There isn't much time left. Less than 2160 minutes. Are you OK? It's almost as if it was the first time you saw a horse. It's the first time I see a horse. Why is he locked up? - Would he run away? - I guess so. I think so too. I love that you act like it's the first time you've seen things. I don't understand. Well, tell me something in your own language then. What did you say? Something. - You said something? - Yes. Tell me something else. - What did that mean? - That you smell nice. But I smell like vomit. In Demara, we have a color that smells like that. - Vomit color? - Yes, sometimes the sky turns that color. When Vela aligns with Demara, the atmosphere changes like that. - Vomit-colored sky. - Yes. Your planet sounds nice. What did I say? Are you smoking again? Let's go! Didn't we fill out the paperwork together so you'd go to college? Honestly, I didn't send it. Why didn't you send it? Because I don't think I'll have time. With all the things you're doing, right? You're so busy. I'm sure you spend your time reading magazines. Bitch, as if you knew everything going on in my life. Don't talk to me like that, bitch. Just stay quiet. Because you end all arguments with silence. Silence says it all, right? Good. Why do you love making me feel like this? - Me? - You love to stab, stab, and jab me until you find my soft spot. Sure. Because you're always the victim, right? Because nothing ever happens to me. Because I can never feel bad, right? You can be sad as much as you want, you decide not to be, because poor me. - And you always have to be happy. - But you always act like the victim, dude. That's how I feel all the time. You are the one always acting like a clown. Why did we stop here? - Because Violeta got lost again. - Quit it, we'll just look at the map. - You had to turn on the one, stupid. - Stop it, don't talk to me like that. What happened to you? Her body showed signs of a malfunction. - I'm OK. - You still have time. Dude. That's enough. You're not pulling one on me. Look at you! This is getting out of hand. Let's go camp at the beach. You think I'm an idiot? You think I wouldn't notice that you didn't bring your medications? That you're coughing a lot, and bleeding from your nose? And now this? I'm fine, I'm fine. - This isn't a game. - I'm not playing. Do you want to leave? No way! It has to be in the mouth, to really make up for it. I would love it if Mark was real. What do you mean? A normal guy, not an insane guy. No one is normal. What is he doing? What's he doing? Yes. This element doesn't work, but it's fixed. What's up? Are we still far from Balandra? Hello! A little bit of shadow. Can you put it on? Is that your boyfriend? The guy by the motorcycle? - Him? - Yes. He's not my boyfriend. - No? - No. No, he's just a guy that... needed a lift, that's all. My bud. - Hello. - Hey. We came from San Diego. I wanted to come to Baja, and I decided to bring him. I see. How do you like it so far? We weren't lucky. Why, what happened? Mark. You know him too? The storm. I'm so dumb! It's in the news. I know what you're talking about, but I got confused. They say it'll destroy everything. - Hey. - Hey. You can take a beer. Let me get dressed. HURRICANE MARK WILL TOUCH LAND IN A DAY - So what then? - About what? - Are you going to Balandra? - Yes. No, don't go. Why not? - The hurricane is going that way. - The hurricane, please. They always say that, but it never happens. - What? - Who knows? Are you sure you know how to use that? Where's he going? Your star is special. - The sun? - Yes. In Demara, they always tell us that... our sunsets are the second most beautiful in the universe. After Earth? I guess so. Well, this will be the last sunset for humanity, right? Are you having any feelings about that? You could come to Demara. Thank you for inviting me. But even if you convinced all Demarians, and they'd let me go to their planet, and not make humanity go extinct, I don't have much time left. Why can't they fix you? I don't know. They tried. But my heart's not working. It's like a bad joke, right? Have you heard of Eki? No, what's that? It's a planet I visited in one of my trips. There is no past or present there. It's always the present. It's always the here. Ekrians think that past and future... are mental creations, in which we get lost, like in a maze. But the present... is real. It's eternal. And... I feel, today, that, here, with Emilia, one of the most unique beings that I've met in my voyages, I feel Ekrian. You are so crazy. You also read the future? Look at that. What does that one say? Does it say if I'm going to kiss you? No. But this one says we'll see. I like you, Mark. Yes? Close your eyes. And now imagine... for a moment... that you're not an alien. Mark. Close your eyes. Imagine you're a person. Like the rest of us. A human. Close your eyes. You are a human, OK? Give me a real kiss. That is humanity's secret weapon. You are going to visit me in Tijuana, right? Hey! What's up dude? Your friend. Tell him to leave. Relax. He's not going to do anything. He's looking at me. Tell him to leave. This is his house, let him. Come on. I don't like this. What? - You didn't tell me this was his. - It's fine, stay. Come here. What are you doing? - Come here. - No! You are an idiot. Let me go! Come. Where are you going? Get out of my way. Stupid girl, dude. - Did she leave? - She's right there, dude. Stupid fatty, don't scare people away. Damn, what an ass you just had. - Fuck! - You wanted some of that? So what then? Aren't you going to give me your number? We are just going for beers, and we'll be right back. And your friend? You left me alone! - But you were with them. - Yes, I was, but it's done! - What happened? - It's been three hours! Nothing! Are you OK? - Oh my God! Let's get out of here! - Mark! Come on! Come on! - Run! - Get in! - Get in, hurry up! - Hurry! - Are you OK? - I'm fine, I'm fine. Nothing fell on you? Are you OK? I'm thinking that maybe I should join your sect. Blowing up the world isn't that bad of an idea. It's full of assholes. I think that... despite human's capacity for destruction, they also have some extraordinary characteristics. The contact that I had with Emilia a few hours ago was... a fascinating experience. What? What happened? Did you guys fuck? We exchanged fluids, and had a vibratory connection. You needed that. A fluid exchange. That's good news. And you? Weren't you an asexual alien not that long ago? All the men in the universe are the same. So now what? You see your first girl in the Earth, and now you love humanity, and want to save the world? What happened to our plan? Weren't we supposed to blow up the world? HURRICANE MARK WILL TOUCH LAND IN THEN HOURS Thank you. For whatever it is that you did yesterday... Thank you. Morning. How are you? How am I? A little bit lost because of what happened yesterday. You left me alone. Start getting used to it. Why do you always say things like that? Can't you realize that you're hurting me? Hurting others? A Category 3 hurricane. It will practically go through the entire peninsula. The authorities have installed the National Emergency Committee at the National Center for the Prevention of Disasters, which will work to prevent the... And in its path, the peninsula of Baja California Sur, and the federal authorities have warned the public with the highest alert level. Evacuations have started for people living in... - And now? - Fuck, we're almost there. Good afternoon. - Where are you heading? - Balandra. That area is being evacuated, you need to go back. - Did you hear that? We have to go back. - But we're already there! - Of course we are, look at the storm! - No, we can... Wait! Wait, hold on! - Where are you going? - Just go! Why are you doing this? I'm tired of it always being about you! - Open the door! - Go home! What's wrong with you now? Your nose is bleeding. What do you think, Violeta? I'm not all right. - Stop saying stupid shit! - I'm a mess inside! You told me the doctor said you were fine when we left. I lied. I've already decided. - Really? Why? - Yes. Because all I have left is being able to decide where the fuck I'll die. Do you even care that there are people around you? We also have feelings! The only thing you think about is in your fucking disease and dying! I don't believe you're dying. But if you want to die, you'll die alone! They could heal you in Demara. Are you OK, miss? Don't worry, I'll get an ambulance. The shelters closest to your community. All ports in Baja California will be closed. In other news, the famous sci-fi writer, Gerónimo García, is still missing after the presentation of his newest novel, Camino a Marte. These are the latest images of the author, during an interview in San Diego with the literary critic Joseph Robson. Close ones confirmed that he was last seen crossing the border towards Tijuana... - Something happened, right? - In his motorcycle. The writer, Gerónimo García, has gotten recognition due to... Where is she? - ...his works in science fiction. In the last few years, his books have been printed in over 15 languages, and have sold millions of copies... and they hope to have news of his whereabouts soon. The police has continued the search... Yes? Do you know Gerónimo García? Does he remind you of someone? You are Gerónimo García. 165 minutes. - 164 minutes. - Hey. Calm down. Everything will be all right. Have you seen Emilia? What surprises me the most about your species is everything they have to see to believe. How are you feeling? Amazing. You look amazing. Where's Mark? I think that... Hi. Are you with her? Can we talk? I'll be right back. It'll be quick. Are you a relative? We are friends. We were traveling together. If she already knew, why the hell did she leave the hospital? She's not healthy enough to travel. She should be admitted. She's very ill. Do her parents know that she's traveling? No? You didn't think that her disease would get worse? I don't know. I don't know if we did the right thing or not. I don't understand. Why? How long has it been since she took her medicines? Who would want to die here? With tubes all over the place? That's not your decision to make. It isn't yours. It was her own choice. And that's all I care about. Hey, please! Check on the patients and monitors! Turn on the emergency lights, please.
