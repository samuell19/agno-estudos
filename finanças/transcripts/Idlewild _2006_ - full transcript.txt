Percival: All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances, all with a specific role to play. Even at a funeral. I was searching for my role in life. You get one shot. Can't go back and change anything. Strange, all these people showing up to see a dead guy. Folks from small towns are always up for a show. Even at a funeral. I know because I spent most of my life in this very room. Different faces, but always the same characters. Some full of regret, feeling trapped, in need of something outside this small town. That was the day me and rooster met. It was the first time rooster had ever seen a real dead guy, and the first time I'd ever touched one. Touched one... Of course rooster put me up to it. It was his uncle Eddie's funeral. He was like a father to rooster. He was a classy gangster. And so was his partner, spats. Son, this was your uncle's. Don't never lose it. I won't. Flask: How you doing? Are you ready? We about to have a ball. I'm your best friend. Percival: They were high rollers with fast cash... Go on, take a whiff. Don't be shy. And faster ladies. Stinky. And, man, talk about the ladies. Talk about the ladies. Man, talk about the ladies. See? Pink satin, just like I told you. You owe me five cents. Pay up. Them some sexy drawers! Percival: My father said rooster was trouble, and didn't want me playing with him or anybody else, for that matter. I pretty much lived my life inside, except for the days I visited my mother. My auntie belle made me keep up with my lessons. Percival. Pay attention, percival. It's right in front of you. B flat. Robber: Hey, baby. Stop! Police! Freeze! Come and get me, copper. Whoo! Percival: Piano was my thing. Rooster preferred singing and gambling. Praise Jesus. Today is my lucky day, fellows. Y'all owe me some money. Pay up. Collect my money, if you know what I mean. Percival: But my auntie belle didn't approve. Let's get out of here! That didn't matter much to rooster. He never listened to anybody anyway. Eventually, my father started preparing me to take over the family business. Percy: Thing is, make the deceased look like they're at peace. Go on. Go on. Go. Peaceful. Not happy. Percival: I learned my family business, and rooster learned his. Seventy-five bottles this month. Bootlegging. That's $48. $46.50. Seventy-five bottles at 62 cents each is... $46.50. Boy's too smart for his own britches. Spats: Good looking out, man. How the hell am I going to make it to biloxi by sundown? I got an idea. Rooster: We can hide the bottles in here. Ohl shit. Think he heard us? I don't know. Let's go check it out. Come on. He'll be awake by 8:00. Percival: We were from two totally different sides of the track, with one common ground... You got to get it back by 8:00. I'll have it back. I promise. Percival: Music. Here. God don't make no mistakes. Ain't nothing slick to a can of oil. Percival: The records got old. So did me and rooster. Photographer: All right, now that's perfect. Okay, now. Give me a big smile. One, two... One more time. And cheese. That's perfect. Man, rooster. You got a big family now. Come on, rooster, you can smile better than that. Ain't y'all pretty? Man, take the picture. One, two... cheese. Percival: Rooster had to take care of his family, and I had to take care of mine. 10:00 A.M. damn shame. One, two, three. Ain't y'all finished yet? Percival: By day, I helped my father work in the mortuary. Percy: Get that carnation right, now. Yes, sir. But by night, rooster got me a part-time gig playing at a local juke joint where he worked, church. That's what we called the place, but it was anything but that. Taffy: How y'all feelin' tonight? Man: Depends on what you're doing. I don't give a damn. Man 2: I'd be your bra right now! Man 3: She ain't nothing. Yo, yo, fix me another drink. Renee, take your brother. Well, hush. Zora: I'm fed up with this, rooster. And it's starting to take a toll on me and the kids. And we ain't just gonna sit at home while you romp around every night in this... Cover them ears. Whorehouse. Zora, for the last time, this is a respectable business, and I make good money. Now, you know I got responsibilities. Responsibilities? That's bullshit. When was the last time you been to a real church, rooster? You can't even remember, huh? It's been so long. I got... you need the spirit in your life. You need to start spending some time with the kids. Tell you what. Why don't I take you shopping in the morning? You and the kids. Would you like that? Barbecue. That is barbecue right there. Taffy: What the hell you looking at? I wish you'd get that song right. Always drunk. I should set her ass on fire. Girl, now what you mad at? You did good. Percival: That's monk. He works backstage, but no one knows what he does besides borrow money. Taffy, you sho' nuff gorgeous. Love the hair. Loan me a nickel note, dime note, two cents, whatever. Go on, monk. You still owe me from last week. You better pay me. And that's Ace. Ace owns church. He liked to be called sunshine Ace, but most folks just called him Ace. Goddamn rooster! Unless they wanted something. Sunshine Ace! Just the man I'm looking for. Listen to me, you son of a big jackass, you ain't gonna get nothing from me but the what for. The what for? Yeah, when I put my foot in your ass, you gonna say, "what for? What for?" Now move. You're $85 in the hole! Come on, sawed-off. All: Rooster! Rooster! Man: Come on, man. Director: Man, I hope they don't start throwing bottles again. Holy moly! Rooster's late again. Y'all jackasses, play something quick. Like what? He ain't even here yet, man. I don't care what you play. All I know is I got a house full of angry people, and ain't none of these niggers getting their money back. All right, baby blue, you're on, man. Jackass! One, two, three, four. Percival: Suddenly, I was forced into the hot seal. I hated the spotlight. It always gave me the jitters. Man 1: Somebody owe us something. Man 2: Now I done paid my damn money! Music note: I told you to bring the good songs. You better come harder than that, sweetie! This ain't no mortuary! Man: Keep your hand on the keys, man. Music note: Now, y'all gonna throw up. Look at the keys. Jackass gonna get my club torn to pieces. Hi, daddy. Hey. Security! Rooster: Kids, y'all be good tonight. Mind your mother. You want to go shopping tomorrow? Kids: Yes. Okay. Go on and give me a kiss. Girl 1: Bye, daddy. Girl 2: Bye, daddy. Muah. Love you. How's my tie? Perfect. I'll see you in the morning. Zora: I'll be glad when the police come and bust this place up, rooster. And don't you come calling me to bail you out. Girl, bye. Here comes the family man. Shit. Family man? More like bow tie pimp. Late again, as usual. Man: Keep them hands on the goddamn... Oh, hell, man. He's going to throw up again? Ohl woman: I'm in herel no, oh, man. No. Oh. Watch out, ladies. He gonna blow. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, give it up for the amazing rooster! Evening, ladies. Hey. Sho' nuff looking right tonight. Thanks. Just gotta do one thing. What's that, baby? Don't show so much so soon. You got to give a man something to dream about. That's right. Okay, rooster. Okay, my ass. Bye, daddy. Rooster. Ain't he fine? Flask: Riding so smooth, baby. Oh, smooth as a baby's bottom is. No, he didn't. That's disgusting! Thanks for holding it down for me, boy. No problem. Monk: In the groove. Too smooth. Don't you mess with me. Showtime.

Gorgeous dress. Thanks for noticing, sweetie. Ace: Hey, uh... Why don't you go, uh, chase a couple of drinks while me and the boys chew the fat? Sure, daddy. Anything for you, rooster. Taste like chitlins. Looking dapper as ever. How you been, spats? Never bad, son. Never bad. Got you a little present. And I appreciate this already. Ace: Hey, trumpy! I guess they let anybody into the church. Ace. Oh, you taught him how to speak. Nice. But the name is sunshine Ace, nigger. Business look good. I'm impressed. We got the prettiest girls for more than 100 square miles. We're selling more hot sauce than anybody this side of the Mason-Dixon. Ain't that right, sweetheart? It's been like that for the past three months, every night. This shit here sells like canned pussy. I bet you thought I was gonna say "hotcakes," didn't you? Bravo, bravo! Baby blue, you have done it again. Monk, not right now. You scared all the women away from me. Honey bun and China! Don't you know I've been working on them two broads for three weeks? And you go and heave right in front of them, and blew the whole night. "I don't know, monk. He kind of strange." "No, girls, you got him all wrong. "He's a little incentric. "Classy!" oh. You're a sad case, man. Maybe you right. The word is "eccentric." I know the word. What make you think I want any of one of these floozies? Don't you want somebody worth having? Ain't nobody talking about getting hitched! I just wanna have a good time. I know one thing for sure, Percy. Better get on one of these old girls, 'cause nothing will just drop out the sky! Damn fool. Two. Mmm. Three. That's what I'm talking about. Man: Lord. Monk: Good gracious. Lord, lord, lord. Mmm! Fellows, would you look at that there? Have you ever... Gentlemen. Mmm. Good lord god almighty. You look like the man I'm here to see. No, I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm just a piano player. Well, listen, piano player, I just traveled 19 hours from St. Louis in a coach seat, and angel Davenport don't ride coach. Angel Davenport? The angel Davenport? In the flesh, honey. May I make your acquaintance? Monk s. Dubois. The "s" stands for sherman. What brings you to town, spats? I wanted you both to hear it from me. I'm getting out the business. Come on, man. What's the play, man? This ain't no play, Ace. I'm tired. If I don't get out now, I never will. Business is doing so good, I can retire, give everybody a piece of the rock. For the right price. Good lord, girl, you finer than all outdoors! Shit, girl, you... you a star! Of course we weren't expecting you till next week. Well, my show in St. Louis finally came to an end. Three months of back-to-back shows in that city would wear anybody out. Now I told my agent, Nathan, I needed a change of scenery. He said, "why not head on down to idlewild early?" Thought I'd come and see what the big fuss in idlewild, Georgia, is all about. I must admit, so far I'm not impressed. Twenty-five thousand? Plus the $1,250 you owe me from the last shipment. That's a heavy load, spats. Twenty-five large buy you a direct line to my supplier and my entire clientele. Now, if I can't find me a buyer, then I gotta turn my operation over to someone I can trust, in which case, I become a stockholder and collect my dividends. You always been good with numbers, rooster. How about it? Hmm. Know what? Maybe you right, spats. I am good with numbers. I'm going to mull that over. Ace: Like hell you will! I've got your 25 large. And I got a big plan that's going to bring more people in here than ever. So, if you allow me, I'd like to make a toast to you. To fast women, fast money, and new beginnings. The hell with that. To 25 large. Where is this Mr. sunshine Ace? He sent me a coach ticket. That was not part of our agreement. A lady has standards to maintain, you know. Well, I'm sure that it... it says right here in the telegram, "first class." Don't say nothing about no coach. What does it say? Uh, first class. That's right. First class. Right there in bold writing. So how the hell did I get coach? Well, look at miss goody two-shoes. She look better in the pictures, if you ask me. Excuse me. Do I know you? Hell, no. But if you fix yourself up a little... Taffy! Miss angel Davenport. Lord. Don't try it, man. I just traveled 19 hours on a stinking train from St. Louis in a lousy coach seat. I deeply regret that. Some jackass didn't follow my orders! I did exactly what you... But now that you're here, sunshine Ace will take real good care of you. Just as soon as we take care of the legal paperwork. Now, I just so happen to have your contract. Them just the details. Sign by the "x." Give me a pen. Here. Right there. Yup. Now that the legal stuff is out the way, you can have anything you want. Anything? Anything. Just you name it. Hmm. Mmm. White carnations. White carnations! You heard the lady. Got you. And my own dressing room. Ace: And her own dressing room. Taffy, come here. The rest of you niggers, get back to work. Come on, sawed-off. Monk: Follow me, miss Davenport. Ladies! Monk: Look at this shit. I don't even like you, girl. Get your ass up out of here! Monk? You know, we can do this another time. Get your stinky ass up out of here. You too. What... no, stop! You didn't even want to loan me no money? Get your ass out, too. What the hell is this, huh? What the hell is this? I'm sorry, just... right after you, miss Davenport. Thank you, monk. You welcome. Angel: Bye, monk. Bye. Oh, rooster. Baby, why you make me act so bad? Who, me? Yes, you. Oh, you bad boy. Guess I kind of inherited it from my uncle Eddie. Got a weakness for fine women such as yourself. Ooh. And that perfume don't help, either. One second. One second. Mmm-mmm-mmm. Bad boy. Ah! Let's head over to the garage. Hey, Ace. Excuse me, man. I want to, uh... what? I want to talk to you about the piano. Some of the notes are still sticking, and I... Don't you touch that damn piano. That piano is a bona fide antique. Jelly roll Morton brought the house down with that piano! If it's good enough for jelly roll, it's good enough for a mortician nigger like yourself. It just needs a little tuning. I mean, I hit a couple of bad notes, but... Let me tell you something. The only reason why you even here, because rooster said, "please, "please let my mortician friend come play the piano at your club." That's the only reason why you here. Watch your conduct, nigger! Jackass! Ace: I still got girls! Women: Bye, Percy! Idiot. Hmm. Never heard of this one before. No one has. So you play piano and write songs. Yeah, I play a little bit, just to pass the time. That's a creepy car. Yeah, I wouldn't want to be caught dead in that one. That's funny. You're cute, piano player. Thank you. You got a name? Percival. Percival Jenkins. Well, see you around, percival Jenkins. Hey, percival. Why don't you take that phony broad back to the mortuary? Taffy: Maybe you'll get you some! Let me ask you something. Ooh, baby. Why are all the good ones taken? Shit! Goddamn! Oh! The big man. Here, take this out of here. What he doing here? Get my panties. Where you going? Watch yourself, spats. Yeah, yeah. Come on, man. Rose: Get my panties. Ace: Yeah. You know, I got big plans shaking from out them trees out there. That's the only way today's negro going to make it in today's society. It's like something my mama used to tell me, well, not my birth mama, but the lady that raised me. Bitch, what you doing in here? I just wanted to finish up the receipts so... So me and you could spend some quality time together tonight, daddy. Receipts. Right. Right. I'll tell you what. You go upstairs, keep the bed warm for me. Take this with you. I didn't know you was gonna bring company. See you later, fellows. Lord, lord, lord, lord. Pussy and money. If god created anything better, he kept it to himself. Amen. I've been waiting on this day, spats. Oh, I've been dreaming about it. I didn't know it was gonna come so soon, but I ain't about to let you talk me out of it. A big man's got to have big plans. And this is my big plan. In a year's time, I can run for mayor of this goddamn town. Hell, I just might. The way I see things, you work for me now. You get your greasy-ass hands off of me. Relax, son. He ain't mean nothing by it. I'm not going to tell you again. Say, slick, what's your fucking problem? You talking to sunshine Ace. Watch your conduct around me, nigger. Trumpy: Nigger, I don't give a damn who you are. I would never work for some stinking, fat, whore-loving trick like you. Now, get the fuck... Spats. Spats. You know I'm not trying to disrespect your business, spats, and I don't believe in violence, but I will cut this motherfucker! Watch your conduct! Put it away, trumpy. Put it away, trumpy. You, too, Ace. No, don't worry, spats. Sunshine Ace ain't cutting nobody today. Trembling like a little bitch. I told you to put it away, trumpy. We're here on business. Ace: Trumpy. Son, you beginning to forget your place. Ace: Spats, come get this half-breed. Do you hear me, trumpy? Yeah, I hear you. Ace: Nigger, you crazy. And the problem is, I've heard you loud and clear for six years. Six long years I've been out there busting my goddamn conk for you to keep your hands clean. And why? So a piece of shit like this can get rich? Put the damn gun down now, trumpy. What? This slimy pig mean something to you? You really are senile, old man. Ace: You're talking to spats. Boy, you about to get your ass whipped. You done lost your natural mind. Ace: That's right, spats. No, it's quite the opposite, sir. That's right. You see, I've watched you for a long time, spats. And you taught me that when opportunity knocks, you said the smart man answers. A. Ce: Spats! Spats! Son! I see, that was some really good advice. Trumpy. Hey, what was that that you told me? Trumpy. Trumpy. No, trumpy. What was it? Was it, like, never... I'm gonna put the knife down, trumpy. Will you shut the fuck up for a second? I'm trying to think. Never... I'm going to put the knife down, trumpy. Oh, oh. Oh, I got it. Never bring a knife to a gunfight, mother... Whoo! A fool and his money... So this your big plan, huh? Angel Davenport? A singer? Hey, fat man, where is the money? Let's see. Fuck you, trumpy. Shit. The fear of clocks the fear of time How's the cost of living? Ain't got much time left [I've got to funk you now I take what I've been given ain't got much time left [I've got to funk you now pastor say, "be strong” ain't got much time left [I've got to funk you now [ ain't got time leave me alone ain't got much time left [I've got to funk you now y'all know what I'm talking about chronomentrophobia chronomentrophobia chronomentrophobia chronomentrophobia chronomentrophobia chronomentrophobia Percival: Morning. No! Go on. Going on, now. What you hitting me for? You ain't got no business being out all hours of the night. That's the devil's hour. Here we go. Zora, don't start. I had a rough night last night. Know what? It's Saturday. Remember you said you was gonna take me and the kids downtown? That's just what you gonna do. Now get your lying, cheating ass up out this bed. Come on! Give me the damn cover. I ain't going nowhere. Looks like it was over money. Probably. That was nice, wasn't it? Come on. Come on, now. Look at all them pretty ladies right there. Zora: You ain't off the hook yet. Let me help you with that, my friend. What you doing here, trumpy? Driving by. Noticed you was out doing the little family thing. Thought it'd be rude if 1 didn't stop by and say hello. What do you want with me? Last night, old man spats and Ace got into a little scuffle. Tragic. See, the way I figure, you are naturally next in line to run church, seeing as how you was Ace's flunky and all. And since you naturally inherit the club, you also naturally inherit its debt. So? Well, Ace was a month behind in paying spats. So you now owe me $1,250. Now, who told you you was in charge? Who's going to tell me I'm not? I mean, you're a smart man. Zora: Hands. You got a lot to lose. Afternoon, zora. Mighty nice hat. Here's $150. That's all I got. $1,100 short. And, by the way, the price of hooch just went up to $2 a bottle. $2 a bottle? That's double the price. Inflation. Ain't you heard? I mean, times are hard everywhere. Yeah, well, I ain't coming on that tab. You know, funny thing. Settle down. I tripped over these last night. Seen Rose lately? Don't get any bright ideas. Zora: What was that all about? Rooster: Spats got gunned down last night. Him, Ace, both of them stretched out. Zora: Oh, my god. What you gonna do? Pull over right here. I need to take care of something. Rooster, wait. Do you remember how it used to be in the beginning, me and you? Before we was married. When you took me out to that peach orchard? We said we was gonna get us our own orchard one day. Grow us some peaches. Raise us some kids. And look at you. You're so smart. You could make a business doing anything. We could get out of town right now. Take our babies and start over and start it right. Zora, I just need for you to trust me. Just until I sort things out. That's all. Be careful. Everything will be okay. Percy: Percival. Percival. Percival, will you stop banging on that piano and get down here? Percival. Percival. We got two bodies down here. Busy day. Come on. Put him over there. Yeah. Percival: Afternoon, fellows. Mr. fat man. Finally got stretched out, huh? Ooh, they got you good. They weren't playing, were they? But it serves you well. You shouldn't have been trying to put me on the spot and embarrass me. I am that mortician nigger. But you know what that means? That means that before you leave this place, you have to come see me. So now who's the jackass? What? Man, I ought to wash your mouth out with soap. Does your mother know you talk like that? I didn't think so. Guess it don't matter too much now. But you can tell me how in the hell am I going to get your fat ass in this casket? You think this is play time? No, sir. You gotta learn to have more respect for the dead. Take your job more seriously. Where's your pride? Your pride is in your work. I apologize. I don't want your apologies. Just do your job. Now get this man cleaned up. And stop playing. Business is business. Jackass. Hello? Rose. Hey, hey, Rose. It's me, rooster. I see who you is. What you doing here, man? Put the goddamn frying pan down. I ain't putting shit down till you tell me why you here. Is you trying to kill me, rooster? Hell, no. Now put the goddamn frying pan down. It's me. It's rooster, baby. Boo! Hi, piano player. Hi. So you really do work with dead people. Now that would give me the creeps. You get used to it after a while. Doesn't bother me naught. What are you doing here? Well, I'm doing a little investigating. There's a rumor that sunshine Ace got stretched out last night. Guess you heard, huh? What you look at me like that for? I ain't buying nobody's horseshit story they shot each other. Since I'm the only one that can pin trumpy to that damn garage, it ain't going to be too long before he after me. So I'm getting out of here, and there ain't nothing you can do to stop me. I ain't come to stop you. I came to say goodbye. Damn, rooster. As soon as I get myself caught in the middle of some shit, you just gonna up and leave me like that? It's gotta be different now. Oh, now it's gotta be different. You know it's gotta be different. Just my luck. So is he here? Okay, okay. Cover him up. Damn. Just my luck. Dead as a doorknob. Now what am I going to do? I'm stuck in this cow town and it's gonna cost me $107 for a ticket out of here. You owe me $107, fat man! Did you check his pocket? Oh, I know you ain't gonna skip out without paying my goddamn rent. Don't talk that jive to him, you old battle-ax. Rose, I'm really sorry about everything. Don't you say that to me. Don't you ever say that to me. Well, hey, maybe you should talk to rooster. I think he's going to be running the club from now on, and he may have something for you. Thanks for your help. I'll see you around, percival. Trumpy: Well, well. What happened? I followed rooster over to this spot over there on... Bobo: Come on. Come on, Sonny. Spit it out. Baker Street. Baker? It was Rose's place. Rose's place. See, I told you that fool was going to lead us right to her. He sure did, trumpy. Trumpy: And? And then she got into a cab with all kind of... Bobo: Come on. Spit it out. Luggage and shit. Where the hell did she go? I... I don't know where she went. But I followed rooster back here. You must have a peanut for a brain. Bobo: Mmm-hmm. I specifically remember telling you to follow Rose. Bobo: Follow Rose. I ain't need you to follow rooster. Not rooster. What am I going to do with you? Let me see your gun, Sonny. Bobo: Come on, Sonny. Give him the gun. Thank you. Spats once told me... He said in every relationship, the person least interested in maintaining the relationship is going to dominate, because they won't compromise. See, Sonny... no compromise. In this relationship right here, uh... I can't afford to compromise. Bobo: Now take it like a man. Stand still. Take it like a man, Sonny. Come on. Pissed him off now. Percival: All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances, all with a specific role to play. Even at a funeral. Sometimes in a show, a lead actor's contract expires. When that happens, an understudy has to step in and perform, whether he's ready or not. Sorry about what happened with spats, man. Sure going to miss him. Yeah, me, too. Now I got to run the club, pay everybody and sing on top of that. You'll figure it out. You always do. I don't know. If I don't get killed first, zora gonna leave me for real this time. Percival: She always says that. You know she ain't going nowhere. Trumpy raising the price of hooch. He's sucking up all the profit. I ain't making a dime. No, it's all right. What if you go around trumpy? Like you always tell me, can't find a way, make one. I need a favor. Yeah. I need to borrow the hearse. Bring it back by 8:00. God don't make no mistakes. You ain't said nothing slick to a can of oil. Meet you at the house. Ain't life a bitch? How you holding up, rooster?

May I have a word with you? Thank you. As you may or may not know, Ace and I had a contract. And if you take a close look at this contract, you are obliged to provide me one first class ticket to my next destination, which is St. Louis, Missouri. Mmm-hmm. And seeing as how you're now the manager of this establishment, the responsibility of honoring this contract falls upon you. You know, it don't make no difference if Ace is dead or not. Says so right there in the fine print. Let me see that. I'll have you know that's a legally-binding obligation signed by both parties. You know what? You're right. It obliges you to sing. And it's your first week. You... you still want me to sing? You ain't got no choice. It says so right here at the top. "Club owner hereby engages artist for a period of four weeks." In fine print. As you pointed out, this is a legally-binding obligation. Yeah. Well, of course it'll take me a little while to prepare. Don't worry about that. You on tomorrow night, sugar. Tomorrow? Tomorrow night, you on. Tomorrow? 9:00 sharp. Why, I need at least a week to get my band together. Oh, sugar, you look so good. Rooster, please, have a heart. I'm not ready. Come on. Don't be late.

You trying to pinch me? Pinch you? If you recollect, on the night of their unfortunate demise, old man spats had a deal with Ace for twenty-five large. That was Ace's deal. I'm square.

Keep your ass away from my husband. Rooster: I can take it from here, ladies. Y'all done a good deed tonight, and the lord sho' nuff gonna bless you in due time. Now, excuse me while I tend to my wife. How the hell I keep getting myself into this? There goes my ticket out of here. Zora, I know. But it ain't what it look like. You must think I'm some kind of damn fool. Well, I'm fed up. I know that. Zora: I've half a mind to come over there and smash her right in the face. Women: Dishrag! Woman 1: Come on, girl, let's go. Woman 1: You got any reefers on you? Woman 2: Girl... I know so, heffa. What you need... did you see his hand come up? Angel: Hey, percival. Hey, angel. Huh? Wow. I didn't realize it was getting so late. I'm glad you came. Yeah. You got a lot of records. Yeah, I've been collecting since I was eight. Rooster got me started. I love this one. Cab Cal? That's one of my favorites. That is one hep cat. Hair always fried. Hmm. Hmm. Wearing the sharpest vines in the city. One day he's gonna come to idlewild, and I'm gonna play for him. Angel: You knew. You knew all along, didn't you? You must think I'm some kind of fool, huh? No, no. No. That's great. Angel, you got it all wrong. I can explain. Percival: Shit. Zora, wait! I was gonna have that cleaned. I can explain! I'm listening. Okay, it's hard to explain. Wait! Look. Hey. I know we've been through a lot. And I ain't perfect, but I swear to you, I'm a changed man. You asked me to trust you, rooster. And that's exactly what I did. And look at what I got in return. I can't do this no more. It's time for me to start thinking about me and the kids. You keep messing around at that club, and you're gonna get yourself laid out. And we don't want to be around to see that. Y'all say goodbye to your daddy. I don't want to go, daddy. Eula Mae, y'all go on with your mama. You'll be all right. Come on, babe. Come on. So where y'all going? Over to my mama's. I'll just meet y'all over there when I get settled. Well, I pray they don't send you over in a box. Take care, rooster. Girl: Bye, daddy. Zora, no need to be like that. Come on, now, we got a little baby. Just had a baby. Come on, zora. How am I supposed to get to work? I didn't think she'd miss anything. Train tickets and a telegram were lying on the floor. So I snatched a few items and never looked back. No one saw you? I guess they were too busy looking for white carnations. I auditioned for a talent scout two weeks before I came here. I never thought in a million years I'd get the gig. Well, you know you got to go, right? I don't know. Come on. What do you mean, you don't know? I don't know. You gotta get out there and make a name for yourself. And, by the way, what is your name? Sally. Sally b. Shelly. Just a name. Not much. Sally b. Shelly. I like it. And soon enough, the rest of the world's going to love it. Starting with Chicago. You really think so? No doubt in my mind. Come with me. They didn't invite me. I'm inviting you. We're a team. I sing best when I sing for you. I don't know. I have so much to do around here. I have to take care of my father. Percival, if you don't mind my saying so, I think it's the other way around. You need him as an excuse so you can blame him for not following your dreams. Look, I checked the trains. There's a 9:00 to Chicago tonight. I'm buying us two tickets. Now, hold on, angel. It's Sally, remember? Sally. We can do this. I got my whole life here. Look, tonight's my last show. We could leave from the club. What do you say, piano player? I'm gonna take that as a yes. Flask: Well, you know, as the old saying goes, what goes around, comes around. What you know? You ain't nothing but a stupid-ass flask, anyway. Stupid? Well, you're the one talking to a flask. I got to stop drinking this shit. Flask: What goes around, comes around what goes around, comes around come on, sing it with me, man. It's called Karma. What the hell? Flask: Ain't no going around that one. Ain't no going around that. You'll have to get out and tell them to move the car. What seems to be the problem, ma'am? Did y'all run out of gas? No, sir. Not at all. These are my grandchildren. I see. Couple of months ago, my daughter run off to Detroit and left them with me. We ran out of money a while back. We've been sleeping in this car. This morning... This morning, the good lord sent me a message. He told me to drive and keep on driving until he told me to stop. And I did that. And then the good lord told me to turn down this here dirt road and to stop right here. And then? Then he told me to cut the car off and to wait. And that's what I've been doing. We've been waiting for almost seven hours. Waiting for what? I don't know. I don't know. But then you... Take this. Waiting for you. You. You're the angel that god told me to wait here for. I doubt that very seriously, ma'am. Thank you, Jesus. Yes. Emery. Emery, look. God sent this. Wait. Here. Go on. It's okay. Carry that with you. Always. You're my blessing. You're my blessing. You're my blessing. Y'all be safe. Thank you. Wake up, babies. Percy: You look so pretty. Like the belle of the ball. Yes, you are. Yes, you are. Music notes: Save us, percival. He's gone mad. I'm burning up. Save us. Jump. Jump! Save Mel Percival: Drunk old fool. You think for one minute that this girl loves you? Huh? She's trash. You hear me? Trash! You don't know her.

I gotta get away from here. I gotta try something new. Let's just sit down. Let's... let's talk about this. Now, come on. Talk about what? What do we have to talk about? We never talk. No, no, no. Wait. Listen to me. Listen, percival. I don't want you hurt. You're all I got in the world. And I need you. I'm leaving. Percival. Percival. Percival, wait a minute. Percival, wait a minute.
