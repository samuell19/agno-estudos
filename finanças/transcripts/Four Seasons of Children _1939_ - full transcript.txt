Let's go. I bought something for all of you today. Come on. Hurry. First come, first served. So hurry up. Sampei, why don't you get one? What's the matter? I don't want a plain woman's mask. You don't like it? "The Best one is the last one." Don't you think so? No. No? Does anybody want to change your mask with his? Not me. Not me. Not me. Nobody wants to change, Sampei. Why don't you take that one? I don't want it. If you take this, I'll take you home by horse. By horse? Really? Yes. So why don't you take this one? Okay. Do you want to change? No, take mine. You can have a long-nosed goblin. No way. Bleah! Can I get a ride tomorrow, too? Tomorrow? Sure, you can. The day after tomorrow. You can have one everyday. Really? Yes. Every single day, after school, I'll give you a ride. Thanks! Can you draw a moustache on this mask? Why do you want to do that? To make it look strong. It's weird if a woman has a moustache. Is there any rule that you can't? No. But it's weird. I don't care as long as it looks strong. Who gave you that? You know that old man who rides a horse everyday? It was him. He gave me a ride today. He'll give me a ride everyday. He promised me. "Subject: My grandfather My grandmother" Okay. Who's done? Yes. Go ahead, Tomizo. My grandfather has a curved back. He often coughs and he often yells at me. My grandmother is chubbier than my grandfather. She has bad eyes so it takes one or two hours for her to thread a needle. It takes me a second. So I do it for her. That's why she cares for me a lot. And I love her, too. Okay, Sampei. I don't have any grandfather or grandmother. I want one of each. I'd be happy if the old man on the horse was my grandfather. Yesterday, when he... he let me... ride on the horse, he smelled like grandfather. He smells good. And he'll give me a ride everyday. Oh, I'm running late. Think he's coming? Of course. He promised me. Do you think he'll let us ride on his horse too? Not without a promise. Let's trade masks. Then can I ride? I don't need your mask. Mine has a moustache now. A woman with a moustache? Yes. It looks good. What's wrong with you guys? Hey! I'll take him home and be back for you. What? I don't want to ride a horse anyway. I'm going to ride a cow. So your father's sick? I'm sorry. Has it been a long time? His fever's not going down. Oh that's a problem. Can I have a ride to town to get medicine? Sure. Go and leave your stuff then. Really? Yeah. So hurry up. San-chan has fallen off a cow! What? That's awful. Hurry and tell his mother. Sampei, are you alright? He's alright. That's good. Take him home. Sampei, what happened? Are you alright? It's your mother. Mother, I fell down. If he can speak, he's fine. Father. You're my father, aren't you? What are you doing? Go take care of him. Dear? Please don't get upset. What? I saw my father today. The old man on the horse that Sampei was talking about. That was him. What are we going to do? We can't do anything about it. That's true but... If our children found out... If they find out, they find out. It's better that way. They are old enough to know. But what if they wonder why their parents kept it secret until now. I don't want them to have any worries. Yes, so just let it be. It's going to be fine. Your father's getting older. So he wants to see his grandsons. Yes, I suppose. But if our children start going to the Ono's, people there, especially Mr. Rokai won't like it. He likes to cause trouble for people. We're in this situation because of him. I think he is planning something bad. Well, he's in a favorable situation. There's no heir to the Ono's house. So he wants to dominate the house and their company. Yes, I suppose. Let's not talk about that. Well... I can't stay sick like this forever. I need to get more and more cows, to enlarge our ranch, and pay back the money. The money? The money I borrowed. What will you do with it? It's none of your business. It's not fair. You're having fun everyday. I love my grandsons too. What do you think I'm doing everyday? Don't try to fool me. I know everything. You're not being clear. I'm not trying to fool you. Yes, you are. You go over the mountain everyday, travelling 13 miles to see your grandsons, right? I've been riding horses everyday for 50 years. Plus, our daughter married without permission. How could I know whether she has children or not. And if I did happen to know I wouldn't want to see the children of my disowned daughter. You're very stubborn. That's my nature. Well, I know what you're doing. You bought masks the other day. What did you do with them? What? What are you trying to say? You have a big mouth. You, too. What? Anyways, don't do anything without my approval. Boys! Do you know where the Aoyama's ranch is? That's where I live. What? So you must be Zenta or Sampei. I'm Sampei. Oh you are Sampei, I see. You're older than I thought. So Zenta must be bigger. Yes. I see. Which one is Zenta then? He's not here. I see. Take off your mask and let me see your face. You don't have to be scared. I'm your grandmother. Liar. I don't have a grandmother. Sampei! I cannot blame. He doesn't know anything. Mother! Doing laundry. Father? He's back working -- in the stable. I met a strange old lady. She said she's our grandmother. We don't have a grandmother, right? Right. Also, she said "Where's Zenta?" Yeah? Oh, she's coming. I'm going to tell Mother. Keep an eye on her. I'm scared. Stupid. Mother! Grandmother is coming. Grandmother? She said she's our grandmother. Sampei met her on the street. Do we have a grandmother? Dear, Dear! What? My mother is coming. Your mother? Sampei met her on the street. What are we going to do? She came a long way to see us. Can we see her? Zen-chan, let's go. Mother! She's already inside. San-chan! Later! Are you ready? Old man! School's out already? Today's Sunday. Oh, it's Sunday. Where's Sampei? An old lady's visiting his house. So he can't play now. An old lady? Yes. I see. She must have gone behind my back. Everybody, call San-chan. San-chan! Later! Sampei! Sampei! He's not here! That's her voice. Let's go! If Aoyama had come, that would've been everybody. I'm sorry that he's been sick. But it's still nice... Shuichi, you seem vacant. You're always sluggish and that's not good. Rokai. You also seem preoccupied. You always seem to be thinking about money and I don't like it. I have unfinished business, so if you don't like it. Oh, okay. Hisako, have a nice time. I'll visit him soon, but say hello to Aoyama. Hey, Kintaro! You're sneaking just like your father. What are you doing there? Kin-chan, go outside and play. Zen-chan, San-chan, why don't you go outside too? Want to go? Let's go. Gentlemen, come close. Kin-chan's a meek child. He's too shy. But Sampei's outgoing. He's just a little devil. It feels like yesterday that you two went to school in your uniforms. But now you're mothers talking about your sons. It must mean I've gotten really old. How many years are you apart in age? I'm two years older. But Mitsuko was like my older sister because I was so shy. No, you were just brought up like a princess. We were always together. Mitsuko is younger than me, but she acts like my older sister. Even now. Now, if you'll excuse me. They're coming! Run! They're coming! Chase them? No, don't. Do you have carp streamers? Yes, I have really big one my grandmother gave me. How many? What's that? They are all dead. What? Dead? They're not moving. Of course. There's no wind. They look like salmon. What? Salmon? They're salmon. They're not. Hung up like that? Ouch! Close the gate! He's not there. We're going to see the factory. Get on. "Ono Weaving Company" This factory, that smokestack and that tank will be all yours, Zenta, Sampei. See? This office, that cashbox and this desk will be all yours, too. Sampei, why don't you sit there. A little president. You look good there. Bring tea for the president. Shunichi, take a look. I think you need to clear this up. It'll make it easier for Aoyama when he comes back. What's the matter? I'm afraid there's something that I have to tell you. What's this? It's from a long time ago when Aoyama and Hisako got married without your approval I provided them with money to go to Osaka. That was a long time ago. And expenses for her maternity. And expenses to buy the ranch. It adds up to 3,000 yen now. Aoyama's having a hard time now. But I'm responsible for this. This is a family matter, so I just wanted to take care of it. But it's a large amount of money. I'll pay... But the funds came from this company and since it's owned by our family can't we just excuse it? Well... Of course this is my responsibility and oversight. But can't we just let it go and just write it off when we close the books? Or put it down as uncollectable expenses? But isn't there a better way to write it off? We'll still have to pay taxes on it, right? Let's figure out a better way. That lost money will be the price I pay for this reunion. Shunichi. This case... not just this case. But these problems come from your indecisiveness. You shouldn't have lent money to people I disowned. These problems arise from our corporate structure. What do you mean? I mean... If we were a general partnership or stock company nobody could get out of line. For example, lending money to someone should be discussed by members of the company. I see. That horse, this factory, and that cashbox will all be mine. He said the horse would be San-chan's. The company and the cashbox would be his too. That's not true, right? You've been driven like a horse for long time. And if Aoyama comes back, you'll never get ahead. Father, the horse and the cashbox really belong to San-chan? Yes. And when you grow up, you'll be driven like a horse by San-chan. Don't tell him that. Don't worry. The company will become a general partnership. What will change then? I will have the same rights and responsibilities as others. Now it's a limited partnership, so the old man and Shuichi have power. And small investors like me are just their slaves. But what would happen if Aoyama came back. He was disowned and owes money. Even that old man wouldn't give him power. Also, he can't just come back. Father, the horse really belongs to San-chan? Grandfather's late. What happened to him? Let's walk toward the mountain. Is your father home? Still sick. He shouldn't have worked the other day. Oh. That doesn't sound good. Maybe he knows about Grandfather. Let's ask him. You should appreciate what the Ono family has done for you. Last night I thought, "How much would this money make in 13 years?" If the profit is 10% a year, it's over 10,000 yen. 20% would be 30,000 yen. I'm one of the people in charge of management. Recently, we keep lowering workers' wages. It feels like we're squeezing from 80 employees. Rokai! No offence. I'm speaking as a business person. Did I ever say that I'd accept this note of debt forgiveness? Take it back with you. I'll pay back my debt. But... Please take it with you. If you'll excuse me. I have high fever. Fighting? Stupid. Maybe I said too much. But it's about a large amount of money. And I just wanted you to accept our favor. But if you say you don't accept it, I'll take it with me. Yes. You're just following orders. So just take the note and leave. The old man has a temper. I hope that this won't cause a big problem. I appreciate what he's doing. But you're just under orders. I won't accept anything from you. Tell him exactly what you said to me. I see. Sorry for the bother. Goodbye. Excuse me. What happened to Grandfather? Your grandfather? He might not come back. What happened? Let's ask Father. San-chan, bring me an ice bag. Zen-chan, go get some ice from the ice shop. Summer Sampei! Where are you going? I'm going to swim. Father's in the hospital. How could you do that? Mother said we should stay home. I'm writing a letter to Grandparents. Why don't you write, too. So they'll come. Are you sure? Yes. Then I'll write. "It's summer vacation now." "Grandfather and Grandmother," "you don't come to see us anymore. Why is that?" "Father's in the hospital in the town." "Mother's with him so there's just two of us at home." "We need you. Come and see us" "Zenta, Sampei." Poor kids. He's home. There's a letter from Zenta and Sampei. What? They sent me a letter? Why it's open? Because I opened it. I won't read unsealed letters. But it says "Grandfather and Grandmother." They want me to read it too. I'm head of this family and your husband. It's rude to open a letter on which my name is first. I won't read it. No. Please read it. I said I won't. You sure? Yes! Aoyama is in the hospital and Hisako is with him. The children are alone at home. They want us to come and see them. Even so, you still won't read it? You don't feel sorry for them? You don't want to read it for them? Aoyama's scared of me, and uses his kids to get my attention. You're horrible. He'll ask me to provide hospital expense next. How could you... So you think this letter is fake? Even if it's not, I don't pity someone who rudely returned the note I sent. Do you think they got the letter? I think so. Grandfather'll come? Yes. Grandmother, too? Yes. Then they'll come on the horse together. With presents? Yes. A lot of them. Let's climb this tree. Okay. They really got the letter? Hey. You're not asleep yet? Your eyes were open too. I think I hear the sound of hoofs. Me too. I thought I heard the sound, and got up. But then, Sarayama's snore cut it. That's right. It's noisy. Let's plug his nose with newspapers. That's a good idea. Zen-chan, San-chan! Open the door. Zen-chan! He went to the hospital! San-chan! What? Don't tell your grandmother. Is San-chan really coming? Yes. He's coming right away. I want to go home. Come on! Sampei is coming in a second. I don't like him. What? You don't like him? Why didn't you come and see him alone. What about you? I said I didn't want to. But you took me here anyway. I'm bored. It's hard to come here by myself. Let's go home. Wait. Oh, Kinta is here too. Let's go to my house. Hey! Sampei, Sampei! You can play with Kinta. Let's test endurance. Endurance? Kintaro. Call San-chan. No. No? I'm scared. You're a coward. Sampei! San-chan! Later! He's studying right now. Later! What're you doing? Testing endurance. Endurance? I'm in. Did Father get well? He got way better, they said. How's Mother? Tomorrow's the collecting day. So she'll come. Oyama gets two bottles on the first of the month. Two on the second. Four on the third. Aoyama gets two on the second, two on the third and... Okay. I'm done. Can we go and collect money tomorrow? It's harder than you think. We can do it. Let's take a calf with us. A cute calf, then we might get new customers. Let's do it! Grandmother! We'll collect money with a calf. Oh yeah? I wonder why people are not paying. If they can pay it next month, why not this month? But we've got new customers. Let's take more calves next time, so we'll get more new customers. I hope that all of the nation will be ours. Hey! Why don't you come swim? You want to swim? Can I borrow this loincloth? Why don't you dive? The calf ran away! The calf ran away. She went that way. She came home. What's the matter? The calf ran away. What happened to the bag of money? Oh we forgot it. The cow was 800 yen when we bought. We shouldn't have sold it for 80 yen. But she doesn't give milk. And we desperately need money to pay the hospital expense. Will it be much longer? I hope he'll get better soon. Come on! Where is he going to take her? Not that way! Be good! Shoot! Don't! What are you doing with our cow? Get off of me! Get away from me! Idiot! Fool! Why don't you move? Fool! Ow! Screw you! Move! Mr. Kamahara! What happened to the cow? She'll become beef. Stupid! She won't become beef! Mother, when did you come back? A while ago. I have something to do. Did you sell the cow? She's getting old and she is pretty much dry now, so. The calf will miss her mother. Your father needs more time. And hospital expense is really expensive. Will she really become beef? Stupid. That's not true, right? Yeah. I feel sorry for the calf whose mother was taken. Father's sickness will linger for awhile. I'll work really hard from tomorrow. Me too. Get more customers. All of the nation will become our customers. Mother! I'll work hard from tomorrow! We'll make all of the nation our customers! "To Mr. Aoyama" "Please pay as listed immediately." They're taking advantage of us since we're women and children. When Rokai came with that note, they ended up in a quarrel. I know that Rokai is behind this. But Grandfather can't do this. He knows that Aoyama's been sick. I'll go and give this back to him. But Mother... It'll be alright. Leave this to me. I don't know about this at all. But that's from your company. You're the owner, right? Yes. But I never sent this letter. Well, then who did? I'll ask Shunichi and Rokai. I never sent this letter. Well, then who did? Let's ask Rokai. Rokai, did you send this letter? Yes. You did? How dare you? Is this some kind of joke? Who's behind this? Who ordered you to? We reorganized as a general partnership, I checked the unpaid debts for the first time closing. The resolution to do that was passed last Friday. You didn't have to include Aoyama's. But that's money of the company. We can't just ignore him. And when I visited him with the note he clearly said he'd pay it back. Alright. I'll assume Aoyama's debt. Change it to my name. But why is it now 127,000 yen. How did you calculate the interest? 3,000 yen at 30% for 13 years reckoning compound interest. It's in the company's bylaws. Since we reorganized. In the bylaws? Bring me a copy of the bylaws. The bylaws mean more to us than civil law. San-chan! Zen-chan! Zen-chan, San-chan! Your father's gotten worse. Let's go! Thank you for coming. Come here. I'm not going to die. But in case I don't get better. I want to tell you one thing. It's for both of you. As you live your life don't think to gain more than other people. If people would pay 5 sen to buy something you pay 10 sen. If people would pay 10 sen you pay 15 sen. It works for anything. Studying. Working. The idea is the same. And doing that, you live strongly strongly and properly. Get that? If you understand that, you are free to go now. Goodbye, Father. Goodbye. Zen-chan, San-chan!

This is your home. Don't ever think that you're strangers here. I know that you want to take on Aoyama's dreams and run his ranch. But since you're just a woman and children Rokai might come after you. To avoid that, the ranch will temporarily be someone else's. When Zenta and Sampei grow up you'll take it back as was decided. So you don't have to worry about it. Okay? Sampei is really cheeky. I won't play with him. Let's not play with him, okay? Oh he's coming. Hey guys! Come here. Let's go! Let's go. Run! He's coming! Close the gate! Oh, carp! Awesome. They let Aoyama's family live with them. They might make those children Ono's heirs. Although you became a partner you couldn't do anything about that. You're just a small investor. So we can't expect many dividends. I don't know if we can afford Kin-chan's university fees. Under the Ono's care, those two can go to university and walk proudly. It's okay. I won't play with him. I'll never ever play with him. Do you know where Sampei is? No, we don't! Where's Sampei? He left school early. Grandfather! Where's Sampei? He hasn't come home yet. I didn't see him at school. He left early. What? What happened to him? Run! I see. They've been fighting. Zenta, you look for that way. I'll go this way. Sampei! What are you doing? I'm playing with carp. With carp? They're so funny. I gave them a half of my lunch. We're friends now. Here, look. Awesome! Come here. That's awesome. Here, give it a try. Hey, Sampei! You left early? Everyone's being mean to me. So you're fighting with them. Then I'll play with you. I'll make you a dummy horse and a swing. Let's go home. I'm playing with carp. With carp? They're so funny. Right? Yes. Really? Let's see. Oh this is wonderful! Come to my house! I got a dummy horse and a swing! Let's play with them! Grandfather! Can I let Kin-chan ride them? Of course. Kintaro, why don't you play? Kin-chan, let's play together. Kin-chan, let's go! Everybody, come on! Let's take Kin-chan there! Carry him! Mother, I stopped fighting with San-chan. He's really funny. This is a draft of my speech. Listen to it. As you know, we're a general partnership company. Capital investors are the Onos and Rokai. Regarding this loan some of you think that I'm pressing it out of greed. But if we take the money back in full and each take a share, mine'd be small. And most of it would go to the Onos. However, oddly enough, they are trying to write it off this a large amount of money. And what I'm trying to do is collect it in order to generate profits bringing raises and bonuses for everyone. That's the reason I wanted to collect. It's just for the good of the company. It's not out of my own greed at all. By the way, the debtor was Ichiro Aoyama. He was a nephew and a son-in-law of Mr. Ono. And now the debt is assumed by Mr. Ono. But in a general partnership company one can't represent the company and make deals with oneself. That means you can't write off the money that you owe your company. And that makes me the only investor who can deal with this problem. Capital investors are the Onos and Rokai. And regarding... You'll give a speech today? ...some of you think that I'm pressing it out of greed. But if we take the money back in full... Ei-chan! What? My father'll give a speech today. Do you want to go? Saku-chan! My father'll give a speech. Do you want to go? Shii-chan! Do you want to go listen a speech? San-chan! What? My father'll give a speech today. Everybody's coming. Do you want to go? Speech? Today's Sunday. Maybe Rokai's up to something again. So as you can see I'm doing it for good business via the bylaws of this company. Kin-chan's father gave a speech. It was really good. We clapped. Okay. Go home and play with the horse and swing. Let's go! So you gave a speech? Yes. A little one. Is there any problem? What was it about? I see. Why don't you take a look? You reasoned it out really well. What will a fox do before attacking a chicken? Give a nice speech. It makes good excuses then attacks the chicken. I'm not comfortable with the word "fox." It could be a raccoon or a weasel or a badger... It's you! What? You, Rokai! Damn you! Whoa, hold on! I won't talk about past favors, but listen. Can you say that I ever once wronged you? I don't like the way you do business. You use laws against a man whom you owed for 20 years. I can stand an idiot or lazy person but not a villain. And you're a villain! Is that all you have to say? What? Hey, Rokai! You're my brother-in-law but I can't take this. So I'm forsaken by everyone. Only the law is on my side. The time has finally come when we must give up all of our assets including this house. I don't know much about laws. But you have to pay back what you owe. And it always comes with interest. Even if you own the company you have to draw a line between public and private. I don't know what Rokai is up to but in theory it sounds fair. So don't get upset if they come to seize everything today. And we mustn't have regrets. I'm first! Wait, wait! This horse and swing and everything belong the company now by Rokai's order. It's not yours anymore. This house, this yard and this storehouse, too taken by the company. So you can't play here anymore. It won't be a long time. Because we have a lawyer. Go outside and play. You can play in the mountains and rivers -- everywhere. Get it? So go out and play. Let's go out then. Come on, Kin-chan! I'll ask my father for the horse and swing. Let's go with him! Oh, the company! Father, I want the horse and the swing back. Father! Father! Father, I want them back! Shut up! Ooh, that was scary. I'll go home and ask my mother. Mother! I want the horse and the swing back. The horse? Father took them away from us. I want them back. You can't go to the Ono's house anymore. You can play here at home. We have toys and books and lots more. Why? Do you want to come in and play at my house? Let's go! Let's play! Everybody, come in. I'll be back! Grandfather! Can I play at Kin-chan's house? Yes, you can. Kin-chan! It's San-chan! Later! San-chan! San-chan! Don't play with San-chan and Zen-chan anymore. They'll be mean to you. I'm not fighting with San-chan. I don't care. You can't play with San-chan and Zen-chan. Or Father'll scold you. You want to go? Do you? Yeah. Let's go pick sweet acorns. Let's go! I'll play with San-chan. Kin-chan! Your father'll punish you! I hate you! Here are some! A lot of them! San-chan, here are some. Let's see. Oh yeah! I'll climb the tree and shake it. Kin-chan, can you go up higher? Kin-chan! Oh! He fell! Kin-chan! Are you alright? Kin-chan! Kin-chan! They're coming! No, don't get up. Come in. You have to play with Kin-chan a lot today. And I'll make you a lot of food. So just come in. I'll make you a lot of good food. Winter Come to my house. Zenta. Did you choose between middle school or career school? You have to apply soon. Have you talked to your parents about it? You haven't? You were hoping for middle school. Your parents disagreed with you? If that's so, why don't you tell them what you want again? If you want, I'll talk to them. You don't need to cry. What's the matter? I'm not going to either of them. Why? Your parents don't want you to? No. I don't want to go. What are you doing here? Waiting for you. Why? Sampei. Want to go to the ranch? Do you? Let's go! Okay! Why were you crying? It was nothing. You didn't do your homework so you got punished? Stupid. Because you just went to bed last night. I won't go to middle school. "Nakagawa's Ranch" Calves got big. They give milk now? Not yet. Let's walk her. Okay. Zen-chan! San-chan! You got big. Yes, we did. She got big, too. Zen-chan and San-chan are here! I wonder where Zenta and Sampei are. Their grandfather went looking for them. Maybe he's playing with them again. I'll go see how Kin-chan's doing. Zenta! San-chan! Kin-chan! You're alone? They went ahead. Why don't you ride on my back? You're early today. Don't you need to study? I don't care. Don't leave him behind. Help him get home. I'll carry you on my back. Come on, Sampei! Come on! I'm tired. I'll carry you this time. I'll carry you this time. Ouch! I'll carry you home. Hang on! Come on, Sampei! You can do it! Strong boy! Come on now! Come on! Are you okay? Come on! Hang in there! Hang on! Hang on, Sampei! Almost there! Hang in there! You can see the goal now! Come on! Hang on! Don't give up! Hang on! Come on! You can do it! Come on! Almost there! Hang on! Is that all you got? Come on! That's it! Hang on! Almost there! Hang in there! You're almost there! Sampei, you're almost there! Almost! Hang on! You made it! Mother! San-chan and the others carried me! Really? Thank you, boys. Why don't you play with Kin-chan here? Zen-chan and San-chan, too, right? I'm going home. Me, too. Zen-chan, you can stay, right? Yes. Then why don't you? Kin-chan's not ready to go out yet. Brother's not coming. Go in? Okay. Zen-chan and San-chan carried Kintaro on their back from school today. And played with him all day. They told me that the old man said he can give up the company he built but he can't just let go of the ancestral house. Poor children. Can I go to Zen-chan and San-chan's house tomorrow? I promised today. Can I ride their dummy horse? And their swing, too? Father! Father! Shut up! Go to bed! Kin-chan's mother gave them a feast. I heard about that. I feel sorry for her being married to a man like Rokai. You two were really close when you were children. Everyone thought that we were sisters. She was strong-minded then. San-chan! Hurry up. Everyone's coming. Come in! Let's go. "Notice of Seizure" The paper's still there. Kin-chan! Ask your father. We're not allowed to touch it. Let's go play with the carp! Where's Kin-chan? Let's take Kin-chan, too. Why did you come back? Because... As long as you are good, she won't get mad. His mother's really nice. Because... Can't you take the horse and the swing back from Father? Kin-chan! They're coming. Let's go play with the carp. He's coming! Let's go! Don't run! Hold on to me. Hey! Be quiet! I told you what will happen if you don't quiet down. If that rumor is right and Rokai's also an executive at Yamaoka Weaving that's a big problem. I can't believe it. But maybe he thinks that if he can pit the companies against each other he'll get a good position. And if it's true? Well, I'll leave it to the lawyer to figure out if it's illegal. I'll just go see my sister and ask about Rokai. Kin-chan! Kin-chan! Be quiet! He often said that he hasn't gotten anywhere after a long time working at the Ono's. I was frustrated, too. So he wanted to make the company bigger -- and himself as well. And to do that, he said he should be more aggressive. But he never thought of becoming an executive of the other company and betraying the Ono's. I think so, too. But I just heard the rumor. I know what he resented is low position. I know he wasn't happy with his low position. That's why I looked the other way. But if the rumor is true, I can't forgive him. I think that everything he did was for himself first, but also for the Ono's in the long run. So I don't want you to think he's scheming to bring the Ono's down. You're late. Where have you been? Zen-chan, it's not only today. Where've you been these days? Why don't you tell her? Zen-chan. Why can't you tell me? Why can't you tell your mother? Mother, he was just... San-chan, leave us alone! Zen-chan, your teacher came here today. I understand what you're doing. But if your grandfather finds out about it... Tell her you were playing with the carp. She got mad because you hid it. Oh, you're home. I was looking for you all over. Where have you been? You two are fighting again? We're not fighting. Brother is... Sampei! Grandfather! I won't go to middle school. What? I want to go back to the ranch and work there. Children should look straight ahead and walk proudly. Your school expenses are not a problem. You don't have to worry about that. I want to join the Navy. Read me letters we received today. "Yamaoka Weaving Company." "A document of resolution." "Board of Directors: Juro Yamada and Teizo Rokai..." Dear! Dear! What? What is this? So you're an executive of Yamaoka Weaving... Why're you crying? It's none of your business. Stop crying! Stupid! We have a rule that prohibits working for our competitors. If you become a director of another company that's in the same business as this one, you'll be expelled. You must have known that. Or are you the proverbial monkey that fell from the tree? Anyways, you have to agree to these three terms. "Break off relations with Yamaoka Weaving." "Agree all company decisions will be made by vote." "Drop the lawsuit about the loan." That's three. If you can't agree, we'll start discussing expulsion. Remove me. What? He's quite a person. A very thorough villain. If he gave in to us, I would've been disappointed. But he was gracious in the end. So the lawsuit will be dissolved, too. English Subtitles by Tsuyoshi Koide and Greg Lindeman
