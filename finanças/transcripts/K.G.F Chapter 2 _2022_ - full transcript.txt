A fearless prince in the dead of the night began the search for his destiny. That day, amidst the raging storm on the ship alone without fearing anyone he sailed over the glittering sea. Mom Hmm? Why does the sea glitter? Because there lies an ocean of gold beneath the sea. That's why it glitters. Mom Are you…so fond of gold? There is no woman in the world who isn’t fond of gold. Mom I will fetch you all the gold in this world. Fine! Time to go to sleep now. You can do that in the morning. OK? Hmm. Close your eyes. [sings lullaby] No one shall ever read or write anything about him. His name and identity… should be erased from the pages of history. I am enforcing the army… and signing the death warrant… of the biggest criminal in India. Anand Ingalgi suffered a stroke at 4am Sir. He is in ICU at St. Mary's Hospital. Due to high BP, there is brain hemorrhage and lot of clots in his brain. Taking his age as consideration, surgery is ruled out. To be very honest, he has got very little time. Let’s hope for the best. Doctor… does he have any relatives? Yeah! His son is there. Vijayendra Ingalgi. Hi! I'm Deepa Hegde. I am sorry about your father. I hope he recovers soon. He was a good man. How do you know my father? Your father has authored a book. We interviewed him yesterday. He narrated half the story. Today he was supposed to finish the story. But… I guess… it will remain unfinished. I'm not sure if he was a good man or not. But I'm sure he was not a good father nor a great husband. As a child, I don’t remember him playing with me. He never checked my marks-cards. He had no idea when I started smoking. Not that I cared! He didn’t shed a tear when my mother died. In fact, he never noticed me leaving home. I am seeing him after 25 years. But all that mattered to him was that story. The story of KGF! The story of Rocky! Don’t know if that is a fact or fiction. But he lived for that story and.. it cannot go unfinished! That means… the remaining story are you going to narrate? He will only narrate. Go straight, you will find a Hanuman temple. 4kms ahead from there you will find that exact place. The military had a base there until four years back. No trespassing was allowed. Why are you venturing into that place Sir? There is only dust and mud here. An empire here? -Hey come on-- -Hey Mason Uh? Do you see that wild date palm tree? Dig 35 feet around it. Hmm…Hmm What are you looking for Sir? I too have no idea. Anand Sir prohibited us to even clean the library. Besides them, you are the first person to set foot inside. Be careful Sir! That's enough! Open. Hello! Hey, work is going on. I cannot come now. Lots to do! Will be there in the morning. [indistinct chatter] Hey hurry, get that JCB here. Brother… it seems to be a huge boulder. Hey, get the rope and the chain quickly. OK, I will call you later. There must be another copy of the book somewhere. Search for it! Hey just lower it further. Tie the rope! [indistinct chatter] OK get back. Move away! Move! You still don’t believe all this could be true? It could be the work of a mad man! Lots of journalistic material and photographs here. But I am sure how much ever you search you'll not find a single photograph of my mother. Not that I care! And you know what? I don't think you are concerned either. Right…let it down slowly. Story seems interesting. That's why you are here. Right? Hmm! Were you looking for this Sir? What is this Sir? Untie the rope. Let's find out. Eh? A democratic nation amidst 700 million people such a vast empire such a robust system. How? I am not only concerned how it was made possible… but also curious about who won there. Wars are waged for the sake of victory. Victories are achieved to create history. [muffled voices] History always wins. [muffled voices] And somewhere hidden in those pages of history… Sir! Sir! is the biggest kept secret in the history of India! EL… …DORADO! Sir… Sir excuse me. Sir! The article that I submitted yesterday the place under the survey number that I had mentioned as missing It's not published? I’ve been printing news in this press for many years. But I don’t want to be the NEWS myself. This matter is no secret. The interest that my father had in this the CBI Special Wing had the same amount of interest. The west coast disturbances, irregularities in the Bombay refineries, excessive flow of gold in the black market… distribution trails and hundreds of witnesses. All fingers are pointing towards one direction Sir! KGF! But… not even a single charge sheet filed yet, Sir? Which batch are you Ramesh? Sir… '74 Sir! I'm '54! The effort to excavate the gold from the mines in KGF is huge. The effort to reveal the truth about KGF by the CBI is as enormous. But those documents will remain in the locker and nobody will do anything about it. You see that clock? It’s stuck for days. They are least bothered to repair it. And about this matter you think they will bother? KGF was a well-oiled machine. Everybody knew that the cat stealthily drank the milk. But no one had the courage to bell the cat. What happened in KGF after Garuda's death? Will you read it? Apart from the death of Garuda in KGF, the outside world knew nothing. But on the next day, in Pali, where major decisions are taken… Rajendra Desai, Gurupandian, Andrews and Kamal gathered for Garuda’s brother Virat's coronation. -Boss! -Boss! Is Garuda no more? Not sure if Garuda’s pyre is lit or not Virat is already showing his true colors. He has planned his own grand entry. This is very unlike Virat. The more careless Virat is the easier it is for us. What about Gurupandian? We have downed a mammoth crushing a sheep is no big deal. Don’t you worry! To aspire to set foot and rule Narachi is impossible! Where did Virat.. get this temerity from? I will… kill him myself! Uh! Ah! That Bombay guy what's his name? Hmm… Rocky! Aah! Isn't he already killed? Huh! I missed the chance! He was sent to KGF to kill Garuda. But he went there to rule KGF. For that, he had to kill Garuda first and escape the guards. Most importantly, had to gain the trust of the people. He created a short circuit and crossed the white line. Primarily, he went there to kill Virat. Disguised as one of the three inmates he slayed Garuda in everyone’s presence. When Vanaram’s guards stood with the guns the oppressed slaves inspired by Rocky’s feat trounced the guards and surged ahead! The people accepted Rocky as their Emperor! Don't touch me! Reena! What are you doing here? Was at a restaurant with friends. They have forcefully brought me here. Who is that? Dear Lord! Let no more lives be lost for the sake of this throne! Hmm! That's Rocky… the one who killed Garuda! It's him! Eh! Please sit down. It’s enough if you have respect and fear within you. All are ONE! Virat? Viraaat….Virat! Finished him off! Tch! Pity! Gone too soon! Hmm… You have established a fantastic council here. Hey, why are you all so gloomy? Don’t worry, you are in safe hands. Am new to the place but not new to the field. I will ensure that your company progresses. Need your cooperation, support and blessings…that's enough! Hey! Do you think its a game of Kho-Kho to switch positions at will? To safeguard and continue our rich family legacy built over generations is why we are all born! Won’t let an outsider like you to take control. Nepotism! What has happened to our country? Rampant recommendation, donation, domination, influence, bribe… What should the poor kids do? Is there no place for toppers, non-corrupt and the hard-working people? What should the person do, who single-handedly chopped the head off! MERIT! Am here only on merit! I deserve some respect. Your parents have stashed enormous wealth. But they made a mistake! They gave birth to you in my lifetime. I shall keep on ruling and you watch me rule! What do you say darling? Am I right? Why have you brought me here? Tell me that first! To keep you… In KGF… for safety my dear. These are dangerous people. Not just that being the head of such a big Company don't I need some company? Entertainment! You are my entertainment, my dear! Hey, stop this! You seem to have a big ego! I have been watching you. You are talking nonsense! How dare you insult my girl in my presence! -Kamal, what are you doing? Sit down.-- -Is she your entertainment? -You are crossing the limits.-- -What are you doing? Sit down. Hey! Do you know your worth? Living off the pittance you earned as a shoe polisher in Mumbai slums. That! That is your true worth! He's ruling over us today because you stopped me that day. Kamal! Don’t touch me! People must be shown their right place. You have now let a stray dog occupy the throne. Ah? Ah..he escaped the other day but not today, no chance! He is my prey and I am going to kill him. Ahhh! Aaah! Where was I? Entertainment, haha! You’re my entertainment, my love! C'mon dear! Let's go! Hey, don’t touch her! Hey Hey Hey What! They are all partners. If none of them survive how will I get the business done? We created a ‘Rocky’ to kill Garuda. Is it so difficult for us to create another ‘Rocky’ to kill you? Even my father was not able to it’s impossible for anyone to create another ROCKY. One and Only piece! You reared a snake to chase the rats out of the house. That too a King Cobra! Now it’s your turn to move out. Hope you have made other arrangements! [muffled voice] Hey Farman! What are you upto? Why are you holding the gun? Throw it aside and come down. Come! Your father sacrificed his life to save you both. Imagine your mother’s fate if something was to befall you. Hmm! Ahh! What did you eat today Boranna? -Radish curry…prepared by Basappa. -Ha! Four days back? He provided us with clothes. He's building homes for us. Got us medicines… and helped us live respectfully. Don’t forget all his help now and in the past. He freed us from bondage. For him… I am ready to sacrifice my life. [kids shouting] Hey! Come here for a minute. [kids exclaiming] I knew it I am the best looking amongst all of us. [kids exclaiming] I am wearing this after ten years. If God has to safeguard us, they say we have to pray. But even to offer prayers he had to save us! Uhh! [kids exclaiming] One who strikes with the hammer! He will be here. Get dressed as soon as possible. He'd like to… see you in this attire. Juice is ready. Do you need anything else sister? [frightened voices] Don't brother! She will kill you for sure. Ahh! [women weeping] [muffled voice] Why? I am already deathed dear. Our tradition is to light a lamp to welcome home the girl for the first time. But here you are celebrating the festival of lights. Drat! I did want to showoff the richness. But these guys have gone overboard. Finish the juice once your anger subsides. Get energized Umm! I shall then take you out for a hunt. This is the most comfortable room here. it will be nice if you are around. Don't get scared and rush into my room! The moment an unmarried couple is seen together the tongues start wagging. Its hurts! Its hurts! We have stationed 500 men with guns all. But they don’t even know to hold them. How will they use them? They will learn. Everything! [muffled voices] Eh… Hey! Why have you still spared him? He should have been eliminated much earlier! Will you kill your commander-in-chief? The moment you free me from these chains I’ll kill you with my bare hands! Are you offended because I killed Garuda? [Rocky scorns] In the game of Chess when the Soldiers Knights Bishops Rooks and finally the Queen are eliminated AND the King is checkmated… the Game is over! Rearrange the pawns… a new Game begins! The same rules, the same board. But… a new King! People are not permanent here only positions are! You’ve been around since the inception of this place guarding and protecting these walls! The right moves are important for me while you value the boundaries more. I am sure that you will not tolerate the destruction of this place. My next move now will create… a major havoc! When I went to the maintenance room to check the map, I noticed something. I couldn’t understand at first but now it all makes sense. I know why you refer to this existing Mine as Sector three by nine! Hey Farmaan! -Where are you going? -Rocky boss is calling. I'll be back soon. FARMAAN! Ah Brother! Greetings brother! [frightened voices] Where are they shooting? Get him here! [frightened voices] Vanaram is still alive! Unlock the chains! [muffled voices] Give him a gun! Ahh! Right from holding the gun to pulling the trigger… keep observing him. [muffled voice] [frightened voices] I will guard again but only on my terms. Before guarding the main gateway there is a significant barrier. There is a check post. Three hundred guards must be posted there immediately! Trained 300 guards! Rocky is building an army and has retained Vanaram. He is planning something big. And all of it seem related to Sector three by nine. There is so much mystery around it, isn’t it? Don’t dramatize it so much after all its fiction, right? I have known Anand long before you were born. In fact, I know your father more than I know you. Don’t question his integrity. Anand… doesn’t have much time left. Please… continue. If he has retained you then it must be for a big festival! Why have you summoned us all here? Sector three by nine. was an existing operational Mine. Which was established by Suryavardhan in 1951. Why are you all standing here? There is no monster inside. -Come inside. -Go in if you want, we won’t. It was… one out of nine. One… of nine… of what? It's a lie! And you have been lying for ages. They say Dream within your limits That's the biggest lie! The rich have always misled the poor. But according to me… greed is good! greed is progress! If there is progress… One becomes Two… Two becomes Three… Three becomes Four… Five… Six… Seven… Eight… Nine! So… were there… nine Mines? You see, when Suryavardhana started off he had a vision to sustain the empire for centuries. So, he ensured the other eight Mines were shrouded in secrecy… to ward off evil intentions. But Rocky… firmly decided to excavate all the gold in two years. Why should one dream within limit? Sky is my limit! Boss, no one is entering the Mines! Hey partners! No more conspiring. Get ready to work. Time to progress! Let’s reap a rich harvest! Deepavali! eh? You enquired about the Big Festival. None of them can hold the ground. What can he achieve with these cowards? Yes sir! As you said… we had no courage no strength no belief. The sword was hanging on our heads! But one man stood in between and slashed a throat during Maari festival ♪Waves have risen in the Ocean♪ ♪This fierce hurricane♪ That day, after several years we celebrated death! ♪ Mountains are trembling!

Please choose a name for her. Shanthi! Mother! [muffled voices] It's time. I will take leave. [muffled voices] [kids chattering] Rocky is sending the raw material to Varca for extraction. If we don’t stop him now… the extracted gold will be his and the leftover scrap will be ours. The old game is over. They have rearranged the pawns and have started a new game. Take it from the top so that everyone knows. Till date, no one is aware of the happenings in KGF. Who is controlling it is also a mystery! But according to my sources there has been entirely new leadership. They all have been assassinated sir. Aye! Aye! How long do we live in fear? What are you saying? Even though we are Central Ministers, our hands are tied! We are dancing to Gurupandian’s tunes. Suryavardhan is dead and so is Garuda! And now it seems a new master has taken over. Somebody else from this organization is controlling it? No Sir! It seems an outsider has forcefully taken control. What? We were more worried about the strength… of the rock we had planned to crush. How is this even possible? Now we realize that the hammer was far more threatening than the rock! Amidst these powerful people… one more? Hey, out with it! Shetty sir, a new boss has taken over KGF. Who? ROCKY! He had an eye on your coveted throne since his childhood. He’ll arrive this time and occupy the throne. He’s now your boss, as well as mine. Enough of the oppression of KGF! Let's put an end to it now. How? If Gurupandian and his government falls she will emerge right? She will put an end to it. We have to now get the commitment from other MPs. Inayath Khalil’s number is in the table drawer, Shetty Bhai. Rest is upto you. How do we destroy that hammer now… think about it! -Ah! Boss! -Boss! Find out if this is true! Otherwise… find out about this… outsider. Is this all? Does not suffice! Work harder! Mining should continue day and night. [frightened voices] These walls have witnessed a lot of bloodshed. The reason for that is this sword! Adheera's sword! Do you know why people are so scared to see the sword of a dead man? Adheera in his childhood was influenced by the Vikings clan adopted their ruthless tactics and became the epitome of cruelty. He ensured that no one dared point fingers towards KGF. He forced people to toil in the Mines. More importantly to fulfill his brother's wish he created an empire mercilessly on the might of his sword. If he was around he would not have let you set foot in KGF. Rocky had taken control of the most precious piece of land on earth To gain control of that people were ready to kill ready to be killed and even… come back from the dead. Aren’t you dead yet? Your urge to kill seems unsatiated. You want more wars to wipe out the world? The swing of a sword and the splash of blood in a battle is not to destroy… but to progress! The fallen corpses there are useful too. If you are in doubt, ask the vultures! Do you think you are invincible? To raise a towering fortress you must first dig deep. If you explore the depths of this empire’s foundation, you will not find stones but the skulls of my adversaries. He will stop you! Our God will stop you! I've heard… ROCKY! I will crush him. A puny person like me single-handedly managed to block your army and send shivers down your spine. Imagine to what extent he could go. It's a waste of time to focus on small fries. Eliminate the big fish! After all, your God… is also made of flesh and blood. What’s so urgent? You asked me to come alone. Rocky can be eliminated. For that, we need him out of there first. How to get him out? If we get Reena out…he'll follow. How’s that possible? If there are rumors about your well-being? Nobody will believe that. If it is on TV… won't they believe? Last night on the outskirts of Bangalore industrialist Rajendra Desai was shot dead. There seems a link between this murder and disappearance of industrialist Kamal and it appears that there is a big conspiracy behind this. [breathing heavily] Let's go! Rocky has been brought out! Where are they leading him to? He is coming! [muffled voices] We never thought he’d reach KGF. Killing Garuda there seemed impossible. Never imagined that he would control KGF. He’s a shrewd player. We can't be certain that he will not wrestle his way out of this web. Hey! Aah! A fish assumes that the worm is its prey. Only when it bites, it realises it is a bait! And this time we know who is holding the bait. It's impossible to escape. [sighs] [distinct laughter] [coughs] [heavy breathing] The God… is on his knees. Did you miss reading the board? I’ve come a long way, severed several heads… to build KGF! You are just a novice! Just by trouncing a handful of people, do you think that… you elevated yourself? This is not a game of just ladders… but also snakes! There is this one deadly snake and if it bites you’ll reach the nadir! Go! I'm sparing you. I wont take your life today. Because, I want you to go to your people. They have a lot of faith in you. They have to see you in this state. [people wailing] They have to see your blood Break their faith! Hey…who did this? Adhee…Adheera is still alive! That bridge all those who went there Adheera killed them! [people wailing] Proclaim to them. I am coming! To reclaim my sword… and my KGF! The head is chopped off. How long will the body sustain? Is everyone here? In 25 years, there were many no-confidence motions against Gurupandian. But until now no one had raised hands. Today a proposal by the opposition party has been put forth for a no-confidence motion. Whoever intends to vote please raise your hands. Stop the trucks leaving for Varca! Trucks have already left for Varca sir! Shetty, for the first time had gathered all Rocky’s supporters for a feast. [indistinct chatter] Breaking news! Result of the No Confidence Motion from the parliament. It is against Gurupandian’s DYSS party. This may pave the way for the next general election. Is the job done? Kochi, Mangalore, Kasipur, Surat and Murad all of Rocky’s stooges here have been killed Shetty Bhai! The West Coast is all yours now! A vote for no confidence motion will be held at a further date. [distinct laughter] Hey, the truck is coming! Adheera had sent a message that no one should set foot outside KGF. [frightened voices] Brother! Rescue us! Send men to the West Wall immediately! Spruce up the security here! None of our people should step out of here. Shut the main gates! [distinct laughter] Didn’t last for long. Everything fell apart! He lost again. Shetty and Inayath Khaleel took control of the west coast. He had no say in Delhi now. The distributors abandoned him. Adheera cut off all access to KGF. Ration could last for only eight days. There is fear everywhere. Rocky… His survival is in doubt. I treat small injuries. I have tried my best. Beyond that, its left to God. Why? What happened? I'm here for you. Don't be scared. Go to sleep. Shh…shh! [coughs] Hey Rocky Bhai! So you are the king now? [distinct laughter] You were better off here. Feeding on the leftovers. Where did you go away? In search of name and fame. Now…you will die a dog's death! But I’ll give you another chance. Sit next to me on the floor and massage my feet. Come. Ah! And listen. Heard that you have a pretty girlfriend. Bring her along with you! Don't forget! [distinct laughter] Isn’t he your friend? He probably needs entertainment too… Send me away. -Sir…let me see him once-- -Not allowed. Boss is unwell. Please… Hey…let her in You are more than God to my son sir. You have always been in his thoughts. You posted him…to guard the bridge. [crying inconsolably] They killed him! Not sure where he is lying dead…my son! Vultures must be devouring him… [crying inconsolably] You want to be king right? For that… luck and people’s prayers are needed. Destiny…is in one’s own hands! But good wishes are… showered by other people. Give me what I want And your wish will be fulfilled. Sir, Sir…just let me see my son once. For one last time sir. Show me my son one last time… Son…are you alright? Yes uncle! What’s going on here? I fail to understand. Forget it. Uncle… can you do me…a final favour? Tell me. What is it that you want? [breathing heavily] Everything is going out of control. It’s no longer safe here. Away from all this… let’s go on a vacation. Get the helicopter ready. -Where is he off to?-- -Will he return? Heard he’s run away with all the money in the treasury. - Why are you deserting us Oh Lord?-- He will not betray us. He is our God! He will never return. He’s run away with all the wealth. -He has gone.-- -Will he ever come back? He will never betray us! Not sure where he is lying dead…my son! Vultures must be devouring him… [crying inconsolably] Show me my son once, sir… I want to see my son one last time. Sir..sir! Show me my son once sir! Sir… On one end, KGF is sinking. He took all the wealth and -eloped with the girl-- -No sir! What you are saying is incorrect! Please read out what is written sir. Aye! Go, get back to your work. Is he right? [kids shouting] What are you kids doing? Hey! All of you come here. This is not the way a tiger hunts. How else? Silently in the bush… it hides and waits for its prey. Once the prey nears suddenly it pounces and goes for the jugular. A grip on the neck renders other parts of body useless. It gradually suffocates… [coughs] Some people find solace in braving the storm… You are moving around in disguise. As you all believe… Rocky is not absconding. Then…has he gone to kill Shetty? You don’t spare the rowdies wherever you go… don't think you would spare the rowdies coming in search of you? If Shetty is killed, another will emerge. Why are you here? That’s why… he’s gone to meet Inayath Khaleel! Boss, they are bringing Rocky to you. Let him in! Salaam…Valikum Walaikum Assalam Wa-rehamatullahi wa-barkatahu My country teaches to respect all religions! In my own city, you booked all the rooms at my hotel to gain my attention. I admire your style! You have travelled far… to die! Am here to get you business. Business…what business? Your gold moves from Africa to Dubai and from Dubai to India. Double risk! I’ll take delivery directly in Africa. Risk is all mine. Will buy unlimited quantity. Deal? The offer is very good. But you are late. Would have probably considered if you had come earlier. On one side the government has fallen… What next sir? Next…Ramika Sen will take oath as next Prime Minister of India and… KGF will end. and on the other side… he is moving towards KGF And you are here like a coward. You have nothing now! You have lost everything. Atleast you should have made a couple of friends. I have made friends…all over Hindustan. What will I answer them? Uncle can you help me with one last task? Tell me. What do you want? Which gun is that? I want the same that I wanted 20 years ago! The WORLD….. When I decided to take over Bombay I have dug their graves and built tombs. I have etched their names! Just mark the dates uncle! The time has come! Give sweets to the kids. [indistinct laughter] Hey, whom are you stopping? Remove it. Now! What is it called? Kalashnikov. Kalash… Hey…where are you going? [muffled voices] Boss! Boss, we have lost the west coast! Rocky has killed them all! Kalashnikov! Don’t know about his whereabouts, but he will attack you next! This story is written in blood. It can’t continue with ink. If it has to continue… it has to be only with blood! I don’t need anyone’s friendship. No one can endure my enmity! Let’s do business! Offer closes soon! He went to Inayath Khalil and struck a business deal. And then he took back the west coast? With style! Hmm! Hello. There was a call. The trucks…have to be prepared to leave for Varca. But there…in KGF Isn't Adheera waiting? He's back again? [men laughing] Gun! [distinct laughter] Rocky went to Dubai for two reasons. What’s the other reason? He had gone there with enough money But wasn’t that an advance for the gold Inayath Khalil was sending? No! Then what was it for? KALASHNIKOV… Tch…tch! Violence…Violence I don't like it. I avoid… but Violence likes me! I can't avoid. When two stones rub against each other, it creates a forest fire. Similarly in a war between two people… their followers also perish. What do you call that? Collateral damage! So… in life, it is important to befriend the right people and choose your battles wisely. and most importantly, to choose your life partner. You want to choose my girl! I understand what your problem is guys… Your long years of labour is brushed aside suddenly by an outsider… I understand. What did you say? The one who just took one step forward? In a clock, the big hand takes 60 steps to complete an hour…but the small hand needs to take just one step! And I have taken that ONE step. The range of the game has changed. In this game of Snake and Ladders, Mongoose has entered the fray! I will let you go. But remember this… No more haggling over territories henceforth. The world…is MY territory! He had such a phenomenal rise that no one even dared to confront him right? Gravitational power. Gravitational power? Oh yes…gravitational power! Don't get confused. There are two types. In Newton's gravity apples fall down. In Rocky's gravity… people go up! Hey Anil…what are you doing? The no confidence motion will begin now by show of hands. Daya…want a drink? What happened? Whoever is healthy…raise you hands. Hey, he is playing a game. The game played by the kids. Hop skip and jump All against. Be careful! Raising hand without thinking is injurious to health. They first draw the boxes and then play with stones within them. But he… throws the stone wherever he wants and then draws the box around it. The no confidence motion held today resulted in unanimously favouring the ruling party. This government will certainly continue to be in power. The fish nowadays, seem to be swallowing the baiters. People holding the bait? Don't tear off that big piece. If its not removed the pain will worsen sir. Let the pain shoot up…that’s what I want! This pain reminds me of him everyday. Remove the remaining small pieces! [people wailing] Between the cries of pain and death… silently there stood… a mountain of hope!

But there was one person only one person who could bring him and KGF…down! I I… Ramika Sen do swear in the name of God and solemnly affirm that to the Constitution of India… We need to fire the Home Minister. Madam! he has huge support of other people madam. then I think we need to fire the entire cabinet. I will bear…true faith and allegiance. I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India. As the Prime Minister of the Union… Are you trying tell me how to run this country? Of course not! I will faithfully… and with a clear conscience… discharge the duties. Fearing her, every government office worked beyond its capabilities. She was ruthless… she was unforgiving… she was a Dictator! She was here to bring hope… and she was here… to bring a change. -OK OK…Oh?-- -Madam has come. Madam…madam! I'm trying to meet you for the last few days Ah Yes Raghavan. Kalraji was mentioning… Heard there is a problem in your state Karnataka -Yes madam, regarding that-- -Ah Kalraji Haven't we stationed our Special Forces in Karnataka? -Yes madam-- -Do one thing. -Send them to this…KGF-- -Sure madam. -That should handle your problem-- -No No! No ma'am! -I want to talk to you about KGF ma’am-- -May be later Raghavan. Madam, I want to talk to you about Rocky! I have bigger national issues to deal with Raghavan. I don’t have time for small time criminals. This is a state matter and they will handle it. No! No! Just five minutes ma’am. Please ma'am! Ramika! For the past 25 years now… I have been studying KGF. In anticipation that someone like you would come, assess him and take action. Give me ten minutes…I will explain. Not just in Karnataka… he operates across 21 states and nine union territories. He is the biggest criminal. He is the biggest businessman. This is the biggest national issue and only you can handle it ma'am. Rocky is never seen anywhere Until now, not even a single photo of him is available. But his name is known all around. Ramesh! Madam…he owns many planes and hundreds of boats. control over all the ports. Along with Bombay Refinery he has access to all the big jewellers of the country. -Where is he from? -Bombay. Information about him is very limited. But he went through lot of struggles earlier on. They hit him…as he was a newbie in town. Hit him when he ate… hit him when he slept This place is mine! Hit him when he looked them in the eye and when he retorted. Hit him when he rebelled. But one fine day… he hit back! From then on, no one dared to… oppose him! The special forces you sent… are no match for him. Why? He has… a very big army. In the surroundings areas, for around 1.5 million people he is God! Before we break the barriers to reach him… we have to get past these 1.5 million people. They’ll get killed… or they will kill! But they will never let any harm befall Rocky! Go back! Go back! He started from the shores of Bombay took control of KGF and grew multifold. He seized the entire country! But until now… no one knows what he has done to that place. Because forget about going there by road, he didn’t even allow commercial flights to fly over KGF. But…recently we have received a photo from a MIG-23 Airforce jet doing training drills over KGF. This is what…they have sent. History tells us… that powerful people… come… from powerful places! -Is that…? -Yes ma’am. That is… Rocky's… KGF! History… was wrong. Powerful people… make places… powerful! Claims he's a journalist. Was clicking photos inside. We've caught him. So you are…Rocky? The world may turn a blind eye towards your atrocities. But I will write about you… and reveal your true colors! Say it again… The world may turn a blind eye towards your atrocities. But I will write about you… and reveal your true colors! Courage comes due to two reasons. One reason is madness… the other is honesty. Madness is seen all the time. Honesty is never ever seen. See… H-O-N-E-S-T-Y. I don’t believe in history. What has occurred is different… from what has been written. Don’t heed to hearsay and write. Experience it and write. It has its own value! Hey, give him everything he requires. Bear in mind… you are now in this journey with me. Close down all the state borders! Find his warehouses! My journey is always a One-Way! Arrest his associates! Raid the whole of India if you have to. There will be Ups and Downs U-turns and Dead Ends. Raghavan! I give you full authority But the speed will… never decelerate. Bring him down! So… Fasten your seat belts! -Kalraji -Yes madam. Do you… have any details about the raid? I'll find out madam. Every, every raid is a failure. There is an information leak And there is an informer in this office! Go to hell! Damn it! -Hey! The motor has stopped working. -There is a power failure. Mallamma! You said you will treat me royally. Its very sultry! Go get a hand-fan. Nothing is in their control. Police is here…pack up! [crowd shouting] Hey Mallamma! Take care of the fries. Hey…run…run! Damn it! They have sealed the state borders. Our warehouses have been seized. What else have you got? M134…its called 1000wala. Once lit…it keeps on burning. Inayath Khalil has called to check on the status. Sir, MMG…German make. Sprays bullets like water from a spray can. Umm… Have to tread cautiously with Ramika Sen. Otherwise… Sir, I have another gun. DUSHKA…Soviet make. It mounts on a big tripod. We call it…the BIG MOMMA! When BIG MOMMA yells tremors are felt all over. Rather than giving a flying kiss… I prefer to hug and cuddle. Just now in Bangalore, there has been a raid. As we had prior information goods were shifted elsewhere. They were 80 in number…but insufficient. All they got was… a single Gold biscuit! Where is it? The goods have been safely moved to Mysore. Not that! Where is that one biscuit? Did you mention the name of your BIG MOMMA? One…Two…One…Two… This fanfare is overboard. Given that it’s the CBI, to catch a petty thief they put the whole department in action. Hey boy! Let me clear your old dues. No worries sir! Will pick it up in the evening! Finally, all they could find was one stone. What was his name? Not sure about his full name. But the file mentions Bombay Shooter sir. Sir, sir…what was the name again? Hey…go do your work! Sir, please tell sir! Eh…he is a native of your village. Name sounded like… Bairya. Sir…do you have any of his belongings? Hey, you too! Enough of this hype! Look…what I have got!. Sir…please clear my dues sir! Hey, you said by evening. No sir. Please pay up now. -Not sure who will survive till evening! -Aah! Here… Hey, I haven’t finished yet! Forget the tea. Am worried about my glass! Hey, who are you? Bairya!…Raja Krishnappa Bairya! My village calls him… ROCKY BHAI! Salaam Rocky Bhai! [frightened voice] [frightened voices] Yes sir… you wanted to test it in the field. Where sir? Sir…where are you off to? [coughs] [breathing heavily] Ah…is this the field? Run…run! [breathing heavily] BIG MOMMA! No… BIG DADDY! We have seen enough wars in our lifetime! Let’s treat this peacefully. Send a delegation to Burma! Excuse me madam. I apologize. But CBI director has some news! Am glad that our raid was not successful! Just for 400gms of gold… he destroyed the entire police station. If it was 400kgs… imagine Bangalore's… Cancel the Burma delegation. Call the General… The Indian Government, managing the clashes in Burma peacefully… in a surprise move, has struck down the perpetrators using military force. Our correspondent Chetan Sharma is ready to interview the Prime Minister. As per United Nations, the Burma matter could have been resolved peacefully. But your action was too harsh. Wasn’t it? Why did you do that? Burma was just an example to let everyone know. Hmm! -There will be no more tolerance. -Hmm… I also have forces! Super! Didn't you understand? We call them the Army… the Navy… and the Airforce! She is infact talking to me! We shall seek and destroy! Now we are neither in power… nor in the opposition! Madam is here… She wont sit idle. Inform Rocky! The warning that the Prime Minister gave Rocky was like… adding fuel to fire! Rocky was now about to execute… his biggest plan! Block the entire consignment. Yes, you heard it right.. stop it. Don’t ask the reason. Do as you are told. Stop it everywhere. That’s the order! The black market for gold has closed in the entire country. Why has Rocky stopped it now? Why is he hoarding so much of gold? Boss! Rocky has stopped the supply of gold across Hindustan. -What if he goes against you… -Urgh! Don't assume that he is doing this fearing the Prime Minister. No one can read Rocky's mind. But by blocking gold, he would have planned something big. First, lets think how we can stop him! There is only one option now… Adheera! Approach him now! Adheera… known to bend mountains… Earlier you were hiding from Garuda… now from Rocky! In two years, he has amassed gold equal to what we did in 25 years. We are unaware of the happenings and the security set up there. Not even sure how the place looks… Its impossible to set foot in his KGF. He has taken your position and ruling. -And here you are in a remote cave-- -Ahh Mellow down. My head is pounding. You are right. No one can set foot in KGF now! Vanaram and his guards will not let anyone near Rocky. He will have more guards and ammunition in his barracks. Its tough. But I will trounce him right there in front of everyone… in the same mines! There are two ways to get there. One is through the East Gate… and the other is West Gate. Both gates are highly secured. We need a third route. The mine tunnels stretches… several kilometres long… right out of KGF. And that's our third route! How do you all of this? Sparing him was a big mistake. But he sparing me… was his last mistake. No matter what, he should not live! For that in the last two years in KGF, I have used the people working in all departments and created this map. They are of no use now. GUN! [frightened voices] Hey… Silence! Head is splitting! Turn the gun around. This scene is for you. In case you don’t find the third route you will join the crowd. Adheera has given up bending mountains. Now he demolishes them. [frightened voices] Strike! There’s water logging in the 7th Mine. Taking time to pump out water. There's no time. Hurry up! Work should not get affected. Also, in yesterday’s blast in Mine Four, eighteen people were injured. Not sure if they are able to work again! Tch…pay their dues and relieve them. -Get able men and get the work done. -OK. Or take them to the deep Mine and shoot them. Just like Garuda did. You are no different from Garuda! Greed has taken over you. You are rebelling against the country and also her! But your work…should not stop! She will destroy your KGF! She will thwart your desires! Followers who trust you will be on the streets. But your work should go on! You are the one who freed them and you are the one who will hang them. But your work should go on! What’s your intention? Tell me! Why are you doing all this? Brother…give me a bottle. Hey…clear your old dues first! Clear his old dues and give him another bottle.

Look…my son is now doing fine. Now I’ll get him married…lavishly! Make sure the surveillance continues -round the clock and don’t tell… -Sir! We got him! Where's the Prime Minister now? We investigated Rocky’s financial transactions. Millions of accounts have been opened in the name of common people. All these funds are being transferred to one Trust account. The Trust has only one Trustee madam. Of course! -Good job-- -Thank you madam. -We got him. -Ya Find the evidence linking Rocky to the Trust Fund. File charges against him! Let’s get him arrested and parade him in public. Yes madam. Its been 25 years since we opened Mine number three. We've dug a mile deep but found only stones. No sign of gold yet. Close it and shift the workers elsewhere. Hello! If there is no teacher in the class kids create all sorts of nuisance. Same situation in Delhi. For the Principal’s position, shall we apply in your name? We have issued notices to the respective banks. We also contacted other financial institutions. Madam, someone is here to see you. Not now Arjith. No more appointments for today please. Madam, its… Rocky! Hi! I am Jimmy Carter. Rocky! I am the CEO of Denver Steel, Texas. Sir, madam will see you now. What is this CEO, dear? Hmm…Boss of Bosses sir! Same Same! I am also…CEO! Oh! wonderful…which one? India! It’s a small world, isn't it? Can make it spin with our fingers! I also have a similar one made of gold. Its stand too is made of gold. The table underneath, also made of gold! Seems you own a lot of gold! Hmm? Do you want me to clear the country’s debt? I'll clear it! Is this a bribe…or a threat? Tch tch! Not at all. Am here to lodge a complaint. Complaint? Against whom? Myself! Madam, I have decided to come clean! In this unjust world I believe you are the one who can help me get justice! In the name of Limestone Corporation in KGF am involved in illegal mining. I'm also into money laundering using a Trust fund. All the details… are in this. Get me arrested on these charges madam! Madam! Please don’t accept that complaint! Why? Madam, please try and understand! Do not accept that complaint. Are you also a beneficiary of that fund? He is a beneficiary… and I am too. Along with us also are the 200 members of our party. I said you know madam! Unjust world! Wont let you do good Wont let me be good! Bet you feel the urge to shoot me at point blank. But, you cannot you know why? Rules, Regulations, Elections, People, Demography! This Demography is a farce! Who needs it madam? People need food and shelter. Isn’t it sir? Huh! Yes sir! They will sell the country for a packet of cheap liquor. Madam for you it is Of the people, For the people, By the people. For me it is… BUY the people! To nab a criminal like me you have to get out of the system, break the rules, think like a criminal and then… it just takes two minutes. Never mind I will withdraw my complaint. Ma’am, there’s an elderly teacher, my close acquaintance. He wants to be er…a Union Minister. Please note it down madam. Requesting this madam. If my man is around… can avoid my frequent trips to Delhi. Please oblige… A falling star…always shines bright! Heard you are a good businessman and a sharp one at that. but you are also a criminal. But some day you will err. And that day… I will strip you off everything… your people your gold your fame your KGF and all that you desire! This is a not a warning… this is my promise! I generally try to avert wars. if I cannot… I always win! -Raghavan Sir! -Ha? Heard you were looking for my photo? Do you want one in this classy suit? See you soon! He is right. Criminals always think ahead. Maybe I should get ahead of him. I guess now I also have to work outside of the system. Got a call from Delhi. Adheera… has found another route. Hey What happened? Nothing. Hey…what happened? I had…a bad dream. In that…you… I am a bad dream myself. What can happen to me? I missed you so much. Don’t leave me alone. Rocky’s funeral procession is about start. -Atleast a shroud to be sent from our end. -Yes boss. The route you asked for. If you dig here… you will reach the Mine…from there… you will directly reach him! [loud laughter] Old methods begets old results. Lets look to innovate. Get the turbines. -They are not available here -Get it from US… What happened? I am unwell. Let me see…its nothing. Don't worry, go home. I will send the doctor. I don’t feel like eating anything. Who’s that cook? Ask him to cook properly. There wont be any problem from tomorrow. Fathima aunty has advised not to walk briskly. Fine, take it easy for some more days. I feel like eating something sour and tangy. I'll get the entire market home. Eat all you want. What's wrong with you? Eh…Come on uncle. Mother is coming… Wish all the good things come your way. Let all the bad things… befall me! [distinct laughter] They are attacking Rocky… Our guards are getting killed. Aah my God! Through which Mine did they all enter? Third Mine. Hey Hey…don’t go my son. Don’t! Listen to me. Everything will end. I beg you…Everything will be destroyed! Everything is lost! Gone…everything is washed away! The war is over. Enemies are all vanquished! Where is he going now? One more remaining… I'll tell you the story of a village. One day a few dacoits came to the village. They attacked and captured a house. Neighbours did not bother because it was not their problem. Then the dacoits captured the entire neighbourhood. Even then, the rest of the village did not react because it was not their problem! Eventually the dacoits seized the entire village. Those Captors…are akin to the British. And that village…India! We ignored them thinking that it was not our problem. That is why they ruled over us for 250 years. You see everyone… paid attention to the revolving top but no one noticed the string that made the top revolve. There was a mastermind behind all of this. And Rocky was going to get rid of that mastermind! [indistinct chatter] And now there is a similar person. He will take over the entire country! But I will not allow him to prevail because, I am going to make it my problem! Just by a single signature of mine if I can bring him down then… I…am ready to resign from the post of Prime Minister immediately! [frightened voices] When Suryavardhan handed over KGF to Garuda… Adheera… the unseen hand started to conspire. People assumed that Adheera attacked Garuda. But that hand was pulling the strings. Garuda attacked Adheera… but Adheera survived. The same hand was at play here. When Rocky took control of KGF Adheera was called in and he was shown the third Mine by the same unseen hand… Its been twenty five years since Mine Three has opened. Got a call from Delhi. The loss of power in Delhi and Shetty getting cosier with Inayath Khalil. The hand executed it all. The same hand led Rocky to KGF. The person who can bring down the mammoth is in Bombay. ROCKY! Now Rocky is after this hand…to sever it! I told you earlier there was only one person who could bring down KGF and that was Rocky…himself! No one shall ever read or write anything about him. His name shall be erased from the pages of history. Whoever tries to intervene, get rid of them. If need be, eliminate them all! Get ready… I am enforcing the army… and signing the death warrant of the biggest criminal in India! The civilians are not engaging. It looks like they are all evacuating KGF! Approaching the mansion… Reminder… Rocky must be taken dead or alive. Armed forces entering the mansion Be cautious for resistance! We are outside Rocky’s room… We are breaking the door… The door has opened. The forces are going inside. Sir! Rocky is not here.The room is empty. Repeat that Rocky is not here sir. There is no sign of the gold too sir. Where has he gone? This is Captain Suryaprathap. Commanding officer of INS Indrajit. Doing training drills in the Indian ocean. Yes Captain. Heard that you are in search of a criminal called Rocky. -Yes Captain. -We got a fax. Rocky is here… in the Indian Ocean! That day, the amount of gold Rocky possessed was bigger than anyone in the world. There was only one place to hide the gold. He started to that place. Captain…he is most wanted criminal. He should not escape at any cost. Sorry to say this Major. But I don’t think that he is trying to escape. What are you saying? Yes, we have received the Fax from within… Rocky’s ship! He is headed directly at us. He has sent the same fax to Americans and Indonesians. Turn around the ship! They are also going towards Rocky’s ship. Change the channel. You are about to enter international waters from the Indian waters. Turn off your engines and prepare for surrender… I repeat…turn off your engines and prepare for surrender. All the civilians have been cleared from KGF. The armed forces are also marching out of KGF now. Begin secondary incursion. It’s a GO for MIG-23s. They have taken off from base camp. This is your last warning! Turn off your engines and prepare for surrender. Or we will fire! MIG-23s are closing in on our target. ETA two minutes. The bombers are over KGF. Waiting for your final orders madam. I repeat! We are waiting for your final orders for the strike madam. Rocky is not responding to the warnings Major. The US Navy and Indonesian Navy are closing in. We are waiting for your orders. Orders madam… Do it! Doctor! Doctor! What happened? Seems like pneumonia! What didn't you come earlier? Also you have come in pouring rain. Such carelessness towards the kids. You think you are all qualified doctors? It has widely spread. If you don’t take your son to the city he wont survive! -Hey! -Ah? Am here for my son's treatment… and you are commenting on his life? He closes his eyes only when he hears my lullaby. Neither do you have right to talk about his life… nor does God! That’s not what he meant. Don’t despair. Your son will have a long life. Despite being slaves, some people don't mind living long. But some others… however short their life is, they want to live like an Emperor! Even if he dies today, I'll conclude that he didn’t have the ability to keep my words and forget him! Otherwise, as long as he lives, in this unjust world to fulfill my dreams, he should be an Emperor! ♪ Remember these words Even in your last breath ♪ Fire! ♪ Its always the path of thorns You tread in this world ♪ ♪ Sail through safely even If the world is in flames ♪ Finally, when the day of his death arrives ♪ Be persistent and stand strong To face the world… ♪ no one will get a chance to lift his coffin!

I will write a book about him and let the whole world know about him. However long it takes, I will collect each and every evidence and narrate with proof. What do you want to say sir? If he were alive today… it wouldn't be a story of mythical creatures and warriors from ancient times or as a story of historical wars and achievements. A mother from a small village, the story of her determination would have been his narration. He had written down how he wanted to die. But I will write about how he lived his life. There is no history of water giving rise to fire. But from the tears of this mother a fire was born… and so was the legacy of ROCKY!

Rocky deliberately went to the same place in the Indian ocean and made the Indian Navy fire at him. That's because the ocean's depth is 20000ft. We cannot extract anything from such depths. The matter that we fail to understand is why Americans and Indonesians chased Rocky. I am John Booker. CIA…United States of America. This is the signed document by the Director of the CIA. For the extradition of the criminal named Rocky. From the year 1978 and till 1981 Rocky has committed several crimes across 16 countries. Including USA. This is the file listing all his crimes in the last three years. I would advise you to look at it very carefully.
