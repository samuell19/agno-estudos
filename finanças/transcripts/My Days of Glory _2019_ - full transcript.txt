I was opening the door and I smelled gas, so I shut it at once. I phoned you guys in case it exploded. Sir, tell me more. - What's going on? - Sorry to bother you. - The gas is on. - The gas? What floor? On the 5th floor. Show me. It's the 2nd window on the right. My girlfriend... - She had to go... - The gas is on? Yes, my girlfriend had to go. She's a pediatrician. Put up the ladder. 5th floor, right-hand window. It's dangerous. There's a lot of gas. Cordon off the area. Come on, guys. It's an emergency. Ready to go up the ladder. What the hell? Get down from there! No saucepan, sir! What? My girlfriend said it was an emergency, because... The gas was on. She's a pediatrician. No saucepan. I don't understand. - He lied. - How strange. - OK, move out. - Yes, sir. MY DAYS OF GLORY Oh, fuck. Oh, shit! Excuse me. Is my eye OK? Anything wrong with my eye? You have a stye. Sorry. - Huh? - A stye. Is it very visible? Well, yeah, it's there. Sorry. Must be the stress. Excuse me. I forgot to read my emails this morning. The casting is for what? Can't you see? It's a film on the army. What genre? What period is it? You get the synopsis and everything by email. Didn't you get it? Yes, it's on my email, but my battery's dead, so... Can I have a look at yours, please? - A quick look? - No. I need to reread it and really memorize it. Go on. Help me out. That's the army mentality. Nope. You could ask him. So much for solidarity. - Can you lend me your script? - No way. Sorry. Jeez... Thanks! I don't believe it! De Gaulle! Fascinating. As you should know, we're casting for Charles De Gaulle. It's a film about his youth. It's a film about his doubts and hopes, his moments of joy and despair. His early days with the Jesuits, meeting Yvonne... Do you know a bit about De Gaulle? Interested in history? Sure. Know him well or not? Sure. You say "Sure''. - No, I mean, yes. - OK. It's important to Gerd as it's a big film. He wants people to be committed to the project. - I'm fascinated by De Gaulle. - OK, fine. Oh, one thing: Gerd only speaks German. He can't speak English or French. Speak German? Russian? So, go through me. I'm Marc. Lift up the sign, please. Lift it up. Thanks. Introduce yourself. Hello, I'm Adrien, 27. I'm an actor. I did quite a few films when I was little. Did you see any of them? Do you take drugs? I smoke some crack on a Saturday night, but is that...? I'm not serious. A joke. Look at the camera and stop joking. - OK? - Sorry. Thanks. Hold your hands up. Show me your hands. OK, turn them around. The other side. Why? Put your hands down. I see you haven't done a film for 6 years, Adrien. Why's that? What happened? Well, there's a recession on! Turn sideways. - Turn sideways. - I was joking. It's a bit hard to explain, but... I couldn't find any interesting projects and the system is complicated. I needed to focus and... Time went by quicker than expected... And I didn't find... anything. Anyway... OK. Can you turn back? Look at the camera, please. Who won World War II? France did. - Not single-handed. - No, with the Allies. The Americans and Brits, but mainly France. The Germans fought well! Happy birthday! Nice cake. Blow 'em out! To Charles De Gaulle! Great. - You didn't blow hard enough. - They lit up again! - That's crazy! - Try harder. Is that marzipan? - What's this shit? - Try harder. I found them. Funny, isn't it? Yeah... Shit, I've broken something. Ouch! Happy birthday! OK, honey? Did you burn yourself? - Will you cut it, Bertrand? - OK. - Oops! - Bertrand! Shit! What did you do? - It was the table. - Jeez! - Maybe we can save it. - Yeah. Dad, can't you be more careful? It was less than 3 seconds. The dog mustn't eat it. He'll have a hypo. Call Antoine! Don't call Antoine, 'cause he ate a bit of cake! Stop treating him like a human! Christ! Hasn't Bertrand changed a lot? No, why? Doesn't he look younger? You call that looking younger? Hi, Antoine! Sorry to disturb you. Hey, that's what I'm there for. He's eaten quite a lot of cake and maybe a couple of candles. He just needs a laxative. Jacob! We're late! Get up! Let's go. Wake up, you filthy parasite! We're late. Where's your schoolbook? Is that it? What time is it? I'll be back in an hour to work with Foussard. - Less 4,200 in February? - Yes. March was better. I read that soon you won't be able to smoke on terraces. So, go smoke on the terrace! We won't be able to smoke outside, like in Japan. It's stable, compared to last year. What do you think? - 4,000... - You don't care? - Go outside, man, please. - OK, OK. We need more Post-it notes. Make a note to get some. No, there's nothing I can do. I'm sure we can work something out. You'll be closed all weekend. - What'll I do? - I can't help you, sir. There must be a solution. It's nearly the weekend. What'll I do without a credit card? Sir, please... We can't help you. This is taking the piss. It's really aggressive. You can't... It's a court decision. You had a letter. - But... - Check your mail. OK, but couldn't you have warned me? You take advantage of the slightest weakness. I've been a customer for years and everything went fine. I want a card now! That's enough, I want one now. No! Give me a card now. - You... - I want one. You're shitting on me! Is that how you... uh... OK, Martine? Yes, everything's fine. Taking the piss? No, no... Don't you think it's a bit much? There are rapists, pedophiles, burglars... Know what it costs to send a fire truck? It's our tax money... What? - What did you say? - Nothing. Theft, extortion, robbery? Public exhibitionism. I'm joking! Last time! - Thanks. That much?! - What? Well, it's... Nothing. I left my keys at home, so I told the fire department I'd left the gas on. Not bad! And you? What girls do to pay for their studies. I'm joking. I'm not serious! Very funny. Léa? What the hell? - Hello. - Hello. You are? Her father. Do you have some ID, please? Thanks. There's just a fine this time. Make sure your daughter doesn't do it again. Sign here, please. No... Oh, no! Why are you here? No, why are you here? To stay for a few days so I wouldn't disturb you. I have bedbugs. They're using really toxic chemicals. So, as this place is empty... You should've thought of that. It's my office now. Why do you need an office? I'm working again. Where will I sleep? Ask your mother. Right, well... Little Thingy Get up, honey! A patient's coming in 5 minutes. C'mon, get up! What? What is it? A patient's coming in 5 minutes. Hurry up. A patient this early? Must be an incurable depressive. - Get up! - Roger! Come on! We'll discuss that next week. We'll discuss it next week, Mrs. Lembrez. I'm starting to understand things. I've noticed that women are always gossiping, chatting about shopping and kids. Men always want to set the world to rights. Every discussion has to lead to something bigger. You see relations with men as intense? Yes, well, intellectually speaking, you know? Don't you think it has to do with forbidden desire? How so? - See you next week. - Thanks. OK, honey? Hey! Isn't that male friendship thing psychobabble bullshit? What's that about gays? First of all, it's not "psychobabble bullshit". Men need a virile friendship, because they're afraid of their homosexuality, their feminine side. - Women aren't. - Oh, the feminist! Well, take you, for example... Unlike your pals Pierre and Georges who are very tender, they touch. That's not true. They don't touch. They do. Whereas you're very distant, you're much colder, you have castration anxiety. - A narcissistic form... - What do you mean? - Well, I mean... - No, you're insinuating things. No, I'm not. I'm just saying that if you accepted... You think I'm gay? - I don't know. No, but if... - You do. No. When you accept this tenderness, you'll be able to have... a girlfriend, for example. How do you know I don't have one? - Oh? - Yeah. There may be no privacy here, but I'm entitled to some discretion. You have a girlfriend? What's her name? What does she do? I won't say a word. Come on! Shit, I gotta go. You tell me, OK? - I don't know. - Sweetie! That's tenderness, see? Have a nice day, you little fag! - Foussard? - Yes. - Concentrate. - OK. Stay focused. We'll win this match. Victory is ours. There's no way we can lose. No chance. We play as a team. - We play together. - We don't argue. Right. We talk calmly. C'mon, Georges. Center. C'mon, Foussard! Scene 32. Charles comes back from a mission. On furlough, he meets Mireille and falls in love with her. His parents want him to marry into the Ventoux family. They have money. De Gaulle has nobility. And Mireille is simple and poor. - OK? Adrien? - Yes. Over to you. Action. - Now? - Go on. Yeah? OK. Mother, Father, I'm prey to doubts. My feelings for Yvonne have changed. In Poland, during my mission, another woman's savage beauty struck me hard. That's absurd, Charles. We've found someone. Don't hurt us, son. What did you do with this girl? Don't you like Yvonne anymore? Ventoux biscuits... - Hi. - Ah, Ulysse! This is Ulysse. I couldn't find a docking point. - Claire. - I'm playing Charles' brother. - Hello. - Monique. I'll call you Mother! - Hey, man. - Hey, I'm so sorry. That's OK. Captain, sorry. Was it OK? As we were interrupted... Let's carry on. You carry on. - When he sits down. - Xavier, your brother. - Adrien. - Hi, I'm Ulysse. The introductions are done. OK, Adrien. Sorry, I'm parched. - When you're ready. - Yeah. Go on. From "Ventoux biscuits". I'm to marry into Ventoux biscuits? Listen, Marc... Sorry, but we haven't discussed the payrate. My lawyer is pressurizing me to clarify the situation. Can he contact you? It's too soon, Adrien. We're just trying things out. No, let's not spoil it. It's a laboratory, Gerd's experimenting. - I'm not asking... - Of course not. I hope you're not! I'll yell at my lawyer. I'll tell him it's too soon. Don't mention it to Gerd. Always go through me. Yeah, sure. Don't talk money to Gerd. Of course not. Whatever you do. Shush, don't say a word. Hi there. - Sorry I'm late. - No problem. Not too cold? No, I'm fine. - Good to see you. - Is that where we're going? You don't want to? It's a shitty idea in this weather. It's a great idea. I've never done it. It's cool. - Let's go. - Yeah. Pity it's such shitty weather. Isn't it pretty? You can see the whole of Paris. So, are you a student? No, I'm an actor. - Oh, wow! - Yeah... Well, I'll be going. I'll take the subway. Oh, OK. Well, sorry about the Ferris wheel. It was a crappy idea. It was cool. No, it's raining. We should've had a coffee. See you tomorrow? We can get a coffee out of the wind and rain. No, I can't, tomorrow. When can you? Well, come to the party. It's a "bitch and prick" party. - Oh, sure. - Yeah? See you. What's wrong with you? It must be a physical problem. Maybe a torn muscle or ligament? Is that possible? Does it hurt? Not physically. But it's hard on my morale. It's... It's worrying. When did you last have sex? Hard to say... - It was... - Show me the maggot. - There's... - No, there's no-one. Just me. Right... Well... Oh, I see! What is it? - Oh, OK! - What? No, I'm joking. - Have you tried to get aroused? - Yeah. Do you masturbate to porn films? - Can I pull 'em up? - Yes. Sometimes, like everyone else, but it has no effect. For example, last time I was with a girl, we kissed... It should've been instant, but nothing happened. Nothing stirred in my pants. Maybe she didn't appeal. She did. That's the problem. OK, get dressed. There's no such thing as impotence at 27 years of age. If you've not radically changed anything in your life, it's in the mind. What about therapy? No need, my mom's a shrink, that's more than enough. You discuss your erection with your mother? No. Brother, I've rarely seen such an elegant man. You're very handsome. Our family doesn't lie. I'm not. Promise me one thing. If you don't return, send back victory for France. I'll be back. Be strong. I don't let anyone tread on my toes. I know. Be strong, brother. Look after Mother and Father. I'll look after Mother... and our disabled cousin. Come on, guys, carry on. Do you want a coffee? No... I tend to prefer tea. No, I tend... I tend to prefer coffee. Tea has no effect on me. I know war. War is like hunting. But in war, rabbits shoot. For that extremely simple reason, I wish... - OK? - Yeah. - To the General! - Yeah. And to you! Cheers! Bravo. Good, huh? It's strong. Lots of vodka, little tomato. It's normal to me. Well, you drink all day. I'm happy, not drunk. Because you're drunk! You don't know what I do in my room. - You don't seem to make much progress. - I'm working! - I'm working. - Yeah, very hard! You daydream, more like! Oh, Pétain! Oh, man, Pétain! 'Night, Roger! Oh, for fuck's sake! So? - What's up? - Will you be long? Couldn't you digest your dinner? Tummy trouble? It's nice that you came back to their apartment... It was now or never, because... with all that's happening... this business... of divorce... What? It's not that they... I mean, they did well to... They finally... made their minds up... It's a good thing. I mean... Well, I don't know... If you... want to... to talk about it... Take all that off, Georges. Look at the state of you! You look like a psychic, not a whore. What a pain in the ass. Sort yourself out. - You could've worn makeup. - Look, I'm not a whore. Well, you know... - You're... C'mon. - Am I OK? - Look happy. - I'm nervous now. Smile. Stop drinking the fuckin' vodka! - Hello. - We're here for the party. Whose birthday is it? - Eric? - Eric, yeah. No, mine. I'm Jérôme. Happy birthday, Jérôme! Léa invited me to the pitch and brick... bitch and prick party. - She's gone. - Already? - Yep. - We got booze. It's for under 18s only. You gotta be joking. Fuckin' hell! OK, hon? Yeah. Where's Dad? He must be working upstairs. Did you do anything fun tonight? Oh, lots of stuff. Did you see the girl you told me about? Yeah... Really? So? Tell me more. No, I'm going to bed. Come on, tell your ol' mom! Hello? Yeah, well... Yeah. I've just been rehearsing for my next film. Yeah... Look, I'm busy. I'm already committed to one project. I'll let you work. - Revising hard? - Yeah. How funny! I didn't expect to see you. - How's it going? - Great. You? Sorry about that party. - Yes, sorry. - No problem. I understand. Our costumes were lousy. We went on to a big party, so... It wasn't a problem. We had... Anyway, you weren't there. How funny... I've been given a bottle of champagne for a role. - I'll open it. - Right now? In New York, champagne coffee is in. They'll throw us out. No, they won't. No-one's ever been thrown out of a bar for champagne. You can bring a bottle... What the fuck? Oh, I'm really sorry. Sorry. - You're making it worse. - Sorry. It's not good enough. I want you to leave. - You too. - We don't know him! - All of you. - We don't know him! Well, see you. - I'll call you, OK? - Bye. Hello. What a nice little gathering. Hello. This is Adrien, my son. He has bedbugs in his place. It only happens to him! So, he's come back to live with his mommy. Huh, honey? Carry on with your crazy story. Oh, it's fantastic! Scientists in California, I think... I'll be going. There's data from the whole world. Something like that... What does your mom charge per hour? It depends on the client. Why? I'm thinking of trying therapy again. - Really? - I mean, really try. Why? You seem balanced at the moment. So-so. Do you think you really need it? Yes, well... It's not just about balance. I can feel I need to talk, see? Not tell intimate stuff to people who can't give you an opinion. - Who don't care. Right. And I have lots to say, things I'm obsessed about, you know, and it's making my life a misery. No, you can. - You... - Go ahead. - You don't mind? - No. No. You're not going to talk about me in your sessions. I'm not a source of anxiety. You're in my life. We've been through stuff. - So, it's bound to... - Yes, but... It's not like I was your boyfriend. - I mean... - No, I know. There's nothing to talk about, because we just hang out and chat. No problem. Let's smoke in the consulting room. What's it like, being back home? They're so pleased to see me again. - It's crazy. - I can imagine. - De Gaulle! - Get undressed, Adrien. Do we get changed here? - Don't be shy. - See you. See you. I didn't sleep. - Really? - Too nervous. - Why? - I kept thinking about the script. I thought to myself... The part's yours. Yeah. No-one else could do it. Did you look at my dick? What? - You can look. - I didn't. I can show you. I don't want to see it. I didn't even notice it. You have no tattoos? - I thought about it... - Show me. - Hup! - Fuck! Got a problem with nudity? - Cut it out. - OK, sorry. Don't... Hup! You have a big problem. I do like being naked, but I'm shy, you know. I like being naked... on my own or when I decide. I was joking. I'm off. Marc! Where are you? Gerd? Gaby? These clothes are too big. Georges... - Are you asleep? - Yes. I can't sleep. What's up? I don't know. What's up? Think Léa likes me? Of course she likes you. It's obvious. I try to be funny... I feel a bit uneasy. - You asleep? - Want to know what I think? Do you know the song... by Guy Mardel? "Never Admit." It goes: Never, ever, ever admit Never, ever, ever admit that you love her Once you admit it, there's no desire, no mystery. Whereas the moment before, you know you like each other, you know... it'll happen, but you make it last as long as possible. 'cause that's the most... We may make it last so long, it never happens. 'Evening. Did you call for a nurse? What seems to be the problem? Your thighs hurt, OK. You jumped. I must have... had an effect on you. Is it nice? Oh, I say... I see something interesting moving under that towel. Is my nurse's outfit having an effect on you or is it me? Do you like that? Come on! You're all stiff for me... Fuck! Mom! Where's my tomato shirt? You have it? Can't you wear your own shirts? Oh, yeah. You're right. They're tomatoes. Where are you going? To see a girlfriend. I'll give you your shirt back. Keep it, it's OK. It's OK. 'Night, Dad. Thanks. You OK? Yeah. Great. What're you thinking about? Nothing. I saw you in a film... ''Little Thingy''. It looked good. Yeah, it was. Didn't you do other stuff? I did a few things, but... It was less... It was less striking maybe... Well, you'll do other stuff. Yeah, I know. I'm not really worried. Tell me something. Tell you what? - About you. - Well... When was your first time? I must've been 18 or 19. Really? What? That's really late! No, it's not... Your generation do it early. What was it like? I'm interested. No, cut it out, it's embarrassing! - Asking things like that... - No. - You go first if you're not shy. - OK. I was... I was 13 or 14. It was with my girlfriend Vanille's penfriend. He was called Cooper. - Vanille and Cooper. - Yep. Great! He had a certain something... He was a typical American, you know, with... locks of blond hair in his eyes. That is touching. No, but you know... You know what I mean?! And... There was a party, we were wasted, and... we did it in Vanille's parents' bed. There. Is that all? It was a first time. Nothing special. You're tense, you try to hide your tiny boobs, it goes real fast... Then it's over. A typical first time. Faster! Steer it! When you smile, your dimple is cute. I'm just gonna go to the bathroom. Yeah. What's wrong? Are you OK? How did you do that? Can't you call someone else? Oh, shit, OK. Stay there. Don't move. I'm on my way. What is it? My friend Georges has... caught his hand in a door... He's cut his fingertip off. So I have to go. Can't he go on his own? I have to look after his son Jacob. It's a bit... I really gotta go. I'm off. Thanks for the party. It was really good. You're here? Yeah. Where else? No... Working hard? Yeah, I'm working. - I'm off. - OK. Georges! Great! Thanks. What do I owe you? - 500. - 500 euros? Sorry, I only have 120, I don't have my card... Thanks. Brother! Know why this flag has 3 colors? Hang on. Is that good? - Is it a good likeness? - Super. Look at yourself. Marc... Oh, that's great. Very good. Doesn't it remind you of someone else's moustache? No, it doesn't. It was fashionable back then. - It's very good. - Doesn't it remind you of...? Of? Adrien, that's not funny. Is that because Gerd is German? No, it hadn't occurred to me. Don't tell him I said that. Yes, Mrs. Durupt. Yes... I'll get back to you. Dad, he's annoying me! Stop bugging me! I've done nothing. Look! Oh, shit! Are you OK, Jacob? What happened? - We were playing. - It hurts. Ow, it hurts. - Can I help you? - Yes, hello. For a hard time Go on. Yes, uh... See my friend over there? Yes. Well, he has... How can I put it? He has erectile dysfunction. At his age? I doubt it. It happens. It's happened to him. So I need some... I mean, he needs some Viagra, please. OK... It's very dangerous for the heart. Let's take his blood pressure. - No... - It takes 2 minutes. Sir! - Sir! - Stop. Don't shout. Just say it's for me, OK? - OK, it's for the two of you. - No. I'll get you some. But be aware you're endangering your boyfriend. No problem? - I'll go get it. - Thanks. But he's not my boyfriend. Whatever. - He's a friend. - 30 minutes before penetration, take a tablet and you're off. - OK. - Have fun. - Is that the cream? - It's nothing. Leave that alone. Yes, I need cream for a bump, too. - I'll go get it. - Thanks. Don't make a noise. My mom's staying with me. Your place looks so cool. Yeah. Go in the kitchen. Give me your coat. You ruined my Bloody Adrien recipe! Let's mix it. Fuck! It needs stirring. Try it. It's very good. Delicious. It needs a drop more vodka. You should test it. Go on, have a sip. Seems OK. Smell it. I'm going to... clean up. Where's the bathroom? It's... straight ahead. At the end of the corridor. Keep going. It's probably just stress, that's all. I'll give him a jab. He'll forget all about it. - Oh, not a jab. - It'll be OK. Dad, can you help me with this, please? Anxiety is very common. Look, he's already... reassured, I think. Listen... I can't do it on someone else. Sorry. Can anyone help? I can do it. Hey, you look smart! What's going on? What's with the outfit? Why the suit? Is it for the girl from last night? - Is that it? - No. The one who ate all my tomatoes. - The one from last time? - No. The one you mentioned? So you have a girl? What's her name? Stop it. - You look cute like that. Doesn't he? - Yes. Why are you dressed like that? No reason. We're having lunch with Muriel and Guillaume. - Let's go. - Let's go. So, Mr. Palatine... What's your explanation? No more stamps to reply? No more tickets to come to court? No, I wanted to apologize for my absences, but I couldn't get into my mailbox, but now I'm back and I'd like... to work something out together... Sir, you didn't reply to the summonses. It's a bit late now. Yes, that's what I wanted to say... I'm going to be earning money. I'm an actor, so my income is a bit irregular. But I'm starting a shoot, so I'll be able to pay my debts. I wanted to know how I can get my apartment back. Your apartment was seized, Mr. Palatine. What? It's no longer yours. It'll be sold to pay off your debts. - What? - You're reacting too late. Sign here, please. Wait, there must be a way... It's the law, Mr. Palatine. There's no going back on it. OK, Adrien? Sorry, I'm a bit late. - Didn't you get my text? - No. What's going on? People of France... Sorry, man. I really am. Didn't you know? No. Want to get a coffee? Don't you want to share? No, it's OK. Tell us about the time you tried... to jump off. I just fell into the river. I've told you I was pushed, that's all. Rachid? - I told you I was once a dancer? - Sure! You don't believe me? For old folks! So, one night, I was in a club. On the dance floor, I see this chick looking at me. I go over. The thing is... I can dance, but I don't know how to talk. I take some ecstasy. It's like Astérix, I take my magic potion! Oh, right! OK! Stop! What're you doing? Use your hands. I might hurt myself. Oh, yeah, sorry. OK, well, use your body. I'm falling... We'll be here all night. OK, let's stop. Jacques, take over from Adrien, please. - Ready? - Yeah. - 1.. - Stand straight! 1, 2, 3. Is everyone here? How does it feel to leave today? What? You realized you were leaving today? No, uh... Yes, uh... Anything to say to the group? Yes, I'd like to tell you about... One day, just before I came here, I was... I was walking on a bridge. I was pretty depressed and... Halfway over... I slipped on a banana skin and I fell. Does anyone else want to speak? Amélie, anything to say? OK, Adrien? Yeah? Your mom's here. What's she doing here? It's the name you put on your file. The contact person for your departure. I was out of it when I wrote that. Should I call someone else? So I'm getting thrown out, am I? Great! I'm not throwing you out. Your therapy is over. It's good news. My therapy isn't over. I don't speak in the group sessions, so I'm thrown out. Great approach! It's true that... I can handle life pretty well. It's just that... sometimes I feel a bit... a bit down. It happens to me, just like everyone. Yes, like everyone... Like everyone. I don't want to go. I feel good here. You're done here. No, you're done here. - You have no problems. - Can't you... Can't you just give me some time to... You can't throw people out. I've been here for a while. Don't just fuckin' throw me out. We have sick people. You're not sick. You're not sick, you've no problems. Look at me. You see those in the group who have problems. Are you one of them? What's the problem? What's wrong? Why are you scared? You spend your time laughing. - I don't. - It's no good! Look at me! You resist therapy. It's pointless. I'm sorry. What's your problem? What's wrong? I'm sorry... You don't need help. - I do need help. - No! You've no problems, Adrien. - I'm sorry... - Look at me! Sorry. You were pushed off the bridge. Of course not. Do you still believe that crap about a banana skin? Of course I jumped! Should I tell your mom you'll stay on? Yes. Why did you jump? It was just into the water... Don't worry. And I'm doing better now. But Adrien, why... do you always minimize everything? It's like nothing's important. Because nothing is important. Did you really want to die? When I was your age, I was carrying you. Your dad and I came back from Brazil. And... I was on cloud nine. I couldn't wait to see you. I wanted us to get an apartment. To do everything together... To make a start in life. But he took off. He couldn't stay put. I was 3 months' pregnant. I was scared to take a plane. He took off on his own. So I went to my mother's. In those days, her sister, my aunt lived with her. They were like a couple. So they both started hassling me, telling me: "Do this, do that, you should eat this, and when the baby's born... you should dress him like this, talk to him like that..." I was on my own then, I was... a bit lost, I'd quit law school, I was like a mollusk clinging to your dad. Like my mom, I wanted to be a stay-at-home mom. And I had a breakdown. I was told so often what to do that I couldn't do a thing. And one morning... I got up. I was alone in the house. I made myself a coffee. And... I went out in the street, naked. The cops picked me up. And I found myself in a center... Like this one. Like you. Anyway, when I got out, I started studying psychology and I pulled myself together. Your father came home. You were born. And it was love at first sight when I saw you. You were my son. Why tell me all this? Well, to... tell you that you can... pick yourself up. Roger's not moving. He's having a nap. No, he's not moving at all. Still up? I can't get to sleep. Nor you? Want to play? Sure. What is it? It's called Idiot. I don't know how to play. I'll tell you. - You don't mind? - No. Thanks. It's dumb, you'll see. We each have 3 cards. Actually... Wait, I don't have 3. So you must put down a higher card than the last one. You can put down 2 of the same value. Number 2 brings all the values to 2. It's a joker. 3 brings... It copies the card below. With a 10, you pick up all the cards. A 7 needs a higher number. - OK. - Sorry, lower. - I'll pick it up. - Yeah, sure. Your turn. Knock on wood. - What? - I pick up all the cards. I've nothing higher or a joker, so I knock on wood. Knock on wood. I learn fast. You've already lost. You've got all the cards. No... It was just a joke. - Did I upset you? - No... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you. Maybe I was a bit abrupt. Sometimes... people think I'm making fun, but I didn't mean to upset you. I was just reacting, you know. - Sorry if I made you uneasy. - No, it's OK. Sorry. - I wasn't... - It's OK. ...being aggressive. You're forgiven. You have a pretty smile. - Sorry. - No, it's OK. - My hair... - Oh, yeah. It's cool. Hang on. Did you come? Yeah, sorry. It's OK... Ouch, my hair! - Don't hog the blanket. - Sorry. ...to join the army. Dear brother, maybe I don't want to. If your destiny is for France, mine is for love. But France is better than love. Have you no ambition? At least I have no frontiers. Very good, Adrien. It's shit. It's not shit. It's less than shit.
