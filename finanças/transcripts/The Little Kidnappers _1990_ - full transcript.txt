THAT'S WHAT MAMA TOLD US. - WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, GRANDMA? - WELL, IT'S LIKE A SAYING, YOU KNOW, BEEN PASSED ON DOWN BY THE OLD PEOPLE. I'D SAY IT MEANS THAT MacKENZIES HOLD THINGS UNTO THEMSELVES WITHOUT LETTING THEIR FEELINGS GET THE BETTER OF THEM. AYE.

A-AND THEN YESTERDAY-- YESTERDAY HE SAID IT WAS PAININ' BAD WHERE-- WHERE YOU DONE THE OPERATION. HE WAS GETTIN' ALL SWELLED UP AGAIN. OHH. SEE, I--I DONE THE BEST I COULD, DOCTOR. I MIXED UP A POULTICE TO HELP MY FRANK PUSH OUT THE POISON. - AND WHAT WAS IN IT? - OH, IT'S KIND OF AN OLD SECRET. I-IT'S BURDOCK ROOT TO SCRATCH THE DEMONS OUT AND HORSE DROPPINGS TO SEND THEM GALLOPING AND CHARCOAL MIXED IN WITH A WEE DROP OF SEAL OIL. - AND YOU PUT THAT MIXTURE RIGHT ON THE WOUND? KIRSTEN, GET SOME LIGHT, PLEASE. NOW I WANT--HERE. BRING THE LIGHT OVER HERE. I WANT TO HEAR THE PULSE COUNT. PUT YOUR HAND ON HIS WRIST. AND KEEP COUNTING, 1 TO 4, UNTIL I TELL YOU TO STOP.

THANK YOU. - I'LL--I'LL GET THAT BALING WIRE, DOCTOR. [DOOR CLOSES] - YOU WOULD MAKE A GOOD NURSE, KIRSTEN. - NO. YOURS IS THE GIFT, WILLEM. YOU SAVED HIS LIFE. - WELL, THAT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH DAMAGE HIS WIFE DOES WITH THOSE HOME REMEDIES OF HERS. - WELL, IT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE TO LET THEIR OLD WAYS GO. - I'M SORRY IT'S SO LATE. IT MUST BE AFTER 4:00. - OH, MY GOODNESS. I MUST GO HOME. - I'LL FIX THE CARRIAGE. - THIS IS FAR ENOUGH, WILLEM. I CANNOT LET MY FATHER SEE US. - WHOA. WHOA.

AYE, I THINK IT'S READY NOW. YOU GOT THAT SPOON, DAVE? GO AHEAD AND TOP HIM UP. - [CRIES] - HE DON'T SEEM TOO HUNGRY, HARRY. - [CRYING] - BUT BLOW ON IT FIRST TO COOL IT OFF. DON'T YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT BABIES? - [BLOWS] MAYBE HE DON'T LIKE EGGS. I DON'T FANCY THEM MYSELF. - HERE. LET ME TRY. YOU'D BETTER GET UP TO THE HOUSE, DAVE.

THEY WANTED HIM TO... STAY THE NIGHT. IF ONLY THEY'D TOLD ME, IF-- IF THEY'D NOT BEEN AFEARD. - THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THEY WERE AFEARD OF, JIM, THAT NONE OF US DARED SHOW YOU. THE BOX THAT YOU CARVED FOR OUR ALEC-- HARRY AND DAVY, THEY'VE BROUGHT IT HOME TO YOU. HERE'S HIS LETTERS. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO READ YOU ONE? - AYE. - "MY DEAREST WIFE, "I TRIED AGAIN LAST NIGHT TO WRITE TO FATHER. "BUT TO NO AVAIL. "I FIND IT SO PAINFUL TO PUT MY THOUGHTS TO PAPER, "AND YET I WANT HIM TO KNOW THAT ALL IS FORGIVEN, AND I FINALLY HAVE BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND HIM..." "AND THAT I LOVE HIM." - AH, WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HARRY? - OH, BUT THEY'RE JUST BABIES THEMSELVES. - IT'S THE CROWN PROSECUTOR. - [OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS] - IS HE IN TROUBLE, THEN? - WELL, MR. FRASER, GOOD TO SEE YOU. THIS IS MR. SINCLAIR, OUR CLERK FOR TODAY. - COME ALONG, DAVY. - DARLING LITTLE BOYS. - MR. SINCLAIR, AS CLERK OF THE COURT FOR THESE PROCEEDINGS, READ THE CHARGE. - "HARRY MacKENZIE, MINOR, "SOME TIME RESIDING WITH JAMES MacKENZIE, "THE CHARGE AGAINST YOU IS THAT YOU, "ON THE 21st DAY OF OCTOBER, 1903, "DID KIDNAP ONE KLAUS HOOFT, "INFANT SON OF HANS AND WILHELMINA HOOFT, "AND DID TAKE HIM TO A HIDING PLACE BY THE SHORE AND DID UNLAWFULLY KEEP HIM THERE." Tom: STAND UP, HARRY. HOW DO YOU PLEAD, GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY? - GUILTY. - DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY? - LORD HAVE MERCY ON ME. I'M 8 YEARS OLD AND A SINNER, BUT I MEANT NO HARM TO THE BABY. - HMM. AH, WE'VE GOT A BOY HERE ADMITTING TO KIDNAPPING. [CLEARS THROAT] DO YOU WANT TO ASK THE BOY SOME QUESTIONS, MR. FRASER? - DID YOU, HARRY MacKENZIE, ACT WITH MALICE AFORETHOUGHT IN KIDNAPPING THE CHILD? - HE MEANS DID YOU KNOW YOU WERE DOING HARM, AND DID YOU MEAN TO DO IT? - DID YOU MEAN TO HARM THE HOOFTS WHEN YOU WENT AND STOLE THEIR BABY? - NO, SIR. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT BELONGED TO THE HOOFTS. - YET YOU KNEW YOUR GRANDFATHER THINKS OF THE HOOFTS AS HIS ENEMIES. - YES, SIR. - AND SO YOU HATED THE HOOFTS, TOO. - JANI'S ALL RIGHT, I GUESS. - YET YOU WERE PICKING FIGHTS WITH JANI AT SCHOOL. IS THAT SO? - AYE, SIR. - YOU JUST SAID THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THE HOOFT BABY. SO, HARRY MacKENZIE, LET ME ASK YOU THIS. IF YOU DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THE HOOFT BABY YOU KIDNAPPED, WHOSE BABY DID YOU THINK IT WAS? THAT'S ALL, YOUR HONOR. - I NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS ANYBODY'S BABY. I JUST THOUGHT I FOUND IT. I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE DAVY AND ME, ALL BY OURSELF, WITH ITS MUM AND DAD ALL GONE AWAY. - AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TELLING THE CAPTAIN, THAT YOU FOUND IT, LIKE YOU SAID, DOWN ON THE SHORE. - AYE, SIR. - YEAH. WELL, LITTLE BOYS LIKE TO PLAY ON THE SHORE, DON'T THEY, EH? JANI LIKES TO PLAY THERE, TOO. YEAH, COME OUT HERE, JAN. NOW, WHAT'S THAT YOU GOT? - IT'S A BOAT. - BOAT, EH? MAKE IT YOURSELF? - I LIKE WHITTLIN' BOATS. - TELL ME, JANI, WHERE'S THE BEST PLACE, DO YOU THINK, IF A FELLOW WANTED TO TRY OUT A NEW BOAT HE JUST WHITTLED? - OFF THE POINT DOWN BY THE MacKENZIE PLACE, BUT MY FATHER DON'T ALLOW ME TO GO THERE BY MYSELF NO MORE. - THAT SO? AND WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WERE DOWN THERE, SAILING YOUR BOATS? WOULD IT HAVE BEEN THE DAY OF THE WEDDING, BY ANY CHANCE? - COULD HAVE BEEN. TELL ME ABOUT THAT BOAT. DOES SHE SAIL REAL GOOD? - TOOK OFF LIKE A BULLET. I CHASED IT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE POINT, BUT I COULDN'T GET IT BACK. - AND WHERE WAS THAT LITTLE BABY BROTHER OF YOURS? - I TOOK HIM WITH ME. WHEN I CHASED MY BOAT, I LEFT HIM ON THE SHORE. THEN WHEN I GOT BACK, HE WAS GONE, AND I WAS AFEARD HE GOT DROWNED. - [MURMURING] - SO YOU, HARRY MacKENZIE, YOU COME ALONG WHILE JANI'S UP CHASING AFTER HIS BOAT, AND YOU FOUND THE BABY JUST LIKE YOU SAID. - AYE, SIR. I NEVER SAW JANI HOOFT NOR NOBODY. - WELL, NOW, KIDNAPPING IS A VERY SERIOUS OFFENSE IN COLCHESTER COUNTY, A HANGING CRIME. STILL, WE DON'T AIM TO BE HANGING NO 8-YEAR-OLD BOY. AND MR. SINCLAIR HERE TELLS ME THEY WON'T TAKE HIM IN THE PRISON. BUT I HEARD THERE ARE PLACES FOR PEOPLE LIKE THIS, LITTLE BOYS, SO I THINK PERHAPS WE OUGHT TO CONSIDER WHETHER WE SHOULD SEND HARRY MacKENZIE TO ONE OF THEM REFORMING SCHOOLS. - [GASPING] - YOU SEND HIM AWAY, TOM, I'LL KILL YOU. - SIT DOWN, JIM. DON'T INTERFERE WITH THE COURTS OF JUSTICE. - CONTEMPT OF COURT. - SHUT UP, YOU SCRIBBLIN' PHARISEE. YOU KNOW ME WELL, TOM. YOU HAVE MY MEANING. - BE QUIET, JIM, BEFORE I HAVE YOU REMOVED FROM THE COURT. ANYONE ELSE GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AFORE I PASS JUDGMENT, YOU BETTER SPIT IT OUT NOW WHILE YOU GOT THE CHANCE. - I WANT TO SPEAK, TOM. I HAVE NO LOVE FOR JAMES MacKENZIE, BUT I WISH TO SEE JUSTICE DONE. ME AND MY WIFE BOTH WISH IT. HARRY IS A GOOD BOY. JANI AND HARRY ARE BOTH GOOD BOYS AND FRIENDS. I KNOW THAT IS SO. JAN SHOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT THE BABY. IT WASN'T HARRY'S FAULT. - NOW LET'S GET BACK TO THE MATTER AT HAND HERE. NOW, I TAKE IT NO ONE HERE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THESE SCHOOLS. - I COULD FIND OUT. - YES, I'M SURE YOU COULD. NOW, YOU NOTICE, JIM, I DIDN'T SAY I WAS GOING TO SEND THE BOY TO REFORMING SCHOOL. I JUST ASKED IF ANYONE HERE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM SO THIS COURT WOULD HAVE THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO CONSIDER SENDING HARRY MacKENZIE TO THE REFORMING SCHOOL IF IT THINKS FIT THE NEXT TIME HE APPEARS BEFORE US ON A SIMILAR CHARGE. CASE DISMISSED. STORE'S NOW OPEN, ANYONE AIMS TO BUY. - [MURMURING] - HANS HOOFT... HARRY HAS SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU. - I'M SORRY, MR. HOOFT, TRULY SORRY. - I BELIEVE YOU, BOY. - IF THERE WAS ANYONE TO BLAME, 'TWAS NOT HIM ONLY. - 'TWAS THE FAULT OF ME AND MY WIFE TO LEAVE JAN WITH THE BABY. - NO, THE FAULT WAS MINE. IT'S MY DUTY TO APOLOGIZE AND TO-- TO THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING OUT FOR MY BOY IN COURT. NOW, HARRY, YOU TAKE DAVY HOME NOW. STRAIGHT HOME, THE TWO OF YOU, AND YOU'RE TO SIT THERE IN YOUR CHAIR AND WAIT FOR ME. YOU HEAR ME, HARRY? - AYE. - OFF WITH YOU, THEN. - HERE HE IS, LADS. WHERE ARE YOUR BOOTS, JIM? - I SOLD 'EM. - YOU WALKED IN YOUR STOCKING FEET RIGHT THROUGH THE SETTLEMENT? - THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. MY FEET ARE CLEAN. LEASTWAYS, THEY WERE. MY GOOD NAME RESTS WITH GOD. MY PRIDE DOES NOT LIE IN ORNAMENTS. NOW, YOU TWO... I FOUND THIS IN MY BOOT. HARRY, SIT YOU DOWN. MAGGIE, FETCH A PEN AND PAPER. YOU WRITE THUS-- "TO..." - "HECTOR LARGE AND SONS, LIMITED." - AYE. - "WATER STREET NORTH, HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA." - "DEAR SIRS, "I HERE ENCLOSE $2.50 FOR ONE PUREBRED BORDER COLLIE." "WITH DELIVERY OF SAME IN GOOD CONDITION. YOURS IN GOOD FAITH, JAMES MacKENZIE." - THANK YOU, GRANDDADDY. - THANK YOU, GRANDDADDY. - DO YOU NO HEAR A CARRIAGE COMING, DEAR?
