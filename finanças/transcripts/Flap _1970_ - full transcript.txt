(male #1) Flap, stop. We dropped a box. [cars honking] Here comes Rafferty. He's been following us for about ten blocks. - Write 'em up. - Why? What'd we do? It's my job to keep an eye on trouble makers like you. There's a law that says them boxes gotta be tied down. Whose law Rafferty? Yours? You get back to the reservation before I run you in. Hurry up! Us Injun's only got one speed. You should know that. - You've been drinking again? - I just in the house, sir. I'm broke. Where'd you get this junk? Steal it? We picked it up at the depot and we're taking it to Silver Dollars. [vehicles honking] (Rafferty) Alright, let's keep it moving. Keep it moving. Flap, come on. That wasn't a very nice thing to do. Here, sign. If you can write. Here. I'm gonna see my lawyer. Yeah, you do that, big chief. Alright, let's keep on moving. Keep on moving. [instrumental music] [truck engine sputtering] [people chattering] Excuse me. Just set them down here, anywhere. Anything for me, Eleven Snowflake? What's this? What happened here? Oh-Oh, it fell off the truck, uh.. Oh, this one got slightly damaged there, you see-- I owe you five dollars for delivering this stuff. That's exactly what these retail for. Come on now, Silver Dollar-- Oh, the workmanship on these is so quaint. Did your people make them here? No. Made in Japan. You made your delivery, now get out of here? These retail for five dollars, you wanna give me three? (hooting) Flap, Flap, look at this! The Daily Independent pay me for that obituary. - Excuse me. - Wh-What's an obituary? It's a story about a dead guy. He died in Utah about a week ago. - What'd you write about? - A lot of stuff. - You wrote this? - Yeah. It's all there. - 12.50. - Yeah, look 'I made up stuff about him being a great chief and warrior.' You know, fought against the white man for, uh, stealing the whole damn country from us. Why don't you guys go outside. You're disturbing-- Exactly that way! I-I said, uh, "he actively resisted the advance of an expanding America." I said, you're disturbing my customers. Outside! C'mon! At least they pay me real money. - Outside. Outside. - But did you see the check? [Kenny Rogers singing "If Nobody Loves"] * We'll tend to say this to us * * The rivers to dust, a world without trust * * If nobody loves * * There is no way to be brave and nothing to save * * The earth is a grave * * If nobody loves * * The sun is only a flame * * If nobody loves * * Who but ourselves can we blame * * Nobody * * So write your name on the sky tomorrow we must try * * We might pass it by * * If everyone loves * * Children hold hands and decide * * Between peace and pride * * Is God on our side * * If nobody loves * * The sun is only a flame * * If nobody loves * * Who but ourselves can we blame * * Nobody * * So write your name on the sky, tomorrow we must try * * We might pass it by * * If everyone loves * (Flap) I'm gonna see my lawyer. - Wounded Bear! - Hey Flap, come on in. I found a fascinating treaty. Come in and listen to this. Well, wait a minute. - "The Chiefs and a head man--" - Hey, can we beat this? Let me-Let me see it. What-what is it? - Where did you get it? - Uh, damn Rafferty. Rafferty? That's hopeless. It says here in the treaty-- All these treaties, can't beat a traffic ticket. 'You can't expect to find a traffic ticket in a treaty?' Flap, take my check and pay the fine. - What is it? - He sold a story. That's not really a story, it's only an obituary. - Well, they paid you for it. - They paid you an advance? We're going over to the place to celebrate. - You want to come along? - Yeah, I'd like to come. [dogs barking] [engine starting] Come on, come on, get on, will you? Now, if you ever need any help or legal advise you come to me. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. [indistinct chatter] [dogs barking] Get off. What do you guys think this is, a rest home? [dogs barking] [horse neighing] Ah, shut up! Or I'll belt you. [hens clucking] Oh, boy! - You know what I think? - Hey, pull my leg, go on. I think you ought to sell him for dog food. Some day he's going to be a damn fine...riding horse. (Eleven) Hey, Storekeep, open up three bottles. (Flap) 'Make that the good booze.' [Flap whistling] Thank you. - Hi. - Hello, Flap. Hi, Bear. - Lobo. - Larry. [instrumental music] (Storekeeper) 'I outdone myself with this batch.' I tell you this stuff's fit for a chief. Here's to that old guy who died. Now wait a minute. Wait a minute. - Who's gonna pay for this? - I am. And I'll take my change in cash. (Bear) 'Oh, damn! I didn't know this is the obituary of old Iron Wolf. He was last great, uh, revolutionary. Why? You know him? Hey, Flap, you know when I first saw him I was a little kid this high. - Are you kidding? - Oh, no, no. He-He rode in right through here. Uh, there. And he had with him, oh, I'd say maybe four, five hungry, worn-out warriors. - Four or five, huh? - That's all. And the government, you know, was cutting the whole gosh darn reservation, right in half. And old Iron Wolf was ready to fight 'em. [both laughing] He'd take on the whole United States army. - Flap. - Yeah? When I first saw him there.. ...he was old, bloody and beat up. 'Oh my God, the way that man sat on that horse.' I wanna drink to that man. And to the next great Indian uprising. [explosion] [baby crying] [explosion] - Look, they're doing it again. - I know, I'm gonna call.. Can't you guys stop that racket for just one night? (male #2) Tell it to the boss! (Flap) I'm gonna tell you something else. - If we don't.. - What? Not again, please. [explosions continue] I guess, you're right. Nothings ever going to change. - We'll just sit on our butts. - 'I'm in.' - We're fine. - Hey, come on, sit down. - Uh, I-I'm out. - Take over from there. four, six.. Hey, now. What's wrong? Huh? So, you have to celebrate with those drunken bums, huh? Oh, come on, Ann, why don't you stop being so damn "holier than thou". You've changed, Eleven. (Flap slurring) '...pushed around, cheated.' He's changed you. Yeah. (Flap) 'Well, damn us to hell.' [explosion] Don't have to hide them bottles. Ain't no tribal cop. My kid can't sleep again tonight. - How is the baby, Luke? - Worse. Ann, ain't you got something a little stronger than those aspirin tablets? I don't know, but I'll look. Have we dad? - 'Don't think so.' - 'I better call a doctor.' He'll be walking all night. Luke, take the pick up. (Luke) 'Thanks, Flap. Thanks a lot.' [explosions continue] I'm...pissed off! - At what? - Everything. Like, in this day and age when guys are walking on the moon another guy has to go 15 miles to-to call a doctor who probably won't come anyway. What are you so griped about, Flap? [slurring] I'm generally griped about.. ...things in general. Like-like-like them old Romans feeding Christians to the lions and the Christians for burning all of them people. And the-And the US cavalry and the lousy Sand Creek Massacre. Flap, that was 80 years ago. The only good guy on our side was George Washington. (Flap) 'And boy-boy, what an arm.' 'The way he threw that dollar' 'like nobody ever threw it before.' 'And I don't want to hear none of you guys smearing him.' - 'You understand?' - None of us smeared him, Flap. [dog squealing] The thing I'm pissed off is most about.. ...is that lousy bull dozer.. ...not giving that little kid a chance to sleep. Things could be worse, we don't live so bad. You call four walls made out of Coca-Cola signs and spit.. ...houses? Yeah, but some got electricity and inside plumbing. You know what the trouble with you is? You won a couple of medals in the war. 'You were a sergeant, got used to ordering men around'. That doesn't give you the right to tell us what to do. Why did you have to come back here anyway? Because I'm stupid. And because this is my home. Flap, sit down, play some wampums. I'm not gonna sit around on my butt. Listen, you guys. Look, Lobo, we've been pushed around long enough. Look you can't take on the whole damn US army. No, they got too many guys. Can't fight a stand up war with.. [explosion] Uh, but there is something we can do. Like what? You know that article you wrote for the newspapers? I don't want to hear anymore about it. This boy has got brains, he-he can write. I'm talking about... public relations. I'm bleeding. I'm bleeding down here. Hey, just a minute-- That's the way we're gonna fight. 'Ain't nobody gonna help me?' - Just put him over there. - If you unmanned me.. - The word is "emasculate". - Let's check him out. Pull his pants out, will you? [groans] Let's see that guy. You mean, public relations means that Eleven's gonna write another article about another old guy that died? Lobo, it's not exactly like that, Lobo. It's-- - I'll kill you, Flap-- - Shut up. If worst come to worst, I'll do your love-making for you. Lobo, it's making people pay attention to us. It's making people take notice of us. - Give me some whisky. - Where am I hurt? Only problem is the thirst behind. Flap, we got the short end of the stick. No, we got the long end of the stick. The whole damn stick rammed right up. [groans] [explosion] (Flap) There goes that damn thing again! Help me! - Damn them to hell, Lobo. - You're right, Flap. [speaking in foreign language] Come on, you guys, you're only going to get into trouble. [weeping] - Flap, come quick. - What the hell is going on? It's scared off my dogs. [indistinct chattering] Give me. Give me. Oh, come on fellows, come on back. Leave these dogs. Hey, you wanna come stay at my house? No, no. She'll be back. You still think so, after all these years, huh? - You see? - Uh, yes. She go back along that road. Ah, she'll be back. [explosion] Damn that! Damn it! Wait a minute I think I broke it. Oh. Wait a minute. [moaning in pain] Wait a minute. Wasn't there some old fellow buried out here somewhere? Yeah, a long, long time ago. You know, he could've been out there some where or over there or it could be right around here some place. That makes this ground kinda special. - Don't it? - It's hallowed. This ground is sacrosanct. That's what it is. Is what? Lobo, those guys are tearing up our holy burial ground. - Oh, no. - Yeah. It's illegal, damn it. We'll sue them. Somehow we'll stop 'em! Hey, this'll make a great public relations story. - Yeah, he's right. - Oh, come on back, fellows. Come on, look, the booze is on me. - Come on, huh? - We got business. Oh, fellows, come on. You idiot, what are you standing there for? - Get out of the way. - I ain't going no place. Oh, what's going on, Bill? What the problem now? This guy's either drunk or crazy. And he won't move. Hey, look buddy, you're gonna have to move out of there. I ain't moving till you guys stop all this racket. Now, look, your counsel agreed to the right of away for this highway. We don't need no damn highway. Look, pal, we got a job to do. Just step out of the way. You are desecrating a holy burial ground. Well, if you don't get your butt outta there this will be an Indian burial ground. Gee, boss, look. The whole damn tribes-- I don't care what the hell they got out there. I got a time contract on this job. Now, move out. Please, gentlemen, please, no violence. This can all be settled in the court. The court? - Who the hell is this anyway? - That's my lawyer. These rock spread dangerous hazard to my men and I'm moving 'em outta there. Now, go on with your job. Now, you either get out of there or I'll get rid of you myself. Reconsider. One of you guys go help, Mr. Lyon. Don't hit them first. Just defend yourselves. [indistinct chattering] [clamoring] (Lyon) 'Bill, you let him in there, your fired.' What the devil are you doing now? Get me outta here. Get that truck maniac out of that thing. Put the bucket down. - Watch out. - What are you doing now? 'Hey, fellows, cut it out.' [indistinct chattering] Oh, Lobo, I'm sorry. [indistinct chattering] - What the hell do I push? - The lever on your right. - Push it forward. - Push. Right. - 'No. Your other right.' - That is my right. [comical music] There's too damn many levers on there. You got be an octopus to drive one of these damn things. - Damn key. - Where is the damn key? Now, you shut up. You come inside and stop it. [music continues] That's no way to run a revolution. Where is the steering wheel? There is no steering wheel. Use the paddle. - Oh, to hell with it! - Don't push that one. Here, sir. Let me help you. Get your hands off of me. Look out! [indistinct chattering] 'Look out! Look out!' [indistinct chatter] There's no damn brakes? Watch out, it's falling in. That's the shortest truck I've ever seen. Look, up there on the hill. [men hooting] I'm not gonna risk anymore damage. Get the boys and clerks we're getting out of here. (Lobo) The cliff! 'Get off of that machine.' 'You better jump. Get off of that damn thing.' 'You're gonna go all the way. Jump!' Hold it, Lobo. It's going over. [explosion] - Hey, you know what I think? - What? I think those damn things gotta have a steering wheel on them. (Eleven) Oh, I'm gonna write the hell out of this. [music continues] [indistinct chatter] [people laughing] [music continues] [people cheering and laughing] [joyous laughter and chattering continues] [music continues] [ball room music] [music continues] [music accompanied by singing] [music continues] [music continues] [fast-paced pleasant music] What? What happened? [groaning and grunting] W-what.. [horse neighing] (Flap) 'Beige Palm, I'm busy, don't horse around.' (Flap) 'What the hell are you staring at?' Come on, beat it. No privacy around here. Beige Palm, I'm in no mood to screw around. (Lobo) 'You ain't gonna to try to ride him today, are you?' 'Not after last night.' - You wouldn't believe me. - Yeah. What happened? Well, seems to me, we had a nasty bout with a bull dozer. Seems to me like somebody hit me in the head. - Quite a few people hit you. - Who all hit me? Oh, I don't think I hit you, Flap. - Uh-huh. - Yes, you didn't. First there was the bull dozer fellows and then it was Dorothy Bluebell. No! - Haven't you go it on yet? - Yeah, yeah. Oh, don't fool around. [mumbling] - Here, you can have this. - What? What's that? Tobacco, it's good for his worms. - Oh. - Yes. What the hell is Bluebell sour about? Oh, you were making love to Anette. Well, making love to Anette seems very reasonable. Yeah. Bluebell said she'll kill you if it happened again. Easy. Oh-oh-oh-oh. Easy, boy. Here we go. Easy. Hold 'em. Hold it. Hold it. [mumbling] Hey, he's alright. Alright, move away. Move away. O-o-h. Hey-hey-hey. Is the day.. [horse neighing] [up-beat music] [children laughing] Hey, Eleven, pull it. That's it. - Hey, Flap. - What? That's the most that horse has ever been rode. - Oh, yeah, yeah. - Easy. He's damn fine riding. [horse neighing] [dogs barking] Hello, Flap. [dogs barking] Hi, Larry. Oh, it's nice to see the Tribal Police Department. Together, all at once...this way. You ain't exactly surprised, are you? Uh...no, not exactly. Flap, just what the hell did you do last night? Uh.. Well.. Well, one thing and another. We.. Almost everybody is gathering for a meeting over at the hall. But, it somehow wouldn't seem...complete without you. (Larry) 'So, would you mind?' Oh, I don't know, Larry. I.. I'd like to come to a meeting. We'll follow you down. Okay. - What the hell is that, Larry? - That's your bull dozer, Flap. It's kinda interesting. Yeah, I wonder what happened to it? Yeah, I wonder. (Lyon) 'This is an itemized list of all my equipments destroyed' in addition to the lose in man hours. The total figures are run in the bottom. Now, I personally assure Mr. Lyon that if anybody here knew anything about what happened last night he will speak up. - Oh. - Hey wait. Come on, what's to do this? - I was only trying to stop you. - I'll tell you about it. I knew it! I knew it! That's him! Those are the ones right there. Well, that's why we're standing up. But, what I want to know is uh.. ... what the hell is he doing here? I'm representing the County Sheriffs' department. We got our own Tribal Police. We got Larry-- Whole thing started on the New County Highway. So, w-what-- The council has already voted to give Mr. Lyon the right of way to build his road. We're now talking about compensation for the damage. - Do you understand? - No, I don't understand. Who voted for this? I didn't. Did Eleven, did Lobo vote? We're trying to settle this peacefully and unofficially. Oh, yeah, unofficially, yeah. I doubt that you're gonna get much outta this, Mr. Lyon. Storekeep's the only one that's got any money or property. But me, I was, I was trying, I went outside and all of-- Why don't we get on with it. Assault and battery and destruction of private property. Look, He was trying to run over me with his bulldozer.. What are you talking about? You're the one that wrecked it. I was stopped it when your man deserted it. Deserted it? He was jerked outta it! I don't care how you twist the facts. 'A $33,000 bulldozer and a $3,000 truck' 'were completely destroyed.' I don't know how much they're worth. I admit they were a little damaged. A little damaged? Did you see that pile of junk? Doesn't look that bad. And besides, he was desecrating hallowed ground. He was also disturbing the peace. - Whose peace? - Mine, I got rights! Legally that doesn't matter anyhow. I mean, he's guilty by his own admission. I'm going to advise this council to let Sgt. Rafferty place, Flapping Eagle under arrest. Just a minute. This is an unofficial meeting and suddenly you got Flapping arrested. You stay out of this. [indistinct yelling] You're lucky they don't throw you in jail. Maybe that will teach you something. What are you working so hard for Rafferty? - You're part Indian yourself. - Would you shut your mouth! You keep your hands off of that. I gotta know what I'm being arrested for. Hold it! Stop! 'Seize and desist!' Just what'd you think you're doing here, Wounded Bear? Wounded Bear Smith and I am representing my client, Mr. Flapping Eagle. He took a six months correspondence course few years ago. Tacked a "Mister Smith" to the end of his name now he thinks he's a lawyer. Mr. Lyon's bulldozer was about to demolish the holy grave of one of our ancestors and that is illegal. You're telling me one of our ancestors is buried out there somewhere? Yeah. Larry, what'd you know about this? Larry? Probably way before my time. There's no mention of hallowed ground anywhere in that survey. Oh, Lyon. I have here a document that will prove our case. It's a treaty dated 1893 and signed by the commanding officer of the United States Army. (Wounded Bear) '"In the course of all living things' '"there must come the sorrow that we know as death.' "As it must come to the giant tree on the mountains.. ...and so, so, so it, uh.." Well, go on with it, on with it! I, I think that since Mr. Flapping Eagle has had the courage to defend the last scared resting place of his ancestors. I feel that he should read this document. - Here you go. - I don't wanna read it. This is my first case. [chuckles] Uh..."The giant tree on the mountain. So it must come to the...tiny flower of the field." Uh, May I? Thanks. "And so must it come to all men. Thanks. "Each of us, in the past has disturbed '"the holy last resting place of the other.' "In the.. "...in the future, we will each respect 'the final resting place of the other as if it were our own." Article three, excuses me, Pageas. "If any holy place must be disturbed "then it will be done in agreement "and good faith with the men of both...our nations. '"Our agreement will last longer than any heart shall beat.' '"It shall last so long as the mountains shall stand.' 'And so long as the rivers shall flow down to the sea."' Article four, "It is stip.. Stipulated. - "Stipulated and agreed by"-- - Pardon me. - Let me see that document. - What if that's a forgery? Forgery, pardon me. There's a copy of this in State archives. We're gonna check out that document. - You better, boy. - I'll do that. You're not outta this. You'll be in jail before this.. You talk to my lawyer, eh? Do I have the tribe's permission to move that grave? - Yes, yes of course. - Alright. I'll be out there and move that grave any place you want. Well, that's very nice. Eagle, you better watch your step. One way or another, pal, I'm gonna get even with you. You gotta watch that rotten temper. [discordant singing] * All we gotta do is find that grave * Fellas, fellas. Fellas, listen to me! Now, I got something I gotta tell you. Well, it's about that there treaty. I ain't happy about it, I had to.. I had to leave out the second page. - Why? - Yeah, w-what's it say? It says that, a man can do anything he wants to with the grave as long as it's long enough away. Well, how far is far enough? It's about as far as a man can throw a rock as big his hand. I'm pretty dam sure that grave is more than a mile from that there construction rolled out that way. - Alright, turn here. - Huh? - Gotta find that scared grave. - What for? We're gonna have to desecrate it. [country music] (Flap) 'Those guys are gonna be there in less than a hour.' 'Alright, Wounded Bear, where is it?' Come on, think, will you? (Wounded Bear) I think it's over that way or a little farther. (Flap) How much farther? (Wounded Bear) Uh, I ain't sure exactly. [music continues] Maybe we passed it. Why don't we try there by that bridge? (Flap) We ain't got much time. Which way now? (Wounded Bear) 'It ain't at all familiar.' 'I think we're getting close.' - 'Try over there!' - 'We just came from there.' (Flap) Lobo, stop this truck. Stop this truck. Everybody shut up. Turn off the motor. Now just give this poor man a chance to think. Now where is that damn grave? I told you, it was long time ago. Try to think, we're going to jail, you know? That's right. Look, when did you last see it? Eh, uh, Wounded Bear, where you going? I told you I'd find it. My store! This is going to save my store. - Kinda hate to touch it. - Yeah. Well, we better. And fast. [funky music] Hey, this looks better than the original. Yeah, pat it in. - Hey, they're coming. - Hey, hide the shovels. It ain't over. Let us play ball. Here, here, center to me. 43, 92 hike. Hike, hike. Pass. (Flap) 'Hello, Mr. Lyons.' Um, uh...here it is. It's nice to see your smiling face on my reservation. I never noticed these rocks here before. That makes me feel a whole lot better about you, Mr. Lyons. I mean, I couldn't imagine you knowingly disturbing a holy resting place. - I got a right to move it now. - Right. Billy, get a couple of boys up here with shovels. One of you men with shovels come up here. You see, Mr. Lyons, it's just that this particular chief uh, White Cloud meant a lot to all of us. (Flap) 'Well, we hate to see his remains tampered with it.' Well, it kinda.. ...kinda breaks my heart. This grave is gonna be moved. Sure, our hands are tied. It's a shame to move him after all these years. What is right is right. We gotta...obey the law. I'd still hate to fool with that grave. [dog whimpering] [dog barking] Get off dog! Go on. Get off! Get off of that. Come on, leave the nice little doggie alone, will you?. It ain't yours. I happen to like him. Who's buried here? Who died? The devil is he talking about? Who is this old man? What does he mean, who's buried here? - It's bad enough desecrating-- - I wanna talk to-- Please don't talk to this old gentleman like that. - I just asked who he is. - She'll-be-back-pretty-soon. - Who'll be back pretty soon? - That's his name. - Wait a minute. - No, no. He's waiting for the girl he married many years ago. She went into the city and she never came back. He sold his house and bought this car to look for her. The thing doesn't work. He sits here watching the road. He just says, "She'll be back pretty soon". And that's why his name, She'll-be-back-pretty-soon. - That's a stupid name. - Was your mother Morning Glory? - Flap, I warned-- - I came here to bury an Indian. - Can we get on with that? - Oh, please, Mr. Lyons. You said you would move the grave wherever we wanted. - Yes, that's right. - We found a real nice spot. Where? - Well, it-it's just a mile.. - A mile? - Why don't I kick this guy? - Wait a minute. I said I'd move the grave wherever they want and I will. Start digging, boys. Try not to disturb it too much, uh, boys. [singing in native dialect] [singing continues] - Is that it? - Yes, sir. I still don't see the difference between this place and the thousand others closer. This is the best place. - But why? - It has to do with, uh.. Spirits, uh, inner voices, the direction of the sun, uh.. They're crazy Mr. Lyons. Gee, I thought you'd understand, being Half-Indian. A white man will never understand the workings of the Indian's mind. - One last thing. - What's that? The old fellow got a real nice round trip out of it. [up-beat music] [horse neighing] [music continues] Come on, Dark Meat. Play fair. [horse neighing] [music continues] [crash] [laughing] Did you have to break our one damn chair? An Indian's horse is supposed to be his best damn friend. So you wanna get tough, huh? You gonna try him again? I think...he's had enough of one day. - Well, we're in the paper. - Oh, let me see it. Where's it? What is it? "Drunken Indians attack construction crew." - Hmm-umm. - But who wrote that? "Destroy bulldozer?" It says, you destroyed nearly $40,000 worth of equipment. (Eleven) "Rampaging Indians." (Eleven) 'Whoever wrote this' 'twisted around nearly everything I said.' It does say that the fight was started because of.. ...because the construction crew was desecrating sacred burial ground. Well, there's something in our favor. [horse neighing] What the hell are you doing? Flap, don't let him drink it all. Hey, come on. Give me that. [laughing] Just, just look at that beautiful animal. That's the homiest beast I have ever seen. What's special about him, is all guts and height. He's one, he's one hell of a man. You know, sometimes you can learn more from a dumb horse that you can from anybody. And learn what? Just learn to be like him. Not to let anybody push you around. You're not going on with this uprising are you, Flap? Yeah. I am. Have you all forgot? Geez, have you all forgot? Does it mean anything to you, the-the way we live? Are you satisfied that 400% more.. Mo-more than 400%, what was it about them kids? 400% more Indian kids die before their year old than any other kids in the country. Yeah. Are you happy.. ...that the average Indian makes 600 bucks a year? - Flap. - Yeah. What do you want to do now? Me.. ...or us? I'm with you. - Yeah. Lobo? - Oh, yeah. Wounded Bear? I'll go through every treaty I have. Maybe something will help. We'll make out a new press release and take it in tonight. I'll take care of it. Can't you see, you're ruining all the hard earned goodwill between us and white people? What goodwill? 'Some of us feel it's better to go on the way we've been.' Making a little gain here and there. Nobody is paying any attention to some of you. Oh, all you do is stand around here getting drunk all the time. Look, just look. 'Forcing alcohol down that poor beast!' It's inhuman. You poor boy. Come here. Come, come here. 'Come here.' Old Flap taking on H-Bomb. And you taking on that girl, Ann. I got a sneaking hunch, both you fellows are in the same kind of trouble. (Lobo) 'What do you mean?' Neither one of you ain't never gonna ride neither one of them. Listen, have you, uh, thought about the press release? Oh. yeah, right here. Listen. "Only a 100 years.." [indistinct chatter] We, of the Indian nation-- This is an announcement that you're startin' a revolution? And since we're gonna revolt, that ought to make news. Well, it certainly is frightening. What valuable piece of property are you gonna destroy next? Oh, we're not gonna destroy anything, sir. - What we're gonna do is build. - Build what? Mister, why don't you just, uh, read what he wrote? - Yeah. - Look, like he says here. "Uh, we must, uh, introduce.." "To the sacredness and and anonymity some fresh air of the new Indians." That's right. "A fresh era of new honesty and integrity. A fresh era of the new greater Indian, freedom and equality." As you can see we wanna build a feeling in people for.. - ...well, for other people. - Yeah. Gentlemen, that is certainly not news worthy. If we raise enough hell ,maybe it will be. If you do that, I'll be glad to interview you.. ...in jail. Well, you don't give a damn, do you? Give a damn about what? [instrumental music] Ah, I had put my guts into this story. Now, maybe it makes a revolution, uh.. ...more interesting, if, uh, if nobody's on your side. I am. When you have a story that will do you some good.. ...bring it to me. The name is Gus Kirk. [instrumental music] Car twelve. Give me Sgt. Rafferty. [music continues] Yeah? Ah...we're looking for job. Got a union card? Uh.. You got to belong to a union to-to do that? That's right. Now, why don't you guys just head on back to the reservation, huh? Hey, wait a minute. Is that, is that you're truck over there? Yeah. Maybe I do have a job for you. Come here. [mellow music] Hey, uh, how's it going with you guys? - Huh? - I mean, uh, your revolution. - Oh, pretty good. - Oh, yes? - We just started ours. - Oh. - More or less. - Yeah. How many people you guys got? - Oh, about 25 million. - And how may you got? - Five. - Five million? No, no. Just, uh, five. This car is gotta be cleaned out. I'll give you buck an hour to clean it and haul it away. And, uh, let me know when you're through. Okay. No, no, no. Wait. Oh, somewhere just around in the corner of my mind, I.. - I've got it. - You got what? The idea.. ...for the next big move in our revolution. Oh, can you give me a hand? Well, it's coming to me like, like a word on the tip of your tongue. Well, whatever it is, it's.. ...it's sure a beaut'. If you just stop thinking about it.. ...maybe it'll pop out. Yeah, I'll try that. [train chugging] Hello, Eagle. Flap. [groans] What did you do that for? - Is it bad? - I don't know. We'll see. - It better not be. - Come on, let me see. Starting a fight and assaulting an officer. You three are under arrest. If you'll arrest them, you'll arrest me too. - Mr. Lyons-- - I started this fight. You know I did, because you set it up for me. Mr. Lyons, I was just trying to be helpful. You were losing. I was. But I wanna lose my own fights. Now, if you arrest anyone, you arrest me too. Do you want that kind of trouble? I thought you and I were friends. Whoever gave you that idea. - How's his head? - He's gonna need a doctor. No, I need a drink. You son of a.. What're you hanging around for, Rafferty? You're gonna book us or what? Oh, where's my hat? Here. Here. Easy. His skull might be cracked. You act like they tore your head off. He's gonna need more than a drink. You're right. I need two. - You're going to a hospital. - Ah, come on.. You're gonna see a doctor anyway. I know a place where the drinks are free. - Free drinks? - That's right. Free drinks. [laughing] (Flap) 'Wrong Ball.' (Flap) 'Oh, yeah.' Good one. Wait, wait. - What? - It-it's my shot. What am I shooting at now? 'Six ball, side pocket.' Ain't got a clear shot, huh? How's your head feel? It's good stuff. By the way, I've been meaning to ask. - What? - What was the real reason? What was what? The real reason for that free for all you.. ...you started the other night. You might say I was opening guns for a.. Kind of a revolution which we are.. ...we're cooking up. A revolution? Yeah. [chuckling] 'You're turn, Mike. Quarter on this shot?' Well, what the hell is so funny, pal? Nothing. - So? - Nothing. You know I ain't exactly fond of you three guys. Yeah? I do think that your people have been stepped on long enough. 'Quarter you owe me.' Eleven, it's your shot. Oh, yeah.. Well, here you are. Well, this.. You a captain or a major? Oh, captain in the, in reserve. - Ackdoom. - Flap was a sergeant. He's the second most decorated Indian in the whole world. Is that true? Oh, yeah, yeah, I was decorated. With seven pieces of shrapnel. Well, wha-what gonna happen to that then? Oh, insurance coming to take care of that. Great. Hey, Flap, look at that. - That's a reservation. - Uh-huh. You know what that is? Yeah, that's, uh, a map of the road I'm building. Yeah, I see. And this is the, this is the highway, right here. Yeah, and right here is where we buried him. No, no, right here is where we dug him up. We buried him way down there off the map someplace. Yeah, we buried him down there, but we buried him here first after we dug him up down there, right? That's right. I knew I never saw that grave before. By God, I knew it! oh, we-we better shove off. Ackdoom. It's still early. You, uh.. Do you wanna bum around this for a while? Well, yeah. You got any ideas? Oh, we.. ...pay social call on the.. ...on the trade wench. - Oh.. - Umm.. What's the matter? Why not? What's a trade wench? Well, it's a, uh, it's a kind of prostitution house where a lady friend of mine works. I haven't been to a whore-house in long time. It's not a good whore-house, it's very.. Oh, you wouldn't like it. You oughtn't to be anywhere near that. Bluebell is gonna kill you. Well, I-I can handle Bluebell just like that. How about it? Well, this is Muscles. Hello. - Hey, hey, you guys go first. - Come on. What, a grow man afraid of one little girl? - I'm not afraid of her. - Come on. [laughing] (female #1) 'Oh, hi, Flap.' - Hi, pretty lady. - Hi. - Well, how's things been going? - Well, nice and quiet. I don't want those men to see me here. Would you like to, uh, go to my place? - Yes. - I'll be there in little while. You can go out that door. There. Alright. 'Now, what are you gonna have, fellas?' (Flap) 'Well, Mike, uh..' Oh, make it scotch all the way around. Including the young ladies. [whistling] (Flap) Who is, who is this stunning blonde? Sedie, tell the big jerk to drop dead. Now, now, deary. This is Paularada and Paulie. - And Dorothy Bluebell, sir. - Well, tha-that's Mike. Look, why don't we all kinda, kinda sit down, Bluebell. It's better not to have to stand in this same room with some people, much less, sit in the same table. Do you understand? Bluebell.. Shut up. Will you shut up? Come on, now, Bluebell. You know how I feel about you. Yeah? Yeah, then why, why didn't you come back and explain to me what you did. - Because you swore to kill him. - Oh, will you cool it? Honey, uh, I was gonna come right back and I-I apologize but, honey, I didn't think you'd believe me. Well, I might, I might have believed you. Why, why? Why? Uh...well, Eleven, will you tell her? Uh.. I think she'd believe you, Flap. Well-well, sure she would. Go ahead, Flap. Well, somebody tell me. Tell me. Honey, I-I was so ashamed of myself. I mean.. You know, when I come to my senses and.. ...and-and they told me about, Anette and me being in that.. ...in the back room, together. Yeah. We thought he was gonna break down and cry. - Didn't I? - Oh, it was terrible. Yeah. Then why did you do it to her? Uh, honey, I.. I-I know this is going to be difficult to understand. Honey, do you know that I was so drunk.. ...that I thought it was you? What do you mean you were so drunk? Nobody get's that drunk. You know me so many years. Oh, she-she's a skinny brunette. Honey, it was damnest thing that ever happened to me. I-I went kind of blank. That's right. Later on, when he found out about it he was crying like a baby. - Didn't I? Yeah. - Yeah, like a baby. Oh, come on, now. You really felt bad? Oh, I thought I'd never be able to look in the, the eye again. You know, it took all three of us just to drag him down here tonight. Oh, yeah, I thought we'd never get him.. It wasn't that hard, fellas. Oh, maybe. But you can understand how a girl's feelings could get hurt? Honey, what-what I did was-was terrible. Okay? Hey, do you wanna come with me to Rodeo Sunday? Are you riding? Well, I gotta pick up a few bucks for the traffic ticket. Yeah, I'd like to go to the Rodeo with you. That's my little girl. Oh, I forgot. Listen, I gotta go out for a-a little while. - Now? - A half hour or so. - You wait here for me. - Oh. - You promise? - Yeah, I promise. (Bluebell) So long, fellas. See you later. - 'Bye, Bluebell.' - 'Take it easy.' (Flap) 'Uh, hurry back.' [instrumental music] No, no, stop, stop. Not again. Not again. Lobo, if I don't say hello, the-the lady's feeling will-will be hurt. That ain't the kind of feelings you got in the mind. I'm just gonna be nice, polite, and pay my respects., ...to that gorgeous, gorgeous brunette. Alright, alright, but.. But don't you pay nothing but your respects. Lobo, you worry too much. [music continues] [engine cranking] [people chattering] Oh, that stupid car wouldn't start. Everybody here got a little drinky? - Yeah. - Umm.. Where's Flap? - Flap? - 'Hmm.' Uh, he-he, well, don't worry about him. We-we'll help you get the car started. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, listen, we can use the-the truck. - Come on, we'll get you-- - No, forget it. Where-where did Flap go? He-he just feels real sick. He's in the men's john. Oh, yeah, yeah. I better go help him. No, no, he feels really rotten. Yeah, he'll feel awful bad if you saw him. - It would be embarrassing. - Yeah, come on. [screaming] Oh, never mind, keep going. [screaming] (Bluebell) 'I am done with her when I get a chance!' Next time I'm gonna slice your blonde head and.. - Embarrassing. - Flap! Did you think she was me this time too? Bluebell, will-will you try to understand? No. No, no, no. I'm gonna fix you. I'm gonna fix you so that you'll never do this again. Listen, there-there are people here. - You lousy two-timer. - You do it all the time. But I'm a professional. [music continues] Hold on! I will put on my pants. What the hell's the matter with that dame? But we can't sell any ammunition or gun from the reservation. [indistinct chatter] Hey, Flap. Flap, here's one. Says, we own all the fishing rights in the Ariba River. (Flap) Oh, that river's been dry for 30 years. Came to pick up the empties, Flap. Well, you better pay me. What do you mean? I brought you fresh bottle. - The good stuff? - Yeah. Okay, leave it inside. Alright, right over the bay. Right here. Anything left unattended on the reservation becomes a property of the tribe. Hey, we-we got a gun? Well, it's just a triggy dated 1884. It says that, "Any property left unattended or otherwise "on an Indian the reservation "and said left unattended property belongs to the Indian or Indians who find it." 'That's all.' Hey, I've got it. Whoa! - I've got it. - You got what? The idea. [laughing] Oh, boy. Well, I should say, it got be a little, uh, a little risky. Life and limb risky or jailbreak risky? Maybe both. And it's gonna take a lot of guts. As long as it's not completely suicidal, I'm with you. That's my boy. Where're you going? [laughing] What's your idea, Flap? Here's the spread that cuts off onto the reservation. And that switch controls it. That switch? Hasn't been used in more than 20 years. You mean if.. If we can switch that train off on a reservation then.. Then we own it according to the treaty? [laughing] And this time you better be sure about that treaty. I am. Here get her up. Hit that. That's good. - Come on, give me a hand. - Push. Come on. 'Push.' It works. What about the people on the train? (Wounded Bear) 'That will be kidnapping.' - Flap. - Yeah. Listen. - If it's a freight train. - Yeah. There's only people in the engine and the caboose. Yeah. We can swipe rest of the train out from.. ...from between 'em. We're stealing seven eights of a train. And I can write the hell out of that. - I guarantee television. - You can, huh? Right. And Lobo. You gotta be our switch-man. But you gotta switch at the right time. - Oh, I can do it, alright. - Yeah, yeah, sure. Look, Lobo. Try to think hard, uh. Switch up, engine keeps going straight. Switch down, trains goes on to the reservation. Switch up, caboose goes straight. - You got it? Uh? - Yeah. Now, you-you say it back to me. Uh.. Switch up and that, uh, the train keeps going straight. It goes that way. Yeah. The train keeps going straight. - That's right. - Uh.. Switch down and the train goes on to the reservation. That's right. - The switch up.. - The caboose, the caboose? And up, caboose goes straight. Yeah. Yeah, But you can't take long to decide. And Lobo, you can't be wrong. Look, engine goes by, switch down. The caboose, switch up-- Flap, Flap. Now, don't throw too damn much on me all at one once. Alright, alright. Look, we'll practice, uh. I'll be the engine. Okay. I'm coming down the tracks. [imitating train] - What do you do? - Throw switch up. - No! - Yes! - He's right. - What do you mean? He's right. Yeah, yeah that's, that's right. Yeah, switch up. Alright now. Now, the train is coming by. [imitating train sound] - What do you do? - Uh, switch down. Train goes on, uh, on a reservation. That's my boy. Alright, you guys. We're going up the line to find a place to jump on. No, you-you stay here and-and practice. - Come on. Hey, Eleven. - Don't you worry, Flap. - Ain't nothing to it. - Come on. Hey, we're counting on you, uh. Engine goes by, switch down. The caboose goes by, switch up. Engine goes by, switch down.. [instrumental music] [train whistle bellowing] [train chugging] Hey, look out! - Come on, get closer. - I can't. Jump in! Jump! [instrumental music] Look out! [music continues] Flap, watch out. 'Flap.' Who in the hell put that damn thing there? It's dangerous. Go on back! [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] Switch up, engine goes straight down the track. Switch down, train goes off in a spur. Switch up, caboose goes straight down the track. Oh. [train whistle] - Watch for Eleven. - I told you I could do it. It worked. It worked. It was easy! [instrumental music] [music continues] [screaming in joy] Hey, Eleven. I've done it alright. - I've done it alright. - Great going, Lobo! [screaming continues] I told you. Lobo! Lobo, the caboose! Lobo! Lobo, the caboose! Switch up, Lobo! Yeah, but you guys were great. It really wasn't tough at all. I just...threw the.. The switch, oh, God. Yeah, yeah.. Whoa! [laughing] Hurray! [indistinct singing] [music continues] [dogs barking] [helicopter whirring] [whirring continues] I want to go on record to say that in my whole career this is the first time I ever, ever lost a train. Well, thank you very much, sir. [indistinct chattering] [horse neighing] One train we picked to steal, it knocked you out of a job, huh? How'd you like that, huh. (male reporter) 'And, what is your name?' - This is quite a story. - Yeah. Getting coverage all over the country. I wonder how it happened. Did you do it? Come here. Come on. Glad you got here. Mr. Gray, this is, Silver Dollar the man I was telling you about. Do you or any of your tribe members have any idea how this train came to be here. I can't tell you how but I can.. I can probably tell you, tell you why. Oh? Looks to me like some Indians got mad about the way they've been uh.. About the way they've been pushed around and.. ...did this to.. ...make people notice 'em. So you see, it's impossible for these boxcars to be separated accidently. How do you explain it then? Otherwise, why should they steal a train? Pretty good, huh? Making off with a whole train. Well, like, somebody did. You feel then that somehow this train was stolen? - Well I-- - No. Not necessarily you know. I hear some of these railroad fellas uh, they drink. You know. An awful lot. - Thank you very much, sir. - Goodbye, goodbye. [horse neighing] There he is. That's Flapping Eagle. The one in the middle. [neighing continues] Mr. Eagle. I'm Steve Gray. Investigator for the district attorneys office. Oh, how are ya? Mr. Dollar, here, feels you may know something about this. Why should I know about this? What're you telling everybody? - That I know somethin-- - Alright, back off. - Don't touch, don't touch. - Excuse me, sir. Flap couldn't have been involved. - He was with the three of us. - 'Mr. Gray.' Hold it, hold it. He's the biggest headache we have reservation. I'll handle my own investigation. It was him alright. Alright, Rafferty, that's enough. Do you uh, have any idea how this train got here? Uh.. Teenagers. You stay here. Our immediate problem is getting this train back to the city. Oh-o, you, you can't do that. This train ain't uh, movin'. Who says so? May uh.. May I present uh.. ...my lawyer, Wounded Bear. - Smith. - Oh, of course. Wounded Bear Smith. According to this treaty, anything left unattended on this reservation belongs to our tribe. What the devil we gonna do with it? The way us Indians live, we can use it as a long, thin apartment house. - Hey, that's pretty funny. - Hey, hey, hey. This is gonna be your school room. Hey, Flap, this one's air conditioned. We can make it into a super market. Super market? What're ya trying to do? Put me out of business? Over here! Eleven! Look at this one over here. This makes a great pool room and recreation hall. Flap, stop this nonsense you've started. [horse neighing] Mr. Gray, you can take the livestock.. ...but we're moving in tomorrow. We don't want the train. All we wanna have is no trouble. You better make up your mind, what the hell you are. You're gonna wind up like, Rafferty.. ...half Indian. I ain't. [dog growling] Doggie, doggie, you shouldn't have done that. Hey, Raff, let me give you hand. Oh, Raff, okay. Come on, don't get so mean. He didn't mean it. Oh, gee, I'm sorry. [horse neighing] Hey, Raffy, come on don't be a sour head. Here, that's it. [gun shot] [horses neighing] [crowd clamoring] [neighing continues] Hey, old man. [dog barking] [dog growling] Come on, get those ducks moving, will you? Hi, Flap. Oh, Running Springs.. ...take my place, got a southern exposure. The third one down. Hey, will you move those ducks? How you doing, Flap? Hey. How are you, Captain? Kinda funny how that train got into the reservation. Yeah, kind of funny, ain't it? What do I do next? Got any suggestions? No. I'd turn it over to my sergeant. Carry on. Will do. [gun shots] [dog whining] - Hey, what's the noise? - Go back. What happened? My dog's down there. Go-go-go back. Go back. Go back. (old man) 'Come back to me.' 'Don't be frightened. Come to me.' Rafferty? [old man grunting] [panting] [speaking in foreign language] [crow cawing] [playing shakers] I wish him forever. Air and water. Good friend. Fine man. [playing shakers] I'll remember. Good thoughts moving. With light upon your face. Returning spirit. Good man. [instrumental music] Raffy, I admit to swiping that train. I knew you were behind it. Who helped you out? There's no use getting anybody else involved. It-it-it's just me. Alright, keep talking. Look, Rafferty, I'm gonna let you take me in. Why? 'Well, things just got out of hand' an-an-and I know...look, look, ju-just do it, alright? Don't bring half the force to kick the hell out of me. I can't make it for a couple of hours. - You stick around. - Yeah. [insects chirping] Alright, get in the car. Ah, you're gonna have to take me. [crickets chirping] [car honking] [glass shattering] [utensils crashing] [glass shattering] [grunting] [cow bell ringing] [cow bell ringing] [glass shattering] [instrumental music] They got him to a hospital. But I hear he's pretty bad. Just lie still. [helicopter whirring] It's the county police. Where do you think you're going? I gotta get to my place and pack and head to the highway. You get out there and stall him. Wait, wait. Go on. [whirring continues] Sorry about your roof. Oh, that always happens in a high wind. It's alright. We're looking for a man called, Flapping Eagle. - Eh, Flapping who? - Eagle. We heard he hangs out here. - Oh that Eagle, eh? - We haven't seen him. - We'll just take a look around. - Would you care for a... - They're coming in. - Let me take a look. - Capt. can you make it? - Yeah, sure. Sure, come on. [instrumental music] [music continues] Grab the saddle, you can sell it. [music continues] [music continues] Looking good. You'll never make it to the highway. (Larry Standing Elk) 'The county police are all over the reservation.' You're a cop beater. I think you'd be doing yourself a favor if you turned yourself over to me. Oh, Larry.. ...you, eh, you know I'm not gonna do that. I was afraid you'd feel that way. (Larry Standing Elk) 'Alright, we'll wait here.' Suppose I went up there? I doubt if you could make it up there. - Flap...Flap. - Yeah. I don't think that truck can make it either. [horse neighing] H-Bomb...H-Bomb, come here. You can't ride him when you're-- [indistinct chatter] Alright, come on. Alright, alright. [horse neighing] What you gonna do, Larry? Well, I gotta go act like I'm looking for you. Thirsty, huh? Huh? Yes. Now, he's gonna cooperate. I ain't too sure about this, Flap. You two ain't never got together sober. H-Bomb.. ...you and I've had a lot of fun and all but.. ...I'm in big trouble now, see.. ...I gotta go up into those mountains. You're gonna take me, huh? Okay, buddy? Huh? Come on, have some more. Have some more. That's it, boy. H-Bomb, do me a favor? Don't screw around. Gi-give me a hand, will you? H-Bomb, come on. [horse neighing] [instrumental music] Open the gate. [music continues] Look, that's him. This is car 12, we spotted him. Look like he's headed up to the Bakers. [helicopter whirring] [music continues] [whirring continues] Him. Come on, now. Get lost. [whirring continues] [music continues] [gunshot] [music continues] No, no, no, the old Indians used it in the.. ...must've meant something. All you had there was a lotta smoke. How are you supposed to signal somebody to come? I dunno, but I do know you ain't doing too good. - Think you can do better? - I think anybody could. Watch this. Ah! What are you guys smoking? Flap! You mean, you really got our signals? Must have been a secret message. I see, he was burning the blanket afterwards. Hey. Stop. [laughing] How'd you ever train him so good? Yeah, he don't mind being a rouge. Just unlike all that horsemen. Hey, old boy. Hey, we got a bottle. You wanna drink? I could use one. How's Rafferty? He's a...alive. There's a lot of people down here who'd like to see you tarred and feathered. Yeah. Well...thanks. I got the answer. You're gonna be alright? - Yeah, I'm gonna be alright. - He's right. Listen to him. 'This's signed by the Vice President' United States, 1953.' Tells us of "Any man so much of the white man's law "uses fire arms, with intent to kill "or results in the death of any Indian "on this reservation-- Got that? "Then all the land as far as a man can walk "between sunrise and mid-day "shall revert back to this tribe" Rafferty, violated this treaty when he shot the dog. And She'll-Be-Back-Pretty-Soon, did because of that. - That's right. - That's right. And they shot at you, with intent. Well, if this thing is legal. We can claim a hell of a lot of land. A lot?...Hell, we.. ...we can claim.. ...the city. What? - We can? - Yeah. That's right. And legally, we can. - Hey, can we, Flap? - You're damn right, we can. No, no, no, wait a minute, Flap. You can't go in the city, yet. Well, somebody's got to go. Flap, they're gonna put you in jail. Then, you do it. [instrumental music] [music continues] (Eleven Snowflake) 'So by marching on the city, at least we'll prove to people 'that we're trying to do something.' 'Now, this is our one real chance.' The only way it'll work, is for us to stick together. All of us. What are we standing around, listening to him for? He's nothing but a kid. We have to make people realize that we believe in what we're doing. And that our claim to the land is real. (male #3) 'He's just gonna make trouble.' Wait a minute. Listen, this is something that we have to do. Ah, you don't know what you're talking about. (Flapping Eagle) 'You're right, Eleven is crazy.' You know, I-I look at you and I wonder what happened to men like our fathers and our forefathers. (Flapping Eagle) 'Silly men who died for silly words' 'like, like freedom and justice.' 'But I guess times have changed and so have we.' And living here, the lousy way we do is exactly what we deserve. Anyway, nobody is asking you to fight. (Flapping Eagle) 'We're just gonna deliver a piece of paper' that will do our fighting for us. Because let's face it, that's what we've become.. ...Paper Warriors. Well, maybe I'm crazy like, Eleven, but I'm going along to deliver that paper. - Flap, going in there is crazy. - I just made a big speech. Flap, they're still looking for you. - They'll recognize you. - No, they won't. Flap, they'll throw you in jail. Well, you guys are so tough to get along with. [people chattering] [drums beating] [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] * We've been homeless too long * * Looked over too long * * It's time now it's time * * Oh brother it's time * * Give us our land * * Give us our land * * Give us our land * * Give us our land * * It's time now it's time * * Oh brother it's time * * Oh we've been homeless too long * * Looked over too long * * It's time now it's time * * Oh brother it's time * * Give us our land * * Give us our land * * Give us our land * * Give us our land * * It's time now it's time * * Oh brother it's time * * It's time now it's time * * Oh brother it's time * * Give us our land * (male #4) 'Give us our land.' It's alright officer, these gentlemen here are spokesmen for this group. Gentlemen, my name is Harris. I'm special advisor to the mayor on Indian affairs. Ah, His Honor, has already seen a photostatic copy of the treaty and has studied it quite carefully. And I can assure you, he'll do everything about it as soon as possible. [cars honking] 'Give us our land!' [honking continues] 'Give us our land!' 'Give us our land!' I can assure you people that everything's been taken care of. So, if you'll just clear the streets, move along now you've created quite enough congestion, well, just-- Just stay where you are, nobody move. To hell with the traffic. We're here to see that treaty honored. I know, I can speak for the mayor when I say that I do respect your treaty. And I do respect deeply any annulled commitments 'and agreements made by the government.' Then in the name of our Indian Nation we claim this city. - Right. - How dare you? Who do you think you are? Me, uh, I'm just an Indian. An Indian who claims this city. - I-I-I-- - Or an Indian who claims that the United States is a liar. I-I-I assure you, your treaty will be honored. That's real fine of you, sir. An-and I want you to know that nobody has to move out, yet. You can still use your homes and your place of business just like normal. We're gonna be a lot nicer to you, than you were to us.. ...when you took our lands and our homes away. Your treaty will be honored if after verification of the facts and thorough expert study of the document-- 'E-ex-excuse me, sir, and who are the experts?' The Federal Government, of course. Oh, no-no Indian experts? A-a-are you questioning the honor of the United States government? Now, what Indian can never question the honor of the United States government? You all simply go peacefully back to the reservation. 'A-a-and get out of the streets--' If you don't mind, sir, we'll camp on our land and wait for the answer. - Everybody, sit down. - Yeah, yeah. Come on, sit down where ever you are. But-But getting a final answer might take years. Sit down everybody. What the hell, we've waited this long. (altogether) Give us our land. - 'Give us our land.' - 'Give us our land.' - 'Give us our land.' - 'Give us our land.' I gotta get through. Let me speak to him. As chief of your tribal council, I demand you get on your feet on go home. He's the one who started all the trouble. That's him, Flapping Eagle, the cop beater.
