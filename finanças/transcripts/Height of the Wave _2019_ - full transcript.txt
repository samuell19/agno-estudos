Please be careful so that nothing unpleasant happens. I'd like to repeat that. We're hunting wild boar from 9am to 2pm today. Please stay out of the mountains and keep your cattle or goats in one place to avoid incidents. This is the village foreman talking. Sangyi. Sangyi. Sangyi, come eat. Mom, where've you been? Aren't you going to school? It's vacation. You should eat. You should eat. I don't like it here. I wanna go home. I've never heard... A wild boar ate a calf? They eat sweet potatoes and potatoes. Oh my, that's scary. Officer, you know how hard it is to kill a boar? They don't die even if you hit the head with a hammer. You slit its throat and it just squeals all day. You have to shoot it or drown it at sea. They're tough just like demons. Yes, hello? Yes. Yes. Yes, I know. Yes. Can you come to Yeosu on the weekend? I think I can go this Sunday. Did you receive the papers? No, I didn't. 980 dollars per month isn't bad. It's a good deal so you should settle. Yes. Many come because of their joints. They're elderly so they have bad backs or knees. And we use a boat or chopper for critical patients. Say 'ah'. There are lots of flu patients now so many of them come for that. Doctor. Do you have Diazepam or Lexapro? Do you have depression? I have a panic disorder. If I order them now, it'll take a couple days. I see. Chief. I should have introduced myself. I apologize. I'm the village foreman. I see. I've been caught up because of wild board recently. Let's talk on the way out. I'll be waiting then. Okay. I have a lot on my hands. Wild boar are the least of my problems. I've been everywhere, trying to get approval as 'a desirable destination island'. If we don't get it this year, we waste time but the residents aren't interested. You'll have to help us out. You smell wonderful You must use good shampoo. The residents prepared a welcome party for you later. It's not easy to get together. Don't be late. You're not going? Go on ahead. Okay, see you later. Hello. I heard the office closed but it didn't? Everyone left a few years ago so there's no priest here now. But the church doors are always open. Since everyone's here. Artificial flowers. Yes. So they don't change. Why do you look so lonely, Chief? I thought I was the only lonely one. I have to deliver mail. Bye. Hello, I'm Inspector Yeonsu Nam transferred to the Maritime Police Station here. I'd like to thank the village foreman and the residents for this welcome. Chief. I'll... Yes? Hello, I'm Inspector Yeonsu Nam transferred to the Maritime Police Station here. I'd like to thank the village foreman and the residents for today. I'll be working with you for the next 2 years. Chief, come here. Make some space. Take care of her. And fill her glass. These people work the hardest in the village. Please help us out. Yes. I asked you to fix the rocks in front of the seawall years ago. Cars can't get into the dock. I can't do everything I want just because I'm the foreman. It takes time to submit a request to the provincial office. You're always demanding. You always say the same thing. Just wait. What's important for our town now? What if we don't get approved? You think only of yourself? Bring some booze. All right. Yae-eun. Yae-eun. What? Come here. I have to take this. Why not? Just one drink. - Kiss me. - No kissing. - Have a drink. Just one more. - I have to take this. Just have a drink and go. Just one drink. 1, 2, 3. What are you doing? - I told you she's ticklish. - Don't. She really is. I said don't. - I said don't. - Let's go now. I have to go to work. - I said don't. - Let's go now. - I don't want to. - Tickle? You didn't pay last time. Where're you going? - I don't wanna do it here. - It's okay. Don't put your hand in. - Okay, Okay. - Me first. Rock, paper, scissors. Pay me first. - You didn't last time, 100 dollars. - I will, I will. 100 dollars. The crazy fucker. Why are you here, you pervert? Hello. You have to pay me today. - Am I pretty? - 100 dollars. - Bro. - It's narrow. You guys love me, too? What's love? I love you. There's ants in here. Why are you killing them? You don't know. The ants will come to our town soon. They get in the house and eat the pillars. There's only a few, because it's cold now but once they're in a house, they'll become hundreds, then thousands. Let go. Why are you killing them? Don't come here. Why are you killing them when they're far away? Go in. Go in. Why aren't you going in? Go on. It's your fault this happened. We wanted to be friends. Let's go. On a day as good as this. On a day as good as this. Wouldn't it be wonderful if my love would come? When did you first meet Yae-eun? It was from when I got out of the army so I was 23 in 2015. Detective. Can't you stop writing? Did I do something wrong? It could be a violation of the Prostitution Act. Up to 1 year in jail and a fine of up to maximum 3 million. I know what that is but that's not what we did. We just... like each other and it happened naturally. I know what you want me to say but it's not like that between us. I have a record for assault. A 1 year sentence and 2 years probation. Can't you stop writing? Please? Detective. Chief. Talk with me. Talk with me outside. Talk with me. Since when did Yae-eun live here? Her folks got washed away by a big wave in a storm 15 years ago and died. She had no relatives and was too young to go to an orphanage, so I took her in. That was 15 years ago. Are there others her age on the island? What are you trying to do here? There are only 3 young people. They were all in this house. Yae-eun can't go out to sea. The four were in one house. What happened yesterday happened. And those guys come every year. Why are you asking that again? I heard you're having a hard time making ends meet. Seongdae, Jeongmo, and Jongyeong are sincere for 3 years and 4 years have been working hard. They're not bad kids. If you're trying to turn this into something weird or perverse, Where's Yae-eun's room? Flies like flowers, too. It's a fly flower. Yae-eun. Talk with me for a bit. Don't run away. Come talk to me. Come out and talk to me. You're scaring me. What happened in the woods yesterday? Sit and talk. Sit down! I saw what happened in the bamboo forest last night and I'm asking you. Oh. Chief, you'd look really pretty with longer hair. I have to grow my hair fast. But I'm pretty sometimes even with this short hair. But people don't know. Everyone's pretty at least once. You received money. You'd be real pretty if you grew your hair a bit. You received 100 dollars yesterday. Do you know how little that is? I have to get tints, lotion, mascara. And I have to pay rent to Uncle Sanghun with what's left. You gave money to Uncle Sanghun? I give it to him because I want to. He really hates taking money. I should to give him more. Have Jongyeong and Seongdae been paying you for the past 3 years? There was big lightening on the mountain 3 years ago. The trees split open. But people said a tree struck by lightening was good luck and took all the pieces. From 3 years ago, right? Yes. When I was 17. Yae-eun, listen carefully. I'll help you to go to a women's shelter in Yeosu. You need to be treated. I'm not sick anywhere. Not one little bit. Sis. Sis. Sis. Sis, here. Sis. Please open this door. You're the chief's daughter? I was gonna give it to her earlier but couldn't. You take it to her. Sis. Manicure. Tint. Take it. Why are you giving it to me? Sis, take me with you. Where do you live? You brought the residents' agreement? Yes. Raise your hand if you agree. I believe you all agree so I'll move on to the second item. The Maritime Police are on their way here to take Yae-eun. Chief Nam's been making calls to take her to a women's shelter for treatment and to get her checked out. Then the Maritime Police call me right away. What good would it do if unsavory stories about our town got out? Nothing good would come of it. You will send Yae-eun to Yeosu? By boat? How come you didn't tell me? I just heard of it, too. What? They're coming to conduct due diligence here. We should send Yae-eun to land like Yeosu or Mokpo for 10 days. And bring her back after it's done. Do you agree to that? Yes, we agree. That's good for our town The whole town raised her. You raised a child with no parents. You're all like parents. If we agree, then Yae-eun agrees. What are you talking about? Yae-eun is our kid. What did Yae-eun do wrong? What did she do wrong? Let's talk. Are you doing this because I didn't sign the agreement? Why do you think of only yourself? There's an order to things. What are the 3 conditions of 'a desirable destination island'? The leader's leadership, residents' participation, and a clean environment. What have YOU done for the town environment? No. This is the residents agreement. No, I'm not sending Yae-eun. 800,000 dollars in 1 year, 4 million dollars in 5 years. If we get selected for this project, the whole town could change. If you're not going to help, don't come to the meetings. You all have time in the afternoon? Yes. Please come help me. If we get picked, it's 800 million a year and 4 billion in 5 years. We can do everything we want then. What are you waiting for? Come on. Let's find Yae-eun. Yae-eun, what are you doing? Hello. Yae-eun, you should go to the mainland for a bit. There's a big event in town. You being here would be inconvenient for everyone. Eat some good food and do what you want for 10 days in Yeosu. I'll come get you in ten days. - I can't go on a boat - Yes, you can I can't go on a boat. You can bear it, right? Could you take her outside? Where's Uncle Sanghun? Why're you asking for him? I really can't ride a boat. Yae-eun, it's okay. - I really can't go on a boat. - Don't worry. - I can't go on a boat. - Stand up. - I can't go on a boat, you know. - It'll be fine. - I can't go on a boat. - It'll be fine. I can't go on a boat! I really can't go on a boat. - Aghhh! No. - What are you all doing? Yae-eun. Stop them. What is it? What are you doing? Yae-eun. Let go. Let go. What's wrong with you? Stop it. - Put your shoes on quickly. - Stop it. We have to send her. Yae-eun, put your shoes on. Let go. Yae-eun can't go on a boat! Let go. Stop them. Get her, quick. Don't come here. Run! Run! Grandpa, no. Move Yae-eun, run away! Why are you doing this? Just run fast. Yae-eun, run away! Just run fast. Don't come any closer. Sorry. Come out. What are you doing? Were you studying? What are you doing? Spit it out! Spit it out! 'A' shall pay child support for Sangyi Goh within one week of filing for divorce of 150,000 dollars or 97,000 dollars at once and 980 dollars monthly until Sangyi Goh is an adult 'B' will, until the date of filing for divorce, Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! with regard to 'A's possessions at the residence of 'B'. with regard to 'A's possessions at the residence of 'B'. Give it to me! You brought me here for 980 dollars? You sold me out? Or did Dad dump me on you? That's why you locked me up here? To stop me from seeing Dad or going to Seoul? You didn't make any of this. You bought it all from the market. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Where's my toaster? Where's the toaster Dad got me? What are you gonna do about the toaster? Is anyone here? Who's there? Who is it? What are you doing here, Sangyi? Why are YOU here, Sis? Why are you here? I lied so I got kicked out. Sis. Can you take me to Seoul? No. I can't go on a boat. I'm afraid of the ocean. Why are you afraid of the ocean? The waves. The waves will swallow everyone up. So I'm scared. I think I know what you mean. My mom's like you. So she takes medicine. - Come here. - Yes. Mommy can't go on anymore. Yae-eun, you can't be here right now. The villagers will come looking for you. Go over the sand bank to the mountain with no wild boar. Stick it out for 10 days. Granpa will come get you. I'm sorry I couldn't protect you. The villagers are blinded by money. You're getting punished because I'm a coward. You're not a coward. I have to be back before dawn. People shouldn't see me. I'm sorry things turned out like this. Sis. Do we have to leave here? Yae-eun. Yae-eun. It's Grandpa, Yae-eun. Yae-eun, where are you? It's Grandpa. Yae-eun. Yae-eun. Come on out. It's Grandpa, Yae-eun. - Check it. - Yes. Did you catch some wild boar? We didn't catch any. What's going on? What the hell? - What? - What? The provincial office called to say the case has been filed. What's that? I secured a statement and am checking it now. But there's a new issue. When she first started this, she was 17. Then, there's additional penalty for prostitution of a minor. A fine between 20,000 to 50,000 dollars and a jail sentence of 1 to 10 years. Solicitation is up to 7 years in jail and a fine of up to 70,000 dollars. So what? You got proof? You only have Yae-eun's testimony. You got proof beside that? Boars are not the issue! What are you doing here? Where's Yae-eun? Check the room. - Go through the kitchen. - Come on out. Go inside and search everywhere. What are you doing? You saw Yae-eun throw a fit and take off. Prostitution of a minor is 7 years jail time. The fine's up to 70,000 dollars. What'll you do? Did you plan this with the Chief? Chief Nam got Yae-eun's statement. It mentions everything you did. You did that since she was 17 and gave her money. Prostitution of a minor is up to 10 years in prison. And you get 7 years. Is it because of 'the desirable island' thing? I'll sign it. Stop this. That's enough. You only think of yourself. They're coming out to check next week. We don't need the agreement. If Chief Nam has Yae-eun sign her testimony, you're fucked. The business, too. Wake up. Wonjae, I can't find her anywhere. You should go look for her then. All right. You're so pathetic. Why are you just standing there? Go find Yae-eun. You wanna go to jail? Don't go out. Stay here. I said don't go out! Sanghun, what is it? What's happened? What is it? - Dad. - Yeah. Did you see Yae-eun? No. Sangyi, answer the phone. You can go back. Sis, why do you have to run? I wanna run. Don't say that. Running away is a cowardly thing. You should go home. Your mom's looking for you. I wanna stay with you. You're alone. Yae-eun! Yae-eun. Where are you going? - Yae-eun! - Hey! Yae-eun! Sangyi, We have to go. Where? Run? Yae-eun, where are you? Yae-eun, where are you? Yae-eun! I'll get you. Yae-eun. Yae-eun! Yae-eun! Yae-eun is over there. Where you going? Yae-eun! - Yae-eun! - Yae-eun! Yae-eun! Yae-eun, come here! Yae-eun! Be careful. It's all taken care of. Come out. Yae-eun, come on out now. What are you doing there? I can't stand the sight of you. Get lost. Sure. What? Didn't you hear me? I said get lost! What? You brat. You dare look at me like that? Fuck off. Yae-eun's in trouble 'cause of you guys. - Whatever. - How's that our fault? Then whose fault is it? - Let go. - You think I can't beat you up? - How's that our fault? - Let him go. What the hell are you doing? We're not here to catch wild boar. What are you doing, huh? What are you doing? Did you do all this? Come here. Come here! Fuck. Fuck you. You crazy fuck. Tell me. You know where she went, don't ya? Move. Don't you tell me? Tell me! Stop it already. Stop it. Hey, stop it. Yae-eun did nothing wrong. She's not a wild boar. Hey, hey. - Stop it. - Move! Stop it! Fuck. I said stop! You think it's a joke? Yae-eun isn't a wild boar. Yae-eun isn't a wild boar. She's not a wild boar. What is it, Sis? Nothing. My whole family's here. There's my grandpa. My dad, my mom. How'd they die? I don't really remember. I was on a boat. I didn't see it. Mom and dad got washed away. Right in front of me. Maybe I just made it all up. I was too young then. And I don't remember what I saw. Then I'll become like you. My mom and dad are getting divorced. So I can only see him once a year. If I can't remember Daddy and I forget his face and the good memories with him, will my dad be dead like yours? I don't want to forget your face. - Watch your hand. - Yes. Come on. Go up. It smells good. Try the other way around. Sis, why are they trying to catch you? It's because I lied. If I could ride a boat then I wouldn't have to run away like this. Why'd your parents split up? I don't know. No one told me. Sis, give me the manicure. There. Sis, give me your hand. Go like this. Do this. What's this? This is... a magic stamp Look. You press like this. Look. Then we'll never break up. Pretty, isn't it? - Sangyi. - Yeah? We got nothing left to burn now. You have to go home. Your mom's looking for you. What about you? I want to stay with you. I'm not saying you should go because you're sick. Give me your hand. See, we stamped this. Yeah. Now, I'll watch over you no matter where you are or what you're doing. So for now, go to your mom's. Then what about you? Are you coming to our house, too? Yeah, let's go. Because your mom's a good person. I know. My mom's a cop so she'll protect you. Right? Hello. Hello. Hey. I calculated it after checking the property tax and income tax. Considering Sangyi's father's income, 980 dollars monthly is reasonable. It's a good deal so let's settle. I shouldn't talk to my husband directly, should I? What? Why? I think my daughter called him. I don't think that's a good idea. Please sign here. On a day as good as this. On a day as good as this. Wouldn't it be wonderful if my love would come? I'm the only one you can trust on this island. You guys should just trust me. I'll go to the district office and the police station. You heard about the lady in the next village? All right. She ate a wild boar and its mother smelled it and charged. I see. So the boar got revenge? Yeah, so they captured 4 so far. That's a war. Wild boars are messing up our town. It's a big problem. On a day as good as this. On a day as good as this. I sit in a field of flowers and look at petals. Where did that lovely light come from? Beautiful flower. Yae-eun, why are you crying? Yae-eun. Oh, Chief Nam. What are you doing here? Are you sick? You hurt? What's wrong? Are you sick? Did Yae-eun go somewhere? Something happened and she ran away. Did I mess things up? What's wrong? When I worked at the Mokpo Maritime Police, my job was to pull out dead bodies. When someone drowns, the food in their stomach rots and the body fills with gas, which makes them float. Once the gas is out, it sinks infinitely. To the bottom of the ocean. Then... we can never find them. Thinking about that keeps me up. Why am I telling you this? I never even told my family. It's a good thing I met you. I was lost. Are you lost, too? This path isn't for people. So there's lots of wild boar. And lots of traps set for them. So it's dangerous. Let's go down. Get up now. Get up now. Let's go down. Huh? There's so many lights on in town. Take this. Hold onto this. Like this, just like this. Hold it. Hold it and shake it like this. Shake it like this on the way down. A boar has poor eyesight, so if you shake like this, it will think you're a big animal. Let's go. Keep shaking like this. I'm so happy I saw you today. You have a gun since you're a cop, right? You all know what this is, right? It's from Yae-eun's room. Everyone here knows. Yae-eun's door opens if you pay. I know who paid and knocked on her door. Take this money back. And don't ever try to send Yae-eun off the island or lay a finger on her. And don't ever come near my house. Or else, I'll chop off your heads like a mackerel's. So... You want everyone to go down? You knew, didn't you? Know what? It's all about you and your fishing village life Hello? I'll talk to you later. What? Speak properly You're sure? Okay. You and I need to talk it out. Come on out. What is it? I keep getting calls that Yae-eun and Sangyi are going to Chief Nam's house. Who's that? Chief Nam's daughter. We don't have time. You're not trying to screw everyone, right? We have to find Yae-eun before Chief Nam does and send her to the mainland. You're gonna screw everyone? You guys go to jail and Yae-eun stays alone? That's not what you want. Why should we all die together when there's better way? We don't have time. We have to find Yae-eun before Chief Nam finds her. Hey. Once we find Yae-eun, I'm leaving. Where are you going? Hey! Why are you taking a gun? There's no bullets in here. They won't lie if I have a gun. If Yae-eun's not here, then what? I have something to tell Chief Nam. Shit. Chief, I saw Yae-eun and your daughter heading home. But Jongyeong and Seongdae took a gun and ran off to your house. It's dangerous. We have to hurry. Granpa, let's go. Do you think I can live here? I think your mom's gonna send me off to Yeosu. Sis, eat first and worry tomorrow. This tastes so good. It's Mom. Where's your mom? Yae-eun's here, isn't she? No, she isn't. Her shoes are here. Sangyi, come here. How'd do you get here? Be straight with me. Did you ever love me? Calm down and let's talk over there. Calm down? Did you sleep with the villagers? Go inside. Let's talk over there. - You played with us? - Don't. Listen. Did I pay for you? Is that right? I never said that. Jongyeong. - Put the gun down. - Don't move. - Don't move, sit down. - Be careful. Sit down. Fuck, I said sit! OK, I'll sit. You sit, too. Put the gun down. Yeah, calm down. Lower the gun. Sanghun, you said you'd treat me like family. Then why'd you make me sleep in the water tank and you slept in the engine room? Or at least pay me properly. Did I come for money? I came because of Yae-eun. Tell me the truth. You knew she was selling herself, didn't you? Guys. let's calm down. Now is not the time for this. If I go to the provincial office and explain, we can take care of everything. If you do what you feel like and they take Yae-eun away, then what will you do? Guys, think rationally. Now we don't have time. If Chief Nam takes Yae-eun away, then there's no turning back. Let's be rational. - Put the gun down. - Mom. Sangyi. Grandpa. Yae-eun slept with the villagers. I really loved her and I go back to prison but what about the villagers? Isn't that wrong? Jongyeong, the villagers are all relatives, friends or alumni. They're all connected. How could I tell you? I couldn't. Yae-eun can't take a boat. How would she get out? I'm sorry it couldn't help it. - Put the gun down. - No excuses. Stop, I knew she was getting money from you and it's my fault for not stopping her then. When she got money, she loved buying things for me or Sanghun. That was the first time I saw her so happy so I couldn't stop her. I'm sorry. Look at me. Look at me now. I said look at me. We met when I was 17. I really liked it back then. I didn't have any friends here. I really liked you guys. Then we slept together. And you guys gave me money so I could dress up. I used the first money I got to buy clothes and cosmetics. And I bought presents for Uncle and Grandpa. But the more money I got, the more things I wanted to buy. From last year, when I knew you were coming, how much I could get and what I could buy I was calculating. That's when it all started. I started lying to myself. I lied to myself that I was still in love. I'm sorry. So? What? - You wanna die? - Don't you step aside? Hey, be careful. Be careful of the gun. Get lost. You said you loved her. Then how can you point a gun at her? You just don't want to go to prison. - Fuck off. - Don't. Why are you lying? Put it down. Put down the gun. Put the gun down! Put it down! Be careful! Sangyi! - Sangyi! - Get the gun. Sangyi, are you okay? Sangyi! Sangyi! She hit her head. Sangyi Sangyi, are you OK? What's this? No bullets? Idiots. What do we do now? Sangyi. Sangyi. Mom. How long did I sleep? Mom. I found a way to stop their fight. I wanted to tell you earlier. I'm going to teach Yae-eun how to swim. Then she can take a boat and go to Seoul. Then people won't fight like this, right? What's your baptismal name? Gabriella. Didn't you go in water for your baptism? That's different from the ocean. Yes, it's the same. You promised. Let's go in. Don't go. Then I'll go in first. You'll protect me. Sangyi. Don't go. I can't go in. Sangyi! Sangyi. Don't go! The magic stamp. You said you'd protect me! No, don't go. Don't go! Sangyi! Don't go! See? You can do it. Yes. Yes. It's been determined prostitution of a minor wasn't. Yes. Yes. But I think we need to reinvestigate the case from the beginning. Yes. The suspects are all the residents.
