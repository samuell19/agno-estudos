Play at the middle! Coach! When are these boys going to play? Soon, soon! Come on, play in the middle! Play here! Come on, sweetheart. Come on boys, let's play! Your parents aren't paying for you to come and just watch. Come on, Martin! Get up! Keep playing! SPIDER CAPITAL OUT OF FOOTBALL My purse! Help! Please help! Grab him! Give it to me. Open the trunk. Sir. Sir, please. Sir! Sir! Take it easy. -What is your name, sir? -Some respect. -What's your name? -Take it easy. Gerardo Ramírez. You're being detained. Get on the stretcher, please. You're going to have your injuries cheked. Go on, sweetheart. Got it? Yes. -Hi, grandma. -Hi. -How are you? -Good. Hi, mom. Thanks a lot. -I've got to go, I'm in a real hurry. -Don't you want to come in? -I can't. -Bye. Inés, have you seen this? Enjoy! ANOTHER CITIZEN TAKES JUSTICE INTO THEIR OWN HANDS -Are they here? -Yes, they're all here. Here are the meeting minutes. -How are you, darling? -Hello. Forgive me. I've got a lot of explaining. It's fine, I was the only one on time. I got here on time too. I don't believe you. Okay. Excuse us. We got mixed up with Ximenita and we didn't inform you, that today's board meeting is cancelled. So, I'll leave this here for you to take a look. You can let me know later. -Nice tie. -Did something happen? No, nothing. It's just that Ricardo asked me to take care of something important so I don't have time for our issues. -Did something happen? -Dear, do you remember Judge Campos? Yes, the intern's father. I need his home phone number. -I have his cell. -No, not his cell. His home number. Don't worry. -Comissioner. -Inspector. -Does he live with someone? -No, alone. Can we change the music, please? Turn it off. Hi, my name is Inés Hurtado. I'm the College Queen candidate for the History and Geography department. -To the camera, please. -Okay. Out of all the international figures this year, 1971, who do you most admire? Fidel Castro. -Really? -No, sorry. Pope John XXIII, even though he's dead. Snow or the beach, which do you prefer? Skiing in the snow. In a bikini. Changing the subject, describe your ideal man. That's easy. My ideal man is waiting for me over there. Look at him. Handsome isn't he? Imagine, he washes dishes while I read Ezra Pound. How do you spell Ezra Pound? E-Z-R-A-P-O-U-N-D. If you could change something of your body, what would it be? Everything. I would've liked to be born a man. With a bad-boy face. Like his. Real bad. I'm sorry, young man. I'm crazy. How can you tell someone will be a good husband? -Gerardo! -Please, concentrate. Do your job! It's easy, that's called a flash. It has to be pointed at the background where there's a young lady in a blue swimsuit that says "History and Geography..." Are you kidding me? Seriously, it's very easy. Gerardo, it's not the time or the place. Gerardo please! Sergio, are you okay? For God's sake... What's wrong with you? Gerardo, get out of here! Sergio let me help you. Do you want water? Do you need something? Let me go. Hey buddy, did you lose your job? But you left with your head up high. Congratulations. Boxing or karate? I was in the Air Force. -Why did you leave? -They threw me out. They say I've got a bad temper. Horrible temper. Do you still want to defend the Fatherland? What? You don't have to be in the Air Force anymore to defend the nation. -Are you talking politics? -Not at all. We're against traditional politicians. Do you need a ride? Come on, get in. Get in. Tomorrow morning I'll contact the district attorney and let you know. Thank you. I am very grateful. Sorry to have called you at home. No problem. Sleep well. Good night. -Get out of here! -Justo! I'm here! I'm tired of this, ma'am. Everyday it's the same. Oh, honey. Justo, enough. Gerardo's alive. Look at you. We need to call someone. -Lie down. -We need to... -We need to call someone. -I already have. Rest. Here. I'm fine. Let's have a drink. Can I? Olga, what medication did you give him this afternoon? He took two pills. And two whiskies ma'am. Why did you let him? No wonder you're like this. To the firing squad, dirty communist! Hands up! We are these bubbles. Putting pressure on the cork. And Allende is the cork. That drunk we have as president. Justo, are you going to clean this up? I forgot that the boss is here! Bad joke. And these are the spider's legs. Putting pressure and more pressure. Gerardo, have a drink. We're not in the Air Force. We are allowed to sin. Just a little bit. A toast to Chile's future! Cheers! The district attorney told me that this man supposedly died in 1973. Now that we know he is alive, we can investigate more. And it turns out he's been living in Argentina all these years. He worked as a guard in a timber yard and then at a gas station in Bariloche. There he shot a robber in self-defense. There were no charges. Then when he appears somewhere, there's always a fight. He goes off the map in Argentina. He came back two years ago to pick up a small inheritance and a house his mother left him. That's where he lived and where they found the guns. Well, as soon as I got your phone call I decided to send him for a psychiatric evaluation. It gives us some time. But we judges can't determine a person's mental state. That's what the doctors are for. They deliver a report to the Court so that we can determine the accused's future. But something can be done, can't it? Something can always be done. If you like, I can recommend he stay in the psychiatric ward. That's what you need, right? I don't need anything in particular. But after a life as a professor at the Catholic University, directing companies and foundations, where I've inaugurated schools for poor children, I think I've earned the right to live in peace and without fear. You couldn't resist throwing your whole resume in my face. Who do I need to talk to? To me. No one else. And please don't contact the psychiatrists. -They're not to be trusted. -I understand. And you'll tell me what this man did to you. CHE LIVES IN THE HEART OF CHILE Comrade! -A cigarette, comrade? -Ok. It's looking good. Excuse me. It's spelled wrong. It's with an "s", not a "c". Hey, you idiot! What's wrong with you!? "Shile"! "shansho", "la shaleca"! You don't know how to speak, fuckin' communists! Fascist scum! You fucking communist! Let go, you piece of shit! Come on, come on! I'm looking for Dr. Ferrara. -Ma'am? -I need to talk to Dr. Ferrara. You can't come in. You are not a doctor. I am not a doctor. I am here to visit a patient. Do you have to be a doctor to visit someone? -You can't come in without a pass. -So much bureaucracy in this place. Clear the way please, ma'am. Careful! -What are you laughing at? -Nothing. I am eating like Gerardo. Dog, dog. -Dog! -Sit! Fuckin' sit! Fuckin' sit! Pick it up! Pick it up! Dog, bad dog. Pick it up! Back to bed, sir! Don't look at me like that. Ladies like me don't get divorced. Looks like this gentleman is quite famous. -Why? -Look. Three calls from the district attorney and two from the judge. Will you interview him, Jorge? I'm sorry I've had a really bad day. You go ahead. Me? Should I go? Yes, sure. Excuse me. Hello. Mr. Gerardo. I'm Nadia Rojas and I'll be part of the medical team that will be talking with you. How are you? I'm going to ask you a few questions and taking notes to see how we can help you, is that OK? Excuse me. Doesn't matter. What did you say your name was? Nadia Rojas. I thought it was gonna be harder to get him talking. I'm going to start with something very simple. Why you are here? I would like to know that. I ask you what I'm doing here in this hospital for crazy people. It's a precaution by the judge to protect the accused's rights. Can you tell me about the incident where the young man... Guillermo Fernandez lost his life? I was just fulfilling my civil duty. -What is your duty? -To help a women who was being robbed. -Do you like helping people? -Yes. I always have. And you like to be respected too, don't you? Otherwise you'd be working in a private clinic, making a lot more money. What do you think about the person dying? -Are you married? -That doesn't matter. Let's suppose that you are married. You go into your house, or apartment and you see your husband in bed with another woman. It's your right to take a gun and shoot him in the head. No one would be surprised. When a person decides to steal, to take what's not theirs, they are betraying an entire society and they are exposing themselves to death. And all those weapons in your house were for... The people's sacred right to defend a free state. Many men have done it before me. It's a shame they were betrayed. Who betrayed them? Do you still believe that this is a free society? -Doctor Ferrera? -Yes, that's me. -And what do you think? -It annoys me to see this mess Ma'am, you can' t be here! Come with me. while the corrupt politicians subject the people to accept the... unacceptable while they plunder the country. What do you mean by unacceptable? Do you know that in less than 30 years Spain, France and Germany will be predominantly Muslim. Can you imagine what will happen in Chile? -That worries you? -Of course. It should worry you too. -Time is up. -Okay. We're going to leave it there, ok? Thank you. Does this man give you orders? Behind that glass are other doctors helping you. Do you know what happens in this country when a woman acts like a woman? Nobody listens to her. I need you to understand that this man has mental disorders. It's your responsability to prevent him being a threat to society. We can't rush a diagnosis. I appreciate anything that can be done. Chile is the first country in the world to democratically elect a socialist president. But while the supporters celebrate, the anti-marxist groups react quickly. For us, Germans, their parade reminds us of our obscure past. These are the links of a chain that make the shape of a spider, that is crawling all over Chile. And if you look closely, the chain is broken on both sides. Because thanks to our militancy, Chile will decapitate this hellish two-headed beast that is attacking us with its two heads. One is international capitalism, which humiliates the honest man that works for his fatherland. The other head is Marxism, which robs him of his soul and his freedom. -Free of Marxism and capitalism? -Exactly. Look, our patient was in Fatherland and Liberty. Yes. You, smoking? Who are this young people? These are the children of the Chilean oligarchy. But also youngsters that come from the slums who get a dollar per political action. Money comes from the right-wing economic power and the CIA. A lot of people see us on the streets with our helmets, defending ourselves from the communists and they think we're violent, but it's not like that at all. We have to stop the onslaught on the fatherland. The fatherland is like a woman. If you see a woman being raped What do you do? Call the police? No. You stop it right there. That's what a man does. What can you tell us about Marxism? It's awful. -Sorry? -There's no place for Marxism in Chile. Nor anywhere in Latin America, in any country. Nor anywhere in the world. So what do we do with half of the world's population with no place? Tell me, I'm listening. What's so funny? You giving us lessons on politics. And what makes me laugh, is that I ask myself what can these Germans teach us? A country ashamed and humiliated by its history. A nation in total decadence. Without their own will and morals. That's what you should make a documentary about. The shame of being German. You've got enough material there. I don't know why you are here. Are we done? Cut, please. Thanks everyone. It's always good to have a little action on film. Leave it! Calm down. We'll be seen all over Europe. He is making us look like idiots. Come on, you're so paranoid. What? -Easy. -What are you going to do? Pussy. Long live president Allende! Long live! Go study! Open the door. No. You made me cry. Aren't you gonna console me? I cry without tears... Inés, no. ...that way no one ever knows. I've cried so much for you. For us. Haven't you cried for me? Tell me. Have you cried for me? -Ma'am, your son is outside. -Tell him to come in. He doesn't want to, he said for you to come out. He can go to hell. That's what I told him you would say, but he still didn't want to come in. Hi. Down. Get down, get down. What's going on? Gerardo Ramirez. Member of Fatherland and Liberty reappears. -What does it say there, mom? -I don't know, I can't see. Get down, Ron. Stop it, Ron. Here's dad. Shall I read the caption? Ramirez, then member of Fatherland and Liberty, Antonio Sanfuentes, deceased, and the now prestigious lawyer, Justo Ebner. -So, what's the problem? -I'll continue... Extreme anti-Marxists who attempted a revolution with whisky and caviar. More tasteful than the cheap wine and empanadas revolution the others wanted. There's more. Look, this is highlighted. Aide Silva's daughter has asked for the case to be reopened to investigate her father's murder. What does this have to do with us? Then don't appear in the newspapers. Is that an order? I'm not going to expose my children to any obscure situations. And that's a threat. Don't kiss me. Tell dad that things are going really well at the office. We're getting more clients than ever before. One said "hopefully you'll be as brave as your old man". That's great. The Vatican won't give this boy the divorce, don't trust him. Ron, come on. I want to express my gratitude. These classrooms will fulfill the dreams of an entire community. Dreams of a more dignified life, that only a good education with solid values, can provide. I would like to especially thank the Mirasol Foundation, present today, And everyone who made this marvel possible. Thanks. Congratulations, Ricardo. Thanks. It's good to see you here. Inesita. I thought you weren't coming. Why did you think I wasn't coming, Mr. Ricardo? I was calling you all morning. Inés, don't forget about the lunch. -Why don't we talk later. -The school looks lovely. -Thank you. -Thank you. I imagine you've seen the paper. -Mr. Ricardo, it's very kind of you. -Thank you. -Are you trying to kill Justo and me? -Don't exaggerate. -I'm not exaggerating. -I've come to hand in my notice. I'll show you the school, come. Come with me. It was your turn, woman. Okay, fine. What does it matter, tomorrow everyone will forget about it. It's written in a decent newspaper, in your newspaper. -So many things are written. -Someone needs to defend our ideas. Are we going to let the Left keep writing this country's history? Nobody reads history books. Nobody reads newspapers, they just look at the photos. -Don't worry so much. -But we do worry. Who's going to throw in your face a little sin that happened... God knows how many years ago. Come on, please. You know no one's a saint. What's the name of that senator who was bragging about trying to kill Pinochet? -He's a communist, he doesn't count. -That's true. Look how lucky these kids are. If there's something really tormenting you, confess it. But with a priest, on your own. You're a decent person. Everyone knows that. We're going to fill this with houses. Look. I'll offer you an interview, so you can tell your version. We don't have a version. Well, invent one. We'll go to your house, you tell us about how you and Justo juggle being married, grandparents with professional careers and we'll take some nice photos. And that's it. You have nothing to hide. Hey, I like your outfit. You look like a "minion". -What's that? -A cartoon. You're real famous. -Really? -Yes. There's photos of you online everywhere. People contact us from the north, the south, from all over. We've got more than 13,000 followers, we get like 50 new ones everyday. Send them a message. Tell them: "Our hand won't shake when the moment arrives". Chile will be for Chileans again. -Poetic! -Could you get in my house? Yeah. But the cops didn't leave anything. -Nothing? -Nothing. They took all your "toys". Should I ask for more? Sure. Everything stays as planned. Or are you getting scared? Look at this. -Why didn't you wear a shirt? -Just the bra is better. Cigarette? Thanks. COPPER NATIONALIZATION ARMED FORCES MARXISM CONFUSION Careful. Hurry up, man! Ready? Shit! Help me! Help! It was as if... I was killing a dog... Breathing in smoke. Like I'd gone crazy. Did you wish he'd died? No. I don't think so. I have thought about killing him. Right now there are people fighting in a war. Lots of wars. And me, here... ...in this shitty country. So we had to invent a war, to die soon. How shameful being an old woman. I want to spend this short life truly in love. With you. I've already decided. Gerardo, this is for real. Hold on. What are you laughing at? Nothing. It's alright. -No, it's not alright. -It's alright. Don't you realize how fucked up this country is and you're laughing. He's escaping! Fucking Hatian, get down! Leave him! Let go of him! The Ministry of Health's opinions given to this newspaper discourage any future private ventures in the health sector. Is it true french fries are good for Alzheimer's? Of course. And for the pains of love. -Let's keep that in the minutes please. -I'll continue and finish. Those affected will be the thousands of patients who choose us freely, as well as risking the jobs of hundreds of employees. Signed... My name is missing. You'll have to print it again. They asked me for it like that. They asked you for it like that? Who did? Who asked you, dear? I asked Ximena to keep your name out. And why? Because the political aspect is so complicated and with everything they're saying... falsely. It's just to avoid any problems. It's best if your name doesn't show up for a while. On behalf of the directory, at least in the press. Only that. -Did you know about this? -No. Ximena didn't know... -Does Ricardo know? -Yes. He always knows everything. -Did you meet? -It was an email. Just a few emails. We needed to check. Okay. Careful with those computers. Of course. Great, I think it's fantastic. I completely understand. Really? Yes. I'd have done the same. -That's great you understand. -It's nothing personal. Of course not. Okay, you sign it then. Fucking misogynists. Don't take it like that. Pussies. Olga? -How's it going? -Great. Nuts? Thank you. -Excuse me. -Hello, Justo. They're over there. It's five dollars for each truck driver and ten dollars for each bus driver. Tell them that if they don't go to work tomorrow, they'll get more. Everyday. But since money doesn't buy happiness, we still have to threaten them. It's not a joke. I'm worried. Despite everything we're doing, it feels like there are more and more communists. That's why we're doing this. If we had to kill them one by one, we'd never finish. How do we change the feeling? I don't know. You tell me. I think we should't be afraid to start a war. A real war. Our army is spirit. Our armed forces live off the veneration of the soldier's blood. The blood of a dead king is what makes the people's blood sting. But we don't have a king to worship. A martyr. Someone has to die. Today the patriots will not work. We strike against the Marxist government! Power to the people! Fascists! This will cause pain in the militia. The indignation of the free people. It will be a volcano of fury. I'm willing. Kill me. Excuse me, Antonio. I value and I'm grateful for the sacrifice you're making for everyone but what would we do without our leader? It would mean the end of our nationalist dream. I... ...offer myself to take your place. Antonio. Antonio! Justo has his family, his son. Plus he's too posh. Someone like me should die. It would be an honor. I love you and... I'll never let you down... you can always count on me. Nationalism! Nationalism! Papa-Mike-Tango! Emergency! Emergency! Fire in the engine! Altitude of 3500 feet Received, please confirm the emergency and your position. Gerardo Ramírez was on a reconnaissance flight for Marxist guerilla camps. To take photographs so the army believe us. We are sure that he was attacked by anti-air armament. Now, we demand that the government stop slandering us and worry about the real subversives. We've come peacefully, to honour a brave and patriotic young Chilean. A martyr in the fight for freedom. Gerardo... From death, transform into the night star. Guide us with your eternal heroic light. We won't forget you, young warrior. In your name, we will protect the Fatherland and Liberty. FATHERLAND AND LIBERTY, BIDS A PAINFUL FAREWELL TO THEIR YOUNG MARTYR, GERARDO RAMÍREZ. Here! Hey... What? We have to celebrate. Are you happy? Yes. Justo... Justo, please. Justo, I can't breathe. Justo... Justo, please. Stop. Stop, please. I'm sorry. It's over. It's over now. We need to keep calm now. We haven't been calm for a long time. It's true. It's over. It's over now. -You're really drunk. -No. No? Yes. Do you want some? Thanks. Gerardo's going to come and take you away forever. That's your dream isn't it? I didn't tell you. I'm resigning as columnist for the newspaper. I've had enough of so much stupidity. He's going to take you away. Hi, Sonia! Hi, the birthday girls are here! Congratulations, my love. Hi, sweetheart. I've got a gift for you, but it's a surprise. -Hi, mom. -Hi. -How are you? -Hi. And their classmates? It was better not to invite them. It would be too much for dad. Then you eat all the jello and sandwiches and take all the goodie bags home. -Okay, great. -Go ahead. Make yourself at home. There we go, kids... Champagne... Pour them. Ceci, come. Hurry! Hello, dad. Hi. -Whisky? -I've got champagne, thanks. -Where's the champagne? -There. Today, yes. We're celebrating. -It's a pleasure. -Hi. It's Rebecca, dad. You've met her before. I'll help you. -No, no. -Leave him. Did you take your medication? God damn it! Dad, what the hell are you doing? Happiness! Happiness! It's an English tradition! It is a tradition. Really lovely tradition. If it bothers you that much, leave. Please bring another bottle, dear. This is what you were so worried about, right? -I can't hear you. -Answer him. I can't hear you. Look, dad. I don't care that my kids see you acting like a clown on the girls' birthday, because they're used to it. What I do care about is the circus you two created years ago. And that my family and I have to face the consequences now. I really made a mistake. I brought you up like a rich boy, in a free country. Look at you. Where would your kids be now if Marxism had won? Happy in a private school in Miami. Ungrateful! Ungrateful! Mom! Spoilt fucking brat. Come on Don Justo! The tennis hasn't finished yet. Where is everybody? In the bathroom. How could you leave them alone? It's fine. Open the gate please. Woman! Get out. I said get out. Get out. You don't fool me. I said get out. Get out! Get out! Sir! Are you willing to give your life for your ideals? Yes, sir! Sir! Are you willing to give your life for your ideals? Yes, sir! We finally have news from Santiago. Bad news. Things got really fucked up. Everyone fled. What is the order? Take down the camp and disband. The guys need to go back to their homes. I'll be taking people back all night. -And where are we going? -You're staying here. They said it's not time to come back to life yet. What? Those are the orders from above. There is only one captain on a ship. Gerardo. What happened to you two? You left me here on my own. We went into hiding. We had a really bad time. Be grateful you were here. -There's a plan. -A plan from who? From above. High up. The Navy is planning a coup. They say all the officers are on board. But they need the Left to kill someone high up. -Who? -We don't know yet. The important thing is to pass as a comunist. So we're doing it? Yes, you are the chosen one. Can we count on you? Nobody will blame it on our dead martyr. -Hi. -Hi. He even looks innocent. Yes. Please, let's not waste any more time. Ask them to take him away. and let's see another patient. So, it's final? Yes, he's going to stay hospitalized. He's going to stay here, hospitalized. But who decided that? What do you mean? All of us, you, Sepulveda, me, the team treating him. Yes, look. -You just need to sign here. -I'm not inventing this. We talked about it in this room and that he could face a trial. Okay, I'll see to it. I'll call another colleague. Do it. I'll pretend that I didn't hear that last part. Look, Nadia. You don't learn this at university. This is the real world. Okay? Please, sign it. I'll see you at lunch. Can you leave us on our own, please? Thank you. Mr. Ramirez. Hello. Aren't you afraid? Of what? To be alone with a mentally-ill patient. With everything that I've read about you, yes, I should be afraid. What have you read? That you're famous. I didn't know. Famous for being a murderer. Other than the young man you hit with your car, how many people have you killed? What are you laughing at? Aren't there any doctors behind the glass today? Answer the question. Ok, I'll tell you. Let's see. A woman came. To see you. Do you know her? Because she says that she's your friend. She's convinced us that you have mental disorders. That you have always had mental disorders. She told us that the crimes you committed before and now are because you are crazy. You know what? She convinced us. So us doctors have decided that you have to stay here. Aren't you happy? It doesn't matter if you're not. The important thing is that you don't have to go to jail, even though everyone thinks that you should rot in there. But don't feel bad, you're not the only one. But if you have any sense of justice, I'll happily give you a lobotomy. Or I can fill you with so many drugs that you won't be able to cough without shitting yourself. Excuse me. Your friends abandoned you. Your own people, fucking Nazi. You're going to be proud of me. When you read the newspapers... We're ready here! -Did you hear me? -Let go of me. Open the window, please, it smells like skunk in here. So make him take a shower. Paw! Paw! Bad dog, hey! Don't even think about it. You lucked out, man. I need to take a shit. Don't leave without me. Don't count on me. I'm not going to be part of this. Justo is giving us a little time. On our own. He asked me to tell you that I don't love you anymore. Tell me then. I love you. What does he know? Everything. -Is he armed? -Yes. But he won't kill you now. He needs you for what they've sent us to do. But sooner or later he will kill you. -Let him try. -And then he'll kill me. I know him. I'm trying to fuckin' work! Shit! A woman came to see me at the office. Jorge Silva's daughter. President Allende's aide. The one who was killed. -Do you know her? -No. -She asked for you. -Me? Yes, you. I agreed that I would arrange for you to meet. Are you an idiot? What's wrong with you? Dad, there's no legal implications, she wants to know the truth. How can it have no legal implications, are you nuts? I'll tell you the truth, man. Your mother and I were part of a brave and majoritarian civil defense against a government who tried to turn this country into another Cuba. That's the truth, man. The rest is just peanuts. They're lies. And the amount of deaths? What an insignificant amount of deaths compared to what it could have been with a civil war in this country. I'd like to have seen you there, man. Fuckin' damn it. -How's the office? -Fine, fine. Let go of me! Gerardo! Come! Grab him! Let go of me! Put this on. Come on! This way! Hurry! Hurry up! Run! DO NOT CROSS -Okay! -Open up! They let you free. -I don't have anything ready. -I need some pants. And your boss' truck. Anything else? Yes. I don't get you. You ran over a guy, they put you in jail and now, you are in a hurry. We are being watched online. I could only get four shitty weapons. Show me. Gun. Bullets. Cigarette. ALTHOUGH YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT, WE WILL WIN If something goes wrong, or we get separated, we meet back here. Nothing will go wrong. Hurry up. Remember that we're lefties, we're from the MIR. Come on, comrades! Forward without compromise! The people united shall never be defeated! Allende! Allende! The people defends you! Get in. Long live the government and the Popular Unity! Long live president Allende! Workers with the popular government! What are you doing here? Get the hell out of here! The Chilean Navy is here! He's a marine. Of course. I'm not going to shoot a soldier. Hey... Gerardo. He's Allende's aide. A traitor. Everything will be fine. Trust me. Go on, now! Throw it! Motherfucker! Do it for Chile. Military scum! Run, let's go! Come on, man! Get me out of here. I'm begging you. Congratulations! You're a hero. Murderer! You killed a soldier! Run away, fucker. Justo. Justo. Inés. Don't come closer. What, are you going to kill me? Kill me. Kill me. Isn't that why you came here? Touch me. Look at me. Shame on you. You're still the same. I went to your house. Disgusting. A war hero living like a rat. What did you do with your life? Nothing. Coward. Fuckin' whore. Get up. Get up, you piece of shit! Let me go. In the future they will see us as heroes of liberty. The same way we see heroes of the Independence. In each generation there are some who are in charge of passing the torch of truth, freedom and justice. The forgotten men and women of this country will never be forgotten again. This is Chile! And here we speak Chilean. LIGHT AFTER THE DARK Hi. Here we are. What's your perfect Christmas? All the family together, enjoying good health. What gifts do you like to receive? My grandchildrens' drawings. Especially yours. A gift for the country? Peace, love and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
