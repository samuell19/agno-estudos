(bright music) (tense percussive music) (ominous music) (glass crashes) (woman gasps) (gunfire roaring) (woman shrieks) (man groans) (man groaning) (man groans) (helicopter buzzing) (helicopter approaches) - [Ivan] Comrade Lydia, what's the first precaution when using a baby carriage to trick a limousine into stopping? - [Lydia] Make sure the carriage is well in front of you in case the limousine doesn't stop. - Very good. It's a shame one of our former graduates didn't remember that. I want you to commit this man's face to memory. This gentleman made four of our very best agents pay dearly for a very stupid mistake. - [Lydia] Who is this man, Comrade? - This man is a special agent for the United States Central Intelligence Agency, with an unusually broad charter. After the fiasco in Iran, the director of the CIA was determined to organize a special force completely outside the normal channels. The man who was put in charge of this special unit is codenamed The Soldier. - How many men are in this unit, Comrade? - There are only five, but each one is superbly well-trained. One more thing. The Soldier is required to report only to the director of the CIA. But lately, he's been acting very independently. Very much on his own. This makes him even more dangerous. (ominous music) (suspenseful music) - 11 o'clock! Look out! Plutonium Transport, mayday, mayday! Route one-zero-four! - Plutonium Transport, come on back. (blast roars) Plutonium transport, come on back. (rocket whooshes) (blast roars) (truck thuds) (guard screams) Shit. (siren wails) (blast roars) (ominous music) (siren wailing) (siren approaching) (sinister music) The fuck is going on here? You guys, get down. Get down here! Get your hands up. Up! Get your hands up! Slowly. (shotgun roars) (trooper grunts) (trooper groaning) (police radio squawking) (haunting music) (blast roars) (suspenseful music) (KGB agents chatting in Russian) - Good morning. Where do you live? - New York. - And you guys? - New York. - New York. - What is your citizenship? - US. - And you three? - US. - Where are you going? - See the falls. - What are you carrying in your automobile other than your personal clothing? - Cameras. - Are you carrying any commercial goods, firearms, or anything you intend to leave in Canada? - Nope. - Okay, have a nice day. (suspenseful music) (KGB agents chatting in Russian) (ominous music) (timer ticking) - Exactly 53 minutes ago, we received the following statement, from which I quote: "It is now 8 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time. Unless within the next 96 hours Israel withdraws its settlements from the West Bank of the Jordan River, we will detonate a nuclear device in the center of the Ghawar oilfields." - What would that mean? - [Defense Secretary] If a nuclear device detonated at the center of the Ghawar oilfields in Saudi Arabia, it would render 50% of the world's known supply of petroleum unusable for 300 years. - [Prime Minister] Do you think this threat is real, Susan? - I'm not sure, but we must remember that two days ago, plutonium was stolen from a transportation convoy in the US. And even convention explosives jacketed in plutonium would make an extremely dangerous weapon. - Would would the practical effects of such a blast be? - [Defense Secretary] For the Americans, it would be a disaster of almost unimaginable proportions. The last so-called oil shortage was less than 3%. We are talking about 50. 50%. The world as we know it would end. - What about us? - We've been farmers before. We could be farmers again. But there is something else you must remember. A debacle of this magnitude would aid the Russians enormously. As the West collapsed, communism would spread. I needn't remind you of how the communists feel about Israel, or about any religious country for that matter. - What about the demands? - [Prime Minister] I don't know what the Americans are going to do, but I do know that we are not going to get off the West Bank. (ominous music) (prisoner grunting) (prisoner grunting) (prisoner groans) - Is this him? (tense music) Is this him? (prisoner screams) (gunshot roars) (prisoner gurgles) (ominous music) (informant sobbing) He can't identify you now. I want the people who stole the plutonium. Give us two more terrorists, we'll turn you over to our plastic surgeon and you can start a new life, okay? Here are the photos. Welcome back. You're the best double agent we've ever had. (adhesive rips) - Anything happen while I was away? - It appears there are three possibilities. First, that the entire threat is hogwash. Second, that it is real, and we can persuade the Israelis to withdraw. And third, that we must throw the Israelis off the West Bank in order to save our oil supply. - Um, on July 24th, a test of the Rapid Deployment Force was conducted. Three helicopters collided, which resulted in the loss of 18 lives. One plane flew too high, was picked up by enemy radar. And six tanks and 23 combat rifles malfunctioned. The goal of the exercise was a simulated recapture of a Saudi oilfield allegedly held by the Iraqi army, which is estimated to be 17 times less powerful than the Israeli army. The computer felt that the Iraqis would have maintained control of the oilfield. I would have to say that the chances of us throwing the Israelis off the West Bank with conventional weapons is zero. - Then we must consider other means. I hereby order you, General, to formulate contingency plans for a full-scale attack on Israel, if necessary. We must be prepared for any eventuality. There are only 93 hours left. Have the director of the CIA call me in my private study immediately. (committee chattering) (phone buzzes) You've been briefed? - Yes, Mr. President. - Of course, I cannot let 50% of the world's oil supplies be destroyed under any circumstances. I must be prepared to drive the Israelis off the West Bank. - Yes, Mr. President. - On the other hand, I want to know who the fuck is behind this. - Yes, Mr. President. - I direct you to organize an immediate covert operation in that regard. There are only 93 hours left. - I have just the man for the job, sir. - I want him to stop them, any way he can. Needless to say, if he screws up, I don't know anything about it. Is that understood? - Understood, Mr. President.

(knock at door) - Come in. (door opens and shuts) One hell of a stunt you pulled in Philadelphia. - Hey, before I closed her show, that bitch and her baby carriage took out four diplomatic limousines and 12 innocent people. Three of 'em were children. - All right. Have you seen the latest? - No. Don't tell me, let me guess. The stuff they got is weapons-grade, the plans for the bomb check out, and the Israelis won't budge, hmm? - What do you think we should do? - Well, I'd like to talk to the Russians, because if they're not behind this, they sure as hell know who is. - You know I can't authorize that. - I'm not asking you to. - Inev Dracha. He's in Saint Anton, Austria, allegedly on a skiing vacation. There's a fighter-bomber at Andrews Air Force Base that you could borrow. - [The Soldier] Think we can still trust Dracha? - [Director] He's absolutely loyal to the KGB, but he's always been straight with us in the past. (door shuts) (suspenseful music) (torch hisses) (adhesive crackling) (torch clicks off) (keys rattle) (pensive music) (resort announcer speaking German) - [The Soldier] I don't think it's terrorists, Dracha. I think it's renegade KGB. - What does the rest of the CIA think of this idea of yours? - [The Soldier] Well, I haven't told anyone yet. - [Dracha] I see. (ominous music) - [The Soldier] What are you doing? (motor whirs) Hey. Hey, what are you doing? Hey! What the hell are you doing? Dracha! What are you doing? Jesus Christ. (brakes squeal) Dracha! (ominous music) (rocket whooshes) (blast roars) (tense music) (skier grunting) (gunshots popping) (The Soldier grunts) (crowd yelps) (gunshots popping) (gunfire rattles) (skier groaning) (gunfire rattling) (skier screaming) (crowd screams) (skier groans) (crowd murmuring) Now tell me, is it terrorists, or is it the Russians? Huh? - We're behind it. It has gotta go off. (stammering) I don't know where the bomb is. But it's gotta go off. (skier pants and groans) (ominous music) (woman speaking Russian) - [Woman] Computer Center, hello? - What's the time in Saint Anton, Austria? - [Woman] 1:33 a.m. - Thank you. (door shuts) - [The Soldier] Throw me your gun. - How'd you get in here? - Just come on, throw me your gun. Now get me a secure line to CIA Headquarters in Washington. Come on. - How about yourself? (phone rings) - Yeah? - They tried to terminate me. - What? - They're changing the game in a major way. Now write this down. I want to make an on-the-record recommendation. (blast roars) (director screaming) - Put 'em down. Put 'em down, it's okay. - Look, I'm a legitimate agent and I'm talking to the head of the CIA in Washington. Want to check for yourself, go on. - Hello? (director screaming) Hello? Full of shit. (scoffs) The line's dead. (footsteps running) (gunfire roars) (glass crashes) (alarm blaring) (tense music) (The Soldier grunts) (gunfire popping) (siren wails) - We got him. He's turning onto the Ku'damm. (tires screech) (siren approaching) - There he is! (tires squeal) (engine revs) (siren wailing) (tires screech) (tires screeching) (sirens wailing) (engine revs) (tires screech) (sirens approaching) (tires screech) - Freeze! You're standing on the sovereign territory of the State of Israel, with weapons in your hands. - He broke in the US Consulate and claimed he was calling the CIA in Washington. He's obviously a nut. - You have 10 seconds before I consider this an act of war and order my commanders to start shooting. - But I don't think you understand the situation. (rifle cocks) - Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. It's been a long time. - Yeah, too long. - Anything? - There's nothing in the director's files. We don't even know his codename, much less how to get in touch with him. - That's just great. (helicopter buzzing) (man shouting prayers) - [Pilot] We have The Soldier. He is in the Israeli Consulate in Berlin with Michael. (man shouting prayers) - Tel Aviv thinks it's possible you're right. They are afraid the Americans might try to throw us off the West Bank. The head of covert operations for Mossad just arrived. If you can convince her, it's a go. - Thank you, Michael. - Sure. - Thanks. The Americans say that you are not authorized to be in Europe. - They're right. Speak to the director of the CIA. He knows why I'm here. - Is he the only one that knows that you are here? - Yes. - That's too bad, because he's dead. The Americans think that you killed him. - Yeah? What do you think? - Why did you break into the US Consulate? - I was trying to make contact with him. The Russians almost got me and I didn't feel like trusting anybody. - Well, then why would you trust me? And for that matter, why should I trust you? - Well, I don't have any choice, and in a way, you may not either. - You might be right. But the plan that you outlined to Michael is a little scary, isn't it? - Yeah, it is. But do you have a better one? - I wish I did.

Get me the president of the United States, immediately. (pensive music) - [Tower] Four Nine Sugar, this is an emergency. Call the office immediately. - Four Nine Sugar. (president speaking French) (helicopter buzzing) - [Pilot] You have a call from the office. Setting down. (aide speaking German) - How much oil would this bomb contaminate? - 50% of the world's known reserves for 300 years. - I'm in. - I'm in. - Mm-hmm. - I'm in. - Good. Late one night, during the last days of his administration, President Nixon put the 82nd Nuclear Strike Force on red alert for no apparent reason. The CIA was afraid the man was losing his mind. (ominous music) We wanted to make sure that no matter what he did, we could still obtain access to SAC Headquarters or any missile silo in the United States. - Do you think these codes still work? - Yes. When I programmed these override codes into the SAC computer I made sure that they could never be changed, erased, or located. - I'm surprised it's so compact. - Yeah. Takes a lot less to end the world than you might imagine. You go to Kansas.I'll go to East Berlin and play guts poker with the Russians. You'll know if the oilfield blows. Let's hope we make it. - Okay. Shalom. - Hey. What's up? - I was just reporting to Michael. He wanted to keep up with my whereabouts. - Okay, good. - So I told him that I was going to stay here tonight. - Oh, okay, fine. I'll go sack out on the couch. - Oh, don't be so fucking coy. I mean, we're on the eve of destruction and you're acting like some nervous kid? I don't want you to sleep on the couch. (pensive music) Please. I think someone's watching us. - [The Soldier] I hope so. That's why I came to the wall. I want to make sure the Russians know we're here. (printer buzzes) - Berlin. (pensive music) - Jesus. - [Quartus] What's wrong? - So fucking flat. - What'd you expect? Colorado? (Tribus chuckles) - Thank you. - It's okay, darling. Those are the men who rent the barn. (tense percussive music) - Good evening, sir. May I see your identification? What's the code? - Sky blue ice dawn. (keyboard clacking) - Okay. (tense music) (phone rings) - Silo 8. - Security's coming. Two of them. - Thanks. Good evening, Colonel. - Good evening. Captain, check out the box. Sergeant, get me Central Control. Thank you. (suspenseful music) (phone beeps) - Central Control. - Central, this is Remote 8. We're going to replace some printed circuit boards, so you're going to lose some of your monitors for a while. - Roger, Remote 8. (sergeant groans) (ominous music) - Do it. (lock buzzes) (keypad beeping) (elevator hums) (air cylinder hisses) (phone ringing) - Firing Room. - Hi, I'm Captain Eastland and this is Colonel Johnson. We're here to replace some printed circuit boards. - Okay, please put both of your photo identification cards into the slot and step in front of the peephole one at a time. (alert beeps) Okay, next. (alert beeps) Okay, what's the code? - Georgia rain. (keyboard clacking) - Gentlemen, the door'll only open for five seconds, so make sure you hurry in. (lock buzzing) (tense music) (guard groans) (dart gun whizzes) - How long will it take? - The book says 20 minutes. - We've only got 24. - How much time do we have? - 23 minutes, sir. - If we launch an attack against the Israeli positions on the West Bank, how long will it be before they know we're coming? - They couldn't possibly know for at least 15 minutes. - Start the attack. 15 minutes from now, issue an ultimatum. If the Israelis don't withdraw, we're going to throw 'em off. - Very well, sir. (jet engines roaring) (tires screeching) (ominous music) (phone rings) - Hello? - [Officer] The Americans just launched a fleet of F-14s from a carrier off Greece. We think they're heading for the West Bank. - If they cross into our airspace, commence a full-scale nuclear attack on the Saudi oilfields. - [Officer] Yes, sir. - The Americans are moving towards the West Bank. (sinister music) - Jesus. Let's cross into East Berlin at Checkpoint Charlie and have a little talk with the Russians, hmm? (engine revs) (tires screech) - How long have those monitors been down? - Four or five minutes. (tense music) (line rings) (guard grunting) (phone ringing) (officers chatting indistinctly) (line ringing) - Check out Remote 8 fast. (engine revs) (tires screech) (siren wailing) - Embassy Patrol, this is Unit 2. We're heading towards Bernauer Strasse, over. - All right, turn right here. (tires screech) (sirens wailing) (tires screech) (tires screech) - Good. Come on, one or two? Is it one or two? Okay. Shut it down. (switches clicking) (siren wailing) - [Pilot] Central Control, this is Cobra Chopper 26. We're going in to check out Missile Silo 8. - [Control] Roger, 26.

(tense music) (alarm beeping) (tires screeching) (siren wailing) - Turn right. Let's lose them. (engine revving) (alarm beeping) (motors whirring) - Oh my god. (alarm whooping) (engine revs) (alarm whooping) - Michael and I figured it out. If you hit it at 85 in third gear, we'll make it to the Russian side.

I've always wanted to see Moscow. However, in about, oh, about nine minutes, that will no longer be possible. - What do you mean? - I mean that four of my friends have control of 40 megatons of ICBMs sitting in a silo in Smith Center, Kansas, and if the bomb in the oilfield goes off, they're gonna nuke Moscow. - You're full of shit. (The Soldier scoffs) - Maybe. (steam hissing) (alarm whoops) (pensive music) (speaking Russian) (mellow music) - [Paratrooper] Move up. Here we go. (timer ticking) (timer stops) (alarm whoops) (steam hissing) (silo powering down) (alarm whoops) (silo powering down) (doors clang) - [Susan] Why did you say "maybe"? - [The Soldier] At the time it seemed like the right choice. - [Susan] I suppose it's hard to argue with success. (mellow music)
