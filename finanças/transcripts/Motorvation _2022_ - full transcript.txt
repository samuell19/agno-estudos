Hi there. My name is, uh, Robert Melvin, but, uh, people call me Fatty Melvin. It's been a nickname since I was a kid. I aspire to be a motivational speaker, like my big brother, James. But, uh, right now I am a corporate facilities technician at a company run by Lisa Cohen. She's really cool, though. You'll see her soon, yeah. If you dream it, you can achieve it. If you can dream it, you can achieve it. Anyway, well, this is my story. Time to chase the American dream. Ha-ha-ha. Ms. Cohen, the ball is in your court. All you have to do is sign. This is a great deal, Lisa. You're gonna be a millionaire. I just feel like I'm signing away my baby. For a million dollars. That didn't sound right. No. Ms. Cohen, we promise to take care of you, and your million dollar baby. And you're gonna keep everything here, right? No outsourcing? No, everything will remain exactly as it is. You can trust us, Ms. Cohen. We will always make the right choice. Man. What's that? It's nobody, just the janitor. Ah, good, perfect. What is a janitor? Am I saying that right? Yanitor. Must be someone who eats a lot. Don't ever be a janitor. - Hey, hey. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Way to go, Fatty, alright. - Hey, Bob. How you doing? Looking forward to your brother's book signing tonight. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hope to see you there, Bob. - Alright, sounds good. - Alright. Hey, vote Bob. Oh, yeah, yeah, uh, cool. See you there, Bob. Ooh, ooh, ooh. Finally. Robert? Hey, you okay? They're the wrong color. I said red. It's okay, Dad. I can go get 'em. I, but I... I thought you said blue. No, red. You're gonna drive me to drink. It's okay. You okay? Yeah. It's good to see you. Wow, this is your fifth book launch. When are you gonna have one? I, I dunno. I'm working on it. Ah, come on, seriously, - you should write a book. - Yeah. I'll be the first one to buy it. Really? Don't worry, I'll go get the balloons. You sure? Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Whoa. Who's is... Ah, no. Not too shabby, right? This is yours? No way. This is the one. This is the one you've always wanted. Yeah. It's a real Lamborghini. Yeah. It's great. Scratch this off the list. Whoa. Come on, get in. - Really? - Yeah. Is this from all your book sales? Uh... No, no, no. This is, uh, one of my many perks for my new gig. Congratulations. This is awesome. Yeah. Yeah, uh, I'm a spokesperson for them, you know. Motivational speaker, lots of travel, high salary. I go around all America, speak to all businesses. Can I hear the engine? Oh yeah. This is amazing. This is a car you've always dreamed of getting. Yeah. That's amazing. It is, it's just... It's just a car. Yeah, but it's... Oh my gosh. It's great. You know, the funny thing is, I always thought I would feel a little different. Is it, like, do you know what the cylinders are? Is it like a horsepower thing? I mean, I really don't know anything about it. It's so cool. I better go get those balloons, huh? Oh, yeah, okay, sure. See ya. Bye. Hey, Fatty. I am so sorry for your loss. James was truly one of a kind. In times like this, when it seems like there's no one to turn to, you have a community of friends behind you, Fatty. Do not hesitate to reach out. Fatty, I just heard about the accident. I'm praying for you, buddy. There will never be another like James. He has truly left behind a legacy. Now I just got off the phone with Frank. He wants us to coax this guy, see if we can bring him to our side, maybe make a him our motivational speaker. - That'd be fantastic. - Exactly. So we wanna make sure that he is as comfortable as possible. Get him a water. - Okay. - Water. Hey, Robert? How you feeling? Oh, yeah, um, I'm okay. I'm fine. Okay, well, I know this is sudden, but I have your brother's will. And according to it, he left this business to you. What? That can't be right? There must be some mistake. No, no, no. No mistake. It's all here. I put the will in a box for you, and he left this box for you as well. And I think he also left the book he might have been working on. Could be worth some money. Robert, you okay? Oh, I... Oh. Can we get you anything? Ah, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna, uh, use the restroom. Okay, um... I'm fine. Is he coming back? Yes. Hi, James. This is Lisa Cohen from Personal Best. I know Jan gave you the details, but I just wanted to say that we're all very excited to have you give your motivational speech this week. I look forward to meeting you. What are you doing? You're a terrible motivational speaker. Hi, everybody. My name is Fatty Melvin, and I am a motivational speaker. Who wants to be motivated? Okay. You know, your brain is like a computer. Are you married? No, I'm a swinging bachelor. Well, then do you have a girlfriend? No, I still haven't found that lucky lady. Do you think it's because you are so fat, or because you're so old? I need a paper bag. Fear is the biggest thing keeping us from being the person we're meant to be. Fear isn't real. It's an imaginary monster lurking in the shadows. And the only way to defeat it is to expose it by facing it head-on. Only when we run at fear, will fear run away. Fear isn't real. There you go. All right? Fatty? Yeah. - You ready to go? - Yeah. Yeah? All right, here we go. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the second annual Plastic Ware conference. Yeah, woo! We are so excited to bring you our favorite motivational speaker, Fatty Melvin. Oh. Ugh. Who wants to dream? I do! Who wants to dream the American dream? Who wants to dream the American dream with Plastic Ware? Well, now you can. I see dreamers who have woken up, and I'm telling you all it's time to dream again. I want you to think about all those amazing things. A new car, a new boat, a jet plane, a make-up kit for the ladies, a new dress, to go to Mars, whatever. There is no dream too small with Plastic Ware. Let theses images soak in. You suck. All right, woo! I'm gonna do something now. I'm gonna walk out here into the audience, 'cause I really wanna connect with you all. What's your dream? I wanna be a professional hugger. All right. Well, a professional hugger is weird. What about you? To be the next Miss USA. Whoa, Miss USA. A full head of hair? I want a new Ferrari. A vacation to Italy. Laptop. All right, yeah! A new laptop. Uh, a used laptop. A used laptop? All right. What about you, NFL legend, Rodney Peete? You validate parking? Rodney Peete, woo, yeah! Everyone, Rodney Peete in the house. Thank you. Anyone else? Okay. Oh, that's what I wanna talk about. Okay. All those dreams can come true right now with Plastic Ware. It's not a pyramid scheme, but rather, but rather a multi-level marketing company that offers an exciting opportunity to have all your heart's desires come true by becoming a Plastic Ware representative. All right. With Plastic Ware, it's time to inflate your life. Who's with me? Ooh. When one door closes, another door is always gonna open. All right. Hey, Rodney. Thank you. America. Hey, Fatty. Oh, hi, Kathy. How you doing? Oh, not bad. Can I get you started with some coffee? Oh, that'd be great, thank you. All right, I'll be right back. Oh, hey, do you want a freshly baked do- - Oh, they're not bad. This belong to you? If you plant the right seeds in life, water them, let the sun come down on them. They will come to fruition. Hey, Dad. If you dream it, you can achieve it. Got you some barbecue, Dad. You know, just the way you like it. If you plant the right seeds in life, water them, let the sun come down on them. Oh, I've been doing some, uh, motivational talks, you know? Uh... If you dream it- - It's not as good as James, but, you know, I'm trying. Oh, remember what James used to say? If you can dream it, you can achieve it. I guess that's what I'm trying to do. If you plant the right seeds in life, water them, let the sun come down on them. I'll start the grill. They will come to fruition. If you dream it, you can achieve it. Hey, babe. I just wanted to call and say I'm not gonna make it. I would've called sooner, but I'm with someone very muy importante. You get it. And that's why I love us. All right, see you later. Oh, hey, make sure you eat a salad. Derek out. Is your party still gonna show up? He's not coming. Would you care to order anything? Mmhmm. I like a large pizza. Mmhmm. And a large cheeseburger with two patties well done. And a baked potato with bacon and sour cream. And a snow cone. A really big snow cone with great flavor. And a little bit of vodka on the top of it, and, like, a little cherry and a little straw. Okay. I would also like a barrel of wine. Robert. Dan, can we come in and remove the centerpiece from the table? Dan? Nevermind. Robert, thank you for coming in today. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it for you. The main point is this. Your father used the family home as capital to, uh, set up James' business. The bank is gonna foreclose on the house, unless we can come up with a viable solution. What about writing a book? Books sell. Your brother had a solid fan base. Why not pick up where he left off? I'm sure you can write something motivational, you know? Or just... Dan, can we move the- - It's o- - No, no. No, it's okay. Dan? You know, or something with a little more pizzazz. Pizza? Pizzazz. Pizzazz? Yes. Pizzazz. Pizzazz. Pizzazz. Your story. Your story. Pizzazz. Hey, Janet. Oh, my flights in about an hour or so. I gotta dash. They brought in some cheap motivational speaker to help with the transition. I don't know who it is. I never ask these things. Hey, guess what? Contracts have all gone through. I say we start with the usual layoffs, we outsource to China, India, sell off the rest, just like normal. Somebody here? All right, yeah, I gotta split. I'll see you at the office. What's that? No, a truck. Truck broke by. Thank you. Hi. My... Hi. My name is Fatty Melvin, and I'm a motivational speaker. So who wants to be motivated? Yeah? Okay. Right. Uh, can I get a volunteer? Yeah. Now, you see, in life, you have to push through the competition. You have to push through those obstacles. If you want to be the best, if you want to be at the top, you can't let anything get in your way, all right? So what I want you to do... What's your name? - Nick. - Nick. What I want you to do, Nick, I just want you to break through this board. I believe you. I believe you can do this. If you believe it, you can achieve it, all right? Here we go. All right, here we go. Ooh, ooh, ooh! My god, are you okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ow. Oh, boy. Oh, um... Yeah. Well, this is my story, huh? It's not a great story. I'm kind of sick of it. Don't you get sick of the same story in life? The same story played over and over again like some bad rerun. I know I'm sick of it. You know, there's the "always" story. I always miss out on that job, and I always get sick, and I'm, I'm always failing at every single thing I do. And then there's the "never" story. I'm never gonna succeed in life. I'm never gonna travel. I'm never gonna make it. I'm never gonna achieve my dreams. It's never gonna happen for me. The worst one is the "not enough" story. I'm not enough. I don't look good enough. I'm not slim enough. I don't have enough hair. And clearly I'm not a good enough motivational speaker, as you can all, as you can all see. But what... What if you could change your story? What if you could rewrite it, change it, change the direction? You could just recreate your life, almost. So what would you want your story to be? If you could rewrite it, what would you want it to be? I mean, anyone? I'd go to Paris and eat every single type of cheese. Do it. I'd go base jumping. Yes, do it. I'd go and start a band. Yes. I'd ask Sarah from accounts out. Yes, yes. I'd go visit my dad in Canada. Yes, do it. I'd give away all my money to the homeless. Yes. We can change our story. We can do this thing. And guess what? Guess what? We can all change our story today. You know why? Why? You know why? Why? Personal Best is closing down, and there's nothing to stop you so you can change your story right now. - Wait. - Did you know? - I didn't know that. - What? Absolutely, so good to see you. Yeah, right back. There you are. James Melvin, what did you just say to my staff? Coffee? Coffee. Uh, tea? Let me... Let me explain. And you can't just go around telling my staff confidential information, which isn't even true, mind you. But I overheard. No, Frank explained to me that he was referring to another business venture of ours, not Personal Best. Did you hear him say Personal Best? - No. No, I didn't. - Okay. Cupcake? Oh, at least let me buy you a cupcake. No, thank you. Oh, uh... Look, life can be really tough, okay? But it's actually about a lot of hard work, not just a lot of talk, okay? Life is not just some great story that you can just change whenever you want to. Why not? I mean, are you happy? Are you serious? Well... Am I happy? I just sold my business to a multi-billion dollar conglomeration, okay. I'm gonna be a millionaire. Well, it still doesn't quite answer my question. What do you want from me? Am I happy? No, I'm not happy. I just sold my business. I was losing so much money, and I just feel stuck. That's why I had to do that. I didn't have another choice, okay? But I just have to keep moving forward. And then one day I'm gonna know what I am meant to do, all right? But until then, I just, I'm gonna keep moving forward, okay? But what if there isn't one day? What if all we have is today? I mean, surely there must be something deep down inside that you've always wanted to do. What is it that you wanna do today? Not one day, but today. What, you just get that from a Hallmark card or something? I'm gonna use this one day. Look, I gotta go. Not one day, but right now. Dinner. Are you serious? I know that, to most people, um, having fancy clothes and being physically fit and having a great job and nice car, full head of hair, a family that loves them, I know a lot of these things mean a lot to a lot of people, but if you give me a chance, I'll show you that those things mean very little. I have a boyfriend. Oh. Just as friends. Right, just friends. So how are we looking? I hear the Personal Best deal went through smoothly? - 1-wood. - Yeah. You still on track? Just have to push it through city council, but I'm sure we'll have no problem convincing the town that this is the best deal for everybody. Well, I hope you make this work, Frank. I'd hate to have to find a replacement. 7. Who's ready to lose? Ah, there he is. Frank, have you met Derek? Yeah. Yeah, Derek is my, uh, superstar realtor. Yes, I am. He's gonna be the next Grant Cardone. Ooh. Hey, have you picked out your new private jet? I have. Gulfstream 450 for me. Ah, I remember my first G4. I have three now. Thanks, Derek, for encouraging Lisa to fall through on this deal. I got your back. I won't forget it. Wow, look at that. Thank you. Impressive. Hey, no, just... She's not gonna turn up. She won't show. Oh, she's gonna turn up. What am I gonna say? I don't know what to say to a woman. Um, I don't have any witty remarks or social media commentary or political statements. I don't know what to say. I know. I'll take some notes. I'll write down some notes. That's what I'll do. I just need to write down some notes. That's it. Okay, okay. Um... You just gotta go. Don't think so much. Don't overanalyze it. Perfection is an excuse. Just gotta go. As you are. No ducks in a row, no stars in a line. Just go. Go. Go. I just gotta go. I just gotta go. Hi. Hey. Wow. This is too much. We're friends, right? Oh, look, we already made it to friends. Because I have a boyfriend. Yeah. And, I mean, I was under the impression this was just sort of an acquaintance type dinner. Yeah, yeah, it is. That's all it is. Okay. Yeah. What is this place? Oh, this is, uh, Mayor Bob's golf course. We could have just gone to your house. Oh, uh, this is, uh, much nicer. Take a seat. Thank you. Are you writing a book? Uh, yeah. "The Fatty Melvin Way." Yeah, it's kinda like my nickname. It's a really bad nickname. Oh, I'm kind of used to it. - Okay. - Um... That smells amazing. Yeah, do you like ribs? I've never had ribs before. Really? No. You're gonna love these. Oh my gosh. It's a recipe that my dad and my brother and I all kind of use. Okay. Great. Excuse me, my hands. There you go. Oh my gosh. Been cooking these all day. Okay, you just- - Yeah, you just pick 'em up and eat 'em. Oh my god. Yeah, that's it. This is so good. This is really good. Thank you. Oh my god, dig in. Mm, I'm super hungry, I missed lunch. Mm. Mm. I think I just hurt myself. I'm in pain, I think my tooth. Am I okay? Yeah, yeah. Really? Yeah, you look great. I have, like, a shooting pain. You got a bit of something, uh... Sorry, just a... Yeah. Are you sure? Yeah, yeah, you're fine, you're fine. I'm gonna check my mirror. I'm feeling-Whoa. Hey, let's go for a walk. Let me show you around Mayor Bob's golf course. It's awesome. - Okay. - Yeah. This way. Well, this used to be John Denver's golf course. Oh, the singer? No, John Denver, real estate. My dad and I used to sing, uh, "Annie's Song" together, growing up. Yeah. I used to play Daddy Warbucks in the school play. Oh, okay. Yeah, it was weird. Like I used to have to audition, and after a while, I used to just get the role every year. I don't know why. It's weird. It's not that weird. Oh. Are those yours? Well, yeah, look, you know, um... All right, let me see what you got. Oh, really? Okay. Oh, please. I'll try. Okay, um, er... All right, this. Okay. I been practicing a lot. Okay. I'm pretty good. I can't wait to see that. Yeah. So, uh, you know, it's all in the hips and wrists, I think. Yep. Yeah. Oh. I'd call that a practice shot. Yeah, sure, sure. All right. So. Ooh. All right, it's time to hand it over. Okay. Move aside, sir. So you know what to do? Yes, I do. 'Cause you just gonna, like... It's like, keep your eye on the ball and then swing around like a circle. Like that. Okay. So I gotta play golf. Yeah. All right. And it's about getting it in the hole. Okay. Oh. Very good. All right, come here. Let me show you something. Really? - Yeah. - Oh, okay. Okay. All right. Okay. Relax your body. Yeah. Okay, squat your legs, just a little bit. Just a bit. Don't be weird about it. No, I'm not, I'm- - Just like, relax your body. All right. Okay, all right. You okay? - Yeah. - Okay. And then... And go for it. That was awesome. Let's go work it. Yeah, all right. Uh... Oh, ooh, there it is. All right. I got it. Look who it is. Hannah. Josh. Fatty. Zach. Melvin. We should just go inside. You do everything your girlfriend tells you to do? You'd have to be drunk to be with her. Or fat. You just go inside. I'll take care of this. No, I can help you. No, no, it's okay. You go inside. They're just kids. I'll be fine. Are you sure? Yeah. This ends now. Hey, do you think we should help him? No, he needs to prove his manhood. Okay? Oh my gosh. Hey, get outta here! Hey. Hey. Hey, are you okay? Thank gosh. Did I win? No. Did I protect you? Not one bit, no. Did you have a good night? You okay? Yeah. Thanks. Hold on. Hey. I waited for you for two hours at the Vine. No, I'm with nobody you know. Fine. I gotta go. Oh, um, take some cupcakes. My book. Thanks. I had sort of a good time tonight, so thank you. My tooth is missing, right? Yes. Cool. Hey. Hey. Ooh, what happened to you? It was a really long night. Are you missing a tooth? Can I have some coffee? What's the matter? You want me to call you a dentist? No, I don't want you to call me a dentist. I'm freaking out. I'm freaking out. I feel like I just signed my baby away. Octocircle are a great company. I don't care. I keep feeling like I made the decision. But you're gonna do so well from this. I don't care how well I do, Derek. I care about my staff. Hey, check this out. What do you think? Oh my God. Yeah. Like Grant Cardone does. You make all this money in real estate, then you make even more money selling books about how you made all the money. We're going straight to the top of the mountain, babe. Super power couple, me and you. That's awesome. I'm really, really just- - Let me get you a robe. Oh my god, are you being neurotic about dirt again? You have a problem. Yeah, you're right. But it's so nice out. Okay, are you seriously blocking me right now? We could go for a walk. I'll get you a robe. You're serious. Okay, you know what? Get yourself a robe. I'm leaving. Hey, I made reservations for us at the Vine tomorrow night. But maybe get your tooth fixed first. Everything is the process. It's the journey from where we've been, to where we want to go. Trouble of this chaotic life, that once you see the light, you have to step out and say goodbye. You have to let go to make room for the new. It's time to face those fears and rewrite your story. Not one day, not tomorrow, but today. If you can grow through these hard times, weather the storm, the process will have been worth it. I can't believe Lisa sold the company to that conglomerate. You know, I heard from my cousin over Boone, they came in and bought up a whole lot of businesses and shut them all down. Why? So they can open up a mega mall an hour away. A mega mall. What is it? What is it, Robert? Uh... Have you heard something? I may have overheard that Personal Best was going to be outsourcing and possibly closing down. But Lisa said that was a different company, so, uh, I may have got the wrong information. Lisa. Lisa. I am grateful for all of Lisa's campaign support, okay? And everything else she's done for this town. But don't you see this deal won't affect her? Oh, sure, she'll be fine in some big mansion in the city. But the rest of us. It's a ripple effect. A ripple effect. That can turn us into a rust belt. A rust belt. That company was the only thing keeping this town alive, Robert. It was our lifeblood. It was our neighborhood's biggest employer. Without it, they'll all move away. All move away. And there won't be a town they need a mayor for. No mayor. I should call her. What is that? It works. Hello, Lisa's phone. Yeah, hi, is, uh, Lisa there? Lisa? No, she's not here right now. Could I take a message for her? Yeah, I just need to talk to her about the Octocircle Mall that's gonna be built. Oh. Wow. I think it could be detrimental to the city and to the town- Really? Oh, she'll definitely wanna know that. People are gonna lose jobs- - And I'll be sure to tell her. Oh, great. I really appreciate it. Bye. Deleted. Moron. Hey. Oh, you left your phone. Anybody call? Nope. Okay. Hey, the fish looks good. Ugh. For you. I've think I'm gonna have the burger, since it's our cheat day. Yeah. Protein style, of course. Gotta keep Des and Troy fed. Nope. Oh, yeah. Please. She sold us out. She sold us out. She's gonna call back. We need to take matters into our own hands. We need to take matters into our own hands. What? What? Fatty should go? You. You should go. Go where? To Octocircle. To Octocircle. That's a perfect idea. You should go to Octocircle and you go down and you tell those fat cats, "This town is not for sale." Why me? You can do it. You. You can do it. You're the Fatty. Fatty, Fatty, Fatty, Fatty, Fatty. No. She's gonna call back. Fatty, sometimes the phone doesn't ring. But we're called anyway. You gotta answer the call, Fatty. Fatty, Fatty, Fatty, Fatty, Fatty, Fatty. How was your day? It was busy. Just been really busy with all the stuff that I have to do to close the business, and I thought it was gonna be really simple, but it's not. And I may have to start laying people off and I really don't wanna do that. I really don't. I probably should have got protein style, but, hey, I can afford the calories. Okay. The business stuff, it's nothing personal. Hey, besides, I may have scored a massive real estate deal with these guys. Really? Yeah, it's for this huge piece of land. What's it for? No, you don't. I signed an ND, and my lips are sealed. But if you can keep a secret, it's for one of those massive mega malls. It's gonna be huge. It's gonna be suit heaven for me. For me. Oh, don't ever move your body like that. Hey, did you know about the mall? Ha! The what? The mall that Octocircle is planning on building. Uh, no. What's that got to do with the deal? How do people get to the mall? Look, Octocircle's plan to build the mall is right here, and the exit ramp for the 450 highway is here, and we are right here. It goes through the town. Oh. What are we gonna do about it? Nothing. There has to be some way that we can stop this. Oh. Lisa, you can't do anything. I'm just a small town lawyer. I may have trained with a guy who trained with Jackie Chan, and these hands might have been registered lethal weapons since I was the age of three. I might be able to teach a baby how to do an entire martial arts form in two seconds. What does that have to do with this? This specifically? My point is we signed a contract with one of the biggest companies in America. And that contract is ironclad. Even if we had a case, they would bury us in so much legal paperwork, we'd go on for years. And by that time, they would've probably built the mall by then. They're too big to bring down. They're too big to sue. They're too big to fail. I don't care. There's gotta be something that I can do. You can't do anything. Your hands aren't made of steel. Then what? What do we do? We can pray for a miracle. Hi, um, I would like to have a meeting with the head of Octocircle? Do you have an appointment, sir? Uh, no, no. No, I don't. Well, I can't let you in unless you have an appointment. Oh, uh, can I make an appointment? Certainly, sir. You can call the help desk. Yeah, I've been calling them like a hundred times. Well, apparently we can't help you. You sure? Oh, uh... Uh, okay. Is this your food? It's not mine. I mean, it's just sitting here. All right. Don't want it to go to waste. I can't have gluten. I beat Jordan Spieth by two strokes wearing this. That's cool. Wait, wait, wait! I am so sorry, Mr. Peters, he just slipped right by me. No, no, I- - You know, security is on its way. I represent the workers of Personal Best. Carol, Carol, it's fine. We'll take it from here. Okay. And get my clubs ready. I have a tee time in 20. Seriously, who hired her? And you are? My name is Fatty Melvin and I am a motivational speaker. Really? What, like Tony Robbins? Not quite. I mean, I'm still working my way up. Would you like a donut? No, no, I'm fine, thanks. Maybe two donuts? Half a dozen? No, I'm fine, I'm fine. Carol, bring our hungry guest some donuts. It's just that I wanted to talk to you about the fact that you're closing down the factory and the fact that you're gonna be laying off all these workers and- - I don't understand, Mr. Melvin. It is staying in the town. What wild conspiracies have you been looking up on the internet? I, uh, I don't actually have the internet web. Mm. Get him a couple of donuts, er, or five. I don't want any. Um... It's just that, um, I heard you. What did you say? In the Personal Best restrooms, I overheard you say. Whoa, this guy, following me into the men's room. That's something. This dude walks into our offices and says out loud he's been listening to me in a men's room. Wow. - No, no, no, it's not- - Can you believe that? Let me tell you something, you low life piece of trash. You are in a room full of lawyers right now. I would be very cautious about throwing around wild accusations. Understand? Well, okay then. I don't know what it is you think you heard, Mr. Melvin, but you have now successfully made me late for my golf game. Carol, do I like to be late for my golf game? No, sir. Don't validate his parking. Carol, my clubs. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You promised you wouldn't do this. You, well, you, you, you promised Lisa that you wouldn't sell off the company, that you would keep all the people working there. I mean, you're just lying to her. You're lying to the whole town. Stay here. What you need to understand, Fatty, is the economy works on the basis of supply and demand. So what I'm saying, Fatty, is advertisement creates the demand, the need, the want for something more. And if you can convince people they need something they didn't even know they wanted, well, that's just gravy on top. At Octocircle, we create more, we give people stuff. And everybody wants more stuff. And, hey, if you can create it cheaper somewhere else overseas, well, that's even better. We all get more, and we all get happy. So you're saying we should all be working multiple jobs just so we can buy more stuff? That's what's gonna make us happy? Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Watch out. Fatty, you're probably one of those guys that think that stupid t-shirt slogan, like "Money can't buy you happiness," is actually true, right? Well, Fatty, I'm pretty happy. Hey, man, we're sorry about this. We heard what you said in there. Yeah, we did, you know. I didn't really say anything. Can't believe that my dad got laid off after 30 years on a job. You believe that? Oh, that's scary. So we know what it's like. Yeah, we do. And, well, that's why it makes it hard for us to do this. Oh, well, gotta go. Whoa. They don't want you here, man. Yeah, but we respect you for trying. Thanks for the cookies. Hi. I sent you a bunch of texts. I was trying to get a hold of you. Oh, uh... Is that your phone? Yeah, it's a vintage. That explains it. You wanna sit? Oh, thanks. This is my grandma. She was so pretty. We used to make cupcakes together and we'd pass them around to all the neighbors. It wasn't about money or anything like that. It was just, like if people were sick or they had lost their jobs or just had a baby. It's just the best feeling in the world to see people's faces. And then my grandma died and I had to move to a new school, and all the kids there just started calling me fat. And it was just really bad. And my dad left us, and he left us like in this really bad financial state and my super skinny mom was trying to find a new husband and so she put me on every diet there was because she said she couldn't have a chubby daughter. And I just remember feeling determined to solve my family's financial difficulties. And so I lost the weight and I started making money and I built this company from the ground up. That's how all this started. And I remember just, like telling myself, as I was working so hard, like, eventually one day I would be happy. And, like, no matter how much I eat, I'm just hungry. Now I have more money than I could ever think about having, and the only thing that I feel inside is empty. You know, whenever you get those, like, really bad knots in your stomach and you keep telling yourself, I just keep pushing forward and just pushing it down and pushing it down, then it's eventually gonna go away. But then it doesn't. I had to lay people off today. My favorite thing about my job was giving other people jobs. That's all I wanted to do. And today I had to call those same people and take their jobs away. I did that. I even have to lay our janitor off. By the way, do you know who Robert Melvin is? 'Cause I was talking to my payroll today and she said that the motivational speaker that came in was Robert Melvin, and I know the janitor has the same last name. I'm just really confused. I'm Robert Melvin. My brother is James Melvin. What? Yeah. I'm your janitor. I've been your janitor for five years. I've been... I've been watching you for five years and just love- - You're not a motivational speaker? No, no, no, I, I- - You said all those things? Why would you do that? Well, I... I liked you. You like me? I freely liked you. What are you doing here? Mayor Bob told me you were here. I wanted to invite you to step up and join me, live in the "Mountain Top Life." I've seen a lot of deals go down, and you are not gonna get a better deal than this. Uh, look, I'm not really interested in any deal. I've been thinking about me and you a lot lately. I don't even know who you are. Who are you? Nobody wants you here. Here. This is embarrassing. I don't care. I want the world to know. Don't ever spin like that again. Lisa Cohen. Are you serious? About as serious as I am of any of my real estate deals. Our true self, the person God created you to be, has been buried under so much rubble in this chaotic life, that once you see the light, you have to step out and say goodbye. You have to let go to make room for the new. It's time to face those fears and rewrite your story. Not one day, not tomorrow, but today. You're not here, James. You don't know what this is like. Son of a... Oh, spasm. Here, here, here. I'm fine, I'm fine. Okay. Listen, we have a problem. I feel it. No. There's been a leak. No, not that. They know about the mall. They know about the off-ramp. How did this happen? I don't know. Well, I need you to find someone to fix this quickly. Do you think you can find someone? Or am I gonna have to take matters into my own hands? I, uh, I have somebody in mind. Okay, okay, okay. Breathe through it. Okay. I'll guide you. Lower. Lower. Yeah. Hey, hey. Lisa? I was on my way to see a client and thought I'd come by and see how you were doing. I wanna fight them. I know, I know, I know. But you can't. Legally speaking, you signed a conflict of interest agreement. There's gotta be something that we can do. Well, the council meeting, perhaps. Okay. The only way would be if you were to get the whole town to say no. But that's nearly impossible, given the timeframe. Nothing is impossible. And, you know, nobody in this town even wants them here. No one in town is in town. They're looking for new jobs. It might be time to give up, Lisa. Is that new? Oh, uh, yeah. Look, they have a great dental and health plan. They're not all that bad. Look, I got kids. Yeah. A lot of people have kids. Hey, hey, Fatso Melvin. - Fatty. - Fatty. Fatty Melvin, the next Tony Robbins right here. Fatty, Fatso. Who cares? We're all friends here, right? Um... You, me, Janet, and 10 lawyers. Would you mind if we, um... Come in? Oh, okay. Okay, ha-ha, here we are. Alrighty. You look like a sporty guy, huh? Let me ask you a question. How often would you say you exercise? Well, about three times. A week? A month? No, I've given you my answer. Great. Let's get him the clubs. Uh, yeah, I, I, I don't really need these. Yeah, kill the clubs. Yeah, you're probably not a golfing man, but you seem more like a, uh... Football. Football guy. That's right, yeah, football. You play some football? A little bit in high school. Yeah? I can tell. Well, yeah, uh, like the coach really wanted me on the team, but, uh, he kind of put me on the side and so- Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's real interesting. Let's get right to it, Fatso. - Fatty. - Fatty. You... You care about this town, don't you? Yes, I, I, I do. Yes, I respect that. I can tell. You have this special quality, and people want to listen to you when you speak. In fact, Fatso- - Fatty. - Fatty, when you, uh, you came to the office the other day, your words spoke to me. Now, a lot of people think that Octocircle is this faceless corporate Goliath that wants to come in and crush everything in its path. That is not true. In fact, that couldn't be further from the truth because we care. We care about... - Education. - Education. We care deeply about... - Environment. - Environment. And also... - The troops. - The troops. We care about the crap that little Americans like you think about on a daily basis. Let me ask you a question. How do you spell jobs? Uh, J- - Opportunity, that's right. Opportunity. You have the capacity within you to create thousands of jobs. I mean, the mall itself will create 10 times more employment opportunities than Personal Best and the entire town currently has. And listen, Fatso- - Fatty. Fatty, it's not just any kind of jobs, this is high-paying jobs with benefits. And we know that that is important to you and it's important to us. If it's important to this town and it's important to you, it's important to Octocircle. Who's with me, Janet? Yep. Absolutely. So I am here. I am here, Fatso- - Fatty. - Fatty. To ask for your help. From one patriot to another, we need your backing on this. I, uh... So how about it, Fatty? Can you help motivate this town to make the best choice, the right choice, the only choice? I want you to take a look outside. As a small token of our appreciation of your support of this town, we would like nothing more than to see you in that bad boy right there. Suits you to a tee. Hi. Oh, hi. I've read your book. Hm. It's really good, Robert. Pretty good for a janitor, huh? It's good for anybody. Are you thinking about working for Octocircle? I'm really sorry. I know I got us into this mess, and it was a really big mistake selling Personal Best. It doesn't have to be like this. Look, they're not that bad. I mean, they're creating thousands of jobs for this town, so, you know. Aren't you about following your true calling in life? Isn't that what you always say? You know, "Not one day, but today"? You know, if you end up working for Octocircle, you're gonna be stuck with no choice under a corporation that doesn't even care about you. Well, that's what it was like for me at Personal Best. At least these guys, they have medical and dental and a 401k. And they give me the opportunities to climb that corporate ladder to one day maybe even manage my own Octocircle franchise. Seriously. You don't buy into all that junk. You know it's a lie. It's a cold, dark, scary world out there. Isn't that what you told me? I don't have all these great opportunities. I've gotta do what I can. And this is a great opportunity for me. This is a really good book, and you are very talented. And you could help a lot of people. This is not how it's supposed to end. We can change the story. We can. That's what you always said. What, you talking about the city council meeting? Yes, listen, if we get enough no votes, they will have to stop the plan for the Octocircle Mall proposal. Well, why don't you go? Legally I can't go. Okay. I'm also getting married the same day. Congratulations. But you can. You can go and convince them to vote no. Yeah. I am gonna go. Really? I'm gonna vote yes. You should finish your book. I have one more question for you. Are you really happy with your story now? Dad? New motor home. Yeah, it's like 33 feet or something. It's got satellite TV and internet web and leather seats and stuff. It's pretty cool. I still prefer the old classic. What are you doing here? I quit drinking. Oh, that's great. It's been two weeks. Congratulations. Robert, I know I haven't always been there for you. I got so caught up in trying to make it work out, that I missed it. Life goes by so fast. And before you know it, you wake up one day and you realize you never lived it. Your brother understood that. He was never truly happy, again, after Heather left him. The night your brother died, I saw him alone in his brand new car, before you arrived. I saw him sitting there and he was the saddest I've ever seen him. I remember getting angry at him, thinking to my myself, "Why is he so sad? He's got everything." I just couldn't understand it. You didn't know how he felt, I mean... I pushed him to get where he was, and he was miserable. I'm sorry. I am so sorry. It's okay, Dad. It's okay. Robert, you can fix this. You can do what your brother always wanted to do. Find happiness. What is the greatest thing we can achieve in this life? Maybe you were wondering this yourself. What is it? Is it love? If it's love, why do we fail at it so often? Hey, you're the fat guy from the golf course. You read my book? Uh, no. What's your name again? Uh, Fatty Melvin. And you're a motivational speaker? Uh, yeah. Well, good for you, Fatty Melfy. Frank asked me to speak to you and make sure we're all good for today. You got your speech all worked out? Uh-huh. Can I see it? It's, uh, it's kind of personal. Is that your speech? Nope. Why don't you show me what's in the box? No. Why don't you show me what's in the box? Huh? No, no. Oh, yeah. Three years of MMA training is gonna make you show me what's in the box. That's not good. What happened? Yeah, man, you need to go deal with that. Uh-uh, I dealed with the last one. No, no, no, I did the last one. You remember... I'm getting the hooks in. I'm getting the hooks in. You know what? Paper, Rock, Scissors. All right? Come on. Come on, it's the only fair way. How about you go to sleep so I can go to my wedding. Huh? She doesn't... She doesn't know you work for Octocircle. What's that got to do with you? Huh? Go to sleep. Get this fat loser outta here. I'll do the speech myself. Do you know who I am? Let me through, you neanderthal. Now, we know who Fatty Melvin is. My whole house is Plastic Ware. Welcome. What is the meaning of this? Oh, oh. Well, what is it? Oh, yeah, uh, your majesty. Oh, I mean, your honor. Um, thank you. My name is, uh, Fatty Melvin and, uh, I'm here to put forth the proposition to vote against the Octocircle Mall. Well, you better act fast. We're about to take the vote. Okay. I would like to read a letter from my late brother, James Melvin. Okay. I wish someone had told me that when I climbed this mountain and reached the top that I would be all alone. I wish that I was told that happiness isn't found in more. Instead, I was told that this was the prize, the goal, that I would be complete, here, among the money and stuff. But I found out- Isn't this your friend? - That it's all vanity. - That Fatty guy? Meaningless. I had everything I wanted in front of me, and yet I sacrificed it all in order to get more. I wish I had realized that who I am is enough, and that my friends and family, and even the strangers around me, are worth more than any amount of money, power, or prestige I could ever obtain. I wish someone had told me that the prize wasn't at the top of the mountain after all. That it was here at the bottom all along, in that ordinary normal life that I spent my whole life running from. I wish that someone had told me to choose joy in the now instead of searching for it in the what may be. I wish someone had told me. They didn't. But now I'm telling you. It's time to listen. That's a beautiful speech, son. Just beautiful. A little long, but can we just get going now? What is it that you want? Do you want more stuff, more toys? He who has the most toys wins. But you can't take it with you. But I can leave it to my kids, right? You know, the... The only thing I ever wanted from my dad was his love. I just wanted him to love me, that's it. That was it. I didn't need anything else. I just have one last thing. One last thing. All right, I think it's time for us to have a vote. Okay, um, I guess it's over to you now. I think it's time for us to take a vote on the matter. All those in favor of Octocircle's mall proposal say aye. Aye. Those opposed? Nay. Hm. You've got some moxie, son Nay. The motion for Octocircle's proposal is denied. Your brother would be very proud of you. Thanks, Dad. Thank you, Robert. Yes, Fatty did it. You. That's for making me lose my security deposit on the wedding reception. Huh. What? She's gone. New York, apparently. On the flip side, I have a sweet new gig at Octocircle. Uh. What do you say? It's not all bad, Fatty. Nah, come on. Now get off my property. Hey, Fatty. Hi, Kathy. How's life? Never been better. How are you doing? The same. Our true self, the person God created you to be, has been buried under so much rubble of this chaotic life, that once you see the light, you have to step out and say goodbye. You have to let go to make room for the new. It's time to face those fears and rewrite your story. Not one day, not tomorrow, but today. Robert, if you're ever over this way, I could always do some "motorvation." Love, Lisa. My brother, James, used to say, "If you could dream it, you can achieve it." That's, uh, pretty good advice. The problem is, having your own dreams is scary sometimes. You might fall, you might fail, and honestly, you might never achieve them. But the truth is we all fall, and fail. But if we never give our dreams a chance, we will never know the joy of reaching. So dream big, then go boldly, venture into the unknown, honor the past that helped make you who you are, take joy in the present, remember that you make a difference here on earth just by being you, and then get out there and tackle the future. Know that you're not alone. You're awesome. You got this. This is your story. Get out there and write it. Go write your own story.
