ACT 1 GLORIA - That one. - No... no. He's good-looking. No. - "Attentive." - Attentive? Know what that means? - That he'll do whatever you want. - Yeah. - Kind of a wimp. - "Divorced and courageous." - Just look at his face! - "Almost 6-foot-6." No. Imagine that in bed! You'd better hold on! Look, he's the one. "Michel would love to take you out to lunch." He's handsome. - I don't feel ready. - If you don't go, I will. Can I see? You'd go out with a guy so easily? It's just lunch. We're not getting married. Look. Isn't he handsome? Mummy's new boyfriend. Just for one lunch! - Yeah. - Tell her. Go on, Mummy! Go on, Gloria! You've got nothing to lose. And everything to gain. - I'm saying yes. - No. I'm saying yes. Monique, hit "yes". - No. - It's done. Don't give me that look. One date, that's all. I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. I'm really pleased to make your acquaintance, Gloria. You're even prettier than your picture. Crazy! Prettier than a picture. I invoke the presence of the elementals to join in this ritual so I may benefit from their influence and realise my desire. Let Gloria succumb to my charms. Let it be. My head! I'm pleased to make your acquaintance, Gloria. You're even prettier than your picture. Come. Thank you. We'd like a 2006 Bardolino, please. - I hope you like Italian wines. - Yes. Good. Are you from the area? Not really. You're mysterious. I like women who have secrets. I find that noble. You're a little like a letter from a far-off land. You wonder what's inside, can't wait to open it. Your heart beats, your hands tremble. Are you the letter I've awaited for so long, Gloria? So you work in a hospital? You save lives. That's a real calling. No. I work in the morgue. I lay out dead bodies. And you? I'm in business. You might say I'm a public servant. I'm in the shoe business. Most people don't take shoes seriously. But they should. Because shoes mean comfort. A bad pair will ruin your feet, your back. They pinch your nerves, give you headaches. They give you toothaches. And look at the importance of shoes in mythology. Little Thumb's seven-league boots, Cinderella's glass slipper... I'll stop there because... You can tell so much about someone just by his footwear. Show me your shoes, I'll tell you who you are. Look at the man in the brown suit over there. Discretely. Elegant, refined. He's undoubtedly English. Now look behind me. At the guy... with the girl in red. He acts like a big shot. But he looks like shit. He's probably French. And right behind me. See the guy with those clodhoppers? Heavy, shapeless, poorly designed. I'd wager he's German. See what I mean about shoes and public service? I help people do something essential, find the shoe made for their foot. I'll take care of that. Thank you. To passion. And good things. To passion and good things. A T-bar sandal would be perfect. With a thin strap. Very thin. I think you need a firm fastening, Gloria. Very firm. Look at me. My daughter's asleep. - Your daughter? - Yes. Really? - Don't you like kids? - Sure, I like kids. - Gently. - Yes, gently. - Gently. - Very gently. - Got any jam? - Yes. - That's how you dress for work? - Yes. Pretty sexy! Your mum's trying to wake the dead! What a beautiful sight! Let's not waste it. You really are pretty sexy. How about five minutes in the bedroom? Hello? Already? I can be there in 10 minutes. Will that work? Ok. You're welcome. That was the hospital. I'll just be an hour. Can I leave Monique with you? Be nice to Michel, honey. Did you eat your toast? Take off. Leaving already? Excuse me. Yes, speaking. Yes, I know. I'll take care of it. No problem. Exactly. Goodbye. - You're leaving? - I have to go. Nothing serious, I hope. One of my suppliers is threatening to stop shipment if I don't pay him. I have to find some money fast. Very fast. I can lend you a little money. Want a check? A check won't work because I'm overdrawn. Wait here. If you don't help the people you love, you don't really love them. When will I see you again? Soon. 0650-89-87-10. Mummy? Mummy! - Do you know this man? - No. And you? No. - And you? - No. Do you know this man? No? - Do you know this man? - No. No. And you? Let me explain... Oh, my head! Michel! Michel... How did that happen? What? The scar on your head. A beam on a construction site. I was 16. That's why I have migraines. My mother lived in a small apartment. When a man came, I had to sleep in the bedroom closet. When Mum didn't have a man, she took me into her bed. I had to take their place. Until one guy threw me out. Then I wandered around. Not long. Just long enough to realise I had a gift. The skill Mum taught me, giving pleasure. Except, as you see, now I take something in return. And you? I was married to a man... That's all in the past. I don't really have a shoe store. - I seduce women... - I know. You should go home, Gloria. I wanna stay with you. You keep doing what you do. And I'll help you. Being with you, living for you... relieving your migraines... Be mine, Michel. Want to? Yes. Yes. You're the most beautiful thing in my life. No one is prettier than this little girl. No one in the whole, wide world. Can you take care of Monique? I need you to take care of her. You look strange. I've never felt so good in my life. Monique, I'm going to do something. It's important. I love you. Thank you, Madeleine. ACT 2 MARGUERITE My sister's not well. Her husband just left her. Could she stay with us a while? Of course. - Family is sacred, my love. - Thank you, Marguerite. How are you, Gloria? Did you have a nice day? There's champagne left. Help yourself. Then I'll show you to your room. Here it is. It's small but functional. And the bathroom is right next-door. Make yourself at home. But don't forget it's my house. No, I'm just kidding. It's humour, Gloria. - Do you like humour? - Humour? - Do you? - Yes. Ah, I'm not surprised. With a brother like yours, it must be in the blood. Humour's genetic, you know. My uncle was so funny! I get it from him. I love to laugh. Laughter is life. So is love. I'll leave you. The towels are in the bathroom. Thank you. - Good night, Gloria. - Good night, Michel. They left me all alone in here. What was that? What's going on? What's the matter? Don't leave me alone. Stop! I have to get back. Stop this nonsense! - Stay with me! - That's impossible. Michel! Is everything Ok? Fine. Just a nightmare. Be right there! Fuck me! I can't! Not now! Stop! Stop! Marguerite, I've been thinking. That workshop next door would make a great shop. I don't have the initial investment. Maybe you could help me. You're so beautiful. We obviously won't have children together. But a shop... A shop is something we could build together. It could be a sort of substitution for a child. We could watch it grow. Grow... Look at me... look at me. How much do you need? Michel! I need you. Sorry to interrupt you. You have a wonderful brother. That's true. What luck! Did your husband get along with Michel? I ask because when I see how close you are, intimate almost, I think, sometimes a husband might get jealous. You have a slight accent, don't you? Spanish. But Michel doesn't. - Was it your father? Mother? - Mother. Ok. And what did your husband do? My husband was a bastard. The only one I can count on is Michel. Ah, I understand. You know, Gloria, all men aren't bastards. My first husband was very sweet. Except he never saw me. He didn't see me, but... he wasn't mean. But when Michel looks at me... Sometimes he caresses my hair and looks at me. That... I've never felt like this before. Can I tell you something? Being in love is magnificent. I'll go to the cellar for some wine. - Get a good one. - Of course. - The best. - The best. For Michel, always the best. We'll have a ball. I could thank your husband for throwing you out! What did you do? Do you realise what you just did? She was gonna give us money within days. No, no. Didn't you know that? - I told you, you agreed. - She wanted you. Obviously, we were married. I'm working. I have to fuck them! - Gloria, do you hear me? - Forgive me! Forgive me! Forgive me, Michel. - Say you forgive me. - Shit. Say you forgive me. Say you forgive me. You're incredible. You're really incredible. You are. Do you realise what you've done? Gloria! Go on, I'll take care of it. Michel... Be careful. There are people with bad intentions out there, incapable of understanding us. They can't see the immensity of our love. They no longer have dreams. They're empty and alone. They live in darkness. I found you. But they didn't. Be careful, my love Be careful out there People are incapable Of seeing the immensity Of our infinite love They no longer have dreams They're empty and alone They live in darkness lfound you You brought me back to life S0 beware My love Be careful My love, be careful Look! "The African Queen". With my favourite actor, Bogart. - Wanna see it? - Yes. - Did you see it? - What? The pain in Bogarfs eyes? No. Exactly, you see nothing. Yet he was consumed by the crab. - The crab? - Cancer of the oesophagus. He never complained. Never a word about the mosquitos, the heat, nothing. Absolute respect for Humphrey. I invoke the presence of the elementals to join in this ritual, so I may benefit from their influence and realise my desire. Let Gabriella succumb to my charms. Let it be. - Are you a sorcerer? - A little bit. What are you going to do to that woman? Whatever it takes to get her money. Will you sleep with her? No, from now on I'll only sleep with you. Do you love me? - It that true? - Yes. ACT 3 GABRIELLA As I said in my letter, a few years ago Gloria created a mission in a small village in the southern Congo. As she needed help, I eventually joined her. The mission was attacked by rebels. The village destroyed, men slaughtered, all the women raped. Our servant was hacked to pieces before our eyes. Without warning, like a piece of wood. No, thank you. After the massacre, we repatriated and founded Aid Africa, a Catholic non-profit organisation to raise funds for Father Samuel, who's refused to leave the village. He's battled injustice and barbarism. He's taken in the women and children, victims of a civil war that never ends. Mercy! All that misfortune is fascinating. My God, dear girl, are you crying? You're an example to us all. I'm proud to welcome you into my home. Welcome to our community, from the bottom of my heart. I imagine I'll see you at Mass on Sunday. In 20 years, I've only missed Mass once. I'll take my leave. Thank you so much. Courage. May the Lord be with you. Gabriella, I imagine you've thought of our envelope. Next week. That's the fifth time now. You're very down to earth for a man of God. We may have our poor, but I'm not a cash machine. If he wants envelopes, he should go to the post office. Jesus told the 12 apostles, "On your journey, heal the sick, "revive the dead, "purify the lepers, "chase demons." Jesus said, "You have received freely. "Now give freely." Michel... - Michel! - What? Let's go. Let's leave this house. - No. - Come live with me. Why not? Why not? What do you like so much here? What do you like here? You wanna seduce her? Seducing them excites you! - That's what excites you! - Calm down. - Fucking them! - Calm down! Calm down! Stop pissing me off! Calm down. Calm down, Gloria. I shouldn't have yelled at you. Forgive me. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done it. I apologise. I'll never do it again. I swear, Ok? - Remember this? - No! Remember? No, I don't remember! Oh Michel, oh Michel, oh Michel... I just heard from Father Samuel. Things are bad. The rebels came back. They're at the mission gate. If nothing's done, I fear the worst. That they'll start raping again? Raping? Sometimes they'll rape the mothers instead of the girls. But most of the girls are orphans. Oh, my God! Gabriella, it's urgent. Could you intervene personally? With those barbarians? No, financially. I'll ask Father Louis. He'll take up a collection. Let's have lunch. Gloria... - What are you doing? - What does it look like? No, we can't, Michel. What can't we do? Tell me. - Go back to your room. - Keep quiet. No, I don't want to. - Don't want to do what? - I don't want to. - No, I can't. - You can't what? You don't want to? Don't want to what? What is that? You like that. Is that it? You like that. I forbid you to come. No! Stop! Stop! Stop! It hurts. Gloria, it hurts. My head hurts. See what you made me do? Michel, will you take me for your wife? Will you love me, cherish me, honour me and keep me in sickness and in health? Will you forsake all other women and keep yourself only unto me, till death do us part? I Will. Now you. Gloria, will you take me for your husband? - Will you love me? - Will you love me? - Cherish me? - Cherish me? - Honour me? - Honour me? And keep me in sickness and in health? And keep me in sickness and in health? Will you forsake all other men? Will you forsake all other men? And keep yourself only unto me? And keep yourself only unto me? - Till death do us part? - Till death do us part? I Will. Yes, I will. I love you so much! I love you so much, Michel! ACT 4 SOLANGE It's a Jaguar. A 1951, X420 roadster. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have. No, on the contrary. - Will you help me? - Yes. It was Paul's. A boyhood dream. There was nothing left over. Just a Jaguar. I think he loved two things in life, this car and me. I don't know which he preferred. Since he died, it won't start. It's a real jewel. 6 cylinders, 160 horsepower, 5,000 RPMs. Did you know Bogie had one? - Who? - Bogart. "Casablanca", "To Have And Have Not". The actor. Humphrey Bogart. - Oh, Ok. - Mind if I look under the hood? - You mechanically inclined? - A little. With all your tools, I'll do fine. If you can get it started, I'll be thrilled. _ Mummy! _ Yes? - Can you help me with my homework? - I'm coming. - Want me to help you? - Ok... - You don't mind? - On the contrary. I'd love it! So what's your homework? French, history... French! Got a splinter? So now you're a mechanic? I worked in a factory once. Didn't I tell you? I assembled brakes. A car is a car! Solange asked me to look at it. A car is a car and Michel is Michel. - What does that mean? - Nothing. We agreed this time. Seduce her, get married, an accident, insurance money. Is that clear? And if this car runs, all the better for us. Don't take me for an idiot. I see your little game when I'm not here. You see things when you're not here? Think I don't see your little game with the kid? You like her. You're off your rocker! Why didn't you ever play with my daughter? Why? Gloria, calm down. Calm down. Everything's fine. Ok? I miss my daughter. A lot. I know. Look! What's this? Gloria! Gloria... I'm really happy that you're here. Michel and I are very happy to be here, too. You know... I've been alone here for so long. Loneliness is no good. Michel is so nice to Eve. She likes him a lot. Her dad died when she was three months old. - I'm sorry. - You mustn't be. It's not your fault. - You Ok, Gloria? - I'm tired. I'm going to bed. Good night, Solange. Good night. - Gloria! - Yes? I made you some tea. When this place is ours, we'll bring my daughter here. - Want to? - Sure. She loves horses. Good idea. "You write." Y-O-U space W-R-I-T-E. Very good. "You wrote." Y-O-U space W-R-O-T-E. Very good. "Crawfish." C-R-A- W. F-I-S-H. Very good. I have a present for you. I made it for you. Say thank you. Say thank you. It's ugly- It's a gift. You don't say that. Say thank you. It's ugly- What's the matter with you? Pick it up and say thank you. If I say I don't want to, I don't want to! - Stand up! - No! Say thank you to Gloria! When you get a present, you say thank you. I don't want a present from her! I don't want her to exist! I don't want her here! What are you saying? What's the matter with you? I don't like that lady! Are you blind or what? Say thank you. They're our guests! They're your guests, not mine! I won't do anything for her! - Keep quiet! - No, I won't! Keep quiet! Pick it up and say thank you. - I don't want to! - Hurry up! - No! - Go to your room! I'm really sorry, Gloria. It's Ok. Mummy! You don't have much choice. I'll go. - Drink this. - Thank you. Good? It'll work out, you'll see. Gloria... Gloria? I'd like to talk to you. - I'm pregnant. - Pregnant? - By whom? - Michel. That's impossible. Why? You don't sleep together. Michel told me. Really? He must have had good reason to say that. But unless it's the Messiah, it's Michel's baby. I only sleep with your brother. I wanted your advice. I don't want to keep him. Michel? No, the baby. I don't want to keep the baby. You wanna kill Michel's baby? I already have Eve. Have I shocked you? I'm sorry, Gloria. Gloria! Gloria! Did you sleep with Solange? Don't start again! Answer me. - Did you sleep with her? - No! She's pregnant! You got her pregnant! Holy shit. I'm sorry, Gloria. It's not my fault. She's a slut! Stop! Gloria! Stop! It's not my fault! - What are you doing? - Stop! Where's my mummy? Where is she? Where's my mummy? Come here, you little shit! Why don't you like me? Stop! Let her go! Let her go! Gloria, open this door! Eve! Eve! Eve! Open this door! Gloria! Where's my daughter? Where's Eve? Mummy! Let me out! Where's my daughter? Kill her. Kill her! Michel... Michel, no! Kill her! You can fuck her, you can kill her! Go on! - Kill her! - No, Michel! Mummy! Kill her! Michel, I beg you! Michel, no! Kill her! Go on! Michel! Michel! Take off! Run! Take off! Stop! Stop!
