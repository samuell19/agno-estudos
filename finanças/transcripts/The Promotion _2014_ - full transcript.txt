Yesterday I was in the old people's home. At your mother's. She is fine. Recognized me immediately. Actually she always does. Would be nice if you'd visit her too. Lorenz, please talk to me! Shall it go on like this forever? Will you continue to ignore me? Lorenz! How often do you want me to say sorry? Talk, Lorenz... Let us talk. I heard in the radio and read in the paper that your company is in trouble? What's the matter? Why do you stick to the past? What else can I do? Morning! Looks like the end - doesn't it? Morning, Mister Fuchs. Accounts department, Fuchs. Yes, Mister... In the compensation? I cannot imagine that... Yes, one moment please. Listen... I have the file in front of me. Yes... Yes, I see. I have... You are right. Sorry, I made a mistake there... Yes... I'll to correct it... Yes... I am sorry... Good bye... and... All the best. Accounts department, Fuchs... Yes... Yes, sure, I'm coming. And? Going to see the Boss, too? It's tragic, isn't it? Do you have a new job or... early retirement? One could get a sinking feeling. Fucking corporations. Hey... good luck! Fuchs! Come in! Sit down! No chairs anymore... all gone... You for sure wonder why you are still here... You never asked, just went ahead with the termination, compensations... all the shit. I appreciate that. Your coolness, serenity, reliability. Always in the companies interest... And now everything here is finished. Now, Fuchs, come... sit down here. Yes, sit down... Just a second... Hello, Mr. Armand, nice that you call. It's a pleasure... Yes. The merger is dynamite, you are right. Thanks to my hidden budget of the efficiency gains... Yes, we broadened our client basis That's the so called synergy effect. That brings us to a five times larger investment capacity. Sorry? The conservatives are histories interval signal! That is great. Where did you find that one? In this sense: In Hamburg the signs are pointing towards a storm tide!? Mister Armand, wonderful that you called but I am in a meeting... I am looking forward to finally meet you Monday. I'm optimistic... All the best. That is communication, Fuchs. One fish talks to the other fish. The question is who is the predator! Well, we already swallowed a lot of specimen fish all over Europe. We made profit! We swallowed them for ridiculous prices We break them, restructure, discharge, engulf, break, dump, gain profit. Devour, destroy, digest, shit them out. Pretty Darwinistic. But I like it. It turns me on! And you too! We are connected. Cut from the same cloth. I see it in your eyes. Your bleakness, your toughness, your concentration. And your secret. The secret nobody knows. Except me of course. You placed your mother in an ugly old peoples home to get rid of her. Do you still live in her flat? While your wife is fucking men from the street. Ex wife. - Ex wife. Is it still like that? You told me everything three years ago. Remember. During the anniversary party. Totally drunk. That's when they babble... You have to get out of it. Finish what is breaking you. You belong on the top. Out of hatred and disgust you must learn! Transform! That's what I did! Do you know my story? You don't know my story! But I've learnt something. I implemented it. And look where I am now... What do you think? Will I drop you or take you to Hamburg? I will take you to Hamburg. As the boss. As the boss of the human resource department. 1200 staff. Quite a lot. You are able to do that. We'll rumble the company in Hamburg! New machines, new product range, New pressure on old bones till they brake. But at that time we are long gone. You have been promoted. And you call me JÃ¶rg now, Lorenz. And you get away from here. Away from that shit!! All trained animals. They are all rotten. Rotten society. Nobody knows why he still exists. Scaredy pants zombies. But we can crunch others. Because we have the toughness, the hatred the spirit and the nerves. That's why we'll survive. So... Take the day off and celebrate your promotion. Buy a new suit... you do not look so good... Yes... Pardon? My goodness... What does he want? Yes... How could that happen? But he bought the rope himself... Hey - are you through... No, no... What? Yes, yes... May I help? No, thanks. Are they all real...? What do you think. No, we are not in America. That are bobby pistols. A fake gun. You want a real gun? But certainly no permission, right? What do you think? Without a license you do not get a gun from me... Thanks. Goodbye. - Goodbye Sorry... I just saw you in the gun shop. You are looking for the real thing? A real gun? I could maybe organize something. Give me your number. Come on... O177 38858876 Listen. I try to organize something and then I get in touch, okay? OKAY? Call you.
