CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS. MIGUEL! MIGUEL! MIGUEL. MIGUEL. GWANGI... NO, NO! LEAVE IT. HE WHO TAKES FROM GWANGI, THE EVIL ONE, IS CURSED. ONLY BY AN OLD WOMAN'S TONGUE. I TELL YOU, IF HE DOES NOT GO BACK TO THE FORBIDDEN VALLEY, WE SHALL ALL SUFFER A TERRIBLE FATE. MY EYES ARE BLIND, BUT I CAN STILL SEE THE SIGNS! KEEP YOUR SUPERSTITIONS TO YOURSELF, OLD WOMAN. FOOL! ACH! ONE DAY HE WILL LEARN TO OBEY THE LAW OF GWANGI, OR LIKE HIS BROTHER, HE WILL PERISH! HOWDY, MA'AM. BASTA, SEÑORITA. CARRY YOUR CASE, SEÑOR? EH, DON'T BOTHER ME, BOY.

NOW GET LOST, COMPRENDE? ADIOS. THERE IS NO MONEY IN THAT, SEÑOR. ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME? IF THE MONEY IS RIGHT. TELL ME WHERE THE ARENA IS. 2 MILES OUT OF TOWN. 2 MILES? YOU NEED THAT HORSE, SEÑOR, AND A GUIDE. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A REAL HUSTLER, CHICO. I'LL BET PAPPY SENDS YOU OUT HUSTLING WHILE HE STAYS HOME TAKING AN ALL-DAY SIESTA. NO, SEÑOR. MY PAPA IS DEAD.

THE FIRST MILLION IS ALWAYS THE TOUGHEST, LOPE. AAH! AY-III! YAH! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I NOW HAVE THE HONOR TO PRESENT THE LOVELY AND TALENTED STAR OF OUR SHOW, RIDING WONDER HORSE OMAR, MISS T.J. BRECKENRIDGE! WELL, I'LL BE. HEY, TUCK! TUCK KIRBY! HI THERE. NOW, WHAT IN THE NAME OF SAM HILL BRINGS YOU AROUND HERE? UP TO NO GOOD, THAT'S FOR SURE. WELL, YOU DON'T SEEM VERY GLAD TO SEE ME, CHAMP. ABOUT AS GLAD AS A DYING MULE TO SEE A VULTURE. WELL, I'M NO VULTURE... BIRD ON THE WING, MAYBE. YEAH. FLYING TO THE NEXT QUICK BUCK. WELL, LOOKS LIKE YOU FINALLY MADE IT. YEAH, I'M MAKING OUT ALL RIGHT. ALL YOU EVER CARED ABOUT WAS YOURSELF, NO MATTER WHO GETS HURT. WELL, I STILL CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO T.J. YEAH, ALWAYS DID. YOU FUSS AROUND HER LIKE A MOTHER HEN. HER DADDY WAS A FRIEND OF MINE. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO PROTECT HER FROM GUYS LIKE YOU, RUNNING OUT ON HER LIKE YOU DID. YOU WEREN'T SORRY TO SEE ME GO, WERE YOU? NOPE. BUT IT DARN NEAR BROKE T.J.'s HEART. YEAH. YOU KNOW, FROM WHAT I HEAR, YOU'RE NOT DOING SO GOOD BY HER, EITHER. HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH CUSTOMERS TO PAY THE FEED BILL. LISTEN, WE DON'T NEED ANY BIG SHOT WHEELER-DEALER COMING AROUND HERE TELLING US HOW TO RUN THIS SHOW. NOW, WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO BACK WHERE YOU... WAIT A MINUTE. THAT'S HER TUNE. THAT'S THE GRAND FINALE, ISN'T IT? WELL, NOW, I'M SURPRISED YOU REMEMBERED. WELL, EXCUSE ME, I GOTTA SEE THIS... FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE, YOU UNDERSTAND? CARLOS. HURRY UP WITH THAT RAMP. HOWDY THERE, PARTNER. EX-PARTNER. TO WHAT DO WE OWE THIS UNPLEASANT SURPRISE? I'M JUST LOOKING AROUND. FOR TROUBLE... THEY SAY IT COMES IN THREES. I WONDER WHAT THE NEXT TWO WILL BE. HEY, YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE. GET OUT! IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, T.J. DO YOU WANT TO GET YOURSELF KILLED? WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S ALWAYS TRYING IT OUT THERE. DON'T START THAT AGAIN. YOU AND ME ARE GONNA HAVE A NICE QUIET LITTLE TALK, SEÑORITA, OR I MIGHT JUST DECIDE TO PUT YOU ACROSS MY KNEE. FAT CHANCE. THIS IS T.J., REMEMBER? SURE, I REMEMBER. IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE TO CHANGE. WELL, GO ON. GO AHEAD. YOU HESITATED UP THERE, BEFORE THE JUMP. THE SIGHT OF YOU WOULD UPSET YOUR OWN MOTHER. YOU'RE NOT PULLING MUCH OF A CROWD, ARE YOU? WE PLAY VILLAROSA NEXT WEEK. THINGS WILL BE BETTER THERE. YOU SURE? SURE, I'M SURE. WHY IS THAT? WHAT DO YOU CARE? YOU'VE GOT YOUR OWN BUSINESS NOW. YEP, THAT'S RIGHT. A ONE-MAN OPERATION. SITTING IN A NICE PLUSHY OFFICE, BUYING AND SELLING ACTS, INSTEAD OF GETTING KNOCKED-OFF HORSES FOR 10 BUCKS A DAY. IT'S HALF THE RISK, TWICE THE PAY. SO MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS. I'M DOING JUST THAT. I'VE GOT A DEAL FOR YOU, T.J. GET YOU OFF THE HOOK WITH THIS BROKEN-DOWN, MOTH-EATEN RODEO. IF YOU'VE STILL GOT A BRAIN IN THAT PRETTY HEAD OF YOURS, THANKS. YOU'LL TAKE IT. BUFFALO BILL WANTS TO BUY OMAR, THE WONDER HORSE. HE'S OFFERING A GOOD PRICE. AND YOU GET 1O%, RIGHT? 20. WELL, YOU ARE NOT GETTING ONE THIN DIME OUT OF ME. AND BUFFALO BILL IS NOT GETTING OMAR. AND YOU NEEDN'T THINK YOU CAN COME BUSTING IN HERE LIKE SOME HICK-TOWN HORSE DEALER, TRYING TO RUIN MY SHOW. THERE'S PEOPLE DEPENDING ON ME... CHAMP, CARLOS, BEAN, ROWDY. BUT THEN YOU WOULDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT LOYALTY, WOULD YOU? THIS IS BUSINESS. YOU PLAY YOUR CON TRICKS, AND I'LL STICK TO HORSE TRICKS. NOW, BEAT IT! MY, MY, YOU ALWAYS DID LOOK SWEET IN A TEMPER. GET OUT, I SAID! ALL RIGHT. I'VE GOT HOTTER IRONS IN THE FIRE, HONEY. YOU JUST KEEP STRUGGLING ALONG LEAPING OFF PLATFORMS INTO A POT OF WATER. GO AHEAD, BREAK YOUR NECK IF YOU WANT TO. MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME. GOOD. JUST WORRIED ABOUT THAT HORSE UP THERE WITH YOU. WOULDN'T LIKE TO SEE ANYTHING HAPPEN TO HIM. OHH! EXCUSE ME. GOOD FOR YOU, T.J. YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT A LONG TIME AGO... THROWN HIM OUT. I SAY! HELLO THERE! OVER HERE, SIR. SOMEONE YOU KNOW? A CLIENT OF MINE. PROFESSOR BROMLEY. WHAT'S HE DOING OUT THERE? HE DIGS FOR OLD BONES AND THINGS. HELLO! SOUNDS LIKE HE DUG HIMSELF INTO TROUBLE. COME ON! I SAY, THANK HEAVENS YOU CAME ALONG. WHAT HAS HAPPENED, PROFESSOR? WHAT HAS HAPPENED, PROFESSOR? YOU KNOW VERY WELL WHAT HAS HAPPENED. ROSITA? ROSITA. ROSITA'S MY MULE. SHE ABSOLUTELY REFUSED TO BUDGE. THEN SHE KICKED ME. I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE'S GONE NOW. YOU HURT? HA HA. THERE ARE NO BONES BROKEN, BUT IT'S FRIGHTFULLY PAINFUL. OH, BY THE WAY, I DON'T BELIEVE WE'VE MET. MY NAME IS BROMLEY. HI. NAME'S TUCK KIRBY. HOW DO YOU DO? HOP ON. WE'LL GIVE YOU A RIDE BACK. UH, WELL, UH, PERHAPS LOPE'S MOUNT MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE PRACTICAL. WAIT! WHOA. MY BOY. HUP! ALL RIGHT. YOU OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER THAN TO GET BEHIND A STUBBORN MULE, PROFESSOR. YOUR ADVICE COMES A LITTLE LATE, MR. KIRBY. LOOK, PROFESSOR! ROSITA HAS FOUND HER WAY HOME! VICIOUS BEAST. GIVE ME YOUR SHOULDER, LOPE. WELL, I'D SAY YOU COULD USE A GOOD STIFF DRINK, PROFESSOR. YOU'RE RIGHT, MR. KIRBY, IT'S IN THE TRUNK THERE. LOPE TELLS ME YOU'RE ONE OF THESE, UH, ONE OF THESE ARCHAEOLOGIST FELLOWS. WELL, HE'S PRETTY NEAR THE MARK. ACTUALLY, I'M A... PALEONTOLOGIST. OH. WE DIG DEEPER. MY FATHER USED TO SAY IT IS NOT GOOD TO DIG UP THE PAST. LET SLEEPING DOGS LIE, EH? HA HA. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET VERY FAR THAT WAY, NOW, ARE WE? THAT SORT OF DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU WANT TO GET TO, DOESN'T IT? TO THE BOTTOM OF THINGS, OF COURSE. WHAT DARWIN DID WITH HIS THEORY OF EVOLUTION, I INTEND TO DO WITH MY THEORY OF THE HUMANOIDS. HUMANOIDS? IT MEANS MANLIKE. IT'S GENERALLY BELIEVED AMONGST PALEONTOLOGISTS THAT MAN FIRST EVOLVED ABOUT A MILLION YEARS AGO. I INTEND TO PROVE IT WAS MANY EONS BEFORE THAT. IF YOU'D LIKE TO LOOK IN THAT TRUNK, YOU'LL FIND A PIECE OF ROCK. WILL YOU GET IT? THAT'S IT? NOW LOOK AT THE FOSSIL, THE IMPRESSION LEFT IN THE ROCK. IT LOOKS LIKE SOME SORT OF A FOOTPRINT. PRECISELY. IT'S AN EOHIPPUS! EO... EOHIPPUS. THE SO-CALLED DAWN HORSE... THE ANCESTOR OF OUR PRESENT-DAY HORSES. I NEVER SAW A HORSE SMALL ENOUGH TO LEAVE A PRINT LIKE THAT, NOT EVEN A NEWBORN COLT. YOU NOTICE IT HAD 3 TOES? OVER THE PERIOD OF EVOLUTION, HORSES HAVE GROWN MUCH LARGER. AND THAT CENTER TOE HAS BECOME THE HOOF AS WE KNOW IT TODAY. IINCREIBLE! SI, INCREIBLE. WHAT IS MORE INCREDIBLE IS THE FOSSIL BESIDE IT. I'M CONVINCED THAT IS THE TIBIA OF SOME HUMANOID THAT EXISTED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE EOHIPPUS, POSSIBLY MORE THAN... 50 MILLION YEARS AGO. YOU FOUND THIS THING AROUND HERE? IN THE FOOTHILLS. THIS IS MY WHOLE LIFE, MR. KIRBY, BUT I NEED TIME AND MONEY. MY RESOURCES, BOTH FINANCIAL AND, UH, PHYSICAL, ARE RUNNING PRECARIOUSLY LOW. WELL, PROFESSOR, WHAT YOU NEED IS A GOOD REST. YES, MR. KIRBY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS. LOPE. HEY, I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS YOUR MIDDLE TOE, DID YOU? HMM? T.J. YEAH? CAN I SPEAK TO YOU A MOMENT? OF COURSE. IN PRIVATE. I KNOW. YOU WANT THAT MONEY I OWE YOU. DON'T WORRY. YOU'LL GET IT. WE'LL PACK THEM IN WITH OUR NEW ATTRACTION. YES, EL DIABLO WILL BE A BIG SUCCESS. SHH. QUIET. THAT'S BETWEEN US. IT'S NOT ONLY MONEY. WHAT ELSE? US, TOGETHER. YOU AND ME AND EL DIABLO, WE CAN... IN THE MEANTIME, LET'S SEE HOW WE GO IN VILLAROSA, EH? EHE, TORO. IAI-YAH, TORO! HA HA HA HA! IAY-YAH, TORO! "EHE! HI THERE, HON! I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO GO. ABOUT THAT DEAL. SO GO! I GUESS YOU'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT A LOT, HMM? NOTHING HAS BEEN FURTHER FROM MY MIND, WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF YOU. "YAH. AY-YAH, TORO! HEY, TORO! HEY, TORO! HEY, HEY! "TORO! LOPE! HEY, TORO! HEY, HEY, TORO! TUCK! DARLING, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? CUT IT OUT, TUCK, IF YOU WANT ME TO GET ON WITH THE REPAIRS. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT EASY FOR ME TO KEEP STILL WITH YOU HANGING AROUND ME LIKE THAT. WHO WAS THAT FELLOW WHO JUMPED THE BULL, ANYWAY? HMM? OH, CARLOS. I'M GLAD HE WAS THERE. HE SAVED YOUR LIFE. YEAH. WHY DID YOU WALK OUT ON ME, TUCK? I WAS READY TO SELL OUT, TO MARRY YOU. THAT'S ALL I EVER WANTED. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. I DIDN'T WANT TO. GETTING MARRIED IS LIKE BEING A HORSE TIED UP IN A CORRAL. I NEVER COULD TAKE BEING ALL ROPED UP LIKE THAT. T.J., YOU KNOW WHAT? MM-HMM? I JUST KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL ME OMAR. HMM? THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'VE GOT A DEAL. WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT'S GOING ON? NOTHING. ANYTHING FOR YOU, BABY. DON'T GIVE ME ANY OF THAT "BABY" STUFF. WHAT'S THE PITCH? CARLOS BROUGHT ME A NEW ACT. WHAT KIND OF AN ACT? STICK AROUND, COME TO THE OPENING AT VILLAROSA... NO, NO, I MEAN NOW. ALL RIGHT. I'LL SHOW YOU TONIGHT. BUT FIRST, THE PATIENT MUST REST, OR HE MIGHT HAVE A RELAPSE, AND RELAPSES CAN BE FATAL. T.J., I WANT TO KNOW... NOW LIE STILL. DOESN'T IT HURT TO MOVE? TERRIBLE. MEET EL DIABLO. WELL, IF THAT DON'T BEAT ALL. YOU WANT A LITTLE SUGAR, DON'T YOU? WHERE'D YOU EVER GET A CRITTER LIKE THAT? CARLOS FOUND HIM. HE MUST HAVE BEEN IN A GOLD MINE, 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE IS... SOLID GOLD. IT TOOK A WHILE TO TRAIN HIM, BUT NOW HE'S ABOUT READY FOR HIS DEBUT. WELL, WHAT'S THE ACT? WE STRAP A PLATFORM ONTO OMAR'S BACK, AND EL DIABLO WALTZES ON TOP. A HORSE DANCING ON HORSEBACK. HA HA. THAT'S GOT TO BE A HUMDINGER. I CAN SEE IT ALL NOW. PRESENTING EL DIABLO, THE WORLD'S ONE AND ONLY MINIATURE HORSE. WE ARE ON OUR WAY TO A FORTUNE. AMAZING. IT'S ABSOLUTELY ASTOUNDING. IT WAS THOSE 3 TOES THAT STARTED ME THINKING. AND 4 ON ITS HIND FEET. GREAT SCOTT, IT COULD BE... AN EO... WHATSIT. HIPPUS. EOHIPPUS, YES. EOHIPPUS, IF YOU ARE ONE... WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE OVER 5O MILLION YEARS AFTER YOU SHOULD BE EXTINCT? IT COULD BE A FREAK OF NATURE, OF COURSE. WELL, IS THERE ANY WAY YOU CAN TELL? BY CHECKING ITS ORIGIN. IF I COULD PROVE THAT THIS IS THE GENUINE ARTICLE, I SHALL UNDOUBTEDLY RECEIVE A KNIGHTHOOD, MR. KIRBY, FOR THE GREATEST SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY OF THE AGE. THE GREATEST SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY OF THE AGE? T.J. DOESN'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S GOT HERSELF. SIR HORACE BROMLEY. IT'LL LOOK GREAT IN LIGHTS. GALILEO, NEWTON, AND BROMLEY... BUFFALO BILL, BARNUM & BAILEY. BROMLEY... OR THE RINGLING BROTHERS. YES, YES, WE'LL PLAY ONE OFF AGAINST THE OTHER, SELL TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER, MAKE 'EM BEG. POSSIBLY LORD BROMLEY. WE'D MAKE A KILLING. WE MUST FIND OUT WHERE THIS LITTLE HORSE CAME FROM, MR. KIRBY. LET'S FIND THIS GUY CARLOS. IMPOSSIBLE. BUT, MY DEAR FELLOW, I HAVE NO COMMERCIAL INTEREST IN EL DIABLO. I'M A SCIENTIST. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU ARE. T.J. HAS GIVEN AWAY OUR SECRET, DESTROYING ALL MY DREAMS. OH, COME, NOW, BE REASONABLE. REASON IS SOMETHING MY PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND. THAT OLD BLIND WITCH TIA ZORINA TELLS THEM SUPERSTITIOUS NONSENSE ABOUT EL DIABLO, AND THEY BELIEVE IT. THE LEAST YOU COULD DO IS SHOW US WHERE THE CAMP IS. I DON'T WANT ANY MORE TROUBLE. YOU'VE CAUSED ENOUGH ALREADY. WELL, THANKS FOR YOUR HELP, CARLOS. WHAT HELP? TIA ZORINA. CAMP. WE CAN SURE FIND WHERE THAT CAMP IS. HOW? WHY, LOPE. LOPE? SURE. LISTEN, THAT KID COULD FIND A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK AND SELL IT FOR A PROFIT. I'M NOT KIDDING YOU. IOLE! IOLE! iOLE! MADAM, I AM PREPARED TO PAY A GUIDE HANDSOMELY. TO LEAD YOU TO THE FORBIDDEN VALLEY? NO. NOT FOR ALL THE GOLD IN THE WORLD. WHAT'S THIS FORBIDDEN VALLEY? FROM THERE CAME THE LITTLE HORSE. AND UNTIL HE IS RETURNED, A GREAT EVIL WILL FALL UPON US. RUBBISH! I TELL YOU, UNLESS THE LITTLE HORSE IS RETURNED, WE SHALL ALL SUFFER THE CURSE OF HELL. SUPERSTITIOUS CLAPTRAP. THERE'S NOTHING HOCUS-POCUS ABOUT THAT LITTLE HORSE. DON'T YOU REALIZE WE'VE DISCOVERED A LIVING SPECIMEN OF THE EOHIPPUS? WHAT, YOU MEAN THAT THING REALLY IS AN EOHIPPUS? OF COURSE! WELL, NATURALLY WE SHALL HAVE TO PROVE IT BY SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. WELL, WE AREN'T GETTING ANY SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH DONE HERE, ARE WE, PROFESSOR? UH, IF YOU CAN'T HELP ME, PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU. IF YOU KNEW WHERE THE LITTLE HORSE WAS HIDDEN, WHAT WOULD YOU DO? RETURN IT TO THE FORBIDDEN VALLEY. WELL... A CENTAVO FOR YOUR THOUGHTS, SEÑOR. OH, HIYA, LOPE. LIMONADA, POR FAVOR. YOU LOOK UNHAPPY, SEÑOR. WELL, I GOT A PROBLEM, LOPE. I'VE BEEN WRESTLING WITH IT FOR HOURS. SOMETIMES IT HELPS TO TELL AN AMIGO. HMM. WELL, IT'S LIKE THIS, AMIGO. I MADE A BIG DISCOVERY LAST NIGHT. IF I TELL THIS FRIEND ABOUT IT, IT COULD HELP HER A LOT. SHE COULD MAKE A FORTUNE. BUT IF SHE MAKES A FORTUNE, IT MIGHT NOT HELP ME. NOW, WHAT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT IS WHY I'M SITTING HERE TRYING TO HELP A FRIEND MAKE A FORTUNE WHEN ALL I GOTTA DO IS BE QUIET ABOUT IT AND MAKE A FORTUNE MYSELF. SAVVY? I SAVVY VERY WELL, SEÑOR. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT. LOVE. NAH! LOVE'S FOR LATINS. WHEN MY MAMA WAS ALIVE, SHE USED TO TELL ME, "LOPE, WHEN YOU HELP SOMEONE YOU LOVE, YOU HELP YOURSELF." HERE. LIMONADA FOR FREE ADVICE. MUCHAS GRACIAS. DE NADA. YOU SURE DO KNOW HOW TO HELP YOURSELF, LOPE. WHAT'S THE BIG DISCOVERY, SEÑOR? OH, NO, NO, NO. YOU'LL END UP WANTING A CUT. WHY? I'M DOING FINE ON MY OWN. OH, YEAH, I SEE. AND WIDENING YOUR HORIZONS. SORRY, SEÑOR? I MEAN, YOU'RE GOING ON A JOURNEY. WITH THE PROFESSOR. WITH THE PROFESSOR? I MUST MEET HIM TONIGHT, WITH THE MULE, OUTSIDE THE ARENA. WELL, THAT'S IT, AMIGO. NO MORE FIGURING. I GOT THE FEELING THAT CERTAIN FRIEND OF MINE IS NEEDING SOME HELP RIGHT NOW. UHH! OHH... AH. SI, SI, SI. IVAMOS! COME ON, COME ON. AYY. HEY, TUCK! TUCK, WHAT'S THE HURRY? LOPE, COME HERE. WE ARE IN LUCK, CHICO. THEY'VE GOT IT. KIRBY, LET THEM GO! DON'T BE A FOOL, MAN! COME ON, CHICO. WE MUSTN'T LOSE THEM. WHAT HAPPENED? HE HIT ME. WHO? YOUR FRIEND KIRBY. WHAT? I CAUGHT HIM AND SOME OF MY PEOPLE STEALING EL DIABLO. STEALING... WHY, THAT DIRTY... NO, NO. NOT TUCK. COME ON, T.J. WE JUST SAW HIM WITH OUR OWN EYES. HE'S NO GOOD, T.J. CHAMP, GET BEAN AND ROWDY. YOU BET. WHOA! COME ON. LOOK HERE. TUCK'S GOT COMPANY. WE'RE HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. HE'S WORKING WITH THE PROFESSOR. HE WAS SPEAKING OF SCIENTIFIC INTERESTS. SCIENTIFIC INTERESTS, MY EYE. TUCK WANTS EL DIABLO FOR BUFFALO BILL. YOU SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO ME, T.J. HE'S RIGHT, T.J. THAT TUCK IS THE LOWEST. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. HE WAS RIGHT, I WAS WRONG. BUT IF WE STAND HERE, WE'LL NEVER CATCH HIM. I KNOW WHERE THEY MUST BE HEADING. THERE'S A SHORTCUT. TO WHERE? FORBIDDEN VALLEY. HELP! NOW, PROFESSOR, WHERE IS THAT LITTLE HORSE? I DON'T KNOW. YOU DON'T KNOW?! ALL RIGHT, SIR HORACE, WHEN THAT KING OF YOURS FINDS OUT YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A LOW-DOWN HORSE THIEF, HE'S SURE GONNA GIVE YOU A TOUCH OF THE SWORD, ALL RIGHT. YEAH, JUST ABOUT THERE! NOW, YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME WHERE EL DIABLO IS. YOU CAN MAKE IT EASY OR HARD ON YOURSELF. THAT'S UP TO YOU. WELL, UH... THE GYPSIES TOOK HIM. YOU PUT THEM UP TO IT! WELL, YES, IN A WAY, BUT IT'S GOING TO BENEFIT ALL OF US. OH, NOW, IS THAT A FACT? EL DIABLO... IS THE PROPERTY OF T.J. BRECKENRIDGE! I'M PROTECTING HER INTERESTS. WELL, SO AM I. DON'T YOU SEE? WE MUST FOLLOW THE GYPSY TRAIL TO THE FORBIDDEN VALLEY, BECAUSE WHERE THERE IS ONE EOHIPPUS, THERE MUST BE OTHERS. AT LEAST TWO, THE SIRE AND THE MARE. POSSIBLY MORE. JUST THINK WHAT YOU AND MISS BRECKENRIDGE COULD DO WITH A DOZEN EOHIPPI. FROM NOW ON, WE'RE PARTNERS? OH, NO, PROFESSOR. I MAKE IT A RULE NEVER TO SHAKE HANDS WITH AN ANXIOUS MAN. I'LL JOIN YOU, BUT NO DEALS. SEÑOR KIRBY! HEY. HI THERE, LOPE. SAY, WHAT'S THE PRICE OF WATER AROUND HERE? ONE PESO. TO YOU, HALF. OK. FLY, LITTLE ONE. FLY HOME TO YOUR MASTER. THIS CIRCLE OF MOUNTAINS, JAGGED PEAKS, STEEP CLIFFS... COULD BE THE PERFECT BARRIER AGAINST MAN AND THE ELEMENTS. NO WONDER THEY CALL IT THE FORBIDDEN VALLEY. YES. MIGHT BE THE ANSWER TO MANY THINGS. LIKE WHAT? WE SHALL SOON SEE, MR. KIRBY. ALL RIGHT, WE'LL CAMP HERE TONIGHT, START OUT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. WHAT'S THAT? QUICK! THE HORSES! WHERE'S ROSITA? SEÑOR KIRBY. PROFESSOR. LOOK. THERE'S BLOOD ALL AROUND. WHOA! WHOA, BOY. WHOA. YEAH, THE GYPSIES STOPPED HERE, AND EL DIABLO RAN OFF THAT WAY. SEÑOR KIRBY! PROFESSOR! NOW, HOW'D THEY GET HERE? I WAS AFRAID OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS. HEY! CHAMP, I CAUGHT MYSELF A HORSE THIEF. HOLD ON, T.J. YOU DON'T THINK I HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT? LOOK! THE EOHIPPUS! EASY. EASY. STAY HERE. NO. THAT'S NO GOOD. LET'S CHASE HIM ON HORSEBACK. GO GET HIM. HEY, YOU NEED ANY HELP? NOT FROM YOU. OH! I'VE GOT IT! TAKE YOUR THIEVING HANDS OFF HIM. HE'S MINE! WHATEVER YOU SAY, T.J.! TUCK KIRBY, I COULD SHOOT YOU! KEEP AFTER HIM, CHAMP! HEY, WE GOT HIM CORNERED. THE DEVIL WE HAVE. I CAN SEE DAYLIGHT IN THERE. HE MUST HAVE GONE CLEAR THROUGH. AH, WELL, THAT'S THAT, BECAUSE WE'RE NOT. LOOKS LIKE THE END OF THE ROAD. OPENS INTO ANOTHER WHOLE VALLEY THROUGH THERE. WIDER INSIDE. WIDE ENOUGH FOR THE HORSES. TAKE UP THE SLACK EASY. YEAH, YEAH. WHOA. TAKE HER AWAY. HYAH! HYAH! OK. THAT DID IT. COME ON, BOYS. NOW, AIN'T THAT SOMETHING? MAN, OH, MAN. HELLO! OH! HELP! GIDDUP! WHOA! HERE, WHAT'S THIS? I NEVER SAW TRACKS LIKE THAT. HEY, CHAMP. DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE? HOLY... WHAT'S THAT? IT LOOKS LIKE A PLUCKED OSTRICH. LET'S GET HIM FOR THE SHOW. WHAT THE... I'M GOING TO TRY AND FIND THE OTHERS. RIGHT. IT'S HIDEOUS. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. WHAT KIND OF BIRD IS IT, PROFESSOR. OH, NO BIRD. A GIANT PTERODACTYL, A FLYING REPTILE. IT'S BEEN EXTINCT FOR OVER 50 MILLION YEARS. THEN... WHAT'S IT DOING HERE? PRECISELY. WHAT IS IT DOING HERE? WHERE ARE THE OTHERS? BACK THERE. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE! GWANGI! TAKE OFF, T.J. LOPE IS HURT. CAN YOU RIDE? SI, SEÑOR. GET ON A HORSE, BOY. COME ON, PROFESSOR. COME ON. NO TIME FOR THAT. I CAN'T GO NOW. PROFESSOR, THERE'S A BIG LIZARD BACK THERE AND HE'S HEADING THIS WAY. NOW GET ABOARD! LEAVE ME ALONE, MR. KIRBY. I'M NOT LEAVING NOW. COME ON, TUCK! OK, PROFESSOR. IT'S YOUR FUNERAL. GREAT SCOTT. I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN, MR. KIRBY. OH, BY GEORGE. A STYRACOSAURUS. WHOA! ALL RIGHT, CHAMP, TAKE A LOOK. HYAH. HEY! OK UP HERE. ROOM FOR THE HORSES AND EVERYTHING. LET'S GET UP THERE. WHAT ABOUT THE PROFESSOR? NOTHING WE CAN DO FOR HIM NOW. JUST HOPE HE'S ALIVE. ROWDY, YOU MUST BE PLUMB LOCO. NOW WHAT DID I DO? COME HERE. THESE CARTRIDGES ARE BLANKS. THEY'RE THE BLANKS WE USE IN THE SHOW. NO WONDER THE RIFLES DIDN'T DO ANY GOOD. HOW WAS I TO KNOW? HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO WAKE A FELLA FROM A SOUND SLEEP READY FOR A SHOOT-OUT? HEY, FORGET IT. HERE. MAYBE WE CAN USE THESE. SEE IF YOU CAN CUT THAT INTO A SPEAR. I DON'T TAKE ORDERS FROM NO HORSE THIEF. ALL RIGHT, NOW TELL ME, JUST WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HORSE THIEF? ALL RIGHT, BREAK IT UP, BREAK IT UP! THAT'S ENOUGH. WE'LL SETTLE ALL OF THIS LATER. NO. WE'LL SETTLE IT RIGHT NOW. LOPE. IT WAS THE PROFESSOR AND THE GYPSIES. CARLOS SAID YOU DID IT. CARLOS? YOU NEVER DID BRING ANYTHING BUT TROUBLE TO T.J. ALL RIGHT. STOP IT! WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, CIVILIZATION? WE'VE ALL GOT TO STICK TOGETHER UNTIL WE GET OUT OF THIS. IN ALL MY TRAVELS, I NEVER SAW NOTHING LIKE THAT 2-TON LIZARD. IF WE COULD JUST GET HIM BACK ALIVE. THE ONLY THING I WANT TO GET BACK ALIVE IS ME. THAT DOES IT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT OF THE CAVE? YOU WANT TO GET YOURSELF KILLED? NOT ANYMORE. WHAT'S THAT FOR? THAT'S A TRAP... IN CASE ONE OF THOSE LITTLE LIZARDS DECIDES TO MOSEY UP THIS WAY. A HOLE IN THE GROUND COULD SWALLOW ME UP, TOO. CAN'T TELL A FRIEND FROM AN ENEMY. COCKEYED FEMALE. DON'T THEY SLEEP NIGHTS? COME ON, COME ON! IT'S GONE. YEAH, TEMPORARILY. TUCK, I'VE DECIDED. I'M GOING TO SELL OUT. WELL, THAT'S GREAT, IF WE EVER GET BACK TO OMAR. NOT JUST OMAR. THE WHOLE SHOW... LOCK, STOCK, AND BARREL. THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED, ISN'T IT? WELL, SURE. SURE. OH, SOUND HAPPIER. WELL... I DON'T KNOW, T.J. I'VE... I'VE BEEN ON MY OWN SO LONG. I'VE BEEN ON MY OWN, TOO. I KNOW, I KNOW. BUT NOT LIKE ME. I MEAN REALLY ON MY OWN. I HAD TO CON AND PITCH, HUSTLE MY WAY INTO WHATEVER I AM NOW, AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THAT IS. TUCK, I DON'T CARE. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, T.J. I'LL TELL YOU. I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR SOMETHING ALL OF MY LIFE. YEAH? IT TOOK A LOT OF FINDING, BUT I FINALLY FOUND IT. YES? THE MOST BEAUTIFUL, GOLDARNEDEST RANCH YOU EVER SAW. RANCH? YEAH. IN WYOMING. DON'T YOU SEE? WE COULD BOTH SELL OUT, BUY THE PLACE, BUILD IT UP INTO A REALLY BIG RANCH, RAISE A BUNCH OF CATTLE AND HORSES. AND KIDS, MAYBE? YEAH. YOU... TALKING ABOUT SETTLING DOWN? SURE YOU CAN MAKE IT, TUCK? WELL, I... I WON'T KNOW TILL I GIVE IT A TRY, WILL I? BEAN! ROWDY! BRING TORCHES! IT WORKED! I SAY, UP THERE, WATCH YOUR STEP. THERE SEEMS TO BE A BIT OF A DROP HERE.

GWANGI HAS KILLED CARLOS, JUST AS HE KILLED HIS BROTHER MIGUEL. WELL, HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT? IN A DREAM I SAW IT... THE GREAT JAWS SNAPPING, THE RIDERLESS HORSE. HE WAS DOOMED. AND SO WILL YOU BE DOOMED, ALL OF YOU, UNLESS THE EVIL ONE IS SET FREE. BALDERDASH, MY GOOD WOMAN. BALDERDASH. HE'S NO MORE EVIL THAN AN ALLIGATOR. THE ONLY THING THAT'S EVIL ABOUT HIM ARE HIS JAWS. SPELL? HE CAN CAST NO SPELLS. COME ON. LET'S MOVE OUT. DEFY THE LAW AND PERISH! IN THE NAME OF WORLD SCIENCE, I BEG YOU, I IMPLORE YOU TO THINK AGAIN. LATER, PROFESSOR. WE'VE GOT A SHOW TO PUT ON. A SHOW? A SHOW? BUT IT'S DISGRACEFUL TO THINK OF PUTTING THIS FABULOUS CREATURE ON DISPLAY IN A CHEAP CIRCUS. WE CAN DO WHAT WE LIKE WITH GWANGI. HE IS OUR PROPERTY. HE BELONGS TO US ALL, TO MANKIND, TO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH! EASY, PROFESSOR. YOU CAN DO YOUR RESEARCH IN THE TIME WE GIVE YOU. YOU CAN FOLLOW US ON OUR WORLD TOUR. YOU MUST BE MAD, RAVING MAD. WORLD TOUR. WE'LL SEE WHAT THE ROYAL SOCIETY HAS TO SAY ABOUT THIS! WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT A WORLD TOUR? I'VE GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT. WE PLAY LONDON, PARIS, MADRID, AND THEN... WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE FORGETTING SOMETHING, AREN'T YOU? OH, YES. NEW YORK. NO, NOT NEW YORK. WYOMING. THAT RANCH. WE TALKED ABOUT IT, REMEMBER? YES, BUT THAT WAS BEFORE. LOOK, T.J., THIS SHOW WAS GOING TO BE IT. I MEAN, THE REASON I HELPED YOU WAS SO THAT CHAMP, BEAN, ROWDY, ALL OF YOU COULD GET PAID OF HANDSOME, FROM A SHOW THAT'S REALLY WORTH BUYING. BUT NOW IT'S WORTH SAVING. TUCK, CAN'T YOU SEE? WE CAN DO THE TOUR, THEN BUY THE RANCH. NO. NO, WE CAN'T. NOT YOU AND ME. NOT NOW. SAME OLD TUCK. OH, NO. NOT THE SAME OLD TUCK, BUT A NEW KIND OF T.J., SUDDENLY ALL CAUGHT UP IN THE WORLD OF GLITTER. WELL, LEAVE ME OUT, 'CAUSE THAT DREAMBOAT'S ON THE ROCKS BEFORE IT SAILS. AS YOU LIKE. "AS YOU LIKE"? WELL, THAT'S IT. I GUESS IT IS. FIGURES. WELL, I'M SORRY FOR YOU, HON, 'CAUSE YOU'RE HEADING FOR A PLACE I JUST LEFT. I KNOW THAT PLACE. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT MUCH. SEÑORITA, YOU MUST GO AFTER MR. KIRBY. HE'S A VERY PROUD MAN, AND HE'LL NEVER COME BACK. TUCK! BACK! BACK! QUIET HIM DOWN! QUIET HIM DOWN! PLEASE, SEÑOR, I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN! BACK! BACK!
