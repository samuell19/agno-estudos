Okay, here are the two copies, Mom. I got it. I'm ready. And again, by the way, feel free to say "yuck." But you know, you, feel free to say, "Mom don't say that." Okay? Uh, okay. "That Joseph Paul Franklin was crazy, there could be little doubt." The New York Times called me "The Slayer". I like the term "multiple slayer" better than serial killer anyway. You know what I'm saying? Got it? Okay. "No, not 'cause he hated Jews. Lots of ostensibly sane people hate Jews. Bigotry and insanity are different, at least my mother thought so." Wait, can you hold on one sec? It's saying "bigotry and insanity" then it goes from there to, "My mother..." "My mother seemed to know the names of every anti-Semite alive and dead. Henry Ford, Richard Wagner, Joe Kennedy, even Walt Disney." And then I have in quotes: "'Not Walt Disney, Mom!'" Unquote, okay? Close quote. "'Yes, Walt Disney,' she declared. Still, she took me to see Bambi and I cried and cried." Now it goes up to the upper left-hand corner, okay? Dot, dot. Got it? The memories that come back to me when I'm, you know, when I'm writing, they have nothing to do with the case, but it's sort of fun. Now we're going back to, "As I write this... ...I ask myself why I agreed to examine Mr. Franklin." How are you supposed to act if you've killed people? You know? You're supposed to have blood dripping from your mouth and all that? Fangs? "How could I be certain that I would not be prejudiced? Looking back in time I think examining Mr. Franklin was as close as I would ever come to examining Hitler. Hitler has always been a mystery. A man responsible for the deaths of so many but someone who, to the best of my knowledge, never personally killed anyone." "My regret is that nobody had the chance to study him, to find out what made him tick. How did he get that way? Could I get that way? Could anyone?" "I look back on the many killers I have come to know over the past four decades. There are diagnoses I make now that I didn't even know existed because of my own ignorance," comma, "because I didn't ask the right questions." It's nice to be able to correct one's mistakes. More often, we probably don't even know when we make them. Doctor, looking at the evidence of this case, are you able to tell us whether the defendant is insane or not? CRAZY, NOT INSANE THE NUREMBERG TRIALS When I was very little, I remember reading about the Nuremberg Trials. In Berlin, the defendants are to plead guilty or not guilty. Lying on the carpet, we lived in New York in an apartment, and the newspaper in front of me, and seeing pictures of Goebbels and Goering. Defendant Hermann Wilhelm Goering, the International Military Tribunal sentences you to death by hanging. I was aware that people were deliberately killing other people, and I was aware of my own anger and my own aggression. And I remember thinking: "How come I don't kill? How come when I get so angry I don't kill?" It's fascinated me. I've been horrified by the fact that, I think any one of us, myself included, could become a Nazi. Maybe I went to medical school or became a psychiatrist in part to learn about why. Don't you ever wonder why you don't murder? - I do. - Yeah. "I never planned to work with violent people, certainly not murderers. I went through medical school in order to become a psychoanalyst. I saw myself in a private office, seated behind a supine patient..." listening and commenting as he struggled to resolve the violent internal conflicts between his id and superego. Instead, a series of unexpected events drew me deeper and deeper into the study of violence. In the early 70s, I was working at the Juvenile Court Clinic in New Haven, examining delinquents. Most of the delinquents who crossed the threshold of my office had horrendous backgrounds: car accidents, falls, burns, even carbon monoxide poisoning. A good number of the injuries were not caused by reckless drivers, broken tree branches, or overturned coffee pots. They were caused by parents. Gradually I was gathering clues. I was discovering why one person cried in pain, while another lashed out in response to it. I managed to get a small grant to study the prisoners on the Bellevue Forensic Wards. I examined Mark David Chapman, the man who shot John Lennon. We also saw a less famous, but more flamboyant inmate who cut off his father's head and penis and chucked both out the window. It was a colorful period. So, how did you first start working with Dorothy? By accident, yeah, so I saw this ad for a research assistant. "Juvenile delinquents" is what the ad says, "grant to do a project having to do with delinquency." It happened to be Dorothy, I happened to say "I'll give it a shot," we hit it off and it started everything. We became a bit of a team working together and we saw so many children at Bellevue. A study of the patients on our Childrens' Psychiatric Ward revealed that of 55 children admitted in one year, 21 had been homicidal. One child was admitted after trying to strangle her sister, another set fire to the couch on which his mother slept, a four-year old held a knife to his mother's throat. We tried to look at the variables. Was there any difference between the homicidal young children and the ones who were on the psychiatric ward, but had not been homicidal. And we found that the homicidal kids were much more likely to have been abused and they were much more likely to have signs of organic impairment, brain dysfunction. I was an ambitious academic neurologist at the time, and a faculty at Yale. I thought that there was nothing neurologically wrong with violent people. She convinced me to participate in the study. What's the relationship between the brain damage and the behavior? What we saw was if you have battered a child, shaken it, knocked it against the wall, then you could often see little hemorrhages in the brain. Sometimes that distinguished the super aggressive kids from the psychiatrically-ill but not aggressive kids. I had written an article in a psychiatric journal and Diane Sawyer, her assistants had read it, and they called me and she wanted to interview me. We're going to take a closer look at violent children, teenagers or... It was the first time I'd ever been on television. Doctor Lewis, thank you very much for coming this morning. It's a fascinating study and a pioneering one as I understand it. We did a study of the medical histories from hospital records... I talked about the brain dysfunction and the history of abuse that a lot of the violent kids had. Forty six percent had major neurological problems... Either that day or the next day I got a call from Dick Burr, just an incredible public defender, and he said, "I saw you on the news yesterday." She's talking about how you can't begin to evaluate somebody who's committed a violent crime unless you have a really thorough and complete life history. And at that point in the death penalty defense community, we had always thought mental health was important, but we didn't understand it. He said, "I have a client on death row here in Florida." We had a case, William Elledge, that I was the primary lawyer on, moving into the state post-conviction process. "Would you be willing to come down to death row and examine him?" And she came and helped us and taught us. Sure enough, the guy had brain dysfunction and a history of hideous abuse. A few weeks later, I saw I got a call again, "We have another guy." His name was Nollie Martin. Apparently, someone had run over his head with a car and there was a dent in his head. So I wrote it up. A colleague of mine said to me, "Dorothy, think of it this way, if you put your finger in a haystack and you get tapped by a needle that's by chance. But if you put your finger in the haystack a second time and again you are stuck by a needle," he said, "there are a lot of needles there." When a murder happens you wonder why. I've always been of the view that there are some reasons that they happen, not because people are inherently bad or evil. I don't believe in evil. Anybody who pulls a trigger and squeezes a life out of somebody for the calculated reasoning of starting a race war where other people would be killed, is evil. Evil is a religious concept, it's not a scientific concept and what society wants to do with a person like that is up to society. But, it at least helps to know what motivates a serial killer or what motivates a sniper. Right, hatred, that's what's motivating, I mean... There's much more than that. You know, we all sort of just saw the light and began to realize from working with Dorothy that we had to get a lot more information about peoples' lives. We had defense attorneys from different parts of the country start to call us as a team to see their tough cases. These tended not to be open-and shut cases of people doing violent things, these were puzzles. I have now seen 22 serial killers, a lot of other plain old killers, but 22 serial killers. And what we tend to find is when you couple either a predisposition to psychosis and or some kind of brain dysfunction with a history of horrible, early, ongoing abuse, you get a super dangerous person. And, what is fascinating is you can find what were the social, the psychological, the biological forces that came together to create this murderous human being. You know it's like being a detective, which I love. I truly love it. - Thanks so much, thank you. - You're welcome. The only way to approach a drawing is to feel free. If you have that freedom in you it's gonna show in your drawing. As long as we keep in mind, stepping back, looking at what we doing and then going back and making changes. Changes are very important. I always say to the students, remember those first drawings you were doing, and then you were unhappy with them? Those drawings allows you actually to do what you have been doing now. So that's why I always talk about the process and making changes all the time. Any case I've worked on I came as a blank slate and saw whatever I saw. Over time the complete picture came to light. Early in my career, I evaluated a woman, Marie Moore. She lived in an apartment with her fourteen-year-old daughter and her daughter's boyfriend. The boyfriend was a particularly sadistic kind of person. Somehow Marie got sexually involved with the boyfriend and a girlfriend of her daughter came over and Marie and the boyfriend took her captive. They kept her naked, just in diapers. They handcuffed her and toe-cuffed her to the floor. They shoved things into every orifice that a person has. And then one day, the fourteen-year-old boy dragged her over to the bathroom and knocked her head against the tub and killed her. The body was discovered and they were arrested. The boy ratted on Marie, now it was the boy who had actually killed her. But being a juvenile he was offered a plea, and Marie was tried for this murder. I got a call from an attorney asking me whether I would do an evaluation of Marie. The lawyer said something to me about how he thought she was a multiple. Well, I had been trained that there was no such thing. I went to see her and she reminded me of me. I was wearing big glasses and she was wearing big glasses. We were talking and I asked her had anyone ever bothered her sexually and she said, "No, no, no, absolutely not." I had been told that people around her said that she changed, that sometimes her voice became gruff and she wanted to be called Billy. So I asked her about this and she said, "Well, people tell me that I get that way, that I become like a boy, but I don't remember it. I don't think so." It was getting to be about five o'clock and the investigator stuck his head in the door and he said, "You know, we have to go." And I said, "Marie I have to stop now but I'll be back to see you" and she said, 'Don't go,'" she said, "there's something I have to tell you," in just that tone. And so I sat and sat and I said, "You know, Marie, I really have to go." And then I gathered up my papers and I turned my back and put my hand on the doorknob and I hear behind me a voice that said, "Don't go!" You know the hairs on my arms stood up. And I turned around and I said, "Billy?" And he said, "Hello." I said, "Billy, how long have you known Marie?" And he said, "I've known her all her life." I said to him, "Did her father ever bother her in any way?" And Billy said "Sure he did. He used to put pencils in her vagina, in her rectum. When she was twelve years old he went to bed with her and he had sex with her." And I said, "Billy, I really need to talk to Marie again." But Billy said, "I could kill her, I could make her take pills, I could make her hang herself." That turned out to be the very first multiple, not the first I've ever seen, the first that I ever knew I saw. I had her have psychological testing and on the Rorschach test, which is a projective test, you look at inkblots and see what people see, and there are certain normal responses and certain psychotic kinds of responses, and Billy's test results were as psychotic as they come. And Marie had absolutely the most normal Rorschach that you would expect. I'm fascinated by how can there be such different functioning in the same brain. My daughter Gillian says, "Mom, you're the only one who does group therapy with one person." I would never again see people as I had before. My innocence, which sprang from ignorance, would be stripped away, and I would learn things about human beings that I had not been taught during my training as a psychiatrist, things most of us would rather not know. Violent alternate personalities are usually caricatures of evil, created in the minds of tormented children to take their pain and defend them against real or imagined enemies. They embody the strength, courage, and wiliness needed for a tortured child to survive. Though some mental health experts say Multiple Personality Disorder doesn't exist, the American Psychiatric Association says it does, calling it Dissociative Identity Disorder, and adding in most cases it involves severe abuse or trauma in childhood. Parts of the mind splitting from each other to keep pain away... Before Freud, people like Janet talked about consciousness at many different levels like streams running parallel to each other. Haven't you ever driven and been, kind of, into your own thoughts and you pass the exit that you meant to get off at, 'cause you were really thinking about something else? We all, from time to time, dissociate. It's a continuum. There are degrees all the way to where, for a period of time, the individual truly believes himself to be someone else. At Bellevue we ran a clinic for children with Dissociative Identity Disorder. And it became clear that it starts very, very, very early. I worked with one child, let's call her Nancy, and she had an alter named Amanda. Tell me Amanda, how old was 'Nancy' when you came? Around seven or eight. Seven or eight? What did you do for her? I talked to her. You talked to her? What about? What happened. Nancy was referred to me by a social worker. She had been abused by a relative. And he put his pri-pivate? Private part in my mouth and... I have videos of Nancy going through so many different kinds of stages. Also, Nancy kept a diary. Her different personas had different handwriting, different spelling. Alternate personalities leave evidence of their existence all over the place: teacher reports, social service records, medical charts, journals, diaries, drawings. All are pieces of that puzzle that reveal the picture of a divided, often fragmented mind. These constitute the evidence needed to show that multiple personality disorder existed years before the diagnosis was even considered. They are proof that the interviewer did not create the disorder. So, when you start to present some of your findings to other psychiatric colleagues, what was their reaction? Was it welcoming? Oh sure. No. If you were an esteemed clinician, researcher, psychologist, psychiatrist, you did not take that seriously. That was a bogus diagnosis. I got ridiculed a lot, at Yale where I showed some of the most poignant pictures of small children and you saw them switch, and you could give the history of what had happened to them. Even when they saw it, right in front of their faces, the head of one of the departments said, "There must be another explanation." And so I thought, "Tell me what it is, I'm open to that." But... So there was... I think there still is a skepticism. At Bellevue we had a lot of room to spread out our data and to video tape, and stuff like that. And then they hired someone who was very hostile to our work and took away all our space, and eventually I left. These files are filled with death row inmates or evaluations that we've done on murderers who were going to trial. They're also records of what we discovered, and then what the law was willing to accept. She was just snatched off the street. Found a body. Possibility of a strangulation. You would not be able to recognize the face of the body. Post-mortem mutilation of the victims. It is one of the most significant arrests. Arthur J. Shawcross. Served fifteen years in prison for the murder of two children. 1987 he was released on parole. He is a severely emotionally disturbed man. Claimed that he had cut out my brother's heart and ate that. Whether this defendant was legally insane, is a question of fact for you to decide. Arthur Shawcross was preparing to go to trial in Rochester, New York. Before I even laid eyes on the defendant, his lawyers had obtained an MRI of his brain. The MRI had shown that at the very tip of his right temporal lobe was a small, fluid cyst. The brain is a very sensitive organ. The tiniest scar or tumor or cyst can, under certain circumstances, trigger abnormal electric activity and seizures associated with bizarre, animalistic behaviors. Here is the frontal lobe. And the frontal lobes restrain. They're the part that kind of says, "I might want another piece of cake, but I'm not going to have it." Or "I might like to rape this lady, but maybe I can find some more appropriate... whatever." There's a deep part of the brain called the limbic system. This limbic system has to do with food, with sex, with anger, with you name it. It's the very primitive part of the brain. There are a lot of connections between the lobes and the limbic system. I think of it as reigns on a horse. So, with Shawcross, the cyst in his temporal lobe would excite the limbic system and put it out of whack. But then Jonathan Pincus said, "Dorothy, what about the scars in the frontal lobe?" And, you know, it's incredible. The reigns on the horse had been cut and he was triggered if somebody said, "I'll tell the police or I'll tell your mother." That would snap him and he would kill. - Do you know me? - No. I'm Dr. Lewis. Would it be okay to talk with you a little bit? Yeah? I videotaped Arthur Shawcross, yes. Yeah, oh he was a character. I want you to tell us about what happened. I just grab her by the shoulders and I'm laying on her. And, you know, she's trying to scoot out from under me, and I just panic, and I just grab her by the throat, and I said, "hold still." Some sensation come over me and I start sweating like crazy. And the daylight around me got brighter and brighter, and I didn't even hear the birds, didn't hear anything around me, and I just... From day one I said, "I think he has temporal lobe seizures," from everything he told me. The person may see very bright lights, the person may get nauseated, the person may feel headache or dizzy, followed by sleep. And I feel my, like, like I'm floating away. I'm not even in the car, but I can see in the car. It's hard, I can't explain it. It's okay you're doing fine. What do you see? What would happen is, the girl would be in his car or his van, and he would kill her and he'd fall sound asleep. And he'd wake up and it was kind of, "Oops I must have done it again." Opened up the door and, and pushed her out and she went right over the guardrail, laid on the ice, face down. Something that was telling about how his brain worked was we interviewed the wife separately, and she did not believe he had done anything bad. She saw him as this loving man who worked nights. He was a cook in a cafeteria and then he would be done early in the morning and her best guess was if he was going to commit a murder, it would be some time in the dark in the middle of the night or towards dawn. And he would tell his wife, "You know there's a serial murderer around. Don't go out." So when she told us that, at that point we had an inkling that there was something not right. I want to talk to the person that Art saw kill. - What's your name? - Bessie. - What is your name? - Bessie! - Buzzy? - Bessie! - Bessie? Who are you? - His mother. Really? Bessie, would you be good enough to sign your name for me? It became clear that Arthur Shawcross experienced dissociative states. At these times, he would hear his mother in his head berating him and the women he was seeing. No one was good enough for Artie. They should die. Bessie, did you hurt any of the girls? I hurt all of them. - What? - I hurt all of them. So how come he confessed to all of that stuff if you did it? He does everything I tell him to. Bessie, how did you kill them? Prove it. What did you do? He lifted up his fist. There was no way that I could get out, and I thought that he was going to attack me. - What's that in your hand, Bessie? - A knife. A knife? What are you gonna do with a knife? - What are you doing Bessie? - Cuttin'. Who are you cutting? - Who are you cutting? - A girl. One of his victims had been sliced from her neck all the way down to her pubic area. Art, what's happening? Mommy, you're biting me. Where is she biting you, Art? Where is she biting you, Art? Art, Art where is she biting you? She's biting your penis? What happened, Art? I had no question that Mr. Shawcross had been severely abused. School records described his mother as punishing and rejecting. In grade school, the young Arthur cowered under radiators while the other children sang songs. Psychological tests revealed a seriously disturbed child lost in a fantasy in which he perceived himself a new person. I don't know, I just... A funny feeling sometimes. I'm there, but it's like I'm not there. I'm fightin' with myself. It's like I'm two different people doing something bad. Opening arguments began today in the Shawcross murder trial and late this afternoon the first witnesses were called to the stand. Defense attorney, Thomas Cocuzzi, contends that his client's sanity is in question. Cocuzzi told jurors that he will put an expert psychiatrist, Dr. Dorothy Lewis on the stand. And you're going to hear aspects of his medical records and his school records and his prison records, reflecting his behavior, not since his arrest, but throughout his life. You were testifying for the defense? Yes, I was. But, what's interesting with him... To keep him from being executed? Not really 'cause it was New York and they don't execute people in New York. But the defense was arguing he should be in an institution, not in prison. And I had said to the lawyers, "We're gonna be educating the public. Look, you can show the jury pictures of the MRI. You can see the cyst, you can see the scars in the frontal lobe. Go with that." And they didn't. Instead they ran with the dissociative symptoms. Why did he have to be punished, Bessie? He did bad things with girls. But that's a much tougher diagnosis for a jury. I mean it just seems so fantastic. Bessie, how many people have you had to get rid of for him? - Eleven. - Eleven? Did you have any help? - No. - No? I had been tricked. What about the neurological findings? By the time I took the stand, it was clear that Shawcross's attorneys were not going to produce a neurologist. Your Honor, I was lied to and therefore I cannot credibly testify without clarifying what I was told, what I was told was being done, and then what I discovered finally. Dorothy had a hard time on the witness stand. She was always involved in so many things she would come to wherever the hearing was and she wouldn't have, sort of, gathered her thoughts and, you know, kind of systematized her thinking. Dorothy's not linear. And that's part of her genius. But it's also part of frustration in trying to bring her into a linear, a system that requires linearity like the legal system. Your Honor, may I please request a recess for 15 minutes, because I do not feel prepared to go on right now. I was repeatedly chastised by the Judge for not responding directly to questions with a succinct yes or no. I looked clumsy and disorganized. This is not the way psychiatry works, it is not the way... The prosecution hired Park Dietz, one of the most highly regarded forensic psychiatrists in the nation, a man who had been a consultant at the FBI and CIA. He was a handsome, confident man who never appeared hassled. It was very clear what was happening on the video tapes, that Dr. Lewis was inviting him to play various performances. She invited him to play the role of his mother, even telling him that he could take on the role of his mother and talk like his mother, and he even does it in a falsetto voice. Do you buy the whole idea of Multiple Personality Disorder? No. I think it's a hoax. I think it is a sad fact that people in my profession were so eager to find something that they did a form of interviewing that can cause vulnerable people to believe they have more than one personality. And now, we're going to count... Three... Now I want you to roll your eyes upwards but keep your eyes closed. Dr. Lewis subjected Shawcross to a kind of hypnosis during part of her interview. And you're going to open your eyes. And now you're gonna tell me what is happening. You don't like to use hypnosis if you can avoid it, but it was early in my career at the Shawcross trial. Hypnosis is questionable. People who can be hypnotized, can also... Are very suggestible. If you do use hypnosis, you want to confirm what was said either from other relatives, friends, hospital records, school records, you just can't believe everything. During a hypnotic session, he identified himself as a thirteen century cannibal. - Took his heart out. - Yeah. Cut his penis off. Testicles off. Took his testicles, yeah. - And then what? - Ate them. He exhibited none of that with me. Have you had some medical problems? I've got an injured elbow on my right side. He answered to his name, as he had to everybody else throughout his entire life, except Dorothy Lewis. And understood how, where, when, and why he did every one of those murders. I just panicked. She didn't scream, didn't holler, didn't struggle, didn't fight. And I choked her. Any popular notion that serial killers are crazy people is just wrong. We have no way to know how many men have as their favorite sexual fantasy, strangling a woman to death until her tongue protrudes from her mouth and you hear the last breath leave her body. But I bet it isn't related only to those few men who do that routinely. This was a guy who did some pretty grizzly things to his victims. Well, he ate the vagina of one of them and, you know, I thought that was pretty bizarre. And I've seen a lot. Nobody with the taste for that. I cut her from here down to here, cut the vagina, you know, cut the outer part out, and ate it. On the stand, Park Dietz said, "He ate the vagina to hide the DNA." "Surely, doctor, there must be an easier way to get rid of the evidence." Ultimately, it was my opinion that Shawcross was not insane under the law. That he knew what he was doing, knew it was wrong. "What kind of sane person would eat the vaginas of his victims?" I guess would be what an average person like me might say. One has nothing to do with the other. Whether you are responsible for a murder you did, is unrelated to whether you once ate a raw rabbit or a raw vagina. Cold, calculating, and remorseless, for whom killing was not an emotional disturbance... Siragusa was the prosecutor on the case and he was running for office. And so I think she was the recipient of his need to show that he's a tough guy on crime. Okay, you said... I said that they might have been caused by a stroke. Excuse me... Excuse me, Doctor, can you answer... Can you try, Doctor, just to answer my question? Can you hear me, Doctor? And he was going to put her into the mud because that would help his cause, and he did get elected. I would never say anything about Doctor Lewis other than to comment that, I think her performance in court speaks for itself. You know, Dorothy paved the way for a whole generation of mental health professionals who followed in her steps. But she was a pioneer and pioneers are often, you know, not treated well. I think there was an intuitive recognition on the part of prosecutors, that what she had to say bore heavily on the truth. And the truth is not what some prosecutors wanted. She swallowed the stories he told, hook, line, and sinker. So when you were on the stand the attorney on the other side, the prosecuting attorney was making fun of you for... Yes. ...thinking that there was such a thing as Multiple Personality... Yeah, yes, yeah. Or for anything else, you know. The local radio station made up jingles about me. The boys have written a song in Dorothy's honor, and hope it comes out alright. Hey look who's on the stand again Back to defend her killer friend Got her psychiatry degree Now she's on Arthur's side you see She tries to justify what's wrong Because his mother Played with his dong Hey hey! Yakety Yak! Dorothy's back. Hey! Alright! They were making fun of you because, just because you were on his side or because you were evincing a particular theory about him? How about all of the above, all of the above. You know... Yeah. Members of the jury, how do you find, in the matter of the People of the State of New York versus Arthur Shawcross? Guilty. It took the jury less than two hours to find Mr. Shawcross sane and guilty of the murders of ten women. It took me three years to recover from my three weeks on the stand. No one had believed a word I said. Do you think Dorothy Lewis let you down? No, don't you, don't block me please. I have no comment on Dorothy Lewis. Thank you. What's happening? No more. Was Arthur Shawcross crazy when he murdered his victims and consumed their genitalia? Of course, he had to be. Insane? Not necessarily. When a defense attorney hires you, in the legal system, for what purpose do they hire you? Well, you know, I don't really care for what purpose 'cause I do the same evaluation. They're probably hoping that I will find the person is stark raving mad. But... The law has a lot to learn from psychiatry, and instead psychiatry accepts the legal definition of what's crazy and what isn't crazy. They have a notion of competence and a notion of insanity, both of which don't make sense psychiatrically. There are different levels of competence. "Oh, well, I know what a courtroom is, a courtroom is where there's a judge and there's a jury." "And do you know what you're accused of?" "Oh, yeah, I'm accused of robbery, of murder, and of this..." Done. You know? Uh, he's competent. This is the law, period. In the Middle Ages in England, they had the death penalty. And the legal system had the view if somebody had become mad, that madness itself was enough punishment. That's part of the English Common Law that came with the English colonists to North America. At some point, though, in death penalty cases in the United States, that notion got lost, that madness was punishment enough, and people could be executed despite being very psychotic. And as late as the 1950s the U.S. Supreme Court had examined a case like that and said that it doesn't offend the Constitution, it's not cruel and unusual to do that. You're competent to be executed if you know what you've been found guilty of and if you know what it is to be executed. Now that's a pretty low bar, wouldn't you say? By and large, the law has taken on very simple-minded criterion that ignores all that we know now about how the human brain works, about some of the genetics of disorders. When Clinton was running for president, he was called back to Arkansas to sign a death warrant because he was governor. Apparently, Ricky Ray was used to having his dinner at a certain time and saving the dessert for later. And he saved his pecan pie for after the execution. Now, I would say he didn't know what it meant to be executed. But my colleagues found him perfectly competent to be executed. And I don't know who ate the pie. Mrs. Mooney has a pie shop Does good business But I've noticed something weird Lately all her neighbors' cats Have disappeared Wouldn't do in my shop Just the thought of it's enough To make you sick And I'm telling you Them pussycats is quick No denying times is hard, sir Even harder Than the worst pies in London More pies, more pies, more pies More pies Eat the flesh Eat his body Drink his blood I am haunted by the prospect of condemning to death a person whose upbringing and brain function have made it hard, if not impossible, for him to control his acts. Granted the person may be a menace. I have no problem locking him up and throwing away the key. Until we know how to treat such individuals, the public must be protected. I feel like committing suicide because... - Oh please don't do that. - Because I, you know, because of... Because of what, Max? Because of what happened to Michael. Max was brought to the prison ward at Bellevue, because this was the second time that he had tried to kill a lover. I was called by one of the doctors because they believed that he had Multiple Personality Disorder. I was asked to confirm the diagnosis, and then we kind of clicked. So I went to see him frequently. As far as we could tell, Max had been tortured by his mother. Where would she hit you? She used to say I'm gonna put you to bed so fast your head will swim. She used to knock you around, your head did feel like it was swimming. She punched, she punched and she's had big long nails and she used to rake them, she used to dig them into you. - Really? - Into your skin. Do you have any marks where she hurt you? Do I have any marks where she hurt me? I see marks here, little bit. Yeah. And also right there, marks where I had to kneel on glass. What do you mean kneel on glass? I had to, I'd broken some, and so she said, "Well clean it up." And so, she pushed me down the floor and I, you know, there was glass on the floor, and I said, "Well let me get up," and she said "Clean it up, you broke it, clean it up," she said. Stop it! - He is there now. - He hears whatever we... But you cannot see him? Why is it that we can see him and... Can you see him? - No. - He's there. You cannot see him? There was a very strong, often cruel part of him, Kalki, who was almost god-like in the way he viewed himself. I am Avatar. Whatever I do is for the benefit. Whatever I do is good. Whatever I do is good. But it is... But, Kalki, why was it good to stab Michael? He was the one who stabbed Max's lovers. It was the game. It was the game. And then there was Jabreel, and Jabreel was an old man, a zen monk. You see that is love there, that is love. She would hold him, sometimes... He seemed to have developed as a comforter for Max. Max also talked about a baby. He was a very bright young man and had some insight into what was going on in his head. So, we would say to him, "Max, if a twelve-year-old kid had the same kinds of switching that you have, what kinds of questions would you ask?" I would ask them if they had a place that they could go, that nobody else could go to. A place inside themselves where nobody else could go to, that would seem like, that no one else is there. And I would say, "Is it a beach? Is it trees?" I would say, "What is it? Where do you go? Where do you go when you just feel like going someplace else?" "'Cause it's a very special thing to do and not many people can do that. It's very special." - So you'd say it's very special? - I'd say, "It's very special." And then we would try it out on the kids, and he was spot on. That's how bright and insightful he was but he couldn't help himself. What games are you playing? The last time you played games you got him into a lot of trouble. What are you doing, Kalki? Don't pull that 'hm hm hm' on me. - Hello, Kalki? - I am here. Yeah I know you're there. I know you're there and I know most people don't talk to you straight. But I am miffed. I thought we had an agreement. - You and Jabreel had an agreement? - I thought we did. - We did not. - I thought we did. I thought we did, I thought that went... Do you speak any French? You know "ca va sans dire?" "It goes without saying." Maybe we clicked because I didn't play favorites. If you notice I am empathic to every one of them. Well Kalki certainly has a lot of strength. Yes, he is very strong, isn't he? You never bad mouth, especially the abuser. That is an, that's an invitation to murder. One day, I came into my office and my secretary handed me one of these telephone slips. And it said, "Mr. Scorsese's office has called and would like you to call back." So I called back and an assistant of his said, "Mr. Scorsese has discovered that you see murderers. Robert De Niro is going to be in a remake of Cape Fear, and he would like to meet some murderers. Can you arrange that?" You know it's so funny, I felt like, would you say a casting director? So, I asked Max. He really had attempted to murder twice. Oh yes, I could talk to him. Max said, sure he would talk with him. I said, "Well, how about Kalki?" Yes. "And Jabreel?" And Jabreel said: Yes. So, we made an arrangement for De Niro to go into the prison ward. At first, Max seemed puzzled and I said, "Max, you must know him, you've seen Taxi Driver." And he said, "No I've never seen Taxi Driver." I said, "Max, Mr. De Niro is going to make a movie out of a man who has trouble with his temper." And I said, "I know Kalki has had trouble with his temper. I would like very much for Mr. De Niro to meet Kalki." And the next thing I know Max really metamorphoses to this haughty, the chin came up, he really looks different, the whole visage is different, the muscles. I said, "Kalki, this is Mr. De Niro. Mr. De Niro, this is Kalki." And Kalki says, "Oh! You were so good in Taxi Driver." Tell me what has happened in your case, since... No, nothing's happened. It will take a long time. I do not care what happens. I wish they had the death penalty. I wish they had the death penalty, I would happily have it. Since... - Why? - Because when... I will tell you why, because... When a dog goes mad you shoot it, don't you? And a person's worth more than a dog. And if, and if... If you are that kind to a dog, why not be that kind to a human being and just shoot him or something? Max had some good lawyers who cared about him and they asked me if I would write a note saying that he was no longer dangerous and that he should be discharged. And I said no. He had twice, in his altered states, tried to kill, and I had no reason to believe that he wouldn't do it again. And, even though we had a lovely relationship, you know, I've seen enough to know that people can turn on a dime. They were very, very angry at me, but they found another psychiatrist who was willing to write a note, and he was discharged. I think Max never really forgave me. Where is Dad? Where is he? And a professor. - Here's Dad. - Is this Dad? I like that Royal Army Medical Corps, huh? - I love all three. - Yeah, I think the design is so nice. Beautifully done. It says, "Scholar, editor, teacher..." I forgot that we put that. Yeah you left out, you know, husband, father... - Cool dude. - Funny guy. We, I bought four places. So would you, now, which one of you wants to be where... I wanna be there. - I think we have that. - Yeah, you have to be next to Dad. And then the one back there and one back there. Yeah. - That works. - This is the weirdest conversation. I first met Mel in medical school at Yale. I was a student and he was an assistant professor in psychiatry. I bumped into him in the Medical School Library. That night I got a call. He asked me out. And I remember sitting in my chair and it spun, and just spinning around and going "Weeee!" I knew in a week, I really, really liked this person, and I didn't forgive Mel because it took him two weeks to ask me to marry him. You know he was a lot older than I. And so, I spent a fair amount of time when he was going off to meetings and things like that, I was back here. When we were little Mom brought us to our music lessons, and we'd do art projects with her. Whereas my Father, I remember climbing over him and wrestling in the living room, or stuff like that. They were two very complementary forms of bringing up a kid. My father was the very playful one, while, and my Mom was kind of the inspirational one. My career took off in a way I hadn't planned it. My work on juveniles condemned to death was cited in several Supreme Court decisions. But, success did affect my family. I made some teaching tapes of Arthur Shawcross, and some of the things that he went through... She squeezed my thingy. ...were terribly unsettling to my kids. Now they're kind of interested in it. My mom does her writing by hand and then I type up what she's given me. I'm like a fast hunt and peck type typist so, it could be worse. - Hey, Mom! I'm done. - It's beautiful, Eric. Thanks, Mom, but read it over 'cause I thought I made a few mistakes. I love you. I love you. Oh, thank you so much. You're so welcome. I'll be back soon. Yeah, okay. - Alright, I love you, Ma. - I love you. - Uber carefully. - I will. I will never forget that moment, or never forget that day. The loss, the tragedy. He strangled, raped, and murdered her. The guy oughta just be killed. Johnny Frank Garrett had climbed into the window of a convent, and he had gotten into the room of a nun. He left all the fingerprints, he left the knives. This was not a genius we were dealing with, an archcriminal, uh-uh. It was not always easy to understand Johnny Garrett. He was forever changing. Shortly after confessing, he insisted that he had nothing to do with the murder. Hence, he refused to sign the confession he had just provided. To the trial court, he was a liar, pure and simple. Johnny Frank Garrett, thief, rapist, murderer, liar, was not crazy, he was bad. Johnny was dispatched to death row in Huntsville to await execution. We were doing a study of fourteen juveniles under the age of eighteen who were sentenced to death. Johnny related in a bizarre fashion and he talked to voices, he clearly was hallucinating. We wrote reports on everybody we saw and sent them to lawyers. But this one I was more detailed about, because at that point he was the sickest of the death row people I had ever seen. I'd never seen somebody so flamboyantly psychotic. I diagnosed schizophrenia, with brain damage and a history of seizures. But then, I saw a video. 48 Hours interviewed him. You're saying you didn't commit the murder? No I didn't. I didn't commit neither one of them, rape or murder. The hell would I go on and do something like that for? Johnny Garrett claims he talks to his dead Aunt Barbara... Sometimes she'll answer, sometimes she won't. ...who he says often appears in his death row cell. What does she tell you? That they're not going to kill me. That they can't kill me. Immediately, I realized he's a Multiple. And that's all she'll say, is they cannot kill me. Years later, I was reading The Times. 'Pope asks for clemency for death row inmate Johnny Frank Garrett'. And I couldn't believe it. Ann Richards, the Governor of Texas, found herself in a quandary. According to the material she had read, the condemned was obviously demented. Texas was about to execute a crazy man for an act committed as a crazy boy. If there was ever a case deserving of clemency, this was it. On the other hand, Texas was still the no-nonsense state. In fact, Texas was running neck and neck with Florida for the distinction of executing the greatest number of criminals since the death penalty was reinstituted in 1976. No governor of Texas who granted clemency, outright, could rely on reelection. The Texas Governor would convene a clemency board. It would act as another jury. If, after pondering all the evidence, it voted to spare the prisoner, so be it. Nobody could then accuse this governor of being soft on crime. Who was the political pawn whose life hung in the balance? Johnny Frank Garrett. He was coming up for a clemency trial... See, you can see a light in here, and you can see if its playing. So I found out who his lawyer was and called her. And I said, "I goofed, I made a mistake. I will come down to Texas, no fee, no charge, nothing. It's pretty clear that he dissociates." He had a persona, a violent one, Aaron Shockman. How long have you known Aaron Shockman? Well, about... I guess I had to be in fifth grade 'cause I met him... Well, I didn't meet him... - How did you meet him first? - I got beat up. And what happened when you got beat up? I became Aaron Shockman. At that time? And what did you do? - Well, he, he beat them up. - Really? He's older than me, mentally. - He's older than you? - Intellectually. He's smarter than I am. He would pause between what he was telling me and his eyes would kind of go up. And you see that often with people who are talking to someone in their head. Aaron, I need to talk to you now. Have you been listening? - Who am I? - Dr. Lewis. That's right. What made you come? He needed a friend. So he made one. He needed someone to take pain. He needed someone to take pain? And could you do it? Oh yes. He was being fucked. - Who was fucking him? - Everybody. - Who? - His Father. Yeah, and who else? Other men that he met through him, boys, a dog. Why the dog and the boys? Tell me about that. - What was going on? What? - We were being filmed. I'd once heard a lecture by an FBI agent. He talked about how children used in pornography feared for the rest of their lives that their identities, and the perverted acts they were once forced to perform, will someday come to light. Johnny was more terrified of being recognized in the pornographic films he had made as a child, than he was of his impending execution. When he doesn't want to remember, he gives me the memories. Aaron was talking with me, again, Johnny's eyes kind of looked up and I said, "What's happening?" Is someone talking to you now? Who's talking to you, Aaron? - What's going... What's happening? - That bitch. Aaron said, "That bitch Barbara, she wants to get rid of me." - Aunt Barbara? - Yeah, there was Aunt Barbara. She was another alter of Johnny's and she was nearsighted. I can't see. - What? - I can't see you. - What do you mean you can't see me? - You're blurred. - And what's your name? - Barbara. A condemned person must understand the nature of the crime for which he is being executed. He must also understand the fact that he is about to die for it. In Johnny's case, Aunt Barbara had promised repeatedly that Johnny would not die. I'm not gonna let that happen to him. - What do you mean? - I'm gonna stop it. How could you do that? They will kill me, not him. Really? They would kill you, and then what would happen with him? He would still be alive. I testified the following day. We had reams of data about his intelligence, his mental condition. This is how you create a psychotic individual. And we had clips of him in some of these states. When he doesn't want to remember, he gives me the memories. But the clemency board didn't give a damn. Board members came out to vote 17-to-1, to carry out the execution. Garrett's only real hope now is a personal pardon from the Governor. That's unlikely and he faces death by lethal injection. The poison will kill me, and he will live and they will bring... They will have to give him a life sentence. They will have to either give him... They would have to maybe even release him. To no one's surprise, Aunt Barbara's plan did not come off and the poison flowed into Johnny's veins. Witness accounts of the execution led me to believe that, before the poison was injected, it was Aaron, someone far tougher than Johnny, who came to help him through his final ordeal. His last words were something like, "I'm sorry to my Mother, sorry to the family of the nun, and the rest of you can go fuck yourselves." And I thought, "Way to go." Na-na-na-na, hey-hey-hey goodbye! To this group of mostly college students, Johnny Frank Garrett represented all that's wrong with our legal system. With chants and candles, they applauded Garrett's death by lethal injection, saying the punishment must fit the crime. Texas! You know, the row has got to go! On the same side of the street but with an opposite view, were members of Amnesty International. The human rights group argued that by executing a mentally unstable convict, a greater crime was committed. These hardened criminals will never again murder, rape, or deal drugs. As Governor I made sure they received the ultimate punishment: death. And Texas is a safer place for it. Back when we were doing a lot of this work, the tenor of our culture at that time was really crime-and-punishment, and not rehabilitation. They are not just gangs of kids anymore, they are often the kinds of kids that are called super-predators. No conscious, no empathy. I don't wanna ask, "What made them do this?" They must be taken off the street. She's the only Democrat for governor for the death penalty. She's Dianne Feinstein. When Dorothy and I first started working together, and we were seeing our juveniles that were growing up. So these were kids that she had seen at fourteen, I saw them when they were in their twenties. And, initially the state prisons had a rehabilitative model. So they were teaching people how to read, write, balance a checkbook, get a job, write a resume. And then as we were getting more and more into the work we were doing, the culture was changing, and the politicians were getting the message that crime and punishment is what's important. We don't want to rehabilitate, it's too expensive and who cares anyway. If you come into our state and you kill one of our children, you kill a police officer, you're involved with another crime and you kill one of our citizens, you will face the ultimate justice in the state of Texas. And that is, you will be executed. What do you make of... The rationales for the death penalty have always been retribution and deterrence: keeping other people from engaging in the same behavior. And all the studies, social science studies have shown that there is no deterrent effect from executions. In fact, executions sort of bring the act of killing into the mainstream as acceptable. In states where executions have gone up, homicide rates have often gone up. The legal system, at this point, is most interested in incapacitating these people. And you can't really blame them for that. Their interest is in the public safety. But if you have that and only that, and you don't try to figure out what it is that creates these very dangerous people, then you just run the risk of making more and more and more prisons and never preventing. Ever since 1976 juries have been obliged to consider the mitigating as well as the aggravating circumstances of a murder. Aggravating circumstances focused, for the most part, on the grotesqueness of the crimes. Was the victim tortured or raped or mutilated? Was there more than one victim? Then there are the mitigating circumstances. These often focus on the defendant's abusive childhood and on the issues of mental health. Herein lies the contradiction: the gruesomeness of the murder is directly proportional to the craziness of the murderer. Now ask a jury to wrestle with that equation and come up with an answer. It can't be done. The Supreme Court has always used that word "compassion" in describing what's important about mitigation, that it's something that allows a compassionate impulse to work in jurors. You know, my hope and others', our hope in our community was that it would expand to a view that serious mental illness would exempt people from even being sentenced to death to start with. And it hasn't, hasn't moved that direction. Are the courts becoming more receptive? Are juries becoming more receptive to this? No. This is Yale psychiatrist, Dorothy Lewis, and her partner neurologist Jonathan Pincus of Georgetown University. They're trying to get courts to give Multiple Personality different treatment under the law. Which brings us to David Wilson, convicted of murdering a stranger who stopped to help when he thought Wilson's car was broken down on the highway. He was shot point blank with a twelve gauge shotgun. His wallet was still in his glove box. A savage act. What can you say after something so shocking happens? David went into some kind of state, and he mistook the guy who had stopped to help him for somebody dangerous, somebody in his life, and shot him and killed him. Personally, I remember being in the car, but in the back seat sleeping. I didn't know anybody got killed. Working? I went and examined him after he was found guilty and sentenced to death. I was quite startled when I saw he had scars all over his chest and all over his back, and there was a burn scar. - His mother burnt him. - How? - Scarred the shit outta him. - How'd she do that? Boiling water. He run out of the house. He couldn't get it. He was in pain. He had an alter named Juan. Well first I want to know your name. I don't know who I'm talking to. - I'm Juan. - Juan? Who was I just talking to a few minutes ago? - Lee. - Lee? And then he had another alter. I think there were three of them. - In the house... - Tell us who you are. His mother burned him, set him on fire with newspaper. - Tell me your name. - Bobby. - Who are you? - Are you David? You'll know in due time. I'll know in due time. Well, you sound pretty scary. I protect somebody. How do you protect him? What do you do for him? - I hurt anyone that hurts him. - You do? You ask a lot of questions for a doctor. I do. That's the kind of doctor I am. But I'm on David's side. David ain't never had no friends, nobody but me. I'm the only one that ever cared. David's father used to hang David up by his stomach with his trousers off. He had these... - Like balls. - Yes. He put them in my butt, push them in, and kick me in the stomach and they would fly out. Hurt. Hurt bad. - I'm sorry. I can't do this no more. - Who are you now? - I'm David. - You're David? Who am I supposed to be? David, do you remember what you were crying about? Just a lot of pain, and I don't wanna go through this no more. - Do you remember what it was? - No. You don't remember what it was? What is, to you, the most telling thing that convinces you? It's a constellation of things... And you've documented this independently. Oh yes. - It's not just his word? - No, absolutely. Because, again, people sitting at home would say he's got a lot to gain here. What? What does he have to gain? Getting hospitalized instead of jailed. But he doesn't want that. I had a different impression from yours which was that he really did not want us to see these switches, and indeed he doesn't really believe that they occur. David touched me. There was something about him that was so vulnerable and, and so innocent. There's a part that was... I got called to testify at the appeal and David was there. I was explaining his dissociative states and I stopped myself and I said, "Your Honor, may I interrupt for a moment because David is not here right now, but Juan has come. " He switched. It was after that hearing that the judge reduced the sentence to life. - Do you remember me? - Yes. - Yeah? What's my name? - Dorothy Lewis. That's right. No civilized nation throughout history has executed its insane. So from a moral point of view, you don't kill people who, because of an illness, act in an uncontrollable way. But does this really mitigate the horrible crime he committed? He should be punished and punished severely. But should he be put to death for that if the main operative factors in producing his violence were completely out of his control? Under the law, he is still competent enough to know right from wrong. The issue is really whether the individual has that degree of control to conform his behavior to the requirements of law. My daughter believes that the judge who sentences a person to death should be responsible for carrying out his sentence. He should spring the trap door under the gallows, press the button to deliver the current, inject the poison. She thinks then there would be fewer executions. Most people, she believes, would have trouble doing those things. I'm not so sure. Do you wonder what it is like to witness an electrocution? Insert twenty-five cents then quickly pull the control handles to administer capital punishment. My question is, within our own society, are there individuals who are able to kill repeatedly and whose only psychopathology, if you could call it that, is a lack of empathy for other human beings. Are there real sociopaths? The man on the left has killed almost twenty men in Louisiana since December 1983. He is sought after by the authorities but only when it is time to kill again. Sam Jones is an executioner. How many people do you think you've executed? I don't know the exact numbers, 18 to 19, I'm not sure. I lose track. Sam usually works out of the Death House at the Angola State Prison in Louisiana, but today he is some one thousand one hundred and forty-eight miles away up in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania where he's working at his other job as a licensed electrician. He was a traveling executioner, so he would go wherever the execution needed to be. People Magazine had found this guy and I think he was probably advertising his services pretty widely. Warden, this is Sam Jones. I was checking to see if I had any dates coming up. He executed some of my clients. He lived in a trailer park in Louisiana. Cathy and I go down and we meet this guy. I think I had said to you before, not too many people have made me frightened. He did. Sam came with I think a six-pack, and he opened for me and for him and we started talking. Are you ready? The first time that you did an execution, what was it like? I was nervous, didn't know what would happen. - Yes. What did you do? - Didn't know what to expect. But other than that, no. Once I did that I knew it was over with. Why worry so much about why, what is so humane for this person, when they had no worries about the humane way they executed, the way they murdered, mutilated their victims. He had no insight into what this was doing to him. He... How do you feel about executing kids? I don't feel a damn thing about it. - You don't think it matters at all? - How many people you think he killed? Now I had met someone who told me he had no qualms about killing anyone: man, woman, or child. I have never executed no one that was retarded. I don't care what they say in the news media. Would you? If they was, if it come down to it, yes, I would do it. Was Sam Jones the character I had been seeking for years? The cool, premeditated killer without a trace of psychosis or brain damage? I did all the stuff that I do with my murderers. Let me ask you something else. What are your moods like? Has anyone in the family had psychiatric problems? How were you disciplined? What uh... I knew what I could get away with and what I couldn't. I could get away with a lot more, I could, with my mother than I could with my pa. Yeah, like what? Old man tell us Monday morning he was going to whip us Friday, we knew we was getting a whipping Friday. I'd rather it be him that whip me than Mama. - Why? - Mama didn't know when to quit. Has anyone else injured you? Oh god, I don't know. You know men get to drinking, I work construction. - You get in bar rooms... -Do you have any scars? This is scar, that's from a twenty-two magnum. Went through there and... The first one went through here and I caught the barrel on the second time. I beg your pardon. Someone was after you? I just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, that's all we can say about that. A bar? Or what? No, no I was stabbed in the back at a bar and had my lungs collapse. I'm gonna tell you right now, when I go visit people I will not let their children sit in my lap. - Why is that? - Why? 'Cause I don't want some crazy broad saying, "Ew, he molested her!" Sam was as confused and muddleheaded, as battered and beaten, as the violent men I had interviewed on death row. And by his own admission he had a violent past. His serial executions were but the latest manifestations of his paranoid rage. He had served time only for assault and battery, not for murder. But that seemed more the luck of the draw than a reflection of mental health. By his nineteenth execution he had had a lot of experience. I suspect each press of the button further inured him, making it easier and easier over time to do his job. No, I don't see no nightmares. I sleep good at night. No ghosts and goblins coming after me. When he was really talking about himself and really getting into his philosophy on executions and he's just doing a job, he told us that... I paint a painting after each execution. Acrylic. Acrylic? Is that the only time you paint? Yeah, that's about it. The only time is after you each execution. What are you feeling when you are doing it? It's hard to say. I'm feeling nothing. He would blank out and he would do a piece of artwork. The pictures got more and more bizarre, more and more psychotic, and more and more violent. Just paint on canvas. To me they're just paint on canvas. There you saw the real person who had this façade that he was a cool guy cause he was doing this terrifying work, that should upset anybody. Although he was very cool about, no big deal, his paintings showed his humanity. You could see the upset. There's no reason in normal life for me to go out there and kill him, her, her, or you. Why should I walk in a convenience store because some poor girl, or some young man is trying to work their way through college, no matter what their race is and go in and kill them over twenty-five or fifty dollars? There's no reason I can comprehend that. Now taking that low-life son of a bitch, putting him in a chair and zapping him, that I can understand. - That doesn't bother you? - No. It's puzzling. It's, you know, you certainly wonder, was, did he dissociate? Or did he think killing is different from executing? No, my kid's for it, my grandchild's for it. Your grandchild? How old is your grandchild? He knows about it. He's four or five. - How does he know? - He tells me to, "Zap 'em, Grandpa." There's mold on these things. Oh for god's sake. Hey, Er! Eric? Eric, guess what I found! "1/23/89. Tape 2." You know what that is? Yeah, I wouldn't even put Bundy's name on it 'cause I thought in case anyone got a hold of these, I didn't want them to know what it was. That's my last interview with him. Take a look. Don't get DNA on it! It is now thirty years since Theodore Bundy, arguably the most notorious American serial murderer of the twentieth century, was electrocuted. Bye bye, Ted Bundy, goodbye. For readers unfamiliar with this case, Theodore Bundy was a young male, sexual predator who terrorized the United States from coast to coast during the 1970s. He committed over thirty homicides of young women, decapitating some and saving their skulls as trophies. Attractive, articulate, and charismatic, he convinced the court to allow him to represent himself, turning his trials more into performance pieces than serious legal proceedings. After numerous unsuccessful appeals, Bundy was executed in Starke, Florida on January 24th, 1989. Why write about Bundy decades after his death? Hasn't everything of importance already been said? No. The authors resurrect this case to call into question the widely held belief that Bundy had a normal childhood and that he simply had an innate predisposition to extreme violence. That he was simply born evil. Bundy himself perpetuated the fantasy that he came from this perfectly normal childhood, and so he must be evil. Because, I grew up in a wonderful home with two dedicated and loving parents, one of five brothers and sisters. That's fodder for us to say now, wait a minute. We know that people are not born evil, that has to develop somehow. I hope no one will try to take the easy way out and try to blame, or otherwise accuse my family of contributing to this because... So I'm interested, in particular why you, you're so interested in him, even today. Well, uh, first of all, 'cause I got it wrong. In 86' Bundy's attorneys asked, "Would you work with the defense team," because they were appealing. And I said, "Sure." We had our psychologist, our neurologist, our neuropsychologist and did a computerized EEG. We did not find any gross neurological problems, but we did find some abnormalities that are often seen in depressed people. Bundy had already been evaluated by several other professionals. They diagnosed psychopathy, they said he was just a psychopath. - Did you ever see the Dobson tapes? - Yes. You know, you know. Ted, how did it happen? Take me back. What are the antecedents of the behavior? The basic humanity and the basic spirit that God gave me was intact, but unfortunately it became overwhelmed, at times, through the kind of fantasy life that was fueled largely by pornography. Do you realize how many serial killers you would have out there if pornography could do that? It's so simple-minded. I think it's clear that sexual sadists like Ted Bundy are very much interested in pornography. Research I've recently done with Roy Hazelwood of the FBI indicated that more than fifty percent of sexually sadistic offenders like Bundy had sizable pornography collections. Would curbing pornography make our society any safer? It would do more good than banning assault rifles would do. What kinds of materials are perhaps more harmful? Well number one on my list, as of 1986, was the covers of detective magazines. Bundy's grandfather had a real collection of pornography that he was exposed to very young. Pulp fiction, sex, and murder and stuff like that. And he would fantasize about these sexual murderous kinds of things and he said it would build and build and then it had to be released. Those of us who have been so much influenced by pornographic violence, are not some kind of inherent monsters. We are your sons and we are your husbands. We grew up in regular families, and pornography can reach out and snatch a kid out of any house today. You know, clearly it had some influence on him, but I think there were other explanations. And, so I interviewed family members: his aunts, an uncle, his mother. I learned that his grandmother suffered from a depressive disorder. She was psychiatrically hospitalized and treated with electroconvulsive therapy. I was talking to Aunt Julia and I said, "What was he like as a little boy?" And she said, "Well, when he was three years old he used to come up with kitchen knives and he'd stand at the door, then he'd come in. He picked up the blanket and he put the knives around her on the bed. And he had that glint in his eye." This was the first, the very, very first time that we realized how aberrant he had been. I was so stunned. Convicted murderer, Theodore Bundy, is taking new steps to avoid Florida's electric chair. Armed guards brought Bundy to the Orlando Federal Building for a hearing to determine his mental competency. When I testified, I had enough data to make a diagnosis of a bipolar disorder. He had episodes of highs where he could keep going and going and going and he was grandiose, but these were interspersed with periods of terrible depression, when he'd drop out of school, he would weep, he would go off by himself. On the stand I said he was not competent either to represent himself or really to go to trial. I'm not going through this, and you knew that, Your Honor! But the judge ruled that he was competent enough and he upheld the death sentence. Salvador Dali was 84. In Florida, a convicted serial killer is continuing his string of eleventh-hour confessions. As NBC's Ed Ravel reports, Ted Bundy is apparently trying to delay his execution scheduled for the electric chair tomorrow. A few years after I first saw him, I got a call from his lawyer saying he wanted to meet with me before he was executed, so I did go. The attorney, she said, "Ted wants to know if you can say that he is incompetent to be executed." And I said, "I would be laughed out of town, I just can't do that." And I said, "And all the work that we've done to understand people who do these kinds of things will not be considered valid if I say something as ridiculous as that." But he clearly knew he was going to be executed. - He knew what an execution meant. - That's right. And he knew what he had done. And I said, "Besides, the Warden has three other psychiatrists out there waiting to refute this. - What was his reaction? - He said he could understand that. He gave me permission to tape the conversation. January 23rd, 1989. I asked him why did he ask to see me. And he said... Dr. Lewis, you're more interested in me, in what was going on in my head and how this developed. I was not fascinated by his perversions. I was far more interested in how he got the way he was. Whatever his motives for asking me to come to Starke, and mine for coming, our four and a half hours together on the day before his execution were riveting. Your sisters, did you ever look at them while they were dressing? Bathing? Since that, you said, was a curiosity you had. In my teens, yeah. Well... This is something I've never told anyone, and I always promised myself I never would. - Should I stop the tape recording? - Well, yeah, yeah but... When the tape recorder was off, Bundy told me that he had a sexual encounter with one of his sisters. Later, his mother told me that he had told his sister that she should be careful because there was someone out in the world who was killing women who looked just like her. Bit by bit, I was beginning to see a very different story in Bundy's family life, one that would upend the myth of pure evil. - Hello, Dr. Lewis. How are you? - Hello! The last interview I did tape, and there was a point in that interview when he said I want you to turn the tape off, only once, and that was when he talked about his relationship with his sister. I didn't talk to him about his sisters. I was basically talking about crimes with him. Really. Did, but, even earlier on he didn't tell you that he had... No I didn't. He was always protective with his family. I mean, he would tell me things that I wouldn't even ask him about. Bill Hagmaier, he was the major FBI agent on the case, he had spent a lot of time with Bundy, much more time than I did. So that's why I wanted to see him. Each of us was close to Bundy in a different kind of capacity. We were the ones that Bundy trusted. I was assigned to the Behavioral Science Unit and they had already started to do some research on murderers and Bundy's name came up. So I wrote him a letter, just general letter and Ted invited me to visit him. Were you able to get Bundy to talk much about his family and his childhood? We talked about it quite a bit. He wasn't telling the truth in all this, I know, everything was cotton candy for him and his family. He didn't want to say anything bad about his family at all, or his mother. Bundy's mother was impregnated by someone, we are not sure who it is. I asked her something about how she felt when she knew she was pregnant, and I don't know if I actually said abortion or if she brought it up. But she said, he, now meaning the father, "He took me to a doctor. The doctor gave me pills for an abortion. But nothing happened and..." So it was an attempted abortion that didn't succeed. Yeah, which is not supposed to be so good for the baby. Her father made arrangements for her to go up to a home for unwed mothers, called the Lund Home. She was at the Lund Home for two months and then gave birth to him. She wouldn't allow her father to come up at all until after the baby was born. And she signed papers saying he could be put up for adoption. And then, her father came up and brought her home, back to Philadelphia. However, for two months he kept saying, "We have to get the baby back, we want the baby back," and finally she gave in. She went and picked the baby up, brought the baby home. And then her father insisted that he be known as the baby's father and that the baby call him Father and that Louise be known as his sister. He was an incredibly violent man and apparently a very, very disturbed man according interviews that I've had with relatives. Your grandfather had an extraordinary temper, a violent temper. That may well be true. The only time I can remember my granddad being angry was one time I left the chicken coop door open, and he got angry and I ran away. The whole family knows the story that in the car, while the grandfather was driving, one of his younger brothers, I believe, said, "Oh, tell us about Ted's real father." And apparently the grandfather was out of his mind filled with rage. He had total control over Bundy's mother, he had total control over how this child was gonna be raised. And the family told Dorothy that they had to help the mother and the child, Ted, escape from the father and go cross-country to get away from him. Things were horrendous for Bundy from conception on. Several years after Bundy was executed, I got a phone call from his wife, and whom I had never spoken to, never heard from before and I think I couldn't even contact her while he was alive, and she said a friend of hers was coming to New York. She was going to give her a packet of love letters that Bundy had written to her. The handwriting was all very much alike, but the signatures were different. See look, this would be an ordinary thing, an ordinary writing, yeah. But here, look at the difference. That is so aberrant and out of control and different. He often signed different names to his letters, but the most important one is that some of them are signed Sam. Oh, look, here is Sam, here is Sam. Here is another Sam. No, it says Sambo, it's a version of Sam. It turns out that Sam was the name of his grandfather. People who are multiples or who have DID, it's very common for them to have an alter who is the abuser. When I saw that, I thought, "How did I so miss this?" We realized that Sam was the grandfather and that he had taken on this persona and... With all the work that we have been doing, there are numerous data that show he is somewhere on the continuum of Dissociative Identity Disorder. When he was going to be sentenced, he said to the judge... I'm not asking for mercy, for I find it somewhat absurd to ask for mercy for something I did not do. And there was one time after he had told me about many of the murders, he came in and he sat down and his demeanor was different. And he said, "The person sitting before you never killed anyone." I don't think that he is kidding or pretending that he's innocent. I think that there is a Bundy state where he did not do any of those murders. In fact, he referred to the person who killed, he called that The Entity. Let's say the late winter, early spring of '69 is where we're starting to see this, this entity begin to reach the point where it was necessary to, I mean, to act out. It takes over the basic, consciousness mechanism and more or less dictates what's going to be done. It was inobtrusive at first. It was something that kind of grew on me that began to visualize and fantasize about more violent things. By the time I realized how powerful it was, it was big trouble. Tell me... I had a clue then, that he might suffer from a Dissociative Disorder. But then when I saw the writing and I saw that he did, at times, seem to become his grandfather, who is a very violent kind of person, that's when I got interested. So yeah, I'm not the first to have wondered whether his grandfather was indeed his father. May I ask you a question? There are a lot of reasons that I think this would, you've heard this also before, other people who have thought that. I've said he's his own father, but he isn't. I think the grandfather may have been... I don't know. I know that was one of the first things that Louise said to me when she met me. She just said, "I just want you to know right now that my father is not his father." I didn't even ask her the question. That is amazing because I did not... A number of people have suspected that there was incest but nobody has ever come out and said that there is incest in the family. If we were to get blood, we could look at the genes in the blood sample, the DNA. We all have a certain number of identical matching genes. But, if you have more than a certain number of identical genes, it is an indication of incest because you have too much from the same family. Basically, what you are getting to, does incest influence serial killer development. I doubt that the FBI lab is going to give out that for that purpose. Not saying it wouldn't help, help us understand behavior in people. But, but it's just, you know... So were you able to get DNA from the FBI? Oh, no. The FBI isn't generous that way. But I was able to get a sample elsewhere, and, according to that report, his grandfather was not his father. He was not the product of incest. Was there some actual disappointment when you discovered that? Oh yes. Oh, yes. And why would it be so important to know whether or not Bundy's grandfather was also his father? I don't think genetically it matters, that I really don't believe. You know, it might, it may be that he had more, a greater likelihood of having a bipolar disorder. But I think that, I think he was treated throughout his lifetime as though he were some kind of child that you don't want to have around. His mother, when I spoke with her, said "I can't wait 'til it's all over." - You mean the execution? - Yeah. I find it hard to interpret it any other way. Yeah. But can you imagine, "I can't wait 'til it's all over." There was the atmosphere of a public hanging as hundreds of singing, chanting death penalty supporters gathered at the Florida State Prison, demanding the execution of serial killer Ted Bundy be carried out. And when the official witnesses came out of the prison, signaling the death of Bundy, there were cheers. You know, it's taken me thirty years to get to this point, but we could have learned a whole lot more from him. If he were not killed, we could have learned a lot about serial murderers but they killed him. They... And we have breaking news today from the Justice Department, a new directive from Attorney General Bill Bar, to reinstate executions of federal death penalty prisoners for the first time in nearly two decades. Attorney General Barr says it's time to restore the death penalty for the sake of victims and their families. He points out that under administrations of both parties, attorneys general have approved seeking the death penalty... When I heard that, I thought that all of the advances that we'd made, in terms of being humane, were lost. Barr, he puzzles me. These five people, if indeed they've done the most grotesque things, we know that the most disturbed, the most psychotic, or the most brain-damaged killers do the most bizarre, grotesque, horrendous kinds of things, so he was picking the sickest of the sick to execute. You know I'm not sure that we've come as far as we think we have. It feels as if all the work that I had done, that Dick Burr had done, that for the moment it had been, it was like flushed down the toilet. As if we'd gone back to, like, the Middle Ages. I remember, one time, someone asked me, "When you see in a movie or read about a witch being burned, are you watching it or are you the witch?" I'm always the witch. I think what a horrible, horrible thing, and picture the flames coming up around me and wondering how someone could do that to someone else. It appalled me and it fascinated me. It reminds me of taking a tour of death row. First, it was the area where the visitors watch, and then they took us around to go right into the execution room. This wooden chair with leather belts. I did picture myself there. Ted Bundy, Johnny Garrett, Marie Moore, Jonathan, me. Could any of us become a murderer? Could anyone in the world become a murderer? I think so. Murderers are made, not born. The more we understand about the genesis of violence the harder it is to draw a line between guilt and innocence, sanity and insanity. As human beings we struggle to cope with the need for protection, the desire for revenge, and decency and morality. But to understand sometimes means to forgive and these days people aren't in a very forgiving mood. Maybe Ted Bundy was right. We are all far more curious about what the murderer did, the gory details of the crime, than about why they did it. It's the act of murder that fascinates us and tickles our own limbic systems. No wonder people fight for seats at executions. Is that, at least in part, why I do the work I do? Maybe. I wouldn't be surprised.
