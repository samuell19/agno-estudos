Well, now, say I was to go for this deal-- and I got to admit my curiosity is up. How much would it cost me? For the week, I mean. You are going to love this. Just $300 for the whole week, maybe a couple extra bucks for some backup boys, but I'’ll scrounge them up myself. 300 plus. Unbelievable, isn'’t it? Mm-hmm. Sort of a coincidence too. Oh, really? Why? Well, that'’s the exact same amount it'’s going to cost to get your brother out of Judge Wintergreen'’s jail. Here'’s for your old strawberry soda. Now hold on there just a minute, little'’un. Don'’t go running off all ruffled up. You get back over here. Why'’d you let me go on like that? I don'’t think it'’s any joke when somebody'’s in trouble. Honey, you was going so fast, I was afraid if I tried to stop you, you'’d have broke your tongue. So...? Well, now, I can'’t rightly go for putting on a show right now. But I was thinking I do need some time off to tend to some other business, and this is a slow time of the year around the club, so I thought maybe he could tend bar for me, give me a little time off.

I think you better. Oh! Oh! Oh. [ chuckles ] [ sighs ] Oh. Uh-uh-uh. Yeah. [ sighs ] What happened to your head? Deputy dented it. Yeah, he should be dragged behind the truck. Mm-hmm. Hey, Conrad, come here. [ groans ] This here'’s my brother, Travis Child, the next Nashville superstar. This is Conrad. He'’s a cop. Hey, Travis. Hey, yourself, Conrad. You know, I was just wondering, what do they do to you around here if you commit a crime? Well, come on, honey. I don'’t know how you got me out, Amanda, but it wasn'’t a minute too soon. Piece of cake, Travis. Well, I ain'’t going back in that jail even if it harelips the Pope.
