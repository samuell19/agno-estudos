I put on my working clothes. I don't need any book. Just a bottle of water. The farmer is already on the field. He is tall and skinny. He has a costume and in his hands... Yes, thank you. Radu, you read. Essay. Picking tomatoes is very fun because we can eat as many as we want. CEAUSESCU SPEAKING STUPID THINGS You can't keep shut miss. You know why I called you.

Yes, I know where, you've called me there before. Dear, why are all of them white? Because they are from Moldova. (North-est part of Romania) Look Mr. Aurel's isn't as white. Yeah, but he is old. Look, a midget! That's more like it. Don't you know little guys have big cocks? Maria, the boss called for you. What the hell does he want? Good day. What were you doing? With the bearings?

Name, Lazlo. And Cherry? That's what my friends call me. So can I call you Cherry. What do you say? No. "Face without a face, forhead of sand." Salutations. Murgu. Quick, we've got work. I understand. Well... "Faceless face, voiceless voice. " What the heck is this? I'm in love with...la la la... bullshit la la la. Here. "Forhead of sand." You mean a head without a mind, no? "voiceless voice." You mean nobody listens to him? Who does nobody listen to? Face without a face, huh? It means he is missing a cheek. Who are you alluding to? Nobody, it's just a song. You don't say. Then why do you sing it if you are alluding to nobody? Because it's a song. Don't play word games with me. Who are you alluding to? Nobody. Don't you know your buddy Stoian spilled everything? He didn't have anything to say. Yeah right. Boy, he won't tell us. He didn't say anything because it's not true. Really? Just write down who you are alluding to, and when we are satisfied, you will leave. Listen, don't write your uncle's name, or I'll fuck your mother's gods. Write. Bye. Bye. Clara. What? I wanna show you something. What's up with you? What happened? First I thought I broke the tail. I didn't want to think of something else. Why the fox? How do they know? Quit thinking. They have nothing to know. Oh well. They know very well And they hit where it hurts. I have this fox since I was 10 years old. I don't know why I wanted a fox. When my mom told me we are going to a nearby village to buy a fox, I couldn't sleep. It was a little before Christmas, that winter it didn't really snow It was more of a thin layer of white powder. In the morning the ground was frozen. But I didn't feel anything, It was as if I was flying. My poor mom could barely keep up with me. We took a break and I stopped at a window. It was the only one without a christmas tree. We passed through a long coridor with walls covered in fox skins. We were going to a room with nothing but a bed and a chair. The hunter came and brought the fox. He said it was the biggest fox he caught. But I wanted to see the gun. And then he said foxes aren't shot, they are caught in traps. So that you don't see a gun wound. I was looking at him and his hair was red. His beard was red. Even the hair on his hands was red. Do you think it was the secret services. Do you think I'm crazy? Can't you see? Sure, but why? It's sinister. And what we are living isn't? Forgive me. I shouldn't have brought you in this story. Let me make you a tea. Did you check if anything is missing? What could be missing? You think they are idiots? Hold this. Ilie is missing a lot of things. Ilie is a man they just wanna scare me. Let's drop it. If you look closely it doesn't look too bad. People are having fun. Life goes on. But I'm afraid nothing will happen. How many times did I tell you that only a miracle can save us? Buddy, I have a theory, the worse it is, the better it is. Listen here, nothing will happen till we hit rock bottom. We've been rummaging rock bottom for years. You are wrong. As long as romanians have what to steal, they will be satisfied. Believe me. C'mon kids, you really think everyone thinks like us? Ask them how they are doing, ask them. And watch everyone of them brag. That's it, he is right. I know he is right but I can't take it anymore. Yesterday an old lady told a young man: If three people can eat, so can five. And he answered: sure, let's hope it won't be worse. So? So don't you feel like strangling... Liviu. Hey, you know this one? Know what? Reagan's bodyguard jumps in the water after a ring. After swimming around he comes back with the ring. Everyone applauds. Old Nicu(Ceausescu) throws a ring in the water with sharks. And signals to his security guy to jump in the water. The Security guy shakes his head no. Ceaucescu frowned. Everyone applauded and admired his courage. The boy was moldovan. Excuse me, I'm moldovan. It was nothing father, cheers. Cheers! Many years ahead! Good health! Good health and many years! Is this military guy your relative? When you wanna party all night, you gotta invite them. There is no other way. It's harder in the countryside, you know? Greetings. Hello. There is a terrible storm outside. Could I possibly stay overnight for 20 years? Yes sir. Take your coat off. Oh, What a beauty we are. You like it? Yes, very much. Come, c'mon. I wanna ask you something. Quick because I wanna go. I have a friend that want to get a divorce. Why doesn't she get one? Because her man doesn't one. And what are we supposed to do about it? She needs a lawyer but she doesn't have money. No money? She is a wretch with two kids. Two kids? I told her I know somebody. Who? Who? You. You can do it, right? I can't. Why? I can't. Why? How do you know I'm a lawyer? You told me. But I'm not a lawyer. I'm from the secret services. Major. What? What? Why are you shut? Say something. Say something! You heard well, what is it? Why are you quiet? Say something. Speak! If you knew you wouldn't have let me touch you, huh? Baldy escaped. You're a pig. Yes. I know. An hour ago I was a man, now I am a pig. And a big one. No problem. You slug, why aren't you focused? Bonsoir. Daddy is home! Good evening. Hi daddy. Hi. What goods have you brought? And why are you so late? Daddy has word to do, dear. How was our essay? Tell me. The teacher asked who helped me. You could've called. On what phone? You think these come on their own to the office? I have to go, work for it... Give it back, what's your problem? It won't make her any smarter. Thanks. What have you heard about my shoes? After Christmas surely I'll have them. You were supposed to get them. I talked to that wise guy director. All you had to do was go, dear. All I did was go, but do you think somebody looked at me? Why? Because the wife of the secretary was there with the manager. And all morning they were were following her ass. She tried on shoes until she got sick. Nothing fit her. At her weight of 100kg, only rubber boots would fit. You will have shoes dear, I will make a note and arrange a meeting. You don't care, who knows when you will arrange a meeting. What do you want dear, you want shoes right now? Now, you want them now? I can't eat because you have no shoes, right? Can I eat in peace? Now we want peace. You're either gone or you want peace. Go to the table. Leave me alone. Come to the table now. I cook all day like a cow so you can mock me and my food? Leave me alone, go to... Leave me alone, go do your stuff. Leave the tv... Are you tired from chasing sluts? Are you crazy with lies? Go to hell and leave me alone. Here smell it, smell it! Smell this, smell it. Is it my perfume? What do you want? You f*cking fornicator. Smell, Smell, Smell. Bloody histerical woman. Good day. Good day. Who are you looking for? Comrade Pavel Murgu. Is he waiting for you? Yes. Who should I say is looking for him? Millin. Comrade major, comrade Milin is here for you sir. Yes, sir. Can you give me a cigarette? Here. One for the soul and one for the heart. You can walk around. Tell him I will be at the cafe bar nearby. Sure. Good day. Hello. What do you care, it's warm, eh? Eat Johnny, but don't go. We got work to do. Sit, sit, sit. And you, nothing. Greetings Mitzi. Ah, Vasile the great. Cheers. How's life going? Can you buy us a drink sir? Mitzi, give the boys what they like. To life. What are pleasure. I'm happy to see you, but I'm afraid this is the wrong place. They will think you're something else. And where was I to find you? You didn't leave a phone number, nothing. The only... Yes Mitzi. And for you? Miss? Nothing. Two instant coffees. Sure. The only thing I know about you is this. The bad part is here we can't really talk. Cheers. I understand I have to go. Not so quick, dear. Pretend you came in to communicate something... Cheers. You know. You mean like a spy? Yeah something like that. Then I will communicate I'm pregnant. Greetings. Mrs. Mitzi was a great singer. A great man, a great man I tell you. There are few people with a heart as good as comrade major. Do you have a good cigarette? What's with you, something happened? All kinds of things are happening. Exactly nothing is happening, we are just tricking ourselves. oh well. C'mon now. I have a feeling we are living corpses. What brings you here? In fact I saw Clara this morning at the gynecologist. As you can see I came straight to an oncologist. Give me a medical leave. Your lucky I'm alive. I have to see Ilie. I didn't ask for what. How long? Three days. That's only the road there and back. When are you going? Tomorrow morning. It will be good for Ilie. Good day! I want an apple! Go to sleep! C'mon give the boy an apple! Is it good? It's cold. Don't mind if I ask, who you are going to? To a soldier. And what is the name of this soldier of yours? Dolga. Dolga who? Ilie. Now I get why he doesn't like it here with us... "Last Night of Love, First Night of War", is it nice? Depends. Private Dolga! Yes sir! You have a visit! Thank you! Hey! Are you ok? Yeah. When did you leave? At 5. It?s kinda hard to get here. The train ride was worse. My brain was freezing. Yeah, winter has come. When we go out with the tanks we freeze like turds. What's this? What you asked for. True Out here you can?t tell yesterday from today. You go nuts. This week we were with the tanks out in the field. What field? It all looks like empty space. Field ? field. Here everywhere is the field. Beyond the forest is a hill. When we went up with the tank we had to get out and put rocks behind the tracks. When we went down the hill we had to put rocks in front on the trucks. Finally it stopped. We all fell to the ground and we didn?t move till evening. The tank is still out on the field. If the Russians waited for Ceaucescu?s tanks, they wouldn?t have made it to Prague. And you? What are you up to? Nothing. The usual. I couldn?t wait to see you but all of a sudden in the train I got scared. I fell asleep and dreamed a fox that was walking in a big tilled field. The fox was walking and eating fresh dirt. You haven?t had a dream in a long time. You are still scared. To me it?s all the same. I don?t think of anything. Not even me... Let?s go outside This speaker is driving me crazy. I kept on thinking if I should tell you. Now I?m on ?their" radar. I don?t know what to do. They are cutting my fox to pieces. When I escape from here I?ll run away. Are you crazy? They will shoot you! You'll come with me! Do you wanna wait for them to cut the whole fox? And what do you wanna do? Go to Vienna and sweep the streets? If I have to I?ll do it. Ilie, don?t you understand there is no good place for us? You'll come with me! No alcohol before 10. Excuse me? No alcohol before 10! But I wanna drink now. Eh, many want to but they can?t. What to do... I can?t have one? No no. What?s with you? Something wrong? Take your coat off. Want a coffee, hm? No, I wanna drink. A Schnaps? Can I stay? No problem. I was just about to go; Ana is going too. You will stay by yourself in the whole house. Better take the key and lock me in. What is it dear, what?s gotten in to you? Can?t you see it?s morning? What do you want me to kick her out? Let?s go. I can?t look at the water; It makes me sick. Good thing you didn?t puke. I only puked once. Good evening. Paul saw you at the clinic. Yes, I was pregnant. And you officially scraped it out at the clinic? Pavel knows a doctor. Is this Pavel a doctor himself? No, he is a lawyer. Why didn?t you tell me anything? Because he is married. And since when is that a reason? Why are you hiding him from me? Because he is married. Swear it? I identified the guy that hooked up with Clara. He is not a lawyer. I asked someone to look him up in the court records. No trace of Pavel Murgu. There is a Adriana Murgu. But Cherry knows someone... that had an interesting conversation with him. Does he have gray hair and a big mole here? No, I don?t know him. Better, I wouldn?t want you to. This Murgu guy... is a Security man. He interrogated Cherry. He knows the song Face Without a Face by heart, and he wanted to know what we are alluding to. What are we alluding to? I see you are in a hurry. Here you go! You first! I like you! I understand. Do you mind? There are plenty of benches. I wanna sit here. I?ve been watching you for a while. I?ve been wanting to f*ck you for a while now. Surely you f*ck well. What? Go away! You don?t think I can f*ck you? Oh, then I will just say goodbye. Wait a second, I?m changing the gear. Hey, is this what we agreed to? Here, take 100... and get your ass here. Lights! They stole the lights, they cut the light, they took our bulbs. Was that Pavel? What are you talking about? You know this guy is in the secret police? Why don?t you say anything? Why are you mute? Huh? Relax, wait I will tell you. Tell me what? What else is there to say? You know I wouldn?t do you any harm, he wouldn?t either. I know him he is a good man. He promised not to hurt you. I told him I will stay with him if nothing happens to you. Aaa, so you will stay with him only if nothing happens to me. Like a sacrifice for me, right? Aren't you ashamed of yourself? And the fox!? Maybe he will tell you why it?s cut up! And the others? Your man protected them until they died! And you sleep around with him! What am I supposed to do, I love him! You cow! You don?t even... You don?t even know him. I don?t wanna know him or you! Romania! Romania! Romania! Romania! Romania! Romania! Irina, I know you're home! Open please! Stop the nonsense, Irina! It is something serious. Gico! Open the f*cking door you bloody whore! You wicked man! You?re drunk again like a pig. What the hell do you want me to do? Irina, they are arresting people, they have a list. Please come with me. Cut the crap. - Clara Listen up, nobody leaves or enters or you?re in big trouble. Listen! bring this file quick... Give it! Thanks. But where? To reanimation. Now you are free for good. Watch out for wise guys, so they don?t f*ck up our spiel; Like Dr. Stoian. Bring the patients. Put everyone in their rooms and let them stare! You?ll find me at Stanculescu. Got it boss. Check your gadgets. Be good! Don?t pull! Don?t pull! Be good! Don?t pull! Don?t pull! Sit! We are going to Liviu. Adi, you have to hide. They have lists! I?ll stay. They have no problems with me. Can?t you see it?s not a joke? In the end the devil will still get ?em. Or us. I gotta go. Wait I?m heading out too. And see what?s the matter with Cherry. Give me that please. What do you have there? Present your identification! Yes! Liviu! Who is it? Who is it? Yes, cousin, yes! Hurry up and open the door! Speak of the wolf and he is at the door! You went to bed at the same time with the chickens, huh? Greetings! Welcome! Hello cousin! Just last night we were talking about you. You hardly come around here. It is what it is. Let?s go to the kitchen, here is the freezer. You came with the car? Let me open the gate and let you in. It?s better that way. I?m leaving in the morning with the first ride. Take care of Irina. Cousin, you know what?s best! Stay calm, leave Irina here. Now let?s eat. Don?t turn on the lights before pulling the blinds. It would be wise not to be in the yard during the day. It would be wise not to be in the yard during the day. No thank you, I have my own. Then good night! God I?m exhausted! The pot! And don?t forget to put some wood on the fire later. Good night! Don?t forget to wake me up in the morning. Ok? I will. Good night! What?s up with them? What do you mean? Nothing. They seem to have problems. When you went to the car, Irina barely said a word. They have to stay a couple of days. But why, what happened? What happened? It?s crazy in Timisoara. They are being chased. And what if they were seen entering our house? Who saw them at night? I just don?t want us to get in trouble. Now that you were voted to be secretary of the party. What do you want Doina? He is my cousin. What should I do? Forgive me, but I have to do it. I?ve been holding it for a while. The worst thing is the sound. Should I whistle? My old man always whistled when the horses peed. Dumbass. Greetings! Hi! Where is Paul, did he go? No, he is sleeping. Things are really bad in Timisoara; don?t let him go. I have to go to school I have a few more classes. Good bye! Why didn?t you wake me up? I should?ve been gone by now. Paul, it?s too risky to leave. Liviu came and said it?s havoc in Timisoara. Radio: ...more than yesterday, the whole population of Timisoara knew something was going to happen. On the side of the road people are clapping with tears in their eyes. How great it is to live times like this! I never thought I?d see something like this. Stop! Where are you going? Are you crazy? Run me over if you wanna go! Run me over! I?m not moving, I?m not moving! Where are you going? Move outta the way! I ain?t moving! What don?t you understand? Are you crazy? You want them to shoot you? Move out of the way! I?m not moving! Hit me, c?mon hit me! Get outta here! I?m not moving! You are not going anywhere! Why didn?t you let them go? Why did you interfere? Nothing will happen to them. They know many people... Paul is a doctor. What about us? Ever since the fox thing my nails are growing faster. You are laughing as a fool. Fine, no more laughing. I saw it in school. The poor kids... Nails and hair grew faster, than the other kids. When you live in fear, your hair and nails grow faster. CEAUSESCU: In this afternoon, I want to address to the whole people of our socialist motherland regarding the events that are taking place. I told you we won?t get rid of him. Y?all said he will stay in Iran. Look at him. He will bury us all, listen to me. Liviu! What is it!? Come over here. Now? Yeah, bring me some wood. These were acts of terrorism; organized and started by imperialist reactionary groups, and foreign spies from various countries. Cousin, I think it?s best we mind our own business. What do you want to do? Can?t you see and hear? Maybe you think I?m opportunistic. Maybe I am But would you be here? It is clear the events of this campaign against Romania is part of a bigger more general plan against the independence and sovereignty of nations. Irina, I?m scared. What is gonna happen with us now? Here everyone knows everything about the neighbors. Leave me alone! If we stay here any longer, you?ll become a real housewife! Leave me alone. Paul, stop! You have regrets? Can you leave me alone? Are you sick of me? Or scared of me? Paul stop! Maybe you?ll never see him again. Shut up! Or maybe we are gonna have to escape and cross the border. Maybe they aren?t even looking for us. Shut the f...! Irina, wait! Leave me alone! Wait I said! I wanna go now. Go where? Are you crazy? You want to get killed? I want to go there. Where, you idiot? Where? He left; he ran away!

Anything good? My wife is sick in bed. I have to go. I wish her good health. Good bye! C?mon where the hell were you. You were supposed to be here by now. Give me a break. Can?t you see they are shooting? Adi doesn?t know anything either. I don?t know what the hell is going on. Lots of crazy shit. Some are saying the water supply has been poisoned by Ceausescu?s hired Arabs, I dunno. I don?t know any prayers granny, And it?s a little too late to learn. Could you dissect these bodies? It would be worse than If I dissected my parents. How could you say that? I know it?s not the same thing, but... TV: Ceausescu Elena, sentenced to death and confiscated her wealth. I don?t know, but when I look at them, I don?t see a body. The sentence was executed. Their hearts are now cemeteries. full of dead people Like tiny frozen raspberries. I?m appalled, and I pity them Where does all this pity come from; after all we?ve been through? Don?t burn the frames children. Yeah, you?re right. Maybe we will use it for another leader. I?ve been waiting for this moment! I couldn?t tell. What was I to do? I have a child. I know, men have wives, women have kids, and kids are hungry. Good thing it?s over. It?s over... But I'm afraid our life is kinda f*cked. What?s with you? I wanted to see you. I kept thinking about you. I was afraid you were gonna get hurt or something. Didn?t your man promise nothing will happen to me? Where is he now? He left you? No He ran away. Of course Just like a rat. He could?ve told you what happened to Cherry Or what is left of him. He didn?t shoot, Irina. He promised me he didn?t. Wicked people swear. Is there someone to prove he shot? Nobody shot. He told me he only fired in the air. And the air was in the lungs. Go see his big beautiful picture wanted picture. Where did he run? To Vienna. They will find him. They will find him. But what do want? Think about me too. You know what Clara? On that day you told me you thought about me, it was your birthday I wanted to give you something and I realized I have nothing else to give to. This is it. Cheers! Good thing we are free! God bless! It?s strong! From my father. Mommy, look a cat! That?s not a cat, it?s a fox. What is it? They are doing it again. They cut the fox?s head. Damn them! How is Cherry now? Up there on his belly looking down on us. What do you have against us, God?
