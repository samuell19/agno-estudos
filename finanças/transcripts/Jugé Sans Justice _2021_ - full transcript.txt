What's your name? You can't stay here. You'll catch a cold. Come with me. We need to move him. You can come with us if you want. No, Dad. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! JUDGED WITHOUT JUSTICE ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL "EST-CE AINSI QUE LES HOMMES JUGENT?" Jesus, where are you guys? I'm all alone here. Come on, our we're going to lose! Aren't we playing together? Martin, enough. Come on! It's four against one here! -Martin, I'm talking to you. -I can't win. Go take your shower. No, I was just studying... I can't believe you'd even try. Just one last game. -No, that's enough. -Or we're going to lose. Mom says it's time for Martin to take his shower. Stop! Don't listen to her. They heard me. Go on. You're always checking your phone for likes but I have to stop? It's for work, for me. -Sure. -Be quiet and go take your shower. It's dinnertime. OK. Be right back, guys. I show my 15-year-old son the slideshow. What's with Laurent? What'd he say? He's not Zen enough? Right. We picked the graph together. Get some rest. See you. This is the design. If you want to change the title for a slide, you click here. There's a shortcut for that. Wow. Where'd you learn that? -Guess. -Yeah. You'll be OK without me? Hey, hey. Give me a kiss. OK. -Goodnight. -Night. What about me? -Goodnight. -Goodnight. I've got some work to do. I'll leave you in good company. I'm going to reply to my many admirers. Hello? You forgot to tell me something. What's going on? Hello? This is Detective Defils from the Versailles police. Please open up. Right away. Thank you. Hello. -Gustavo Santini? -That's me. We have a search warrant from Judge Belloua. Start with this room. What am I being accused of? What are you looking for? You've got a real control tower here. Cameras everywhere. If you tell me what you're looking for, I can help you. You have something to hide. -I have nothing to hide. -Gustavo? Gustavo, what's going on? I have no idea... Return to your room, please, ma'am. We're conducting a search. Come with me. You are the owner of a gray Volvo, license plate number AP739BX? I have a gray Volvo, but I don't know the number by heart. Did you get into an accident? No. Where is your car? Charming room. You have great taste. Sylvain, go ahead. Go on. Great choice. My ex wore it. Very nice. Why are you ransacking my home? We're not ransacking it. We're doing our job. At this stage of the investigation, I can't say. Investigation? What did we do? You, nothing, at least not so far. How much are these? Must be expensive. Did you pay for them? Calm down. Sit here. I have some questions for you. When did you marry him? 16 years ago. Why? How are things in the bedroom? Excuse me? I'm just asking if you still have sex with your husband. That's none of your business. Usually, when there's a TV in the bedroom, not much is going on anymore. Believe me, we have a normal sex life. Our lab is about to sign a contract with the US. This meeting is six months in the making. I have to be in at 9:30. This is the most important meeting of my career. This is good work. What is? The hood was replaced. It's very nice work. A pro job. What happened? I hit a pole in a parking garage. So, you did have an accident. Yeah, it was at least two years ago. Maybe three. If you know better, what do you want me to say? Maybe? Not maybe. Definitely. Who did the work? Destruction Auto. Heard of it? In Carrières-sous-Poissy. Right. Would you put your password in? Ever heard of confidentiality? This is a company computer. It has confidential data on it. You won't log in? No, I'd rather not. Then take the computer. -Captain! -Commander. Commander... I spent half the night working. This meeting is important. -Boss. -It's urgent. Let me go to the meeting, and then I'll be all yours. Is this yours? Yes. There's one thing I don't get. Either you're some kind of genius, or you're a complete idiot. You had three years to get rid of your car and this jacket. And instead, you took good care of them. I don't understand what's going on. We're going to continue this conversation in my office. As of 8:16 this morning, you are being placed under arrest for suspicion of attempted kidnapping and first-degree murder. Attempted kidnapping and first-degree murder? Is this a joke? You have the right to an attorney. Don't do this in front of my wife and son. If you've done nothing wrong, you have nothing to fear. Stop! Stop filming. Are you the fraud section? This is about my husband's work? I can't tell you anything, ma'am. I'm going to ask you to read and sign the search report. Thank you. Why was I asked intimate questions about my marriage? If you remember anything, call me. Why did you change the hood? I told you, I hit a pole in a parking garage. Where? At Les Halles. I don't drive the Volvo much. We bought it when Martin was born. I kept it for sentimental reasons, that's all. Sentimental. Let's come back to the parking garage. You didn't call your insurance company to avoid the penalty? Exactly. I see. But why would a guy like you, who has no money problems, drive out to a scrapyard to get his hood changed? When the dealership is right next door? I called them. The wait was two weeks. Plus, he pays in cash, like he has something to hide. Ever tried paying by card at a junkyard? OK, sure. Where were you on June 24, 2017, between 9 and 9:30 a.m.? At the office, I imagine. On a Saturday? It happens. Rarely, but it happens. So were you at the office or not? How should I remember where I was 3 years ago? -Seriously! -Watch your tone. If you give me my phone back, I could find something maybe. Don't bother. In the observation report the police drew up from that day, here's where you were June 24, 2017, between 9 and 9:30 a.m. Dad! I've been chasing him for three years. I can confirm. You really think that was me? What do you think? That you're making a mistake. Other people own gray Volvos. To run someone over, you'd need a good reason, right? You're telling me. Do I know the victim? Your relationship was short-lived. Bertrand Dalmas, 37 years old, died at the scene, leaving behind an orphaned 13-year-old daughter. I don't know that person. I... I've never met that man. -Do you know where he's taking us? -No. Martin, don't talk about this at school, OK? -For you. -Thanks. We've got new info. New info. No criminal history. But they did get your phone open. Here's your texts with Beatrice. She's my manager. You seem close. She must be mad that I didn't show, since you didn't let me warn her. I can confirm that. Especially when she found out why. But I'm innocent! How many times do I have to say it?! On Saturday, June 24, 2017, your phone was at your house at 8:20. Then, nothing till 12:10. What's that mean? That you turned it off. That's not a good look. The murder occurred between 9:00 and 9:30 a.m. You live 20 minutes from the scene. So why did you turn your phone off? I didn't turn it off, I never do that. Maybe it died. I don't know. You don't know. Commander! -Yes. -Excuse me. Nothing from the search. Everyone has a jean jacket. All we have is the car. That's not much. We'll have a confession soon. You can count on me. If you could change something, what would it be? I don't know. Actually, I'd like to be older. Are you serious? Yeah. No more boarding school, no more classes. I could flirt with whoever. Old like this? No! I didn't even see that. With glasses. I wish I looked like Kendall Jenner. Perfect skin, tall, thin, gorgeous... -I didn't think I'd do that well. -Good job! Where were you? With the teacher. -Why? -What happened? My grades. That bad? Claire, the principal needs you. What'd I do? Don't talk back. Want me to come? No, it's fine. My only fear is that this might further destabilize her. She was well on her way to getting her GED, but she's been struggling recently. She rushes through her work, talks back in class, smokes in her room... I understand your concern, and I share it. Unfortunately, we have no other witnesses. I trust you, Commander. You know her as well as I do. I've referred to the judge in charge of her guardianship. Come in! Did you find him? Yes. Maybe. Are you OK? Who is he? I can't tell you yet. We're going to have you do a lineup. -Does that mean I'll see him? -Yes, but he'll be behind glass. He won't be able to see you. You'll need to pick him out of the lineup. I don't mind doing that. It won't be easy. OK, Claire, you can go back. I need to speak with the commander. What didn't you get about "don't dawdle"? I'm not dawdling. What's that? You know what it is. Haven't you heard "no makeup before 25"? Oh, come on! All my girlfriends wear it. I'm not doing it in secret. How much is it? Under 10 euros. OK, get it, but only that. It's work. I have to take this. Remember the PIN? Yeah. Yeah, what's up? Are you serious, guys? Let me help you with that. Hang on. Let me go! Stop! Dad! Dad! No, Dad! So? Is it coming back to you now? I'm supposed to know this girl? Stop playing dumb, Santini. Sorry, I'd like to help you out, but I don't recognize her. You must have spent some time staring at her. Does she get you hard? What are you implying? She's just a kid! Anything else in his phone? No. Oh, one thing. Mr. Santini takes pictures of his erect penis. That's not illegal. We also found quite a few porn videos that he visits regularly. Really? Whether you like it or not, porn is legal. As long as it's between consenting adults, of course. If every man who watches porn is a sexual delinquent, you've got your work cut out. Did you find anything? No! So that's enough. Not all men ask their wives to shave, so they'll look like a little girl. I never asked my wife to do that. That's not what she told me when I spoke to her. You're lying. But you'd like to. -No. -Yes. You know what, you win. I'm not saying anything else without a lawyer. OK? OK. I NEED YOUR HELP FOR ONCE. IT'S URGENT, VERY URGENT. THANK YOU. Would you look at this! What a wonderful vegetable patch. Amazing! What are these, squash? And these are pumpkins? Red kuri squash. Oh, OK. I thought those grew on trees! I can't find anything for Saturday the 24th, or that Friday. They're so cute. Usually we go to the countryside to see my parents, but I usually make a note. -You could have forgotten. -No, I'm pretty OCD. -Oh. -I get that from my mother. I'm sorry. I broke it. I'm sorry. It's OK. -Can I take it? -Yes. I'll try to grow it on my balcony. That's a great idea -- eggplant slices with goat's cheese! I'll try that. We didn't go, because usually, I always post photos right away, and look. I replied to some comments, so we were here. It'll come back to you. Your husband is counting on you to know what you did. What happens if he doesn't have an alibi? Hello, Mr. Santini. Francoise Synthes. Are you my court-appointed lawyer? No, your wife contacted me. I love her blog. Without her, I couldn't cook at all. Right. Does Sophie think I'm guilty? Oh, no! Quite the contrary. She's convinced you're innocent. Have a seat. Oddly enough, innocent people need lawyers the most. Thanks for coming so soon. Of course. So what happened? I don't know. I can't remember what I was doing that day. I know we used to go away for the weekend a lot, but you'd have to check with Sophie. It's up to them to prove you're guilty. You don't need to prove your innocence. I've read your file. The issue of the car accident is what concerns me. You had your car repaired at a scrapyard 20 miles away? Were you having money problems? No, I just didn't want to tell my wife, that's all. I know it's silly, but she can be a little annoying about that stuff. I did that on my lunch break. You should have gone and had lunch. It's an unfortunate coincidence. The guy gets hit on Saturday, and later that day, you go get your car repaired in secret. The timing looks bad. Coincidences happen. Yes. But the police don't like it, and neither do the courts. Are we there already? Excuse me. Mr. Santini needs to come with me. We have an eyewitness. Already! I wasn't warned. I can't say any more. Come with me. Thanks. I'll let you get settled in your office. Come on. Thank you. Stand over there next to the young man. Spread your feet apart. Look straight ahead. Spread your legs. Hold up the sign. Higher. Great. Turn to the side. And back. Number four. Put the jacket on. Number five. Put the jacket on. Five. Careful, Claire. If you have any doubts, tell us. It's hard to remember a face three years later. It's number five. You're sure? Yes. OK, we're done here. Thank you. It's you, number five! You killed him! No, don't do that. What'd she say? She recognized you. -No, Claire! -Number five! Come on. I want to talk to her. She recognized you! She recognized you. It's over. Commander. Not now. I have to call the judge. Give me two minutes. I get the feeling that you have a close relationship with this girl. Am I wrong? Well the investigation has lasted three years now. That could pose certain procedural problems. Is that all? To come back to your protégée, you are aware that her identification does not qualify as irrefutable proof. That's not for you to judge. You're right. Where you're wrong is that you underestimate the context. Three years have passed. Claire was young. She saw her attacker only briefly, and in an extremely tense situation. Some faces you don't forget. There's also one's desire to put a face to her father's killer. It's only human, of course, but in terms of evidence, it's debatable. We'll see. How are you hanging in there? What's going to happen now? We're going to get him to confess. Then we'll refer him to the DA, who will bring him before a judge. Is he going to go to jail? There's a good chance that he'll be put behind bars, yes. Why did he do it? There's nothing to understand. He's just a sicko. You need to stop wondering this stuff and trust the justice system. OK? Think of yourself. Of your future. And make me happy by working hard at school. It's important. -Will we keep seeing each other? -Of course. I'm not going to walk out of your life. RUE JEAN MERMOZ TOWARD RUE DU FOSSE Please! Please! I need to use the bathroom! He'll be naked in no time. Please! I need to use the bathroom! This is inhuman! Open up! BILLS: 2017 2017 ACCOUNTING Hello, you've reached Francoise Synthes. Leave a message and your number and I'll call you back as soon as I can. Go ahead. You're free. You can go home. Don't leave the country. Here's your lawyer. I don't know how you did it, but thanks. Thank your wife. People with OCD can be annoying, but there's a good side. Do you really think he's guilty? Of course it's him. But we have no evidence, nothing. I looked him up on social media. He has a normal family life. His wife is adorable. You should go home and get some rest. What are you going to do? Keep doing my job. Is there anything about him online? No. Give me your phone. What's his name again? Gustavo Santini. It talks about your dad's death, but this is all from three years ago. The only stuff on Gustavo is on business sites. They say he's the financial director of a pharma company. There's nothing about him getting arrested. It did just happen, though. Here. Claire! Claire, please. Stop acting like a child. Where are you? You lied to me. You're a liar! I didn't lie! We have no proof. I recognized him. Isn't that proof? Yes, but it's not enough for the judge. The judge won't bring a case against him with that. So my word isn't proof? I know, but that's not how the justice system works. The justice system sucks. If it's him, I promise I'll get him. Why'd you say "if"? He has an alibi. He was buying a washing machine or something. He could have lied. We have his credit card receipt. It doesn't prove he's innocent, but we have to prove he's guilty. That's how it works? Should have told me. I was sure he'd confess. I trusted you. You still can. Why didn't you kill him? Or shoot him? Don't be ridiculous, Claire. You can't help me? I'm not giving up on this. I hate you. Claire, are you with us? WELCOME TO MY VEGETABLE PATCH This man's name is Gustavo Santini. Three years ago, he tried to kidnap me. My father tried to stop him, but he hit him with his car. What are you going to post today? I don't know. What? Why are you looking at me like that? Maybe you forgot, but you didn't buy the washing machine. What? I found it online, and I knew exactly which one I wanted. You gave me your credit card. Because mine wouldn't come with the guarantee. OK. And where was I? With Martin? No, he was with me. What's wrong? You don't think I killed that guy? No. OK. No, of course not. You freaked me out. I'm just wondering if the cops can figure out that we gave false testimony. I don't know. Three years later, and they have no proof. No, but I'm worried. Did you tell anyone? No. Not even your lawyer? No. OK. Then we're fine. They could have video surveillance, but that's destroyed automatically after six months. It'll be our little secret. I wish you'd take some more time for us. I promise. Don't you have to go to work? I don't feel like it! You have to show Beatrice you're innocent. Yeah. You're right. As usual. See you tonight! See you! Thanks. I wouldn't wish that on anyone, really. I can't even be mad at you. Let's take a selfie! -Yeah. -Come on! Victoire, I can't see you! -Closer. -Is that good? That'll be the rumors to bed. Smile! -Thank you. -Thanks. Gustavo, in my office, please. -About the... -Yeah... We won't get a second chance. Give me some time. I'll prove to them that they'd be wrong to do without us. OK. I'm counting on you. We lead the market in psychotropics. They won't find anyone better. We'll get the lawyers on it and sue. The damages are enormous. -What are they accusing you of? -They didn't tell you? No. The cop was mostly wondering if we were having an affair. You're worrying me. What did they accuse you of? Of running over a guy in a parking lot. How could they mistake you for someone? What'd you tell them about us? The truth. No sex on the job. This man's name is Gustavo Santini. Three years ago, he tried to kidnap me. My father tried to stop him, but he hit him with his car. The police found him. I know it's him. I recognized him. But the police let him go. Help me, please. He has to be judged for what he did. "We're going to shut your site down, "bitch." "They need cooks in prison." It's just been non-stop threats all morning. Turn the comments off. The Internet kills private life. What do I do about Martin? People are bullying him. The principal called me to ask to keep him at home until this blows over. This isn't normal. No, it's not. Better than getting beaten up... Soon we won't be able to go outside. We have to stop this! Online harassment is punishable by law. We'll file suit for libel and defamation. How long will that take? Several days. "Santini rhymes will asshole." These jackasses. What do I do about school? Just wait and see. Eh? You and Gustavo are going to pay. We need to call this girl and ask her to retract her video. We can ask the site hosts to take the video down The problem is, each site has its own criteria. And those criteria don't necessarily correspond to French law. So we have no recourse? Mrs. Santini, Claire's video has gone viral. We will sue for damages, but for now, you're going to have to grin and bear it. For how long? Soon it'll be someone else's turn. What if it's not? It will be. This will blow over soon. What if it doesn't? People will forget. I know it's not easy, but you have to be strong. Jump! You're making me cold! I'm colder when I move. No way, it warms you up. -I'm telling you. -No. Hang on. Shit, it's the principal. What'd she say? She knows we're not there. How can she know already? I don't know. She's too much. I think that's them. -Really? -Yeah. Yeah. Are you stressed? A little. Hey. Hello. I'm Estelle Vivien. This is Guillaume. He's going to film. I brought my best friend, Lorraine. -Hi, how are you? -Good. -I didn't want to come alone. -Of course. Thanks for coming. Everything's going to go just fine. I'm here to help you. Just let us guide you, OK? Great. So, we're going to do a kind of reenactment. I'll ask you questions, and you tell me what happened three years ago. OK. Shall we get set up? We're not ready. Hang on. Just a little makeover. A little lip gloss. Not too much. Don't worry. -How's that? -That's great. Perfect! Take a deep breath. -OK. -Let's do it! OK. Nearly three years to the day later, we're here with Claire Dalmas, who's going to tell us about the tragedy she was a victim of. -Hello, Claire. -Hi. Every Saturday morning, my father and I would come here to run our errands, because it was the only day my dad didn't work. That way, we'd have time to go to the cemetery to my mom's grave. Do you think your kidnapper could have seen you here or at the cemetery? I don't remember. Maybe he saw me in the store, in an aisle. Maybe he followed me. All I remember is that I came out with the cart. I was walking over to the car. Lorraine, can you be me? -Sure. -Lorraine will play me. She's walking. Goes to the car. I'll be the kidnapper. He was at the car, here. He dropped something. I kneeled down to help him. So I picked it up. There was stuff all over. We put everything in the bag, and then he grabbed my arm. I tried to run, and I ran over like this, and he grabbed me. He tried to put me in the trunk. Doctors talk about post-traumatic stress disorder following an intense trauma like this. How do you live with this? You want to die. You lost your mother to cancer when you were little. Have other family members taken you in? I was in the hospital for three months. When I got out, they'd made no progress on the case. In the video you posted, you accuse a man. You give his identity. That's serious. You have no doubt that he's guilty? You believe it's him? I'll never forget his face. It was him. Gustavo Santini. Let's leave. What? And go where? What are you looking for? Flights to Buenos Aires. I'm not going to be humiliated like this. Your lawyer can't prove the truth. You can't leave, Dad. They'll arrest you. Then we'll drive somewhere. I don't know. Where do you want to go? If you run, it means you're guilty! So? What does it change? Let me show you something. This site was created ten minutes ago. It already has 500 likes. Read it! "This isn't Santini's first time." "He left Argentina "because he was wanted for pedophilia." You were five when you came to France. -Be patient. You'll get your say. -This will never stop, Sophie! Even my own son thinks I'm a murderer. Gustavo, stop. I can't stop asking myself what you were doing that day. I don't know. I don't know what I was doing. I don't remember! If Martin was with me, then you had gone out. Or he'd have been with you. I don't know! I went running. I don't know! That girl recognized you! Why would she lie? If you're guilty, tell us now. Stop it! You're driving me nuts! I can't believe this. Sometimes I feel like I did do it. You're suffocating me. Who knows? Maybe you're right. Maybe I suppressed it. Maybe I blacked out. I am the murderer. Who's there? Come out! I'm here. Gustavo, stop it. -Cowards! -Stop it. No! Not you! Don't believe that girl. Can you explain this? What now? A petition put out by an association for victims of pedophilia. It's gotten 4,500 signatures in two hours. It's fake! Can you really see me... Why is this girl accusing you? How does she know you? She doesn't know me. She's upset that the cops let me go. She needs someone to blame. She has it out for me! Nothing about her story holds up. I'm going to go on offense. The name of the lab keeps showing up. People are going to come after us. It's bad for the brand. Bea, stop. You know me. Not that well, it seems. You can trust me. Put yourself in my shoes. This is getting to be a lot. What do I tell the board? What do we tell our clients? And the American lab? I'll prove my good faith to them. You're underestimating the Internet. Open your eyes, Gustavo. You're being canceled. Thanks for your support. I'm sorry. This has gone too far. I can't help you anymore. HELP INDICT GUSTAVO SANTINI Evening, ma'am. Is something wrong? I brought your husband's computer back. Usually it takes longer, but it seemed to be important for his work. Oh, thank you. How are you doing? Fine. Fine. Goodnight. Can I ask how you found him? Last week, we searched a junkyard and arrested the owner, who was a fence. We found out that your husband had the hood of his car replaced three days after the murder. You didn't know? I did. Yes. I'm used to it. My husband's a distracted driver. Oh? Thanks. Goodnight. Goodnight, ma'am. Octopus risotto. How are you? That looks good. So, how many new subscribers today? Officer Broussy brought your computer back. The cops are working after hours now. That's new. Want some wine? Why did you hide from me that you got into a car accident? I didn't. I just forgot to tell you. That's all. Usually you tell me. Yeah, I hit a pole in a parking garage. Not the end of the world. All the more reason to tell me. I didn't want to you to get on my ass about it. Usually I handle repairs. I know. I wanted to handle this on my own. I shouldn't have. End of argument. Why are you hiding things from me? What are you looking for? What else am I going to find? Who were you with that day? -You can tell me anything. -Stop it! Stop! What are you talking about? You think I'm guilty? I gave false testimony because I believe you're innocent. If you regret, go on back. Tell the cops, "Sorry, "I bought the washing machine." "I lied to you." "Here's my husband." "We can start over." Go ahead, if you want. I swear. Do it. Excuse me. I'm sorry. I turn into an asshole when I'm tired. This is crazy. Your video's gone so viral. Everyone's talking about it and sharing it. -What? -Have you seen Snapchat? What? We're at 226,000 views. 226,000 views. It's been shared 110,000 times. -Seriously? -Yeah! This is nuts. Santini's gonna be instafamous. On Twitter, even, some politician lady shared it. She's got tons of followers. Did she comment on it? Yeah, she said: "Unconditional support for Claire. What is the justice system doing?" And there's a guy who says he was there when it happened. What's he say? "I got to the parking lot five minutes after. Horrifying. "The father's legs were broken. We are all with you, Claire." What an asshole. He went back to his normal life. That'll be over soon. I've got a comment here. "A pedophile walking free!" Someone tagged his family on Facebook. Plus, now you're the most popular girl in school! And when I say popular, I mean that slut Roxane is nothing compared to you now. She's so over. Jesus. WE'RE GONNA KILL YOU AND YOUR FATHER! SLEEP WITH ONE EYE OPEN I thought it was over? You said the police were wrong, that you were innocent. Why are you saying this? Look! Look! Here! I can't go to school. Nobody will speak to me. I'll never have friends again. This is a bunch of BS, Martin. They let me out. If I'd done it, I'd be in jail. Why are they saying this? They're saying our car hit her father, and that you tried to kidnap her. It's not true! Can you see me doing that? Can you see me killing someone? That girl says it was you. She recognized you. She's been lying from the start. She's lying. Do you trust me or not? Listen to me. Look at me. I've never killed anyone, OK? She said you wanted to kidnap her. To rape her. -What's wrong with you? -Give me your phone. -Come here. -What's wrong with him? Give your grandparents a hug for me. Drive safe, OK? And call me. Don't believe what people say. People say a lot of stupid stuff. Maybe Dad's done stuff you don't know about. No. Your father is a good man. He came to France when he was little, with his mother. She wanted him to grow up in a democracy. What was going on in Argentina? There was a military dictatorship. Your grandfather was killed. Why doesn't Dad talk about it? Because he's a secretive person. Did you know his mother? Not for long, unfortunately, because she was already sick when I met your father. But what a character she was. If he didn't listen to her, she'd tell him he was going to turn into a duende. What's that? An evil being with little eyes and pointy teeth. So he had better toe the line. Dad? Yeah, Dad. I'd like to first say that I deplore and strongly condemn the insults and speculation circulating online. All this anonymous cowardice had no influence on my decision to ask you here today. I'm planning on proceeding with a criminal investigation. You have no new evidence. We have some new testimony from social media. You just condemned social media. A 14-year-old girl says she recognized Mr. Santini. She claims he followed her on her way home from school and spoke to her before pushing into the trash can area to touch her. She fought him off and managed to escape. When was this? A few months ago, though the victim doesn't remember precisely what day. I'm surprised that you give much credence to such accusations, Your Honor. One: unverifiable. Two: slanderous. This act of sexual abuse took place in your town, Mr. Santini. The DA has taken this case on, and I plan on proceeding with a criminal investigation and placing you under judicial supervision. Do you understand, Mr. Santini? Yes. Sorry. Commander Defils will question you again. I'm innocent, Your Honor. My life has become hell. I'm losing everything: my job, my reputation, even my family. It's very close to persecution. Don't you think? Much remains unclear about this case that deserves to be cleared up. Particularly your client's alibi, with his credit card. Did you hear the radio this morning? This girl complaining on social media about sexual harassment. The guy is obviously devastated. It's a catastrophe for his career. And no suit's been filed. -Right. -None. What's my client doing here? I have to go. Mine is calling me. See you. Santini! Santini! Santini! Santini, are you in here? I have just learned that the primary suspect in the Claire Dalmas case, Gustavo Santini, attempted to commit suicide here. Mom! I see his attorney, Ms. Synthes. What's going on? -Hello, -Look! Can you give us any news? How should we interpret this? There's nothing to interpret. I can only say what happened in Judge Belloua's chambers. Is he dead, Mom? ... a direct connection to my client's desire to end things. I want to reassure his family and loved ones. Mr. Santini is currently at the Versailles Hospital. We're relieved to know he's alive. Did he express regret? Did he confess? No! This was a desperate act of an innocent man who's been harassed... Harassed? I'm sorry, but the question is why would a man who's been claiming he's innocent for months try to kill himself? Is this a refusal to submit to justice? The problem today is that social media set themselves up as arbiters of truth without allowing the accused to speak. They have become a vast site of public lynching. When the accused are no longer presumed innocent, the justice system must return to reason and make its voice heard. My client is innocent. Cut. Martin is inconsolable. He blames himself for getting upset with you. He thinks it's his fault. Tell him I love him. I was under too much pressure. What about us? Did you think about us? Do you realize how hard this is? Forgive me. You're wrong. It wasn't me. What do you want? Huh? What more do you want? You've already ruined my life. Yes? Hello, Mr. Santini. Can I come in? Can we talk? What do you want? Ah, you're moving out. Yes. The house is for sale if you're interested. It's far beyond my means, Mr. Santini. My wife and son are in Caen. I need to reconnect with them. I wanted to tell you in person that you're going to be cleared of all charges. Yeah. I should kick your ass for what you put me through. You destroyed my life. Yes. So get the hell out! I have a favor to ask. Oh, no! No! That's too much for me. Mr. Santini, she's young. She's going to have to recover. She can't without your forgiveness. She grew up with her cell phone, the Internet, social media. It's not her fault. I'm sorry. You've reached Sophie Santini. Leave me a message and I'll call you back. Thanks. Sophie, it's me. I remember. I know where I was. I was exhausted. You'd let me sleep in. When I woke up, the house was empty. I went for a walk downtown, and there was a garage sale. I came across a record my mother used to love. That's it. A garage sale. Imagine that as an alibi. Anyway, I wanted to show you that record, but oh well. I love you. Adam Lozier Subtitling: Hiventy
