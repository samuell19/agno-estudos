Let's go. BEATS PER MINUTE Hello and welcome to ACT UP. As an introduction, the group was founded in 1989 along the lines of ACT UP New York. What is ACT UP? A group founded in the gay community to defend the rights of people with AIDS. ACT UP doesn't provide patient support. It's an activist group. If you're here this evening, you've seen our actions on TV or in the press. Those actions are decided here during our weekly meeting, the WM, every Tuesday at 7 pm. As you'll see later, ACT UP has rules for speaking. Two moderators manage debates. You can speak on any subject, if you put your hand up, enroll on a list and wait your turn. If you speak too long, the moderator will go like this. Likewise, we don't applaud what others say. To express approval, you simply click your fingers. It won't drown out the speaker or delay debates. Finally, one last thing you need to understand: As soon as you join ACT UP, whatever your HIV status, you must accept to be viewed by the media and public as HIV-positive. We'll start now. If you have questions, see me. I'll be down there. Don't forget to fill out the forms if you want to join. Enjoy the meeting. Good evening, everyone. Welcome to ACT UP Paris' weekly meeting. We have a pretty full agenda. So it'd be wonderful to avoid endless speeches. Remember, no smoking here so as not to indispose the sick. You can smoke in the hallway. Don't debate there. Any comments must be made here. We have four new members. Stand up when I say your name. We have Patrice... And Judith... Good evening. Then Jérémie... Stand up. Welcome, Jérémie. And Nathan. Hi, Nathan! We're sad to announce the death of Alain Isnard, an activist who joined two months after we were founded. I'll let Thibault speak. Just a second. His photo is in the press round-up. You may not remember him. He'd stopped coming to WMs. But when the group was founded, Alain was a very important activist. He got us our first two computers, which was quite a feat. He gave up coming here, severing ties after he got cryptosporidiosis. There. As usual, you have postcards to send to the French President, with Alain's name, to inform him of his death. To remind Mitterrand of the AIDS epidemic. Let's do the AFLS debrief. There's a lot to say. Sophie, over to you. In case you don't know, the AFLS is the French Anti-AIDS Agency. Thanks. Go ahead. Ok, thank you. I'll try to be objective. It'll be tough as I'm a bit sickened by how it went down. Could everyone who took part join the debate? Guys, please... - Hurry it up. - It's important. Thank you. It all began as planned. We had no problem sneaking into the conference hall. Whoever the guy speaking was, he was fucking boring. I bet a few poz guys croaked during his speech. Good morning. First let me hail the organization of this symposium along with the diversity and quality of its participants. Ok, let's go. We're ACT UP Paris. The AFLS was founded over three years ago and there's still no decent prevention campaign. France has twice as many cases as the UK or Germany. You're failing badly. Nothing for gays, for drug addicts, women or foreigners... We've done campaigns for homosexuals. The prime minister's office censored the campaign. It has only appeared in publications that no one reads. I can't let you say that! I screwed up. Yes, Marco? It was my fault. I couldn't see from the back. I couldn't hear either and I panicked a bit. I heard a voice say, "Hey, it's you next." So once I had a window, once I saw Bernin, I felt I had to go for it. We've screwed up before. He threw the blood too soon. It's no big deal. No big deal, even if I looked dumb, talking alone. No worries. The real problem came after. Two people pounced on Bernin, really roughly and handcuffed him to a post. I don't know who had the idea or decided to do that... You know very well who it was! Let her finish first. I think it's counter-productive. It got other groups mad instead of making them react for once. That made it impossible. We never cuffed anyone before. The cuffs are in case the cops turn up, to cuff ourselves. Can we answer now? No one's stopping you. Ok, Max, let off steam. Thanks. True, we improvised but we saw it was screwed. It was like some folk show. They were thinking, "ACT UP's at it again, but it'll soon be over." Marco's fuck-up was a turning point for us. Suddenly, their compassion turned into indignation. In ten years, they'd never shown any anger. We had to seize the opportunity. We did the first thing we thought of. Bernin, resign! Bernin, resign! And I think we were right. We wanted to mark minds by throwing fake blood and we did it! We just went further than planned. It wasn't premeditated. Markus? No one said it was premeditated. Sophie's right. It was really violent. Throwing blood is already a lot, but we've never handcuffed anyone. It's crazy! The AIDES rep felt bad. Even I felt I'd been taken hostage. Poor baby! Go ahead, Sean. Why are we debating this? The action didn't bomb. Sorry, it was a big success. Sophie, there was no physical violence. Just a bit of restraint... Not at all. The guy offered no resistance. I'm glad we've shown up the hypocrisy. What is the AFLS? An agency founded by the government to shift accountability. Since then, nothing. In meetings, they tell us, "We agree, but we can't shock the public. It'd be counter-productive." And now we have 6,000 new cases a year. Hold on... The AFLS campaigns are so abstract, you forget HIV is sexually transmitted. Thank you. Nothing on gays, junkies or hookers. Nothing on those hardest hit by the epidemic! I saw you! I'm nearly done. Too bad if the AFLS felt humiliated or if our pals in AIDES were shocked. We'll keep pissing the state off until there's a real prevention policy. - Can we move on? - It's important. I know. I understand your panic, but the world's not about to end. Have other groups reacted? Fabien? I'm checking that right now. There's something interesting in the AIDES communiqué. "AIDES condemns ACT UP's action, in attacking the AFLS chairman, Michel Bernin, etc, etc..." Hold on, how does it end? "We condemn ACT UP's brutal and childish methods, despite understanding its impatience with the AFLS' inertia." C'mon, the anger's just for show. Libération's headline tomorrow... "Historical and hysterical break in the fight against AIDS." I'll read an extract. "ACT UP's action highlights the authorities' disregard for French homosexuals." Let's move on. We won't be done before midnight. Talking of prevention... we've printed our new poster. Close-up on a bit of anal sex. Post it in the Marais, along the river... In your parents' homes. For our dyke sisters and junkies too. Bill-posting gear can be picked up afterwards. Let's move on to the medical commission. Commissions focus on specific topics: Drugs, women, infected blood, foreigners... Prison too! I was going to say it. There are only two of us for now... Maybe we don't want to spoil it for you two. Four or five can be fun too. Commission meetings feature on the schedule. Go on. A few weeks ago, we voted for action against the Melton Pharm lab that still refuses to release the toxicity results of its protease inhibitor. A protease inhibitor is an antivirus molecule about which we don't know much. They're holding back. It seems that Melton Pharm are waiting for the next conference to announce it. But the next conference is in Berlin a year from now. They don't give a shit about us. The idea is to get the results from the lab ourselves and see what they tell us. Put your hands up to take part to give us an idea. Come on! Even new guys want to join in. There should be more of us for a new molecule. Even our chairperson will be there! That's about fifteen of us. We'll use the phone tree a day before. Here's how it works. Each one calls three others who call three others, etc. Julien? How do we get in? What? - How do we get in? - The door. I've seen the lab entrance. There's a security lock and two automatic doors. I'll stop you. Automatic doors don't chop off arms or crush skulls. They're not there to mince people. We're safe. To take part in an action, bring your ID in case we're arrested, with water and meds if custody lasts a while. We'll only be a few minutes. We're ACT UP Paris, an AIDS advocacy group. Where are they going? The lift's too small. Take the stairs. We're non-violent people with AIDS. We're here to see Melton Pharm. They're climbing over the gate! HIV-positive only. - What floor? - 12. I'm kidding! It's great, I haven't showered all week as my bath is full of fake blood. I think Marco overdid it a bit. So you can repaint the lab with lots of pretty designs. - What are you doing? - Give me one. Wait till we reach the offices. You'll get it everywhere. Can you tell me about this new action? It's simple. We want Melton Pharm to release the test results of a new protease inhibitor. It's a new molecule that offers hope for HIV-positive people. We'll only be 15 minutes. - Call the cops. - I'm doing it. That's not nice. I don't have any choice. I don't recognize it. - Sure it was floor 12? - Yes. Is this the 12th floor? No, this is the 10th floor. - It's not here? - No. - What's up? - Wrong floor. - So you're neg? - Yeah. Too bad, you're so dishy. Ok, this is it. Give me a pouch. Listen up... Keep moving, ok. All right. Melton Pharm, killer! What the hell? Melton Pharm, killer! You've got blood on your hands! Melton Pharm, killer! You've got blood on your hands! Which way? Down the corridor. Melton Pharm, killer! You've got blood on your hands! Hold on, guys. Gimme a pouch. Shit! Are you mad? Yes, we're mad when we're sick, on AZT every four hours, with the runs every night while you let us die! This is what a person with AIDS looks like! We're aware of what you're going through. But this is unacceptable. You're aware of nothing! If you were, we'd have your results! Things don't have to be like this. Let's try to talk. But we don't have time! We don't have time! We're croaking, get it? This way. We're ACT UP Paris, an AIDS advocacy group. We're sick, non-violent... Treatment now! Melton Pharm's wasting time! I'm a doctor, I understand your situation... I don't give a shit you're a doctor! This is how they fight AIDS! This is how they fight AIDS! Lie down! Offer no resistance! Gently! I need water. The cops didn't give us any. It was beautiful, that blood everywhere. Their carpet's fucked. Why did I wear this? My favorite, ruined. It'll wash out if you boil it. You think so? It's wild. The cops were so scared it was real blood, they wore gloves to touch us. He's a haemophiliac! Careful, he's a haemophiliac! Shit. How was it for you? Great. He was terrified. And you're not afraid? I'm always a bit afraid, only natural. They always wear gloves. What? Cops always wear gloves to take someone in. He's defending cops! No, I'm not. It was clear they were scared. Let's focus. What on? The real subject. What's that? The photographer. What photographer? - What planet is that guy from? - The AFP. It's wild how he takes photos! I didn't notice. You were too busy. I'll show you how he does it. - He's worse! - Even more bendy. He's totally into it! Did we need three hours in a police station? That's true. It's so beautiful. Look at the sky. There are times when I see how AIDS has changed my life. It's as if... I lived things more intensely. As if I saw the world differently. As if it had more colors, more noise, more life. In the morning, mainly. I'm kidding! You had me worried. Nothing's changed, don't worry. Waking is still tough. You're joking, it's tougher. It takes me hours. You're right. The only drugs for now are AZT and DDI. They are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and target a virus protein, reverse transcriptase. As you can see in this image, the enzyme works after the virus infects a cell. It allows the RNA of the virus, its genetic code, to turn into DNA, able to blend with the host cell's genome. Once the cell's nucleus is infected, the virus can duplicate and infect other cells. So, the new therapy strategies aim to block infection at other stages in the cycle. Protease inhibitors attack virus duplication once the cell is infected. They block virion formation or create incomplete virions unable to infect other cells. This provides a lot of hope, a true alternative to drugs like AZT or DDI that have their limits. Is he serious? Any questions? It's not a personal initiative, we talked about it. We didn't say that... We didn't say what? You could have let us read it before presenting it at the WM. It all comes down to trust. Your talk was a bit much, like an ad for the labs. You needed to talk about infection, not delude people. I didn't delude anyone. I just described the current lines of research. That's not how I saw it. People will think protease inhibitors are better than AZT. Rubbish. Thibault, won't you join in? I'm listening. But this is important. It's hot. They can't die of thirst. Anyhow, my doctor, Catherine Delmas, tells me inhibitors are gnat's pee. She said "gnat's pee"? Yes. Why? Put "gnat's pee" in the minutes. Delmas isn't even in the protocol. Don't you know those people talk? She knows international researchers. She seems sure. There aren't any "international" researchers hiding the fact it doesn't work. If Melton Pharm is waiting for the Berlin conference, the protease inhibitor must be interesting. It's not gnat's pee. Personally, I liked your talk on treatment. Thanks. Too bad if the information arouses false hopes. I'll take any kind of hope going. I can't tolerate AZT and DDI isn't really working. Any side effects? No more than usual. I had to stop, it made me throw up. Usually, it's the runs. I know, but I threw up. I nearly freaked out. The doctors feared pancreatitis. The pain was atrocious. I didn't know that. It's ok now, I'm on DDC. Not great for pancreatitis. I'm ok anyhow. I just loved DDI. I love it too. My God... Nathan wants to speak? Thanks, that's a big help. I had a question. I read the medical commission's reports and they never mention a vaccine. Disappointment. Why? Not vaccines. Are trials underway? If you want work on vaccines, baby, go ahead. Since we're all poz, we're not interested. It's not that we're not interested. There aren't many vaccine trials. There is one. - Canaripox. - I forgot that one. It uses an attenuated canary virus. It's been in limbo for months. You can take it. Yellow for the canary? Not bad. I'm not sure I know enough to handle the topic. It's just two pages. You'll learn as you go, like us. The tough bitches! You say we need guys on treatment, then discourage all newcomers. He has the file. C'mon, two years ago, you didn't know how a cell worked! Sorry, I'll be ok. - Are you hurt? - No. Thanks. Feeling ok? Sure? Jérémie came to ask questions. Is that right? Want me to sum up? All right. Jérémie was infected recently and his blood work has deteriorated very rapidly. I only have 220 T4 cells left and I don't know why. It happens, but it's rare. May I see your file? This isn't a consultation. You're no doctor. You should see AIDES. You have a doctor. What does he say? He says I have to be patient and wait for the AZT to work. If you don't trust your doctor, you can change. You think he's no good? I wondered, but he's followed me from the start. He doesn't reassure you. You can try another. True. You'll be ok? Gay Pride preparation... The first session last week didn't provide enough ideas. We have a few posters, but it'd be good to talk about it again. Sophie, take over. We need more slogans. Wake up. I know it's late, but we need to move ahead. We need more people to post bills. We need slogans that are more political and punchier. The poster gets me down. I mean, it's totally ugly. The font is hideous. It's festive though. - 'Cause of the pretty colors? - It's Gay Pride. Avoid black and white and slogans like "It's us dying". Know what? "It's us dying" would have been better. We get the message. You hate it. Our watchword sucks too. Here we go. I hate, "I want you to live". What don't you like about it? It's consensual. And "I want"... I want ice cream, I want a vacation. You're silly 'cause I want you to live. You're sweet, Sean. Martin... To answer Thibault about the consensual aspect... It's not true. Gilles and I posted bills by the river. It was sunny, we felt good, we were happy to be doing it... Will this take much longer? It can't take all night. Hold on a minute. We were happy, it was sunny. And this guy came up... Can't you leave us be? We just want to have a good time. And you scare us with your posters. Don't be scared of them. It says, "I want you to live." It's upbeat. It scares guys. Be scared of AIDS instead. There you go. Done a test? Maybe you're neg and worrying for nothing. Get off our damn backs! Fuck off! It's like I said. Fags are stupid. They don't get it. They can't stand us. Gay Pride will be gloomy and wet as usual. No interesting slogans, no music, just zombie-like fags who refuse to hear about AIDS, even with upbeat slogans like "I want you to live". We have to wake up these queens by putting the disease on the street. Our chairman is getting depressed... So let's hurry up with the slogans. Yes, Mehdi. I've thought of something to make everyone happy: "Molecules for anal sex fools!" That's unifying. It's great, it can make a slogan. "Molecules for anal sex fools!" "Molecules for anal sex fools!" And blabla... round the back. Haemophiliac? What? "Haemophiliac round the back." Are you crazy? Gross! "Haemophiliac round the back." No! Hélène, got a slogan? It's a simple one, but I like it. "AIDS is me, AIDS is you, AIDS is us." Terrifying! Even the AFLS can do better than that! I'll shut my mouth then. Help! Any other slogans? Julien, got one? At last year's Gay Pride, I was with the zombies, in the rain, bored stupid... My doctor told me the day before I probably had a CMV in my eye... I was thinking something a bit pathetic, but not bad... I thought, "This could be my last Gay Pride." That's beautiful. That's a beautiful slogan. It'd have made a great poster. But a bit late. Sorry, it was a year ago. Note stuff. I always carry a notebook. Got that? Never go out without a notebook. - Sean, another idea? - Yes. With Max and Etienne, we could do a cheerleader group. Thibault won't like it, but we're working on the moves... The street theatre thing gets me down. It's like we could end up with guys on stilts. Or mimes! Poz mimes? A nightmare! It's too queer for you, but it'll be good. It'd be great to have ten people or so. Mehdi. Luc... Who else? - Me too. - Jérémie. Great! We'll recycle your slogan, Hélène. AIDS is me, AIDS is you, AIDS is us! It's like that dumb slogan we had... "They're bad..." No... "They're not nice", they're really bad." Down with, down with those who do evil! They're not nice, they're really bad. Down with, down with those who do evil! "Like one who flees attention or love" I feared your silence and left, pale "Fearing my greeting offended your gaze" If you remember, we saw that these Sonnets for Hélène were commissioned by Catherine de Medici for her protégée, Hélène de Surgères. Hélène was distraught after losing her husband and Catherine asked Ronsard... We're ACT UP Paris. We're here to talk AIDS prevention as the government won't. - Who allowed you in? - We did. Why? This won't do. Whether you're gay, dyke, straight or bi... a condom is the only protection against AIDS and other STDs. With fellatio, the risk is smaller, but does exist. No sperm in your mouth... Get out right now! Especially with lesions or sore gums. Stop handing these out. - They're minors. - You have no right! Excuse us, we're ACT UP Paris and we'd like a few minutes to talk about AIDS. - It won't take long. - Ok. Listen, this is very important. Always remember, whether you're heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual, the only effective weapon against HIV and other STDs is the condom. Use a lubricant for anal sex or with vaginal dryness. For fellatio, in other words oral sex, the risk is less important, but does exist. If you're a drug addict, use a clean syringe for each shoot and never share it. Thank you for listening and protect yourselves. Remember the map for next week! Mr Principal, you won't install condom machines despite official recommendations. I won't discuss it! You're resisting public health measures! Get out of this school! Teenagers at risk! Condoms in high schools! Why won't you install a condom machine here? Our students are minors. Condoms promote sexual relations. Kids don't have sex at 16? What world do you live in? My son is 16 and has AIDS. I wish he'd been protected. I'm sorry, but that's not the issue. Protect yourselves. Use condoms. Could I have the brochure on anal sex? All gone. Hold on. Here you go. Thank you. Protect yourselves. Use condoms. No way. - Why not? - I'm no fag. Are you out of your mind? I won't catch your AIDS shit. Hold on. I prefer it with a condom. - Prefer or want? - It's dangerous. - It's not too risky. - I prefer with. Here. All right. Hold on, I can't... I can't. Sorry. I can't with a condom. - Sorry. - It's ok. Who's that woman? Your sister? My mother. We were living in Chile then. - She's Chilean? - No. She's French. My dad's Chilean. You let her watch you fuck? Why do you say that? - Dunno. - I never thought of it. It's ok. My mum's open-minded. You're cute in that photo. Which one? This one. Thanks. How old were you? Fifteen. The year I came back here with Mum. One year later, I got infected. Who was it? My maths teacher. Mr Ducaire. Hervé. I was sixteen. I got infected the first time. Straight off. He was married. At school, they said he had a baby. Maybe he didn't know he was poz. We were in love. I trusted him. And he trusted me. Like two idiots. A week later, I was as sick as a dog. I didn't understand. Well, I did. I suspected it. I was afraid. So I did the test. And that was that. And the teacher? It was summer. We lost touch. He was older, he should've known. Yes, he should've, but I should've known too. You can't split responsibility. When you infect someone, you're 100% responsible. And when you get infected too. But what did we know then? No one talked about it. That's the state's responsibility. Right? Yes, that's right. But now we're fucking. Am I your first poz? It depends. You mean the first poz I've had sex with? You're the first to tell me. Once, I had sex with a guy aged about twenty. He wanted it without a condom. I didn't ask him but... given his age, he hadn't had much experience. I dunno... I don't really like my jaw. You don't? What's wrong with it? It's too pointy. Too jutting. No, it's fine. You're great. - You think so? - Yes. I didn't notice right away. After we came, I saw small patches on his back. I'd never seen any Kaposi's sarcoma. Only photos, not for real. I just mentioned it was good to do a test once a year. To be sure. And that using condoms had to be automatic every time. That got him mad. He said he knew what he was doing. I didn't insist. What more could you say? That he was poz? He wasn't just poz. He was sick. I know. I have a bit of Kaposi's sarcoma too. Where? You didn't see? No. Good. Against AIDS, you have no choice! Fight! Fight! ACT UP! ACT UP! Fags, dykes, wake up now! Fags, dykes, join us now! Hello. Molecules for anal sex fools! And latex for your big sex! The ANRS Roche protocol now... Someone from ACT UP wanted to speak. You wanted to talk about it, Thibault. Ok... This trial was problematic. We talked about it when you said it would last over a year. But the protocol raises even more questions... We tried to shorten it... It's not the duration. It's not? What shocked us, all of the groups, not just ACT UP, is the number of punctures involved. It's crazy. It's vital to observe lymph node activity. Have you had a lymph node puncture? No. I know it's not pleasant. No, not at all. A puncture every two weeks, for eight months. Sixteen punctures, unless I'm mistaken. The desperate few who volunteer for the trial will drop out after two months. The results will be worthless. What do you suggest instead? Nothing. We're just saying the trial isn't viable. It's not just a revised protocol then. That's obvious. You can always start the trial as outlined, but it will fail. For you. Groups from Boston and Detroit I keep listening to. If you don't like it, you're screwed. What's the photo? An ocean beach. The most beautiful place in the world. It's a photo of you too. You noticed? Can you stay with us, Thibault? Sorry. The Melton Pharm reps. To make things clear, the ANRS hasn't sided with ACT UP in the disagreement between you. It's not our role to be peacekeepers but we've informed Melton Pharm - as Mr Gilberti can testify - that we understand your impatience. We understand too... Let me finish. All right. We've gathered here today to talk things over calmly and reach a compromise. I fear that will be difficult. Great start. We fully understand your impatience, but I must inform you, sir, that violence is simply unacceptable. Throwing blood in our offices is inadmissible. There was material damage, that is far from negligible, and, above all, mental damage to a number of employees, traumatized by your acts. Why not sue us then? Sorry? If we're merely rioters, why don't you sue us? Because we're here to talk. You should do it. It'd be interesting if a pharm lab attacked a victims' group. I think that's what's stopping you. As for your shocked employees, explain what withholding information does to people with terminal AIDS. We're not here to accuse anyone, but it isn't easy - And I understand AIDES - to work with a group that resorts to violence! I'll stop you right there. All the groups here agree on one thing: Your communication - Or non-communication - is scandalous. It's not scandalous. We're here to talk, to be open with you, to... Open? Sorry, we hadn't realized. You'll give us the inhibitor results? Great! You should have told us. What use would it be? We don't have the final results. Only an expert could interpret them. I read every publication on the subject. I'm perfectly capable of reading your partial trial results! I've acquired expertise in side effects: Vomiting, diarrhea. It's time you listened. Come on... All we do is listen! As expected, we played our parts. The other groups supported us. The ANRS director acted impartial, but you could tell he wanted to lay into Melton Pharm. As for Mr Gilberti, he offered no information, but couldn't justify himself. He saw he was wrong to attack us from the start of the meeting. Max, your turn. What I'm hearing is you enjoyed setting Melton Pharm straight, but obtained nothing. We'll keep up the pressure... But how? We'll pester them with the other groups. An inter-group communiqué. Letter-writing! Hey, the back-row Radicals, calm down! We knew we'd obtain nothing. You're deluded otherwise. In that case, why are we all here? No... You know medical issues are entirely different. On prevention, health care and power, we're rock solid. In the medical field, we need to find out and learn. ACT UP needs to urge labs to extend their research. For instance, how do antiretrovirals interact with ecstasy? Sure! That's vital. It's important. Léa, something to add? We need research on how AZT interacts with hormone therapy. There are uncontrollable side effects and lots of girls have problems. Exactly. Hélène? I'd like to go back to what Max said. I agree. I think those people are duping us. If we want stuff from the labs, we have to take action. We must attack their precious image! No, the labs don't care about their image. How come? We're giving Melton Pharm great publicity for their inhibitor. Sean, you asked to speak? Lobbying won't get us anywhere. - You said so. - He's on a loop! If the labs are the med commission's domain, say so. But we're giving our report, Sean. We struck them already. We did it once, months ago now. Tilt things in our favor! The labs need us, ok. If only for their fucking trials. We have to be offensive and halt the talks. That's not fair, Sean! You imply we have friendly talks with them as if we were an elite with the selfish goal of getting new molecules. I don't have time. Not with my blood test results. We won't compare health bulletins! Mine aren't great either! I have 160 T4s left. I don't want to talk to people who won't give us trial results which may be disappointing! We can't mobilize the media on treatment. The Melton Pharm action was striking with all the blood. Not one press photo! It's the same here at ACT UP! Treatment leaves you cold. We're more numerous but the med commission needs people. Our most important commission! Why's that? We don't want to die, darling. Think you'll survive? I act as if I will. Bachir, your turn. Why are we arguing like this? We're wasting time. Do we even know what we're talking about? What prevents us lobbying and carrying out actions? For example, whenever we're free, we call the labs or send a fax to tell them, "We're sick and dying. We need the results!" The med commission can carry on talking to lab management. What's the problem? Thanks, Bachir. Sophie, you now. I wanted to react to what Bachir said about faxes. We've developed a technique... If you tape two pages together and place them in the machine... Sorry. And then tape them here, the pages will keep on turning and block their fax machine. That's a great idea! - What, Sean? - Why not invite Melton Pharm here? To answer us directly. They won't come before the AIDS conference. I think it's worth trying. Can we vote to finish up? It's 9:24 pm and we need a break. That's a good idea. Who wants to invite Melton Pharm to a WM? A huge majority. We adopt the idea of inviting lab reps to the WM. We'll take a 15-minute break. Ok? I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be? I have thrush... in my mouth. - Sorry. - No worries. Using Amphotericin? You're top of the class! You'll know more than me! Yes, I'm using it, Mum. I've never asked you what you do. What I do? Your job. It's that professional moment now? Forget it. - What d'you want to know? - Forget it. Go on. I don't know... What's your job? I'm poz, that's all. It's that simple. And how about Sophie? What? What does she do? She's a pollster, I think. That's right. And Germain? No idea. Hospital porter. - But he's more or less quit. - My turn... What does Jérémie do? He works? No, he's studying history. History. I didn't know. Screw the thrush. For 10 litres of blood, put 10 litres of water in the tub, then add a kilo of sugar and some wallpaper paste. Like for posters. Then you stir it really fast to make a whirlpool in the tub to get rid of lumps. They make it tough after. Then you add the coloring. We have three tones. It's red food coloring. It mustn't be too dark or too pink. Your nose is bleeding. - Shit. - Hold on. Lean back. On Wednesday, February 23rd, 1848, the people were on the streets and barricades were up. Around 50 demonstrators set off for the Foreign Ministry on Boulevard des Capucines. But the 14th regiment was blocking the boulevard. Torch in hand, a demonstrator stepped up to a lieutenant. A sergeant opened fire. Taking it as a signal, the troops fired. Sixteen killed and forty wounded. Then anger exploded. The corpses were placed on carts and paraded through Paris. - What is it, Jérémie? - I can't breathe. Try to get comfortable. I can't breathe. Lie down. This goes on your finger. Breathe calmly. Lean on the pillow. Relax. Breathe calmly. It's not nice, but it'll help. They even stopped at certain newspaper offices to force them to report on the scene. As a call to arms, this "corpse parade" was the monarchy's death knell. That will be my political burial. That's what I want. Parade my corpse with whistles and foghorns. Don't use my ashes. They're for my parents. I'm saying it now because, even though I'm afraid, I haven't suffered yet but I know I will. AIDS, we're dying, indifference remains. AIDS, we're dying, indifference remains. "We can observe the insincerity of the homosexual psyche," favouring cheating in relations, going from carefreeness to emotional inauthenticity. This lack of truth explains unstable homosexual relations "where trust often has no place." There. A book by Tony Anatrella. Priest and psychoanalyst. Good reviews in Le Monde and the weeklies. We get the same crap from Baudrillard. Here goes... "A virus spreads pathologically in closed circuits." It's the pathology of incest in the metaphorical sense. He who lives by the same, dies by the same. The prevalence of AIDS among homosexuals or addicts "reveals the incestuous nature of these closed worlds." We've made these stickers that read, "Warning: This book contains homophobic ideas that stigmatize AIDS victims or HIV-positive people." We'll stick them on the fly leaf of books containing repellent ideas, and those of sociologists or fake philosophers who act as our friends. They're here. Take them and use as many as you can! Thank you. Hélène wants to report on the infected blood scandal. It's more a debate. Among the papers handed out tonight, you'll have noticed one attacking me personally. It accuses my commission of demanding that ministers and politicians involved in the scandal should be jailed. I'd like to know ACT UP's position. I need an explanation. Max, you wanted to speak? The text you refer to was signed by me and Sean. You can say so. I'd like you all to read it. We take responsibility. We wrote it as we need a clarification too. We demonstrate to expose the politicians involved. But now our signs and slogans are demanding prison for them. As if we wanted them jailed. But we do. We've always said we want them sentenced. No, we want justice done. - Same thing... - No! It hurts to see ACT UP demand jail time when we're against it. Jail means no treatment, people get infected, there are no sterile syringes... What are you saying? I agree with that! But this calls me a populist! We're not calling you that. We wrote it to wake everyone up! We all got trapped into demanding jail time! I joined ACT UP because no one else was talking about it. I think Marco and I have always been loyal to you. I'm offended that you didn't talk to me first! No one questions your work. What are you after? We defend all AIDS victims. You want us to stop demanding jail time? Yes, among other things. But it's more serious. The infected blood scandal has become ACT UP's showcase. Not at all. It's sexier for the media than hookers, junkies, foreigners or prisoners! Maybe you're happy with this business, but I'm not! I don't believe this. The infected blood scandal is emblematic of the mishandling by every government. There's no syringe exchange system, no prevention targeted at fags or foreigners because the state doesn't see the seriousness. Exactly! For months, I injected my son with infected blood provided by hospitals, backed by doctors and the authorities. We know all that, Hélène. But we're contradicting ourselves. Talking of political responsibility is different from jailing people! We're not after revenge. I don't want to jail anyone, I just want a verdict. If everyone agrees here, we won't vote. It's a pity to insult each other over a few adjustments. They're not just adjustments! Let's move on to minor issues before the break. What was that about? You're crazy attacking Hélène. She's not your target, Thibault is. You'd never have done it to a guy. - Wasn't that kind of mean? - What? Humiliating Hélène. Hélène's strong, she understands. She didn't take it well. - Your husband's a drag. - He's a drag. It's pathetic laying into Hélène when you're mad at me. It's not Hélène. We don't think together. You're glad we're on TV, but we can't agree in meetings anymore! Where are we heading? I'm sick of you whining. Take over! Shut up out there! Any debate is in here, not in the corridor! It's a pain! It's not an erogenous zone. Does it hurt? No. Take the syringes... We'll be there soon. We'll move fast. Just a couple of rounds at the ministry before the cops grab us. So... Shit, it'll be shorter. Leave the signs, just take the syringes. Let's go! Junkies forgotten! Junkies murdered! 10 years ago, 4% of junkies were HIV-positive! Today, it's 30%! Interior Ministry policy is criminal! We demand clean syringes for all drug users! The state must set up syringe exchanges! End drug prohibition and launch heroin assisted treatment. Enough of the authorities' hypocrisy! He's sick! Watch out! He's sick! Ok? I'm ok. Sure? I'm ok. That didn't last long. How did you do it? Do what? It's a habit at ACT UP. We always tell how we got infected. But you, how have you stayed neg? Wow... I don't know. You fucked before the epidemic? Yes, I did. But it didn't last long. So, how was it before? Fantastic. I'd fucked with two or three guys. One, I was crazy about. Arnaud. Handsome? Honestly? No. He wasn't? But I was crazy about him. I lived down south. He'd pick me up in Aix to fuck at his place in Marseille. No one around me knew. I remember the trip by car. One day, there was a blizzard on the highway. We'd never seen one before. It caught us unawares. We stopped in the emergency lane. We thought it was, anyhow. We couldn't see. The other cars kept moving around us, as if brushing past us. As if they could ram us or blow us apart any second. I thought something odd that day... If another car crashed into ours... and we burned before being rescued, they'd find our blackened bodies and after taking weeks to identify us, people would wonder why we were together. What we were for each other. How old were you? 19. 19, I think. It seems so abstract. Shortly after, I read a magazine article about AIDS. I'd never heard of it. There was a photo of two Americans on a beach. Two photos, in fact. Before and after. In the first, they're in shape. In the second, one is at the terminal stage. His name was Kenny. He looked like a freak. I'd never seen a gay couple in a magazine before. Except it was to say homosexuals were going to die. That we were all going to die. I stopped fucking instantly. Totally? For five years. - You're crazy! - I guess... I didn't know if I could infect someone or get infected. I didn't believe in condoms. When I did, it was a liberation. I ran into Arnaud again, the guy I was in love with, and I began fucking again with him. We had a great day. At night, we went out for dinner. On the way, I saw he had trouble walking and breathing. He had lost weight too. He told me a lot over dinner. I forget what now. He was living with his parents again. He didn't mention his health. And, of course, I didn't ask. It was a weird evening, not saying stuff we should have said. He never got back in touch. A year later, I called his parents. His dad answered. He told me his son was hospitalized. When I asked why, he told me I knew why. And he got mad. So I hung up. I didn't visit him at the hospital. Did he die? I don't know. That was two years ago. I guess so. Maybe he pulled through. You can be hospitalized and then recover. Yeah, maybe. I don't know. I like to think he's alive. No... We're either dead or alive. You're right. Let's move in together. It'd be simpler. Simpler for what? You're a drag. I hate not being there. I never asked you to be. I can come Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and weekends. With work, it's tricky the other days. That's good. I can manage alone, you know. I know. But I want to take care of you. Don't say that. What? Taking care of me. It's weird. You know what I mean. I want to spend more time with you. I know. My job pays well. I'll get a new apartment. It'd be dumb not to live together. I can't do it. Can't or won't? I can't afford it. What's your rent here? 850 francs. 950 with service charges. A lot for a small place. My mom pays now I don't work. Precisely. It'd be cheaper. We'd share everything. I have no pay slips. For the deposit and so on? My parents said they'd help. It's all settled. Ok. Meet Mr Gilberti. From Melton Pharm. With... - Mr Rossi. - Agnès Lecomte. My assistants. All right... Before we start, if you haven't followed, Melton Pharm will soon launch a new molecule, a protease inhibitor, for which they don't yet have marketing authorization. We want it distributed to people with treatment failure. But the labs' managers claim there's a product shortage. So there's talk of a lottery for patients... Sorry, we never mentioned a lottery. We read that in the press. - We were shocked too. - Not as much as us. Any questions? Germain... A question about the shortage. When ACT UP activists in Boston met lab management in January, there was no shortage... It's not bad. We're controlling your cryptosporidiosis. Your T4s are stable. You're worried about the KS, but radiation can help. The lesions mustn't spread to the soles of your feet. I'll give you the number of a good place for treatment. They see HIV-positive people early morning. Indeed, American legislation is much looser than ours. We understand. Markus? You're here now and can't give us a single answer. I have 87 T4 cells left. It's absurd. It makes no sense. 87 T4 cells. AZT doesn't help, DDI never worked, and you justify the unjustifiable! We're not justifying anything. You're mistaken to think we don't care about the delicate situations you're in. You want us to help manage a shortage you created. You think we'll legitimize this crap strategy? Lie down. Roll onto your stomach. Like this? Your approach is purely demagogical. The Boston head office controls you. You're here to keep us waiting. Thank you. Your strategy is obvious. You've arranged a shortage to plug the new molecule. Classic company strategy. Moreover, you launched the lottery idea almost as a PR stunt... That's disgusting. I agree, it's disgusting. It's your head office's plan but we don't care. We'll step up the pressure and obtain medication for people who need it. This debate was only supposed to take 15 minutes. We need to discuss more important stuff than you, so we'll ask you to leave. I'll show you out. I think it's time now for a huge demo against pharm labs. And Gay Pride is happening soon. We need to shake it up. Let's make it festive! And talk about treatment too, I've had a great idea. We have the funds. We'll cover a huge truck with speakers. I want a boombox on wheels. On one side, it'll say "Ignorance is your enemy" and, on the other, "Knowledge is a weapon". Sober, white on black. We'll be able to dance and talk about treatment. Let's do signs targeting the labs. And we need to make the disease more visible. Like the groups in the USA, we should put our hospitalized friends in the front line. In wheelchairs like in NYC. What are you talking about? That's crazy! What? I'm not sick enough? I didn't mean you. I don't look sick enough? Neither does Markus? Nor Muriel, nor you? Doesn't this shock anyone? I've had enough of you. You're an impostor. A fucking impostor. One... two, three... four... five... I brought seven. Only five left. You put some in the other bag. What bag? - Yours. - My backpack? I take it off? If you want. We'll do your back after. Clench your fist. Stretch your arm. Here I go. Shall I do your back on the bed? I'm ok here. All right. ACT UP activists are chained to the Melton Pharm gates. The AIDS advocacy group is protesting against the lab for delaying anti-AIDS treatment to hospital pharmacies. We demand increased distribution of the new antiretroviral. Many patients have no access to it, even though it received authorization over a month ago. The AIDS advocacy groups accuse the lab of restricting supply of the new drug and of excluding terminal patients with less than 50 T4 cells... See you later. Melton Pharm has not reacted. Can I come in? Yes. How are you? Not great. The catheter caused an infection. They don't know what it is. - Are you in pain? - Yes. Mainly aches. I keep vomiting. What's the painkiller? Paracetamol, I think. - Nothing stronger? - No. Well, yes. They offered morphine. You accepted? Yes. I'd always go for morphine. Do you play a lot? What do the doctors say? Nothing specific yet. My T4s have increased a bit. That's good. It doesn't mean a thing. It's an improvement. Why have you come here? We don't like each other, but we're friends. For December 1st, I have a bad feeling. It'll be the worst World AIDS Day ever. No one will come. They have crazy ideas, like turning the Seine blood red, a condom on the obelisk... There'll be a party though. I'd like you to go now. You're always mad at me. Why? I don't know. But I'd like you to go. What are you doing? Put that out and get into bed. I'll be going. Good idea. What's his infection? Drop it. We'll find out. It's important. Don't give up, ok. Stop. We'll get new treatment. We're controlling infection for now. He's fine. If he's fine... I'll get everything for your IV. I'll go. What's up? Thibault's going. See you. See you. I've brought clean clothes. Thanks. It's hot in here. I guess. It's freezing outside. I'm not well. I know. I hurt all over. I don't know if it's the fever or fear. Or both. I'm afraid. I'm really afraid. All the time. And I miss you. Is the apartment nice? A mess, but we've finished painting. Is it beautiful? It's white. You jerk... Sorry it had to be you. Killer Mitterrand, you've blood on your hands! AIDS is a war, hear ACT UP roar! We view AIDS as a war. A war invisible to others. Our friends are dying. We don't want to die. Every war has its traitors. AIDS too. Those who see the epidemic as a godsend for killing gays, junkies, prostitutes and prisoners to general indifference. Those who use it to revive hatred and discrimination. We have been fighting them since 1989 through our tireless presence on every front. Together we can unite our forces to resist the epidemic, and the personal tragedies and social problems it causes. Together we can build a community able to approach the disease with a positive and combative attitude. ACT UP Paris views AIDS as a challenge! Take it up with us! Join us! Hello. The bed's ready in there. No, not in a bed. The living room then. You'd be better in bed. I'm better nowhere. Goodbye. I fetched your mail. I opened the official stuff. You've had your handicapped adult allowance. There's other stuff too. I'll put it there. Nathan! Get me out of here. Leave it open. You're sure? Yes. Is everything ready? Yes. Be careful. You mustn't prick yourself. Yes. I know. Good night. I'm not dead yet? What're you doing? I've had enough. We just turned the light off. Go to sleep. He's dead. He's dead! Damn... So soon... Can you spell his name, please? Sean... S-E-A-N. - Dalmazo. - Spelled? D-A-I-M-A-Z-O. His mum wants to dress him. I can't. Don't worry. I'll do it. Hello, ma'am. Hello, Max. Let me help you. Thank you. Can you lift him a bit? I'll hold him like this. I'll slip the shirt behind him. Hold him. Put him down now. Can you button it up? You have to help me, sweetheart. Nearly there. A bit more. Lovely. Hello, I'm Thibault. I'm Sean's mum. Come in. Hello. Do you want coffee? Yes... Thank you. I'll fetch it. Wait, let me help you. It's stuck? It was easy to get out, but I can't fold it. Careful. Mind if I smoke? No, open the window. It's good you're all here. Coffee? Got anything to eat? Dunno. Yes, I bought some things. Let me see... I have this... Thanks. I'm Sophie. Sophie. Is the coffee ready? We'll pour for them. Hello. You're Sean's mum. Yes. And you? I'm Hélène, Marco's mum. Hello, Hélène. Hello, Marco. Ok, Marco? Yeah, I just don't want to see the body. You don't have to. You don't mind? I'll go. Where is he? There, to the right. Hello, ma'am. Done the communiqué? I've written something, but it's a bit... It's like an obituary. I'd like to hear the communiqué. I'll read it? The title... "Sean Dalmazo, 26, has died of AIDS." Then, the lines... "Sean was a founder member of ACT UP Paris. He headed the prison commission." Then I wanted to add that... he worked on minor... on defending minorities, hookers, fags, junkies, etc. After that, "Sean lived politics in the first person." He was a queen, funny, "a badass, alive." I'd stopped there. If you have ideas... That's not bad. We could mention courage too. Maybe it's a bit naive. Courage is good. Emphatic doesn't scare ACT UP. Can we talk about the ashes? As you know, Sean wanted a political funeral. He wanted his ashes thrown over insurers. That raises an organizational question... How do we recover his ashes? I know about it. Nathan told me. Of course, it's what he wanted. But I'd like some of his ashes too. Are you thinking 50-50 or more like 40-60? More like 80-20. No more coffee? I'm making some. Call me when it's ready. Can you come back later? Sure. Why? To spend the night with me. Ok. Thanks. We'd fuck and everything? Yes, of course. Subtitles by Ian Burley
