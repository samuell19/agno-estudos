I'm not old, but I feel that way sometimes. As you get older, you kind of feel like the magic's gone, and the world tends to get a shade bluer with each year. Some people are OK with that progression, take it as it comes. They understand it. Some people try to move past it and evolve with the passing years, quietly submitting and trying to look beyond. Some people let it break them. And when they're broke, there's no fixing. How was it? Not good. Are you sure? I'm sure. If there's anything you need, I'll be here just watching a little TV. Thanks. Hey, what's up with your shirt? What? Get a different shirt on. Since when did you start paying attention to what I wear? I don't know. Just, I notice those things. Worry about your own wardrobe, not mine. Baby, remember on the bus and my hand was on your knee. When you love somebody, it's hard to think about anything but to breathe. Baby, I am the cub who was washed out in the flood. When you love somebody, bite your tongue. All you get is a mouthful of blood. OK. Hey, hey. What's up. Let's get the hell out of here. These lights are making me feel mental. Here, let me take that. Thanks, man. - You look like a piece of shit. - Thanks. I feel like a six pack at a construction, saying. Did you talk to your bitch since you landed? Don't start with this shit. Did you? She's not a bitch. Oh, I'm sorry. Did you talk to your princess since you landed? Yeah, I called her before I left. No answer. Hey, what was that movie we watched in high school, you know? Um, the fuck was that movie? it was about... it had Mormons and stunt cocks in it. Oh, "Orgasmo." Yes. "Orgasmo." You're like the bad guy in "Orgasmo," Neutered Man. Just a new Billy. You know, it is so nice to have a sympathetic ear close by. Stan, thank you. Thank you for that. Feel like going out later? If Alice calls. If she does, it'll kind of set the bar, you know. Billy. - See you, man. - Hey. Thanks, see you. Hey. How was your flight? Oh, it was an anxiety attack from start to finish. Barbie, how's Ken? Billy, I told you, that's not funny anymore. Well, I always think it's funny. Here, let me get that. The only reason I even notice time is you guys, you kids. Other than that, I don't notice getting any older. I don't know about that, you guys are starting to look like prunes to me. Thanks, pal. Prunes? Well, not you, mom. You look maybe a year or two out of college. Oh, good save. Hey, with age comes wisdom. Isn't he a knucklehead? You are a knucklehead. Isn't he? I should answer this real quick. I'll be right back. It's Alice, Tom, let him take it. Hey. Hi, I saw you called. Yeah, yeah, I did. I just wanted to see how you're doing, you know, how you're feeling? I'm good, there's nothing to report. Come on, Alice, I just need to balance things out a bit. And so moving out of the state constitutes balance? You know... I just want to see where I'm at. Well, you're not here. You know, I can't do this, I can't talk like this. You know, we just, we shouldn't, I don't think we should talk. Well, I need to, OK? I need to right now. Your voice it reminds me that I'm breathing. Stop. It was in your hands. OK, listen, we can not talk for now. We can... just please, give it a chance, give it a second, all right? I'm not officially moved out of the state yet. I can come back. OK, maybe if you come back and then we can talk in person. But I told you before, this whole phone thing, I can't do it. I just... it's just not me. Shit, Billy, this fucks up my whole week. I've got school, and I just... Alice, please, please just hear me out. Billy, are you OK? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I want a baby. Just a little time, when I'm 1,000. You make me sound like I'm going to lay a spider egg, and we're going to have them everywhere, making webs on our bed, crawling all over you, saying, daddy, take care of me. Well, maybe four then, I could do four. Four's doable. You think you can handle 36 months of pregnancy? Hmm, OK, maybe two, I could do two. So 18 months? Yeah. All right, off your ass, baby mama. I can feel you obsessing. I can't stop. You can, trust me, you can. My memories have become like answering machine messages, just looping repeatedly in my head. I just play them over, and over, and over again. It sucks. It's totally unintentional. That's what it's like. They split your skull, worm their way into your brain, making extraction impossible. She's probably finger fucking herself knowing you can't stop romanticizing your time together. This isn't helping, Stan. I have to go the bathroom. Well, it helps me. What about me, huh? I mean I don't fucking know. It's what women are and what they do, period. She's a good girl at heart. At heart? She's selfish. They're all selfish. You told me she was a selfish bitch. They're all worthless. What about Ashley? Seriously, don't say that name. Why? I said don't. Hey, what the fuck, man. Don't fucking touch me, be an adult. I mean it. OK, I'm sorry. Fuck, Stan, I'm just saying, you know, people are people. There's no one way to see them. Everybody's got their shit shuffled differently. No, women run everything. They do not. Us, the world, for every dictator, there's a woman twisting the life out of his helpless sack, barking orders. That's bullshit and you know it. Do I? You do. Women, you know, women can make you feel like you're not just a dot on the map. I'd rather take a Norwegian fist pie than be emotionally dependent again. Is that like an Abe Lincoln? It's closer to a donkey punch. It's when you're fucking a girl and you pull out abrupt because you're about to blow... I think I've heard enough of these to know where this is going. You think? I know a girl, that's for sure. Oh, fuck. What? I pissed on my shoe. I need to concentrate. It's just like heaven, being here with you. You're like an angel, too good to be true. Simge... And you two are depressing to look at. I broke up with my girlfriend. Oh, how long? Five years. Sorry to hear that. What's your excuse, Lite-Brite? Fuck off, Simge. No, I'm talking to Billy. He has no interest in speaking with you. Stan, yes, I do, relax. Well, I don't. I can see Ashley has been hard at work again. What the fuck, man. Is there something in your tiny brain that rejects my request for you to leave. Oh, it is Ashley. Ashley did something to you. That girl brings out the worst every time. I can see her in your eyes. Simge, this isn't the best time. Take a hint, bitch. You can't lump all women together because you're a doormat. I'm not Ashley. You have a slit between your legs. Stan, that's enough And you're about to have one too if you don't shut your fucking mouth. It's a fucking joke. Is it? You know, work on your attitude and then maybe I'll accept your apology later. I'll catch up with you later, when you're not with this cocksucker. I'm going to tell you right now, this isn't working for me, OK? I can't help how I am. This isn't you. It's me now. Down to the bones, it's me now. Well, it's making my situation a whole lot harder. That's the truth, Stan. It's making it a lot harder. OK. I'll take you home. I'll take you home. Ooh, I do. No one else will love you like I do. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Please let... Seriously, don't bring that up. Don't. Stupid bitch. Jesus. Like a hostage tied in chains. I could not forget your name. Destroy she said my love again, the end will come quickly. Don't try again to make amends, you'll just end up sinking. If you explode in aftermath, don't think you've been dreaming. Destroy she said my love again, when it's not worth keeping. Like a helicopter crash, Like a ghetto that's been smashed. Fuck, what? I don't care, what you want? It's 2:00 a.m., I'm drunk and I'm not coming over. You knew I went out. That's why you're calling about me. No. Why don't you go fuck your little Menessa slut. Yes, you did sleep with her. Sarah told me that you screwed her in the... well, that's what Sarah said, and I believe her. You did not just say that. You know what, I think my phone's dying, I'm sorry, uh, beep, beep, beep. Bye-bye. Why is this so much fun? My feet are the side of your head. They're dainty and graceful. Didn't you know? I did. Come here. - Hey. - Hey, Stan called. Yeah, what'd he say? He said that he wants you to stop by the store later, said you need to talk, or he needed to talk to you. Yeah, he kind of caught me off guard last night. He was acting like a royal asshole. He said to say he's sorry about that too. Is there a reason he didn't leave this on my cell? He didn't say. But he sounded kind of uneven. He didn't joke around with me like he usually does. Just sounded like a straight line. Don't look at me like that, Billy. Like what? You want even talk to me. You don't even know how to talk to me. I dated you for five fucking years, Alice. I spent days and nights quieting, counseling, endless conflicts. OK, I know how to talk to you. So you've just given up? I don't know what else to do. Oh, shit, sorry. Hey, Stan. Knock. What? Knock next time. Do we have any more of the alpine 9987's? No. Shit. It's just we got this easy kill out here. What do we have? Sell him a Sony. Oh, man, everybody knows Sony makes shit. So sell him a Sony. Do you work here or do you work here? So, so, I think, I think this looks good. I mean Alpine, Alpine's, Alpine's good, right? I just talked to my manager, he's been yanking those bad boys out all month. Well, I'm glad you went, I'm glad you went back there then, that's good. No definitely, I mean, I'm glad too. Let me show you something else. Ever since the last time I saw Ashley, he's just been flat. They've been broken up for months. Yeah, I know. When he out with her, he didn't give any details, he just left. Did they fight? I don't know. I'm really sorry to hear about what happened between your girl. You were up and out of Ohio pretty fast. Probably what I would do if that happened to me. Any women in you life? My luck in that department's minimal. I just don't know what to say. It's not about what you say, man. You need a change of wardrobe. Well, my mom sends me this stuff. Tell her to stop. Christian made a pretty good sale. I've taught him well. I can see that. So tell me something, what is this shit? What shit? This shit, all this, this whole attitude. That did Ashley do to you? What did I say about mentioning her name? Why can't I mention it? I know her too, OK? You dated her for five goddamn years. She's part of my personal history too. She's part of history, which is where I would like her to remain. So I will ask you again, please, don't mention her. We're fucking friends, Stan. You hear me? We're friends. I hear you. So you can tell me if there's something I need to know. And I will tell you if there is something that you need to know. - All right, fine. Hey, like stop. You know what, I can't even fucking talk to you right now. What if something happened to Alice? What did you say? If something happened to Alice. Would you be heartbroken? Or would you feel forced to move on? Are you out of your motherfucking mind? Just answer the question. No, I'm not going to answer it. This is crazy. She's in fucking school, Stan. She's not in the Middle East. Her environment is more than sound. She's fine. I'm just trying to lend a hand. I came here because I thought we could talk, like friends do. I think... is the Italian sub any good? Do you like Italian subs? Usually. Then, yeah, it's good. OK, I'll take that and a medium drink. Great. And so the search begins for a young woman of 24. Her name is Ashley Detwiler. And she has not been seen for almost two days. Sources say the last person to see her with a coworker, when she left her office at the end of the day. Angela Reynolds reporting, Fairfax, Virginia. So let me get this straight, you think that you could actually kill somebody in cold blood. Is bird shit off-yellow? No, you can't. You are full of shit. Probably. You think in middle school those Columbine kids knew they were going to massacre the student body? I don't think so. They were probably just normal kids who watched Power Rangers and TV, when they played actual music, that is. I know, right. I mean, if someone isn't born, and I'll insert opinion saying I don't think anyone is, but if someone isn't born a killer, like how do they reach that point? You know, how does... I mean, what happens, you know? I don't know, a subconscious rip, animalistic rage, who really knows? I just think if you can get there, you get to that point, you know? Most people don't, but if you do, you do. Fuck, I don't know. Let's set up some beer pong. Teams? Yeah. I can't do this right now, Alice. Look, I may be mad or we may not be talking, but I'm here, I'm here to help if need me. I'm just not so sure that you're the most important thing on my mind right now. I mean, I care, obviously, regardless of anything. But I can barely move. Call me. I don't think... Billy, call me. Hey, you've reached Alice's cell phone, leave me a message. Alice, never mind. I shouldn't have called you right now, I'm sorry. Oh, man, I can't believe how bad I railed that customer today. A Sony. That guy had no idea. Well, you learned from the best. Yeah. I will say, you're the best salesman I've ever seen. But you have to admit, I'm all right. Yeah, you're all right. So what exactly were you saying to Billy earlier. You sure seemed to have gotten him going. I didn't get him going. I mean, we were just talking about you. What'd you too hose bags have to exchange about me? What? What kind of way is that to refer to your friends. We're your boys, Stan. We talk because we care about you. You talk because you have nothing else to talk about. No, we don't. If you want me to say it, fine, I'll come right out and say it. Where's your blue shirt? My what? The blue shirt you wore see Ashley? Just get in the car, Christian. No, there's got to be a reason that you don't want to talk about this. Why? Tell me this grand significance. Why do I need a reason? People just don't change clothes after they go out. - It's weird. - It's not. Yes it is. It's not. It is not. The blue wasn't cutting it, so I went with black. All right? I keep an extra one of my trunk in case I want to go someplace after hockey. Is that OK with you? - Yeah. Is that a fucking problem with you if I change my shirt, Christian? No. Now, if you don't get in the car right now, we're going to have a big fucking problem. Are you listening to me? Listen, I understand. Just shut the fuck up for one second. OK? I'm trying to say something to you. Now I'm going to give you to five to get in the car. What? Stanley, man. What's going on with you? Did something happen and you don't want me... Your mother and I would were watching the news. Did you... Yeah, I saw. Earlier today, I saw. Has Stanley seen her lately? I don't know. He doesn't really want to talk about it. Well, as you well know, breakups involve a great deal of pain and confusion. Well, shit, though, look... I've said it, my father said it to me, if it's meant to be, love will find a way. And if it's not, there's a half a world of women out there waiting for Billy Klepack. Thanks, dad. Of course, when my dad said to me, he said Tommy Klepack. But you know, all the same. It's a real hard thing, aligning yourself with someone for the long run, harder than one would think. Get up. Hey, get your ass up. Christian, you OK? Oh, stop hitting me, man. Where's the store? Off of Interstate 95 where it's always been. I'm gonna grab a paper towel. What is that, Palmolive? Yes. I have Bactine in my room, dude. My mom loves the anti-bacteria, let me clean your cut. Be still. What happened? - Look at your shoelace. No way. There's no way I tripped on my own shoelace. Don' by so hard on yourself. It's a common joke because it happens. You didn't take me to the hospital. That's an asshole move. Do it yourself. I'm the one cleaning a wound in my head with dish soap. I should be mad. Yeah. Hey, listen, why didn't you tell me about Ashley? I'm not telling you again, friend. Why, why is she missing, Stan? You know, two days after you met her, she's missing? What is that? I'm going to Vegas tomorrow. Stan, did you talk to her? To the police? To her family? Vegas, or a trade show, my job. Oh, my god, you're fucking making me feel crazy here, Stan. Do you think you're crazy? No, I'm, I'm... Like she might have made you feel crazy? No, Stan, you are doing it, OK? You won't tell me what happened, how the conversation went, how it concluded. I don't give a Christ fuck about your traveling or any other bullshit throw-away conversation you want to bring up, OK? I want to know what happened to Ashley now. Do you think you might be projecting your worries onto me? I mean, you were quick to come back here. Maybe you were glad to be out. Maybe you didn't love her. No, I did love Alice, Stan. I loved Alice very much. Maybe you didn't. You sure jetted quick when things got rocky. You can damn well bet I didn't do that with Ashley. All right, dude, listen, we all make rash decisions, OK? Did you make one that I should know about? Did you? Maybe. I don't know. Hi, there. I have a flight leaving in an hour and 45 minutes. Can I get my ticket? Yes, sir, of course. Name, sir? Stanley Harold Keller. Here you go. Just give me a minute to look you up, Mr. Keller. I can help you out. Gladly. So do some kind of meeting in Cleveland? Business or pleasure? Oh, just assessing a situation, drawing conclusions, weighing options. Oh, you're in insurance claims. Oh, yeah, in certain respects. Thank you. Billy, hey, how goes it. Sam, hey. Needed a break from Ohio? Oh, yeah, you know Alice I, we broke up. That's tough, man. I was wondering if you could tell me when Stan might be back. Well, that's a good question, and I don't know. What do you mean? Well, he didn't show up today. He's in Vegas, though. He is? At the trade show. That's news to me. There's no trade show? If there was, I would be there. And Stan would have his tuckus parked, right here, clipboard in hand. Thanks. Oh, hey, if you hear from Christian, tell him he's going to be knee deep in it if he doesn't give me a call pronto. Was he supposed to work today? Yeah, no call, no show. Normally, he's prompt, but not today. Christian. Jesus Christ, hey, Christian, Christian, wake up. Christian, wake up. - Leave me alone, Stan. No, wake up, wake the fuck up, dude. It's not Stan, it's Billy. Look your goddamn pillow. Hey, look at your pillow. God, I feel like I'm standing with my eyes closed. With Stanley? With everything, with Stan, with Alice, you know, just I'm fucked. I just feel fucked. We'll figure things out with Stan. But I really think you should call Alice. No, if I call her, can just going to make things worse. No, it won't. Yes it will. I me and I know that it will. You can't compare her situation with what's going on with Stan. They're different. He just makes me feel like I tripped up somewhere along the way, you know? Like, I don't want to be like him. I don't want to feel what he's feeling. You're not like Stan. Yeah, I know that. I know. But hurt can affect people in strange ways. And I see Stan, and I'm afraid of what I might become. He can't even see five feet in front of him now. That's not you. I love the guy, but he's got tunnel vision. I see is hurt, I feel it, I understand it. Where is he? Where the fuck is he? Somewhere I'm not sure he can come back from. Excuse me? Yes. - Hi, there. - Hey. I'm sort of lost. I was wondering if I could borrow you for a second. Sure. Well, I'm looking for the psychology building. I graduated about a half a decade ago. I just, I don't know, it just seems like everything has changed and relocated every couple of years. What year did you graduate? 2002. Did you have Grenier? I think so. Yeah, I kind of felt like I was swimming in the wrong pond, if you catch my drift. I mean, I was younger and bar life seemed more appealing. Yeah, he definitely sounds familiar though. She, she sounds familiar. Yeah, she. You gonna help me out? Or do your second year psychology classes give you some sort of heightened awareness that prevents you from pointing your finger? Yeah, the building's over there. That wasn't so hard. All right, man, I'm going to grab Barbie, I'll swing back by. Sounds good. Hey. Vegas is warm. How's the trade show? Alpine's got some great decks coming out next year. I know you're not in Vegas, Stan. Do you? I talked to Sam. I say I am. Sam's got to get his head straight. Sam's not the one you need to worry about. Is that so? Yeah, it is, and when you get back, we need to talk, Stan. Well, I'll be back soon. It's pretty quite for a trade show. What, are you outside? Everyone needs to catch a breath of fresh air. Maybe you need one. Quit talking to me in code. Communicate motherfucker. Why I got to be a motherfucker? Because I care about my boys? What are you talking about? My boys, you guys. What happened to Christian's head? Am I a motherfucker because I care? I said what happened to Christian's head. Why am I spending my afternoons getting Christian fucking stitches, Stan? He's getting stitches, fuck. If you think I'm going to believe that shoelace bullshit, you are crazier than I thought. Oh so now I'm a motherfucker and I'm crazy. Stan. I think I'm going to have to let you go. Hey. Hop in. Billy, you're silly. I can walk home. Mom told me to pick you up, pooper, so I'm picking you up. You look morose, Billy. Morose? Bigger vocabulary than I do. Is that bi... girl being mean to you? No, it's not always that simple. What is it? You can ramble on about it, but do you have some cartoons or something that you could catch up on? I Tevo them anyway. You wouldn't understand this, OK? You're in elementary school. Mom and dad don't even know how to use Tevo. I do. I don't know. When you get older, after high school and college, if you go, you start to kind of have an idea of how things need to be. It's part age, and part how you were raised. But you want to feel like your life is set, that your friends' lives are set. They're going to be happy. And things don't turn out the way you want. They're just far worse than you hoped and then you feel like your future is nonexistent. And these dreams of cookouts with your friends, dinner parties, they just fade away. It's like a future that was never there. The fact is, by my age, you start to see that people are just really sad and that there's nothing you can do about it. Is Stan sad? What do you mean? Mom says that his ex-girlfriend is missing. Did she... I don't know, I don't know about Stan. Here let me take this in. I can take it. OK. Hey, Barbie, let's keep this conversation brother-BARBIE, OK? Yeah, OK. No Ken either. Ken's plastic, Billy, he wouldn't understand English. Silly me. Hey, man, you ready to go? Are you sure you don't want to try and pick it? You a locksmith? No. Neither am I. Holy shit, Alice. Stanley? Oh, my god, it's been years. Yeah. Hi. Yeah, it has, hi. What are you doing here on campus? I don't... Well, MB Court has a base here in town. I don't know that it is. Speaking company, car audio, yeah, so I'm just checking out the new line, I guess. Always on the move. Did you travel alone, or, did Billy come with you? No, no, no, just me, it's purely business. So you mind if I asked what happened with him? Billy? Yeah, yeah, fill me in. Billy's not much of a talker these days, I guess you could say. Let's just look around. If you see anything weird, just point it out. We just weren't aligned anymore. He wanted to be a writer. I was into politics. Doesn't sound like a deal breaker. No, it wasn't. I just felt like he wanted out. So I initiated it. Yeah, women usually do. Huh? Oh, nothing, it's just, you know, women kind of make the first move, you know? No, I just mean women are more empowered these days, which is good. It's good, they're making the moves that men used to make, you know? Yeah, I guess. I just, I feel like you only live once, you know, and I'm always going to love Billy, but I'm not going to keep loving someone who doesn't love me back. I understand that. I understand that. So the books are closed on old Billy Boy, huh? Yeah. I can't do it anymore. I guess that's right. He's got friends like you, you know, he's got good solid friends that are there for him. More than I can say. God, You're the hottest woman on campus. Hi This is Billy's friend, Stan. Awesome, it's totally cool to meet you, bro. Would you guys have any interest in going on a hike? Yeah, that sounds rocking, man. Yeah. I don't have any, I mean, I don't know anyone around here. So, I figured, you know, it might be nice to see what calming secluded places this state has to offer. Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn. Nice. Yeah, man, we'll catch the sunset from stellar ground. Can you leave in an hour? Oh, yeah, so... Maybe, maybe he beat the shit out her, you know. He beat her up really bad. Bad slap, he gets some blood on his hand, you know. It could be a number of things. No. I don't think so. Maybe it's his blood. Actually, she was, she was feisty as hell, you know that. Listen to what you just said. What? Was, you just that Ashley was. And you know what he did. All the denial aside, we know what he did. There has to be some feasible explanation for this. Yeah, there is Billy. You just refuse to acknowledge it. Look at it. Just take it. Will you take it? That's blood. Yeah. There's blood fingerprints all over that photo. I know, but it doesn't... it doesn't necessarily mean that. No, listen to me, man. I'm assuming whatever happened that night, Stan wasn't holding that picture when it happened. He was holding it afterwards. And even after whatever happened , enough blood remained for him to stain an entire picture. No fucking way, he wouldn't do that. He would not do that. Stan loved her. And since you saw that news story, Billy, you knew what he did. Goddamn-it, you know. There's no other out for this. There's no other explanation, Billy. That's what it is. Let's just, let's just take a minute No, here, are you aware... Can we take a minute, please, and just think for a second? Hey, you ready to go? Yeah, it's going to be a little awkward, but, yeah, let's just go. Do you want to get your phone? Nah, it's OK, let's just go. Hi, you've reached Alice's cell phone, leave a message after the tone and I'll get back to you, thanks. Hey, Haas, it's me. I know you need some time. I just, I really want to talk to you right now. You know, it doesn't need to involve us. I know there isn't an us, I know that, you know. I don't have anyone outside of where I am to talk to, and I don't know, I don't know, maybe it is, maybe it was about us. If you could just hear me out, you know. If you can... I just, I don't want to lose you for good, you know. I'm sorry, all right? I am. I'm, I'm really sorry. If you could please just call me back. I'll be here, I'll be here. OK. We need to go check out Mason's neck? But how do you know? Cause I know him. When the water is coming up the trail, it's great. It's terrific. Hey you, are you all right? - Why? - Look at your leg. It's bleeding. Oh, that? That's nothing. No, no, you're really bleeding. I'm a mountain man. I used to play soccer too. I don't even notice. I'm fine. Really, I have first aid in the car. Oh, I feel a little sick. Mmm, it doesn't get any easier. These, these permanent. You'd think it would, but it doesn't. No, I'm OK. Thanks. Oh, fucking not! It's fucking gone! It's fucking gone! God, fuck. You sure this is where they came. I said no. Yeah, but it's where they could have come? Yes. Everybody has a place. This was theirs. Pull over right over here. So where would it be? Point it out. I think it was right in that opening up there. Well, if not now, never, right? Yeah. Oh, no. - It's... - Why? What? I can't do this alone, Christian. It's her. It's her. Oh, oh, god, it's her. Go over there, just talk to them. You do it. I'm not, I'm not... I'm not going to go. He's not going to go. ...feeling it right now. - Christian, you do it. - It's gotta be you, dude. Man, I can't. Just, just, open the door for us, we'll come in there and do the rest. That's not going to happen. There's no way that's going to happen. I can't, I can't do it, because she's been looking at you. You think so? I think so. Wow. Come one, you're the best looking one. Oh, shut up. You got to go. OK. I can be your ground support, but I'm no special ops man. All right. Ground support, I'm fucking going in right now. - Right, do it. - I can do it. Stop, don't make me laugh. Hello... Hello. I'm Stan. Kelly, nice to meet you, Stan. Kelly, nice to meet you. What would your name be? I'm kind of a germaphobe. I mean, if you know me, it's different, but... Oh yeah. And last, but certainly not least, we have... Ashley. Ashley, it's very nice to meet you... it's very nice to meet you, Stan. OK, excellent. Me and my friends, the guys over there, we were just looking for some nice young ladies to keep us company. You make us sound like hookers. Oh, no, I didn't... I'm fucking with you. I'm just fucking with you. Yeah, no, I mean, I could tell. It's just... yeah. So you game? I make a wicked beer pong partner, seriously. Is that so? Yeah. Well, unfortunately, I only play with my girls as my teammates. You ready to get squashed? Oh, we'll have to see about that. OK. Yeah. You girls can really play. I wasn't lying to you, kid. Wait, wait, how old are you again? 19. Yeah, well, I'm 20, and I say you can't call me kid cause I'm older. Is that so? Yeah, yeah. Well, I always make the rules. - Oh, do you now? - Mm hmm. Interesting. The important rules. Look, I don't know who you think you are... What do you mean? But I don't know if that's going to work for me, you know? That, that works for me. We have to call the police. We will. I think we should now. We will, I promise. I just don't know what to think even if I need to think. Sometimes, things are what they are, you know? She had a ring. It destroyed his entire world. I don't think I could ever kill anybody, especially if it was someone that I loved that much, as much as he loved her. I don't you know if you can until it happens. People don't plan these things, killing someone you care so much about. Should I call you when he gets back? Yeah, if he gets home in the next few hours I guess, but I doubt he will. I'm just going to hit the couch. Yeah, I know this is all hard to process, you know. My days are gliding swiftly by. And I, a pilgrim stranger, would not detain them as they fly, those hours of toil and danger. For now we stand on Jordan's strand, our friends are passing over... Lose something? Stanley, when did you get back? An hour ago. Oh, yeah, that's cool. Why are you so nervous? I'm not. It's just I lost something, something my grandma gave me. A trinket from your grandma? Yeah it was a little necklace chain. I bent over and it popped of. How do you lose a necklace chain when you don't wear a necklace? No, it was in my pocket, I just got it. Your grandma's been dead. So if your grandma's been dead, how did she manage to give you a fucking necklace chain? I don't, I don't know. You're lying to your best friend's face. Please, Stanley, let me call you some help, man. No. Stanley, I'm going to call you some help. No. there's glory on the morrow. For now we stand on Jordan's strand, our friends are passing over, and just before the shining shore, we may almost discover. Christian. Hey, no, no, no, no, no. no, no... Christian, fuck. No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't... Stop. Billy? Just stop. Stop. I didn't try. You didn't try? No, it just happened. Seems like there's been a lot of stuff that's been just happening lately with you, Stan. It has. What am I gonna do? What do we do? There's no way. There's no way, OK? There hasn't been one since you killed Ashley. All right, there Hasn't been one since, since I got back here. Fuck, Christian? How could you, man? I didn't want to. I, I did, but I didn't want to kill Ashley. I loved her with all of my heart. This isn't doing anything for me, Stan. Just hear me out, Ashley, that's all I'm asking. This is our spot, and there is no us, don't you understand? Just come with me, all right? Come on. This just isn't fair. How? This isn't fair to me. What if John saw us here Stan? Huh? What if he saw us coming here? I'll fucking kick his ass. Now what requires this backdrop? Why drag me out here? Don't be like that. Be like what, you dragged me out here. Come on, Ashley, I'm trying to extend myself a bit here. It's a little late, friend. Don't call me that. Why, you're my friend at best, Stanley, and I'm not even sure you can handle that. I have something that I want to ask you, but I need you to just hear me out, OK? OK. OK. Oh, shit I left it in the car. What, you left what the car? Nothing, it's just... Just give me a second. I just, I got, I got all mixed up, you know, like my mind is all mixed up. Don't justify. There, on the table, is an envelope. Take it. Stop, don't, don't look inside of it. I want to say something to you. What? I want to tell you something, OK? I want you to kill me. I need to die. I'm not going to kill you. No, you don't understand. I put that there so you could have closure. I did sick things. Sick things, unforgivable, which is why it's only fair that you, that you kill me. I felt like I was you. I feel like I was you, and I was protective. I thought I was protecting you. I thought... What does this mean? I told you, my heart, I wanted to talk to you for you. I thought, I thought, I thought I could fix what... What does this mean? I'm sorry, Billy, I didn't want to do it. I saw the ring in her eye. You saw the fucking ring in her eye. What the fuck does that mean, huh? She didn't love you anymore, Billy. I checked. How did you check? How did you fucking check? Huh? How did you check? Stanley? How did you fucking check? She told me. There's no way to justify the decisions being lost brings. A single moment can unbalance. A single choice can destroy. But it's experience that makes us who we are. And how we process pain that defines us. It's just like heaven, being here with you. You're like an angel, too good to be true. But after all, I love you, I do. Angel baby, my angel baby. When you are near me, my heart skips a beat. I can hardly stand on my own two feet. Because I love you, I love you, I do. Angel baby, my angel baby. Whoo hoo, I love you, whoo hoo, I do. No one could love you like I do. Ooh, whoo-hoo-hoo. Please never leave me blue and alone. If you ever go, I'm sure you'll come back home. Because I love you, I love you, I do. Angel baby, my angel baby. Whoo hoo, I love you, whoo hoo, I do. No one could love you like I do. whoo-hoo-hoo, whoo-hoo-hoo, whoo-hoo-hoo. Whoo-hoo-hoo, whoo hoo, whoo-hoo-hoo.
