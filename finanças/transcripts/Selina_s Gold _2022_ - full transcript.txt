According to newspaper reports... ...American forces and the Japanese Imperial forces in Tokyo... ...claim that Bataan peninsula defense forces are still resisting. But all the resistance will be for naught... ...as it is expected to collapse with the continuous attacks... ...by the Japanese forces. However, Washington communique said that... ...24 hours of continuous artillery fire by American and Philippine forces... ...have proven more superior to the Japanese as their tanks... ...armored units, and infantry concentrations have been shattered... ...and dispersed resulting to heavy losses... ...on the Japanese side. The Japanese headquarters in Manila... ...have issued a proclamation strongly warning that... ...the death penalty awaits inhabitants who resort to rebellious acts that... ...counter the security of the Japanese forces. 1942, NORTHERN LUZON, PHILIPPINES Stop whining. You're going to get it! Quickly. Come on. Stop resisting. Let's go. No! I don't want to! Keep up, or I'll hit you. Berong, stop by for a moment. When I return, I will be able to pay you. That's good. You will finally have some money, and then I can borrow from you. I'll give you a share. Berong! I don't mean to pry, but-- Good. Don't pry. Everyone knows how Tiago is. Miling! Thank you. Tiago's going to have fun again. So much fun. According to reports, as attacks continue on the island of Luzon... ...resulting in a huge loss to infrastructures, properties and lives. A daring raid was executed on Japanese ships embarked in Subic Bay. Father. Don't, please. That ring costs thrice the amount. If you could add a bit more, Tiago. If you don't like my offer. You can have your paltry piece of gold back. My grandmother passed on that ring to my mother. You greedy pig. May you be cursed with bad luck. Leave that man before his evil rubs off on you. Older women... ...bereft of beauty... ...shouldn't dare to hope. They'll just end up being hurt. You're right, Tiago. They have to accept that... ...out of all the things men give importance to... ...they rank the lowest. Father. Selina is smooth. No scars. Smells like young rice. Her pubic hair is thin and sparse... Not yet as thick as a jungle. How old are you? Kid, how old are you? From now on, I own you. When I ask you a question, you must answer with fear... ...and respect. You will do what I say. I am not of your blood. I am not your friend. You are my property. How old are you? I am 17, sir. Take off your clothes. Everything! Don't crouch. I want to see your body. Don't cover your breast. Pour water on yourself. I want to see your body getting wet. Soap your breasts. Soap everything, including your nipples. Soap your navel. Wash your groin, and the lips of your pussy. Now your thigh... then your legs. Everything that my tongue will run through should be clean. They say you're still a virgin. Do you know the feeling of a hard cock... ...being pressed between your swollen breasts? I'm sure, once I shove my cock into your pussy... ...you'll get hurt. That's what turns me on. Virgins are delicious. Pour more water. More. More, pour some more. Tiago is lucky. Aside from being powerful... He has plenty of gold and money. He needs to be careful, though. He might be blinded by his wealth. You're too serious. Drink it sip by sip. Men are fools. How long will you make me wait? If I force you, you'll move away. If I get angry, I'll hit you. Please have mercy on me. You can fight back, but it's useless. Don't make this any more difficult. Come here. I said come here! I spent many years raising Selina. As you should. She is your child. It's only right that I gain something from her. But not that way. Miling, shut up. Berong, I understand you. You got buried in debt. I've paid back that son of a bitch. You paid him back with your own blood. I told you to shut up. Why are you butting in on the affairs of men? Since when did you give your barren wife the right to talk? You smell nice, fresh from your bath. Yes. Suck it, Suck it. Suck it, Suck it. Learn how to suckle. You smell so good. Flattened rice is delicious. Do you feel my hard cock inside your vagina? Do you feel my huge cock? Is my cock huge? Answer me. Say it louder. Answer me. Do I have a huge cock? Your cock is huge. Louder. Stop stammering! It's huge. - More. - It's huge. - More. - It's huge. Your cock is huge. Does my cock feel good inside your pussy? Well? Your cock feels so good inside my pussy. Tell me you need my cock. Tell me you need my cock. I need your cock. Tell me to go faster. Faster. Faster. I'm coming. Domeng, milk. Domeng. Give me milk, Domeng. Were you able to relieve yourself? Was she fast? I heard her footsteps. Her pace was quick. What will happen? She'll come back. They all come back in the end. One more. Carabao's milk is good for your health... ...a glass each after you wake up and before bed. Father, Father. Father. Take me away from him. Father. Father, he is not human. He is a monster. He's a monster. Father. You stupid bitch. You stupid bitch. You woke me up. Father. Father, I will do anything. Anything. Please just take me away from Tiago. Father. I can't be with him. He is evil. Have mercy. I beg you. You belong to him now. Father. You belong to him now. - Have mercy. - He is your father now. He is your father now. Leave! No, please. Father. Father. Father. Were you waiting for me? Did he adopt you, or are you his slave? How did you get here? Idiot. Why didn't you store the chickens in the coop? I'm sorry, father. Fool. The rats feasted on the chickens. I'm sorry. It won't happen again. Stop jacking off... ...so you have time for work. Selina. Come closer. Come here for a bit. Closer. Closer to me. Closer. Delicious. Next time, when you're inside the house... Don't use underwear. Make it easy on my fingers. Go on. Sit down and join me. Domeng. Don't sit there, join us. Leave him alone. Thank you. Milk truly is healthy in the morning. Come closer. Come closer. Press your body against the table. Closer. Closer. Your underwear is getting in the way. Father and I are not related by blood. Like you, I was used as payment for my parents debt. I was just seven years old. I owe him a debt of gratitude. I have some business with Tiago. Just go upstairs, ma'am. This is of poor quality. That should be enough. Tiago... please, add a little more. I don't want to hear groveling. Please loan us some more. Cora, my daughter... she's still unresponsive. I don't care about your daughter. You used her for payment and then took her back... ...now you want to borrow money again? How would you pay me back? Do you have another young daughter? Here. I wouldn't want you to think that I'm so heartless. That's the last time. You're all useless. Get out. Your family owes me a lot. I don't know what vices your father had that it ruined his livelihood. Your mother-- what a pity. She was kind and hardworking. Marrying a powerless man was her downfall. Power does not come from muscles or brawn. Nor from having the gift of gab. It is not from a kind heart that gives generously to all. Power comes from money. Not from family, but money. Not from camaraderie, but money. Every relationship has a price. Even the most principled can be bought with the right price. Things you thought you couldn't bear to lay your eyes on... ...because they are unsightly and foul smelling... ...you will endure for money. Did you want to say something? My father told me that I'm now your property. Is that truly what you think of me? Shouldn't I? Every time we have sex... ...every time you moan, or contort your face, out of sheer pleasure... ...donâ€™t those carry any feelings for me? Do you want me to say... ...that I have feelings for you? It's so good. Don't stop. Suck it. Bite it. Your cock feels so good. Your cock huge. - Your cock feels so good. - Louder. It's so good. It's so good. Deeper. Deeper. News reports state that the Philippine Island of Corregidor... ...was surrounded by Japanese forces... ...General Douglas MacArthur and his family made a daring escape on board PT boats... ...braving the stormy seas patrolled by Japanese warships. Upon orders of President Franklin D. Roosevelt... ...the General was commanded to flee to Australia via a submarine... ...made available to him but General MacArthur... ...the symbol of Allied resistance to the Japanese made the escape via PT boats... ...led by lieutenant junior grade John D. Bulkeley. Additional reports said that General MacArthur... ...reached Mindanao two days later... ...and he and his group flew to Australia on board B27 flying fortresses. The recent fall of Singapore, once considered impregnable... ...dictated the fate of the American-British... ...Dutch-Australian command. Tiago. Drop by for a bit. We're just about to start. What is all the fuss? And you're bothering me on the way home? Coconut wine. Coconut wine? It doesn't look like you're worried over the warning... ...that the Japanese are nearing the capitol. I was there during the time of the Spaniards. I've clinked glasses with the Americans. How different are these Japanese? They say the Japanese are ruthless, which is why we should leave. Bino... ...won't you listen to your wife? You seem to have changed. Your demeanor is lighter. Is that a smile on your face? You talk too much. You're better off pouring me a glass. Selina, do you want water? Looks like you did a lot of shopping. None of which are for him. You are playing with fire. Be careful. Thank you, ma'am. I'll be careful. Don't let your guard down. Remember Magda's daughter? She went insane. So have I. Don't leave the house. Father. Please, stop. Stop it. Remember this... Do not leave the house. Mother... Stop it. Mother... Mother. Mother. Mother. Why? Mother, Mother. Domeng. Tell me a story. You've changed. I needed to. You make him happy. Isn't that for the best? I've never heard him laugh before. When he's happy, he won't hurt you. You don't know him. I want to get to know him. Who is he? I don't know. He took me in... ...after ruining my parents' lives. He's cruel. Why are you still here? I tried to escape. I had nowhere to go. People are cold-hearted to slaves like me... They see our lives as something to toy with. I used to think... ...that the kindness of others could fill the emptiness of a cruel life... But I was wrong. We're already poor, but we're treated worse than dirt. Not once did I get to see the light... ...and I have stopped hoping. But I wanted to live, so I came back. I begged father to take me back. What happened here? I don't know. That's enough. I don't want to miss a feeling I might never experience again. Have you ever touched a woman's body? Father might wake up. He's drunk. He'll be asleep till past sunrise. This is my breast. Can you feel it? This is my nipple. If you play with it with your fingers, it will feel even better. You know, Domeng... ...it is a whole other level of pleasure, if you play with it with your tongue. Do you want a taste? It's in front of your mouth... ...stick your tongue out. Bathe it with your saliva. How does it feel? My whole body is trembling. Can you feel the hole? Is this the first time you've brushed your hand against... ...a warm and wet pussy? Put your finger in... It's so hard... It's swollen and throbbing... Does my touch feel good? Don't be shy. Next time, I'll let you cum inside me. Your cum tastes sweet. Would you like me to bring up your food? I'll eat later. You should rest for now. I'm going to do the laundry, okay? When I come back, I'll make you feel better. Aren't you Cora? Are you alone? Get up! No, please stop. Please, have mercy. Please stop. Cora, my daughter. My child, let's go. Come now, dear, let's go home. Don't bring me back to the devil's house. Please, I beg you. Let's go. Let's go Cora. Be careful. Come on. Mother's here. Please stop. Where did you hide the jewelry? I didn't! I didn't take anything. Where? Please stop, father. Please have mercy. I'm not going to stop until you bring out what you stole. Please stop. Just kill him. Where did you hide the jewelry? How can you be both blind and a thief? I'm not a thief. Look? You're a liar. My rheumatism is flaring up again. You shouldn't wear yourself out by punishing Domeng like that. It's a waste of your energy. You need your milk. Catch it with your mouth. Don't waste the milk. How does it feel? I want more. How good is it? It's good, It's so good. Louder. It's so good. Louder. You feel so good. I'm going to stop now. No, don't stop. I want you to beg. Don't, please. What? I beg you. Please. I'm begging you, don't stop. - What? - Let me cum inside you. Let me cum inside you. Damn idiot! Thank you. What were you doing there? A while ago... I thought of killing myself. But I chickened out. My life is cursed. I feel like I'm paying for the sins of all my ancestors. I've only ever felt happiness once. When? The night that I felt your body. I wishâ€¦ I never experienced any of that. It only made my loneliness more unbearable. I hope... ...after tonight... ...I'll draw my last breath. At least I'll leave with some joy in my heart. Take me away from here. I'll be your slave. You're the only person he's been with that he's not beating up. He may be kind to you now, but it'll only last... ...until he finds someone else. What could the Japanese want with the provinces? Especially with a poor village like this? It's scary that we're burning the body. Why would we waste energy burying them? It's better for the flames to burn away... ...every trace of them in this world. Domeng. I'm glad you're not wearing any underwear. There's a small gathering at Bino's. Are you coming with me? Do I need to? I wanted to get some rest. Go, rest. I'm not staying there for long. When I come back... ...I want you to serve me. Here's something for what you and your daughter went through. Bino. It looks like Miling finally convinced you to leave, huh? Where are you headed? Wherever our feet will take us. For as long as we can. If we can, until San Rafael. Far from everything else. From what I heard... ...there are only around ten families living there. What of your coconut wine? Who will buy it? Seeing as Miling successfully persuaded me... ...I concede to her plans. We'll set aside our business for now... ...and put our safety first. Some people have seen with their own eyes, the truth about the cruelty... ...of the Japanese soldiers. It doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman. I, for one, am not leaving this place. I'm sure I can get along with everyone. The important thing is... ...you give what the conquerors want. Then they won't bother you. You might need to take a dip in the stream later... ...to refresh yourself and restore your sobriety. Bino. There is no wine that can put me out. I knew it. He might not be able to go home. Don't worry, I'll take him home. You're a fool, Tiago. You're right. I am a fool. Did you have fun ravishing Selina's body? Did she smell sweet? Was she smooth? Did you lick every crevice and entrance she had on her body? Yes. Your daughter is all mine. She is not my daughter. My wife didn't owe you anything. You courted her. Then threatened her. You raped her. You ruined our lives. I'm infertile. Selina is your child. You're right. Selina is all yours. Now we're even. You motherfucker. You motherfucker! It's so good. Deeper. Get away from my child. You traitor. - He's not your child. - You monster. He is your slave. You will never lay a hand on me again. You monster. - Come on, come here. - You're a traitor, Domeng. Come on, get over here. Tiago! You're a traitor, Domeng. Selina! Come on, come here. Does my blade feel good deep in your gut? Selina. Come on, come here. Selina. Come on, come here. Come here. Domeng. That's enough. He's gone. What's this? We'll split Tiago's gold and money. Use that for your new life. That is your power. I don't need this... ...because I'm with you. Forgive me, Domeng. We can't be together. Listen to me. Be brave. Don't let them abuse you, or hurt you. You must love yourself. Don't leave me. Don't leave me. Selina. Selina. Selina. Selina. Selina. Selina. Selina.
