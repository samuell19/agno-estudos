Osenev Chapter 2: in Which Pooh Goes Visiting and Gets Into a Tight Place One morning, breakfast was far behind, and dinner was still in distant future Winnie-the-Pooh was having a walk with Piglet and composing a new song Not quite... No, that's not right - Why don't we go visiting? - Visiting? Yes, I thought: why don't we go visiting To have a little snack Who goes visiting in the morning? Who visits in the morning... Wait... Going visiting in the morning... Rum-tum-tiddle-um-tum! Going visiting in the morning is smart Everybody knows that's what mornings are for That's what mornings are for - Where are we going? - Your place, of course Evenings are dull, everyone is yawning This never happens with morning visitors Never with morning visitors - You do have something to eat? - I have the other balloon! No, let's not go to your place Otherwise I am going visiting but you're not Okay. Then let's go to your place A morning guest is in no hurry Hosts shout Hurray from joy Hosts shout from joy Wait... now it is I who is not going visiting What shall we do? Pooh, I have an idea let's go visit... somebody The Sun comes visiting us in the morning Pam-param! Always visit in the morning! Well, if I know anything about anything - this hole is a burrow. - Okay and a burrow means Rabbit and Rabbit means Company and Company means food and snacks! Hey, is anybody at home? I said, is anybody at home? No! You needn't shout so loud I heard you quite well the first time Sorry, isn't there anybody at all? Nobody whatsoever This can't be There must be somebody there because somebody must have said Nobody Hallo, Rabbit, isn't that you? No, it's not me Well, could you very kindly tell me where Rabbit is? He has gone to see his friend Pooh Bear But this is Me! What sort of "Me"? There are all kinds of Me Me is Winnie-the-Pooh Are you sure? Of course! Yes indeed, Winnie-the-Pooh And who's this? This is Piglet Indeed... Piglet. Well, then, come in By the way, this says "Wipe your feet" Wi-pe... yo-ur... Aha, got it Going visiting is tricky business When inside make it look like we don't want anything Hi Rabbit, by chance, we were passing by - Perhaps you'll come in since you were by chance, passing by? - Oh, yes So, I was saying as we were passing by, why don't we drop by... ...Rabbit's place? Pooh was getting anxious, but smart Rabbit figured it was time for a snack Washstand is over there Honey or condensed milk with your bread? You want honey or both? Both! But don't bother about the bread - Well, time to go. - We shouldn't leave right away, it's not polite Must you leave already? Yes, we must go, good by, thanks a lot Thanks a lot Well, if you won't have any more... Is there any more? You're not in a hurry? No, I'm absolutely free until Friday Well, then we can stay a little while And they stayed a while longer then a little longer and just a bit longer and a tad longer until, alas, there was nothing left And that's when Pooh recalled some important business: - Yes, time to go We could stay a bit longer No! As a matter of fact, I was going out myself directly Oh well, then, we'll be going on - Good-bye! - Good day. - Thank you! Not at all Take care Bye - Good-bye - Good-bye - Thanks a lot The pleasure was mine! Well, we shall go then Oh, I'd better go back Or better go forward... no, back... Help! Help and bother! - Help! - Winnie, what's wrong? - Help! - What are you, stuck? N-no, just resting Here, give us a paw - Piglet, pull! - Okay Ow, you're hurting! The fact is, he is stuck It all comes of not having front doors big enough No, it all comes of eating too much What shall we do? Nothing. We shall have to wait for him to get thin again - Do we have to wait long? - A week! - How long? - A week, no less! Oh, I think I just got slenderer Quick, pull me out of here! After this visit Pooh figured he shouldn't be staying that long so as not to find himself in a Tight Place Nobody knew what Rabbit though because he was very polite Winnie-the-Pooh is full of joy that is why he sings aloud And as long as he gains no weight which he won't gain, no way, yea! The End
