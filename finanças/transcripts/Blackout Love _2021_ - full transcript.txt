Hi. Hi. Making love to you was so nice. I'll go make coffee. You know that chicken breast you forget in the fridge? That's still pink and plump even if it's expired? You think: "It's still pink and plump, I can eat it"... So you eat it and realize it was expired. You see, men, like chicken, should be consumed right away. Or thrown away ASAP. Morning. Blocked. If only we could advertise them like abandoned puppies. Urgent! This is poor Giulio. Affectionate and sweet, endowed and playful. Unaware of his future and outgoing. He's always hungry for affection. He doesn't realize his master isn't coming back. Unfortunately, love is binary. Some win, some lose, some dump, some get dumped. The point is to stay focused, never go soft. Never think that things can go differently. Stretching! Betta, I liked that attack. Cami, keep an eye on the setter. Our girl Alessia needs to tell us what's going on because I have no idea. Will you play like this at the semifinals? We have one mission and that is to win the...? - Championship. - Then stand up! Let me hear you! - One, two, three... - Smash the enemy. - Louder! - Smash the enemy. - I can't hear you! - Smash the enemy! And above all, never allow a naive suffering soul to make the same mistakes you did. It's a matter of female complicity. It won't open. I see. He dumped you? He said he doesn't know what he wants anymore. He won't take your calls? - Since when? - Three hours ago. Is he online? Asshole. Here's what you'll do: don't contact him again. He'll come back, they always do. When he comes crawling back to you humiliated, then you block him forever. It's called re-education. Now let's try to open this. Bye, Alessia. Bye, girls. He's rocking! Hi, honey. Vodka tonic, please. Less tonic. And you still have sex with him? Unfortunately, I love him. It might seem that by following these strict rules for survival you won't end up living idyllically. But hey, perfection doesn't exist. And who hasn't gone through rough patches in life? The point is to know you are always in control. Because only when you have the upper hand do things go exactly how you want them to. Some may say that traumas need to be worked out and not erased. At times I even have doubts that something is not quite right. That not everything is under control. Hi, baby. Why the fuck are you here? I suspected you'd kill me one day. You seem... different. You're prettier. Fuck! Oh God! - But how? - Dunno! You tell me. Why is he in my house? He's dead. But I didn't do it, I think. What does that mean? You might've done it? I always said I wanted him to drop dead. My mind is playing tricks. - Did you call an ambulance? - I don't remember anything. Why is he in my house? I don't want to end up in jail for Shitbag. He's alive. - What'll I do? - Call an ambulance! BLACKOUT LOVE - Your relationship with the victim? - None. At all. Why did you call him "victim"? Whose victim? - Recognize these? - Yes. My extra keys, I keep them on my landing. - And Marco knew. - Yes, we lived together. By chance, did your relationship end in a traumatic way? For who? Him? Not really. He dumped me on our anniversary with a post-it during our vacation. Last night, your ex-boyfriend had a car accident. His car was found near your house and the rest is clear: he used the keys to go into your house. I was with my friends all night, they can confirm that. And I don't know why Marco was in my house. You have his mom's number and the facts, now can I leave or do I need a lawyer? Hello, I'm his mother! Hello, have a seat. - What happened to my son? - Hi, Rosemary, I'm leaving. - Good thing you were there. - It was by chance. Marco suffered a head injury that I would define as rather serious. Near the temporal lobe zone. - How is he now? - Why was he in my house? He's stable and conscious. And he's convinced that's his house. The house where he lives with his girlfriend: you. No, you have no idea what you're saying. What you're saying is not convincing at all, considering that her son refused to speak to me for a year. We are here. Marco is somewhere else with his memory. Post-traumatic amnesia. Serious. - And? - It's a temporary phenomenon. Most of the times. His brain needs time to catch up. If he were to realize right now that he can't recall a year of his life, he'd risk having a psychotic break. So this is what we'll do. We'll keep him under observation for 48-72 hours. At that point, your cooperation would be instrumental. From woman to woman, you don't have to be intimate. - What? - Yes. Just for ten days, you saw the shape he's in. Bad. His situation is serious. Like the doctor said, you heard. - So you need to be... - Be a real bitch to say no. But you're forgetting one small detail. It's your son's fault I became a bitch. And your fault for how you raised him. Yes, you're right. - Did I spoil him too much? - Good luck. Please think it over. SHITBAG! DON'T OPEN I TOLD YOU NOT TO OPEN IT LOVE POEMS "To my favorite poet, happy anniversary" "Tricky, I'm sorry our journey ends here, but it does" TO NEVER FORGET I just wanted to talk to him but he blocked me! I can't believe this, how gross. - Come here. - I want to die. - No, let's get in bed. - I want him to die. I want to be a shrimp. - Careful. - An asexual shrimp. - A squid. - Okay. - A seahorse. - Wait! Careful! Let's kill him. - Give me your hand. - I hate you! I hate you, Shitbag! It doesn't seem normal to ask you something like that. Right. And it doesn't seem normal that a doctor suggested it. In fact. Psychologically speaking, it's incredibly unfair. I think so too. Imagine when this poor sucker wakes up and realizes it was a farce. Are we talking about my situation or about his? Let's talk about your situation. Let's talk about you. It seems clear by your reactions, that you never remotely got over this breakup. How dare they have the nerve to come and ask you to stage a relationship with him? I think I'm beyond over it. Can we say you seem more upset than you should be? What if you found your shitbag ex bleeding on your floor after a year of no contact? I know, I agree with you. It's a hard thing for someone to easily get over. Stop saying I'm not over it! Sorry... it took me an hour to get them to sleep. So if you could lower your voices, thanks. Might I point out that I've had lots of casual relationships. I dumped the last one... when was it? Yesterday, I think. - The late Giulio? - He wanted to love me, what a drag. This is symptomatic too. Of what? I'm going strong and am perfectly balanced, so I said bye-bye to him. But... with this guy, did you at least... take your leave courteously? You took off again? I think the situation is a bit more complicated than you make it out to be, but you don't have to listen. - The end. - Yes. The end. Three, two, one... You need to face reality. The more you refuse to face reality, the more difficult it is to overcome trauma. You get stuck. The end. It'd be great to be able to rewrite the past. But you can't. And I hate seeing you like this. - Like what? - You're pissing your life away! - I'm going to sleep now. - She didn't mean that. Tell her you didn't mean that! Hi. I brought over the bare necessities. There's more by the elevator. See you soon. I WOULDN'T EVEN GIVE IT TO MY DOG Fuck! Oil of youth? Pathetic, I'll take this. Happy anniversary I look like a triceratops, delete it Now I'll call you "Tricky" Funny... TRICKY! I'll call this "Ready in 5 minutes" From Silvia What happened? Have a good trip, baby, here's a picture of us painting like fiends Tricky, I waited till late, but have to stay in Tokyo. I've had two long flights, I need to rest. But since it's almost midnight there, happy birthday, my love. We'll celebrate when I'm back. Baby, it's not midnight, it's 4:00. But I figured you weren't coming back. Goodnight and thanks. - Relax. - I am relaxed, very relaxed. But I'm not happy about this burden. You know, out all of the girls, there were many, that came after you... Some were real characters... You're still the best. Why? Tell me why? That sounded insensitive but it was a compliment. I clashed with them all. I'm not surprised. So, the doctor said he has to stay at home without Internet, or his phone. Isolated. This is his phone, he doesn't know they found it. Hide it. - Honey! - Mom, lower your voice. How are you? My head's aching, I want to get out of here. We'll go home now. Help me? Yes. You look good with more meat on your bones. - But I lost weight. - You really look good. I lost 2 kilos. I was on the Keto diet. I'll go get the car, see you outside. - It was a compliment. - Sure. Poor word choice. Here we are. I wasn't expecting this from you. What? You tidied up. I really am worried now. Did you bang your head too? - Someone's back to normal. - Boing! - Boing! - Shit. To address the topic of babies, one day Marco came home with Boing. But then he dumped us both and we became depressed. Boing started taking rabbit Xanax. But when I forgot to give him his pill... Give me your paw. Don't, it's dangerous. He's doing well, he's at Silvia's for a few days. She must be giving him an Oedipus complex. The doctor suggested it for hygienic reasons. But tons of articles say pet therapy is important for recovery. Is there anything I can do for you? Yes. I want to take off these clothes and shower. Go ahead. Cooperate. One leg in. The other. - Okay, bye. - Wait! - I can't shower with boxers! - Jesus! Fine. God! - What's wrong? - Nothing. Oh God, bye. Wait, my head's spinning. What if I fall? What an insane situation! Damn it! - What insane situation? - Never mind. You always complain that I'm not around enough, now I'll be home for days. Maybe I don't want you home for days. I had an accident and you're acting like the victim. You're incredible! - What's wrong? - Nothing. You're unbearable. It's absurd. It's all so absurd! You are absurdly handsome. So perfectly proportioned you seem photoshopped. - What are you doing? - Looking at you. You lost a few kilos, huh? Typical of someone who is doing well and bounced back. And that irritates me! I don't know what crazy mood you're in, but if anyone should be pissed off it's me, not you. I haven't said a single word about everything that happened. Actually, I'm trying hard to put the whole matter behind me. What matter are you talking about? Play dumb, sure, we'll have to tackle it eventually. But be thankful I'm glossing over, and try to be less bitchy. - Where's my fucking scrub? - Not in there? - I'll go get it. - Thanks. You're welcome. - Easy! - I'm not a nurse, you know. - Can I have my phone? - Yes. I'm so sorry, it got busted in the accident. The doc said no computer, internet, noise, or TV. Fine, you don't have to keep repeating it. - Can I have my record player? - Yes. But don't keep pestering me for things. Okay. It's me and you. Isolated from the world. - No... - What? - Why? - Because you can't feel your legs. Hate to be optimistic, but something did just move. You look pale. Dehydrated, debilitated. The doc said not to exert yourself. - I can just lie back. - Nope. Not even a little treat? - What's the big deal? - I'll go make dinner. What'll we do all night? Seven, eight, nine, ten. One more. Hello? Hi. - Why are you whispering? - I'm tired. Can we talk later? I just wanted to apologize for the other day, I was a bit too aggressive. - How are you? - Fine, we'll talk later. If you want, we can meet up without talking. We can just sit together in silence. - I can manage that. - I don't think so, but thanks. - I'll call you. - Okay, but... You're listening to Kiss? Oh, you mean the radio? Yeah, it's on the radio. - Awful, I hate it. Anyway... - Vale, where are you? Who's that? Hold on. He's here. - You're saying he's there? - Yes. That's what I just said. For fuck's sake, we talked about this! Please don't start rambling about how wrong this is. I'm saying it for your own good. You'll push me to do the opposite. What will you do? You're wrong to say I can't rewrite history. I can! I sure can! You're having delusions of omnipotence. I just have to grin and bear it. And I will win him back. We'll go to his mom's country house and I'll dump him this time. And I'll make him suffer like the shitbag he is. You want to get revenge? Yes, have we met!? - Can I have some coffee? - Hold on! I've been waiting 5 minutes. He's an indescribable pain in the ass, I'd forgotten. Cranky and difficult. You couldn't just leave him to have a psychotic break like the doctor said without doing all this? No, then the suffering wouldn't be associated with me. I want the thought of me to make him suffer. That's the subtle but major difference. I'm speechless. Hanging up in three seconds. - Wait! - One... - If you come crawling... - Two... Saying you want to be an asexual squid... - I will... - Three, done. - What's with this fucking record? - Must be scratched. What are you doing? What's with this record? You're standing up. You're faking it? No? I get carried away when I see you. I've been rolling you around in a wheelchair for two days. You were near death, now you're Lazarus? How dare you? I had a serious accident. It's automatic with you, those are our roles. - I can't believe this. - Where are you going? To practice, I'm already late. See you later. You're leaving me here alone? Boing's not even here. Boing's dead by the way. You left the window open, it's your fault he jumped out. Soft knees! Follow the play, come on. - Jump! - Got it! Good job. Go, Crissi. Up, Betta. That's more like! Jump hard. Hard! Higher, Cami. Cover it! Great defense. Yes, Crissi. Go, Alessia. What the heck? You can't keep playing this way. We won't win the finals. Girls, we must smash the enemy or they'll smash us. It's basic. Hold my jacket. And my whistle. Where's the ball? Pass it. Spike. Shit. Sorry, I'm a bit stressed out. Camilla, sorry. - That's why you cut your hair? - How romantic. Not at all. She's gone back in time to save his life. He has no clue what she's doing for him. To save him. No, I'm doing it to get revenge. Despite the stress, she's traveling back in time with him. Wish that would happen to me! Before he wakes up and it all vanishes. And goes back to normal. Get up! Do push-ups. Two sets of 20, now! Practice isn't over. Hi. What's wrong? Nothing. You're not going to ask how I am? - How are you? - You left me alone all day. With a massive headache I did everything alone. Do you not give a shit at all? Truth? I didn't feel like coming home so I wandered around. You sure are a bitch. You're been glacial since I got out of the hospital. It's like you don't care about us. I haven't even addressed the real issues. You have no idea what the real issues are. Then tell me, since you're playing dumb, but I happened to notice you're still taking the pill. - I don't take the pill. - You're denying it? You're incredible. And you haven't said a word. Not even "I'm sorry". Nothing. Instead you treat me like a stranger. You're talking about when you found my birth control? - Are you fucking with me? - Sorry, I forgot. You're psycho. No, things are just complicated. I find the pills, we argue, I go out, I have an accident, and you don't remember? Really! The accident wasn't my fault. Your mind was elsewhere. - Don't try laying this on me too. - Fine, deny it. Just answer one question then. Want a baby with me or not? - Now's not the time for that question. - Answer, please. You think I'd be a bad dad? I can't take it. - I can't take it. - Why didn't you say no? I remember clearly telling you I took the pill. You didn't tell me anything, you said: "Let's give it a try". But you kept taking the pill in secret. You're the one who ruined my life! - You ruined everything. - Is that so? When? - This conversation makes no sense. - Listen... - I already know how it'll end. - Right, you know everything. How'll it end, tell me. You'll dump me. I'm asking you to have a baby with me while you keep taking the pill in secret. I'm not the man to have a baby with, say it. Did you stop and think that I don't want to have a baby for a good reason? And you're not the center of my universe. Fuck you and your wounded masculinity. Fuck you! - I told him I was taking it. - Be quiet! Sorry. You didn't tell him. You had the same exact argument a year ago when he found out. - Whose side are you on? - Yours. If you're fighting over the same things you fought over a year ago, and he's actually right, you're going to push him to dump you again. This could be the right time to talk to each other. Which is crucial for getting over... Yes, I get it. I hate when she's right. You're telling me. At least we know where he stands with his memory. Meaning? Just before the post-it. - He's about to dump me. - That's what I said. - No, fuck! - Auntie, don't say "fuck". - Mom gets mad. - Sorry. I don't want to end up like you guys. Meaning? I'll go home and say everything I never told the shitbag for a year. - Then I'll dump him. - Don't say "shit" either. Come on, it's the fourth time, I counted. - Be quiet! - Thanks. You're a fucking genius! You're not. Love you. Marco, where are you? Come in here, we need to talk. I'm about to say something that's not easy for me. Okay. You're right. Specifically in regards to the pill, you are right. And I'm sorry. I don't think I have what it takes. When you cornered me I was afraid to tell you, then we argued and it all went to hell. Are you drunk? I drank a little but I'm not drunk. I don't know how to process this utterly historic event. It doesn't happen often. You saying: "You're right, I'm sorry". Event. Being high-minded as I am, I'd decided to cook for us both. Let's open a nice bottle to celebrate this event? Incredible. Are you listening? I'm saying something important and you're not listening. We said I was right and you're sorry. Let me bask in this moment. No, you can't bask in it, come here and listen to me. For a year I've had important things to say, but you cut me off, so listen now! - A year? - Hush! The point is not me taking the pill or not, the point is not us having this damn baby or not, the point is if I'm telling you something important... if I'm telling you I'm afraid I'd be a train wreck and I don't think I have what it takes to be a mom, you should listen to me. You're not here, you don't help. I always feel so alone. You focus on the mistakes made, the arguments, the wounded pride, and do this... You leave me and don't even know why. I'm sorry. - You never told me before. - I've been trying to tell you. Not that explicitly. I won't leave you. You're amazing. You're amazing, you're not a train wreck. That's your perception. - Really? - Yes. I don't think I have what it takes. Then I look at you and think... But Vale is here. Oh great. I've seen the future. We won't have these darn kids. I don't care, as long as we have each other. I love you. You're my life. What did I do? I missed you. - I missed you. - Me too. You gave me a scare! I woke up and you were gone. Boeing 737, twinjet. Beautiful beast. What if I don't recover from this accident? They won't let me fly anymore. I was always afraid of you flying. I always wanted you to change jobs. You never told me. What job would you have liked me to do? Dentist. You'd look hot in a white lab coat. True. I'm sorry I'm always so grumpy and snippety. But... I feel like I'm in a strange bubble. I feel like we're losing each other. But it felt like we bonded before. We haven't talked like that in ages. Thanks to you. It's me and you. Things should be easier. Right? What's wrong? What matters is you remember this was all real. Why do you talk about us in the past tense? - It's cold, Marco, let's go home. - Okay. Can we see some friends? I'm tired of this quarantine. Goodnight. Will you hug me? It was great making love to you, Tricky. Ditto. If there are not two blue ticks it means he didn't read it? But it says he's "online". Maybe he's chatting with someone else. He's chatting with other women. Maybe, maybe not. Bye. Wait, let's have some coffee. Like when I used to visit you two. I don't know what you're thinking, but this is all fake. Maybe, but when I came over this morning, it didn't seem fake to me at all. I haven't seen him like that in ages. Can I get some coffee too? - He's all yours. - Coming. - Who's there? - I'll get it. I think it's a meter reader, but I'm not opening the door. Want me to get it? I can hear you. - It's not a good time. - Let me in. - No, not now. - How rude. Let's have a conversation like two adults, okay? - Please, help me. - Who's he? Tell me what I did wrong. You disappeared. Whatever it was, it's over now, so get lost. Who's he? I'm wondering the same. Honey, this is Giulio. A friend from the gym. Hi. Never seen you before. How do you two know each other? I just told you, from the gym. - I... - Is it a secret? Things are a bit complicated. This boy and I are seeing each other. Baby, I told you not to follow me, I'm busy today. My son had a horrible accident. Don't you believe me? - No, listen... - No, please. Let's talk in private, baby. My son is very weak. Stop, what is going on? Are you here because you like my mother or my girlfriend? Mom... - How old are you? - 29. Mom! You're dating someone from Valeria's gym? And you introduced him to my mom? I promise you I knew nothing about this relationship. Christ! Why? Only you're allowed to date younger women? - Excuse me? - Nonsense! Nonsense? Smirking under your mustache. Don't falsely describe me. It's late. - Let's get going. - I'll go too. Bye, doll, I'm so sorry. My son is rude. - I'll call you. - Sure. - You think I'm stupid? - Giulio, believe me. He's at risk of having a shock that would shatter him. Irreparable trauma if he discovers the truth. Is this why you vanished and blocked me? - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? Don't I deserve an explanation? Or am I disposable? What if someone did that to you? I'm becoming an awful person. Valeria, tell me why. The exact moment was when you said: "Making love to you was so nice". But if you want a more generalized reason, I think our relationship was... You're 39, right? I wear it very well. You're 40 and can't look me in the face and be real? I told you already, I'm sorry. Apart from Marco's situation, our relationship has no future. What? Do you think I came here to say I want to date you? No. Right. I came to tell you you're a horrible person. Nobody's ever blocked me before. And for what? Nothing. I think you have major mental issues, but despite this, I don't feel bad for you. And you know what? You can go fuck yourself. Come on, girls! Come on, girls! Smash it! One, two, three, smash the enemy! We're off to the finals! Keep it aggressive! Good job! I understand my mom wants some pleasure at her age. But he was just a kid! - Please... - A child. Even if you or Vale dated him it would be ridiculous! So the problem is a woman can't date a younger man? - I'm not saying that. - You said that. I'm saying that Giulio seemed so wide-eyed. He could barely talk. You're a psychologist, you know when someone gets together with a child? That's what he is. Isn't it... out of insecurity? Because it makes you feel like you have control but in reality, you're a loser. - I see. - Honey? - The pasta. - Oh right, sorry. Listen, he may have had brain trauma but he just made a rather accurate analysis. Very accurate. He's here talking to us thinking it was a year ago. - Isn't it odd? - Odd? I'm hallucinating. - You slept with him. - No. Yes. - You told me to make up. - Not this way. This is how I make up. One heck of a night! Pasta time! Hope it's good. Guests first. Thanks. - How's work? - Fine. - We're going to the finals. - Really? - Wow! - Awesome. Thanks to me, but they're very motivated. - I'm glad. - Yes. What is it? What's wrong? Nothing... it was just... I've been having strange déjà vu. This is wild. Incredible. Tell us, what were you thinking about just now? Don't ask that! He had an accident and head trauma. For science! I'm remembering... who was that guy who was always at team practice? Who? - Whatshisname! - Who? Sorry, my memory isn't at its best. The guy who came to practice and became smitten with one of the girl's mothers. And went to bed with her. That guy who loves Laura Pausini. You say his wife is a ballbreaker. - Ballbreaker? - Yes. Married, and his wife was pregnant with baby number two. - Really? - Marco, enough. - What? - Enough. So Valeria didn't really need referee reporting? No, what are you saying? Valeria did need it. It was actually score marking. - Can we discuss this at home? - Sure. We have to discuss this and we will at home. It wasn't them, they have one kid. - Marco, be quiet. - Yes, be quiet. Do what Valeria did. With your guilty conscience it's no surprise you hid this. I lost my appetite. Fabrizio, let's go. - Okay. - Silvia! Thanks, Marco, it looks tasty. You're a real bitch. - And a liar. - Wait. Let me explain. - Will you say something? - My memory is hazy! The number you are calling... Not answering? You should've told me! Who knew that you'd start talking about an affair? I don't know what got into me. I have these flashbacks and remember some details. Only after did I realize he was the cheater. Did we have a painting there? Let's take a break and go to your mom's country house. Okay. All right. Goodnight. - Come on! - Damn, I'll get you. Watch it. What did you see? Nothing. Are you sure this is the way? Of course it is. Don't you recognize the potholes? It's all dusty. - Nobody came here anymore? - Dunno. When did we last come here? Is that a joint? - Where'd you find it? - Downstairs in a drawer. We should quit, it's so infantile. Lemme take a hit. - Isn't it infantile? - Yes. - Let's go to the hot springs. - No. - We always go. - So what? It's so close by, come on. Try and relax. I hate hot springs, you can't see the bottom. - What is there to see? - Damn joints. Come on! I bet there are wild boars here. Quit laughing. - Get undressed. - It's cold. - I'm not going in. - If I go, you go. - Are you serious? - I'm going. One, two, three. I'm the only person in the world who gets depressed by planes in the sky. You're so dramatic. - Tell me why. - One, I'm afraid of flying. Two, because planes take you away from me. But last time you were afraid to fly you met me. Some consolation! - You were having a panic attack. - What? Miss? If we land safely, I'll buy you a drink. The cheapest ticket in the history of cheap tickets. But you went out with me. Wait. Nobody's here. That's not why. I need to talk to you. Go ahead. Cat's got your tongue? I haven't seen you smile like that in ages. What's wrong? Tell me what you wanted to say. I don't know. Let's not ruin this. Tomorrow's our anniversary too. Did you forget that tomorrow's our anniversary? We're not here for our anniversary. - Let's go. - Stay away! Wait. - What's going on? - Calm down. - Why are we here? - Calm down. It was a given you'd remember eventually. What are you saying? The doctor asked me to. A favor for the fucking doctor. And your mom begged me. - My mom is nuts. - Let me talk, wait. - You're a monster. - Wait, let me explain. You pretended to be with me for a week? You're a monster. No worse, you're mentally ill. You're sick in the head, you know. I am sick, I've been sick for a year. You're right, only a crazy person would do what I did. Or someone desperate. The person I was with for 5 years suddenly dumped me with an orange post-it note. Oh please, I didn't dump you with an orange post-it! I woke up and you were gone. I saw that damn post-it and you were gone. You didn't even allow me to say one word. We fought all night and then broke up. I preferred to remember you sleeping sweetly than screaming at me. - You dumped and betrayed me. - Me? - Yes. - Right... And I trusted you. Relationships are complex and you don't just dump someone you love. You don't know what it means to love someone. How dare you! Of course I know! I knew it a year ago and I knew it this whole shitty year and I know it now. I would never have left the person I love, the person you kept asking to have a baby with. You don't do things like this! After what I found on your phone... You don't just dump me. We talk about it, discuss it. I made a stupid mistake because I was always alone. Instead of talking to me, you and your pride decided to leave. You had a lover! No, I didn't. He and I just chatted because you were never around, you never listened, you were obsessed with a baby. You put us on hold, we were in a rut, while you fucked him. I didn't fuck anyone. I know you... You staged all this to get revenge. You wanted to dump me. Of course I wanted to dump you and block you. To make you suffer like I suffered all year. But then I thought things could be different, what a fool. If you think I like what I did then you don't understand a thing. But I had no other choice. I don't want to see you ever again. Wait! I need to understand! - Are you dumping me? - What? You're dumping me again? I was supposed to do that! I'm not dumping you because we split up a year ago! But if I could, I would dump you again. Actually, you know what, pretend I did. Fucking bastard! Fucking bastard! Get off me! - You're nuts! - You ruined me! - Get your hands off me! - You ruined my life! Hello. - What happened? - What? You banged your head. You're under observation. You've had a little concussion. Where's Marco? He drove you here, made sure you were okay, and left. - Did he say anything else? - No. Sorry. You can't get up, stay calm. We'll do some more tests and then you can go, you seem confused. I seem confused? Confused? You're an incompetent psycho and I'm a fool for listening to you. And now yet again, I have to pick up the pieces of my life alone, again, and you say I'm confused. I'm not confused, doc, I'm fucking pissed off. I can assure you that if you hadn't played along, Marco would've suffered disastrous consequences from the shock. I wish that had happened. - Calm down. - I don't want to calm down. I have no desire to calm down. This is why I hate working Sunday shifts, damn it. Sunday? Goodbye. - We won? - Yes. Girls, I apologize, what a nightmare... I fought with Marco, I didn't dump him, but he dumped me again. - Imagine that! - Coach, sorry... but we don't really care about that right now. Did you follow my suggestions? - We did what we wanted. - Right. See you Tuesday. Bye, good job. You're mad at me too? Edoardo dumped me. To be honest, I don't think "re-education" actually works. All it seems to do is make people angry, and weak, and shitty. I have to go study Greek. So your mom lied to me. And you didn't answer my texts because you were isolated. - You slept with her? - That's not the point. You were convinced you were together and loved her. So you loved her for a week. Yes. Because I had amnesia. So you've just come out of an idyllic relationship with her, as if the present and past have merged. What I mean is, you... - How are you? - I don't know, Vale! Stella, sorry. I don't know about the present... merging with the past and all that stuff. I feel... I feel pissed off that she fooled me. Sorry. Are you sure? Yes, sure. - You slept with her? - That's not the point. Don't you start nitpicking too! Who is it? Meter reader. - Orosco, let me in. - No, you can't! - Rosemary! - Please, no! How rude! - It's urgent. - Don't go in! Why haven't you answered my calls? Are you mad at me too? God, you're so impulsive. I was too busy to answer. Did you talk to Marco? He won't pick up, I need to talk to him. No, I think he dumped us both. Who's that? Marco? Are you hiding in the closet like a child? Don't, please. Answer me, I beg you. I'm sorry about everything. There's a 40-something man in your closet. I told you I was busy. - The guy from Whatsapp? - Bingo! He's handsome. If you talk to Marco, tell him I'm sorry about what happened. Sure, but it's unlikely. Never mind then. Bye. Don't you want to hug me at least? You were my daughter-in-law again. You're the only one who puts up with me. Because I like you. And I like you. Thanks. Bye, sorry. You know when you leave your keys in the key bowl and you're sure you left them there? You're 100% sure. You'd bet your life on it. And then, after accusing someone of having moved them, you find them in your bag. That feeling of disbelief. And after disbelief, major doubt. Maybe I can be wrong at times too. Hey, zombie. Thanks. - What are you doing? - Exhilarating stuff. Watching cartoons. - Cool. - Very. Can I watch cartoons with you? Come in. - Say hi to auntie. - Hi, Aurora and Alice. Since I'm so magnanimous, we'll leave daddy to watch cartoons. How are things? We've seen better days. I'm waiting. I've made so many mistakes. And I apologize. Sorry for not telling you about Fabrizio. Or I should've forced him to fess up. But I wasn't on his side, I always told him he was an asshole. Understand? - Understand? - Yes. Yes, I understood. Can I be part of the conversation too? Go on. You were right about Marco, you were right about everything. Actually, I barely said anything about Marco. Tell me what you think, please. I don't think you did it for revenge. You are childish, so maybe you partly did it for that, but you really did it because even though you thought you could play around with Giulio, with Camillo, etc... you were really dying to have just a shred of what you and Marco were. And what's more... - Mom, can I have water? - Yes, sweetie. Here. All of that anger you have is because deep down you know you ruined things too. And honestly, whenever you talk about Shitbag, I can't help but think that you're a bit of a shitbag too. Don't say "shit" in front of the kids. Mom even said you're an asshole a few times. - Really? - I said that about dad too. - Yes. - Even daddy. - But I apologized. - Go in the other room. - Go with daddy, sweetie. - Come on. Then why are you always on my side? What a silly question! The point is not who is wrong or right, who dumps first, who dumps last, grow up! I'm your friend, I'll always be here even if you're a shitbag. - I'm a train wreck. - No, you're not. - I'm in deep shit. - Acknowledgement is good. It's the first step for getting back on track. I think I'm pregnant. Actually, I am pregnant. - You're in deep shit! - Shut up and hug me. Okay. Poor thing. You can come stay with us. - We'll be an extended family. - Okay. - Do you love me at all? - Of course we do. Of course we love you. Quit making that face. If you didn't leave the keys on the landing, I'd buzz. What do you want? What do I want? My mother called me. 20 times. Since I never answered she came over to argue with that girl I was with before you caused this mess. A pathetic scene that ended with Stella leaving. But do you know what pisses me off the most? Not only did you do it for revenge, not only did you interfere in my life, which wasn't that great but it didn't suck, but what pisses me off the most is you instilled doubt in me too. Fuck you. While Stella walked out with my mom screaming, do you know what I felt? I felt relieved. And this is what pisses me off most. Clearly, I am crazy, right? Or maybe my memory hasn't entirely returned. I hate you. I swear, I can't stand you. I hate you too. And then I think we'd be dumbasses to miss out on this second chance. Please, don't say a word or I'll change my mind. - I love you. - So do I. To give him the news, I decided to come home with Boing the second. He immediately understood. Sorry. You know that chicken breast you forget in the fridge? The problem isn't the chicken. At times we're the ones who forgot it and left it to expire. The point is, to give it your best. It's not like I have all the answers now. But now what I see more clearly is that love isn't a game with winners or losers, it's a nasty war. You either win together, or you both lose. Guess we can say I've grown up. It was about time, too.
