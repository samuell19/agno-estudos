I CRANKED OUT A COUPLE OF PAGES ON HOW I WOULD CHANGE THE BREAK TIMES BETWEEN CLASSES TO MAKE OUR LIVES, OH, SO MORE EFFICIENT. THAT'S IT? YES. IT'S A VERY CONVINCING PAPER. WHY? BECAUSE THE WINNING ESSAY WILL BE PUBLISHED IN THE EDUCATION TIMES. WELL, IT WON'T BE MINE. I JUST THOUGHT YOU WOULD'VE COME UP WITH SOMETHING BETTER THAN THAT. YOU ARE THE BEST WRITER IN THE CLASS. HARDLY. ARE, TOO. AM NOT. IF YOU'RE NOT A WRITER, THEN WHY ARE YOU WRITING ALL THE TIME? BECAUSE IF I DIDN'T I'D HAVE A NUTTY. OH, NO. MY PRINTER DIED.

THEY READ YOUR ESSAY IN THE EDUCATION TIMES, AND THEY THINK THAT YOU ARE A GREAT WRITER. LOOK, MOM, I... I JUST DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, THE HUMILIATION HAS JUST DIED DOWN. AND I CAN'T SURVIVE ANOTHER LUNCH OF ZAPPING. JAMIE... THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY. I'D HATE TO SEE YOU PASS IT UP. WELL... I DON'T HAVE ANYMORE PAGES. NO MORE PAGES? WHAT DO YOU CALL THOSE? PERSONAL PROPERTY. I CAN'T DO IT. NO WAY. JAMIE, YOU CAN'T WALK AWAY FROM THIS JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE SCARED. I'M NOT SCARED. I'M NOT SCARED. THEN PROVE IT. OH, HONEY. I AM SO PROUD OF YOU. TRUST ME. YOU WON'T REGRET IT. CAN I GET THAT IN WRITING? MOVE IT, WORM. ZAP, ZAP. HEY, MOM. I CHANGED MY MIND. IF I WRITE A BOOK, THIS ZAPPING IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE. YOU'RE WRITING A BOOK? SOUNDS LIKE A PIPE DREAM TO ME. AH! IN TWO SHORT MONTHS, THE PIPE DREAM HAD BECOME A NIGHTMARE. AND MY PERSONAL, PRIVATE JOURNAL WAS ON ITS WAY TO BECOMING A NATIONAL BEST SELLER. HERE YOU GO, MISS GALLAGHER. THIS IS SO COOL. YOU'RE GONNA BECOME A CELEBRITY. I'LL HAVE TO DO YOUR PORTRAIT. JAMIE. WOULD YOU SIGN MY COPY? UH... NO. SHE'S SIGNING BOOKS!

YOU DON'T THINK THE SIGN HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT, DO YOU? WOW. THIS IS AMAZING. EVEN CHICKEN FEET CAN'T KEEP THEM AWAY. LOOK, CAN WE TALK ABOUT ANYTHING BESIDES THAT STUPID BOOK? HEY, NOW. THE BOOK WAS INCREDIBLE. EMPOWERING. I FELT LIKE I COULD ZAP MYSELF ANYWHERE. DO ANYTHING. I WISH I COULD ZAP MYSELF OFF THE ENGLISH REQUIREMENT READING LIST. HEY, JAMIE. I READ YOUR BOOK. IT WAS... AWESOME. MARCO? WE'RE OVER HERE. I BETTER GET BACK. DO YOU BELIEVE MARCO VEGA READ YOUR BOOK? ONLY CAUSE YOU NAMED THE ROMANTIC IDIOT AFTER HIM. IT IS SHOCKING. I MEAN, WHO KNEW HE COULD READ? HEY, JAMESON. SHE'D NEVER EVEN KNOWN MY NAME IF IT WEREN'T ON THE COVER. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN THEY REALIZE THAT THE EVIL MYRNA AND THE CLONES ARE REALLY THEM? GET OUT. YOU'RE KIDDING. NO. HOW ELSE WAS I SUPPOSED TO COME UP WITH A CHEERLEADER WHO WAS SO VILE THAT MILK CURDLED AT THE SOUND OF HER NAME? DON'T WORRY, JAMIE. AS SELF CENTERED AS THEY ARE, THEY WILL NEVER REALIZE THE CHARACTERS ARE BASED ON THEM. ARE WE IN THE BOOK? YES. YOU ARE LAURA THE INVINCIBLE, AND YOU ARE THE MAGNIFICENT MELODY. BUT THEY'RE ONLY THE COOLEST KIDS IN THE KINGDOM. YEAH. IT'S MOSTLY FICTION. HEY, HOW ABOUT YOU PUT THAT BOOK DOWN AND GIVE ME A HAND. PUT IT DOWN? I'D LIKE TO THROW IT AT HER. COME ON, LENNY. CAN'T YOU BE HAPPY FOR YOUR SISTER? HAVE YOU READ THIS, FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD, BOOK? YEAH. IT'S PRETTY TERRIFIC. NOT IF YOU'RE KENNY THE STINKY TROLL. COME ON, LENNY.

BUT YOU DON'T PAY US, MRS. BARTLETT. I DO NOW. PUT ON THOSE APRONS AND GRAB A PIE. HERE YOU GO. I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY PIZZAS IN MY LIFE. AND I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY HALF EATEN PIZZAS IN MY LIFE. AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO NOTICED THAT MOST OF THE CUSTOMERS PICKED OFF THEIR TOPPINGS? THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE HERE TO SEE JAMIE, NOT EAT PIZZA. AND WILL YOU PLEASE NOT LET MY FATHER KNOW ABOUT THAT. HE'S SO EXCITED ABOUT THE NEW BUSINESS THAT I WOULD HATE FOR HIM TO THINK THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT ME. YOU MEAN US. I MEAN, HER. LET'S JUST CHANGE THE SUBJECT. DID YOU HEAR THAT THE TICKETS GO ON SALE FOR THE DANCE FRIDAY? YOU GUYS GOING? I'M NOT. WHY NOT? YOU HAVE TO. IT'S THE DEEP BLUE SEA DANCE. BUT I DON'T HAVE A DATE. OR A SNORKEL. WELL, NONE OF US DO. I HAVE A SNORKEL. WELL, SINCE NONE OF US HAVE DATES, WHY DON'T WE GO AS A GROUP? THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. I GUESS IT COULD BE FUN. AND I CAN GET MY BROTHER TO DRIVE US IN HIS TRUCK. YEAH. THAT WOULD BE SO MUCH COOLER THAN PULLING UP IN MY DAD'S PIZZA TRUCK. THEN IT'S A DATE. VOLUNTEERS NEEDED FOR THIS YEAR'S DANCE COMMITTEE. OH, HEY, JAMIE, WHAT ABOUT YOU? YOU GUYS, WE SHOULD DO IT. GOOD IDEA. IF YOU'RE GONNA BE ONE OF THE POPULARS, YOU MIGHT AS WELL ACT LIKE IT. WE HAVE TO. HARMONY, YOU ARE SUCH A GREAT ARTIST. AND LINDSAY, NOBODY CAN ORGANIZE THE TROOPS LIKE YOU CAN. YOU GUYS, WE COULD REALLY ROCK THE DECORATING COMMITTEE APART. I DON'T KNOW, I WAS GONNA MOBILIZE A PROTEST AGAINST THE MAKE-UP COMPANY AT THE MALL. WELL, WE CAN DO BOTH. AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A BIG WASTE OF TIME. WHATEVER, VAN GOGH. IT'LL BE LOTS OF FUN, I PROMISE. I'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? RALPH, THIS IS DIANA. HELLO. HI.

HELLO, I'M CHRISTINE BECKLER, AND WELCOME TO RISE AND SHINE. TODAY, I'M VERY PLEASED TO HAVE HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN AND BEST SELLING AUTHOR, JAMIE BARTLETT. IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE. SO HOW DOES IT FEEL TO GO FROM HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN TO BEST SELLING AUTHOR IN ONE SEMESTER? WELL, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF STRANGE THINGS HAPPENING TO ME, BUT AFTER AWHILE, YOU JUST GET USED TO IT. WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT YOUR BOOK, "IS SAVES THE WORLD," IS THE FASTEST SELLING CHILDREN'S BOOK IN SCHILLING PRESS HISTORY. WELL, WE OBJECT TO THE WORD "CHILDREN" BECAUSE IS RELATES TO EVERYONE. WE? I MEAN, ME. RIGHT. YOU'VE SOLD A LOT OF BOOKS. IT'S IN ITS SECOND PRINTING. WOW, DID YOU EVER THINK IT WOULD DO SO WELL? WELL, AS I WAS WRITING "IS SAVES THE WORLD," I FELT AS IF I HAD TAPPED INTO SOMETHING BIGGER THAN MYSELF. AND THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING. AND THAT'S WHAT SCARES ME THE MOST. I'M SORRY, WHAT SCARES YOU? OH, NOTHING. I JUST MEANT THAT PEOPLE CAN REALLY RELATE TO THE STORY, ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE WHY. OH, I DO. IT'S A TERRIFIC STORY. SO TELL US, JAMIE, HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH IT IN THE FIRST PLACE? WELL, MY ENGLISH TEACHER, MISS GALLAGHER, SAID TO WRITE WHAT WE KNOW. WAIT. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT "IS SAVES THE WORLD" IS BASED ON REAL EVENTS? OH, I COULDN'T MAKE THAT STUFF UP. AND THE CHARACTERS ARE REAL AS WELL? OH, THEY'RE VERY REAL. YES. ACTUALLY, SOME OF MY FANS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT IS IS NO MORE THAN AN ALTER EGO OF MYSELF. BUT SHE ISN'T. AM I IS? IS ISN'T. IS SHE? AM I IS? YOU'RE IS? THAT'S QUITE IMPRESSIVE. IS BATTLES EVIL IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE CHAPTER OF THE BOOK. WHAT CAN I SAY? EVIL EXISTS IN MANY DIFFERENT FORMS. AND THE MORE I TALK TO THE KIDS, THE MORE I REALIZE THAT EVERYONE HAS A LITTLE BIT OF IS IN THEM AND EVERY SCHOOL HAS A SAWYER. I'M SORRY. WHO'S SAWYER? HOLY COW. I THOUGHT THE EVIL VILLAIN'S NAME WAS MYRNA. UH-OH. I DIDN'T SAY SAWYER. I SAID MYRNA, RIGHT? NO. YOU SAID... YOU SAID SAWYER. WE HAVE IT ON TAPE. BUT... BUT... OH, NO. WHY DIDN'T I JUST GO AND SAVE A LITTLE CUTE LITTLE BUNNY RABBIT. THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE. OK, THAT'S ALL WE HAVE TIME FOR TODAY. WE THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, MISS BARTLETT. WE WISH YOU TREMENDOUS SUCCESS ON YOUR BOOK. UP NEXT, 7 THINGS IN YOUR TOILET BOWL THAT COULD KILL YOU. RIGHT AFTER THIS. CUT. OK, JAMIE. KEEP IT TOGETHER. ONLY 20 MORE FEET UNTIL YOU REACH YOUR LOCKER. OH! OH, NO! JAMIE BARTLETT, STOP RIGHT THERE. BUSTED. IS PREPARED TO FACE HER DOOM. YOU BASED THAT EVIL WITCH ON ME? I'M SUPPOSED TO BE MYRNA?

I'M GONNA DESTROY YOU BECAUSE THIS IS THE REAL WORLD, JAMIE. YOU CAN'T JUST ZAP ME INTO PERPETUAL DETENTION. ZAP. SHE SPEAKS THE TRUTH. BUT I'M GONNA ZAP YOU RIGHT BACK TO LOSERVILLE WHERE YOU BELONG. LEAVE HER ALONE, SAWYER. OH, YOU'RE DEFENDING HER? HAVE YOU READ HER BOOK? YEAH. WHY? YOU'RE IN IT, TOO. WHO DO YOU THINK THE MUSCLE-HEADED BOZO WITH THE PEA-SIZED BRAIN IS? THAT'S ME? NO. IT'S JOSH. THAT'S SO NOT COOL. SHE WROTE ABOUT ALL OF US. SHE TRASHED ALL OF US. WE'RE THE CLONE HORRIFIC COHORTS? CAN I OFFER YOU A LITTLE PIECE OF ADVICE? YEAH. RUN. YES, DIANA. OH, I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. UH-HUH. I'M JUST GONNA RUN IT BY RALPH, AND I'LL GET BACK TO YOU. OK, WHATEVER IT IS, I'M SURE IT'S NOT A GREAT IDEA. DIANA WANTS TO HAVE A BOOK SIGNING. AT THE PIZZA PARLOR. YEAH. SEE, LIKE I SAID, THAT'S NOT A GREAT IDEA. JAMIE... WHAT'S WRONG? EVERYTHING, MOTHER. IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE END. LENNY! OH, NO. WILL YOU PLEASE DROP THE DRAMARAMA ACT. I'M TOTALLY BORED WITH IT. OH, I'M SORRY, BUT IN CASE YOU HADN'T NOTICED, MY LIFE IS FALLING APART. FALLING APART. HELLO. YOUR LIFE IS JUST BEGINNING. OR HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN SO QUICKLY? WE'RE GOING TO THE DEEP BLUE SEA DANCE WITH MARCO VEGA. WE ARE. WE'RE GOING TO THE... NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. I'M GOING TO THE DANCE WITH MARCO. YOU ARE STAYING HERE. GUESS AGAIN. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD PULL THIS OFF WITHOUT ME? WELL... ANY OF THIS? THE PARTIES, THE FAN MAIL, MARCO VEGA. YEAH, BUT I WAS A GREAT WRITER BEFORE YOU. REALLY? DID YOUR PAPER ON MITOSIS GET YOU ON MAURA LIVE? DIDN'T THINK SO. JAMIE, YOU AND I ARE A TEAM. WE DON'T NEED SAWYER OR THE POPULARS. OUR BOOK IS ON THE NATIONAL BEST SELLER LIST. WE GET TONS OF FAN MAIL EVERY DAY. PEOPLE LOVE US. YEAH. ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW US. WHO CARES AS LONG AS THEY KEEP BUYING THE BOOK. I WOULD RATHER HAVE FRIENDS THAN FANS ANY DAY. YEAH, RIGHT. I WOULD. THAT'S IT. IS IS OVER. I AM NEVER WRITING ANOTHER WORD ABOUT YOU. I WOULDN'T DO THAT IF I WERE YOU. NOW, IF YOU WON'T THINK ABOUT YOURSELF, AND YOU'RE NOT THE GIRL I THINK YOU ARE IF YOU WON'T. THEN THINK ABOUT YOUR PARENTS. BUSINESS IS BOOMING RIGHT NOW. AND LET ME TELL YOU ONE THING, THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE LIVER AND ONION PIZZA. SO IF YOU SAY GOOD BYE TO ME, YOU SAY GOOD BYE TO THE PIZZA PARLOR FOREVER. FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE. IT WAS HAPPENING. IS WAS TAKING OVER. SHE WAS SAYING EVERYTHING I WAS THINKING. UNFILTERED, UNCENSORED, UNPLUGGED. SO WHAT DO YOU SAY? WOULD YOU KNOCK IT OFF. WE'RE TRYING TO SAVE THE FAMILY IN HERE. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. WHAT? I NEED QUIET. OH, I'M SORRY IF MY MUSIC IS INTERRUPTING YOU TALKING TO YOURSELF. YOU CALL THAT NOISE MUSIC? WHY DON'T YOU DO US BOTH A FAVOR AND GIVE IT UP. HEY, THIS ISN'T FAIR AND BALANCED. I NEVER SAID MR. CLARK HAD B.O. 4 COLUMNS OF LETTERS TO THE EDITOR. WHAT KIND OF YELLOW JOURNALISM IS THIS? AND THEY'RE ALL ANTI IS. NO, THEY'RE NOT, JAMIE. THEY'RE ALL ANTI YOU. YOU MIND IF I SIT HERE? YEAH. GO FOR IT. WOW. YOU REALLY KNOW HOW TO SHAKE THINGS UP. IT'S A LITTLE OUT OF CONTROL. IT'S JUST WHAT THIS PLACE NEEDED. HEY, SO, IS MYRNA REALLY BASED ON SAWYER? ONLY A LITTLE. OK. A LOT. THAT'S SO COOL. AND ALL THE OTHER CHARACTERS IN THE BOOK ARE REALLY STUDENTS HERE? KIND OF. SO DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE IS? WELL, SHE'D BE NOTHING WITHOUT ME. AND I'M MARCO VINCENT, RIGHT? YEAH. SWEET. HEY, CONNOR. HEY. WHAT'S WRONG? HAVE YOU TALKED TO JAMIE? NO. AND I DON'T REALLY PLAN ON IT. SHE'S GOING TO THE DANCE WITH MARCO. OH, WHATEV. I'M SO SICK OF HER. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY IGUANAS I BATHED TO GET THAT CAR FOR THE DANCE? HEY. HERE SHE COMES. HEY, GUYS. YOU GUYS... YOU GUYS, YOU HAVE TO HELP ME. ARE YOU SERIOUS? YES. SAWYER'S RUNNING A SMEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST ME. I NEED SOME POSITIVE PR, AND THAT'S WHERE YOU GUYS COME IN. HAVE YOUR HANDLER HANDLE IT. WHAT'S HER DAMAGE? YOU ARE. CONNOR? I GOT LAUNDRY TO DO. BUT... YOU GUYS, I... WELL, I TRIED IT. GOOD IDEA. I CAN TRY SOMETHING ELSE. SHE'S SUCH A MYRNA. COME ON, MARCO. WHY DON'T WE SIT SOMEWHERE ELSE. OH, I NEVER TOLD YOU HOW MUCH I LIKED THAT POEM THAT YOU WROTE. OH... DON'T BRING THAT UP. THAT WAS TOO EMBARRASSING. READING THAT IN FRONT OF THE CLASS. SO LAME. NO, IT WASN'T. I LOVED IT. IT WAS SO... REAL. ARE YOU GONNA EAT THOSE? UH... NO. MMM... WELL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. WE PUT ADS IN ALL THE LOCAL PAPERS. THIS PLACE SHOULD BE A MADHOUSE BY NOW. WELL, BUSINESS HAS BEEN KIND OF OFF SINCE JAMIE'S LITTLE ANNOUNCEMENT LAST WEEK. MAYBE ALL WE NEED IS A NEW PIZZA TO PICK THINGS UP. PICKLE PORK EARED PIZZA, PEG? MAYBE IT'S TIME TO CUT OUR LOSSES. WHERE IS EVERYONE? I MEAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE WE ONLY SOLD TWO BOOKS. IT'S A GOOD THING RALPH'S PARENTS SHOWED UP. OH, GOOD. MMM. WAIT. HERE THEY COME! CUSTOMERS. WE HAVE CUSTOMERS. WHA... WAIT! WAIT! HOOLIGANS. WE HAVE HOOLIGANS. WHAT HAPPENED? I'M BACK. LINDSAY, DON'T SNEAK UP ON ME WHEN I'M WORKING ON OUR MASTERPIECE. YEAH. I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD STUFF OUR MASTERPIECE WITH. OH, I KNOW. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING MYSELF BONKERS. WHAT IS GONNA GIVE OUR WHALE LIFE? NEWSPAPER? FOAM... PACKING PEANUTS? YEAH. ALL GREAT SUGGESTIONS, BUT I WAS THINKING OF SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE PROACTIVE. AND... I KNOW THIS WHALE MEANS A LOT TO YOU, BUT THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A STATEMENT. I CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THINK... IT'LL TAKE OUR CREATION TO THE NEXT LEVEL. TRUE ART ISN'T MEANT TO BE JUST SEEN. IT'S MEANT TO BE EXPERIENCED. YOU CAN'T GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT. YOU HAVE TO SHOW THEM WHAT THEY WANT. WHAT THEY NEED. WAS THAT A YES? THAT WAS A HECK YES. THAT WAS HUMILIATING. LOCAL MARKET'S FICKLE. YOU SAID THAT BUSINESS WOULD PICK UP, BUT IT'S BEEN EMPTY ALL WEEK. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? NOBODY WANTS TO EAT WITH A TATTLETALE. THEY'RE ALL AFRAID OF YOU. NO. THEY'RE AFRAID OF YOU. ME? I'M JUST A FIGMENT OF YOUR IMAGINATION. NO, YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE A MONSTER, AND, AND... AND I AM, TOO. LENNY'S GIVEN UP ON MUSIC BECAUSE OF WHAT WE SAID TO HIM. LENNY, OPEN UP. * THE THINGS THAT YOU SAY * I DIDN'T MEAN THOSE THINGS THAT I SAID YESTERDAY. * NEVER HEAR ABOUT... IT'S NO REASON FOR YOU TO GIVE UP MUSIC. * ...WORD TRAVELS FAST * I'M TELLING YOU TO YOUR FACE * * I'M STANDING HERE BEHIND YOUR BACK * * YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT FEELS * * TO BE OUTSIDE THE CROWD * * YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE * * TO FEEL THAT YOU'RE OUT * AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT FEELS * * TO BE YOUR OWN MESS AGAIN * * ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN * * IF YOU COULD READ MY MIND * * YOU MIGHT SEE * MORE OF ME THAN MEETS THE EYE * * AND YOU'VE BEEN ALL WRONG * * ABOUT WHO YOU THINK I AM * * YOU'VE NEVER GIVEN ME A CHANCE * * YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT FEELS * * TO BE OUTSIDE ALONE * YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE * * TO BE LEFT OUT * YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT FEELS * * TO BE HOPELESS AGAIN * ON THE OUTSIDE AGAIN * NO, NO * I'M TIRED OF STAYING AT HOME * * I'M BORED AND ALL ALONE * I'M SICK OF WASTING ALL MY TIME * * YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT FEELS * * TO BE OUTSIDE THE CROWD * * YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE * * TO FEEL IN DOUBT * YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT FEELS * * TO BE ALONE * ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN * OK, THIS IS GETTING A LITTLE OUT OF HAND. SINCE WHEN DOES THE SPARTAN HAVE 5 PAGES OF LETTERS TO THE EDITOR? HEY, LOOK AT THIS. THEY'RE NOT ALL BAD. CHECK OUT PAGE 8. "THREE CHEERS FOR JAMIE BARTLETT. "SHE DIDN'T LIE OR SLANDER US.

IT'S JUST NICE TO KNOW THAT IN THE FACE OF ALL THIS NEGATIVITY TOWARDS ME, HOWEVER UNWARRANTED AND MEAN IT REALLY IS. IT'S JUST NICE TO KNOW THAT THERE'S SOMEONE OUT THERE WHO KNOWS THE REAL ME. OH, AND MARCO... I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE DANCE. PLUS, I'D RECOGNIZE YOUR STYLE ANYWHERE. WHY, THANK YOU, IS. IT'S JAMIE. RIGHT. SORRY. HEY, SO WHAT TIME SHOULD I PICK YOU UP? WELL, IT WAS FUN WHILE IT LASTED, BUT EVEN LAST MONTH'S INCREDIBLE SALES AREN'T GONNA COVER LAST YEAR'S LOSSES. YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THAT PÖTÉ PIZZA, PEG. LET'S GIVE IT ANOTHER TRY. RALPH, HONEY... ANOTHER INEDIBLE TOPPING ISN'T GONNA SAVE OUR RESTAURANT. THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA COME OUT AHEAD IS BY SELLING THE PIZZA PARLOR NOW. BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. I HATE TO ADMIT IT.

YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TRAPPED IN MY COMPUTER. ARE WE ALL HAVING A GOOD TIME? YOU THINK YOU CAN GET RID OF ME THAT EASILY? WE'RE A TEAM. LIKE ABBOTT AND COSTELLO. MORE LIKE DR. JEKYLL AND MRS. HYDE. YOU MADE ME WHAT I AM TODAY. YES, BUT I WAS THE NICE ONE. I HAD FRIENDS BEFORE I HAD YOU. YOU HAD NOTHING. YOU WERE INVISIBLE. EVERYONE HATED YOU. THAT'S NOT TRUE. THEY HATED WHAT I BECAME. AND I WANT TO THANK ONE SPECIAL GIRL WHO IN SPITE OF TREMENDOUS OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES, TOOK THE TIME TO MAKE ALL THE BEAUTIFUL DECORATIONS IN THE GYM TONIGHT. AND IF CONNOR WROTE THE POEM, THEN HE HAD TO WRITE THE LETTER IN THE PAPER. AND JUST LOOK AT THAT WHALE. CONNOR SEES THE REAL ME. I'VE BEEN SUCH A HORRIBLE FRIEND TO HIM. I HOPE HE'LL FORGIVE ME. JAMIE BARTLETT! GET OUT HERE AND TAKE A BOW. ME? YES. WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL THE GOOD YOU'VE DONE FOR THE SCHOOL. PLEASE. COME HERE. DO YOU REALLY WANT TO HEAR THIS? LET'S JUST PULL IT NOW.
