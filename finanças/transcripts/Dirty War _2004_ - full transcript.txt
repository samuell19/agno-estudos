(car horns honking) (distant sirens wailing) (children chattering) Murray: Foxtrot 5-7-1, now entering third level. Jen: We've got one on the ground. Murray: Okay, you get her out. We'll take this guy. Jen: One, two, three, lift! Got him? Steve, have you got him? Steve: Yes. (panting) Jen: Steve, are you choking there? (Steve grunting) I can't breathe! I can't breathe! I can't breathe! I can't... I can't breathe. Murray: Hang on, Steve. Hang on, I'm coming. Keep your mask on, Steve. Steve, keep your mask on. Don't take your mask off, Steve. Come on, Steve. Man: You're dead! Your team's compromised. Leave your casualties and get your officers to the surface. (distant siren wailing) (men chattering) Come here. Why is it taking so long? The mass decontamination unit was set up in the wrong place. Also, these suits are difficult to work in. So it's taking longer than anticipated to recover the casualties. How many casualties are you using? 60. 60? How many people work in these offices? Two or three thousand. So it's not exactly realistic then. It's manageable, Minister. The press are waiting downstairs, Minister. Thank you. (men chattering) (radio chatter) I need some help here! That's it. We've got you, mate. Murray: You're gonna be okay, mate. Man: All right, let's go. Breathe easy. That's it. Relax. Gonna be okay. Let's get showered and out of these suits. Man: Turn around. And again. Lift your right arm, please. Right arm. Turn around. Okay, good man. Jenny, let's have a look at you. Oh, shit. You're dead too. Why? You've got a tear. Your suit's ripped. Oh, get out, Jenny. It's important that these drills send out a positive message. 1600 gas-tight suits, 7,000 modesty packs, 10 mobile mass decontamination units. The home secretary's concerned that we do everything we can to reassure the public. Understood. It's always worth reminding Londoners how resilient they are. Well, I'll put that in the report, won't I? Okay? This was supposed to be easy. I've got Steve on the way to A&E. Why? Hyperventilation. We're only meant to wear the suits for 20 minutes. It was 16 minutes before we came to the car park. And Jen got a tear. That's what this drill is for, Murray... To iron out these little problems. Biscuits? Male reporter: Minister, Minister, how do you respond to accusations of scare-mongering? Minister: Unfortunately, we live in difficult times and must be prepared for every eventuality. We believe these drills will reassure the British people that we are doing all we can to protect them against terrorism and that London is as prepared as it possibly can be. This is all part of the government's commitment to be honest about the threats we face and to put as much information in the public domain as we can. Female news anchor: The emergency services drill was held in the capital today to test new anti-terrorism measures. The new Minister for London, Nicola Painswick, reassured Londoners that the drill was not linked to any specific threat. West Yorkshire police confirmed that three men were arrested yesterday outside the US Air Force monitoring station at Menwith Hill. The three men are all being held under the anti-terrorism act. Scotland Yard declined to comment on whether the arrests are part a larger operation. It's been a busy morning. Two Irish nationals held at Dover, a gun found in their car. Officers are on their way. The US Intelligence have passed on six names of suspects they want under surveillance. And the three men arrested at Menwith Hill have been confirmed as North African. Commissioner, sir. Thank you. The local police found notebooks and video footage of the perimeter security. And we flagged up two addresses for them in London. What do we know? Well, they could be GSPC. We're waiting for French and Algerian intelligence to get back to us. And MoD want it kept low-key. Fine, you're dealing with that one. Incident room is being set up. Good. Excuse me. Excuse me. (people chattering) (phones ringing) Excuse me, I'm looking for DS Drummer. Just over there. Thanks. DS Drummer? DC Habibullah. Oh, great. I can give you five minutes. You need to get up to speed on the briefing notes. Now we're assuming the suspects are using false IDs. We believe they're North African, possibly Algerian. Also, they weren't acting alone, so our job is to uncover any other cell members. This is your desk here. This is propaganda material... Videos, letters, documents recovered from the B&B in Leeds and the suspects' registered addresses in London. You need to go through all that lot. Most of it's in Arabic. What languages have you got? Urdu, Punjabi, Arabic. Great, 'cause normally I get stuck with a civilian translator. I'll need you with me in interviews. You can help me understand what makes them tick. How would I know? I'm from Luton, Sarge. You're better qualified than I am, Detective. Mike, can I have a word? Yeah. DC Habibullah, this is DI Brook. Sir. Glad you're onboard. Get yourself settled. I'm in A&E. No, no, I'm fine. It's Steve. Can you pop down? Hi, Liz. Hi. (woman over P.A.) Dr. Hussein, please call Radiology. Thank you. Well, hello. Thank you. How is he? He'll live. The drill went well then? I'm finished in half an hour. We could go home together. Yeah. Och, well, I'd better make sure Steve gets back all right. You know, if that had been for real, two of my crew would be dead. Man: Deputy Assistant Commissioner Ives, you have previously stated that we must now expect terrorists to use crude CBRN weapons that could cause mass devastation to this city. Could you explain exactly what that means? We're talking about such things as a dirty bomb, which is simply low-grade radioactive material blown up by a conventional bomb, in other words, low-tech methods for contaminating large numbers of people with deadly agents. Man: Thank you very much. Minister, in a public statement you said that the government is committed to being honest about the threats we face and putting as much information in the public domain as possible. Yes, that is correct. I have in front of me a recent report from the Commons Science and Technology Committee. It accuses the government of being embedded in a culture of secrecy. Forgive me, Minister, but this seems to be a direct contradiction to your statement. (door opens and closes) The government completely rejects the criticism that it is being less open than it need be. We have an active public information campaign. We've sent a booklet to every household in the country with guidelines... Man: But are you confident that the information that you're giving the public is adequate to prepare them for a terrorist attack? Yes, of course. Obviously there are times when disclosure would not be in the public interest. I'm sorry, but now I'm confused. You're open and transparent except when it suits the government not to be. Well, obviously there has to be a balance between truth and reassurance. Are you saying that it's acceptable to lie to the public in order to reassure them? I mean, what the public could be told and the need for secrecy... It's very interesting, Minister, but this report clearly states that this lack of openness has resulted in the public being ill-informed and insufficiently prepared for a chemical, biological or radiological terrorist attack. Deputy Assistant Commissioner, as head of the anti-terrorist branch, do you feel that adequate measures are in place to protect the public? Obviously improvements have been made across all emergency services, but I'd warn against complacency. A great deal of work still needs to be done. Thank you very much. John. That's public record. And I'm not going on public record to say we're fully prepared when we're not. We've allocated 330 million pounds on Homeland Security. That's a huge commitment when the public's demanding hospital beds. What else do you expect us to do? In the States they're spending 15 times more per head than we are, and even they don't think that's enough. Are you saying all the work we're doing, all the plans, new equipment, count for nothing? I'm saying we shouldn't confuse activity with achievement. Out of a force of 30,000, the Met have only 1500 officers with protective suits and two days' training. We'd struggle to deal with a large-scale conventional attack. If a CBRN weapon went off... If it went off, John, if. Nicola, I've seen Al Qaeda's plans for these weapons. With the IRA, we knew 90% of what they were up to, and they still got through. With this lot, we're lucky if we know 20%. It's naive to hope it won't happen. (coughs) How are you? Fine. Okay, this is stamped, marked from Istanbul. All right. (coughing) Are you all right? It's something I ate. Yeah? You want to leave that goulash alone. Cheers. For the other one. The little one. That's it. Cheers. (coughs) (tires screech) (car horn honks) (coughing) Man: Come on, Mr. Rashid. You know, this is a very popular area. There's a post office close by. Also the tubes are five minutes away, buses. And there's a market on Saturday. Show me the cellar. I'll need all this cleared. It'll cost you. How much? 70 quid. (children chattering) We have accommodation for the bride's family. Drummer: This isn't the IRA. With this lot, we don't know who they are, we don't know where they are. We have no inside informants and they don't give warnings. First thing to understand about Islamic terrorist groups... There's no single cell. Don't write it down. Remember it. The logistics cell... These boys will be embedded in the target country. They're likely to be British nationals, so they'll stay low-key. They won't associate with other known extremists. They might not even attend mosque. Rashid: Found a house. Drummer: They raise cash for their group through petty crime like credit card fraud. They provide passports, safe houses, equipment, etcetera. They gather all the elements that make an operation in this country possible. Now the three North Africans at Menwith Hill recently entered the country under false IDs. So they won't be part of logistics cells. Correct. They're obviously checking out the base. Sole purpose of a reconnaissance cell is to gather intelligence on intended targets. They're closer to the planning of an attack and far more likely to be foreign nationals. But neither the logistics nor the reconnaissance cell would be suicide bombers. The attack cell... These boys will be battle-hardened veterans, jihad nutters who fought in Chechnya, Bosnia, Kashmir. Nutters, Sarge? Fanatics, however you want to describe them. They're almost certain to be foreign nationals. They're only brought in at the last stages. And, as we know, in any attack there's likely to be more than one attack cell. Our problem is, none of this lot will know who the other cells are or have any detailed knowledge about the overall operation. But... they all have links to one man. (doorbell rings) Drummer: The agent isn't the mastermind. That person will be thousands of miles away in Pakistan, Afghanistan. (speaking foreign language) The agent is the manager. He puts the cells together and executes the plan. (speaking foreign language) He'll be white-collar, well-traveled, highly educated and have lived in the west for several years. He'll have multiple identities and impeccable cover. Liverpool Street... He could be a doctor, a lawyer, a university professor. The point is, he'll be invisible and skilled at hiding his tracks. So far all we have are three suspects, a possible reconnaissance cell. If we're gonna get the rest of them, we have to chase every person they've ever been in contact with here or abroad, follow every paper trail. Anything that strikes you, however small, let me know. Man: You don't listen to me. (woman chattering) Man: You never listen. (music playing) (doorbell dings) Thank you. Rashid: Thanks. Can I get 20 JPS, please? And a SIM card for my mobile, and a pay-as-you-go top-up card, please. What? Ma... Oh, piss off. Come on, let's go. Yes, I'll hold. Home Secretary wondered how you were settling in. I'm still trying to find my way around, but fine. You had a bit of a grilling at the Defense Select Committee. The chair got turned rather hung up on the issue of public information. May I? Of course. I'll have to call you back. It's an easy issue to present in black and white if you're not making the decisions. Maybe the chair's right. Maybe we're not doing enough to train and prepare the public. If a CBRN attack happens, I'm worried that we could end up with mass panic on our hands. I've been at Whitehall 25 years. There have been at least 80 terrorist attacks on the mainland. Why assume the British public are suddenly gonna start running around like headless chickens? We're talking about suicide bombers now. No warnings, biological weapons, dirty bombs. If you start issuing gas masks to everyone using the tubes, you really do risk causing panic. Al Qaeda wants us scared. The more you fuel public anxiety, the more you play into their hands. I understand that. Think of the economic implications... Business withdrawing from the capital, the tourist industry hit. We've already had local authorities using Madrid to demand extra funds. We don't want knee-jerk reactions from the public as well. What are you saying? Don't you take the threat of a CBRN attack seriously? I'm saying it's a difficult balance. Overreaction can be as dangerous as underreaction. As Minister of London, it's your responsibility to reassure the public and business. Everything is being done to make London as prepared as it possibly can be. It's an issue that's easy to get worked up about from the back benches. Never that simple when you're minister. (backup signal beeping) Sorry. (phone rings) Mogul Prince takeaway. Speaking. Uh-huh. Yeah. Will you be there after midnight? Bye. (man over P.A.) Train now arriving at platform 4, 1715... (indistinct) (P.A. system dings) (woman announcing over P.A.) (knocks on door) Why am I getting calls from Customs? What? They want to know why one of my officers is inquiring about D&L Shipping. It's one of the names I came across in the suspects' notebooks. I ran them through NCS database. I told you to let me know. Sorry. You're right. Did Customs tell you what their interest is? They believe Turkish mafia are using D&L as a smuggling drop. Shit, it would be Customs. Any chance they'd let us look at their phone records and their shipping manifests? They're not gonna rush to share information. They're months into a major investigation. It's only paperwork. You must know someone that owes you a favor. I'll talk to Brook. I've run out of favors. (rings doorbell) Salam alaikum. (speaking foreign language) Salam alaikum. Wa-alaikum as-salam. Have you everything you need? For now. We need a large lead sheet to make a hatch... Just a precaution. Right you are. Come upstairs. I'll introduce you properly to your brothers. Got any plans tonight? Why? Have we heard from Customs? You must be joking. Come on, you can leave that. Oh, check he hasn't spiked it. So, Sameena, if they're not nutters, what's it all about? Are you being serious? We can talk about football, if you like. What, do you mean blowing themselves up, fundamentalism? What? All of it. I mean, if your family is killed right in front of you in Chechnya, it might crush your mind, but why would a third-generation kid brought up in Bradford want to join Al Qaeda? Well, it doesn't matter if you're brought up in Bradford or in Saudi. If you're Muslim, you're part of a wider family. What happens in Chechnya, Kashmir or Palestine is happening to you. It's a long way from that to strapping explosives to yourself. Yeah, but what these boys see makes them angry. And extremist groups exploit that anger. They recruit men from all over the world, get them into training camps and focus that anger. It's brainwashing. They hand them a Kalashninkov, convince them it's their holy duty to die in the defense of Islam. So now instead of five martyrs, hundreds step forward. How do you feel about that? Pissed off. These fanatics... They're just a tiny minority. And people think we're all like that. I take my faith seriously. I care about what's happening in the world. But you don't see me strapping explosives to myself, do you? So that's why you joined the police? No, I wasn't clever enough to be a doctor. (phones ringing) (people chattering) Sameena. Phone records and shipping manifests from D&L Shipping, courtesy of our friends at Customs. Good hunting. Sameena, see you in the morning. Yeah. Painswick: Even before the terrible events in Madrid, London's emergency services were being prepared for a major terrorist attack. Under our "New Dimensions" initiative, London Fire Brigade have now been equipped with extended life breathing apparatus. They have over 1600 gas-tight suits and new radiation dosing meters in all engines. Senior officers are receiving state-of-the-art training in Texas. And there are 10 mobile mass decontamination units established right across the capitol. The success of the recent drill is a clear demonstration of how capable London's emergency services are in dealing with incidents of major contamination. Who's been telling her this? Of course, we can't afford to be complacent, but London is now better prepared than it has ever been. Thank you very much. Ives: Minster, this is Commander Paul Hardwick, He's one of our gold commanders in charge of GT control room. Commander. Pleased to meet you, Minister. Very interesting speech. Minister, were you at the same drill I was? Sorry, you are? I'm sorry. I'm Murray Corrigan, watch commander, London Fire Service. That drill was a farce, wasn't it? Have you ever worn a GT suit? You can't work in them. They're unwieldy. You boil. What you're asking us to do with this equipment is totally unreal. We've had a lot of problems with our kits. Clive Phelps, London Ambulance Service. Half our suits were defective. We had to send them back. When we put the decon showers on, the heads blew off. I appreciate your concerns. That's why we're doing drills. Well, that wasn't a drill. It was a PR stunt... Controlled conditions, police cadets as your casualties. We're constantly reviewing our plans. Well, exactly. They're your plans. I have never been consulted. Murray. I have never been invited to any strategy meetings. I haven't even seen your new major incident procedures. Well, I'm sure you'll appreciate that we have to limit access to these plans in the interests of national security. What a fucking great excuse for incompetence. Harper: I'm very sorry, Minister. I understand. Change can be very unsettling. With respect, my officers trained as firemen. Now they're expected to be the front line in your war on terror. They're putting their lives at risk, and none of us know if your plans work. Excuse me. Man: Salam. We have the barrels. Around the back. What did he say? Take it around the back. I used to really look forward to go to work. They're perfectly happy to spend billions on Iraq, MI5, a sexy new British FBI. You'd think they could spend a bit more on us. Still, the rumor is that the first officers in are expendables. Maybe that's why they don't want to waste their money. If you really believe that, perhaps you should get out. But whatever you decide to do, I'll support you. Hey! (man whistles) Good morning. So what happened? Well, what have you heard? (Harper over P.A.) Would Murray Corrigan please report to the station commander's office now? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Man: Ooh. I'm expecting a call any minute demanding I put you on charges. I'll be a watch commander down, right? We've already lost two senior officers this year. Bollocks. I'm resigning anyway. (man over P.A.) Mobilize, mobilize. Foxtrot 571, Foxtrot 572. (man continues announcing) Sameena: Three calls to an address in Leeds, nothing logged, local are looking into it. Seven calls to an address in Kentish Town, flagged, NCS already investigating. We're talking to them. One call to an address in Neasden, the Mogul Prince takeaway, logged. A Muslim neighbor called the anti-terrorist hotline complaining about the two men that live above the takeaway. Might be something. In a statement, she describes them as fanatics. Do we know who they are? We're running checks. I can send an officer over to talk to her, get more details. You'll go. She'll find it easier talking to you. Thanks. Did you get the number? No. In your statement you said that they were moving barrels. Anything else makes you suspicious? You described them as fanatics to the anti-terrorist hotline. I don't trust them. Something in the way they behave? What did they say? You understand? Ji. We're rare. But they're proud. Phillips: Rashid Dhar and Imran Nazir, both registered at 66A Craven Lane, both claiming social security benefit, both British nationals. Neither has a record and neither has been associated with any extremist groups, as far as we know. Check with provincial forces, see if there's anything else. Any travel detail? They've both had multiple entry visas for Pakistan and Saudi. That doesn't necessarily mean anything. It could be family trips, pilgrimage to Mecca. Half my relatives would be suspects based on that. You're the one asking for intrusive surveillance. There's other leads we could be chasing. Yes or no? My instinct is that the woman is right about them. Fine. ♪ ♪ Murray: He's got the steering wheel in his ribs, and I'm saying to him, "There's no other way for me to get you out of here, mate." God, was he all right? Oh, he'll be fine. Anyways, there he is, he's trapped in his car. His phone's ringing. He starts looking for it. And he answers it. And it's his girlfriend. And she's in a restaurant waiting for him. They're supposed to be having lunch or something. And he says, "No, look, love, I'm trapped in the car. I can't get out. I've got a fireman chopping me out of it." She doesn't believe him, goes off on one. So he hands it to me. And she's absolutely furious. Now I've never had anything like it in my life. What, with him, for being late? No, for crashing the car. Oh. It's her car. Did she calm down? Eventually. Anyway, I saved him. I saved his relationship. I killed the car. My hero. So you're not resigning then? Well, what else would I do? Decorate the kitchen, fix the guttering. Oh, yeah. Look, I'm sorry I was so down. It's okay. I understand. I work for National Health. (chuckles) Liz: Hi. Man: Good evening. Welcome, welcome. (Indian music playing) Salam alaikum,brother. Wa-alaikum as-salam. I hope you're well. And I hope your family is well. I'm sorry, I don't understand. I want you gone by Monday. Why Monday? You have done your job well. (man over radio) Unknown leaving. Repeat, unknown leaving. Sameena: Stay with original target. Sameena: This is where he wipes his cup. I'd say the stranger is his superior. You saw the way he behaved when Dhar stood. Have we done any DNA? Forensics has the cup. What are the chances of getting an ID from the photo? It's with 5 and 6. And it could take up to 48 hours before we hear back. Brook: What do we know? We found a reference for D&L Shipping in one of the North Africans' notebooks. A phone call was logged from D&L to Mogul Prince takeaway. Dhar and Nazir both work there. An eyewitness saw them unloading metal barrels at night. Customs believe D&L is used by a lot of foreign outfits. Are we just looking at a couple of petty crooks smuggling IDs? Phillips: They're clearly devout and disciplined. We've identified extremist literature on their shelves. They're careful to cover their tracks. All this suggests that they've been trained. Have we found the logistics cell for the North Africans? No, I don't think so. Why not? These boys are Pakistani. They operate through different networks. So you're saying we could have stumbled upon a logistics cell for a completely separate operation? Yes, sir. Shit. We'll have a better idea when we know who he is. If the lion wants to suddenly come and go, "Grr!" do you think the camel or the lion would be more stronger? (speaking Arabic) Aww. Bye-bye. (man on TV) There is deepening concern around the world about the rising violence in Iraq. Faced with continued unrest... (men speaking foreign language) (radiation meter crackling) These canisters all contain radioactive material in powder form. These smaller ones contain alpha sources. This you can handle safely. It's only dangerous if you get it on your skin or you inhale it... (inhales) breathe it in. Now you must wear these masks when you work with it. These larger ones contain gamma radiation. This is much more dangerous. In this concentration, as soon as that lid is open, you've got 60 seconds. After that, it's going to make you very, very sick. Do you understand? Both: Yes. And the whole operation shouldn't take more than four minutes. Mafhoum? Mafhoum. (watch beeps) (watch beeps) Sorry to drag you in. How long is this gonna take? I've got the boys downstairs. There's a chance that radioactive material has been smuggled into the country. A body was found in Bulgaria last Tuesday. He's been identified as Usman Selcuk, a Turkish shipping agent and a suspected smuggler. Been exposed to a fatal dose of gamma radiation. Now we know at least 50 different shipments left his man's depot in Sofia one week prior to his death. The shipments were destined for 17 different countries. The UK is among them. Why are we worried? We think we might have found a logistics cell with links to the same Turkish smuggling cartel. His body was discovered five days ago. Why are we just getting the information now? The intel went to 5. They didn't consider it a priority. Oh, God. All right, thank you. (phone beeps) Get me DI Lane and DS Drummer. (device crackling) Did you put the lids back on? The lids... are they on? No. (switch clicks) (device beeps) (device crackling) (watch beeps) Shit. (device crackling) (watch beeps) (knocks) Close the hatch. Close the hatch. (device crackling rapidly) Brook: 5 have identified the man who met with Rashid Dhar as Ahmed Ibrahim Abassi. He's a Jordanian management consultant registered as mature student at London University, living here in the UK with his wife and child. He's also lived in Cairo, Hamburg and Paris. Now his credentials seem legitimate, but we do know that he accepted passports from Dhar and that he took the trouble to wipe his fingerprints. Do we know where he is? Only a previous address. We're trying to get a current one from the college. We do have another problem. Surveillance team on Dhar and Nazir say they're packing up, possibly destroying evidence. Should we pick them up? I'd prefer to keep watching. We're confident they're not an attack cell, so let's just see where they take us. How serious is the radiation threat? Well, we've no direct evidence that radioactive materials are being smuggled into this country. Has anything come up on the radiation detectors in the ports? No, but there's been no intel. They check 10%-20% of the cargo. Even if the dead Turk was smuggling a gamma source, there's no proven link to him and Nazir and Dhar. I mean, the material could have gone to any number of clients. 643 instances of radiation trafficking in the last six years, and they're the ones we know about. Brook: And with no specific intel suggesting a dirty bomb threat to the UK. Have we gone back to 5 and 6? Are they certain about that? Well, we are trawling all intelligence noise, just in case they'd missed something. I'm not happy that Dhar and Nazir are packing up. I want their flat turned over, and D&L Shipping. I'll square it with Customs later. Take CBRN teams. And pick up Abassi, before tomorrow, if possible. If we spook him and lose him, that's the risk I'll have to take. (man speaks Arabic) (man speaks Arabic) (men shouting) Armed police! Armed police! (policemen continue shouting) Lie down! Lie down! Stay there! Look at the light! Hands on your back. Look at the light. Stay there. Now move! Where's your mate now? (police radio chatter) Imran Nazir, I'm arresting you under the Terrorism Act. Rashid Dhar, I'm arresting you on suspicion of terrorist activities under the... Slow down. I want to chat first. Bag these separately, okay? No sign of those barrels anywhere? That's funny, 'cause we know you picked them up. What was in the barrels, Rashid? Where are they now? Sameena: We know you only started packing yesterday. Why the hurry? What did Abassi tell you to do? (spits) (man announcing over P.A.) (alarm blaring) (tires screech) What was that? What the fuck was that? (man over P.A.) Mobilize, mobilize. Foxtrot 571, Foxtrot 572. There's a major incident... (man over radio) A large explosion in the vicinity of Liverpool Street station. Dispatch pump engines to investigate. Foxtrot 571 responding. (alarm blaring) (pager beeping) (phone ringing) (phone ringing) Man: We've lost all the live feed from camera... Ives: What just happened, Paul? There's a large explosion, Liverpool Street. Could be gas, plane down or a bomb. We're still trying to contact city police at Bishopsgate. Got a visual, north end of Bishopsgate, on 2. (man over speaker) Probable incendiary device. Can confirm ground zero is Liverpool Street. God. Repeat, ground zero is Liverpool Street. Shit. Blue Lights can expect mass casualties... Has anyone checked for contamination? (car alarms ringing) Foxtrot 571 to Control, mobile to incident. ETA approximately two minutes. Repeat, ETA two minutes. Over. (yells) Stop the engine, Ralph. (devices beeping) Get your BA sets on now. Foxtrot 571 to Control. Dosing meters alarming. Repeat, dosing meters alarming. Radiation suspected, reading 26 millisieverts. Holding position. Over. (Control over radio) Foxtrot 571 from Control. Recalled, recalled. Murray: Foxtrot 571 to Control. We have suspected mass casualties. We have serious fire hazards. We need all services at the site ASAP. We have a major incident. Repeat, major incident. Control: Control to Foxtrot 571, blast site radioactive. Repeat, all units recalled immediately. Repeat, recalled. Foxtrot 571. Status two received. Back up! Jen: Keep moving, everyone. Follow the engine. Guys, we're being recalled. We've got to get out of here. Woman: Sir, Fire Control report that several units approaching the site are reporting high levels of radiation. Reports are from multiple entry routes surrounding incident... North Bishopsgate, London Wall, Houndsditch, corner of Threadneedle and Bishopsgate. Hardwick: Get that helicopter back. Tom, get onto the bomb squad, find out what we're dealing with. Is it just radiation in this bomb? How bad is it? I need dirty bomb plans on all terminals. I need safe sites for marshalling area. No more emergency vehicles are to enter the site. Officers: Sir. Any personnel already committed are contaminated. They must withdraw to a safe distance and stay put till we know where to set up decon. The bomb's definitely contaminated. We've got high levels of radiation on site. No, I don't know what else... Woman: Any fire officers reach ground zero? Hardwick: Tom, get me fire, ambulance, military liaison here now. Make sure number 10 is informed. And see how long it will take government liaison to get here. Sarge, they want to know where to withdraw to. Tom: Tell them 400... no, 500 meters. And tell them to stay put until further notice. All units are to withdraw to 500 meters... We need all potential target locations cordoned and cleared. If it's suicide bombers, we have to expect secondary devices. Sergeant, any way I could look at CCTV footage of Liverpool Street before the onset? Hang on a minute. We can't play that back from here, but I can patch you through to the surveillance suite on Water Street. Joe. It's line 1, the bomb incident room. Sir, ambulance want to know what they should do with casualties. They should take casualties to hospital and take contamination with them. If it's life or death, it's the ambulance's call. But they must liaise with hospital A&Es. Sir, what about the casualties trapped at ground zero? We'll deal with that later. Yeah, go ahead. Man: Move along, please. Just move along. Move back. Move away from the area. Move away from the area. What's going on? Move back, please. What's going on? Just get back. Where to? Just get back now, please. Move away. That way, sir. That way. Go with everybody else. Keep moving, please. Please keep moving. (man over speaker) All fire ground personnel returning from incident must go through decontamination before entering marshalling area. Okay. Yeah? All right. Thanks, Steve. Name. Murray Corrigan. Corrigan. Rank. Watch commander. Dosing meter reading. 43. 43. You're clean. Okay? Yeah. Yeah? I heard you guys got a mobile that works. No. No? Are you all right? Let me help. No way. You have to leave your car. Man: Go the other way. Keep it moving. No one here has been able to confirm that the bomb is radioactive. But it's obvious here that there is fear of some form of contamination. As you can see behind me, police are moving people back from the area as quickly as they can. But we don't know if this is merely a precaution or whether the blast was in fact some kind of dirty bomb, as you say. Is this you, you bastard? Reporter: We were unable to get closer than 400 yards to the site of the blast. But what's even more alarming is that emergency vehicles are being held back... Man: Understood. Hold the line. Sir. Yes? Liverpool Street are holding all trains on the line outside the station. They want to know where to disembark the passengers. Tell them to hold. No one should leave the area without decontamination. Tom, what's the weekday population of the square mile? Over 300,000. But if you include the surrounding residential areas, closer to a million. Get back to me on that as soon as you can. Are you sure? This lady needs a hospital. Go to the front. Can you help this lady? You can't stay here. You've got to move back. I've got seriously injured people, mate. The instructions are to leave the casualties that can't move. Well, do you want to tell them that? We're not going anywhere till we get some proper medical assistance. Prat. Woman: Help me! Come on, follow me. Keep moving. (man over phone) Okay, I've got an image outside Liverpool Street station. Man: Sir. Tell me what you're seeing. (man over phone) It's a white transit van. Two people in the cab. Can't see the registration. Whoa. Shit. What? They were in the van when it went up, sir. Just checking another camera to see if we can get the number plate. White van, suicide bomber. You need to check for any suspect vehicles. Under no circumstances must an officer approach. Both: Sir. Okay, officers on streets... Yeah, I need a direct patch to surveillance cameras covering Canary Wharf... ...on high alert for any suspect vehicles... Isle of Dogs, Tower Bridge... ...particularly white vans, parked white vans with drivers. (man over phone) Confirmed two people in the van number plate X-ray, 334, X-ray, Bravo, Romeo. Houses of Parliament, Parliament Square, Oxford Street, Central London, Westminster Bridge. X-ray, 334, X-ray, Bravo, Romeo. Confirm. Correct. Put this number plate through the ring of steel camera. It will give us the face of the driver. (man over phone) Hang on, I've got something else. They swapped drivers. There were three people in the van. They've switched drivers inside the ring of steel. (man over phone) The original driver got out on Bishopsgate. Sir. We know this man. I'm sending you a photo... a man known as Ahmed Ibrahim Abassi. I'll need an all-ports now. He's probably using false ID. Get onto DS Drummer. (grunting) You can go if you want. Where is Abassi? What's he planning? What's the next target? Sarge, fire and ambulance need to know where to send their mass decon units. We've got to establish hot and cold zones first. Just give me a moment. Sir, how the hell are we gonna do this? We're getting wildly different readings from all over the place. Alan, Alan, what does it say in the procedure? Fragmentation. It says it's vital to make fragmentation distance assessment to allow for eddies and microclimate differentiation. What the fuck does that mean? Mark, where is the science officer? Still struggling to get in, sir. Get him on the radio. Alan, get onto the met office, find out which way the wind's blowing. Woman: Sir, fire are getting reports of numerous casualties still trapped at ground zero. (man over radio) India 99 to Control. We now have secondary fires in surrounding buildings. Maintaining safe distance. Over. (man over speaker) All units must await further instructions. No vehicles are to enter the site. So what's the plan? Why the hell are we just standing here? We're on hold, but working on it. We've got suits and breathing apparatus. We should be back in there. All units are recalled, Murray. We still don't know exactly what we're dealing with. Well, we should go there now. There are people alive in there, and we've abandoned them. And we don't do that. (man over radio) ...as yet unknown. Man #2: We can't give you an estimate on the casualties. We have no officers on the ground. We'll give you an approximation as soon as we can... I can't reach Liz. All units must await further instruction. All the networks are down, mate. I'm sure she'll be fine. Man: All personnel to report... Let me stress right now, sir, that for someone who was not caught at the blast, who is away from the site of the blast itself, such a person is at very little risk to health... Mark: Understood. Hold the line. Sir, science officer says they're getting both alpha and gamma radiation readings. No one should be deployed in the hot zone without full CBRN protection. Understood. People should cover their faces with whatever they can. They should cover any cuts and abrasions. Alan: Sir, St. Luke's and Mile End hospitals are being overwhelmed by self-presenters coming out of the hot zone. The crowd is contaminated. Hospitals requesting police assistance to hold them back. Tell them they'll have to wait. Tom, can we spare the manpower? The inner cordon's a kilometer diameter. So for the outer cordon we'll need over 1000 officers. How many have you actually got with suits? 500, mostly TSG. Military liaison say they can mobilize a couple of hundred troops within the hour. That's the last resort. I don't want a soldier on a civilian cordon. The most important thing for anyone caught inside the hot zone, it's to be decontaminated before trying to go home to their families. Otherwise they risk taking, of course, the radioactive contamination back to their families... Hardwick: Contaminated people are getting out. Suits or not, we have to contain this. Listen up. I want manned barriers at 2000 meters. Filter everyone in that area into decon cordons. Try to hold those lines. No one to cross until mass decon is set up. Understood? Sir. They're afraid they might have been contaminated, exposed to radiation, and they simply want help. I'll be far more useful down there. They need to see a government face on the front line. Reporter: Most of the staff here are insisting they can only treat the serious casualties. They're actually refusing entry to the many minor injuries caused by flying glass. Someone has to reassure them. Basically there's a lack of clear information... The press are already at the cordon. ...which, in turn, as you can see, is fueling an awful lot of anger. Anchor: Thank you, Jonathan. Great. We're just receiving reports... Bye. Confirming that all emergency vehicles have been withdrawn from what they're calling ground zero. (man over phone) Confirm, van at Telecom Tower has two people in cab. The number plate for Canary Wharf van not registered. The number plate's a dead end, sir. We're getting reports for third suspect van parked with driver, Perksway between Abbey Orchard Street and St. Peter Street. Perksway between Abbey Orchard Street and St. Peter Street. Back of the DTI, Westminster. Back of the DTI, Westminster. (man over phone) Coming onscreen now. Okay, can you tilt down? Man: Further. Can you zoom in further? Ives: Is that the best we can get? Can you get another camera on it? Sorry, Mr. Ives, we really need you to make a statement. Man: Lower angle. That's the best they've got, sir. I want SO19 in place, with riflemen where possible. Keep watching them, but no one is to approach those vans. If they are suicide bombers, the slightest thing spooks them and they'll detonate. Sir. What else have they got planned? Ma'am. Drummer: How many devices are there? How many devices are there? Sarge, the tenancy agreement. 46 Churchill Avenue, Willesden Green, three months paid in advance. What's there, Rashid? Take Phillips and whoever's still here from SO19. Come with me. (man on TV) We are live now from Scotland Yard, where we're expecting a statement from the Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Ives on the anti-terrorist... Phillips, come with me. And you. A large bomb hidden in a van was detonated at 8:00 A.M. outside Liverpool Street station. We believe that the bomb might have been used to disperse small amounts of radioactive contamination. Guys, guys, I need you. Which is why every necessary precaution is being taken. In the meantime, we need the public to stay calm and to stay put. If you're already in your home, stay in your home. If you're in your office, please remain there. All Londoners not in the vicinity of the incident should go in, stay in and tune in. (Ives over speakers) There is no significant risk to your health, but it is vital that you are decontaminated before you go home. Mass decontamination units... (continues indistinct) (backup signal beeps) (distant siren wailing) Sir, mass decon units have been dispatched to the cordons at London Wall, Commercial Road, London Bridge, Old Street. Priority routes are filtering everyone still inside the zone to these four points. Tom, how long are we gonna have to hold people there? Uh, we've got 10 mass decon units in London, more en route from the regions. But assuming fire and water can get them up and running in half an hour, they're supposed to do about 200 people an hour? So how many people are we talking about? 100,000, 200,000. I don't know how many people are still in there. That's 10-12 hours minimum. Right, we'd better organize food and drink. You can't do that. They mustn't put their hands near their mouths... No smoking, no eating, no drinking. They could ingest radiation. Has anyone told them that? Well, haven't you? Woman: Sir, we've got a major problem. Fires are burning out of control at ground zero. Man: We have no idea how bad the situation is at ground zero, so officers must wear GT suits. Man #2: Suits don't give protection against gamma. That's what the dosing meters are for. Now we should expect concentrated pockets of gamma radiation close to the blast site. That means officers are gonna have to check their meters every minute. And what's the maximum dose? Female officers can't risk exposure to radiation at all. We can only ask male officers to volunteer to take up to 100 millisieverts. Anything above that's at their own risk. How do we get men in from this distance on that time scale? Well, we could use engines that are already contaminated to drive relays. Yeah, but it's gonna be hard getting the engines close. There's rubble everywhere. They'd be lucky to last longer than 20 minutes in those suits. So the first officers in are gonna need to know the ground. You and your men have already received half the maximum dose. So the reliefs better get in faster. Harper: How many men do we have available right now? A couple of hundred that we can ask to get suited up. Now the traffic's gridlocked. The majority of the force is struggling to get here. If you want it, you're first in. You'd better talk to your crew. (men shouting) Armed police! Armed police! (continue shouting) (Ives over speakers) Everyone should stay calm. There is no significant risk to your health, but it is vital that you are decontaminated before you go home. Pregnant women, children and any casualties should report to the front. It is in your best interest to refrain from eating, drinking, smoking, placing your hands in your mouth prior to decontamination. Everyone should stay calm. There is no significant risk to your health, but it is vital that you are decontaminated before you go home. Good morning, Minister. I've been asked to be your liaison officer this morning. Could you bring me up to speed? What's going on here? Yes, we estimate a crowd of several thousand people behind the cordon in need of immediate decontamination. Right. The process now of setting up the decontamination units... Literally a couple of minutes before we're ready to get the decon unit open, on its way, to bring people through there ASAP. Man: The house is secure. We have one casualty... One suspect dead. (man over radio) Roger. Understood. Ambulance en route. Medical team en route. (device crackling) This man is hot. The whole house is hot! We've got to get out. Clear the house! We've got to get out now. Clear the house. Clear the house! (man announcing over speakers) Murray, Murray, when your dosing meter gets to 100, you come out. Do you understand? Yeah. Corrigan. Wharton. Ashworth. Ashworth. Okay. Man: Okay? (man over radio) First unit... We need a decontamination team down here before any one can go in and check forensics. Give me the radio. Sir, this is DC Habibullah. I'm looking at a rental agreement for a white transit van, registration Oscar, Uniform, 5-3, Sierra, Foxtrot, Foxtrot. Yeah. No, that's not the van that detonated. Sir, they've recovered documents for a rented van. White Ford transit, registration Oscar, Uniform... Oscar, Uniform... 5-3... 5-3... Sierra, Foxtrot, Foxtrot. Sierra, Foxtrot, Foxtrot. That's not the Canary Wharf van. Does anyone have a visual on the number plates of suspect vehicles at Westminster and Telecom Tower? (speaking Arabic) Allahu akbar. (starts engine) Yallah. (man over radio) Van 1 on the move. That's our van. (man #2 over radio) Go, go! Man #1: Local in shot, target obscured. (quietly) Take it. Man #1: Do not approach vehicle. Do not approach vehicle. Our target's down. Our target's down. Man #2: Confirm target down. No movement. Repeat, no movement. (man over speakers) Please wait patiently. Mass decontamination has begun. Everyone will go through as soon as possible. Your patience is appreciated. Man: Don't cross the line. Don't cross. (man over speakers) Please wait patiently. Mass decontamination has begun. Everyone will go through as soon as possible. Your patience is appreciated. Please zip up. Put your mask on. Come through. Man: Next. Stop, please. Close your eyes. (man over radio) Foxtrot 571, this is entry controller. What's your status? Over. Murray: We have severe casualties, civilians trapped. We need heavy lifting gear. Controller: Understood. More units are en route. What's your dosing meter reading? Murray: Hang on. 250. Repeat, 250. Controller: You're over your limit. You can take your crew out now. Murray: Negative. We can't pull out now. We need more men. (all shouting) Surely we need another mass decon unit here. All the decon units in London are committed, Minister. Can't we get hold of any more? We have more en route from other parts of the country, but we're not sure when they'll get here. Minister: Hello. (reporters clamoring) I'll take every question that you have for me. We're getting some really high radiation readings. How high? Very high. Alan: Radiation has spread east by northeast with prevailing winds. Alert, Mile End hospitals and all medical units in the area be advised radiation is spreading. Do not let people leave the hospital buildings. Woman: Sarge, London Wall cordon reports radiation readings are 50 millisieverts. They want to relocate mass decon to a safe distance. No, negative. Hold position. Oh my comms, please. Woman: Transfer. Extra manpower is on its way to assist. Do not dismantle your decon until you have their backup. Whatever happens, you must hold that cordon line. If the perpetrators of this dreadful evil think that they can demoralize and intimidate us, they are wrong. Londoners have coped with terrorist attacks many times before. (sirens wailing) We are doing everything we can to protect and inform people... Sorry to interrupt this. I need to ask you to move. Decon is being relocated. You need to move. (people shouting) Man: Keep back! Keep back! (man over speakers) There will be a short delay while the mass decontamination facility is re-sited. Please stay calm. We will resume decontamination as soon as possible. Your cooperation is essential. There will be a short delay while the mass decontamination facility is re-sited. Please stay calm. We will resume decontamination... Minister, radiation levels are rising. You must leave. Please, minister. (crowd chanting) We must go! We must go! We must go! We must go! We must go! We must go! Please remain calm. Please stay back. It's in your own interest... Crowd: We must go! We must go! (man over speakers) Decontamination will resume as soon as possible. Please remain calm. (man over speakers) Attention, all fire ground personnel. High levels of radiation are suspected. Immediate withdrawal. I repeat, immediate withdrawal. Murray, this is Harper. Steve, check your air supply. Okay. Check your gauge. Foxtrot 571 to entry controller. (woman over radio) Go ahead. Murray: We're running out of air. We've got to contain this. Woman: Help me! Murray: We need more men. Where are my reliefs? Murray, this is Harper. There's a delay. Marshalling area is having to relocate. We're pulling back. We'll advise on new location. You have to get out of there now. (woman wailing) Harper: Murray, are you receiving? Murray, do you copy? Murray: Situation understood. Get out, Steve. Get out. I'll spot it. (people chattering) (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) Are you ready for this? Ahmed Ibrahim Abassi, also known as Nabil Kasim, also known as Abu Azim, born Hanif Abbash, Amman, Jordan, June 17th, 1971. Pakistani ISI are holding your wife. Your son Abdullah, as far as we know, is in an orphanage. Your son has no family to claim him. Do you care what happens to him? He's four years old. You decided his fate. You killed those people, not Allah. Slaughtering innocent men, women and children is not defending the brotherhood. It is a crime against Islam. And what happens now? The West retaliates. Thousands more Muslims will die. We expect your retaliation. It is what unites us and divides you. Hi, could you tell me where the ICU unit is, please? Yeah, down there. Follow the corridor, on your left. Your husband has made good progress. You need to understand there will be long-term effects. But good news is that Murray should be able to come home in the next couple of weeks. We'll make regular outpatient's appointments, but you should be alert for any signs of melanoma... Tumors, skin lesions, any unusual changes to the skin. I'm afraid there may be problems if you want to have children. We have consultants here. If you like, you can talk to them and they'll explain the risks involved. Do you understand? Female reporter: The death toll as a direct result of the city bombing has been confirmed at 375, although some medical experts warn that there could be thousands of long-term cancer deaths as a result of exposure to radiation. Male reporter: Scientists from the Atomic Energy Agency have announced that three and a half square miles of Central and Eastern London may have to remain sealed off for as long as 30 years. Male reporter #2: Thousands of businesses caught in the contamination zone have been forced to close. Millions in pensions, savings and trust funds may never recover. As London house prices continue to plummet, analysts warn the the full cost of the bombing is impossible to calculate. Female reporter #2: In the hunt for the ringleaders of the dirty bomb attack, British police say they have received unprecedented cooperation from all international intelligence services. Later in the program we'll be talking to the head of... Female reporter #3: The Prime Minister vowed that the government will not rest until all the terrorists who threaten the civilized world are brought to justice. ♪ ♪ (music playing)
