It happens when you don't take a mulligan on every shot. No one expects you to get all the fine points of the game. We all know you didn't grow up playing in... where was it again, Missouri? Mississippi. [laughs] Geography. Anyhow, looks like you're going to be on this hole a while. Mind if we play through? Actually, I do mind. I've got to get going since the GGA luncheon is next weekend. Maybe you forgot since you're not hosting it this year. I have tons to do. Oh, don't overthink it, Mags. A couple cases of Chardonnay and everyone will be happy. Keep those clubs away from me. [doorknob rattles] Seriously. [knocking] Oh, uh... Hey, Eve. Hey, Dad. Uh, the pool party ended so early? Uh, no. I was... [phone vibrates] I was just cold. What's the matter honey, you sick? No, I'm fine Mom, really. Did you have fun? Actually, yeah. I met this really cool sophomore girl from NYU and she invited me to an orientation party there. A party in New York? Yeah, I need to check out the social scene. You haven't even gotten in yet. I know, in case I do. You're not going to a party in New York alone. It'll be fine, I'll stay with the girls. There's gonna be other freshmen there. Eve, you're not going to NYU. Get that idea out of your head. Why not? Because it's 3,000 miles away. USC is right here, okay? It's a real college campus, and... Football games and... Woah, have you met me? If I have to go to another kegger and watch frat boys flexing in their cars, I would rather kill myself. Hey, don't say that!!! Don't get sucked in. She's just being dramatic, she'll get over it. Yeah, but maybe we should just let her go. You're always in New York for work, you can check in on her. I'm in New York enough to know that Eve's not ready for it. There's like a thousand bars in a four-block radius around NYU. Yeah, well you and I both know you only need one bar if you're gonna have a problem. She's looking a little thin. Do you think she's backsliding? I think we oughta keep an eye on it, and that'll be easier if she's closer to home. [phone vibrates] Sorry, I... I have to... [phone vibrates] Hey. Yes.

I mean, I'm trying, but all she sees is a grasping hick who grew up in a double-wide. But I will get my chance to play through with this luncheon. [light knocking] Mom? Not now, Buck. But Dad's not here, I need help with my math quiz. This is my time, Buck. Your dad will be home tomorrow. And close the door please. Thanks sweetie. Mags. Chill. It's going to be beautiful.

So, can I go to New York for the orientation party? It's this weekend, Mom. Eve, you heard what your dad said. Yeah, but I hadn't gotten in then. You really wanna go? Yes, and it's only for the weekend, and I feel like I deserve a reward after all the hard work it took. The SATs, the ACTs, and I found a cheap ticket. Okay, all right, Madame Debate Team. All right.

No, that won't be necessary. I will be in LA next week. You'll get your money. Okay. Fine. Yes. Yes. I will. Fine. Finally, come look. The party planner sent me a picture. Ho! What's the budget on this thing? My budget is whatever it takes to make Ruthie Dunbar feel like a loser, and raise money for at-risk teens. Okay, yes, both good causes. But um, do we need all this? You've been travelling constantly, I know that means a lot of sales. Nobody can resist you. Maggie? Yes? You know there's nothing I wouldn't give for you and the kids, but we need to cut back. No, not for this month. This is too important. The GGA luncheon's gonna be held at our house. I'm hosting. This is a really big first for us. Yes sir, that's right. That means you're gonna be right there beside me eating lunch. Got it? Got it. Did that taste like collagen? Eh, a little bit. [laughs] No, I'm sorry. My... my head is in my work.

Thanks for meeting on such short notice. Mark's river rafting in Yosemite. No cell service. No trouble. We've also been trying to reach him. Well, in the meantime, I'm in a little bit of a cash crunch, and I need to get some cash flow flowing. I've got to pay the housekeeper. Unfortunately, Maggie, it's not that simple. Why not? Here is where you're at. $750,000.00, that's good. I want to make a withdrawal, I'm giving a loan to a friend. Maggie, that's what you owe. Owe who? The bank. Mark extended his line of credit. Well, liquidate funds. Or the IRA, or hell, the college fund. Do whatever the hell you need to do, I need cash to get by. Mark already liquidated them. I... I... I have no assets? All I have left is the house? Actually, there is a lien on the house from the second mortgage. Are you kidding me? You knew he was in that much debt and... and you loaned him all of that money? How... All of our money? He... he said we were getting him through a shortfall. He's very convincing, you know. And now the federal authorities have blocked the accounts. What? Who's this? How could you, Dave! You're my neighbour. Maggie. Maggie. No, Maggie, wait. [exhales] I mean, I have nothing. Well, join the club. What am I gonna do? If I look at a bank statement, my vision blurs. I mean, he handled all of the finances. I have, I have a staff, I have cheques to write. I don't even... I... I don't even have bananas in the house, what am I supposed to do, rob a supermarket? This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me in my life. I mean, how can I even move if I don't have a house to sell? I've got the kids' tuition. I've got Grace going to NYU. You can always have an internet sale to sell all your things. We don't do internet sales in Greenwich. We do like, closet sales, but that's for wives who've been dumped. I could never recover from that. I mean, even if Mark came back. Well, I'm sorry, I don't understand caring so much about what people think about you. If I had anything I would hawk it in a second. I'm sorry, good luck, Maggie. Wait, Sylvie, please. Please don't go. I'm gonna need your help. What? To sell all the things that my husband bought you? Your husband? We can share, okay? If we do this right, we can make enough to cover the rest of Grace's semester, and to finish Eve's treatment. Please. Okay. I've always loved this bracelet. How much are you asking for it? That is 10,000. Wow. I was thinking more like 4. We got it for 15, I'm not going below 8. It was my push present for Buck. Mark always went big on the push presents. Well, I didn't think you'd be pricing things quite so high. You have to lower the prices if you want to unload all these things, okay? You're clinging. They know what it's worth, they want the conquest more than the stuff. They want to humiliate me. I know I used to be them... Well, whatever gets you one step closer to paying for tuition. What is he doing here? It was like pulling teeth, but I got Ruthie to come up to 6,500 if you throw in the golf clubs. You should probably take it. Why would Ruthie want my clubs? Ruthie has customized clubs. I don't know. Are you using Ruthie as a beard to buy my bracelet for yourself? Laura, are you ripping me off? I'm trying to not embarrass you any more than you already are. What is it? The FBI is looking for Mark. [whispers] For what? For fraud and embezzlement. Dave gave me this for you. It's a deed to a property in upstate New York, and it's in your name. I didn't know about a property. The keys are inside. Do you think he's hiding out up there? You can have the bracelet and the clubs, but I need to borrow your car. This is the property? Yes, this is the property. Oh, God! Be careful. Does anybody live here? I don't know. [lock clicking] Well, I can see why the bank didn't seize it. I can't even imagine Mark walking in here. He's so allergic to dust. Oh, Mark got me this painting two Christmases ago. I didn't really like it at first, I look so... Stepford. I was going to say "innocent." Look, there's files out. Maybe there's some clue on what happened to his business. Oh God, it might as well be written in Korean. Well, it was. That's where he had his manufacturing. This was a waste. [sighs] Did you cook for Mark a lot? Yeah, all the time. You? I tend to organize meals from Super Suppers. [laughs] What? No, it's just... Mark always wanted a real dinner. Does that make you the real wife, because you made the real dinners? FYI, he liked Super Suppers because it was zero points. He was dieting? He scanned every barcode. Well, maybe he just felt more comfortable with me indulging his appetite. Well, maybe he felt more comfortable with me indulging his neurotic need to be under 185 pounds. But he liked his bourbon, I'm guessing that didn't change. He didn't drink with me. I find it hard to believe that Mark could be married to somebody he couldn't drink with. I had some problems with alcohol and it was because of him or thanks to him that I found the will to quit. That's it... you don't want to hear this, it's too much information. TMI is the foundation of our relationship, so... Go ahead. My first husband died suddenly. He was hit by a car on his bike. Eve was just a baby, and... and I was a baby too, and I went from having a family to being incredibly lonely. So, I started drinking all the time. Just sipping booze out of my water bottle all day. One day I went to the beach with, uh, Eve, and my water bottle, and I passed out in the chair. And I woke up to screams and people shouting, and... Eve was being carried away by a riptide. Oh my God, that's terrible. And I was too drunk to swim out after her. I just saw her little head bobbing until she disappeared. Until this surfer dude pulled her to shore. And I will never forget the image of the most handsome guy dripping wet in his pink bathing suit with whales on them, handing me back my daughter. Mark rescued Eve. Yep. Then he saved me. I bought him those trunks with the whales. It's so good that we're... that we're airing it out, that we're processing it, you know? Because maybe this'll help us move into a new chapter. I... I like the old chapter, the one where I had a husband and was rich. Really, did you? Because you look possessed. I think I look pretty. The dog is cute. [sighs] I'm itchy in here. Could you do a pastel omelet? Pastel? What's that made out of, Easter eggs? [sighs] Never mind. Could I get a pair over easy on a raft with two logs? You got it. And for you? I'm good, thank you. What the heck is that? On toast with sausages. My mother waitressed at a place like this her whole life, so I speak diner. We're short right now, hon, if you wanna apply. No thanks. This is the fate I spent my life escaping. My mother was a miserable person. She hated her job, she hated her life, and frankly, she hated me. And I've been scared of becoming her my whole life. So Mark saved you too, huh? Yeah, I guess he did. And in return, I built him a beautiful life, gorgeous house, two great kids, and this is what I have to show for it, so. You have to go back to Greenwich with the kids. Grace is going to be at school. She doesn't, she doesn't want to talk to me anymore. And Buck, I mean, I'm sure he doesn't want to move with me into some dump. I mean, where would I take him anyway? Why didn't they take your house, too? I don't have a house. I have a rent controlled cottage in LA. What about the cabin? You could live in the cabin. You live in the cabin. I would live in the cabin. I think the cabin has a lot of potential. But I... no, I have to be in LA with Eve for her treatment. And I have enough for a few months now.

Plus, look, I don't have a bikini wax, a pedicure, a roots touch-up, or underwear that doesn't come from a big box store, all of which are required for me to have a drink with a man. Even with you. All right if I take that as a yes... Or not? [loud noise] [dog barking in the distance] [gasps] [stairs creaking] [lock clicking] [lock jiggling] [screams] Mark!!! Mark!!! I'm sorry, Sylvie, I... I'm sorry I didn't, uh... I don't have anywhere else to go. Uh... I'm in trouble. [phone ringing] Hello? [whispers] Maggie, he's here. Who? Mark. Mark? What is he doing there? He looks terrible. He looks like he hasn't taken a shower in days, he's... Sylvie, you have to call the police. [whispers] I'm terrified. I don't know if I can. Sylvie, dial 911. You cannot let him hide out in your house. If you let him stay there, you'll be an accomplice. Yeah, but if I call the police, then I'm gonna be the one responsible for putting him in prison. I will dial... I will dial 911. What is your address? Okay. Okay. 1421 Brenwick Avenue. Okay, is that Venice? Sylvie? Shit, he just bolted. Are you sure? Yeah. I am. What do you think he wanted? I don't know. Yeah, I, I've, I, I, I, I gotta go, okay? Sylvie, wait! Sylvie. You can't stay here, Mark. Why would you even come back after what you did? What, did you think that I just... would just take you in? I don't want to drag you into this, Sylvie. That's why I've been on the street. Stop it, stop it, stop it, okay?! I just, I just got off the phone with Maggie. What? Yes. We became friends After you disappeared. And I know everything. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I never meant to cause any of you all this pain. I did everything I did just so we could afford to be together. What? You lied to me. I know. You know? No, you don't know. You lied. Our entire relationship, you lied to me. No, you... you have to go. [phone ringing] Hi, this is Sylvie. Please leave a message... Something's wrong. You have a warrant against you. I could go to jail, who's going to take care of Eve? Have you ever once thought about how this is even affecting her? Just one night. And if you, if you help me get to New York, then I can arrange everything. I will take care of you and Eve. I will make everything okay. How could you possibly make it all okay after what you've done? I trusted you with my whole heart. You were my whole life. I wanted to tell you so many times... [cries] Oh, but I was in too deep. I... I married too young, I... you have to believe that I loved you. I mean you can't pretend to have this life that we've got. You can stay for one night on the couch. I hate you for what you did to us, and I hate... I hate missing you. [phone rings] [whispers] Pick up. [phone rings] Hi, this is... S'up, buttercup? Problems? No. Nothing. Could you cover for me tomorrow, do you think? Why, you got something planned? Not yet, but I'm working on it. Okay, I got your back. You owe me. Thanks. ♪ [knocking at door] Maggie? What are you doing here? Buck went to see Grace for the weekend, so I used up my old miles and took the first flight out. You know, I wanted to come and make sure you were okay, after last night. That's great... And to be here, you know, in case he comes back. You didn't have to do that, it wasn't necessary. Oh, you know what they say about rats. They follow their old trails until you plug up those holes. Nice place. It's adorable. [whispers] Sylvie, am I interrupting? Did you get some last night, sister? Maggie. This is so screwed up on so many levels. Maggie, this is not what it looks like. He slept on the couch. I knew something was off when we spoke on the phone last night. You know, I was actually worried about you. I thought maybe he was intimidating you. So I got here very early this morning, and that's when I saw him in the window. And you. Like the perfect couple. I mean, I couldn't believe it, so I just... sat there, debating. Debating what? If I should call the cops. No, you're not gonna do that, Maggie, there's not... I'm not talking to you, son of a bitch. Or did you forget who I am? I'm not Sylvie, I'm the other one, the one who'll never forgive you. Ever. What did you think I was gonna do, Mark? Did you even think about the fact that you left us with nothing? No money, no clue, no concern for any of the damage and humiliation you created? We couldn't even buy groceries. And all this time, I'm thinking, why? Why? Why would you do that? And I know why. 'Cause you didn't have the balls to look me in the face and tell me you were screwing this hemp doormat. Excuse me? Shut up! [police sirens] Oh, my God. You called the cops. Well, so much for debating. I guess you're not the only actor in the family. Mr. Hathaway. You have elected to not have representation. But you have a statement? Yes, Your Honour. I, uh, I'm not here to defend myself. I'm guilty. I'm looking for leniency from the court. I would also like the court to recognize that I have been a devoted father, and supported these two families with a full heart. I met my first wife when I was very young, and I made a terrible mistake. What are you mad at me for? You didn't even apologize. [scoffs] I have nothing to apologize for. How about for harbouring our fugitive husband, or lying to me, or... or betraying me? I didn't tell you, because I knew you would do exactly what you did. And now he's gone for I don't know how long. Does that make you happy? Yes. That's where he belongs. Well, it doesn't make me happy. That's because you're a broken person, Sylvie. That's why Mark scooped you up in the first place, because you're low hanging fruit to feed his giant ego. And you, Maggie? What... what are you? You are shallow. You are vindictive. And all you care about is revenge. He should pay for what he did. He screwed over everyone he ever met, or screwed. Because you pressured him! You needed to whitewash all that trailer park. It was never enough. I shared my money with you after you took my whole life. My husband, my house, my kids. Oh, I don't think I get the credit for that, Maggie. I think you did a pretty good job of losing your kids yourself. And your daughter ended up in that clinic because she had such a strong, supportive mother she felt that she could count on? Don't go there. Or because her mother is an emotional cripple who let her only daughter drown and used her pathetic story to steal my husband. I don't know how you can even live with yourself. [toilet flushes] Mark Hathaway, please rise. You have been found guilty of three counts of embezzlement, grand larceny, and fraud. And sentenced to two years.

Please leave a message after the... Hello? Sylvie, it's Maggie. Don't hang up. It's about Eve. She needs your help. Eve doesn't want my help. Sylvie, you sound weird. What's wrong with you? Are you okay? I'm fine, okay, I'm fine. Not that you care. Sylvie, are you drunk? Oh Jesus, this is a problem. It's not your problem. [phone rings] Hi, this is Sylvie. Please leave a message after the tone. Sylvie, if you're not gonna pick up, you need to listen to me. Eve is with Grace in New York, and she is sick. I'm heading down to the city right now, but I am not her mother. She needs you. I'm gonna keep texting you until you sober up, do you hear me? Sylvie, this is the beach all over again with Eve drowning. But this time, there is no Mark. There's just you. Mom, I called 911. I didn't know what to do, but she's not doing good. How long has she been like this? Since last night. But she just went so still, so I thought I should call. She's freezing cold. What did you guys do last night? I don't know what she did, but she was really drunk. Did she do drugs? What? No! I... Tell me the truth. I don't know what she did Mom... She's having a seizure. Oh my God... Mom! Hold her still. Hold her still! I don't... Where are these guys, did you call 911? I don't know. Yeah, they're on their way! [breathing heavily] She stopped! What do I do now? Mom, she doesn't have a pulse. Oh God, Eve! Um, uh, we have to do CPR. Remember your lifeguard training. No, but I've never really done it on a person... You can do it right now. You can do it right now, Grace, you can do it right now. Okay. Get her to the floor. Be gentle. Okay. Mom, I don't really know what I'm doing? Come on, Grace, just do it. [panicked breathing] Come on, Eve. You have to do it harder. Do it harder, Grace! Come on. Come on, Eve. Oh God. [crying] Wake up! Come on! Keep doing it. [crying] Come on! Mom, it's not working, I don't know. Don't stop this, don't stop! Keep going! Oh my God, Eve. You did it, you did it. You brought her back. Oh my God, you brought her back. You brought her back. [sirens wailing in the distance] (PA) Dr. Benson to radiology. Dr. Benson to radiology. She has bradycardia, which is a slower than normal heart rate. Essentially, her body's shutting down from dehydration. Now we're giving her fluids, but she is at risk of another cardiac arrest so... we wait and watch. [sobbing] It's gonna be okay. I'm sorry, Mom. I'm sorry about Dad. I'm sorry I blamed you. I'm sorry Grace. I am so very sorry. [both crying] I love you, Mom. I love you so much. Sylvie. I talked to the doctor in the taxi, and he said if you hadn't gotten there... You would've done the same for me. The doctor said all we can do is wait. [whispers] We've been praying. Wait. Maggie? Can you stay? [whispers] Sylvie, I'm so sorry. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But you need to know that I didn't sleep with Mark that night. When he went to prison I was hanging on by a thread. Because there's always been this void. When my husband died, I filled it with booze, and then... when I stopped drinking, I filled it with Mark. And I wasn't going to let you take that away from me. And when Eve ran away... I swear that if she makes it, that I will show her... I will show her that she's enough. That we are enough. Hey, there's something that I want to tell you. Remember that Mark left those files at the cabin about his business? Yeah. Yeah. So, I did a self-taught accounting class, and I learned how to analyze those invoices and bank statements, and you know what? What? There's money missing. What? How so? In his profit and loss statements, he claims that the company was operating in a deficit, but that's not true. A year ago, you couldn't read a credit card statement. I think Mark was making a profit. He was making all these cash payments to a Hayden Shipping. Hayden is my maiden name. Buck! How'd you get here? I... took the bus. Hi. How is she? We don't know yet. Hey, sweetie. How much profit? $3 million twenty-seven thousand give or take. What? Yes. Mrs. Hathaway. Yes? Eve's awake. You can go see her now. But she's had renal failure. She's going to need dialysis, and she's going to need it soon. Hey. Hi, baby. Where's Dad? Is he here? He's not here, but we're gonna get you better. We're going to get you on dialysis. Dad didn't show. What? She talked to Dad. When? She visited him in jail before he got out. They were supposed to meet. Where? I don't know. [weakly] The cabin. He said he'd take me on vacation at his cabin. But he's not coming, Mom. You're right. He's a liar. Shh, it's okay. You don't worry about that. You just get better, okay? I really want to get better, Mom. I know you do. I know you do. I can't afford dialysis, so if there's money, we need to find it now. I know. Right before Mark got arrested, he told me that he would take care of me when he got back from New York, so maybe... maybe that money is at the cabin. Where no feds could ever find it because the cabin was under my name. We should get out there before he does. I can't. I have to stay with Eve. I'll stay with her. I can take care of my sister. You think we beat him here? I think we did. Woah. This looks a hell of a lot better than it did before. I call it Roche Bobois meets hillbilly. I don't know where the money is. I mean, I've scrubbed every corner and cabinet of this place, and the only thing green I've seen is mold. I just, I don't think the money's here. It could be anywhere. I mean, it could be in an offshore account, if it even exists. Why would he come back here? I don't know, but if he does, we could always zip tie him to the bed and torture him until he tells us where the money is. [sighs] That's so tempting. [laughs] So tempting. I have something to tell you. I'm scared to ask. What is it? I got some. What? That hunky cook from the diner? Yeah. We had hot, unwaxed hipster sex. What? And it was spectacular. What is hipster sex? That's amazing. Don't act so surprised. I... I'm not surprised, I just, I just thought you were hung up on your old life. I mean, you won't even get rid of that creepy painting. I hate that painting too. I hate it. I mean, I look insane. Finally, you admit it. You look a million times better. Why in God's name did I even keep this painting? 'Cause you liked the old chapter where you were rich and you had a husband. [sighs] Okay, what are you doing? I am ending this chapter. [gasps] [laughs] Oh, my God! Let me try. Please, please let me try! Okay. Ahh! Get her, get her! Oh... What is it? Oh my God. What is it? Oh my God! What is that? [screaming and laughing] The money was there! Oh my God! I've never seen so much money. Look at all this money! We're loaded! We're rich! You were right! [screaming excitedly] Mark? Maggie? Sylvie? Uh, you... you live here? No house, remember? What are you doing here? Same boat. You know, I just needed somewhere to gather my thoughts, take a breath, figure out what's next. There was a painting in that room. Um, where is it? Oh, the portrait? I thought that was very sweet that you had kept it, but I... I took it down. Oh... No, I... I like it, Maggie. I still like it. Where is it? I burnt it. What? You did what? Cut the crap, Mark. We found the money. It's a little over $3 million. I think it's fair that we divide it in three ways. But then who pays for what? Are we splitting Eve's treatment? Yeah, or... College tuitions? Or are you just gonna pay for those? Shouldn't I have a say? Since I'm the one that earned the money? You? You earned it? No, you stole it, Mark. You're a thief. You take and you take. And you take. [bag rustles] Could you help me with this? Gladly. To be honest, it doesn't seem fair that I'm paying for half, out of my one third. Ooh, you should've thought of that before you decided to have two wives. What she said, because you really should be paying for all of it. You know what? Forget it. You're not getting a penny. You're lucky we didn't call your parole officer. I guess I'm a pretty lucky guy. Not so lucky. You get the couch. C'mon, c'mon. [knocking] Can't start the car without this. Oh, you lied again. [laughs] You are so predictable. You... you are. I mean, did... did you even care about Eve? Of course I do. I have every intention of paying for her... You always have the best intentions, until you do the worst imaginable thing. You send me the bill, I will pay for everything, I swear. Oh, sure. [laughs] You... you are never gonna change. Come with me. You know I love you. You are my real wife. Consider that a divorce. We're making the decisions now, and we're doling out the scraps. You can't just take all the money. This is for your ticket to who-the-hell-cares. And this, this is for your year's rent. And this is for the time you think of calling us for money or anything else. That's your going away money, forever. If you go away in the next 90 seconds. Or else what? Or else I call the cops. You're going away, and it's our decision this time.
