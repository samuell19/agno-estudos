'Debashish went off today. He won't be able to forget me ever.' 'But, no one could make out that..' '..I was pretending a smile on my face and thus, bid good bye.' 'I said with a smile on my face that..' '..I am a nurse and giving a new life to different people..' '..by lighting a lamps in their life is my duty.' Number 12. Go, go fast. Number 13. Number 14. Number 14, where is he? Do fast. Number 15. - Sister. Amar Babu.. - This time, I shall be.. Won't you go home? Wait for a little while. She is calling you. Why should I go? You go. Go fast or else, you will have to listen to her scolding. Where were you? Come soon. Number 17. Sister.. the guy is not able to eat even today. - Number 18. Who told you that he is not able to eat? I went personally and fed him. Did he have his food? Isn't he coughing? No.. no. You are being called. Me? Oh! Number nineteen.. number nineteen. Sister, this cheques had.. It got bounced, Keep it with you. Number nineteen.. number nineteen. What happened? Aren't you getting any kind of pain today? Number twenty.. number twenty.. number twenty. We have received around one fifty number of applications.. .. till now for bed number 24. After taking interviews we have seen. We have cases of General Paralysis of the insight. Paranoia, Cyzophenia, Hysteria, Manicure reactions.. ..Cause unknown. Acute mania, post epileptic.. Just hold on. You said Acute maniac. Didn't you? Well.. I am very much more interested in such cases than otherwise. As a matter of fact I would prefer to have a particular case of this type. You admit one person from such kind of cases. But, I have studied that case. Yes.. yes, I know. I know. And hence, I want to take up such a case once again. There is a special motive behind that. I want to prove that in mentally imbalance state.. ..if one can create a perfect rapport.. Just give me. Thank you. If one can create a perfect rapport in a mentally imbalance.. ..patient, then, we can avoid every other kind of treatment.. ..like operation and shock treatment. The mental fixation of a mentally imbalanced patient would become easier. We have already experienced that it works. Exactly. And, that is why I wish to take up such kind of a case again. Because who knows.. the case of Debashish.. ..was just by chance successful or so. So, if we can cure few more cases of such types.. ..then in that case, we can follow this procedure regularly as a law. Would we able to give more 4-5 beds to such cases, then? Yes. And, there is not just one Radha sister for this job. Every nurse will have to handle such cases. Did you listen? You had better asked your nurses trained that way. Whose case is the worst of all? Tapas Choudhury.. a gentleman called Tapas Choudhury. Tapas Choudhury. All right. Take him up. Tapas.. Tapas.. look, how beautifully that girl is dancing. You didn't say anything. I have already told you, Tapas. Learn to walk on sand. Be practical. Look.. I didn't come here to listen to your advices. I want to know from these many days.. If you haven't understood anything for these many days.. ..there is no use of you knowing it now also. First understand that life is not just a novel. Then, we shall discuss further. Can I know how you discovered that life is not only a novel.. ..after such a long time? Honestly, there is no use talking to you. Exactly on the front page.. news of bloodshed. If you can't understand in this way.. ..you will understand in some other manner, Tapas. Mitroda.. is this girl, a relative of Sulekha? Sulekha again. Mitroda.. I will meet this girl personally. Get up, get up that's enough. We have to leave. Get up. Tell me where shall I take you so that you will sit with a cool mind? Sit here.. sit here. Sit.. sit. Sit here. Don't go anywhere before I come back. I am going to call a taxi. Did you understand? Can you understand? Don't go anywhere before I come back. I am going to call a taxi. Sit here with a cool mind. Yes.. I will take care of everything. Listen. Who? Who are you? Whom do you want to see? Aren't you Sulekha's friend? Sulekha.. who is Sulekha? Don't you know her? Are you trying to act smart as you are her friend. This time.. I will really scream and make noise. Do make. Come on, tell me. You didn't tell me. See.. this person.. Go.. get out. Who is that? What is he saying now... He is telling that Sulekha wants to kill him. Not Sulekha.. not Sulekha. He must be thinking of Sulekha's mother-in-law. It has been already 26 days of this month we are in this lodge. Like a gentleman he can ask me, that Mitroda. What should I do I am in love, should I fall in love? Bullshit! No.. no. Everything is in a mess. Hey, Shatru.. what do I do now, tell me? I will have to go to Delhi tomorrow by the 2'o' clock train. Don't you know your sister-in-law? You don't worry about all those things. I shall manage everything, Mitroda. I will come back in ten days. Ten days? I was thinking of going to Ghashi with your sister-in-law. Her father and elder brother also stays there itself. Do one thing. If you want to admit him in the hospital meanwhile do admit him. If you want me to make any more arrangements.. ..I shall do so. I feel like.. as if I will go mad. Mad again.. what is there to become mad in it? Who is that? Who is that? We shall become mad. Come. Hello.. hello.. good morning, Mr. Choudhury. How do you feel? How did you like this place? Who are you? - Me? I have just come to see you. To see what? Why? Because, you have come to a totally new place.. ..shouldn't I see whether you are comfortable or not? What is this? Is this a hospital? Who is she? I am.. She is one of us, working here. Why do women come to my room? Why do women come? Ask her to go away. Nurse.. hasn't Radha come as yet? We have informed her. - Okay.. very good. Okay, Dr. Banerjee.. have you noticed? This case of Tapas.. seems to be.. ..it is an acute excitement of schizophrenia.. But I didn't notice any confusion in his thoughts. Come, Radha.. please come.. come. We have all been waiting for you. Here's something for you. Look and understand as to what extent we have all praised you. We are all very proud of you.. very proud. Have you seen our new patient, Tapas Choudhury? No, sir. At least, you might have definitely gone through his case history. No. This is very unlike you. I didn't expect this from you. Well, this is his case history. Whenever you have time read this well. This case is the same as Debashish. Acute mania. And, the treatment also would go on in that same line. Also, this guy writes dramas and novels. So, you will have to be extra alert. Because, such kind of people become neurotic in their behavior. But, sir. Please spare me for this time. I can't take up this case. - You can't? May I know the reason for it? I have certain problems. - Do you have problems? What problem do you have? Now, tell me.. what problem do you have? Don't you wish to work anymore? I don't wish to pretend any more. No.. no.. no. This is not acting, this is not acting. This is the way of our treatment, our treatment. It is a most essential factor of my treatment. You had cured Debashish with the same kind of treatment. And, Tapas Choudhury is in the same state. Can't you understand that if this attempt of mine also becomes successful.. ..what a big achievement it would be? This wonder has happened just because of this acting. You can do it alone. Even, I can't do it. I am.. truly, seriously in.. I see. But, the way you had shown your courage in the case of Debashish.. ..I had taken up this case trusting on you. Now, everything is solely relying on you. And, now you are saying that you can't handle it. Is this reason of yours, the truth.. ..or is there any other hurdle in your mind? Okay, you may go now. 'Debashish went off today.' 'While leaving, he said to me, 'you are my true friend.' 'I will never be able to forget you ever in my life.' 'But, no one knows that I could really act very well.' 'I have bid him good be with a smiling face.' 'I said to myself with a smiling face, I am just a nurse.' 'It is my duty to light a new lamp in the lives of those..' '..come here sick and disturbed.' May I come in, sir? - Come in. Sit. I had heard that you had watched the case of Debashish very minutely. I am very glad. I am very glad, indeed. Our new patient, Tapas Choudhury he has the same illness too. And, the treatment would be in the same line too. You already know that in the case of Debashish, Radha was a miracle. The way Radha had treated him and cured him.. ..I wish that in the same manner you also treat and cure Tapas. Me? Me? Why? Don't you trust yourself? No. That is not the issue. While behaving with this patient.. ..you must always keep in mind.. ..one thing that he has been cheated by some girl whom he loved a lot. She has given him a very big shock. She has insulted him. She has poisoned his entire mind. And, that has slowly and gradually made this kind of an impression in his mind. A tragic expression, that tragic impression.. ..that insult, that hatred with your love and affection.. ..you will have to wipe it off entirely. You will have to pretend to be such kind of a woman.. ..in whom he should see his mother or the reflection of her. His mother? - Yes. When a man in his infancy sees something new for the very first time.. ..then, he moves his hands and legs and crawl towards it on his own. And, that is called the Auto Erotic Stage. And, after that, when man looks at a face and starts smiling.. ..then, for the first time.. love is born within his heart. And, that is the love towards himself.. Self love. And, which we call as Anesthetic Stage. After that, man starts loving his mother and father. Most often, girls love their father more and boys, their mother. This is called Oedipus and Electra complex. And most of the times neurosis problem starts in this stage. Loving one's mother is a work against the society's principles. The man who is able to understand this.. ..then, he wishes to eradicate the thoughts of his mother.. ..from his sub conscious mind. But, he doesn't become successful. This results in a depression. Then, his focus is diverted to the real world. The real, material world of facts. He tries to find the behaviors and reflection of his mother in someone else. And, in the one, whom he finds all that.. ..he starts developing a feeling of liking for her. But, during this process of searching and finding love.. ..if there turns out to be any disappointments.. ..or any differences.. ..then.. he again becomes like a child and starts behaving like one. Today, Tapas Choudhury is at the same stage. Now, you will have to create such a picture of yours in front of him.. ..which would be a combination of his mother and lover as well. This is what we call as creating a perfect rapport balance. It means creating an emotional close relation. Take this, drink this. Where..? Have this juice. Who are you? Me? I am a nurse. The doctor in charge of here.. ..has sent me to take care of you. He thinks that I don't know anything. He thought that I was mad. I know that Sulekha has sent you. Tell your doctor that I won't be able to live like this. Why? Tell me, what has happened? Get me some papers. - Paper? Here is the paper. Could something be written or painted on this paper? I can understand everything. Tell Sulekha that I can understand everything. But, why are you at this hour? So then, tell me what do I do? I didn't get time. Moreover you sir called me. You'll know everything after you read this. Sister.. have you posted my letter? Okay, you may go. Not like that. Like this. Salute. Why are you in such a hurry? How many days had I given you time? In such work, nothing will happen if you are in a haste. Take this.. you may present this cheques at the bank. Did you get it? Every time, just money.. money. I just don't like this anymore. Can you give me one cigarette? Cigarette? - Yes. Do you know.. because of that mad man, not a single cigarette is spared. What is going on? What were you doing? He asked me for a cigarette. Oh! So, he asked for a cigarette and you.. Who are you? That new patient.. - Oh! A new patient. Give all the things that are there inside your pocket. Nurse.. Take all these things.. ..and see to it that he is not able to get such things inside again. Okay.. okay. Come on. There is nothing to fear. You come with me. Please sit. Why did you go down at this hour? Where did I go down? I couldn't even come up as yet. Okay.. tell me where do you have a problem? What are you seeing? - Seeing you. ..Okay, do you treat everyone as the same here? Hello.. hello. Good morning, Dipten. This is..? I mean.. my name is Mrityunjay Bandopadhyay. The senior doctor of here has sent me. Oh! Yes.. yes.. yes.. yes. Now, I remember. Good that I met you. Please sit.. sit. This Tapas Babu used to stay with you, isn't it? Oh! Yes. Now, I understood. Good that you have come. Dipten.. where are those queries regarding Tapas Babu? Here. Look Mrityunjay Babu.. - Yes, sir. There are many queries written in these papers. Please fill them up after thinking and understanding well.. ..with their answers and do return it to me. Okay, sir.. fine. These questions are very important. I understand. I wanted to ask you something? Yes, please do. What about the expenses of Tapas? You need not worry about any of Tapas' expenses. We would pay for all his expense. Because that bed is a research bed. Here.. you may now take all your belongings. What are all these? Why do you keep coming to me always? Don't come until I call you. Well.. ..what do I do if you don't call me at all? I won't call you.. I won't call you ever. Okay, don't call me. But, have your food. Will you spoil your health by not eating anything? What are you seeing? This is the knife used for just spreading butter. Let me see. What are you doing? Leave it.. leave it, Tapas Babu. Now.. what will you do now? Go. Go and tell Sulekha.. Go.. go. Get out.. Get out. Tapas Babu.. Tapas Babu. Tapas Babu. I don't want anything. I won't eat anything. Go.. go.. go. Sir, this is going out of control now. You repeat that earlier injection. But, how do we give him at this stage? You will have to.. - Who is that? Who? You will have to give him the injection. We'll have to do this. Okay, fine. Let me see. Good morning, sir. Good morning. I will have to go out this evening. I won't be able to come back before day after tomorrow evening. Tomorrow evening, at six 'o' clock.. ..Debashish will come here for his monthly check-up. You.. Would you be able to attend to this case? Yes.. yes. Yes, sir.. I shall do it. Thank you. Hello.. With me? Oh! Yes. I am going right away.. right now. 'Debashish.' Greetings! Are you.. Radha? Oh! I have come from Debashish babu. He has gone out for a few days. Hence, aunty means his mother.. ..has sent you message that there are no much complications now. He is absolutely fine. He.. has he gone out for some work? Yes.. some work regarding his business.. he has gone for that. Has he gone alone? Yes. It is a good thing. Aunty wanted to know when you are going to their house. House. I will go one day. Okay. Then, I take your leave. Bye. Bye. You see that the.. oh! Beena.. listen.. listen. How is he? How is Tapas Babu doing now? No, sir. I am not able to influence him. It's impossible. Don't say impossible. Impossible. I.. I am sorry, sir. How is his behavior? Hostile.. he has no hunger at all. Temperature? - 99. Counts? 110.. volume very weak and low. The biggest difficulty is that.. he never cools down at all. Well. You must hold on to this position. Lift your legs towards the ceiling. Now stay like this. Keep these. Sister.. shall I tell you one thing? What is it? Today, I won't let you drink at all at any cost. Why are you so stubborn about this? Sister.. are you the one, telling this. I never misbehave in inebriated state after drinking alcohol. I get inebriated and then I drink alcohol. Please sister.. give me only very little. I won't have any more. Won't you have ever after? - I won't have it ever again. Are you telling the truth? - Yes. Sure? - Yes. Hey.. here, take it. Do you remember..? You won't drink ever again..? Never again, sister. Sister, thank you.. thank you. Thank you, sister. You are very good. What happened again? Why are you laughing so much? How are you? - At last, have you come? From when I have been waiting for you. - Leave me.. leave me, I said. No.. no, I won't leave you. I won't leave you at any cost. Listen.. you write one more letter. This time, he would definitely come. "Who else could be such a good friend..?" "Just like you, Mister?" "At times she's my darling, at times she's my wife, at times she's sister." "Sister?" "Who else could be such a good friend.. just like you, Sister?" "She went away. Let her go." "A heartbroken person suffers like Devdas.." " There was a lady in his life called Parvati, mister." "Just one peg makes him forget this fact." "Who else could be such a good friend.. just like you, Mister?" "At times she's my darling, at times she's my wife, at times she's sister." "I won't love anyone as much as I love you." "These days girlfriends don't say that they love us. All they ask for is money." "Give me some money." "Treat your glass as your girlfriend and talk to as much as you want to." "It won't cost you money, O mister." "Who else could be such a good friend.. just like you, mister?" "At times she's my darling, at times she's my wife, at times she's sister." "The child cries due to lack of food. There is no end to the sufferings." "Immerse yourself in the bottle and you will forget all your sorrows." "Who else could be such a good friend?" I think that this case is complicated for our experiment. The whole difficulty is.. ..that the patient is running at the risk of death. So exhaustion. He could die. Do you know what the matter is, Dipten? If this case of ours fail.. I won't be able to establish this theory. We can see for another three four days more. After that, I feel.. that it would be better that we start some other treatment. I am afraid you are right. May be, I shall have to take records for shock therapy. Okay, how is Tapas Babu today? He is the same as he was. What is your opinion about Beena? How is she handling the case of Tapas Babu? She is trying her level best. But, it would have been better if it was Radha. What can be done? She is not ready for it in any way. That's the entire trouble. The coming Thursday is my wedding. I thought a lot whether I should write to you or not. Should I try to contact you again or not? But, there is no other option. My parents were saying that they would go to invite you too. They think that.. ..I need to take your best wishes for this. Their opinion is not wrong, but I am feeling guilty to do this. I've always taken from others, I never thought of giving anything in return. I don't know why the same thing is coming to my mind again and again. My parents wish that I go personally to inform you. But, I am scared to do this mistake. And, the reason behind it.. who knows that better than you? I feel that you will definitely come to my wedding. Radha, there was no mistake from your side. You must come. Debashish. I got your letter. Dear Debashish Babu.. your letter.. Your letter. Respected sir. I got your letter. May your new life be good. How do I come though I wish to? Please trust me.. this coming Thursday.. is quite impossible. I shall pray for your well being and happiness. Radha.. Radha Sister. Now, won't you tell me, what is the matter? After that, you will tell me.. 'God.. you are blushing so much.' After that, 'are you going to give away everything and go?' Then you will say, 'tell me, sister Radha?' And, I will just say.. The day when I'll have to give away all my savings. Let that day come. I will hold 'Sanchayita'.. ..tight to my chest and without telling a single word will fly away. Hey, Radha.. Muktan da has called you immediately. Don't you even know what a great task is writing a book like Sanchayita. Here, she is.. please come. You are going away so soon? Yes, he has some work. - Oh! Look, we cannot resist to see this girl. Debashish told me today that I gave birth to him.. ..but Radha has given him a new life. He is right. Hurry up, I'm getting late. Debashish would have said this matter to you. But, I can't just resist from saying this to you, myself. What is it, mother? The girl, for whom he cried so much.. ..our Debashish's wedding has been fixed with her itself. Wedding.. of Debashish? Yes. They no longer have the objections that they had earlier. Are you done? I won't be able to wait any more. Ok. Bye, daughter. "This night is yours and mine.." "Let it become yours and mine.." "Just the both of us.. let this song beautify this night.." "..and spread all over.. and, become an epic." "This night is yours and mine.." "You and I are on different banks.." "I want to reach out to you anyhow.." "I want to reach out to you anyhow.." "Just the both of us alone.." "This night is yours and mine.." "Let it become yours and mine.." "Just the both of us alone.." Aparna Di.. shall I ask you something? Yes, tell me. I wanted a holiday in the evening today.. for a special cause. You will go for your special work.. ..and, who will do the work of managing here? I will go only after finishing all my work. If there is any need even after that, I shall instruct Uma and go. You are doing just whatever is there in your mind now days. Then, why are you asking me about this? Do whatever you feel is right. The case of Tapas Choudhury is heading towards the worst side. Hope you might have heard about it. It seems that the guy won't survive any much further. When you had been abroad during the last time.. ..you had told me before going that.. ..your only duty would be service to mankind. There was something special in those words of yours on that day.. ..that I couldn't forget them even today. Would this fellow come to an end just like... ..this itself after having come to us? Sir.. you don't embarrass me by talking about this topic again. I never thought of telling no to any work. But.. please forgive me for today. Do you know, Radha.. during the war on those days.. The condition at the Off... field hospital was worse. No medicines.. no first aids.. ..no space also.. and, to add to the despair, no convoys too. Outside the camp, I could hear the screams of my own people. Then, I saw another man lying unconscious and badly injured. And, a nurse.. somewhat of your age only.. ..removed all the clothes of her own body and covered him. And kept lying holding him tight to her... ..self in this shivering cold night. On seeing me, she just asked, 'can you give me a blanket?' I thought what could be worse than this. The next day, he died. I went to that sister and asked her whether he was any relative of hers. 'Any relation of yours?' 'He was just one of our boys.' He was just one of us. Today also, those words echo in my ears. Since then I always believe that.. ..no one will leave this world with complaint against women. Sister.. whose duty is it at the female ward now? At the female ward.. Renu Di. Renu Di... Ask Renu di to go there and look at the condition there. Go soon. I won't spare you today. I won't leave you. What are you doing? Leave me.. leave me. Look.. what have you done? Do you like to beat some one? Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.. Not you.. not you. She was sent by Sulekha. They can't come here. I won't let anyone come here. None of them will come here. I won't let anyone come here. Sir. - Yes. What happened? Come.. come.. now. Whatever you have to say, say it fast. I don't have time. Would you.. give me the case of Tapas Babu? Radha.. Please proceed. Listen.. - Me? Is Mitro Babu there? - Mitro.. Mitro da.. Shall I go? - Yes. You? I am coming from the hospital. My name is Radha Sister. Oh! Please come.. sit.. sit. Please come.. sit.. sit. How is Tapas Babu? Good. I have come to you to enquire certain things about Tapas Babu. Well.. well, good. Please sit.. sit.. sit. Look at this. All these letters are of that girl. Look. It seems as if it is an ocean of love. Even after writing these kinds of letters, if any girl can.. Okay.. if you don't have any objection.. ..I am taking away all these letters. Yes.. yes, you may take them. What will I do with them? I used to write to my wife, copying some good words.. ..from those letters. I don't know anything. Anyway, I don't need it any more. Doesn't Tapas babu have any relatives? His parents are no more. Rest everyone is there. They are financially very good too. A very huge house. But, no one enquires about him. Tapas.. used to write poems and novels. He used to write pretty well. Their brothers didn't like it. He had a fight with his brothers regarding this matter.. ..and he just came off here taking just those letters from his properties. After that..? What else after that? Whatever was remaining that girl destroyed it all. Seeing Tapas at such a worse condition.. ..ocean of her love got dried up once and for all. She insulted him and threw him out of her house. He behaved very rudely that night. As soon as he entered, he started with the topic of that record. Record? Don't ask me.. that girl used to sing and all. If you want to sing, then do.. but... she recorded a song written by Tapas. Then, after that.. with that song.. day and night.. ..dawn and evening.. he used to just play them and tear my eardrum. Then, he used to come and whisper into my ears.. Sulekha is this.. Sulekha is that.. Sulekha is such. Now, tell me.. how is Sulekha? That.. here.. look at this. What is the condition of this record. Do you know which song was it? The song was like... no more emotions.. something like that. Ok.. tell me do you know anything about Tapas' mother? About his mother. Means.. though I have not seen her... .. he used to tell a lot about his mother, he used to like her a lot. One day he and myself, were going somewhere.. .. suddenly after seeing one lady he stood there and said .. .. see how beautiful that lady is, she is looking like my mother.. .. my mother also used to wear sari with a red border. Do you know to sing? No. So, do you mean to say, you don't know to sing? No, but I love to listen songs. Everyone loves them. But not all the songs.. ..perhaps two three songs have left.. ..an impression on my heart. One of the song I listen very regularly. I won't be able to forget that song ever in my life. 'Today, there are no more emotions.' 'My heart got lost somewhere for some reason.' 'I know that.. I won't get it back even if I try to find it.' Where have you listened to this song? Why? In one of the records. Do you know whose song is this? Yours. That is why I keep thinking looking at your face.. ..as to how you write such good songs. Did you like it? If at all I get such thoughts and good things in mind.. ..even I could write such good songs. Do you remember the words after that? After which? That one.. 'I don't know.. I don't know that..' Those words. In the far distance.. In the far distance.. In the far distance.. - "The birds call me." "The birds call me." "There was so much pain in the heart." "I am missing it so much." "There was so much pain in the heart." "I am missing it so much." "Why don't you sing that song again?" "I want to hear your melodious voice again." "I won't have any other pain.." "..if my heart gets lost somewhere without any reason.." "I don't know if I will get see you again.." "I don't want anything else." That's it. Do you know.. I have just got a plot in my mind. Plot? - Can you give me some papers and a pen? I.. I will write another novel. Would.. you write it.. really? I shall get you papers and a pen right away. If you.. Why? What happened? No..no. I can't. Why? Why can't you? I know the beginning of the story... But, I don't know the ending. Tapas Babu.. I know the end. You just start and I shall tell the ending. Wait. I will get everything. God.. ..what have you scribbled? What is this? What happened? Nothing. I can see it very clearly that there is something wrong. And, you are saying, 'nothing'. Nothing can be done with me now. Everything is over now. Is it? Who told you? 'You were about to give me all credits, but did you ever know..' '..that there are many things incomplete in me too.' 'There are a lot of things left.' Okay, now tell me.. who had written this? Myself. - Come on! I am in no way able to write anything. People who can.. are in a sorrow that they aren't able to write... In a struggle to write even better. But, how will it do if you don't write? You will have to write.. at any cost. You will have to. Or else, yourself and myself.. ..won't we look small in comparison with Sulekha? Remove your clothes and throw them. Can't you listen if I say just once? What is this? Why did you stop? I am telling you to.. remove them. Look.. what a picture, the entire women have. Don't look at me. Look somewhere else. I am telling you.. look somewhere else. Staring at me like this.. you won't be able to cheat me anymore. Why don't you understand that.. I just hate you. Not you.. but, me. Yes, I shall catch hold of you and throw you out this time. I know that Sulekha will come one day. She will have to come for sure. And, that day.. that day.. ..in this manner.. in this manner.. I will kill you. Come.. please come to have your food. Who is that..? Where is she? Who? Radha Sister. Yes.. yes. She has gone to Sulekha sister's house. "Today, there are no more emotions.." "My heart got lost somewhere for some reason." "I know that.. I won't get it back even if I try to find it." "Today, there are no more emotions.." "My heart got lost somewhere for some reason." "I know that.. I won't get it back even if I try to find it." "Today, there are no more emotions." "The black-bees will hum the music." "..in that music.. my heart will forget everything." "The black-bees will hum the music." "..in that music.. my heart will forget everything." "But, I still won't go away.. leaving your world." "Today, there are no more emotions.." "My heart got lost somewhere for some reason." "I know that.. I won't get it back even if I try to find it." "Today, there are no more emotions.." "I don't know anything." "I don't know.. I just don't know that." "I don't know when you called me last time." "Do you know how many stories arouse in my soul?" "How much did you like them?" "Do you know how many stories arouse in my soul?" "How much did you like them?" "There are some dreams in my eyes." "I won't let this moment pass by." "Today, there are no more emotions.." "My heart got lost somewhere for some reason." "I know that.. I won't get it back even if I try to find it." "Today, there are no more emotions.." You? Greetings! My name is Radha. I am a nurse. I came to meet you with regard to a special reason. No.. meet me..? Tell me.. what is it regarding? Nothing as such. I just wanted your co-operation regarding a patient. I can't get you. Do you know Tapas Choudhury? He is suffering from mental illness. He has been at our hospital for a few days now. I can't understand.. what is the meaning of telling all this to me? Means.. you can help us a lot in treating him so that he can be cured. And, you will have to do this. How is that? You will have to come with me to the hospital once. Me? - Yes. What's the reason? The reason? The reason is that Tapas Babu thinks that.. ..you had thrown him out of your house. He got frustrated because of that. If you go.. he will scream at you and abuse you, a lot. He will throw you out from there thinking that the hospital is his house. You will have to bear that and come back calmly. Today.. you will have to do this much favor. I am surprised to hear all this. Do you know at whose house are you sitting and saying all this? Yes, I know. Rai Bahadur N.C. Banerjee's house. I am forcing you to go with me.. just because I know that. Now, you may leave. And, don't dare to come here ever again. I won't come here in the future.. only if you come with me. No.. no.. no.. I won't go. Please, for heaven's sake, you go from here. Listen.. I am not asking you to do this for the sake of Tapas Babu. But, it is for your welfare itself. For my welfare? Do you know these letters? These are written by you. 'Tapas.. wherever you may go and stay.. you will always find me near you.' You have written.. 'Why do you repeatedly question me? 'Don't you know that if I don't get you, my life would become meaningless.' You have written even more. 'I am feeling scared.. I feel as if a star would fall from the sky.' 'An auspicious day.. no one would be at home in the afternoon. Come once.' Have you come here to blackmail me? I am requesting you. You come. I shall reach you back after eight hours. Who? Who is that? Who is that? Who are you? Why? Don't you recognize me? Has Sulekha sent you? No. I am Sulekha myself. Nurse.. leave me.. leave me.. leave me. What are you doing? Move.. move. I will kill her.. I will kill her. Yes.. now, just sleep. Sleep. - No.. no. Tapas babu.. Just go to sleep. Can I use the phone, please? Who is that? Hari? Yes, this is Sulekha calling. You come here soon. I am in a very big trouble. Yes.. yes I'm at the mental asylum. Please come here immediately. Get up. Who are these people? Is she that nurse? Do you know that we can hand over you to the police too? Hold this. I shall dial the number for you. Sulekha Devi couldn't trust anyone among the three of you. She has given this news of conspiracy to three people. But everyone knows people like Sulekha Devi. One man is there.. in cabin number 24.. We'll have to extend that bed very soon. If you want space over there, do give an application earlier itself. Because, we have taken the responsibility of rising him.. ..from that stage of madness to your level. Then, what more do you have to worry about? Giving some one poison and poisoning some one's mind.. ..is the same crime. You took away all the happiness of a person.. ..and threw him in that gutter. And, that we will give him. Why? Your letters. I will be grateful to you.. for having come today. Bye. Radha Di.. doctor has called you immediately. Why? - They are taking Tapas Babu for giving him shock treatment. Shock treatment for Tapas Babu? He is creating chaos over there. Impossible. - No.. no. No. Please.. stop it.. Remove this. Please save me.. please save me. I will die. I am really sorry, doctor. I shall give this responsibility to you, later Get up.. get up. Now, there is nothing to worry. Come on. Come, let's go home. Get up. Come. But, I heard that Sulekha went in a half dead state from here. Well.. our responsibility is to cure a sick person. And, I have tried to do only that. But, you can't risk a healthy person's life for that sake. Don't you have any social responsibilities? You don't have any complaint against them.. ..who are damaging the society itself. Because you are into practice. You need sick people. But we don't want that. We have some responsibilities. Our complaint is against them who spread this disease. They will spread the disease and we will have to pay for that? I am sorry. You had only said this, sir.. ..that we'll have to wipe off the image of that girl from the patient's mind. Day by day, whatever I could understand on observing Tapas Babu.. ..his desire to meet that girl. I did just what he desired. But.. I heard that you insulted Dr. Ghosh regarding the matter.. ..of giving him electric shock. He has mistook it for an insult. In your absence, there was no other option, sir. I see. But, you could have even made him understood in a softer manner. There was no time for that. Besides that, a fruit had just grown. Tapas Babu's trust on me was much more important. I can give you a word today.. ..that this experiment of yours also would be successful. I knew that, Radha.. I knew that. Now.. try to go to sleep. It is very late in the night. Or else, you will fall ill again. Good night! - Radha.. you don't go away. Great.. shouldn't I sleep? No.. no. If you go away, they will take me again. Okay. You sleep and I am here itself. 'Debashish.. hey, Debashish.' 'Shall I go now?' 'Why? You sleep like a good boy now and I shall also go and sleep.' 'No.. no, Radha.' I feel very scared. 'You don't go leaving me alone.' 'No.. no.. Debashish. I won't go leaving you alone ever after.' 'I won't go anywhere.. Debashish.' 'Debashish.' 'Debashish.' Debashish.. Deba.. How is that? Good. It has turned out to be very good indeed. Okay.. tell me what do I do with this heroine now? Should I tell you everything or what? Didn't you tell me that you will tell me the end? Oh! Had I said that? The heroine.. what is her name? Reena. - Reena. Reena.. Reena will fall in love? Will start loving. I don't want that ending. Will the union take place if you wish? What do you mean? I want to say that.. ..the lovers won't unite again. Because.. no one will come to know of her love story. What more.. not even the person whom she loved. If she loved, then.. why would he not know of it? Why wouldn't he know if she loved him? He wouldn't know that she loved him.. because.. ..Radha will never let him know any day. Radha! No..no. Reena.. Reena. You.. I shall come soon. Radha! You said it right, doctor.. you said it right. Tapas Choudhury is recovering very speedily. What? His pulse is normal and we have taken all other tests. Yes.. Radha once again. Yes. She's the real heroine. "This night is yours and mine.." "This moon is yours and mine.." "Just the both of us.." "This night is just for that song." "This song.. this will take away my life." "Just the both of us.. this night is yours and mine." Greetings. - Greetings. How come you are here at this hour? I am like this only.. I come at this time only. But.. this is not the visiting hour. But, I come at any time.. isn't your doctor there? The senior doctor..? He had told me that I can come at any time to meet Tapas. Then, what? You just need to come here once and go away. You heard it. Then it's sufficient to meet you. Bye.. bye. Here.. Pradip Keshto. Mitroda.. come.. come. Please sit. How are you? - Fine. Are you really fine? - Yes, really fine. How are you? I am fine too. You seem to have become absolutely all right. I am very glad. But, beware.. ..don't ever dare to fall into this love matter and all again. No.. no.. no. No laughing.. and all. Is that a man's job? First of all work hard and after you settle down you can marry someone. Mitroda.. someone will listen. Then, won't people listen the sound of your laughter? Someone will hear if I laugh? The way you made every one cry.. don't they know anything? I am very happy to see you like this. Okay.. let me take your leave now. Mitroda. - Who is that? Come.. come.. come. Today, as it is Saturday.. I was going home so.. ..I just thought of meeting him before I go. You have done a very good thing. Okay, Tapas.. let me take your leave. Have your medicine. What happened? Take your medicine. Are you angry or what? No. Then, why aren't you taking the medicine? My wish. - Your wish? Where were you till now? Don't I have any other patients? Okay, then.. just keep it there. Good lord! - Wait. I am telling you to keep it. You spoiled the entire mood by getting angry. I had thought of giving you good news. Not anymore. Good news..? What good news? Colonel has said that we can go out from tomorrow onwards. Really? Radha.. where shall we go out, Radha? Radha.. What happened, Radha? Radha.. tell me where shall we go? Today.. should I give the answer for that too? 'Radha.. Radha.. hey, what are you thinking about?' 'Nothing.' 'Do you know Radha.' I will never leave you. I will always be there with you. 'Debashish.. please, Debashish.. don't say that.' Tapas Babu. It is too late. Go to sleep. I don't feel like sleeping. You sit here, I'll go to sleep. I feel that.. the time I shall spend sleeping.. ..will be wasted. Even if you don't sleep your time will be wasted. Sleep now. Okay, Radha. What happened, now? Why do you talk to me addressing me as a stranger? Oh! That. I never thought of it. You never asked me to address you with your name any day. Should I have said that? Did you tell that to me? As if you don't need to be taught about anything. You are going away after a few more days. What will you do after going out from here? Tell me. Tell me. I have asked Mitroda to look out a small house for me. And, my solicitor has made all the arrangements regarding the.. ..partition of the property also. I can see that you have grown quite intelligent. Won't I become? It is said that the goddess of wealth should be handled carefully. Tell me something. Tell something. Will you listen to what I say? Of course, I will. Tell me. Go to sleep. Okay. Good night, Radha. Good night. I want to see you tomorrow morning. Yes! Radha.. come.. come, my dear.. come.. come. I was just thinking of calling you. Look.. what a news is lying here? A telegram.. he has mentioned your name specially.. What happened? You seem to be too much exhausted. Nothing. No.. no.. no. You are looking definitely tired. Your mind also seems to be tired. Do one thing. You take a leave of few days and go for an outing somewhere. Go wherever you feel like going. Just inform wherever you would like to go. I will make the required arrangements. You go. I had a request, sir. Request? You just give me the order. Tell me, what do you want? Tapas babu.. would be discharged within two three days itself, isn't it? I don't want to meet him. Not even before he leaves. If anyone else would have said this, I would have asked why. But, I won't ask you that question. It is fine. Now, I shall give the finishing touch myself and.. ..take all the credit for myself. What do you say? God Bless her! No.. no.. I am telling you not to clean my room. Why isn't Radha coming here? Go, find out and come. Go. Nurse, can you tell me where Radha sister has gone? She has gone out. Colonel has sent her out. Colonel has sent her out? Radha went away without informing me. Are you sure? - Why not? We.. Where is Colonel? - Who is that? Oh! Tapas Babu.. come on.. come on. You are looking very healthy.. in the pink of health. Thank you. - I am very glad to see. What else? Hope you don't have any inconvenience. You are hundred percent fit? - Absolutely, sir. That is very good news, indeed. Excuse me. Okay.. am I going tomorrow itself? Yes. Why? Where is Radha? I have not been seeing her from a few days. She has gone on a special mission. Okay.. it is none of my concern. I was here for these many days. She has some important work. She may come after 8-10 days. Ok. I'm in no hurry. I was here for a long time. It's a matter of just 8-10 days. Besides that, I liked this place a lot. Then, I take your leave. Listen. I had thought that I won't tell this matter to you. But, I now feel that I should tell you. Radha is here itself. She hasn't gone anywhere. But, due to some special reason.. ..she doesn't wish to meet you anymore. Radha is here itself. And, she doesn't wish to meet me? No. Tapas Babu.. I certainly owe you, an explanation. Whatever relation you had with Radha till now.. ..that was just an important part of our treatment. And, thank god.. through this medium, you have become fit too. You might have mistaken it as love. And, I wanted the same too. But, this wasn't love. That was.. in our language.. play acting. Just acting. Acting? Impossible. If it was impossible, then, you wouldn't have been recovered today. But, she was just acting with me.. ..I can't believe this. You just call her once. I want to hear once from her itself that it was all acting. Let her say that looking into my eyes. That is not possible, Tapas Babu. You are sad hearing about this matter of play acting. I can understand that. But, you will forget that sorrow just after two days itself. But, the service mentality of the girls here.. ..the discipline and concentration.. ..will certainly remain in your mind. If you go and meet her now, she will get disturbed. Whatever favor she has done to you.. ..that was certainly not a sin. Where is Radha? Definitely, at her home. Stop him. Don't allow him. Tapas Babu.. Tapas Babu. Tapas Babu.. Tapas Babu. Radha.. Radha.. open the door.. just once. You look at me once and say that you were acting with me for so many days. Radha.. Radha.. I won't be able to forget you forever in my life. Radha.. look at my face and tell me just once. Radha.. I promise you.. that I won't disappoint you any day. Tapas babu.. Radha.. at least, let me meet you once before I leave. Radha.. meet me, Radha. I promise you that I won't leave you. Radha, listen.. Radha. I won't disappoint you. Dipten.. how did I do such a big mistake? For these many days.. I treated Radha just as a Nurse. I didn't see the girl in her.. not even once. Twenty two.. Number.. Twenty three. Number. Radha! You trust me.. I.. I wasn't just really acting. I.. I was never acting.. even for a single day. I.. I can't do acting.. Just can't act.. just can't act. Radha! Radha! Radha! Radha! Radha! Radha!
