Long ago, when the past was the present, the human world and the magical realm of the Enchantsphere existed side by side. Until, one dark day, a ferocious dragon came from the Enchantress to destroy the human world and all mankind. With one blow, Cyril dropped the dragon. But he didn't completely win. For his spirit fled from his body into the Enchantsphere. There, he plotted revenge. The dragon learned about the Fire Flower. With this mystical flower, he could regain his skin and destroy humanity. Eventually, the dragon was forgotten and the city was reborn. However, Adler knew that the evil was not over, he just bided his time. NICKY AND THE DRAGON SPELL Subpack by DanDee Nicky! Nicky! Bogdan arrived. Open the gate. Nicky, if you're not down in 30 seconds, I'll give all the pies to your brother. Good morning, pie. I mean, mother. Good morning my love. Here. Take the pie. I love you mom! I love you, Draco, more even than pies. Good morning Dad! There are bears that hibernate less than you. Open the gate soon, Nicky. I'll have turned old by the time we get inside. Hey! Stop there! Who are you calling old? That's not what I meant, dad. I still beat you playing keg. He is sure? Look, Draco. I'm still going to be barrel game champion one day. Bring water to your father, Bogdan. I carry. Nicky got it. I'm on my way. Look at the weightlifter. Show the muscle, Nicky. Hey! Only I can make fun of my brother! Thank you, Nicky! Colder than a penguin's butt, just the way I like it. Hang on. Come with me, son. I want to show you something. Can I kill a dragon? The dragon skin might be impressive, Nicky, but it's not as special as this one. Show a dragon with skin so soft. Yes, cows are much more exotic than dragons. Nicky, I may have slain a dragon, but it's nothing compared to the thrill of enjoying my first skin. You'll still be a big tanner, you'll see. Imagine the adventures that await you. Adventures tanning furs. Imagine. What do you think? -I have a question. -Say. When a dragon breathes fire, why doesn't it get burned? Here we go... Fireproof skin, right? But what about inhaling smoke? I need to know that if I ever have to face one. If that happens, I'll bet on Nicky. The dragon will die laughing when he sees it. Yes, if the smell of his sweat doesn't kill him first. Come on, your mother is waiting. We meet again, dragon. Why do your knees shake? Don't be afraid of me, be terrified! For I am the great and mighty Nicky Tanner. The beautiful and famous dragon slayer! And I came for one reason: justice. To escape? There is no way to. Only death! So you still know how to fight? What are you waiting for? En garde! The dragon skin! Nicky, what happened? It was not me. No? So it was Draco? You need to get over this obsession with dragons. They went extinct. I killed the last one. And do you know why? Because you are a hero! I'm not a hero. I'm a Tanner. Like you. I just wanted to defend our way of life, so that one day my children can take over the family business and... But I don't want to tan leather. I want to be a hero, like you. I wish I were bigger. Son, listen to me. Size has nothing to do with greatness. Strength comes from the heart, not the muscles. I hope one day you understand that. I'm sorry, Draco. ...and that's why you should never mix fire spells with gunpowder spells. I learned this the hard way. I remembered something. Finished the lesson, Eddie? But of course, master. Yesterday, I mastered the levitation spell. Really dominated? So it should be easy to levitate Hilda. No problem. Let's go. One two three four. Voarviarium! You know I said "levitate", not "turn into a crazy freak of nature", right? Yes of course. Don't worry, everything is going according to plan. She will fly, as she will see. I just need to give you wings. Stop it, Eddie. She still gives eggnog after her last experience. You complain now, but wait until Christmas. I had to teach you to speak, didn't I? I could have a deep conversation with my armchair right now, but, no, I had to waste that talking spell on you. I saw it! For I see in four magical dimensions. I hear in six and taste in 12. But is that... You need to learn good manners. Can go. Read the 72 scrolls on the topic by tomorrow... Sorry. A red comet! What is it, master? We have no time to lose. Before an ancient evil awakens and plunges the world into a maelstrom of unending horrors. Horrors? Good time to take a vacation. Go to the beach, flirt with the mermaids. You would wear a hat. Bald heads burn easily. We need the help of the mighty warrior, Cyril Tanner. Immediately take this letter to Cyril Tanner. Did you kill the dragon? What a brave boy. Sorry, dad. I was kidding. It was a rip of nothing. You are welcome? It took me two hours to fix it. And now you can barely hold the needle. True. I pricked my fingers. That's why Nicky needs to learn the trade. It's time. But I do not want. Nicky, you need to... Adler wants to see me. It must be serious. Adler the sorcerer? I will go together. No! You stay here. Take Nicky and have Adler turn him into a frog or a tadpole. Dad, can I come along? I already said no. Behave yourself while you're away. I'm serious. Take care my love. Take pies to Adler. What if Daddy has to fight someone? Maybe I can help you. At least a little. You? Help you out? I know I can! Nicky, come back here. Daddy will be angry. Draco! Draco, you can let him go. He won't leave here. I will follow him, whatever the cost. We have to find out what Adler is going to say to Dad. Come on, Draco. I need your help, Cyril. Our world is in grave danger. Draco, sitting. It is a very serious fact, my friend. Did you notice the red comet in the sky? And how not to see? It's a sign. That the Fireblossom fern will bloom in the Enchantsphere. AND? The Fire Flower's magic is very powerful. We have to find her as soon as possible. We'll start at the Lago de Cristal house. Didn't you know it's ugly to spy? A talking bat? It is not so difficult. Even you can. Hey. Disgusting! Keep that language to yourself. He likes you. And who doesn't? Behold Eddie the Magnificent! I am a master of white magic. And Adler's right-hand bat. Is he a wizard too? Not oficially. I haven't finished some courses yet. But I am a celebrated magician. You can call me Your Magic. My name is... Nicky. And this is your friend Draco. I know everything. Then say. Does the Enchantsphere really exist? Does she have a Fire Flower? What happens when it blooms? It's because... No more questions. It's top secret information. Beauty, no need to tell. I really didn't want to know. He is alive? But I killed him! Unfortunately, the dragon's spirit has possessed Siringa the witch. Can we expel the dragon spirit from Siringa? When the Fire Flower blooms, the dragon's spirit will break free from it. Great. It is not good. If the spirit takes hold of the Fire Flower and its skin, he will become a dragon again. Why don't these annoying dragons stay dead? Magical realms have their downsides, my friend. The red comet. The Fire Flower will bloom! I'll have my dragon skin! And my freedom! This bag of flesh and bones! Why can't I spit fire? You want to know, don't you? -Not a lot. -Yes, they do. I know. No. Stop ignoring me guys. He is well. You win. That's the deal. The Flower of Fire is magic. Can she fulfill any wish? Can it make me very strong? No, I'm sorry. Then I will never be a hero like my father. But do you know what the sorcerer Adler would say? "The strength of the spirit surpasses that of the fists". Serious? No. Is playing? Do you really think Cyril would have defeated the dragon if he had been small and weak? Dragons are merciless. Believe me, I know. I had three wings. What else do you know about them? They are terrible dancers. And they need the skins to be dragons. Like the one hanging in my father's workshop? Exactly! The dragon can only go back to being who he was when he has the skin. Then, the power of the Fire Flower will restore your life. And what happens? After that, the only way to destroy it it is turning it to ash with its own flaming breath. I want to slay the dragon once and for all! How do we get to the Enchantsphere? Through the magic portal. But only powerful mages like me can open it. Although, as I said, I'm not technically a mage. But I'm going to do some catching up on wand use in the summer... I can prove my powers! Portalius faris boom ba da boom! The goat is smart. All right, nice trick. Can you close that section? Admit that I am an all-powerful wizard. You are a wizard... Say. ...almighty! You can close it! Sure, no problem. How is it? Oh yes. Tera pyre! No. Tera pyre. Is it two pyres or one? Eddie! I will find a way! Pyre third pyre. No. Sounds like a soup. Minestrone! borscht! No! Bean soup! Eddie! Do something! It's hard to remember when you're yelled at. Relax. Sing something. Yeah, let's sing. Row your boat Smoothly down the river How about singing along? row your boat -Father! -Nicky! -Adler! -Eddie! What is happening? They're being sucked into the Enchantsphere! I said it was magic! Not for long! All good? I think so. They are trapped in the Enchantsphere. Don't worry my friend, we'll get them back. My son! I said I could. Never doubt Eddie the Magnificent! Open the portal. Open. Yes No problems. I will open. Look! The comet! The Dragon! What about my father and Adler? What do they have? They are there and we are here. You want to slay a dragon, I want to be a famous wizard. It's not a problem, it's an opportunity! -You're not able to open the portal, are you? -No. But everything is fine. Fame awaits. What choice do I have? Let's find Crystal Lake. That's where Dad and Adler were going. Who are these two? What? A boy and a bat? Adler! I feel his magic in that flying mouse! It's not a coincidence. What is Adler up to? Did you send a boy and a bat to find the Flower of Fire? Has he gone crazy? Find them both, Goon. Bring them to me. We need to talk. Also, roasted bat is one of my favorite snacks. I'll swallow the bat and Adler's magic in one bite. I keep thinking about my mother. She must be very worried. Think how proud she will be when she returns as a hero. Paradus! Counterattack! Eddie! That hurts! Deliver the food... or you will suffer the consequences. They are crazy? You'll see they're just hungry. And why are they throwing the food? We get sick of nuts. Deliver the bread and fruit or you'll see! See what? AND! What? Show them, Kami! -It's a squirrel. - Save yourself who can. It got in my pants! You're scratching your knees! Don't bite there! Help! Get that squirrel away from me! Wow. He is good. She. Kamikaze is the best. She is my teacher. Please I beg you. Tell the squirrel to stop. We don't have food. Why didn't you just say so? Goodbye! Wait! We need to know... I don't know what you're going to do, but you need to know something. The squirrel's friend looks like a wizard. Very handy. Almost as much as Adler. They live here. The place is called Encantesphere. No wonder he looks like a mage. Also, he can help us. Do you know the way to Lago de Cristal? Clear. How much is it worth to you? I'll take care of it. How much is it worth to us? How much is it worth to you? How about food? Oranges the size of houses. Loaves so big and soft you could sleep in them. Sweet strawberries the size of a cat's head. Ice cream, my dear, no nuts. Closed! Let's go! Cyril! Return to the farm. Bring all the wood and iron you have. I know how to get to the Enchantsphere. Finally! God knows what horrors Nicky is living. He can bet. How do you know if you'll pay us when we get to the lake? In addition, the journey is long and complicated. You whistle and giant, speedy snails appear? Say what? Animals like me. As well as plants and insects. I'm a lovely person. I did not say? Magic! Let's take a snail ride, Eddie. By the way, I'm Nicky and he's Eddie. Do you have a name? Mine is Rocky. The squirrel is called Kamikaze. Try to follow me. Over there! Hey, wait for me! We go down here. Isn't it a little high? Don't be a little baby. I wanted my family to see this. Isn't your family Eddie? Eddie? No! There's my mother, my father and my older brother. And I have a pet calf named Draco. You do not have family? I must have had some one day, right? A mother, for sure, but I only remember Kami. Who needs a family when you live here? -You walk like a snail. -Yes, and dragonfly. -It's free. -And he gets along with squirrels. Very cool, in my opinion. My family would never let me have fun like that. -Serious? -Serious. Who wouldn't want to live like that? It's Goon! Run away! Goon? Run! I hate this place. It is getting worse. She wants you alive. They didn't say anything about being awake. I can't even look. Nice hit. Let's finish him off. It's scratching. -Eddie! Do something! -You bet. -Rocky! -Kami! It's gonna be awesome! At the end of the cliff is a path. It leads to Crystal Lake. We meet there! Eddie, you saved them. And I think Kami likes you. Yes, my magic worked. The right way, for a change. Do you really think she likes me? Clear. Female squirrels love powerful mages. He let two kids and two little rodents beat him? You are good for nothing! I know where they're going. Where? Say it now! To Crystal Lake. Crystal Lake. The House. Now I know that Adler sent the boy. Who else besides Adler knows the house? Come, my servants, my shadows, my evil offspring. Find the boy. Discover his thoughts. Make your soul dark like a dungeon and the heart, cold as a stone. I've never felt a colder wind. How are you, Kami? To work. We have few time. That's why I love her. What it lacks in strength, it makes up for in determination. There is more magic in this world than my spells, Cyril. I wish Dad and Adler had seen us fighting. Yes. My invention of the "boom" will forever be remembered as the beginning of the Eddie legend. Eddie, should I be concerned? Perhaps. This is not normal. Nicky... Eddie... -Nicky. -Mother? Teacher? Why are you here? Adler? I should know. You caused me so much pain. Why do you leave me? I did not want. I will come back. I have to find the Fire Flower and stop the dragon. You screwed up, Eddie. He is a weak and braggart mage. I know, master. Great. Let's drown them in guilt, make them suffer. How can you destroy a dragon? A pathetic weakling like you? What? Is he Cyril Tanner's son? The man who took my skin! I'll take his son! You cannot defeat the dragon. The world will end and it will be your fault. I wasted my time and my knowledge on you. You are no longer my student. But I can defeat the dragon. I feel it deep in my heart. Heart? What a silly son I have. What's the use of having a heart without strength? My father would never say that! You are not my father! The boy unmasked us. Eddie! They are not real! What? They are real, yes. Real black magic. I can't hurt them. Can you do something, Eddie? I don't know. Some spell. It's hard to think. The boy is ours. AND? Want to bet, sir? Let's light up! No! The light! No! I bet they got lost. They're new here and don't seem very smart... What was this? You fools! It's not possible. Who are you? Can see me? Of course. It's right there in the water. I know you? It seems so. One moment, child. I'll be right back. Can you see it? Can you hear it? It elicited a strange feeling. As if he loved and hated her at the same time. Eddie! You did it! We did it, Nicky. You exposed them, I sent them running. We make a nice team, huh, Eddie? And do we have a choice? Is it the urchin and the squirrel you saw with Tanner's son and Adler's bat? Yes! Thank you, Goon. It can be a very good thing. Hello my dear. It's true that you know me. I'm your fairy godmother and I've come to grant you a wish. Anything you want. Food. Shelter. Power. Whatever your heart desires. Can you give me a family like Nicky's? A mother? It is clear. Everything you want. But for the magic to work, you need to give me something. What? The boy and the bat. Why? How dare you question me? Do you want a family or not? You just want to hurt Nicky! The kid has magic. And it's powerful. Whoever he is, we have to be careful. I want you to follow them. Don't do anything until I say so. You will need this at the right time. Rocky! Kami! Let's not talk about the woman in the lake. I don't want to scare Nicky. You won't believe what happened to us. I bet we will. It doesn't matter. You arrived. Where's the food? Not over yet. The deal is when we're done. Don't try to outsmart us. Hey, let Eddie handle this. The deal is for when we're done, but how about a snack now? Make snacks! We don't eat stone. What is the problem? One minute I'm perfect, then... a rock? We are on a mission. We have to get to the house on that island. Help us and I promise you will never go hungry again. I swear on my family. He is well. We believe in you. Excellent! First, we need a boat. It is not necessary. It saw? I am right. He has magic. If you take us to the island... I said animals like me. Let's go. It's at the end of the path. Adler said the parchment would be there. Parchment? Home? What's going on here? Going to rob a house? Why didn't you tell us about the dragon? We didn't know if we could trust you. I thought! It's locked. Back off, people. I'll take care of it. Enjoy my magnificence! This doesn't always end well. It's better to stay behind me. Abrus portus! Did not work. I hate when I grow horns. Sounds familiar. Why? I've never been here. You can put houses on the list of things that like you. All right, let's not waste time. We have to find the parchment. Where do we start? I'm going to start with this mound. Very good. This stack is mine. Do you want me to get them? Not yet. Let them do the work for us. Why is this all so familiar? Whose room is this? Whose crib is this? Where are the baby and mother? What happened to them? Why is the cradle upside down? No. Nothing here. It's a growth spell. I always wanted to be taller. I think I did. See. I don't know that language. Can you read, Eddie? No idea, but he must be older than Adler. Maybe you can read it. Rocky opened the door and found the parchment. Perhaps this is all for him. "Don't forget the bird that watches its twin endlessly, the guardian of the path of knowledge". That's weird. What are you talking about? A bird looking at its twin? I hate magic riddles. Why don't they just say what they mean? I think I understand, Eddie. Let's go. We passed him on our way here. It's a stone stork, Nicky, but I don't see a twin. Look down. The pond reflects. "The guardian of the path of knowledge". All whole? Yes, we are all fine. Got crazy? Nobody is fine. This is a death trap. The air is bad and there are poisonous bugs hiding everywhere. There's something wrong. Yes, you. No! My magic is gone! It saw? I knew! The air here is poisonous! Since we're in the Enchantsphere, it's a magical poison. The cave should reduce the spell's effect. So let's get out of here. Where does the tunnel end? I think they don't like noise. Run! It blinded my sonar! -And now? -Let's jump! Hey! What are you doing? There's no time to argue. Can you let me know next time? "Hey Roxanna, I'm going to throw you down the abyss!" "Roxanna"? What it was? What are they looking at. -You are a girl? -You are a girl? Of course I am. What got into you? But why is it called Rocky? Because it's short for Roxanna. Tune in, people. Her head caught fire. Stop! Let's turn! What's the fun? I've been wearing this hat forever. I adore it! He is well. Keep it. We'll only laugh when you're not looking. Let's cross. I'll go first, don't push. My hat! There's a bigger problem. How are we going to get up there? You quickly forget that you are in the presence of a Sorcerer Supreme. Levantus... How about flying over there and dropping the roots for us? I also liked this idea. Clear. Why not? Cut the cheap of everything. Why are you looking at me? -You are beautiful. -What? Look at the head! Could a magic flower really grow here? Don't be fooled by the word "flower". If there's one thing I've learned, it's that great magical power isn't always pretty. Eddie is an example of that. Nice. You run. I'll distract you. We won't leave you here. Yes Nicky. Bad idea. Are you distracted by a mosquito? No more than that for that stone monstrosity! We will stay together no matter what happens. -I agree with him... She. Sorry. -Find it. Hey rocky! I'm right here! Hey! You smashed a big rock! Was he not your relative? I hope he doesn't chew me up. I'd rather be swallowed whole. Hey, you are very brave. What? It's brave for a pet. And you don't eat brave animals? It depends on what I want to eat. Who are you? The keeper of the cave and other things. I don't usually go out. Life on the surface is so noisy and busy. And there's talk and rabbits. Also, I have back pain. It's cozy down here. Put it down right now! What are you doing here, brave little animals? We are looking for the magical Fire Flower. I just don't want to throw up. Not fainting. Not both. The red comet has appeared, Mr. Stone Monster Guardian. And there's a hideous dragon who wants to use the Fire Flower to destroy the human world. You take a 90 year nap and all this happens at once? Will you help us? I understand that they are valuable. I don't know where to find the Flower of Fire, but I have a little friend smarter than I am for that sort of thing. This is Firefly. He will lead you to the Flower of Fire. Thank you very much. But we are trapped in the Cave of Horrors! How do we get back there? Use this shortcut. Good luck, my brave pets. I think I'm going to take a nap. Short. Maybe only ten years. Get ready, Goon. Our time is coming. The firefly is ready to fly! It's Goon! He got me! Put her down! If not what? Listen me! Nice to meet the son of the man who stole my skin! You got me, you can let her go! Oh, it's not that simple. You want something I desire and you go get it for me. Bring the Flower of Fire and I'll give you the girl. Don't try to deceive me. I'll know when I have the flower. Adler's bat knows where to find me. My name is Eddie! The inventor of the boom! I made a mistake. We both failed, Eddie. My father could have saved Roxanna. I shouldn't be here. Me neither. I'm a crack witch. Adler was right. We have to find the Fire Flower. And do what? Give her to the dragon? It would be the end of us! It would all be over! It's over! Roxanna has only us. We got her into this mess. It's us or nothing. We're together, Nicky. Wonder! The guest of honor has arrived. Honestly, I don't know why humans create these things. Get out of here! Goon! Grab that worm! Got you now! Great. Looks like the Goon finally got one in. Nicky? Kami? You! The woman of the lake! Where are my friends? I didn't do anything with them. Nor will it ever! You won't leave until I... You! Is it my mother? Never! Make no mistake, little girl, the body may be hers, but I'm not her mother! Nicky's dragon! Yes. Goon! Stop kidding! Watch the girl! I may not be able to touch you, but nothing will stop Goon. We take off! I pray it's not too late. Nicky is smart, Maria, and has the heart of a hero. Hold on! Let's cross! I hide, pretend to be a cat, and when Syringa appears, you attack. No, hold on. It sucks. And the Goon? I made a new plan. I meow like a cat and, when Siringa and Goon look, you attack. Are you listening to me? Can you hear me a little bit? We need a plan here! I'm trying, but plans are with you, not me. No matter how you look at it, I don't know how to win, Eddie. I give her the Flower of Fire, Roxanna is freed and the dragon destroys everything. I'll take the flower and Roxanna... Let's come up with something. You are very smart, Nicky. Stopped the spirits of the shadows. She killed the stork riddle. We depend on his brain. Look at me. I don't even know if my magic will work. This is easy. It works when you use it to help someone other than yourself. You're right! Did you understand what I said? You have a genius brain! My father always says that he is more important than strength. I hope he's right... We're only going to have one chance. It's all or nothing. He took. What is happening? Nicky picked the Fire Flower. Its power is affecting all magic in the realm! Adler's spell has been broken! I am free! Free to do what I want! -Bring the witch's daughter! -As you wish. "As you wish". I enjoyed hearing that. And speaking of my most sincere wishes, our little heroes are almost here. We arrived! But maybe it's too late. The Flower of Fire has already been harvested. I should have destroyed the dragonhide instead of stitching it up. We can only hope the dragon doesn't have the flower. This way! We are almost there! Already have a plan? None? A notion? The notion of an idea for a plan? Come on, Nicky! We need to decide before we get to the dragon! Don't worry. I know what to do. -Do you have a plan? -Yes! That's good, kid. I know you have the flower. Deliver now! Can count. What is the plan? I give her the flower. That! Great plan! Give the flower... What? No! Bad plan! We cannot return the hide to the evil dragon! Got crazy? Perhaps. The flower! Now! Free Roxanna first. Release the girl. Don't give the flower to the dragon, Nicky. This will not happen! Boom! No! The dragon has my mother's body. Deplorable creatures. Trapped by their love and family. And none of that matters now! Release me from this mortal body! Mother! Roxanna! My angel! I went back! Poor naive humans. They didn't believe me, did they? Don't worry, you should consider yourself lucky. Few experience the heat of a dragon's flame! -Nicky! -Mother! Father! So much concern, Nicky. No more adventures for at least a week. Teacher! I went back! You should never have left if you had any sense. How kind of you all to gather in the same place. It's easier to fry them. Try it. I really want to skin your ugly skin again! And this time, you won't come back! Well, if it isn't my old friends Adler and Cyril. As aggressive as ever, I see. Rocky! Come help me. Nicky! What are you up to? I'll enjoy it while it burns. Wait. Thinking better... You are not worth even a spark of my dragon flame. There's no time to explain. Trust in me. No, this calls for a good old stomp! No! It can hit the kids! The dragon is getting closer! Since we are going to die anyway, no use waiting for lunch. Hold on to something. It's the first time I've piloted this. Dragon behind! To the left! Maybe on the right? He's on our tail! Let's slow down. - Let's what? - Let's what? Throw the barrels! -That! -Nailed it! We achieved! Let's count to three. Three! Nicky! Nicky! Hold on, let's think of something! Think faster! Eddie! I can't hold back! Eddie! Think, Eddie, think! What was it like? Voarius? Voarium? Flying? Nicky! Voani! It was voanian. All right, Eddie. You know how to save at short notice. So it is. Crowd? Nicky, what are you doing? What is the plan? You have a plan, right? Say yes. I played with you too much. Get ready to fry! Spit your best fire, dragon! My neck! What did you do to my neck? What can I say? My father was never good at sewing. You're going to pay for this, Nicky Tanner! Go pay! All good? Yes! That's flat! Wow! It was great, Nicky. You did it. That's how you say it... Nicky, you... I'm fine, mom. We don't need to worry about anything else. Your son is a hero. The greatest hero I know. Things worked out, didn't they, master? Don't call me that anymore, Eddie. What? Why? What are you saying? Did I do something wrong? Are you firing me? No. Take it easy, Eddie. I only said that I am no longer your master. He's a mage now. I? Mage? But wait there. I can still live in your house, right? My stuff is there... The time has come to say goodbye. We have to go back to the human world. They're coming to visit us, right? Of course yes. Let's borrow Adler's boat. He does not care. Come on Nicky! Let's be late for dinner! Come back soon, Nicky. You will always be welcome here. You're at the helm, Nicky. Mother? Don't worry honey, it's just the Goon. He's as friendly as he is scary. Finally, we can start over. Where do we start? We make a great team. With your head and my magic, no one can stop us! As long as you don't cast a "halt" spell carelessly. Hey, it only happened once. Can I open the portal? I've trained enough. Portalius faris boom, bada... No, wait a minute, that's not it. Can you wait a bit? Wants to know? Come to think of it, Adler, why don't you take care of it? I'm tired of so much adventure. Adler? Teacher! Nicky! Get back here!
