[dramatic music] - [Narrator] Darcy Weir is an independent researcher and filmmaker who has traveled around the world to study the UFO phenomenon. - [Commentator] And with a grin and a salute, before his flight, Major Cooper, along with other Air Force astronauts and space pilots, attended a traditional Air Force dining in at the Officers Club at Patrick Air Force Base, Florida. Secretary of the Air Force, Eugene M. Zuckert, stated the need for our efforts in space. - [Eugene] We believe that space can be free to all with peaceful activity only if somebody keeps it free. We are that somebody. [crowd applauding] - [Narrator] What if there was a Sinister threat lurking among the stars? A malevolent extraterrestrial intelligence daring to invade our atmosphere without consent, poised to completely change our existence by revealing themselves to the public. Could their motives be to exploit our world or have we already doomed ourselves with our own greed? Is the United States defense intelligence aware of these possibilities and do they hold the answers to these mind-boggling inquiries? NASA and various National Defense agencies in the United States have been aware of unidentified flying objects, UFOs for many decades. With the terminology used to classify them evolving over time. Since the late 1970s the US Air Force and NASA have employed different code names to refer to UFOs. One such codename Fastwalker was used by the North American Air Defense Command, NORAD, to designate UFO sightings entering earth's atmosphere from outer space. [suspenseful music] The NORAD facility which previously was located within Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado tracked numerous such bogeys, annually. [suspenseful music] [lively music] - [Astronaut] Houston, everybody around here has looked at the bird and it looks real good. - Roger, roger. - On May 14th 1973 a Saturn INT-21 launch vehicle blasted off from Cape Kennedy, carrying NASA's first space station into orbit above earth. [lively music] Skylab was a 100-ton orbital research and observation platform consisting of an air lock module, docking adapter, orbital workshop, and a solar and terrestrial telescopic advisory called the Apollo telescope mount. Orbiting the earth at an altitude of 440 kilometers, Skylab provided 10,000 cubic feet of habitable living space pressurized to 5 PSI allowing three-man flight crews to conduct NASA's first real in-depth studies into the effects of long duration spaceflight on the human body. [lively music] In addition to microgravity biomedical research, Skylab also served as an orbital observation platform allowing the astronauts to conduct a variety of exo-atmospheric solar studies and Earth Science/resources surveillance operations. [lively music] During 1973 three separate NASA flight crews rode the Saturn 1B booster into orbit rendezvousing with Skylab and occupying the space station for a total of 171 days. [lively music] [lively music continues] On July 28th, 1973, Mission Commander Alan Bean, pilot Jack Lousma, and science pilot Owen Garriott, began their Skylab 3 SLM-2 mission becoming the second flight crew to live and work aboard the space station. During their 59 days in space, Bean, Lousma, and Garriott orbited the earth 858 times, conducting a variety of experiments and using Skylab's wide array of instruments and cameras to study our sun and earth in ways not possible before. [lively music] [lively music continues] At approximately 16:35 GMT on mission day 55 the Skylab crew congregated in the wardroom to eat their lunch and discuss a procedures review of the day's flight plan. [lively music] The lunch break also afforded the astronauts the opportunity to gaze out the wardroom window, which was the largest viewing port in the Skylab station. As Skylab's orbital track was passing over the continent of Africa. Jack Lousma known as a bright red object outside the window, visible well above the earth's horizon. For over 10 minutes the crew observed and photographed this bright red UFO. Noting that it's light intensity was oscillating between bright and dim in 10 second intervals. [lively music] Finally at 16:46 GMT as their orbit was passing near Madagascar, both Skylab and the UFO cross the sunset Terminator into darkness and visual contact was lost. Throughout the duration of this UFO sighting, Skylab was in a blackout period and thus no radio contact with the MOCR in Houston via the STDN was possible. The first official report of this UFO sighting over the public net came from Skylab some four and a half years later. - [Lousma] Did you tell him about that satellite we saw? - [Bean] Yes, we saw a great satellite. We didn't know if we told you about it. - [Lousma] The closest and brightest one we've seen. - Huge one. - We've seen several. It was a red one. [CAPCOM] No, you may have told somebody but it wasn't this team. I don't remember hearing about it. - [Lousma] I guess we didn't report it. It was reflecting in red light and oscillating. [lively music] - [Narrator] In the Skylab post mission, technical crew debriefing documentation, astronauts Garriott and Lousma commented further about the unidentified satellite they saw. - [Garriott] Do you want to talk about that satellite? - [Lousma] I saw one satellite that appeared like a satellite would own earth. I saw one that was not like one that you would see on earth, so why don't you mention it? - [Garriott] Okay, about a week or 10 days before recovery and we were still waiting for information to be supplied to us about the identification. Jack first notice this rather large red star out the wardroom window. It was much brighter than Jupiter or any of the other planets. It had a reddish hue to it, even though it was well above the horizon. It was slowly rotating because it had a variation in brightness with a 10 second period. As I was saying we observed it for about 10 minutes until we went into darkness, and it also followed us into darkness about five seconds later. From the five to ten second delay in its disappearance we surmise that it was not more than 30 to 50 nautical miles from our location. From its original position in the wardroom window, it did not move more than 10 or 20 degrees over the 10 minutes or so that we watched it. It's orbit was very close to that of our own. We never saw it on any earlier or succeeding orbits, and we would be quite interested in having its identification established. - [Narrator] Commander Alan Bean also kept an in-flight personal diary during his Skylab flight where he briefly references this UFO encounter. [lively music] According to NORAD SSN space object catalog tracking data, no known satellites or orbital debris were anywhere near Skylab during this encounter. There is no doubt that the Skylab 3 SLM-2 crew observed and photographed a UFO during their mission, but there were several inconsistencies in the official evidence related to this incident that still should be noted. How long did the Skylab crew observe this UFO? In the post-mission technical crew debriefing, Lousma and Garriott both agreed they observed the UFO for about 10 minutes before it and Skylab passed into darkness. However, in CDR Alan Bean's in-flight diary entry written just a few hours after the sighting he directly States the UFO drifted along with us for 20 minutes or more. Which crossed the sunset terminator first, Skylab or the UFO? In the same technical crew debriefing document Owen Garriott States the Skylab cross the terminator into darkness first, and then the UFO, "Followed us into darkness about five seconds later." Jack Lousma told mission control that the UFO "Let us into sunset." According to NASA, there were a total of four photographs of this UFO that were shot by the Skylab crew during this encounter, taken with a 35 millimeter camera using a 300 millimeter lens. NASA's official Skylab photographic index and scene identification catalog, twice references these four specific frames of film, frames 2138 through to 2141. On page 41, the four frames were cataloged as showing "Satellite, unmanned." And what about the Channel-A tapes? Aboard Skylab was a voice recording system designed to tape any conversations the astronauts had amongst themselves inside the station, when they were out of direct radio contact with Houston. According to NASA the Channel-A taping system was not active during the UFO encounter. So we have no audio or transcripts of the astronaut conversations that took place during the sighting. However, during the post-mission technical crew debriefing Owen Garriott says that the Channel-A tape system was active during the UFO encounter. This UFO encounter during Skylab 3 mission remains unexplained to this day. - We're at a disadvantage here in studying this subject because we are dealing with a structure of secrecy that has a lot of the cards that we don't have. But we still do have the ability to learn some facts, and we have the ability to make inferences based on the facts that we know. And we actually know a fair number of facts about clandestine activities in space, and anomalous events in earth orbit and beyond. We do actually have good information on that. So by working with that information, the fact that you might know that NORAD, for example, does and has tracked objects coming in from deep space to earth orbit. More than once this has happened. I know of two specific events during the 1980s when this absolutely happened. - We have thousands of satellites orbiting the earth and some of them are aimed outward like the telescopes in orbit, but many of them, the majority of them are aiming down. It's weather, or it's defense related, right? I want to know where those tanks are, that kind of thing. And they're very good cameras. I mean, they can probably read the license plate on my car, I don't know, but something close to that resolution. In other words, anything that's more than a couple of inches in size, they can see. So if we were really being visited by alien craft some of these satellites would see them. - One, there was a woman whose name is Simone Mendez, she's around, she was active US Air Force in the early 1980s and unfortunately for her she was presented with information that was illegal for her to see. She gotten a lot of trouble about it. But this information was NORAD, that's North American Air Defense, data describing an object, and not a natural object, coming in from deep space, and parking itself in earth orbit. And she learned about this, and she wasn't supposed to learn about it, and not only Air Force Military Police, but the FBI was on her case for a long time, and they made her life miserable. And her documentation is available, I have seen it, I've held it in my hands. She's a slam dunk, that's real. There's another case that I actually, I have it, I have this little study by a friend of mine who worked at Aerojet which is a major defense contractor that built the DSP system. That is the defense satellite program. These are geosynchronous satellites system, the defense satellite program that were designed to detect missile launches and things like that, but are also outstanding UFO detectors, just turns out that way. They've got all these sensor arrays on them and optical equipment. And on one occasion on May 5th 1984, the author of this study is Ron Regehr he worked at Aerojet for quite a few years. - [Announcer] Experts from DSP are revealing this information for the first time. - We saw something. - The DSP satellite is in fact a spy satellite. - [Ron] The confirmation that an event of some type. - One of these DSP satellites tracked, its sensors read an object that came to it within three kilometer distance in space. That's reach out and touch someone distance. That's very close. It was a nine minute long encounter. And it was a very puzzling thing for the analysts who saw that because they, what could that be? That's an amazingly maneuverable object, got them at scratching their heads. Knew that Ron is also a very good and seasoned UFO investigator, so he knows his field. And he gained, legally, by the way, none of this is illegal, he gained access to some bits of information here and there, relating to the DSPs tracking of what are known as Fastwalkers that is space based UFOs. And there's a database that it derives from which is called the Individual Target Event Database nicknamed Itty Bitty. Look at the acronym, the Itty Bitty database. And what that is, is it's a tracking of the DSP tracked fastwalkers, so all the space based UFOs. And I think from 1970, Ron got a printout of all of their trackings, and I got them right here, I mean, this looks like a lot of mumbo jumbo, but these are readouts of fastwalker trackings by year, this is 1987, '88, '89. Basically about three per month. So from 1973 to 1991 was something like 283 fastwalkers were tracked by the DSP system. Now, that means uncorrelated targets, targets that they got that they didn't know what these could be. They were not Russian or Soviet, they were not any other that they knew. But what Ron got here was facts from, and this strikes me as something that's unofficial but probably true. He has is gentleman who actually, I knew him and he's no longer alive, who says, "I have information that is such and such a time, Zulu May 5th, 1984, a DSP platform detected an object, with heat, in the 9000 kilowatt sensor range coming out of deep space, coming out of deep space and passing within three kilometers of the DSP. The DSP star tracking telescope first detected the object." And they use this, and he points out here, the optical system that he's referring to is used for the DSP to gauge its position accurately against known stars. So it has optical equipment, and this optical equipment detected this thing. And he goes on to say, "The observation lasted nine minutes a detailed investigation failed to explain what caused the sensor reading, other than a real object of some type." And this is a drawing that came in, or a graphic that came in with the facts. [suspenseful music] But some of them do correlate with known UFO events. So for example one of them on this database, is an exact correlation with a very famous UFO event from the city of Tehran, Iran in September 1976. It's known as a Tehran UFO encounter, and it's amazing encounter, got a couple of F-4s attempting to intercept an amazing object that just bouncing all over the sky. And I mean, and more and they couldn't. - [Announcer] A now retired pilot is one of forty men mainly former government and military officials from seven different countries talking about their UFO experiences. This conference took place in Washington and the cast of characters was almost strangely, well, inventional. One of the believers, this retired Iranian Air Force pilot said he saw UFO while flying. - It looked similar to us from far, but bigger and brighter. - [Announcer] General Parvis Jafari says he tried to fire a missile, but much of his plane became inoperative. - All the instrument was fluctuating, the radio had garble, even I couldn't have communication with my pilot in my backseat who was operating the radar. - So none of your equipment worked? Your missiles didn't work, do you think it's because this was an alien from another world? - Oh yes. - You're sure of that? - Yeah, I'm sure. At about 11:00 PM on the evening of 18th September, 1976, citizens are frightened by circling of an unknown object over Tehran, the capital city of Iran at a low altitude. It looked similar to a star, but bigger and brighter. - [Narrator] In 1976, a massive UFO sighting took place in Iran. This UFO sighting was also picked up by the DSP satellite system as a fastwalker. - All of a sudden I see this flying object just going round, and round, and round, and going up, and up, and up. And I told my mom, I said, "Mom, I just saw a flying saucer, I saw UFO." - I was going to prepare myself to shoot it down. - [Narrator] This UFO event was witnessed by hundreds of people in the night sky. Civilians, pilots, generals, and the unerring eye of the Iranian Air Force Radar operators. - When I saw this object is flying that fast, then I thought this is not the helicopter, and this is not an aircraft. By that time I said, "Should be some kind of UFO." - Well, I picked up the phone and it was a base commander, he wanted me to know they're going to have the airplanes to take off from his base for the scrambled mission. - He alerted the Air Force Command Post and Deputy General Yousefi decided to scramble an F-4 jet to investigate. - [Pilot] I saw a big star among the other stars, which it was at least twice as large as the normal stars. - The pilot in the first jet lost instrumentation and communication when he got too close to the brilliant object. So he headed back. - We lost communication and I heard nothing from the pilots. So I was so scared, what's going to happen, and what happened to the pilot? - [Narrator] Suddenly major Jafari nervously reported that a smaller UFO had emerged from the larger object and was trying to engage him. - And it was coming toward them, they tried to shoot them down. When they squeeze the trigger, it didn't work, and the trigger was inoperative. They couldn't shoot the missiles. - [Narrator] Fearing for their lives, the pilot tried to eject, but the ejection did not work either. Every system was inoperable. - We understood that the eject missile and arsenal didn't work. So in this case, I said to God, "Oh God, save them." - [Narrator] The pilot had no choice, but to go into negative G-Force to escape the seemingly hostile UFO encounter. When the fighter jet evaded the smaller UFO by 10 miles all onboard instruments and communications were restored to their working order. The pilot then reported that the UFO seemed to be landing on a mountaintop just south east of Tehran. This Landing was confirmed by the radar tower and Brigadier-General Yousefi witnessed it from his balcony with his own eyes. - One of the separated objects landed in an open area radiating a high bright light in which the sands on the ground were visible. - He did it down and landed on the ground. And now it is a communication between the mothership and that small flying object. - [Narrator] Following the smaller UFO landing the Air Force and many civilians reported power outages which shocked military personnel in awe of these events taking place. - That was strange for us. And we ask each other why the power went out for some seconds. - A top secret meeting between Imperial Iranian Air Force and the United States Air Force took place soon after this event. Hossein Pirouzi an Air Force controller at Mehrabad Air Force Base was present at this meeting. - They heard our report and the report of the pilot, they concluded that no country is able to have such a technology. And all of them believe it should be a strange object from other space. - Anyway, so the DSP satellite system detected that object, apparently. Yeah, on that day, it's amazing. - DSP as I explained before is an infrared based detector of things launched from the earth or entering into the earth's atmosphere because we know it can detect, what we call fastwalkers. So the DSP can be pointed, so it can be aimed at a country like Iran and the city of Tehran. So if it's aimed in that direction and it produces a report of a infrared detection, that's some large incident, and that happens at exactly the same time contemporaneously with the Iranian, Tehran based fighter jet the F-4, ran into a UFO, tried to shoot it down. So we don't have a hundred percent proof there the same but it is really hard to imagine. You can have an infrared detection that happens almost simultaneously with the UFO detection and the two not be related. So it's just, what this says is those old, tiny spacecraft that are no longer produced, no longer made, can detect UFOs entering the earth's atmosphere. Imagine what we could do with the current technology. And so that goes back to the essay Chris Mellon did which means if we could detect them with old technology we could really do a really good job with the current modern spacecraft we have in orbit. - [Announcer] The satellite was scanning the skies over Tehran. - Here is the event. - My point is we have enough good information that we can work with. And yes, there's nothing wrong with reasonable speculation. Sometimes you have to do it, I do it. Because we don't have every piece of the puzzle, and we want to know what that picture looks like. So we do our best, and we're probably wrong with some of our speculations, probably, that's life. But that's a responsible thing as long as you know what you're doing. You're trying to figure out this difficult puzzle. [gentle music] - [Narrator] Commencing on April 12th 1981 with STS-1 in a new reusable spacecraft, would lead the way in a new era for NASA's public space missions. - [Mission Control] 3, 2, 1, 0 and liftoff on Endeavor, going where east and west do meet, at the International Space Station. - Houston now controlling. - Houston Endeavor roll program. - Roger roll, Endeavor. [upbeat music] [upbeat music continues] - [Narrator] NASA's Space Shuttle STS missions were packed with technical achievements as they transported people, equipment, and supplies to and from low earth orbit, while supporting the construction and maintenance of the International Space Station. This reusable spacecraft was designed to embark on a wide range of thrilling missions including deploying and retrieving satellites, servicing, and conducting cutting-edge scientific experiments. - Is at the very end. This is New Guinea. Doing a little tour. This is the FGB, and what's cool about this module, it is actually the very first piece of the space station that came up in 1998. The space station has been around for about now, man for 12 years, but it's been up in space for about 14 years. And this was the very first. It is like the Russian's PMM, it has a lot of storage as you can see. [gentle music] [gentle music continues] [speaking a foreign language] So here we are in the heart of the space station really, this is the service module. This is the central post. In case we had any problems, I know when it's a couple of the questions were about what type of things do you have to worry about, and some of the things we have to worry about in space are fire, if we had a fire, if we had a depressionization like we're hit by a micrometeorite and it made a hole, or if we had some type of toxic atmosphere. We use ammonia for our radiator, so there is a possibility that ammonia could come into the vehicle and then it would be bad for all of us. If we have any of those problems we come right here, which we call the Central Post. It is the main heart of the space station. It was also the first computers that came up here that ran the space station. So behind this wall right here are these main computers. So we gather here as a group of three or six, and then figure out how we're going to either fight the fire, patch the hole, or solve the toxic spill. And what's cool about this module, of course, it's the central post, it also has great windows right down toward earth. It has controls to fly in visiting spacecraft if they need some assistance right here. It has Russian computers as well as American computers to help us control anything we need to on the space station. - [Narrator] This program's ultimate goal was to ignite the imaginations of future generations by achieving our knowledge in exciting fields like aerodynamics, material science, and life science. [gentle music] The program ran for a 135 missions, culminating in 2011 with a final flight by the shuttle Atlantis. [gentle music] - The stuff that NASA has released, or talked about astronauts have seen stuff following the Space Station, or capsules, or whatever, I think they're observing us. There's some speculation that aliens are responsible for us not getting into a nuclear war with the Soviets or the Chinese. - NASA has had a number of cases where they have dealt in some fashion with UFOs. And of course that is, I'm sure classified and kept secret and hidden from the public. - [Narrator] STS-29 was off to a great start in terms of making space history. As the primary payload, the tracking and data relay satellite 4, TDRS-4, was attached to an inertial upper stage IUS. It was set to be the third TDRS to be deployed. Once deployed, the IUS shot the satellite into geosynchronous orbit, but what the crew witness next was far beyond their imagination. As the crew conducted various secondary payloads, including experiments like protein crystal growth and chromosomes, and plate cell division, they couldn't shake off what they saw. John E. Blaha was overheard saying something very odd in terms of UFO activity. While the debate surrounding this statement's authenticity would ensue. - Check the risk disconnects to open. Don the thumb loose. [suspenseful music] - [Narrator] It was evident that this mission would go down in history as the one that witnessed something unexplainable. - There was an incident with a space shuttle Discovery where Don Ratch, a UFO researcher was listening. He liked to listen to the shuttle talking back and forth with Houston. After an hour and a half, he heard one of the astronauts say we have a fire. Maybe they had a fire, maybe they didn't, nobody seemed to be getting excited. And UFO researchers think that what happens in that situation is that they have spotted a UFO, or some kind of extraterrestrial spacecraft and that's a code that they use to describe that. So he sat down right away and started recording. - [Astronaut] Houston, this is Discovery we still have a alien spacecraft under observance. - And a couple minutes later, he heard that someone on that same channel he'd been listening to, NASA was presented with that, they denied that that was an astronaut. Although it was on that same channel. I guess you need about 20 words for a voice print analysis and there are only a 13 words so we could not prove that it was somebody at NASA saying that, but it's kind of fishy, because it was on that same channel that Don Ratch had been listening to for a couple hours. That would have to be a very classified topic. - On the thumb loose. - Houston, this is Discovery we still have a alien spacecraft under observance. - I'm just driving back from a little visit that I paid the JFK Space Center, located in Florida. I had heard through fellow UFO researchers about seeing the shuttle Atlantis that's decommissioned their Space Center. The incredible thing about this craft, which very few people actually know, is that it's completely covered with high-tech space cameras. When I say space cameras, I mean cameras that are built to withstand the unfiltered light and the harsh conditions of lunar space, outside of the earth's atmosphere. Now few people are aware that this remarkable spacecraft has cutting edge technology for recording video. They actually outfit the spacecraft with far ultraviolet light spectrum space cameras. And what's also very cool about this is that you can see the cameras all over the craft. And we're not talking about like four or five, there are cameras all over the interior of the shuttle bay for deploying satellites, and parts that were used to outfit the International Space Station. They also have cameras on the end of every robotic arm. And there were multiple robotic arms that were connected to the shuttle. You also have the fact that all of these astronauts that went up into space, to eventually join the ISS, or to just do a round trip on the shuttle, were well equipped with cameras. Either on the ISS or inside of the compartments, the pressurized compartment for the shuttle spacecraft. And a lot of the videos that people question, are these actual UFOs flying around in space outside of earth are being caught on these specialized space cameras? So when people say, "Oh well, I don't believe that video because it's probably just 3D, or CGI, or somebody's manipulated the image." No, that's not the case. These videos are being caught on government operated NASA space cameras, which are untampered with. And they're incredibly important videos most of the time because they're just as important as let's say the videos you see being shot by the fighter craft in which we got the Tic Tac UFO, the Nimitz go fast, Gimbal UFO videos from. So, I think what you'll see when we go through all of this UFO video, possible UFO activity video that comes from the NASA space missions, you will see that we're looking at cameras that are capturing this in space. And astronauts sometimes talking about what they saw on camera before they cut the feed, or obscure the image, or what they classically do to cover up the UFO. [gentle music] - [Narrator] One type of camera that was continually capturing these objects interacting with earth and space is called a far light ultraviolet spectrum camera. During the 1990s NASA carried out space shuttle missions and recorded footage like this. In this footage of what seems to be a formation of objects moving over the earth, one object can be seen escaping the atmosphere as we hear NASA explaining the technology of what they use to capture these images. - [NASA Narrator] Mission Control Houston. This view is being taken with the Glow Camera. Housed in Endeavor's payload bay is one of four different experiments that are hitching a ride with the International Extreme Ultraviolet Hitchhiker payload that is housed in Endeavor's payload bay. - [Narrator] A Glow Camera is a code name used for the technology that can capture things which cannot be seen by the human eye, but are visible in the ultraviolet light spectrum. This special light spectrum camera technology was extremely expensive at the time. It is also similar to what civilian researchers and military personnel have caught on infrared cameras around the world today. Martyn Stubbs, a Canadian television broadcast station manager took interest in UFOs back in the late 80s and early 90s. Martyn knew that he could use the television station satellite dish to intercept NASA's STS mission video downlink in order to observe what they were seeing and doing in space. - Get a video tape recorder an SVH machine. An older model funny enough, not the digital model, that literally when you roll the thing it would break the frames into fields. And in reality, there are 60 individual pictures that make up one second of video And that's when I found. [phone ringing] - Hello. - Hey Martyn. - Hello. - How you doing? It's Darcy, can you hear me? - Yeah. - No, perfect. This is sounding a hundred percent way better. It's just, you were cutting up a bit there. So. - What I basically, because of the nature of my work I had access to space and I couldn't understand why nobody was interested in it. I was with MUFON and they said, "Oh." I said, "Isn't anybody doing this?" And they weren't, so it just amazes me because it's very rare you get access to something like that and nobody else in the world is doing it, and enough to pay the attention I did. And then I ended up with hours, and hours, and hours, and hours, every hour of every flight I had on video. I set up recording banks in my office and then just put them all on, record the the signals because I couldn't watch them, I had a job to do full time. And so I took them home at night and looked at them and realized what I had, and needed to learn a lot about it, needed to to do more than just react. So I sat on them and contacted various people I needed to contact, and everything went from there. - [Pilot] This is a view of Chicago and also some [suspenseful music] ice crystals or other items being eliminated by the rising sun, Atlanta is moving into sunrise. - A man tonight has his eyes on the skies looking for objects that may be out of this world. - What he found so far will get you thinking about life on other planets. Tony Lopez in the newsroom with incredible pictures. - They really are, we see a big bright object that lights up the night sky, chances are it's the big bright moon, right? But what if that object is moving? And what if that object can't be explained? - Almost a blur under the plane and pulled up front. - Don't call the guy with a pack of cigs and a battery crazy or lazy. A spinal injury means Jeff Challender spends most of this time in bed. What he sees from his perch is out of this world. - Well that looks good. - Jeff records and studies images from the NASA Television channel. Most of it's been uneventful, most of it. - We're gonna cross that one that just, whoa, what was that? - That was this. The bride object ripping through space. - I ran the tape back a little bit, watched it again, and I watched it again, and I'm hollering down the hall, "Hey, honey, you gotta come see this." - [Tony] The object caught on tape did not come from, say, the camcorder of a UFO enthusiast, but from NASA during the shuttle Atlantis mission in September of 2000. Since 1999, Jeff figures he's seen at least a hundred of what he calls anomalous events, a fancy way of saying UFOs. Here's another one, recorded during the recent Discovery mission, and yet another. - They're not an ice chip, they're not a piece of debris, it's not the moon, it's not a star, not another spacecraft, not a satellite. - [Narrator] Jeffrey Challender was a NASA mission researcher who stumbled upon some strange behavior being demonstrated on video during NASA's STS missions. Jeffrey pondered why the video which NASA beamed back to earth from their space cameras was so noisy, and filled with distortions. He thought, "Well if all our TV and satellite programing comes from space clearly, why would NASA's come through so horribly." Jeff witnessed several instances where NASA had clear video broadcasts, but suddenly introduced noise distortion and color banding that seemed to have been intentionally added by NASA to obscure the picture. By watching NASA's STS mission videos later, one may come across anomalies that could be labeled as possible UFO sightings. It is observed that NASA employs various methods to cover up such incidents in the video feed. These protocols include obfuscating the footage with digital noise or changing the camera direction, switching to another camera, or completely cutting off the video feed when an anomalous object is detected. All these actions are carried out by Mission Control through the CATO communication and tracking officers stationed on earth. [NASA Narrator] Different camera angle, we get a little view of the Astro-2 telescopes moving off-screen now as the camera is panned upward and gives us a look at the sky above Endeavor. With stars visible on this black and white camera, a low light sensitive camera. But we now have lost- - I got a chance to sit down with James Fox, filmmaker and researcher of the UFO phenomenon. He in his years spoke to many astronauts some of which were in support of the idea that extraterrestrials may be visiting earth, others who were not. - I was told by very close source of yours that you actually saw something other than- - A lot of people have said things that I saw, that doesn't mean that I saw it. - The last time I called him he said, "Why don't you go talk to," because I've got a telephone number in my phone. He said, "why don't you go talk to your buddy Edgar Mitchell?" He'll let him do the talking, and very dismissive. And his sister said to me, I was in the parking lot of College of Marin in Kentfield, California, and I was just leaving the parking lot and I talked to a fan, and she goes, And I said to her, "Can you believe what happened on CNN?" She goes, "Somebody got to him." I said, "What do you mean?" She goes, "Somebody got to him, he won't even talk to me anymore about it, he's denying it to me." That's what she told me, I swear to God. I know it sounds crazy, but she said somebody's gotten him because he won't even share with me anymore. - Statistically it's a certainty there are hugely advanced civilizations, intelligence lifeforms out there. I believe they're so advanced that they're even doing interstellar travel. I believe it's possible. - Suddenly I look up and I see these five lights and they seem to fly by. - [Dr. Brian] There is abundant evidence that we are being contacted, that civilizations have been visiting us for a very long time. And it was only later when I began to embrace the UFO phenomenon, the cover up, studying all these organizations that are covering up, and having some direct experience myself as a researcher, no longer beholden to funding from NASA or the university environment, that I began to double check some of Carl's work and I saw for example, the famous face in Cydonia on Mars photographed by Viking in 1975, which shows this gigantic human Mesa that resembles a human face about a mile across. Carl was, and I debated this, and it was very, very disappointing to me because not only was Carl wrong, he also fudged data. He he published a picture of the face, and Parade Magazine a popular article saying that the face is just a natural formation, but he doctored the picture to make it not look like a face and I began to realize just directly, from a scientific point of view, not only hearsay, that this man was colluding with NASA, that there might be more to this than before. - And of course eventually I ran into Jesse Marcel Jr. The son of Jesse Marcel who was the first military officer on the site, and knew his story well, we became friends in later years in this disclosure movement. And at some point about 10 years ago, and I can't remember what date it was right now, When the disclosure movement was under going strongly. I came here to Washington with a Navy Commander with the name of Will Miller, and Dr. Steven Greer. And we were able to get an appointment at the Pentagon to talk about what we knew, or what we allegedly knew, what we thought we knew. And went and told our story. And the powers would be at the Intelligence Committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff listen to our story and said, the Admiral said, "Well, I don't know that story, I don't know that that's true, but I will find out." So we departed, went on our way. And subsequently learned through Dr. Greer and through Will Miller that those stories had been confirmed. And that the Admiral had been denied access when he tried to get into the inner workings of that process. And we had confirmation of that although that Admiral now denies the fact that this is the fact. - And maybe Edgar- - I don't believe that Edgar did, I sat down in his home, and I was dying to know what he knew. I was begging with him. And he said, "No, as far as I know none of my friends have had encounters in space." And I said, "What about James McDivitt?" He goes, "Well actually, yeah there." But I interviewed Gordon Cooper as well, and Gordon Cooper said there's rumor circulating about me seeing UFOs in space, but I didn't. He goes, "I did see UFO when I was piloting a jet in Germany and tried to chase it. And we did have the UFO that landed at Edwards Air Force Base." Which I saw the film footage of, he didn't film it. - That was your interview. - That was my interview, yes. - [Narrator] The STS 51-A mission delivered the Canadian communications satellite TELESAT-H ANIK to geosynchronous orbit, on flight day two, attached to the Payload Assist Module-D PAM-D. On the third day, the defense communications satellite SYNCOM IV-I, also known as LEASAT-1 was also deployed. In a daring maneuver, Allen and Gardner, equipped with jet-propelled manned maneuvering units, retrieved two malfunctioning satellites, PALAPA-B2 and WESTAR-VI, previously deployed on Mission 41-B. Fisher expertly operated the remote manipulator system, successfully grappling the satellites and placing them in the payload bay. During the maneuver in which WESTAR-VI was being collected by one of the astronauts, this peculiar metallic looking sphere can be seen flying in behind as if it had dropped in to take a look. [suspenseful music] UFOs like this have been observed on multiple occasions throughout history. Including this Cable TV broadcast in which a NASA downlink is streaming live space camera footage. [suspenseful music] The sphere like UFO was observed. [bright music] Many people have shared sphere UFO footage from around the world in our atmosphere too. [bright music] Which includes Jeremy Korbel's recent Mosul IRAQ, UFO image release. - What you see in this image, is you see the first ever released, US military filmed UFO over a conflict Zone. It is officially designated UFO or UAP, unidentified anomalous phenomena, that is actively being investigated. - [John] Hi, John Holliman at CNN Center in Atlanta, we're going to take you live to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida where the countdown clock is ticking off the final two minutes and 12 seconds before launch for Space Shuttle Discovery. - [Narrator] STS 63 made history with several groundbreaking achievements, including the first female shuttle pilot, the second Russian cosmonaut flight on a shuttle, and the first shuttle approach and flyaround of the Russian Space Station Mir. Starting on day one, thruster burns were performed daily to align Discovery with Mir. The plan was for the orbiter to approach no closer than 10 meters from Mir and complete the flyaround. [gentle music] However, three of 44 Reaction Control System thrusters developed leaks before the rendezvous. Interestingly though, the crew on this mission would start naming objects being seen in the special UV cameras as ice crystals. [gentle music] Perhaps though, they were covering up possible sightings of UFOs in a different light spectrum. [gentle music] - [Astronaut] Houston, we're looking at our payload camera and looks like a lot of moonlight glinting off the ocean. A whole sparkling bed of diamonds out there. Is that a real picture, or are we just getting some video fuzz? - [Astronaut] We're recording that. That's some of the ice crystals that we were dumping out earlier, and yeah it's a beautiful picture. - If there are code words then I think it's pretty clear, the astronauts would have to know them before they go up into orbit. And then if they use them, fine, if they see something. - [Astronaut] We see another light going by on the ground there. - That would have to come, I would think, from some astronauts being debriefed, and mentioning that they had seen something, or else that NASA suspects that it's possible that they might see something, and so they developed some code words to use. - [Narrator] STS-69 made history by retrieving and deploying two different payloads on the same mission, while also conducting an extravehicular activity to practice for International Space Station tasks and assess space suit modifications. [lively music] During the mission's second day, Spartan 201-03, the first of two primary payloads, was deployed. Its mission objective was to study the outer atmosphere of the sun and its transition into the solar wind that passes earth. [lively music] During this deployment a UFO was witnessed on camera by ground control flying in the background and changing it's direction. [lively music] [lively music continues] - [Darcy] Now, let me ask you. When people mention the B2 bomber and then you hear about the Phoenix Lights, or people mention the Mac Air. Do you think that there's, we've got to a point, I mean, I see the interviews from Bob Lazar, he says we're nowhere close to reverse engineering, back when he was working on the project and propulsion system. But then Ben Rich contradicts that and says we're 50 years beyond your comprehension. Do you think there are some triangular shaped craft that we have developed that follow the description of what people describe as like the TR-3B? - I would have to say yes. There isn't anything out there flying regardless of the shape that we don't have the capabilities of reproducing using conventional means for propulsion. Now there's been reports, you see a UFO heading down this way at 4,000 miles an hour and it makes a 90 degree turn. You're pulling 40 G's on that turn. A buddy of mine from the skunkwork said we can do that, we can do that any day of the week, not with humans in it. But we put control computers in artillery rounds where we can, once they're fired, and it's a tremendous explosion, but push that thing out the barrel, and the fins come out and this thing's guided to precisely hit where it wants to go, and they're pulling 40 to 100 G's on detonation. So we have the hardware and the electronics that can withstand those extremes. But they're not they're not human rated, nor could a human withstand those under normal circumstances. - [Darcy] So you worked on some aircraft, I think it was 1972, you said, that had a drone attached to the top of it. You think that some of the Delta shapes crafts that were seeing and hearing about might be drones to some degree? - Absolutely. I mean, some of the stuff that people are seeing AND airline pilots and other people, trained observers. - NASA. - Guys from NASA and Air Force types, whatever, the first time I saw an F-117 at sunset, as the sun was going down, the light was changing on the faceted surfaces, it looked like the F-117 was changing shape. And if you look at a head-on view of an F-117 it goes, it's a flying saucer if you look at it straight on. Now if you just saw a glimpse of it, or you saw the backside of it, it could be mistaken for almost anything. - [Narrator] STS-73 was a mission of historic proportions, marked by the second flight of the U.S. Microgravity Laboratory, USML. Building on the foundation laid by its predecessor, which flew on Columbia during Mission STS-50 in 1992, this mission was critical on the advancement of space research. The crew was divided into two teams, working around the clock in the 23-foot, seven-meter long Space module located in Columbia's payload bay. The pressure was on as the team prepared to tackle research in five crucial areas. On October 21st 1995, Catherine Coleman is seen peering out a capsule window when she is overheard saying this to the ground control. - [Catherine] We have an unidentified flying object. - [Narrator] After this, the communication goes completely silent. It is well known that the astronauts have two radio channels, one that is public and another for the Department of Defense. It remains a possibility that the rest of the conversation would have been carried on through an encrypted DOD channel. - There were some shuttle missions that were highly classified that supported the Strategic Defense Initiative, where we had launched satellites into space from the STS vehicles, for particular purpose. I don't know what the purpose was, I was never briefed in why they were doing it, but you can guess what they were trying to do. And that was a good disguise or cover for deep space probes, that I knew we had and it's been released to the public now, over the years people have figured it out, where we were launching deep space probes where these probes would go out near the orbit of Mars or even as far as Neptune, to safeguard the solar system. And that was the secret space program that I knew about. I didn't know about any other kind of secret space program, but I knew that we were able to manufacture the satellites back in those days, and launch these, and they were highly classified, out into space. I don't know how many were out there but there's some people that, there are other people within the community that knows a lot more about this than I do. That knows that there's 10 or 12 of them that are still out there looking for visitors coming in, so to speak, from other planets. - Fastwalkers? - Fastwalkers, yes. - [Commentator] To ride the astronaut van out to Pad 39B. - STS-80. - Houston go ahead throttle up. - Throttle up. - [Narrator] The final shuttle flight of 1996 was full of incredible sightings. It was highlighted by the successful deployment, operation, and retrieval of two free-flying research spacecraft. [lively music] The two planned extravehicular activities, EVAs were canceled. On flight day one, the Orbiting and Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer-Shuttle Pallet Satellite II, ORFEUS-SPAS II was deployed, ready to begin its approximately two weeks of data-gathering. This was its second flight aboard the shuttle and it was packed with three primary scientific instruments the ORFEUS-Telescope with the Far Ultraviolet FUV Spectrograph. November 1996, during the STS-80 mission, NASA captured fascinating footage of what appears to be UFO sightings. [lively music] [lively music continues] In the recording, peculiar objects can be seen moving over Africa, [lively music] [lively music continues] with the most notable visualization being an object that enters the camera's shot in a transparent or almost corporeal state, only to shine into existence once it finds its position within the atmosphere. [lively music] Additionally, there seem to be multiple objects that appear to hold a circular formation, with the final object moving into the center and lighting up. The illuminated objects seem to stay cohesively in this formation, blinking with the few along the top ascending back into orbit. Could space junk or ice perform these kinds of maneuvers? [lively music] The seemingly deliberate nature of the movement of these objects seems near impossible to explain away as naturally occurring phenomena. Former NASA employee Jim Oberg has determined the objects to be just ice, which can be illuminated based on near-earth conditions. However, other scientists like Dr. Jack Kasher say that this explanation is impossible. [lively music] Also, during STS-80 this UFO activity was captured while a storm was taking place on earth. At the beginning of this sequence we see a UFO fly into view until it finds its place over the electrical storm below. The first object literally descends, slows down, and then finally holds its position. Would space ice be able to move like this and then maintain its place so gracefully? [lively music] Later on we see that three objects have congregated over this same location that we originally saw this electrical storm taking place. [lively music] [lively music continues] [lively music continues] Even more peculiar is that the NASA camera operator seems to take interest in these objects, exemplified by their zooming in to get a better shot of the objects. In which we can see the original object ascending while another descends into the atmosphere. [lively music] Is this not evidence that NASA at least holds some interest in tracking unidentified objects? [lively music] [lively music continues] - [Astronaut] The satellite. [lively music] Again, just moving into sunrise. [lively music] 81 nautical miles now from Columbia. - [Astronaut] Columbia, Houston could you tell us what your TV view is showing? - [Houston] Well, the sun has actually risen on the belly side of the orbiter so we're getting some light scattered down from a very bright pale onto the camera lens. And then those little white dots moving around are little ice crystals surrounding the orbiter. So as we come into across the terminator, guess we'll turn on one of the color cameras. [lively music] - [Astronaut] Copy that, I was waiting for the opening credits of "Star Trek" to go down the screen there. - So how do you know if a signal is due to ET or just due to other humans? That's a problem that's existed for a long time. So the answer these days is fairly sophisticated in this sense, that it's a good filter to be able to throw out the stuff that you really not interested in. To begin with, there's this big database that's kept by all the radio observatories that are looking for ET of known interference causers, which some, for example GPS transmitters, right? The GPS satellites, they're sending down signals to earth all the time, and you occasionally pick those up, if not from our system, but from the ones used by the Russians, for example. So these are, they're just known interferes if you will, and known noise makers, and if you pick up a signal that's at the frequency of a known noise maker, you can ignore it. That's one thing you do, but the the really acid test for deciding whether this signal is really it, Bob, or is this just another a bit of interference? Is if you pick up suddenly, you're looking at a particular direction, you just move the antenna a little bit so you're not looking in that direction, you're looking at another direction. Do you still see the signal? If it's terrestrial interference, it's something man-made, You'll find the signal almost anywhere you look, okay? But if you don't see it, then you say, "Well, okay, I'll move the antenna back and point at that star system again and see if I pick up the signal again." So nodding back and forth, nodding the telescope around the sky near the source is a very, very solid indicator of whether this is something you should spend more time on. - [Darcy] We live in fascinating times. Avi Loeb a prominent astrophysicist and professor at Harvard University has gained attention in recent years for his controversial claims about a possibility of an alien technology that might have visited our solar system in 2017, Oumuamua, a large Interstellar object. Now, since then Avi Loeb's project Galileo has been launched, a not-for-profit organization that aims to search for and study potential technological artifacts, or evidence of extraterrestrial life in our solar system. I got to talk to HawkEye 360s founder, Bob McGuire. Bob McGuire makes a living by building satellites that go into low earth orbit. He knows full well that there are UAP floating around in space, but he is dubious about this project that Avi Loeb is launching. - Avi Loeb is at Harvard University which is a private university. And he has secured funding to do the work on Project Galileo to some extent. Seth implies that he has enough money to put a few observatories out. So a few observatories are not going to blank at the sky with coverage, we won't find everything that's in low earth orbit, or in air atmosphere because the capabilities of these observatories will be only a handful of square miles on the surface. There's just, the probability of a significant detection is low. So Avi needs lots, and lots, and lots of money to build enough observatories to cover a significant fraction of the earth. So the probability of detection of UFOs or UAP's goes way up. If in fact they're visiting, then the probability goes up as you increase the coverage more. And Avi right now is trying to find funding to do that. Seth is on his advisory group, and I do believe that we should figure out what these UAP's are, but I think it's going to, I have a hard time understanding how we're ever going to build enough sensors privately to look up all the way to low earth orbit. Yeah, I really, I support SETI, I support SETI's use of highly advanced scientific instruments to look at other star systems, to see if we can detect signals that are produced by intelligent life. Because the Earth is rotating where the antenna is, so the signal goes up in strength, and then down in strength. So that's how you know, it's outside of the earth. If you determine these Newtonian physics, Einstein and Newtonian together, which says speed of light is the limit, they can't figure out we're here to aim a signal at us and then wait 50,000 years for the signal to get here, and 50,000 years for us to respond, what's the point? Okay so, either they travel faster than the speed of light and they're visiting us, or there's no point in them sending a signal that we can detect. And you only see it once so what do you gain by that? You don't gain much. I'm happy for private dollars to be spent on SETI. Why do I support that? I'll tell you why, my tax dollars don't pay for it. Because that's such a low probability event that I don't want my tax dollars being spent for that. - [Darcy] Can you tell me a bit about your experience finding out that maybe the NRO was putting up satellite systems or space probes that had the ability to see UFOs, but they had switched off that tracking from the system. - Okay, so I can explain that. So the government knows that it is trying to detect activity by our earth bound potential adversaries, so they have a sensor, they point it at the earth, and what they do is from all the events, one of these spacecrafts it detects, they filter what's coming from the spacecraft to identify the objects that they are interested in. They are literally throwing away in many cases, things like UFOs entering the earth's atmosphere because they're not interested in that because the Soviet Union, or Russia, or China, or North Korea is not going to send a UFO at us they're going to send an intercontinental ballistic missile to us. So their job is to detect activity by our adversaries that can harm our national interests, are national security threat to us. And so we, they necessarily filter out everything that is not one of these things that they care about because they're going to treat it like it's noise. And so they want to filter out all the noise, so they get really high quality detects of say missile launches. [gentle music] [gentle music continues] - [Narrator] STS-114. STS-114 was the first Return to Flight mission since the tragic loss of Columbia February 1st, 2003. Two and a half years were spent researching and implementing safety improvements for orbiters and external tanks. They included greater in-depth examination of reinforced carbon panels that are used on the wing leading edges, plus replacing bolts and new foam applications on the tanks. Discovery's climb to orbit was extensively documented through a system of new and upgraded ground-based cameras, radar systems, and airborne cameras aboard high altitude aircraft. [gentle music] The imagery captured of Discovery's launch, and additional imagery from laser systems on Discovery's new Orbiter Boom Sensor System laser-scanner as well as data from sensors embedded in the shuttle's wings, helped mission managers determine the health of Discovery's thermal protection system. [gentle music] During the mission, while the UV Camera peered out into space with the planet's horizon in the background, an object can be seen flying with intelligent control. [gentle music] It changes it's direction as it speeds off camera. [gentle music] [lively music] STS-115. The STS-115 crew was on a mission of utmost importance, tasked with delivering and installing the crucial P3/P4 truss structure on the International Space Station. With the success of the entire mission resting on their shoulders, the crew began their work, prepared to face any challenge that may lay ahead. Three perilous spacewalks were planned each one more challenging than the previous, as space walkers Joe Tanner, Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper, Dan Burbank, and Steve MacLean worked tirelessly to connect power cables and activate the new P3/P4 truss. However, this mission was not without surprises. Three separate UFO incidents were reported during the mission. In one incident, the crew tracked an object with a triangular formation of lights flying nearby. - [Astronaut] The best view we got was through the binoculars, and the best way I can describe it is there's some kind of reflective cloak, or metallic looking type of cloak of a structure that definitely not rigid, or it's not a solid metal structure. - [Astronaut] It Started it over Window 8 then quickly moved towards the nose, and we tracked it through windows one, two, three, four, and now it's at about windows five. It's moving away. Pans off, we're losing it. Right now it's about 12:30 and it's passing out in front of the vehicle. - [Ground Control] Copy that, can you get a still imagery if you can, and any estimate on size or range? - Visual on that? - We do see that. - [Astronaut] Okay, that's looking out in front of the Orbiter. - [Ground Control] Okay, we're seeing three or four objects, can you confirm that it's just the one that's actually moving, the other ones are just reflections. - [Astronaut] There are three objects, The one you see, you see two rings right there, they're the ones we had the late tally ho on, the one down the bottom, that was the one we initially saw. - Crazy alert, aliens after Atlantis? Official video from the latest NASA space shuttle mission appears to show what might be UFOs in space. A segment from the live NASA feed shows the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle Atlantis and what appears to be three flying objects directly above the shuttle. The objects are in motion in a triangular formation how we often imagine UFOs might move. The narrator of the live feed tries to explain the objects away with a less than convincing story, take a listen. - [Houston] This is Mission Control Houston with Atlantis Commander Brent, talking with us are on high alert here in Mission Control about an object the crew members noted outside the windows of this Space Shuttle Atlantis, describing it as some kind of reflective or metallic looking cloth, but definitely not a rigid or metal object. - Yeah right, there just happen to be three identical pieces of massive metallic cloth moving around in a constant formation in space. So one of the most convincing UFO videos yet, it appears more likely than ever that we might have company in our universe. - [Narrator] As the end of NASA's Atlantis shuttle mission STS-115 approached, the crew prepared for the crucial moment of making a controlled re-entry into the earth's atmosphere. But as they descended, their instruments suddenly detected a mysterious object hovering nearby, blocking their intended entryway. Tension filled the cabin as the crew realized the danger of the potential collision. NASA's explanation to the press, upon the crew's safe arrival, after a long delay, was that this large object was simply a piece of plastic. [lively music] - But a piece of plastic very much like this that's used to install tiles, was there before, is most likely what we saw in that camera view floating away. - So this Tehran pilot that almost crashed his F-4 back in the 70s in Tehran. That was an incident their government should care about it. So these interactions off the east coast with the flight crews from the USS Teddy Roosevelt. They almost crashed into a UAP that flew between them and missed their wingtips by 50 feet. So what he called an energy sphere, a cube inside of an energy looking sphere. And it passed within 50 feet between Graves and his wing man, and that is a safety to flight hazard. They are being exhibiting hazardous behavior. It's their job to determine what these things are and whether or not they are actually a threat, that is the job of the defense department and the intelligence community. Is to analyze and assess whether or not these things are a threat. - [Narrator] Seth Shostak is an American astronomer and author, currently serving as the senior astronomer for The SETI Institute. He appears to hold a belief that sets him apart from many in his field. Despite the vast amount of evidence and numerous eyewitness accounts surrounding UFOs, he remains convinced that the government has nothing to hide from the public regarding them. - I think that when it comes to suggestions that maybe the government is covering up, that's a very popular idea in the United States. I've lived in Europe, it's not such a popular idea there people don't figure that their government is covering up important info. But clearly in the US, if it's defense related there may be secrecy. People ask me all the time about Area 51. Well, Area 51 is a test range for new military aircraft. And of course, you're going to keep that secret if you can, otherwise, you get pictures of your latest fighter and going to the enemy. So, there's always some secrecy in government, but it isn't secrecy that pertains to science. Never, I've never come across that and I was supported by NASA actually in grad school, and you read on the web about how NASA's covering up again, as if NASA's made up of people who are conspiracy-minded, "We've got to keep this in the." Well in the United States space exploration is divorce from military uses of space, right? NASA is not building equipment to spy on other countries. The Defense Department does that, they do with their own satellites? So NASA is just, it's all about research. And it's all public. I mean you paid for it, the taxpayer. So it's all eventually available to you. You want to use the Hubble Space Telescope, sure, you can, you can because your dollars paid for it and that's just the way the federal government works. I worked, I mean, I had a top secret clearance when I was working for the Office and Naval Research, actually, and what they were doing there, well, yeah, it was secret but it wasn't malevolent in any sense. The idea was how do we protect our pilots, Navy pilots coming in for landings on aircraft, and stuff, on flat tops. - [Narrator] People have heard of SETI, and they know that SETI he has not produced any results in terms of actually confirming we're not alone in the universe. But what if there was civilian scientists out there that take this question and actually probe space with their own conventional technology. To find out the answer this question, I traveled to meet a friend, Jimmy Blanchette, in the middle of the desert, where he had set up his own radio telescope array designed to send out messages in hopes for an intelligent response coming from extraterrestrials locally. - I set up for the Moonbounce Communication. - [Darcy] Very cool, very cool. So you've been sending messages through radio telescope that you've built in your own backyard. And those messages reach the moon and you've been getting replies. - Yeah, that's right, exactly. Through different interactions which are literally define a lot of physics, from my experience all the test that I've done. And also not only replies through radios but also sightings, right? So there's been a lot of sightings that were produced as a result of this transmission, I can show you the antenna, let me show you the antenna. So see this one has 208, has limited 39 degrees elevation so I can turn the antenna direction, and you can see them outside. - It's like a canon, radio frequency canon. [suspenseful music] You see here, that it is now directed towards sun right now. And it's like a laser beam, you determine direction, so the broadcast in the direction of the target. And so we're going to make a transmission towards the sun right now. Using about a quarter of a million watts of power. And that's how I've been doing the work for the last few years really. And you'll see some cameras also that are set up here to record the action in the sky. They are covered with a material to prevent the radiation from affecting them, right? Faraday bag if you will, it's a faraday material to keep the camera from being damaged by the intense radiation that comes out of it, but I do have many recordings of sightings and manifestations taking place in the sky. - UFOs. - Yeah, yeah. Doing transmissions, and what we find is that these interactions contains information that's been why demonstrated that in the several of my latest presentations, but the sightings are pretty amazing and cannot be explained by conventional means and I have many of them, have hours of material of that. [lively music] [lively music continues] [lively music continues] [lively music continues] So towards the sun now, so we can go back inside and make a transmission and see. - If the sun replies. - Well, the sun does not reply but there's sometimes they are sightings during daytime as well. - Really, okay. And we've got some wolves that have come to say hi. - Yeah. - Were these wolves? Hey guys, one shot of the camera. - The different planets might get Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, we're gonna target Jupiter right now. It's 243.7 degrees 36 elevation, 244 degrees actually, hasn't it? I'm gonna. - [Darcy] What message are we picking here? - We'll pick a general message, a greeting message, gratitude messages of gratitude, and message to invite this civilizations to help us out. 243 so that's about here. There we go. And you see here, the antenna moving. - [Darcy] I'll go check it out real quick. [ducks quacking] - I can move it back if you want. - No, it's fine. [ducks quacking] [antenna vibrating] [antenna vibrating continues] [antenna vibrating continues] [lively music] This big antenna sits over top of our head and you've been using it some form of this antenna for many years now, right? - Yes. - When did you get into this? - Well, I started, I have been an amateur radio operator since childhood for many, many years. One of my passion was to build antennas, so fast forward, I've done essentially, or practice this hobby for many years until 2013 when I heard about a modality called Moonbounce Communication. And I had never heard about it before and that modality consists in literally using huge International System with a lot of power to bounce radio wave of the surface of the moon. And use the moon as a passive reflector essentially to establish contact here on earth. I said, this is a great challenge. So I wanted to, technically, I love technical stuff. So I wanted to get into it. So I started building my own antenna system and getting the whole equipment that was needed to do this. I did that, and I built an antenna, and a radio station. And in 2013, I had my first contact with essentially via Moonbounce Communication. So from there, I kept improving the system and kept building bigger, and bigger antenna with more power, up until 2016 when I got a myriad of three antennas that was pretty big. It was very unique and it's not this one, but it was using some of the same antenna system. And I wrote articles about it, scientific article about the system which was published in a magazine in Europe. It was a unique triangular configuration of antenna system. And so I kept going doing Moonbounce, but then I had a really powerful radio station by then. So 2017 I fast forward, I heard about what people call C5 or human initiated contact and I was always felt attracted by. - Which involves meditation? - Which involves meditation of different modalities really, but a lot of it is about meditation and people use consciousness to connect with civilizations. But there's also, some people use also small radios and there's some technology that's out there. Anyway, I had seen many, or watch some videos on the internet about people making contact and it was pretty impressive. So I was intrigued, since I had all this large equipment, this radio station. I said, "Why not using this radio station to send a message out there, to try to make contact?" And so that's what I did, I created my own very cool message, yes. - With this? Yeah. - You getting radio chatter there because you sent a message earlier and it. - Yes, before we had this, minutes ago Darcy and I, we broadcasted the message towards the sun using a quarter of a million watts, with a message. And so, we'll talk about it in a minute. But yeah, there's often interaction charters that comes back. [radios vibrating] [radios vibrating continues] [radios vibrating continues] - What you're doing, how does that differ from what SETI does, for example? - From what I know from SETI, not an expert with SETI, what I know is that they owe more in the receiving mode, they have giant radio telescopes or dishes, if you will. And the reason, by the way, why I'm not using these kind of satellite dishes the dishes right, the parabolic dishes, it's all about frequencies. When you go in the gigahertz, in a frequency gigahertz, it's more desirable to have this parabolic dishes. When you go and lower frequencies, then you use these kind of we call Yagi-Uda, directional Yagi antennas. But they all more in a receiving mode, form what I understand, so they pick the target, and they listen, and they look for an intelligent reply, or intelligence response, or something that- - Light years away. - Light years away. What I'm doing is different. I am actually broadcasting messages of various kind, where I'm inviting the intelligence to manifest their presence. And essentially, and I'm targeting planets in our solar system, targeting the sun, targeting the moon. And from, I mean, the evidence is overwhelming now that there's a presence out there that's been interacting with humanity. And now it's even the government admits that you look at the TikTok video and Nimitz, right? I mean, they're all here, they're not very far, right? And so the power I have here is more than enough to cover the solar system, and far beyond, but certainly the intelligence out there, they're gonna pick up that signal. So they're here, they're not very far. We don't need to have large equipment, very powerful equipment to reach them. Even a simple and handheld radio like this. I mean, if you look just a satellite at all, around the earth, they broadcast with milliwatts of power, fractions of watts. - To deliver you TV. - Deliver TV, and communication, and GPS, and all that in the fractions of watts. Even a handheld radio with 4 to 8 watts like this, the signal will go far beyond the International Space Station will actually reach the moon and I can demonstrate that technically. So they are here, we don't need a lot of equipment, it doesn't take a lot for humans to get their voice heard in space. - Do you have any suspicions that maybe some of these messages might be human that are coming back to you, like people that are just messing with you at all, or something like that? - Well, I want to mention here that in 2017 after I started this work, I shared this work with other experiencers. And so this contact modality if we want to call it this way, has been now utilized worldwide by dozens of people. People were doing contact work, and they've had all the very successful experiences, and they've shared their footage with me of sightings in the sky and directions for the radios. And so these, again, these interactions that are happening now after our broadcaster with the sun. And so it's not only me now, it's been done now by many other folks who were using this contact modality worldwide. So if somebody is messing with me, well, they're messing with people in Australia too, and New Zealand, right? It's it's all over the place. And again, I have done many tests, technical tests to demonstrate that these interactions, or if we look at the radio as well, it's a different type of interaction. It's not regular radio waves that they're sending back away. It's some other form of energy. - You said you put a radio inside of a microwave, which is a perfect Faraday cage. - Yes, that's right. So, if we have let's say, and I have videos of that, you put three radios for instance, set to the same frequency, one next to which are identical radios, like we have here. And the intelligence would be able to trigger only one of them, and typically they will trigger the one that you've used to transmit the message, which is impossible because if it will be a regular radio waves all the radios should be going off at the same time, right? If you on a FM radio - On that channel. - On that channel, yeah. Again putting the radios in Faraday cage, the interactions still happens. So putting the radio in a faraday cage. This is a microwave. And the interaction is still ongoing. Despite the fact that the radio is contained in a faraday cage which does not let any radio waves going in or out. Even though it's contained in these cage, or not letting radio wave in or out. So there are many signs like that, that it's not natural, and that's beyond all of technology that we can't really explain, but it's clearly there. And these interactions, if we get on the radio also, or often combined with sightings in the sky, amazing sightings in the sky. So that's all experience really that, and while I advice people who are interested, serious people, is to just go try it. It's available to anyone, it's not unique to me or a few other experiences. It's available to anyone. I believe, truly believe it's part of the great awakening. It's happening, if awakening of what's out there, and what's possible to do. Clearly I'm convinced they know way, way, way, way more than what they tell us. - NASA. - NASA, yeah. They know way more. I tend to try not even to get too much into this politics of what these things, clearly they've known this for decades, government knows this, NASA knows this and the public has been driven in the wrong direction and to look in the wrong direction on this. Again, just what I mentioned earlier is very simple, a simple principle that a few watts of power will go very far in space, far deeper than the International Space Stations. Meaning that we can get our voice heard in space easily. I don't think people know that. - [Darcy] There are many competing theories in regards to what is happening lately within Congress legally, to address UAP or UFO phenomenon in our skies. One person comes to mind, above others, that can decipher laws and actions in Congress regarding this issue. So in my quest to uncover the truth, I embarked on a mystical journey to the land of crystals and alternative health remedies, to find my friend Steven Bassett, a political activist and official lobbyist on Capitol Hill for disclosure, calling for the end of the truth embargo. [lively music] - We've seen an explosion of media coverage, I've logged in over 5000 articles for mainstream media, scores, and scores of briefings were conducted on private of members of Congress orchestrated by Christopher Melon, bringing witnesses up, and allowing some of the members to talk to them and getting them up to speed as it were, all right? This went on for probably two years. And the result of that, meaning these members of key committees like the Intel committees, The Armed Services committees, was that they became comfortable with the idea of let's do some legislation. And the first legislation which was initiated in 2021, past in 2022, in the National Defense Authorization Act 2022 was put in by Senator Warner. That legislation was very significant. It's set up some initial things over at the DOD, ask for certain things to happen, people were a little skeptical, but nevertheless, it was a major milestone. You had an enormous amount of press coverage of that. And then the House stepped in, you had Ruben Gallego put some language in the next bill, Andre Carson called for a hearing for the DOD to come forward, at least tell what's going on. It was very basic, but the first hearing since 1968. I think more private briefings took place and resulting in a new round of legislation, which was put in the 2023 Bill House Senate. And we watched that evolve, we watched the two Bills working through the House in the Senate, was extraordinary language, wondering how it would come out, ultimately was reconciled and that Bill was passed on December 23. As far as I'm concerned that Bill, which you can easily find online, it's the FY23 NDAA Bill. I think it's Bill number 7776, the language in it, which you can easily find by word searching unidentified, is astounding. There's a cross agency committee being created as instructed by the legislation in the Department of Defense across 16 or 17 different entities. Cross agency meaning there will be people assigned to this across these agencies, not their full-time job, they have a job, but then this will be part of their duties. That's how you bring lots of people together across agency. It could end up with several thousand people involved. Here are some of the most extraordinary things in the Bill, one of the most extraordinary is that this legislation calls for the now finally named office, or this program. It is the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, which is not bad, but then acronym AARO, that's good. The other ones they came up with were ridiculous. And so AARO, all right, that's set up. We know that recently several of the key witnesses some of the most important witnesses we will see testify before the Senate Intel committee, by that I mean the nuclear weapons tampering witnesses. These are fact-base command captains who were present when craft came down, hovered over the base, turned off the weapons, this happened many times. Something that The Pentagon and the president stayed away from, they can't undermine it, so they just ignore it. But now they're getting attention. They have been contacted to come in and be interviewed by AARO. Why is this important? The only reason you interview witnesses like that is to prepare them for Congressional briefing. One of the things that's really significant in this legislation, again, this is unprecedented stuff, nothing like it even remotely has happened, is requiring that all of the entities that could have intersected with this issue, right? Which is basically all the entities in the cross agency committee. Need to supply copies of all the non-disclosure agreements that are in their files relating to this issue. If somebody was put under a non-disclosure agreement either current or expired, they want to copy of that agreement to be sent to AARO. So what does that mean? It means they're going to get a huge amount of information about things that were people were asked to go under non-disclosure, not all of these non-disclosure agreements are specific but a lot of them are, and they also find out who was asked to be under non-disclosure. Now, this is to AARO, it's still classified in a sense, it's not to the public. But the Bill also states that once AARO has these non-disclosure agreements, or as they get them, and there's a lot of them, they will provide them to the appropriate congressional committees. Now they have them, this is extraordinary, as the congressional committees try to decide how to move forward with hearings. In other words, everything is going exactly as you would expect if we're heading for hearings and that's an extraordinary thing. Another extraordinary thing that they put in this Bill, which just blew my mind. And then it goes on to say, okay, but if it is authorized meaning it doesn't violate that, and so you're preventing authorized information, could be to your commander, it could be a member of Congress, whoever within the government, within the program. And anyone in Congress, or in your department, or agency, or a boss, or anybody else, pushes back with any kind of retribution, or threats, or anything else, classic example is you say anything more about that commander and you'll lose your flight privileges. That is no longer permitted. It is- - The threat is off the table. - Essentially, that's what they're saying, Okay? And what that does, why are they doing it, by the way, they're only referring to statements that are going to be internal, not to the media, or to whatever. No, no, you can't do that anyway, at least not now, but internally, they're freeing up the communication lines to make it easier for witnesses not whistle blowers, that's not what they are, and some people disagree, to come forward, say, "Okay, look I know about this, I know about that, I understand that you're gathering this information and I like to provide this, okay?" They're freeing it up, why? Because if you're going to have really important hearings you can't have a very significant witness unless you know who they are, unless they come forward, they're never going to be in the committee. So that's preparation for hearings. Other members of the United States Senate and House are learning that this information is being collected by these other members, and they would like to know. And what one way or another, they're getting bits and pieces, and they're realizing, "Oh wow." And they're thinking, "I'm a member of Congress, I like to be able to speak to this, I'm not getting briefed." And so what they're doing is on their own they're coming forward and getting into the issue. And there's been several of these, but the one that intrigues me the most is Tim Burchett who has some committee assignments, they're not insignificant, but they're not the ones that are getting briefed, I think by the DOD. And so he has taking on himself to come forward in multiple venues, including on Fox News, saying matter of fact there's extra-terrestrials here. These are non-human craft, that wasn't happening before. And recently another member of Congress did that. Well, this is going to continue. To the members that have come forward, or put legislation out like Rubio, Warren, Diego, Carson, Gillibrand, Mike Gallagher who spoke up at the hearing. To my knowledge and I'm paying close attention, not a single one of these politicians is taking any blow back, no political loss at all. In other words, people are going "Great, wow, that's cool." One of the reasons is this is a truly non-partisan issue. The United States government, in both Congressional areas, as well as the Department of Defense, as well as the military services, as well as defense contractors, there're people in all of those entities with need to know, and their predecessors, okay, that have known about the extraterrestrial presence since at least 1947 and perhaps 1945, they've known. It's not the government is just learning, "Oh, there's something there, we should do something." Oh, no, no, they've known all along. All right, okay fine, that doesn't mean everybody, no. But is the government, yeah absolutely. Enough people that it's clearly being dealt with and they understand it. - [Darcy] And NASA is really well connected too. - Oh and NASA too. Oh, absolutely NASA. There are people in NASA all along, certainly at the highest level like the administrator were like, "No, the ET presence is real." Okay, but there's a truth embargo as I've stated million times, and that embargo says that this is not going to be confirmed to the American people. Okay, so now they have been gaming this outcome for years. The Pentagon has supercomputers that manage other supercomputers. They game everything, everybody knows this, right? War games all that stuff. And so they have been predicting and gaming how this could work. That's a very complex thing, all right? And I happen to know that in early 1990s The Pentagon submitted a substantial contract to a major public relations firm in Washington called Hill + Knowlton, and it was, your public relations firm, we want you to analyze all of the public relations aspects of how we can get to telling and confirming to the people the ET presence disclosure. Then we want you to also look and analyze the public relations issues we face after we've confirmed the ET presence. And they got this report back in a number of years, cost millions of dollars. They've been sitting on us of 20 years, that's just that. So it's not like they're just suddenly shocked here, okay? And the outcome of that is this, what they're doing is going through an appropriate, relatively transparent process leading to disclosure that involves the proper entities, the Congress the DOD, legislation, and all the things they should have done in all those previous opportunities to correct the record, to finally end this embargo. Not to start investigating the issue, they've never stopped investigating the issue. And you might say, "Well, why don't they just admit it?" Just come out and say, "We've known all along." Because look, this is a big deal. It has implications for everybody, the politicians, the DOD agencies, and everything else. If it's not done in an orderly fashion, if it doesn't allow participation of many institutions and the public, it's going to be that much more unpleasant, it's going to be more destructive. We need to do this with as many winners as possible, and not too many losers. And so this is what I call a public relations driven extrication process in which the government in an orderly fashion, to good purpose, is lying its way out of the bigger lie to service a larger purpose. You would ask about NASA. And again when I say this process is a public relations driven extrication program. Oh boy, do I include NASA in there. In other words, it's the entire government, this interface with this issue, is extricating itself and correcting the record, which includes NASA. NASA under the 1958 space act, absolutely not touch this issue. All right, let me put it this way, it can find a whole frigging civilization on the back side of the moon, and the first thing it could do under the act was notify the Department of Defense. "Look what we just found." And the Department of Defense is going to say, "Fine, ever talk about this, everybody's fired." And so NASA this whole time, - Is classified. - Is yeah, absolutely. Whether you find it or not. And so NASA is trying to explore space and be the civilian space agency, while at the same time knowing that there's a extraterrestrial presence. It could be confirmed, and their budget could be increased tenfold. And they're a scientific base operations, so they're having to violate certain fundamental principles in service of national security. So all the various entities that what I would call, the biggest state of cognizant distance on this issue would be NASA. It has suffered because of this and so nevertheless it is gone along with the embargo. So as part of the public relations thing, it's not surprising that NASA is being allowed to get up to speed, to get with the ball game so when things break people would go, "Oh, you're doing the right thing." So what did the government do? What was the plans? Well, they said we know it's coming. Yeah, we're about to get going here. We need a new NASA administrator. Why don't we pick a former Senate member of the Senate Intel Committee who just happens to be an astronaut and make him the administrator, right? Perfect guy, Nelson. And then it's like, "Well, I think NASA should make some interesting statements, he did, confirming, look, there's something here and so forth. Oh, by the way, NASA should start up a research group, or what have you, it's doing the appropriate thing. - [Narrator] STS-48. STS 48 marked an important mission in terms of UFO rumors in space. On the third day of the mission, the primary payload, the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, UARS was deployed. This 14,500-pound observatory was set to conduct the most extensive study ever conducted of earth's troposphere, the upper level of the planet's envelope of life-sustaining gases, which includes the protective ozone layer. [lively music] During the UARS mission, a flash of light was observed by the UV space camera, followed by the sudden appearance of two missile-like objects heading towards mysterious objects on the horizon. [lively music] These objects seemed to stop and make evasive maneuvers, marking a significant moment in UFO space history. After this incident, some claim that NASA began routinely obscuring space video, cutting video feeds, and using code words to conceal UFO activity. - Be right below it, hard to see is the surface of the earth. This is the earth down here. This is above the atmosphere. That's a star. This is the second object that is of interest to us. And it's slowly coming up as you can see. And in a little bit you're going to see the main object pop up here, go over, and you'll see some flashes down here and then it's going to sharply cut back here. [lively music] Against later a streak is going to go through there right where it go, and there goes the streak. And there's a second streak right there, hard to see. You can't tell by watching the video but the main object actually paused for half a second before it turned back up the other direction. - If we take a look at this STS-48 video, in which it seems as though we might be firing missiles at a UFO that stops in space above earth. This is kind of worrying. If the theory is correct, Dr. Jack Kasher wrote a physics paper on, then that means that we are firing on other civilizations. But what if this craft is actually a black budget military craft from earth? Either from a project that is very quietly being run, privately, that the military doesn't know about, or by an enemy nation. Has a faction of the human race been able to create UFOs that operate in a way that we would consider unearthly? That is the greater question here. But firing at something that's in space like this is also worrying because it might mean that we're at war secretly in space. And with the backdrop of the Space Force being created recently, as well as this war going on in Ukraine between Russia and the West, and soon possibly China. One has to wonder if this escalation in war might spill over into the theater of space, and if we might see more of this dramatic UAP or UFO type activity going on out there. One thinks of the 2023 UAPs and balloons that recently were shot down. - My name is Alara and I'm an experiencer. I produced a space in defense news show for a number of years which allowed me to become very familiar with the Space Force in its initial development and disclosure to the greater population at large. I think when people initially heard the term Space Force, they were thinking space lasers and spacecrafts, something more akin to "Star Wars". And although there is some element of truth to this especial moving into the future, this image of our sixth and newest branch in the military is not entirely accurate. Space Force is mainly tasked with intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, operating and defending military satellites and their associated ground stations that provide global communications, navigation, and earth observation. They're also in charge of missile detection and defense. You will hear the term architecture in relation to the Space Force this encompasses the entire network of military satellites and their supporting components. Also including secure data transmission and analysis. This is largely what the Space Force actually does at this time. The future of Space Force, however, will heavily rely on machine learning and artificial intelligence. AI will be tasking sensors and then pruning the info which will be sent to analysts augmenting each operators decision to act, and in which direction. Sensors and algorithms will essentially make calculations enabling swarm intelligence to then execute. Programs such as RS21 and it's prediction of satellite failures will become the standard, as will distributed computing and trajectory design. Orbital swarms will create structures and flying formation, unthinkable amounts of data analyzed, and trajectories calculated on the fly. Now NASA is a little bit different from Space Force, in that it is our Civil Space Program. They're stated purpose is to explore, discover, and expand knowledge for the benefit of all of humanity into the far reaches of our solar system and beyond. Things like NASA's Sensor Web and Hubble demonstrate this. As where Space Force is mainly tasked with detection, prediction, and the defense of mother earth herself. All operations at this juncture are pretty much limited to LEO. However, Space Force will be coordinating with NASA in multiple areas. One example of this would be Artemis 1 where things such as space debris detection become not only necessary, but critical, in a congested space landscape. Space Force ability to coordinate space related efforts between all branches of the military will be vital in order to enable such missions moving forward. The nature of war is changing, and governments around the world have acknowledged that space and cyberspace are the new war fighting domains, making the role of Space Force integral in coordinating the technological efforts on this front. - I understand the Space Force, US Space Force, we have now fifth branch of the military. It wasn't a new idea? I mean, that was I mean, if you read, delve into it, Google it, delve into it, this idea was thought of back in the 1980s. Reagan, Weinberger, many government officials, even a CIA, even Richard Helms, he was the Director of the CIA back in the 70s, they had a proposal that we have to, classified, have to protect space. Now, the proposal meant more or less that we had protect space from Chinese or Soviets from attacking us. And so the proposal for a Space Force was in the 80s, the Department of Defense planned it, wrote out policies about it, but it never went very far. - Publicly. - Publicly. The Proposal went to to President Clinton in the 90s. '95, 1995 he was briefed on it, and and they wanted to push this through in one of the defense bills. He said, no he didn't really want to do it. Again in '81. In 2001 under George Bush it was pushed through, and I didn't want to do it either. And then finally when Trump came in office, they brought this proposal to him, and he said, "Yes sure, let's do it." And that's why we have the US Space Force now. Now, I think it's too pronged, one being that they do want to counter anything that the Russians put up, or the Chinese, right? And the second prong to that is we want to be protected by, we know there are hostile alien forces out there, we know it. And we want to be prepared for that. - I believe the answer is, they already know these things are a threat to some extent, and it is not understandable to me that they have not adapted filters, or turned off filters to try to find some of these. And I'll give you an example. In ASAP, which was the first program run to do UAPs funded by Senator Reed and some of his peers in the Senate. One of the defense intelligence research directives the DERBS that came out, was a section covering experiencers. And this government classified document, which is now released to the public, spoke to women being impregnated in these experiences where they are abducted, and we don't know all of the data that went into that claim, but that's just in a classified government document. So that speaks to a threat to the public in the United States of America that someone in the government should care about. And that's number one, number two, we have ongoing incursions of UAP, whatever they might be, in and around our defense installations and our equipment onboard nuclear installations, our missile bases, our aircraft carriers, and interacting with our airplanes. So, and in some cases causing a hazard to flight safety by some of these pilots. So this to me speaks to something we should investigate. And it is clear from the National Defense Authorization Act, and the budget bill that was passed to fund these activities that Congress believes there is an issue that we need to investigate. And for whatever reason, the defense department intelligence community have decided to not look into this. Congress is having no part of it, they are determined to get some answers about what is going on. And these all staff reports and the current ongoing reports of activity speak to the need to get serious about figuring out what these things are about. Why are they here, what are they doing, how do they do what they do? [lively music] [lively music continues] - [Pilot] Okay, dude. There's a whole fleet of them I'm seeing. My God. They go against the wind, when it's a hundred twenty thousand. Look at this thing. [lively music] [lively music continues] [lively music continues] [lively music continues] [lively music continues] [lively music continues] [lively music continues]
