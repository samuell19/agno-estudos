INORI "On the boat of Yagiri "We must hide away "We want to live "Our love..." HERE LIES SHIZU SAWATARI DECEASED AT 83 YEARS OLD What happens after? We go to heaven. I'd like to go to heaven and live in peace with everyone. I'd like to see more life around here. There's not much left. My father and mother lie were laid to rest here. When I think about it, there's nowhere else I can go. It's not like it was before, not at all. There was so much activity before. Now it is very quiet. Back then, there were plenty of children. From morning to night, we would hear them play. Now, there's nothing. It's really sad. Three generations used to live under the same roof. When I was young, it was like that. There were my in-laws, us and our children. Six or seven people lived in the house. That kind of family is a thing of the past. My grandchildren live in Tokyo and won't come back here. There is no work here. There are almost no young people here. If there was work, my grandchildren would return, but there is nothing here. The work has disappeared. There's nobody. Fields have dried up. No one tends to them. It makes me sad to think about it. Soon, one day or aother, we will pass into what lies beyond. These vegetables were given to me. Let's not cook them too long. I must not overcook them. That's it! They're done. Damn... I overcooked them. It's okay. You see? It's a bit overcooked. With no broth, this isnâ€™t so good. Broth makes it nice. I tie them together. I tie them together like this. I peel them after they're done cooking. I'll put them in water. I'll let them soak until tomorrow. They'll be ready tomorrow. Like this... There we go! I'm going now. I don't want my clothes soaked by the rain. I use this for clothing. To cook my vegetables, I need to buy broth. My husband really is a good man. Truly... Almost too good for me. When I ask him to do things for me, sometimes he gets angry, but it's rare that this happens. Also, our health isn't great. I wouldn't have the strength to live alone. If I were in better shape, perhaps we could leave here. Hello. How are you? It's Ms. Fukui here... Sakae Fukui. I'm a patient from Uenoji hospital. Is the clinic open this afternoon? Is the clinic open? Is it open? I called several times earlier... there was no answer. I thought you might want to know that was happening. What? Yes. Really? Is it open or not? Very good. Thank you. I'm taking this cane with me. How old was your husband when he died? He was 87. He was that old? How long ago did he die? It's been almost two years... Hmm... You must be sad, after a whole life together. He was sick for a long time. First he was hospitalized in Yagi, then for a year in Gojo. Hmm... And since his death, you live alone? A neighbor, perhaps? In your village at least? Hmm... And your children? My third son lives in Uenoji. He teaches at the Hiradani School. He married a girl from Gojo and they bought a house near the school. - His wife is...? - My second son lives in Osaka. He works, but I don't know where. What? You don't know what he does for a living? No. - If he died, I would know. - Of course. When his father died, he didn't come. He didn't come? We wondered if he was dead. He should have come. Of course. Did you try to contact him? Yes, but I don't know where he is. He must work somewhere. And your eldest son, where is he? He lives in Gojo. Your eldest is in Gojo and the second... You know Gojo Station? He lives next door. But he's never home during the day. He works. And where does your fourth child live? What? My fourth boy? You only have boys? No, I have a daughter. She lives in Oto. You know the Oto baths? Yes, I do. Her house is near them, somewhere in Oto. - Hmm... - Yes. - Does she visit you sometimes? - Yes. Only your second son doesn't visit? Yes, he's the only one. You must worry. I just want him to tell me, "I'm fine, mom." I worry about him. Will the school reopen? - No, I don't think so. - Really? If there were more children, maybe. - The nursery, too? - No, sadly. On the first floor, there were classrooms, weren't there? Weren't there tables? Were they taken away? - Yes, they were removed. - Really? What a pity... Sometimes we used those rooms to meet. Only the elderly would come. Only residents of Kannogawa. - Did that hurt? - It's fine. I passed through to the beyond. And I almost stayed there. In 1968, I was gravely injured. I almost reached the other side. I have witnessed that world. You saw beautiful flowers, right? There were beautiful flowers. - It was the afterlife. - Between two worlds, there is a river that must not be crossed. Do not pass that river-- stay on this side. At that time in my life, I had to stay alive... to be able to help others. - You've been very helpful! - That was the message I received. I had to help others. My wife doesn't get back until late at night. How beautiful... I'm just waking up. Are you going to see the chickens? The tea isn't finished brewing. I must begin praying, and the tea is not finished. The tea is not fully brewed, I'll put the kettle on. I'll be right back after prayers. The water is too clear. It is too clear. May I suffer no longer... Please protect me. Thank you. I just prayed. The day never begins without prayer. It's hot. This is rice porridge. I have some soy. Wait. I'll get the soy. To make rice in the morning, I have to get up early. Don't touch that, those are my drugs. I feel no pain now, but it was bad earlier. I had skin inflammation from wearing a cast. I had inflammation from that. What time is it? I have to go buy food this afternoon. What time is it? What time is it? It's 6:00. Hmm... I'm missing teeth. I can't eat soy. Here it is... they don't sell it here. But it's sold over there, right? Over there... in Hiradani. Marinated vegetables... We, the people who live here... all we eat is rice porridge. In the morning, I can't eat much. I'm going to heat up some water. It was on June 16th... Or was it the 15th? I forgot. It was a cloudy day. My mother watched the begonias. She also watched children. She said, "these flowers are so beautiful..." She was always moved by them. After 30 minutes, I would put her in bed. When she wanted to watch flowers, I took her into the room overlooking the garage roof. That was where they bloomed. It was her great pleasure. She died of old age. She worked too hard. When she died, it was very hard. In fact... when I was young, I caused her a lot of stress. Is she back yet? I was feeling bad before the meal. - But I took my medicine. - I'll put some cream on you. I took painkillers. After I came here yesterday... I didn't feel well. That's why I took them. No painkillers, that was the problem. I wasn't feeling well. The nurse wasn't here. She had gone to Ohara. Her replacement came from Owara. Her name is Makiguchi. The doctor was there. Where did the doctor go? I don't know. He's a good doctor. Ask for him next time. - Hello. - Hello. The doctor comes every day. No problem, you should come. - Can I? - You're welcome to. I brought you sponge cakes. Thank you very much. - I'll take these electrodes off. - Okay. I'll take them off. That didn't last too long. No, just 15 or 20 minutes. I have to go home, Mr. Okada is coming. No, it's Mr. Mochizuki. The electrician is coming at 11:00. At 9:00 or 10:00, I have to run errands in Okawa. I will apply the cream. Relax. Like the doctor at Uenoji said, I can't lift heavy objects anymore, even if I don't feel pain. I don't want to be hospitalized again. He wants me to go back to see him. I think it's a good idea to have a consultation now and then. Yes, I should be careful. The doctor told me to be careful about my health. Hello! Here you go. It's cold outside. I'm going home. Thank you very much. I'm not in very good shape. The "nebuka," it's good. - Kinuko gave me nebuka. - The "nebuka"? What is "nebuka"? - What? - What is nebuka? This is it. - Leeks? - Yes. I'm going home. It was more of a bar than a restaurant. My mother was a great cook and there were many customers. Her specialty was Chinese cuisine. She would make dumplings. The ones we bought were too thin, and they would break apart. That's why she made them herself. What can I do to straighten this out? This isn't working. This won't do. "Where are we going? "A place where no one knows us "The rain falls "On the boat of Yagiri "To escape from sad rumors "We take leave of Shimabata "We take leave to our new life "Abandoning everything behind us..." Divine spirits, protect us and bring us happiness. INORI subtitles by baaab
