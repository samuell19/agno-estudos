Well isn't that enough? No one has really photographed the Isles properly. Oh, what does Conan Doyle call it in his book, you know The Last World? - You don't remember Conan Doyle Jose? - [Juan] No. - It's. (speaking in Spanish) - There's no prehistoric monsters left there if that's what you want to photograph. - I don't know I might find one. - Diamonds are the monsters now. - Well I think that a man's gonna risk his life he may as well try to get rich doing it don't you? - [Terry] And that's why no proper pictures have been taken. - The lady is very stubborn. - Here's the gun you ordered Jim. - Oh gracias Juan. - Wait a minute, that's not for us is it? - Yes it is. - No we don't need that. - Ms. Greene, nobody goes into Los Janos without a gun. - We are not taking any guns. - We're taking this one. - Put that down right now. - You take care of your picture taking Ms. Greene I'll take care of the equipment. - I mean it damn you we're not taking any guns. (tense music) (calm music) (serene music) - We have about an hour. Why don't you and your bike, motorcycle, si? Drive me around Caracas. When the sun comes up, we see the sun. (motorcycle rumbling) - Morning Mr. Pendrake. - Well good morning. - Have you seen Art anywhere? - He's not with you? - I don't know where he is he's not in his room. - [Jim] Check the coffee shop? - Yeah he's not in there either. - Well I hope he shows up we have a long way to go today and we should be getting started. You'll be riding with me on my bike at least until we get out of the city. - No, I don't think so I think-- - We had our little dispute last night but we're gonna be spending a lot of time together the next couple of weeks I think we should learn to get along. How about we call a truce hmm? - Okay. - Good, now I'd like to try this knapsack on you. - Now what about this where should I put it? - Well we can strap that on the front here along with my knapsack.

It's all over, let's go. - [Terry] You did bring that gun! - Of course I brought it. - [Terry] I told you not to! - Terry probably saved your life with it. And my life! That was a good shot, thanks Jim. - Yeah I'd rather have heard the thanks coming from her for some reason. - Well she, I told you she doesn't understand the gun. It's a long story you wanna hear it? - No. (calm music) ♫ Tell me what you love ♫ And I'll tell you who you are ♫ You have to be a dreamer if your love ♫ Is very far ♫ Some love only money ♫ And some love only fun ♫ I love all things ♫ That love the sun ♫ If you have the thing you love ♫ Do you keep it for yourself ♫ Love it like it is or make it into something else ♫ Mine I can't control ♫ It belongs to everyone ♫ I love all things ♫ That love the sun ♫ I love all things ♫ That love the sun ♫ I've told you what I love ♫ Can you tell me who I am ♫ Would you say that I'm a prophet ♫ Or an ordinary man ♫ Is it something you've outgrown ♫ Or maybe never done ♫ Love all things ♫ That love the sun ♫ Love all things ♫ That love ♫ The sun (motorcycles rumbling) - I bet you thought we'd never make it. - I never did, never. - Turn around I'll help you with that pack. - Don't you believe in roads Jim? - There are no roads to this place my friend. You came over the highway. Well, welcome to Arto El Milagro. - What does that mean? - Well if you'll believe it it means the miracle. - I think it's a miracle we got here. - Jim. - Yeah. - What'd you say they cured this thing with? - [Jim] Wine Arthur, wine. - I thought you said they cured it with yarn I think there's still some left. (laughing) - Listen to me I wanna like freshen up or something is there-- - Yeah there are showers inside and I've arranged for hammocks to be strung out for the evening. - Fantastic that's what I'm gonna do right now. - You're a wonderful person Jim. - I am a wonderful person. - [Terry] Listen what are you gonna do? You gonna freshen up? - No, I want a nice cold beer. - We will drop you off at the bar on the way if you will follow your leader okay? - Come on let's go. - Hi. (speaking in Spanish) One beer. Thank you. That's good. Hi. Got a light? Thank you. - Hello. - Oh there you are. - Yes. - What took you so long? - [Terry] Oh well I don't know I just need a big fat drink. - Well I see you found the table and the chair anyway. - Okay I'm buying. Well, what are you having? - [Terry] Oh, whatever, surprise me. - One whatever, what are you having Jim? - [Jim] I'll have a double whatever. - Two whatevers. Okay, one beer, two scotches. (speaking in Spanish) Scotch. (speaking in Spanish) Scotch. (laughing) Hey can you help me out? - Hey look why don't you let me buy you and your friends a drink? - Hey you're on okay we'll drink what you're drinking forget the scotch. - Tres mas. - [Arthur] Hey thanks name's Arthur Greene. - Pleasure. - Why don't you come over and join us? - I'd like that very much. - [Arthur] Okay let's go. - One. - Surprise. This is my sister Terry, this is Jim Pendrake. And I didn't get your name. - Caribe. - Do we know each other? - No. - Well Mr. Caribe just bought us a round of drinks. - [Terry] How nice. - Pleasure. - [Arthur] Sit down Caribe. - Thank you. (tense music) - Do you live here Mr. Caribe? - [Caribe] Yes. - How long have you been here? - Caribe is one of South America's most renowned hunters. - [Terry] Oh really, what do you hunt? - Everything. (chuckling) And what are you doing here Ms. Greene? - I'm here on a grant. - What kind of grant? - Photography grant. - Hey Caribe, you know how to do the funky chicken? You don't. Okay. - But as a hunter, don't you feel the blood, don't you feel the terror the pain of the animal? Don't you care about the motherless offspring that won't be able to survive? - If man sees the blood, feels the pain and the suffering he's not a hunter. A hunter feels only the excitement. Chase, and victory. - [Terry] Why do you hunt? - Instinct. Better the predator than the prey. - Oh come on. - No I mean it. You see a long time ago at the dawn of man there were two great apes who are forefathers. It was the Austrelo Pithenes africanus Austrelo Pithenes robustus. Africanus was a wiry intelligent ape. He found if he took the femurs bone of an animal and he went around thumping his fellow animals that he not only had something to eat but he didn't have anybody messing with him. So man's aggressive tendencies and desires were established so long ago that they're instinct today. - You know it's funny but I heard that you didn't talk very much let alone in Latin. - I'm sorry, I must apologize for monopolizing the conversation. - No no. I wanna say that society is changing there are more and more people against violence and killing today. - That's right. But there are more and more people in the world today and we're still the only species that murders. - Sounds like a cop out to me. - Diamonds. So we wanna find a place where we can take some pictures of diamonds, take pictures. (speaking in Spanish) - [Caribe] Excuse me for a second please. - Hey Caribe how ya doing? - [Caribe] Fine. - Let me buy you a drink. - [Caribe] I still have one at the table thank you. What'd you wanna know about the diamond mines? - [Jim] Did you understand what the man at the bar asked Caribe to do? - Huh? No what? - Apparently your brother wants some information about the diamond mines. - Well you know him, he'll get his diamond one way or another. - Well he's getting his information from the man who knows believe me. - I'm sorry I must apologize for the interruption. - Did you ever ride a bike? - [Caribe] What? - A motorcycle, you know vroom vroom vroom a motorcycle. - Yeah I did, used to do it a lot when I was a kid. - Oh you did? Wanna race? (laughing) - No thanks a lot. - No come on now I'm serious, let's you and me have ourselves a motorcycle race huh? - I think you have me at a disadvantage. - I'm awfully tired and I think I'll just try to get some rest, so if you'll excuse me. - Miss I'm sure you're very tired. - Goodnight. - But at daybreak, jeffe, you and me are gonna have ourselves a motorcycle race like you ain't gonna believe. - Whatever's fair. - Pass the cantina by the south road. You got that? (motorcycles rumbling) - Go! - Oh, here hold this. - All right I bet on the gorilla. (gate squeaking) (motorcycle rumbling) (intense music) (gentle music) - Mucho gracias. (speaking in Spanish) Yeah he's a good guy. Caribe! (speaking in Spanish) Yeah good man. Big big man. Tough guy. (intense music) - Damn! (motorcycle rumbling) - [Arthur] Bravo bravo! How you doing amigo? - [Terry] Oh you're finished. - What have you guys been doing? Running underwater? - Would you believe it? (laughing) - Good race. - The best. - Hi. (laughing) - Hi. (laughing) - Who wants to go to the diamond mines? - [Arthur] Hey you just talked me into it. - Now? - Terry? - Well you wanna see diamonds don't ya? - No you wanna see diamonds so I'll take pictures. (laughing) - What do you say I meet you all out here in a half an hour? - Get our gear together, come on Terry. (speaking in Spanish) (laughing) (speaking in Spanish) (tense music) - Hey Miguel, adios amigo. - Adios. (calm music) (tense music) (camera snapping) (people chattering) (speaking in Spanish) - This area here mostly different diamond companies throughout the world send representatives and they set up little stands about the diamonds and the miners in the field. - I see. - [Jim] Now that man is checking the karat weight of the diamond. See he's using a handheld scale but it's very accurate. - Hey amigo. - [Man] Hmm? - Do you know where we can get some pictures of diamonds. - Oh sure you get that a lot of pictures of the diamonds all this land here diamond. But you have to find a shovel. - Can we see some? - Oh you wanna see some uncut? Yeah well I can ask. (speaking in Spanish) - What did you ask him? - [Jim] I asked him to show you some diamonds, take a look these are uncut. (speaking in Spanish) - How's it going? You know Caribe? - Oh sure Caribe is a bad guy. Hey how about look for diamonds like I do? I diamond digger. - [Arthur] Yeah? - I did, I dig diamonds, they are crazy. Yeah I always get the diamonds, always get the diamonds I was found in the book. - [Arthur] Does Caribe know where to get diamonds? - No Caribe don't know where to get the diamonds I know where to get the diamonds. Get a shovel, a bucket, and you go with me and you get the diamonds. You. - I'd like you to have this. - Oh no no no I couldn't take it. - Gracias. Hey Arturo, come on let's go. - Amigo. - [Man] All right. - Gracias. (calm music) (wildlife chattering) (shovel scraping) (footsteps tapping) (tense music) (water flowing) (uplifting music) (tense music) (calm music) (airplane rumbling) (wildlife chattering) (truck rumbling) (bird squawking) - Shh, you stay here. (birds squawking) (camera snapping) - Look at that. (gun firing) (intense music) (suspenseful music) (Caribe shouting) (Terry screaming) - Terry! Terry! - Put me down let me go! (Terry screaming) - Terry! - Oh will you stop it? Stop it let me go! - Terry! - All right what's going on? - Leave me alone you! - [Jim] Are you all right? - What are you doing just going around grabbing people like that what's wrong with you? - She was wading. - Wading? - Well what the hell's wrong with that? - Barefoot? - Yes barefoot I was just walking along and a thorn went through my shoe and I was trying to wash it off that's all. - Young lady you're lucky you didn't lose a foot. - [Terry] What do you mean? - Do you know that there are electric eels, and rays, and piranha in there? Yes in there. - In there? - [Jim] Isn't that right Caribe? - Exactly. (suspenseful music) I think we still have enough light to get you over the Indian village. Could get some pretty good pictures there what do you say? - Might have enough light to get there but we wouldn't have enough to get back to San Fernando. - That's right. Look why don't you have dinner at my place this evening and then spend the night at my quarters? - I don't think so. - But I think it's a damn good idea. Thanks a lot Caribe we'll take you up on it. - It'd certainly be my pleasure. (truck rumbling) (calm music) (dog barking) - Well there it is. - [Terry] Okay. - I tell you what if you don't mind I've seen this place so many times I think I'll just stay in the jeep. - I've been here before too so I'll wait with you okay? - Good enough. - Are they friendly? (laughing) - Come on sport you coming? - All right, give me this thing here. - It's my little gopher. Okay see you later. (calm music) (camera clicking) (suspenseful music) - [Jim] Change under it. (calm music) - [Arthur] I'd get your cameras ready sis. Little bit of paradise. - I'd like to thank you for this afternoon Mr. Caribe. - Not mister just Caribe. - That's a very unusual name how'd you get it? - The Indians gave it to me. - Really, what does it mean? - Piranha. - It's like those fish we saw this afternoon. Why would they call you that? - I think it's because of my table manners. - Maybe it's your appetite as well. - That's possible. We're all hunters in a way though aren't we? You with your camera and me with my gun. - I don't think so. I try to preserve life with my camera. Not destroy it as you do with your gun. - Cameras take pictures. Picture is an imitation. Don't have any feeling of life or death. - They don't harm anything though. - That's right. Because they're static, don't have any meaning or purpose. But there is a feeling and there is a love in the hunt. - You love killing and wounding? - I can taste the very soul of every animal I hunt. In mind. And what a soul those are. And what I have becomes a part of me. It lives on in me. Someday I'll be out hunted. Everything that I am will become part of that hunter. But the hunt always goes on. - What kind of bird is that? - King vulture. (camera snapping) Let me know when you're about to be shooting. - [Terry] Okay just one more shot. (camera snapping) (gun firing) - Terry! - I'm fine! You shot that bird for no reason! - Look I'm sorry Ms. Greene, but I have to go out after El Tigre early tomorrow and I have to use this weapon and I haven't used it before. And that vulture made a good test. One scavenger dies, many are fed. - So is your ego. (tense music) - She's got a problem. - Yeah she's got a problem. (lighter clicking) I'll listen now if you wanna talk about it. - Sure you have the time Jim? - I got the time all right. - Little family history all right? - All right. - I was away at the time, see, we had problems like all good families. My mother drank a little too much, our father he played around a little too much. One night, during one of these nice little family quarrels, our mother put a gun to my father's head and blew his brains out. Terry was there she saw the whole thing. She wakes up dreaming about it. Wakes up screaming. That's the problem Jim. - That explains a lot. - Does it? - Come on I'll buy you a refill huh? - No thanks. You go ahead I'll check you later all right? - Yeah okay. (calm music) (footsteps tapping) You like some coffee? - No thanks. - Some talk? (sighing) - No. - Is there anything I can do for you? - Okay, don't tell me you're concerned. - Well if there is anything I can do let me know will you? - I'll take the coffee. Thank you Jim. Look, what do you say we get outta here? - No. I don't wanna go. I'm not going to go. - Okay. You have your way of life, he has his. We're guests in his house. What do you say we just get the story and get outta here? - Okay. I'm gonna do a hell of a story. - And so the last time I saw this little cat that was a long time ago. She was in pretty bad shape this big anaconda wrapped himself around it and it was squeezing the life out of it. I like cats, and I don't like snakes. You wouldn't understand that. Well anyway I shot the anaconda. Jerked it off this little jaguar, she's in shock. I thought she was gonna die. - Sort of like pulling the thorn out of the lion's paw hmm? - Yeah sorta. Anyway we were sitting on the ground together all the sudden she starts to come to, she reaches up and takes a swipe at me. Gets me pretty good on the left side of the face. Just about like Terry did this afternoon. Anyway that's when I knew this little cat was gonna be all right. - What happened to the cat? - [Caribe] I'm hunting it tomorrow. - Oh Art that'll give you and me a chance to go out and see if we can find some diamonds hmm? Look behind you. (motor rumbling) Those are the Jaguai Indians. (calm music) - I like the way they dress. (laughing) - That's the modern topless I guess this is where it all began. (suspenseful music) (camera snapping) (wind blowing) What's on your mind? Something's bugging you. - Yeah, lot of things bugging me. What's peligro mean? - Peligro? - Peligro I don't know what does it mean? - Where'd you pick that up? - Doesn't matter. - Well the word means danger. What is it? - What do you say Jim? Would it burn you if we had to get outta here? Turn the boat around, go back? (suspenseful music) (intense music) (Terry groaning) (Terry screaming) (rain pouring) (footsteps tapping) Pack our bags and get outta here. Terry, pack and go. - [Jim And Arthur] Terry. - Terry. Terry! Terry. Terry! Terry. Hey come on. Let's get outta here. Terry? Hey. You all right? Terry. Hey. You all right? You stay with her Jim. (footsteps tapping) - Don't let him go, please. (footsteps tapping) - Caribe! (monkeys chattering) Caribe! Caribe! (water splashing) Caribe! Caribe! Caribe! (monkey screeching) Caribe! Caribe! - [Caribe] You lookin' for me? (grunting) (intense music) (water splashing) (water thrashing) - Will you be all right? All right I'll try to catch up with him. (intense music) - Where's Art? - He's dead and gone and we've gotta get out of here now. Caribe killed him and we've got to leave killed, now let's go! Terry! Now. (motor rumbling) (suspenseful music) - Pendrake! Come on out! - Come on! Get in! No key, look I'm gonna have to hot wire this keep an eye out. (dog barking) (suspenseful music) (people cheering) - Pendrake! Leave the girl! (gun firing) Come on out Pendrake! Pendrake! I know you're in there! Now leave the girl and come on out! (fire crackling) (laughing maniacally) - [Jim] We're trapped. (people screaming) (Caribe laughing maniacally) (fire roaring) (dog barking) (gun firing) (Caribe shouting) (laughing) (gun clicking) - [Caribe] Pendrake you're not worth killing. (Terry screaming) - [Terry] Oh my god! Oh my god no! No! (dog barking) (truck rumbling) (serene music) (tense music) (grunting) (water splashing) (grunting) (water splashing) (monkey chattering) (intense music) (grunting) (gun reloading) (gun firing) (Caribe shouting) (gentle music) ♫ Tell me what you love ♫ And I'll tell you who you are ♫ Did you ever love too much ♫ And did it break your heart ♫ And will you ever learn ♫ Before your life is done ♫ To love all things ♫ And love the ♫ Sun
