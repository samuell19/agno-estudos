(HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING) DJ: ATL, get on your feet and make some noise. It's time for the Shaquille O'Neal All Star Comedy Jam! Atlanta, are you in the building? Are you ready for your host Faison Love? (AUDIENCE CHEERING) You know I'm cleaning the motherfucker. Look at me. I should've come in a motherfucking hearse 'cause I'm killing this motherfucker. Atlanta, Georgia, I know y'all been talking shit. I'm hearing you on Twitter and all the bullshit. I thought I was cute. I just found out I was ugly. I'm walking down Peachtree, it's like, "Oh, my God, Precious!" 'Cause a lot of people, we don't know we're ugly. Shaq don't know. Shaq, I'm... Nigger, you know. It's all good, we're beautiful inside. You know you're ugly 'cause people, when you call yourself ugly, they never come to your rescue. "Say, man, I'm ugly." "Well, you know..." "It bes like that sometimes." But we're beautiful people. I knew I was fat. Yeah. See? Now you niggers is, "Yeah, yeah." Yeah, I knew I was fat, but see, you know what, in America right now, y'all are attacking the fat man. All these commercials about SlimTrim and all this, "Bitch, go to the motherfucking gym." I go to the gym, these motherfuckers won't let me in. These motherfuckers talking about, "It's too late." I go to Jenny Craig. The bitch give me all the food, I ate all the food right there. She said, "No, you're supposed to last all week." I said, "Bitch, this ain't gonna last all week." They had pies and shit. Fat niggers, we're coming back. Rick Ross! Nigger don't even rap. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) That's the nigger. If Biggie was alive, Biggie would do an album with that nigger. (GRUNTS) ♪ Nigger ♪ My nigger... ♪ Baby, baby... (GRUNTING) Atlanta done changed. I used to come down here. Niggers done changed out here. Y'all done got all sophisticated and shit. Talking all, (MIMICS) "Hello there, would you like some chicken?" I used to come down here, y'all were... (SPEAKING GIBBERISH) "...you crazy. You crazy." And that was the white folks. I go to the mall. I'm trying to get some shoes and shit. I hear, "'Scuse." "'Scuse." "'Scuse." I know these niggers ain't talking to me. I turn around, these niggers standing there with lip-gloss. Their lips was all shimmering. "'Scuse!" I was like, "What nigger?" "I said, ''Scuse.'" Then I looked and said, "Usher?" (AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING) What you gonna do? What you gonna do? What you gonna do? Let me tell you something, fat people, we're under attack. They're talking shit about us and all this bullshit. We need to be like them "'scuses"s niggers. (CHUCKLES) We need to be like the gay people, fuck it! You can't just say nothing about no gay people! You say something about the gays, niggers is ready to march. "What did he say? What did he say?" (ANGRY GRUNT) (BREATHING HEAVILY) "We're gonna Chick-fil-A." They be talking about fat people like we ain't shit, Shaq. We need to get together like the gay people, organize. Maybe do a hunger... (LAUGHS) Maybe we need... We need to go on a march. It ain't gonna be no long march. (LAUGHING) Niggers be all lying side of Popeyes. "Fuck this march, nigger." I'm glad to be in Atlanta. Yo! I see some... What nigger? You just mad 'cause you don't know who your daddy is. You looking at me like, "I think..." You'll never be the man your mama was, nigger. (LAUGHS) Who you think you fucking with? I'm from another era. I'm from the '80s. We tough! Y'all ain't tough, y'all soft. Y'all... Yeah. You little... Yeah. Y'all motherfuckers and these little punk-ass kids y'all are having, they soft, too. I got nephews, little punk bitch motherfuckers. These little punk motherfuckers want to go bike riding. I'll take your little bitch-ass bike riding, little punk motherfucking black-ass kid. I go outside, I'm waiting for these niggers to go get their bike. These niggers come out with helmets and fucking pads. I said, "We ain't going on the freeway. You little bitch-ass nigger." Comic gonna be great, baby. It's what you worked for. Ten years in the making, nigger. Dreams do come true. Ladies and gentlemen, all the way from Louisiana, Robert Powell. Give it up, y'all! (HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING) All right. Okay. All right. Let's get this shit over with. How y'all doing, Atlanta? Good, good, good. Let me get this shit. They didn't give me that much time so this shit's gonna go real, real fast. I'm the new nigger. I've been in Atlanta for about two days, I've been fucking up since I got here. I'm ready to go. My first mistake was I went and ate at this Chinese buffet that they got around the corner from our room. It's good food at the buffet, too, if you don't mind shitting. If you don't mind shitting, then I recommend the Chinese buffet. It's right around the corner from the room. 'Cause I had to shit at the Chinese buffet. I had to shit there. I was sitting there eating with my friend, Smooth Earl, and he's like, "Nigger what's wrong with your face?" I said, "Dude, I'm two centimeters dilated. "I'm sitting in here shitting on myself in this Chinese." They got their Chinese food. Y'all got real Chinese people cooking. We don't have that shit. I ate an egg roll, that shit was diabolical. That shit came right, right back. I ate that, I said, "Nigger, did I eat that or drop it?" Let me get my ass up from here and go on to the back. I picked my plate up and walked off. That lady said, "You need a to-go plate?" I said, "Ma'am, I'm taking this to the commode. "I got to eat this shit in the bathroom." First time in my life, my shit stank to me. Normally, I could take my shit. It's other folks' shit I can't take. I was in there killing my goddamn self. Little Chinese lady, "You need another root beer?" I said, "Bitch, bring me a baby wipe." I had to wipe my damn thigh off. I'll tell you what the issue was, too. I don't know if you've ever been to a Chinese buffet, but they got these red ribs on the buffet. You ain't never seen this, ma'am? They got some dog dick red ribs. On the buffet. Y'all don't have dogs? Corvette red ribs on the buffet. Don't fuck with that. That ain't for us, that's for them. Little lady gonna tell me, "You left your fortune cookie." Bitch, I know my fortune. I'm gonna be shitting blood all week, fucking around with this Chinese buffet. That's my fortune. Second mistake I made, I went to the nice mall y'all got, fantastic mall. Nice, whatever. I got hit on twice in the mall today. That's the good news. Problem was, both times it was by dudes. And I don't fuck around like that no more. I don't know what these Shaq people done told y'all... I don't know what they told y'all about me on that damn Internet. But me and Donnie McClurkin, we changed our lives. Yes, I said it. I don't give a fuck. Okay, let me back up, 'cause I don't need nobody outside protesting and shit. I don't have no problem with gay people. Some of my best friends are going to hell. So I don't have no... I'm not judging. No, don't "oh." Don't "uh-oh" me. That shit is in the Bible. I don't know the chapter but it's in the red words. Check the red words. Them the important words. I have no problem with that, you know what I'm saying. But my problem was the dude hit on me so convincingly that he had me think for a second... Now, I'm not gay, you know what I'm saying. But this nigger hit on me with such gusto like, "I know you gay with me." And I'm not, you know what I'm saying. And if I was, I wouldn't be attracted to... Well, I'm not gonna get into what I'd be attracted to if I was gay. 'Cause you're right, that's gay. I'm trying to explain. If I was, I wouldn't be... He was a girly gay. I'm not gay, but if I was, you know what I'm saying. Shit. I'm gonna need me a man. You gonna have to work for this little ass if you're gonna get it. I'm not gonna just be giving ass away. My mama ain't raised no slut. You gonna respect me in this damn mall. Nigger. Girl ass. He had his hair all slick like Prince and shit, and had these high boots on that women wear. Came over to me smelling like perm and pre-cum and whatever the fuck else, I don't know. Don't ask me how I know what that smell like. I didn't have no problem with that, the problem was he had this glittery lotion shit on his hands. And I reach out, shake his hand, pull my hand back. Now I got the glitter shit on me. Now I don't know if you know this, but glitter is like the herpes of the arts and crafts world. Once you got the glitter, you just fucking got the glitter, you know what I'm saying. Now I got to walk around Atlanta all day like I done beat the dick of a unicorn or some shit. I haven't never beat the dick of a unicorn. I'm just assuming that if you do beat the dick of a unicorn, that glitter will come out. That's a safe assumption to make. I went on ahead and gave the nigger my number 'cause I don't know nobody else. I could have friends. Then the third mistake, they gave us this driver. I don't know why they put this nice-ass mall y'all got in the middle of this badass neighborhood, but we got lost. And the driver ain't even from here, which is stupid, you know what I'm saying. We got lost in a bad neighborhood. And as soon as we turned down the street, I said, "Sir, just take me back to my room." It was niggers everywhere. Lord, I don't know the name of the neighborhood but shit, we ain't got to live like this no more. Who is the mayor? God damn. This shit need to be shut the fuck down. It looked like a Haiti playground. Just... Sir. White guy, this is the 47% Romney was talking about. You know what I'm talking about? Just them. Bunch of badass black kids, playing in the street, don't nobody want to move. Just... No shirt, no ball, just... A flock of failure playing in the fucking street. I can say that. I'll move on 'cause I see y'all sensitive about it. I don't know if y'all could tell, but I'm the asshole on the tour. I done got fired about five or six times, too. Shaq fires me every other weekend. I got fired about three weeks ago, I'll tell you why, too. But I thought I was well within my rights, you know what I'm saying. We're in New York at the University of Syracuse. This 18-year-old boy goes to band rehearsal, and then after band rehearsal, he's goes back to his room and hung himself. Now Shaq, with his nice ass, first thing he said was, "I wonder why the boy hung himself?" First thing I said was, "I wonder why the boy went to band rehearsal?" If you fittin' to go, then what the fuck is you rehearsing for? The Lord don't need no band, if that's what you're doing. He should've been somewhere writing the note. And dividing his shit up amongst his friends. We in Syracuse, New York and I done walked right out on stage and said that shit. Probably was too early. The dude was probably still dangling and shit and I'm on stage making jokes about it. Oh, well. I'll tell you another time I almost got fired, too. We was at this party in Detroit, an after-party at this damn club. It's packed and shit. It was a ghetto-ass club, but, you know, whatever. And out of the corner of my eye, on the dance floor, I see this man in a wheelchair and all he can work is this shit right here. Para... I'm just telling the story. Paraplegic guy, but he's getting drunk 'cause he got a straw of Hennessy going to his mouth, in the club. I don't know how he got there. I ain't seen no ramps. I ain't seen no handicap parking, none of that shit. Well, as sure as shit stinks, a fight break out. Everybody trying to get out of the club, people are getting trampled. Somebody knocked the man over, you know what I'm saying. They was kind of walking on him and shit. Shaq saw it and went and helped the man get back in his wheelchair. I saw it, but I ain't see it, see it. So I kept on running to where it was safe and secure. Shaq find me 15 minutes later. I'm outside standing by the police. He gonna ask me why I didn't help the man get back in his wheelchair. I say, "Shaq, that man is paralyzed already. "He can't feel none of that shit." Old, my ass. I'm not fittin' to fuck up my good legs fucking with dead legs at the club. I won't do it. I just won't do it. He the one with the motor, he should've gave us a ride up out of this bitch. He saw them people fighting, he could see. Shit, now all three of us get trampled. Now all of us in here in the Luther Vandross edition Hoverounds and shit next week. Yes, I said that, too. I got to stop getting fired though. See, I'm happy to have this damn job. It pays well, too. I got to move out of my grandma's house. I was staying with my grandma in this little-bitty-ass house in the middle of Monroe, Louisiana. And staying with Grandma is cool and shit. It's cool, but one of the rules at Grandma's house is you can't close no doors at Grandma's house. And that's fine too, until shit fumes travel down the hallway and into your nose at 6:00 in the morning. And you shouldn't have to live like this, you know what I'm saying. I thought it was breakfast sausage at first, but it wasn't. I got the cable cut on in my grandma's house since I'm staying there. She ain't never had cable in her life. This was a mistake. 'Cause now I got to explain to her some of the ghetto shit she sees on there. She's sitting there watching videos and Plies had this song out called Give me that Becky. My grandma done called me in the living room, asked me, "What does 'give me that Becky' mean?" Now, how do you explain to your grandma that give me that Becky means give me some head? I told her that it means, "Give me a hug." I said, "That's what it means, Grandma." She takes her ass down to the church, and is in the parking lot telling these children to give her some Becky. Now they done kicked her ass off the mother's board. And she mad at me. I thought that was a safe lie to tell. She called me one time I was on the road, she was like, "What is this K-Y Jelly "they're advertising on this TV?" Now, how do you explain to your grandma that K-Y Jelly is a fucking lube? You can't tell her that. I told her, "Grandma, it's just regular jelly, like every other thing else." Yeah. Three weeks go by, I call my grandma, I say, "What you doing?" She said, "Nothing. Sitting over here with my mouth numb." "Grandma, what the fuck is your mouth doing numb?" She said, "I went and got some of that K-Y Jelly and put it..." I said, "You take your ass back there and throw up "before you fuck around and die." My grandma took her elderly ass to the Walgreens and got some warming sensation K-Y Jelly and put it on Popeyes biscuits. She's sitting her ass in the front room all day talking about her gums won't stop sweating. I said, "If you don't take your juicy-throated ass to the back... "Before you fuck around and pass away." My little nephew call her Wet-Wet now 'cause she's sitting up there spitting all day. She say she should've knew something was wrong with it 'cause the whole biscuit slid down her throat. Oh, shit. I love this job though. This is a fantastic job. I get to hang out with Shaq and shit. We went to the strip club last night I won't say the name of it, but it was a ghetto-ass strip club. I won't be sued. I went to the strip club with $12. That's what I allocated to spend at the strip club. They think all of us are rich 'cause we hang out with Shaq, and I'm not. And I took the time out to find 12 $1 bills for these hos and they were unappreciative, you know what I'm talking about. They so dumb, I'm in there throwing my 12 ones. They turn around, I pick my 12 ones back up. I throw my 12 ones again. Out of nowhere, this pimp comes into the room and starts whispering in one of the stripper's ear, then he leaves. So then, the stripper starts yelling out prices. Now any time they start yelling out prices, that means they want to do some extra shit. Well, I didn't bring "extra shit" money. I brought $12, you know what I'm talking about. And I don't want to do that. I'm gonna do something to myself when I get back to my room, you feel me. For free. This bitch told me that it's $100 for head and $200 for everything. I told her, "Fuck no." She told Shaq that it's $100 for head, $200 for everything, and he says, "Can we split it?" Shaq wants me to split some ass with him like it's a pizza. Now, I didn't want to do it but this shit was on sale, you know what I'm saying. I ain't gonna pass up no sale shit. It's 50% off at this point. That's my time. I'm Robert Powell. Thank y'all for having me. Whoa, whoa. Whoa. About to go do this, man. It's on, this is it right here. History is about to be made. About to break records. Coming in the game. Taking over, baby. Ladies and gentlemen, all the way from Chicago by way of ATL, give it up for Lavar Walker. (HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING) What up, Atlanta? Hey, make some noise. Do something. I'm here. Shit. I can't do the club no more. I cannot do the club. You know why I can't do the club? 'Cause every club in Atlanta got an over-aggressive bathroom man that lurks in the goddamn bathroom. I went out to the club last night. I went in the bathroom, minding my business, taking a piss. This nigger pulled out some clippers and tried to line the back of my goddamn neck up. I'm standing there, I feel a little buzz. What the fuck? "Hey, brother, you want some DVDs? Peppermint? "Cologne? Anything to help you, right here in the bathroom. "We got it all, porno movies, anything. "Plan B pills." What the fuck? When do you make that decision to become a bathroom man? Where do you go to become a bathroom man? Where do you go? ITT? DeVry? Lincoln Technical institute? Everest College? What makes you want to wake up and look at your woman and go, "Baby, look. I got a wonderful idea. "I'm thinking about getting some Black & Mild. "Peppermint, cologne, DVD, lunchmeat, cereal. "Take it all over the bathrooms in all the clubs in Atlanta. "Bitch, if you believe in me, you can work in the women's bathroom. "And do hair and nails and abortions "right in the women's bathroom. "And then, we can one day have a son "that can grow up to be a bathroom man like his daddy. "We'd be like the Jeffersons." Sit your stupid ass down. I can't do that club shit. Got some damn groupie men... Men groupies in the club. I saw a nigger knock a girl down trying to get to a damn celebrity. I watched it go down, I'm in the VIP. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it with my own eyes. Girl stood right next to us saying, "Oh, my God. Is that T.I.?" "Where he at?" "Right there." "Oh, shit, T.I.P. T.I.P! "T.I.P! T.I.P! "T.I.P! Hey, T.I.P! We're here!" T.I. just looks back at the nigger and was like, (MIMICS T.I.) "First of all, I am thoroughly, thoroughly disgusted "in which the way that you atrociously knocked over the young lady. "I will not tolerate, with due diligence, "any way in which you go to begin "to believe any transition that came..." I'm like, "What the fuck did this nigger just say?" Using them big-ass words and shit. He goes from being smart, yeah, and that nigger get real hood for no fucking reason and shit. Like, "T.I., you got caught with a gun, you went to jail. "You almost lost it all. "Tell us what was it like to go to jail?" "First of all, I accept full responsibility for my demise. "And if anyone, whosoever, then, there, thou, "begins to believe any of the transitions, "just pose him against me. "If you gonna respect one thing, "you gonna respect this hustle." What the fuck? Nigger be walking off, that nigger's back be straight. "Dig this here. This here is the king. "I have returned "to do everything and anything in which I came to do. "I walk as if I am a gingerbread man "that has been scraped up off of a plate." Sit your ass down, T.I. I stay out of the club. Women will fool you in the club. You think a woman is fine, but they ain't fine. A lot of them got that goddamn body magic girdle shit on. You don't know what you get till you get them home and get them naked. I was messing with this girl one time, she unzipped out of the body magic, her whole goddamn body spilled on the goddamn floor. I had to get a bowl to put this bitch out. I said, "Bitch, I didn't know you ain't got no bones in your body. "That shit is holding you the fuck together?" Like that. What the fuck? I had to end up shaking her ass out like a sheet. Niggers be in the club, mad as hell. "Hey, hey, man, these hos are tripping on me. "I don't know. What's wrong with these hos in the club?" "I know what's wrong." "What?" "The reason you ain't getting no none "it's 'cause you won't let that stupid ass hairline you got go." This little tiny nigger... Hey, look, if your hairline is back here by your goddamn ear, cut the shit off. I get tired of coming to the barber shop, nigger's shit is way the fuck back here. This nigger is sitting in the chair like he's got a fucking little yarmulke on his goddamn head. You should know it's time to get that shit cut off, if they got to lay you in the barber chair like you in the fucking dental chair, and that bitch, they laying your ass down. Nigger, let the goddamn shit go. You ever go to a club and see that one old nigger, he got one dread left walking around. Leave the club, 14,000 fucking flyers on your car. You need a fucking briefcase to pick all that shit off the goddamn car. I'm driving home one night, I picked all the shit off my window. I'm driving home, a nigger jumps up in my back seat, "Hey, nigger, it's going down at the club, 10:00." "Where the fuck did you come from? "Get the fuck out of my goddamn..." That's why I'm doing this comedy, man. I got to make my dream come true of being a comedian. I'm tired of my goddamn job. How many of y'all tired of your job? (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) How many of y'all go to work and just pull up at the job, sit in the fucking car, sit in the lot and be like, "Oh, shit! "I don't feel like this goddamn shit today. "Oh, God! Shit! I should've called in dead. "Fuck it, I should've called in dead. "I don't feel like fucking with this shit today. "Oh, shit." You go in there and you work the job, man. I don't like my job. I'll tell you what I do. I went to school a very long time. I'm not just a comedian, but I happen to be a pharmacist. Okay? I went to school for a very long time. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) I earned a doctorate degree in pharmacy. Seven years of school, studying the hardest sciences known to man. But yet I find myself working behind the goddamn cash register at CVS, ringing up cookies and juice and dog food and milk and goddamn cereal, and I'm not getting the respect that I deserve as a proper healthcare professional. And, people, let me tell you something, you got a raggedy-ass car, your driver's side window does not roll down, that mean don't bring your stupid ass to the drive through! Sitting your dumbass out in the goddamn driveway, backing up my line 'cause it's taking you 20 minutes to open your raggedy-ass car door up. Here you step out of the car, "You got something for Smith?" Walk your dumbass to the goddamn store. I deal with stupid people at work. I'm at work the other day, nigger came in there with two teeth in his mouth, gonna ask me where the damn teeth whitening is. I said, "Hey, man, if you don't just wipe them two goddamn teeth off "and get the fuck out of my face... "Sitting up here, wasting my damn time. "You got these two little-ass teeth "but you want to whiten them up." Old women call, they can't get to the question. I don't know what it is. I'm at work. Phone ringing off the hook. People in the drive through. I'm getting cussed out all day. Old woman call, can't get to the damn question. Phone ring. (MIMICS PHONE RINGING) "Pharmacy department, how may I help you?" "Hey, how you're doing over there? "You're the pharmacist over there?" "Yes, ma'am, I am." "Okay. I have a question for you." "Okay, what's the question, ma'am?" "About six weeks ago, we put, uh, "my oldest brother, Mr. Leroy Jones, into the nursing home. "However, I did not have proper identification "or power of attorney to take him a pair of medicated socks "that he needed, so I had to get on the phone "and call my other cousin, Lenny, "who lives five hours away in Mississippi. "And you know Lenny's an alcoholic. "So he didn't even come to pick up the phone. "So I ended up having to get up, putting my housecoat on, "let the dog out, put the gaiter on. "I went down to the Walmart about 4:00 in the morning "to go down there and get socks. "So I finally ended up meeting with him, "now the question I have for you is, "what time will his medication be ready for pickup?" God damn! Oh! Oh! All of that! Old black men, they like to come to the pharmacy. And old black men don't go to the doctor. Look at a lot of y'all old asses out here. Y'all don't go to the doctor for nothing. You could be at home with a whole nigger growing out your chest. But you gonna say, "Hey, look, I ain't going to no damn doctor. "I done had this shit growing out of me for over 28 years. "That's longer than you've been alive. "Anything wrong, I'll put a little salve on my chest. I'm okay." He'd bring his old ass to the pharmacy, with his health priorities in disarray. Ring this old guy up. Came to the pharmacy. Had two medications. I'm like, "Look, uh, Mr. Charles." I don't know why they got two first names. "Mr. Charles, both those medicines, "that's gonna be $225 and 15 cents." "Shit!" I don't know why they gotta pull up on their pant, too. "God damn!" "$225 and 15 cents." Now when the price is high, my line's backed up, shit's going crazy. He gotta have a conversation with somebody in line about his high-ass price. "Look, Mr. Charles, it's gonna be $225.15." "Shit!" "Shaq, they talking $225 and 15 cents for this medication. "This shit don't make no sense. "I thought Obama had passed the goddamn healthcare." Now when the price is high, he want to get comfortable at the cash register. I say, "Look, Mr. Charles. "Both medicines are gonna be $225 and 15 cents." "Shit! "God damn! "That's for both of them? "Shit! "Look, I'll tell you what you do. "'Cause I ain't got all my money. "You keep the blood pressure medicine, "give me the Viagra, let me get the hell on up out of here." Yo, my name is Lavar. P! I'm backstage at Shaq's All Star Comedy Jam. I'm the first British comic ever to do it. And I'm the only female tonight. I better be good. Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to give, with all your might, give it up for her, a big hand for one of the funniest women in the game, all the way from London, Gina Yashere. (HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING) Thank you, DJ. Thank you. It's my birthday today, so you gotta be nice to me, Atlanta. It's my fucking birthday. And I've come all the way from England for this shit. (LIGHT APPLAUSE) Yeah, one person clapped. Fuck's sake, Atlanta. You guys are bougie as shit. Clap! England! (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) England! London! I'm letting you guys get used to the way I speak. I know 'cause some of you are looking confused. Did you guys know there were black people in England? Did you know? No, before Idris Elba, did you know? 'Cause I know you're looking confused. You, lady, I can see you looking at me like... She's looking at me like, "This bitch sounds like the butler from Fresh Prince." Yes, I'm from England. Obviously, black people aren't indigenous to England. My mother came from Nigeria, West Africa to England. (BARKING) Africa! I went back to Africa, went back to Nigeria, to get in touch with my roots, my African roots. My roots. And discovered that my roots are in London. Africa scared the fuck out of me. It scared the fuck out of me. It's a scary place. It's a scary place, Atlanta. You guys are looking at me like... In Africa, it's a hood, a proper ghetto in Africa. You think you got... There's guys in Atlanta that think they're thugs. "We're thugs! "We're motherfucking thugs! "We're thugs, motherfucker, yeah. We're thugs." Go to Africa and see hungry thugs. I got robbed in a taxi doing 60 miles an hour. And they were on foot. I'm in a car. I'm on the freeway. I want to film this shit because I don't know when I'm coming back to Africa again. Never. So what I need to do is film this. So I put my camcorder out of the window. And I was filming Africa. And then I felt... (WHOOSHES) And my camera was gone. So it's good to be in America. I like America. It's cool. I've learned a lot about black people from watching movies. I'm from England. I didn't know about black people except from films like Boyz n the Hood. That's the kind of shit that I used to watch. So when I came to America, I thought I had this shit down. I moved to LA, I went to Compton. I thought, "Yeah, fuck it. "I'm gonna go hang out in Compton with my negroes." So I went to Compton, I saw a guy standing on a street corner, baggy pants, baseball cap. I went up to him, I went, "Hey, "what's popping, motherfucker G-Unit." He took my watch. That's what happened. Like, in America, your racism is good. It's in your face. I know where I stand in America. I know that I'm never going to Alabama or Mississippi 'cause I've seen your movies. I know where I stand. 'Cause in England, we've got our racism in England. I used to work on a building site. We've got our rednecks. I remember a guy coming up to me at work one day and go, "Gina! "You know what your name spells backwards? "A nig!" So I went home to my mom, I was like, "Mother, you've ruined my life. "You know what my name spells backwards?" And my mom was like, "You go back there and you tell that bastard "your full name is Regina." And I was like that. "A niger, Mom." Now, I know the "N" word is not a big deal to black people in America. I know you guys call each other nigger a lot, right? Yeah. "Nigger. Nigger, what? Fuck you, nigger. "Bitch-ass nigger. "Pussy-ass nigger. "Faggot-ass motherfucking nigger. "Nigger bitch, what, nigger, what?" See, I'm from England. We don't call each other nigger in England. We don't. We don't call each other nigger. In England, when you hear the word "nigger," you go... You're happy. It's usually a racist white person. So when you hear the word nigger, you go, "Did you just call me nigger? "That's wonderful, because that means I can stab you in the throat." All my friends are like, "No, Gina, it's different, it's nigga. "N-I-G-G-A. Nigga. "Not nigger. "Nigga." I don't give a fuck how it's spelt. The shit sounds the same to me. I can't exactly go to a Ku Klux Klan rally and go, "Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. "You in the white hood. Is that 'nigger' or 'nigga'? "Oh, is it 'nigger'? Okay, can I get a head start? I'm gonna run this way." I'm not a big fan of the rap music. I like old school rap. I used to like rap from the '80s. I used to like De La Soul. Big Daddy Kane. Africa Mombasa. Special Ed. Old school shit. I don't like the rappers now. I don't like them. Every rap record is, "Bitch, ho, ho, bitch. "Bitch, chicken head, trick, bitch-ho, "ho, bitch, ho, bitch." These guys have got mothers. I can't imagine their mothers are proud of what they do. 'Cause mothers, they like to boast about their sons, right? Mothers like to boast about their sons. I can't imagine some rapper's mother boasting to her friends, going, "You don't know my son? (LAUGHS) "He's the one who did that song, "I'll Fuck A Hole In Her Eye." Every rap record's just cursing. Just cursing. When I hear rap, this is all I hear when I hear rap. ♪ Motherfucker, ho, bitch, motherfucker, ho ♪ Fuck you, bitch, my fuckfish ho ♪ Suck my dick, bitch, motherfucker, ho Dick, dick, big fat dick ♪ I got a big, fat, motherfucking dick ♪ Motherfucker, ho, bitch, motherfucker, ho ♪ Fuck you, motherfucker, bitch, motherfucker ♪ Suck my dick, bitch, motherfucker ho ♪ Suck, suck, suck my dick ♪ Dick, dick, big fat dick ♪ Motherfucker dick bitch, motherfucker ho ♪ Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, bitch ♪ Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, bitch ♪ Nigger, nigger, ho Nigger, nigger, ho ♪ Nigger bitch ho, motherfucker bitch ho ♪ Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, bo ♪ Bo, ho, ho, bitch, ho ♪ Fuck you, bitch, motherfucker bitch, ho ♪ Suck my dick, bitch, ho, bitch, ho ♪ Fuck you, nigger Nigger, nigger, nigger ♪ Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, bitch ♪ Nigger, bitch, ho, bitch, ho ♪ Motherfucker ho, bitch, motherfucker ho ♪ Diamonds ♪ Bitch, ho, motherfucker, ho ♪ Fuck you, nigger bitch Ho, bitch, ho ♪ Fuck you, motherfucker, bitch, motherfucker ♪ I like America, though. I've learned a lot. Since moving to America, what have I learnt? I'd never seen Hispanic people before I moved to America. Never. We haven't got lots of Hispanic people in England. We haven't. We haven't got lots of Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans. I suppose it's a much longer swim. But I'd never... I get the feeling I shouldn't have said that. I'd never seen Hispanic people, especially the dark ones. You've got darker-skinned Hispanic people. They're the ones that confuse me. The Dominicans and shit. First time I came to America, I was in New York. I'm on a subway. I'm sitting opposite three people I assumed were black. And then they started speaking, "Que pasa?" I was like, "Fuck! "Black people have their own language in America." Listen, you guys have been amazing. I'm Gina Yashere. Thank you very much. Goodbye. Thank you. Here's your boy, Finesse Mitchell. Native son, Southwest Atlanta. Born and bred, born and raised. Hey, Shaq's All Star Comedy Jam. We here. I'm up next. I'm about to murk this bitch. We did a movie together called Who's Your Caddy? He's been on Saturday Night Live. He's from the ATL. Ladies and gentlemen, Finesse Mitchell. (HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING) Give it up for Tigger, everybody. What's up, Atlanta? Make some noise! (AUDIENCE SCREAMING) Yeah! Your boy, Finesse Mitchell. Happy to be back home in my hometown, ATL. SWAT, Cascade Road, Doug High. All that good stuff. I got to represent, got to say it. But your boy a little bit older now. Little bit older. And black people, you know when you're getting old. 'Cause when you in clubs and rap music start offending you, you old. You old. I was trying to party with Shaq last night. I heard Lil Wayne talking about... ♪ Cut off a nigga head Make him suck his own dick ♪ I said, "Oh, Lord, I'm a Christian. I can't be in here, Shaq. "Where's my coat? I just came to dougie, brother, "I don't want to do all that shit." It's like seven crimes in one verse. I don't believe that shit. And now kids can go on YouTube and they can type in any artist, pull up explicit lyrics and a video. So now your kids are learning stuff way before they're supposed to. I walked in on my niece. I almost had a heart attack. Nine years old. Y'all know who Juicy J is? AUDIENCE: Yes. Bands A Make Her Dance? She wasn't singing the chorus, she knew the verse. She was in the mirror, half-dressed. ♪ You say no to ratchet pussy Juicy J can't ♪ I was like... Ah! Hey, don't do that. We're Christians, don't do that. You don't know your four timetables, but you know that shit, huh? It's tough growing up now, man. I used to love growing up here in Atlanta. Whoo! Atlanta's a great city to grow up in, man. Now here's the great thing. You ain't really got to have a lot of money. If you in your 20s... If you in your 20s, make some noise. Make some noise right now. (AUDIENCE SCREAMING) We used to go out every weekend with no money, and come home drunk as fuck every night. Ain't nothing like that in Atlanta, man. And you know when you in your 20s, you ain't got no money. You got to get drunk at the house. You don't know how much drinks gonna cost where you're going, so you want to make sure you have a good time. You get fucked up at home. And by then, you know just how much to pour, put it in that cup, driving, in-between your thighs, with a little blue or red plastic cup, drinking vodka cranberry. And you know just how much to pour, that when you get to where you're going, you already fucked up. You in the parking lot, and in your 20s, you can throw up in front of your friends, in front of the club, and that don't stop your night. Your night just started. You be like, "Hey, girl." "Hey." (RETCHES) "Ugh! Fuck you, bitch. "Whoo! "Look at my shoes, I look cute. "I'm killing you, bitch. Look at me." Wiping corn off the side of your face, you don't give a fuck. You can be a girl and... If you a girl throwing up, I've seen it. Other girls in their 20s, come out of nowhere and help you throw up. I've seen girls come out of nowhere and pull a girl's hair out the way. Another girl will come up and rub her on her back. Another girl will walk up and say something real soft. Like, "Shush, shush, shush. I know. I know. Shush, shush, shush." And when you're trying to help her, somebody that always come up behind y'all, that's drunker than everybody, that think they a fucking doctor. Annoying as fuck. He won't shut up. "What's wrong with her? "That's your friend? "She fucked up already, huh? "Keep her head up. "You need to eat some bread. "You was probably mixing your dark liquor with your light liquor. "You not supposed to do that." 20s be fun. Now in your 30s... You throw up in the parking lot in your 30s, your night is over. You gotta go back home. You and everybody who came with you gotta go back home. Two cars, eight people, going back home. People in the second car don't even know what happened. "Why are we leaving?" "Sharon threw up." "Who the fuck is Sharon?" "I don't know, that bitch in the first car. I don't even know." Forty and older, if you in here, you know damn well your ass take it real slow. Your eye start twitching, you be like, "Oh, shit, let me put this shit down. Here we go. "That's Jesus talking to me. Yes, sir, I heard you, Lord." It takes somebody in their 40s to be on the dance floor with young people, they move real quick, they throw up in their mouth. They be like, "Oh, shit." "You need another drink?" "No, I need a Tums. "This shit is in my chest." And my problem is, I look young. That's what tricked me. I still think I got it. I'd be in the mirror at night, like, "Oh, shit, you're gonna kill them. They ain't ready for you." Then I take a couple of steps, and I be like, "What the fuck is wrong with my knee? "This was a good knee last year, damn it. "And my shoulder hurt, it's gonna rain. God damn. "My granddaddy knew when it was gonna rain. "My daddy knew. "Now I got that power." You get older, everything's different for me now. My sex game ain't even the same. I used to be a beast. Man. Shit, now? You gotta catch me on the right night. You put your leg on me in the bed at the wrong time, "Bitch, it's hot. Go over there. I'm not... "SportsCenter, I missed the score. "I gotta watch this shit all over again for the next hour." My pumps are down. I got 57 pumps now, that's all I got. And what's great about being older, you ain't gotta lie to nobody, 'cause girls be like, "Oh, shit, "tonight, it's going down all night." And I be like, "Not all night. "I got a hot 57 for you. Fifty-seven pumps, that's all I got. "And my knees start buckling at 54, so you know that... "I try to stretch the last ones out, "but after a while, I got Bambi legs like a motherfucker." I'm like, "Oh, shit." "We gonna do it all night long." "Well, we better start at 11:59, bitch, 'cause I've got 57 pumps. "Stretch them out how you want it. "But that's what I got." I see all you young people. Young guy, I see you. I'm gonna give you a sex move. I can't use it no more, all right? I used to be a beast. This was my favorite one. I stick my fists in the mattress, I be on top of the girl, stick my fists in the mattress, raise up off her and lock my elbows, look down at her and count my pumps. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20... That's some sexy shit, too. And see how you got the little cross on your neck? Wear that. No, a 32-inch chain with a little Jesus cross on it, you pumping and then Jesus' feet hitting her in the chin. Women like that, too. "Ha-ha, Jesus!" You can have that one, all right? I can't use it no more, I ain't got the same upper body strength I used to have. Ain't nothing worse than doing your move, and in the middle of your move, you feel your elbows start to give out. She got her eyes closed, she don't know what's going on. She like, "You like it?" You like, "Bitch, you better move. "Here I come. Oh, shit. "I done bust your damn nose. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. "It rained today, my shoulder hurt. My bad. "I tried to do my move." Shaq, don't you ever try that move. Your fucking arms give out, you'll kill a bitch. Shaq will be on the phone, "Trade me again, I killed another one." (LAUGHS) Sex ain't even sexy, young people, when you get older. When you get 35 and older, you've been with the same person for a long time, it don't be nothing romantic about sex. Your woman come in and be like, "Is your back all right? "How about tonight? Your back is good? Tonight? Maybe? No? "Tell me. What you think? Maybe? No? No? Your back? "Okay, still hurt? Okay." Dudes be the same way. "Baby. How you... Your stomach, is it gassy? "You bloated? Okay. Okay." You be a grown man, trying to think if it's all right to go in your own bedroom and ask your wife for sex. You just be standing out in the hallway, "Okay, she ain't doing shit. "This look like a good time to go in there." Your son sneak up behind you, "Go in there, Daddy, she ain't doing shit!" "Go to bed, Dequarius. Take your ass to bed. "Making me nervous." But fellows, when you older, shit, you better stretch. You better stretch. Ain't nothing worse than getting that damn charley horse in the back of your thigh. That shit hurt like a motherfucker. And you can't even pretend like... You gotta keep going. You gotta work your way through it. 'Cause if you stop, you know how women are. "Aw, did I break the baby?" So you gotta act like nothing wrong. And she don't even know what's going on. You're hitting her from behind. She think you roleplaying. You like, "Yeah, you like that, huh?" "I like it." (GRUNTS) "Look, I'm not talking to you, look that way. (SCREAMS) "Look that way. I'm not talking to you." "What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?" "Shut up, Dequarius." Now, young people, y'all know when y'all having great sex. 'Cause young sex is the best sex. You don't need to be romantic. You get to talk shit. You get to come in a room and be like, "I'm gonna beat that shit up." What she say? "Beat this shit up. "I want you to. You ain't beating shit up." And then, you can call the play when you're young. That's the great thing about young sex. You... Too quick. You be like, "Don't move, don't move." And she'll listen 'cause she like you. She still like you, it ain't nothing... No reservations about nothing. "Don't move." She be like... "Now?" "No, wait, wait, wait." (PANTS) "Now?" "Wait, wait, wait." "Okay." (GRUNTING) "You so stupid." Try that shit when you get older. That shit don't go down like that. Your woman be so tired of you coming quick. You be like, "Oh, shit. Don't move. Don't move." She be like, "Already?" You be like, "Don't move!" She be like, "Fuck that." You be like... Oh! "I told you not to move." She be like, "Whatever. Oh, my God. "I am so sick of this. Oh, my God. "Get your own rag. I'm not going that way. I'm not going that way. "Fuck that, no. You get on my nerves." You laying on the bed, rubbing your stomach off with a football sock. "I'm sorry." "What happened, Daddy?" "Shut up, Dequarius." "That's my sock, Daddy." "Shut up, Dequarius." You know who look like they really having a good time? Barack and Michelle. Don't they look like they in love for real? (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) I love them, man. I know they be roleplaying like a motherfucker, too. You can tell Barack like to play around like that. They be in the bedroom. Nobody in the room. They act like they at a dinner party. He be like, "Come on over here." There'll be nobody in the room and Michelle stays in character. She'll be like, "Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. "Hey. Oh, my God. "I didn't even know you was gonna be here. "This is so impressive, Barack. "How did you do all of this?" "Well, started from the bottom, now we're here." (CHUCKLES) Then they just go at it. But they stay like who they are. You know what I mean? 'Cause I can't picture Barack and Michelle being ghetto. They don't do ghetto sex talk. She say First Lady talk. "Barack, did you eat your carrots?" "Yeah, I ate my carrots. I ate my zucchini." Somebody might... An imaginary person walk by. She be like, "Wait, wait, somebody coming. "Okay, keep going." "Okay." Barack do the same thing. "Wait, wait. I hear somebody coming." "Who?" "Me." (MOANS) Fifty-six, fifty-seven. I'm done. But now, man. We get into these relationships. And some of y'all wish y'all was in another person's shoes. I'm gonna give y'all relationship advice. I was married for 16 months. I know what I'm talking about. Listen. Everybody always wish that they have what somebody else have. Single people want to be in relationships. And people who are in relationships want to be single. How many times, ladies, were you with your girlfriend, and you saw your girlfriend kiss her husband, Joe, before she got in the car and y'all drove off to the club? And your girlfriend, you said to your girlfriend, "Oh, my God. You and Joe. "Y'all look so beautiful. Y'all are so blessed. "I wish I had that." And what's she saying? "Bitch, you want Joe, you can have Joe. "I don't want that motherfucker Joe. "You know how many people had to die tonight "just so I can get out of the house? "He don't know where we going." (LAUGHS) Dudes, we do the same thing. We forget we in relationships. We wake up and get reminded. We be like... "Oh, this bitch still here. Oh, my God. "Oh, I got kids, too. Hey, Dequarius. What's up?" (LAUGHS) And here's another problem. Nobody tell the truth anymore. That's what's wrong with dating. Nobody tell the truth. We went out last night, heard this dude talking to this girl, "Yeah, so I'm an astronaut." And her ass was like, "For real? Oh, my God! "I never met an astronaut." And I don't hate on nobody, but I couldn't hold my tongue. I was like, "Bitch, he got dreadlocks. He ain't no damn astronaut." They don't even let them take the test. What the fuck? But the trick is to not find somebody crazy. I think that's what we all look for. Yeah. And what the problem is, is now medication is so good, you can't tell who crazy or not. People got real good health insurance, and now it ain't until nine months later when y'all done moved in together, when you find out this motherfucker is bonkers and you can't even break up, 'cause they're on your car insurance and you lose your couple's discount. It'll be somebody going out, and, ladies, y'all know how y'all always look for a man. But you say, "It's girls' night. Girls' night! Ooh-ooh!" "Girls' night. Happy birthday, bitch. "Happy birthday, bitch. Girls' night! Ooh-ooh!" Somebody in girls' night got a man. But they always gotta act like they don't have a man or it's not going well 'cause they don't want to piss off the rest of their friends. And their friends test them all the time. "Girls' night! Ooh-ooh! Hey, what's up with you and Rick?" "Rick? Fuck Rick. Fuck Rick. Girls' night! Ooh-ooh!" And, ladies, some of y'all ain't dated in a long time, because when the dude even tell you something crazy right off the jump, you act like you didn't hear it. And then you find yourself stuck. This dude tell you, "Yeah, so, I hate vegetables and sunshine." You be like, "Excuse me." "Who was that, girl?" "I don't know, but he is a cute ass vampire, bitch. "I'm gonna do that." Ooh-ooh! Dude tell you he crazy. Now, ladies... Fellas, now when we date crazy girls, we know. We know. We know you crazy. We try to find somebody that's not more than 30% crazy. We're looking for that 20% crazy. That type of crazy that you forget they're crazy. It's not until it's their birthday, you taking them out on their birthday, "Happy birthday." "Thank you." "Brought you to your favorite restaurant." "Cheesecake Factory." "You know what you want?" "Chicken Madeira." And you pull out her chair, and right before she sit down she go... And what do you say, fellas? You don't want to mess up the night, but you say it to yourself, "That's right, this bitch crazy as fuck. "I forgot all about that shit." But the number one reason why dudes stay with crazy girls, crazy girls have the best sex. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) Look at all the ladies clap... "Shit crazy as fuck. Bam." Make some noise, fellas, if you ever had sex with a crazy girl. (MEN CHEERING) Y'all know what I'm talking about. They be sitting on top of you saying that crazy bipolar shit, you think you can die at any minute, but your dick is rock hard 'cause you excited. You be saying, "Lord, please, just let me nut before she kills me. "Oh, my God." And they be sitting on top of you saying crazy shit, (SHARP VOICE) "Look at me! (DEMONIC VOICE) "Don't look at me! (SHARP VOICE) "Look at me! (DEMONIC VOICE) "Don't look at me!" (EVIL LAUGHTER) You like, "Oh, shit!" But you ain't no punk, you try to get one in. You be like... My name is Finesse Mitchell. I love you, Atlanta. Thank you very much. Peace out. (HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING) It's your boy Red Grant about to go in and blast this bitch, man, turn up. About that life, man. For the Shaq All Stars. Let's go, man. (HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING) Look how I look like an old nigger do. ♪ Hey, hey, the blues are all right ♪ (HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING) Ah! Dolphin. You didn't know a big nigger could move like that. I'm out of breath like a motherfucker. Look. (LAUGHS) Coming to the stage, ladies and gentlemen, all the way from DC but lives in LA right now. Red Grant! Give it up, y'all. (HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING) (LAUGHS) You gotta have your spirit right to laugh. Some of y'all ain't got your spirit right, right now. Some of y'all are gonna die angry, nigger. Gonna still be in your casket, mad as a motherfucker, like this that bullshit. You better have fun today 'cause you don't know if you're gonna be here tomorrow, nigger. You fuck around, don't have fun today, wake up in the morning, be in front of God, he be like, "Should have had fun last night." ♪ Gold all in my chain I saw that song right there make a thug nigger dance at the club last night. You know thugs don't dance. Thugs be thugs. Nigger was in there like, "I don't give a fuck. "I'll kill everybody in this bitch. "Niggers in here dancing and shit. "Nigger, I get turned up, nigger. "I don't dance, I don't give a fuck what they play. "I don't dance, nigger. (BLUES PLAYING) "I ain't know they was gonna play this, though." I said, "I bet this nigger better not get up." The nigger was like... (HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC STOPS) I said, "Is this nigger's arm out?" You know this is your gaydar if your arm out. You're gay for however long your arm out. And we in Atlanta, nigger. Gay dudes is recruiting, nigger. You better get your shit tight. Some of y'all doing gay shit and you don't even know it. Some of y'all fellas letting women stick their finger in your ass. And you don't think it's gay. Oh, it's gay, nigger. You a butthole bandit, nigger. I don't even let women lick my ass. No more, I don't let that shit happen. Two times when my shit was perpendicular. She had to go get that shit. My girl tried to make me gay the other night. 'Cause my wife do crazy shit now. She want to test me. She's trying to see if I'm gay. No, I'm not. I knew she was trying to make me gay, 'cause she was jerking my ding-a-ling. But she was jerking it towards me. No. No, no. Uh-uh! I looked at my dick, I said, "Nigger, you better not." My dick was like, "I'm about to bust." And he shot one out at me. And I was like, "No! Not my face." I was gay for three seconds, nigger. But my wife make me feel good. Before I came here, she don't let me go out with my balls on heavy. She keeps them on flat, nigger. That's what's wrong with some of you women. You let your man go out with his balls on heavy. Yeah, heavy nuts, nigger. Nigger, my shit stays on flat. If a girl asks me for some, I tell her straight up, "Only thing you can get is air and opportunity." I'll be saying crazy shit to my wife. 'Cause she gave me head the other day, it was early in the morning. You ever get that, Shaq, that early morning head? Before you wake up? Where your body be asleep. But your ding-a-ling be woke. Ha-ha-ha. You always do the same shit when you realize you're getting early morning head. You be like this, "Oh, shit. "Damn, what did a nigger do to deserve this one? "It ain't even Father's Day." You start pointing your toes and shit. You ever swim, nigger? You ever swim? When you getting your balls sucked, fellas... Feel me, fellas, feel me. Don't leave me up here by myself. When you're getting your balls sucked, you want that shit to sound like this. (SLURPING) You want it to sound like a kitten drinking milk. (SLURPING) You never want to hear this coming off your balls, do you? (SLURPING POP) (SLURPING POP) (SLURPING POP) (SCREAMS) The sperm be in your sac like, "What the fuck is going on? "She's trying to suck us through the balls. "I'm almost through the scrotum, nigger." "This is not our exit." Don't you wish that Allstate insurance man could jump out the closet, when you're getting your ball suck fucked up? Right when it hurt, you're like... (SOBS) "I need help!" And nigger be like, ""Are your balls in good hands?" I asked my wife the other day, she talking about something. "It's harder to be a woman than it is to be a man." No, it's not. Ladies like, "Yeah, it is." No, it's not. Fellas, stick with me on this. It's harder being us, ain't it? (MEN AGREEING) You know why it's harder being us? 'Cause we live with a fucking maniac down there. That nigger's a maniac. And you know he's a maniac 'cause some mornings you wake up, that nigger already be up. Talking shit to you. Like, "Nigger, you still asleep? "Nigger, I've been up for two fucking hours, nigger! I'm a maniac." And you be like, "Nigger, what's your problem, nigger?" "What's my problem? I love bad bitches, that's my fucking problem. "Yeah, I got a fucking problem." I pulled my joint out the other day, my dick was looking mad at me. 'Cause he got personality, I pulled him out, and I'm looking at him.

He was like, "Nigger, you married. "She ain't put no ring on me." I was like, "I got some kids, man. "I can't be doing that shit every day." He was like, "Kids? Nigger, you telling me about kids, nigger? "I'm living with a million little kids inside me right now, nigger, "ready to bust out, nigger." Now I have to check his ass, I was like, "Nigger, "you could have been on a different body. "I take care of you, nigger." He was like, "Nigger, you what?" I said, "I take care of you. Do I put you in skinny jeans?" He was like, "No." I said, "Nigger, I saved you." He was like, "Bitch ass nigger, you ain't saved me. "Nigger, I saved you." I said, "Nigger, how you saved me?" He was like, "Remember that time you was getting ready to put me in that dirty girl "and I ain't get hard?" I was like, "Yeah, yeah, you're right." I had to gear that nigger down and shit. "You good, nigger. I gotta put you up, though, nigger." He was like, "You gonna put me up? "Nigger, I'm a maniac. I live beside two nuts and an asshole." "Get back in there." I'm happy in life, nigger, that's what I wanna be. I always wanted to be since I was little. But I wasn't happy all my life, but now I am, nigger. I'm getting turned up for the rest of my life. Turn up, nigger. I don't know if y'all know what "turn up" is, but get turned up, nigger. Shit, Shaq and them know. I go to the club, I get turned up with them niggers. Turned all the way up. You didn't turn up, nigger. Nigger, not only do I get turned up, I turn their bottles up, nigger. I turn their tabs all the way up. Nigger, Shaq calls me "The Pourer." 'Cause I pour the drinks. And I'm the poorest nigger in the VIP. My favorite song now is... ♪ Pour it up, pour it up, watch the bill turn up ♪ Champagne costs 1,000 bills It ain't my money ♪ Patron shots all in their grill it ain't my money (VOCALIZING) ♪ All I do is shine 'cause the money ain't mine ♪ But if you turn a nigger's bill up, you better leave early. Them niggers know I left last night at 1:30. 'Cause by the time they get the tab, I'm already in the cab, nigger. (LAUGHS) Shaq's ass called me this morning, he said, "Red Grant, "my motherfucking bill was $22,000." I said, "Nigger, ball so hard. That shit crazy." "Turn up, nigger, about that life." At the end of the day, I didn't start saying anything. ♪ Look me in my face, I ain't got no worries ♪ I wasn't saying anything. ♪ I woke up in a new Bugatti I said, "Nigger, you woke up in a new Buick, nigger." Throw a Buick on her, nigger. That nigger Ne-Yo came in the club the other day, tried to outball me. This nigger coming to me like, "Red Grant, what the fuck up, nigger? "We about to ball so hard, that shit is crazy." I'm like, "Okay, okay." I go over to this nigger's section. He order 6000 ones. 6000. He take 300 of the ones and throws that shit in the air and makes it rain. And it rained on me. And I walked into the rain, nigger. To make a long story short, I left Ne-Yo's section with 392 ones. I was picking that nigger's money up singing his songs. (LAUGHS) ♪ Grab somebody's money, tell him hey ♪ Give me all your shit tonight ♪ I just recently went and saw Prince. The Artist. And I don't know if any of y'all have been to see Prince ever in your life. But it's an amazing concert. How many people saw Prince before? Okay. (AUDIENCE CHEERS) And my wife, I love her to death, but she's a hater, but she ain't a hater. She always telling me what I should not do. Like, "Don't do it." I'm like, "Let me live, man, I'm grown as a motherfucker. "Just let me live." So I go and buy a whole purple outfit. So Prince is a magician. Anybody who been to a Prince concert know he disappears. "Purr," nigger. And when he reappeared, he reappeared in a billow of smoke. That's a big word, nigger. "Billow." That's a lot of smoke. And I could see Prince, but I really couldn't see him. 'Cause he was peeking in out of the smoke. And all of a sudden I heard Prince say... ♪ I never meant to cause you any problems Problems, problems, problems ♪ And I stood up, gay as a motherfucker. But my arm was in, nigger. ♪ I never meant to cause you any pain ♪ And I did my arm like this, I don't know why. But everybody around me did the shit, too. ♪ Somebody needs some type of loving Loving, loving, loving ♪ And it was like the lights went down on everybody in the place but me and Prince. And I looked at my wife and my wife is like, "Don't do it." I was like, "Let me live." ♪ I only want to see you laughing in the purple rain ♪ (ALL SINGING) I see you know the song, huh? That's what Prince said to me, big man, "I see you know the song." And in my outer thug body I was like, "Yeah, I know the song, Prince." But in the inside I was like... (SCREAMS) That was in the inside, though. And he ducked back in the smoke. And when he ducked back in the smoke, a girl beside me was like, "I love you, Prince." And when he ducked back out, he thought I had said it. And Prince said this shit to me, some real shit, he was like, "Do you and your girl want to come backstage?" And I looked at my wife and she was like, "Don't do it." "Yeah, we wanna come back." But I don't meet stars good. First time I met Shaq, nigger, I practiced for two weeks in the mirror. He invited me to Miami. I was in the mirror like, "What the fuck up, Shaq? "Ball so hard, that shit's crazy, nigger." My wife kept saying, "Don't do it." "Bitch, I'm about that life." But when I got to Miami and Shaq came in the room, my body got hot. And he walked up on me, he was like, "What's up, Red Grant?" And I was like, "Hey, Shaquille." (PANTING) So I ain't know how the fuck I was gonna meet Prince, nigger. I told my wife I'm gonna sing to him. She was like, "Don't do it. Please, don't do it." And I had my song and everything. I had my song. I was like, "Fuck it, I'm gonna sing." ♪ Don't have to be beautiful to turn me on ♪ I was gonna start right there. So I'm in that bitch, practicing. All of a sudden I see Prince's billow come into the room. And my body got hot. And what I didn't tell y'all that night, Prince had on like an all-white blouse. A blouse, nigger. With some white leggings. And some white furry boots that every time he walked, they lit up like LA Gear. And when he came in the room, my body got hot and everything slowed down. And I could hear John say, (VERY SLOWLY) "Prince, "this is Red Grant. "Red Grant, this is Prince." And everything sped up and I can hear Prince say, "How are you doing, Red?" And I don't know why I started talking like Prince, but I was like, "How are you doing, Mr. Prince?" He was like, "I'm doing fine." I was like, in my head... ♪ Don't have to be beautiful to turn me on ♪ But when I went to speak, I was like, "You're beautiful." I'm Red Grant. Enjoy the rest of y'all night. (HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING) Ladies and gentlemen, Shaquille O'Neal. Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Shrek. He did a wonderful job. Great job, Shrek. What the fuck is you doing with this pleather-ass blue jean jacket on, homie? And go cut that fucking uncle-touch-me moustache off. You look a goddamn mess. Yo, this is your boy, aka the next big thing, aka Mr. Uncircumcised. Look, don't judge me. Don't do that. When we showed up, Jesus was on this chain, before he said, "Get the fuck off me with your poor ass chain." This shit was purple, then it was yellow, now it's gold. What you do, just breathe on it and it change color? You got here looking like a goddamn cab driver. What is your hat? Why does your hat look damp right now? Yo, what up? This is Finesse Mitchell. I come from a good home. I know my father, so I ain't hostile. I tried to sell drugs once, but it didn't work out. It be getting chilly at night. So now, I'm doing this shit. That's right, I do comedy. Shit worked out for me. White TV. Good credit. I'll holler at you, Mama. Peace out. Did you just get free from slavery talking like that? I don't understand a word you said with your skinny ass. You lock you out the house, nigger, you slide up under the goddamn door with your Jiminy Cricket built body having ass out here. Y'all give it up for the Planters Peanut man. On the Shaq All Star Comedy Jam. And for 15 cents a day, you can feed this nigger. Help him out. Yo, my name is Lavar. I'm representing all the niggers with hairlines way back here. Now all you niggers with them big-ass faces that look like you're knocking on the door through a fucking peephole, when I see you, I'm smacking the shit out of you with your panoramic view head ass nigger. I'm about to murder all these niggers out here. And it's going the fuck down. Your boy, Red Grant. Gap tooth stand-up. All gap tooth people in the world know what I'm talking about. Gap teeths whistles for no reason. We whistle for no reason. Y'all give it up for Lavar looking like a 47-year-old 13-year-old. (ALL LAUGHING) What did you say? I'm sorry, I don't understand the negro talk of America. I'm gonna stand in the background and I'll be cheering. I'll be holding a flag and eating crumpets. Thank you. Shorty, shorty look like Mike Epps on Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. (ALL LAUGHING) If you won't take your Crocodile Hunter drinking ass... Hell, who the fuck is this? Can you even fit it in the door, nigger? You ready? I'm ready. You ready to go to work? It's showtime! It's showtime! Can you dig it? God damn. What's up, bud? What's up? You ready to go to work? Yes, sir. I'm gonna need one of these. You need one for your kids? Yeah. A.N.T. Farm. Disney. Got you. I'm about to kick Shaq's ass, real talk. Put this on camera. Man bought a new shirt, looking like a motherfucking mortician. (ALL LAUGHING) My God, you're huge. If I marry the Queen, will I become the King of England? No, they would never let a black man become the King of England. Yeah, but I'm the Shaq man. You're the Shaq man. You're already a king, Shaq. Look at you. That was Shaq. Why the fuck is all your security shorter than you? I saw Shaq walk in the club with security. It looked like a big dick with two balls. Walking in the goddamn club. It's ridiculous. See, this nigger look like Shaq if he got sick and shit. (ALL LAUGHING) Gained a lot of fucking weight. I shook this nigger's hand and got diabetes. This nigger better lose this foot. Just go ahead and swallow this nigger. Faison, get out of the way. So they can see the first K-Swiss ever made. Anybody who know about style, they gonna look at these and know what these are. And that's not you, nigger. This nigger's jacket is made out of fabric softener. If I stab him, a chicken is gonna fly out of his goddamn belly. Live.
