Where is it? Where is it? Wake up! Emil. THE STRANGE CASE OF THE CLAUSTROPHOBIC GHOST Those seeds have already sprouted in the nursery. Yes... No. We need to transplant them. We're going to run out of time. I don't know why you think I'm exaggerating. No. Look... What about you brother? Niko, you won't make it to school. He didn't sleep well. Elena, your son needs help. He's a bit crazy. What? Don't talk like that about your brother. And don't call me Elena, I'm Mom. Now eat. The one that needs help is you, buddy. I think Tuesday would be perfect because... Mom, why did we have to move so far away from dad... ...and from everything? Give me two minutes, Sebas? I'll call you back. Honey. Look at me. Look, I know it's tough. Dad and I are giving each other a break. And that changes many things. But we are going to be fine. Hey, kids, come on. Let's go to school. It's going to be OK. Run, run, run! Come on Emil, your teeth! "And that's how I found out that 'love' comes up in all songs and movies. And it can be explained chemically when there's an increase in dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin." "The effect of love is similar to the effect of consuming drugs. It's like sugar. You can get high." Did you write that? Well, only this last phrase, my dad told me that one. Do you have a question for Nikolaj? He's going to think you have a brain damage. Ximena? What's the name of the main substance? The one that is generated by love. The one with the brain damage is that kid. Dopamine. Thanks, Nikolaj. Alright, see you next week. Please, study. And that's how we started losing the battle against the machines. We all had been captured by them. She is Ximena. The girl who participated in class after my essay. In the world of weird specimens, this one looks even weirder. She uses objects from last century. There is something about her. Something mysterious. Interesting way of seeing love. Much colder. More realistic, I would say. Everything has a scientific explanation. Nice camera. Looks like a time machine. Thanks. This camera is unique. It's made up with old pieces. Recycling is good for the planet. Yes... Is it a lighter? It's not just that. It's a light in my darkness. OK... And... "Aura," what's it about? It's a horror story. Horror. Not a fan of that genre. I already have trouble sleeping. Why can't you sleep? Well... When I lived in Brazil, there were nights I couldn't sleep at all. You're from Brazil? No, I was born in Sinaloa, but I lived for two years in Bahia. My parents, well, my mother is a researcher, anthropologist. But why couldn't you sleep? Because I was scared. Because of the horror stories. No, scared of the dark. But I got over it. And you? Something very strange happens to me. Nikolaj! And who is that? Well, that's my brother. I wish to have brothers. You don't know what you're saying. Having a brother is like having a dysfunctional copy of oneself. Do you like science fiction? Well, I like making videos. Who taught you? By myself. Well, my dad helped me. Do you and your dad get along? I've always wondered if a camera can capture the occult. What do you mean by the occult? Spirits, ghosts. Ghosts... Stop reading "Aura." Well, do you believe in ghosts? Are you serious? I've seen them. And I know what they're capable of. And what are they capable of? It depends of the type of ghost. There are different types of ghosts? Well, nice to meet you. Nikolaj. I'm intrigued by your design. Alright. Nice to meet you. I'm Ximena. I'm sorry. Right. Can you keep a secret? Sure. I think there's a ghost living in my closet. Hey, wait. Pablo, you don't understand. The foundation needs me. If you want, send me Niko for a while. - It's only been two months. - But it's not easy to adapt, If you want, send me Niko for a while. I need more time. I also need some money. What are you doing? Are you giving me the cold shoulder? Go to sleep. Nikolaj! Niko. Niko, wake up. What? What's wrong? What? The closet? Something strange is going on in this room. Well, welcome to the loony club. - Can I sleep with you? - No. Fine. Emil. Emil, wait. Where are you going? I'll wait for you with Elena. Don't shut the... Get out! - Emil! - What was that? Did you see anything? Nothing. Did you hear something? - What? No. - The voice. No. You didn't see the light? No. What do we do now, loony? Sleep with mom. - Agree. - Let's go. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. It's just that, for some reason, she knows about ghosts. Ghosts? But she's a girl. So what? She lived in Brazil. And so what? Is she going to play soccer with the ghost or what? No. She apparently had some encounters with ghosts. What's her name? Ximena. Ximena! Hi. This is my brother Emil. Hi, Emil. You scared me with your shout. Nice to meet you. I'm Ximena. Did you tell her about the noises we hear? What? The noises I was telling you about. What were those noises like? - Well... - The light you saw. Light? The room lit up as if it were daytime. And what did you do? We slept with mom, obviously. No, not me, just him! But what do we need to do there? Of course. You should've just asked who it is. Why they are there or how they got in your closet. - Just tell them that... - Yes. That's why she wouldn't have done anything either. Don't get discouraged champ. Alright. I want to show you both something. Emil, if you don't talk to me directly, I won't be able to help you at all. Understood? Let's go. And... What are we doing here? It's down there where you can find the biggest number of ghosts in the city. The subway? Yes. - Amazing, right? - I don't understand. Many people have died here. This level is below the buried. The underworld, as the ancient cultures believed. Am I being clear? It makes sense. There are several types of ghosts. Some are friendly, some hostile, there are the ones that need help. And others that haven't realized they are already dead. Are they dead? We have to know what kind of ghosts is in your closet. ENTRANCE First, there are the mischievous ones. Those ones were very comfortable here before they died. That's why they don't want to leave. They're always teasing the living, playing tricks on them. Do you think there is a mischievous one in your closet? I don't think so. I don't feel like they're being playful. The second kind are the absent minded. Those guys haven't realized they are dead. How can they not know they are dead? According to them, they just fell asleep. So when they wake up, they get up. And do the same things over and over again without notice. Are you OK? Yes. Sorry. Let's go We're still missing the most important kind of ghosts. How do you know so much about ghosts? In comparison, these are the ones who make you shiver. Because they feel pain, confusion, anger, and dreadfulness. To them death is... ...a problem, an imposition. These ghosts are the ones who usually have the most aggressive and destructive attitudes. And which type are these? These are... the bleeders. They're the ones who wonder around bleeding and dismembered. I would like to know who came up with the name for each type of ghost. They're so basic, lacking of... Look, in this group you can find those who died in a violent way or those who took their own life because of a trauma or illness. And are these dangerous? Hey, kids, go away. You can't be here. Go away. What's wrong with this? I don't know, she's crazy. - What did you say? - Sorry, I didn't say anything. - Sorry, Mrs. - Miss. Let's go! Elena? Hello! Have you seen what time it is? I called the school. They told me you left with a girl who is known for being... Good evening, Ma'am. I'm Ximena. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I'm Elena. Your sons invited me over... Because we have a school project. And well, the teachers said that the teams had to be mixed. What is that project about? About... CLIMATE CHANGE climate change. Good. I like that school. It's a good theme. My mom is an expert in that subject. Well, I'll set the table so you can work. No, mom, easy. We are going to work in my room. Alright then. Emil, the piano teacher is here. Hurry up! - Ready? - I'll see you in a moment guys! - OK, Mom. - Ready. Yeah, that's it. It's always like that. As if they're looking for something through my clothes. The ghost did this? Yeah. Look, Nikolaj. Yes? And what is this? It's an "abichaespíritu." In other words, a soul catcher. It was a gift from my witch friends in El Salvador. Wow! Can I see? Don't touch it. El Salvador? Didn't you say you lived in Brazil? - Let's concentrate. - OK. Do they also come out at daytime? Day... ...or night. They really don't care about time. And how are we going to summon it? What a mess! Are you sure it's going to work? I'm just saying that maybe it's not working. Don't you ever close that door again. Understood? What's happening, Nikolaj? The closet. I don't see anything. It's looking at us right now. Say something! Alright. Who are you? Who are you to speak to me? Some kind of insect? No, I'm just a kid. Well, in between boy and... You must have a name. Nikolaj. Nikolaj. What kind of ridiculous name is that? Nikolaj? What is he saying? He's making fun of my name. It's a very common name in Denmark. Have you ever been to Denmark? Ask him his name, or if he knows he's dead. Excuse me. Are you aware of you're dead? Are you mocking me? Of course not, sir! I don't mock anybody! No. No, no, no. Go back into the closet! Don't tell him to leave! - He's come out of the closet! - Where is he? He's right in front of us. Is there anyone else here? Yes, my friend Ximena. Tell her to stop all the fuss. He says you need to calm down. Ask him what he's doing here. We need more information. May I ask you what you're doing in my closet? No! What are you doing in my room? Did you, by any chance, leave something pending? - Pending? - Yes. My friend Ximena says that some dead people come back here to finish what they left pending... But... the dead one here is you, Nikolaj. What did he say? That we are the dead ones. Well, just me. Likewise. And thanks for inviting Ximena. Sure. Can you get in the back seat? Yes. Take care. - Bye, bye. - See you. Are you going to tell me what happened? It's a long story, Mom. Would you like to live with your dad for a while? I think so. Oh. I think it's going to rain. Let's go inside. Come on, Emil. OK. I'm coming. Ugly and horrendous? Does he have eyes, mouth? What clothes was he wearing? I'm not sure. I think he didn't have any. Just... his eyes and his mouth moved like smoke but with energy. - How? - I got a video. Wait. Plasma. That's what it was. That's what ghosts are made of. Oh, plasma. Do you want to know what I realized? - What? - What? You and Ximena think I'm stupid. You both agreed to make me believe a bunch of lies. Ignorance is bliss. If you prefer not to believe us, well... it's better for you. See you around. I think I understand now why you hate having a brother. Are you OK? I'm going to live with my dad for a while. Why? Where? Querétaro. I see. You know what? I used to sleep here, in this place. I came here before you. Since when? Since before you appeared. Give me back my room, or you will pay for it. This has to be a mistake. We bought this apartment from a couple with no kids. I don't get along well. And I don't understand why you are in my room. Well, this is my house. That's impossible. I want my privacy back. I can't do anything about it. I live here with my mom and my brother. You have to leave. Whether you like it or not, by ten o'clock tonight. You should be out of my room forever! But I'm just a kid. Where do you expect me to go? Nikolaj. Are you alright? Everything will be alright. Elena's son is leaving. Yes, he told me. I have a plan. Oh, no. - Give... Give him the... - Yes. Thank you. - Take care. - I will. Bye. Kids, your tickets! Hey, kids, your tickets! Your tickets! NEXT DEPARTURE QUERÉTARO Niko! Nikolaj. What are you doing here? Don't go, Niko. The ghost needs your help, that's why he comes to you. He doesn't. He never asked for it. He just threatened me. He's disoriented. He's scared. Hey, are you staying with your girlfriend or getting on? Let's go. Don't worry, Elena, I understand perfectly why you're upset. But also remember, when we were young. What did she say? He's fine, he's calm. I'll get him over there by six. No! At eight, please. They are saying that if I can drop him off at seven. Alright, 6:30. Sure. Everything is OK, Elena. Take care. Thank you. - Hi, Mom. - Nikolaj. What did you do? Did you talk to your father? Yes, he told me that... ...whatever makes me happy. Oh, your dad... We're going to talk about this tonight and tell Emil that what he did was also very wrong. Yes. See you. Thanks. Don't do anything like that again. Understood? Your mother was very worried and upset. I understand her. And you and I are going to have a talk. Yes, Mom. I'm sorry. We will never do it again. We are going to my room. Come. Thanks, Mom. Thank you. Don't touch anything, please. Can I? Yes. Whose is this? My dad's. "V, C, G..." Victor? No. Vido. Yugoslavian for David. One of these days I'll explain everything. I've been thinking about what the nightly visitor said. He said a bunch of nonsense. Are you completely sure that the building you live in is new? Well, actually... it was built several years ago. What if there was an old building before which got demolished in order to build the one you're living in now? It makes sense. But he said he has always lived there and that is his room. So... ...what if he died there? Maybe he's an Aztec. What? Aztecs lived there before. We know that. But he speaks Spanish instead of Nahuatl. Well, time doesn't exist for the dead. Months, years can go by, even centuries. DAD DIED HERE Well, he's not an Aztec. See? I told you... I found something! Come! More than 300 buildings completely destroyed. More than 700 ended up in ruins. Hundreds of buildings about to collapse. 7:19:42 am, Mexico City time. There is still a little movement happening, but we can take it calmly now. Let's wait for a moment to continue... September 19th and 20th of 1985. When was the first time you saw the ghost? It was... the 15th. You said that time doesn't exist for the dead. So neither exist dates. Not for the dead, no. But they do for the living. Ghosts don't just appear, they respond when they are summoned. For example, when there's an important date, an anniversary. We remember the dead. But who summoned him? Well, we don't know that. We need to find out if where we live there was another building in 1985. Let's see if Mom or Dad know something about it. Or your neighbors. Let's ask them over the weekend. Well, if my brother is still alive. I'm kidding. Easy! If he comes back, tell him what you found out. What if all of this has nothing to do with him? We have nothing to lose. And I think that it has something to do with him. Let's say I can feel this kinds of things. Maybe the janitor knows more about it because I was in Denmark. Although your dad, who was a student at that time, lived here, in Mexico City, said it was awful. Yes, it was strong. Yes. But it's a difficult topic to talk about during dinner. I don't want us to have nightmares. Yes, its just that... Emil. Let's go to bed. - We'll talk about it tomorrow. - OK. Come on. This door... ...is a piece of trash! You're still there. I warned you, Danish boy. I'm half Mexican and half Danish. - But more Mexican... - So what? You're an intruder. Wait. What's wrong with you? You never told me what happened to you. Who are you to talk to me like that? Nobody! You don't even exist! Of course I exist. The one who doesn't exist is you. I don't... remember what it means to exist. I know what happened to you. An earthquake hit and half the city collapsed. Many people were trapped. That explains a lot of things. You have something pending. And I... ...I can help you. I think you're right. I should help him. I'm going to interview the neighbors tomorrow. Do you want to come with me? On Saturdays I have breakfast with my aunt and uncle, but... ...I could come afterwards. Ximena, I... ...I never... I've never recorded a message like this for someone. And this doesn't mean anything. It's just that... I'm an idiot. IF YOU ARE STILL AWAKE TURN THAT THING OFF AND GO TO BED OK, MOM Are you alright? I can't find it. I can't find it. Where did I leave it? I can't find it. Where is it? - Good morning. - Hey. We are working on a school project. We want to know if you lived here in 1985. What kind of school project? Well, it's about the 1985 earthquake. I can't help you. I moved in two years ago. OK. Thanks. And don't come knocking like that again. I'm sorry. Good morning. We are working on a school project... and we want to know if you lived on this street in 1985. Yes, we remember that there was a building over there. It collapsed because of the earthquake. Do you know if that building collapsed as well? I don't remember. To be honest, I was on acid at that time. "On acid"? Good luck, kids. Look! Good morning, Miss. What do you want? Excuse me. We just want to know if you lived here before 1985? Why do you want to know that? The 1985 earthquake. Do you remember anything? We live in that building. The blue one. There was a huge crash. After that we were breathing a lot of dust for months. Was anyone living there? A friend or anyone you know? Why do you want to know that? Because our teacher asked us. Yes, our teacher. Your teacher. That was a long time ago. They aren't good memories. It was a tragedy. After that, nothing was the same. Who are you? Why are you here? Go away! Go home! Get lost! - But Miss... - Go away! Fine. I think you must stay here. But I didn't say anything bad. But you almost did. If you don't trust, why do you tell everything to Ximena? For some reason she is an expert in ghosts. And I can trust her... Do you like her, right? Hello, guys. What are you talking about? We found something. Really? That woman I mean, girl, she's our lead. There's something about her. - Right, Emil? - Yes. Maybe... we can get more information before she comes back. What? Let's go! Can we do it tomorrow? I don't have much time. Look, there are only three possibilities. The first one is that the lady was asleep, and we woke her up with the doorbell. And she attacked us with her broom. The second one is that she's taking a shower. Although this lady doesn't seem to shower daily. And the third one? That she's not home. Let's go. What's your plan? You didn't walk until here just to say "Hi." Who's there? Good morning. We are your neighbors. Neighbors. Yes, well, we wanted to talk to you. Really? I don't get many visitors anymore. You are so kind to come and visit me. Come in, please. Would you like something to drink? No, thank you. Yes, a glass of water, please. I'll be right back. Come in. Take a seat, please. AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF TEEN SUICIDES Hey, here! Hey. Come. - Come. - What are you doing here? Come and sit, now! She's coming. Here it is. Thank you. And what brings you here? And where's the other lady? What lady? The one who was sweeping the porch this morning. Marcela. My daughter. I don't speak to her. I am upset with her as well as with my other children. They all agreed behind my back. They want to sell the house. What are they going to do with me? Yes, sure. Well, your daughter, Marcela... lived here with you when the earthquake happened? Do you remember? It happened in 1985. I remember. We all saw it. It seemed to have collapsed completely. Under the smoke there was a mountain of debris. What a terrible thing! Can you tell us what happened with the building around the corner? Did you see when it collapsed? The building around the corner? It just recently was cleaned up. Did they all die? No. Many of them had gone to work. Or to school. What hurt me the most was a boy, a friend of Marcela, who lived there. They went to school together. He lived in number 404. He was a good boy. The fourth floor. What happened to him? The same that happened to all of them. There was no way of rescuing him. It was so sad. Especially for Marcela. And... for several weeks she could barely eat. She cried a lot. I think she loved him very much. Well, we have to go now, thanks for everything. There she is. - Mom? - You'll see how crazy she gets. Mom, I need you to start packing this house. Mr. Gomez is coming and I need it to be fairly presentable. Maybe it's best if we leave. No, please, don't leave me with her. Why are you here? Snooping around? What's that thing buzzing around? Are you going to ignore me forever? And you, insects! - We are working... on a project. - On a project. I don't believe you, liars! Get out of here! Get out! Marcela, they are my guests. So now you do listen. They have to leave now! We have to leave now. Thanks. It's obvious. Marcela is keeping him here. But, then... ...Poncho is another type of ghost. Poncho? How do you know his name If he didn't remember who he was? Because I read it. - Where? - Oh, yeah! Look, it was in one of the bedrooms. No! Stop, humans! Let's read it the three of us at the same time. Then we'll get copies and we'll give it back. OK? Let's go to the club. Yes, let's go. Club? Where does it say his name is Poncho? Look. Here. OK. "June 14th, 1984. I haven't felt very good today. Marcela helped me a lot. She's a great friend." "July 7th, 1985. We have a new classmate. Her name is..." It's crossed out. "I like her, but I think she hates me." Someone crossed out this name in the diary. And did it with rage. Look, he even tore out the pages. "July 16th, 1985. I'll write a letter to tell her I can't sleep because I'm thinking about her. The only thing I want is to be right next to..." Crossed out name. "I wish I could hug and kiss her. I think she likes me." I wonder how this diary ended up with Marcela. I don't think he gave it to her. I think she took it. I don't know. Why do you think so? Because the last entry is dated September 18, 1985. One day before the earthquake. But... I don't think so. Look at this, "Tomorrow would be the day. The letter is ready and tomorrow I'll give it to..." Crossed out name. That's what's keeping Poncho here. That's what he left unfinished. The only person who knows is... The lady with the broom. Marcela. No. Someone else knows about this. Do you think Marcela already noticed I stole the diary? She always had it with her, right? Yes, most of the time. We should come up with a plan so she gives us the information we need. The letter and who it was for. Easy, easy. Yes, but... something's wrong. What happened? Everything OK? Yeah, I'm alright. Well, but we don't know what she will do. Remember she's crazy. We have to find that letter. How do you know the letter hasn't been delivered? Because Poncho is still here. The worst of it is that I'm craving pie. There's some in the fridge. Well, then go for it. I'll wait here. You have something that belongs to me. Yes, but nothing really belongs to you anymore, Poncho. Yes... That's my name. Poncho. Yes, Poncho. I just need you to tell me her name and I can help you. Yes... Yes, Poncho. Where are you going? Poncho. Poncho? Yes... I'm weak. I barely have any energy left. I'll live here trapped. Without understanding anything. I can help you. I brought you this. Thank you. I don't like baseball but thank you. It's my favorite team. If you wear it, I'll be able to see you better. Thank you. You're welcome, Poncho. Where's the letter? The letter? I have to deliver it today. Tell me the name of the person who must read the letter. I forgot... The only thing I never forgot... ...was the color of her eyes. They change color with the light. From brown to green. Here, you don't feel cold... ...or hot... ...or any other feeling, you know? I used to sleep there. That was my space, my room. I know, Poncho, but you have to go now. And I'll deliver the letter for you. I get claustrophobic being locked in that closet. Why the closet? It has to do something with the past and movement of the earth. Sure you want to know? Not really. We won't see each other again. Can you feel it? I'm sorry for being so jerk to you. Don't worry, Poncho. I would've done the same. It was fun. It's time. We could've trusted each other. Like now. Like now. Claudia. Her name is Claudia. Claudia. Claudia. Claudia. There was no more pie left, but... Claudia. Her name is Claudia. In his diary, he mentions the name of his school. He was... ...around 15 years old in 1985. Which means that she was born in 1970 or 1971. It has to be one of these two. Maybe if we try to contact both of them. Let's send a message to both of them. Yes, yes. Good idea. Claudia, you may not know us, but... This is a message through time. You were and still are very important to someone. And we have news of what happened many years specifically when you were in middle school. It's like a letter that got lost. And we have it now. Please, contact us. We will be checking our e-mail first thing in the morning. What are you doing up so late? Niko? Your brother is too young, but you are not! Ximena. There are rules in this house. Now you're worried. If the only thing you care about is your foundation. That's why you abandoned Dad. Leave us alone. Send the e-mail. Why are you talking to me like that, Niko? You left him because he's a dreamer. I don't like the way you are talking to me. I don't like that tone and I'm not arguing with you. You know what? It's time you go spend some time with your dad. Let's go to sleep. VIDEO FOR CLAUDIA I promise you that if I get an answer, I'll let you know. But it's very likely that the real Claudia doesn't remember who Poncho is. Niko, the ghost won't rest until that letter gets delivered. We're together in this. After this you can do whatever you want, but look for other options. Buy some time. I'm still intrigued why you're so interested in all that involves ghosts, and helping the one that's in my closet. I'm looking for my father. Happy? OK. I couldn't say good bye to him. Besides that, I want to help the claustrophobic ghost. I understand. I thought you also did to help me. Bye, Ximena. Take care. Everything OK? Yes, I'll see you up there. Sure. Did you pack everything? - Yeah. - You aren't forgetting anything? No. You're going to be fine. I'll miss you a lot. Me too. - Hi, Dad! - Hi. - Hi. - How are you, Elena? Fine. He's ready. Champ. Everything cool? - Yes, everything's fine. - Good. Let me know when you get there, please. - Don't worry. - Don't run. - Everything will be fine. - Take care of him, Pablo. Yes, Elena. - Ready? - Let's go. You look good. - See you, Mom. - Let me help you. - Ready? - Yeah. What are you doing? I'm selecting some material because I want to make a video. If you want me to buy you a hard drive so you can back it up, let me know. Yes, thanks, Dad. Pass it! Here! - Dribble him! - Shoot! - I'm here! - Pass the ball! - Steel the ball! - Pass it to Emil! Shoot, Emil! - Good! - Well done, Emil! - I'm going to the restroom. - OK. Stop! What's wrong? You're scaring me. Look. Press play. Great visual effects. How did you do it? It's not an effect, Dad. Alright. Should I call your mom? Elena? They will give me a date. I believe in them. I turn in my receipt. They tell me the day they will pay. And that's the day I will make the transaction. But if they will not, what can I do? I'm sorry, but it does not depend on me. Listen to me, please. I got a steady job now. That's what you wanted. Yes, well, I am glad... Will you two stop? Why don't you say what you feel? Maybe tomorrow there's no time of saying it. It's just that, at your age, there are some things you don't understand. And you also have to know that sometimes it's too late. Too late is being dead. No, look, what your mom means is that this is not the place or time to talk about this. OK, well I need you to take me to school now. Now? We can go someplace later if you want, but this is urgent. It's a promise. Remember? Yes, son... Deal. - Thank you. - Are you coming with us? Come on, let's go. But can we go in my car? - Yes. - You drive. Well, let's go. Thanks! My things. - Ximena. - Did you read the message? Yes, I did. Let's go. Hello, kids! I guess you know why I'm here. Let's go! Hurry up! Let's go to the roof! Hello? Ximena? Emil? What? Hello! Niko, the lady is coming for us. Niko! Hello? This is just what I mean. It's been days with these stories. Mom, that's Emil's voice and he's not joking. Fine. Faster! Come on! Faster! Sure, faster! You are in serious trouble. The sing. Come with me. I'm so glad to see you. Where is... ...my diary! Here it is. Leave them alone, Marcela. Give us the letter and let us go. We are in their dimension on the edge of both universes. Don't go near them. - Open the door! - Dad! Mom! They can't hear you. - No one can! - Marcela! You know that this diary doesn't belong to you. Shut up! Marcela, stop. Marcela, just give me the letter and keep the diary. This letter is from my love! This is all I have! Marcela, I'm sorry, Marcela! The night before, when I invited you to my house. You took the diary. I'm sorry. I... I love you. I didn't know... In that diary, there was the letter. I was so angry. I didn't know what was going to happen. I was going to give it back to you the next day, I swear. Your selfishness has caused so much harm. But if you give me the letter, you will find your way. A new home. Forgive me. I love you so much. I forgive you, Marcela. Nikolaj. Will you help me? Of course, Poncho. We'll take care of it. Emil, Niko, what happened? Mom! Dad! What happened? Are you OK? Dad, I think we should leave. Sure, let's go. - Let's go - Come on, come on, come on. Come. Hello, kids. Hi. I hope this is not a bad joke. It's not a joke. It's something very serious. - OK. - Yes, well... Poncho wanted you to read this letter. But destiny wouldn't allow it until today. Poncho? It's been a while. Some things last forever, Mrs. Claudia. I don't know if I want to read it. For us, making sure that you have it, completes our task. Thank you. Sure. Let's go. Have a good day. Likewise. How do you know it's her? Well, let's say I can feel it. Are you mocking me? No, not at all. OK... Let's go. The city is beautiful, isn't it? Yes, very. When... ...are you going to Querétaro? One of these days. I see. But I don't want to talk about the next days. Look! I want to show you a video I made for you and... ...also to remember this moment and... ...what I feel about you. For me? Let's say it's like my audiovisual letter. Yeah, something like that. Thanks, Niko. But let's remember that I did this. Ready? Wait. Ready. Can you help me, please?
