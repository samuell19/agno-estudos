Sometimes women might be right. So I said: "I think I'm going to be famous." "I want to be famous!" I took some drastic measures. I went to find the great master Jessé Gomes. Who is Jessé Gomes? He's commonly known as Zeca Pagodinho. What's up, Zeca!

[PAULINO] And it was then that my friend, Chico Groin, saved me! He's with me, I know him. [PAULINO] He had never seen me. And he kindly helped me. Hey, bro! This one... is a close friend. - What the hell, man?! - I'm helping you, dumbass. It's true! We're very intimate friends. There's not that much intimacy, no! So, are you friends or are you not? It's true! We've been friends since the time we used... to swim naked at the Cunha canal, do you remember that? No, that's a lie. It's not true! Hey! What's wrong, buddy? Stop that, man! I can't! Yeah, he keeps his hand on that place all the time. There, between his legs, if you know what I mean. So, that's where the fame of the famous Chico Groin comes from. - Famous? - Yep! I've never heard about him! Yes, he is famous, yes. It was him who invented... the "stutter" of the samba school's drum section. Didn't you know it? ♪ Drums ♪ [DRUMS STOP] ♪ Drums ♪ [PAULINO] Chico Groin saved me that day. But he couldn't do much else for me. I've helped you out once. Now, to play together with Zeca... you're asking too much. Forget it! Because being honestly honest, I'm just... doing that for Nena Juju, y'know? Great Juju! Do you know Nena Juju? I mean, I know her, like, by name, right? - Aaah... - But go figure. There are so many Jujus in the world, aren't there?! Many! Many! Hey, there's Juju... for Jussara, for Jurema, for... Jurassiara... for Júlia, right? Jupira... Wait a minute, my Juju is for Jupira. Well... an easy name like that, right?! Common name! [LAUGHS] Yeah... common name. Hey, I won't be able to help you with Zeca. Now, don't worry, be cool, there's barbecue... there are chicken thighs, there's... caviar. Look! Caviar?! Do you know what caviar is? No!

I started looking for a job, Because I was totally broke! I didn't have a penny to my name. It was then that I stumbled upon a great surprise! Well, I found out that Nena Juju had opened a beauty salon. I decided, then and there, to work with her. It wasn't ideal, but I could make some money and also be close to her!

That's a shitty thought, isn't it? Come on, Juju?! Like, speaking like that, you hurt my... my profound sentiment I have for you. Because I think, with all honesty, that a couple who works together, a couple that rub crotches together... this couple remains together! First of all, I don't rub crotches with anyone! Second, we're not a couple! Third, since when do you cut hair? Where have you learned it? In the army! The military life prepares a man for any sort of difficulties. Did you learn to cut hair in the army?! Yeah! And I'm an expert! [NEIGH] This here... is my final touch! You're getting handsome to go to Little Trotting Mare's funk party! Hahahaha! Stay quiet! Work with me, buddy! When you're done, clean his dung! [NEIGH] Yes, sir, Sergeant! Alright! But everybody here wears white. And that's how I became an excellent hairdresser! Nobody had any complaints about me. Hey buddy, would you get a mirror, so I can see what it looks like at the back? As if the front were any better. - What's that, bro? - No, man! Trust me! I'm known in the neighbourhood as Gogo Scissorhands! It's all beautiful! My friend, I demand to see the back of my head, please! Alright! Alright! Since you insist, right? Here, take a look! Look, look how beautiful it is! I have style, brother! I was born to do this! Gee, bro! An accident! It happens all the time. The mirror's broken! I was doing fine, actually!

By the way, it was the last time Brazil won the World Cup. Well, that is true. That is true. Only after that, I had nothing but the clothes on my back.. But I enjoyed it! And luckily, I had many friends. Celso Anvil got me a job as a painter! [CELSO'S VOICE] "Hey Paulino, would you paint with my brush? "If so, come to my house tomorrow".

It stops at the other side of the park. Holy father! What a terrible blunder you've made, Miss nun! Why didn't you warn me before?! Excuse me!!! ♪ Cheerful background music ♪ ♪ Nena Juju!!! Out of my way birds! ♪ Nena, don't go! She's gone! ♪ Sad background music ♪ ♪ ♪ Smooth background music ♪ Juju? They told me you were here. No one told you anything. I slipped the note under your door. - So, have you forgiven me? - Not yet! I mean... Anger fades away slowly. Damn, even after three years?! If you keep grumbling about it, I'll go away for three more years! - Is that what you want? - No, for the love of God! Here! Nena, look... I've brought something for you! With love and tenderness, a box of chocolate. I know you like it. Now, let me ask you something, Nena. Why did you look for me? [BIRDS SINGING IN THE DISTANCE] Because of him. [PAULINO] Wow, what a handsome boy! Are you working as a sitter? Of course not! You're still the same donkey as ever... You can't notice anything around you. I'm not working as a sitter. That boy over there... is our son. Our son?! Are you kidding me? I'm serious! That is Paulino Thumpthump. Paulino! Come here with mom! Come, kiddo! Come here! Come here with mommy, come! Come, my son. Give your daddy a hug. A very nice hug! Do you want to see me play?! Of course I do, son! Does he know how to play it? Sort of. Play for him, c'mon! ♪ "Little Brazil" ♪ That kid is my son! He has a knack for it. His face, his gaze! See how he looks at things! His little mouth... this kid is my son for real. I won't even need to have a DNA test. Are you saying he might not be your son? No, I didn't say that. Just the opposite, right? He looks just like me! Nena, let me tell you something. I want... to say to you, Nena, that I... am really glad that you came back. Nena, look... you can count on me for whatever comes. ♪ Smooth background music ♪ And then the Sergeant came up to me and said: "Private Gogo! I didn't see you today at the camouflage class." [LAUGHING] Then I said: "Thank you, Sergeant!" If he didn't see me, it's because I was well camouflaged, right? Yes! You're very good at storytelling. Ahh, I really am. - Haven't I told you a story? - Never! Not a single story. And one thing I love is listening to a good story. But... why didn't you say so before? Hum... why didn't you ask me?! If you had told me a story before, you would've won my heart a long time ago! You wouldn't have to pretend to be that person you're not. ♪ Cootie?! This time it wasn't Cootie. This time it was Real romance! It was... It was love! It was passion! It was heart... it was pure emotion. It was the peace dove... that flew to find our eternal happiness! ♪ [PAULINO] And after that day, I learned that, in order to keep my Nena Juju happy, I just had to tell her a story everyday. About me, about her. There are so many stories, that I'm thinking about making money with them! That's what I always say, eh? I keep telling my stories... because the thing is that... "he who has no money tells stories." That's very important! Do you agree, mister? Are you speaking to me? - Nice to meet you, Paulino Gogo. - Nice to meet you! What is your label? - Sorry? I don't understand. - Your brand. - Ah! You mean, my name! - Yeah! Yeah... - It's Carlos Alberto de Nobrega. - Carlos Alberto de Nobrega... Carlos Alber... I'm gonna call you Cazalbeh! - Not Cazalbeh! - Too intimate, right? - My sidekick! - Sidekick? - My sidekick! - I don't know what it means, but whatever! Hey, sidekick, tell me something... do you think it's possible to keep a family... just by telling stories? Of course it is! Because stories... are tools of life. Some person's life story, sometimes it becomes an example for your own life. - Yep... - And there's another thing too. - Err... Sidekick, is it? - Yep! Yes! To tell a story... you need so little! So little! A small park... a bench, a friend... and there comes a story. Ahhh! That's nice, huh! Nice! I'm gonna memorize that! Yes, memorize it! Done, memorized. So... I'm looking at you here. Hmm... Your caricature kinda looks familiar. What caricature, young man? I've seen that mug somewhere. I've seen it, I've seen it! [LAUGHING] My caricature... Right! I just can't remember from where! Err... Now, since you're here, Huh? Don't you wanna listen to a story of mine? Listen, do I look like someone... who sits on a park bench... listening to stories? Ah, I have more important things to do, sidekick! - 'Till later! - Cazalbeh! - Let me read my newspaper! - Sidekick! It's because... [CARLOS ALBERTO] I was chilling out, then you came... - Nena Juju... - I was polite with you. ♪ It's Paulino Gogo! ♪ ♪ I'm telling a story ♪ ♪ And I don't miss a trick ♪ ♪ Who makes our people happy? ♪ ♪ It's Paulino Gogo! ♪ Nena did some sh... [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [CARLOS ALBERTO LAUGHING] No!!! [FAST FORWARDING] [AUDIENCE STILL LAUGHING] [CARLOS ALBERTO LAUGHING] [CARLOS ALBERTO COUGHING] [PAULINO] Do you want some water? Do you want some water? [LAUGHS] Cazalbeh, I liked her. I liked Sue Ellen... [CARLOS ALBERTO] You know she's a man, don't you? - Of course I know! - Ah, good! Ahh, good! - Of course I know! - What he has, you also have. - It's easier. Do you know why? - Huh? Over there, what I want is already guaranteed. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [CARLOS ALBERTO LAUGHING] [LAUGHTER CONTINUES] - Tell me, do you want me to stop? - No... [LAUGHS] [LAUGHING] So... ow, my Lord! Hey, I'll tell you something. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I'll tell you something... Then, a lady came by... an ugly lady, with two children, Cazalbeh. Then I looked, I looked at her, and said: "Ma'am, are they twins?" Then she got all rude and said: "You animal... can't you see that one is younger than the other? One is 9 years old and the other is 3 years old. How can you say... how the hell can you say... how do you have the courage to ask if they are twins?" Then I said: "It's just really hard to believe that someone fucked you twice." [LAUGHTER] [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] Hey Marcelo... [LAUGHTER CONTINUES] [LAUGHTER] Can I, can I? Hey, Cazalbeh... Let me speak... Let me speak, let's change the subject. Thing were a bit weird... Everything disorganized. The lion, king of the animals... the lion said: "Guys, attention, we're going to organize things here. I can't control your feelings. But since you want to do what you're doing, at least do it with the same species! Or else you're gonna mess everything up! Alright? Look, male giraffes with female giraffes... Male hippos with their females and so on. Or, at least, do as the elephant's doing, look over there, he's wearing a condom! Right? Look... The condom seems a bit tight but at least he's protecting himself!" Then, Cazalbeh, the elephant said: "Hey, mister lion. Please, I don't want to interrupt you or anything... but it's not a condom, it's just the rattlesnake playing my flute."
