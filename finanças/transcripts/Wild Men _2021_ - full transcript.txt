[Martin clears throat] Do you understand me? - Er, yes. - Yes. I'm afraid I forgot my wallet. So, we need to figure something out. Are... Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - [Øyvind] Do you need to call someone? No, I just need my groceries. And a pack of cigarettes. Eh... Well, then you sort of need money. I have money. We just need to make a deal. When I find my wallet, I'll be back. - We don't make deals. - Let's find a solution. No, and we don't sell beer after 8pm either. No... Okay. And you need ID to buy cigarettes. What's the age requirement? 18. Do I look like a 17-year-old? - No. - Do I look like an adult? - Yes. - Do I look like I had a normal day? - [Øyvind sighs] - No. I crawled down a damn mountain to get here! So, can we make a deal? Well, we still need payment. Of course. That's why I'm suggesting a trade. I get my groceries and three packs of cigarettes, you get an axe. Or better yet, I get my groceries, cigarettes and a bottle of booze, and you get a deerskin and an axe. [Øyvind] I don't know... We don't even sell liquor here. - [Manager] He needs to pay! - What? You can pay or leave! That's what I'm saying! I have a wallet, but I can't find it. [Manager] We accept Visa, MasterCard - and Norwegian cash. - [Martin] I know how shopping works! I'll be back with a credit card. Put down the axe. Just calm down! - What the hell are you doing? - We don't accept furs. - [Music grows louder] - ♪ We've been alone for a while ♪ Me and my heart retired ♪ Now I can only say... ♪ [Manager grunts, music quietens] [Martin grunts, Manager groans] [Axe clatters] [Manager groans faintly] [He grunts] [Martin grunts] Take care.

He's afraid of sailing. - [Bashir] I'm not afraid. - [Musa] Then what's your problem? I just...find it strange. What?

Just... - [Martin chuckles] - Are you Danish? - [Musa] Yes. - Okay. - [Musa] You are, too? - Yeah, yeah. [Musa] Your dialect did sound weird. Martin. [Groans] Musa. I have a cell phone back at my place. Maybe we should call a doctor? No, I'll be all right. - Are you sure? - Yeah... Should I stitch you up? - You can do that? - I have a first aid kit at my camp. I could take a look at it. Is that bag all you got? - Should I carry it? - No, no. I got it. [Musa grunts] - [Martin] You all right? - [Musa] Yes. [Martin] Loose the pants. - Let's get it over with. - [Musa groans, winces] [Musa grunts, winces] - [Musa] Can you fix it? - [He grunts] Sure, I can. But you must lie perfectly still. - [Musa groans] - Okay? [Musa] Yeah, yeah...

Look at me! - [Groaning continues] Lie perfectly still, or you'll get a nasty scar. - Okay? - [Musa] Mm-hm. - Good. - [Musa groans] [Musa yells] Wait, wait! That was the first one. Lie still. Then do it properly. Okay. We'll do the Band-Aid trick. What's that? [Martin] Remember when you were a kid and had a Band-Aid on? Did you take it off quickly or slowly? - Quickly. - [Martin] Exactly. - I'm gonna stitch you super-fast. - [Musa groans softly] - I'll be done in no time. - It looks disgusting. - Look at the sky instead. - [Musa groans] - Yeah. - [Musa winces] You're doing very well. Try to focus on something else. [Musa groans] - What did you have for breakfast? - Nothing. What breakfast do you like? Ful and tameya. [Musa yells in pain] [Musa] Ful and tameya. It's beans. I never heard of that. Do you boil or fry them? [Musa winces, yells] [Musa] You boil them with cumin and olive oil. [Martin] Oh, okay. - How about falafel, you like that? - Tameya is falafel. - [Martin] Okay. What about tzatziki? - [Musa groans] Or aubergine mash? - Baba ganoush? - Yes, baba ganoush. [Musa grunts] And lots of chilli? - Yeah, yeah, yeah... - Yeah. Do you like chilli? - This is a tough one. - [Musa yells in pain] [Martin] I need you to think of chilli! - Focus on that chilli! - [Musa winces] - [Martin] Yeah... - [Musa groans] - [Musa exhales] - Okay.

What do you mean? [Martin] Is this your first big hike? Sure... It's my first one. I like walking, too. It's good for thinking. Have you lived here a long time? I've lived here for... I can't recall. A year? No, more like... ten days. - [Musa] I see. - Yeah. But why? [Martin] I'd just... grown tired of everything. Then I thought... "I need an adventure." So, I came up here. Away from it all. What's up with the clothes? It's part of the adventure. Actually, I don't think it's all that different from when you go hiking. It's all about emptying your head, and calming your mind. "Who am I? Where do I come from? Where does the forest end? "Why is the world such a terrible and crazy place?" Right? I've tried road cycling, running clubs, half-marathons, even half an Ironman, but I didn't feel anything. Out here, I can feel it. I've been so sad. But I'm doing something about it. I came out here. Right? [Gentle, contemplative music; Birds chirp] [Music continues] [He grunts] [He groans] [Music subsides] [Engine shuts off, vehicle revs nearby] - [Soul music on PA] - Øyvind. [Petter] Petter. I'd like a French hot dog. - We have two for the price of one. - [Øyvind] Great. Then I'll have two. Right. Tell me your story. You were attacked by a Viking? He was Danish. Dressed in fur. About my height. - What kind of sausage do you want? - What kind do you have? [Petter] Grilled and chilli cheese sausage. Chili cheese sausages? It's just a sausage stuffed with cheese and chilli. They can do that? I'll have two. - Continue. - Well, he was Danish. Um... Brown hair, beard... He looked like a... What's the word? A wildman. - A wildman? - [Manager] A homeless wildman. 40 to 45 years old. - Hard to tell. He was so dirty. - Do you want dressing? No, thanks. - Danish? - [Manager] Yeah. What business does a Danish Viking have here? Look at these photos. Do you recognize any of those guys as your Viking? No. None of them is a Viking. Well, you're not wrong on that one. - Thank you. - [Petter] There you are. Hm! It's filled with cheese. [Petter] Yes. It's like an explosion in my mouth. Brilliant. [Player clicks] [Harmonica-led folk music on stereo] [Music continues] [Music continues faintly] - [Music stops] - Holy crap. [River burbles nearby] We should call for one of those sniffer dogs. - A search dog? - [Øyvind] Yeah. I don't know if it's working today. What else would it be doing? No idea. It is a dog... Dog stuff, I guess. Move. Christ. Look at this. You see that? It's blood. [Øyvind] Yes, I can see that, too. You are going on a picnic. I can't. - What do you mean? - [Eigil] I can't. I have to pick up the kids, and my wife is making a roast. [He inhales] - Can't it wait till tomorrow? - No, you must do it now. All right, Eigil? Put on your rubber boots... and find them. What about guns? Of course! Get your guns. - Right now. - [Tore] Yes. - Now. - [Tore] Yes. - Now, Eigil. - Yes. [Deep, ruminative music] [Øyvind sighs] [Car door rattles] [Music continues] - [Music subsides] - [Musa] How long will you stay out here? [Martin] I'm not going home again. - Never? - [Martin] Why should I? There must be someone you miss. Out here, I feel better every day. What about when it gets cold? I'm just happy that... I don't need to work for some ungrateful idiot any more. I never need to open a mailbox or a PC. What's wrong with mailboxes? - [Martin] What? - What's wrong with mailboxes? The mailbox is not the problem. I don't mind mailboxes. It's more what they represent - that there's a mail man who knows where you live. No-one should know that. Especially not a mail man. Try this. - Looks good. - Yes. I chose the right type of wood. [He groans, winces] I considered birch, but that has a tendency to bend. Elm is a lot better. - [Musa winces] - I'm pretty sure it's elm. [Musa exhales] Actually, a lot of people have started doing this. What? [Musa] Living without electricity, toilet, mailbox and so on. I'm headed for a place where everyone does it. - [Martin] Where? - Guddalen. You know it? Guddalen? No. [Musa] It's a village for people like you. They wear fur, and live off the land with bows and arrows and stuff. You know, that authentic lifestyle. I'm serious. It's an entire village living like that. [He exhales] [He clears throat] [Martin mutters] [He sniffs, exhales] [Phone rings, vibrates] [Ringing stops] - Hello? - [Indistinct talking on phone] Hi, honey. I'm in a meeting right now. - [Anne, on phone] We have to talk. - Yes. One moment. [Bird hoots] [Flames crackle gently] Well, I don't know, honey. The reception must be lousy up here. - Didn't you get my texts? - [Anne speaks indistinctly] I don't understand. I wrote a lot of them. - [Anne] I haven't received anything. - I can't control that. It's the reception that's lousy. Anne... - What? - [Anne] Are you sure? Yes, of course. [Anne] Are you all right? - [Martin groans softly] - [Anne] Tell me if something's wrong. When are you coming home? I don't know. I don't decide this stuff, all right? - That's how things are. - [Anne speaks indistinctly] - No, I'm not mad. - [Yelling in distance] - No. Yes. - [Anne speaks indistinctly] [Rumbling percussion] But you know what? I need to run now. Bye! [Tense, suspenseful music] [Rustling] - [Tore] Take it easy. - [Musa] My leg. Get off my leg! - [Tore] Easy! - [Musa] My leg! Let go. If you lie still, you'll be fine. Get off my leg. [Martin] Let go of him! [Officers stammer] Let go of him. Let go of him. - Lower your bow. - Shut up. Get off him! - Lower your bow. - He's got nothing to do with this. He's completely innocent. Get up, Musa. Cuff them. - [Musa] Please don't say my name. - Sure. [Music continues] - [Cuffs click] - You got them? All right, listen to me. I can explain this. I was hungry as hell. And then I was assaulted. He attacked me. He hit me. [Martin pants softly] Musa, I'm going with you, to the town you talked about. Okay. [Martin] I want to see it! I'll protect you. [He pants] Okay, let's hit the road. - Eh? - Yeah, yeah, yeah... We're out of here. Goodbye. [Musa] Stay down. You can stop pointing at them. Come. [Footsteps recede] [Phone rings] [Ringing stops] [Musa grunts] Martin, not so fast. It hurts like hell. [Martin] We should've given them water. I'm sorry that you got mixed up in this. [Musa] What did you do? - Don't get mad, all right? - [Musa winces] I...robbed a gas station. - What are you talking about? - I had no choice but to do it. - [Martin clears throat] - It's all right. No. I'll go back to the cops and give them an apology. Then we can forget this whole thing. - [Musa] Take a deep breath. - [He inhales] - Inhale through your nose... - [He exhales] Exhale through your mouth. Okay? - Can you feel it? - [Martin] Feel what? How did it feel when you held that bow? It felt... It felt all right. It was almost an out-of-body experience. I felt like puking. Violently. That's because you're alive. Because you act. You're a man! You aren't passive. - You're taking charge. - I don't just sit still. I'm doing something. That's what I felt. [Musa] It was obvious. It looked awesome. "This is my life, and I'm taking charge of it." - That thing... - [Martin] Yes. Yes! [Both grunt, yell] That's not road cycling. Or a running club. - Are we going to Guddalen? - Yes. [Woman] Why do you have to do that right up in my face? Was it a demonstration... because we haven't had sex for three months? No, but there aren't many other places I can do it. [Woman] What? You can do it at work. You have eight hours to jack off, but you chose to do it just when I have to brush my teeth. It's not always easy to control when the...urge arises. [Woman] Not easy to control? Can't we just forget it? [Woman] You don't even understand what I'm saying! I need you to tell me that you don't find me disgusting. - But I don't find you disgusting. - [Woman] Then why don't we have sex? I'm wondering about that as well. [Woman] You're wondering about that as well? Why don't we have sex? You'd rather jack off in the bathroom than sleep with me! That's not easy to know. When I've tried approaching you, there's always something. And you are... I do get it. [Woman] I never said that I didn't want to. It's you who aren't trying. [Man] Can't you relax, then? You only think about yourself... and your own needs. Never me or anyone else. Bloody egotist. - I think about other people. - Yes, when you jack off. When's the last time you did something nice for me? I've done many things... What? You can't even remember. I'm pregnant. [Man] Yes, I do know that. You know what you lack? Altruism. What are you talking about? Yes, you never went to the university and don't know that word. Altruism is the opposite of egotism. I thought that was common knowledge. [Faint ticking] - What are you doing? - [Man] What am I doing? Altruism. [He sniffs] - That's not what I meant. - Then what did you mean? - They are not coming with us. - They need help. Oh, God, one of them is an immigrant. - What did you say? - One of them is an immigrant. Did you really say that? He looks dangerous. Are you a racist? Can you be altruistic and a racist at the same time? Don't call me a racist. - Oh, shit. We have to go now! - [Engine sputters, shuts off] - [Woman] I'm not a racist at all! - Let go of my hand! [Soft, uneasy music] [Music subsides] - Hi. - Hi. - We're lost. - [Man] Shit. Where are you headed? Have you seen a dude with short hair and a sports bag? - [Bashir sniffs] - Uh, no. No, we haven't seen him. - [Simon mumbles indistinctly] - What? [Soft, uneasy music] Can we make a call? Oh, the phone. I don't think so. The reception is bad out here. [Simon] Can I look at it? I'm sorry. We're in a hurry... [Simon] Is it working? No. There is no signal out here. We're going to a dinner, so we are in a bit of a hurry. [Bashir] Yeah. Is the town far away? [Man] Where? Gudendalen, I mean. Guddalen? It's not that far. About 20 km. Perhaps 10... Hey... - The signal is fine. - [Man] Can I have my phone back? - Can we get a lift to town? - We have no room. - What are you doing? - What a nice car. All-new. There's lots of room! [Bashir exhales] Are you pregnant? When are you due? Leave the car, please. Please, leave now. Are you having a boy or a girl? - [Tense music] - [Woman] Will you leave the car, please? What are you doing? - No, no, no! - [Man grunts] [Man exclaims] - Leave the car, please. - [Engine revs] - [Man] Hey! - [Woman squeals] [Woman wails] Let her out, man. - Let her out. - [Music subsides] [Woman sobs] [Car door opens] [Woman sobs] [Engine revs] [Car recedes] [Portentous music] [Music continues] [Brakes creak] [Keys turn] - [Music stops] - Do you have a key? Come here. What the hell happened? We met the Viking. At his camp. The one from the gas station? We followed the blood trail to a guy who's collaborating with the Viking. We found the Viking's phone. His wife is on her way from Denmark now. He cuffed you? - He threatened us with bow and arrow! - Bow and arrow! Take me to his camp immediately! No, Øyvind. "No, Øyvind"? I have kids. I can't run around in the woods like that. I'm always half-something. I'm half police officer, I'm half a dad. There are other things in life... than work! Oh, really? You can go home. I'll go with Øyvind. Huh? Right? [Garage door clangs, engine idles] [Faint electrical hum] [He exhales; Soft rattling] [Rattling stops, he smacks lips] [Tap runs] [He chuckles, wheezes] [Tap shuts off] I'm sorry I got held up. A lot of weird stuff happened at work. It seems we have a Viking running around... ..in the woods. [He sighs] You should've seen it. [Soft rattling] I wish you could've seen it.

And honestly, I think that us men... we aren't suited for living with other people. - No? - [Martin] No. I think that... If you look at people who lived in 7000 BC, at that time, the woman kept people together. She guarded the family while the men hunted.

We won't. We are two strong men. Okay? But our stuff will get wet. [Martin] It's an old Viking trick. We have a tarp. They didn't back then. Then we put all of our stuff in it. Like that. Then we lace it up. Now, it's completely waterproof. Check this out. [Martin grunts] [He clears throat] What are you thinking? What? I told you I was hungry, and then you threw our food in the water.

POLICE [Engine rattles, shuts off] [Birds chirp softly] Hi. [Øyvind] Why are you out here? The Viking's wife is inside. [Øyvind] So, why are you out here? She talked about some seminar. I don't know how to talk to her. She doesn't understand me. - Hi. - Hi. [Øyvind] Let me hang up my jacket. I'll be right there. Welcome. - I hope you had a nice trip. - Anne. - Øyvind. - Hi, Øyvind. Have you found him? Er... No, not yet. Hi. So, these are your daughters? Yes. Sally and Luna. So, have you heard from him? What do you have on the floor? [Sally] Eh... - Is it an animal? - [Anne] He asks what animal it is. - It's a rabbit. - A rabbit. What's it called? Er... - What's it called? - [Sally] Er... Rose. - It's called Rose? Rose the rabbit. - [Anne] Have you heard from him? No, but we know he's in the forest. - In the forest? - Yes. But...it's a rather big forest. Yes. Not just big. It's gigantic. And we have very limited manpower. Is it just the two of you? No, we're three, actually. Then call somebody and get help. - Anne. - [Anne] Yeah? - Can we talk in private? - Of course. Eigil? Show the girls around, so they can see how we operate up here. There's not much more to see. Improvise. You can play cards with them. Show them the dog. I think the dog has a day off. Then call it. - Should we go to my office? - Yes, I'd like that. A rabbit? [Anne] He packed his bag. We had breakfast. He said goodbye to the girls and me, and then left. There's nothing... Okay. And that was two weeks ago? Yes. He was going to a team-building seminar. [Pen thuds softly] Do you have marital difficulties? - No. - [She scoffs] - [He mumbles] - Is he dangerous? - What do you mean? - Is he violent? No... he's not. - He never got in trouble with the law? - [Anne] No! - [She chuckles incredulously] - Martin is not a criminal. There's nothing mysterious about him. What's this? It's... What's he doing? - [He inhales] - Good question. What are those clothes? [Øyvind] He also threatened two colleagues, cuffed them and stole their guns. But he... I don't know. I thought about it this morning. Either he's gone insane. That is, lost his marbles. Or he's in a gang of international drug runners. - [Tense music] - It's one or the other. [Music continues, wind rushes] Martin? Martin! - We're lost. We've been here before. - [Martin] No. Yes. I recognize that rock, Martin. Hey! My leg's killing me. I'm hungry. We have no map. - We don't need one. We're going east. - [Musa] Where's east? - [Martin] Look at the moss. - What? [Martin] Look at the moss. Your ferry's on the other side of the mountain. Moss grows only on the north side of stones. It's nature's compass. [Musa] Is that an old Viking trick? - No, it's common knowledge. - [He sniffs] [Musa] That one has moss on the right side. It's on the left on that one! That stone has moss all around! Is that a good compass? It's a lousy compass. But you knew the way to Guddalen. Yes, before you threw our fucking map in the water! You know what? I don't think this is easy either. I'm hungry, too. It's tough as hell! But that's what it's all about... [Gunshots reverberate] [Reverberation subsides] Look at the goat! Do you think we can eat it? Absolutely. Eh? [Car doors lock] [Engine revs nearby] [Luna] Mum? - Mum? - Yes, honey? Where's Dad? We are just trying to figure that out, okay? Sally... - They'll find him, all right? - [Engine revs nearby] - [Luna] Mum? - [Anne] Yeah? We need to get food for Rose. Yes, of course. Food for Rose. I'll go inside... I want to go with you. Okay. Come on, then. [She exhales] [Keys rustle] [Gulls squawk in distance] Right. Come. - No, put the rabbit in the car. - She needs food. No, not into the store. [Carrier clatters, Sally screams] - [Anne] No! - [Sally] Rose!? [Anne] It's under the car. Can you reach it? Rose! No, Sally! You'll get hit by a car. I'll get her. [Sally] Mum! Mum, that way! [Anne pants softly] [Panting continues] [Panting stops] [Sniffing] [Sally sobs] Honey... - [Sobbing continues] - You know what I think? I think she thought, "I don't want to sit in this cage, "with all that lovely nature just out there!" Right? I think she'll get eaten. [Sobs] No! No, she won't. She's probably dead already. [Sally] She needs to be with us - so we can take care of her. - [She sniffs] You're right. But she doesn't know that. She's just a... [Pensive music] ..stupid little bunny! [Luna] Mum? Are you crying? Yes. I think it's fucking unfortunate. [Anne sniffs, sobs] [Music continues] [Music continues, wind howls] [He exhales] Didn't you sleep? - It's my son's birthday today. - [Martin] That's right. Congratulations. - And you're going to Guddalen. - [Musa] Yes, I am. - Are you ready? - [Martin] Yes. [Martin grunts] [Music continues] [Martin] You should consider opening a restaurant. - That goat tasted amazing! - [Musa chuckles] Imagine that. Musa's Goat Restaurant! [Musa chuckles] [Martin] You could make goat burgers, goat lasagne... Goat pizza! - [Both chuckle] - [Martin] Right? Oh, my... Wow. [Music swells] - [Martin] What a beautiful sight. - [Bird calls overhead] Really beautiful. Look! - [Martin] What? - [Musa] Do you see the little dots? - [Martin] Are you sure? - [Musa] Yeah, I recognize it. [Martin] Good. Let's go. [Adventurous, purposeful music] - What did I tell you? - Awesome. [Music continues; Indistinct chatter] [Viking Leader] Hey! Stop. - [Music concludes] - You snuck in the backdoor. [Martin mutters] We don't like people creeping up on us. It was the only... We couldn't find the front door. And you didn't break anything open or wreck anything? - No. - [Viking Leader] Are you sure? Yes. [He chuckles] I'll let this one slip, because your outfit is just awesome. - Thanks. - [Viking Leader] It's very impressive. Welcome to our camp. Martin. Wow! Would you look at that. I have the same one. See? Yes. That's impressive. Like I said, welcome. Everything you see is authentic. If people are cooking, it's because they're hungry. If they're working with wood, they're simply building something... they need. - Yes. - We actually...live here. This is our home, so it's important that you show us respect. It's the same word in Danish? Respect? Yes. I have the utmost respect for your way of life. - Everything you've done. What I see... - Ah, ah, ah... You have a powerful gaze. That look in your eyes... It's quite unique. Welcome to our camp. [Lively, indistinct chatter] He seemed fantastic, eh? Sure. He was very intense. [Martin] Did you see the stare he gave me? Extremely charismatic. But he doesn't greet people wearing normal clothes? [Chatter continues; Sprightly woodwind music nearby] - Hi. - [Man, in English] Good afternoon, sir! Good afternoon. - Welcome. - Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. - Welcome to our humble home. - Yeah, it's very nice... [Chatter continues, pan sizzles] - [Goat bleats] - [Martin, in Danish] It looks delicious. And it smells good. Thank you, thank you. I could eat a piece of meat like that, no problem! [He chuckles] Three or four pieces? - Four. - [He chuckles] [Kristin] You're hungry. - I'm a big boy. - [Both chuckle] My name's Martin. Kristin. Kristin. What a pretty name. Nice fur. [Martin] Yeah. You, too. [Both chuckle] [Kristin] There you go. - [Card machine beeps] - That'll be 120 kroner. [Soft, uneasy music] 120 kroner? You know what? I can trade you this fur. [Kristin] I'm sorry, we don't accept furs. We accept cash or cards. MasterCard, Visa, Visa Debit, American Express. Basically everything. - Just not furs. - [She chuckles] [Music continues] [Boisterous laughter nearby] - Hi. - They accept... credit cards. [Musa] Should I pay? I have cash. I don't want anything. Why, Martin? - I don't want anything, Musa. - Get something. No. Not like this. Martin, let's... Martin. Martin, my treat! Can I have one more? [Music, chatter continue] [Traditional music with thumping electronic beat on PA] [Music grows gradually louder] [Viking Leader] Hey. Stop! [Music shuts off] [Viking Leader] What the hell are you doing? This is no take-away here. What did I tell you about respect? The people here... It's their home. And you steal from them? You said they cooked food because they were hungry. That's right. You didn't mention white bread with ham and cheese. You call that authentic? Don't lecture me on authenticity. I sleep under a reindeer skin... ..six months a year. Impressive. But you wouldn't last five minutes outside that gate. We are men. We don't steal. [Martin] You never read a history book. The most Viking-esque thing here is me nicking these bread rolls. Put it down, or we'll call the police. With your authentic Viking phone. Or maybe you'd prefer... ..a citizen's arrest? [Viking Leader] I'll give you five seconds... to put down what you have...stolen. If not, we'll show you just how authentic we are. - One... - Two! - Three... - [Martin shouts] Call the police! [He yells] - [Dramatic music] - Come on! [Clamouring] [Man] Come on. [Martin] You're really tough in numbers, eh? [Viking Leader shushes] Hey... Hey! [Man] Relax! [Musa grunts] [Musa] Hey! - Hey! - [Gunshot reverberates] - [Music softens] - What the hell are you doing? What are you doing? - Sorry, he... - No, what are you doing? - Yes, what are you doing? - You, too, Martin. - Yeah? - [Musa] You, too. - Yeah. - You're cooking food over a fire. - It's a fireplace. - [Musa] Fireplace? Have you heard of the oven? - [Viking Leader speaks Danish] - Why make it so difficult? Huh? You might as well live in a refugee camp! Adults in carnival costumes. Do you want real trouble? - [Gunshot reverberates] - [Martin] Musa! Musa, Musa! Let's go. Why do you keep saying my name? Martin, Martin, Martin... Untie him! Whose car is that? [Music continues] [Musa] Is it yours? Martin, take the key. [Gunshot reverberates] [Music builds] Come on. [Music continues] [Musa groans] [Martin] I'll take you to the ferry, and then I'll return to my camp. In a car that's stolen, with blood everywhere. Brilliant idea! Yeah... [Bus recedes, music subsides] [Wind howls] [Lounge jazz music on speaker] - And it was just for one night? - Mm-hm, yes. Just one moment... Can I have a lollipop? Hm? - [Bashir] Can I have a lollipop? - Yeah. - Sure. - Thank you. - [Simon mumbles indistinctly] - Hm? [Mumbling continues] Uh... [In English] Can we do this in English maybe? [In Danish] Have you seen a brown-skinned dude with a sports bag who might've been here? [Receptionist] Oh, uh, no. - But if he comes, would you tell us? - [Tense music] [Receptionist speaks Danish] You see, it's his birthday, so we want to surprise him. [Receptionist speaks Danish] - [Bashir] Thank you. - You're welcome. [Music continues, chicken squawks] Did you see the chicken? We're working, Eigil. [Music subsides] Are you putting this down? EV... 53... 489. - [Tore] "..489." - A grey BMW i3. New front grille. Electric car. There's also an iPhone 6 in the car. You just gave him the key? He had a gun. Oh... Was that before or after they raided the kitchen? After, of course. What is this place? Is there something sexual going on here? Absolutely not. Nothing sexual at all. [Øyvind] Then what is it? It's a place where you can get an authentic Viking experience. [Eigil] My wife and I have been here. They didn't have chickens then. [Tore] Okay. But you're quite sure that one of them was in Viking attire? The other one had civilian clothes? That's right. This is madness. Like my brother-in-law. He loved nature, so my wife and I gave him outdoor gifts every year. Hiking boots, mosquito repellent, etc. But... ..we found out... that he hadn't been in the woods or the mountains. He was just humping a buddy of his in a little wooden cabin. They'd done it for years. When my sister confronted him, he had a breakdown and hung himself. Isn't it horrible? What a waste of life. All those birthdays, he didn't get what he wanted. He had no use for that mosquito repellent. - That's peculiar. - It's a damn waste of life. Let's go, Tore. Are we done here? - You said the phone was in the car? - [Viking Leader] iPhone 6. We'll find them in no time. - [Portentous music] - Take care. [Music continues] [Music subsides] [Glass shatters] - [Door creaks open] - [Martin] Hello? [Musa shushes] - [Martin] Hello! - [Musa] We'll go in there. Hello? [Door creaks] [He groans in pain] [Musa winces] [Martin clears throat] [Musa winces] [Musa yells in pain] [Yelling continues] - [Musa groans] - We must get you on the ferry, and I'll return to the mountain. [Martin clears throat] [Musa winces, exhales] [He groans] I haven't... I haven't been... - I haven't been honest with you. - No, you haven't. I'm not talking about the Viking camp. I'm talking about... I smuggle hash. [Musa groans] I smuggle hash from Denmark to Norway. I was... ..on my way to the ferry, and then I got in an car accident. I was with two other guys. Then I ran into the forest. Then I met you. [Martin] What happened to the others? They died. - [Martin clears throat] - [Musa] I'm sorry. What was I supposed to say? "I'm smuggling hash. Can you help me out of the forest?" [Martin chuckles softly] Then you would've left me, right? That might've been for the best. Yeah... [Martin Now I get why you can't see your son. [Soft, stirring music] [He exhales] [Musa] I want to go home. - Let's go home. - I'm not going home. You have to. [Martin] Who are you to tell me what to do? Do you have any right telling me what I should do? What is your plan with all this? I have a sweet wife at home. She'd do anything for me. We have a nice home just like everyone else. But the good life is suffocating me! I can't talk to my wife about it! You understand? I don't want to talk to anyone. That's why I'm here! Get it? [Music continues] [Martin sighs] [Martin] I can't do it any more. [Music stops, wind rushes softly] [Birds chirp] [Siren beeps] [Portentous music] - [Øyvind] Martin? - [Car door slams] - Tore? - [Tore] Stop! [Martin exclaims] Martin, stop! Stop! I'm...a police officer. This is the police! [Music subsides] [He breathes shakily] [River burbles nearby] [Tore sniffs] We lost him. He's gone. There's a great fly-fishing spot a few kilometres down the valley. Fly-fishing? A river. Stretching all the way around. He can't get away. We got him now. [Portentous music] [Øyvind] Oh, my... [Music continues] [Sensor beeps, gate rattles] [Music continues] [Music softens] [He grunts] [Phone vibrates] [Vibrating continues] [Vibrating stops] [Mechanical rattling nearby] [Music builds gradually] [Music continues] [Scraping] [Music softens] - [Musa] Hi. - Hi. - [Musa] Hey. - Welcome. Do you know when I can get a ferry out of here? I'm sorry, - they won't sail until tomorrow noon. - [Music subsides] Okay. Then, I'd like a room. - Okay. Just for you? - Yes. Sign there. Do you have anything to eat? Sandwiches? - I only have potetgull. - What? [In English] Chips. [Birds squawk] [Soft, uneasy music] [Lock rattles] [Door creaks] [He sighs] [Music continues] [Music continues] [Simon grunts, music heightens] [He groans] [Music heightens further] [He yells] [Music softens] [Thud; Musa exclaims, groans] [Groaning continues] [Musa shudders, winces] Are you done? What? [Simon] Where's the bag? I thought you were dead. [Simon] I thought we were friends. Where's the bag? I don't have it. - I don't have... - Where's the bag!? - [Musa yells] - Where's the bag!? - Huh? Where is it? - [Musa groans in pain] I'll tell you, I'll tell you! Fuck, man... [He exclaims] A man in Viking clothes that I met - threw it in a river. - [Simon laughs] It's true. He took all our stuff and threw it in a river. It's true. Where's the bag? [He breathes shakily] I don't have it. - Of course you do. - I swear I don't have it. [Simon laughs] [Music continues] [Musa] I'm telling you I don't have it... - Where's the bag!? Where!? - [Musa yells] [Yelling continues] [Simon] Where's the bag!? [Yelling continues] [Portentous music; Dog barks in distance] - [Man] Martin! - [Man 2] Martin! - [Woman] Martin! - [Woman 2] Martin! [Man 3] Martin! [Music continues] - [Man] Martin, where are you? - [Woman 2] Martin! [Man 2] Martin! This is the Norwegian police. [Dogs bark, sniff] Martin! [Dog barks] [Man 2] Martin! [Woman 2] Martin! [Man 4] Martin! [Woman 2] Martin! [Dog barks] [Man 4] Martin! [Rustling] - [Music continues] - [Woman 3] Martin! Martin? - [Anne gasps softly] - [Man 5] Martin! Martin... Honey. [Martin shushes] Oh, my... Look at you! - Don't. Stop it. - [Music subsides] - Are you hurt? - [Martin] No, I'm fine. I'm fine, I'm fine! - You're cold. Are you freezing? - No, I'm perfectly fine. [She exhales, river burbles nearby] What the hell are you doing? Why do you always touch my neck!? Martin, 25 police officers are looking for you. They say you've beaten two policemen! - [Man] Martin! - [Dog barks] [He clears throat] [He exhales] I think you should go and talk to them. I can't. I won't. [Anne] On your feet! Don't touch my neck. Stop it. Then explain to me what's going on! Okay. [He exhales] What would a person born 3,000 years ago make of a modern supermarket? I don't know. Martin, you don't know what you're saying. You've hurt your head. [Martin] You don't understand. No, you're talking nonsense. I had to remove something to find out what I really need. That's why I'm here. I must get away from you to see if I miss you. And I don't think I do. - Of course you do. - [Martin speaks Danish] I stand on my own out here. I built a camp. I hunt my own food. I've shot a deer. I ate a bird! If you don't understand that, I don't think we should be together. Martin, I love you. [She exhales softly] I want a divorce. What the hell are you saying? [She breathes shakily] - That's it. - I drove all the way to Norway... - to hear you say that bullshit! - [Dog barks] The girls are waiting in the car. Did you think about them? No! - You only think about yourself! - I think about you! - That's why I'm here! - This is ridiculous! - You look like a Christmas decoration! - Stop. - What is this? - It's branches! - It's branches! - You look idiotic! Let go of me. Let go, dammit. - Stop it! - [Tense music] [Music continues] [Music deepens] Do you have anything I can cut myself on? My knife, perhaps. [Øyvind ]Take off his fur. I don't want to stink up the car. Put it in the back. And that one. [Car door shuts] [Music continues; Faint, indistinct conversation] [Music concludes, resonates] [Pen clicks, papers shuffle] [Øyvind exhales] Am I going to jail? You're charged for armed robbery, car theft and hunting without a license. So, that'll be my recommendation. - [Martin exhales] - Can I use your phone? Who do you want to call? My wife. I sort of told her that I want a divorce. - What? - [Martin] I told her I want a divorce. [In English] I told her that I wanted a divorce. [In Danish] I understand, but why the hell do you want that? - She's a wonderful woman. - [Martin] I know. Both her and my girls are great, but they're ashamed of me. They don't say that, but I can feel it. - [Øyvind] I see. - [Martin exhales] So, you dressed up as a Viking to feel like a man again? My god... You're so unbelievably simple. It's marvellous. [Phone rings faintly] [Øyvind] I'm an old fly-fisherman. You know, fishing with flies. Always loved it. In the woods, you feel this peace, tranquillity and quiet. We all need that. My wife always asked if she could join me in the woods. I said no. - I needed that time by myself, all alone. - [Soft, stirring music] A time without all her questions. So, I lied to her. Told her I was going to work, which was just dumb. You don't come home from work with a huge load of fish, do you? Then one day, she was gone. - Did she leave you? - [Øyvind] No. She had a stroke. It's difficult to understand how little time we have. [He inhales] If I tell you where Musa is, can I borrow the phone? Certainly. [Martin] Guddalen. - [Øyvind] Guddalen? - But I don't know where. It's a small town. There's only one place he can be. Can I use the phone? - No, you're going with me. - [Music subsides] - We agreed that if... - [Øyvind] We're going to Guddalen. [Engine hums, rattles] [Foreboding music] [Sensor beeps] [Gate rattles] [Music continues] [Brakes creak] [Engine shuts off] [Music softens] [Øyvind exclaims softly] It looks like Musa has found his old pals. [Martin] What do you mean? That car was stolen. Okay. [Tense music; Tap runs] [Tap shuts off] [Music continues] [Birds squawk in distance] [He exhales slowly, softly] [Music continues] [Music subsides] [Knock at door] - [Knock at door] - [Øyvind] Hello? Open the door. It's the police. [Knock at door] [Øyvind] Hello? Open the door. It's the police. [Genteel voice] Just a minute! [He exhales] - [Simon] Where is it? - [Musa scoffs] Are you going to kill me with a cop standing out there? [Musa chuckles, wheezes] [Knock at door] - Hello? - [Birds squawk in distance] Can you open the door? It's the police. [Bashir chuckles] [Øyvind speaks indistinctly] Get a hold of yourself, Simon. - Get a hold of yourself. - Where is it? [Music continues] [Musa] Are you fucking crazy? Don't do it. Put away that gun. [Music continues] I'll tell you. Put away that gun. Simon, I stashed it outside. [Music continues] [Lock clicks] Where are you going? [Music continues] [Suspenseful music] [He grunts softly] [Music continues] [Faint ringing tone] [Music subsides] [Anne, on answerphone] This is Anne. I can't pick up the phone now, but leave a message, and I'll call you right back. Bye! [Martin] Hi, Anne. It's me. I'm so sorry about what I said to you earlier. There's something wrong with me. - I don't know what the hell it is. - [Soft, stirring music] But I'll do everything I can to get back home to you. We really...need to talk... about you and me. I know that you hate me. But please tell the girls... Tell them... ..that I love them... I love them. [He sniffs, sobs] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [He breathes sharply] [Disconnected tone] [Laboured breathing] [He gasps softly] [He exhales] [Music continues] [Musa grunts] [Soft, uneasy music] [Car door opens nearby] [He exhales softly] [Øyvind grunts] Get out of the car. Come. Come. Turn around. I need your handcuffs. [Martin yelps in pain, grunts] [Martin breathes shakily] [Music continues] [Music deepens, builds gradually] [Music heightens] - [Rifle cocks] - Stop! [Gunshots reverberate] [Music softens] [He grunts] [Bashir slurps] [Music continues] [Soft footsteps in snow] [Pistol clicks] [Sharp thwack; Bashir yells in pain] - Fuck! - [Booming percussive stab] [Stab reverberates] [Gunshot reverberates, birds flutter] [Reverberation subsides] [Dark, suspenseful music] [Door creaks] [Music continues] [Music softens] Stop! [Gunshots reverberate, Øyvind grunts] [Reverberation subsides] [Øyvind grunts] [Pistol cocks] [Gunshots reverberate, music subsides] [Reverberation subsides] [He pants softly] [Soft, uneasy music] [Music continues] [Martin] Where is he? He went up there. [Soft, stirring music] Just let me be. What should I do? Go home. We're all just playing dress up. You're bleeding. [Øyvind grunts] I'll be kissing my wife soon. If you believe in that stuff. I mean... That wouldn't be too bad. Go home, you idiot. The ferry's about to leave. [Music continues] Should I carry the bag? Sure. [Music continues] [Music continues] [Martin] I'd like those sandwiches... and two sodas. And I'll have one of these. [Clerk] Sure. 480 kroner. Keep the change. [Music continues] [Martin grunts softly] [Music subsides] [Indistinct conversation nearby] [Musa laughs] [He exclaims] It's really dry. [He coughs, splutters] [Musa gags, wheezes] [He groans] Thanks.
