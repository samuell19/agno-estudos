Were you the one who found the body? "Found the body"? As in, I was looking for it? Rubbish. Did you know him? The bartender says he is an illegal immigrant. Is that true? Sir, do I look like I work in the immigration department? Dear... I've seen him around. He used to come here with his friends. But he was different. He liked to collect old things, antiques. Last night, he gave me this. Hey! It's exactly the same. It's just like that kid we brought in that day. Five months ago? The victim's identity? Or the killer's? There's no trace of it at all. We're checking his DNA now. Man. Anything else? That can't be all. His blood seems like it was sucked out completely. A vampire? Man. It's not possible for a person to do this. Where's Adam? He never answers his phone. That kid? He has a good head on his shoulders. But it's just not screwed on properly. Police. Don't move. Return my keys, Man. When someone calls you, pick up your phone. Seriously, is this what you've been doing? Taking photos of your neighbors? You're strange. At least, these people are still alive. Nice. No wonder you don't come to work anymore. But it doesn't seem real. So, what is real? Adam. There was another murder last night. There are murders every night. I used to photograph them, don't you remember? What about this one? Is this real enough? The kid we found five months ago. I don't want to see photos of that kid anymore. The killer is causing trouble again. This was from last night. We also found these at the crime scene last night. What's this? Not again. Is it like a photograph? It's not a photograph. Old cameras used glass negatives. All I can remember is... You went into a state of shock and then passed out. So, there's another one like this? Looks like you have to help me. You know you can help me. Don't pretend that you can't. Damn it. I've given you what you wanted. I'll have to charge you after this. Did you forget that the university still pays you because of me? How about this? You only have two options. One. You help me. Two. Don't help me. How about that? You've gone pale. Is it because of me or something else? I'm fine, Man. You know where to process this, right? Didn't you promise me? What is this now? Don't you think you should just deal with it? Who knows if that studio is still open or not? Don't complicate things. Can you help me? I need to get back to the station. Damn it. I can count on you, right? Yes. After this, I'll get a witch doctor to fix the problem in your head. Then, you can come back to work. Sweet thing, are you lost? My compass is upstairs. It only needs a needle. Hey, dear. Give me some money. It counts as a good deed. You're so sweet. If possible, I would like to take you out as well. But we all have our own paths. You know this is not what I came for. You have to be ready. The money. Soon, our work will be done. And you're still counting? Who knows? Many things have happened. Many things can still happen. Are you all right? You dropped this. It's your lucky day today, isn't it? Wait for a while. What's wrong with you? Heng. Can you print or scan this? Are you a photographer? I take photos of corpses. Who were you running from? Do you need my help? A top dog in the antique world. My scanner is broken. Forensics, right? Heng. Wait for a while. Hey! Inspector Raj. But you can help me trace them, right? He was hanged. Adam. Sorry, I don't have time to roll out the red carpet for you. I can't see anything. Such a buzzkill. Somebody, cut off the steam. Go home. Take your selfies. Adam. What's wrong? Aren't you worried that he'll cause trouble again? He wants to help. Let him be. Didn't his doctor extend his leave? I'm his doctor now. Here's what he has. Where's the other one? It's urgent. If you can't have it done now, return the negative. And you will look better in prison. Don't mess around. How did you find this place? My mom. She used to bring me here. Why couldn't she just take you to the zoo? Jason. Follow me with the car. Belian, have you found that negative? You do your work and I'll do mine. I know what I'm doing. This work has become my life. This is not living, Sani. You know that. Don't force me. Through the years, I've seen all your games. You know it's pointless. You can try to fool yourself. But you can't fool me. It wasn't me who tricked you. We were all cheated. It's not my fault we haven't found that negative yet. Hey. This is your fate. You must accept that. Everything in this world has its order. It's so lively here like there's a feast. Adam's mom can't make it. How can I be of assistance? Are all of you looking for antiques? This man gave you a glass negative, right? You came here all dressed up and you're only looking for negatives? Wouldn't you prefer this? Palang from Borneo. Ms. Sani. It is Sani, right? Can we look around? You may have a look out here. But to look inside, you need a warrant. Where is Adam? Adam. I want to know everything about them. I have a feeling about this. Did you find anything? Man, can you smell that? Yes, I can. Iva. Adam. Is that you? No. It's my great-grandma. And this is the story of our tribe. Is your great-grandma still around? Longevity runs in our blood. It can be a curse. It's nothing. It can only be found in Southeast Asia. Including Borneo. Isn't this bird extinct? The problem is all the feathers we found are fresh. As in, it's still alive. This one. It's from the beak of the bird. Birds again. Aren't there any other animals? Outstanding record. In 2007, she was imprisoned in Surabaya. Like a ghost. Before making accusations, we need to establish a motive, isn't that so? It's easier said than done. Look at this. Where did you get this? They can't be the same people. Are you crazy? You're calling me crazy? Bodies with no blood, veins hanging out. Who did that? Humans? Or birds? They must want something from the victims. Maybe it's the antiques? Well, that's my theory. You're being rude, don't you think? Hey. This is crazy. It makes sense, right? Let's go to the market. Hey, dude. Do you want to have one? No. This is new. What do you want again? What bird is this? It's 235 dollars. That's expensive. Is it a Tinggang piece? If you like it, buy it. If you don't, keep moving. What about these? Do you sell these? Hey! This is not your story. What were you doing there? Are you following me? Weren't you the one following me? I saw what you saw, Adam. Iva. Who was that guy? Do you know him? Maybe he is like you or them. They have been trapped here for a long time. Maybe they have forgotten where they came from. If the birds were set free, would they know where to go? They will find a way back. Are you a witch? In my tribe, I'm called Dayong. I release trapped spirits. Man. I think we can trace the next victim. How do you know this woman? Don't talk nonsense, Adam. This was taken in 1915. A hundred years ago? Look. Our priority right now is Sani and her guy. -Do you know what you saw? -I know what happened. Man, there are too many weird things in this case. Things that don't make sense. But we know who will be the next one. We have to protect her, Man. If she really exists, bring her to me. They're so slow. This is beyond slow. This is unacceptable. How are they sending it? By texting? Man. Is she the next one? Sani. The big boss of the antique shop. Do you know her? Do you kill people? Who wants this photo? Who do you owe money to? Do you want the truth? You will never believe it. All of us are a hundred years old. All of the people of my ethnicity are in that book. We are all trapped. Enough. You are not sick, Adam. The Tinggang tribe has been extinct. So, all the victims are not from the Tinggang tribe. They were probably tricked. They thought they were from the Tinggang tribe. So, using the negatives made it seem real. What do you think they are after? You have taken all my things. But you forgot one thing. Me. I've quit smoking. So, what else are you selling, Ms. Sani? Black magic. Black... My ancestors are known for longevity. So, they have been hunting my descendants down with the negatives that you found. They get more lives. Do you know who they are? How would I know? All I know is... Arrest me. I'm sure you can find a reason. As long as I'm not out there. I'll be safer in here. Do you think this is a hotel? To come and go as you please? You have to help me. That's difficult, Ms. Sani. Only if I believe what you said. Do you think I'm just fooling around? You've been fooling around for six months. Do you want to watch? Tickets for tonight. Please escort her out. What are you doing, Man? We'll follow her and we'll see. Let's see if she is the bait or the fish. Metropolis didn't believe your story? The brain rests when the stomach is full. Humans. That's normal. But our story is extraordinary and I am not full yet. All stories must come to an end. But we still don't know how this woman's story ends. It's as if she doesn't want her story to end. A woman who can live forever does not need a conclusion. Living through eternity is idle work. It's a waste of time. But this woman never wasted a single breath. She keeps counting every minute, every second, through the ages. Yes, Belian. I am still counting. No matter how many breaths you take, what matters is once you inhale, you must exhale. That is all. I need to take a leak. Hey. Where are you going? Jason, answer me. Adam has gone in. I don't know what the problem is. There's nowhere else for you to run. Let's go, Iva. This is your story now. -This is a penthouse, right? -Yes. Go to the lobby and block all exits. I'll check the rooftop. Hey! Sir, we found Jason. Where is he? Did he get lost? We thought he was with you, but he is here. Let me see. Please have a seat, sir. It looks like I was attacked by an animal. Just a little bit more. She is an animal indeed. Gosh, this needs stitches. A bandage will do. But I still need to clean it for you. She was with him. A girl did this to you? This girl is different. She is different indeed. Where's Adam? Hey, Man. Iva. Iva. Iva. We were cursed, Adam. Iva, don't. When the photographer came upriver, he took photos of my people. My tribe believed that the camera could steal our spirit. And that is exactly what happened. Enough. There were 38 of us in total. What do you need me to do? Just hold it there and don't let go. Don't let go. Your fish is dead and your bait is gone. What's this? What are you trying to say? He didn't even take one photo, Man. And the glass negative is missing. What should we do now, Man? Don't speculate. We're adrift, Man. Lost at sea. Detective Man. I'll give it to you later. Run, Iva. Run. Animal. Where is Adam? You can take anyone else, but not Adam. You do your work and I'll do mine. -Adam. -Run, Iva. Adam. What do you mean he got up? Track him until you get him. I'll deal with Adam and that damn witch. It's here. We don't have much time left. You better tell me where they are. Before I break your head... -Adam. -Let's go. Adam. Jason, answer me. I've left the Dream Studio. They're heading for the river. Hurry up. Run. Adam. Adam. Adam, don't do this. -Adam. -Man. -Adam. -That's enough. -Adam. -Oh, lord. Run, Iva. Run. Iva, hurry up. Adam. Ouch. A hundred years. Nothing is like how it was. But we remain the same. Adam. I want to go back. Forgive me. Forgive all of us. Because of us, you are trapped here in this world. When this is over, you can spread your wings once again. I can't. Finish all of this, Adam. I can't do it. Adam. You can. Adam. Stop it. Remember not to let go.
