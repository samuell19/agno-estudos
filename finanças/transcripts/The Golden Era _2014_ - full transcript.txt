I'm Xiao Hong My real name is Zhang Naiying I was born on June 1st, 1911 It was the day of the Dragon Boat Festival My family were land-owners in Hulan County, Manchuria At 11 am on January 22nd, 1942... ...I died I was in a makeshift hospital in Hong Kong I was thirty-one "Blossoms appeared in our back garden in May" "Then the fruits In June" "Cucumbers, eggplants, corns, kidney beans..." "...watermelons, tomatoes..." "...and pumpkins with creeping vines" "But the mood in our place was desolate" How old were you when your mother died? Eight I was only seven months when my mother died My father beat her So she took opium to die I heard that when she died, she was only 19 or 21 I don't know what she looked like There were no pictures "I'll probably never understand people like my father" "To servants, to his own children" "and to my grandfather. .. ” "...he was mean and aloof" "It was my grandfather who taught me that" "life includes love and warmth..." "...as well as coldness and hatred" Hurry and grow up! Things will be fine when you're grown up "I ran away from my father's house when I was 20" "Ever since then, my life has drifted" "I've grown up, but things are not fine" "ZHANG XIUKE Xiao Hong's brother" When my sister was about to finish high school... ...father arranged a marriage for her My sister resisted She was in love with our cousin, Lu Zheshun And he was already married When they ran away to Peking together... ...Lu Zheshun was pressured by his family and soon abandoned her My elopement made me notorious throughout the county Our family felt disgraced I got back from Peking in the middle of the night My father responded by ordering the whole household... ...to move to our place in the countryside Xiao Hong was locked up for ten months Then she fled to Harbin "SHU QUN Xiao Hong's friend, a writer" Later, Xiao Jun asked her many times how she escaped She didn't answer We know nothing at all... ...about what happened to her in Harbin But her later writings show that she was almost destitute Cut off from everyone she knew "In early winter..." "...while walking in the bracing cold..." "...I ran into my young brother" "The coffee-shop windows..." "...were frosted up" "I hung my coat with its worn-out collar on a hanger" You should come home It's so cold! You still play basketball at school? How's it going? You still like it? I'm better at it now I wish you still came to watch us Sister...come on home You look unhappy You'll get ill before long Why do you say I'm unhappy? Your hair's grown long You should get it cut Are you going to go on drifting? It's getting colder and colder "My young brother's eyes are pitch black" Since sister ran away, our family was ruined My father was fired by his Department ...on the grounds that he'd brought up his daughter badly I couldn't stand being mocked by my classmates So I changed school twice I ended up in Harbin Second High School That chance meeting with my sister... ...became the subject of her essay "Early Winter" She never saw our father again before she died Not long after our meeting... ...she rejoined the man she was supposed to marry His name was Wang Enjia, a primary school teacher Brother... Where's your dignity? You may not care, but your family does Why have you taken her back? This bitch all but ruined us! And you sit here, eating and drinking with her! Aren't you ashamed? Show some backbone! Come back, don't run! Welcome! You from one of the brothels? - Are you? - Come on in! What is it? I'm coming That summer evening, Wang Enjia walked out of her life He was never heard of again "BAI LANG literary editor" They had moved into... ...a swanky hotel in November 1931 "LUO FENG writer" They stayed there for seven months, until they were broke They owed the hotel more than $400 It was $600 A huge sum at that time Later, the hotel locked Xiao Hong... ...in a storeroom She hoped that Wang would reappear She wrote... "In May last year I tasted green apricot" "In May this year, the misery of my life..." "...tastes like that green apricot" But Wang Enjia never did come back Stranger yet, the whole Wang family disappeared too Yet another unsolved mystery in the life of Xiao Hong Excuse me, are you Zhang Naiying? I'm the editor of International Gazette, Lao Fei He writes for us We received your letter In her letter, she said if she couldn't pay the bill... ...the hotel owner was going to sell her to a brothel... ...in lieu of payment It turned out to be true The woman has guts It was smart of her to write to us We must help her! Really help Damn it! I'm a woman too And the money? Where do we find that much cash? If we pooled all we have... ...it wouldn't come to $600 We could publish her letter Appeal for assistance You think anyone would donate a cent? San Lang hasn't said a word all evening I have nothing... Except the hair I can't afford to cut these past few months If I could turn my hair into cash... ...I would go bald San Lang is drunk Write something and sell it! The only ones who'd buy my stuff are ghosts! I can't write stuff that sells The evening of July 13th, 1932... Xiao Jun and Xiao Hong were destined to meet. Xiao Jun mentioned that first meeting twice in his writings "Her pale, round face was framed" "by long, straggly hair" "She seemed nervous" "and her voice sounded frightened" A letter for you So you're Mr San Lang (better known as "Xiao Jun") I'm reading one of your articles Haven't finished it yet This one... The Orphaned Child I like it Here are the books you wanted Lao Fei asked me to bring them I'll be going Can we talk? All right? Let's talk Who drew this? I did it in an idle moment And the calligraphy? Yes You copied a master? We did it in class And the poem? I wrote it "At that moment, I felt the world was changing” "The season was changing" "People were changing" "My thoughts and feelings were changing too" "Right in front of me" "was the most beautiful woman I'd ever known" What's your philosophy of love? What philosophy? Either you love... ...or you ditch the whole business What if you can't do that? Then you're stuck with it I've grown quite fond of a girl who lives downstairs When she gives me a smile... ...I feel I'm the happiest guy in the world What do people live for? Why do you live? You have plenty of reasons to kill yourself now Me? Because there's something in this world... Some mystery that I cling to... That's why I go on living Me too "We had too much to say" "I was ready to go several times..." "But I stayed" Buy something to eat That money was his bus fare! That night, Xiao Jun had to walk ten miles to get home And next day, he went to the hotel again Why? Why do I have no strength I can hardly open my eyes Why is that? Love does that to you The power of love may be great... But not greater than $600 Xiao Jun and the rest of us were useless We couldn't raise the money to save Xiao Hong Xiao Jun tried everything We were at a complete loss... ...when Harbin was suddenly flooded Uncle! Uncle! Uncle boatman! Here! I'm here! Uncle, I'm pregnant I'll give birth soon! Help me! Turn the boat around The baby for Bed 2 It's a boy Your family will be happy! The baby for you No! Xiao Hong had the baby adopted Nobody knew the details A year later she wrote The Foundling, which told us how she felt Your belly still hurts? Come along! Come on! Watch your step! Over here, you two I'm coming Sign here? Sit down All right? Yes Take it slowly It's slippery I'm all right Nothing to drink from... You want the bedding? Yes Fifty cents per day Then never mind Stingy bastards! Hungry? No Your belly still hurts? No It's freezing outside? Cold and hard Eat You're back What's that? I redeemed the clothes we pawned Put this on I'll wear the sweater Where did you get the money? Stole it! I got a job as a tutor Really? It's a good place The rickshaw pullers all eat here Excuse me... Come... Taste good? I haven't started - You want meat? - Yes Boss... Five cents-worth of pork OK - Which part do you want? - This And this - Thank you - Here you are Pig's head meat! Look! Try it? Nothing special Look! We have plenty already We don't need meatballs It's meatballs in soup We'll have one bowl Okay It's hot! It's very good! We should have a drink with this I'll keep you company My shoelace broke! "Electric lights ablaze in the packed city" "With cash in our pockets," "the two of us stride boldly down the street" Madam Xu! I'm reading Xiao Hong's Market Street She writes so well about cold and hunger We all know about poverty these days... But no-one writes about it better than she does Keep your arm and leg straight Straight! You're too padded! Point! Use your wrist Good And back And back Thrust! Swing! Roasting your legs? Let's eat! This is Lao Huang Zhang Naiying Come on in San Lang's here Zhang Naiying This is my wife San Lang Sit down Saline betrays Our Lord... ...by following the Communist path! I will reclaim her for Our Lord Lord, please grant me the strength... Amen Saline Saline you are so kind... Saline... Saline... Auntie... In our family, the second miss and the eldest son are both kind But the elder sister's children are annoying Auntie... Bai Lang! I warn you, if you keep on giggling, I'll punish you! You too, Jin I won't laugh I won't look You shouldn't be laughing either! Try it again No more laughter! Auntie... Your fever is raging... Listen, stop laughing! Be serious! Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Later, our life improved a great deal We even hired a Russian tutor Xiao Jun started learning how to drive One day he came back and said he'd made a new friend A high school student from Shanghai Her name was Cheng Miss Cheng came by very often Xiao Jun borrowed skates so that we could go skating together New friends...well, we got closer day by day But she got closer to Xiao Jun She began to write to him They met often, but still needed to write to each other San Lang... San Lang... Was it true, what you said? That day at the hotel That if you hadn't seen my writing and drawings, we wouldn't be together now? What do you mean? Was it true? As I said... I love you for your talents And if I had no talents, what then? "The Orphan" After a While, though, Miss Cheng stopped coming Maybe she was afraid of me The final time she came... Xiao Jun is out I've come to say goodbye I'm going back to the south This is my boyfriend Hello I'll tell San Lang when he gets back He will see you off Good I'll be off, then That spring, Shu Qun lost contact with the Communist Party He was in danger He left Harbin in a hurry, for Qingdao And once he'd gone, there were consequences Are you Miss Bai Lang? Yes, and you are...? You are Luo Feng? Please come with us to the Bureau Bread, please We can go 3.5 cents for the bread and sausages Sausages? I didn't ask for sausages! Don't blame me I didn't ask you to buy anything Hey, kid The Bureau isn't stupid They see that Luo Feng is mocking the "Manchukuo Day" celebrations They're sure to hold Bai Lang responsible too You need to take care, Jin Oh yes... San Lang is at risk too For non-Party members, he and Xiao Hong are too conspicuous They don't even know that we're Party activists I've asked permission for them to be evacuated right away Let's go We saw the couple off They left Harbin for Qingdao A week after they left, Luo Feng was arrested again Two years later, Jin was killed by the Japanese Lao Huang disappeared We never saw him again I ran around trying to save Luo Feng "In the village..." "...men and beasts were occupied in the business of living...and dying” "The cycle of life and death there went on..." "...exactly as it had ten years earlier" "The same number of sparrows congregated on rooftops" "The sun was just as warm" "Nothing had changed in ten years" "Ping and Lnock-Knee were adults!" "Aunt Wang stood, with flying hair" "Outside her plot listening to songs from the mountain" "Flags which the villagers never saw in cold weather” "Flew up, fluttering skywards" Xiao Jun, I have received your letter I shall answer your two questions First, don't ask what we writers want now Ask instead what you can do We never expected Lu Xun to answer our letter Nor that he'd answer so quickly When I finished The Field of Life and Death, I was at a loss I had no idea how to get it published I hadn't moved in literary circles After Lu Xun's reply arrived... ...Shu Qun and his new bride were arrested by the Kuomintang Then the wife's whole family was arrested too We made a hasty escape from Qingdao The political situation in Shanghai is grim The Kuomintang is in charge everywhere except the foreign concessions In tandem with the suppression of the Communists... ...the government targets cultural activities Lu Xun has been in hiding for four years He lives a semi-clandestine life There are literary groups, with different political orientations The debates between them are bitter As the most prominent writer in China, Lu Xun stands... ...attacked... ...from all sides "NIE GANNU poet & essayist" In his seventh letter... ...to Xiao Hong and Xiao Jun... ...Lu Xun invited them to a meeting You are Mr Xiao Jun? Yes Then let's move, shall we? This café is mainly patronized by clients from the ballroom nearby It's quiet in the daytimes Very few Chinese So I tend to meet friends here How are you doing these days? Thank you, Mr Lu Xun Thanks Thanks Help yourselves Is Madam Xu coming? They're on their way Daddy! Daddy! Let me introduce you Mr Xiao Jun Miss Xiao Hong This is Madam Xu Hello Do sit down You look pretty! What did he say? He says you're pretty Thank you! What's your name? He's called Haiying But he thinks the "ying" is too feminine, so he doesn't like it He'll change it when he grows up It's sometimes interesting to observe a child But to raise one entails giving up all your own time It's troublesome Hey... You should answer the question Xiao Hong posed in her letter Do I look like a loose woman? I told you it was just a rumor! I'm always surprised by the kind of rumors they spread about me Most are made up by so-called writers Do they hate me so much? Most just differ on approaches to writing I don't socialize with them They're basically just amusing themselves I can see that we've overrated the writers in Shanghai We've come from the far north We've been longing to come to this cultural center We thought leftist writers were exemplary fighters I think writers tend to have a character flaw Their lines of thought are not too steady Sometimes they bend to the east, sometimes to the west Few of them have firm convictions When the left prospered... ...they rushed to join what seemed a fashionable cause Then, when the persecutions began, they changed direction Some even betrayed their friends, handing them over to the other side It happens in other countries too But I think it's endemic in China It's really a bad thing How is Ding Ling doing since they seized her? She's still under house arrest in Nanking We are not sure about the rest Here you are... Small change for the tram Give me the manuscript Haiying! Xiao Hong! Xiao Hong! Madam Xu! It's terribly cold today It's all right Lu Xun is waiting for you Welcome, please come in Let me introduce you You can talk freely in front of these people This gentleman is our "boss" Good to meet you Mr Nie... His wife Miss Zhou... And this couple are Mr Xiao Jun and Miss Xiao Hong They've recently arrived from Manchuria We're supposed to be celebrating the birth of Mr Hu's son, but he's absent. Maybe the invitation didn't reach them Shanghai has its deficiencies Move round a little Make yourselves comfortable "HU FENG literary critic" Mr Lu Xun's invitation was delivered the day after the party "MEI ZHI writer" That's... ...why we weren't there I'm sorry they waited Lu Xun later gave me Xiao Jun's address, and asked me to contact them directly After that dinner, Lu Xun wrote to the Xiaos, saying... "The enemy is nothing" ”Much more terrible are the pests in our own camp” "They're the ones who cause disasters" "Sometimes I feel lonely, even distraught" "Still, I just do what I can" "Even if I'm on the verge of despair" Coming! Please come in Madam Xu... "The first time we visited Lu Xun's home" "was in winter, towards dusk" ”It was a little dark in the downstairs room" "Mr Lu Xun had two kinds of cigarettes," "one expensive and one cheap" "The cheap ones came in a green canister," "and Lu Xun smoked those himself" "The others were in a white canister,” "served to guests" Help yourself! I have enough You drink Enough for me Help yourself Enough Both of us raise a glass to you on our first visit Thank you Thanks for your dinner He's very happy that you came - You drink for me - I'll drink for him You're always welcome Bottoms up "In Mr Lu Xun's parlor, there's a pot-plant" "When I first saw it, I asked..." What is this? It's an evergreen An evergreen? Yes It will always look like that "That evening, we chatted from 9pm to 10pm..." "...and then until 11pm" "We wanted to go, so that Mr Lu Xun could rest" "We could see that he was not in the best of health" "Madam Xu fold us he'd had a cold for more than a month" "He'd only just got over it" "But Mr Lu Xun didn't seem tired" "After 11 o'clock, it began to rain" "The rain pattered on the windowpanes" "It was late, it was raining..." "We felt uneasy and kept getting up to leave” "But Mr Lu Xun and Madam Xu insisted that We stay longer" "The trams run until midnight" "And so it was nearly 12" "before we went outside" Mr Xiao Jun... Sir Next time you come...remember this plate My house is on the lane with this plate No. 9 Remember it I will Goodbye Go back indoors! Goodbye - See you again! - Take care on the road! ”Mr Lu Xun insisted on seeing us off on the alley" "I was thinking..." "Why did he insist on seeing off his two young guests?" "The rain would wet his hair" "He could catch a chill and be ill again" Xiao Hong is a better writer than you are Xiao Hong's characters are so real... intensely alive We can feel their joys and sorrows It's as if we're living their lives And you... You're richer in insight But we can see... Thank you...I can't drink much That's enough But we can see... You're so painstaking - in achieving what you do - Absolutely Whereas Xiao Hong's genius is that she relies more on her feelings It's really something precious Precious I've always thought highly of her talents But she still needs my help Xiao Hong is there alone I told Haiying to play with her Go and keep her company Haiying... Go fetch your toy bricks Then you can play with me and Auntie Xiao Hong, all right? Can I finish this first? I have to fix my car Xiao Hong is in the front room again She spends half the day just sitting there I don't have time to keep her company She's suffering, lonely... She has nowhere else to go So how can I turn her away? Miss Xiao Hong was a powerful writer But in dealing with her problems, she was far too emotional... ...as women always are I'll eat out During her lifetime, Xiao Hong never mentioned... ...her break-up with Xiao Jun So we'll never know exactly how it happened We are both prone to sickness It pains me... It seems I have spent my whole life... ...being ill and scolding others I lost all my teeth before the age of 30 So I have a mouthful of false teeth I gave up drinking... Took cod liver oil... ...to prolong my life Not only for my loved ones... ...but also for my enemies I know... I'm not a magnanimous man For me, to speak of happiness... ...means either looking back to the old days... ...or looking forward to my final resting place All warriors are like this We live in such a place... We live at such a time... Mr Lu Xun hosted a farewell dinner for Xiao Hong in his home Madam Xu prepared the food herself Xiao Hong left for Japan Lu Xun must have known about the crisis between Xiao Hong and Xiao Jun But he never said anything Maybe he felt he shouldn't interfere Lu Xun introduced his friend Huang Yuan He advised Xiao Hong to spend some time in Japan... ...to write and to rest Huang's wife Yuehua was studying in Japan... ...so she could take care of Xiao Hong Xiao Jun was moving to Qingdao "Jun..." "Today I went out for the first time" "I went into Jinbocho" "It's a district full of bookshops" "But I didn't much enjoy it, since I was alone" "I walked back the same way" "Everything was fresh to me" "The streets and sights are quite different" "But there's a black river..." "...just like the one in Shanghai" "Sorry-looking boats bobbed on it" "There were women with their children..." "...in ragged clothes" "And the dark water smelt just the same" Most of these letters were sent by Xiao Hong in 1936 and 1937 While she was in Tokyo I've been roaming around for more than forty years... So the fact that these letters have survived... ...and can be published today... ...is little short of miraculous If you get lost, ask a passer-by Travel safely, Yuehua! "Jun, Yuehua is taking me to a doctor for a check-up" "Very cheap, only two dollars!" "Without her help," "I wouldn't have been able to go" "You probably haven't heard..." "Her father-in-law is ill, and they have no money" "So Yuehua has to go back" "Once she's gone, damn it, I'll have no friend here" "Jun, " "I've had a fever for some days" "My lips are chapped" "Of course, everyone has to die" "But knowing the fact is one thing..." "Accepting it emotionally is another" "Now he's been gone for five days" "Where is he sleeping now?" "Mr. Lu Xun's tomb" "Jun, when moonlight whitens the window..." like to turn off the light and sit in silence" "Then suddenly the sound of a bell in my heart" "breaks the silence" "Isn't this my golden era? Right now?" "I touch the tablecloth, I turn around, I touch the chair...” "I raise my hands in front of me" "It's rather vague..." "But I'm sure these are my hands" "Yes..." "I'm in Japan... free and comfortable" "Calm and carefree" "No money worries" "It really is my golden era" "And I'm spending it in a cage" ”As for love, I was once unfaithful to her" "During our time together," "she was faithful to me" "It's a fact, I admit it” "But while she was in Japan..." had an affair with Yuehua" "It didn't last long" "Yuehua and I both knew that we couldn't stay together” "So, to end our fruitless affair," "we agreed..." "...to urge Xiao Hong to return from Japan" "So that's what we did, however much it pained us" I tried to lose myself in writing To forget my misery But it was too much to bear When I couldn't stand it any more... ...I crept outside to walk in the streets The desolate streets... I wandered about... ...like a ghost He ended his affair with Yuehua for moral reasons... But he'd got her pregnant She had an abortion I didn't hate her I didn't let it end our friendship I still respected her I was grateful she'd taken care of me in Japan Soseki's novels took issue with the Meiji period's view of the world... Let me introduce you This is the Japanese writer, Mr Uchida And his translator You must know Jin Yi already Xiao Jun - Xiao Hong - Nice to meet you Sit here, Xiao Jun What happened to your eye? What happened? You're lucky the eye itself wasn't hurt Does it hurt? Be more careful! It's nothing I bumped into something in the dark It's all right What would you like? Anything I go this way Be careful! Ok, no problem What are you hiding? I hit her Don't listen to him It wasn't deliberate He was drunk, I tried to stop him drinking He pushed me aside, and I hit something Don't defend me! Leave me alone! The "July 7th Incident" in 1937 launched the war with Japan Xiao Hong and Xiao Jun came to Wuhan "JIANG XIJIN poet, writer" I first met them one morning Back then, we were working for the magazine The Fight I lived across the river, and the ferry stopped running at midnight I never finished work until late, so I couldn't get home I had no money for a hotel, so I had to sleep in the quarantine boat The guy in charge, Yu Fei, was my friend That morning I went on board to do my job Sit down, everyone! When you've been checked, you can go! Xiao Jun! Yu Fei It's you! She's seasick... Xi Jin! Over here! Help them into our boat Thank you "ZHANG MEILIN Writer" When I saw Xiao Hong again in Wuhan... ...I felt she'd changed, but I couldn't work out how Lots of people visited their place, mostly writers and artists One day a pale-faced man turned up He was slightly hunched over and wore smart clothes Xiao Jun! Look who's here! - I can manage - Who is it? Xiao Jun! Hey! Duanmu! - You got my letter? - Of course! If I hadn't, I would be here! Sit down Have some tea I didn't think the letter would reach you so quickly I have to look up a friend to find me a place to live Why bother? You can stay here Right? It'll be no trouble Hu Feng and Nie come by every day Xi Jin has a room to himself, let's ask him Don't bother Xi Jin You can sleep in our room It's a big bed I'll sleep in the middle, Xiao Hong on the inside, you on the outside You won't fall off, I promise! You haven't had a cigarette all day Don't you want one? Actually, I don't smoke But when I read your novel... ...I had a cigarette We hadn't met back then Thank you Xiao Jun says your writing lacks power But I think The Field of Life and Death is bold and forceful It's better than his Village in August You get closer to the essence of literature You're the more talented They always said my novels were no good That was because I didn't write the way they expected I don't believe in rules There should be as many types of novel as there are writers I agree You like my gloves? You have such small hands! Fits me perfectly! You really are so bourgeois Let's go Nie! Duanmu! Xi Jin! - Good of you to come! - We are here to say good bye In January 1938, Li Gongpu, founder of the People's Revolutionary University... ...arrived in Wuhan from Shanxi He came to enlist intellectuals to teach at Linfen Six of us writing for our magazine July agreed to go Everyone except Hu Feng The other six, Xiao Hong, Xiao Jun, Duanmu, Nie, Ai Qing and Tian Jian... ...all volunteered to go to Linfen The University also recruited students from Wuhan The north is a sad country... Zhang Mutao, Trotskyite and spy for the Japanese... ...after the Xi'an Incident... ...stirred up militants in the Communist armies of the north He took advantage of their wish to rescue Zhang Xueliang And incited them to attack the Kuomintang army... ...to overthrow Chiang Kaishek When the anti-Japanese war began, Zhang Mutao returned to Taiyuan... ...and agitated against unified resistance to the Japanese He denounced the United Front of Communists and Nationalists... ...as "class capitulationism"! Down with Zhang Mutao! Ding Ling! - Xiao Jun! - It is you - I hardly recognized you! - Long time no see! Xiao Hong! Ding Ling is here! - Take a rest, - Wait a moment everyone, and wait for orders! Dismiss! Thank you You must be Xiao Hong! Hello Ding Ling Hello Let's go inside, come on Don't say that, don't say that... I'll stop here! Don't say that, don't say that... Are you hungry "It was early spring when I met Xiao Hong" "It was still cold in Shanxi at the time" "I'd been in the army for a long time..." "...so I was used to hardship" ”When I saw her pale face... ” "Her determined lips..." "Her agile manner, her nervous laughter..." felt she was special" I thought back to my own youth "But her talk was natural and direct" "I felt it strange that she, as a writer..." "...seemed so naive" "Maybe women are unashamed to appear ingenuous” "And that's why she seemed so naive and vulnerable" "But we got along very well" "She was forthright" "We sang together heartily..." "...and talked into the night" When I was in Yan'an... ...I helped collect material about the Red Army Now I'm editing a history of the Long March Based on accounts by the soldiers themselves It's called Our Story Every day I go through testimonies... ...written on all kinds of paper, in all colors They describe heart-warming actions, fired by a great spirit It's deeply moving I conclude that writing skills alone... ...aren't enough to achieve great work While I was writing my first novel... ...I felt two opposing forces at war inside me My blood was telling me I was a writer But my soul was filled with the passion of a warrior When I reached the Red Army base in Yan'an... ...I decided to give up writing I think my great work will be my actual life and my fighting! So the old Ding Ling died... ...and a new Ding Ling was born Is that it? I've written in my diary that... ...when a great mission confronts you... ...you must forget your own insignificance We stayed in the Revolutionary University for only 20 days The Japanese Army started shelling Linfen The university decided the writers should be evacuated Those willing to stay would retreat with the university staff The others would leave for Xi'an Xiao Hong and Xiao Jun disagreed about which group to follow I've thought it through... I'm going to stay and form a guerrilla unit What about me? You know that all I want is a peaceful situation to write in You know that this is what I've always longed for Even back in Harbin, I wanted to join a guerrilla war I'm not content to just be a writer It's not my goal in life! San Lang I know I won't live long I don't want to go on suffering all these hardships San Lang! Many of those who die in battle have talents! We're all fighting for liberation Why should some preserve their talent while others die? Each contributes what he is best able to You're forgetting your duty as a writer! You're being willfully blind! I haven't forgotten anything! Let's go our separate ways If I die... I don't think I'll die, Some day we'll see each other again And can be together But if we don't we can make it a permanent break All right You aren't sleeping? Soon Aren't you asleep yet? Haven't you two finished? I'm really tired of your arguments It's nothing to joke about These arguments make us so unhappy It's better that we go our separate ways Never mind I'll sleep outside You two make up - We're moving out tomorrow! - Ding Ling! Don't come out We're all men out here! What does it matter! Don't go out I won't go to Xi'an I'd rather stay with you We can live or die together! Or you could come with us I won't rest easy if you stay here alone I know your temper Don't be silly You all leave first If nothing changes here, you can come back It'll be the same as before Xiao Jun... Don't make Xiao Hong so anxious He's stronger than us He fights well He runs fast He should stay You're not weak yourself! Why don't you stay? How can we compare with Xiao Jun? It's his chance to serve the country What about you? Duanmu, why don't you stay too? Stay here and work with me Then I won't be lonely There are many students here to teach No, I'd better go to Xi'an I'd rather not die in battle Don't worry I've survived a lot already But that was then! Things are different now! You've never listened to me! Let him go He's a capable man He can look after himself You just love him too much You'll just make the man you love feel bad I've had enough! The wind and the dust! My nose and ears always filthy! You can always shut yourself away indoors to write... Are you serious? What exactly are you trying to tell me? Nothing It's still about Xiao Hong I know Take care of Xiao Hong! You've said it a hundred times Yes... Her health is fragile And she can't cope When you reach Xi'an, if she want try to send her to Yan'an Otherwise, keep her in your troupe Just don't leave her alone Anyway, she and I will meet again Right! So why were you so callous yesterday? Now you're all care and concern! Comrades, let's sing a song for Xiao Jun! Good! Have you eaten? Not yet, I was about to And you? I've eaten But I'll treat you No need for that I must treat you tonight I insist Can you do me a favor? What? Look... You like this? I've kept it for a couple of years Today, Duanmu asked me to give it to him I told him to wait I'm going to hide it... ...and tell him I gave it to you If he asks, will you tell him you have it? What does the stick symbolize? What are you thinking? I've told you I find Duanmu tiresome He's soft, cowardly... You've also said that you have a spirit of self-sacrifice That's only where Xiao Jun is concerned! Xiao Jun says you're easily fooled Not when it really matters Xiao Hong, let's go to Yan'an together I don't think so Why not? I might meet Xiao Jun there I doubt it His temperament won't take him there He must have joined the guerrillas by now I love Xiao Jun Even now He's an excellent writer We've battled many hardships together But... To be his wife would be to suffer too much Xiao Hong... You've written The Field of Life and Death and Market Street You have to consider your position in literature You must fly high... The higher, the better... The Tang Dynasty...Preface... This is the Preface to the Three Sacred Doctrines As written by the Buddhist monk Huairen He used characters copied from Wang Xizhi's writings It contains a preface to Xuanzang's translations of Buddhist sutras Also an essay by Prince Li and Xuanzang's note of gratitude The entire collection is known as the Preface to the Three Sacred Doctrines You've stored up a lot of learning I never knew that about you I used to study history It's nothing special It's a real shame that I know so little about history To show my appreciation... ...I'll treat you to cold noodles tonight Since you're so modest, I should treat you Look! The light from the torch... Isn't it like a jellyfish? Yes Ding Ling and I went to Yan'an for ten days We brought someone back with us We're there! We're back! Commander Ding is back! Hello, everyone! How's everything? All right? If anything happens, please help! Dust yourself down first! Then me second! Understand? Yes Sure? Then go! Xiao Hong and Xiao Jun broke up What exactly happened remains unknown to outsiders The three parties involved... ...give conflicting accounts In old age, Xiao Jun's version was like this... San Lang... Let's separate for good All right And in old age, Duanmu's version was... Xiao Hong... I'll marry Ding Ling You can marry Duanmu What are you talking about? I don't care who you marry My marriage is none of your business! You're too arrogant! What do you take us for? I'm trying to do you a favor Xiao Jun, don't insult us! Is Xiao Hong an object without feelings? Look at yourself! Get out! Xiao Jun, let's talk outside Given what had happened... ...I had to make known my relationship with Xiao Hong I've broken up with Xiao Jun I've returned all his letters I asked for mine back... ...but he refused He's stronger than me, so I didn't manage... ...to get them back So now you're free I have something to tell you I'm pregnant with Xiao Jun's child Child? Four months Does he know? Of course he does And he asked you to marry me? That's the kind of man he is How could you live with a man like that? He thinks I wouldn't dare marry you because of the child? Come in Sit I want you to have this It's a trophy... ...captured from the Japanese I have nothing to give you The best gift is knowing you Take care! "We spent the whole spring in Xi'an" "We drank our fill..." "...and spent evenings in the wind and rain" "And yet, now that I think back..." "...we didn't talk that much" "There are few people" "you can talk with freely" "Since we said our goodbyes..." "...I've never had a letter from Xiao Hong" "Duanmu has sent several" "The last one arrived before Hong Kong fell to the Japanese" I hear Xiao Hong's ashes are buried in Repulse Bay Do you remember? You once told me... ...that Xiao Hong would die young Now your premonition has come true This is my essay... Remembering Xiao Hong After Xiao Hong and Xiao Jun broke up... ...they never saw each other again That same year, in April 1938... ...Xiao Hong and Duanmu went back to Wuhan Xiao Jun went to Yan'an... ...and then to Xinjiang, to fight the Japanese As he passed through Lanzhou... ...he met Wang Defen He married her that year And they lived together ever after They had eight children in all I parted from Xiao Jun And he went to fight as a guerrilla Now I live with him... As a woman... ...you suffered humiliations You have the right to do what you want It shows how strong you are As your friends... ...we're happy to see you leave your sufferings behind But why be in such a hurry? Why not calm down a little? Did you see Ding Ling in the north-west? How is she? We are very different people Why didn't you go to Yan'an? All I want is to write in peace I don't want to be a Party member I know nothing about politics, nothing at all Please be seated Thank you for coming to our wedding We prepared it in such a rush Please excuse us for the shortcomings Duanmu... These four red beans symbolize mutual longing They were given to me by Mr Lu Xun Today, I give them to you... ...as a token of faith I heard there weren't many guests at the wedding Most of them were Duanmu's relatives Duanmu and I... ...had no great romance It was not until I'd separated from Xiao Jun... ...that I found Duanmu I do not expect too much from him All I want is... ...to live as an ordinary husband and wife No quarrels, no fights... No betrayals, no mockery... Only mutual understanding Only care and kindness between us I feel deeply that a woman in my situation... ...is no position to expect to marry But Duanmu made a sacrifice And that satisfies me I'm deeply grateful In June and July of 1938, the Japanese Army prepared its assault The government announced a campaign to 'Protect Great Wuhan'... But people began to abandon the city They fled to Chungking One rainy day in July... ...I was crossing the river from Wuchang Xiao Hong! I didn't expect you to greet me! I was just thinking... I have no friends of my own They're all Xiao Jun's friends You all belong to him Do you have any plans? The situation is getting critical Many friends are planning to leave Are you going? I have tickets to Chungking I'm going with Luo Feng Let's go together! Shall we? Help me get two tickets At that time, it wasn't easy to get tickets I found one for Xiao Hong But on the day... ...it wasn't Xiao Hong who turned up I have tickets! Where's Xiao Hong? She's not coming She'll take a later steamer I'm going first to look for a house Let's go Xi Jin! What are you doing here? I've come to stay here And Duanmu? He's gone to Chungking Why didn't he take you? I didn't need taking Sit down You can't stay here Listen...I'll explain The two upstairs rooms are for Zhao Ximeng and his family There are two rooms down here Three people are in one of them... ...all crammed into one bed The other is this office It's crowded and noisy here You can't stay here And in your condition... I insist Look... I can sleep here - No, you can't! - I can spread some matting here - You can't live here! - Xi Jin! No, you can't live here! People come and go Apart from anything else... ...you'd be in their way Xi Jin! Thank you! That's how... ...Xiao Hong came to live in our office A pregnant woman stretched out on our floor As to why Duanmu went first and left her behind... ...she didn't say, and I didn't ask Xi Jin! There's a new café! Treat us to iced drinks! It's really hot today I'm broke! If anyone treats, I'll go! I have money! I have money! My treat! My treat Great! You're so late Who's treating? Xiao Hong... Order anything! - Miss! - Here! What would you like? Whatever you want A glass of beer All right I'll have a beer too Shaved ice for me, please Help yourself your change, $2.7 Never mind, keep it Thank you Cheers Are you that rich? Throwing money around like that! Why are you laughing? It's all I have, anyway... it wouldn't help much Better spend it generously Nonsense! Generosity! It made no sense! The nation's in crisis There's chaos everywhere We don't know when Wuhan will fall The Japanese Army is biding its time What will we do if they launch an attack? Think about it! What will you do? Keeping the change would have made no difference! All right You have your way, and I have mine When crisis hits, I might be across the river Unable to help you! If that happens, don't worry Small change wouldn't help anyway Stop blaming me You go back first There's something I must do Don't ask for the money back! Get up, get up! You finally come back Where did you go? I borrowed $150 for you Listen carefully... This is not a gift, it's a loan I borrowed $100 from the Life Bookshop And another $50 from the Reading Press I told them I was borrowing it for you And promised you would pay it back If you don't, then I will What now? Keep it You'll need it No more treating I was still worried So I asked my colleague Naichao for advice I told him we couldn't leave Xiao Hong alone in Wuhan We had to get her away Naichao had an answer He said his wife was leaving for Chungking She could take Xiao Hong I said ok Not long after, I was sent to Canton to start a journal I had to leave At noon that day, Xiao Hong and other friends... ...threw a farewell lunch for me And then they saw me off at the pier After that, I never saw her again Thank you! I fell and I couldn't get up I'm pregnant I've been waiting and waiting You're very kind Thank you! Why are you running around when you're pregnant? Going to Chungking Are you all right? I'm all right Thank you... I don't know how to thank you... I have money... Xiao Hong came to see me when she reached Chungking Back then we lived near the city, in Jiangjin She wanted to have the child in Jiangjin Duanmu wasn't with her For the month she stayed with us... ...she looked pale Sickly... Her spirits were low The landlady has made chicken soup Have some! Not now... I'm not hungry Look at him, tiny nose, tiny lips... He looks just like Xiao Jun! Cute little hand What's wrong with you? Where have you been? Where's the baby? Where is he? Dead What? He was fine yesterday, how can he be dead? I'll get the doctor Don't go Please don't There's no point He died of convulsions last night Bai Lang... I want to be discharged Right now. I'm so scared There was only one doctor on duty last night I'm the only patient left in here Take me away Bai Lang...I hope you'll always be happy You too! Me? Can I be happy? I know my own future I'll be lonely all my life "Mr Lu Xun was recovering" "He sat, smoking, in his reclining chair" "That day..." was wearing a garish red blouse" "Mr Lu Xun said..." "The heat is oppressive today" "They call this the 'plum rain season'..." "He was putting a cigarette" "in his cigarette-holder..." Mr Lu Xun... What do you think of my outfit today? Am I pretty Not so pretty Why not? You're wearing the wrong skirt There is nothing wrong with a red blouse Any color can look good... But a red blouse needs a red skirt Or a black one Miss Xiao! Mr Duanmu! Miss Xiao! Mr Duanmu! Mr Jin! I've brought them rice What should I do? They don't live here any more Keep the rice for yourself How come? They've moved to Hong Kong Come in - Xiao Hong... - Xiao Hong! What a surprise! Xiao Gu... Look who's here! Say "Auntie" - He's grown - Yes Thinner, Taller too Come here...Look at our baby girl She put me through it! Just as well we didn't abort her in Wuhan Or you wouldn't be here now! What happened to her forehead? It was a rat It must have been hungry It nibbled her It's all right She looks so delicate... ...and pretty, just like you Like me? Not like her dad! Xiao Hong... I have something to do, I must go out Of course I'll take the boy. You go on Son, take it with you Give it to me Bye Do sit down Such a mess! What about your baby? It must be big by now It died Three days after it was born How did it die? Was it a boy or a girl? A boy He died of convulsions I fell down on the pier in Yichang I found myself thinking... Child... If you want to drop... Drop out of my body I can't hold on to you But he survived that fine You've fleshed out a bit You look good! Really! You look beautiful in that dress I was stunned when you came in wearing it I made it myself I bought the cloth, the thread and the buttons at the market Look The result isn't too bad, is it? It's elegant, it suits you I always said you have really good taste You can turn any piece of cheap fabric... ...into the most beautiful dress! If you like, I'll make one for you I don't have the energy these days Hey, I must show you something! This came from Xiao Jun, his wedding photo I'm going Give my best to Hu when he gets back Xiao Hong... ZHOU JINGWEN magazine publisher A year after... ...they arrived in Hong Kong... ...Xiao Hong was... ...diagnosed with tuberculosis While she was in the hospital... ...Duanmu took a call from a stranger A man named Luo Binji He claimed to be a friend of Xiao Hong's brother He was stuck in a hotel Looking for work Duanmu turned to me You've been home for a few days... You should go back to hospital This isn't a good environment for you Don't be too willful I'd rather die than go back I was bored stiff there They wouldn't even let me write It's a matter of priorities Mr Zhou... I'm not sure I can finish my novel Ma Bole... Can you announce that I'm ill in the magazine? As excuse A famous woman writer... ...confined to a shabby, old bed The whole scene... ...made me feel really sad Soon after that, without warning... ...the Pacific War began on December 7th By Luo Binji's own account... ...he was with Xiao Hong in her final days Five years later... ...he was the first to write a biography of her The Japanese began shelling Hong Kong on December 8th, 1941 That day I went to say goodbye before returning to the mainland You're intent on leaving? I'll be back soon I came to say goodbye I'm going back to China I have to go... to discuss if we should leave too Please stay here a while I'll be back soon I'm so tired... Hold my hand I want to take a nap I feel much better... Apparently, just before I arrived... ...Duanmu and Xiao Hong had been having a bitter row Wake up! Mr Yu Yifu had arranged a boat... ...to get us to Hong Kong island, not yet occupied by the Japanese Sea traffic is now officially blocked Has our retreat been worked out? My colleague Liao has divided all the cultural people into groups He's explained our plans And has specified who will lead each group You and Xiao Hong are in my group ...so I'm afraid you have no choice but to stay Luo Binji... Before you met me... ...did you think that I was a writer with loose morals? I think everyone has heard a little about... ...your troubles with Xiao Jun So, before you met me... ...you sided with Xiao Jun? I know very well... ...that leaving Xiao Jun... ...solved one problem And that Duanmu was the start of another problem Probably, everybody wears disguises Nobody ever shows their true face I've been thinking... I can't tell if anyone will read my stuff later But I'm quite sure... ...that the gossip about me will go on and on As we chatted that morning, I asked Xiao Hong... How could you live with Duanmu for three or four years? Xiao Hong replied... If the pain is in the marrow... ...you don't worry about the flesh wounds He cannot endure the hardships with me When I was in Sichuan... ...I found myself thinking of Xiao Jun If I'd sent him a telegram... ...asking him to come... ...he would have been there for me Amid the sound of artillery shells... ...we talked about literature... About Lu Xun... About living through such hard times We hadn't seen Duanmu for three or four days You're back! You haven't left? Sorry...Thank you Sorry...Thank you, thank you Good bye On Christmas Day of 1941, Hong Kong fell to the Japanese After hiding for some days in a storeroom... ...Xiao Hong's condition worsened Duanmu and I sent her to a hospital Considering what's going on around us... I told Duanmu ...I'll be frank You're both famous artists You have open minds You have a tumor in your throat We need to operate I won't agree to an operation A tuberculosis patient won't recover from it My brother had spinal tuberculosis... And he didn't recover from an operation Who do you believe? Me? Or him? Don't pussyfoot around It's not the end of the world Sign the consent I won't If you won't, I will What did she say? There was no tumor Don't cry I don't want... ...to leave you either Come with me... I'll contact Queen Mary Hospital At noon on January 18th, 1942... ...Xiao Hong was moved to Queen Mary Hospital I feel quite all right I've eaten a lot Luo Binji... Have a cigarette Have one I won't It's all right I don't want one No light? I'll call for one All right, all right Call the nurse Don't exert yourself It's done Wait, the nurse will come There's nobody in the whole hospital I'll go and buy matches I intended to buy matches from a street-stall But as I wandered downtown, it struck me... ...that I hadn't been back to Kowloon since the city was occupied Duanmu was with Xiao Hong And she seemed better that day So I went home to pick up my manuscripts I went back to Queen Mary Hospital next morning... ...to find that the Japanese had taken it over So I rushed back to the storeroom... ...and there found a note Duanmu had left for me Duanmu had taken Xiao Hong to the French Hospital... The Japanese have taken the French Hospital too Where's Xiao Hong? They've set up a clinic at St Stephen's Girls College "My grandfather lived in the little town on the Hulan River” "Grandfather was over sixty when I was born" "He was nearly seventy by the time I was four or five" "Our house had a big garden" "The garden was bright with all the reds and greens" "Flowers bloomed as if they were waking up" "Birds flew as if they were going up to heaven" ”When insects buzzed, it was as if they were chatting" Everything was alive "There was no limit to what they could do" "They had complete freedom" "to do what they liked" "If a plant wanted to bear a fruit, it did so” "If it didn't," "then not one fruit, not even a blossom" "And no-one could object" "But this back garden was sealed off once each year” ”After the autumnal rains, it would languish" ”The flowers would yellow and fall, ” "then wither and die" "Almost as if someone was crushing them" "Spring, summer, autumn, winter..." "The seasonal cycle goes on "just as it has since the beginning of time" "Wind, frost, rain, snow..." "Those who can bear up manage to survive" ”Those who cannot must take the natural way out" "That natural way out is not so very good" "For such people are quietly..." "Wordlessly. . . " "...removed from this life and this world" Xiao Hong wrote Tales of Hulan River in 1941... ...at a time when most Chinese writers... ...were producing writings contributing to the anti-Japanese war effort Tales of Hulan River didn't meet the needs of the time All these decades later, now that we're far from China in wartime... ...people have discovered that Tales of Hulan River... ...is like an undying flower which had been buried by history This choice that she made for herself... ...had made her name immortal "These tales I've written are not all beautiful” "But these memories fill me" "I cannot forget them" "They stay with me" "And so I have recorded them here" Hey, feller, the candies are two cents, not one!
