A DAIEI CO. LTD. PRODUCTION A KATSU PRODUCTIONS FILM I've got blood on my hands again. I'm done with hell. I can feel the gusts blowing right through my body. Enough with the rain. And the wind. I remember the spring breeze, the sound of the stream... and the sweet scent of plum blossoms. My home was a divine place. It's only been two years. Or was it three? ZATOICHI MEETS YOJIMBO Produced by SHINTARO KATSU and HIROYOSHI NISHIOKA Original Story by KAN SHIMOZAWA Screenplay by KIHACHI OKAMOTO AND TETSURO YOSHIDA Cinematography by KAZUO MIYAGAWA Art Direction by YOSHINOBU NISHIOKA Original Music by AKIRA IFUKUBE Edited by TOSHIO TANIGUCHI Starring: SHINTARO KATSU AYAKO WAKAO OSAMU TAKIZAWA MASAKANE YONEKURA, SHIN KISHIDA, KANJURO ARASHI SHIGERU KOYAMA TOSHIYUKI HOSOKAWA MINORI TERADA, HIDEO SUNAZUKA, DAIGO KUSANO TOSHIRO MIFUNE Directed by KIHACHI OKAMOTO I smell the plum blossoms. I hear the stream. I feel the spring breeze. This is nice. I'm home. I'm back home. I've reached the edge of my hometown. That sound must be Tome. It sounds nice. Just like it was three years ago. What are you making, Tome? A plow? A hoe? Or a sickle? No, it's none of those. It's something longer. About one yard long. I guessed right. Could that piece be... Hey, Tome. Why are you making such a deadly thing? I see. It may be peaceful in my hometown, but it's good to be prepared. Just in case. Why don't you make one for me? It's not sharp. Not made for killing. As long as it can slice a radish. I'm too busy. Make one for me when you have time. I probably won't use it here anyway. Why did you come back here? Why? Just to take a break. - Relaxation. - You won't get that here. I want to enjoy the open-air hot spring. The open-air hot spring you say? To feel the spring breeze. To hear the stream. To savor the sweet scent of the plum blossoms. To listen to the nightingale's song. And to just sink down into the tub. - Hey. - Yes? You're only tickling me. Is that so? Do people pay you for this? You don't even know the precise points. I'm sorry. It hasn't even been a year since I suddenly went blind. That's why ‒ That's why you steal people's clothes at bathhouses. No, I don't do that. You don't need to leave. I'll show you the proper way to massage. If I remember correctly, this town was managed by... the old man, Hyoroku. Is he well? Hyoroku? Oh, the man who makes coffins. He makes coffins? Yes, sir. He's always carving Buddhist monks out of stone. The depressing old man. I remember him as a happy man. He was always cheerful and gentle-mannered. He was the headman in this town. You must be mistaking him for someone else. All he does is carve stone statues of Buddhist monks. This town is managed by Masagoro, boss of the Kobotoke family. You're new here. Yes, I am. Who gave you permission to do business? I'm not doing any business here. Then what is it you're doing here? I'm learning how to give massages from this master here. Is that right? Good timing. We just finished our baths. Practice on us. - Goon. Hurry it up. I hesitate because I'm not trained at all. Just shut up and do it! Okay then. Then let me start with you. How did that feel? Who the hell are you? I'm just an amateur masseur. They call me... Zatoichi. What? Zatoichi? Is that what he said his name was? Yes, sir. Damn it. Sensei! Did you say a violent criminal with a bounty of 100 ryo on his head? I'll do it. What? A blind masseur? Then I'm not interested. I don't want to be haunted by him. Sensei! He dislocated our shoulders. Sensei! Please do something to help us. One ryo each. If you don't have that, I'll take one bun now. I hope no one is watching us. Are you telling the truth about being blind? Being blind is actually the truth. That's good. This place may be hell, but there's lots of money here. Oh, nothing. Let's keep going. Yo... Yo... Yojim...? Hey, blind bastard! Blind bastard! Zatoichi, or whatever your name is. Help me earn 100 ryo. Hey, where did you go? There you are, my 100 ryo. Don't you run away. Don't make a move. You'll be sorry if you do. You won't feel any pain when I kill you. But don't come haunt me later. Don't you haunt me. There's my 100 ryo! What the hell? You're a monster! You're a beast. I like you. You're definitely worth 100 ryo. I'm prepared to kill you anytime. Is that so? Then I'll be prepared anytime. I've had too much to drink today. But that won't be the case next time. Hey, follow me. Let's go get a drink. I'd like to follow you, but as you can see... You're blind. You're a real piece of work. And this blind fellow is dead with his eyes open. Don't look at me like that. Look the other way. Who did the killing? Any witnesses? Who did it? Who killed him? By the way, do you have any money on you? Yes, I have some. Sounds good. Let's go inside. We want sake. Give us some sake. Just bring a barrel. The sweet smell of plum blossoms. Now I remember. Is that you? Umeno? Do you remember me? I don't think so. Are you sure? It was only three years ago when I saw you last. Then that was a long time ago. Come on in, masseur. - Your hand. - Sorry? Your warm hand is just as I remember. Three years ago... you used to pull my hand just like this. Don't touch her! Don't yell, bodyguard! I don't like men who yell. I also don't like men who only visit when they're drunk. And I despise men who don't pay what they owe. What I owe? I'll pay it off. I have 100 ryo tonight. - Where? - Right there. He's sitting there smiling. Stop smiling! His name is Zatoichi. He's worth 100 ryo. I'm prepared to kill you anytime. Let's forget about that now. Let's enjoy our drink tonight. Umeno. I remember your parents. Are they well? They're dead. The good die first and only the crooks survive. This is no place for an innocent masseur. Are you talking about me? But Umeno, you're... I'm one of the crooks. That's right. This woman can be quite vicious. She uses yakuza, officials and townsmen. She doesn't care who it is as long as she gets the money. Yours truly here is quite a crook, too. I can outdo the best of them. I'm at the top when it comes to being bad. A villain. How do you like that? Actually, I'm quite a crook as well. If you are, then behave like one. Madam, come to the annex. Mr. Eboshiya is visiting. I'll go check. Eboshiya. Such an arrogant jerk. I don't like his attitude. May I help you? Zatoichi, you're needed at the guard station. What did I do? You're a wanted criminal. So you know about that. We need to question you about the dead masseur. I had nothing to do with that. Save your excuses for the guard. Come with us. No need. Tozo, I won't let you take him. He's my 100 ryo. I won't let you take that from me. Mister, calm down. Don't make a scene in Umeno's place. Let's keep things peaceful, at least while we're here. Thanks for the drink. - Hold on. - Yes? You said you've got some money. Leave it here. Yes. I have some money. Masseur, the master wants your service. That masseur. Don't haunt me. So my head will be hung high on the prison gate. That's right. The head inspector will be arriving in a few days. You'll be dead then. Ouch. He's either drunk or snoring away. No good for anything. Where are you going? The guard station is this way. I'm thinking about my head hanging high on the gate. I'm actually afraid of heights. What did you say? Masagoro. I hope you understand what I"m asking you. It's a request from your father. That's what you wanted to see me for. I'm leaving. Wait. I know pretty much everything. I know all about Tokubei. People say he was killed fighting over Umeno. But I know it was you who was behind his killing. Then let's just get to the point. Where are you hiding the bar of gold? How many times do I have to tell you? I don't have any gold. I know what you're thinking. You're planning on giving it to my younger brother, Sanemon. But such a thing doesn't even exist to begin with. Don't you trust your own father? My father? Stop your nonsense! Masagoro. What are you going to do... when the guys who killed Tokubei talk to the head inspector? That was ten years ago. Have you forgotten you cut me off from the family? Hey, masseur. Yes? I'm one of the young ones of the Kobotoke family, Yogo. What are you in here for? Bedroom theft? Stealing clothes? None of those. Just for a petty crime. And what about you? I'm in for killing, of course. I killed someone last night. You killed someone? It must feel good to have killed a person. Expecting someone? My brothers are supposed to bail me out. I doubt they'll come. What do you mean? They can't come tonight, but they'll be here tomorrow morning. See this? I told you. My brothers sent food over. Plums. I smell dried plums. Excuse me, but would you share one with me? Sure. There you go. Meeting you like this has to be fate. The more the merrier. Young man, did you spill something? You need to help me. Why did you commit murder? Who did you kill anyway? A salesclerk of Eboshiya. But I didn't do it. I'm only an underling. Three brothers did the killing. All I did was dump the body in the river. Please save me, masseur. That masseur! What are you screaming about? He's haunting me. What's gotten into you? Can I stay here tonight? You're already staying here. It's almost dawn. Tell me if you want to sleep with me. I want you badly. You must have killed someone in your dream. And now you're scared so you want me. Are you going to pay me? Sure, but I don't have anything right now. I owe you. Then how about killing Masagoro for me? Masagoro? That's right. I hate him for what he did to me. I couldn't even talk to Zatoichi. Will you kill him or not? I'll get 100 ryo if I kill Zatoichi. But killing Masagoro won't do me any good. I take refuge in... The Buddha! Don't be stupid. You're awake. You're only young once. Once is enough. I know they'll cut my head off. I'd rather hang myself. Hey, masseur. How can you stay so calm? Give me a break. I couldn't sleep at all last night. Just like you last night, I'm scared about my head being hung from the gate. I had to stop myself from wetting my pants. Heads hanging from the gate. I wonder when the head inspector will arrive here. That's it for us. We could put an end to it now. What? With you? No, I don't like that. If I could die together with Umeno, I'd do it. But I don't want to die with you. That's not what I want either. Let me make myself clear. We can eat those poisoned rice balls. I don't like that either. We'd suffer. Just like the mouse that clawed at his throat. That's it. I suggest we both do that. Together. Did we get here too late? Open it now! Make him vomit. We can't let him die! Why can't you let me die? Why did you do such a stupid thing? You're to be released! What has caused this turn of events? Wait a minute. You... How's my acting? What happened anyway? Someone requested your release. But only on one condition. You must leave the village. I appreciate it. Yogo? Hey, Yogo ran away. That bastard! Get him! Hurry up! Excuse me, where are my things? Ichi. That voice must belong to the old man, Hyoroku. That's right, Ichi. I'm happy to see you back in this village. Your hand is cold. How come your hand is cold? Old man, let me tell you how I feel. I think it's better I forget about this village. It"ll be safer. Are you leaving, Ichi? I think it's better that way. I want you to stay a bit longer, Ichi. In this village full of cold-hearted people? To be honest, it was my fault. I made this village the way it is now. It all started with the horrible drought we had two years ago. All the villages in this area were affected. We had a terrible famine. People were feeding on mice and moles. Fortunately, our village had some reserves. I thought we could survive the winter. But the others found out about our reserves. And the starved swarmed into the village. We were attacked by people who were just like ants. I was desperate to protect the villagers. So I invited the yakuza, the Kobotoke family, to our village. It was just like hell. Just thinking about it makes my hair stand on end. It was here in this very spot. The lives of 130 people were taken. They were no more than skin and bones. Ever since then, the Kobotoke family has been ruling the village. Ichi, the village is the way it is now... because the dead put a curse on us. I can't get that thought out of my mind. What a catastrophe. But there's nothing I can do to help you. I just want you to stay. People have changed. They stopped talking to each other. There's no laughter in the village. People don't smile anymore. I want someone who knows about the past of this village. So the person who paid off the guard to get me out of prison was... No, that wasn't me. It was the master of Eboshiya, the silk wholesaler. Ichi, we're here. This is the place. Old man, I know this place. You have a good memory. It used be my house, but the master bought it from me. Let's go inside. He's waiting for you. The master is on the fourth floor. Did you say the fourth floor? Hey, look. Thanks for coming, Ichi. Master, I truly appreciate the generous arrangements you made. No, I'm the one who has to thank you for coming here. A good masseur is hard to come by. Shall we get started then? Sounds good. I'm not sure I can give you satisfactory service. Anyway, let me get started with the massage. Feels good. It's nice to have a pro work on me. I'm feeling refreshed already. That's good to hear. I hope you don't regret the cost of this treatment. There are things in this world money can't buy. I hope you'll come see me every day. I appreciate your patronage. But as you know... how shall I say this? This place has lost its charm. It no longer has the warmth it once had. You're absolutely right. This place used to be like a paradise. Three years ago, you weren't... That's right. I wasn't here. I was traveling with my now-deceased wife selling luxury items. That explains it. I can sense the hard work your body has endured. How did you end up here? Just like you. I couldn't let go of its charm. I decided to settle here two years ago. Why don't you do the same in this village? Did you say Zatoichi has become Eboshiya's bodyguard? Yes. You know how expensive he is? He'll cost you 200 ryo. What? 200 ryo? Don't be so greedy. But you're dealing with a greedy man. Where are you going? I'll get money somewhere else. Sensei! Don't worry. I'll be back soon. Make sure you have 200 ryo by the time I come back. Hey, Ichi. I need you to share your wisdom on something. My wisdom? I may have a cane, but I have no wisdom to share. You'll be compensated appropriately for what you offer. As they say, you can't get something for nothing. You'll settle down in this village, won't you? I only have one life. I want it to last a long time. I guess you're not going to accept my request. But I hope you'll at least stay for a few days. Yes. It'd be nice to rest up for a few days. I'll then continue on with my journey. I hope you won't mind me sticking around during that time, Master. Where is Yasuke Eboshiya? It's that beast. Master! Kobotoke's bodyguard says he needs you. I don't need to see him. Just ask him to leave politely. Yes, Sir. That's plenty for today. I feel much better. Ichi. They come to threaten me every day. I don't know what to do. I can feel the stress. Does this man have an injury on his left shin? How do you know that? And that man right there... has a crack on his third rib on the right side. I smell something burning. Out of my way. Ouch! Hot! Hot! A fire! A big fire! Master! Master! Calm down, Soshichi. Tell everyone to leave immediately. It's a fire! A big fire! A fire! I'm here to receive my reward. For what? Don't act dumb. I'm the one who told your clerk about the identity of your fake masseur. I want 50 ryo. But I'll take 5 ryo now. I have no idea what you're referring to. I hope this is enough for you to leave us alone today. Hey, put it out now. Hurry up! We don't want to cause a fire. Hey, watch your step. A little to the left. To the left. Thank you. You're very kind. You fool. You're one cruel man. You're a cat in tiger's skin. You must have enjoyed playing a joke on a cripple. Why don't you make me a cripple then? Or a legless man? I'd be glad to. Just wait and see. Wait and see? Tell me something. I'll get 200 ryo for killing you. How much is Eboshiya paying you for me? He hasn't said. What? Are you working for free? That's not good. I don't like the ones that get in my way. But I hate the ones that make others work for free. It stinks. Hey, blind bastard! Blind bastard! Blind bastard? Once is acceptable. What did you say, blind bastard? Twice is bearable. But three times? What's wrong with it? At least it's clear if I'm your friend or foe. Look at me. Blind bastard! Blind bastard! Blind bastard! You just proved your worth of 200 ryo. Hey, blind bastard, look at me. Hey, Ichi. What's the matter? I can't see. I'm fine with not being able to see. Don't tease me like that. It'll leave a bitter taste if you kill me now. I don't have any problem with that. Don't be like that. Blind bastard! Are we going to do it or not? Big Brother! Boss! I mean, Sensei! “When the wind picks up, the coffin shop makes money.” It appears that was a true statement. I'm warning you... that you'll get an order for four coffins very soon. Ichi, are you saying...? Yes, I've decided to stay in this village for a while. Ichi. I worry about Umeno, who's been harassed by that beast. That beast? There's one more thing... that doesn't sit well with me. What's that? That man. I'm talking about Eboshiya. Master, the inspector, Mr. Wakiya, will be arriving in a few days. Why not use the government to get rid of Kobotoke? I can't do that. I may have cut ties with Masagoro, but he's still my son. I can't allow his head to be hung on the gate. But we have to do something. Our problem is the bodyguard. If we can take down that ronin, that'd help Masagoro... Hello! Where is it from? The young master. It's from the young master in Edo. Sensei. Do you really think my old man is hiding a bar of gold? If you don't believe it, I'll handle things myself. Sensei! But it's not in that house. What? I thought smoke might make them run off with the gold. But nobody was carrying anything of the sort, not even a wooden stick. That's why it can't be there. Then... But I know it exists. It has to be somewhere. Do you want to hear the secret of the bar of gold? - Of course I do. - Give me ten ryo. But I can take one ryo now. Eboshiya has one more son who is younger than Masagoro. This son was studying medicine in Kyoto. He is quite shrewd, unlike his older brother. His talent was recognized by the family that controls the gold guild. He married into the Goto family. The one that controls the gold guild. That's when Eboshiya's good fortune started. The Goto family has handled the minting of gold coins for generations. What would happen if they had cheated on the gold at each stage of minting? If you want to know the rest, give me 20 ryo. Or give me two ryo right now. Old man, I'm penniless. I'll go make a few ryo right now. I'll go to Kobotoke's gambling house and tease them a bit. Don't be that way, Ichi. My place may not be clean, but I won't charge you to stay here. I appreciate that. But yakuza must not accept favors from honest men. After all, I'm a blind nomad who never stays in one place. Another time. Hey, mister. Mr. Bodyguard, where are you off to? To Umenoya. Wait. What about you? To the gambling house to make three ryo. The gambling house? I have a favor to ask you. What favor? Can you lend me two bu to play with? Two bu? I don't have any small change. Unfortunately, all I have are big coins. I have three ryo here. What a beautiful color. This color is called golden yellow. I'll borrow this from you. I don't think this coin is of the best quality. The taste has changed, too. Bet, please. Even! Not quite enough for Odd. Are you ready? Bet, please. They're all lined up. Bet now! The total is an odd number! I didn't do as well as expected. Zatoichi, why don't you roll the dice next? Do you want me to? I'm not sure if I can roll well since I'm blind. Just roll them. If you insist. Ru try... as long as I can play one-on-one against you. Just roll them already! Okay, then the dice go in the cup. Boss, are you ready”? I'm putting them down. Please make your bet now, Boss. I say even. You're Boss Masagoro of Kobotoke. Is that all you're betting? That's more like the wager a fearless Boss would make. Showdown! An odd number. Don't come near me, monster. Just sit over there. I came to give you back the money you lent me. Thank you, Beast. Is Umeno here? You're not worthy of saying her name. Did you sleep with her? No, she kindly held my hand and guided me. That's all. I figured. She wouldn't sleep with a monster. But she has changed. Are you saying she would sleep with a monster now? She doesn't care who she sleeps with. She'd sleep with Masagoro. Even Tozo, the watchman. She's with Yasuke at Eboshiya all night tonight. I'm sure she has her reasons to have to do so. I remember the warmth of Umeno's hand. I'm sure she still has the same warmth. Shut up! She's turned totally greedy. Money, money, money. That's what everybody wants. You shut up. Yasuke might have lent her 200 ryo, but she doesn't have to sell her body. She's a prostitute! A whore! I didn't know you were a crying drunk. Shut your mouth! Just shut it! Sensei, we need you to help us. We'll handle it on our own. I'd think that would be a difficult task for a woman. But it can be done precisely because I'm a woman. I must return what I owe before I can undertake what I want to do. Sounds like there's someone you care for greatly. You're wrong. I know Masagoro's bodyguard is hanging around with you. Who could fall for such a beast! Is that how you really feel? What I want to do is destroy the yakuza of all yakuzas. You're referring to Masagoro. I apologize, Umeno. That's why I paid you 200 ryo as compensation. I gave that money to you. No need to pay it back. I'm willing to help you in any way I can. I appreciate your concern. That's more than enough. I wouldn't want to see any bloodshed between a father and son. But even those blood ties have their limits. I've asked Zatoichi to stay in this village. Ichi? A wandering yakuza named Kuzuryu will be arriving here any day. Kuzuryu? His names stands for nine-headed dragon. My son in Edo is sending this fellow to protect me. Apparently, he's quite skilled and vicious. And he brings a nine-headed dragon with him. Kuzuryu... Good evening. I'd like to stay here starting tonight if that's fine with you. What did you say? As you know, I was a wanted criminal. So it's better for me to stay where the officials can keep an eye on me. I appreciate your understanding. ll won't be a bother. Thank you kindly. I know my way around. Sensei. Sensei? Can you teach me how to skillfully use the cane sword like you? I brought one here. I got it from Tome, the blacksmith. He told me it's yours. There's no need for you to learn. It's a skill for a cripple. Your body is in good health. I suggest you find a respectable job. I didn't expect to be lectured by a masseur. I have a job that I'm working hard at. Not sure you'd call it a respectable job, but I protect the madam at Umenoya. You protect Umeno? Actually, it's my secret. No one knows about it. That's why I need to learn those skills. I won't ask you anymore. His secret. No one knows about it. There's a fire at Eboshiya's storehouse! What? Help! EBOSHIYA Madam. Well, well. He looks so innocent when he's sleeping. Don't catch cold, sweet boy. Madam, a yakuza I've never seen before was looking for the bodyguard. A yakuza you've never seen... Kuzuryu. Kuzuryu? Never heard of him. I'm trying to help you. There was so much commotion tonight. A fire, a brawl and a wanted criminal. Just when the head inspector is about to arrive. Good morning. Dried mackerel and miso soup with ginger. Warm rice with pickled wasabi on top. What a nice breakfast. Chopsticks? Where are my chopsticks? There they are. Thank you for the meal. Tasty. Very nice. Why are you making so much noise this early? We're getting ready to take revenge for last night. Revenge? Sensei, that storehouse was completely empty. So it's not at his store nor at his storehouse. Are you sure it really exists, Sensei? Boss! The inspector is coming. He's now at the mountain pass. The inspector... What to do? I don't have time for him. I'm busy. Hold on. The inspector could be useful to us. What are you suggesting? His position allows him to use all of his connections in Edo. It would be easy for him to transport a bar or two of gold. Let's go see him. I hate to tell you this, but you can't stay here. A wanted criminal can't be hanging around here. What if the inspector sees this? How do I explain it? So do me a favor and leave this place. Where's my tea? - Is he here? - Yes, Sir. Tozo, something serious is going on. The residences of the gold guild controller and the finance commissioner are being investigated. There wasn't enough evidence, so they're safe for now. But the chief officer is getting involved. The chief officer? If they find evidence, it could mean trouble... from the finance commissioner down to the watchman. If you're lucky, you'll be exiled. Or you could be beheaded. You must leave this place immediately. Don't waste any time. You heard him, didn't you? If you're lucky, you'll be exiled. Or you could be beheaded. Was he talking about me? Listen, Eboshiya. This ends our relationship. I hope that item is hidden very well. I'm the only one who knows. The inspector-general may get involved. Take caution. Where are you off to, Master Wakiya? You're the only one who knows. Ichi, where are you going? The sound of the rain throws my senses off. I was about to pass you by. Seems like the rain won't let up. I'm going to see the Master to give him a massage. I see, to Eboshiya. He's a very respectable man. He's the one who ordered these statues made to honor the dead. And he plans on building a temple there. He'll build a temple? He'll take care of all the expenses. That's why he's working hard to save money. He's saving money. This one makes the 129th statue. I only have one more to go to realize my wish. Then I will have no regrets. Old man, are you not feeling well? I sense a weakness in your voice. No, it's just your imagination. Remember not to Kill the head inspector. We need him alive. Here they come. Hold on. Kunai. Hey, Kunai Atobe. So you're Kuzuryu. A spy is hired to uncover a secret. And another is sent to go after the spy. I thought you might show up. Am I correct to assume Kuwabara who went after you is now dead? I ended him. Not personally, but I had him killed. Why? Because he was interfering with my work. I was sent here because you take too long with your work. And, is it what you expected? Sasa. Looks like you're focused on the bar of gold and not the evidence you need. What if I am? I'll kill you. You'll kill me? What arrogance! You'll kill me. What a joke. Ouch... Good find. That's what they call easy money. Thief. What? You were watching? No, I was listening. I was following the inspector to see if anything interesting might happen. But I wasn't expecting this scene. As you know, I'm quite a crook myself. So... I'm thinking of becoming a villain, just like you suggest. I have the disadvantage of being blind. But my hearing, sense of smell and sense of taste are keen. Thank you. I like you, Zatoichi. Why not be my partner? Your partner? If we combine my skills and your keen senses, we can handle any big job. Are you talking about the bar of gold? That's it. You find out where it's hidden. I'll get rid of everything in our way. What do you say? Do you want to work with me? What if I decline? I'll kill you. That's what I thought. Well then, I'll work until I make 100 ryo. No, actually, 200 ryo. 200 ryo? Why put a limit on it? There's something that won't let me trust you completely. What did you say? That fake masseur said “Yojim” with his last breath. I think he was trying to ‒ - Will you work with me or not? I said I'd work until to 200 ryo if I get to be a villain. But if your plan is to make me a spy, I won't do it even if you kill me. You won't be a spy. Mole, private detective, spy. Those words disgust me. I understand. You'll be a villain. Let's not waste any more time. Where do you think we should start? I think... we should start with Tozo, the watchman. Kunai was here. - I think it was Kuzuryu. - It's the same person. Kunai Atobe is the spy. And Kuzuryu was sent by Eboshiya. I don't care which one. Let's move on to the next. Where should we go? Let's make our plans over a cup of tea. Listen, Ichi. I couldn't even afford tea in Edo. I could barely feed myself on what I made. While some enjoyed broiled eels, I would get the scrapings off the sticks. I guess samurai's salaries can vary widely. Some can't even afford a bride. Is that why you're after Umeno? You don't have to tell me. I can sense that... Umeno cares for you. It's just the hunch of a blind man. Save your hunches for the bar of gold. Mister. What are you planning to do with Umeno? None of your business. Just focus on our next move. I think I should go after Eboshiya. What did you say? You go after Kobotoke and I'll go after Eboshiya. We can provoke both of them so that they'll go after each other. Something might come out of that. I like that. Let's do it. Ichi, stop by my place on your way back. There's something I need to tell you. Come as soon as you're done with your massage. Hello. Can somebody help me? Please tell the Master that his masseur is here. If possible, I'd prefer the first floor or the second floor. The Master is on the second floor. Let me take your hand. Your hand feels very cold. Thank you for your kindness. I'm not doing this out of kindness. Sorry? Zatoichi is working with Kuzuryu? What does that mean for us then? We should just flee. Please be serious. Masagoro, listen. I don't mean to repeat myself, but you know that money talks. Anyone will buckle if you show them money. That goes for Ichi and Kuzuryu. I dare you to bring 200 ryo and put it right in front of me. Be a man. Hey, old man. We heard there's a brawl. Know where it is? I don't care which side as long as we make money. Which side is stronger? Which side would win us money? Here's 100 ryo. Ichi, this is only a deposit. I'll get you the rest later... when you bring me the goods, which is the bodyguard. This is how we businessmen conduct our transactions. I hope you don't mind. Of course not. Thank you. I don't mean to make this a condition, but I want you to start living here together with Kuzuryu. Of course. Thank you. Why don't we get started with your massage? Okay. On a completely different subject, there's a rumor going around. Have you heard people talking about the declining quality of the gold coins? Do you know anything about it? We businessmen have to deal with money, so it could affect our business. What's your opinion of the quality of recent gold coins? I don't think they're of good quality. If the gold coins lose value, things will get more expensive. When things get more expensive, the poor who are barely making it now will suffer even more. That's logical, isn't it? You're absolutely correct. Ichi, you're quite intelligent. No, I just pick up knowledge by listening to others. Here's another thing I heard. The quality of gold coins can vary... depending on the discretion of the gold guild controller. I hear he has that power. Ichi, what are you trying to... Based on his discretion, I heard 60,000 ryo of gold can be stashed away. What are you trying to say? The current gold guild controller, the third generation Suemon Goto, is your son who married into the Goto family. I thought maybe you'd let me borrow another 100 ryo up-front. I doubt that'd be a difficult task for you. Ichi, I didn't know you were such a crook. But I'm no match for you. I hear you. I'll give you another 100 ryo as a deposit. Old Man. Old Man, Hyoroku. Old Man? What happened, Ichi? I don't know who, but someone did a despicable thing. Just shut up and do something about it! Who do you think took in a poor farm girl and made her into what you are today? It was you who destroyed me like this. What! You're foolish to think I'd have such large amount of money. Not you. I'm talking about my father. Just sleep with him and he'll give you 200, no, 300 ryo. No! What did you say? I won't do that. I'm working my fingers to the bone to pay back 200 ryo. You won't help me then? Not even if I die! Then die! I'll kill you! What the hell? You bastard. No! Sensei! Boss. I have the money right here. The reason you need 200 ryo... is to give it to the bodyguard. Isn't that right? That means it'll eventually come back here. Let's take the shortcut. I'll give this to Umeno now. Ichi... The bodyguard gave this to me for you. I've handed it off to you. Hey, you're Kobotoke's Boss. - We're here to assist in the brawl. - Hire us. - We're good. - We're cheap, too. I don't need you! You may need them. What? They're probably making quite a scene at the Renge Bathhouse by now. Let's attack! Sasa. You just lie around and drink. Don't you ever take your job seriously? I get by. The chief officer will be arriving. We must find evidence or they'll accuse us. Just sit back and watch. I've tricked the blind man into sniffing around. You have to handle all sorts of demons with these little hands. That's right, Ichi. I just hope all those demons kill each other. I agree. They should all go back to hell. But I don't want you to go with them. You must leave now with the bodyguard, if you want to guard your life. What? That was bad. Pardon the pun. Sensei! You weren't doing your job and look what happened! I'll give you that whore, so I want you just to do your job! Sensei! Calm down. How many? Seven dead and 13 injured. 20 men total. You can gather that many in no time. Just show one ryo and you'll have no problem getting men. That's right! I remember those young ones. There were about ten of them. Gon, Matsu and Tsune, go find them. Yes, Sir. Again? What do you need the money for? I don't know how you pulled it off, but you made Zatoichi deliver 200 ryo to Umeno. What did you just say? Are you sure about that? So you insist. As they say, “All things begin and end with money.” Yes, the weight is off my shoulders now. Then will you go off with that bodyguard? I don't know about that. Listen, Umeno. Don't leave me alone. I could get killed... by my own son, Masagoro. I'm lonely. If I lose you now, I'll be alone. But you have one other son. He's the apple of your eye. Hey, Kuzuryu, how's my father? He's quite healthy for his age. - And my older brother? - He's doing quite well. He's so full of energy he could cause a storm tonight or tomorrow morning. Sensei, you should stop drinking. You won't be able to do your job. Just shut up. Nothing will happen tonight. Why do you ruin my mood each time? The sake tastes bad now. Damn it. Hey. Shall we just leave this village? I was thinking it over. Really? That's what Ichi said we should do. He did? Then I won't do it. Why not? That bastard. That blind man made 200 ryo in one day, while I've been struggling to make the same amount in a year. Damn that monster. But you know he did that for us. Shut up. Go on your own if you wish. I can't run away from this place. Even if I did, there's someone who'll come after me for life. Where are you keeping it? Calm down, Sanemon. Why all of a sudden? They're coming after me. Without any proof, even the inspector-general can't charge you with anything. Just let the dust settle. All you have to do is feign ignorance until then. But the authorities will eventually come here. Don't worry. There was a spy here, but he's gone. And there was one other person who knew where it's hidden. He's gone as of today. So there's nothing for you to worry about, Sanemon. Then why won't you... I mean... that gold belongs to me. I know that. I have no use for it since I won't live that long. Then why don't you tell me where it's hidden? If you knew, would you be able to feign ignorance? A normal person can't do that. That's why I won't go near where it's hidden. I can't imagine you could pull it off, especially when you're upset like you are now. All ll want is... I just don't want anybody else to grab something that took me years to get. That's my only wish. I know I can't stop you. But I'll wait for you with my bag packed up. I hope you and Ichi don't kill each other. And please be careful. I heard Kuzuryu uses something called a nine-headed dragon. What he said has been bothering me. “Stop by my place on your way back. There's something I need to tell you.” Time to kill! Things are starting to heat up. Let them all kill each other. But it bothers me. Sensei, I don't know what to do now. You go stay by Umeno. Wait. Hold on. Take me to Hyoroku's place first. There's something bothering me. Hey, you morons, what are you doing there? Get out there and fight or I'll kill you all! Come on, follow me! Don't you leave Umeno, you got that? Ichi, what the hell are you doing here? I take refuge in the Buddha. Paying your respects to the dead Old Man. You put dirt on my face with that 200 ryo. I'm done with our 200-ryo relationship. But you're behaving like a two-bit samurai today. That's right. The kind you despise the most. Just keep rubbing that statue's head and saying your prayers. I don't want to see a blind man hovering around. I take refuge in the Buddha. I take refuge in the Buddha. Sensei! Hey. Do you work for the Kobotoke family? No, we were just hired for this fight for one ryo. Please give us a break. Hired for one ryo? I'll tell you about something much bigger than one ryo. How about hunting for gold? Did you say gold? Actually, we're more interested in staying alive than money or gold. This isn't dangerous like fighting out there. It's like construction. Just like construction work. Construction? That doesn't sound too bad. We'll do it. Right, everyone? As long as we're spared. Yasuke Eboshiya! Come down now! If you won't come down, I'll come up. Now is your chance, Young Master. Make your father sweat a little and see how he acts. I'm sure he'll rush to where the gold is. I know he will. Yasuke, where the hell are you? Show yourself! Yasuke Eboshiya! I"m Taisaku Sasa, official spy. Tell me where the gold is. Where are you hiding it? You're... my beloved son... the apple of my eye. Are you my Sanemon? How could you? How could you kill your own father? How would I... You're just a dog. I won't tell you. Sanemon, what exactly is happening? Why are you all just standing there? There are still 128 statues left. What do we do with this? Just make a mound right here. All the demons out there will be coming here. You'll witness hell right here. Doesn't that sound like fun? Fun! I'm getting tired of this. This is making me sick. Hey, Kunai. I'll leave the rest up to you. There's the gold. There's my gold! No! That's mine. That's my gold! My gold. I won't give it to anyone else. Who are you? Are you a demon? You're the demon! Kunai! Kunai, why did you kill them? These guys were our witnesses. They won't be able to testify for us. Listen, Sasa. I'm no longer Kunai Atobe. I'm Kuzuryu now! So, you're also after the gold. Don't! How could you! Umeno told me not to kill you. Those are Kuzuryu's underlings he brought from Edo. Burn this until it's red hot. Will Umeno live? Monster. How's Umeno? She won't live. I made a bet on Umeno. If she survives, I'll stop being a spy. If she dies, I'll go back to being a two-bit samurai. But I know Umeno will die. It's time, blind bastard! Hey, Umeno is breathing! She's still alive! Don't you touch her! I don't have to touch her to feel her warmth. Umeno... You made it worthwhile for me to come back to this village. Ichi. Monster. Beast. I don't understand him. What about? That monster risks his life in exchange for nothing. Why would he do that? That's who Ichi is. He's not driven by greed. It's not in his nature. Isn't that right, Umeno? You, too? Just like you. THE END
