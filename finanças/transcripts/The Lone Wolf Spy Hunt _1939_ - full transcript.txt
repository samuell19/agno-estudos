Robbery? Murder? I see, you guys take me for a ride. - Can I have a cigarette? - Shut up! We'll return them right away. Good evening, Mr. Lanyard. I don't think I'll like you. Sorry if my men were too rude... ...but it was necessary to bring him here. - Why? There's a safe I want you to open. Did you forget the combination? - The safe is not mine. - That seems illegal to me. I'll pay ten thousand dollars for the job, Mr. Lanyard. So? That say? N�o. Are you sure you don't want to reconsider? Listen, whoever you are, I don't like your tone, ...I don't like your manners and I don't like men... ... who handed me their invitation. I think this clarifies everything. I'm sorry, Mr. Lanyard. And now what happens? Is there a good torture chamber waiting for me? - Or maybe a dark dungeon? - None of that. As long as you're not interested, you're free to leave. Levem-no. It was a pleasure. Turn on the lights. Let me guess, boss. If we can break into this safe without Lanyard's help, ...I can't understand why you made us bring you here. I have an old account pending with the Lone Wolf. He once got me into serious trouble. I still don't understand, sir. And now I'm going to do the same for him. Wouldn't you like to change your brand of cigarettes, Jenks? - Oh! - Only tomorrow. Hey, that would be great. We will proceed exactly as agreed. Plans must be withdrawn from the War Ministry at noon. You'll take care of that at lunchtime, ...before they can be copied. Exactly, what disappeared? Listen, Sergeant, one more time: the missile plans... ... Palmer's anti-aircraft was stolen, understand? - Yes. - But they didn't take all the plans. See, inventor Palmer has several of the codes in his lab. why? Because he is working to simplify the loading mechanism. - You still don't understand? - Yes I understand. The thieves only took part of the plans. That's right, sergeant. - And what were they? - It doesn't matter now. Our job is to catch these thieves before... ... that harm them. - Any leads, Inspector? A great work like this is not seen often. - Sir, but... - Now, listen, Inspector. I would like something more concrete. Well, some men can open a safe like that. - One of them is Eddie Elk. - Yea? But he's in Sing-Sing, turning 50. Oh. - There is another man. - I assume he's in Alcatraz. - Actually, he's here in Washington. - great. - And he used to smoke Regis cigarettes. - Regis cigarettes? I found this on the floor in front of the safe. Did you find them, Inspector? I had no idea the police were so efficient. Do you want me to arrest you, Inspector? Wait a moment. I just said he could have done it. In fact, he's been out of this business for a long time. He's been retired for years. But I swore that when I caught him it would be for life. I'd negotiate my pension to get him. - Who is it? - The smartest safecracker in the world. Michael Lanyard, o "Lobo Solit�rio". Fique onde est� "Scarface". - Oh, Mike. - What's up, Pat? Why doesn't Jameson die when I shoot him? This makes me very angry. Jameson, why don't you die when she shoots you? I'm very tired, sir. These violent pranks today were Ms. Patricia. She says she's finishing off the "Red Weasels". Is this for me? Oh wow! A real FBI costume! And real handcuffs! Wow! Come closer, I have something to tell you. - A detective story? - No, it's about you. It is a serious matter. Talk about the kitchen window? - Really, my cat... - No, it's not about that. I'm sending you to boarding school, Pat. Oh Mike, why? If your mother lived, I could take good care of you. I'm afraid I'm not good at being a father. You are the coolest dad in the world. No, no! Don't flatter me, young lady. Tomorrow I'm taking her to Mrs. Warren's fantastic boarding school for young ladies. Young ladies? You mean little girls. - Does Val know anything about this? - Val?... no. But when I see her, if I see her... Ali�s, Jameson, How many times did she call today? Miss Carson called at 3:15, and she didn't call until 4:00, sir. At 16:15 you tell her I'm going to take a trip to Canada. I'm afraid this is not good for you, sir. - No? - No, sir. - She's very persistent, isn't she? - Very much, sir. Mr. Lanyard, wouldn't it be easier if you married Miss Val? Easy isn't the word, Jameson. - Anyway, we couldn't. - No, sir? No, she's too young for us. - We're too old, Jameson. - Well, you're only 35 years old. If you can't marry her, sir, ...what are you going to tell him so he doesn't explode again? I don't know, why don't you think of something? I can't talk to her. I left it planted in the restaurant all of a sudden. - That explains everything, sir. - Explain what? - What she said, sir. - And what she said? Er... no, sir. I cannot repeat it, sir. - Jameson, I think I need a drink. - Yes sir. Oh, I forgot, sir, look at this. Glad you came. Mike plans something terrible for me. When I'm done with that bad father of yours, ...he won't be able to do anything to anyone. He intends to send me to boarding school. Oh, it tries to get rid of you too, doesn't it? We'll see that soon. - Are you mad at him again? - Brave? Do you want to see your father torn to pieces? I think it would be better if I stayed here, thank you. You... disgusting traitor! What have you been doing, stealing money? Jameson, what is this woman doing here? Don't interrupt me, where were you at lunchtime? - I got a call. - Two hours on the phone? Well, it was long distance. Don't be a joke. Get up, I want to talk to you. Do you realize...? Sit down! Do you realize what you did to me? - No, what? - You ran away from me. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Do you really feel? Sim. - Okay, I forgive you. - Forgive me? - Yes, I forgive you. - I knew you would understand. - Just one more thing. - What? - The bill. - Oh, I forgot about her. - Yes, I had to pay it. - Oh! I erased. Oh, one can forget these things, especially when... ...when you're so busy... How much? - How?... For lunch? - Yea. And can you still walk? I invited some friends to keep me company. great people. Yeah, don't tell me? Here's $45, including tip. 50. We had a great waiter. We have to meet for lunch sometime. By the way and just out of curiosity, where did you go this afternoon? I received a business call. Oh yes, I hope it wasn't collect. Jameson, the doorbell is ringing. Oh, Sr. Lanyard! Forget it, I'll take care of it myself. - Don't change the subject, where were you? - Excuse me. - Listen, Mike... - We've got company. - Voc� � Lanyard? - Sim. Inspector Thomas! How are you, Inspector? - great. How much time. - Yes, Miss. Carson, Inspector Thomas. E... Sargento Devon, Sr. Lanyard e Srta. Carson. - How is it going? - Pleasure. Come in, gentlemen. You're in time for a drink, Inspector. I'm afraid this is official business, Lanyard. Same? Val, get us a whiskey or something to drink. Oh no. I like the police. It's not every day that we can socialize. Look, inspector, that guy looks like he's handcuffed or something. Oh, it's Jameson. He and my daughter are playing. Just kidding, this looks very suspicious. - Miss Patricia, please. - Oh, no. Not until you promise. Lanyard! Where were you at 1 am this afternoon? - Thank you, Inspector. - Why? That's what I'm trying to find out too. - That's very suspicious. - Hands up! See, Jameson? That's how we should play. - I liked him! - He's taking her to boarding school tomorrow. Yes... for a reformatory. Val, do you want to help Jameson break free? When he's stuck, he doesn't feel comfortable. Please Miss Val. Pat, d�-me a chave, r�pido. Oh no! Not until he promises to die 3 times tomorrow. Okay, he's going to die 3 times tomorrow, right, Jameson? I promise. Well, inspector, what is this all about? - Well, a robbery has been committed. - Jewelry? No, but they broke into a safe between 1 and 2 pm this afternoon. - And why are you looking for me? - I thought maybe you could help us. Thanks. I'm afraid you'll have to come with us to the police station, Lanyard. why? A cigarette like this was found on the floor in front of the safe. - Oh, no, really, Inspector? - I know it seems placed there on purpose. But aren't these cigarettes made especially for you? For me and Carole Lombard, have you seen her? No, but we didn't like it. Now ... silver. So, would you like to know where I was between 1 and 2 am? Inspector, I have one of the most beautiful libis you've ever heard. She is... Between. Gentlemen, I thought you might be thirsty. - Yeah, it's not a bad idea. - Let's hear it, Lanyard. I don't want to interrupt, but... I pushed her away for a while. And that libi? At 1:00, Inspector, I was having lunch... ...with a young woman at the Playmouth Hotel. - Pleased? - What is this girl's name? Marie Templeton. You mean the blonde singer who's on Duke Jones August II? - Yeah. - Oh, boy, is she... Just a moment. You will leave. Miss Carson doesn't know about the other girl, huh? I'd rather go to jail, Inspector. Are you sure you had lunch with Marie Templeton? Of course, we're both interested in antiques. I have a great collection and we came later to admire it. Okay, Lanyard, let's check this out with Ms. Templeton, But remember that this story does not hold up. I know. I'll try better ones. But don't worry, I'll be quiet here. - And now, Inspector, how about a drink? - No, thanks. We have to go. Ol�, Val. What's the hurry? By the way, where does your... �libi live? No hotel Playmouth. Come back anytime, gentlemen. Maybe after we talk to this blonde. Come on, Jenks. - Funny, isn't it? - Yes, very funny. - A blonde, isn't it? Dirty traitor! - Okay, calm down. - The whole family should go to jail. -Let's just focus on Lanyard. Okay, where do we start? To the hotel in Playmouth? no. To the police station. Wait a moment. Aren't we going to see Marie? Maybe later. He's too smart to lie about her. First let's check that no one except Lanyard smokes these cigarettes. for what? Lanyard somehow got involved in this and I'm going to find out how and where. I still think we should go see Marie first. It's strange that they found one of my cigarettes. I don't care about cigarettes, what about that blonde? You invited yourself to lunch with me. - Yes, but... - I didn't have a date with you, right? - No. - Well, I had a date with the girl. She has a friend who could buy one of my antiques. Why didn't you tell me right away? I thought you wouldn't believe me. And I don't believe it. Could you take me to lunch? - It's too late. - I'll settle for dinner. - A few cocktails and a deal. - All right. - Is that a distraction? - No, I really need a drink. - I won't have to pay? - I promise. Okay, this time no blondes. Not everyone is here. Three pages disappeared. That's all there was in the vault, boss. Palmer must have the missing plans in his lab. Yes Yes! Didn't they? Are you sure? Okay, it's fine. - The police did not arrest Lanyard. - Those phony cops! No, wait a moment. Maybe it's better this way. - I wonder... - Are you glad they didn't arrest Lanyard? Yes, the Lone Wolf will lead us to the missing planes... ... from Palmer's laboratory. And this time we'll have enough evidence to hold him for life. - I am really sorry. - No way. - Love is... So wonderful. -Yea! It's fine. Her name is Marie Templeton. She is also a very intelligent woman and is interested in my antiques. If I had a knife, I'd cut your throat from ear to ear. - Sir? - Two cocktails... and a knife. I don't understand why the police suspect you. - For crime - Are you serious, Mike? The crime is serious, but I didn't do it. - Of course you can prove it. - Of course I have a witness. - Oh, that blonde. - Miss Templeton. I had to have lunch with her. What you mean? Run after all the blondes in Washington. You are blonde. It's just my hair. I'm actually a brunette. - Oh I see. - Men marry brunettes. I still prefer blondes. Mike... Voc� me ama, n�o �? - You know I do. - Do you swear? Interest. Let's get married. We will be incredibly happy. For a while perhaps, then we'd be wrong. - And you are very young. - Not so young. I'm an old man, in winter my joints ache. Also, we would have to live on a dirty farm. We could go to Bermuda in winter, or to Egypt. What do you think of Egypt? - H? No, it's too cold. - Very cold? - Very cold... - Huh? - Who is she? - Who? The woman you can't take your eyes off of. Which woman? Oh... that woman. - I don't know. - Of course not. I've never seen her in my entire life. - You lie, you liar. -Word of honor. I've never seen her before. You know I would never forget... a face. Michael, my dear, how wonderful! - You... never forget a face! - Do you want to sit down? Michael, honey, are you faking it? I thought you had forgotten about me. - Karen. - This is Miss Carson. - How is it going? - How is it going? How could you have forgotten me, dear? We had such a good time that winter in Budapest. Budapest? - Do you remember Daníbio? - Liar... Did the police question you about the theft at the Royal Palace? Theft? They knew it was the work of the Lone Wolf. Of course they didn't know what I knew. And what did you know? That Michael Lanyard and the Lone Wolf are the same person. - Do you remember? - Now I begin to remember. I'd like to talk to him about the good old days. I'm glad you say so. I was afraid you'd think I'd come to your table for another reason. - Not at all. - I need your advice... - ...if you don't have any problems. - Of course not! - Ei! - Neg�cios, Val. - Bullshit business! - Goodbye, Miss. Carson. At� but, Val. - Mike! Mike! - A conta, Srta.... You know, I'm terribly disappointed in you. - J? - It was very easy. - What? - Make you come with me. That absurd story about Budapest. - Not even a child would have believed it. -I didn't believe it. So why did you come? Is there a connection between you and the nasty people I met last night? - And if so? - I want to talk to them about cigarettes. cigarettes? Yes, they are very careful when they leave mine around. - He did that? - Shall we go and see him? - No. - So, where are we going? - To Angus Palmer's Laboratory. - For what? - To open a safe. -Oh, no! I don't like safes. Of course it will, my friend. Why, I was hoping to see you. Your friends are very nasty. Forget it smartass and do it fast. The guards will appear soon. What did he mean by guards? The men sent by Mr. Palmer have their days numbered. - Do they force you to follow orders? - Yea. Very smart. Here it is. You cannot leave. The cabinet is surrounded by an electric fence. A very smart man, Mr. Palmer. Come on, don't waste time. The locks are locked. What about? Well, I'll have to release them. The fuses. Black powder. How considerate. - Lit up. - For what? - Here, you open the safe. - It's fine. - Palmer thought of everything. - Yea. - What are you going to do? - Professional secrecy. Now everyone back. It may be dangerous. That cheap little trick? The gas expands very peculiar properties. He can't go out. Call your men. He ran away, come on! - How clumsy you are, friend. - We said you couldn't escape. Get back to work, smartass. -What happens if I can't open it? - Come on, start! - And no tricks. - Open the safe. Thanks. A cigarette. You think of everything, don't you? The cigarette... - ...my fingerprints and no libi. - Now close the safe, Mr. Lanyard. - Anything else I can do for you? - No. I think you've done enough. You can go home. Alone? No escort? No sale? Alone. He won't be smart when the police catch him. Oh Jameson, I don't like shooting you and you don't die. No, Miss Patricia, I'm too busy to die. Please, just once, just like you did yesterday. I promise not to ask you again. - Won't I have to die again tomorrow? - No, I promise. Alright, as soon as I'm done with this. - Mr. Lanyard?... Ohh! - Ohh! Who are you? Voc� � Marie Templeton, n�o �? - How do you know? - It doesn't matter. Between. - Tell me, did you have a good lunch? - Oh yeah. Splendid, that's great. Sit down. - What's that for? - Sshh! The West End Gang. Is Mr Lanyard here? - You came to see the antiques, right? - Yes, how do you know? That's what all the girls say. - Has he kissed you? - Who? Mr Lanyard? He always behaved like a perfect gentleman. Knight? H, that's what you think! Have you heard about the Sioux City Killer? - Is he the...? - Shhh! It's just one of them. Release! - Veneno. - Ooh! - It's not too late to run away. - No? - No. - How do you know so much? I've been in your power for five long years. - And why don't you escape? - I can't. His gang, they're all killers, but he's the worst. - He's such an attractive man. - That's precisely the problem. - Do you know who Mata-Hari was? - The spy? - She was his first victim. - Oh, horrible... Oh, but that was a long time ago. Yes, but then it was... Sonia, Paulette... She committed suicide. - He married all these women? -Let's see... with 8 since I've been here. - Eight? - That's just the last 5 years. - Did he divorce them? - Divorce... him? - He quartered them. - Ohh! I love that rug and I see it ruining it. - That'll give you an idea. - Al�, Marie! - Where were you? - Stealing a safe. Ohh! You bastard! - What's with her? - Are you worried about her? - What's with this provocative woman? - Just business. I don't expect to hear anything good, but I want you to tell me. Pay the bill. - I thought we only ordered one. - Well, I had to drown my sorrows. - Good evening, Senator Carson. - Goodnight. - Hello, Senator. - Hello Mike. - Hey, darling. - Hey, dear. Ol�! -Mike, I have to talk to you... as. - Sure, come in. Listen, I want to know what's going on here. Mike, don't do this, I warn you! Mike! Mike! Well, what brings you here, senator? Mike, you got me in a tight spot. Today at noon someone broke into the safe of the Ministry of War... ...and stole part of Palmer's anti-aircraft missile plans. - Part of the plans? - Yea. Fortunately, the codes are in Palmer's lab. Any idea who did this? The consensus seems to be that you did. In fact, the police believe this too. - Do you believe? - Yea. - They even took the dogs. - V�?... in what grip does this leave me? I understand! The senator's daughter has fallen in love with an international spy. Mike, this is not funny! The police are convinced it was you. Wait until they know what happened to Palmer's safe. - What happened to Palmer's safe? - I had to break into it. They forced me to do this, you know? It's all part of a sinister plan. A mysterious woman, armed men on vacation in the country? All of this is very exciting. Mike! - Hi, Val! - Let me in, will you? Alright, I'm coming down! Those mysterious gentlemen I told you about try to frame me. And will they come here for the rest of the plans? - No doubt, but you won't find them. - Why not? Because I'm going to give them to you. To me? Oh no, not that. I just want you to stay with them tonight. And what's good about it? It's my only chance for anyone to believe this fantastic story. And then I will return all plans to the War Ministry. But, if you don't have any plans. I plan to get the rest of the plans tonight. - Like? - The girl with the plans... ... Her name is Karen. That was a dirty trick. What did you expect to find in the men's room? Last time he showered with his clothes on. It should be more systematic. - Senator! - Yea? You know, there's an envelope you'll find in the inside pocket of my jacket. Oh yeah. I have to go. Are you going to Gregory's party? Mike, are we going to Gregory's party? Gregory? Who is? He's a millionaire from Baltimore. Now he is the darling of high society. Throw a fancy dress party. Parties are not for me. I have things to do. He's getting older for certain things. No, what he has to do is very important. Important to all of us. - Well... good luck. - Goodnight. What are you and my father planning? - Nothing that interests you. - Looks like I'm interested now. What happened after you left me there? - Not what you imagine. - I don't believe you. - It's true. I don't like this girl. - Same? - I have to see her again. - I knew. why? Because she has something the police think I stole. Oh, you'll have to think of a better story than that. Do you know why it looks so bad? Because it's the truth. I think that's right. You're too smart to make up that ridiculous story. You make me laugh. - Well, I'll find out. - See this? I stole it from Palmer's lab this afternoon. I'll find out where you bought it. I'm smart, aren't I? You can buy hundreds of these in Washington. That's the question. My only chance is for someone at the hotel to tell me which one. Well come out, I have to get dressed. - We got him, Mr. Gregory. - Splendid, James! What's up? What does that mean? You already have my plans, what more do you want from me? Your silence, Mr. Palmer. If he were free, it would be natural for him to duplicate the plans. But you can't keep me here indefinitely! Correct, Mr. Palmer, I cannot. You will embark on a journey, a long journey. - Where are the plans? - Here. No problem, I believe. Nothing important. Lanyard tried to escape once. It's a pity. She should go to jail. Jenks, you are an idiot. Lanyard tricked him. These are not Palmer's plans. - Do you know where Lanyard lives? - Yea. By the way, do you know what will happen to you if you come back without plans, Jenks? Sim. There's been a slight change in our plans, Mr. Palmer. Your trip will be delayed for a while. Take it down, gentlemen. Two very dry Martins. And a fence to keep the blondes out. Wait a moment. Do you know the lady who came to our table this afternoon? The one who rolled, do you know her? - Ah yes! The lady who spoke to you? - Yea. The one with the gold dress and brown fur coat? - Yes very pretty? - That's right. - Did she wear a veil? - Yes. - Who is she? I don't know. Does she come here often? Maybe two or three times, always with Gregory the millionaire. Thank you sir. Gregory, hein? And the drinks? Sorry, I don't have time. I'm very busy tonight. - What are you going to do, Mike? - I'm still not sure. - So, where are we going? - Home. Home, nothing. We could go to Gregory's party. This time I will stay close to you. I'm not going to Gregory's party. I don't have an invite. It doesn't matter. I will stay with you. To the White House. Sorry, he didn't give me any information. He said he would be back very late. Very well, sir. All right, Miss. Patricia, you... - What is this? - Don't worry. I've been here for an hour and I've seen things I haven't seen since my last hangover. I completely forgot. It's a surrealist party. Surreal, huh? I can define it with better words than that. I will wait for you here. Mr Fenton. - Ol�. - Ol�! - Excuse me, can you read this? - Yea. Let's see, is this the number 6666 here? - Yes. - Oh, and what's your fantasy? I'm dressed as a virgin forest. And you? Look! Midnight... here we go! What's the problem? Missed something? Hey... wait a minute, buddy. How are you with my hat? Your invitation, sir. Dr. Roger Beachams. Sr. Charles Fenton. - Wait a minute, Charlie Fenton? - Yea. - Are you sure? - Yea. What a curious thing. - Charlie Fenton from the October Club? - Yea. - Are you really sure? - Yea. OH...This is very strange. I thought I was Charlie Fenton from the October Club. There may be two Charlie Fentons in the October Club. This is impossible. I should know if I live with myself. Oh. Wait a moment. I have to clarify this. Voc� � Charlie Fenton... Eu n�o sou Charlie Fenton. - Who I am? - I don't know. Well I have to be somebody! Or not? Why don't you ask the policeman? Oh, it's a great idea. And I not knowing. They always take me home. Well, officially! The top is closed. The party is over there. Thanks. Oh wow! Don't worry. Everyone is losing their minds tonight. - I go whiskey to stay in tune. - I serve you. You know, this is what I like most about my profession. I never felt like drinking on the job. - With soda? - Yes thanks. - Here it is, sir. Thanks. - I'll be right back. - Why? - I... I think you dropped that. - It's you! - Aren't you surprised to see me here? - No. - Not even after this afternoon? - I had to see you. - I haven't been impressed like this in years. - So you liked me, didn't you? - Very. - More than that other girl? Val Carson? I like you differently. - You're a fool, aren't you? - Yea. - Too silly? - Very. - Now who's the fool? - Ha, ha. - What does �ha, ha� mean? - Well... ha, ha. I knew it was you all along. I knew nothing. You are a perfect liar. I thought you said you didn't like her. - Well... I don't like... - Oh, no. "It's very nice." '"I like you differently." - What I said was a lie. - You said I was a fool. - And you are. - I guess so. I'm starting to believe you again. - Are you sure you like me? - With all my heart. - I did want to lift it up or walk on top. - Or what? Gregory is here somewhere. - Why don't you follow him? - There is a guard on the stairs. - You can help me. - What do I do? - Go to the dance floor and scream. - Shout out? Yes. Scream as loud as you can. We will. - What's the problem? - Problem? - You screamed. - Oh, it was nothing. � or anti-theft alarm. - Probably a short circuit. - I'm not so sure. - What's up? - Something with the anti-theft alarm. - Gregory said to stay close. - It's fine. Do you see anything interesting in this painting, Mr. Lanyard? Well if not my old friend. I hope I didn't interrupt your investigation in my office. In fact, you interrupted. Well...until another day...maybe. - Yea? - Got them, boss. It's in my pocket. Yes. Lanyard gave them to Senator Carson for safekeeping. Splendid, James! Now come back here immediately. Gregory, your friends are starting to seriously piss me off. - We won't irritate you much longer. - I'm afraid you're right, Mr. Lanyard. -You will leave the country by air. - Let's help you breathe well. - You are making a big mistake. - Why? Because I have half the plans. If you kill me, you'll never have them. This is not a problem that should concern you, Mr. Lanyard. Take him out the back exit, boys. - Hello, "Midnight". - Hello! - That's the man! - The gentleman says you are an imposter. - Yea? - Answer a question. - Why not? proceed. Okay, okay. I'm just going to ask you one question. No one except Charlie Fenton knows the answer. - Are you ready? - Yea. Well... -... I forgot. No, wait, here you go. Let's see, your wife's name is Pearl? - Yea! - Ok, I give up. - Sorry to bother you. - It was nothing. - You have to take him to a taxi. - All right, Mr. Fenton. Now I know I have to "pull the car". Good night, boys. - Who are you, miss? - My name is Val Carson. - Know anyone here? - Now I don't see anyone. Oh, that's the man I came with. He will identify me. Yuhuu, Mike! Yuhuu! Ol�! - Mike. - Do you know this woman? - I've never seen her in my life. - What? Don't worry, miss. Nobody seems to remember anybody. - Who did this to you? - Some very bad people, sir. - They seemed to be looking for something. - And they didn't find it? No, sir, and they looked very angry too. They wanted to know who had come here tonight. - Did you tell them? - Yes sir. I said that Miss Val and her father were the only ones who had come here. With Senator Carson, Miss... what? Same? I will go immediately. - They were stolen again. - Who, sir? - My half of the plans. - I don't understand, sir. Let's play with these people, Jameson. It's called: "Treasure, treasure, who has the treasure?" Sounds like a pretty tough game, sir. Yes, that's right. - Won't you talk? Okay, tough guy. - We will! Got to the end of the line. I will break your crest. Try it. Gerry, give him his due. Watch out, behind you! Next week: "The Red Weasels Attack. I'm sorry, Mike. I used to listen to "The Red Weasels" with Mom. For now I forgive you, young lady. Grab some clothes, let's go places. Oh? Oh my! Let's get it out of here in case of unexpected visitors. - The police, sir? - Police? - They called, sir. - When? - As soon as he left. - What did they want? You, sir. By the way, what happened to Ms. Carlson? I left it at the party, in a hurry, I'm afraid. - Why sir? - I had to leave her, Jameson. I ran into a problem that I didn't want her involved in. You already know that she... well... that means a lot to me. - "Precious" is the word. - I'm afraid so. Sometimes I wish I weren't so old, I could be her father. - Yes. - If you're in a hurry, leave a little early. Oh, hope! - Pour me a whiskey and soda. - Yes sir. D�-me. No, hold on tight. Now hold it while I drink. - Are you okay, sir? - Quite well. You can leave it there. Oh, leave all your fingerprints. - Now, answer the bell. - If no one touched. I want to talk with... What is all this? Just a routine robbery, inspector, nothing important. - Ah yes? - I'll arrest you for theft, Lanyard. Who did I steal this time? The Treasury Minister? - No, he broke into Palmer's safe. - The inventor? Do you think I'm kidding? We found fingerprints on it. And they think they're mine. Need to be. We found another one of your cigarettes in front of the safe. Waste your time, Inspector. You know I didn't do that job at the War Ministry. - How we know? - Didn't you talk to Marie Templeton? - Yeah, we talked to her. - And then? She never heard of you. This is one of the happiest moments of my life, Lanyard. - One moment, Inspector. - Miss Carson! Lanyard couldn't be in the War Ministry. - Why not? - Do I tell them, honey? Of course...go on... Don't mind, Miss. Carson, after all... - Sra., Inspector, Sra. Lanyard. - Sra. Lanyard? - Sra. Lanyard! - Sra. Lanyard! Yes, we got married at 1:00 pm this afternoon. Just as the safe was stolen, Inspector. I think this is the worst case I've worked on. Won't you congratulate us? - Sure. Congratulations, Ms. Lanyard. - Thanks. Felici... Doesn't look very happy to me. - I am really happy. - Should be. Now all you have to do is explain your fingerprints on Palmer's safe. - You still don't know if it's my fingerprints. - We'll find out soon enough. You can't collect my fingerprints if I'm not arrested. I know my rights. Ok, so let's have it turned on. - On my wedding night? Oh! - You wouldn't do that, Inspector. Jameson, get me a cold drink. Don't touch that cup! Take this, Devon. Do you think we're idiots? It looks like his name is written all over Palmer's chest. - Here you are, Devon. Check the fingerprints. - Just a moment. - Checked. We are not of the same subject. - Like? Anyway, he will come with us. It feels good to arrest a man for a crime, ...even if your fingerprints don't match. This is the worst case I've worked on. Well, looks like you've saved yourself again, Lanyard. You're somehow involved in this case, and I'm going to find out how. You can bet on it. I will check if your license has expired. - If you weren't married... - Inspector! Good night, inspector. Good night, sergeant. What's good about her? In my 15 years in the police... - Are you really a police officer? - Yea. - Really? - Yes, really. - That's thinking fast. - It wasn't like that, dear. - Sorry I left you at the party. - All right. - Aren't you angry? - No, I understand. I fear that if I had gone with you it would have been worse. You're right. - Mike, honey. - What? I didn't know I was so precious to you. So you heard me talking to Jameson, right? You are not old enough to be my father. Listening behind doors. Another vice that will have to be corrected, ...beyond drunkenness. - Mike. - What? - This is serious. - Of course yes. I almost ended up married. No, silly. I did this to save your neck. You were in trouble. You don't even know half of them, which reminds me that... - ...we have to get out of here. - Why? I expect very unpleasant people. - What is all this, Mike? - I'll tell you later. I'll take you and Pat to your house, where you'll be safe. I don't want to be safe, I just want to be with you. I'll let Pat. Mr Lanyard! Look. We have to get out of here. All down. There's a car there. It's what I was looking for. - Did you see that, sergeant? - Drink your coffee. - That guy again, sergeant! - Shut up! This starts to irritate me. Damn cops, are you sleeping or what? Next time throw this out the window to see if they wake up. It will be a pleasure. Wow, I'm getting dizzy! Let's go! Hit the target! - Was it that guy again? - Now he irritated you enough? Silence! Let's go! - Good luck, he escaped! - Shut up! Here he comes, sergeant! What do you think we should do now, Sergeant? Get on the road! It worked better than I expected. - It was fun, wasn't it? - Very fun. - Mike, let's do it again? - Go to bed. Ah, Mike. - Where do you come from? - What happened to you? Who made this? That? The same guy who took the plans. That guy in the gray hat? I think so. He looked republican. I know him. All the more reason to go after him. We played police and bandit. It was very funny! It's time for you to lie down. Very good. Now Patricia come up, yes sir. The "Red Weasels" come after us. Come on, little pest. Sorry, Senator, I didn't mean to get you involved in this mess. forget it. I haven't had this much fun since I was in administration. - It's not for that, daddy. - But what's up? - More trouble? - Well, you could say yes. Mike breaks into safes, Jameson gets hit in the head and... ...told the police that Mike and I got married. - Married? with you? - Not yet. We just hit a police car. What it does is improve your criminal history. - Pat! - Ol�! Get out of there. I thought I told you to go to bed. Well, where are we going now? You're not going anywhere, but I'll get the rest of the plans. - I'm going too. - No, you won't. You are very tired. Need to rest. I'll go with you, Mike. Mike! Those men are here again. what? - Now go to bed. - Oh, hell! - I'll miss all the fun. - C'mon C'mon. Let them in. It's Karen and the man who hit you, Joe. I will too. Mike, let me deal with this provocative woman, will you? Oh, n�o. If you try any of your tricks, I'll slit their throats. Yes sir. Please enter. I'll tell Mr. Lanyard you're here, sir. - No way. - Jameson, why did you do that? An eye for an eye, sir. - I'm already quite satisfied, sir. - Oh. - The people have arrived, sir. - Tell them to come in. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. I want to speak with Mr. Lanyard as well. I hope you know what you're doing. - I said as. - Yes, I heard her. All right, I'm leaving. Don't you want to sit down? - Cigarettes? - No, not like that, thank you. Mr. Lanyard, this game of hide and seek was a lot of fun. - But it must end. - I am really sorry. - I was starting to like it. - Conditions have changed. Same? We have to deliver Palmer's plans by dawn or we'll lose the sale. And what does this have to do with me? We want to make a deal with you. I know, but this time no gimmicks. Let's join our forces and share the benefits. - I'm afraid I can't. - Why not? For starters, because I couldn't get my hands on my part of the plans... ...so quickly. Also, I don't like your friend Gregory. You know... I was disappointed too. Are you sure you don't want to reconsider? - Well... I'm sure. - Do you have to go so early? Voc�! Voc�, Casanova! - Excuse me. - Yea? You were right, Jameson. Very satisfying. Very much, sir. - Fortunately I arrived in time. - Mr Lanyard! Mr. Lanyard, Ms. Patricia is gone! - What? - Look! Mike: I'm going to accompany this gang you... ...wanted to find, know when I discover your hiding place. Pat (G-7) Mike! Give me 15 minutes and call Inspector Thomas. Tell him to look for Pat and me at Gregory's. Wait a minute. - Hey! Who are you? - I'm the G-7. - A detective. - Hello! - Hello! - Lets go in. I checked the marriage license office. There are no marriage licenses with those names this year. Are you sure? Of course yes. This guy is the office director and can confirm. - Is it true? - Yes sir. It's true. �timo. Send a general alarm to Michael Lanyard, -... age, 35 years old. - Dark hair and mustache. He wears a tuxedo and has been seen in the company of a blonde woman. Drives a yellow sports car. Arrest him when you see him. It's coming. Hi, smart guy. Inspector, you have to come with me. All the police in Washington are looking for Lanyard. It doesn't make sense that you can take me to him. But I can. He's at Gregory's, Madison, 17. Gregory is the man you are looking for. Michael told me to tell you. That's your answer. And he told you to tell me. I'm not going anywhere that Lanyard says he is because it's... ...of course it's somewhere else, I know that. Ma'am, you can't think the inspector is a fool. All right, I'll go alone. Someone will help me. This woman makes me dizzy! Yes, we already have all the plans. I think you already know what will happen to you. - I can imagine. - If there's something you want... ...let's say... Your last order. I came here to see my little girl. It is reasonable. Jenks, bring Mr. Lanyard's daughter. - Ol�, Valdy. - Ol�! You'd better accompany me silently. Will be happy to know we have another guest. - Yea? - Miss. Carson decided to join them. Let her go. She has nothing to do with it. She will be fine. You don't have to worry about her. This just arrived, Inspector. Hey, Devon. They found Lanyard's car at 17 Madison. All this is very strange. We were sitting here while Ms. Carson told us where he was. We will! I'm sorry, Mike. I guess I'm not a good detective. Come here, Pat. Pat, I... I want to talk to you. All right, Pat. Calm. cry. Now. I'll have to take a long trip, Pat. Be nice. There are some papers in the left desk drawer. I'll create a distraction, grab them and run. Gotta be a good girl, Pat. Remember what I told you. I will, daddy. Don't worry about me. I'll be fine. Gregory, promise Pat will be okay, will you? I owed you that one! Mike! Mike! Here inside! - OK! - Oh, Mike, good to see you! This is Mr. Palmer. He... There is no time. Let's get out of here. Don't worry, honey. We'd better get out of here as soon as possible. E Lanyard? Plans are most important right now. Step aside. Leave it to me! Try to get in, boys. Sounds like the marines. A pol�cia! - Well if not my old friend Lanyard. - Inspector, just in time! I would say yes. If you get out of this, Lanyard... I'll eat my hat! - Shall I bring you your hat, Inspector? - Bring me two. Won't you need me anymore tonight, Inspector? Who are you? is the subject of the marriage license office. - I never needed you! - Excuse me. Would you like to issue a marriage license? Yes, certainly. Of course yes! He's just the man I'm looking for. We're going to need you. Come on, darling. - Inspector, arrest me without bail. - For what? I don't know, but I think I'll have something to confess to tomorrow morning. - Take him, Devon. - It's fine. Val, don't worry. I have the keys. karamazov: Subtitles & Sync Base Legendas: anubis40 [blackstyle]
