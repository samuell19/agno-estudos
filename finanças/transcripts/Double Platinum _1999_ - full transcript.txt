Olivia, get on out here. I can't. Martin Holly was in the audience. He wants to talk to you. Who is Martin Holly? From New York. Martin Holly who owns Holly's. Jeez, girl, you are green. Come on, now. Don't look at me. I've never been out of Atlanta. No, I can't. She's too tired. Here. Give. I'll take her home. Adam's there, isn't he? Yes, but I don't know that I should do this. Olivia, it's three blocks. Go on out there and see what this Mr. Holly wants. Okay. Kayla, baby, you'll be okay? Kayla? Would you put her coat on? Keep her warm. It's cold outside. Okay. Give Mama a kiss. Go. Okay. MARTIN: I can't pay much, but that's not how it works. The right people know I deliver. And that's why they come to my place. It's not about money. I have family here. I have a little baby girl. My husband's just started a new business. And I just really can't leave Atlanta right now. Look, I'm not talking about some quick bucks and a phony contract. You're an artist. You've got a gift. Hey. You're all right, girl. You gonna pretend you don't? You know, maybe down the line. Maybe another time. I can't get away right now. I saw 10 acts since I got here. You're the one I want, but I'm going back tomorrow. I'll be at the hotel till noon. You know the Excelsior? Yeah. Then tell me you'll think about it. Don't throw away a chance like this, kid. Life's too short. Especially somebody who's got a voice like yours. How's Kayla? She's in bed. Helen brought her home. How you doing, Olivia? Oh, your lady looking good. Come on, deal! Shut up and deal, you fool. All right, here we go. Here we go. All right, all right. You have a nice time? It was great. The place was packed. You wouldn't believe it. What? No, no, no. Baby, could you get me another beer? Oh! Boom! Boom! Look at that! Look at that! Look at that! Oh, yeah. That's big. One more time. You want another one? Yeah, another one. Put your chips in, gentlemen, huh? Boom! Look at that! She's asleep. Yeah, I know. Don't worry about that mess. You can clean it up in the morning. Just as well clean it up now. Let's go to bed. Joe is right. You are looking very good. Adam? Hmm? I got an offer to go to New York tonight. Well, I hope you let him down easy. No, actually, I didn't. I didn't. But you will. I don't know. You know, maybe if your mother helped out with Kayla, if somebody could sub at the cleaners, I can get a chance to go. It's not even about making money. This is a really famous place. There's a lot of famous people that come from there. Olivia, why are we even talking about this? 'Cause I'm a singer, that's what I want to do. You know that. You sing at church. You got your little show every couple of weeks. Isn't that enough for you? My little show. You see, look, this is a very, very important man. His name is Martin Holly. He's discovered a lot of important talent. He thinks that I could be a great artist. This is a great opportunity for me. For what? Hmm? To wander from juke joint to juke joint? I've been down that road, Olivia. It is a road to nowhere. What about Kayla? I could take her with me. Oh, no, no, no, no. No, you are not taking her anywhere. Why is it every time we try to talk about this, you get mad? I don't want to talk about this anymore. Olivia, you are not going. Somebody says something you want to hear, and you forget who you are. Adam, I-- I mean it! Sweet baby. Hey, baby. It's okay. It's okay, baby. Tell me what to do. When did you get to be so perfect? You're just so precious. Sweet baby. Mommy's got to go. I can't stay here anymore. I gotta go. I'm going just for a little while, and I'm coming back. You won't even miss me. I'm coming back. But I gotta go. It's okay. It's okay. Maybe one day you'll know you should go for your dreams. I love you. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Baby Kayla. Sweet baby. ♪ Oh, oh, I need you, babe ♪ Work it, child!

I'm glad you're here. That was a different guy. I think they're taking turns waiting on you. Wow, everybody's staring at you. Does that kind of bother you a little bit? No, not really. People are basically nice to me. It's only hard when you're tired. Did you always know you'd make it? No, not really. I think once I made up my mind, you know, there was just no turning back. Hmm. Well, I sing too. Really? I do. I do. I don't call myself an artist or anything, not like you, but singing is all I've ever wanted to do in the world. It's such a dream for me. Do you ever get the feeling when you sing, the feeling like it's not even you? I mean, you can hear yourself, but in your mind you're just not sure, you know? Like the music just comes up, comes out of your voice, like it's using it and taking over? Sometimes you feel like you're just flying. It's just like it means everything to you. Even when you were my age, did you know you had to sing? When I was growing up in Georgia, they couldn't shut me up. Oh, hey, I was born in Georgia. I know. How'd you know? I mean, you know, I can kind of tell from that little Southern sound in your voice. Yeah. So tell me, what does your family feel about your wanting to be a singer? Oh, my dad's not that encouraging about it. No mom around for him to argue with, you know. Yeah. She left. Left when I was a baby. Oh, sweetie. Used to bother me a lot, but I'm over it now. I figure, it's her loss. Any woman who could leave me, doesn't deserve to have me. Well, your dad has certainly done a good job. Look how you've turned out. Lucky, that's for sure. I'm doing okay, though, right? You're beautiful. Thank you. I just wanted to tell you, Miss King, that this is the luckiest night of my life. I'm having a great time. Thank you so much. It's the luckiest night of my life. So tell me, when am I gonna get to hear you sing? I'm doing a late show tomorrow night at one of the clubs right near here. I'm there. Serious? Yes. Hey, Daddy. Hey! Well, don't you look great. Thank you, Daddy. Oh, my God. I had the best night of my life. Good, good. Who was your big mystery date? Olivia King. I had tickets to her concert, and then she took me to dinner, just the two of us, Dad. She's so pretty. Olivia King, Daddy. You don't know who she is? Oh, yeah, I know who she is. You gotta be living under a rock not to know who Olivia King is. So, what did she talk to you about? Everything. Daddy, what's wrong? Are you okay? Oh, baby, I'm just tired. That's all. Look how late it is. You gotta open up the store in the morning. I know, but don't you want to hear more about my story? No, I don't. Not tonight. Kay... I'm glad you had such a nice time. Thanks. MAN: One hour till curtain, Miss King. OLIVIA: Thank you, Pete. ADAM: Olivia. Hi, can I help you? What the hell do you think you're doing? Do you want me to call security? Peggy, it's okay. It's okay. You stay away from Kayla. Why, Adam? I'm her mother. I need to see her. It's always about you, isn't it? It's not about me! It is always about you! Now, you think you're gonna come in here for three days and make your big love pronouncement and then walk out? You can stop punishing me now. It's what you did before to both of us! I will not let you hurt her again! You stay away. No sign of her yet. You ready? Please, can we just wait five more minutes? For Olivia King? I don't think so.

Okay. This is real difficult for me. Well... What's wrong? I have something really important to tell you. I don't know how to say this. I mean... Kayla... Kayla, sweetheart... It's okay, Olivia. I'm your mother. Please don't be mad at me. Give me a chance to explain. Kayla. Kayla, baby, give me a chance to explain! ADAM: Kay? Yeah, it's me. How did it go? It went fine. I need to talk to you. I don't want to talk to you. I don't know what your daddy said to you. You know what? I'm not even talking to my dad. All right? I've had all night to think about this situation. And ever since I was a little kid, I've read articles about you, and never once did you mention you had a child! Was I supposed to do, baby, call up and say, "I'm Olivia King. I'm your mother"? Why not? Why wouldn't you do that? That might have been the first honest thing you ever did in your life. I just wanted to see you, you know, and to hear your voice. Why? Was there a hole in your schedule? Was there a blank page in the calendar where you penciled in "motherhood"? I've always tried to be with you. You know, your dad has always threatened me that I could never come back and be with you. He wouldn't let me be with you. Olivia, please, all right? "Trying" is a lame excuse. I have to go. I have to open the store. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Baby, look. Let me just show you something, sweetheart. It's a picture of you and me. I love you. I've always loved you. By the time it was developed, you were over it. No, sweetheart. Let me do something. Let me try. Let me help you a little bit. Can I--? Let me be involved in your life a little. I mean, maybe I could help you with your career. Because I'm good or is it because you feel guilty? Because you're good and I feel guilty. You could work in clubs here in St. Louis forever. Come to New York. Let me help you. I'll stop everything I'm doing and I'll introduce you to the right people. I can help you. Let me help you with your career. Do you know how many times I played out this scene in my head? So have I, baby. Well, how did yours turn out? All hugs, kisses? My heart is broken. You don't understand. I've always missed you. It's been very painful for me too. "Painful"? You don't have any idea. Oh, my God. Oh, Kayla. Come here. She said she wanted to help me with my career. She's probably lying about that too. Why shouldn't she? Not in a million years. Kayla, she could do it. I just don't want to owe her anything. Not anything. No, no, no, no. It's just the opposite. You see, she owes you. She owes you big-time, girl. Ladies, can you give me a hand up here, please? Think about it, okay? Kay, please stop daydreaming. I need you at the register. Hey. No wonder you didn't want me to sing. How could you lie to me? How could you fake all this time? Were you ever gonna tell me? Yes, I was. When? Baby, I was doing what I thought was right. That's phony, Daddy. Would you like to hear my side of the story? Not really. You know what? You guys are really a pair. You and my mother. Both of you did what was best for you. She takes off, she wants back in and you don't let her. I couldn't do that, Kay. She would have been in your life for a day... Or a week. And then she would have been gone again. She would have been touring or recording an album. And, uh... I didn't want you hurt. You sure? Are you sure you were not worried that if I had the choice... I wouldn't choose you? Look, Marc... No, look, I don't... I don't want Ric Ortega, okay? Okay? There's got to be a whole bunch of other A&R people out there that understand my music. Look, okay. You can get somebody else, I'm sure. He has a completely different agenda, and I... I don't like him, okay? I don't like him, and I don't want to argue with you! Just do it! I'm not gonna change my mind! Just... Just... Okay, okay, okay, okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm getting ready to go on stage now. You know, I'm going on... Okay. All right. Just make it happen, okay? Thank you very much. Just... Okay, relax. Oh, my God. I can't do this. It can't happen tonight. All right, all right, okay. All right, all right, okay. Relax. Everybody's here for you. It will be okay. You'll be fine. See? It's okay. She didn't call the hotel. You should have given her the cell phone number, okay? Five minutes, Miss King. I'm sorry, Peggy. I'm just... Stop it. Okay. Come on, let's get ready.

Does it work for you, my terms? Yes. Good. Then I'll see you tomorrow. So where do we live? Right up there. KAYLA: Oh, wow. People live here? Over there, look, look. Empire State Building. Look straight through there, the Statue of Liberty. Oh. And over here, right down there, Rockefeller Center. Oh. Rose? Rose, we're here. I wasn't expecting you this fast. Oh. There must not have been any traffic at all on the bridge. It's good to see you. Mr. Reckler and Gary are on their way over. That's the man that runs the record company. That's Marc. And Gary is my agent. What did Peggy do, send smoke signals from the airport? Probably. I'll get that. Okay. Come on. I'll show you your bedroom. Okay. I'll bet you'd like something to eat. We just got off the plane. Exactly. What's up with you? First you don't want Ric for the album. Okay, I can live with that. But then you call Gary and you want to reschedule everything? I told him, 12 years you have never asked for anything. This once, she can be a diva! Ah, ah, Ric Ortega is your fault, Marc. Olivia never approved him. Shut up, Gary. I need this time. And she deserves it. She's been doing six sold-out performances a week. And the reviews from St. Louis, magnificent. You won't be sorry, Marc. You won't be sorry. I have something special for you, and the album won't be late. Look how he doesn't believe her. This is what we're telling you. Okay, where's this "something special"? Kayla? Coming. Gentlemen, this is the "something special." Kayla Harris. 4th Avenue Records' next double platinum artist. So who is she? I told you. I saw her in St. Louis, you know, and she blew me away. And she reminds me of me when I was younger. I need to help her. I want to. Look, indulge me, Marc. Okay? I want to do this. As long as you keep your album date. I will. I will. I promise. I told you that. She is adorable. Kayla? Kayla. I couldn't sleep. What is it, Kay? Don't call me "Kay." My dad calls me that. I love this view. It's too bad they sell it by the inch. Is this the part where you tell me, "Someday this will all be yours"? It could happen. Gary said he's willing to take you on. As a manager? OLIVIA: Yep. If the demo that we do is as good as we promised. It will be. You know what? Material is the key. You can be the greatest singer in the world, but if you don't have the right song, it can't happen. Do you write? Not like you. Like I did. I haven't written any songs in a long time. Why? I guess I've run out of things to say. Oh. You know what? I have a good idea. A songwriter pitched a song to me for my album. I think if we change it around a bit, it would be perfect for you. Ooh, are you warm enough, sweetheart? I'm okay.

MAN: Ric Ortega, Miss King is on the way up. Oh, look how excited I am. What do you think about my singing at the 4th Avenue Records Grammy party? Oh, come on. Every year they ask, and every year you say no. Yeah, but I think it would be a nice gesture, don't you? You know what? You do not need to do gestures. You need to get back to work. I need their support on the next album. Oh, I don't know. I just think it's more trouble than it's worth. I mean, you gotta prepare. That means more time off from the album. And then you could strain your voice. You worry too much. That's what you pay me for. I pay you? Cookie, wait till you get that bill. What is this? This is the start of some serious image building. I'm looking for something a little more "girl next door," a little sweeter, you know, nicer. Olivia, I like it. OLIVIA: Kayla, you don't know what you like. Would you trust me? Leave this to me, okay? Miss King, no offense, but I'm not holding it against you that you got me kicked off your album, but this is my shoot and my album. Excuse me? Just a moment, okay? Look, I could kick you off of this one too. Look, I'm doing my job! Olivia! Kayla, could you just let me handle this, please? What do you want her to do? Strip now before the song or after? The label is trying to create a star and make money, just like they did with you. They did not create me, okay? I'm a lady, and you have to earn respect in this business. Well, things are a little more hormonal these days. We're going to the same place, just a lot faster. Why are you in such a hurry? You know, she's a great talent. She's got a great voice. Yes, I know that, and pretty soon everybody else will know it too. Look, front page, Billboard. Not bad, huh? And after she sings at the Grammy party, everybody in the industry will hear about her. Boom! She's on her way. She's outta here! Bye, Kayla! Bye! I can't believe you did that. Let me just handle this, sweetheart. Just trust me, okay? So were you gonna tell me that she was singing at the Grammy party? Of course I was gonna tell you. Olivia, you... Let's see if we can work out a little smile there, okay? Everything's gonna be fine. That's it. Work it a little more. Yes, that looks good, Kayla. Back and forth, yes. That was hard work. Those lights, them heels. You did your thing. Yeah, I loved it. It was so much fun. Yeah. You did well. Yeah. You could tell by John Claude's face. Thank you. But I don't think Olivia thought so. What's the deal with you two anyway? She's helping me. All in your face like that? You don't need that kind of help. Well, she's being really generous. That's what worries me. She wants to take the credit for anything you do. She'll be the hero. What you staying with her for anyway? Well, she... She told my dad that she'd keep an eye on me. You know, I don't know anybody in New York. Otherwise, he probably wouldn't have let me come out here. Ah. You say the word, I'll talk to your dad, I'll go to 4th Avenue, get you an advance, get you your own crib. You don't need Olivia King. You're gonna meet enough people soon enough anyway. Now, let's get the baby bird to her bird's nest. Okay, I'm feeling that. Where were you? Why didn't you call? Please don't play mom. It's a little late for that. Well, I was worried. You could have gotten in an accident. I didn't know whether I should call the police. I didn't know what I was supposed to do. Olivia, I can take care of myself. All right? Okay. I know you can. Yeah? Then why don't you tell me about that scene that you caused today. Huh? Why did you make a fool out of me in front of all those people? I'm sorry. That was not my intention. Everything I do is for you. I felt like a little kid with you fighting all over me, like I don't have any ideas of my own. Look, all I'm doing is reacting to what you said to me in St. Louis. I know what this means to you. I know what you want. What you think I want. I'll tell you what I don't want. I don't want you to tell me how to dress, I don't want you to tell me what pictures to take, and I don't want you to tell me what kind of video to make. All right? It's none of your business. Have you started planning your video? Yes. Well, I need to talk to Marc because I have the concept. They already have a concept. Ric's, right? Mm-hm. The label likes it. All right? And don't start on him, because you don't even know him. I've known a lot of Rics. You don't know him. Yeah? About a week less than I've known you. Look, I'm sorry, Olivia. I don't mean to seem ungrateful. But I have to trust the record company. I think they know what they're doing. And Ric should be in charge. Hello? Hello, Gary? Oh, hi. Yeah, I'm sorry. It's okay. Look, I'm ready to go back to work on my album. Really? You want to get in the studio? Make it happen. I'll take care of it, babe.

I'm hoping for two or three singles on the Billboard Hot 100 before the year is out. I think she's more than just a singles artist though, Marc, you know? Have you ever stopped to talk to her? Oh, just talk to her about how she feels about her music. Why are you so invested in this girl? I'm not "so invested." I knew this the minute you got back from St. Louis. What is it you aren't telling me? Who the hell is this Kayla Harris to you? She's my daughter, Marc. She's my baby. No, no, that's not funny, Olivia. I know it's not funny. It's the truth. My God. All this time, you didn't tell me. All this time. I couldn't tell anybody. You don't get any prizes for abandoning your baby. And I keep trying to talk to her, and she just won't let me in. She won't. I love her so much, Marc. Well, did you tell her that? I'm afraid she'll just run away. Well, how do you know that? I've tried everything. It just won't work out. It's not working. Well, make it work, Olivia. Take it from someone who loves you back. Ah. You deserve this. Go home. Go home and talk to your daughter. Hi. So, what did I do now? You know what? You need to stop taking everything so personally. So you're packing and leaving because... Because I'd like a place of my own. All right? I can afford it. It was gonna be over soon anyway. I'm going on tour after the Grammy party, and I'd like to be settled before. Why are you going on tour? You don't have a band. You have not done any rehearsals. You know, there's a million things you need to be doing before you go out on tour. Because my single is number two, and it's going up. All right? I have an album ready, and I'd like to go on tour so I can promote it, so people can buy it. Even the great Olivia King does that. You need to stop talking to me like this. I don't know how else to talk to you. You know, I thought that... I thought that somehow I could... Okay, this is your call. All right? Why do you want me here anyway? Why do you want me here? Is there anything in this situation that's making you happy? What are you getting out of this? That should be obvious. I love seeing you. I love having you here. I love waking up and knowing where you are, that you're okay. Because I love you. Then I'm sorry for you. I'm really sorry. 'Cause this time, it's your loss. Could you please, please let me know where you are? We'll get strong, and we'll get muscles. You are crazy. You know what? You're so cute when you're mad. I love it. Oh, thanks. KAYLA: Whew! Okay. Gently now. Oh, my God, Ric, look at my table! Well, let's drink a toast to your new table and your new apartment and your new career. I don't have any glasses, baby. I'll get some. No, I want to get my own glasses. But you can do the food thing. Order me some Chinese food just like they do in the movies, okay? See if you can find a phone book in the kitchen. Be back. What? This is not gonna make your day. PEGGY: The good news is that they got it right. The bad news is they got it all. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Hey, beauty. Tell me you had nothing to do with that. Tell me! I swear to God. How could you even think I had something to do with this? Do you know who I think it was? That Ric Ortega! Oh, come on. Ric likes Kayla. He would never do this. It couldn't be Peggy, and Gary didn't know anything about this. What about Kayla? Maybe she's had second thoughts. Not in a million years. She'd be devastated. So, what do you want me to do? Get rid of Ric Ortega, okay? I feel stupid. I can't believe that I didn't realize what the connection was. Kayla's voice, Olivia's. I think I'm gonna throw up. It never occurred to you? You... You never speculated? You... You never talked to anyone about it? Come on, no. Everybody's gonna know about me. Now listen, Kayla. This whole thing is gonna last five minutes. It stinks, I know, but it happened. There's nothing we can do about that. It doesn't really matter how they heard about you, all that matters is that they hear your voice. You did it. You did it. I know you did. You're a snake. I don't know how you found out, but you did it. Look, back off, Olivia. I care about Kayla. Are you believing this garbage? Look, Olivia, Ric didn't have anything to do with it. I hope you know who to trust, okay? I'm out of here. REPORTER 1: Where is the father? REPORTER 2: How much did you pay him to stay silent? REPORTER 3: Miss King, how's Kayla? Does your daughter hate you now? Hello. Hey, Kay. Daddy? Yeah, it's me. You doing all right? No, but I'll get better. I saw that paper, Kay. I'm real sorry, sweetheart. No, it's not your fault. Well, I don't know about that. All I know is I... I... I didn't protect you like I should have. Keeping it secret from you and all like I did... Uh, left you kind of defenseless. I know you didn't mean to. Hey, I heard your record. You did? Yeah, yeah. I meant to call you about it, but, uh... It's real fine, Kay. Thank you, Daddy. Thank you. And I kind of miss you. Oh, I miss you too. Hey, maybe you could come to New York. Oh, I don't think this cat's ready for that particular jungle. Okay. Come in. It's me. Hi, sweetie. Hey. I just came to wish you luck. Tonight's your night, and you're gonna be fabulous. Thank you. I am so nervous. All those famous people out there. Why me? Oh, you're fabulous, that's why. It's not about me, it's not about Ric. It's about you. You're the one who lights up the room, okay? Thank you. Remember everything. Just enjoy yourself. Have a good time. Okay. Thank you. I know they asked you to sing too. I know, but tonight the attention should be on you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Recording artists 702, ladies and gentlemen.

I didn't plan that they were gonna call me on the stage. Look, I trusted you, Olivia, and you lied to me again! I mean, couldn't somebody else be in the spotlight even this once? This was my night! Kayla, baby! Kayla! Just leave me alone! Stop it! Stop! I need to talk to you! Just stay away from me! How long are you gonna stay at the cabin? I don't know. Until some rabid raccoon comes and chews through the telephone wires. Can I give out your phone number? No. Are you sure you want to be doing this all by yourself? I'm sure. This stuff will go away faster, Peggy, if the press can't find me. Why would she do something like that to me? Because she is scared. Scared of what? When you get to be on the level that Olivia King is on, you got to work really hard to stay there. I mean, the whole business is looking for the next big thing. Sweetheart, you are the next big thing. All right? I'm gonna take a shower. You son of a bitch. Olivia knew. She knew exactly who you were. You found that picture, didn't you? What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about! Let me tell you something, little girl. Your mother don't know nothing about selling no records! All right? You think I care about that? Huh? That don't mean nothing to me. Give me this. This don't mean nothing to me. Who do you think I work for? I work for you! I'm trying to take you to the next level! I'm trying to make it happen! I'm out there doing the day-to-day work, all the time trying to make you move up. I made you hot! I did the work! You got a lot of growing up to do, little girl. And when you do, you're gonna realize that I did you a big favor. Get the hell out of here. I don't want to see you. I don't want to know you ever again. And I hate to say it, but my mother was right. She was right. Come on, baby, let's just make up. Move! Get out of here! Get out of my house! Peggy told me you were here. I didn't have anywhere else to go. Come on, baby. Hey. Hi. How long was I asleep? You've been sleeping for a long time. You want some coffee? There's some coffee in there. I know. I tried. Where's Rose when I need her? Yeah. You know, you were right about Ric. He was the one who told the tabloids. Aren't you gonna say, "I told you so"? I don't need to be right. Okay, maybe I do. And maybe I owe you an apology. But right now, I'm just not ready to say it. Hey. Hey, just in time. I heard the piano before. Are you writing? Yeah, just trying to work on a little something. I had some thoughts, some ideas. Can I hear it? Uh... Okay. But you know it's not really finished yet. What I'm... I'm just trying to get used to writing again. I haven't been writing in a long time. And, you know, I'm not sure it's any good. My macaroni and cheese is gonna be good, though, and my biscuits. Yeah, right. You know how to make macaroni and cheese? I can cook. I was a real person once. Yeah. Why don't you tell me about that person? Well, it's not that interesting. All right, well, tell me how you met my dad. How I met your dad. Okay. Well, we met in a little club. You did not meet my dad in a club. My dad doesn't go to clubs. He used to go to clubs. I met your dad in a tiny little club in a basement. And he was playing in a band, playing saxophone. My dad was in a band? Your dad was the most gorgeous man I had ever met. I was really turned on, just like, whew, right away. He was really great. So you met him, then what? You want all the details? Yes, give me details. This is my dad you're talking about. Well, it's simple. We met, we fell in love, and got married, and had you. Then? And then, what was so good turned out to be not so good, that's all. Go sit down over there and I'm gonna get this macaroni and cheese. But then I want to hear your song. Only if you clean your plate. All right. Come on, come on, come on. You wash these carrots? OLIVIA: This is a work in progress, okay? Okay. Okay.
