WOMEN IN HEAT BEHIND BARS Damn foreigner... What the hell is she thinking? I bet everyone else is having fun out there right now. No... No... Hold on for a second. What's the matter now? Shinobu? Mr. Sakae! It's been six years. I'm heading home. No! You are- You were the first person I ever fell in love with. I joined the track team because of you even though I wasn't good at running. I remember you were the worst runner in the team's history. I'm sorry. I was scared. Are you sure about this? Please be gentle. This is my first time. I can't do that. Come on. I'm begging you! No means no! I said no. It's a robbery! Someone, help! - What are you doing?! - It won't start! Wait for me! Come on! - What happened? - I got robbed! It's them! - Hey, you! - Don't move! ASAHI FEMALE PRISON PRISON WARDEN It will be confusing since this is your first time here. But always follow the guards' orders without any problems. Don't ever go against the guards. Do you understand? Yes. I hear you've never confessed about your accomplice. She's tougher than you think, so take good care of her. Get inside. This is Shinobu Himeno. She's joining you starting today. Don't cause any trouble. What are you doing?! Please give it back. Newbie! Give them back! Here! - Give them back! - Shut up. Give them back! You aren't allowed to give your supplies to others, right? What an idiot! Don't you act prim and proper. Come here! Come on! - No! - This isn't like the outside! There is no place to run! No! No! Please don't! No! Please stop! This is what we do to a newbie! No! No! You got such great tits! Come on! Please! I'm begging you! Spread her legs. Please stop! No! Come on! Spread them wide open! Please don't! It hurts! No! Relax already! Come on! No! No! Stay away from me! Why are you always so rebellious? If you don't like the punishment, behave more honestly. You give me no choice. Hey, what's going on with you tonight? What is it? Something happened? Lick them clean. This one, too. How is it? You like it? It's incredible. - Darling... - You- What the hell are you doing?! - And you! - No! You slut! - Stop it! - Didn't I tell you to stay away from her?! You prefer women that much? Huh?! Watch this really good! No! Please don't! What are you doing? Hey! What's the matter with you? It's nothing. Nothing to do with you! Cell 17, roll call! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. All six, accounted. - Good. - Cell 18, roll call! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. All six, accounted. - Good. - Cell 19, roll call! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. All five, accounted. Good. Cell 20, roll call! - 1, 2, 3... - Did you enjoy the night? Good. Cell 21! Y-Yes! Cell 21, roll call! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. All five, accounted! Good. - What do you have in your hand? - Nothing! Don't- Show it to me! Damn it! What the hell is this?! Go ahead. Keep walking! Were you going to smoke it? - There is nothing to see here! - Whatever, you bitch! What did you call me?! You should not disobey her. She's killed many inmates and reported them as death from sickness. What are you doing? What do you mean? It's not finished yet. Oh! I'm so sorry! If you take that now, I'll be in trouble! Thanks. What's going on? It's nothing. It doesn't look like "nothing." What happened? - I don't know. - You saw it, didn't you? - Who knows. - Yoshioka. It's you, isn't it? I know nothing. How could you not know? I had nothing to do with it! What's the cause of all this? Which one of you started it? Was it Himeno or you? If you don't want to talk, that's fine. All of you in Cell 21 are responsible! - Guard Yamashina. Keep your eyes on them. - Yes, sir. What is it? Check Shinobu Himeno's back pocket. Himeno, stand up. Yes, sir. What? This is some kind of mistake! Please let me go! Shut up! Be quiet. You are too soft! You must be tough on them, or they will get cocky. Ask Mr. Kiya to help you reign them in. Mr. Kiya is here for that reason. Yes. Please don't do it. What were you going to do with those scissors? I didn't steal them! Were you going to stab someone with them? No way! No! Don't! No! Why? I didn't do anything! Be quiet! Lick them. Lick them! Don't consider yourself a human. Think of yourself as an insect, then this won't bother you. Please don't- You have such beautiful skin. No! Really. Such beautiful skin. No! But... It won't last too long. All the women's skin will age no matter what. No! Please stop! No! No! No! No! No! Stop! Mr. Sakai... Please help me... - I'm so tired! - It's finally over. Excuse me... - Are you sure about this? - Yes. Tanabe might have stolen a needle. - Tanabe. - What?! It hurts! Stop it! Let me- Be quiet. What? What did I do? - Let go of me! You are so dirty! - Shut up. You saw it, didn't you? What do you mean? I see. Really. Take your clothes off and line up! Shut the hell up! - Be quiet! - How dare you! Damn you! - What's so funny?! - What are you laughing at?! Himeno! What's so funny?! Open your mouth! Open wider! Stick your tongue out. Tell me the truth now! I'll let you off the hook. You don't learn, do you? Fine. This is your last chance. Who took the needle and where is it? Very well. As a punishment, your meals will be reduced for one week! - What?! - No! I saw it with my own eyes! It won't make any difference if there is no evidence! Please forgive me! I'll let you off the hook this time only. But do you understand about the next time?! Yes. I may let you get parole depending on the info you get. Thank you so much. You stupid bitch! You know, don't you?! Tell me where it is! Come on! Say it! You'd better watch carefully when you tell on us next time. Good luck earning your brownie points. Do you want me to take care of her? Move. You see? Drink up. - No... - Clean it up with your pretty mouth. Please forgive me! Come on! What are you whining about? Lick it clean now! Come on! That's it. Lick it good. Beginning today, your duties will be switched. Meditate now! Enough. Start eating. Thank you for the food. I'm glad they didn't find it. You think I owe you something? I didn't mean it... You can't survive in here if you are soft. You can only rely on yourself. How dare you feed us pig's food! What did you just say?! She'll be punished! Continue with your meal! Come here! Hurry up! You are such a bad girl. You like me that much, huh? You want this, don't you? Do you remember? When you burned your husband's lover to death? Didn't you feel relieved when you saw his lover's house on fire? That's what you said in your confession. Look at your face right now! You are on fire, aren't you? Mr. Sakai... I'll be stronger. Where is daddy? He left early. He is waiting for us. Mrs. Yoshioka? I smell gas! Mrs. Yoshioka! Do you want us to call 911? Mrs. Yoshioka? Mrs. Yoshioka! I smell gas! Are you home? Mrs. Yoshioka! Mrs. Yoshioka! Are you home, Mrs. Yoshioka? K-Kaori? Kaori! Kaori! K-Kaori... Me... Child... - Pretty. - Oh, thank you. - How old? - Four... Four years old. - Four years old? - Yes, four years old. Don't you bring your boy's picture in here! - It's time to start working! - Yeah, let's do this. Go on. I lost... ...to my own body. Right here... I felt so weak... Do you know what I mean? How sad to be a woman... Miki? But I'm going to do it. No matter what. Excuse me... May I? What is it? Can we talk about my parole? What are you talking about? You promised me a parole when I tipped you off about Yamazaki... who was planning an escape. I don't recall it. What? I'm just kidding. Of course, I remember. But you won't be paroled for quite some time still. What?! I can't let go of someone so useful like you! How dare you! Release me, bitch! Watch your mouth! - You! - Yuka, don't! Let go of me, damn it! - What the hell are you two doing?! - Let go of me! - Stop resisting and come here! - Don't you touch me! Such a dirty trick she used... Using a parole as a bait... She used me so much... It's raining. I can't wait to get out of here. Don't you want to get out, too? Right? Don't you want to be held by your man? I want to fuck so bad... I want to fuck a man so bad. I want to fuck. It feels good, doesn't it? More! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. - All five, accounted! - Good. - Cell 20, roll call! - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. - All five, accounted. - Good. - Cell 21, roll call! - 1, 2, 3, 4. Five occupants, four accounted. Miki Tanabe is being disciplined. - Otherwise, no problem. - Good. Cell 22, roll call! - I'm so hungry. - How long will our punishment continue? The warden is so strict lately. She wants to be promoted and become a government official. She thinks she's something. Hey. Take care of this, will you? Do your work yourself. What did you say?! Who the hell do you think you are?! Hey. Shinobu Himeno! Yes. The warden would like to see you. Yes. You will get paroled. Congratulations. I'm sure the time flew by since this place is so comfortable. Yes. Hey, Tanabe. I can still see you even after you get paroled. Did you hear the scream? You are funny. That's impossible. This is a very peaceful prison. You can't bring your personal items in here! What the hell are you doing?! Calm down! Hey, stop it! Get them! Take this, you stupid asshole! Hey, stop it! Let me go! What do you think you are doing?! Wait a minute! - You bitch! - Get her now! - Stop! - Take this, asshole! - Hey, hold it there! - Don't you come near me! Stop it! Help! - Uchiyama, call for backup! - Got it! - You bitch! - Get them! This started in Factory 1! It's spreading to the entire prison! I declare Emergency Level One! I will command the operation! We can't avoid some casualties. Get them under control quickly! Yes, madam! Get out of my way. I thought this place was peaceful. You won't ever get out of here if you did this. And you won't get your promotion after this. What did you say? Let go of me! Let go! I won't forget about this! This is an emergency! This is an emergency! The riot has started in Factory 1. Take an emergency position now! - Ride him! Yeah! - Do it harder! - I'm next! - That's it! I can't... breathe... Let me do it! Come on! No thanks! Stop it! - Do it! - Yeah! Hey, stop right there!! Release me right this moment! Or you will face the consequences! - Get her! - I'll do it, too! No! Stop it! Come on! Put this in your mouth! - That hurts! - Do it harder! Take this, bitch! - Stop struggling! - Spread your legs! - Take this! - Shut up, bitch! I'm going to kill you! Are you OK? I regret that something like this has happened here. Even though your actions were not acceptable... ...the management's behaviors were at fault as well. There were unlawful actions taken by the former guards, including the warden. They were all fired right away. - Regarding this incident... - Take that, motherfucker! - You won't face any disciplinary actions... - The new one seems decent. There is no such thing as a decent warden. PRISON WARDEN I'm sure you've learned a lot from living in here. Even after you get out of here, use the experience... ...and become a great human being. Yes, madam. I heard that you fought like hell against the former warden. And you were the one who injured Mr. Kiya severely. You heard it wrong. How terrible... Thank you for everything. Thank you so much. - Good luck with everything! - Thanks.
