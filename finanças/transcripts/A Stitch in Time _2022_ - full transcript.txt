Alfred, coming in for a beer, mate? No, not tonight, I'm going home. Where's Kenny? He's in Europe, climbing a mountain. Why do you know him? I'm a regular, I'm here with Duncan the singer. He's good. What's your name? - Liebe. - I'm Charlie. ♪ And the emptiness ♪ And the emptiness If I give you this $1.50, could I have that $5 note? Yes, sure, of course. I collect $5 notes. Cheers, see you. Not supposed to sound like that, sorry. Try it again. ♪ When I washed away the tears of my life ♪ ♪ On the road again ♪ Coming ready or not to the river ♪ ♪ The storms grow louder as the sun goes down ♪ ♪ And the clouds go gray ♪ Here the mysteries of heaven will have to wait ♪ ♪ Why there ain't no answers ♪ When the church bells ring ♪ And all my words are scattered time after time ♪ ♪ When I'm on the road to you ♪ I'm on the road to you Your songs were very beautiful tonight, my love. Go and wait for me in the car. Duncan? What? I heard you coughing on stage, mate. Are you okay? Yeah, sorry, should have brought the medicine. It won't happen again. I think you should take a couple of weeks off and recover properly. It's okay, I'll be all right. No, seriously, I think you should take a break. And I want you to have a think about your legacy. My what? Well, we want to build a hall of fame, and we want people to remember you as something special. I see. Gary used to say you were the heart and soul of this place. Yeah, well, he was a special guy, wasn't he? He really knew how to promote an act. Well, I'm sure it must've been easier back in those days. I'm sorry? You firing me? Duncan... I mean, have the guts to say it, if that's what it's all about. We're just not getting the numbers anymore. And if we're not careful, it'll be the end of all of us, and then none of us would be working. I see. Look, times are changing, man, and we've gotta change with it. We've gonna start looking to attract a younger crowd. With what? A different act, a young band that'll make a lot of noise and bring all of their friends to come and watch them play, friends that will spend money and buy drinks. And that's your marketing strategy? Pretty much, yeah. I mean, you've got Liebe who buys one fucking drink, and makes the place look like a retirement village. Are you fucking kidding me? Look, I'm sorry, that was unfair, I'm sorry. Well, when Gary was here, and it wasn't being run by a fucking idiot, it was full every night, and you're blaming me? Well, I know it seems harsh. Well firing me won't hide the fact that you haven't got a fucking clue what you're doing. Well, you know what? What? You are fired. Well fuck you. 'Cause you're a boring performer, you're a fucking asshole. Right. And we don't want you back here, unless it's afternoon bowling with the rest of the geriatrics. Well, fuck you, and fuck your stupid hall of fame. I'll make sure your final payment goes through tonight. Go to fucking hell. I made some lemon and honey for you. For God's sake, if I wanted your help, I'd ask for it. I'm sorry, it's my chest and my head, they're killing me. God. There you go, that'll be $15.20, thank you. Now if I give you $20.20, could I have a $5 note? You sure can. Thank you. Thank you very much. You're very kind. So I like it in the pink, and then we could drop by Douggie. Yeah, that's a good idea. Wait, give me a sec. Why don't you try it on? I think it belongs on someone beautiful. And you're not? I've seen better days. Why don't you try on this one? It'll let everyone see you're a real class act. Oh my goodness, you're very kind, but I'm only looking really. I used to make clothes and sell them here when I was young. Oh, you must have seen a lot of changes. Yes, but most things are still the same. Where are you from? China. The Chinese were very good to us during the war. The Australians? The Jews. You're Jewish? Well, technically I am, but I was raised as a Christian. Have you been there, to China? No, but I heard the stories. I was sent from Germany to England on one of the kinder transports. And I only came to Australia after I finished my schooling. With your parents? They were murdered by the Nazis. Sorry to hear that. It's okay, I was only young, and I don't... You know, you remind me a lot of my grandmother. Is she a nosy old chatterbox like me? No, not at all. She's lovely, and I miss her a lot. I'm sure she misses you too. I'm sure she's very proud. Well, I'd love to know what you think, if you'd care to try it on. I don't get much of a chance to work with any mature models, certainly not as elegant as you. Oh please. Hey, you look great. Come and look at yourself. I'm not doing your dress much justice, I'm afraid. Well you're not here for dress, the dress is here for you. Oh. Okay, turn around. Stand proud, know that it lifts you. Okay, how clever. To find yourself you must lose yourself in the service of others. What a beautiful thing to say. Mahatma Gandhi said it. Where's the bacon? We have to be careful now you're no longer playing. We can't have it every day. It was such a beautiful morning and I was walking through... Honestly, what's a man's life if he can't have a bit of bacon? We'll have it again tomorrow and every second day. It'll make it more special when we do have it. That's ridiculous, and you don't have to speak to me like I'm a child. I was thinking of making clothes again to bring in some extra money. I beg your pardon? I was thinking of making clothes again and selling them at the markets. Why would you do that, you didn't make any money last time? I did make some. No, you didn't. You were too slow, and your material was too expensive. The whole thing was nonsense, I remember. Well, I want to give it another go, and this time it might be different. I can use my $5s to get started. Oh, that's lovely, isn't it? We're rationing bacon, and you want to spend money on your silly ideas. Well, they're my special $5s to do with as I please. Yes, but hoarding doesn't mean you earned it, Liebe, and it's a pretty selfish attitude even if you had. I just want to do something to help. Well you'll not gonna become the bread winner at the sudden whim of a bloody hat. All I want is a bit of peace and quiet. Anyway, young people want simple clothes these days. They're not interested in all that fancy stuff. How do you know? You don't know a damn thing about fashion. All I know is I don't wanna hear that bloody machine chattering 24 hours a day while I'm trying to write my music. Justin, yeah, it's me Duncan. Yeah, how you been? Yeah, it has been a long time. Yeah, I've heard you've made quite a success out of your life, that's great. Yeah, that's really great. Yeah, I'm doing well, had a regular gig at the RSL for some time, but now I'm getting ready to record an album, yeah. So I'm quite busy. Yes, it has been a long time coming. What? Yes, I'm still with Liebe. Gosh, she's like a stray dog that one. Latched on for life, you know what I mean. What was that? Oh, you're still in love with Christine. Wow, that's great, that's wonderful. Yes, I think they would love to see each other. Certainly been a while. Thursday? Yeah, okay. Hang on, what's the address? Huh-uh. Right, yeah, okay. That sounds good. All right, well, I'll speak to you then. Yeah, great to speak to you, Justin, bye. You don't have to ask Justin for money. I can give you all my $5 notes for your recording. I don't want your $5 notes, Liebe, it's the attitude, if you wanna help, put some bacon on the table, and make sure you get along with Christine. But we always got along. It's gonna take a lot more than a bunch of $5 notes to make a successful album. Oh my goodness, Liebe, is it really you? Yes, it's really me. - Liebe. - Oh hello, Justin, it's wonderful to see you. Look at you, look at us. We've turned into a couple of old ladies. Oh, but very graciously. The girls seem happy to see each other again, don't they? Shame our differences kept them apart. This is for you. Oh, Liebe, why did you do that? Let's go inside. Care for a beer? Wouldn't say no. Oh, Liebe, this is the dress I tried on all those years ago. It is. You remembered? And you kept it for me all this time. I remember how much you loved it, and how beautiful you looked when you tried it on. I did love it, I loved it a lot. So I could never sell it to anyone else. Silly girl, we didn't have a lot of money back then. And you tried to give it to me for free, I remember. And I wouldn't accept it. Well, I hope you accept it now as a special gift. I do, but now I can afford to pay you. Oh no, Christine, please don't. Yes, I insist. Here. This is way too much. No, it's not, it includes inflation. I pay twice as much for dresses that are absolute rubbish. This is an absolute bargain, and I'll hear nothing more about it. I have been thinking of making dresses again, and selling them at the markets. You should. You don't think that's a silly idea? Of course not, don't know why you ever stopped in the first place. I fell in love. Yes, you did. But that made you happy, didn't it? It's been a struggle. Look, let me get this off my chest, so we can both move on once and for all. I just wanna say it. Sure. I forgive you. Oh, thanks, mate. I forgive you for quitting the band when we were just about to sign. Oh, come on. And I forgive you for not understanding what that did to me personally, and to all our careers. Well you should have moved on, stopped using me as an excuse. Yeah, but you made us look uncommitted, and ruined the only chance we had. But I forgive myself for thinking badly about you and Christine, and attacking you for selling out, when you had every right to go off and do your own thing. You finished? Yeah, that's all I wanted to say. Are you expecting me to apologize along with you? No, I'm not. I came here to offer you billing on the album as a token of peace. You want me to play on your album? Yeah, I want you to be part of it. Yeah, but I haven't played in over 40 years. Yeah, but it's nothing complicated. It's just a couple of simple tracks. Then we can finally say we did it. This is a surprise. Who did you sign with? Ah, no one officially as yet, but I've got a whizzbang producer lined up who wants first pick. Right, so you're paying for it. It's an investment. Look, don't make a decision until you've had a listen, but these are some of my best songs and I'm getting some amazing feedback. Why don't I let you hear something, so you know what I'm talking about? Then you can come in on it if you want. I'll give you 50%, or anything you want. Main thing is to get the album out there and not worry about the details. We gave up everything to support our men. You're no different, Liebe, we all did it. But he's certainly not happy about it. Tell him to bugger off and do what you like. Can you hear him singing? It is beautiful, isn't it? It is. I guess you could say I've been lucky in other ways. ♪ Any better at all ♪ So on and on you walk until you fall ♪ ♪ Holding on He was singing at the RSL, but suddenly that job has gone. And he's become impossible to live with. It was his only gig for years, and now he has nothing. At least he has you. But I never made him happy. But he loves you, doesn't he? He's never said that. ♪ What's out there Well, what do you think? How old are you? I'm the same age as you. We went to school together, remember? Watching you chase childhood dreams at your age is not inspiring to me. It's exhausting. I mean the game's over I would have thought, you're an old man. Were you listening to the song, or just waiting to tell me that? Mate, I don't like it, I'm sorry. I'm sure there's someone out there who probably does, but I don't. And I'm not interested in playing music anymore. I have everything I need. But you didn't come here because you wanted me to play on your album, or to make everything good between us, you came because you needed the money to do it, didn't you? I meant it as an investment, that's all. I'm not begging. Don't enjoy the moment too much, mate. You know why I left? Because you were drugged out, fucking around, and completely off the rails. And I couldn't believe in the dream anymore, and wanted a life. So fuck you for laying it all on me. Seriously, and you would've replaced me the second you had a chance. Who said that, her? But, no, I don't want to see you begging. It's pathetic. I wish you'd come straight out and say how much you need, $20,000, $40,000, it makes no difference to me. But if it keeps Christine happy, and gets you off my back, you can run around all you like playing the big shot, I don't care. But don't look me in the eye and call yourself an investment. That's the biggest joke I ever heard. You are an asshole. The best thing you ever had going for you was Liebe. And you treated her like shit, and probably still do. But hey, that's none of my business, is it? So let's transfer some money, and then we can eat. I'm fucking starving. How much do you want? Nothing. Yes, you do, that's precisely why you're sitting here in my house. You're selling out, Duncan. There's no difference between us. Liebe, we're going. Liebe! Liebe! What's going on? Can you get Liebe for me please, we're going. But what about dinner? What did you say to him? Come on, we're not staying around here a minute longer with these dickheads. Come on, we're going. Come on, Liebe, we're going. Justin, say something. Duncan, you're an idiot, a deadbeat, and a fucking loser. Okay? For God sake. Liebe, I'll call you soon. We'll stay in touch. No, you won't, you'll stay out of our fucking lives. I'm so sorry. What's wrong with you? You've already ripped her away from me, now you bring her back into my life, and you ripped her away again. This whole thing was a mistake. Can I help you? I'm a little bit lost. It's quite a while since I've been here and everything's changed. I'm looking for the beaded appliques. Sure, I've got plenty of those. You just head down there to the right. Do you want me to show you? I'd be grateful. Sure. Mrs. Greenfield, how wonderful to see you. Where have you been, Liebe, we missed you so much. Oh thank you. I didn't expect to see you, but this is marvelous. Yes. You're looking so well. I'm okay, how are you, darling? I'm so-so, I'm surviving. That's already half the battle. Okay, so that'll be $335 and 55 cents. 100, 200, 300 and 50. That's right. Will you turn that bloody thing off please, I'm trying to concentrate down here? Oh man. Ahh! Further south in New South Wales, and there's that stormy weather... it's a fairly chilly start, a touch of fog around through the south especially with that high really moving in. I wonder if I may bother you for your opinion. Sure, you helped me, didn't you? I did. It's just that one gets carried away when one's on one's own, until one sees the results. It occurs to me I might be a bit out of touch. All I need to know is if I'm wasting my time. Sure, I understand. It's not a typical dress, I know. No, it's not. A bit old fashioned? Yeah, in a way. Hmm. Summerly, could you try this on for a sec. Yeah. I'm sorry about this. That's fine. It's fine, she'll be all right. It's beautiful, Hamish. Wow. Is this our new dressmaker? The craftsmanship is beautiful. This is Liebe Miller, Summerly, the dress is entirely hers. Wow, you're like a real couture dressmaker. Thank you, how nice of you to say that. She's going to come back and sell dresses here at the market. You should take the stall next to us. It's beautiful. I don't think we're gonna let you out of our sight. And where have you been? I went for a walk. With a garbage bag? I took the dress to the markets to show a nice young designer who's been very supportive, who thinks it's beautiful I might add. Well, she would, wouldn't she? What's that supposed to mean? Well, you don't expect it to be honest, do you? Why would anyone lie to me? Well, because no one wants to upset an old lady. That's ridiculous. Look, if you want a professional opinion, talk to professionals, not some deadbeat down at the bloody markets. Try walking into Westfield with your garbage bag, see how ridiculous you look then. Well, if you think it's rubbish, throw it in the bin. Just forget about him, he'll never support you. I know. That's just what men are like. If you succeed, what does it say about him? What does it matter if it helps us both? You're so innocent, Liebe, just do what you want, and don't let him get to you. I think what he thinks is that what I'm doing means I don't believe in him anymore. Well, that's not true, is it? No, but even if his record came out tomorrow, it would still take a long time, wouldn't it? Yes, it would. And there's nothing you can do to help that. No, well, this is giving me something to do, rekindling something I'd forgotten about. It's exciting for me. That's probably what he hates the most. Oh gosh. What should I do? Just tell him to bugger off and mind his own business. I'm sure that would go down very well. Oh, hang on. Who you talking to? I'm just talking to my friend. You haven't got any friends. Are you gossiping with Christine? No. Give me the phone. We weren't gossiping. Hello? Are you seriously that paranoid, a girl can't even have a bit of privacy? Not to gossip with the likes of you. I thought I made myself clear. Oh for God sake, Duncan. The band was torn apart, careers were left in tatters because of you, because all you wanna do is talk, bitch, and gossip. She didn't do that, she was being nice. When are you gonna accept responsibility for yourself, Duncan? You're so focused on being hard done by, you can't see when someone's trying to help you. Is that what you think you're doing? I told Justin to give you that money, whatever you wanted, and you just threw it back in his face. Bye, Christine. Oh for God sake, Duncan. I don't want you talking to Liebe, and I can assure you she won't ever want to talk to you. I will talk to you, Christine. You're an asshole. I'll call you whenever I like. Still cheating on her, are you? Give me the phone. How dare you, you know how I feel about Christine, and suddenly you're the best of friends again. Where's your loyalty? I'm not your stray dog, I deserve a life. That's Christine talking. She's my friend. You haven't spoken to her in years. Only because of you. Look, Liebe, she's playing you like a little child. That's her way of getting to me. Don't be ridiculous. She enjoys it, twiddling things and meddling in other people's lives, it's her way of having fun. She's not like that. She's kind and she's generous. Well, you're not talking to her, and that's it. And if you don't like it, there's the bloody door. Go and see if she'll put up with you, and see how long your little friendship lasts then. I'm sure you'd be glad to see the back of me. Actually, I would. I'll be very happy indeed. Why do you hate me so much? Don't play that game, you latched onto me, remember, and never let go. I deserve some credit for not throwing you out on the street, okay. I gave you some tremendous loyalty. I expect a little bit in return, and for you to stop driving me insane with that wretched bloody machine. And now I'm to have nothing? If that's the way you feel, that everything I've given you isn't good enough. But I'm not good enough. What on earth are you doing? I'm leaving you. Again? But this time I'm not coming back. Is that actual promise? Yes, I'm relieving you from the burden of having me. So that you can reach your dreams and finally be happy. Well it'll be nice to have a bit of peace and quiet around here for a change. Good. Well I've made the breakfast, there's lots of bacon. It's getting cold. And I've left the $5s for you to do with as you please. I see. So, goodbye then, Duncan. Is all this drama really necessary? Liebe, where do you think you're going? I'll see you in a couple... a couple of days. Oh Christine, it won't fit. Okay, put it in the front. No, don't close the door, it closes itself. I'll take it in the front with me. No, put it in the front. Hang on, no, you have to open that one yourself. Great. Where's the engine? Don't worry about it. No, you have to close that one yourself. You have to push this one, you have to push it hard. No, harder. Good, let's go. Where's the handle? Magic. It's very complicated. I know. Okay, let's go. Thank God, this is the last lot. You okay? God, I've got muscles where I've never had them before. This could be the death of me. So heavy. Are you sure Justin doesn't mind? God, no, he set this up as a guest room, but no one ever visits us, because we're a million miles from anywhere. He also built himself a pool, which he never uses. He thinks it's just there for show. How anyone ever thought he was going to be a rock star is beyond me. We're supposed to be retired and traveling the world in luxury, but all he ever does is work. He doesn't like to have a break? God, no, he wouldn't know what to do with himself. He is the most incredibly boring human being. But at least I have you now so we can hang out together and have a bit of fun. We don't need these bloody men. You are so good to me, Christine, but you must tell me how much I have to pay in rent. I'll be able to pay as soon as I start selling the dresses. Don't be silly, oh my dear old Liebe, you don't have to pay me for anything. It's just wonderful to have someone to talk to. Oh, you know what, we should take the Thunderbird and drive to Fremantle. You want to drive to Perth? God, yes. But it's a long way. It would take us a week. I know, and we won't tell anyone where we're going, we'll just go, straight through the bloody outback. It'll be outrageous fun. Can you imagine? I'm going to get a bottle of champagne to celebrate. Christine, my hands are still shaking from all of this. Oh Liebe, you poor old thing, come and sit down, come on. Oh my God, your whole life is spinning on its head, and I'm just rattling on at a million miles an hour. It's all too much, isn't it? I just need a few moments to rest and breathe. Of course you do. Maybe we could celebrate tomorrow. Tomorrow would be perfect. Thank you, Christie. Well, you have everything you want, and all your things? I think so. Wonderful. It all seems surreal, like a dream. Well it isn't, and you know, if you want to you can stay here for the rest of your life. Oh, Christine. What the hell is that? Liebe! Oh my goodness, Justin. It's five o'clock in the morning. Did I wake you? I didn't realize you could hear anything. Well, we can. I'm so sorry. The bones in this old machine are as rickety as mine, I'm afraid. Well if you could refrain from using it until 8:00 AM, it would be greatly appreciated. Of course. Yeah. I'm terribly sorry. Right, okay. Oh, I must be late. Yeah. Ah, my past has come back to haunt me. Hello? Yes, I know exactly where she is. I'm not going to tell you I'm afraid. She's very happy. Well go and see a doctor, what do you expect her to do about it? No, you had your chance, Duncan, now bugger off and leave her alone. Why don't you let them talk it out for themselves? What, and let him suck her back into that toxic relationship when she's finally broken free. Why are you interfering? That's the whole point of an intervention. Look, he might be a lot of things, but he'd never hit her or harm her in any way, I'm sure of that. You seriously don't get it, do you? As far as I'm concerned, the sooner they sought this thing out, the better. Only for your sake. Well, do you want her living upstairs for the rest of our lives? Yes, as a matter of fact, I wouldn't mind. And this is what you want for our life? I don't have a life. Of course you don't. Da-da. You look gorgeous. Well, it's your creation. I heard the machine stop, I thought you might be finished. I've only finished the sewing. Oh, well, Justin will be pleased. I still have a lot of work to do with the finishing touches. Is it really necessary, they look good? Well it's what makes each dress unique. It's all part of the bigger vision. Well I have a vision. We are going to go and have a manicure, and then we're going to go to a very posh women's lunch at a posh restaurant. Oh, come on, Liebe, you haven't been out of the room for a week. But I have to finish them. No, you don't. I do. I can take care of you now. I know you mean that, but I can't be a burden on anyone anymore. Oh, God, don't be so silly. I can't, and I won't. Are you seriously going to sew all that on by hand? I have to. They're not going to stay on by themselves. No, I mean, can't you get a machine to do it? What sort of machine? I dunno, we're not living in the dark ages though, are we? You just have to be patient, and besides I enjoy it. Oh, well I suppose I'd better go off to the ladies brunch on my own. I'm exhausted just watching you. I'm sorry, Christine. This might be fun for you, Liebe, but it's not a lot of fun for me. I respect that you need to get this out of your system. Look, I do, and I support that. Thank you. Hey, Liebe. Good to see you. Good morning, Hamish. Hey, come on, let me take these off you. Thank you, you're very kind. What a relief to get here. How long did it take you to get here? Oh, I came in by train, and I had to get up so early. So you using old patterns or new ones? Did you make them yourself, the patterns? Yes, I have to. Why, is something wrong? No, not at all. It's just hard to find somebody who can make a good pattern, seriously impossible. I'm full of confidence when I'm on my own. But now I'm here, I'm full of doubt. Well you just have to be a bit patient, that's all. The owners are out there somewhere, Liebe, I'm quite sure of it. I didn't think I'd have it so beautiful, and my who family's coming and it means so much to me. Well it looks so good on you. Thank you, Liebe, you're the most wonderful person I've ever met. You're very welcome. Bye. Hey, your first sale? Well I sort of gave it to her for free. You did what? Why? She couldn't afford it? That's her problem, Liebe, not yours. I mean, you're not a charity. How do you expect to make any money? Hamish, I think this whole thing has been a terrible mistake. I've been standing here all day, and no one's even looked at me. And if a poor young girl shows some appreciation. No, Liebe, don't even start going there. Stop being so negative. You just have to stand there, that's all. And be a bit patient, okay. And stop throwing away any more of your money, that's it. Hello. Excuse me, what sort of material is this? It's a silk chiffon. It's beautiful to wear. I can imagine. Do you mind if I try this on? Yes, please. Liebe, where have you been? I went to the markets. Oh God, how did it go? Absolutely marvelous. Really? I sold two dresses on my very first day. You're kidding me, you should have told me, I would have come and picked you up. It's okay, I took the train. Well, we are going to drink cocktails tonight to celebrate, and I won't take no for an answer. I can't, I've gotta go to Surry Hills in the morning, and buy more material. What on earth for? I've got to increase my range. I've got so much work to do. Don't you think you've already proven your point? I'm not trying to prove a point, Christine, I'm trying to make a living. Liebe, you really are impossible. Well, I'll drive you to Surry Hills in the morning, but tonight you're gonna have a glass of champagne with me, and we're gonna watch "Thelma and Louise". Well, okay, as long as I can put my feet up and rest, I've had quite a big day. How's your day been? Good, very good. I'm retired so I can do what I like. Sounds wonderful. Except I don't have anyone to do what I like with. Can you see my dilemma? I'm sorry, Christine. Duncan called again. What did he want? Nothing, he caught a cold or something and went off to the clinic with a headache. Maybe I should give him a call. God, no, that would be the worst thing you could do for both of you. You don't think ringing him would be the right thing to do? Liebe, how can you start a new life when you're running backwards and forwards every five minutes blowing his nose? You're not his minder, he can look after himself. I guess so. He's not ringing you because he cares about you. You know that don't you? Yes. Fuck you. I don't think he's gonna apologize. Nah, I don't think so. Stupid bitch. Christine! Christine! Yeah, I'm aware of what I said, but 2.5 is still a great deal. Either that or we buy it off of the bank for 1.5 in a couple of weeks. Now I've gotta go. Christine! What? Can you tell her to turn that machine off, it's driving me crazy. Are you serious? This is our home, not a bloody sweatshop. Shouldn't you be at your office annoying your staff. Oh, for God sake, Christine, sort this out. Liebe! Liebe! Oh Christine, I'm so sorry about the noise. Close your eyes, I bought you a gift. You did? Close your bloody eyes and turn round. But it's not my birthday. I know it's not your birthday, but I bought you something anyway. You can't do this, you've already been too kind to me, you have to stop this. Open your eyes. I asked for the Rolls Royce of sewing machines, and they gave me a bloody Toyota, can you believe it? What's wrong? I was worried my old machine wasn't going to make it. And I was worried it was never going to stop. So now we can all stop worrying about it and get some peace. Wow. Shall we open it? Right, the first thing we need's a bottle of champagne. Champagne is not actually mentioned in the manual, but it is strongly implied. I'm back. I did it. Oh shit. My goodness. Can you hear that, my darling? Hear what? I do hope you enjoy wearing it. It's the only one of its kind. I never make the same dress twice. Ah, precious. I'll have to get one next time. Thank you. Thank you. Do you want a coffee? Thank you, that would be lovely. Oh no, don't worry about it, I got it. You're so lucky to have Hamish. He wants to ask you to make a pattern out of one of his designs, but he's too afraid to ask you about it. He should just ask. He thinks it'll be too much trouble, with all your other work. Oh, that's silly. I'll talk to him when he gets back. I'm just around here. Who the hell's that? So the idea is to make a dress that's actually a skirt and a jacket but it's all made from the same material. But why don't you just make a standalone jacket that can go with lots of things. Why would you want to tie them together? No, so you can take off the jacket and change your entire appearance or... Or demeanor. Look, I wanna give a girl the same power a man has with his suit. You know, when he takes off his jacket and then puts it back on, it can really mean something and change the dynamics in a room. But obviously I still want her to be flirtatious and sexy, and feel like she's wearing a dress if she wants to. And you really want a neckline this wide? Yeah, and the lapel to frame the breasts as something to be proud of. Gosh, Hamish, you're taking it in the other direction, if you want her taken seriously. Come on, why should a girl have to choose between being sexy and being taken seriously? A woman shouldn't have to pretend to be a man just to earn the same level of respect. It's in the face of that whole level of conservatism. And it makes you think, you know, it's sophisticated, and why not let her use that discrimination to her advantage. I can keep the length and shorten it later, that's better than having it too short to begin with. Can I keep hold of these? Yeah, of course. You don't seem to like it very much, do you? It's not that, Hamish, it's just who's going to want to wear it with their breasts poking out. Hi, how did it go? Oh Christine, this is Hamish. Hi. Hello? I'm not interrupting anything, am I? No, no. No, don't get up. No, no. I wasn't expecting you'd be in here entertaining, certainly not someone so young and attractive. Thank you. This is my very best friend, Christine. It's nice to meet you. Very nice to meet you too. Hamish has been helping me set up at the markets. I didn't do much really, it was... Nonsense, you were my inspiration. Well Liebe's creating a pattern for one of my designs. Going to give it a go. Wow, you're turning this into quite a venture. Well, just a little one-off, that's all. Come on, now, we'll see about that. Her work's impeccable. It is, isn't it? So you're? A fashion designer. Of course, how wonderful. Would you like a drink? Why not? I've come for Liebe, and if you try and stop me I'll knock you off your bloody feet. Oh, come in, you grumpy old dickhead. Well! Where is she? Christine? It was pretty damn good. Christine! Liebe! Oh, for God sake. What the bloody hell is going on? Is everything okay? Leave her alone, Duncan. She doesn't want to see you, it's over, finished, okay? Why did you bring him in here? What do you bloody think? She's through with you, Duncan, don't you bloody get it? Is it possible you can stop interfering in other people's lives. Not if it concerns my friend. You have to let them sort it out themselves. Um, go out the back way. I'm sorry. Okay. Oh fuck you, Christine. Hey, I'm trying to help you, mate. I know how you treat her. Liebe, are you talking about me behind my back? No, she isn't, Duncan. She never mentions you, you're complete history, okay? Liebe! And who the fuck are you, you gotta thing for little old ladies, have we? Excuse me? Yeah, I saw you flirting with her today. Oh, for fuck's sake. And now you're up there doing God knows what. Duncan, leave him, he's a very nice man who's helping me at the markets. Is that what this is about? You can have a little affair with this Asian bastard. I don't wanna start anything, mate, but I'll finish it. Hamish, leave. You can't answer, eh? Not everyone just wants sex. You're unbelievable. I think we can safely say they're just friends. Can you shut the fuck up? Calm down, Duncan. And Christine, stop putting yourself between a man and his wife. If that's what he thinks, he should have married her and stopped screwing around. I'm fucking warning you. Stop it, Christine. You used her like a dishcloth right from the start. Stop it. And all the while fucking around with any woman you can get your hands on with no respect for anyone. That's right, I did fuck around with a lot of women. You should know, you were one of them. What? Exactly, now shut the fuck up. You're insane. No. You gonna stand there and deny it, while dare judging me. I don't know what he's talking about. Yes, you do, you betrayed Liebe more than anybody. She doesn't care about you. All she wants is revenge, that's all she's ever wanted. Are you fucking kidding me? She's a vindictive little bitch, and she'll stop at absolutely nothing. It's not true. So what do you think of your perfect world now, you stupid dumb fuck. No, Liebe, listen. Don't. It was nothing like that. Now get out of my house. I care about you, I care about you more than anything. Go away, please. Liebe! Liebe! I don't ever want to see you again, Duncan, ever! Liebe, this is share accommodation studying at the university. Why is it written in Chinese? Don't they speak English? So only Chinese people can read it. That's what they're looking for. Why wouldn't they want it a nice English lady? I don't know, and they only want a student. And it's talking about a garage, I mean, do you really want to live in a garage with no windows? Liebe, are you there? I'm down here, Hamish, come on down. Hey. What on earth's that? It's a housewarming, I got you a cutting board for the table. Can I put it there? Oh, yes, I'll clear it. Great, it's only secondhand, but there's not much to a cutting board, is there? No, no, it's marvelous. Thank you. Oh, it's got measurements, it'll make everything so much easier. So this is the new home? It is, who'd have imagined I'd wind up with having so much space, isn't it wonderful? What happens when you get cold? I have plenty of blankets and a heater, it really isn't that bad. Well, so long as you're comfortable. I am, and the students are lovely. Did you see them while you were up there? I did. So this is it? Well, yes. It looks good. Hah, however, I did know you wouldn't do it. Oh, Hamish. What? It's really what I want. Well I'll have to pull the neck out wide, like the drawing in the design. I thought you'd come to your senses when you saw it. Sorry, I haven't. I know. Look, I appreciate the concern and we need to bring the hemline up to around here. I'll just put in a pin. I'm gonna get 80 of them made in China. All exactly the same? No, as two different color combinations, with polka dots and two types of lapels. It's still quite a lot, though, isn't it? No, it's limited edition. People respect that and it's the only way to make money these days. Ah, it's a shame it always has to come back to that. Here it is, Liebe, nobody's bought it for years. It's all we've got left. Look at this, Hamish, it's jacquard damask brocade, which has a very long history, which started in the Middle East, and traded in Damascus. The only people to wear it were kings and queens, and very wealthy people. Well, have you seen the price? Well, they'll give me a discount, they're always very kind to me here. Where did she go? You know, with the amount of money and time you spend on these dresses, it's no wonder you don't make any money at all. I don't need much to survive. But you can cut a few corners. There's cheaper fabrics that are just as good, and no one's gonna know the difference. If people want cheap, they could go to Kmart. I have integrity. Is that what do you think I lack, integrity? Don't be silly, you're just trying to help me. But you can't, I'm just saying that beauty resonates from integrity, and you have no alternative but to consider whatever you can do to carry it, to carry that resonance. That's what it's all about. Well, I think it's a nice ideal, but if you... It's not a matter of opinion, Hamish, it's scientific. Resonance? Of course, oh, I wish I could have seen Professor Julius Sumner Miller. One night I saw him with two sets of musical instruments, which were not touching, but when he chimed the first set, the exact same note reverberated in the second set. That's how resonance works. Okay, but how does that relate to dresses? You're asking the wrong question, Hamish. You should be asking, "Why is it so?", that's what he used to say. Okay, right. Why is it so? It's not about the dresses, it's about me, I am the instrument, as are you. If I can't see beauty in the clothes I make, how can I expect anyone else to see it? That photo I took, and posted on Facebook calling you Grandma Couture, it's gone viral with over 10,000 hits. Goodness, is your computer okay, can it be fixed? I don't think so. Isn't that what happens when you're cyber attacked? Not exactly, no. Here's your receipt. Thank you. Cool, thanks. Ah, thank you, Hamish. Thanks for everything today, Liebe, seriously? You okay? Yeah, I'm fine, just need a bit of a lie down. Well, I'll talk to you soon. Damn. Hamish, here. Thanks. Liebe? Liebe? Liebe! Liebe, Liebe! Hey, you okay? Look at me. Oh, Hamish, I was having such a funny dream. I thought I was on the boat going across to England. Well you're here with me now. You were just having a lie down. I remember being so sick on that boat, it was so cold, and I missed my parents terribly. But look at me, oh, I'm so sweaty. I'm so sorry you should see me like this. No, you're all right. You look fine. Oh, we'd better go, get ready for the markets. We'd better set up before everyone comes. The markets are over, Liebe. Why? Did something happen? No, it's five o'clock. Is it? Yeah, they finished an hour ago. Oh, I must have been lying there all day. Come on. But all around me are ordinary members of the German public who have come here, some of them carrying bags of soft toys, which they intend to hand to the refugees and their children. Interestingly too, the welcome that the public are offering, is very much echoed by the German government, which has attracted criticism for its very open policy towards refugees. I left that place on a kinder transport, and I never went back. It's strange how I can only forgive them now. Where's your food? I told you. I can only find noodles, is that all you've been eating? That's all those poor students are eating, so if it's good enough for them. They're only students, Liebe, they're not refugees. They're wealthy Chinese kids whose parents are paying a lot of money for them to educated, who don't know how to look after themselves, and shouldn't be eating that sort of rubbish either. It's no wonder you're so sick. Are you coping okay? I thought, I always thought if I was just a good person God would look after me. It sounds so childish saying it out loud. Liebe, you hungry? Yes. Well the students made you some noodles with chicken. Oh, did they do that for me? Yeah. Ah, goodness. You're all very kind. It was a big team effort, we even called Tanya's mother in China to help to tell us what to do. Here. Thank you. It's all right. Here. He gets you a fork. Thank you. So we had a house meeting while you were sleeping, and we've come up with a pretty special proposition. If the students were to provide you with all the ingredients you need, they'd be very interested in you being the cook for the entire house. They want me to do that? They do, even Tanya's mother, apparently. Then everyone could eat better, including you. And it won't cost you a thing, and then you'll always get to eat good food for free. Oh thank you. You are welcome. Hmm, this is absolutely delicious. Thank you, Hamish. It's all right, now you do know how to cook though, right? Of course I do. When I was young, women weren't even supposed to leave the kitchen. Well, that's good. Cause I kinda told them you're like the "Iron Chef", and they're all very excited. Oh, Hamish. It's an e-commerce website. So now you can buy our dresses from anywhere you want. Oh, Hamish, look. How many people can see it? It's on the Internet, the whole world. That's incredible. Yeah, well we do live in amazing times. Liebe! Thank goodness you're still here. My Auntie Tridara asked how I could afford such a beautiful dress. And I told her that you gave to me for free. So she painted you this picture it. It's magnificent. Oh, please tell your auntie I love it. I will. Is that Tridara Brisba? Yeah, she's my auntie. Wow, she's famous, Liebe. Be worth a fortune. You can sell it if you like. Don't be silly, I could never do anything of the sort. I'm going to hang it on a wall somewhere special. She said she's never seen anyone look more beautiful in her life before. Well you tell your auntie my dress had very little to do with it. Thank you, Liebe. Oh, it's astounding. Hello. Do you speak English? Yes. So how's everything going? Good. And you and Justin? Oh, we're fine, really we're fine. Good, I'm glad. Liebe, what happened with Duncan only ever happened once and it was a long time ago. Were you in love with him? I dunno. I was young and stupid, and I always knew he was yours. No. Liebe, I've come to tell you that he's in a hospice at St. Vincent's, but it doesn't look good. Did you see him? No. What about his brother? I don't think so, I doubt it. How long has he been so sick? Quite a while I think. I'm not sure when he was diagnosed, in fact, I don't actually know much about it at all. Only that he called the house again the other night. Anyway, I'd better go and let you get on with your dinner. I just thought you should know. Yes, thank you. You can go out this way. Why are you so upset about it? It's not that, it's just it's so sad seeing you living like this, lonely and living in a garage. It breaks my heart. But I've never been more happy in all my life. Yeah, I just had a few questions for you with regards to antibiotics. It said three times a day, but it's only twice a day, I was just wondering... Oh, okay, yes. Yes, they've arrived, they arrived at lunchtime today. Just hold on a sec. Hi there, are you all right? Can I help you? I'm here to see Duncan Miller. Oh, official visiting hours finished at 4:30. Are you family? No, but we lived together for 50 years. I'll call you back. Come round. Duncan. Liebe. Thank you. You look beautiful. Are you in pain? No, I feel good, they're pumping me full of morphine. That's good. Would you come over here and sit beside me and hold my hand? I'm not here to come back to you. You should know, I haven't come here for that. Well if you've come to speak your mind, you better not hold your tongue for very long. I saw you at the markets. I've spoke to my lawyer, made sure that the house and everything goes to you in your name, you can move in whenever you like. I won't be going back. I don't care about the house. Then sell it, use the money, it doesn't matter. It's all yours now. And I left the $5s under our bed. But that was for your recording. That was for your dreams, not mine. My only dream was for you to be happy. I'm sorry, Liebe, for so much that I did, I wasn't very good to you. Hello. Hey. Who are you? I'm Jordan, I'm the filmmaker. I'll be recording your voice. This is Jordan, he's going to record you singing. I'm using a Rode NTG3 mic. It's really professional. It's great for the human voice. It was actually made by an Australian company. I can't play piano anymore. My arms, they won't work properly. Not even after your rest? The fingers, I just can't do it. My brother can play the keyboard. He's great, he can play anything. Oh, will he be happy to come here? How much are you paying him? It's fine, give it to me later. I'd better go find him. Thank you. How are you feeling? Tired. You ready? Is he ready? You ready? How about that? That sounds good, Harry. Liebe! All my life I was trying to find my audience, it's only now I realized my audience was you. I love you, Liebe. Hello. I'm here to see Liebe. Liebe. The video's online, it's just gone viral. Again! It's got over a million hits. My computer outside, come see. What's happening? We're watching a video. I'll put in the wi-fi first.
