(dramatic suspenseful music) (ominous music) (dramatic suspenseful music) (engines puttering) Dr. Cesar Sepulveda, nuclear physicist. (engine puttering) (door slams) (footsteps tapping) - My dearest colleagues, I took the liberty of holding this meeting here at my house to inform you all, distinguished members of the Metaphysic Research Society, about the work of esteemed friend of mine, known to all of you for his scientific work, as well as having dedicated his whole life while hiding his identity to fight effectively against crime. Let me introduce you to Santo. - Gentlemen, after (speaking in foreign language), which was started by me, I have come to the conclusion that's it's possible to return someone, by the composition of matter, to a previous existence. - Are you saying that if I were to dematerialize, I could live in a bygone time, a supposed life that I have already lived before? - Exactly, Doctor, and with that we can discover the origins of many millennial cultures, cities, archeological monuments, treasures and much more. - Can you explain to us the experiment? - With pleasure, Doctor. Would you kindly follow me? Come in. (machines beeping) This is my mechanical invention. It's actually a time machine. The experiments consist in making the chosen subject by the decomposition of its atoms to be projected in time and space to a previous life. - Have you tested the experiment? - No. - Then it's just a theory like any other. - A theory that can be demonstrated. All the research I have done led me to be sure of success. - If you're so sure, Santo, why haven't you tried it? - Well because I haven't found a willing test subject. In this case, the ideal subject will be of the female gender for biological reasons. But the biggest obstacle is always the fear of the unknown. - And that's natural. I will decline myself such honor because this experiment could be potentially dangerous, right? - Yes, it could be dangerous for the test subject's personal life to experience and relive a past life. - Yet you have no problem exposing this theory, right? (scientists laugh) (machines beeping) - I know that what happened today must be a great disappointment for you. - Exactly, Doctor, I trust that I will find help, but rather it was the opposite, a complete disaster. - Don't say that. You haven't failed, you will succeed. - Cognac? - I prefer coffee. - Bring him a cup of coffee, please. - With pleasure, sir. - This way, gorgeous. (laughs) (Barbara laughs) - Your niece wants to say goodnight to you, sir. - I'm going to sleep, goodnight, Uncle. - Goodnight, honey. - Goodnight, Luisa. Goodnight, everybody. - Sleep well. - Sweet dreams, dear. - I appreciate that you brought Paquita to live with you. - She's such a sweet little girl. - I remember she was very young when her parents were killed by the mob. You made an oath to take care of her. - Poor thing, but your love has made her very happy. I'm sure that you will be an excellent mother for Paquita. - I really hope so. - Once I prove my experiment is correct, we will think about our future. - Listen, Santo, you know that we scientists are not convinced by simple, unproven theories, we must have proof. - Proof, proof, that's what I wish to show you, but where is the person that will help me to prove that I am right? - No, no, don't look at me. I'm your friend, but I ain't got the guts for that. (ominous music) (shoes tapping) - Santo, I have given you my hospitality and helped you conduct your experiments here in my home. It's because of the great admiration I have for you. My greatest satisfaction would be your triumph. If you desire it, I can be your test subject. - No, Professor, but thank you. At your age this experiment will be twice as risky. Something might go wrong and unfortunately it may be fatal for you. - Then what kind of test subject do you need to find? - A young and healthy woman. Ideally a woman because they have four times more resistance than men and it would be easier to radiate her cells for a longer time. - To transfer her to a previous life? - Yes and to endure the tremendous shock of returning to her present life. - You mean that when the subject returns to this time she would still remember the previous one she had? - Exactly, Doctor, and that could produce a mental injury to the person. - Santo, could I be the one? - What are you saying? - Luisa. - Could I be your test subject? - No. (sighs) - You have never lied to me, answer me. - What do you want me to say? I don't know? - But nobody knows better than you. - Well, yes, yes, it could work, but you are the last person I would try it on. - Buy why? - Haven't heard that experiment is very dangerous? - I am as invested as you are in finding the truth. Let me help you. (dramatic music) - Be careful it doesn't go over 160, it could be dangerous. Are you ready, Professor? - I'm ready. Coramine, adrenaline, Peradoxime and sulfates. (machines beeping) - Ready? - Ready. (machine screeches) (mysterious music) (dramatic music) (gasps) - Well, looking at the kind of furniture, she seems to be at the end of the last century. - Indeed. And by her behavior, she seems to be sick. (hooves clopping) (crickets chirping) (hand raps) - I am Professor Van Roth. - Do come in, milord is waiting. - My friend, Van Roth. - Professor Soler. I don't know how to repay you. - Even if it was another patient instead of your daughter, I would have come. I will never be able to forget the favor you once did for me. - Nevermind that, cognac? - Oh, thank you, thank you. Thank you. (glasses clink) - Van Roth, I'm extremely worried. As I told you in my letter, my daughter has the same symptoms that took the life of her friend, Mara, and many other girls from this town. - Hmm, tell me about Mara. - She was visiting us here when she fell sick. She got weaker, her health diminished day by day. - And have you given her any transfusions? - Um, yes, three. - Did they work? - Somewhat. Every time she got them, but then the next morning she became weak and pale again. 10 days ago we found her in a stupor from which she could never recover and died. - Hmm, and tell me the other symptoms. - None, just the scars on her throat. - Those scars are exactly the reason I am here. And how were they? - Two little white spots with a red spot in the middle. (bat squeaks) (wings flap) - What's that? - It looks like a bat. (suspenseful music) (bat squeaking) What kind of herb is that? It made the animal flee. - Mistletoe. It's a herb that grows in Transylvania. Vampires can't stand the smell. (shoes tapping) - My dear child. This is my dearest friend, Professor Van Roth. - Maybe you don't remember old Professor Van Roth, but I did meet you when you were a child. Now you have become a beautiful and graceful woman, but a little pale, maybe. Soon enough, my dear, your cheeks will recover their rosy color. (laughs) May I? Please tell me the first symptom you felt of this disease, was the lack of energy? - Two nights after the death of poor Mara, I had this horrible nightmare. - Uh-huh, okay, okay, tell me about it. - I remember that dogs began barking before I slept and a thick fog seemed to engulf my room. The next morning I woke up really sad and feeling weak. - Have you had any more dreams like that? - It seems like every night that fog comes to me. I see a pale face with blood-red eyes. - We gave her two transfusions and every single time she got a little better. - And how long since those marks appeared on your neck? - Since that morning. - Uh, please, let me see. - No, no. - I beg you to allow me to see them. It will be quick, please. (ominous music) - Good evening, Count. - Gentlemen. Mademoiselle, it seems the night you've gotten better. - Indeed, Count, especially now that this old friend of my father has come to heal me. - Count Alucard, this is Professor Van Roth. - A distinguished man of science whose name is known worldwide. But am I interrupting something? - No, quite the opposite, Count. We are delighted by your visit. - It's always a pleasure to see you. I love it when you come to visit. - It will be better if you went upstairs to rest while I continue talking to your father. - Thank you, the maid will escort me. If you excuse me. (ominous music) - Monsieur Count, just like me, is a foreigner in this country, am I right? And you plan to stay here a long time, Count? - That is my intention, my friend. - I hope you won't regret having acquired that old and ruined mansion. - It is not ruined, it had a lot of dust. In my country we're used to that. But you must be eager to talk to this famous scientist. With your permission, I'll be on my way, but I will come back to know if I can be helpful, gentlemen. - The count is really kind, but let's talk about my daughter. - Fine. No doubt you have heard of the legends of Central Europe that talk about vampires? - Can you be talking about those ghosts that suck the blood out of the living? - Maybe you call them ghosts, I prefer to call them the undead. Vampires attack the neck and leave behind two marks with a red spot in the middle. - Like the ones Luisa has? - Indeed. - Mara had them, too. - And I can assure you that the girls who have disappeared have had them as well. (woman hisses) (mysterious music) (woman moans) - King and Lord of Darkness, here are two new priestesses who will join your infernal court, the Legion of the Living Dead. (suspenseful music) (somber music) (hisses) (Luisa moans) - Luisa lived in the same time as a vampire, Count Alucard. - But a vampire in America, please don't pull my leg, sir. - I'm sure Professor Van Roth can solve the mystery. (hand pounds) (door rattles) - I hope you didn't leave Miss Luisa alone? - No, sir, she is with her father. - How is she doing? - She is a bit nervous, sir. She learned from the newspaper about the beautiful woman in white who, at dusk, offers sweets to children and takes them to a secluded place where she bites their throat. (paper rustles) - Please, you must call Professor Soler now, but do not leave Miss Luisa alone, no matter what. - Yes, sir. (suspenseful music) - That vampire is Dracula. - Professor Van Roth found out. - Look, look. - Good evening. - (gasps) My, God. I didn't hear you come in, Count. - Well I am quite light on my feet. - How strange, this mirror reflects everything except you. - Bastard! (glass clatters) Forgive me, I do not like mirrors. They are but toys of human vanity. And how is our beautiful patient? - The prognosis is quite the challenging one, my count. - I was afraid of that. - Would you like to know what I'm going to treat my patient with? - Everything that has to do with Miss Luisa is of great interest to me. (overcoat rustles) (dramatic music) (Van Roth gasps) (Dracula gasps) (suspenseful music) - It's just a simple scratch, my count. I'm going to show you the medicine that I'm going to give Miss Luisa. (Dracula gasps) Don't you like the smell? (Dracula growls) (Dracula hisses) (ominous music) (bat squeaks) My God. - Van Roth, are you okay? Is everything all right? - (speaking in foreign language), no, no. Count Alucard was here. He was going to kill me. - What, it can't be. - He is the vampire. I've got all the evidence. Look, I found out he got here by boat. He brought with him six large boxes that looked like coffins filled with soil. - A vampire has to hide and rest during the day. The same soil in which it was buried when he died. But why would he bring six coffins with him? - I don't know? I don't know, but we must find them and then we can destroy this beast. - Have you read today's news from the newspaper? - About the mysterious woman who, after giving sweets to children, attacks them? - I think the woman in white is Mara. - Mara? But she's dead, Luisa. - She has joined the master. - My God. - Luisa, I won't ask you how you know all of this, but I promise you I will save the soul of your friend with the aid of God. - Then you will be able to save mine, too? - Yours, too, I promise you. Starting now, the maid will sleep in your chambers. We will remain vigilant here until the light of the new day comes. I made this mistletoe necklace just for you, Luisa. As long as you wear it, it shall protect you. Promise me, you will never take it off. - I promise. (ominous music) (maid gasps) - Quiet. (hisses) (mysterious music) - This is where Mara is buried. - Hurry up, the sunset is about to come. (gate rattles) (hinges squeak) (shoes tapping) (suspenseful music) (hinges creak) (mysterious music) (hammer pounds) (Mara screams) (suspenseful music) (necklace clatters) (Dracula hisses) (dramatic music) (door creaks) - You do not have to feel guilty, Professor. We have fulfilled our duty by saving the soul of poor Mara. - But I must say it has been a very painful task. - Let us see how your daughter is doing. (dramatic music) - Luisa is not here. Lupe, where is Luisa? - She is under a hypnotic trance. Come on, you will wake up at the count of three. One, two, three. (hand claps) Wake up. Lupe, where is Luisa? - I don't know, sir, the only thing I remember is sleeping on this divan. - (gasps) Look, the vampire took her. We have to act quickly. - Well how can we find his hideout? - This afternoon I asked a shepherd to get a wolf dog, this animal can track a vampire assassins. Let's pray to God he found it. (dog howls) (ominous music) - I have chosen you as my wife for all eternity. (dog howls) (bat squeaks) - (gasps) Where is she going with the... - What's a va-va? - Vampire. - Stop spitting on me. Shut up off it, they're going to his secret lair. (bat squeaks) (ominous music) - Oh, goodness gracious, could all those little jewels be real? - Shh. - In addition to giving you eternal life, I will share with you my enormous wealth. This is the fabulous treasure my ancestors left to me. They come from Transylvania in earthen-covered coffins. Only you, my dearest wife, have laid eyes on it. No mortal will ever know that the site where they are now has Serbian characters from my medallion and my ring. Now we must rest. Our enemy, the sunlight, will soon come out and if it surprises us its effects would be deadly. We will go to my shelter, found in a distant graveyard. My bite has imbued you with my essence. Now you are part of the undead and you can fly. Follow me. (ominous music) (bats squeak) (gate creaks) (suspenseful music) (door creaks) (dramatic music) This will be your deathbed. Come, the dawn is upon us. We must take refuge in the kingdom of darkness. Get in. (lid creaks) (shoes shuffling) (suspenseful music) (dog whines) (lantern creaks) - We found him, Professor. (suspenseful music) (hammer pounds) (Dracula hisses) - (gasps) Luisa. Luisa. - It's no use, Professor, now she's dead. - What are you gonna do to my daughter? - He's gonna kill her. - If he kills her, I won't be able to bring her back to this side. Hurry, we have to bring her back. (machine beeps) - Unfortunately, there is no hope left in this life for Luisa for the vampire bit her three times. (machines beep) (mysterious music) - Santo, there's no pulse. There's a face. - That doesn't matter now. Give me Coramine, Professor. - Here you go. - She has no pulse, she's dying. - (gasps) Oh, God. (gasps) - What's the matter? - I don't know? I'm feeling dizzy. This is too much pressure for me, I. (sighs) (dramatic music) - That was an awful experience. - Calm down, it's already over. Get some rest. - How's she doing? - She's nervous, but the painkiller took effect. She will be fine. She's quite fearless. How about Perico? - I left him resting in the upstairs room. He really doesn't seem to have the stomach for it. - What do you think of this, Professor? - That we are facing something positively amazing that may lead to investigations never done before, the invention of the century. - Wait a minute, Professor, during the experiment we forgot something important. Who was that man with the black mask who entered the lab? (Atlas grunts) (weights clang) - Hello, Father. - Atlas, I have witnessed an incredible experiment, something so amazing you wouldn't believe it no matter what. - I believe everything you say, Father. - I will tell you everything later. Come with me, we have to round up our men. (speaker buzzes) - It's the boss. - Listen carefully. From now all on you will be watching Dr. Sepulveda's place. I want you tap his phone and to install cameras. This job will bring us great riches. And remember, I won't tolerate any guns, the life of Santo and his friends must be sacred to you all. Over and out. - Hey, Andy, what called the boss want? - I don't know, Raton? It must be something big, as always. - It's just that I don't really like Santo is involved. - You afraid of him? - Afraid, no, I'm terrified. - You coward. - Professor, the proof we need is in the vampire's coffin. - No, you don't know what you're saying. Please, let the undead sleep in peace. - Can't you see my only interest is scientific? Now that I am about to prove my theory you will leave me alone? We need your help. Only you, who walked the road in another time and place can take us there. (mysterious music) (engine hums) - Santo, I only hope we don't regret what can happen tonight. - Only with your help will we be able to solve this mystery. - The answer could be horrible, Santo. - Get out. - No. - Are you afraid? - Yes, very afraid. - Aren't you a man? - I'm a little mouse. - Oh, come on. - We must be really careful now or the graveyard keeper could find out what we're doing. - Move it, wimp. (Perico whimpers) (suspenseful music) (ominous music) - Oh, Mama. (sobs) - What's wrong? - There, there standing was the man with the mask. - Don't be a liar, Perico, there's no one there. - I swear on my sons, I saw the man standing there. - You don't have any sons. - Well the ones I will have. Please, Santo, something terrible... - Be quiet, Perico. - Good, now the important thing is for Luisa to remember which crypt lead us to the vampire's lair. Can you do it? - I will try. - We should go and come back tomorrow... - I said be quiet, Perico. Let's go. - Light the way, please. (suspenseful music) - This is the one. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Perico, go get the shovels and pick axes from the car. - The sho-shos? - (sighs) The shovels and the pick axes. - All by myself? - Sure, go. - Luisa, come with me. - Go, stop fooling around. - But over there is the man with the mask. - Run, (speaking in foreign language), don't walk. (Perico sobs) (suspenseful music) (tools rattle) (ominous music) (Perico gasps) (Perico shrieks) - Next time send someone else, I won't do it again, ever again. - Now what's the problem? - I know you won't believe me, but over there I saw the man with the mask. - Again? - I'm just saying, if I hadn't brought my belt, my pants would have fallen off. We are going inside? - Yeah, little baby. - No, I better stay out here and watch the lock for you so nobody steals it because it's ancient, therefore it's priceless, right? - No, you're coming with us. - You won't abuse the fact that I'm skinny? - Look, so you can feel safer, take this whistle. If you're in danger, just whistle and we will come to help you. (suspenseful music) (feet shuffling) - I seem to remember there was a door here. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Give a light. (door creaks) (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (crickets chirping) (suspenseful music) (shoes tapping) (somber music) (suspenseful music) (tools clanging) (Perico murmurs) (rocks crunching) - What's going on? - You heard it? What was that noise? (suspenseful music) Turn off the light, Professor. (Perico whimpers) (shoes stomping) (dramatic music) (Luisa screams) (Father grunts) (Santo groans) (feet shuffling) (men panting) (men grunting) (Perico whimpers) - Quick, let's go. (Santo groans) - Santo, are you okay? - Are you hurt? - No, I'm okay, and you? - Better than ever. - Congratulations, Perico, you are one tough gangster. - That's me, brave as a lion when needed. I even forgot about the whistle. - That's the spirit, Perico. (Luisa laughs) - What's wrong with you? (whistle blares) - Swallowed (whistle blares) the whistle. - What now, what were you thinking? - It was all (whistle blares) you're fault. (whistle blares) Those pats. (whistle blares) - Man you're clumsy. - And now (whistle blares) I can't. (whistle blares) - Just leave it to me. (whistle blares) - No, no. Just leave him alone. (laughs) (whistle blares) - Well now we're certain that the black-hooded man is on to us because of our discoveries in this place. - Most certainly. - Hmm. - Good, let's keep going then. (henchmen panting) - We'll meet at the lair, keep going. - But, boss, we can get them if you just let us use our guns. - No, out of the question. We know what we are looking for, from now on we will wait for Santo to find the rest. (doors slam) (engines roar) (suspenseful music) - Now we will know the truth. - Count Dracula, the King of Vampires. What are you doing, Perico? - He looks like my uncle. - Don't be stupid, get up. - No, Santo, don't do it. Please, let's just go. (chain rattles) (suspenseful music) - Move it, Perico. - He looks just like my uncle. - (sighs) It's a relief to leave this place. Let's just go, I'm afraid for what could happen next. - Don't worry, Luisa, we are done here. - You're wrong, this is the beginning of a chain of misfortunes to come. - I will close the gate. (gate creaks) (ominous music) Now I will work on translating the Serbian words inscribed on this medallion, which mark the exact location of the vampire's treasure. - You are missing one important thing, Santo. With the excitement of our discovery we forgot the ring. - (sighs) That's true, Doctor. - The two objects complement each other. Without the ring, we won't be able to translate these words. - How could I forget? I will go back for the ring. - Santo, I beg of you, forget about all of this and return the medallion to its place. - Beg your pardon? - Oh, I can't help it. I've had the feeling something horrible would happen, ever since the day we entered that crypt. I'm scared, Santo. We shouldn't have touched those objects. People like us should never play with things we don't understand. - However, I must continue for two reasons, to prove to those scientists who mocked me that my theory was right and to find a vampire's famous treasure, which will help the people in need. (suspenseful music) (lid creaks) - Good morning. - Good morning. (Luisa laughs) (mower rattles) - You called us? - I decided that tonight we would go for the vampire's ring. - Who? - You, Dr. Sepulveda and me. - Oh, no, no. You two go because I will only return to the cemetery once I'm dead. You two better go and I will stay here and take care of the girl and the house, okay? - Oh, no, sir, you'll come with us, understood? - Well, if you put it that way then. - All right, we will invent an excuse for Luisa and then go to the cemetery at midnight. (feet shuffling) (suspenseful music) (lid creaks) The ring is missing. - The only person who followed us here was the man with the black hood. - I'm sure he must have taken it. - Congrats, you're a genius. - Idiot. (suspenseful music) - Oh, wait for me. (crickets chirping) (ominous music) (men grunting) - Freeze, don't move, freeze. Santo, don't make me kill you. Santo, I have a proposal for you. You have the necklace and I the vampire ring. Why don't we work as a team and decipher those Serbian words? - And after that? - We share the treasure equally. Do we have a deal? - No way, sir. You will use that fortune for evil deeds. - That's your final decision? - Yes. - Santo, I spared your life because you were of use to me, but since you won't cooperate, your lives are no longer necessary. - Wait a minute. If you kill us all you won't get the necklace and the medallion. Besides, we are also interested in owning that ring. I can tell you that this young man is a formidable wrestler. How about we arrange a match with Santo and the winner will be able to keep the two objects? - That's an excellent idea. Are you up to it, son? Fine, the match will take place 15 days from today in a crowded arena. - Agreed. - Good, at the end of the match the two objects shall be delivered to the winner. Move out! - Gee, that was a close one, right? - (laughs) Please forgive me, Santo, that was the only idea I had to save ourselves. - And it was good, Doctor, but how can we be sure that this guy won't fight dirty and that he will keep his word? - That man is very cunning. We will have to level the playing field. We will devise a plan and at the end of the match, we will catch him. - (laughs) Don't worry about it. No matter what, the treasure will be ours. - Check this out, the perfect throw is this way. (Perico groans) See? Now don't pull on his hair because that will be an illegal move in the ring. So you lift him up this way. (body thuds) (Perico grunts) If he doesn't get up, don't try to pull on his ears, he could pass out from the pain. You just pick him up again. (body thuds) (Perico whimpers) See how easy it is? - It was very kind of you to help me train. Let's go to my dressing room, I need to talk to you privately. - Okay. (Perico grunts) (men laugh) (Perico groans) - What's so funny? You should have seen me fighting the other night. (men laugh) (Perico groans) (men shout) - What is it, Santo? - Look, I guess I've been pulled into a dangerous situation and I may be in need of your help one day. - You can count on me unconditionally and also with all your wrestling friends. - Here, have this communication watch with you at all times. If one day I'm in danger and wish to speak with you, I will do so using this watch. - All right. - Tonight, sensational wrestling match, Santo versus Atlas. (people murmuring) (audience cheering) (audience applauding) (audience shouting) - Yeah, keep screaming. (bell beeps) (men grunt) (bodies thud) (hand slams) (men grunt) (bodies thuds) (Santo grunts) (body thuds) (hand slaps) (Santo groans) (body thuds) (hand slams) (audience shouts) (bell beeps) (men grunt) (hand slams) (hand slams) (body thuds) (hand slams) (Atlas grunts) (hand slaps) (body thuds) (Atlas groans) (hand slams) (audience applauding) (alarm beeps) (men grunt) (Atlas groans) (body thuds) (hand slams) (Santo grunts) (hand slaps) (body thuds) (Atlas groans) (body thuds) (hand slams) (Atlas shouts) (Santo grunts) (audience shouts) (Atlas groans) (audience cheers) - Come in. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Congratulations, you are an extraordinary wrestler. It isn't easy to defeat my son fairly, but you did it. Here's what was agreed. I think there's nothing more to add. If you excuse me. - Wait. I must tell you, I'm going to hand you over to the authorities. I haven't done it yet because of our deal and I am a man of my word. - I expect no less from a man like you. Good night. Before taking a step, I always take precautions. Look, I made an exact copy of the ring and soon we will have the necklace, too. (laughs) Those poor idiots, they think they already beat us and they don't see the terrible plan I have prepared for them. (Luisa sighs) - What's wrong, Luisa? I'm waiting for you to go to the garden. - I was just going to go with you, Paquita. - What a pretty necklace, is it yours? - No, it belongs to Uncle Santo. - Can I play with it? - No, sweetheart, children shouldn't play with this. - I like it. - Yes, it's beautiful in appearance, but you shouldn't touch it. - Why? - Because it was made by very bad people. (necklace clatters) - We will pull out the stake from him. He will return to life and kill the ones who have his necklace and ring, Santo and his friends. Now rip out that stake. - Me, boss? - Yes, you, aren't you a brave man? - No, boss. - Coward, just go. (Dracula groans) Move out. (ominous music) (Paquita moans) (drum pounds) (pitcher clatters) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (henchmen grunt) (gun bangs) (bat squeaks) (dramatic music) (Dracula hisses) (ominous music) (Luisa gasps) - Look into my eyes, Luisa. You are under my power. Yes Master Get dressed and follow me. (suspenseful music) (door rattles) (mysterious music) - You idiots. Didn't I tell you to be alert and that if you saw the vampire to run immediately? - Got it, boss. But boss, we can get them if you just let us use our guns. - You fool, the bullet that can destroy a vampire hasn't been invented yet. Let's go to see what happened. Let's hope to find Santo and his friends dead by now. If so, I know how to exterminate the vampire to reclaim the objects. With them I will fly to Transylvania to have someone translate the Serbian words, then the treasure will be ours. Now move it. (henchman gasps) (ominous music) (Jose groans) (Jose gasps) (dramatic music) (feet shuffling) (hand pounds) (hand pounds) (Jose gasps) - Jose, Jose, what happened to you? - Boss, a man, (gasps) a man with the strange clothes, (gasps) wearing a medallion. He took Miss Lucy away. - Professor, Perico! Santo here calling X. Santo here calling X, listen to my instructions. (engine roars) - Surely they have the necklace and the ring. Come, we have to catch them. (engine roars) Black-hooded man calling, black-hooded man calling. (phone beeps) - Andy speaking. - Andy, catch up with me. We must stop Santo's car. - Got it, boss, over. (engine roars) (engines roar) - After them. (sirens blare) (tires screeching) (dramatic music) (men grunt) (hands slam) (Santo grunts) (men groan) (tires screech) (siren blares) (body thuds) (body thuds) (Santo groans) (guns bang) - Freeze, everyone. - Nobody move. (men grunting) - Don't move. - Santo, are you all right? (suspenseful music) Now we will find out who is the black-hooded man. (dramatic music) Dr. Kur. - Officers, this man belongs to you. We will go later to the police headquarters to file the indictment against him. Come on, we already wasted a lot of time. - Come on, move, let's go. - Let me see, let me see. - No, no, Perico, it's too late. We will seek the blood of mortals which keeps us alive. (growls) You have arrived at the right moment to watch the initiation of the undead, of the one who will be my wife. After that, your punishment will be death for the audacity of desecrating my refuge. - Now what are we going to do? - Just wait, the night is almost over. - Mara. (ominous music) - He is going to kill her. - Now! (explosion booms) (priestesses scream) - Sunlight, it's that damned sunlight. (screams) (rocks pounding) Why have you done this? (shouts) - Oh that was really close. - I still don't understand what happened, this is a miracle. - No miracles here, Doctor. It was all part of my plan. - Hello, Santo, everything okay? - Perfect timing. - Who are they, Santo? - My fellow wrestlers. I gave X instructions to put a charge of dynamite and to detonate it when I gave him the signal using my communication watch. The rest is history. - Well apart from you I don't see anyone else. Where is the danger you told me about? - There. - What's that? - A vampire. - What? - A human vampire and the others are remains of vampire women. - Ah, so that's it. Take two aspirins and please see me in the morning. Let's go, boys. - It seems they didn't believe me. - Seeing is believing, right? - I'm glad this is all over finally. - You were right, my dear Luisa. Now I understand what you meant to say when you said humans should never, ever enter the world of the unknown. - Let's go. (mysterious music) (dramatic music)
