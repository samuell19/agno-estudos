Are you trembling? But that is how... One person loves another. But that is how... One person punishes another. Those who have forgotten to fear god... They are doomed to become angels of the night. Are you still trembling? But why? Why? Multinvestigations? That makes sense. I was given direct orders from the Global Bureau of Investigations head himself... ...to have as part of his special ops team. I guess he's under a lot of pressure... ...with all the unrest that's propping up as we near the end of the century. It's been three years since my boss... Your father and his family was taken hostage... ...by that group of sickos and later killed. Yet you managed to survive solely because you were in a Karate Tournament overseas at the time. I wanted to make up to my family... ...for being the only one left alive... ...so I worked hard in the US. Which is good... ...since you'll now have the chance to use the skills you learned both in the FBl... ...and as a Women's World Champion Karate master. "When you're on the top of the world, you can't be surprised by anything that happens", right? Top of the world? Remember when we used to work together was "The Dragon and The Flower?" This just means that we're back in business. I forgot to mention, but the second person Multinvestigations requests was me. I wasn't on the list, so I put myself on it. The Flower and The Dragon... I was inexperienced back then, but you were always covering for me. I don't think you have any reason to refuse. Forceful as always. Just like when you asked me to sleep together for the first time. That's all in the past. But, why? Why are we LLPW? Lovely Ladies Pro Wrestling? You'll find out soon enough. Harder! Harder! Move your hips more! Shorten the movements! Speed up a bit! Come on, damn it! Harder! Harder! Give it your best! Hey, Boss, welcome back. Yo. Boss? Oh, let me introduce you two. This is Kazama Ryumi, the manager here. This is our new student, Shirogane Jun. New student? What is this? Nice to meet you. The girl shadow boxing over there is Kandori Shinobu. Y'know, I only waited this long... ...because you told me that you had a great athlete coming back from America... Right, the entrance exam, right? No prob. Shirogane, do you have any experience with wrestling? None. What about other sports? I dabbled a bit in Karate. You better not lose. I know. Becoming Pro isn't easy you know. Go back to America. Break! The Whipping Hole To our reunion. I'm still amazed. I didn't think you'd fare so well. The main weak points of Karate is... ...when they're close and when you're down on the ground. That's why I started learning grappling techniques. I see. Whenever I think about my parents... I couldn't bring enough punishment unto myself. I'm surprised myself, y'know. The LLPW Bus, the Dojo... ...with you as the boss! You think so? I'm friendly with Kazama.... So when I told her about a returning prodigy, she was ecstatic. Still, is there a reason why I have to be a pro wrestler? It has to do with the season tour. The season tour? Yep. The Pro Wrestler Season Tour... Every season we go from Hokkaido all the way down to Kyushu and Okinawa... ...and we spend about 1/2 the time on the road. We won't raise any suspicions no matter where we pop up. So it's camouflage? What? You thought it was a part-time job? You always were fighting with your boss. C'mon, your debut bout and your first mission's coming up. When are we leaving? Tomorrow morning. See? This is what I mean when I say you're a slave driver. You see, "A woman's stamina is its most vibrant in her youth." "It has both unlimited power and sensuality" What's that? It's a quote from Nashuu Ootori, a very famous racketeer. Even if we do manage to catch her... ...it's likely that the mass media will cover up the truth... ...or else the entire Japanese underworld will in a panic. That's big picture we're looking at. ln other words, we can't lay a finger on her. Caio! My city... my loving subjects. Good morning. Good morning. It's me. Yeah. Sheesh... my stupid son again. Get him back here. No matter what. Got it? Good. Jeez... This looks good! Yes? It's me. The Whipping Hole? Okay... ...Multinvestigations? Toodori? Toodori? Boss! Boss! Maa-kun? Maa-kun, Mistress Ootori wants to have lunch with you. Again? I'm already booked for this afternoon and tonight. Could you tell her maybe next time? Hey! Say it one more time. Maa-kun. ln the blue corner... Rio the Shield and Silver Jun! Here they come now! ln the opposite corner, Harley Saint and the Crimson Shaw. Here they come now! Step back! I told you to step back! The match will be compromised of 1 45-minute round. ln the Blue corner is the new queen of wrestling, Silver Jun! This tag-team match with Rio the Shield will be Silver Jun's debut match. Exactly what kind of fighter is Silver Jun? The only thing I know is that she has big eyes. I see... ...The Crimson Shaw! ...at 147 pounds, Harley Saint! We'll now have LLPW's mascot Ai-chan present Silver Jun with a bouquet of flowers. Congratulations on your debut, Jun! Thanks. Hey ref! Take the count! Good work... ...Maa-kun. Excuse me. I'm not going anywhere today. I'm heading straight home. Toodori. If you're not going anywhere, then I guess that means that you don't have any plans. Could you come with us? What? Lady Nancy is waiting. This way. Allow me to take your coat. This way. This way. Go on ahead. Ciao. - What!? I wanted to see you. What's wrong? You're look so surprised. Aren't you thirsty? I know you are. I made it just for you. Drink it. I said now! Now drink. Did it taste good? Delicious. Why don't we play some more? You liked being spanked, don't you? You can take some more, right? Why do you have be so big? Everyone has a guest spot on TVthis afternoon. We have another match the day after. A tight schedule indeed. Hello? Nancy? It's me, Sasagi. Good afternoon, miss. You're quite a beaut. Raise your hands. A physical examination is in order. It's alright. Can't you do this in some other way? Lady Nancy is busy at the moment. Why don't we play with it until she gets free? Play with what? Your pussy. What is that sound? Who cares? I bet they killed some stray dog. My boys are meaner than they look. Yes... Take a walk. You're usually sitting in some high ranking executive seat. I can't believe you turned into a total masochist after just one experience. Yet at the same time, you don't want others to see you like this so you call me to your home! Although your face does piss me off... Up. You're not that bad... Very well... I shall reward you. Thank you, mistress. Mistress... I want... Is this it? Where do you want it? My back. Where on your back? Where? Where? My ass! This is where our play ends. Let's see how bad I can rip your rectum. Are you ready? You're a fuckin' dog! How dare you get on the mattress! Who the fuck are you? The last blade of justice in the 20th century. Silver Mace. I see... So you're the one... ...that Multinvestigations sent. I was wondering when you'd show up. Are you surprised? You may be a Global Investigational Organization, but I have my own connections. Enough to keep tabs on your movements! Your own connections? Give it up, "mistress". What are you doing!? Let me go! Let me go! Hey! Hold it right there! Step back. Let go of me! You fucking bitch! I'll kill you! I'll fucking kill you! Take her... Take her to the special room! Take her to the special room right now! Raise your hands and walk this way. You better not try anything funny. Move. Hurry up! I can't believe they're playing around with shit like this. I'm going to have a couple of words with them later. C'mon, hurry up! This way! Come on! What's a girl from Multinvestigations doing without any weapons? What are you after her? A list of our clients? A slave? Toys? Wanna see misery? It'll be better for you to confess now. You see, in this room... A muscular model... a proud actress... I've made all sorts of celebrities into slaves of this pain. So you don't have to tell me. I'll train you so that you can't live with any secrets from me. Soon you'll be just another fuckin' cunt. Your marshmallow-like ass and everything will be controlled by your mistress. Yes? Ah, Boss Otsudayumino. Oh, you want a session now?. Sure, I'll go. Let's see... Why don't you clean your ass and wait for me? Having a Yakuza Boss for a slave complicates things quite a bit. I'll take good care of you once I come back, so just sit tight until then. Got it? Let's go. Remember to go back to training after you finish running! All right. Louder! What's wrong with you girls, try harder! All right! Where's Jun? Never came back. Sucks to be the newbie, eh? Hey, Miss. What did you eat to get your titties to be that big? Holy shit, they're big! Maa-kun's calling for you. Sorry for our introduction yesterday. I never had a girl see my ass so quickly. Do I get any hush money out of this? Having you come there yesterday screwed up my relations with her. And so...I was hoping to give you a little present. Is that the present? Sorry, but die for me. Don't worry. We'll clean up any bits of your brain that spill out. But as for the body... ...that will be... I strongly advise against this. I don't want some idiot like to you tell me what to do. Don't steal my prey from me. What? What the...!? What...! Who are you? You're... So you're still alive. Unfortunately for you. But I put so many locks on you. Fighting isn't the only thing I'm good at. I'm also an escape-artist. I'm surprised that you actually tied yourself up like that. Or maybe you just like to play with yourself? Don't come near me. If you're horny... ...I can help you get off. It's payback time. Feel free! You're shaking. You're wondering if it's right for humans to judge other humans. That's fine. If you lose your fear of god, you're nothing more than a machine. The thing that gets to me the most the fact that... ...we didn't the list or anything out of all this. Does such a thing even exist? You're shaking... ...it's all because of Dark lnsect Hole got there first. Dark lnsect Hole? It's a little too convenient that you finish your first assignment on your birthday. There we go... Happy Birthday. Thanks. I want you to fuck me. Who are you? Open it. This is Nancy's customer list. ...and film. I see you like what you see. My job is kill you. ...not to guard Nancy. She even called in a gang to help her without my permission. Why did you save me? If you let him kill me right there... I wouldn't have been able to react and the risk to you would've been small. Isn't that how you work? So why? I don't like to let others steal my prey. By the way. I'm Dark lnsect Hole's Agent 004. Just call me Four. The government's main interest here is to gain access to our black market... ...and gain total control of it. Why are you so loyal to a country that has completely given in to the power of money? It'll crumble by itself even if you stay still. Hey, are you trying to pick her up? Sounds good to me. Sounds like fun! Damn, she's looks nice! Hey, could you lend me some money? Lend? Hey, come on. I'll wait for you tomorrow at midnight, by the subway tracks. Harder! Go deeper! Good! C'mon, have a drink. Okay. Orange juice. I went to the same college as your father and we even went to the same karate dojo... Yet he passed away...three years ago. Thank you for your help during those times. You left right afterwards, didn't you? Now here you are, three years afterwards, to get training at that. It sounds a little fishy to me. Sounds to me like you're caught up in something big. I'm sorry, but my profession doesn't allow to tell you. Very well, I won't ask. Sensei, what did you think of my performance? It was pretty good considering you're out of practice... ...which could only mean that you've been using it on the other side of the globe. Yes...to an extent. Karate isn't about the opponent. I'm sure you know this already... But fighting someone requires to you have someone you want to protect... ...given how you might lose your life at any moment. It's only by doing this that you'll be able to fight at your full potential. Thank you. I'll keep those words in mind. Lord... please protect her. Not bad. Well... do you wish to continue? So women like you really do exist. Jun, get on! She's... Translated by Ex-S Woo Subtitled and Mastered by Cannibal King
