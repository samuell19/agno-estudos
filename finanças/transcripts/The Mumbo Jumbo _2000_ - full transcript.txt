(flies buzzing) - Well I uh, I just arrived in town from the mainland and I'm trying to find a- - What's the mainland? - I'm sorry? You know, America actually. - America, he says. - Yeah, yeah, so I'm trying to find- - So what's America, when you say home? - Yeah, is there a manager around? - 1978, he choked on a badger. (laughs) Aye, aye, come over here. There's other folks around these parts talk of similar distant lands. Nothing but the ramblings of mad folk, if you ask me. Folks only live in Sinmouth land. America. (laughs) - Sinmouth, yes, and people live in America, too. - Just Sinmouth, I think you'll find. Now you've had your say. - People live in America. - No they don't. - Yes, yes, they do. - No, they don't. Now that's the end of the matter. You're frightening me crabs. Now, now listen here, lad. There's no such thing as the outside world. There's just Sinmouth. - Oh, god. Ugh. (knocking) - Entrer. - Mister Mayor, Mister Mayor. The Mumbo's arrived. - Have you seen them? - Which one? - Which one of whom? - Which Mumbo? - There's two? - What? - Two Mumbos? - Two Mumbos? - There is? - Is there? - I don't know. - And I don't know either. I'll go out and come in again. - Yes, I think that is best, Chinwag. Oh, sometimes I wonder whether he's human. (knocking) Hors d'oeuvres, uh, entrer. (grumbles) (clock ticking) - It's gone. (soft music) - The world. Sinmouth. - [Thomas] Point taken. - Ah, now, what can I do you for, young sir? - I'm looking for a place to stay. Somewhere cheap, just for a few nights. Can you recommend somewhere? - Crumbledown Farm. Half a mile past the town hall. Just behind the wig farm. - Just behind the wig farm, right. Thanks. Oh yeah, one more thing, mister, uh- - Tipple, Sid Tipple. - Tipple. - Oh, don't mind if I do. - The other locals, Mr. Tipple, what are they like? - They won't bother you much. Not many of them left.

I admit, I was taken in at first. That small, nuclear explosion in Mrs. Tibble's shed. The cyanide capsule in my scotch at the Waygan's Slurry? Sinmouth wanderers staying up- Ah, you didn't reckon with our boys in intelligence, did you? Where's that bally microfilm? And make it quick. I've got a polo match for the royal Windsors at six o'clock. - The fish monger, Mr. Tipple? He said I could rent some accommodation here for a couple of nights. - What? Oh. I see. (chuckles) Sorry. I thought you were someone else. Jolly glad to make your acquaintance, I suppose. Cowpat. Major BJ Cowpat. Call me Barbara. (jazzy music) - Barbara. Okay. (jazzy music) Major? Barbara? - Sir. - Yeah, like I was saying, I'm trying to find Princess Vanilla. Do you have any idea where- - Ooh, Princess Vanilla. (kisses) - Yeah. - Assumed identity, me thinks. Filly working undercover is she a double agent? Mata Hari type? - Nah, nah, nothing like that. She's just someone that I wanna find. - Oh. Missing in action, aye? - Yeah, yeah. That's right. - Hm.

Fertilizer. Not any old fertilizer, mind you. Oh, dear me no. If it's a whopper you're after, it's got to be Bounder's fertilizer. (chuckles) Would you like a squeeze of my plums? - I'm not at all sure they're not genitally modified. - Oh, definitely. (upbeat orchestral music) - You know, you wouldn't be able to eat all of that mush, too. It's because of the fertilizers, aye. - [Woman] Fertilizer. - But it's got to be the right fertilizer, though. - [Woman] Fertilizer. - It's got to be Bounder's fertilizer. For the best gardens this side of Witch's Brook. Ask the wife. - [Woman] Fertilizer. - So, it's all orgasmically grown, then? (laughs) (coughs) - [Woman] Fertilizer. - Oh shut up. - Come on. - No, I... - You like it? I grew it myself. - Father Chinwag. - Oh, Mister Mayor, would you like to see my carrot? - Certainly not. - Ooh, it's a big one. - It's a big one. - Thank you. Oh, you found it. - Found what? - The tome. - No, you found it. - Yes, but you crept into the crypt and collected it. (laughing) What should we do? - Come on, I'll show you, come on. - [Man] Morning mayor. - I've called this emergency meeting of the Sinmouth Fellow Council because after 400 years, missing, believed lost, Father Chinwag has discovered, in the bowels of Sinmouth crypt, this. - [All] Ooh. - Give me the key, Chinwag. - Oh, I'm terribly sorry Mister Mayor. - You ruined the introduction to me speech, you know that, don't you? - I do apologize. - I had them all on tinter hooks. You could see it in their eyes, especially that missing, believed lost bit. Right. Well now, over 400 years. Oh, just chatter out among yourselves. 400 years. Oh, that's a long time, aye? (ethereal music) - Just a dusty old book. (dramatic music) Now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, I have the most successful fertilizer business in the world to run, therefore I bid you good reading. - Mr. Bounder, this is no ordinary book. This is one tome of the great Mumbo Jumbo. - Mumbo Jumbo? (laughs) Even if it were the tome, you're not telling us that you actually believe that you can use it to summon up the Mumbo Jumbo? In this day and age of high yield fertilizer? - Mr. Bounder, Sinmouth is ruined. I mean, since the beautiful Princess Vanilla disappeared, our village, which was once the most, well the 85th most scenic in this area, is, I mean, a blip on the map. (tsks) Now to get on in this life, you have to grab the bull's horn and take action. I have decided to seize the initiative and- - Grab the bull's horn? - And grab the bull's horn. Look, I'll tell you what I did. (soft music) Come in, Mumbo Jumbo! Come in, Mumbo Jumbo! I summon you to restore Sinmouth and all its inhabitants back to its former glory. Ta, very much. (donkey braying) Sure, well that's what I did. - So, how do we spot the Mumbo? - What? - How do we spot the Mumbo? - I'll tell you in a minute. Yes, I think you'll find that future generations will have a lot to thank me for. (Mr. Tibble snoring) Well not that I seek a tradition of course. A small marble and granite statue will suffice. Oh, well, smallish. (laughs) In the middle of the town square, so everyone knows it's me. (Father Chinwag coughs) Oh, yes. (chuckles) Well, well I think you'll agree that that's what Sinmouth needs. (laughs) - Right. - Right. Well now, if we hurry along, we'll be just in time to catch the suspicious looking carrot competition. (knocking) (birds chirping) - Have you seen Princess Vanilla? Are you sure? You're not sure, or are you sure? Now I had a feeling this guy was holding something back. (tense, strange music) It seemed that more than just Princess Vanilla had disappeared. (tense, strange music) (dog barks) (cow moos) (cat meows) Hi. (gasps) Uh, I'm just visiting for a few days and I was wondering when you'd last seen Princess Vanilla? - Five years ago. - Right, really? You see, I'm looking for her. - She disappeared. - Right. Her mother? - Disappeared. - Father? - Disappeared. - Grandparents or relatives? - Disappeared. - Friends? - Disappeared. - Acquaintances? - Disappeared. - I see. But you sort of knew her, huh? - Aye. - So then you're kind of an acquaintance? - Aye. - So why are you still here? - I disappeared a week ago, but I'm trying to keep it quiet. - Right, I see. Now you have a nice day. - Disappear. - Okay. (upbeat band music) (cat meows) (Mayor Smith grumbles) - Well I think I can be proud of my achievements so far. (cat meows) Of course, we've had a few minor hiccups. (cat meows) - Mister Mayor? - You know, but I think I've been lucky enough to find my true vocation. - Mr. Mayor.

Yeah, come, come, come, follow me. - [Major Cowpat] That's the chap I lent the caravan to. - [Mr. Tallman] He's the one who's been asking questions. - [Major Cowpat] What a lovely Mumbo. - The Mumbo Jumbo has arrived. - He's arrived. - He did have a funny face. - Oh, I've never seen such a silly hat. - He had the eyelashes of a silver fox. - But he's the only visitor we've had in Sinmouth since that unfortunate business with the custard. He must be- - The Mumbo Jumbo! - The Mumbo Jumbo doesn't exist. - Huh? - It's a myth. - I don't know. - Oh, I'm so happy. - So am I. (men giggling) - Fertilizer, that's what I believe in, gentlemen. - Yes, but- - But... - Yes? - Yes, but? - I believe in what I can see, touch, and smell. I believe in dung. - Sorry? - I beg your pardon, slurry. - Oh. - I certainly don't believe in the Mumbo Jumbo. - [Thomas] I just couldn't sleep so I went down to the beach. (soft guitar music) (soft music) (birds chirping) - Uh. Uh. (clears throat) Uh, um. (clears throat) It's an incredible honor to have you visit our humble island, your grace. - Yeah, well, gee, I'm really glad to be here. Thanks. - Oh, believe me, I mean it. A man of my caliber is used to celebrities. I've meet them all, you know. Nelly Longbottom would dance topless on the radio. - Nelly Longbottom? - Oh, yeah. She made a great job of judging the 1974 Ugly Baby competition. Oh, I'd have her back like a shot. But not that gigolo of course. We've worn on since the day he visited. - I'm sorry to hear about that Mayor, uh? You know, I didn't catch your last name. - It's a bit of a snag there. I was never quite able to muster its pronunciation. (soft, strange music) - What? (upbeat orchestral music) Hey, impressive plants. - Oh yes, it's the fertilizer, you know. - Really? - We're famous for our excrement. Oh, it's on everybody's lips. Oh, wonderful stuff. I don't know what Mr. Bounder puts in it, but, by golly, it certainly does the trick. - Hey, I've seen these all over Sinmouth. What's going on? - You really don't know? Nobody briefed you? - Briefed me? - No background notes? No discussion? Nothing? - Not so much as a sub clause. - Well people have been disappearing from Sinmouth, you know? - What? - They're vanishing without a trace. I mean, yesterday was Arthur Pinhead, and the day before with Mary Eggcup. And then there was what's her name- - Now, I have heard about this. What are the cops saying? - PC Cripple, he was the first to go. Good riddance, I say. - How do? - Hello Mumbo Jumbo. - Hm. - Princess Vanilla, what's happened to her- - Uh, then there was Dan Gurney and his life boat, and Mr. Honey, the butcher. - Oh, hello Mumbo Jumbo. My pickle flan is in the oven. - Well that has nothing to do with me, madam. - Mustn't dither. - What is going on here? Now who does she think I am? Who is this Mumbo Jumbo? - Well you are. - What? - Oh, you're the Mumbo Jumbo. - Me? - You. - No I'm not. - Oh yes you are. - No, I'm not. - Oh yes you are. - Oh no I'm not. - You are. - No, I'm not. - Yes you are. - Oh no. - Yes, you are. - No, I'm not, - You're a source box, you are. - No, I'm not. - Yes. - No. - Yes you are. - No, I'm not. - Yes you are. - No, I'm not. - Yes you are. - No, I'm not. - Yes you are. - Oh no I'm not. - Yes you are, you're the Mumbo Jumbo. - Oh god, no, I'm out of here. - Oh no, please, please, please don't go. Look, would you like to borrow a vote of confidence? Look, I haven't even shown you me mole hills. - Look, I am not the Mumbo Jumbo, okay? Leave me alone. - Oh, please. Please, look, we've got to pack with the rarest of babies to wipe. Wait. It's a folklore thing. - Oh. - Oh. (tense, strange music) (birds calling) - [Major Cowpat] Wait. (tense, strange music) Might be a swine. - Might be a turkey. - [Mr. Tipple] Here we are. Is that the Pleasure Palace? (tense, dramatic music) (laughing) - Mumbo Jumbo to save Sinmouth. (laughing) The Mumbo Jumbo. (laughing) Aye! I don't want you smoking in here. Mumbo Jumbo. (laughing) (Princess Vanilla sobbing) (soft music) (tense, dramatic music) (thunder rumbling) (tense, dramatic music) - You know, if the Mumbo finds out about this place, we're, we're all- - We're all... - We're all? - You're all worrying about nothing. (laughs) I assure you, gentlemen, there's no such thing as the Mumbo Jumbo. - But Mr. Bounder, you heard him. Funny words, funny accent. I mean, we all heard him. - I heard something. Something that is perfectly explainable. I certainly didn't hear any Mumbo Jumbo casting spells or anything. (laughs) Gentlemen, please, allow me to show you your Pleasure Palace. Yes, thanks to your accountancy, Sinmouth will soon have its very own testimony to sin. (dramatic music) - Will there be sausage rolls? - What? - You know, sausage rolls.

I've not been the same since I had that cyst lanced. - I'm sorry to hear that, Archie, but what about my equipment? - Ah, I've been working on a soft molded extrusion plasma valve and as soon as that is hunky dory like, we'll get down to some real human mincing. - Excellent. Excellent. - I can start it tonight, like, you know, but what with me scurvy and me secretions turning out a rather worrying shade of green, like, probably be tomorrow before it's up and running. - Now that reminds me, you've not been flushing things down the toilet again, have you? - Oh no, Mr. Bounder, oh no, no, no. - [Lucifer] I could've sworn I'd heard that cyst emptied more than usual last night. - Oh, no, that's all behind me now, ever since the counseling, like.

Mr. Bounder, you don't think you see a way clear to giving me next Wednesday afternoon off? - Wednesday afternoon? - Well, you know, I've got to see this bloke, like, about contracting a black plague. - Well, what time were you thinking of? - Oh, 3:30. - Could you make it four o'clock? - Four o'clock's fine. It'll only take a second, like, see, 'cause all he's got to do is put it in. - [Lucifer] What is your favorite dessert? (upbeat music) (upbeat news music) - He rid our land of plague and pestilence in 1627. He ended the mashed potato famine of 1851, and in 1906, he banished the name Colin forever from our shores. But tonight, Sinmouth is poised on the brink of the biggest crisis since the great underpants shortage of 1933. And now, as then, only the Mumbo Jumbo can save us and Princess Vanilla shall return. - [Thomas] It was only when I heard the radio I realized that all I had to do was pretend to be the Mumbo Jumbo in order to finally find Vanilla and claim my reward. - And now, comparing his very own penis shaped carrot with last year's champion, it's back to Bob. - Hello, Sinmouth. (people chattering) (cameras clicking) (soft music) - But the nose. You want to give it strength, a drop of nobility, grandeur. So I look a little haughty. A drop of culture. Yes, that's what it needs, a drop of horticulture. So anyone can look at me and say now, there is man with clout. - Clout with snout. - Oh, your highness. Everything all right, then? - Yeah, everything's just fine. - Well that's good. - Listen. If I am the Mumbo Jumbo, will Princess Vanilla definitely come back? - Well, that's a very good question. Let me put it this way... - Just a simple yes or no, please. - If that's the attitude, yes. She'll be back. - Thank you very much. - And remember, to get on in this life you have to grab the bull's horn. (chuckles) Now, look. - Here we go. Your highness. - Kind thanks, Archie. - There we are. Here. The mayor summoned up the Mumbo Jumbo to help restore Sinmouth. Now, I've not seen him meself, like, but I hear he's a bit of a hero. - What kind of hero? Tall? Dark? Handsome? - Oh. He's (wheezes) handsome. - Brown eyes? Hazel? Blue? - A uh, uh, a blue-y- blue-y brown. - And uh, would you say that he was really skinny, or nicely toned, or muscular? - Oh, he's, he's very nicely toned. - And does he speak with a common tongue, or is he interesting and charming? Or dull and boring? - Oh, oh, interesting and charming. - And if we're on a desert island, and there was one piece of fruit left, would he share it, or would he throw it into the sea so that we would die a tragic death in each other's arms? Or would he eat it himself? - He'd throw it into the sea so that you could die a tragic death in each other's arms. - My god, how romantic. - Look, I've got to go and salt me pus filled warts and boils, all right? So, goodnight. - Goodnight. - I gave her four hail Mary's, and if you want my opinion, she'd be better keeping her legs crossed. - Chinwag? - Yes? - Pull yourself together, will you? - Oh, I do beg your pardon, Mister Mayor. - I don't think so. I've called this emergency meeting in the middle of the night because during the past three years, over two million has disappeared from the council's coffers. - Oh. - It's as if to say we are broke. - [Mr. Tallman] ] That's terrible. - I mean, does anywhere here know where the money has gone? - No, I've got no idea. - No idea. - No idea. - Uh no (clears throat) no idea. - Most peculiar. I mean, any other mayor would naturally assume that the council had been embezzling the money- (council members chattering) Oh, the Lord be praised. I'm blessed with the most- - [Major Cowpat] I'm sure you'll get to the bottom of it. - Honest- - I hope not. - [Mayor Smith] Trustworthy, praiseworthy. - Oh really? - Reliable, honorable group of men that any pillar of society could wish for. (sobbing) - Goodnight. - Goodnight. (Mayor Smith sobbing) - I'm sorry, Chinwag, I'm sorry. Sometimes it just gets too much for me. (people yelling) - I know what you mean, darling, but it could be a serial killer, a flasher, a junkie, a trainspotter, or a transvestite. He could have germs. - Please. - Sorry, darling. But he could be a truly tedious Mumbo. - Actually, Bunty, I hear he's kind of cute. Oh, rough and tough around the edges, like he could kill a lion or wrestle a tiger. Oh, how competent. (Princess Vanilla chuckles) (soft music) - Where is she? - Oh Mr. Bounder? Mr. Bounder? We've been thinking, Mr, Bounder- - Yeah, we want out. - Mission aborted. - Yes, we've done our bet. - Putting our necks on the line. - Yes, and we've raised the money for the Pleasure Palace. - Look, Mr. Bounder, the net's closing in. - Time to beat a hasty retreat. - That Mumbo's on to us, I know he is. And besides- - Princess. - I've got my little petal to thing of. Oh, granddad's little angel. Pity about the Port Wine mark there. - And I've got a machete and three hand grenades to take care of. - Gentlemen, shh! Just stay here until I give you the signal. May I introduce myself? My name is Lucifer Bounder. - Well I'm the Mumbo Jumbo, that's me. Oh, I'm lookin' for Princess Vanilla. You don't know what happened to her, do you? - Vanilla? - The ice cream? - Shh. (whistles) So that's your game. Well I promise you, you will never find her. And now I know that you're not the Mumbo Jumbo. - I am the Mumbo Jumbo. - He is the Mumbo Jumbo. - [Major Cowpat] Advance with caution, men. (whistles) - Now tell them who you really are. Tell them that you're not the Mumbo Jumbo. - Wait, wait. - Oh look, look. (chuckles) All you need is a needle, a block of ice, and you won't feel a thing. - Well I'll think about it. Wait, look, gentlemen. Give the Jumbo some peace. This man is a artiste. - I'm afraid, Mister Mayor, there has been a mistake. Tell him. - Hey, watch it, buddy. Me and Tinkerbell are like this. - Yes, and I'm Captain Hook. - [Mayor Smith] Captain Hook? - Look, don't listen to this guy, all right? He's a wise ass. I am the Mumbo Jumbo. And what do you mean I will never find her? - Well if you are the Mumbo Jumbo, let's see you perform some magic. - Okay. I mean, what could I do? I was in a pretty tight situation. Don't ask me how I did it, 'cause I couldn't tell ya. I am the Mumbo Jumbo. - [Mayor Smith] Ooh. (gasps) Ooh. (dramatic music) (grand orchestral music) - Oh, my. That's not something you see everyday. (grand orchestral music) - The town hall had a complete makeover. I mean, it was more than amazing. It was supernatural. It was magic. I don't believe it. I just don't believe it. I'm a guy looking for a job, that's all. I'm just a guy looking for a regular nine to five gig to pay the rent and now, now, I'm Yoda. (chuckles) I can't handle this kind of career leap. - [Mayor Smith] Tea up. (chuckles) - I mean, I can't be the chosen one. I flunked out of Sunday school. - Come on, lad, have a cup of tea. Here, here, have a ginger biscuit, aye? Kit Kat? - No. - A jammy dodger? - Nothing. - No to a jammy dodger? - Excuse me, can't you see that I have a little bit of a situation here? - Take a 10 minute recess, aye? Come on, now lad. Have a Penguin, aye? Relax. - Relax? You want me to relax? Did you just see what happened out there? I mean, I am the Mumbo Jumbo. (laughs) - I haven't been this happy since I got a two-thirds majority for my urine motion. (laughing) - Don't mention it. (soft music) - Here you go, love. I brought you a little treat. - No thanks, Archie. Oh, Archie? Could you do me a favor? - Well. I can't, really. - Oh Archie- - Oh no, you see, there's no more bones. Not even the pelvis. I ate it. - What I actually wanted was for you to deliver this note to the Mumbo Jumbo. - Oh. What does it say? - It's, uh, private. I'm asking him if he wants me to weave him a wig. - Oh. (laughs) That's all right. He'll look good in a wig. (laughs) Bye, love. (Mayor Smith sighs) - With the long journey through life, there comes a time when every great man has his moment. Well this is mine. My moment. (chuckles) - Pardon? - My moment. - Oh, your moment? - Yes. (claps) Please, please. Please. (soft music) (tense, dramatic music) (coughing) - A little message from the princess, all right? Sleep tight, go to sleep. Shh. Oh, shh. Here comes the Sandman. Oh, hang about. Princess might need helping. (tense, dramatic music) - Ooh. Cooey, cooey. Princess Vanilla? Will you marry me? Will you marry me, my fair maiden? - Never. - Oh. Oh, what a shame. Perhaps you'd prefer life when you are dead, and then I wouldn't have to waste my time at the bottom of these stairs every night! Temper, temper. Control. I'll give you until tomorrow night to change your mind, and then it's the mincer for you. The mincer.

Look, there has been a minor problem. Now, allow me to go into it in some detail. - Did you get into the small print? - Well, great. - An over characteristic underside, Mr. Jumbo. - That's fine. - The consequences for summoning up a Mumbo Jumbo. - What consequences? - Consequences. (men chattering) This will do. Now then, listen to this: "Two brilliant comets "will move across the sky to form "an incredible energy mass that will cast "beneath it a ray of divine light "unto the Mumbo Jumbo and the miracle shall occur." - You have to be there, you see, at that precise moment. - Yes, 11:52 tonight. - At the highest point in Sinmouth. - Which is the top of Mr. Bounder's castle. - Aye, whoa, I'm not a celestial power socket, all right? - Oh, but you do have the power of Mumbo Jumbo. - Comet or no comet, I'm toast for no one. - Oh, it's going to be explosive. - Oh, explosive. - Why? - Oh, listen here. Small print. "With no Mumbo Jumbo present, a same brilliant comet "will fall and," and - [Both] "Incredible-" - "Energy mass, but at the same time, "a ray of divine light will hit the earth, "making it unstable causing-" - [Both] "The end of civilization." - Hey, this is some serious voodoo shit you guys have conjured up here. - Oh, it's going to be an obnoxious affair. - Very obnoxious. - [Mayor Smith] Unless you're there tonight, you ding dong. - [Thomas] Better late than never, I realized it was the amulet I needed to find Princess Vanilla. - A lot of screaming. - Lots of screaming.

(muffled grunting) (tense, dramatic music) - [Major Cowpat] Hello. - [Lucifer] Gentlemen. (Mr. Tallman gasps) - Oh. - Oh for goodness sake, what kind of wicked, sinful men are you supposed to be? - [Mr. Tipple] But you said you just wanted to talk with him, Mr. Bounder. - Yeah. - Aye. - I lied. And now I have work to attend to. Yes, work on your Pleasure Palace. - Oh. (clapping) - But you'll have to earn it first. You. Kill him! (tense, dramatic music) (muffled grunting) (tense, dramatic music) - Oh, give me that. (banging) (pinging) We're not killers. - No, and we've got a confession to make. Now, there's two million missing from the council funds. That's why Sinmouth is in the state it is. And we took the money. - We embezzled it. We were doing it for Bounder, but we were wrong. - Bad show. The only decent thing to do now is... - Oh, painful. Yes. We're sorry. And we're going to change. - Change back to the way we were: honest, law-abiding people. Group hug? - [Thomas] So they came clean. They'd embezzled the money, but I had to save Sinmouth. (dramatic music) - Archie? - Oh, hi. - I know what you've been up to. A dirty, mookie, manky little man. - Oh? - Toilets were designed solely for flushing away human affluence and when you know it, Archie, I'm going to send you back to the clinic. - Oh no, not the clinic, Mr. Bounder. - Shut your gob! Now, how are things coming on? - Oh, brilliant. Right champion. - Good. Now, is is operational, yet? - Yes, well it will be just as soon I've had... As soon as I've had...

Not any body, a doubting body. Welcome to the family business, hm? We're related.

No, no, no, I meant to say I'm your great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather. - Right. - You're gonna be the Mumbo Jumbo for the next millennium. - Wait, are you- - You passed the test. - What test? I haven't passed any test. - You believed. You put aside your prejudice and you opened your mind to others. You see, Thomas, miracles really do happen. You must always believe. - But the amulet, I've lost it. - You'll remember. You will remember. Good luck. (buzzing) (soft music) (blasts) (ethereal music) (tense, dramatic music) (soft music) - Yes.

(thunder rumbling) (tense, dramatic music) (people yelling) - Hey. You work here? - Ah, yes, I do. - I need you to go up and tell Princess Vanilla to meet me on the roof. - Oh no, I can't do that, no. - Do you understand? - No, no I can't. - You're never gonna see this again. - All right, all right, but not the brush. No, no, not the brush. The end of the brush, and I'm not going up anyway. (tense, dramatic music) - Oh, stop complaining. Just be grateful that your lives aren't ending in vain. You're about to become the finest fertilizer in the world. There's no pleasing some people, is there? Oh, this is a great day, seeing the end of the end of the animals, now I can see the destruction of the humans. (laughing) - Let them go, Bounder. - Archie, seize him. - Oh, not with me perforated bowels, Mr. Bounder. - I said move! (Archie farts) (Archie mumbling) (tense oriental music) (hits) (Archie grunts) - Now, go get the princess. - Right. I will do that. - Leave that alone! I said- - I better go right now. Whoa. A swollen scrotum. (crunching) (groaning) - Is this the right queue? - All those blindfolds, chains, and the gates can only mean one thing. Pleasure, my dear boy, pleasure. - Pleasure. - Pleasure. - Through that door is our Pleasure Palace. - Oh, where are the girls? - Where's the goodies? - Where's the sausage rolls? (tense, dramatic music) - Bounder, don't do this. Don't kill anymore of these innocent people. You can change. I know you can. (Lucifer yells) - Change? Hardly. (Bounder mumbles) - Bounder, don't do this. Anyone can change. I've experienced it myself. Lucifer, redemption can be yours. - Redemption? And meet all the angels? I've been bored by them before. Never! (grunting) (dramatic music) (Lucifer yelling) (dramatic music) (girls scream) There's no such thing as the Mumbo Jumbo. It's a myth. It's a legend. Only people don't fall for legends, people need proof. - Sometimes you don't need proof. Sometimes you just need to believe. - Yes. Yes, you're right. Yes. Hm, yes. You've got a point. - What are you doing? - We must all show tolerance. It makes perfect sense. Now give me your hand. Oh, please forgive me, Thomas. Please forgive me. - See, I thought the two of us were gonna get it on. - Fight? Oh, it's so tiresome and vulgar, don't you think? Come on, girls, help me dismantle this mechanical monster. - Well in the light of recent developments, I think that's very commendable of you. - I'll release all the prisoners, including of course Princess Vanilla. I wish you both all the best in the world. - Well I guess that's it then. (soft music) - We're only moments away Chinwag. (sighs) Only moments away. (chuckles) (soft music) Custard tart? - Don't bring custard into this. - I'm sorry, I forgot. - Oh, princess. You've got to go up the tower, otherwise I'll never ride a bicycle again. (groans) (tense, dramatic music) - Ah! It's you. Wow. - A thousand days and a thousand nights, Bounder's confined me. And in my absence, his evil ways have been free to cast treachery and darkness across my kingdom. Kind and gentle soul, how ever shall I thank thee? - Do you always speak like that? See, I've had a hell of a week and I was really hoping you were going to be normal. - Oh I am. Surprising what you write when you've got nothing to do for a thousand nights. - Right. - [Princess Vanilla] Got a about a minute and a half left. - Oh, a whole minute and half. Why was I worried? Well, we should just hang out and- - Get to know each other? - Yeah, right. You did say a minute? - And a a half. - So uh, how was it? Being held prisoner? - Cold. - Cold, yeah, I bet. - But I'm getting warmer now. You know, I've heard so much about you. I feel like we're yin and yang. - Well listen, if I don't get this right, we're gonna be more like sushi. - Well I'm just grateful that you, my handsome prince, have come to rescue me at last. - Hey listen, I'm not a prince, okay? I'm not your highness or your lord ship. I'm Thomas, Thomas Doubting. - Die! (hitting) (Lucifer grunting) (yelling) - Foiled again! (yelling) (hits) (grunts) (tense, dramatic music) - Let's get things back to normal. - All right. (blasting) (ethereal music) - [Lucifer] I shall return. I shall return. I shall return. - [Mayor Smith] Oh, oh it's over, it's over. Oh. All the little dogs and cats are back. And the children, all the little children. Oh. Oh, I knew this would happen. I knew I could rely on Mumbo Jumbo, oh. Oh, there's little Maisy Wallabe. Oh, how exciting. Oh, her mum will be so happy. Ooh, oh my goodness, what an exciting dance. Let me join in.

My word, they have done a good job. - You think it looks like him? - Well, it's definitely got his, uh, nose. - That's true. It's certainly got his chin. - He's a bit of a silver fox, isn't he? - Oh, thank you. (chuckles) Well, it took a lot of spit and polish, you know, but being the perfectionist I am, I had to go that extra inch, that extra mile, to set a good example to you, my friends. Oh yes, I think you can take notice of how I've behaved because believe me, these last few years have been a difficult time. - [Thomas] So, that's my story. Now I'm back in the outside world and I'm living with the princess. Well, I call her Vanilla. And who knows, I mean maybe one of these days, I'll get summoned again and I'll meet up with Tallman and Tipple and Cowpat, maybe even the Mayor and Chinwag. Or maybe I won't. But either way, I'll always be the Mumbo Jumbo. Well, at least for the next thousand years.
