What's in fashion now is... - to have a purebred dog. - How? Breed dogs. They are very expensive. - Is that so? - They cost between 22,000 and 28,000. You're gonna have to excuse me, I need to go to the bathroom. Sure. Come back. if you want more information. - You want a St. Bernard? - They're crazy about them. I'm looking for a million for this to take off. Blondie. I have a business opportunity for you. The Chinese market is booming. China Yes. The middle class has quadrupled. 200 to 800 million in 10 years. - They're swimming in money. - Yes, everyone wants... I want to found a breed dog business in China. - Raising dogs. Saint Bernard. - I see. Every time they see a Saint Bernard, they go crazy. I call it the Western Panda. Investors are dying to participate. They want to invest in this business, but I give them long, because I need the right investor. And I think it's you. You wouldn't have to do anything. I just need an investment and I know your father died. Yeah, that's right. I'm sure there's an inheritance. Yeah, yeah, sure. How much do you need? - No more than 2 million. - I'll think about it. Rasmus, what was the purpose of the Herlufsholm School? - Friendship. - No, not at all. Business connections. Herlufsholm: "We enrich each other. I don't know much about dogs and... You don't have to. I'll take care of everything. I'm the one with the contacts. Look, if it's because I abused you. at school, I beg your pardon. Believe me, this is a great opportunity. Think about it. I'm going to make a call. - Oh, yes, of course. - Okay, yeah. - I'll make a call, too. - Okay. Hi, Mom. Not a thing. Could you ask more small sheets from this collection? - Yes, it is. - Grey. The shelves are empty. - I'll do it later. - No, I would like you to do it now. - Now? - Yes . - Did you have a good weekend? - Yes. I was at my old school, Herlufsholm. Herlufsholm? - Yes, it is. - Did you go there? Yes. - But it's an elite school. - Yes. Okay. [Chuckles] Don't be so surprised, Mohamed. And you've worked here ever since? I've also worked in other places. - Yes, it is. - Where? IKEA. You've come to the land of dreams. Yes. I always say, ''We don't sell beds, "We sell dreams. Yeah, good boy. You're a good boy. What's this? What's this? Yes, a cookie. Good boy. You want another cookie? Dad, if you look at page 8, I don't know if you've reached it, but you'll see that market analyses suggest that interest in expensive things in China, like St. Bernard, grows between 5 and 8% in the middle class and that the middle class is growing, is exponential growth. What is estimated is that in five years there will be a gain of five times the investment. That's 500%. It is unique. We're familiar with breeding techniques. - We will put that experience into practice. - Okay. If you're an investor, you can assist in that, too. What's the matter with you now? Come on. Yeah, that's right. What I'm asking is a small investment of two million. It's all very solid. That sounds fantastic. Good job. And the numbers look good. But we've been like this before, Frederik. You don't have a gift..... for business. But you do, don't you, Dollar? You do have a gift for business. What's this? What's this? Dad, at least leave to take me to Dollar at the exhibition. - Are you out of your mind? - Okay. - You know where the exit is. - Yes. See you, Frederik. Well... - This office is new, isn't it? - Not really. Rasmus, we asked you to come. for the results of the tests we did on you. Yes. Rasmus, I don't think you're well. - But I feel good. - Yes. Have you ever heard of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis? No. Also called ELA. Do you know who Stephen Hawking is? - Yes, it is. - He has ALS. Okay. [Chuckles] So... But is it very serious? - It's serious. - Is it? It's serious, Rasmus. It affects your muscles. You lose muscle mass. At some point you'll have difficulty walking. You'll be limited in a wheelchair, with difficulty swallowing, it will cost you to walk and... I believe that Stephen Hawking has lived too long with this disease. DAD: "WHERE THE HELL IS THE DOLLAR? Hello, Kaj. I'm just calling to tell you that there will be some retreats from my account in the next few months. Yeah, that's right. If you could remove the blockade, that would be great. My card wasn't stolen by a Chinaman. who was partying in China. It's not about that. Yeah. I know that. I'm doing business here, so I'll use every penny of it. I'll do it. I'll do it. Take care of yourself in Denmark. Okay, bye. ''Dear Mr. Xi Jinping. I hope your St. Bernard, Comrade.... is okay. Cordial greetings. "Mr. Jorgensen. J-O-R... G-E-N... S-E-N. I'm sorry about all this.

Who do you think the boss is? Okay, thank you. He also thought I was the boss. What else is there to do today? Today? I'm rolling an ad down here. Okay. [Chuckles] That's a little expensive. We made one at Comfort Beds. that was broadcast on local television. It cost a fortune. I'd like to see the budget. I have a lot of experience with that. Dollar! Look at this! You want to take a picture of him? Sure. Photo! Dollar, look! Okay. [Chuckles] It's perfect. - Yes, you can touch it. - How old is he? - Five years. - Five?

I'm sorry, I didn't know you didn't drink. I can finish it for you. As you know, I come from a family of dog breeders. We've been doing it for four generations, so we know a lot about this. What I want you to do in St. Bernard's Syndicate is to make buying a dog easier. I want you to establish a closer relationship with the client. It can become in subscriber of the services that our company offers. You can buy a subscription for dog food, for vaccines, to visit the vet, you know, that kind of thing. that make you have a dog is a pain in the ass. Yeah, create a new lifestyle. Yeah, if you create a new lifestyle, You can make money out of it. We need a Chinese investor. I think we'd need about 15 million. Maybe our model should be of four square meters. Okay. [Chuckles] It's better, because when I need investors, they'll have to see it. Very nice. Lovely. Much better now. I'm building a kennel for St. Bernard's dogs. I want a kennel map that shows the facilities where the dogs live. When you see it, you should think, ''Here's room for half a million dogs. Where are you from? I'm from Shanghai. - I'm from Denmark. - Denmark Denmark. What do you do? - A little bit of everything. - Good. People don't want trouble. They just want the good stuff. of having a dog, the company and all that shit. If you take the problems out of the equation, it'll be a lot easier for people to say, "I want a dog. In fact, I'm going to present this business soon. If you want to know more, - is welcome. - Perhaps. If you have time, it'd be great to see him around. It's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Ling. - Cheers. - Health. Can I have another, please? Do you want another one? - Yes, it is. - Make that two more. Can you sleep at night? Yes, I can.

Hey, girls. - Good to see you. - Good to see you. - Good morning, sir. - You look very pretty. In the name of the San Bernardo Syndicate, I mean, I'm very excited. Welcome on board and let the rocket take off. Beyond, I think the number one priority is to translate the web page, then take a questionnaire for market analysis and contact residences. Marketing residences? I'm talking about institutions for the elderly, like nurseries. They could buy a dog and have him as a companion animal. Both in Denmark as in China there is a big problem with people who suffer from dementia. Do you know what dementia is? "I don't remember anything. Why did I take my pills? You know, people who don't remember who they are or who their families are. They usually run away. And it's a very... Finding them is very expensive. You have to call helicopters and sometimes they're in a ditch or a lake swimming. But they have dogs at home, that will considerably reduce the number of people who get lost. So, could you call to the most prestigious residences and talk to them about buying a dog? Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah. - Jenny, social media strategy. - Okay. We need to have a presence in social media in China. - Curious facts. - Curious data. Curious facts about dogs. You learn something and also... Do you know what that is? It's very popular in Europe, newspapers do. Everybody does it. It's like... Five things that you didn't know about the St. Bernard. Five things you didn't know you wanted to know. Did you know that St. Bernard originated in Austria and Switzerland? It's a mountain dog. Chongqing is the mountain city, isn't it? Mountain dog in the city mountain. - Yes, it is. - It's a great slogan. It's a very good slogan. ''Mountain dog in the mountain city. - Take the dog to the children's house. - That's what we're doing. What happens before and after that? At the beginning of history... This is the real beginning of this story. The Danish person, the Danish person, the Danish person, the Danish person, the Danish person, the Danish person, the Danish person, the Danish person, the Danish person, the Danish person, the Danish person, the Danish person, the Danish person, the Danish person. takes the puppy to this family. - And who are we? - You?

Why is that? I don't know. If you were here, I think you'd understand. We should have gone out at school. You're right, we should have. Too bad we didn't. Thank goodness we are now in China. Has anyone called? Investors or... - No, I'm not. - Have you sent an e-mail or...? Oh, wow! You always hit very well. DAD Hello, Beyond. I'm Rasmus. Your boss. Yes. Yeah, one of your bosses.

You can give him a kiss. This is amazing. Did he build it? - Yes, it is. - Did it occur to you in your sleep? Did it occur to you in a dream? Yeah, think about it all the time. He's got it in mind. - Meatballs. - Meatballs? Yes. Let me tell you. The situation of dogs in the world is almost the same as that of humans. A dog can overthrow a government. Dogs have a lot of power. Do you know why presidents from the U.S. and Russia want dogs? - A dog is a kind of symbol. - It is a symbol of power. Putin needs a dog. Without a dog he couldn't maintain his power. The dog is man's best friend. Dogs have political power. Shinzo Abe gave Putin an Akita. Your partner will betray you, but a dog will never do that. A dog isn't just an animal. It is like the soul of a man. - Is it a man's soul? - Yes. Could you tell him that Mr. Jorgensen would appreciate what he's saying about dogs? And that I would love to introduce you to Mr. Jorgensen. - Introducing you to Mr... - Introduce him to Frederik. - Yeah, I know. I know. - Because today he has diarrhea. He couldn't make it today because of the diarrhea. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Forgive me. What the hell is wrong with me? Yes, hello, Mr. Jorgensen. I'm your partner, Rasmus Homburg. I'd like to invite you to dinner tonight. We have something to celebrate. So I'll see you around. at 34 Jaffron Bay, to tell you everything about our new future. That's all there is to it. 34 Jaffron Bay. If you don't come, you miss it. - What's this? What's this? It's the fish. - Yes, one of the two fish. Okay. [Chuckles] I took a walk in the city today. It's interesting in many ways. And I went through some sort of of an amusement park. A Chinese man named Liu built it from a vision. And he loves dogs. - He loves dogs. - Very much so. He adores Dollar. - What do you do for a living? - He is a confectioner. I told him you had diarrhea. and that's why you couldn't go. That you have a weak stomach. Where did I put my beer? It's over there. - Have you tasted the fish? - No. What do you think, Beyond? Do you like Liu-san? Yes, he understands Dollar very well. - Do you understand Dollar? - Yes I'd like to meet him. I think you should meet him. - Good work, Beyond. - Yes, well... I was the one who spoke the most, but... - Beyond translated. - That's the deal. Look at his calendar and mine, and we'll set up a meeting. That's a dildo! It's a Danish joke. - It's not funny. - It's like in English ''deal though.'' - Dildo? - Yeah, it's like ''deal though.'' But it is... - It's because it sounds like dildo. - Yes. He thinks it's funny, but I don't. This is my partner, Mr. Jorgensen and Dollar. - Hey! Hey! - Hello. You can smile. Come on, take a picture! This is a chick and this is her father. Mr. Liu builds castles and has a bakery. - First the bakery... - And then the castle. We'll sit here and we'll wait until... We'll wait for Mr. Liu, yes. Do you like it when I do this? Yes, you like it when I do it. Isn't it? Salivas a lot. Salivas a lot. Yes, you do. - What the fuck are you doing? - What? - What the fuck are you doing? - I'm stroking Dollar. - Leave the dog alone, Rasmus. - But he wants to talk to me. Can't you just leave him alone? I think he needs leave the dog alone. But the dog wants to talk to me. The first thing is to raise capital to get an installation that will allow us to start raising dogs here and sell them. Build a breeding facility it's not too hard. Although it's better to build, for example, a cookie factory, but Dollar being the main theme. Let me get this straight. First, do we promote Dollar like a cookie dog and then we started selling dogs who want a cookie dog? - Yes, I do. - I'm going to explain this to Frederik. so he'll understand. - Frederik... - I understand. I understand perfectly. What is our role in all this? - Because I raise dogs. - It's a cookie company. It's a cookie factory. who also sells dogs. You can choose between buying dogs or cookies. We need people to worship Dollar, for the dog to sell cookies. - Yes, it is. - Yes. - I don't have time for that shit. - That's a good idea. No, I have things the most important things to do. I know it's a tough business, but... So you're not interested? - You sell dog food. - Yes. But you're an interior decorator? I don't do breeding anymore. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I think they'd be great. some slides. I have to leave you. Yeah, we have a meeting now. We talked, Jason. Hey, girls. We're having a housewarming party. on Wednesday from 16:00 to 18:00. I just confirmed it with Jason. It's a new beginning, so I've invited everyone. We have to think in a couple of hours of fun. I think we should start the night with a speech of mine. - We should show Dollar. - With some balloons. - Yeah, balloons and confetti. - Yes. - Do you know what confetti is? - No. It's in a tube and it bursts. It comes out and it rains confetti. Yeah, that's right. And also balloons. Maybe they can hang from the ceiling. What budget do we have for all this? The sky is the limit. I think that's... - I don't know if the sky is the limit. - We have to have a good party. - It can't be simple. - Okay. You can tell the story of the cat! - Your mother's friend's cat. - At the housewarming party? - Yes, it is. - The end of the story it could be that that's why you have to buy a dog and not a cat. The dog doesn't jump out the window. Okay, unfortunately we have to go, - do we all know what to do? - That's perfect. Yeah, come on! Get in! Who let the dogs out? Who let the dogs out? Who let the dogs out? Who let the dogs out? Tell them we have this room. until 4:00 and they're not ready yet, that we're sorry we're late, but we'll start soon. - Where are the guests? - Beyond? Maybe you can bring in people from the street to see the show, because no one's coming. I'll fire the confetti cannon. and then we'll get started. Okay? Okay, we have to go. There's only one. Just a microphone? Okay. Yeah, let's get started. Who let the dogs out? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't let the dogs out. Who let the dogs out? Turn off the music. - Jenny will take care of the music. - Okay. Jenny? Jenny, turn the music off. Yeah. You go. Are you ready? - Yes, it is. - Okay. Can you...? Hey, get off the stage. Get off. We paid for this room. Get off the stage. Yes. Offstage. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Are you ready? All right, let's get started. Confetti? No? How'd you do that? Dear friends, family and business partners of the San Bernardo Syndicate. Welcome to this cheerful and entertaining night... - that we celebrate... - It's all right. with all the best that our two cultures offer us. More than 100 years ago, the monks of the Monastery of San Bernardo discovered a breed of dog that would protect travelers and rescue those who were lost. in the snow. That dog was a Saint Bernard. and today, I also brought one to keep me safe on my journey. Please salute Dollar. He hit me in the balls. Thank you for your time. and now let's welcome him. to the amazing dancers of the San Bernardo Syndicate, ladies and gentlemen. Who's ahead? Who's ahead? Why did you stay behind? You should be here. Let's welcome the dancers. of the St. Bernard's Syndicate! That's it? Beyond? Where the hell is he? Let's give him a big round of applause. Beautiful. After this performance we could...

What the hell do you think? Tell me, what do you think? - After our failure. - I don't think it was so... You can't be so clumsy.

When I was a kid, my dad told me who would know the white dragon, to Pai Lung, in the future. Okay. [Chuckles] The white dragon is the king of water. Water, in China, means a lot of money. And today is the day. We have Pai Lung here. - Me? I don't know. - You, my friend. Pai Lung is you. Because I'm a white dragon or...? - Yes, it is. - Yes. Thank you very much. I feel like a dragon too. Inside, I feel like a dragon. You know, flying through the air, seeing all the citizens the little town... towns, and, you know, throwing fire on them. Sometimes I scare the hell out of them. Yes. That's enough. The problem is that you're too personal. Fire them. Use my people. - Consider them fired. - One more thing. Prepare 250,000 renminbis. to start this business. - Okay. [Chuckles] - Well, we have Pai Lung here. Everything's gonna be okay. Okay. [Chuckles] See you soon, Pai Lung. - Thank you. [Chuckles] - See you soon. This is pretty good. That's 14 million. You have to prepare 16 cigarettes for Mr. Ling. - We have to buy what? - Sixteen. - Sixty what? - Cigarettes. - Sixty? - Yes, sixteen. - Sixteen? - Sixteen packs of cigarettes. - For Mr. Ling. - How many? Sixteen or sixty? - Sixteen. - Sixteen cartons of cigarettes. - Yes, as a gift. - As a gift. Okay, perfect. Yes, we'll buy it. Consider it done. Yes. Yeah, I get it. - Was it sixteen or...? - Sixty. It makes no sense Tell where you used to work It makes no sense Say how much you used to earn It makes no sense Tell what you used to do This is the face Of Fu Manchu We brought you here because... - we have an investor. - An investor? Yes, an angel fallen from heaven, Mr. Ling. He is the founder of the Dugongo Group. Yes, we have to fire them, both of them. Yeah, unfortunately. we no longer need your services. It's nothing personal, is because he already has staff, and he thinks we can use and not have to pay someone else. Maybe it's a good thing, because before we had a professional relationship... - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - And now we can... have a date instead of... Because you can't have a date with your boss. But now... It's a joke. You don't have to answer. - It wouldn't be a problem anymore. - But you just fired them. - I'm trying to make this positive. - Sure, but for whom? I'm trying to convert the situation into something positive. - I know. I know. I know. - And the positive... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That was very unprofessional. Obviously, you shouldn't have a date with Rasmus. I think that's ridiculous. Unless you want to. Okay. [Chuckles] I don't think that's a good idea. that you're already going for the second. Why not? I love coconut. - Produces poop. - I've never heard that before. - You don't? - No, and I always eat it at home. I drink it and eat it. I put shredded coconut at breakfast. Have you heard of him? Oh, sure. And bits of coconut in the cereal. Rasmus, I know it looked like that I wasn't glad you were here. I just want to say I'm glad you came. - Thank you. [Chuckles] That's great. - I think... I think things are going well. and that you've contributed a lot. I'm glad you think so. I almost didn't come. At first I was a little skeptical, but I felt like... I went to the doctor before I came. That's a good idea. I always do that. Check blood pressure and stuff like that. It wasn't a checkup like that. I've had some tests. Y... I was diagnosed with ALS... right before I came. - What? I don't know. - I was diagnosed with ALS. What's that? What's that? That's what Stephen Hawking has. Muscular dystrophy. Muscles weaken. Then you die. You should take some medication. - Die? What do you say? - There is no medication. That's why I did this. For God's sake, Rasmus... - Yes, it is. - But why...? Why aren't you in a hospital? Shouldn't you be in bed? Why is that? I don't know. You can't... It has to be a mistake. You pick up the Chinese all the time. It can't be muscular dystrophy. I've had symptoms. Here too. I felt as if my tongue... fell down my throat. and made it hard for me to breathe. I feel like I'm drowning. I'm not happy about that. Rasmus. Yes, hello, Kaj. What is it? Yeah, I told you I'd withdraw money. Okay, how big is the discovered? Yeah, but I already explained to you who was doing business in China. Yes, Kaj, but the millions they'll start arriving soon, so you're gonna have to extend my line of credit. Listen to me, Kaj! You have to spend money to make money. That's right. Maybe I should find another bank when he starts making millions, Kaj. But for now... No, no, Kaj. - Quite a view, isn't it? - Yes. That bridge... See that building? The tall one. Next week it'll say "St. Bernard's Syndicate. - Really? An ad? - Yes, isn't it great? - It's the tallest building in town. -Really? I have to pay for it, so if you can transfer the money to me... Can't your father lend it to you? - No, I doubt it very much. - It's just that I'm broke. Kaj called me. I have a discovery. My card has been blocked. Is this a joke? Did Kaj call you? - Yeah, my financial advisor. - Your advisor called you. - To tell me I have a discovery. - But that's impossible. - No, I... - No, no. It can't be true. - You said you had 3 or 4 million. - I didn't say that. - You only had $84,000? - A little more than that. You're an idiot! What the hell are you thinking? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. - Get the fuck out of here. - I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. - Clean yourself up. - My hands are full of mud. What about Mr. Ling's cigarettes? It's an obligation. You have to call Kaj. Yeah, I'll call Kaj and tell him I need money for cigarettes. Don't tell him it's for tobacco. Just tell Kaj you need money. And give him something to back it up. I can't imagine what... - I have... - Yes. Mr. Ling, I'm glad to see you. - Your dragon is here. - Hello, Mr. Ling. Mr. Ling, we brought you cigarettes. Don't smoke them all at once. - Passport, please. - That's right. Here you go. Here you go. Why did he need the passports? To register the new company. It's just a formality. - I get it. I get it. The government... -It's like how much you... - I get it. I get it. - Okay. Now I need Dollar. What? I don't know. I need Dollar. Pai Lung knows. To secure our investment. I forgot to mention it, Frederik. You need Dollar for... - No, no, no, no, no. - What? No, I'm so sorry. That will not happen. - We have to give a guarantee. - He's not taking the dog with him. - They're not taking the dog. - You mean that old dog? - You'll get it back. - He's not taking the dog. They're going to invest 14 million. Dollar is the guarantee. - Come on, Frederik. - Shut up, Pai Lung. You know you're talking with a dragon, right? Can you stop that dragon shit? - Is there a problem? - No, no, no. Not at all. It's just... Frederik is very fond of the dog and wants to say goodbye to him. I know. I know. I know. - See? He understands perfectly. - Okay. - Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah. All right. - Okay. Of course. who can take the dog. - Did you know all this? - What? - Did you know he'd keep the dollar? - He told us. - What's next? - A photo, Pai Lung. The picture! Wherever you go... And since we're in China, we have to take a picture. Yes. I know. I know. I know. - Smile, Frederik. - Yes. And the thumb up. Or do like this. Called Mr. Ling. You cannot answer the phone at this moment. Leave a message. Maybe he went on vacation. And I ran out of money. - Come on. You need some help? - Just... - It's two-star. - Two stars? - Overlooking the sea. - It starts at three o'clock. No, start at one o'clock. It's eight dollars a night. Hello, Mr. Ling. I'm Mr. Jorgensen. We'd love to hear from you. Call me as soon as you can. how I heard this message. Hello, Mr. Ling. It's Mr. Jorgensen again. - Mr. Ling? - Mr. Ling! - Mr. Ling! - Mr. Ling! Mr. Ling, when you hear the message, call me, please. I'm Mr. Jorgensen again. We are very worried, so... we'd love to hear from you. Call us as soon as possible. Oh, damn it. What the hell are you doing in there? I needed to think. It's a weird place to think. I called Mr. Ling again. He still hasn't answered. - Maybe it's disconnected. - Draw your own conclusions. We've been swindled, Rasmus! They were only interested in money, gifts, cigars and take us our passports and Dollars. Maybe he's had an accident. This isn't a fucking novel! It's not a love story. with a happy ending. What gods did you talk to when you came up with the brilliant idea to give him our money, passports. and Dollar to a complete stranger? When? I don't know. Yes, yes. Yeah, I'll tell him. Mr. Jorgensen immediately. Yes, of course. that Pai Lung will be there. Oh, yes, of course I do. I'm the white dragon. All right, Mr. Ling. All right, I'll see you soon. Goodbye - It was Mr. Ling. - What? It was Mr. Ling. He called me to set up a meeting. - Fucking... - We have a meeting. - Oh, thank goodness. - In two days he will tell us the address. What'd I tell you? I don't care. I don't care. We have to celebrate. We'll celebrate with a good meal. I'll do the shopping. - Do you have any money? - I'll manage. Crash! That's great. You should open up. Food can wait. - Hi. [Chuckles] - Hi. I don't have any money on me. - No, I already paid for the suit, so... - Okay. - It's my suit. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Okay, bye. - Goodbye. Rasmus! Look what just arrived. Welcome back. I will accompany you to Mr. Ling. - Thank you - Ni hao. - Are you Mr. Ling's wife? - Mr. Ling. Good to see you. Thank you so much. We're so glad you called. It's good to see you again. I suppose you're hungry. - Yes, it is. - I'm hungrier than a dragon. Okay, let's have dinner. What's your name? - My name is Lisa. - Nisse. - Lisa. Lisa? - Okay. - I'm Eeeh. - Eeeh? - Yeah, Eeeh. - Eeeeeh? - Yes, it is. - Eeh. - Have you ever been to Europe, Nisse? - Okay. Hello. Hi. Okay. I have a story to tell you. It's not mine. It's a very funny story. The cat of the friend of Jenny's mother. One day, I was sitting at the window, and, from the 16th floor, he went out the window. - 19. - From the 19th floor, it's true. And he fell. He fell to the ground and died on the spot. He was crushed on the sidewalk. The cat. Meow. It stayed that way. It's a story funny and sad at the same time, but also a lesson to learn from. - I said... - It doesn't matter. Cheers. - Cheers. - Health. - Can I tell you a scary story? - A scary story? Yes. Then let's get a little closer. You must. - It's so scary. - We are all hugging now. I have a friend in secret. If you want someone to tell you the truth, all you need is a toothbrush. I don't get it. What would you use a toothbrush? Is this an interrogation? Actually, it's some kind of torture. - Okay, a toothbrush. - What do we do with it? You put it between your fingers and you turn it around. Thank you. You turn it, you turn it and you turn it. - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - It burns, okay? Then people will tell you everything you want to know. It's torture. - The worst torture. - It is, my friend. How do you know this story, Mr. Ling? It's very strange. - I have too many friends. - He has many friends. Mr. Ling, can I make you a quick question? I would like to know... if I can pick up one of your girls. - You don't have to ask. - What? Let's go! Let's go! You are Pai Lung. - I can do anything. - Sure. All right, all right, all right. This is very good. Frederik? We need to talk. Get out of here, man! Frederik, none of this is real. None of this apartment is real. Mr. Ling is a phony. You listen to me. Listen to me. Rasmus, she was a man before. I have never done this before. Mr. Ling? Mr. Ling, I need your attention. Where's Dollar? Where is my money? I'm talking to you. This is all a set. Would you like to play with me? This is just a game, I get it. This is just a game to you, but I want to play too. The doggie. Who took the bone from him? Did the doggie take his bone? You know that game? Doggy, who's got your bone? Exactly, that's what we're playing. It's not the dungeon master anymore, you know? This is like poker. Call the others. Whoever loses, toothbrush, okay? It's not me. It's time for torture, of the toothbrush. I want to do it again. Once again, it's a lot of fun. - Yeah, it's hilarious. - Let's laugh, shall we? Laugh, damn it. It's time to laugh. Play or we'll quit. Play or leave it, Rasmus. Don't take it out on her. Put the toothbrush on his back. I want to play this game one more time. Yes. All right! All right, you win! Now we torture you. - No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Take it. - No, I don't want this. - Yes, you do. - No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Are you ready? No? You don't want to play? I don't want to play this. Okay, so he has to drink. Let's take a little bit of baijiu. Do you know what it is? It's a Chinese drink. - He has to drink, okay? - All right. Okay, let's drink. Mr. Ling, tell me, where is Dollar? Yeah, where's Dollar? Where's Dollar? You have to answer me, Mr. Ling. Where is Dollar? Let's have some fun, girls. Let the party begin. I told you he was a liar. What? I don't know. Chin-chin. Yes. - Do you want to go? - Go to the bedroom. I'll take this one. Mr. Ling? Mr. Ling, you should go to bed. Hello. - Rasmus. - What? - Rasmus. - Yes. Frederik... Frederik. I cannot move. Frederik. What are you doing? I'm awake. - I can't move. - You killed him. What? Do you hear me? I can't move. - Shut the fuck up. He's dead. - What? Be quiet. Shut up. Stay still. - That's all I can do. - Get up. Listen to me, Frederik. I cannot move. I can't move. Frederik... Dollar. Dollar. Dollar? Dollar. Dollar? Dollar. Dollar? Dollar? Dollar! Don't make a sound. Shut the fuck up. Dollar, stop pulling! ACCOUNT TURNOVER: 2,400,000 DOLLARS ARE NOW AT YOUR DISPOSAL.
