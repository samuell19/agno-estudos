Piku Motion Is the Emotion Bhola, the laundry boy would have come, and cut the fruits and keep. Yes, ma'am. All I am saying is, Dad, just go and sit on the pot. It'll happen. How will it happen? I am still not feeling pressure. Count these. -Hey, Budhan! -Yes? Why didn't you give black currant with milk last night? I did give... This walking around won't help you. Just go and sit on the pot. I know my system better or you? -Budhan -Yes? -Make a note of 19 clothes. -Yes, ma'am. You're still here, dad? It won't happen just because you're saying! I'm saying it will! Go and try. It won't! All right then! You just don't want to listen to anyone. Breakfast and medicines are here. Eat after you're done. Look, I know that 'potty' feeling. Yesterday I sat on the pot for an hour. Please, Dad, no point. I'm already late for work. Give me the list. Listen, Piku. Piku. Call me before lunch. You're late again. Madam, I've been waiting here for 20 minutes. So am I lying then? No, madam. -Let's go. -Yes, ma'am. -Fast. -Yes, ma'am. Madam. Sir won't spare me. Tell your owner I don't need your taxi from tomorrow. All they know is how to fleece you. -Send a cup of tea inside. -Sure, sir. -Reema, PPT. -Yes, sir. Client is here. Yes, sir I know I'm late. Piku, just try not to argue today. Look I can't stand like a beggar in front of the client. I like to speak my mind. If you've issues with that then I am happy to not attend this meeting. You are meeting Aniket for lunch? Come on, not him. He's a jerk! -You can't be so desperate. -Yes, I am. So? Shall we? Syed, kept it inside. See, I get your point. My driver was trying to save other car, turned left. You were coming from behind in speed. Naturally it banged. Speed? Your driver was speeding! He hit and ran away. So how's this natural? -Sir, Piku madam had said... -Stay quiet. What else could this poor man have done? Who would cause an accident intentionally? This dent here... That was another lady driver. Oh really? Why do accidents happen with only you? -Look, don't deviate.. -What? Stick to the point. Is it always the other guy's fault? All I know that he has broken this. Oh hello... Settle the matter, or it will be a hit and run case. Exactly. You can't be so safe with the designs. Otherwise there is no point. -Yeah. -Sorry, sir. Ma'am, your father... What happened? -There's a message from him. -Read it. Read it! Quickly. "Day before I had Semi liquid motion." "Since then constipation and gas." "What should I do?" Will you say something? I am talking to you. I am talking to you. -What? -"Semi liquid motion first." "Then two days of gas and constipation." "What should I do?" Is this the message to leave at an office? Why? I think it's a serious health issue and we should discuss it. We could've discussed at home! We live in the same house. But you said you didn't want to talk to me. Fine.. You could've sent me a text. Why did you give it to the receptionist? But in the morning you told me you didn't want to talk! Didn't you say that? -This morning, dad.. -Didn't you? I've kept the lunch on the table, and I've have made Grandpa's dish. My dish? Or Moong pulses dish? Son of a pig! Go and keep lunch on the table. -On the Table? -What else did I say? I also said table. Dad, in the middle of my... Hey, hope you did not put salt in my food. Well how could I? You hid it again today. Open a new packet. Hey, greasing is good for motion. Stop being so difficult, dad. From last two days not a single piece has come out. I don't want to die of constipation! No one dies of constipation. Elvis Presley did. Don't look at me like that. His body was found in the bathroom. He must've been sitting on the commode. You Didn't keep the yogurt in the fridge? It's gone sour. Look, Piku, my problems are not small. When you'll be my age, you'll understand. I don't want to get to your age. You have problems everywhere in your body. Imaginary. Imaginary? Then? see this. What? See.. Hemoglobin 15. normal. Urine test normal. Diabetes negative. Kidney function normal. ECG normal. -Budhan! -Yes? When did reports come? Why did you give it to her? That's not the point, Dad. Mr. Srivastava asked for blood Count only. Then why did you get these extra tests done? There's nothing in the report. Look at your face. Reports are normal but you are not happy. It will be better if something comes out. Kidney or lung or diabetes or something. At least then, there will a solution to this house. Look, I've given you full freedom. -Don't talk to me like that! -What freedom? Tell me! I had to meet Aniket today for lunch but I am here with you. Is this how I am going to live my life? Discussing your shit? Don't bring my shit in between. Don't! And this your relationship status. Yeah, Syed? If you ask me, I think casual is fine. That works for me. He's just all the time imagining. Hypochondriac. Why are you here now? I want to talk to madam. She's not here. Go away. I know she's inside. -I told you she isn't, go! -Dad! Why are you so late today? I've fired her. She won't work for us anymore. I've left this job myself. Give me my dues and I'll leave. There is nothing due. -Dad, please. -You should leave. Go! Did he say something? When I mop the floor, he walks behind me with his dirty shoes checking if I'll steal something... So, so? What is so wrong in that? Three times a day I clean the toilet and he's still not satisfied. And today he crossed the limits. He said I've stolen the toilet cleaner. You think I'll do that? Then where did it go? One minute, dad. Did I drink it up? Nonsense! She's talking nonsense. Look he didn't mean that. He just... No, he's suspecting me all the time... ...Just pay my dues and I'll leave. I told you there's no balance. Fine, Piku... Her dues are calculated. In the drawer I've kept Rs 850. She didn't work for three days I've deducted that. See he's deducted three days salary. You didn't turn up on Sunday and Monday. -Third day you went for a movie. -Dad, please... -No, madam I was unwell... -Keep your salary. Don't clean the toilets from tomorrow. I'll do that. Take couple of days off, and think with a cool head. Day off? What are you doing, Piku? Keep quiet, dad! -No, I know this lady. -Dad, shut up. Let it be. Whichever house you get married in, I'll work there. But here, till the time he's here. Till the time? Till the time means? I'll be here forever. And even she will live here. You go... you go from here. I don't want to work... Goes on and on. -No one is going to give you a job. -I'm going. -I don't steal... -One minute... I am not a thief. If I'd to steal, I would steal diamonds, laptop, that keeps lying there. I've not had a good motion since morning, and on top of that dealing with this lady. Happy? Happy? You should be happy. At least, there won't be a thief in the house. She was the main cause of his BP. You keep quiet. Why are you worried? She'll come back after two days saying sorry. No, no... That's not the point. It's the fifth maid, we've changed in two months. We live in a society, dad. We need to maintain good relations with people. What relationship, Piku? Take cleaning lady for dinner? Don't talk nonsense, dad. What is your problem, Piku? Budhan is here to work. When your mother got me here, she said I'll do a respectable job. Fine then, you start going to my office from tomorrow. Hey, Piku? What? Relax! And where are you going again? -Serve him dinner on time. -Piku... I'm eating out. -Piku... -She left. Yes, Aniket. I'll be there at 9:00. I am not in touch with anyone. But do you remember Rhea? She had that funny hairstyle. -Well, anyway she got married. -Oh! Yeah, it's surprising. Anyway, what's happening with you? Usual that Gurgaon project. 98.8. -Check this. -As if my checking will make it high. Shut up. What was it in the morning? 98.4. At 12 PM, it was 98.6. After that? After that 98.8. See it's increasing. Fever? 98.8. That's normal. Okay. I'll call him. Everything okay? Yeah. -Sorry, just one second. -Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Uncle, Dad ate Bryonia twice. He said potty was hard along with mucus. No, no later he said... it looked like mango pulp. Yes. And 98.8 fever. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Should we order dinner? No, actually... I'm not so hungry now. Why? No. Just why don't you... why don't you go ahead? I'll just drop Piku and come back home. Yeah, okay, bye-bye, bye. He hasn't seen any of Satyajit Ray's films. And he doesn't vote! I was somehow tolerating him. You were right. He's such a jerk! -Did dad call you up? -Yes. Why did you react like this? Like what? I said dad called, so you said "Hun". Right, I asked if dad called you, and you said 'Yes' so I said 'Hun'. so? Who reacts like that? What is Hun? Dad called me, so you should say okay. What is Hun? You said yes, so I said Hun. No, you didn't say... You said Hun. Come on, Piku.. I just said 'Hun', so what's wrong in it? Piku mentioned yellow pulp? Right, but then later... It became greenish. It was greenish, not black... Yellowish green.. Why don't you sit with a shade card? What percent of green, how much percent of yellow... Sit is shit. Mind your business! But Grandpa, my heart says one day you'll have a great motion. -Just the way you desire. -Yeah. Then I will die. Happy. satisfied. Why talk about death in the morning? Why can't he talk something positive? What is so negative about death? I am changing the medication, dear. You can alternate with this one. And remember one thing. Where there is a will there is a way. And outside is the only way. Pappu, you leave for Motibaug. -Don't be late. -sure, sir. God knows when the winters will come. This summer has been harsh. I haven't caused it. Did I say it's because of you? Then why are you telling me? Because you're sitting here. Imagine I am not here and keep quiet. It's useless talking to you. So don't talk. Go home. And don't come here from tomorrow. Why should I not come? I am trying to work. Such big ego even after been thrown out of job? Why do you keep reminding me of that? When I'm trying to forget, why do you rake up my old wound? But that's the truth. Himachal Taxi Stand. Yes? No, no I understand Rosy, but Piku madam said she didn't want taxi from us. So I didn't send anyone. Fine, I'll send one. Hey whose turn is it for that madam from Chitranjan Park? Why are you guys silent? She's a regular client, you'll have to tolerate her. So she insists on driving fast doesn't mean you do that. Car will bang. Don't you have your own mind? If no one wants to go then why are you forcing them? One minute, don't you talk like union leaders here. What? Nannu, go take the car. I am aware what you and your daughter are up to. Why? Ritu is not your sister? Whatever it is, just watch out. -Excuse me! -Yeah, you both. -Aunt, how are you? -Fine. -Here she is. -Hey Bhaskor Da. How are you? Did you pass Motion? -Hello, ma'am. -Hello. These sweet pills won't help you much, start Allopathy. -Illiterate. -Hi! Happy birthday, sister. So tell me, what's the latest? Nothing... usual. How was your vacation? Shimla was fantastic. You must go once and enjoy yourself. Mutton is smelling good. Anyways where is uncle? Why such a swollen face? What happened? She isn't married yet that is why all this. Nothing serious I guess, or am I missing something, Piku? I mean, I am not saying I want to take a long holiday, But just for a day or two I can go somewhere. Piku's right. Every normal person needs a break. -For relaxation. -Oh, nonsense! People aren't relaxed in their own homes with their own families but they don't mind spending on a train or a plane ticket to get to some far away hotel and using some else's used beddings to feel relaxed. Travel companies are to be blamed. -all in the mind. -I am telling you, find a nice boy and... Isn't your sex life active? Your partner Syed? It's a need. Right... It's a need. But that's not a permanent solution. Why don't you both get married? Aunt, I don't know. I'm not even sure about him. Again that useless topic. Marriage is a bad word in our house. People with low IQ get married. You mean I am low IQ? My sister was low IQ? -In this whole world everyone... -Hi. -Piku... -...is married is low IQ? -Hope you are good. -Good... Your Telegraph. Last 30 days. Ah! Lovely! Nothing like Kolkata news. Don't change the topic. -Don't waste your time. -Again? Getting married, looking after your husband, to be together in good times and bad, is it low IQ? There's no salt in this? He hid the salt jar even today. To take care of BP, best to avoid. But we don't have BP! So stop hiding like this. Again your changing the topic. Was my sister low IQ? Not just constipation, dad has problems with women too. Not women but their mentality is what I can't stand. Your sister too, all her life, she just wanted to please me. That was her only purpose. No aim for herself. I wanted her to be independent but no. She surrendered herself in my service. So what's wrong with that? Everything is wrong! Throwing away your identity, your knowledge, respect, brain in the fire while taking the seven vows and then leading your life. Well that is a low IQ decision. I don't want Piku to take this decision. But don't say this today on sister's birthday at least. When she was alive, she was not happy. When she was dying she was not happy and even after dying isn't happy. You're really insensitive, dad. Piku, she was my wife. I can say anything. But she loved you. I also loved her and still do. Then why are you criticizing mom? Because I am a critical person. Brutal and honest. I am entitled to think whatever I want to about her. But that doesn't mean that I don't love her. This shirt that I am wearing, she gifted me on my birthday. So I am wearing it for her today. Piku, find a right man and get married. She has to look after me. Leaving father's home after marriage, and living in another house, taking care of that new one, how foolish! -I gave birth to you, didn't I? -Yes. Tell me, I gave birth to you. -Yes, dad -Then. I never left you and went, so now I am your child. You do the same. I completely agree with Bhaskor Da's philosophy. How did my sister tolerate you all these years. No wonder she died early. You only must've given her BP. I give BP to you, to Piku, even to Srivastava. Did you all die? -Would you like some ice cream? -I'll have some. Obviously. Why I did I get it then? Just ignore what Piku says. She doesn't mean it. Her nature... No, she should... I'm giving these bills to the accounts. -Just get the payment released. -Of course. By the way, how's your mother? Don't even know how I was born in that family? Just waiting to get out of there. Anyway, tell your partner to mend her ways or get used to travelling in a Metro. Why don't you tell her? Hello, Piku. Piku. -Hi. -All well? Yeah. I know because of my drivers... It's fine. I don't have time for this discussion. So when should I come? For? To discuss this driver issue. You had a word with Syed? Yeah, but... So then it's fine. See you. Bye. You need to be a bit easy with Piku. I am really worried for her. Why did you get married thrice? If you were so worried. -Excuse me? -After Piku's mother passed away, Piku needed you. So I should've shifted here with Eisha in your house. Gotten married to you? Because my sister was no more? Only you can have such idiotic thoughts. Piku and Eisha were never your priority. All I am saying is that and that is very sad. Is this why you don't like me? No. I've enough reasons to not like you. But, don't you feed this marriage nonsense in Piku's mind, don't. Coming... Grandpa doesn't want to meet you. Just leave. Tell him I'm not here to discuss the selling of Kolkata house. Then why are you here? To know the condition of my stomach? Good evening, sir. How are you? Actually, I met a builder yesterday. He is ready to negotiate. So, I spent my own money for the flight ticket. I called Piku. She asked me to come. -You know my decision. -Sir, try and understand. Then why you come again. -Go! -It's a golden opportunity. All these things must be done while you're still here. Then you can peacefully... Listen, Budhan. -Yes, grandpa. -You haven't made tea for him yet? -I am about to... -No need, no need! Just shut the door when this man leaves, and don't open it if he comes back again. Irritating man. Oh, that's an insult! I made so much of effort to negotiate with the builder. Is this how you treat me? I'll tell Piku. -She's practical, she'll sell. -Tell her. Darn him. I rang the bell for an hour. Then the door opened. 126/88. It's normal. How are you, sir? Very serious. BP is normal. This is not a joke, Piku. -Please sit. -Greetings, ma'am. That idiot, Nobendu... He again came to discuss selling the house. I will not sell that house. -That old house is a pain! -What? Pain! I have told you before I will not sell Champa Kunj! This year I will go to Kolkata! I have decided. End of discussion! Fine, then end this discussion. Tell Nobendu not to come again. Why get so affected? Affected? Of course, I'll be I am an emotional man. If you were emotional, my sister would've been happy. Listen you, Dutta sisters I know your habit of blame game and I worry Piku is also becoming like one of you. What your Banerjees are like well I also know that. That Moni Banerjee, your aunt. Whole day she roams around in just a flimsy night gown. -That too without a bra! -Really, aunt? Mom, even you do the same. Hey, shut up! I only do that when I am alone at home! Anyway, what's the point in getting BP checked 100 times in a day? Whatever this Nobendu came and said and you started panicking? These are all age related problems. What's so abnormal in it? -But what if my BP shoots up? -So? Everyone has some issue or the other in their lives. Just for a day if you haven't crapped. There isn't any need for this drama! Nothing has happened to you. You are just simply going through menopause. Even men go through menopause. Oh ignore what she's saying. -One minute -What? Menopause me? No way, here take a look. He's Asaako. He cycled even at the age of 99. -Died just last week -How did he die? Heart attack, cancer, brain damage? Nothing's written here. He who cycles even at the age of 99, what can he suffer from? Hey! Stop, stop, stop... Let me try... -Is this your bicycle? -Yes, sir. I want to take a small round. Sir, I'll be late. -Oh no! -wait, wait. -Be careful. -Just a few minutes more. I need to go to other houses too, sir. Yeah, I know it's okay. Madam will scold me. Careful.. -Don't push I am trying to balance. -Careful... Hey, don't push, it'll turn. Careful... What... Sanju is coming to have a talk. Now. Go change your clothes or go to the stand. Why, what's wrong with these clothes? And in any case, he's not coming to take you back. Look, what he's saying mom. At least, we can ask for a settlement? Well, he's already left you so what are you going to settle? Now earn live your life respectfully. You're just frustrated and you don't want even me to be happy. If you were so worried about your happiness then why steal in-law's ring for mom? It wasn't your ring. What does he have anyway? Do you even know what honesty means? Treachery never brings happiness do you get that? As if you've been righteous always. How and why were you thrown out from your job? Nonsense! Hello. Again? Honda. Where? The taxi's been hit again? Who was the client? Piku again? Three drivers have left us already. Hello, Syed, look, now this another taxi has also been hit. No, we need to sort this out, my friend. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. -Played after ages. -Yeah. -Going back to Saudi? -Not again. Ah, Piku is here. I thought you are going to bunk. It not my fault. Shall we leave? My driver must've delayed you, isn't it? You guys chat, I'll just get my laptop. Well, whatever it may be these are known drivers. You're safe with them. They listen to you. They're also scared of you. Nothing like that. So what about that Honda case? I was getting late for a meeting so I asked him to speed up. Normal speeding up. He banged. This time again you told him not to stop after banging and even if he did, Delhi Police blames driver no matter whoever's fault it may be. You mean I am making them break the rules? No, no, I have no problems with that, break them. As long as no one gets hurt. In any case, I send the damages to your office, so it's okay. No, it's not okay. I can take an auto. I can manage myself. Come on, Piku. He's just saying that he has some decent drivers working for him. So it's my fault? See the point is, everything is mutual. You don't like them. They don't like you. Did they say this? No, but does it matter when it's the truth. It means... Got to leave. Okay. There won't be a need to take an auto. See you. He's rude. Don't be so judgmental. Obviously, he's your friend, you're going to take his side. It's not like that. Sit. You know what? -What? -I need a break. What? I won't come to office for a few days. But we have a meeting... Piku, how am I supposed to run this firm? Piku, listen.. To Saket. -Piku! -Yes? There is no water in the flush. Budhan, how many times I have told you. Not to put the tea leaves in the basin? I heard, you're driver left the job. Why not keep another? Miser. We're misers. Okay? Hey Piku, come, the whole gang is here. No, I can't come. You guys carry on. Hello. I don't need your taxi. I'll be ashamed if you're taking an auto. I said I don't need your taxi. I'll call you if I need it. Thank you. We can always sort out this driver issue. Gosh. Okay... thank you. -Piku... -Yes. We've to go for Chhobi's party in the evening. Have you booked the taxi? Here it comes... Yes.. Himachal Taxi Service. C 124 CR PARK. 8 PM. Sharp. See I told you, you'll need... -Hi... -Thank you. -Thank you, dear. -Here.. -Hi... -Happy anniversary. Thank you. Bhaku Da, you must have a drink with me today. -Aunt, he can't have this. -Here... That is why I said no. It's my anniversary. Come on. He cannot handle all this. Then you don't know me! Yeah, that's more like it. Cheers. Unless the food is... -That guy... -Just like... Sourob. Sourob. -Excuse me, ladies. -Come, come. -Hi. -Hi. -You know Bhaskor, right? -Yeah, yeah. And she's Bhaskor Da's daughter. -Hi. -Hi. Piku. Sourob has his own business in San Francisco and he's single. You are planning fourth wedding? -No... -Sunita. Hi! Hi! So what do you do? I have my own art gallery. Nice.. And you? I actually work at an architecture firm. Do you plan to marry? -Dad.. -I.. I am single, if I find a nice girl, why not! I mean a nice girl. But she is very moody. Like me. And she's not a virgin. Right, Piku? -Dad... -No, no, no. What do you mean by 'nice'? She has her own business. She's financially independent, sexually independent. Need based, just looking for emotional partnership. So is she 'nice' according to you? -Dad... -I mean it depends. -Depends on? -I am leaving. Where? -Aunt will drop you home. -Aunt. Yeah, so... what were you saying? I said it depends... Wow.. There.. No, no let me be. Dad, it's late. Sister... I tried waking you up at 4 AM, but you didn't open the door, so I called for Dr. Srivastava. Nothing to worry. A bit of shallow breathing, pulse drop. That's it. Dr. Mukherjee has given him medicines. He'll be fine. Right now, he's okay. At his age, we should not take any risks. Get his tests done. It's a must. Sure. Today. How are you, young man? How's everyone at home? All okay, uncle. What happened? Nothing serious. He just enjoyed a bit too much. Indigestion. -So.. -It's all because of her. Okay. He'll be fine. Yeah, cancel my meetings. I won't come. Budhan, keep the lunch simple today. Put the pan. Where? On my head! Obviously on the burner. I'll go to. I'll go to Kolkata. Piku.. That idiot Nobendu... -I won't sell Champa Kunj. -How are you? -O mother... -Dad.. I will go to Kolkata. Dad. No, uncle, I am not worried for him. In fact it makes no difference to him. If he wants to go he'll go, he doesn't care about anybody else. What will I do? Now do I write on a stamp paper that I will not die during this trip. Will that be fine? Look at his health. Forget logic. From here to airport and from there to Kolkata. -It's too much Dada. -Flight? Who said I'll take a flight? -I'll get palpitations on it. -Give me some tea. BP fluctuates at that height. Bathrooms are claustrophobic palpitation, nervousness is bad for my condition. I am not going by train, certainly. Train? Never. never. Never. This train movement shakes up everything inside. I get constipation. That is not a good option. Just five days back you've gotten up from bed. You could've died. It was my marriage anniversary. Why did he have to drink and dance? And then he comes home... drinks.. Budhan, why did you give him the drink? Piku, you also didn't bother. This old man has gone senile! Look you don't interfere. No one is asking you. You're my sister's husband that's why I am concerned. But your sister is no more. So keep quiet. Hey Srivastava... There is one way. I've an idea. I was thinking exactly the same. You might get tired, but then you can stop anywhere and walk. Correct. Correct. Correct. That way things will be in control. -According to my convenience. -Yes.. As in? As in... Nothing. Done. Decided! Who'll drive that madam from CR park to Kolkata? Day after morning at 4.30 AM. Whose duty is it? She's not bad at heart. Dhani Raam... Take the car that has a carrier on top. -Here, take this. -Give it to me. Here... -Budhan. -Yes? Take out two suitcases kept in the garage. Okay. Budhan... Yes? All this will not fit in one suitcase. Need another one. He should be here any moment. Where's your Driver? He must be on his way. He may have stopped for some fuel perhaps. I've been calling you since 4 AM! It's 4:30. I'll check. The number you're calling is either switched off. The number you're calling is either switched off. Please try after some time. I told you my father will be travelling too. He's an old man. Let me talk to him and I am not old! Sorry, Piku, can't get through driver just now... We've been waiting for 2 hours with our luggage all packed and you are telling me there is no driver. Look, look, I am trying. Just give me some time. If you don't know how to do business then why did you even take the booking? How's your shouting going to help? You just don't talk in a civilized manner. Reason, none of the drivers want to go with you. Do you understand this? You should've told me the truth! I didn't knew after listening your name, the drivers will run away! God. The number you've dialled is either switched off or out of coverage area. Please try after some time. Oh I thought you guys would've left by now. -What happened? -Driver didn't turn up. Good. Now take a flight later. -Useless plans end up like this only. -Did we ask you? I thought passing motion before this journey will give me some relief on the way. But no, it's all hardened inside. Been on hold for 10 minutes now. These airline idiots. But why are you calling flight? Call the driver. Piku. Piku. None of the drivers are ready to go. So is this the luggage? Is he the driver? Budhan, keep the luggage in the car. Is this the time to come? -Because of you my stomach... -All this.. -Stomach? -What is your owner's name? Dad, he is the owner. He is the owner. Oh, so he's that same irritating owner you told me about? Well if the owner is like him, then obviously people under him will also be as useless. Keep this up. Do you know, mister? Because of you my daughter is going through -so much stress. -Dad, please. No, wait a minute. What is your name? Rana Choudhary. -Choudhary? -Put the brown on the top. -Are you a Bengali? -No, no, UP. Thakur. UP? Where in UP? Sandila. District Hardoi. Oh that place is famous for its sweets. Get us a kilo or two when you go there next time. OK. You are going to take us. Where is your license? -What license? -Driving license? -Yeah, I have... -Check if the taxi has a carrier or not. Keep both the suitcase in the front seat if there's no place. Where is it? Had I known there'll be so much luggage, I would've got a mini bus. How? Do you have any medical issue? Eye sight? Night blindness? Day blindness? -Glasses? -Dad, do all this later. Sir, everything is fine. -Why a medical test now? -Any bad habit? -Piku, have you kept water? -Cigarette? Drinking? You know, drinking, driving, zipping. Then accident. Has it happened to you ever? As if he's going to tell you? -What a question? -No, fortunately, no, sir. Are you speaking the truth? I don't want to go with a liar! Sir, we're already late. I think we must leave. Remaining questions you can ask me on the way. I am an honest man. Can I have it back? Yeah. By the way, sir, your name? My name? why? We've to travel together till Kolkata, so... I am Bhaskor. Bhaskor Banerjee. Yes. Bengali. -Bengali? -Yes. I think you all must leave now. Don't think you're free now. Please, what will I do without your company? Anyway, we'll talk over the phone every day. -Bye. Take care. -Bye, bye. Excuse me, sir. -Choudhary... -Yes? This too needs to be taken. Hey, Budhan. Now where will this fit? Anywhere. Bye. Budhan. Sit behind. What are you exchanging the seats for? I'll sit here. What route are you planning to take? Yamuna Expressway then Agra bypass. I am asking up till Kolkata. It's marked in Red. Noida, Yamuna Expressway, Agra bypass, Firozabad, Kanpur. Allahabad Bypass, Banaras, Mugalsarai, Gaya, Assansol, Durgapur, Kolkata. Oh God! That's some distance. It's far! How much time will it take? Of course, it's far . 1500 kilometres. I didn't ask in kilometre. I asked you time. 40 to 45 hours. Could be more also. Hope you don't intend to drive after dark? Why? Night halt? Haven't thought about it. Maybe Banaras. Well.. Hey, sit on the seat. Idiot! -Yes, I'll send the vehicle. -Should I come? Go with him. -Where's the toilet? -Coming. Hey, Budhan... Come. -Fill up the tank. -Yes, sir. Keep saying. Yeah, yeah, fine. Done. What was that? Where's dad? He is coming. What is the next stop? Not before two hours. After that wherever we find a decent place we'll stop for breakfast. Two hours? That's too far! This is why I didn't want us to drive down. Unnecessarily you force your decisions. No, I never forced. I said. You agreed. And you also... Yes? When the driver didn't turn up, I almost decided we'll go by flight. Who told you to come last minute? And at least you should've called up before coming? What? Why are you dragging me into this? It's the limit. I didn't load your luggage forcibly. I would've dropped you at the airport had you asked me to. Amazing! -We can go back even now if you want. -Go back? Who said about going back? -What? Tell me. -He said... -Who? -Look, mister. Don't you interfere in our family matter. In my house I decide everything, got it? But this is a car. That too his. I know it. Donkey! Here... Press this. And Piku, you said you wanted an 'adventure trip' so this is it. Adventurous trip. You wanted to go out of Delhi. Here it is. So enjoy sing song. What was that song? "What if this road never ends?" "How will it be, tell me my dear?" "What if this road never ends?" "How will it be, tell me my dear?" Tell me. -You tell me. -No, no you tell me. You.. You tell... So Mr. non Bengali Choudhary. Do you know the meaning of this song? This path... this road that we are on, if it never ends, how will that be? Well then sing another song, that has a better meaning. To appreciate good music is also an art. Whoever wants to do whatever can do it here. We won't stop here for long. Where are you? You're asking as if you really are worried for me. Why aren't you telling? -Kolkata. -Kolkata. -What happened? -Bathroom's very dirty. It's morning hours. -People must've used it. -Why don't you tell me? God knows when will Grandpa use it. Don't start now. Keep down the phone. All the driver are sitting on my head. I'll handle them and don't take any bookings. -Haven't you informed at home? -No. So what is your father's real problem? Nothing. A weak stomach... that's it. Then tell him to do it fast. We need to leave. In any case we have that 'throne'. Whenever he feels the urge, we'll stop. He doesn't eat unless he... I got it. There he is. Not looking happy though. Did the army win the war? A bit. There were so many mosquitoes that. I could not concentrate. You don't have to meditate. This is the only job that happens on its own. Without any effort. Bill! -So much butter. -Here. Checked? Yes, sir, all safe. When I got the call, it seemed you need to reach Kolkata today. But the way family is going now as if out for a picnic forget 48, we'll not reach Kolkata even in 72 hours. What was the need of stopping there to buy bangles? She could have bought them at Kolkata. She has got no sense of time. I have no sense of time. You're not going to let me get married. Let me enjoy these bangles at least. Seriously? Most would get their daughters married just when they're born and he doesn't want you to get married. That's strange. This doesn't happen even in western culture. Western culture is not the benchmark of progress. We were always ahead of them. Always. That Rani Laxmi Bai. Sarojini Naidu and Kadimbini Ganguly. Vijay Laxmi Pandit. Annie Besant. All these fine women spent their whole life in serving the country. And all she wants to do is please a boy? How many times I have told you Annie Besant wasn't an Indian. Still she fought for our country's independence! But all these women were married. Yes, but with a purpose. Marriage is not wrong, but it must have a purpose. All that a husband wants is that wife should serve food during the day and sex at night. But is that what a woman is made for? No! That is why marriage without any purpose is low IQ. Fine, but not all women are nice and simple. You don't know... Many of them are very manipulative and scheming. What does one do then? Women should be scheming, it's not wrong. Because man is like that. That's why it's alright for her to be scheming. You understood. What are you looking at her for? No, aunt. Yes, the driver is fine. Hmm. About half way. Listen, they're not bad people. No, sometimes that man talks sense then suddenly he loses it. -You want slippers now? -Yes. Why do you want it now? I feel I just got carried away and now I am stuck between this crazy father-daughter duo. As if you had a great life at home. I might just run away in between. I am telling you. Gosh! Where is he? No, still too far. Not even half way. I don't know if they really want to get there or they're just on a joyride. Hey, look there I had kept my slippers in the bag. In the suitcase. Hello... -Found? -Can't hear, bad signal. Hello... Hello... Hello. -In the drawing room... -What's this? Hello... No, I was saying... Are you planning to kill him? Mad or what? It's his. Oh is he planning a murder? -Perhaps for safety. -Safety? What can we do to him? No, no this is very dangerous. Hey, Piku, it is very dangerous. Hey... where? One minute, I'll call you later. What's this? Oh maybe, the driver has kept it for safety. We're on the highway. For safety. So, keep it inside. Listen... Don't you know what's kept in your car and what's not? You are lying. You are lying. You must've only hidden it. Sir, I don't even know how to use it. No, no, no! I won't travel with you. -What? -What are you doing? -No, I can't trust somebody... -Don't create... -...who has a knife! -...fuss in middle of the road. -Please uncle, trust me. Trust me. -I am not your uncle. I am not your uncle. -I'll just not go. -At least.... First throw this knife, otherwise I'm not going. How can I throw it? No you throw it. Take it in your hand and throw. I can't... It was kept in the car. So you agree it was kept in the car. I had told you I don't want to travel with a liar. -I am not a liar. -You are a liar. -I can't throw it. -You are a liar... Whole journey is left. There's a girl with us. How can I throw it? Girl? She's my daughter. How can I throw it? She's also my responsibility. -How you are responsible. No, you have to. -I won't. -You will otherwise I am not going. -Get in. -I won't go... -Fine. -Okay. Now sit inside. -What? No, you tell him to pick this up and throw. Throw it, otherwise I am not going. I am not throwing it. What happened? Did the tire get punctured? Why don't you throw it? There's nothing else here. Relax. So you must be having another source of income as well. Sorry? -Another source of income? -None. Are you sure? Dad. Since when are you running this taxi business? It was my father's business actually, now I am running it. He put in the business to earn more money. I had a job earlier. Where? Saudi... Civil construction. After becoming engineer you are doing taxi business? Sad... In interview I was told, its a project management job. But once I got there on construction site I was made to do security management. Why didn't you come back? My passport was them with a contract of two years! Who gives the passport... That's the way it is. They don't give it back. So then? I had a tiff with my supervisor, even though I was right. But still, I lost my job. Hey, Piku your Paanchu babu. What's that? What 'Babu'? Nothing. If you know you were right then why that sullen face? Why do you feel sad when you were fired? All honest men in the world have faced similar consequences. It's nothing new. Well, neither will you gain my sympathy nor try to gain Piku's. Right? So you came back? Yeah and handling this taxi business since then. Yes, Srivastava. She's checking. 130/90. Yes... 130/90. Yes, I have Crateagus. Fine then. -Budhan, get me Crateagus. -Here. Taansen sang Raga Deepak. All the lamps lit up. He sang Raga Malhaar. Well it rained. So why didn't anyone sing a different raga, to clear stomach. Like 'Raga motion'. What do you say? Here's what I have. Indian Basil and mint leaves. Boil them in water and drink it, you'll be fine. How do you know? Will you boil these or should I throw them? -No, wait. Budhan. -Yes? Take this. Boil it and get it. Trust me, whatever is inside, it'll come out. Okay. Is this the only topic that you both discuss the whole day? -Both of you. -Yeah. I should've found out before taking the booking. Well.. Prayers to the God at 5 AM and check out at 8. Lakhan, take them to room number 112. -Budhan -Yes? -Keep the medicines ready. -Yes. I'll see you in a bit, dad. Piku? Where? I'm coming. This place is famous for its desserts. Would you like to have some? Am I disturbing you? Can we sit quietly please? Yeah, sure. You were screaming at someone in the morning? Not you. Better not! I would've thrown you out of the car. How would your dad have gone to Kolkata then? I would've driven. Really? Well, had I known this earlier I could've stretched for a bit. Now you drive tomorrow. -I don't like driving. -Why? Women in Saudi are fighting with the government for their driving rights, getting jailed too for same. And you say you don't like driving... That's weird.. Not really... Those countries are like that. Yeah, but your country isn't. Moreover driving liberates a woman. Are you saying all this to impress me? Or you really do respect women? Isn't it written on my face? I'm not talking about that. Well, you were arguing with some Ritu this morning. Yes. My sister. And my mother, another devious woman. I swear, you can ask Syed. Yes, dad? Okay, I'll be there. Tell me something. You're really his daughter. I mean... Yes, I am 'his' daughter. And 10 times more strange weird, irritating, annoying... No, I didn't mean that way... No, I know what you mean. I know it's weird, it's okay. But I am like that. More. -Hello, hello... -There's no room that's vacant. Excuse me, room. I need a room. All occupied. That Bengali family just walked in, I'm a part of that. -For me... -Not here... Go. Which room number is that Bengali family in? 112. Piku... What happened? There aren't any rooms available. Apparently a lot of tourist. I know, Budhan is also sleeping in the car. Hey, listen I am the owner, not your driver that I go and sleep next to him. That dormitory is infested with mosquitoes. I'll die there. It's midnight already. Please go and sleep. I can't go now. I am not sleeping outside. Is this the only hotel in Banaras? Piku... -You behave as if I am... -Go... ...barging in your personal bedroom. Fine. I'll leave but this is not.. I am taking the car. Your luggage is there and your father's throne as well. Okay. Ta-ta, bye-bye. What time will you be here in the morning? Have no idea, not sure if I'll come at all. Listen. Say. Sleep here. See that's what I was saying. But on a chair? Shush! Now what is it? Switch off the light. Can I change? -Can you not make any sound? -Right. That basil water did nothing. Sir, do you sit Indian style or western style? Yes? Do you sit Indian style or western? Huh? What do you mean? There aren't any toilets with Indian style these days. That's the issue. It's the most scientific way for excretion. Rana, please! Stop this nonsense discussion. No, no, it's not nonsense. Did our forefathers ever have this constipation problem? Just try and remember. No, Never, Isn't it? No, I didn't get you. This constipation problem wasn't there in olden days, isn't it? Right. Sir, let me explain you. It's a very simple formula! -Now this is our stomach. -Yes. Our intestines go like this. See. This is our stomach. This turns here and after that makes this question mark kind of thing. Here. And when we... one minute. Sit like this and it puts pressure on our stomach. And intestines get pressed. And whatever waste material is there in the pipeline, that slowly comes out. No need to put pressure. It happens on its own. Are you a doctor? -And aren't we getting late? -It's a common sense. Can't leave him like this, can we? Sir, should we try again? -Where? Here? -Not here. What if I fall down? I want to reach Kolkata safely. Dad has arthritis. He cannot do this stunts. -Budhan will help. -Yes? I can also come inside. Dad, what's wrong with you? You cannot climb this! This is western style. How will I squat on it? -Let me help you. -Dad what if you fall? -Wait. Wait Hey Budhan... -Why did you give him an idea? -No... -Come here. Fine... when you're done with this circus, call me. Sir, let her go. We will try. -Please hold my hands. -Sure. Yes. Okay. Now you are ready. I will have to aim. Go away you both, I need to take off my night pants. Should I also? Yes, go! -Budhan! -Will you manage alone. Absolutely. Done? Not satisfactorily, but at least got something new to try. Don't think you can impress him or me with your home remedies. We know everything about constipation. Oh, yeah obviously. Grandpa's been lying still for a while. Should I check him? Keep quiet! He's resting. There's no better place then Banaras for last rites. Shut up. Just check on him, we can still get back to Banaras. Hey, why are you driving? And why are you speeding? I am not. Look in front, look in front. Oh God. -Relax and sing that earlier path song. -Relax, dad. -You should be there... -Sing the path song... -We're paying you to drive, not sit. -I know how to drive. -She's driving fine. -I know how to drive. Piku, you've never driven on a highway. This is how accidents happen, dad. Keep quiet. - Quiet.. But what if she bangs... I don't want to come under a truck like a dog or a cat. I don't like unnatural deaths. I don't like that. Hey, stop, Stop the car. Slow... slow... Hey... It doesn't matter what you like or what you don't. Whenever it's time, you'll die. On a road, in a hospital. Death and shit come unannounced, anytime anywhere. Okay? I disagree! God! Do you know patience is a must for a good driver? I was just testing. That's all. Come. Come. Let's go. Who all stay in Kolkata? Uncle. Aunt. Actually my mother, dad and I, we used to stay there earlier. In any case one leg of Bengalis is always in Kolkata. Yeah, but I mean... I feel totally at home in Delhi also. Yeah, but one does have connections with the place one belongs to. -Correct. Correct. -Yes. What? But there is nothing for me, dad. Few relatives. I have no connection with them and that house. Which you want to sell off but I won't let you. Are you going to sell off your home? Yes? Don't know. I had already kept it ready. Hey Budhan... Where did its cell go? Cell? I gave it to you. No, it was in your hand when we stopped at that roadside place for dinner. -Is it? -Yes. -Turn back the car. Turn it back. -What's wrong? Turn back the car. What? My ear plug cell has gone weak. I think I've left it behind where we'd stopped. Hey why are you still driving? U-turn, U-turn. We'll be in Kolkata in a bit. Nobody is talking to you, mister. Do as I say. I'm sure you have enough battery that can last you till there. -Don't waste time unnecessarily. -Unnecessary? Oh, unnecessary! This ear whistles due to weak battery. Strange sounds come out of here. Is it unnecessary? Why do you think I am a burden on you? I am not a burden! Look! I can do everything on my own. Alright? -Dad, please, you... -No, no. you be quiet! And you.. you are charging us. If you don't listen to me, I won't care whether you're an owner or a driver. I can take bus also. Do you know? I am fit. I'm not dependent on anybody. Nobody. -Unnecessary! -Hold on a second! Why have you stopped here? Fine. You can take the bus. Stopping every now and then even my patience is running out. Please mind your language. No, I have not said anything wrong. And what's with this burden thing? I wonder why parents feel satisfied in emotionally blackmailing their kids. If you were a burden. You would've been sitting in Delhi. She wouldn't have cared to take you all the way to Kolkata. So close your eyes and sit quiet for some time. Sky won't fall if you don't hear some words. If we keep going like this, we will take forever to reach. Okay, shall we? What if on the way I feel like passing motion then? I'll stop the car. Keep your throne on the other side of the road. You can do what you need to. Alright? Good. Alright. Two hours more. -Sorry. -Sleep. Sure? Will wake you up once we're there. Thank you. Ma'am, they've arrived. They've arrived. -Hey, Binod! -Brother! Come. Come. How are you, Binod? Come, come. All okay? -Hello, aunt. -Uncle, you've lost weight. You're all grown up. Champa Kunj. -Hi, aunt. Sorry to wake you up. -Sudha, Sudha.. Here I come. No, no, whole night we were just awake. -Brother, you must be very tired? -I am fine. Get the luggage. -Nothing's changed here. -And whose idea was... ...it to do this road journey? Gosh! You need a heart to do that. Take this into that room. Rana, come. Uncle, he's Rana Choudhary. Greetings, Mr. Choudhary. Please sit. Hey Binod, he's not Bengali. He is not Bengali. How are you? He's the owner of Himachal Tourist Taxi stand. His driver didn't come, so he drove us. Oh, that means Delhi people aren't as bad as we think them to be here. Please don't mind. Not her fault. Well, that is the perception about Delhi people. So, Piku... Get that chair in then I'll leave. Where? Where? You can't be going back to Delhi right now. No, no, no. You must be tired. Go tomorrow morning. Go in the morning. No it's fine really. I'll leave. No one asked you. -Budhan. -Yes. Where have you kept my luggage? -In that room down there. -Downstairs. No, keep it up stairs in that room. Push it there. Not there! Keep it straight. Keep it straight. Keep it there. Where did that chair come from? That's grandpa's commode. Don't touch it. The whole feel of this house has changed because brother's here. Yeah, but Piku... Don't know what she has grown up to be. First, she stays with her aunt Chhobi, plus single. -Hello... -Living in Delhi. Yes, Nobendu, right... He has not told me anything. Why? Oh, okay. -What happened? -Nobendu is saying, brother has come to fix the house deal. I am not surprised. Must've done sitting in Delhi. It can't be true. I warned you, but you shouted at me. Now see for yourself. You respect him so much, but for him, we are nobody! You're over-reacting.. I don't think it's anything to worry. How's Dr. Srivastava? He will miss you. I don't think so. Dad just forces him to come every day. -I never force anybody, never. -There... Mr. Choudhary. -Join us. -Hi.. Pass me some pepper, Piku. I had no idea that your bowel problem had become so chronic? I don't think it's in our family. -Of course it is! -No.. Our father had it! But how would you remember? You were busy in fooling around with life. -Fun women... all that. -If he was fooling around, were the elders just watching the show? And when sister-in-law and almost decided to get him married to her sister Chhobi then what was the need to come and see me? Final paper, but no one cared! Mom just expressed it to grandma that it's fun if two brothers are married to two sisters. But it's not that she didn't love you when you came. You were not even born then, Piku. How would you know? All I know is when mom was in the hospital, she said whenever I'd get married, you'll do the rituals on her behalf. Not aunt Chhobi. After mom, you are like a mother to me. Why dig the old graves? She's come here after so many years. -But what did I say... -No, no. Listen... Don't stop her. She's right. This frustration is not right. It causes... -...you know what.. -Negativity. Right... Negativity and that causes indigestion and then... Constipation? Amazing! How do you connect everything with the stomach? Because everything is connected to the stomach! A person's emotion depends on his motion. This is all your nonsense theory in your own head. It's not that your constipated all the time? Why are you getting angry with me? I am not getting angry. But you don't discuss anything other than this. There's a limit. -Just relax, brother... -I am relaxed. -And you don't talk much! -Just relax. Do you know, Piku. For how long your uncle sits on the pot? What do you mean? Father had constipation, brother has and you also have the same. It's in the family. -No, brother. -Yes, father had... -No, I don't have constipation. -Binod, Binod. -You had constipation. -Why are you looking at me? -She is right. -I didn't... You are right. Uncle, you know about the water shortage in Delhi. Still he wants a bucket full of water because he's not satisfied with that jet spray. No, that's because that jet has a sharp flow of water. It hurts me here. And in winters he demands hot water. Now tell me who needs hot water to clean his back side? You must know that every third person in America has the same problem. In fact constipation is their biggest health issue. -Really? -Of course! Still they live care free. Looking at them can you ever tell what goes on inside them? Who cares? They're the biggest economy in the world. No, no. I care. Now for any normal person. Normal like, for example me. How can you call yourself normal so confidently? Hear me out. For any normal person a breakfast, a lunch and a dinner these three meals is all that is needed to smoothly do the job next morning. But they, on an average go once in three days! All through the day they just eat junk. Collecting inside as if a fixed deposit and then one day they go -and well... do it! -Gosh! No, no seriously don't laugh. And your condition isn't that bad. Do one thing, just chew your food like this... like a cow. Next day, you're bound to have a clear motion. Cow? Me? Mr. Banerjee, have you ever heard a cow or a buffalo ever getting constipated. Or doing a hard cow dung or loose. Think about it. Tell me. Right. His logic is right. Are you sure you are not a Bengali? Sir, not everything is a copyright by Bengalis. You didn't know this? No. There was a railing there? I think, yes. That was a new construction, needs repair... Will get it done. Your family is quite interesting. Just because everyone laughed, don't think everyone is impressed. We are very critical people. Oh, I know. Some people just can't like anyone. That's okay. You think I am like that? You are, but can't blame you for it. Actually, after a certain age, one becomes like that. Difficult to please. Then don't try to 'please'. Okay. Do you know, Piku... Binod was in secondary when our... secondary? Yes. Binod was in secondary when dad started building this house. And same year brother also got a job in ITC. 37, Virginia House, Chowringhee Lane. You remember? Earlier we just had ground floor. When they shifted here, that's when this 1st floor was made. Okay, listen... My head... Can we go out somewhere? Yeah... I'll just give dad his medicines. The center of my circumference. I feel is this place... This courtyard. Then after retirement why did you settle down in Delhi? You knew your brother doesn't earn as much as you did, -to maintain this house... -Can you keep quiet? -Why should I? -No, no... Carry on. She's right... A woman as educated as her should not be stopped from speaking her mind. But tell me Moni. In 1979, who wrote that job application for you in that BATA company? I had my connections there. Still you didn't take up that job. Why? Because then my salary would've been more than his. Hey. That's exactly what I call a low IQ thinking. You yourself are responsible for your frustrations. No one else. Yourself! Anyway, such old memories coming back. Remember, Binod, after mother passed away, her body was kept here. Head that side... legs here. And then Piku's mother's body that too.. Piku, let's go. -Where? -We'll just go out. Just... But where? Kolkata tour... Hey, Piku, don't be late. Yeah, I'll come soon. If you're so emotionally attached to this place, then why do you want to sell it off? You don't need money. What? Have you lost it? Brick by brick I've constructed this house. Champa Kunj can't be sold ever. It will never be sold! Our mother's name. Champa. That's written on it. Got it? But brother... No, no, no! If you can't maintain it, it's fine. I'll give the money. Take a right from here. Mom used to teach here. Then she met Dad and got married. And left the job? Yes. Why don't you elope and get married? He's not that bad. Moreover you need someone to run away with. That's true. Why didn't you marry? Next stop coffee shop and then by the Ganges. Okay. There used to be a theatre here. Now a building. That's what happens usually. Don't you want to sell off your house? One day a building will come up there too. I am just being practical. No, no, I am not saying you're wrong. Maybe this is the way forward. Guess this is what development is. But if you pull your roots,out what will remain? You know what I mean? Yes, dad. Crataegus. Carbo veg. 6-7 drops. Yes. Yes, I am coming. You guys must not be having any medical expenses. Looks like you manage your own treatment. Yeah. How old is you father? Must be at least 70? Exact. And the way you're being his doctor, he'll be around for another 20 more years which makes him 90. Touchwood. And in next 20 years, you too will become 50 approximately? -Hmm? -So? 50, in just taking care of your father? One minute. Why are you saying all this? You know my situation. You know he's dependent on me. Can't hear or see properly. Should I leave him? -No, no... -How will he manage on his own? I am not asking you to leave him. Even I haven't left my mother. I am just saying I hope you realize he is a selfish man. -No, he's not. -Yeah, he is. And even if he is, he's my father. If he's your father then why do behave like his mother? Because Rana, after a certain age parents can't live on their own. They need to be kept alive and that responsibility is of kids only. So if someone wants to marry me... He'll have to adopt your 90-year-old kid too? Of course. Will you marry me? I haven't gone mad. Then don't worry about me. No, no, I am not worrying. Dad used to take us there to show steamers. -There.. Can you see? There? -Grandpa... Please come down. Aunt Chhobi is here. Oh... Bhaku Da! Piku! Binod, how are you all? Wait, wait... I am coming down. -How come? Why... I mean? -See! -There. Surprised you! -Surprise... well... -Where's Piku? -Piku's gone out, you.. Yes, aunt. Your uncle suddenly made a plan for Darjeeling. What? So I thought I'll meet you all on the way. -What? -Where are you? Now come fast. Okay, okay. Thank you, dear. Cheers! Bhaku Da. Hey Bhaku Da. What is it? Why's your mood off? Now you're in Kolkata. What's wrong? -No, I am thinking... -I was only seven. About Piku? No point. That Sourob is already married now. You didn't like him. So what's the need of this 'thinking' now? I am thinking when will you spare me. -I'm asking you about him. -As in. I can't believe, you've come here, too. Okay, so if you've such issues with me, I'll go. Last night, I saw you seeing Piku. -Can I go, dad? -No... I was looking at you. -Oh really -Yes. Oh really, say the truth or else you'll be in trouble. You want enema? Look I am not meditating here. I am ready for fourth marriage also. If you've done little then do the rest later. Let's end this here for today. So Mr. Choudhary, ready to go back to Delhi? -Oh done with badminton? -Yeah. Why? So who all are there in your family? My sister, mother and father passed away. Father died? Death. Who said death? Whose death? Rana's father... He died. -Not now, long ago. -What was the problem? No problem as such. Died without any problem? I mean he had cancer. So cancer is a problem. Why are you saying he had no problem? Well, he had cancer but it was removed. Oh okay. Where was it? Throat. Throat! Smoking, is it? Where are you going? So they must've done tracheotomy for him to breathe. Did they reconstruct Food pipe also? -Yeah, something like that... -Food pipe? What do you mean something like that? -I mean... -You should know what all the doctor did. Dad, everyone is not so interested in all this. This medical nonsense has become your hobby. Hey, I am not talking to you. I am also not talking to you! Then hey, listen... Where are you going? Then what happened? Nothing. He was in the ICU and then on a ventilator. Ventilator! You should've not put him on a ventilator. It is wrong. Piku, what he did to his father, you don't do that with me. I'm telling you. You see, all this is commercial business. Professional money-making. Why did you allow them to do it? Allow, I mean... I was... No, no but why? Why did you allow them to do this to your father? Sir... Look, my father was on death bed. Doctor said we needed to put him on the ventilator. So what could've I done? I couldn't have said no. It's not my decision. Of course, it is! Do you've any idea how much pain your father went through? His whole body must've been pricked with needles. Drip, blood, catheter down below. ECG machine. It's inhuman treatment.. You tortured your father! You get up if the nurse picks you up. Be at her mercy to change your clothes. If you've passed motion in those clothes or just keep lying down. Oh gosh, no! Look, Piku, when I die. Don't do all this with me. I want to die in peace! Do you always have to overdo it? But I was only telling you what not to do with me. Why did he go? Did I say anything to him? No! Brother Rana... Grandpa has sent this for you and has called you down. You don't need to be sorry. I am alright. I didn't feel bad. It's okay. I am fine. Sorry? for? Check that our water pump is not working. You did civil right? You did civil engineering. Check it. What? There. Water. Water pump. It's not working. Call an electrician. It's not my job. What do you mean it's not your job? You must be knowing? Okay, fine, I know, but I am getting late. So you call anyone else. You're going now? Who's going? No, no, how can you go? There's no water in the over head tank or in the bathroom -or the flush, how can he go? -I don't care... Water or no water in flush or tank or wherever else. -It's a plumber's job, not mine. -What? How will I cook? There's no water in the kitchen. As if you were making mutton kebabs? Fish rice, but that too I can't cook now. Not that. -We'll have to order. -No, no... Khichdi. Dr. Srivastava told me to eat only pulses and rice. -But brother how will she cook rice. -Hear me out. -That needs water too. -You talk to him. Binod, it's a useless argument. Oh she just needs an excuse.. What a useless argument! - ...to avoid cooking. Shut up! Where's the water pump? It's on. Check the water flow. Not coming. Are you angry? Not your fault. Now? Not yet. Am I irritating you? I have a good tolerance. That means I am talking to you forcibly. Yes.. Just like dad... Ditto... Same! Don't compare me with that man! Water is coming... A little. With your attitude, you won't find any companion your entire life. It's not like that if I seek actively somebody or the other I'll definitely find. Worry about yourself. You shouldn't be left with Budhan for company in old age. I'm serious. Just be aware. It's better that you leave. And there's water now.. -Fine, now I am also leaving. -Okay. -There's water. -Got it. See I told you he'll repair it. This water pump company has shut down, change the pump please. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Choudhary thank you so much. Thank you. Now you can leave, better to take breaks. Yeah, I'll see where I get by the evening. You could've stayed for a day or two more. Why? Not needed, he has his business there. His family. No, no you must go. You go, you go. And once you get there, inform me. Okay? Do you know what the real issue is, Mr. Banerjee? What? No one understands you. Yes. You're right. Can I suggest something? Yes, tell me. -Will you listen? -Yes, yes tell me. Stop hiding salt. Hey, mister, hey... Wait, wait. In straight and simple words stop being so difficult. Alright? Do you meditate? Piku, all well? Greetings! Is your father in? With this kind of a family at least someone should stay calm, balanced. You must begin, you'll stay relaxed. I am relaxed. Is it? I'll call you. By the way my, family is totally.. You thought you'll play this game and we'll sell off the house? No, no, sir, that builder said.. -Otherwise later... -Later means when? Later even if all these people have died I'll be still alive to take care about this house okay. Why will you take care of our house? Later when... Aunt. Champa Kunj will not be sold. And if uncle has no objection then let's find a tenant, okay? Thank you. Now you leave, okay? What nonsense! Waste of time! Why did they call if they didn't want to listen to me? -Okay, Piku. Take care. -Bye, bye.. Of course, I'll be there. Hey wait... Is this your bicycle? -It's mine. -Yours? Yeah, Syed? No, I don't know when I'll be back. How did he even go? And why did you not wake me up? But you know him, Piku. Why didn't you lock the bicycle? He'd taken the keys last night. I've searched for him everywhere but I couldn't find him. Go and check once again. Sudha, go and look for him. Whole life he kept mom also stuck in all this! She sacrificed her own happiness to tolerate all his tantrums. He said I want to go to Kolkata so I said fine, I left everything and came with him. See what he is doing now? What if he falls down on the road? Ma'am, he's here. I saw everything. Writers' Building. Dalhousie. Shyambazar. And these dumplings. Well... Who'll eat all this? All my life I have eaten pumpkin, bitter gourd because of him. And now he wants to eat this. Sweets and what not. Get medicine from inside. I know what drama is going to happen now. I am fine. No drama will happen. You are not fine, dad. And I will cycle tomorrow also. No, you will not! Do you get that? One month ago he had collapsed. His BP had dropped. Calm down. Suddenly one fine day you can't cycle for 25 kilometres. You think your lungs are fit to do all this! Nonsense. Your Heart cannot take it. You are 70 years old! Just doesn't listen! I said we'll take a flight but no he wanted to go by road only! Have you ever thought what I want? Absolutely selfish! Nonsense! Yes, I've had physical relationships, but is this something he needs to tell every man I meet? That meet my daughter she is not a virgin. Which father does this? Calm down, Piku. Have some water. Have it. Have it. What? Ah... Rana was right. One should eat everything. Done? Like never before. Piku! Extraordinary! The best motion! Good. So no cycling from tomorrow. I understand you all are angry. But everyone's way to go has been decided. Even mine. I know. Even mine, it will be through my digestive track. My life will go from here. So let me cycle. I am enjoying. -Hey, Binod... -Yes, sir. Tomorrow... Let's go out... Piku.. Piku.. -Yes, uncle? -Piku. See what's happened to brother. Didn't wake up with an alarm also. I also woke him, but he says nothing. Moni. Moni, come fast... Grandpa... Grand pa... I switched on the light in the morning. He didn't get up. -Get up, grandpa... -Moni... What happened? Bhaskor... Call Dr. Ghosh. Call the doctor. Grandpa... Grandpa... Piku... Piku... May his soul rest in peace. May his soul rest in peace. Oh, that means either cardiac Arrhythmia. Basically irregular heartbeat. Or sleep apnea. Your dad always wished for a peaceful death. Yes, uncle, no tube, no ventilator. Dad was happy, he said it was the best motion. He always forced me to listen to him, but... He made sure death also listened to him. Let me tell you all. Dad was in peace. He was in no pain. And those who know dad, they know, he had just one problem, constipation. But that too got cured before he left. So dad's death was a happy one and I'm going to miss him. Now no one will call me from this room, 'Piku... Piku...' Bhaskor Da was a big attention seeker. If that man sees Piku is here all sad roaming with her hair open. He'll come immediately and take her away too. Piku, I love Bhaskor Da. He must be roaming somewhere around. -He must be listening in on us. -Piku... -Come here for a minute. -He won't like it without us. Or maybe he has already made a plan of coming back as Piku's kid. Don't mind me saying, but I need to tell you something. But I will pray to God if he comes again, then he should come without constipation. You and Syed are close, it's okay. But your dad had just one issue with this. Look it's my duty to tell you. He felt... in fact he was sure, that Syed too has constipation. Syed. You want a drink? Do you have constipation? Huh? Do you have constipation? -Yeah... -Why didn't you tell me before? I mean... it's not chronic. Just... Piku. Piku... Here is the balance amount and this is for petrol. And what about that outing on Ganga Ghat? And that mental torture I went through because of your dad? My god, he kept everyone on their toes. You can't judge parents, no. No matter how they are. After taking care of that kind of a man even you come in the category of Rani Laxmi Bai, Annie Besant kinds, you know, the great women. Anybody in my place would've done that. No one does it these days. So now? Will you manage it alone? I think so. I mean, that much dad has prepared me. It's a small spelling. Bhaskor. Bhaskor. K-O-R, not K-A-R. If it's not done by tomorrow, I am not going to pay. K-O-R! Ma'am. I... OK come from tomorrow. Okay.
