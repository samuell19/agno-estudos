As Simple As That. Miss! Miss! Hi there. Hello. I'm sorry to bother you but are these yours? Could you please move them a bit? We didn't have a good reception because of your sheet. -Do you live on the second floor? -No, I live on the third. You're right. It's nice to meet you. Welcome. Thank you. Sorry for leaving our things in the corridor. Were they yours? Yes, I'll ask Abbas to come and get them. Poor thing he installed this single handedly. He said the place is good. He didn't know it's behind your clothes-line I'm sorry anyway. No worries. Watch the stairs, slowly! Hold on! Let's take the lift. You shouldn't walk down the stairs. No, I'm better with the stairway. Are you afraid? No. We're here. Give me your hand. -Sorry for the trouble. -Not at all. If you need anything, just let me know. Okay, later I could get a kettle of boiling water from you. -Sure! See you. -See you. Damn it! She's never home! How are you Tahereh? Tahereh, I dreamt of you last night. You were worried. You could come and stay with me if you like. Your dad is worried about you too. How are the kids? How is the engineer? Ghasem has a passenger today to Teheran. He'll be back in the evening. Give him a call and come back with him. Tell him I called to see how he's doing. I believe the secret of life is flexibility. Her husband name is Majid Zaheri. It's interesting that some girls and boys... aren't familiar with their own mental... and personal situation before marriage. They don't know what they like and favor. People have been talking about subconscious for many years and this shows that these people... don't know themselves enough. They enter a life they can't bear. In today's language we call this bewilderedness. We miscalculate our situation. We think that we can move forward with some sorts of excitement. But then we give up. When something is said, these excitements might change. -Hello? Hi. -Hello sister. How can I help you? Can I please talk to Mr. Hajji? Hold on, please. They title these excitements love. A person who doesn't know himself, can't acknowledge the person facing him. What sort of life do you like? A simple and nice one? What kind of person are you? For instance, how would you react if you get angry? Actually, this is one of the questions of my point. Just like that. As simple as that. Hello? Mr. Hajji is not in right now. How can I help you? Kindness is very good I'd like to consult the book. Please call from 10 to 12. But it's urgent. As I said you can call between 10 and 12. Goodbye. Kindness is the most important factor in our ethic. -Hello Behjat. I'm sorry. -Hello dear Tahereh I am so sorry. If there weren't some neighbors like you what would I do? -I arranged these for you. -Thank you, thank you so much. -Tahereh? -Yes? Give me two sets of rice dishes as well, please. Okay, wait a minute. Tahereh! Give me a few sets of glasses as well. Glasses? I have quite a few. I'll put them aside for you. Don't make so much noise. Go and get the fruits. Hurry up! Do you see Tahereh? We're so unlucky. They're moving just when we are holding the wedding. They'll gather everything by tonight I saw the girl this morning. She seems really nice. Don't worry. God knows! I have a lot to do. Tahereh, please come upstairs, I need you to do something. Thank you. Please hold this. Hello Mrs. Tahereh. Hello Tahereh. Welcome! Hello Minoo. Congratulations! Thank you. Thank you dear Tahereh. Are you going to spread the cloth here? They're Minoo's friends. They're taking care of the wedding cloth. They said it would be better to put it in the hall. Because of photography and things. Shall I put the mirror here? Mrs. Behjat, where should we put the mirror? I don't know. Place the Koran and lectern in the middle, and put the mirror and the candlesticks next to them. Put the mirror on the side and the Koran and the lectern in the middle. -Hello. -Hello. Wouldn't it be better to spread the cloth in one of the rooms? The ladies would feel more comfortable and it won't be in the way either. I kept saying to ask Tahereh since morning. Please, take it to the small room. Mrs. Mohammadpour? I'm Dezfouli I wanted to ask you to come today. It's the last session. We're choosing the best works of the students to be published. Don't be lazy! Come around, so there won't be any complaints later on. Don't be late like last week. I'm waiting for you. See you soon. It snowed. Chandelier. White clothes. White clothes. Yes? Hello Mrs. Engineer. Hello Asghar -I've come to take the plans. -Which plans? -Didn't the engineer call you? -No. -Excuse me Mrs -But Amir didn't call me. He said the plans are in the holder. Come up. I'm coming. -Hello? -Where are you Tahereh? I was about to call you. Hold on a second. Hello Asghar, come in. Hello. How are you? The engineer said those plans... Which plans? I have no idea where you put them. Hold on a second. Listen, do something I said hold on a second. Let me check the cupboard. There are only plans over here. I said there are only plans over here. Give the Ozalids plans in the cupboard to Asghar. All of them? I'll call you later. Bye for now. Hello? Amir? Here you are Asghar. Please, put them on the shoe shelf and I'll take them. -Hello Tahereh. -Hello. Hello Masoud. Thank you. You're welcome. Hello? Anybody home? -Who is it? -It's Tahereh, your neighbor. I'm sorry. I'm there in a minute. That's all right. I've bought tea for you. I'll put it down here. -Are you home for another hour? -Yes. Today the neighbors are very busy. If it's all right with you I would leave our house key here. So that my daughter doesn't isn't locked outside. Oh! You have a daughter? How old is she? She's 8. Her name is Arezou. What was that? I knocked on the wood. You're too young to have a daughter this age. Thank you. Were you also like this, five months pregnant? Hopefully in a month you'll feel better. I have to go now. Bye. What's all that noise in the parking area? The family on the fourth floor is having a wedding. Really? How are they? Are they friendly? I have to go now. Bye. Hello. Hello. How are you? Please, come in. Welcome. -Are you Behjat's guest? -Yes, with your permission. Please, come in. -Excuse me. -No problem. -Thank you so much. -You're welcome. -Hello Tahereh. -Hello. Congratulations. Hold it up! She wants to pass. Hello. Why don't you come in? Hello Mrs. Dezfouli. I wanted to say that I can't make it today. Let me see it I haven't finished it yet. I need a few more days. Are you all right? Yes, everything's fine. When you called I thought I should come. It's nothing. I just feel a bit down. -Hello. -Hello, dear. The house is very bright, and the unimpressive chandelier is awaiting the night. Hello Mrs. Dezfouli. -Hello. It might be seen tonight. Well it's a nice beginning. But it's unfinished. It's nice. Just like you. The day we met, it snowed so much... that my clothes became white. Even snowed in the dark rooms of my heart. It's magnificent. Why didn't you carry on? If possible, please add my name to the list of the works to be published. Your name? Or your poem? Look! What the birds have done! It's okay, not the first time. No! Leave it! Look. They love this place so much. They don't even leave for winter. This is chocolate cake and that's a cheese one. Excuse me, what's this? Is it walnut? -As I told you we don't have any! -Pardon me. Okay. Please give me a cream cake with Nescafe topping. Pay this to the cashier. Shall I write anything on it? On it? No, thank you. Excuse me. Arezou? Ali? -Hello Tahereh. -Hello. Just in time. We're serving lunch. Thank you. Have you seen my daughter? She's somewhere here. She's so cute. Arezou! Your mom is here. Arezou! Hello. -Hello mom. -When did you come? -About half an hour ago. -Why you haven't changed your clothes? -I didn't have the keys. -But I gave the house keys to this lady. -Roxanna. -Anyway, go and get the keys. Where is Ali? Ali and Mohammad are on the rooftop. -Get the keys, we have to go. -I'll stay here. Tahereh, why are you standing at the door? Come and have lunch with us. Thank you. I'm tired and I have things to do. Just wait. How about this? -It's nice. -Is it eye-catching? Yes, it's nice. He brought them from the port. Each time he goes there, he brings one of these I wish he would bring some large eye-catching ones. Hold on! I'm coming! Tahereh, come soon! Now we are to have a look at a desert house in the city, Naeen. We'll visit pirnia house. You mentioned a good point. The desert overflows with calmness. Especially at nighttime. The biggest advantage is that you always feel calm. It feels like the end of the world, where nothing would ever happen. When you're in the desert, the only thing surrounding you is the sky. -Hello Mrs. Tahereh. -Hello. Leave the door open, Ali is coming. Ali! Ali! Arezou? What if mom comes in? Yes? -When do you want to eat? -Not now. We're busy. When do they want to leave? Be quiet! They might hear you. We're trying the dresses on. -But your food will get cold. -We're busy now. Okay! I'll see you later. I'll take care of them, don't worry. -Hello. -Hello. These are Mohammad's chicks I know they are, but why on earth have you brought them here? They're having a wedding. He asked me to have them until the guests are gone. What were you thinking? Is our house a place for these? They don't have wings, they can't fly. They'll make the house smell. No, they won't. Mohammad gave all of them a bath. Come and eat. I've warmed up your meal. Hey! I'm talking to you. What do we have for lunch? Barberry rice with chicken. I put in the chicken breast for you I don't like barberries. I'll separate them for you I don't want to eat! Can you just leave me alone? Playing with my sorrowful and broken heart has become your hobby. Can't you remember all the promises we made? You've been mean to me, but I'm still keeping my promises. Don't break my heart or my sigh will ruin your life. Don't tell me you're not aware that my heart is full of curses. Don't tell me that you don't know my loving heart cries for you. Day and night when you're not around. Do we have something to feed them? Feed who? The chicks I mean. We have pastry! That is for the neighbors. Don't touch it. Then what should I feed my chicks with? Give them some of these. Why is the neighbor's cake in our fridge? I'll give them the cake the right time. No, not that! It's chicken! But it's not for you, it's for the chicks! They are small chicks, but they are chicken. They can't eat chicken. Okay, let's give them some vegetables then. Do they eat vegetables as well? Yes, they do. -Is that all? -That's more than enough for them. When do you want to eat? I told you I don't want that! There are barberries all over it. Stop complaining about God's blessings! It's a sin. No way! You're the sinner because you put barberries with God's blessings. Ali, I've brought cutlet for you. It's tomato and pickles separately. I hope there's no onion in it! No, and it would be a good idea if you would give some rest for your eyes. Mom, I'm going to my English class today. Can't you stay here? I have nothing to do there I'll wait in the library until your class is over. Why don't you ever wear your red scarf? It's not good for this season. From now on I'll go to class on my own. How? By a cab. Okay. On my own. Sure. -All alone. -Of course, you've grown up now. What about today? Are you coming in? No I feel like walking. I'll pick you up when your class is over. Okay, I'm leaving. You go now. Please, use a different color for each. Pardon? I mean I would like the keys to have different colors. Sure. Why do you keep changing jobs all the time? You don't know who you are? The shoe store didn't make any profit. All the stores around here sell clothes, so I thought it would be better to open a boutique. What does this remind you of? -You still have it. -Yes. I gave you such good shoes. They still look brand new. Don't get too excited. It has nothing to do with the shoes. It's because I don't have anywhere to go. And when you don't go anywhere. Your shoes stay new I feel sorry for you you're so lonely. Anything new with your neighbors? It's Minoo's wedding tomorrow. Are you kidding? Behjat's daughter? But she's too young to marry. Poor thing. Everyone's talking about you. Why don't you come by one of these days? Don't even think about that! I'm so glad that I don't see them. If I went there they would ask all those questions about my divorce. What was your fault? His fault? Your aunt's fault? No way! Damn all of them. Are you still going to the painting classes? No. I quit. -Did you quit exercising as well? -Yes. -I go to poetry classes. -Poetry?! That's great. Have you heard from you child? She's fine. I see her once a week. Girls get along better with their dads. Isn't it difficult for you? No. Bahram's mother takes care of her way better then I did. Hello, Hello. How can I help you? Excuse me, how much is that dress? You mean the green overall? Yes. What was the price on the green overall? I have no idea. Sorry sir, but we both work here. Our boss isn't in. He'll be here on Saturday. Please come back on Saturday. Goodbye. He wanted to buy a gift for his wife. I bet he'd done something wrong and trying to make up for it. -Want some? -No, I'm fine. How are Amir and the children? Thank God. Is anything wrong? Are you all right? Yes, sure. Hello. Hello, welcome. I hope everything's fine. Hello. Excuse me, my father wants to know if we can shop with these or not. Yes, my dear. You can use this coupons. -Thank you. -You're welcome. If you want a formal suit, they are in this section. Those are the casuals. Okay. What size do you have in mind? 48? If you don't mind me asking? I don't know. You don't know me? You're so bold! Yes, it's me! What's wrong? Why are you so angry? No. Yes. Sir! Your receipt. What happened? It swallowed my card. These cards have pin numbers. If you don't know them, it will get swallowed. God knows that I panicked. Yes. No, someone is standing here I'll call you back in ten minutes. Bye. Hello? Yes, please. -Hello Mrs. Bordbari. -I'm Mohammadpour. I mean Kazemi. Is it you, Tahereh? How are you? Are you calling from outside? I dialed Amir's cell number. Has he diverted it to the company? No, his cell phone is with me for now. He's busy with meetings. I thought it's lunchtime, so I could talk to him? Everyone's in the meeting. They're having lunch in a restaurant with the delegation I hope it goes well. They are so late I see. When do you think I can talk to him? I don't know. I can give him the cell, if it's urgent. No, there's no need for that. Poor Arezou also called but she couldn't talk to him either. Arezou?! What did she want? How many times do I have to repeat myself? I'm dealing with a bunch of idiots here! Tell Arezou, I checked the weather forecast for her on the internet. The weather will be fine, but it'll get a bit cold by the end of the week. It won't snow, so she can go to the camp. but you better pack a raincoat too. Arezou doesn't like raincoats, Mrs. Bordbari. Goodbye. Which shirt would you like? The pink one, please. Congratulations. If you want I can send the suit for you. No, it's okay for the moment. No problem. Thank you for shopping here. Thank you. Hello Ali. Anything happened? Wait, Ali! Has anything happened? No. Mom, will you get a cab to take us home? Say, anything happened? Don't! It's embarrassing. Mom? What's your job? Aren't you a house worker? I don't know in English. Nima and the others say that house worker is a cook. Is that right? No, it's not. Hello? Excuse me sir, I want to consult the book. You need to call between 10 and 12 a.m. for that, sister I know but I didn't have an access to a phone at that time. Call at the evening then. It might be possible to do that before the prayers. If you recall, I called in the morning as well. Goodbye. -Mom! Help! It's there! -Mom! So you're scared! No, I'm not scared. It's dirty! Over there Mom! Over there! The bathroom cockroaches are clean, the toilet ones are dirty. Over there, Mom! Kill it! Get it! It's there! Well done, Mom! You killed it! Arezou, let's play with the chicks. No, I don't feel like. -Come on! -I said I don't want to! -Arezou! -Yes. Bring me a pack of sour grapes from the freezer. Mom, you've stuffed the freezer so much! It's on the bottom row, on your right. Okay, I found it. All the bags are stuck together. Pull it stronger. They're frozen. It won't come out. I can't! They all fell out! Don't worry, pick all of them up. Put the meat on one side, and the vegetables on the other. Then put the cutlets and the eggplants on the top, so they don't get squashed. Eggplants should get golden. If they're black they taste bitter. Mom, what are you wearing for the wedding, tomorrow? Be careful not to burn them. The oil is jumping out! When I grow up I'll only eat in restaurants. She's right. The food in restaurants is much better. Close the fridge I'm hungry. Leave that cake! I can fry eggs if you want. I don't feel like eggs now. Leave that! Go! You know what? When I grow up I'll buy a fridge and put it in my room. Hello? What happened to my orders? I'm going to the toilet. Nobody follow me! I've fixed the doorknob. You can close the door. Why they don't pick up the phone? Hello? They are like this! When you order only a few things they won't deliver it. Be careful, it's burning! Excuse me sir, when will my order get delivered? Hello. I was just about to send your order. Goodbye. I'm sorry, we're very busy. Your order is ready I was in a rush. Please add these to the list with some pesticide as well. -What kind of pesticide? -For cockroaches. And wrapping paper as well. Hello. Here you are. I still don't know which of these macaroni is good. Both. We don't sell low quality stuff here. Some of them gets really sticky. Excuse me. Hello Sir. It doesn't have any instructions on it. If you add some turmeric and oil to the boiling water... They don't stick together. You mean I have to pour the boiling water first? And pour some cold water on it when you're draining it. Let me write this down. This tea isn't good. The red Iranian teas are much better. They take longer to brew but the color and the aroma is much better. -Thank you, Mrs. Hajji. -You're welcome. Please, how much? -Be my guest. -Thank you 10,000 tomans of this for Kazem. He came and fixed my doorknob. He'll know when you tell him. Okay, I'll give it to him, be my guest, you'll be around. No, I want to pay. I might not be around for a while. Once again, apologies about today. No problem. Tahereh! It's so good you came. What are you doing out here in the cold? I felt lonely and I thought I better come down. But there was no one to go up with. Here, I brought this for you. Tahereh, are you coming with me to the fourth floor? Okay. I want to go and help Behjat. Poor thing, she's all alone. I must help her. You fit in quickly. Your eyebrows need trimming, get on them. Thank you, bye! See you later I'll send you my hair-curler. Boil it in water before you use them. Bye. Arezou! Arezou! Damn it! What's wrong mom? Where the hell have you been? The eggplants are burnt. Where were you? Where is Ali? I'm talking to you! On the rooftop. Okay guys, you go. I'll join you later. What the hell is he doing on the rooftop?! He's playing Spiderman with Mohammad's chicks. You're so clumsy! Ali! I only went up for two minutes, to tell them to come down... To make handicrafts for the wedding cloth. I told you to watch these! You're so clumsy! You'll never get anywhere! Don't slam the door! I'm talking to you! -I wish we'd brought some water as well. -It's really good. Hello Mrs. Tahereh. Hello mom I swear we asked all neighbors, and they said the cake wasn't theirs. Didn't we? I swear we asked all of them. Don't you want some, mom? I've brought some cake and milk for you. Until dinner is ready. What a nice perfume. According to the forecast, there won't be any rain until the end of next week. But it might get a bit cold. Do you want to take my red raincoat? Can I wear it at the camp? Of course. It doesn't fit me anymore. You can wear a jacket under it I could even tie it. Yes. I've got these keys for you. So you can come in when I'm not home. They look pretty. Turn it off! -What are you doing under the bed? -Something. I've brought cake and milk for you. I don't like cakes! Come over here, mom! Where? Come here for a second. What are you doing under the bed? Hush! They will hear us. Hold this. What do you want to do? Take this! Shoot the one I flash the light on, okay? Okay? Okay. You don't hold a gun like that! Let me show you. Ali, I know how to do. Then wear the glasses so you can see better I don't want to. Which one shall I shoot? Over there! The soldier in the middle. Start counting. Ready? 3, 2, 1, fire! Well done, mom! Nice shot. Yes, a piece of cake for me. I've used real guns too. Really? Yes, when I was a child we used to go out in summer. We went to the country. My uncle was a hunter. Sometimes he let us take a shot. With a real rifle? Yes! And he only let me ride his horse. The rest of the kids could only ride the donkeys and the mules. Then what did dad ride? Your dad? He wasn't around. It's the pressure-cooker. Mom! The game only started. Mom, give me the salt. Don't take too much. It's bad for your eyes. Can I go upstairs after dinner? I want to see the wedding cloth. No way! It's late and you have school tomorrow! Right, mom? It's none of your business! Mom, he interferes all the time! We'll talk about it later. What did you say? Nothing. Have your salad. Mom, what's "mouth" in English? I think they call it "mouse". Mouse? Then what is "mouse" called? See what he talks about at dinner? Leave him alone. He's only a child. Not at all, I'm not a child! Ali! I told you not to fight each other at the table! I'll say whatever I like! Mouse! Mouse! Mouse! Ali, come back and finish your dinner! I'm full! -Who do you want to call? -Daddy's company. A cockroach! A black one! A spider! Instead of going up, let's pack your bag for the camp. We can do it later. Ms. Bordbari, can I talk to my dad? I want to ask what "mouse" is in English. Really? So what is "mouth" called? What did you say? "Mouth", like the sound? Thank you so much. Bye. Mom. Yes, darling? Is Arezou back? Sleep my dear. Mom. Yes dear? One of the chicks is missing. We'll find it. Sleep now. When did you come? What are you wearing? Do you like it? Roxanna made it for me. Yes, it's really nice. Mom, you sing really nice. You have a great voice. Go to sleep my dear. You have school tomorrow. You need to get up. Can I ask a favor? Can I sleep in your bed until dad comes? Okay, go and sleep in my bed. It's cold! Sleep. Your dad may arrive any minute. Why are you smiling? Nothing. Come on, tell me. Just reminded me of my childhood. Our house was huge... Lots of rooms opening into each other. When we had guests, poor uncle Ghasem... He had to place all the mattresses in the rooms for the guests. Then your aunt and I used to go and sleep on all of them. They were so cold. It was so good. Then your grandmother would show up... To say "Oot Parchasy". What does it mean? It means close your eyes and go to bed, naughty child. Armed men attacked American soldiers and killed four. Heights are occupied by Israel. Confirming the attack, the American army announced that three American soldiers were... wounded as well. Witnesses in the Jacobean city of Iraq claimed that an Apache chopper crashed... in the city. We have no knowledge about the circumstances. Iraq's public crime court denied the appeal of the former dictator, and approved the sentence. The Zionist regime announced... that if Syria agrees to lease the Jolan Hills for 99 years. It will make peace with Syria. Lindman, the Israeli minister of the Road and Constructions... stated that peace with Syria is possible. only if Syrians agree the 99-year lease of Jolan Hills. At the moment the Syrian Jolan... Hello Tahereh, it's Ghasem. Hello Ghasem, where are you? Mom told me to call you. When do you want to come? Come here. Have a dinner with us. I just arrived. I have to leave soon. If I come, I would be late. Amir hasn't come home yet. He's not answering his cell phone either. I'll be in Tehran in two hours, call me if you want me to pick you up I'll be waiting for your call. -Bye. -Bye. I'm coming Roxanna. Hello, how are you? I'm sorry. I come to get the hair-curlers. Yes, you must be Roxanna's husband. Yes. Sorry for making a mess here. I promise I'll sort it out today. Sorry, would you get them for me? Here you are. Thank you. Sorry for bothering you. Give my regards to Roxanna. Roxanna, dear. Open the door. I've brought the hair-curlers for you I won't open the door. Has dad come home? He's on his way. Sleep now. Hi, I'm home. -Hello, how are you? -Hi, how are you? Not bad. What a mess I've made. Congratulations. They did it finally. The guys make fun of me when I say this is the second suit I've ever own. What's the smell? Anything burned? Ali has gone through my stuff again. He has his own playstation, don't let him touch my computer. He made a mess. It's cheap, isn't it? No. How are you my beautiful? Dinner is ready. Haven't you had dinner? Have you? No. Is it Asghar's taste? Asghar? No way! He's not into these things. He doesn't even know what a suit is. Did you see Saddam's execution on TV? Are you home dad? What is my sweet girl doing awake at this time? It's not morning yet. Dad, give the camp money to mom. -And sign the agreement too. -Okay. Do you want me to come? My daughter is going camping. I'm going to miss her. Why are you not having anything with your rice? Don't put so much. I have no clue about restaurant food. I asked what Mortazavi ordered. They asked for a steamy dish. I said well, all dishes are steamy. The food came out, two waiters carrying each portion. It wasn't steamy, it was the steam cooker itself. Leave it. Mortazavi is still working. He won't leave me alone. Even now. Amir, I want to tell you something, I want to... We agreed on partnership. I don't know what they're doing in the company. What if he registers the plan under his own number? You don't have to eat if you're not hungry. Yes, it's better if I eat light tonight. But it was great! The fish, spicy and really tasty. I'm having fish! Quiet! You'll wake the children. The fish has thorns. Don't forget Arezou's camp money. -Didn't I give it to you? -No. I couldn't withdraw money today. It's good you mentioned I've changed the number of our joint account I'll write a check for Arezou's money. How much is it? 40,000 tomans. What's the date today? 31st of December. What are they doing? They want to kill us with this noise? I won't be able to sleep. Don't call them. Hello Behjat? Excuse me, I wanted to talk to Behjat. Behjat? It's for you. It's only one night. They'll have a wedding. Try your suit and let me know if it fits. All right but don't you dare make fun of me. Hello. Who is it? I would like to talk to Mrs. Behjat. Mrs. Behjat is busy I'm her neighbor. Is it urgent? Yes. Hold on a second, please. I don't know what he has on his mind. Hold this. Give me my shirt. I'm doing all the work in the company. Of course this was our deal. It's fine but he should know what he's doing. He should understand, it's not a game. I swear if I go to the office tomorrow, and I don't see my name under the plan... He'll see how things are, when I don't show up for a couple of days. He won't take me for granted. He'll beg me to come. Mark my words. Why don't you talk to him? What shall I tell him? Sometimes there is no point to talk about things. Don't you agree? Yes. It doesn't suit me at all. It's too formal. I look like the government people I think it's the color of the shirt. When was this picture taken? Where are we? -Our first trip together. -Look. We had only 5,000 tomans. We paid 250 for this and the rest for the hotel. How young we were. The rooms facing the shrine were too expensive. I said let's get the other one. Then you said it was okay because we only have one honeymoon. The hotel has been destroyed since. Look at my hair, it's good I get reminded. We didn't have any money for dinner. Then someone knocked on the door and we got some vowed food. You said it was a miracle. Really? Yes. Do you remember what the food was? The food? No. It was mince with french fries. Still remember? Tahereh. If we manage to sign this contract. We might be able to move to a bigger house.

Hello Behjat, is everything alright? I'm really worried. I was afraid that you might be asleep. You just got home? What can I do for you? I can't sleep. Could you come up for a minute? I'm not feeling good tonight. Maybe tomorrow. Tomorrow's too late. Just come up for a minute. I don't know what to do. Come on in, dear. Look at him. He doesn't care at all. I swear he just came home. If you take the mustache, they are like kids. Let's go, dear. Come on in, Minoo and Manijeh are asleep. I've been standing on the wedding cloth for two hours I keep talking to myself I keep thinking... The guy is nice but they want to take her to another city. Look at her innocent face. She's my child, I can't help it. You're a mother, you can understand. Tahereh, please sit here for a minute. May peace be upon Mohammad and his followers. -Hold this. -What shall I do? Open it. Me? Why me? I've been thinking since morning, and only you came to my mind. I want a happily married woman to open my daughter's Koran. May God give her a happy marriage. I can't do this Behjat. Please, don't break my heart. Please open it for the sake of the Holy Koran you're holding. Is it bad? No. What does it say? Nice things. Really good. Thank God. Tahereh? Yes? Where are you? I'm right here
