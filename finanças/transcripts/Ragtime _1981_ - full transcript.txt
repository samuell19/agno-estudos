[ Men Agreeing ] I've used this road several times, and I've never had to pay a toll. Well, somebody must've been sleeping on duty. [ Men Chuckling ] All right. How much is the toll?

[ Horse Whinnying ] [ Chuckles ] Brand-new car like that. I want it cleaned up. Go ahead. Clean it up. Can it, Willie. Nobody's laughing. Now, what the hell do you boys think you're up to? I'll tell you exactly what happened, Frankie. This here fancy nigger parked in front of the firehouse. Now, if you don't think that's a serious business, tell me about it when your house is burning, we can't get the pump out, and the road's all blocked because of a nigger's car. I had no intention of stopping in front of the firehouse, but my way was blocked. I don't know why you did this. I never caused you any harm. You blocked access to an emergency service, and I got witnesses here to prove it! You're lying. Willie, no! Don't you say that to me! - Nigger! - Come on, come on, come on. Over here. Right there. [ Horse Whinnying ] [ Sighs ] Look. [ Sighs ] There ain't no real damage done. Just... scoop the shit off, take your automobile, and get along outta here. What do you say? I'm not goin' nowhere until my car is cleaned. I don't want no trouble. Just do as I say. You know I'm telling the truth. Just get in your car-- Why are you letting these men intimidate you? Nobody's intimidating me! You just don't know what you're getting into, and I'm trying to keep your nose clean. Would you be a good boy and just get along! I want my car cleaned. Clean it then, damn you! Clean it and go! I want the man who did it to clean it! [ Frankie ] All right. All right. Let me put it this way. I can arrest you for blocking a public service exit, for creating a public nuisance... and about ten other things that I ain't gonna bother to mention. Now, am I making myself clear? Yes. Good. Officer, I still want my car cleaned. Oh, for Christ's sakes. Ain't you got any sense in your head? I'm trying to help you. You leave me no choice. I'm sorry. You're under arrest. [ Ringing ] It's all right. Yes, sir. Yes? Yes. I see. I'll be right down. Better be getting yourself some new help. Once a nigger goes wrong, there's no putting him right. [ Typewriter Keys Clacking ] Thank you, sir. Whoa! Whoa! Well, what happened? You said there wasn't any physical damage done. There wasn't when I was arrested. [ Sighs ] This is what I was saying. You should have just cleaned it up to begin with. Now look what's happened. Well, the damage isn't that bad. It shouldn't take much to put it right. Please, if you would be kind enough to tell Sarah what happened, but tell her not to worry. And tell her that I'll be talking with her soon. Hey, wait a minute! Stop! I'm talking to you. Yes? Well, you can't just leave this out here all night, you know. You don't know who's gonna come along. It's a little late for that kind of thinking, and I have to work tonight. Good afternoon. That is not a very helpful attitude, Mr. Walker. We're trying to help you, you know. I've spent a lot of time trying to get this business cleared up, not to mention money. I think we should work out exactly what we're going to do now. I haven't decided yet. Good afternoon. Well, what's your financial situation like? [ Sighs ] I have a little laid by. I planned to use it on my wedding, but I guess it'll have to wait. Mm. Mr. Walker, let me give you some advice. You spend the money on your wedding. Build yourself a home and a family where you can find some comfort. And just forget that some damn white man caused you offense. And that's your advice? That's my advice, and I pray you take it to heart. "Just forget it"? Is that it? I've spent my whole life forgetting. You're a young man. You better start learning now. Learning what-- how to be a nigger? Mr. Walker, I'll thank you to leave. I have some charity cases you know nothing of. I got clients with real problems-- starvation, illness, dispossession. Yes, I want justice for our people. Yes, I do. I want it so bad, I can taste it. If you think I'll go to Westchester County pleading the behalf of a colored man... that somebody dirtied his fancy car, you are very much mistaken. Now, please, you take this... and leave my office. I'm afraid you can't file a complaint against a volunteer fireman. Why not? Because they're not an employee of the city. We have no jurisdiction over them. Well, then whose jurisdiction are they under? Well, they got it wrong. You're gonna have to go back to the police department... and tell them I said you should file your complaint with them. That's instructions from the county clerk. I don't care what they told you at the county clerk's office. Then tell me what I'm supposed to do. Just explain to me exactly how I should go about it. The first thing you can do is go to the county clerk... and tell the son of a bitch not to send you back here! Now-- now, listen. All I'm saying is that I want you to talk to Mr. Walker. [ Sniffles ] I did. He got hisself all crazy over this thing. He ain't got no time for me now. [ Sobbing ] But, uh, that's what I'm saying. And we can't keep you here forever. I do my work around the house, if that's what you want. No, I only want one thing. I want you to make Mr. Walker understand... that there's absolutely no legal means... for redressing this thing. Why are you telling her that? That's not what the lawyers said. Will you let me handle this, please? They said it would take a lot of time and money, but they never said that there was no chance. I am trying to present this situation... in a way she's capable of understanding! But you're lying to her. Get out! I told you to get out of here! Sarah? Sarah, now, listen to me. Listen. All right. Now, you can tell Mr. Walker that if he'll just marry you... without any more of this nonsense, I'll pay to have his automobile repaired. That ain't gonna do no good... [ Panting ] 'cause he say it got to be the firemen. Oh, for pity's sake. What difference does it make? I told him-- I told him I'd clean it. I'd clean it. But he said no. Well, if he's not willing to see reason, then it's your responsibility to do something about it. Do you understand? Uh-huh. It's your responsibility now. [ Baby Crying ] [ Crying Continues ] Shh.

Take that one out too! - [ Old Man ] My God! All right. Come on. All right. Come on. Straighten up, Willie. Are you ready, Mr. Conklin? Ready? Ready for what? What do you mean? You know that someone's been asking for you, don't you? What is this? It's a joke, huh? It's a joke, right? No joke, Willie. The library over there is worth millions. - So? - And people keep telling me... you're a worthless piece of slime. Hold him back! Can't talk to me like that! Shut up, Willie. You're going to help us now. You're going to talk to that troublemaker, and I mean talk hard like you never talked before. Because he wants you, Willie. And if you can't make him change his demands, he's gonna get you. I don't have to do this. I want a lawyer. - Waldo. Library, please. - I got my rights, you know! Walker? Speaking. We have the fire chief for you. Send him over. Take it. [ Gasping ] Release him. Hey, listen to me, you crazy nigger. I've had enough of you, you hear me? You can't be thinking that they're gonna give me to the likes of you. No. I know you-- I-I know you ain't that stupid. No. You're one of them smart niggers. So how'd you ever own a car like that, huh? So what do you say we just talk this thing over? Yeah, I'm ready to do that. I'll go halfway with you on this thing. I don't mind. Sort of like you come on over, we'll sit down. Have a nice talk, huh? What do you say? Look, the commissioner here says he'll leave us alone. Gave me his word. What do you say, Walker? Goddamn it, say something! It was a joke, damn you! Can't you even take a joke? You can't talk to that nigger bastard! Jesus to hell! Say something, would you? Let me speak to Waldo. He wants to talk to you. Waldo. - Send him over. - Walker, listen to me-- [ Line Disconnects ] What? No. What do you think you're doing? No! You're not taking me over there! Let go of me, you goons! Let go of me! You want to find your houses burning? [ Indistinct ] You'll see! You'll see! Touch one of us, you mess with every fireman in the country! Can't somebody please tell me what is going on? Can you just give me a rough idea? [ Whispering ] There's not gonna be a fireman left in sight. Good. Tell him I want to see him right away. Would everyone please leave the room? Thank you. Gentlemen? Hurry, please. Mr. Elliott, please. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. The commissioner will see you now. Jim. [ Phone Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] Yes? Yes, I'll speak to him. Um, Mr. Walker? Hello, sir. How are you? Fine. Um-- I'd like very much to have a word with you. Would it be all right if I came over? Yes. That'll be fine. It's your brother-in-law. He wants me to come over. Now you know I can't take the responsibility. Yes. Yes, I know. - I want to go. - Okay. You're a brave man. May I ask you a question, Mr. Walker? I can't stop you from asking. Do you remember my brother-in-law-- the young man you met at my house? Yes. Yes, I believe I do. -Was he ever in touch with you? -Is that why you came over here? Well, in-- in part, yes. What's the other part? Well, I... hoped, since we've... known each other under better circumstances-- I hoped I might prevail on you to change your-- on you to ch-- to change your mind. I haven't seen your brother-in-law. But you can go back and tell Mr. Waldo that I have changed my mind. I'm ready to offer him a swap-- Conklin's life for the freedom of my men. All he's got to do is deliver my automobile... to the front door of this library. And when it's dark, my men will use it to get out of here. When they're safe... and sure they haven't been followed, they'll call me here. And I'll come out with my hands up. [ Man ] Hey, Coalhouse! You be quiet, you hear? Tell Mr. Waldo that if he plays it straight with me... that's exactly how it will happen. - You remember that? - Yes. - I th-- Yeah, I think so. - Good. Hey, brother. What is this? You playing games with us? Why you sayin' like we leavin' without you? You know that ain't gonna happen. [ Chuckles ] Zeke, you're a hothead. You gotta calm down or else your brains are gonna burn up. Well, you said it. I mean, Coalhouse, didn't you say-- didn't you say that you were gonna stay right here, huh? I said a lot of things. [ Chuckles ] Then you're messin' with 'em. You-- you got somethin' else in mind. You see that, Zeke? When you calm down, your brain starts to worki'' just fine. Yeah. Yeah! I don't get it. I just don't get it. It doesn't make sense to me. He seemed perfectly rational and coherent to me. Well, maybe he thinks he can sneak into the car and escape with the rest of them. Well, it'll be night, it'll be dark. He can't leave the library alone. That's all he's got. The second we know it's empty, we can blast that car to bits. No. We can't do it. We can't buy his terms. Why not? Look. Let's say his men got away. All right. There he is, sitting on the detonator and he knows he's a dead man. The only freedom he's got left is how to die. He can let us fry him in the electric chair, or he can go "bang" and carry the library to heaven with him. I disagree. Why? I believe he means what he says. Well, that's damn big of you, but I'm afraid your belief isn't the iron-plated guarantee that I need here! Well, what if I was in the library... until Mr. Walker gave himself up? Would that be sufficient guarantee? Be a guarantee that you're as crazy as he is. Are you on the level? Yes! You're saying... you'd volunteer to go over there and get yourself blown up with that crazy buck? I believe if you keep your word and let his men go free, I'll have nothing to fear. Why, for Christ's sake? What are you to him? I'm no judge of these things, Mr. Waldo. I know the man isn't responsible for his actions, but in everything he's done there's been a certain logic... and, you'll excuse me for saying it, an integrity. I think he wants to... be heard. That's all. I think that's what he's wanted all along. If he blows himself up, his story will die with him. I think he wants to bring his case to court. - Library. - [ Phone Ringing ] - Yes? - Walker, I'll accept your new conditions... if we can have a man in there with you until you give yourself up. All right then. Send him over. Fine, fine. Thank you, Mr. Walker. I'm looking forward to meeting you. That's it. Keep your fingers crossed, gentlemen. I'll believe it all when it happens. Tell the militia to back off. Keep them on standby. Yes, sir. And get a new Model T and check that it matches. Right. Yes, sir. Good luck. Captain, may I have a word with you? Yes, sir. Mr. Waldo, may I use the phone? I want to call my family. Of course. What do you think? That's okay. [ Phone Ringing ] Essex and Sussex Hotel. May I help you? Room 216 and 18. No, I'm sorry. They checked out this morning, sir. Yes, sir. I'm quite sure. No. They didn't leave any message. You're welcome. The area for two blocks around J.P. Morgan's library... is now an emergency zone. Gentlemen, the men you are following must never suspect, repeat, never suspect, that their car is under surveillance. And no one makes a move until you've got the full go ahead from headquarters. Understand? You shouldn't have any trouble spotting the target car, unless there are a lot of new Model Ts full of colored people driving around all night. [ Laughter ] [ Whistle Blowing ] Coalhouse, they're bringin' it! Look! [ Indistinct Chatter ] [ Door Opens ] Turn off all the lights. Take this. It's the telephone number here. The minute you're sure you're safe and haven't been followed, I want you to call me. - Wait a minute. - I'm staying. What? What? You heard me. We ain't goin' nowhere without you, brother. We just can't do that. Think about it. If I get out of here, I'd be hunted every day of my life. And that's no kind of life for a man. Is it? But no one's seen you. No one knows what you look like. Tomorrow you'll be free in the streets. And you can start gettin' folks to talkin'. Now that's got to be better than five dead niggers. Coalhouse, you-- Look! You all stay here, and we're all dead men. Then what was all of this for? You all the only life I got left. Now go on. Get on outta here! Go! [ Engine Idling ] How's my baby doin'? Fine. - He said any words yet? - No. Oh, I-- I mean, I don't know. I... haven't heard him. If I was in prison, I wonder if they'd let him come and visit me. I don't see why not. Um... you may find this hard to believe right now, but I believe-- I really do believe... that your situation, legally speaking, isn't... at all hopeless. You think so? Mmm. You're an impressive and articulate man. Certainly nothing like people have been led to expect. I'd like to believe you. I really would like that. Mr. Walker, are you planning... to let me leave this place alive? [ Horse Carriage, Car Approaching ] Sir? Sir, we lost them. Where? We had them as far as 34th and Lexington. They disappeared before the next lookout post. That's one block! Yes, sir. Son of a b-- [ Phone Ringing ] Y-You sure you weren't followed? Good. Good. Don't worry about me. I'll be fine. You all take care now, you hear? All right. Are-- are they safe? Yeah. Well, shouldn't we... uh... tell them... that we're-- we're coming? Yeah. You go on ahead. Tell 'em I'll be right out. - Well-- - Just go on. I'll be with you. - Don't-- - Go. [ Stammering ] Don't you think it would be... a better idea if we-- Get the hell out of here! Don't you understand anything, white man? Oh, damn it! Damn it! This is it! I know this is it! [ Walker ] Lord, I'd hoped I'd have the courage to know... what I should do now. You must see how sick at heart I've been... and how I've performed this thing with little appetite. I'd hoped... you'd reveal to me along the way... why you put such a rage in my heart. Tell me what to do now. Please. [ Sighs ] God, tell me what to do. Fire. Sir? Fire. [ Indistinct Chattering ] Champagne! Bye-bye! [ Boy ] Extra! Extra! Read all about it!
