...and gross sales At $13 million in the last fiscal year. In advertising and promotional expenditures of 2 million, $845,000 were reported. These expenditures were primarily... By primarily, I mean about 96% of these expenditures, Were for Richter's two main retail brands. These brands made up over 85% Of the company profits in the last fiscal year, An increase of some 14% from the previous year. This increase is based on sales of $16,800,000. Total sales were up only $200,000 In the last fiscal year, Even with an increase in advertising expenditures of $872,000. So, while the sales of Wh-Whiz Bam And Cherry Poppie Balls ar-ar-are up. Uh, sales for their retail brand, Chocorama... Yeah, Smith. Gumball. Would you repeat that? Gumball. Ok, let's wrap it up for today, gentlemen. Thank you. Gumball! Aah! Will you take a look at this for me? Here we go. To him who accepts the challenge, To him who risks all... Comes the satisfaction of victory And a sense of physical well-being in return for... I want you to get this... In return for hardship, exhaustion, discomfort. Ponos. Thank you very much. Hi, Sam. Bannon? It's on. We're a go. Look. I... I've been giving this matter a lot of thought, and you don't have anything to lose. I mean, to you, this thing is just a stunt. I've got a position at this university, I've got a shot at tenure. All I have to do is stay out of trouble A couple of more years, I'll be set for life. I can't risk that. It's not a risk. It's a challenge. Hey, get out of the way! What's the matter with you? What are you, deaf, you hippie freak? I can't eat with all this noise going on. Come on. Let's take him. Car 34, come in. Uh, this is car 34. Over. We got a telegram for you clowns. Does, uh, "gumball" mean anything to you? Uh, negative. 10-4. Let's go. That's beside the point... I got that chicken in the oven. Hi, Oscar. The kids' clothes are all laid out. Ok, don't worry. Just have a good time. I will. Bye, Osc. See ya. Have a good time. You be good. Listen to your daddy. You would think she was planning the D-Day Invasion instead of a weekend in the country. Attention, please. All passengers holding tickets... Excuse me. On TWA flight number 132 to New York... Hi. Smoking. Be careful with the liquor cabinet. Yes. Yes. Yes. Andy, you know how often my wife Tried to get me to get rid of this car? Well, that's German machinery for you. The car outlasted her. Sedately, Barney... As befits our years and station in life. Of course. Ladies and gentlemen... Ace Preston, Mr. "Guts" himself, Is in the white car revving up. He'll attempt the death-defying Russian T-Bone... a nose-dive into oblivion. And there he goes, And where he stops, nobody knows! Ladies and gentlemen... Ace Preston on the high speed. Go, Ace. Go! A T-Bone served by Mr. "Guts." Whoo! Hey. What do you say, buddy? I didn't have time to change. Aren't you excited about this? No. I'll be glad when it's over. Well, I don't expect to live forever. Don't worry, kid, you won't. Excuse me. May I give you a flower? I'm a stranger in this country. And I've never seen such a beautiful woman in all my life. You see, I would like to know, maybe you could inform me of a hotel. Here we are, old buddy. New York, New York. The Big Apple! I feel ready. I'm pumping up. I've been pumped up. Yeah. Ah, Franco. Prego. Come sta? Fine. Thank you. Good. And you? How's the bambino? She's-a full-a gas, she's-a wait for you. Hey, you make a good Italian. Lieutenant Roscoe? Mike Kapowsky, NYPD. How are you? The car's outside. I'll take you downtown. I got a brother-in-law in L.A. Two martis and a double man. Gumball. They're coming in now. All of them. I'm going to stay here on the stakeout. It's 9:05. I'll check in again at 10:00. Graves. In through there, please. Uh, right through that door, There's a banquet room. Thank you. It was just a misunderstanding. Oh, that's what you call it? I call it a lie! Well, it's after 9:30. That's the deadline. Should we close it up, Mr. Banner? Yeah. Put Fred on the door. I want that room sealed. Ladies... Gentlemen... You have been selected because you have the necessary skills. You are here because you have the determination to succeed. Now, it won't be as easy as last year. There are some who will use any means to try and stop us. Some of you won't make it. For those of you who do, there'll be no glory, no headlines... but just a few magic hours, flat out against the red line, with no catalytic converter, and no 55-mile-an-hour speed limit. Ladies and gentlemen... The Gumball Rally has begun! Yay! Yeah! Yeah! Whoo! Bravo! Now, for those of you who've never done this before, I think I'd better go over the rules. Uh, the first thing to remember is that there are no rules. The first vehicle to reach the parking lot At the Queen Mary in Long Beach is the winner... the unofficial winner... 'cause this is an unofficial race, And so it follows that none of us are really in this race. We don't want any, uh, civilian involvement. No accidents... Please? Remember it's 2,900 miles. That.. 34 hours and 11 minutes... is the record... Set last year by our dear friend Mr. Bannon. Now, I know we all ought to get some rest tonight. Uh, but... may I? I'd like to propose a toast. To internal combustion... And wind in the face. You know, I think Roscoe's Got a grudge against you, Smitty, from last year. Why do I always get blamed for everything anyway? Because you're a schemer. It's going to be a lot different from last year anyway. Yeah, I noticed. You brought a real ringer with you this time. A what? You know. Your friend... Franco. What do you mean? What's he ever won? Le Mans, Grand Prix de Monaco? What does that mean? He's coming along 'cause he's a real nice guy. Don't you think it's a bit like trying to kill a butterfly with a hammer? Oh, stop, will you? You make me feel ashamed of myself. Aw, Smitty, don't worry. Sam and I will do our best. Yeah, but isn't it funny, though, you know? Sometimes in life when your best just isn't... quite good enough, you know? You're still bitter, huh? No. No, I'm not. Oh, yes, you are. No. I'm... I'm going to win, that's all. Don't get overconfident. Um... Let's, uh... Flip to see who takes care of Roscoe, hmm? Oh, yeah. Right. Tails. Oop. Wrong. Oh, no. Why do I always get him? I'll take care of him the morning of the race. Mr. McAllister, Mr. Donohue! Mr. McAllister. Mr. McAllister, Mr. Donohue! Here you are, sirs. Barney, I'm hungry. Oh! I'm sorry. Bull's-eye! Hit the trunk, old buddy. Aha! Lookie here. Extra uniforms... All of them for along the way. Look at this. Police decals. All you gotta do is just stick them on the doors. Hey, give me a hand with the lights. Give it a try. Oh. Can you imagine? Do you believe that? Hey, guys, listen to this. Look, I been figuring. With 200 gallons of gas back here, We don't have to make one damn stop. Not one. Ever seen anything like this before? Wait'll you hear it run, man. I got that computer information on the route... weather and traffic and the road conditions. What's the matter, Jose? Nothing, Mr. Bannon. I'm ok. Hey, don't let all this stuff get you down. Hey, I'm fine. What do I care? If I wanted to go, I could go. It's a free country, right? This whole race is unofficial, So I'm as unofficial as you are, So if I wanted to go, I'd go. If I had a car. It's my girlfriend, you see. She tells me yesterday, No more dates on the subway. I tell you something. In this country, you ain't nothing... If... if you got no wheels. Oh, I don't know. You been on the roads, lately? I think the age of the motorcar is over. Hey, Mr. Bannon, Is it ok if I take a few hours off? Sure, th... Ok, kill it. Kill it! Why don't you hurry up? I gonna have to redo everything you've done. Gee, Mike, what did you think this was, A vintage car event? Well, Smitty, Some things get meaner as they get older. Well, it's real cute. Very fast. Very uncomfortable. That's good, though. That's macho. That's good for you. That old Smitty. We've been competing in everything... Sports, school, girls. 20 years of competition can sometimes get out of hand. Why didn't he buy the rest of the Ferrari team while he was at it? I'm not so sure he didn't. Where's that Italian flash, anyway? Franco? Hasn't showed up all day. He's probably resting up. Yeah. Getting his plugs cleaned. Vrroom. Vrroom, vrroom, vrroom. I must go now... My darling. Will you write? If I can. I mean... I never met anyone who was going to Borneo. It is not a pleasure trip. Be careful, Franco. I cannot do the work I must and also be careful. Then be lucky. That's better. ♪ Placida e l'onda ♪ ♪ prospero ♪ ♪ e il vento ♪ ♪ venete all'agile ♪ ♪ berchetta mia ♪ ♪ santa lucia ♪ ♪ santa ♪ ♪ lucia ♪ This is Red Fox to Barracuda. Red Fox to Barracuda. Now, I figure they're gonna leave late tonight or early tomorrow morning. As soon as I see them go, I'll let you know, then I want roadblocks on every bridge and tunnel going west. Do you copy? Now, as the contract reads, No driving after 6 P.M., not to exceed 55 miles per hour. You're bonded? Of course. Mr. Blakely is a connoisseur of fine automobiles. But for California driving, he's especially fond of this one. Min ga! You may go. Sure. Gently. Gently! Drive carefully. Jesus, it's a hit. We still haven't got food. What are we going to eat? Oh, Franco. Where you been? Your mother called. She's been looking for you everywhere. Now you make-a jokes on my mother, huh? No, no, no. About your mother. Not on your mother, Franco. I wouldn't get on your mother. Just-a like in Monte Carlo... Jokes. You insult-a me. You insult-a my family. You insult-a my country, my honor! My dignity you insult! I warned you... but you wouldn't listen! No more jokes! You see this-a? No more jokes! Ha ha ha ha ha. Very good, Franco. You like? Yeah. Where is the... the professor!

Let's get some rest. Hmm? It's done, brother. Go. Okay. Get ready. All right, ladies and gentlemen, start your engines! And now, my friend, The first-a rule of Italian driving. What's-a behind me is not important. Well, buddy, here's to us and that we get there first. Why don't you give New York one of those famous rebel yells of yours before we hit the street?

Turn it on! What, is this the switch? That's it! Hey, maybe we should... wait a minute. Christ, if this thing works... Some city you got here. I didn't know what size to bring. I said better too big than too little. Did you get any of them? We didn't put it out. We were waiting to hear from you. They snipped my radio. How about your car? The wheels fell off. Oh, those guys sound mean. Take me to the airport. Now? Hey, you got to learn to roll with the punches, Roscoe. La-la-la-la-la-la-la! Harold, how you been? Hey, that's Crazy Harold. How long do we have to drive anyway? If we're lucky, about 35 hours. Where we going, Cuba? No, Long Beach, California. Stop. No, I can't. No, no. Stop. I mean, you can't. Pull over to the side. Just stop and let me out. I forgot to tell you something. I'm in a race. I don't care what you're in. I'm getting out. Pull over to the side, or I'm jumping. No, you ain't... No, wait a minute. Close that door! Take it easy now. Just take it easy. We'll get there. From the garage to the Jersey Turnpike... 6 minutes, 58 seconds. That's 15 seconds better than last year. Terrific! You got the snooper working? Get a weather report on the CB. You got it! All you truckers out there, This is Big Ben in Jolly Green. We got a little light snow coming in from Pennsylvania. Roll on Yellow Camaro Exact change. 25 cents. Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo! Well, we're heading south. We got plenty of open road. You're a spastic. I was also all-state in basketball. That's it. I don't have any more quarters. So get out of the car. You got a quarter? Come on! Get out of the car. Aw, shit. Get that tin can out of the way! Where do you think it is? Under the car. Under the car. If I was a quarter, where would I be? Where'd it go? Pull on through. Park in section "D." How about explaining that last move, buddy? What's a Smokey the Bear? Highway patrol. Plain brown wrapper? Uh... city policeman. Oh... unmarked car? Police car. County mountie? Uh... county sheriff. And a local yokel. City policeman. You're so smart, the next time out, I'm going to make sure you get a driver's license. Well, happy hunting, Roscoe. Sorry about the pants. And you call yourself New York's finest. Well, I got you all out of New York. See you later, sir Roscoe. Taxi! The crusade is straight ahead! Our crew is going ahead in a plane. They got spare parts, everything we're going to need. I've got all these stops here marked and coordinated. Beautiful! What the hell are you doing? Ah, she is-a magnificent! This is a race, man! Some things are more important than winning. Maybe the float's stuck. Maybe it's the humidity. England is humid. I feel like Moses at the parting of the Red Sea! Hey, man. This is no good. What's the matter, huh? Well, take a look. It's too easy. Yeah, yeah. It's too easy until somebody nails us. This is flying lasagna coming in to the oven. Do you copy? 10-4. The oven is hot. See that gas station? Let's pull off there. Let's get-a ready. One man... Brilliant. Brilliant! Thank you. Preston! What do you want? I got to take a leak. No, thank you. I'm not going to stop so you can take a piss. There's a bottle in the back. I can't do that. I'm not going to stop until we need gas. I can't hold it. I'm telling you, use the bottle. I tried this once going 60. Didn't work then. Well, if you're coordinated, Once you start... you won't stop. Hey! Come on! I'm getting this all over my hands! My hands are wet! You're a dumb son of a bitch sometimes. Don't know why I even hang around with you or anything. I wouldn't have done this to you! Those dirty son of a bitches. I hope there's tough justice in Illinois. I want to nail them, sheriff, and this ought to do it. Then what? Them I'm going to turn them over to you, and you can throw away the key. You'll be doing this country a favor. That's what! Now we can start running. How's our time? Right on schedule! I wonder what old Roscoe is doing now. Developing an ulcer. Ha ha ha ha! Hey, steady, huh'? She is a-happy. They're coming! Goddamn. Was that Roscoe? I wonder if he set us up. Oh, terrific. Oh. I got them now. Jeez, I'd love to see the look on their faces. How fast are you going? Just-a, a-100. Well, let's hit it. Avanti! Thank you, my dear friend. Jesus! We're going over 100 knots! Well, come on, step it up, buddy. Hey, what's the matter? Sir, we can't catch them. He must be going 180 miles per hour. We don't even have a fixed-wing airplane that could catch that. Ha ha ha ha! Now what? Take me to the airport. It's a handsome design. I wish it ran. I'm going to tell you something, Harry, this thing handles like a pig. Hey, I think it'll get better. Wait till we use up some of the gas. This thing's a bear to handle. What's up, Harry? I don't know, but did we break anything? I don't know. Maybe we'd better stop. Are you kidding, stop? I guess we're all right. Go on. Hey, look! What the hell's the matter with him? I think he's having a nightmare. You don't see? Jesus Christ! You can't outrun it, you asshole! Pull this thing off the road! Whoa! I hope you learn from this experience. I made this drive once before in 1946 in a Mercury coupe. Is that so? Ah, but it's different now. Yes, newer roads, older bodies. Yeah, too much too late. But if I have to die, Andy, I want to die trying. Good. Would you say that man Lapchik has a certain joie de vivre? I'd say he's possessed of a severe case of masochism. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! I think it was a meteor. That's what it was. You okay? You okay? Yeah, I think so. Who's that guy? Yeah! Whoa! Keep your eye on the road. Just getting my rhythm up. Keep up the speed, will ya? Well, I am keeping up the speed. It's just so boring out here, my mind's starting to drift. This is America, Gibson, and America's not boring. Yeah? Well, motel signs, cafe signs, one-Way signs, do not enter signs, and every other kind of sign, it all looks the same to me. Back there, we saw a reptile farm. That's more right down my alley. Get my hands on a boa contractor. The word is constrictor! And don't slow down. Move it! Why did I pick him for a mechanic? 'Cause I'm the best, that's why. What in the name of farm corn did he come from? I told you to keep your eyes on the road! How I'm supposed to keep my eyes on the road, have a good time, think about my girlfriend, and do all this, huh? Tell me! You're a product of too much inbreeding. Ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! We did it! It's those damn fake cops. Ha ha ha ha! Will you move it now! Damn it if you can't take a joke. I want to go home. You say you want to be a movie star, that you want to be somebody. I mean, you take acting classes, you take dance classes, you work hard. Where the hell you think you're going to be discovered... standing on a corner in queens? Huh? Baby, listen. Now... in Hollywood. Do you really think so? Baby, I... I, I really like you. You should try to be nice to me. You know, you should try to... to understand. Oh. Huh? I do. What are you doing? What are you doing? Aah! Just take the wheel! You're crazy! Aah! Hey, you guys! Jesus Christ! Whitey, you okay, boy? Talk to me! Hello out there. I'm a-coming in from the cactus patch. Rolling on to Derby City. Got smokeys all over 40 giving out green stamps as you ride the Cloverleaf into the Buckeye. Just put the hammer down and watch out for two little beavers in a black speed boat coming your way, and they are moving. Do you copy? It's that damn Smith. He's the one thinks up all this mess. He's a damned overaged juvenile delinquent, and I want him. I want to suspend his license in perpetuity. Who's Smith? The thorn in my side, captain. The cloud over my head. Baker spotted them about 5 miles back. They should be here soon. They're flying. He must be doing over 160. I've never saw anything so damn fast. I got them! Get everybody in position. See that truck up here? Pull in behind it, and blow the horn. You're fantastic! I thought you'd like that. Bravo! Bravo! Maybe they stopped. Send a car up the road. What's up? Any speeders pass you back there? Nobody passed me within 15 miles. Okay, get out of here! What happened, somebody rob a bank or something? None of your damn business! Just move it out! There's no sign of them anywhere. Well, they couldn't just have vanished into thin air. I'll be a son of a bitch. Where are you going? Follow me! Open it up. Open it! Are you happy? Get it out of here. It's so easy on these Interstates! Can you imagine making this trip at 55 miles an hour? 55 miles an hour is unsafe. It's boring. That's why it's unsafe. It's fast enough to kill you, but it's slow enough to make you think you're safe. What time have you got? 6:00. Great! 12 hours! 1/3 of the trip! I think it's terminal. This is Casey Kasem on America's Top 40... ...in Colorado Springs, you're listening to Casey Kasem's America's Top 40 on KYFM, where the temperature is now 34 degrees and dropping. ♪ America's Top 40 ♪ Hey, hey, fella?

I'm old enough to do a lot of things, mister. Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you? Hey, slow that thing down! What do you want to do... play doctor? Ohh! I'm in love! Sweetheart... if you catch me... you can have me. Are you kidding? Go! Go! This is a dream come true! Get on it! Go! That was really dumb. Oh, they'll never catch up with us. Drive, Earl! Drive! Well, goddamn. Franco, you're missing all the fun. Vroom, vroom. Mmm. Goddamn! Where's Franco? We must have lost him somewhere. It's a difficult thing to think about at 2:00 in the morning. Well, I guess I can ease up now. Feeling better? Oh, my god. Oh! Well? Andy, I need an inspiration. Yes, it's that time of the morning. Something to make the blood hot. What would you say to a bit of Henry V? Oh, you're a mind reader. Ha ha! "Once more into the breach, dear friends, once more." "O, follow your spirit. "And on this charge cry, "God for Harry, England, and Saint George!" Ice! I hope Lapchik the mad Hungarian sees that. He came off right here! He's got to be down there. Man, he's got to be down there. Hey! Hey, fella, are you all right? They're going to be leaving Nevada on Interstate 15. That's the way they're going to be coming, and they'll be coming through this junction. You haven't had too much luck before. Yeah, but they were forewarned. They've got CB radios. They could listen to everything we say. I mean, there was no way around it. I can't understand how they did it, but they did it. This time, it's going to be planned. Clearly planned. Boy, you really want them bad. This is Roscoe's last stand! Don't let go of the accelerator. For you, you lovely American animal. Remember Franco. The quickest man I know. Bye! Bye! Bella! Bella! What the hell? She can-a drive, huh? Yeah. Bannon and Graves got by last night. Let them have their brief moment of glory. We'll be in Nevada pretty soon. Nevada! Las Vegas! Civilization. The dancing girls with the bouncing boom-booms. Oh, shut up, will you, with that? Hey, what's that car? That's a Rolls-Royce, you asshole. Hey. Ain't she sweet? She looks lonely. Wahoo! Yeah!
