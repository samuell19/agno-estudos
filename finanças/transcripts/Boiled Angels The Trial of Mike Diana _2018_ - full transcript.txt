(ominous music) (pencil scratching)a (bright instrumental music) - [Mike] I'm dying for your sins. - [Jello] So-called artist Mike Diana is going to jail for three years due to his issues number seven and number eight of "Boiled Angel." The good citizens of Pinellas County and surrounding counties burned copies of "Boiled Angel" and an effigy of Mr. Diana outside the courthouse. Prosecutors said that Mr. Diana is responsible for the moral breakdown of society and has been restricted from going within 200 feet of any schools or parks where young children may be. (television smashes) - [Mike] Fuck those motherfuckers, man! Don't those dumb fucks realise that I use my art as outlet for all my anger? Maybe I should just act like the evil monster that they are making me out to be. I'll show you fucks! See this little brat? This kid is trash now, he's fucked. (baby wailing) This kid would've grown up to be a Florida state prosecutor or a newscaster. Shit, maybe I'm giving you people the wrong idea with this comic. You have to understand that I don't want to hurt anyone. Hell, I wouldn't even hurt a little insect. - [Announcer] The trial of Mike Diana is aired on live TV all across the state. Diana showed up with his stripper girlfriend! - [Reporter] In court today, the jury reached a unanimous decision finding Diana not guilty of publishing lewd and obscene material. So, Mr. Diana, how do you feel about the jury's verdict and will you now continue in your efforts to draw and publish? (gunshot fires) Jesus fucking Christ, Mike Diana has just been shot dead on live TV! (gunshot, screaming) And the lamb of God that killed him has just blown his own brains out also! - [Announcer] Mike's body is wrapped in old newspapers rather than a coffin due to the fact he spent all his money on lawyer's fees. The holy lamb of God rests in a gold plated and diamond studded coffin with a big American flag draped over it. Mike's spirit spends eternity in Hell where he is forced to draw cute pictures of flowers and puppies. The spirit of the lamb of God is given his wings and halo and flies around Heaven eating Big Macs and Chicken McNuggets. Mike is buried in an isolated graveyard. Only the insects come to visit his grave. (crickets chirp) - [Reporter] Michael Diana emerged from a Dallas County courtroom this afternoon. - [Reporter] Michael Diana was arraigned today. He claims efforts to publish a magazine called-- - [Reporter] Michael Diana today entered pleas of not guilty to three counts of promoting obscenity. Diana publishes a magazine called Boiled Angels. - [Reporter] A comic book filled with sadism, masochism, and perversion. (energetic music) - It's not any innocent soft pornography. This is hardcore psychopathic material. - Here we have another sort of monster being fellated by a disembodied head. - The prosecutors don't want to acknowledge Mike as an artist. They want to treat this as some sort of corruptive foul sausage that Mike was moving through the mails. - It's just drawings. He's not a rapist. He's not a murderer. He doesn't even harm a fly. This guy is the nicest man I've ever known. - The whole theme of this, of number eight was cannibalism. - There's definitely though a strain in his work of, he's like class clown. (babbling) - I don't know if I've read the whole thing, but yes, I looked at 'em and to me, art is art. - I told him, draw things that when you look at it, it makes you happy. Looking at somebody getting their brains blown out, it's not something that makes most people happy. - [Reporter] The Concerned Women of America and another group called Citizens Opposing Pornography say they will maintain a court watch to keep the pressure on Diana. - Jesus loves Michael. He'll forgive him. - Teenage boys are always drawing dicks. (bell chimes) And here's a guy just because he's printing it up in a little mini comic that clearly wasn't being sold at the local 7-Eleven, it seems so strange that people became so freaked out about it. - He was very scared, you know? And he made every right to be. - It's not always the function of art to soothe or to simply depict comfortable situations. Sometimes art has to depict things that are very offensive, very horrifying. This case was a perfect example of obscenity law dealt in laboratory sterility. - The idea that somebody in, at that time and this day and age, could be arrested for drawing comics seemed to me absolutely and utterly obscene. - They did want to put me in jail for three years because of it. - Because you're a danger to society. - Yeah. - Well, I think you are. I think you know you're a punk. (gushing) - Hi, I'm Mike Diana. I'm the only comic book artist ever convicted of obscenity in the United States. That happened in 1994 here in Florida. (pencil scratching) (heavy punk music) (paper fluttering) ♪ You want me to kiss your ass ♪ ♪ Well bend over buddy, here comes my foot ♪ ♪ I don't need your crying shit ♪ (siren wailing) ♪ Jesters rise and take a fist ♪ ♪ Bite it, you scum ♪ ♪ Bite it, you scum ♪ ♪ Bite it, you scum ♪ ♪ Here I come ♪ ♪ Bite it ♪ ♪ Dumb fucking sucking whore ♪ - [Jello] In a small town in Florida, artist Mike Diana created two handmade zines so full of potent imagery that people wanted to put him in jail. Shocking, provocative, offensive, and often disturbingly hilarious, Mike Diana's art was also seen by many as simply obscene. Here then is what happens when one man's art becomes another man's obscenity. (suspenseful music) But first, a brief detour. - The first time I saw an EC was at Sam's Candy Store. It was January 1951. I was nine years old and my aunt Leona had taken me to the candy store to get some ice cream, and while she was negotiating with the ice cream, I was looking at the racks of comic books and standing out was "The Vault of Horror" number 17, I'll never forget it, it had a werewolf on the cover and I had never seen a werewolf. So I bought this comic book and I knew that it was something special, something for kids and something that we really didn't want the adults in on. - [Jello] In an effort to boost sagging sales, William Gaines, the publisher of EC Comics, introduced a line of outstanding horror and crime titles that forever changed the landscape of comic book culture. Kids loved them, parents hated them. - EC Comics, they were the best and they all had morals. Each story had a moral. Everybody that got their comeuppance deserved to get it. (gunshot fires) - [Jello] EC horror titles were so popular that they opened the door for hundreds of horror and crime comics from other publishers that quickly flooded the comic book racks. Adults, however, feared that somehow horror and crime comics would seriously damage children's minds. Suddenly, comics were a serious threat. (bright music) - [Announcer] There are no economic or racial lines to the comic book threat. But they're not reading anything constructive. They're reading stories devoted to adultery, to sexual perversion, to horror, to the most despicable of crimes. Horror and crime comics upset kids. You can see the tension develop as the story gets more gruesome and if it's a bad one, the kid is a mass of jangled nerves by the time he's through it. (dramatic music) Ah, he wasn't gonna hit ya. He just wanted to know what it would feel like to almost knock someone's brains out. - [Jello] Leading the charge against the comics was psychologist Fredric Wertham. - Fredric Wertham was a child psychologist who had done interesting work with the poor in Harlem. He wrote a book that became notorious in its persecution of comic books and it was called, "Seduction of the Innocent." For parts of it life, a Book of the Month Club selection, so it had a wide audience. His case basically was that reading comic books turned children into juvenile delinquents. It was false science. It was poorly reasoned, but it was a very influential book and it scared the hell out of parents. - [Jello] After first captivating the nation with his televised hearings on organised crime, senator Estes Kefauver zeroed in on comics with a 1954 hearing in New York featuring EC publisher William Gaines as a witness. - It would be just as difficult to explain the harmless thrill of a horror story to a Dr. Wertham as it would be to explain the sublimity of love to a frigid old maid. But do we think our children so evil, so vicious, so simple minded, that it takes but a comic magazine story of murder to set them to murder, or robbery to set them to robbery? (flames crackling) - We were also aware of comic book burnings, and these occurred in various towns across the country, and we knew that the jig was up at a certain point. It was all gonna come to an end, and it did with the Comics Code Authority. - [Jello] Panicking, comic book publishers quickly created a comic book code, which gutted their books of anything objectionable, horror and crime comics disappeared. Publishers folded, hundreds of artists were out of work. EC killed their entire line of comics, except for "Mad," which is a whole other story. And for all their trouble, juvenile delinquency still plagued America. - I was reading EC before the comic code. (chuckles) That's how old I am, and then all of a sudden came the comic code and we had to buy them underground. We had to pay more for them. There were only certain guys that would sell 'em, and it was like, you know, a minor version of, where do you get your dope? - At a certain point, I started thinking also about the arguments that were being made against comics from all sides, all borders, and I took it into my mind that maybe I shouldn't have these comics. Maybe they were harming me. Maybe they were bad for me and I said, "That's it, these comics are not wholesome. "They're not a good idea." I took them all, all my ECs and threw them in the garbage, and they, (laughs) they wound up burned. About a month later, I decided that, gee, I need 'em all back again and so then began the lifetime search to complete my EC collection. To buy them for the next 10, 20 years. Finally, I got 'em all back again. - [Jello] In 1969, a new threat emerged. Mike Diana was born. - [Mike] Well, I was born in upstate New York, a small town called Geneva, and my father, he was a science teacher. My mother stayed at home and took care of me and my sister. I seemed to have a happy life. I enjoyed school. I enjoyed holidays and everything. - When he was preschool, prekindergarten, and the teacher came to me and said, "Can he talk? "Because he has never said a word since he's been here." And I said, "Yes, he can speak." Well, one day the teacher asked a question and Mike said the answer, and one of the little girls in the class said, "He talked, Michael talked!" - Growing up, Mike was always special. He was well behaved, he was quiet. Never had any problem with him, never had any problem at all. Not compared to my other two. - When I was in kindergarten, we had an assignment was to draw our family portrait. So I ended up drawing my whole family nude, and I had drawn us naked with genitalia, and the teacher came over my shoulder and said, "Well, where are their clothes?" And I remember I felt ashamed and erased all the genitalia, and added clothes, but you could still see the indentations of the pencil underneath the clothing. I also had a tapeworm collection, hundreds of different types of tapeworms. I would sometimes bring these items into show and tell at school. My father didn't really believe in spanking, but he did believe in pulling hair because he was a science teacher, they weren't allowed to hit the students, but they had to harm them in ways they wouldn't leave marks, and pulling hair is one of those ways. So, my father was always pulling our hair when we were bad. I started doing drawings about people having their hair pulled out by the roots. Occasionally there was a problem with one of the neighbours. I remember one time this woman who lived next door, she was a little crazy in the head. She came out with two cupcakes with cherries on 'em and she called me and my best friend over. When we got close enough, she smashed a cupcake right in his face, and he started instantly crying, and then I ran right home. (laughing) - [Producer] Wait, what? Is there any back story to that? Why? - I don't know. (laughs) - But then when I was eight years old, our family decided to move to Florida. (energetic punk music) ♪ My daddy died ♪ ♪ He died on the phone ♪ ♪ We all knew and cried and cried ♪ ♪ He thought I was a joke ♪ ♪ They'll take his job ♪ ♪ You know what they did ♪ ♪ All I do is try and try ♪ ♪ I'm just a kid ♪ - When I did move to Florida, I never stopped drawing. Drawing was what I always liked to do. In school, it became the only subject that I really got good grades in. I started drawing monsters, spaceships, the kinda stuff I was drawing before, but it was more intense, even more radical in some way. I remember making pottery projects for my mother. She still has them today. One of the ways my mother encouraged my artwork is she took me to art museums around Florida. The Ringling Art Museum, the Dali Art Museum. We both enjoyed art together. I often wondered how my art would differ if I never moved to Florida. I feel like Florida shaped my art and put it in the direction of the extreme nature that it was in. My dad liked sideshows all the time, so we'd go to sideshows and see the freak animals, barnyard oddities. - Okay, what about human oddities though? - Those too. We had the sword swallower. Things like that would amaze me. I think at least people in the carnival here are kind of outcasts in society. - Okay, yes. - After seeing them, I felt the same way. (suspenseful music) When I was eight years old, we first moved to Florida. This was the church we started going to. I remember that it was different from the church I was used to in New York. The sermons here by the priest seemed to be full of fire and brimstone. He was telling us how we were gonna burn in Hell for our sins, unless we repented. It felt very heavy somehow. I remember one time in Bible class, the elderly teacher was talking about the crucifixion itself, the suffering that Jesus did. She went on in great description talking about his tortures. They rubbed salt in his wounds. They pulled his beard hairs out. They spit in his face. She actually started crying while she described the tortures and the horror that Jesus went through. Around this time, I also would watch news reports on television about Catholic priests molesting children, and how the church would actually cover these instances up. This was very troubling to me as a young person myself. (church organ music) When I was nine, I went to my first Confession. Father Hope handed me a small wafer and asked me to eat it, I did. He then asked me to drop my shorts and put my rear to the hole in the wall that was between us. I felt a sharp penetrating pain in my tight anus. That was the first time I saw God. It wasn't what I was expecting. That night I told my mom about my experience with God. I went and saw Father Hope every Sunday for about six months. Then one day I went to see Father Hope and the nun said he left for Canada. I saw about six other kids my age wondering why Father Hope had left. They looked like lost sheep. Now I'm 25, I still trip out with God. I drop acid hosts and shove a crucifix up my asshole. I'm a junkie sex slave for God, but at least I'll be rewarded in the afterlife. Right? One more time. This is your brain. This is a Bible. This is your brain on a Bible. (sizzling) Any questions? (bell tolling) When I was about 10 years old, I found some real life violent pictures. It was a book on child abuse that was actually in the school library, and I started seeing these images of dead children. I felt attracted to it somehow, but also nervous or afraid maybe about violence, real life violence. (ominous music) I used to love horror movies ever since I was a young child, and I went with my father and talked him into taking me to the local mom and pop video store and getting me my own video membership, so I could just ride there on my bike and pick out movies. Some of my favourite videos back then to rent, of course were the horror videos. The more bloody and crazy the better. In 1986, I actually had saved up enough money at my supermarket bag boy job to buy a video camera, a brand new video camera of my own, and my father thought it was a good idea for me to get the camera because I could go around and film family events and stuff like that. But what I ended up filming mostly was something my father would end up not approving of and that was making my own homemade gore and slasher films. (laughing) Back then, I didn't really have any of my own friends who would want to be in these films of my age, so my younger brother was kind of drafted into it. I would send my brother out to recruit his friends, which again, was kids around the neighbourhood. We would say, "You want to be in a movie?" And their eyes would light up. "Oh, in a movie?" (child screaming) We're talking about kids as young as five years old. - Oh, that was fun. That was fun making those videos Having my friends from school and trying to get them to be in the videos was pretty fun and having their parents let them, the ones that knew about it anyway. (laughs) - Mike suggested that I be in one of his movies, and I said, "Sure, why not?" I think I had my head cut off. (dramatic music) (splattering) (head thuds) - Mike has always been into making movies, and I was actually in one, and I kind of wasn't sure if it was a good idea, and maybe after the fact, I wondered if it was smart that I had done it because I was religious when I was younger. I would go to church a lot, and for this particular film, he was to give me an abortion. (laughs) So in the film. My stomach, I'm pregnant, my baby! Matt was hitting me and I says, "Oh, don't hit me, I'm pregnant." "I'm gonna have a baby." And Matt says, "Oh, well, I'll give you an abortion." And so here I am, laying there, and Matt has a hanger. (screaming) And then he pulls the hanger back and there's a little plastic toy foetus with fake blood all over it, and that was kind of fun. I'm glad that I did that, even though I wasn't sure. I have no regrets over it. - After watching 'em after we made 'em, and it's just, that was our home movies, you know? That's all we got to look at now. (laughs) - In real life, I detested violence. Even in school when fistfights would break out, or all the kids would gather around in a circle and would watch the fight and cheer and yell, and the whole of energy of that kind of scared me. I remember always walking the other way, but horror movies I liked, because it had a lot of fake blood and I knew it was fake, and it seemed to me, it was fun. I realised it was much easier to make comics than it was to make movies. I didn't need anyone else's help. I didn't need anyone else to approve anything. I didn't need any parents' permissions. - Look at Phoebe. - Phoebe, come here! (laughing) - Eventually, I discovered "Heavy Metal" illustrated. I got this at the supermarket newsstand. These were unlike any comics I had seen before. There was nudity, violence. I found an ad in one of the "Heavy Metal" magazines and it said you could buy an underground comic grab bag. I had never heard of underground comics before that. Soon in the mail, I got a plain brown package of underground comics. The first one I pulled out of the envelope was "Bizarre Sex." It had a giant penis on the cover breaking through the sidewalk on a city street, people screaming, running away from it. This did seem very exciting to me. Also "Skull Comics" and "Zap Comix" were some of the titles. - So, underground comics were part of this counterculture movement and they were very subversive, explicit publications. I really feel the whole point of underground comics was to break taboos. I mean, that's why they were made. They were all about pushing boundaries, and why that was so important is because they showed us that nothing was off limits. That we had complete artistic freedom, and I think by the time Mike Diana was creating "Boiled Angel," that's what he believed. (people screaming) (gunshots firing) - I was drawing when I was like, three years old. I did some funny animal book with an animal on the right hand side, and an animal on the left hand side, and poetry about that animal on the right hand side like, "Here's Edgar the Elephant. "He thinks he's a smell-ephant." I didn't know there was not a word smell-ephant. Well, in high school I started to do fanzines, and when we went to college and we did college magazines, then we worked for the realist and free press type publications, and then the underground press came, and then we did underground comics. We wanted to speak to our peers and our peers were not reading the comic books that were approved by the good comics code at the time. So, we just ignored it and did what we wanted to do and printed our own books. So, when we did our comics, we defied the code. We ignored the code, and today, I'm happy to say the code is dead. (laughs) - So, these were very explicit publications. You're not gonna find them in a drug store. You're not gonna find them next to Archie comics. Where they were primarily sold is head shops next to drug paraphernalia. So, there was this outlaw aspect to these publications. That's why they were spelled with an X at the end. The X suggested an X rating. - So-called pornographic underground comics like "Snatch" and "Felch" weren't really pornography in the traditional sense. It was more like a satire of pornography, because the audience were hippies, you know? And they already, they didn't have those repressions about performing such sexual acts themselves, so it was kinda like mocking those who did, you know? "Snath," or "Felch," or "Jiz" comics came out and it was kind of, I even did one called, "Turned on Cuties." And I used a fake name, just for kicks. Everybody knew it was me, but. - Underground comics weren't completely immune from attacks of obscenity. Usually the way it worked was when there was obscenity charges, they would go after the bookstores and the booksellers, and this bookstore, East Side Books in New York was busted basically. One of the kids at the cash register, there was charges brought against him, and it was for this comic, "Zap" number four and specifically for this story, Joe Blow, which is pretty infamous in comics. It's a comic by R. Crumb and it's about a family that at first glance looks like this squeaky clean family but we get a couple pages in and we learn they have a very incestuous relationship amongst themselves. It really was pushing all of the boundaries, very explicit. As you might imagine, it did attract attention, and they did not successfully fight those charges. They had to pay a fine. - Comics was really about bonding with my dad in a way because he was a salesman, and he sold cigarettes and he sold candy, and he would work most of the day and come home at night, and he'd have one comic book that he'd give me, and you know, I just was sitting there waiting for it. Sometimes I remember the horror, every now and then he would have bought me one that he had already bought me before, and I was like, "Oh my god, I already have this." But normally, it was this really exciting thing, and it was like this, "Dad's coming home and I get a comic book." When I was in grade school, I would get a Big Chief tablet and just draw my own comics, you know? I didn't do word balloons, because I wanted to draw them as quickly as possible, so I would just say the dialogue aloud like, "Stop it, I'm gonna blast you with my laser." Whatever, and then draw it as quickly as I could, and then turn the page and again, it was sort of like this feeling of incredible, like an addict looking for their next fix. By some miracle, I ended up going into the Master's programme at Yale, so I have like a BFA from Yale University. Yeah, over time I sort of came to my senses and went back to doing comics, and a big part of that was sort of discovering the zine world of the late '80s. - These zines were self-published by amateurs, and they were printed in small numbers using mimeograph machines or later in the '70s, photocopy machines. They were traded in the mail. These weren't publications you would find on the newsstands. There was the zine community that was dedicated to science fiction. There was a zine community that was into horror comics, and then there was the zine community that was into poetry, or bicycle repair, or all these different categories, and these different communities really didn't connect or talk to each other. They were very separate, and one thing that changed that was a publication called "Factsheet Five," and basically "Factsheet Five" was like a catalogue of almost all the zines that were being created at the time. - I was like, how can I see all of these? You know, I'd buy "Factsheet Five," where there was this 100 pages of all these zines listed, and I'd get that and I'd get home and I'd start going down there and I was like, "I'd like to see that one and that one." But even though they were cheap, there still wasn't, I wasn't making any money, so it wasn't like I could afford to buy all of them. So I thought, I had this friend Steve Serios. We got the idea to curate a show of zines, and then the zine people would send us the zines. So in 1989, we just started getting boxes and boxes of zines coming to us. There was this extreme quality to a lot of the zines. They were just like, pushing the envelope in every direction you can think of, and yet there was this one zine (laughs) that just stood out from all the others. I think the zines were called "Angelfuck." You know, which is kind of in your face, and it was Mike Diana. - The title "Angelfuck" I got from a song by the band Misfits, and I thought it would make a good zine title. Even my first comics had a dark side to them, macabre side. I seemed to like drawing comics that I had not seen before. I liked to draw mutilation, nudity, murder. Things that most people felt were unsavoury were the subject I liked the most. I felt like there's a lot of humour in my comics, not everyone finds the humour in it. I thought they were funny. - [Woman] It's not funny. I'm not laughing, Mike. Look at me, I'm not laughing. This is dead serious stuff here. - It was just like, wow, everyone else is trying to offend, but this one is so fucking offending. I mean, I can't, you know, it's like I want to hide it and only see it in a dirty bathroom on 42nd Street, and it was just amazing to see someone who, you know, it's like, "Oh, you really have pushed the envelope." I'm sorry, envelope pushing winner right here. - And then in 1989, I did "Boiled Angel." ♪ Gonna save you, save you ♪ ♪ What do I do ♪ ♪ I'm gonna do you, do you ♪ ♪ And if you sit beside me ♪ ♪ Then you don't want to get up ♪ ♪ When I wanna talk ♪ ♪ I'll talk I love you, love you ♪ ♪ When I wanna walk, I walk ♪ ♪ I love you, love you ♪ ♪ And if I had to try to keep you screaming I will ♪ ♪ What I wanna do ♪ ♪ What I wanna do ♪ ♪ I wanna strangle you tonight, tonight ♪ - [Mike] I felt like this was the year 1988 and things should be a step above the underground comics that I had seen in the past, that this was the future. - I mean, there's a part of it that's just like, look at me. It's like, I'm putting out a zine, 25 people are gonna see it, but by pushing the material to the nth degree, it's like it's sort of almost like compensating for it. It's like, you push and you push against a certain thing, and I think what you're pushing against ultimately is this kind of bland, suburban middle class world, and that's what punk music is. - My goal was to make the most offensive zine ever made, and it should be offensive as possible, almost to the point where your average person would not want anything to do with it, wouldn't even want to own a copy of it. (explosion rumbles) - [Jello] The state of Florida was not amused. - At the time, I was the lead trial attorney of Division E of the State Attorney's office at the sixth judicial circuit of Florida, which sits in Clearwater, Florida. What ended up happening was that the "Boiled Angel" volumes that preceded or I believe it was "Boiled Angel" number six, fell into the hands of some law enforcement, who then sent it to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement saying, "You might want to look into this." This was during the summer of 1990, I guess it was or '91. When at the time, the student murders were occurring at the University of Florida in Gainesville. - [Reporter] Five college students, four women and one man were found dead in their Gainesville apartments. Two of the victims were reportedly mutilated, their bodies left on display. Another was beheaded. - A law enforcement officer who came across "Boiled Angel" number six in the course of a traffic stop that resulted in an arrest for something like possession of marijuana, he flipped through it and he saw something that looked to him strikingly similar to what had gone out on the law enforcement wire as being the appearance of some of the murder scenes. It was an officer I believe, with the California Highway Patrol had sent it to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and they look at it and sure enough, this stuff comes from Largo, Florida. Somebody in the same state, so let's take a look. - One day Mike and I were in my front yard, and a police car drove up and two officers got out, a male and a female. They said they came to ask Mike some questions, and it had to do with the Gainesville serial murders. They asked if they could get some blood taken, and Mike said no at first, but I said, I said yes. Yeah, if you're innocent, then you will have your blood taken. Who cares, you know? At least it'll shut them up for a minute. - I was not the Gainesville serial killer. - They ended up taking body samples from Michael Diana, eliminated him as a suspect, but in the course of investigating some of the most gruesome murders in Florida, they were still so shocked by what they saw in the material itself that they decided we shouldn't just let it go with that and they handed it off to the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office, which then undertook an investigation for obscenity. - Michael Diana has been cleared of any involvement in the Gainesville murders, but his visions of sex and masochism, and child abuse, well, they seem to be getting him in trouble. - I know that the case had been sitting in going through the works inside the state attorney's office. Folks kinda wondering what to do with it, because everybody knew that something should be done, but wasn't exactly sure how to go about it. I was young and relatively fresh from law school and had taken First Amendment as a class, and remembered very clearly all the law that applied in the case, and was interested in going forward with it and had a good idea for how to go about it, so the case was assigned to me. - I went on the publish "Boiled Angel" seven and eight. (ominous music) Unknown to me at the time, one of the detectives that went after me for the Gainesville student murders bought them from me under a fake name. - An undercover detective, his name was Mike Tessas, he struck up a correspondence relationship with Mike Diana, and ended up ordering "Boiled Angel" seven and "Boiled Angel" eight. - [Undercover Detective] "Mike, I'm tired of people "fucking around with what I believe in. "I saw your "Boiled Angel" at a friend's "and it's everything I think of and believe. "Please send me a copy of "Boiled Angel" "and other flyers you can. "It's hard to find things to read "because of people fucking with us. "Here's a three dollar money order "like the copy said to cover cost. "Thanks, Mike Fiore." - So, we told him we can't build a case on "Boiled Angel" number six because that was something that was discovered out in California. We don't know if this thing was published from Pinellas County, Florida. It said inside Largo, Florida, but we didn't know for sure. We didn't have anybody to say, "Yes, I ordered it. "I received it in Florida." We told him, you've got to start from scratch with this, and if you order and receive them here in Pinellas County, we're good to go. - [Mike] "Dear Mike F. "You are the first person from Largo "to ask for Boiled Angel, so I hope you find it to be cool. "Let me know what you think of them. "Sincerely, Mike Diana." - It wasn't entrapment because entrapment only applies if the person allegedly entrapped is not predisposed to commit the offence. The fact that this was something that Mike Diana had gone into and published on his own, and was already into volume number seven and then volume number eight shows he was predisposed. He just didn't know that the guy he was selling to was somebody other than he held himself out to be. We were unpleasantly surprised that they exceeded "Boiled Angel" six. You know, seven was worse than six, and then eight was worse than seven. (disorienting music) - [Woman] Well, Mr. Donner, everything checks out okay. We'll send Scott out right now! - [Scott] Wow, is it really true? I've been adopted! - Yes, it's true my new son. - [Woman] Here's your copies of the papers, sir. - [Scott] Boy, I finally got adopted! Someone to love me and to hold and-- - [Father] Shut the fuckin' hell up, you fuck! I only adopted you to use you as my slave! (dramatic music) You didn't think I adopted you outta love, did you? How could I even think of loving a fuckin' misfit orphan like you? The only thing I'm gonna love is fucking your hot little ass! - [Scott] Sob, sob. - [Father] This is your room. You will sleep here. Now, get undressed and bend over! - [Scott] Sob, sob. Please don't! - Shut up, dumb fuck! - Throb, throb. (groaning) (splattering) - [Scott] Ah, oh, sob, sob! - [Narrator] Next morning, Scott woke with a sore asshole. He was forced to eat dog food for breakfast. - Eat it, ugly! - Blah. - [Father] This is my dog food factory. Watch and learn! - Yes sir. - Ga ga, goo, goo. - First I take one of these infants the whores downtown sold me. (baby crying) Then I fuck it inside out. - Gasp! - Whaak, splork. (splattering) - [Father] See, I fucked it inside out, and I really shot a big wad also! Then I toss the messy remains in the infant shredder. It goes through the grinders. (metallic grinding) And then it's canned as dog food so I can sell 'em to the A&P store. Your job is to make sure the cans go into the boxes, understand, fuck? - [Scott] Yes, sir! - [Father] This is Max, my watch dog. Be careful, he bites. (dog growling) Now I gotta get to work. (baby crying) (sloshing) Uh, climax! That was a good one. (grinding) (splattering) - [Narrator] Over the next work week, Scott made a good friend in Spot. - [Scott] I wanna be friends. See, I got you a big juicy steak! My new dad is a very sick and evil man. We are both his slaves. Will you help me kill him, please? No one loves me! Will you please be my best friend? Will you love me? Sob, sob, sob. (dog whining) I'll set you free. (metallic squeaking) - [Father] What the fuck? Put that chain back on that dog! (dog growling) - Kill him! - Shit! Gasp! (splattering) (groaning) - [Scott] I'm so happy now. He is finally dead and lifeless. It's just you and me now, Spot. I love you so very much. Do you love me, Spot? No, not you too, Spot! Sob, sob, sob. (dog barking) (dog howling) (dramatic music) - I got a look at it and I knew right away that what I was looking at was obscenity. - [Reporter] Prosecutor Stuart Baggish says Michael Diana's art violates community standards. - I've seen gross stuff before, and it's not made me want to lose my lunch or anything, but this stuff when I saw it the first time, I just thought, this is vile. It felt like a punch in the gut. You know, that may have been his purpose in publishing the material. He certainly wanted to get people's attention for no reason other than shock, the question is, was he doing it in a way that actually constitutes speech or was it obscenity? - It's worthy of prosecution. - [Interviewer] And jail time and everything, huh? - That's what we're shooting for and we think that this publication requires that type of penalty. I look at it as obscene from the minute I opened it up. It was in our office, it had not been prosecuted yet. When I looked at it, there was no question in my mind that it was obscene, I was repulsed by it. There was even spending more time with it, I found nothing redeeming about it. I only found it more and more repulsive. (ominous music) - [Mike] I got a summons in the mail charging me with three counts of obscenity. Publishing, distributing, and advertising obscene material. (crunching) (slurping) - I teach at the Centre for Cartoon Studies. I've been there since we opened our doors. A class that is called "Survey of the Drawn Story," because in academia, you can't call it "Comics History Class." The Mike Diana case history is incredibly important to the history of comics. It's important on a number of levels. It's important as a real benchmark of the legal backlash against the growing freedom of expression that was happening across the board in comics from the mid '80s to, well, where we are today. Another thing that happened as part of that continuity is another 18 year old cartoonist named Mark Laliberte, he was doing a zine as well, very small circulation zine, and he got popped by the Canadian police. Mounties showed up at his door, crashed into the house, confiscated material, and there was a strip that Mark had done in his zine. It was a parody of Peanuts, but it had a panel where Snoopy was sodomising Sally, Charlie Brown's little sister, right? And the Canadian legal authorities not only go after Mark Laliberte on obscenity charges, they bring him up on bestiality charges, okay? This is what they go into the courtroom with. - There was a kind of, I'm trying to think of the exact name. I think it was Project Pornography or something like that, and there was this kind of group of police that were sort of moved from kind of like the drug squads to dealing with obscenity in Canada for this short period. And so they really actually had no sort of sense of what would be considered truly obscene. It was all guesswork. - I was friends with a Canadian retailer and comics creator named Mark Asquith. Mark was one of the experts brought into the courtroom in this trial, and Mark Asquith was incredibly smart on the stand. Mark broke down for the judge and for the court, that the only act that had taken place was that an 18 year old boy was sitting down at a desk with a pencil and a piece of paper making marks on paper. That was the only physical act that had ever taken place to create this two page strip. No human being was sodomised. (laughs) No dog had sodomised a human being, and the judge threw it out, because it just didn't meet any standard, and had nothing to do with the charges that Mark Laliberte had been busted for. This becomes important because Mark himself told me that he and Mike Diana had traded zines in the mail. "Boiled Angel" had gone from Florida up to Canada, and Mark's zine had gone from Canada down to Florida. - The officers who were trying my case really hated Mike's work and really hated that zine, and really hated his presence in my publication, and tried to focus actually a lot of my obscenity trial on the fact that I was a publisher of his work. The officer was quite angry, I think, when he lost the case here. - When the Canadian authorities had the case thrown out in their prosecution of Mark Laliberte, apparently a call was made from Canada to Florida, and it was like, "We didn't get our guy, "but (laughs) we have this copy of Boiled Angel." You know, and this according to two accounts I've heard, was what led to the prosecuting amping up, prosecution amping up. They're going after Mike Diana. I have to say, it was always suspect to me that a zine, you know, Mike Diana printed, I think like 60 copies of "Boiled Angel" number one, and the highest circulation he had was between 200 and 300 copies. That's a little drop of piss in all the oceans of the world, and that the police would happen to come across this zine just is complete fantasy to me. It made perfect cause and effect sense to me when Mark Laliberte told me his story. I mean, my understanding is at some point they went, "Oh, he's not the killer." He's not the Gainesville killer, why go back after him? And this whole thing with Mark's zine being busted, going to trial, and the trial failing and then within weeks, everything starts heating up for Mike Diana. Boy, I mean, it seems very credible to me. - A one time suspect in the Gainesville murders faces obscenity charges in Pinellas County tonight. This all involves a comic book. - I didn't realise how serious it was until I got to the courthouse and saw the newspaper and TV reporters and protest groups against me. Even worse, I was facing three years in prison. - [Evan] Michael Diana emerged from a Pinellas County courtroom this afternoon prepared as he says, to fight the state of Florida. The 23 year old could face two years in prison. - First of all, there are three types of pleas. - [Evan] He was arraigned today on three charges of publishing, and advertising obscene material. It's called "Boiled Angel." - How to kill our children and put 'em in barbecue sauce. Showing these books out on people murdering our infants and children. - So, where do you draw the line on what's obscene and what's not? It normally depends on community standards, and the Mike Diana case may have Pinellas County reevaluating its standards right here in the next couple months. Well, in the newsroom, we were talking about it at the time, and I remember wondering how someone could be prosecuted for their art, for their beliefs, for their comics. In the news business, you get a call or you get a tip from the community about a story like this and it goes through the assignment desk. I got assigned the story and out the door to meet Michael Diana and see what this was all about. I thought it was kind of odd to see that one woman in my story, her eyes would well with tears in the second before she would talk to me, and then when we were done, she'd go back to doing what she was doing. That happens with a lot of stories in the news business. When the camera comes on, the drama begins. I was struck by the severity of the events surrounding him a little bit, and I remember picking up a book containing these drawings of his, and I'm looking through them and of course they were gross. They were odd, but they were cartoons. They didn't really upset me. I kinda chuckled and wondered at the time, is this what this is all about? Judge Mary Jean McAllister set a pretrial date for June 7th. Diana says he doesn't have an attorney yet, but he does say that he has contacted the Comic Book Legal Defence Fund and they may represent him, but we were not able to confirm that. (alarm blaring) (dog barking) - I was going to art school in the 1970s in New York City, and while I was there, I went to a record store, and they had a spin rack that was all underground comics. When I saw that, that was when I knew I wanted to be a cartoonist, and that I wanted to be an underground cartoonist. I also mistakenly thought those guys were all millionaires. I found out the hard way that that was not the case. Throughout the 1980s, there was as comics are becoming more popular again, and with the rise of undergrounds morphing into alternative comics, comics were no longer clearly about just being for kids, which a lot of people in the country had a really hard time getting their head around, so when they'd see a comic book that had adult content in it, they just assumed that somebody was trying to subvert their children. At that time, there was something that was really dominating the news and reached the point of hysteria was child sexual abuse, and his comics touched into that, so it was bad timing that his comics were dealing somewhat, not entirely of course, but somewhat with sex with underaged people. (trippy synth music) There was a lot of controversy about his work amongst artists just because a lot of people thought it was bad. You know, a lot of people in the comic book industry just thought this guy can't draw or they saw no beauty in the way he drew. They saw no artistic value in it, and also a lot of people in the comic industry were just as offended as everybody else by the content of it. So even though he was in very serious trouble, and his First Amendment rights were clearly being violated, or a government agency was attempting to violate his First Amendment rights, it was still a bit of a controversy in the industry as to whether we should use our resources through the Comic Defence Fund to help this guy. So, I was a little bit taken aback by some people in the industry who didn't think that money should be spent to help this guy out. They just figured, just let him hang, you know? And it's to their eternal disgrace. - [Mike] The Comic Book Legal Defence Fund hired Luke Lirot as my defence attorney. - When I first saw Mr. Diana's work, I was personally troubled by it. I found it somewhat unsettling. - [Kathy] Sure. - But to me, it posed a much greater issues because it's not just his comic book that we're talking about. We're talking about the entire gamut of First Amendment rights, and if you cannot be secure in protecting his imagery, no matter how offensive it may be, then you can have no security that any ideas will be protected. I actually went to Catholic school in the early '60s, and we were given an assignment to create a collage. My parents were divorced. My mother worked in a dress shop, and to create this collage that was given to me as a homework assignment, the only magazines I had access to were fashion magazines, women's magazines, and they had women in bras and legs sticking out of bathtubs and I think it was Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Women's Wear Daily, and when handing it to the nun, she was so shocked about the content of my work. She tore it up right in front of me, which was an absolute shock to me. I thought she'd be impressed at how much time and effort I put into it, and I got expelled after that. I got kicked out of second grade because I essentially had turned in something that a person in authority found to be unacceptable. So, if there's a defining point in my life that has made me a big fan, and basically what I consider to be a valiant patriot in the service of the First Amendment, I think I can track that back to second grade. - 20 years ago, this used to be the courthouse. I don't know what it is today. In a way, I was like an instant celebrity. People had seen me on the news. They came up to me and they would say, "Oh, so they let you out? "Even though you killed those people." They were talking about seeing footage and images of the Gainesville student murders, the bodies being actually led out of the dorms with white sheets over them, interspliced with footage talking about me and my "Boiled Angel" fanzine. But then there was the other side of the coin, the religious fanatic people that would approach me. I would be just pumping gas into my car at a gas station, and there'd be a few religious people would recognise me, and come over and start praying for me, giving me religious pamphlets, telling me to change my ways. This was very unpleasant sometimes. What is this, police? - I don't know, bro. - Detectives. - [Producer] Are you scared of the police? - Hmm? - Are you scared of the police? - Oh yeah. - Why, what reason? - They'll rape you with a nightstick. - Eyewitness News reporter Steve Nichols joins us from our St. Petersburg newsroom with the very latest twist in what's known as the "Boiled Angels" case, Steve? - Kelly, as that very name suggests, this is not a mainstream magazine. Its publisher says he only prints about 300 copies of each issue but if he had any doubts, Michael Diana now knows for sure his tiny mag will attract all kinds of forces, and not all of them friendly. Outside the courtroom, one protestor in Diana's corner. - I'm here today because I believe in America, and I believe in the Constitution, and I believe in the First Amendment. - [Reporter] But there were far more protestors against the defendant, including one offering forgiveness. - But we are concerned for you as a person, and I know, I know you need a heart and mind renewed. - [Reporter] And outside the courthouse, a sample of the debate to come. - He can't be tied up! - Brutalization and victimisation of children. - Should these hands be tied? I think not. - Citizens Opposing Pornography and Concerned Women of America, promised to keep the pressure on prosecutors and judges in the "Boiled Angels" case. - By his looks here, Diana is just cluing in to what lays ahead. - I strongly associated with national and local organisations, the particular one was Concerned Women for America. That's how I found out about the Michael Diana case. My heart was particularly touched by somebody this young drawing such graphic material. What I felt was under the guise of the First Amendment, because the First Amendment was meant to redress issues of religious and political problems and ideas on both sides of the fence, not obscenity. So, my heart kind of went out to this young man. I did not read all of his book, but I saw enough of the graphic material, and what disturbed me the most was the fact that it used children. Michael Diana, have you been sexually abused as a child? - No, and it isn't any of your business anyways. - You're lying, Michael. Even though Michael said to me he wasn't, he prefaced it with he wasn't, and then said, "But it's none of your business anyway." Which seemed to shout to me loud and clear, there is a lot of pain in his life. Where is your pain coming from then, Michael, if it wasn't sexual abuse? Why all this prolific, graphic, psychopathic sexual distortion of what should be beautiful? So, am I saying he lied? I'm saying there's a very good possibility because of shame, people hide it in different ways, and they don't always want to admit it. - Was there something in your life, maybe I'm looking a little too deep into this, but just let me ask the question. Because sometimes art helps us work out some very big nightmares in our lives. Is there anything that happened in your life that's inspired your art? - Well, I was never abused. I had a pretty good childhood. I had been taking art classes ever since I could remember, and I just want to draw what I want to draw. (suspenseful music) (snoring) (bottle shatters) - [Father] Wake up, you ugly piece of dog shit! I told you to have my breakfast cooked for me before I got up! The way you disobey me, you must like this clothes hanger. And don't come back till you catch me a rabbit for my lunch! - [Stan] Sob, sob! Hi, little grasshopper. Will you be my friend? My father is so mean to me! He's a hardcore alcoholic and he sexually assaults me every night. He puts his lit cigarettes out on my arms! I wish I could just live here in these woods the rest of my little life. (birds chirping) You almost look like you understand me! - [Grasshopper] It does understand you, Stan. - [Stan] What the hell? Who are you? You know my name? - [Grasshopper] The grasshoppers told me about you, Stan. I come from a far faraway, exotic land. Can you dig it? (rubber band springing) I came to help you, Stan, to set you free! Your dad fucks you up your little hot, young, tight ass, doesn't he, Stan, huh? - [Stan] Yes, he does all the time! - Don't cry, take my hand, pal. (rumbling) (birds chirping) - [Stan] This is so cool! We're flying so high! How do you do it? - [Grasshopper] I can make you into a grasshopper, Stan. Only you have to pass one little test for me. - [Stan] It's my house! Why are we here? Dad? - [Father] Where the hell ya been? I don't see my lunch! Time to pull out the clothes hanger. (crunching) (groaning) Son, my arm. (groaning) - [Stan] Mm, you taste good, daddy! - [Grasshopper] How did you do? - [Stan] I ate him just like a grasshopper eats a juicy leaf. - [Grasshopper] You must now take off your pants, Stan. (spring boings) Now I strip some flesh off your legs. And off your cigarette scarred arms also. Then stick a couple clothes hangers into your head to be real working antennas. (Stan groaning) And finally we cram this piece of sheet metal into your back as a wing. I must now leave you, Stan. Fly and be happy and free. - [Stan] Goodbye, friend, and thank you. I fly in the cool breeze of the night sky. Now I am truly happy and satisfied with myself. I fly over small towns and listen for the cries of little abused children. I swoop down and eat their parents like fresh green leaves. I am and always will be the grasshopper boy. (wind howling) - When he got charged with obscenities, all this stuff was done without my knowledge. I had bought a little convenience store down in Florida, and there was a luncheonette next door, and I'd go over to the luncheonette and I took the St. Petersburg Times, that's a big newspaper in the county. Right on the front page in the centre section, I started reading and it said, "Michael Diana, "Gainesville murder suspect being charged with obscenities." And I didn't know what I was reading. I started to get dizzy and my head was spinning. What is this? And I tell you, it just devastated me. Now, I love Mike and I've always loved him, and I support him, I just didn't like some of these drawings myself, but to want to put somebody in jail for three years for drawing pictures is crazy. (ominous music) (owl hooting) - When I discovered the world of comics, the world of people who made comics, it was about 1983. I was a 22 year old journalist, and I'd read and loved underground comics as a kid, as a teenager, so I was very, I was very buoyed up. I was excited, I was thrilled to come to America where they had this First Amendment where things, this material was actually produced where it seemed like artists could create art without risking customs' wrath, without risking police wrath, without sending people to prison. A chief of police who walked into a comic shop in Jacksonville, Florida pointed to a sequence in "Death: The High Cost of Living," where we had a six page public service announcement comic in which a character puts a condom on a banana while explaining how not to get AIDS, and said, "If this is still on your shelves a week from now, "I'm shutting you down forever." And because there was a Comic Book Legal Defence Fund, because they had a fantastic attorney, Burton Joseph, who could fire off a letter to the Jacksonville Police Department explaining the concept of the First Amendment, it went away. I remember I was at the, I think it was the launch of the Cartoon Art Museum in Boca Raton, somewhere in the early '90s, and Mike's case was already happening. He hadn't yet gone to trial. I remember meeting some rich important people in the Florida comics business. These were, I think they were the wives of eminent cartoonists and such, and talking with upset and outrage about what had happened to Mike at that point, and being told by them that I didn't have the full picture, that really there were evil, terrible things that would all come out in the trial. But it was obvious that they had been sold a line, and had bought that line completely, that Mike, this was just, the obscenity charges were merely the noxious froth on the top of evil sewage that went down a long way and that there were bodies. If you reached down, you would come up with rotting body parts and dirt. - [Woman] He put on a tie himself. - Excuse me, ma'am, would you like some cake? - [Woman] No. - What we're doing here is we're, uh-- - They portrayed children being molested and in sexual activity. - It's a First Amendment case. - They show young children being raped. - [Man] Yeah, I had to hold back the lawyers. - Did he tell you? (people chattering) - The day of the court date, I had my own video camera, and I took it to the courthouse and they told me not to turn it on, but I had it on anyway, and I had it on the entire time through the metal detector, and I had it to the courthouse, and I was videotaping everybody. I was interviewing a few people there. One lady was pretty crazy, telling me Mike is damned for good, and I'm sure that's on video somewhere. - All I can feel is compassion for him because he's deceived. He's deceived, Hell is real. Hell is real. Hell is real, you're serving Satan, and he'll kill you. He'll take you to Hell eternally. - I got to sit in on the jury selection with my lawyer. There were two younger people in the group of 30, which said, "It's okay for art to be shocking." They were struck my the prosecution immediately. - Was this a jury of your peers? Was anybody under 35 on the jury? - No. - You knew you were in trouble when they all had swastikas on their shirts. - Yeah. - And they all had rednecks, right? - Yep. - Had they ever read a book? - Well, one of the old ladies in the jury said her only contact with pornography was a copy of Playboy she found in her grandson's underwear drawer. - Isn't that pathetic? You're lucky, they were gonna lynch you. If you were black, they would've hung you up. - [Jello] Although "Boiled Angel" printed the works of numerous artists and writers, it was Mike Diana as publisher and Diana's art in particular that became the focus of the trial. - This isn't the usual charge that the DA's office or in Florida, the State Attorney's office typically brings, and because it typically evokes strong public reaction. You know, this is America. We don't have censorship here. What are you trying to do? So, we wanted to make sure that in fact, all of our ducks were in a row, that all of the elements of obscenity were gonna be provable and the standard for gauging whether in fact something is obscene is really a very, very difficult standard to meet. It's established by the US Supreme Court in the case of Miller versus California, and it's a three part test. You know, the first one of course is that you have to prove that it is patently offensive according to contemporary community standards. Pinellas County does not have to accept what is acceptable, in the bath houses of San Francisco, and the crack alleys in New York. - In this instance, Mike had made it clear that his zine was only being distributed to various individuals that shared the same avant garde, very creative, very cutting edge artistic views, and it wasn't for sale at any bookstand. It wasn't available to children. The only people that were ever forced to view it were the jurors. They were the first people that had this shoved down their throat by the state when the very first thing they did in their opening argument was hand out these zines to the people sitting on the jury just to shock them. (woman screams) That's almost like saying, "Hey, come on into my house for a sandwich," and walking into the dining room and somebody's having an appendectomy on your dining room table. - The second element of the Miller Standard is that it has to appeal primarily to a prurient interest in sex. Now, prurient is not a word that we use in our everyday conversation, it means a shameful, lustful, or morbid interest in sex. Something that's gonna make you ashamed. - None of it appealed to a prurient interest in sex. There's nothing sexual about it. It does have sexual themes, but it's not there to scintillate or appeal to the prurient interest. It's there quite honestly, to be shocking and confrontational. - The third element of the Miller Test is that it has to lack any and all serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value. What that's there to do is to ensure that we don't have a knee jerk response to stuff, and start calling things obscene that truly aren't, just because we missed the point. - So, he wanted to make sure that there was nothing artistic about it, and he went to great lengths bringing experts into the trial to say, "Well, this isn't life affirming," or "This isn't the Grapes of Wrath." Obviously, it has no artistic value, therefore, it's obscene, and I think that that was one of the real issues that we were trying to fight is that there is no good taste exception to the First Amendment. There's no bad taste exception to the First Amendment. It's just one of those things that if it doesn't work all the way for all forms of expression, it's really absolutely meaningless. - Really, if you satisfy all of the elements of Miller, you're not talking about what is actually speech. You're talking about an act that takes the form of pictures and words, but it is patently offensive. It appeals to a prurient interest in sex, which is a shameful, lustful, morbid interest in sex, and it lacks any and all serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value, and Mike Diana had the unfortunate circumstance of having satisfied all of the standards, which is unusual. (surf punk music) - The Comic Book Legal Defence Fund asked me if I would be a defence witness for the trial of Mike in 1994, and I was sent a package of "Boiled Angel," and I opened it up and I was fairly disturbed, and semi-horrified and nauseated. You know, as I was going through this is was like, "Wow, I don't know exactly if I can defend all this," because it was just so extreme. Then literally, the phone rang, and it was Chris Malone and Stuart Baggish, who were the prosecutors, and they said, "We're calling you to take your deposition." (high-pitched babbling) When they started asking me questions, I was so offended by their line of questioning, because they were basically saying that this wasn't art, and that wasn't a question in my mind at all. Of course it was art, it was just a matter of not being sort of my taste. So, as soon as they started talking about those things and questioning whether it was art and throwing out what was obscene and what wasn't, I found myself defending the work quite easily, and then I was like, "I'll see you in Florida!" (laughs) Slam. I think that might've been my first time in Florida, actually, and I went back to my hotel room and I turned on the TV, and I felt like I was in a little Mike Diana comic. There was a serial killer that they had just caught named Danny Rollings, so every station had all this gruesome detail about all of, you know, one station's got Oprah with people talking about rape and incest, and then there's the news on another station where there's some priest who's molesting some child. It gave me more ammo in terms of, gee, is it possible that Mike is responding to the environment that we live in, per chance? And he's doing that through art and comics? (ominous music) I met Mike Diana for the first time when I was down on the trial, and he just had almost nothing to say. You know, he was just like a very shy, quiet guy, and then the hilarious part was that he had this extremely attractive girlfriend, and she was like the energy behind Mike in that moment. She was like, "You have the wrong person on trial. "I'm the deviant here." - Nothing. - Mike Diana is God. - What we could do-- - Mm, mm, yeah. (moaning) I was reading a "Creative Loafing" magazine that was like the local magazine around back then, and I saw an article about Mike saying that he had gotten into trouble with his artwork, and there was a picture of him, and he looked really sad, like scared, and I felt like he could use a friend. So, I reached out to him and I said, "Hey, come over." And that's, and then we hit it off. (laughs) The first time when Mike came to my house, my dad pulled me aside and he said, "That's the Gainesville murderer! "I saw him on TV! "How dare you bring a murderer here!" Like, he's not a murderer. (laughs) Yeah, that made me really, really mad about how the news demonised him. (audience shouting) - Let me ask you something. Would you like to get beat up? - No, he doesn't-- - [Audience Member] Are you planning on having kids with this guy? With this clown? - With this clown? He's the nicest man I've ever known. He would never, ever-- - Yeah, I can tell by pictures how nice he is. He's demented. - You know, things like that, of course it's gonna take its toll on a relationship. - The trial was a very difficult time, very stressful. Very hard to deal with at times. I had given my lawyer my collection of underground comic books to show the jury that this kind of artwork was really nothing new. However, the judge said it was irrelevant, and wouldn't let us show it as evidence. The prosecution also had an art expert from Eckerd College, which was a Christian college. He was pointing to the blowups of "Baby Fuck Dog Food," and at one point he was saying, look at the way he drew these lines, so powerful and such emotion, and then Stuart Baggish would interrupt him and say, "But wait a second, it's not art, right?" And the art expert would say, "Oh, no, no, no, it's definitely not art." Their whole defence was based on the fact that it wasn't art and that it was art that would turn people into serial killers. It didn't seem to make much sense to me. - [Jello] In 1954, a psychologist testified that reading comics would turn children into juvenile delinquents. In 1994, a psychologist testified that reading "Boiled Angel" would turn adults into serial killers. - I mean, that was one of the big ways that the prosecutor was able to frame Mike as a threat to society was because there was this serial killer in the news, and that people were in a frenzy about like, that Mike was a serial killer in the making, that this art represented somebody who was one step away from serial killer. First you do it on paper, then you do it in reality. - I was talking about the testimony of Sidney Merin, who had testified that this stuff was designed to appeal primarily to a prurient interest in sex of members of a deviant class, which is sexual sadists, and Sidney Merin treats sexual sadists, that's what his practise consists of. He said this is the kind of thing that they start with, and then when it no longer stimulates them, they move on to printed material with photographs depicting the sort of things that were depicted in drawings in "Boiled Angel," and when that no longer excites them anymore, they become desensitised to it, and that works itself along a spectrum. I'm not saying and I didn't say at the time, but it's something that happens inevitably. It's just that when you read about somebody doing something horrible, oftentimes there's a reaction, why didn't somebody do something about it? I mean, it happened with Adam Lanza when he shot up the school in Connecticut. People are wondering, why didn't anybody do anything about this kid? What I wanted to point out to the jurors is in Mike Diana's case, somebody did something about it. We did something about it while it was still within the jurisdiction of the misdemeanour courts, and hadn't become a capital felony, you know? - I had not met Sidney Merin when other defence attorneys had referred to him as "Sid the Squid," because anyone could hire him and the theory was that he could squirt ink into the waters of the courtroom and create this murky, kind of awkward scenario that would benefit whoever it was that was paying him. I just thought his entire line of testimony should've been stricken, should've been precluded. Merin comes in there and testifies of who would look at this kind of thing and I thought, "How the hell does this guy know "who's gonna look at this material? "What could be more speculative?" Dr. Merin didn't test anyone. He didn't evaluate anyone, and he goes through this long list of adverse adjectives about people that are sociopaths and just on, and on, and on, painting this horrible picture of not only what the material represents, but who would be reading it, and even worse, what would the effect of that be in looking at Mike Diana's work? What's it gonna make somebody do? (dramatic music) The mind is much more complex than this monkey see, monkey do sales pitch that they try to make, but the state got away with it in this trial. One of the subtle and perhaps not so subtle undercurrents of this whole trial that Mike was not, Mike Diana's art wasn't on trial, he was as being some kind of psychopath, as being some kinda degenerate, and that's just ridiculous. I mean, you just can't make that up, because I'm sure none of the people that were actually in this case prosecuting this had any problem at all with Mr. Diana's work. I think that a lot of it was motivated by their own desire to perhaps become more notable or make a name for themselves, but we felt that their ambitions coupled with the judge's dislike of the material, and what we felt was judicial interference in our ability to make our case on a level playing field, it felt to us like the fix was in. When you make your closing argument, it's the most important, absolutely critical phase in any trial and what makes it important is that you get the opportunity to tie up all the ideas and persuade the jury and explain to them the important rights that are at stake. The minute I started to make progress, and I could see the jury's faces change, like lights going on over their head, and to have that flushed down the toilet by somebody saying, "Well, we took a break five minutes ago. "Let's take a break right now." - There was something that we all thought was really bizarre. When it happened, I remember looking at Chris and saying, "What the hell was that?" When Judge Fullerton just put his hands on the bench, "We're gonna take a break." I thought, "Okay, I guess we're taking a break." (laughs) I thought it was peculiar. - To take a recess in the middle of my closing argument, I felt was fatal to our defence. To this day, I'm still unhappy about it, and I often speculate what would've happened had that recess in my closing argument not been taken. (ominous music) - I thought my lawyer Luke put on an amazing defence. Our expert witnesses on our side, we really shot down the prosecution's experts, I felt like, and I really felt that I was gonna win my case. (gavel hammering) - One thing you can say about that material is it is absolutely worthless. - [Reporter] The jury agreed and took less than 90 minutes to convict Michael Diana for distributing obscenity. - And I had always thought I had the freedom to draw whatever I wanted to. There was a seventh alternate jury member who ended up not being needed. He was outside the courthouse here and he started talking to me, and he said his feelings being with the other jurors was that the serial killer slant on my trial being told by the prosecution that I may be a serial killer myself, basically, was what really turned them in the direction to convict me. (splattering) - I think before they said guilty, I kind of had a little bit of faith in the system, and I thought for sure that he wasn't gonna go to jail. I saw them take him away. I was in shock. - I was led from the courtroom, handcuffed and taken to a paddy waggon, which took me across the street to the jail. I'm happy that there's no free speech in Pinellas County. - [Reporter] Okay, will you still continue to do your form of art? - No, I'm gonna give up till I move out of the state some day. Three years from now when probation's over. - [Reporter] After his comments, Diana was then loaded into a sheriff's van for the short ride back to the county jail where he'll spend one more night. - Well, I mean, when you heard that he actually was found guilty, I mean, it was scary, and from our perspective here in New York, I think that our attitude is like, "Well, it's Florida." I mean, anything could happen. - That famous line when the prosecutor stands up and dismisses the expert witnesses who'd come in with the statement that the standards of Pensacola, Florida are not the standards at the gay bath houses of San Francisco and the crack alleys of New York City. When I heard that, I suddenly understood that, no, this is a small town case, and it's small town values, and they got him. - I was in the maximum detention for the first 48 hours in jail. After that, I moved to a less secure area, mostly with DUI repeat offenders. My lawyer came to visit me in jail. He said that the judge didn't have to put me in jail. He just wanted to make an example out of me. After four days and four nights, I was returned to the courthouse for sentencing. - I worked every day at the store, so I wasn't able to go to the five day trial. I did go the last day when people could go in, relatives could go in and talk about him to influence the sentencing. I remember I couldn't believe what they were making out of this. I left the courtroom, and there must've been a dozen reporters shoving microphones in my face. I didn't want to be on the news, on TV, so I told 'em, I said, "I'm going back to my store the Cabbage Patch, "and I've got some more "of those $1.49 Marlboro cigarettes to sell." Because I thought, if they put it on the news, I'm gonna get some free advertising. But I said it because I knew they would never put it on the news. - The prosecutor Baggish was pushing for jail time. He was telling the judge that the only way you could really be a punished man was that if I did jail time, because now the whole case and publicity had made me a famous artist. - We felt that incarcerative sentence, meaning something involving jail time was certainly appropriate given the gravity of it. - Instead, the judge sentenced me to, (gavel hammers) (birds chirping) three years probation, (gavel hammers) ordered me to pay a $3,000 fine, (gavel hammers) ordered me to pay $1,200 for my own psychiatric evaluation, (gavel hammers) ordered me to complete 1,200 hours of community service, (gavel hammers) ordered me to work 40 hours a week at a full-time job, (gavel hammers) ordered me to take and pass a journalism ethics course, (gavel hammers) ordered me to stay at least 10 feet away from anyone under the age of 18, (gavel hammers) and I was forbidden to draw anything that might be considered obscene, even for my own personal use in the privacy of my own home, (siren wailing) and I was subject to warrantless searches by the police to see that this was enforced. (siren wailing) - Not only couldn't his comics be sold, but the decision of the court or the judge was that he was not allowed to draw at all. (laughs) I think that's what it was, and that's nuts! (laughs) I mean, there's nothing, there's no defence for that. This is one step away from cut off his hands, you know? - My students gasp when they hear he wasn't allowed to draw, that at any point in time, the police could come into the home, come into Mike's room, and make sure he wasn't drawing. That's just like, "What the fuck?" (laughs) That's just crazy! That's just crazy. - And I think he even limited him in his artistic supplies. You couldn't have all kind of art supplies in your house, just crazy stuff. (birds chirping) - [Jello] Life goes on. - This case was filed in '93, tried in '94, and that's a lot of water under the bridge. I mean, the internet didn't exist when we filed this case, and certainly internet porn didn't exist when we filed this case. You know, nowadays, people are exposed to lots of things that they weren't exposed to then. That's one of the beautiful things about the Miller Standard is just because something is found obscene in 1993, '94, doesn't mean it's obscene forever, and it doesn't mean it's obscene everywhere. It just means it's obscene right here, right now, and that's really about it. - Actually absolutely no regrets. We did the right thing, we did our job, I'll say that. We did our job and then the jurors as citizens, they were charged with an obligation, and the result was what it was. - The ultimate irony was that Stuart Baggish and the law exposed more of the community to "Boiled Angel" number seven and eight than I ever could have. Until then, nobody even knew about me or "Boiled Angel." It wasn't until it was on the news, the news cameras actually took photographs of the so-called obscene artwork. - Mike is the only artist, the only American artist ever found guilty on obscenity charges. Not the only cartoonist, the only artist in American history found guilty of obscenity charges, but they had a real hard on for him. This was personal. This went beyond, you know, a local authority running for office wanting to amplify. I mean, they, you know, this was like they wanted to take this kid out, and even the very personal nature of the attack. But you know, legal authorities tend not to go after millionaires, because millionaires got money to defend themselves in court. A 17 year old, an 18 year old, easy target. What is this kid gonna do? And that to me is a real act of cowardice, and just an incredible abuse of authority and power. - Now, what the name of the local prosecutor? What's his name? - Stuart Baggish. - Tell this DA that I live in Pompano, come visit me. Bust me, you scumbag! Come and get me. What's his name, Baggish? - Baggish. - That bag of shit we call you. (laughing) Bag of shit. Name's Al Goldstein, I live in Pampano. 1500 North Ocean Boulevard, bust me. You turd! Why don't you pick on someone your own size. You small dick cocksucking turd! - When I left Florida and moved to New York, it was right in the middle of my appeal, so I basically snuck away to New York. I didn't even tell my lawyer at first that I left, because I just needed to get out of there. After I found out that I lost my appeal, they wanted me back in Florida to do probation. They actually tried to get the New York office probation office to take my case, but New York didn't seem to want to have anything to do with it. - The impression I get is that the police of New York are too busy to knock down somebody's door at four o'clock in the morning and make sure they're not drawing. - Well, the probation officer, this woman would call me up on the phone and remind me I wasn't supposed to be drawing. Of course, at that time, I was drawing every day since I wasn't in Florida. She also reminded me I was getting behind in my fine. I was about $100 behind and she ended up quitting the probation office and violated my probation before she left. So since 1998, I've been wanted by the police in Florida, and I haven't been able to go to Florida out of fear of being arrested. - I had mixed feelings about a lot of things regarding Mike Diana in particular. I kept getting this feeling that he personally had ambivalent feelings about everything that was happening to him and I could be terribly wrong, but I kept wondering, is he as outraged as his defenders? Just when I would read quotes from him, and even when I met him, there was this benign acceptance. It's almost like some part of him was like, "Well, I asked for it and I got it." You know? (laughs) - At this moment today, well, which is I'm sure just randomly chosen the day that a crew would come by to chat with me about Mike Diana, is the 60th anniversary of senate subcommittee meeting on juvenile delinquency, which happened in 1954, and this was when Bill Gaines was actually interviewed today 60 years ago about what his evil influence on children with EC Comics. But it's still the only person I know, that's ever gone to jail for doing a comic is Mike Diana, so here's to you, Mike. (chuckles) - For me, the thing that's most important right now about Mike Diana's case is nobody knows about it. The idea that in the history of America, one American artist has been found guilty of obscenity for his own work and what he was sentenced to, should be taught in every school. What happened to him was so profoundly wrong, and so profoundly representative of what can go wrong, and why the First Amendment is necessary, and what it means, that I'm just so happy that somebody's telling the story. - I was saddened to know that he still carries many of these wounds and I want to apologise to Michael if unnecessary wounds were inflicted. - They claimed he's gonna end up killing people. He's gonna be a serial killer, and here how many years later and I don't think he's killed anybody yet. - [Jello] Mike Diana has never stopped drawing. His art is still as outrageous, raw, shocking, funny, confrontational, controversial, but not obscene as it always was. The trial introduced him to legions of fans. Since 1994, he's had exhibitions in New York, Chicago, Baltimore, Miami, London, Berlin, Prague, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Toulouse, and Los Angeles. he has also published numerous anthologies of his work. - Yeah, it got him on people's radar screens, and he became a cause celebre. You know, that's unavoidable. I hope he made good use of it. ("Star Spangled Banner" guitar music) (laughing) - Oh, that's crazy. (bluesy guitar music) (heavy punk music)
