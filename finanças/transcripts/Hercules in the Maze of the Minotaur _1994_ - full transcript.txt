This is the story of a time long ago, a time of myth and legend, when the Earth was still young. The ancient gods were petty and cruel, and they played mankind for their sport, plaguing them with suffering, besieging them with terrors. For centuries, the people had nowhere to turn, no one to look to for help, until... he arrived. He was a man like no other, born of a beautiful mortal woman but fathered by Zeus, king of the gods. Hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart. But everywhere he went, he was tormented by his stepmother, Hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods. Hera's eternal obsession was to destroy Hercules, for he was the constant living reminder of Zeus' infidelity. No matter the obstacle, as long as there were people crying for help, there was one man who would never rest: Hercules! HERCULES THE LEGENDARY JOURNEYS Hercules in the Maze of the Minotaur [...] 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90. Hey, do you think we're going the right way?! Shh! I'm counting! 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99..., 100. 15 paces to the north. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6..., 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14..., 15. Nothing! We did go the wrong way. You were had. Ha! See, Danion?! And you said I was stupid trading three cows for this map. Come on! Wow! Just think. The great god Zeus was once here, in this very place! His treasure is gonna be ours now! We're going to be rich! - Rich as the gods! - Here, give me that. This is it. It's really true. It's unbelievable. Come on! - You got it? - Already... there. It's yours. This treasure is practically ours! - Wait a minute. Hold on. - Come on. No, hold on! What? We're almost there. If you we're going to build a door to keep people out, where would you put the locks? What do you mean? I think this door... was made to keep something in. Go and bring Hercules. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What is going on here? I told you two before, no fighting. - But you fight, Dad. - Yeah, all the time. No, that's different. I only fight when I have to, and I do it to keep people from getting hurt. Do you understand? No. Okay. It's like this. When... Remember when Eryx the Boxer came to town? And he'd beaten up a lot of men. Yeah. He was ready to beat up on some more. Who's next?! What about you?! Or you?! Huh? What about you? What about me? - It's about time. - It was me you wanted, you didn't have to kill all these innocent men. I had to find some way to amuse myself. You know, you hard look like the strongest man in the world. - Sorry to let you down. - It doesn't matter. Your days are over! Then let's stop talking... and start fighting. Son! You should have seen that last one coming! Put your left up and jab, jab! Come on! - Your boy? - No, no. I'm just a spectator. Come on! Pump one left! Oh, now he's got him, now he's got him! - He won't keep his left up! - Yeah. Enough games, Hercules. I agree. Let's finish this. Come on, w-watch, watch, watch. - You a fighter? - Me a fighter? No, I just, uh... I just fight with the devil sometimes! Right. Right! Oh, he's going better, huh? Yes! So now you know what I mean, don't you? Yeah. You only fight when you have to. And never... with your own brother. Now shake hands. That's better. Come on, you two. Alright, where are you? Father, where are you? Son? Right here. Oh, I've just come back from the two most wonderful weeks of my life. When was the the last time you had some fun? Me? Ah... It's been a long time. Ah, no one's... come for my help for sometime. I've... I guess..., uh, all the monsters and... giants are gone. I've... beat them all up. Yeah, yeah. Son, uh, do you, uh..., do you miss it? - Honestly? - Honestly. Yeah. I do. I... I miss it a lot. It's, uh... You know, I... promised Deianeira I'd be here to... raise the kids with her. You know me, I'm a man of my word. Absolutely. I love my kids. All right? I love Deianeira. I mean, everything is perfect, and I'm... I'm setted down. I'm a thousand years older, and I'm not... settled down. Hey, why don't you... come in and say hello to the children? No, no, I-I-I have an appointment. Uh... Is that appointment, uh, blonde? Oh, come on. Oh, by the way, look. I picked this up on the beach... at Salonia. That's a... scale from a seaserpent. Yes. Uh... Just to keep time. Then the shores of Salonia won't be as far off as you think. It's beautiful. Why you...? It's my protector, Hercules. Some protector... Hercules!!! This way. You hold on! I'll come back for you. Hercules! There's something in here! No!!! Did you kill it?! Did you kill it?! Is it dead?! Is it dead?! It's dead! We've gotta get outta here! Give me your hand! Hercules? Hercules. Hercules! Uh... Are you going to want to eat his food later? Hey, get out of here! You know..., sometimes I think you've been hit on the head one too many times. Daddy's got hit on the head too many times. You think so, huh? Eat. Oh... Getting heavy! Alright, now if you guys get in bed now... - Tell us a story, Dad. - Yeah, tell us a story! - Yeah, a story. - A story? - I don't know any stories. - Yes you do! I do? I want the one about the great lion. That's a good one. What about the time you fought the two headed giant? Ah, that's scary. I want the story when you first met Mommy. Alright, then. But first, imagine what it would be like... if one day... we had no fire. None at all, it's just gone. Because that's what was happening in your mom's town. Please, just let us come in. Our fires have dies, yours are still going. Just let us in. I said no! So be gone. Get away from here, all of you! But these people are desperate and cold! You have to let us have some of your fire! Look, we don't have to do anything of the kind. All right. Look, just let me light this, and I'll restart their fires! I told you, I can't help you. This fire is for the great goddess Hera. Oh, some great goddess! She's not lifting a finger to help this people! None of your damn gods do! You can't come in. All right. What if I pay? Exactly... what have you got in mind? I'm thinking, uh..., a hundred dinars. - Fifty dinars. - Fifty dinars? - All right, fine, then fifty dinars. - No, w-w-wait, wait. I said... You said fifty dinars! Yeah, I-I did, but I-I wasn't agreeing to, uh, to fifty dinars. Okay, fine, then thirty dinars! No, I-I didn't say thirty. I said fifty. I mean... You think of yourself as an intelligent man? Well..., I like to think so, yeah. Well, then you would think that twenty dinars would be a good deal! - No, w-w-wait, wait. - Fine, then twenty dinars it is. You drive a hard bargain. You can keep your money. These fools don't deserve a single dinar. I'll get the fire you need. Excuse me?! I thought I was doing a pretty good job here. What do you propose to do? Hera's vermin keep warm while everyone else is cold? That's not gonna work. Stop! This is sacrilege! I'm gonna light this from your fire. If that bothers you, then look the other way. What are you doing? You have to talk to these people, you need to negotiate with them. Where Hera's scum are concerned, this is negotiating. I hit them, they hit the floor, deal's done. Now if you excuse me, I'll, uh, be right back with your fire. You have defiled the sanctity of Hera's temple. I don't know who you are..., but you're not getting out of here alive. Then you're right. You don't know who I am. Kill him! What are you waiting for?! He angered the gods. Oops. All of you! Kill him! Here you go. No trouble at all. And that was only the beginning of it. So from there your mother and I travelled together. We went to see Prometheus and... so. - Hi. - Hi. I guess all the thrills were too much for them. I enjoyed it. - Yeah? - Yeah. Come on. Let's go to bed. Okay. - You miss it, don't you? - Hmm. Miss what? All the travelling around and fighting beasts... I saw the way you were telling the kids that story. It doesn't mean I'm not happy here. And you know that. I know that. It's just... for some reason I can't help thinking about all the journeys I went on... and all the things I've fought for. I guess I... get a little lost in it. Oh, you have a lot to get lost in. You've had so many adventures, you know? And if you're lucky..., you might just have another adventure tonight. - Is that right? - That's right. How are you, Hercules? Iolaus, what the hell are you doing here? Well, you know, I was on my way to Prodraya to get some seeds and, uh..., I couldn't pass up the chance to dropin' on my old pal. Oh, thank you, I appreciate it! - Well... - Yeah..., things look pretty good for you here. - Yeah. - Huh. Things are pretty good for me. I've got some, uh, stuff coming up over there and I've got some... new things planted just over here. It's all turning out pretty... green. How about you? How are your crops doing? Well, uh, not too good. Oh, I can't get the hang of this manure thing, you know? I mean, it's either too much or there's not enough or... Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. I... can't figure out what to do with manure either. Do you... Do you mash it in? No, I kinda s..., uh, spread it all around, you know? Maybe I should mash it in and find it works. Wait... When I do it, I just... What the hell are we talking about? I've no idea. Oh. Let's go up to the house, give you somethin' to drink, and we can talk about somethin' we give a damn about. Maybe I'm not cut out to be a farmer. I mean, how excited can you get about something coming up from the ground? Huh, you can't. Unless, of couse, it's got a mouth full of fangs and it's trying to bite your face off. Remember that hydra Hera throw to us? Keep back, Iolaus! Don't, Iolaus. Don't provoke it. Hercules, what are you doing? Look out! Come on. Come on, let's get outta here. - This thing stinks. - Yeah. What in the hell was that? That's Ania, the day after you marry her. Hey. Iolaus, grab that torch! - But the gods, they'll be angry! - Just get it! Here! They're after me! Iolaus, the torch! Quick! Give it to me! Boy, I tell you what, Hercules. That fight with the hydra, that was really something, huh? You know, I wouldn't trade those times for anything. - Yeah. - Hmm. Well, I guess when you, uh..., got a good friend..., you get through a lot, huh? Well, thanks. Well, you know, I'll... I'll always be that friend. Well..., actually I-I was talking about me. I was the friend that got you through a lot, okay? - Iolaus, don't. - What? You know what. Any time we are apart from each other, you show up here thinking you can beat me. Well..., maybe this time I can. See, that's exactly what I'm talking about! No, no, no, seriously. Listen. I've been talking to this guy from the East. He taught me all these new fighting techniques. How a smaller guy can beat a bigger guy. All you've gotta do is be clever. Oh. Well, that's counts you out. Yeah. No! Okay, you can joke all you want. You're just scared. It's not going to work. I'm not fighting you. Hmm, so Hercules's a little scared, huh? Iolaus, listen to me. There's no way I'm going to fall for this, all right? I'm not... going to fight you. Alright, let's see these new moves. Okay. Actually, you have to attack me. What are you talking about? These are defensive moves. You've got to come at me, come on. Didn't touch me. What do you think? I, uh... I think you're a dead man. Ooh. I've got a move for anything you do. - Yeah? - Yeah. Now, what if I do... this?! No! Wow! Well, I hope you learnt some eastern swimming techniques! Mommy, what's Daddy doing to Uncle Iolaus? I... don't know, sweetie. I was really wondering the same thing myself. Well... We were just, uh... Hey, what are you doing up so late? You should be at sleep. She was sleeping, until somebody woke her up. Oh, well... Uh... Then, uh, back to bed... we go. Come on! How many times have I told you not to beat up Hercules? - Who, me? - Yes, you. Well, I had a couple of moves I wanted to try. He's just lucky you arrived when you did, that's all. Yeah. Well, we're lucky you showed up when you did too. - What do you mean? - Well... He's been so distracted lately, you know? It's like... It's like he's going stir crazy just being around the house. Yeah, well, I know what that's like. You know, I... I never would've thought it was so difficult being a father and a mother. Hmm. Ania would be so proud of you. I just wish she could see me, that's all. Come here. Hercules! Hercules! Are you Hercules? Uh, no, no, I'm a... I'm Hercules. Oh, look, you've got to come with me! You're the only one. Calm down, calm down. What happened? It got my brother! - What did? - It was a monster or some kind! - Did you see it? - Yes, sort of, but it was dark. - What happened to your brother? - I don't know, it was horrible. And then it came after me and I barely got away. You've got to come back to Alturia and help me save my brother! - What do you think? - I, uh... I think my place is here. - I-I'm afraid I can't help you. - What?! But you've got to, you're the only one. I'm sorry, I can't. - I'm sorry. - But... you're Hercules. Why did you tell him no? What do you mean? I'm settled down now. I know. But you-you're thinking maybe you should go. No, I don't know what I am thinking. I mean, turning him down was... was really hard on me. Part of me inside of me was saying... "go"! Of course it was, because that's who you are. No. No. That's who I was. I've got you and the kids to think about now. Honey, you're never gonna be happy that way. You're Hercules, don't try to change that, not for me, not for the kids. You'd only be lying to yourself. So you think I should go? The way you've been acting lately? I think you need to go. - Have I been that bad? - No, no. Okay. You've been worse. You didn't have to come, you know? But what was I going to do? Stay home and plant another row of cabbages? Come on. Besides, somebody's got to be there to bail you out. - Bail me out? - Uh-huh. But you? Hey, laugh all you want, but you know it's true. Remember that time we went to Phenia? Obviously not the way you remember it. Okay. What about the time Hera's priest jumped you at Talladon, huh? Huh? Hey, you were in a lot of trouble when I arrived. I wasn't in any trouble until you arrived. - You started it all, remember? - Yeah, yeah. Right. Okay, here's one. - The sea snakes in Thrace. - Ah. You were up to your neck in serpent's lime, buddy, until guess who arrived to save the day. Alright, alright, I admit it. You saved the day. See? See? I'm always there when you need me, Hercules! So where were you the time I had to face Gargon the Giant? It can't be! Shut the door! Here, quickly! Please! Any-Anything you want! I want... Hercules! Hercules? The... There's no Hercules here! What would Hercules be doing in a crumby place like this?! Then I kill everybody! No! Please! I'm Hercules. What can I do for you? You are Hercules?! I didn't come all this way to kill something as small as you! Fine by me. Look, why don't you sit down, have some stew? First, you! Then, stew! Come on, little man. Be careful. You know, this really... isn't necessary. Oh, yes it is. Look! You don't have to do this...! Looks like Hercules has finally met his match. I beg your pardon, sir. I don't think so. What do you know, old man? Oh, I know about these things. Maybe we do have to do this. Now I kill you! Now, what a second, Hercules, wait. What's all this about him swanning you around? The last time I heard the story, you said... you knocked him cold, he didn't touch you. Oh. Well, I guess I... forgot about that part, partner. Hey, I've had a lot of fights, it's hard to remember every details of everyone. Yeah. I bet it's hard to remember a lot of things when you've taken as many punches as you have. Oh, laugh it off, laugh it off. The best fighting I've ever seen you do is fighting to pick yourself up off the ground. Hey! Anyway, I hope whatever we meet in Alturia is big, and stupid enough to want to test our skills. Help! Somebody help me! - Come on! - Help me! That's not funny. You should've seem the look on your faces. All eager and ready for action! Yeah, well, a bit of action would be nice. I mean, farming's all very well, but... I thought you guys had settled down. Well... Well, some guy... came asking for help, was I supposed to say no? I mean... No. No, no, it's not. You love to help people! But, uh... Hey, you've got a... Your look on your face, you're healthy. I haven't seen such spirit in you since we squared off on Mount Ethion. Of course, I wasn't so pleased to see you then. Stop! Go back. - Get out of my way. - Don't you move. I told you to go back! I'm going in there. You may be the strongest man in the world, but remember: I'm still... the king of the gods. Hercules... Stay back. Get back to the cave! Don't do this. You are pushing me, boy. The next one will not be aimed at your feet! You could really kill me, couldn't you? I am trying to save you. Why can't you understand that?! The lives of all those people? I care about people. It so happens... I care more about you. Father! I love you too. But I... still have to do this. So, I saved my son's life for about the... hundredth time, right? You know..., it's funny because, uh..., when Hercules tells that story it's always the other way around. - Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure. - Hey, Iolaus. I, uh... I think I owe you this. You've gotta... You've got some change coming, pal! Ooh, I'm scared, I'm scared. You guys are like kids. You've got kids yourselves! Yeah. That's with kids. It's, uh..., funny, isn't it? Well, not when you go to change them and they spray in your face. Ah, there's nothing greater in creation than kids. Then they grop up..., and they become problems. You know, I... don't remember the ground being so damn hard. - You're getting old. - Yeah, so many bugs. Why bugs, anyway? Because birds love to eat them. I do everything for a reason. Hey, Hades is giving a party tonight, and... I think we'd have a wonderful time. Let-Let-Let's go, would you like that? No, we have to get up early to... make it to Alturia by tomorrow. - Alturia? - Yeah. Yeah, there's, uh, some kind of monster on the loose there, and, uh, we're going to kick its butt. - I wouldn't go to Alturia. - Why not? I don't know, I was there a couple of months ago and the... the food was bad. The food was bad? You know, Alturia is the spice capital of the world. Yeah, spice eats up your stomach. Yeah, but... we're still going. Besides, you're the one who said I needed an adventure. And this is it. Well, I have to go to Hades. He'll be upset if I don't show up. You, uh, have a nice time. And you... have a nice adventure. - Where are you taking me? - Away! No one's gonna keep us apart anymore. Not your father, not my fahter, not anybody. But you should've told me. I would've packed something. - Like what? - Some clothes maybe? What do we need clothes for? Come on. Let's stop all this talking. Oh, look. This looks like a good place. Come on. Why are you breathing so loud? Me? I thought it was you. What are you? What am I? The next ruler of this world. That's what I am. Why are you doing this to us? Oh, don't worry yourself. Soon you will come back reneived without all these questions. Ready to do exactly as I command. Oh, it's good! You know, this town doesn't... seem so upset. You mean, for a town that's supposedly plagued by a monster? - Exactly. - Yeah. It doesn't look too upset. Excuse me. This... is Alturia, isn't it? Always has been. Well, we were told that there was something terrible happening here. - Like a monster. - Hmm. Where did you hear that? A man from here. He... came to my home saying his brother had been taken by some... sort of beast. His brother, huh? What does this guy look like? - Well... - Well, he's about..., like, this tall, kind of wirey, dark hair... You came all this way for nothing. The one you met is Dannius. His brother, Andius. They're the town idiots. And if you're stupid enough to believe in anything they told you, then your idiots too. Uh, thank you, madam. Hey, everybody! Guess what I just heard! Dannius says there's a monster in town! You know, it... didn't seem like he was kidding. Yeah, he did look kind of crazy, though. Well... - I guess that takes care of that. - Yep. So, uh..., what now? How about I buy you a drink? Ah... Well, only if I can buy you one. Okay. Well, well, well. Of all the people in the world..., so Hercules is finally here. The big hero, son of Zeus. You have no idea what it feels like to be reviled, do you? To be spit upon like I've been. But you will. By my hand, you will learn fear, you will learn humiliation..., you will learn death! Oh, so you came. I knew it was only a matter of time. What? You haven't seen me in over a hundred years and this is your greeting? Maybe you're shocked. Did you forget what you turned me into? Did you forget what a vile beast you made me?! Fitting punishment, I'd say. You'd say?! You'd say?! And who are you to say?! You haven't changed, have you? Being locked away in this place... hasn't taught you anything?! Oh, but it has. I've learnt the power of hate, I've lived on it. I've grown stronger on it! I should have killed you then. So do it now. You can't do it, can you? Not then..., and not now. I'll leave you down here... for another hundred years. Go ahead! Every day in here I get bigger. Every day I get stronger! Can't you see this won't end?! Not until I have what I want! What do you want? To see you suffer. To make you drink as much pain and misery as you poured down my throat. You can't touch me..., and you know it. Oh, don't be so sure. Hmm. Couple of ales, please. - You got money? - Yeah, we got money. Then you're gonna eat. I've never seen you here before. I like that in a man. - You two have names? - Yeah, uh, I'm Iolaus, and, uh..., this is my friend, Hercules. Oh. Another Hercules, huh? What do you mean by that, "another Hercules"? Oh, come on, we get five of you guys a week in here claiming to be Hercules. Every idiot with half a brain. That's what they did to the last one. You better keep it to yourself. You're not real big. I'd hate to see what they do to you. Well, uh..., thanks for the advice. Hey, wait a minute! This really is Hercules! So he's got you fooled, huh? You must be a bright one. No, no, this really is him. I've been on all sorts of adventures with this guy! - A bunch of them! - Oh, really?! Like what?! Well, uh... Like, there was this time, uh..., this a guy came to see us from, uh..., Gargarencia. You know, this village of his was being attacked by all these... savage beasts, and no one knew where they came from. So, where are these beasts? I hope we haven't come all this way for nothing. Oh, be patient, we'll find them soon enough. Yeah, yeah. Hey. What do you think? Some kind of warning? Maybe it's just the way these beasts have fun. Over there. Keep your eyes open, Iolaus. They're watchin' us right now. I can feel it. Me too. Well, Iolaus..., you wanted an adventure. - Where'd my sword go? - Who needs a sword? Forget it. - Yeah, thanks. - Hold on. - Be careful, Iolaus. - No, be reckless. Careful dies, reckless kills. Fantastic, aren't they?! No, Iolaus! Stay at my back! I've heard enough of this crap. So... we've got another one, huh? Another hero in our midst. - Don't say I didn't warn you. - Hey. Everyone. Guess what? This is... Hercules. An honour to meet you..., Hercules. - And you are...? - My name... is Trikonis. Uh, it's, uh..., nice to meet you. Yeah. Do you know what? I don't think you're really Hercules. I think you're a dirty..., stinking..., rotten... liar. If you don't mind..., I'll finish my drink in peace. I really doubt that. Listen, pal! You got a problem with Hercules, you got a problem with me. Then I guess you've got a lot of problems. Why don't you, uh..., show this guy how they fight in the East? Okay. That was okay. Herc! Watch this. - Iolaus, you alright? - Yeah, I'm great! You... and me..., - we're not over yet. - Yes we are. No. I'm going to smash your head... until your brains come out. Really? Really! Do you have any rooms to rent in this place? Uh... Yeah. Yeah, we do. Take two. This time... Hercules dies. I don't care if he is the real damn Hercules. I'm gonna show him how we run things in this town. And I've got his first lession right here. Hercules is mine. Remember that. You can get your fun by kicking the crap out of that runt friend of his. Now come on. This way. Who's there? - Hercules?! - By the gods, he's massacred them! We've got to do something, Martan! W-W-What are we gonna do?! No, look, I... I didn't have anything to do with this. Mom, why did Hercules kill them? That's right! Why did you do it, Hercules?! I... I didn't kill them. You're gonna pay for this, Hercules, pay with your life! - I told you, I didn't do this. - Then-Then who did, huh?! - I've no idea! - Well, we do. Give him justice! Yeah! What's going on?! Iolaus. Wake up, now! - Can't we talk about this tomorrow? - No. We've got trouble. - Good trouble? - Bad trouble. - Little trouble? - Big trouble. - What the hell's going on? - I've no idea, but I'm not waiting around to find out. Kill Hercules! - Is there a back door in this place? - No, there isn't. There is now. My wall! Kill Hercules! You know, all I can hear... is "let's get Hercules". I don't hear anything about Iolaus! Ah, this is not good. Out the back! He's getting away out the back! Get him! They went down here! Kill Hercules! Kill him! Down here! Kill him! Like I told you before, you're all making a big mistake. It's you who made a mistake, Hercules. When you butchered those men. I'm warning you. I haven't hurt anybody yet. But if you don't turn around and go home now, that's gonna change. Yeah. We're gonna hurt you! Yeah. Help me! Somebody help me! - Hercules! - Don't! Come on! Come on! Hercules, he's gone! What is that?! Now do you believe me?! Do you know where this thing lives? - Yeah. - Then take me there. It's this way. - Father! - Hercules. - What are you doing here? - I need to talk to you, son. But Hercules, come on! We've gotta go. It's alright. It's okay, I'll be right there. Father, I... I don't have time. Something has got Iolaus... - and I've gotta... - He won't kill Iolaus. He wants... to kill you. And how would you know that? Because I know what's down there. A monsterous beast. What, you seen this thing before? He was a wonderful child. As a man, more handsome than Adonis. - That became his curse. - What curse? He had a lot of followers... trying to turn him against the gods, then against to each other. Anyone who resisted, he murdered. - So why is he after me? - He's not. He's after me, for what I did to him. I made him as ugly as his heart. Now he wants... revenge. What's going on? You're not telling me everything. I once had the chance... to kill him. But I couldn't. Why can't you tell me the truth? I don't want to hurt you, son. I never asked you to do anything for me. I'm asking you now. Do... what I can't. Kill him. In there. Down there! That's where he lives. Hercules! Wait! Wait! W-We're going with ya. - What are you guys doing here? - We owe it to you, - after what we did in the town. - Yeah. - It took our people too. - Yeah. Alright, just... stay behind me. Where are we going?! I don't know. Wherever this leads us. Which one do we take? This one. This place is a maze. With all these twists and turns, we'll be lost for sure. Here. Drag this behind you. It will mark our path so we can find our way back out. I'm telling you, we're already lost. - Let's turn back. - Shut up, Martan! You're the one who wanted to come down here in the first place. Well, I don't know. We're all in this together. No, we're not. I'm getting out! Then go. Why don't you go with your friend? Nope. I'm going with you. Great... Wait. I only left one trail. No. This isn't happening. It can't be. There's no way out. He's dead. Poor thing. Where are you?! Show yourself, you coward! You'll see me soon enough. Come on. It's, uh..., pretty tight. I don't think you can make it. I'll make it. Don't worry. Hercules. What is it? I think I'm stuck. Yeah. - I'll give you a hand. - Yep. Come on! Come on, suck it on! You can make it. - Come on! - No! No, no, no. No, I'm stuck! I... Too bad you had such a big dinner. Hercules..., it's-it's behind me. No. No! Yes. No!!! Damn you! Where are you?! Come on, face me! Come on, where are you?! Well, well, well. Look who finally decided to drop in. Hercules! Welcome to my home. Do you like? Large, yes. But a little damp and cold. Kind of like a big stone grave! Hercules..., the favourite son of Zeus..., pride of the king of the gods. What's the matter? Do I frighten you? Does the very sight of me offend you? Good. Because that's exactly what am I: an offense. And it was your father who made me this way. From what I hear, you deserved it. And what do you know about deserving? You've had everything given to you your whole life. Strength, fame, and glory. No. I've earned what I have. It was given to you by a god, a pathetic old man who showers his precious boy with all the world... while I live in a nightmare. Well, now it's Zeus's turn for a nightmare! And it starts when I toss your head... in his lap. When does it end? With my army storming his heavens. I will be the new king of the gods! Sounds like a solid plan. Except it's got one flaw. Flaw? What flaw? Me. Guess things didn't work out like you planned. Can't say I'm sorry. Hercules! You wouldn't really kill your own... brother, would you? Brother? Zeus had the chance to kill me once, but why didn't he?! Why didn't he kill me? Because he couldn't bring himself to kill his own son. You should have done it. Come on. Fight me! No. You're my brother. Fight me! I want to prove which son of Zeus is more powerful! I won't do it. Then you can watch your friend die. No!!! Son, I... - I wanted to tell you... - No, it's... - Just... couldn't. - it's alright. I understand. I'm... just sorry you... had to lose a son. I lost him years ago. Father. We shouldn't have allowed this to happen. The day you turned against me... was the saddest day of my life. I loved you, son. If you only hadn't made this necessary. Please, don't let me die this way. You're free now. It's okay! Iolaus, it's alright. - He's dead. - Oh. Come on, let's get the rest out. Andius. - Andius! - Danion! Where's your father? Oh, he's... probably headed home. Same thing, uh..., you and I should be doing. Yeah, let's get out of here. Well, Iolaus, that... - was an interesting adventure. - Huh. A little more dangerous than I remember it being. Yeah, say that again. I almost got killed by a monster. I don't think I wanna do that for a while. Oh, me either. Spending time with my wife and kids... is all the adventure I'm looking for right now. Yeah. I second that. And by the way, there's something I forgot to give you. What's that? - Ow. - I have an excellent memory. You better get moving or you'll have an excellent funeral. - So long. - So long. Dad! Mommy! Mommy! Daddy's home!
