We never talked about this. Please, stop! Untie me. I won't go on. Get out of here! Get out! Go! OK, thanks. Wait. Give me just a second. Are you ready for the next one? OK. How did you know we were here? Have you been following me? -OK, but a bit faster. -Yes. How did you know we were here? How did you know we were here? Have you been following me? OK. Once more. More emphatic. How did you know we were here? Have you been following me? More powerful, Inés. How did you know we were here? Have you been following me? OK. Done. Well, have a nice trip, young lady. Thanks! Bye. There are eight emergency exits on this aircraft. Two at the front, four in the middle, and two at the back of the plane. Emergency lighting will lead you to the exits. Locate the exit closest to you. Let's see. You have to leave it upright now. I'll call the flight attendant. Please. Yes, sir? I think it doesn't lean back all the way. Let me see. Excuse me. Could you change our seats? No, the flight is full. Maybe when we stop in Santiago. We were told it was a direct flight. It is direct, via Santiago. We'll spend an hour in Chile. Maybe we can find you another seat then. Anyway, it has to be upright for takeoff, sir. That's OK. Thanks. I'll send the travel agency a legal notice when we get back. Enough, Leopoldo. We're about to take off. Are you nervous? I told you I am scared of flying. Look what I brought you. -No. I don't want it. -How come? -It's bad for me. -Nonsense! It's just a pill. -I don't want it. -It's just a pill! You put it under your tongue and forget it all. I just had one. I didn't take effect! -Come on! -I don't want it. Come on! It's nothing. So? Was it that bad? Yes, what do you need? I didn't call you. Yes, you did. Oh... it must've been a mistake. Would you like a glass of water? No. No, thanks. I'll try to sleep. Can I give you some advice? This man... is he your boyfriend? I don't know if I'd call him that. We haven't been dating for long. I've been watching you. I think this man isn't right for you. Should I kill him now? No! No! Hey. Sorry. You were dreaming. Sorry. Are you OK? Do you need anything? She was dreaming. It's OK. -Miss, are you OK? -Are you OK? -Yes. -Sure? -I scratched you. -It's nothing. -You were dreaming. -Yes. Who were you talking to? Your dad? I can send the pictures by email. The entire package of photos is $450, and if you agree, we will send them to you. Yes, we'd like that. OK, look at the camera. One, two... very good. Great. Let me see the photo. It's good, look honey. Yes, it's OK. OK, we'll swim ahead now. Remember to be quiet, and not to touch anything, OK? Let's go. Impressive. I told you, didn't I? Didn't I? What was that? Bats that live in the cave. All those are bats? They're sleeping. If we keep quiet, they won't fly. Where did you bring me, Leopoldo? -Calm down. -No, easy. Easy. You're heading towards more bats. -There are no more bats here. -Inés. -Tell her. -If you head out, you should know there won't be a refund. OK? Inés. The little bats! Come on, let's have a good time. Thanks. Just a sec. To the man of your dreams. Who is he? Aren't you gonna tell me? -No. -No? You were talking to somebody in your sleep. Who was that? You're not telling me? You can tell me anything, you know. -Yes, I know. -You know? -Yes. -Are you sure? Sure. So? It was your ex. Stop. -Please, stop. -It was your ex. Let's enjoy. Yeah... -I'm a drag. -Yes. -You're a drag. -Yeah, I'm a drag. I'm a drag, mas eu te amo. What about you? What about you? Do you love me? We're not in Brazil. Let's welcome Leopoldo from Argentina. -Leopoldo. -I'm up. Yes. Thanks. For Inés. I feel the warmth of your skin on my body again Shooting star, trigger my thirst Mysterious woman With your sensual love You give me so much Inés. Make my dream Come true Give me your soul today Do your magic Take me to the world Where I can dream... The key wasn't right for me. You asked them to change the key? No, but... It wasn't right for me. It was awful. -What? You were off? -You don't sing. You can't sing. That's it. You talk a lot, but... -Sing it again. -Come, I can't with this. You talk a lot, but I don't hear you sing. What? I must know whether it's true I don't know which key you used. -It wasn't like that. -Show me. -What was it like? -I just wanted... Don't mock me. I love you. What? What is it? You said, "I love you." What? What were you dreaming? You never tell me you love me. Of course I do. No, let's see... When do you tell me you love me? I don't know. When we fuck. Was it an erotic dream? I dream whatever I feel like dreaming. Yes, it was an erotic dream... ...but not with me, right? This is the last thing: you monitoring my dreams, too. Inés... It's all good. Everything's fine. Jerk. I was just asking who were you talking to. That's all I want to know. What are you doing? Inés, open up. Inés, tell me who it was. Who were you talking to? Just tell me. Enough! Open up, please! Let's talk about it... Get lost! I can't stand you anymore! It was a dream, wasn't it? Can you tell me who were you talking to? You had to be talking to someone. Leave me alone! Back off! Stop it! Shut up! Inés, don't be silly. If you care so much, I'll tell you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Asshole! Open up! Will you shut up? You talk more than my mom! You've been talking nonstop since we got on the plane. Inés. It's a nightmare I keep having since I was a child. I'm trying to sleep... I feel there's someone outside... that calls me... asks me to open the window. I know who it is. Inés. Open up. Leopoldo... It's not a joke. It's not funny. Leopoldo, is that you? Leopoldo? Is that you? Leopoldo! THE INTRUDER Very well. Please, control the release. This starts fortissimo and goes decrescendo till it becomes almost imperceptible. Control it gently, but firmly. -Understood? -Yes, maestro. OK. Very good. OK, let's see. Sopranos. Wait. One at a time. Very good. Very good. Do I have to imagine it? I'm not hearing you, Inés. Let's go again. Again. Wait. Let's do this. Move over with the mezzos. You will find the passaggio easier. But I'm a soprano, maestro. I know. But you need to be comfortable. Go on. We're trying to get some work done here. We can't rehearse with that noise. Let's put off the rehearsal, girls. We'll resume when they're done with the organ. Bye, see you, girls. Bye. Good luck. -Maestro, regarding the change... -Did you go see Ketty? -I did, two months ago. -What did she say? We did some exercises, vocalization, she sent me to the laryngologist. -Klavotinsky? -Mallea. So? Nodules? Nothing. He told me see a neurologist. Did you? I did. I had a CT scan and other tests done. And what did he say? Stress. He referred me to another psychiatrist. -And did you go? -I did. And he gave me some pills. But I'm not taking them. Why not? Because they give me nightmares. Look. I'm giving you these. These are the pills I take. These are great. Take them. The heels. The little heels. What heels? Your heels. I heard them all night until 4:30 in the morning, walking up and down. We couldn't sleep. Some people work very early in the morning. People who have to work for a living, you know? And again today. Since you started earlier, I came to talk to you 'cause you're driving me insane. Nice to meet you. I'm Inés. Nancy. Are you sure it came from this apartment? Yes, I live right below you. If it wasn't you, then it was someone in your apartment. I live alone. And I went to bed early last night. I would change the lock if I were you. I'll follow your advice. Good night. Good night. Here! Here, bitch! Take it, you fucking bitch! OK. Let's move on to the breaths. From 0:43. Do you need to see the scene? -No need. -Good. Remember: three breaths for the struggle. Plus one with the downward move. Inés, sorry. Could you grab an object, please? So... I'll play it once more. Remember you go after the third beep. -Just a sec. -OK. Excellent. I think that's it. Just a sec. Gotta check something and I'll let you go. What? What did you say? What did you say, Inés? "I'll tie you"? "I'll kill you"? That's not here. It must be from another scene. Sorry. Let me check something. What did you say? I must've heard the playback... No, it's off. I'll be right back. Inés, did you touch the mic? Sorry. No. I hear distortion and I don't know where it comes from. I changed the cable this morning. We have to retake everything? Don't worry. I'll fix it later with some plug-in. Did the headphones cause an interference? No, I would've noticed. Remember when we dubbed Lord of the Rings we heard a constant noise? Turned out it was the old man who dubbed Gandalf. He had a pacemaker. These are electromagnetic issues. A vibration bumps into another and that produces a buzz. I'll figure it out. -We're done. -OK. -Come in now. -Thanks. There's not much room, but... Thanks. See you. The place is small, let's stand in a circle. Hello? -I'll help you. -Inés. -I dreamed about you last night. -And here I am. We're connected, honey. Why didn't you tell me you were coming? I sent you a message, you didn't get it? That's odd. Anyway, let me see you. You look pretty. I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the airport. Mom, that was three months ago. Of course, three months. It's true. I got a flat tire driving off the estate. It's such a mess. We haven't recovered from the floods. It's awful. -This way, right? -Yeah. -Are you OK? -Yeah. Honey... You must've suffered so much, baby. Nice place. Leopoldo's family was really awful. And you were there, all by yourself. I couldn't come because of the floods. We lost almost the entire crop. But they... ...they had no excuse. I wasn't alone. His sister traveled. What sister? Leopoldo's sister, Mom. I told you a thousand times. But it's true. They weren't very nice. And because of an argument. Despite what you might've told him in the heat of an argument... I mean, I used to tell your father some terrible things. But no one would've dared to blame me for his behavior, which was complicated. People are really something. Once you had found someone you liked. He seemed like a good guy. I mean, someone to start a family with. I still cannot process it. It's not like we were going to get married. It was something very recent. If you want to have a pleasant stay, don't talk about it. And don't start asking if I didn't notice he was depressed, if I didn't notice he drank. I heard enough over the phone. We're just talking. My, what a temper. Did you have something done? No. No. Inés! The rehearsal was canceled. Nobody told me. I'm not at my best these days. Me neither, don't worry. How do you know my name? From the rehearsals. The maestro calls you often. Do you know why it was canceled? According to them, because of me. I really don't know how to tune an organ silently. Hi. Hi. You use that remote to tune it? Yes. I don't know what happened. It's not working. Can I help you... from here? To tune it? Sure. Thanks. Sorry. I think you told me your name and I forgot. No, I didn't tell you. I'm Alberto. Alberto. -Hi. -How are you? Oops... Sorry. -Hi, good morning. -Hi, honey. Good morning. Have you been up for long? Just a little while. I've been tidying up a bit. I see. I didn't hear you. They dropped this for you. Who? María Clara? No, a young man. I'll remember his name in a minute. He said you'd forgotten the scores the other day. He couldn't stay. He was in a hurry. I invited him in, but he refused. He earnestly insisted that you got those. He said "earnestly." Such a nice word, isn't it? Was it Alberto? Could be. He looked like an "Alberto". Yes. Well, now that I think about it... he's a bit of a fairy, right? -Nonsense, Mom. -Why? Because he's a musician, not a rugby player. Listen, he was very polite. Very attentive. When I invited him in to wait for you, he said he didn't want to be a bother. I'll get it. Maestro, how are you? Yes, I'm fine. Yes, maestro, I'm fine. Don't worry. I didn't know. She didn't tell me. Yes, I'll talk to her. OK, bye, maestro. Thanks. Something wrong, honey? You can't call the maestro to talk about me. I'm not a child. I didn't call him. I swear, cross my heart. I don't even have his number. How would I do something like that? How dare he say that. Sometimes people don't know how to say something. Maybe he used it as an excuse to call you. Maybe he saw you are in low spirits. Do you think the maestro would make up something like that? Maybe he wanted to cheer you up. You're a hypocrite. It's always the same with you. You're having voice problems. I don't have any problem. Let's see. It's just a phlegm. Remember? The palate... and the ischium well placed on the chair. Above the phlegm. Now you, honey. You. Precious. Come on. Mommy, he lent us the video. We want to stay a little bit longer. Do you hear that crack at the back, like a constant "chicki-chicki-chicki"? No. -Could it be the mic? -No, no. It's not the mic or the cable. I tried to delete it, but it's in the harmonics. I don't get it. Is your cell phone on? No. Do you have anything like an arrhythmia or a murmur? I think we should try this in the other room. But it'd be in the night shift. You didn't notice it, right? You didn't hear it? I'll play it again. I'll play it slowly, to see if you can hear it. It's an intruder. There's an intruder. You have nightmares? Intense dreams? That's how they enter. What? Libertad Lamarque used to have one. It was hard to remove it. She had to go into exile. Hi, Adela. Just a moment. Sound engineers say they're just sounds, but they're something else. The thing is, where do those sounds come from? Where do they come from? They escape. Nobody knows where they come from. They turn up in dreams, and they cross over. First, you hear them, right? Then, you see them. They come closer, they surround you and suddenly, they take hold of you. Very good. Breathe softly, breathe softly... Perfect. Now laugh. Perfect. Now a glissando. Very good. Sing something. Very good, perfect. We'll pull out... perfect. Inés, your vocal chords are just fine. Your larynx is in great shape. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Choir Happy birthday to you Let's blow them out. All right! What a surprise! Maestro, what an honor! It's such an honor. Thank you. Where were you from? From a small town. I'm new here. Why? When did you come from Pirovano? How do you know I'm from there? Your mom told me. Such a nice lady. I hadn't had such fun in a long time. I'm recovering from a difficult situation. It's hard to explain. Don't look at me like that. I won't look at you if you don't want me to. No. Do it. Look at me. Please. -Hi. -Hi. How are you? Come in. Stand here. Sorry. I have to connect the mic. There. See what happens with the phone when I put it near the mic. See? Chitarroni says the same happens with bodies when they emit some vibration or electromagnetic current. OK, speak up. I'll record it. "Chapter II: Etiology. Some vibrations produced by the body are imperceptible to the ear: Arrhythmia, a murmur, even the synapse. In some cases, its acoustic effect is very disturbing. Some patients hear what they describe as words, even full phrases, or, in some cases, melodies. With phonic demagnetization, we've managed to cancel these phases and successfully solve the problem." Wait. I got it here. I'll isolate it. I'll play it for you. They seem like words. They do, right? What did you hear? I don't know. I'll play it again. It's pointless to keep recording, right? The same will happen. What will I do? I saw a doctor. It's not a heart murmur or an arrhythmia. Maybe you're stressed? It's OK. You're probably very tense, charged. Many people who work on TV or the radio in direct contact with mics or antennas go to see Chitarroni. Yeah, but it costs a fortune. Yeah. You can do it? It's very easy, really. OK. Next. Another. Another. There. Do you hear it? The beating? Yes. That's it. Only the third one left. But we'll do it tomorrow, OK? Thanks for your help. It's easier than using the remote. This type of buzz could it be produced by other things? Sure. For instance, play the last "F." Do you hear? The beating disappeared. Because I regulated the air column. That can happen with any instrument... ...and your voice, too. This is all we tuned today. Look. These are the battle trumpets. Clarion. Trumpet. Bombard. Every little tube is a note. This... is like a lung that holds air. Do you know the name? The windchest. What's up there? We should leave now, you know? Body temperature can ruin the tuning. Sure. I have to leave, anyway. Inés, are you OK? What happened? -There was a bug. -Where? Where did you see it? No, honey. It was a dream. You were dreaming. Easy. Easy. I'll stay with you. The important thing here is not the magnet, you can use anything that records the variations. Some people use batteries, others use flashlights with wires, but I don't like it, it could shock you. A friend who works in migrations got me this one. -Are we gonna electrocute ourselves? -No, don't worry. It's just to scan the charged areas. See this little graphic right here? Once I find it, I turn intensity up, and attract it. It'll pass on to you? No, it'll pass on to the cable. OK. Calm down, stay relaxed and still. Sorry, but I have to slide it closely. Do you hear that feedback? That's your body. Here, with your sweater... ...I can't get a read. Wait. Ready. We know each other. Easy. It's OK. Relax. -Did you get hurt? -No, no. All this is a bit rudimentary. It's OK. Let's see... I'll turn it on. This is my first time. But it should work. Look, here it is. Check this out. We discharged 53,000 milliwatts. It's a lot. Silence, girls. Silence. We are on in a few minutes. So let's be quiet. Focus. Are you nervous? -Yeah. -A little bit, right? If you feel nervous, look at me. Focus on my hands. OK? But it's alright. Everything's going to be alright. Get ready. We're up. Don't forget your folders. Everyone with their own folder. Line up. -Are you all ready? Yes? -Yes, maestro. Fine. Let's go. The bathroom is like a pharmacy. What's this? Prescriptions from two weeks ago. Verexidril on an empty stomach and Ariplex twice a day. And there's another name, but I can't make it out. Otamol. We have to figure out what to do with Inés. What should a mother do in a situation like this? -Should I give her more drugs? -No. Should I have her committed? Help me, Alberto. Take it easy. We still have time. Thanks. I need to talk to Adela. What happened? Come in. -Hello? -Adela? It's Inés, the one with the intruder. Sorry to bother you this late, but I just ran into my ex-boyfriend... my dead ex-boyfriend. Have you been dreaming about him? Yes. From that moment, things started to happen. You're surrounded by intruders. You have to get in the dream and kick them out before they get hold of you. What? You will get in the dream. You have to follow my instructions carefully. There's a small bed in the room. Nelson, you'll be Inés' guide. It's my mom. She's looking for me. Phones off. You can't wake up in the middle of the dream. Hold on. This will be helpful. Here. Tie your wrists to each other. You can use a rope, a lace... -A cable? -Perfect. Inés, Nelson will keep you grounded in case something goes wrong. What could go wrong? Everything, Inés. Relax. See you later. Close your eyes. Inés. We were desperate. Your mom was about to call the police. Where were you? Who are you? What do you mean, Inés? Hey. How did you know we were here? We have to go back. It's late. -Have you been following me? -No. Let's go. -Where's Nelson? -Who? -Nelson. -Who's Nelson? The sound engineer. -I don't know him. -What did you guys do to him? Let's go. Let's go. -We have to help him. -We have to go. Let's go. Where is he? What did we do to Nelson? Did you see him? I don't know who that is. Sweetheart. Did you get a good rest? You were going to call the police? What are you talking about? What? Me? You called me many times yesterday. No, honey. That was a dream. I'm sure. You have been stressing over the performance. Those pills you're taking... The pills... Yes, the pills. They make you see... things. Yes. I see things. You should see a psychiatrist. I could go with you. Or Alberto. That boy's a keeper. He's an angel. Hi, Inés. This is Robbie from the recording studio. I'm not sure what happened, but they told me that today's session was moved up to 12:00. Can you make it? OK. Bye. Where are you going? To work. You could change your clothes! Ready? Where's Nelson? I don't know. He must've taken a few days off. I was just told to come to work today. Give me a sec. Robbie, do you know where Nelson is? I think he had to go on a trip or something. What about Adela? The gray-haired actress. Um, Adela... I think she's in room nine finishing a walla. Adela. Newcomer, get a seat, quickly. Remember, it's hair salon atmosphere. Try to keep the tone. We're recording. Wait for the third beep. I don't know what happened. I'm scared. Do you want your nails done? What? Please, tell me what happened. I was about to make it, but I woke up. And Nelson... What happened to Nelson? I lost him in the dream. What will happen to him? He's stuck on the other side. OK. Cut. We're done with the hair salon. Now we move on to the funeral. Remember to use a neutral accent. I'm listening a lot of Río de la Plata accent. Stand up, please. We're recording. After the third beep. An intruder interrupted the trip... to stay here with us. -So? -Get rid of it, Inés. How? I'm not sure. I think they can only get in if you let them. If I let him... You fell in love with an intruder. You fell in love with an intruder. I don't know. It's up to you. It's out of my hands now. You gave him a place. Now try to get rid of him whatever way. I've done everything in my power. God bless you, dear. Hail Mary, full of grace The Lord is with thee Blessed art thou among women And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Why did he leave us? Mom? I'm getting home. Something happened? No, what do you mean to Pirovano? Are you OK? Did something happen? Who are you? Who am I? My mom just called. I'm your mom, pumpkin. My mom doesn't call me "pumpkin." She doesn't iron either. Leave. Now. -Get out. -I'm your mother. -Get out! -It's me, Marta, your mother! -Get out now! -Please, don't hurt me. -Don't hurt me. -Leave right now! Inés? She left. I told her to leave, and she left. Alberto! Open up! Open up, please! Open up! Open up, please! Alberto! Inés? You're an intruder. What? You're all intruders. You, Leopoldo, and that woman who says she's my mother. Leave now. Why? And then what? I don't know. What about us? Leave. I love you. -But... -But what? Why can't I stay? There's room for both of us. There's room... for both of us. There's room for both of us. I gave myself, I don't regret it I've never been happier And today I spend the day singing Not thinking of what's next. Love! I close my eyes and jump into the abyss Love! How could I refuse your warm abyss? Love Subtle narcotic, gentle and fragrant Love It can turn a diamond into dust... Me?
