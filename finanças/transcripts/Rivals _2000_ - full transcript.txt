(light music) Coming. Oh! Oh my god, help! Help me! Oh please, I need help! (woman screaming) (woman screaming) (hooves clopping) (lightly suspenseful music) (tires screeching) (van honking) (rock music) (woman giggling) (jackhammer clanging) (van honking) (tires screeching) Help. I have no idea what to wear. I know, I know. I should have unpacked weeks ago. So what is your friend's Samantha wearing, honey? Trust me, mom, even you've got more fashion sense than she does. Oh, well thank you darling. And she's not my friend. I have no friends. You know, I'm just gonna tell her I don't wanna go. (rock music) (man laughing) (tires screeching) (van honking) Look out, you jerk! (doorbell ringing) I'm such a loser. I'm just gonna tell her I'm not going. Honey, you couldn't even fake being a loser. It's just a matter of time before you're discovered. In fact, tonight is a great opportunity to be discovered. Mom. I'll have a video camera in front of my face. Hi. Hey. Oh God, am I too dressed up? Oh, no, don't stress on it. We're going for one reason and one reason only, to document the nineties rural American teenager and all its hideousness. (rock music) (screaming) I can't stand it! It's too perfect. Adorable. God, you nearly scared me half to death. I can't believe that. I have to do a painting. It's awesome, isn't it? Personally, I find it mind-numbing. Oh, come on. The city is what's mind numbing. This is so... Oh, man. Here comes the queen and her fool. (van honking) Get outta the way, boneheads! What's with him? (tires screeching) (van honking) Come on, move it! (tires screeching) Get outta the way! (tires screeching) Look out! (Laurie screaming) (horse braying) Honest retard! Jeez! Idiots! God almighty. (rock music) Say hi. Hi, hi. (guests chattering) Say hi to the camera. (guests chattering) Hi, Tabitha. Come on. Michelle. You're the odds on favor for queen. Do you want to tell us about the dress? I made it. You sewed those beads on? Absolutely. My grandmother was a well known seamstress at the white house. (drum rolling) Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner. Your prom king and queen for Lancaster High are Michelle Lambert and Butch Yunkin. (crowd cheering) I would just like to say for me and Butch, we are so lucky to have your love and support. We thank every one of you. We love every one of you and we will try to be worthy of this amazing honor. (crowd cheering) (gentle piano music) ♪ It's you that's made me ♪ ♪ All all right ♪ ♪ Contagious melody ♪ You like that one there, don't you? (Butch mumbling) My girlfriend said I can dance with someone I don't know. It's your lucky night. Like he said, it's your lucky night. Okay. I've been seeing you around. You're new, right? Uh huh. What's up with that? Oh, my parents got divorced, so me and my mom moved down here to be near her family. Cool. Cool? Yeah. For me. She's totally his type. She's probably even a virgin. If that where Kenny, forget it. I'd be slitting my wrists. That's the difference. She trusts Butch. No one realizes, Butch is a full-time job. He gets bored easily. I have to keep feeding him pieces of candy. So they're all going over to the pool. We should go, get some bikini shots. Cool. (water splashing) (girls screaming) She is truly awesome. Oh please. In the ninth grade, nobody even knew her name. She had ugly brown hair, she weighed 150 pounds and she definitely did not have Mediterranean sea blue eyes. A cousin sold her the contacts. Nope, she just turned into Barbie, which is, I don't... (water splashing) Whoah. Hey Laurie. Where's your bathing suit? At home. I dare you to jump in, in your underwear. Don't you have to play with your engine or something? Who would you rather play with? Me or her? Do you wanna go back to my house, check out the footage? I guess. I have an extra bathing suit in the van. Do you wanna borrow? Would you mind? No. Whatever, I'm cool. Okay, I'll call you. Okay, cool. Yeah. You know, if you swim every single day, it really helps take off the extra pounds. I mean, not that you have to worry about it. You have such a cute shape. Now when you hit the water, don't make any splash. Okay? Slice it clean, like a knife. Ready? Set. Go! (water splashing) (crowd groaning) Oh, man! (Laurie coughing) (eerie music) Mom? Oh my God. Mom, mom, I had the best time. Hi honey. Okay. Remember, after the first day I told you about this girl who had these incredible blue green eyes? I think so. Well she was voted prom queen and she totally wants to be my friend. She lent me her bathing suit and she invited me over. Oh, and her boyfriend Butch, he's this really sweet guy. And he thinks she's a goddess. And he's really nice to her friends. I think you're a goddess. How was your night? It's fine. You are such a bad liar. You're totally thinking about your prom and dad and falling in love, right? You know what? Oh, no, I'm not gonna tell you this. Oh, it's too late now. Okay. Your dad and I, we left the prom early and fell in love in the back of a 65 Mustang. You know all that. But what you don't know is I wasn't his prom date. Oh my God! No, he went with somebody else. That's the part I always leave out. You should have known what kind of person he was. Yeah, I think you always know. You just don't always pay attention. But what makes me happy is to see you happy, see your pretty little face all lit up. You should have been the prom queen. Next year. (laughing) Yeah. (laughing) (light music) Thanks. Oh, wait. I'll help you with your laundry. No, no, no, no, no. It's cool, my mom's too sick. Oh, okay. I'll be right out. There's turkey tetrazzini in the microwave. Let's get outta here. Honey? Honey, take them with you, please? Hey girls, say hi to Laurie. Hi guys. So if you mix the green in with the yellow, you can make a really nice tree. Just start at the top at the point and then make little short brush strokes all the way down. See where I used to live was all concrete and harsh. Nothing pretty like this. Thanks for letting me do my laundry, Mrs. Show. Hazel. My pleasure. Butch would've fixed the washing machine, but my father is so twisted. And Butch is? Her boyfriend. They're really serious. They've been together forever. Ah, forever. Since the beginning of freshman year, mom. We were like together in a past life. We are so destined. Past lives, this is serious. Yeah. My father hates him though. Really? I mean, he says it's my grades, but, in my humble opinion, I think he just wants me home being cook, babysitter, and general slave. But the kids worship Butch, right guys? When we get married, we're gonna adopt the kids if my mom doesn't feel better. You know, why don't you two go off to a movie or something? We could stay here and maybe make macaroni necklaces? Yeah. Really? Are you sure? But you just got home from work. Yeah, go on. Hazel, you're so cool. Here, you guys wanna use this? This color looks so great on you. So your dad just comes in one day and says "I'm leaving you, deal with it"? Yep. And his girlfriend thinks she can be like a second mom to me. Courtney, ugh. I think you need more eyeshadow. Ugh, I would've killed Courtney. Hold still. Seriously. I would've tortured her and then killed her. My mom's too nice. Yeah, I guess I am too. Except about my Adonis. Now. Blood red is the best red. Even Butch says so. Check it out, you're awesome. Oh! Okay, now kiss me. What? Kiss me. You'll see, the color stays on. What? I'm a lesbian. (laughing) I'm just kidding. I'm not interested in you sexually. Kiss my hands. Okay. Turn around, show Hazel. Absolutely ravishing. A goddess. (pins clacking) Yeah! Yeah, all right, way to go! I did a good job on her, didn't I? Totally incredible. You guys look great. What about her and Pete? This Pete again. Hey Butch, Jen says what about Laurie and Pete? She could do better. Oh. I should go say hi to Sam. Hey. I thought you were gonna call me. I started editing without you. You look totally weird. Yeah. Michelle was fooling around. Anyway, I do wanna see the video. Well, you know my number. Put your hair behind your ear. God, I should have put some spray in it. Say it, what are you thinking? I liked her better before. Ow! Darwin's right, he is a neanderthal. (Butch hooting) Goodnight. And thanks. Aren't you gonna say goodnight to her? You wanna sleep with her. Michelle! You're totally transparent. You're nuts. Have I come on to you? No way. Michelle, he ha- Let's go, Butch. Let's go! Go! Ow, trying to get us killed? (tires screeching) Hi. How was tonight? Fine. It was fine. Okay. (upbeat rock music) Hey, foxy lady. Put your arm around my waist. Pull me closer down. Now, kiss me. Look at him over there. His little pencil's sticking out. (laughing) At least he knows how to use it. I could drown that little moe with one hand. Huh, what? What are you looking at? Need help with that? Excuse me? What are you- What am I doing in the ladies room? I like the lady. It's okay, relax. Here. Let me do that. You just, I don't know. You seem like someone I could talk to, you know? Butch, you guys are really intense. Me? I mean. You see her jerking my chain all over the place? She was really nice, making me up and doing my hair. And then you tell her, I look better than her? It's true though. She wears too much makeup. Even if that was true, which it isn't, I can't hold a candle to her. And girls are sensitive, you know? Yeah, well I tell her guys are guys. They think things, but they don't act- So what are you thinking right now? Michelle? Butch, can you please leave us alone? I was thinking, why don't you tell Craig to come into the lady's room where he belongs? Craig was just saying that you walk like an ape. I never noticed that. Go stick your tongue down his throat then. Well, do you want him, the ape man? No. Michelle, that's not what I- No don't say no yet. I mean it could be a really good thing. For everyone, right Butch? Change is always good. (Michelle giggling) Just got a nice big fat juicy one. Ew! Here you go. You know what you can do? Make one worm, in to two. Hey Michelle, it's gross. Okay, come on. It's time for lunch. I made your favorite, pasta with cream sauce. You're hungry, right? (door knocking) (lightly tense music) Did you kiss him yet? No. Look, it was just a understanding, Michelle. I couldn't care less. He's a good kisser, but he's not a great lover. See what you can do with him, I'm like so bored. I don't want Butch. Anyway, don't jump on me, but I think you still love him. And I'm positive he still loves you. Are you deaf or are you stupid? I don't want Butch. I'm hanging with Craig now. This is crazy. You call it crazy, I call it real life. There's no hard feelings. Seriously. There's nothing going on. Okay, how about this one? Okay. I don't know, honey. It sounds to me like her pride is hurt. Honestly, she seems slightly immature. No, I don't like that one. I mean, doesn't it sound immature to you to suddenly say she's bored a day after saying they're destined? She's insecure, mom, like everyone else. I think that looks great by the way. No. Nope, don't like that one. Well, you see, my point is if I were you, Which you are not. Well, you might wanna try to help them reconcile. They seem happier together and less inclined to play their silly games. Yeah, well, I don't even know if we're still talking. Cool. No, it's too sexy for a blind date. So the wrong attitude, mom. I still wish I could just stay home and make chocolate chip cookies with you. He's gonna love you. Here, blood red, the best. I don't think so. ( phone ringing) Oh, please be Michelle. Hello? Are you okay? I understand. No, listen to me, you are not going to kill yourself. Okay. Where are you? Look, maybe you should come over here. Okay. Okay, I'll see you soon, bye. You look really awful. I want to just, make her bleed, man! I'm nothing without Chelle. Nothing, man. I don't even exist without her. You have no idea how deep we go. I think I do. I believe she's just really insecure so she gets mad. I know this is temporary between you two. (oven ringing) Hey, you know, I read you should always eat chocolate when you're feeling lonely. I'm not kidding, something about the way it affects the brain. She won't eat sugar. She's a fanatic. Hope I didn't overcook them. I'm gonna say one last thing, then I won't say another word about her. No, you don't have to censor yourself. Craig Haber? I mean, that moron? I bet he takes steroids. And if that's who she wants, then- She doesn't want Craig. She wants you. You two are destined, she told me. Here. Eat it hot. All mushy inside, that's the best. Oh. You're really special, you know that? (Butch and Laurie giggling) Lover boy has a bed in the van. Maybe he goes camping a lot. Maybe I'm just being the overprotective uncle, sis, but I don't know. They're swimming. It's 110 today. Am I missing something here? I got to tell you something, Haze, you're not gonna like it. Oh gee, what else is new? I was his age and I know why he has a bed in his van and it's not about the great outdoors. (water splashing) Come on Jake, they're kids. Just give them a break. Girl, guy, bed, van? Please. (Laurie giggling) (water splashing) Oh, no, no!

Not spying. My back was burning, okay? End of story. Honey, I think he's trying to make her jealous. No he isn't. He thinks I'm easy to talk to. You don't even know him that well. Well, he told me last night. Last night, last night when? He dropped over while you were on your date. Hey, how was that by the way? Why didn't you tell me? I didn't have a chance. Mom, he was through threatening suicide over her. I couldn't just brush him off. Well, he certainly didn't look suicidal today. Some people would consider that a good thing. All right, honey. I don't know, I just get this feeling that I don't think that you should be alone with him. Just because you don't trust men, I can't have a social life? He's not dad and I'm not Courtney. Well I sure as hell hope that kid is not your only option for a social life, Laurie. Sam! You got 10 seconds. Psycho boss is on my case big time. Look, I'm sorry I've been kind of flaky. I didn't mean to be, I just, I got carried away. You wanna hang out later? You can sleep over. Sure. Hey. Hey. Sorry about the crowd, they're my brother's friends. Here. I made you a copy. Thanks. I think we got some good shots. Is everyone there? Yeah. Well, everyone except the love birds. (light rock music) Hey, why don't you go rustle us up some snacks there. Keep dreaming, Danny. Hey. Hey. This is Laurie. Laurie, this is my dad. Hey, good to meet you, Laurie. Hey, nice to meet you too. He rented the Godfather trilogy. We can go upstairs and watch it with him. Hurry on up. My mom would be hovering downstairs all night. Booze and retards in there. I thought he wasn't coming. What's up with you? Nothing. The Humpty Dumpty nightlight in my bathroom has more wattage than that idiot. I don't know, he just seems more like a lost puppy. Are you kidding? He's a mutant. Not to me, okay, Sam? Hey, Sam, disappear. In case you didn't notice, this is my kitchen. So where's Michelle? I need to talk to you. Come on Laurie, it's showtime. Yeah, I'll be right up. Hey. Hey. What's up? Nothing. So. Like, come inside. I'm watching Godfather. Don't. How come? Because. Because why? Cause don't give me such a hard time. I'm not giving you anything. It's just... What? Hey, it's Butch. Leave it at the tone, I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Butchie. Butchie, honey, pick up the phone. I really need to talk to you. Butchie, please pick up the phone. Where are you?! ♪ Took you astray ♪ You're a virgin, aren't you? That's what I love about you. You're so pure. Give me your cell phone. Thanks for telling me, Jennifer.

Leave a message after the beep. I know where you are, do you hear me? I know where you are! (tense music) Hey, Chelle. Come on, I need you to drive me somewhere. Okay, but, can I ask you something? What, this is important. Can I go to the pool with you sometime? If I drive? Just get the keys, okay? Come on, let's go. Okay. This week, I promise, okay? So just get the keys, all right? Hurry up. Don't be scared. I'm not. You okay? Come here. I dreamt about you every night this week. Butch. Take off your shirt. Butch. Are you really over Michelle? Don't mention her name. This is gonna be really special. Don't worry. Can you just, please slow down? Butch! Can we just talk? Like about what? I don't know. Now I feel stupid. Butch? You just need some encouragement. No, I don't don't think so. You can be a pain in the ass, you know that? Oh yeah. (groaning) (Butch moaning) Oh god! I'm sorry I had to get a little rough. You just needed some friendly persuasion. You were on the fence. He did the same thing to me the first time. Oh, man! I hate you! Ugh! Guess what? I'm having his baby! Did you hear that, daddy? Say something, Laurie! What's going on? You've completely misunderstood, Michelle. He loves you, Michelle! I am so blind! He was mine goddamit, and he's the father of my baby! (Laurie sobbing) (ominous music) (car starting) You're a hundred percent sure? How do I know it's not Craig's? You could have been sleeping with him this whole time. How do I know? Because I said so. How could you even ask me that? I never slept with Craig. I hate you so much! Hey, it wasn't anything. You know that. You know how I am. I always come back to you. I can't live without you. Yeah. You're so helpless. That's why you got it for your self, right? I know. She doesn't know what you like though. No way. She's a virgin, man. Yeah? Yeah. You like that? Hey, I'm sorry, Chelle. Come on, Chelle. Come on. Want me to show you some of Craig's moves? He's got moves too, you know? You're such a witch, you know that. Oh, come on, I'm teasing. You know you're the only one I want. Yeah. Can you show me how sorry you are? Show me how sorry you really are. We have to get serious now. No more games. We're gonna be a family. We'll get a place and it'll be all nice, and the baby will be so cute, and my sisters will come live at us. (Laurie sobbing) Laurie, what happened at Samantha's party? Pick up, you coward. Did you ask her, Hazel? I'm carrying his baby. Do you even care? I would never do what you did, but if I did, I wouldn't run away crying, like I was the injured party. I'm the injured party! I'm the injured party! I couldn't tell you. I tried to tell him. I don't know. I think... I think he raped me. I know what you think, it's all my fault. Please, just don't say anything, okay? Oh my God. No, Laurie, this is not your fault. You always make excuses for me. You tried to warn me! I never imagined that he would rape you. I so messed up. No, shh. No honey, you can't blame yourself. Do you wanna talk to me about this? No. Okay, then there are people that you can talk to that can help you. No, I just wanna forget about it. Laurie, we do have to report this. What, tell the cops? Honey, he did something terrible to you. He can't get away with this. Did you hear me? You report this and I am totally dead. Everyone hates me enough as it is. Can you just leave me alone, okay? I wanna go to sleep. Okay. Butch's van is outside. Oh my God. I'm calling the cops. No. Laurie, you're not going out there. Mom, I can handle this. Laurie. He lifts a finger, I am gonna rip his face off. Please, Mom. Stay where you are. Where's Michelle? I took her home. Did you hear me? Listen. She could still change her mind about the baby. You never know with Michelle. Is that what you came to say? That it'll be over, and then we can hang. Just might take a little time. Are you joking? Huh? You must be joking. Tell me you're joking. You really are a mutant. What? It's serious, her pregnancy. I can't just walk away. Get out of here. Go. Now! You have to become a manipulator. You compliment something that they have on and then they trust you. Even if you don't mean it? Hello? Sales is a manipulation in case you haven't heard. Right, right, I'm just oversensitive to manipulation. Don't mind me. Come on. I'll show you how to ring up the sale. Okay. I got the job at Le Roux. I've sworn off men. Life is full of promise. Wanna do a movie tonight? Let's talk later. Okay. Call me when you get off. How can you let her manipulate you like that? Is there a problem with your shoes? Are you in love with her? What? I mean, Sam, I don't care. I'm not that type of person, but she's been telling everyone that you're a lesbian. But I don't judge anyone, really, I'm not that type of person, but I just can't believe someone with your obvious intelligence would allow themselves to be jerked around like that. I mean you're yearbook editor. Did you know I'm pregnant? Butch's baby. Did she really tell you? She definitely used the word. So how come you never hang out with us anyway? Because you're Danny's friends. You know, I was just telling Jennifer the other day, how I thought you were probably a much cooler person than Danny. Well, yeah, well, it wouldn't be hard to be cooler than my brother. I've been dying to play with your hair. You've got great hair. I'll get the popcorn, you get the seats? Okay here's some money. Thanks. Hey, what's up? I called you. Sam, what did you do to your hair? Come on Sam. Butch is saving our seats. (lightly tense music) (phone ringing) Hello? Somebody should ruin your life, teach you a lesson. You're a betraying evil person. (phone ringing) Hi, this is the Show residence. Please leave a message at the beep. (beeping) How dare you hang up on me. I am gonna make sure that you never get one wink of sleep for the rest of your life. You ruin my life, I'm gonna ruin your life. And you know what, I'll enjoy it. Did you tell them what Laurie said about the baby? She just laughed, said she didn't care. You know, she could ruin every one of our lives. I don't know, it's affecting the baby too, her vibes. Seriously, she should die. What are we doing, killing Laurie Show? Anyone get a beer for me? Thank you. Give her a big bunch of brownies with a tiny bit of arsenic. They can't tell when it's low. How would you kill her, Sam? I don't know. What do you feel sorry for her, lesbian lover? What about the old classic? Put the body in a tub full of hydrochLauriec acid. Pretty soon, nobody, not even the bones man. (laughing) No, no, no. Guys, guys, tie a stone around her and throw her in the river. Laurie Show sleeps with the fishes. Don't you kids have anything better to do on a Saturday night? Don't you? (laughing) I'd just get a butcher knife and slit her throat. Clean, quick, and humane. (doorbell ringing) Hi, I'm officer Randolph, this is officer Webster. Are you the one that's been getting the phone calls? Did my mom call you? Thanks for coming, I'm Laurie's mom, Hazel. I can't believe you did this. I know honey. I know this is scary, but we talked- Mom, you went behind my back. Look. Why don't you tell us what's been going on? We're here to help you. Please come in. Now my dad's kicked me out, Butch and I have to live in a trailer. And it's all your fault! I don't even know what she's talking about. I'll probably have to drop out of school, because of you, you whore. Do you lie awake at night imagining Courtney making love to your husband, Hazel? Doesn't it just eat away at your brain? There's some parents who would kick out a piece of trash like her, but you? Oh no, you just pretend you can't see what's right in front of your face. Does she make a threat anywhere on this tape? No, only when she's got me on the phone. So what can you do, tell her it's against the law to call here? It's a free country. Honey, let them do their job. Your daughter's right, Miss Show. Unless we can prove the Lambert girl's making threats. If you like, we can call her, maybe scare a bit. Nothing scares her. Don't call her. You might wanna consider changing your number. No, it'll just make her madder. Look, you kids are playing a high stakes game, trading partners every weekend. I mean things like this are bound to happen. Hey, Pete, easy. Somebody's gotta say it. Everybody's scared of their kids these days. I am not afraid of my daughter. And you have no idea what really happened. Mom? Why don't you tell us what really happened? Don't answer him. Well, thank you for coming. We'll call you if we need you. Call me. That little bitch. She called the cops. (electronic dance music) These need to be put back on the rack. Sure. Thanks. Excuse me. Go away. You can't keep doing this, it's my job. Is shopping for my mother's birthday against the law? I don't know, did I miss something? Just go away! What's the problem, Laurie? I'll tell you what the problem is. Ever since she slept with the father of my baby, she's been so guilty that she can't stand the sight of me. Please get out of here, Michelle. Don't do this. I'm so sorry. Maybe I should just stay home all summer so you don't feel guilty. Finish up the conversation, girls. You and I will talk later. You called the cops. My mother did. Oh, Laurie. Mr. Gardner found these in his barn. Do they look familiar? Give me those! (screaming) The baby, oh! The baby! You're insane! I made a mistake! Laurie! I paid! Stop torturing me! Do something! Stop making up lies! You hear me? No, chicks, man. They scare the hell out of me. Don't hurt her, Chelle. I'm calling the police. I'll forget everything if you just stop harassing us. He does not love you, okay? So just get over it and move on. You are just... You know, I really cared about you, that's the sad part. Come on Butch. We'll go to Burlington's for mom's present. You okay, Chelle? I think she hurt the baby. You go over to Michelle's house and I'll go live with dad, I swear. You've already caused enough trouble calling the cops. Okay, Laurie. Uncle Jake and I had a little talk. He's been worried too. He thinks that- You told uncle Jake? About Butch and everything? He's family, we need help. You're the one who can't handle things. That's why dad dumped you. Enough, Laurie. Trying to hurt my feelings is not gonna solve any of this. I'm not the enemy. From now on, you're on a need to know basis. Deal with it. (doorbell ringing) I'll get it. Look, just let me in, okay? I'm being watched. What? I'm being watched, it's Michelle, over there. (tense music) Look, I'm supposed to tell you that I'm going to this party and there's this guy who saw you at the pool who wants to meet you. Laurie? It's nothing, mom. But it's a lie. So we can lure you out and hook you up with Michelle and the rest. And they're gonna tie you up and they're gonna put you in Butch's van. Oh my God. Where they're gonna spray you with black paint and cut off your hair. That's what she was talking about, killing you. I think she's gone crazy. Oh, hi, Sam. Honey, come finish dinner. Sam, you can come and join us. We're not talking about anything you need to know. I just came over to say hi. Okay. Close your blinds and lock your doors. Why'd you warn me? Did you tell her that... What? Never mind. She's a witch, and by the time you figure it out, you're in too deep. So save yourself. Thank you. (tense music) All set, yeah. I hate walking in late. (bell tolling) (church organ music) Do you have an extra hymnal? Thank you. Coffee? No thank you. I think maybe I'll have waffles. Thank you. Just order me some oatmeal, okay? (suspenseful music) That's great, man. Yeah. You must be looking forward to it. Yeah, yeah. You'll be playing any ball for 'em? Hopefully if I make the team, I don't know. Laurie. This is my old business partner Jim Patterson, his nephew, Andrew. Andrew's gonna be around all summer and I was just telling him, maybe he should give you a call and the two of you can get together, see a movie or something. Yeah, sure. Sure, yeah. I'll give you a call. Great, great. All right, great to see you, Jim. Yeah. Take care. Nice meeting you. What? He goes to Hodgkins, Laurie. I mean, I thought it'd be a nice change with some of the losers you've been hanging around with lately. Here you go. Great, thanks. Thank you. Yes? Yeah. Really? Yeah. So this is the second time you've been set up? Yeah, it's going a little bit than the first time though. So far. Thank you, I'm glad. Sometimes these action movies all seem the same, you know? Yeah, like you don't even remember it an hour later? What's the matter? Sorry, I thought I... Never mind. Ah. I left my glasses in the men's room. Oh. Meet me at the car, okay? Can I have the keys? Yeah. Thanks. (girl giggling) (tense music) Hey! Aw, did he dump you too? Too fat and ugly for him? Scream and it'll get rough! Grab her, Paula! Get her! Grab her down! We were just gonna scare her, you said you wouldn't- Get away! Just get out of our way! (hits bashing) (Michelle screaming) Tell Hazel I wish I could do the same thing to her. I feel so much better now. I really needed to do that. I refuse to be a victim. Oh God, don't let her be dead. Please don't let her be dead. One word out of you, lesbian freak, and you'll be dead. Believe me. Tell the police and I'll kill you. She'll be fine. Let's go. Let's go! I'm not afraid to kill every one of you. (laughing) (Laurie coughing) (cars starting) God, Laurie, Laurie! Help! Somebody help! She manipulates me into being her friend, and then she sleeps with my boyfriend, follows me to restaurants, attacks me in public, tries to hurt my baby, and now this? I never touched her. So you were nowhere near the east town mall? I told you where I was. I was at the water tower and then the Burger Palace. I really need to go home. I'm pregnant and I'm so tired. I wouldn't be your age again for a million bucks. Especially a girl like you. You know, somebody with some brains. Most of those others, don't seem like they got much going on upstairs. (laughing) You and Laurie were buddies, right? Doesn't it bother you? Wouldn't you, wouldn't you hope somebody would come forward if it were you lying out there? Sweetheart, did she threaten you? We were at the water tower then we went to the Burger Palace. Hi, Christine? It's Laurie. Yeah, I had kind of an accident and I won't be coming into work anymore. Uh huh. Okay, you too, bye. Here you go, honey. She didn't seem too disappointed. This whole town sees me as a problem. Well to hell with what they think. Andrew was nice too. He disappeared quick as a shooting star, huh, Mom? What? I haven't protected you. What could you have done? I don't know. That's what I ask myself, what would another mother do? One with some guts or at least a clue. No mom. Oh God, now you're doing the same thing you told me not to do. Don't blame yourself. Honey, I've been thinking that maybe you should... What? Maybe you should go stay with your dad for a little while. No way. You know how much I hate the idea. No way am I leaving you. Never. You're a great mom. The best. You've done everything right. Even calling the cops. Okay. I tell you one thing, if you do stay, you are not going anywhere alone again. Even when school starts next month. ♪ She proceeds to enter ♪ ♪ The conscious mind of me ♪ ♪ Extracts my thoughts from ♪ ♪ The original object of affection ♪ ♪ Yeah although we should be interesting ♪ ♪ Possibly stimulating ♪ My color is terrible. Maybe the baby's taking too much of my blood. I won't be home until 10 or so. Take me to work with you. Just stay here and fix the place up a little. It's a mess. You're not really working a double shift, are you? You just wanna meet up with Laurie Show. Would you shut up? I'm killing myself to pay for us to live in this pigsty here. The least you can do is clean it up a little bit. That's the way you guys are. You're all just lying creeps in the end. You like to rattle my cage, don't you? You got the baby, you got me. And just shut up about Laurie Show. You want me to move back in with my parents, right? So you can sleep with Laurie Show right here in this bed, right?! Laurie Show, Laurie Show, Laurie Show! (Michelle screaming) ♪ Somehow I feel she's testing me ♪ Either Jake or I will be here at three. I hate this. Well, get over it, honey. Laurie. I- Hi. (bell ringing) Hi Mandy. (Michelle groaning) (groaning) No! Hey, you guys come here. Hey, I've gotta talk to you. Find someone else, Michelle. Are you okay? Yeah, just out shopping for the baby. Butch and I are having troubles. You know, Laura Show again. Sorry. Come on, Paula. Did you hear that? She's lost it. Hey Tabby! Hey, I've been waiting for you. Wow. How's it going? You look so messed up. I lost the baby. No. It's gotten so heavy, Tab. That bitch, her vibe's killed my baby. I need help, Tab. No one else has your guts. Whatever. Wherever, Chelle, I'm there. That was a really good game. The ref totally blew it. I know. Anyway I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Bye. One of these days, when you least expect it. I saw your painting, Laurie. It's hard to bear seeing you live in this kind of fear. How did this happen? I don't think you've faced it yet. This is beyond our control. But this was supposed to be a better place. You needed to believe that. That's what got you through the divorce. But the truth is really bad stuff happens everywhere. It's hard for you to accept that. Maybe you should start thinking about what life's gonna be like when I'm gone. Laurie, I don't want to hear you talk that way. I'm sorry. I just know that no matter what anyone does, she's gonna find a way to kill me. No, there has got to be something. I don't accept this. There has got to be some kind of law. Have a seat. We have no laws against something like this, unless your a relative, husband, or live in lover. Even then, and even if you prove it, it's just that gray area. What about the assault charge? Did you talk to her boss at Le Roux? She describes it as a cat fight between the two girls. She says, Laurie attacked her first. What are we supposed to do? My daughter truly believes that she is going to die. We can't live like this. There's no relief. Michelle is stalking her, threatening her. They beat her up in a parking lot! What's next? Look at this house coat my daughter dropped by from me on my birthday. That's the kind of girl she is. Ms. Lambert, we got a real problem here. And maybe with your influence, did you know we were looking into assault charges? I should go back inside now. Did she tell you? No, our lives are being ruined! I wouldn't do that. I'm gonna have to send my daughter away to live with her father! As a mother, you must understand that! Assault charges. That bitch. Dammit, Buster, come here! There you are, ugh! Bad, bad Buster. He's so cute. Butch gave him to me. He thought it would make me feel better about the baby. Can I hold him? The other thing is they're sending Laurie away to live with her father. Why did't you tell me that first? Thought you'd be happy. Nothing makes me happy. I won't be happy until she's paid for the pain and the suffering she caused me and my baby. So then what's the plan? We've gotta get the big bitch out of the house first. And then how long do you think it'll take once we're inside? Like 15 minutes, right? Ow! He bit me! Give him back, you idiot. 15 minutes. You think? I will put her on the plane. Can you be there to pick her up? What, I've already told you all of this, John, are you just not listening to me? The cops are doing everything that they can. It's the laws. They have no control over sick people. (sighing) Great. Fine, bye. We should get someone to fax you your assignments. Oh, honey. You don't have to guts to slit someone's throat. We also need rope. These good? They're red, you idiot, we need black. What's so funny? Just picturing you two dressed up like ninjas. And we're gonna need garbage bags. Tomorrow you'll be kissing my feet. That was the hospital calling saying that Mary is out sick and there's like three surgeries this morning, so can I come in like right now? Oh no. Honey, it didn't sound like I have a choice. So I'll call a taxi. (tense music) Be home after glee club. Did you make the call? Cool. Did you? Uh huh. So cool. Whoa, girl. This is hard. Okay, go mom. Don't get fired on top of everything else. Okay. Laurie, you're gonna call me as soon as you get there. I love you mom. Oh, honey. I love you. Okay, I've gotta go. Big bitch is out of the house. Be back here at 7:15. Everything I do, I do for you and me, our friends and our families. (tense music) (doorbell ringing) Coming. Oh, oh my god, help! No, no, no! No! (Laurie screaming) Did you think you can get away from me? You didn't call and say you needed me for an emergency bypass? Why would I do that? Mary's on call. Oh God, no. Oh dear God, no. Coffee's not even ready. I can wait. (suspenseful music) (car honking) No! No! From the beginning again. You guys picked me up at 6:30 so we could go out to K-Mart and I could buy my mother a birthday present. Lick my thumb. And Butch, Butch dropped us off. He went to Pennsylvania Dutch for breakfast. Concentrate. You have to be able to say this under duress, Tabby. Okay. So it wasn't open. So Butch came back to get us and we went out towards Old Philadelphia but you said, you forgot your purse so we went back. You can't even do two things at once. I can do four or five. And while Butch was fixing the tire, you and me had something to eat. Chelle? We had something to eat. And then these two Spanish girls insulted you. And I said, "Hey, that's my friend." And I shoved one of them, and the other one scratched me across the face. Now dry off and get dressed.

(phone ringing) I need to speak to officer Randolph. ♪ Amazing grace ♪ ♪ How sweet the sound ♪ ♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪ ♪ I once was lost ♪ ♪ But now I'm found ♪ ♪ Was blind ♪ ♪ But now I see ♪ I wish there were more like you. No, you don't. I loved her. I trusted her. She seemed like the most unusual and special person, like sunshine. We shared the most intimate facts about ourselves. And within two weeks she had slept with my boyfriend, and then began obsessing about him, the man whose child I was carrying. So we were just gonna talk to her. And if she didn't apologize, we were gonna tie her up. Tie her up! Do you hear me, she's gonna hurt the baby, tie her up! I thought you lost the baby. Tie her up now! Maybe cut her hair. A prank. That's what I thought. And that's when I saw the knife. (Laurie screaming) Tabby pulled it from behind her back. And Laurie had her hands up. (Laurie grunting) And I kept shouting "Stop it, Tabby. Put the knife away, Tabby." She looks so messed up. Help me. Well, she needs to be put out her misery. And Laurie... Laurie was saying, "Please don't leave me here. Take me with you." So I began pulling her towards the door. And Tabby was saying, "You're not going anywhere. We're gonna stay and finish her off." Why isn't she dead yet? Yes I did say I wish she would die. And I felt it too. But I just need to say that I am so sorry for my role in Laurie's death. If I thought anything like that would've happened that day, I never would've gotten out of bed. As God as my witness, I am not the one who murdered her. (thunder rumbling) I never knew that people could be so evil. I mean, weren't we taught that people were basically good? She lied so perfectly so easily. Gosh, she's evil. You don't think anyone would ever believe her, do you? I asked the DA the same question today. What did he say? He's worried. I didn't want to tell you. You didn't wanna tell me what? What he said is if they believe Michelle, we can't convict. We've got no witness. But Laurie told me. You weren't a witness to the murder, Haze. Oh my God. So now I'm the liar? You believe me, don't you, Jake? It was never a question. But it's the jury we have to worry about. She's a brilliant actress and there's no one who can change their minds except you. And then I looked over and Laurie was there lying on the floor. Her hands were still moving and there was blood all around her. And so I stepped into the room and I went over to her side and I knelt down beside her. And I saw that she had a rope around her neck, and I put my fingers under the rope to cut it, and, she moaned and she let out this little breath. And that's when I saw that her throat was cut. (sobbing) And so I just, I cradled her and I tried to keep her together. (sobbing) Sorry. And then I asked her "Who did this?" And she said, "Michelle did it." And I told her I loved her and that God would take care of her. I love you! (sobbing) Has the jury reached a verdict? We have, your honor. Will the defendant please rise. Please read the verdict. We find the defendant, Michelle Lambert, guilty of murder in the first degree. Sentencing will be on Monday at 9:00 AM. This court is adjourned. (light music) (gentle guitar music)
