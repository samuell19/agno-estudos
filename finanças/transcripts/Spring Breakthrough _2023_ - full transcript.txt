Be the reason the clouds never come again. We gon' rise and shine. Come on. Move the rain and let the sun come out again. Come on. Hey. See you later. You guys came. Hi, everybody. I'm OK. I'm OK. I'll see you later. Keep you down now. Hold your head up high. Hey, boss. How was your weekend? Cold. I'd give anything to be anywhere other than Chicago right now. Oh, come on. You know you love the windy city. You're right. Are you ready to present to the new board members? I stay ready. Uh? Yes. Phil, look how far we've come, from an office with no heat, to this. We owe it all to you, Monica. Let's not keep the board members waiting. Hot chocolate on you after the meeting. I think it's on you this time. Oh, really? Yeah, because I did the last one. Now that we've welcomed our new board members, I'll turn it over to our senior VP of development, Monica Rollins. Thank you, Phil. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. So as you know, this is the 20th anniversary of our Dig Deep and Donate fundraiser. Let's give that a hand. Yes, so the banquet will once again be held at the Drake Hotel. We've booked an incredible jazz band. And I've already sourced out contributions for our silent auction. And... Kelly. Have you considered creating an app for donations? Well, that is a great idea, but our donor base is old fashioned. And they want to see facts, figures, and tax receipts. So I'm afraid something like that would scare them off. Of course, but we could use it to upload solicitation videos. Since we're raising money for teens, why not put them at the forefront of the campaign? Well, again, I love your enthusiasm, Kelly, but we already have testimonials on the website. And besides, a lot of our kids don't have access to smartphones so... How is the website redesign going? Almost done. Did you have a chance to go over my email? I'm happy to help. No, I did. And some of the content was a bit, well, click baity. And so I decided to replace that with budget breakdowns instead, OK? So back to the silent auction. Lester is out with one of his friends from work. And LJ is at a sleepover, which means you and I have a little girl time and can plan your celebration. What are we celebrating? Your 20th work anniversary. Can I hear it again? Your 20th work anniversary. And I hope they gave you something in a little blue box to celebrate all your years of dedicated service. I don't need all that, but I will get something nice for Phil when he retires and hands the reins over to me. I feel you, boss lady. No, no. I know what you talking about. No, I just want to finish what we started. This work is important to me. I know. And it means a lot, which is why I'm taking you out for a fancy dinner, non-negotiable. OK, do I get to pick the restaurant? Please. Pretty please. Sure, sure. OK. But don't get too crazy because I'm a lowly graphic designer and not a big shot like you. First of all, you are a big shot to. Me how about that? Second of all, yes, I will go. Next week when Vivian gets home from school. Girl, she's a senior. A senior in college, girl. Next stop, law school. Oh, I got the week planned already. So mani-pedis at Paddy's, tea at the Hancock, and the Taye Diggs marathon. Oh, at least some part of you knows how to appreciate a fine man. Oh, that was shade. All right, all right. I do appreciate him though. Hey. Do we need to go over the final guest list? What's wrong? Oh, please don't tell me there's a problem with the donor. Oh, no. Oh, good. That's good. I don't know how to say this. Just say it, Phil. You can tell me anything. We're letting you go. Except that. Monica, I... Well, wow. What, why? The new board met after the presentation. They want to take the foundation in a new direction. OK, we'll have them draw me in there and point me there. You know I'm a fast learner. Unfortunately not fast enough for the board. They see you as part of the old guard. Oh. They want a fresh perspective. Young. Yeah, just see it, young perspective. I tried to change their minds, but I was the lone voice in the wilderness. I'm so sorry, Monica. I'll write you an amazing letter of recommendation. With your experience, you'll find something in no time. Oh, well, baby girl, your mom is in a real fix. I finished my last midterm this morning. I'm free. I'm so jealous. I still got to write my paper on... Babe. What are you doing? We have class. Vivian, you bring so much light to my life. I love you so much. I'd be honored if you'd be my wife, please. Shawn. I'm sorry. I didn't get a ring yet. I don't care about any of that. Is that a yes? Yes, yes, yes. You just made me the happiest man alive. You just asked me to marry you. I'm so stoked. My parents are about to meet you finally. Yeah, me too. I actually cannot wait to meet them. Are you going to tell your dad? It's not my dad I'm worried about. What's the big emergency? Well, I didn't get the little blue box. I got the big brown one. I got fired. And they are replacing me with a new model named Kelly. But I have spent half my adult life with this foundation, what am I going to do? You going to do like you always do. You're going to stay strong and face the challenge head on. But first, you're coming with me. No, I can't. I'm waiting for Vivian's call. How do you think she's going to take the news? I don't know. I'm not going to tell her, not until I have a game plan. I don't want to distract her. You know what they say. When one door closes, another one opens. And in the meantime, enjoy the break. See my baby's face will cheer me up. Oh, it's the phone. Hey, baby girl. Look at you. You're glowing. How were your midterms? Good, I haven't gotten grades back yet, but I'm pretty sure your girl aced them. Of course you aced them. And you're going to ace your interviews. And you will have your pick of every Fortune 500 company. Well... So when does your plane land on Saturday? I have the whole week mapped out. Right, I think there might just be a slight change in plans. OK. I have news, good news, I think. Oh, what's up, Vivian? Spill the tea. OK, right, I'm just going to spit it out. Here it goes. I'm engaged. Congratulations, honey. Thank you, Aunt Denise. Oh, come on, show us the ring. Oh, so I don't have a ring yet. OK, god, I thought you were serious. I was worried. Oh, I am serious. He asked me to marry him and I accepted. I really don't think I need a ring. Our love is all I need. Well, I think that's beautiful. Thank you, Aunt Denise. So hold on. You're serious. So does this person have a name? His name is Shawn. Mommy, he's great. Well, honey, I'm sure he's great, but if he was so serious, where's your ring? Well, I told him I only want one ring to grace my finger forever. So he's saving up to buy my dream ring. Oh, I think that's beautiful. So this Shawn, is he the reason for the sudden change in plans? Well, sort of. So his parents are really excited. And they want to celebrate our engagement. They want to take all of us to the Gulf Coast. All of us? Yeah, so me and you and Sierra is going to come too. Wait, if your bestie is coming, then I'm coming too. We are not going to the Gulf Coast with a bunch of strangers, Denise. Mom, they're not strangers. These are my future in-laws, our future family. Shawn's mom works for an airline. His dad has the hookup at the Grand Hotel Resort and Spa. It's the best resort on the Gulf Coast. I really think you'll like it. Denise can you tell me the last time my mom has been on a vacation? Exactly, she'll be there. I'll be there, right, Monica? Say congratulations. Congratulations, honey. Thanks, mom. I'll talk to you later. Oh. Well, how did it go? She was calm, but it was like she was... She was too calm. Hey, take the win. Listen, she'll love the Gulf Coast. She'll love my family. And hopefully she'll love me too. You're right, because like how could she not? How could she not? Hey, Denise. Here we are. I've been blindsided twice in one week. I don't know what Vivian is thinking. I married young, thinking I'd still have time to pursue a career then I got pregnant. Vivian's not pregnant, Monica. Well, it could happen. And then what? And I know Viv. She'd give up everything to be a good mom. And that's a bad thing? No, it's a good thing at the right time. I just don't want her rushing into all this like I did. I'm going to change her mind. Please don't say you have one of your kidnapping schemes concocted. OK, I'm not talking about one of you soap operas, Denise. I'm going to talk some sense into her. And by the end of this trip, the engagement will be over. I can promise you that. It sure sounds like one of my soap operas. I forgot my book. You know what? I'm going to get something for the flight. You want anything? Watch my stuff. OK. Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't know you were there. What are you in the market for? In terms of books. Oh, well, I've been meaning to check this one out. I love the author's last book on the public university system. OK, so that's to dry, right? No, no, not to dry at all. I've actually read it. You read it? Yes, I have. OK. It's very informative. Informative? Yeah. All right. But based on your sunscreen there, I'm imagining you're heading someplace tropical. Don't you want something frothier, or a beach escape, something like that. I mean, that's not exactly a beach read. Oh, not exactly a beach girl, sitting around, doing nothing, getting sand in places sand should not could. You know you could be a travel writer with sentiments like that. Future bride? Oh gosh, no. Been there, done that, not going back. My daughter just got engaged. Your daughter? Yep. Surely, you mean your sister. There is no way you have a daughter old enough to be getting married. Do you use that entire line on every random stranger that walks into the airport? No. I have and I reserve it for the prettiest ones with an interest in Keynesian economics. Wow. You just threw that in there, uh? I'm impressed. So mysterious mother of the bride, are you excited about this wedding, or? Well, my only child has decided to throw away her life before she graduates college, every mother's dream. And I am sorry. I do not know why I overshared. I do not do that. I don't know why I just said that. I'm sorry. It's OK. I have that effect on women. I got to go. Bye. Changed your mind. No, I did not change my mind. They have some beautiful dresses in here for graduation. Ow. Excuse me. I think you forgot this. I didn't buy that. I know. They were two for one. Oh. Who is that? Nobody. He's a fellow traveler. I guess you got caught up with nobody and forgot to buy your book. Shut up, Denise, shut up. Hey, looks like Mr. Nobody is on our flight. Dare I say destiny is calling. It's not destiny. Gosh. Another man child who doesn't want to grow up. No, thank you. I think he looks like fun. Well, I don't have time for fun. I'm on a mission. [JANOS FULOP, THEO ROSENTHAL, KAECI COOPER, ["LIVE THIS MOMENT"] There's a time for everything, for everything. And there's a time for many things. But I know Look at this place. It's beautiful. Yep, Beautiful. Mom. Hey, baby... slow down, slow down. Hi, honey. Hi. Oh, I bought you some sunscreen because you always forget. Hi. Hey, sweetheart. Where's this fiance of yours? He's at the pool with his family. He'll be around in a second. You hear that, Monica? Shawn's family is enjoying their vacation. Oh, my gosh. We're going to have a great time. Yeah. Why don't we all say that together. We're going to have a great time. We're going to have a fun. This is a nice resort. Yes, mom, I told you. Isn't this great? I know this is happening fast, but I'm so happy you're both here. How fast are we talking, honey? How long have you known this boy? We met last semester. He's a business major. That sounds promising. Last semester? And I'm just hearing of him. There will be plenty of time for you to get to know him, mom. We haven't even set a date yet. No? No. Sun, honey. Oh, the wind. Mom, there is no life changing decision that I would make without consulting you. You know that? Except for the whole engagement thing. Viv Hi? Ready to meet my mom? Yeah, sure. Nice, very subtle. Like nuance is your specialty. Mom, Denise, this is Shawn, my... Wow, my fiance. I'm so not used to saying that. Oh, Miss Rollins, that would be good. Right. You can call me Denise. Denise, nice to meet you, Denise. I want you both to know that I am so honored that Vivian said yes. I know I'm pushing way above my weight here. Well, I think very highly of her. And she is my greatest achievement. And I just love her so much, so much. So Shawn, what are your plans after graduation? Well, I... I mean do you have a job lined up? Yes. What is your primary area of focus? Actually... Wow, mom. Actually, I got your keys. Why don't you guys get settled and we will see you a little later. Yes, yes. We'll let you settle in. And we have dinner reservations at 7:00. And I'm so excited for you to meet my parents. It was nice to meet you, Shawn. Nice to meet you. I'm so sorry. It's OK. Well, I can't wait to meet the folks who raised him. Keys. Gosh. My feet hurt. I got to come up off of these shoes. You can take them off at the table. Well, I can't be nice if my feet hurt. Don't be nice, be kind. There's a difference. What's that supposed to me? I am kind. Oh. Mom, Aunt Denise, meet the Norwoods. I'm Joy. And this is my husband, Forrest. It is such a pleasure to meet Vivian's family. Vivian is a lovely girl. It's easy to see why Shawn is so enamored with her. Oh, you're very kind. And this is my big brother, Tyson. What's up? Miss Rollins, your girl is going to be a maid of honor. Cool, right? The coolest. I'm just counting on you to keep the girl out of trouble. Vivian's the one who usually keeps me out of trouble. At this age, you both should be living it up. Forrest has a fraternity brother that's the golf pro here. His sister is the director of food and beverage. And Shawn's godfather. He's killing the godfather game too. He's like a walking GQ profile. You'll love him. And he's got a bunch of activities lined up for us. Oh, yeah, the works, boating, golfing, museum tours. I'm intrigued by the golf option. Monica, I'm signing this up for lessons. Yeah, OK. You know I look cute with a visor. So level with me, Joy. This engagement is moving at rapid speed. Am I wrong? Like a bullet train. What are they thinking? They're thinking, when you know you know, just like when I met my Joy. We would like to throw the kids a big party our last night here. I hope we can count on you for a toast. Oh, wow, will I find the words? Oh. Who's up for some dancing? My mom's not really of the dancing clock. I know. I'm just resting my feet. Well, I dance. Count me in. Here we go. Vacation Denise is enjoying every second of this until she turns back into a pumpkin. Well, get it, vacation Denise. Get it vacation Denise. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. It's my shoe. I'm sorry, y'all. I should get her back to the hotel. Thank you so much. I love you too. All right, I think that's all the dancing for vacation Denise. Come on. Denise, it's me. Monica, use your key. It is golf time. Oh. OK, OK, I will call and cancel. No, you should go. I'll be fine in a day or so. Until then, go for it and golf. Vacation Denise needs to live vicariously through you. OK, if you're sure... All right, I'll make it a quick lesson. But after that, no more fun and games. Operation Kibosh will be in full swing. Full swing? Uh-huh. I see what you did there. You saw what I did there? Oh, gosh, come on. The point is to hit the ball. Are you stalking me? Because if so, consider me flattered. Of all the resorts on the golf course, you got to be staying at mine. Well, not exactly. OK, well, my golf instructor didn't show, but I watched an instructional video this morning. So I'm good. So you took a lesson to prepare for a lesson. I did. Classic. OK. Try this. Thank you. You're welcome. Oh, gosh. Yep. I just need to... I need to tighten up a bit. Do you mind if I give it a shot? OK. You can watch all the instructional videos you like, but to succeed, you have to relax and surrender to your swing. Oh, so I'm supposed to believe that Tiger Woods relaxed and surrendered his way to the Masters? That sounds like a bunch of woo woo nonsense. Well, OK. Well, it's been almost 10 minutes. I have half a mind to just bail on this all together. What about the other half of your mind? Does it want to stay? Oh, come on. Are you serious? You're the golf instructor? At your service. And there is no late here, we are on beach time. Oh, well, that is one way to justify it. Wait, if you're the golf instructor, that means that you're Forrest Norwood's fraternity brother. Alpha for life. And you're the reason for this absurd engagement trip. And you disapprove of your daughter marrying my godson. I do. What's wrong with you? It's me. So this is what you ran off to. I needed a caffeine boost. Mind if I join? Don't you dare put that on your unsanctioned tab. Hi, I'm Willa. My sister. Hey, Monica Rollins. This resort is fabulous. Oh. Whoa. Oh, my gosh. Coming through. Do they ever take a breather? I hope not. They are good for business. It was nice meeting you, Monica. Nice to meet you too. Get out of here. Those spring breakers reminded me of when I was in college. Forrest and I would go to Mexico. We lived it up. And did you think either of you were mature enough or old enough to get married? Absolutely not. Exactly. Well, what about you? What? What did you do for your spring breaks? Wait, let me guess. Carefully regulated sightseeing tours complete with guidebooks. Wrong. I had to always work. And then I got pregnant and had Vivian, my senior year. It must have cramped your style in a lovingly maternal sort of way. Yeah, OK. Eat your croissant. I got to get my foot out of my mouth. You are. There you go. There's room now. But are we sure I did not die and go to heaven? So honey, have you and Shawn decided what you're going to do after graduation? Where are you going to live? You know mom I'm so happy that this spa is inspiring such casual conversation. Oh, marriage isn't casual, honey. And I just... I want you to walk into it with eyes wide open. Is Shawn going to be able to provide stability? Mom, can we please just talk about this later, maybe in private? Fine. Thank you. I just... I don't want you to just hitch your wagon to the first decent boy that comes around. So I just wanted to... Later. Yeah. Sierra, who are you dating? Miss Rollins, St. Owen. I'm tragic, not like Vivian and all her boyfriends. Oh, let's see. There was Greg from high school. And there was Ethan from freshman year. And who was that guy from the football team? Yes, who was that guy on the football team, Vivian? You know, mom, now that I think about it, no one important enough to introduce you to. So Greg, he just wanted to copy my homework. Football guy, oh, zero sense of humor. Ethan, he only use you to make your lab partner jealous. You're really going after this, aren't you? Uh-huh. See mom, all duds before Shawn. He's the one that respects me. He knows how I take my coffee. He makes me laugh. No one was good enough to introduce you to. Now that we're done talking about all of Vivian's past, can we maybe relax instead of you being all stressy. When in Rome. So what exactly is your beef with Shawn. I don't have beef with Shawn. I just met him. Well, I've known him his entire life. And he's intelligent, ambitious, perfect gentleman. Kid's never been in any kind of trouble. So your daughter is lucky. Oh, he's the lucky one. He hit the jackpot with Vivian. I just think they're too young. Says who? They're having fun. Fun? Yeah. Marriage is work. It's about partnership and commitment. It's not fun. Well, it should be. Maybe that's why I never went down the old marry with children path. Then fine one you are to be giving me advice. So forgive me if I take your point of view with a grain of salt. Oh, my gosh. You like it? Shawn, It's my... It's my dream ring. Let me put it on you Oh, I love it. I'm so glad. Oh, my gosh. We have to show Sierra. You OK? Yeah. I mean, of course, she's going to show her best friend. Yeah. That makes total sense. Yeah, no, it's fine. It's just... there's still no word on my law applications yet. I spent so much time working on that. With your grades and extracurriculars, you got this. I know my mom just expects me to accept some lucrative job offer. I just want to do something meaningful. Just follow your heart babe, like you always do. I tried that once. Hey, how are you doing since the breakup? Surprisingly well actually. I was wrong about her. We had nothing in common, like nothing. Not like you and Viv. Yeah. They're disgustingly perfect. Yeah. Yeah, we are. Oh. It's kind of burnt. But Ty, you still got work to focus on, right? True. My dad is clamoring for Shawn to graduate and join us at the accounting firm. You're going to work there too, Shawn? No, TBD. No offense, Ty, but I can't work for dad every day. What? No. Since when? I thought that you were set on getting your qualifications for your license and then moving to Milwaukee in the fall. We never finalized moving there, so. I didn't say anything about finalizing, but it was on the table. Hey, we'll cross that bridge when we get there, OK? And it ain't now, OK. Tyson stop. In some cultures, it's considered bad luck to drink coffee while you're standing. I never took you for the superstitious type. I'm the why tempt fate type. So what kind of bad luck am I in for? It means that the plans that you may have for today may not pan out. OK, you're messing with me. No, scout's honor, seriously. See, the point is to be present, and in the moment, not worry about what happens next. This art is amazing. And this link says this is the biggest art festival in the Southeast. And it's held on the Gulf Coast once a year. I had no idea and I love art. Thank you girls for inviting me. It was Viv's idea. My mom used to drag me to a lecture or a museum every Sunday after church. Oh, a museum would be a cool idea for a wedding venue. I was actually thinking about the Drake back home. Shawn and I want to do a summer wedding. So I was hoping that you would reach out to Marie. She still is your contact over there, right? Oh, honey, you know that place is so expensive. And it stays busy. And you probably won't get a booking for two, three years. I just think it's worth a shot though, especially because you have pulled through your job. What's the rush, huh? You have all the time in the world to get married, have children, have... Honey? Oh, my god. Mom. No, I just... I had to ask, but I'm happy. No, I just... I want you to take your time and make sure Andrew is who he says he is. Who is Andrew? Shawn. Mom, I recognize that you did not have the happiest of marriages, but this is so different. God. Yeah, I just don't think that any of this is evoking what it is you're trying to communicate. Oh, I should include that melting ice cap piece we saw back there in my video montage. That's perfect. Which video? The video? Sierra is on a crusade to make our campus green. I only have a couple of months to get enough signatures for my petition. That is a worthy cause, Sierra, but I just... I guess I don't understand how the video factors in. I need catchy imagery to pop off and draw attention to the cause. OK, so I'm going to give some advice. I think that click baiting may be perceived as unprofessional, but I think it would help you use literature to outline your mission statement. Miss Rollins, nobody reads anymore. I actually think you should listen to her Sierra she's the senior vice president at her foundation. She basically runs the whole thing. You know what? Viv, that's OK. OK, you guys ready? Let's go grab the picture. OK, I think that's actually perfect. I do too. I figured the walking tour might have been too much for Denise's ankle. So I thought I'd travel you ladies around in style today. Oh, Clark, you're my hero. That's right. Monica, will you take a photo of me like for Lester. Excuse me. Here we go. OK, that looks good. Oh, hold on one second. One second. Hi, Maria. Thank you for calling me back. Listen, if Vivian calls looking to book the wedding space, can you tell her it's not available? You know Whatever excuse you think you should... She's just joking. Thank you. Bye, girl. Seriously? Imagine if your parents did that to you when you got engaged, how would have made you feel? Devastated, right? You know you raised an amazing kid. Thank you. And speaking of kids, what kind of programs and resources do you have here for teens? You know what? I'm sorry. My warped brain, I just... I can't turn it off. What do you do exactly? Social programming. A do-gooder, I can see that. Well, we help local, at risk teens, and young adults find jobs with their studies and subsidizing daycare programs. Admirable and fulfilling, I'm sure. It is. So what about you? Me? Yeah, what did you study in college besides kickstands? Well, international finance, actually. Wow. I'm still trying to think of a way to apply it in a small way, maybe start a business on my own someday. OK, so aren't you full of surprises? You ain't seen nothing yet. This is good, yeah. It's pretty good. Thank you for recommending it. Look at these guys. Shawn, come here. My grandmother was Caribbean. And she always told us, you never marry if you let our broom sweep over your feet. For real? For true. We're trying to get you off on a good foot. OK, so what is it with you and all these sayings? Well, my last and most serious girlfriend, Lisa, was an anthropologist. And right when we, , she was doing her thesis on regional superstitions. I see. How serious? We almost got engaged, but she wanted the wedding, and kids, and the picket fences ASAP. And I was still wrapped up in following my own dreams. So I... yeah. No, then it's good you called it off. I mean, I wish someone had swept over my feet before I took the plunge. Vivian's father? Oh, yeah. So we met junior year. And oh, it was fun at first, a whirlwind. And we wanted to get married right away and I got pregnant. And anyway, I can't blame him. We were both babies. It just couldn't work. But Anton, he's a good dad in his own way. OK. But he and Vivian just don't have the best relationship. Well, I'm sorry. I can only imagine how challenging it was navigating all of that on your own. I envy what you and Vivian have. It's beautiful. It wasn't easy at first, but I had Denise and my parents. So it worked out. OK. Do you realize I'm dumping on you again, Clark? Again. Oh, my gosh. I told you. I told you I have that effect. You did. Cheers. All right. Willa. Joy and Forrest went up to their room, take a load off, join us. Don't mind if I do. Right here, right here. OK, I'm just going to ask. That's why Denise did this, I'm going to ask, OK, so your brother tells me he was in finance. Am I to believe him? Yes, he was the CFO of a big tech company back in San Francisco. Wow. Corporate, big cheese is a golf pro. That's the big leap. Yeah. I know. My husband Richard passed away last year. And I really needed my little brother shoulder to cry on. I know I tease him a lot, but I'm really grateful he's here. I'm sorry for your loss, Willa. Thank you. Is that why Clark moved back? That's part of it. Oh, it must have been wonderful to have his support. I guess I don't understand. There's a lot of finance jobs here, why would he abandon his career and everything he trained for? He had his reasons. OK. Yes. Look at it. That's my baby. Like mother like daughter? Let's do this. If you allow me to make a slight adjustment. Oh, hey, hey. This is not a Kevin Costner movie. Savage, Miss Rollins. So Shawn, with your business degree, I'm sure you'll have plenty of lucrative options. So what have you envisioned for your future? I have watched Shawn accomplish anything he puts his mind to. It's only because I have you cheering me on. Hold up. Money isn't everything. What matters most is being passionate about what you're doing. I'm sure you'd agree with that, right? Well, passion doesn't pay the bills. When I was her age, I was constantly worried about money and making ends meet. I don't want that for my daughter. Well, there's more than enough time for them to figure all of that out. Oh, don't listen to him. He was at the top of the corporate ladder and for some reason gave it all up to teach middle aged ladies to play golf badly. Well, when you're at the top where else is there to go? I don't want my daughter distracted on her path. She needs to be laser focused on her road to success. Not everyone defines success the same way. You work in a nonprofit. But that doesn't mean I lack ambition. And she knows I want her to have the world so she can share the fruits of her labor. No pressure there at all. Oh, pressure can be motivating. I'm using pressure right now to master my swing. Watch. Ball. Please, yes, yes, yes. All right, OK. Whoa? Did you see that? You hit it. That was a lot of pressure. Pressure. I just got off the phone with my dad. Did you tell him about us? Well, before I could even get a word in, he starts ranting about not squandering my youth away or not settling down before the time is right. It was so weird. I mean, you don't have to get married right away. Wait, I'm sorry, what? I thought you were down for a summer wedding. No, baby I am, but you don't have to hurry. I'm not going anywhere. What is happening? I can't believe my trip is halfway over? We were just getting to know each other. Excited to head back to Chicago and all that do-goodery of yours? Yeah. You know when Vivian was little, I was dependent on programs like the Windy City. So I guess I know firsthand how important it is. Paying it forward. I respect that, but you can lighten up on yourself and have more fun, right? It must be nice to be so cavalier. Women in my position have had to work at least twice as hard to get half the respect. I would never diminish all that you've accomplished, but you can loosen the reins a little bit for the sake of you both. Forgive me if I don't want to upend my entire life because some overgrown teenager on a perpetual vacation thinks I should loosen up. Copy that. We should get going. I got it. You good? I think I put my foot in my mouth with Vivian. And I know Miss Rollins isn't happy about the engagement. Well, Miss Rollins has a lot of opinions about a lot of things. Yeah, she does. Just don't let it get to you. Don't let her get to me? She'll be my mother-in-law, Clark. That means holidays, birthdays, special events, everything forever. But she seemed to get a kick out of you today. Maybe you can put in a good word for your godson. No. Clark, come on. You got this. She just needs more time to get to know you. And then Clark had the nerve to lecture me on being too controlling with Vivian. It's not like I haven't told you that 1,000 times. Oh, please. You've been there from the jump so you can weigh in on the things I do with my little girl. Monica, she's not so little anymore. Yeah, well, I don't care how old she gets. She will always be my baby. And I know what's best for her. You need to chill. Mom. Hey. Are you serious? What? You called dad on me? I knew that you had your reservations, but I really did not think that you would try to sabotage my engagement. It's not sabotage, honey. It's reason, because you caught up in the excitement right now, but when you come down to reality, you will regret this. I know it. Mom, what makes you the expert? You haven't been in a relationship in years. I'm done. Vivian. Sorry. All right, you're right. I'm not an expert at dating. I swear mom you don't date. Listen, I'm saying, I was in the same boat as you when I married your father. And I just, I don't want you to repeat my mistakes. So I'm a mistake? Vivian, of course now, you know I didn't mean it that way. You know what, mom, this is happening whether you like it or not. So if you cannot figure out how to support us then you can just skip the party that Joy and Forrest are throwing us. Matter of fact, if you want, you can skip the whole wedding What are you doing out here, late night lessons for frat boys? Meditating. Oh. Care to join me? I know what you're thinking. Why would an overgrown teenager like Clark need meditation and mindfulness practice. I shouldn't have said that. It's not my place to criticize the way you lead your life. The way I criticized yours? There is a reason I left my lucrative career in finance, Monica. It cost me my relationship with Lisa. Then last year, we launched new software and I was working around the clock. One night I started having chest pains. I thought for sure I was having a heart attack. It turns out it was stress. My blood pressure was sky high and the doctor said I was at risk for the real thing. My brother-in-law had just passed. And all my priorities were shifting. I realized that life is way too short to work myself to death. So I walked away. And return to beach time. I guess that was just my turn to share all my dirty little secrets. Oh, please, taking control of your well-being is hardly dirty, Clark, but I'm glad you felt comfortable enough sharing it with me. I guess you have that effect. So are you happy with your decision? My blood pressure is way down. Yeah. I'm happy about that. I wasn't trying to spy on you. I was just getting ice. Listen, it wasn't your fault. I was acting like a petulant child, so. Clearly. Oh, right now? I can see why you come out here to unwind. Can't beat the view. You sure can't. Hey, Shawn. Shawn, where's everybody? Where's Vivian? Is she OK? No, she isn't. And to be frank, neither am I. My parents were so excited to meet you and to unite our families, but you spent this entire trip plotting against us. Vivian loves you so much, but respectfully, your behavior has been a slap in her face. I'm not proud of what I did. I'm aware of Vivian said she would proceed with or without you, but I cannot abide by that. If we don't have your blessings I cannot move forward, no matter what she says. I know Vivian would never be happy if you aren't a part of our wedding. And if she isn't happy, neither am I. I'm sorry. Come on, now. I thought I turned that frown upside down yesterday. Don't tell me I have to repeat the performance. Things go sideways with Vivian? TBD. But she agreed to meet with me tonight. Although I don't know what I'm going to say. And that breaks my heart. My own daughter is turning to a stranger in front of me. May I make a humble suggestion? Meet her on her level. Well, I wish I knew where that was. And I can't seem to say or do anything right with anyone these days. I'm a fraud. You sure you're not a type A control freak with a secret penchant for romance movies? OK, you got me there. OK, Clark. Yeah, I haven't been honest with you. I don't work at the Windy City Youth Foundation. I did. And I thought I would be running the place someday, but they canned me right before this trip. Wow. I'm so sorry, Monica. No, they said I was out of step. And you know what? I thought they were just saying that to get rid of me, but maybe they're right. I mean, I'm clearly out of step with my daughter. And the Windy City is just doing so well without me. So I certainly overstayed my welcome. Does Vivian know about this already? No, only Denise and now you. I just wanted to secure a job before I told her. I think you're entirely too hard on yourself. There, I said it. No, my ideas, Clark, they were outdated. Maybe not, but all this stuff with the job that's your fault. Excuse me. If you hadn't sustained the foundation all these years they wouldn't even be around to fire you. OK. It's because of you that your baby is now big enough and strong enough to walk all on her own without your help. You should be proud of that. Why does it feel like we're not talking about work anymore? Here, let me help you with your putt. No Kevin Costner movies. I'll keep a safe HR distance. You got jokes. All right, let's go. What am I doing wrong? All right. Oh. That's it? Not bad. OK. You like what you see and I can tell that. Started making your move and then you fell back. Why? Really? Yes. You can come from the utilitarian mindset. Why are you so caught up on what you can lose? I need you to throw some bands on it, take a chance on me. Meet my crew. This is Heather, Roy, Monica, and you know Forrest. Hello, everybody. Y'all come meet Monica. Any friend of Clark's is a friend of ours. Forrest, was Clark this much of a playboy back in the day? Nah. He wasn't much of a wingman either. He'd start talking everyone's ear off about some math equation and run them off. Oh. I guess times have changed because Karen called me the other day Clark and she's still asking about you. Oh-oh, another broken heart. Well, Karen is a delightfully, wonderful person. She just isn't the right woman for me. Right before I met you I ain't filling mine. Now up in my head is only you. Morning brew. It's for my boo. So lame. And I think mom is going overboard on that party she's throwing for us. I already told my pops. I'm not moving to Milwaukee. Oh, I thought that was still on the table. Oh, it's all good. He was cool about it. Cool about what though? Because have you decided what you're going to do instead? Wow, so it's a lot like her mother. That is supposed to mean what? Nothing, baby I... Babe I was just... I was kidding. Why do we keep finding ourselves on different pages? Found you. So I want to challenge you to a duel or poker, I just thought it sounded more dramatic. Oh, right now? Why not? It's spring break. Yeah. Yeah? Please. OK. What do you want to play? Texas Hold'em, Shawn do you know how to play? I can learn. Baam. What do we have here? Oh, we're learning that Miss Rollins has been hiding some tricks up her sleeve. You can join, but you should know, I play to win. Laying the smack down. I see you. All right, hand it in everybody. Come on, Shawn. All right. Here we are. You want to explain. I'm meeting Vivian on her level. Good for you. So Shawn. Yes. It's been brought to my attention that I haven't gotten to know you properly. My fault. So lay it on me. I'm all ears. Well, my all time favorite movie is Coming to America. Oh. Taking it old school. Yeah, I can definitely work with that. And when I was little, I used to carry around my dad's old hat like it was a stuffed animal. Vivian knows about that. I have been exposed, terrible thing. Oh, you folded already? I'm quitting while I'm ahead. Check, OK. What are you going to do? I'm in. She gets it from me. She got it from her momma. So Shawn, how did you know Vivian was the one? It's kind of simple. Whenever something good, or bad, or silly, or pretty much anything interesting happens, she's the first person I want to tell. And she's the only person I want to share my ups and downs with. I'd say the young brothers stuck the landing. Oh. I'm going to call you honey. And I'll do a little race. What you got Shawn? Oh, come on, Shawn. Come on, girl. Come on. Fold. All right, all right, all right. That's what y'all should do when you don't have a hand. All right, all right. Is this deck rigged? Check this out. OK, so I incorporated the material that you sent. And the signatures are flying off the shelves. OK, that expression doesn't really apply, but you know what I mean? I've exceeded my goal. Wonderful, Sierra. That's fabulous. Right? Yes. You and I were a super successful collab. I'm going to send it to the dean as soon as we get home. We were weren't we? Yeah. Sierra, that's awesome. Oh, yeah? Yeah. That's a lot of stuff after all. You versus me? Oh, game on. Game on. Let's do it. Let me get my money fresh. I took one nap and I missed everything. Details. OK, OK. So first, I still slay at poker. Oh. Secondly, I think I like Shawn. Oh, how long was I asleep? Does that mean you approve of the engagement? Oh, girl, I wouldn't go that far, but I understand what Vivian sees in Shawn. Oh. I know. Baby steps. We're making progress. You sure you're OK with this? Of course. Come here. Oh, no. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. Are you guys OK? Yeah, this is just me losing my favorite golf instructor. But yes, we're good. Uh-huh. Please, join me. So you remember that little secret about me starting a business? Yeah. It's not a secret anymore. Good for you. Good for you, Clark. Well, I have you to thank. I don't understand. I'm going to start a foundation where we grant golf scholarships to underserved youth. Yeah, I want them to have the same opportunity I was blessed to have. Wow. I'm also going to establish a camp where we teach the kids to golf. It's about leveling the greens for kids who aren't normally exposed to these opportunities. Wow, Clark, you are amazing. That is amazing. I have some good news too. Hit me. OK, so I decided to start a consulting firm that caters to nonprofits. So I'm going to mix up all my old school stuff with all that new gen-z stuff that Sierra is teaching me, so. Monica. Yeah. That is awesome. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Did you tell Vivian? No you were the first person. You were the first person that I wanted to tell. Well, that makes me very happy. I want to hire you to get things off the ground. Is that an offer? Ma'am, yes, it is. I accept. Wow. Yeah, I wanted to show you this logo I had Denise whip up, but I want your honest opinion. It's magnificent. Roll up your sleeves. Roll up your sleeves, double entendre. I see what you did there. I know. I thought it was really good. Thank you. I haven't been to a club since the '90s. Well, it hasn't changed much. I've been waiting all day to tell you how beautiful you are. Thank you. You know I just felt it was time to let vacation Monica free. All right, all right. Looks like you finally doing spring break the right way. All Right We'll grab drinks for everyone. Yeah, thank you. Like golf... Yeah. Dance is all in the hips. Oh, OK. Oh. What is happening right now? I think someone's impersonating my mother. I told your mom know how to party. Oh, my god. I got to get used to this. Cutting loose, I mean. What are you guys doing here? Chilling, dancing. Uh-huh. Like everybody else. Oh. Take a break? Yeah. Yeah, let's take a break. Don't even try to pretend like that wasn't flirting I just saw. Did you... you seem like you might be a little parched after. OK, OK. Clark, you must be really picky. How is a fine man like you still single? I definitely know what I want in a woman, someone who can challenge me, inspire me, make me laugh. All right now. You've got your own vibe. You've got your own style. Can't believe how I feel. Well, there's a thousand girls out on the street tonight. I know I'm not seeing what I think I'm seeing. Racing, pacing, chasing the wrong thing. They don't want him. It's just the bling, but that ain't real. I mean, he's just... He's just dancing. He can't be serious. Honey, do not react. He's just having fun. Well, he can have his fun. Vivian. Morning, Miss Rollins. Boys, did you have a good night. Vivian won't speak to me. She's been holed up with Sierra all morning. So I thought if I post it up here long enough she walked by. What were you thinking, gyrating with those girls? I wasn't. I swear. OK, yes. We were dancing, but I don't know. I'm just... I'm just so excited about life right now. And I guess I just want to celebrate it with everybody. Yeah, and he was talking about Vivian the whole time he was dancing. And you were talking about Sierra. Yeah, I'm going to go shower. I think you two have a situation. Maybe you can speak with her. You want me to intercede for you, all right, this should be interesting. I lost my head last night. Well, I only have eyes for Vivian, Miss Rollins. I'll never compromise that, trust me. I believe you. Thank you. I know Vivian has trouble trusting me sometimes. And I get that. I've been a little cagey about my plans. Why? Well, we're waiting to see where Viv is accepted to law school. And wherever that is, that's where I want us to live. OK, then what? I worked it all out with my dad. I want to be my own boss. So he's going to help me open up my own local branch of his accounting firm, then I'll get my license in that state, wherever that state is. So you have a plan. Yes, I do. So why haven't you shared any of this with Vivian? Because she's so stressed with everything hitting her right now. And I don't want her worrying about this too, maybe that's also a mistake. I'll talk to her for you. Really? Really. Thank you, Miss Rollins. Don't thank me yet. So I think that I may have overreacted a little last night. And maybe there's something else that you're upset with him about. No. Actually, I'm a little worried about how we're going to map out our futures together. I hate to admit but your concerns are valid. Actually, they're not, but I'll let him explain it. He's got a good head on his shoulders, honey. He loves you. I'm sorry. What's caused this 180? Oh, trust me. I'm as surprised as you are. For so long it's been you and me. Thick as thieves, I carefully mapped out your life for you, protecting you from all the landmines I hid along the way. And I did a pretty good job if I say so myself. You did an amazing job, mom. But I have to trust that all the love, and wisdom, and guidance I poured into you will help you make the right choices in your life because you're not me. It's your life. And your journey is your very own. And I just... I know you're going to be fine. I can feel it. You do know that you're the reason that I do everything that I do. No, I'm serious. Mom, it was that taught me how to be strong. You taught me to have convictions and to know my self-worth. And sometimes, I think that you... I think you look back on our past and all you see is your mistakes. But when I look at my life, I see a woman who gave me everything that she had to give. And then still managed to give me a little bit more. Mom, you have been an incredible role model, an amazing mother. But most importantly, you've shown me what it looks like to be just this incredible woman. And we will always be thick as thieves because I love you too much not to be. I love you. I love you too. Now, I'm messing up your makeup. It's OK. I do you have something else to tell you. I got fired. What? But when one door closes, another one opens. I'm sorry. I didn't know. No, I'm going to be fine. I'm going to be more than fine. Come on, Shawn. She's all yours. Thank you, Ms. Rollins. I love you. Oh. So you can call me Monica. Go on. Sorry, baby. Your business idea, it's amazing. Really? Yeah. Mad respect, Ms. Rollins Thank you. Anything I can help you... Heather. Monica. I did not know this was your booth. Oh, yeah. So OK, I would like something very special for my daughter. Oh, I am here for a makeover moment. What's the occasion? So mom, now that you've got this new outlook on life, I really do think you should consider dating. Oh, gosh. I'm not ready for all of that. Ms. Rollins, give me your phone. Oh, my gosh. OK. I'm creating a dating profile for you. So when you are ready, you have some hotties waiting. I think Sierra is right, I don't think that a dating app would be... You look beautiful, honey. Do we have a winner? Really? You don't think that white is just a little too bridal for an engagement party? Honey, you are the bride, anything goes. You've thought about what kind of wedding you'd like to have? Yeah, Shawn and I actually talked about it last night. We just want something small, family, maybe a few good friends, kind of like this. Oh, it's perfect. I wish we could snuck down, always in the first lane. All right, Clark, one more lesson for the road. Are you ready? I'm ready. You got this. And it looks like you've already had an eventful day. Everything OK? Apparently, I got my first match. Sierra put me on a dating app. I guess I underestimated just how eventful. He's a lucky guy whoever he is. I did it. You did it. I did it. Wow. Thank you, Clark. Oh, look at that. You never cease to amaze me, but you did have the benefit of having an excellent instructor. Well, it looks like you and Sierra aren't the only pair to make a successful collabs. The first of many. After I start consulting for you. Does Roll Up Your Sleeves have a policy on fraternizing with clients? Forget your match. There's someone right in front of you who would love to take you on a date. Clark. Something has been crackling between you and me since we met in that airport. You know I think there could be something really special between us, Monica. I can't. I just... I don't want to muddy the waters and complicate our relationship. It wouldn't work. Is that your nice way of saying you don't go out with overgrown teenage playboys? No, no. I'm just not... No, no. It's fine. I clearly misunderstood. I'm going to get going I don't want to be late for a meeting I have. Hey, what's wrong? You were on top of the world this afternoon. I messed up, Dee, bad. Don't tell me you mess with the engagement again. I'm getting whiplash... Clark ask me out on a date. Amen, hallelujah. And I said no. Girl, I could have bet money you two liked each other. I even told Lester about you. I guess I do. And I haven't felt this way for anybody in a really long time, but I freaked out. What is the matter with me? Nothing. You got scared it's a big step. No shame. Just tell me you made a mistake. He's going to think I'm crazy. Well, if you want you then he's going to accept every part of you, even the crazy. I'm just saying it. Hey, it's you, mother of the bride. Join us. Thank you. We heard that you saved the day earlier. Well, played and much appreciated. No, you both raised an incredible young man. And it's my honor to welcome him into our family. We feel the same way about Vivian. Thank you. Have you seen Clark? He said that he had some business in the city. He won't be back before we leave in the morning. We already said our goodbyes. Everything OK? Yeah. The show must go on, right? That's for sure. Joy has been working with Willa on all the details for tonight's party. About that. I have a crazy idea and I just hope I can get both of you on board. OK, just hear me out. So you want us to do what? Get married, here, tonight. Only if you want to. And I've already got approval from your parents. Vivian, you said you wanted something like this, so. Babe, what do you think? I think it's pertinent. OK, OK, OK. We got a lot to do. We got to get your dolls out. OK, let's go. Oh, not you, not you. Oh, you mean her. OK, OK, OK, OK. I'm getting married. Let's get married. Honey, are you OK? Yeah, no. It's nerves, good nerves. OK. Thank you for doing this. Of course. The nerves are natural. I thought I'd lose my blanch when I married Lester. Oh, don't go getting teary eyed, you'll mess up your make up. You feel good? Yeah. You've got this. Shall we? Yeah. OK. You ready? You've got this. Is my daughter in here? Wow. Daddy. I invited him because I know how much you miss him. And he deserves to be here. I wouldn't have missed this for anything in the world. I've missed you so much. Are you ready? May I? Of course. I love you, little girl. I love you too, daddy. I love you, sweetheart. I love you too, dad. We're all gathered here on this beautiful evening to join these two individuals and these two families in the bonds of matrimony. The union of marriage signifies a sacred commitment of everlasting love and devotion to one another. Shawn, Vivian would you like to share your vows? I only had 30 minutes to prepare. Well, I got you. But I feel like I've been waiting my entire life to meet someone like Vivian, strong, beautiful, brilliant, sarcastic. She keeps me on my toes. I vow to be at your side for the good, bad, and all of it, forever. Shawn, I trust you with my whole heart. And today, I give it to you without reservation. You are the joy of my life. And I promise to be by your side through the good, the bad, and all of it, forever. OK. Well, Shawn, do you take Vivian to be your bride? Oh, yeah. Vivian, do you take Shawn to be your husband? Absolutely. Well, by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. No take backs. You may kiss the bride. And I'm still in bed with you nothing Hold it from that place you like. You didn't need to go outside. On one, two three. All right, me. So first, to my daughter, the pride and joy of my life. I am blessed to be able to share this beautiful evening with you in this beautiful moment with you and your new husband. Throughout all of this, I've learned not only how to let go and let god, but how to let go and let love. And only then can you realize that it's not about the right time. It's about the right person. And I am convinced that Vivian has found the right person with you, Shawn. I'm absolutely proud of the lessons I've taught my daughter, but today, I am proud of the lessons I've learned from her and from, Shawn, from Sierra, Denise, and from a man that is far more wonderful than I could ever imagine. Vivian and Shawn, I love you. Cheers. Come here. Bring it in. I love you. I tried. I loved you. Love is so easy to do. Oh, she's a vibe. I think that I'm falling for you. Mind if I join you. I'm sorry. Why are you sorry? I came in way too hot when I asked you out. I should have appreciated that you need to take things more slowly. I'm out of practice with this. I genuinely wanted to see us, but I panicked. So can I take a mulligan. That's a do over in golf. Oh, OK, OK. Monica Rollins, would you like to go on a date with me? Clark Randall, I would love to. So I was thinking about extending my stay a little because I need a vacation from this vacation. No itinerary, no destination, no schedule, beach time. Right. Mind your business.
