My name is Sebastian. And, yeah, that's me. When my mother used to dress me for pre-school, like I was going to Studio 54. Like most American stories, mine starts a long time ago on another continent. Specifically, the magical island of Sicilia. (BLEATING) SEBASTIAN: A lot of folks like to call Sicily the big ball in front of the boot of Italy, which makes sense 'cause the world's been trying to kick our ass since the dawn of time. (ELEPHANT TRUMPETS) (WHIP CRACKS) (WOMAN SCREAMING) SEBASTIAN: For generations, my people have been threatened by wars, volcanoes, and testicle-crushing Speedos. (GOAT BLEATING) But we survived it all through one unstoppable force. Family. These are actual photos of my Sicilian ancestors. Note the signature Maniscalco look. With the curved spines and the resting bitch face, like a bunch of pissed-off candy canes. Over the past few centuries, these proud hunchback men have operated with one goal. Do everything you can... (COW MOOS) ...to give your kids a better life than the one you had. For my father, this meant leaving his beloved Sicily for Chicago. So he and my mother could give me opportunities they never got. Like shoveling snow. Growing a beautiful mullet. And going to the prom looking like a pit boss. (SLOT MACHINE CHIMING) (MAN WHISTLING) SEBASTIAN: Growing up, my father busted his hump to instill in me certain rules of how a man should operate. Like, if you're awake, you should be workin'. Hey, how's the pressure, Mrs. Marinelli? Harder. You got to get in there, son. I don't pay you by the hour, I pay you by the moan, capisce? (MOANING) SEBASTIAN: Guy with the ponytail, that's my dad. (MOANING CONTINUES) Did I mention he owns a salon? The man comes from a long line of Sicilian hairstylists. And don't you dare call him a barber. This man doesn't just cut hair, he creates styles. Salvo, it's beautiful. See? I told you you had cheekbones under there. You just needed Michelangelo to dig them out. SEBASTIAN: Child labor laws were definitely broken. But on the bright side, I had the most realistic Chewbacca costume in the history of Halloween. (MIMICS CHEWBACCA'S GROWL) SEBASTIAN: He taught me to always save your money. No apps, no dessert. And if you don't finish your main, you're paying for your own birthday dinner. SEBASTIAN: And to be resourceful. You wanted me to buy you a skateboard, I built you one instead. Next year, I'm gonna build you one of those Nintendos. SEBASTIAN: But one exception, cologne. Never cheap out on your signature scent. At bedtime, our house smelled like an Uber in Las Vegas. The only time I saw my father smile is when we did the chicken dance for my mother. To me, this man was a God. And it was all working out great until I grew up, and fell for someone who was my complete opposite. Her name was Ellie. I mean, look at this girl. The style, the positivity, personality. Yeah, this was my dream woman. Sebastian! Ah! I'm so sorry I'm late. This guy's charging $15 for valet. So I parked it nine blocks away. Wait a minute, if you parked that far away, how are you so dry? You sweat just getting the mail. It's the Fendi, babe. It's wicking away. (LAUGHING) You want one? Yeah. You know, everyone said I should serve fancy food at my opening, and I was like, "Name one person that doesn't like a hot dog." SEBASTIAN: And get this, she's an artist. I mean, growing up, I wasn't even allowed to do it as a hobby. So how's the show going? Oh, my God! Freaking amazing. All my pieces sold out in like 15 minutes. Babe, that's incredible. I know, right? I mean, most of them went to this big decorator, but they have clients all over the world, so I'm not complaining. Well, you shouldn't. Especially because they look, kind of like, you know... ELLIE: Vaginas? Well, you know, if you just hang them horizontally, they kind of look like sunsets. Oh, yeah. (SOFTLY) Right. SEBASTIAN: Since the day I met her, she's been opening my eyes to all kinds of new experiences. Like naps. Weird. The sun's coming through the drapes. And beauty treatments. Hey, hot stuff. Looking good. Wait, are you mad? Yeah. That it took 42 years to discover avocado masks. And last but not least, smiling. Okay. Um... It's not natural. That's... That's not particularly natural. But you know what I think? I think we just have to build these facial muscles, so you just got to practice. Look at that. Now try it. I don't... (GASPS) You look great. SEBASTIAN: Yeah, life with Ellie was pretty perfect. (MY MAN BY CRUSH CLUB PLAYING ON SPEAKERS) SEBASTIAN: I don't think I could participate. That's just ridiculous. ELLIE: You promised. Oh, come on! A public wedding proposal? It's embarrassing. ELLIE: I think it's sweet. When I propose to you, it's going to be intimate. Hmm. Just you and me, the way it should be. Hmm. No one else. Used to be, "If I propose." You just said, "When I propose." Okay, babe, it's just... I'm aggravated. Words are just flying out of my mouth. Well, just so you know, the only way I will say yes, is if there is some element of public humiliation involved. Oh, well. Get ready. You might as well just end the relationship right now, because we ain't doing that. Oh, we're not? I'm not doing this. But you're such a good dancer. Look at these people. MAN: Uh, Ellie? I kind of need your help right now. Right, dude, we are in! (PEOPLE CHEERING) SEBASTIAN: The truth was, I had every intention of asking Ellie to marry me. I just needed the right place and time. SEBASTIAN: I see you, guy. (KNOCKING ON WINDOW) I see you. All right? Pick it up. Thank you. Take a walk. ELLIE: Sebastian. I'm on the phone with my parents and get this, they're inviting us out to the summer place for the big 4th-of-July weekend. Babe, did you just say "us"? Us. I thought this trip was for family only. I know! I mean, I'm so torn between thinking this is great news, or that I might be dragging you into an Italian version of Get Out. (WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON PHONE) I'm not sure. Oh, uh, uh... Yes, yes, yes, Mother, yes. I'm asking him right now, please hold. (MOUTHING) What do you think? (SNIFFLES) ELLIE: (SIGHS) Yeah. He's man-crying. That means it's a yes. Yes! I love you. I'm gonna get you tissues. I love you. I'm so excited. SEBASTIAN: So, yeah, I'm a big crier. I love to just marinate in my own tears. BOTH: Mmm. SEBASTIAN: But this was a huge deal. Ellie's summer place wasn't just the perfect spot to propose. It also meant her family was starting to accept me. Which was amazing, because... How do I put this eloquently? These people got class up the ass. I mean, look at these people with their perfect postures, and their perfect teeth. Even their dog went to better schools than I did. (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) SEBASTIAN: I was intimidated, which really didn't make any sense as their story was also an immigrant story. For some reason, theirs was considered more respectable, as it started 400 years ago. Now, this is an actual painting of Ellie's 10th great grandfather, William Love Collins, taking his family to America, on a little boat called the Mayflower. You got it. That one. So while my father came to chase the American dream, the Collins were the American dream, all the way up to Ellie's dad. William Love Collins XII. Only Italian guys I knew with Roman numerals after their names... (CHURCH BELL TOLLING) ...are popes, and Rocky Balboa. (INDISTINCT CHEERING) Her dad is the chairman and CEO of the luxurious Collins Hotel Group, which was awkward, as I happened to run a cool new boutique hotel, which was stealing a lot of his Chicago business. Bottom line? His baby girl was dating the enemy. But Bill wasn't even the scary parent. That honor belonged to Ellie's mother, whose actual birth name was Tigger MacArthur. Anna, darling, you don't know anything about me. SEBASTIAN: And this kitty's got claws. As an Ivy League grad-turned-senator for the state of Maryland, it took her a long time to wrap her mind around her beloved daughter dating some working-class hotel manager. How could I be anti-immigrant when my daughter is dating the son of one? SEBASTIAN: But this invite meant I was finally breaking through. A holiday weekend was my chance to charm the pleated pants off these people. And if all went well, I could ask for their daughter's hand in marriage. So, I had the girl I wanted to marry, the perfect spot to propose to her, and now, I just needed the ring, which should have been easy to get. Oh, come on. What do you mean you're not gonna give me the ring? Grandma left it for me to use when I'm ready to get married. SALVO: Uh, your grandmother left it with me to make sure you just don't give it away to some puttana, that's what your grandmother did. Can you come out of the garden so we can talk about this? (LEAVES RUSTLING) They're back. They're back there messing with my gagootz. Forget the gagootz. Dad, the ring, can I have it? Look at that. You know, I don't know about this girl, I gotta tell ya. I'm not sure about her. She put her feet up on my coffee table, I don't know... You put your feet up on your coffee table. Yeah, my coffee table, my feet. What do you think is this? What bites? A raccoon? Ants? Is it an ant? An ant. You got to to be kidding me. Let's see. Okay, here we are. Look at them. That's a possum. Possum. They're dead. Dead, gone. Oh, no. Come on, with the thing again... Gone from this earth. Instant death. Just set a trap. Yeah, I'm gonna set a trap. I'm gonna get my antifreeze, my little... SEBASTIAN: When I was a kid, I thought everything my dad did was normal. If some string beans went missing, I'd wake up to a yard full of poisoned squirrels, birds, chipmunks, basically anything that ever helped Cinderella get dressed, murdered in our backyard. Come on, Dad. Could you just admit that Ellie's not some puttana? I love her, you love her. Just give me the ring so I can propose. You really serious about this? Yeah, Dad, she's the one. She's the one? Yeah. Okay, son, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna give you the ring. Thank you. But first I gotta meet her family. What? Why? Why? (SPEAKING ITALIAN) (IN ENGLISH) That's why. What the hell does that mean? (SCOFFS) You got no respect for your roots. I mean, what are you talking about? You don't eat the fruit till you make sure the tree ain't sick. And per tradition, I need to look at the mother and the father's eyes. I need to look them in the eyes to make sure there's no rot. Because there could be rot. Not that there is. What? But there could be. There's no rot in this family, Dad. You never know. They're classy. You never know. Come on, they're classy people. Oh, yeah. The fancier, the dirtier. You never know what's going on. Plus, they don't live anywhere near here. So let me just put you on a FaceTime, so you could taste test them over the phone. Hey, I'm not doing FaceTime. This is an important moment. FaceTime, Zoom? What are you, crazy? You don't gotta get all upset. No, gotta be faccia con faccia. Dad, I want to do this next weekend at their family's house in the country. Wait... wait. Hold on, hold on. This is the first summer since we had to say goodbye to your poor dear mother, and you're going to leave me alone for the goddamn 4th of July? Well, it's just that, you know, her family invited me to their summer house. Oh, their summer home? Oh, most people got one home, but they got 'em for different seasons. Oh, that's nice. Come on, Dad. So they got more money than us, who doesn't? Plus, it's just for one weekend. Oh, one weekend, he says. One weekend. Fifty years ago, I come to this country to give you a better life. Fifty years ago, I skipped every weekend in Sicily for you. I joined the US Army to protect your freedoms. And what thanks do I get? You go celebrate the 4th of July with some other family, leaving me to burn the sparklers and eat the hot dogs alone! Alone! Thank you. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) (IN ENGLISH) This is incredible. (CONTINUES IN ITALIAN) Wait, what do you mean you're not coming? I can't leave my father. The 4th of July was their favorite holiday. Because of his military background? No, it's the only holiday you don't have to buy a gift. I'm sorry, Ellie. We'll just do it some other time. Why don't we just bring him? (HESITATES) What happened? I mean, if he... loves the 4th, he's gonna flip out at our place. There's all kinds of fun family activities. There's fireworks. There's even a huge clambake with tons of fresh fish. He loves to de-bone fish. Kind of perfect. SEBASTIAN: My father getting a close-up look at my new life, while I was trying to seal the deal with Ellie's parents? What an incredible idea! Nah, I don't think so. I should probably just stay here with him. Boo! Come on. Don't you want our families to finally meet? (IN HIGH-PITCH) Yeah, of course I do. Why is your voice going up like that? What's going on? Are you... Are you nervous to bring him? Ner... No. (CHUCKLES) No. What? No, no. All right, fine. Don't bring him. Don't come. Don't have fun. It's fine. SEBASTIAN: All right, maybe I was a little scared to bring my father into a country club environment, where he'd see me playing racquet sports, riding around in golf carts, and taking naps. But I also knew that stubborn bastard wouldn't give me the ring without a face-to-face meeting. Fine. You win. I'll ask him. (EXCLAIMS HAPPILY) Hey, don't get all excited, all right? This guy's big on tradition. I doubt he'll even say yes. Shit, yeah. I'm coming. No, wait, wait, wait. Seriously? Of course, I'm coming. What are we gonna do instead? Spend the whole weekend alone, just the two of us in the house, burning the sparklers and eating the hotdogs? Yeah, I'm coming. That's the same example you used to guilt trip me into not going. Well, what can I say. I got a way with words. You know me. All right, listen. If we're gonna do this, Dad, you gotta be on your best behavior. Wha... What do you mean, my best behavior? The family is uptight, they're conservative, they're not used to... Hold on, hold on, hold on. So, you, the son, are telling me, the father, how to behave? You hear this? Just remember the main goal is for you to meet the family, so I can get the ring and propose to Ellie. It's not for you to price check their antique coffee tables. Come on, already! I mean, how fancy could a stupid coffee table be? I mean, seriously, how much we talking? I don't know, Dad. I'm kidding you. Mannaggia. (IN ENGLISH) Where's your sense of humor? Jeez. Come on. All I'm asking is dial it down with the... (MOCKING SALVO) What, all the... This is... What is this? Look at him. Look at him. Dial it down with all this and that. You know what he's worried about? He's worried his immigrant father's gonna make him look like some kind of goombah. Let me tell you something. You don't remember this because I'm your dad but a lot of people find me charming, pretty charming, that's right. Right. Right, ladies? WOMEN: Yeah. (CHUCKLES) And these stuck-up rich people? They got a word for me... I remember, it's loud, it's obnoxious, it's over-cologned. No, no. "Refreshing." "He's refreshing." "He's so original." I've heard that all... All the time I hear that. And I promise you Ellie's parents are gonna love me. I don't know about you, but they're going to love me. Mm-hmm. Ladies, you better get your 'dos done by Thursday 'cause the Maniscalco men, they're going on vacation. He's worried. This kid is worried. I'm not. ( IL MONDO BY IL VOLO PLAYING) (LIGHTER CLICKS) What the hell are you doing? You can't smoke here. What? I'm outside. Next to an airplane! Oh, sorry! STEWARDESS: That's okay. Mannaggia. Can't even smoke a cigar. I got some good news. I got us a luxury sedan for the price of a compact. That's nice, but makes me wonder how much the compact you could've got for. Then I took the compact price and got it on the house! (CHUCKLING) Hey! Hey! Nice! Baby, the bags. Yeah. How long does it take to get there? Um, like, three hours. Hey, you guys looking for a ride? (GASPS) Oh, my God. Lucky! SEBASTIAN: Oh, no. Who's that, an ex-boyfriend? Worse. Brother. LUCKY: Hey! (ELLIE SCREAMING) (ELLIE SCREAMING INDISTINCTLY) SEBASTIAN: While I'd made progress with Ellie's parents, I'd yet to make any with the older brother. His name was William Love Collins XIII. So, everybody called this guy "Lucky." And that's exactly what he was. ALL: Chug, chug, chug, Whoo! Oh, my God! SEBASTIAN: After graduating from Princeton, back when you could bribe your kid into college, Lucky was on deck to take over the Hotel Group while working as a "Client Liaison." Gentlemen! Who's ready to go hunt some endangered species? I'm just kidding. Unless you guys are down, I can figure something out. SEBASTIAN: This meant traveling around the world, entertaining wealthy clients with all the rich kid hobbies he had time to master. Whoo! SEBASTIAN: We're talking skiing... Whoo! Snowboarding sucks! SEBASTIAN: ...y achting. (SLURPING) ...all the country club sports. Whoo! Looks like I gotta change my shoes, 'cause I'm on the dance floor. What! (EXCLAIMING IN EXCITEMENT) SEBASTIAN: But I'd say his overall best skill was being a prick. (BLOWS RASPBERRY) LUCKY: There he is. I see you're still banging the bellboy. ELLIE: Luck! No! LUCKY: Hey! I'm only joking, Sea Bass. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Hey, what's up, Luck? (IN ENGLISH) Not much. You must be Sebastian's brother. Hey. No, I'm his father. Salvo. How are you? No way! Seriously? That's crazy. I can't tell the age of anybody over 40. (SCOFFS) Anyway. Oh, let me goose you guys some free samps. I'm an angel investor in this new anti-aging skin cream for men and I'm obvi a client. (CHUCKLES) This guy. You boys ready to saddle up? (GASPS) LUCKY: Let's go! Oh, chopper time! El... El, I don't think this is such a good idea. Yeah, we got a free car, you know. Guys, come on! Trust me, the helicopter takes 20 minutes, and the views are magical. Are you with me? (SIGHS) Come on! Let's have some fun! MAN: (ON RADIO) Lucky, you are cleared for takeoff. LUCKY: Roger that, Roger. Dude's name is Roger. We hang. Got a super-hot wife. Hey, if you guys look out to your left, you'll see the beautiful Roanoke River. ELLIE: Baby, look. Salvo, it's nice, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's nice. Reminds me of 'Nam. (EXHALES) Huh? Yeah, I'm fine. It's good. Okay. Okay. I'm fine. (THUDDING) Oh, yeah. Sorry. Sorry. I got it. I got it. (ELLIE CHUCKLES) (LUCKY CHUCKLING) Had a couple too many G and Ts. He's kidding. He's kidding. SALVO: Yeah, yeah. The air don't work. SALVO: No, it does. It works, it works. It's okay. Only a couple of minutes. It's just a little warm, Dad. Son, it's... I think we got a problem here. What? We got a problem here. Oh, my God! Baby! (SEBASTIAN WHEEZING) Yeah, I can't breathe. Wait, wait, wait. Take a bite out of the lemon. It'll help with the nausea. I'm not doing a whole lemon. I'll cut it. I'll cut it. Don't worry. Hey. I'll cut it into pieces. Hold on. I got a knife. (GASPS) He's got a knife. Oh, my God. He's got a knife. I'm cutting the lemon. Okay, here. Take it. Take it. Baby, suck it. Suck on that. ELLIE: Suck on that lemon. Suck. ELLIE: Just suck! Suck, suck, suck! LUCKY: Sounds like my Saturday night. ELLIE: Suck! LUCKY: Dude. Do not vom in my bird. He's not gonna vom in your bird. Just breathe in through the nose, out through the mouth. SALVO: Suck on that. It's making it worse. Suck it! LUCKY: Cradle the balls. SALVO: Suck on that! ELLIE: You just suck! Just suck it. Suck the lemon! SALVO: Take it easy, kid. I think we should turn around. He's freaking out. It's like 19 more minutes. You can't tough it out for 19... It stinks! Let's bring it down. Let's bring it... Open up the windows! I'm gonna die! Put the air conditioning down there. Bring it down. How are you so calm? LUCKY: Roger, we're coming back. I'm dying! Put it down! Put it down! Ah! (SIGHS) I knew I should've forced him to join the army. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Laugh it up. Laugh it up, guys. I'm just happy I'm on the ground. Okay, gentlemen. Welcome to White Oak. Wow! Right? Ah, boy. Um, okay, so, that's the golf course, and then the tennis courts are back down there. Oh, baby, look. Right there? That's my childhood fort. SEBASTIAN: Oh. ELLIE: We'd go there. whenever I needed to get away from my family. So, basically, all the time. Yeah, I wish I had one. (GASPS) Oh, look! Oh, my God! It's Sergeant Feathers and his family! SEBASTIAN: What is this? Oh, my God! SEBASTIAN: What are you doing? (GASPS) What up, dudes? SEBASTIAN: What are you... Is this safe? Yeah, no, she's crazy. What's that? What are you doing? Be careful. SEBASTIAN: Get back in the car! They're gonna eat you alive! Oh, my God! Aren't they the best? Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're so beautiful! So how much a peacock cost anyway? SEBASTIAN: Don't answer that, El. SALVO: I didn't know they had peacocks in Virginia. Oh, well, my grandfather brought two here decades ago, but they didn't like their cages, so he decided to let them roam free. And now, they've pretty much just become the official mascots of our club. Well, they're bad luck where I come from. They're just a bunch of goddamn showoffs, if you ask me. I don't like them. They're lucky to be born that way. They could've been born like a chicken, or a pigeon. I mean, it just has fancy feathers, so all of a sudden, it gets more respect. (CHUCKLES) Okay, guys. We're here. Welcome to our house. SEBASTIAN: Look at this! Are you kidding me? SALVO: How much a house like this cost? SEBASTIAN: Enough with the Price is Right! ELLIE: He's the Bob Barker of the backseat. (SEBASTIAN GROANS) (CAR HORN HONKING) Oh, my little cuddle monkey! Hey! Hi! Hi. (TIGGER LAUGHING) Oh, my girl. BILL: Oh! Oh, what a beauty! Ellie-Bellie! SEBASTIAN: You know, looking back at this, my dad had to be overwhelmed. Family's a little handsy, huh? It's called love and affection, Dad. Unlike you, when you met me in the delivery room and chose to shake my hand. What else was I supposed to do? We just met. (SIGHS) Huh? ELLIE: Guys, come on. I want you to meet Sebastian's father. Hey, Sebastian. Hi. Nice to see you. Pleasure. Welcome. SALVO: Nice to meet you. Sebastian, so good to see you. And you must be the charming Salvo. So nice to finally meet you in person, Tigger. It's just last week I was checking out your highlights on TV. Oh, the CNN or the Fox ones? No, no, the blonde ones. You hair, if I can say, is just like a block of marble. I wanna sink my tools into it. Dad, Dad, Dad, what are you doing? Sorry, I mean, it's... You're gonna hit her. Well, Salvo, we've heard you're quite the stylist. Now, tell me this, do you think I'm too old to pull off a set of frosted tips? (ALL LAUGHING) "Frosted tips?" Good one, sir! Solid gold! All right, I'm gonna hit the links. ELLIE: Have fun! LUCKY: Hasta luego! So, uh, why don't you come inside, and we'll give you the grand tour. Don't worry about the bags. Wendell will take care of them. ELLIE: Mommy... SALVO: That's a pretty big dog you got there. BILL: Oh, that's Duke. We don't get too rough with him, 'cause we're afraid he'll kill us. (ALL LAUGHING) He's so big! ELLIE: Dad! BILL: This is our house. SEBASTIAN: Wow! TIGGER: Yes. SALVO: It's unbelievable. TIGGER: It's so big. (ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) TIGGER: Oh, this is our youngest son, Doug. He's practicing... ELLIE: Hi! ...his sound bowls. Oh, yeah... Sound bowls? What is that? Oh, well, now, a sound bowl is... It's, actually, it's an instrument. It puts out this vibration that relieves stress and promotes relaxation. He's... he's learning to be a healer. (CHUCKLING) Uh, but we're just so proud of him. You're so loud, Dad. Oh, sorry. Oh, sorry, sorry. Let me just... Sorry. No, I'm gonna close the... Play, boy, play. Play to soothe the savage beast. Well, you don't have to shut 'em. (BILL CHUCKLING) Wow! This house is amazing! Look at this! TIGGER: This is nothing. You should see the place in Aspen. (ALL CHUCKLING) Well, it's just, you know... Yeah. I love this cocktail table. Oh, Sebastian! Good eye! The first commercial coal mine in the country was right down the road from here, and this piece is made out of the wood from one of the original mine cars. Drenched in history. Drenched. Good for you, re-using old wood like that. BILL: Yes. This guy always gets on me about picking up trash and putting it in the house. (CHUCKLES) Trash? It's crazy, the stuff that people throw away these days. It sure beats paying for it, I mean, right? So, I... I take it. Right. Yes. Yes. That is so true. Yeah. Um, actually, though, we did pay for this one. (ELLIE CHUCKLES) A king's ransom, (CHUCKLES) if I must say, but at least it's too rickety to put drinks on. (ALL CHUCKLING) Dad, that's the worst. No, no, we just, we wanted something that matched the art in the room. SALVO: Oh, good for you, hanging up your kids' art work like that. No, these are original Grandma Moseses. Can you believe it? I'm... I'm sorry. BILL: We found them... I'm sorry. BILL: What? I'm sorry. I mean, I... I didn't mean to insult your grandmother. I meant no disrespect. I had no idea. I mean, what was the matter with her? Was she a little... (SPEAKING ITALIAN) (IN ENGLISH) Oh, my God. Hey, who's hungry for lunch? I am. ELLIE: Me, me, me! We could all go down to The Shack. ELLIE: Oh, Salvo, you're gonna love The Shack! What a great idea! (WE NO SPEAK AMERICANO PLAYING AS RINGTONE) It's me. Wow, this club is huge, Bill. The way you were describing it, I expected a place where they're serving grilled cheese out of a little window, you know. Yes, I suppose they've fixed it up over the years. But to us it will always be... BOTH: The Shack. This place was built by slaves. Douglass. What, I'm not allowed to tell the truth now? How are we supposed to confront our problems if we don't talk about it, Dad? No, it's true. It's true. The... Some of the history down here is just... it's brutal. Mmm. It's just unthinkable. It's not on the menu, but you can order the club sandwich with lobster. You know, I can't even bring my girlfriend here because I'm ashamed. She's an African person. She is a person emailing you from Africa, and to whom you are sending back money. We have yet to confirm whether she's a girl or a friend. Keep me safe from negative energy. Hi, everyone. Welcome to White Oak. What can I get you guys? Oh, no bread, please. Um, do you have those crackers? The seedy ones? Of course. Gloria, do you have kombucha? I can check. Does anyone want in on this? Ever since I've had kombucha, my BMs have been ...completely regular. BILL: Oh. All right. I've had no problems. All right. Remember, Douglass, we don't talk about our BMs at the table. No. Before I was drinking kombucha, my feces looked like ripped, little pieces of paper and then after I started drinking, they're long, soft logs. (BILL CHUCKLES) Well, all right. Thank you for that. Um, do you know what you want, Sebastian? Just a... the Cobb salad. BILL: Good choice. What are you, one of my sorority sisters? (CHUCKLING) Is that all you're gonna get? You're not gonna get a starter? Yeah, uh, I'm just gonna stick with the middle of the menu. ELLIE: All right, suit yourself. Salvo, what are you gonna get? Gloria, I think I'm gonna have the... the BLT with the onion rings. But what's the price on that dish? Oh, no, we don't... Salvo, this may sound very silly but we don't like to put prices on things, because it's just an annoying reminder of money. Right? Oh! (CHUCKLES) So, everything's for free, you mean? (CHUCKLES) No. No, it is not free. (LAUGHS) I wish it were. TIGGER: (LAUGHING) Nothing is free. So, what do they do? I mean, they make up a price, or... Oh, Dad, it's... you know... Son, I'm talking to Bill, here. Are you Bill? Hello, Bill. BILL: (CHUCKLING) It's fine. Everything has a set price. Mmm.
