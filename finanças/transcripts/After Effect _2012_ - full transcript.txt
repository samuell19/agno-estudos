(MultiCom Jingle) (tense music) (phone beeps) - [Sanders] Get me the Senator. - The Colonel. - The situation under control? Jesus Christ. Some fucking mess you've created. You call me when it's done. (slow suspenseful music) - [Sanders] There she is, right there. Come on, step on it. (tires screeching) (woman panting) (gun fires) (sullen music) (woman gurgling) (gun fires) (eerie music) - So, anyone else give me some examples? Tyler? - Um, stem cell research. - Ah. Stem cell research. Yet another moralistically ambiguous topic. Is it ever ethical to sacrifice one embryo to save 10, 20, a hundred or a thousand individuals? Who would like to speak to that? Caleb. - Yeah, I think so. I mean, it's all about the greater good, right? - I don't know Caleb, you tell me. Mr. Anderson. - Well, define the greater good. - Ah, (chuckles) define the greater good. Ava, why don't you do that for us? - I don't think it's right at all. Who's to say one life is more important than another. I mean, where do we draw the line? - So, we have four very different opinions to one question. A four-sided, complex moral question. Now, who's to say that either side will be able to see the other's perspective. Right? Ms. Donovan. - I'm not sure. - Indecisiveness will get you only so far in my class young lady. - Well, then, I'd have to say it's highly unlikely. I mean, it's hard enough to get two people to agree on a movie, let alone the value of one life versus the collective. - Very well put, Ms. Lacie. All right, good people, that takes us to the end. It is indeed semester break, and contrary to what Mr. Caleb believes, I am not an unreasonable man. So, I've only assigned chapter seven and eight to be completed over break. And yes, Mr. Anderson, there will be an exam over this material when you return. - Can't wait. - All right, good people, that's it. Enjoy your break. Get some rest. We'll see you in a couple of weeks. Ms. Donovan, can I speak to you a moment? - What's up, Professor? - Well, I'll be frank, you're missing work. Two research projects, two essay papers, plus you've got a 62 on that last exam. Now, I'm telling you this because you're a good student. Use the break to get it together. Come back, finish out the semester strong. - I do want to. I just, I had to work the night before the exam, and I did give you the Roe versus Wade paper. - Ms. Donovan, I am not your life coach. I'm your professor. You've got time to make up the work. Let's make sure that you do. Okay? - Okay. (phone ringing) Hey. Whats' up? (Lacie sighs) I can't. Okay. Yeah, thanks. (Lacie laughing) Yeah, good. Have a good time. (slow suspenseful music) Yeah, yeah, I'm here. Okay, bye. (dramatic music) (microwave beeping) (light knocking) - [Killian] Lacie. - Hey, Killian. - Good, you are up. Listen, Joe is having a party tonight, and you are coming with me. - Yeah, I don't know. - Okay, well you do know that it is officially break, right? Come on, everyone's doing it. - Is this peer pressure I'm detecting? (Killian laughs) - No, no, but you want to fit in, right? (both laughing) - Yeah, no, I would love to go, but um, I just, I have a ridiculous amount of studying to do, and plus I have to get up early tomorrow, so. - How is the job going? - Uh, it sucks. Overworked, underpaid, typical stuff. - [Killian] Bummer. - Mm-hmm. - Well, since it is a work night, what if I promise to have you home at 11? (Lacie laughing) - You know, I am not some naive freshman anymore. That stuff doesn't work on me. - Okay, well, what if I told you that we bought a foam machine and we are about to break it out. Not gonna lie, it's gonna get wild. (Lacie laughs) - Um, foam machine, wow. I would have to say, good luck with that. - Hey, did you sign up for this? - No, I wasn't sure it was for me. Why? - Because I signed up for it earlier this week. You should totally do it. A buddy of mine did a research study like this a few year ago, I guess they just had him play video games for like five straight days, and he earned two grand. Easy money. - Oh, sounds excruciating. (Killian chuckles) - I don't know about that. He was also saying that when he was there, like 90% of the time they just, you know, read books or-- - Played video games? - Or played video games. (both chuckling) So technically, you could get some studying done, and you could earn a few bucks. - Yeah, that doesn't sound bad. - No, not at all. - But uh, but what are they testing? - What do you mean? - I mean, it doesn't say what we're signing up for. - Yeah, I asked Clint about that too, and I guess it's not supposed to. Something about knowing what it is would attract a certain personality. This way it keeps it completely random. - Completely unbiased. That makes sense I guess. - Makes sense, yeah. (light knocking) - [Friend] Hey bro, hit or quit it. We're out of tequila and the ladies are getting restless. Let's go. - Wow, I am sorry about that. My friend is kind of, well, an ass. - It's okay, go, go, go, have sex with girls. (Killian laughs) - No, that's not, okay, I do have to go. Am I gonna see you later? - No, I can't. But um, but you put up a good fight. - Thank you. Well, if you change your mind, you know where we'll be. And you should seriously think about doing that. It would be nice to see you outside of the dorms for a change. - Okay, goodnight. - [Killian] Good night. - [Lacie] Have fun. - [Killian] Bye. (eerie music) (phone beeping) (phone ringing) - [Operator] Thank you for calling Systems of Science. Please leave a message after the beep. (phone beeps) - Hi, this is Lacie Donovan. I found your flyer on my campus, and I have a few questions for you. So, if you could call me back at your convenience, my number is 555-7178. Thanks so much, bye. (phone rings) Hello? - [Brian] Lacie Donovan. - May I ask who's calling? - [Brian] Yes, my name is Brian Nelson. I work for Systems of Science. You just left us a message. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that was me. - [Brian] Okay, good. I know this is last minute, but we're holding evaluations tomorrow at 4:00 p.m. Are you interested? - Yeah, absolutely. I'm off at work by then, so that's great. - [Brian] Excellent. If you give me your email address, we can send you all the information you're looking for. - [Brian] Okay, Ms. Donovan, the email has been sent. Good luck tomorrow. - [Lacie] Thank you. (tense music) - Right here. Right. Good. Open. Say ah. - Ah. - Ah. Good. Uh-huh. - [Lacie] Ah, it's cold. - Breathe deeply. Again. One more time. We, uh, need to draw some blood. We'll use this to test your red and white blood cell count, cholesterol, liver function, blood glucose levels, et cetera. We'll also know if you've taken any drugs, legal or otherwise. - Well, then it's a good thing I kicked my heroine addiction a few weeks ago. (giggles) - Drugs are not a laughing matter, Ms. Donovan. - Oh, no, I know. - Normally an assistant would do this, but she went home sick. Hold that. - Mm-hmm. - We're done here. We'll be evaluating your, your results over the next few days. No need to contact us with any questions. We'll call you if you're accepted. - Okay. - Uh-huh, good. Oh. Thank you, Ms. Donovan. - Thank you. (light knocking) - I think we're good. (slow suspenseful music) (phone rings) - I believe we've got our next group. - Good. Very good. Let's see to it that you don't fuck it up this time, okay? - You got it. Asshole. (Dr. Detrick laughing) - [Dr. Detrick] Asshole. (tense music) (phone ringing) - [Lacie] Hello. - [Brian] Lacie Donovan? - [Lacie] May I ask who's calling? - [Brian] This is Brian Nelson from Systems of Science. We spoke on the phone the other day. - [Lacie] Oh yeah. - [Brain] Congratulations, you've been accepted. We've emailed you the directions and everything you need to know. Please be there no later than 6:00 p.m. tomorrow. - [Lacie] Okay, thanks. - Hello. - [Lacie] Hi, um, I'm here for the test. I have this confirmation email. - Great. Yes, yes. How are you today? Did you have any trouble finding us? - Yeah, actually, I got really lost. I'm, I don't really come out this far normally. - Out here in the middle of nowhere. Why would you? - (chuckles) Good point. - Okay, let's see here now. There you are, Ms. Donovan I'm sure you already read this in the email, but I am required to tell you that there are no cell phones, laptops, or anything electronic on the premises. They tend to interfere with our equipment. - Oh yeah, that's okay. I didn't bring anything anyway. - [Receptionist] Great. Lacie, this is nurse Daphne. She's gonna go ahead and take you to your room. - Is she ready to go? - She's all yours. All right. Have a great time, Lacie. - Thank you so much. - All right, thank you. Bye bye. (scanner beeps) - Okay, what's with the smile? - It's nothing. - [Daphne] Not-uh, you can't be smiling like that about nothing. - Okay, well this is stupid, but um, when I was a little kid, I had this pet white mouse named Daphne. - Oh! - You know, from Scooby-Doo. We would just sit outside and talk for hours. - Aw, that's cute. - Yeah, but then she kind of sort of died tragically in an eighth grade science fair experiment. - [Daphne] Ew. - It's just that, I hadn't heard that name in a really, really long time. - Well, everything has to go sometime. However God sees fit, that's how I see it. - I guess. Is this it? - Mm-hmm, this is where you'll be staying for the next several days. - Looks just like home. (Daphne chuckles) - I'm sorry to have to do this, but I need to check your backpack for any electronic devices. It's company policy. - Oh yeah, that's fine. - [Daphne] All right. Pockets. - Uh, I. (Lacie chuckles) - All right, well, thanks for understanding. Go ahead and get settled in. There are scrubs on your bed. You should get changed and then head down to the cafeteria for a meet and greet. I believe most everyone is there already. It's around the corner on the left. - Okay, great, thank you so much. - All right. (slow suspenseful music) - Hey. - [Lacie] Oh hey. - How's it going? Are we supposed to wait here? - Oh no. No, I'm just standing here watching that bald, funny guy. But how's it going? - Awesome, I'm Carter. - [Lacie] Hey, Lacie. - Nice to meet you. This beautiful creature right here is my fiance, Amanda. - I want you right here, baby. - Ah, god, he's so inappropriate. It's really nice to meet you. - Hey, nice to meet you. - So, let's go man. - Yeah, let's go, yeah, let's go. - Let's go. (chuckles) - [Jake] Oh, I know this guy. - What's going on buddy? - Dude, what was it? Erectile dysfunction. - Yeah. - Yes. Yes, it's uh, it's Carter. - Got it. - Yeah, dude, what's up man? - Jake, right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Cool, man. - What's going on? - Not much dude. I'm glad to see you're still coming to these things, man. This is um, this is Amanda. Jake, Amanda. - Hello. - This is my fiance. - Hi. - Oh, pleasure to meet you. - It works. - Oh my god. Look at you, dude, last time I saw this guy, they gave us one of those limp dick pills that had us hard for like a month straight. We were like just clanging swords. - Not a month. - Fiance. - Come on. - He's got Excalibur down there. - Okay. - Congrats. - Thanks. - Let's sit down. - Come on, come on. - Yeah, that was awesome. Thank you. - Hey. - [Killian] Hey, it's about time you showed up. - How's it going? - How you doing? - Good. How are you? - Good, good. - [Lacie] Okay. - Well, look who decided to show up. - Hi, Killian, what's up? - Not much. So, now you telling me that you will drive to some god-forsaken facility in the middle of nowhere to see me, but you won't walk 50 feet down the hall? Now, what is up with that? - Well, I'm here now, right. - Yes, you are, and I'm glad you are. Did you get a chance to meet my buddy, Ty over here? - No. - [Killian] Ty, Lacie. - Hey, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. You guys know each other from school or something? - Yeah, we live in the dorms together. - [Ty] That's cute. - I'm telling you, she's always hitting on me, trying to take me to the bars and stuff, and I'm like Lacie, it's 10 in the morning. Let it go. - He's a liar. - Anyway, Lacie, I'd like you to meet Keisha. Keisha, Lacie. - What's up? - Nice to meet you. So, you guys came together? - What do you mean by that? Seriously, what do you mean by that? Did we come together? What, because we're black, we just automatically just come and go together? - What? - You, you speechless right now? I don't understand, what's going on? - [Lacie] You're serious. - Yeah, seriously, like yeah. That's what happened. Harriet Tubman just led us on the fucking Underground Railroad here, to this place right here. I don't understand what you mean by that? Why would you even ask us that? Seriously. I'm here to make a buck, just like you. No, no, don't. What the fuck is this shit. Lacie, seriously. Lacie. I'm completely fucking with you. (everyone laughing) - Oh my god. - Shit, fuck. - Oh my god, she's sweating. Do I look like that type? Now, I'm really offended, seriously. - [Lacie] Fuck you. - [Ty] You're killing me sweetheart. - I'm a really racist person too. - No, actually, Keisha and I just met like a minute before you walked in. - Oh, I'm an idiot, nice to meet you guys. - [Ty] No, no, I feel terrible. - No you don't. - Hey, hello lady. Why don't you come join us, come on. Come on. There you go. - See? - Hey! - [Jake] Yay! - Thanks. - So, so, what's your name? No, no, wait, let me guess. Sarah? - Noah. (all laughing) - You look like a Kelly kinda, yeah? - My name's Riley. - Riley. She's Korean. So, Riley, do you come to these things often? - So, did they give you those stupid pills at the last experiment? - Oh! - Ow. - Those pills. - Listen, listen. I'm just trying to impress her with my witty personality and my rugged good looks. (all chuckling) - It's fine, it's fine. As a attracted as I am to you, I found the flyer on my campus, and I thought it looked interesting, so I came. - Uh, where do you go to school? - I'm studying art at the Westlake branch. - Oh, cool, yeah, I'm at the main campus. - Do you like it? - Uh, it's okay, it's okay. I mean, it's, it's really expensive, so that's, that's kind of why I'm here. - I thought I was why you are here. (Lacie chuckling) - No, I'm not. Um, yeah. (all laughing) No, my mom, my mom is having a hard time, so just trying to help her out. So yeah, do you know that they're raising tuition next semester? - Actually, I didn't. My parents pay for school and pretty much everything else. So, I just come to these things to really piss them off. - Does it work? - Fucking yes. (all laughing) - Gentlemen, ladies. I hope everyone is well. My name is Sanders. - Dude, it's fucking Colonel Sanders. - Before we get started. - Shut up. - You're here because we're developing a new medicine for the military that will aid our soldiers in coping with anxiety on the battlefield. Now, it's very safe. At most you may feel euphoric, more anxious, nothing more. I just want you to know that you're doing your country a great service here today. - Listen, that is so cool about the soldiers and all. I mean, I feel you. But I'm here for the thousand bucks, man. (all chuckling) - Well, don't worry about that. You'll all be taken care of in good time. - Uh, what about dinner? - Will there be a secret blend of 11 herbs and spices? - Salads or like sides of any sort? - I understand you're all hungry from fasting today, and I apologize for that. We will be feeding you shortly, since it's important that you eat prior to the procedure. - Could have used a better word than procedure, don't you think? - Yeah, right. - In fact, a nurse should be in here any minute with your food. You can eat in here or in the rec room, which is just down the hall. Remember, what's most important is everyone relax, have fun. Before you know it, you'll all be out of here a thousand bucks richer. (all cheering) I, uh, almost forgot. The procedure starts tonight at 8:00 p.m. sharp. We'll call for you when we're ready. Be sure to drink lots of water. Have a good night. - Thank you. - All right, let's eat, yeah. - [Ty] Let's go. - You know, this isn't bad. No, it's not bad at all. - Are you serious? This makes me look forward to my diet of ramen noodles. - Mm, just be glad that they didn't serve the ravioli. My man Carter can back me up on that. - Yeah. You guys have no idea. It was like a piece of cardboard with snot wrapped on it and then tomato paste on top. - That's gross. - [Amanda] Oh my god. - No, he's right. He's exactly right. - Do you know what snot tastes like? (all snickering) - This actually tastes like my grandma's chicken. - [Jake] Really? - Well, that's not saying too much, she's um, she's starting to lose it, if you know what I mean. And she swears she's fine, but she recently invited my whole family over for Easter dinner in October, mind you. And she served us cat food and potato chips. Now, none of us had the heart to say anything, we just kept finding excuses to get up and throw the food in the garbage. - [Amanda] Oh, that's sad. - The worst part about it was that cat's been dead for years, so it's anybody's guess how long that food had been sitting around. I guess that's why I'm doing this. I'm gonna, I'm gonna take the money that I make from this and use it to fly her back to Ireland before, well before she-- - Before she invites everyone over for Christmas dinner? (all laughing) - What about everybody else? I mean, what are you guys gonna do with the money? - I think I'm gonna fly home to see my mom. She's been really lonely since my dad left, so. I don't know, I found that as I get farther and farther along in school, I have less time and less money, so. Hey Jake, can you hand me the blanket? It's kind of cold. - Yeah. Yeah, I mean, dude, I don't know. I mean, my rent's due, but I don't know how I'm gonna pay for it, considering I'm gonna blow this money on a giant TV. - Awesome. - Nice. - I cannot wait to play my Xbox 360 in glorious high definition. - I'm glad you got your priorities straight. - Oh hell yeah. Shit, I mean, even if I get evicted, I can still snuggle up with that TV. - I like that my fiance finds this amusing. - Yeah, odd couple. - Straight priorities too, apparently. - What are you guys gonna be spending, spending your cash on? - Well, we're saving up for the wedding and the honeymoon. - Yeah, we're gonna go to Vegas. We've never been to Vegas. Never done the whole casino thing. So you know, kind of a one shot deal. Maybe get Elvis up in there. - Come on, hey guys, guys, come on. There's children around here. - So, Keisha, what are your plans with the money? - No disrespect, but you guys are really willing to risk your health and wellbeing for what? A television or a flight home? To me, that's ridiculous. I don't know. - All right, well, what makes you different? - Well, four months ago, I got laid off because of cutbacks and unemployment ran out and reality sank in. This for you guys is a choice. But me, it's my only option. - I'm sorry to hear that. - Well, look on the bright side, at least the food's good. (all laughing) - Amen girl. Amen. - So, um, Ty, I'm sure you got somewhere else to be besides this lame hospital. - Well, it's funny you should ask. - [Woman] Attention, attention, it is now 7:50. Test subjects need to report. Please get there immediately. Thank you. - First procedure, and then test subjects. What have you gotten me into? - (chuckles) A weekend with me. - Yeah, and six strangers in a creepy hospital. How romantic. - We'll probably be great. - Test subjects, let's go. - [Carter] I guess. - Good, 'cause I don't want to pick up. (Carter chuckles) - Hey, I'll meet up with you guys in a sec, okay. (eerie music) (heavy breathing) - [Man] Hey, get the fuck out of here. (Lacie gasps) (tense music) - You're not supposed to be here. - Nice. - [Lacie] Thank you. - What did you do out there? Nurse Ratchet looked mean. - She has that effect on people. (Jake laughing) - I feel embarrassed. - How dare you. Naughty. - This is kind of a shady place. - Yeah. - I like it though. - Yeah, it's weird. - You would like it. - So, what's up with like the one nail? - Oh, you know, just a fashion statement, you know. - Oh. - What's up with the head though? - Well, that's, a total fashion statement. - All right. - Yeah. Shiny. - It's kind of cute. - And beautiful. - Shave that thing. - Aerodynamic. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Like that? Like that? (tense music) - [Daphne] Amanda, please come with me. - Um, do I really have to be first? - [Daphne] Amanda, you need to come with me now. (Amanda sighs) - Everything will be okay, baby. It'll be over before you know it. - Are you sure? - [Carter] Yeah. - Do you promise? - [Carter] Yeah. - Say it. - I promise, baby. - Okay. - [Carter] You good? - Yeah. I love you. - I love you too, baby. And I'll see you real soon, okay? - Okay. (Carter sighs) - So, a priest and a lawyer are walking down the street, they come across this playground. The priest turns to the lawyer, says, hey, you want to fuck some kids? The lawyer says sure, but out of what? (all chuckle) Ba dum cha. - You know, you really should stop doing these tests. They're starting to effect your intelligence and tact. - Come on, come on, that was funny. - No. - That was funny. - [Keisha] No, it wasn't. - All right, all right, try this one. So, a guy walks out of a bathroom naked. He's got, he's got a poodle under one arm, he's got 50 feet of duct tape under the other. - [Daphne] Ty, come with me. - Let's get this shit over with. (somber music) (clock ticking) - [Daphne] Jake. Riley. Keisha. Carter. - Where is everyone? Shouldn't they be done by now? - Well, they're probably just waiting for us back in the rec room. Right? - I don't know, maybe. But there's something really weird about this place. I saw Sanders wearing one of those masks. - What kind of masks? - The masks you see in the movies when something really bad is about to happen. - [Daphne] Killian, please come with me. (Killian sighs) - [Killian] Hang in there, okay? You're gonna be all right. - [Daphne] Lacie, please come with me. (suspenseful music) After you. - Hey, hey. Hey. Let me out. Hey! Let me out! Hey! Please let me out. Please! Please. (Lacie whimpering) - Release the gas. (gas hissing) (Lacie panting) (Lacie coughing) (Lacie screams) (Lacie sobbing) (Lacie panting) (Lacie screaming) (Lacie panting) All right, call in a crew, let's get outta here. - All right then, come and get her. (slow suspenseful music) Are you recording? - Standby. - Everything's set up correctly? - Everything is good. - Senator, are you getting our feed? - Everything looks good on my end. I want updates with each new development. - All right, we are recording. (camera whirring) (Amanda gasping) - Carter? Carter? (Amanda groans) Carter? (Amanda sighs) (door creaks) (eerie music) (Carter groaning) - Hey, baby. - Hey. How are you? - I'm good. Mm, you smell good. - I always smell good. - Yeah. (Carter sighs) - [Amanda] I want you inside me. - Now? - Yeah, now. Take off my shirt. Come on. (slow suspenseful music) Take yours off. - Oh, baby. - Take off my pants. - You take off my pants. (both laughing) (Carter moaning) (Amanda panting) - Mm. (both moaning) Pull my fucking hair. Mm. Pull it harder. (Carter panting) Oh! - Oh fuck. - [Amanda] What's the matter? - [Carter] Baby. - Is that my hair? What the fuck? What's going on? - Baby, what is going on? (Amanda panting) (tense music) (Amanda groans) Baby. Fuck. Oh my god. Oh fuck. Amanda. Amanda. Baby. Whats' going on? (suspenseful music) - What's happening to me? Oh. Oh, Carter. My hair. Carter. (Amanda sobbing) Carter. Carter! - [Carter] Whoa. (water trickling) (tense music) - [Amanda] You did this to me. - What? (Amanda screams) (Carter screaming) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (Lacie gasps) (Lacie panting) - Hello? Hello? Hello? (clock ticking) Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Hello? Seriously guys, this isn't funny. - Lacie. - Hey. - What's with all the yelling? - No one is here, Killian, everyone is gone. - [Killian] Wait, what do you mean no one's here? - I, I can't find any of the doctors or nurses, and every single door I checked is locked. I just-- - Well, it's still early. - No, that's the thing. There's one clock that says it's like 11:15 and another one that says it's like four. - Okay, okay, okay, calm down. There's got to be a good explanation for this. Let's um, let's just look around and see if we can find anyone else who's awake, okay? - Okay. - [Killian] Okay. - What time is it? - I'm sorry to wake you. - [Lacie] Hey Riley, I'm sorry to wake you up, but. - Just bear with us. Lacie seems to think that there's something wrong. - We can't find anyone. Kind of weird, so, do you want to just meet me outside? - Now? - Yeah, now. - Like right now? - Would you mind? - Sure, just give me a minute, okay. - Okay, thanks. - I'll be right out. - [Killian] Okay. - See you outside. - Okay. - Thanks. Anything? - No. - [Lacie] Told you. - Jesus Christ, I'm so freaking tired right now. - Me too. - So, what's going on, why are we here? Why we up so early? - There's no one here. Everybody is gone. - What's she talking about? - Well, what Lacie is trying to say is that none of us can seem to find any of the doctors or nurses and she's, well, we're all a little concerned. That's all. - No, no, no, no. What I'm saying is that something is very wrong here. - Seriously? That's what you woke us up for? I'm going back to bed. - [Killian] Ty, just hang on. - No, you don't get it. There is nobody here. There is no way out. Everyone is gone. All the doors are locked. - So then, where's the honeymooners? - I checked their rooms. We don't know where they are. - Probably just fucking on some gurney somewhere. (Ty groans) I'm sorry, they're probably making love on some gurney somewhere. - Or they're probably having breakfast with the doctors and nurses. - No, no, you guys, I'm telling you-- - But since we're all up, we might as well go look for them, okay? So, you three go that way, and we'll go this way, and we're bound to run into 'em. Good? - Okay. - Sounds good. (tense music) Carter. Amanda. It is awfully quiet. I mean, someone should be here, right? - See, I told you. - You know, this reminds me. I was doing one of these a couple of years ago. Couldn't find this guy for like two days. - Seriously? - Yeah, yeah. It ended up, he was underneath his bed, like just paralyzed, locked with fear. Essentially, the guy was having nightmares, but he was like fully awake. - What the fuck were you guys testing? - Let's just say it's a drink that gives you a lot of energy. - Really? - Yeah. - Which one? - A very popular one. - What is that? (slow suspenseful music) What the? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, dude, dude, you don't, you don't want to go in there. - Well, what if they're hurt? All right, what if they need our help? - After you. Whoa, whoa, Lacie, Lacie, whoa, don't. Shit. - Oh. Carter. Amanda, is anyone in here? - Oh god! - [Killian] Lacie. (Carter gasping) (Carter screaming) (Jake retching) - Carter. (Carter growling) (Jake panting) Dude, we gotta go. - What is it? - We gotta go. - We gotta fucking go, dude. - What is it? What did you see? - It's Carter! It's fucking Carter in there, man, but, but it's, but it's, it's not him. It's no, no, no. Don't, don't go in there. Okay, okay. Trust me on this, okay? Let's just find everyone, we'll just get out. - Okay. - Okay? - Okay, okay. - Okay? Come on, come on! - Come on. - [Jake] Go, go, go. Go, go, go! No time to explain, we gotta get the hell out of here. Let's go, let's go. Go, go. (suspenseful music) - Damn it, damn it. You need the security card to get in. - [Killian] Okay, let me try. (Killian groaning) Shit. - Okay, um, well, what about the stairs. - We tried them all, they're all locked. - Will someone care to tell me why the hell are we running? And what exactly is going on? - Carter's dead, man. - [Keisha] What about Amanda? - He's fucking, Carter is fucking dead, did you hear me? Fucking, someone tore him apart and left him for dead. I don't know, he was, he was still alive. I saw him, but I don't know exactly what I saw. - What about Amanda? - We don't know. Look, there's got to be a phone or something, right? - We tried them all. They're all dead. (Jake panting) - This is just fucking great. This is great, we're trapped in here with no way out. Everyone's gone except for us. None of the phones work. And Carter's dead. You know what this is? This is fucked, man, this is completely fucked! - Calm down, all right? There's gotta be another way out of here. - Really? - I got a phone. - You mean like a cellphone? - Yeah, I snuck it in when I came. - Why didn't you say so? - Can we go? - Go, go, go! - Go! - Go, go! - Don't stop! - You guys hungry at all? 'Cause I am starving. I'm thinking pizza, maybe some peperoni. Or we could do vegetarian if that's your thing. - Bring up camera 12, and 17 over here. - Fine. Just, I've got a very high metabol, you know what, fuck it. You don't give a shit. - Hold on, I'm gonna go get it. (Riley panting) (Ty and Lacie panting) (tense music) - Guys. Is that Amanda? - Amanda, is that you? I got a bad feeling about this. - What is she standing there for? - I got it. - [Ty] Keisha, Keisha, run. Run, Run! (Keisha screams) (dramatic music) - [Ty] Hey, hey, don't, what are you doing, man? We gotta get her. - It's too late, man. - No, no! - It's too late, there's no time! - What the fuck are you doing? - This shit ain't over, man. - Come on. - It's locked. It's too late, it's too late. - [Thank you] Are you kidding me, man, listen to her. What the fuck is wrong with you? Come on. (tense music) - [Killian] Oh shit. (all panting) Oh shit. - What the fuck, man, we could have saved her. - Ty, it was too great a risk, man. There's nothing we could have done. - You mean there's nothing you could have done. - Ty, you need to calm down, right. This isn't gonna help anything. This isn't gonna change anything. - Let me tell you something. This thing between you and me, it ain't over. (dramatic music) - Shouldn't have brought your cell phone, huh? (phone ringing) Guys. - Pick it up. - Here it is. - Progress report, gentlemen. Are we ready to execute or not? - No sir, but we have made quite a bit of progress. The subjects are still exhibiting various symptoms such as trouble breathing, hair loss, and bleeding from various orifices. But the good news is that the chemical is taking effect much more rapidly. We also believe that we do in fact have a fully functional counter agent. - How so? - We inoculated two of the subjects prior to being exposed to the gas. So far, both subjects are symptom free. - And they're both still alive? - Not exactly. One of them has unfortunately expired sooner than we hoped. - If you had kept them isolated like I suggested, we wouldn't be talking about this issue right now, would we? - Sir. - It's, it's important that the subjects remained together. Physical interaction and conversion are important and necessary, keeping the mind busy. If we separate them, we risk the possibility-- - Dr. Detrick, yes. Yes, how long before you're ready to start manufacturing the agent? - We're certainly close, sir. Could be ready within a matter of weeks. - I beg your pardon, did you say could? - Will, (chuckles) will. It will be ready, sir. - Good. (slow suspenseful music) - Christ sake. - I don't know if that thing was Amanda, but whatever it is might come back. - The barricade's solid. Nothing's getting in. - I don't suppose that gate opens, does it? - No, I already checked. You need a key. How are you holding up, baby? - Why are they doing this to us? (suspenseful music) - Uh-huh. No, no, there's no way, man. That thing was moving way too fast. I mean, this must be something completely different. - Brilliant insight, Jake. Okay, now that we're clear on what actually constitutes as a zombie, we need to-- - Do you guys think that we're gonna turn into those things? I mean, seriously you guys, what was in that gas? - Look, I think we need to stop hypothesizing and actually start to think of some kind of plan. - Hey, check out those cameras. They, mm-mm, they weren't here before, which means someone's watching us. Hello. Hello. We need some help please. Hello? - Will you please turn that off. - We need help, someone. (suspenseful music) Fuck it. (static buzzing) - Uh-oh. - I thought you said they were shatter proof. - Hopefully, it's still under warranty because I'm pretty sure we don't have the extended service plan. - This isn't the time. I don't know how, but fix it. Do we have another camera in that room? - Of course, it's coming up right now, Jesus. And there it is. (Sanders sighs) - [Killian] What are you doing? - You know what, if they want us, they can come and get us. I don't know about you, but I am not going to die here. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. You all right, you all right? - Yeah. - You okay? - Yeah, yeah. It must have been the chicken, right? (Ty coughing) - Should one of us go check on him? - He's fine. - Listen, I think Ty's gone off the reservation, man. - I can hear you, asshole. Okay hotshot, you got us locked in this room. What next? Huh? Tell me there's something more to all this. Tell us all what the fuck you plan to do if that thing comes back. - I don't know. - What? - [Killian] I said I don't know. - Hey, I don't see you coming up with a better idea. Okay, so while you sit over there in the corner, at least he is doing something. Killian's gotten us this far, so if you don't have anything constructive to say, then why don't you just back off. (Jake snickers) - You got something you want to say, funny man? - No, no. - That's what I thought. - Check out the balls on Lacie. - Shut up, Jake. - Guys, guys, seriously, we need a legitimate plan. - Sooner or later, someone's gonna come looking for us, right? As long as that thing's out there and we're in here, we're safe. All right, so let's just sit tight, relax, wait this thing out. - No way. What about food? Or going to the bathroom? I mean, you guys, it feels like I haven't eaten in days. - Yeah, I mean, for all we know it could have been days. - Maybe we should try to get Keisha's cellphone. - That's a good idea. Yeah. Yeah, we'll just go out in the hallway there. We'll hang out with whatever that thing is. You know, it's probably just waiting around the corner for us. - It was just an idea. - No, I think it's worth a shot. I mean, we can't stay here forever. - You know what, my ass is staying right here. - That's very noble of you, Jake. - You know, chivalry died with women's lib, all right? I'm all for equal rights, ladies. - I can do it. Seriously, I'm the smallest one here. You guys can move the vending machine a couple of inches. I'll squeeze through, I'll get the phone, and we're done. - You're serious? - Yeah. - You sure you want to do this? - Yes, I'm sure. Let's go. Come on. - Okay, okay. Let's do this. Ready? On the count of three, one, two, three. (slow suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (Riley screaming) (Riley panting) - [Riley] I got it. - Does it work? - Yeah. Oh shit. - What? - There's no signal. (phone beeping) Hey. - Fucking bullshit. Excellent idea. - Get it off my hands, get it off my hands. Get this shit off my hands, get it off my hands. Get it, no, no, I need to get this off right now. You don't understand, no, no, get this off of me! - Calm down, calm down, breathe, breathe, breathe. Just breathe, just breathe, all right. Just breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, okay? - We need to face reality and assume that no one is coming for us. - You don't know that. - Jake. Jake, think about the people who are operating this, okay? They kidnapped us. They held us against our will. Okay, they pumped us full of god knows what. They have everything to loose, so they're going to do whatever it takes to keep us here. We can't just wait around here. We need to find a way out. - What do you propose we do? Huh? Walk out the front door? - Okay, we're on the top floor. We can't go down, so we need to find a way to the roof, okay? And then from there, we can see if we get a signal. - Or use the fire escape. - If there is one. - [Killian] Right, if there is one. - The roof is our best bet. Do, do you agree? - Yeah, I think that's our best option given the circumstances. Riley? - Yeah, I agree. - All right, and how do you propose we get to the roof? (tense music) - What about the air ducts? - [Jake] What? - You know what, she's right. In buildings like this, the air conditioning units usually are located on the roof. - Okay, okay. Okay, so we find a way to the air ducts and then, and then we get to the roof. Right? - You think it'll work? - The air ducts should be big enough. - There's an air duct in the rec room. - [Killian] Okay, are you sure about that? - Yeah, absolutely. - All right. Then we make our way to the rec room. We use the air duct, and we should be golden. - Listen, I, I hate to be Debbie Downer on this, all right, but you guys remember that thing's still out there. - [Ty] Even if we make it to the roof, what then? - You know what Ty, you contributed exactly two things today. Jack and shit. So, here's your chance pal. We're all listening, we're all here. Enlighten us. (Ty retching) - Fuck. It's throwing me. - Dude, I don't think that's normal. - Ty. - Run. - Shit! - Ty! - Come on, come on, come on. - Run! (Lacie screaming) - [Killian] Go, go, go, go, go! (Killian and Ty grunting) (dramatic music) (glass clattering) (Killian groaning) - God. - No. - No! - No! - I have to go back. - He's gone, he's gone. (Ty pants) (Riley screams) (Ty panting) (Ty grunts) (dramatic music) (Jake screaming) - [Ty] Where are you? Huh? (all panting) - Okay. I think we're good, come on. - Guys, guys, guys, guys. Look where we're at. - It's the waiting room. - Jake, no. - Yeah. Yeah, we gotta at least look. - No, no, that's a horrible idea. - What? - No, no, no, come on. Come on. - Jake. - [Jake] Come on. - [Lacie] Goddammit. - [Riley] I don't understand what's going on you guys. - I hope I didn't miss anything tasty. Now, this is interesting. (slow suspenseful music) (glass clattering) - So, they were watching us this whole time. How did you know that they would be watching? - Well, I've been doing enough of these things to know that there is always someone watching. Maybe now I can get some answers. Come on. (slow suspenseful music) Come on. Okay. There's not a goddamned thing. I thought we'd find something, anything. It's nothing. - It's okay, it's not a big deal. We just start it-- - No, no, no, it's not okay. We may be turning into one of those things out there that's chasing us. I say we're anything but okay. - Jake, calm down. - I'm sorry. - It's fine, it's just you're not the only one who's dealing with this. We all are, so let's stick together. - You're right. You're right. - Okay. Okay, the important thing is we keep moving, so let's, let's get to the rec room and just get the fuck out of here, okay? - Okay. Okay. (dramatic music) (Ty panting) - Should I call in a cleanup crew? - Put 'em on standby. Let 'em know we'll need 'em soon. You take care of their cars yet? - All good. - How we doing otherwise, anything else to report? - You missed it, they broke into the lab. - Really? - See for yourself. - It's over there. - Uh, I'll find something to block the door. Get this vent off. (grate clanging) (slow suspenseful music) I think we're okay. Okay, all right? All right, you ready? - Yeah. - Okay. (Lacie grunting) (Lacie panting) (Lacie coughing) Okay, come on. - Wait, what about you? - Don't worry, I'll be right behind you, don't worry about me. Go, go. (Riley screams) (dramatic music) (Ty panting) Shit. (Ty screaming) - Not so funny now, are you? (Ty grunting) - Where? - Right there. (tense music) - As I was saying Colonel, I expect a full report on my desk at the end of the week. Anything else? - Cleanup crew will be here shortly. We're about ready to wrap it up. - Perfect. I'll handle the local press. Our cover story runs day after tomorrow. - We'll be long gone by then. - Excellent, gentlemen, you've done your country a great service today. - [Sanders] Thank you, sir. (dramatic music) (Jake panting) (Ty grunts) (Jake groaning) (Jake panting) (Ty grunting) (Jake groans) (Riley screams) (Ty groaning) (suspenseful music) (Jake coughing) (Riley coughing) - Hey, you okay? (dramatic music) (Riley groans) - Jake? Riley? Where are you? (suspenseful music) Help. Help! Damn it. (engine rumbling) - [Soldier] Go! - Help! Help! Jake. (gun fires) - Do you understand that time is an issue? That we're under contract to deliver this weapon and that, and that the results are far from what the Senator wants? - Would you stop worrying? We have plenty of time, despite what he thinks. Now, don't give me that look. This is a small price to pay for progress. - Really? - We're doing a good thing, and when we're done here, an American casualty will be a thing of the past. No more taking an enemy head on. We'll release this gas on whomever we want and simply let them kill themselves. No virus, no hole in the ground, no connection to the U.S. - Do you really believe that? - [Sanders] I sleep quite well at night, my friend. - Well, I don't. - Tough. 'Cause we're not done till we have a weapon that leaves no visible symptoms. (Lacie grunts) (soldier screaming) (gun firing) What the fuck is going on out there? - [Soldier] We have a man down, man down. (gun firing) (gun fires) - We need to be more careful. Things are getting out of control. - Are you kidding? This was nothing. You're lucky you weren't around when we were developing AIDS. Our initial results were ungodly to say the least. (soldier groaning) (gun firing) (tense music) - South wing clear, moving forward. (somber music) (fire crackling) (tense music) - [Sanders] You about done? - Just finished. - [Sanders] Good, the truck's loaded and ready to go. (slow suspenseful music) - Mr. Vice President, everything went as planned. Yes, sir. We are almost ready to launch a live field test. Yes, sir. No, no, no, thank you, sir. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (somber music) (tense music) (MultiCom Jingle)
