Are you really going to be all right? I know you're moving for your sake, but wouldn't it be better to leave your morn in our hands? So-Jung Mt. Jang is her hometown, so I'm hoping she'll get better there. I heard some people got better that way. I wouldn't ask for anything more...

How can he be here? He disappeared in Seoul. He could be here to look for your father. His grandpa lived here. Hee-yeon. Honey. Don't be like that. Please, can we try looking again? It has already been five years. You promised me. Then do we just forget about him? Do we wipe him from our memory? The cops are looking into it. You know that's bullshit! You know it too, don't you? We ended up like this because of them! And Jun-hee? What about our daughter? Are we going to leave her alone again? Without Dad, no one can look after her. I'll go to the station soon and ask them to continue the search. Okay? PLEASE HELP US FIND OUR SON JUN-SUH Do you need help? This is our puppy. I see, you mistook Mong for Ttotti. PLEASE HELP US FIND TTOTTI I'm sure Ttotti will know that you're looking for him and that you still remember him. So, don't give up. Just keep looking. Okay? Okay? Hey! What are you doing? Sister. It's Ttotti. WARNING RESTRICTED AREA MT. JANG CAVE Ttotti? Ttotti? Ttotti! Ttotti! Sister, are you okay? It's too dark to see anything. Sister! Sister! Sister! Hurry. Sister. There's nothing here.

Sorry for the wait. I'm Detective Park Chung-sik. I was told that you two found her first. Yes. Could you tell me what happened? What? Are you telling us to repeat our statement? Yes, ma'am. Do you know how many times we have repeated it already? Is this how you work? I think there's been... What about the girl? Did you find her? What girl? I said there was a girl wandering around here. Was there a girl? Forget it, we'll look for her. Ma'am, once the crime scene is... Forget it! You'll just say you did your best, like you always do. Let's go, honey. Wait. Contact us if you have questions. Okay. I don't believe this. My goodness! Where were you? I was so worried. Are you okay? Come inside, okay? Come in. Honey? Honey, look at her. Are you okay? How did she find us? Where do you live? Did you get lost? Honey, let her sleep here tonight. These are all the cases related to the cave. All of them? Yes. Most of them are missing person cases. Apparently, all of them said similar things before they went missing. That they heard voices. HEARD VOICES OF DEAD SIBLINGS HE SPOKE WITH HIS DEAD FATHER They said they heard deceased friends or family members calling them, asking them to come to the cave. Scary, isn't it? PHOTOS OF CRIME SCENE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF MISSING PERSON Can I come in? Do you need some help? Sorry. Mom, I can't find the pillow. Is it not in the closet? No. Wash yourself for a bit. I bet you didn't even look for it properly. It's really not there. All right, I believe you. Mom, mine is too big for her. You're right. What should we do? PARK JUN-SUH JUN-SUH'S BABY DIARY Where did you get it? It fits perfectly! Mom, why can't she talk? I'm not sure. How old is she? Where did she come from? Maybe she leaves nearby? I hope she lives near, right, Mom? Mom! She can talk. Mom. Sweetie, what's your name? Your name, what is it? Tell me. Jun-hee. I'm Jun-hee. Jun-hee? I'm Jun-hee too, Park Jun-hee. Really? It's three to one. Mom won this time. Three to one. I'm so bad at this. Eat. Eat. My morn cooks well. My mom cooks well. I'm Jun-hee. I'm Jun-hee. I'm Jun-hee too. I'm Jun-hee too. Park Jun-hee. Jun-hee, are you still up? Oh, it's you. It's late. Go to sleep now. Okay, good night. Good night. Mom. Mom. Mom. You too? What? Yes, my eyes feel weird. Is it an infection? By the way, did you give that girl the clothes she's wearing? Yes. Why? No, nothing. Excuse me. Who are you? It's dangerous. Pardon? The cave has opened up. I can hear the voices again. Leave this place at once! Dad, he's only chasing me! Dad! Dad! He really loves treats. Jun-hee, you're in a good mood today. Yes, I'm happy. It's not your first time feeding him, though. I'll feed him every day! Jun-suh? Dad, can I give him more? Sure. Dad, he waggles his tail when I mention treats. DETECTIVE TEAM 1 Are you Mr. Choi Jung-su? What? Please sit down. Sorry for asking you to come so late. Do you own a Sonata with the plate number 42G8202? Your vehicle was found near Mt. Jang. Take a look. My vision is... Is this your car? Yes, it is. How do you know Ms. Yoon Min-ji? She was found inside a closed down cave. She was found dead. When did you last see her? How do you know her? Mr. Choi? Sir? Honey, help me. Baby. Help me! Come and get me, I'm in the cave. Please come faster. Please come faster! Don't go... Please... Snap out of it. Honey. Honey, help me... Help me! Soon-ja. It's me, your brother. Jun-hee, let's go. I'll be right there! About that girl... Girl? Jun-hee? Not Jun-hee, the kid. Yes, Jun-hee. Is her name Jun-hee too? Isn't it weird? Her voice sounds like Jun-hee, too. All kids sound similar. Did you call the police? Police? Didn't you report it? No, not yet. Really? Take her to the station right away. Why? Is there something wrong? No, but she should be stable... What are you talking about? Imagine her parents. They must be worried sick. It would be wrong of us. Dad! Get her to the police station, we can't keep her here. Okay. Let's go, Dad. Okay. Make sure you go today, okay? Soon-ja. It's me, your brother. Come here, I'm right here. We can go home now. Let's go home. It's been hard. We can be together now. Let's go home, Soon-ja. This is our home. Come here. Jun-hee? Jun-hee? Jun-hee? Are you sleeping? Are you sleeping? Jun-hee! What are you doing here? Come out. Come here. Jun-hee, why were you hiding in here? You can tell me. What's wrong? Mother! Mother, what's wrong with you? Get away! Jun-hee, run! It's not him! It's not my brother. It's not him! Please stop! Mother! It's not him... It's not him... It's not him... Jun-hee. Jun-hee, come here. It's okay. You can trust me. Don't be scared. Trust me. Mom. I know. It must have been hard. It must have been so hard since you left home. I know, baby. I'm sorry. Mom is sorry, I really am. Let's go. It's not him. Mom. Mom, did you do this? She spat out her pills. I should've checked. This isn't working outwith Mom. We can't take care of her on our own. Let's move her to the nursing home. I called So-Jung already. I'll do better. Hee-yeon. You know very well that she's our last hope. Honey. Do you still believe that? Mom! Why are you still up? I can't sleep. Is that so? Let's go back to your room. I'll stay with you until you fall asleep. Dad, good night. Mom. Who's Jun-suh? Where did you hear that name? You kept calling his name. In your sleep. He's Jun-hee's brother. My brother? Yes, your brother. Where is he now? I don't know. Where could he be? You don't know? No-. Grandma might know, but she can't talk. Why? Because Grandma is sick. That's why she can't remember anything. What are you doing? What's going on? What about you? What did I do? I'm talking about that kid! Jun-hee? I doubt she's Jun-hee. What do you mean? Forget it. Just take her to the police station tomorrow. That's not the problem right now. Don't you know what happened today? That's why I want Mom in the nursing home. You can't handle it all by yourself. How can you manage Mom and Jun-hee? Why is everything so easy to you? What? You want to send Jun-hee and Mother away. Is that what you want? To send everyone away? But that's... Do you ever think about Jun-suh? Your son. Our son Jun-suh! I'm reminded of him when I look at that girl. He could be out there needing someone's help. Hee-yeon! I can't give up on him! I'm going to keep searching for him! I can't... I can't give up on him. No, I won't. Stay here alone if you want! I'm going to look after Mother! I'll call the detectives again! I'm going back to Seoul. Mom. I'll put up the flyers again. He's out there! Stop it. Please stop! Honey, that's enough! Just stop it already! Hee-yeon. Jun-suh... About Jun-suh... Our Jun-suh... He's dead. We have to believe that. Let him go. We can't go on like this. Let our boy go. Soon-ja. Soon-ja, come here. I'm right here. My brother is dead. What do you mean? I'm still alive. I'm here. Sister! Come to me. That's not our brother. Sister, let's go home! Let's go home! This is our home. Soon-ja. Sister! I'm with our brother. I missed you. Sister, I missed you so much! Soon-ja. I know it's tough there. I missed you. Come over. Soon-ja, this is our home. Sister! Soon-ja, come here. Soon-ja, what took you so long? Soon-ja. Take me with you. Soon-ja. I want to be with you. Grandma! Mother? Grandma! Mom! Do you know where Grandma went? I couldn't reach my husband all day. I think something happened to him while looking for his mother. This town... This town feels a bit strange. How come? I'm not saying this because of my husband and his mother. There were those two kids looking for a dog. And Jun-hee. I think her parents lost her here. What girl? Do you remember that girl I mentioned? The one I asked you to look for? Yes. We found her near the house that night, so we've been keeping her with us. Can you run her through the database? Yes, sir. Ma'am, can I speak to that girl? Jun-hee? She was right here. Jun-hee? Jun-hee? Mom. Jun-hee! Have you seen Jun-hee? Jun-hee, the little girl. No one by the name Jun-hee was reported missing in the last few years. How did she look? She's a bit smaller than my daughter and has a bob cut. She was wearing a pink dress. Don't worry, ma'am. We'll do our best to find him. I'm new here, so I wasn't aware, but there have been a lot of missing persons cases here. Just like you mentioned. There were also a few statements about that girl. Yes, this is her. What is it? The photo is not from a recent case. It's from the 80s. That can't be. Jun-hee! Jun-hee! QUESTION: WHO IS THE GIRL? ANSWER: I DON'T KNOW. QUESTION: ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY ABOUT THE GIRL? ANSWER: SHE NEVER TALKED TO ME. Jun-hee! Jun-hee! ANSWER: HE SAID THE GIRL ASKED HIM TO COME... Jun-hee! It's called the Mt. Jang Tiger. It's a local folktale ghost. It mimics the human voice and bewitches people. There were a few shamans here who sewed me “get. That shaman also served it when he moved here. He was a nobody before, but it all changed once he started serving it. He was chosen by the tiger. Honey! Help! Honey! Come here! Please help! It's a ghost! Honey. Honey! Honey? Honey! The shaman had a daughter Honey! Who had a great aura. She endured her father's abuse, and waited for her mom to come back. Did you miss me? I told you I'd come back soon. I'll be with you forever. Mom. Mom. The tiger slowly began to take over the shaman's soul. But it wasn't satisfied. It wanted a purer and stronger energy. The two of them disappeared. They probably became servants of the tiger. That's when people started disappearing. They were most likely sacrificed to the tiger. The girl had stronger energy. When she breaks the chi, the shaman will appear. If you see the girl, you'll see the shaman soon. But she's... Don't trust her, ever. They'll use everything at their disposal. Guilt, anger and even longing. They'll exploit your vulnerabilities. How are your eyes? What? As your chi weakens, you'll have trouble seeing. Hang this at home. It will ward them off temporarily. Leave now. The longer you stay, the more dangerous it'll get. Jun-hee! Mom? Mom, something is wrong with my eyes. Mom? Jun-hee, come here. We have to leave! Mom? Baby, come to me. Come here! Sweetie, stay there for a bit. It's dangerous outside. I'll be right there! Jun-hee! Jun-hee! Jun-hee! Jun-hee. Jun-hee, are you there? Jun-hee. Jun-hee, come here. Come on out. We have to get out of here. Jun-hee, come here. It's all right. You can trust me. Look at my eyes. Don't be scared. Jun-hee, trust me. Let's go, okay? Jun-hee! Jun-hee. Jun-hee... Jun-hee! Jun-hee! Mom, Jun-hee saved me. Is there any way to save those who disappeared? The cave is the tiger's territory. The child is the only one who knows the way. Hey. What's your name? Be honest with me. Are you really Jun-hee? Jun-hee. Do you know where my husband and Grandma are? Did they go to the cave? If we go there, can you take me to them? What is it? Is it because of your dad? Mom, will you protect me? You promise you won't leave? What's your favorite fairy tale? Sun and Moon. Right, Sun and Moon. You're going to become a part of Sun and Moon. A tiger will mimic me to eat you from outside the door. What did the Sun ask? “Show me your hand.” So, should you believe it because you hear my voice? No. Good. Don't trust anyone, got it? If... DETECTIVE KIM JIN-YEONG If I'm not here tomorrow, call this policeman. Mom. You shouldn't make any sound. Don't ever reply to any voice. Who is it? Hee-yeon? Is that you? Are you there? Hello? Is someone there? I can't see, can you help me? Mom? I followed you here and got lost. I don't know where I am. Jun-hee? Is that you? Mom. Is your mom there? Hee-yeon, is that you? I don't know where I am. I can't see anything! Hee-yeon. Where are you? I fell down. Now I can't see! Mom, where are you? Hee-yeon, don't listen to that voice! It could be that girl! Don't believe her, I followed her here. Hee-yeon, can you hear me? Mom! There's a weird man here! He's coming at me! Jun-hee! Jun-hee? Jun-hee? Mom! Mom! Mom! Honey, why are you hiding? Come out. Hee-yeon. It's your fault, you did this! Why do you blame my mom? You're his mom! Why do you blame me for Jun-suh? It's your fault! He disappeared because of you! What will you do? Come here, Hee-yeon. I'm here. What will you do? Mom, come here. Hee-yeon. Come here. Hee-yeon. Hee-yeon. What do we do? Then do we just forget about him? Mom! You didn't listen to me. I took care of your sick mother... I won't give up. Please, Hee-yeon. Hee-yeon, are you there? Our Jun-suh, he's dead. We have to believe that. I'm so sorry, Jun-suh. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Honey, I'm right here. Come here. Come to me. I know you're tired. Let's get some rest. You did everything you could. Come to me. Hee-yeon! Move! Are you okay? I'm fine. Look up, there should be a hole. Can you get up there? I fell from there. What about you? Go without me. I can't see at all. You have to get out. Go and get help. Hurry, get going. I got it. Be careful! Hee-yeon, are you okay? Yes! DETECTIVE KIM JIN-YEONG Hello? It's Detective Kim! Detective! Help! Ma'am, are you okay? I need your help. I'm here! Hold on! Please hurry. Hee-yeon! Ma'am! Are you okay, ma'am? Honey! Hee-yeon. Are you okay? Ma'am! Wait for me! I'm coming down! Hee-yeon, wait! Hee-yeon! Honey. Over here. Come here! Come! Mom! Dad! Hee-yeon, let's move! Mom! Jun-hee. Is it that kid? Hee-yeon, don't believe her. You can't trust her! Hee-yeon! Let's go! Please! Hee-yeon! Mom, don't go. Jun-hee. Mom. Let's go, honey. Mom! You said you would protect me. Mom! Hee-yeon, hurrry up! Mom! You promised to stay with me! Mom. It's me, Jun-suh. Mom. Are you here? Let's hurry. Mom, where are you? Mom. I'm right here. Are you coming to get me? Are you leaving me again? Honey, we have to get out. Mom... Mom... Honey. That's not Jun-suh, you know that! Honey! Please! Hee-yeon! Honey! I'm sorry. I'll be right up. Honey! Honey! Hee-yeon! Mom, I missed you. I've been waiting for you. You said you would come back soon. Jun-suh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Mom, I'll be good. Don't throw me out. I didn't throw you out. I would never! I went right back to get you. Jun-suh! My baby, I missed you so much! I missed you. Mom. Mom. Someone help! Sir! Are you okay? Sir! Mom. Mom. Son, are you leaving me? Mom, come here. I miss you.
