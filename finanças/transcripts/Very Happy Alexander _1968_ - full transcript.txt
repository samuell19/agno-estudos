ALEXANDER THE BLESSED Pierrot! Pierrot! Alexander! Alexander! No. - No? - No. Good morning! Morning. Hello, Dad. Hello, Mum. Morning, Alexander. Good morning. Sleep well, Alexander? Yes he did! This morning, dear, you have to rinse the barrels, sort the beet, milk the cow, get out the tractor, take in the harvester, stack the logs, pick the carrots, hoe the strawberries, replant the greens and take the sacks up to the attic. - Then... - Then we'll see. Alexander! That guy's as strong as an ox. Alexander, my dear! - Hi, Alexander! - Hi. She's always on my back! Now's not the time, but... wait till the time comes! Always on my back. - Hi. - Hi, Alexander. Hi, Alexander. Go ahead, shoot, Patureau! Hey, missus! On patrol? Checking up on your lazybones? Don't worry about him. It'd take 4 like you to replace him! No more knocking? I said hush! Quite finished? Alexander, Alexander! Your puppy has arrived. Really? Yes, Louise had a litter. Hello, Alexander. And Mom has had a little sister. Not Mom, us! How are you doing? Say, it's raining babies here. A big 8-pound girl and seven little puppies. Who did it? The butcher's black dog. No, it was Kiki from Crouzet mill! He's not up to it. I like Kiki. It wasn't Kiki, it was the Jouais' pointer. Louise hasn't been slumming it! - Hello, Angéle. - Hello. How's the boss? She's used to it. It's her tenth. If it's the Jouais' pointer, I'll keep you the boldest. And your daughter... same as the others? Too early to tell. I picked out one that shows promise. The little one, here. Give him to me. Give him to me. You know something? What? He looks pretty smart. I reckon he'll be all right. The Jouais' pointer is quite a dog. - I'll buy him a collar. - He's too young. With my name on it. "Alexander Gartempe, farmer." She's quite cute, too. When'll you give the missus one? Oh, the missus... How many posts did you knock in today? 847. Gosh! Follow his example. Homework! Faster. I said homework! - Not too tired? - I'm fine. Look at him. Fresh as a daisy. Help me move my wardrobe. She's calling me! - Alexander! My wardrobe! - Bye! We'll do it tomorrow. Give me a hand, children! No. - No? - No. The Sanguine had a daughter. Again? That's all they're good for. And their Louise had puppies. Fine looking puppies! Hello. Mr Tondeur, this is your 5th week. You're playing Banco this week for 5 million old francs, 50,000 new francs. You have amazed our viewers with your prodigious knowledge of the world of birds. Tonight, the stakes are high. Indeed. And the questions will be much more difficult. - Are you ready? - I'm ready. - What do you say? - Hello. - No, you say...? - Banco! Banco. First series of questions. We will show you three European birds. You have a short time to give their common names and their names in Latin. Clock, Mr Tondeur! That's easy! Eagle owl. Bubo bubo. - Bubo bubo? - Yes. Bubo bubo. Eagle owl, Bubo bubo. You see? Bubo bubo. Second question. A tree pipit. Tree pipit. - Anthus campestris. - No! Not campestris, trivialis. Third question. Answer, Tondeur. Common chiffchaff. Common chiffchaff. Common chiffchaff. Phylloscopus collybita. Phylloscopus collybita. Yes! If it weren't for me... Second series of questions. You will hear the songs of 3 birds. We ask you to name them. Ready? - Banco! - First song. Can I hear it again? Yes, me too... I've no idea. Neither have I. Maybe the grasshopper warbler? No! The grasshopper warbler goes... It could be the Arctic warbler. Impossible. It doesn't whistle! I've got it! The common crossbill. Your answers have been recorded. Who would have won tonight on TV? Eh? And who'll prime the pump? Eh? My common crossbill. Alexander? That vile, blasted, flea-bitten, good-for-nothing mutt! Clear off! He tried to bite me! Just look at that! Come on... Alexander! Your dog was weaned 2 weeks ago! I'm off to the field. The missus... What about her? I can't play nursemaid! I'm on my third pair of slippers. Tomorrow. It's like the wardrobe. It's been 2 months! I can't. It's the missus... I'll come by tomorrow. You great soft thing! You can stand up for yourself. 2CV: 854 GA 28. 75km an hour, pretty girl driving. Here she is. - A 2CV, you said? - Yes. 854 GA 28. Pretty girl driving. That's the one. Little lady... I was doing 40. No. 75. - Who's speaking? - My colleague. Officer, I was doing 40. You shouldn't lie. Nice system you have. We nick everyone with that. Wake up, Alexander. Don't daydream, dear. Think of your work. You hear me, Alexander? Alexander, dear, can you hear? Go ahead. This morning: sort the beans, turn the pumpkins. Then, pick up some fertilizer. Then plough the big field at Maisons Neuves. No, don't stop to gaze at the river. No, don't stop at the billiard hall. No, Alexander. Alexander, can you hear me? Go ahead. - Beans finished? - Yes. Off to the pumpkins. Take the first right. Stop! - Are you in the pumpkins? - Yes. Turn every other one. Call me in an hour. Over and out. Kiss kiss. Over and out. Well done! Off to the co-op. Turn left... I know a shortcut. Do what I say. Take the first left. Are you sure? First left, I said. Right! I was wrong! First right! I did wonder. Can you hear? Go ahead. When you've washed the tractor, primed the pump, taken in the hay, I'll be waiting. Don't be long. Over and out. I won! Two more. - 127. - You've been playing for an hour. I'm not going to lose just to please you. It won't make it. Too short! 128. 150. Tell us when you're done. You messed up. - My turn. - No, wait... Come on, then... 163. Seen the weather? Yes. It's fine. - Exactly. - What do you mean? - The pumpkins. - What? They're early giants from St Petersburg. I hadn't noticed. St Petersburg early giants won't wait. They will today. The billiards can wait. Are you joking? I'm in the band. They'll play without you. Impossible. In The Charming Finch under the Bower I have a solo. I'm the finch. You'll be a finch another day... my dear. You'd make me pick Russian pumpkins today? Dead right. It's the fair! The pumpkin fair. I ask you, who could think such a thing? Damn, damn, damn! The bitch! A promise is a promise. Thank you. Will we see Alexander? He has work to do, poor thing. Alexander, do you hear me? Do you hear me? Go ahead. Hurry, a storm's brewing. Over and out. "A storm's brewing"! Well, she's right about that! It bloody-well will brew! Don't push your luck! Don't push it! You got me this time, but it won't last! Fuck you, slave driver! You hear? Fuck you! It's incredible! The bossy cow! Pumpkins on a holiday! Just you wait! It'll all end in tears! She's always snooping, spying. Alexander this, Alexander that... Do this! Don't do that! She just has to whistle. I haven't even got time to piss, for God's sake! You know what? You married me because I was the strongest. Handy, a strong husband. The day after the wedding, you fired all the hands! Pumpkins on a holiday! I couldn't give a damn about winning awards! Slave driver! Maniac farmer! Alexander has had it up to here. Up to here! Fed up! Fed up to the back teeth! Right up to here! Pumpkins on a holiday, honestly! Don't you see, there's a limit? You push me around, batter me senseless, suck the life out of me? Pumpkins on a holiday! I'll smash your pumpkin head open. Warm day, isn't it? It's hot. Hot as hell. Sanguine, I've come for the wardrobe. Too late. It's been there over a year. Now it's a chicken coop. And a nice one too. It had to be of some use. Besides, it's modern. What about my dog? Your dog? Take a look! He's bigger. And who fed him? How's the missus? And yours? She's been out of sorts. I told her how things are. - And? - Now she knows. Hi. Now's the time to take him. He loves you. Almost a pedigree! I know, but... Why buy him a collar, then? Don't say that. Isn't he the Jouais dog's pup? The strongest of the litter. I can't keep him forever. Now's a bad time. But soon... You've been saying that for a year! You've got no balls! Sanguine, watch your mouth. I'll say it again. - You've... - There are children here. They'd say worse! I won't take it back. Not brave enough for a dog! Like I said, you've got no b... I'll take him. I'll make him a hunter. Make my dog hunt? - Your dog? - My dog. If he's yours, take him! Take your dog! There isn't a slipper left in the house. Have you seen my daughter's doll? I'll cycle to see you on Sundays. You'd do 30km to see a dog? Take him. Fetch the rabbit! Fetch! Up. Sit. Lie down. Good. It's coming. Now the big trick. Stay. stay, OK? Heel! Come back! That's my doggie. It's my dog. What do you say? What? You took the bus? Hush! Be quiet. Back pains. What's that? My dog. I've told you before: no dogs here! Don't ever do that again. Never again! Sorry. I'll glue it back. Fine. You'll feed him yourself. Here, Dog. Not in the bedroom. - He has to sleep somewhere. - But not in here. Lie down. I'll explain later. No! There. Don't cause any trouble, OK? Stay, Dog- Stay. Stay, Dog- Stay. Oh no! Alexander! It's him or me. Lie down. Hush! Oh, really, Dog! What's the meaning of this? Will you come here? No. Right. Alexander, did you check your schedule? Yes? Your work schedule. 1- milk cow 2- bring in corn 3- reap the alfalfa 4- hoe the beet 5- service the tractor 6- don't daydream... And then we'll see. Don't move around, it's tiresome. Always under my feet, always sniffing me, poking me with your snout, on the lookout. Yes? If I move, you sleep. I stop to wait, you sniff the wind. Don't move around, it's tiresome. Do you have to run around too? What's wrong with them all? We have time. You must take your time. Find the time to take your time. You see? Look at them. Just look at them. Running from one place to another. What for? I ask you. They're exhausted like me. They go to bed tired and wake up even more tired. And so it goes. On and on, always the same. There comes a time... I don't know, but... This isn't what it's about. I hear they sentence men to forced labour. I know all about that. And I've done nothing wrong. Don't move, it's tiresome. And you remind me of someone. Say... ever looked at a carrot-flower? Here. Look at that. You see... That's living. I fancy rolling a fag. I'll do it myself. And I'll take my time in doing so. Then take my time smoking it. And take the time to enjoy it. And then... I'll take the time... Alexander! Get a move on! It's hard work! Come on, hurry up. We'll be late. Poor Thomas! We're soon gone! He was 86, though! Yes... No. There! Going like that, mid-season! At least old Thomas can have a rest. Alexander, dear! Don't drop off. Enough is enough... Soon, enough will be enough... TO MY WIFE - Where's the Bouillot grocery? - On the right. Poor Alexander. Poor Alexander! Yes! What will you do now? Me? Nothing. You're alone now. Yes! What'll become of you? Me? Nothing. - You still have your dog. - Yes. - What will you do? - Us? Nothing. That's right. Nothing. That's right. Nothing. Nothing at all. Stay. Come on! Come on. Come on, then. The time has come. What's he up to? It's been 3 days. You don't think he'd... He probably went to the brothel! He's sleeping off a hangover. He's never held his liquor. Well, it has been three days. Hey, there! Aren't you well? I'm sleepy- You've been sleeping 3 days. Precisely. Now's the time to make up for lost time. Bye. Oh no, not you! - You can't stay there. - I can. - In your bed? - Yes. - What about work? - I don't care! And your land? Same as me, it can rest. - Are you mad? - I'm tired. I've been tired for ten years. I'm recuperating. Bye. He's crushed. Three at once! Drunk! - He's never drunk a drop. - Some people... Young Pinsard, when his wife died, he was crushed. - But young Pinsard... - It's the same thing! Because I... Drag him from the bed. Idiots! I'm recuperating! Watch out! I don't know my own strength! But Alexander... The only orders I follow are my own! And I order myself to sleep as much as I like! Get out of here! Go quietly! And shut the bloody door! Today: sleep Tomorrow: sleep Sleep, Sleep, SLEEP We can't let him stay in bed. He's a free man. - I can understand him. - Me too. I'm exhausted. - Go to bed. - When I please! Don't you give me orders. - I'm your elder brother. - Youth power! I've a large family. Exactly! You should stay out of bed. What? Down there! Have you finished? I asked you to go quietly. Do I have to shout for silence? Move about elsewhere! I'm tired. I'm taking a break. I'm on holiday. - He has a gun. - He shoots on sight! Take cover! - My dad saw him. - What's he doing? Nothing. Resting. My dad saw him. He didn't. Nobody's seen him. Did he eat his dog? Roasted, with chestnuts. - That's not true. - No. Go and see. You go. Binault is a chicken! Alexander! She pricked her finger and slept 100 years. 100 years? No way! I read it in a book. - Did Alexander prick his finger? - Yes. He'll sleep 100 years? No, because Prince Charming told him... Wake up! Have you ever seen such a lazy girl! Liven up! Yes. Button your smock. Remember: "She who dozes spills her basket." I don't care, I've no basket. Button your smock. Something's always showing. Did you clean the bedrooms? Scrub the wooden floors? No. But I thought about it. When will you wash the dishes and peel the potatoes? Good morning. Agathe. See to Mrs Boisseau. - What will it be? - It's all written down. You're gonna eat all that? Well! "Well..."! Mind your own business. - Well? - Still the same. Nothing. - Can you believe it? - It's been two months. Can you believe it? Who would have thought? I wouldn't have believed it if you hadn't told me. Two months. $0'? He's been in bed for two months! - What does he do? - Nothing. Sleeps. Who does? - You, stupid. - Here he comes! He comes every day. - It makes you sick, 2 months! - Quiet. He might repeat it. Hello, Dog. Five cans of tuna. Every day, tuna! Always 5 cans of tuna. Ham. How many slices? You should have said. Right. I heard he found money in the wardrobe. - Between the sheets. - You know? Not in front of him! 7.80 for Dog. 7.80. 8 and 2 makes 10. There. See you tomorrow. Goodbye, Dog. Two months! - Incredible. - What does he do? Nothing. He sleeps. - Who? - A lazybones like you! You'd make a fine pair. - The dog does everything? - Everything! Like a maid. He sleeps... I tell you, a standing stone gathers moss. Two months... 2.25 francs. What? 2.10 francs. You should talk to him. What can I say? He has the gun. It's not right. He'll fall ill. A little rest can't hurt him. A little? Two months! - What about his land? - It's resting, he said. I understand him. You road-menders spend your days sunbathing! I've been breaking my back 40 years on country roads. - I understand him. - Go to bed, then! You don't have to tell me twice! Go to bed and spare us your twisted logic! Right. I shall. He won't do it. Lamandin says he's going to bed. "I'm on holiday. Long live Alexander!" Here he is. Hello, Dog. I'll write a note to put in the basket. I've no small left. Will you have large ones? Alexander... No. Dear Alexander... - My dear Alexander. - Yes. "My dear Alexander. "It's been two months." - He knows that. - Quiet! - Right, I'm going to bed. - Don't be silly! So. "it's been 2 months." "The longer it lasts, the harder it is on you... and the others." - Why? - Why? What do I know? Because a man who doesn't work it's odd. It's immoral. So it's moral to slave away like we do? Is that all you can say? I'm off to bed! Just calm down! No, really! With his "moral"... Was it moral for his missus to harass him into slaving like a shire horse? You kept quiet! And let his dignity drain away. Now it's all about "moral"! You're like a clergyman! Careful what you say. - A clergyman. - I'm going to bless you. Right now! If Alexander could see us, he'd laugh. You want a ride? You don't sleep when you own 120 hectares. Hey' Agatha! What did you say? I don't believe you. Aren't you exaggerating a bit? I won't argue with you. You're always right. Fetch some pepper. Pepper Well, can't you find any? He found it. Thank you, Dog. ...This is Sweet Bubble. Easy, now. There! What's this? What is this? Who put pear in basket? You're hiding something from me. There we are. And now, let's go. It's time for a little nap. Would you like that? "The Charming Finch under the Bower, a bucolic fantasy." Yes, you're right. D flat. Seen our homework? Geography, spelling! Fractions, civics and to top it all, gym! I'm staying in bed tomorrow. Down with school! - Our parents don't care. - We'll all do it. Like Alexander! You're right. Tomorrow, we stay in bed. My dad won't wear it. Tell him you've got tonsillitis. Let's hit the sack! - My dad... - We won't get up! Like Alexander! You don't all have tonsillitis? Yes, Daddy. All of you, at once? Yes, Daddy. - Are you putting me on? - Yes, Daddy. No, Daddy. He has tonsillitis. Him too? Pinton! How's your lad doing? Not too well. He's got tonsillitis. Alexander! What's he done? This is your friend speaking. Things aren't going well. It's serious. See what it is. This can't go on. It's spreading like wildfire. Do it for us, Alexander, for Fierbois, for the district, to set an example... - Don't shout, you'll break it. Alexander, stand up and walk! I told you so. It's all over? Yes. Perfect. I'm going in. I'll talk to him. Take care, he has a gun. I fought in Indochina. You were a cook. Yes, but I saw how they fought. I'm going in. Colibert! I'd go myself, but I've a large family. Don't worry. He won't get me. Take cover. Take cover. Lucien, don't act the fool. Mother! Mother! Don't worry about your boy. I'll be all right. Farewell, Mother. Farewell. Guys... If ever... Here, Sanguine. Give my key ring to your kids. And you, Fringale, old friend... my last cigarettes. Think of me. - Are you going or not? - Yes. Come on, my lad. Come on, my lad! Come on. Up the stairs. That's it. Come on. Up, I tell you. Come along, then. Come on. What are you doing here? I've come to talk. Sit down, then. - Well... - Here. Cigarette? - Not his, not yet. - Sorry. - You see? - Yes. Here he comes! Well, Colibert? Well? We talked. He talked to me. I understood. I give up I'm going to bed. We have to get him up. That man is a real menace. No! Can't I sleep 2 months in peace! Hark, Pinton is off the beat. This is no time to flag! Come on, louder! Louder! Come on! Come on! Louder! It's 2.50am and we've played all we know. - Start over again. - One, two...! All night long? Can you believe it! Yes. And my husband's in bed. Serves him right. - I tell you... - Things will work out. Stay out of it. We don't need your input! Ah! Here comes the resistance. Well? Still holding up. That man has an iron will. And the list of casualties is growing. Six of the band are in bed. We'll hold out. But we'll need help. Of course! All for one, one for all. "There's always one more." Stay out of it. We'll set up a blockade. A blockade? Isn't that contagious? Like the British did to Bonaparte. The British are in on it? No bread, no meat, nothing! He'll have to get up to eat. You're blockading him. - Right. - That's a shameful thing to do. "Sleep will vanquish hunger." After a week without food, he'll get up! - I know him. - Look out, he's here. Blockade! Napoleon, shut the door. NO BREAD TODAY Smells like omelet. And fried potatoes. - OK? - Yes. He's making an omelet. - What? - We didn't see it. But we smelt it. - Good God! - He has supplies. You're relieved. Get some rest. Pinton. What's on your mind? Him. Pinton... He makes an omelet. He sleeps, he rests. Now that's living. I want a sleep and an omelet too. Why are we bothering him?. He's a free man. - Stop it... - Three days of being knackered! With the band, we didn't sleep a wink! Soaked to the skin! For 3 days, we've been watching a guy sleeping! But we can't! I've had enough. I'm off to bed! We'll see what happens! Long live Alexander! And omelet with potatoes! Pinton! Pinton, wait! 20 years of 5 hours sleep a night. I'll make up for it. Make up for it in a big way! To bed! Let's hit the duvet! - Hit the hay! - Pinton! - The long night! - Come back! I'll burn his house down. Hey' Anyone there? Yes. A woman? Now they're really trying! - Can I come in? - No! I'm naked. I brought you some food. I don't need anything. Tuna fish. I don't like it. I just wanted to say... that I think you're great. What? You're great. I think you're terrific. I want a photo of you. A photo of me? Are you mad? I'll leave the bag here. Goodnight. See you tomorrow. Sleep well. My name is Agathe and my eyes are almost green. Hear ye! It is brought to the knowledge of citizen Alexander Gartempe, farmer, that in light of events, an extraordinary meeting of the town council will be held tonight at 8 in the Fierbois town hall. In the interests of all, the aforementioned must attend in person... Oh, shit! Alexander, This is old Pitois! They expect you at the town hall tonight. No way around it! It's official. You have to come. So... the kids, the road-mender, Colibert, poor Pinton, the band...! It's an epidemic, Mr Mayor. It's catching. See? Schoolmaster... Sorry. Is it 9 o'clock? No one here. This is mayhem, sir. The man is a scourge! He's here. - Shall I let him in? - Wait. He got up, maybe that's enough. You're the mayor, you must talk to him. All right! Show him in. - Shall I let him in? - Yes! Let him in! Frangois... "Mr Mayol”, "Thank you for your nice invitation "but my current occupation prevents me from travelling." He's taking the piss. "My dog will tell you as much as I could." Sit down, then. Sit, gentlemen. Right, then. What can we do? Get him up. To set an example. - What if he won't? - We force him. Maybe the priest... This is man's business. The police, then. No! He's not a robber. What do you suggest? I don't know. It's beyond me. I want to jack it all in and think of nothing. I want to quit the council... and go to bed. Sanguine, old son. If I did what I wanted, I'd be out fishing. I'd play billiards all day. I'd sleep in the hay. Have you ever looked at a carrot-flower? Sorry. It's after 9... What was he saying? Who knows! We have to get Alexander up? Do YOU agree? He agrees. That ends our programs. Goodnight to all our listeners. What's he playing at at the town hall? Dog? Who is it? It's me. It's me, Agathe. The one with the almost green eyes? Yes. I brought you some pineapples. I hope I didn't wake you. No. No. I was about to go to sleep. Are you still naked? Yes. Well, no. I'm in a nightshirt. And the photo? Were you serious? I brought you mine. You're not bad. Thank you. Wait. Is that you? Oh, sorry! You're not bad either. - Well, see you tomorrow. - No, wait. Yes? Nothing. Dog? Where's Dog? Here, Dog. Come on, lad! Here, Dog. Dog! Dog! Dog! Sanguine, have you seen my dog? You're up and about. Have you lost him? No. He ran away. He'll be back. Dogs don't get lost. I knew it would work. Right. Now he has to stay up. Dog! Here, Dog! Maybe he was sick of being cooped up. Animals need fresh air. - You reckon? - Of course. These animals need to run free. You'd take him to the fields. I took him everywhere. You know, Sanguine, I'm worried. The other night at the meeting, he seemed sad. We've never been as happy, both of us. Don't fret about it. He'll come back. If he does... I'll get up! - You'll get up? - Yes. Alexander! He could follow me everywhere. He'll see the world! You're starting afresh. If he comes back, yes! Every day? Every day! Up with the larks? With the larks. - At dawn? - At dawn. At the crack of dawn? I'll go fishing. Fishing? - And in the afternoon... - Yes? - Billiards. - Billiards? - And at night... - At night? - Bed! - Bed. What a life he'll have. Always out with me. Come here. Here, Dog. Here! I'll take care of you. We'll have a good time. Come on. We'll make time to have a good time. See, Dog? You have to look for them deep down. You leave the bait for a while. But not just any old bait. No. You have to know their taste and what time they like to eat. There. Look. There's a hole, there. Take a look. No, there. By the yellow leaf. That's it. Easy, now. He won't get away. See? Watch. No, give him time. He's tasting. Sucking on it. Weighing it UP--- A little tug will get him excited, you’ll see. Gently. Don't scare him away. It's a big one. Look at him. There! A flick of the wrist... There! Don't be scared. Come and have a look. Got it? And now, I'm going to have a little nap. It's all yours. There. Your turn now. Good heavens! Good heavens! Help me. Don't give him any slack. That's it! Hold on. Hold on, Dog. Don't let him escape. There. Hold on, I'm coming. There... There... That's it. What a blasted, bloody mess of blasted, bloody cabbages! He's here! Here, Dog. Here. Come on, Dog... It's disgraceful! He'll end up a tramp! Dog! Leave the rabbits alone. This calls for a celebration! The first day out. Haven't tasted it since my First Communion. It's like lemonade. But not as good. Alexander, this is a good one. Got some dough? Ten years of scrimping and saving. I can pay now! I'm on holiday for life. Jump in, Colibert. It's warm. Happy now? He's up. I'd rather he went back to bed. Go on! Dog! He's in good shape after 2 months. 120 hectares and he's playing! The harvest's due and he's swimming! Potatoes to pick and he's breaking windows! The man is a lunatic. Hello, Mr Alexander. Is it you, green eyes? Yes. So you're back on your feet? Isn't it too hard? You get used to it. But he was bored, so... Yesterday afternoon, I dreamed about you. You slept yesterday afternoon? Inventory check. I made the most of it. Always seize your chance. You can rely on me for that. I sometimes fall asleep when I'm talking. MY Shoe! Oh, how clever you are! Thank you, Mr Alexander. The water's lovely. It's a big one! Go and make eyes at someone else, you're bothering me! I don't want to tire you. I'm going. I forgot! I brought you a present. Another? You shouldn't have. Oh, but I think you're great. It's from Paris. Tell me if you don't like it. I'm still at Mrs Bouillot's. What do you do in the shop? Me? Nothing. As little as possible. Goodbye, Mr Alexander. How do I look? Malicorne! Scissors. Alexander! I sleep curled up. That can be tiring. That's why I wake up tired. I've tried everything. I recommend on the side, with legs stretched right out. It's the legs that matter. Or on your back if you don't snore. Oh, the back. That's good too. The belly sleepers end up drowning. - No! - Sure! - I'll have to tell Mrs Bouillot. - She sleeps like that? No, but it'll scare her. Is he jealous? Of whom? Mr Alexander... He doesn't wear trousers! - He swims naked? - Almost. Then he basks in the sun. I went skinny-dipping once. - It was good. - Aren't you ashamed? Showing your bottom! At least I can! - Unlike you. - What cheek! A landowner doesn't go naked. Not when you've got 120 hectares. 120 hectares, you're sure? His missus bought 20 before she died. That makes 120. The wheat is high and he's on holiday! - How many hectares? - 45. So that amounts to... Wait. 45 times... - Plus 20%. - Plus 20%, yes. - Well... - Makes how much? More than you'll see in your lifetime, lazybones. Is that field yours? Yes. And the three down there. You're a landowner. And you did everything? - All that? - Agathe, let me rest. But look... you're strong. Strong as four men. Come and rest. Let's fall in love. What? Nothing. Sleep, my turtledove. What? What's the matter? I'm getting married. "The old tom bags the best kittens." - My petticoat... - Yes. Yes, my lovely. Yes, my lovely. How beautiful you are! This is a grand day! - Quick, my shoes. - Yes. Yes, my treasure. What a treasure you're inheriting! 120 hectares to an orphan. Hey, where's my tiara? Everything is ready, my dear. The flowers are plastic. They don't wear out. My ring. Yes, my sweet. Look at this jewel. Alexander is loaded. You mustn't rush him. Careful with my veil! No, my poppet. When two people marry, they become one. - Yes, but which one? - Men are like melons, only half are good. Stop blowing in my ear. Marriage is a lottery. And you hit the jackpot! - Listen, shopkeeper. - Me? - Yes, you, the reactionary. - Mrs Boisseau! Mrs Bouillot. All you can talk about is 120 hectares. All you know is your kilos of salt! 120 hectares is nothing nowadays. With intensive - and extensive - farming, 120 hectares is a postage stamp. I don't have one foot in the grave. But my sweet... I'll build a hen house. Battery hens make good money. And we'll breed fish. And cut flowers are very fashionable. The flower stems will feed the pigs. We'll keep a field for caravans. I'll rent it to Parisians for their holidays. You have to scale up. Hand me my gloves. Yes, ma'am. It's Dog. Alexander! That's enough. Stay. I said stay. Understood? Yes, I know. You'll get us into trouble. Stay, Dog! Alexander, it's him or me. The ties of marriage are sacred. And marriage is the finest of the sacraments. Joy and happiness await you, my children. Agathe... And the Lord shall be thy shepherd. Now we come to the sacred vows. Alexander Gartempe. What? Alexander Gartempe, do you take Agathe Bordeaux to be your wife? Well, then? No. No. No, no. Alexander! I love you! Alexander! Alexander! I love you! We love you too! I love you! Come on, Dog. Alexander! What about your land? And your cabbages? Alexander, I love you! Come on, Dog. Here. Come on. Alexander! Where are you going? I'll see. Will you tell us? Come on... Subtitles - Henry Moon for Eclair Group
