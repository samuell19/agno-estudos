[narrator] Our story begins as most stories do with something worth telling, with something that's new. This story takes place on Holiday Hill Farm where every day is a holiday. Come on along. It's a cool, crisp morning just before Halloween in the most beautiful pumpkin patch you have ever seen. [giggles] [gasps] [squeaks in panic] Phew! -[screams] -You know, I hate fast food. [whimpers] So let's make this as quick and painless as possible... for me. [whimpers] Boris, what did I tell you about playing with your food? Oh, but, sis, I was just... You know, I... She started it. Hmm? Uh-uh. How many times do I have to tell you? It's this kind of behavior that gives bats a bad name, all this scaring and swooping... and bug eating. -It's so old school. -Hm-mm, hm-mm, hm-mm. But, Bella, I'm hungry. Have some granola. Low fat, high protein, and no squirming. But I like squirming. And you just get along there, you little cutie. [giggles] [gasps] [both] Jack! Jack! -[Bella] Come quick! -[Boris] Jack! Oh, Jack. Wait until you see what we've found. -It's amazing. -Huh? Boris, Bella. W-W-What is it? -Well, it's kind of a... Uh, well, a... -You'll see. Follow me. Oh! What? Whoa! Out of the way. Earthquake. Scarecrow... Hi, Jack. Where are we going, huh, Jack? Where we going? To the zoo maybe? Or the circus. Oh, I love the circus. [chants] We're going to the circus! We're going to the circus! Big Tom, how could you even think of leaving little old Bobo behind? And us honeydoos. Don't forget us. Shh! Oh! A square pumpkin. [excited chatter] Impossible. Hello there, little fella. What's your name? [stutters] Spookley. Oh, isn't he the cutest thing? Adorable. Can we eat now? Cute? You're not going to let that orange brick grow here with the rest of us, are you? Are you? Why not? He's a pumpkin. This is a pumpkin patch. Well, look at him. He's not like us. He's a freak of nature. A mistake. A weed. [horrified gasps] I'm not a weed. And you know what weeds do. They spread, and they don't stop spreading until they take over. Oh, this is all we need. -And with Halloween-- -Oh, shucks. Cut it out, Little Tom. He's just one little pumpkin. That's all it takes, just one bad pumpkin to ruin the whole patch, and he is it. No, I'm not. I say, the only good pumpkins are round pumpkins. But it's not my fault I'm square. Maybe I'm not done growing yet. [inhales] [creaking] [exhales] And that name, Spookley. What kind of name is that? It sounds evil. Spookley. Spookley. Spookley the square pumpkin. ♪ Look at Spookley, look at him ♪ ♪ He's so odd, he won't fit in ♪ ♪ Look at Spookley, who'd pick him? ♪ ♪ Spookley the square pumpkin ♪ ♪ All the pumpkins in this patch are nice and round ♪ ♪ We all match ♪ ♪ But not Spookley, look at him ♪ ♪ Spookley the square pumpkin ♪ ♪ In every patch in every town ♪ ♪ The pumpkins they pick are nice and round ♪ That's true. ♪ It happens every year ♪ ♪ The best'll get picked ♪ ♪ I guess you'll rot here ♪ ♪ Look at Spookley, look at him ♪ ♪ He's so odd, he won't fit in ♪ ♪ Look at Spookley, who'd pick him? ♪ ♪ Spookley the square pumpkin ♪ ♪ I can't help the way I am ♪ ♪ I wish I could be more like them ♪ ♪ It's hard to fit in when you've found ♪ ♪ You're a square and the world is round ♪ Loser! ♪ Look, look, look, look ♪ ♪ He's so rectangular ♪ ♪ Look, look, look, look ♪ ♪ He's so triangular ♪ ♪ Look at Spookley, who'd pick him? ♪ ♪ Spookley the square... ♪ ♪ Spookley the square... ♪ -♪ Look at Spookley, look at him ♪ -♪ He's so rectangular ♪ -♪ He's so odd, he won't fit in ♪ -♪ He's so triangular ♪ ♪ Look at Spookley, who'd pick him? ♪ -♪ Spookley ♪ -♪ Spookley ♪ -♪ Spookley ♪ -♪ Spookley ♪ -♪ Spookley ♪ -♪ Spookley ♪ ♪ Spookley the square pumpkin ♪ [sniffs] [both laugh] [both gasp] Hey, what's the big idea? Hey, hey, hey, put us down. If I put you down, will you guys behave? -Yeah. No problem. -No problem. [both] You bet. You won't even know we're here. Invisible as a dormouse. [both grunt] Except for, well, staying in the patch is one thing, but there's no way, no how, and not the slightest possibility that pointy over there is going to be allowed in the Jack A Lympics. Oh, gosh, the Jack A Lympics. Well, I... [Little Tom] Of course not. A square pumpkin, in the Jack A Lympics no less. -Never been done, never been heard of. -Well, no. I guess it's never been heard of. But, Jack, Spookley is a pumpkin. You said so yourself. [both grunt] -Wha...? -[yells] [groans] What did you say? She said, "Spookley is a pumpkin." I heard what she said! Well, you're right about that. And we did find it right smack dab in the middle of the patch. The pumpkin patch. That's a fact, and that does make him part of the patch. But, Jack... And the winner of the Jack A Lympics is how we name the pick of the patch for Halloween. Isn't it, Jack? Well, sure it is! And it's the greatest honor of all for a pumpkin on a holiday made especially for pumpkins. Halloween. Has been ever since I've been in charge around here. Well, at least, I think it has. As if we didn't all already know who's the pick of this pumpkin patch. [giggles] Pumpkin. Uh. Of course, all the events are kind of geared toward roundness, I guess. Traditionally, that is. Yes, yes, exactly. Tradition. And where would we be without tradition? -But...? -Tradition. [yelps] But he is a pumpkin, and... [clears throat] Not really, Jack. With all due respect, the pumpkin or pumpkinus pumpkinumpkinus, is by definition round. And when you say pumpkin, you are talking about a long tradition of roundness. Real pumpkins are round. The end. I need to do some thinking on this. This is a real head-scratcher. [whistles] [chuckles] [narrator] Poor Spookley sat there all alone, sad and confused, wishing he hadn't grown, wondering how different things might have been if he was round, if he fit in. [sighs] [sniffs] ♪ If I was round, then you'd see ♪ ♪ They wouldn't make fun of me ♪ ♪ And maybe I would find a friend ♪ ♪ If I was round, if I was more like them ♪ ♪ If I was round, I would be ♪ ♪ More like them and less like me ♪ ♪ And maybe I would fit right in ♪ ♪ If I was round, if I was more like them ♪ ♪ There'd be no more teasing, no more taunting ♪ ♪ No more staring, no more pointing ♪ ♪ No more wishing that I wasn't found ♪ [sighs] ♪ If I, if I, if I ♪ ♪ If I was... ♪ ♪ If I was round ♪ I've decided there's only one thing to do. Well? Square or not, Spookley's a pumpkin. And every pumpkin deserves a chance to win the Jack A Lympics and be the pick of the patch on Halloween, and every pumpkin, no matter what, deserves a chance to wear the candy corn crown. What? Wear the crown? But... The crown! The crown! The candy corn crown. - The crown! - The crown! The crown! The crown! The candy corn crown. Now, where did I put it? Uh... No. [laughs] Oh, I knew this was gonna happen! [thud] Oh! There it is. -The candy corn crown. -[pumpkins gasp] Did somebody say candy? Did somebody say crown? Why, Jack, that looks like the very one I lost last week. Huh? Sorry, Bobo, but you'll have to win this if you want it. Hm! OK, we kick off the Jack A Lympics tomorrow, and everybody, including Spookley... Spookley? Oh, Spookley? Where'd he go? Aw, what's so great about Halloween anyway? [spider 1] What's so great about Halloween? I can answer that in one word. Candy corn. -[spider 2] Ah, that's two words, boss. -[Spookley] Who's there? -Edgar. -Allan. And I'm Poe with an "e" on the end. Y-You're spiders. -We prefer to say we're in web design. -[drum and cymbal crash] And did we really hear you ask what was so great about Halloween? Why, it's a pumpkin's dream holiday. [chuckles] -It is? -Absolutely. There ain't nothing more popular than a pumpkin on Halloween, especially here on Holiday Hill Farm. Oh, I don't know. Still not convinced, huh? - Well, let me show you what I mean. - [bell chimes] ♪ La, la-la, la, la ♪ ♪ La, la-la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪ ♪ La, la, la ♪ ♪ La, la, la ♪ ♪ Spookley, Spookley, watch your webs and you'll see ♪ ♪ Halloween is fun for pumpkins ♪ -♪ Trick or treating ♪ -♪ And sweets for eating ♪ ♪ Jack-o'-lanterns and a ghostly greeting ♪ -♪ Boo, boo ♪ -Come on, let me hear it. -♪ Boo, boo, boo ♪ -That's it, that's the spirit. -♪ Boo, boo, boo ♪ -Halloween's your night, kid. -Join the crowd and shout out loud. -♪ Boo, boo, boo, boo ♪ -Boo. -[yelps] ♪ Halloween is fun, fun for everyone ♪ Especially pumpkins. ♪ Listen, listen, you don't know what you're missing ♪ -Pumpkins are important. -You're a Halloween tradition. -♪ Boo, boo ♪ -Who? -You. -Really?

Did Itsy-Bitsy stop climbing the water spout because the other spider said he couldn't? No. -Did Charlotte stop spinning her web? -No. -And do you know why? -No. Because they believed in themselves. That's why. You know, Spookley, I think there's an itsy-bitsy spider inside of you. You do? Sure I do. Listen, you want to be the pick of the patch for Halloween, don't you? Well, I guess. Sure. Great, Spookley, my boxy friend, and we're gonna help you win that delicious, scrumptious, mouth-watering, sugar-coated crown. [laughs] Aren't we, boys? [both] Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh. -[drumroll] -[fanfare] [narrator] The day had finally arrived for the pumpkins' big test. Each one was ready to do his or her best. Because the pumpkin that did everything just right, would be the pick of the patch on Halloween night. Ah, the Jack A Lympics. I love 'em. Me, too. I've been pumpkin up all year. What are you doing here? I'm going to be in the Jack A Lympics too. Says who? Says us. [laughs] Oh, yeah. [laughs] Oh, you're kidding. Oh, you make me... Oh, I'm dying here. -What are you laughing at, tiny? -[laughs] Oh, right. -Tiny? Why, you... I... -[spiders scream] Whoa. Get him, Big Tom. All right, everybody. We... Well, hello there, Spookley. Glad you could make it. Well, let's get the Jack A Lympics started! [fanfare] [cheering] OK. Here's what's gonna happen. Bella, Boris, a little help, please? Well, first off, we've got the Pumpkin 500 racing around and around this track here. Secondly, it's the Smack O Lantern, knock down the pins here, here, here, and here. And finally, it's the Pumpkin Pitch, flying through the air. Accuracy counts. Any questions? [clears throat] I would just like to say on behalf of all the pumpkins, that clearly the winner of these events will be I. So if you would just hand over the candy corn crown, Jack, everyone could get back to their little lives. Is everybody ready? Is everybody... Do I not look ready? OK, everybody meet up by the water tower in five minutes. -Let's get going. -Huh? Aw... What's the matter, Spookley? [sighs] I don't know if I can do this. Sure you can. Come on. Besides, you'll never know if you never try. Hey, wait for us. Ah! Doesn't that Bella seem awfully nice? Let me tell you something about bats, my young friend. They are the lowest form of bug-eating life, bar none. They are sneaky and slimy. -And smelly. -And smelly. Thank you, Allan. Why, I get mad just thinking about it. [they yell] Hello, Appetizer. -Meet Entrée and Dessert. -Wait a minute. You can't eat us. -Why not? -Because bats eat bugs, and in case you didn't know, we're not bugs. -We're arachnerds. -Uh, "nids." We are arachnids. Yeah, I mean "nids." Ah, well, arachnerds, arachnids, a rack of lamb, it's all the same to me. I love bugs. [laughs] Step right up.

No more bugs. I promise. [yells] Ouch! Fricassee, shmicassee! Hm. That was some of the worst singing I've ever heard. Oh, that Bella sure is sweet, and nice, too. Would it be so wrong for a spider to fall in love with a bat? Uh... Eh... Ah... Oh... Uh... Let the Jack A Lympics begin. [fanfare] The first event is the... the Pumpkin 500. Good luck, everybody. First pumpkin across the finish line is the winner. Give me a B. Give me an O. Give me B-O. Ew... Go, Bobo. [laughs] All right, kid, you are a power runner. You've gotta be fast out of the blocks. Yeah, yeah, and remember, victory is sweet. [slurps] Like candy corn. Like Bella, too. On your mark. Get set. -Go. -[panting] [Edgar] Come on, Spookley. You can do it, baby. Go, go, go! Yeah! Yeah! [panting] [spiders grunt] Huh? Whoa. [pumpkins yelp] Hey! Whoa! [mumbles] Uh, uh, what'd he say? He said... Run! [yells] Whoa! [grunts] [yells] The winner! -[fanfare] -Winner, winner, winner. [groans] [pants] Is it... Is it over? Di... Did I... Did I win? Not exactly. But don't worry, kid. It's not how you start, it's how you finish. It ain't over till it's over. And it ain't over. Is it over? -[cheering] -[fanfare] Little Tom and Big Tom, you are disqualified for cheating. First place goes to... -[drumroll] -Bobo. -[fanfare] -Just give me it already. -[Little Tom grunts] -[thud] [Poe] Oh, Bella? Yoo-hoo. Whoa! The second event is the Smack O Lantern. To win, all you have to do is roll down the ramp and knock down the most pins. Hey, hey, hey. Oh, sorry. I mean eggplants. -Oh. -[eggplants chuckle] Oh! [laughs] Ready? Steady? Go! [eggplants yell] [laughs] One... Nine! Good one, Bobo. Hmm. [chattering] Big Tom, Big Tom, he's our man. If he can't do it, Little Tom can. Go! [groans] [eggplants scream] -[pumpkins] Whoo-hoo! -OK! A perfect ten! Yay. Hip, hip, hooray! Get out there and mow 'em down. -Think round thoughts. -Be the ball. Come on, Spookley. It's your turn. Oh, oh... [Jack] Go. [Spookley] Oh! [grunts] [eggplants laugh] Keep your chin up, kid. You're doing great. He doesn't stand a chance. [fanfare] Yee-haw! [Jack] Bobo wins again. Big Tom, Little Tom-- Don't tell me... Disqualified. Sheesh. -Whoa! -Hey! [blows kiss] Boris? [strains] Spookley isn't doing so well, is he? [both] Aw. [strains] -Poor Spookley. -[sniffs] This is breaking my heart. [blows nose] The final event in our Jack A Lympics, the Pumpkin Pitch, is gonna send you sky high. [laughs] All you have to do is fly through the air and land in that hole over there. OK, Bobo, ladies first. [chant] Five, four, three, two, one. Look out below, here we come. Yeah! Wheeeeee! Piece of cake. [both yell] [Big Tom grunts] [both yell] [both grunt] [Big Tom] Probably we're disqualified again, huh? [Little Tom] Oh, be quiet. All right, Spookley. Looks like you're next. I don't think I can fly. That's yam talk. It's all in the mind. Hey! What's going on? Whoo! Abandon pumpkin! Abandon pumpkin! -[Edgar yells] -[Spookley] Whoa! [Spookley] Whoa, whoa, whoa! [Spookley screams] [grunts] [grunts] I think I fell on my stem. What's a spider got to do to get some candy around here? Well done, everybody. Well done. Now it's time to crown the winner. The pumpkin who'll be the pick of the patch this Halloween. [cheering] Oh. Now it sure isn't going to be easy. Everybody did a fine job, but just let me figure out what the scores were. Oh, let's see, three events times ten. No, whoa. One event worth... All right, 200 minus 500, that's... OK, minus ten points for disqualifying, and that means the winner is... Bobo with three points. [fanfare] [cheering] -Hmm! -[groans] Well, so long, kid. You were great. Really. Bobo, baby, you need an agent, and have I got a spider for you. And have you got some candy for us. Do you think Bella likes me? I mean, likes me likes me? [Edgar] Poe, come on! I would just like to thank all the little people who helped me get to where I am today. I would also like to say that more than anything, I wish for world peas. [peas] Yay! [cheering] Oh. All right, everybody. Now we've found the pick of the patch, let's get this party started. Hit it, girls. ♪ The Transylvania twist ♪ ♪ The Transylvania twist ♪ ♪ The Transylvania twist ♪ ♪ Do the Transylvania... ♪ -[thunder rumbles] -[Jack] Huh? -[wind whistles] -[thunder crashes] Uh-oh. I don't like lightning. Nothing to worry about. It's just a little... [wind whistles louder] [laughs nervously] ...breeze. [Boris] Oh... Maybe a little rain, too. [narrator] Halloween was just a day away when a mighty storm blew across the bay. It tossed the round pumpkins to and fro. They'd lose control, then off they'd go. Bouncing left, slamming right, banging, bashing, what a sight! Spookley realized sitting there it's fine to be round while the weather is fair, but there are times it's better to be a square. [straining] Tom, Tom. Help, my crown. Uh, don't worry, I'll get it. [grunts] [grunts] -[thunder crashes] -[spiders yell] [Bobo wails] -[Jack yells] -[Bobo screams] [Bobo wails] -[Big Tom] Hey! -[Little Tom] Whoa! [Bobo] Help! Phew. -[cracking] -Oh! -[strains] -We're too heavy! -[crack] -[Big Tom groans] [laughs] Don't you dare, you little... Oops. [screams] Hmm! Help! Jack! Oh, don't move. I'll be right there.

Stop screaming and help us! [Boris] You're right. This is a moment for cool, clear thinking. Whoa. [yells] I've got to help Jack. [narrator] Spookley watched as the flames of the fire grew near, looked up at the water tower and got an idea. That's it. [ding] Hey, what's Spookley doing? [Spookley pants] [gasps] [groans] Boris, look! [gasps] We're gonna die! [whimpers] [splutters] Huh? [laughs] Whoa! [screams] [Bobo] Help! [pumpkins scream] [all] Phew. [pumpkins scream] Get us out of here! I'm still stuck! [narrator] Spookley knew what must be done. It was up to him. He was the one. [yells] Uh-oh, this could turn out badly. Whoa! Who-o-oa! -Here comes Spookley. -[pumpkins scream] [Spookley yells] Ah, there goes Spookley. [pumpkins scream] [Bobo] Help! [cheering] [all] Spookley! Hi, everybody. [cheering] -All right! -Spookley!

Thanks, Jack. Oh, Little Tom, don't you have something to say to Spookley? Well, I guess being round ain't everything after all. -It's not? -I'll say it's not. Square is definitely in this year. [inhales] [all laugh] Bella? Boris, would it be so wrong for a bat to fall in love with a spider? [buzzing] -Boris? -[mumbles] -Boris? -[spits] No more bugs. I promise. Enough chit-chat.
