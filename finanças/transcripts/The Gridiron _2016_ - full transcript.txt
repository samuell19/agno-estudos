Five, six, seven, eight, Let's go Railroaders, let's go Railroaders, let's go Railroaders! Five, six, seven, eight, C.R.E.W.E. Railroaders! Railroaders! Rail.. roaders! Woo! What to you think, Coach? Magic, that Angie, yeah. You've come on leaps and bounds. Do you mean that? Absolutely, yeah and there's more of you. Yeah, I auditioned more. - Fantastic. - Thanks, Derek Well done, keep it up. Get another helmet and set of pads with that. Where's this come from? I got a bonus at work this week. It's okay, Kym knows. - We better keep an eye on him. - Huh? Alright guys, show is over. Stop looking at them skirts. Let's get back to work. If he starts getting shifty, give Eddie a shout or something. Okay, guys, listen up. Today is the last day to fight for the position you want. We are going to play Offense verses Defense in game situation and go out there like a bunch of crazed dogs. Here are the starting line ups. Take a look and get into positions. Cadillac, come on. Sorry Coach. Hey guys, check this out. - What are you doing? - Where'd you get that from? It's not real, you pillocks, it's just a pellet gun. - Cover me though, yeah? - Yeah, okay. Ready? Break! Down... Set... Ow! Oh, you don't want a penalty, boys. Hey, hey, hey, what is wrong with you guys today? What's up, Coach? What do you mean, what's up? Do I look like Stevie Wonder? I can see the gun. It's just a joke, Coach. Christ. It wasn't funny. I ought to shoot you in the ass. Get back in the huddle. We still get the five yards? In the huddle. ♪ Quiet. I can't believe your attitudes out here today. Do you think this is some sort of joke? Do you think I'm here to watch you guys jerk around? If this is just a big joke to you guys, I'm gone. - No, coach, coach! - Nah, I'm done. Look guys, this attitude is really starting to piss me off. You've got to start taking this seriously. I thought we had something here. I thought we all wanted to play American Football on a National scale. From this point on, this becomes serious or not at all. Right, everybody in. Sean, come on. Cheerleaders. One, two, three! Railroaders! ♪ Was that the post? Yeah, yeah, just a letter from the UKAFA fixtures of who we are playing this season. Nothing important then. Right, better go. See you later then. Right, lads. Thanks for coming at such short notice, but let me tell you it's good news. I have here the official schedule. Our season begins away at Hereford. But you want to know something really interesting? I got a phone call from the Leamington Royals, they want to play a pre-season game here in Crewe. We've got four weeks before our first game. Yes, this is it, Sean, this is it. Derek. These cats ain't ready, man. They might think they are ready, but they are not even close. Four weeks ain't enough. What do you know? You're not even a real coach. What the hell is wrong with you man? I don't have to be a real coach to understand that these cats ain't ready. What's gotten into you, man? I'll tell you what's gotten into me. In four weeks time, good or bad, win or lose, do or die, we play our first game and that's final. Oh, watch out. Oh, sorry. Have I missed something? Yeah, your boy's tripping. Little bit of an atmosphere. Okay, Mister Stanyer is ready to see you now. You're not making any sense whatsoever. The Cumberland Sports ground would be ideal. As I mentioned before the only place available that matches your criteria are the Middlewich playing fields. But we are the Crewe Railroaders, not the Middlewich Railroaders. I'm sorry, but that's all I can offer you at such short notice. But look, the Cumberland Sports ground is free that weekend. Why can't you just let use it? We are expecting a big crowd. The Cumberland Athletic Track is the pride and joy of the county. You can't seriously be suggesting that we turn over our flagship facility for you to churn up. So you would rather let it stand empty than let us use it. Is that what you are saying? The offer of Middlewich still stands. I am trying my best to accommodate you. No. You are treating this sport like everybody else. Like we are some kind of freak show. Well, it's not the last you have heard of this. I'm writing to my M.P. She'll appreciate what we're doing for Crewe. We are going to be representing this town up and down the country and you are not even helping us. I've done all I can. Well we'll see about that. That's it, guys. Come on, take a knee. Deep breaths. How we feeling? - Good. - Good. So this is it, guys. The next time you put on your helmets, you will be playing your first game. Listen up, everybody. I picked up the jerseys. We've got some kit. Yeah! Right, lads, bring it in. One, two, three... Railroaders! Any news on the ground? No, I'm going to have to go into the council and suck up one last time. - Look man, just cancel the game. - I can't. Come on, dawg. We don't have a place to play, the team ain't ready and I'm telling you somebody is gonna get hurt, man. No, this game goes ahead. I need this game to go ahead. This is not about you anymore, man. This is about the team, what's best for the team. No, it is about me. This was my idea, this is my team. I stand to lose everything because of it and I mean everything. So I say we play Sunday. Oh, for God's sake. What now? This has got to stop. I'm not in the mood for this. You wanna fight? Let's fight. Come on, I'm fucking ready. I'm fucking ready. I want to play. You want to play? Yeah. Sean! We need a new jersey. Alright, alright. Kym, what's all this? What's going on? I've had enough of your lies. What do you mean? This fell out of your jacket when I was putting it away. When were you going to tell me? Unless we come up with the money by next Monday then we would lose the house. Is that still the situation? I'm not stupid, Derek. I know where that money's gone. On that fucking football team. No, please, Kym. We've got our first game next Sunday, the gate receipts will pay off all our debts. It will all have been worth it. We're not lose the house. Yeah? Look at me, look at me. We're not gonna lose the house. Just please don't leave me. Oh, I wasn't leaving, that's full of your clothes. This house obviously means nothing to you. Sort this mess out or I'm throwing you out. I mean it, Derek. Two hundred quid? You want me to loan you another two hundred quid? Well you got some balls, I'll give you that. Ain't he? Got some balls like? Yes, balls! Please, Sharky, I'm in big trouble. You are in big trouble, my lad. With me. You owe me... Ooh, let's see... two hundred and fifty quid. Bit too fruity that, let him go. Look, I'll be able to give you some of it back on Sunday out of the gate receipts. Really? Well how does this sound? We'll see you Sunday to collect two hundred and fifty quid. And no, you can't have another two hundred you cheeky sod. I can't make Sunday. It's my mother's birthday. Your mothers birthday? Do you know what, I can't run a business like this. You're sacked. I'll bloody well go myself. Sunday. Two hundred and fifty quid or else. Daisy! Ey up, toss pot. I, uh... I hate to ask, but don't suppose you can lend me two hundred quid? Very funny. What do you want? I'm serious, Gerry, I need two hundred quid. Oh, mate, I haven't got it. Alright. I'd just thought I'd ask. I mean, yeah, of course I've got it, I'm just not giving it to you. ♪ That's the situation, including this weeks wages I need one hundred and sixty quid or else they will kick us out of the house. Why am I not surprised? Answer me this. Did you spend your money on the football team? I told you, I bloody well told you. Alright look. I get the picture, I'm useless, pathetic, I've heard it all before. All I want to know is will you lend me one hundred and sixty quid? What? He'll only go and do it all again won't he? Oh, forget it. I knew it was a waste of time coming here, don't know why I bothered. Hey! That's right, it's all our fault, isn't it? There's always somebody else to blame but yourself. Derek wait. Mum, thank you. I'll give it you back on Monday after we have play the game, yeah? You just make sure you use it to pay off the arrears and don't tell your Dad. Oh, hello. Could I speak to the head of sports and recreation please? Hello. Yeah, speaking. Mhm. Oh, yeah. Really? Right, okay. Yeah, that's amazing. Thank you. Half and hour? Yeah, I can be there in half an hour. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you very much. Alright, see you. Yes! Yes! What's up with you? We've got the Cumberland Sports ground to play our games at. Oh, love, things are looking up for us. Oh, did you call in sick for me? Yes. Great. I'll pay this in then. Well it seems the plight of your team had quite an impact on a certain Member of Parliament. Therefore after much deliberation, we, the council, have decided that the Cumberland Athletic track will be made available to you this Sunday. Of course there will be a nominal hire charge, but we have reduced the fee to one hundred and forty pounds. A hundred and forty pounds? Yes. Yes, it would normally be two hundred pounds. Oh, and we need that now so we can get everything moving. Shit. I'll just get you a receipt then. Are you okay? There we are. No, no, sorry can't do it, can't do it. I need the money. Look can we please pay you out of the gate receipts? I'm sorry, you can't charge the public for admission into the game. Our public liability insurance doesn't cover American Football. We can't charge admission? No. We need to charge admission. You don't understand. Well, I'm sorry. You can't. I'll give you seven days. Seven days to pay after the game. That's the best I can do. Thank you. ♪ So the money you've been giving me for pads and helmets should have been paying off your bills off? I thought we'd get it all back from the gate receipts. I've been an idiot, mate. So we definitely can't charge admission? Nope. And now I owe my mum hundred and sixty quid, Sharky two hundred and fifty. I've not made any payments on the bloody phone for months and they are about to cut the electricity off. God what a mess. Does Kym know all this? But you paid your rent arrears off. Yeah. At least that's safe for the time being. I'll tell Kym after the game on Sunday about everything else. ♪ Why was no one taking money at the gate? Don't worry, love, I'm sure it's all been taken care of. He's forgotten to organize, ain't he? Wouldn't surprise me. You know what he's like. Hey, hey, hey, calm down, calm down, calm down. Listen up. Hey, hey! Listen up. I was just talking to the refs and we got major problems. Oooh! Come on, Jenny, out. Alright, chill, chill, chill. Everybody chill out. Check it out. Everybody must have a mouth piece. You will not be allowed to play unless you have one. If you don't have one, raise your hand. You guys are going to have to share with each other man. Hey, hey, hey! Don't quit on me now. It's that or you don't play, what do you want to do? Play. Well then find some dog to share your mouth piece with. Hey Danny, Danny! Want to share with me like? Five, six, seven, eight... Wait, you! Derek, why is no one collecting money? Sorry, love, I'll tell you later. James, I need to apologize. You're a great coach and we couldn't have done it without you. No worries. It's been a blast, man. Just hope nobody gets hurt. I still don't think these dudes are ready. You're probably right.

I know you don't think so, but I love you and I'm so sorry, but... Ah, there you go. These will ease the pain a bit. Oh dear, the sooner we get you get home the better. That's it. He's ready to go now. I really need to tell you... Not now, love. There's something you need to see first. Come on. Sean told me what an asshole you've been. Funding the team, neglecting your family. That's not cool, man. Not cool at all. So we took up a collection after the game. These dawgs really appreciate you putting everything on the line for them. There's enough there to cover most of your debt and pay for the ground fees. Don't do it again. You hear me? - Wow! - I'll look after that. Wow! I don't know what to say. Well, I know we lost.
