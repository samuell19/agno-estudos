Christian community has become a soft target for radical groups in the last one month. This incident has left many in the Christian minority community shattered and broken. We just hope that the... One hundred and twenty seven church buildings have been torn down or burned. Tens of thousands of Christians have hidden in the surrounding forests for months. We don't understand that if India is called a secular state, why do such incidents happen? To defend itself. Christians alleged that right wing organization... - Guess who. - An ugly old hag. - Manav. - Ow! Shh. - Look. - Oh. "Thank you for your submission of your work." There were a lot of things I didn't know when Shanti, who was heavily pregnant, and I came to Orissa. Back then, the thing I was most afraid of was the curse of leprosy. But at that moment, it seemed like the obvious choice. I needed a remote location, I had a job offer of sorts, and I understood the language. The conversion issue was hot. All perfect for a journalist who had a point to make. - Banerjee? - Dilip? - Prishima told me about you. - We've been waiting for you. - That's my wife. - Namaskar. Namaskar. - Namaskar. - Uh, look, here the keys. Ah, thank you. And here's the rent. - Five hundred. Here. - Ah, thank you. - Thank you. - Uh... - Banerjee? - Yeah. Deposit? - Uh... - It's just one month rent. We didn't know of the deposit. But I guess, uh... - Um, h... here's the 500. - Mm-hmm. I've arranged the rickshaw. He knows the place. - Okay. Good. - Thank you. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. All we can afford. It's fine. I know. Are you gonna see the editor tomorrow? Yeah, I need the work. You'll get it. You're a great writer. And then... promotions. Editor. Best-selling author. Manav Banerjee? - I like your work, Banerjee. - Thank you, sir. But to give you full-time, I need new material. Raj. - Hm. - I... I can produce, sir. It's just that my wife is pregnant, so... - Oh. First child? - Yes, sir. - How long you've been married? - Not long, sir. Aha. Pregnant already. Yeah. I'll see what I can do. So, right then. Sir, what kind of article are you looking for? News. Sir, yesterday at Baripada Market, a young beggar boy was found to have leprosy. People were shouting, pushing each other, wondering what to do with the boy. And then from the crowd walked a man. Okay. Come on, it's okay. Manav... who is he? Staines. Not news. - Oh. Someone told you? - No. He's a missionary, Banerjee. You said it yourself. First, conversions, then imperialism. You want to support that? Mm. Hello. No, I'm busy now. Sir. Do you know how much it costs to convert someone to Christianity? Five hundred among the poor. Ten dollars. Less, I think, if the convert happens to be a leper. So? Sir, a missionary flies back to the West and tells them that he's converted 1000 people, for which, of course, he gets paid, but which is much more than $10 per person. Good business. Yes. But the law here in Orissa states that no person shall convert or attempt to convert any person from one religious faith to another. Yes, by use of force or by inducement or by any fraudulent means. Sir, and yet not one missionary has been charged. Not yet. That would make good news, sir. You bring me evidence of illegal conversion by Graham Staines. I'll give you a permanent position. Loan me a camera, sir, and I'll get you photo evidence. I'll loan you a camera, but... I need a deposit. How much money do you have? Hello. I told you I am busy. No, I don't know anybody! Why do you have security in this office? He's mad! Send him out! Mad fool. Dead is dead. This will do. There's a conversion of a tribal girl in Baripada tomorrow. This is your opportunity. You won't be disappointed, sir. Ticket. Where you go? Uh, I'm from New Orissa. I'm a journalist. I... listen, can I pay you tomorrow? No. Listen, my wife is pregnant. I need to get home. - Congratulations. - Please. Do you want me to write about your bus? Halfway to BP Town, this bus will be packed like cattle going to slaughter, way beyond the seat limits. Do you want to lose your license? I'm not getting out. Thank you. Baripada. - Going to Baripada? - Yes. - Your bottle? - Yes. Have it. All Indians are brothers and sisters. Yes, all Indians are my bothers and sisters. India is my country, and all Indians are my brothers and sisters. I love my country, and I'm proud of its rich and varied heritage. I shall always strive to be worthy of it. I shall give my parents, teachers and all elders respect and greet everyone with courtesy. To my country and my people, I pledge my devotion. - I am not. - He's a leper! - I am cured. - Leper! He's a leper! - I am cured. - Stop the bus! Stop! - I am cured. - Stop! I am cured! Hey! Hey, stop, hey! Hey, stop the bus! Stop the bus! I'll report you! Please. Please. Please. Please. - Huh. - Namaskar. Namaskar. Are you heading towards Baripada Town? - Yup. - I need to get home. Well, jump in. I won't bite. Sundar. You haven't mentioned your visit. No good, sahibo. How many times do I go? - Seven times seventy. - Leper! He's a leper! - Mate, mate, mate. - Stop the car! - Just stop the car! - He's alright. Calm down! - Stop the car! Stop! - Alright, alright. Calm down. Stop this car now. I... is this a setup? He pays for my ticket. The bus leaves, you turn up, huh? - Just offering you a lift. - Not with a leper! Calm down, mate. He's been healed 30 years. Whatever! I can't travel with him! I... He's not contagious. He's been healed. I can't! I... I got the job. Wow, that's great. I have a story to cover. Do you want to be my bodyguard? Mm. - I've been... - What? Nothing. I just couldn't sleep. I'll sleep now. Are you willing to be baptized of your own free will? Yes. I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through me. I baptize you in the name of the Father the Son, and the Holy Ghost. May the peace of God, which passeth all understanding... Hey! - What do you have there? - Good morning. May I help you? - Is it money? Huh? - No, it's not. Th... this is an illegal conversion, huh? - No. Her mother is a Christian. - Well, her father is a Hindu. He let her choose. - I want to talk to her. - You can talk to me, sir. Where's your affidavit for a conversion? If the police wants it, I'll do it. You don't need it. You... you think Th... this thing, this... this cross... - Let it go. - Gives you the right? Don't touch. Let it go. You can do any illegal conversion? - You can do what you like, huh? - Who are you to ask? - This is not done! - Let it go! I know people like you! I want the papers! Hey. Hey, mister! Wait! It's not over yet! She's beautiful. Just like you. - Why didn't you tell me? - A month early. Thought it was nothing. You better pay them. - Sir. Sir, one thing. - Yeah, your fee, right? - No, no. Your wife. - Yeah? She's bleeding. Bleeding very much. Take her to hospital. I've made her comfortable. The uterus should contract now. But she has lost a lot of blood. Too much. And if she continues to bleed... You understand? You want pay? Sir, I need the money, sir, so I... I'm sorry, Banerjee. We have rules. Sir, I was attacked, sir. They didn't want to be photographed, sir. Still, your responsibility. Sir, my wife is in hospital. I've borrowed money to pay for medication and blood, sir. I'm sorry, that's your family matter. Sir. Mm. - At least this is good. - Thank you, sir. Good afternoon, sir. Yes, I think I have. He's good. Evidence of fraudulent conversions by Staines are not easily come by. Sir, inducements come in many forms, so... For success in an endeavor like this, someone needs to become a Christian in order to gain their trust. Thereby gather the necessary evidence. Enough to use in a court of law. An endeavor worthy of support, don't you think, Kedar? Certainly, sir. Of course, the person who does this will have contact with lepers. That means a bath every hour. Uh-huh. Leprosy is the veil behind which Staines operates. The tool he uses. You may need to prove your loyalty with conversion. You take this, you go all the way. - Banerjee. - Sir. - To help you get around. - And to get to church on time. - Have you thought of a name? - No. I like Vardanuja. - Gift of life? - Hm. Hm. Vardanuja. - David? - He gets too excited. Can't think you can push a journalist around and get away with it. He means well. They have this law for a reason. 'Cause there's people out there not doing the right thing. We have to be above reproach. Fill out an FIR. - No point. - I saw money change hands. Yeah, it happens every day, every time you buy something. The Orissa Freedom of Religion Act states that no person shall convert or attempt to convert. You're right. But David, he suffers the same disappointments that you do when people are bought. He gets frustrated. We can't make any mistakes. Somebody's always going to be trying to take this land. If that happens... who's gonna look after the home? Who's gonna defend them? Sundar? Misayel and Padma? No one would listen to David. I know. We must pray. Were you given any money? You are not registered as a Christian. My mother is a Christian. But your father was not. - Sir, see, sir. Made to sign. - It's just ownership. No, it's conversion. The affidavit was not submitted and the conversion was not registered. I will do the paperwork, sir. I will. Now you get back to work. Don't think you can take any more liberties. Come! Half the day's gone and nobody has done anything. Is that it? I can have you arrested for assault. He broke my camera! Fill out an FIR. Sir, Manav. Banerjee? Banerjee, what have you been doing? We are paying you to convert. Sir, but I cannot convert immediately. - That will be suspicious, so... - Of course. But why are you making enemies among Christians? I know what you've been doing. Now leave the girl alone. Yes, sir. - Do you know Staines? - Of course. Is he into conversions? Tries to convert you. He gives you work at the Leprosy Home. That's inducement. I can make my own decision about conversion. No inducement brings real conversion, anyway. One day I'll find the proof of him converting the tribals. Namaskar. I buy from him and I sell. Business, sir. Business. Did the church give you money to become a Christian? No. Instead I give money to church every month. My offering. As a fellow Rotarian, we believe in service before self. And Graham is no different. He's taking care of lots of people who are rejected by their own people. Let's go get dad. Come on, quick, quick, quick. - No, you won't. - Let's go get him. Whoa, whoa. Careful. Careful, careful. - Stop. - Get him! Get him! - Stop, stop, stop. - Hey, hey. Alright, come on. - I'm getting the book. - Hey. Careful. What you reading? It's a great book about a missionary. Can you read us some? I think you're gonna find it quite boring. - Please? - Please? "Missionaries constantly face expendability." What does expendability mean? That's when somebody does something somebody else thinks doesn't matter. Why? Well, for us... it's because they don't know God... because they're the ones that don't realize that they're living lives that have no eternal value. Can you read some of our books? In the series, playing along with Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Mohammad Azharuddin. The news in detail. The general secretary led the campaign against the Christian missionaries whom he claims are converting poor tribals illegally in so-called jungle camps. "Missionaries do not belong here," he said. The secretary demanded that all missionaries be required to leave India immediately for converting tribals forcibly. He cited recent violence against Christians... Ah, the man who chose to walk. Namaskar. - Must have been a long walk. - Yes. Sorry I couldn't give you a lift. No. So what can I do for you? - Oh, uh, I'm a journalist. - Yup. And I... I was amazed, shocked, actually, to see you walk into that crowd in the marketplace and physically pick up that boy. - Oh, that was nothing. - No, but it was, really. Just a sick kid, mate. It's really no big deal. - What's your name? - Manav Banerjee. Graham Staines. Nice to properly meet you. Yes. Write stories about the people who really suffer in this society, like that boy. Not about me. I... I know I didn't want the lift, but I'm still impressed with the work you do. Then write about the work, not about me. But it's your work, so... We'll talk about it when I get back. Gotta go to a jungle camp. Christian gathering... for tribal people? Yeah. It's out in Manoharpur village. Speak to you later. All arrangements are done. We're ready to go. Very good. Hi. Come on. Give her a meal. She can't stay. You think I'm harsh? She keeps bringing alcohol into the home. Lowers the effectiveness of the medication. Can't allow that. She's not contagious, so... she can go back home with her family. The village is not happy, so... There's a cure for leprosy now. About time they caught up. So, you won't help her anymore? No, I'm gonna help her, mate. And I am helping her. Getting her back home is the best thing I can do for her. Look, you want a story, right? There's a story. Sundar. Hasn't had leprosy for nearly 30 years and yet an educated man like you won't even ride in the same vehicle with him. It's... it's his karma. I couldn't risk that on my baby and my wife. He's suffered enough for his karma. He's dead, you know. It's true. He's dead. They performed the death ceremony for him back in his own village. I remember Sundar just... standing there like a ghost... saying over and over, "I'm not dead. I'm not dead." You should talk to him. Mr. Staines. What motivates you? No articles about me, right? Do you hope the lepers will become Christians? - Of course. - Hm. This is the man, Dada. He is looking for evidence. He's a journalist. He has a right to look. - Hey, dad. - Hi, dad. Boys. This is Mr. Banerjee. - Namaskar. - Namaskar. Namaskar. You're a good batsman. How old are you now? I'm six years old. Ah, maybe someday you can play for Australia. No, I want to play for India. Like Sachin. - But you're from Australia. - I'm from dust. Yes, you are. Now go on inside, wash the dust off your hands. Get some lunch, 'cause we got to go. - Mom! - Mom! We won! Bible says God created us from the dust of the Earth. Dust for dust. See you later. What? Maybe I'm just interested in his work. Mm. And maybe you'll start hugging lepers next. You ready to go to jungle camp? - Yeah. - Mm? - Come. - What did you say? - Oh. - I want you to come with us. I have to stay and look after Esther. But nice try. If you wanna take anything to play with, better go get it now. - Okay. - Uh-uh. Take your plate to the kitchen. Thank you. Oh. I'm gonna miss you too. Namaskar. Namaskar. It must be a... Must be difficult bringing up your children here in India, huh? You're a journalist? Yes, I actually work for "New..." Hm. Leave my children out of it. I didn't know what this man Mahendra was doing, but our paths were about to cross. I decided to visit the village of the woman whom Staines had sent away. Apparently, Mahendra had been at work there. What if you convert to Christianity? Staines can help you, protect you. - Not out here, sir. - Surely. The village elders will decide tonight, sir. Your wife drew water from the well. She wanted to save the crop, sir. Don't you know it's expensive to have the well purified? But she's cured, sir. How do we know the curse is lifted? Because she's cured, sir. Maybe we are all under a curse. Because we have not dealt properly with such people in the past. - Make him pay. - Make him pay! Unh-unh-unh. He cannot pay. Does anybody want him to stay in the village? Will anyone speak for him? I will. Namaskar. My name is Manav Banerjee. - I'm a journalist. - He's not from the village. The government clinics and hospitals provide medicines that heal other illnesses. You accept those treatments. Then why not all? This one is working for the missionaries. Mahendra, let him speak. Hmm. The government medicines have cured her. They want him to take her back, so... It was the missionaries who said she was cured. So the government will agree with the missionaries. Government. Government does what the missionaries want. - Then why do you blame him? - You are a Christian. No, I'm just speaking for this man. You argue like the missionaries! Well, that's what you think and I can't do anything... This man will write in his newspaper that you are fools and ignorant farmers. That is not true... Then he will pressurize the government to take the leper woman back. - That's not true at all! That... - We have to stop him! We have to stop him writing these lies! Just wait! Listen! Listen to what I've written in my research! Just listen to me! "The traditional lifestyle in the villages is disintegrating. Farmers are leaving their lands and families. Why?" - The missionaries. - Yes. "The missionaries have been operating out of India for hundreds of years now and they've undermined thousands of years of traditions. Converts to Christianity no longer respect feast days, make sacrifices to the village Gods or submit to the village elders." "No wonder there is social disintegration, failure. But do the missionaries ever get the blame for this?" "Exactly. No one ever blames them. The missionaries divide and conquer causing the people of India to fight with each other. But this is like attacking the chickens when they do not lay eggs." "It is the snake who's disturbing the chicken. That must be destroyed. When a snake takes the chicken or the eggs, you do not attack the chicken, but you lay in wait for the snake and cut off its head. The people of India need to protect their tradition by cutting off the heads of these snakes, the true enemies of a successful India." Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! We need to cut the head of the snake! At the time, I was merely relieved to have escaped a beating, at least. I don't know how far they would have gone. I also had no idea that my words may have a consequence. If only I'd known how far my... my random thought had gone in the mind of that man. That I didn't know. Manav. - I'm sorry. - Shh, shh, shh. It's not your fault. You did not cause this. Understand? Rest now. Hmm. Gotta go to a jungle camp. It's out in Manoharpur village. Well, I didn't expect to see you out here. - Research. - Well, this is how we do it. Ah! Ah! Run! Keep going! Good boy. Careful. Mr. Staines... why do you do this? I was 16 when I first saw this picture. Couldn't get it out of my mind. Boy my age from here with no hope. You have no fear. That boy you picked up the other... Uh, the first time I was so scared, I nearly threw up. Or maybe it was just the curry. Sundar. You know, the old guy. He was the first. He was just trying to get back to his village to see his son one last time before he died. God wouldn't let me ride on. And these days, we have a medical cure. You could do it, you know. Come on, Laki. Come on! You can put your hands down. The government provides medicine now. - Yup. - We don't need you anymore. Why do you stay? It's my calling. And for people like Sundar. He's got no family. That's his karma. You can call the leprosy karma, but the way we treat him... that's not his karma. People are afraid of the curse. So fear, unfounded fear... prevents the people from doing good. And what you do is good? I hope so. And your good converts people. Sometimes. My wife's in hospital. The doctors advise a transfer to the city for surgery. We cannot afford to pay. What if I become a... Christian? That would be a forced conversion. So fear... unfounded fear prevents you. I'll pray about it. Come on, Laki! Come on! Come on, Laki! Come on, run! Laki! Come on! Faster, faster. I know you can do it! You can make it! You're nearly there! Come on, run, run, run, run! Keep going! Come on! The kids are doing good. Could be an inducement. You know, Jesus healed ten lepers once. How many you think came back to thank Him? - Not all? - One. But he still healed them all. So will you help my wife? God's the one that can really help. Why don't you ask Him? I'm asking you. Like I said, I'll pray about it. Why don't you check out the preaching? Good crowd today. I promise to come back and thank you. - Hi, dad. - Hey, boys. - Hi. - I saw you out there. - Are you done today? - Yeah, you did real well. - Thanks, dad. Thanks. - Hm. Mahendra? Eh. Journalist. What are you doing here in Manoharpur? Hey, don't be nervous. No, I... Just surprised to see you here, that's all. Are you sure? You are not Christian? What if I was? Because you only said we shouldn't blame chickens. Why are you here though? We are performing a drama. Want to come? Got it? Real good. Okay. - Hi. - Hi. You here for the evening dance, or just more research? Okay, I got it. I'm getting it. Mr. Staines. Do you ever worry that you might be in danger out here? Yeah. Diarrhea. Have you heard of a man called Mahendra? Which one? He doesn't like missionaries. Being a missionary is not a popularity contest. - You heard something? - I'm not certain. Only two things in life are certain, mate. Death and taxes. It's worth being prepared for both. Your wife just had a baby? Don't work so hard. Get back to your family. I will. See you later. Where's she? Manav. Shanti. The bed was needed for a patient who had paid. - I'm so sorry. - It's fine. I will be right back. Excuse me. Haven't the bills been paid for bed number 6? - No. - I was told they have been. Here. And this. - Hello. - Sir, Banerjee. Where have you been, Banerjee? Sir, my wife was left out there on a stretcher, sir. Why are you telling me? Sir, you said you'll pay the hospital. I paid. She's young. She'll be fine. Sir, I can't work if my wife isn't cared for. Here's a thought. If you're spending time with her, why should I pay the hospital? Sir, I'm working, sir. I'm paying you to convert, Banerjee. To get some real evidence. Sir, but if I find evidence, evidence is evidence, right? You do what I'm paying you for and I look after your wife. Sir, but... Hello? Sir? Let's go to bed. - Namaskar. - Namaskar. Come on, boys. Alright, boys, ready to call it a day? Are you sure you have nothing on a Mahendra? If he's not dead, I don't know. See, I'm sure he's trouble. Oh, is he also converting illegally? I saw him buying alcohol. I saw him at Manoharpur... That area is not under our jurisdiction. - Who's it under? - Um, um, Thakurmunda. - Can you call them? - And tell them what? J... just to check on him. I'm sure he's trouble. You, you are the troublemaker. I can give you a bed for the night. You want?

What happened? Three dead bodies. His kids too? Two small children. Only two things in life are certain, mate. Death and taxes. Maybe someday you're gonna play for Australia. No, I want to play for India. Like Sachin. But you're from Australia. I'm from dust. Manav. Manav! Stop, stop! Where have you been? - Manoharpur. - And? Come. Get in. He's been murdered. Staines? Yes. Then not murdered. He was killed for converting tribals. But, sir, the man was... He must have done something. Provoked it somehow. There's no evidence. Find some. What? Conversions. Inducements. People will talk now. Banerjee. Staines was into conversions. I'm not saying he should have been killed, but... actually this sends out a good message. Teaches the Christians a lesson. Stops them from converting. Think about it. We just need to find some evidence. Account books, money in, money out, title deeds. Seek and ye shall find. What about the boys? His sons? They killed them also. They would have grown up to convert... like their father. We have to be strong, Banerjee. We must print the truth. Staines was not a hero, not a martyr. Do you know a man named Mahendra? No. Mom? Have you heard something more, mom? No. I'm just... I just needed a minute. All these people coming. Someone must know something. Perhaps, yes. I wish they could tell us. Sweetheart, come on now. No moping about. Your dad could walk through that door any minute. Alright? God's in control even when we don't understand. I'm with them. Gladys is here. You have more news? Gladys... y... you need to be strong for Esther. You mean he's dead? Yes. What about the boys? Let the children go! Let the children go! Let the children go! It seems we've been left alone. Whoever did this, we will forgive them. Good morning, and this is coming straight from Orissa. Fresh violence is reported to have broken out against Christians. This time at a so-called jungle camp run by Australian missionary Graham Staines in a remote part of the state of Orissa. The gathered Christians were allegedly attacked in the dead of the night and vehicles belonging to the Christians... Christian missionaries are forcibly... Looking for something? The account ledger's over there. What did he give you to convert? He's just been killed. So you can tell me now. Doesn't matter anymore. - Why did you convert? - You want the truth? Truth always seems to cost something. You know... from when I got leprosy to when Dada found me, in all those years, he was the only person who touched me. Is touching lepers an inducement? You must be desperate to be touching me! Just tell me the truth about his conversions. - Truth? - Tell me! Graham showed me God's love. Why wouldn't I convert? - So that you could stay here! - I saw God's love in Graham. And you know you could stay here only if you converted! I never converted! The truth, I am not a Christian. Agya? Is it true, agya? Are you afraid? Is there something you're hiding, old man? - Nobody knows. - What? - Why didn't you convert? - My son, I suppose. He denies that I exist. His name is Babulal, right? He changed his name. He's a newspaper editor now. I tried to see him. He calls me the mad fool. Nothing? Well... for now, just write about the conversions. No. It's not true. Not illegally. He converted, Banerjee. - It is enough. - Enough to kill him? And his children? Look, the... the villagers are desperate. They need a voice. We have to be their voice. You just don't have enough evidence yet. Prove to me it's true, sir. Conversions? Just spoke to a man who claims he has a son by the name of Babulal. Prove to me he's lying. Come and meet him. A leper. A convert and a liar. He never converted. - He always hoped his son... - Raj. - Your father. - I have no father! No father, huh? And you don't know Mahendra? I can't prove it, but I know Mahendra is involved. And I know you know it! - Raj. - Stay there, Raj! Seek and you will find. You were talking about the truth, weren't you? - You're finished. - No, no, no. - You will print my article. - Never. Yes, you will. On the front page. I shall fax you my article.

Yes, I gave Mishra what he wanted to print... but I could not leave it there. I could not leave lies about Staines on the page. Since Mishra would not print the truth... I could provide that truth... to others. I didn't know if it would even be printed... or what the consequence might be... but Shanti was with me on this. She wanted me to tell the truth, no matter what. Nobody knew that what I had said at that night in the village had in some way led to the murders except me. And for that... I needed to ask for forgiveness. I'm so sorry. I said things, I wrote things that were not true. What things? About Graham. Do you have children? A baby. A daughter. The true story about Graham Staines... was very different from what I'd first imagined. I wondered what this place would be like without him. Graham Staines was a missionary by his own admission. The question is not whether he converted the others or not, the question is whether he converted others by use of force, inducement, or fraudulent means. For that, though I have searched and searched, I have found no evidence. I have found, however, that Staines was indeed into conversion. He pursued conversion with outstanding success. Through 35 years of discouragements, difficulties, disappointments, oh, yes, he converted. He converted worthlessness into significance. He converted the hopeless into the hope-filled. For 35 years, he converted lepers... into human beings. Many of us have gone through trials and suffering. But God knows what each one of us is going through. Psalm 46:1 says, "God is our refuge and strength and ever present help in trouble." God is the one who encourages us and strengthens us to forgive. Unforgiveness, however, brings bitterness which affects... our health and our relationships. Jesus taught us to forgive, but forgiveness doesn't take away the consequences. Because Jesus lives, I can face tomorrow.
