Here then shall I see you again, Constanze, my joy! Oh heaven, hear my plea! Restore my peace! Oh love, I have suffered all too many sorrows Now grant me joys instead And bring me to my goal. But how am I to get into the palace, how to see her, how to speak to her? He who has found a sweetheart true and faithful to him... should reward her with a thousand kisses; sweeten her whole life... be her comfort and her friend. Trallalera, trallalera! Hey, friend! Isn't this Pasha Selim's country house? But to keep her faithful, let him carefully lock his sweetheart in; for the flighty creatures snatch at every butterfly.., and sip all too gladly at other's wine Trallalera, trallalera. Hey, old fellow! Can't you hear me? Is this the palace of Pasha Selim? Above all, when the moon is shining friends, keep a watchful eye on her! Some fine young gentlemen may lurk and tempt the silly girl And then good night to fidelity! Trallalera, trallalera A pox on you and your song! I'm tired of your singing. Just listen to a word! Villain, why get so worked up, so excited, so puffed up? What do you want? Hurry up, I've got to go. Is this Pasha Selim's house? Eh? Is this Pasha Selim's house? This is Pasha Selim's house. But wait!One word! I can't tarry, I'm in a hurry. Are you in his service, friend? Eh? Are you in his service, friend? I am in his service, friend. How can I speak to Pedrillo Who works for him here? That scoundrel, whose neck I'd like to wring? Find him yourself if you want him What churlish old boor! Here's another gallows-bird! You're wrong, he is an honest man. So honest that I'd impale him on a spit You can't know him properly I'd have him roasted today Well enough! He's really a good chap His head should be stuck on a pike Just a moment What is it now? I'd like to... ... To come skulking round the house... ...and steal the girls? Off with you, We don't want your sort here. You're crazy to insult me to my face with such rancour! Take it easy, I know your kind. Spare me your venom and threats Go to the devil! Or else, you'll be awarded the bastinado without mercy! There's still time! You're out of your mind! What a way to answer my questions! Do use some sense! How is it going, Osmin? Isn't the Pasa back yet? Go and see if you want to know. Outlook stormy again? Did you pick figs for me? Poison for you, damned parasite! What have I done to you? Let's make peace for once! Make peace? With you? I'd like to strangle you! But why? Yes, why? Because I can't stand you! These profligate puppies.. Who do nothing but ogle women! I'd rather have the devil All they ever do is watch us at our work, But a face like that doesn't deceive me Your tricks,your wiles, youe schemes, your guiles.. ...all are known to me. You'll have to get up early to get the better of me... for I know what's what. Yes, by the Prophet's beard, I'll not rest, day or night... till I see you killed. Watch out how you may What have I done to you? You have the face of a gallows-bird, and that is enough! First beheaded, Then hanged, Then impaled On red hot spikes, Then burned, Then bound and drowned Finally flayed. Good riddance, you damned watchdog! Pedrillo! Is it possible? Is it you? Did one of my letters reach you? Pedrillo, is Constanze alive? She's alive! Since that dreadful day when our ship was captured by pirates we've suffered badly Fortunately, Pasha Selim bought all three of us: your Constanze, my Blonde and me. He had us brought here to his country house Donna Constanze has become his favourite. His favourite! What are you saying?Favourite? Just a moment! As far as I know, Constanze hasn't yet yielded to this renegade So... ...Is Constanze said to be true to me? Of course, dear sir! But Heaven knows how it is with my Blonde She is pining away with a hateful old rascal... whom the Pasha gave her to and perhaps.. I dare not even think about it! The old man who just went inside? The same! This spy, this exploiter! Pedrillo! Yes, yes, we can't waste time on that now But how are we to get out of here? I've taken care of that! My ship is anchored outside the harbour Just a minute! First we must get the lassies... the lady and the girl, and that's not so easy! The Pasha will be returning soon from a boating trip. I'll introduce you to him as a talented architect. Architect? Building and gardening are his hobbies! Through my skill... my modicum of skill in gardening I gained his favour I may even talk to the ladies. Pedrillo! Stay calm. Costanza is with him. Costanze is with him? I'll now go and meet the Pasha Constanze! to see you once more! Oh how eagerly, oh, how ardently.. ...my lovesick heart is beating! But the glad tears of our reunion.. will erase the anxious pain of separation I already tremble and waver, quake and falter My breast swells to bursting! Is that her whisper? I'm all on fire. Was that her sigh? My cheeks are aglow Does love deceive me? Was it a dream? Quick, hide! The Pasha is coming! Raise songs to our great Pasha, lift your voices in acclaim And from the shore, let the joyous sound of our songs re-echo! Waft towards him, Cooling breezes, Flow more gently, turbulent waters! Let your song carry towards him, Greet him with song, winged choirs, tell him of the heartfelt joy of love! Still sad, Constanze? Still in tears? Say, can nothing bring you peace... nothing move your heart? You know, I could command you, I could force you But no, Constanze,no I want you yourelf to give me your heart Say, Constanze, say: what holds you back? Ah, I was in love, and so happy, knowing nothing of the pain of love I swore to be true to my beloved, I gave him my whole heart But how quickly my joy vanished! Separation was my unhappy lot. And now my eyes overflow with tears, Sorrow dwells in my bosom. Her grief, her tears, her steadfastness enchant my heart still more just make her love the more desirable to me My Lord, this young man.. What is it? Forgive me! This young man studied architecture in Italy He heart of your power and wealth..and has come to offer you his services as an architect I will see what you can do. See to his needs. I will send for you again tomorrow. Pedrillo! Easy, easy! I have seen her! The first step is made! Come with me into the garden I have seen her! Be careful, there are eyes and ears everywhere!. Where are you going? Inside! What does that mug want? Back you go! Just a minute! He is in the Pasha's service. He could be in the hangman's services, he's not coming in! But he's to go in! If he puts but one foot over the threshold.. Just watch us walk in! We'll see about that! March!Take yourself off! Or you'll find the bastinado Will be at your service! My, wouldn't it be a pity To treat us like that! Don't come any nearer... Stand away from the door, We're going in. Be off with you! Make way. we're going in! ...or you'll feel my fist No, no, no, no! Once and for all, no! You can't treat European girls like that! With them you have to act quite differently With tenderness and coaxing, Kindness and gaiety... ...It is easy to win a gentle maiden's heart But boorish commands, bluster, abuse and scolding... ...will very quickly banish bith love and faithfulness Tenderness? Coaxing? We're in Turkey! I am the master, you my slave! Your slave? Yes. I, your slave? Say that just once more! I could go crazy! Have you forgotten that the Pasha gave you to me as a slave? Pasha this, Pasha that! Girls aren't goods to be given away! I am an Englishwoman, born to be free! I order you...to love me this minute! Don't be ridiculous! Don't make me use force! Force?My mistress is the Pasha's beloved It takes only a word from me... and you'll get fifty lashes on the soles of your feet! So get out! She is a devil! I'm going, but I advise you to avoid that scoundrel Pedrillo. Be off with you, don't order me about, you know that I can't stand it! Promise me! The very idea! Damn it! Leave me alone! By Allah, I'm not moving from here... ...until you swear to obey me Not likely! You'll see soon Not even if you were the great Mogul O Englishmen, what fools you are To let your women have their way! A girl born to freedom will never slavishly take orders! How plagued and harassed one is when one gets a hussy like this! A girl born to freedom will never slavishly take orders! Even when freedom is lost she remains monarch of the world! Now be off! Is this how you speak to me? How else? Then I'll stay here! Some other time, now get away! Who ever saw such insolence! You'll get your eyes scrached out if you stay here any longer Gently now, I'll be going before you lay about you What sorrow reigns in my breast... ...since the day when my luck forsook me! O, Belmonte! where are those joys which once I knew at your side? The pains of aching yearning ...have replaced them in my afflicted breast Sorrow has become my lot ...for I am torn from you. Like the cankered rose Like grass in winter moss My sad life withers away. Even to the breeze I cannot tell my soul's bitter anguish, For the breeze is unwilling to carry it... ...and breathes all my laments Back into my afflicted heart. Oh, my dear lady! Still so sad? Still no news, still no hope! And tomorrow... I dare not think about it! Constanze! Now, Constanze, have you thought about our conversation? I shall always think as I do now Respect you, yes But love you, never! And you do not tremble at the power I wield over you? No! Death is all I have to expect Oh, no! Not death, no.. Torture of every kind may await me I scorn agony and pain Nothing shall shake my resolve. I would tremble only if I were untrue to him Be moved to pity! Spare me! The blessings of heaven Shall be your reward. But you are determined. Willingly, unflinchingly I choose every pain and grief. Well then, command, coerce me, Roar, fulminate, rage, Death will liberate me in the end. Blondo! What is it? News that will delight you. The end of our slavery is at hand Can you imagine, Blonde, Belmonte has arrived! What?Belmonte? Is he here? Yes, I've introduce him to the Pasha as an architect. I must tell Costanze! Hear me first, Blonde! Belmonte has a ship nearby he's decided ... we've decided to carry you off this very night. Pedrillo, that deserves a kiss! I must go to Costanze! Wait! At midnight Belmonte will come with a ladder to Costanze's window... and I to yours, and then off we go! Splendid! I must go to Constanze! But what about Osmin? Here is a sleeping-draught that I'll mix into his wine But can't Costanze speak to Belmonte at least? As soon as it's dark he'll come here into the garden. Now go! What joy I'll be bringing her! What bliss, what rapture is aroused in my heart! I could jump for joy to bring her the good news... And with laughter and jest prophesy joy and jubilation ...to her poor despairing heart Oh, if it were only all over! Well, let's risk it! it's now or never! Forward to the fray! Into battle! Only faint hearts are afraid. Should I tremble? Should I waver? Should I not boldly risk my life? No, let me be resolute! Only faint hearts are afraid. You're having a good time here! Things must be going awfully well Merriment and wine sweeten the harshest slavery. Wine? Truly! Your father Mahomet was barking up the wrong tree...when he forbade you wine. Were it not for that stupid law... ...you'd have to drink with me, willy nilly Wine? With you? Fire and fury! What of fire and fury! Forget your old grudge for once!Be sensible! Look: two bottles of Cyprus wine They'll taste splendid to me! Taste the big bottle too! Do you think I've put poison in it? Here, watch me drink. Now, Osmin, do you still have doubts? Don't you trust me yet? Fie there! Then I'll go! No! Mahomet's long since been asleep! Vivat Bacchus, Long live Bacchus, Bacchus was a worthy man! Shall I risk it? Shall I dare? Supposing Allah sees me? What's the good of hesitating? Down with it, without further question! Well, I've done it, now it's down! That's what I call daring! Hurrah for girls, fair and dark ones! A health to them! That tastes splendid! That tastes marvellous! I call that a drink fit for the gods! Vivat Bacchus! Long live Bacchus who invented wine! True! Wine is a beautiful drink; and our great prophet Mahomet shouldn't hold it against me It's a marvellous thing, wine! Isn't it, brother Pedrillo? Right, brother Osmin, right! It makes one so lovely... ...so merry Haven't you any more, dear brother? Old chap, don't drink so much, it easily goes to your head! Don't worry, I'm absolutely sober! It's working? But you're not to give me away, dear brother for if Mahomet, no, if the Pasha knew.. Dear Blonde, now at last: yes or no? It's time I got rid of him! Come, old chap, let's get some sleep. Sleep?Aren't you ashamed, dear brother? Who wants to go to sleep? It's scarcely dawn yet! Come on now, so the Pasha won't catch us! Yes, yes , a bottle! The great Pasha! Good night, dear brother! He's got a skin full! It's still three hours till midnight. By then he can have woken up again Pedrillo! Come, dear master! Where is Constanze? Here she comes! Ah, Belmonte, my life! Ah, Constanza, my life! Is it possible? What enchantment to clasp you to my breast After so many days of suffering! What bliss to find you! Now all grief must vanish! Oh how my heart rejoices! See, tears of joy are flowing. Fairest, let me kiss them away! May they be our last tears! This very day you shall be free! So, Blonde, do you understand? Everything is ready for flight. On the stroke of twelve we'll be there. Don't worry, nothing will go wrong I'll be counting the minutes; If only the moment had come! At last the sun of hope is shining through the gloomy sky. Filled with rapture, joy and bliss We see the end of our suffering! But yet, along with my joy My heart still feels..many a secret care! What is it, dearest? Say! Quick, explain yourself. Keep nothing back from me! It's said .. It's said .. you are . . . But Blonda, the ladder! Are you worth that much? Blockhead, have you gone daft? You'd do better to turn the question round! But Master Osmin?? But Master Osmin?? Out with it! Will you not explain? It's said... But Osmin... ...you are.. But Osmin.. Go on! Out with it! Will you not explain? I will, but don't be angry Hasn't Osmin in fact... If, after what I've heard... ...as might well be believed I dare to ask you... tested his rights as master...quaking and trembling: and exercised them on you? Do you love the Pasha? That'd be a bad bargain! Oh, how you wound me! There's your answer! Now I know! Constanza, oh forgive me! You're unworthy of me! You ask me if I've been true? The knave even asks if I've been true to him! Someone told Belmonte that I'd given the Pasha my love That Blonde is faithful, I'd swear by all the devils. Constanza is true to me, of that there is no doubt. As soon as women fret if we think them unfaithfull... Then they are really true And free from all reproach. If men harbour doubts about our honour, And regards us with suspicion, this is not to be borne Dearest Blonde, do forgive me! See, now I stake my faith more on your fidelity Than on my head! Ah, Constanza, my life! Can you ever forgive me For asking that question? Belmonte, could you believe... ...That anyone could steal from you this heart which beats for you alone? No, I can't forgive you ...for thinking me capable of that and with that stupid old idiot! Ah, forgive me! Ah, forgive me! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! If you're sorry, I'll forgive you! Good, let that be an end to it! Long live love Long live love! Let it alone be held dear! Let nothing fan the flame of jealousy! Wherever is my master? Pedrillo! At last!Come along! Is everything ready? Everything! I've only to take a look around the house! What for?To see if everyone's asleep For time to time a Janissary guard makes the rounds here Psst, stay calm! Oh, Constanze! When tears of joy are flowing, love smiles sweetly on lovers To kiss their cheeks is love's greatest, happiest reward Ah, Costanze, to see you.. ...and in rapture and bliss to press you to my faithful heart.. ...is a prize no royal crown could match! Ah, this blissful rediscovery made me experience... ...what pain separation causes. Come!Just a moment! Get on with it! Watch out so we won't be taken by surprise! I must first give the signal In a Moorish land a lovely maid was taken captive Pink and white was she, black her hair Day and night, she sighed and wept bitterly She longed to be rescued. From a foreign land there came a young knight The maiden lamented loud to him. Ah, cried he, I'll risk my head and honour to rescue her. That is enough, Pedrillo. It's not my fault they're late. Stay at your post. I'll come to you at dead of night, let me in quickly, dearest! I fear neither lock nor guard, Holla there, listen at midnight you shall be freed He kept his word:at the stroke of twelve the bold knight was there She gently gave him her soft hand, In the early hours her cell was found empty; She was off and away! She's opened up, Sir! Quick, the ladder!I'm coming! - Belmonte! - Constanze! Here I am! Quiet, quiet! Psst!It's life or death! Oh, Constanze! Now I have you again! All of you, again! Nothing shall part us evermore. Let's go!No chatter! Hurry to the harbour! I'll be close behind you. Blonde! Blonde, open up! Vivat Bacchus, long live Bacchus, Bacchus was a worthy man... This , left here! Hurrah for girls, fair and dark ones Tarnation! What's that? A ladder! Oh, a ladder Someone must have climbed into the house! Climbed into the house? Help!Guards! Help!Murderers!Thieves! Cerule, Pedrillo! we're done for! Wait, rascal!You shan't escape me! Let go of me! Pedrillo! Your head shall roll! The company is growing all the time! Here's some gold for you! Gold? Yes.Let us go! Gold! We don't need your gold your heads shall roll! Take them away to the Pasha! Have mercy! Oh, no! I've long been waiting for this moment! Ah, how I shall triumph when they lead you up to the gallows and string you up by the neck! I shall gambol, laugh and skip and croon a little song of joy... ...for then I shall be rid of you. However softly you creep, You damned harem mice.. ...Our ears soon detect you! And before you can escape you find yourself in our trap and receive your just deserts.. Oh, how I shall triumph ... Osmin! Osmin! Master? What is it, Osmin? What's this uproar? Master! Pedrillo and this great architect wanted to kidnap our women! Thanks to my watchfulness I've caught them again Look, they're being brought in now! Constanze! Is this how you abuse my trust? I'm guilty in your eyes, sir. But he is is my beloved. Punish me, but spare his life! You still dare to plead for him? More than that:to die for him! Pasa! Never before did this knee bend before a man But behold, I am prostate at your feet and beg your sympathy Set a ransom for Costanze and me I come from a great, wealthy family My name is Lostados. Lostados! The Commandant of Oran was called Lostados Do you know him? Yes!He is my father! Your father? What blessed day! To have the son of my worst enemy in my power! Listen, wretch! Da! I know him well. And I hate him. Your barbaric father drove me from my native land? He robbed me of my beloved,of honor, of wealth, of everything. He destroyed my every happiness. And now I have you, his only son, in my power! What would your father do if he were in my place? My fate would be pitiable. So shall it be! I shall deal with you as he dealt with me! Osmin, come! Guard them there What a fate! O, torment of the soul! Has everything conspired against me? Ah, Constanze! Through me you are lost! What grief! Ah, beloved, let that not torment you. What is death? A passage to peace! And then, at your side, a foretaste of bliss. Angelic soul! How gentle and good you are! You pour balm into my anguished heart You soften the pain of death for me And alas,I drag you to the grave! You are to die for me! Ah, Constanze, how can I dare still to look you in the eyes? I have brought about your death! You have given your life for me! I alone brought you to your death And may I not die with you? This command brings me bliss! Ah, beloved! to live for you was all I wished and strove for. Without you, it is only pain for me to stay longer in the world I will suffer anything gladly... I will meet death in peace and joy ...since I am at your side For you beloved... For you beloved... ..I gladly give my life! Oh what rapture! To die with one's beloved ..Is rapture and bliss! One can quit this world in the joy of loving glances Master, we are done for! Rescue is out of the question! I'll definitely be soaked in oil, then impaled on a spit Now, Lostados, are you ready for your sentence? Yes, Pasha. I'm prepared for everything Take your revenge Revenge? I detested your father much too much ...ever to follow in his footsteps Take your freedom, take Constanze, Sail home, tell your father that you were in my power, ...and that I set you free it is a far greater pleasure ..to avenge an injustice with good deeds ...than to repay crimes with crimes My Lord! Go! And at lest be more humane than your father My Lord! Silence! I hope you may never regret having rejected my heart My Lord! may we also crave your mercy? Master, no mercy! He has earned death a hundred times over! Then let him find it in his native land. Escort all of them to the ship! Is he taking my Blonde away with him? Calm yourself. If you can't win someone by kindness... it's better to get rid of them. And this forthwith! I'll never fail to appreciate your mercy, I'll be forever grateful At all times and places I'll call you great and noble Anyone who could forget such mercy should be regarded with contempt! Anyone who could forget such mercy should be regarded with contempt! Even in love's embrace, I'll never forget the gratitude I owe My heart, now dedicated to love, will also cherish grateful thanks Anyone who could forget such mercy should be regarded with contempt! If I could ever forget how near I was to being throttled ...and all the other dangers I'd run as if my brain were on fire Anyone who could forget such mercy should be regarded with contempt! Accept my thanks, Lord Pasha. Health and happiness to you! Osmin, fate has willed it that I must leave you for ever Anyone who, like you, only quarrels should be regarded with contempt! We should burn these dogs who so shamefully deceived us It's no longer to be borne My tongue is almost paralysed in my longing to order their reward: First beheaded, Then hanged, Then impaled on red hot spikes, Then burned,then bound and drowned, finally flayed. Nothing is as hateful as revenge; To be generous, merciful, kind and selflessly to forgive... ...is the mark of a noble soul Anyone who could forget this should be regarded with contempt! Long live Pasha Selim! Let honour be his due! May his gracious brow be resplendent with jubilation and with fame.
