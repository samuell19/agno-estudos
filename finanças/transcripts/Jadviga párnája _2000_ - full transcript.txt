MAFILM presents Hungarian Motion Picture Foundation UJ DIALOG Film Studio National Radio and Television Commission Hungarian Television DUNA Television production manager artistic advisor Annie, sweetheart, where've you been? How come your boots are wet with dew? I was in the fields scything grass, my darling. No, we must sing Jadviga, not Annie! Starring JADVIGA'S PILLOW A film by Krisztina Deak from a novel by Pal Zavada cast costumes sets sound editor music director of photography screenplay Ondris! Listen! Heave a big sigh for my sake. A real sigh of longing: Jadviga! - I can't wait for you to come! - I'm going to meet her at noon. - Help, I must rush! - Noon's far away. Farewell to bachelorhood comes once in a lifetime! She sowed beet, she sowed poppies, she sowed juniper... Her knees were white, her cunt curly... ...he fondled her chachurdyitshku! What's that? - He sat her down... ...na lavitshku! - He fondled her... ...chachurdyitshku! Haruhudyi... Chachurdyitshku! That's what you call it in Slovak? And how d'you call it in Jewish? Like this? Will you call it like that? - Will you do this? - To Jadviga's? No, she's been brought up by the English Frauleins in Germany! But Jadviga's coming home to be a Slovak bride. - Gregor! Wait for me! I'm off to meet her! - Come on then. I've brought everything. Let's go home. - Let's go up the tower! - For pigeons' eggs. This is wonderful! He sat her down na lavitshku, fondled her chachurdyitshku! The egg, the egg! - Ondris! Imitate the reverend! - After the wedding, yes. I beg you admonish these profane ones! Scandal. Disgrace, my brothers in Christ. You drink till morning. - Drunken pigs! - Keep still! The Lord will vent his wrath on you! I wash my hands of you! They've arrived! Jadviga! God bless them! Ondris! Come. Captain! Isn't he like my poor husband at our wedding? Were you at Apovka's wedding? Tell me does that priest of yours speak any Hungarian? He speaks it, but doesn't enjoy it... Your Reverend! - Szilagyi. - Pleased to meet you. I wish the groom's father were alive! I'd rather speak Hungarian if you don't mind. I knew him well. How happy he'd have been to see his son and his ward united... Was he the bride's guardian? He had her raised in Germany! - My friend must be very happy. - He is. Pali! Pali! Enough! Not that again! A march! Let the bride dance! Dance with the Slovaks, not just Jews... A bit of drink and you're Jew-bashing! Ondris! Dance with us, gorgeous! For the last time! I'll go over there. Who's my friend? Irmus! - Are you happy? - Yes. I should hope so. Just like his father. But you're getting him young. How he'll crush you in his arms! He'll have more fire than Apovka! You've drunk. Out of your mind! So, here is the cake. I hope you enjoy it. Take my wife to dance. No, I will. Come on. Jadviga! I should have picked you up and eloped with you. You? Why? That's the custom. It doesn't matter. I'll do it. No peeping. Slowly, slowly... Ondrisko! Let's get used to each other. Be patient with me. Ondrisko, not yet. Easy. Easy. When I was a girl I used to wish Apovka would bring me here. He brought you home once. For your confirmation. Take it out of my pocket. The pine trees. The churchyard. I haven't seen them since. Was it here? - Don't you recognize it? - I recognize you. You were such a sweet little noodle! Always wanting to sit on my lap and smell me. As you are doing now? I was afraid you'd go to the Land of the English, as an English Fraulein. Land of the English! I said you were a noodle. A little Slovak noodle. It's strange there's no water here. But there is... The thermal water spring. Or did you think there was a sea here? - No, I didn't. - The Sea of the Hungarian Plain! No, but I dreamt about Apovka. And I looked for the sea at the bottom of the garden. I so regret I couldn't take leave of Apovka. I saw oleanders in flower when he took me to Florence. After my matriculation. He took you to Italy? It's a pity he didn't bring you. Anyway, I've got him to thank for you. Because he took me to you in Stralsund that summer. I was meant to visit Franci. He promised to take me to the girls! Shame on you! We must go to my parents' grave too. We'll go... Soon. Someone will see us. Aim at the window! That's it. Come on in. I found something among father's old photos. It's there on the shelf. Gyorgy Osztatni - engagement. I just can't work it out. Your mother looks so like Jadviga... It's not my mother, it's Jadviga's. Were they really engaged? And? They broke up. Hell knows why. This Maria made a sudden marriage to Endre Palkovits. And Apovka married Mamovka. Jadviga's parents died when she was born. Why? Was there an epidemic? Some sort of wound went septic. - Her mother's? - No her father's. Her mother died of puerperal fever apparently. But a year after the birth. So maybe it was a case of caustic soda. Please come here. One, two, three... Now! Good morning! What are you doing? How can you behave like this? How can you behave like this? Dreadful! Scandalous! Lieutenant, sir! When does the train leave for that dog Serbia? I've just been given it... I've invited you before. Come to one of our meetings. - You mean... - You belong... with us. You're Slovaks, are you not? You have a duty towards our mother country. We'll have our own country when the war ends. You mean... us Slovaks? Because the Hungarians snarl at us saying: Stupid Slovaks! Be prepared! You mean us? For what? For what, for what? We don't stay passive once the Slovak State has been founded. We the Slovaks of the border "outposts" of the Great Plain. You understand? We'll have a meeting. I'll send word. But keep it dark. What was all that about? Ondrisko! I haven't seen you for ages! Because you've been avoiding us. How come you weren't at our wedding? - I was away. Duty bound... - Of course. A troublesome inheritance case. - But how are you? - I'm all right. Sprinkled all the girls? You've lost weight. You look a bit strained. Don't worry about me, I'm fine. We were talking about the old days in Stralsund. That fine coast. Jadviga often thinks of the sea. Pity that your father never took you with him. But he did. He took me to see Jadviga. What did you grow a moustache for? A lawyer with a moustache. - Thank you. - I'll bring some more. - Really delicious! - I'm glad. How did it happen? I haven't even congratulated you. So you want to produce sausages... After the war. It'd be good to travel. Are you going anywhere this summer? We're full of military trains. So I prefer to stay put. Oh, no, I don't. I'll just make the five o'clock. I'm off. - Dear Ondris! - Bye. I kiss your hand, Jadviga. You're always hugging that pillow. My mother embroidered it. I've slept on it ever since. Then it knows more than I do. Ondrisko! It's not a good time! - What have I done wrong? - You haven't done anything. It's all my fault. What d'you mean? I have to confess... it's not the first time for me. What? Don't spoil everything. It's you, not me. But I... not like that. Not at all. What is it you haven't told me? I once loved someone. But he disappointed me. He broke his word. Broke his word? What word? Who was it? D'you hear? When was this? Who was it? - You misunderstand, I... - Just tell me who it was! At last! At long last! What have you done? And just at full moon, on the day of my trouble? Please... don't be angry. I'm sorry! - I was completely mad. - Yes, you were. And I have to bear with it. With everything. Get up now. You have to bear with everything? And all the things I do for you? - Accusing and humiliating? - I've said I'm sorry. Aren't you sorry for what you denied me? Don't shout at me. I've had enough... of the whole thing. Are you threatening me? Me, who adores you? Like last night? Like an animal? I know I was wild. But perhaps it's right that at last... it's the natural thing. In the stable. It's natural there. You can force your mares! You peasant! I appease you and you degrade me! You won't see me again till you apologise to me. Zelenak! Get ready. Go to the farm for Mrs. Hulina! Should I do everything? While her ladyship mooches all day! And makes a fool of my son. Just as she did of his father. His father would never have behaved like his son. And it wasn't me who made a fool of Apovka. All right, Breeze. Easy, easy now. - Leave it, I'll do it. - Hold the horse. Just like your father. He once drove his horse hard like this. - What? - Because of Jadviga's mother. Why are you telling me this? So you won't forget it. Where you going? Forgive me. Don't say anything. Why do they treat him like that? What is it? Get away. Get away from here. Good Lord! Come! Come down! Come down! It's Ondris's. What have you been doing again? You're always up to something. A call-up paper. God Almighty. Show me. It's for the 21st. How long's it been here? Zelenak ate it. - We'll write an appeal. - Oh, darling... an appeal? Or I'll get Irmus's husband to send you to hospital. How can I pretend before a recruiting committee? You won't go. We'll tell them you're ill. I'll be sent before a court marshal. Don't leave me now. You said I should come today, Captain. What did I say? Everyone has his duties. I also have mine. As I'm an independent farmer we could perhaps refer to that. - Can't I take a leak in peace? - Sorry... I don't know what I can do for you. You've never been a soldier. You can't get out of reserve training. Unless you're missing an arm or leg. But I see you've got everything. - As a newly-wed should. - Yes, and perhaps you can understand. Understand I can. But orders are orders. Head up! Ondris will be home in a few weeks. You'll see. Oh, my God! Should I go and see that captain too? The times he came here to see you father! - The times I've cooked for him! - There's no point. He'd have fixed it by now if he'd wanted to. Where are you going? - Come and have lunch. - I'm not hungry. - I've fried some chicken. - I'm back. - Where have you been? - I had to buy a few things. I was waiting for lunch with you. - I wanted my last lunch with you. - Ondris! - I don't even know where you go! - I was buying pants, socks and tobacco for you to take with you. - I'm sorry. - All right, let me go. Say you're not angry. I'm not, but put me down. I'm tired. Did you have it taken for me? Keep it above your heart. Here... What can you say in Hungarian? What are you chewing? Baccy. You could make some kitchen cloths. My eyesight's too poor. It's lovely. Don't take it so wide. Mamovka! What is it? You remember my mother, don't you? Where did she live when they were married? In Nagy Street. And what happened to their things... when they died? Who can remember that now? Apovka gave me some tablecloths and bed-linen, but... They didn't have anything. Didn't my mother have a mandolin? A what? Mandolin... The furniture was sold. You got the proceeds. And more too, isn't that so? Apovka gave me so much... Tell me one thing. Was it he who wanted you to marry Ondris? No... by no means. When you were married, was my mother still alive? Yes, she was. Why, what did you think? You weren't born yet either. Why shouldn't she be alive? She died two years later. You want something? Bark, bark! Lick! Lick my hand! - Jadviga, dearest. - Dear Irmus. - Can I stay with you? - Come on in. I don't know what to do. - With your mother-in-law? - I think she's gone mad. I think she treated Apovka in the same way. Apovka certainly escaped from her. D'you know what he told me after my matriculation? In Florence... That he was in love with my mother. And with you too, dear. No, it was rather me in love with him. I wanted the same thing from him as my mother. And he? I don't know. Maybe he didn't know himself. He must have realized by the end. - He got scared... - When? Before or after? Oh, Irmus! Maybe he still loved my mother... Or he may have felt it was too late now with me... Can you wash my back? How are things with Franci? After the way he treated me in Stralsund... I don't want to see him again. He came at Easter. Yet no one invited him... - What did he want? - What do you think? - Are you having a bath? - Can you undo me? I'd happily dance with you... We don't dance with anyone. - Promise. - I promise. May I? No. Will you come home with me? No, I won't. Don't bark. Ondris! Oh, my God. Oh my God! Darling boy! Come on in! You're weary. I'll heat some water... - To wash in, and some food. - No, thank you, I'm not hungry. She's asleep. Please don't do that! Let me go! Jadviga! - Are you all right? - I'm fine. Nothing wrong? I just missed you very, very much. - Take it out of the bag... - What? The little parcel. So you're home, my boy? I was about to come to your office to say thank you. - What the devil? - For your help in getting me home... I wouldn't admit it even if I had got you home. But, I thought that... Don't talk out of turn. Only at the right moment. Clear? - Yes. - Were they pleased at home? Your wife got her due, eh? So, what's up in the village? I haven't had time to look around yet. That priest of yours, does he take care of you? You mean of his congregation? And the local Slovaks... - Yes, everything properly. - He keeps you together... I don't know. I was at the front. Next time go and mingle with them. You mean... Just as I say. You mean me? Why not? Not my aunt in Shanghai! Then you come to me and we'll talk. About what those great-big Slovaks are up to... Irmus isn't on very good terms with her husband. And if she wants me to... I might stay the night and come back in the morning. - What shall I bring you? - Yourself. Hurry home. You're sweet to see me off. Don't wait for it to leave. Irmus's husband has managed to get hold of that nice office for Franci Winkler... as his lawyers office... in the building where Irmus lives in the main street. They live in the same building? I tried to get a fountain pen for you... Impossible to get it. Things are so expensive! I bought you the coloured inks you like. I'll go and take a bath. Does the Foldes family live here? The doctor? Third floor, no. 2. They really live here? Ondris! You've come at a bad time, my friend. Were you coming to see me? No... I just... Your father dealt with Apovka's will, and... And now it's in my hands. Any problems? I was wondering about the inheritance. How come? My father sent you the certificate. He was still alive then. He sent it to all three of you. - All three of us. - Your mother, you and Jadviga. Jadviga? Of course. She inherited half the fortune. Jadviga? >From Apovka? How did he know we'd marry? He didn't leave it to his daughter-in-law. - But to his daughter. - His adopted daughter. That's right, pal. Come on, walk with me. Fancy your keeping that secret from me! What? That inheritance thing. That you inherit half the share. You or me, isn't it all the same? And anyway... It doesn't matter now. I'm going to have a baby. What? What's that? I'll have a son! Or a daughter... You'll have to love her too. I'll have a girl, a little girl. Put me down. Where is she? What were you going to do today? Nothing but adore you for this news. This annunciation! What's this nonsense about "not long ago"? And "a simple gathering of friends"? This is empty chat! I need to know who the host was? When, who was there and what was said? And what's this? "The manifestation of honest Slovak patriotism." Who's going to believe that, damn it? What homeland are they on about? Not ours, for sure. They're inciting to secession. "Motherland"! There's no country of Slovakia. - They mean symbolically. - Symbolically! They want to annex these areas to the Slovak "motherland"? I wouldn't think so. There's a war on. Madmen! And what about the deserters? The Red revolutionaries? The Jews posing as social democrats? There's your photographer friend. - He's one of them. - No, no way. No, no way. I advise you to open your eyes wide. Am I understood? We're not going home. We're not going home. We're not going home till we're drunk... Pretty girl. We're not going home. Miki, you drink too. We're meeting on Tuesday, at my place... The reverend asks you... - Or the captain... - to come without fail. I must make a note. Honoured company! My brethren! We know that one day the phoenix bird of the Slovak soul will rise up. My brothers in the mother nation, with which it is our greatest desire to unite, and whose suckling breast is our dearest longing. Sometimes I cannot fall asleep without imagining my arse pushed up against the mother nation. Priests, captains, you can all lick it. Many happy returns to all Andrews! Happy name day, Ondris! Nak panboyshivi... To your son, too. Grow strong, baby Marci. Wait! That's it, we must have a photo of the youngest Osztatni. - With his mother. - No, I don't want to. Keep still! I'd like to go to a spa. For the medicinal waters. Would you let me? - A spa? But why? - I've finished breast-feeding now... The doctor recommends it. To calm my nerves too. So I can be like I was before. Well, - if it does you good... - Dear person! - How long will it be? - Just a week. Show me! I didn't need to try them before. Come on, you're as slim as a girl. That's it! Right... - So... No? - No. Wait, I know! The patterned one. It's done me well too. Are you still ticklish? No... You didn't do that. How soon we forget... - You know what I thought? - What? You little goose! You didn't lose your virginity, sad to say... So cheeky! Why did you send me away from Stralsund that time? - You know very well. - I apologised a thousand times. Engagements aren't usually postponed by telegram! - It was a force majeure. - You were a force majeure. The things you said about me. I was told. I was joking. I hardly knew you then. Yet you proposed to me ten times a day. My God! So that's why you didn't marry me? You weren't that serious about it. - I've waited three years for this. - For what? To be able to make love to you, at last... in entirety. It's beautiful. You'll find someone to love one day. No, only if he comes home. You heard he'd been killed. You mourned him. You'll forget him... Never. You never think about men? She can only think of her fiancé�. Yet what she needs is someone to love her. It's your turn, Anci! - I've no one to call. - Yes, you have. - But he died at the front. - Try someone else. Who? I don't mind, if you don't. You can call him... my husband, Ondris. God Almighty. Enchant him for yourself. Don't worry, you have my permission. You aren't against it? - Like a glass? - No, thank you. Come. Are we going away... or are we not? Let's get going. There's just the evening train. We'd get there at night. I don't mind... I'm not in the mood now. - What's the matter? - I don't like it here. Or all this cigar smoke. - Where are you going? - To the other room. Won't you sleep with me? I've been looking forward to it. So have I. To sleep alone at last. Get a divorce. - Make a decision! - Go to sleep. Good night. Mama's home. Don't cry. - Where on earth have you been? - Don't torment me again. - Aren't you tormenting me? - Yes, I am. - It can't go on like this. - You're right. Chase me away. I just make everyone unhappy. Why do I keep hearing that I'm good and beautiful? Yet I know, even if I can't see you: You reve when I'm away. You tear at my clothes. You stifle my pillow. I swear I don't! Not even in my thoughts. And he keeps tormenting me... to decide on a divorce. Who are you talking about? You must get rid of me. I am damned. I can't even take care of my little boy. Drink, because it quenches sorrow as well. I've just seen my old pal - Franci Winkler! - You're drunk. I'm going to bed. Don't wake me when you come in. You know what I'd like? - I'd like her to sing to me. - Who? Who? The one who should put her arms round me and sing to me: "Beat me, beat me..." D'you understand, Miki? - Well, not exactly. - Damn it all! What I want is... I'd like her sing that lovely comfort aria to me. - She's not a singer. - Let her be one! Let her be one, and sing once: "Beat me, beat me, good Masetto." Right now! - Don't you care that we were seen? - No. - I haven't got time now. - I've got to talk to you. - My clients are waiting. - I don't care. Are you crazy? What's happened? - What's the matter? - Are you sick of me? What's this you write to me? What's this terrible letter? It's another woman, isn't it? Leave me alone. I never question you. Up till now I haven't cared... about your affairs with women... or your financial affairs... or your affairs of honour... I'm not interested in any of them. Only you. But I must know one thing. What this woman means to you. - I want to know. - Nothing. And what do I mean to you? What do I? Everything. Shall I tell you why I must know? Shall I tell you why? Why? Because I'm pregnant... and I want to bear your child. D'you want me to? D'you want me to? I do! Don't worry, we don't be a burden. I'll stay at home. And Ondris? He's got a bigger soul than we two put together. How about those magic tricks? How should I know? Don't drink here as well. Some sort of women's sorcery, Gregor. What kind of? How they get lovers? How do they? They cut a little hair... zo pitshki... Do they? From their cunts? And they bake it in a scone. And make us eat it. Make you! What are you doing? Gregor! What d'you know of my wife? Not a lot, but enough. What do you think of her? You ask too many questions. Why? A man must be strong. And resist evil or it'll consume him. Could you resist evil when it came in the form of a woman? Had I not been careful in the past, I'd be where that wretched Zelenak is now. - My mother wanted you to? - Let's leave that. You brood too much. You'll always be a peasant for them. Don't try to be a gentleman by not working. When I croak, who's going to run this place? You have a son. I should do penance. Flog myself... Nonsense! You should stay sober and get down to work! I'll be on duty till Wednesday morning. I get myself discharged, while you... It's war-time, there are more and more wounded. Well, then... I'll be back. Goodbye. - Franci. - Yes, darling. - You're going on the afternoon train, aren't you? - Yes. I'd say come and see me before you go, but I've got a lunch. I don't need lunch. These are dull, official people. Of course. Will Ondris meet the train? Sure to. Well then, take care. What's the matter? It's moved! Mother! Mother! I think we'll stay the night with Irmus after all. - Or with Franci. - Can't you leave that! If the train's late, we'll see the doctor late too. - There's nothing wrong with Misu. - Stop grousing. Bear. Be good! I must show Misu to the doctor. If he's ill, he shouldn't be dragged around. Come on, this'll be the one. Good day. It really is here. How did you manage it in this turmoil? Stop! In the name of the Council Republic! - What is this? - Communism. Let's go home. - I'm not. - Come on, Jadviga, I beg you. - D'you hear? - Go if you want, I'm catching the train. Hey, don't you even notice us? Put it on board. Till someone breaks it again. I said it was a drunken mob. Come on! These things always start with the Jews. Can't you give the Jewish bit a miss? The Entente's here now. - If we play our cards right... - Who's the "we"? The Slovaks living here. We should belong to the Slovaks' state after all. When we're 400 kilometres from Bratislava? When the Romanians are on our doorstep? It's crazy! Then we'll have our Slovak autonomy under Romanian rule. You idiots! Won't Hungary do for you? Not only do you want to masturbate, you need a sheep pen among the Romanians as well. Is nothing sacred for you? Neither nation, nor good taste? One can't expect anything better from a Jew. My dirty mouth, is not because of my race. If you smash my window, do so because you're mad at me, not because you can't stand the Jews. You're the one who has no respect for other races. For you Romanians belong in the sheep pen, Slovaks are stupid. You're not going to quarrel over dirty politics I hope. You dare to say which are clean and dirty aims? Do you see he's got a birthmark? Just where yours is. Aren't his legs crooked? What nonsense! Why would they be crooked? - Does Ondris like him? - What's that suppose to mean? Nothing... I just thought of my poor friend. He's not your friend any longer. - And I don't like you mentioning him with pity. - I'm not. Far from it... I respect him. It's good of him to care so much for you all. Why did you ask us to come if you're not interested? Because I missed you. Leave me alone! Leave me alone! My brothers in Jesus Christ! The edifice of the power suppressing nations, the Monarchy, is getting rickety. And from the dust and ashes of this war - the Phoenix bird... - Phoenix, d'you hear? ...of the people's soul will rise up. Thus our hearts' desire has been fulfilled. The Slovaks of the Hungarian Plain have found at last the protector of their patriotism and national welfare. In this solemn moment I declare our accession to Romania! - What has been fulfilled? - We'll be Romania now. Victory! We'll be Romania. Thank you, Mrs. Hulina. What's the idea? I didn't call Mrs. Hulina in from the farm to carry bath water for madam during working hours. So she can soak herself. In broad daylight. And I won't tolerate my maid telling me that mlada - ordered her to do this and that. - Mamovka, please stop. I've spoken to that other maid. She's stronger than Anci. Now that we have two children... If you don't mind, darling, let's send Anci away. I don't mind. What do you want? A gentleman... spoke to me... on the street... What gentleman? Well, him. The usual one. Franci! What did he say? That... he has to speak to the lady of the house. Is he here? He'll wait at the ballroom entrance if that's convenient. Don't you want to go? What if it can't wait... Can't wait! I'm always waiting. Besides, we're having supper. - Have you ever cooked for him? - Oh, come on. Of course, he spoils you, right? Let's drop this, shall we? I think I'll go to bed. What shall I wear? The grey or the one with jasmine flowers? The jasmine flowers. You're prettier in that. Who else incited against the Hungarians? Well, I'll tell you. The host of that day's meeting. - Who was the host that day? - I don't know. You've told me once already, damn it! Pal Rosza, the teacher. - But Pali didn't incite anyone. - Didn't he? Write: Rosza supported it. It says here that on February 4, 1919 you too were present at your friend the photographer's. Where the notary met the president of the Directorate. But Szvetlik was only there as notary to discuss the flour supply for the poor. And they agreed. Yes, on providing for the war orphans. Right, then, come on in. Write: In the course of questioning Osztatni it was proved that Szvetlik cooperated with the Communist Directorate in planning the embezzlement. What's that? Your witness is lying. This has to be proved at the trial too. I never accused you of that. Repeat your statement. Tell him straight. You'll be a witness at the trial. You can'tjust... You go out and wait there. You're going to sign this. I don't even remember... You don't remember? Who sent me those reports? I won't sign anything. You damn well will. Do you want to break your neck too? I know... That I've become a nobody. After my wife, in the eyes of my friends and now in the eyes of my wife's lover too. Ondris, please... Why? I was a coward and an idiot. I'm a spy, a police informer! I betrayed my friends. Don't accuse yourself. You were foolish at the trial, but Franci will do all he can. - You've gone back to him, true? - That's not the point. But it's true, isn't it? Franci! Oh, yes. He'll do all he can. But I'm a nobody. Nothing. That's what I've become. Because I've always been afraid. I had no interest in work, or land, or honour. Just the fear of - losing you. - Forgive me if that's my fault. I've always been terrified of losing you. But I've deserved it. My sins were plenty. It's as if you were my little boy now. Or my brother. Sorry but... isn't he here? D'you know where Franci is? - How should I? - Can I wait for him here? Dearest... - Am I disturbing you? - Well, I'm... So you're sending me away. Go back, and tell whoever's there that it's all clear. Are you crazy? Take him out of here. I've come... because Breeze is going to die tomorrow. He's going to the slaughter-house. I want to order photos from you. Please photograph my horse. - Before he dies. - Ondris, ...no. Take him out. It doesn't matter. I need a photo of my wife too... Though she wouldn't allow it. You know, when she's making up. She never lets me watch. Once I saw her, that's true. Once... Come on, take a photo. Stop that, Miki. Sit down. Stop what you're doing. I said no. I'm working. Have you heard anything? Is there a verdict yet? Is it true Pista got a suspended sentence? He can't be a notary any more. He was accused of embezzlement too. Unjustly. Did you talk about me? - That at the trial I... - Yes, we did. He won't talk to me. Nor will Pali Rosza. - Why not? - Pali's been banished to Slovakia. You heard right. The Slovak plotter should get out along with his priest. Within a month. How come you are so amazed? You signed the minutes, didn't you? Let me tell you... I'd rather you didn't. One day... we'll talk about it perhaps... And you should photograph this too. That the cliff is high, the water deep. But there's no high cliff nor deep water around here, I'm afraid. Miso! Miska! Are you afraid of witches? What are you doing, Marci? Out you go. Stay with her. I'll get the doctor. Here's Papa! So... here you are. Yes. - What news at the farm? - Nothing. Let's go, boys. Where did you get that hat from? Just a hat. It's Apovka's isn't it? You look like him in it. Off we go. There's Uncle Franci. To your health! Why aren't you drinking, Franci? Champagne. They're drinking champagne. Champagne aria. D'you know who Mozart is? D'you know who that child is? Do you know? Ondris! Ondris! Ondris! No... Not fighting. Don't you recognize me? Yet I was introduced to you. Right here. You at least should talk to me a bit. All I know is that I'm a monster. What do you know about me? Can you hear? Answer me! Talk to me just this once. I ask you for the last time. Your hand. Gently, gently. What happened? The doctor will be here soon. What happened to him? He has spasms. What kind of spasms? Gregor! Where does it hurt? Here? Am I at home? Yes, my darling. Yes, my darling. At home... on my pillow. I'm not going away. I'm staying here with you. Mama... Your hand! I'm afraid. Very afraid. Let's sleep. Ondrisko! My Ondrisko! I want to be alone with him. Our Father, who art in heaven... You had to suffer so much, my son! Uncle Gregor, could you post this letter on your way? I've finished now. Right. So when can we talk about what needs to be done? Never again. What d'you mean, never? I've had enough. I must give this to you. Goodbye. I, Andras Osztatni am starting this notebook on February 5, 1915, the day before my marriage. Hot and flushed with excitement, sleep won't come to my eyes. So I've taken this notebook out already, because I've decided to keep a diary from now on seeing I'll be a married man. At this moment midnight is chiming so I may write that today, February 6, 1915 I can at last lead Jadviga Maria Palkovits to the altar. I thank the Lord that I lived to see this day.
