It's late, Professor Phillips. You're working too much. I know but today's a special day. Maybe we're about to witness an incredible phenomenon. But you may go, thank you. I can lock up. No, Professor, I'm happy to stay. It shows that you're new here, but after a few months, you won't be saying that anymore. I've done it! I've done it… I've done it! You are a genius, Professor. A true genius. Oh, no… it's quite elementary. You see, my serum crystallizes on the skin cells by absorbing light radiation and re-emits them without deviation on the opposite side of the body. You are truly a magician. You're quite OK, right? You just had a good scare. You're sure it will work on humans too, right? Oh, certainly. There's no doubt. Goodbye, Professor. What do you think, Gorilla? A masterstroke, don't you think? Was the experiment successful? - Perfectly. And now, hurry up and place the explosives. OK, Boss. We must celebrate. I want an explosion that will rock all of London. Are you ready? Let's go. Whenever you want, Kid. You sure there won't be any traces? - Don't worry. And now… we're the only ones with the invisibility serum. Go! I bet a thousand. - I'm in. - Me too. This is it, boys. Starting tonight, there won't be a gang that can stand up to us. Careful, Boss, you're no guinea pig. I must test its effects. And if it doesn't work on humans, Boss? It will work. You can rest assured of that. What effect is it having? Nothing. I feel nothing. Boss, you're becoming transparent! Kid, are you there? - Sure, and I see your stupid faces! We can get all the money we want! - And without much effort. An invisible man doesn't need to break open safes. Here's my drawer. No counterfeits. - Thank you. Drawers 6 and 8. Everything is in order. Thank you. - Good night, gentlemen. Fisher, drawer number 6. Smith, will you be much longer with that? Don't interrupt or I'll mess up. Afterwards, check these too. - Sure. 647, 648… Hi. Don't be late. You'll call me? Yes, 253, 61, 62, 63… Bye. - 64… bye! This is done. Hi, Alika. Did everything go smooth? Of course. And you, Frida? The usual, dear: I left my little packet and took one of theirs. Maybe we can step up the pace of these substitutions. Mine is such an imbecile, I could change bank notes with newspaper and he wouldn't even notice. And you? - All one needs is some cleavage, a little flattery and the game is won. I'd love to see the faces of the managers when they discover the safes are filled with counterfeit notes. By the way, do we still have many pounds notes to get rid of? No, just a few weeks worth. The Liverpool branch had to be interrupted before the fixed quota. We need to pass off a million more. Any other news? I forgot: There's a box for you. Hello. - Hi, Melina. There it is. - Finally. What's inside? Any presents? - Something very interesting. Now you'll see. It looks just like soap. What are they? - Good. As soon we're done with the pounds, we'll make a nice trip to America and start with dollars. These are the printing plates. Let me see! - A brilliant plan, Alika. Perfect, right? Look! What the…? A brilliant plan indeed! But it only takes a fool like you to screw it all up! What are these? Did you change sides to bring us false money? No, Alika! I beg you… If we spend only one of these, and we'll all wind up in jail! I couldn't change them! They almost caught me! Take her downstairs and give her a lesson as a warning. Come on, move it! Remember I'll tolerate no mistakes from you! No, let me go! - Is that understood? Well, I'm done. You have much longer, Smith? No, I'm almost done too. - Bravo. See you tomorrow. Bye, see you tomorrow. Instead of wasting time counting it, put it right away in this bag along with everything in the safe! Have you never seen an invisible man? What's the matter? Scared? Move it! Or I'll blow your head off like a ripe pumpkin. Come on, hurry. In the sack. Hurry up! Even what's in the drawer. Uh… yes… Tie it well. Give it here! You damn fool! No! Mr Smith! Mr Smith, what happened? The gun… the gun was moving by itself. It made me put the money in a bag and then went out the window. Who? - The bag! But who took the money? You saw him, right? No, I didn't see him. It threatened me with a gun and also hit me here on the mouth. But I didn't see anyone. What do you mean? An invisible man! Got it? The money is indeed missing, but if you want us to believe it was robbed by a ghost, well, that's hard to swallow. And maybe a friend of yours was passing under the window, who took the sack of money and fled. Right. Yes, yes, a friend of the ghost. No, a friend of the cashier. Isn't that correct, Mr Smith? - You don't believe… We don't believe, we verify. I know it's hard to swallow, like he says, and yet I was robbed by an invisible man. I've never heard a dumber excuse. So, are you going to come with us the easy way or the hard way? Well? Let's go. What happened? Who fired? Smith, don't be a fool! Stop! Stop! Come back! - It was an invisible man, I swear! He's crazy! Where did he go? - He disappeared! Impossible! Wonderful! And that's just the first hit. Kid, I've drawn you a map of the Bank of London. When are we going? Whenever we want. With our system, now stealing has become so easy, it isn't fun anymore. Flashman! - Flashman! Get the money out! Hurry! - Get him! It's not just you, my friends, who have their little tricks! He's invulnerable! Run, Kid! Wait, Gorilla, hold him here as long as you can. I'll fix him. Invisible or not, you're going to feel this! A clever plan and I fell for it. Damn you, you'll cost me a helicopter, but you'll be gone forever! You've met your match this time, eh? Did he fall for it? You killed him? He exploded with the helicopter. Welcome back, Milord. Did you have a good day? - Not bad, Jeeves. Only that the Thames water is a little cold this season. Cold indeed, Milord. Oh, if I may say so, Milord, today you had some good shots. Your bulletproof suit needs to go to the dry-cleaners. Two machine gun shots and a few pistol shots: the usual, Jeeves. I understand. Where shall I serve tea, Milord? In the red room, thank you, Jeeves. - Right away, Milord. Today I thought about it and and I see you have a screw loose. Hi, brother! I wish you only had that, sister! - What did you do today? A 100 meter dive into the Thames. A world breaking record. Well done, Alexei! Or shall I call you Flashman, the masked hero? Why not? Even if I'm dressed like a comic book hero, I do it to help the police without being known. But you should stop going about with painted cheeks, mini-skirts and all that. Why? Everything is in its place and I show what is needed. Ira, don't be impudent! You put on science fiction stuff but you're a small-minded conservative! Dear, when someone has the money I have, he must also invent something to find interest in life. Some collect Chinese prints or butterflies but I collect criminals. Come, let's go, revolutionary. Did you look in the newspapers? - Yes, I always get the boring stuff. There: An explosion at the London Academy of Sciences. There we go. - And how did it happen? An accident that killed Professor Phillips. I must've read about it. - A strange accident. May I ask you, Milord, which tea you prefer today? Indian, Chinese, Malaysian, Pakistani? Malaysian, Jeeves, the first harvest of 62. Phillips was studying invisibility. They said he was mad. But apparently, he managed to find his serum. Yes but… - That's why that gang took him out. Just think, Scotland Yard is dealing with invisible criminals. A danger to all England. Here is finally an exciting case to solve. Sorry, little brother, I don't understand anything. I thought that nowadays, you were playing the fake cashier in our bank. Yes, at the Irish bank. I got hired by the name of John Smith to find out why there were counterfeit pounds, despite the checks of the cashiers. Is it clear now? - Not much. Did you find out? A counterfeiter. A gorgeous brunette. Now I understand why you found this case so important. But suddenly a much more interesting thing happened: An invisible man robbed my bank. Naturally, nobody would believe it and the poor cashier Smith was stuck in the middle. Then it's better John Smith disappears forever. Maybe not. I have an idea. Come. You were the last person to see Smith before the hit. And we also know you had a soft spot for the cashier. Come on, confess! Let's not waste anymore time. Look, I said I don't know anything and that I never saw him again. It's true I had a soft spot for him but it was a just a fleeting fancy. A fancy that lasted until it was time to nab the loot that Smith threw from the bank window, right? No, not true. Nobody threw anything to me. I didn't see anything. I know nothing! - They all say that! But a man disappeared here and I say it's impossible, impossible, that one could jump from the 4th floor without a corpse being found! Don't you think so? You're hiding him! Eh? You're in love and hiding him, eh? The corpse? You would smell it, Inspector. Search the whole house from top to bottom! Right away, Inspector! - Look, I was just joking! Someone's hiding in this house! When Baxter follows a clue, he knows how to handle it! Inspector, we didn't find anyone. - Nobody's here. All right. Let's go. But you keep yourself available! Sure, Inspector always at your disposal. Come! Let's not waste time. - But…! No, it's alright, dear. I'm innocent and it's better I turn myself in. How the hell…! - I knew he was there! When Baxter follows a clue, there's no escape for the criminals! "Counterfeiter caught with his gang. All the stolen goods recovered in the hands of the cashier." It's impossible! It's a trick of those damn cops! The helicopter blew up and the money burned with that damn Flashman! They couldn't have retrieved it from that cashier. That cashier… Damn it, the story is absurd. Boss, I say we better look to the bottom of this business. Maybe that Flashman is indestructible. Maybe he's a demon. - Why do you say "is"? He was! We all hope so. But why take risks? There's a man in prison who had money he could not have. Let's go hear what he has to say. In jail? I'll go, Boss, if you give me some of that serum. We have little of it and don't know how to make more. But you are right. We must go and see. But you won't go. I'll go. Hello… Don't you feel well, Captain? I don't know, I felt like a weight here on my stomach pushing me back hard. Ah, you ate too much, Captain. Yes, maybe I did. But I didn't even eat yet. I don't get it… No…! No, stop! I'm going insane… I'm going insane. No, stop! I'm crazy… I must be crazy! - No, you're not crazy! You're dead if you don't tell all! Speak or I'll strangle you! Who is Alika and where'd she get that money? I already told them! Nobody believed me! In the bank, the gun… This I know. Why did you run away? I didn't run away! I realized that no one would ever believe me. I had a moment of confusion, the window was open and I jumped out. Yeah, and then you glided like a bird, eh? I want the truth! - It is the truth! I threw myself down… to die and then I passed out. - And then? When I woke up, I was in Alika's flat and I could hear the inspector torturing her with his questions. So, to make him stop, I appeared of my own accord. And the money? - I don't know… it was there… right next to me in a bag… Yes, exactly the same bag I put it in! I'm suffocating, no… - Talk or I'll kill you! And be careful, imbecile! Now explain to me, how could that money be there if I took it? I don't know… I don't understand anything. If I could talk to Alika in the other cell… She certainly can explain it all. Maybe… Maybe I'm crazy! Crazy! Crazy! Crazy… Crazy, crazy… Wake up, baby, beddy-bye is over! And now be a good girl. Tell me all that you know of the money stolen from a bank! How did you get it and why did you use that cashier? What is this? A new way to question prisoners? What the hell is going on here? Damn, an invisible man! How do you do it? I'm naked so keep your hands to yourself, doll. Now sing or I'll tear your skin to shreds! I know nothing about that money. That damn cashier came out of nowhere just when Baxter was asking me his stupid questions. You want to kill me? It's the truth! This story will work on idiots like Baxter but not me! You're invisible, but you must look like a fool to waste your time so, when you could be master of half the world. That's my business. - Can you smoke? I can do anything I want, baby. Anything! Got it? Are you gonna tell me how you got that money or must I kill you? I just printed my own money. And business was good until that nosy cashier was put in there. If there's anybody who should be killed, it's him! He jumps from the 4th floor, shows up in my print works and screws everything up. Isn't that a bit much for a humble bank teller? That bastard told me that you saved him. And you believed that? He's not a man who needs to be saved. We need to be saved from him! Look, if you're lying, I'll make you pay, dear. I really want to know which of you two is fooling me. Come! Oh, what's this? Another invisible man's cell? Damn, he's gone. - Who? That dirty cashier. I said he knows how to do too many things to be a cashier. Look here! "I'll have him back soon. Flashman." Flashman? Him again? I think we have a common enemy. Get me out of here, whoever you are. Together, we'll be stronger. We'll get along perfectly. OK, doll. Agreed. Follow me, I'll let you out. Hey, where are you going? The young lady is coming with me. Today is the day of her release. There you go, doll. Now I'll bring you to place where we can rest easy. Why, it's wonderful! The two of us together will be able to do anything, anything! That's him: Ahmed Ben Khan, the richest man in the world. A hit that will make us rich for life. You know him well? I've already told you, I had my eye on his money. That fool fell in love with me and wanted me in his harem. But I left him high and dry. It won't be hard to make him think I've changed my mind. And when I'm alone with him, the invisible Kid will make him do what we want. I've always dreamed of being a maharaja: A hundred wives, splendid palaces, tons of diamonds, gold, gems. I'll weigh as much as Aga Khan, but only after I've eaten a lot. Then you'll go? You're wanted though. Oh, don't worry, I'll be fine. I'll travel nude with a little serum in my blood. Nude? I like that idea! Now, let's go. Come, Alika. Good night, friends. Can I get "Life"? Thank you. Are you sure it was in this magazine? Very. Look, there must be something about the maharaja. And something about Beirut. Ah, here: "The richest man in the world." Maharaja Ahmed Ben Khan will be in Beirut in a few days with his 25 wives to meet his only daughter Nevenka returning from a Swiss school." Nevenka… - What do you want to do? First home and then Scotland Yard. We must prevent those criminals, Kid and Alika from leaving London and only Baxter can do it. - Do you go as Lord Burman? Lord Burman at the police to report criminals? No. Lord Burman doesn't know such scum. But Flashman does. I'll try to get that fool to move. I'll go see him at Scotland Yard. Hello? Eh? Who's talking? This is Inspector Baxter. A masked man? A masked man here at Scotland Yard? And why not a Martian with his nice flying saucer parked in the garden? Do you know what you are? You're a bunch of imbe… Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? We got cut off! A masked man! - Flashman to friends. But… - No! Don't be afraid, Inspector Baxter. I'm here to help you. I bring you proof that a man can make himself invisible. An old acquaintance of yours: the Kid. You must nab him right away, he's hatching a plot against… Be still! Go away… actually, no! You're under arrest! Don't yell. Listen well. - OK… The Kid killed a scientist who was researching invisibility. Hands up! Get up, agents! Hurry! Damn blockhead! Inspector Baxter! Inspector, what happened? Who was shooting? Stop! He's dead. - They killed him. Idiots… Idiots! Catch him! Stop wasting time! The Masked Man! It's locked! Break down the door! Break it down! Don't waste time! Knock down the door! Knock it down! Hurry! Inspector, he escaped. Inspector, they escaped! - Who? The two we arrested yesterday: Smith and Alika. From prison? - And with an invisible man's help. Will you stop with this invisible man stuff? Got it? Search the whole city! Use dogs! Start a manhunt! We must find them! Damn it! Why don't you look where you're going? Attention! Stay close to me. - OK, Kid. Thank you. Boarding pass, please. They left for Beirut. - I see you're into masks too. Listen, my reactionary brother, there's Baxter. He or his men must have wind of something. Now the kid has left, we must bring that jackass inspector with us. If we can get him to run into Alika and the rest, he'll arrest them. Shall I whistle to him? - No. But try to get noticed. - Leave it to me. Grab my dress. You should be ashamed! He's coming. Here we go, it's John Smith. Hey! I'm placing you under arrest. May I help you, young man? - Yes. Wait, I am… hold this, please. I'm Baxter, Chief Inspector of Scotland Yard. Sorry, but you must follow me for a check. A check? Did you hear that, dear? I need to be checked? We're looking for a certain John Smith, an escapee from prison, where he was serving for bank robbery. You bear a striking resemblance to him. Bank robbery? Maybe in my bank. I am Lord Burman, the major shareholder in England's largest bank. However I want to reassure you. Where is a telephone? Here. Who do you want to call? The Royal Palace. Come, dear. Who? - I said the Royal Palace, why is that so strange? Excuse me. Come. Is this Buckingham Palace? - Extension no 1 for Lord Burman. Give me extension no 1 for Lord Burman. Please wait, I'll pass it to Lord Burman. It's Alexei. An unfortunate misunderstanding, Liz. Here is a certain…? - Baxter. A certain Baxter, from Scotland Yard, who's fouled up. He wants to arrest me in place of another. Yes, dear. I'll pass him to you. Say hello to Philip. Who's this? Yes, your Majesty. As you wish. No, no, your Majesty, it was a terrible mistake. Of course, your Majesty. I shall go to hell, your Majesty. Never again, your Majesty! I swear it, your Majesty. I swear. Never again, your Majesty. You must accept my apologies, Lord Burman. Of course, don't take it too hard, Inspector. There are 3 billion little men on Earth and it could happen to mistake one for another. But now that we're acquainted, will you accompany me to my plane? Yes. - Come, dear. Come up, I'll offer you a friendly glass. Thank you. Excuse me. But I don't know if I can… - Please. Thank you. Gentlemen. Make yourself comfortable. I'd like to offer you… a specialty from Easter Island. Perhaps the oldest liqueur in the world. Please, taste it. - Thank you. You know it, I imagine. - Who? Easter Island, you know it? - No, no. Oh, well, it doesn't matter. I'm sure you'd like another small glass, Inspector. You see, traveling is my passion. As soon as I get time free, I like to visit your little world. The Middle East, for example, has an ideal climate in this season. Do you like this drink? Good. What a strange feeling! It feels like we're flying. But we are flying, Inspector. We'll be in Beirut in two hours and a half. No! But I… I can't, I have to… Poor beast, he never saw it coming. But he's not a bad guy when all is said and done. Hey! Hey, buddy, wake up! Wake up, I said! I can't, Milord… I can't… Come on, wake up! - Who are you? Commissioner Legrand, of the Lebanese police. But where am I? - What a question! In Beirut. In Beirut? Beirut? Beirut, Beirut… Where is Lord Burman? I must return to London right away! Sure. ID? - Who? Me? ID… Here it is. ID! Inspector Baxter of Scotland Yard! A mediocre imitation. How did you get it? With a 20 year career, young man! Will you give it back? Maybe, later. Meanwhile, let's leave here. This is one of the rooms reserved for the Maharaja Ahmed Ben Khan. Move it. Let's go. Get going! Once I've spoken to Scotland Yard, I'll show you! This way. - I know! You wait here. Maharaja Ahmed Ben Khan, my modest hotel is at your disposal. Two floors will suffice. - Very well, your Highness. Let's go, dear. The Maharaja. But she is… Alika! Don't get smart. Hands off! She's a counterfeiter and I must arrest her! I'll make those arrests. For now I'm arresting you. Come. But this is tyranny! An outrage! I'll cause a scandal! Let me go! Let me go I said! You see, my dear, I like to enjoy life and know how to reward those who help me. Well, if I don't succeed, there are 100 wives to console you. You westerners are all the same. Even my little Nevenka can't stand my wives. Nevenka? - My only daughter. I had her from a European during one of my stays in France. She was an exceptional woman but she couldn't adapt to polygamy. Don't you worry, I have a different temperament. And your wives don't scare me. Come closer, dear. You may go. Good night. - Good night, Your Highness. Don't be afraid, despite my methods and costume, I'm a friend. Promise me not to yell and listen to me. I'm listening but you better be convincing, for your own good. You're Nevenka, the Maharaja's daughter? Yes, and I'll have you whipped! - Listen. The woman who came with your father is an assassin. The Maharaja's in danger, the guards won't let anyone pass. Only you can warn him. - My father won't be disturbed now. And she's alone with him with guards at the door. But she has an accomplice. I can't explain right now. There's no time to waste. Go to your father right now! Darling, couldn't somebody come in? I don't want to be disturbed for any reason. Go. Done. Now no one will dare enter. Are you really sure? To disobey me would mean losing one's head. Good, Ahmed. But this time… you'll be the one to lose your head, if you don't do as I say! - Help! You love life too much to think of disobeying, right? Right? Yes, that's right… - Go, Alika. Let me in. - You can't by order of the Maharaja. The Maharaja's in danger. - Sorry, Your Highness. "All that I have to the New Life Company." And now sign. No. - Sign! My heart! What have you done? Try to revive him. He's dead. - No… Damn it! His heart couldn't handle it. Now we're in trouble. No, I have an idea. Maybe we can still do it. Let's go on with our plan. Make yourself invisible. The seal in the ring is as good as a signature. Let me in, that woman's a killer! - It's impossible. Let me in! Are you ready, Kid? - Yes. I'll keep the body upright It'll look alive. Help! The Maharaja wants to commit suicide! Help! The Maharaja wants to commit suicide! Papa! - Be quick! No, Papa! Don't do it! No, Papa! No! Quick call a doctor, the police! That woman! Stop that woman! Legrand, I'll have you fired! I'll raise a scandal! I'll cause an international incident! Calm down, you're not our prisoner, but our welcome guest awaiting investigation. Guest! And my tie? My belt? And my shoelaces? Huh? A small caution, that's all. - Oh, really? So you are indeed Inspector Baxter of Scotland Yard. At least it seems. - Open your cage, Legrand! Sir, the Maharaja is dead, Ahmed Ben Khan. They want you on the phone. - Excuse me, I'm busy. Hello, Inspector Legrand? Tie, belt and shoelaces. - Yes. Move it! - It happened at the Phoenix Hotel… Suicide? I'll be right there. I must go. - Me too. The lady I'm looking for was with him. Notwithstanding your kind help I still might be able to find her. He shot himself in the temple. We saw it. It was awful. Her Highness too. - It's true. Where is the lady that was with him, Alika, a tall brunette? You were looking for her, right? - Yes, how did you know? A man told me. The one who said who my father was in danger. That he wanted to kill himself? No, that they wanted to kill him. Her Highness is in no state to withstand an interrogation. She was there at the suicide. Yes, I saw it! I saw it! But they must have done something. My father would've never killed himself of his own will. He loved life too much. - Of course, Miss. He left almost everything to a charity. There's something fishy about this suicide. His daughter and servants saw him sign that and then shoot himself. What's fishy about that? We Orientals have more imagination than you English. We don't stop at appearances. Remove the body and arrange for the autopsy. For the rest, don't touch anything until forensics arrive. Seal the doors and windows and don't let anyone in. What an imagination! What's needed is method and a nose. But these people arrest an inspector just because of a passport! I'd really like an ice cream. Here, suck on this and go beddy-bye. You always treat me like I were a child. Hey! This is something out of James Bond! My lollies are unique. Remember, use them to signal danger. See you later. Bye. The same prints as the Kid. Hands up, Superman. With that child's toy? - A toy, you say? I'm a gentleman. A lady's wishes are orders. No funny stuff. Let's see who you are! Ah, congratulations, I would've never believed it. And so you're John Smith, cashier and who knows who else. Flashman's true face is known only to friends or to corpses. Did you say friends or corpses? I'd prefer the former, wouldn't you? What's this? Another proposal? After all, I've always liked you. The two of us together could share the earth's riches. And what do you plan to do with the Kid? Either friends or corpses, and the Kid is too stupid to be a friend. And are you going to keep that gun pointing at me? You killed the Maharaja! Did you hear that? - I'm not deaf. What do we do? Break the seals? Open up! Open up the door! Hey, you inside, open up! Open the door! Open up! Open up the door! The balcony, quick! They always find a way. Damn it! But where are we? Still in this world. Don't be afraid, I'll take you to safety. But who are you? What a question! I am Ira and he's Flashman. Does it ring a bell? - No. You just need to know that I'm on your side. Do you remember the name of the charity to whom your father left everything? Yes, New Life. And do you know the address? It was… it was Amchit, I think. But why do you ask? - Now let's hurry. There'll be time for explanations. There they are! That's their car! Stay high! If they see us, our plan is ruined! They're approaching Baalbek! I see the ruins! There's a secret passage in the ruins! What shall we do? Land? - No, wait! You really go around London like this? Of course! I assure you the men do stare. It takes a lot to turn an Englishman's head. Come, the tea's getting cold. I'm afraid… it will get even colder. Shall I add two cups? - You won't feel like joking soon. Write! - What? A statement in which you write that you are tired of living. Tie her up. I want to make her talk. It'd be better if you sign at once. I detest the smell of burnt flesh. And who are you? Flashman's girlfriend? He has bad taste, I see. Maybe, but if you touch me, he'll kill you! Want to be a heroine? Let's see how long you last. Until I see you drop dead! I hope it's soon! No, leave her alone! I'll write whatever you want. No! - Shut up! Hurry up, then. Hurry! Write! "I can't live without my father" and sign it! Later, we'll prepare a nice surprise for that masked busybody. Did you sign? Good. Don't mar her! It must look like suicide. I'll leave it to you. When Flashman opens the door, the connection will switch off… and we'll get him out of the way forever this time. Be quick, there's a train at 7. We'll be in time to throw her under. With this, it'll take just a teaspoon to make him jump out of his famous suit. Here I am, I'll open it. A visit! The serum. That's for you! Keep yourself cool, Flashman! Get up! Come on, idiot! He played you like a rookie! Damn it! That imbecile shorted out the cooler. The serums will deteriorate. Open that door, but slowly! Judging by the charge, he's probably dead. But you never know. I said open it! But he's gone! He's disappeared! Watch the door! Damn you, you injected yourself with the serum! But you won't escape! He's here! I got him! I got him! Where are you, damn it? Nevenka is gone and my men found everything ransacked in the Maharaja's apartment. Someone came in through a window and took fingerprints that were on the gun with which he committed suicide. The strange thing is there were two kinds of prints on that gun. What's strange is that you arrested me letting the counterfeiter escape who I was cleverly tracking! Cleverly asleep at the Phoenix Hotel. Give me a break, Inspector. A stupid joke by Lord Burman who… What's the matter, Inspector? Not feeling well? No… What are you doing? You're too nervous. Don't be that way, Inspector, I've already said I was sorry. I'm being led by the nose! Oh, no, Inspector! - What do you mean? I'm being led by the nose! So you really are trying to be funny then? So, Baxter, what do you say now? Does this invisible man exist or not? But… but… it's Flashman! Is that your friend, Inspector? Are you convinced now that poor John Smith was telling the truth? So it was you who broke into the bank! No, I just wanted to prove that it was possible to be invisible with a serum discovered by the late Professor Phillips. This is the serum and this is the antidote. The Maharaja Ben Khan was killed and then the invisible killer staged a scene. He was dead when his daughter and others saw him shoot himself. And Nevenka, the daughter, where is she now? Safe. If you send your men to the New Life Office, you'll find your killers. Convinced now, Inspector? If you had let me talk, I would've explained it in London. Here are the vials. I'm going to get Nevenka and bring her here. No, wait a moment, wait! - Have him arrested! I can't order my men to go after an invisible man dressed like Superman. I would lose my job. Don't you dare touch them! It is the property of her British Majesty! I confiscate them in my government's name! Don't even think about it! You let go! Let go! Imbecile! Imbecile! Watch your words, I have the English government… Cut the crap and remember over there is a cell waiting for you! Hello? Prepare 2 cars with 6 men! Yes! Ira? What happened? - Nevenka…! Those two took her away. They want to throw her under a train. This evening at 7. We must save her. Will we do it? - I hope so. We've 3 minutes. This way she won't wake up. Take this. Place the will. - Yes, but let's hurry. Come on, let's hide behind those bushes. I want to be sure everything goes well. Hurry! Notify the police to follow the train and then try to join me. Alright. Now is… the time to dissolve our company. But… Alika… - No wasting time with chit-chat! Quick, give me the vials. Hurry up, fool! And yet you used to like me. How sentimental. Give it here… Damn it, the keys! Nevenka, are you hurt? - No… Don't worry, it's all over. The police will arrive shortly. This time you will pay, Alika! I don't know. They went towards the port. And the girl? Where did she go? Someone came by dressed like a madman and took her away. Can I leave now? - Shall we let them leave? I don't know. Shall we? - Can I leave now? Yes, of course. You, hurry up! To the port! To the port! To the port! Let's hurry! This way, Inspector. - Yes, I'm coming with you! There's smoke over there. Step on it! This time they won't get away. The Kid! Damn you! Search everywhere! Hurry! We must find something. Yes, Sir. - Let's go! Move it! Nothing… Nothing here either. Let's go. - The smoke came from here. Inspector! There's a hole over here. - Cover it up. You got lucky once again, eh, little brother? Finally we can go back to London. Yes, and very quickly too. Jeeves waits with dinner and I don't want to be late. He'll be offended. Are you taking me too? I'd love to know London. Of course, Jeeves can add a plate. Can we go? Let's go get Baxter first. You don't want to leave him here? - Then let's go! Holes! Nothing but holes. Useless, very empty holes! Yet there must be something else. They were all here! They couldn't all turn invisible! This is the first time ever I don't understand something. It's not clear. Don't overlook any thing! Keep looking! Search everywhere! See: There for example was a car. We can follow the tracks. One must rely on chance, intuition. Sometimes a detail will grab hold of you. No! Let go of me! No! Help! No! Let go of me! Help! No! Let go of me! I don't know how to fly! No! - Don't worry, Inspector! We're bringing you home. - No! Not all the way to London! No! No!
