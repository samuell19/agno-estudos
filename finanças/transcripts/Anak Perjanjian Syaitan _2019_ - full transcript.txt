Haaa okay, please excuse me then. Linda!! Honey? What's wrong? Huh? Nothing...nothing… Honey, I'm sorry if my decision makes you uncomfortable. I think it's the best for us. I'm okay. It's just that, surely your mother think it was me that incite you to move far from her. Honey, let me settle that with her. What's more important now, is that you're happy, not stress with her. This is our life! We will manage it ourselves. When are you going to report at the school? Tomorrow. Sayang? Sayang? That's not funny. Why did you startle me like this?! Hey, sorry...

Okay, you take care. I go first. Peace be upon you. And peace be upon you. Peace be upon you. And peace be upon you. Teacher Zaidy? Pak Leman! Our village headman. It's been awhile when you last came back. And out of the blue, I heard the news you're back here to teach. What got into you? Coming back here? It's a big opportunity there in Kuala Lumpur. Just a turning wind Pak Leman. After all, it's my father's wish for me to serve devotely to the young generations in this village. All praise to Allah. There goes the school bell. You're going to teach, right? I'm going back now. If there's anything, let me know. Sure Pak Leman. Or you can come straight to my house. With Allah's willing. Peace be upon you. -And peace be upon you. Careful. Okay Teacher! I hope you can give your best service here. With Allah's willing Teacher, I'll do my best. Come Stand up! Peace be upon you and good morning teacher! Peace be upon you and good morning teacher! And peace be upon you, good mornig , please sit down. Thank you teacher. Okay students. Today, I would like to introduce Teacher Zaidy. your new class teacher. Please give your full cooperation to him, understand? -Understand teacher! Okay then. Thank you. -Teacher, please excuse me. Pak Man. Yes madam. Drink this first. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Pak Man! Yes? How long have you look after this house? Since Zaidy's late grandmother still around. So you do know this house's history then? Let me continue my work, okay? Thank you for the drink. Peace be upon you. It's still working. Why did you made that decision without discussing it with me first? Would you agree if I've told you? Surely this is about Linda, right? Of course not, Ma…I wanted to fulfill late father's wish. and that is to help and serve the youngsters at our hometown. Where did you stay, over there? At late grandmother's house. Grandmother's house. Grandmother's house? Have you done thinking? Zaidy, you do know the history of that house right? Don't you? Ma, it was an old story. Even father have also said that all those things are nonsense. After all, that house were given to me. Let me stay there, to feel the village atmosphere for a change. Instead of turning wind, you should find a new wife. It's been 4 years now and there's no indication of baby coming. Better find yourself a new wife! Ma…I've talked about this before. and... Pak Man!!! Pak Man, help me!! Pak Man help me, Pak Man!! Madam? What's wrong? Pak Man!!! Pak Man help!! Why? Madam? That's nice. Teacher Zaidy, feeling tired It has been a long holiday, resting…so the body becomes pampered. It's okay to get a pampered body…but not a pampered lady teacher! After all, a villager's hope and a spoiled child is back in the village to serve the community. Hey if i want that, I can get it when we were back in KL simply just by snapping my fingers. With snapping fingers yeah? You're itchy aren't you Teacher Zaidy? Don't sulk, I'm just kidding. You do know that I love you, right? I'm doing all this for you, trust me. No, it's not about that. This house... You never tell me before about your late grandmother? And what actually happened here? I will tell you when the right time comes. Sayang! Sayang hurry here…sayang. Sayang hurry up!! Sayang! Sayang! Sayang! Sayang! -Honey? Honey? What's wrong? What? Whats wrong? Eh, what is it? There's nothing here. There was something there sayang! It was here just now! At first I don't believe in all those things Pak Leman. but when it happened to my wife, happened to me…I saw it…I saw it, Pak Leman. Pak Leman, do you think it has got to do with my late grandmother's 'saka'? That house were abandoned for 5 years. Surely, there's other creatures staying there. Moreover, your late grandmother was a "Saka" practitioner. When she past away, I thought the 'thing' were thrown away. Why it came back? It must have come back to claim some promises. You still remember the story how your late grandmother died, right? Abang! Mother is keeping the 'thing,' right? That is why it's difficult for her to die. Don't you talk that way, she's my mother. For now, I'm doing my best for her, so that she can go easily. I'm scared Abang. Abang, let's go back to our house in KL. Let's not come back here. I'm so scared ! Sir, can we? Zaidy! Zaidy! Sorry Pak Leman. We can't see these 'things' with our bare eyes. It's difficult to explain what've happened. If we're obsess about it, it can jeopardize our faith…right? That day when you move into the house... didn't you do Bacaan Doa Selamat? You must do the Bacaan Doa Selamat. Who is that, Pak Leman? Huh...that's the person you need to stay away from. Cheater, he lied to all the villagers. Ustaz indeed... ...can heal people... ...in truth he's only using 'it'! That's why he's staying far from this village...boycotted by the villagers. What happened Pak Leman? (That child belongs to me!) Madam! Zaidy, this is Pak Man..your wife fell and fainted...come home now! Okay Puan. Please take a rest. I need to talk to your husband. Please. Mr. Zaidy, don't worry. Your wife is okay. She fainted because she fells down. Her head got hit but it's just a small cut. All praise to Allah. I'll give you painkiller and ointment to apply, okay? Thank you Doctor. One more thing, the baby, please be more extra careful. If she fells down again, chances for her to be miscarriage is high! My wife is pregnant ? Yes, you didn't know? I think it's 2 months old. All praise to Allah. Ma, have a drink. I've some important matter to discuss. What is it? I want you to allow Zaidy remarry. Why are you talking about? Linda… I've waited for 4 years but still no results. That is why I want you to allow Zaidy remarry. Zaidy is my only child. My descent depends on him. You do understand, right? You keep on blaming me. If it's your son's problem, how is it then? No…Zaidy is okay, he's fertile…he went for the medical examination. I'm okay too. Doctor said I'm fertile too. If you're okay, then where's the baby? Until today, there's nothing right? Just permit Zaidy to remarry! After all, I'm not asking for Zaidy to divorce you Linda. Ma.. you and I are both women... if you can't understand how I feel then I don’t have to respect you as a woman. Hey! When we're back home, please don't do any work…just rest, okay? I'll ask Pak Man to find us a maid. Have you told Mama? Yes, I have told her. She's really happy. She's coming over this weekend. Okay? Sayang! Hi Honey, look what I bought for you? Kerabu Mangga, favourite for pregnant moms. That looks yummy... …Sayang, you didn't forget my roasted corn? Wow…just because you're 5 months pregnant, you crave all sorts ya? Ehh, it's our child that's craving. Okay, I will stop and buy the roasted corn. Just hang on for awhile. I will be home shortly. Sayang! Sayang, who is that behind you? There is no one, honey. I'm all alone. There nothing... Sayang! Sayang! Help me please Sayang…O Allah!! Help me please... please help Sayang! O Allah!! Honey, you okay? What's wrong? I need to go to toilet. Sayang! Sayang! Sayang! Honey, whats wrong? Doctor, whats' wrong? Is there anything not right? Let me be honest with you. This is something unsual for a 5 months old pregnancy, okay? But... My child is okay, right? I find it unusual. From my check-ups, the baby's condition is normal, heartbeat normal, size of the baby is normal too. Only that, I'm not sure why her belly is bigger than usual condition. Doctor, what should I do? Should I refer my wife to the specialist? I'll make few calls and I'm going to send my medical findings to the specialists. I'll get some answers and when I do, I'll inform you and Puan Linda. Thank you , Doctor. Hello Honey, are you okay? Yes sayang, I'm okay. I'll be at home. Please don't worry. You don't have to call me all the time. Focus on teaching, alright? -Alright Honey. Please take care. If there's anything, please call me straight or call Pak Man, okay? Peace be upon you. And peace be upon you. Help! Miss? -Help! Help! -Miss?! Help! Help me! Miss? Make her drink this. -Thank you Drink this water, Thank you! Man…I'm going back now...if there's anything, you know where to find me. Alright. Thank you! I'm going home now. Peace be upon you. And peace be upon you Ustaz! Please excuse me. Honey! Are you okay? Pak Man…what actually happened? Zaidy… Yes, Pak Man? If there's nothing else, I'm going home now. Okay? Pak Man! Yes? Can I ask something? What's that? Pak Man, do you know the ustaz that've helped Linda just now? Yes He opens an islamic medical center in town. But after one incident, he was being boycott by the villagers….his house is not that far from here. Boycott?? What happened? He was accused of using black magic during the medication process... and Pak Leman's daughter died because of that too. Daughter? No wonder he hates the ustaz so much. Zaidy, actually…Ustaz Aznan... ...that's okay. I go back first, okay? Zaidy… Yes, Pak Man? Can I ask you something? Can. Why didn't you tell your wife about your late grandmother? I think she have the right to know. I'm not sure how to tell her… because I don't believe in the supernatural things. It's like this…I pity her. It looks like she's carrying the trouble. At least if she knows the history of this house... I understand About Ustaz Aznan…I think it's best for you to go and see him yourself. With Allah's willing, he can help you. With Allah's willing. Please excuse me for now. Sayang! Sayang! Sayang! Sayang! Sayang! -Honey! Honey! Something bitting my toe! Where? There's something! There's something! Honey! Honey! Nothing...there's nothing. Please look…look! There's nothing. Peace be upon you! Peace be upon you! And peace be upon you! Aren't you afraid of getting boycott by the villagers for coming here? I'm sorry. I come here with no intention to bother you or Ustaz. I want to thank both of you. How is your wife ? That's why I'm here. I want to ask Ustaz about my wife. Ever since she's 5 months old pregnant, a lot of strange things started to happen. I'm sorry. Honestly, I don’t want to get involve in this matter. It's best for you to look for another person to help your wife. Help my wife? What do you mean? Did she got exposed to black magic? Or has it got something to do with my late grandmother's 'Saka' agreement? As human, we’re imperfect… and we keep on doing mistakes… The best way is to repent back to Allah. No one can cure a person without Allah's permission. Ustaz... have my wife done something that causes Allah's wrath? I can't answer that… it's you, yourself have to look for the answer… There are plenty secrets in your house. Plenty of secrets in the house? Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you. And peace be upon you. Yes? I'm Zaidy…can I see Pak Leman? Ouhh Zaidy…sure can…please come in. Let me call him yes? Ah…please… Thank you. Pak Leman... -Why did you come to my house this late? I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour… I've something important to ask you. What? Do you know the story about my family house? I mean, other story apart from how my late grandmother past away. Nothing has happened to your family house since 5 years back. And about your late grandmother's 'Saka'…there was no news for a long time. When I met Ustaz Aznan, he said… That's enough! He's a scumbag… I've told you earlier…don't get close to him… He likes to create stories to scare the villagers so that they will go to him for treatment… He just want money. Pak Leman…actually what happened to your daughter? You don't have to know that… all you need to know is, that Ustaz is a black magic practitioner… ...don't get close to him! Linda! Linda!! Linda!! Honey! Linda! Linda! Honey! Honey! Honey! Honey, where are you going? Sayang! Honey. Honey? Honey! Honey get up Honey! Honey! Honey! Sayang! Sayang, you are... Sayang! Sayang! Sayang! Sayang? Why didn't you wake me up? You're ready. I haven't prepare your breakfast. It's ok…I don't want to bother you. I want you to rest more. I apologize to you… I don't know what happened…I feel so weak entering the 7 months of pregnancy. Honey! Your belly is getting bigger. That's why you get tired easily. My child? My child...what are you doing? Please don't be naughty, okay? Mummy will get tired quickly. Eh, why are you saying like that? You should go to work now…I want to clean-up the house…then, bath. Honey?! What happened to your skin? Doesn't it hurt? No… How is my wife, doctor? She's okay. No need to worry. After the check-ups, it is just a normal allergy. From the record, it looks like she do have an allergy history. Now she's pregnant, the allergy can get worst. All praise to Allah. But doctor, is it true what people said about sometimes it can happen because of the baby in the womb? Yes true, it can also happen that way, because of the changes in the hormone. But it's alright. Don't worry. For now, I'll give an ointment to apply first. Okay? But, if the allergy gets worse…come and see me. Alright, thank you doctor. Honey? Stop…don't think so much about it. The doctor said it was nothing. Do you want anything? Tea? If you want, I'll make for you. It's okay, I'm not thirsty. If you're sleepy, you should go to bed first. Sure? I want to take some fresh air. You sure? Yes. Okay, but don't take too long. Sayang! Sayang! Sayang! Sayang! -Honey? Honey? -Sayang! Honey! Honey? What's wrong? I'm scared. I'm scared! Honey? What happened to me? I'm scared! Honey... It was nothing. Please don't think so much. It was just your feeling. Okay? I'm here! I'm here! Peace be upon you! Ma? Why are looking at me as if I'm a ghost? Why didn't you tell that you're coming? To see my own son, I've to make an appointment? It's not like that, ma. I'm just afraid we're not around. Luckily, we are here now. Where's Linda? Still sleeping? Why is she not preparing breakfast for you, Zaidy? Honey, mama is here. Come, let's see her for awhile. Wait for awhile. I'll come out shortly. Please don't take so long. Okay. Linda will come out shortly. She just took her bath. You sleep here tonight okay? After I finish my class, we eat together. Okay? We'll see how later... ….I come here to see how Linda is doing…. Both of you aren't telling me anything, right? Is my grandchild doing okay? Okay! Ma…I'll go first, okay? Zaidy, are you hiding things from me? I'm late! We'll talk later. Take care now. Mama? Madam? Are you okay? Pak Man, can you please bring me the broom? Okay. Have a drink, ma. Something is not right about the aura in this house. Linda, you're not keeping 'things' right? Or casts black magic on my son? What are you saying? Of course not! I feel something… ...I feel as if there's someone is watching me since I came. I'm not sure. Honestly, I always feel the same like you do…. But when I asked Zaidy about this house and late grandmother...he avoids telling me. Be honest with me, are you hiding things from Zaidy? Peace be upon you. Mama left? I just bought us foods. I thought she's going back at night. Okay, I'm on the way back now. Okay. I'm sorry. Not that I don't want to help you… But your wife's matter involves disgrace of people…I'm not willing. What do you mean? Your wife, she's in danger… It's best for you to seek someone who can help her before it's too late just like Pak Leman's daughter. What it has got to do with Pak Leman's daughter and my wife? It's best for you to ask Pak Leman yourself…I'm sorry. Pak Man…Pak Man!! Please tell me!! What actually happened between Pak Leman and Ustaz Aznan? Ustaz! Please help Ustaz! Please help heal my daughter. It's painful! Pak Leman… ...your daughter, she have made a mistake… She have made an agreement and slept with a shaman, who is practising black magic. I'm sorry, father! I've to do all this…because…because my husband wants a child… We were married for 5 years but failed to have one. He was going to marry another woman if I don’t give him his child. Ustaz! Please help her! I'll be in humiliation if all the villagers know about this. Please Ustaz! Okay, Pak Leman! I'll do what I can. Mizah. O Allah O Allah Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji'un (We surely belong to Allah and to Him we shall return.) No wonder Pak Leman is angry. He accused Ustaz Aznan for the caused of his daughter's death. But in actual… He was the village headman at that time… The best solution for Ustaz Aznan was to keep quiet. Although, Pak Leman has accused him of many things. But what's all that got to do with my wife, Pak Man? What's Ustaz Aznan trying to tell me? Huh, Pak Man? I thought Mama wants to sleep here tonight… of all the sudden she left… Did she said anything to you? No, she didn't. Take a seat. I'm going to bring you some water. Honey! Honey! Okay! Okay! Seat down…seat down... Wait here, I'll get the drink. Honey? Honey? Honey? Honey? Are you okay? I'm so sorry, sayang! I'm really, really sorry… What are you saying? O Allah…honey….honey? What's the matter with you? This child... this child is not yours! If it's not mine, then who's child is it? Yes, I can give whatever you desire and dream... as long as you're willing to fulfill all the required conditions. Can you? Every year I was curse, clapperclaw, insulted… yes, I'm willing to fulfill the requirements… I need to have descendants. Yes. Alright! Why? Why did you do all these to me? Didn't you realize that you've made an agreement with the satan? Don't you realize it? Sayang, I'm really sorry ... Don't you know, I was so much in pressure? I was at a dead end. I didn't know what to do… Your mother keeps on blaming me because I couldn't give you your child. I'm scare of losing you…I love you. Not even once did I ever put the blame on you… All rezq comes from Allah… But what you've done is all wrong!! Do you know that??!! You've cheated me, right? I can't believe you've the heart to cheat me! What kind of wife, are you ? The child that you're carrying is the devil's child…don't you know that?? Sayang! Sayang, please sayang! Please forgive me! I can't live witthout you. I'm begging you. Please forgive me! Please...Sayang! Sayang! Sayang! Linda! Sayang! Sayang! Sayang! Satan, open this door, Satan! Sayang! Honey! Honey! Open this door! Honey! Woi Satan!!! Don't disturb my wife! Open this door! Honey! Woi!!! Open this door!!! Linda!! Open this door right now, Satan!! -Zaidy! Don't you dare do anything to my wife!! What's wrong? Linda is inside. I don't know…She's inside, Open the door! Open this door! Sayang! Ustaz, Puan Linda is trapped inside, in a room. I've tried to open the door but it cannot be open… Have you try to open all? I have. The door, the window…I've tried all. Okay…we've to take action right now. Come! Sayang! Zaidy!! Ustaz, you've got to help me. Patient. Ustaz!! Zaidy! Mama! I'll explain later. For now, we need to help Linda because her life is in danger!! In danger? Let Ustaz do his work. Sayang! Sayang! Azaan! Azaan sweetheart! Azaan! Azaan! The azaan, now! Now! Azaan azaan!! Now! Now! Azaan now! Man. Alright Ustaz! Teacher! Sayang! Sayang! I'm sorry! I know I've committed so many sins to you. But, I never meant to cheat you! No! No! You've done nothing wrong to me…. Mama! Mama! Ustaz! Honey! Zaidy, guide Linda the Syahadah. Lailahaillaallah. Lailahaillaallah. Honey! Honey! Honey! Peace be upon you! And peace be upon you! And peace be upon you! Ustaz! I seek for your apology…. because of my sins of slandering you…the whole village has boycotted you… I'm really sorry, Ustaz. Yes, Pak Leman! Pak Leman ,have a sit. Yes. I'm sorry that I didn't tell you earlier... I'm at fault too... …for all that has happened, more or less, it started from me. That's why I came here yesterday… I went to see Ustaz Aznan to ask for his help. How did you know, Ustaz Aznan? I told her… When Ustaz Aznan told me about Puan Linda…I've immediately told your mother. Actually, All the things that occured earlier has got nothing to do with the 'Saka' or if the house was haunted… but it happens after your wife enters the agreement. No wonder ustaz were saying that this matter will expose a person's bad deeds. Zaidy…the baby is innocent… Have pity on her. Here! Eh, the shoes popped out! Linda! Sweetheart? Please stop playing. Okay Papa! Are the bags all ready? Yes! Come, let's go...we'll be late! Sweetheart, who were you playing with? Mother!
