The facts and the people from this movie are real or inspired from reality. Creating the script, the director SERGIU NICOLAESCU used documents, memories, letters, newspapers from that epoch and also literary and cinematographic works, some of them originals, from the romanian contemporary writers. This movie is dedicated to those who shed their blood for the Motherland between 1877-1878 9 MAY 1877 What it is, huh..? Good evening. Good evening. Miss Maria Cerchez, the daughter of the Colonel. Good evening. Good evening to you, Professor. Good evening. Please allow me. Good evening Sir. Ah, good evening mister Margineanu. This is Major Sontu. Please to meet you. Lieutenant Bordeianu. Good evening. And Miss Oltet. Good evening. The National Assembly, realising the broken ties with Turkey, and seeing a upcoming war declares that Romania, as a sovereign state, has the right of a life of his own. It puts his trust in the sentiments of justice of the European powers, which are guarantees and has a total trust in his Government which will work with the courage and patriotism required by the situation. And so, I ask you mister deputies, to proceed with the vote. Please. Again we live a little bit of history, dear Mihai. The one who dreamt the most about this moment, sadly is not among us... Nicu Balcescu.. Or maybe he is... What are they waiting for, old Tudor? I came from far away and they are doing nothing... Be quiet.. When will they give me a uniform and a sword, because I... I received a letter from your father. He says that your poor mother cries all the time because you told her nothing... I was at the mill, and then this feeling rose into me I couldn't bear it any more, so I came here. Well you came, but the Government of Vienna made a Protest, and request that we send you back. (to occupied Transylvania). From now on, the Government of Vienna shall be interested in its own problems, because I got my own ones. And what shall we do, Mister Gherea? (Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea) What does your conscience of socialists dictate to you all? Well as Socialists, we can tell that we are against the oppression or subjugation of the man against another man. And thus we stand against the oppression and subjugation of a nation by another nation. We want that the injust, inhuman and unworthy domination by a century of a nation by another nation, to come to an end! We want the Romanian people to be free, and to have a State of their own. And never again should suffer under foreign dominance. You spoke quite well, Mister Ionescu. (Tache Ionescu) Only the development of a free nation, it's needed by a Socialist movement. So what can we do then? What do you mean, we will enlist as volunteers, right? I want to come too! I am sure that they need Medical Nurses too! Isn't it,,mister Gherea? I am sure! Will you also come, professor? Well, as a professor I can not be lower than my students. Moreover as an old socialist. Second Lieutenant. Pardon me, but I am a highschool graduate and I want to enlist as a volunteer, do you think that it can be possible? Well Sir, as a graduate you can proceed a Military School of 6 Months, and after that you will graduate as a second lieutenant in the Army Reserves. You think so? I am sure! This vote decided the situation! No further comment is needed any more! In a state of war with the old ties broken, What are we? WE ARE A INDEPENDENT PEOPLE! WE ARE A SOVEREIGN NATION! But the definition and accomplishment of our Independence, in an absolute way must be also accepted by Europe! But here is the matter, were the cold blood is asked! For what I care, I do not worry about the notes of the Turkish Government! What worries me the most are the words spoken at the Parliament's Tribune in London which claims that Romania is a part of the Ottoman Empire. so the Turkish Army has the right to cross the Danube. And so, what shall we do, sit like dead people? No, gentlemen! Because no one and nothing can help the dead any more! (Romanian Patriotic Song, Current National Anthem) Wake up, Romanian, from your deadly sleep into which you've been sunk by the barbaric tyrants Now or never your fate renew To which even your cruel enemies will bow down. Look, glorious shadows, Mihai, Stefan, Corvin The Romanian nation, your great grandchildren We have to prove that we are a living nation! That we are aware of our value! That we are able to make sacrifices, so that we can keep this nation and its rights, for our children! And this holy mission is entrust to our brothers and our sons that will die on the borders! Artillery, fire! FOR THE MOTHERLAND Hey you, stop! Stop, you! Stop, Nita! Stop you! Stop! Encircle them! Now! Why are you beating me!? This shall be enough for you! It is not properly that a Rachovan, should risk his life for a Hohenzollern. What is your opinion about this, Iaristid? The Hohenzollern Dynasty, has a very respectable past. But the Family of the Rachovan Barons, on the other hand has a great future on his side.. We must think about it very seriously. But even so, it seems like that a presence is necessary, of course a symbolic presence only, a dignified presence accompanied of gestures and actions of no risks what so ever. What is it, Gogu? Baron sir, we caught Nita Ion. He held a great wedding party... What!? The one who is in big debt to me was making a great wedding party!? And what did you do!? I send my people to bring him to the Town hall. Oh, to the Town Hall!? Shall he not get mad!? Maybe he wants even my carriage to bring his wife on the wedding journey, the little devil. Fine, I will come too! All right, Sir. ORDER! ATTENTION TO ME! THERE WILL BE WAR! WITH THE TURK AND EVERY SOUL UNTIL THE 40 YEARS! THE ONES WITH THE ARMY SERVICE DONE PRESENT YOURSELF HERE TO THE TOWN HALL! THE YOUNG MEN WITH NO MILITARY TRAINING WHO WANTS TO VOLUNTEER HIMSELF DO IT! BECAUSE IT IS NEEDED!

THE SOLDIER OR THE VOLUNTEER SHALL TAKE WITH HIM SOME CLOTHES AND SHOES! WARM HATS! TABACCO IF HE HAVE THE BAD ABITUDE AND SOME FOOD TO LAST FOR 3 DAYS! Mister Pandelache! Mister Pandelache!

Quiet down you foal, look I enlisted you, can't you see? Enlist Nita Ion! What is with you. What s the matter with you, do you marry or what? Look, at the wedding, those thieves forced their way it against me. Saying that I waste money while I am not paying the debts... But now that you are here, I will enlist myself as a volunteer... Did you write his name, Zancheu? Yes, Sir! Good. Voichita! Voichita! Baron Sir! Baron sir! What is going oh here huh!? He enlisted as a volunteer. Nita Ion is in debt with me with 80 work days! He lie Major Sir! After he took the land of my father, which our King Cuza Voda - the praised one-gave to him he wants another 80 work days from me! Did you enlist him already? Of course Sir, I did enlist him! Well, then I am sorry. Major, I am warning you that I am a depute of the Parliament. and my and my family connections might bring you some nuisance in the future! Then consider that you warned me about it, Sir! But I respect the Decision taken by the Nation's Parliament. We will marry after all of this, Major! First lets beat the Turks and after...we will see! Brother! Brother! Do not leave me here, take me with you! Are you crazy!? It is not possible! Come on, brother! Come on! Hear, Ioana, come here. Come here. What? Come on faster! Wait a minute! Brother! Brother! DO NOT LEAVE ME HERE ALONE! Brother! Brother! Can't you hear me!? Take me with you please... Brother! Take me with you... Can't you hear...? Brother... Take me with you please... Brother! Brother! You escaped her... It was harder than escaping the devil, I tell you.. She says that she is scared alone at home. Didn't I tell you to tie her up? I did! I did indeed! But she escaped! How stubborn she is... You will find yourself in great problems with her, I tell you... Brother? Huh.. You?! What did you do, you cut your hair! Please do not leave me alone, take me with you! Tell me Stan, what shall I do with her? Tell the Major! Please have mercy... To hell I will tell the Major.. Come on, let's go. Come on, don't you hear!? What, you are afraid at home and not at war!? You will see, you will see... Come on brother, the grandfather is nearly awake and he will ruin my plans! Look, the evening came and you keep me in place. When we will start going it will be night! What night, you fool? Don't you know!? And you say I am the fool.. You are making me angry! Until now you fooled me with nice words, and now keep silent as a fly, right!? And you call yourself my brother!? I will be damned if I will polish your boots any more with wax! Come on,Turcane, come on faster! I am ready! Culita, you must stay home. Why should I stay, what shall I do home!? If grandfather dies, someone will be needed to bury him. Someone is needed to take care of the cows and feed them... From now on you are the "pillar of the house", Take care of mother. Dear mother, bless me please. Shall all of you return home healthy, And the fire, the water and the steel shall bypass you. and all the disgraces will avoid you, so that you can come to the land and to the cows. Mister Mehmed Ali, you are awaited. Please. I am late your Excellency, I am sorry. The roads and specials conditions are the fault.. If we are to talk about a true delay, it's about some hundreds of years... But please, sit. What importance has a half of hour of delay? Your Excellency. I am authorised to communicate you from Savat Pasa, that his majesty Sultan's Government, considers Romania as a Modern State with the dignity of not being supervised any more and considers to recognize it the total independence. Is this intention materialized in any official declaration Sir? You are sure aware, your excellency, about the internal situation of the Empire at the moment, about the unrest in Constantinople. The rebellion in Monte Negro and Bulgaria Which, as we know, some people from your country, even Officials, encouraged and helped. It is an old blemish of those oppressed to help each other... And above all of this, Minister, the mentally ill state of the Old, Previous Sultan Abdul Azis can be added in this situation... And even the fight of those who want a modern constitutional Turkey, and all the traditional and religious factors. But now the Sultan gave to all his subjects, a liberal Constitution. Well this Constitution, which tries to save what noone can saved anymore, is the written document that should guarantee our independence... But fortunately sir, the times of Oriental cheap talk is well gone! The Liberal Constitution of 1876 which you talked about, sees for Romania the Status of a province, it's true, privileged of the Ottoman Empire! You must admit that this means at least a element of Progress. That shall mean to you Sir, but for Romania it represents a trap, which make us smile! What the most powerful Sultans could not gain, like Baiazid and Suleiman il Magnificent, meaning the transformation of the Romanian Principates into Ottoman "Pasalic" like it did happen in Budapest in 1524, your renewing liberals think that they will obtain! Not with the sword, but with a Constitution that decides our destiny And which we only learned from the newspapers... That procedure, from my own strict opinion, was indeed a unforgivable mistake. To use your own wise expression, not because of us our relations with the Ottoman Empire were only a long string of "unforgivable mistakes"?. I ask you, sir! Who broke the Old Capitulations signed by Mircea the Old and Stefan the Great? Signed through force, because even then Europe didn't understand the historic significance of the Romanian lands here, at the crossroad of the great interests! Who and on what grounds gave Bucovina Region to Austria in 1775, assassinating its legitimate ruler, Grigore Ghica Voda? We had to bow before the Arms. Herr von Bismark himself formulated with a genius mind this political axioma "Die Macht Geht, den recht vor", "the Force is above any right".. When the world will get rid from the call of such dark geniuses, the mankind will die of old age... And after all what do you want? At the moment,the Russian Army is defeated by the Forces of Osman Pasa. Thus, the Russian troops across the Danube will be in great difficulty.. Our Garrisons from Vidin, Smardan, and Rahova will cut their way out. It will be a disaster for them.. Please, go on. He request you to not enter the battle. To not aid the Russian Armies. And in the case of their retreat, to allow the turkish troops to cross on your Lands, to follow them. And...eventually... only if it will be the case... And so, to attack in this essential moment the Imperial Russian Army from behind? And surrender it in the hands of Osman Pasa, all together with his Majesty the Tsar, himself on the Field of Battle, and then? Accept your liberal Constitution that declare us unwillingly as a Province of the Ottoman Empire... The capacity of your political awareness is extraordinary... Our fruitless conversation has ended.. But if you want to go back to a state of neutrality, and only allowing us to follow the enemy on your own territory His Majesty the Sultan will consider this hypothesis as sufficient... I would like to tell you a secret. If today, 19 July 1877, any Romanian politician, would absurdly accept your propositions the situation could not be changed! I don't understand... It is obvious! This war belongs to the entire Romanian nation, the people started it! And it was its right to start it and our duty to follow it! Now you understand!? And if you need a place to play as your honour field of battle, please choose it wherever you desire! But not on our fields! Stop! What is going on? Stay there! (Speaking Russian) Water..! Water...! Water...! What does he want, brother Ion? I do not know, but he wants something.. maybe he is calling his mother.. No, he is thirsty, poor lad.. Don't you see that he wants water..? I'll go to give him some.. Here, drink, drink. (In Russian) Company! Listen to my Command, Forward! What is your name, soldier? Ciuca Grigore, 5th Regiment, Second Battalion, third Company! Why are you answering in his place? He is my brother Captain, and Grigore is a little wimp, he looses his taughts sometimes.. Come on, go back in line. Understood sir! Now that you are folowing me ("after my ass") all the time, stop crying. What, you are scared right!? Yes, I want to return home, brother... What? Do you want to be a deserter..? And you taught that this is a circus, right? You crazy woman... Be calm my dear. The war has his own rules. Yes, we wait, we wait new orders. Orders, Colonel? Anything new? No, Sir. Good. What is happening here!? Are you crazy!? Stop it! What is happening here!? Attention! I asked what is happening here, report! General Sir...they were fighting each other.. I saw this! General! I am Sergeant Constantin Turcano from the 13 Dorobanti-Dies Regiment! They are offending us, and we cannot not bear any more, they call us "Turkeys"! Everybody make fun of us! Change this nickname in a official name! Sub-Lieutenant Spiroiu! At your orders! You have 3 days of Severe Penalty! Yes, General! And you, from were you are? General sir, I am Sergeant Ciuca Ioan, from the 2nd Infantry Regiment Gorj. And I must report we came not too long ago, and we wanted to laugh a little bit, but those Moldovans (nord est of Romania) don't know what a joke is... Colonel, you will create a Mixed Regiment from the Dorobanti from Iasi and the Infantrymen from Gorj, they will remain together until the end of the War! Understood! It will be called the Special Regiment Near the 3rd Division. Goodbye, men! Long live General Sir! What did you say what your name is, huh? Stefan Ionescu Sergeant Sir. From were do you know this skill, like a true armourer? From Vienna, sergeant. My Baron sent me to Vienna, to the Manlicher armoires You bet you might also know German... I know indeed, Sergeant. Then say some words. Es ist schön zum Sterben für freiheit und Frieden. Well done, you. I will request a Promotion for you, I see that you have some abilities. I have the feeling that there is movement on the other side... You are right, it seems there is some squeaking of wheels. I wonder if we shouldn't open fire. Yes,we should fire some cannon balls but, you know that his Majesty is inflexible. We can fire only as a response. Do you think that the Turks are leaving their Vidin so that they can go to Plevna? Bogdan! Ask the Commander of the Artillery Batteries to be kind and come here. Understood! What is happening in Plevna? On this battle hangs our entire fate, and we just sit and sit... And we limit ourselves only to respond against the Turkish Artillery Salvoes... Dear Valter, if the Russians will be beaten, and if Osman Pasa will exploit his success, then we won't stay anymore. But If Osman Pasa will be crushed, what is our point here then? To act like military Police the Fortresses on Danube Shores? Or to guard the turkish prisoners as I heard that the Duke Nicolae of Russia requested? Yes, the Duke indeed requested that, but do you know what our response was? The Romanian Army will only guard their own prisoners of war and the cities won trough battle! But after all, politics doesn't concern us. We execute orders.. "Moncher" (my dear), why don't you let me sleep when outside is peace and quiet? Moncher, just because there is no quiet. I am sure that the Turks are detaching units from Vidin, just listen.. In 10 minutes we'll open fire, is it clear? Understood! BATTERY, FIRE! Halt! Give the Password! Mircea the Elder! Posada! BATTERY, FIRE! Reload! Coriolanus!? See what is with him! What's the matter, boy? Volunteer? Yes, your highness! What is your name? Coriolanus Brad. Coriolanus? Yes, your highness! They baptise us this way, if not the Austro-Hungary will change our names. From Ion, they will make us Janos, from Petru, Peter. And so, our parents name us Traian, Romulus, Remus... Your highness, allow me to report, If find necessary to open fire, as the Turks in Vidin... Fine! At the general quarters I received the same information, that the Turks are leaving Vidin and are moving to Lompa Lanca. Allow me your highness. Speak! Allow me to report, at the general quarters from Poiana, a special telegram was received for you, from the grand Duke Nicolae of Russia, you are urgently called. Yes...our horses then... Understood. All right, boys! Long live, your highness! Attention! The telegram came 40 minutes ago, your highness. I think Gentlemen, that this is the signal we all have waited for. (Speaking French) The military Situation should be very hard for the Great Duke, if he appealed to such a telegram. I suggest that we shall give them all the help needed, any time and as much as they need. If not, the Turks might throw them over the Danube shores. And thus, Romania might become the theatre of war. If your highness decides, we can give a order at once. The 4th division must reinforce the romanian Garrison of Nicopole. And the 3rd Infantry division, must cross the Jiu river and to take the position of the 4th division. Likewise, we must start at once the building of the bridge across the Danube. I order the opening of fire across the entire Danube river, specially at Vidin. Mister Bratianu, Mister Colonel Vrainiceanu, will go to the Headquarters of the Russian Army. And will ensure the conditions with the Russian Army, for the Romanian forces to cross the Danube. I want you to mention to our friends and allies that Romanian Army will go into combat, but only under the command of his supreme commander. Gentlemen, good night. I am so happy that you are, finally, with me here. I believe that all the dificulties have been removed. Sire, I would have come at once after receiving your telegram, but I had to prepare the crossing of the Danube.. Very well. Here is after all, the collaboration we all much wanted and desired. A collaboration that was temporally blocked, by stupid and cheap politics wickedness. Mon cousin (My cousin), I am happy that after all, we are here together. The reports I received, inform me of the brave army eager to fight. All it is left, is for us to clear up a detail. Are you still sure and confident to lead the Romanian Army? This is indeed, out of any discussion! Yes, yes, but this decision, which I even predicted, creates some difficulties... You, Ruling Prince, can not be put under the command of any Russian General. That is clear, but a number of Russian Generals can be put under the Command of the Romanian Ruler. Then, it is decided Nicola. The Romanian Prince will take the command of the troops in front of Plevna. An army, which will be named the Western Army. When can you go into battle? Tomorrow my troops will cross the Danube river. And in 2 days, we will be at Plevna. Arrange your hat properly, trumpeter! DIVISION! FOR HONOURS, PRESENT ARMS! Your Highness, the Romanian troops are ready to cross the Danube river! What is wrong, Nita? I am..I am a little dizzy... Get behind then.. What is wrong with you, boy? I am feeling sick.. Come, come sit down, I will give you some water. Here, drink, it will do you good. HEALTH, CHILDREN! LONG LIVE YOUR HIGHNESS! SOLDIERS! IT HAS BEEN MORE THAN ONE YEAR, SINCE THE FIGHT ACROSS THE DANUBE PUTS OUR LAND IN DANGER! FOR DEFENCE ITSELF, OUR NATION APPEALED TO YOU!

How can you allow yourself, to hit a Romanian Soldier in such moments!? Major sir, this soldier hide, with hoping that no one will see him.. Next time, avoid me, Capitan! What happened..? You will bravely return home, accompanied by the cheering of our entire nation! DIVISION! FORWARD! MARCH! (Romanian Patriotic Song, "Farewell, farewell, drums play") Voichita...! Voichita...! Were are you going!? Wait, mother! Where is he!? I don't see him! Do not worry my dear, he'll came.. even if you don't see him now. But the Turks...Eh the Turks! Don't you worry, the Turks are not so tough! Farewell, farewell, drums play, farewell dear romanians With the bag tied behind With our arms in hands Either on sunny days Or on cloudy sky Either rain or snow Gladly we go. Farewell, farewell, drums play, dear romanians With the bag tied behind With our arms in hands Either at the parade or at war. Everyone in a row Cheerful we go. Farewell, farewell, drums play, Farewell, dear romanians With the bag tied behind With our arms in hands The flag should shine We live for it. Country to flourish We die for it. Quicklier! HALT!

The order is to dig on this hill, and to send patrols to find the Turkish lines! Are they far, lieutenant sir? I have no idea! It is clear, right? Lieutenant Bordeianu, take with you few solders, and check if on our right flank you can find the 1st Dorobanti Battalion. Sergeant! At your orders! Take 3 good soldiers with you and go into a recognisance until you find the Turks! Do not fire! Everything must be done in perfect quiet! Understood! The rest are ordered to dig the trenches, execute! Penes... and you too... We leave all behind and all that we take is our bayonets, yes, execute! Come trough here, come. Get down! I heard something...Come on! Brother Ion..I am scared... Shhh...follow me. Hey, Turkey, what language do they speak, because I know only "Olteneste"...(Oltenia-south part of Romania) It's not Russian... Shh, you sit there and do not move! Ready...? Up...up! Give me your hand! Didn't I tell you di stay here...!? Shut up! Come! BATTERY, FIRE! The bloody German does know his skill... Watch out, he can hear you sergeant, and he'll get mad! So what!? He is German! Even if his mother was Romanian... He even have German name too, Hartel, is this a Romanian name? BATTERY, FIRE! Sergeant Zacheu, come here! You lift up the 4th cannon about 2 fingers, and 1 finger at the right side, execute! All right... Sergeant... What did you say!? I understood your order, Lieutenant! Execute! Ready, Sergeant? I must go... Where...? Where, where...you know... Search for a bush then.. Then...I beg you not to watch... because I don't go outside... What a woman... Blonde like a angel... You know Macri? It's been a while. He is one of the best... The 13th attacked Verdan.. What are those flames near the fortifications...? Those are mines... Aaa, mines... Oh what a fire the endure the 13th... What can't we help our guys, Sergeant? Get on your place soldier, and wait further orders! What orders, sir!? To let the Turks slaughter our own!? From where are the 13nd from? From Iasi.. Poor lads... Is it hard, Brother Ion? Hard or not, that's the way it is, we are not the first nor the last, that will die for our country.. That's right... But why die, Lieutenant? Let us live and be happy, that's why we are fighting for... I raise this cup of Champagne to the first Victory reported by the Young Romanian Army, at the Plevna Front. I drink for the health of the Romanian army, to its bravery and its conduct. I drink for the health of its supreme Commander. Your excellency! Yesterday I could see the most formidable attack commanded by general... Gentlemen... Even if few delays existed, the War Council decided that tomorrow, the name day of the Great Tsar, a decisive attack will be carried on against Plevna. This glory will belong to the Western Army, commanded by the Romanian ruler. Tomorrow will not be a easy day. The attack will start at 3 a clock, from these directions: From South a detachment leaded by Prince Detimsky, From South East, the main Russian Forces commanded by the General Critner, And from the Northern side, the Romanian Army commanded by General Cernat. The mentioned troops, can proceed to the ordered positions even from today. And in the meanwhile, you will receive detailed orders... And so, as the Great Duke mentioned, tomorrow 30 August, 38.000 Soldiers and Romanian Officers, together with 52.000 soldiers and Russian officers, under your command will start the decisive battle for Plevna... I wish you luck. Come on guys, hurry up... Lieutenant...we came here to fight... and not to dig holes... Be quiet sergeant...and be thankful that you are not in their place... Come on...dig... Well...I don't know what you are all thinking about. But personally, I would never want to be buried on foreign soil, and to be eaten by maggots... Be quiet brother Ion... Yes...yes I will.. But swear to me, and if it will be the case, you will not bury me. Better to set me in fire...and put black powder under me so that nothing remains... if you can not bury me at home.. What in the heavens is wrong with him...? Hey! You swear, or not? We do. We do, brother Ion... Don't you cry, or I will slap you, do you hear? Calm down... FIRE! FIRE! RELOAD! FIRE! Officers, you are free, only Division Commanders shall remain. I do not desire to hide my worries from you.. In the first place, I am surprised that Prince Carol gave away to the requests of the Great Duke, That this battle shall start tomorrow, 30 August... We will have high loses. And even if I have not the right, I doubt that Plevna will fall... It is absurd that for the birthday of a monarch, we should sacrifice thousands of Soldiers... We will do every single thing in our power, to gain this victory! I request you to respect and follow in great detail, the instructions of the General quarters... And always be as close as you can to your soldiers... Good night gentlemen... Mihai! Tomorrow is the first big battle that we carry on.. The lives of more than 40.000 men depends on us,... The independence of this country depends on us... The future of millions of Romanians... I would prefer that tomorrow I 'll enter the battle as a simple soldier.. Do you think I am scared? Or that I run from responsibility? Listen, Alexandru. If so, why didn't you stand against this attack when you had the chance? Because I am a military man! And I must execute the orders of my superiors. Because.. Go on. Because we created this Army.. ..and I feel it as my own loved child... But sadly, it has not yet received his "baptism of fire", and it is normal for me to desire, to want and to assure this baptism the most favourable conditions.. Come with me at the camp. It is a long night. I just came across here, and brought the Attack Order for tomorrow to sign it... But I see that Prince Carol didn't sign it yet... The Prince asked me to convince the Grand Duke, to postpone the attack... And could you convince him? Please believe me, I tried my best to convince him, but I couldn't.. Please, sign it, too... My dear, I can never make up for the splendid night I spend on your mansion... Your words please me very much... But sadly I must leave... Leave...why leave? Tomorrow morning I must carry on a recognisance of the land... But look, here I carried on the fight 10 days ago, and every stone, every piece of land, are recorded here... But what can I do, Cernat is jealous of me. Ah Cernat..champagne, please. It is 2 o'clock at night... from yesterday morning the cannons don't stop firing... I couldn't sleep for 24 hours... It is spoken that tomorrow we will attack Grivita... Maria, the Colonel is here... Thank you Are you well? Yes, dad. Do you need anything else? No, I don't need anything. Tomorrow it will be a hard attack... In which regiment are you enlisted? 13th Dorobanti, father... Take care of yourself... The attack of tomorrow is imminent, 30 august is the onomastic of the Tsar... The Commanders of the russian army... need after all a victory to dedicate it to him... We would have done the same, too... The Russians surprised our allies at Sevastopol, with the fortifications made by General Totleben. Eh then, I will surprise the Russians, with your own fortifications... The artillery stopped... What are they saying... They are praying! How come do you know, huh? Well I am from Dobrogea, Sergeant Sir, I know them very well. Hey, Trumpet Boy! Sound the wake-up call! So that the Turks can hear our songs too. Wake up brother..wake up! Bow to the ground, you! Because Mohamed will soon take care of you! But today I am your Mohamed! Damn it! BATTERY, FIRE! A message, sir! Sergeant Zavheu, to me! Yes sir! At your orders! At 3 a clock, we will accompany the attack of the 13rd Dorobanti. Why the 13th, why not the 11rd or the others!? I understood sir... Bring the horses, Come on, bring the horses, why are you standing there? Ready Corporal...Fire! What a surprise! What news do you bring from the 4th Division, major Sir...? I was called at the operations Command and...I saw you.. I heard that you will start the attack. Well not me, I am the second line, and the one that has the honour to be first is Major Sontu.. Grozea, I am Grozea. I just protested that the attack only begins at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and to be honest, it is pure madness... How can we exploit our advantages in the darkness if we should make it? And what we'll do if we won't succeed..? Well, my dears, your propensity to criticize proves our Latin origins.. but becomes dangerous as long as we wear our informs... Well as Major Officer you should... As Major Officer I must do everything possible for this attack to be successful./ No mater the hour it was ordered to. Are you nervous? You will laugh, I'm so peaceful, I feel that nothing can happen to me... Even so, this is for my wife... You, personally, made the recognisance of the land? Yes, General..! Thus, your observations are the same as on this map... From the line of attack, to the Fortifications of Grivita, there will be a hilly terrain, distance, 900 meters... Indeed, General. All right, thank you. Let's go, gentlemen... Those bloody turks! What, they think are braver that you!? Raise the Cannon 2 fingers more! BATERY FIRE! Gentlemen, it is time to go.. Your highness... What it is...? General Scobelev started the battle already... Why...!? Please excuse us. What indiscipline! Always Scobelev... What is, Tahir Pasa? The last informations brought up by our scouts From early in the morning, from hour to hour until now, there have been troop movements, The Romanian 4th division, and the 9th Corps of General Krugner, will probably attack Grivita 1. The 3rd Romanian Division occupies a front of 90 degrees in front of Grivita 2 Fortification. And another Romanian division is placed between those 2 division, 2 Km behind, looks like the biggest one... And, a Russian-Romanian Cavalry Brigade has also been seen at 8 o'clock at the shores between Vid and Opanez.. At South, the Russian army seems to be also in great numbers.. What time it is? 12:15 your highness. The Fortifications of Grivita and Opalez are the most important on the road that leaves to Plevna... Send reinforcements...and enough ammunition. And order the officers and troops absolutely not to retreat! Boys, be brave and advance with courage! We were honoured to start the battle! Let's be worthy of that! Let's show that we are Romanians, and that the enemy don't scare us! We form the Second line, behind the troops of "dorobanti" of Major Sontu. Don't shoot. Don't stop, until you reach the foundations of the fortification. It is prohibited the take care of the wounded! For that role, the crew of First Aid Workers which will come from behind! Once you reached the Fortification, fix the stairs on his walls! And climb as fast as you can, one after the other! When above, you open fire, and start a bayonet attack! Now you will receive the lunch, and also bread with cheese for 2 days! You will keep the food and ammunition in your bags! At ease! You will take your bagpacks with you! But once you entered the fortification you leave them, and enter in a fire position! The Turks can counter attack in every moment! Don't forget to take water with you! Do not eat so much, lad. Keep in mind, the food must last for 2 days! Where is the Special Division? Here! At your orders! At 3:25, the trumpeters must call the attack! We are on the 3rd line, so we have to take the fortification under a Bayonet attack... Any question? No, colonel! Tell your men not to take care of the wounded, and don't stop until the fortification! Understood! ATTENTION! Is it clear!? Yes! At ease! Ah, it was far better if we would have seen the place before... This way we'll go like blind men, and the Turks can freely fire at us.. They say that the Fortification is up the hill...Hmm.. So straight ahead... And you, why don't you eat? An officer told me that it is not good to eat before a battle. Well Ciuca, you are not a fool. By Grandfather told me the same when I saw little. He said that you should not have your guts full of food, in case if a bullet or sword strikes you.. Then I will be bad... Well, it would be bad anyway.. What did you do!? Did you eat everything!? I was hungry... Do you want a little? Attention! What happened? Who started the fight? I was informed that General Scobelev started the fight against the Fort of Crisina. The Russian Generals, Krugner and Krilov, repelled a enemy attack in the Area Lovcea and Radiscevo. What is the time? 13:10 General! Send a telegram to the Western Command and ask about the situation. The Prince will be furious, the attack was scheduled at 15:00... Scobelev is one of the most Bravest Generals I ever met. But the ignoring of tactics and military data can turn this battle against us He supposed to carry on the main attack for today, having in his command more than 12.000 Solders. And together with Meritinsky, his duty is to envelop all the Forts, which cuts the Roads to Iorhania. And after to unite with the right wing made by Russian-Romanian cavalry. A Telegram General sir! Scobelev ask our aid... His soldiers are under the fortress walls.. But we are too far... we can do nothing about it... Gentlemen, return to your positions. And I ask you to strictly respect the attack order received! What? His Highness Carol orders General Grilov to send 2 Battalions to aid Scobelev Your highness! General Scobelev received new Help and again attacks the fortress of Grisina! What time is it? 14:45. I do not understand why Scobelev attacks alone on the left wing, and not on the entire front... Well, that means that the main attack is elsewhere... Only a solution remains, the main attack will be in the centre, in the direction of Grivita Village, Where the Romanian and the Russian 9th army can be found.. Send reinforcements at the Forts of Grivita 1 and 2! And between the 2 fronts, a new Army corp must be formed, capable of any counter attack! It is said that General Scobelev is not getting along with General Meritinsky, his Commander in this very Moment.. Sadly, also we are not short of such situations.. Can we detach troops from the Southern Wing, your highness? Normally after the intense artillery preparations the attack itself should have been started on the entire front line.. Morning at 8 or 9 a clock... Once the attack started, should have been focused on a main direction, Thus myself, I would have tried trough this, to break Plevna from Sofia.. But it seems...that our enemies, have another plan... Hey, Trumpeter! Yes, sub-lieutenant.. You look like a smart lad, right? Why dont you answer? Yes, I am a smart lad, junior Lieutenant sir.. Good, see.. Look what I want to say is... you know why I wear glasses, right? It is because I can not see so well...yes? We will attack.. I will be forward and you right behind me..understood? And you must sound the attack as much as you can, clear? Clear, sub-lieutenant! See... You are behind and look at the Turks, if you see anyone that wants to move to us, or shoot to us, then you must shout, left or right, or in front, wherever the danger is. Look! If there is one there, how do you shout? Watch Left, Junior Lieutenant sir! Ahh, no SubLieutenant, fast so that they can't kill us! Short! Left, right, front! Clear!? Clear... Good. You boy, come here. You boy, come here. You stay here with the horse. Yes Major! Execute the order! ATTACK! FORWARD! Transmit this to the General Quarters, 30 of August, 1877, 15:00! The first Brigade of the 3 division, started their attack at the Fortress Grivita. TAKE COVER! QUICK! DOWN! COME ON LADS, FORWARD! STOP! AFTER ME! AFTER ME LADS, QUICK! Here, I am Here. Major Sir...what can we do? the map was wrong... We must attack! Trumpeter, sound the attack! FORWARD! AFTER ME LADS! FORWARD! FORWARD! Call the Attack, Trumpeter... But It is Slaughter SubLieutenant... CALL THE ATTACK! CALL THE ATTACK! AFTER ME! The Artillery should increase his barrage. Understood. Colonel, sir, I report from Major Sontu, The Terrain took the Battalion by Surprise! We lost half of our combat strength ..we continue the attack.. WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THE RIGTH FLANK!? Why is late Colonel Gramon!? Attack at once! The time please...3:20... It seems like a year passed since the attack... Attention! Stop! It seems like gun fire at the left Flank... What shall we do then? We stand here. RETREAT IN ORDER! FALL BACK IN ORDER! BACK! Those are our trumpeters. You lad, Come here! You go until you find the battlefield, and then you return to report! Understood Sir! Major Sir, we are exposed from the left, what shall we do? IT CAN NOT BE NEAGU! IT CAN NOT BE! The Attack was carried simultaneously by all! Only if...we started too early.. FOWARD LADS. FORWARD! Where is the Second Brigade, for the love of God!? Why aren't they coming? I'll go search for them Capitan! Go and look! Hey, Lad, Sound the Attack! Let the pagans believe that others will come! My glasses! Give my my glasses! Throw that damn pistol away you. Can't you see that you have no bullets anymore!? Wipe your eyes... Capitan sir, we remained alone... The Turks are slaughtering us.. Stretcher barer! Colonel sir, allow me to report. The right wing is exposed, the Russian Army did not go into Battle.. Stop the Troops and inform the Division! Colonel Gramond, announces that the entire 2nd Brigade was stopped under a slope, From a enemy artillery barrage, which can not be crossed. The connection with the 1nd Brigade was lost... The right wing is exposed... What the hell are Sontu and Maracineanu doing!? Why don't they get in touch with us!? What do you know of Maldarescu? He stopped right before the slope, he awaits your decision... Take connection with General Rodinov! If on the left wing, the First Brigade could not carry on the attack, then Gramond should carry it on. Maldarescu will manage alone... Colonel sir! The first brigade of the 5th division Russian claim that they did not start the attack, Because the hour of the attack, has not been claimed by the Brigade Commander, General Rodinov.. Time..? 15:30! Cover me! Forward! Move the stairs! We have no more munitions, Captain... I think that the Second Brigade shall soon arrive... Hey, lad, what is going on... It is a bloodbath, colonel Sir...Great disaster.. Help him. Hey lads, who want to go scouting? Me, me, me... Come to me... Give me the flag! ATTACK! FORWARD! TRUMPETER! SOUND THE RETREAT! TRUMPETER! CIUCA! TRUMPETER! WHAT ARE YOU DOING!? SOUND THE RETREAT! The retreat is sounded colonel... Trumpeters, call the retreat... Time? 15:40 Colonel sir... In 40 minutes, we lost the battle... Your highness! The fortress Grivita 2 Communicate: All attacks responded, we counter-attack with bayonets! Fortress Grivita 1, repelled the enemy attack, we have no major losses! Fortress Grisina, the Russians are attacking for the 4th time, we have high losses, send reinforcements. The battle stands in our Favour... Send 2 Battalions to Grisina against Scobelev, and put the troops in Vidin on state of alarm! If the two Grivita Forts will resist, then... at night we will counter-attack! And tomorrow, we will throw all our enemies across the Danube! It is 16:30.. This was the Second attack repelled... We have more than 1500 men put out of action.. And from the Third Division, the news are very bad.. General sir, we are informed that the 3 Russian Battalions, designated for this attack, stand now at our disposal. If we had the first Battalion from 16 Dorobanti, we have all the chances to take the Fortress.. At the left flank, the Russian have at least the same losses like us... I spoke personally with Prince Battenberg... Nevertheless, Grivita must be taken! Major sir! Look in that Direction, the Turks seem to be counter attacking! Soldiers, load your weapons and fire in the direction of the thistles field! DOWN! Sub Lieutenant. Look, we entered into another area. Those dead are not from our division... Indeed, we did not have any chasers in the Second Battalion.. Indeed, we did not. In front there should be our Troops! Come on lads, we shall carry on, come on! HOLD YOUR FIRE! HOLD YOUR FIRE! Those are our troops! Lieutenant sir, those are from the Special Division... Indeed, they are the Special Division, I know them from their field hats... Come on faster lads... Well look at them, from were did you came from, you Special Division huh? From a great Wedding, can't you see? Were is the Bride then? How are you sir? We are the Special Detachment, we attacked together with the 10th Dorobanti Regiment, the third Division... And why did you retire..? We were beaten down, Major sir... And how far did you advance in battle? Right under the fortress walls... I know them, Major, they are the lads of the First Brigade of the third Division.. Lieutenant sir, do you know anything from Capitan Valter Maracineanu..? He fell right under the the Fortress walls, Major... And Major Sontu...? Sontu too, among all the Officers of the First battalion, 10th Regiment Dorobanti, and the First Battalion, from the 8th Line Regiment... Only you escaped..? Sergeant? At your orders sir! Why did you not respect the Orders which dictated that all the wounded are to be left on the field, for the stretcher bearers and nurses to take care for? The Turks attacked with bayonets Major, we could not let them on their hands! I gave the order for them to be taken, Major sir! It is 10 minutes to 17:00... At 17:00 you give the order to the trumpeter, to sound the regrouping call. Until then you will recover what is left from your unit. Understood, Major.. What?...We will go once again...? Shut up! Ehhh, a pretty darn one.. And Penes..., where is he? He was at the Fortress dear Stan, and he went for help. He might got lost.., as many did... So I hope too.. Those white caps, are too good for a target... Hey, change the Cap.. Yes, like that.. Who was the one which created the battle maps and made the recognisance of the Romanian Army? Captain Rahovan, your highness.. Send him in the first line of battle! What losses do we have? At the moment the numbers are not exact, but approximately 50 Officers, and more than 2000 Soldiers from the Forth Division... And I have no reports from the third Division... A Communication from the High Command. General Scobelev took the Second Fortress at Crisina. That is the first good news we had today... Send my Congratulations to General Scobelev, and tell him to remain on his positions at any costs! Your highness, please do not expose yourself here, Osman Pasa can go in any time for a Counter-attack. We will resist. There is only one way, to deny Osman Pasa any counter-attack, and that is to attack and to take the fortress, do you believe it is possible? I do not know, your highness.. I send them three times in this crazy attack... When it would be so simple if we... We will talk using the Conditional, when we will write our memories, General.. I let you convince the soldiers to go at it once again... And thus, I think that before 18:00 we can start this attack, so that the night can not catch us... Order General Kruitler the restart of the attack in 10 minutes... What Regiments will attack today? The rest of the 10th, 13th and 14th Dorobanti, 5, 8 of Line, and the Second Regiment of Mountain Hunters. Order that this evening, the supper shall be served warm at the taken Fortresses. I wish you success. Be careful! Hey lads, somebody is moving under here. Brothers, I taught that I was in hell. I am from the 10th Dorobanti, third Division. Where are my Comrades..? Go there. Dorobant! Hey Dorobant!... well, come on lads.. This is Penes! PENES! This is Penes indeed! Are you well brother? Where did you end up? I was just "takirg" a walk... Those are the 13th Dorobanti? Yes, they are... Oh...again next to those unlucky ones... We will attack again! And this time, until the middle of the Fortress itself! I even put a bet, with the Major Candianu Popescu, that we will be the first inside the fortress, before the Mountain Huntsmen! This time the fortress will fall for sure, And I promise you that you will be the first which will enter it! While attacking, you only go forward, and follow me! BATTERY FIRE! What's happening, lads... It seems to me you were at the 3rd Division? We were,General sir! But in Retreat we got here. And the Major thinks that we hidden ourselves from battle and now, he will send us forward, because he says that we know the way better... And we start once again... But you should know that this is the another Fortress, even if everyone talks about only one... Indeed, Sergeant, this is another Fortress, but sadly we found out too late... And what happened to you "Turkey"? It looks like you crawled your way from deep underground. He was buried by a shell, General! I was at the Gates of Heaven, General sir. But they had no free places there, and so I came back.. Good, lads! Will we arrive it the evening inside the Fortress? We will, General sir! The morale is great! Now it all depends of you, leave no free gaps. And do not stop the attack under any circumstances Those are Russian trumpets... This time General Krutner is in a hurry... You start, too! Miss...miss! Please do not expose yourself to danger! Miss... Penes, Ciuca! The others are overtaking us... Do you see those spots there? There, the stairs must be placed. Trumpeter, sound the attack! Ciuca! Ciuca! Sound the attack! Take care of it! Understood!? I can not see anything... General sir, report: Fortress Grivita has fallen! You earned it! For such good news! Send a telegram about our victory to his Majesty! Understood! Can you still run? Like a rabbit, General sir! The Regiment Commanders, shall communicate to me about all the remaining forces! And that, measures against a Counter-attack shall be taken! Is it clear? Clear, General sir! In 40 minutes, the Forth Division, saved the honour of the Romanian army! Hey Dorobanti, look, look! Do you even have something like this? What is it written on it, brothers? See Ciuca, see? Let's go, that smoke is choking me... Ciuca, I will not give up until I capture a flag... to bring home with me at Vaslui... I lost my glasses... I have your glasses sub- lieutenant..look... Aaa, good lad you are... Did you see this flag? If you allow me, colonel, I will take this Captured flag to present it to our Ruler.. I agree Major, but take also the ones who have captured it... Of course "mon cher", of course! Sub lieutenant Hartel? Yes, it is me! A letter for you. Thank you! Sergeant Zacheu... Can't you hear, sergeant!? Sergeant sir...Sergeant sir.. BATTERY FIR...What the Hell do you want!? Junior lieutenant. What does he want again.. Sargeant, attach the horses, we change positions! Understood! Order a counter-attack at Grisina and on the Green Hills! If the surprise attack works, and Grisina is taken, then you shall open artillery fire at Fortress Grivita and take it back! Connect with Instambul, and request approval and aid for a General attack! If General Scobelev is defeated, then our troops will be early morning at Bogot. The reconquest of Grivita will give us a moral boost, and even a deciding one. I order you, attack and recapture Grivita! Gentlemen! In the Fortress will remain the 13th Dorobanti and the 2nd batallion of the 14th Dorobanti regiment. What shall we do, Major sir? Radovici...you are not mentioned in the orders, And so...you shall stay around here until you'll get new orders... Understood. Hey, look who comes! Ah, you again!? Don't tell me you are with the 13th Dorobanti.. Exactly so, sergeant! It is a cursed day Lieutenant, I will go from here, they are ill fated, once we escaped, but the second time we will go to hell... Lieutenant, let's... SERGEANT! Take care of the horses and place the Artillery in firing positions! Understood! Execute. I am tired brother Ion... Then go, take a rest... The trumpeters don't sleep, they must take guard duty of the fortifications. Let him, lieutenant, I will go in his place... Then go. That's all we need... Here gathered all the unlucky ones... We were here transferred, I didn't know that I will see you again... I am pleased to see you, Miss Maria.. General. General. What it is, boy? A telegram. Please read it. To General Cernat, the Ottomans went in counter offensive at the Eastern front taking the Fortress Crisina. The Detachment of General Scobelev is forced to retreat. Keep at any cost the Fortress of Grivita- Carol. Time? 3: 05.. And what brings you here Mihai? It is night, right? And during the night the Reserve Commander, has the right to do what he pleases.. Yes, and not. General! The Fortress of Grivita has been retaken by the Turks, and our troops are counter-attacking! My soldiers are rested and eager to fight. I can send at once few battalions to aid them... No Mihai! First, your men are too far away, second, they have another role... In that fortress, we have the best troops. They will take it back, I am sure. I want at every half hour trough a courier, a connection with the fortress! Understood! Will you drink a coffee? Hmm...can someone look were my daughter is, I have for her some clean clothes and some food. At once, Colonel sir! Thank you. You had a hard day... 53 Officers our of action and more than 2000 fallen soldiers.. And our allies have almost the same number... May I? Yes, speak! Miss Maria Cherchez was detached since last night at the Fortress of Grivita. For honours, present Arms! Soldiers, in the battle of 30 August, you proved that your ancient roots, still honor the Romanian soldiers! Under the greatest enemy fire, you have fight death with bravery! The Nation will be grateful for your commitment and self sacrifice! And I am proud of you, and I thank you! Among you, I mourn the Comrades fallen on the field of Battle. But the blood spilled, will not be in vain! From it, the independence and greatness of our Nation will be born! His highness, Emperor of Russia, Alexander the Second, express his happiness regarding your success! And to prove that, he ordered 150 Medals Saint George, to be given. The same number as the Russian Units which fought with you! For your devotion and self sacrifice the ruler of the country honours the Banner of the 13th Dorobanti with the order " Romanian Star"! How old are you boy? 19, Colonel! Eh, look at you Specials, were a tough battle is, there you are! We only serve our duty, General sir! Lieutenant Radiovici, what looses do you have? Half of my men, General sir. You will retreat today and present yourself to the Commanding post for new orders! Understood sir. Good job, trumpeter... It is indeed a beauty... but it was better if they gave us some land instead... If we are to wait for the Boyards to give us land, then we will wait a good while... Quiet soldier, do not talk! Your Imperial Majesty. In this council many Russian generals expressed the opinion, that the Imperial Army suffered great losses and thus, the siege of Plevna must be lifted And for the entire Imperial Army to Retreat in Romania, and to stay out the whole winter, to regroup itself. And in the spring to start the war with biggest forces... I must confess that I am fully against such opinions. I am convinced that the fate of this war, is decided Here, in front of Plevna! Where the biggest and Best Ottoman army can be found, composta da 50.000 soldiers and commanded by their greatest Commander, Osman Pasa. For us to retreat from the positions taken with so many Sacrifices, will mean a true tragedy.. Our troops are tired, we have no aid for the wounded and it will be a very harsh winter. If Suleiman will attack us with his troops... if the Ottoman Troops from Vidin will cut us the way to Danube, then everything will be a disaster.. I am surprised that the War Minister, oppose the decisions of the Major Russian State.. If the Turks would attack us now, with all their Forces only few could cross the Danube anyway. Your excellency, who knows in what Situation the Turks are Finding themselves.. I would like, to also know the Opinion of General Cernat. Your Imperial Majesty. Even if the same losses ca be found in the Romanian Troops. I agree wih the Siege of Plevna, and for its blockade! It is beyond any point, to believe ourselves defeated, before even the Enemy believe the same.. I thank you for your sincerity General. An army in the trenches, an army which do not attack or retreat is an army that looses his own personality! In my opinion, your Majesty, I am either for a General attack or for a full retreat across the Danube! Allow me...No! I would like to find the opinion of the Romanian Ruler. My own opinion and the opinions of my Officers, are the same with the one of General Milutin. I insist for the reinforcing of the actual positions. And I am convinced that Osman will try the breaking of the blockade. And thus, the risk of a final attack, will be of the Ottomans.. In fact, the Russian Army in Crimea, proven this way of Battle. Maybe we will need the Old Tottleben too.. And why not..? A Retired General... A retired General that the whole Europe appreciates... We see also today the proof... I follow your advice and I retired him... I accept the Solution proposed by of the Romanian Ruler, and my War minister General Milutin! General Tottleben will be called from Russia, and it will occupy the Function of Aid of the Western Command. And then General Zotov, will take Command of the Forth Russian Army. Is it fresh? No, but it is good, do you want some? Here.. Volunteer? Me too. From where are you? From across the Mountains, from Transylvania! Aaa, I know a little, I was there once with my brother with the sheeps But... were are you from? I am from Jiu, from Hobita. How old are you? Why...? Well, you have no moustache yet... But I have the Medal... Gentlemen, even if I expressed my disapproval about a new attack the Commander of he Forth Division, General Anghelescu and His chief of Staff, Lieutenant-Colonel Sergiu Voinescu requested a fresh attack on Grivita 2. And his Highness approved this attack for tomorrow, 7 October.. You know my opinion.. Tomorrow at 13:30, you'll start the Assault for which you are directly responsible, general.. I wish you success... The talk is futile, General sir.. Tomorrow...the deeds will talk instead. We will attack at 18:30.. With no artillery preparations.. And without the trumpeters signals. I am sure that we will take the Turks by surprise... More than 1200 Soldiers lost and 25 Officers... This is the result of a sad day, in which the Romanian peasant, this brave soldier! has proven his courage and self sacrifice, in a battle in which we.. send him to a certain death... Through the High Orders of Today Nr 63, The Reserve division received the name "Second Infantry Division of the Romanian Army of operations," under the Command of Colonel Mihai Cherchez.. General Anghelescu, the Commander of the Forth Infantry Division, and Lieutenant Colonel Sergiu Voinescu are dismissed! And in their place will be named General Dimitrie Racovita and Colonel Emanuil Boteanu. The high Romanian quarters, decided to create the Detachment of Ischer under the command of Colonel George Slaniceanu. And another bad news... 8.000 Soldiers under the Command of Ahmed Pasa, and 2000 Wagons with Provisions and Munitions sneaked in Plevna under the eyes of the mixed Cavalry Core... UNDER THE EYES OF THE COLONEL VICTOR CHRITEANU HERE PRESENT! I requested repeated times to the General... IN WAR THERE ARE ONLY DEAD, DEFEATS AND VICTORIES! THAT'S ALL! There are no places for excuses! You will support the consequences... Finally...Osman accepted a 3 hour armistice... The dead fallen 10 meters from the walls, will be buried at the place no matter the nationality! This night, our civilian convoys, can enter the camp of Bucov. Mita! Mita...Ion. Ion... What is wrong, boy..? Nothing... It is not allowed to cross through here, Lieutenant! Why? There is a quarantine order for delousing. I will go to the Medical tent... Fine, go that way. Do you want anything, Sub-Lieutenant? No...I just came to see you.. How are you doing..? Fine... Look, old Man! Do you recognize him still? It is good that I found you dear! Bless you father. Your mother, Florica sends trough me something to eat. Some meat, some cheese... Thank you, dad.. Mita... What is wrong with you lad, why are you so sad...? I know nothing from my wife, Major... Don't you worry... You upset us so... to run like from home.. Like you've done something shameful... We are very upset...Your mother Florica and I, because you told us nothing... As if...we had something against you for you to come and defend our country, Romania. Father I...And until a received a letter from you we were so worried... Your Mother, Florica and I.. But..did you behave well? A Medal? Father, let me tell you! When we arrived, we were attacked by the Turks! And I, on the horse was put in task of defending the Artillery. And suddenly, guess what... A Turk approached me... a very tall one, father! Like Mister Pop, the one from our village! And I aim at him.. Shoot.. but I could not hit him.. Maybe you hurried...Maybe.. But I don't know. And then, took the sword of a cavalry man! Ohh Mister...good that you came at last.. so that he could tell his stories to some one, because he drove us mad.. Let me tell you.. That Turk was very weak if you could cut him with this blunt sword.. Old man..I think we won't let you go home... we will enlist you volunteer! But I have no intention to leave! Here I am, here I will remain! At the day of 21 October, at 9:00, an armistice was acceped by the both sides. From humanitarian reasons, this armistice was accepted for the burying of the death and the taking care of the wounded, between the 2 Front lines. The Armistice Duration: 3 Hours. Up, Down! Up, Down! Up, down! Up, down! Up, down! What did they do? Up, down! What did they do? Up! They did not want to bury the death, Down! Didn't want, huh? Hey Trumpeter, be careful to not loose your Pants! Up, Down! Up, down! Mita! Mita! Look how came! Why are you standing like that, go to her, I will take the Guard Duty! Here... I brought you some food.. Are you well? Yes...thanks for asking..And you? What happened to you? Nothing...just a scrach... Did it hurt? Just a little.. And home...? everything is good.. Oh you came to see your man, very good! Even in his sleep he talks about you... But why are you sitting here? Come in my tent here. You can talk here quietly.. Sergeant, be careful that no one disturb them, understood? Yes, major sir! Good.. Look at what I brought you... And weren't you scared to make such a long journey..alone? No.. I missed you.. And home, everything is good? Did the cow give birth? Tell me more, tell me of everybody... Everybody are well. And you... I am well, too... But why are you not eating...? I will.. But why are you not eating...? I will.. Why didm't you put someone to write me...? I wanted no one to know what is in my soul.. You know...I started learning, how to write and read.. Oh good...for this you have time here, at war!? A Sergeant is learning us that.. We call him Penes. But I mix the letters up sometime... And you will write to me? I will... Good job old man! This is the most polished cannon we have! Indeed... What did you think I did so far? Here I leave you my revolver... I must go to the Valley... My child is there... Yes, I know... The Civilians are asked to leave the Camp! All the Civilians are asked to leave the Camp! But stay longer please... Eh, my dears, your meeting came to a end.. And you dear wife, get ready to leave, all the Civilians must... And tell the entire people that we are proud of your husband! A true hero! Why are you kissing my hand, girl!? I am not a priest!

Don't worry sergeant, I will take care of her... What is it? An order of the General quarters. To the Artillery Batteries from Calafat and Bechet. Open fire at Vidin without interruption, for not allowing the enemy to send new reinforcements in Rachova. My opinion is to delay the attack, due to this fog we risk too much... I agree, but I do it with sadness my dear... Announce the Commanders of the both attack lines, that the attack hour has been changed for 9:00. Understood! Do we have a connection with General Maindorf? Yes, colonel sir! Transmit: General, we ask you to delay the attack of the West of Rachova for 9:00. Capitan Rachovani... I apologise my dear, but a order is a order.. To the first battle line... Hey, you soldier! Stop! Aaaa you frog! You are Ciuca the trumpeter... It is me, sergeant sir...I lost myself from my own, didn't you see them? The Specials are here at Rachova? Didn't I tell you?... Lieutenant sir. Lieutenant sir! What is wrong, sergeant? Lieutenant sir, please give us the order to move out, I crossed again this shit of Trumpeter... And the Specials are here too.. Better take care of the cannons, Sergeant! Lieutenant sir, we must leave, it will be a great disaster, God forgive... It's good that the rain stopped... What can we do, sub lieutenant... we have our guts empty... It is better so...better... It is better, so that you can raise faster to the heavens.. God forbid! Will it be hard, Junior Lieutenant sir? A piece of cake... We attack on fog, Major sir? If it will be not revoked, we will attack at 9:00. Forward we have a shore... left and right surrounded by trenches.. here we will meet.. We continue the attack at the sounds of the trumpets. How are you, lads? We only stare, lieutenant sir... Were is your brother? He is sick, at the infirmary... With what? Oh, he has fever.. Look, there is Ciuca! What is with you here!? What is Brother Ion..I came with you here, because I was lonely without you all.. Get out of here...GO HOME! Let Ciuca come with us... Today it will not be that hard! Ciuca, come here you.

An order is an order, Capitan... Why do you drag yourself after me huh? Are you scared of battle, or do you have a moment of weakness, Mister Rachovani..? I will shoot you, you bandit! A enemy bullet, Major sir... Get back to your company, Soldier.. Major Giurascu seemed to be a determined man, a man for the first line. The attack of today depends on the first line determination.. Colonel sir, an attack on fog, it's a blind one... Especially when we do not know the terrain.. Maldarascu, do you know why Grivita has never been taken? Because all our attacks have been in the afternoon, and we haven't any time to respond to counter-attacks and do manoeuvers to fool the enemy.. The fog...might be an advantage for our troops, to arrive near the walls of the fortress and not to be seen. But how can we attack a fortress that we can not even see? Let us wait another couple of hours, maybe then the fog will go away. It is time, sound the attack! Trumpeter! Sound the attack! Sound the attack! Forward! My dear, it is too late now, the die is cast. Forward! Forward lads, follow me! Forward! Follow me! Brother...keep on me! Forward lads, after me! Forward! What can we do? Here we can not stay too long. Let us, major. I will come with you! Fire at a longer distance! I hope we will not hit our men, major.. Battery, fire! Your Highness! The Fortress in front of Rachova have been attacked by the Romanians! Rachova is a Fortress too powerful to be taken by the Dorobanti of Solniceanu.. Istambul announce us a Big Russian Offensive against Cars. The true battle is given here, at Plevna! Communicate to Rahova, resistance with any costs! Here you can see our Forces in front of Rachova. Cannons to fire positions! Faster! Report! Major Giurescu has fallen! The 4th Dorobanti Battalion has left with no Officers! Are the Specials in the Fortress? Yes Colonel Sir! Then the Battalion Command shall be taken by Lieutenant Bordeanu. He too, has fallen.. Then Major Ene shall take the Command of the 2 attack lines. At 17:00 I order the assault on the main Fortress. General Maindorf, at 17:00 you will attack Western Rachova. And you will not allow any Turkish Reinforcing Troops from Leaving Rachova. George, It is your turn now, At 17:00, you will attack with the entire Reserve. Please do not disappoint me.. Today you must enter in Rachova! My prestige is at stake... Colonel sir, the heroism of the troops can not replace the mistakes of their Commanders.. What do you want to say...? Our attack should have been coordinated also with the troops from Danube, where the Divisions of General Lupu awaits just a Signal... You, my friend are saying this...? When you know what General Lupu said about me...? I did not expect it! Lieutenant Colonel Mardarescu, execute the Order! The Dorobanti From the Regiment of Colonel Mardarescu are Attacking. Come on lads, we too! After me! Forward lads! Hooray! Be careful Junior Lieutenant! Be careful! Counter-attack the main fortress of the East! The retaking of it, is a necessity for the fights in front of Plevna! Take the command of the 2 Reserve Battalions, and start the assault! I understand, your highness.. Major sir... Major sir... Nita... Under my jacket, in my pocket... a letter for my wife... you must bring it to Bucharest... Brother Ion..? Brother Ion..? Brother Ion..? Penes...Penes...did you see my brother? No, no, I didn't see him... Stay here, I will go search for him! Brother Ion..? Brother Ion..? Ciuca! Ciuca! Brother...! Brother.. The rest of the 14 Detachment, regroup! Brother...Brother... Ioana... Brother Ion... What is wrong? Nothing... Take some water, drink please... like that... Ioana... I am dying... What will you do now...? Oh God... Why did I take you with me? Do not worry brother Ion, I wanted to come with you... Does it hurt...? I feel how the blood spills out of me... My leg Ioana...! My leg... Don't move, brother.. I don't move... Take positions at the walls. Save the ammunition! Nurse! What is going on...? Nurse! Nurse! Colonel sir...We have only 10 ammunition left for each Soldier... Take the ammunition from the dead, take the ones from the Turks and take their weapons... 2, take 2, you too, take 2! General Maindorf communicates, the Rachova West Fortress can not be taken. The First Dorobanti Battalion was pushed back... Major Stefan Mateiescu heroically fell on duty. The Command of the Regiment was taken by Capitan Constantin Merisescu. The troops fell back at the orders to the initial positions.. Communicate to Lieutenant Maldarescu to carry on the attack at the direction of Rachova.. At the main Fortress will remain only one Company of the 4th Dorobanti. Do we communicate something to General Lupu...? We didn't answer his question We will communicate the conquest Rachova... Until then..I beg some patience... ALLAHU AKBAR! ALLAHU AKBAR! The Turks are counter-attack Sub-lieutenant... Take me to the walls now.. ALLAHU AKBAR! Colonel sir, a new battle order, continue the attack to Rachova... Transmit to Colonel Slaniceanu... that our troops have been decimated... We can not carry the attack any more... And if the Turks counter-attack then, With a shortage of ammunition I am obliged to order the retreat... I request at once reinforcements, artillery and ammunition! Understood! Brother...who has any ammunition? Gentlemen, the situation is critical... Prepare the retreat... Trumpeter...sound the retreat... Understood lieutenant sir... Do not cry...hear? What is heard? Ours are sounding the retreat.. Leave...you must leave..! No, I will not, no, no! Brother... Oh you, crazy one. Don' cry anymore.. We attack? No, let them leave... Evacuate the wounded.. And take the corpses of the fallen officers... so that the Turks can not laugh and mess with them! The Turks... Ioana...do you remember what you promised me in the cemetery. you swore... Look...there, at the left are the mines of the Turks... Do you know how to light them? Do you? Are you scared? Yes...! You shall not... Come on, don't cry, do you hear...? Stop...what is this... Stop! Ciuca...This is our trumpeter... This is Ciuca...our Ciuca... This is Ciuca... Lieutenant...it is our Ciuca... Our Ciuca...CIUCA! CUCA...! This is our Ciuca! Calm down Penes... An impardonable mistake! At south of Danube, General Lupu awaited with a entire fresh Division a sign from Slaniceanu! And he!? Nothing! He attacks on his own, like we are in the Middle Ages! You know their relations... TO HELL WITH THEIR RELATIONS BETWEEN 2 DESK MILITARY STAFF! What are they thinking!? That the Romanian Soldiers are their servants-Slaves, on their own Lands!? I will ask our ruler to take them their commands... Tomorrow you'll give a free day to the entire Detachment.. And the day after, 9 November at 7:00, the attack must be restarted... FIRE! In 9 November, the Troops of General Lupu, coordinating his Actions with the ones of George Slaniceanu take Rachova, bringing a Victory that entirely belongs to the Romanian Army! What are you thinking about, you? At those that are no longer with us.. to be happy... Well I think that they are, and will be until the end, even after we win, and return home... Huh...what is it? We are done with Rachova! A telegram for you... Read it... At the Battles of Rachova... ..fell Heroically Elleonora Maria Cherchez... Alexandru... if you don't order me.. At Plevna I will enter the battle as a simple soldier...! It is time to go.. It is nearly sure that the action of penetrate the enemy, will be focused on the Road of Plevna-Sofia. Thus we will adopt the following operations plan: General Scobelev with the 2 Brigades which he commands, will aid General Ganesky. And the Command of my sector? It will be taken by General Silikov. General Kruitner, you will be reinforced by 3 Battalions of Rosiori from the 4th Sector. General Cernat, you take 4 Romanian Battalions from Berbita to support the 4th Division. Colonel Cherchez Sir...you with the 3th Division, must be ready at the right moment to occupy Plevna. Gentlemen! I am sure that you will execute all the tasks given, I wish you success. Your highness...The civilians went after us and blocked all roads... it is impossible to return to Plevna any more.. Install the Artillery batteries at once and open fire! Understood! ATTACK! AFTER ME! FORWARD! Back! Fall back! Colonel sir, we received Order From Osman Pasa, the Generalissimo of the Ottoman Forces to led you to his highness...I will follow you! I am Colonel Mihail Cristodulo Cherchez, from the Romanian Army. I know..I heard of you... And I wanted to present you personally my sword... And I will like to know all the conditions of the capitulation, Colonel... I am sorry your highness, but I have no information about it... General Ganetsky, his highness, wants to know the terms of capitulation.. Terms of Capitulation? It's a capitulation with no conditions! The sword of his Excellency... The Sword must be directly surrendered to the Supreme Commander! Until then, it will be in the possession of the officer that will accompany his excellency. Who do you propose for this mission, Colonel..? Colonel Grigore Polizu, the Commander of the 3rd Calarasi... What does he say? "The days come after one after another, some are happy, and some are not..." A old Turkish proverb, General... After the capitulation of Osman of 28 November, the war Council decides that the Russian Army must Continue the southern advancement across the Balkans with all the troops freed after the fall of Plevna. The Romanian troops received order to march to Vidin and received orders to attack the Ottoman units of west of Bulgaria. A Romanian division will escort the Turkish Prisoners at Plevna, and then it will occupy the left branch of Danube between Giurgiu and Calarasi. So, you agree to send a telegram to the Turkish Government. Romania is no longer in a state of war with the Ottoman Empire, and feels very happy about it. Thus I beg your Excellency to communicate me as soon as possible, the decisions which the Imperial Government wish to make, regarding the Repatriation of the 6000 Ottoman POW that we have in our nation. And which are free to return home when they desire. And we ask the same for the Romanian prisoners... General, we beg you for all measures to be made, for the Turkish prisoners to have all that is necessary. And that in the shortest time, the exchange to be made.

We come in front of you, after 8 hours of discussion. We believe that your Majesty shall respond to the Grand Duke with the best of Terms But with the relations of friendship and unity that ties you with the Romanov Family, ask the Great Duke a solution, so that the dignity of Romania would't be lower but contrary, a solition who would defend his interests.
