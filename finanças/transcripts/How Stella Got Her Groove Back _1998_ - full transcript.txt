No, Sidney. G.K.O.'s are Russian bonds. They guarantee you 65% interest on your money, their government's never defaulted on one, it's safe. It's a lock at 65% on your money. So if you want in for 10 million, do it. Michelle, get me Bill Moore, Skip Regent. I need 20 clients back to back to back. We have 35 minutes left. You're working the G.K.O? And, yes, Isaac, it's my day off. I'm late for an appointment which I can't break. Because, sweetheart, these funds are never available to individual investors except this one just opened with a 2-hour window of which there are... 34 minutes left. So speak up. Do you wanna be rich, or do you wanna wallow in regret? Whatever I'm taking, you make me work for it. Love to Emily. Stell, I'm in trouble, OK? I need you. Let me get with you at the end of the day. I may have blown off Peg Heinrich, and I can't wait for the end of the day. I'll be right in. Thanks. Bill Moore on 2. Theresa, confirm Sidney at 10 million, 65% due 2-28-99 at par. Yes, Miss Payne. Hello, Bill. Stella. How you doing? Feel like making some money? All right. I'm thinking about introducing Stella to one of Kennedy's golf buddies. He's a judge. Angela, you don't know what brand of men Stella likes. Neither does she, so be quiet. You need to mind your own business. And you can start by checking the want ads for a maid, and stop being so damn cheap. No one knows how to clean my house better than I do. The judge is very nice. Which means boring as hell. And you can tell him not to get his hopes up on Stella, 'cause our sister is stuck on stale. Right now, what other prospects does she have? None. How was the mud? We don't do mud. And in case you were wondering if we were talking about you behind your back, we were. Look, I'm here to relax because I stress enough at work. Besides, I thought you guys were my allies. We are, Stella, but when's the last time you had a decent date? Tell the truth. When was the last time you paid a bill on time? Now you tell the truth. She's got a point. Shut up, Angela, before I put a curse on you and them babies turn out looking like gerbils. Anything else, Cruella? Don't talk to me for the next 2 hours. You need a husband, and your son needs a father. Had one. Got rid of him. So glad I did. And the last time I checked, Walter was still Quincy's father, in case you've forgotten. You still need a man in your life. Look, Angela, just because Kennedy writes, produces, directs, and stars in all 3 acts of your drama, don't fool yourself. Every woman doesn't need that kind of guidance. You can be so defensive. It's really sad. Well, maybe if you'd have listened to mama instead of marrying the second guy you ever slept with... Why don't you just induce labor, so you can hurry up and have somebody you can boss around. Girl, I'm gonna get up from here right now. Don't let my water break. Hey, ladies, ladies! I am not feeling any love in this room at this time. Correct me if I'm wrong, Stella, but this is your treat, 'cause you know my money is too funny. Tsk. No, you didn't. No, you didn't. Wait, you don't even know us. Why you laughing? She's so fake. Look at her over there. Girl, you too many things. Keep up with me. Yeah. OK! OK, girls, let's have all the tickets here. And whatever you do, don't say anything about his weight. Mom, give me a break. Dad never reads labels. Calories or fat, cholesterol, sodium... That stuff means nothing to him. So, Mom, what you gonna do for 2 whole weeks without your loving son? Clean your room. Mom, no. Please don't go in my room. Don't touch anything, OK? I like it the way it is. But you can't find anything. I know where everything is. It may not look like it, but I do. What's it worth to you if I don't? Say, I'll be your best friend. Right. You already are, dude. But, you know, cash has always worked for me. Thank you, young man. What? What did you forget? I want you to try to have some fun while I'm gone, OK? Sure. No, I mean it. I know. That was such a great day. We had so much fun. And Sports Wrap is coming up next. We'll be back in a moment. Bored? Stressed out? Overworked? Then what you doin' sitting there when you know you need some sunlight? All it takes is one little phone call, and you're on your way to the most beautiful place on earth, where the water caresses you by day and sings you a lullaby at night. So come on, what you waiting for? Put down that work, girl. I said, "What you doin' sitting there", when you know you need some sun, Stella?" Hello? Yes, Stella. This is Judge Spencer Boyle. Your sister Angela gave me your number. Said you'd be expecting my call. Yes, Judge... so nice of you to call. I was hoping maybe we might... Why not? That gives me a lot of options. Delicious. That's very refreshing to find a young woman who doesn't start out playing hard to get. Yeah, that's me. I'm easy.. I only meant that no games is kind of refreshing. I hear you're an athlete. Maybe we could go run together sometime. I don't see why not. Well, this went well. Good-bye, Stella. Bye. Call your travel agent or 1-800-Jamaica. We'll be waiting for you. Hello, this is Eartha Kitt. Delilah's not home now, so leave her a message. Grrr. Delilah, where are you, girl? I got a brilliant idea. Let's go to Jamaica. Are you game or lame? Call me back, a.s.a.p. Hello, this is Eartha Kitt. Delilah's not home now so leave her a message. Grrr. Forget that last message. That was just a stupid one-minute fantasy. I don't have time to go to anybody's anywhere. I got too much on my plate. Sorry, girl. Call me? Hello? Bertha, I'm totally ignoring your second message. Start packing your shit. D. We are going to Jamaica, Miss Thing, and I don't wanna hear you tell me why you can't go, OK? I don't really think I can take the time. What are you talking about? You ain't been nowhere and done nothin' since I was a natural blonde. And it's only a week. Just ask them. I got a deadline with these shareholder reps. Well, let them share without you for once. Quincy's home baby-sitting his daddy, and you ain't got nothin' else to do. See, that's easy for you to say. They got tons of package trips from New York. But since it's so last minute, I gotta pay full fare. Look, don't even go there. Don't even go there. You being cheap, Stella. That's not like you. It's not even attractive, honey. Don't be cheap. 'Cause you make enough money to do this. And you're worth it. And even if you ain't, I am, so we going to Jamaica. I feel really privileged to have this opportunity to be in your presence. I have to tell you, though, I don't want you to get jealous 'cause I lost a couple of pounds. A couple. Yeah. Them Jamaican dudes are gonna be chasing me all over the island. You'll be picking up my sloppy seconds. I gotta go, girl. Good-bye. This isn't working. Can you get me some more penis material, baby, 'cause these boys are just... It's painful. Come on, share with your friend. Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the fasten seat belts sign for our arrival in Montego Bay, where as you know, the weather is always perfect. Welcome to Jamaica. Thank you. Welcome to Jamaica. Thank you. Hello. Hi. Stella Payne. Sign here, Miss Payne. Could you tell me which room Delilah Abraham is in? Sure. Ahaaah! Hey, girl! Hey, girl! I've been waiting in the bar for an hour and a half. Then where's my rum punch? You know I could use it. Well, come on, girl. You look so fly. Don't I? I know you think you're cute with your new braids. Yeah. You like 'em? I love 'em. They make you look entirely too damn young. Wait now, girl. I want you to wave to Jack and Buddy. I am not waving to men I don't know. You will. Now, they from Chicago by way of L.A. They got 3 Superbowl rings between them. I get Jack, and you get Buddy. No, you didn't. Yes, I did. I did not come all the way down here to turn into a slut. I did. A big old ho slut if I can. Look, all I wanna do is run, read, relax, and roll over. Lord. Not pick up old, soft football players. When was your last wide receiver? OK? OK? Come on. Bertha. What? I'm gonna get you. Welcome to Jamaica, ladies. Respect! Respect, child. Irie! Irie! You good, girl? I'm good. You're good? Yes. You real good? Don't scare the white people. What? This right here. Gimme! It's got my name all over it. Where's the bathing suit that goes with this? I know you better sit down and be glad I'll let it go for 50. Yeah, I got your 50. Gotta tell you, though, I'm glad to see you. You look good. That's 'cause you don't know good from spectacular. You look good yourself, girl. Yeah, I know I do. I think I got a little weak blood sugar or something. I been taking ginseng and sing-sing and hop-sing, trying to get some pep back in my step. It ain't hardly working. When was the last time you had a physical? Probably about a year ago. All I know is this... When I knock on your door in the morning, have your sneakers on, and be ready to run. Tss. You must be out your mind. I did not come down here to exercise. And do you think they could put a little more lycra in this thing? Girl. As your best friend for the last 22 years, can I have this? No. Can I at least see a picture of my godson? Now those you can have. Probably 'cause they're plastic. But ask me if I care. Do you care? Hell no! I look good in these. No. All right. This Is my favorite. Just gets the circulation going. All right. Go on now. Come on. Here we go. I'm running, girl, like the wind. Come on, D. You can do it. I'm doing it. Look at me run. All right. I'm fast like a mo-fo. Running. I'll see you at breakfast. D! That was great for me. I feel warmed up and everything. I feel like I could just have the whole day to myself. I'm bad. I'm so bad. I'm bad. I'm so bad. Good morning. Are... are you a rapper? No. Sorry. I... I don't rap. Lord have mercy. Why don't they come in this make and model in my age group? Excuse me. Are you dining alone? Why? Would you mind if I joined you? My plate looks lighter than yours, maybe I should come to your table. OK. There oughta be a law against being young and sexy. I'm sorry. What was that? I said, "Whatever it is, sure smells good." I think it's my cologne. It's new. No, I meant the food. Right. I meant the cologne. So, you're certainly the most colorful thing I seen this morning. What, do you have a problem with pink? Actually, yes. I'm in therapy for it. It was a joke. So are you enjoying your first morning here in Jamaica? Maybe I've been here for weeks. I would have noticed you. No, he doesn't call himself flirting. This is too cute. So... what's your name, young man? My name's Winston. Winston Shakespeare. And yours, young lady? My name's Stella, Winston. See, I gave you 2 names, you only gave me one. Well, the one I gave you was real, Mr. Shakespeare. You didn't know Shakespeare was really black? Yeah, man. Socrates, too. So... where's your husband? What makes you think I have one? OK, where's your boyfriend? You ask a lot of questions to be so young. Where are your parents? And how old are you? My parents are at home... Where they belong. And how old do you think I am? 25? Really? Well, I'll be 21 on my next birthday, so that makes me 20. He's not even legal. And you are? 40. No, truthfully. Let's not go there, OK? You look really, really good. I mean, I never seen a 40-year-old woman who looks like you. Thanks. So, what... what brings you here to Jamaica? I needed a vacation. What about you? Why are you here? I'm here staying with a friend of mine... who works at the resort. I just got my degree in biology, but I don't know what to do with it, so I'm here trying to land a summer job... possibly learn to be a chef. Winston, is it? Yes. That's nice. Wait... you haven't finished your breakfast yet. Yes, I have. OK... will you be going to the... the pajama disco tonight? The what? We wear our bed clothes and... we party. We dance. We have a good time. You can't be serious. No, come on now. I mean, it's your first night in Jamaica. And to be honest... I would like to dance with you. No. I don't think so. In case you haven't noticed, Winston, baby, I'm old enough to be your mother, OK? What? Nothing, I was just thinking about that. OK, so I'll meet you there at 10:00. Cool? I... I don't think so. Well, I'll be there, anyway, watching the door, hoping you change your mind. Nice meeting you, Winston. Buddy, Jack, this is my best friend Stella. Hey, Stella. Say, baby. Now, I heard you was down here on the island looking for some real love. If that rumor's true, I am here to put the "P" in paradise for you. Buddy, shut up and roll over. You... you t-tearing that bathing suit up, Miss Delilah. Ain't I, though? I do look good, don't I? Baby. All right, then do mama's footsies, 'cause they're aching. Listen, we going to Rick's Cafe tonight. They got the best lobster, the best sunsets on the island. What time you wanna go? You make sure you wear something that you can show off them beautiful brown shoulders of yours. Let me put a little sunblock on there. No, no, no. Thank you, Buddy. That's all right. Aw... And as far as tonight goes, I don't think so. What you talking about? You don't think so? It's our second night. Don't dud up on me now. I'm feeling tired, D. From what? S-s-s-s-s-s- s-swimming? I told you jogging wasn't gonna do you any good here on the island. All you got to do is take a nap. You got all day. Bring me back a doggy bag. Am I crazy? Did I miss something at breakfast? Yep. Waffles and red grapefruit. No, not that one. That's mama's heart shuttering. Give mama a heart attack, you don't get none. I'm funny. Look at how cute he is. The teeth. That's good. That's good. I know it's good. I'm gonna take him to the porn shop, OK? He don't even know what I'm talking 'bout. Yeah, that's good. I'm too old for this mess. I'm glad you came. But you're late. How can I be late to something I never said I was coming to? Well, I been waiting for you to walk through that door since a quarter to 10:00. It's a very pretty nightgown. Thanks. I feel a little overdressed. Don't. Why don't you wrap that thing around your waist? Yeah. Thanks. Heh heh heh. S-say, man, what the fuck's s-she doing with him? Hey! Hey! What are you doing? She's dancing with me. And who the hell are you? None of your business. Yes, it is my business, girl. We came here together, and then you ditch me to play with some juvenile hip-hopper! Who you know nothing about. And you do? She knows she likes me. Isn't that right? Yes, Winston, that's right. Come on, girl! No! No! I'm gonna... I want you to meet my friend Jack. Come on. I'm gonna see you later, girl! I'm gonna introduce her to Jack! Jack! Jack, where are you? Hey! Does everybody wanna get crazy? Take it off, children! Take it all the way off! I can't do this. OK, OK. This way. Unh! G-g-g-g-get down, man. Get down, man. Get down. You're hot, man. You're really, really hot. This is too much competition for me. Is it too much for you? My very thought. Buddy... you too hot for me. Hey! Hey, where you going, man! Come on back now! You only seen the half of it! Hey! Stella! Stella? Stella, open the door. I know you in there. I seen your little boyfriend downstairs sucking down burgers with his posse. Open the door. What do you want, slut? Who are you calling a slut? Trolling the kindergarten yards for a date. They gonna put your behind in jail for that. He's almost 21. Well, then it's almost not felony. What's his name? Winston. Winston. Yeah. You knew all day you was gonna see that boy tonight, didn't you? And Buddy Bear's poor heart is broken? It is. He is. He's a broken man because of you. But, honey, that boy is cute. Who, Mr. Jailbait hip-hopper? I watched him dance for about 2 hours. If he moves that good with his clothes on... And y'all make a cute couple. Girl, all I did was dance with him. All night long. So, is that a problem? Well, it must be, 'cause I'm here, and he ain't. Please. I just unpacked. That, and you're chickenshit. Come on. Don't be ridiculous. What in the world would I do with a 20-year-old kid. Fuck him. Do the humpty hump. Do the bumpty bump. Fuck him. Yeah! I'm old enough to be that boy's mama. That boy wasn't looking at you like you was old enough to be his mother, girl. Look, Stella, we in Jamaica, girl. We are in Jamaica. Have an affair. Have a fling. I'm not gonna tell if you don't. You need to get up and go to your room. I'm not going to my room. No! You know what? I'm going... I'm taking me and my big behind, and I'm laying down on the bed just like this. No, you ain't. Winnie. Winnie, Winnie, Winnie. Tsk. Move your butt over. And you better hush. I don't wanna hear... I'm not saying a word. "Winston." Oop. Sorry. I know he is fine, but. I ain't studding that child. Liar. Winston. Look. Watch her. Hey. Winston, do me a favor and talk to me, please. Don't look... What? But that old man coming this way is trying to hit on me. And who can blame him? You know, if I weren't in my right mind, I'd swear you were trying to hit on me, too. And you would be right. You're serious, aren't you? Very much so. So, what are you saying? That you would like to be intimate with me? Are you paying attention? OK. Y-y-you're not going to change your mind at the last minute, now, are you? No. I'm not going to change my mind, but I don't know what I'm doing, and I can't believe what I just said to you. I... this has got to be illegal, you think? Wait. Now, why would you say something like that? Boy, I'm old enough to be your... Why don't you just get it out of your system right now? Tell me 3 million times how old we both are. That way, I won't have to hear it again for the rest of our lives. Or for the rest of the week. Yeah. What makes you think you're going to last a week? I was just hoping. I'm sorry. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Excuse me. Gotcha. All right, so what you're telling me is that you don't really have a passion for medicine. No. I... I want to be a doctor. I do. My father is a surgeon. I'm sorry. I'm not sure what your meaning of passion is. I mean that your desire for it is that strong. I mean you'd rather do that more than anything else in the world. I feel that way about you. So, are you going to med school? I postponed medical school, and, needless to say, my father was a bit upset at first. Yes... but then he realized that it was your life, and he told you to take all the time you needed, right? How did you know that? Because my mama told me the same thing. I think it's in the parents' handbook... Let your children go and find their way. Yeah. My mama always thought that I'd be the one who'd make it out of the projects, make something of myself... Which pretty much came down to a lot of money, but I had other ideas. I wanted to make furniture, you know? Furniture? But in the end, I wound up just where she wanted me to... In the money markets. Tell me more about the furniture. You don't have to act interested in that. If I wasn't interested, then I wouldn't ask you. An idea would come to me in a dream... and I would jump up and run straight to the garage. Shoot. I think I was just about your age then. And I would sit, and I'd play in my pajamas until daylight. Sometimes you don't know what your life is going to turn out like... Not even when you plan it. You can't always plan everything. You can try. You don't make furniture anymore? No. Why? I make money instead. Hey. Hi. You look nice. Thank you. You're early. Yeah, well... I got hired at Windswept. Yeah, man. Assistant to the head chef. That's great. Well, that's what you came here for. So, when do you start? That's the thing. I start immediately. I have a meeting with the boss in about an hour, so I have to push off. I am really, really sorry. I thought I was going to spend all day and all night with you, but... Well, what time do you get off tonight? I have to work tonight and tomorrow, and I'm on call for the rest of the week. See, someone got fired, and then I got hired at the last minute. Look, Winston, it's been fun. And the next time I'm in Jamaica, and I want to play these high school games, I'll call you first. Stella, I want to see you before you leave. Why? Because I have to. Now, I get 2 hours free time each evening. 2 whole free hours? Wow. I mean, don't strain yourself, Winston. Let's just... Let's just say good-bye now. No. I can find time to see you before you leave. I know it. Please. Tsk. Serious? Yeah. OK. Yeah. OK. OK. You think you got played? Let's not go there. Isn't this beautiful? What you mean, let's not go there? You already there. Look at you, lip hanging down. You're pouting, which I ain't seen in 20 years. I am not pouting. I'm pissed. Outraged is more like it. Yeah, behind a 20-year-old kid. Would you feel better if he was 40? Well, at least I'd have some dignity. I wouldn't feel like some desperate old broad. I got to ask you one question. Was it good? Better than that. Return the man's phone calls. No. No. It's over. It was just one night. Return the man's phone calls. Listen, you are not fooling anybody, especially not me. God's here. Good morning, Castle Beach Hotel and Resort. May I help you? Hello? Yes, Winston Shakespeare, please? Winston! I'm sorry. He's not here. Do you expect him soon? I can't say. I can take a message if you like. No, that's OK. Thanks. Lord. Finally. Well, first of all, welcome back, slut. I'd say that was a pretty accurate description. Can I at least get into the house without coming home to the instant bullshit? Next trip. I'm sorry, but Miss FBI agent over here grilled me so long and hard, I had to tell her. Whatever. Can you at least help me with the bag? Well, I got some good news, and I got a little bit of bad news. What? It's not Quincy, is it? No. If it was Quincy, you were on the other side of the world partying, so what would you have done if it was? Hello, Angela. Plus, I hear you're a cradle robber, so you probably have a hard time keeping the children straight. Now, you didn't have to go there, Angela. Not at all. Whatever. No, then again... Girl, I love these braids. You look like a real hootchy mama. Don't say another word, Angela. Yeah. You'll be delivering in this driveway. Don't start with me. Well, anyway, before you get too pissed, they're about to cut off my cable and snatch back my Nordstrom's card if I don't pay, because you know Chantel's day-late daddy is late again with the check. So, basically, can I borrow about $300 until whenever? So, what's the good news? Did I say there was some good news? Yes. I'm still beautiful. Well, beautiful one, did you feed Phoenix and Chester, or are they dead? Don't worry. It's still Wild Kingdom up in there. But the bad news is, I had a little baby accident in your car, but it wasn't my fault, Stella! Stella, this woman came out of nowhere making a left turn out of the right lane. Can you believe that? Did anyone get hurt? No. Thank goodness. Why come you're not acting pissed? Vanessa, it's just a thing... a stupid car. It can be fixed. Wait a minute, Stella. That young boy must have put something on your ass. What happened to you? Nothing. Did you go down there and fall in love with a 20-year-old boy? Are you crazy? How could you stoop so low? And I want to know how low did you go? Look at you. You're glowing and shit. You know, you ain't got the sense God gave you. All I've got to say is thank God it was just a little fling, and you're not seeing him again. And you should be ashamed of yourself for being so desperate. You need to take your pregnant behind home right now, because you could spoil a wet dream. For your information, I'm not completely stupid, nor have I committed any crime. All I did was sleep with him. Damn! Yeah, and I want to hear all the juicy details blow-by-blow, but I gots to go, so call me in the car. Hi. Isaac, what's going on around here? Are we moving and no one bothered to tell me? I'm at a loss. Files are missing from my desk. I didn't authorize access. I can't log on to my computer. Has the system crashed? Talk to me. Sit down, Stella. I don't feel like sitting. Just tell me what's going on. Look, our numbers are down. We've had 3 rough quarters. The merger with Thorsen-Bendett... Jerry went for it. To avoid a redundancy at the upper levels, it's one of ours, one of theirs. Carl Amundsun has your spot, Stella. I know they plan to offer you an excellent package. You think I'd fall for that? I built this division. I made millions for this company. You think I'd accept some golden parachute and drop back into my hole? You've known me longer than that, Isaac. You tell them they'd better make it platinum! And even then, I may sue their sorry asses. I understand how you feel. I didn't want this, but what could I do? Nothing, I expect. Too busy making sure your spot didn't become one of theirs. Don't forget, I got over 3,000 in my bank savings if you need it. Thank you, baby, but mama put away a little something for a rainy day, so don't worry. Don't you feel bad about being fired? I'd be pissed. You'd be what? I'd sure be mad as hell. Quincy. Sorry, Mom. Remember how you felt when you didn't make the all-star team? Mom, don't go there. That's what losing my job feels like. Well, but things happen for a reason. We'll see. I understand. Well, I hope this makes you feel better. You always make me feel better. Grace. God is great, God is good, thank you for our food. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, did you have fun in Jamaica or what? I did indeed.. Here. Check these out. All the places I went to when I was there. Wow. Mom? Since you don't have a job now, think it's possible to take a family bonding vacation in Jamaica this summer instead of Africa? Quincy, now, we have to be sensible. We may not be broke, OK? But I gotta find a new job, deal with these lawyers. I have a lot on my plate right now. You understand? Yeah. Hello? Who's this? One moment, please. Mom. Yeah, what? Some guy named Winston, and he has an accent. Winston? Hello? Hello, Stella. Wow. What a nice surprise. How'd you get my number? Your friend Delilah gave it to me when I came to look for you. I, I wanted to say good-bye. She gave you my number? Yeah. She doesn't know you. How much you pay her? Everything I had, plus an IOU. I tried to call you, but you weren't there. I've been thinking about you. Really? No, you haven't. I miss you, Stella. No, you don't. Could you hold for a minute? Yeah. Hoo!! Hi. I'm back. So, when we just left off, you were getting into how much you missed me. I, I wrote you a letter, but I was a little afraid to send it. Fax it to me. I want to see you, Stella. Why don't you come to the point? Look, Winston, I really don't see how that's possible. Well, in 3 months, I can take a sick leave. Well, maybe I can arrange something. I did promise Quincy I'd bring him to Jamaica. Yes, Mom! How soon? Can Chantel come, too? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Let me think about it, and I'll call you back with the details. Stella, when you come, could you bring me some junk food? Junk food? Yeah. I need Snickers, Ho-Hos, Oreos, and the Cocoa Puffs. What are you gonna do for me? I'll think of something. You do that. All right, I'll call you back tonight. I can't wait. Bye. Bye-bye. Stella! Hey! Who's that guy with Auntie Stell? That's her new boyfriend she had to come all this way to find. She couldn't find one in America. He's also very young. How young is he? Not quite 30. That's not young. Sure is cute. Well, as you can see, he's already taken. Marco! Polo. Hey, you guys. I want you to meet someone. What do you say, Quincy? Hi. How you doin'? And you must be Chanel. It's Chantel. Hi. Excuse me, Chantel. Very nice to meet you. Well, Miss Stella Payne... Welcome back to Jamaica. Marco! Polo. Polo. Polo. Polo. Polo, polo, polo. Marco! Be careful, you guys. OK! Look sharp. Wow, this place is full. What can I get ya? A ting, please. A ting. And for you? Me want the same thing. Well, your son sure favors you a lot. He really takes after his daddy. No. He's grown so much since the last time I saw him. How long's that been? A year. Say about... His dad and I divorced 4 years ago. That's sad. But a lot of that's going around. Well, you sure look happy to see your mum. Yeah, man. Let me show you how happy I am. What's her problem? I don't know. Let's dance. Cool. Come on. I quit my job. You look like you're apologizing for it. Well, I don't want you to think that... that I'm frivolous. I tell you what. I quit mine, too. Yeah. Right after they fired me. What? Are you OK? Yes and no. I'm getting some good legal advice so I may even come out ahead. I'm not talking about the money. No? I mean, if my father couldn't practice medicine anymore, boy, the man would not know what to do with himself. It would be as if someone just took away his... his identity. So don't try and pretend like it's not a big deal because I know that it is. Well, I... I feel betrayed, if you want to know the truth. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't afford to just go crazy about it, could I? Yes, you can. I will do your worrying for you tonight... So hush. Yeah? Have you let that boy up for some air yet? Let me talk to him. I know he's buried up under there. Winnie, can you hear me, baby? Shut up. He's on a banana boat with the kids. What took you so long to return my call, Bertha? I could be down here losing my mind, and you wouldn't know it. How you doing? I've had better days, but I'm not gonna waste this very expensive phone call talking about me, Miss Thing. For a girl who lost her job, you sound awfully chipper. I must say, I love it, though. Yeah. I should be ashamed of myself down here acting like some lovesick college girl. We P.M.Sing now? No, we are not. Haven't you ever done something so crazy you had to keep it to yourself? Yeah, but I can't remember none of their names. I didn't used to be this crazy. I beg to differ with you, darling. Yeah, I just had to open my big mouth. "You want to be intimate with me?" Well, you opened it so wide, I saw you on Hard Copy. You looked good, though. Hush up, girl. I'm trying to be serious. Life is too short for us to be bullshitting ourselves. We've had this conversation 4 or 5 times now, and for the last time, I'm asking you, what is wrong with you liking this young man? D, he doesn't get it. He's just a kid, you know? He hasn't been anywhere, he hasn't done anything, he can't even buy me a drink. He don't know the first thing about... Hell, D, he hasn't even had his heart broken. And this morning I found Cocoa Puffs in the bed. Cocoa Puffs? Girl. Young and innovative. Yaah! I don't know whether I'm coming or going. Look, that's a good thing, 'cause it means you ain't gonna get bored. Know what I mean? You ain't gonna get bored. Now, if you are done with this week's episode of The Young, Restless, and Colored, I gotta go. I got folks waiting on me. Give my godson a big old kiss for me and take one for you, too. I love you, Stell. Yeah. You, too. Bye. OK. All right. Yeah. See those horses? Wow. This is beautiful. Yeah. Very spacious. Hey, man. It doesn't look like a restaurant. That's because it's my folks' place. Winston, you didn't tell me. I wanted It to be a surprise. I'll bet you did. I don't like surprises like this. Look at me. You look beautiful. Your mother's gonna think I look like a hooker. Relax, please. Hey. What's up? You look beautiful. Mummy, Daddy... I would like you to meet Stella. Hi. Stella, very nice to meet you. Thank you. Hungry? A little. And are those your teenagers? No... yes. My son's 11, and so's my niece. I'll go get them. Excuse me. Well, Stella... allow me to show you our home. OK. To ride the horse 'cause she's so wild. So, I'm gonna ride her. What happened? She threw me, of course. Why you laughing? I'll get it for you, ma'am. Can I help? No. The workers can handle it. On second thought, come in. Sit. OK. It's a lovely table. Thank you. I could beat around the bush, but it's not my style. So, how old are you, Stella? I'm 40. I'm 41. Are you American women so desperate these days that you can't find a man your own age? No. Then what could you possibly want with my baby? He's not a baby. He's my baby. And you should be ashamed of yourself. Hey. I have never been so humiliated in my life. Easy now... I think you're overreacting just a little? I mean, I can understand, you know. My mum can be a bit difficult at times... She called me desperate. Said I should be ashamed of myself. OK. Yeah. All right, I apologize. I mean, you know, that was out of line. I just wanted you to meet my family. What made you think I was ready to meet your parents? I wanted them to know how important you are to me. But you could have asked me how I felt about it. Did that occur to you? I thought you'd be proud to meet them. You know, it's not about your parents. It's about the immature way in which you handled it. "Immature way"? Now you're gonna scold me like some school child? You're behaving like one, wouldn't you say? You didn't think I act like such a child last night. Stop it. You know, this whole scene is getting on my nerves. Cool. No problem. I'll take you back to the hotel. I think we're finished here. I don't want to go swimming! Why not? I want to play soccer. Swimming's stupid. Whatever, man. Hey, Winston. Come on, we're gonna play soccer. No. Not right now. New York Hope. Yes, Dr. Steinberg, please. This is Dr. Steinberg. Yes. Stella Payne returning your call, although I'm not sure why you called me. Your friend Delilah Abraham had your name down as next of kin. What do you mean? Next of kin for what? Whenever there's a problem, we notify the closest relative. What kind of problem are you talking about? I'm sorry to have to tell you, but Ms. Abraham is facing a medical emergency. A what? During surgery this morning, we found Ms. Abraham's cancer had advanced to her liver. She's been in the hospital for the past 2 weeks. I thought you were aware of it. No. I... I wasn't. She told me she talked to you. I think if you're able to get here, you should come to New York right now. Yes. As soon as possible. Good-bye, Ms. Payne. What is it? Tell me what's going on. I'm waiting. 2 years ago when I got that big IRS refund check. Now, that's entirely too long for a girl to go without feeling the rush of a little shopping spree. So... Bergdorf's it is. What's my limit? Just keep in mind that I'm jobless. 5,000. You crazy. And you could use a pedicure. My balance at Bergdorf's is zero. Well, I'll work with that. OK. You know, your plants were petrified, and when was the last time you vacuumed? Girl, you know I had to fire that housekeeper. That bitch was eating me out of house and home. I'd get up there to the refrigerator, there's be nothing left but a dollop. I had to suck her ass outta there like a Hoover. That's what I called her. Miss Hoover, get the fuck out of my house. Hey. Turn that up, girl. Hey. What you trying to do, the skate? Whoop. Snuffy's going away party. You and Cooper going down the Soul Train line. Both of you, 10-inch afros, looking like you was having a seizure. And forgive me, but it was a hot pink polyester jump-suit that you were wearing, which I distinctly remember telling you was a bad fashion statement. I never wore a hot pink jump-suit in my life, bitch. Right. Well, I was right behind you in my sexy mini-skirt and silver lamé halter, but unfortunately, I was dancing with no-deodorant-wearing Johnny. Funky Johnny... to his friends. That was the same night that Cooper's ex-girlfriend snatched off Melanie's afro wig, and everybody started tossing it back and forth. What was her name? Cassandra, girl. Cassandra the ho. Cassandra the 360-degree ho. Child, you step on her foot, her legs open. Motherfuckers come tumbling out, people you ain't seen for years. Talking about, "Hey! Hey! I've been up here with Cassandra." I seen a Volkswagen come out of there. That's why Cooper left her for you, the Kama Sutra herself. The boy didn't leave her for me. Cooper left for cock-eyed Charly. Who? You remember... You remember him? Talk about, "Charly, put your glasses on." Child, he'd look you dead in the face and you know he was seeing 8 of you like The Fly. He was talking, "I don't need no glasses." I liked Charly. If he'd just keep his eyes shut. What? What? Give me a hit. Should I call the doctor? What's wrong? Why you shaking? I'm not. It's just cold in here. It's my breath, ain't it? I smell bad, child. No, you don't. I smell like Funky Johnny. Nobody would tell him. I told him. What? You did? What did you tell him? "You stink, motherfucker." Did it hurt his feelings? He was mad. He was mad. I love you, girl. I love you, too. I'm scared. Yeah. Me, too. Want to do me a favor? Anything. You name it. Sing to me. Sing what? I don't know. Don't matter. Come on. Gimme your hand. I'll hold your hand. Just gonna sleep. And now, we'll have a few closing remarks from Delilah's dear friend Ms. Stella Payne. D would tell me to make it quick, don't get all mushy on her, so I'll try. I guess it really shouldn't matter that she didn't tell me right off that she was sick. That I'm mad at you, D, for finally doing what you've never been able to do... keep a secret. Who's gonna be my best friend now is what I want to know. We had 20 whole years behind us. That's a long time to love somebody. I hope you like it up there, D. Look for my mama. She'll be near a bid whist game or cooking greens and ham hocks. I hope you guys are half as blessed as I was to have a friend as... cool... as funny... as smart... and as crazy as she. Life is but a dream. Look! What are you doing here? I came to check up on your mum. She's kind of sad right now. I'm surprised you came. Thank you for coming. So... I hate packing, but I guess I should get upstairs. The kids have to get back. I have to get on with my life, whatever that is. I love you. Dealing with this buyout, looking for a new job. I love you, Stella. No, you don't. You couldn't. Yes, I do. Very much. Winston, we haven't talked about your plans. What are you going... What time does our plane leave? 10:15. OK. Tell your mama we're tired. I'll call her tomorrow. Quincy, please hurry up. OK, mama. Here you go. Is that smoke? Where? No. No, please... What? Nothing. Auntie Stell? Mum's having everyone over for a barbecue, and she doesn't care how tired you are. Get your butt in here. A barbecue? I'd like to meet your family. I thought we'd wait a couple months before that. But I'm hungry. I have food at home. Where is he? We want to meet him. Winston? You in there, baby? Hey. Stella. Well, well, hi there, Winston. How do you do? As you can see, I'm even more beautiful and brilliant than whatever-her-name-is. Get your butt out of that car! OK. That's Vanessa. Right. A little outspoken. Can be downright tacky. I like her already. I know she in there talking about me. Nobody's talking about you. Let me see! Let me see! Hey, here they come! Can't wait to see them. Hey, y'all get out of the car! Welcome home. Yeah, he's up in there. Stella's got herself a man! Come on. We all waiting for you. Y'all in that car, get out now! Come on! Bring him out now! Stella! Ashamed or something? Open the door, Stella. Mom! Guess what. Dad's here! What?! Lord have mercy. Hey, Walter. Good to see you. What you doing here, spying? In town on business. Excuse me. I ran here as fast as I could just to see how miserable you are. So, Stella says you got 2 growing in here. Yep. Both boys, due in December. Well, I cannot wait to meet them. Are you coming back at Christmas or not leaving? Bid it if you dare. What? Hey, they got to know who's boss! Dad! Go, Dad! Stella, I'm not saying he's not nice. I'm not saying he's not educated. You can't possibly think this is going anywhere. Let's be serious for a minute here. Why don't you just shut the fuck up, Angela? Amen. Show my... Winston, I'm Walter. Nice to meet you, Walter. Hey! Well, thank God she don't need a man to pay her bills like some of us do. Let me just put the shit on out there, OK? And I don't care how old he is, if he got you glowing like a night light and shit, I say keep his ass. Thank you, Vanessa. I love you, Winston. She can be stubborn as all hell. But you know that by now. Don't you? Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I do. Thinks she knows everything. She's always right. I hate to admit it, but she usually is. Just don't bow down to her. Otherwise, she'll treat you like a chump and trade your ass in for a new model. Then I promise you, I won't. Good, 'cause she needs a man to stand up for himself. Did that work for you? Hell no. Hey! Break that mess up. Drop the bags. OK. So this is where you live. Yep. This is home. Come on, drop your bags. I'll give you a tour. OK? Yeah, it's OK, but your room is off-limits until it's disinfected. Come on! My mum's office. She made that desk. OK... last but not least, this is where my mum used to make all her stuff. She's thinking about turning it back into the guest room. So, I'm thinking about moving in here when I'm 15. More privacy. How long has it been since she's been out here? I don't know. Years. Before I started driving... my go-kart. Well, tour's over. Yeah, man. Thank you for showing me around. Can I talk to you? Man-to-man? Well, I don't see any kids around. Well, you know my mum likes you. Well, I hope so. I mean, I've seen her with other guys before, but she really likes you. How can you tell? You're the only one she's brought over here overnight. You're, like, staying. You wouldn't ever try to break her heart, or anything, would you? Because if you did, you'd have to deal with me. Let me tell you something, Quincy. As long as your mum has you watching her back, she got no worries, man. Of any kind. Thanks for letting me drive today, Winston. What? No! It was just out of the driveway and in an empty parking lot. There were no cars... No driving! He's old enough to drive! I'm a good driver! I learned when I was 9. He told me he wanted to celebrate his 16th birthday at the DMV. I know. The invitations go out on Monday. Really? Do they really do parties at the DMV? Aww... Is there anything I can do? I just wish I could call her. She was my best friend since forever. That's a long time to forget. You don't have to forget. That was wicked! Hey. Press it! Press the button! I'm pressing the button! And when are we gonna see you guys again? Y'all been holed up in that love den, and I want to know what y'all doing. When can we come over and get something to eat? You said he could cook, and until we get a sample you know I'm gonna think you're lying. Vanessa, I'm waiting for my future clients to call. I don't have time to check my dinner schedule, but Thanksgiving sounds good. Listen, I'll talk to you later. Wait a minute. How does Quincy like him? Bye, Vanessa. Well, what about the dog? He proposed to him last night. He's thinking it over. I'll talk to you later. Stella, wait... She hung up on me. I'm gonna have to call her again. Hey, come on! I'm coming! Goddamn! Be patient. There you go. Thank you, sweetie. Thank you for taking Quincy to Little League practice. No problem. I don't mind at all. Hello. My. I told you you was gonna like it. I saw you laughing, Stella. I saw you. Don't stand there and lie to me. Stella! Angela. We didn't see you guys in line. We were in the back. Forgive me. Judge Spencer Boyle, Leslie James, this is my sister Stella. So nice to finally meet you, Stella. You, too, Judge. How do you do? Fine, thank you. And Winston. Anybody hungry? Kennedy, how you feeling, man? Fine. Just grateful for an aisle seat. You know how those trips to the ladies' room get. Did you cry at the end or what? Well... Actually, we saw that one. You're kidding. No. It was... hilarious. Well, we're heading home. It was nice meeting you both. The offer still stands, Stella. If you change your mind about running, give me a call. Running? Well, we'd like that. All right. OK, man. Ta. Get home safe. Good night. Surprise. I'll say. What brings you all the way here and without calling? Were you at the mall? No. I wasn't at the mall. I want you to know that I didn't appreciate the way you totally disrespected Winston yesterday. What are you talking about? "That's Winston." Like he's some nonentity or some child. Well, he is. He's my boyfriend, Angela, all right? What did you want me to do, get out the trumpets? Let me say this once. I like him. You don't have to, but he's here till whenever, so you might as well get used to it. I'm... I'm sorry if I was rude. I didn't mean to be. But, Stella, aren't you the least bit nervous about this whole thing? Of course I am, Angela. Whatever you're cooking, can I taste it? Sure. Your check, sir. Thank you. OK. Hey. How are you doing? It's OK. I'll get it tonight. I don't mind. But I can manage. Why should you always pay for everything? Because you can't afford it. If you want me to be a man, let me act like it once in a while. Please put it away. Fine. Pay the mortgage next month while you're at it. Why'd you have to start this? Wait, wait, wait. I think you've got it backwards. Look at you. You're the one who has to have everything your way or no way. You're the one who always has to be in control, or you don't know what to do with yourself. You're turning it around because I'm picking up the stupid check? No. You can't decide whether you want me to be a boy or a man. Admit it. Admit it. Please. From the guy who made a midnight run to the video store and came back with Booty Call and L ion King? What the fuck is that supposed to mean? I feel as though I'm moving back instead of forward. Here I am in the prime of my life, and my boyfriend's idea of a romantic evening is watching the Disney Channel while you eat dry cereal. That's if you're not busy playing video games with Quincy. And how many times do I tell you to take out the trash? Or if the car's on "E," put a little gas in it. Cook something that doesn't give us all heartburn. That is my point. You know what, Stella? I'm tired, too, OK? I'm tired of being scolded every time I do or don't do something that's not on your long list of rules. I don't make the rules. Yes, you do. We don't go anywhere unless you suggest it. And then when I do, what happens? You might as well laugh in my face. Why don't we visit your friends? Are you ashamed of me? Am I a little well-kept secret? That is not true, and you know it. Stella, I can't change being 20. I can't change that, and you can't change your age, either. But you knew what we were dealing with before I came. So if you can't handle it or it's too much for you to deal with all of a sudden, then maybe we should just forget this whole thing. OK? If it'll make you feel any better, you leave the tip. I'm sorry. Come. I want to show you something. What have you done, Winston? I can't believe this. How did you... When did you? While you were snoring, running, shopping... I don't snore. My god. What's that? I don't believe it. So now you can make your own cracked glass table or zebra-skin sofa or anything you want whenever you want, and no one's ever going to bother you. Thank you. You are quite welcome. What we're trying to say is that in your absence it's become quite clear to us how important you are to the company. Merger or no merger, we're creating a spot for you, Stella. We want you to come back. Executive V.P. 275,000 to start plus incentives. Hey. Hey. You're back so soon. So, how'd it go? I cannot believe what I just did. What? I don't want to talk about it. They offered you your job back and... and you turned them down, didn't you? Yeah. You should have heard me going on and on about how I can do this on my own. But how am I actually supposed to do it? Am I supposed to sit at home with my computers, 4 little clients, and no support system whatsoever and wind up back in the job market in 6 months? I have too many responsibilities. This is crazy. No. No, it's not crazy. The business is going to be fine. Maybe now you'll have some time for yourself. You can come back in here and make things and start having fun again. Sweetie, listen, I cannot sit in here and be Demi Moore in dappled light. That is not the real world. You're just a little bit panicked now, but everything's going to be OK. You never know. Maybe once you start making your furniture again, people will buy it. Who said anything about selling it? Hey, I'm just dreaming out loud for you. While you're dreaming, I got a million calls to make. I got to get a web site, a company name, letterhead... But not today. I bought you something. Winston, you did not have to buy me a present. It's not exactly a present. You know, Winston, people... can be together a long time and love each other before they even think about doing something like this. It's just a simple question. All it takes is a yes or a no. My heart says yes, but just let me give it a little more thought, OK? OK. OK, son, show me the projects that you've worked on. I think we need to put the money into the computers, into the books, into the children. Well, I think you're wrong. He's my mum's new boyfriend. His name is Winston. He's from Jamaica. You know, when I went to Jamaica, we met him. When I went there... I'll be right there. What's wrong, Winston? What do you mean, what's wrong? You've been sulking since we got here. You've been sulking all day. I can't believe you're saying this to me. What, did I miss something? Last week, I asked you to marry me. To spend your life with me, and I don't have an answer. Do we have to talk about it now? How long do I have to wait? Or should I pretend that I didn't even ask? So you can be so selfish? Look, don't talk to my mama like that. Look, I'm talking to you! You need to jump back, boy! You don't speak to my son in that tone of voice. Yeah, because I don't appreciate it. Shut up, Quincy! Quincy, I'm sorry, man. For real. Come on, you guys. It's cool. Let's just go home, OK? Winston, we need to talk. I know. Climb in. Come on, I won't let you fall. All right, put your head back. All right. OK? Yeah, yeah. You know, I need to talk to you, too. Yeah? About what? No. Please, you can go first. No. You go. I've been thinking a lot about some of the things that you've been saying. Really? What things? You have a lot of worries in your life right now without figuring me into the picture, and a real man... The kind you deserve, would be making things a bit easier for you. Winston, you're not adding to my troubles, if that's what you're thinking. Besides... Money's a sad reason for folk to be together... or apart. Yes, but without it, life can be hard. Then there is the age difference. Well, that's never going to change. It doesn't bother me at all, you know, but I can see it bothers you. And I can't imagine what I'd have to do or tell you to convince you that no matter how many young girls I may notice... You are the woman that I want. I was hoping to one day be your husband, have some children, but I can see now that that could never happen. Probably not. You have a child and a mortgage and a career, and I have nothing. And I'm not satisfied with that. Not satisfied. Winston, don't worry. It's coming. You'll find your way. Well, I realize that I'm ready to go to medical school... So... I'm heading home on a 10:00 flight. Home? Why so soon? Because I think it's easier this way. Hey, now! So, should I call you Dr. Shakespeare? Yeah, not unless you want to die. All right, come here. I want you to take good care of your mum, now. Hear? No worries, man. I hope I can see you again, Winston. You're a great man. You're a great man, too. Maybe your mum will let you visit me one day? I hope so. Good-bye. Come here, boy. Come here. So, I guess I... I'll be going now. Yeah. I can see that. Go. Come on. I love you. More than 20 minutes. If you're on the way to the airport, forget 101. It's a mess. Take the 280. It should be smooth sailing from there. And that's it for traffic and weather on this rainy San Francisco night. Back to you, Dan. Thanks, Kelsey. Although union leaders are split... Got your ticket, sir? You can check straight through. You're at gate number 7. Have a good trip. Ever consider Stanford? Yes. Yes. Please rate this subtitle at %url% Help other users to choose the best subtitles
