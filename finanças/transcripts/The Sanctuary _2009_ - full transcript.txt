There is another thing... Mafia Wisa poisoned me. Poisoned you. You're serious. Do you see a doctor? Mafia poisoned me... ...with some Asian. Kind of Voodoo thing from his ancestor. Only he has an anti-dose. If I don't get the anti-dose in 48 hours, 48 hours. - That's not much time. - Guy Stop talking. Let me tell you the story. My great grandfather's men hid... ...3 Thai royal antiques and buried them somewhere But we managed to find one. The other 2... ...are still missing. So to cut the story short We want you to use your expertise to get the rest back. First thing first, General. The anti-dose? Hell. Why not? This one is the painkiller. For now. And this one will cure the poison. Gary, my ex-pal has been hiding in the Jungle... simply because he lost it. Gary is very lucky to have a friend like you. Have you found what I wanted? Your men buried the king's royal antiques more than 100 years ago. Give me a second. Hey you are the best money can buy... and you are military recon. I can have your antique back... ...in 2 days. 2 days 2 days 2 days 2 days Ok. But... we ganna need the anti-dose and my fee. Anti dose and your fee. You pushing it soldier. You know I am a very very generous man. There will be another one like this waiting here for you. When you deliver the other 2 pieces to me. Do we have a deal? Now to reassure that the task will be completed promptly. I'd have 3 of my best men to assist you. Btw, your camp looks really nice from the sattelite Krit. Krit. Sir. I have some business to settle. Can you please help take care of the mineral exploration team? They said they have come to survey the Minerals underneath our temple. Pichainoi leads them. Uncle Pichainoi Gary That's it. We found it, man. Uncle Pichainoi Hello. Uncle Pichainoi Sitkrupueam. Sunday like this, you're not off betting at the boxing stadium? How about you? Why don't you take care of your shop? I told Jon to do that already. - Wow, what are these foreigners doing? - That's impossible. - He must be dead - What is all the modern hi-tech stuff here for? Hey. Nothing, don't worry Just a mineral exploration team. I'll call you later. Told you already Will call later We can talk now. Go. Ok. You can call me later. What are they doing? Ok, pick it up. Pick it up. Ok. Ok. Holy mother, we found the antiques already. We made it. Welcome. This is the real antique from Banchiang krab. Real. Great. Mam, no photo. No photo. How can you tell it's genuine or not. Look. Sir and madam. It will have this color... clay color, same same. The texture is not smooth. Because it was buried with sand. If it's too smooth, it's fake believe me. See... Sand smell. How much is it? Please wait. Two thousand five hundred. I discount for you. - Thank you. - Harijato. No. No. Not ok. Don't by this. This is not good. Trust me. If you are interested in antique. You'd better go to Udonthani. And Asking for Banchiang museum. This is the real one better than here because all is fake. It's fake. Hey, lady. Why did you do that? Why not? I gave them the right information. What you said is all wrong, not even a single truth. - Everything here is fake. - And how do you know? I know. I'm an archaeologist. I have to know what is real or fake. I just came back from an internship in Banchiang antique village. Why did you lie to them about the antiques? - Who will come to visit Thailand? - Fake or real, it has nothing to do with you. The foreigner who buys this should know already. The cheap products can't be real. I sell Banchiang Souvenirs, not real Thai Banchiang antiques. If I sell the real ones, the Fine Art Department will put me in jail. - Brother Krit. - Right? - Right. You'll be put in jail. - Brother Krit. What? A meteorite has fallen into the temple. - Meteorites? - Nonsense. / I saw a huge hole. - See, you're both liars. - Go away first, I am busy here. Believe me, Brother Krit. I am not lying. - Hurry. - Is it for real? - Hurry. - Real? Hurry up. - Hurry up... bro. - What's the hurry, Jon. Professor, what were they stealing anyway? What they stole is the royal antiques. How did you know about these? Look at the way they pulled the antiques out of the ground. And the antiques' size and the top soil. It matches perfectly with the size and shape of the antiques. And look at the soil's layer. It should be over hundred years. Moreover, look at the texture of these antiques. It looks like many tiny overlapped jigsaws. It's very hard to do in those days. Yes. In the old days, a lot of thieves stole antiques and buried them in the soil somewhere. And come back to retrieve them later. Because it might be difficult to carry them away unseen. Then they came back to retrieve them. Sometimes... ...it makes the value go higher too, like Krit does. Somebody nowadays still behaves the same way the ancient people did... I think we should report to the police. Krit. If you have any clues. Try to find them. If they can make the fake one, - How do I know about it? - Praifa should be able to help you then. She knows about the Royal antiques from my class. Me? Are you afraid? Ok. Prof. Since it's you who asks me, I will work with him but just this one time Sir, I think Uncle Pichainoi is involved with this. I'll go and get the information from him. - Hello. - Go and check outside. Ok. Let's go. Oh That's you. How long have you been here? Please give this book to Ram the monk. There is a photo inside. So the police won't say we are making the story up. A group of foreigners comes to stay at the temple and said they are mineral explorers. After that we found a big hole. I think I know where to get a clue. Then we will report to the police to follow up. Are you interested to come with me? Hey, you... Actually, I'm not a bad guy, an evil fake Banchiang antique seller, But I do love my country just as much as you do. Oh, great Why're you telling me? This way please. Uncle... Uncle Pichainoi? His shoes are still here. Uncle? Uncle? Come in. Uncle Pichainoi? Hey, Come over here. There is nothing here. Uncle... Uncle Pichainoi I think you should call the police first. Uncle Uncle Hello, dad I want to report. Dad, it's me Fah. Hello? Can you hear me? Dad. What's up I am in the middle of interrogation. Not free to talk. I'll call you back. Good... I'll do it myself then. Whatever I want to do, you prohibited anyway. They work for Mafia Visa, ...illegal weapon traders and drug dealers living on Thai-Burmese border. The organization hired an international expert to steal the Royal antiques. They believe the possession of these antiques will bring them the spiritual power to acquire whatever they want. We are dealing with an international thief? They also believe that... the price in the world market of the royal antiques is tremendous. The oil rich men want to buy them for their antique collections. That's the royal antiques they found. But there should be 3 of them Where is the other one? "In my life I have never done a good deed, but this time." That's the mineral exploration team. Come over here. What's next? That way Hurry. Come on. Let's go. Come on. - This way. - Get out. Go. Hurry up. Come on. Come down Sir. What happened to him? What happened to him? He got beat up and fell from the floor. I told him to go to the hospital but he said you can cure him better. - Are you using herbs to cure him? - It's a rare and special Thai herb. And difficult to find. It will only grow in a cave where the sun can shine inside. We must smash it until we get the liquid. And pour to help soothe the pain. Then we cover the wounds with the crushed herb like this... It's an ancient curing method. The herb will absorb into the wound, and will cure the bruised muscle. The next day it will be gone like a miracle. Krit knows well because I cured him every time like this since he was young. And where do his parents live now? Krit's father... ...was my boxing trainer. Krit also had a twin brother. Their father wanted them to be he same as him. But after he died, the boy's lives are totally changed. At that time I quit boxing and became a monk. So, I've taken care of the twins ever since. No matter how well we raise the twin orphans, they wouldn't be the same. Eventually, Kirk is gone and the other stays. We are all born with karma so we have to repay it anyway. This necklace is the only thing his brother left for him. Does he know who killed his father? The only evidence found was the baseball bat with the eagle tattoo on No. 6. The police still can't close the case. And I never told Krit about how his brother died. I only told him... ...he rested in peace and was happy. Oh, excuse me. Have you ever seen these two guys? They look very familiar to me. They look just like the exploration team a couple of days ago. - Anyway, I have to go now. - God bless you. "Hi, spy web members." "Thank you. *spy-888* for helping me search for antiques places in Rangsit" "Today 000-want your help." "These guys stole our national treasure." "They are heading to the border area," "to the druglord." "Please inform if you spot them." Found was the baseball bat with the eagle tattoo on No. 6. "Found the stolen dudes." "Where are they?" "17.00" "Ayuthaya, pass the 120th milestone. Turn right." "I hope the dudes exhausted." "How do we reach them in time." "Easy." Yes, we've come the right way. Your lighter? My boy friend's. Dumped already. You want it? It's still new. Keep it. It's old for me. Thank you. - Everything get taken care of Gary. - Basically, We can't be relax just yet. There is a boy and a girl stuck their nose in. They know something. Which way? Left or right? Can you help me with this? Here, this way. It's easy to find. You're wasting time, you know? Oh...
