SORREL FLOWER (COLOUR THEM DEAD) The child of Pierre Gasperi and Catherine Aigroz came to life at 8 a.m., at the maternity hospital of Port-Royal boulevard. It's a 8 pounds big boy. Terrific. You still have to give him a name. There's plenty in the calendar. In the absence of imagination she demonstrated some memory. So, here is little Pierre... Is that the name of the father? Was. Oh, sorry... An accident? You can call it like this. Of course... It's... The social worker was a sweet and nice person, who was spreading the good word and buying discounted shoes. And your decision, how should we call it? A crazy thing? A mistake? You're not gonna put him in an orphanage? My name is Catherine Aigroz. In the newspapers: "pretty Cathy", got it? "Lucky Pierrot", the shooting, doesn't it ring a bell? Yes... There was a story. You can say that. Under what scheme are you? I'm free, don't worry. Dismissal. I didn't know anything. Are you surprised? The cops eventually admitted it. That's the most surprising. They gave you troubles? A little. That's why my milk's gone sour. Where do you plan to go once outside? - I don't know. - Don't you have a place? - No. - You don't want to tell me. I'm not from the police. It can stay between us. Between us, I don't know where I'll go. Any incoming money? None. It's feeding time. What would you say of month holiday, paid by the state? A mother's house, in province... You'll have some fresh air, the child too. You have time to think about it. I'll come back to see you. I you expect to change my mind about the kid, I can already tell you it won't happen. It was neither yes nor no. And it was no holidays either. - I'll carry him for you. - There's no reason. There's one. I always worked. But you... Up to you. The romantic power of the words ring out stronger in idiotic brains. Wife of a big shot fall on the field of honour, Catherine didn't want any publicity. She better liked, at the moment, keep the anonymity of an identification number. You'll have bed n?17. Affinities between numbers are a myth. N? 17 not always becomes the friend of n?18. But this time, she did. N?18 distinguished herself from the others by an exclusive mood and a hot temper. Get lost ! Come on! Out! Good night, Marit?. Good night. Sleep well. Get dress, my child. It's not quite over, yet. Okay. I'll meet you at the nursery. So, in the Aigroz family, no congenital illness? Your parents? - Still alive? I know. They just manifest themselves. A rather naive letter, but touching. If you want to read it... - No, thanks. They forgive you. Forgive me for what? If you pretend to be someone else, there's 20 years I run this house. Whether you're passive or in revolt, you won't impress me. My parents are honesty procurers. Full up of morality like others are stuffed with baby food. A morality of their own, of course. I didn't know there was more than one. There's the one of the wolves and the one of the sheeps. They were of the sheep kind. And full of maxims. "Chi va piano, va sano", "Good health is above wealth", "Life is..." Can't remember, but it was probably another great one. "Life is the only school you left without having learn anything." Well. And then the father of the baby arrived. Yes, of course. He was talking about life too, but it was more like: "I drink in other's people glass". I see. Me too. That's why I'll keep away from stereotypes and reheated meals. I choose caviar. Caviar is no solution. Shit neither. Madame Aigroz, there's a visitor for you. Cecile, can you do it for me? If it's my folks, I'll throw them out. Well, superintendent! That's a surprise, isn't it? What have you done with your waistline? Bravo, bravo, bravo ! And so? How's the kid? Want to interrogate him? I just came to chat five minutes, like a friend. Don't laugh, it's true. I'm offering you a dowry. What would you say of 5 million? Old or new? Old, but it's already nice. A quest for the repentant girls? The Funds National Bank is throwing in the towel. 5 millions to whom will point out the bundle. What bundle? That's pretty Cathy's answer. Exactly as expected. I'm waiting for the answer of my little Catherine. The answer of a charming young lady, that I'd like to see back on tracks. All the press is speaking about Pierrot's bundle. Don't tell me you didn't read the papers. Not the humorous ones. Let's stop bullshitting. I've a full in my hands and I'm giving it to you. It's a nice sum! There's no dirty trick! You won't be charge for any crime, complicity or concealment. Listen, you don't have to answer now. Talk to your lawyer, ask him what he thinks. He'll tell me to talk, but talk about what? I don't know anything. You have a kid to take care of. - It maybe won't last long. - It's up to you. What's up to me is to find the bundle. Before the others. - The others? All the ones who are gonna come to see you. You're gonna have some visit. Do you know Albert Roza? - No. Riton Godot ? No. You don't belong to the underworld, why would you respect them? As long as you were with Pierrot, they were sucking you up. But you're not from the same world, they always had hated your guts. When they speak of you, do you know how Albert is summarising it? A cashing whore. I'm telling it because I have the right to. As you're a cop! So I'll speak as a cop! The bundle is value at 300 or 400 grands. As soon as you'll step out, they'll be all over you. I'm not on your side and I'll let them do or I'll get ride of them. Your choice. I'll tell you if I knew! - No, and I can't force you. But Riton and Albert, they're no choirboys. Riton is a vet of the counter. He used to work in a bar. He doesn't have shaky hands! I can't make it up. I don't know anything! Yes, well... They'll maybe won't touch you. They'll take it out on the kid. They'll crush him a hand. - You have no right! - I have all the rights, I'm a cop! And after you'd talk, because you'll talk to them! They'll throw you in the water, dead, at Conflans's lock! Give me a break, I don't know anything! See you at the locks. I don't know what's keeping me... You are in an hospital! She's under my protection. Get out. Don't make me order it to you. Excuse me. I'll be back. - You certainly won't. Come, Aigroz. Before the end of the afternoon, Catherine had another visit. If the superintendent's manners weren't very good, his information were. Say, you do know some people... Here she is, the sly little devil! We're looking for you everywhere. You almost drove us crazy. We should be mad at you! Not a word! Old friends like us! We thought we'd see you at the funerals. There was a lot people. Too much. Roza and her clique, can you figure that? We thought Riton was gonna start shooting! He just spitted on Roza's shoes. Riton's been incredible. You should have seen him. He wanted a mass, with singers and everything. In Saint-Eustache. Les Halles, that was where Pierrot used to hang out. Le square des Innocents. That's funny. Let's not think about it. The duty of women is the future. - That wasn't necessary. - That's for your son. Can we see the cuttie? No, they're not joking with the rules here. They gave you that coat? Bastards... How can they dare dress like this Pierrot's chick! A woman like you, used to get served. One can lose his habits. Good habits must be kept. We're taking you to Fontenay-le-Vicomte. Riton is inviting you. You'll take some vacation with your brat and take it easy. A mother needs to rest. Riton is nice. He has good heart. Unfortunately, I can't go out before two weeks, the doctor won't agree. Always those fucking rules. - Are you sure? I asked about it. So, what are we doing? We'll wait if we have to. And Riton too. He's gonna be disappointed. And so am I. We're sorry, we're in a hurry. We are expected. Goodbye, sweetie. Have a nice way back. Goodbye. Here you go. We'll come back next week, for sure. You can count on us. Bye, my darlings! See you soon! Who are they, your "darlings"? Two bitches. And so? The one who just said "and so", it's Riton. By describing him as a former from the Gestapo, Verdier was just citing an insignificant event. The one who didn't talk is called Jo. "Jo de Frejus", to be precise. A new pawn on Riton's chessboard. A pawn who can make a game extremely enlivened. The mums had a day out once a week. Catherine decided to use that right. Marit? asked to come and Catherine didn't say no. A faithful heart, inside a straightforward person, can be very useful. Assuming that the pig's predictions are confirmed. This confirmation came out as an old acquaintance. Mr Francis, little nonchalant assassin. Albert Roza's henchman. Aigroz, having a walk? Meeting you here... Where are you going? Can I take you? I'm almost there and I'll walk. - A friend of you? - Yeah. She could walk back alone. I've to talk to you. You came for nothing. Pierrot maybe had an hideout, but I don't know where. Tell Roza he can swing a pendulum over a map. I don't know anything. Come... - Don't touch me. - I'm just a go-between. Don't touch me. Bothering a mother? Because we may ask for help... Madame is getting along with the pigs? Madame is getting bribes? Bravo. Like this I know where my taxation is going. Wow! You really are a different person. When I'll tell that to Albert... I don't give a damn about what he thinks. Just between you and me, if you want... You know you're even more beautiful. Tell me, Marit?. Can you figure me dating that faggot? Morons! Cunts! I'm in luck. I just made a new friend. Calm down, now. Go back to sleep. You should start to get used to it. What does it mean? - I'm leaving. You can't, the nursery is closed. You can't leave your kid. So I just wait to be iced? I'm talking about your kid! If I don't come back, he's yours. I beg you pardon. If you want to be my friend, don't act like a bitch. You, sleep. That's dictatorship! We'll talk about it at ease. I can't take it anymore, you know? I'm a bit like his godfather. What do you mean by "a bit like"? I kinda brought her up. Excuse me if I speak frankly, Mister... Albert Roza. Mr Roza. If you brought her up, there's nothing to be proud of. I know, I should had watch over her better. Take care of her problems. But modern life, business... Catherine was impressionable. She had a lot of freedom. You know how it is. Shady acquaintances, chain of misfortunes. A faux-pas, and that's it. Here, all the girls made at least one. What our Catherine needs, to start again from a firm footing, is to find an home, a balance. If she's okay, I'd like to take her as soon as tonight. Do you think the outside air made any good to her? Properly advised, she should pull herself back together. She's expecting you. I was sure of it. That's sweet. Let me look at you. You know you look great? I was asking myself "How's she gonna look?". I'm fine, as you can see. Good for you. After the misfortunes you had, I was hoping you'll keep your chin up. I was thinking about the kid. Pierrot's son is like holy ground. First, I'll be his godfather. I insist. I swore it to Pierrot. I heard you came at the funeral, thanks. Are you kidding me? It would has been a bit if I didn't come. Riton was there too. I heard he sent you those stupid tarts. And Francis, who sent him? Santa Claus? An unlucky initiative. A faggot's mistake. I gave him an earful. Nobody else? Yes. Superintendent Verdier. It's better that way. like this, you know. He must had told you the rumour. About Pierrot's piggy bank. I heard they're offering 10 or 20 grands... 50. 50 grands! While 4000 are waiting for us... Who's us? I was thinking about the kid. They want to strip him of. Say... It's time to go for it. I'm okay with that... The question is to know what to do. At the end, he wanted to adopt the kid and put me in a fancy apartment. I think he cried at some point. - He was maybe sincere. - He was crying on the dough. I can repeat a hundred times I don't know anything, they don't believe me. Maybe, even you. Me ? Admit you thought about it. When I'll leave, they'll be plenty of people on the wheel. The hyenas' caravan. A cuckolds' marathon, as you don't know anything. I do know. Something has been said, who was gonna give the start of the treasure hunt. 55 baby's vests, 60 napkins. Lucky Pierrot succeeded his last hold-up. And in some ways, his death. But where did he stash the money away? Nothing was found. Only Catherine knew. She was rich, assuming she could leave the place. She had to leave the mother house. But becoming hunter and game doesn't presage a bright future. But, at the end of the road, there was fortune. A relic from the luxurious days was sell off in bad circumstances. In order to buy a car in poor condition. It was not about making a good deal, but to be quick. Eventually, the time of the depart came. You took your time. It's your son. I had to change his napkin. He was crying. Not a word! Of course, Cathy. - Things look good. - Yes. Riton, they took the Montargis road. As planned. A car from Roza's gang is tailing them. As planned. I'll hook on the caravan. Bye. See you later. Shit! Hello, M. Albert? It's me. We're at the highway exit, we're heading to Montargis. - Montargis? - You were right. I always do. The car is waiting downstairs, we're almost there. I leave right now. - Hey... hello? Boss! Hello! Were you calling for help? Hey! Little Jo... What a surprise! What are you doing here? I go for a roll in the hay. You were calling Roza? No, I just remember I have a date and... What did you tell him? Montargis? Riton's left rue Fontaine already a while ago. I'm fair, I tell you all. Yeah. Roza just left. And he means business. A treaty was quickly closed. I'm following you. All the more so as Mr Jo was armed. And that Francis, too confident, for once, wasn't. Here. What about a small tip? That's not the day! What is it? The first bottle. Stop! Can't you refuel In-flight? If you want to make them sick. Did you see them? - Yes. What are we doing? We're waiting. That's the moment to bust their arse. You can answer. Why are you staring at my boil? Riton says your nastiness is going out from the skin. I think that's your stupidity. How many stops are we doing? One every 3 hours. But if it's bothering you, we can let them starve and bury them into the woods. Of course not, I'll stop every three metres. I want to hear them get fat. It's nothing. Don't answer. That's the house. Without feeding bottle issue, Mr Roza took the lead. And that wasn't a particularly good place. Shit, a road block. Don't worry! Car registration document, tax sticker, driving licence and season talk. That was gonna be a fine day for outdoor sports. I can't believe it. The Roza Brothers. Expecting to talk with women, Mr Riton's took the legality appearances. Turn right. Call that an accident! He was probably driving too slowly... Typical, Montargis... Split between her pilgrimage love and her frenzy for money, Catherine was following Pierrot's route, step by step. I'd like to ask you something. I'm maybe wrong but... The smile to the owner and the way you've ordered without looking the menu. You want to know if I already came? Yes. - With... - Yes. You must feel funny. Let's speak about something else. I hope the children won't wake up. I'll go see them after I took a cream, a fruit, and a cake. By the way, how's your house? Hey! I'm talking to you. Try to listen. How is it? - Do you know Corsica? I never left my hometown. - Do you know the Colorado? - Yes. It's the same. Come on, friends! It's a bit cold. Waiter! Waiter, the phone is ringing... Waiter, we're out of wafers. Waiter. - If you allow me. It's very kind of you. He's very kind. Here! Infamous, Francis was kept away from the agapes. He was holding it against his partner. Taking up with the old one again wasn't illogical. Don't yell at me! I couldn't tell you before. I spent my day driving. I'm in the Alps. - In the what? The Alps! In Seranon if you want to know everything. It's wild, but beautiful. I know. And the person we like, did she notice you? Are you kidding? I'm an ace at this. - Any any of where you're heading to? - None. Admit you're surprised. I should be cashing the third. What do you think? We'll see. - What? - We'll see. You doesn't sound enthusiast. Don't mind that, I'm in a mess. Family troubles. How can I say... This morning, we met some buddies. We celebrated and I can't stand my booze anymore. Not at all? Almost. Jeez... I'll be at your hotel soon anyway. You'll now how to reach me. It was here. 40 kms away from the sea, and 900 kms away from Pigalle, that Lucky Pierrot and Pretty Cathy were turning into Mr and Mrs Lhomond. a loving couple, living in a romantic farmhouse, by the name of an old French song, "Thorn flower". My house. - Wow. When you said rustic, you really meant rustic! Do you need help? Look at the tile. - It's broken. No, removed. The dough is here, for sure. Didn't your boyfriend got the keys? He never got the keys! I follow you? - No, I'll open the door, you're my guest. Did we had a good sleep? What? Are we quiet awake? Aren't you afraid to be burgled? You've got quite old pieces of furniture. Why are you laughing? Pierrot, be burgled! That would have been a bit rich. I have been happy in this house, you know. I tell you that because I'll probably blow everything away. Empty the wardrobes, rip the mattresses open, act like a vulture. Last spring, we came three weeks. The time of dreams and projects. So much for our projects, one is now taking it easy. We didn't make plans for the rest. We were supposed to do up the second floor, put the water and electricity. To plant flowers. I'll prefer if we split quickly. Do you think we'll find? - We have to. - I can't figure if it's big. Dollars, in small denomination, it probably fit a briefcase. I can't believe it, are they gonna eat again? No water. Is there some here? There's a well near the car. Don't move! Oh, fleeting vision! Eternity of temporary, instant grace! Thank you, Mrs, thank you! An orchard behind you and It was a Renoir. What I admire with Renoir, it's his women. I hate orchards. I loathe them. Small French vegetals, stunted and stupid! I can't stand it! Edmond Galli?res. Cursed painter. 20 years under the tropics. Re-learned everything, Recreated everything. Show Edmond a flower, he paints a baobab. Your breasts will be in the Louvre! Don't start that again or you'll feel sorry! Let's run away from Europe, let's be niggers! It's not the painter who's speaking now, it's the man of the world. The exquisite neighbour. Is your mistress here? - My mistress? - Aren't you the maid? Who's maid? I'm gonna beat you up again! I mean Mrs Lhomond, my too discreet neighbour. I'd like to pay her my homage. Make it snappy, it's the feeding bottle time. Feeding bottle? Don't you forget something, man of the world? Oh, sorry. Don't bother, my dear Madame. It's only a friend! Mr Galli?res. What a pleasant surprise! It's my spring-cleaning! Is your husband in the village? No, stuck in Paris. He won't be here before a week. He's working too much. I'll tell him off. You must have seen him recently. Briefly. Arrived on the morning, gone on the evening. We didn't had the time... So that was true for the feeding bottles! And twins! Well, almost... Congratulations. Your husband didn't mention it. Which one will smile to uncle Edmond first? Come on! Aren't you in school? Hands away! What's their name? Pierre and Jean. The favourite apostles. Oh yes? Be seated. - I've no time. - I'm inviting you for dinner tonight. Nothing fancy. Preserved goose, Arles sausage, with a Gigondas ros?. Will you come? - We won't. - Are you sure? - We are. I put my compliments down at your feet. I'll come back tomorrow to check if you have everything you need. You do that. Why did you see say no? Preserved goose, Arles sausage... He's only dreaming about this meal. I know him... At the last moment, he tells you his fridge broke down. And eventually, he's the one coming to your place, and you're the one cooking. If you want to eat, we'll have to do the shopping. Here, honey... But that's for babies! Because there's babies. What? Mr Pierre gave you a child? - Two. I always knew this man was loving you. I also think so. Did he came with you? He'll try to come next week. Who's gonna have a bath? It's me! Just what I need with this heat. You won't do that? I am! What are you waiting for? I'll do it! My little duck! Is it my eyes or the binoculars? Really... Wrong side, what a schmuck! You're right, it feels good. Disgraceful mother! Ah, hostile old age! Sorry, maestro. Do you mind? Who are you? Here. Mister? In front of children. How disgraceful! Mr Galli?res? The painter? Yes! Some friends spoke to us about you. Beautiful, isn't it? Another one. Nicer! A better one. That's nothing, I'll pick it up. Gauguin already took Polynesia. Bastard! But suddenly, the obviousness, the necessity. Cambodia. My painting is a scream! A murder. You like it or not. I like it. Me, if you want to know... You like it! You don't let me talk. I would buy everything! I take this one. I don't know for the other two. One for sure. Maybe both. If we find an agreement. I'm not a money-grubber. Neither do I. What's dough anyway? My dear maestro, you don't buy a painting like a washing-machine. You must think about it. I can't think well on an empty stomach. What would you say of a picnic between friends? I'm sure there's a grocer in the village. - A very good one. - My secretary will go there. An assortment, smoked fish, sausages, pasta... To stretch the diet rules, I'll recommend a truffled guinea fowl. Did you hear that? Move, old chap. Don't forget the wine. Gigondas ros?. I won't be sad if you find some Champagne. Take this! And this! Yes, honey... Don't you think that's what real life is? Countryside, fresh air, kids. Be careful of the local ros?. Pierrot tend to see mirages too. He was speaking vineyards, sheeps, he was thinking to take out a loan at the Farm Bank. Even sober, the Farm Bank was his dread. You know, he shaked it twice. A funny fellow. Where did that moron hid the dough? It's so hot! Why don't we go to sleep. "Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof." And "it's better sleep on it", you carry on. You're the daughter my father should had. We're not gonna bring the house down. Could he had left an indication? Like a note on the door? You're right, I'm talking nonsense. Khmer art, my friend... The 11th and 12th Cambodian centuries. I wrote a ballet. An extravaganza. In 53 chapters. With music and everything. With the same style as in the past. I'll read it for you. - I hope so. You have everything you need? No more food to buy? - Why? Can I take a walk? I can't stand him anymore, I'm gonna hit him if I stay. Excuse the break in, maestro. What were you saying? I can't remember. Marit?! Wake up! Wake up! I know where the money is. Look at the ceiling. It's flat. It's flat at the church too. How is he roof above? It's a sloping roof. There's an empty space. The dough's inside. Look, it can maybe wait for tomorrow. We just have to climb. Come on, move! Come on! That's not happening! What did I tell you? Let's find a ladder. - Where? Anywhere. Marit?! Marit?! Where are you? Marit?! Answer me! There's someone in the garage. Come. Where's your ghost? - There was someone. Here, look... Naughty bastard. - Who is it? - Francis. "Little butts of little angels..." You're singing? I admire you. No, I'm scarred too. The children! Where were we? At Mr Lhomond. Your friend, Pierre. You said he came 2 or 3 months ago. Lhomond? I'm the loaded one, now. Let's have a new talk about my commission. I don't think so. From now on, we're working at 50/50. I'm not trying to take advantage, you see. Do we have a deal? Give me my gun back and I'll maybe answer you. You've got some nerve. Or you're trying to piss me off. And that wouldn't be very clever of you. Actually, that's your weak point. Not in my house! Put down that penknife! What are we waiting for? So? Now! Tell him to seat down. I bore with your peanuts, I won't bear with your cutlery trade. Be a consistent monkey! That's his fault! You saw it, he asked for it! Beat it! I know where the bread is. I saw the girls. You'll give me what you want. 50 grands! 30 grands... Beat it. Let's find a ladder. That's in the tower. I'm fair, do I? I tell you all I know. I put things right. Tell me I put things right... Do you really want me to go? Okay. Then I go. You're not gonna shoot me, huh, little Jo? Give me your word. - Beat it. Francis fucks you! Hear that? He doesn't give a shit about you! Call a priest. Don't you prefer a doctor? I'm dying. I leave my house to Mrs Lhomond and my paintings to the government. Come on... Hear that? Yes. I'm scarred. - Not only you. Anybody home? Anybody home? We're plenty! Is that you, Madame Catherine ? There's no Madame Catherine. Only sleeping children! We'd better have a good talk. Talk about what? With whom? Names aren't important. I'm carrying a wounded man. The local Gauguin. Show yourself! - Okay. Are you armed? Of course. Put your gun down at the door and step back where you are. We'll can maybe talk. No way! Then, vanish! I'm counting to 3 and then I shoot! That's gonna draw some people attention, don't you think? - That goes for all of us. - Right. Okay! I keep my head down because of the artist. But you're gonna need me, so don't do anything stupid. Need him, is he joking? Maybe not. And so, that gun? Come on. Go check! If we don't make it snappy, we're gonna lose a painter. Let him in. You can come in. Search him. I left the packaging to you, but not what's inside. Don't push it. But If that makes you happy... Forget it. Did I met you before? In Seranon, yes. I handled you the wafers. It's nice of you to remember. There's faces like this... Do you want me to leave? I won't do anymore knife painting. Ah! A priest! Come on, that's nothing. Marit?, take care of him. It hurts. I'm so much in pain! It hurts... Francis came by. Do you know about it? - Yes. - Are you with him? I thought so but he messed up. You're with whom, then? Maybe with you. Francis says we need a ladder. To climb where? Don't answer. I don't trust him. It's not very nice to question other people's honesty. - How much would you take? - Make me an offer. Ouch! Help! Francis must be shitting his pants. Roza maybe already know, he's gonna show up before noon. Then, it's gonna be fast. I'm afraid you're gonna feel lonely. You're showing off and trying to hoodwink us. Who are you exactly? I'm Jo. Pierrot used to call me Jo de Frejus. Because of something I did. I heard. His nickname, "Lucky Pierrot", I gave it to him. I don't try to soften you up, I just tell. The dough is in the church's attic. I mean, I think. I work for a third. Okay? For that money, I take care of your passage and everything. Passage? You don't expect to stay in France? We find, we share, we split. Okay. But that's only the beginning. Roza, Riton and the coppers are still gonna be around. You need some new air. I thought about Switzerland. Is that so? Funny. I don't know. I'm not used to it. Pierrot was taking care of everything in my life. I understand, Madame Catherine. What's this? The last feeding-bottle. The next day, despite some serious searches, the 400 million weren't found. I'm thirsty... I'm hungry... I'm passing away, I'm passing away! Im passing away. Nothing here nether. There's trust for you. Why don't you go check the cellar? - Why don't you instead? - I don't think so. Tower, cellar... Pierrot was clever than that. If it's nowhere to be found, I better like stay in bed. When two people think the same thing at the same moment, what does it mean? You're never missing an occasion, huh? I'm passing away. Ah ! Oh, I'm speaking loud.. So? - Still nothing. - Is that so. If you could had seen his face when I bought the two guns. He almost passed out when I bought the buckshots. That's what you asked me to buy, right? For lack of anything better. He said no one ever shot partridges with that. If we fix then, we'll maybe manage to turn them into weapons. There's your olives, chillies, pepper and flour. Thanks. Wow, awesome. By the way, our partner... Guess what? Did he shag you? Are you crazy? But he tried. It doesn't seem to upset you. Just try to understand him. The country, two girls alone... You too? This morning, when we were searching the tower. It's a real case. He doesn't know what he want. Yes, he does! You or me? Try to figure out with an optimist! Hey, girls! What? Some tourists are showing up. A car is coming. Roza. He requisitioned the Red-Skins. "Shaven Jeannot". Mauser 96, 9mm with hollow grip. "Flat riding". P08, 9mm Luger. Plain grip, long barrel. "The Biker". Browning G.P. 35, 9mm parabellum. "The Musician". Always loyal to the 11-43 machine gun. "Waltzer Dany". Guewam 9mm machine gun. "Sissy Freddy". Walter P.P.K. Manurhin 9 mm. And the other fucker is touring them. I don't think Albert is gonna play the gunners. He's gonna ask for a talk. That's his shit. Not mine. - They're eight. - We're three. Why not five with the kids? They're eight, we're one. That's why I pay you a third. Open the shutters, Cathy. I know you're listening. We're not hiding. So why do you? We're friends, we can find an agreement. That's what I came for. Then just get lost! Don't say things like this. That's not nice. I've always been your friend. I don't know what you've been told. A priest! Just what we needed. - It's not my fault. I didn't come that far for nothing. I leave my boys outside, I come alone and we talk business. The milk is on the terrace. Want to ask him to bring it? - No... - Then shut up. And them too. I knew you're a reasonable person. I'm glad. I'm even proud of you. - Don't come closer! I'm talking to Catherine Aigroz, not to the delivery boy. You're right, I take orders. And the orders are to gun you down if you come closer. You're gonna have troubles, little Jo. Are you sure we can't talk? Where are you? Here. We'd better talk between men. When you have cartridges, it's to use them. Albert, can you hear me? Yes, my child... That's the last time! Adoption, marriage, and now break in. So now you wave, and you hit the road! I've a gun and don't know how to use it, so you're more than likely gonna taste it. Gun them down! That's enough for today. Come on... It's nothing. Just mum killing bad boys. Dany. Not mine, Dany! I have to, Jo ! - That changes everything. - What does it change? It was supposed to be an happy withdrawal, now it's an angry one. - We're still withdrawing? - Yes. To be frank, I'm not very keen on that kind of surprise gunshootings, Not keen at all. It get on everybody's nerve. You have to teach me how to take aim. I'd plenty of things to teach you. With Dany, we knew each other since the workhouse. Last summer, we sailed together. Now, he's dead. Do you think that's normal? Roza is a gossip man, I'm gonna hold some funny bag. I would have answer personally for Little Jo's mentality. What a lesson. Money spoil everything. Chicks too. He's taken between the lecherous ogress and the big knocker. Poor guy! Passions are passions. We'd better talk bread. The deal has changed. Not for me! But you're dumb. You're right, the deal has changed. Did you guess what we're looking for? - We start to figure out. - To suspect something. And that's why being just hired hands is no longer enough. Okay for the promotion. Everyone should be able to make a living. Attack the fortress with Jo around is not gonna be easy as pie. We were eight, there's already one less. How many are we gonna be tomorrow? So let's proceed like a fixed capital company, where the shares will raise by elimination. In hope, of course, that we'll all survive. Stop wriggling. I'm not wriggling, I'm twitching, like a wild animal, smelling danger. Without trying to offend you, I can smell something fishy. Is the painting lover an assassin? What a strange idea! I saw him turn into a gravedigger. One dig a hole to put something inside. You, me... who knows? Are you here? The old nutcase already see us all dead. He's right. What? Roza is not the type of guy to forgive trespasses. Dany's death could be forgotten. So as my gunshot. Even if I could had refrain myself... I thought you were great. The mistake, the real one, is to have offended him. Men are so sure of their superiority. We're just good to stand at attention. Conclusion? With or without the money, we have to hit the road. We're not cut out for war. There's already one dead. 400 million, that wasn't bad at all. Keeping our health isn't bad neither. That's enough. I take my kid and I go. Do what you want. The car's dead. We'll call a taxi from the village. For whom? Is Galli?res leaving? We'll leave at night. I'm scarred. You're wrong. You're the only one here that doesn't risk her life. You don't know where the bread is but Roza thinks you do. You're untouchable. Also, I got involved too much. We have to go at the end of it. And together. Why? I'm useless and everything I do gets on your nerves. You won't get on my nerves, you'll just do as I say. Come. Let's work a bit. Come on... Long barrels are meant to shoot far. With accuracy. With this, on a short range, it's no more shooting, it's spraying. You hit your target even blindfolded. - What target? The danger, it's Francis. What are we eating? After them. If someone show up, just yell. Change the guard, if you don't mind! It's bottle-feeding time! Just a second! Let's get back to it. He comes from behind and says "Hands up". Go ahead. Then, I slowly raise my hands, I move my left foot forward, and I turn... - To the right, or you fall down. To the right. B+. You're tough! That's a real feast, my dear. Wonderful! I'll come back! But be careful. Incorruptible, Edmond Galli?res. As soon as he'll arrive, I'll have to keep my friend Pierre Lhomond informed of the villainous things happening here. A bit higher. Your mutton stew was wonderful. But there's a dead man in the garden. Can you stay five minutes without talking nonsense? Do you read the papers? Never. Since the scuttling of the Action Fran?aise... All right, I'm listening. There never was... there's no more Mr Lhomond. Did you ever heard about Lucky Pierrot? Let me tell you, Madame... I'll have some bread. I had dinner several time at the table of a reigning prince, or even of a governor. At the worst of a prefect. But Lucky Pierrot, I don't have the honour... Come here. Hide the kids. Come on, don't be afraid. Bob. Light and sound... Why? They don't want you to run away in the dark. We're tranquil. As long as there's light, they won't attack. You must admit it's not common. I'd gladly have a smoke. Turn it off, God damnit! Luckily I'm here. This one inflame himself too. Could you be a bit less noisy? This is my beret. Do we really have to listen this? If you had seen "The Alamo", you would understand. That's psychological, before the attack. That gets on their nerves. - Not only them. You'll take the guard with me. You, until 3. Marit?, from 3 to 7. And the artist at the end. Are you giving me orders? - Get out of here! - Out! How do you think this is gonna end? You'll give up. You'll negotiate with Albert Roza. Or we'll have to ice them all. - It's not possible. - Yes, it is. And if it's them... That's also possible. We can possibly be all dead tomorrow. It's maybe our last night. Did you ever think about what you'd do if you only had two hours to live left? Principles are important, but once underground... Admit you'll feel sorry. About what? The universal school. I'm not kidding. Die like this would be silly. That's why I prefer the first solution. You gun down them all. Take a break, catch your breath. That's annoying, that's true! I never could stand the country. It's full of useless stuff. And you bore. - I never bore. Because I think. And do you know about what? Kids. - You think about chicks? - What would I do with a chick? I'm thinking about the kids, the brats. The one who lay his hand on them will lay his hand on the rest. Nabbing the mother, plunging her in the bath tube, that's just how we do business. Even if we ice her, that's only business. But nabbing her kid, you're really evil. You see... That's the condemned to death time. You're no fun. I'm realistic! It's maybe our last morning. That's too silly, we should enjoy our time. We'll feel less sorry. Don't lose your time, I'm not a morning girl. You should had set up the spells of duty another way. You girls are really passionate! At least, the other one runs on memories, but you? Huh? Without being inquisitive, who's your kid from? From me. Where are the feeding-bottles? In the kitchen. We could maybe open the shutters. And keep quiet! Catherine, come back in... Grenade! And I'm supposed to be evil? Who's gonna make coffee? I guess we're withdrawing. You know that, a front attack, when you don't have air support... I'm okay to make the coffee, but we need water. There's none left. There's none left. We're out of water.. What about the coffee? Give the bottle to Pierre. - And you? I'll manage. I'm a wreck if I don't have my coffee. Don't go out before I tell you to. I'll whistle. Stop and don't move! Stop! Understand? Come! - Hurry up! - Coming... Oh... That wasn't necessary... You should had not, really... One more. One less. Albert, it's about time to find a solution. And quickly. I have one. But you don't like it. We're maybe heading to a heart-rending revision. I'm watching... There's nothing. Absolutely nothing. There's nothing. Everything is fine, there's nothing. They're sleeping. They're really tailor-made. You acted like a man so let's have a man talk. I suggest that we have a final look. Everywhere. Under the roof, in the well, everywhere. And if we find nothing, we split. I don't want to leave anymore. Never again. Let me tell you something. For this dough, I would have kill. I would have done anything. But now, I don't give a damn. Not me. I don't need 200 million to do the house up and raise my kid. - Especially with me around. - Bravo, I love it. Keep the daydreaming for after I left. In the meanwhile, let's get back to work. I may save you some useless search. You're not gonna find the money in the well. They're at my place. You're high temperature again, maestro. What does it mean? It means the portrait of president Lincoln. The written amount is excessive for that kind of printing quality. Pierrot robbed by a jerk? How did you find the money? M. Lhomond... I mean Pierrot, entrust it to me. Against my word. Word or not, you'd better talk. And quickly. Two facts allow me to do so. First: apparently our friend had an accident. Second: I think I understood that the money wasn't the fruit of an exemplary work. Where is it? Can I? Yes. In the big jar, on my terrace. - Don't go! - Sure, I'm going! And let me warn you: the one who'll do nothing will have nothing. So? You come or you stay? We stay. So long, losers! You'll be more useful upstairs. They nabbed... the small brats. Marit?! The children... Make them be quiet! I do the best I can! Here's my little Cathy... A neighbour's visit? If you want to make peace, drop your needle, it brings back some bad memories. I could feel offended. Stop where you are. Don't come closer. Turn around. Hands up, cunt! I slowly raise my arms, I move my left foot forward... No, it's not the left. Hands up, bitch! And drop your gun. Hear me? You're done. Why can't I remember of what he said? What's the next move? I step the right foot and turn? Don't move! Drop your gun! Oh, yes, on the right, otherwise I fall down. On the right! My darlings! My son... My love. I love you. My darling. It's mummy. That's how I said it, superintendent. This... This gentleman killed that gentleman. Here! This gentleman... killed that two gentlemen. - Exactly! - Exactly... And the man would had left tracks like this behind him? To find his way back, I guess? And according to you, he would had gun down the other tree? - Yeah. With a riffle? - Exactly. A shotgun, probably? You'd came a month later and the figs would have been mature. It's a pity, we had a cold winter... - But lavender... - Enough! There's another possibility that would get the sympathy of the jury. I was with Miss Aigroz when she discovered the kidnapping. She passed out yelling "Children!" You'll testify before an investigating judge. The mother that passed out. That's good. That's very good. But I wouldn't keep the "Children!" She passed out. Period. Huh? - Yes, I think. A settling of scores? That suits everybody, so why bother? A friend is here to see mummy. Since you're using the expression "settling of scores", Can I remind you... As I thought about it. Is there still a reward? Provided that you find the bundle. Marit?. I'll take care of Pierre. Come. The dough is here, in the jar. Wait! Can I do it? - Go ahead. Here you go. Excuse me, we have no nanny yet. If it's allow to bring a conclusion, we'll say that it's certain that the climate in the south of la Loire, neither too wet nor too dry, perfectly fits for the blooming of the mothers.
