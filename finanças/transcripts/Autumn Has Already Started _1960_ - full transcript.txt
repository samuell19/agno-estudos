Autumn Has Already Started Toho Productions Autumn Has Already Started Producer: Mikio Naruse Screenplay: Ryozo Kasahara Starring Nobuko Otowa Yosuke Natsuki Chisako Hara Daisuke Kato, Seizaburo Kawazu Kenzaburo Osawa, Futaba Ichiki Director: Mikio Naruse Lively here, isn't it? Let's go before we get lost. Look Out! Hideo. This is where I graduated from long ago. You'll study here when summer vacation is over. - It's big like the Nagano Capitol. - It sure is. You have to study hard to keep up with the kids in Tokyo. I will. I like to study. Let's go. Your uncle's home is close by. You shouldn't stare at someone that way. But she was acting strangely. She's on her way to dance lessons. Let's go. This way. Thank you very much. - Good afternoon. - Welcome. Shigeko, you're here! It's been a long time. It's been awhile, Aunt. My, you're Shotaro, aren't you? Yes, I am. You've really grown. I didn't recognize you. Is he Hideo? Hideo, say hello to them. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. And to your aunt. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Come in. Oh, you're here early. Good afternoon. - Was the train crowded? - No, it wasn't. Now that it's summer, many people visit the mountains, but fewer come to Tokyo. Brother, thank you for everything. Coming from Nagano, you must really feel the heat in Tokyo. In Nagano we can cool off in the shade when it's hot. You have to get used to the heat, since you'll be a Tokyoite. Hideo, say hello to your uncle, too. Good afternoon. Please look after me. Don't mention it. You've taught him well. Have you two eaten lunch? We ate some musubi on the train. I'm always the last to eat lunch. How about some ice cream? There's a cold watermelon in the refrigerator. Our store's leftover fruit, right? But you said it's a waste to throw them away. Your boxes arrived yesterday. They're on the second floor. Thank you. Harue. Hideo and your aunt from Nagano are here. Good afternoon! Do you remember me, Harue? Sort of. But I'm not sure. Speak more politely to your aunt. Can you watch the store for a while? Shotaro went out on delivery. Alright. My day off and I can't have it for myself. - What grade are you in? - 6th grade. My, are you tall! My daughter's such a problem. I wish she would help at our store. But she doesn't like our work. Does she work now? Yes, at a department store ever since she finished high school. Young people often choose that line of work. Hideo, how about a slice of watermelon? Okay. - How about you? - Thank you. What's that? He loves those bugs. I can't stand them. Thank you. Hey, Riki, eat it. It's a watermelon. Oh, how creepy. We can't do anything about it. Have you told him about your job? Not yet. What will you do? The Mishima Ryokan is short-handed. They want you to begin as soon as possible. That's fine. I'll tell him later. Then I'll take you there tonight when it gets cooler. Please do. Why not go for a bath now? You will feel refreshed. Good afternoon. - That's all. - Okay. How much is it? How about taking a bath with me? No way! I won't take a bath with women. Alright. I'll try to take a quick bath. Ready? Set... Go! Go! Don't lose! Pass him! Go! You can't go in! We're having an Olympic event. Where are you from? Ueda. Ueda? Where is Ueda? In Nagano. He's a country hillbilly! He talks funny. I will fight the Harimao figure! What are you doing that for! Stick 'em up! Bam! Why'd you do that! Go get him! The kids are so noisy. Where's the watchman? I have a splitting headache. I couldn't sleep much last night. Quiet down! Still hurts? A little. Hideo, you shouldn't fight with those mean boys. But they started shooting me with water pistols. They are such bad boys. Feel better now? I feel better. It would be terrible if you get an ear infection. It doesn't hurt anymore. Hideo, I haven't told you, but... I will move to another place and work there from today. But you said you'll always stay here. I only meant that you will stay here. This place is too small. I would be a bother to your uncle. Without money, I can't buy clothing or schoolbooks for you. We can't depend on your uncle for everything. Oh. You should know. You worked as newsboy in Ueda. Don't play around. Do what the family says. You have to help out at the store, too. Mom, where you will live? At a ryokan nearby. Ryokan? It's close enough that you can come to see me anytime. - You understand? - I guess so. My husband worked in the transportation section of a fabric manufacturer. When did he pass away? This past March, in the hospital. Tuberculosis is serious. Many people do not get better even after several years of treatment. It really is serious when your husband gets tuberculosis. So I guess you're fine? As we are in the service business, we can't have guests catch a disease from you. I am healthy. I had several check-ups while my husband was in the hospital. Fine. I was just a bit worried. Since you were born in Tokyo and lived here until marriage, I will ask you to host a guest on your first day. I couldn't let a girl from the countryside do the same. Unlike me, she's a true native of Tokyo. Can you start from today? I appreciate this opportunity. What's this? Unsold pumpkins again! I boiled the part we can still eat. It may be thrifty to eat old veggies. But we'll get sick if we eat the same food every day. You needn't worry. You can always eat lunch at your dept. Store's cafeteria. Complain to your father, not me. Even if vegetables are cheap, he shouldn't buy so many. This is a bad location for a produce store. Buildings keep going up and fewer residents stay. And customers here are stingy and picky. The price of land here goes for 3 to 400,000 yen per tsubo (3.3 mÂ²). You're better off selling this house now. Talk is cheap. We've had this business since your grandfather's day. - You're behind the times. - You sure are. Be quiet. Hey, a customer is here. Always making me work... Welcome. Where will the kid sleep tonight? Anywhere. Let him sleep next to you. No way! I don't want to sleep next to a boy. What're you thinking? He's just a kid. You have a wild imagination. Don't be silly. I feel hot and stuffy when someone sleeps next to me. Hideo, you can sleep in my room on the third floor. You stay out late and don't sleep much anyway. Cut it out. You two always fight when you're together. Thank you for dinner. Only one bowl of rice? A growing boy must eat more. But I'm full. No one can eat such bad food. Still complaining? I've never seen you here before. When did you start? Today. Today? So you are hot off the press. You must have worked at a ryokan or a hotel before. No. It's my first time. I lived in the countryside for a long time. Really? You look like a woman of the world. You really do. What's your name? Shige. Shige... You're Oshige. I'm sorry I didn't notice. Where are you from? My store is in Kobe. But I visit Tokyo 3 or 4 times a month on behalf of the president. On business? Yes. Can you guess what business I'm in? Ireally don't know. Clear some space. My job is... take a look. Pearls! Are these all genuine? Of course. I just came from a trade show in Atami. They are beautiful. How much is one pearl? A lustrous, pink pearl such as this is rated the highest. This large one goes for about 50,000 yen. 50,000 yen! Have a glass with me. I can't drink alcohol. Just one glass of beer wouldn't hurt. I can't, not even a little drop. Thank you for waiting. How gorgeous. May I take a look? So beautiful! You plan to buy some? Of course not. He is only showing them to me. Is that so? Mr. Tomioka has never shown them to me. You're mean. Well, I... All right. This busybody will now leave. She always makes me uncomfortable. Riki, I will feed you some sugar water tomorrow. Ts ot Are you still awake? You're crying? You miss your mom? No Hideo, how about going for a drive? A drive? It's great fun. But first check downstairs if my dad went to the public bath. Isn't this fun? Yes. But I'm scared. It's your first time. But you'll get a thrill soon enough. I'll take you for a ride again. But you must help me with deliveries. 25 yen. Thank you. Eggplant 20 yen, cucumber 10 yen, and she gave me 50 yen. Change please. Let's go, Hideo. Thank you very much. Uncle, I'm going. The kid works hard. Yes. He is used to this work now. When did he come here? About 10 days ago. I delivered it. A nks You've already remembered our delivery locations. We made 12 deliveries. Only 2 more. They're across the streetcar line. So I'll take care of them. Take this and hang out before going home. My parents will make you work if you go home now. Thank you. You know how to play baseball? Of course. You can join our team. Let's go. Et s go Hurry up and cross the street! Get in! You know how to play the triangle base game, right? Don't When you hit a ball, you run straight to the home base. When you get out, you must change places. - What happens when I score? - You keep on hitting. Okay, got it. Let's choose the order. Paper. Scissors. Stone! Let's begin. - Ready? - Yeah. Strike! That was a ball. It was too high. It was a strike for sure. But it passed over my head, so it was a ball. It was a strike! Play on! I've warned you guys many times. I didn't do anything wrong. You can't fool me. Go now. Not that way! You want to see your mom, don't you? I do. I'll have you meet her. You will? I haven't told you, but the Mishima Ryokan is our customer. - That's where my mom is staying? - Yes. We already delivered to them today. But they ordered again. You go and deliver their order. Keep it a secret from my parents. I'm not supposed to tell you where your mom stays. They think you will bother her at work. So I shouldn't go. What're you saying? I know how you want to see her. Sho-chan, you never come around. It's too hot for mahjong. You've been unlucky lately. I guess so. You're off today? Yes. We're going swimming at the Korakuen park. I wish I could go with you. Give us a ride. But, I don't have my swim trunks. You can buy it on the way. - I 'll buy it for you. - No thanks. A sweet potato. Have one? No way! Hey, what did you do with Hiroshi's bat? Ah, I left it there. Go and get it. I'm busy now. You took it, didn't you? Of course not. Where is your place? The bat isn't there. Go and get it. Here you are. Thank you. Good afternoon. What do you want? I'm here from the Yaotsune store. I see. Thanks. These tomatoes are all bruised! Why'd you deliver such poor tomatoes to us! I'm sorry. Tell the owner, any more like these and... we'll stop ordering. Get us some better ones. You shouldn't scold him. I feel sorry for him. Some bad boys pushed him down and squashed the tomatoes. You don't have to take his side. You still here? Go now. Is Mom here? Mom? Whose mom? My Mom. Oh, the one from Yaotsune. So you're Oshige's son. You're Oshige's son. Can I call for her? No, you may not. Oshige is with a guest now. Then step inside. You can wait in my room. You don't have to invite him in. He can see her next time. It's okay. He can help me with my homework. Don't blame me if your mother scolds you. You're mean. Mother wouldn't get angry. Please come in. I didn't expect Oshige to have such a big boy. He might be in the 6th grade? Come over here, it's cooler. It's hot so you won't need a cushion, right? What's your name? Deo I'm Junko. What grade are you in? 6th grade. What about you? 4th grade. Can you show me how to do this? You have to do your own homework. Write it down and I'll redo it later. This is easy. Please do it, alright? Mother, Oshige's boy is here. Oshige's? Yes. Oshige is busy now, so he's waiting in my room. Is it okay? That's fine. - Can you give me some candy? - Sure I will. But you have to do your homework. I'm doing it now. Two more beers for the guests in the Matsu room. Oshige, your son is here. Oh? - I'm done. - Thank you. You didn't do any arithmetic problems. I hate arithmetic! Here. Did you have fun at the marine school? Lots of fun. I was in Zushi for two days. I turned red as a lobster. A crab pinched your toe? Aha, you read my diary. But you wrote it in the notebook. I love the ocean. I want to go and see it. You've never been to the ocean? I've seen it in movies and on tv. The place I grew up is surrounded by mountains. Is he your father? Yes. He looks pretty old. No, my mother says he looks young for his age. Is he home now? No. He stays here once in a while. Once in a while? His main home is in Osaka. What's a main home? Amain home is... a main home. My father has two wives. So he lives in two separate places? No, not really separate. But it's better than not having a father. Yes. He is a kind father. What about yours? He died. You don't have a father? No. I cried a lot when my grandma died. Did you cry, too? I didn't cry. Weren't you sad? I still have my mom. Junko, these are from your mother. Hideo did my homework. Is that so? Hideo, you shouldn't bother them. Go home now. The store must need your help. Mom, when's the next time I can see you? I'll let you know when I have a day off. Please take me to the ocean. The ocean? I wish I had the time. Don't you think something's going on between Mr. Tomioka and Oshige? Couldn't be. Whenever he arrives, she suddenly grows nervous and puts on makeup. Something's fishy. I think they are seeing each other. I doubt it. Her son lives nearby. You never know. Oshige is still in her prime. She wants a man. She wants a man... She's been here but 10 days, and has already taken a day off. Please take care of it. Thanks. More iced tea, please. It's in the refrigerator. - Your laundry? - Yeah. Ts ot Let's take a trip to Hakone tomorrow. A one-day trip. But I've already taken a day off. Why not go? Make up an excuse. I think the staff is aware of us. Really? I feel uneasy working here now. Mr. Tomioka. I won't ask you to marry me. But please continue to offer me advice. Of course. Don't worry. Hideo. Can I take you to see the ocean? You will? We can see it nearby. Wait at the park next Saturday, just past noon. The park? The park where you got into a fight. - Be sure to go. - Okay. We have to go higher up. Can you see it? That's the ocean. The ocean? Yes, it is. You can see the ships. It's not blue at all. And there are no waves. We can't see its blue color from here. We have to go close. I want see the ocean up close. Let's go next time. I have some shopping to do. Let's go back down. I have to submit insect specimens to the teacher. Insects? I forgot to do it. So I'll buy the insects here. How about a helmet beetle? Any insect is ok. Even a helmet beetle or a dragonfly. Show me a box of insect specimens, please. Certainly. Don't buy it. What's the matter? I have a live helmet beetle. It's alive? His name is Riki. He's huge. Sounds strong. I'll lend it to you. But I have to show it to the teacher. You can ask for it back afterwards. Feed sugared water and he'll live for a long time. But wouldn't a beetle bite me? No, he won't bite. He just raises his antennae when he gets angry. Please lend him to me. Alright. I'll bring him next time. Thank you for waiting. Your change is 325 yen. Thank you very much. - How about we listen to jazz after work? - Sounds great. That jazz spot plays the new release of Heartbreak's. See you later. Hideo. Hi Sis. Were you separated from your mother? Is she here? You weren't with her? No. I came with this girl. What a surprise! Already dating at your age. Where did she go? She just left the store. That way? See you next time. Hey girl, who are your parents? Mom! Oh, it's you. What are you doing here? I'm here with a guest. Buy some candies with this. I'm sorry. This one looks good. I'll take it. And this... Welcome. You're late. Where did you go? Fold the clothes hanging on the line, please. Riki, where are you? Where did you go? Riki! Riki! Riki! What's going on? You're making a mess of things. Riki has disappeared. Riki? You make a fuss over one helmet beetle? But there aren't any helmet beetles in Tokyo. That's not true. Tokyo is huge. We'll catch one if we look. Where? You're asking me? Where would a helmet beetle live? They eat the sap off chestnut or oak trees. They must live in a grove. All right. I'll take you there on my next day off. But there are no groves around here. Don't worry. I know a place. Hideo, I'll go swimming here. You look for some helmet beetles. Okay. Hey, what did you just take? Nothing yet. These pears are for sale. You'll be a thief if you take one. Helmet beetles are free. Why you! Ah! Hey! What are you doing with my coat? I'm just here to catch helmet beetles. Silly boy, this is my broach. What a fool. Did you catch any? There aren't any helmet beetles in Tokyo. That's alright. I'll take you to another place later. I'm home. Where'd you go? Tamagawa River. Did you eat dinner? We did. We stopped at a beer hall. You drank beer? Don't drink and drive. You could get hurt. You're kidding. Two glasses of beer won't cause an accident. That's what you think. We've got a problem. What's the matter? Mrs. Mishima called about Shigeko? Shigeko went out yesterday and still hasn't returned to the ryokan. Eh? Are you sure? The cook thinks she had an affair with a guest and ran off with him. She wouldn't run away and leave Hideo here alone. But she actually did. There's good reason to believe so. What happened to my mom? Your mom left you here and ran off somewhere. Enough. That's not true! Never mind. Go to the public bath with Shotaro. I'll explain later. Et s go What a problem. Maybe we should report this to the police. Amissing person report? Let's not get carried away. The neighbors will gossip. And Harue has yet to marry. This may affect her chances. Shigeko is real trouble. Hideo, let's go. Here. Take it. Thanks. Sorry about the helmet beetle. I'll get it for sure on my next day off. When is your next day off? The 30th. So it will be in time for school. No problem. By the way, your mom is terrible. You must feel sad. I'm not sad. Are you lonely? No, I'm not. I'm sure Mom will come back. But the cook said that middle-aged women are scary. Your mom is a middle-aged woman, isn't she? I don't know. I'm sure she is. When middle-aged women fall madly in love, they even forget about their children, she says. The cook knows everything. I think your mom forgot about you, too. It's a lie. It's a lie! Are you angry? No, I'm not. But you suddenly ran away. Won't you come to my place and play? I can't. I still have a delivery. Why don't you quit delivering? But my aunt will scold me. Please come to my home and become my brother. Your brother? I'll ask my mother. You can't do that. Don't worry. My mom listens to everything I say. Let's go, Hideo! Your aunt ran off with a guest? I admire her. We should fall in love the way she does. How foolish. If they were smart about it, they could've had a lot more fun. You're right. What will you do after graduation next year? I'll work for a suitable company. What do you mean by suitable? It's best to stick with the strongest. I'll avoid the smaller companies. Salary, bonus, retirement package, and promotions... I look into each of these. But can you pass the company employment exam? No problem. This year there are more positions available than job seekers. But you joined a protest at the Capitol. I think you'd be a marked man. No problem. I didn't do anything to get caught. Oh? Wait here for a little while. Mother. Where did you go, Junko? I went to the department store with Hideo. I've been waiting for you. Please change your clothes. Where will we go? Your father has come back. He did? So we will have dinner together. Yay! It's 4 o'clock. We have to hurry. Mother. I have a favor to ask. What is it? Please make Hideo my brother. What was that? His mother has disappeared. And I don't have any brother. So you want him stay here? Yes. Please make him my brother. What a silly idea. Couldn't you? No, I can't. Why? Because he is not related to us. He belongs to another family. And he is a child of that loose woman. What does loose mean? Never mind. Hurry up and change. Can't you say yes, mother? First of all, your father would never accept it. So it's okay if father says yes? He won't say yes. Where are you going? I'm going tell Hideo what you said. She said I have to ask my father. I'm going home. I'm sorry. I'll tell you next time. Wait, kid. I have something for you. I found this in your mother's closet. Take it. What is it? I'm sure your mom asked the nice man to buy this for you. A baseball glove. Who is this nice man? Just a man. Here you go. What's the matter? Deo Here you are. 10 yen of change. Thank you very much. What does Shige have to say? Where is she now? She's working as a maid at a ryokan in Atami. What a selfish woman! She wrote that she will send some money so please take good care of Hideo. She shouldn't have asked for our help if she's going to do this. She treats us poorly. I hate to say this, but... I know. Even if Shigeko returns, she'll never step foot in our home again. What's that? This way, please. Your guests have arrived. Father! Junko! You're here! You're not alone? Hatsuko and Keiichi are here. They wanted me to take them sightseeing in Tokyo. You should have told me. This is a good chance for them to meet Junko. Yes, but... How is your wife? She's fine. She said to thank you for the gift. Mother, who are they? Your older brother and sister. My brother and sister? From the main home? Hatsuko, Keiichi, please get along with Junko. Hatsuko and Keiichi, I hope you will treat her well. Father, let's have dinner soon, then go to Ginza. I'm hungry, too. Please wait. We will eat dinner together. Sorry to have kept you waiting. Hatsuko asked me to buy her a purse in Ginza. I'll help you pick one out. No thanks. I'll find one myself. Father. I have a favor to ask you. What is it? I would like one more brother in Tokyo. Huh? One more? Junko, didn't I tell you? You mustn't bother your father with such a request. But I feel so sorry for Hideo. Who is Hideo? Don't mind her. Father, please let him stay with us. Behave yourself! I don't know what you're talking about. I'm going out to see the carps in the pond. I'll go, too. Why don't you join them? You can see many big carps. Have fun. By the way, about your ryokan, Why don't you sell it and buy a condo in suburbs? It's too early to consider. We've had an increase in bookings at the ryokan. Actually, someone is interested in buying the ryokan at a good price. With you, everything has a price. The ryokan business is all I know. Anyhow, please let me think it over. I couldn't offer you a place to stay in Tokyo if I bought a condo. You could buy a small house instead. That isn't economical. Mother. I'm discussing something important with your father. Please stay out in the garden. Your order. Why didn't Father come home with us? He is busy with work. He took those kids somewhere, didn't he? I wouldn't know. Stepping out? Yes. Take care. Why are those kids my brother and sister? They just are. We can't change that. Hideo is much better. Why does Father have two wives? Please tell me. You'll understand when you grow older. So don't let it bother you now. No, I can understand now, so tell me. Quiet! I'll get angry with you if you keep this up. But... Be quiet! Mother, you like those kids more than me. Junko! What happened? Hideo, you can't become my brother after all. I have a brother and sister, but we don't have the same mother. My mother scolded me when I asked why. I hate my mother. I hate my mother, too. I don't want to go home. Want to go to the department store? No. Let's go someplace farther. Farther? To the ocean. Will you go? The ocean? Mister. Miss Mishima. Good afternoon. Where is the nearest ocean? The ocean? Yes. The Harumi waterfront is closest. Well, could you drive us there? Only you two? Yes. But did your mother say you could go there? Yes, she did. All right, please get in. Hideo. We're here. Shall I wait for you here? You may go back now. Can you find your way home? No problem. Please send the bill to my home. Understood. What a big ship! I can't see the ocean clearly. You're right. Let's try from over there. Okay. The water isn't very blue. It's kind of yellowish. I wanted to see a cleaner ocean. Shall we go over there? It's so wide here. This area is a landfill. It's big enough to play baseball here. But this place will be filled with buildings. Really? Yes. Then, all of this dirt will disappear. What are they chasing? They are catching dragonflies. I see. Around here they are tiny. Were there big dragonflies in your hometown? Of course. Big like this. Hideo, you want to go back to the countryside, don't you? No, I don't. My mom isn't there. It's the same anywhere. I wish I could live in the countryside. Why? Because the school's playground is covered with dirt. Ts We wouldn't get hurt when we fall down, not like concrete. The air is clean, and the rivers are so clear you can see to the bottom. Tokyo still has a river like that, the Tamagawa-river. But the river in our neighborhood looks like a dirty gutter. That's right. It stinks. I can't eat after I get a whiff of the smell. I don't want to go home anymore. Me neither. I want to go home now. I'm starving. Hideo, school will begin soon. Can you still get a helmet beetle? No problem. My day off is at the end of the month. I'll catch it then. Please do. I will. Shall we go home now? A grasshopper! I wonder if you can catch it. I'll catch it for you. What happened? Did you hurt yourself? Has Junko returned? Not yet. I wonder what happened? Any luck? Anything new? She didn't visit Michio or Kazuko today. I see. It would be terrible if this were like the Masaki-chan kidnapping. Don't scare us. The produce boy hasn't returned either. I'm certain he's out with her. I will call the police. A guest upstairs is calling. Coming. Even now we must wait on guests. What a problem. The Mishima Ryokan has called several times. Their daughter hasn't come home either. Hideo wouldn't imitate his mother after she ran off with a guest. He's probably out watching a samurai movie. He couldn't go to a movie theater by himself. He can. I took him there once. Kids today are smart. Oh yeah? Harue is late, too. She comes home late every night. I wonder what she's doing. She may have a boyfriend. I won't allow it. You don't have to get angry at me. Hideo, please be sure to bring me a helmet beetle. Sure. Goodbye. Goodbye. Excuse me. Junko! Are you her mother? She was at the landfill in Shinonome. A construction worker found her and called us. She is very tired. Thank you very much. I am very sorry to cause trouble. Where did you go? We were so worried about you. You must be relieved. Come with me. Why did you go to such a far place? The boy from the produce store asked you, right? Say something! I won't scold you again. But you will not play with that boy any more. No way! You must be hungry. We made your favorite omelet for you. I see. I am very sorry to have caused trouble. - Well, then. - Thank you. Nothing happened. Thank you very much. Does it still hurt? You must be hungry. - Why you! - Stop it! You made us worry. Nothing but troublemakers, you and your mother. Enough Dad. He's home now. And he's hurt. You had to get help from the police to return home. None of our family has ever troubled the police. But he's lucky he could ride in a police car. Don't interrupt your father while he's scolding Hideo. I have to make sure he's learned his lesson. Hey, bring another bottle of beer. You need a beer when scolding a kid? Never mind and bring it here. I'm home. Harue, where do you go late every night? What does it matter where I go? I'm not causing you any trouble. Talking back again. Dear, please give her a good scolding, too. I've had enough of his preaching. Beer and fish again. I won't have any of it. Don't talk back to your parents. No respect. Does it still hurt? No. My dad scolded you because my mom was standing there. Don't feel bad. When he dies and I become the store owner, I'll sell this place and open a big produce store in the suburbs. Then you can be my assistant. Shotaro, Yeah? Can you take me to catch a helmet beetle on our day off this month? A helmet beetle again? What's so good about that bug? Ireally want to get it. Could you please take me? Alright. But will your leg heal by then? I'm sure it will. Okay. Umm... helmet beetles, where can we catch helmet beetles? Thick woods or groves.
