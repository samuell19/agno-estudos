Thank you. - Here you go. - Ah, thank you, binny. That man takes the longest lunch hours I've ever known. I think he said he was taking a client to lunch. I wonder what he was really having for lunch, if you catch my drift. You know, honey, I'm sure you have some bright ideas on some subjects, but what your boss does at lunch isn't one of them. I hired you to file that stack of forms on your desk, not those nails of yours. Catch my drift ? Whatever. Oh, I could really use a drink. You want to do the honors ? What about your day ? What'd you do for dinner ? Missy had some of her friends from school over here again. Smoking pot. Doing lord knows what else. House smelled like the Marrakesh express when I came home. It's not like you were Johnny appleseed in high school. No, I wasn't. That'd be a pretty good nickname for that boyfriend of hers. I have a feeling he left some of his around here. Oh, that's sick. You'd never talk like that if she were your daughter. You know... I'm not going to sit here and hear you crucify her. Get me the 11/16, son. Okay. Here, dad. Get me a beer. Dad wants a beer. Shit... I mean, shoot. We're out. You are so dead. He's gonna throw a shit-fit. - Don't talk like that. - Sorry. Can you tell him, mom ? Sure, honey, I'll tell him. Thanks. Mom forgot to get the beer. Honey, I'll run out and get some right now, okay ? I'll be back before you even know it. How's that happen ? What good does that do ? I want one now. Ow ! Let's go, Jesse. Get my beer. Don't you dare... do what ? Huh ? Come on, boy. I'm thirsty. - What happened, Holly ? - What do you mean ? Your lip, Holly. It looks like rocky marciano's. Allergic reaction. That's what I get for buying fruit out of season. I'm guessing it's the season for hitting wives. It's not like that. Look, you and Jesse can stay with me till you get on your feet. Thanks, but I can handle it myself. I thought I could too. - Good morning, ladies. - Morning. Where's Brenda ? Late. Again ? Do you want me to talk to her ? I'll take care of it. All right, tell her it's the last time. I mean it, binny. Can't have this. - How are you doing this morning, Holly ? - I'm fine. I need to talk to you, Brenda. What ? Out in the hall. What did I do now ? Let's go. Come on. This is so unfair. Oh, here it is. Right there. $40,000 ? You got to be kidding me. I told you this was the year we were going to have to pay the Piper. We were going to have to pay ? You have an extra $40,000 lying around ? 'Cause I sure as hell don't. You know as well as anybody how tight it's been around here. Listen, I warned you to put some cash into something. I sat right here in this chair and I told you this day was going to come. Oh, hutch. Have you thought about letting somebody go ? You could save some payroll. Binny's been with me since day one, and Holly's a big hit with the customers. What about the... you know, the other one ? Firing Brenda's big tits ain't going to get me 40 grand. What about Rachel ? Can she help ? No. Rachel sinks most of her salary into missy's college fund. You have any idea how much it takes to send a kid to college these days ? Oh, listen, I got two kids at state. I know. It's a bitch. Besides, we're not getting along real well. - Oh, well... - well... i... I'll see ya. What the hell happened to you ? Oh, forgot to take my smart pill. I walked into a cotton backhand. Jesus Christ. I am losing my touch. I can usually anticipate the blow. But what threw me for a loop this time, he was sober. What a coward. I am right on the edge, hutch. I swear I'm going to kill him the next time he lays a hand on me. All right. Leave him tonight. And lose my son ? You can do it. There are places where you can go. He'll find me, and he'll take Jesse. - Well, then, call the cops on him. - I did that once. And when the cops came, cotton asked Jesse in front of them... If he had hit me, Jesse said no. Geez. Your own son ? He's poisoned him. Tell me what I can do. You can help me kill him. Have you flipped your lid ? We can do it. I figured it all out this afternoon. Holly, listen, please. You know I'm in your corner on this, don't you ? What he's doing to you is awful. But killing him ? Y-You've got to control your emotions. I've never had my emotions more under control. I thought we had something special. You actually said that to me yesterday at the motel. But I've seen your true colors. They're yellow. It's over between US, hutch. I'm either going to find somebody to help me do this, or I'm going to do it myself. That's it. Holly... give my regards to Rachel. Asshole ! Mom, can I ask you a question ? What ? Do you love dad ? Of course I do. I'm glad. Yeah ? Can you give me the good-night kiss ? Oh ! The good-night kiss. You haven't asked for the good-night kiss in a really long time. Good night, mom. Good night, pumpkin. I love you. I love you. Good night. Yeah, he gets drunk and he slaps me around. But I never dreamed of killing him. But you wouldn't mind if he was dead ? I guess I wouldn't. Maybe in an accident. Maybe. And perhaps having a big insurance policy on his life... Wouldn't be such a bad idea. Maybe. Maybe then we could be together. And maybe then... what ? Ah, forget it. The invoice right now... let's see. It's dated the 17th, and... absolutely. Holly, could you bring in the Vincent file, please ? I want to discuss a couple of things. So how's things on the home front with cotton ? He's still alive. Only because he hasn't hit me. You're not still intent on killing him, are you ? If only that man knew he was living on borrowed time. Holly. Holly, just come to your senses. Normal people do not go around killing... Killing other people. Normal people don't go around hitting other people with impunity. - There's got to be another way to solve this. - No other way. Holly, I miss you. Forget it. I'm not screwing you anymore. - I think I'm ready to make the break with Rachel. - Bully for you. Is that all you have to say ? I'm fresh out of marriage counseling. Don't you understand what I'm saying ? No. What are you saying ? I'm going to be a free man. When I kill cotton, I'll be free too. You can buy me a drink. All right, listen, Holly. Listen. I could have a life with you. You could divorce cotton and we could be married. You'll divorce Rachel to be with me ? I've been giving it a lot of thought, and it's something i'd... Like to do. - If I get divorced, I'm sure to lose Jesse. - No. No way. I'll lose him one way or the other. I know that as sure as I'm sitting here. The only way to get rid of cotton and keep Jesse is to kill him. That is just crazy, Holly. I can do it. I can get away with it. There's a lot of money to be had too. Money ? What money ? What, insurance ? No. I could never talk cotton into life insurance. He thinks he'll live forever. Well, what then ? You told me you didn't have any money. No, I don't. But he's got something that's good as gold. - Oh, yeah ? - When his parents retired, they got a ranch in the San Luis valley. They passed away, cotton inherited the ranch. He rents it out to the rancher next door for a song. In the event of his death, I inherit the land. Really ? And what's that worth on the open market ? In the neighborhood of $400,000. Pretty nice neighborhood, huh ? So how are you going to get away with it ? Why should I tell you ? You already told me the guy's dead meat. Before I read about it in the newspapers, I'd like to hear how you're gonna do it. There's been two break-ins in my neighborhood in the last six weeks. Both of them in the middle of the night. Cotton's been sleeping with his gun, just waiting for someone to try our house. Charming. It's my plan... To have my accomplice make some noise outside our house... To rouse cotton out of bed. So then your dimwitted accomplice... Shoots the unsuspecting cotton and you're home free. No. I'll have my gun too. When he gets up, unbeknownst to him, I'll follow. I don't want anyone doing my dirty work for me. I don't want to miss out on the satisfaction of blowing that monster's shit away. You're going to kill him ? I've got it all planned out. Where to hide the gun, where to cap him. Everything. Where to cap him ? I can't believe this talk. That's 'cause you're gutless. Well, what about the small matter of your son, Jesse ? If he thinks as highly of cotton as you say, you'll need a child psychologist on retainer. It's going to be hard for a while, but we'll get through it. When we talked at the bar, you said you wanted my help. What would my role be in all of this ? Holly, I miss you. Forty thousand dollars ? You got to be kidding me ? I told you this was the year we were going to have to pay the Piper. There's a lot of money to be had too. Can I get together with you tonight ? Just break in, make some noise. I could have a life with you. Our future begins after cotton's dead. Hutch ? Hutch ? Hutch ? Have you heard a thing I've said ? Yeah. Yeah, get those discounts. Where has your head been lately ? Did you have a hard sleep last night ? No, it was easy. Why don't we break for lunch ? Well, it's, uh, 10:15. Oh. Well, let's finish then. Say, who's that guy at the department of records, funny nose, we used him once ? He's a whiz at wills and, uh, taxes, estate planning. He used to be a lawyer, but he was tossed off the bar. You mean Larry Skaggs ? - Yeah, that's him. - Larry loophole. Right. Right. I want to talk to him. - How come ? - Well, i... I got a, uh, a call this morning... From an old client of mine, had a question I couldn't answer. She has an elderly aunt... Living in a nursing home. Something about property taxes... Vis-a-vis life insurance... And, uh, how it would affect her income tax. And that stuff is just out of my depth. Be careful around him. He's about one brainstorm away from doing serious time. Hi. Hutch rimes, hutch rimes insurance. Oh, yeah. I've seen your ads. Thank you. Uh, a client of mine owns some land up in the San Luis valley, and he wants me to do some research... Into his water and mineral rightn for insurance purposes. So I'd like to speak to Larry Skaggs, please. What are you doing now ? What's that ? Just a letter I wrote to my mother. Come to bed. Okay. Mm. Did you hear something ? Somebody's in the house. Are you sure ? We'll see. Don't go out there. Got a plane to catch, big boy ? I'm meeting Marvin whetstone in 20 minutes. What's Marvin whetstone got that I haven't got ? Well, he's got a company with 40 employees, all of whom need insurance. Hmm. Is that all ? Well, Marvin whetstone is one of my loyalest clients. Say, is that a word, "loyalest" ? Or is it a political party ? I got your party right here, buster. Drop off the key, okay ? Ah. Tied up whetstone for another year. That's wonderful. Who do you tie up next ? Can I talk to you, hutch ? Sure. Come in. What's going on ? Why the gloom and doom ? While you were at lunch, someone called. Oh ? Who ? Cotton proudfit. Cotton proudfit called here ? Yes. - I thought he was in prison. - Not anymore. What did he want ? He said he wanted to talk. About what ? He didn't say. Well, what... what could he possibly want with me ? Maybe he wants to talk about Holly. Talk about Holly ? Sh... she died 10 years ago. Well, she used to work here. That was a long time ago. - Yes, it was. - I-I just don't get it. What would a man convicted of manslaughter want with me ? He wanted to know what time you knocked off work. And when did you tell him ? 5:30. - Is he coming here ? - He said "much obliged" and hung up. Huh. Cotton proudfit. Charlie hightower called. He wants to go over his policy. I'm meeting him for drinks. See you tomorrow. Seventeen years and I know what it's like... To worry about losing it all. But I can sleep easy and you can too. Whatever your insurance needs, health, life, or business, call me, hutch rimes, and sleep easy. Oh, god ! Cotton proudfit. Hey, boss. Cotton ? Yeah. I missed you at work. You get my message ? Yeah. I, uh, had a meeting, uh, downtown. Oh, yeah. Is that one of those good ol' boy Martini meetings ? Mind if I come in ? Got a bone to pick with you. Sure. Come on in. I see you got my letter. Yeah. Just got it, uh, today. What I wrote in that letter is what I want to talk about. You mind if I sit down, boss ? No. Go... go right ahead. Have a seat. We don't stand on ceremony around here. Oh. I picked that up from an Eddie Murphy movie we seen in ordway. I never did get to see the end. Some old boy set the room on fire. Cleared out the cell block. This is a nice place you got here. Where's your better half ? We got divorced several years ago. You don't say. I met her a couple of times, I think. Kind of a baggy-eyed bitch, as I recall. You jousting that little thing I met in the office today ? I beg your pardon ? I was told, don't leave your meat where you get your bacon. There's a lot of truth to that. No, I-I don't, uh... I don't do that. Mm, I don't blame you. That sort of thing only gets you in trouble with boyfriends, husbands. That kind of shit was a no-no in the joint. Yes. So, what is it that you wanted to see me about ? I had a lot of time to contemplate in the stir. You know, take stock. For the longest time, I thought of my life as being over. My wife dead by my own hand. My beloved son... A memory. I guess you could say I was a bitter man. Was. Ten years inside softened me up. I got rid of my demons. How long can one man feel sorry for himself ? I don't know. Well, took me a long time. I was one angry motherfucker, let me tell you. Right. Can I get you something to drink ? Or, uh... now it's time to put my life in order. Tie up loose ends. That's where you come in. Me ? There's an accounting. An accounting of what you owed Holly when she died. Accounting ? Two weeks' work, one week vacation time. That's about $1,500. You figure in seven percent interest, which is fair. That comes to $3,850, including the interest. Uh, you came here for money ? Only what's owed Holly. Well, I guess in... in... in all the confusion back then, i... I must have forgot what Holly had coming. I could write you a check tonight if... Right now. That'd be good. How much was it again ? 3,850. How's your son ? He must be nearly grown by now, huh ? Yeah. I'm seeing him tomorrow. Oh. You know, I never got a chance to say this personally to the family, but I was real sorry about Holly. She was a great employee, and I considered her a friend. Thanks. She was a friendly girl. I loved her dearly. You know, I guess if anyone's to blame for this whole thing, it's the guy that broke into my house that night. Ended one life and ruined another. Thanks, rimes. Far as I'm concerned, we're square. Are you okay ? It was like this when I came in. Why would somebody do this ? Did cotton proudfit catch up with you ? He came to my house last night. Really ? What did he want ? Well, he wanted money... That I owed Holly when she was killed. What was he like ? Angry ? Demanding ? Violent ? No. None of the above. He was kind, and we had a very civil conversation. Could he have done this ? Why ? We've officed here for 17 years. The day cotton proudfit shows up, someone breaks in and trashes it ? Coincidence ? He was a gentleman who's doing his very best to get his life back together. Cotton proudfit a gentleman ? Since when does our prison system turn violent assholes into gentlemen ? How's my office look ? It's a mess. Okay, uh, go next door, use their phones... And report this to the police. - Lucky for me, I've got good insurance, huh ? - What about cotton ? Nothing about cotton. Let's just get this place back together and get open. Jesus Christ. - Jesse ? - Yeah ? Got time for lunch with your old man ? Hey, hey, hey. Is that any way to treat your father ? The spittin' image. What do you want ? We need to talk, son. We got 10 years to catch up on. I've got nothing to say. We've both got things to say to each other. We can say them now or we can say them later, but we're gonna say them. We can get them to you by late this afternoon. That would be great. Thank you. Well, good luck. - Did you tell him ? - Tell him what ? About cotton. What's there to tell ? That he was here yesterday and that he came to your house last night. Binny, ask yourself. Why would he wreck this office ? That's what I'd like that police detective to ask. Cotton's a criminal who murdered his wife. Which he maintained was a tragic accident. Bullshit ! He flipped out and shot her. There was history of abuse there. Look, I don't see the point of involving him in what amounts to a simple break-in. It's probably just some glue-sniffing punks with nothing better to do. Do you not want to implicate cotton proudfit in this... Because you're afraid you might open a can of worms ? What is that supposed to mean ? Can of worm... that's ridiculous. I don't know what you're talking about. Are we going ahead with the barbecue tonight ? Oh, shit ! I completely forgot. And we have clients coming too. - What do you think ? - It's up to you. Uh... well, let's do it. I think we can all use some beers tonight. Binny ? Forget about cotton proudfit. I got a good read on him last night. There's no reason for him to have a beef with me. I'm sure you're right. Oh, god, I missed my beer. - What are you going to do now ? - I got some plans you're a part of them. I got my own life. How's the job ? It pays the bills. You got a girlfriend ? Yeah. Well, what's her name ? Julie. Julie, huh ? Good for you. Ah, here we are. Ahh. I sent you a lot of letters. - So ? - You didn't write but once. I said all I had to say. I want to talk to you about that. What good would that do ? I know you loved your mother. And I loved her too. And you lost her and me at the same time. I know that was hard. But what happened that night... Was an accident. You hit her. You hurt her. Yes, I did. I did. That wasn't right. But I owned up to it. And I did not kill her out of rage or anything like that. I mistook her for the person who... who broke into our house. Jesse, I waited 10 years... To tell you that face-to-face, 'cause that's the truth. Now I can't change what happened. I can't bring her back. But I want you back. I want you to be my son again. I'm going to spell it out for you, all right ? I hate you. You killed my mother. ♪♪ Don't be antisocial, Dewey. Come join the party. I don't see why you and binny are doing all the work. He's just sitting there on his ass. He's the boss. Nobody schmoozes better than he does. That's 50 percent of our fiscal year sitting at that table. He's just doing his job. You're not even getting paid for this. My bonus last year paid for your motorboat. How much longer we got hang around this dump ? Or are you also on the cleanup crew ? No, darling. We're on the cleanup crew. Oh, thanks for all your help tonight, binny. It was, uh, tough duty, but it was good for business. I hope so. Good night, hutch. Good night, binny. Ohh. Hello, Olivia. Morning. Hey, do you think Dewey suspects anything about US ? Of course not. Why would you say such a thing ? He acts real strange every day. Yeah. He was giving me the eye all night. It's like... he didn't even come over to say hello to me or anything. You were kissing client butt all evening. Still, his attitude kind of bothers me. It's like there's something funny going on. Maybe... maybe you and I ought to just cool it for a while, huh ? Cool it ? What do you mean, break it off ? Did you meet someone new, is that it ? Don't I turn you on anymore ? Don't chickenshit me about Dewey finding out about US. That doesn't wash with me. Olivia, honey... don't honey me ! I know when i'm getting the brush-off. That's not it. I just think you and I need to... cool it for a while. Whatever. Asshole. Hey, binny. Where's Olivia ? She left for lunch. Did she know you were coming ? No. No. I just thought I'd surprise her. - Uh, is hutch here ? - He had a lunch appointment. - Did he now ? - Yes, he did now. Olivia said you got busted into the other night. I'd like to kill the Jack-off that did it. - Olivia said it was kids. - Maybe. Did you leave something here ? No. Then why don't you get your big nose out of her work. Just let Olivia know I dropped by to see her. I'll be sure to give her a full reporting of your activities. Have a good day. Coffee. Coming up. Julie ? Yes ? Hi. Do I know you ? Let me introduce myself. Cotton proudfit. Yeah, Jesse's old man. I won't bite. Another drink, binny ? Yeah. Put some scotch in it this time. Ah. May I join you ? Sure. Ah. Should we get a booth ? Yeah. Okay. Could I have a beer, please ? Sure. Thank you. So, what brings you to my cocktail office ? H-H-How long have you worked for me, binny ? Eighteen years, September 10. Wow. We have been together for a very long time. We have. Thick and thin. Yeah. We've been through a lot together, personally and professionally. Building the business. Your divorce. My divorce. Your daughter's illness. You picked a weird place to fire me. Oh... That... that's... ah, that's rich, binny. That's rich. No. I-I-I would never fire you. No. The problem is... I find myself in a quandary, and, uh, I'm in need of some advice. Oh. This said quandary named Dewey wise ? Yes, it is. How did you know that ? He came snooping around at lunch today looking for Olivia. Well, I was... I was having lunch with Gordon cowick. I think it's safe to say he knows you're screwing his wife. Well, that is the most unfounded... I know, hutch. I also knew about Jenny towers... And Micky hodle and Leslie gillis. And that was just 1991. For a while there, after you unceremoniously shit-canned Rachel, you couldn't tell the revolving broads without a scorecard. Huh. Was I that obvious ? You were fine. It was the girls who liked to talk. Wow. You must think I'm a first-class pervert. Hutch. You've always been good to me. And none of the women ever complained about you. They took it for what it was. My opinion of you has never changed. Well, that means a lot to me, binny. Dewey want a piece of you now ? I think it was Dewey trashed the office. Why him ? I got a couple of strange threatening type notes. One was on my car and the other was on my desk in my study at home. No, shit ! At your house ? What did they say ? Is my policy paid up and what kind of premium do I put on my life. That type of thing. Melodramatic, but effective. My... my neck is sore from checking my back. So what makes you think it was Dewey ? Well, one of the notes referred to me as... A Romeo. Y-You think cotton could have left the notes ? Cotton ? What for ? I knew about Holly too. You knew about Holly ? Yeah. - Did cotton know ? - I don't know. If he did know and he was holding a grudge all these years, why didn't he have it out with me the other night ? He could have crushed me with one hand tied behind his back. So he must not have known. Yeah, but what if he does ? I better go. Thanks for hearing me out. You've always been a real good friend, binny. And I suppose if you didn't see something in me, you'd have quit long ago. I saw something in you. Oh. God knows what. That you, honey ? Yep. Hi. Hi. What are you making, hmm ? That chicken dish you like. We having company or what ? Yeah. You want to get that ? Hi, son. You look surprised. There she is. Hi, Julie. Hi. I ran into cotton today and we made our introductions, and I invited him over for dinner. You ran into him ? Where ? At a halfway house ? Uh, you're not serving supper on the porch, are you ? No. I'm sorry. Come on in. Okay. Oh, something smells mighty good, Julie. Look at this. This is a nice little place you got here. Real nice. Oh, that's... that's nice. Well, what do you say we open that wine ? That sounds good to me. Okay. I'll go get some glasses. You got to her, didn't you ? Great gal. I can see she's got your best interests at heart. You got something we can crack this open with ? Here's some glasses. Here we go. Want me to open that for you ? Okay. Glass of wine, Jess ? Well, that wasn't so bad, was it ? Man, he has a lot of stories about you. You were quite the little pistol, weren't you ? Don't let his song and dance fool you. It's a con. He's a con. Jess, I know you have a lot of issues with him. Important issues. But... It's very clear that he loves you a lot. And he's reaching out to you. Don't you think it's time for some healing ? He killed my mother. He didn't mean to. Hutch in yet ? He went to get Danish. Oh, you look awful. Thanks. Oh, no, I wasn't being mean. It's just... are you sick ? Scotch flu. Yeah, I heard that's going around. - Something to do with the sheep over there. - Yeah. Dewey and I had a real donnybrook last night. - What'd you fight about ? - He accused me of having an affair... With hutch, no less. Is that right ? Have you ever heard such crap ? I'd have to think about it. Anyway, I'm moving out. Don't tell hutch. Oh, no. I wouldn't dream of it. Are you really serious about moving out ? You bet. I am tired of his jealousy. The nerve. A friend of mine just moved into a new building. If you like, I could take you over there. You could take a look. It's nice. That'd be great. Hi, hutch. Ah, what brings you here ? Don't worry. I made sure I wasn't followed. And just who would be following you ? I think we both know who would be. You mind if I come in ? I feel like a census taker out here. I left Dewey. Oh. Not on my account, I hope. You bastard ! Don't you have one ounce of compassion for me ? Take a mature attitude. We never had anything serious. It was a fling, nothing more. I would have never gotten involved with you... If I would have known what a heartless, save it for the drama league. Insensitive man you were. As I recall, it was you who initiated our harmless affair. You practically tore my clothes off that night at the office after work. You didn't put up much of a fight. You got me there. A fling ? A motel mama ? Is that all I am to you ? Just for your information, my husband knows about US. Tell me what it is you want me to do, Olivia. - Help me kill Dewey. - What ? Before he kills me... Or both of US. What do you mean kills both of US ? Dewey is insanely jealous. I know how his mind operates. Right or wrong, he believes I've been screwing you. He won't let it die until one of US does. Die, that is. Okay. Okay. Are you taking some medication I don't know about ? What you don't know about is my husband. On the surface, Dewey may appear... To be the geeky middle-manager that he is. But underneath that mild, open-mouthed exterior... Is one crazy, revengeful motherfucker. Now I wouldn't be surprised if he's already following you. Scaring you. Prepping you. I'm right, aren't I ? If I know Dewey, he's got every angle covered. He's dotted the t's and crossed the i's. He has figured out a foolproof way to get you. We have no choice but to kill him. Hutch ? Hutch ? Say something. You've got the wrong man. What do you mean ? It means find yourself another boy. You don't understand. Dewey will search you out and destroy you. Believe me, we've got to get him before he gets US. I got it all planned out. I don't want to hear it. We live in a nice neighborhood. Don't even try to tell me about some crime wave there. What crime wave ? Is it some fundamental flaw in my makeup... Or is it the type of woman I'm attracted to ? What woman ? Don't tell me you've lined up some new chick to take my place. Our bed's still warm, lover. I know you're in there, Olivia! I told you he wasn't fucking around. You got something of mine, rimes ! He's not whistling "Dixie." I'm coming in to get it ! Watch out for his up-and-under move. Every man's got a right to fight for his wife ! You alienated her affections for me ! Now I'm going to alienate you ! Oh, fuck ! - Where is she ? - Where's who ? My slut for a wife ! I don't know what you're talking about. She parked her damn car right out front, asshole ! Get out of my house now before I call the cops. You know, there's not a damn jury of my peers in the world... That would convict me ! Ohh ! Uhh ! I'll teach you to fuck with my wife. Motherfucker ! Are you out of your mind ? Now's our chance. We can finish him off ! Give me that ! You men are all alike. Cowards and pussies ! Pussies ? ♪♪ The place is all ours now. The renters had until last week to clear out. How many acres is it ? Four hundred prime cattle-raising acres. You got a course in raising cattle in prison ? Come on, Jess. I'm not gonna spend the whole weekend with a spoilsport. It's gonna be okay. This is hard for me to do, but sometimes... don't even think about firin' me, lover. Under the circumstances, I just don't think it would be... A good idea for you to continue to work here. You better rethink that, hutch. You're sitting on top of a big-time sexual harassment suit if you do something dumb. You wouldn't dare. I wouldn't, huh ? You asked me to kill your goddamn husband. You weren't wearing a wire, were you ? You unbelievable, blackmailing bitch ! I think we should steer the conversation toward a more civilized tone. All right. I'm gonna break your fucking neck ! Simmer down, big boy. Remember, I've seen you with your Johnson hangin' out, and it's hangin' out there pretty far right now. Let's get back to the lawsuit. I'll make you a deal. I promise I won't sue your butt and leave ya on the breadline, if you perform one little service for me. I will not kill your husband ! Don't compound your problems, honey. Now, you... sit down ! You need to contemplate two things. One, how you're gonna kill Dewey. And, two, if you don't, how your life's gonna be, once I've dragged your good name through the mud and taken you for all you're worth. While you're sorting out your options, I'm gonna take a leave of absence, full pay, to recover from the mental and emotional distress. You be sure to keep in touch... In the not-so-distant future. And watch your back for Dewey. He hasn't forgotten the lickin' you gave him. All the way down to that river over there, back to the hills there, Jesse used to like to play right over there. Thinking about this place kept me alive when I was in prison. This place and you. It's so peaceful out here. I could stay here forever. Why don't you ? Why don't you ? You two come live out here with me on the ranch. Julie, I can tell you're a great girl, and you're a great match for Jesse here. Wouldn't you like to be out here in this beauty every day ? You could be your own boss. We could make a go of it, be a family. We'd get away from the rat race. No more cell, no more workin' for the man. Hmph. Hey, is it too late to have my pecker cut off... So I can begin my new life as a woman ? Breasts aren't as much fun when they're your own. Olivia will deny everything if I go to the police. I mean, let's face it, binny. Either I kill Dewey, or I lose everything I've built up for the last 17 years. So I'm damned if I do and fucked if I don't. You don't have to lose what you've worked for all your life to that man-eating whore. I don't ? No. What should I do ? Kill Olivia instead ? Yes. Hey, hey. I think I better drive. No, no, no. Come here. Come on. Here you go. Okay. In you go. All that talk about killing Olivia... that was just booze talking. And I know that you're worried about your job, but I'm going to make sure that you're taken care of... In the event that... you know... Olivia should come after me. I'm gonna start stashing cash tomorrow. She's not going to get blood from this turnip. For all your affairs and lovers, you sure don't know women, hutch rimes. I don't give a hoot about money. What I do give a hoot about is you. You'll be surprised to know that I've loved you... Since the day you interviewed me for my job. Even after all this time, my heart still jumps out of my chest when you walk in every morning. Don't you think that's kind of ridiculous behavior... For a woman my age ? I swear to god, binny. I... I never knew. I know you didn't. I know. I was just part of the furniture, a comfortable old chair. Binny redwine, that's me. I don't... but I'll be damned if I'm going to let Olivia fucking wise ruin your life or mine. You can quote me on that. What do you want, grandma ? I was looking for Olivia. She didn't come in to work today. So that was you calling all morning. I was worried something had happened to her. What has happened to her is a wife stealer by the name of hutch rimes. Excuse me. Your beloved boss and my wife have shacked up. I didn't know that. She moved her stuff out yesterday while I was at work. That changes things, doesn't it ? You tell rimes for me I'm gonna settle his hash but good. Next time we meet, it's gonna be on a level-playing field, not in his booby-trapped house. I'll be sure and give him your warmest regards. This is what you're on the payroll for, Walter. You saved my ass ten years ago with the I.R.S. Now work your magic. Yeah, with help from Larry loophole, as I recall. You took a big chance there. Anyway, I think we got a way to go here. Most of your assets reside in the business. A howitzer could not pry away the shelters. That corporation you set up before you divorced Rachel... that protects your house. She can't touch that. Good. This little item right there... that's gonna be a problem. Well, this little item is the difference... Between whether I drive a Ford or a jag in my twilight years. Yeah. We could transfer ownership, just for the time being. You really think that's a good idea ? Yeah, sure, why not ? We could put it in... binny's name. We could transfer it back when the time comes. Yeah, but... no, no, no. That's good. What she doesn't know won't hurt her. Besides, it's binny. Dearest hutch, when everything is over, and we're together in one another's arms, in my house and not that awful motel, I will finally express to you my deepest love... And my deep appreciation for your commitment to me. You, as I, are risking everything. My thoughts and prayers are with you. We determine our own destiny. No matter what happens, know this. I love you with all my heart and all my soul. You showed me what a man can b, gentle, caring and strong. I'll leave the back door unlocked. Our life begins when cotton's dead. Forever yours, Holly. Fuck ! Oh, fuck ! Oh, this is the last straw, Dewey. Oh, Jesus ! What happened ? Two of the dumbest words in the English language: Dewey wise ! Fucker slashed my tires. Slashed my fuckin' tires ! I'm walking over here, trying to call triple "a," maybe catch a ride home with you. Tried to run me over. He told me this morning he was going to get you. I know I screwed his wife, but don't you think he's taking it a little too far ? You need to attend to that. No, I gotta attend to Dewey first. I'm gonna call the cops. Did you see him slash your tires ? No, but I know it was him. Did you get a glimpse of him when he ran you over ? No, but I know he did it. Was it his car, that ugly brown Taurus he drives ? Binny, I don't know. I was concentrating on saving my own skin. It had to have been him. Who else could it be ? It might not be a great idea to go... To the police about Dewey when you have Olivia running around dreaming up god knows what. He tried to kill me twice this week. Twice. Let me talk to him. You ? I understand his type. Trust me. Don't get into any trouble on my account, okay, binny ? Let's get you home and put something on this face. No, no. Promise me you won't mess with Dewey wise. I promise... To take care of you. What brings you here, and how'd you get in ? You remember my friend Judy ? I take care of her plants when she's out of town. I heard you moved in, and I thought I could kill two birds with one stone. Water the rubber plants and warm up your new place. Hutch send you ? Fuck hutch. I hope you break the bank with him. When did you become a hutch hater ? You two breathe the same air. Since he tried to rape me in the office today. Can I come in ? Come on in, sister. Tell me all about it. I think I might have broken his nose... When I hit him with the pencil sharpener. There was blood everywhere. Of course, I quit on the spot. Good for you. Yeah. I just can't believe he attacked you. You can't believe it ? I've known the man for 18 years. He's never shown the slightest interest in me. You of all people. Yeah, I know. I'm not exactly a calendar girl. I didn't mean it like that. It's just that he's always held you in such high regard. Yeah, well, I found out the dark side of hutch rimes, let me tell ya. Like you did. So, why did he throw you over ? Did he find a new babe ? He didn't throw me over. Let me set the record straight. I ended it with him, and he couldn't deal with it. Oh, yeah. Hutch rimes picked the wrong kettle of fish to mess with in Olivia wise. Give 'im hell, sister. Hmm. Did you call the police ? No. I wanted to talk to you first. I'm afraid it might end up being a he-said-she-said thing. Where I'd really like to get that dick is in his pocketbook. Maybe we can team up on this harassment thing together. Now, the lawyer I talked to today said that I would have a much stronger case... If I was able to line up other women that hutch had screwed over. You talked to a lawyer ? Yeah. When I told him what hutch did to me, he was salivating at the prospects. What exactly did hutch do to you to make you go to such lengths ? He thought he could dump me and fire me. He used me. Olivia wise does not take shit lying down. I thought you said he didn't dump you. Ah ! Who's keeping score ? It's all water under the bridge now. Hutch is goin' down, and I am gonna be there to watch. What's all that about, you wanting hutch to kill Dewey ? Did hutch tell you that ? That man doesn't have the guts to kill anyone, especially when it comes to love. Love. He has no idea what love is, but he is gonna find out what hate is. Believe you me. I bet you can see 30 miles from up here. See that light out there ? It's the top of mount Evans. I see it. You can't put a price on this view. There's a lot of things you can't put a price on. True love, for instance. Hutch ? Hutch ! Hutch, wake up ! It's me ! Binny ! Open up ! Oh. Shut the door. What are you doing here ? It's after 2:00. And do you know where your employees are ? Come in here and sit down. So ? What's goin' on ? What's goin' on ? Well, I set fire to Dewey's house. I made sure he wasn't home. I hit Olivia on the head with a scotch bottle... And threw her off the balcony of her pretty new apartment. I feel sure she's dead. Pretty productive night, wouldn't you say ? Um, you did what ? I eliminated your problems ! Tell me you didn't... don't worry. - I made it so the police won't suspect you. - Me ? I got it all figured. Obviously you'll be a prime suspect. - Why ? - You were fucking her. She and her lawyer were going to get together all the women... Who used to work for you that you'd had sex with. No. Guinness does it. The cops could too. It doesn't matter. She's dead ! There will be no suit. Although I feel certain the authorities will uncover the trysts... You and Olivia partook in at the sleep easy motel. It's not going to be that hard. You were lunchtime regulars. Yeah, but, uh, I didn't kill her. You did. Yeah, and I'd do it again. And as far as killing people, I know what happened ten years ago when you and Holly... Cooked up that harebrained scheme to kill cotton. Not that I blame you two. Cotton proudfit was a butthole and a prick who deserved to die for what he did to Holly. How did you know ? I make it my business to know things about the man I love. I also know how you got the water and mineral rights from cotton's ranch. He had to sell them off at a pittance to pay for a good lawyer when he killed Holly. That was good business on your part, if a bit deep in irony. I wonder if cotton ever found out. Well, we'll deal with that if we have to. I want you to know that that was the biggest mistake of my life. I have regretted that night. None of that concerns US now. We gotta work on your alibi for tonight. Why do I need an alibi ? I didn't do anything. What's your alibi ? Why would I have any reason to kill Olivia ? Let me tell you how we're gonna beat this. There was a method to my madness tonight. Hear me out. Dewey and Olivia were having problems. You and I and any number of people will attest to that. Dewey will be the prime suspect in her death. Before I set the fire, which will be blamed on Olivia, I broke into Dewey's house and stole a pair of his shoes. There's a size ten footprint in spilled scotch on Olivia's balcony. Just to clinch it... I walked in his shoes on the carpet on the way out of the apartment. Oh, you think of everything. To coin your phrase, that's what I get the big bucks for. So, you did all this... Dewey and Olivia... the whole time I'm home watching TV ? I had a plan, and I executed it. Cops won't get to you for a while. They'll have their hands full with Dewey. We'll touch base in the morning and finalize your alibi. Get a good night's rest, darling. I... you know how I feel. Oh, god. What, did you leave someone out, binny ? Jesus Christ. You'll meet him soon enough. No. No, no. No, please, please. What ? Stop it ! This is gonna be your final restin' place. You make your peace with god. I don't understand. Why are you doing this to me ? Shut up, asshole. You made me an orphan for ten years. No ! Whoa. Back off, son. We want him conscious for his final rites. Look, if it's about the water... shut up, snake shit. You're not gettin' any water. Oh, god. Holly just worked for me. Anything that's in this letter is her imagination. You can't kill... You can't kill me. You can't kill me. Be a man for once in your sorry life. Don't beg. Get the rifle, son. Sayin' your prayers, rimes ? Dad, I wanna do it. You haven't called me dad since... since before... I missed you... I missed you so much, dad. Oh ! Dad. Dad, he's gettin' away. No, no, that's enough. That's enough. That's not how I planned it, but I'll get the bastard. He's goc no place to hide. Listen. You follow there. I'll circle around. He'll run out of cover soon. Give me the rifle.

What made you plan to kill me ? Why ? What were you after ? Talk to me, you son of a bitch ! Why ? Why'd you put her up to this ? Tell US ! Talk to US, man ! I didn't put her up to anything. She planned it all herself. You're lyin' ! Holly hated you like no other. She enlisted me to help, but she didn't want me to kill you. She wanted you for herself. That's how much she hated you. She saw you turning her son into another you, and she couldn't bear it ! She wouldn't stand for that ! So she wanted to kill you to save her son ! No ! I helped her. I was there that night. I came in through the door that she left open. I was there, but you fucked up... By killing your wife. Holly loved me, and she couldn't stand the goddamn sight of you. You hit her one too many times. See ? You should have died that night, not her. She did it for you, son. She couldn't face you turning into a monster like him. So go ahead. You can blame me. You can kill me. But you killed Holly.
