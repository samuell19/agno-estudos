What do we need with a crazy planet ? That's not it. We owe it to the universe. If those are earth teenagers, they've got to cause trouble when they grow up. You picked the biggest goof-off on all Mars to be the advance man. Naturally. He's so stupid that if he's captured, he'll confuse the enemy. That's part of our plan. Here he comes. It's not that I don't like him. I can't stand him ! So if you'll excuse me, I'll leave now. Plang. Plang. Plang.plang. You look like some kind of nut. I can't help it. This is the way earth people dress. I've been studying their habits for the past three years. So be it. Know your mission ?to prepare the way for the infiltration. Good. In 48 hours then,be ready to meetthe first party of ten on earth. Plang. Ooh-yee-hoo-hoo ! Big lunk ?hmm ? Look over there. Doesn't that make you think of something ? Heck, yeah. It's time for volleyball practice ! Come on, team. Big lunk ! Mush ! What'd you go and do that for ? It is time for volleyball practice ! I'm not asking why you did it, I'm telling you you're right and he's wrong. Thanks, vikki. How do you know ? Don't you remember ? I went with him last year. Come on, gang, let's head for the beach and volleyball. And leave the girls ?no. We need vikki for setter. What about love, romance, cool lips and moonlight ? Sounds great. Never tried playing volleyball in the moonlight. Maybe we'll try it tonight. Come on. I'm comin', I'm comin'. All right ! Will ya-- I'm comin', I told ya. All right, will ya ? Yeah ? Boss, it's fleegle.Hello, fleegle ? Where are ya ?I'm gettin' waterlogged. Are you in the bath tub ?no, stupid, I'm not in the bathtub. Then where are you ?look, fleegle, listen very carefully. Right next door is more money than you and me has ever seen. Boss, i--I'm sitting here on my big raft doing nothin'. What ? Stop stuttering.But, boss-- now look, get that Indian and that Swede and get 'em up here right away. Boss, I got something to tell you.What's that ? I'm not a mechanic.Where are you ? Sycamore and valley.You knucklehead. You're at the bottom of the hill. Walk up here and try not to attract any attention. Ya hear me ? Yeah, but--right away ! That stupid idiot. Boss, that's a long walk up the hill and it's-- but, but, but--what ? All right, team, let's go. Jilda, serve the way I showed you. Come on, baby. Come on. Jilda, i-- what happened to him ? Oh, you're all looking so healthy this morning ! Now, breathe deeply. Because we have a nice warm summer coming, and I want to bring the color to your cheeks. Ooh ! Mmm. Harold, Cynthia, not yet. I shall have to talk to you about the birds and the bees, and the teenagers. I know it takes self-control, but there's a time and a place for everything. Now, listen to the leaves rustling, and the birds singing. Psst ! - Psst ! - Oh, heavens, is it possible there's a snake in the grass ? Psst ! Up here ! You're casting shadows on my roses. Terribly sorry. I should hope so. What if I were having a sunbath ? It's kinda embarrassing for me, I mean, coming from Mars and like that. But my power jet pack just pooped out... Right here. - Did you say from Mars ? - Yeah. Don't you believe me ? Do you believe I talk to flowers ? Why, certainly. Why not ? Then I believe that you come from Mars. I thought maybe if you could throw me up a rope, you could pull me down. Oh, oh, certainly. So, that nutty advance man of yours made conduct. With what ? What's an "aunt Wendy" ? An aunt Wendy is a reasonably average earth adult. If she's average, I don't see why we want the place so badly. Oh, gosh, Connie, I didn't mean to hit big lunk on the head. It happens. But his head is his weak spot. I'll say ! I guess that blows the volleyball game. Volleyball ? What are you standing around for ? Let's get practicing ! Let's go, champ ! Team, let's get cracking. Big lunk ? - Aren't you forgetting something ? - Oh, yeah. You can see better from over here, honey. All right, team, let's go. Come on, hit it. Oh ! Him ! Him ! Did I tell ya ? Did I tell ya right ? Yeah, you sure did tell us right, boss. Look at them, getting footprints all over our beach. That's right, boss. Footprints all over except where they were sittin'. We gotta chase them off the beach before they got it all footprinted up. Aah ! J.d., you and alberta take the lead. I, Eric Von zipper, your leader, will personally bring up the rear. Let's go ! Big lunk ! They got the boss ! Boy, someone's gonna get it for this ! Someone's really gonna get it. Oh, boy, he's gonna be mad. He hates fish. They're responsible.Yeah ! You wait till he comes to ! You're gonna get Eric Von zipper's revenge, boy ! I can hardly wait ! Hey, what happened ? As usual, nothing ! Here, why don't you blow ? I don't understand you. I tell you I'm a martian. I tell you there'll be ten more like me in 48 hours. What does that mean to you ? Forty-eight hours ? That's two days. Now, now, keep still, dear. Please. You don't believe I'm from Mars, right ?i believe. I'll prove it to you. This is my transducer. Oh, we don't use words like that in this house, dear. You're just the right size for big lunk's last year's clothes. A transducer is what you earth people call a ray gun. Oh, yes, I know. Big lunk used to play with them... Before he discovered the pogo stick. I'll show you what it can do. Oh ! Isn't that nice ? Have you ever thought of becoming a magician ? On the stage ? In vaudeville ? You'd look very handsome in a tuxedo. Listen, we're gonna take over ! Yes, I know. Young people eventually do. What a wonderful color with your eyes. I'll show you exactly what's going to happen. You just sit down and wait a minute. You're going to put on a magic show for me ? Yeah, I'm gonna put on a magic show for ya. This is my teleporter. It looks very convenient. Is it a kind of radio ? Now, with this, I can send anything I want directly to Mars... In one hundred-thousandthof a millisecondmerely by adjusting these dials. Can you now ? What do they need ? - They don't need anything. - Well, why send it to them ? - The sign's in there, right ? - Right. Now, I turn the teleporter on, position the function dial to "transmit," um, set the time lapse to zero. Now, watch. I have just sent the bus stop sign to Mars ! How wonderful ! Do they have buses there ? - No. - Well, why do you send it there then ? They won't do anything with the bus stop sign. Don't worry, dear. You did a very nice trick. And I'm delighted to get that old sign out of the room. Listen, I'm trying to tell you something. There's going to be an invasion of a whole army of others just like me ! Oh, isn't that nice. But I suggest you get hotel reservations. Summers at the beach can be awful. People come from all over. Your friends won't be able to get rooms. Look, just by reversing the process, I set this dial to "receive." I set the time lapse to whatever time I want... And whoever is in the receiving area on Mars, eventually it will be an army, will materialize one by one in there ! Oh, good ! We have a lot of very nice unattached girls around here. And I would be happyto introduce any of your friendsto any of my young friends. By the way, how do I introduce you ?pleasantly, I hope. I didn't mean that. What's your name ?go go. I beg your pardon ?go go. Go go ? Oh, that's ridiculous. I shall call you George. You follow me down tothe pool house and we'll get youinto a proper swimsuit...

Mush ! Hello ? So we made a slight mistake. I thought that house next door was yours. I guess they're still there. You nitwit birdbrain ! That's the house where we're working the scam, and I hope for your sake, the blonde don't run into the old lady's nephew, big lunk. If she does, it could blow the whole master plan. Ow ! Master plan. That's got something to do with what we're doing here, right, boss ? Listen and I'll give you a rundown of the whole master plan. We rented this house because of the old tomato next door, affectionately known to the teenager element of the community as "aunt Wendy." You gonna squeeze my nose again if I ask a question ?no. What is it ? Who is aunt Wendy ? And what the heck are we doing here ? Aunt Wendy happens to run the most expensive dress shop in this town. She sells only to teenagers. She loses money on every dress she sells, so how does she stay alive ? Volume ?wrong ! Keep hitting me like that and I'm gonna hear birds. Aunt Wendy's husband died 20 years ago. He was a millionaire. Only he didn't leave no dough in the bank. What does that mean to you ? I don't know, but whatever you say, I agree. I'll tell you. It means there's millions of bucks of cash hidden in that house. Every two weeks, that old ding-a-ling sends her beetle-browed nephew, who goes by the suspicious name of big lunk, to the bank with 25 grand. That's to make up the deficit of the dress shop. Now, do you get the picture ? Yeah, we bust in, find the dough and blast off, right ? Wrong ! We don't use brute force. We use brains ! Remember ? Who's the king of the con men ?you, boss. J. Sinister hulk himself. You can say that again. Now then, obviously that middle-aged fruitcake... Ain't gonna show us where she stashed the loot, right ?whatever you say, boss. Now what do we do ? We attack the weakest link, "big lunk." "Big link" ?big lunk ! Aah ! Mmmmm ! Mmmmm. Hi ! Really, i-- They like to be formally introduced. Hey, you forgot this ! Boss ! Boss ! They're coming ! See ? I told you not to worry. Gimme those opera glasses before you hurt yourself. Oh, yeah, that's my blonde, all right. Me good Indian ! Me surrender. Stop ! Stop ! You forgot your brush ! That's what you call an intelligence officer ? That's what I call a nut ! I call him a nut too, but look how nicely he fits in on earth, chasing Indians and blondes. He's so stupid, he'll probably catch the Indian. Connie, how are you, my dear ? Fine, I guess. No, I'm not. I'm just miserable. It's the big lunk of a nephew of mine, isn't it ? Yeah.he's just a great big clown, and he doesn't know a good thing when he sees it. You have nothing to worry about. You're lovely, intelligent, and a dear, sweet girl. Somehow it doesn't seem to be enough. I have it !what ? The solution. We'll make him jealous. With who ? Or is it "with whom" ? Don't look now, but he's coming down the beach. Is he nice-looking ?he's positively handsome. What should i-- this afternoon I'll be at my shop. You ask him to drive you there. I've got a new dress for you to try on that'll knock his eyes out. Guaranteed... date bait. But, but, but-- stop sputtering like a motorboat, and try to look seductive. Oh, there you are, my dear George ! George ? Oh, yes, George. My name is George. My name is George.Oh, silly boy ! Of course I know. What's that ? Where did you get it ?i went back to the house to get a shirt. There was someone in the bathroom, and she dropped this. Huh ? Oh, dear. Are you sure you were in the right house ? I'm certain. This person appeared to be washing herself. Then she hit me with a wet sponge and started running. An American Indian with a tomahawk started chasing her into the bushes. I ran after them, but they disappeared. This kid is a kook ! No, dear, not a kook. He's a martian. A martian ?yes, from Mars. - Both you birds belong in a clock ! Forgive me, George. May I introduce Connie ?how do you do ? Whoa ! Thank you. Sure, sure. How nice. I know the two of you are going to like each other. Be sure to come to my shop this afternoon. Shop this afternoon ! You wouldn't have to shop this afternoon... If you hadn't messed things up. What mess up ?what kind of Indian are you ? First you get lost on the freeway, then you go to the wrong house, and you let her take a bath. No can stop her once she make-um up mind to take bath. Oh, ja, ja, ja. Ja, ja, ja. Will you turn her off ? Ja, ja, ja-- how can a man run an organization... When he's surrounded by stupid incompetents ? - I don't know, boss. How ? - You shut up. And you take her into town to that dress shop I told you about... That that aunt Wendy flip runs. The kids dig her stuff. And whatever she spends, I'll take out of your salary. Cowabonga ! You bet your fat feathers, cowabonga ! And you, will you sit down someplace and try to keep outta trouble ? Sure, boss. You don't have another chair like this ?no, stupid, one's enough. What happens if you turn this ? Aah ! Boss, speak to me. No can speak. Kiskas squashed.The whole thing was an accident. Being an intelligence officer, I shouldn't have told aunt Wendy, but I am from Mars. And I'm from Venus. Here, do my back.It looks done. Venus, that's strange. Most of the girls I met from Venus were green and had gills. Lovely creatures. I don't understand you earth people... After all the studying I've done of earth habits. Mmm. Earth habits ? Customs, idioms. Twenty-three skidoo !we don't say that anymore. Cowabonga ?some of us say that. George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Mickey mantle, Frankie avalon--you certainly have a well-rounded education. And you have a well-rounded--what ? All right. You gotta cause disasters, huh ? Now, no more disasters. Sure ! Sure ! Mumble, mumble. Right, cutie ? Ja, ja. Cowabonga. Car ready. Listen, featherbrain, I want you to take this yellow-top canary... Into that dress shop in town that I told you about. Now, no accidents, and I don't want you to get lost this time, understand ? Chief rotten eagle never get lost. Sometimes he not know where he is, but never lost. Ja, ja, ja. Ja, ja, ja. Now, get goin'. And when you're in town keep your eyes peeled for that big lunk kid. If you see him, sic Helga on him, got-um ? Got-um. How chief rotten eagle know big lunk when he see him ? That's easy. He's always wearin' this goofy broad-billed red baseball cap. Got-um. Goofy broad... Red baseball cap. Forget it ! It's gonna do ya no good. You're gonna stay tied up like that for quite a while. You know something ? You're accident prone. Big lunk, are you sure you don't mind loaning me your car ? Of course not. Anything you want. You know I'm waiting for another boy. Good ! Good ! Then you won't be lonesome. What if he makes a pass at me while we're driving ? Makes a pass ? At you ? Ha. Oh, if you don't think--i trust you, honey. You're a buddy. Well, that does it ! Hey ! Isn't that my sport coat ? My slacks ! And my shoes ! You're absolutely right. Your aunt said you wouldn't mind. Oh, my clothes, my car, my girl. Is there anything else you'd like ? Well, now that you mention it, I've never seen a hat like that before. Harry, you like this sidecar ? Jerome, when we attach it, you're my chauffeur. You sure gotta hand it to that Eric Von zipper. Yeah, if you don't, he'll take it from you anyway. Man ! Is this great ? Is this great ? J.d., listen, how am I gonna recognize that kid that's the leader of them volleyball kids ? Oh, he always wears that dopey broad-billed red baseball hat. Yeah ? Him I want first. The kid with the dopey broad-- Billed--i can say it. The kid with the dopey-- with the red baseball cap. Right ? right ! You're staring at me.I know. That's rude.I'm sorry. When you met me, did you feel something... Funny in here ? Boys aren't supposed to ask questions like that. Oh. I'm not sure of the rules yet. I felt something funny... Like, like I went all soft inside. Are you for real ?what do you mean ? It's the things you say. It's almost as though you're from another world. Did aunt Wendy tell you ?tell me what ? That I'm from Mars. I am, you know.I can believe it. Can you ? I don't know why, but it's very important to me that you do. Tell me, do people... Get married there ? Certainly. We get numbers. And when the central committee feels we're ripe, we have a lottery... And each boy gets the girl whose number he holds. Oh, that sounds real romantic ! That's what happened inside me. What ? I said to myself, "when the numbers are passed out, I hope I win her." Oh, brother ! Are you angry at me ? I don't think so. You're a flip, but a sweet one, I think. ♪There has to be a reason ♪ ♪for every little thing ♪there has to be a summer ♪ ♪to follow every spring ♪there has to be a reason ♪ ♪for every night and day ♪there has to be a reason ♪ ♪just why I feel this way ♪ ♪as a matter of fact ♪it's easy to see ♪it's really nothing new ♪ ♪it's a natural act plain as can be ♪ ♪it's why there's me and you ♪ ♪there has to be a reason ♪♪there has to be a reason ♪as sure as night and day ♪♪as sure as night and day ♪I know you're the reason ♪and I know you're the reason ♪ ♪why I feel this way ♪as a matter of fact ♪it's easy to see ♪it's really nothing new ♪ ♪it's a natural act plain as can be ♪ ♪it's why there's me and you ♪ ♪there has to be a reason ♪♪there has to be a reason ♪as sure as night and day ♪♪as sure as night and day ♪I know you're the reason ♪and I know you're the reason ♪ ♪why I feel this way ♪and I know you're the reason ♪♪I know you're the reason ♪why I feel this way - Hey, chief ? - Hey, chief ?
