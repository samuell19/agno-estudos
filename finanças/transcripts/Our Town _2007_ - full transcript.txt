Search for a suspect of women serial killer They could have done a better job. Mister! What is it, Hyoi? Doesn't this look like me? It does look very much like you. Give me your phone. I'll call the police. You are a funny guy, you know that? No one gets it. Even if I spell it out to them. 8 years old, dancing outfit A lady in her 40s Long hair, a piercing Kim So-yeon # I may choke up... # and tears may flow... # when love passes... Make sure you don't make a sound. Don't come out, okay? Go to sleep! Who is he? Don't mind him. He's my nephew. The lady you asked about. I looked into her file. It turns out she was a private moneylender. The investigation initially focused on connections to grudges related to money, and then there were rumors about her being promiscuous so the focus was shifted to connections to a love affair... But that didn't result in any progress, and the case was closed. I mean, the relationships a tough moneylender has are pretty obvious. What about her family? There was a young son. He was 11 at the time. What happened to him? He was probably taken care of by a legal guardian and should have become independent by now. I made a list of the debtors. You can look at it later. The lady owned other businesses too. She'd taken them from those who couldn't pay her back. She even had quite a few buildings. There's a printing house, a furniture factory and a barbeque restaurant... A furniture factory? Yes. It's called Gyeong-jin Furniture. Gyeong-jin Furniture? Gyeong-jin Furniture? What's the address? It's in Sacho-2-dong - Help yourself. - Thank you! You are so handsome! He's really smart and really good at fighting, too. He looks smart, but I don't think he looks like he would fight. You wouldn't know. You're a woman. I don't fight. Of course you don't. You should be good friends with Gyeong-joo. Yes, ma'am! And be strong. Yes. It's called Gyeong-jin Furniture. Shit! That bitch, telling me to turn over the factory for ten grand? Is that you? Shit! What a cruel bitch. - Who the hell is this? - Go inside and get some rest. - I asked who this is. - Just go inside and get some rest! I'm the head of the household, answer me. He's my friend! The one that has no parents, right? You little piece of shit! I told you not to be friends with kids like that. No wonder the house prices keep falling. It's because of that orphanage. What an asshole Look at his fucking manners! You brat! - That son of a bitch! - Just go inside! Jae-shin! I'm sorry. Don't worry about it... See you tomorrow. Fuck! Sir, let's go. Bitch! Just take everything! I'll burn everything and kill myself. What is this? Why are the lights on? Who the fuck is that? What are you doing here? You little piece of shit! I'll kill you! They say the husband got drunk and set fire. But they both burned to death. Only the child survived... I heard that the factory and the house were all taken by a moneylender. Oh no... The wife tried to save the factory. Poor little thing! Sir! What's wrong with you? You are so lucky! Why does she make you drink ginseng tea? You look pretty healthy to me. I wouldn't know, but I heard newlyweds need a lot of energy. It's not funny. Stop it. You'll never know until you get married. Turn the light off. Are you trying to blow our cover? But I'm bored. What am I to do all night? Do you believe that the criminal always comes back to the scene? This is what conventional-styled investigation is. Serial killer is different to normal criminal. They tend to draw the moment's fantasy again on the actual place. It's to feel it again. They get a lot of pleasure from it. This is very different from normal criminal coming back to the place - because they're worried. - That's what the chief said. - Did you hear it? - We were there together. Turn the light off. Those bastards know that we're detectives. Fine, so turn the light off. I'm going to the toilet so turn the light off! Let me just get some sleep. What the hell? What? They say the husband got drunk and lit the place on fire! But both parents burned to death and only the child survived... I heard that the factory and the house were all taken by a moneylender. Bring my mother back! Bring her back! If you hadn't asked for your money my mother would still be alive! Bring my mother back! Bring her back! Are you Kim Gyeong-joo? I'm detective Lee. I know you must be distressed... Hey, detective Song. I came to give you this. This was found inside the boiler room. Doesn't it belong to your father? Hey. Don't you have something to tell me? Don't you? Hey! Do you remember this place? We used to sneak out here to smoke. You even gave me a Zippo lighter for my birthday, right? Don't you have something to tell me? I... I have a confession to make. Jae-shin, Don't. I have a confession to make! You fucking asshole! Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why the fuck are you laughing? You fucking asshole! Come here, come here! You fucking asshole! Lieutenant! What happened? I came to work my shift... Did you hear about the town meeting? Yes. All the young people have to attend. Yes, of course! You must come! You killed her, right? B612 It's the message I got previously. It must be someone who knows me. The first victim was a child who was easy to control. A student at the local elementary school She probably reminded him of young Kim So-yeon. She was wearing a tutu... This time he went for a older woman who would be stronger than a young woman. She had a spot above her lips... Maybe he saw So-yeon's future in this woman. But he didn't kill Kim So-yeon right away, and had one last rehearsal. He found a girl of similar figure and age and even similar piercings and style. Who is it? In the end... his final target was Kim So-yeon. The other murders were just practice material. Jae-shin! I'm going to surrender myself. Can you take me in? I can't look after you if you're in prison. I'm sure it was the same guy. No, it has to be the same killer! Don't say anything until I obtain information about the suspect. Don't do anything. Don't ruin the case. We looked after him for over seven years. We did feel a little sorry for him but we don't have any children of our own. So we tried our best to treat him as our own, but he wouldn't open up to us. He must have gone through quite a shock. I think he made us feel Ionelier than ever. He never said much, and avoided us. Do you know where he moved to? Is it Sacho-dong? As soon as he turned 18, he asked for his mother's money. And then he just left. We've already sent out written messages to all families several times. It instructs everyone to go home before 7:00 p.m., to stay close to parents and to travel in groups of three or more. Can I ask the ladies not to sing when they're walking alone at night? I think that's scarier than anything. Rumor has it that the killer is moving in the shape of a star which means that the next location will be the road across from the park. Shouldn't there be some sort of warning? Where did you hear that crap? My son read it on the internet... Please don't spread groundless rumors. Anyway, we can't rely on the police. You saw what happened to them. Families with male adults will be included in one of the groups, no excuses. Some people have to work at night. Then get up an hour earlier and take part. You should realize that it could happen to you. Be more cooperative. He's right. The apartments will soon be completed, and if this isn't stopped, the prices will fall a great deal. It's already quite serious. This is a table for patrol groups. Everybody should take part. There will be a fine for those who don't! Please hand this over. I don't think the killer will be able - to run wild in the apartment complex. - Stop talking about the damn apartments! I didn't even get my share! That's why we should protect ourselves. Who else will help us? - That's it for today. - This is such a shitty town. Take one. Make sure you don't lose it. Good work. I don't feel like doing anything. Why don't we hit the karaoke? # Even if you know me # I can't remember you. # It gives me a lump in the throat # and tears will flow # when love passes by Little Prince stationary shop You killed her, right? B612 Little Prince Sir! Here are Kim So-yeon's school records. Leave out those from high school or university. Is there anyone from her elementary school? Elementary school? There's one called Chung Myeong-bo. He runs a veterinary hospital I told you before! Would you like me to give him a visit? It's okay. You've done enough. You can go now. Yes, sir! Transferred in grade 4 Certificate of business registration Little Prince! Why are you giving me a Valentine's day present? I just wanted you to have this. Why didn't you answer your phone? I called you all day! Do I have to answer all your calls just because you bought me the phone? That's not what I meant. I just called you because of the present. Can I have a cup of coffee? It's so cold! Hey! Come in! - Join us! It's cold, isn't it? - What's wrong with you! Hey, why can't you be nice? Give him your coat or something! Stop it! Hold on! Join us! Come on! Do they still have class reunions these days? I don't know. I haven't attended one in a long time. Did you go out with So-yeon? So-yeon! Kim So-yeon? We didn't go out. I just slept with her a few times. But she made such loud noises. I wonder if she's still like that. I guess you haven't heard the news. What news? You really don't know? Do you still talk to her? She lives with me now. Oh, really? Congratulations! You have good taste in women! She doesn't make noises anymore. How much is it? Don't worry about it. I was going to leave quietly... Bring your dog over for vaccination. And... I wasn't serious with So-yeon Sorry about what I said I didn't know! You make a loud noise. Teacher! Take your friend. B612 Teacher! Why did you take so long? I've waited for so long! Where is Jae-shin? You freak! Hey! What's the rush? Don't come any closer I don't know what I might do. Do you know why I came back to this town? Don't you know? It was all for you. I killed them for you. How come you don't recognize me? Where is Jae-shin?! Jae-shin! Jae-shin! Wait a minute. Fuck! Jae-shin! Fuck!! Hang in there! Hang in there! Jae-shin! I'm so scared! Teacher! I'm not a teacher. I'm just a substitute. So you wet your pants, no big deal! I'll clean you up before anybody sees you. Let's go. Gyeong-joo! It's starting! I'm coming! Straighten your clothes. Let's go. Sometimes I'm grateful and sometimes I hate you. I kept killing people. But strangely, I didn't feel sorry for them. Am I a monster, teacher? How did you feel, teacher? Tell me! I know you killed another one recently! How did it feel to kill again? It was fun, wasn't it? I bet you wanted to kill your friend, too! Tell me! Did you want to kill him? Aren't you grateful that I killed him for you? But you don't have to thank me. You killed my mum for me, long time ago. Come on, shoot me now! That's it! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot me now! Shoot! Why aren't you shooting? Come on! Come on! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot me now! You fucking freak! Hey! Is this fun for you? Pull them down! Hurry up! Take them off! Take them off now! Hurry! Take them off! Hey! What the fuck! Get out of here! Go away! Gyeong-joo, what are you doing? Let's go to my place and get something to eat! - I'm hungry! What do you want? - Tteokbeokki!
