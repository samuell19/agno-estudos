Hi, ladies. - Hey. - Hey, Attraction. Oh my gosh you guys, we are gonna make so much money. We got some customers, we're gonna work for floors. Stripper Gods. Yes, stripper Gods. - Help us tonight. - Yes. Okay so, new girl, hi. Hi. I'm Attraction. Uh, I'm Butterfly. Hi, Butterfly. All right, just be sexy. Look, I was telling her, this is a, you know, a safe space. You don't have to be something that you're not wanting to be, you know, or portray. This is a gentleman's club. You be you. I don't know, Gina. I knew this place was gonna be too much to handle. I'm out of here. Uh, uh, uh, uh. Look girl, let me tell you, this club is exactly what you make it, okay? You can literally make this place exactly what you want it. You don't have to worry about the customers. The customers are just as nervous as you are. Get this for me, please, babe. You don't have to worry about any of that. Come here, make your money, do what you need to do, and that's just the bottom line. Listen to her, she's an OG. She knows what she's talking about. After I make my rent money, I'm out of here. Listen, if you're nervous, it's gonna show all on you, so just make sure that you have the most uppity attitude. Just be you, you got it. Simple. What's up? Why don't you take the family on a vacation? Nah, I can't take your money, man. I can't take your money. We're not gonna be problems tonight, are we? You already know me, T. I'm just out here looking out for the girls. Shit. This shea butter is literally the best. Thank you, thank you. Long hours, long nights, formula right. All right. Remember, you wanna tease them a little bit. Leave something to the imagination. Now the second song, you gonna need to bring it, okay? Don't go to VIP. There's this gorilla pimp named Dino. Don't take no money from him. He sits up in the back with a brim hat. You can't miss him. Let's hear it for the lovely Butterfly. - Yes, - Don't worry, you got this. You got it. You got it, girl. Listen, you are, you got this. Don't be nervous. Yes. Go out there, shake your money maker. She'll be all right. But you know I've been making all this money for you. I, you know I'm trying to get this house. Now listen, you my bottom babe, okay? You doing what you supposed to do. But hey, we gotta recruit some more, though. I need you to recruit some more. Dino, you don't hear me talking to you? There's she's at. She's beautiful, beautiful. Ah, you must be the safety code inspection guy. Surprised to see you here this late. Actually, my name's Clay. Are you the owner? Uh, no I'm not, but I can take a message. Uh, can I get you a drink? No thank you, I don't mix business with fun. Actually, I was doing some upgrades in a similar club in this area and I was wondering if y'all wanted a free inspection, since that other club has a whole lot of violations. Yeah, so what do you think? Everything look cool? Well, I noticed y'all don't have handicap access in the main entrance. Yeah, I get it. Horny handicaps need access too. Absolutely. Hey, who's that babe on stage? Ah, that's Butterfly, new phenomenon. What's she doing in a place like this? Well, if y'all want that free inspection, go ahead and gimme a holler. I'll leave my business card with your boss. He can reach me at any time. Sounds good man, enjoy your night. Yes, sir. Do you have change? You got got change? Rhee, you only danced to one song. Where are you going? Look Gina, I made my money, okay? This, this isn't for me. I'm out of here. Oh, hold up, I hope you didn't take no money. That money didn't come from Dino, did it? You need to give it back. Rhee, Rhee! That ain't ain't the God. Man, that ain't the God. In the flesh. Man, yo, bro, what it do, man? What's poppin', man. Man, I appreciate you coming to the spot, man. You see we got a lit up in here, man. Got plenty of girls. Anything that you need, what you want, we got you, baby. Everything good, boss? All right look, Travis, I just received a call from the owner. He's watching the cameras right now as we speak. He noticed the money never made its way to the register for that VIP room. Do you have it? Oh yeah, shit. Is this it, huh? It was 500. - 5, 500? - Mm-hmm, fine. And Travis being a manager is not just a pretty name tag, it's an obligation, it's a commitment to do what's right for the owner. And also being a manager is being proactive, not reactive. - What's up, baby? - Oh, what it do, my dog. Man. Man, welcome to the The Spot, brother. Appreciate, I appreciate the invite. Man, ain't no biggie, baby. Telling you, man, I love all the- - You a guest in The Spot, man. I see you got the fellas with you, man. You know everywhere I go they go. Well, hey listen here, man. You got the pick of the litter. So you can chose any female ass fit. Man, come on. Yo, that keep me all up. Hey, man, do what it do, brother. Hey, relax, have a good night, baby. - Appreciate it. - Hey, holla at me if you need me. - Man, good seeing you, bro. - Have a great night then. Whoa. Nick, Nick. What the hell are you doing? Was your ceiling leaking as bad as mine? You can stay but only for a couple days, this place is fucking treacherous. Thank you. You know it sure ain't the same without y'all. I see you decided to wear it. Makes you look perfect, like butterfly. You know I'm not one much for jewelry, but I did promise you I'd wear it. The only thing that I need you to promise me is that you can do everything you can to get our son back. I promise. Nick. Nick, wake up. Nick. Nick. Nick, wake up! Nick, wake up! Wake up! Nick! No, no, no, no. Nick, please, wake up. Please wake up. Please wake up. You should call the mortician. I know a dead body when I see one. So why did you leave? Because it wasn't a good place for Milo to come home. Because it was not. You just lost all but any chance of getting your son back, having no permanent residence. After nine years in foster care, a drug addicted mother, a drug dealing father, now you choose to live on the streets where everything is for sale and everyone is for sale. You have to choose a better life for yourself. Homelessness is the result of making poor decisions, Rhee. All because an attractive girl like yourself chose to be with a drug addict. The cycle needs to stop. So are you using? All I wanted was my family. They're my freedom. Nick is the only one who ever loved me. He's the only one who believed in me. He wouldn't let me use no drugs. All I want now is my son and to be free. That is all I want now, my freedom. That's all I want is to be free. Why I allow myself to grow so attach to these cases? We all have wishes, Rhee. But wishes should never compromise safety. I would love to find a shelter for you, but they're awful. You have a hearing coming up and your court appointed attorney is not going to be pleased. I will do anything to get my son back. He is my responsibility. He's all mine and nobody else's and I'll make sure he wants for nothing. Hey, I'm sorry for your loss. I see you just got down here off the nickel. If you ain't lost your mind by now you sure as hell will after a while. Did the pervert try to come on you while you was asleep? Word is he's a dentist. He gets off by harassing homeless women. So what's it take? You know, to live out here? You want to know what it takes to cope. Let me tell you. And from now on, that's your bathroom and your shower. Excuse me, miss. I see you've been recently displaced too. Can I introduce myself? My name is Eugene. I'm kind of the coordinator around here of all the, the homeless camps in the area. You know, you need to know something. The housing authority, they're, they're corrupt. They, they took a hundred million dollars from the federal government and they didn't spend penny of it on housing. I don't belong here either. I, I used to be an investment banker. Home and a family and my wife, she cheated on me. Look, I'm gonna run for city council. I really believe I can make a change. Can I count on your support? Look, I, I I have this, I have this here, this petition. And if you sign the petition, that means you can vote in the next election against the camping ban. Just sign right here and that way together we can, we can make a difference. I think we can solve homelessness. Can I count on your support? Get a real job, lazy bitch! You assholes! Ma'am. Ma'am. Have you accepted Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior? You need to repent. You need to repent. You want a hit? What? You're living in a tent. Where? Downtown off the bar, it's not so bad. That's no place to live. I wish I could put you up in my place but Travis is so stubborn. Rhee, this is Slim. Slim this Rhee. Do you have any experience with bartending? - No. - Ah. But she can learn. She's a quick learner. I don't know, Gina. Maybe she can bust tables. A hundred dollars a week. You do well there, I'll let you work behind the bar. That's great, she'll take it. Can she speak for herself? She does have vocal chords, right? Yeah, I'll take it. Hey, Slim, quick suggestion. Come on, time is money. I was thinking maybe you can serve breakfast all day instead of the morning to amp off the menu. I didn't spend 23 years shucking oysters in North Carolina so a girl like you could tell me how to run my business. Now I don't see you paying none of the bills around here, do I? Look it was just a suggestion. You say business need to be amped up so I was just offering some friendly advice. Ugh. Good news. Okay, okay, okay. So I'm going to ask him what day you can officially start and what time, what shift. - Okay. - And I'm gonna give you a call. Okay, thank you so much girl. You don't need to thank me. Do I know you from somewhere? No, not yet anyway. Okay, I gotta go. Hey, don't you work at The Spot? Now I know you. You were great out there, girl. I was gonna try to ask you out but you left. Look, that's not me, okay? Girl, let see what the hell Dino got going on out here. Don't forget the, and watch yourself there. And don't, and don't touch the top. I need my hair and my nails done. He out here tripping. - This your girl? - I don't know what the hell he got going on. Oh, yeah. I'm about to find out though. - It's your girl. - From The Spot the other night. Wait right there. Yeah she owe me loot yo. I got big plans for her in Vegas. Yeah, I don't give a fuck what you do to get her. Make it happen. - Dino. - What's up? You forget I'm your bottom bitch? What you need? I need my hair done, my nails done. You're suppose to be investing in me. I got you, I got you, boo. Thank you. Now go take care of the girls and get them ready tonight. - All right. - Okay. - I got you, baby. - Okay. Yeah, back to what you said. We gotta catch up with our girls. Girl, I got that money though. Look, you work for me. All this selling hair and lingerie will not be going down in my place. Every time I turn around you got some kind of hustle going on, Gina. First it's hair then it's makeup. You need to save that hustling for that titty bar. Look Slim, I can't help it. I'm an entrepreneur just like you. - Huh? - This is my true calling. You could have fooled me. Seems like shaking your ass on that pole is your true calling. Now if that was the case, you wouldn't be here working for me would you? Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? You're supposed to be training. Look, meet me in the diner. I'll get you all trained up, okay? Hey, you okay, Gina? You look so down. No, it's Slim, it's Travis, the club. It's everything. You ever feel like life is passing you by and you're just missing out. I put my all into everything that I do. Even my dancing. You know, sometimes I wonder if people see the art in my dancing or if they just see another piece of dancing on the stage. You know how bad I wanna leave that club? And they all try to bring me down. I just wanna be a success in life. Whatever that is, I just want success. I'm right there with you girl. But don't dwell on the circumstances. Ask yourself this, okay, what is more important to you, success or money? Focus on success, Gina. You'll always be a success. Look Travis, we need to talk. Talk about what? About everything. You need to stop booking VIP to Dino. He just uses it for the girls to work with him outside. I can barely get up in there. He knows I'm gonna call him out on all his shit. Look, I don't know why you keep stressing me out over VIP. You making plenty of money dancing on the stage and on the floor. Let those girls at VIP do them and you do you. Why you have to get caught up with one of Dino's girls? Look, I thought we were past that. We were. But apparently you aren't 'cause you let him hold it over your head. You know what? He better not try anything with Rhee, especially after that money grab she pulled. Wait, wait, money grab? Don't tell me she took money from him. Oh, snap. She better pay him back ASAP. He's a heavy handed dude. Making a deal with him is like making a deal with the devil. And he's got receipts for that ass. That's how he gets all this new girls. I thought you put her on game. I did. But last time I did it was like too late. Maybe I can lend her the money. See, this is why I can't stop dancing just yet. You got 40 racks saved away. Okay. You got plenty of money to take a break from dancing. Just be patient. You know what? I'll phase him out. No, you and I both are not done with this club just yet. I have to finance my boutique and my salon and you got all your other bills. Look, you're all over the place, Gina. You need to zero in and focus on one thing. You got your hands in so many different ventures. It's 20 minutes over here, 20 minutes over there. You need to know the difference between a business and a hustle. A business is a solid asset, baby girl, that's what you need. Let's face it, your best asset has always been this big ass of yours. I don't need you a sarcasm, okay? You know what, things take time adjusting. And my greatest asset is not something you can see or feel on. It's actually my drive and my ambition so that you ever get it twisted. You think I really like shaking my at that club? 'Cause I don't. But it's the only IPO that I can bank on to finance my goals since I can't depend on you. Look, I'm not as much of a go-getter as you. Apparently. You know what? Why don't you make Slim an offer and buy him out? You're always talking about how he is not running the business the right way. If you were to implement some of your ideas, like things can improve. Slim's always complaining about how business is slow and he just hates it in general like. Make him offer, do it. I don't want to run a bar and grill. I want my boutique and salon. Besides Slim is a hater and a male chauvinist, he would never ever sell to a woman and employee. Baby girl, don't be so sure. Don't be so sure. Money talks, okay? Stranger things have happened. Look, you already know the industry inside and out. You can hit the ground running. Look, no matter what you decide to do, I'm here for you. I love you and I believe in you, so go for it. Oh, thank you, boo bear. Oh my God, what the hell? Are you stalking me or something? Look, all I know you can be stalking me, all right? I'm sorry about the other night. I didn't mean to offend you. I just come out a little aggressive sometimes. Where are you going? I give you a ride. Promise not to stalk me anymore? Yeah, I promise. All right, you can take me to work. Okay. My name's Clay. What's yours? Rhee. So where you from, Rhee? Port Arthur. What brings you to Austin? You ask too many questions? Sorry, I'm just, I'm not really the mood for conversation right now. Just take me to work please. We're not together anymore. So y'all broke up. Okay, okay. So where are we going exactly? Same place I saw you last. All right. Well what are you doing after you get off work? I would love to take you out to get some food. I get off at six. Okay, good, I see you at six. How was everything? That was one hell of a good breakfast taco. Thank you so much for bearing with me. It was my first day. Oh, hell, your honesty it went fantastic. It's a, it is a rare quality you can't find nowadays. Hey, you know you'll have to come down to Houston sometime, I've got a restaurant down there. We sell the best seafood in town. Oh wow. So you are in the restaurant business? Number 36 for pickup. No, I'm an oil man. Restaurant's owned by my son and I have a hotel that is managed by my, my daughter. My daughter can't stand it. She hates it. She wants to be a stay at home wife. Hell, she's married to a big rancher and he doesn't want her to lift a finger. Presents a problem for me 'cause I can't find anybody that I can trust to replace her. I know you think, oh, you know, it's just, you're a problem, old man. I sense you've got a nice personality. Don't waste it on lowly folk. You, you ought to go places with that personality. Thank you. Oh by the way, my name is Tex. It's, it's a pleasure to meet you. And uh- Rhee, come and get this order! What are you waiting on? I'm Rhee. Oh well that's fine. Well in event, have a wonderful day. It was nice seeing you. You as well. I'll take this. Thank you, sir. How's everything going? You dropped your wallet. Oh, my God. Not everyone would've done that. Well you've got some qualities, young lady. You've got character. Character as I used to tell my children wasn't made isn't, it's made from scratch. It's just like butter, a slow churn. Well, thank you very much. This is for your trouble. Oh my gosh. Thank you. Have a wonderful day. You too, sir. Oh, damn, you must be really hungry. Looks like you haven't eaten nothing all day. My man is dead and my kid's in foster care. Oh, damn. Did you like poison him in his drink like those ladies do to collect life insurance? Hell, no! He OD'ed. Oh snap. How how'd you lose your kid? Our slum Lord called CPS on us after he thought we called the state inspector on him. Wasn't paying your rent? I always paid my rent. He was running in illegal housing company. They inspected and saw that my man was using and they knew it wasn't a good place for me to raise my son. My man moved out but, but it was too late. They wouldn't let me have my kid back. Well, sorry to hear that. Why would you be with a man who's on drugs anyways? I mean he stopped using when we met. He had gotten clean, but when he lost his job in Port Arthur, he relapsed. But he was doing so well, you know, and I was working and anyway, what, uh, where are you from? I'm from Abilene, small town. School wasn't working out, you know, so I moved here to help my daddy while he's sick. I'm sorry to hear that. How sick is he? Well, he ain't got much longer. He's in hospice care right now. So I gotta manage his business and take care of him with an in-home nurse. Well, uh, what'd you go to school for? I played football, QB at a DT school. I got hurt. Hey, you know what? Let's get out of here. I know a really cool spot where you can see the city by the lake. Um, yeah, okay. But I can't stay out too late. I have got an appointment in the morning. So why the name Butterfly? Why not? It's a pet name my ex used to call me. Yeah, but what does name Butterfly mean to you? Well it means something a lot different to me than it does in the dictionary, that's for sure. Well, can't love the butterfly and disrespect the caterpillar. What's wrong? Why do you look so sad? What can I do and make you happy? When were you the happiest? When I have my son. I was free. Free? Free from what? Just free. So are you gonna get your kid back? Of course he's my shadow. Well, we'll stop me from getting him? I mean, your old man is gone. A home, backyard where he can run around and play and not have to grow up as fast as I did. So where you living now? There you go again, being all nosy. Right, hey, I'm just trying to know everything about the lady I'm trying to get next to. Get next to? Excuse me. Good luck with that, not too many people have been so lucky. I don't really let many in. You push them away. And I've been in the foster care system my whole life. I don't know, I guess you could say I have problems. I live off of Lamar and Guadalupe. Oh that's not too far from my job site. You seem like a real go-getter. Hell yeah. My daddy told me, "Ain't nobody gonna give you nothing." You and your daddy real close? Pretty much. I mean, I know he ain't gonna be around much longer. Sometimes I look at the stars and I wonder, you know what, when my daddy dies, what star he's gonna become, you know? I'll look at that star and I'll say, okay daddy, it's just me and you now, watch over me and show me the way. Anyways, what about you? You know your folks? Well I only caught a glimpse of my mom before she was critically burned. Oh, yeah? Yeah, she was freebasing in a crack house when it caught fire. And my dad was a king pin, now he's doing a 20 year bid. Man, that is deep. You should write a book. Hey, I'll be your agent. Okay. You can stop right here. I had a really good time tonight. It's not often that I meet a girl that I can open up and share things like that with you know? I'd like to take you out again if you're up for it. See ya. Hey there, hon. My name's Janice. Would you like some personal hygiene items? I have some soap, some deodorant, some tampons. Thank you so much. - Yeah, no problem. - I really appreciate it. Ma'am, you can't stop here and give away stuff to the homeless people. You gotta keep going. You can't give supplies or money to them. They're just gonna use it on drugs or alcohol. You can get assaulted out here. You gotta keep going. Okay, well you stay safe out here, hon. There's a lot of human traffickers, okay? All right. Working for Slim is the worst. I haven't gotten a raise unless you count my blood pressure. What the hell! You eat my food! Slim, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. Okay. It's time for you to go. I haven't eaten nothing all week. If I could pay you back, I would, I promise. I'm so sorry, Slim. Here's your week's earnings. - Please. - Now get out of here! And I don't want to ever see your face around here again. - I'll pay you back. - Get out! Go! Get out! She's going eat my food. Breaking the bank. Vimeo, Cash App, everything you got girl. Oh my God, girl, you got talent. Ah-huh, out the heels all in my face. All in, baby, make it shake. Oh, no, oh, no. I'm the one talking slang, I got to the left. What's up with Shorty? When she coming back through? Hey D, I gotta holler at you. I haven't seen her in a minute. She's done coming back through here. And honestly, so are you. I gotta open up VIP for the rest of the patrons and the girls. That ain't what I motherfucking asked you. And I'm not done coming back to this motherfucking Spot. Now tell me where G Spot at yo. Hey, that's my girl Caramel's deal, okay? I don't need any more drama at my house, all right? I'm in too deep, man. This is not the deal we had. But see the deal was you keep allowing us to book in the VIP, call up any goddamn girl that I see fit and I leave your girl alone. And I gave you my word. So if, if you trying to block me, remember and I mean remember, I won't hesitate to put your ass on social media. Hey, you gonna get tab from someone else, Big D. I don't know where she at. Uh-uh. Dino. Yeah. That nigger didn't pay me. - Who? - Him. That nigger right there. Oh, I got this, boo. Watch this. All right. Punk ass motherfucker. Do not run up on me like that, homie. This is re right here homie. That's straight up, nigger. Fuck that bitch. And I don't give a fuck, homie. I ain't did to shit to her. Man, fuck, man, fuck you, homie. Ah, shit my arm, man! Get your, get your weak ass up. - Oh, man! - Motherfucker, you wanna see Jesus? Man, that's fucked up, man. Take this motherfucking money and shit. Here, man. Let me go, man. I was just fucking around and shit, man. Fuck that. - Yo, motherfucker! - You got your money, man! You got your shit, man! - Yo. - Man, you gotta get the fuck out my face! Hey! Hey! That's my stuff! That's my stuff! That's my stuff. Fuck! That looks nice. Thanks. I used to be Carmen. I died nine years ago. I'm Rhee. Hello, Rhee. It's nice to meet you, formally that is. Taking up hobbies is real hard. Quitting is much easier. Hey! What's uh, what's, what's with the butterflies? It's a symbol of hope for me. Hey, why are you doing that? Uh. Marlboro. Winston. I'm, I'm looking for Pall Mall. Good luck. Hey, just so you know, if you don't have an inside corner, the weather can kill you. Okay. Hey, Gina. Hey, girl. Um, I heard what happened at Slims. I can't believe he would sweat you over some old barbecue. So what are you gonna do for work now? It's, it's all good. I'm a big girl, I'll be okay. You know what? I'll stop by tomorrow and I'll bring you some groceries, okay? And hey, you know you might want to come back to the club. I still think you can do good there. I mean I've been making over $3,000 on the weekends. Woohoo, yep! That's a Pall Mall. Buddy, only smokes Pall Malls. Is there anything I can do? No, I'm good Gina. But, uh, hey I need you to do me one favor. Hey, Doc. When? Goddammit. So nice being in touch with nature. Girl, this is a really good butterfly picture. I didn't know you could draw. I didn't know I could draw either. You'd be surprised what you can do when you put your mind to it. Hey girl, thanks so much for giving me like the new clothes, and groceries, and letting me shower at your place. I really, really appreciate it. You don't have to thank me, Rhee. Oh, how close are we to getting Milo back? Miles away. So you miss Nick, don't you? Yeah. I can only imagine. So is there anyone new that you're talking to? Um, no, well kind of, not really. I mean it's like not verbally, I don't, I don't know. I mean either it's a yes or a no. I mean I know I saw this really cute guy come over by Slims and talk to you outside for a while. How did that go? I mean, things went where they're supposed to go I guess. Did things go south? I mean, things went where they were supposed to go, I guess. Well, things will develop in due time if you want it bad enough. Do you believe in the laws of attraction? I believe in destiny. You know, if something's meant to be, it'll work out. I believe we can attract good things if we visualize them. You know, I created a vision board that way I can visualize all, you know my blessings as they manifest. And I know you believe in the same thing. You know, that day at Slim's Bar, I was just ready to give up. He had me so upset. But you told me to focus on success and that things will materialize. And that really got me to want practice the laws of attraction. I mean, I wish I did it sooner. Like things would've been a whole lot better. Hey, can I make a confession? Yeah. You remember in third grade and Mrs. Stillman's class? I used to cheat off your geography paper all the time. Oh my God, I never knew that. But I mean you were the one that went to college after all so. I mean, college really wasn't for me. I mean I had so much pain growing up. You think all the times that I would shoplift my designer jeans, my mom would ask where I was getting my clothes from. But never once, she never listened. You know, I know she had her own share of problems going through the divorce. It's not so much as it is from being poor than it was from the neglect. You had it worse off than me. But you never stole anything. And that's integrity. It's so unique. You know, the reason I throw myself into all these projects is to get away from the pain. I think the best aspirin for pain is success. Travis wants kids someday. And I'd hate to bring a child in this world knowing I don't have the money, let alone the patience or the time for one. You know, I was smart on paper. You were really the smart one. You taught me to believe in myself. There's always a reward for believing in yourself. You've been my best friend. Gina, you've always been my closest friend. I mean, that's the whole reason I asked Nick to move out here. You know, I wanted to be closer to you. I get to go see Milo next week. Yay. Oh my gosh. Oh, give him that Christmas gift that I got him and a big hug for me, okay? Of course, you know I will. I'm sure he's missed you so much. Yeah, you know what? I've missed the crap out of him too. Yeah. So much. Well, as soon as I get him back, we should have a big old play date with Travis's kids. Yes. Merry Christmas, Carmen. Merry Christmas, Rhee. Oh, thank you. Merry Christmas, buddy. Merry Christmas, y'all. You know what hell is? It's knowing that you ain't no good. Even your own kids don't know their mom. Yeah man, I got that tab on this 20 piece. Oh yeah, sitting north. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's a green light. Yeah, I'm over here off of Lamar. Yeah. Yeah, she over here like a sitting duck. Yeah, just make sure the next movie is your best move. Yeah, make it happen. No, no, no. No. Ooh. - Mommy. - Yeah. Am I going home with you? Not today, sweetheart, but one day you will, I promise. Here, here comes some more super fish. You want it come here. Playing with two. Oh, put it down, put it down. Come on, come on, we gotta go, we gotta go. Okay. All right, look at the little at the little parrots. Yeah. And the red one. Which one do you like better the red or the green? Uh, yeah, but that- - You like that one. - That, that, that's the most neat. Bye, baby. Hey! Look, you took a lot of people's stuff. Can you at least tell me- - Where the hell is my tent? - Whoa, whoa. - Where's my stuff? Whoa, whoa, whoa, relax. Look, they did a sweep, okay? They took everybody's stuff, not just yours. Look, we're gonna find your stuff, all right? We're gonna find it and we'll find you a place to stay tonight. Hey, hey let me work on it. I'll, I'll figure something out. Hey, I don't make the rules, I just enforce them. As you can see, there's the pool, laundry room. Back over this way is the gym. We require first and last month's rent as the deposit after the fifth there's a late fee. You have any questions? No. What kind of work do you do? Oh, I, I work from home. Okay. Have a seat. Thanks for coming by. So I see you have a GED. Excuse me. I see you've done sales before. What types of sales have you done? Uh, I worked at a clothing store. So we, we sold clothes. Any experience selling appliances or furniture? I see you're able to work nights and weekends. That's always a good thing. I'll have to tell my store manager that, he'll love that. I do know we have an opening in appliances and you wouldn't need much experience for that. I'll talk to my boss if we can bring you on. Okay, thanks for coming by. We're here for the case of Rhee Gonzalez seeking to restore custody of your son. Your Honor, I will turn it over to my client and let her speak for herself. Ms. Gonzalez, can you please tell the courts what you've done to improve your living conditions and parenting skills? Have you attended any parent classes? No, Your Honor. Have you found a permanent place of residence? Have you found a permanent place of residence? No, Your honor. Well I'm afraid you haven't done anything to demonstrate you're suited to regain custody of your son. I'm afraid this request is denied. Look Gina, you're Caramel in here. Anything else doesn't matter. This is a job at the end of the day. This is gonna help you get ahead. Tonight's gonna be a good night. You're not gonna worry about Dino not letting you into VIP 'cause without VIP you still make that money, okay? You're not gonna worry about Travis taking Dino side and you're not gonna worry about any of them petty jobs that you have on the side. Okay. Yo, babe, what's up? What's up? Me and my homeboy wanna have threesome. I don't do escort. Oh, come on, it's 250, what's up? No. Come on, girl. Come on now, 250, what's up? Get the fuck off me. Oh, shit. Hey, man, get your ass out of here, man. Gina, Gina why'd you leave early? You don't have to leave early. Baby girl, are you okay? I'm good. Hey, you wanna play some pool? Play some quality time? Hey, the angels are flying live tonight. Hey, a hundred bucks. A hundred bucks. Please, God let me grow big beautiful wings so I can rise above this madness like a butterfly. Hey, if you don't have an inside corner, the weather can kill you. Buddy. Is that you? Oh, thank you, Buddy. Thank you so much. Thank you, Buddy. Thank you so much. Hey, Slim, can I ask you a question? What is it? You, you think about taking the vacation anytime soon? Vacation? With all these bills I got, I can't afford no vacation. Look, what are you getting at? If you got something to say, just say it. Isn't your lease up here soon? Why you ask? Well I was thinking why don't I make you an offer and take over the the place and when you, your lease is up I can negotiate new terms with the property manager. So what do you got the offer? I mean how much are we talking? Huh. Uh, I was thinking 25K and once the lease is up, I can negotiate a term with the property manager. Look, I'm going through a divorce and I'm facing bankruptcy. I need more than 25K. Tell you what, make it 30K, let me keep my food truck out front. Ah, and we got ourselves to deal. How about 30K and you can take your food truck elsewhere and you got yourself a deal. Ain't that, we got ourselves a deal. Look, all my personal problems, let's not tell that to anybody. All right, let's keep that between us, okay? Oh my God, Slim, you know I'm not like that. I would not. So you sure you wanna do this? Yeah, I'm sure. I told you I had to keep the VIP open to other patrons and the girls. How you going to walk away from all this paper, yo? I ain't never knew you was some type of little symp like this. Be your own man dog. Come on, boss. Look, ain't symping here, D. I just gotta protect the club and its reputation. I could lose my job and my girl, she can get banned from dancing here forever. The owner's a no nonsense guy. Okay, whenever they done be found, you'll be batting, huh, huh, watch. Yeah. Oh my God, Clay. What the hell are you doing here? I heard tent life could be quite exciting. So why didn't you tell me? I saw you come out of your tent after I got off of work. My job site's right across the street. You want to understand homelessness. I finally understand why people lose their minds out here. Sometimes I wish I could do the same. Like Buddy, he goes around and he picks up old cigarette butts and he gets so excited when he finds his favorite brand, it makes his entire day. You know, if you needed a place to stay all you- - Look, I have pride, okay? I mean I know what it's like to have missed meal cramps once in a while. Well, missed meal cramps ain't what I'm worried about. Hell, I grew up poor. Adapting to this shitty life that's what I'm terrified of. And you want to understand that? I'm afraid of having nothing to give! And right now I have nothing to give! And you wanna understand that. I wouldn't understand. No, no, you drive around in this nice truck, you have a place to sleep at night, you have a bed to lay on. You have food that you can eat. Don't even know what it would feel like to have pressure hit you in your face. Yeah, I wouldn't understand pressure. No! Yeah, you try to take care of an old man while he is dying! Run his construction business! Having people breathing down your neck day after day, trying to meet deadlines! Everyone's under pressure, Rhee. It's called life. Hey, Gina. Hey, girl. I got great news. I just bought Slim's Bar and Grill. I saved up all my money dancing at the club, you know, and I just made him offer he couldn't refuse. That's fantastic. Congratulations, I'm so happy for you. Thank you. I thought you were gonna buy a hair salon. I mean I still am. I just figured since I'm already here, you know, why not? You know, might as well. This gets me out of the club, which is what I ultimately want anyways. And you know, this gives the girls, you know, better opportunities for work and you know, why not work at the bar now? Listen, okay, just really listen. I wanna hire you back. I, I can't. I mean, Slim fired me. He doesn't want me working there. Girl, ain't you heard a word of what I just said. I bought him out. He's no longer working there. I am the owner. Oh, Gina, that's fantastic. I'm so happy for you. So where is Slim going? Ugh, he bought some food truck and he took it to a new location so he's going to the catering. Well good for him. Well congratulations. Thank you, I couldn't have done without you. All right girl, bye. - Hey Daisy. - Hi. Remember when you taught me this move when I first got here? Let me see. Yes. Oh my gosh, I'm gonna miss it. It's okay. This wasn't for me forever. I understand. Can't believe it. I know this day has finally come and I worked so hard in here. And you know what? I wouldn't have done any of this without you giving me the opportunity to work here and get the money I needed for student loans, for the vision I have for myself. I know. I couldn't have done any of this without you. I believed in you. And I appreciate that really so much. You don't know how much. You're gonna make me cry. Gimme a hug. Oh my gosh. I'm gonna miss you guys and the girls. I'm gonna miss you too. Oh, my gosh. Please come by my bar anytime you want to. I really am. Free drinks, free cater food, you name it. So excited. I can't wait to see it. Oh my God, you should just see the layout is gonna be crazy. - I'm so happy. - I have so many ideas. I'm really happy for you. I wish your business so much success. Thank you. You know that means a lot to me. I know, I know, all right. Oh my gosh. Look, we really need to get you into a parenting class. We have to show the judge that you're following all of the necessary protocols to regaining custody of your son. The fact that you don't have a criminal record is just short of amazing. I don't need no parenting class to be a good mom, okay? Rhee, it's what's necessary. Well, it's how the game is played. We get you into this class, you get a steady job, and a stable home. I ain't going to no parenting class, all right! I am a good mother and always been a good mother. I have never been so lonely in my whole life. All I need is my son back. Look, it's time you stop feeling sorry for yourself. Let me fill you in on a Japanese word that you need to take to heart. Jiko ai. It means self-love and that's all you truly need, Rhee. This is about devising a plan to get your son back so he doesn't get caught up in the system and become another statistic like you. Oh, hey, hon, how you been? Oh, yeah, give me just a second. There you go. Looks like you're coming along just fine. You have a good one. Children would rather be praised and punished but rather punished than ignored. They need our love, time, and attention. Wouldn't you agree? Rhee, wouldn't you agree? Uh, yeah, I guess so. Can you remember a time when your child made a gift for you or when you made a gift for your parents and how did that make you feel? Uh, yeah, so I don't have kids, but when I was little, my mom, she was a single mom and she was studying to become a lawyer. So whenever she got a little too busy I would make dinner for us. It just felt really nice to help out, you know? Yeah, that's so nice. Um, I just had a daughter that just had a birthday. Um, one of the first things she got was this bracelet making kit and she made one for me and it was just so awesome. That's great. Well my little guy just started preschool and so I got my first, I love mom writing and so that was really sweet. Made me feel appreciated. - Fantastic. - Yeah. Yes, thank you. Uh, Rhee, can you share a time? Um, well, one time, not too long ago, my little boy drew a picture of a butterfly and it was, it was really special. Really a butterfly? Did the butterfly have any significance to you? Well, yeah, I mean it, it was just, I don't know, it was just really special to me. I don't know. Yeah, that is special. And so thoughtful too. Yeah, I always keep it on me for good luck. That's wonderful. The gifts we receive from our children can really be a source of inspiration. So tell me, Rhee, what gifts do you think you can offer your child? Well, when I first lost my boy, I didn't think I had anything to offer him. And now I have a whole treasure chest. I don't know, I guess it just, I guess it just took me losing myself to truly find myself again. Thank you so much for this job success. I needed it. You don't even know, girl. - It's no problem. - All right. I love the new aprons, thank you. Thank you. Well, you brought this on yourself. Come on, Gina, I could, I could be an assistant or something. And you can't work here, I'm full staff. Look, Travis, I told you, the man was gonna let you go sooner or later. You keep rotating the same girls in VIP. Come on, Gina, I, I can be an assistant or something. I don't eat where I shit. We tried that before, remember? Come on, Gina, I could wash the dishes. I'll do anything. Hello. Hello. Well, sir, your pipes are all corroded. You don't want us to repipe the building we'll have to get some sulfuric acid to blow those rusty pipes out. Yes, I can get some today. All right, thank you very much. Talk to you later now. - Hi. - Hey. Got a split personality or something? Dancer, server, bartender. I do what's necessary. I don't mean to be a bug. I was kind of hoping I could take you out on one last dinner date. Since my daddy died I'm selling the business, I'm moving back home next week. Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. Why didn't you tell me sooner? That sounds familiar. You okay? Yeah, well, I'm just tired from being pretending to be stronger than I actually feel. I got deadlines to meet, crew to pay, and all the while I'm still grieving my daddy. Sure. We can go out again, it'll be fine. But why didn't you tell me? You got enough problems to deal with, let alone deal with mine. Well, tell me this, what's the greatest thing your daddy ever taught you? Character. Character. Well then get through this and grow your wings. See you are in this cocoon right now and cocoons are made from pain, and some cocoons last longer than others. But you can't let something as weak as a cocoon break you. You have to let it mold you. I don't know, I just, I just see all those pretty colors on those wings and I think that if God can turn a caterpillar into a beautiful butterfly, then he could do the same for us. There's, there's a lot of life under those wings, you just gotta let it be free. Anyway, I'll, I'll meet you at my community tonight. Yeah, I'll pick you up around six. Sounds good. Well, hello there Ms. Congeniality. How are you doing? I'm doing great. That's wonderful. You look like you're serving behind the bar now. You still got those breakfast tacos you used to have. No, but I can make you any drink that you like. You know something, I'm sure glad that I just ran into you. Uh, I missed you last couple of times I've come down here and got myself a problem. It seems like my daughter wants to leave the business and now I've got no one to replace her. And I think I might be looking at a pretty strong candidate standing right in front of me. Oh wow. Hey, you gotta be interested. I'd be paying you top dollar. You'd be able to eat as well as anybody. You'd be able to have a residency up until the time that you need to go and find a place to live. Will you at least consider it? Oh my God. I, I would love to run your business, sir. Well, call me Tex, don't call me sir. You know you have made me a happy camper. Here's my business card and I'm sorry I'm taking you away from your employer. I'm sure you're probably a very good worker here. Tell her I'm sorry. I will. All right. See you later. Bye. Man, where the fuck they at? I don't know dude, my fucking stomach hurts. I told you to get a salad. Fuck you. Whatever bitch, fuck you. Dick. Isn't that it right there, man? Yeah man, that's them fools, man. I ain't got time for no bullshit, man. You ain't come this far to get no damn, a fail job. Yeah man, I get this taken care of man soon. It's a beautiful night out here tonight. Yeah, it's gorgeous. Some nice piece of artwork you got there on your arm. Thanks, dog. Yeah, Dragon, huh? Yes sir. What you looking to get done? Yeah man, tryin' get this nice little cream pie, weigh about 115, slim waist, long hair, brown hair. Yeah, man, can y'all boys handle that? Easy. Easy. So what the, what them chips talking about? We need at least 10. 10? You want it done right? - How about 75? - Nah, 10. So we talking 10 man. What y'all going pick her up in? The van. What's that going to do? Girl, we gotta get this money in Vegas, man. Gotta make sure we do right though. Oh yeah, we gonna do it right. Smooth, man, smooth. We got a nice stable as you can see that we going have down there. There's a whole lot of ducks that need to be plucked if you know what I mean? - Yeah. - Yeah. So it's a whole lot of Johns, a whole lot of high rollers, so we gonna make it happen. Gonna make it do with a do. Gonna make our next move, our best move. Ain't that right, Finesse? That's right. Yeah, So what I need y'all to do, I need you to get the girls a stable right. Get them nice head to toe. We gonna make it happen. So here you go. Yeah, yeah. Hey that looks like her right there. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Have you seen her? The butterfly girl? Butter, butterfly girl? Yes, where did they take her? They took her out of a van and took her into that warehouse over there. Over there. Okay, I need you to call the cops right now! Right now! Hey, man, think I hear someone. Think I hear somebody outside, man. Huh? I think I hear someone outside. So why the fuck you telling me. I got you, I'll go check it out. - Go check it out. - Yeah. Dammit. Shh, shh, shh. Clay! So you think going take her that easy, huh? All right, big pimping. Don't be a pussy, fight me like a man. Clay! Fucking asshole. Motherfucker! Go, go, go! Go, go, go! Why didn't you tell me he had goons after you? It's about a debt I owed, okay? I borrowed money from Dino at the club and I didn't pay him back so he was gonna keep me as a sex worker. It's the rules of the street. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is that why you haven't returned my calls? No. No, it has nothing to do with that. Maybe you should stay at my place for a while. All right, all right, shit. Oh, no. Oh my god. What's going on? What happened? Dino had me kidnapped, he had us bound up. Are, are you all right? I can't stay long. I can't put you at risk. What are you gonna do? She's gonna stay with me for a while. Okay, let me, let me grab your things real quick. Hold on. It's okay, it's okay. Oh my gosh. Thank you. Call me as soon as you get somewhere safe. - I will. - I'm so sorry this happened, Rhee. - It's okay. - Oh my God. You guys be careful. - We will. - Call me if you need anything. Thank you. - Bye, Gina. - Thank you. - Be careful. - Bye. Oh, my God. How are you doing? I'm doing okay. Let me see. I mean this might hurt. Ow. I'm so sorry I got you into this. That's okay. Real quick. I think you dropped that. Where did you find this? It was just on the ground outside. Thank you. This means so much to me. I think I'm gonna go to the other room. You can stay in the bed if you want. No, that's okay. I don't wanna, I don't wanna put you out of your bed. I can go to the other room, that's fine. Or you can stay with me. If you want to. Hello, Jasmine. Listen Rhee, I just got off the phone with your attorney, you have another hearing next month. I have another hearing next month, okay. So I need to know if you are clean and are your associates clean? Yes, I've been clean and yes, all my associates are clean. Are you still working? Uh-huh. And how are you living arrangements? Are you still living on the street? Because if we can prove your work stability and place of residence, I think we have a chance for you to get Milo back. Okay, sure. Okay, sounds good, thank you so much. Okay, bye. Everything okay? Yeah, that was my case manager, Jasmine. She said I have another hearing next month and I could get my boy back. But I have to pass a drug test and I have to have proof of residence and employment. Why don't you just tell him you live here. I'll vouch for you. Sure. Yeah, absolutely. Okay, well let me call Tex and see if he still has that job for me. Hi, Tex, this is Rhee Gonzalez. Um, I was wondering if you still had that job position available. You do. Okay, great. Yeah, that, that sounds wonderful. Oh my gosh, yeah, that would be so great. You have a great day as well. Buh-bye. Oh my gosh. Yes, he's gonna give me the job, and he's gonna pay for me to get out there, and I'll have full time and pay time off so I can hang out with Milo. Well congratulations. But, uh, what about us? Where does that leave us? Well, this might sound a little crazy, but what if you came out there with us? I'm sure Tex could get you a job at the hotel too. I mean, I think I have an uncle who has a ranch down there. I just gotta close up a few jobs and then I can definitely make it there with you. This is gonna be so much fun. So are you ready for the hearing tomorrow? I really hope so, but I've done everything that I can do on God's green Earth to get Milo back into my arms for good. I just really hope the judge can see that. Yeah, I mean, you've come a long way, pretty lady. And you know, I'm so proud of you. You know, you really helped me too. There was a time where I confused standards for values and I didn't know what happiness was, you know, until I figured out happiness was creating opportunities for others and myself. And as long as I do that, you know, I'll always be a success. You'll always be a success girl. You know what? This is what we've been working for. Just be courteous, respectful, truthful. Yeah. How are you feeling? I'm nervous, but I'm ready. That's okay. You got this. You got this, come here. You got this, okay. Okay. Let's go get him, Rhee. Okay, let's go. Ms. Gonzalez, can you please tell the courts how you've approved your life skills to better provide a more suitable environment for your son since your last hearing? Your Honor, my client has a place of residence. She's found employment and she's attending parenting classes. I see. And how have you managed to make such strides in so little time, Ms. Gonzalez? With hard work and my strong will to get my son back. Ms. Gonzalez, tell me this, what single attribute have you acquired to offer to this young man? That is, if you were indeed to regain custody of your son. Character, your honor, character. Character, huh? You know, character is what truly defines us, young lady. I do see that you've taken the initiative to attend parenting classes, obtain steady employment with a stable environment to suit. Taking all of this into consideration with the dramatic improvement and your attitude and demeanor by the power vested in me in the great state of Texas, your request to regain custody of your son is granted. Hey, Slim, I told you I'd pay you back. I always keep my promises. Look what the wind done blew in. What is this for? It's for the barbecue. Oh, the barbecue. All right, I got a pocket full of cash. My crew's all paid off and we finish our last job ahead of schedule. Let's hit this. I don't know if butterfly's always free. I don't know if it always makes the best choices in life. I just know that I went through one hell of a cocoon to get my freedom. Thing about it is I got my wings.
