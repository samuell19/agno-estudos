♪ HEY, MR. DEEJAY, WON'T YOU TURN THAT HIGH? ♪ ♪ WON'T YOU TURN THAT? ♪ PLEASE, WON'T YOU TURN THAT ♪ WON'T YOU TURN THAT? ♪ PLEASE, WON'T YOU TURN THAT? ♪ PLEASE ♪ PLEASE WON'T YOU TURN THAT? LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER FOR D.L. HUGHLEY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HEY, NOW. HOW Y'ALL DOING, MIAMI?! THAT IS VERY NICE. I AM GLAD TO BE HERE IN CUBA. DON'T NOBODY SPEAK ENGLISH HERE, HUH? QUé? I'VE NEVER BEEN TO CUBA, BUT I GOT TO ASSUME IT'S A PRETTY FUCKED-UP PLACE 'CAUSE CUBANS WILL LEAVE CUBA WITHOUT A BOAT. THEY JUST WALK OUT TO THE BEACH. [ Hispanic accent ] "I LEAVING TODAY." [ Normal voice ] YOU DON'T HAVE A BOAT. [ Hispanic accent ] "I NO NEED BOAT. I LEAVE TODAY." [ Normal voice ] THEY WILL FLOAT ON ANYTHING. I TURNED ON THE NEWS, SAW SIX OF THEM CUBANS FLOATING ON A HAITIAN DUDE. AIN'T THAT A BITCH? THEY GOT TO STAY. HE HAD TO GO RIGHT BACK. THANKS FOR THE RIDE, PIERRE. I'M GLAD TO BE HERE. SHAQ IS HERE. GIVE IT UP FOR SHAQ. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HE'S DOING COMEDY. HE'S PRODUCING COMEDY NOW. I HOPE THIS TURNS OUT BETTER THAN HIS CLOTHING LINE. THAT WAS FUCKED UP, WASN'T IT? [ CHUCKLES ] THAT MOTHERFUCKER SOLD TWO PAIR OF SHORTS. [ LAUGHS ] LET ME STOP. SHAQ WILL BE ABLE TO COME UP HERE AND KICK MY ASS. I DRESS LIKE A FREE THROW, AND THAT MOTHERFUCKER WILL NEVER HIT ME. [ LAUGHTER ] LET ME STOP FUCKING AROUND. HOW YOU DOING, DAMON? DAMON JONES. GIVE HIM A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE. FUCK ARE YOU, A CAUTION LIGHT? AIN'T THAT A BITCH? SCHOOL BUSES DRIVE BY -- "WE SHOULD STOP." LET ME STOP FUCKING AROUND. LOT OF ATHLETES ARE IN TROUBLE, MAN. IT'S REALLY FUCKED UP. IT'S HARD FOR THEM NOW. LIKE, MICHAEL PHELPS, THE OLYMPIC SWIMMER, WE LOVED HIM WHEN HE WAS WINNING GOLD AND GLORY FOR THE COUNTRY. FOUND OUT HE WAS SMOKING A BONG, AND EVERYBODY LOST THEIR GODDAMN MIND. NOW THIS MOTHERFUCKER WON SEVEN GOLD MEDALS SMOKING WEED. KNOW WHAT THAT TELL YOU? SMOKING WEED MAKE YOU SWIM FAST. THAT'S ALL THE FUCK I KNOW. I DIDN'T KNOW I BEEN TRAINING FOR THE OLYMPICS ALL THIS TIME. YOU GOT TO BE HIGH TO WEAR THOSE SPEEDOS. AND THEN KELLOGG'S CANCELED HIS ENDORSEMENT, WHICH IS DUMB 'CAUSE THE ONLY TIME I EAT CEREAL IS WHEN I'M HIGH. AIN'T THAT A BITCH? [ LAUGHTER ] IF YOU SEE A GROWN MAN WITH A BOWL OF FROSTED FLAKES, HE'S FUCKED UP, THAT'S ALL. I'VE BEEN SO HIGH I TRIED TO MAKE A SANDWICH OUT OF FROSTED FLAKES. WE SHOULD BE HAPPY TO HAVE ATHLETES. ATHLETES THE ONLY ONES WORKING. AIN'T NOBODY ELSE. EVERYBODY FUCKING -- IF YOU HAVE A JOB NOW, YOU HAPPY TO HAVE IT. REMEMBER THAT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] REMEMBER YEARS AGO, YOU WOULD TALK SHIT? "FUCK THIS JOB. I DON'T NEED THIS GODDAMN JOB. I CAN GET ANOTHER JOB." NOW EVEN BLACK PEOPLE GET TO WORK EARLY. "HEY, MR. JOHNSON. JUST WANTED YOU KNOW I WAS HERE BEFORE I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. JUST IN CASE Y'ALL LAYING OFF, JUST NOTICE I WAS HERE." WE ARE BROKE. WE SO BROKE, I SAW THREE MEXICANS SWIMMING OVER TO HAITI LIKE, "FUCK THIS SHIT. WE CAN'T STAY HERE. THIS SHIT IS RIDICULOUS." BUT SOME GOOD THINGS HAVE HAPPENED RECENTLY. LIKE DUGAR WAS SAYING, WE HAVE A BLACK PRESIDENT NOW. THAT HAPPENED. THAT WAS GOOD FOR US. AND WHITE PEOPLE FINALLY GOT O.J., SO THEY HAPPY ABOUT THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] GEORGE BUSH. YOU KNOW YOU'RE A SHITTY PRESIDENT WHEN THE WHOLE COUNTRY GO, "WE GONNA TRY THE BLACK DUDE NEXT. FUCK THIS SHIT." [ LAUGHTER ] GEORGE BUSH WENT TO IRAQ, AND THEY THREW SHOES AT HIM. AIN'T THAT A BITCH? DID YOU REMEMBER? NEWS REPORTERS IN THE ARAB WORLD, THROWING A SHOW WAS THE HIGHEST FORM OF INSULT. MOTHERFUCKER, ANYWHERE YOU GO, THROWING A SHOE IS THE HIGHEST FORM OF INSULT. IT'S JUST WORSE IN THE ARAB WORLD 'CAUSE THEY WEAR SANDALS. [ LAUGHTER ] EVERYBODY'S IN TROUBLE, MAN. CHRIS BROWN IS IN TROUBLE NOW. PEOPLE ARE ANGRY WITH CHRIS BROWN BECAUSE HE HAD AN ALTERCATION WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND. AND THEY SAID CHRIS BROWN WAS A ROLE MODEL. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. CHRIS BROWN IS A 19-YEAR-OLD BOY. IF YOU HAVE A 19-YEAR-OLD CHILD AS YOUR FUCKING ROLE MODEL, YOU A GODDAMN IDIOT. THAT'S THE FUCK YOU ARE. I GOT A 19-YEAR-OLD SON. I DON'T LEAVE THAT FUCKER AT HOME BY HISSELF. "WHY DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHERE I'M AT?" 'CAUSE YOU'RE 19, YOU SON OF A BITCH. THAT'S NOT TO NEGATE WHAT HE DID. CHRIS BROWN IS A YOUNG MAN, AND HE'LL UNDERSTAND WHEN HE'S OLDER THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER PUT YOUR HANDS ON A WOMAN. EVERYBODY WILL UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT SOME WOMEN GOT TO LEARN WHEN TO SHUT THE FUCK UP. THAT'S ALL THE FUCK I'M SAYING. 'CAUSE I'VE NEVER SEEN A QUIET WOMAN GET CHOKED. THAT'S ALL THE FUCK I NOTICE. [ LAUGHTER ] "I CAN'T BREATHE." YOU SHOULD HUSH. FUCK, HUSH. EVERYTHING'S FUCKED UP, MAN. I'M GLAD THE ELECTION'S OVER, MAN. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE I FEEL BAD FOR. I FEEL BAD FOR JOHN McCAIN. GOT TO BE ROUGH WHEN YOU'RE THE FIRST WHITE GUY TO LOSE THE PRESIDENCY TO A BLACK GUY. THAT GOT TO BE FUCKED UP AT THE COUNTRY CLUB. "HEY, FELLAS." "HEY, JOHN..." [ LAUGHTER ] REMEMBER HOW GOOD SARAH PALIN WAS DOING TILL THEY FOUND OUT SHE DIDN'T KNOW A GODDAMN THING? REMEMBER WHEN THE COUNTRY -- "SHE DON'T KNOW SHIT, DOES SHE?!" "FROM ALASKA, I CAN SEE RUSSIA." WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN? FROM MY HOUSE I CAN SEE THE MOON, BUT I AIN'T A FUCKING ASTRONAUT. [ LAUGHTER ] JESSE JACKSON GOT IN TROUBLE. REMEMBER THAT SHIT? JESSE FUCKED AROUND, FORGOT THAT MICROPHONE WAS ON. REMEMBER THAT? "OBAMA'S TALKING DOWN TO BLACK PEOPLE. HAS THIS THING BEEN ON THE WHOLE TIME? SHIT. I'M GONNA HAVE TO GET A JOB NOW. THIS IS BULLSHIT." JESSE WAS JEALOUS OF OBAMA. THAT'S ALL THE FUCK IT WAS. 'CAUSE JESSE RAN FOR PRESIDENT IN '88, AND THAT'S EXACTLY HOW MANY MOTHERFUCKERS VOTED FOR HIM -- 88. [ LAUGHTER ] "I DEMAND A RECOUNT!" JESSE, WE CAN ALL COUNT TO 88. EVERYBODY THAT VOTED FOR YOU RODE ON THE SAME CHURCH BUS. NOW GET IN THE GODDAMN CAR. COME ON. THEN HE GOT CAUGHT ON FOX NEWS SAYING THE WORD "NIGGER," A WORD HE BOYCOTTED MICHAEL RICHARDS FOR THE PREVIOUS YEAR. NOW, I UNDERSTAND "NIGGER" IS A HORRIBLE WORD, AND I CERTAINLY WILL BE GLAD WHEN THEY DO AWAY WITH IT, BUT UNTIL THEY DO, IT DOES DESCRIBE SOME MOTHERFUCKERS I KNOW SO PERFECTLY, DON'T IT? EVERYBODY KNOW AT LEAST ONE MOTHERFUCKER. EVERY TIME YOU SEE HIM COMING -- "OH, THIS NIGGER HERE. GODDAMN." LOOK AT ALL THE WHITE FOLK. "I WISH I COULD SAY THAT." YOU CAN, JUST DON'T DO IT HERE. DO IT IN YOUR CAR LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO. "NIGGER." [ IMITATES ENGINE REVVING ] "JESUS, THEY'RE FAST. THESE SONS OF BITCHES ARE FAST." YOU EVER WATCH THE NEWS, YOU CAN TELL WHAT COLOR A PERSON IS BY THE WAY THEY GET KILLED. LIKE DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS, POLICE SHOOTINGS -- ALWAYS US. SHARK ATTACKS -- NEVER FUCKING US. IF A SHARK WANT TO KILL A BLACK PERSON, THEY GOT TO LEARN HOW TO DO A DRIVE-BY. "CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE SUSPECT?" "IT WAS A SHARK." 'CAUSE SHIT HAPPEN TO WHITE FOLK DON'T HAPPEN TO NO-FUCKING-BODY ELSE. LIKE IN FLORIDA A YEAR AGO, THERE WAS A WOMAN SWIMMING IN A BOAT, AND A STINGRAY JUMPED IN THE BOAT AND STABBED HER TO DEATH. THAT'LL NEVER TO HAPPEN TO BLACK PEOPLE. WE AIN'T GONNA FUCK WITH A FISH WITH A KNIFE. "MOTHERFUCKER. THAT FISH GOT A KNIFE. LET'S GO. FUCK THAT. WHAT IS THAT, A PUERTO RICAN FISH? FUCK THIS SHIT." [ LAUGHTER ] SOMEBODY ALWAYS GETTING ATTACKED BY A MOUNTAIN LION IN CALIFORNIA. LAST YEAR A 75-YEAR-OLD MAN WAS ATTACKED BY A MOUNTAIN LION. HIS 65-YEAR-OLD WIFE BEAT THE MOUNTAIN LION OFF HER HUSBAND AND SAVED HIS LIFE. I LOVE MY WIFE, BUT IF SHE EVER ATTACKED BY A MOUNTAIN LION, WHAT AM I TO DO? [ LAUGHTER ] IF I THROW A ROCK AT THE MOUNTAIN LION, IT MIGHT ATTACK ME. AND THEN THE KIDS WON'T HAVE NO PARENTS. YOU GOT TO DO IT 'CAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE WORKING. LAST YEAR IN SAN FRANCISCO, A TIGER BROKE OUT OF THE ZOO, ATTACKED THREE PEOPLE, NONE OF THEM BLACK. NOW, I'M SURE BLACK PEOPLE WAS AT THE ZOO THAT DAY, BUT WE TRUST OUR INSTINCTS. "MOTHERFUCKER, THAT'S A TIGER. LET'S GO. FUCK THAT SHIT. I RECOGNIZE HIM FROM THE BOX OF FROSTED FLAKES. LET'S GO." [ LAUGHTER ] NOT WHITE PEOPLE. "OOH, A TIGER! HERE, KITTY, KITTY, KITTY. I FUCKING LOVE TIGERS." THEY SAID THE TIGER ESCAPED 'CAUSE THE TIGER ENCLOSURE WAS BUILT FOUR FEET TOO SHORT. BLACK PEOPLE AIN'T GOT TO BE GOOD AT MATH TO KNOW THAT FENCE LOOK SHORT THAN A MOTHERFUCKER, DON'T IT? "HE CAN GET OUT. I'M GETTING IN THE CAR. FUCK THAT SHIT." AND THE CHIEF OF POLICE GOT ON TV AND SAID THE THREE VICTIMS OF THE TIGER ATTACK HAD A CRIMINAL RECORD. WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT GOT TO DO WITH A TIGER? LIKE THE TIGER WENT, "WELL, THEY HAD STRIPES AND I HAD STRIPES." LOT OF SHIT IS DIFFERENT, MAN. LAST YEAR IN UTAH, 11 COAL MINERS TRAPPED IN A COAL MINE. WE USED THE MOST MODERN EQUIPMENT KNOWN TO MAN AND WE WERE UNABLE TO RESCUE THEM. BUT A MONTH AND HALF LATER, I SHIT YOU NOT, 3,500 BLACK GOLD MINERS WERE TRAPPED IN A GOLD MINE IN JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA, AND THE NEXT DAY, EVERY ONE OF THEM BROTHERS GOT OUT. 'CAUSE BLACK PEOPLE AIN'T WAITING FOR HELP. FUCK Y'ALL. "SHOULD WE WAIT?" "THIS IS AFRICA. THEY WILL NEVER COME! DIG, UBUNTU, DIG." [ LAUGHTER ] BLACK PEOPLE WAS POPPING UP IN CHINA. "OH, THANK GOD. SOMEONE CALL ANGELINA JOLIE. I NEED TO BE ADOPTED. THIS IS BULLSHIT." [ LAUGHTER ] WHITE FOLK ALWAYS GETTING SHOT AT WORK. THAT'S VERY UNNECESSARY. IF YOU'RE EVER UNCERTAIN WHAT TO DO, ALWAYS WATCH THE BLACK PEOPLE. WHEN WE LEAVE, JUST GET UP AND COME WITH US. 'CAUSE BLACK PEOPLE GOT A WAY OF KNOWING WHEN DANGER'S AROUND. "THIS IS A CRAZY MOTHERFUCKER RIGHT HERE. THIS PLACE ABOUT TO BE ON THE NEWS. FUCK THIS SHIT." WHITE PEOPLE JUST WALK UP TO HIM. "WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE WITH THAT CAMOUFLAGE ON? I HAD NO IDEA --" PUH, PUH, PUH, PUH, PUH. WE AT HOME WATCHING THE NEWS. "I WAS JUST THERE. THEY DONE KILLED THE SUPERVISOR. I'M GONNA APPLY FOR THE JOB TOMORROW. FUCK THAT SHIT. HE AIN'T COMING BACK." SHIT IS SO DIFFERENT, MAN. THESE KIDS THESE DAYS GOT DISEASES I AIN'T NEVER EVEN FUCKING HEARD OF. "I'M BIPOLAR. THAT MEANS I HAVE TWO PERSONALITIES." YOU COULD HAVE NEVER TOLD OUR MOTHERS NO SHIT LIKE THAT. "MOM, I'M BIPOLAR. I GOT TWO PERSONALITIES." "WELL, BOTH YOU MOTHERFUCKERS GO IN THERE AND CLEAN THAT GODDAMN ROOM. AND IT BETTER NOT TAKE THAT LONG SINCE IT'S TWO OF YOU, GOD DAMN IT." "I'M SCHIZOPHRENIC. I HEAR VOICES." "THAT'S ME, MOTHERFUCKER. CLEAN THAT GODDAMN ROOM!" [ LAUGHTER ] THESE KIDS ARE FUCKING SOFT. LEAVE THEM IN THE CAR IN THE SUMMER AND THEY DIE. WHAT TYPE OF SHIT IS THAT? WE GOT LEFT IN THE CAR IN THE SUMMER AND WE DIDN'T DIE 'CAUSE WE HAD SENSE ENOUGH TO GET OUT OF THE FUCKING CAR. "IT'S HOT. WE IN THE CAR. WE GONNA DIE." "NOT ME. I'M GETTING OUT THE CAR." "MAMA SAID DON'T GET OUT." "WELL, I'LL TAKE THE WHUPPING, BUT I'M GETTING OUT OF THE FUCKING CAR. SHE CAN'T CATCH ME. I GOT TWO PERSONALITIES. FUCK THAT SHIT." KIDS GOT TO RIDE A BIKE WITH A HELMET ON. WE NEVER RODE NO BIKE WITH NO GODDAMN HELMET. IF YOU FELL AND HIT YOUR HEAD, YOU JUST HIT YOUR GODDAMN HEAD, STAGGER TO THE HOUSE WITH A LUMP ON YOUR HEAD. YOUR MOTHER GOT MAD AT YOU. "YOU DONE HIT YOUR GODDAMN HEAD! LAY DOWN AND TAKE A NAP! NOW I GOT TO WAKE YOU UP EVERY 20 MINUTES AND MAKE SURE YOU DON'T SLIDE INTO NO COMA. NOW LAY DOWN, THEN WAKE UP. LAY DOWN, THEN WAKE UP. THIS HOW IT'S GOING ALL NIGHT, YOU LITTLE FUCKER." [ LAUGHTER ] KIDS GOT BABY FOOD. WE AIN'T HAD NO FUCKING BABY FOOD. JUST THE SHIT YOUR MAMA CHEWED UP AND GAVE YOUR ASS. REMEMBER THAT? OPEN YOUR MOUTH. I DON'T WANT THIS PORK CHOP AFTER YOU DONE SUCKED ALL THE JUICE OUT OF IT. I'M TOO YOUNG FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. THIS IS SOME BULLSHIT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW HOW IT WAS. WHEN KIDS ARE TEETHING THESE DAYS, THEIR MOTHER AND FATHER GIVE THEM TEETHING RINGS AND ANBESOL. WHEN WE WAS GROWING UP AND YOU WAS TEETHING, YOUR MOTHER WOULD ACTUALLY RUB WHISKEY ON YOUR GUMS. REMEMBER THAT SHIT? "CAN YOU FEEL YOUR TEETH?" "I CAN'T EVEN FEEL MY FACE. THIS IS SOME BULLSHIT." 'CAUSE LIQUOR WAS THE ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING. REMEMBER THAT? YOU GOT A COLD, YOU GOT A HOT TODDY. THIS MUCH LIQUOR, THIS MUCH TEA. YOU DRIFT RIGHT THE FUCK OFF. "OH, MY GOD." BY THE TIME YOU WAKE UP, YOU AIN'T EVEN HAVE NO COLD NO MORE. "I FEEL BETTER, BUT IT'S CHRISTMAS AGAIN. JESUS CHRIST." YOU HAD TO GROW UP EARLY WHEN WE WAS GROWING UP 'CAUSE YOUR PARENTS WOULD SEND YOU TO THE STORE TO BUY SHIT YOU WAS TOO YOUNG TO BUY. REMEMBER THAT? "I WANT YOU TO GO TO THE STORE, GET ME A FIFTH OF GIN AND PACK OF CIGARETTES." "MAMA, I'M TWO. THEY AIN'T GONNA LET ME HAVE THAT SHIT." "HERE, TAKE THIS NOTE." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEY WOULD GIVE IT TO YOU. YOU WOULD BE A LITTLE BOY WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH LIQUOR AND CIGARETTES. AND YOUR NEIGHBORS WOULD BE GOING, "THAT'S A GOOD LITTLE BOY, RIGHT THERE. HOW COME YOU CAN'T BE LIKE HIM?" PARENTS ARE VERY PROTECTIVE OVER THEIR CHILDREN THESE DAYS. WHEN WE WAS GROWING UP, OUR PARENTS DIDN'T BELIEVE IN THAT SHIT. THEY BELIEVED EXPERIENCE WAS THE BEST TEACHER, AND THAT WAS IT. REMEMBER THAT? LIKE, "I DONE TOLD YOUR LITTLE ASS THAT STOVE WAS HOT, BUT YOU DON'T BELIEVE NO-GODDAMN-BODY. SO GO AHEAD. TOUCH IT. TOUCH IT!" THAT'S WHY ALL BLACK PEOPLE GOT A BURN MARK ON THEIR ARM OR THEIR LEG OR THEIR FUCKING FOOT. BLACK PEOPLE LEARN HOW TO SAY "HOT" BEFORE WE LEARN HOW TO SAY "MOMMY" AND "DADDY." "HOT, HOT! HOT, HOT, HOT! HOT! HOT!" "OOH, THE BABY TALKING SO GOOD NOW." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU CAN'T TALK TO CHILDREN LIKE WE GOT TALKED TO. LAST YEAR, ALEC BALDWIN GOT IN TROUBLE 'CAUSE HE CALLED HIS 11-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER A PIG. PEOPLE GOT UPSET. "I CAN'T BELIEVE AN ADULT WOULD TALK TO A CHILD LIKE THAT." ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY? REMEMBER THE WAY OUR PARENTS USED TO TALK -- "IF YOU DON'T SIT DOWN AND SHUT THE FUCK UP, I WILL BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF YOU, YOU IGNORANT SON OF A BITCH. GOT ME CUSSING. NO, I'M A CHRISTIAN, TOO. YOU COST ME A TRIP TO HEAVEN, I WILL FUCK YOU UP! I SWEAR TO GOD." [ LAUGHTER ] MY MOTHER USED TO PRAY AND CUSS. "PLEASE, JESUS, DON'T LET ME RAISE UP AND CHOKE THE FUCK OUT OF THIS LITTLE MOTHER FUCKER. STRIKE HIM DEAD, JESUS. PLEASE. HIM AND HIS DADDY BOTH. YOU CAN GET A TWO-FOR-ONE. FUCK THEM BOTH. AMEN, JESUS." I WAS WATCHING CNN A LITTLE WHILE BACK, SAW A 9-YEAR-OLD BOY CALL THE POLICE ON HIS MOTHER FROM THE CELLPHONE IN THE CAR 'CAUSE SHE WAS DRUNK DRIVING. "MY MOTHER'S DRIVING DRUNK AGAIN. SHE'S BEEN WARNED ABOUT THIS REPEATEDLY. SHE'S A DANGER TO SOCIETY." WE COULD HAVE NEVER MADE NO FUCKING CALL LIKE THAT. "HELLO -- WHA-HAHAHA. I GOT THE WRONG NUMBER." [ LAUGHTER ] "SHE DONE WHUPPED ME AND MY OTHER PERSONALITY. HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT." Y'ALL READY TO KEEP THIS THING GOING? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OUR FIRST ACT IS A TRUE LEGEND IN THE GAME. I'VE GROWN UP IN COMEDY WITH THIS DUDE. YOU WILL LOVE HIM AS MUCH AS I DO. PLEASE PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER FOR THE ONE AND ONLY ARNEZ J. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOW'S EVERYBODY DOING? AND I ALWAYS GIVE PRAISE TO THE MASTER, LORD JESUS. THAT'S RIGHT. I PRAISE HIS HOLY NAME. I HOPE THAT, UH -- THAT -- [ CHUCKLES ] MAN, WHOO, THAT'S BRIGHT. YES, SIR. THAT'S REALLY BRIGHT. AND YOU GONNA SIT NEXT TO HIM WITH THE ORANGE. SHAQ DIESEL! MAN, I TOOK A PICTURE WITH SHAQ. THAT WASN'T EVEN RIGHT. YEAH, I'M 5'7", AND HIS NUTS IS 5'7". YOU KNOW, THAT WAS SOME BULLCRAP. YOU KNOW HOW MEN ARGUING LIKE TO GET UP ON EACH OTHER. I BE RIGHT UP ON -- JUST RIGHT THERE WHERE HIS ZIPPER IS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, I HOPE THAT I'M WORTHY OF YOUR APPLAUSE. I'M GONNA START THE SHOW. I JUST GOT SOME THINGS ON MY MIND. [ SIGHS ] [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY. I'M JUST GONNA TAKE THIS OFF TO START. I JUST GOT TO SAY. NOW, ALL THE WHITE PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE, THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT. I'M GONNA LET YOU KNOW I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT YOU TONIGHT. I MEAN, I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT US TOO, BUT YOU FIRST. YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE FIRST AT EVERYTHING. THERE YOU GO. I DON'T KNOW. I LIKE TO TEASE WHITE PEOPLE. SOMETIMES JUST JUMP AT THEM LIKE THAT. 'CAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO REACT. "HEY, HEY, HEY! IS THAT REALLY NECESSARY?" AND IN MIAMI WE GOT LATINOS! HEY, QUé PASó? WATCH ALL THEM NIGGERS. THEY WILL TALK TO YOU SLOW, BUT THEY WILL STAB YOU QUICK. JUMP OUT AT ONE OF THEM. TCH! TCH! [ Hispanic accent ] "I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE PLAYING, HOMES." TCH! TCH! "I DID IT AGAIN JUST SO YOU KNOW I AM FOR REAL." [ Normal voice ] I MEAN, SPEAKING OF STABBING SOMEBODY -- I MEAN, DON'T GO STAB NOBODY 'CAUSE YOU EVER NOTICE, A WHITE PERSON GET STABBED, THE POLICE COME TOO QUICK. IT'S 'CAUSE -- IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE WHITE. IT'S BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW TO YELL GOOD. YOU STAB A WHITE PERSON. TCH! [ Dramatically ] "DEAR, GOD! I'VE BEEN STABBED, AND THERE'S BLOOD EVERYWHERE." [ Normal voice ] LATINOS, Y'ALL REACTION TIME TOO SLOW. Y'ALL -- TCH! [ Hispanic accent ] "AI-EEE. WHY YOU STAB ME IN MY HEART?" [ Normal voice ] AND, BLACK PEOPLE, I DON'T KNOW WHY Y'ALL LAUGHING. WE SO STUPID, WE REFUSE TO BELIEVE WE JUST GOT STABBED. WE GET STABBED, WE GOT TO ASK ANOTHER NIGGER IF WE GOT STABBED. TELL ME IF THIS DON'T SOUND FAMILIAR. "YEAH, DAWG. YOU KNOW HOW I ONCE --" TCH! "NIGGER, DID SOMEBODY JUST STAB ME, MAN?" [ LAUGHTER ] I GOT TO TO TELL YOU THIS 'CAUSE GOD TOLD ME TO CONFESS ON MY SOUL 'CAUSE I DID SOMETHING KIND OF FOUL. I WENT TO A CHURCH LAST MONTH CALLED EBENEZER BAPTIST. NOW, I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A CHURCH CALLED EBENEZER BAPTIST. ALSO, I'VE NEVER SEEN A PERSON IN A WHEELCHAIR BE BAPTIZED. I'M ONLY REPORTING WHAT I SAW, OKAY? [ LAUGHTER ] AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE GONNA PICK THE DUDE UP OUT THE WHEELCHAIR AND PUT HIM IN -- DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH. COME ON. ...AND PUT HIM IN THE POOL. NO. THEY TOOK THE WHOLE WHEELCHAIR AND ROLLED IT IN THE POOL. I'M LIKE, "OH, MY GOD. HIS WHEELS GONNA RUST." THAT'S THE ONLY THING I WAS THINKING ABOUT. AND THEN I THOUGHT THEY WERE GONNA PINCH HIS NOSE AND TIP HIM BACK A LITTLE BIT. [ Laughing ] NO. THEY HAD A DUDE STANDING BY HIS WHEEL. THE DIDN'T EVEN GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO BREATHE. THE PASTOR SAID, "I NOW BAPTIZE YOU." AND HE WANTED TO CHANGE HIS MIND. HE SAID, "WAIT A MINUTE." DUDE WAS LIKE, "UH-UH." AND YOU COULD TELL HE WAS DROWNING 'CAUSE HIS LITTLE FEET WAS DANGLING LIKE THIS. AND I SAID SOMETHING IN CHURCH I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY. I STOOD UP, I SAID, "SOMEBODY HELP THAT NIGGER!" I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY "NIGGER" IN CHURCH. I DIDN'T. AND YOU KNEW HE WAS DROWNING, 'CAUSE WHEN THE PASTOR AND THEM, THEY PULLED HIM UP HE'S LIKE, "[GASPS] MOTHERFUCKER!" AND THE PASTOR SAID, "DIP HIM AGAIN... 'CAUSE HE'S STILL GOT SOME SHIT IN HIM." I WAS LIKE, "SHIT! OH, MY GOD. THIS IS SOME BULLSHIT." THEN THE CHOIR STARTED GOING, ♪ BULLSHIT! I'M JUST LETTING YOU KNOW IT WAS A CURSED SUNDAY. THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING. OKAY, OKAY. CALM DOWN. COUPLE MORE THINGS, THEN I'M GONNA START THE SHOW. THIS IS A TRUE STORY. I GOT TO TELL YOU THIS. Y'ALL KNOW I'M A STORYTELLER, SO LISTEN. I WAS A FLIGHT ATTENDANT FOR SIX YEARS. WHOO! WHAT? OH, NOW I DON'T LOOK LIKE A FLIGHT ATTENDANT? WHATEVER. LOOK HERE. I WAS A FLIGHT ATTENDANT FOR SIX YEARS, AND I FLEW AN AIRLINE CALLED -- I AIN'T GONNA TELL YOU THE NAME OF THE AIRLINE -- BUT I FLEW AN AIRPLANE CALLED THE A300 AIRBUS, WHICH SEATS 272 PASSENGERS. I HAD A CREW OF EIGHT. I'M THE ONLY BLACK FLIGHT ATTENDANT ON THERE, AND I'M THE LEAD FLIGHT ATTENDANT. SOMEBODY DIDN'T READ MY RéSUMé RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW HOW I GOT THAT JOB. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I TOOK IT ANYWAY 'CAUSE I DID MY JOB. NOW, WHITE PEOPLE, Y'ALL ARE GONNA HAVE TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE. IF WE ARE AT 35,000 FEET UP IN AIR AND THERE'S AN EMERGENCY, DON'T YOU LOOK FOR A BLACK PERSON TO COME AND SAVE YOU. WE AIN'T USED TO BEING UP THAT HIGH. WE THERE FOR THE MONEY. WE AIN'T THERE TO SAVE YOUR ASS. IF YOU DROWNING IN THE OCEAN, DON'T YOU LOOK FOR ME TO COME AND SAVE YOU. NOW, WHAT YOU CAN DO IS YELL TO ME WHO YOU WANT ME TO CALL. AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL GET THERE BEFORE YOU GO, "BLUP-BLUP-BLUP BLUP." SO, LET ME TELL YOU THIS STORY. WE HAD AN EMER-- THIS IS A TRUE STORY. WE HAD AN EMERGENCY ON THE PLANE. WE WERE COMING FROM NEWARK, NEW JERSEY, LANDED IN DENVER, COLORADO. WE H-- GO AHEAD. YOU CAN CLAP. YEAH, YEAH. DENVER. HEY, WHATEVER. SO, ANYWAY, WE ON THE FLIGHT, AND YOU KNEW IT WAS SERIOUS. THE AIRLINE CAPTAIN GETS ON THE INTERCOM, "MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE? MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION? I NEED ALL FLIGHT ATTENDANTS." WHEN HE SAID "ALL FLIGHT ATTENDANTS," I PUT MY NIGGER EAR ON. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, HE SAID, "I NEED --" OKAY. OKAY. IT WAS FUNNY NOW, BUT IT WASN'T FUNNY WHEN IT HAPPENED. HE SAID, "I NEED ALL FLIGHT ATTENDANTS TO COME TO THE FORE GALLEY." NOW, WHEN WE CAME TO THE FORE GALLEY, THIS IS WHEN YOU KNEW IT GOT SERIOUS. "OKAY, I NEED ALL YOU FLIGHT ATTENDANTS IN THE COCKPIT RIGHT NOW SO I CAN BRIEF YOU AS TO WHAT'S GOING ON." NOW, I'M THE LEAD FLIGHT ATTENDANT. I'M NUMERO UNO, SO I'M GONNA LET ALL THE LITTLE OTHER WHITE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS GO BEFORE ME. I GET READY TO WALK IN THE COCKPIT, HE GO AND PUT HIS HANDS RIGHT HERE. I WAS LIKE, "HOLD UP, PLAYER. DON'T PUT YOUR HANDS ON ME." HE'S LIKE, "WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?" I SAID, "WH-WH-WH-WHAT THE FUCK WRONG WITH YOU?" SEE, WHEN BLACK PEOPLE GET SCARED, WE CURSE FOR NO REASON. SO I SAID, "YOU -- YOU -- YOU SAID, 'ALL FLIGHT ATTENDANTS.' WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?" HE SAID, "ARNEZ, I'M NOT GONNA HAVE THIS INSUBORDINATION." I SAID, "I DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION. I'M JUST TRYING TO TELL YOU WE GOT A PROBLEM." HE SAID, "YOU'RE GONNA BE FIRED." "WELL, LAND THE PLANE, BITCH. NO PROBLEM." OH, YEAH. THIS IS GONNA GET WORSE. SO NOW WE GOT AN EMERGENCY. I WASN'T LEAVING. I STOOD AT THE COCKPIT DOOR 'CAUSE I WASN'T GOING NOWHERE TILL SOMEBODY CAME OUT AND TOLD ME WHAT'S GOING ON. MEANWHILE, ALL THE PASSENGERS LOOKING IN THE AISLE LIKE THIS. SO I GRABBED THE INTERCOM. "WHAT? I DON'T KNOW SHIT. DON'T ASK ME NOTHING." SO NOW A LITTLE FLIGHT ATTENDANT COMES OUT OF THE COCKPIT WITH HER EYES LOOKING LIKE A DEER CAUGHT IN THE HEADLIGHT. DON'T LET A BLACK PERSON SEE YOU LOOKING LIKE THAT. NOW WE GONNA GET FIDGETY. I'M LIKE, "WHAT'S HAPPENING? WHAT'D THE CAPTAIN SAY? WHAT'D HE SAY?" SHE SAID, "ARNEZ, CALM DOWN." I SAID, "BITCH." I SAID, "I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO CALL YOU A BITCH. YOU MY CO-WORKER. HEIFER, YOU GONNA TELL ME SOMETHING." I SAID, "JUST -- JUST TELL ME. OOH, I CAN'T BREATHE! I CAN'T BREATHE! WHY'S MY SKIN ITCHY?" SHE SAID, "OKAY, ARNEZ. I'LL TELL YOU. WE JUST GOT WORD THAT THERE IS A BOMB." "AAH! NO! I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE CALLED IN SICK. I DON'T EVEN LIKE FLYING WITH YOU WHITE PEOPLE. I SWEAR TO GOD." OH, HOLD ON. THIS IS GONNA GET WORSE. NOW WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY ON THE PLANE, 35,000 FEET UP IN THE AIR. THEY SAY, "IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY, A FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE LAST ONE OFF THE PLANE." "NIGGER, WHO? NOT THIS NIGGER HERE." [ LAUGHTER ] SO, I STARTED LOOKING THROUGH THE MANUAL. I SAID, "SHOW ME WHERE IT SAYS, 'ARNEZ J IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE LAST ONE OFF THE PLANE'" THEY SAID, "WELL, IT DOESN'T SAY 'ARNEZ.'" I SAID, "WELL, UNTIL IT DOES, NIGGER, 'F' YOU." NOW WE'VE LANDED THE PLANE AT DENVER, COLORADO. AIRPORT RIGHT HERE. WHY THE CAPTAIN WANT TO TAKE THE PLANE OVER HERE IN A FIELD BY OURSELVES? SO WE CAN BLOW UP BY OURSELVES. NOW THEY DONE LET DOWN THE AIR SLIDES. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S SUPPOSED TO SAY, "THESE EXITS ARE BLOCKED. COME THIS WAY AND EXIT." OKAY. I'M THE LEAD FLIGHT ATTENDANT. I'M SUPPOSED TO BE AT THE FRONT DOOR. THE CAPTAIN SAYS, "ARNEZ, I NEED YOU IN THE MIDDLE." I'M LIKE, "WHY?" 'CAUSE HE KNEW IF I'D HAVE WENT TO THAT FRONT DOOR, I WOULD HAVE TRIPPED MYSELF ON PURPOSE. SO NOW I'M SCARED. I'M TRYING TO GET EVERYBODY OFF. NOW I'M GONNA CURSE 'CAUSE I'M NERVOUS. I WAS LIKE, "COME ONE! MOVE! LEAVE YOUR SHIT! I SWEAR TO GOD I'LL BEAT YOUR ASS. COME ON. GET UP. LITTLE MOTHERFUCKER, GET YOUR ASS UP. I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOUR MAMA AT. YEAH, I DO. SHE OUTSIDE." NOW THIS OLD LADY DECIDES SHE WANT TO TAKE HER WALKER DOWN FROM THE OVERHEAD IN FRONT OF ME. AND I'M BEHIND. "OH, MY GOD. COME ON. I CAN'T TAKE THIS. MOVE! NOW, YOU DONE LIVED YOUR LIFE. LET ME LIVE MINE. GET UP! GET UP! AIN'T NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU. GET UP!" SHE WAS 80. I'M 22. I DESERVED TO LIVE. AND THEN THEY GONNA FIRE ME. I GO INTO THE OFFICE THE NEXT DAY. "ARNEZ, DID YOU REALLY KNOCK AN OLD LADY DOWN DURING AN EMERGENCY EVACUATION?" I SAID, "WHO SAID THAT?" SUPERVISOR OPENED THE DOOR. GUESS WHO'S WALKING IN. I SAID, "I QUIT. SEND ME MY CHECK IN THE MAIL." OKAY. Y'ALL KNOW FAMILIES ARE VERY IMPORTANT. WE GOT TO LOVE OUR FAMILIES BECAUSE -- WHAT? WHAT? Y'ALL KNOW -- Y'ALL KNOW I HAVE A BROTHER THAT'S HANDICAPPED. I DON'T CARE. I'LL TALK ABOUT ANYBODY. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. AND DON'T YOU DARE FEEL SORRY FOR HIM. DON'T YOU DARE. MY BROTHER IS THE MEANEST HANDICAP THAT GOD HAS EVER CREATED. AND HE LOOKS LIKE THIS EVERY DAY. AND HE'LL JUST SIT IN THE FRONT YARD LOOKING AT CARS ALL DAY LONG. "MM-EN-EM-EN-EM. AAAH!" HE SCREAMED AT ME LIKE THAT ONE TIME. I WAS LIKE, "MAN, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?" "KCHHH. HA-HA! MO'BUCKA!" THAT'S HIS FAVORITE WORD. MO'BUCKA! OKAY. I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW. BUCKLE UP. BUCKLE UP. I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU THIS STORY ABOUT RODNEY. ONE DAY I CAME HOME, AND RODNEY WAS WAITING ON ME IN THE LIVING ROOM. I DON'T KNOW WHY HE WAS ALWAYS WAITING ON ME. YOU KNOW, THE CARPORTS WHERE YOU COULD PULL UP AND SEE THAT BIG, OLD PICTURE-FRAME WINDOW? HE IN THE WINDOW LIKE THIS. AND I'M LIKE, "DAMN! WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM TODAY?" AND I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO THE FRONT DOOR 'CAUSE HE JUST DISAPPEARED OUT THE WINDOW, RIGHT? SO I GO TO THE FRONT DOOR. I OPEN THE DOOR. HE WAS RIGHT THERE. "AAAH!" I'M LIKE, "WHAT'S WRONG? WHAT'S WRONG?" "KCHHH. EE, EE, EE, ME HUNGRY." I SAID, "WHY DON'T YOU GO ASK MAMA TO GET YOU SOMETHING TO EAT?" "MAN, WHAT THE MO'BUCKA MAMA GET NOTHING EAT. MO'BUCKA, YOU GONNA SOMETHING TO EAT, MO'BUCKAAA." [ LAUGHTER ] SO I SAID, "OKAY. CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN. I'LL GET YOU SOMETHING TO EAT." I SAID, "YOU WANT SOME McDONALD'S?" "KCHHH! NOOO! ME WANT BURGER KING." SO I TOOK HIM TO BURGER KING. NOW, I THOUGHT BECAUSE HE WAS HANDICAPPED, I COULD PARK IN THE HANDICAPPED PARKING LANE. THAT WASN'T TRUE. I GET OUT WALKING ALL NORMAL. THIS DUDE BLOCKED MY CAR IN SO I COULDN'T GO ANYWHERE. I SWEAR TO GOD, HE ROLLED DOWN THE WINDOW, HIS HEAD WAS ABOUT THIS BIG. HE STARTED LOOKING AT ME. I SAID, "WOW! I THINK I GOT HIS SPOT." MY BROTHER RODNEY, "MM-HMM." SO THEN HE STARTED TALKING. "HEY, YOU NOT SUPPOSED TO BE PARKING RIGHT THERE." I'M LIKE, "MAN, WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?" "TALKING TO YOU!

YOU GOT A WHOLE DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF A FINE WOMAN WHEN YOU IN YOUR 40s. SEE, WHEN YOU YOUNG, A FINE WOMAN IS A CHICK WITH THE MEASUREMENTS OF 36-24-36, BUT WHEN YOU IN YOUR 40s, A FINE WOMAN IS A CHICK WITH THE MEASUREMENTS OF A FICA SCORE OF 750. YOU BE ALL AT THE CLUB, "LOOK AT THAT 100% FINANCIER. IF I CAN GET HER ASS, I CAN GET EVERYTHING FROM BEST BUY. THAT'S MY BOO RIGHT THERE. I LOVE THAT MOTHERFUCKER." I WOULDN'T GIVE A FUCK IF SHE GOT ONE EYE AND WALK WITH A LIMP. I'D BE WITH THAT MOTHERFUCKER. YOU CAN KEEP THEM DIME PIECES, THEM ARM CANDIES. THEM MOTHERFUCKERS AIN'T WORTH A QUARTER.

THAT'S WHY YOU WILL FIND ME ANYWHERE, 'CAUSE I AIN'T GOT NO WOMAN. I BE AT PLACES I DON'T NEED TO BE. SEE, I LIKE HIP-HOP, BUT I CAN'T BE AT NO HIP-HOP CLUB, NIGGER. YOU FUCK AROUND AND LOSE YOUR LIFE. THAT'S WHY A REAL BLACK MAN AIN'T AFRAID OF NO AL-QAEDA, NO TALIBAN 'CAUSE, NIGGER, WHEN WE GO OUT TO HANG AT CLUBS, NIGGER, WE PARTY WITH TERRORISTS EVERY WEEKEND. WE BE AT THE CLUB DANCING. "DAMN, BABY. YOU LOOKING GOOD AS SHIT. POW! POW! POW! THIS NIGGER SHOOTING AGAIN. I'M GONNA BUY YOU THAT DRINK SOON AS THE POLICE COME." AND AS YOU GET OLDER, NIGGER, YOU LOSE YOUR INSTINCTS.

"NIGGER, WHO YOU HOLLERING AT? THE BIBLE SAYS, 'COME AS YOU ARE.' I GOT TO PUT ON SOME SHOES TO DANCE WITH THEM DEVILS?" AND I DON'T LIKE FUCKING WITH ALL THE CLUBS ANYWAY 'CAUSE YOU GOT TO COMPETE AGAINST YOUR DADDY. AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THESE OLD PLAYERS ARE COMING FROM, BUT THEM NIGGERS ARE COMPETITION. YOU EVER HEAR AN OLD MAN TALK TO A WOMAN, YOU HEAR SHIT YOU AIN'T HEARD SINCE "ROOTS." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT NIGGER THROW YOUR GAME ALL OFF. THAT NIGGER COME IN THE CLUB, "OOH, LORDY, LORDY, LORDY. LOOK AT THE SKEEZERS IN THE HOUSE." "DID THIS NIGGER SAY 'SKEEZER'?" "I KNOW DADDY GONNA FIND HIM SOME COOTIE CAT." "COOTIE CAT?" NIGGER BE ANSWERING THE PHONE. "SOMEBODY PAGED ME FROM THIS NUMBER." "PAGED YOU?" NIGGER, I CAN'T BE IN THE CLUB, NIGGER, LOOKING FOR PAGERS GETTING COOTIE CAT. BUT I LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT OLDER MEN. THEY FUCK WITH YOUNGER WOMEN. YOUNGER WOMEN FUCK WITH OLDER MEN. THEY CALL THEM SUGAR DADDIES. SEE, BACK IN THE DAY, YOUNGER WOMEN, BOY, THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO SLEEP WITH POPS IF THEY WANT THAT MONEY. JUST GO OVER TO HIS HOUSE LATE AT NIGHT, RUB HIM ON THE KNEE, PLAY WITH THE BALLS, TAKE THE MONEY, AND LEAVE. CAN'T DO THAT TO POPS NOW. POPS GOT STRENGTH. POPS LIKE POPEYE.
