-Official. -Yes ma'am? Where is the divorce trial of that good man? -The Marquis trial? -Yes. -Cut number two. -Thank you, officer. I'm open-minded, but I was shocked. I'm not usually interested in divorces, but this one. This is the case of the Marquis. In my entire career I have never seen a man who does not deserve anything. But I tell you, there is a man in this court today who is ruthless and insensitive. Unmoved by the pain it has caused. Kenneth Marquis presumably sits here gloating. A poor and loyal woman suffers. A girl. A girl who is still too young inocent and naive. Kenneth Marquis treated you like trash, Your Honor. And from the moment they got married, even on their wedding night, he insulted and hurt her. Even the night he was a fifteen meter schooner and a pearl necklace. Not to mention a blonde, silvery blue and colored mink , covering her furry little heart. I start to hate that lawyer more than that poisonous woman. Something happened? That worm didn't come out to tell me what's wrong. -I hope it works. -I also. Hurry up Not even your mother would recognize you. If he sees us together he will know who you are. Take off your glasses, Corliss. Your father said no and it will be. One of the positively humiliating things is that they broadcast the trial or put it on television. They do that with the President's speech or there is a baseball game. After all, Kenneth Marquis romances they are more interesting than a baseball game. "Won't you wait for Dexter?" -I think. Three wives seem like too many. Maybe not if you have one at a time. -Corliss. -Don't try to play with me. I've waited two hours for you to tell me what happened. Well Marquis has been on the stand since the last time I went out. -He's quite a character. "Did you mention the other wives?" He only refers to them by number. -The one must be a fool. -The New York dancer. He said he was so mad at her that he married both of them. And that he made such a mistake that he did not know what he was doing when the three appeared. She is also a fool. I wish I was as confused as he is. He knew what he was doing. Dexter, I put you in to listen not to get ideas. Seeing them, how not to get ideas? Well, don't see anymore, just listen. I want you to do a full report on everything he says. Good grief, I was enjoying myself , not preparing for an exam. Dexter Franklin, go back there and this time take notes. Kenneth Marquis is a moral leper. Think of that girl, the wife who loved him. What if it had been his daughter? Suppose your daughter, or mine, heard your sweetening words and falls in love and marries him only to be discarded later by this traitor. Your Honor, Kenneth Marquis took this girl to be his wife, now that he's tired of playing with her, wants to get rid of it. I tell you that you must learn a lesson. He must learn that a decent man the union of marriage is not taken lightly . Let us know if this beard will destroy the life of an innocent girl again If it cost you a million dollars Mother, listen to this, it 's on the cover. "Marquis's third wife makes two hundred thousand dollars. Local lawyers win the victory. Harry P. Archer said today Than Kenneth Marquis's wife's money it was a justification of honor and honesty. Participation was the main thing in this case, not the money, "Archer continued. Sure, money is important too. -Sure. - Speaking of money, mommy. Mildred and I want to go to the movies today. I know I have little money but I need $ 1.50. There is no money. It is a main question for me as well. Â¡Corliss! Other than that, Burt Lancaster will be in today's movie. Mommy, I must go. Why don't you tell Dexter? Because otherwise he 'll think I'm not mad at him. Angry, dear, not angry. And why are you? I'm not. You are saving for a repair and I will not spend it for the movies, unless you think i'm mad and tried to make up for it by asking me out. Besides, I want to see the poor fool suffer . Honestly, Corliss, It's time for you to stop acting like a girl you're seventeen, you're too old for those jokes. Corliss. Why didn't you answer me? Jeez, Corliss, just tell me. What did I do? What did I do? If you don't know, there is no point in discussing it. But ... what is ...? Good grief, how can women be so unreasonable? So now am I unreasonable? I didn't mean it like that. Instead of apologizing you accuse me of being unreasonable. Okay, I apologize. I'm sorry. And yes you must feel it. I still think it wasn't that terrible. -Seriously? Interesting. -I know why you are so resentful. Well, I did buy Betty Campbell a soda . I ran into her in Stroders and a boy must be polite. My dear, I assure you that your infatuation for that curly blonde It is my total and complete indifference. -Now, please go. -Jesus Corliss ... And if you beg me to take me to the movies today I'm not interested. I already have other plans. Shut up. -Hi, Miss Hibbs. -Hi, Corliss. Are you daddy? He's busy, there's someone with him. I can't wait, I'm in a rush. Corliss, it can't happen. Daddy, sorry, but something important came along ... Corliss, you can't come in like this when I'm busy. I'm Kenneth Marquis, part of the second part. Hi, I'm Corliss Archer. Daddy is my father. Your father? This is Mr. Taylor. How are you. Wait outside, Corliss. But, daddy angel ... Don't call me "daddy angel." -Daddy, I need $ 1.50. -I told you to wait outside. More than witnessing their valuable behavior, I'd be more than happy to donate the money myself. That's very nice of you. Don't take that money! His father's lack of grace stems in part from a tendency to be suffocated and an unnatural resignation to part with your money. -Kenneth, watch out. -He doesn't know daddy at all. -Don't talk to that man! -Daddy, compared to my $ 1.50 ... Archer, let's get back to business. I'll talk to you outside. Now alone! If I was in your position I would be completely disappointed. It has been a great pleasure meeting you, Mr. Marquis. And if the humiliation of asking your daddy for money it gets too big to resist, do not hesitate to call me. Stop messing with Archer or we'll get to nothing. You know? I am seriously considering dedicating myself for life a entrometerme con Harry P. Archer. Nothing satisfies me more. Sure, Archer, we can appeal the verdict, But wouldn't an out-of-court settlement be better ? I wouldn't do that for less than two hundred thousand dollars. Well seeing that you are a man without previous mental capacity , I'll go now so I can silently contemplate and in peace the horrible accidents that can happen to me. Good day. Don't move your hand. -Wait a minute. -Hi there. Nice colour. I can't do it with the left. Since you take this tap by mail course -You've become unbearable. -Well at least that's how you talk to me. I guess I have to because of your mental condition. Schizophrenia. Double personality. Although since he cannot count, I do not know. What's wrong with my personality? The way you act says so. Half unreasonable, half childish. We saw a movie about it last night. You should see it. It will help you realize what an idiot you are. I also like you. Richard Widmark suffered the same, but Humphrey Bogard suffered from amnesia, -he forgot everything for ten years. -I would like to suffer from amnesia. -I would like to forget her. -Surely yes. -Hello, Mr. Archer. -Janet. -Hello Daddy. -Hi, Mildred. Is your mother home, Corliss? -Hello, Mr. Archer. -Dexter, I want to talk to you. Well, I'm glad someone wants. All right, Mr. Archer, tell me. Did you tell your parents where you were last night? -They didn't ask me. -Do you know where I was? No, but you don't have to tell me if you don't want to. -I was at the Penguin Club. -What was he doing in a place like that? Well, I was there for the committee ... -It doesn't matter, what were you doing there? -Who? I? If you! Did you really go to a gambling club ? How do you know? It's supposed to be a restaurant. -Everyone knows it's a club. - Those of the committee no. Mr. Archer, I was just taking a look. It was funny? So you went consciously to gamble ? At the! Jimmy Philips parks cars there. He helped me get in because I wanted to see the place. -How much did you earn? -I had an extra room. The citizens committee is closing the place. And what about the girl you were with? A girl? Is it an appropriate place to take a girl? Who was? Never mind, it sure was that curly blonde. Jeez, Corliss ... Why, insignificant worm? I don't want to talk to you again for the rest of my life. Me neither. God, Mr. Archer, why did you have to tell him? Because I think I should have known. If you can't take a girl other than the Penguin Club, I don't want you to go out with my daughter. Please can't do this to me. And if you have a gentleman's instinct , You will return that photo of me that I gave you in a bathing suit. Do not say anything. Just one, just one in my own home. I would like to have a newspaper to read. If you're looking for comic strips, Corliss has them. Hey, I didn't come to spend the night To hear you complain about Dexter. I've started to think that one day I will forget how crazy I am for him today. I will always be willing to remind you. Yes, but what if you are not there? Just thinking that I'm not crazy about him infuriates me. Corliss, where is the rest of the newspaper? Go to bed. And what are you doing now? I will write in my journal what I think of Dexter and so I will not forget. -How do you spell "baboon"? -I don't know, draw it. -Sure, come in. -Here are your things. I packed them up and forgot them. Thanks, Raymond. Toothbrush, nightgown, peanuts, novel. -Will you stay here for a month? -Go away. Don't worry, I think the newspapers are stupid. -You think everything is silly. -And I'm right. Hey, don't you want me to cover it with fur? For the dollars. A girl would be crazy to let you touch her diary. Just to show you that I trust you, I'll let you cover it. -For fifty more cents. -I'll pay you when you return it. But, Raymond, I trust you. There are things in this journal that no one should know. -It would be terrible ... -Corliss! I don't know if you lost your mind But even my mother wouldn't trust this imp. I do. I will return your honor. Pick it up tomorrow. I want to finish what I was writing. -Don't forget, $ 2.50. -You said two dollars. Right, two bucks, I just wanted to see if you listened. Get out of here. Okay, I'm stupid, I don't understand. I wanted Raymond to read it, because then he'll tell Dexter to read it. Wouldn't it be easier to give it to Dexter? Don't be naive, that would be too obvious. And Dexter wouldn't believe everything I write for his benefit. God, what I'd give to see her face. Knowing my repulsive brother I bet he'll charge Dexter just for reading it. But what am I going to write? Mildred, you have to help me. Seriously, what a boring life I have. Look at this: "Today we had spaghetti and meatballs for dinner ." Is that a romantic thing for a diary What's supposed to make Dexter crackle? -Come on, suggest me something. -Corliss, this came for you. Thanks, Louise. -God, this is great. -I wonder what it is. I don't know, there is a beautiful box. That must have all the Mississippi candy . I wonder who touched. Cute. Who sends? Uncle George? -Rico. -Â¡Kenneth Marquis! Let me see. "May this enlighten a maddened young woman for parental stupidity and greed ", Kenneth Marquis. He did this to annoy me. I'm going to throw it away. -Daddy, please! -What happens? That degenerate jerk Casanova de Marquis He sent Corliss this box of candy. Daddy says I can't keep it. But why didn't Harry ...? Did Kenneth Marquis send candy to Corliss? -You see, mother ... -Corliss has nothing to do with it. Try to upset me by showing I'm a miser. So if Corliss has nothing to do with Mr. Marquis, I don't think it's affected by her keeping the candy. Look Mom. Anyway, you can't return them if one is missing. Daddy ate it. Anyway, I don't care about candy ... It's late. They should already go to sleep. Watch your hips, Mom. Good night, go to bed, girls. - It must have cost a fortune. -More than a repair. I can't imagine receiving such a gift from Kenneth Marquis. - Isn't it magnificent? -Of course. I've seen it several times in my daddy's office. It was on business. He never sent me more than a candy bar. Ken is really cute, even though we only met once. There was a spark between us. Later, I told Dexter that ... Â¡Dexter, Kenneth Marquis! It would be perfect if she wrote about him in the journal. -Dexter is going to turn green. -Let's start working. I do this page and you the next. Who first? Let me think. Kenneth Marquis, what a beautiful name. And it's so different from what I expected He's kind, caring, considerate ... ...and lovely. I can see that he has been terribly hurt for all the women in his life. But I know that I can make him love again. He told me what he needs is the love of a good woman then he looked into my eyes and looked deeply into my soul. -Do you think it's too cheesy? -Not for Dexter. He's a worldly boy. I think it sounds perfect. Now you. He took me in his arms and kissed me. It was so delicate that I hardly felt his lips against mine. Kenneth, I love you so much. How can I heal the wounds that are horrible ...? Horrifying what, Corliss? Well I'll just put a few exclamation marks and have him figure it out. Outside, I have enough problems without you. -Don't you dare hit her. -Just relax. If daddy finds out you were here, he kills you. You won't know. Your parents and mine went to Wicox's. I'm supposed to sleep at Herb Brown's house. I don't know why all this still sucks. I never bet anything. For heaven's sake, a man must learn from life. If you wanted to know the place, you should have waited for me to go with you. -Your dad wouldn't have left you. -Anyway I don't care. If I wanted to go, I could go. Nobody said they couldn't. Besides, no one would have known. -Wait, if you suggest that ... -I am not implying anything. I'm not even sure I went with you after how you acted. Even if you had knelt to ask me. You are crazy, I will not kneel. If your father finds out He wouldn't let me go back for twenty years. I think that a person who wants to be well with someone would not shy away from what that person might suggest, possibly in a remote, hypothetical and random case. -You mean luck. -I meant you're yellow. Corliss, anything but that. I would skin myself alive, just like you. Go away, I'm not interested. Fine, if you want to be unreasonable. You can be a fool if you want, but I can't. I can't take you there even if you get mad at me. We are not going to that place and you owe me to thank me. Thank you. Hell, I don't know how women can be dumb. You are lucky I have willpower. Get mad all you want, I 'm not taking you to the Penguin Club. It's great when you're not mad at me. I'm not mad at you at all. Let's go. Jimmy left it open. Where we go? That door leads to the betting room . When we walk in we'll walk around like it doesn't matter. As if you were bored. So. -What is that? -There must be a fire. -Cops, they invaded the place! -Daddy said he was going to close it. -Dexter! -What are we going to do? If they know we're here and they catch us in a raid ... That won't help. -Open, it's the Police! -Come on, we can't stay. -Where we go? -There. Here. I'm scared. Hold on until the raid is over and we can go. Wilcox is an idiot. Said to be a good player, bet three dollars and wanted to play deuces wild. And he won, right? I'll go upstairs to see if Corliss is home. The logic of a woman. That he won and I asked for three miserable dollars it does not mean that he is a good player. Â¡Harry, Harry! Â¡Louise! Corliss is not in his room. -Have you checked the bathroom? -Of course I checked. His bed is not even made . Â¡Louise! What happens? Louise, do you have any idea where Corliss is? -He's not in his room. -I fell asleep early. He was on the back stairs . -He's not in his room. -I was right behind. -Corliss. -Did someone call? Did someone come to see her? Said something? -Where could he be? -Not here. -What could have happened? -Louise, did you look good? Answer me! That's enough! There is no point in getting nervous. -Go back to bed, Louise. -I want to help. I'll let you know as soon as we know something. We'll let you know as soon as Corliss returns. I can't stand people who don't keep calm In an emergency. I no longer listen to them. Can we go now? I'll look. I think they are gone. Wait a minute. -It does not open. -Do something. We must get out of here. Ask for help. Help! Help! Help! Help! -You got hurt? -No. Well, as long as we are here we can live and be thin. Thank you, I really appreciate it. Goodnight. Dexter stayed at a boy's house . Martin Wilcox is home and so is Mildred. Well, maybe she dated a new guy. What could she be doing with a boy at this hour? Corliss hangs out with guys all the time -and something had never happened. -He always comes back at twelve. What could you do after twelve that you can't do before? Might... Does not matter. I remember before we got married You didn't take me home until almost three. That was different. Corliss is still a child. This is caviar, at least we won't be hungry. - Tastes fishy. -It's fish, fish roe. I like it best when it is an adult fish. Maybe we'll be here until those eggs hatch. Dexter, what are we going to do? It's like being stranded on a desert island. -At least we're together. -That won't please my parents. I bet they'll go crazy. God, it doesn't matter if I get out of here or not. When your father finds out, he will kill us. So is. Police department? This is Harry P. Archer of 1214 sycamore. Yes sir. My daughter Corliss is missing. How will I know where it is? If I knew, I wouldn't call him. Early in the afternoon. She is seventeen. It doesn't weigh much ... Hair? His hair is more or less ... Harry! That's not a description, give me that. Hi there? Corliss is 1.59, hips 86 cm, birthday ... We want to find her, not buy her a dress. Yes, I do have photographs. She is a pretty girl. Yes, yes, I see. But when? The police are coming. Go to bed! Sorry louise I think I'm too upset for this. Go back to bed. Jeez that woman should be crying in the privacy of your room. Harry, I'm sure Corliss, wherever he is, it is against their will. Maybe she was kidnapped. Maybe the car broke down ... But he should have walked to a phone by now. I think of all the times I yelled at him. I wanted to wear earrings. And I told him he was too young. We have treated her like a baby. Although, in fact, she is no longer a baby. Harry, she will always be my baby. Dexter. Dexter, wake up. -That? -Wait a minute. Help! Hey, don't go! Too late, they left. I almost broke my neck. Wait, it's open! We can go out. I'll go first. Let's go. -Corliss. -Yes? If I don't see you after tonight ... Why wouldn't you? Daddy. -Your dad is going to kill me. -Maybe I can help. After how did he act when I went to the Penguin Club? Wait until he finds out that I took you there. I'm not supposed to see you. He is going to kill you. And I didn't even know about the gambling club. Even if he doesn't kill me, he won't let me see you for weeks. Or months, or years. Daddy doesn't hold a grudge for over a year. In a year you will forget me. Dexter, look, right in front of my house. POLICE It's full of cops! Your father will surely send me to prison. Dexter, you weren't with me today. There is no point in my father breaking you to pieces. -You know his temperament. -What are you going to tell him? I'll think something. Just remember, no matter what, you weren't with me today. I can't, I can't leave you on this alone. -I'll make up a story. -When? I don't know, give me a minute to think. My mind is totally blank. If it's not blank now, It will be when your father scolds you. Dexter, this is how I'll do it. Before it happens. My mind is blank, I can't remember anything. I have amnesia, like in the movie. -Can work. -It will work. But Dexter, remember, no matter what happens, No matter what I see or do, you weren't with me today I was not with you today. -Wish me luck. -You are awesome. Do you have any additional information? Do you have any idea of their identity? If you did, do you think you would be standing here? -Just bring Corliss home. -Sweetie. Hi. Baby. Corliss, my baby, you're fine. My baby, what happened? Where have you been? I... What were you doing? -Answer me! -What happened? I nothing. Do you arrive at five in the morning like this and say something didn't happen? Is it five in the morning? Yes, it's five o'clock , did you forget to see the clock? -I didn't forget, daddy. -And where were you? -Where was it? -Corliss, look at me, here I am. Corliss, what's wrong with you? Don't you know where you were? Where was it? If you think you can evade the question -with guessing games ... -I remember. I went to bed last night. -What do I do here? -Corliss, naughty little ... -That chair I've never seen before. -It's been there for five years. Mommy, you and daddy look different. Older. A night like this makes anyone go gray . Corliss, my love, what is it? Everyone looks very funny, where is my "yama"? What about you? Harry, don't you remember how she used to say that to her pajamas as a child? Yeah daddy it should be on my yama Where did I get these clothes? You got it from where you got all your clothes, from Bensons and I paid for it. -Harry, something is wrong. Look at her. -I see her... I am seeing it. It doesn't seem very good. Why is that cop here, Mommy? I want my Betsy doll. Corliss, baby, we gave Betsy a long, long time ago. No, I received it last Christmas. I want my doll. He had that doll when he was nine years old. They better call a doctor. Stop the nonsense. If not, Corliss ... Corliss, baby, what happened? I'm fine, daddy, really. Well, I don't think we can do anything else. -Thank you very much, officer. -I'm sorry. You know I have heard of these cases, but have never seen one before. They are very rare. Good, goodnight. Good evening, officer. Hello, is Dr. Permutton here? Because it is not? It's a bad time to bring a baby. I know he won't have it. When can I find it? Tell him Harry Archer called, it 's an emergency. -Harry, did you talk to the doctor? -No, he will call. You better find out what happens before I do. Papi. -Who won the war? -We. How do you know if you don't remember anything from the last eight years? The war has not even started. Daddy, you are so funny. The war is long over. How do you know? We won after Britain burned down Washington. You remember, We study the War of 1812 in fourth grade history. Dolly Madison had to leave the White House so fast You practically had to leave breakfast on the table. -Memory. -It was very exciting. -I know. -It was the feeling. Stop! Hi there? Doctor, you must come at once. Corliss tiene amnesia. I don't care about the baby. But ... Yes, but ... Well, if you think it doesn't matter what we wait. I see. Thank you very much doctor. It will be in that case all night. And what about Corliss? A few hours will not make any difference. Rest and attention. What is mangnesia? Amnesia, my dear. Nothing you need to worry about. Now go to sleep. I want daddy to carry me. What do you think I am? An elephant? Attention. Of course, darling. I carry you. That is no way to eat breakfast. Do you want me to feel to hear Corliss sip his cereal? She is just a girl. A girl of nine, a vermin of seventeen. I'm improving, I can almost do all of them without failing. Corliss, go up to your room to play, I can't concentrate. Daddy, you're not concentrating, you're eating breakfast. -I know what im doing. -Daddy, he's soaking it. -Take it. -Play somewhere else, love. Harry that was not attentive. It must be Dr. Permutton, I always know when it's him. For the time. Raymond, whatever you sell, I don't want it. I am not selling. Come back tomorrow or next week -or better in seven years. -I have something. -I want to see Corliss. -No this... Corliss is not feeling well. -What happens? -What happens to him is not your concern. -Now, please ... -Harry, is this a normal question? Corliss suffered a shock that affected his memory. You don't think you forgot to pay me two dollars, do you? If he owes you money, he will pay you. -Sir, Archer, he's a lawyer. -Yes. Are parents not responsible of the debts of your minor child? When these debts are contracted, according to law... Raymond... Corliss gave me his journal to cover with fur. Owes me two dollars and if she doesn't pay me you are responsible. Listen, little one, get it out before I ... You don't need to get aggressive. -You better go, Raymond. -If Corliss lost his memory, Why don't they try to get it back? -Go away before ... -Remind him of everyday things. A movie I saw worked, it was very silly, but it worked. Thanks Raymond, the doctor will try that method for sure . But they must know what to remind you of. This is your journal. You will remember each day you forgot. What that diary has we know -and we'll tell you. -Harry, maybe it will. Okay, I 'm just trying to help. I think it's silly, Janet But if you think it will be easier, we can do it. Thank you Raymond for being so considerate. -We will try. - It's two dollars. Out of here! Harry, what if we read her the things that were important to her? I think so, Janet. Corliss! Corliss. Corliss, ya basta. Corliss. Corliss, we told you your memory is affected. -I'll read you something from your diary. -I want to read it. Of course not. I want to see if you remember any of this. Okay, daddy. Today we have spaghetti and meatballs for dinner . Wait a minute, Harry. Keep going. "Today we have spaghetti with meatballs for dinner and I painted my nails a new color. It's called scarlet sin and it's my Kenny's favorite color . I know he is more of a sin than a sinner. " Mami. "I would do whatever it takes to make up those bitter experiences you've had. " -Mommy, we're hungry. -You already had breakfast. -Seriously? -Of course. "Let the world say what it wants, we are two rebellious spirits beyond the existence of the Earth ". -Harry, what are you talking about? -I don't say it, I read it. "Mommy and Daddy played cards with the Franklin and daddy got stuck in the door frame. " -That was a few days ago. -There is more. "Kenneth Marquis, what a name ...". Â¡Kenneth Marquis! "What a beautiful name. And he is so different, kind, caring, loving. I almost fainted when he suggested it to me! " "I would be very proud to be Mrs. Kenneth Marquis." "We belong to each other. I am a new woman and I know that he will be a new man. He invited me to his apartment to see his first editions. And dear diary, it has some beautiful first editions. " Veronica has fleas. "I had never lived until I met Kenneth. All these wasted years with Dexter I didn't know what I was missing. I was floating in the clouds. " Harry I don't want you to read the rest -Corliss mustn't hear it. -She wrote it. "Floating in the clouds". Daddy, is that a story about someone on a plane? I must show you what it is a story about a razor strap. -Kenneth Marquis is an idiot. -Corliss, try to think. I want you to remember. When was that ...? How you...? What's between you and Kenneth Marquis? -What is a Kenneth Marquis? -It's your dear angel. That's. Is daddy angry? Harry, I don't think so. I just can't believe it. Here it is, in your own handwriting. He did not invent it. I got caught in the door frame . And we had spaghetti and meatballs for dinner that night, But I still don't believe it, I can't. Where was it night? How did your clothes get torn? I do not know. Why did Kenneth Marquis send that box of candy? Even I can't answer those questions It can not be true. There are some things you know without being able to explain them. -What happened that gave you amnesia? -I know Corliss. That is what I must know. It can't be possible, he 's much older than her. But all of his wives were minors. Not as much as Corliss. Almost for a year or two. They were another kind of girl. Were they different before or after meeting Marquis? Corliss, daughter, try to remember, try. Did you go to see the first editions of Kenneth Marquis? Daddy, I wouldn't even recognize a first edition. She doesn't remember anything. Maybe it's a blessing. Confusing the rules of evidence. -Janet, I think you're right. -I got it, Harry. There is a way to get to the bottom of this. Yes, hello. Mr. Marquis's office. One moment, please, I'll check . Harry P. Archer. Tell him I'm in Tahiti. No, you better tell him I contracted the black plague. You're not here, Mr. Archer, do you want to leave a message? I tell him. Calling him is very important. -I can help? - I'd like to see Mr. Marquis. Me too, but I want some ads for my newspaper. I know Mr. Marquis doesn't, but I think you will be interested when you see this. -What is this? -Photocopies of a newspaper. He knows. -I'm sorry, but ... -Give them, whatever. I know he will want to see me. I will wait. Mrs. Upshaw, did you ship those contracts as special delivery? What happens? Did I grow another head? I'm not the one to tell you what you've done. There is a boy out there. If it bothers you so much, why not try hormone pills? He wants to see it. This is your card. And send him this. Come on in and stop guessing. Those guesses are self-explanatory. -Mr. Marquis will see you. -Already knew. You are Mr. Pringle, I suppose. Editor and publicist of the Pringle Herald. Mr. Marquis, his clothing makes a lot of institutional publicity. Any. Have you thought about reaching the young audience and pay for an exclusive full page for that audience? That thought keeps me from sleeping at night. I have space in my newspaper and the price is right. And if I make an ad, wo n't you print this? Those don't matter to me, they were just so I could see it. Tell me, before talking about business, Who is the author of this deadly prose? You must know, Corliss Archer. Â¿Corliss Archer? I believe it, now that you made copies, the whole city sure knows about this newspaper. You, my father and I are the only ones who have seen it. But how about an ad? Mr Pringle, you have demonstrated a business acumen that will undoubtedly make you a lot of money ... ... and will take you to the bars of Alcatraz. Take that to the advertising department . Thank you. Mrs. Upshaw, see if you can call Mr. Harry P. Archer this afternoon. Everything will be fine, I know it will. We will both lie ... I'm not going to get upset. Corliss, go to your room. Harry, regarding Mr. Marquis, don't lose your temper. I never lose my temper! I can enter? How is it going? I am Mrs. Archer. Ma'am, Archer. -Please sit down. -After you. I prefer to stand. We... It was very nice of you to come. This is embarrassing, isn't it? -It is? Why? -Well, it's just that, it's something silly, but my daughter wrote a daily class ... Really? Well I'm sure it reflects her feminine charm. Well, this diary ... I guess she talks about the volume her husband is holding with his sticky hands right now. Well this is all ridiculous and I'm sure you would be the first ... Go ahead, Harry. Read something to Mr. Marquis and he will realize the madness of the situation. "Not all women know such great love ... ... and very few can save the man they love from himself. " It doesn't read fluently, does it? "Kenny is so sweet. I'm lucky I found Kenny in time. " That Kenny is you. -Really? -It's my daughter's diary. -It's silly, isn't it? -I do not like it. It's just a schoolgirl's romantic nonsense . But there's a reason we couldn't question Corliss. Certainly after invading the privacy of your diary. It is not your business what I do. -My name is there. -I'll burn every page. Only a fool would believe this to be true. -Every word of that is true. -I knew I should thank you ... That?! I'm sorry you had than to know in his dishonest way, but since you know the truth, you must also know -that I love your daughter. -I'm going to kill him! Listen, Mr. Archer, can I call you dad? You don't have to be so mad, after all, Corliss and I ... Corliss and you? Corliss and you? Corliss! I'm going to bring it. We will get to the bottom of this. What a lovely house. -Corliss, Corliss. -Â¿SÃ­, papi? Come with me. Corliss dear, are you okay? Has it hit you? -I'm going to kill him. -God, Harry. We should discuss this calmly. Mom is right, Dad. You and I should have a man-to-man talk . and come to an understanding. I want Corliss to be ... ... my fourth and last wife. Daddy, Mommy, I don't know what he 's talking about. Corliss honey, everything will be fine, you will remember in time. I remember now, except, there is nothing to remember. I invented all that. I wrote it two nights ago just to make Dexter jealous. They have beaten you. I haven't put a single hand on that girl yet, but ... How did you remember if you have amnesia? -Corliss, what are you talking about? -Mommy, I'm horrible, sorry. I pretended to have amnesia, because I was very late last night, But I don't know why Mr. Marquis says it's true. Of course it isn't, I just made it up How did you do that? Why did you pretend to have amnesia? I will... You were late. Early morning. Dear Corliss, your fears break my heart, But just think about our future Two jubilant rebels sure of their love, Facing the world together I am not a rebel. Harry, we didn't read that part of the journal to you. No. Please, I persuaded them to be his son-in-law, I can't think of a bigger concession. Cretin. If there were no women present ... Dad, we shouldn't argue. I want you to be as happy as me now that Corliss and I are ... After all, we are practically strangers. When you know me better, you will come to love me. Corliss, where were you until five in the morning? It's our secret. Your intimidation of that poor girl bothers me . -Do not get into this. -Seriously, daddy, it's the truth. You must believe me, I was with Dexter last night. They locked us in the basement of the Penguin Club. Daddy, I'll call Dexter, he'll tell you. My dear, you have nothing to fear and nothing to hide. Don't run away. Can I sit? Harry, maybe Mr. Marquis wants something cold to drink. Dexter, Dexter, come here quickly. "Is everything okay with your father?" -Yes Yes! Dexter? Is it some cartoon character? I have more evidence as well. Mildred helped me write it. I'm going to call her. The night Raymond stayed he brought her toothbrush and things. I thought I was the only one who knew your secrets. Why don't you tell him the truth? Hello, Mrs. Pringle, this is Janet Archer. Is Mildred there? -Is not found. -Hello what's going on? -Dad, you tell him what's up. -Dexter, you have to tell him ... I will ask the questions without you ordering let him perjure himself. Where were you last night, Dexter? -Who? I? -Dexter, tell him ... Don't talk, Corliss. Where were you last night? Who? I? I'm asking and if you ask again I will break all the bones in your body. Where were you last night? With Herb Brown, I stayed at his house. Have you seen Corliss since I forbade you? No, but is it okay if I come back? We will discuss that another day. Thanks, Dexter. What's going on? Dexter, please tell him the truth. Well I did see Corliss once When I was driving by Schroeder's and she was walking in I greeted her, but did not stop to speak to her. God, Mr. Archer, I would never disobey you. Dexter, tell him we went to the Penguin Club last night. Who? I? If she asked me , I would take her to the Penguin Club. Tell him they locked us in the basement. Do you really want me to tell them that? Yes Yes. We were locked in the basement of the Penguin Club. -Because of the raid. -Because of the raid. You know There is something admirable in the way How this boy tells the story Lie like a gentleman a fairly immature gentleman of course, but like a gentleman. -Who? I? -I see what you mean, dad. -You can go now, Dexter. -Who? Sure, me. See you. They see him? I told you. That? They listened to Dexter. It is true. When Mildred gets home she's going to ... Why don't you believe me if I tell you the truth? Right, amnesia. Go to your room. I'll keep our secret from last night. Rebels to the end. Daddy, far from me meddling I think you got terribly mad at Corliss. Can you try to stop being the stern father and be his friend more? You're a meddlesome barbarian scoundrel . -Harry, don't say such things. -I forgive him, I forgive him. My love for Corliss is so great that I can love you too. I would like to be more than a son- in- law to you. For her sake I would like to be more like ... ...a son. I'll leave the door open. Hi there? Doctor. Yes, yes, I understand, but you don't need to come. No, Corliss did not lose his memory. But the head. KENNETH MARQUIS AND CORLISS ARCHER GET ENGAGED Don't you get tired? Is it all you have to say to your friend who will join in holy matrimony? You are going to join in holy marriage the hard way. Make no mistake, Ken, you are an idiot. You realize...? For reasons she knows, this Archer girl wrote romantic nonsense about me in your diary. And I couldn't pass up the opportunity The man squirming and I said it was true Sure. Of course and of course Archer will sue you for breach of promise when you refuse to marry her. He's not stupid, he's going to sue you for every penny. We won't get to that, because I won't be his son-in-law. You can answer? Mr. Harry P. Archer wants to see you. Come in. -Did you see this? -I gave them the story. And you? Dad, won't we all be happy together? - You're a ... - Congratulations, Archer. Shut up! I will sue your client ... Dad, I hope Corliss didn't inherit your bad temper. What do you mean by that? Answer me! Answer me. Do you think he was just frivolous with the love of a woman? I wouldn't let Corliss marry you if ... Call and issue a denial. No, all denials will be issued by you. We do not want a breach of promise. I'll get a denial in the newspaper for ... ... six o'clock or maybe earlier If I can get them to print a special edition. Well, if your daughter's happiness is very important to you, I will try to tell everything, bravely. -Of course he's angry. -It can happen to anyone. Look, Veronica, right on the cover. Harry, what is it? They have followed me all day, wherever I go. People follow me suspiciously. I'm lucky to have such a wealthy son-in-law. A man I don't know followed me home asking me to sell life insurance to Marquis Now that you have a new responsibility, which is you. Do you know why the story was published? -Marquis told everything. -Daddy, he's beyond crazy. There is something wrong psychologically with that man. -Like amnesia? -What about the retraction? What would it look like if the engagement was canceled the same day? People know that Corliss was missing for hours. The police, the calls I made to locate her. Marquis's reputation, the talk. -Harry, it doesn't make sense. -We must calm down. I'm fine now. I'm fine. I forgot to put the car in the garage. Forget the car. All the way I was wondering what people will think. Would it be better for this wave of publicity to disappear and then break the engagement? Daddy, I'm not engaged, if I was, I should know. This is your fault, little girl Why didn't I have two sons instead of one daughter? It doesn't matter if a boy doesn't know how to say no. I don't want to see anyone, I'm not at home. I left because I had a nervous breakdown. Louise, say we're not here. Does that woman have to cry all the time? Please, Harry. What's the matter with you? It's the first time you've played in fourteen years. Things are already different. It's on the back porch. I came to congratulate you. Don't be silly, Dexter, I have enough problems already. -I hope you're very happy. -Stop acting like Emily Post. I need help. Do you think I want a 37 year old goat -that has already been married three times? -Thirty-seven? He is almost the same age as Jack Benning. God, Corliss, I don't know how you could do this to me. I know you have more money than me But he's not as crazy about you as I am I didn't do anything to you or anyone else, but no one believes me. Everything is a mistake. So you won't marry Marquis? Of course not. I wrote some silly things about Marquis and me in my journal. But now nobody believes me that everything is made up. I believe you. When i read the newspaper it was like getting hit on the head with a baseball. I never felt so bad since Jefferson lost the game to Emerson. It's just Dexter. Yes, it's me. Dexter, could you excuse us? -Sure. -Goodbye. Corliss, your mother and I ... Darling, your father and I decided it would be better if we cancel the engagement later. Any retraction ... Right with the recent announcement of the engagement, people might ... Anyway, we decided to wait. -Harry, please. -So? Yes, we are. We must face this sooner or later. If they come from the newspaper, leave it to me. -Don't talk, Corliss. -I can't even ...? -No. -Mildred! -Where have you been since yesterday? -I was... It doesn't matter, you're already here. Now you will see. -I do not doubt it. -Corliss, I read the newspaper. Don't you get excited? It is the worst disaster of my life that I have been in. All for that silly diary we write. -What newspaper? -You know, the one that ... What do you mean by that? The diary we wrote when you spent the night here. Yes. The night of the candy box . From your fiancÃ©. I wrote one page and you wrote another. We were trying to make Dexter jealous , you remember. You may have amnesia. "I barely felt her lips", you wrote that. -Seriously? -Yes. And you also wrote about the Marquis apartment. And why would you write in your journal? Because you... She... I... Do you really think I have amnesia? Hi there? Hi there? Hi there?! No, I have no statement for the Brookland Eagle. -Yes. -I'm from the Irish press. Sorry, we won't see the press. Hi there? Hi there? Hi there? -I'll go out the back door. -So, bye, darling. I'm sorry. I'll take care of this one. From Mr. Marquis to Corliss Archer. Marquis. A perfume. Oh my God. Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday. "May your nights light up with the memory of the hours we spent together. " Mr. Archer, about the two dollars ... Another time, Raymond. Tell us, what's there, daddy? Nightgowns Goodbye. Tuesday. Wednesday. Thursday. Friday. Saturday... Kiss me and tell me. Who...? He knew he had to use his car sooner or later. -Who are you? -Hal Fitzmond ... -I don't care, go away. -Glimpse Magazine. Go now. Sorry, I thought favorable publicity would be more welcome. - All I want is ... - For me to go, I know. It is very emotional. How are you. It's a good magazine he works for. Are you one of their subscribers? It's silly to buy a magazine when you can read it for free at the pharmacy. He did not approach in the proper way. -What is your advice? -Exchange of secrets. -What type? -Newspaper. - News of circulation? -Editorial. Se llama Pringle. Raymond Pringle. Pringle Herald. -It's weekly. -Well. Here's a copy. Where did you get this newspaper story from? I have photocopies. Well why don't we have a soda from journalist to journalist? I invite. Okay, I'll show you a shortcut. I've been thinking about this a lot . The only reason Kenneth lied about the diary is that he wanted so much that she was his wife, -because he loved me terribly. -He and how many more? The others don't count. But seriously, Dexter, why else would I lie? I too would have lied. I do not have as much affection as you, but he needs me. It has so little. Have you seen that convertible car he drives? Money can buy that, but it is not everything. It does help though. He has had three wives and I have not even one. Can't you see, Dexter? He's had those wives, because he's looking for the one. He said he finally found me. It's a fantastic kind of responsibility though . He was hurt by those horrible women he married. He wants a home and children. What if I disappoint him? We used to talk about what we would do when we got married. I wanted a yellow convertible, you an electric dishwasher. I want you to know that now I wo n't have a yellow convertible -it does not matter what happens. -Dexter. But I don't care if you have a dishwasher. Really. I would like to say that as president of the citizens committee, I present my resignation. No, not that. I would like to say ... What do i mean? Maybe if you sit down and write it down, dear. And that has to do? I do not think if I feel. Harry. Dog! I would like to say ... Hi there? That? Western Union. That? No, no, read it, please. Just say it. "Seattle. See you on Thursday. A kiss to my favorite niece. -George. "" Uncle George! Yes thanks. Well, what do we do now? I thought you were in the Marine unit in Alaska. It arrives tomorrow. Harry, do you think ...? Advertising has died down in the last week. He has been at sea for a month. Let's not say anything. So when he leaves we will make a discreet announcement that the engagement has been canceled. Save the day. Corliss, now that the decision has been made, Is there something you want to tell us? About what? On tribal customs beyond the Amazon. Baby your father and I would feel better If you would tell us the truth about yourself and Mr. Marquis. -But I already told you ... -Okay, darling. Better not. Mommy, do you feel better seriously If I tell you that everything in the newspaper was true? We couldn't feel worse. The most painful part in this love affair is knowing that you did not tell us. Ok mommy If that would really make you feel better, it's all true. I think now I will go to my room to rest. At least until Frankie's show time . -The romantic little idiot. -Hi there. Dexter. -I always believed in her. -I touched but they didn't open. If I had appreciated something, for the slightest bit , it would have been corroborated in that fantastic story of yours. Mr. Archer, I want to talk to you, I need legal advice. -Harry, how could he? -It's a pressure ... I tried to understand. Sometimes I think I am going crazy. -I know. -It's about blackmail. Hi Dexter, I thought I heard your voice. I've been talking to myself. "Listen, Mr. Archer ... " "Not now, Dexter, not now." -Morning? -Yes, yes, tomorrow. I think you already know about this Glimpse article, it came out today. It's a nice picture of you, Corliss. I am the father of a girl with the reputation of Catherine the Great. Uncle George is here. -Hi, Corliss. -Uncle George. -George is open-minded. -But he's a military chaplain. Maybe you don't know yet. Don't mention it unless he does. -Did you have a good trip? -I had a great trip, comfortable. Janet. -Good to see you, George. -Hello, Harry. They all look radiant including my favorite niece. It's amazing to have you here, Uncle George. My visits are getting a bit superstitious. Every time I come, Corliss is engaged. You look great. I got your postcard with the glacier. -George, how long will you stay? -Only three days. -Is it a short visit? -You must stay longer than that. Let's not discuss that. You want breakfast? Yes. No thanks, they gave me a great breakfast on the plane. All I need is a moment to clean up. Yes of course. Corliss, take your uncle to his room. It will only take five minutes. -It's been a ... -You want this? A century has passed without seeing you. You must tell me everything that happened to you, everything. I'm afraid to tell you that you will find my activities quite boring. Let's go. One hundred and forty billion people in this country. No more than a million bought this magazine this week and he had to be one of them. Do you realize the reputation it will have if we cancel the engagement? Do we have the right? The right? You are crazy? We have a duty. If you think for a moment that I will let her marry that man ... Listen, Harry, if that diary is telling the truth and it seems so, so Corliss is really in love with him and he with her. Hello, Mr. Archer. -Dexter. -Today is tomorrow. I'll make a note of that on my calendar. Do you mind, Dexter? We are very busy. But he promised that he would talk to me about the blackmail today. Right now there is nothing in the world what I'd like to talk to you about, now go! I'm leaving! Are you trying to tell me that we should leave That little girl get married ...? Darling, we can't choose who she'll marry. She is in love of him. But of all men ... I do not know. We shouldn't interfere. Maybe we should let her marry him if it is what you want. I do not know. George. What's new, George? I sent Corliss to the pharmacy for a newspaper. -But we have all of today. -I wanted to talk to you. Yes, I wanted to hear about your cruise in Alaska. What about Corliss and that Markee? -Marquis. -Marquis. It was as if a bomb exploded in my lap. We were also surprised. There is a great inequality of ages. She's young enough to ... Well, to marry a man of that reputation. Well, they say that love conquers all. I think they are right. -When is the wedding? -It will be... We haven't decided yet. I always promised myself to officiate Corliss's wedding, But this, well, I can't disagree more. Why does that man discard women as if they were shoes? He does not know the meaning of the holy marriage. It's okay, Janet. You know what I think of these things. But out of respect for you and Harry, I will officiate the ceremony. And we can only hope that since they are in love, it will turn out very well. Three wives. Well, maybe four is the lucky number. If I were Archer, I 'd be after you with a gun. The gun is for cases where the groom is reluctant. I, on the other hand, am gasping with excitement. A mistake And you'll be the old wealthy Mr. Marquis. Aparte from Archer, your shareholders will not accept any more escapes from court. -Yes? -Mr. Archer. Is Dad. You may want another retraction. Hi dad, this is my son. Your language. I don't know why you are so angry. Everyone knows that young love is impetuous. Please, daddy, dear. I think I notice a certain aggressiveness in your tone. What about you? Consent? That? When? I see. Seriously? Then no. You will do it? Who? I? I am about to become her husband. That's good, Louise. Well, a rehearsal will be fine. Wait in the corridor until you hear the wedding march. Up, get up. We are all here now. The groom usually has his father or brother next to him. Do you have a close relative who might ...? Any of my ex-wives? I do not think so. Let's get this over with. Louise. Dear beloved, we are reunited, etcetera, etcetera. To unite this man and woman in marriage , etcetera etcetera. Well there's no need to go beyond this part of the essay. Of course, I already know it by heart. I'll wait outside. It seems I talked too much, right? Maybe I can comfort and talk to Janet and Corliss. Excuse me. Cheer up, comrade. If providence blesses you with a grandson, we'll call the little imp, Harry P. Marquis. The field is ours. Another minute more and I was going to end up crying. Can you explain to me how I ended up in this position? Because you took time to understand how little judgment you have. Try to get out of this and you will have a demand for breach of promise and your shareholders, and I can continue the list. Well, of course this is not one of the happiest weddings I have ever participated in. Maybe I'm spoiled but the others were more fun. I don't know, I thought the blood in your father-in-law's eye it gave it a touch of festive color. Don't say it, Dexter. I am thinking the same as you. Only in worse language. I think I'll be single for the rest of my life. At least you won't have a daughter to worry about. Anyway, I don't know if I could afford a wedding. At least not in the way I'm paying. I'm broke. I'm very attached to you, Dexter. I always hoped that one day. Well, if you want a dollar or two ... No, that wouldn't help. Jimmy Phillips is paying me two dollars a week. And I will likely continue like this for the rest of my life. It's all because of that night I spent with Corliss. When did you spend the night with Corliss? -Don't tell my father. -Answer my question! The night we went to the Penguin Club And we were locked in the basement Jimmy saw us and would tell my parents if I didn't bribe him, they would kill me. You do n't deserve ... Were they ...? Is there evidence? Did anyone see them? Can you prove that you and Corliss were together that night? -Sure. -Dexter! But why did that weasel lie? Come on, Dexter. George, do you have any hobbies? Do you collect things? I have a large collection of ancient rocks. From which I could throw each one of them. Harry. So you were with Corliss all night? Don't embarrass her in front of all these people. You lied, why? Dad. Corliss was with Dexter that night. It's true, daddy, it was. Young man, what have you been doing with my fiancee? -It was an accident. -See, daddy? It was true. About that night and about the newspaper. -What about the diary? -My client won't confess. -Shut! -Temperament, temperament. I have the answer if you want to make a deal. The only thing I was missing was this little monster. Pay me my two dollars and I'll tell you the further story. Raymond, tell us what you know right now. Mr. Marquis sent Mildred some clothes. Asked him to go with the flow and not to say anything about the newspaper. -He bribed my best friend. -I'm going to kill him! "Wait, Harry!" -I will kill him! Baby. -Harry. -No, I'll kill him. -I'll hit him. -No no no. I sense hostility towards me in this room. Unless there is a change in attitude, I'm leaving. -Sorry? -I will kill him! -Archer. -I'm going to kill him! Archer, I am a witness to the fact that my client acted in good faith, legally. But if someone wants to hit him, go ahead. Please, George, let me kill him. This is a great shame. Now he won't have the chance to love me like a son. See you later, daddy. No, George, I've made up my mind. I'm going to kill him. -Harry. -Let him go, George. Marquis deserves everything Harry wants to do to him. And now why are you crying? I'm very happy. I have things to fix with that guy too. You stay here Dexter you don't have to get hurt. God, they won't hurt me, I can take care of myself. I haven't seen anything like this since the Gettysberg fight. -Corliss! -God, just think. It is like in the Middle Ages. Daddy and Dexter went out to fight Mr. Marquis for me. It's better than on TV. Corliss, I'm so happy it was all a mistake. Me too Mommy. And if I want to marry someone, at least I want to be Dexter's first wife. -I never believed it. -Look, look! That's right, right in the butt. Where are you going? To the kitchen for ice and everything. Harry, what happened? Get that idiot dog out of my sight. The animal attacked me and not him. Veronica, did you bite daddy? -Of course he bit me. -Harry. "Mr. Archer, this is terrible." -Louise, bring ice, quickly. Raymond will bring them, can I bring a cold towel? Do something, don't stand still! I'm bleeding. Harry, don't yell at her, you make her nervous. What is more worrying? Your nerves or my life? -I thought you would kill him. -Daddy? All right, put some on the back of his neck. They are not for him, they are for Marquis, he's worse. I don't understand Harry In college you were a light heavyweight champion. I hate Kenneth for what he did to your poor nose. I'm blind! Dexter dear, did your hand hurt you too? Mother, look at Dexter's hand, it 's bleeding. It's just a scratch, it's not my blood. God, I'm sorry about your nose, Mr. Archer ... Look at that, it looks terrible. -I'm so sorry. -Dexter, is it my father's blood? I think so. Get him out of here. "Dexter Franklin, I hate you!" -Hey, I'm sorry. He got behind when I was going to hit, it was not my intention. Go away, Dexter Franklin! Get out of this house and don't come back! -Who? I? -Get out of my sight and my life! Who? I? I'll kill him if he asks me again ! -You hit my father. -Harry, calm down! You're spilling blood all over the Persian carpet. I'll throw all the blood I want to Persia if I want to! Louise, bring more ice. Why did you do it, worm? I never want to speak to you again in my whole life. I can't help it if I don't know my own strength. Again! I will kill him! -God, finally, it's wonderful. -Let me kill him. -To who? To me? -I will kill him! It is justified homicide.
