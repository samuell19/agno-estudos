HUNT Mohan, the case is solved. I found Aryan's killer. Aryan was killed by... Hey... hey... hey! It's me. - Your... your name? - Mohan. Mohan Bhargav. Commissioner of Police. Your closest friend for fifteen years. Nothing to worry. The doctor said all you need is a few days of rest. You were going at a normal speed. A bike rolled out of a vehicle before you. While trying to avert collision there was an accident. Over there. You were talking to me then. [MOBILE RINGING] Good evening, sir. Uh, he has just been discharged, sir. He will take charge in a couple of days. Okay, sir. High profile murder case. An Assistant Commissioner was shot in broad day light by a sniper. My superiors and the media, are exerting a lot of pressure on me. Especially on you. If we don't give this case a conclusion soon, it will affect our career. May be it will end. You have solved this case. On the day of the accident we left the bar at seven. After that you discovered a very important evidence related to this case. There were no incoming calls in your call list. There was one single outgoing call. It was your call to me to tell me... ...you have solved the case. I don't remember anything. After we left, you took forty minutes to navigate a distance that needs only 20. Did you stop on the way, any deviations, slow down? It could be anything. But you solved the case in that gap. Keeping all this aside, the departed Aryan Dev... was not just an Assistant Commissioner of Police. He was a great friend of ours. Geetha's phone. My wife. Except the doctor and me, everyone thinks you are perfectly fine. It's just an accident. She was not allowed into the hospital because of police norms. So, tell her you will come tomorrow morning. Speak. Uh, I am alright. Uh, I ate. Er... Subway... Subway. Tomorrow... I will meet you tomorrow. Sir? On the way, sir. Okay, sir. I have an urgent meeting. I got to leave. Okay? Here. 711 on seventh floor. - Can you go? - Uh... - Security? - Sir? Take sir to 711. Don't allow anyone without my permission. Okay. Okay, sir. Does someone else live here too? I mean do I live with someone? No. - What is your name? - Shyam, sir. - How long have you been working? - For five years, sir. Where were you last night? Everything is under control, sir. CC cameras are not functioning here. We found a shoe and a gun. It's difficult to track the gun, sir. Country made. We are gathering information on the shoe. Okay, sir. Sir! Mohan sir wants to talk to you. Hello! Who are they? I don't know who attacked me. Can you recognise them? They were wearing masks. I hope you are fine? I am... I am okay. Just minor injuries. Okay. I will pick you up in the morning. Take good rest. Okay! This is Ravi. Colony president... The other day you got drunk and behaved rudely with Mr Madhu's wife. We have decided in the meeting that you must vacate immediately. So, do that ASAP. Hey, Arjun! This is Kamal. I am so sorry to know about your accident. Wishing you a speedy recovery. Get well soon, Arjun. Hey, bloody policeman! You got you deserved. God exists. You tortured me using the third degree! Die in the hospital, scoundrel. Buying a cigarette from that shop is a part of your daily routine. Go and get yourself a cigarette. Check if you can get some information from him. May be... you had stopped at the shop before your accident. Sometimes when we talk to people, we may find some clues. Which brand? You don't have to ask. Just go and he will give you. Hello? Sir, Prabhakar here. - Er... who? - Sir, it's me. Prabhakar. Minister Rammohan Rao sir's Personal Secretary. I... I am a bit busy. I will call you back. Sir, sir, sir. I heard you have been discharged. I wanted to visit you in the hospital. But I couldn't. I heard investigation is in the last stage. Minister sir asked me to call you for an update on the case, sir. Uh... I'll... I will call you later. - Sir, sir! - I will call you later. - Sir, sir, sir! One minute... sir... - Yeah. - How much a dozen? - Sixty rupees, madam. Is that final? I can give you for fifty final, madam. Give me a cigarette. When did you get discharged from the hospital, sir? - Yesterday. - Uh, huh. It's okay, sir. You always pay me at the end of the month. You don't have to pay now. Hey, Arjun! What's up, man? You are discharged? You didn't even call me! I was discharged yesterday. Hey, listen. My new schedule has started and work has been crazy of late. That's why I couldn't visit you at the hospital. I am really sorry, man. I will see you around. Take care, man. Who is he? No idea. Who was on the phone? Personal Secretary of some Minister. He wanted the case details. Some TV reporter called me this morning the same way. Ignore them totally. They try to force information. Tell them you are in a meeting or busy no matter who calls. Did you tell them anything? Seriously? I didn't get a single word of what he said. Because I don't know what's happening. Someone attacked me at the apartment. I am supposed to be a drunkard. They want me to vacate the flat. I don't understand what is happening around me! I just feel like a puppet, man. Every place I go to and every person I meet remains a question to me. I have only questions right now. No answers. But to find the answers, I must find out who I am. Who am I? Arjun Prasad. Assistant Commissioner of Police. Cyberabad. Crime Branch. A very good morning to all our esteemed officers and bureaucrats. Esteemed Governor, Rajkumar Purohit, IG, Ganesh Venkatram, Commissioner, Mohan Bhargav and all our other dignitaries! We welcome you all. We are here today for a very special occasion. I now invite Aryan Dev... who led the team and executed the Harqatul Commando operation for which he is being awarded President's Gallantry Award for Bravery for 2022. Congratulations, Mr Aryan Dev. An eminent police officer in Q-One, now making our Telangana proud. I now request you to speak a few words on this occasion. Honourable Governor, District Collector, my superior officers, colleagues, friends and well wishers! I am not a good police officer. I don't even know how a good police officer should be. When I think of how I became an IPS, it still surprises me. I never treated this position with respect. But more than me... thanks to this position... wherever I go, I get more respect. For an average police officer like me... to stand before you all and take this award... [INDISTINCT VOICES] Aryan! Hurry up! Cover the Governor. Go, go, go! Come on. Aryan, Aryan, Aryan! Ambulance! - Send this footage to the forensic, okay? - Okay, sir. Boys! Building! Building, building! Move. Hey, move! Get in, quick! Battalion! Attention! Battalion! Right shoulder, arms! Do you want to go somewhere? Away from all this for a few days? Do you believe we'll forget Aryan then? Whether we stay here or go somewhere, from our life and from our thoughts... we can never separate Aryan. The time and moments we spent with him, will stay with us forever. He entered our lives unexpectedly. He created beautiful memories. And then he left as swiftly. I must know why he left and how. As a friend and as a police officer. Until then, I can't accept that Aryan is no more, Mohan. I must find out. And I will. We cannot identify the suspect with this image, sir. There are four junctions to reach the parade grounds. Check all the cameras and get all the footage. Also, verify if the terrorist group is involved. Our intelligence agencies will have information on their weapon range. Meanwhile, let us identify the weapon used in the crime scene... and then check if it matches their arms. To stand before you and take this award... The shot was straight through the heart. The bullet entered through his chest and exited through the lower back. It penetrated through the lungs too. Also the gun powder residue in the body is very less. It means, from a distance very far from the crime scene, the firing must have been done that day. Right? So, then I guess you must have found the cartridge at the crime scene? Isn't it? We searched through hundred meters around the ground, sir. But there was no cartridge. Sir, if the gun was fired within hundred meters, the sound would be explosive. Surely, the firing happened much beyond it, sir. Someone might have deliberately removed the cartridge from the crime scene, sir. How long did it take us to take control of the crime scene? One hour, sir. But we can't identify the weapon without the cartridge. Sir, we can research fire arms, sir. We can identify the weapon from the wound on the victim's body. I have read about it, sir. If you agree, we can start the research right now. Sir, you find such things only in books. In many cases, irrespective of the weapons used, - the victim's wound is the same, sir. - But the victim... Victim... victim... victim! Has the guy no name? Or have you forgotten? Call him Aryan. Give him the same respect now as you gave him when he was alive. [BOTH]: Yes, sir. - He is not a bloody victim. Is that clear? - [BOTH]: Yes, sir. Did you collect the names of guests at the event? Yes, sir. 127 invitees, sir. With VIPs and public, the number may go up to 200 to 300, sir. I need statements from all of them. I will take care of the VIPs and family members. - Meet the rest of them. - Okay, sir. Sir, some of the guests have already left the state, sir. I don't care who they are or where they are. I want their statements on my table in three days. - Do you understand? - [BOTH]: Yes, sir. Sir. As per the ballistic report, the bullet covered the distance of 100 to 200 meters. Analyzing the angle of the bullet that hit Aryan, it was fired from one of the buildings on the left of the parade grounds... most probably from the fifth or sixth floor. So, what we guessed was right. Exactly. After the firing, I saw a guy escape from the same building. Hair strands, finger prints, body fluids, we found none of them, sir. All that was left was a packet of chilly powder. Even the sniffer dogs couldn't help. Perfectly planned murder, sir. On the day the crime was committed, Roy was there at the CC TV camera at Skyline Junction, sir. The junction is at a distance of 500 meters from here. - Who is Roy? - Ex.Criminal, sir! His red shirt matches the red shirt the suspect was wearing, sir. He lives in the slums of Borabanda. We contacted the gangs he worked for. But none of them are in touch with him. Shakti! Sir! Speak to the residents of the next apartment. - Check if you can gather some information. - Okay, sir. Take Murthy along. Uh... I can do it myself, sir. Ego? Murthy has a lot of experience. Take him. Okay, sir. The night before the murder, since my husband was taking the early morning flight to the US, I had a late dinner and was cleaning up the kitchen. I could see a car parked from here. - Time? - Er... around 11 to 11.30? After my husband left at 1am, the car was still there. I didn't see anyone getting down. It felt a bit strange that a car was parked there at that hour. Was the car still there in the morning? I woke up a bit late in the morning. I didn't notice. Do you remember the car number or model? Old model Honda Accord. Green colour. My husband used to drive the same car. Sir, I took the list of Green Color Honda City cars in the city. There is a potential suspect in the list, sir! Well-maintained. No one would believe this is 2008 model. Where were you on 14th and 15th last week? Does anyone use this car in your absence? - No. - Colonel! - Any problem? - No. Are you sure? I'll handle this. You just carry on. Do you know Roy? Criminal? No? What is your schedule for 20th, next week? You will have to come to the Commissioner's office. For the sake of old grudges, are you going to drag me into this case? I will take permission from your superiors. We will have some coffee. You even went to Mumbai two months ago. I found your name on the passengers' list. See. Mom and dad live there. Don't mind me asking you again. Do you know him? You don't? - Hello! Tell me. - Sir, we have enquired about Roy. He is not responding to our calls. But we could trace his location. [INDISTINCT VOICES] Hey, hey! Go, go. Hey! Stop! Hey, hey! Bro, he is stealing the bike. - Come. Come, scoundrel. - Sir, please, sir. - Come on! - Sir, listen to me. Let go of him, sir. - Please, sir. - He doesn't know anything. - Come! Come! - Wait, sir. Please leave him, sir. - Sir, sir! - Tell me. - Sir, please listen to what I say, sir. - Hey, hey! Hey, weren't you at the Skyline junction on the fifteenth? - Please leave him, sir. - Hey! Speak only when I ask you to. - Don't abuse, sir. - Hey! Tell me, tell me. What is it, huh? Don't try to extract from me the answer you are looking for. These threats are not new. We have the footage of you leaving the building. Idiot! Speak. Someone called me to discuss something. So I went there. I noticed some commotion in the ground and ran away. That's all. - Are you telling me stories? Huh? - Sir, sir, please leave him. - Hey, get lost! Move! - Please sir! Don't you touch her, you wretch. Huh? Sir... - Don't touch her like this? Huh? - Hey! - Is this okay? - Or check this... check this. - Hey, leave her! Let her go! - Can I touch her like this? - Hey! I will kill you! Leave her! - Or like this? - Hey, take him away. - Leave her! - Take him! - Hey! Leave! Hey, hey! Come! - Hey! Let go of her. - Hey! Take her along. Move! [MOBILE RINGING] Hello? It's Niveda. - I was asked to call you. - Yeah, yeah. - I need to meet you. - When can I? I am in Mumbai right now. I am reaching Hyderabad by evening flight. Okay, I will call you back. These are the statements from those who attended the event. Nothing unusual in them. This is the initial investigation report from the Srinagar police. They confirmed there is no connection between this and the Harkatul shoot out. They say that only to escape from responsibility. An expert sharp shooter is involved. And he used a very sophisticated weapon. In spite of knowing this... how can they say this is not connected to Harkatul shootout? Tell them intelligence agencies will be involved if they don't co-operate. Okay, sir. Hello? I want to meet you in the evening. Around eight 0' clock. - Okay, Mohan. - Okay. Before you met with the accident, we both met up at this bar. Over there... We sat at that table. DGP has called. He is totally frustrated there is no development in the case. Let them investigate then. No point in blaming him. Too much of pressure from the minister. What can he do? Aryan's family raised a complaint too... that there are no further developments so far. We have three solid suspects. Colonel Vikram, Roy and terrorist group. Don't they think these are developments? All these three have a connection. We must find it. Mohan, the man who died is not a random guy to me to take the investigation easy. He is my dear friend, damn! You don't have to hang your head before anyone. Just trust me. To be exact, between leaving the bar and the accident, you solved the case. Mohan, the case is solved. I found who killed Aryan. Aryan was killed by... Hey, hey, hey! The case that Arjun couldn't solve, should be solved by this Arjun now. I don't know the people in the case diary. I don't remember the places. I don't even know who I am... There is no one in the case diary, Arjun. There are only witnesses, suspects and clues. You don't need anything else. There is a record of statements from the suspects. That is enough, Arjun, to solve this case. You have only lost your memory. Not the thinking ability. I can't trust any other officer the way I trust you. But in the situation I am in... permission from the superiors... No one knows about your medical condition, Arjun. Except the doctor, you and me. Everybody thinks it was just an accident. You are fit to solve this case. I am just beginning to face reality. I still can't believe I am a complete police officer. Can I meet my doctor once? Twelve of my men surround you with weapons. I didn't come for an altercation. I didn't kill the policeman. Don't drag me into this case for no reason. I didn't do anything. I was there that day because some person told me he had some work with me... and lured me there with money. But he didn't turn up. Here. This is the number I got the call from. That is my phone call record. Check. I gave up this business and I am living for my family. Don't provoke me again. He was Arjun A and you are Arjun B now. Arjun B has no idea of the people, incidences, and personal life of Arjun A. There is no rule that what Arjun A likes should be liked by Arjun B. They have different preferences, and different thoughts. They are like two different people. But... Arjun A's familiar languages, skills for instance driving, swimming, the police training... these are called motor skills. All these are possessed by Arjun B too. But I don't want to be Arjun B. I want to get back to Arjun A. How long before I recover? Apple Founder... Steve Wozniak... I am sure you are aware. He lost his memory in a plane crash. But within five weeks he was normal. There are many such examples, Arjun. If you ask me when you would get normal... it could be next year, next month, probably even tomorrow. Are there also cases that never recover? Rarely. But why do you want to think negative, Arjun? Be positive. Can I go back to work? Taking decisions, drawing conclusions... will they be affected by my situation? One second. This... is a case of homicide. Two psychotic criminals are involved. All the details pertaining to this case are in here. Go through the case study... and tell me who the actual criminal is. And the answer... is already with me. Uh... Case File 2... I think he is the criminal. What are you waiting for? Go to work. I am on. Yeah. I will join duty today. Good morning, sir. Sir! We gathered some information from the shoe of the assailant, sir. That shoe was not manufactured by a corporate company. It was a local retailer. It's handmade. He made eight pieces of size number nine. Now, we are trying for information on the customers who purchased them, sir. We are on it. How are you? Hmm. My daughter's wedding next week. It will be nice if you come. I will. Okay? Okay. He gave me an instant call. Asked me whether Arjun has recovered or not. I suspected something like this must have happened. Salute whenever you see your superiors. We heard lots of stories during our training. That officers in the rank of Assistant Commissioner, were transferred to traffic division for not saluting. Like this? Mm! I didn't forget this. Sit. Your next step is to know who is who in the department. Janardhan, DGP. Ganesh Venatram, Inspector General. K C Rahul, MLA Assistant Commissioner of Police Aryan Dev. I heard you took charge yesterday, sir. I had a double shift. I couldn't meet you. When will you finish all this? It's Saturday night, sir., Mostly it takes the whole night. - Okay. I will be in the car. - Hey, - Call me if necessary. - open the barricades. This is a formality, sir. I need to go. It's getting late. - Sir, please co-operate, sir. - Hey! - Please. Sir, please get down. - You know who am I? Open the barricades. - Sir, just once, sir. - I told you just open the barricades. Sir, it's our duty, sir. How do I know you are a policeman? Show me your ID. - You are just irritating me. - Please co-operate with me. It's a waste of time, man. - What is the problem? - Hmm? - Who are you? - What does matter? Do as you are told. Look. We have lots of important meetings. Many high rank officials attend them. So drinks are very common. If you have a problem, go to the army base and complain. Don't do all this road side cheap stuff. Now move! Why are you bothering me, man? I am not under Army rule to follow your instructions. But you... are in Cyberabad jurisdiction. You must do as I tell you. Otherwise I will file a case. I won't take the test. What are you going to do? Hey, you! Remove your hand! Come out, man! How dare you touch an army person! You... - Run the medical test and file the FIR. - Okay, sir. I won't spare anyone of you. Hey, hey! Leave him. Let go. Hey! Hey, Joseph! Come here, come here. Move, move, move! Hey! I won't spare you. - Hey! - I won't spare you! Stop there. I will see your end. You should have handled it more smoothly, Aryan. It was your first day! Give the phone to James. Sir! When you mess with army personnel, we must be ready for their reaction. We are taking the help of local workers. Do one thing. Stay indoors. Whatever it may be, don't step out. Okay? Arjun! Who are they all? Workers from the under construction site of a gated community close by, sir. We don't know how many of them will come. So I got these people. You arranged for protection in case the army people attack us? No shame? Remove your uniform and give it to a man you know. None of you should be here. Out! - Open the gates. Wide and clear, okay? - Yes, sir. Sir, I am worried how the army personnel might react, sir. - Did you have an altercation with them? - No, sir! - Are they angry with you? - No, sir! Who is Aryan? Look. This is your problem. A problem created because of you. Solve it yourself. Don't waste the time and effort of so many. Hey, you all go that side, you guys this way. Hey, hey... he is escaping, come fast. Hey! Got him! Where will you run now? ACP Arjun Prasad... So what. We came for one ACP but found two. I will say one, two, three... let's us attack at once. Okay! One... two... three! Hey! Why is he coming to attack us? They damaged the CCTV cameras. They planned an attack in the dark. We got the Colonel's medical report too. Alcohol in the blood is 40mg. But we haven't filed a case yet. Sir, one minute. I want to talk to you in private. What are they discussing? I think your suspension! Suspension? Forget this matter. Everything is okay. [MARATHI LANGUAGE] Hmm? Marathi? Hmm. Mohan and I worked in the Q1 branch. In Mumbai. Even I worked in Q1 for some time. But these terrorists and all... just not my cup of tea. The night is still young. Shall we go for drinks? This mess on my first day of taking charge! What an experience! I only hope it won't repeat. But your career began amidst criminals and gangsters in Mumbai. This shouldn't shock you. Actually, I never wanted to be in IPS. And this Mumbai thing... It's because of my dad, For high level contacts. After duty, there are pubs and parties. But I got bored of it. That's why I got transferred to Hyderabad. Of course, Dad was not happy about it. But, from now... only Hyderabad. - For Hyderabad. - For Hyderabad. - Cheers! - Cheers! Why only Hyderabad? Ah! Nivetha. Oh! When? Where? How? You know Xavier College in Mumbai, right? I was the guest for their annual event. I met here there. Girl there and boy here. Working as Sales Executive. She works for Audi. Um... at Hyderabad. So, that's the reason you opted for the transfer. For Xaviers. - Yes, for Xaviers and... - Xaviers! For good friendship. - Okay, bye. - Come inside. It's too late. Some other time. You are here anyway. Meet dad and my elder brother. - Come, come. Come in. - Okay. I just wrapped up the US call. - I'll update you with an email in the morning. - Okay, sir! So, look at this layout and this lay out permits... - Dad! - Sir... Uh... This is Arjun. So, you've seen the whole thing. I want you to be very clear. - Because I want you to update him in the morning. - Sure, sir. It's okay. Cool. I'll call you. Hey, come on, Aryan. You don't have to be so disturbed. Hey, I am not at all offended. He must have been busy, man. - Cheers! - Cheers! It went out of my mind right then, Aryan. Aryan! You can't forget it so easily. I understand. How many such incidents you must have faced in life? Look. In future, whenever you face such situations, come straight to me. We'll have a drink together. I have a 2500 sft spacious apartment. You can walk in anytime here. Okay? What say? Wait and watch. Some day your dad would respectfully invite me. I couldn't gain his respect and love myself for thirty years! Anyway, thanks for keeping the door open for me. Now you wouldn't know when I might walk in or how. Some day you will regret giving me access.

I am in my limits. Is Arjun around? Yes, he is right here. One moment. Githa! Hello! Githa! Tell me. If you are not interested in answering your phone, throw it away. Hey, I was busy. Too busy to spare five minutes? I thought of trying a couple of times more and come straight to your office. Next Sunday I am coming home. - Okay? - Hmm. We'll see. If you don't... Fifteen years. Life was hell. No one bothered whether I ate or not. Alone and crying... But with your entry I found balance in life. I wonder what I would do without you! I mean it! Guys! Super party, guys! Come on! Hey! What happened? [INDISTINCT VOICES] For the mess made in that party, both of you could have been suspended. But what saved you was a phone call for you from Mumbai Q1. Harkat Ul Arza, one of the most dangerous terrorist groups. In 2013, in Mumbai... behind the serial attacks on British Café and Leelavati Hospital... this was the group. Ibrahim Nadar... He is the spearhead of this group. 23 sleeper cells under the 'wanted' radar, receive instructions from him. Based on your experience in counter terrorism, you had to go to Gulmarg. Aryan joined you in this operation. That's his wife, Nasha. His son, Syed. And his adopted daughter, Emily. So, what's the plan? You wait at his home along with your team. Nadar, is coming to meet his family. I'll give you orders, once he is there. Hey, Is that phone tap? - No, sir. It's not done. - Damn! Arjun, Nasha is leaving the house. Get ready! Something is wrong. We didn't expect this. Follow her. Okay, sir. Roger that. - Keep an eye on the house. - Okay, sir! Aryan, come with me. - Shit! - Hey! Hey! Stop! Nasha, stop! I said stop, Nasha! Stop! Are you looking for me, sir? As a police officer, this was Aryan's last operation. We didn't get any phone signals connecting to Q1, sir. And... we received no prior information from Arjun. But I have been continuously trying his phone. But there was no response, sir. Hello! In the shootout out between Harkat-Ul terrorists and Mumbai's Q1 Police, Hyderabad police officers, Aryan and Arjun Prasad played a key role. Especially, Aryan shot three terrorists and saved the remaining rescue team. IG Ganesh Venkatraman is speaking live. Let's listen to him. Aryan has added to the prestige of Hyderabad Police. This incident will increase the public faith in law and order. Though I am his superior officer, a big salute to him. [ALL]: Sir! Sir, sir, sir... Please, one by one. - Please? - Sir, everyone is surprised by the precision in your firing. Do you practice firing daily? Yes. I practice every day in the firing range. That helped me most. Sir, you have become a youth icon overnight. How do you feel about such response? Absolutely happy. I dedicate this achievement to my dad. Sir, who is the Mumbai trio? You created that name. You wrote lots of articles. Rowdy police... etc, etc. About the Mumbai Trio, I have only one word to say. Friendship. Sir, how did this whole operation go? I was at the knife's edge. Fighting for the blink of his eye. I entered a room from there. Arjun followed me. It was an all out attack. Gun shots everywhere. I finished it off. Why do you ask that? Didn't you see the news papers? Public and media might buy it. Not me. Please! Please, don't kill me, sir. I am not looking for you, sir. By the time the other rescue team members reached there, the gun was in my hand. Arjun didn't tell them what happened. He didn't allow me to say either. He told the media the rest of the story. Do you know how grave your mistake is? Very unethical. I told Arjun the same thing, Mohan. Actually, I suggested opening up about it in the press meet but he didn't agree. What is your situation if things come out in the enquiry? What enquiry? The chapter was closed right then. I was feeling really pathetic to take all the credit for what he had done. But when I saw the pride and joy in my dad's eyes during the press meet... I could say nothing. That was the first time I got that kind of respect from everyone at home. One second... Hello! I felt I didn't need that respect and awards, Mohan. Who should I impress them with? He needs them more. Save electricity. Save India. This ad launches on TV on 17th. How is it? I wanted to change my relationship status on facebook after watching you act. Hm? Even my family liked it a lot. Do you know what risk I took to impress you? I know, I know. Even I wanted to marry someone who shot three terrorists. - Aryan! - Yes, boss? - Hi, sir. - Thank you. - Vodka? - No, thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. Hi, guys! Food is also ready. - Hi, guys. - Hey, Arjun. Come. So, meet the coolest officer in the state. Arjun. Arjun, this is uh... Ethics! Right? - What ethics? - What is it? Hmm? - Hm! What is it? - Nothing. Guys! Good news and bad news. What should I go with first? - Bad news! - Bad news? Arjun is being transferred to Mumbai. NIA Intelligence cadre. He has to take charge in two months. Just relax, guys. We can't all stay at the same place. What does it matter where we are? The job is the same... police. But... I will miss you all. Sorry for the language. Um... sir! What if we talk to higher officials about the transfer and... Leave it. I don't want to beg someone for this. What is the good news, sir? The President's Gallantry Award for 2022. I am not a good police officer. I don't even know how to be a good police officer. How I became an IPS still surprises me. I never looked at this position respectfully. But because of this position, I gain respect wherever I go. For a very common below average officer like me, to take this award before all of you- You have only 18 days left, Arjun, before you are transferred to Mumbai. Normally, officers in the middle of transfer are not given cases for investigation. You know it. But ignoring all the rules, using all my special powers, I put you on this. A police officer should never get so emotional about the case he is solving. But this case investigation... should not weaken our relationship. Our relationship with Aryan... should make us stronger in solving this case. The clue you found to solve this case before your accident... you must find it again. For you, for me and for Aryan. Complete case file should be on my table on the eighteenth day. It should contain answers for these questions. How? Why? Who? How? Why? Who? All answers are here in this. This is the complete investigation file. This is the case diary having clues I gathered over the last 18 days. You must read both simultaneously ...on parallel. There is a blank page at the end of the case file. The very last page. You have it fill it yourself. Only you can do it, Mohan. If this case is not solved in the next eighteen days, another officer will replace me. Some other team will replace you. And I wish it doesn't happen. We too, sir. Thank you. We made a detailed investigation on the involvement of Vikram Singh and Roy, sir. On Shakti madam's instructions. Good. But we received no information, sir. The day of the crime and the day before, Col. Vikram Singh was at the army base. But... we are yet to get a clue about Roy. He reports at the station every week. Our informers are tailing him continuously. Sir! This is the customer's information gathered from the shoe manufacturer. 34 of the 84 shoes manufactured are sold. Some of the purchasers used bank cards. We tracked their addresses. But nothing to suspect about them. A few made cash transaction. We are gathering their CCTV footage. Okay, sir. Mohan! Yeah, everything is fine. No one suspected anything. Yeah, not even Shakti and Murthy. Investigation is going on normally. Yeah. Don't you know you should knock first? Sorry, sir. What is it? When you were in the hospital, Roy's wife had come to lodge a complaint against you. That you had misbehaved with her. I spoke to her and made her withdraw the complaint. I didn't do that because she was wrong. To stop the spread of news that an officer leading the investigation behaved so badly. You behaved very cheaply, sir. Being a police officer, you shouldn't behave like this. Not even with criminals. As per our investigation, firing happened from here, right? Yes, sir. Strange. Why? Hmm. I feel it's not the right spot. It is too open. The chance of being visible is more. And also it is cross ventilated. There is too much of wind as well. It will upset the line of fire. I would never take a chance here. Report from the ballistic experts says the shots were fired from 5th or 6th floor. But you said you saw Roy running from here. I didn't do any mistake... Quit this business. I am living for my family, don't provoke me again. Sir, it was you who said back then... that it was here... But the place is too open. There is no easy escape route either. There was also evidence that they found chilly-powder here, sir. May be... it was done to divert the police. Perfect spot! With such a nice spot here, why would anyone choose the other spot? No one lives here, right? No, sir. It is still under construction. There is no wind. It's a private space. And the target is clear. The chances of firing form this building are more than the other building. Sir, we verified Roy's phone records. It was true that one day before the crime he had a call from an anonymous number. But to track that number, its records submitted were fake. You carry on. Hello? I want to meet you once. Don't come home. Can you come to the coffee shop at seven tomorrow? - Uh, tomorrow I have... - I'll just take fifteen minutes. It is very important. Okay. I see a lot of change in you, Arjun. - Are you okay? - Yeah. You don't drink coffee. After your discharge from hospital, you didn't come home even once. Uh... I wanted to but... Whenever I suggest going to your flat, Mohan acts evasive. Mohan should never know we met now. Because... I came to talk to you about Mohan. I have been watching him for a few days. He doesn't act normal at all. He is very quiet. Always lost in thoughts. You know... he shares everything with me in spite of all the work pressure. But now... did he tell you something? No. He didn't tell me anything. Aryan's death and your accident... Probably he is not able to get over them. Can you talk to him once? He might open up to you about his problem. Even if he doesn't, I am sure you can understand him. Uh... Arjun! Yes. What I saw that day was the same kind of car. I can't say it was this car in particular. But they look identical. Colour? Green. We are studying blue color cars, sir. Without strong evidence, -don't trouble Col. Vikram -Yes, sir. May be... we made a wrong estimate. But sir... how can we let go of him just because the car is not his. Everyone is aware of his tiff with Aryan sir. He is the prime suspect in this case. I hope you remember that. I remember. But I still believe he didn't do it. Hi, Arjun. How are you? Better. Actually, I wanted to meet you myself. I resigned from my job. I am going away to Mumbai. To my parents. Once I go to Mumbai, I don't wish to come back here ever. When I met you before your accident, I asked you something. I am still here for the same. Otherwise, I would have left. Nivetha! Dad is calling you. - Hello, sir. - Yes, Shakti? Sir? - Where does Nivetha stay in Hyderrabad? - Kondapur, sir. - Asian Sun City Apartments, 403. - Okay. I checked the log register. You met Nivetha on the day of your accident. Twenty minutes after meeting her, you told me this case was solved. So, you must have found some important clue regarding this case. Sit. I told them not to disturb. Whatever you told me when we last met, has to be recorded. Generally, these things are done in the commissioner's office. But... in your case... If you can repeat whatever you told me that day, I will record it. You promised me that whatever I told you would remain between you and me. After Aryan's death, I told you what only you should know. Not for everyone. You said you won't use it for your investigation and police enquiry. You promised me, Arjun. It was a different situation then. I need to know all the details again. I want to hear it again. Sorry. No, I can't. Nivetha! Nivetha! If you don't co-operate, I will have to arrest you. You can't threaten and make me speak, Arjun. For the investigation of Aryan's case, I will come to your office for any help you need. But about the video I had shown you... No! Probably you will seize my mobile. But I will make sure the video never enters the police records. Nivetha! Okay. I don't want it. It's okay. Just... my superiors have asked for it. I had no choice. That's why I had to come. I trusted you, Arjun. - I thought you were a friend. - I am. I am. Okay. I now invite Aryan to receive his gallantry award. Please come on to the stage. What is all this? I want to know what you would speak while taking the award. - Listen to me directly from the stage. - No. I should know whether you will speak about me or your parents. My dear brothers and sisters, Thanks to you all for coming here. Seriously? Is this what you plan to say? I am not a good police officer. I don't even know how a good officer should be. A common, below average police officer like me is not worthy of standing before you all and receive this award. I had lots of friends in life. They had a great influence on me. When I was seven years old, during my life at the boarding school, my friends were my only support. But... after some time, we parted ways into our respective professions. Later I tried a lot to meet them and talk to them. I couldn't. At that time, a friend walked into my life. Everyone says I get boring after two days. But this friend tolerated all my flaws... and remained my good friend. I can call him anytime. However deep a problem I am in, he would come for me. Even this award is his sacrifice. And for a fact... I killed no terrorists. I don't even have the brilliance to do it. The name and awards I got today are all his gifts to me. He should never be one of the friends I end up losing. I want his friendship life-long. The most valuable thing in my life is... the time I spent with him. That will always... stay here. Arjun! My friend! My brother! Please come on to the stage. This is yours. You deserve this, man. Go ahead. Play the video to all. You will become a hero. Tell everyone your friend was inefficient. I wanted Aryan... to be remembered as a good police officer who received the Gallantry Award. But he wanted to speak to you while taking the award. Thanks, Arjun. On behalf of Aryan. Arjun! My friend! My brother! Please come on to the stage. This is yours. You deserve this, man. If this is the vital clue I found before my accident, one thing is very clear about the killer. Someone didn't like me getting the Gallantry award. And I think, I discovered who it was before the accident. Mohan, let me call you back. I am getting a call. - Hello! - Hello, sir. Through the shoe retailer, we tracked the terrorist, sir. You cannot believe this. He is Syed Nadar. Harkat-Ul-Mujahid's Chief Commander, the dead Ibrahim Nadar's only son. He is working in a university here as a professor in Islamic studies and is training students into jihadists. Information is confirmed, sir. This is the assignment for tomorrow, okay? And... Alright. It's done for today. Thank you very much. Nice shoes. - Why did you kill Aryan? - I didn't kill Aryan. Why did you try to kill me then? Because I found Aryan's killer, right? If I have a chance, I will kill you. Not Aryan. You ran the Harkat-ul commando operation. You killed my father and others. I know it was you who killed. You can deceive all but not me. That's why I came to your house to kill you. But you escaped that day. You are right, sir. Compared to the building on the left side of parade grounds, this is a better place to shoot. What is your modus operandi? How do you go about it? First, we choose a convenient location. One day before the event, we go there. We conduct recce. We set up everything. If the location is right, this is the perfect spot. And... when is the right moment? First chance we get. The moment the target is in the gun's radar... the first time. That is the right moment. We follow the target from here. So this is the first chance you were talking about, right? I guess not. Can you rewind it once? Yeah, there. Yeah. See, this is the first opportunity to shoot. The target was unprotected here for 45 seconds. So, any professional shooter would have taken this chance. Why did the killer drop the chance? That is what I don't understand. Any professional shooter should take this chance... cannot waste it. But you said it was a perfect crime! Yeah. It is also possible that in a perfect crime... the killer need not be present in the spot. He could have used automatic sniper gun. Knowing that the target will surely reach the spot, an automatic sniper gun could have been fixed in advance. He knows his job. Gun parts were brought separately and assembled here. He is an expert at his weapon. Once the gun is assembled and the target is fixed, he can operate it from anywhere through remote control. The killer doesn't have to be on the spot. If that is the case, how did Roy, Colonel and Harkat-Ul enter the suspects list? Till yesterday you called them suspects. Today you say there is no chance of them being suspects. Are you trying to fool me? Or them? No, sir. Uh... From the left side building which is under construction... you say there is absolutely no chance of firing But before the accident, your investigation was only around that building. Why? I mean... as per the ballistic expert... Hmm. I know. I found what the ballistic expert actually said through your team. As per our discussion, firing surely happened from a building close to parade grounds, sir. I am sure about it. It must have happened either from the left or the right side of the building. But not sure exactly which building. But Arjun sir said he saw someone running from there. You can go. - Sir, may I? - Yes? Not just in this issue, sir. In all aspects of this case, Arjun sir's behavior is the same. A new suspect every day. And a new modus operandi every day. The team is not even informed why there is a change every day, sir. Sir! He asked us to remove Col. Vikram Singh's name from this case. We agreed. We couldn't find any evidence against him. But even to follow a known criminal like Roy, he didn't give us the permission. We don't know why even now. Respond, Arjun. It's my gut feeling, sir. That Roy has nothing to do with this. What sort of explanation is this, sir? Suspects are removed from the list only when there are no proofs and evidence. But Arjun sir removes suspects so that no proofs are found. You can ask him, sir. He joined this investigation team on the request of Arjun sir. Murthy sir. Please. Express yourself at least now. I lost faith that the investigation is going on in the right direction, sir. If there is a chance, relieve me from this team, sir. Please. What about you? I would like to work in the same team, sir. To be honest, everyone in the team is of the same opinion. But Arjun sir leading it is the problem for all. All are waiting for your reply, Arjun. I feel I am close, sir. All you have is two days, Arjun. Solve it. Or move out. I don't want any explanation. Okay, sir. Good evening, sir. SI, Satya speaking. I've collected the details of owners of all Honda City blue color cars in the city. I have to share small information, sir. A blue Honda City car is in our police custody. Only our police department has the chance to use it. Sure, sir. I will take care of it. I need two days more. The last two days to solve this case. Party time! Why is your home so dirty, Arjun? Huh? Hmm. Such an exhausting flight, man. Anyway, I am relieved from Qatar. We are moving to Hyderabad now. We can meet more often! Right? You are taking so many tablets after the accident? Don't use it as a pretext and say you stopped drinking. Even if you did stop, you will have to drink today. Mom and dad are pestering me about marriage. I am not at all interested. Um... Uh... Yeah! This will do. Looking good, man. Hey! - What? - Go! What happened? Go. What? Who the hell are you? Huh? Huh? You are kidding, right? No! Are you crazy? Go. Go. I said go. I said... go! Arjun, please don't behave like this. Please. Please don't do this to me. Please. - Didn't I ask you to leave? Get lost! - Please, please... I told you to get lost! Go! Did you find a better option than me? Hey! I said get lost! Get out! You...! So did you use me all these years? Arjun... Arjun... please don't do this to me. Arjun... Arjun... listen to me. - Who the hell are you? - Arjun, please! - I said... I said go! - Arjun! - Arjun, Arjun... I can't live without you. - Get out! - Move! Get out of my house! - Please! Arjun, please... - Listen! I cannot live without you, Arjun. - I said, get out of my house. - Arjun, please, don't leave me. - Just get out! Arjun, Arjun, I beg you. Arjun! Arjun! You...! Arjun! Open the door! The time has come to fill the last page that has been blank for long. Roy, Colonel Vikram, arkat-Ul... They are all suspects we know. In the whole investigation, there is one person we didn't suspect. Uff... I will get some water. You want? Oh! I didn't come to disturb your privacy. Once you leave, we don't know when we will meet again. That's why... I came to speak to you once. But... don't forget to lock the door next time. Especially, when you have close friends who walk in without ringing the bell, you got to be more careful. Aryan! Aryan, listen to me. Aryan, listen to me once. Aryan, I just need one second. I said one second. Not interested. For what I saw with my own eyes, I don't need anyone's explanation. It's your life. But had you valued our friendship and told me earlier, I wouldn't have mistaken you. Is this why you sacrificed the gallantry award for me? Aryan! Say one more word, and I don't know what I will do. Just suppressive sexual demeanor. Rude behavior with people. Third degree torture on criminals. Just a trace of your bloody brutal nature, Arjun. - What? - Hey! - What's your problem, man? - Wait. Fools like me... think you do your duty like a man because there is no girl in your life. Hey, get lost, man! Aryan, leave him! I said... I said leave! I said... why fight with him? Huh? Sorry, Aryan. Whatever you did till now hiding this truth, I will do what I should in two days. Aryan... Aryan, Aryan! Aryan, please! Listen to me. Arjun, stop him, man! Stop him! Oh, my god! Oh, my god, oh my god! Arjun, stop him, Arjun. He is leaving, Arjun. Arjun, please do something about it. Arjun, if you don't stop him, he will be a big problem for both of us. Are you listening to me, Arjun? Didn't you hear what he said before leaving? He said he would tell everyone about what he saw. You know what that means? He is threatening you, Arjun. He is threatening you. He is threatening both of us. He is going to ruin, man. He is going to ruin both of us. Arjun! Oh, my god, he is so dangerous, Arjun. Something has to be done, Arjun. Do something, Arjun. Please. Just because you guys are friends, don't think he is not going to hurt you, man. Arjun, if this comes out, I don't even know how to face society, Arjun. Arjun, I am not ready to come out of the closet. Neither are you and you know it. If my family comes to know, they will shun me, Arjun. I cannot bear it, Arjun. I cannot survive this. We cannot survive this. Please, try to understand, Arjun. Arjun, please, Arjun. Stop drinking, Arjun. Do something about it, man! And stop drinking, man! Please! May be he will listen to you. Try talking to him once. At least pick up the goddamned phone. Talk to him, man! Arjun! Please! Don't be coward and stop him before it is too late, Arjun. Come on, Arjun. You are a bloody ACP. Tomorrow's news will be all about you. The officers who salute you everyday will mock you as gay officer from tomorrow. Do you want it? Society will shun you. Can you face it? You cannot. If he opens his mouth, your life will never be normal again, Arjun. Both our lives will never be normal. At least... at least... consider your friend, Mohan. If this comes out, how it affects everyone's behavior towards him, you can't even imagine, man! It's going to be devastating for everyone, Arjun. Especially for his wife, Githa. How can she bear when she hears of this? She will question your relationship with Mohan. Can you imagine how sick that would be? You don't care about yourself. At least think about me. Think about my family. My parents cannot take it, Arjun. They will commit suicide, Arjun. If something happens to them, I can't live with it. I am out of time, man. I will commit suicide too. I will kill myself, man. This can't be happening. You can't do this to all of us. You have to stop that person before he ruins our lives, Arjun. He didn't answer the phone, no matter how many times you called. Since he didn't respond at all, we understood he was up to something. As he was not taking your calls, you made me call him. What's your problem, man? If you speak about this... I will. I will surely talk about it. What are you going to do? Not anywhere else. I will speak about it in public. What will you do? - Er... Arjun wants to talk to you once. - Hang up! What is he up to? Yesterday, he said he would do something in two days. Today he says he will go public about it. Oh, my god! It's the Gallantry Award event tomorrow. Everyone will be present there including public. If he opens his mouth there, we will be dead, man. Arjun, we don't have time. Do something, Arjun. I am not a good police officer. I don't even know how to be a good police officer. At such time, a friend walked into my life. Everyone says I get boring after two days. But this friend tolerated me along with my flaws and remained my friend. I can call him anytime. However big a problem I am in, he will come for me. Even this award... it is his sacrifice. And for the fact, I killed no terrorists. I don't even have the brilliance to do it. I don't want him to be one of the friends I would end up losing. I want his friendship life-long. The most valuable thing in my life is the time I spent with him. That will always... stay here. Arjun! My friend! My brother! Please, come on to the stage. This is yours. You deserve this, man. Aryan trusted no one the way he trusted you. Not even me. I am showing this to you because you are Aryan's friend. But please... Don't reveal this video under any circumstances. I don't want anyone to think less of him. Everybody thinks this case will never be solved. If it were another police officer, I would think the same. But... Arjun is dealing with this case. Aryan's close friend. Please, find the culprit. I trust you. This is the least you can do for Aryan. Mohan, the case is solved. I am not a good police officer. I don't even know how to be a good police officer. I found out who killed Aryan. Aryan was killed by... Me. Aryan, who wanted to tell the world greatly about me, ...was killed by me. I am the bloody killer. After my parents passed, I lived like an orphan for 15 years. No family. No friends. Just emptiness. So much emptiness even tears desert you when you cry. Loneliness. I didn't want to get back to that life, Mohan. And... I didn't want to lose you. Though you accept me, the society around won't. Nor that what we share is friendship. When I opened my eyes in the hospital, I didn't even know who you were or what you were to me. Same with Aryan. But now, both of you are my unforgettable friends. I'll miss you both. What you did was an incorrigible mistake, Arjun. But as a friend, and considering your present state of mind, I can save you from the case. Truth. We may escape God. We can't escape truth, Mohan. Arjun, who tried to hide a truth, touched death but escaped. If you want to hide that truth now, this Arjun dies every day throughout life. I want to live, Mohan. I want to live even after my death. I don't want to be Arjun A. I am happy to die as Arjun B. Reporting Assistant Commissioner of Police Aryan's murder case... ACP Arjun is the murderer. We have all the evidence. Prepare for his arrest. I deserve to be punished, Mohan. I, Arjun Prasad, I deserve to be punished. ...while being faithful to my country and to the Constitution of India as by law established, I will protect the sovereignty and integrity of my country and carry out the duties of my office loyally, honestly and with impartiality. I solemnly promise to this effect.
