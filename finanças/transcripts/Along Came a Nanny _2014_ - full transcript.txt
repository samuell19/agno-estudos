There's the mayor. Let's see what she has to say this time. Sixth robbery in two months? Imagine if this wasn't a "safe and sound" community. I promise you, mayor danielson, we're doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Do you know what? My nanny could've cracked this case faster. Well, maybe we should put her on the force. Do you know how embarrassing this is? I live here! Every day, I have to reassure my neighbors the police are "this close" to finding the perpetrator. And now this. Poor jim donahoe in the i.c.u. with severe head trauma. Well, at least his wife was out of town, escaped injury. Gotta be grateful for that. : I am. But when people start getting hurt, that's a line in the sand, and you know that. You also know what a tough re-election campaign I'm fighting, getting tougher by the robbery. Captain milano, I want... ...need you to escalate this case. Whatever it takes. And I'm talking yesterday. First, a reminder that our good buddy and colleague, griff hoolahan, will be retiring next week after 37 outstanding years of service. 37 years! That's amazing! Griff's exit opens up the new lead slot on the poplar point investigation, which, due to the increase in violence, is now the number-one priority for mayor danielson and this department. Losing griff also opens up a level-two position here in robbery. In plain english... a promotion. What're you looking at, logan? The only upgrade you'll be getting is on a rent-a-car. Rosario? Captain, I'm about wrapped up on the third street case, so... And just let me say, great work, detective. Thank you, sir. As a result, I could jump right into poplar point. If you agree. - Sir. - : What a kiss-up. Did you say something, detective? Oh, just, um... how terrific it is for the precinct that detective ramos so capably closed in on third street, sir. She looks good, we look good. Detective ramos, see me in my office in five minutes. The rest of you, back to work. How do you like that? They got this great new invention... It's called "knocking." I gotta be on poplar point. Not a chance. Give me one good reason. I can give you six! One for each robbery, plus a victim still in i.c.u. is he gonna make it? Ah, it's touch-and-go. Last report, he was still unconscious. - Ouch! - Exactly. Do you know what the mayor said to me today? Her nanny could've solved the case faster. Double ouch. I don't think she even has a nanny. That's it! I gotta go undercover. As a nanny. "Manny." whatever. To get in there and infiltrate poplar point. Well, hoolahan's already ruled out an inside job. All due respect, hoolahan has had one foot out the door for, like, months on... What you need is somebody that's hungry and committed to bust through this. That's why I'm putting ramos on it. I do like the undercover nanny bit. It's inventive. I know! I thought of it! Well, even a broken clock is right twice a day, logan. - Now, if you'll just... - no. Captain, you're not... You're not hearing me. I thought of this. This is my idea, my case. I deserve this. Ramos deserves it for cracking third street! Frankly, logan, you're just a little too... - Inventive? - Impulsive! You can't just jump in half-baked. Not with the mayor breathing down our necks. Your neck, which is exactly what I'm trying to help save here. Okay. What do you know about kids? Aside from how to avoid having any of your own. I am just waiting for miss right, and I know plenty about kids. I grew up with four younger brothers and sisters. I helped my parents out with them, like, all the time! I just need a little brush-up on the basics, and I will be... ...good to go. That's ramos. Captain, I want this! I want to protect that neighborhood. I want to put that thief behind bars. I want to get the mayor back on our team! There's an employment agency that fronts us on cases like this. They'll put you in their system... and we'll go from there. You will not regret this. Ramos. I love the vest. Okay... "always utilize currencies important to your child to incentify appropriate behavior." Makes sense. "Never utilize currencies important to your child to incentify appropriate behavior." "Don't overestimate your child's apparent problem." "Don't underestimate your child's apparent problem." Or... just flip a coin. Iogan! Just heard from the employment agency. You're in luck. Couple from poplar point, pair of lawyers, just lost their nanny. They need a new one a.s.a.p. -: Later, calvin. Later. And they're okay with a male nanny? Well, the last one was a woman, and that didn't work out, so, yeah, they're open, and they have a son, so a "manny" could be a plus. What happened with their last nanny? How would I know? Just go and meet these people tomorrow morning first thing, make 'em like you. Tall order, I know. Hoolahan's notes on the case. Oh! Don't forget these. Keys? For what? Your new vehicle. Our treat. The chicks are gonna love this. Well, at least I'll have an excuse for being dateless. What's yours? Best "manny" ever! Who are you? Hi! I'm mike. Who are you? I'm not allowed to talk to strangers. You could be the robber. Well, I promise, I'm not the robber. Is your mommy or daddy home? Ava, I told you... No opening the door by yourself. You must be mike. Hi. Lizzie bannerman. Hi. Sorry. We've all been a little on-edge since the robberies. Well, I'm here to serve and protect. Figuratively speaking. Please, come on in. And I apologize in advance for the mess. I need you to finish your breakfast and get ready for school. No. Yeah... no. It's, uh... agnes edwards. Yes. Lethbridge, minnesota. No, don't go in there. ...i'll talk to you in a few minutes. Okay. Bye-bye. - Here you go. - Okay, thanks, babe. Alright. Yeah. No. I got that, too. Hi. Kevin bannerman. Uh, listen, I am crazy late for court, but lizzie'll talk to you. Thanks for stopping by. Alright. Alright, kids, we gotta hurry. Bus is gonna be here in two minutes. Mommy, I don't like my pigtails. Mom, my stomach hurts. I should probably stay home. Ava, your pigtails look fantastic. Iucas, honey, you can't have a stomach ache every day. When you get to school, if you still don't feel well, just give me a call and then... No, I'm gonna be in depositions all day long. Call mike here, and... What's your number? Do I have the job? The agency did their background checks, said you were the best, so, yeah. : Okay. It's okay. Did my pancakes die? Okay, that's okay, honey. Just grab a scone. Chester... Chester! Step away from the pancakes! Let's just give it a try, shall we? Okay, guys. Let's go. Let's go. We're gonna just... oh, gosh. Um... I'm sorry, mike, but could I ask you to tidy up around here a little bit? Your mess is, uh, is my mess. I got it covered. Thanks a million. Our cellphone numbers are on the fridge, and... whew. We'll see you later. Don't forget... Doors locked at all times. Got it. Okay. Alright, guys! Let's go. Have a great day, bannermans! Really? Hello! Hello, ladies. Hi. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm mike logan, I'm the bannermans' new nanny... "manny." Or whatever. Just happy to be on board. And you are? Mariah kingsley. "miss" mariah kingsley. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you... - Miss mariah kingsley. - Gloria mueller. Been a nanny longer than you've been alive. Longer than most people have been alive. And the third musketeer is? Jessie white. I work for the warners across the street. Oh! Great. We're neighbors. Nice to meet you. Warmin' up for something big? Just getting my steps in. 12,000 today, that's almost 6 miles. Wow, that's very ambitious. You must be in great shape. What do you do for exercise, mike? Besides working out your pick-up lines? I will race you any day, jessie. Okay. So, I guess it's been a little bit scary here lately, right? With all the break-ins? What's scary is they didn't catch the son-of-a-gun after the first five robberies. Now violence. Loser cops. There's more chance one of us could catch the guy. You guys seen anything or anyone, you know, weird? You know, come to think of it, there was that strange guy hanging around lately. We should probably look out for him. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah. He's about 6'2", brown hair, blue eyes. Drives a red van, calls himself "mike." Just a little new-nanny humor. - Ahh! - Good luck, mike! Thanks. - Wait up! - Keep up! That's a lot of pink. Chester, chester... off! Bad dog. Ioretta's head fell off. Can you sew it back on, please? You want me to sew? Like, now? Okay-okay-okay-okay! I'll sew. I'll sew. Ahh! Did you hurt loretta? Ow! No, ava, loretta is just fine. Kids, the bus just drove away. Didn't you hear the horn? This guy hasn't even made breakfast. Or lunch. Ohh! Uh, it's, uh... Getting there. Well, this is... interesting. That is a work in progress. Oh! Sorry about that. And don't worry about the bus, I will... I will take the kids to school. In that mary poppins-mobile? No way! Oh, my gosh, I love mary poppins. ♪ Chim-chiminey chim-chiminey ♪ ♪ chim-chim-cher-oo morning, troops. Hey, shouldn't you guys be on the bus? Mike messed up. But he's driving us so he doesn't get fired. Kids! Yeah. Lucas? What say me and you shoot some basketball this weekend, huh? Get you ready for tryouts? Basketball? Really? Because you're looking at one of the sport's secret weapons, right here. Well, maybe you should coach lucas. You know? He really wants to be on the team. No, I don't. Basketball's stupid. Okay, let's just get to school. We can argue about sports later. Oh! Mike. Can you cook up a tofu stir-fry for dinner? Everything you need's in the fridge. You got it. Thank you. - Okay. - Yeah. Bye, kids! This... is pathetic. See? On time after all. Just like the bus. Only because the bus driver makes, like, a million stops. You drive like an old lady. Hey... "lucas puke-us." Don't even think about joining basketball. Loser. Everything okay here, bud? Yeah... great. See ya. Morning. Hi! Hi. Jessie, right? Yeah. Uh... is that... do you... do you have peanut butter in your hair? Oh... yeah, this is, uh... very good conditioner. You should try it sometime. : Bye! - Bye! - Bye, guys. Bye. You, uh, missed the bus, too, this morning? Yeah, slight breakfast malfunction. Those two are pretty close. Yeah, yeah. They are playdate pals. You know, they're neighbors, so it's easy. Oh. Are the neighbors all pretty close? Yeah. Some. Some are. You know, some keep to themselves. Honestly, a lot of people have clammed up since the robberies. Hey, we should get the girls together for a playdate after school today, maybe go to the park or something. I can't. That's baby's nap time. The baby? They baby's a baby! He can sleep anywhere. Uh, it's a she, and I'm pretty sure that even you know that that is not true. Besides, I... I've got to study. Oh? Study for what? I'm getting my master's degree in child psychology. Okay, that's scary. Why? You worried you're gonna be my first client? No. I mean, how do you possibly find time to go to school with... ...all this? Well, I take classes online, so that helps. And besides, you know what they say... If you want something done, just ask a busy person to do it. Exactly! Which is why a super-multitasker like yourself should be able to squeeze in a little playdate. You knit, too? What don't you do? It's, uh, it's not knitting, it's crocheting. I love it. Totally relaxes me. I'm making a blanket a blanket for carly. Oh, very cool. Lucky baby. So, where did you work before poplar point? Downtown. I mean, for a family that used to live downtown. One of those fancy lofts. But they moved. Far away. To canada. But I didn't. You know. Move. How long you been with the warners? Oh, coming up on a year. In august. Yeah, I adore mrs. Warner. She's a... she's a great mom. Mm-hmm. And mr. Warner? He's a good dad. He's a workaholic. You know the "tires on the go" stores? Those are his. Whoa! He must do pretty well. Hey, what did you mean earlier, when you said everyone's "clammed up" since the robberies? Just that people are looking over their shoulders more. Do they think that someone around poplar point is the burglar? Maybe. Yeah. Although I heard that the police don't think so. Do you think so? If I had to guess? Yeah. Don't listen to me, though. I'm just an amateur sleuth at heart. Really? Me too. Especially the "amateur" part. Ha-hah! Can I have a juice box? A juice box? Uh... mike, where's your stuff? My stuff? Yeah. All your kid stuff. I really want a juice box! : I got one. Okay. - There you go. - There's your juice box. Want one? Can you open it? Yeah. The straw goes in the little hole on top. Worst nanny ever. There's a little hole right there. There's a lot of pressure in these things. My last kids, they were... They were a little bit... They were a little bit older, they were past the whole juice box thing. You're a weird nanny, you know that? Okay. Wanna play "princess"? Yeah! Just give me a few minutes, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Whoa. Purple is not your friend. Shh, shh, shh! I'm playing with the kid, man. Calvin, you are such a life-saver. You better get down with the cooking thing, bro, or you are toast. No pun intended. I know. I'm on it. Just a lot going on. : Mike! Come on! I'll be right there! Yeah? What are you finding out? Aside from how to grant wishes? That I got to get these people to start talking, but first, they got to eat. Thanks again, man. Classic. Mike! That looks gorgeous. Just a little something I whipped up. Although I don't remember leaving you peppercorns to add in. What is that? Black bean sauce? Yeah, I just, uh... put my own little personal spin on it. Mm. Don't wait for me, though. Please, everybody, dig in. Mike and I played "princess" today. You did? Wow! Mike, did you know that ava wants to play the princess in the class production... - ...of sleeping beauty? - What? Could you help me rehearse for it? Absolutely! As long as I have time to practice b-ball with the luke-man. Would you let it go? Nope. Ava's gonna be in the play, and you are gonna make the basketball team. Now eat your tofu. This is great, mike. It's as good as they make at panda kitchen. Well, that's the last of 'em. I could've got those. Please, you're doing enough around here. Besides, I still have three hours of case work to finish tonight, so I'm kind of stalling. Do you like being a lawyer? I like the law. I like bringing the guilty to justice. Exactly! I mean... So you must have some idea of who's breaking in around here. Not really. But if I've learned one thing as a lawyer, it's that most answers are hiding right in plain sight. Which can also make them the hardest to see. Hmm. Oh. That reminds me... Be sure to set the alarm anytime you leave the house. Something tells me this burglar isn't finished with poplar point. Honestly? I've even taken pictures of all my jewelry, just in case. I promise, the alarm will be set at all times. I'm gonna hold you to that. 'Kay. ...gets a juice box from me, can't open the thing, looks at it like he's never seen one before... What? He's fumbling with it, it's going everywhere... Oh, he's coming up right now. Don't stop talking on my account. We were talking about you. Aww! I'm flattered. Don't be. I was telling them about your battle with the juice box. Yeah, well, I can't be good at everything. What are you good at? Well, I can play the song "chopsticks" with chopsticks. I think I'd rather see you open a box of juice. Yeah, me too. - Well, bring it on. - Alright. I'm serious! Alright, me too. 10 seconds. Go. 10 seconds? I got this. This is easy. Has the clock started? This is... this is... This is fixed! Go, mikey. Go, mikey! Tick-tock. This is the tricky part! - Come on! - Time's ticking. Who's your daddy? Okay, it's a juice box, it's not the super bowl. - See you later, jess. - Bye, guys. Hey, mr. Warner! You home for lunch? Nah, I forgot some contracts this morning. Stopped by to grab them, and to put up this game-changer. Hey, carly! You're voting for that guy and not your neighbor? "That guy" just happens to be an old fraternity brother of mine and a mighty fine candidate. And, uh, who are you? This is mike logan. He just started working for the bannermans. Paul warner. Sorry. Matt, was it? Mike. "Mike." logan. Well, welcome to poplar point, mike. You're gonna like it here. Except for the robberies, I guess. Yeah. Yeah, messy business. Jim donahoe's still in the i.c.u. might be days before he wakes up. If he wakes up. Look, I know I'm the new guy here, but we should probably tell each other if we see anything strange, don't you think? Sure. Forewarned is forearmed. Hey, don't forget, vote mcnamara. Bye! I should go. Meanwhile, you should work on your juice box technique. I still got you beat by six seconds. Six seconds? : That's it for today. Thank you. Hey, princess. Your highness. Oh, sweet. Now get your royal highness to my office, would ya? The boy, lucas, has that moody-cynical thing going on, but I think it stems from a lack of self-confidence. Ava, the six-year-old warmed up to me pretty quickly, even though she's stuck playing princess with me. - Iogan, the robberies. - Right... What are you finding out about the robberies? Sure. Um... well, as you can imagine, the whole thing has spooked the residents. I mean, a lot of people still think that the perp is an insider. Of course, they do. Okay, what else? Well, mostly, I've been working on the nannies, trying to get them to open up. Especially this one nanny across the street, jessie. Could she be a suspect? What? No. No! I mean... I can't imagine that she would be. Why? Are you into this jessie? It's not like that, sir. And I thought you already questioned the nannies. I'm asking you, mr. It's-not-like-that. Well, in reality, anybody over the age of 10 could be a suspect. And if the campaign signs are any indication, mayor danielson is not making any new friends over there. The robberies are killing her numbers. Check this out. She dropped, what, five points in the last week alone. Think this mcnamara's any good? Well, he's got a decent rep, a fair businessman, lots of charity work, good family. Who knows? Okay, logan. Keep on it. We'll, uh, nail this crook. Well, that's all. Go bake brownies or... do laundry, whatever it is you nannies do. - Bye! - Bye. Hey, guys! I'm hungry. I put some snacks out in the kitchen. Go help yourself. 'Kay. So what do you think? Bought it this morning at the sporting goods store. What part of "I'm not interested" don't you get? None of it. I know you want this. Okay, let's do it. Alright, luke-man, let's see what you've got. Okay! Alright. That's a good start. Alright, I want you to try it again, but this time, I want you to square up to the hoop. Okay? That means both your feet should be pointing right at the rim. Just like that, and it's so important to bend the knees a little bit. Yeah, get a little comfortable there. When your hands are on the ball, your fingers should be nice and wide like that, and it's one smooth motion up, and I want you to follow through right to the hoop. Kinda like that. Now you try. Okay? So much better! But it didn't go in. But your form was way better! And you see how much closer you got? I mean, do you think kobe and lebron aced it their very first time? Yeah, I do. Alright. Try it again. You're doin' great. You're doin' great. That was great! Very close. Follow through. Follow through right to the hoop. Believe you can do it. You've gotta believe it. Right on target! You see what I mean? That's what I'm talking about! Bend the knees. Follow through. Okay, now you're just showing off! Yeah. And you will too. Real soon. Hey, uh, kids? Maybe you should head in and finish your homework, okay? Alright? Iuke-man, awesome job today. I mean it. I mean it! Great job. - Dean... - hey! Jessie! - Hi. - Hi. Mike, this is... This is dean bartons. He works for mr. Warner, at "tires on the go." This is mike. He works across the street. Oh, yeah? Is he, uh, a nanny? Yeah. Lucky man. You get to see this pretty lady all the time. Yeah. I also get to see how hard she works. Which is exactly why I keep telling her, she needs to get out and have a little fun. Let me guess. With you? Hey! Hey, jessie, we... We got to get going. We're gonna be, uh, we're gonna be late for that thing... You know, the, uh... the, uh, the "nanny-palooza." The nanny-palooza! I... I totally would've forgotten about that. Listen, dean, uh, thanks for stopping by. I'll see you around. Count on it. "Nanny-palooza?" I don't know. Thanks for that. Well, he's very persistent, isn't he? Well, you can't fault a guy for trying, right? But dating him would be, what, like a conflict of interest? 'Cause he works for your boss, or...? So what's for dinner, mike? A mess, probably. Well, when in doubt, go with spaghetti. It's fool-proof. That's a good boy. That's a good boy. How're you doing? Hi! Hi. I don't think we've met. I'm mike, I'm the bannermans' new nanny. Renee donahoe. Hello there, "mike." I'm sorry about your husband. But I-I hear he's doing much better. Seems that way. And that's soon-to-be "ex-husband." Oh, I... I didn't know, but I just moved in, so... then you probably also don't know that your boss is jim's divorce lawyer. My boss? Mr. bannerman? Uh-huh. You're right, I did not know that. So, uh... should we be talking? As long as that's all we do, there's probably no harm. You're for mcnamara, I see? In a big way, yeah. My husband's for danielson, of course, but that's just one more thing we disagree on. See you again, neighbor. - Hey! - Hey. What's going on? Just taking chester here for a walk. Listen, thank you for yesterday, the whole "nanny-palooza" thing. Always glad to help a damsel in distress. Or potential distress. That is a lot of diapers. Well, a good nanny never runs out of diapers. And here I thought it was patience. That is a close second. Hmm. So other than diaper-duty, you busy right now? No. Mrs. warner has the baby, so I'm just out and about. Why? Wanna go grab a coffee? Swap recipes? So tell me, what does "mike the manny" really want to be doing? What do you mean? I'm doing it. Come on. A guy like you? This is just a pit stop. This isn't the final destination. Like take me. I love children. I love being a nanny, but I want to do something to really make a difference in their lives, really help them. And you will. No question. Me? I just... i just go with the flow. And so, what about... What about relationships? You ever been married? Come close? I was engaged once, long time ago. It was a total impulse move, would've been a disaster. But we realized it and we broke it off. Pretty much ever since then, it's been me, my work, and i. With the occasional "her." By the way, no one ever told me, why did the bannermans' nanny quit? Cookie? Oh, she didn't quit. She was fired. Fired? For what? Ineptitude mostly. I mean, she was sweet, she was friends with all the nannies, but she was a bit of a mess... kind of flaky. And possibly was skimming off the top of the expense account. Cookie had her hand in the cookie jar, huh? Well, mariah was really good friends with her, and she swears that it was just a rumor. And then dean and cookie are second cousins, which is kind of weird, but anyway, dean's known her his whole life and he promises that she would never steal anything. Listen. Thanks for, um, getting me out like this. This was nice. It was, wasn't it? Oh, no! It's mariah's house. Gloria, what happened? Mariah's people left for vacation this morning, so she's out doing chores, and bang! Somebody breaks in. She's talking to the police right now. I'm gonna check it out. Maybe you guys should just wait here. Alright, miss kingsley, if we have any more questions, we'll be in touch. Be careful, mikey. Your place could be next. "Mikey?" She's a fan, what can I say? Yeah, well, your "fan" remembers setting the alarm before she left, but can't swear to it, which I'd say sounds convenient, except, frankly, I've done the same thing myself. Still, it points to somebody who knows this place, or, again, at least knows the alarm code. I say get inside that house. Bring the nanny a pie or whatever, nose around, see what stinks. Maybe I'll bring her some of this special meat loaf that I'm making tonight. It's turkey loaf. The bannermans don't eat any red meat or anything like... I don't care if they eat rocks, "mikey," just find me the perp. I'm on it, sir. Okay... dig in! I don't know whether to eat it or dribble it. Well, I made it in your honor, luke-man. Keep up the great hoop work. Can you make one in the shape of sleeping beauty? That's a little bit of a tall order, but I can do my best. And don't forget, we need to rehearse later for your audition. Yeah. Thank you. Tell me the truth... You're bionic. It's the only possible way you could have that much energy. What? Sorry. I, uh, I couldn't hear you. I was listening to an audio textbook. For class. Like I said, bionic. Listen. Since I have you here, do you have a minute? I have 10, then I have to help ava with her sleeping beauty audition. Nice! Do you remember how we said we should tell each other if we saw anything strange? I found it really strange and out of the ordinary. And you say you saw him standing right outside of mariah's house? I drove right past him, right after I ran into you. I didn't think anything of it until we got back from the park and, well, the robbery. Maybe he was a gardener, or... an exterminator? No. I doubt it. Gardeners are monday, wednesday, fridays. Pest control is every other tuesday. Today's thursday. Cable guy? The u.p.s. man? Oh. Wearing sweat pants and a baseball cap? But you only saw him from behind? Honestly, I can't even be sure that it was even a him. It happened so fast, but whoever it was had on a backpack. One of those camouflage ones. Do you think I should call the police? I have another idea. I appreciate you coming out this early, but... you know you don't really need to be incognito. We're just kinda nosing around a little bit. Just playing "detective," I know, I know. I mean, it is kind of risky. The police are still investigating. They're nowhere on this, so maybe we can help. Just us. You know, "on the q.t." And don't worry, I'll protect you. It's kind of exciting. It's like "turner and hooch," only we're both humans. I loved that movie! Here we are... "scene of the crime." Do you remember where "backpack" was standing? Yeah, he was right here, in the driveway. Hmm. Let's go. Come on. The family can't get back till tomorrow, but I told them "don't rush. It's not like anyone's gonna break in again." Well, how can you be sure? They never hit the same place twice. Besides, all the big stuff is gone. Stands to reason. Doesn't it? Yeah, those fools knew just where to look and just what to take. What window did they come in and out of? Now, how did you know that? That it was the same window? He's seen a lot of cop shows. Ever seen "turner & hooch"? Hmm. That one over there. Okay. Next, you two are gonna say I robbed this place. Why would we say that? I don't know. That's how rumors get started. How cookie lost her job, and, let's face it, handsome, how you got yours. Mariah, you're being paranoid. Cookie lost her job because she was a crummy nanny. Girl had her issues, but she was no thief. Hand over that prize-winning meat loaf I keep hearing so much about. Right? Yeah, but you have to admit, when it comes to made-up detectives, nobody beats sherlock holmes. : Hiya, jess! Ugh. What's he doing here? Hi! I was just going to leave these for you at the door. A little something to brighten your day. Yeah. Wow. Mike, right? Yeah. How goes it, sport? I should probably get back to the shop, but... enjoy, okay? - Talk real soon. - Thanks. What girl doesn't like flowers? Mm. But the note can make or break the whole thing. He says, from experience. You know what's better than flowers? Chemistry. I should get her inside. Yeah. Okay. We can play "sherlock holmes" again real soon. Okay, you got it. - Bye! - Bye. Mike! Mike! I had a great audition! That is so fantastic, ava! And I did just what you told me to, I pretended I was sleeping beauty, and I showed them how I'd sleep. I was so good! Don't sell any tickets just yet. There were a lot of kids auditioning. But lucas and I are both crossing our fingers for you! - Me too! - Alright! Hey, will you take chester inside for me? - Okay! - Okay. What? Who put sugar in your gas tank? What's that supposed to mean? It means, you wanna talk about it? Not talking about it won't make it go away. If brody calls me "lucas puke-us" one more time, I'm gonna lose it. No. Don't lose it. Okay? But do stand up for yourself. You tell him you want him to stop right now. Okay? Trust me. The biggest bullies are also the biggest babies. So... what are we waiting for? : What? Nothin' but net! Whoo! You nailed it! Alright. Let's keep it up. Getting a jump on the morning? Anything to get the kids out on time, you know? Now, if you could just help me get out on time. I heard mr. Donahoe's out of his coma. That's, uh, that's good news. That's great news. He's actually coming home this weekend. Oh! Well, mrs. Donahoe must be very relieved. Renee? I think she's probably rooting for an early demise. Uh, the donahoes are going through a divorce. I'm jim's attorney, so... i guess I'm a little biased. Is that weird for you? Defending a neighbor? No. No, not really. I mean... jim and I have never really been that close, and anyway, it was his idea. Mm. So, what? He just came knocking on the door, looking for a lawyer? It was fluky, actually. Uh, cookie, our ex-nanny, she had a cousin who used to work for jim and... Cousin? Dean? The guy who works for mr. Warner, at "tires on the go?" I don't know, cookie never mentioned. Uh, anyway, he mentioned to her that, uh, he had an ex-boss that was going through a divorce, and cookie says, "wow, small world. My boss handles divorces," and jim came knocking. He probably thought I'd give him a neighborly discount. I did not. Well, good luck on the case, I guess. Thanks. Don't, uh, don't work too late. Has anybody seen cookie since she worked for the bannermans? Mariah said that she went to work for the mcnamara campaign. I mean, she probably put up half of these signs. Why do you ask? Just wondering. You think cookie is the poplar point thief? Come on! Don't kid yourself, jessie. We're all suspects. She might've stolen a little bit of money from the bannermans, but she's no criminal mastermind. How can you be so sure? Elementary, my dear watson. Hey, carly. How are you, sweet girl? What? Nothing. Just... thinking what an excellent mom you'll make. Alright, let's get back to the real investigating, huh? Thanks. - Hiya! - Hi. Did you come to volunteer? Well, I was just passing by, and I wanted to see what all the excitement was about. Well! It is about a mayor who can protect his citizens, and has a terrific new business and development plan. Sold. Great! Pen? - Oh! - Oh. Oh! Ow. I'm so sorry. That's better. I'm a little bit of a klutz. No, you're not, you're just someone who obviously has a lot of responsibilities. Thank you. I wish my last employer saw it that way. Hmm. What were you doing before you were a, uh... campaign superwoman? I... I was a nanny. Not a very good one, I'm afraid. It got complicated. Life is complicated. So what brought you here? My cousin knows gil. Actually, knows somebody who knows gil, old college buddy or something. But here I am, "outreach coordinator." What do you say? You wanna join? We could use loads of help. I'm gonna think about it, but I will take you up on the button. Sure thing. - Ooh! - Oh! Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry. Again. Why don't I put that on myself? - Good idea! - Okay. I hope to see you around, uh...? Calvin. Cookie. Cookie. - Okay. Great. Bye. - Bye. It was renee donahoe. I saw them. Are you sure it was mcnamara? Like he just jumped right off of one of his campaign posters. Wouldn't mayor danielson like to know that juicy little tidbit about her "happily married" opponent. He'd probably just deny it and play the "I'll keep you safe" card. I mean, if he'd cheat on his wife, he'd cheat on bellingham, and he'd probably cheat to become mayor. I don't know, but if they don't catch this burglar soon, it's gonna be "hello, mayor mcnamara." Well, all the more reason to keep playing detective. - Am not! - Are too! I am not! : Hey! Whoa... what's going on, guys? Emma called me a bank robber. I'm not a bank robber! I'm not an anything-robber. Emma? Why in the world would you call ava a "bank robber?" Not bank robber, "bankrobbed!" That's what my dad told my mom they are, 'cause they have no money. Do you have any money? See? Then you're bank-robbed. Just like me. The word's "bankrupt," stupid. Okay! Um... hey, girls? Why don't you go feed the ducks, okay? Yeah! Yeah! - We'll be there soon. - Let's go! What was that? The warners don't know that I know this, but I overheard paul telling mrs. Warner that he filed chapter 11 for "tires on the go." He said that they were bleeding cash, and, evidently, emma knows, too. No wonder he's been so preoccupied. I just keep waiting for them to tell me that they can't afford to keep me on anymore. Then I guess that would mean the cat's out of the bag. Might soon be anyway. Hopefully not. Poplar point is all about perception. Especially when your neighbors are also your clients. Exactly. So can we just...? : Well, according to these internal records, "tires on the go" is in a whole lot of quicksand. Warner's in big trouble. Which includes keeping up appearances, which takes money. From somewhere. You sound like he's robbing his neighbors. Do you really think that mr. Tires-on-the-go is sneaking around poplar point with a pistol and a ski mask? Or maybe somebody's doing it for him. Later, pal. So I'm driving, and I'm sitting there, literally, thinking about what I'm gonna cook for dinner, and then I hit the pothole, and... Tire blew. Happens. A lot. Lucky for us. How's business? Well, we're hanging in there. Can't always be christmas, right? Tire's in stock. Autograph there and there, and we'll get that tire changed out for you as soon as we can. Hey! Nanny matt. What brings you to my humble establishment? It's "mike," pete... paul. "Mr. warner." Had a fight with a pothole. And you lost, obviously. Well, we'll fix you right up, won't we, dean? Absolutely, boss. You be careful. Okay, guy? How's that gig working out for you? You know, the nanny thing. It's good. It's really good. It's hard, but very rewarding. Like getting to spend all your time with jessie? You like her, don't you? You don't? Yeah, I do, but we kinda work together. And you work for her boss, so... so you don't think that I should date her? I think that's pretty much up to jessie, don't you? What can I say? I'm an optimist. Anyways, why don't you go grab a seat, and we'll get that minivan of yours all changed up in about 20 minutes. Hey! Let me guess... You're here because you heard I was experimenting with mariah's chili recipe, and you want a preview, right? Listen. I got a strange phone call from dean. Did you go by the tire store today? Yeah. Did you tell him he shouldn't go out with me? What? No! No. I mean... I may have mentioned that his work might get in the way, but, look, look... Who you go out with is absolutely none of my business, and if you like this guy, then... go for it. Really. Mike, you want to protect people, and that's... That's great, really, but I don't need any protection from anybody. Okay? I'm a big girl. Yeah. Sure, okay. I'm sorry. I hope the chili's a hit. I'll see you later. Ava... what is it? What's wrong? They gave the part to tara goldfarb! Said I could "understudy." I don't want to study! I want to act! I'm so sorry. You should be! Your advice was stupid! They didn't care how sleeping beauty actually sleeps. Well, I mean, that was the only part of the whole... Holy moly. How did you get the black eye? By standing up for myself. Only brody stood up bigger, faster... - and stronger. - Are you okay? Do I look okay? Truthfully? You look like one tough dude that I would never mess with. You're a jerk, nanny mike. Can anyone guess the shape of tonight's meat loaf? It was a map of the united states. By the way, uh, ava, you're about to eat florida. Just saying. You know what we should do? Just for fun... learn sleeping beauty's lines anyway. Just like you got the part. I'll help you out. Hey, luke-man, I got an idea. After school tomorrow, we should head down to the college, and practice a little bit on a real regulation-size court. Why don't you keep your ideas... - ...to yourself? - Lucas. - Hey! - You're being rude. Okay, you guys, have an awesome day at school today. When you get home, we're gonna do something super-fun! : Okay... rough morning? I have officially lost my superman status with ava and lucas. The nanny game can be brutal. Mm. Hey, I'm sorry about the other day. I really didn't mean to make you mad. I should get going. Want some company? I promise to keep up. Sure. Okay. I'll go lock up. You get started and I'll catch up. Look, mike, I like you. You seem like a really good guy. But... Ahh! The dreaded "but." But anything more is just too close for comfort. You know? We'd have no privacy. People would talk, it could get in the way of our work, and... And, not that I was even asking, but let's just say that I was. Are you saying that you wanna play it safe rather than take a chance on the unknown? What kind of detective does that? Not a very committed one, I'm afraid. I'm sorry, mike. Chester, please tell me you did this? Captain? Iogan. Bad news. I'll leave that... there. Well... goodbye. Even if it is your fault we were robbed, I don't think it's your fault I wasn't picked for the show. I was just trying to help. You didn't. But that's okay. I'm sorry I called you a jerk. I have been called way worse, believe me. I believe you. And I'm still gonna try out for the team next week. Iucas, that's great! Remember, square up, bend those knees... follow through. Kids, can you give your dad and me a minute to speak with mike? Thanks. Mike... lucas's black eye... we understand that, you know, these things happen, but... how, after I specifically asked you to set the alarm whenever you leave the house, could you forget? That's just it, I didn't. I did not forget the alarm. I'm sure of it. I'm... Pretty sure. Well, either way, a beat was missed on your watch, and our home was invaded. What if the kids had been home? But I mean, they weren't. Isn't that what's most important? We hate this, we really do, mike... but you've lost our trust. That's what's most important. Well, um... say goodbye to the kids for me. - Of course. - We will. You can't take me off this case! I have a ton of leads, I'm zeroing in on a suspect, and I finally have the trust of the people of the neighborhood! Yeah... until your family's house, of all possible houses, was robbed. I'm sending in rosario. What? That wet blanket? She is not gonna last one day at the bannermans. Maybe a day is all she'll need. Frank, please, at least let me keep working it from here. I can't. I've already reassigned you. Have fun. "Pet psychic" fraud? What am I, in "detective jail?" That's all, logan. - Hey! - Hi. Been looking for ya. Yeah? You have a minute to talk? Sure. I got you something. You like it? Um, wow, dean, it's gorgeous. I can't take this. It's too expensive. Just think of it as a special gift for a special woman. Go on, try it on. Jess, just... give me a chance. You won't be disappointed. I promise. I just hope jessie doesn't end up dating dean. She deserves a lot better. Like, oh, I don't know, you? He shouldn't have ratted me out like that. He totally twisted my words around. Not cool. It's simple. He pegged you as the competition, and wanted you out of the picture. In fact, bannermans getting robbed, you getting fired... Perfect timing for that dude. Couldn't have worked out better if he'd planned it himself. Seriously? Bankruptcy can make strange bedfellows. What if dean is doing warner's dirty work? Mike... I really think you've gotta let this one go. Yeah, okay. You're right. Mm-hmm. Besides, I, uh, I've got a fake pet psychic to apprehend. Nice try, lucas. "Nice try" doesn't get you on the team. Are you any good? Well, I played a little in high school, but... You're worse than I ever was. Just a little rusty, that's all. I guess that means you can't help me practice my lay-up. Maybe you should ask your father. I'll never make the team. Wanna play "princess"? How do you do that? I don't know! You just do. Nanny mike knew how, and he was a man. Obviously, a very versatile man. I'll play sleeping beauty and you can play the ugly sister. I have work to do. At least we know you're not the poplar point thief. What does that mean? Robbery number nine just went down. See ya. Wait! I'll go with you. No, you won't. You're not a cop, remember? Not at poplar point. I'll go in disguise! No one will know. I can help. You already went there in disguise for three weeks, and helped no one. I was at the park, come home, and we're robbed. Have you noticed anyone new or unusual in the area in the last few days? No. Nothing. At all. : We're taking this very seriously at city hall. We have the police working 24 hours a day. This is something we will not stand for in our community or our city. We are going to use any resource available to us. : Driving under the influence, bad checks, couple petty thefts... pretty good hunch after all. Now we just gotta get milano to listen. : Once the prints come back from the lab, we'll know for sure. Get back to the bannermans and keep in touch... what are you doing? My job. ...leading up to... Logan, we're in the middle of something. You need to run this for prints. A pen? A "tires on the go" pen. It's a bit of a long shot, but I think it's connected to the robberies. The robberies you're no longer on. Fine. You know what? You give it to the captain. If it works, you can take all the credit. Just, please, do it. Hey... how are lucas and ava? Delightful. Good. Captain! What are you doing here? Needed to talk to you in person, in private. Okay. Sure, come on in. Sorry about the mess. Ah, that's okay, I've seen your desk. I'll stand. Pizza? Iogan, just listen to me. We ran that pen you gave us. A print showed up. A partial match with one from today's robbery, and some others we have on file. Dean bartons's? You gonna bring him in? I would if I could. Can't, 'cause he's gone. Vanished. Wow. Did you question warner? Or jessie? Jessie probably knows where he is... No. That's your job. Wait, what are you saying? Nanny mike is back in business. You're returning to the bannermans. Really? What about ramos? Long story short... They hated her, missed you, want you back. Tomorrow morning, first thing. The agency told the bannermans you're starting a new nanny job, but will stay until they find someone else. Uh... is that pepperoni? Yes, it is. Go ahead. Just so you know, I'm still going for that promotion. Just so you know, you can have it. I'm here to crack a case and to watch out for a family. Nanny mike! You're back! Hey! Aww... that lady was such a loser. I had to teach her how to play basketball. She wouldn't play "princess" with me. And her meat loaf looked like pooh. : Will you come to my tryouts later? Yeah! You got it, man. And my play after? Wait! You're in the play? The school just called. Tara goldfarb got the chicken pox. What? But what about all the dialogue? I did what you said, I pretended I got the part and I learned all the lines. All by myself! I'm gonna be a star! Not if you don't get to school on time. : Alright, guys! Go, go, go! - See you later! - Bye! Hey, luke-man! Remember, you got this! I know! You know why? You. We overreacted after the robbery. We are so sorry, mike. Forgive us? Absolutely. Welcome back, mike. Great to be back. We're late, as usual. There's your key. We'll meet you tonight at the kids' events. Meanwhile, the kitchen is a total disaster... No worries. I got it. Thank you. - Thanks, buddy. - Have a great day! - Bye, babe. Love you. - Bye. You too. Chester! Hey, buddy. Stay right here. I'll be right back. Okay? I'll be right back. Hey-hey, mr. Warner. Well, look who's back on the block. Yeah, you look like you're in a bit of a hurry. Yeah, it's a madhouse at work today. See you later, matt. Uh, it's mike, actually. Is jessie at home? Jessie? Nah, I haven't seen her all morning. She's probably out buying diapers or something. "A good nanny never runs out of diapers." Yeah. Well, she's gone, my wife's with the baby, I'm running late... That's all I know. A "madhouse" at work, huh? Yeah, right. - Oh! - Miss me? What do you think? It was great to have a "manny" around! Oh! Thank you. Hey, have you guys seen jessie recently? Not since the break-in at gloria's. Maybe she ran off with that dean. Yeah. With dean? What are you talking about? Well, boy gave her a fancy bracelet. I would've said yes. What kind of bracelet? Twisty gold thing, with little diamonds. - Must've cost a pretty penny. - Yeah. He didn't snatch it outta some box of cracker jacks, that's for sure. : Yeah. I bet he didn't. What a guy. Anyway, I've got a house to clean, so I'll, um, I'll see you guys later. - Okay. - Sure. Yeah. It's logan. Listen. Meet me at "tires on the go," and bring back-up. Matt. What are you doing here? For crying out loud. It's "mike." Where's dean? That's what I'd like to know. Today, of all days, he's a no-show. You're lying. I know he's here. What are you talking about? And who are you to call me a liar? You're just a nanny. Is that right? And what's that? This is exactly what it looks like. And I know you hired dean to rob poplar point to get you through bankruptcy. So where is he? And where are you both holding jessie? Jessie? I already told you, I haven't seen her. W-What's this all about? Oh. Ahh. Okay. Yes. My company is currently under chapter 11, and if you really must know, yeah, I'm broke, but I don't know any more about these robberies than, frankly, it seems that you do. What have you been doing this whole time, anyway? Playing "undercover nanny?" Mike, mike. You don't have to do this. Alright? I may not be the nicest guy in the world, but I've never cheated anyone, ever. Maybe if I had cheated, I wouldn't be going to bankruptcy court. Don't you ever say that anyone "is just a nanny" ever again. You got that? Nothing here, guys. Let's move on. Iogan, what the heck is going on? I think I'm onto something. Just follow me. : Okay, let's go! Let's go! Mcnamara headquarters? What is this, logan? You can fire me if I'm wrong. I can fire you if you're right. Fine. You ready to catch this guy or not? Calvin, hold back and follow logan's lead. You other guys, just hang out here. Okay. Thanks. Calvin! Welcome back. Did you come to volunteer? That's great! We're super-swamped and we can... Where's dean bartons? What? Who's dean bartons? Your cousin. I don't have a cousin dean. I do have an uncle named don, but he lives in spain, so that's prob... Calvin, who are these people? Mike... why is she calling you calvin? Cookie, please direct us to dean bartons and gil mcnamara or we will arrest you on suspicion of the poplar point burglaries. So that's a "no" on volunteering, then? You got 10 seconds, ma'am. Okay. Follow me into our warehouse. Excuse me. Excuse me. Go ahead. They're up there. Keep an eye on her. - Hey, grab her! - Stop her! It's locked! Your star witness just locked us in. - You're killin' me, logan. - Check upstairs! Okay, help me. It's me, cookie! Open up! Don't ask any questions. Just get her out of there. Now. We're locked in. It won't budge. Hey! Cookie, I can't believe that you're a part of this. Mike? m... Cover the back! Everybody out of the van! Get out! Out, out! Everyone! Let's go! - Everyone out! - Let's go! - Let's go! - Okay, okay. Come on, get over there! Get over! Mike? What are you doing here? Yeah, that's what I'd like to know! Captain frank milano, 19th precinct. Let's unhandcuff this lady. Sir. Yes, sir. Mike, why are you with the police? I've been working undercover as a nanny, to help solve the robberies. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. What? You're a cop? A detective, yeah. - A real one. - I knew it! I knew that there was something wrong with this guy! Great, now how about telling us what's been going on here? Allow me. Captain, this is all about politics. Mcnamara was down in the polls, and so he needed to cook up some kind of scandal to sabotage mayor danielson. What better way to do that than a string of robberies right in her very own backyard, to show that the mayor couldn't even protect her neighbors? And through his old buddy, paul warner, mcnamara found the perfect guy to do the actual stealing, dean bartons. You are way out of line, pal. Meanwhile, dean here's so sadly trying to get jessie out on a date, for, like, forever, decided to bribe her for a date with a fancy gold bracelet... - Is that the one? - That's the one. The bracelet that he took from the bannermans when he robbed the place a couple days ago. I didn't rob anyone! And that bracelet was not a bribe. Oh, give it up, you liar. I went over to dean's the other night, to return the bracelet. I told him that a gift like that didn't feel right, like it didn't feel right to go out with him. It's too much. It doesn't feel right. And then before I knew it, he accusing me of accusing him of stealing it. What doesn't feel right? I mean, you're acting like I stole the bracelet or something. : So I finally said, "well, did you?" - What'd he say? - Nothing. He just glared at me like he was gonna take my head off, and that's when I saw it. It was the camouflage backpack. I tried to run, I tried to scream, but be was too fast, he pulled me inside, he locked the door. Dean obviously called mcnamara and told him that jessie was onto them and took her to campaign headquarters, panicked, locked her in the winnebago until they could figure out what to do with her. That's abduction, by the way. I'm curious... How did you bypass all the home alarms? Cookie? You want to take this one? When I started at the bannermans', I had awful credit card debt. Like, scary awful, and I mentioned it to dean... Your cousin. Oh. Step-cousin. Well, he told me that he would pay off my credit cards if I could get him some information that he needed to, well... work his way into a few houses. I was so desperate, so... So she befriended the nannies. She would walk us home, for coffee, chitchat... while secretly memorizing the security codes on the alarm systems. She even found made her way into the donahoes', while skimming money from the bannermans, making copies of their keys. Wow. Jessie, you are good. Yeah, something like that. : I mean, I could go on, captain. Like about your affair with renee donahoe... Okay. That's enough. Good work... sergeant logan. Hey-hey-hey! Drop it! Just drop your guns! - And let me go! - Dean! Put them down. Down, down! What are you doing? Take it easy! You got him? Jessie, you okay? Yeah. - You sure? - Yeah. Let's get these crooks to the station. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. You saved my life. You weren't doing so bad yourself right there! What, do you take self-defense classes, too? Just every other saturday. Of course you do. I am... I am really, really sorry that you had to go through all this. Looks like I needed your protection after all. Thank you, sarge. I didn't want to lie to you. I really didn't. I was just... I was just doing my job. Well, listen, you seem like a really good cop. Almost as good a cop as you are a nanny. Well, you know, I am a pretty big stud with a juice box, thanks to you. Hey! I gotta... I gotta go! The kids' events are, like, happening right now. Um... you wanna come with me? I mean, it'll be fun. Uh, yeah, after 15 hours of that, I'm in, it sounds fun. Great. Great, and then maybe later, we could just go out for a nice, romantic dinner, no kids, no cops, no robbers, just... just us. Just us? I like the sound of that. Let's go.
