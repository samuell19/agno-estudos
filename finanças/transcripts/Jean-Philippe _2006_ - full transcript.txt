The report is on the desk What time is the meeting? 9h30 Edith, please. Can I have a coffee? Hi How are you Fabrice? Colleague 1: Did the meeting go well? Fabrice: Champagne, debauchery... classic. Colleague 1: Tell me, I talked to Michel about your autograph Fabrice: You want to see it? Michel: Yes show me You're lucky Michel: "For Fabrice, friendships. Johnny" is it real? Of course. Michel: Well I have a friend in the bank looking after large clients and it seems that Johnny signs his real name: Jean-Philippe Smet I need to see. Go to the bank and speak to my friend. Colleague 2: Hi Guys Colleague 1: Ah, a little coffee. "Tomato Soup" Colleague 1: Oh! Sorry. Colleague 2: You guys are really stupid. Fabrice: Johnny wouldn't do such a thing. Hi. Oh! Hi! It's me. You could say good evening. Laura: Hi Fabrice: How are you? Babette: Hmm Babette: The bank called. Babette: They bounced a check Fabrice: I'll call them. Babette: We were in agreement. You can't afford a vacation in St Tropez. Fabrice: We can have fun. Babette: I have wanted to go to Italy for 10 years, But you prefer to go to St Tropez. And rent a villa next to Johnny's. The villa is for you too. For me? You forget my birthday not his. Choose. It's him or me. There are days, I want to screw everything up. Don't say that. My job bores me, my wife is jealous of Johnny and I have an autistic punk daughter. I really failed in life. I should have been an actor, I did theater when I was younger. I had comedic potential. It doesn't look like it. Yes Yes. I believed in it, I had it. And I got married, I had to find a real job. Have you ever wanted to come back? Yes, but I had to feed my wife and my punk daughter. Luckily there's Johnny. It is he who gives me the strength to live. And there are thousands of us. We could raise an army. What would we do without him? Fabrice: Have a good evening, thank you. ♪Johnny's song♪ ♪...♪ ♪I sing it when I sing it♪ ♪And I will always sing it♪ ♪A long time ago on guitars.♪ ♪Black hands gave birth to him♪ ♪To sing sorrows and hopes♪ ♪To sing God and then love♪ ♪Music will live♪ ♪As long as the blues live♪ Man: Shut up! ♪The blues means...♪ Man: Oh!

It's not by chance the name of your bowling alley is name "The Olympia" You have always dreamed of being there. Fabrice: Alright, I know it's crazy, but you can listen to me 2 min.

I exchange the 10 parts, against 2 min of your time, I have something very important to tell to you. You have 1 min, I'm sleepy. I come from a parallel world, and I know things about you that you don't. Is it my birthday or what? Where I come from you are a huge singing star, for 40 years you have sold millions of albums. What should I answer? I don't know, you should be happy. Jean-Philippe: Happy? But of what? I'm not a huge singing star. And I wouldn't have this house. It is bigger than mine. Alright, I'm going to sleep, so should you. Good night. You were born on June 15, 1943 in Paris. You were raised by your aunt, Hélène Mar, a singer. In the early 50s, you take dance lessons and you learn the guitar. In 1954, you made an appearance in "Les Diaboliques" by Clouzot. In 1957, when seeing "Loving you" with Elvis Presley, you decide to become a rock singer. On December 30, 59, by participating in the TV show "Paris Cocktail" you are discovered by Jacques Wolfsong which will produce your first record. There are 4 tracks: "Loving you madly", "Oh Oh Baby" "Leave the girls", "I was crazy". Jean-Philippe: All of this is a long time ago. I would give a lot to relive this period. It was the beginning of rock in France. I was hanging out with my gang. During the fights, our concern was not to damage our clothes. Clothes were important. We were all dressed up like James Dean, like Marlon Brando. We had the full package. and we were going to flirt with the girls at Golf Drouot. Fabrice: located at the corner of Montmartre and Drouot. Jean-Philippe: Yes, that's it. It was there that I started to sing. Fabrice: Yes, Lee Hallyday, your cousin, gave you a guitar. Jean-Philippe: Yes indeed. And at this time, I recorded a demo of several titles. Fabrice: 5 tracks exactly, recorded on a friend's tape recorder, in June 1959. Jean-Philippe: Do you want to tell the story for me? Fabrice: Sorry. Anyway, that's in the past. Fabrice: If everything I say is true, what went wrong? Not everything happened as you described. I did not participate in the show "Paris Cocktail" I had a Vespa accident on my way there. No more breaks. Fabrice: So that's it. Not participating in the show, you were not discovered by Jacques Wolfsong who therefore never produced your first record. In any case, there is someone who can say thank you. Who is it? He called himself Chris Summer, he was the one who replaced me on the show. This pretentious little prick thought he was tough because he had been fired from church choir. Pathetic! And when he changed, the brat became Chris Summer. And you never tried your luck again? I was immobilized for several months. Afterwards, it was too late, There were too many of us in rock. So I did something else: A bar in the 60s, a sex shop in the 70s, in 82, a video club: the "Las Vegas Video". And then I built the Olympia. One thing is sure, I've never been a star, I never sold a record. Who were you with? No one. So turn off the light. Yes good night. Good night. Pffft, what are you doing? I have an idea. Oh, you're annoying. What are you doing? I'm going to my father. Again? Why? I found this. How's that for you? It's nothing, it's bullshit. Stop! Don't leave this stuff lying around. But that's bullshit. Listen, you know I love you. No, I don't know exactly. Caroline! It's not true! You spent the night here or what? I thought about it. I need to talk to you. Not this morning, I don't have time. It's important, please. Are you going to tell me that I missed out on a football career? I want to be your manager. I want to make you who you should be. Oh no! You still have these crazy eyes. Johnny sleeps in you, we can make up for lost time. It's been 40 years since it's too late. No, it's never too late to fulfill your destiny. Yours is to be Johnny, to sing for others. Bullshit, I have other worries. And that's bullshit? Jean-Philippe: What is that? Fabrice: As a fan, I know your songs by heart. There are 967. I wrote about 50 from memory. Jean-Philippe: From memory, yes. I take one at random, in 1976: "Requiem for a fool" Taken from the album "Behind love". Johnny speaks directly to the public!

Babette: Yes I met him in the subway, He played the guitar, he has talent. Would you give up your job for a stranger you met in the subway? Do you know you have a family? Right now, I don't understand you. Fabrice: You never understood me very well, Babette. How old is he? He is 60 years old. What? 60 years? Yes 60 years old. When you go see this guy, 60 years old, it's inconceivable that 60 means that. 60 years old means nothing to him. He is 15 years old, 10 years old, 200 years old, 500 years old. He has no age, he is the quintessence. You will see. As long as you don't give up on your work! Babette: What does it sound like? Fabrice: Like Johnny Like Johnny... It's him. Fabrice: Jean-Philippe.

He's the boss. Jean-Philippe: So you're a punk? Marion: Yeah, like. Jean-Philippe: It suits you very well. Marion: Thank you. Well, the first thing, change the look of Jean-Philippe.

Hello, I am the husband of Babette, the mistress of the kindergarden class. Fabrice: Do you know where she is? Teacher: Go see in his class. The kindergarden show was this morning. They seem to like the songs, your kids. Yes. Madam, think carefully. It will be perfect for children. Like Henri IV, Jeanne D'Arc or De Gaulle, Johnny is part of the history of France. You understand? Ah Babette, I was explaining that children should know Johnny. Babette: It's not possible. Fabrice: Babette! I will call you. Babette, Babette. Babette, wait for me. Babette: Everywhere, you have to bring her back, with your obsessive delusions. Fabrice: I came to get you to invite you to the restaurant. I hadn't planned... Babette: Leave that poor guy alone, you're giving him false hopes. Fabrice: What did you say? Johnny a poor guy? When you looked at him, you didn't take him for a poor guy. Babette: You're right, you're the poor guy in the story. Fabrice: You'll see, we're going to go very far with Johnny. Babette: So long! That's it, they answer. "The New Idol" ♪(Chris Summer Song)♪ Jean-Philippe: What is it a casting for? Fabrice: "The New Idol", a "Little Fan School" but for adults. Jean-Philippe: Say "Hello" to "Originality"... Fabrice: Wait, do you know who is the guest on the next show? Jean-Philippe: I don't know. Fabrice: Chris Summer. Jean-Philippe: Really, he's everywhere. Fabrice: We do not care. What is important is what you earn. Singing with Chris Summer in duet at the Stade de France. Jean-Philippe: I am not excited. Fabrice: How are you not excited? You're not excited but are you crazy? There's nothing to think about, your big comeback to the Stade de France. Thousands of fans in a trance, listening to you. Stop, don't you think you're doing too much?

Yes, down the hall on the left. I will be back. Man: You're gonna see Chris, it's gonna be a great show. Chris: There's still a lot of work to do. Chris: Johnny. Johnny Hallyday. Hi Chris. How are you? I heard your name just now. What happened to you after so many years? Man: Mr. Summer, we're expecting you. Chris: I'm talking, can't you see? Excuse me, I have to get ready. Chris: After 40 years of preparation, you can stay an extra 2 minutes. Chris: By the way, your scooter accident, did you ever know why there were more brakes? What are you telling me? (Sound of a fight and screams) It's okay, outside. Outside! Reminds me of when you used to do street theatre, when passers-by took you for a madman, you came home covered in bruises. Fabrice: Do you remember that? Babette: Yes. Ouch it burns Babette: Where? Fabrice: Here. Babette: There is nothing. Fabrice: Look, it burns... Fabrice: No, not the morning TV! It will make you stupid *This singer will have the privilege of singing a duet with Chris Summer *September 22, at the Stade de France. *Tony Loman is the champion of France of karaoke in 2003, *So a duet with Chris Summer at the Stade de France? *Yes, a duo in front of 80,000 people.

Wow, you hid that from me! Jean-Philippe: Why are you here? Fabrice: I have an idea. Jean-Philippe: I fear the worst. Chris Summer, his concert I know how to do. You know you're annoying? I'm serious, I have a plan. Look, we lost. Here is Chris Summer the idol. Johnny Hallyday is no one. Why do you say that? If you hadn't freaked out, you would have won the contest. Jean-Philippe: What do you know? I know because I'm your biggest fan. You're not going to tell me that you don't believe it? You are not motivated? Is that it? Say it right away. Because I have other things to do with my life. Jean-Philippe: Yes and what? Do you realize that I'm impersonating a stranger? And no one cares. If you believe in yourself, people will believe in you. It's not complicated. You are Johnny! You're Johnny, God damn it! Jean-Philippe: No it's not me. Not in this life, and it's the only one I know. Before you, I wasn't a super star, but I knew who I was. It's pitiful, look at your models. Johnny would see you, he would be ashamed. Johnny, fuck him. At least he collects the real ones. Here Mom. Caroline: Can you get me the last box? Laurent: No problem. I come to help you. This is the one, I believe. Show me. I think so.
