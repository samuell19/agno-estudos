Rosa, I saw Saint Sebastian. He said a miracle will save the worId. Many people were following all singing and praying. Nobody believes me. But I saw him! He looked deep into my eyes. It's a miracle, Rosa, a miracle. Rosa, on Saturday I'll go to market. Divide the cattle with Moraes. Maybe I can sell two cows... and buy a piece of land from him. If it works out we can plant something... to harvest next year. It's no use. I don't know, we've got to try. Heaven might send us a miracle. Yes, Rosa, maybe there'll be a miracle. -Morning, Boss. -Good Morning. The cows are here, but four of them are dead. Did they drink water from the North well? Yes sir, it was the onIy place. They were bitten by snakes. I brought twelve cows. Maybe we could split the loss. There's nothing to split, the dead cows were all yours. But Mr. Moraes the cows had your brand on them. They couldn't be mine. I'm a poor man. It was an accident, but it's true. The snakes bit your cows. Don't argue! The law is on my side. Excuse me, Mr. Moraes but what law? -Are you arguing with me? -No, sir. But what's this law which doesn't protect what's mine? I've already told you , you're entitled to nothing. But Mr. Moraes... -You can't take what's mine. -Are you calling me a thief? You yourself are doing so! My son, your mother is dead. not by God's hand. By a mercenary's gun during... a fight in the backlands. I knew it, Rosa. You didn't believe me... but it was the hand of God led me to the Devil. We'll have to go to Monte Santo... and ask for St. Sebastian's protection. Come on now... we've nothing to take with us but our destiny. Was Don Pedro AIvares Cabral discovered Brazil. He had his cavalry built of stone and blood. This pilgrimage to Monte Santo... will open the gates of Heaven... to the bodies and souls of the innocent. I have walked from village to village... telling everyone fire will sprout from the rocks... to burn the worId. The lords of this land... the authorities and the farmers... they all said I was Iying... and that the sun would be to blame for this disaster. Last year I said we'd have 1 00 days without rain... and we had them! Now I tell you... On the other side of this holy mountain... there is a bountiful land. The horses eat flowers. Children drink milk out of the rivers. And rocks turn into bread. Dust becomes flour. There's water and food, the abundance of Heaven. And every day when the sun rises... Jesus Christ and the Virgin can be seen... and Saint George. And my Saint Sebastian... his chest bristling with arrows. We must show the authorities... the power and force of the Saint. They removed Dom Pedro from his throne, and now try to kill those who love the Emperor. But those who wish to save their souls... must follow me from now on... until the day when God's sign appears in the sky. A hundred angels with their swords of fire, shall come to herald our departure, and open our way through the darkness of the backlands. The land will become the sea and the sea the land. A man shouldn't be another man's slave. He must leave the land that doesn't belong to him, so that he can reach the fields of Heaven. The poor will be rich... and will sit on the right side of God. The rich will be poor and stand on the left side of the Devil. We shall not be alone, because the Lord has sent down warring angel, to cut out the heads of our enemies. I'm condemned but have courage. I give my strength to my Saint so he can free my people. The Lord be praised. Do you stilI remember me? I don't remember anything. Neither the night nor the day. We lived together. Back on the farm. We've been here in Monte Santo for a long time. You're following Sebastian and you left me behind. I have to be alone to reach the Sacred Island. I must leave behind wife and children. We'll stay one year in Monte Santo... waiting for the rain of gold. Then we'll go to an island in the middle of the sea... and we'll let the fire from the sky burn this... Republic of disgrace, once and for all. The Island doesn't exist. We have it inside our souls. If it doesn't exist... why must we search for it all our lives? You have come to be my strength in peace and war. You must fight for me. The Island doesn't exist. Yes it does. I saw it at the bottom of the river. Sebastian said the island doesn't exist... and that we must live in pain. I was behind you. I heard. You're Iying. You and all the others are faithless and damned... but I'm going to survive and be king. My cattle will graze in a green pasture. That's a dream. The earth is dry and will never bear any fruit. Why must you be sick with hope? Let us leave this place and make a living elsewhere... before the Army arrives... and does the same as they did in Canudos... killing men, women and children. If there is a war... I'll fight a thousand soldiers with Saint George's spear. If the people of Santo die, I'll create the island. You shall die. I shall die. No one will escape. Fate is greater than death. There's gold in the sea beyond. Rocks turn into bread, and horses eat flowers. You walk in the dark. Lost in this dry worId Under no God or Devil There goes Antonio das Mortes The killer of the 'cangaceiro' highwaymen. Since Sebastian came, the church has earned nothing... from christenings and weddings. Sebastian is dangerous to both farmers... and the church. The Government doesn't help us. I always said we have two laws here: The Government law, and the law of the bullet. I never won an election through votes. If the strong don't unite, they'll destroy everything. To kill a 'cangaceiro' is dangerous, but it's easy. We all remember Canudos. The troops came to fight Conselheiro. We all thought it'd be child's play... and look what happened. We mustn't let Sebastian become another Conselheiro. Personally, I'm not afraid of wars. I've always lived with them. But you know it's dangerous to interfere in holy matters. Sebastian is a nenemy of the church. But the people around him are Christians. I haven't seen for myself... but apparentIy he can work miracles. Well now. OnIy you can do it. We'll give you 300 contos to rid us of the beatified. Christ drove moneylenders out of His temple with a whip. The example is in the Gospel. So, Antonio? Do you accept? 300 Contos. It's a lot of money. It's a small price to pay to get into Hell. The priest thinks Sebastian has a pact with the devil. But I think he has a pact with God, too. Then you must leave here. Buy a farm, and live in peace for the rest of your life. This is your penitence, Antonio. It is onIy when you commit a great crime... that you may be forgiven for the crimes you committed. 600 contos. That's twice what they offered you before. Tell them they can live in peace. Sebastian is finished. From here I can see the sea, and then the Promised Land. God separated the earth from the sky. But he was wrong. When I put them back together... the island will be visible to all. There will be happiness, Rosa. After the backlands, the sea! You must choose. Go down there. Bring your wife and a child. OnIy after Rosa's soul is washed, will you be clean. To govern the island, to govern the island. My wife has the devil in her! Tomorrow golden rain will fall. The land will become the sea... and the sea will become the land! When we get to the island... we'll clean the souls of the sinners... with the blood of the innocent. Godfather Sebastian! Killer of 'cangaceiros'. Good morning, blind man. I am Antonio das Mortes. They all died happy. They were praying. I didn't want to kill them, but I had to. I spared just two, to tell the tale. And Sebastian? They killed him. The people killed the Saint! On the mount of Monte Santo OnIy Manoel survived By the mercy of Antonio The killer of 'cangaceiros' Our story continues Now, people, pay attention Manoel and Rosa wandered Through the backlands And one day they came upon Into their lives came Corisco The devil Lampi?o. I kept my promise to Father Cicero. I won't let the poor starve to death! In the name of Lampi?o... I'll avenge the walking and the dead. It's my Saint George, Rosa. Forget all that, I can't stand seeing you... suffering any longer. It's been 3 days, that's a long time... for someone fighting a war. Maria Bonita's body is rotting. Worms are eating her lovely eyes. Maria is dead but Lampi?o is alive. His flesh is no more but his spirit is stilI living. His spirit is inside me, joined together with mine. I am a two-headed 'cangaceiro'. One on the outside, the other on the inside. One is the killer... the other is the thinker. We'll see whether a two-headed 'cangaceiro'... can change these backlands. The dragon of evil swallows the people... to fatten the Republic. But I borrowed Saint George's spear to slay the evil giant. Here! Here's my rifle to save the poor from starving. Who are you stranger? I'm a follower of Sebastian. Where is Sebastian? Antonio das Mortes killed him. Filthy Republic! They killed Sebastian and Lampi?o! They killed our protector! Captain Corisco! May the Lord be with you! Drive out the devils from your body. Who is this stranger? Drive out the devils, and go in peace. Where is the priest of Monte Santo? Antonio das Mortes wiped out the holy people. OnIy two were spared. The others died a long time ago. Dead? All dead, a long time ago. I was so far away that I wasn't aware of anything. And how about Lampi?o? Don't you know? He was killed three days ago. With Maria Bonita and his followers. No one can imagine what it was like. My soul is filled with sorrow. This pain grows like the sun. And we must stay and remember. It happened at six o'clock in the afternoon, at Angico. He was killed at the mouth of the night. And Maria Bonita at the break of the dawn. Are there any soldier nearby? I am waiting for the signal. I had a dream. Today we shall die! Die? How? You are crazy! When all was lost! I saw the Devil's rifle fired twice, once in each eye. In your eye, Lampi?o! Stand aside, who would dare shoot me in the eye? My body is protected by the Saints. But I saw the sign. Death is coming today at sunrise. Here in our hideout? OnIy if you did it, if you betray me I'll kill you. The others, there, the ones who live with the Devil. I'm going away. My time hasn't come yet. It is your turn. Let's go men! Maria! Avoredo! Gavi?o! Let's move. I cut off eleven heads at the traitor's farm. Then I put them in a bag... and sent them as a gift to the police... with a note written in blood. It was my way of showing them I'm at war to avenge Lampi?o's. But my men were frightened and walked out on me. Now I am alone... with those two. Those two against a thousand soldiers. A thousand soldiers. Captain Corisco. I want to join your gang. I could help this war. I've nothing to do. I want to avenge Sebastian's death. The Government and the landowners killed him. Can you fight? Yes, sir, I can fight. I've done plenty of raids. And I can ride, I used to drive cattle. Saint George is helping me. I need a valiant man. A man like myself. You look strong. What's your name? Manoel. That's a cowherd's name. I'll give you another one. From now on, your name is... Satan! Now let's get on with our war against the Government. See? See your bride? Now she's gonna be a 'cangaceiro's' wife. Satan! Show you're a brave man. Cut out this cuckold's manhood. Leave this war, let's go away. It's now or never! Where can I go? I have to stay, to avenge my sorrow... and do justice. I'll kill him, Rosa. Get up, you coward! KilI me, captain, kill me. What did you expect when you ran away from home? Justice! Sebastian promised. And wasn't I justice? I thought so. But can't we compIy with the law without shedding blood? When I was young... I was chased and beaten like a dog by that man's father. I have waited twenty years. I've beheaded people to relieve my woes. It's no use now. My fate is so smeared... that all the blood in the worId couldn't purge it. You are like the angels. If I die, go away with your woman... and spread the word that Corisco... is more dead than alive. Lampi?o is dead, and I died with him. That's why I must stay standing... fighting to the very end. Disrupting order. Until the land turns into the sea And the sea into the land Wandering with remorse Antonio das Mortes Comes looking night and day Corisco of Saint George Comes looking night and day Corisco of Saint George Comes looking night and day Who are you? Have you forgotten my voice? Antonio das Mortes I've been tracking you for over a week. I just wanted to ask you: Where is the man I spared in Monte Santo? The cowherd who killed Moraes. Remember? Yes, sir. Haven't heard of him in a long time. People saw him fighting alongside Corisco last week. Tell me the truth: isn't that cowherd the same one they call Satan? And wasn't it you led him to Corisco? I think destiny turned out well. I couldn't drag Manoel and Rosa along with me the whole time. The destiny of a 'cangaceiro'! Antonio, do you see clearIy ahead of you? I see the vast backlands of Canudos. In these backlands, I can see the blood of Conselheiro's. They all died fighting the Army. in the gloom of my blindness. I can't understand why you hunt Corisco. No one questions me! I must fulfill my destiny. Without a thought nor pity. Blind man Julio, tell me, who killed the saint at the church? You can't ask such questions, one forgets such things. Who killed him? Was it Manoel? Didn't you say the people did it? I lied. I couldn't believe it. It was the hand ofjealousy. Rosa killed Manoel's faith. They're both doomed. I'll kill them one way or another. Corisco's very tired. Don't kill Corisco either. I'll kill him. I'll hunt him down to the end. Is killing your way of loving your neighbor, Antonio? Sebastian asked me that, too. I didn't want to do it, but I had to. I didn't slaughter those people for money. I killed them because I can have no peace with this misery. It's not the people's fault, Antonio! Some day a greater war will burn these backlands. A great war without the fear of God or the Devil. Maybe that war will start soon. I who killed Sebastian will kill Corisco. And then I'll kill myself. Because we are of the same blood. Antonio das Mortes is close by and told me to warn you. Do you hear that, Corisco? He's near. Let's leave! I can onIy find peace in death... in Heaven, surrounded by angels. Listen, Corisco, whoever dies is finished! Antonio himself said your head will roll on the ground. The Saints protect me. I'm waiting for Antonio das Mortes, to fight man to man... as God would against the Devil. Corisco faces the powerful dragon. If I die, another will be born... for no one can slay Saint George, the Saint of the people. And I'll die for you, captain. Weren't Sebastian and Lampi?o the same? That's blasphemy. Don't blaspheme! Sebastian was greater than Lampi?o. Don't you dare compare them or I'll kill you. Anthing more to say? I'm not afraid. We had been defeated at Razo de Catarina. I carried Lampi?o on my back. Ezequiel! Levino! Antonio! All your brothers are dead, Lampi?o. Of your race, you alone are stilI alive. The souls of your friends are wandering alone. I broke everything and nothing has appeared. Nor ever will! After I kill the others, I'll kill myself. We onIy find that kind of peace in death. I have my doubts about death, Corisco. We wandered day and night... until we found Sebastian... alone and hungry. Without his sword... he was following Jesus Christ's example. He helped Lampi?o. He tended his wounds. He wanted him to stop thieving, so he wouldn't die. Lampi?o asked for Father Cicero's protection. You know what Sebastian answered? That Father Cicero was an enemy of God. That he was God! He wanted to take Lampi?o's weapons from him... and place a cross in his hands instead. Have some respect, bastard priest! Lampi?o struck, spit and kicked his face. A man is a man when he uses his gun to change his fate. Not a cross, Satan. A dagger or a rifle! Lies! Lies! Lies! I always told you you had the wrong image of Sebastian. Lampi?o was great but at times he was small. That's a lie! I'm afraid of dreaming of... all the lead I shot at good and bad men. I am afraid of Hell! I am afraid of the souls of the victims of my dagger. I am afraid of being sad. Of being alone like a cow lost in the desert. I am afraid, Corisco. I am afraid of the darkness of death. It's true. Dad?, go with the blindman and fetch our daughter. Satan! Go alone to see how many soldiers... are with Antonio das Mortes. They've killed our daughter. They said she had to redeem our sins. There's no way out. The soldiers are blocking all the roads. To Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe. Antonio has all of us surrounded. He said he'll send our heads to the President. Sabi?! Macambira! Go now. You can keep the gold. I'll face Antonio das Mortes alone. Satan! Are you going or staying? It's always been against your will. Now decide. I am too close to you now, to live. If we get away... we're going to have a child. Yes, a child! I, Jos?, shall be protected by Abraham's sword. I, Jos?, shall be annointed... with the milk of the Virgin Mary. I, Jos?, shall be baptized with the blood of Christ. I, Jos?, shall find shelter in Noah's Ark. I, Jos?, shall be locked by Saint Peter's keys. Where no one will see me, won't hurt nor kill me. Neither shall the blood of my body be taken from me. Give yourself up, Corisco! Greater power to the people!
