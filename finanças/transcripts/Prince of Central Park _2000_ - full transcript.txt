CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY TRIMARK HOME VIDEO JJ: SEE, I COME DOWN HERE ALMOST EVERY DAY AND WATCH THE FERRY COME IN. PEOPLE PILE ON AND THEN IT LEAVES AGAIN BACK TO THE BIG ISLAND. IT MAKES THE TRIP TO MANHATTAN EVERY HOUR OR SO EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK... BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN ON IT. NOW, MOST PEOPLE OUT ON THE STREETS, THEY HEAR BUSES AND TRUCKS AND CAR HORNS AND STUFF, PEOPLE YELLING AT EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME, AND IT'S ALL MIXED UP LIKE SOME KIND OF CRAZY TUNE. TO ME, THE STREET IS MUSIC. I HEAR MUSIC ALL THE TIME. I CAN HEAR THE MUSIC IN MY HEAD AND I ALWAYS HAVE. NOBODY KNOWS THAT. NOBODY KNOWS ME. THIS IS MY HOME. THIS IS WHERE I LIVE. MY NEIGHBORHOOD. THE ISLAND THAT I LIVE ON. I LIKE THE CRAZINESS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THE LIFE HERE. THE STREET LIFE. THE PEOPLE. THE ACTION. IT'S JUST STATEN ISLAND. I KNOW THAT. Woman: SOPHIA! WE NEED SOME DELIVERIES TO MAKE. COME ON, SWEETIE. OK, MAMA. IN A MINUTE. OK, BUT ONLY A MINUTE. BRING IT, BABY! BRING IT! HE FAKES A LEFT. HE FAKES A RIGHT. HE--HE SHOOTS!

SOMEWHERE. I HAVE THIS-- THIS MEMORY OF HER, AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A DREAM OR IF IT'S REAL... BUT I REMEMBER HER. WHEN THINGS GET TOUGH, I THINK BACK WHEN I WASN'T ALONE. WHEN MY MOM FIRST BROUGHT ME HERE. Mom: ARE YOU EXCITED FOR YOUR FIRST DAY AT THIS SCHOOL? NO. NO? MOMMY, CAN YOU GO IN WITH ME? I DON'T KNOW ANY OF THE KIDS. LET ME LOOK AT YOU, OK? I KNOW IT'S A LOT DIFFERENT HERE THAN BACK HOME, BUT UNTIL I CAN MAKE A LITTLE MORE MONEY, THIS IS GONNA BE YOUR NEW SCHOOL, OK? HMM? YEAH? OK, MOMMY. OK. I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED. OK. SOPHIA, COME INSIDE. I NEED YOUR HELP. DO YOU KNOW THAT BOY? YES, MAMA. THAT'S JJ. YOU'VE SEEN HIM A THOUSAND TIMES. HE LIVES IN THE PROJECTS. YEAH, I'VE SEEN HIM. WITH HIS MOTHER. THAT'S NOT HIS REAL MOM. THAT'S HIS FOSTER MOM. MOM, CAN I GO AND TALK WITH HIM, PLEASE? HEY, JJ. HEY. I SAW YOU TALKING WITH YOUR MOM OVER THERE. YEAH. YOU KNOW HOW SHE IS. WELL, I DON'T THINK SHE LIKES ME VERY MUCH. SHE JUST DOESN'T KNOW YOU. YOU HAVE TO GIVE HER SOME TIME. UH... SO, HOW COME YOU WEREN'T IN CLASS THE LAST DAY BEFORE SUMMER? I DIDN'T SEE ANY REASON FOR GOING, YOU KNOW? THE TEACHER SAID WE HAD TO READ OUT LOUD ABOUT WHAT WE WERE GONNA DO ALL SUMMER. YOU KNOW I FEEL LIKE SUCH A JACKASS WHEN I READ OUT LOUD. I'M ALWAYS GETTING WORDS MIXED UP AND STUFF, SO... WELL, I CAN HELP YOU WITH YOUR READING, IF YOU WANT. LOOK, MAYBE I'M JUST NOT SMART ENOUGH TO READ GOOD. WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL THEM THE WORDS GET MIXED UP? I GOT OTHER THINGS TO DO. HOW COME YOU'RE NOT HOME FOR DINNER? MRS. ARDIS DOESN'T LET ME GO HOME TILL DARK. Mama: SOPHIA, WHERE ARE YOU? YOUR MOM'S COMING. WELL, I DON'T CARE. SOPHIA, TIME TO GO. HI. HI. WHY DO YOU TALK WITH THAT BOY, HMM? JJ, narrating: I HAVE THIS DREAM ABOUT MY MOM... THAT IF I JUST HEAD OUT ON MY OWN, ACROSS THE WATER, I CAN LIVE IN SOME FOREST... AND SHE WOULD FIND ME THERE. MAYBE 2 PEOPLE WITH THE SAME DREAMS CAN SEE THE DREAM IN EACH OTHER AND FIND EACH OTHER. MAYBE THERE WAS SOME KIND OF REASON FOR ALL THIS, EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED. Woman: WHAT, ARE YOU NUTS? Man: WHAT'S THE MATTER, GIRL? SLOW DOWN! OOH. HEY, NOAH. HOW YOU DOING? Voice: MOM! REBECCA!

M-MAYBE I CAN GLUE IT TOGETHER. OH, MY GOD. YOU KNOW, THESE WERE NOAH'S MOTHER'S PRESENT. I SCREWED EVERYTHING UP. NO, NO! NO, NO, I NEVER LIKED THESE. THEY WERE FORCED ON ME AS A WEDDING PRESENT. AND THEY'RE SO OLD-FASHIONED. EVEN NOAH HATED THEM. HE WASN'T GOING TO TAKE THEM WITH HIM WHEN HE WENT. OH, NO! OH, MY GOD. [LAUGHS] I MEAN, LOOK AT THESE STUPID PINK FLOWERS. HEY, YOU TRY IT.

SO PLAY ME SOMETHING. OH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO PLAY. YOU HAVE TO HUM ME A TUNE OR SOMETHING. I CAN'T DO THAT! OH, LET ME THINK. THERE WAS A... THERE WAS A SONG BRIAN USED TO REALLY LOVE. IT WAS...UM... [HUMMING] [HUMMING ALONG] IT'S A COOL PIANO. [STRUMMING STRINGS] [DOOR CLOSES] WHY DO YOU KEEP ALL THIS KID STUFF IN HERE? I LIKE IT. YEAH, WELL, WHEN BRIAN COMES TO VISIT, DOESN'T HE FEEL KINDA WEIRD? HE SLEEPS IN THIS ROOM, RIGHT? HE DOESN'T COME VERY OFTEN. WHY NOT? HE'S BUSY. HIS COLLEGE IS FAR AWAY. SO IS THIS BALL REALLY SIGNED BY MICKEY MANTLE? YEP. BRIAN LOVED BASEBALL. NOT ANYMORE? TIME TO SLEEP. GOOD NIGHT. GOD BLESS, BRIAN. HEY. YOU JUST CALLED ME BRIAN. I DID? [WHISPERING] Yeah. WELL, GOOD NIGHT, SLEEP TIGHT, JJ. ALL YEAR, I TRY TO KEEP THESE CHILDREN INSIDE THIS BUILDING. NOW I CAN'T KEEP THEM OUT. WAIT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN &quot;KEEP THEM OUT&quot;? WE HAD A BREAK-IN LAST WEEKEND. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE HAD 5 BREAK-INS IN ONE SCHOOL YEAR. WELL, MAYBE THAT'S WHY JJ's FILE ISN'T HERE. NO, THAT IS NOT WHY JJ's FILE IS NOT HERE. THESE KIDS RUN AWAY ALL THE TIME, MS. SANCHEZ. WHEN YOU'VE BEEN IN THE SYSTEM AS LONG AS I HAVE, YOU DON'T FLY OFF THE HANDLE-- I KNOW HE'S JUST ANOTHER KID TO YOU-- NO, HE IS NOT JUST ANOTHER KID-- PLEASE! PLEASE. I CAN'T LOSE THIS BOY. OH, MY GOD. FOR A MOMENT... YOU REMINDED ME OF MYSELF. LOOK, IF I DON'T FIND HIM NOW, HE IS GOING TO BE OUT THERE ON THE STREET FOREVER. I'M... SORRY. I'M JUST... TIRED. WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP YOU? OK, WELL, I THINK HE MIGHT TRY TO FIND HIS MOM WHO'S SICK. SO I CHECKED SOME OF THESE HOSPITALS, BUT NO LUCK. I CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP EVERY NIGHT. THIS KID, HE WAS LIKE A REAL SON TO ME. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO IF YOU DON'T FIND HIM. YEAH, WELL, WE GOT A PHOTO, SO, UM... WE'LL KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR HIM, MRS. ARDIS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN AND HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE? I CAN MAKE-- NO, NO, THANK YOU, MA'AM. ARE YOU SURE? I MEAN, IT'S INSTANT, BUT-- THAT BOY'S A RUNAWAY FOR SURE. JUST LIKE THE REST OF HER KIDS. JESUS, MARY, AND JOSEPH. WHAT DO YOU WANT? I'M JJ's NEW FRIEND. [SNICKERING] YEAH? SO? WELL, I HEAR YOU'VE BEEN ASKING AROUND ABOUT HIM. WELL, HAVE YOU SEEN HIM? MAYBE. IS THERE SOME KIND OF REWARD? LOOK, HE'S NOT A LOST DOG, ALL RIGHT?

WHERE'S MY TRIBUTE? SOMETHING'S HAPPENED? YEAH. THIS GANGBANGER TOOK MY KEYBOARD. HE PAWNED IT. I WAS WATCHING. WHY DIDN'T YOU HELP ME? YOU'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT HOW THE GUARDIAN PROTECTS EVERYBODY IN THE PARK. SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF A LITTLE BIT. MAYBE YOU'RE NOT CUT OUT FOR THIS LIFE. IT'S HARD. I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT IT BACK. WHERE'D YOU GET THAT KIND OF MONEY, KID? I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO. THE NUMBER ONE RULE IS THAT WE DO NOT CHEAT. MY NUMBER ONE RULE IS I LOOK AFTER JJ. YOU'D BETTER GO HOME, KID. YOU DON'T BELONG HERE! IT'S BETTER TO BE HERE IN THE PARK LIVING OFF SCRAPS THAN TO BE TRAPPED IN A FOSTER HOME WITH THAT WITCH. I'M FREE HERE. THAT'S GOOD. STAND UP FOR YOURSELF. BUT YOU'VE GOTTA DO IT WITHOUT RIPPING ANYBODY OFF. LISTEN TO ME, KID. THIS IS THE SUMMER OF YOUR LIFE. THIS IS THE ONE YOU'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER, THE ONE YOU CROSSED OVER. CROSSED OVER TO WHAT? YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE A BOY ANYMORE. ALL THAT'S GONNA CHANGE. YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR OWN SONG. I HEAR YOU PLAYING OTHER PEOPLE'S SONGS. YOU GOT A GIFT, BUT DON'T SELL YOURSELF SHORT. YOU'RE A PRINCE, KID. YOU DESERVE THE BEST. A PRINCE, HUH? I'M THE KING OF THIS PARK. AND YOU'RE THE PRINCE.

WELL, YOUR CASE WORKER CAME TO OUR APARTMENT, AND THE COPS. I MEAN, THEY'RE LOOKING FOR YOU. YOUR MOM KNOWS YOU'RE HERE? NO. SHE THINKS I'M AT A SLEEP-OVER AT MY FRIEND'S. SHE WON'T MISS ME UNTIL TOMORROW. GOOD, BECAUSE I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE WHOLE PARK. JUST SIT BACK. RELAX. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A GREAT TIME TODAY, OK? HEY. SO THIS IS YOUR DOG? HE'S KIND OF HIS OWN DOG. REALLY BELONGS TO THE PARK. HE'S SO CUTE. IT'S LIKE... WHEN I PLAY MY KEYBOARD... IT'S KINDA LIKE I'M NOT IN THE PROJECTS ANYMORE. I'M NOT WITH MRS. ARDIS AND NOT THAT CAVE IN THE PARK. I JUST FEEL FREE WHEN I PLAY MY MUSIC. I'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU. MUSIC WAS MY ONLY FRIEND BEFORE I MET YOU. [GIGGLES] I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU HERE. NO. I'LL BE ALL RIGHT. I HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE, THERE'S A LOT OF FOOD AROUND THE PARK, SO...JUST DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. I HAD FUN TODAY. YEAH. ME, TOO. SO, UH... CAN I COME SEE YOU SOME TIME? SURE!

WHERE'D YOU GET THE MONEY? WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? I FOUND SOME. YOU'RE LYING. LOOK, IT WAS JUST A DUSTY BASEBALL AND OLD WATCH. HE'S IN COLLEGE NOW. WHAT DOES HE CARE? IT MEANS A LOT TO ME. IT MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO STEAL IT! LOOK, JUST BECAUSE I LIVE IN THE STREETS AND I GOT NO FAMILY AND I GOT NO FRIENDS DOESN'T MEAN I'M A THIEF. I'LL GET THOSE THINGS BACK. YOU DON'T FEEL ANY REMORSE AT ALL, DO YOU? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WORD MEANS. DO YOU FEEL ANYTHING FOR ME? ANYTHING AT ALL? DO YOU EVEN LIKE ME? HEY, LOOK, YOUR PLACE IS JUST ANOTHER FOSTER HOME WITH A BETTER VIEW. YOU KNOW, I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THAT FOR YOU IF YOU'D ASKED. YOU THINK I CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY YOU SOME MUSIC TOY? TELL ME WHY YOU WOULD EVER SPEND MONEY ON ME. NO ONE EVER GAVE ME SOMETHING FOR NOTHING EXCEPT MY MOM. I COULD BE YOUR MOM. NO, YOU CAN'T. YOU SAY THAT 'CAUSE IT SOUNDS GOOD AND IT MAKES YOU FEEL NICE. I WANT TO BE YOUR MOM. NO, YOU DON'T. NOT WHEN IT ALL GETS REAL, YOU DON'T. YOU THINK YOU CAN LIVE WITH ME? LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME. NO ONE IS GONNA WANT ME! WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU DO? JUST THINK OF HOW EMBARRASSED YOU'D BE HAVING ME AROUND YOUR RICH-ASS FRIENDS. YOU COULDN'T BE MY MOM. YOU COULDN'T BE ANYONE'S MOM. WHOA. MY GOD. YOU GOT A MEAN STREAK, DON'T YOU? I DON'T KNOW WHY I NEVER SAW THAT IN YOU BEFORE. YOU JUST THINK PEOPLE ARE MEAN AND NASTY WHEN THEY'RE TELLING THE TRUTH. [HORSE NEIGHS] TIME TO GO HOME, JJ. WHO ARE YOU? WHY ARE YOU DOIN' THIS? HEY, IT'S MY LITTLE BROTHER. I'M JUST TAKING HIM HOME TO HIS MOTHER, THAT'S ALL. I AIN'T GOING BACK THERE, EASY. ARE YOU HIDING BEHIND THIS CRAZY BITCH? DOES IT BOTHER YOU JJ GOT AWAY? WHO ARE YOU, LADY? YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHIN' ABOUT ME, NOTHIN' I BEEN THROUGH. YOU JUST WANT HIM TO TURN OUT LIKE YOU DID, DON'T YOU, EASY? JUST A PETTY CROOK. HEY, YOU! POLICE OFFICER! GET BACK HERE! Officer: I GOT A MUGGER UNDER THE ARCHES. I'M IN PURSUIT. OH... DON'T WORRY. IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. DON'T LEAVE ME, BRIAN. STAY WITH ME, PLEASE. I WON'T EVER LEAVE YOU. AHH... HEY. JJ, I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU. I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU. Nurse: HE'S BEEN IN THE WAITING ROOM ALL NIGHT. THEY WOULDN'T LET ME IN THE ROOM TILL VISITING HOURS. I'M NOT NEXT OF KIN. OH. YOU OK? YEAH. THEY, UM... THEY TAPED MY RIBS A BIT AND, UH... A COUPLE OF STITCHES IN MY HEAD. 13 STITCHES. I'M GONNA GET COFFEE. BUT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU LATER, OK? HEY, IT WASN'T HIS FAULT. SEE YOU IN A LITTLE WHILE, TOUGH GUY. HOW ARE YOU FEELING? OH, I'M--OHH! HA HA. FINE. IT IS ALL MY FAULT. [PATS BED] COME SIT DOWN. YOU KNOW, I SAW YOU IN THE PARK THE OTHER DAY WITH THAT GIRL. I COULD SEE THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT HER. [CLICKS TONGUE] SHE'S THE ONE, ISN'T SHE? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT. SHE'S JUST A GIRL IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. WHO HAPPENED TO COME ALL THE WAY TO CENTRAL PARK JUST TO SEE YOU. ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT? SO MAYBE SHE LIKES ME. WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? THE FIRST ONE IS THE ONE YOU REMEMBER THE LONGEST. I THINK YOU'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER HER. I LOST HER. JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. JJ, YOUR MOM DIDN'T LEAVE YOU. YEAH, HOW DO YOU KNOW? I KNOW. I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS YOUNGER... MY MOM HAD A ROOM JUST LIKE THIS ONE. HONEY, MOST HOSPITAL ROOMS LOOK LIKE THIS ONE. I USED TO SIT WITH HER. I WANTED TO TAKE CARE OF HER LIKE I'D BEEN DOING AT HOME. THEN THESE PEOPLE CAME, AND... THEY SAID SHE COULDN'T TAKE CARE OF ME ANYMORE. AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I SAW HER. WE USED TO WALK TO THE HOSPITAL IN THAT PARK. THIS IS THE ONLY HOSPITAL WITHIN... WALKING DISTANCE TO THE PARK. OH! OK. I ALWAYS KNEW YOU WERE NUTS. YEAH. AH! DON'T LOOK AT MY BUTT CRACK. COME ON. WHERE ARE WE GOING? IF YOUR MOTHER WAS IN THIS HOSPITAL, THEN WE ARE GONNA FIND SOMEBODY WHO CAN TELL US WHAT HAPPENED TO HER. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, REBECCA? COME ON, HONEY. Woman: THAT WASN'T WHAT I SAID. YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO ME. ...COPY OF THIS, AND-- JJ, PLEASE DON'T RUN. WHO ARE YOU? SHE'S MY CASE WORKER. SHE'S ALL RIGHT. HOW DID YOU FIND HIM? I DIDN'T. I FOUND HIS MOM. YOU FOUND HER? I CONTACTED EVERY HOSPITAL IN NEW YORK. SHE WAS GIVEN RADIATION TREATMENT IN THIS HOSPITAL, AND I FOUND THE NURSE WHO CARED FOR HER... THE NURSE WHO CARED FOR HER WHEN SHE DIED. OH, JJ, THIS IS NURSE YAGER. JJ IS THE SON OF ANNALISSE. HOW DO YOU DO, JJ? I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. WOULD YOU PLEASE TELL JJ WHAT YOU TOLD ME? YOUR MOTHER ASKED ME TO CALL THE FOSTER MOTHER TAKING CARE OF YOU. MRS. ARDIS. THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR. SHE PROMISED TO BRING YOU IN FOR VISITS, BUT SHE NEVER CAME, NOT EVEN AFTER I CALLED AND SAID THAT YOUR MOTHER HAD PASSED AWAY. WHERE IS JJ? CAN I SEE MY BOY? CAN YOU PLEASE BRING ME MY BOY? HE'S NOT HERE, ANNALISSE. THAT'S OK. I DON'T WANT HIM TO SEE ME LIKE THIS. IT'S OK. TELL MY BOY I LOVE HIM. JJ, NO! Annalisse: PLEASE... CAN YOU FIND MY BOY? PLEASE... OH, THANK YOU. YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAND GUARD, REBECCA. I'M NOT GONNA TAKE ANYTHING FROM BRIAN'S ROOM. JJ! I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME HOME. WHY DIDN'T BRIAN COME TO THE HOSPITAL TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE OK? WHAT? I MEAN, YOU'RE HIS MOM, RIGHT? WHAT KIND OF SON DOESN'T COME SEE HIS MOM WHEN SHE'S HURT? AND HOW COME NONE OF THESE PHOTOS SHOW HIM GROWN UP? JJ. I SHOULDN'T HAVE LET HER TELL ME THESE FAIRY TALES THIS WHOLE TIME ABOUT BRIAN. NOAH, STOP HIM. GET IT SAID, JJ. YOU CALLED ME A LIAR. SOMETIMES I PRETEND, BUT IT MAKES ME FEEL A LOT BETTER WHEN EVERYTHING'S CRUMMY. WHY CAN'T I CALL YOU A LIAR? NO! YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS OF MY BOY. HE WASN'T LIKE YOU AT ALL. REBECCA, THEY'RE A LOT ALIKE. THEY ARE NOTHING LIKE EACH OTHER. IT'S ALL MADE UP. GET OUT. I WANT YOU OUT OF MY HOME. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER. YEAH, I KNEW YOU WOULD SAY THAT WHEN YOU WERE READY TO GET RID OF ME. MY SON WAS NEVER THIS DISRESPECTFUL TO ME. AND WHERE IS HE NOW? RETARDED, IN SOME HOSPITAL? MAYBE HE'S IN JAIL, HUH? OUR SON IS DEAD. YOU PROMISED. I SHOULDN'T HAVE. JJ's RIGHT. WE WERE WRONG PLAYING THESE LITTLE GAMES. HOW OLD WAS HE? HE WAS 14. REBECCA, I'M NOT HIM. HE'S DEAD. MY SON IS DEAD. REBECCA... I WANT HIM BACK. HE'S GONE, REB. OH, THIS IS YOUR REVENGE... BECAUSE I LET HIM DIE. THAT'S ANOTHER LIE YOU TELL YOURSELF. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. I THOUGHT I WAS HELPING, BUT I WAS JUST ALLOWING IT TO HAPPEN. YOU TOOK EVERYTHING. BUT THAT WASN'T ENOUGH FOR YOU. NO, NO, NO. NO, YOU HAD TO TAKE MY ILLUSIONS. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE LIVED WITH THESE LIES. AT LEAST I HAD A LIE TO LIVE WITH! HE DROWNED, REB. HE DROWNED! IT HAPPENS EVERY DAY... ALL THE TIME. KIDS... ARE DROWNING. THEY'RE DROWNING. WHY CAN'T WE LET HIM BE AT PEACE? I HURT. YOU DON'T KNOW. I FEEL THINGS. I FEEL AS THOUGH THE FLESH AROUND MY HEART WERE BEING EATEN AWAY EVERY DAY! BRING HER HOME, JJ. REBECCA NEEDS YOU, YOU KNOW. IT'S YOU SHE REALLY NEEDS. YOU'VE ALREADY HELPED HER MORE THAN I EVER COULD. YOU DID THE RIGHT THING, JJ. ARE YOU GUYS GONNA GET BACK TOGETHER? SOME THINGS CAN'T BE FIXED THAT WAY, JJ. IT'S NOT SOMETHING... YOU CAN JUST GLUE TOGETHER. THERE'S TOO MANY BROKEN PIECES. BUT WE CAN STILL BE A PART OF YOUR LIFE, TAKE CARE OF YOU, RAISE YOU, IF YOU LET US. IT'S OK. YOU GUYS DON'T NEED TO PUT UP WITH ME. YOU GOT OTHER THINGS TO DO. JJ... YOU GOTTA LET SOMEONE IN SOME TIME. IT'S NOT A BAD THING TO LET SOMEONE LOVE YOU. HERE. BRING IT IN. LEFT. WHY AM I TELLING YOU? YOU DO IT BETTER THAN I DO. LOOK. ITS NOSE IS DIPPING. THAT'S MY MOM. &quot;SOMERLED.&quot; YEAH. THAT'S IT. GIVE YOU 5 MINUTES. THEN WE BEGIN. THANK YOU. HOW ARE WE DOING? WE WANNA KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO JJ. LOOK, I CAN ONLY PROMISE YOU I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN FOR JJ. BUT THE FOSTER MOTHER HAS A PRIOR ENFORCEABLE AGREEMENT WITH COUNTY SERVICES. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN BUREAUCRAT? THE JUDGE MAY SEND HIM BACK TO MRS. ARDIS. I WON'T LET HIM. WELL, WHAT ARE YOU PREPARED TO DO? YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK, JJ. YEAH, WELL, NOW THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT THE PARK, THEY'RE JUST GONNA KEEP SENDING PEOPLE TO FIND ME. JJ... THANK GOD YOU'RE SAFE! OH! YOU HAD ME WORRIED SICK! YEAH, SURE. UH, MRS. ARDIS, ALTHOUGH JJ DID RUN AWAY, HE'S COME BACK OF HIS OWN FREE WILL, AND IN OUR TALKS, QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT YOUR CARE OF HIM. I HAVE INFORMED THE FAMILY COURT JUDGE THAT IN MY OPINION JJ IS AT IMMINENT RISK WITH YOU. I DIDN'T COME HERE TO GET AMBUSHED, OK? AND I DON'T WANT TO ARGUE. I KNOW MY RIGHTS. JJ's COMING HOME WITH ME. YOU CAME TO GET YOUR PROPERTY. WELL, WHERE WERE YOU FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS WHEN HE NEEDED A HOME? OK? I TOOK CARE OF HIM! YOU KEPT HIM FROM HIS MOTHER WHEN SHE WAS DYING. LOOK, SWEETIE, I ONLY DID THAT TO PROTECT YOU, OK? REALLY. HONEST TO GOD. NO. YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME. WHY? SO YOUR LAST MEMORY OF YOUR MOTHER IS HER LAYING IN A COFFIN 6 FEET UNDER? I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO HURT. GET THE HELL OFF ME. MISS, MISS. YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID. BACK OFF. LOOK, I KNOW ABOUT ALL YOU RICH PEOPLE, OK? YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE IN A KID. IT'S LIKE GOIN' TO A PET STORE AND BUYIN' A PUPPY. GUESS WHAT? THEN THEY GROW UP. THEN WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? BRING HIM BACK TO ME? I'M GOING TO ADOPT HIM. DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE A LITTLE TOO OLD FOR THAT, LADY? COME ON, JJ. NO. I'M A GOOD MOTHER. I'M GONNA SEE TO IT YOU DON'T TAKE ANY MORE KIDS HOME. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO RAISE JJ. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE A MOTHER TO HIM. BUT YOU DIDN'T DO THAT. YOU BROKE HIS SPIRIT, OR YOU TRIED TO. YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HIM! YOU JUST USED HIM FOR THE MONEY HE BROUGHT IN. YOU LIED TO THE CASE WORKERS AND YOU LEFT HIM OUT ON THE STREET! I HAVE A CONTRACT. I PROVIDE A SERVICE. IF YOU EVER COME NEAR JJ AGAIN, I WILL SEE TO IT YOU ARE SCRUBBING FLOORS AT THE WOMEN'S CORRECTIONAL CENTER. HA. I DIDN'T COMMIT ANY CRIMES. YOU KNOW, MRS. ARDIS, I CHECKED THE LIST OF KIDS YOU'VE CARED FOR OVER THE YEARS, AND I CAME ACROSS THE NAME OF SOMEONE WHO HAS. HE'S CALLED EASY. EASY? THE KID THAT MUGGED ME. HE WAS YOURS? LOOK, I KNOW YOU SENT THAT BOY. I HAD A LOT OF THOSE KIDS. I DON'T REMEMBER EVERY NAME. YEAH, WELL, I'M GONNA DO A FULL REVIEW OF ALL THE KIDS YOU'VE CARED FOR FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS, AND I'M GONNA FIND EACH ONE OF THEM AND TALK TO THEM. YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND THEM. THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE COCKROACHES IN THE STREETS. YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THE LAST OF THIS. I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS IN THIS BUSINESS. OH... [EXHALES] HMM. YOU KNOW, WHEN WE GET DONE HERE, LET'S GO HOME.
