♪ ♪ ♪ (Car door closing) (Knocking on door) (Sighing) - Hey! - Jeez, Blair! You scared the crap out of me! - Sorry! I saw a neighborhood watch outside. So, I didn't want her to see me coming through the front door, so I slid in the back. - How was the pool party? - Eh, Megan's parents came home early, so you really didn't miss much. - Well, I wasn't invited, remember? - You still could have come! - And forget they were all jerks about my mom? No, thank you! I'd rather make the babysitting money. - Care, they aren't even talking about that anymore, OK? - Really? 'Cause Brady sent me a text asking if I could sexually harass him too. - Well, Brady acts like a 12-year-old idiot, so forget about it, all right? Come on! Don't they have any good food here? - I can't just forget about it, B. Someone set up my mom! And whoever did it is obviously from this neighborhood. I just have to figure out who it was. - OK... Well, did you find anything in here? - No! Just this. (Scoffing) - Get out! - Oh yeah. And they have a set of cuffs by their bed. - Kinky! Did you find any skanky videos? - No. They don't even have Netflix. - Wow. No snacks and no streaming. Hope they pay you decent. (Laughing) - Only if he pays. The wives are always cheap. - Well, not if they come home drunk, like Janice Murphy. - Why don't you give her my number? - She remarried some guy who has a teenager, so she doesn't need a sitter anymore. - Hmm. - Or a friend like this! - Ugh! (Car door closing) They're home! - Oh my God! OK! I'll text you later. (Woman talking, indistinct) - You're lying to me on the day of your daughter's recital. - Why am I lying? What am I lying about? You know I do business outside the office. - David, we'll talk about it later. - Yeah. - Hey! - Carrie, I'm so sorry. We're a bit late. - Oh, no, that's OK. It's still summer break for me. - How was Emma? - Great! She didn't complain at all at bedtime. - Great. Well, that's 'cause you're so good with her. Uh, Viv, I'm short on cash. - I got it. Thank you, Carrie. - Thank you. - See you across the street. - Good night, Mrs. Kelly! - Have a good night! (Vivian talking, indistinct) - I feel like you're not hearing me and you're not listening to me! I feel very, like... You're in another world all the time. You're just working. And--and the lying! Like, I--I understand that you had a meeting today, but I don't understand why... (Vivian continues talking, indistinct) - Carrie! Isn't it past your curfew? - I was babysitting for the Kellys. - Again? Hmm... I don't blame Vivian for being upset with David. I'd be angry too if my husband lied to me about golfing instead of going to his daughter's recital. - How do you know that's what they're fighting about? - I saw David leaving for work today with his golf clubs. A wife's got a right to know what her husband's up to. - But I need you to make us the priority. She should be the priority. - Thank you for removing that sign from your lawn. Vandalism just makes the neighborhood so ugly. Good night. - (Whispering): Bitch. - (Man on radio): A 9-year-old metro girl has a new lease on life, thanks to... - Hey! I didn't hear you come in last night. - Yeah, the Kellys didn't get home till after midnight. - Sorry, there's not much to eat. I'll bring some groceries home from work. - Someone, uh, left one of your old campaign posters on the front lawn last night. I thought people were done with it. - You know, I'm sure as soon as this next campaign ramps up, they will be. - Is that douche working another campaign? - I don't know. - Well, I hope someone accuses him of sexual harassment and screws his career. - Oh, Carrie... Come on, please. Let's put this behind us, OK? I'll see you tonight. - OK. - Advertisers are often faced with the problem of catching respectful customers. Well, take the case of... (Man on radio continues talking, indistinct) (Sighing) - Mom! - Thank you, sweetheart. Hey! Good luck on your job interview. - Thank you. - I will see you later. - Mmm! We'll be waiting! - I love you! - I love you! Have a great day at work, sweetie! (Engine starting) - So, what's this job you're interviewing for? - Just, like, a part-time job at the coffee house to help out my mom. She says we're fine, but I... Like, I know we're not. (♪ Pop playing on speaker ♪) - OK, well, what about your dad? Can't he help out with anything? - Blair, my dad's been MIA for, like, 10 years. I wouldn't do that to my mom. - Well, I think this whole thing sucks. I know your mom. She would never hit on some 25 year old with a hard-on for politics. - No, there's no way. I just wish I knew who did it. - Yeah. - Excuse me, ladies! Do you mind keeping it down? Daniel is such a light napper, and he'll be cranky if he wakes up too soon. (Lowers volume) - (Blair): Could she be any more annoying? - No, she treats that kid like he's God's gift and she's Mother Theresa. She made my mom take down all her birdhouses 'cause she didn't like that they were crapping on her deck. - No. Seriously? - Yeah. Trust me. She would lobby to ban birds from the neighborhood if she could. - Hey! Let me drive you to your interview later so that we can hang out longer. Cool? - OK. - OK. Oh! Have you seen the meme of the dog and the vacuum? You're gonna lose it. Look at this. (Both laughing) How good is that? I seriously watched this, like, 100 times. Maybe I'll come in and have an iced mocha while you do your interview. - Yeah. What the hell? - What's going on? Why are they towing my car? - Looked to me like the car was parked too close to the hydrant. That, or somebody thought it was meant for the junk yard. - Are you serious? - My job interview! I'm gonna be so late. Oh, I have to go. Blair, I'm so sorry! I'll call you later! - OK! indistinct)g, - Carrie! Is everything all right? It's late! Did your job interview go OK? - Blair's car got towed, so I was late. - Oh! I'm sorry, sweetie. - Excuse me! Do you mind not overpacking the bag? - Sorry. - I'm sure it was Mrs. Cooper who called. (Sighing) The hydrant was in front of her house. - Does it matter who called? - No, no. Don't put the bread at the bottom. - Sorry. - Mom, seriously. I can't do anything without her shoving her nose in my business, our business! - Have a nice night! Look, I know that she can be a busybody, but she is our neighbor, OK? We just have to tolerate her for now. - Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I... I'm just venting. - Oh, I'm sorry. You shouldn't have to worry about getting a job so much. - Like you shouldn't be bagging groceries. - Hey, there is no shame in it, right? I'm just doing what I have to do right now. We both just have to make the best of it, OK? Do you want to wait till my shift's over? I can give you a ride home. - No, it's OK. I'm gonna take the bus. OK... - Carrie... Just remember, nobody is perfect, no matter how green their grass is. (Insects chirring) - (Madeline): Did you see the urns out in front? I thought they'd look perfect if I added a little nightshade to them. - Oh, thank you. Um, well, what did you do to the ones last year? I liked those. - The hydrangeas? Yeah, I could pot those instead. - You know, you should do whatever you like, Maddie. You always make the place look great. Oh, by the way, I have to fly to Chicago next week. - Mmm! Again? - Maddie, it's the job. - I know. It's just... It's so quiet without you here. - Well, I'm sure you've got something going on, I mean, some lobby or crusade. - Actually... (Inhaling sharply) I'm seriously thinking about running for councilor in this next election. That way, I could lobby to have our little street gated, something our neighbor pooh-poohed when she was councilor. - Well, I think running is a fantastic idea.

That deserves a popsicle. - Mmm! (Laughing) (Chuckling) - There you go, heavy hitter! - Thanks! - Oh! When did you get that? - I don't know. - OK, I'll go get something to clean it up. I'm sorry. I--I was just looking for a Band-Aid. (Sighing) (Carrie): OK... I'm sorry. I don't know how she did it. - Don't be sorry. I appreciate the time you take with Emma. So, here, take this. Think of it as a bonus. See you when I get home! - Bye, Mommy! - Be good! - Mm-hmm! (Chuckling softly) (Door opening, closing) - I can't believe you actually busted her. - Hey, Mrs. Kelly! Need a hand? - Thanks, Carrie, but this is the last of it. - Well, I was just coming by to say thank you again for your bonus yesterday. - I told you, Carrie. We appreciate you. - I know. Which is great, because I was gonna tell you that I raised my hourly rate, you know, to help my mom. And, I mean, I-I guess you could hire somebody cheaper, but I doubt they would know you and your habits as well as I do. - Of course we wouldn't hire someone else. Just let me know what your new rate is, and I'll be happy to pay. - Great! ♪ I was a nice young girl ♪♪ (Laughing) You were so right. They totally went for it. And so did the Pattersons! - What dirt do you have on them? - Just that Mr. Patterson pretends to go to work every day because he doesn't want anyone on the street to know he was fired for fraud. - No way! Seriously? - I found his termination papers when I was babysitting. - Wow! You are the boss. (Chuckling) - I kind of am. The only thing that would make this better is if I could find something that'll tell me who set my mom up, because, you're right, no one should judge when everyone has something to hide. ♪ ♪ ♪ - (John): Madeline? - I'll be right down!

They must have been so happy. - Yeah, I mean, I think so. They're booking a holiday. (♪ Soft jazz playing on stereo ♪) You know, we should do that too. - Hmm. - Just go away for a night, just the two of us. - But who would look after Daniel? - Well, we'd find someone. What about Carrie next door? She babysits, right? - She does. But overnight? I don't know if I can trust him with someone for that long. - Oh, come on. You... Other than nursery school, you never even leave him. Hey, you've got a degree in marketing. You're too smart for just baby talk. - I know. Which is why I have formally thrown my hat in the ring for councilor. That should keep me busy, don't you think? - Cheers! - Mmm. - Mmm! (Phone buzzing) - Hello? This is she. Right, I understand. OK. I'll come by tomorrow. - Everything OK? (Sighing) - My mother is fighting her physio nurse. They think she'd respond better with me there, so looks like I'll need a sitter after all! (Chuckling) - Oh. (Knocking on door) - Carrie! Come in. - Thanks. - You know, I think this is the first time you've been in my home. What do you think? - It's nice. - Nice? You know, my house was featured in the Blythwood Post. - Oh, that's great! - Thank you. Can you believe I've never used a babysitter before? I mean, Daniel goes to nursery school, but that's different. There are qualified ECE teachers watching him. Now, on the fridge is my cell phone and my mom's landline and a list of dos and don'ts for Daniel. Why don't you read it while I check on him? - Sure. (Sighing) (Exhaling sharply) - So, Daniel's still napping, but there are two-way monitors in most rooms, so you'll hear when he wakes up. Now, I'll be gone for a few hours. But if you're available, I'll need you at the same time for the next couple of weeks. - I'll be there! - Great! Daniel's dinner is in the fridge. Don't overheat it.

And then I'm gonna throw a few stones of my own. - Daniel, sweetheart! Mommy's back! - (Man on TV): Corn on the cob coming right up! (♪ Man on TV singing ♪) - Oh, no! No! No, no! He can't have sugar after 6:00! Didn't you read the list? (Sighing) Here, although I don't know what I'm paying for if you can't take simple instruction. - Um, actually, Mrs. Cooper, all the other neighbors pay me $20 an hour. - Carrie, you're lucky I'm not docking you for the cost of fixing the dent in my car when you were in charge of Emma. - Well, what about the towing cost for my friend's car? - That was a safety hazard. After all, what if it was your house that was burning down, and the firefighters couldn't get to the hydrant, and your poor mom had to watch all that she has left go up in smoke? Wouldn't that just be awful? After already losing so much. - I'll see you next week! Same time. - Mm-hmm. - And I can see monsieur there is someone who likes his food very delicious. - It was her. It's her fault you had to step down. Now you can prove you were set up. (Sighing) - I mean, Carrie, these still... They don't prove anything. - How can you say that? Why else would she have pictures of you with this guy? She must have hired a detective or something to take pictures and dig up dirt. - What if it was her? Hmm? Well, what if it was someone else? What if it was... Oh my God! What if it was a conspiracy of people trying to get me to step down? Carrie, you're never gonna change people's views. Because once you've been judged by the court of public opinion, that's it! It's over. - I don't believe that. - Ah! - I know it was her. And she should pay, just like you did. (Sighing) ((Door opening)) - Hey! - Hey! - Did you fill my car up with gas? - Yeah. The Kellys raised my rate. - Hey! You know, I have the night off. Do you wanna binge watch something like we used to? - Sure. - OK. I'll make popcorn. - OK. - See you down there. (Sighing) (Birds chirping) - Carrie, hi! Ah! I'm sorry. I meant to call you earlier, but my day has just gotten away from me. But I won't be needing you anymore. (Daniel laughing) - Excuse me? - I need someone who follows instructions. I went to a babysitting service. I mean, they aren't cheap either, but they're bonded and vetted, so I don't mind paying. - Yeah, it's just that I actually canceled another babysitting job to make this work. - I'm sorry, but I--I already have someone here. I'm sure you understand. And there's a list on the fridge! (Screaming) (Laughing) - Whoo! (Carrie sighing) - Hey, B. (Scoffing) You're not gonna believe what the witch next door just pulled. No, I'm coming over right now. (Microwave beeping) - Daniel! Daniel! (Breathing heavily) - He's wearing a blue polo and beige overalls. And he's carrying a train. He always has his toy train. - Uh-huh. OK. - Thank you. - John... - Hey. - I looked everywhere, the whole neighborhood, the school, the park... - I know. - I don't know where he is. - We'll find him, I promise. - We have to! - I know! - I'm so sorry. - Get away from us! - Hey... - What's going on? - Daniel's wandered off somewhere. - What do you mean? How? Where was the babysitter? - Getting dinner or something. I don't know. - I'll help look for him. - Thank you. That'd be fantastic. - Yeah, no problem. - I have to get inside. - No, OK. Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. - Daniel! (Men and women talking, indistinct) Daniel! (Sighing) Daniel! Daniel! Daniel! Daniel! Daniel? (Breathing heavily) Daniel! Daniel! (Knocking on door) - Mama! - It's OK. It's OK, baby. It's OK. You stay here. It's OK! I saw the amber alert. - What time are your parents coming home? - I told you, later, but I'm not worried about them catching us! - No one will catch us, OK? Everyone's gonna think I'm a hero. Then I'll have my way back in with the Coopers. It's gonna be fine. - Well, I hope it was worth it. (Grunting) - OK. - Mama! - Yeah! - Mama! - The gate was locked. I'm sure of it. Unless that sitter opened it. She's such a stupid girl! - No, we'll find him. (Daniel screaming) - Oh my God! Daniel! - Daniel! Daniel! Oh my God! Oh my God! (Crying) Daniel, baby! Oh, come here! Come here! Where were you? Where did you go? - I know he loves trains. I checked by the tracks, and he was there! - What do you mean? What was he doing? - He was playing with his train! - And no one saw him? - I guess not! I don't know. - Carrie, we can't tell you how grateful we are. - No. It's OK. I--I'm just so glad we found him. - Listen, uh, the police, they're probably gonna wanna speak to you, OK? - Yeah, yeah. I know. - Thank you. Thank you again! - Yeah. - And--and believe me, from now on, nobody takes care of our kid except for you, OK? - OK. - Hey, buddy! (Breathing heavily) (Sighing) (Phone buzzing) Hey... - Hey. - You coming to bed? - Yeah. I just wanted to check on him again. - Maddie, you're not gonna be able to watch him for every minute of every day. - And now everyone is going to think I'm like Vivian across the street, neglectful of her child. - No. No one's gonna think that. And even if they do, who cares? 'Cause it's never gonna happen again. We're gonna make sure he's always in the best hands. Never. - I still can't believe she just found him. - Well, thankfully, she did. Come to bed. - I will. I promise. - OK. (Text whooshing) - Now, don't forget, no sugar. And don't let him out of your sight. In fact, just--just stay in the house. I've locked all the doors: the back door, the gate... You have everything you need here, so... - We'll be fine. I promise. - Now, unfortunately, I'll be at my mother's a little longer today. I should be back no later than 10:00. - Uh, so, is Mr. Cooper around in case of emergency? - He's away on business. - And you're just gonna be at your mom's the whole time? I'm only asking in case you want to throw another number up there on the fridge. - If you need me, just call me on my cell. - Great. (Scoffing) (Line ringing) Blair?

(Inhaling deeply) Anyway, I won't be needing you next week, as my mom's being moved to a home, but thank you. - Actually, I don't think this will quite cover it. - I've paid your new rate, Carrie, even if I do think it's extortion. I think you owe me and my mom a lot more. - Really? And how is that? - I saw the photos you took of her. - So, you've been going through my things? Good to know. - What are you doing? - I hardly think you need to be paid for snooping. - You set my mom up! - I did nothing of the sort. But if someone did, maybe they thought your mom wasn't doing a good enough job for the neighborhood. I mean, do you know the taxes we pay to live here? - My mom lost her job, people's respect. - You need to go now, Carrie. (Sighing) - I saw you with him. - What exactly did you see? - Doesn't matter. 'Cause we know that people are so quick to judge. - It most definitely matters, Carrie. So, what did you see? When did you see it? And what does it prove? (Scoffing) Why aren't you answering me? Is it because you were somewhere you weren't supposed to be? Because leaving a child unattended is a crime. Go home, Carrie. (Sighing) - I'm sure your husband would love to know what you were up to. - Really? And what's he gonna say to that, when you have no evidence of any kind? Besides, he's been screwing his assistant for the last 3 years, so I doubt he'd have much to say about it anyway. You're done. (Sighing) (Line ringing) - (Man): You miss me already? - Someone knows, Clark. And everything you've done for me will have been for nothing if it all comes out, so we're done. - Then you asked me for another $25,000. So we're done when I say we're done. (Sighing) - So, how skanky was this lingerie? - Oh! Hey, neighbor! Hey, listen, I've been meaning to pop over and properly thank you for finding Daniel. - No, thank you, but I can't take that. It means enough to know I'm your number-one sitter. - That's right! Because you found Daniel! (Chuckling) Sweetheart, what do you think of this as a campaign slogan? "Cooper cares." - What campaign? - Oh, well, Maddie's running for councilor. I mean, I'm sure she's spoken to your mother about it, right? - Actually, I haven't had the chance. - Don't worry. I'll let her know. - Hey, uh, Carrie, if you're free, we have a retirement party tomorrow And, uh, I mean, I'd love it if you could take care of Daniel. - Of course. I'll see you then! - Great! (Sighing) (Insects chirring) - (Anna): I un-I understand. Yeah, if you could just give me 30 days, then I could pay last month's taxes and this month-- No, I can't tomorrow. I work. (Anna sighing) Yeah. OK, bye. - What was that about? - Oh, nothing, honey. Just juggling some things. - You know, Mr. Cooper offered me money for finding Daniel. I could take it. - Well, if he does it again, you should. You should keep it. You deserve it. (Sighing) - You know, Mrs. Cooper is running for councilor. Maybe that was her plan all along. - Ah! We just have to hope she doesn't win. - You know she's gonna do everything she can to make sure she does. (Sighing) - So, do I have to attend this party? - Well, spouses are welcome, so, yeah, it'd be nice. Ah, crap. Hey, do we have a charge cord up here? - Should be one in the dresser. - Oh, hon, you know, you really shouldn't have told Anna you were running. I mean, despite the whole harassment debacle, we still are neighbors. - (Whispering): Unfortunately. So, how long are we expected to stay? - Oh, not too long. I wouldn't worry about it. Carrie's proven to be reliable, certainly trustworthy. - Actually, I'm not so sure about that. The night I went to see my mom, she was clearly going through our things. - Well, were you worried she'd find this? - That was meant to be a surprise. - Well, it still could be, when you put it on. Tonight? - Well then, it wouldn't be a surprise, now would it? So you're just gonna have to wait for it. (Sighing) I tried knocking, but I figured this is where you would be. - What do you want? - I just want to know more about how you found Daniel the other night. It would give me peace of mind, so I can make sure it doesn't happen again. - I told you, I found him by the tracks. - And what was he doing? - Playing, you know, with his train. - On the ground? - Yeah. - In clear sight? - No, he was, um, he was behind these, like, crates there. - Oh. That's amazing! I mean, what a coincidence that you of all people were able to find him so effortlessly. - Yeah, well, you know, Daniel and his train... Just put two and two together. - That would make sense, wouldn't it? So much, you wouldn't even question it, except Daniel didn't have any dirt on his clothes. Not a spot. Which is odd, don't you think, if he was playing on the ground? - I know how much you hate when he's dirty, so I brushed him off for you. - How thoughtful of you. - Don't you have a party to get ready for? See you at 6:00! (Chuckling softly) (Men and women chatting, laughing) (♪ Pop playing on stereo ♪) - Oh, hey, uh, I should say hello. - OK. - Gentlemen... How are you doing? (Talking indistinctly) Better not be on my bill. Listen, you guys just keep it, you know... All right. - That's back pay.

Oh, it's been too long! - Madeline! - So good to see you! (Sighing) (Camera clicking) (Grunting) - Hide this, you bitch! - So, does Anita have any thoughts on retirement? - Oh, no, she says as long as she's still standing, she's not retiring. - So, I don't have to worry about some hot, young assistant anytime soon? - Hey, Maddie... (Sighing) You don't have to worry about anyone. I promise. Is there anyone I should be worried about? - Mmm, of course not. - Good. Mmm. Hey, Carrie! - Hey! - How was everything? - Great! - Yeah? Good. Listen, I know you said you couldn't just take it, so, you know what? Just consider it a bonus. - Thank you, Mr. Cooper. - You're welcome. - Oh, and, um, Mrs. Cooper, I forgot to mention, the other night, when you were out after your mom's the motel called, said you left something in the room. - Yes, I retrieved it. Thank you, Carrie. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Well, I think that you were right about Carrie! Everything seems really great here! - Huh. When were you in a hotel? - Uh, I think that was when you were in Boston. - And what were you doing there exactly? - I was meeting with a campaign manager. Fiona Scott? She was Dwight's manager in Borel County. She was passing through, and agreed to meet me! - Oh. And? - And, mmm... Turns out our schedules don't really match. But sounds like Daniel is fast asleep, so... - So... - Mom? - No, she, uh, she already left for work when I got up this morning, so... But she's home now. What's going on? - Blair, you should go home, OK? Carrie will call you later. - OK. - Carrie, Mrs. Cooper would like to give you an opportunity to explain your behavior. - What behavior? - Stealing, destroying personal property. (Scoffing) - You installed security cameras? Why would you do that? - I'd say it was necessary. Wouldn't you think? - Mrs. Cooper should come clean about what she did. - Carrie, that is not what this is about. - No, it is what this is about, Mom. She wrote a check, Mom, for $25,000, to William Beck. See? She paid him off to say you harassed him! - I don't think it's a crime to donate towards a young man's political ambitions, but as far as what Carrie did, I wouldn't be out of line to notify the police. - Madeline, that isn't going to be necessary. - I don't know. Is it? Who's to say she hasn't violated our other neighbors in the same way? - I have no problems with the other neighbors. - Well, I'd like to think that you're telling the truth, but in case you aren't, I'll agree not to go to the police, as long as you agree to stop babysitting. - I use that money to help my mom, and I wouldn't have to if it weren't for you. - Carrie, Carrie... I don't think that Mrs. Cooper's request is unreasonable. Of course, she will pay for the damage to your floors. And I think that we can all agree that nobody needs to know the circumstances of why she stopped babysitting. - Of course. I can understand why you wouldn't want another scandal plaguing your house. - You are such a hypocrite! - I'll walk you to the door. - Thank you. - Madeline! We both know you don't give a damn about that boy's ambitions. So, let's call us even, OK? - Mom... I was just trying to find something, and I did. And now you can prove it was her! - Carrie, you have got to stop. Because all you're doing now is sabotaging your own future. - So, you're not gonna do anything? - What do you want me to do? I've told you that it isn't gonna make any difference. So what else is there? Do you want to move? Do you... Do you want me to sell the only thing that I have worth anything? Because that isn't gonna help right now! Don't you think that I want to rip her head off? Because I didn't support her views on condos and I didn't lobby for a stupid gate! But then what? She's still our neighbor. Oh, Carrie, you have got to let this go! Because the person that I saw on that video... that is not you. - I can't say I'm surprised that you're gonna run for council, Madeline. You do so much for the community already. - Well, I think we can all agree we want our kids to grow up in the best neighborhood in the city. (Chuckling softly) Mmm! Speaking of which, I caught our neighborhood sitter, Carrie, snooping in my house. Thankfully, I don't have any secrets to hide. Not like you. - What are you talking about? - Oh, come on, Vivian. You don't think I notice that strange car that pulls up to your house every week, by a driver whom you never welcome inside? I mean, I'm not surprised, based on his appearance. Although, you do seem very happy to give him cash, in exchange for, what, pills? Coke? I'm gonna go with cocaine, based on how dilated your pupils are. - Your accusations are offensive, Madeline. - Really? Is the reason you pay Carrie so much because she found something when she was watching Emma? If you tell me, I'd be less inclined to voice my concerns with your husband. - It's not something I'm proud of, Madeline. - Of course not. Is that all Carrie wanted from you? Money? - I think so. (Inhaling deeply) You're not gonna tell David, are you? I mean, I'm trying to get a handle on it. - Just clean up your act, Vivian. 'Cause I don't pay the taxes I do to live across the street from a junkie who brings trash into my neighborhood. And if it's not taken care of by the time I run for council, Child Services may just be getting a call. (Sighing) (Door opening, closing) (Car approaching) - Hey, Mr. Cooper! How's Daniel? - He's fine, Carrie, despite us putting our trust in you. - Hey, I'm sorry about what I did. I was just upset with Mrs. Cooper for what she did to my mom, and now what she's doing to you. - Are you talking about the affair, Carrie? Because she told me all about it, about how you tried to extort money from her and the neighbors with your lies. So you could get, what, $20 an hour? - I didn't make it up, any of it. I swear! She paid off that campaign worker $25,000. - Enough, Carrie. - The lingerie she was wearing the other night, she wore it at the motel. Just ask her. ♪ ♪ ♪ (Sighing) - It's catchy, don't you think?

There she is! Love the sign, but, uh, that smile, so much better in person! - Happy birthday, Clark! It's nice to see you. - Well, what? No birthday hug from the prettiest girl I know? Next to your mom, of course. She was the most beautiful woman in the room. - How are you, Clark? - Good. Feeling like a young lad these days. - John, do you want to get a Clark a drink? And I'm gonna go check on Daniel. - What can I get you? (Clears throat) I couldn't have thought of a better way to spend my birthday! - Well, we were glad to have you. - Well, let's not leave it so long next time, huh? - Carrie... Can we help you? - I was just wondering if you got a new car. - She's a beauty, huh? Even though she does kind of chew through my wallet in gas. - Ah, who cares if it makes a statement? - Oh, let me guess. The entrepreneur, right? - Mmm. I should go check on Daniel. (Talking, indistinct) - Are you sure you're OK to drive? - Are you kidding? A couple of drinks aren't enough to bring this guy down. Huh? You didn't hear that! Anyway, give that little spitfire a kiss from Grandpa! (Engine starting) (Sighing) (Phone buzzing) - Mmm. Who's texting you so late? - Just a reminder to look at my campaign page before it goes live. - Oh. OK. Um, do you want me to get these? - No, I got it. I'll come up to bed as soon as I'm done down here. - OK. - OK. - I'm going up. - Good night. - Night. Thank you.

Uh, see you later. - Oh. Bye, sweetie! - Bye! (Engine starting) - Great! Now you can make plans with your father-in-law. He could even come here, or would that be too weird, you know, doing it in your stepson's bed? - Carrie, keep this up, and we will file defamation charges. - The night I saw you, I saw his big, ugly ruby-red ring on his fat old-man finger, and I have the photos to prove it. - Your photos prove nothing. - They may. They may not. I wouldn't test it, though, if I were you. 'Cause wouldn't that be a scandal? One that I doubt Mr. Cooper or your voters would ever forgive you for. (Daniel screaming and crying) - Coming, Daniel! Oh! Ah! Oh! (Grunting) (Dish clattering) home until the morning, OK? be - Why? - Oh, I'm just working a double. - Do you have to? - Just for now. - OK. - Yeah. Uh, oh, there's, uh, frozen pizza for dinner, OK? I'll see you in the morning? - OK. I love you. - I love you. (Chuckling) (Daniel crying) (♪ McGill by Flawless Gretzky playing in distance ♪) (Phone ringing) - Hello? What was that? Yes! Uh-huh.

I thought you were an intruder. - I hardly think calling the police was necessary. - Oh. Like, how you threatened to call the police on me? You'll be lucky if they don't arrest you. - I'm sure once I speak to the police and explain that-- - That you entered through my back door while I was home alone at night? I mean, I was terrified when I heard you. I thought you were gonna kill me. Guess this is just another thing you're gonna have to explain to Mr. Cooper.

But if you change your mind... - OK, thanks. Bye. What gives you the right, Madeline? I just got a call from Gary Ross, who told me that you told him that I want to list my house. - I thought it would help you. I mean, I see you're struggling And I hear it's a great time to sell. You could get well over asking. - I'm struggling, Madeline, because of you. Because God forbid anybody around here does something that you don't like, doesn't mow their lawn or pick up after their dog. And what was it you didn't like that I didn't support? That you wanted to put a gate at the end of the street? - It would give the neighborhood prestige. Who wouldn't want that? And when I'm elected, I'll make sure that it happens. - Well, I mean, if you are gonna make it so prestigious around here, my house value should only go up! I mean, why on earth would I want to sell now? - Maybe because of all the press that's gonna be around once my campaign kicks in?
