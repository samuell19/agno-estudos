You're gonna be okay. You got a favorite song you like to sing? - [Heather] Yeah. - [Ezra] Think you could sing it for me, honey? Can you do that for me, Heather? ♪ London Bridge is falling down ♪ - Good, now you keep singing until I get there, okay? ♪ Falling down, falling down ♪ (window shattering) ♪ London Bridge is falling down ♪ ♪ My fair lady ♪ ♪ Take a key and lock her up ♪ ♪ Lock her up, lock her up ♪ ♪ Take a key and lock her up ♪ - [Ezra] Jesus God. ♪ How will we build it up, build it up, build it up ♪ (baby crying) (light acoustic guitar music) - Better get to work. - Tess? Tess. It'll be all right. (door clicking) (light acoustic guitar music) - [Man] Mind the gap. (sobbing) Mind the gap. (sobbing) Mind the gap. (light orchestral music) - Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. and Mrs. Palmer. This is Grace. Grace, this is Tess and Alfie. They're going to be looking after you. - Hello, Grace. - Hi. - Don't let that little smile of hers fool you. She's a regular tornado, aren't you, buttercup? Heather? Come on, honey. It's all right, come on in. Heather, you remember Tess and Alfie? You remember watching the video they sent you? You remember what you said when you saw it? You said mommy and daddy? Yeah. (giggling) (laughing) - I guess you didn't get our e-mail. Obviously. Um, the passports were more expensive than we originally thought and there were some other unforeseen costs? - [Alfie] Unforeseen costs? - Yeah. - Give me a second with this. - I'm sure you can appreciate that there's no going rate for these things. If you wanted to spread the payments out-- - No, no, no, it's fine, it's fine, we can afford it. Check okay? - [Alvin] Sure. - Their parents are dead? - Their mom, for sure. Murdered. It was a house robbery that went wrong. Although why anyone would think that Jane McGill had anything worth stealing? Except her kiddies of course. - Did they ever catch who did it? - I believe so. What do you say, Nora? - As far as I know. - Father? - Fathers. Heather's father skipped town before she was even born. And Grace's, well, who knows. - This sort of children never come without some sort of baggage, Mrs. Palmer. But I don't have to tell you that. - [Alvin] Do you have any other questions? - No. - Then, if both of you would like to sign here at the bottom, you've got yourself a family. - You don't want to say goodbye? It's easier this way. - Good luck Mrs. Palmer. - [Tess] Thank you. - Good luck. (light orchestral music) - Are those Jane's girls? God bless 'em. - [Tess] Not long now! We're on the second floor. Here we go. This is our flat! - [Alfie] Yay. - [Tess] This way, this way. - [Alfie] Here we go. - [Tess] Gracie! Bit of a mess I'm afraid. - [Alfie] Hey. - It's a new house for us as well as for you! Maybe you could help us paint? - [Alfie] Yeah. - You could pick the colors. I bet you'd like to paint, don't you? Are you a good painter? Bet you make a bit of a mess though! - [Heather] She doesn't like painting. - You must be starving. - I'm sure there's some food in the kitchen, I could make something? - Burgers? - All right then, there's a take away round the corner. - See you in two ticks. - [Heather] Is this to do with your work? - [Tess] Yeah. - What's it mean? - It means I can help children who need helping. - [Heather] Grace wants to see her room now. - All right, want to see your room? Come on then. This way. All the way up to the top and round the corner. - [Grace] Yeah! Let's see. (giggling) - Let me help you with this. - No! Which one's my bed? - Which one would you like? - That one. - You're a mind reader. That's exactly the one I thought. What did you find? Let me see. Ah! Let's show Sally the toys. Sally look, look at this. Sally would you like some toast? - [Grace] Leave some for me. - She doesn't want any toast. Are you gonna wash the toast? (laughing) (light chiming music) That's pretty. - It's my mom's. - I think, maybe Gracie and I should leave you alone for a while to unpack and settle in. Shall we do that Gracie? - Her name's Grace. - [Tess] Would you like to see the garden, Grace? - [Grace] Yeah! - You know, if you need anything, just ask. Come on, missie, I want to show you the garden. You'll love it when you see it. Ready? - [Grace] Sally, where's my Sally? - [Tess] Oh, get Sally, quick. Come on then! Off we go. (dramatic orchestral music) Good girl. That's it, can you bounce it? Can you bounce it? Look at that! Get the ball, this way is the garden. Come on. You're so good at that! I'm coming, I'm gone catch you! (laughing) - [Teacher] We have lots of after school clubs. Art, gym, music. Do you play any musical instrument, Heather? - I'm sure she'd like to learn something. - Hey, Grace, would you like to see where you're going to be when you start school? It's just by the library. Do you like reading? - [Grace] Yeah. - [Teacher] Yeah? What do you like reading, what kind of books? - [Grace] "Cinderella". - [Both] "Cinderella". - [Teacher] I love Cinderella. ♪ London Bridge is falling down ♪ ♪ My fair lady ♪ ♪ Build it up with iron bars, iron bars, iron bars ♪ ♪ Build it up with iron bars, my fair lady ♪ (eerie ambient music) - Okay, speech time! When Tess said she was leaving, my first reaction was, shit! Who's going to give me grief now? (all laughing) Seriously though, I don't know what I'm going to do without her. Yes, she's good at her job. Okay, maybe the best. But you're my mentor. You're my inspiration. And a good friend. As pain in the asses go, Tess, you are the best!

Okay, cereal. What do you fancy, Gracie? - Them! - [Tess] These? - [Heather] She won't eat 'em. - Gracie, will you eat these? She must have changed her mind. - I want Golden Wheats. - What? - I want Golden Wheats. - Okay. Golden Wheats, Golden Wheats, you know what? I don't think they have them. But you could have Wheaties! - I want Golden Wheats. - I'm afraid you can't have any, Heather. - [Heather] Why not? - Because they don't make them here. You'd have to go back to Canada for those. You should try these though. I think these are exactly the same. - I want Golden Wheats. - [Tess] It's just a different name, that's all. - I want Golden Wheats! - Well it's Wheaties or nothing. Okay, what else do we need? Cheese. Gracie, can you help me find the cheese? Shit! Heather? Heather! Stop that, stop that right now! Okay, if you open another packet, you will be in serious trouble. I mean it. - Shit, shit, shit. - Gracie, don't say that darling. Don't say that. Put that back on the shelf. - Shit, shit, shit. - Gracie, you can't say that sweetie! Don't say it please. I won't tell you again. - Her name is Grace. - Fine, that's it! - Get off me! - What? - Don't touch me! I said get off me! - I wasn't going to-- - You're not my mom!

Made of the softest, fluffiest feathers. - Like a bird? - Uh huh. - Does she miss us? - Every day.

You know, Heather was sleepwalking last night. - What? - [Tess] Found her in the kitchen. - Why didn't you wake me up? - [Tess] Why worry you? - Why would I be worried? - I don't know. She's fine. (doorbell buzzing) - That'll be them! - We have to put it on now. It's time to put the dress on. - No! - Yes. - [Grace] No! - Yes. Oh please. - [Grace] No! - Grace? - Thanks. (upbeat music) (singing in foreign language) (vocalizing) - Hi. - Hi. - [Karen] Your garden's gorgeous. - [Tess] Thanks. - It's a bit of a state inside, isn't it? - Now we've only got the one wage coming in we've had to make a few sacrifices. The schools around here are great. - It's ironic. Six months ago you had the perfect family home, but no family. Now you've got the perfect family, but no home. Alfie mentioned their mother was murdered. - Yes. - God! Did they catch who did it? - Yeah. Excuse me a minute. - [Tess] God, your wife. She's only been here two minutes and already she's giving me the third degree. - She is only interested. And she's not my wife. You are! - So you noticed, did you? - Yep. Where's Heather? - She's upstairs. - Is she all right? - Yeah. - Good. - 30 quid for a taxi! - Shit! Eva Braun! - Happy face. - Why on earth you couldn't move somewhere that was at least a bus ride from an underground I will never know! - Hello, mum. - Oh, now where are they? - Just in the garden. - Oh. Plenty of adoption agencies in this country. - That take years to make a decision. - And for good reason. At least you know what you're getting. Why such a hurry? I had to wait ages before I had Alfie. - [Tess] Some of us aren't as blessed as you, Alice. - Well, whichever way you slice it they'll always be someone else's grandchildren. Charlie! - Grandma! - [Alice] How's my favorite grandson! - [Charlie] I'm opening presents with Grace. - [Alfie] Oh here's nana coming! - [Alice] Who's this little fairy? - It's not my fault you've only ever had sex once in your whole life, you vinegary old sow! - Is she still seeing someone? - Doctor Linx. - He's good. Isn't he? - Yeah. - It's not going to happen again. - [Charlie] Where's Heather? - Jesus, Charlie. - If Alfie's my dad, I suppose that makes us brother and sister. We just don't have the same mum. Do you want some gum? See, Tess can't have kids. Her and dad were trying for ages, mum says. Even did that thing called IVF? Then Tess got sick. What happened to your real parents? - I never knew my dad and my mom's dead. - My granddad died of a heart attack. Is that what she died from? - [Heather] No. - How did she die then? - Ah, Thesesa, I'll be off now. - You only just got here. - I did. Such a long way, it'll late before I get home. (Heather screaming) - Stop! (suspenseful orchestral music) Get off! - I told you not to touch my things. - [Charlie] Dad! - [Heather] Stop touching my things! - [Charlie] Dad! - [Alfie] Oh. - [Heather] I told him not to touch it! - I only wanted to have a look! - Give me the scissors, Heather. - It's mine! - I know it is. Just give me the scissors. - She didn't hurt you, did she? - [Tess] There. Hi. Have they got names? - This one's the mom. And this is her daughter. - Mum's looking a little bit shabby there. Maybe we could go out tomorrow and get her some new clothes, huh? - She likes these. - Heather, you know why we asked you to stay in your room this afternoon, don't you? - Because I hurt Charlie. - Sometimes, people do things we don't like. - He touched my bag. - You should have told him not to. - I did. - Then you should have found me or Alfie and told us and we would have told him not to touch it. But you can never, ever, ever attack someone like that, ever. No matter what they might do to upset you. Do you understand me? Listen. I know you're used to things being a little bit different, but here we're going to do things-- - Your way? - Yeah. My way. There's a pizza in the fridge. 10 minutes on 220. - It's a restaurant called Lilly's on the High Street. There you go! - Oh, and chocolate. Grace will swear blind she hasn't had any today but she has, she's had loads. - She has looked after kids before, you know. - I know, I know, just fussing. - Oh come on, they'll be fine! - I'm just going to check on them one more time. - [Alice] You just go off and enjoy yourself. - [Alfie] Thank you, we will! (all chattering) (upbeat music) - [Alfie] Well, I can not remember the last time you and I went out together. - No. It's nice. - Liar. - Just one more call and then I really will be able to relax. - [Alfie] Oh oh oh. Look at you. - [Tess] What? - Relax. - I am relaxed. Valentine's day. - [Alfie] What? - The last time we went out together. - That's right! We spent the whole evening discussing whether we were going to adopt kids in China or the States. - I can do this. - Tenner says you can't. - I'm sorry. It's just-- - What? - Well, she's fine with you but with me-- - [Alfie] Heather? - She hates me. Maybe I'm just being paranoid. - No no no. - Then maybe I'm just not cut out to be a parent. - No come on. You take her to school, you bring her home. When she does something wrong, you there. If she needs disciplining, you're there. It's only natural I'm going to come out of this looking like the good cop. Tell you the truth, I'm a bit jealous. - Maybe. - I mean you're the shrink. But if you ask me, she's only behaving like any kid would who's gone 6,000 miles away from everything she knows. How would you feel? You owe me a tenner. (laughing) (siren wailing) (suspenseful percussive music) - Alice? - What's wrong? - Are you the parents? - [Alfie] Yes, what happened? - Look, I just dropped off for a few minutes. - Oh for God's sake, mum. - [Alice] They can't have gone far. - [Tess] I knew we shouldn't have gone out! - Well, shouldn't you be looking for them? - We've checked all the other flats and notified all available officers in the area. - Heather! - [Officer] Do you have a photograph? - Photograph? - [Officer] It'd help to know who we're looking for. - Well, there's one upstairs, I'll get it. Look, they're Canadian. - [Officer] Canadian? - They're adopted. - Have you been here long? - Just a few weeks. I'll get the photo. - You said you'd looked everywhere ma'am. - Yes. (light orchestral music) - Sorry about that, sorry to waste your time. - [Officer] You'd be surprised how often that happens. I'm just happy they're home. Night Mrs. Palmer. - [Alfie] Thanks. - [Alice] Here you are dear, I made you some coffee. - Oh thanks. - Why didn't you call us? Why did you have to get the police involved? - [Alfie] Tess. - We're not leaving them alone again. - They weren't alone. - I mean it! I waited too long for this and I'm not going to let anyone screw it up! - Hey. Look what I found in the bin. - I don't need them anymore. - Is that what your doctor told you? - I mean, you may not feel ill, you may feel fine. He said that'd happen. The depression doesn't magically go away, you know. - The only reason I was on them in the first place was because I couldn't have kids. - Oh yeah? - But now I've got them. Haven't I? - [Grace] Yeah. - Missed. Now we're in trouble! Hit. Missed! (yelling) (dramatic orchestral music) - What are you doing? That's mine! - She's beautiful. You know, you could put it out. I won't be angry. You could put it on your bedside table and she'll be there every time you wake up. It's okay to miss her, Heather. - I don't. I hate her! I'm glad she's dead! (sobbing) No! - [Heather's Mom] Come here! - [Heather] Get off me! - [Heather's Mom] I said come here! You'll do as I say! - [Heather] Let go of me! I wish you were dead! (eerie ambient music) (moaning) (knocking on door) - [Tess] Heather? Get your stuff. We're leaving in two minutes! - [Alice] It's all right, I'm not staying long. - [Tess] Make sure Grace cleans her teeth properly! - I just wanted to say, it was like you said. She's fine. No harm done. - Why did you call the police? - [Alice] I was worried. - Well, from now on, you don't have to be. 'Cause like you said, they're not your grandchildren, are they? - Does Alfie know? - I told you, we've talked about it. We don't want you looking after them. - That the adoption isn't legal? - Yes. - Oh my goodness, they're so bright! I have to put my sunglasses on! Oh. - [Tess] Come on, Grace. Let's get this jacket on. Can't make Heather late for school. - Is Nana coming? - No. Nana's going home. Let's find my keys, this way. Come on, find my keys.

Thanks for coming. I wanted to speak to you first. Before I brought it up with the Head. - What has she done? - I've had several reports of bullying. A couple of parents have complained. She's a good kid otherwise. She's bright and her class work is not bad by any means. - The displacement a child feels when they move to an alien culture can be very, unsettling. - I appreciate what she's been through Mrs. Palmer-- - Tess. - Tess. I have to consider the welfare of the entire class. - I understand. - If it continues you may have to look at alternative arrangements. Behavioral therapy for example. - I am a trained psychologist. - Oh sorry, right. I forgot. - I'll have a word with her. - Okay, you also might want to have a look at these. It was just an ordinary assignment. Stuff you did in the school holidays. - Thank you. (dramatic orchestral music) - You know, hating you isn't the worst she can do. It's when they don't respond in any way you need to worry. It's a healthy reaction in a traumatized child. Tess, what are you doing? - Since when did you stop smoking? - Day you left. I also joined a gym. She's just testing you, Tess, that's all. Seeing if you're up to the task of being her mother. It's her way of connecting. Maybe the only way she knows? - I know. I know! I can't believe you gave up? - Come back, Tess. Please save me from low calorie shakes and spinning classes. (laughing) Have you talked to Alfie? Why not? - I've wanted this for so long. It's all we've talked about. Sometimes I wonder if it's all we've got in common anymore. Besides, he'd probably tell me I'm being stupid. And he'll probably be right. I deal with this sort of thing all the time. Damaged kids, hundreds of them, I feel like such a failure. - Do you want to hear a radical suggestion? - Maybe you should stop trying to be her psychotherapist. And start being her mum. - Let me see, um, what about, what about Lilly's, you know it? Yeah, the Italian on High Street? That'll be great. See you about one o'clock, yeah? Yeah, okay, thanks, darling. Yeah, yeah, me too. Bye. Hello darling, I didn't see you there. - [Tess] Heather, come on, we'll be late. (light orchestral music) - Where are we going? - [Tess] I thought we'd have an adventure. - [Heather] But what about school? - It'll still be there tomorrow. ♪ Twinkle twinkle little star ♪ ♪ How I wonder what you are ♪ - It's not actually London Bridge. It's called Tower Bridge. Some American guy bought London Bridge. He thought he was getting this one. And he took it brick by brick all the way back to Arizona, I think it was. So what do you fancy for lunch? We could always get pizza? - Pizza! - Come here you! - Can we go to Lilly's? - Lilly's? That's a little bit extravagant for lunch but, why not! Special occasion, right? Can you eat that? Can you eat that big bite? - [Grace] Yeah, watch. - [Tess] Good girl! (laughing) - Does that hurt? - No, no. Do you need help? - How did you do it? - It was an accident. - Charlie said you were sick. - I was unhappy. - My mom was unhappy. - I'm not going to leave you. - That's what Denise said. - Denise? - And the other moms. (dramatic orchestral music) They said they'd look after us. They said we'd be safe. They lied. - We have to go. We have to go. Oh, we're going to have to hurry too. - [Grace] Look at this bit. - It's huge! We have to go, we have to run. Can you get your things together? Come on then, Gracie. - [Grace] Okay. - Good girl. Come on, let's go. - "Very well, Pollyanna, she said at last, "still in that clear voice, so unlike her. "You may. "You may take the jelly to Mr. Pendleton as your own gift, "but understand I do not send it. "Be very sure that he does not think that I do." (laughing) - [Tess] Bed time. - Ahh! Five more minutes. Come on, me amore. - She has to be up early. - Ah right, okay. Night night. Don't let the bed bugs bite. - [Heather] See you in the morning light. Night. - Night. - Night. - Don't think I have to ask what kind of a day you had then. - Maybe we should have got the decorators in. - Yeah, that would have been real cheap, wouldn't it? - I called you this afternoon. - Yeah? Louise never said. - Thought we might go out for lunch? But you'd already gone out. - Yeah. Yeah, I had to show someone around the Woodrow property. D'you want a cup of coffee? - Sure. They'd been adopted before. - What? - Three times according to Heather. - So? - What, don't you think it's a little bit odd? - No, odd-ish, but it's not unusual, is it? - [Tess] No, but-- - I mean, damaged kids like that need a certain type of parent. I'm just lucky to be married to a child psychologist. - Do you ever think we should have waited just a little bit longer? - Look, anybody who says they don't want a perfect kid is a liar. But now that they're here, I can't imagine my life without them. Can you? (dramatic orchestral music) Have you seen the car keys? I think Gracie was playing with them earlier. - No. Going out? - Charlie's parents evening. - Oh right. - Ah! There they are. I'll not be late. - Give my love to Karen. (door clicking) (phone ringing) - Chief Ezra Hyde. - Hi. My name's Tess Palmer. I'm calling from England. - [Ezra] England, eh? How's the weather looking over there? - Wet. - Could do with a bit of rain here. I'm sorry, what can I do you for, Miss? - Palmer. I'm a journalist, I'm doing a piece on the cultural difference between American and Canadian serial killers. - It's going to be a short conversation. - [Tess] Oh? - We don't get many of them around here. - You're lucky. There was a case in the Tribune I think it was. A woman named McGill? - [Ezra] Jane. - You knew her? - Yeah. It was murder all right. But it wasn't anything you'd be interested in. - [Tess] No? - It was a robbery that went wrong. - A robbery? - Yeah, there was money missing, jewelry. The theory is, poor Jane wakes up in the middle of the night to a disturbance downstairs. She puts the kiddies in the closet out of harm's way and heads out to investigate and boom! - Boom? - Hit over the head then stabbed, and her body dragged out into a nearby field. Sorry, this probably isn't helping you any. Listen, you must know a thing or two about roses, you being English and all, right? - What? - [Ezra] I've got some sort of infestation on them. - Did you say she was stabbed? - [Ezra] How's that? - Jane McGill. She was stabbed. - In the neck. - It didn't mention anything about that in the papers. - Well, it wouldn't. Those young 'uns had been through enough without having to read about it in some dirty rag. No offense. - So nobody knew? - Just me and the coroner. Oh and whoever did it of course. - Whoever did it? - We never caught the guy. Listen, uh, what did you say your name was again? - God! (ominous orchestral music) - [Heather] Have I done something wrong? - No. Of course not. - Mum, why don't you come home. The kids would love to see you. - I don't think I'd be very welcome. - Oh, I just think she's over compensating, being overprotective you know. She'll be fine, she'll calm down. - Tess told me about the adoption. If the police find out-- - They won't! It's no big deal. The agency just wasn't registered. The kids are going to be ours in six months legally anyway, regardless, it's just a lot of red tape, that's all. - Why didn't you adopt in this country? - I told you, it takes too long. - I don't believe you. I knew you always were a soft touch. - What? - You let that woman walk all over you. - She does not walk all over me. - Whatever Tess wants, Tess gets. Not content with breaking up a perfectly happy marriage-- - Karen and I were not happy-- - She now wants you to break the law-- - This is our decision, mum. - Look me in the eyes and tell me you really wanted to adopt those children. You see. It's all about her. Me, me, me. - This is not all about her! She tried to kill herself. After the sixth course of treatment failed, it just hit her like a ton of bricks. Well, it hit both of us. I came home one evening, I thought she was asleep. Had a drink downstairs. I went up, I didn't want to wake her up. It was only when I pulled back the sheets... So, that made matters worse, after that there was no way we could adopt in this country. Not with that medical history. - Sorry. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Heather? Heather? Heather! Heather! Heather? (suspenseful orchestral music) - Tess? Are you all right? - [Tess] I'm fine. - What happened? - It was an accident. - [Alfie] An accident? - I wasn't looking where I was going. The platform was packed. - I'm sorry, darling. - It's not your fault. - Yeah, but I love you. - I love you too. - I love you so much! I just love you so much. - It's all right, mommy. Everything's going to be okay. (eerie ambient music) - [Simon] You're frightened of a 10 year old girl? - I was looking at some headlines in the local papers, about her mother's death. They never caught the killer. Then I talked to the Police Chief. - Police Chief? - In Storm Lake, he said she was stabbed but, here's the thing, no-one would have known that. Heather couldn't possibly-- - Tess, what exactly are you trying to tell me? - I was on the underground. Alfie had the car. I could have sworn, it was busy, I was distracted, it could have been the crowd pushing me I suppose? I think she killed her mother. And I think she wants to kill me too. Don't tell me I'm being stupid. You're not there. You don't see what I see. - Have you called the police? You feel this strongly about it, don't you think you should? - I can't. It's not legal, The adoption-- - Christ, Tess! What the bloody hell were you thinking? - If it's not detected in the first six months we can't be held accountable and chances are we'll be able to keep them. - Tess, I know the law! Jesus, we spend half our time dealing with the fallout from these cases! - I just want to be a mother so much. - Okay, let's think about this rationally. This is all new to you. Okay, it's a major life change. It's understandable you should feel a little bit-- - Don't tell me I'm being paranoid! - Tess! Listen to yourself! - She pushed me, Simon! Into the path of an oncoming train! - Really? Do you really believe that? - Oh, for Christ sake! - There's a reason they put you on those tablets, Tess. - I'm not crazy! I should never have come here. - Tess! Tess! Tess! (dramatic orchestral music) - [Tess] Well? - Well, she's clearly a very intelligent young lady. But of course you know it's impossible to come to any kind of conclusion after just one session. Okay, right, you said she sleep walks? - Yes. At least I think she does. - That's a symptom of a stressed mind, it could be the move. Of course she could be suffering from selective amnesia. Unconsciously editing out parts of her life that are too traumatic to revisit. - Like her mother's murder? - Yeah. - So what now? More sessions? Or, I could take her back to where it happened. Force her to relive the experience. - As a last resort, it could do more harm than good. (dramatic orchestral music) Tess, are you sure you want to carry on with this? - We can't help her if we don't know the truth. In your experience, what would make a child want to kill? - Neglect. Abuse. Usual stuff. - [Tess] What if it's none of those things? - That 1% you mean? You hear about them of course but can't say I've ever come across a case myself. - But they do exist, right? - Yeah, no motive, no logical explanation. - Bzzz. So he gave him three wishes and the little bee thought about it. (door clicking) - You were late. - [Tess] Heather had netball practice. - I've just had her school on the phone. Wondering where she's been all day. What's going on, Tess? Tess? - [Tess] Nothing. I'm just helping her, that's all. - By taking her out of school? Disrupting her education? - I took her to see Simon. - Simon? Why? What's wrong with her? Tess? - I think she killed her mother! (laughing) - She's only a child for Christ sake! She's a kid! She's 10 years of age. - That's good of you to notice. - What? - [Tess] Nothing. - If I could spend more time with them, don't you think I would? - [Tess] I know. - I'm working for Christ sake. Trying to keep a roof over our heads. - [Tess] I know! - All right, Tess, what is this about? Come on. - I saw you with Karen! - Well, she's Charlie's mother. - So why lie about it? - All right, so that's it. Now you really have lost it! - This isn't my fault! - Oh yeah? I'm not the one who slashed my bloody wrists, am I! - [Bee] I don't want to fly. I want to a scooter. - [Bee] A scooter. (laughing) (sighing) - I couldn't afford the mortgage so I asked her for a loan. The treatments, the airfares, we sold the apartment at a loss so we could move into this place. I'm maxed out on the plastic. The banks won't return my calls. You think it was easy going to her cup in hand like that? But that's what you do, isn't it? When you want kids. You'll do anything. - You could have told me. - Yeah and you'd have talked me out of it, right? Karen is not the threat here, Tess. It's not working out like we thought, is it? - Are you saying we should send them back? - Look, I'm thinking about it. I do nothing else but think about it, I'm trying to find another solution. - You want us to give up on them because it's costing us money? - If it were only that Tess, but look at you? Look what it's doing to you. Look what it's doing to us. I don't want to have to make this decision between them and us. But if that's what it takes, I'm scared, Tess. Okay, look, it's running now. Here we go. Are you ready? - [Tess] So this is why, this is why we think we'd make really, really good. - [Alfie] Excellent, excellent. - Excellent parents! This is why we think we'd make excellent parents! (laughing) (light orchestral music) (eerie ambient music) You want a response from me? You want some kind of reaction? Well, congratulations lady, you've got one! So now what? Is it because I remind you of her? What did she do to you, what did she do that made you want to kill her? Tell me, tell me! I need to know the truth! Tell me! - Tess! (sobbing) - She was going to hit me. - It's all right, it's all right, darling. - She was going to hit me! - [Alfie] It's okay, it's okay. (sighing) (sobbing) Don't cry. (sobbing) (eerie ambient music) (moaning) - Look, I'm sorry. Let me. - What's going on? - Are you ready? - Yeah. - [Tess] If I take her back to Canada, to where it happened, maybe it'll trigger a memory. - Do you honestly believe that child is capable of killing someone? - I don't want to. Maybe I am paranoid? Maybe I am going mad? But I'm never going to find out if I stay here and pretend everything's fine. - Okay, well I'm the boss, there's no point being the boss unless you can abuse the position. I'll take a week. You don't want me to go, do you? - Who'll look after Grace? - I can't let you do this by yourself. - It's not about you. - What about the police? - They find out the agency isn't registered we'll lose them for good. - Tess, I remember sitting in that hospital, first time the treatment didn't work. I remember watching you lying there drifting in and out of consciousness. I held your hand so tight, I felt so bloody useless. I'd have swapped places with you. I'd have done anything not to see you have to go through all that. Then we had to do it again, and again, and again, and again. And then I nearly lost you. (dramatic orchestral music) I can't let you do this by yourself. - I have to. I have to do it. For me and for Heather. I love you. - I just want you back, Tess. I just want you back. (eerie ambient music) (woman vocalizing) - [Grace] Where's Heather? - What, darling? - Daddy, Heather. Where's Heather? - She's not here, Gracie. No. - Excuse me. - [Woman] Yeah? - Do you know Alvin? - [Woman] Sure, yeah. - You couldn't direct me to his house, could you? (light chiming music) - Heather? - Alvin! (laughing) - Look at you! Nice to see you! - [Tess] And you. - Come on up to the house. Nora's inside. Her file's probably at the office downtown. If you drop by tomorrow I'll get it for you. - [Tess] Thanks, that's very kind of you. - No problem. It must be kind of important to come all this way? - You didn't tell me she'd been adopted before. - Ah. I see. Well, let me ask you something, Mrs. Palmer. Would you have gone ahead with it if you'd known? Here it comes! The finest lemonade in four counties. Served by the finest wife! - Stop it! (laughing) - Did you two never think of having kids? - Oh, but we have. Haven't we, darling? - 112 in nine years. (chuckling) - I guess that's why the good Lord never blessed us with our own. So we could bring some happiness into lives of folks like yourselves. - [Tess] Did you know her mother? - [Nora] Of her. Who didn't 'round here? - No good? - Life dealt her a rough hand. - Is her house close by? - It's about five miles outside of town. No-one bought it after what happened. Folks round here tend to be superstitious about things like that. What are you doing here, Mrs. Palmer? - I need to know what happened that night. Heather says she doesn't remember. But I think she does. She just doesn't know she does. - And by coming here you hope to jog a few memories? - I just thought there maybe something in her file, her past history maybe? - Something the police never saw you mean? I don't doubt your intentions, Mrs. Palmer but sometimes there's a reason a child doesn't remember. - I just want to find out the truth. - What if the truth isn't something you want to hear? - I spoke to the Chief. He said they never caught her killer. But you knew that? - It was easier that way. - Easier? - This is a small town. When a murderer doesn't turn up, fingers tend to point, tongues tend to wag. Heather's just a child. And whatever happened that night, I'm not saying it was deserved, but a child doesn't do something like that with no good reason. Does she? (dramatic orchestral music) Bye, sweetie. - [Heather] Bye. - I'll call you tomorrow. Be in the afternoon, after church. - You're welcome to join us if you like? - Thanks. But we've got a really busy day. - Bye sweetie. - Bye Alvin. (dramatic orchestral music) - I'm gonna warn you, some of the photos in there aren't exactly PG rated. See what I mean? - [Tess] It says here she probably knew her killer? - That is certainly a possibility. - [Tess] And you interviewed all her friends and relatives. - Friends, relatives, drinking buddies, men we knew about, men we didn't. Jane McGill wasn't exactly unpopular if you know what I mean. - So they found the body 100 yards from the house. - The intruder probably wanted to dispose of the body but then panicked, or was disturbed, so just left it there. - Seems so odd that they didn't find anything. - In case you hadn't heard, miss, this is one hell of a big country! You know how many murders go unsolved a year in this province alone? - She had a daughter? - Two. They're somewhere in your neck of the woods I believe. Adopted. So you think this is the work of a serial killer then? - What? - Isn't that what you were writing about? - Oh. I don't know. You'd know more about that than me. - Like I said, it was a robbery. - Is it possible that an eight year old girl could drag a woman's body that far? - What are you suggesting? - It just seems odd, that her killer was never found. - And you think her daughter did it? - What do you think? - After 40 years of policing, nothing would surprise me. Make sure you send me a copy of the story now. - I will. Thanks. (dramatic orchestral music) (phone ringing) - [Denise] Hello. - [Tess] Hi. Can I speak to Denise please? - [Denise] Speaking. - My name's Tess Palmer. You don't know me, but I adopted Heather and Grace McGill and I was wondering if you'd meet me for a coffee or something, just to-- - [Denise] You've got the wrong number. - What? - [Denise] Please don't call here again. (line clicking) (dial tone humming) - I prefer Wheaties. (knocking on door) - You've got a phone call. Phone, for you. - [Tess] How's Grace? - Yeah, yeah, no, no, we're fine, we're fine. She misses her mom. - [Tess] I should go. - Yeah? - I'll call you tomorrow. - [Alfie] I miss you too. (dial tone humming) (phone dialing) - They say everything happens for a reason. Even bad weather. Is that the McGill child? The one who's momma got murdered? - Yes. (wind howling) - Tess Palmer? I'm sorry I was so abrupt on the phone. My husband was around. He'd kill me if he knew I was here. How's she doing? - Good. Do you want to see her? - Best not. What is it they say? Never go back? - How long did you have them for? - A couple of weeks. But it's not the time, you know? That was the hardest day of my life. You wait so long for something and then when you get it. I guess some of us just aren't cut out to be parents? - The agency made it sound like we were the first ones. - [Denise] Well I guess they didn't want to put you off. - What do you mean? - [Denise] You know the stigma troubled kids get. - Is that why you gave them up? - Look, I guess you could argue we knew what we were letting ourselves into but no matter how much you convince yourself you can handle it... I probably shouldn't be saying this and it's probably just me but, Heather? Do you know what happened to her mom? - She was murdered. - What she's been through, the Lord only knows. And I'm not saying it's her fault or anything, but sometimes when you look in those eyes, it's like they're dead or something, like she knows something but she's just not letting us in on the secret, you know? ♪ London Bridge is falling down falling down, falling down ♪ ♪ Falling down ♪ ♪ London Bridge is falling down, my fair lady ♪ ♪ Take a key and lock her up, lock her up, lock her up ♪ ♪ Take a key and lock her up, my fair lady ♪ ♪ How will be building it up ♪ - Heather? Come back to bed, Heather. - [Heather] She couldn't sleep. So I thought I'd sing her a song. Her mommy loved singing her songs. - Why can't she sleep? (dramatic orchestral music) Is she worried about something? - [Heather] She doesn't want to go back to the house tomorrow. She says she's scared. - What is she scared of? - What she might find out. - It should be around here somewhere. We could get her some flowers if you'd like? - Why? (dramatic orchestral music) - What happened that night, Heather? Heather? - I want to go back to the motel. Let go of me! - Not until you tell me what happened. - I don't know what happened! - I don't believe you! - Let go of me! (eerie ambient music) We had an argument. - What about? - I was wearing her jewelry. - What are you doing? - I was just borrowing them. - Little bitch! You know how much this stuff costs? Come here! - Get off me! - [Heather's Mom] You'll do as I say! - Let go of me! I wish you were dead! - She hit you? It wasn't the first time she hit you, was it? Is that why you killed her? - What? - It's all right. - No! No it's not! - I understand, I just want to help you. - I went to bed. I was asleep. - Heather, Heather honey, wake up. Shhh, don't make a sound okay? - I hate her! I'm glad she's dead! Glad! (eerie ambient music) She said she heard a noise. She told me to get up. She told me to stay in the closet. No matter what I was to stay in the closet. - Don't come out. - [Heather] She told me to call the police. - Heather, sweetie, call the police. I'll come back for you, I promise. I'll never leave you, I promise. (glass shattering) - I heard him. (door slamming) (screaming) (sobbing) (screaming) I saw him. (screaming) (sobbing) (screaming) - Do you remember what he looked like? Think, Heather. What did he look like? (eerie ambient music) - I can't remember. Why did she have to leave? She could have stayed! But she didn't! She left us! She made a promise but she didn't keep it. She said she'd never leave us! But she lied! She's a liar! A liar! And I hate her! I hate her! (glass shattering) - [Tess] Heather! Heather! (dramatic orchestral music) - I'm sorry this is taking so long. It's just that Nora usually does this stuff and she's over at her mother's. Are you sure you don't want a popsicle sweetie? - If we could just have her file, we're in a bit of a rush. - Yeah, sure, I just don't know where she would have, oh maybe her briefcase in the kitchen. I'll be right back. - I want to go. - We will. We will. (suspenseful music) - Though why anyone'd ever think Jane McGill would have anything worth stealing? Except her kiddies of course. (urine dripping) (suspenseful orchestral music) - I know. Oh shit, I left my bag in the house. The keys are in it. You just get in the car. Get in the car. I'll be back, I promise. Just get in the car. (phone beeping) Chief? - [Ezra] I can't take your call at the moment. Please leave a message. - [Tess] This is Tess Palmer. I'm over at Alvin's place. You need to get here immediately, please hurry, I can't explain. (woman vocalizing) - Well, it looks like Nora left it in the office after all. I'm sorry to waste your time. Listen, why don't I drag you and Heather into town and we can just pick it up? Where is she? - Bathroom. - Oh right. - I'm sorry to have disturbed you, especially on a Sunday. - [Alvin] No no, it's no disturbance at all. - I'll drive by tomorrow. Thanks. See you later. - Ah, Mrs. Palmer. (suspenseful orchestral music) Mrs. Palmer, Mrs. Palmer! I found the file! I'd lose my head if it wasn't screwed on! (siren wailing) - [Ezra] How you doing, Alvin? - Good. - I'm just passing, in the vicinity so to speak. Thought I'd drop by for some of that homemade lemonade Nora's famous for. - Nora's not here. - Oh. Shame. Mrs. Palmer. - Chief. - If I'm not very much mistaken, is that young miss Heather McGill? I don't want to keep you folks. So I'll just back out so you can be going. You make sure you have a nice day now, Mrs. Palmer. - We will. Thank you. - I'm sorry. I just can't let you go like that. (gun cocking) - What the hell are you doing, Alvin? - They know. - I know they know! What the hell do you think I'm doing here? She called me! - You? You killed-- - No. There's no blood on my hands. - But you knew about it? All those files in there, children whose parents had died, murdered by him. And you knew about it. - They were better off without them! You know how many reports I had of that young 'un's mother beating her up? That trailer trash waste of God's given breath never should have been able to have kids anyway! Isn't it best they're with parents like yourself who love them, who cherish them? Don't take them for granted? Don't beat the living hell out of 'em at any opportunity? - I think we've done nothing but good. - For yourselves maybe. With all the money you made in the process. (suspenseful orchestral music) (gun firing) (groaning) (gun firing) - Get up, Mrs. Palmer. Get up! You. Out of the car. 'Round the back. (suspenseful orchestral music) Throw those keys up here. Right, now, if you do as I say, this will be quick and painless. Turn around sweetheart. Turn around. Turn around, damn it! (gun firing) (screaming) (groaning) (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Tess] Come on! - Oh my God, we have to go back. No, no. (groaning) - Shhhh! - No, please. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Shhh. - No. (gun firing) (screaming) (gun firing) (groaning) - If you hurt my daughter, I will kill you! - Stop please. No more, stop it, please. No more, no more, no more, please, stop. - Alvin? Alvin? Help him, help him! (dramatic orchestral music) - It's over. It's over. - No. (sobbing) - [Officer] Your name's Tess Palmer. Is that correct? Ma'am? Who are you ma'am? - I'm her mother. - [Grace] Heather! - Tess! (light orchestral music) Tess, oh darling. - I thought I'd lost you. - No, no. - It's time to go. - You didn't leave me. - I never will. (light orchestral music)
