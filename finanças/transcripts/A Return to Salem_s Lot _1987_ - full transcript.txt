(dramatic music) (dramatic music) (man crying out) (dramatic music) Joe, they're killing him. Purifying him. But you said this was supposed to be a fertility ritual. It is, he knocked up the chief's favorite wife. I didn't come here to film a circumcision. This has never been recorded before, zoom in on him. Give me the fuckin' camera. (dramatic music) Now don't be stupid, get your hand off that gun. Try not to show any emotion. It's their society, their rules. Think how they'd feel about our gas chamber in San Quentin. You're a cold-blooded son of a bitch. You're not even human. (guns firing) (guns firing) (people screaming) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (man laughs) I'm sorry to chase off all of that bare titty. What's the matter? It took me weeks to get next to this tribe and you come here and screw everything up. You have a son back in the states, Jeremy? What's happened? A major emergency, I'm afraid, I'm sorry. Is he? We don't know, but your wife is sending frantic telegrams. My ex-wife. (engine rumbling) I didn't know you had a son. How come you never said anything about him? (engine rumbling) Can't this damn thing go any faster? I hope he's nothing like you pal. You got something in your eye. What? Here. Watch the camera. (man crying out) (dramatic music) Of course I'm coming back. Nothing's more important. What? Sally, thank you for letting me know. Well, well, well, the son of a bitch is half human after all. (engine rumbling) Joe, I'd like you to meet my husband Allen. Yeah, sure, hello. How's Jeremy, is he conscious? What's the matter? I'm afraid Sally exaggerated the situation somehow. I had to get you back up here, Joe. How could you pull this kind of bullshit stunt on me? I was doing definitive work on those tribes. We tried, but we can't get through to him. The boy's deeply disturbed, Joe. It's either you or commitment to a psychiatric hospital for at least six months. Your choice. Sure, dump him in a mental ward. A ward, it's a very fine hospital that specializes in teenagers. Who dumped who? You haven't even seen Jeremy in three years. Where the hell is he? You're the big father figure around here. And you can't even recognize him. Go ahead. Find him. There he is. The kid in designer clothes, right? Only you would put him in an outfit like that. How you doing, son? Didn't they just tell you? I'm fucked up. (engine rumbling) So now what? Give me five minutes to adjust to civilization, okay? I got a job offer in Peru. You wouldn't want to go to Peru, would you? Look, does it matter what I want? Then there's Maine. The Boondock. There's a little town's so small it's not even on most maps. Sounds hot. You want a cab? Maybe you don't, but I do. Bring the rest of them. (dramatic music) This aunt of mine, did I ever mention her to you? [Jeremy] I don't remember you mentioning anything. [Joe] She left me this Bungalow. It can't be worth anything. Because when your mother was marrying that accountant, what's his name? [Jeremy] Frank. [Joe] Right, Frank. She left it to me as part of the divorce settlement, so it's got to be a dump. (dramatic music) By the time we pay that cab fare, we could buy a car. I knew, I knew you were going to stop at this car. She is a beauty, a beauty. How much is it? What it says, 1,500. That's the blue book. For this pile of shit? Look at this, look! I like this kid. I like this kid a lot. Listen, the boss, next week he's going to lower this price to 1,200. But I think today I can give you a break. That's the best I can do. Some break, look, this things gonna need a couple 100 bucks worth of tires pretty soon. You're very mechanically minded, you're a very smart kid. Take it for 1,000. Exhaust system corroded to hell. Yeah, yeah, I noticed that to. I meant to write that down, thank you. 800, please? What do you say, boss? [Jeremy] I don't care. After I drive it, we'll negotiate. Negotiate? We already negotiated. Before I drive it, he negotiates. After I drive, I negotiate. See how it runs. Please run. (light hearted music) (engine rumbling) Anyway, it's called Salem's Lot. It used to be called Jerusalem's Lot, but the natives, they shortened it. Jeremy, I want you to put that cigarette out. Don't do that. Fuck you! You're not my father anymore than the other three or four clowns that've been hanging around. I liked some of those guys better than I like you. I can take the criticism, but leave out the fuck you, okay? Shit, how I hate being a fuckin' kid, always being shuffled around. I just wish I was grown up already. [Joe] Are you good for anything but swearing and smoking? You know how to drive? Sure. That's one thing I did, stole Allen's Mercedes. I spent spent a little time here with Aunt Clara at Salem's Lot. Wasn't long, just a couple days but I'll never forget it. There was this girl, she was older than I was. She was 17. My Aunt Clara, she sensed something was happening, so she put me on the train back. She's not really my aunt. She's a friend of the family. She was nice. I'll bet you that's why she gave me this house, to make up to me for all that. [Jeremy] Maybe she had nobody else to leave it to. Yeah, that's possible. Well, you got us here. (ominous music) 10 gallons unleaded. We're all out of unleaded. Any sodas, any coke? All out of that, too. That figures. Aren't there any kids around here? The old school looked in pretty good shape. The historical society keeps that up. We like to keep things just the way they were. Say, friend, the old Hooper house, is that on the hill? Behind the school on the overlook? Yes, no, maybe? See you around, neighbor. Around, around what? Yeah, around, you and I could have long discussions. We'll have heated debates deep into the night. (eerie music) Nice talking with you. (engine rumbling) [Woman] He's come back. [Man] Joseph has come back. He's brought us his boy. [Woman] All grown up now. [Man] A man. [Man] Clara's boy. [Man] A man now. [Man] Joseph and his son. [Man] Joseph brought a son. (eerie music) [Joe] This house is over 100 years old, still standing. [Jeremy] Barely. Watch your step. Look at those nice house down there. Why couldn't we have got a nice house? This will be nice house, when we fix it up. (door thuds) I'm not going in there. [Joe] Kid's right, it's a dump. What did I get us into? Thanks a lot, Aunt Clara. Dad! Dad! Can you use your hands? Carpentry, painting, stuff like that? Shit, I knew it. Slave labor. Shit, assholes. Don't tell them that to their face. [Jeremy] What have we done now? Or what have you done? (eerie music) You folks got business around here? What do you care? Jeremy, I'll do the talking. You go on down to main street, check out the school. You mean get lost. That's right, I'll see you in an hour. This is my house, sir, it was deeded to me in my aunts Will. You got proof? Sure. Got it here somewhere. There you go, Sheriff. Constable. Constable Rains. Not planning to sleep in there, are you? How about my deed? I'll hang onto this, show it to the judge. You got a judge here? I thought this was a small town. You can get this document back from Judge Axel personally. That's the big white house on the end of main street. (sheep bleating) (eerie music) (eerie music) [Man] He's here, Jeremy's here. He's going to stay with us, he's going to stay. (eerie music) (voice whispering) He belongs to us, he belongs to us. (eerie music) (voice whispering) (eerie music) What are you doing here, boy? (suspenseful music) This town sucks. (dramatic music) [Man] 5R30. Correction, 5R34, 10-82 (rock music) Okay kiddies, turn off the ignition. Get out of the car, give me the keys. What did we do? Come on, all right, let's go. We didn't do anything. Come on, man. Let's go, let's go. You kids ought to know better than to be speeding around Jerusalem's Lot at night. You mean Salem's Lot. Don't ever go to Salem's Lot. Don't ever go to Salem's Lot. Salem's Lot, an evil place. Shut up, Sherry, man you're making it worse. Shut up will ya? Shut up. Evil place. Shut up! Are you making fun of our town? I said, are you making fun of our town? (eerie music) Just give us the ticket and we'll get out of here? I'm afraid we can't let you go. Tonight's a holiday, we're celebrating. Yeah, looks like a fuckin' party. We got to teach them some respect. [Woman] What are you doing? [Man] Get out. [Woman] Get away. What are you doing man, get away from us. (man screaming) (dramatic music) (both screaming) (dramatic music) No, no! Stop! Listen to me, listen to me. Your only chance is to make it to the church. They can't follow you in there, you understand? When they go away, go to that cottage on top of the hill. They'll help, you understand? (dramatic music) (woman screaming) No please! Please, no, lady please don't, stop! What are you doing to me no! No! Oh God no! (woman screaming) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (woman screams) (eerie music) Help me? Isn't there anybody here to help me? (eerie music) God. God, please, God. Please don't let them kill me. (dramatic music) Please make them go away. She'll go to Clara's cottage. Yep. Just like Judge Axel wants her to do. Wipe your mouth. Hey! Hey! Goddamn it! That's my Jack Daniel's. Yours, it's half mine, you dumb son of a. (kids laughing) Girls. Come here, girls. Come here. What are you doing out at this hour of night. Come by the fire. Why are you giggling, what's so funny? You don't like the cut of our duds? Come closer girls, I'll show you how funny we really are. Look, they brought some, hey. Look at that, they brought some protection. What are you laughing at? What's so funny. Hey, Louie, look at their eyes. I think they're retarded Louie. They're not retarded, they're disturbed. Disturbed, hey, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing, don't put me in front of there. What am I gonna do? Get back, get back kids. Go on home, get out of here. If they get any closer I'm gonna smack 'em. Oh yeah, smack 'em, hit a kid and go to jail. (men screaming) (dramatic music) What is that? (eerie music) (kids laughing) (eerie music) This town is weird. Where did I put that lantern? Scared me, too. Help me, help me please! Please, help me! Settle down, what is it? What happened? Oh, thank God it's you! What happened? You're not going to believe me! You'd be surprised what I'd believe. Here, sit down here. Jeremy, get her a glass of water. They grabbed them, and they killed them. There was blood. (woman cries) Shit, she is majorly stoned. They're dead. I know, but something happened to her. Go get some hot water and towels. Now, Jeremy! Okay, okay. Now, tell me what happened. They killed him! They pulled him out of the car and killed him. Who killed him? The town, the whole town, everybody in the town! I know you think I'm crazy, but it's true. [Joe] That's Judge Axel's house at the end of main. He'll listen to you. Jeremy, knock on the door. (door knocks) Now, take it easy, you're going to tell your story to the judge. Sorry to disturb you so late, but it's an emergency. I'm Joe Weber, Clara's nephew. Something's come up regarding your constable. No bother, no bother at all, you're always welcome. Come on in. And the curiously dressed young woman, you step in, too. Martha's in the kitchen taking care of the dessert. This is our town physician, Dr. Fenton, Mrs. Fenton, and their lovely granddaughter Amanda. My, my, my. Oh, my poor child. Goodness. Why, she's trembling like a leaf. Oh dear, doctor, I think she has a fever, I do. Come here, sit down. Let's have a look at you. That's it, sit right there. From the look in the eyes, I'd say she's been partaking illegal substances, and not too long ago. She's incoherent, all the same, she claims she was attacked by your local constable among others. That degenerate, Rains? Wouldn't be the first time. Axel, the children. Oh yes, we shouldn't talk about such sordid... Pardon me judge. Amanda, dear, would you take the lad down to town hall? Maybe he's never seen a wedding. Of course, Grandfather. I'd love to. What wedding? It's just a small family gathering. I'm certain the boy would be very welcome. He's a dear boy. It'll be all right, Dad. I'll be fine. No! Don't let them go out there alone! Young lady, you must compose yourself. And try to start making some sense. You're silly. I'm so sorry. Yes, I do feel safe here. I guess I was dreaming part of it. I remember, we were in the car. I told them to stay off the road to Salem's Lot. Easy girl, easy now. But they wouldn't listen! Your favorite. It's her! She's one of them, the ones trying to kill my friends! Sherry, now just calm down. They're trying to help you. Let me go! [Joe] Easy, Sherry, they're not gonna hurt you. He's a doctor. (Sherry screaming) (eerie music) Leave her alone! She's ours now. [Axel] There's nothing more you can do for her, Joe. They're killing her in there, aren't they? Something like that. You recognized your aunt. Clara. One of us. One of what? You still haven't figured it out, have you, Joe? Mr. Professional Anthropologist. You have run across the oldest race in humanity, nestled here quietly amid the folks, protected by a skepticism that says they don't exist. Vampires. Speak it again, Joe. Vampires! It's easier if you speak it. What have you done with Jeremy? (Axel chuckles) (Sherry screaming) (dramatic music) Since when do vampires need guns? Just for show. (gun clicks) This gun probably hasn't been fired in over 100 years. Contemporary people seem to understand guns now a days, more than anything else. I understand a girl's been murdered. Let's go look for your son. (eerie music) You've seen more than most people. You've traveled through a world of starvation, war, and killing for profit. Do you think that that world is any better than ours? You son of a bitch. If you didn't have my son, I'd kick your fuckin's ass around this town until you couldn't suck orange juice. (eerie music) Jeremy! (dramatic music) [Man] Sustaining, and being sustained. (dramatic music) We're all dairy farmers in these parts. You outsiders grow stock for meat. We grow them for blood. See, human blood is still the best, but the way things are going nowadays it's not quite good for you, what with drugs, alcohol, hepatitis and this AIDs virus going around. Then why go after people? Oh, tonight's a wedding. It's kind of like a holiday for us. Judge lest us kick up our heels in tribute to past ways. When blood was good and pure. Course, Jersey cows give thicker, richer milk. And richer blood, too. I've seen enough cows, I want to see my son. In good time. Don't be scared. Who's scared? Come, join us. What a shame, all that going to waste. (eerie music) You clean up pretty quickly after a killing, don't you? See the missis there chopping garlic? That should dispel one of the myths about us, and garlic. (eerie music) Looky here. In this mirror. My reflection is clear as yours. It sounds to me like you want me to write all this down. Yes, sir, young man, a true chronicle. For who to read? Oh, we don't expect this to go public for 200 years. But write by someone with all the proper qualifications, a somebody in his own time, my boy. I'm the same person you loved when you were a little boy. Were you one of them even then? You took comfort in my arms all the same. Yes, I did. I recall it as being the happiest time of my childhood. You could write something real important. You could change the way outsiders feel about us forever. A history? A bible. See, you have what they call credibility. It's your profession to set down the ways of odd cultures. You go on murdering passers-by, and I'm an accomplice? Yes, that's, that's odd. I've been explaining to you that our appetite doesn't extend to human prey, excepting now and again. Axel, can't you see his mind is on the youngster? He's worried sick about the boy. Well, then, we'll just have to set his mind to rest. (kids chattering) (gentle music) Don't you guys ever sleep around here? I mean, don't you even get tired? No, I get enough sleep. (gentle music) There, you see, Joseph? There's your Jeremy running happily with his newfound friends. Dad! Dad! Just as safe as at home. And just as happy as you were as a boy. (eerie music) [Girl] I'll get you! I have someone who will put your fears to rest, someone who's been waiting for your arrival, waiting patient. (gentle music) [Girl] Joey. (gentle music) I've been waiting for you, my Joey. (eerie music) I'd be happy if you could just be Joey again for me. (eerie music) I think he's very cute. Now, don't start that again. Stop it, he belongs to Cathy. [Cathy] I stayed the same, Joey. I waited for you, and I wanted to stay just as you remembered me. I was 17, Joey. You were only 14, too young, but I love you, Joey. So I waited. I knew you'd come back to me. (gentle music) He's been ours since he was born, you know. [Mrs. Axel] I don't trust him, he'll betray us. I won't take his soul. He must give it willingly. You just want to find out if any human can love us. If he loves us, he'll be my successor. If not, I'll send his soul straight to Hell. Good day, dear. Good day. (eerie music) Jeremy! Jeremy! Walk slowly, just act calm. I am calm. Get in the car. If we keep going to the end of the road, we'll be on the highway and we won't stop. Run, why run? You know these people aren't human. You know what they are? They don't wanna kill us. They could have done that already. And if they don't kill us, what else is there? Has somebody been getting into your head? That girl? Let's just go home dad, let's finish the house like you promised. I want you to shut up. Where were you all night? Sure as hell didn't come looking for me. I told you to keep quiet. What's wrong with you? You want me to drive? No. (eerie music) What's the matter with me, what's the matter with me? Did they give you something to take? [Jeremy] No, I'm not on anything. They're against drugs. (eerie music) I've been taken into a closed society, offered the secrets of what may be the oldest and most despised race on Earth, and I've found them here. Not in some distant Slavic mountain country, but as Americans. I know they have killed for centuries, and I'm certain my life and my son's life doesn't mean a thing to them, but they want a bible. Ow! Shit. So what's on your mind? Not what you think. Jeremy, have you. Did you get laid last night? Who me? I'm just a kid. Did you? You don't sleep, you have this energy all of a suddenly. You can't wait till dark, can you? They're all right. At least they don't turn into bats like those bullshit stories. I've come across lots of vampire bats up along the Orinoco River. Them I could kill. I don't like things that suck your blood and have conversations afterwards. Don't stay on my account. I'll be in good hands. Oh, please, get to work. (eerie music) I want you to come to school tonight. They asked me to bring you along. Oh. Open school night, huh? Bring your tape recorder, too. What are you now, my research assistant? You wanted us to do things together. Well, here's our chance. (eerie music) It's our feeding time, Joseph. These cows can replace this blood in a weeks time, and we can feed again. (eerie music) Jeremy, go on to the school. I'll catch up with you. More kindly than butchering them, the way you outsiders do. (eerie music) Although I must confess I prefer human blood. Axel says I have a drinking problem. (eerie music) Who's this? I'll find out. Can I help you? I thought you needed help. That's why I stopped. Where are you going? It depends where the hell I am right now. [Joe] You're in Salem's Lot. Well, maybe you can help me. I'm looking for a friend of mine. Kesserling is his name. You recognize him? No. How about looking at the picture first mister? Still no. You got a headlight out. Yeah, I know it, you know it. The damn car doesn't know it. He speaks dutch. Do you know this face, young fellow? Dutch. I wouldn't know how a dutch accent sounds. Let's go, Dad, come on. Is something up at this hour of the night here? They usually roll up the sidewalks at ten o'clock at night in these towns. It's a special occasion. Do you need any directions? No, no, thanks a lot. You're very kind. Now be careful. I go by instincts. I'm a lousy driver, hell of a lousy driver. I'm going to get killed like this one day. Be careful. (engine rumbling) You're lucky. You don't know how lucky. (engine rumbling) See what happens when you get old? [Kids] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. We have some visitors who are new to our town, so, shall we review the year and circumstance that brought us to this new land? It was 1620. Not the Mayflower, the other ship which everybody thought had sunk. No shouting. Yes, Amanda. The ship was the Speedwell. We thought it best that others should believe we perished at sea. We knew what to expect from those pilgrims. Puritans, they called themselves. Hypocrites, I call them. So we lit out on our own. Like Rodger Williams did for Road Island. We came here in secret. Far from witch-trials, far from persecutions, far from crazy mobs driving stakes through our hearts. 300 years of this? So you see vampires are forever. Do you have a question, Jeremy? I don't get this. Who are all those people hanging out during the day, you know, running the shops and the stores? Drones. Shh. Where do they come from? We breed them for service, just like we breed cattle for blood. I don't like them, they make me nervous. They don't like being called Drones. Again, it's that derogatory word that we do not encourage in the classroom. Uh, turn to your page 135 in the text, the Spanish inquisition, the brutality of man. I guess they have no sex education here, huh? Let's go. [Teacher] Thousands of people were killed. [Joe] Come on, Jeremy. [Teacher] People perished for their beliefs. [Girl] Spanish inquisition, ecclesiastical tribunal... (eerie music) I can't wait. I don't want to go. I want to stay and hear the rest. Jeremy, it's not good for you. Let Jeremy stay. There's still so much to learn. It's bullshit, it's antihuman propaganda. The boy has a mind like yours, inquisitive and skeptical. Please, Dad? I have a carriage outside. You and I can ride to Miller's pond. Do you promise me you won't go back in that classroom and that you'll go home right now? Okay, I promise. Jeremy? If you're still out there, why don't you come back in? We'd love to have you. (dramatic music) It's not far, Joey. Remember how we came here when you were a little boy? Always at night like this. (eerie music) (Jeremy laughing) Jeremy, what is happening to you? You know. Know what? Don't play games with me. Okay, I've decided. You can't spend the rest of your life in this body of a child. No, a man. To outsiders, I'll be trusted like a child, but I'll be as cunning as a man. I'll serve better in the image of a child. Serve? Be a slave, you mean. Slave, who's the slave? I didn't see you run away the first night. You're the one who wants to write their bible. All right, I'm an ambitious asshole. You said so yourself. We're both caught. (eerie music) Dad, I can't sleep. The sunlight hurts my eyes. You want an aspirin? I have to do it. The pain won't go away until I do it. I know. I know. (eerie music) (Jeremy whimpering) (eerie music) Amanda, no. No, not yet. [Joe] Here, Jeremy. I hope it gets dark soon. It will. (gentle music) It's going to be all right, gonna be all right. (suspenseful music) Stop, stop! Go back! Let us go. Why don't you let us go? I'll kill you, you bastard! (water splashing) (whacks) (cries out) (water splashing) (whacking) (dramatic music) (water splashing) [Jeremy] Leave me alone! Dad, help me! Come on now, you're not hurt that badly. Just a few bumps and bruises. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you. Leave him alone. Well, Joe. You've gone and killed Abner Pepper. You took that poor drone's life during his 29th year. Please, don't take it out on Jeremy. It was all my idea to run. It appears, Joseph, that young Jeremy is about to have a little brother or sister to keep him company. Is that so, Catherine? Yes, Mrs. Axel, our child. He'll grow up to love and serve us all his life. He'll protect our graves. No, that can't happen, no that can't. You'll love our baby, I know you will. You bastard. You worked this all out to bind me to you by blood. Little Jeremy's down at the schoolhouse taking his vows. Soon he'll be reborn. Dead! What he'll be is dead! Why do you make it sound so all-fired awful? It's no worse than a boy having his tonsils taken out. You took a boy away from us, and now you're giving us a boy back. You bitch. You sons of bitches. (whacks) (cries out) Now you give me my son now. You gave your word you'd take no human blood. That I did. If you take my son's blood, you'll have no hold over me, I'll kill you, you'll have to kill me, I swear to God. Joe, you've set yourself a good bargaining position. [Woman] I'm hardly interested. Mind you, this little ritual can be completed if you don't hold up your end to the letter. Don't worry, don't worry, I'll keep my side of the bargain. I'll write your bible. So be it. I think that young Jeremy should be living separately from you for a spell. Where? Well, never mind. He'll be under my personal protection. Discomfortable cousin, knowest thou not that when the searching eye of heaven lights up the sphere that lights the lower world, that thieves and murderers range abroad unseen? Research material. Be careful of the pages, they crumble very easily. Get busy. Where did all this money come from? We're very wealthy people, Joseph. Can you imagine how rich you'd be if you'd get to live 300 years? Just real estate alone. We own land on the Boston common. We have property all the way up through Maine and New Hampshire. Why, vampire life and financial security go together. And not a penny from the government. Constable, I'd like to talk with you. I got nothin' to say to you. Well maybe you don't know, but I've been asked to write a kind of bible about your people. Why didn't you just leave when you had the chance? Why do you say that, you're one of them, aren't you? Or you're half one of them. Axel's my grandfather, but I'm dirt to him. I'm just someone to protect him when he sleeps. Then why don't you run off? To where? To your world? There's nothing out there for me. Axel, aside from being what he is, doesn't seem all that bad. Axel lets you see what he wants you to see. I saw him once when he was angered, when he lost control. I saw his true face. (eerie music) Jeremy! Jeremy! Jeremy! (eerie music) Give me my son back! (eerie music) Clarence! Clarence! Clarence, you must have seen Jeremy. Where do they keep him during the day? Now, now, now, that's not for you to trouble about. But I'm doing what I'm told. I'm writing till my hand is paralyzed. Why can't I see him? And you, you don't have any feelings about this. Are you a human being? Do you have any thoughts, any feelings? You know you should be nice to me because your little baby's gonna grow up to be just like me. It's okay to hit us drones. That's what we're here for. (eerie music) Ooh, tourists. I hate tourists. My friend Kesserling said he came through here and bought your best Hepplewhite. Look at his face, don't tell me Carl here isn't a customer of yours, a regular customer. Yep, I'm telling you that. You know, always the best merchandise is kept in the cellars. Can I take a peek down there please? We're closing. You want me to leave? Yes, right now. All right. All right. I'd give my right ball to have such working hours. Uh, mister, you still not lost? Oh, I remember you. Don't tell me this is the same town. What's it called? Jerusalem's Lot. Mm-hmm. You said Salem's Lot, that's what you said. Same place. Well, I got lost. You know that ridiculous feeling of being helpless? Are you still flashing that picture on everybody? Would like to take another look at it? Say, you know, see that police car? Couple times it circled around here. Keeps looking at me. He likes to give out tickets, so I'd run along if I were you. Well, my glasses. Wait a minute, I can't drive without glasses. Hey, open up! You got my God damn glasses! It's getting very late, why don't you stay at my place? It wouldn't be an imposition? [Joe] No, not at all. Do you want me to drive? It's a necessity, I believe. (light hearted music) (engine rumbling) Go away. Well I'm going to turn in, Mr. Van Meer. If you need anything, you just holler, all right? Okay, Joe, good night. I'll be up soon. (gentle music) (eerie music) You. What do you want, Sonny? Listen, I have to tell you. Well, so tell me. That guy that you're looking for? Yes? Well there's a school teacher at my school who looks like him. You sure? You're really sure, now? Huh? Uh-huh. Okay. Take a good look. Take a good look. Is that the man? That's him, but with less hair. That's good. You're on the ball. Very good. Well, he's still down at the school. At this hour? What the hell's he doing at school? Well he sleeps in the school building. Why did they let you go? What's going on here, what's wrong? You keep out of this. Jeremy, you're trying to lure him down there to get killed, aren't you? Don't worry about me. I don't die easily. Glasses or no glasses mister, if I were you, I'd get the hell out of here. You seem to be a nice fellow, Joe. Why in the hell would you protect a nazi? A what? A nazi. [Joe] A nazi? Yes damn it, admit it, now that's Kesserling. A nazi? Yeah. In Salem's Lot? Yep. You know, even a nazi would have enough sense not to hang around Salem's Lot. (suspenseful music) Then what the hell is all this secrecy about? What the hell's going on in this town? Shut up! Just shut the fuck up! And you, you go away! What a rude boy, talking to his father like that, and in front of company! He's not himself, mister. You. Can you read this without your glasses? Yeah. Yeah, my vision is improving. I figured it would. Ah. Look at me, look at me. Try what I'm doing. It gets their attention. Wash his mouth out with soap. Now you sit down. Say uncle! Say uncle! [Jeremy] Uncle! Okay, now you stay put! Hear me? Goddamn kids. Hate these little puppies, coming around when I'm trying to concentrate. Joe, you trying to give me nightmares? Keep reading. Where did you grab him? Right there? Ah, ow, ow! Hey, that works. Now are you going to sit down? All right, okay. Okay. Just leave me alone. Okay, fine. (dramatic music) Well, what do you think? Nobody believes in vampires. Don't believe any of it! He hates everybody in town because they're my friends. He doesn't want anyone to like me. You know, the pages I doubted at first, but you convinced me. We've got a great opportunity here, my boy. Now let's go. (suspenseful music) Make a right turn onto the main road, don't stop till we hit Bangor. I said a right turn, you're going back there. I know what the hell I'm doing. I'm a dutch jew, but my mother was Romanian. Half my childhood I spent in the Carpathian mountains, and in the villages where all the tales have passed, along with the goddamn remedies. A church in Salem's Lot? You mean a museum. They keep it there for appearances for the passers by. Doesn't make a damn bit of difference, as long as nobody desanctified it, it's a sanctuary. We'll barricade ourselves in. And in the morning, right after sun up, we'll attack get those son of a bitches while they're asleep in the coffins. Attack them ourselves? Jeremy, you know where the hell those coffins are hidden, all of them. You're not gonna get much help out of him. We'll see if he's more scared of them or me. We still got the constable and the rest of those hybrids to deal with. I'm used to dealing with those son of a bitches that made a deal with the devil. You see that? Took this off a goddamn SS Colonel Hineigim, Argentina, '52. How many of those did you arrest? None, when I find them, I shoot them. That cuts through all the red tape. I'm not a nazi hunter. I'm a nazi killer. (dramatic music) I told you I was a lousy driver. He got back up. (dramatic music) This could cost me a whole New Windshield. (gun fires) Shit, they're ugly. (dramatic music) Not tidy. But the alter has not been desanctified. All those legends are not bullshit. We'll be safe here. We got a lot of hard work to do tonight. (siren blaring) What's that? (engine rumbling) (suspenseful music) Oh, no. It's the short-line bus. They've diverted it to the center of town. (suspenseful music) Hi, folks. Don't be alarmed. Welcome to Salem's Lot. I'm Judge Axel, and there's been an accident. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to ask you people to leave the bus and answer a few questions, names, addresses, and all that, and you may leave your personal belongings in the bus because you'll be right back. [Man] I should have taken the train. [Man] Shit, stuck in a dead town like this. You broke your solemn vow, Joseph! Released me from my promise, released us to seek human blood again! Jeremy, I don't want you to look at this. No, let him look. Let him look. (dramatic music) (people screaming) (dramatic music) They sleep in the basement of their homes. Not the children. They sleep under the school. Well, thank you. My coffin's there, too. So what are you thinking of right this second? The way those poor people sounded when they were being killed. What else? I don't know. The smell, the funny smell inside that coffin, the dampness. Disenchantment has set in. Dad, I'm scared. Jesus, I'm scared. That's a good sign. Here. Shave that tip. Judge Axel first, then the rest. There's too many of them. We can't kill the whole town. I've seen bigger towns wiped out before. Towns with nice, harmless people, so I know it can be done. (ax banging) (suspenseful music) (hammer thuds) (suspenseful music) Mr. Van Meer, wake up. We overslept. We lost half the day. How could we have slept so long? Somebody must have put the hex on us. We shouldn't have looked into the judge's eyes last night. It's too late. We don't have enough time now. The hell we don't. Wake the boy, let's move out. Jeremy? Jeremy, wake up. Jeremy, we've got to go, but I want you to stay here. I can help. You can help more by staying inside. Make them believe that we're still here. Move around in front of the windows, make yourself seen. We've only got the constable and the deputy to take care of. What about Cathy? Who is Cathy? She's, uh, one of them. She's pregnant, and it's my child. No wonder you failed to tell me about it, that girl. Can you handle her? You stay in this church, and stay put. You're safe here. You understand, don't move out of here. (suspenseful music) Careful, don't spill that holy water. Good, he thinks we're afraid to come out. Get back in there, close the window. That's what he wants us to believe he thinks. What do you say, that way? Yeah. Let's move. (suspenseful music) Uh-huh. (suspenseful music) (vampire hisses) (eerie music) Open the drapes. This is your wake-up call, your honor. Shit, we've been had! And ten to one, we'll be had again! Look at that goddamn thing. (suspenseful music) (vampire cries out) (eerie music) And I thought I'd seen everything. (eerie music) Murderers! Now it's your turn to go straight to hell! (Van screams) Joe! (gun fires) What grabbed you? Not a damn thing, but it looked good. (gun firing) You hold it right there! (guns firing) Why couldn't I go? I could have helped them. (gentle music) Amanda, you can't be out here in daylight. You'll die. I'm not gonna die, and neither are you. If you come now, we can live forever. (suspenseful music) And he sleeps in a box. That won't do any good. Sure as hell won't do any harm. (gun fires) (vampire screaming) (stake cracking) (suspenseful music) Mr. Van Meer? We've got another one, Joe. Would you come here? What's up? I need your help. Be right with you. (eerie music) What is it, Joe? Mr. Van Meer, she's here, this is her house and I can't do this. That's not a baby. This is not a human. Now we've got work to do, and don't you dare buckle right now. Go on. I'll take care of this. (eerie music) You're not going to get Joe or his kid, you bitch. Bitch. Damn it. I know you're around here some damn where. (eerie music) (Van screams) Joe! (suspenseful music) [Man] Too early to rise. Can't come out. [Man] Too early, it's too soon! Joe! (suspenseful music) (vampires snarling) (glass clattering) (suspenseful music) (gun firing) Joe! Joe!. [Man] Getting dark soon. Getting stronger. Pull. On your right, Joe, on your right! (dramatic music) (vampires screaming) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) Judge, Judge! [Axel] You're early, Sarah. Close the lid before I burn. Rains is dead. Deputy, too. They're going house to house now, killing as they go, killing off all of your followers. [Axel] Then I'll have to make some more followers, won't I? It's time we got rid of the old and brought in some fresh blood. Now let me rest. Jeremy. I told that kid not to leave. Jeremy! Now don't hide on me. I told him to stay here. Sons of bitches. They got him. You better sit down, you're losing a lot of blood. I've got more blood than I need. Your boy told us his coffin is in the schoolhouse basement. And they want us to come there. It's getting dark, and that's where they'll be. We'll stop on our way and get gas. That's where they want us. This should keep them busy for a while while while we go to the school. (building booming) (dramatic music) Let's go, let's go! (dramatic music) Joe, that window, no bars. (gentle music) (eerie music) I couldn't let you leave Salem's Lot without seeing this production that our young people have prepared. Children. (eerie music) Don't be alarmed, and don't be frightened. They won't attack you unless I say so. So I finally meet the head man himself. Are you in a lot of pain, Doctor? It keeps me alert. At my age, I have a tendency you know to doze. I'm four times your age, and still going strong. I must be doing something right. I presume you were dead once, so you'll know. What's over there? An indescribable sweetness. God? He forgives us. Who is he, God? Different from us as we are different from you. Let me take away your pain, Doctor, and give you eternal life. I've lived my life. All right, gentlemen, it's showtime! (dramatic music) [Joe] Jeremy, listen to me. Dad, dad! Get up, get up now! Jeremy, they have no power over you. You're free, and they're dead! Please, no dad. [Joe] And you are not dead! You are not dead! Jeremy! Jeremy please! Now for the traditional scene that you gentlemen tried to perform on some of the town folk. The stake in the heart. Stand up! I've seen my kinsmen die this way and I've seen their bodies consigned to hell fire. [Jeremy] No, don't. [Joe] No! No! (gun fires) (stake clatters) (gun fires) (dramatic music) (Axel yells) You'll never make a bloodsucker out of me, you bastard. (gun fires) The human took his own life. Do you see that smoke? Do you know what's going on? The coffins are burning. Your very homes are burning. There's no place to hide. When the sun comes up, you'll fry. You'll fry, the sun will burn you right to your souls. Every last fucking one of you, you're going to fry. Dad, help me! (people whacking) (people crying out) Jeremy, get up! Get up and run! (whacks) (cries out) I'm not dead! Stop, let them be. Get to the cellar. Save the coffins. Let Cathy have them. (people screaming) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (Cathy screaming) Our baby! (Cathy screaming) Our baby, out baby! (Cathy screaming) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) Get out of here. No. (dramatic music) [Woman] Save the coffins, our coffins! Our coffins are burning! Put out the fire! (dramatic music) (vampires screaming) (dramatic music) (people coughing) (dramatic music) (Amanda screaming) (dramatic music) You, you've murdered all of us! Isn't that why you brought me back here? To bring your peace at last? No. No! Clara, pray. (whacks) (vampire cries out) (dramatic music) (fire crackling) I think we'll be safe here. We'll stay here until the sun comes up. They'll either be dead or back in their coffins. Amanda, too? Yes, Amanda, too. (dramatic music) You've angered me, Joseph, you made me lose control, made me show my true face. (dramatic music) Now it's time I took your souls. (dramatic music) You're mine now. (dramatic music) (Axel screaming) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (fire crackling) (building booms) (dramatic music) (car honking) (dramatic music) Who the hell is in that bus? Get on. You've got more fucking lives than a vampire. Suicide's for nazi sons of bitches. Should have been a play actor Mr. Van Meer. What the hell, turn your back, shoot a gun, fall down, that's all there is to it. I'd have been here before, but damn ankle. I don't know how in the hell I got this tank moving. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (vampires screaming) (engine rumbling) (vampires screaming) (fire crackling) We'll find the state police and tell them. Who'll believe vampires? In 500 years, who'll believe there were Nazis? [Joe] We couldn't have gotten them all. I think they'll all choose to die together, than wait for us to come back with help. I think we'll find nothing there. All of the sudden I'm not in such a rush to grow up. Me neither. And I guess getting old isn't so bad either. Joe, I think he's becoming a human being. Don't let his mother find out. (dramatic music) (horn honks) (dramatic music)
