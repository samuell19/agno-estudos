Captioning sponsored by CBS ...well, that being said, you better clear next week, too, then. And ask Raymond in the design department to e-mail me the blueprints of the factory. Okay? Can I just have the keys? When I know I'm on the flight. No, no, no. No, no, I'm gonna make it. No, I'm just talking to my kid. I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it. Dad, this is bull. Doug! Just... Have him forward me the steel specs then. Okay? Hi. Can you tell me what time Flight 52 arrives? 11:15 a.m., Tokyo time. Any bags to check? No. Just carry-on. Okay? They're already boarding. You'll have to hurry. Okay. MAN: I hope they'll be all right. GIRL: Come on, Dad. You can worry just as easily on the plane as in here. Let's go. I don't care whose birthday it is or how hard it was to get the tickets. The SATs are next week, and you're locked inside until then. But it's okay for me to be your driver? Don't be a smart ass. You wanted the car, so you're dropping me off. Yeah. Whatever. It's not "whatever." We had a deal, and you have to live up to your end of the bargain. It's not a deal. You want me to go to college, and that's that. Yeah. I want you to have options. All right. I've got to go. All right. I'll call you when I land, see if you need any help. Yeah, you mean you'll check up on me. ( chuckles ) Come on. Get on the plane. If that's the way you want to look at it. Hey! ( keys jangling ) Forgetting something? ANNOUNCER ( over P.A. ): This is the final boarding call for Pacific Global's Flight 52 to Tokyo. Passengers must proceed immediately to Gate 24. Electronics checklist? Checked and complete. Hydraulic panel? Set. Weather radar? Operational. Storm front's brewing 1,500 miles out. Okay. ( monitor beeps ) ( pilot chuckles ) David, call Sharon. Let's get this show on the road here. You bet. Hey, Sharon. We all set back there? Just one more straggler coming through the gate, and then we're good to go. ( scoffs ) I know. It's always in my section. ( giggles ) Excuse me, sir. May I see your boarding pass? Yes. You're right up these stairs. Okay. Thank you. Okay. PILOT: Good morning, folks. This is Captain Williams speaking. Welcome aboard Pacific Global Airlines' nonstop service to Tokyo. We'll be getting underway in just a couple of minutes. So take your seats, relax, and we'll have you there before you know it. Made it. Can I take your jacket? Oh, yes. Thank you. Keep you looking fresh for when we land. A little late for that. Well, do you need a drink? Yes. But I better have a coffee, 'cause, uh, I've got work to do. Okay. Maybe later. DAVID: Okay, Dex? Daddy has to go now, buddy. Yeah. That's right. Time to fly the plane. Okay. I love you, too, pal. Bye-bye. Sorry. It's, uh, my son. Well, that's okay... Daddy. ( knock on door ) Hey, guys. Hey. Everything okay back there? Yep. Anything else I should know? Yeah. We're carrying a couple of golden retrievers, uh, down below. And a Mr. Stein in 7B has permission to look in on them mid-flight. No problem. Are you done with this, Dave? Yeah. Thanks, Sharon. Okay, guys. Let's get going here. Ground control, Pacific Global 52 ready for pushback from gate six. Roger, Pacific Global 52. You are clear for takeoff. Yeah, well, he didn't just leave you, Mom. He left me, too. Excuse me. We're about ready to take off. You're gonna have to shut that off, now. Okay. Mom, I've got to go. The phone cop says I have to hang up now. What's the difference? It's all the same. Exactly. So you and Mom won't mind switching. Please? All right. Sorry, but you're gonna have to take your seats now. Okay. PILOT: Folks, please turn off your cellular phones and electronic devices. They are no longer permitted at this time. Appreciate it. Okay. That's going off now. I was looking at the proofs of the menu. You know, if there's a problem with the layout, we're not going to have time to... Can you relax for one second, please? It's all under control. All right? No. No, it's not. Okay? We open in three weeks. And there's always, you know, the "if" factor. If we lose our ma?tre d', if the coolers don't arrive... If you don't shut up. Where'd the flight attendant go? I just want to confirm we have the conference room. PILOT: Flight crew, please take your seats and prepare for takeoff. Are you sure you're from the same gene pool? He was swimming in the shallow end. What? Huh? PILOT: Tower, this is Pacific Global 52 ready for takeoff. Roger, Pacific Global 52. You are clear for takeoff. Gear up. Roger. Gear coming up. Flaps up. Flaps up. Engage yaw damper. Yaw damper engaged. Oakland Center, this is San Francisco tower handing off Pacific Global flight 52. Flight 52, you are leaving TRACON airspace. Entering Oakland Center airspace. Please make contact with Oakland Center at 132.05. Have yourselves a good flight. Oakland Center, this is Pacific Global 52 climbing to a flight level of 65,000 feet. Estimated cruising speed nine-three-zero knots. Roger, 52. Radar contact. You are cleared to flight level six-five-zero via flight-planned route to Tokyo. You've kept a tight lid on this? The men in this room and the pilots in the air. That's it, Admiral. Commander... the pilots are standing by. Awaiting the commencement of the missile test. Very well. Is this the projected range of the missile? 500 miles, sir. If the Phoenix missile is successful, it will double the range of any air-to-air missile in production. That's an awfully wide berth. Yes sir, but we're gonna need it. When the target drone drops from the C-130, it'll climb to an elevation of 65,000 feet and establish a circular pattern. The F-18 will be moving at Mach One when it targets the drone. The missile will be moving and accelerating at better than one mile per second by the time it hits the target drone. There's a lot of elements at play, sir. Now, with a lack of a warhead, will it affect the missile's accuracy? No, sir. We've replaced the warhead with a titanium replication. Targeting will remain exact. Commander, the C-130 is reporting rough weather moving in. We've had a storm hovering out there all day. Should we consider postponing? It's just another variable for the missile, Admiral. Storm's been upgraded to tropical. We're gonna be up above the weather, but it's gonna kick up a head wind that's gonna slow us down. Change course? Well, you want to sit over here one of these days. What would you do? 90 minutes out of SFO and ahead of schedule-- it won't affect our arrival time. That's it? And, uh, it would save on fuel and make for a much smoother ride for the passengers. I'd do it. Well, geez. Maybe I can retire. Leave this flying computer to you two. Hang out with the grandkids. Play a little golf. Yeah, well, let's just hope you don't play golf with the grandkids, 'cause the world can't afford to have that slice of yours passed on. Very funny. Very amusing. I'm serious. This is a funny guy here. Huh? Oakland, Pacific Global 52 requests permission to deviate for weather. Roger, Pacific Global 52. Deviate as needed. That'll take us close to intersection Hawws. Yeah, that's a military operations zone. Want me to plot an alternate course? Naw, they'll stay on their side of the line, and we'll stay on ours. Okay, commencing turn. More coffee? Oh, yes, please. Thank you. Good timing. Well, that looks like fun. What? Oh... ( laughs ) Yeah. Just trying to keep up. ( wry laugh ) I know the feeling. ( sighs ) CAPTAIN ( over P.A. ): We've reached our cruising altitude of 65,000 feet, and a speed just below the sound barrier. At this time, you're free to move about the cabin. We hope you relax and enjoy the ride. We were thinking about changing the name of the restaurant. Oh, yeah? So was I. So how about "Mickey's Mind"? Our menu changes by the minute? Hmm. Very funny. Change the menu?! So we're not actually...? You know what? Never mind. Elements in position, Commander. Contact the C-130. Launch target. Navy 559, this is Home Plate. Roger, Home Plate. This is Navy 559 in position. Launch target. Home Plate, target drone has been launched. ( over phone ): It's Doug. Leave a message at the beep. ( beep ) Listen, I'm sorry I snapped at you. When I get home, we'll sit down, we'll talk man-to-man about the whole college thing, okay? All right? All right, I love you. Where are you? Study. Bye. Okay, the oysters will be harvested in Massachusetts at 6:00 a.m., and then touch down in Tokyo in time for dinner. Beautiful. That's if they make their connection and if we can maintain a supply, and if nothing slows us down. Rachel, some cocktails? Yeah. Tell them to leave he cart. What? What? What did I say? Amazing. Whew! The drone is transmitting and is accelerating to Mach 2. Contact Navy 347 and confirm. Navy 347, this is Home Plate. Do you have target acquisition? Affirmative, Home Plate. 347 has preliminary target acquisition. Mr. Stein? Excuse me. Are you the head stewardess? Flight attendant, Dad. I've been called worse. ( laughs ) I've been instructed to take you below. That sounds ominous. ( both laughing ) Maybe you should take a couple of those; chill out. I'm chilled. Just enough. CARLA: Mmm. ( chuckles ) At least Carter and Kennedy will be happy to see me. Ooh, we should get moving. It says here every two hours and it's been almost three. They're fine. They've got each other to keep them company. You're right. They're fine. I know they're fine. Oh, this way. Oh, sorry. He'll be fine, once we land. I'll take care of him. Oh... Is there another restroom? There's one in the back of this section. Right in here. Thanks. Carl, hand me my binoculars. What is that? Probably some military jock doing some high altitude maneuvers or something. We did deviate pretty far south. CARL: We're close to the military zone, but we're still outside its perimeter. I lost visual. What do you think? Well, it's pretty far off our starboard. Carl, make your way back to the galley window. See if you can spot it. Go easy back there. We don't want to alarm anybody. If it comes any closer, we'll turn. I'm gonna get the folks back in their seats. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain speaking. We may encounter a little turbulence, uh, so I'm gonna put the seat belt sign back on and ask that you return to your seats and buckle up. Thanks. Why would anybody wear that? And you know who she's dating. Ugh! I know. Excuse me. Navy 347, confirm good target resolution. Home Plate, Navy 347 has target in good resolution. Distance is 480 miles. Over. Foxtrot-Alpha-Whiskey-- fire at will. Navy 347, this is Home Plate. Foxtrot-Alpha-Whiskey-- fire at will. Repeat: Navy 347, Foxtrot-Alpha-Whiskey. Roger, Home Plate. Fire one. There they are. ( laughing ) Watch your head. Thanks. Hello, guys. Hello there, huh? Did you miss me? Hey, did you miss me? Do you travel with them often? Nope. This is the first time. It was all part of a deal I made with the girls: if I took the transfer, then the entire family would move to Tokyo for the year. Right, guys? Huh? Huh? Where we goin'? ( intercom rings ) Where we goin', huh? Sharon here. CARL: Hey. We're getting people back to their seats now. We'll be right up. Home Plate, this is Navy 347. Confirm that only one target drone was dropped. Navy 347, this is Home Plate. Confirm: only one target drone dropped. Home Plate, I read two targets. Turbulence shouldn't last long. Then we'll open up the room again. Okay, just, uh, just need one more minute. Is it a fighter? No. No, that's a military target drone. ( passengers screaming ) Holy...! We're losing pressure! ( grunting with effort ) My God! CARL: Captain! Captain! Captain! ( screaming ) Help! Mom! Help! Mom! ( screaming ) (screaming) ( screaming ) ( screaming ) ( screaming ) ( screaming ) ( screaming ) This is Pacific Global 52. Come in! Oakland Center, come in, please! I'm going to release the autopilot. Try to take this thing down manually. Deploy the spoilers. Spoilers deployed. All right. (screaming) Reprogram the autopilot to pull us out at 11,000 feet. (screams) ( screams ) (air hissing) Current altitude? Flight level 570. Descending at 12,000 feet per minute. Make sure the air packs are on full everywhere. Air packs on. (air hissing) ( screaming ) Autopilot ready to level out at 11,000 feet. In three minutes. Drop us faster! We'll be out of oxygen by then. I can't. If I drop, the flaps will shear off. Keep your finger on the autopilot. Lock it in before you pass out. Captain! Captain! (air hissing) ( inhaling deeply ) (banging on door) Sir, something is strange here. The drone target signal is still active, but the Phoenix is no longer transmitting. Navy 347, this is Home Plate. We are receiving conflicting signals. Our monitors verify missile impact. However, target drone is still transmitting. Do you copy? MAN: Confirm missile impact. Tracking target drone in vertical fall since impact. It is descending at a rate of... 12,000 feet per minute. The missile may have just grazed the drone. Without a warhead, it would take a full-face hit to destroy it. 12,000 feet per minute is too slow. Well, the impact may have distorted the drone's shape, increasing the drag, slowing its descent. Home Plate, this is Navy 347. Vertical scan indicates the target's descent rate has decreased. 12,000 feet per minute. 8,000 feet per minute. 6,000. Target leveling out at 11,000 feet. 347, proceed toward target immediately. Roger, Home Plate. I'm 460 miles out. ETA is 16 minutes. There is only one explanation for a recovery from a rapid descent like that. I'm aware of that, Admiral. ( inhaling deeply ) We got air. We got air! We got air. We're stuck. (crying) Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Home Plate, Navy 347 has visual contact. We hit a commercial airliner. Confirm last transmission. Confirm contact with a commercial transport. There's a three-foot hole on its starboard side. and a six-foot one in the port fuselage. Are we operating outside our hot zone? I don-/////!t know, sir. It-/////!s close. Is it possible the missile locked on to something outside the zone? It-/////!s possible, sir, if they were close enough to the perimeter, and had a big enough heat signature. What would be flying that high? 347, can you identify aircraft? Home Plate, it-/////!s a Pacific Global Straton. It-/////!s a new SST. They-/////!re running out of San Francisco. Why weren't we told about this? We were, sir. They must be flying outside their normal corridor. 347, are there any signs of life onboard? No apparent movement in the cabin or the cockpit. I'm less than 30 feet away. 347, drop back to a safe distance and monitor from there. That aircraft is unstable. Copy. Roger, Home Plate. Go. Hello! Hello! Hey! Hey! Oh, my God. Oh, no. Oh, God. Hello! Oh, my God. Hello! Help! ( banging on door ) Help! Help! Hello! I can hear you! Help! ( banging on door ) ( banging on door ) Hello! Help! I'm coming! I can't open the door! Make sure it's unlocked! It is! Hang on. What? No! Don't go away, please. Please don't go away! Please! Wait a second. I won't leave you. Please! Okay! Hang on. Hang on. Okay. Okay. Can you push it out? Yes. Are you okay? Uh-huh. Good. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Are they all dead? No. Yes, they are. You're lying. They're not moving. Listen to me. They're unconscious. Okay? From the decompression. All right? They're all unconscious. Now, let me try and get us some help. I'm going to need to find a crew member. Wait. Wait. I think I saw a crew member go in a elevator. Where? There. There. Okay. Okay. Come with me. Okay. Get low. Get low, okay? Go! Hello? We're here! The power's out. You'll have too open it manually. Okay. Are you okay? Yes. ( grunting ) You okay, sir? Yeah. I'm okay. Are you okay? Yeah. Okay. What happened? I don't know exactly. I felt something slam into the plane, and... and then we went into a free fall. There are holes in the side of the plane. Oh, my God! Sir! No! Don't! Wait! Stop! Wait! Be careful! ( crying ) I have to get to the cockpit. Wait. The captain's dead. We're on autopilot. We have to radio for help. Sir! Are you okay? Strap yourself in. ( pounding ) Hello! ( pounding ) Hello! ( indistinct conversations ) There's been no Mayday on either international emergency channel. Maybe their radio's down. Anyone who survived the impact would have been subjected to complete decompression, sir. There's less than one percent oxygen in subspace and no one is surviving on that. How do you account for the plane's leveling off? Maybe in the chaos someone had the sense to re-engage the auto-pilot. Matos reported them slumped over the consoles, sir. So you're assuming everyone is dead? It's an unfortunate probability, sir, but yes. I believe they're all dead. David! David! David! Can you hear me, David? What's our flight number? Fifty-two. Okay, David. Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. This is Pacific Global Flight 52. Do you copy? Are you a pilot? Twin engines. Nothing like this. Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. This is Pacific Global Flight 52. Do you copy? ( beeping ) Carson? Yeah, Jack. You got 52 to Tokyo? Uh, hang on. Yep. They're overdue with their position report. Yeah, you're right. No update since Haaws. You want me to send a request? Give 'em until 14:30. JOHN: Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. This is Pacific Global Flight 52. Do you read me? ( static hissing ) Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. This is Pacific Global Flight 52. Do you read me? ( static hissing ) Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. This is Pacific Global Flight 52. Does anyone copy? Sharon! Sharon, I need your help in here. What about me? You stay with the copilot. If he wakes up and starts talking at all, come and get one of us. Mayday, Mayday, Mayday... I-I can't do that. I'm not...I'm not even supposed to be here. I mean, my dad was supposed to visit me and then my mom said that I had to go and Japan to see him, and... I... It's all just this big mistake. You're right. You're right. But we can't change that. Right now we have to look after each other. Okay, you can do this. What if he dies? He won't die. You just stay with him. Keep him company. His name is David. I'll be back to check on you in a bit. You'll be fine. Anything yet? Does anyone copy? Nothing. If we were transmitting, someone would have responded by now. Do you know this cockpit? Anything look familiar in here? You're the pilot. My Skymaster is all dials and gauges. This is a glass cockpit. All the instrumentation is here. I just don't know where. Now, we need to make contact with someone who does. That's our first priority. Okay. Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. This is Pacific Global Flight 52. Anyone copy? There's been nothing broadcast on any frequency. Keep on it. Yes, sir. Nothing, sir. It won't be long before Oakland Center realizes that they've lost contact with the Straton. We have containment for now. I'm proposing we classify the aircraft as a derelict ship and act upon it accordingly. Scuttling an abandoned trawler is a long way from downing a commercial airliner. Perhaps, sir, but these are the facts as we know them right now. There is no physiological way that anybody would have survived explosive decompression. That aircraft is on autopilot and it will, if left unabated, eventually fly back over land, run out of fuel and then drop to the ground. We've already made one mistake today. I would caution against acting too hastily. I believe not acting would be our second mistake, sir. If the hull of that aircraft were ever found, the facts would make themselves known. Ballantine. Get me the oceanic depth charts for the area. Yes, sir. Won't it work? No power. Oh... ( beep ) Mine works. We're 1500 miles from the closest cell tower. We've got to be just off the coast to get any reception. What about the radio? It's not transmitting. We probably lost connection with the antenna. So... we're alone up here? For now. ( pounding ) Hello! Help! We're in here! Help! Is anybody out there? ( breathing heavily ) ( pounding ) Hello! There's nobody out there. No. Hey. Sis, listen to me. If there was anybody out there, they would have heard us by now. I'm the pessimist in the family, right? And I know we are going to be okay. Hey. Listen. Listen. You hear? We're still flying. Okay. That's because they're all dead, Mickey. And so are we. ( distant sirens wailing ) Pacific Global, this is Oakland Center. Flight 52's position report is overdue. Are you in contact with them? We'll look into it. Jack. Oakland Center lost contact with 52. Try the data link. Find out what's going on up there. ( beeping ) Hey, Sharon? Do you have any idea what that is? It's the data link! Why didn't I think of that? The what? "Flight 52, what is your status?" It's-It's Pacific Global. In San Francisco? No, no, there's a terminal in the dispatch office. We can text message back and forth. Woo! Are you kidding me? Tell them what's going on. Tell them what's going on. Emergency. Mayday. Aircraft damaged. Radio dead. Mid-Pacific. Need help. "Flight 52... Woo! "...Mayday call received. Standby on this channel." ( printing ) "Flight 52, explain nature of emergency. "Nature of assistance. Amount of fuel. Present position." Okay, tell them pilot dead. Copilot unconscious. Navigator lost. Tell them I am, uh, a weekend pilot. "Two holes in cabin. "Suspect bomb. "Complete decompression. "Three passengers, one flight attendant survived. Others dead or comatose. Need help." That's an understatement. Got Mr. Johnson on the phone for you. Mr. Johnson. Yeah, we got a plane in distress. Flight 52 to Tokyo. It's a Straton. How bad is it? Explosive decompression. Flight crew dead. We've made contact with a flight attendant and a weekend pilot. They and two others were in positive pressure areas during decompression. Was it a bomb? Could well be. We're gathering as much information as we can. Can this, uh, pilot handle a Straton? I don't know. I'm gonna try taking him through a turn. Well, if you think he can handle it, then do it. I'll be there in 20 minutes. Okay, people, listen up. I need detailed charts of Flight 52's last known position, fuel estimates and contingency plans. On the double. ( forcefully claps ) Let's go. Nichols, what is there current position. They're about to fly over the Nelson Abyssal. It's over two miles deep. It's been 55 minutes since the Phoenix struck the Straton. There's been no change in course or speed. Our course of action seems very clear. If she remains aloft, we risk further loss of life. Not to mention the damage that this incident could inflict upon the Navy and upon our country. Washington authorized this test because we don't want to fight even. We want to fight ahead. And as unfortunate as this situation may be, if it surfaces, it could cost us that advantage, sir. I may not agree with your assessment of the situation, but this is your command. Given what we know, I won't stand in your way. Understood, sir. Get me Navy 347. Navy 347, standby. Home Plate, this is Navy 347, standing by. Navy 347, this is Home Plate. You are to render the autopilot on the Straton inoperable. Confirm. Confirm, Navy 347. Roger, Home Plate. Navy 347 proceeding with mission profile. Commencing approach. Jack! Based on their current location and fuel report, if you're gonna turn them back you have to do it right now. Let's see what our weekend pilot can do. "Can you identify and use auto-pilot heading knob?" Tell them yes. "Can you recover if you lose control or autopilot fails?" I doubt it. But tell them to give me the coordinates and... let's try this. Request new coordinates. Ready to attempt turn. ( beeping ) Magnetic heading? 80 degrees. Okay. Ready? Uh-huh. Hold on. ( beeping ) Home Plate, I have missile lock. ( beeping ) Home Plate, the Straton is turning. Repeat, the Straton is turning. Heading north. Still turning... Airspeed and altitude unchanged. New course is 80 degrees. ( laughter ) Oh... You did it! Okay. We're headed home. Okay. All right. We've still got to land this beast. "Very nice work. "Everyone here is working hard to bring you home. Standby." Oh, my God. HEMMINGS: He's heading back to California. 347, break off and stay in trail formation. Home Plate, do you require visual of the cockpit? Negative, 347. Stay in trail. Aircraft is still considered unstable. Roger, I read. Stay in trail. Nothing has changed. No. Everything has changed. He made the turn? Without a hitch. All right, be ready to brief me in five minutes. ( dialing phone ) Metz here. It's Wayne Johnson. We have a situation. It's a Straton. Let's find some water. No, Sharon, I need you to stay with me. Could you get it by yourself? Oh, yeah. SHARON: It's in the galley on the left side. Oh, okay. Tough kid. Yeah. They're all tougher than you think. You have any? Me? Oh, no. I haven't found the right guy. Or the time. ( chuckles ) Oh, there's never enough time for them. You just try to do the best you can and not screw them up in the process. Are you close with your boy? Yeah... yeah. Yeah. His mother died when he was four so it's just been us. Then one day, uh, you know, you wake up and... ( laughing ) They've got minds of their own, yeah. Yeah, you got that right. I just, uh, I've got to learn to back off a little. I'm sure you do just fine. Aw, come on. Talk to us, talk to us. ( wind blowing ) You should come upstairs. It's a lot safer. Amy and Erica... wanted to be closer to the movie screen. My wife and I changed seats with them. All the planning for the future... worrying when... the girls would come home late... My whole life was right here. Look, um, we're on our way back to San Francisco... and there are people on the ground that are helping us. W-we're gonna make it. So you should... you should come upstairs. How many planes do we have in the air? Eighteen. Let's make sure they're all right. Listen, folks, if you're not directly involved in getting 52 back, please return to your desks. We need to keep this quiet until we have a clear plan of action. All right? Thank you. Oakland Center's on line six. I'll take that. This is Wayne Johnson. Mr. Johnson, this is Marlene Cobb, Oakland Center. What is the status of Pacific Global 52? We're in contact. There's a radio problem and communication is currently limited to the datalink. They're headed back. I'll call back with specifics once we have them. All right, sir. We'll continue monitoring and await your call. Thank you, sir. Would you give us a minute, please? We've got about an hour until the world starts breathing down our necks. I want these men thinking about that aircraft, not fielding calls from the press or being badgered by some outside agency. So, what's next? Can this guy bring it home? Well, he's a weekend pilot, but with some luck he's got a chance. He says he's got passengers alive but in some sort of coma. Is that even possible? It's not only possible, it's unavoidable. Oxygen deprivation at 65,000 feet. They had no chance. Who are you? This is Anne Metz from Beneficial Insurance. Would you excuse us, please? Sure. This is what we're dealing with. We're staying here. Home Plate, this is Navy 347. Navy 347, go for Home Plate. Home Plate, we have passengers and debris falling from the plane. 347, keep your distance. Roger, Home Plate. Falling back. I'm not leaving my wife. JOHNSON: Instructions on landing: I have to talk him down over a damn typewriter. How is it that this works and not the radio? Datalink runs off a satellite, not an exposed radio antennae. So no one else can monitor your communications? No. No, it dead ends on both sides. So many will die. We have a chance here. It will get worse, not better. And it'll be left on your doorstep. Passenger manifest. Should we have P.R. contact relatives of the passengers? We can start booking them on flights to San Francisco. No, not just yet. I still owe Oakland Center a call and, uh, I want to make sure we're not missing anything before we go public. All right. What's on your mind? There is a finite amount of water in the well. What? Follow me on this. You have an amateur pilot flying the most sophisticated aircraft in the world. There are three scenarios here: One, your weekend pilot crashes into the ocean and everyone on board is killed. 102 death payouts is a figure I can calculate. I'm sure you can. I deal in actuarial tables and loss of life does, in fact, have a fixed price attached to it. Go on. Scenario number two, Mr. Berry slams that plane directly into the heart of downtown San Francisco. Thousands will be killed. And that doesn't concern you much? If he destroys ten city blocks, Federal disaster relief will probably kick in. And you'd be off the hook. Possibly. And outcome number three, if he successfully lands that plane we are all in an unenviable position. Death payout is one thing, but that man is carrying a plane full of patients likely requiring around-the-clock care for the rest of their diminished existence. Billions of dollars in lawsuits, victims' families, pain and suffering. The bills will be endless. Beneficial Insurance will be bankrupted anth theicms will go after your airline. You guys always figure out a way to pay. Not this time. The numbers are too big. Pacific Global will fold under the weight of the Straton. There is no upside to landing that plane. There are people alive up there. Marginally. I still think he has a chance. JOHN: Our fuel's low. Well how could that be possible? We're supposed to be going all the way to Tokyo. The fuel load would have been calculated for the thin air at 60,000 feet. Down here we're probably burning at three times that rate. I don't know if we have enough fuel to make it all the way back. What's going to happen to them? Are they going to... are they going to stay like that? I don't know, but they're going to need help as soon as possible. METZ: You could include others in the decision process, but that would take time. You think the board will vote on something like this? How many thousand of families will be ruined when Pacific Global folds? I mean think of all the people on the ground whose lives will be destroyed by some insane gamble to try to land that plane. I mean you can't even talk to the guy. He's over the Pacific heading towards a storm. And very soon the decision will be out of your hands. It's Oakland Center on six. They want an update. This is Wayne Johnson. We've lost contact with Flight 52. Initiating search and rescue. What? When did that happen? Pacific Global is reporting the loss of Flight 52. Search and rescue are en route. We've lost containment. No, no, no, no, no, no. The window is just tightening. All right, if they find this aircraft, that's just going to be the beginning of a very lengthy and damaging investigation that the Navy does not need. The Nimitz is the closest carrier. They're launching search and rescue now. 75 minutes is the earliest intercept. We are ending this right now. Home Plate, this is Navy 347, confirm current mission. Navy 347, this is Home Plate. Confirm current mission. This aircraft is deemed derelict. Confirmed. Home Plate, this is 347. Requesting permission to abort current mission. Negative, 347. Proceed as ordered. Confirm, proceed as ordered. Negative, Home Plate. Navy 347 cannot follow that order at this time. 347, you are in violation of a direct order. Consider the consequences. Navy 347 has, sir. 347, that is a derelict ship! Do you understand? No, sir. It's a ship in distress. He knows he can't be court-martialed for refusing an order you have no authority giving. That boy isn't killing anybody else today and neither are we. 347, this is Admiral Hennings. Report to the Nimitz. Current mission is aborted. Repeat, current mission is aborted. Roger, Home Plate. Navy 347 en route to Nimitz. Good luck. Admiral, this is my command. I will put more aircraft in the air. No, you won't. You're going to wait until Matos lands on the Nimitz to see if he keeps his mouth shut. There's no guarantee that the Straton will even make it back to San Francisco. Our problems could just disappear into the ocean. Maybe. That's no longer your decision. Now you can tell whatever story suits you best. But my report to the Pentagon will be as it happened. ( foghorn blowing ) JOHNSON: I need two copies of the datalink printouts. One to be forwarded to air traffic control. The other for corporate. I'm assembling all the available senior West Coast executives. Well, I can monitor the datalink while you brief corporate. No, no listen, I need you to make those copies while I try to make contact. If there's anyone left to make contact with. I-I just don't understand. There's no way the satellite failed or we'd be hearing about it from our other aircraft. And if the datalink was working before, then it should be working... Yeah, it should be, but it's not. Which is why I initiated search and rescue. Or would you feel better if we kept pinging away in there and let whatever survivors drown while we tried to work out the bug in our system? Right. Right. ATC is waiting for those printouts. Keeping everyone busy? Keeping their minds on their work. And outside this room, while you create a paper trail. JOHNSON: "Working on a solution." Now that was our last successful communication with 52. Then I scrambled search and rescue. It's all by the book. I'm assuming you have a plan? Yeah. What not to do in the cockpit of the world's most advanced plane. SHARON: Have you ever flown through anything like this? In my little Skymaster? Ha! We'd be turning around and looking for the nearest airport to set down in. No airports to turn back to here. Nope. We can't fly over it and it could be hundreds of miles long. Well what about if you left it on autopilot? If the turbulence is too great. it could disengage the autopilot. Then I'd have to take the controls. ( thunder rumbling ) I'll take that chance. Yeah. All right. Let's, uh, let's see if they have any advice. Are you ready? I don't think anyone is ever ready for something like this. "Heavy turbulence expected as you pass "through the storm. "It's very important " that you alter the center of gravity "by transferring fuel between tanks." By... what? Does that sound wrong? Well, if I knew where the tanks were. Yeah, still no luck. You look like you could use a break. Thanks. But I need you out there making sure our other planes are in the air. What's with the manual? There's going to be a press conference later and I just want to be on top of all the details. Listen, speaking of which-- I need a report on everything that happened today. A roster of everyone on duty, step-by-step action taken by your staff as well as your own thought process behind any and all actions taken. Now? Jack, you were the senior man on duty today. FAA and NTSB will want to know what you did and when you did it. Now I'm already starting to compile my own timeline of events. I suggest you get to yours while it's still fresh in your mind. Timeline. Right. What's going on? How much do you like your job? What do you need me to do? Why can't you just go down on your own. "In the center of the overhead CRT screen "are four touch pads designated 'low-pressure' fuel valve position." JOHN: We got them. Got it, yeah. "Switch them to the off position." Off? That's what it says. All of them? Well let's just try one and see what happens. They want acknowledgment. Yeah, and I want to make sure that I don't screw this up. ( thunder rumbling ) Okay. Is that all? "Is that all?" No, it says, "locate "covered switch reading 'fuel valve emergency power.'" Okay, got it. "Engage the switch." Engage the switch? This doesn't feel right. Will you...? Confirm that. Just turn the damn thing... Shh! ( softly ): Turn the damn thing off. John, they know what they're doing down there. Yeah, I just wish I knew what I was doing up here. That's all. John! ( screaming ) ( alarms blaring ) SHARON: Get the fuel switch back to on! I have. It doesn't seem to make any difference. Autopilot is off. I have to take control. What does the altimeter say? SHARON: 9,632. Make that 28. Keep calling it out every 500 feet. 8,500 feet. How long before they're down? They were dead the minute they switched off the engines. 4,500 feet! We've got to re-ignite the engines, somehow. We're at 4,000 feet! Dropping 50 feet a second. Two minutes. We've got to find the re-ignition switch. Where? Somewhere within my reach. Can you see down here? Wait! I've got it! Hit 'em. Turn them on. Okay, hold on, I got to get the nose up. 1,500 feet! Oh, my God! Hang on! Hang on! We're stalling out! Hit the afterburners. The A.B.'s. ( afterburners roaring ) 500 feet. And climbing. ( laughs ): You're flying. Yeah. Yes, we are. I still can't stabilize this thing. What's our altitude? 11,000 feet. That's where the autopilot was cruising. Let's try it. Okay, come on. ( John sighs ) Back in the comforting hands of technology. Whew! Good flying. Good copiloting. Whew! "Flight 52, do you read? "Acknowledge. San Francisco Headquarters. What's your status?" What's our status? We're still alive. No thanks to you. Shutting down the fuel lines. What am I, an idiot? They don't want us back. Why? I don't know. Maybe they don't think I can land this thing safely. Maybe somebody screwed up, and they're just trying to cover their tracks. JOHN: You know what, I don't really know why, and I don't really care. Alls I know is... we're on our own. Let 'em think we're gone. We don't have a lot of options. We're 45 minutes out from SFO and the autopilot can get us close, but sooner or later we're on our own. I can put her down in the bay and we might make it out, but what about the rest of the passengers? I know the approach pretty well. Not the technical end of it, but if it's clear, I can, uh, probably get you to the airport. You can get us to the airport, visually? Yeah. All right. We better do something about these passengers first. ( phone auto-dials ) Miller here. They've left. Good. Now get me the last coordinates and headings for flight 52. Right. Thanks. We'll be home soon, my love. Ladies, gentlemen... it's been a hell of a day. I'll fill you in on everything that's happened. Now, most of you are familiar with Anne Metz from Beneficial. She's already briefed me on our liability situation. It isn't pretty. The autopilot is gonna get us to the outer marker, and then I'm gonna have to take the controls. If I was a pro I would fly right over San Francisco, out over Oakland and circle back, and then come in and grab one of those... runways by the bay. Oh, God, this is gonna be hard. Pilots say SFO is one of the hardest to land at. I'm gonna be flying over millions of people. I'm going to be fighting the bay's crosswinds. I... I don't think I can do it. Well, what if you tried the straight-in approach? This plane needs a lot of stopping room. The runways at SFO are just barely long enough to accommodate it even with an experienced pilot. If we overshoot, we're gonna go skidding right into the bay. And if you come in the correct way and go long, we run dead into the new Bay Center Complex. All right, all right. You get us to the airport, and then we're gonna drop down towards the bay runway. Agreed? Agreed. Yeah. How will they know we're coming? We're gonna be showing up on their radar any minute now. They'll see us lumbering overhead. ( chuckles ): They'll figure it out. We've located Pacific Global 52. We're gonna head it off early and clear some airspace for you. Roger, Oakland. We'll take it from here. It appears that is your plane. I knew they were alive. This is Air Traffic Control. Flight 52 is coming in. We need you to clear all the runways and scramble emergency crews. What? In case we end up in the water. Oh, good idea. There you go. You know, if we do land this thing, it's gonna be next to impossible to prove someone tried to kill us. Check this out. Now we have a record of every transmission sent and received since preflight. Are you kidding me? Fantastic! Let me see that flashlight for a second. Now, there's been no indication of a bomb. For all we know, it's possible that flight 52 went down as a result of mechanical failure. Or potentially a design flaw. Which would lay this squarely at the feet of the Straton people. ( knocking ) Yeah? Flight 52 is on approach. Flight 52 is on approach. You all know what to do. Okay? Yeah. Here goes. I see what you mean about the winds. No, I don't think that's the problem. Well, what is it? There's a device called the yaw damper. It takes the roll out of the flight. When the autopilot's on, it's working. You must have to manually engage it when it's off. Well, w-was it on before? Maybe when we restarted the engines, it reset the system. Or maybe it shorted out, I-I'm not sure. Well, but what happens if we don't find it? The roll will just get worse and worse, the wings dropping from side to side. I can deal with that up here, but... when we get into the crosswinds for the landing, it's gonna get much worse. So when we land, we can hit the wing first? Let's find the yaw damper instead. I can't find anything marked as a yaw damper here. Maybe it's on one of these panels that never came back up. All right, well, even though they're not lit up, they may be doing something-- it's too risky to mess with it. Strap in. Buckle up. We'll have to just go in without it. Hey, Jack? That's some weird approach. Yeah, but not bad for a weekend flier. He found an outside marker and then flew as 'as the crow flies' line towards us. Well, if that's the way they're coming in, we need to clear 'em some room. Guys, I think ten is our best bet. Knock out the lights on all the other runways. Show 'em the way home. They saw us coming in and got runway ten prepped. Well, then, Sharon, give me the numbers. 3,000 feet. 52's on final approach. There you are. 2,700 feet. Okay. Come on. Straighten out. Not so lost after all, huh? He's coming in too hot. 500 feet. Brace yourselves. Okay. Here we go. ( tires squealing ) ( screaming ) ( yelling ) ( grunting ) Hang on! Hold on! ( engines winding down ) ( beeping ) Everyone all right? Yeah. Yeah. I'm okay. I'll trigger the chutes. ( sirens wailing ) Let's get 'em out of here. How the hell did they make it back? They didn't give up. We got a live one up here. Come on. You've got to get out of here now. ( passengers coughing ) REPORTER ( on TV ): Fire and rescue crews are on scene. They're in the process of transporting the survivors to nearby medical facilities. Are they going to be okay? Some better than others. We'll know more when we get them to the hospital. Are you okay? Yeah. Thank you. All right. John! Hey. You two okay? Yeah. Yes. How are you? I'm okay. Have you seen David? He's going to be okay. REPORTER: Exactly what happened to the Straton is still unclear, but its safe return is nothing short of a miracle. FAA and NTSB investigators... We've got more planes to get home people. ...will undergo a thorough examination by authorities. We're getting word that a press conference... He's an amateur pilot who survived a very traumatic experience. ...will hopefully have more answers for us... He's got no proof. No one will ever believe him. Let me show you something. Is that the data link? A complete record. I bet we're going to ruin somebody's night. ( laughs ) Big time! ( phone rings ) Let me take it. Are you sure? Yes. I'll be with you in a minute. Hello? ( sighs ) Well, are you ready to go make some headlines? I guess. Come on. DOUG: Nice flight. What? Thought you said you'd call when you landed. Are you watching this? It's on every channel, Dad. Oh... You have no idea how glad I am to hear your voice. Captioning sponsored by CBS
