Wait. What is it? It feels like someone’s watching. Who? There. There’s no one there. No, I think someone’s inside. No, we’re alone here. Do we have company? I told you I felt something. That perverted bastard! What are you doing? He should let people know he’s here. Mister. Come out. Were you peeping on us? Are you a pervert? Is that it? What, did it start? -Is it starting? -Far from it. Asshole, I just fell asleep. -When’s it starting? -Watch your foot! It’s been hours! Don’t touch me! It’s crowded in here! You’re taking up all the space in here. Shut it! -Then come here and lie down. -Let’s switch places. Switch, damn it. Come on, man! Stop it! Stay put! What the hell? It’s starting! -Open the back! -I thought it wasn’t for a while. What are they doing? They’re all reporters? Chief Oh! Chief! Is this related to the recent serial killings? Quiet down please! Shut up! At 3:10 a.m. this morning-- We can’t hear you! What? We received reports of-- THE EXCLUSIVE: BEAT THE DEVIL’S TATTOO ...were found brutally stabbed to death. According to a witness, a large man stabbed the couple and quickly fled in a red vehicle. TWO BODIES FOUND IN PARK -The police stated that-- -Look! He stepped all over me. Choi’s a Hulk. He crushed me once. I got a bloody bruise. He was a weakling, but he’s so big now. They regularly have eel at company dinners. Shouldn’t we do that too? We don’t even get barbecued pork. It’s nothing but noodle cups for us. City desk, Heo Moo-hyuk. -Can I leave a tip? -Yes. What’s going on there? The murder case that was on the news-- You’ll take responsibility? -Hello? Hello? -Yes, the murder case. -I think I know him. -Is that so? -Yes. -Your name and address. It’s 143 Gusu, Mapo District. I see. It’s for real. One moment. What’s wrong? The owner of DM Industries was directly involved-- Guess who the owner is. -The owner? -Yeah. Park something. You can’t remember the man you investigated for corruption? DM’s owner is... Buyang Group’s owner’s son-in-law’s uncle. Buyang’s up in arms, threatening to pull all their ads! I didn’t know! Pull the article. I’ll write a retraction. You think a retraction will fix this shit storm? How can I do my job when I gotta account for a sponsor’s relatives? We gotta show that we’re taking action. SABBATICAL REQUEST So stay low for a while. -We’ll bring you back. -Bring me-- I’m getting the ax? Sign it. The suits upstairs made the decision. -Damn. -Moo-hyuk! Where are you going? The sponsor must-- I’ll go see Buyang and make peace. -I’ll fix this... -Boy! You’re way out of your league! -Sorry, sir! -Moo-hyuk! -Let’s talk outside. -What did I do wrong? Who okayed this story, huh? I wasn’t the only one who went after DM. Look at it. Let me go! It wasn’t like that. Leave! Get him out of here! How is it? Doesn’t it look great on the wall? Can we delay the opening? I think it’s for the best. Why? Seeing them on the wall, they don’t look right. They’ll trash me so badly. Not too many artists are confident about their work. They’re all pretending. No. This is not right. How about we get dinner later? I’m buying, okay? I’m buying. That tuna restaurant has a special on tuna head. How about that? I’ve never had that. I heard a big fish head is nice. -But I-- -Wait. Morning sickness six months into your pregnancy? I was so worried that I couldn’t even shit. It’s probably because it’s my first. Why don’t you ask your husband to get you something nice? Don’t suffer alone. I don’t want anything from him. One signature and it’s over. Then why did you get pregnant? Get back together. All men are the same. Who cares? Moo-hyuk? Wake up. What are you doing here? Are you drunk? I told you to give me the code. I couldn’t get inside. I thought I was going to freeze to death. Who’s he? Hello there. I’m an artist. I’m having a solo show at Su-jin’s gallery. Do artists visit the curator’s home nowadays? No, you got it all wrong. I’m not a pervert. It’s dangerous at night. You’re driving a pregnant woman around and even visiting her at home. If something happens to the baby, will you take responsibility? Su-jin-- I mean, Ms. Jung. I’ll see you at my studio. I mean, the gallery. -Good night. -Wait! Wait! Drive home safe! Even dogs are artists nowadays? Honey, wait. -Let go! -Hold up. Please. I had a bad day. Please take me in tonight. How can you ask that! Where were you when I needed you the most? I want nothing from you, so don’t expect anything from me. Just sign the divorce papers! And the baby? We have to raise the child properly! -You can’t do it alone. -I don’t need you! Wait. Honey, please! Hey, it’s been a while. It’s Moo-hyuk. Yeah, CNBS. Didn’t you say you needed an experienced reporter? Oh, you got someone... Any openings in your Political News department? Hey! Not doing much now? Okay, do your thing. I’ll call another time. Moron. I saw your classified ad. It’s a male host bar? Thank you. Where does it go? Down south? Is the listed salary correct? Is there an opening for an experienced reporter? Public access stations or even affiliates. Out in the country maybe. Hurry up! Do you know anybody at other stations? Even in a smaller city? Start a business. Sell some shit! -Reporting doesn’t suit you. Open a shop. -I don’t know shit about that. So why mess with a major sponsor? You’re on the blacklist. Everyone knows about you. Who even dares to mess with sponsors nowadays? You should be begging to kiss their ass. I didn’t become a reporter to kiss anyone’s ass. Then am I doing this to kiss ass? It’s all about survival. I lost. It’s your fault! Buy me a drink. MURDER CASE TIP - MAPO 143 It’s 143 Gusu, Mapo District. CHANGJEON - SECOND ALLEY CHUNG-IL VILLA Who are you?

It’s much too quiet. Metro Police. Good evening. Is Chief Oh in? He’s not in at the moment. Could I get his cell number? I’d like to check on something. What’s this about? He’s in Gwangju. Gwangju? He went to Gwangju? Yes. What is it? Wait. So he’ll make the arrest down there? When will this happen? Did he confirm the suspect’s identity? Which media outlet are you with? Hello? Hello? Who can understand the feeling of stabbing her? The first body was discovered in September 2012 in Guri. SERIAL KILLER REPORT SEGMENT -You’re sure? -The primary detective went to Gwangju. A gag order must be in place. They’re investigating in secret. -Why Gwangju? -It’s the killer’s hometown. Only Heo knows about it, and he has the source. If we go with it, it’ll be an exclusive. Who’s the source, a police officer? No, a civilian. -Civilian? -Close to the suspect. That idiot. He caught a major scoop. -Let’s get to work. -Yes, ma’am. What did the director say? Is the follow-up ready? Good morning. -The source knows the suspect? -Yes. -Bring him in. -Yes, ma’am. Bring the editorial team in and arrange a meeting with Buyang! -Make it the morning lead story. -Morning lead? We may be rushing things. We should prep it right for the evening. If the suspect is caught, this story will be buried. Morning lead, no matter what. Prep breaking news and bereaved family interviews. Open police communication and have a team ready for the arrest. -Yes, ma’am. -Director. Am I reinstated? There’s no time. Just get everything ready. CNBS NEWS Good morning. A handwritten note from the serial killer who has been terrorizing Seoul has been obtained by our reporter. Heo Moo-hyuk has the story. The killer has claimed seven lives in the past 28 months. Meticulous and violent, the killer has left no evidence behind, but we have obtained a note from the killer. He vividly describes his emotions during his vicious killing spree, and his words are immensely shocking. “Who can understand the feeling of stabbing her? A person’s staring face the moment before death. The sound of tearing skin, breaking bones, joints snapping and the cries of pain. The warm blood flowing on my hand. I cannot forget the cry for help in her last breath.” The note is filled with bone-chilling descriptions. Without any other available evidence to identify the suspect, I hope this note helps the investigation in a small way. For CNBS, I’m Heo Moo-hyuk. Thank you for the story. This year’s average temperature is on the rise. Next up, the weather. You have to get off the stage. Please hurry. Where is everyone? CONTROL ROOM What’s this? Yo, Moo-hyuk! We got a ton of calls from all the news outlets! It’s a hell of an exclusive! Answer some calls! CNBS! Heo Moo-hyuk! Those flower arrangements look shabby. -Why are you here? -Did you see today’s paper? KILLER’S HANDWRITTEN NOTE CNBS EXCLUSIVE -Front page story. CNBS exclusive. -Why’d you put that there? So people can read it. It’s a brilliant article. I’m busy. Stop pestering me and just go away. Didn’t you see the news? The Internet is going wild! This breaking news is taking the world by storm! -Go away! -Ms. Ko! Can I take my wife out to lunch? Don’t shake your head. Check this out. There’s an amazing story on the front page. SERIAL KILLER’S HANDWRITTEN NOTE IS RELEASED And you didn’t tell me about it? We should’ve done it together, fuck-nut! You don’t have any manners. Screw that. It’s every man for himself. Anyway, thanks for calling. What? Network? The network City desk? Dang. But you must bring in the source and have a chat with the chief. Okay, I got it. Why don’t we get back together? Did you hear? The network wants me. My salary will jump two, three times. I miss home cooking. Don’t you have a kitchen at your place? Cook it yourself. -It’s got a kitchen. -You’re a grown man. The baby will be here soon. You can’t do everything by yourself. It’s toxic, you being there. I’m better off alone. That’s why I wanted this. -Where are we going? -What should we eat? Son of a bitch! Out of the way! I don’t know who it is. How can I tell from a few pictures? Look at the stab wounds. It wasn’t done with an ordinary knife. Didn’t you use to fence these when you were in Incheon? I gave that life up when I came here three years ago. Come on-- Word of newcomers spreads so fast here! And that killer is no petty criminal. He’s a psycho, and he keeps a journal! If he showed up here, we’d all know! He’s on a completely different level! What journal? Didn’t you see the news? What the heck? You said you’d let me go! What the hell are you doing? You promised! -Back to Seoul! -Yes, sir! Yes? -Is your mom here? -Who are you? I’m a news reporter. Where’s your mom? She went to the bathhouse. Let me ask you something. Were there any cops here? Maybe around 1:00 a.m.? I’m not sure. Okay, thanks. Isn’t that-- Isn’t that the killer? CNBS CHIEF YOO Be cool. Hello? I got a call from Gwangju. It’s really quiet over there. The police don’t know anything about the case. Hello? Hey, buddy. Any further contact from the source? Hey, Heo! The killer’s in Seoul. Why is he here? I’m following him. What do you mean? Where are you? That red car! -He’s driving it. I’m close behind. -You’re following the suspect? Yeah! What’s going on with the cops? -Do they know he’s in Seoul? -I’ll handle that. -Do you have a camera? -Camera? No. Use your cell phone cam. -Okay, I’m hanging up. -What for? I gotta hang up to shoot! Damn it! Holy cow! Damn it! Mister! Get out of the way! Move! Excuse me. It’s not that way. Come this way, please. Good afternoon. -Can we sit anywhere? -Let’s sit here. Who can understand the feeling of stabbing her? A person’s staring face the moment before death. The sound of tearing skin, breaking bones, joints snapping and the cries of pain. And the cry for help-- “Don’t kill me! I still have a lot to accomplish, Colonel Liang Chen!” Hearing that, I want to stab even more! Cut even more! Tear even more! Liang Chen, you bastard! Die! This can’t be. No, this can’t be. I can’t be dying. The pain is over. No more suspicion, no more sorrow. Death cures all evil. I’ll take it all with me. I’m fucked. -Thank you! -Give us good reviews, please! Take care now. Thank you! -Give us good reviews, please! -Thank you! Thank you! -Take care now. -Good-bye. Thank you! Give us good reviews, please! Did you make these yourself at home? DO YOU GUYS KNOW THE KILLING? Yes, I made everything myself. What’s your hometown? Pardon? Your hometown, is it Gwangju? Yes, Gwangju. That is indeed my hometown. How did you know? Are you a fan? Did you love the play? How about an autograph? If you make things like that, you could get arrested! Goddamn it. Mr. Heo, I got the camera. Where are you? No need to come. -What? -Don’t come. Where? Where should I go? There’s no need to come. It’s pointless! I don’t need a camera! THREE BROTHERS THEATER It’s all over! Damn it! You can’t reveal the source? It’s our duty to protect our sources. Seven people have died and you won’t cooperate? If we hand over the source, can you guarantee his safety? The police stood back and allowed seven people to die! How are we supposed to trust you with this? It is mandatory for the media to hand over any vital tips. This is obstruction of justice! Why do you think he came to us instead of calling the police? He chose us over the police. You should be ashamed. Chief, let’s get a warrant and clean out this place. They crossed the line. How about this? We get first notice of any progress made on this case, and we hand over the evidence. Okay? It’s up to you. The killer’s handwritten note. His fingerprints should be on it, maybe some saliva too. DNA. There will be trouble if we give them any advantage. Send it to Forensics. If we’re through, I’ll be off. Wait. How did you hear the killer is from Gwangju? We have a vast information network. Don’t you get it? They get paid for what they do? I’ll fucking kill him! What a fucking day! This way. -Yoo’s sure about it? -Yes. I’ll confirm it myself. He’s getting cocky over one scoop. There! Heo! Director, please sit down. -I’m sorry for making you come here. -No, it’s more discreet this way. Congrats, my boy! The director was right. The ratings are through the roof! We’ll surpass five percent this way. I heard it’s quiet in Gwangju. Did you meet the source? Yes. As for the follow-up story, it may be difficult to proceed. Why? There were some... unforeseen incidents... that happened. I’m sorry. Tell me your terms in detail. What do you mean? I know other outlets are trying to poach you. Are you in talks with newspapers? We never paid your expenses. Please take this. The manager position in Politics opened up. A 40% salary increase, 100% signing bonus. You can cover the national congress or the ruling party. It’s a stepping-stone in your career, and you’ll make connections. This is so sudden-- Once this case is over, your options will narrow. You saw your colleague move up. You were left behind to do grunt work. I’ll compensate you. You know full well how territorial newspaper guys are. You won’t last long there. -What I mean is-- -That’s enough! If you hold out any longer, we’ll look incompetent! -Boss, please! -People are looking! Don’t be like that. We’ll protect you from the police. Don’t worry about anything. Focus on the follow-up. The police? They came up empty-handed. The case could drag on even longer. Wait. I left my phone in the car. Can you lend me yours for a second? -Holy cow! -Here it is. Wait. Is that-- It’s all here. The quality’s great. -Take a look. -You can’t. Don’t you worry! Phone video quality is good. Don’t worry about that. We can broadcast it right away. Ease your mind. If that goes out, I’m deep in shit! This is a CNBS exclusive. This video was shot today by CNBS’s Heo Moo-hyuk. SERIAL KILLER SUSPECT CHASED THROUGH DOWNTOWN The person driving the red car is suspected of being the serial killer. The red car was spotted at the crime scene where a college couple was murdered. You are now watching that very same vehicle. The suspect does not yet know Heo is following him. Our reporter is courageously trailing the suspect, even though he could be caught. This is a real-life situation. The suspect could be beside you right now. Please look around you and call in with tips. -You said Yangpyeong! -It’s Yangsu-ri! The suspect was seen in Yangsu-ri last night at 9:00. He was seen in Gangnam at the same time. We took your statement. Please sit down. Just sit down! Let’s sit and talk! What is all this? The killer’s note is taken from the novel The Killing of Liang Chen. THE KILLING OF LIANG CHEN The police say it’s baseless. Is this a sure thing? Heo made a comeback overnight. He must be onto something. It’s Heo! Don’t push! Hey! What happened? How did you find him? -Who’s the source? -How did you make contact? Later! I’ll tell you later! Where do you meet him? It’s so damn noisy! I don’t care if you’re media! I’ll call the police! Hey, Heo! Moo-hyuk! Heo! Open up! RESIGNATION LETTER It was all based on a false tip. CNBS RELEASES SERIAL KILLER’S HANDWRITTEN NOTE And the cry for help-- “Don’t kill me!” This is my first and last warning. Forget everything about your source. Remember that we are always tested. Wisely passing God’s tests is life’s greatest challenge. Your source failed, so he was punished. He will join the other seven souls. Do not try to find him. I hope that you make the wise choice. Won’t find the source? Join the other seven? Is the source still unreachable? I think it’ll be difficult for me to continue with this story. We should pull the plug and move on to a new story. The repercussions will be nasty. We were finally getting some good ratings. Should we just call the police? -This isn’t our-- -Not a chance! -The police might use us as scapegoat! -Yeah, Heo’s right about that. -If the public turns on us, we’re lost. -We need to be careful what we say. This threat cannot leave this room at all. Forget everything that happened thus far and make a promise with me-- Wait. I understand what you mean. But this is-- This is an extremely special case. The killer killed the source and sent a threat to the reporter. I’ve reported on countless murder cases, but this is by far the most audacious. It’s very... sexy. He’s creative and bold. He’s good, really good. -Let’s go with it. -What? This case will be a masterpiece. He’ll become notorious, and the nation will go wild. It’ll be sensational. A person may have really died. The critics will burn us alive. He’s right. The criticism will be unbearable. This is a hot item. A person’s life is at stake. We must tread carefully. Why did a killer send a letter to the press? Even if we sit on this, there’s no guarantee that he’ll live. Let’s send a reply to the killer. We’ll send a reply. We don’t have an address. But we have a camera. Heo can go on the air. Me? Say that we won’t be threatened and urge him to come forward. Before this leaks, make this the lead on the 3:00 p.m. report. What are you waiting for? Stay alert. This is a newsroom! We are reporters! The spirit of media is alive! Let’s blow this up! Prep and report to me in 30 minutes! -Heo, you’ll go on camera! -I don’t want to. Yoo, clear the studio! -Wait! Please, sir! -Move it! You can’t! No, don’t! No! No! “This is my first and last warning.” SERIAL KILLER SENDS WARNING “I WILL KILL THE SOURCE.” Forget everything about your source. You never had anything. Remember that we are always tested. Wisely passing God’s tests is life’s greatest challenge. Your source failed, so he was punished. -What’s going on? -What is it? He will join the other seven souls. Do not try to find him. I hope that you make the wise choice. Are they all coming here? The killer isn’t here. -Why are they coming? -I know, huh? Mr. Heo, you got a call. She’s called several times. Her name is Clara. -Hello? -Why can’t I reach you? I saw the news. I need to meet you. I’m at the station, in the lobby. It’s really important. Hey, Kim! Ms. Ko? -Su-jin, where’s Kim? -Why? Look at this. Look! We’re in so much shit! This was published a year ago! Kim plagiarized. We are so fucked! You know where he lives. Let’s find him! We gotta catch him before he disappears. I’ll kill him! Let’s go. Goddamn it! Mr. Heo? Come on, hurry! The elevator. Get the elevator. Press all the buttons. -All of them. -Mr. Heo. Get in here! Now! -In the stall! Get inside! -Why? Why are you here? You can’t be here! I’ll explain everything. -I went to your place. -About this? DO YOU GUYS KNOW THE KILLING? I could go to jail. You know whose fault this is? It’s yours! I didn’t know. Anyway, nobody knows. They all fell for it. This is good for you. It worked out. I need money. $30,000. Give it to me. You’re asking me for money? How can you ask that right now? If you don’t, I’ll talk! To whom? You can’t even go to the police. I’ll call other reporters. $30,000. That’s all I need. I want to go home. $30,000. Okay? I want it. I was thinking about you. What brings you? I was in the neighborhood-- You son of a bitch! How could you do this to us? How could you? -What’s wrong? -That’s it? If you copied a newcomer, you thought no one would know. Wait. Let’s talk about this. You think I’d be forgiving? Kim, explain yourself. Why did you do it? You see? I told you we should delay it. I wanted to repaint everything. You bastard! How could you! Grab him, Su-jin! Is this why you seduced me? Think about who’s tortured about this the most! It’s me! You bastard! The source he’s claimed to have killed is your source, right? We can’t verify that. Isn’t that what the police are supposed to check? Then shouldn’t you hold off until we verify it? Whether to go on the air or not is our decision. The public has the right to know. The right? How is this about rights? You can’t tell us what to do! Calm down, goddamn it! From the beginning. Tell us what happened. I first thought the tip was just a prank. But as I looked into it, I thought this was real. I mean, it could be real. That’s what I thought. So I reported on it. When I went back to meet the source-- Then? Which day and what time? How did you do the interview? If you do not cooperate, you’ll be charged with obstruction of justice. If that’s a threat, we’ll bring in our lawyers. It’s not a threat. Who’s the source and what’s his connection to the killer? He may not be dead. If we get a description, we can issue an APB. His height is... 160 to 180 centimeters. He’s in his 20s-- Or 30s, maybe 40s. He looked young for his age. He wore jeans and a T-shirt, but it looked formal. He looked pretty fit, about this wide. Buddy. Take this seriously. Male or female? -What’s his name and what does he do? -I cannot disclose that. Anonymity was part of our agreement. You must respect that, the relationship between a reporter and his source. How much did you pay him? He must have wanted something in return. Listen to this guy. -Being a cop makes you God? -You can’t say whatever you like. Is the source also a criminal? You had such a big scoop but couldn’t contact the police. We didn’t talk about that. Weren’t you curious? You’re a reporter, after all. There is due process. Look here. We gave you everything we got. It’s your turn. What exactly have you given us? You gave us absolutely nothing! Tell me how you met the source. Your film evidence of the killer was blurry. The license plate wasn’t even visible! You expect me to believe this shit? The murderer sends you a letter saying he killed the source? You want me to believe this crap? We never asked you to! We don’t care if you believe us. Evidence? Isn’t that the job of the police? We could broadcast your statement! -What is it? -It crashed. What? What crashed? -Our server is down! -What? Go check it out! THE PAGE CANNOT BE LOADED Heo Moo-hyuk! Heo Moo-hyuk! Heo Moo-hyuk! Heo Moo-hyuk! Let’s dig into his background. I’ll call you back. We met around 6:00, and he said he might get the ax. -Get the ax? -Yes. -He wanted to go drinking. -Where did you go? A seafood joint. Welcome. Did he get any calls there? Did he have any meetings afterwards? Good evening. There wasn’t anything special. Morning news is at 6:00, so they met before 4:00. And he was drinking till 11:00? -He didn’t have any appointments. -How did he meet the source? Is the source really dead? His call log was empty. Where did he go after drinking? -He said he was going home. -Home? He’s been living alone a long time. By the way, how did he receive the letter? There was no postmark on it. Bike messenger? Or the killer hand-delivered it. I thought it was weird that he didn’t call it in. I heard they wanted to sit on it. Heo wanted to halt the story. Maybe they had something to hide. Think. Isn’t it odd? I’d have called the police. Right? Chief! The results are back! Okay! FORENSICS REPORT -If this tip leads to an arrest-- -A huge scoop. The biggest. This is what gets me. Think about it. There’s something there. How about some give-and-take? Show me! When I’m stabbing that woman... The handwriting is different. What? Heo! The police have issued a warrant for your arrest. -A warrant? -Come here! Chief Oh brought the force and is waiting for you! But this isn’t fair! Why are they here? Go in here! Hide! What’s this? This isn’t even blood? “Carotene, glucose, retinol, dietary fiber, folic acid. Which are found in”-- Tomato ketchup. Congratulations! The deputy’s here! Deputy Heo! DEPUTY CHIEF HEO MOO-HYUK This is the talk of the town. The serial killer recently sent a letter to a TV station. There’s even an online café that supports the killer. The members amiably call him “Colonel,” which is a reference to a novel mentioned by the killer. It’s called The Killing of Liang Chen. It became a best seller, thanks to recent events, and a major watercooler topic. Although not well known here, it’s the work of a seminal Chinese author in which a character named Liang Chen kills nine people during the Chinese Civil War. The protagonist kills himself at the end and metaphorically criticizes society. But even so, it’s disheartening that a serial killer is being praised. Isn’t it? Of course. Let’s find out how similar they are from an expert. Is the call in place? Doctor? -Good afternoon. -Afternoon. In your view, what kind of man is the killer? I’ve researched violent crimes for the past decade, but this kind of serial killer is unique. In the past two years, he has left almost no trace. And as of late, he’s not afraid of the media. He worked hard to stay hidden, but now he’s revealing so much. That’s unique. I see your point. Sending a letter to a reporter is a bold move. But this could also be a way to cover something up. Cover up? He may be pretending to be bold, but he’s afraid to be caught. So with these unnecessary threats, he’s trying to divert the cops. SERIAL KILLER VIDEO Here’s another interpretation. He wants his presence known. It’s his legacy. By seeing his name in the media, he fulfills something in himself-- THE KILLING OF LIANG CHEN ...and we can’t predict what he’ll do in the future. In conclusion, he’s afraid that his identity is revealed. It’s all an act to hide his true identity. -Mr. Heo. -Yes? According to this analysis, the killer is interested in media exposure, so there is a high probability that he’s listening right now. Could you say a few words? Yes. If you are listening, please turn yourself in. For the sake of the victims and their family members, I hope... you turn yourself in as soon as possible. Su-jin, look. It feels good seeing me fail? How could you say that? You were against me working. You said Kim looked like a con artist. You tried so hard to stop me. Don’t be like that. I’m sure he’s regretting this... and in so much pain. Are you teasing? Of course not. This is killing me too! Su-jin, let’s get back together. There isn’t much to life. You don’t have to be somebody big. Even if someone succeeds, they all live in bleakness. We’ll console each other and enjoy the small pleasures. Please, honey, I’ll do my best. I’ll do my absolute best. Let’s console each other and enjoy the small pleasures and take one day at a time. I’ll do my best. Give me one last chance. Were there any die-hard fans who came to see the play? Our audience grew recently due to the murder case. But die-hard... However, the main actor gets into the character so well, his neighbors think he’s a real killer. The police get reports from the neighbors several times a day. When will the others arrive? They’ll be here soon. What is it? Should we wait and meet him? I’m fucking starving. Should we wait for the main actor? That bastard. What’s all this? I’ve got it. -I’ll do it. -I’ll do it. I don’t remember this place being a castle! Bed! Choe Jeong-ho: How could a reporter lie like that? Choe Jeong-ho? Huh? Nothing. It’s nothing. Sleep. CALL ANSWERING Hello? The police? What’s going on? At least tell me what’s going on. Let’s talk there. We got stuff to check too. Just so you know, I won’t say anything without my lawyer. Why not? I got a right to protect myself. Take a look at the scene first. We’re here. Get out, please. -Let’s go. -Get out. Mr. Heo, welcome. Bring it over. Know what it is? DONGIL INN -Ever been there? -No. What is it? It was found on the source’s body. This was found this morning and sent to Forensics. It has over 20 stab wounds, which means he went berserk because he was the source. What? He said he’d kill the source. Now we have a body. Who are you referring to? A few witnesses saw a strange red vehicle here. The method of killing is the same. He used a saw blade, not an ordinary knife. It’s far more painful and tears the body up. You’ll know when you see the body later. For the sake of his family, keep it off-the-record. -I’d appreciate your cooperation. -Yeah. What’s going on? They can smell a body from miles away. Bring the camera! Keep them back! Keep them back! -Is it the source? -Don’t come down here! Mr. Heo, we’re ready for you. Is he the source? Mr. Heo? Yes? Is this your source? Mr. Heo? Well, I mean... Don’t you recognize him? It’s not him? It’s him. Deceased Choe Jeong-ho, verified by Heo Moo-hyuk. What did you say? What? His name... Choe Jeong-ho? Thirty-seven years old. He was ID’d at the crime scene. Choe Jeong-ho. His name is Choe Jeong-ho. Can you look him up? He has an account here. The phone is 123-456, so it’s fake, but there’s an address. Would you like that? APARTMENT Routing to your address. -Could we talk? -I’ve got nothing to say. Just a little. -Let go. -How are you? Su-jin, my feelings were real! -Security! He’s bothering me! -It’s torture for me. -Let her go! -One moment, please. -Have you told your husband? -Mister! Does he know? He has to know! You can’t hide it! Su-jin! You’ve arrived at your destination. REPAIR REAL ESTATE OFFICE Oh! Good afternoon. I got hungry while waiting, so I went to get some food. Have you eaten? Who are you? You should thank me. I’m the only one who knows about your lies. And thanks to me, the source’s body popped up. Good, huh? It was so hard picking him out. I wanted to do it right, so I read your articles over and over. It was harder to find an ordinary-looking man. Wasn’t it great? Did the police say anything? So you... killed Choe. Why did you do it? To make your reports look true. I watched all your segments, every single one. I lost count how many times I watched them. Oh, yeah. I read the book too. I’m pretty dumb, so I don’t read much. But now I get why adults tell us we should read. It’s a whole new world. Things that existed in my head are all here. It felt like a high. Like starting my life over. Getting help, consolation. This book explains my despair and misery. It’s all in these pages. Isn’t the colonel cool? Others may not recognize it, but I know. I understand his thoughts and what kind of person he was. It’s an honor that people are comparing me to him. I’ve wasted my life so far. But thanks to you and him, I finally feel alive. I don’t understand. I now have a purpose in life. You told me how I should live my life. Let’s make this real. We have to do this. People must never know that this case is fake, right? I’ll end it like the novel. If a body surfaces, you can say it’s me. What body? I must die like Colonel Liang Chen. People don’t doubt you. You have their trust. And only you know me, so only you can identify me. Can you do it? No. Why not? That is not the truth. It’s a con. Con? Really? What you did was a con. You sold me to the world and became rich and famous. Pretty wife and a baby on the way too. Did you research me? It’s all over the Internet. Isn’t this good for you too? -If I get arrested, it’s over for you too! -I have to go. The truth is, you want everything that has happened to be true! Right? You knew who’d be here. Weren’t you scared? If you used me, shouldn’t you pay me back? -It wasn’t like that. -It’s not hard. Just a few words will do. You need to identify me. When the body pops up, say “It’s the killer!” That’s all it takes. No. I can’t do it! This is the police. Can I help? -Listen please! -Go ahead. Hello? I-- Yes, go on. Hello? Goddamn it! Fuck. Oh, fuck! DONGIL INN This is it. Choe Jeong-ho? Yeah, he lived here. I haven’t seen him in two, three days. He went bankrupt because of his debts and became a recluse. Could he have sent in tips for money? Did anyone visit recently? Maybe he met someone. Nobody came to see him. Whenever he got some money, he and Mr. Suh would drink, get loud and piss all over the street. They’re a nasty bunch. Mr. Suh? Is he here? It’s been empty for two, three days too. They’re both the same. Open this door. Damn it! Should’ve been careful! Clean that up! -Where have you been? -You know. I need five orders of noodles. Okay, I’m on it. -Two orders of spicy noodles too! -Got it! Honey! Honey! What is it? I contacted Ms. Ko. Stay with her for a few days. -What’s going on? -It’s nothing. I’m going to tell your husband everything. I love you. I’ll explain everything later. It’s just for three days. Did Mr. Kim give you anything? Is that why? Who? I can explain. It’s all a misunderstanding. Pack your bag. What’s going on? Please tell me. I’ll call you later. Where were you just now? I went to my place for a bit. Then I’ll stay there. I’ll hide there, all right? It’ll be better at Ms. Ko’s. Don’t go anywhere. -You didn’t need to come out. -Mr. Heo, what’s happening? It’s not a big deal. Pregnancy can cause her to be sensitive. Searching recent destinations. UNKNOWN LOCATION Got another one. This belonged to the seventh victim. -Chief! -Yeah? Suh didn’t show up to work for three days. He’s never done this before. His boss asked me about his whereabouts. We should send out an APB. If he’s away for three days, he’s gone dark. Chief, it’s CNBS. What for? Hello? Hey, Heo! Why are you here now? The director is waiting downstairs. Where the hell have you been? -What’s going on? -The killer sent us a letter. His name is Suh Doo-ho. It’s even got his address. What kind of letter? It’s a will. He’s going to kill himself. Like Liang Chen in the novel. The director and the station chief are waiting. We’re going live with breaking news. Move it! This is breaking news. CNBS has received a letter claiming to be from the killer. The suspect is revealed to be 39-year-old Suh Doo-ho. We’ve decided to disclose the letter because you have the right to know. The following are Suh’s own words. They do not reflect the views of CNBS. Now. Station chief, please read the letter. I will read the original letter from the killer right here right now. “The pain is over. No more suspicion, no more sorrow. The time is near. There’s nothing more sacred than choosing my own exit. I will close my eyes. I will let go of everything and embrace the burdens of my fate. That is the final answer I received. It will be the most humane and beautiful exit of this journey. It will be lonely and painful... SUH DOO-HO SENT SUICIDE NOTE TO CNBS ...but it’ll be like a ray of hope at the end of a storm. Death cures all evil. I’ll take it all with me. There is beauty and sorrow inside tragedy. Very good. Pure pain is inside sorrow. All preparation is done. Zoom in on the will! At this moment, I am at peace. I die, you live. Only God knows what is better. Those eight people that I killed will find peace and serenity like I did. Heo Moo-hyuk, who has been my eyes and ears, I hope he will find peace and serenity too. From the Colonel.” It’s the same as Liang Chen’s will. In the novel, the colonel hangs himself-- at the scene of his first murder. Check the indoor fishing facility and secure it! -Now! -Move! Move! Here they come! We have the right to an explanation! Give us a comment! You have to tell me! Just one word! The indoor fishing place in Guri! Director. We got Suh’s mug shot! The APB is out. Go live! Now. The police have issued an APB for Suh Doo-ho. He is a mentally unstable person who is planning suicide. Please call the police if you see the suspect. He’s 39 years old, with three prior convictions, 185 centimeters, weighing 90 kilograms, muscular build. Although he’s from Gwangju, he resides in Seoul, so he does not have an accent. That’s exactly what Heo said. -He’s from Gwangju. -He was right. Gwangju. Suh Doo-ho is suspected of taking eight innocent lives. Thirty-nine... Spectacular! Amazing work, ma’am! He’s not the killer! Director, it’s not him! This man is not the killer! -What are you talking about? -Director... I talked to the killer. That’s not him. Something’s gone horribly wrong. This cannot go on the air. Please pull the plug. -You met the killer? -Yes. I’m absolutely certain Suh isn’t the killer. Explain yourself. After the APB report, Heo’s going on air. No, Director. I can’t go on the air! We got the wrong man! The APB was issued by the police. It’s going nationwide. Our ratings are over 15%. You know what that means? How did you meet the killer? What did he say? Can you get ready? Heo, where are you going? You gotta get ready! The serial killer suspect... See you tomorrow. Later. Your tip is of the utmost importance. Thirty-nine years of age, 185 centimeters, no accent. Here? Yes. -Chief, there! The red car! -Shit! Could he be alive? We gotta catch him before he kills himself. -Don’t provoke him. Go in quietly. -Yes, sir! You two, go to the other side. Those sons of bitches! -Keep it quiet! -Don’t enter! Don’t get out! Hurry! Hurry! Let’s go! Let me talk to Chief Oh! I need to speak to him! I have to meet with him! It’s not Suh! Cancel the APB! I met the serial killer! He’ll kill Suh and frame him for the murders! Heo! Heo! What do you mean? You’re after the wrong man. Suh’s not the killer! He’s manipulating us to frame an innocent man. He’s in Yongsan. I talked to him! -Something about Yongsan. -Yongsan? What’s with you? It’s exactly as you said. He’s from Gwangju. That’s the connection with the source. We got evidence from Suh’s room! Evidence? It’s fake. Suh’s not committing suicide. He’s going to kill Suh. When Suh dies, this case is over. -He’ll get away-- -Let’s talk after we get Suh. This is a mistake. Chief! Chief! Please tell us something. Someone got framed? Lee, take the right! Suh Doo-ho! Nothing? He’s not here. Back’s clear. Are they police? Su-jin, are you at Heo’s? Forget Kim and just come back. I’m on my way. It’s pointless. I’ll be there soon. Sure. Hey, mister! There’s a man locked up! I think he’s hurt. -Someone’s locked up? -Yes, I saw him. Seriously? -That can’t be. -I saw him inside. No one’s there. -There he comes! -Chief! Chief! Did we get played by Suh? You got nothing? Don’t write anything. I know who you are! -Get in! -Mister. Release him. Someone may have seen Suh. So be thorough. Got it? Send a surveillance team to Gwangju. -Got it? -Yes, sir. Heo Moo-hyuk! One word! One word! -Tell us something! -Wait! Wait! He’s upstairs. There’s nothing there. I don’t hear anything. I’m not lying. I saw him. What are you doing here anyway? What? People don’t come here much. This is a dangerous area, a lot of crime. And it looks like you’re pregnant. You might get hurt. What? You have to lead the way. I don’t know where to go. I’m... really sorry. I think I’m mistaken. Huh? I’m sorry. There’s no one there. I’m really sorry. What are you talking about? Miss! Why are you running? Miss! Can’t you provide support there? We’re too far away. Hold on. I’ll call back. The fishermen don’t know Suh. They’ve never seen him. -Yongsan... -Sir? Huh? Why are you here? Oh, shit! What the hell are you doing? What the-- Let him go and turn yourself in! Son of a bitch! You bastard! You okay? Breathe! Breathe, come on! Suh Doo-ho? Suh Doo-ho! Stay back! We’re on the same side. Right? Right! Stay back, you son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Get up. You son of a bitch! Stop this at once! Just stop! It’s all pointless! The police know everything! So stop this. Turn yourself in. Please do that. I’ll help. I’ll explain everything and turn myself in too. Let’s end this. Yeah, it’s all over. Everything’s over, okay? No more. Why is that... in your hand? What’s going on? What did you do to her? Why did you send your wife here? It’s dangerous. Motherfucker! Goddamn it! Motherfucker! Know what it feels like to stab someone? Know how it feels to kill someone? You think you’re so special. I can tell by the way you talk about me you know nothing about me. You’re just full of shit. You know so little. Nothing at all. Su-jin. Su-jin. Honey! Honey! Su-jin. Su-jin! Honey! Honey! Baby! Somebody help! -What the hell? -What an idiot. What the hell? Isn’t that Suh? -It’s Suh! -It’s him! You son of a bitch! Stay calm! Get him! -Get him! -Don’t move! -I got him! -On the ground! Help! I need help! -What happened? -She’s pregnant! Check her vitals and prep her for surgery! Get the monitor! Hurry! It’s not me! I’m the victim! I saw the killer’s face! You claim you’re innocent? Mr. Heo? The baby’s healthy. You may come in. Follow me. Honey. How are you? Are you awake? It’s all my fault. I’m sorry. Are you okay? I don’t know what happened. Who was he? That man... It’s okay, Su-jin. I went to your place. I wanted to tell you... I had something to tell you... I needed to tell you... It’s all over. It’s over now. Su-jin, It’s all over now. Our baby’s okay, and you’re fine. Good job. Thank you so much. I’m... I’m sorry. It’s my fault. I’m sorry, honey. I didn’t mean to deceive you. I wanted to do a paternity test, but they can’t do it during pregnancy. I thought it was really over between us. But it’s your child. She’s really yours. I’m sure. Believe me. She’s yours. I really believe that. She’s your child. I’m sorry. You’re not answering the phone. I’m sorry. Believe me. The child could be mine. You need to know what kind of woman she is. Exactly as Suh stated. Report. It’s the killer. Look at the wound. Look familiar? This is the ninth victim. I heard Suh had a neck wound. It fits the noose found on the scene. What do you want? When the APB was issued, Heo said to us, “Suh’s not the killer.” If you give us precise info, we’ll cover for you. Suh is the killer. There’s no doubt about it. Gwangju, the red car, the source and witness testimony. -Everything fits! -What about the body? Forensics stated that at least three people were there. And Suh’s handwriting does not fit the letters. So, what? What’s your angle? There is no angle. We’ll just report the truth. But nothing was revealed! Everything so far is far from the truth. What can we report? A different truth. That’s our report. Don’t mess with this! Suh is the killer! I’m certain! Hey! Come back! I said come back! We’re not done yet! Please brief us on the case! Was this another killing by the serial killer? This is part of an ongoing investigation. -What will happen to Suh? -Is he the killer? We heard Suh had alibis for all eight murders. Did you know he was abroad during the murders? Did you check his alibis before issuing the APB? -Have you checked them? -Tell us! We will conduct a thorough investigation of Suh. Isn’t he a victim? Weren’t there signs of a setup in there? Does the crime scene match Suh’s testimony? Chief, what do you think? We’re not dismissing the possibility that the killer tampered with the evidence during our investigation. -You admit the killer’s free? -Was the indoor fishing raid a failure? Wasn’t this avoidable had you listened to Heo? Shouldn’t you apologize to Heo and the victim? Apologize! Apologize! I had a black bag over my head, but someone came in. And I heard sounds of struggle. I think he was trying to help me. But while they were fighting, I was choking, and I passed out for a short time. When I came to, the killer was beside me holding a knife. It was no ordinary knife. It was big and weird. It had a sharp saw blade. The killer was standing here, and my savior was in front of me. He looked big and round. He was already bleeding from his head. And I was so scared. So I just ran. So while you ran, your savior was killed? He died... instead of me. If it wasn’t for him, I would have died identified as the serial killer. He’s a hero! He was covered in blood. He wasn’t even recognizable. HAN SEUNG-WOO, THE NINTH VICTIM, VOLUNTEERED THREE DAYS PRIOR... He was a kind soul. I can’t believe he’s gone. Rest in Peace, Han Seung-woo. Such a nice guy, died too early. After watching the interview, I cried. Good morning. -Good morning. -Hello. -Was it a daughter? -Yes. Is this about us not believing you? You know what it was like. We had to go with the flow of information. I first... received a call. It was a tip from a woman. -Her Korean was awkward. -Enough. I thought it was real. Everything fit. -Stop. -I need to explain. Stop it! I knew what you reported wasn’t entirely the truth, at least not for me. But that’s news. Figuring out the truth isn’t our job but the viewers’. If they believe it to be true, then it’s the truth. Stop being self-righteous. Take it back. RESIGNATION LETTER Our ratings went up to 15%, right? Adjust that for advertising slots. We’ll increase the ad rate by 15%. Let Marketing know. Sir, this came for you. SEOUL GENETICS RESEARCH CENTER PATERNITY TEST RESULT DEPUTY CHIEF - CURRENT AFFAIRS Deputy! Go to Yeouido now!
