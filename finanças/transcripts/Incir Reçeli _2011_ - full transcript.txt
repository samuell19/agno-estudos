Good morning, Shakespeare! Cellular phones restrict freedom! You owe me breakfast. Duygu Good Morning My Left Side! Remember the song playing right now! Fig Jam Is Nice Fathers aren't Always Right Bro, can't you stand still just for a moment. Look at the photo. It is very pretentious of you taking your... ...camera everywhere you go. I've saved money for two years to buy this camera. It isn't about the camera but vision. What about mine, a pop cape? Wait! Don't move! Don't move your hand! Here is the moment when the greatest script writer... ...gives himself to booze. Did you shoot the great script writer? What is this? I've been a moron. Although there are so many alternatives... - ... I'm picturing you. - Buzz off! Could you please plug in my phone to the charger? Perfect timing, dad! Yes daddy. I'm at my friend's place. Metin. Metin, please turn the volume down. Okay father, I'll be there soon. I am leaving. - I am going to load the photos to computer. - Sure. - Don't stay till late. - Okay, daddy. Very funny. - Where is Erol? - His daddy phoned. Silly. He toook my photos all night long. - Beer? - Okay. Ozan. Sweetie, if you don't have somewhere to stay... ...you can come to my place. We can have more drinks there. Sir, we are closed. Please leave. One moment. I am going to tell... Madam we are closed. I was telling something... Ozan, I forgot my phone, bro. I was busy that I forgot to give it back to you. - Here you are. - Thanks bro. See you. See you, bro. Hop hop golden ball. That is only game I love among all. Miss, if you wish our security can take you to your home. I can go by myself. No, I can't. They can take you to your place if you'd like. - Where do you live? - At home. I am kidding. - Mr. Ozan, will you intervene? - Bro, what shall I do? - Have you got any money? - Why? Do you want to borrow some? He took all of them. - Where do you live? - Galata. Very close. Can I stay with you? - Ozan! - Shall I leave her by the door? What is this, a newspaper? It was just an idea, bro, why are you getting mad? We'll talk about your ideas later. It seems that we are going to my place, young lady. - Bag. - Bag. - Have a good day, Metin. - Have a good day, Ozan. We'll talk. - But no sex. - No puke. - No sex. - No puke. No sex. Done. No sex. No sex. - Good morning, Mr. Metin. - Good morning, Cemil. Last night we watched your sketches again. We laughed a lot. How can you create so much humour? - From my ass! - Sure. Here is your bread. - Have a great day. - Thanks. You Owe Me Breakfast. Duygu Glad to meet you. I am Metin. There is no love in it. Yes, you wrote about a couple likes each other but... ...it is not living, it is cold, understand? Cold. However, even if you write a greatest love story... ...it doesn't worth much in these days. Look, if you want to write about something... ... it should worth money. You should write a bawdy comedy. Use your brain, son, people laugh at those. Poor boy and rich girl method was in the past. People have so many problems lately. People are after bread money and seek... ... something to laugh at. Who gives a fuck to other people's love? You write so many sketches to TVchannels. Choose a type among them. Write a script about the rich and sexy so we produce. Mr. Metin, if you don't need the other pages... - Thanks Mr. Metin. - No big deal. Mr. Metin! I wanted to ask you something. I couldn't find the last two pages of your last script. Kids have lost them. Are they getting married at the end? - Girl runs away. - Really? She is a wishy-washy indeed! She has run after him... - Cemil, shall we talk later? - Alright, no problem. - But now... - Cemil! Alright, Mr. Metin. Have a great day. You have a surprised look on your face but it's Okay. So how are you, bro? How was your meeting? Really? So do we have so many planes again? Fuck it, bro! All the great artists were appreciated after they were dead. I just wanted to make a jOke. What happened to the girl last night, Metin? Give me a beer now. He asked a question, answer him! Nothing, bro. She was gone when I woke up. Clean job, bro. The ideal woman is the one who is absent when you wake up. No, bro. We didn't sleep together. I slept on the couch. - If she was not going to give... - Give what? - Give what, Erol? - Give what, Lisa? A friend of mine owes me some money. He refuses to pay back. If he isn't going to pay it back... ...why did he get it, bastard? - You look sad. - He has so many paper planes again. You can always write new ones. How do you say; my shop is here. You became a Turk just in two years! Don't move! You owe me a breakfast. Can I get the same one? - Your face is familiar. - Do I need to throw up to remind you? - Alright, I remember. - Correct answer. Look, we get on well. - Thanks. - But this time don't forget to save some for cab. I'll take it before I leave. Thank you. Good morning. - Breakfast is not proper without fig jam. - I hate it. - Didn't you spend all your money last night? - I lied. - I set up the radio. Did it turn on? - I noticed. It is good to wake up with music. You start the day with more energy. The janitor told me that you are a script writer. That's what he believes. - Here. - I don't like. Electricity is off. - Has any of your scripts been filmed? - Yes, all. - Really? - I've shot them all in my head. Very funny. I've seen a guitar in your room. Can you play? - A little. - Will you play for me later? - No. - Why not? My father has told me that... ...doing one thing proper is better than doing... ...many things a bit. So, I've chosen script writing. Fuck! - Sketches! - What sketches? I am writing a sketch for a TV talk show. Yes? Good morning. I'm fine and you? Thanks. It's ready. - Ready. - He is lying! - I'll send you in fifteen minutes. - He is lying! - Okay, I am going to send it soon. - He's lying! Alright. Thanks. Have a good day. I have to write those sketches. There is no electricity. I need to go to an internet caf?. This pepper is so strong. - Take the key, I am going out too. - Okay. I forgot to take her phone number. Fathers aren't always right! Fig Jam Is Nice I wish you'd have written down your... ...phone number too. - Good luck, Uncle Salih. - Thank you Metin. Cemil, leave raki on the table. My hands are busy. Okay, Mr. Metin. Cemil, we would drink together if you wouldn't blush. I asked but he doesn't drink alcohol. Cemil's voice. I can do it again. Okay, Mr. Metin. Will we pretend like strangers outside? You had a friend, I didn't want to bother. He is a family friend. - Do you live with your family? - No. - Where is your family? - In ?zmir. - Nice city. Why are you here? - I came here to study. - After? - After I graduated I worked in bars for a long time. I was giving away what I wrote. Then I started to write TV sketches. How do you feel of your sketches... ...being watched by people? I don't know. That should be asked to the actors. They are the ones recognized on the streets. A grocery store wouldn't give me anything without paying. The janitor Cemil appreciates you much. According to me everyone should has someone to appreciate. Whom do you appreciate most? By the way, if you give me your phone number I can call... Good morning, Shakespeare! Cellular phones restrict freedom! Remember the song playing right now! ... there are so many reasons... ... didn't pity on me... I'm burning with your flames... ... come and put off my fire with your skin my love. I am taking your photos. Aren't you gonna pose or something? Something I like this or that? Sorry, Liza. No, this is not normal. There is something about you A girl? - What's her name? - Duygu. - What's her profession? - I don't know. - Is she a student? - I don't know. - Where does she live? - I don't know. Very well. Are you planning to have kids? Bro, first you get to know each other and then you'll tell us. Now, shoot. - What was playing on the radio? - "Psychopath". It is our song now. May get a beer? - "Psychopath"? - Yes. Should it be something depressing instead? I recognized your face which is familiar... ... welcome to my heart my dear... ... sorry about the mess around here. - Good morning. - Good morning. I wanted to prepare breakfast before you sneak out. This time I had no intention to sneak out. Really? Then I wokee up so early for nothing. - C'mon, breakfast is on me then. - Okay. Good Morning My Left Side This place only serves breakfast. You can have it at any time of the day. Everything is so fresh here. Even the clotted cream is homemade. - Bon appetite. - Thanks. Thanks. - What is the tattoo on your arm stands for? - An angel. I did it myself. After my mum's death. - How did it happen? - It hurt a bit. - I meant your mum. - Committed suicide. I can do one for you if you want. - What? - Tattoo. I have no idea. I can't think of something so valuable to carve on my skin. For instance we can make a feather pen. Wouldn't be so flashy for a person who... ...writes only sketches to TV channels? You never talk about yourself. My name is Duygu. I'm 25 years old. I'm joining your lives from Istanbul. You know about my mum. My father lives in the country. I don't have any siblings. I like your company and fig jam. - Are you excited? - No. I am only worried that your questions might be hard. Cowards die many times before their deaths. - Fuck! - What? I forgot to buy cigarettes. I'm gonna get a pack. You prepare the table... - Okay? - Okay. I recognized your face which is familiar... ... welcome to my heart my dear... ... sorry about the mess around here. Sorry. - Do I need to say something? - You don't need to. Talking is not for you. You leave without saying anything, don't you? You depart in such a manner that one's breathing is... ...left half finished, let alone he is living. You don't tell anything that millions can be told on that. You don't tell me anything, Duygu. You just go. - I didn't go. - Wrong. You have never come. I've created a woman in my mind and... ...lived with her passionately. Probably people laugh at me for talking to myself. You don't exist. - I didn't go but ran away. - Ran away from me? Did you run away from a guy who never touched you... ...although slept with you in the same bed many times. I ran away from that. Do you understand? I would love to have your point of view. What was I seeing? There is no address, no phone. I go to bed with you and when I wake up you are gone. The most important... Do you know what is the most important? That I smelled your scent. That I fall in love to a real person for the first time... Other than the silly characters I've created. - I... - I tell you. You are egoist. I am HIV positive. I mean, I am AIDS. Treatment of AIDS You can ask me everything dear. I just want to know how... They only try to extend the duration of life. Infection occurs by sexual intercourse and blood transfer. It doesn't spread with towel, knife, fork, spoon or water. It doesn't spread with skin contact or hand shake. According to researches only one person was infected by kissing... ...because they both had severe teeth bleeding. Although only one person it still is a risk. During the last period of the sickness... ...male patients have lesions but my skin will remain smooth. In fact no one dies because of AIDS. HIV infects primarily vital cells in the human immune system. Even if an individual catches cold can't resist it and dies. - Any more questions? - No. After this appetiser briefing can we... ...start breakfast now? Why don't you get treatment? Do you think I've never tried? In this country even doctors do not shake... ...hands with HIV positive people. No need to mention the rest of the society. When treatment starts it is heard immediately. If you have known how people will react after learning it... ...you would be regretful for talking about the treatment. - How about your father... - He knows. I guess he is the only one who really understands me. How long an AIDS patient can survive if gets treatment? Not AIDS, HIV positive. By taking handful of pills daily you can... ...live for a long time. Doesn't a longer time which we can spend... ...together mean something for you? We can't spend that time together, darling. Once I restart treatment this will be heard and... ...do you think they will treat you differently... ...while you are with me. You still didn't ask me how I was infected? I am scared to face the person who caused you this. Stop! Stop it my love! I beg you to stop! Stop. I can't do this to you. This is very difficult my love. I wish I was immortal. While refusing treatment? I didn't mean death. I meant immortality. I was going to eat that. ... there are so many reasons... one of them is the lover... ... didn't pity on me... I'm burning with your flames... ... come and put off my fire with your skin my love. I used to play hide and seek with my friends... ...when I was a kid. I was scared that they would not find... ...me where I hide. While I was waiting I needed to pee. I used to leave my hiding place with that excuse. They always accepted my excuse and never tagged me. After I've learnt my sickness I started to hide. Never gone out of the place where I was hiding. I needed so many things but grinned and bear it. Because people are harsh, impatient. They would immediately tag me. Then you came. You reached the underneath of the bed where I was hiding. I was seeking a place to hide. Here is too narrow. Too dark. Here is painful. Go! I found you. I saw you. I touched you. Touching you is like having a break in life. Touching you is like breathing. Touching you is like burning all the words. Touching you is like forgiving the whole mankind. Touching you is like cleaning up the life. Touching you is like challenging death. - Is raki in the fridge? - In the fridge. - What did you do today? - Nothing, my Shakespeare. Just visited some book shops. What about you? Nothing else but sent out the sketches. Fish is well fried. Raki must be cold by now. I'll go and get it. You know, just because of this reason I couldn't ask Duygu. I had no idea what to do... ...when I met the animal who infected her this. I still don't know. It is difficult to tell this but... ...I really wanted you to be healthy in front of me. I'd love to hurt you. But you have nothing to lose, don't you? You can't even reply me. Because you are finished. You are dying. C'mon tell me something. Give me a reason to unplug you. C'mon tell me something. Talk to me! Say "I poisoned the only woman you loved". Say "Every day before you I am melting the... ...only woman you loved". Say "I'm dying and don't give a shit about you". Say "I fucked your life"! Tell me something. Tell me something so I'll get rid of the rock inside me. Tell me something so I can breathe. Tell me something. Tell me something. - Metin, you are early today. - Give me a beer. - Something bad happened? - Bad? Darling... Darling... Metin bro, if you'd like one of our guys can take you home. No need. I'll walk down the coast. - Fresh air might refresh me. - As you wish. What are we are tossing for, love? Tossing for what? We are drinking for the losers, love. That's me. Or wait a minute. Changed my mind. Today we are drinking for the death of... ...the killer of our love. The killer who struggling among cables. Sooner or later he will die. Death will be a survival for him. - Whom are you talking about? - About your ex. About my executioner. While I was scared to face him you led me to him. Did you follow me? I was worried that you would run away again. My thick head may understand everything. Anything can happen. One can face anything. But your desire for a mature guy... Is your body that cheap? Do you know what is really cheap? Your easily made judgements which don't value anything. Good morning babe. Your mouth smells like my shoes. You can't come to breakfast like this. The whole place stinks like a shoe. I was wondering why there were no vermin here? Of course they wouldn't stay here. Poor things must have fled. Are you re-writing "Love Story"? If I don't drop by we can't see each other. Why don't you call and ask me... ...if I am okay and need anything or when is my first exhibition? Which I am not planning to have one soon. But still I expect you to ask me. If I don't pop by we'll loose communication. You are very untidy, man. Have you become senile? There are notes everywhere. Fuck! You writers are unreliable. You don't even like fig jam. Erol, you are like a sewing machine at this time of the day. We need to find you a girl friend, bro. She shouldn't be around so much but come time to... ...time to tidy up your ass. You're lucky to have me for dropping by to fix your ass. I shouldn't have forgotten the powder sugar but still tasty. By the way... ...here is my first photo shot with my new camera. I printed the date and my signature at the back. Thanks. Thanks? Is this how you respect an artist? What a shame! I can't stay in this environment any more. I go to my course where I perform my art. Don't bother to show me to the door. See you in the evening. What are you doing with my shoes? Are they yours'? I am sorry, I thought the owner had already died... Drop them immediately! Mr. Metin, any garbage? Anyway, I'll drop by later. Scene 1 - Shall I take you home? - I can go by myself. - Get in there but don't vomit! - No sex! No sex! Good morning, Shakespeare Cellular phones restrict freedom! Fathers aren't always right! My sorrow is here... ... not in the pouring rain... not in the lying autumn... ... not in empty streets. My body is thrown... ... time lost in your hair... ... my eyes watch the streets... ... the reason is rebellious love. I am burning inside I am bleeding inside... ... what is left behind is handful... ... you left me in sorrow... ... my mind blown. Can I help you? There was a sick person here. - I... - Mr. Selim. He was my tenant. He passed away. I am lookng for the girl who used to visit him. His daughter Duygu. She left here after her father's death. Daughter? What are you doing, bro? Have you lost your mind? You answer my call and then do whatever... Only one person was infected AIDS by kissing. My father is the only person who really understands me. She left here after Mr. Selim's death. Fig jam is nice. Metin! What are those, bro? If you have satisfied your curiosity you may go. How can I go leaving with you like... Erol, fuck off! You see I am alive. Now go. - Metin! - Fuck off, Erol! If you need anything call me, bro. I would love to write like you. I think you writers are born to be a writer. I mean you don't live what you write mostly. The script writer of ET didn't see an ET. Cheers! Can you pass me the water, darling? People are like rain drops striking a windscreen. While some drops are going down it mixes up... ...with more drops and its movement gets stronger. I've mixed with you my love. People are cruel, wasteful. They behave as if everything is everlasting. One day... ...they don't think that the driver may open the window. I love you. I wish I was immortal. I wanted to be immortal. While refusing treatment? I didn't mean death. I meant immortality. Voyage of an AIDS patient. Said "While carrying the death in her pocket... ...she wanted to be immortal". Fig Jam We are shooting. Okay, thanks. If there will be any developments we'll call you. Even if it is negative please let me know so... ...I won't wait for nothing. Sure. Have a great day. I worked on the scenes you gave me. It seems to be a nice story. But why on earth this girl loves fig jam so much? That seems silly. What is so important you want to tell me? In fact I wanted to tell you this before... Tell what? Two years ago you came to Istanbul for a week. Why didn't you go back? Love. Love of Istanbul. But I couldn't find the love I was seeking in Istanbul. - So I decided to return home. - Return? I've already stayed a lot. One shouldn't push her luck so much. One should see the other countries and cities too. You are right. One shouldn't push luck so much. - Would you like fig jam? - I don't like. How do you feel playing an AIDS patient? Did you have difficulty in making sex scenes. When will you shoot the sequel? Dr. Tayfun is the AIDS couch of our actress. Congratulations. Great script. You, you know her. I've seen you with her. Where is she? - Tell me! - Yurt Hospital. I found you my love. Open your eyes. Please open your eyes. Forgive me. I behaved like the others. Please open your eyes. Open and forgive me my love. You are now immortal. - Welcome darling. - I found you! Get me out of here. When my father brought this disease... ... to our home I wasn't born yet. My mum thought that she was milking me for months. When she learnt about my father's cheating and... ... her poisoning me she refused treatment. I wasn't lying when I told you she committed suicide. I am going my mum's way. Instead of living a longer life while being excluded from society... I preferred living a shorter life like an ordinary person. Docs say that I'll die because of influenza. Funny isn't it? This illness kills while living. They didn't give me any right to love something alive. So I loved fig jam. Fig jam was you, my love. Now close your eyes. Think about the good things you'll do. I am not telling that you should forget me... ...because I wouldn't forget you. But never cross with life. I'll be with you whatever you will do. In the mornings you'll again wake up with the radio. You'll get out of bed with energy and... ...turn down the radio. Then you'll open the window and stretch... ...yourself through outside There are thousands outside waiting for your stories. They all expect to be understood, like me. Write my love. Continuously. Tell them each other. Tell them how beautiful to touch each other. Tell them to mix up with each other. Tell them what they forget during the life cycle. Tell them about making love. Tell them how to become a single body even in the worst moment. Dying alone is difficult. Tell them the easiest way. Now, open your eyes my love. I promise you. Everything will be fine. I am mixed with you my love. Now you are now stronger. Tell them one day the driver suddenly may open the window. Fig Jam
