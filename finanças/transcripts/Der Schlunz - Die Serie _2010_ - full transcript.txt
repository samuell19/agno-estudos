Schlunz! * Recently, something is going on. * * We're having lots of fun. * * Since Schlunz moved in with us. * * It'll never be the same as before. * * We hope he stays with us for a long time. * * We hope he stays with us, Schlunz. * * He stays with us. * * He's funny and clever, Schlunz. * * And even more a friend and helper. * * That's why we do everything we can * * so that our friend can stay here. * * We hope he stays with us a long time. * * We hope he stays with us, Schlunz. * * He stays with us. * * Schlunz. * He was anxious and scared when we found him in the woods. He'd lost his memory. All he knew was that he was called "Schlunz". The police said that he could stay with us until they found his parents. But Rosenbaum wants to put him in the orphanage. Turbulent times, I tell you. "Schlunz - The Series" From an idea of Harry Voss Direction & Script - Rainer Hackstock Episode 10: THE DECISION - Hit the gas. - Doesn't work. Come on, hit the gas. It doesn't work. You broke it. This was your idea. Not true at all. - Hey, man! - Hey, stop it. What the heck? Just look at you two! Hit the shower. Mrs. Rosenbaum could be here any moment. What does she want? She didn't give any details. But she said it was very important. We're on our way. So, Dr. Profundus is a qualified psychologist. He works as a Juvenile Court Expert and will form a neutral opinion about the time the boy has spent living here with you and your family. Therefore it is necessary, to hear the opposite side... I mean, of course, to listen to the views of the children. Exactly, that's right. And what is the purpose of the report? It is used to help make a final decision about whether the boy stays with the family or not. So you can ensure that Schlunz is allowed to stay with us? Well, it's not quite that simple. But you support us, right? Dr. Profundus supports no one. He is neutral. He'll simply gather and organize all the information. Oh well. Let's start. What do you want to know? From the beginning? Mr. Schmidtsteiner, if you don't mind, we'd love to talk with the young people in private. Can you organize this, somehow? Organize? Well, then let's organize. We'll just leave you alone. So, the main topic of our conversation will be: The events involving property damage and personal injury. The first question would be: How does one actually get the idea to shoot at a dedicated local authority from a tree? Yes. Well, it kinda started with a New Year's rocket, which fell from a cupboard. On New Year's Eve, everybody fires rockets... During the year only the professionals. Because it is forbidden. At what angle should I shoot it? What do you think? Just do it before someone sees us here. Yeah, yeah. - Crap. - What? Is it the Police? Even worse, it's Nele. Oh, crap. She knows our bikes. What are you doing? Cycling. No one can stop me. - You two are so mean. - Why? Because I can play soccer too. - That never happened before. - Great, Nele. Wonderful. Crap. You'll have the ladder back in ten minutes. Thank you. Ok, I'll light it now. And then we run away, so that nobody suspects us when it blows. Ok? Ok. It doesn't work. What are you doing? I kicked the ball into the tree. Aha. Well, come on. Let me do it. You're too little. - No I'm not. - Get down. Immediately. Let's get out of here! Mrs. Rosenbaum, get down! Quickly! I don't think you can boss me around. Oh, no. Who did that? I want an answer. Who was it? I just wanted to get the ball down professionally. Very professional. You must have been very angry then, Mrs. Rosenbaum. Certainly. Well, it's understandable. Yes, of course. However, I'm not the judge, here. I just want to get an objective picture. All right. Were there any more incidents? You bet! We've just started. You won't believe how he badgered me: a passionate coin collector. Pass. The pleasure is all mine. That's it. What's wrong with you? First the lawn tractor, then the chocolate cream, and now this. That was just an accident. Lukas, how will it ever work out with Schlunz, if you join in his nonsense? We just wanted to play soccer. "Just." You say that every time. Especially for you, I had higher hopes. I am very disappointed in you. Oh yeah? And I'm disappointed in you. You only have eyes for your coins, and crazy Rosenbaum. I don't have to put up with that. Not in that tone. This is really going too far. This is too much. - I'm going away. - Away where? Just away. Then we'll see if he is happier without me. Did we get them all? Yes. What luck. I am really glad... No! One of the Roman coins is missing. Emperor Augustus. - Hey, where are you going? - We're going abroad. - Where is that? - No one knows. Far, far away, where no one else goes. Cool, I want to come along. I really do not understand. It's like it was swallowed up by the Earth. Yes, but it can't be gone. That's impossible. Did you look over there? - Cool, a hut. - Super. It's sure to be locked. No, it is open. Cool, we can stay here overnight. - Overnight? - Sure, what did you think? But today we're having pancakes. And then you want to stay here? Yes, we will. That's life abroad. You don't like pancakes? Normally I do... but now everything's changed. Right Lukas? Exactly, everything is different now. We won't ever go home. - Never? - Never. Can I have your room, then? Fine by me, just, don't touch my soccer stuff. Don't worry. Bye. - So what do we do? - Let's wait a bit? Oh, this stupid shoe has been hurting me all this time. So what is it? The stupid coin! All's well that ends well, I would say. I suppose you already came to terms. Yes, more or less. But that's still not everything. Do you know Braunfels Castle? That's where I wanted to spend two quiet days with my best friend. And whom do I meet there? At the time we had a school project about sound and wanted to make an experimental bang. - Here in the cannon, would be perfect. - But, a blast on the floor is fine too. No, you heard the Squire, the floor is very delicate Trust me. Don't, Schlunz! Amazing. Oh, look, Jutta! This cute little cannon! What? The cheap cartridge? No, this cute cannon here. Oh that is really cute. Hard to believe it was ever fired. - The Swedes are coming. - From the furniture shop? It doesn't matter. Get out! She does it again and again. - Funny. - What? The picture is crooked. Now that you mention it. But why is the picture crooked? Lift it. Oh, the secret passage. We found it. Great! Come on, up. So, search every nook and cranny. Hey. There. Finally. A miss. Oh, man. There, behind you. - Where? - There. Oh. Wow. The church treasury. We found it. So I light it to the glory of God's castle. Just drive. Don't think. Just drive. Isn't that terrible? Yes, of course. This is most appalling. Since then you probably bore a lot of anger and sadness, right? Exactly, you see it just won't do. The boy must now really finally... I understand you quite well, but I won't judge, here. Right? We'll remember. Yes... OK. Was there anything else out of the ordinary? I mean, it's already a very impressive list. Yes. There was also this very personal incident. A personal story? Would you like to talk about it, Mrs. Rosenbaum? Yes. After work I was taking a stroll through the city and suddenly - I see her. - Me? - The cat. - The cat? Yes. The porcelain cat. Oh yes, of course. Yes. Porcelain cats have some very personal meaning, yes. Just like the one I had as a child. But then I found it again. I was so happy. And then I got this call. I had to go to some excavator event. Alas, the rest the children can tell themselves. Yes, please. Go on. Well, what can I say? In the beginning, we had lots of fun with the excavator. Hello. What are the police doing here? No idea. - Hello everyone. - Good day. - Hello, Mrs. Rosenbaum. - Hello. This is quite something. - Can I try? - Yeah, sure, Schlunz. Yes, super, Schlunz. - Give me five. - Give me five. That lever! Schlunz, not this lever. Parking discreetly is fun! My cat! But Schlunz wasn't to blame. The fat cop parked way too close. Don't say fat, it's called Full-Slim. All the people saw it. Schlunz was not to blame. Yes, um, what is it now? I want the children to tell how they helped me clean my waiting room. Helped? It was a bet. It's really boring here. Shall we practice the poem again? Oh, no. Reciting it just once in my life is enough. What is that thing? A fog machine. No. Fog machines look different. I know from the school theater. - Wanna bet? - You're on. That was really my fault. Schlunz said it was a fog machine and I contradicted him. We could switch it on. Otherwise we'll never find out what it is. You don't want to turn it on. - Only for a second. - Don't, Schlunz! Mrs. Rosenbaum, I as a father, as a father of two children, have a sense for children. Oh, no. I won. This is a foam gun. Switch it off, Schlunz. Quickly! - It's not responding! - Pull out the plug! He learns so fast. And yes I think, that he's willing, to start mellowing out. This thing has no plug. It runs on batteries. Great. What do we do now? He helps other people. He is there for us. And for himself. He is athletic. Mens sana in corpore sano. (Latin: "A Sound Mind in a Healthy Body") Let's just wait. Maybe it will stop on its own, eventually. You can be completely assured. the things with Schlunz will level off, you won't even notice he's there. That would make me very happy, Mr. Schmidtsteiner. But I am, and will remain, a realist. Push. If we just hadn't turned it on... Go back. Maybe we can practice the poem again. But we already know it. But it should really stick. The kids have something... For heaven's sake. Oops. "Mrs. Rosenbaum, Mrs. Rosenbaum, Who would believe that today's the day? We wish..." All right. You know, I'm not passing judgment, here. But I sense here a kind of attraction for unfortunate situations. With you, Mrs. Rosenbaum. What? That can't be. The boy also makes a mess when I'm not there. It would be interesting to find out what was actually going on, on the day, a documentary was filmed on the outskirts of town. But we were just playing football. - Please one at a time. - So, it went like this. They were shooting a film about our city and there was a hut to be blown up. Oh? And Dad led some rich people, who donated money for the film, to the location. The house you see at the edge of the forest, is more or less a faithful reproduction of the hut of a judge who secretly hoarded his riches here. To his great misfortune, there was still a large amount of gunpowder in the hut. And then came a thunderstorm, lightning, and wham... Follow me, please. Come on, let's go. I don't want to miss the explosion. No one's going to miss the explosion. But I want to get closer. All right, just one more goal. So, that is the ignition board. This is Mr. Black, the explosives expert. And in a few minutes he will press this button. He's ready and just waiting for the Director's command. We'd better take cover. So, once again thanks for your support. And now the crucial shot for the grand championship finals. Lukas, Schlunz, no ball games here. Oh my God Oh, NO! Yes, gosh. You don't see that every day. Right? So really. Huh. Without judging. But Schlunz has also done many good things. For example, we helped Basti. Basti? A classmate. An outcast. - It didn't work, uh. - With half of the titles, the music skips. - We want our money back. - These are second-hand goods, they don't have to function at all. - Are you totally crazy now? - Into the dumpster with him. - No, let me go. Let me go. - Get in! - No, let me go. Hey, you can't just leave me in here. Get me out. - Mission? - Mission! Hey, are you helping the cheater now, or what? - You want problems? - Another time. And Schlunz and Lukas also took lots of jobs, to raise the money to replace the broken porcelain cat. Okay. So what exactly did you do? Everything possible. Out of the way. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, I think I have a pretty good picture of it all. Which is? Of course, I can't say anything yet... Unfortunately. - Just erase it. - What? It would be nice if you could just erase all the stupid things. Simply erase? Never, ever. Wait. Then Schlunz could start over from scratch. At zero. Uh huh. That reminds me of something I read in my children's Bible. May I just read it? Well, I don't know. I would really like to hear it. I thought so. One time a shrewd and important men came to Jesus. They had brought a woman who had broken the law. "Look, Jesus," they cried. "This woman is very nasty." "We have caught her breaking God's commandments." "She's full of sin and only does very bad things." "She deserves the maximum penalty." "We must stone her." And already they had begun to pick up stones, to throw them at the woman. But Jesus said: "He who is without sin, who has never done anything bad or nasty, he may cast the first stone." So the people looked at each other. None of them had always done everything right. Actually, they had all broken God's commandments. One by one, they dropped their stones and walked away. When all were gone, Jesus asked the woman: "Is there no none left who wants to condemn you?" "No, no one," replied the woman. "Then I do not condemn thee, either," Jesus said. "You are free. Today you can start over from scratch." "Live now with God and heed His commandments." Oh, how nice of Jesus. He is so much nicer than... Just a moment. As I said, we do not pass judgment, here. Just as Jesus did. But maybe you could follow the example of Jesus. A little bit at least. Excuse me? Yes, and forget everything bad that Schlunz has done, so he can start over again. Right. When Jesus forgives someone, it is like a brand-new school book, where all the pages are nice and new. We wanted to ask how long... We've just finished and it was very enlightening. You'll be hearing from us. But, can't you tell us anything now? Well, as I said before, I should not really judge, but it looks very good. The thing with the fresh start, that was really good. It's a great keyword. This is good in the Bible and good in real life. Thank you. Goodbye. Mrs. Rosenbaum, I'd like a short word with you. - Oh? - Yes, please. You know, to clear up a few things. Please tell me about your childhood. Did you maybe fall out of the crib or slip off the potty? Yes, both. How could you know? You see, maybe you should think about making some changes. Quite often in life there are moments best started all over again. - Excuse me? - Just think it over. As with a school book where the pages are nice and slim again. I mean, white. White and beautiful. Yes, like what? So. Wait a minute. Who is this about? The boy or me? - It's all about you. - It's not about me at all! - Look here! - You're the psychologist here! No, no, no. This will have consequences! You will regret it!
