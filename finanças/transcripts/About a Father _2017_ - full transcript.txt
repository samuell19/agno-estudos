ABOUT A FATHER Don't worry, my family will fall in love with you... I'll fall in love with them too. I'm already in love with them... In the morning, wait until the morning. Shhh... Wait here, I've got to pee. Jesus! Gross! Gross, don't eat that! Mom, dad, this is Adam. Good morning. I'm Adam. I'm Katerina. Jindrich! Dad, this is Adam. Adam is a teacher. Literature and P.E. Are you a good teacher, Adam? I try. If you ask me, I think that today's schools stifle the natural desire for knowledge rather than encourage it. Would you like a hotdog, Adam? No thank you... So what do you think, mom? How long are you staying? Excuse me? Well, I have to go to the city. Someone has to watch your father. Until Friday, if that's okay. C'mon, I'm happy you're here. I'm just worried about your dad. I thought you'd be happy to get to know my life partner, too. Stop exaggerating, please. How long have you known each other? Three years. And we're getting married. Right. Just don't spring that on your father, you know he's not supposed to get upset right now. Mom, dad doesn't even know I'm gay. I think he has a right to know. Don't you even think about it. He needs to take it easy until the transplant is done, do you understand? He has to take it easy! Don't you realize he could die at any moment? That's exactly why he's got to know. I said forget about it. What if dad dies and never finds out that I'm gay? Can you imagine how I would feel knowing that I lied to him my entire life? Why does he need to know? To have a reason to be proud of you? Is that it? Like this is something to be proud of? You're always waving your differences in my face. I might be able to handle that for a while but please leave your father out of it. I can't help being who I am, and I don't intend to be ashamed of it. And whose fault is it? Mine? Ours? What did we do wrong?! It's nobody's fault, it's just the way I was born. It's all about you, is that it? Well then, let's upset your father to death just so you can feel good about yourself. Who wants to upset dad? I just want to be honest with him like I am with everybody else. You are unbelievably selfish, you know that? Can I help with something? David, please buy me a salty roll there. Dad, you know you're not supposed to eat salt. You know how angry mom would be if she found out? Your mom means well, but what's the point of life if you can't enjoy the things you like? And a salty roll would help you enjoy life? Right now, yes. Is that all? You! Come here! Come here! Hey. Hey. Thanks. You're welcome. Move your fag ass! Whoa, take it easy... What the hell are you doing?! Welcome to the backcountry. Are you thirsty? I'll get some water. Adam, may I also ask you for some water? Of course. You can drink? I have to. It dilates the blood vessels. Do you like Bohemian Romanticism, Adam? You mean the 19th century? What do you think about Macha's death? Do you believe the official version? Cholera? It's a bunch of bull. In those days, cholera wiped out whole cities. But nobody around Macha got sick. How could he have gotten it? Do you have your own theory? He supposedly had a vision that he later described in a letter to a friend before his death. Is he a drinker? Mom, he only had one drink with dad. Exactly. He poured drinks for a man in critical condition. And I'm supposed to trust such a person with your father? Adam isn't like that. He's a teacher. He'd never hurt anyone. Where the hell is that dish towel? I heard he was in a fight at the pub yesterday. Hey, he was just defending me. What do we even know about him? What do you know about him? He's my fiance. Of course, don't forget to remind everyone. Veronika will stay here with them. No way. Another hour in this hole and I'll go crazy. Hey, bro, does it hurt when he fucks you in the ass? Excuse me, Veronika! If the hospital gets a suitable heart for Jindrich they'll call this cellphone. All you need to do is tell them the address and they'll send an ambulance. If he feels sick there's nitroglycerine. It goes under his tongue until it dissolves, he already knows. If you need to call an ambulance, here's a summary of the medical reports. And make sure he doesn't forget to take his regular medications after lunch. They'll be fine, mom. Dad's not five. Come on or we'll be late. Ok, let's go. I'm counting on you, Adam! Have a nice trip. Where are you going, Jindrich? Out. You didn't think we were going to be stuck inside all day in the midst of such gloriousness? We're going on a trip. A trip? Where? To Houska Castle. Did you know that during restorations a secret room was discovered in the rock that was not in the castle's floorplan and nobody in history has ever written about? You want to go to Houska? You mean the place you said Macha went and die few days later in agony? Yup, that's the one. Do you have any idea what your wife would do to me if she found out? Except she won't find out, right? Jindrich, with all due respect, this is not a good idea in your condition. It's a tough climb. That's because castles were always built on hills. Though in Houska's case nobody really knows why. Shouldn't you leave it for another time? Like... when you've got a new heart? We're living in the present, Adam. The future is not what it once was, as they say. If I had to wait for a new heart to do everything, I might not get to do anything at all. This isn't a good idea... This really isn't a good idea. Today will be a beautiful day, Adam. Glorious... It's the only nice thing about this house arrest. I know that Katerina means well, but moving to a cottage in the countryside just so I'd be far away from people is a little inhumane. But I like this. But two weeks a year would be more than enough. She wants you to take it easy. Take it easy? I'll take it easy when I'm dead! Are you OK? I haven't felt this good in a long time. You know, Houska Castle really is fascinating. There are so many mysteries linked to this place. To this day, no one has been able to discover its purpose. The castle, I mean. In the mid-13th century there were no roads leading here. There was nothing to defend. And even if there were, there would be no way to do it. There was no source of water here. Shall we sit for a bit? Good idea. Jindrich?! Oh shit! So this is how responsible your friend is? Mom, please! He would never hurt anyone! I knew it! I'm sorry. Dear David, I've been worried about you lately. You seemed a little lost, and any father faced with such a situation would do anything he could to ensure that the path his son takes is not a destructive one. But today I am no longer afraid. I am at peace and happy that you have become such a loving, sensitive, and thoughtful man. Always remain true to yourself, and be proud of yourself, at least half as proud as I am of you. I am truly happy that you have finally found your soulmate, a life partner, a person who loves you and who will be there when you need him, because that is the most important thing in life. Be happy together.
