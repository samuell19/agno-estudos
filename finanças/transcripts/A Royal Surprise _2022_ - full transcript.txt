Riles? Have you heard anything about the expansion loan? Yeah, Mr. Green actually just called and said he would let me know in a few days. I'm so excited about what I could possibly do with additional space. You deserve it. We deserve it. We are a team. Yeah. Well, hello, you. Hey. Is it lunch already? Yeah. Looks like you need a bit of help over there. Yeah, I actually might need two more tables set up. Chess night is growing. Oh, that's amazing, babe. Things are really taking off then? Yeah, it's really helping the kids' confidence. And the parents really love it, too, so it's a win-win. That is so true. It did help me, too, back in the day. You know how to play chess? Is that a question? Yes. Do you know how to play chess? OK, challenge accepted. Bring it on then. Let's go grab this lunch, and let's come back and settle this. OK. All right, then. Here we go. Do I know how to play chess. Are you kidding me? Here we go. Right. What do we have? Got some fruits. It's you. Some chocolates. All right. And tuna on rye. You're amazing. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, you're welcome. I forgot your book. Sorry. It finally came, and I forgot it. No, no, no, it's OK. I'll come in, and I'll pay for it like everybody else does. I don't want any special favors just 'cause I'm dating the boss. Well, I think dating the boss is exactly when you get special treatment. Oh, you really know how to get to my heart. This is good, baby. The perks of love. Yes, and there are many. So how was your morning? Better than yesterday. Yeah? Still recovering. Yeah, those rejection emails are the worst. They're horrible. Can't stand them. Yeah, but you know, you're really special. It's a hard industry to break into, and you just keep cracking at it. So is the owner of one of the few Black-owned independent bookstores in LA I'll take it. Thank you. You're so cute when you blush. I'm not blushing. You're not? No. Sorry. It's my mother Do not finish the dessert, Stevenson. I can't promise you that. Hello, mother. Is everything OK? You will definitely see me. I am not missing it for the world. Hello? Hi, yes. This is Riley Stevenson. Hi, Mr. Green. And remember, I am bringing a girlfriend over. Yeah, have you heard anything about the expansion loan yet? Her name is Riley. Oh. Oh. OK, I see. No, I understand. OK. Thank you. OK, ma, I love you. Bye. I'll see you. Bye. Everything OK? Yeah. Yeah, I'm just ready to get into this chocolate. Right. Try one. Mmm. Oh, yeah. Mmm. So listen, you're coming with me to South Africa, right? I don't know, Mandla. That was my mother. She was checking in to see if I'm still coming home for the anniversary celebration. I would love for you to come with me. I don't know if I can just up and go to South Africa right now. But you can. All you have to do is say yes. That's how I imagined it to be. So you would manage the US and Canada and, of course, recommend some UK-based sub-agents to handle all the other territories. Great We'll get onto it right away. All right, so we got a deal? We got a deal. Cheers. Later. Sounded like good news, sir. Great news, man. You just need to forward them the first few chapters of my book, and if there's interest, I may have secured us some distribution. Wow. Yep. On that celebratory note, all the plans are made for your trip home. I leave tonight to get everything ready for your arrival. Thank you, Sipho. I'll see you later. OK. We are going to read this book called "Tell Me the Day Backwards." Oh, I remember that game, Mama Bear said as she tucked him in. You start. I was chased by bees, and they were stinging me. I couldn't run fast enough to get away from them. Yes, that's right, said Mama Bear. Before that, I discovered an old, rotten tree stump with a dusty old beehive hidden inside it, and that's when you should have come and found me, Mama Bear reminded Timmy. He should have went and got his mom, right? Oh, this room is so cluttered. We're even outgrowing the space back here. Hey. You gonna tell me what's really bothering you? They denied the loan. Hi, Alex. Please don't tell me someone bought the building. No, we're talking to another lender. Next week? OK, I'll keep you posted. No, we're not gonna give up. OK. Thanks. Hey. It'll be all right. Just have to find a way to bounce back and just keep on going after your dream. I guess you're right. Mandla was just talking about this at lunch. Not gonna give up. We're gonna have that coffee shop. Yes, we are. What do they say? Fourth time's the charm? Third. Third. Or fourth, fifth, sixth? It doesn't matter. It's going to happen. Hey, Mandla. - You good? - Yeah, I'm good. And you? Yeah. Hello. Hey, babe. What are you doing here? You forgot your lunch bag in my car. Because she can't be without it tonight, huh, Mandla? And I wanted to show you something. I don't know if she told you, Sonya, but Riley here is coming home with me. I didn't say yes. Yeah, she didn't say yes just yet, but I'm sure Sonya won't mind letting you go for a week. Right, Sonya? Of course not. First-class. Yeah, Sipho used his points. Personally, I think that you should take a break from the store. Plus, who turns down first-class tickets to South Africa? There we go. Boom. Settled. I don't know, guys. Come on. No, look at this place. We have so much to do around here. And I just started the chess club with the kids, and they're gonna be so disappointed if I'm not here. I understand, babe. I get it, but I just can't wait for you to meet my family, especially now during their wedding anniversary. He's got a point. Can we talk about this over dinner? Girl, if you don't go to South Africa and meet this man's family, see if he has a brother, cousin, something. I'm trying to get married. There you go. Now you have an assignment. Oh, I forgot. I got your book. Yeah, OK. Great. Thank you. I just forgot my keys. Two seconds. OK. The keys are on my desk. Yeah. Oh yeah, I just got 'em. On my way. I got 'em. I cannot believe I am going to Africa. I know! You must miss it. How long has it been since you've been back? It's been 15 years? I miss it a lot. Aw, Ziggy. I'm gonna miss you. But Sonya's gonna take such good care of you. Yes. We're gonna have lots of fun and eat lots of meat. Yes you are. What about this one? Should I bring it? A definite no. You're flying first-class to South Africa to meet your boyfriend's family. You need to step up your game. I don't know if I can do this. What am I thinking. What? You don't think he's taking you all the way to South Africa to meet his family if he's not thinking of marrying? I don't know. We talked about it, but... Well, there you have it. Riles. OK. Look. I know you want to take Stevenson's Read to the next level. Expand by buying the coffee shop next door and reading to the kids, and it's gonna happen. You just have to trust the process and enjoy the journey. Everything will unfold the way it's supposed to. I know. You're right. It's just, I haven't heard from Bayside Lending. Just promise me, as soon as they call you, you will let me know. Of course. I promise. I've got your back. Have I told you how much I love you? No, but you can now. You're like my family. Like my sister. From college roommates to my biggest support system. Who would have thought? Right. OK. So. Really? I mean, no. This is so fancy. Mandla's so laid-back. I can't imagine his family doing anything this elaborate. Just because he's laid back, it doesn't mean his family is. What does your mom say? Better to have and not need? Than need and not have. There you go. You're going to South Africa! I'm going to South Africa! There. There they are. Hey. Get in here. Oh, you're always my little brother no matter how old you get. And you must be Riley, the lovely lady who stole my brother's heart. Yes. Thank you. And you must be Nandi. Yes. I've heard so much about you. It's so nice to meet you. Oh, get in here. Nice to meet you. You made it well? Sure. In all the stories that you've heard about me, I'm sure he told you about how I beat him in everything, including boxing. - Oh, OK? Is that so? OK. You do know I let you beat me all those years, right? Oh please, we all know you're a lover, not a fighter. Nice to see you, Ms. Riley. Yeah. I didn't know you were coming. Oh, I wouldn't miss a good party even if it is 10,000 miles away. Oh, yeah. I thought you said this was a small celebration? Yeah. It is. It is. Let's get going. - Shall we? Yeah. All right, ladies first. - I love your outfit. - Oh, I love yours. I love yours. You look so cute. Are you guys hungry? Yes, starving. How about... she's saying yeah, like yeah! Oh, yeah. Oh, definitely. What is that? You'll love it. I'll tell you all about it in the car. Thank you. You got the bags? Got it. OK. So shisanyama is a gathering place of up-and-coming urban professionals wanting to reconnect with their roots and the township residents looking for company and a place to eat and drink. You'll love it. Here we are. All right. Shall we? Yep. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Sipho. Yeah? - Name it. - You know it. Yes. Walls pop go. You know. We're gonna find a table, OK? OK, cool. Thank you. Oh, this looks amazing. This is so good. Home sweet home. That is chakalaka. So it's like baked beans with green beans, and carrots, and a whole lot of other stuff. It's hot, though. And this is pap. You guys call it what? Grits? - Grits. - Yeah. Yeah. Grits is softer, isn't it? Pap? This is why people come home. Do you like that? We eat in this manner. We all share. You take a little bit With our hands. Eat with your hands. So what do you think? It's really good. Yeah. Mandla tells me you own a bookstore? Yes, I do. That's fantastic. Is that how you guys met? Yes, but it's actually Sipho's doing. He's pretty much responsible for this. What you see in front of you. Yeah. So here's a story. He went to the bookstore to get me a book, but he forgot it. And of course, somebody had to get the book. Yes. So he came in, and he was so handsome. But he just made me laugh. He's so funny, and... And I've been smiling ever since. So that's how I knew. From that day, I could never get my mind off her. I couldn't stop thinking about her and yeah. I'm glad I went to get that book. Beautiful story. Yeah. This is a vibe. This is my jam. Oh, boy. Here we go again. I want to join that guy. This is not LA! Oh my gosh. I wanna join in. Yes. Come. I had so much fun. Listen. Um, I need to tell you something. Right now in the middle of a parking lot? Can it wait? OK, lovebirds. Let's go. Let's go. Guess it'll have to. Wow. Are you kidding me? Um, hey, listen. There's something I want to talk to you... No. We need to talk about this. Mandla, are you rich? Wait. You didn't answer my question. Um. Yeah, you know, there's some wealth in the family. It's complicated, baby. Let's get inside. OK? Oh, we're so happy to have you home, sir. It's so good to be home, brother. Wealthy enough for a butler. Barney, this is, um, Riley. Riley, an absolute pleasure. Nice to meet you. Oh, they didn't have to take my bags. I could have done that myself. Oh, but they do, ma'am. It's just Riley. Yeah. Shall we? Riley. Riley? Riley. Home sweet home. Hey, Riley? I know it's been a long day, so how's about I take you to your bedroom? So that we can save the introductions for tomorrow. - OK. - OK? Hold on. Excuse me. Do you mind if I say goodnight to the love of my life before you whisk her away? OK. Yeah. If I may? Be my guest. Thank you. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't know where to start. I'm sorry. I mean, this is definitely like nothing I've ever experienced before. But, um, I don't judge you for it. You don't? No. Just no more surprises, OK? Yes. No more surprises. I love you. I love you, too. I'm happy you're here. See you in the morning? All right. Good night, guys. All yours. Up you go. Watch your step. Goodnight. I'm sorry. I didn't know anyone was down here I'm Riley. I'm Mandla's... Ah, Mandla's friend from the States. Yes. Um, and you must be Mrs. Amitu. I'm sorry. My body's still on Pacific time, so I just came to get some water 'cause I was thirsty and snack. You have plenty of water in your suite. Oh, I... I didn't know. OK. Well, goodnight. Did you say mansion? Yes, because that's where I'm at. In the guest suite of a mansion. How. I don't know. Dude, I am still taking it all in. So much for a simple life in LA. So what's up? Did you hear from Bayside Lending? No, but I got a little call from your realtor. From Alex? Did someone buy the building? He said that an Angel Investor bought the building next door for your coffee shop. He said what? Someone bought the building. Yes, and it's yours! I know. He said he's gonna give me more information tomorrow, but it's done. You now own the building next door. I don't even know what to say. Who would do that, Sonya? We need to know. Please ask Alex to do whatever you can to find out, so that we can set up a repayment schedule with the investor. I did my research, and Angel Investors are just that. Angels. They don't want any of the recognition or their money back. OK, fine. I'll talk to Alex. This is just the wildest news I have heard in forever. I... OK, listen. You go enjoy yourself, and I'll get back to you as soon as I hear anything, OK? I definitely will. Come in. Ah, there she is. Good morning, my love. Oh, good morning. How do you always look so good in the morning? Oh, I'll take that. Listen, um, I came to tell you that breakfast will be served in a half hour. Oh. Served? Yes, served. OK. Well, I better go get showered for this fantasy that I'm living in. Something's different about you this morning. Really? How so? I don't know. You just have that extra sparkle in your eye, and I don't think I've ever seen that before. Must be the bed. I mean, I haven't slept this good in my whole life. You need to stop. We'll see you downstairs. Angel Investor? I could definitely get used to this. Morning. Oh, good morning. Sorry, I was just looking for breakfast. You're a little ways off, my dear. You must be Mandla's friend. Yes. And you must be his dad. Nice to meet you, Mr. Amitu. Nice meeting you, too. Please don't mind all of this. It's a hobby my wife and I share since we got married. I was actually just noticing what a great author he is. All of his books are about historical vintage planes except for one. My dad used to build model planes but nothing like this. Do you fly? Not as much as we used to. Oh, there you are. Hey, hey, son. Father. Look at you. You just keep getting younger. You guys are trying to make me look old. I see you've met Riley. You didn't tell me that your dad loved to build model planes. The man loves planes. Look at this place. I see nothing's changed. We better get to breakfast before Cook has our hide. Yes. Good to see you. I'll be right behind you. All right. Welcome, Riley. Thank you. You ready to meet the family? Mother. It's so great to see you. It's so great to see you, too, son, but you do look awfully tired. Is America stressing you out? Everything's fine, mom. In fact, couldn't be better. I want you to meet someone. This is Riley. We've met. Well... It appears your friend needed to quench her thirst in the middle of the night and thought it suitable to drink from the kitchen tap. It's OK, babe. I'll... I'll get Barney to show you where the fridge is. That's where you get all your water. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you again, Mrs. Amitu. This is a beautiful home you have here. I've heard so much about you. It's nice to finally get to meet you in-person. That's very interesting when we've recently heard about you. No. No, that's not it, mom. I did mention that I'm bringing Riley over for the celebration. Thank you. Well, happy wedding anniversary. 40 years? That's amazing. What's your secret? Well, it isn't much of a secret. The first and most important rule of any marriage, royal or ordinary, is the blessing of your parents, my dear. Riley. Son. Father. Morning, my love. I missed you this morning. Hello, hello. Look who it is. King Lou himself. You sit right next to Riley. Such a big boy now, Nandi. Thank you. So, Riley, did you sleep well last night? That bed is like nothing I've ever slept on before. I'm glad. We're so happy you're joining us for our anniversary. I'm so happy to be part of the celebration. Thank you so much for including me. My son tells me you have a bookstore? Yes, um, my parents opened it when I was five. Five? Well, my little champ over here's also five. Isn't that right, boy? Oh. Such a fun age, isn't it? After school, I would go and help my parents restock the shelves with the books, and then they gave me more responsibility. And now, I run it. And doing an incredible job at it if I might add. And, you know, it's beautiful. It's innovative. Oh, and she's actually expanding to opening up a coffee shop. That's right. We're opening up a coffee shop next door to increase foot traffic and grow the business. I want everyone to come in, and read a book, and enjoy their favorite cup of coffee. Oh, wow. That's really impressive, Riley. Right? I hear through the grapevine that a certain somebody around this table likes to read? You do, Luyanda? Well, maybe when you come to visit, you can participate in the kid's corner? Oh, absolutely. Yes. The older kids read to the younger kids, and we even opened up a chess club. Would you like to visit the kid's corner sometime, baby? Good morning, everyone. How's my favorite royal family doing this morning? Good morning, Queen Nobantu. King Chidike. And how's my daughter-in-law to be doing? Mom. Riley? Riley. Ayanda. Please, sit. Luyanda, why don't you go with Cook to the kitchen to get his treat? Riley! Riley. Riley. Hey. Hey. Please, let me explain. What? What is there to explain? You didn't tell me about your background. That woman just addressed your parents as King and Queen. Did she find out? Mm-hmm. And mother is just complicating things. Yeah, and your mom? She just... Sorry, the queen. She just called her daughter-in-law. This is what I want to talk to you about. Why didn't you ever mention that you were royalty? And that you had already found your princess? No. Your Highness. But Riley. I'm glad you're here, though. Mandla's gonna need you. You know, I tried to warn him, but he just doesn't listen. He's never been good at taking advice. Riley. Riley, please. Mandla. I should have just told her. We're just gonna have to let Riley digest all of this. OK? What is Ayanda doing here? And will the arrangements for the celebration? Everything's going perfectly fine. I knew you were the perfect choice. Mandla. It's so good to see you. You look great. Do you want to tell her what's going on? Can I speak to you in private? What's going on? It's Mandla. He's been lying this whole time. He's not only rich, he's royalty. He's what? Yeah, his mom and dad are King and Queen. Mandla's a prince? Yeah, he's a prince who's already found his princess. No. Can't be. Yeah. I met her today at breakfast. Now I'm just wondering what the heck am I doing here? I need to leave this place. Wait. There... There must be an explanation. I think you should talk to him first. Riles? It's not like Mandla to do something like this. Talk to him first before making any rash decisions. What is she doing here, mother? How dare you bring shame on the name of this family. Bring shame? It's a birthright, a privilege that many would love to be born into. And it's you conceal it from the world and tarnished it by bringing home some American girl who understands nothing about our customs. Are you really going to allow him to disgrace our family like this? My love, I see no disgrace in our son following his heart. We said we'd raise them differently, allow them the space for self-discovery. You've already given him far too much freedom. You know your mother well, son. But bear with her. It's a lot of change you're bringing to the family. Handle it with care. Riley? Riley, can we talk? Riley, please. I am sorry, OK? I didn't mean to hurt you. I feel like I don't even know you. What are you talking about? Of course you know me. You know me better than anyone in this house. Riley, please. Listen. Riley. Just stop. I was stupid. I should have said something. I'm... I'm sorry. Riley, just... Riley, stop. Riley, stop. Riley, where are you going? And what about that woman? Just stop. Listen. Stop. Stop for a second. Please. Can you just sit down, so I can explain myself to you? I'll tell you everything you want to know. Please. Ayanda's my ex. Your most recent ex? My only ex. When I was a teenager, we dated for a couple of years, and it didn't work. So I called it off. That's all it is. But that still doesn't explain why she's here now. She's working for my mother. That's all I know, Riley. That's it. Riley. Don't. Riley, please. I love only you. Now the third mouse, who was busy exploring the elephant's piped ear, said, oh, boy. What are we gonna do now? That's really silly, said the elephant. How dare you invite six mice into this house? Hey. I noticed that Luyanda seems introverted, but he's really not. If that makes sense. Yeah, that makes sense. Ever since his father died, he's just seemed to go into a deeper shell. I'm the only one here who talks to him. That's when he can get a word in. I'm so sorry for your loss. My parents died a few years ago. I can't even begin to imagine how a boy his age must feel. I'm so sorry, Riley. I would love to help if I can. Thank you. I'd absolutely love that. Come on. Oh, it's OK, everybody. Let's go back to the farm. We cannot find our friend. We'll come back tomorrow, and maybe Luyanda can help us. Right, boy? Hey, guys. Hey. And how are you today, Luyanda? My boy, can you please say hi to Riley? OK. Come on. Let's go get you a treat. Well done, boy. Thank you for reading with me. You're still a champ! Thank you, uncle. Hey, you. Hey. I got a date planned for you. Oh yeah? Oh really. Oh. Yes. What about this one? We've been doing this thing called life together. Baby, it's been a dream. I could really see me loving you forever, and this king needs a queen. And now it's time to show you, show you, show you a different part of me, a part you've never seen. I'd really like to show you, show you, show you a place that I call home. So honey, now you know. This is me. This is me. This is me. Oh yeah. Baby, I'ma show you. These are awesome. Have you found anything? Yeah, actually, can I get these two? Two cappuccinos. There you go, my angle. Thank you so much. Yeah. Pleasure's all mine. Thank you. Yeah. Feels so good to be back here. Really does. Barney and I used to come here as kids. Really? Yeah. Barney, your butler? Yeah. His father was the butler until he retired. He was the man that would bring us out here on weekends. It was really special. In fact, we were so mischievous, we caused so much trouble. We would disappear. We would run away from him and hide. Yeah, he was a good man. I needed to get away, and I think he understood that. This is so perfect. For you? No, silly, for Luyanda. I take it back. I take it back. The death of his dad has really impacted him. Yeah. I guess Nandi told you? Yeah. Yeah. How about this for your dad? Think he'll like it? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah? Oh, yeah. He's got a great collection. You know, growing up, my parents would build model planes. Later on, flying vintage planes became a hobby for them. My dad and I, we used to build model planes. Growing up, I was the only child, so I was like the son my dad never had and his little princess. I mean, you know not. OK. - Oh my gosh. - Yeah. Came out of your mouth. Salude, princess. I lost my father, too. So I know it hurts, right? So I have a sense of knowing how you must feel. But I want you to know that he loves you, and he's always right here with you. What's this? My heart. A child after my own heart. Ah, your Highness. Ah, no need for formalities, my dear. I got you something if that's OK. Absolutely. I hope you like it. Here you go. Oh my goodness, I've been looking for this book. Really? Yes. It's the last book he wrote before his fatal accident. Yeah. Well, I'm glad I was just able to contribute something to your incredible collection. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, Luyanda. Why don't you go get cleaned up for supper? Oh, look at him run. Look at him run. Look at him run. To the left! Well, I guess I... Now please, no rush. Luyanda, he's such a sweet boy. We have a lot in common. I overheard. I'm sorry about your parents. It's hard enough losing one, but both? It's unimaginable. Yeah. Until you're faced with it. But, um, my best friend and Mandla, they've been a godsend. So, I'm very grateful. I'm also sorry about the incident from the other morning. You didn't deserve that. Thank you. Are you sure you don't want me to reschedule the formalities, your majesty? It's your anniversary. You don't want to overdo it. You're right. There is a lot going on. Mother, you wanted to see me? Perhaps I should come back a bit later? No. Please excuse us, dear, and thank you. I couldn't have handled all those details without your methodical approach. Mandla. It's always so good to see you. Likewise. Have a seat, son. Everything OK? Everything's fine. The arrangements are moving along swiftly, and Ayanda's handling everything like the diligent princess she could be. That's great news. My only concern is you and this fantasy you created with your American friend. You mean Riley. Breaks my heart and it'll break yours, too, if you don't face the facts. And what are the facts, mother? Riley seems like a wonderful goal, Mandla... She's an amazing woman. You would love her, mother, if only you would... But you are a prince, and some day, you shall be king. And you need a strong woman by your side. One who understands our customs and traditions. One who loves and will serve our people. Ayanda has all these qualities and more. Ayanda is your choice, mother. Not mine. I made my choice. Her name is Riley Stevenson, and I love her. I'm sorry to disappoint you, mother, but this is hard for me, too. Your father's getting old. Now's the time for you to stay home and acquire as much knowledge as you can get while he's still with us. I'll speak to father. But as for Ayanda? We're history, mother. Hey, I was wondering if you could help me review the plans for the celebration? There's just so much to decide from. I'm starting to doubt my own judgment. Yes, I would love to. - Really? - Yes. Great. Thanks. And it's not much, it's just a few options that the event planner sent to Barney. So. Yes, I'd be happy to help. Great. When it was my parents' 13th wedding anniversary, I made sure it was the event of a lifetime. That lifetime didn't happen. Shortly after we celebrated, um, they got into a car accident. Riley, that's terrible. I'm so sorry. So I get why this day is so important to you. Maybe after the success of the party, your mom will start to like me a little bit. Well, on that note, here's what I had in mind. Yeah. Check it out. What do you think? Oh. It's really pretty. Yeah? Yeah. I like the muted and beige colors. OK. OK. It's very mature. But you know what? I think it would be nice to have some pop of color, make it a little bit more vibrant. OK. Yeah. All right. Definitely gonna keep that in mind. Thank you. You're welcome. Oh, and Luyanda really loved the book that you got for him, so thank you. Oh my gosh, that makes me so happy. He asked if you could read him a bedtime story, if that's OK with you? Yes. Really? Yeah. OK, great. I'm gonna give him a quick bath, and then you can do your thing. OK. Thank you. I'm eagerly anticipating the day your second book will grace these shelves. Publishing is a tricky business, father. One that not even royalty can make easier. Not that I've tried doing it. I know you haven't. Since you were a young boy, you refused using your royalty for personal advancement. This isn't something you learned from your mother and I, but a trait that I think will make you a better leader than any king in our life. You know, father, since returning home, I've only felt like I'm bringing shame to this family. By bringing an American girl home? Please. Son. You realize that one day should you become a father that there is no formula to raising a prince? You've always been curious about the world, tested the boundaries. We've encouraged it. In your childhood, your mother more than I, believe it or not. But son, we are aging now, and sometimes, we question the decisions we've made, both as parents and as king and queen. Never allow your mother and my fears to stop you from living a life of integrity. Integrity to who, father? To our people? Integrity to yourself. Now, are you going to help me finish building this plane? Where do I start again? You tell me. The beginning is what you would always say. In the beginning. Let's find the chickens. Where are the chickens? How many chickens are there? Two. Yes, there's two chickens. Where's the bear? Right there. Grizzly bear. A grizzly bear. What sound does the grizzly bear make? Rawr. Rawr. Oh my goodness. It sounds so scary. Oh my gosh, it's so big. It's gonna get me. It's gonna get me. Oh no. Where's the tiger? Oh my gosh. Well done. Thank you. That was good. That is one way to see sunny South Africa. I'm really enjoying South Africa. Oh, really? Yeah. Well, OK. You seem surprised I said that. Yeah. More like relieved that you said that. With all the drama, my mother, Ayanda in this house. I just didn't expect to hear you say that. So I'm a happy guy. So, babe. Tell me. Could you imagine yourself living here? I may have to return one day. I don't know, Mandla. I mean... You don't know? I would love to, but... But? Right now, my biggest dreams are tied to the bookstore, and it's not just any other bookstore. It's founded by my parents. So if I neglected it, it would feel like neglecting them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I get it. Well, you know what? I would never expect you to leave Stevenson's for me. But I, on the other hand, would gladly let all of this go for you. Really? Really. Yeah. I'd do it. I can't believe how much better you've actually gotten. Thank you very much. It's beautiful. I enjoy being there. I mean, I enjoyed being back here with you. Well, we're happy to have you back. Oh. Look who's here. That was good. That was really good. It was. Thank you so much. Have you told Riley that we waltz at these events? You waltz? I... I do. I know. I know. It sounds a bit... Prehistoric? Ancient? Yeah. I'm actually good at prehistoric and ancient. I am. He is. Yes, thank you. A second witness. Yeah, right? Absolutely. There we go. Oh my gosh. You sound like you don't believe me. No, I don't believe you. Let's make her believe. Yeah? I'll get the music. MANDLA AMITU: Cue the music. Yes. Madam? No, I... - Welcome. - I can't. No, I'm gonna sit this one out. No, you're not gonna sit this one out. I can't. You're gonna come. I'm ready. Postures up. Oh my gosh. Yeah. OK. OK. Left foot first. Follow my right foot, and we make a square. OK. - OK. Go. Big strides. One. Bring them together parallel and close the gap. OK. Oh, lord. We're gonna need a prayer. I told you, I don't know how to do it. OK. - OK. Just start. Ready to start again? - OK. OK. So your left foot. OK. And then go parallel with your right. And then you close the gap. That's one. That is step one. Like how they do it. Oh, right. Right. Exactly like that. Oh my gosh. OK. Well, hello. Hi. Um, let me get the music. No. You're gonna kill the music? Sipho, I thought the queen had scheduled a photo shoot? It's a little later. Good. I don't believe we've had the pleasure of meeting. I'm Ayanda, royal event director and a dear, dear friend of the queen. Hi, I'm Riley. I'm Mandla's girlfriend. Nice to meet you. And how do you like being in South Africa? It's great. I'm having a really great time... And how's my Manz been doing? I don't know when last I heard that name. I'm fine. I knew that would loosen you up. And Manz was Mandla's name when we were younger. Mine was Yaya given to me by Mandla. I know we've been apart for months now. I... Yes. Yaya. I mean, Ayanda. Yeah, but the hostility I sensed towards me must stop. I got your text from last night, and I just figured we... You text her? No. I... Riley. Point is, we've been in each other's lives longer than we've been apart. Look, I'm likely to be a part of this family longer. Whether as a friend or royalty. Monarchs are complicated, and choices in most matters have little to do with feelings alone. Mandla, can we please talk this through after the celebrations? I'm on your side, and together, we can make the best celebration for the king and the queen. You look beautiful, your majesty. Thank you, dear. Hello, my love. You look absolutely beautiful. Listen, I'm sorry about Ayanda. I want to talk to you about what she meant about that text, but I can't do it right now 'cause the family's waiting for us. Think you can manage a shoot, and we talk about it later? Yeah, that's fine. Thank you. All right, I'll see you. OK. Nice. Yeah. What about Riley? Oh, Riley can join us after the family portrait, sweetie. Can she please join us now? Well, if that's what Luyanda wants, then we shall give it to him. I don't think that's a good idea. Thank you, Ayanda, but this portrait is for Luyanda's bedroom. Isn't that right, big boy? - Yes. - Get in here. Riley, come. What? I know this hasn't been easy. Will that be all? That will be all. Just like old times. Thank you, family, for helping me complete this. Looks complicated. No, grandmother. This piece goes here. Yay, but this boy knows. Let's put it this way. Ah, there we go. Good job. Well done, Lu. That's my boy. Let the experts come in here. You're so good, my boy. Good job. OK, let's see. We need to add some paint to this. Lu, you gonna help me? Which one are we gonna go with? Yellow or blue? Yellow and blue. Yellow and blue? That's smart. What color does that make? The color green. You're such a smart boy. OK. We'll start with yellow, and then we'll mix them up. Sweetheart, why don't you show Riley what Grandpa taught you? Riley, do you know where this goes? No pressure, Riley. There we go. Yeah. You are pretty good at this, babe. You did it, father. We all did it. It's perfect. Just like old times, huh, mother? I missed you, son. You just missed Mandla. Oh, I was actually looking to go to the garden. Come. Join me. Would you like some tea? Oh, yes, please. Thank you. Thank you. My son is quite taken with you. Why is that? We love each other. I don't know. I'm just a normal girl. But he's not normal. He's a prince. He's been groomed as one. He told me about, um, when he was a kid, Barney's dad would take him and Barney down to the market just so he could run around and be normal. He reminded me of when we went to the Dodgers game. We took the subway, and Mandla was like a kid. I mean, he was so wide-eyed and trying not to let on that it was his first time. I didn't really get his reaction until now. He just wanted to be normal and fit in, even on the subway to a baseball game. That is true. Mandla's always wanted to fit in with the masses. May I ask you a question? Did you always want to be queen? Like every little girl's dream? Little girl dreams have no place when you're royal. You see, I met the king when I was only 16. But as young as I was, I understood that my role, first and foremost, was to serve the nation. As you and Mandla, you seem to have done everything back to front. It's an approach I have yet to wrap my head around, but if I'm being completely honest, I don't know if that can sustain the monarchy. Thank you so much for the opportunity to hear your perspective. At first, it felt personal, but now, I realize it's not. Your majesty, it is time for you to get ready for your fittings for tomorrow's celebration. Hi. Hey. This way, ladies. What... What's all this? What's going on? This is all for you for the party. For me? Mm-hmm. Are you kidding? OK, you're gonna have to try all of this one. I'm next. Go on. Have fun. Tell me what can this be. Wonderful and carefree. Happiness flowing everywhere. Excited to be here. Left the rays of the sun shine over me. Shine your light, shine your light, shine your light. No. No. I'm feeling free shining bright, shining bright, shining bright. Wow. Riley. This... This is the one. You look beautiful. You look beautiful. Thank you. You look handsome yourself. Or should I say princely? Shall we? Yes. It's time to introduce a special person to some special people. Wow. This is so beautiful. Oh my goodness, look at this. Look at you two. Looking nice. Ching ching. You look amazing. Thank you. So do you. Cheers. Cheers. Brother. Good. Mm-hmm. You look lovely. OK, Mandla, I think you need to say hello to your guests. Yes, yes. You're right. I do, and I'm seeing a few familiar faces. Let me introduce you to some people, OK? - OK, good luck. - All right. Thank you. Here we go. John. Good to see you, Mandla. I see you brought the family. Good. Good to see you. I think it's really going well. Yeah, right? Good evening. Hi, Ayanda. Now, don't you look lovely? So do you. Oh, I do. Thank you. Oh, you must meet this lady. Mrs. Tee, a very special lady. Mrs. Tee. Mandla. Oh. Is your brother introducing an American to the guests? He must be so confused. Please don't cause any problems for them tonight. But I'd never do that. Tonight's all about the king and his queen. Sure. Excuse me. Mandla here will follow in the footsteps of his parents. Oh, yes. That's very true, Mrs. Tee. Mrs. Tee over here was my carer when my mother was at the peak of her job and her role, and she couldn't attend to Nandi and I. She practically raised me. All the way to boarding school, she was right there. So she's a bit biased, right? Mrs. Tee, thank you so much for celebrating this day with my family. I really missed you. Me too, Mandla. Ladies and gentlemen, if I may? I'll admit, I'm tempted to hold your attention a little longer than necessary if it means we all appreciate my new skincare routine. I do exfoliate. But on this grand occasion of the 40th anniversary, it is my pleasure and honor to introduce to you your king and queen. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The queen and I welcome you all. It's our pleasure to have you as part of our 40th wedding anniversary. We are so blessed to have you all in our lives, and it is an honor to celebrate with you. We are also happy to have all of our family here. Our son, our daughter, and you, Riley. You are family. Now please, ladies and gentlemen, let's raise our glasses to my queen. Your queen. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Ladies and gentlemen, let's celebrate. Yeah. Oh, it's Sonya. You know what? I have to go take this. - Is everything OK? - Yeah, no. Everything is OK. I just need to go call her. Can you take that for me? All right. Just come back quickly, OK? 'Cause we've got the waltz soon. I'll be back. I'll see you. Why didn't they give a name? The only thing that Alex sent over was like a logo or something. How was that supposed to help? Yeah, exactly. I'm gonna text it to you now. Maybe you can figure out who it is? Yaya, listen. I know things are a bit strange between us, but I just wanted to say I really appreciate you connecting me to your brother about the bookstore. That was really nice of you. It's not a problem. We've always been there for each other. I mean it, Ayanda. I don't know anyone who would be willing to do what you did for someone they didn't know. Mandla, that's the thing you don't get. I'm not just anyone. What more will it take for you to see that I care for you and your family? Please don't go there. What about the plans we had? The dreams we held? Do those no longer matter? You will find someone. Someone who will love you and adore you, Ayanda. Someone you can build a future with. I'm just not that guy. 16 years, Mandla. Does that not count for anything? It does. It sure doesn't feel like it. I feel like the only one trapped in the past. I hold those memories, too. You do? Mandla, then let's create more of those memories. Riley. Riley! Excuse me. Riley. Riley. Riley. Riley. No, I don't want to see you! No! We've been together, what, three years? I feel like I don't even know you! I am done. Wait! No! I am done! OK, wait. I don't want to say anything. I just want to apologize. Riley, I am sorry. Riley, stop. I saw you kiss her. There was no kiss. She leaned into me and tried to kiss me, Riley, and nothing happened. All right? Riley, I just love you. You just... You have to start believing me when I say this, OK? And what about the building? I saw the papers on your desk. I put 2 and 2 together. And I figured out that you could have just come to me with your problems, but you didn't. Why didn't you come to me with this? Because I didn't want to have to tell you. I wanted to do it on my own. That's important to me. OK, OK, OK, I understand that. I understand. I'm sorry that I went behind your back about this. I shouldn't even have reached out to Ayanda. I should have thought better than that. But her brother is a successful property broker in LA. And I needed her to reach out to him, so he could buy this building for me because someone had put an offer on the building. And I needed that to be stopped before they closed the deal. That's why I did it, OK? Had I known that she would use that against me, and she would sabotage our relationship, then I wouldn't even have reached out to her. I wouldn't have, OK? That's the truth. I wish you could have just been honest from the very beginning. And that's my problem. I don't communicate these things. That's where I mess up. That's why I'm sorry. Well, ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for the waltz, a dance which I happen to be excellent at in my imagination. Riley. Baby, I'm sorry for raising my voice at you. No more secrets. No more. I promise. Tonight, we have the absolute honor of having our waltz opened for us by his majesty, King Chidike, and our queen, her majesty, Queen Nobantu. Thank you, Barney. Right on time. Listen, I want to talk to you about something. This week, you mentioned that I'm no longer the same man that you once knew. I just want to reassure you that I'm exactly the man that you fell in love with. Nothing's changed. Riley, I love the man that I am when I'm with you. I love everything that you've brought to this family. It's for these reasons and more that I want you to do me the honor. Riley Stevenson, will you marry me? Yes. Yes? Yes. - You said yes? - Yes. She said yes! I love you. I love you.
