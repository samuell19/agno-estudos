[♪] [♪] [GUNFIRE] I reckon it's over now. That Dillon gang's runnin' plumb wild again. I ought to be out there slinging lead at 'em. What chance would you have? The thing to do is ride to Fort Scott and fetch the soldiers. I reckon you're right, Nell, honey. I'm hittin' the trail. Forgot my guitar. Goodbye, Nell, honey. I hurt my knee. [♪] [NEIGHS] Hurry up with that saddle. How do you get this thing on? It goes this way, I told you. Wait a minute, what about that thing? That's the backstop, that's to keep you from sliding off backwards. Oh, no it ain't. That's the horn. The what? The horn. [HONKS] By golly, you're right. I'm going to toss the saddle on the nag. [GRUNTS] Sorry, sorry. You all right? [COUGHS] Hey, you idiots. Why don't you watch what you're doing? Yes, serge. Right, serge. Right-o. Now, get busy. Get some shoes on that horse on the double. Yes, sir, on the double. Yes, serge, on the double. Yes, on the double. MOE: Get shoes on that horse. They are the laziest bunch of guys I-- [CLEARS THROAT] What size, madam? We have some lovely ground-grippers-- Quiet! Stop the nonsense and get busy with that hammer. Go ahead. Oh! [CLANG] Take it easy, serge. We've got you. That did it. I'm gonna give you one solid year of KP. [SCREAMS] [CLANGING] [COUGHS] [CLANG] [GIGGLE] We'd better get out of here. Hey. This door is locked. We're trapped. Oh! What are you men doing here? Nothing, captain. Just inspecting the frame for flaws in the atnarussic. Oh, yes, of course. Flaws in the atnarussic? Oh, yes. Ooh. [GRUNTS] That's one of them. I'll teach you a thing or-- [GASPS] Captain Daley. Mullins, what is the meaning of this? Well, sir, I was-- Never mind. The colonel wants to see you at once. I'll attend to you later, Private Mullins. [WHIMPERS] Don't you worry about a thing, son. We'll take care of that Dillon gang. Thank you kindly, colonel. Keep forgettin' my guitar. I'm ridin', sir. I hurt my knee again. [BONK] Beg your pardon. Reporting as ordered, sir. At ease. Sergeant, I need three or four good men for a very important mission. Yes, sir. I want them to go into the Panhandle country disguised as desperadoes and hook up with that Dillon gang. Yes, sir. You understand, sergeant, this is a very dangerous mission. The Dillons are ruthless killers and these men that you select probably will never come back. I have just the men, sir. [♪] Uh-oh. Come back here. We're desperadoes, see? I don't feel very desperado. We've got to be tougher than they are. That's all. [BOTTLE CAP CLINKS] Oh, yeah? Oh! Oh! Oh! Shut up! Well, give me back my front teeth. Gimme a straight slug. Me too. I'll take a double. Make mine a triple. I'll take a milkshake. With sour milk. Psst. I'm back, Nell, honey. What took you so long? Oh, shucks. I fell off my horse and had to walk. What about the soldiers? That's them. NELL: Them? MAN: Here's mud in your eye. [COUGHING] [GASPING] Mu-- Mighty smooth. [WHISPERING] Maybe we ought to bump them off. No, no. Don't do that. Tough hombres, eh? Yeah. What about it? Handy with your shootin' irons, I reckon. Yeah, I reckon. Like this? [STUTTERS] That's nothing. Show 'em, Tex. Show 'em, Tex. You're Tex. Go on, show 'em. Stand clear, hombres, 'cause I'm rough and I'm tough. Yes, sir, I'm lightning with a shootin' iron. That's what I am. Lightnin'. Why... Greased lightnin', that's what I am. Why, I'll show you the badge, that's what I'll do. [GRUNTS] I'll have it in a minute. [GRUNTS] Oh, shucks, I forgot to load it. Put up your guns, boys, I'll handle this. You got anything to say, tenderfoot, before I gun you down? ( clicks ) Your gun is empty. Moe. Greased lightnin', that's what I am. Take it easy. Take it easy, Tex. Clear out, you polecats, before I get real rough with you. Go on. Get out. Oh, Elmer. Nell, honey. Ow. Look at this. Look at this. Get it off, will you? Hello, boys. What happened to your guns? We ran into three strangers, boss. Three strangers? Do you know who they are? No, I never seen 'em before. Lefty trailed 'em here from Fort Scott. They're spies. Spies? They'll have the troops down on us. Well, I'm leaving. Wait a minute. We're not leaving here. Not till we clean out the town. Anyway, how can those hombres report to Fort Scott, if they're dead? Yeah. If it's information you want, this is the place to get it. Dillon and his gang come here nearly every night. We'll be all ears. This is the last of it. The stage gets held up so regular we got to keep the gold from the mine in that safe. MOE: Wow! Does Dillon know about it? NELL: Oh, no. MOE: That's good. Look! ELMER: Oh, shucks, I missed. NELL: Now Dillon will know about the gold. That settles it, kid. You've got to ride. Tell the colonel we need the United States Cavalry. I reckon you're right, partner. I'm hittin' the trail. [CRASHING] Sounds like the trail hit him. And the little one said: "Who's been sleeping in my bed?" Wait till you taste this. You'll love it [♪] That'll-- That'll be two bits. See them? No, I don't. Okay, gents, what'll it be? What are you having, boys? Have you seen anything of three strangers around here? No, there ain't been no strangers around here, partner. Say, there was a couple of sheepherders in here about 7. And a few cowpokes about-- Oh, a little while after that. The only strangers that I know left town on the 4:00 stage. And come to think of it, there was three of 'em. Did you check that stage like I told you? BLACKJACK: Sure I did, boss. I wouldn't miss an important thing like that. There was only two old miners and some dude. Well, well... Spying, eh? No. Leaving. [CHATTERING] Ow! Where's the other one? He's gone, I guess. Then we'll have to work fast. Blackjack, go get the girl. I'm taking her with us. Right. Lefty, you open that safe. Sure. Take it easy. Now, I wonder where the other one went? [CHUCKLES] W-wait for me. [♪] Go on, get 'em. [YELPING] The boss is taking you along with him. Just in case he gets lonesome. [SCREAMS] Help! Help! Colonel, there's trouble at Coyote Creek. We need the cavalry. I'm sorry, son, but yesterday was payday and... Well, you know, boys will be boys. You mean no United States Cavalry? No United States Cavalry. Colonel, I'm ridin' alone. Oh, no. [CHUCKLES] [♪] [SCREAMS] Please! Oh! Oh! Please. I'm just a poor, weak woman. [GLASS BREAKS] [SIGHS] [♪] [CHUCKLES] Ah! Looks like we're going to need help. Go tell Blackjack to tie up the girl and come here. Right, boss. I've got him. Step back. [♪] See 'em? No, but we'll get 'em. [♪] [GASPS, SCREAMS] No, no, please! [♪] Oh, please! I'm just a poor, weak woman! [SIGHS] [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] [♪] Ow! Oh, Moe. I'm sorry. Wait a minute, you-- Go on, take him. [♪] I got the safe open. Good. Let's go. Right. LARRY AND MOE: Shemp, look out. Whoa! [♪] [GASPS] He's gone. Let's empty that safe and get out of here fast. You said you opened this. I did. It's locked. Never mind I know the combination. [♪] He's in there. That settles it. We'll blast. [MAN YELLS INDISTINCTLY] All right. I'll keep an eye on them. You go see what's holding up the boys. [♪] [♪] [GASPS] Oh. [SIGHS] [BUMP] [♪] A sparkler. Oh, no! Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh. Hey. [SHOUTING] Ow! Look out! What are you guys doin'? Playin' horsie-horsie? [GRUNTING] Come on untie us. Where's Nell? In there. Thanks, partner. Nell, honey. Oh! Oh! Oh, no. [CHATTERING] Oh, I see we got Dillon, too. Oh, isn't it wonderful, Elmer. Now we can get married. Now, wait a minute, Nell. Us Westerners ain't the marrying kind. We just go ridin' off into the sunset. [STRUMS] ♪ Oh, give me a home ♪ ♪ Where the buffalo-- ♪ Nell, honey. Elmer. Oh.... [SIGHS] [♪]
