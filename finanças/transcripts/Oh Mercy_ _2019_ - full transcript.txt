Here, all the crimes, derisory or tragic, are real. Victims and culprits existed. The action begins in the present day. Captain Daoud to dispatch. Daoud to dispatch. Dispatch for Captain Daoud. Vehicle on fire, near 100 rue du Grand Chemin. Call the FD and send 2 agents as backup. Calling FD. Vehicle en route. I'll need a forensic unit in an hour to examine the carcass. Copy that. What's new at the precinct? Nothing new. The usual. Merry Christmas, boss. Merry Christmas. I'm on my way. Over. Here! - How many are there? - Armed? Knife! Drop that knife! Calm down. Over there! This is my home! Back off! Pull out the blade! Go in the corner! It's him, not me! It's them! Can someone not drunk explain? Vincent groped me. My brother defended me. Then Vincent took a knife... Don't touch my brother! Bastard! Don't touch him! Open up! Please! Open up! Hold on, sir! They burned me! They scorched my face! They wanted to take my car. I'm burnt. Two of them? No, fou'. - Four? - Fou'. Oh, four. That's right. Arabs? Well... yeah. How were they dressed? - Those djerba things. - Djellaba? Yeah, djellaba. What color? White. And one of them had a turban. A turban. Yeah, a turban... So... Then, after they burned me here, I started my car... and it stalled. What did they burn you with? I told you... With a blowtorch... A kind of blowtorch, not a... military flamethrower! No, a little blowtorch... But he did a good job holding it. Here. Which hand? Which hand? Right, left, I can't remember. Right? Left? I can't remember. Oh yeah! His left hand. Yeah, because the right hand... he put it... on the window. He had a signet ring. A huge signet ring. A gold signet ring? Gold or silver, I forget. Really? So... these men... What did they say? Nothing! They just asked for my car. I said no. Then you escaped. Out the other door. And they didn't run after you? Listen... I'll explain. In my panic, I had a dust cloth, so I put it out because... it sizzles! And then I ran away. All they did was shout: "Allah Akbar". Just like that. "Allah Akbar", like that. Yep. Mr. Dos Santos, you're right to file a complaint, but let's take your deposition from the beginning. - Are you wounded? - No, I'm fine. Did you see anyone? How about the nose? Yeah... it was more squashed. Like a boxer's nose. See? There you go. Now the beard. The beard was pointy, I mean... all pointy, like this. A full beard? More like that. Now how about the hair? Well, he had a turban. I couldn't see it. Any distinguishing features? Scar, beauty mark... When you have a blowtorch pointed at your face, you have no time for details. What time did you get in? I didn't sleep. Great, the pain's gone. He's the burn victim? Maybe. Call a doctor? Of course... You'll team up with the new guy. Roubaix Police, hello? Hello, sir. Calm down. You were attacked? Are the assailants there? Louis? Armed robbery. Come on. A hold-up? In Three Bridges. Get your gun, a vest and a Taser. Coming. Guys, tell us when you get to the scene. Copy. Lieutenant... Call me Louis. Why the Taser? It's safer at Three Bridges. What's it like? Three Bridges... Full of life. When did it occur? 5, 10 minutes ago. Were they European? For me, personally, I'd say a European and an Algerian. How were they dressed? One was in a tracksuit with red and black Adidas... He aimed a gun at you? Yeah, an automatic. An automatic. A Beretta 92. The guy standing behind, had a pump-action shotgun. - You were afraid? - No, I wasn't! No man scares me. I was a shepherd. - A shepherd? - Yes. Now I'm a baker. Look... bread. Do you see jewelry here? I was robbed for 20 euros. Last year I got robbed 5 times. The scandals, the fights... When he used the blowtorch on you, your left hand... where was it? On my door, I think. This is important. Take note, Mr. Simon. "When he aimed the blowtorch at me, "my left hand was visible "on my door." Is that it? And he held the blowtorch with both hands, like this. With both hands? Yeah, I think so. That's odd, because... in your initial deposition, you said the individual with the blowtorch had it in his left hand. I said that? Look. You expressed yourself poorly or... Honestly, I can't remember. It's morning. I spent all night here. I'm tired. I need to sleep. No, we called Forensics for a reason. They're examining your car. We must go all the way. I must be dreaming. Nightmare! I'll tell you the truth. I think you're a good guy. Yeah. Conscientious. Yeah. Sometimes people come for insurance. Really? We've incarcerated for it. What's the article for fraud? Got a penal code? It's in the falsification section. Falsification... What do you think? What do I think? I just filed a complaint. Because if this is a false allegation, willful destruction plus attempted fraud, you'll go to court and to jail. 10 years. So, if all you did was drink too much, and got burnt while burning your car, all you get is a big fine. I now live in a city that's austere, violent. I already feel at home. I'd like to be useful. I wake up at 5:00. Exercise until 6:00, shower. 7:00, shift starts. 5:30 pm, shooting practice. Then I walk the streets. I'm getting my bearings. A canal crosses Roubaix in the north. City Hall is huge, a monstrosity. The middle-class homes are abandoned. The city is bankrupt. 75% of it is considered a "no-go area". 45% of the population lives in poverty. Roubaix is France's poorest commune. All good, Mrs. Gilouli? Fine thanks, Mr. Daoud. Goodnight. The air is moist, almost warm despite the winter. As if wrenched from a swamp waiting to reclaim it. Why did people come here? Poles, Italians, Portuguese, Algerians... Long ago, a thousand years, it was an industrial city, prosperous, a past they're unaware of. Pride, shame. All that's left is misery. A trace of having counted, of now being worthless. You can't come in. This is for you. Today you have an armed robbery rue de Lannoy, an attempted one nearby and a drug bust. De Kayser, for you. Thanks, chief. Next, a death threat against a welfare agent, extortion, breaking and entering and auto larceny. Anders... - For you. - Morning, Captain. Lieutenant Cotterel, arson rue des Vignes. Forensics was alerted. You'll go with Aubin. Any problems, ask Watteau. That will be all, thanks. Louis, can I see you for a sec? Were you on patrol last night? The armed robbery at the bakery and the knife fight. Please, no more night patrols when not on duty. I need my lieutenants for investigations. Understood. That's all. - Get to work. - Thanks, sir. So Cotterel, Daoud bawled you out? - What? - He does night patrols! Greedy bastard! What a bunch of finks! You with someone? Someone? A girl, a wife who cashes your paycheck. Not yet. Find yourself a girl. - You won't get by otherwise. - Says Daoud? Not his style. Daoud doesn't talk. He never talks. - That's why you laughed? - Yes! You obey. Good. This way, I think. Hello... December 26. 9:40. Rue des Vignes. Door forced open. Probably kicked. Here. Origin of the fire: the room behind the door. Second point of origin: below the stairs. Seems to be a case of arson. Hello, ma'am. Roubaix Police. Here for the fire next door. Did you see anything? I told your colleagues I was asleep. I had music on. And I drank, so I didn't see a thing. Except the explosion and the barking. I looked out the window and saw the explosions. You live alone here? With a friend. Marie? Marie, come out for a sec. Any idea what could have happened? All I saw was when the wires caught on fire. Hello. Yes. Roubaix Police. No trouble with that house? No fights or... No one lives in it? Nope. It was being renovated according to what the owner... she told us. There were fights. About minor stuff, dog poop by the door. - Your dog? - Our dogs. But not real fights. No issues with kids dealing here? Plenty of punks looking for trouble. Look over there. See that window? They broke the shutter. Why do they come here? You know them? Always the same ones? Can you ID them? I have a 6-year-old kid. So... even if I could, I wouldn't. No deposition, just informally. It won't be in the report. If your name never appears and you sign nothing, you can't ever be bothered. People aren't dumb. It'll get out it's me. They know I'm here. I have to protect my son. Any neighbor or witness could have talked. Honestly, even if I could ID them, I wouldn't. Come to the precinct? What for? Just to talk. No. Next one. Yeah... him. Him? - Sure? - Positive. I was struck by his eyes, not his hair. I remember his eyes. Any others? That's your cousin! Yeah, Guillaume. He stole your cell phone. Was he also near the fire? No, not my cousin. Him, I think... yeah. Him? Show us both. I saw them. Not lighting the fire, but hanging around that evening, then at night. I got scared and pulled the curtains. We didn't see who lit the fire. Thank you very much. We're police. Know where the Kovalkis are? Anyone home? The Kovalkis left. When did they leave? Late last night. I'm not waking you? No, no... I was sleeping. Roubaix Police. - I'm no cop. - I'm a lieutenant. - I'm looking for the Kovalkis. - Who? The Kovalki family. Your neighbors. Yeah, they left yesterday. Where did they move? They went, I think... behind rue du Coll√®ge. - When did she disappear? - November 17th. YOUNG GIRL MISSING What time of day? Friday in the afternoon. When I come back from work, in general, I find her at home. She makes coffee. We talk, spend a good afternoon. That day, she wasn't there. I didn't worry. I figured she'd come back. But later that night, around 9 or 10, still no news. That's when I started worrying. Next day, still no news. Your daughter's age? 17. - She has no cell phone? - No. First time? She ran away before. How many times? - At least 8 times. - No, 10. 8 or 9, but it's the first time that... it's too long. Before she came back after 2, 3 days. - And now, no news in... - 5 weeks. Since she disappeared. You're worried. Sure we are. She's been missing 5 weeks. There were no fights at home? No letter, no message? No letter, no fight. Know her friends, her acquaintances? She has few acquaintances. No friends. There's Fatia Belkacem. There. So who's Fatia? A friend of hers. She lives in Le Pile. Very pretty girl. Yes. I'll try to find her. To reassure you and see if she's well. But she's 17. Next year she'll be legal. She'll be free to move out. Yes. Sophie... Why doesn't she use your last name? How so? Your daughter... what's her last name? Duhamel. Duhamel, why? It's her mother's name. She kept her mom's name. You didn't acknowledge paternity? She's acknowledged now. You acknowledged paternity later on? Yes. Good evening. Gin and tonic. Sorry. I saw the hotel, thought I'd hang out. I don't know the city yet. I'll go. I won't bother you. Have a seat. We'll make an exception. You play the races? I like horses. You win often? I never gamble. May I look? Interested? I'd have to take a good look at the sheets, but if you can withstand losses, I can help you win. You're good at math. Numbers. No rules without them. They keep the world spinning. I couldn't say. But having your own horse, seeing him race... that must be something. I'll give you one. Okay... As kids, we called them "coffin nails". Where, in Roubaix? Any suspects for the arson? We're about to. I have two names. I don't know... You always know if they're guilty or innocent? Always. How can you tell? I don't know. I try to think like them. Were you a cop here? Yes. And then? 2 years training at Saint Cyr, at Mont d'Or. You have a family? No. Well, yes. Everyone has a family. They must be proud. Why? That you're captain. Impressive. My older brother and everyone went back to Algeria. - Whole family? - All of them. Really. Why? Wrong question. The right one is why did I stay. Where should I go? This place is my childhood. That way is Belgium. Hooker bars. That way is Tourcoing. Behind it, you can make out Lille. Behind those chimney tops is Epeule. And if you look closely... there's the school I learned French in, when I got here at the age of 7. Now it's violent, dirty, lots of drugs. Across from the park, my middle school. Hello, Mr. Kovalki. Roubaix Police. Come on in. Lieutenant... Hello, ma'am. - You moved? - Yes, is something wrong? We looked for you all over. I live at my brother's now. Can we talk somewhere quiet? Want us to go in another room? - The precinct. - Why would I go there? More practical. Put on some pants. It's awkward with the kids. You may not be involved, but you have lots to lose. Your kids are good reason to level with us. - Spit it out! - I will. The fire in the empty house rue des Vignes. You were involved. What's this crap? No crap. You were seen at the scene. Stop denying it. Think with your head, not your guts. It's like I said you did it. Me, set fires God-knows-where? You know where. We ID'd your accomplice too. Hello, ma'am. - What's it about? - Capt. Daoud. Is Fatia still here? - You know a girl who went missing. - Sophie. Sophie Duhamel. You were seen hanging out. What do you say to that? I told her dad I'd help get her back No news since. Where did you see her? At her uncle Alaouane's. - Alaouane Hami is her uncle? - Yeah. You know, I know him. How would I know? I'm no cop. - She goes to his place? - Sometimes. - Sleeps there? - No. So where? Belgium sometimes, but she vanished. I have no news. That's bothersome. How do I find her now? Dunno. Is Sophie into religion? - No! - How do you know? I said she sleeps in Belgium. I didn't say Syria! Who mentioned Syria? I'm joking! Don't get pissed off! I'm in no mood to joke. A boyfriend? No, she's the type to live day by day. Meaning she sleeps around? She's no whore! Having a boyfriend doesn't make you a whore. Know what I'm scared of? Do you? Of her hustling in Lille. - I know. - What do you know? Why must I ask to get answers? I know everything. What am I not saying? - That she could hustle. - Says you, not me. You said "I know". I go to school. I'm not stupid. Could it happen to her? No, 'cause it would ruin our friendship. So here we have 1, we have 2, 3 points of origin. So what? It can't be accidental. Never could a fire break open a door like this. - The facts... - Are facts. But of no concern to me. I worked till late. Kovalki works now. So you work now? Yeah. Paint-line operator. I temp. Got qualification? I'm careful by the furnace. You were working December 25th? - I don't buy it. - I worked the 25th. From noon to 9. By the time I got home, it must have been 10. Everyone was working? Almost everyone. Hello, ma'am. Roubaix Police. Where's Farid? No idea! He left this morning. No, it's urgent. We may have the wrong guy in custody. So don't play that game. Where can we find Farid? He never woke up this morning. He's asleep in his room. Let's go... thanks. I'm not waking him up. You like scaring my mom and waking me up? You're crabby when you wake up. Sit. Driving an ATV on highway, theft, possession, theft... meter tampering, coke, firearms, harassment, driving without a permit. Newbie? I didn't know the star. That's me. You'll learn. No biggie. - So? - And now a crime. - Crime? - Something different. What crime? Fingering me for a crime? Burning a house. The crime: arson. - What? - Rue des Vignes, 2 nights ago. - Rue des Vignes? - You weren't there? I swear I didn't burn the house! So you know one burned. Burn a house near mine? - He's crazy. - You weren't there? Dude, I was downtown, walking around, chilling. I heard about the fire, saw the smoke. I thought about my family... I ran. I run. Get there. Rumors! "Marco and Mohamed did it!" Even those two dirtballs say they burnt it down! How can it be? So I beat them up. Go see if I'm telling the truth. Marco and Mohamed who? Come on, Marco. Let's not spend all day. We know you lit the fire. You paraded it all around town. I didn't parade jackshit. I got nothing to do with this. I did nothing. Word. Instead of ratting me out, just man up. What? Dumb-ass dirtbag! You tell me to man up? You trumpet! I've been here all day! I'll break your nose, you bum. It's easy. I was in Lille, in court. For theft. - You can check. - We will. Mr. Alaouane Hami? Hello. I'm Captain Daoud. You know my brother Sa√Ød. Sa√Ød Daoud? I know him. Remember me? I'm the little one. Yakoub. Yes, I see you. Didn't Sa√Ød take the family back to the village? I came to see you about your niece. She ran away. I know. - To stay with you in Tourcoing? - Yes, in Tourcoing. This happens often? It has before. Your brother isn't easy! He is the way he is. That's the way he is, my brother. She slept at your place? She slept there two nights. Then some guy called and she left with. His name is... Eric. I haven't seen her in 3 weeks, not since she left. What does Eric look like? He's tall... blond... his hair... the skull a little shaved. Is he the sort to screw up? Addict? She just said he works in Belgium. I don't know what to do. Something's not right in my head. I can't sleep. Is it my fault? No. Not your fault. Nothing to do with you. She'd have left anyway. I could have tied her up. But I can't, I don't know how. Her father would have come for her. She'd have run away again. You'd have lost her trust. I have a picture of her. It's the last time I took one, when she came to my place. Can I keep it? Why are they all lying to me? Who's telling the truth? If it's not Marco and Mohamed, why would Farid have ratted? We got Arab and French. What did the neighbor see? Arab and French. So we have them both. What's your gripe? Yeah, no. Happy? - Evening. - Evening, Mr. Daoud. I know it's not visiting hours. No worries. It's for your nephew? We'll tell him but we can't force him. Your nephew won't see you. - Is he well otherwise? - Yes. The usual fights, but he's okay. Using the commissary? He gets what he needs. He saw the enforcement judge? He'll stay here. No reduced sentence. He's so angry. You're telling me. I'll come back. Maybe he'll have changed his mind. Father, the captain gave me my first mission and I keep failing. I remember when I was 13, I was... at a retreat before my communion near Grenoble. I spent the night alone on the stone floor of the church, in tears. I begged God not to call me. It horrified me. Now I am praying for him to give me faith. I dream of grace. I see each of my suspects, Farid, Kovalki, Marco, writhing around my desk, each lost and guilty at the same time. A pity, above all, is hid in the heart of love. Claude, hello. Thanks for coming. Shall we go? You can come along with us. You okay? Let's begin. Look carefully from left to right. If you recognize a face, say the number, Claude. No names. They'll recognize me. They can't see or hear. - My son! - They can't see or hear. - It's like they can. - They can't. You don't know. Even if you say. Just give me a number. Say "number 1" or "number 2"... Then you go home. I told you with the pictures. Number 1 for sure. That's impossible, Claude. - Why not? - He was at work. We've corroborated it. Study their faces. Maybe he has a brother. If you didn't see well, say so. I told you. We drank beer. It was night. We were scared. You drank a lot? What if I told you people say you lit the fire? You make me laugh. I don't know. Could you have... Why would we have? I can't say. Check. I had my son that day. You see? Ask Child Services. For the fire, 2 times 2 denunciations. 4 suspects. - All with alibis. - What kind? Solid, flimsy, depends. The women are scared. They won't cooperate. Dead end, chief. Which one wouldn't come for lineup? Farid Moktar. I know Farid. Let's go see his mom. Coming! Where's Farid? Captain wants him. He left this morning. Threatened me! He left? - Hello, ma'am. - Captain. What happened? He dumped on me! He wanted to hit me. Why? He said "Dirty slut"! "Dirty whore! I'll cut off your head! "Go on, if I lose my temper, I'll whack you!" I had to defend myself with a knife. I kicked him out. - I'd have stabbed him. - He hit you? You kidding? He got scared! Where can we find him? No idea. I don't want him here anymore. I don't give a fuck! Were you hit or not? I have kids. I have to defend myself. Help us find him. Down the street. He's there doing his bullshit. Go under Blanc-sceau Bridge. - Po-po! Po-po! - Move it! Farid, over here! Okay! Give me your hands. - Why run, Farid? - I'm allowed! When we stop you, you stop. A night at the precinct! I'll walk back. You vanish, smoke weed with pals, skip the lineup, run when I come, fight with your mom, blame Marco and Mohamed but Marco was in court. He's lying! He was in a courthouse! I corroborated it! Mohamed says he was working. It's 90% sure! I need 100%! Why frame Marco and Mohamed? Everyone says it's those rats! They even say so themselves! You ratted on Marco and Mohamed because it was you! I have no proof, but I saw you. You saw nothing! I see you, now I see you. Look at me! I'm here for 5 years. Sneeze in the next 5 years, I'll lock you up. Hello. You okay? Fine and you? - Is she here? - Yes, with her friend Eric. Good evening. Evening. - Who's he? - No idea. Got a car, sir? Yeah, I do. Can you wait there while I talk to Sophie? She won't talk without me. So you called the cops, you bastard! You betrayed me, fucking coward! You bow down to pigs, my father scares you... Quiet, miss! Let her talk. Come. Young man, let me talk. I'm not here for fun. - Legally, she's a runaway minor. - Runaway? And this is my case. My father went whining to you? He blew off my summons. - Why? - The case isn't closed. He never showed up. So you're a runaway. Young man wait outside. Or you'll have trouble. Sophie, either this goes well or I throw you in a wagon, end of story. Go on. Yeah, I'll go. I'll be waiting. I'm not Sophie Duhamel anymore. Really? What's your name? Soufia Hami. - Soufia Hami? - You heard me. Not angry with your dad? - Why run away? - I have my reasons. You won't say? No. If I hurt myself inside, I keep it to myself. We can't give you a hand? Everything's fine. You gained weight? Yeah, I did. I mean... you seem in good health. You were too thin before. - Still have eczema? - Less. Show me your neck. The patches here disappeared. - A quick picture? - Whatever. Whatever... Coquettish! No. I'll show your parents. Deal? Don't care. You care about nothing. I know Alaouane. Did he tell you? He'd go clubbing with my brother. Right? Right. Why you laughing? It's just funny. I was little, maybe 10. Your uncle was a prince. Remember getting bounced from clubs? I remember, I remember... We'd drive 60 miles to Ostend. And they'd say: "You don't go in". We'd stand out front like dogs. And there was a sign: "No dogs, no Arabs". True or false? True. It's true, unfortunately. We'd have a laugh out front, then try elsewhere. Blankenberge, Knokke... See your uncle? He has a past. He struggled. And you badmouth him. I know he struggled. I don't disrespect him often. I'm just tense. So look at him like a prince. Lower your eyes. I love you way much. What? I said I love you way much. I know you love me. I like you too. How old is he? Turned 2 last spring. He's intact, not excitable. He's an easy horse, never hot-tempered. What's his name? Balios. He's already won two races. Up-and-coming horse? I guess you could say that. Come see him race. Cover him. He must be cold. You'll decide after. Yes, I'll come. Daoud. Watteau here. We got a rape. Girl in the subway. The guy from Lille? Seems so, but here. Victim just arrived. It's for Benoit, but I want to talk to the girl first. Coming. Call Lille. We'll all meet tonight at the judge's after her deposition. - She saw a doctor? - Sure. Hello. I'm Yakoub Daoud. What's your name? Her name is Agathe Ponchel. - Who are you? - Her school nurse. Okay. Agathe, shall we call your parents? No, I don't want them to know. So you'll see Benoit. I don't know him. He's our best cop for rape. Other girls were attacked too. It's always difficult. When it happens, Benoit always find the culprit. And I punish him. Look at me. You were afraid? Yes, I was. Now we'll catch him. He won't hurt anyone again. Benoit? Daoud wants you on this case. She's 13. 13? Fuck, why me? No female cops for minors? Corinne will help, but Daoud wants an officer. - Get all CCTV footage. - Done. Can he have it? Mind if I borrow it? - Can you track it? - Sure thing. Simon? You have to track the kid's phone. - She's lying? - I don't think so. Okay, Agathe? Ready? Can we get back to it? You leave the elevator, head to the platform. Is that when you see him? What did he look like? Can you recognize him? It's important. Young or old? Black? White? Was there anyone else around? Give me some details. I need them. When did you see him? You were down here? He grabbed my hair. Then he began attacking. - Where was that? Here? - Higher. At what point did he pull you up? Here. He pulled down his pants. That's enough. Can you bring her back? Out of CCTV range. We'll have nothing. He knows the place. Same MO. - For all 5 rapes? - All 5. With variations. No cell phone. He's untraceable. He goes into a CCTV blind spot. Just a silhouette from the camera at the exit. Illegible. Same as always. And the same white scarf. - How did he rape her? - Fellatio. - Accent? - Bad French, she said. No mask? No mask. We're looking for an Arab, 18 to 25 years old, between 5'3" and 5'10". Blue jacket with a zipper. Speaks with an Arab accent. I've fucked up everything. I saw 4 kids so poor they ratted each other out. Had to apologize to Kovalki. Couldn't pin a thing on Farid. Call back the witnesses? That pretty girl? They were drunk. - They're too scared to help. - Louis? You're not graded for convictions, but for maintaining order. You're just a cop. So maintain order. Anything else, Mr. Daoud? No thanks. I'm going. - Can I clear this? - Sure. Fatigue has overtaken me these past days. Life has shrunk. I've knocked at hundreds of doors. They open onto women. Veiled, beaten or triumphant. I don't think the hotel delivers mail. Write to me directly at the precinct. It's all falling apart. I need your help. Your daughter is better. No more eczema. That's reassuring. She's not comfortable here. That triggers the eczema. She'll come back now? She wants to change her name at 18. She wants to lose Duhamel. She wants her name to be Hami. Soufia Hami. Really? Why? She feels North African and wants a North African name. I'm surprised, but okay. You're lucky, Mr. Hami. Want to see a picture? Look. I took one of her. - Cute, isn't she? - I don't know. You won't say yes? You knew she let her hair grow? She wanted it short before. Excuse me, sir. Where did she sleep when she left? Grand Rue halfway house. Now you understand. Better than the street. Ever see the girls there? Hurry. He goes to his cell soon. After you. He lost weight. He stopped working out. Does he hear from his family? Yes. He called Algeria this week. He was happy. He doesn't hang with Islamists? No, the Beards keep to themselves. Want to talk to him? Where are you taking me? Stop, Brahim. Forget it. Take me to my cell. Stay seated! I don't want to see him! Look at your uncle! Gently. Look your uncle in the eyes! You're dead for me! I don't talk to the dead! Out! Get the hell out of here! Get out! Get out! Let him go. Did you bust him? Never. Why does he hate you? I don't know... His parents. His parents' parents. I forget. They make quite a racket. Yeah. CENTRAL PRECINCT Roubaix Police, yes? Claude Dubruyne, 4 rue des Vignes. I came last week. We hear noise. We're holed up. We're scared... Calm down, ma'am. Where are you? 4 rue des Vignes. We hear noise. We holed ourselves up with the dogs. Stay where you are. A car is on the way. Mrs. Neveux? Lucette? Police! What are you doing? - Calling Mrs. Lucette. - Drop the bag! Drop it, I said! Hands up! Did you call the cops? No, I'm coming back from work. You go inside? Hands on the walls! All I did was call. She didn't answer. You break the door? I just got back. I live nearby. Give me your hand. I'll finish. Go upstairs. Against the wall. - Take it easy! - Be quiet. Don't resist. Ma'am, it's the police! Ma'am? Call a medic! Call now. TN to TS, requesting medical backup... When I got back from work, I saw the door was open. I could see it was broken into. Evening, chief. Is the coroner here? He's finishing examining her. Breaking and entering? Just there. Crowbar or something. Evening... Can I see her face? Cause of death? Strangulation marks. I'll confirm after autopsy. Murder? How old was she? 83. Her ID is in the living room. Let's go. May I come in? Have you found a crowbar, a pick or a wire-cutter? No, nothing. Where are the neighbors who called? Last house down. They burnt the house under renovation, for the tools. Who "they"? The two fire girls. Show me their house. Number 11. Go get them. They burned the house 5 days ago. What for? To remove their prints. Separate the two women. I want the mother for questioning... Claude. I'll speak to her. Put the other one in custody. To the interrogation room. No lawyers yet. I'll see her first. Here, Marie. See you in an hour. Why are you taking her in? It's you who called the police? Yeah, but why? I'll unlock you. It's more comfortable. Let's begin. Your name? Marie Carpentier. Marie Carpentier, you're being held in custody but you may remain silent. Why in custody? What did I do? Want a doctor to examine you? No, no doctor. Want to tell your family? I have no one, just Claude. Do you want a lawyer? No, I didn't do anything wrong! I want to go. How long... This'll take how long? Usually 24 hours. It can go up to 48. In custody to do what? Ma'am, you're just in custody. We'll talk, then you can go home. Sign this notice of rights, stating you don't want a lawyer. I don't want one because I'm innocent. This is ridiculous. Empty your pockets, please. This is bullshit. I'm treated like a criminal while it's us who let you know. We called you. We got attacked. Now look. When's Claude gonna come? She'll be questioned elsewhere. You'll see her afterwards. When's that? "To my Armand, love of my life. "I love you madly. "I think about you constantly. "Lucette, May 6, 1953." She already lived here. Same address. Handcuffs for questioning? To be near you. What happened? - You won't believe me. - Not with me. - You won't believe me. - You broke in. I didn't go in. She went in. You too. I didn't go in. She went alone? Why? She told me after. She went to get her wallet. - Rob her? - To pay me back. If ever someone saw you go inside too, my God, Claude... I didn't go in there. I swear on my son's life. Okay, you didn't go inside. When did she get back? But she told me when... when I was asleep. What time? I can't remember 10:30, 11. That's when you knew about Lucette's. I was sleeping. I take pills. I was asleep. I forget. - It was when she told me. - She woke you? She woke me and said: "I did that to Lucette." Did what to Lucette? She said: "I stayed downstairs. I couldn't find her wallet." Lucette is dead. I didn't know. She didn't tell me! I found out from the police. What will we find at your place? Crap. Cat food... Don't gamble with your life. It's the truth. It kills me. I know she'll get life. - She was hard on me. - You won't be with her. You have a child. Now I'll show you what she took. Well, I don't know why I'm here. You're in custody. Exactly. We're not involved so why are we in custody? Says you. So stop shouting at me. What bullshit. It's us who call the police and it's us taken into custody. Let's start over. All this started with the dogs? Because they insisted so much when they barked. And you find their insisting suspicious? Yeah. You heard them bark and ran upstairs. First we went and looked in the bathroom. You're gonna repeat everything we said in my statement? I won't answer anymore. You have all the statements. All right. For someone who's blameless... Exactly, totally blameless. According to you! Of course. Lucette and us are on great terms. "Were on great terms". Past tense, now. So why didn't you knock at her door yesterday to see how she was? You hadn't seen her and you were worried. I didn't think of knocking. You spent your afternoon in the courtyard. First, not the whole afternoon. We spent some time, not the whole afternoon. - I never said that. - So how long? No idea. Me neither! I wasn't there, Marie. What did you do yesterday afternoon? I'm sick of this... We went to get... Claude's son. Then we... I went to the hospital, then we went home. What happened to your arm? Not my arm, my hand. I banged the wall. Why did you bang it? I don't like saying it. I got pissed off at Welfare because... they were driving me crazy with the papers. Take out the dogs. She'll show us what her friend brought home. She stole this. This too. Maybe this was mine. - It's not yours? - No. - What's in the bottle? - I didn't check. Bleach. I'll see if there's more. This too. She used this to break in. Who'll take care of my son? - Where is he? - He comes tomorrow. If you're not here, a social worker will tend to him. Your son will be fine. Good. We'll take the pictures. Sit up well and look straight ahead. Very good. Now your left profile. You know... there. Turn. Look straight ahead. I'll measure you. Against the wall, legs together. Look straight ahead. How long will I stay here? Captain Daoud will be here soon. Come... Just relax. Flat down. Now the palm. There. Just your right arm, since you hurt the left one. I'll take your DNA. Look at me. Open wide. Open your mouth... Close it and salivate on the lollypop. More. Open. Now I'll do the sides. It's over. Remove your belt. I have no belt. No belt. You have a cord. Can you take it off? Pull it out. You emptied your pockets? - Yes. - Okay. Are you wearing a bra? - Yes. - So remove it too. I have to search you. Come on. Lift your arms. Ma'am... I hate this. It's fine. Is this your stuff? You have asthma? Come. You have to tell Claude. Don't worry. Take off your shoes. You can shut it. Find anything? Hematomas on the neck, superior vena cava syndrome. Asphyxiation by strangulation. Any DNA traces? I sampled under the nails, but no defense wounds. She didn't fight. The larynx? Hemorrhagic suffusions, but no fracture. She just choked. You were at the autopsy? How is the investigation going? It's underway. - The other girl stole from Lucette's. - Marie? What did she take? You don't want to know. What does she say? I sent her to her cell. You'll question Claude. You know her. I'll speak to Marie a little. I'll join you after. Come with me. I'll uncuff you. Lift your sleeve. You okay? Get some sleep? I didn't know how to. You're seeing Captain Daoud. Think carefully. He's not into lies. So don't make me ashamed. I didn't come for nothing. Don't talk crap. This way. Sit. May I have a cigarette, sir? Yes, you may. Next one depends on you. Are you lucid? Yeah. You know where I just was? I was with your friend. Claude. Talk now! Time to talk to him. Go on! Know why Claude spent several hours with me? Claude made some revelations - let's call them "revelations" - which incriminate you. As things stand, you're in trouble. Let me finish. I'll explain why afterwards. If you don't take it on yourself to defend yourself, if you keep lying... - Why are you talking about... - Wait. You know, we have technical means - fingerprints, DNA - to help us. And gloves don't stop you from leaving traces. Let me finish. I'm not done. I want you to stop lying. Do you understand what we now know? Do you? Look, I'm not taking notes. I promise. You're accusing me like I did a murder. No, stop! No one's accusing you of murder. Did I say that? Did I accuse you? - It's like you... - You know what we know? What's been proven true? You committed theft. You'll end up confessing to it. It's obvious. Too much incriminating evidence. But if you're already lying about the theft, we'll think you're implicated in Lucette's death. I did lots of dumb stuff but I'm no criminal. - I didn't do... - You're a thief. Yep. Good. Now have some water. Drink, he said. And think hard. Wait. He'll help you. Give that to me. Drink. Done? Now take a deep breath and let it out. Tell us the truth. You'll feel better after. Go ahead. I took the TV. There we go, dammit! You took an hour to finally tell us the truth! I have nothing to do with Lucette's death. I'm no criminal. Okay. And while you take the TV, what is Claude doing? - Snooping around. - Snooping? See her take things? No, I didn't see her take things. So you left with the TV. That's impossible! Not alone! It's too heavy with a bad arm. No way! He's right. - I know it's... - How did you do it? She was inside and she gave it to me. And then? Then what? Then I hid it. Where? - Across. - Across where? In the shower. I saw your place. Impossible. Then at Angelo's. Then? What did you do next? Then we just went home. It's the truth. It's the truth. - Where's the Captain? - With Marie. He'll come here after. Claude... Marie wasn't alone at Lucette's. I say you were with her. - I wasn't. - You just won't say so. I didn't say you killed her, just that you were there. You helped Marie with the stuff. She couldn't have done it alone. When Marie says: "Claude was there. I did something awful. I did it. "But I wasn't alone." I believe her. I told you everything. What I saw, what I know. - I can't confess to what I didn't do. - Confess? Being inside isn't confessing. Yes. If I say it, I confess I was there. Yes! You were there but you didn't kill her. But I wasn't inside. - Yes! - No, I wasn't. Claude, you're a pain! You piss me off. Do you hear what he's saying? Marie says you were there. And you stole! So wake up! She's not even listening. Do you understand? I was home, waiting for Marie. "Home waiting for Marie." Funny, she says otherwise. Cut the crap! Stop denying! So you go inside, the two of you. You look around downstairs. You help yourselves to stuff. And since you're a little drunk and excited by your success downstairs, you say let's look upstairs. Maybe. We thought we'd find more interesting stuff. Interesting? Money? Jewelry? Were you wasted? Wasted? Had you smoked? Yeah. - Hash? - Yeah. Now do you understand we know what happened? No. Honestly, no. You realize we're not here empty-handed? Claude told us stuff. She showed us things. She showed us things. So we have material proof that fucks you over! Can you leave us? Sure. So, Marie, did you do something dumb? Or did she? Or did both of you? Or, as Benoit says, was it both of you? We don't know that yet. And if it's you, you have to tell me. Tell me. Because Claude will end up telling us. But if she's the guilty one, you have to tell me. Because she'll never confess. What, that both of us stole? Yes, but for Lucette. We didn't do anything. Un-fucking-believable! She was 80 years old! It's not true! You can't backtrack! Red is red, not blue! I won't confess to a murder I didn't do. So who did it? Who? Claude? No. We didn't touch Lucette. Did something happen? How come your friend Claude says you killed her? Wake up, girl! You're in deep shit! Wake up, Marie. Enough! Let it out now! He said to talk! I never lose my temper. I'm very calm. Ask anyone. I hate losing my temper. It bothers me. So now we're all going to take it easy. Want a smoke? Have one. I don't get why she put it all on me. Maybe to defend herself? Marie, wake up! Speak, now. Take a deep breath. You're upstairs. What happens up there? First of all, she had the idea all by herself. She decided. Decided what? To go there and to kill. How did it play out? In the downstairs medicine cabinet, Lucette had... liquid Tercian. And... she said let's get her to drink it. And then... we were both there... strangling her. You both strangled her? Yes. Strangulation is done with hands. Were they your hands, her hands, or all four hands? No, our four hands. They were two of us. Want to rest up? You'll rest up, and you'll eat too. We'll bring you something. I'll come back later. Any witnesses? A neighbor. Saw Claude that day trying to break into Lucette's. What does Claude say? She denies it all. I should confess to what I didn't do? Why are you stuck on "confess to what I didn't do"? I'm not talking about killing, but about being inside! That's too much. No reason to be inside. But you tried breaking in earlier. Yeah but there's a difference. - She was alive. Big difference. - Not that! Difference is, you were seen and it pisses you off! It's why you didn't break in earlier? I'm not pissed off. Yes, I was seen. I was checking if Lucette... Checking what? What for? To see if she was okay. We hadn't... You don't care about Lucette! Stop! I do care... What happened after you were seen? I looked at her. - And kept doing what you were doing? - No. No, you were seen. Once seen, you stop worrying about Lucette? Stop! Claude. Marie spoke. The truth now. Tell us the same thing. We'll bring you two together. You'll agree on what happened. But stop denying. You'll be doing time. You'll get more because... you pretend you did nothing. Marie told us everything. She implicated herself in murder. She said "I committed murder. "And my friend was with me." That's Marie. She talks nonsense. Why? Because she's in love with you? That means nothing. Why accuse you if she loves you? I don't know. Because she's telling the truth. I have to go back. I promised Marie not to leave her alone. Think this stuff over. Marie? Wake up. Let's start over. Ready? Why do you strangle her? Who decides to? Claude wanted us to. She said so? Yeah. What did she say? She said we gotta kill her. She said that? "We gotta kill her." It was already planned that afternoon. What, killing her? Yeah. And you said "Yeah, okay"? And I said, I said yeah okay. Good, you're in less deep shit. I didn't want... I didn't want to drag her down. Because she's your girlfriend? Yes, that's true. You feel better. It's coming out. Something to drink? I'll get you some coffee. So, Lucette drinks the Tercian. And Claude... reminds you that you gotta kill her. Keep on explaining. So, okay, then... Lucette woke up. It was too late to stop. All right... We had to go through with it. We had no choice. She had her drink the Tercian. She got her down on her bed and said it's time and... and we both strangled her. How? Marie? How did you do it? I took her by the neck. and she, Claude, she put the pillow on top. So... you strangled her at the neck and Claude used a pillow. She climbed on top of her too. Climbed on top of her? How? On her knees. Her knees on her face? Yeah, to press down. How long did it last? A pretty long while. Maybe 10 minutes? A little longer. Want to see a lawyer? No, I want to sleep. I'm tired. We'll take you to your cell. Tomorrow when this is over, I'll find you a lawyer. You want me to lie to feel relieved? - We're explaining! - Coming clean is in your interest! I know you were there! Marie says you were! Your interest is to say "I was there. I did nothing. "I stole but I didn't touch her. "She did it!" That's credible. Keep quiet and you get 20 years. Talk and it's 5 or 6! You choose. This is so I say what you want. I don't want you in any deeper! I'm thinking about your son. He's 6. He'll end up alone, he won't understand a thing. Claude... Save yourself, Claude. Talk! Stop being stupid! Save yourself. Yes, I went inside. We already know you went in. You're telling us nothing new! What will the judge say? They'll put you away for good! Then I saw. Yes, I saw. What next? We know that already. What did you see? What did I do when I went inside? I looked in the boxes. I took a wallet. We know. What next? Then I searched the place. We went up to make sure she was asleep. When we got there, she woke up. And Marie killed her. We're getting there. May I have some water? My lips are dry. Jeez... Where are we going? Madeleine. You'll sleep there. What about Marie? In Roubaix. When will I be released? I don't know. Tomorrow we'll bring you two together. - Who did what... - I told you, sir. For tonight the interrogation is over. What about my son? I promised you. He'll be taken care of. The father has custody? He's in foster care. That's a good thing. Claude? Claude? Mr. Daoud? Will I go to prison? It'll be fine, Claude. It'll be easier than being in custody. It's scary here. Prison is more reassuring. You'll see people, you'll have a TV, a real bed. I ruined my life. I should never have met Marie. You're beautiful. You always were, right? Yes. At the age of 10, life was free. Parents on bended knee, pretty dresses. Admiring girlfriends. Boys too. I bet you were a young rebel. Queen of elementary school. Queen of middle school, boys swarming around you. Adventures. Then you turn around one day and life isn't free. Look, you're 30. A kid, you drink... and you live with a woman you can't love. You got it wrong. You had to pay. I also think life should be... enchanted. Like your childhood. But it isn't. Night, boss. I brought your car. You can drive. Where shall I drop you? If you don't mind, the other side of the park. I feel like walking a bit. All right. I'm not keeping you out? No, I wasn't tired anyway. I never saw a murder before. As a kid, I played in this park. Rain or shine. Kids keep on playing here. Nothing's changed. Now I come to watch them. It soothes me. How do you deal with misery? That's nothing. Sometimes we don't know why... it all lights up. Go to bed now. Lord, give me the strength to forgive. Good evening... - Did she eat? - Yes. Not sleeping? What time is it? Late. You're an insomniac? Yes. Are you scared? I'm having dark thoughts. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be long. You think I'm a monster? No. I knew girls like you at school. I know you. Being a kid was tough? Yeah it was. A little girl, tomboyish, finds herself ugly. Struggles in the back of the class. Always alone. Then one day you meet Claude. She's gorgeous. But harsh. You've spent your life suffering. I don't want you suffering anymore. Yeah. I'll read each of you the other's deposition. Listen well. I want a joint one after. Okay. I'll start with Claude's. "From the stairs, we saw Lucette sitting on her bed." No. She was standing. No. She was trying to get up. "She was trying to get up." Yes. "She looked at us, surprised. "We said we'd called the police "because someone tried breaking in. "Then Marie whispered to me "'Let's give her the Tercian.'" That wasn't my idea. It wasn't your idea? No, why are you doing this? It's a detail. A detail that implies I'm lying, and I'm not. I'm not lying either. "Marie held the glass "and made her drink it all." I did that? Two. There were two of us. I held her while you helped her drink. You should know. You were there. It wasn't me who made her drink it. Stop! She couldn't hold the glass. So you helped her. She drank it when we said: "It'll do you good. "You'll sleep. The police will come." I said that? No, I said that. Say who did what so it'll be clear. Claude? What were you doing? I sat next to her to embrace her. I held her. She couldn't sit up. Marie? What she's saying is true. So it's you, Marie, who helped Lucette drink it? Yes. "We got impatient. I went down and took a Pelforth. "I was very nervous." So you stayed alone upstairs. Yes, upstairs. Claude, you went down for a beer. I didn't finish it there. I brought it back up. "Then Marie totally lost it. "She said now that we started, we'll finish. "Marie took the pillow from under Lucette's head, "put it on her face "and got on all fours on Lucette's body, "while holding down the pillow." On all fours? On her body? At first you held the pillow. When she screamed, you got on all fours. Remember. Think first and answer correctly. I'd never do this to you. Do you realize... what you're saying? Is it me? Is it me? I didn't say that, but you realize how you say it? All fours on her body? You were on all fours on her. - I wasn't on all fours. - "All fours" doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter. - I wasn't on all fours! Marie... It doesn't matter. She's dead anyway. It's true I took the pillow and I... To put it on her face. Marie, you said you suffocated the lady. And you add: "Claude gave me a hand right away." That's not true. "'Claude pressed the pillow with both hands. "Then she grabbed Lucette's neck. "So I also put a hand on her neck." True. Can you show us how Claude leaned on Lucette's neck? I was pressing like this... And then Claude... lent me a hand. And then... we both took her. She lent you a hand. What did she do? She strangled her with me. How? Like this. Claude. Show me where you were. Go on, show us how you did it. I didn't touch her. I was opposite the bed. When I saw that, she started hitting. Look at this! And that! You say you didn't touch her. You did! Here's the proof! Say it! Strangled or suffocated, you touched her! She was about to die with Marie suffocating and strangling her, so I gave her a hand, it's true. But I didn't strangle her, no I didn't... What's the difference? The difference is, by helping her... I get in... You're in deep shit already! What's the difference? Putting four fingers on her neck doesn't change a thing! You were in the house. You went upstairs. By setting foot there, you're in deep shit so stop pussyfooting! Know why we're fighting? You're in deep enough. I'm fighting for the truth. Accomplices get the same sentence. They'll say you're a coward! It's not cowardice, but fear for my son. Fear of what? Never seeing him again. You won't be seeing your kid soon. The question is... Either you see him at his communion or at his wedding. That's the difference! So this is your house? Yeah. I'll remind you of the rule. You reenact everything that happened. Every gesture you can recall. I wasn't there with you, so I'll give no indications. Okay. We're ready for it. You play a role. Your own role. Shall we go? - First we turned on the light. - Show us. We turned it on here. Then I went to the kitchen since I know the house better. I turned on the light here. I said, Marie turn that one off. I looked to see if I could find anything. I searched around. And I went to the cabinet. I opened it. That's when Marie saw the Tercian. I mean, we saw it. Marie said, we have to put this aside. - Can I act it out? - Of course. So we put it here. I took the bottle of Tercian from the box. I took the pipette, filled it all the way up and then I... took the pipette and the glass with me. But... since we have to go into detail, while Marie was preparing the Tercian, I checked the oven for Lucette's wallet. Then I checked the breadbox. And... we went to look in her pantry. It's where we found the beer we took. Yeah, we took out the 6-pack. We opened one. Right? I'm not mistaken? That's right. We wanted to see if Lucette was asleep. So we went up through that door, Marie first. We turned on the light. When we got here, we saw Lucette. I'll show you where I was. There was a night table here. I sat down first. If I remember right, I sat here. I said, don't worry, we called the police... Then Marie called me. Where was she? Here. I went to her. She said, give her the Tercian so she'll sleep. Yeah, I said that. I said yes. Then Marie brings the glass. What was in the glass? Tercian. How much? The whole pipette. But I already did that downstairs. I helped her. I held Lucette. Marie sat here. Go on, sit. We said, Lucette, drink this. It'll do you good. Marie held the glass while I held Lucette who couldn't sit up alone. Marie, you helped her drink it? It's not what you said. Yeah, well, on the spot like this, it's sort of... coming back. So then I said, okay, Lucette, rest a little until the police come. I helped her lie back down on the mattress, I pulled up the sheet. Then I waited a bit. We kept waiting, impatient. My turn to talk now. May I? Go ahead. There were those two pillows. I got down like this. She was lying like this. I took the pillow... and I did this. And I grabbed her throat. Like that? It was an impulse? No, like I told you, it was premeditated. No, it wasn't. Remember that afternoon, everything we said. Did you say let's kill Lucette? It was planned, Claude. No. There's no use lying. We'll... make things worse. I'm not lying. Saying we planned it means the guillotine. - No guillotine. - No death penalty. Death is never premeditated. Why would Marie lie? We have no choice. We have to go all the way. Look. It's even more obvious. You're here. You say: "We tend to her, we're caring." So you're both considerate... and suddenly Marie is here, doing this. She does this. Marie didn't just lose it! It doesn't fit. Right? It doesn't fit. The pillow is there. Let it out, Claude. Yes. Marie. Can you start over? I took the throat and squeezed. That's when Marie called me. I called you. I said... Come give me a hand because... With my arm I couldn't squeeze hard enough. And I said, can you come? I stepped in... because Lucette tried turning around. I tried to hold her arm. Afterwards, based on what Marie says, maybe I did actually put my hand on her throat. This is how we did it. Would you say you had planned to come here and to do that? - Yes. - No. We planned to rob her while she slept, not kill her. We'd already decided that afternoon. To rob her. Why would she invent? I didn't say she invented. Maybe she thought it. Tell the truth, Claude. I'm risking 20 years. Marie... Fuck, please. If it wasn't true, I wouldn't have dug you in deeper. You know I don't want you in deeper. I don't want you in deeper. I never said you wanted me deeper. But we never said we'd kill her! We never said we'd kill her. Never. We premeditated it. We didn't premeditate it. We'll stop here. All right? You'll have time to discuss this with your lawyers. Lille called. They arrested the subway rapist. - Where? - In Wazemmes. That's a good thing. Good. Guard? - You have a gynecological history? - No... Children? - Which cell? - Number 2. Where will Claude sleep? Don't worry. In another cell. But now that we confessed, they won't separate us? Come on, Marie. I don't want to go. If they piss me off, I'm outta there. Soufia, just say hello and see how it goes. Promise you'll wait? So I'll go see their faces. It makes you laugh. You bet it does. Want to mount him before he runs? He can eat before running? Not too cold? No, I'm fine. Did you bet? Of course! Subtitles: Andrew Litvack Subtitling: HIVENTY
