Patrick. - Patrick. - Yes? 14 degrees this afternoon in Paris and Lille, 16 to 17 in Lyon, cloudy with rain showers, turning stormy in the Southwest and on the Mediterranean coast. Thank you. Patrick Cohen, hello. Hello, Audrey. Hello, everyone. Welcome to France Inter. It's Thursday. Good morning. It's 7 o'clock. The news with Angélique Bouin. Hello. Hello, Patrick. Hello, everyone. Another accident last night on the A10 motorway. 7 people, among them a child, died. More from the scene shortly. As economic uncertainty grows, we look at the latest unemployment figures. Everything you ever wanted to know about animals. London's Natural History Museum devotes an exhibition on animal sexuality, open to the over-16s only. From the bonobo to the tortoise, find out everything... Scenes of panic this morning in Tokyo, as buildings shook and thousands fled their homes in a violent earthquake in Japan. The archipelago is on maximum alert amid fears of a tsunami. We disapprove of events in Tunisia and elsewhere, in the certainty that such barbarity... Many Tunisians fear the Jasmine revolution is slipping away. There is some progress: no more Ministry of Information. Hello. I want to talk about everything. I want to talk about nothing. In the DSK affair, the case is in danger of collapsing... By way of explanation, the fires in Russia, the droughts in Argentina, the floods in Australia, China's economic growth. There's a dissolution of ideas when there are so many elements, objectives... The fight against financial capitalism... The fight against Bashar al-Assad... No more photos of tomatoes on tins of tomatoes, or halved oranges... 7 million French households use wood for heating to reduce their bills. According to the adage used to explain any surprise, "Truth is stranger than fiction." To get an idea, if we look at the last few months, there's been a feeling of dizziness, a mixture of relief and trepidation, an enthusiasm based on uncertainty dressed up as fact. Shall we start? Has it been remastered? - No, that's the edit. - Let's go. "Day 3, number 1." Hello. Sales of new homes are collapsing. According to promoters, they fell by 24% in the first quarter. - I put a comma to... - Wait. Stop. You don't put pauses in flashes unless you've lost your voice. It's only three-and-a-half seconds long. You don't do that. - Don't do that again. - OK. We don't put pauses in flashes. You start the flash and 3 seconds in, you put a pause. If you put one at the end, that's fine. So don't do that. I'd rather you make these mistakes now. You know what effect that has? I forgot what you said. The music is so intrusive, I forget what you just said. In Syria, shots were heard this morning north of Damascus, where a security operation is in progress. Tanks remain in place. The zone is a major bed of opposition to President Assad. That's what I was afraid of. "..where a security operation is in progress." What does that mean? And you put it in quotes. - Whom are you quoting? - A journalist. A journalist. OK. You can't hear quotes on the radio. It's a tricky thing to get right. You need to give more detail. When you give information in a flash, you can't ask the listener to imagine things. If you let them imagine stuff, they won't hear the rest. They won't hear the Yemen, because they're imagining Libya, which they just heard about. It's your flash. You have 3 minutes, not to be a star, but to provide essential information. It's your responsibility. You are your own editor. You're the king of the world. That's why we don't give flashes to beginners. It has to be perfect. The choice of stories, the order... If you lose us along the way, forget it. You may as well take a walk. OK? Even if you're badly paid. "I look at Bastien, Chloé..." Two seconds. Antoine is very slow. - No. - Yes, I am. We've got time. Tell him where we are. Page 46. There. OK. "I look at Bastien, Chloé, Mum, Nathan, Kaori, "and those faces, "mostly strangers, "gathered around my father's coffin. "The undertakers lower him into the tomb. "The sun is shining. "It's a lovely day." That's nice. Let's go again. I could link it better. Go on, then, if you want. It was nice. He's right about the start. "I look at Bastien, Chloé, Mum, "Nathan, Kaori, "and those faces, mostly strangers, "gathered around my father's coffin." That's better. "The undertakers lower him into the tomb. "The sun is shining. "It's a lovely day." There's a loud noise. Maybe use the start of that one? Jawohl. Any problem? Was the noise after? That's good for us. "At that moment I see a distant silhouette, "near a moonlit stream. "The silhouette reminds me of someone. "Surely it can't be him?" - Can we go again? - Yes. Just to soften the start, so it doesn't leak into the scene. "At that moment I see a distant silhouette, "near a moonlit stream. "The silhouette reminds me of someone. "Surely it can't be him?" - Again? - No, that sounded good. The end was better before. OK, we'll do one more, then. Benjamin was right. Benjamin heard it. I saw Benjamin heard it. - You see his ears moving? - Yes. Under his mop of hair. Well done. Ready, quiet, please. We're rolling. Do you get nervous, on stage? Every day. All the time. I'm nervous. I get so stressed. I don't know. I'm very happy. It's my dream. But I'm always nervous behind the curtain. My doctor said: "That's not good at your age." I said: "It's my dream. I don't care, even if I die "behind the curtain." Aunt Milouda saying to women everywhere: "It's not a death sentence." No schooling, an arranged marriage, 6 children, and a violent husband who sent you to France. So you're in France, you're alone with 100 francs in your pocket, and no papers. So what did you do? Work on the black to survive? "On arrival in France, I had nothing on me, "not even any money. "No friends, no family, no home, no papers. "I didn't speak French. "I felt lonely, and sometimes afraid. "I felt lonely, and sometimes afraid. "Small things enriched my life because I conquered my fear. "All of that adds colour to life. "I'm sorry, I can't tell you any more as it reminds me of my past. "Forgive me, my friends." That's the first slam by Aunt Milouda. It's one thing to write it, but slamming means being on stage, in front of an audience, finding the rhythm, the flow. Did that come naturally? You mark the punctuation, so it's very smooth. Hear how you speak? You don't break it up. But you do on the page. You go line by line. You put little dots to mark the lines. That means that you're breathing. You break the tension. You don't do that. I can't hear it. Your voice is nice and steady. You don't go too fast. Better than the first day. Now bring it to life. Tell your story. Also because it's quite long, what do you retain? There's violence in Yemen, thousands of people gathered this morning to march on government buildings to protest against repression. Yemen is very small. Only one city and three dunes. - We don't know where it is. - Didn't I say? You're right, I didn't. So you assume it's in the capital. Not necessarily. - Not necessarily? - I don't remember. If you don't tell me, how can I verify it? Look at the headlines. The listener won't do that. We're going to be a little perfectionist. It's good, but we can improve it. - Was there a noise? - No, it's outside. I think it was OK, but I want to check there was no noise. "Hearing the car arrive, "Mum came out. "She came towards us, saying nothing. "I took her in my arms and hugged her." No noise. Hello. It's Emmanuel Leclère. Good. You especially. OK. I just wanted to know... For now, stuck in Paris. There are no more flights, so... Is the President going to speak? When he invites the last partisans, is there a chance of an interview? Pardon? Yes. This afternoon. OK, fine. Absolutely. Give it to me. Yes. OK. And who is it? Nicole? It's Marie-Claude. Are you doing Martine Aubry? What time is the press briefing? Right, OK. Maybe we'll get her... Maybe for 6 or 7. OK? Will you keep me posted when we get back? OK. See you later. Olivier? Who won, the horse or the cyclist? Look, tell me if it's funny. Who won last time? I'll call you later. We'll see what we'll do tonight. It could be a nice report if it's good. OK, Olivier, thanks. See you later. "Millions of dead sardines", Marie-Claude. - Where? - In a California port. - Millions. - Why did they die? No-one knows. It's a mystery, a bit like the birds. - Incredible. Where did you see that? - In Le Monde. I see it. Incredible. "Mysterious. Off Los Angeles, "hundreds of anchovies..." - I've got sardines. - No. "Millions of anchovies "were floating at Redondo Beach, Tuesday." It's horrible, though. I've got sardines. "The presence of algae..." No. They're anchovies. It's odd. It's like the nags, the wild boar, we're not going to do... a special... on Vincennes zoo. We need to finish the bulletin. There's the French football strip. A little breathing space. And Justin Bieber. - Who's his audience? - Pre-adolescents. It's not France Inter's. What shall we take? One space left? - Yes. - What can we do on Justin Bieber? Talk about the phenomenon. That'll please Thierry, I think. We can do a sociologist or some kids. I'd prefer a kid. But a sociologist is very France Inter. - A left-wing sociologist. - Yes, exclusively. That's tautological. We can also have some kids talking. Do you know any right-wing sociologists? Hello, Jésus. Hi, Jésus. - Corinne. - Yes? - Is it too late to change? - Tell me. There's been an incident on the Marseille docks. They rushed the picket line. Use that instead of the France Télécom thing. We'll use that later. So Norbert, drop the France Télécom and put that instead. Suddenly... It was quiet... Breaking news for 4 o'clock with an item on the Marseille dock strike. The man found cut in two died from a bullet in the back. No. No more flights. Finished. Air France has suspended... Air France has shut down for 3 days. They're about to enter Abidjan, so it could turn nasty... It could turn nasty very soon. Yesterday's attack on two French people in the Indiéné district was the same. They had their windscreens smashed and got away with slight injuries, but... No, no civilians. They got scared and left. Consequently no-one's moving. This morning you could travel between zone 4 and the airport for the plane arriving this morning, which they should have taken. I've no idea. Probably. But... Since it kicked off in Koumassi, everything's shut down. Nothing's moving. Corinne, do you want the Richard Place story? I just saw I've lost the France Télécom launch. - That's a sign. - Shame not to use it. Where is he? In Ras Lanouf, where it's kicking off? Exactly. And he says... - Take that, then. - Obviously. The pictures are impressive. You're not taking Fillon at 7? - No, at 5. - Only at 5? There's no room after. There's a whole bunch of stuff... Never mind. Tomorrow morning is fine. We'll use it once, then again tomorrow. I'll put the trousers on now. - Are you sure? - Yes. It's going to rain. Right. OK. I won't contradict you. - It's damp. - You think? It's damp outside, damp inside. Oh, well... Off we go. There were cross winds, and now it's in our faces. Needless to say, these 4 men will find it very hard to stay ahead till the end of this stage, one of the longest on the Tour. Yesterday it was 226km, today it's 218km. There are people on both sides of the road before the finish in Châteauroux. Tomorrow it's the hilly stages. But today in Châteauroux, it's definitely a sprinter who'll come off best. Bernard Cantin and Pierre-Louis Castelli for France Info. France Bleu 107.1, number 1 for traffic information. It's midday. Here's the news with Denis Faroud and Laetitia Bernard. - Hello, Laetitia. - Hello, everyone. Christine Lagarde's bid to head the IMF, the Arab revolutions and the Israel-Palestine peace plan will be debated this evening at the G8 summit in Deauville. Has the G8 been effective in the past? What can we expect? Denis Faroud will put these questions to his first guest, the head of the Institute of International and Strategic Relations. Also, the recruitment of supply teachers is under debate. For the first time, the Paris Academy is holding a recruitment day in association with Job Centres to fill its empty posts. "It's the consequence of not replacing "half of all civil servants", say the trade unions. In the magazine, Denis Faroud talks to the singer Jane Birkin. It was on arrival at Charles de Gaulle, whilst passing through passport control, on the television screens that I saw, like everyone else, the first images of the tsunami. Images that were completely terrifying, even apocalyptic. That's when I realised... the extent and the scale of the damage. Yes. I won't use the word "fatalism". That word hasn't come to mind since we witnessed the tragedy. However... I'm thinking of a word. A Japanese word comes to mind, which is hard to translate, and that is "gaman". How do you translate that? I'd say it's... the ability to endure with dignity what is unbearable. And it's often in order to have... to keep the feeling of honour, and not to... The idea of not bothering others. There you are. I think there is a particular perception of relations between the individual and the community. We'll do it one more time. We'll do the whole thing, then we'll look at what we need to do again. - OK? - Is it "performed"? "Perform." With an "R". Pronounce the "R", the American way. "Perform." And say: "Gotta go." Don't say "I've got to go." - Ah, OK. "Gotta go." - That's better, yes. We'll do the whole thing again so we have a real... We're rolling. Right. We're rolling. "Good evening, Roman." "Michael Chang! What are you doing here?" "I wanted to forgive you." That was better before. Start again. It was better before. "Good evening, Roman." "Michael Chang!" It was better before. "I wanted to..." "Say I'm sorry" would have done. Say: "I'm sorry". Don't say "that". "I wanted to say I'm sorry." That's enough. I got it wrong when I read it. OK. "Good evening, Roman." Wait. Take your time and concentrate. We're rolling. "Good evening, Roman." "Michael Chang! What are you doing here?" "I wanted to..." - "To say I'm..." - Yes. "I wanted to say I'm sorry." OK. Don't say "that". "I wanted to say I'm sorry." It was fine before. He did it spontaneously. We've got that. Remember what we've got. "Good evening, Roman." He's loud. "What are you doing here?" "I wanted to say that I'm sorry." "What for?" I'll see if he remembered it. "I wanted to say..." - Not too loud. - Yes. OK. We'll do it step by step. Like with kids. I'll feed him the lines. When you're ready. Now the crucial question, from Éliane Hopt, who lives in Romanèche-Thorins in Saône-et-Loire. "Due to a housing shortage, "at the end of August last year, "in Le Havre in Normandy they built "100 lodgings for students. "What is unusual about them?" They're containers. We need more "ding-ding". Get closer to the mic, Étienne. Wait for the "ding-ding", so that the listeners can think. They may be less focused than you, in the kitchen or the car. It's important they have time to think. We've seen news stories on this. We've heard about it on the radio, including France Inter. What kind of lodgings are they? - They're containers. - Yes. Containers is right. They are 25 metre-square containers. Well done, Olivier and Étienne. A perfect round. You leave with 150 euros, or try for the 500 euros in the.... Jackpot! Jackpot! Jackpot! "Long thought prehistoric, "these dry-stone cabins are recent constructions "to provide shelter to seasonal farmers "in the 18th and 19th centuries, "especially in Provence. "What are they called?" "Long thought prehistoric, "these dry-stone cabins are recent constructions, "probably from the 18th and 19th centuries. "Seasonal farmers took shelter there. "What are they called?" I can see them. Olivier? Get on the mic. I'll get it. I know you know it, but it's not coming. Ten seconds. Quick. Make a guess. We're happy because with classical music, we've lasted 18 years, in the face of programmes on the big commercial stations, and despite that, we're still here. Hooray! People say: "Doesn't it get in the way?" I say: "Not at all. These discs are my material. "The spiritual material for everything that goes out "through the microphone and onto the airwaves." I know every disc. I can tell you... The one that we played 2 years ago, I know where it is. I won't play it for another 5 years, but it's there, if we need a rare piece that you can't find in the shops. I won't throw anything away. Some things will never get played, but it's our heritage. This is humanity's heritage. All these discs are my companions. It's a network of happiness, of joie de vivre, the human spirit, which is gnawed by adversity. Everyone has bills, traumas, etc., but then they are elevated by music, which makes us forget all that. For an hour, I forget all my troubles in front of the microphone. Even before that, I'm in my element here, I'm happy. If my mother were alive she'd say: "Tidy it up. "You can't live like this." On the contrary, it keeps me going psychologically. I'm so happy. There it is. I have a broadcast assistant, and a producer who edits the programme. One is there, one is there, and we've got on for years. When one of them is away, I feel diminished, weakened and sad, too. I can't be away, or there's no-one. We can get away sometimes. We do a pre-recorded show. Sometimes I conduct concerts, so we record it in advance. The listener has to be pretty smart... People say: "I was sure you were live." I say: "Bad luck, no." It's very hard to tell. There's a technique. But I'm not going to tell you what it is. When I work, I mix things up. I'll do it as if it was real. You'll see. "Why did Belgians invent the chip? "There was a chip revolution. "On Thursday, Belgium equalled the Iraqi world record "for the longest political crisis: 249 days. "A sad event which young Belgians "celebrated and gibed at with demonstrations: "the chip revolution. "Previously, actor Benoît Poelvoorde had asked Belgians "to stop shaving until the country... "Previously, actor Benoît Poelvoorde had asked Belgians "to stop shaving... "Previously, actor Benoît Poelvoorde had asked Belgian men "to stop shaving until the country had a government. "Without success. "A Belgian senator... "Without success. "A Belgian senator..." Shit. "Without success. "A Belgian senator asked women "to go on sex strike. Without success. "But the chip may succeed "where bearded men and unreceptive women failed. "For Belgians, chips are part of their heritage. "The chip is obtained from a potato "which is peeled, chopped..." "...peeled, chopped and plunged into oil." Now I'll edit it as if nothing went wrong. You'll see, it's magic. Shit. What a pain. I said there weren't any work noises. Libya: Mathevon in London, Laugénie on the ground. Japan: audio from a frightened Tokyo resident. The magistrates, with Franck Cognard at the demo, then audio of Mercier. - If Mercier is no good... - Yes. I wonder... Or we drop the doctors. - No. - Here we go. We haven't done them at all. It's from this morning. "We haven't done them..." On the 7.15, we talked about them. There was audio in the news this morning. We didn't have the figures. The conference was this morning. We had an audio that illustrated the problem of doctors being attacked. You can't say we haven't talked about it. We didn't have the figures. We didn't invent a subject. - I heard a doctor talking. - In what? On the 8 o'clock. They destroyed his surgery 3 times. - We didn't give the figures. - Oh, the figures... I just mean that if we want to name a subject that we've never talked about... Ivory Coast, we've never talked about that. - What? - Another body in the Deûle river. Oh, damn. Is it in pieces, or whole? - That's the third. - No, the fourth. - Who is it? - I don't know. There were three missing. Was there a fourth? They're always finding... In Life is a Long Quiet River, they went swimming in the Deûle. I lived in Lille, we love the Deûle. I thought there were 3 missing. They were found. So who is the fourth one found in the Deûle? It's Marie-Claude. Well, yes. Did you see the little girl poisoned by a kebab? Dead? There was no-one missing... That's what I thought. OK. We were talking about it, saying: "Who is this new body?" Right. Listen. You're very kind. Thanks in advance. Thanks. Right, so, that one wasn't missing. He wasn't missing, so no-one knows who he is. So for now, we don't care. I didn't think it was all that bad, because a coffin isn't that... Well, yes, I suppose it's heavy. Our burials were homemade. We shovelled the earth ourselves. The last one was like that. We dug a hole and shoved the urn in it. It was just us, no undertaker. - We're rolling. - We're rolling. So I don't know much about undertakers. Why not? We'll deaden it a bit. It's quite long. OK. What we'll do is, we'll have stamping around the gravel for before. People? Yes. Just a little stamping. - The three of us will do it. - Yes. The 3 of them... Yes, there are 3 of them. - In what month are there storms? - Several. Here in France, it starts in around April or May, and ends in October or November. But they're not the same storms. But they're not the same. Springtime storms are at the end of the day. They don't interest us, because we need dark. - I work... - At night? - At night. - I see. Some people work... I say "work", but it's a hobby. It's paradoxical, but there's no other expression. We storm chasers say we work. So in April and May, they're short, end-of-day storms. You don't see much. There isn't much photographable lightning. But in summer when it's hot, July and August, there are storms with lightning. That's what we like, nice lightning bolts. - You're protected by the roof? - Yes. A roof is essential. My equipment is protected, my body is protected from the lightning, from the rain, and I can work safely without taking any risks. - It's still open, though. - There are lightning conductors. - I see. - Well, yes. We're surrounded by lightning conductors. What do you do for a living? I'd rather not say. - Really? - No. - Is it a secret? - Off air. It's not secret, but I don't want to say on air. I'll cut it, but tell me anyway. - I'm a doctor. - Why didn't you want to say? I don't want to advertise. We'll just say: "Michel". I won't give your surname. Are you a GP, or a specialist? I won't tell you my speciality, because there aren't many. - Really? - No, no. We can't see your photos because you're not online. Yes, that's true. Can you give me a photo to put on the show's website? - It's possible, yes. - So people can see it. Your loveliest lightning bolt. You'll be spoilt for choice. Between real lightning bolts, intracloud or cloud-to-cloud lightning. You have a choice. One photo will be hard. I don't know, it's up to you. - Your loveliest lightning bolt. - Yes, yes. The show is called Un temps de Pauchon. Can you say: "That's all from Un temps de Pauchon, "see you tomorrow"? "That's all from Un temps de Pauchon, see you tomorrow." If it's the weekend, we say: "That's all from Un temps de Pauchon, see you on Monday." Can you repeat that? "That's all from Un temps de Pauchon, "see you on Monday." "That's all from Un temps de Pauchon. "See you on Monday." We're hearing the Belgian Tom Boonen has withdrawn. Yes. That's the unpleasant surprise of the start of this stage. Tom Boonen fell badly 48 hours ago in the Carhaix-Cap Fréhel stage. Tom Boonen has withdrawn. There are now 192 riders in this Tour de France, and in this stage, the 7th, there are 4 leaders: Lezaun Perez, Delage, Meersman and Talabardon. They're 5 minutes 50 ahead of the peloton. 4 men in the lead and 1 withdrawal, the Belgian Tom Boonen. Bernard Cantin and Pierre-Louis Castelli for France Inter. Thank you. Catch up with you later. All the best. Nice house. - Is that yours? - Yes. Onzain is just up there. - Do you know it? - No. You'll see the Loire, the château, it's fantastic. A beautiful château. - What château? - Chaumont-sur-Loire. But first you'll go through the vines of Touraine-Mesland. I'm the Mayor of Mesland. The Mayor of Mesland! I'm Deputy Mayor of Onzain. It's part of the same appellation. Right, come on. Come on, Granddad. - Do you want a drink? - No, no. "A drink", sure... We can't mess around. - Get him a glass of Chinon! - No, we've a job to do. - No. We've a job to do. - And a reputation. A glass of Chinon. Maybe passing through Onzain, kilometre 110. OK. Once again, please. The last part of this programme is a minute of solitude. I'll leave you alone and you do what you want. Don't leave me alone. Yes, otherwise it's not a minute of solitude. So I'll leave you, it's a moment of improvisation. Silence is not allowed, that's been done. I like to have that in my head. As I said, silence is not allowed. - Whatever you do... - I don't do silence! Solitude is bad enough, silence would be terrible. So no silence, we're agreed. I think that when you're alone, there are two ways of speaking alone. It's either a confession, or anger. Anger is what I prefer. I'll take this chance to... peel 3 or 4 spuds... which are here. Because I love spuds. The spud is very important for the vocabulary: "Hey, spud-head!" Or: "That's just small potatoes." Potatoes were very important at primary school. Everyone did potato prints. And the potato has saved more people than penicillin. Major famines disappeared with the arrival of the potato. We say "spuds". Only the French say "potato". It's annoying because they're called spuds everywhere else. For me, peeling a spud whilst being in some way on the radio, is a homage to someone I loved very much, Yann Paranthoën, who was a sound engineer at France Culture and with whom I worked. He was a total spud specialist, and he recorded his spuds growing. It made for absolutely wonderful programmes. Beep-beep! The nag won by a short head, but he said it was nice. - OK. He has enough to do an amusing clip, that the cyclist was nice and spoke well. The horse too. I'll ask for a short item of 1'15, and we'll see how it goes, but it should be fine. Claude, this is France Inter. Can you hear me? - Perfectly. - Good. I'm ready whenever you are. Let's go. 4... 3... 2... 1. "It's difficult to know "what's happening in Egypt, where "the situation remains volatile, though relatively calm. "On Tahrir Square, the situation is tense. "Hundreds clashed there today: "pro-democracy demonstrators, and an ill-defined crowd "who set fire to the remaining tents. "The army looked on as the violence..." Alain Veinstein, good evening. Du jour au lendemain, with Bénédicte Heim, whose book Nues is published by Les Contrebandiers. "He looked at her beside her image, "where she didn't know she was. "The mystery was there not inside her. "And that is what bothered her the most. "She awaited news of this strangeness." Bénédicte Heim, when you're not writing, you teach. - Yes. You teach French in a school. It's not an anecdote, because you have combined these experiences in a book you wrote with your pupils. The book is called Salle 113. It came out in 2008. You talk about a moment in your teaching career, when, in your own words, you were "touched by grace". Absolutely. I was lucky enough to be teaching a class who were exceptionally creative. There was an effervescence, a ferment of ideas in those kids. Something tenuous, fragile, but also extremely powerful, to the extent that we were transported to a higher place. It allowed me to show those kids the extent to which they had hidden resources within them. It's natural that all my novels are autobiographical. Even if I'm writing about someone strangling his grandmother, I put something of myself in it, though I've never strangled my grandmother! But I have an idea of how it would be done. Obviously there's autobiography whether I'm describing a positive character or a negative one. There may be autobiography even describing a woman, "Madame Bovary is me." That's not me, it's someone else. I got that. "Someone else", said Umberto Eco, "is me", talking about his creature. "Someone else said: 'Umberto Eco is me'"! Would you say: "Simone Simonini," the despicable hero of your novel, "is me?" I did my best to make him abominable. You succeeded, he's odious. Describe the moment when your patients who have had transplants, Laurent Lantieri, discovered their new faces. You describe it well with Jérôme and Pascal. Is it a special moment? It's always the same. It's not immediate. Nor is it the fantasy of taking off the bandages like in films. They have no bandages. They see themselves in a mirror. Do they decide when to look at the new image? We ask them if they're ready. They say no, yes, no, then at some point they say yes. We show them a mirror. They all do the same thing: they put their thumbs up. They can't say thank you. A tracheotomy cannula prevents them talking. I think they'd say: "That's great." - I'm scared. - Scared of what? - Being sucked in? - Yes. - By the system? - For example, yes. - What if you're number 1? - And other stuff. Yes, but I like being the underdog. You see? In the background. I don't want to be a star. Imagine you can no longer buy cigarettes yourself... It must be horrible having bodyguards. When you're in a bar surrounded by people, but you can't be free. It must be horrible to live like that. I learned something from a good friend whom I adore, he's a great guy, that's Michel Piccoli. - Who directed you. He still takes the bus and the metro. Incredible! I'm the same, because I'm addicted to human beings. When I see people, it inspires me. I find human beings more interesting than animals, because they talk and make mistakes, and that inspires me. I'd like to enter the brain of Umberto Eco when he works. What is il professore Umberto Eco like when preparing to write a novel? They are extraordinarily complex novels, with several plots intertwined. You put up various curtains. When we open one, another appears. How do you write? How did Victor Hugo speak? Lamartine? Even more, Villon or Rabelais? What did their voices sound like? They were smaller than us, they ate differently. I've given students exercises in sound. To take, for example, a satire by Boileau, Les Embarras de Paris. I asked them to record a poem by Boileau. "My God! Who rends the air with such lugubrious cries?" What is a lugubrious cry in Paris, at night, in the 17th century? We know the streets were paved with wood, and that the roads flowed with sewage. There were animals: ducks, rabbits, chickens, cows, etc. The houses were lower, so the echo of the sound against them was not like today. You have to think of that. We'd be very surprised if suddenly we could have, which is impossible, the sounds of the past. "Schüst" Schützt... spritzt... spritzt. I can easily understand it's a disastrous word for you. Spritzt. Can you say: spritzt? And... Spritzt. Ah! Classy! "Stamm dicht. "Woge nach Woge spritzt", and then "Höhle". Höh-le... Höh-le... Be careful! "Die tie..." "die tiefste, schützt." "Die tiefste, schützt." Schützt, spritzt, tiefste. In Germany, they say... the audience is there to Lache, Weinen, Staunen: to laugh, to cry and to admire... to be surprised. Obviously laughter is destructive, it destroys everything. Children, when they saw me performing, wanted to push me, to slap me, to hit me. My little niece saw me in some comedy films, and said: "You're so stupid, Uncle Jos!" She hit me, slapped me. And so she should. People tapped me on the shoulder as if I was their friend... You see... it destroys everything, it undoes all those ties, all those social codes, and you enter a space that is more chaotic, less respectful, for sure. - What is it? - Which one do I take? - The road safety one. - Bernard Petit? For now, it's the more interesting. OK. - The other one's for tomorrow. - Right. Otherwise... What does Sir want now? - And Sébastien Baer? - On his way, he's finishing it. OK. It's late, I'm shattered. He's finishing it, he hasn't forgotten you. So we drop Jouanno and the oil slick. Shall we do that tomorrow? That's not bad. It sounds like a landslide in the mountains. That's what it sounds like. Not bad. It's in the mountains. - You don't like it? - Yes, it's... it's a layer. - You want Hollywood? - No. We've got lots of sounds. We've got... Earthquakes are outside. No, they happen in houses. That's the monks one. It's lighter. It's not bad. And I've got others. I've got some high-frequency music that we could add that goes boom-boom, you'll see. - That's nice. - It's distorting. There! - It's good when it distorts. - No, it isn't. If you record an earthquake, doesn't it distort? - An earthquake makes no noise. - True. - The only noise is... - The house shaking. No, the glasses tinkle. - I've experienced one. - So have I. The advantage of being old! I was only little. I had two children. You do things with your kids. Great! We don't have much time! We've been serious, you're a comedy engineer. You know all the tricks of the trade. - Like a mechanic. - Absolutely. And you've got quite a nerve, you tell the audience you're going to make them laugh. That's quite a risk: "I'm going to make you laugh." And it works every time! How do you do it? How? There are rules. Luckily. Otherwise you'd have to invent comedy every night! There are rules. The same way a magician needs to say: "This girl will disappear", and she does. It's not exactly the same, but when I say "You will laugh", I'm preparing the moment, increasing the tension. The audience is involved through my body, and part of what I'm doing. I take this object, I'm going to throw it, you can see the trajectory. That's it. That doesn't work. That doesn't work on the radio. Crescendo. Ladies and gentlemen... Gérard? Where is Gérard? So for us, 10:30 tomorrow. 10:30. And, ladies and gentlemen, I won't need, I'm sure, a second rehearsal. If you are in agreement that I can work, if necessary, a bit longer than lunchtime. Yes? OK. Until 3:30pm, then? See you tomorrow. Hello, Omar? Good evening. It's Aude-Émilie from France Inter. You wanted to put a question to our guests? Can you repeat that for me? OK. Sihem Bensedrine, I'm not forgetting this listener's question, which is often asked: "What do you think of France's attitude?" Since you're joining us, live, from Tunis... You were a founder of Radio Kalima, and God knows that wasn't easy. Lots of questions on the part played by Twitter, the Internet, the media in general, but obviously the media which rely specifically on electronic and digital. Do you want to comment, Sihem Bensedrine? We'll also ask Sophie Bessis and Pierre Vermeren. Sophie Bessis was telling me, off air, something she heard in Tunis about the Internet. Do you really think that digital played a role, as we saw, even though it ended differently, with the first demonstrations in Iran, which we discussed here, played an important part? Absolutely. Facebook was the media for this revolution, even before Al Jazeera played an important part by informing people of what was happening, people were cut off from each other. That's why Ben Ali was stupid not to arouse the people and channel it, had he been intelligent enough. It became a popular revolution. But we didn't see it coming. Thank you, Sihem Bensedrine. You're back tomorrow morning on France Inter with Pascale Clark. Sophie Bessis, you were telling me, when you were in Tunis during the demonstrations, a week ago, a young person said: "The man who invented the Internet "deserves the Nobel peace prize." - No. "The founder of Facebook "deserves the Nobel peace prize." Not the Internet. A young man said it at the demonstration. It played a huge role. Sihem summed it up very well. I'd like to come back to 2 points. People keep saying: "23 years of dictatorship." It was 50 years. Yes, previously, it was no pleasure cruise. - Bourguiba's regime was nothing like Ben Ali's dictatorship, which was almost, let's say, crude, compared to... - It was more paternalistic. - ...Bourguiba's despotism. It was a dictatorship under Bourguiba. There will be hesitant beginnings. Reality will take hold, after the revolutionary euphoria. Should all the supporters of the former regime be removed, that's a good question. You're listening to France Inter, it's 8:04pm. Here is the shipping forecast.

"Feel, amidst the chaos of sounds, forms, movements, "colours, smells, and touch we experience "and which transform us. Regularities, emotions, "sense, meaning, memories, hopes, "desires, fears, plans. "A story to be written, "an exchange." "An alpine terrine is very easy to make. "Melt 250 grams of reblochon, having removed the rind, "and melt it with 10cl of cream." In the Paris half of the pitch, Monnet-Paquet taken by Giuly. He's been passed, he could give it to Gameiro, in the penalty area. It's hard to control the ball. Lovely pass from Bodmer... Jean-Claude, 25 seconds. Ready. "At the end of the Iliad, the city of Troy is destroyed. "Whilst Aeneas, Virgile would later say in the Aeneid, "fled from Troy, "crossed the sea and founded Rome, "Ulysses, Homer said in the Odyssey, "took 10 years to return to his native Ithaca, "and to his wife Penelope and son Telemachus "whom he had left 20 years before. The goddess Athena "transformed him on arrival into an unrecognisable old man. "Only his blind dog Argos and his nurse Euryclée "recognised him. "Ulysses asked the 108 suitors pressing Penelope "to choose one of them. Once she had finished weaving "a shroud for Laërtes, Ulysses's father, she said. "Each night she undid what she'd woven each day. "The suitors grew tired of waiting. "So she suggested an archery test. "With Ulysses's bow, which he used "to shoot a single arrow "through the 12 axe heads lined up in the palace. "None of the suitors could string Ulysses's bow. "Ulysses was there, unrecognisable. He picked up his bow." From 9 until midnight, Évelyne Adam's Compil on France Bleu. Good evening, everyone. I'm delighted to be with you again, as always. I hope you're on top form.
