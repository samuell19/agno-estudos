Every young girl drams of a prince charming. Someone who melts your heart with his looks, holds you tight, makes you write poems and sing songs, and makes you forget everything, every girl dreams of a true man of love. Everyone has such a prince charming but I don't. Although I act as if there's no life at all That warm feeling takes me up to the sky How could you run away from your troubles or resent it But you keep going on no matter what A glimmer of hope shined when I felt lost I thought I had no soul - Give that. - No! Let go! Please help! - Are you alright? - He got my purse! Help! Somebody! Madam? Are you alright? Thank you, thank you very much. Well... I'm in shock. Sorry. - I just can't speak. - It's fine, don't worry. Thanks for coming to my help. What would I have done without you? You are so kind. You're alright, it's all that matters. You look fine. Well... I can accompany you if you're headed this way. That would be great. Thank you. Let me check if they took something. Although I act as if there's no life at all That warm feeling takes me up to the sky How could you run away from your troubles or resent it But you keep going on no matter what A glimmer of hope shined when I felt lost I thought I had no soul but something set about love I feel like feeling head over heels by your side When I kiss you I fall for your sweet talk I feel like feeling head over heels by your side When I kiss you I fall for your sweet talk Will you marry me? Yes! Yes! So, how was last night? Amazing. Everything was great. Look at our rings. Everything happened too fast. You met one month ago. Why getting engaged? Girl, Kerem is the man I've been looking for years. You know, I'm very skeptical towards everyone in such matters. But he is like nobody I ever met before. He's so different. We are meant for each other. Oh. Kerem? Stay calm, Asli. My purse! Oh, Aunt Hacer! It's me, Asli. Calm down. Auntie, calm down. - My pension is gone. - Asli, I'll call the police. It's alright. We'll find it. - Help! - Don't worry. It's alright, auntie. Do something, honey! Please! Honey, what can I do? This is police business. They're going to kill him. Should we call the police? They are crazy. Stop it! The police is here. I know. It happened very fast but maybe it's better this way. He came to ask for my hand right after the proposal. My parents were shocked because it was very sudden... What happened? Honey, are you alright? - Give the rings. - Yes, but... Here we go. And scissors. I brought scissors. Put them on. Congratulations. Congratulations. Let me kiss your hand, dad. My beautiful girl. Mom, let me kiss your hand. May you be happy. What's his profession? Economic and financial advisor for big companies. Some kind of economy expert. - You'd love him. - What's up? - How's it going? - Fine. We're talking about Asli's movie-like love story. Love? What love? Is there any love left? What love? Any left? Of course. My boyfriend is so romantic and so kind, you'll love him when you meet him. Are there such guys left? Asli? Are you sure that this guy is nice and romantic? He's the most intellectual man I met. I didn't hear him talking foul even once. It's like he never heard anyone cursing. I think he hates the idea of hurting people. I love his naive attitude. You two would love him. There's my romantic. Let me just introduce you to my buddies, then we'll go. - Hi. - Canberk, Nazli. - Nice to meet you. - Me too. It's like I know you from somewhere... ...but can't make it out. - From the finance market maybe. Honey, Canberk is in foreign trade. Could be. Maybe we had an interaction at some point. Could be. - Shall we go? - Let's go, honey. We're going to dine alone. We'll miss you guys. - Canberk, right? - Yes, Canberk. Nice to meet you. - See you around. - Bye. Very interesting guy. You are so beautiful... I love you so much. I love you more. Are you looking at the girl at our table, you ass! Asli! Asli! - I feel so bad. - It's alright. Where's the police? What a day it was. Are you better now? It was a weird day. Drink something to calm down when you're home. Alright, honey. I'm better now, don't worry. That shot, that explosion. I can't believe it, it was a nightmare. It's the first time I've experienced, such a thing. I'm shocked. Praise be, you were very calm. - Fortunately there's police. - I'll always be by your side. Always. OK? There are such gangsters and always will be. Remember what I told you when we met? We have police in this country. We have to remain calm. - And ask for help. - Alright. I can't believe it. You're such a romantic, great guy. Where did you find roses in the middle of the night? I planted them in the trunk, just to make you smile. Forget about today. Get a good sleep. And dream about me. Alright? Do you think I have another choice? I love you so much. Don't you ever leave me. I feel so safe when I'm with you. Leaving you? Asli, I won't drink water without you. You crushed my flower. Let me get that. - Good night. - Good night. Crying is no solution You and I are inseparable Crying is no solution You and I are inseparable - Move it! Move! - Let me go! Now... ...why did we gather here? In this great Istanbul, right under my nose, when my girl was by my side... ...you snatch purses, abduct people, and shoot around. Are you guys sick? Huh? Come here. What were you doing on Baghdad Street? Did you go all the way there to snatch purses? There are plenty of rich people there. Give me that purse. What happened to your face? I hit a car while I was running away. God hit you, not a car. Now I'll hit you and you'll hit the ground. Now get the fuck out of here before I hit you. And now you guys. Who were you abducting there? We were bleeding some contractor. Why the fuck did you come across me? You! Who were you shooting at? In the finest restaurant of Baghdad Street! How come you know that place, you slum rats? Does that place belong to your dad, dude? - Sir. - Huh? They invited us over to talk about some illegal business. The woman who was with the guy made a move on Muhittin... ...and the guy was high.. He challenged us and cursed. So we had to shoot him. What if I had to shoot you? It's up to you, sir. Hello? My love. Fine. Sleep tight, baby. Good night. I love you more. More. No, you hang up first. Fine, bye. Bye bye. Now... look. I'll beat you each of you. Then I'll hand you over to the police. Just behave for a change. I declare Baghdad Street a liberated area. From now on... ...if you should commit a crime there... ...I'll gather up all of you and feed you to crocodiles. I'll cut off your ears. I'll eat your eyes, dude! Sevcan, turn him around. Sevcan? My mom was expecting a girl, thus a girl's name. Dude, this is Dolapdere. Even the police hesitates when they come here, yet you came to collect money. What should we do with you? They said someone owed Mr. Gazanfer money. I was a fool to come here. There is no debt, sir. I beg you, get me down. I'm going to have a brain haemorrhage, Mr. Haktan. I'm begging you. Hanging upside down brought you to your senses. That sissy Gazanfer opened a car park here in Taksim. Did he consult us? No. We were just protecting our property. So we went to Taksim and took it over. Yet you come and tell us what we owe 100 grand. You made me come here in the dead of night. My time is money. Now you owe us 250 grand. Deduct that sissy's 100 grand. Bring us the 150 and then you can go. It's that simple. Bro, Boss is here. Alright, I'm going. Please, get me down. Let him hang around till they bring the money. I can only make bank transfer at this hour. I'm begging you, get me down. Hey, handsome. Is that all you could snatch today? Oh poor madam. Why go out with so little money? These guys run for nothing. It's not even worth to end up in juvenile. Man. I'd suggest you give it back but how would you find that woman? Dude, what do I tell you? Don't snatch the purses of old women. Shame on you! Snatch the purse of women who get money the easy way. They get money the easy way, for fuck's sake. Alright? Get going. Work harder tomorrow. Go. Boss, we've missed you. One of your bastards was snatching purses in Taksim. But they robbed a girl who in turn stole my heart. I'm walking around like a ghost for a week now. We met thanks to our business. So... When you look at her for 30 seconds... ...you really get high, Haktan. It's incredible. I walk around in Istanbul like a ghost for a week now. I'm beyond myself. I'm lost. What's that? Are you checking the blood pressure of that? We are always high, Boss. Then play something nice. Something for everybody. Come on! Who's that girl, Boss? Wait. Tell them to be silent. Silent! I'll tell you about the girl. She is a quite girl, living in her own world. You know what's best, Sevo? There is no way she would know me. She has nothing to do with illegal affairs. That's her world. A different world. So I introduced myself as someone else. And it went on like that. She's such a kisser, Haktan. She gets me sky high. Then... ...she gives me a long look... And bang, I fall down. Then... Hold my hand. Squeeze my hand. She holds my hand... ...and I'm flying again. Then... ...she remains silent. And I fall face down. In that moment it's just luck if I stay... ...in they sky... ...or on the ground. Where's dad? In the warehouse. He's at slaughter. Slaughter? I love it. Let's go. What did you put in that? Oh my! I've grown tired of beating you up, yet you don't get tired of being beaten up! Racketeering in Beyoglu is exclusively my deal. You opened a nightclub without my permission. You bought a car park without paying respect to me. How will that work out? Sir, we came from Gungoren. That car park was cheap and we bought it. Oh really? Do you work for the municipality? - Oh God! - Brother Servet. Your guys thought I'm in the nightclub business but I've got nothing to do with nightclubs. I'm Zulkuf, I own a horse race bookie. I have a prick of a brother-in-law, Horse Ahmet. He got me into this. - So you're a bookie? - Yes, sir. - I like bookies. - Great. - They got me to lose a lot. - God damn them. That's right. I have a question for you. - Ask. - The right answer will save you. Which is the favorite animal of horses? Brother Servet, what kind of a question is that? As far as I know horses love horses... ...flies, cows... Wrong. Butterflies. I'll kill you as I murder you. Oh, Don Juan has arrived. Where have you been for a week? Dad, the usual. We're a bit busy. Are you the son of a rival mafia? Why don't I know about your business? I had some delicate business lately. Oh really? Every cop in Istanbul is after us. Smuggling, purse snatching, abduction, threats, blackmail, racketeering. I'd be in for life if they catch me but you're chasing chicks. Someone from the agency is here. Agency? What agency? Probably reporters and cops. - Casting agency, dad. - What casting? Let them wait, Haktan. I'll come right over. Excuse me, dad. Jeez. Did you pay these extras? You didn't give us any money. Dude. I usually don't pay but you did a good deed. You act very well, congratulations. There were some continuity issues. I noticed them. Mr. Kerem, you know about movies. Do you know how many times I act during one day? Here. I'll call you if I should have another role for you. Our agency is at your service, Mr. Kerem. Respect. They're shooting a movie inside. Get lost before I make you join it. How are the streets in Beyoglu? We're good in the streets. The runners are great. They work like Ispark. How about purse snatching? We have a problem there. There's no money in the purses, boss. Nobody has any money. The chief of Organized Crime department is obsessed with us. They could raid us any time. The usual cops don't dare enter Dolapdere but that maniac could gather 300-500 undercover cops and raid us with mobile units and ruin us. Let's prioritize check and debt collection. Abduct any guys you have to. It's time for me to step aside and retire. And you should put a stop to your affairs of the heart and take the lead. This business is nothing like dressing fancy and put on airs in rich neighborhoods. This is Dolapdere. You could get stabbed here. Do you know why we cut your hair this style? - Any idea? - No, Chief. From now on all the pimps in Beyoglu will have this haircut. It will be easier for the police to identify them. And these pimps will have a decent look. Take a load of these guys. If you tried to fix them up you'd need a construction permit. It's easier to renovate a house than fixing up these guys. Don't forget my favor. You're getting classy. Go on. Chief, we're gathering Intel on the purse snatching gang. What's with those assholes? We're on their tales. The surveillance goes on. Are they still on the job? We've been following these guys for a year. They are the worst gang in Istanbul. Purse snatching, robbery, abduction. Everyday something else. These guys are godless. That's right, Chief. But we can't touch their leaders. Make way. They meet in Dolapdere and use it as a base. They are like ghosts. It is their turf. But they work all over Istanbul. Good, continue the surveillance. - So I'm putting on airs, huh? - Kerem. Listen to Boss Servet, Istanbul is in a mess. Don't get into trouble with your affairs of the heart. Haktan. It's not about love. - Don't you get it? - We know you. Haktan. This is... ...blind love. Alright? Did you hear what he said? He said "blind love". Now we're screwed. Honey. This house is great... ...but are we going to live here? It's bit over the top. It's my dad's wedding gift. What can I do? - Didn't you like it? - No, it's beautiful. I love it but it seems a bit overkill. We'll be so happy here. Don't worry. Professor, I loved your speech at the auditorium today. Your students are so lucky - to have a professor like you. - Thank you. - You'll become professors one day. - God willing. The future expects so much of you. Sir, as long as you're with us we'll make it. God willing, all together. - Sir! - What was in the case? - Documents. - You got mugged. Are you alright, sir? Get them to turn on the volume. Turn on the volume! I'm thinking... ...should I quit arabesque music for some time? I mean... ...I should go over to classical music. - These are all classics. - How? Kibariye sang this first in '82. We still listen to it. Isn't that a classic? It's a classic. - Well... - It's a classic. Let's call it a day. See you next week. Thank you very much, madam. Take care, get your sleep. You too. - I'm so tired. - It was good. It was beautiful. So, how's it going? Is Kerem still madly in love? You're overrating this guy. Don't you get how serious this is for me? I was scared to death when they stole my purse. Kerem came and calmed me down. I don't understand how they could dare... ...doing such a thing in the middle of the day. I don't get that either. I'm mad and surprised. They are just little kids. I would have given them money. - Why steal my purse? - I know, dear. There are such gangs in Istanbul. Rich guys like me work and make money and they steal it. Those bastards play Robin Hood. Please don't curse. You've become so rude. Hang out with Kerem and learn how to be kind. You know what? Kerem is secretly a hillbilly. All men are secretly hillbillies. You know me. I've attended the French college, I was brought up well. How could you compare me to a guy you just met? Hillbilly? Hate them. They listen to arabesque songs in their cars at top volume. And they curse all the time. You hate them more than I do. That's right. Not my type. You don't listen. I didn't hear Kerem curse at all. We listen to classical music in the car. What's that? They play nice, right? Fuck no. Tchaikovsky. Tea? What kind of a tea is this? Get him some nice tea. Screw your brains. Alright. Listen. You'll listen to such music from now on. Improve yourselves. You can't listen to arabesque all the time. I want cultural improvement in the neighborhood. - You're right. - Improvement. Would be a nice change. Listen to the boss! Yes but you could never catch me. You can't run fast anyway. You run like a horse. Were you born on a race track? "Were you born on a race track?" You have to work a lot to be able to catch me. What's that case? - What's this music? - Answer the boss! We thought there would be money. There were only lecture notes. Lecture notes? The kind that teachers write, right? I'm not sure. I'll take a closer look. That looks familiar. That case looks familiar. I was recently at an exhibit in Paris. Alexander Abraham's exhibit. Those were some statues. They symmetry of those shoulders. The great definition of the muscles. The smoothness of marble... Yes, dear Necla. The world is way ahead of us in terms of art. Ours are no statues. You should have seen the exhibit in Prague. They were all masterpieces. The sculptures of Prague are famous too. Ours are tiny sculptures. So true. We play with mud here. Your guy is still behind bars? Yes, he loves to serve time. It's impossible to understand them. My guy served 10 years and then said he missed the prison. What's to miss? They just love it. They are more free in jail. Let them be there. It's more comfy like this. At least nobody is shooting in the house. Here, honey. What did we do to deserve these hillbillies? Never mind. It's just a case. What if they had abducted you? But no, Necla. I had important notes in that case. Do you know how many students I failed because of them? I have to make make-up exams now. Don't worry so much. My uncle could find that case in no time. Hope so. Look who's here. - What's up? - Fine. You? Fine. Brother. I'm soaked up. Let me kiss you. - How are you, sis? - Where have you been? Sister, I am really busy. I'm busy as a bee. Incredible things go on in Istanbul. I don't have time to laugh. Oh dear, do they upset my precious? Don't make me laugh. Look girl, you know me. - I get hoarse. - Fine. You haven't been around. They asked for your niece's hand in marriage. No way. Look. You should have been here and run a background check on him. - Maybe he's not compatible with us. - Mom, come on. You've seen yourself how kind and naive he was. This is Istanbul. You can never be fucking sure. Shame on you. Why do you curse? My Sultana, you never spoke like this. Must have heard it on TV. They just don't beep. What are you guys on? What? Are you high? Why do you talk so elitist? What are you obsessed on, brother? They are engaged now. Why didn't you check out first? Why not? I did. He's a nice lad. I checked him out well. He's a brilliant guy, a true gentleman. If you say so I should check his whole family. You don't have to. Don't bother. When you see him yourself you'll say "What a brilliant guy." Her intelligence matches her beauty. She's a true judge of character. Is that a joke? - Is the landlord here? - No. I'll let you know. - Merry working. - Thank you. - Do my eyes deceive me? - They really look alike. Are our in-laws actors? No way. They just look alike. Brother, to whom did you engage this girl? For God's sake! This is veal breast, right? The most delicious part. But do I enjoy it? Just ask me. I don't. Why? Because I'm fed up with you. You get me? You got to snatch my father-in-law's case? Dude, are you guys sick? If you were members of another gang I'd understand. You work for me but steal for me. What is it? Speak! - Boss, we don't know your father-in-law... - So? If we had known your girl's family we wouldn't have done it. Am I to gather around 250 members of the gang and introduce you to my lazy and her family? Hell no, boss. Look at me. There's something I've been doing for a long time... ...and I always... ...enjoyed doing it... ...but didn't do it for some time because of certain reasons... ...and you... ...forced me to it! Come here, Sevo. Come, come. Turn around and look. Now tell me. We are a gang of how many members? A gang of 250. I think there will be less soon. Bravo. You're a smart thief, Sevo. Listen. When it's your turn to die, that's it, right? If only they had not barked at the wrong tree. - If only. - If only. Fucking thief. The groom is a nice guy. - Enjoy. - Thank you, dear. Thank you.. The groom is a nice guy but... ...did you catch the thief who got my case? Brother, I'll handle it in a couple of days. We've been very busy. They're destroying the ecology of our world. We can't go out on the streets. They're destroying the ecology, sociology and typology. The araphormally and everything. Especially those gangs. There is such a gang. Purse snatching, pickpocketing, abducting girls, intimidation, loan sharking, they have it all. I've set my mind on it, I'll destroy them all. You know how obsessed I can get. I can get obsessed very bad. These are cruel guys, brother. They really are cruel. Sorry, brother. See, these guys are cruel. Your case is gone. Cruelty, purse snatching. What if those guys are actually these guys? Would you like that? I would. Who would not... It would make things easier. - It just occurred to me. - How? - Look. - Well thought. - He did. - Bravo. I'll push the button this week. Push it. I'll push the first button I'll come across. I'll wipe them all out. Keep watching the news, sis. You'll see me there. Sorry. Video call. Hate it. I could be making love. Sorry, princess. Yes? See you. I got my sock. Come on! Don't bother. What's your name? - Sevcan, sir. - What kind of a name is that? Just a name. Bad name, very lame. What's with the socks? Who shot you? Shot? We're always like this. So it was a shot and run? Boss is laughing. I don't. But look... I can make people laugh. Call an ambulance. Ekrem, get an ambulance. Are you growing eyebrows? - Eyebrows? - Don't move your eyebrows. Yes, Chief. Somebody should stay with him. Damn. Take it easy, Casanova. Let me catch my breath and I'll deal with you too. Get that pimp! Come and get it yourself. You're of age. Man... ...would you please... ...be so kind... ...and get this pimp! - Come on. Shame on you. Let me enjoy one cigarette. Sorry, Chief. The guys are very tired from the operations. Why didn't you tell them? Huh? I have an octave issue. You know that. I know, Chief. It's a condition. When I get mad I lose my octave. It's a disease. Why didn't you tell the guys? Sorry, Chief. I'll take care of it. Jeez. Cover those eyebrows. It's catching my eye. Look at me. Come here. Keep still. Are you feeling better, you pimp? I told you so. You're wasting this good stuff, that makes me mad. Shut up. Listen to the music. This is an aria. Aria. Aria, aria. - Aria? - Yes, do you like it? Oh, it's that pop song, right? Maria! It's aria. Ignorant fool. Read and learn stuff. Listen to classical music. What's this affection for classical music? Were people bombed with classical music while I was sleeping and I was saved? Listen, mate. I'm tired. We have you know. How about we put you into witness protection? You'll become our witness. And we'll all have it easy. Witness protection? Is this the animal protection department? Take him to the DA. He had it coming. - Move. Take him. - Get up! Wait, wait. Boss. Alright. We didn't listen to Tchaikovsky yet. Take him! Boss! I'm so fond of classical music. Ignorant idiot. Ignorant. Ignorant fool, just enjoy it. You don't know what I've been through Boss? You're getting younger every day. You've come early. Coming early is a big issue, boss. I stole two bikes, how about that? Were they rough on you? No. They tried but in vain. They tried to make me talk by using classical music. We're used to it, thanks to you. Thanks to my fiancée, not me. God bless your fiancée then. They took me to the attorney who asked for my ID. I said "No ID." They couldn't find any records. So they made a background check and I fled when I had the chance. - I did them a favor. - Why is that? It's not certain if I'm alive or not. They don't know who they're looking for and won't search any further. Nice. Get this lad some tea. To hell with Tchaikovsky but he saved me. Sit. - Sorry, madam. - Asli, what is it? You're no good. There's not much time to the concert and you're not ready. I'm sorry, madam. It's just that... My head is somewhere else. I just can't concentrate. I'm going through emotional changes. It must be that. Pull yourself together, I don't want to see you like this. That's no good. Maybe you should cancel. Alright. I'm sorry. Asli! Hold on. Don't step on it, wait! - Wait a second. - Come. - Asli? - Honey. - Are you alright? - Yes. I've twisted my ankle. - Let's see a doctor now. - There's no need to, honey. I'll be okay soon. How sweet. Did my romantic lover buy me flowers again? These are for you. Thank you. We should put some ice on it. Let me get you some. Alright. Let me put my foot here. That's better, right? What's up Canberk? Come over. Why don't you sit down? Put these on. Put them on. Am I visually impaired, Canberk? I'm not, right? If I every see you touch Asli... ...I'll stick that ice in your ass. Now fuck off. The concert is very close. Are you excited, dear? I'm more than excited. I practice even at home. I love this song. Every time the same emotions. It reminds me of the tango scene with Al Pacino. Remember? Of course I do. I can never forget it. I watched it a hundred times, with the same effect. Same here. Classical music is passion. This tune is actually part of Mozart's 40. symphony. But Carlos Gardel steals it and makes a tango out of it. Wow. My sweetheart knows everything. Yeah, some know-it-all. Did you like the dessert? Yes, it was nice. Well, well, well. Our mate is busy with delicate matters. What are you doing, you romantic bum? I think you've mistaken me with someone else. What are you on? Are you high? I don't know who you are, sir. You must have mistaken me. You were not like this last night. - You were shooting at us. - Kerem? Honey, would I ever know such guy. Come on. Would you please leave? I don't know you. Dude, you don't know us? How not? - Are you disrespecting us? - Sir. Fu... This is going too far. Just leave. I don't know you, alright? What are you on? Did you take pills? Be grateful that you're with women. Or else... ...I would show you what a big mistake you made. Come on, let's go. - These guys are crazy. - Unbelievable. - Some maniacs. - What was that? I apologise to you all, really. Honey, it's not your fault. Let's not get upset, never mind. There's no place for nightingales in this fading garden any more. What are you looking at, idiots? These were lyrics. Play, you fools! I have great aim, right? Well done, Boss. Bulls eye. I can hit them eyes closed. Look now. All three are down, Boss. Who is it at this hour? Hello? Yes, my Sultana? We got stuck in traffic. Do you hear the ambulance? They don't make way for the ambulance. People are so cruel these days. Alright, I'm on the way. Don't worry. Play, you fools! What kind of a woman are you? You've wasted my life! Why do you make me suffer? I'll make you sorry for it! Servet! Why do you yell? Who are you talking to? My Sultana, they always hear your voice, I wanted them to hear me this time. Where have you been? Well my Sultana, we got stuck in Istanbul's traffic. Don't give me that traffic crap. Each time you're late you talk about "Istanbul traffic"! Don't yell, my Sultana. You see, I'm loaded. Don't put them out in the open! The 1st Army doesn't have this many weapons. I'm fed up with you. Fed up! You're so lovely again tonight, my Sultana. Listen. I'm going to bed now. If I hear any gun shot I'll make you regret it. Do you hear me? Yes, guys. - Welcome, Chief. - Where are we? Did you get the phone calls? Sat images? What about intelligence? CIA? KGB? FBI? SAT. Dude, don't make me count. Where are we? Chief, we're recording the conversations as evidence. The gang constantly changes their numbers but Kerem Babayigit the son of the gang leader uses the same number. And he talks to the girl he is in love with. - Love, huh? Must be a code. - No, Chief. It's really about love. "Honey, you hang up first." "No, you hang up." These are mobsters. It's a code. "Hang up first." No Chief, he's a man of love. It's constantly "I love you, I'm dying for you." He really got to me. I take flowers home every day. It's not clear if he's a poet or a gang leader. And what are you? - Does the girl have a record? - No, Chief. She's clean. What would a clean girl have to do with the mafia? Anyway, we're going ahead with the operation. First we'll show up in Dolapdere. We'll check around and then do the raids. - Alright? - Yes, Chief. - Do you get me, flower boy? - Yes. Get those eyebrows trimmed. You got more eyebrows than a couple of guys together. Eye browser. How are you going to fix this? I don't know, Haktan. My soul is in turmoil. I've lost my mind. Did you ever think about how these two families could come together? It's impossible, Boss. Look at the neighborhood. Look at the people. They all have criminal records. Just go to their neighborhood. They all have jobs and are well-off. Your families are of different worlds, Boss. - First of all, quality... - Fuck quality. Asli would be very upset if she found out. That's my only concern. I can't do this to her. She doesn't know anything, that's bad. Sometimes I think... ...I should go to dad... ...and tell him everything. To hell with it. Hey. Girl. What are you doing there? - Don't make me shoot you. - Shoot me, Haktan. - Shoot me in the heart! - Go girl! Turn on the volume! Girls, turn on the volume! Bro? This song is our gift to you, to your lover. - How do you know? - Oh dear brother. When you are mad all Dolapdere and Tarlabasi trembles with fear. Now that you're in love... ...all the girls here suffer from pangs of love. My handsome, romantic brother. Turn on the volume! Let all Dolapdere listen to this fucking song. Play. Boss, it's the 73rd time. Should they play another song? Dude, you'll play what I want. Just play! Well, my brave boy. Come on, lad. Sit. - Enjoy it, dad. - Thanks, son. - I want to talk about something. - Talk. I fell in love with a girl. I'm getting married. Good. Who's she? Let's ask for her hand in marriage. I had it done. You had it done? Do you have another father, you fool? Don't go there. Things are messed up. Good. We'll abduct her if we have to. I have only one son. Get married soon so that I can hold my grandchildren. Dad, let's not abduct anyone. I just wanted you to know. We have a wedding. At the beginning of next month. Lorke. Lorke. Please accept our apologies. We were abroad, on a business trip. That's why I couldn't come to ask for her hand in marriage. Yes. And we thought that the couple that came last time were Kerem's parents. We're quite surprised now. That's completely our son's mistake. There's no engagement without parents, right? And what is your line of business, Mr. Servet? Wheeling and dealing. What are you dealing? My hubby loves to deal with everything. Let me explain My father is in the transportation business and that's what he meant. Right, dad? Exactly. Yes. So, how are you again? Fine, thank you. Looks like you have a large family. - Who are the guys outside? - Nephews. Do you travel together? Since we're a large family my dad doesn't like to travel alone. -That's just it. I'm glad they didn't come in. Excuse me? I said it's nice to have a large family. Yes, they all love me. Yes. Praise be, your daughter is beautiful. I have only one son. And he fell in love. If he's in love I don't care about details. And you've given away your daughter already. So we'll have to do the wedding. Yes but... ...we think it's a bit early for a wedding. - They should get to know each other... - No. It's not good to postpone it. We want to hold grandchildren in our arms. You've given her away, we'll do the wedding. Congratulations. See you at the wedding. Oh no, please don't get up. - Mom, please. - Good evening. Good evening. I'll show them out. - Welcome. - Thank you. I wish you were here. They just left. - I got held up. - Come. You didn't miss much, Danyal. No, I like my in-law. He looks like a nice guy. - What's his profession? - Wheeling and dealing. - How's that? - Transportation. He's such a nice guy. Like a gentleman from Istanbul. What matters is what he moves... Good joke, I shouldn't forget this. It makes people laugh. We're giving our girl to a transporter. You finished a French college, done masters in France. And now marry the son of a transporter. That's life. Honey, please don't aspire to become a bourgeois. The heart may choose the son of a transporter... or the son of an aristocrat. That's right. Don't be upset, my princess. Come on, Sis. You're my sister. We're have the same parents. But she is "That's life" and I am "salamalaikum." It happens, we're human. As long as he's beneficent to his country, it's fine. I've missed the guy again. I'm busy. What can I do? I'm even more busy than last time. You know the gang I told you about. We've kept on, kept on and are finally in the last stretch. It's almost done. Just a matter of time. It's real a matter of time. We'll catch them. I just thought you might be interested in what I'm busy with. Sis. - So, we got the girl. - We sure did, dad. I own half of Istanbul now. Of course I'll get a girl for my son. I could even get her dad tomorrow. What are you talking about? Why that? It was a joke. I never know when you're joking. So, how is she? Beautiful, right? Good for my boy. May God protect you from evil eyes. Amen. Her mother is stuck-up. "I'm like this and that." Hussy. Sultana, she's no match for you. Of course not. I wouldn't even play cooncan with her. But I'll have to put up with her, just for our son. We'll have the wedding soon, right? - We'll do, my son. - You're the man. You really are. Dad. Sometimes I think... ...we should quit this business? Look... ...it's possible to have a clean life. We are so deep in this swamp it won't let us go even if we want to. Do you think your dad didn't try? I don't know, mom. Sometimes I wish it was different. The hell needs people too. If everyone was to be good there wouldn't be goodness and no hell and heaven. This is our test. You're right. What can I say? But I fell in love. I got butterflies and ants all over me. Are you a horse? Horses love butterflies. I fell in love too. Your mother gave you to me. Ask her. I wanted to quit but it's not happening. When you give me a grandchild I may quit it all. Bravo, Servet. Is everything ready for tomorrow's operation? It is. This time we'll get the leaders at a wedding. What wedding? According to phone data, the wedding will be the best place. Good. Dude, my niece has a wedding too. I hope you don't bust her wedding. Would be hilarious. Hell no, Chief. The head of Organized Crime would never give her niece to the mafia. They wouldn't take a girl from you. That's not likely. Even the joke is bad. Yes. What is it? First we'll bust Dolapdere, with a crew of 100. Then we're going to raid some warehouses simultaneously. And then we'll bust the wedding and get the gang leaders. Well done. You're winning my favor. Look. I got you a nice gift. Do you know what this is? What, Chief? A spring-comb. - Here. - Chief, you're so kind. - Heavy combing. - Chief got me a mustache comb. Comb your eyebrows. I'll join the operation in Dolapdere. And then I'll go to the wedding? As you wish, sir. Resat? What did you do with Haktan? You transferred him to jail, right? Chief, everything happened so fast. He suspect escaped on the way to the hospital. How's that? He's a purse snatcher. My one and only son says goodbye to single life. All the single girls are heavily drinking tonight. Come on. Do the Babayigit's live here? - Yes, Chief. - Break the door. Get the ram, break the door. Get in. - Break the door! - Yes, Sir! - Police! - What's going on? Go in there! Get them! Bro! - I'm reading here. - Come down. - Damn, come down. - Come! Take him! Looks like you're in charge. Get lost. Take him! Pimp. - Get in! - Move, move. - Take them. - Did my sister call? No, Chief. Not yet. Chief, it's not a good time... ...but why don't you ever smile? Oh dear Resat, I want to smile. I lost my smiling muscles at an operation. - Who's shooting? - Boss, the cops. Oh fuck! Don't run! Police! Stop! Police! Why do you run in the barbershop, soaked in sweat? I didn't run for a long time. I thought I should exercise. Don't turn me in that direction. Why don't you wear a tracksuit? You're right. Cut just a bit. Thank you. You look sharp, dad. Sharp as a knife. Thanks. It could cut flies. Cut of their wings. My boy. Asli, you look beautiful, my friend. The most beautiful bride on earth. Thank you. Kerem would swallow his tongue if he saw you. I'm sure he looks so handsome now. - Is he not here yet? - He must be on the way. Come on. Welcome. - How do I look? - Breathtaking, my beautiful child. You are beautiful. This is your most special day. I'm proud to have a daughter like you. I didn't trust Kerem first but... ...now I see that he's the best choice for you, honey. May you be happy a lifetime. Oh, mom. My sweet mom. Thank you. We love each other so much. You can be sure of that. We'll be happy all our lives. Don't worry. God willing, my child. Dad. My beautiful daughter. My beautiful daughter. You're everything to me. The guy you would marry has always been important to me. I hope you'll be happy. I hope so, dad. You've always been a role model for me. A good husband to my mom, a good father to me. I'm sure that Kerem will be just like you. Hope so. Asli, everybody is ready. Kerem has arrived. - Let's go. - Let's not keep the guests waiting. I'll get ready and come down. You, Asli, daughter of Nejat. Do you accept Kerem, son of Servet as your spouse? Yes. Nobody move! This is a police raid! Babayigit family, you're under arrest! - Dad. - This is a raid! Haktan. Sit down, stay calm. Kerem Babayigit, you're under arrest. Take him. Just a second. I'll tell you everything. Alright? Move. Move. Come on, move! Play! Come on, move! Move. Look ahead! Mom? The purse-snatching gang case... ...which has nearly 250 members, has been resolved today. Kerem Babayigit, the well-known leader of the underworld... ...has been sentenced to 15 years and is not transferred to jail. Mr. Kerem, any comments? Mr. Kerem, did you force people to snatch purses? Mom. It's alright, honey. Come, before the rose of my love fades away I wish that my heart could talk If only you knew your place in my little world I wrote your name in my heart with invisible letters Come, before the rose of my love fades away I wish that my heart could talk If only you knew your place in my little world I wrote your name in my heart with invisible letters There has never been such a love Not in the past, nor will be in the future They couldn't find such in dreams They can't find you, your name is in my heart Well, that's how the story of the girl waiting for her Prince Charming ends. The romantic, handsome, kind, gentle prince turned out to be a bully who could shoot anyone. He was a nightmare to everybody. A true but bitter story came to an end. Don't take my word for it when I say "end". Love doesn't care about Prince Charming and such.
