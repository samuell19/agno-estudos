Thentho, The Relampagos, Os Catalixo, Libert City, Aloprados… Cretinos, MDB, Cariri, AGN, Opera, OQT. Statos, Sexo 4, A Firma, Mortos, H20, PRDS… Krelos, Xuim, Ossos, The Malocas… In that time they were: Os Tais, Os Melhores, Os + Q Todos, Os Piores… JE, Arsenal. Corvos, Museu, Trapos, DBoys, ONU, AKDS, Loucura, Arrepio… We just don't give a fuck, you know? We get there, and there is a bunch of rich guys, assholes, and a bunch of hypocrites. We come up there and do what we gotta do, no shame. And if someone says anything, we argue, and if we have to, we'll beat them up, you know? We argue back, we do argue. It's about facing them, you know? We don't care. "Pixador" flash it to everyone. It's pure anarchy, it's hate, y'know? Damn, adrenaline is rushing, it's tough. Yeah bro, that's what I'm checking. - We're doing it individually - but we gotta hold each other's hands. - Alright. - Stuff like that. - Let's go. It's getting harder and harder. This building here it's insane, bro. Fuck, adrenaline is still rushing, man. It's a crazy scene, man. It's just like that man, there is a lot of people down there looking at us. This thing almost broke here, bro. Go, go, go. Help me. I don't know if i can go on, climbing through here, bro. We received a complaint on the radio about two people that were climbing a building on the outside. Do you know, rats? Going up, floor by floor. And I thought "what the fuck is that?" According to the complaint it seems to be a resident, someone that lives here went out the window and started to climb the building. At first, we tought it was a "pixador", but we didn't find any painting, there are no windows broken or anything like that… We just checked because suddenly they all disappeared. The ghetto is much different from Alphaville. Alphaville, it's an apartment complex, it's a luxury thing, y'know. Ghetto is veryidifferent from luxury stuff. The inhabitants are not the same, bro. It's like… from the ghetto, y'know man? "Pixo", bro, "pixo" is a heart thing, bro. For us. "pixo" is a reward, bro. For us, that live in ghetto, as we don't have how to make it, we "pixo", man. It runs in our blood, you can't stop it, y'know? When I get older I'll keep doing it. Even on crutches I'm going to "pixo". The "pixador", the criminal. He wants to "pixo" it all, spoiling, destroying. All of them are children of the evil. I smoke weed, damn it! I smoke it here motherfucker. In São Paulo there are many categories of "pixo". There are people that only "pixo" walls. There are some that just do windows. Others that just do buildings. There are others that do climbing. And there are those who do it all. But the main point of "pixo", in São Paulo, aside its categories, is to do a lot of "pixo". São Paulos"pixo" is a closed communication, it's from "pixo" to "pixo". So, it really doesn't communicate with the rest of society. It's an aggression. Its purpose is to attack society. The "pixo" in São Paulo is unique, there is nowhere else in the world. The foreigners come to Brazil to check the graffiti scene, and when they see the "pixo" they end up dropping graffiti and want to learn more about "pixo". They want to know more about it, because there's nothing like it, it's audacious, in a urban center as São Paulo The city is huge, third or fourth biggest is the world, and all the buildings have "pixo". Man, I breathe "pixo" twenty-four hours per day. I just love it, dude. I work as a motoboy, up and down, twelve hours on a bike all day long. At some point, I'm in Santo Amaro, next I'm in São Miguel Paulista, then I head to Osasco, following to Itaim Paulista, and so on. I'm always around, I'm always accompanying "pixo", y'know. Honestly, it's difficult to spot a street in São Paulo that I haven't sprayed. The city of São Paulo has become an agent of vertical letters, which means, the writing of "pixo" in São Paulo is going to follow the guidelines of the city. It's almost as if the city of São Paulo was a huge notebook, and the "pixador" are filling those spaces, y'know? The "pixo" hold a mask. A lot of people find it ugly, that it was done by some animal. But it's a matter of conviviality; it's about learning to realize it. You have to see the beauty of it. The "pixador" when he creates his logo, he seeks for an original letter, in order to catch attention on the streets. It's just not a bunch of doodles. There is a creative process behind, a very elaborative. artistic process on the making of the logo. When São Paulo's "pixo" emerged in the 80's, those youngsters were highly influenced by the culture of Heavy Metal, Punk Rock, Hardcore, Rock. So, "pixo", in fact, migrated from the punk movement in the early 80's. They got inspired in the logos of rock bands to create their own logos. So, the beggining was like that, you could observe the A in Iron Maiden's cover. and work on letters from that. And the band's logos were inspired by the Anglo-Saxons's runes of millions of years ago, which are indeed the first European Alphabet. That was used by the Germanics, Scandinavians and Anglo-Saxons… and the "pixador" have perfected this writing and built on it, it's a anthropophagi. They created on top of that, it's actually an evolution after that. There is a creative process behind, a very elaborative artistic process It's amazing how the writing of the barbarians of many centuries ago has migrated to São Paulo to its barbarians: the "pixadores". I started with "pixo" when I was 12, that on 1996. From 1996 until 2004 I've dedicated myself to "pixo". Since 2004, I had to stop, because I've had legal problems, and also because I've started a family. So, I decided to dedicate myself to register the movement, because our movement was going blank, you know. There were no register of it. I work with two "pixo" DVD labels, which are "Sem Comédia (Without Humor)" and "Escrita Urbana (Urban Writing)". So, I use the "Escrita Urbana" for those that do walls, the oldschool stuff and the "Sem Comédia" for those who roll up the buildings and climb windows. For those "pixo" monsters, those who are fully dedicated to São Paulo's "pixo". A while back, when the night fell I used to go out I jumped the fences, with my painting You know how that goes A brush of thirty, full of paint I ripped up the nights Climbed to the top, and to the roof You know what's up The cops used to catch us, beat us up Painted my face, humiliated me But I didn't stop, I kept on because something had hypnotized me Crazy dude, dangerous one lused to have a lot of fun Now, I've quit, but the fun moments are alive in my memory I used to "pixo", and I had a blast I do remember every second of it I used to "pixo", and I had a blast I do remember every second of it Unfortunately, "pixo" is a step towards crime They begin to steal, to rob It's a harm to society I've never been a part of it, and never will Be a part of the crime team It only generates discord up in the hood I want it all to end I read the walls, check the popularity The guys that are active It reminds me of the days that I used to paint. I miss it so much I used to "pixo", and I had a blast I do remember every second of it I used to "pixo", and I had a blast I do remember every second of it I used to "pixo", and I had a blast I do remember every second of it I used to "pixo", and I had a blast I do remember every second of it And now, we're going to see how the material turned out, bro. It was cool, we stayed as far as we could. The dudes will be locked uip, lbut we did our job. - Isn't it so, Choque? - For sure, man. Climbing is the A-class in "pixo" nowadays, bro. Who climbs is the one that wants to be noticed. He's not satisfied by doing the first or second floor. He wants to do it all, the whole building, top to bottom. So, I climbed a building over at Vila Mariana, on Vergueiro's Avenue. Outside climbing, you know. It's crazy, because it's an insane scene, y'know. It's full of adrenaline. Only the one that do it can can understand it. I thought it was going to ruin fast, because it's a major avenue, there's a lot of traffic there. And when I was up there I almost had a mishap, there was a loosen strap and I slipped over a little bit, luckily I could hold on the wire. High up there, at the very top is the real deal, dude. It's even better when it's a residencial building, and there is people live there. Business buildings are easy, there is a lot of people coming and going. But a residence building this big, in a busy area like this one is the best. Everybody stares at you with a puzzled face. My deal is "pixo", it's nothing like graffiti. I don't like it. Graffiti is a commercial thing, they do it to make money. This "pixo" in São Paulo, as we know it, it's not the pioneer. The first one is the political "pixo" the one against the dictatorship, which started in the 60s and was basically the "No more Dictatorship!". Its nature was political. Tihere were no esthetic concerns with th? writing The point was to be readable to anyone. After the dictatorship's "pixo" that is the political "pixo", started the poetic "pixo"which is self-explanatory, it's about poetic phrases And in the early 80s as a outspread of Punk Movement's "pixo", which was also a political "pixo", started the São Paulo's "Pixo", which focuses in the "pixador's" ego. The precursor was the Brazilian Mastiff Dog. in Anhanguera's road, km 26, that actually was not done by a "pixador" as we know them to be nowadays. He was the owner of a Mastiff breeder, that used to sell dogs, and he tagged the whole city with that "pixo". "Brazilian Mastiff Dog, Km 26" I was a huge fan of the Mastiffs at that time. When I was a child, I used to see a Mastiff dog "pixo" and say: "Wow, who is this Mastiff dog?". I used to see "onion", "doll", but I didn't know that it was "pixo". And then, once, I got a tiny brush with yellow painting, I still remember. It was a tiny brush, and a can of yellow paint, we tagged the poles. I live in the South side, y'know? After that I've started tagging Avenues, South side avenues. Then I've started… I used to go to Carrefour supermarket, used to get lots of paint cans, that was when I started to roll. In The early 80s, specifically in 82, "pixo" really begun to grow, with Juneca, Bilao and Pessoinha, whose were also inspired on the Mastiff Dog paintings, and that was when "pixo" really came around. They started in theis neighborhoods and spread to other regions. In 1985 was the peak, during Janio Quadros mandate, the City Hall started to chase them, because they were doing "pixo" in the whole city. In the late 80s, the buildings started to be targets of "pixo". For me, the iron trio, whom were the biggest three building taggers, the best ones that really were outstanding in the "pixo" history, are Di, Thentho and Xuim They were the pioneers, it was a cool battle to watch, it was about who could do more "pixo". One of them would do "pixo" in a place, the other one would follow and "pixo" by the side, doing something bigger or higher… They disputed among them. They did "pixo" a lot, in many buildings but Di kept doing that. Because many "pixador", when they reach legal age, they quit. After they quit, came the guy who immortalized this category, his name was Di. He did a lot of "pixo", y'know? He's still considered the guy that did more "pixo" in São Paulo's history. Aside from "pixo" a lot of buildings, he also spread "pixo" in a lot of communities. He will be forever remembered in the "pixo" world. On top of his work, he managed to "pixo" one of the most coveted buildings in São Paulo. The "Conjunto Nacional". Just after he finished it, he called the journalists, pretending to be one of the residents and told them what had happened. Tihe article was published as if he was indeed a resident, but he was the one who had "pixo" it. Hey, y'all… Let's make some noise! When I count 'till 3, everyone is going to shout "R.I.P. Kidão ". One, two, three… RIP, Kidão! Di was murdered. He took so many risks in his life and ended up dying in a bathroom, in a bar fight. Damn dude, Lixo did several "pixo", Xuim did a bunch too, but 'till today, nobody has topped Di. There were too many buildings, bro, too many buildings. It is because of these guys that buildings became a "pixo" style. Look at the size… turn here, turn here. Look at the size of this building. Be my guest, bro. First, it's about adrenaline. I'm not leaving my house, waste my night to "pixo" some fence or door. Everyone can tag that. In my point of view, without belittle anyone, the adrenaline deal, the real "pixo", is to climb things, to go into them and "pixo" buildings, and stuff like that. That's how I see it, others may think it differentely. I had never done a building before. I was so scared. I almost cried. I was in panic, there was a huge noise, while the guy tried to break the door in Bico's house. By the time that he broke up the door, he was forcing with his body weight and he felt and the door opened. The moon was just in front of the door, I stayed at the hallway, in the apartment, just starring at the moon. And I thought "Oh my God, what in the world is this?" - Bye bye doorman! - Thanks doorman! Bye. - Good night, have a great time at work. - Thank you, boss. Mission accomplished. What's up Isaac? Do you have wine? - Wine, yes. - How much? Here, it's written "Opera", and it is missing a T here, from "Operation". Over here it's written Osasco. "Pixo" is our deal. We dominate it. Everyone that "pixo" is one of us, bro. And most of "pixador" are not the bourgeoisie. They are all from the hoods. There is only a few playboys that do "pixo". I learned to make it through without money. I learned to live without a penny in my pocket, and to catch a train or subway I had to enter by the window. I learned to live with my cravings. A lot of people from ghetto, that suffer with poverty. would like to speak up, to express themselves, but they can't. The only ones who have the right to say something, the ones that can comment on things are those who own money. I think that there are three main motivations for a "pixador" to get involved with this street culture. First is the social recognition, second comes hobby and adrenaline, and the third one is the protest aspect of it. The government wants a dumb nation, people that are stupid and without education. We are "pixador" but none of us is stupid. Everybody reads newspaper, and knows what's going on. When we met, we were ready to be on media. We "pixo" walls to be on TVs, newspapers, internet, everything that is possible. Even on cellphones, if this is to get publicity, we're in. We are doing our job. We do our protests, our indignations on walls, and that is that. Where happened a murder or at someone's that is doing anything illegal. If his house doesn't have a wall, we will do it on the house in front of it, on his neighbor… What really matter is that we leave a message to him. When he gets up in the morning, he will see and think about it: "Man, they won't stop bothering me.". They might not get arrested, but they will have to deal with that. All eyes are on him. The politicians will see that we know what is going wrong. This is the voice of the nation right here, on the walls. Printed letters, bro. Those are printed letters, and those I don't understand. I was in school for 8 years, graduate from middle school, but those letters I don't understand, y'know. I just read "pixo". Those words I can't read, y'know. I'm kind of unlettered, but "pixo" I understand very well. Some letters I know. but there are things I can't understand. As this one, it says "A…renewed…", "A renew". No, I do not understand. There you have: Biscoito [Cookie], Ponta [Edge], Zoi and AGN. We always hang out to do "pixo" together. Here it's written: CRTN, MDB, Cariri, Pavilhão 9. Pavilhão 9 There it's written "Rilax", bro. My mom used to say: "How is that you can't read letters, and you can"pixo"? And I told her that even that, I don't know. Just a few do what we do, y'know Surfing is way crazy, yo. Only the insane ones do it. It's just like you're on the top of a building tagging it, ripping it off. But the building is moveless, and the train is moving. It's another type of adrenaline. "L.I." means Incurable Insanity. Sometimes I used to "pixo" huge letters, and people told me: "Man, that "pixo" is awesome, it's animalistic!" The animal thing ended up sticking and I thought: "Animal, really? So that is what I am going to "pixo" here: Animal.". "Pixo" became the hood's sport. It's entertainment for them. - What's up? We are searching the perfect snack! - Where is McDonald's? I'm going to bust it up. - All right, bro. - There is nothing there, man. - Let's roll, bro! - Look at this perfect sandwich. Look at this, Djan. Tell me it ain't perfect? Tell me. You can have this one. Go on! - Thank McTrash for it. Gimme a bite of McTrash. - McDonalds! It's the trash of the restaurant. My name is Sebastião, I'm the janitor, at the Agripina's Condo since 1989. I love my job, and I really care about this building, and also for my housing, it's not easy to find good housing nowadays. They were sitting there, and suddenly they came and broke this frame, They were sitting there, and suddenly they came and broke this frame, they climbed up here and observed, trying to figure it out, how they would start. Those kids are from the ghetto. They see bad things all day long, so it's easy to practice the crime. Crime is an easy deal, bro. You put a gun over someone's head, and that's it. You break into a house, bro, you climb a building, you break in, open a window, bust a lock, bust two. It's easy, so, why not steal? I have some legal issues, some minor ones. Homicide, burglary. "You Son of a bitch! I'm going to kill you". They ghatered up here and started to run. I jumped, without even think. When I jumped, the roof went down and I got hooked on something. I was hanging with my butcher's knife, and I wanted to cut them up but I couldn't… I yelled: "Son of a bitch, I'm going to cut you up". The guys ran away and I was stuck on something, I couldn't get out of there. So, the conflict between "Os mais Imundos" and the "RGS" started in 1998; and it was kind of surprising in "pixo" world because they were buddies, they used to roll toghether and used to vandalize São Paulo together. And even because they were so tight, some enviousness began, some disagreements among them, personal problems that culminated in a battle. And there was death, physical aggression and a lot of rumors. It has been 10 years of rivalry, many were beaten up, many others even died because of it. Barata from "Arsenal" and the deceased Mario, have beaten up Telo at the meeting. They stabbed him, punched him. - They hurt Telo a lot. - and it didn't go worse because I stopped them. Pezao told them: " It was Preto, such and such…". So, Telo stole the cans from "Arsenal" with Chileno. Preto went to Telo's house, with some guys from the "Mais Imundos". Chiuaua gave 5 cans to the guys so they could go "pixo", he left it close to Carmozina. So, you came up to Preto and told him to return the cans. So, in the end, Telo stole the cans. But if they didn't give it back, Telo was going to beat every AKDS he sees. - But, before that… - I said I was not going to hold Telo back. - And Telo said he would pay for the cans. - Both are wrong, both sides are wrong. So what happened was that both were wrong, right? And that is how the rivalry started. The oldschool guys were quiting, but the youngsters, those who were starting to "pixo" just kept the fight. Today, in São Paulo, there is no conflict anymore, but in the countryside it doesn't seem that it will end. The countryside boys don't even know why they are fighting, they don't know how it started, they just want to be a part of it, to be enemies of something. Almost as soccer team rivalry, like Corinthians and Palmeiras, Flamengo and Fluminense and the "Os Mais Imundos" and the "Os RGS". Only the "RGS" on the scene, on the heart. I love this, and it is done, over and done. Not everyone falls into crime. I am a worshiper of the Lord, I go to the church every Sunday, and for me "pixo" is a wonderful thing, which is increasing my social network, nice and good people. Well, I have a Bachelor's Degree, I'm a law graduate. And I'm a "pixador", I'm a law graduate and I'm breaking the law But the "pixador" has coherent thoughts, we are not ignorants, we are protestants. I used to stay home all the time, and there was a time I couldn't leave it. I felt bad. I stepped outside and I felt my body shaking. It looked like I had a watermelon in my throat, I couldn't breathe, like some sort of depression, anxiety. It's a disease that is affecting youth nowadays. I went to psychiatrists and psychologists, Between that I used to see "pixo" and I missed to see mine on the walls too. I was taking medicines, which was Fluoxetine, for anxiety. But my true therapy was "pixo", my tranquilizer, y'know? I used to say: "Man, all my bros are doing "pixo"and I'm not doing anything because of this disease, that I can't get rid of on my own.". So I started going out, breaking away with my cans, my heart pounding, I started "pixo" again. I freed myself, I used to do a neighborhood per walk. After every walk I thought: "Man, I'm walking, I'm cured, this thing won't rule me anymore.". Zero Six, go on. Apparently, someone has tried to break in to steal something, right? For us, the police, was tiresome, because we worked at "ROTA" and we liked to catch criminals. To chase and catch them. And sometimes we used to see people doing "pixo". - Where is the other one? - It's just he and I. - No, there were 3. - We were going to "pixo" there. - I didn't understand. - We were going to "pixo" this building, up there. - We were going to do it, sir. That is the truth. - Have you been booked yet? - No, sir. Jail? To get arrested is a part of it. It depends, sometimes police prefer to beat us up, others like to paint, and others prefer to do both. Some will beat you, paint you and take you to the police station to sign the process, y'know. They like to paint, you know. Someone bald like me, they like to paint hair. That is fucked up. They made me drink the painting, and luckily it was a thin paint, and they made me bite the painting roll. So I did it and he said: "No, you have to swallow it.". It was a foam paint roller, and there was no way to swallow it. But they wanted me to eat it. So, I held it in my mouth and started to chew, then they told me to walk away. Sometimes you can get arrested, sometimes there's just a police car, you can cross with a crazy policeman that may take your clothes off and leave you on your underwear. Police can throw you on the river. Tactical Force in Belem. The policemen all drugged, playing roussian roulette, putting the can in someone's head, pretending they'd shoot. They are all out of their minds, you don't know what they may do. The police caught us, threw paint in our shoes, heads. But we left, they let us leave. And later, we bumped into the special operation force. And they said: "you're a bunch of "pixador". But they liked to play, y'know. A shock here, a shock there, and we were jumping from one side to the other, and they kept on teasing us. They like to play with human beings. What do I see? They like to face the police. They are not afraid of policemen. If he gets beaten up, he'll run away. Even if he gets caught in action, he'll go to the station and will walk away. So there isn't a punishment, and that is needed, even if it is a small one. If you make them spend 2 weekends per month to paint a school, that is a punishment for "pixador". The policeman is obligated to take him to th station. There are some that make some mistakes, make them eat, beat them. And that is when the police commits the crime, instead of the "pixador". And he can even be convicted for omission. There was a time when we were tagging the Marginal, and cops showed up. shot right by the side of my ear, the cap fell by my feet. He asked my if I knew how to pray and we started to pray Our Father, and the cop yelled: "Go on, damn it! I cannot hear you!" And we yelled: "Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name…" And he hit me, bro. I think he spent half an hour beating me up. The scene was crazy, my foot was broken and all that stuff. He kicked me a lot and I told him I had done a surgery, that's when he said: "Oh really? So, get this." He kicked me and then I just walked away. I found one can, and I want to find the other one that is here. When the policeman does that, he's taking matter in his own hands, and that is worthless. For the tagger, it's stimulating, nothing happens to him. The best thing is to go back there and rip off the same place, where he caught me. Everything is bad, It's terrible to get slapped by a man. A suit up cop makes fun of you like hell, and what can you do? When it is a street guard, you can fight back. You hit them back and run. But when it's the police, it's fucked up, man. - You're going to go through the building next door, - and climb through balconies, okay? - Got it? - Got it. - Get down, please. - We're going to do an art there. - You're doing no shit there. - Why not, bro? - Because I said so. - Is it yours, man? - What is yours here? - I am taking care of it. - What are you taking care of? - I take care of the building. Do you do it from the other side of the street? Do you think I can't see? - Why are you calling the pigs? - Okay then, go up. - Yes I will, and what are you going to do? - There are other 4 up there, are you cool with that? I think it's about to get bad for you. - While I go up, they are going to argue with you. - Bring it on. - Do you think that I'm lying, huh? - Take care of your business, fool, don't snitch people. The "point" is downtown, is where everybody goes, from all hoods. People from East, West, South, North, everywhere. Normally, when taggers attend meetings, which are called "points", they trade autographs, a piece of paper, nothing more than an A4 sheet, with the "pixador's" signature. It's a way to show respect, to honor the other. They collect these papers, keeping them in a plastic folder, just like a sticker album, but that has a great value within the "pixo" scene. Because, actually, this is the only historical document of "pixo". Because "Pixo" is an ephemeral intervention, it will vanish, it will be washed sometime. My entertainment, my hangs out are the "points", the "pixo's parties". That's how I have fun. They do the invitations, showing who is hosting the party, "party of such and such "pixo", for example, Kripta's "pixo" party… And state the sponsors and partners, those that help with the party. It's a way to promote one's "pixo", like a business party. - Hi, Serra. How are you? - Good. - Let me take this opportunity to invite you to this party. - I can't read it, because I don't have my glasses with me… - This guy is holding me up here. Nil, 2000, turn it up Now, the one holding it down with the rhyme is a "pixo's bro" Getting into the wilderness. look it up, fellow We are down in the scene We are tight Let's roll. Turn on the cam We rap, and "pixo", and don't get any rest 1,2.3… Danilo, I don't lie I came up with this crazy fool, which comes from the 55 Check it out, we are down. We are getting there… To add, rap in the air, It's in an improvise Let's roll, we are down, Only "pixadores" here, slackers 1,2, 3, you got a be a steel man, Nil is rapping, rhyme it up newbies Let's roll, for my mother that I so much love Hold up, we are getting there 1.2, 3, I'm gonna close the compass, We get up at North, and off in Osasco What's up, y'all? "Pixo" Here is where we are happy, we learn, it's a blast. The hidden parties. Sometimes the police finds out that it's a "pixo" party, they go up there, they want to hit, to beat up, to ignore. This is our movement, and it's not for everyone. Sometimes a rich guy come around with his weed, his drugs, but we don't want any of that here. In order to organize that, it takes a lot of knowledge, history, that you get from the movement. Those that like your work, people show up, we're all humble. We started collecting papers from the points and went on. "Pixo" may go away, but friendship lasts forever. When you do "pixo", you take some risks, as crossing with policemen, you may get arrested, get charged, and you also risk when you climb a window or a building, you can berak the grid, you can slip, fall and die. I think that is every "pixador's" fear: to go up, and suddenly, fall. I fell when I had no support. I was holding a can with one hand and holding on with the other one. There were some tiles, this cushioned the fall. I just had a few scratches, busted my show, but I'm still on it. - Watch the cable there. I'm warning you, pay attention. For the love of God, be careful. - Can you see? nWhere are you? Talk to me. - I don't know. - You don't know. - You're alive man, you're alive, calm down. - Wait, wait. - No man! The cable is up here: Pay attention to what I'm saying - What happened? - What you mean, bro? - What are we doing here? - We are sketching, bro. - And what happened to you? - Nothing has happened. - Can you see the cable over there? The one that the train uses. You had a shock of 3.000 volts. - All right, bro. I will do that later. Go to hell, sucker! Man, take it easy for a second. Forget about "pixo" and recover first. It's there, bro. It's only missing the Y, the B, and the A. It was God's hand, otherwise that could ended up really bad. Thank God it turned out well. Thank God, really. DANGER OF DEATH HIGH VOLTAGE So, Flip, one of the Kripta's, he was a nice guy, y'know. Let's roll, come along. A guy from the streets, life is cruel, don't cha think old buddy? I'm sorry bro. I'm a newbie, but my deal is to protest against government. The day he passed away, the day that he crashed, I interviewed him, and I couldn't even imagine that the interview would be the last time I'd see him alive. And after that, people told me had crashed that night. Politics is garbage. Politicians steal so much money, and do not get arrested, but if a dude wants to raise his family and can't make it, he gets arrested. But politicians don't go to jail, and that's why we keep on fighting. Look where we climbed yesterday, that yellow part over there. It was here that my bro' Flip had his accident, and that's his last "pixo". He was coming down, and I don't know how, if he fell, if he jumped. All I know is that he hit his leg here at the edge, flipped here, and fell here on his face. We were on the balcony, going down, on the other window: Sete, Kripta, on the one down below, there is Rapa and Radar. Guess if anyone can see those Who surrender with an open heart On the way with a happy knife Chewing the boiling hour With a smile on the wrong direction. On a cold kiss from the ground It was when the yes told me no This is blood, it is not paint This is blood, it is not paint It was when the yes told me no On a cold kiss from the ground Finding the opposite direction A smile from the toothless knife Chewing the boiling hour It's a good thing that he surrendered With an open heart But guess if anyone sees it How many artists died for their art? Now I ask you, how many "pixadores" died for their "pixo"? "Pixo" transcends the history line. It's an art that exists on the edge. Earth, and Heaven, life and death. That's "Pixo". And as a visual art's student, I took it to college. The attack was my final course research paper. I was enrolled, I had the right to do it, I've studied for 4 years. I had the right to present my painting, my practical art. Crazy for you, Corinthians! We're going to barbarize it. You cannot steal anything, alright? There are several computers and other stuff too. We'll just paint. We just want to manifest. That's all we want. It's a Fine Arts School, the main point is to do art. There's a lot of deco-art, a lot of state's marketing and a lot of bullshit, a bunch of sciolism. There are some that put pain up in the ass, fart on the screen. Artist's shit, artist's fart. Art, the real art, has other value. - No, get out! Get out of there Stop it, don't do that! It's our work. Call the security, call the guards! - Don't do that! - Arrest those motherfuckers! - Fuck, that was my work, you son of a bitch! - Leave, get out of here, you son of a bitch! - LET'S "PIXO" IT ALL! - Catch him! Get him! A group of "pixador", the college is destroyed, a huge vandalism. You have no idea. Do you think that is pretty? Look and tell me, where is the beauty of it? - Man, look at this shit. If you don't have anything to do, go paint your own house. This is a incompetent's thing, a frustrated person's activity. Someone that doesn't have a purpose for his life. So they do this filth! They're analphabets! The best thing is that she says this is art, where is the art? - Where is the art? It's the poverty art, that exposes everything we feel. The feelings nobody wants to see, that the whole world closes their eyes. so they don't have to pay attention to it. Beautiful is the sunset, the colors of the solar spectrum of the white light, where the colors come from. That brings us joy everyday. That's art. Not this shit, synthetic, stinky, that's harmful! It's the art that carries the energy of the metropolis. It takes everything with it, selfshiness, perversity, the desire to achieve the unachievable, to be the best. Do you think you can get one of this parts and sell as a piece of art? It is worth millions! Millions! "Pixo is illegal, and that's the essence, bro. If it was legal, nobody would do that. If it was like graffiti, it wouldn't even exist. That's the essence, the anarchy, the prohibited thing. What society is this? Who are we? What society is this that raises a whole generation of youth that need to express themselves through destruction? Artist leaves the building on cuffs. Look at this, see. Artist leaves handcuffed. Look at this, look. You protest, vindicate in the name of social and gets arrested. Is this art? The art of suckers, of incompetents, that says bullshit about our art. Ours is a protest, we vindicate. And we get arrested, but that is the way it is. It's not as sucker's art. Those who want to come to the streets, bring your brushes. Hey, Michel, you're handsome! You're amazing! Sometimes we think: "Look at the damage we caused", but we find it beautiful. How are we supposed to be sad about it? For us, it makes the building prettier, I'm not lying. That's why we do it, because we think it's really beautiful. If I paint a building, a wall, on the next day it will have "pixo" on it. If I catch who did it, I'll kill him, Am I the criminal, or is it him? No, it's not art. It's a dirty work, it's a prank, and a shameful thing. They should be arrested and thrown in jail. This is a crime. INAUGURATION OF THE 28TH BIENAL OF ARTS OF SAO PAULO They're individuals that, as many Brazilians, suffer from the invisible's syndrome. What make them tag is the desire to say: "I exist, I'm here, I want people to look at me, I want to contribute.". So, their existence won't be null. The "pixo" in São Paulo is more interesting than graffiti. What I see, I find very kistch, the kind of cheesy art, I find it very cheesy. And I think the "pixo" has the advantage of being everything, except cheesy. As we were inspired by the wild style, of the 80s in Europe to create a style, now we can search for a style in Brazil. There are so many great things in the world that aren't art. I don't know why everybody thinks that any expressive experience must be entitled as art. It's the quickest, fastest method that I've ever seen. - Tremendous artist! - Go to jail! If "pixo" wants to become a piece of art, soon enough it will be decorating rich ladies'houses. They will call them, pay them, and beg them to tag their apartments, tag their Nike stores and stuff like that, do "pixo" in Ellus, - I am a "pixadora". - Long live freedom! - Long live "pixo"! - Let her go, man. - Let her go, man. "São Paulo, the biggest city of the south hemisphere, gave birth to an unique form of expression. It's not graffiti, it's "pixo". SAO PAULO, APRIL 18TH, 2008. CORNER OF SAO JOAO'S AND DUQUE DE CAXIAS'S AVENUE. There was nobody on the street and they scared us bad. They pulled guns out, put it on our heads, It's beyond wild, it's a whole new thing. It has no reference, It didn't have any reference to anything that I could even, remotely, access, you know. My hair was standing up on the edge of my arms. I had goose bumps, I was completely blown away. There was so much graffiti there. To use a building as a book, as a surface, as media, in my opinion is a very sophisticated concept. It completely strangled the city. It completely took over every part of the city that was available, and like any surface that was available. Not trendy, not copied from a magazine, just very roots, you know. And I think graffiti culture in the rest of the world has become quite trendy.
