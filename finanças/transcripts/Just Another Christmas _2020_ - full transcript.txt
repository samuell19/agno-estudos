When people ask me why I don't like Christmas, the answer is plain and simple: I was born on Christmas Day. My mom always said I was her best Christmas present. It was a cute thing to say. My dad said he would rather have a set of boxers. I think he was joking. Everyone born on Christmas Day knows it, we never get a decent birthday party. Right? That is, when we get to have one. Your school friends are away enjoying the holidays with their families, opening their presents. Eventually, I stopped celebrating it. I wouldn't ask for parties anymore. I couldn't compete with a more famous, beloved, and charismatic birthday buddy. Then I would just travel on that date. I would go out with friends that also hated Christmas, get drunk, and sleep around. It was just another regular holiday. That is, until I met Laura… married her, and had babies with her. Everything changes when you have kids. You can't ignore Christmas because your kids certainly won't. Thank God it only happens once a year. Oh my God! Dear God! Jesus Christ! Yay! Let's go! BUY MOM'S PRESENT BUY LEOZINHO'S PRESENT THANK YOU HAPPY HOLIDAYS MERRY CHRISTMAS 2010 DONATE TO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD CLUB What's up, my man? How are you? -I've got a special deal here… -No, thanks. -What about your kids? -No. I'd rather boil in here! Be careful, man! Damn! I can see you cutting the line, honey! And you just pretend you're not there. In front of everyone! Hey, you're pushing me! You know what? I'm leaving! Excuse me! You don't… Seriously, get out of my way! Oh my God! -Jeez. -Are you crazy? So… One is for my mother-in-law, one is for my mom, one is for my uncle, and one for myself. My family loves panettone. Huh? Fuck. Is it playing? YOUR DONATION IS VERY IMPORTANT MAKE A CHILD SMILE Mom, listen to me, okay? I made the rice. Uncle Victor's bringing the turkey, Luana's bringing apple turnovers. Soraia's bringing chicken salad, I've got the ham here. Just bring the potato salad. Tell her "no apples". I don't like it. Mom, no apples… Too late. -Goddammit! Why? -Okay, Mom. We'll be waiting for you. Bye, bye. Seriously, I think your mom does it on purpose. She knows I hate apples in potato salad, raisins in the rice, prunes in the turkey. Why mix sweet and savory? It doesn't make sense. It's scary. You bite thinking it's a slice of a cucumber and it's dessert. People must have the munchies, they don't even peel the potatoes. Stop whining, Jorge! Go and wrap Leozinho's bike. What for? It's a present. It has to be a surprise. Honestly, you do know that Leozinho's asked us for a bike? He knows he's getting one. He even chose what color it is. If I wrap it, what will it look like? Like a bike, not an elephant. It makes no sense. Let's just put a bow on it. -There it is. "Yay, a bike!" -And the spirit? What about the Christmas spirit? We even have a Santa coming. Luana's boyfriend will be Santa. Leozinho doesn't believe in Santa. I told him, -"It's just capitalism!" -That was awful. But Aninha still believes in Santa. And so do our nieces. And I like it. -Fine. I'll just grab a beer first-- -No, let me do it! Why do we have a cake? My birthday is tomorrow. I know, Jorge, but everyone will be here at midnight. It's an important day. The kids loved the idea. Why? Everyone celebrates birthdays. Because they love you. And I do too, silly. Do you? Do you think it's a bike? I don't know. It could be anything. I'm scared. French toast! That's my boy! Beatriz, don't touch your cousin's present! -Honeybun… -Come on, Dad! Why do we need another deer? -Why not just me? -You started it. Roy doesn't want to play. Go. I'll take one for the team. -Go! -You're heavy now, honey. -My turn! -Go away! Are you crazy? You're too big. That's enough, honey. My back is killing me. -Ouch! -Can we watch Shrek the Halls? Another time. I promise you we will, but not now. Jeez! My back. -Ouch. -Mom! Yay, your mom! -My baby girl! -Merry Christmas! -Welcome! -Thank you. -Kids! Merry Christmas! -Merry Christmas! -All the kids are here! -Let's go inside. -Thank you for the hug. -Careful, it's hot. Put it on the table there. It's burning! Ouch! -Let's go! -Come… Merry Christmas, Dad. Hey, Dad. Merry Christmas! What about dessert? -Luana's bringing apple turnovers. -Wait a minute! Will she be rolling it down a hill? I had never heard that one before! Grandma! Aninha, you've grown up so much. Juliana, Bia, you only get presents if you eat your salad. Exactly. Eat the salad. You too. You're on a diet. My diet starts after New Year's. Same. I'll quit smoking next year. I didn't get the cashew nuts. They keep getting more and more expensive. Grandma, what do you want for Christmas? All I need is health, sweetie! If you say so. -Hey, Jorge! -Jesus! Do you think this government will last? Is the Roberto Carlos show on already? Probably. Hurry up, check for yourself. What a pain! Another Christmas, my brolaw! -"My brolaw"? -Short for brother-in-law. Come on. -Can I have one? -Have mine. I don't want it anymore. Your puns are as good as Uncle Victor's. Let's pray for a better year. Let me tell you, this one's been rough. -No need. -But look. I have an amazing business idea for next year. It's a big deal, man. I will make a lot of money. In the jewelry industry. -Smuggling it? -No! -Because last time… -No. I've learned my lesson. I'll be making jewelry. Did you know that when you polish a gold ring or necklace on that little desk, the goldsmith keeps all that dust? -Interesting. -I know, right? At the end of the month, I'll have gold dust on top of my pay. I'll be rich! We'll be rich, my brolaw! Well, it's about damn time. Yes, but listen… You know, times have been rough… -I have two kids and… -Right. How much? -Do you think I would ask you for money? -How much? Whatever you can, what fits your budget. Don't forget it's Christmas. -I'll write another check. -Thanks. That's your great-grandfather, Nhanhão. And that is me. Wow! Is that really you? Oh my God. Wow, was he alive once? -Stop it, Bia. He's still alive. -Exactly. It doesn't look like it, but he is. Grandpa Nhanhão had a stroke. What's "a stroke"? It doesn't matter. He was the best dad in the world. He worked as Santa for many stores every Christmas. Look! -He really looks like Santa. -He does. The most beautiful one. He loved dressing up, playing with kids, giving them presents. He couldn't wait for Christmastime. It was his favorite time of the year. Some kids… really thought he was Santa. I miss my dad here… closer to me. He's here, Mom. -More aware than we think. -Right. Listen, Teodora, feel free to take your dad to spend some time with you. Really. Not a problem at all. Are you off, Uncle Victor? He can go to yours as well, since you're a bachelor. I'm a widow, Jorge. I have labyrinthitis. I can't look after him by myself. No! I just mentioned it because you looked very touched just now. I thought it would do you good to spend time with him, maybe a month. You and Laura kept the family house. Are you changing the deal? -No-- -Baby, it's not the time for this. -Why not? -Because it's Christmas! I know. And it's the right time to share. So let's share Grandpa Nhanhão. He can stay at Luiz Cláudio's on some holidays. He doesn't do much anyway. Dad, Grandpa's on the phone! Thank God! We'll talk about that later. -We have nothing to talk about! -Dinner time! Merry Christmas to you as well, old man. It's okay, Dad. I understand. It is what it is. You can come next time. Yes, we got the presents. The kids are fine. I miss you too. I promise I'll try to come and visit you next year. Uncle Victor and Soraia are fighting! Fuck. Merry Christmas, Dad. I'll speak to you on New Year's. I won't have you disrespect me! I demand respect as well! Guys, it's Christmas! -Screw it! -That's uncalled for! What happened here, guys? -He keeps going on about my cleavage. -What's wrong with it? -He said it's whore-like. -And it is! You're senile! You can't say that in front a senile person. It will make it even worse! Jorge! -Yes? -Am I senile, then? Not literally senile. It's more like, "There he goes." "What a happy, nice senile man!" That's it. I had enough! You don't deserve my company! Nor my turkey! -No, Uncle Victor! -Look! -What's that? -I'm done! -Jorge, go after him! -Now you want me to get the turkey? Hold on, Uncle Victor! -It touched his armpit, guys! -You're beautiful. -Let me be! Bring that back! -Jeez. The apple turnovers have arrived! Where's Joca? -Don't ask, we broke up. -What? -News flash! -Give me a break, Mom! -You don't settle with anyone. -Why did you break up? He gave me cheap jewelry for Christmas. -Is that the only reason? -Sis! Let me break it down for you. You must be a bit confused. It's Christmas. I'm young, I'm hot. And he has money. Baby Jesus was born, it's Christmas. -Where is my present? -She's right about that. -Mom, can you smoke outside? -The kids aren't here. Besides, I found out he was fat. Really? He weighs 264 lbs and you just found that out today? Better late than never. For God's sake, Luana! He was our Santa! Where am I going to find another one now? That turkey is a no for us! That's all water under the bridge. It was horrendous. Such a pitiful thing to see. He started running, tripped, and dropped the turkey. It was a nice scene. It was all in slow-motion. He fell over, and it started rolling. I managed to grab the turkey, but it was buttered up so it kept bouncing from my hands, I couldn't get a hold of it. Then he threw it inside the trunk. It made me puke in my mouth, because it felt like he would still eat it later, sadly. It's never too late to make spaghetti with hot dogs. With tomato sauce. Kids love it. Grate some cheese on it, right? Shall we…? What is it? Laura, I don't want to do this! Jorge, I can accept not having turkey or my uncle on Christmas, but not Santa. You just need to go on the roof and pretend you're bringing presents that will fall over there, next to the tree. Got it? You need more filling. Why? I look fat enough. I already have the bag… Jesus Christ! Did you put an elf in here? What's in it? Stones? Children? Leozinho? What an absolutely useless day! Useless! Hey, old-timer, very old guy? It should be you here. Not me, you. It should be you. You already have the beard, the looks… I don't even like Christmas and have to do this! You will find out what Christmas is good for. Laura! -Come here! -What is it, Jorge? The dying one! -The moribund… -What? Someone jump-started him and he just moved! That's impossible, Jorge. He hasn't spoken or moved in years. He spoke to me! -He did! -Fine. Let's go now, then. -Get your bag. -Baby… What are you talking about? Believe me! -Yeah, sure. -Talk to her! -It's your granddaughter! -Leave him alone. Sorry, Grandpa. Let's go. -It's time. -No, but he-- Say something to her, for God's sake! Come on. He spoke to me, Laura. He moved. He pointed at me. If you need anything, talk to me through this. Testing. Why does Santa have a walkie-talkie? Am I talking to the elves? Good idea. Don't even. You're getting the spirit. -No, I'm not. -It'll be great. Go on. It'll be great. They're waiting. You look crazy. Do you know that? Like a psychopath. -Go on, Jorge! -Okay, I'm going. -Careful. Give me a kiss. -Okay. Guys, I have an announcement! I have a special surprise for you this year. We will see Santa up there! Are you guys ready? -Yes! -Yes! Get the plugs. The magic is about to happen! And listen up, Christmas is about to happen! One, two, three… now! Wow! Now let's all close our eyes. Everyone with your eyes closed and wishing with all your hearts for Santa to bring presents. Get the music, Luiz Cláudio! Keep your eyes closed! You can come, Jorge. Come. Yes, turn it on. He's almost here! Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! -Merry Christmas! -Merry Christmas! Look at what I have here! How wonderful! Dear Lord! Who wants presents? -Me! -Me! Me! Then I'm going down the chimney -to put… -No need, Jorge. Get back up. No need. Get back up. Get back up, Jorge! No need to do that. Get back up. Get back up, Jorge. No need to do that, Jorge. No need. Ouch… -Wake up, Dad! -Oh, baby girl… Let me sleep some more. I'm really tired. Can we watch Shrek the Halls? We can watch it later, okay? Let me sleep some more, I'm tired. Will Santa bring me my bike? You asked him for a doll. No, I asked for a bike. Your brother asked for a bike, you wanted a doll. No, I asked for a bike. Okay, baby. Go talk about it with your mom and let me sleep, I'm tired. Mom, I don't want a doll! Huh? Laura, where is my blue toothbrush? I don't know, Jorge! Yours is the red one! But… Oh, whatever. BUY LUANA'S PRESENT BUY UNCLE VICTOR'S PRESENT Leozinho. -Did you grow since yesterday? -I don't know, Dad. Where'd you get that skateboard? You know I don't like it. It's dangerous. You can really hurt yourself. It's awful! You gave it to me for my birthday. Don't you remember? Me? The old man's gone crazy. Hi, baby. Hi, baby. -What are you making? -Your cake. I couldn't find a decent one, so I decided to bake it myself. Why don't we eat the one in the fridge? Huh? Here is what to buy for Christmas dinner. Another Christmas dinner? What about yesterday's leftovers? What? We had pizza yesterday. Have some coffee to wake up. Okay. -Hi, Mr. Jorge. Merry Christmas. -There's nothing merry about it! Nothing. Someone stole my car. And parked another one in my spot. Will you check the security camera to find the asshole that stole my car? And also the asshole who parked in my spot? Please. Mr. Jorge, take a deep breath. Calm down. Your car is right over there. You're so funny. Are you a comedian? -Stand-up comedian. -That's not my car. I know my own car. If it was mine, I would press this little button… and it would-- Someone has been drinking… So there's no respect anymore? Is that how it is going to be now? Is this Freaky Friday? Speaking of which, I'm getting Christmas tips from everyone who hasn't contributed yet. Christmas tips. People usually give around R$ 300, but you do what's best for you. Wow! You're doing better than me. The tips are paying off! Don't lie to me. I already gave you money. Let's not argue, Mr. Jorge. You already paid me, yes, but that was last year. For God's sake, man! What are you talking about? Do you think I'm stupid? I gave you that yester… MERRY CHRISTMAS 2011 DONATE TO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD CLUB Mr. Jorge! Hey! He forgot about giving me money. -Laura! -You scared me, Jorge. What's up? What day is today? -December 24th. -No way! That was yesterday! Today is the 25th. Excuse me? It's all because of that stupid 2011 banner that's outside. I know people start selling panettones in August, but this is too much now! To put a 2011 banner up! We just finished 2010's celebrations! This is absurd! There's nothing wrong with it, Jorge. Today is December 24th, 2011. DECEMBER 2011 Jorge? What's up, Jorge? What's wrong? It's 2011, Jorge. Oh my God… Our vacation at Ricardo and Priscila's in Angra, remember? No. Aninha's ballet presentation in September. -You took this, remember? -Nothing. New Year's Eve in Búzios, at Pousada do Sol with my sister. Your head was healed here, remember? I remember last Christmas like it was yesterday. Uncle Victor grabbing the turkey and leaving, your brother asking me for money, your sister's break-up, me dressing as Santa and falling off the roof… What happened after that? The entire year happened. And why can't I remember any of it? I don't know. It must be a trauma. Selective memory, maybe. -You need to see a doctor. -How? I don't even know what it is. And it's Christmas again! How will I even get an appointment? What an ugly painting. You bought it yourself. Me? That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard. Just think about it, Laurita. If I lost my memory when I hit my head, we just need to do it again and I'll recover it. -Did you learn that on TV? -Yes. -What will you tell them? -What do you think? That their father needs to get hit on the head. They will love it. It will be like a game. No children would like this. -Of course they would! -Can I do it, Dad? -No, me first! -See? There's plenty for everyone. No, there isn't! You're not hitting your dad! This is ridiculous! Come on, Mom. It's fun! They want to help their dad. Of course not! They want to beat you up! You shouldn't be doing that on Christmas! Actually, that's true love. All right? That's so cool! Can we hit you now, Uncle? Wait, that's too much love. Who invited them? We did. They have a baseball bat, Dad. -Damn… -Why are you wearing a helmet? It will spoil the fun. For protection. I'm scared. Got it? Ouch! Shit! Not on my ass! That's not allowed. -That wasn't the deal-- -Yes, it was! -Oh my God! -Dad! Okay, that's it! That's enough! -It's war! -No! What's happening? -Did I vote for this lunatic? -You did, Jorge. I wouldn't vote for a jerk like that. Don't you lie to me, Laurita. I'm telling you that you did. You even campaigned for him. -Why didn't I vote for--? -A scandal made you change your mind. You switched sides. Let's change the subject. Okay, let's. Politics, done. Now, family. -How are the kids doing at school? -As usual. They are taking the regular classes, they're healthy, and growing up. Aninha passed, Leozinho didn't. Leozinho flunked? It happens. And got a skateboard? We're too soft. That's unacceptable. I study with him every day. You used to. After your promotion, you don't have time for anything. Did I get a promotion? -Really? Am I a manager? -Yes. You bring a lot of work home. Barely have time for us. I got a raise! It was a great year then! Hence the new car. Yeah! I can't wait to see my paycheck. Do you know if Maércio was fired? He's a thief. Of course, I don't know, Jorge. He probably was. Suck it, Maércio! -Jorge! -Yes? -We were talking about Leozinho. -Of course! Let's hire a tutor. We have the money for it. -I'm gonna talk to him about it. -No. Don't say anything. Not until you remember things. I don't want them to think you are… A manager. -Crazy, Jorge. -Fair enough. Are you done? I must carry on, there's no maid today. Yeah, I'm done. We have a maid? Do you think it's a bike? -Maybe! -I'm scared. -Here it is. -That's my boy! Beatriz, don't touch your cousin's present! What's up, Jorge? I hate Christmas. It's the second in a row for me. It's all the same. Baby, please relax. Aninha, what's this? A game, Dad. Who gave you that? You did, for Children's Day. Keep it together, Jorge. -Merry Christmas, guys! -My darling! -Hi, Mom! -Hi, Laurinha! -Grandma! -Merry Christmas! You all are so beautiful! Careful, it's a little hot. -Shit, I forgot. -Put it over there. Ouch! Merry Christmas, Dad. Hey, Dad. Merry Christmas! -What about dessert? -Luana's bringing apple turnovers. Wait a minute. Will she be rolling it down a hill? -Grandma! -Wow, Aninha! You've grown so much! Juliana, Bia, you only get presents if you eat your salad. -Exactly. Eat the salad. -You too. -You're on a diet. -My diet starts after New Year's. I'll quit smoking next year. I didn't get the cashew nuts. They keep getting more and more expensive. Grandma, what do you want for Christmas? -Health. -Health. I can go after the other stuff myself. -Hey, Jorge! -Jesus! Do you think this government will last? -Guys! -Holy crap! -Is the Roberto Carlos--? -It's on already. -Great. -Roberto… -What's up, my brolaw! -You scared the shit out of me! -This shitty nickname stuck. -The year went by so quick. -I didn't even see it. -Me neither. Let's pray for a better year. Always short of money. -Tell me about it. -But you're doing well. I heard today that you had a promotion. Yeah, me too. -Excuse me? -Tell you what, let's do this. Let's cut to the chase. Let me tell you my idea first. -No need. -I'm growing shiitake mushrooms. My God… You just need to put seeds inside a log, water it thrice a day, shake it really well, and it will grow like crazy! That's it! I'm going to be rich, my brolaw! I have two sure customers. Two? I'm worried you might not be able to handle it. -How much? -What? -Do you think I want your money? -How much? However much you can afford. Turn around, it's wet there. -That's it. -I will pay it back with interest. -Sure, of course. -Don't forget it's Christmas. As if I could. I know you can't come, Dad. You told me yesterday-- Last year. I had a couple of drinks, so I'm a bit tipsy. I miss you too. We haven't seen each other this year? I must really be working a lot. It's fine, Dad. I promise I'll come see you on vacation time. I love you too, bye. Is everything okay, Jorge? Yes, Teodora. I just need a drag now. Since when do you smoke? I really don't know. Laura did say that you've been secretly smoking. Really? -How come she didn't say anything? -Does she have to? Don't you know what you do? I do. Of course I do. It's just… I really do need another drag. -Jorge! -Quit smoking! -That will kill you! -Jorge, Uncle Victor… Is trying to grab the turkey and leave. Why can't he bring the chicken salad? -We can deal with it later. -You have to stop smoking! -Do something, Jorge. -I will. -You're such a sexist prick! -Agreed. I won't stay! Jesus. What's going on here now? Victor, give us a break. Again with this? We didn't have turkey yesterday. Are you doing that again? We didn't have it either. Christmas is today. Let's not argue today. He's offending me, Laura. He said that I sleep around. That's so rude, Uncle Victor. Joca's been around for years. You lost some weight, well done. I was worried about your health. -What do you mean? -Joca was from last year. That's Marcão. -Remember? -My bad. But it's a high turnover. -It's hard to keep track. -See? I told you! Am I wrong, then? You owe me an apology. -I owe nothing to anyone. -Apologize to him! I'm not talking to you, Jorge. -We don't need to talk. -You know what? You don't deserve my company! -Here we go… -Nor my turkey! -For God's sake! -Enough! Come on, not today. For God's sake! You guys deal with it. I honestly don't have… Honey… I can't take another Christmas with your family. It was just a bad day. Two days in a row for me. I'm sure you'll remember it all next year. Just relax. Don't forget that there's a whole year until next Christmas. I hope so. -Good night. -Good night. MERRY CHRISTMAS 2012 DONATE TO OUR… No! -Laura. -Yes? -It happened again. -Oh no! -Where are the kids? -At my mom's. See if you can remember anything. We can't wait. I need to see a doctor. A doctor, Jorge? You've done a million tests. -And nothing showed up? -No, everything's perfect. And on the 25th you remembered everything except the 24th. And what did the doctor say? He just told you to rest and to wait until Christmas Day again, today. You really don't remember anything? Nothing, baby. All I remember is last Christmas. Someone's cursed me or something… -It was him! -What? He said I'd find out what Christmas is good for. You did this, didn't you, old man? You cursed me! That's impossible. He hasn't spoken in years. He spoke to me two days ago! You better lift this curse! Lift it! Let go of him, Jorge. I'm so sorry, Grandpa. He's just a bit stressed. What now? -Merry Christmas, Mr. Jorge. -Go to hell! -Who was that? -Oswaldinho asking for money! -It's the same thing every year! -It's not that. I asked a favor of him. -What did you ask? -To bring your birthday cake. Whoops. Happy birthday, Mr. Jorge. Oswaldinho, I didn't recognize you. You dyed your hair. You lost an eye. Here. Should we give him a Christmas tip? -I already gave it to him. -She did. Would you like some coffee to go with the cake? -I'll have one with no sugar. -Bring him coffee with no sugar. Let's just sort this out here… We'll fix it. Let's-- It's great. Do you want a mustache or a goatee? -I prefer a mustache. -It looks great. Don't lick it. A bit of puke. I'll get you-- Potato salad. The turkey is hot. -Grandma! -Grandma! All the kids are here! -What about dessert? -Luana's bringing apple turnovers. Wait a minute. Will she be rolling it down a hill? -What's that? -Careful there! The tree almost fell. This is how this pyramid works. You will go to Heaven and be so rich. You don't deserve my company! Nor my turkey! -No! -It's mine! Get away from me! -It's mine! -Go after him! -Give it to me! -Someone get him! SLEEPNAX Jorge. Jorge? WAKE ME UP TOMORROW I LOVE YOU Jesus, Laura, you scared me! -How long are you gonna hide? -How long? Let me check what day today is just to be on the safe side. It's Christmas Day! Another Christmas Day, right? Another one with your family moaning, eating panettone, raisins, and hearing about a year that I don't even remember. -Jorge-- -Let me ask you something. What year is this? 2030? 2040? -2021. -I was so close. It doesn't matter anyway, I wouldn't have remembered it. At this time of the year, I'm the crazy uncle. By the way, did I find the cure? -You gave up four years ago. -Good night, then. -See? -Jorge! We miss you, dammit. -It's a day like any other day. -No, it's Christmas. We want you with us. Even Uncle Victor asks about you every year. -Does he still take the turkey? -Every year. I always have a backup. You're the best. I know you have my best interest in mind, but I'll stay in bed today. Mom? Hi, guys. Come on in. -Good morning! -Good morning, guys. Honey. You're so grown up and beautiful. -How are you, Dad? -I'm fine. It's good to see you awake, old man. "Old man"? You forgot… Do you need anything from the grocery store? Yeah. There's a list on the fridge. -Can you drive me to Nanda's? -Of course. -Put in a good word for me. -Get a haircut and I will. "Old man", Laura? Do I let Leo use my car, Laurita? No, he's got his own. -Who gave it to him? -You did. When he got into college. Engineering school. Things are looking better. -What's that? -What? -This shit on my face. -It's your mustache. I look like Mario Bros. Don't tell me I have a mustache. It's on your face. -I hate mustaches. -Me too! -Why didn't you make me shave it? -I tried. We're getting rid of it now. Jesus! You have to promise to never let me grow a mustache again. I swear I try to, but you just love it. How can someone like something like that? People change. Tell me about it. I can feel I got old. My skin is thinning. -You're getting more mature. -It has no glow. Look at the wrinkles. I'll put some botox here, some on the sides here. Jorge, you've done that already. Really? Well, that's something. I'm gonna take a shower, then-- I have something important to tell you. Jorge-- Let me just take a shower first. Now, I'll-- That's what I was gonna say. I wake up and find out I had a bypass. Two, actually. Nice. Should I be drinking this? Yes, it's decaf. Great stuff. How did I end up like this? In short: too much work and stress, no exercise, and the horrible habit of smoking behind my back. But, baby… And do I still have all my other organs? -Kidneys, liver? Am I in one piece? -Yes. Minus a testicle. Oh my God… Hold on. You can't say that, I had a bypass. I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. -Hi, Dad. -You look nice. Nice to meet you. -No, you've met him. -Okay. That's Grandpa Nhanhão. -Hi, son. It's a pleasure. -You've met her. Okay. -I'm so impressed. -They've grown up, haven't they? -No, Grandpa Nhanhão is alive. -Jorge… He's immortal. He made a deal with the devil. Don't take a photo because the spirit will show up. -Trust me. -Come on. Did you stick a sword in a stone or something? Like King Arthur, and say: "I shall die the day someone pulls it out." Let's find that sword and get it over with. Mom's here. -Welcome. -Merry Christmas, Laurinha. -Baby girl. -Mom. Look who's here this year! What a surprise! -Are you okay, Jorge? -Yes, Teodora. You? Laura told me about your condition. Oh, she did, did she? That's cute! Everyone knows. That's great, wonderful. -Shall we, Mom? -Uncle Victor, what's on the menu today? They wouldn't let me bring the turkey. Really? I wonder why that is. I brought the apple turnovers. Did you roll it down a hill? You woke up this year to say that dumb thing? -Jeez. -How rude! What's up, my brolaw? -I have a business idea for us. -Nice. Just before you say anything, don't bother asking me for money. I don't even know how much I have. Are you crazy, Jorge? I never asked you for money. -Ever. -What? Laura said you have some sort of amnesia. I just wanted to say I've never asked you for absolutely nothing. Literally. Zilch, zero. On the contrary, I'm here because… you owe me money. Let me tell you something before I end up punching you. Here's the thing: I'm not an idiot, I just have amnesia. I don't remember things throughout the year, except for Christmas Days. I remember every single Christmas Day. Got it? Gotcha! How do you know I owe you money if you don't remember anything this past year? Trust me, I paid you in July. -You just made that up. -I paid you. -I paid you in July. -Are you trying to hypnotize me? -I didn't ask for money. -You don't pay. -Your phone's ringing. -Listen to this. -Your uncle's trying to hypnotize me. -Pick it up, it could be important. It's your secretary, Márcia. -It might be a Merry Christmas call. -I didn't know I had one. -I don't even know what to say. -Look. Pick up. Mom doesn't like her very much. -Got it? -Okay. Gotcha. Hi. Merry Christmas, Márcia. Go to hell, asshole! What? I think there's been a misunderstanding. Only because I believed you! -Are you okay, baby? -Yes, baby. "Baby"? Do you still call her that? Jorge, this is… You promised to spend today with me! Márcia, I can't really talk now… -I think that the government will last. -…or ever. It's not a good day for me… It's about to get worse. If you don't come meet me now at the diner next to the office, I'm gonna come over there and make a scene in front of your family! Let me tell you something… -What's that? -Your birthday cake. -Do you like it? -Cake? Of course I do. But where's the cherry? There's no cherry. It's strawberry. That's crazy. Cherries are a must. I'll go buy some. What are you doing? -I'll buy some cherries. -You don't even like them. I haven't had one in ten years. Maybe I do now. Be right back. -I'll get some cherries. -Right now? -Jorge? -I'm going buy cherries. -Wait up! -Jorge! It will be quick. I just wanted to wish you a merry Christmas, Mr. Jorge. And I'm also getting this year's Christmas tips. May karma come around for you. Act natural. Act natural! I don't want anyone seeing us here. Firstly, you have to know that I love my family. Whatever I told you, or promised you, please forget it. End of discussion, okay? You're very attractive. I did a little scan when I came in and you're definitely my type. -Are you crazy? -Yes, this is all crazy! It might sound crazy, honestly, and I know it's painful, but we can't see each other anymore. That's the deal. We can't see each other anymore. -I know it hurts-- -Joana, who's this guy? Joana who? How are you? It's hot in here, isn't it? Are you ill? Let me tell you something with all due-- I'd say you're over 100.4 °F. I can respectfully explain it to you. I thought she was-- With all due respect, I thought she was my-- Your what, idiot? -Jorge! -My-- Jorge! She's over there! I got confused. I'm sorry. I can't really see without my glasses. Hello, nice to meet you. You must be Márcia. Is that really what you're coming up with? Well, since we know each other, I must have told you about my amnesia. Did I tell you about that? Selective amnesia, really? Are you serious? Do you take me for a fool? -Everyone's looking. -Listen… I know you shaved your mustache just to make a statement. I did it because it was horrendous. You grew it for me! -I liked it! -Wait a minute. Please, try to understand. I don't even know who you are! I'm not the Jorge you think I am. I'm another Jorge, from years ago. This Jorge you know does not exist. You're a very interesting woman. You need someone better. For God's sake! -Muffin… -"Muffin"? You're not going to waste our four years together. -Four years? -The ring-- This one. You gave it to me. Remember? Please, pay attention. I will only say this once. What's up? I don't know who you are! I swear I have no idea what you're talking about! Please believe me! And can I ask you something? If I come after you in a few days, even if I'm on my knees, please promise me you won't take me back. I'm not that Jorge! This is not who I am! Believe me! You're insane. It's the only explanation. You don't know what you want. -Yes, I do. -You don't. -I do. -Right. I love my wife, and I want to be with her! I want my family. I love those guys even more! I never want to grow a mustache again! I thought you were different. You're more senile than ever! You don't deserve my company! -Nor my apple turnovers! -No way! -The apple turnovers are mine! -No! -Go after him! -Get him! Get him, Mom. Laura… How are things between us? What kind of question is that? It's just… that it's Christmas, time for us to think about our lives and people around us. -You didn't say anything about us. -Maybe I don't want to. You don't remember anything anyway. There's no point. So why did you wake me up this year? Do you really want to know? Really, baby. I love looking at you now and seeing Jorge from ten years ago. I love the way you still look at me. I even miss you calling me "Laurita", something I used to hate. You know, Jorge, at Christmas, you remind me of how we used to be. Or, at least, what I meant to you. Good night. I forgot the lyrics Do you like your surprise, Muffin? What am I doing here? God, Jorge. So it's really true? You don't remember anything? What am I doing here? I can't believe it. You left Laura. Oh my God! The divorce papers are coming and we've been living here for four months! No! That's not true. It's just a nightmare! -Nightmare… -No. It's not. Let's sit down. -Sit here with your mommy. -I don't want to. -Mommy's cutie pie! -Mommy, my ass! -I don't even want to look at you! -Oh, you are! -Jesus. -Hey. Listen up. I know that the Christmas season messes with people's little heads. People go a bit crazy. No! Let me go! Listen, I'm in charge of my life! I'm in charge of my story! And, in this story, you're not my wife! I want my beloved wife back! Why the hell is this monstrosity on my face again? -I'm shaving it off now. -No! -Stop it! -No! -You're not touching the mustache! -But I will! I will! You made me promise you I wouldn't let you shave it off! I take krav maga classes, it's self-defense! It was a dirty move to throw my razor through the window. I just did what you asked me to do. Or at least half of it. Keys. Baby, what do you say we spend Christmas Day here at home? I've put up an amazing tree. And baked a stunning cake. It's low-calorie. That tree is shit, you bought the cake, and don't call me baby. -Give me the keys. -Jorge. We need to talk. I don't want to talk to you. Fine, don't listen to me. Just listen to someone else. Yourself. Jorge? Hey, Jorge. Hello. I know I must look a bit odd, like a different person. But I'm actually you tomorrow. And the day after as well. I'm you throughout the year. Is that asshole me? So charming! I am the normal… and spontaneous you. I'll have you know, Jorge, that I love Márcia. You love Márcia. You have a type of schizophren… "Schizophrenia", really? Whatever. You have a type of Christmassy "schizophronia", "schizophrony…" You go a bit loony on Christmas Day. You have no idea how amazing you are. A wonderful, fantastic, sexy, hot, and very manly man, I might add. Honestly, a real catch. Wow, I'm really humble. Yeah, you're a bit self-absorbed. This is why, Jorge, or myself, on Márcia's orders… I mean, the doctor's, we recorded this video. Movie… Video-- Clip. To show our amazing life next to this incredible person… that is… Márcia. You wrote that, didn't you? -Now. -This is you, Jorge. A fulfilled and happy man. Every morning, you have a healthy breakfast with your stunning girlfriend, Márcia, as previously mentioned a few times already. Why are you feeding me bird food? It's low-calorie. After this healthy meal, your peristaltic movements begin functioning as usual, and you can take good care of your health, my good old Jorge. You even work out your glutes, as your gorgeous girlfriend digs it. "Digs it"? Digs it. After this intensive workout, you get ready to go to work. You know that, for a good businessman, it all starts with your looks. That's you on your way to work. You had a raise this year. Clap, clap, clap. Applause. Well done, Big Jorge. You deserved it. You are a terrific driver. That's you driving to work, so wonderful. Whoops. Eyes on the road, Jorge. Why such a stupid face? What is with this low self-esteem? You love spending time with your family. But you can also have fun. You can be merry sometimes. "Merry" is a bit too much. It's too much. You're an old-fashioned romantic. Sexy, but still looking cool. What a loser. Look at his face. Very much so. Your sex life is wild, Jorge. There's a private party every Thursday. -Did you record us? -Yes. Just watch. Hold on. I wasn't even ready. -Come on, Muffin. -That hurts. -That's so hot. -Ow, my eye. On weekends, you play golf with your friends. A very sophisticated and complex sport. This is your life, Jorge. And to top it all off, I'm great with the camera. I make you look sexy, but not cheap. Your right angle is the best one. Jorge? Jo… Jorge! Ow. -Hey, Dad. Are you okay? -Hi. -All good? -I'm okay. I'm great. I just slipped. Don't do that. -Do you need to borrow clothes? -Yes. I do. Do you need help? I also need a painkiller. Roberto Carlos show, huh? Teodora. Another Christmas together. I hate you! Whoa, what a joy! -Hey, son. -What's up? Are you upset with me as well? Not me, Dad. I'm cool with it. And how's college? Seriously, Dad? You'll forget all about it tomorrow. So what? I'll remember it next Christmas. And I'm your father. Fine, Dad. I dropped out of college. -What? -Yeah, I did. Are you nuts? After all I've done. I don't want to argue. Mom should've told you. -She didn't. -To be honest, I didn't drop out. I was kicked out. -Fuck. -Yeah, I was caught with drugs. -Oh my God, drugs… -Narcotics, yes. -So I decided to give it all up. -Jesus Christ! That's not how we raised you! We already talked about this. I don't remember us talking about this. I did my time. I'm clean now. -You went to prison. -Yes. -Were you someone's bitch? -Let's move on. Forget about the past. -Do you know what my future is? -What is it? -I want to make music again. -Okay, son. I can't believe you did drugs. You had to be the little spoon. But you always liked music. I get all emotional remembering you as a little boy. -I gave you a little piano… -Piano my ass! I'm all about Brazilian funk. -Sorry? -MC Leo. Shaggin' Leo. -"Shaggin' Leo"? -Yes. Listen. Get down, down With your panties all bunched up You can't wait to take it off When I see you get crazy I get crazy hot Crazy hot, crazy hot That's disgusting. What's going on with your voice? -It sounds so weird. -I'm just joking, Dad. What kind of joke is that? I got my diploma a year ago. -I already have a job. -Thank God, son. I thought you were doing drugs. That was killing me. -Sometimes I do a little something. -What little something? What is it? I don't like it. -What's that? -Relax, Dad. It's a joke. I can still disown you. -Relax, Dad. It's Christmas. -Who jokes about drugs? Dad… I'm the least of your problems. Go on. -Laura, can I have a word? -I don't want to talk to you. -I don't even know what I've done. -I'm gonna get the turkey. What do you mean? Isn't Uncle Victor bringing it? Is he in charge of the ham this year? What's wrong? Uncle Victor passed away last month. Nice, Dad. I'd like to make a toast to our beloved Uncle Victor. -The best turkeys we've eaten. -Don't, Dad. I'll stop talking and ask for a moment of silence. What did he die of? Why are you being like this, Laura? It's me. Jorge. -Good Jorge. -Everyone's good at Christmas, Jorge. No, baby. I mean, I'm the real Jorge. No, you're not. The real Jorge dumped me. The real Jorge lives with a trophy wife in a fancy neighborhood. The real Jorge hasn't paid his kids' child support. The real Jorge is a big asshole! -I agree. -I know, and that makes it even worse. I can't even hate you in peace. This is crazy. -I still love you. -This is even crazier. Don't touch me. We're over. I know you still love me. You're wrong. I have moved on. What? -You have already moved on? -"Already"? We split up in February. Oh, you… You're lying. You wouldn't find someone so quickly. Oh, but I did. I really did! I'm going out with a guy from work. Maércio. I knew it. Maércio. He never really got over the fact that I got promoted to manager. That's payback. Jorge. A guy from my work. Do I know him? -It doesn't matter. -Yes, it does. It's a strange man inside our house… -What's up, my brolaw? -Fuck. -Another Christmas-- -Here it is. Laura. -Is he coming? -He must almost be here. Excuse me, Luana. I need to talk to her for a second. -Who is he? -No one. He's just a friend. -Do I know him? -No, you don't. He's a widower, a successful lawyer, he's tall, his hair is more white. He's more mature. More handsome. -Is he coming tonight? -I asked him not to, but I don't know. He might pop by. We'll see. Who knows? Laura's Jorge. I'm Ricardo. Nice to meet you. How are you? Hi, baby. What are you doing, Jorge? Stop chasing other people's wives! Jorge, he's my boyfriend! Another one? -You hurt him! -I got him good! He had a taste of it! That's not my blood. That blood is-- Ow. That's not looking good, Dad. I ruined Christmas Day, didn't I? Relax, Dad. We're used to it. Do you still like that? -Do you remember it? -How could I forget? You've seen it a million times, and always wanted me to watch it with you. "Can we watch Shrek the Halls?" And we never did. Let's be real, I don't know what you saw… in that ugly thing. Well, I thought he looked like you. Damn… Do I look like Shrek? It's not that you look like him, but you do on the second movie when he turns human. Have a look. You had the same hairstyle. Just don't tell your mom that she looked like Fiona. -She won't be happy about it. -I would never. I don't know. It was my way of being closer to you. I love you. I love you very much, Dad. What a day! My family hates me, I lost my house, my daughter thinks I'm an ogre, and the love of my life is with someone else. Dad. Mom's not seeing anyone. -She told me-- -Listen to me, Dad. She went out with this guy a couple of times, but that's it. She's still crazy about you. And I'm crazy about her. You have to do something to change this whole thing. What can I do? I only have one day to fix 364 days of stupid shit I do. What do I do? I don't know, Dad. It's Christmas. Use that in your favor and amaze her. -I love you, son. -Me too. -Behave yourself. -Bye, Dad. -I love you. -I love you too. -Thank you. -Take care of yourself. -Bye, guys. Good night. -Bye, Auntie! Jorge! Laura! Don't give up on us. You do know you won't remember any of this tomorrow, don't you? Better than you will. You wanted to spend Christmas abroad. Did you know that? You were supposed to have woken up in New York today. Far away from your family. You wanted to do that! That's funny. Do you know who wouldn't let you? Me. I said we should stay here. Because I was thinking about you instead of me. I'll do it differently next year. You bet I will. Next year, we're going abroad. We'll wake up far away from here. Really far away, Jorge. Next year, we'll wake up on an island. You wouldn't do that, Márcia. I'll speak to you in a year from now. Márcia. Don't you dare, Márcia! No! No! No! Don't think even for a second I will be stuck here with you, Márcia! I'm going home right now! Nothing will keep me here! Even if I have to hire a plane, a ship, a spaceship, I will spend Christmas Day with the family that I love! My kids, my wife. Yes, I love Laura. She's the love of my life. Don't stop. I was enjoying it. Laura, when did we get back together? Halfway through the year. But I called you every day since January. -Wow! -It wasn't easy. But you were right. I'm loving this. We never spent Christmas away. You had a great idea. It wasn't exactly my idea. You actually paid for this trip to come with Márcia. You wanted to give up on it, but I told you we should come. I like it. We could do this more often. Spend Christmas away, you and me. With the kids sometimes. The kids? Aninha's spending Christmas Day with her boyfriend and Leozinho's gone to Australia. So, why not? We can do it from time to time. I love you. I love you too. So, where would you like to wake up next Christmas? Surprise me. Do you like it? -Take it! -Shopping spree! ANINHA - CHAMONIX, FRANCE HAPPY BIRTHDAY! -Here is good for a photo. -Be careful with the cars. They drive on the other side here. Okay. Careful, Jorge! One, two, three… Hey! -Jorge! -Keep going. It was already broken. SANTA CLAUS' HOME! Laura, take the camera, I want to do a little dance here. -Take it. -Right. Taj Mahal, Taj Mahal You know this is the Kremlin. Same difference, baby. They're castles with domes. HAPPY BIRTHDAY Why didn't we travel this year? Keep your voice down. Sorry. No, I am. I forgot to wake you up. Why are we whispering? Oh my God. -My God… -Did you like the surprise, Dad? That's the best surprise I've ever had, honey. -What's his name? -Victor. -Like our uncle. -No. Like Grandpa Nhanhão. Is Grandpa Nhanhão's name Victor? Grandpa Nhanhão doesn't look like a Victor. This one does. Vitinho. Grandpa looks like an Arnaldo. Mauro. Grandpa Nhanhão's name should've been Mauro… Never mind. So, the father didn't want him? Jorge! He didn't want to get married, it's different. I don't like men that don't care for the family. If he was here, I would talk to him. I'm sure they will figure it out. She's here for now, and you like it. Do I? Do we like it, Roy? Huh, old friend? Speaking of old, how old is he? Not too old. He must be more than 30. He's the Highlander of dogs. Jorge, how can I say this… That Roy. Roy… he's not… How can I say? He's not exactly that other Roy from before. He's a different Roy… but he's also Roy. -He's also Roy. -I mean… Is he Roy II? Roy III. But he's still Roy, the second's puppy. Roy… Let me tell you. My dog has died, and you tried to trick me with another one with the same name and color. That's betrayal. -I'm not even sure I like him. -There's always so much to tell. I ended up forgetting it. I'm sorry. But does it make any difference? It does, it really does. -I liked the first one. -Oh, Jorge… -Does he even like me? -Come on. Is that the same Grandpa Nhanhão? I thought you might be renewing him every decade. You never know. After a while, old people start to all look the same. He could've been embalmed. Did you embalm him? Oh, Jorge… Our neighbors are doing well. That's Uncle Luiz Cláudio. What's up, my brolaw? What is it, Luiz Cláudio? Are you doing Christmas early? No, I'll be spending Christmas Day with my in-laws. I just came to give you a hug. And to drop this off. -There's no need. -Don't even start. It's all here. All that I owe you, plus interest. Honestly, Luiz Cláudio, I never lent you money thinking you'd pay me back. I insist, my brolaw. I got rich! Finally! -How? -It's a wonderful deal! I sell covers for ankle monitors. And does this sell? We're in Brazil, it sells a lot. We're expanding to Latin America, the USA, and then Germany. That's why I need you to take this, from the bottom of my heart. Take it. -Take it, Dad. -I don't even know… -I insist. -Take the money. -I'm not accepting it. -There goes Mr. Jorge! Hey! That's just great. -Merry Christmas, Mr. Jorge. -Merry Christmas. Just in time. Since you're all here, I'm collecting Christmas tips from anyone who hasn't done it yet. What a coincidence. Good timing! You'll be happy today. Excuse me. There you go, Oswaldinho. Enjoy Christmas with your family. Go crazy! Get everyone something. Tell them it was from Uncle Jorge. Mr. Jorge… I know, enjoy it! -Mr. Jorge, thank you so much! -Treat yourself. Thank you. Merry Christmas! Don't mention it. -Merry Christmas! -No worries. -Dad, let me tell you… -Go on. No worries. -So happy! -Merry Christmas, Mr. Jorge! Dad, why did you do that? Learn something from your dad-- No, Dad. I will teach you something I learned from all my years of struggle. -Christmas spirit is essential! -Jorge. We were born with nothing, we die with nothing. -Jorge. -Am I right, Luiz Cláudio? That check was for R$ 1 million! Hold on. Tell me it was in my name. Nope. It was made out to cash. -Oswaldinho! -There he goes. Merry Christmas! -Merry Christmas! -Oswaldinho! -I don't want this shit anymore! -Come back! -Merry Christmas! -Come back! Wait, it was a mistake! Fuck! It was a mistake! -That's for you, honey. -Thank you, Mom. Where's mine? Don't open it, Mom. Come here, baby. Are you serious, Dad? The flu? I've already got the plane ticket. Every year you come up with a new excuse. I know we met last month, but you saw me, I didn't see you. I mean, I saw you, but… You know what I mean. No, I'm not drunk or crazy. I wanted you here this year. Jorge, let's take a group photo. -Let's do it! -Come on! Come on, boys. Later, Dad. I love you. Merry Christmas. -Come on, Dad! -I miss you. -You're family now. -Yay! Come on, let's all gather around. -Come next to your dad. -Come on. Sorry, Dad. I asked them not to tell you. What kind is it? Breast cancer. Just like my mom. Yes. I screwed up, Dad. I took… too long to have it checked. That's why I… I can't breastfeed my son. -I can't do it while being treated. -Baby girl… How are things between us? Me and you? I mean… throughout the year, with the other me, how is it? Do we get along? You know… you used to be very different from the Christmas you. Very. It was very hard for me to get used to it. But not anymore. We do get along. -We do. -Great. We talk every day. You always call to check on me when you travel abroad. I love it. People say that… as we get old, our spirit stays the same. I think that happened to you. He fell asleep. I'm… feeling tired. I think I'll go to bed too. Shall we? No. No. I don't want to fall asleep yet. Sure, Dad. Silly me. What would you like to do? SHREK THE HALLS I'LL UNDERSTAND. LOVE YOU. WITH LOVE, LAURA This one. Come here to Grandpa. Come here. Come here. -Hi, my son. -Hi, Dad. What's up? -He's big, isn't he? -He is. -I love you, Dad. -I love you too. Baby, could you please get the door? Okay. Is this Jorge's house? What a surprise, Dad! C'mon, I'd never miss your birthday! Thank you, Dad. He looks so much like you when you were young. We noticed that too from the photos. I'm so happy you're here. I should've insisted more for you to spend Christmas here. I can't enjoy Christmas without your mom. She used to love it just as much as Laura does. I miss it. I took too many things for granted. I can't even imagine what you've been through. But I am very, very proud of you. Thank you, Dad. I never understood your amnesia. So you don't remember absolutely anything from this year? Nothing, Dad. It feels like it's just been 20 days or so. I don't remember this year at all. I didn't see it go by. To be honest… I didn't see any of my life. I don't have your condition, but I feel the same. It's quite a common feeling to have. Life's like a blow of air. Mr. Pedro, can I borrow you quickly? Go on, Dad. Yeah. I could've done things differently. Then make a wish. What did you just say? I said I could've done things differently, my whole life. Make a wish. What do you mean? Tell me! No, Laura, I don't like this. Please, you guys. -I don't like it. -Jorge. Aninha used to love it. I came to eat cake. -But I don't like it. -Jorge! You can make a wish. He never wishes for anything. But I will now. I want to. I'll wish for something I have never wished for before. Wow. And what's that? He can't tell us, honey, or it won't come true. But it must come from your heart. Dad? Can we watch a movie? Yes, baby. We can watch anything you want. -Leozinho… -Dad! -Merry Christmas! -Merry Christmas, son! Where did all this excitement come from? -It's Christmas! -It's Christmas! Shall we get Leozinho's bike? -Yes! -Let's do it. And who wants to go the supermarket? -Me! -Me! Yeah! And let's buy my birthday cake. -Yes! -Yes! So go and get dressed. Hurry up! I don't want anyone to be late! What's up with you, Jorge? I don't know, Laura. I swear to God, I don't know. I just got this feeling. It feels like I woke up from a dream, looked at you, at our kids, our life, and it made me realize how important all of this is. It's like I'm telling myself that I must fully enjoy this moment right now. I have to, Laura. -Who wants French toast? -Me! When people ask me why I love Christmas so much, I can't really explain why. It looks like Grandpa Nhanhão. It's always hot, rushed, we spend a lot, eat a lot, and everything seems more chaotic and pointless. But many things that may not seem to make sense now… BREAST CANCER AWARENESS …can make sense in the future. The main thing is to be open to life's little hints. Cheer up, guys! Christmas is the perfect time to stop for a while, take a deep breath, and notice that life is more than what happens while we work to pay the bills. Hold tight because we're ready to fly! That life is good. Always. Happy birthday to you To realize this is the biggest present you could ever give yourself. Or do you still believe in Santa? Ho ho ho, Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! He winked! You saw that, didn't you? THE END
