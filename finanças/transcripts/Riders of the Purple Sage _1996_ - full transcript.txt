Alright, get him up. Get him up! 'Deacon.' Deacon Tull, what do you mean by this? I'm sick of seeing this fella Venters hang around you. You want Jane all to yourself, Tull? You'll not be allowed to hold this boy to a friendship that is offensive to your people. Will you have use for M. Withersteen house in Amber Spring and 7,000 herd of cattle? - Oh, Stop it! Stop it! - It's okay. He can have the rest of the world. He can go there. Am I supposed to care for him less because he's not one of us? Your father left you wealth and power. It's gone into your head. If you see the place of women! Venters, will you leave? - No! - Alright. I'll have you whipped and turn you out into sage. And if you ever come back you'll get worse. - No, he won't do that. - By god, Tull. - You better kill me out right. - He's done nothing wrong! No, brother Kart, don't! Tie him to that fence. Don't, please don't. 'Get him up.' 'Tie, him! Tie, him!' I repent my words. Please spare him. Once cometh, my help. - Do you know him, brother Kart? - Nope. Does anyone know him? Evening, ma'am. Jane Withersteen, ma'am? Yes. - The water here is yours? - Yes. May I water my horse. Certainly, there's the trough. Maybe I've kinda hindered something for a few moments, perhaps. Yes. In this country, there are so many rustlers and thieves and cutthroats and gun thrower's and all around no good men. Ma'am, which of the no-good class does this young fellow belong to? He belongs to none of them. He's an honest boy. You know that man? Yes. Then, what's he done to be treated like this. Ask him. Young fella, speak up. Whoa, mister. This is none of your mix. Don't try any interference. Easy, easy. I ain't interferin' yet. I just...stumbled into a queer deal. You eight with guns, a man at the end of his rope and this woman, who swears by his honesty. Queer, ain't that? Queer or not, it's none of your business. Where I was raised, a woman's word was law. I ain't quite out grown that yet. Meddler. We have a law here something different from a woman's whim. Take care, you don't transgress it. To hell with your law. What have you done, to be roped that way? I've been a friend to this woman. Ma'am is it true, what he says? Yes. Young man, seems to me that being a friend to such a woman would be what you wouldn't wanna help and couldn't help. Alright, put Venters over a horse. Let's get out of here, men, c'mon. Stranger? He stays. What? He stays. Mister. We're eight here. Who are you? Lassiter. Oh, man. I'll water her myself. - She's brought you far today. - Yes, ma'am. The men of my creed have been driven and hated until they've become cruel. But we women pray for the time, when their hearts will soften. I'm beggin' your pardon, ma'am. That time will never come. Oh, it will. I heard you'd know where to find the grave of Milly Erne. What do you know of Milly Erne? I've long been looking for her. Nobody knows, but me. Tomorrow, after church.. ...you be here? Thank you, ma'am. C'mon, girl. C'mon. How could he...who told him about Milly? I mustn't stay here tonight, Jane. They'll be back. You give me my rifle. If I'd have had it-- Either you or a deacon of my church would be lying dead. Tull's not gonna leave you alone, till you marry him. 'Pastor Dyer's not gonna stop him.' Bern, who is Lassiter? I heard sort of things. Rumors...from Grays and north of here. He's a gunman, isn't he? Well, I know this. Between Tull and death, there was not the breadth of the littlest hair. Never see you, Jane. Tull keeps you all to himself. No, he's not courting me, brother Brad. What will I do to you. If he does not make haste I'll go on courting myself up to the Withersteen house. Jane Withersteen. I now come to a subject.. ...that is sad for me to speak on. I often wonder.. ...what your father would have said.. ...had he known that at your age you remain unmarried. 'Jane Withersteen, the cross must be fully taken up.' It is time for you to reach deeper into yourself and join your family. 'As is God's will for you to do.' 'Come to your senses woman.' You risk the fires of hell. The eternal damnation of your soul to perdition. Finally.. ...a gunman has come among us. Lassiter. 'An enemy of our people.' 'A killer of innocent men.' There is no place among the righteous for a godless man like him. Let us pray. Deliver me, from mine enemies, oh, my God. Defend me from those who rise up against me. 'Deliver me from the workers of inequity.' 'Save me from the bloody men.' Smite them, Lord. Consume them in wrath. Consume them that they may not be. Amen. Amen. Let us rise and sing now, hymn number 252. "There Is A fountain Filled With Blood." ♪ There is a fountain filled with blood ♪ ♪ Drawn from Immanuel's veins ♪ ♪ And sinners plunged beneath that flood ♪ ♪ Lose all their guilty stains ♪ ♪ And sinners plunged beneath that flood ♪ ♪ Lose all their guilty stains ♪ Anything come off after I left you last night? These people are slow to kill. That's the only good I've ever seen in their religion. 'Hiya, hiya.' C'mon, my boys. Black Star. What do you know about, Milly Erne? Jane spoke of her only once. What did she say? Said she had a little girl. The child was stolen. Why? By who? I don't know. Soon after Milly died by her own hand. Do you know who had Milly brought here? No, I do not. Run, Black Star, Night. Wrangle, get in there. Come. 'Good boy.' What do you think, Lassiter? Never seen their like. Never in my day I've seen a sight of horses. Black Star, Night, fastest riders on the Sage. Well, Wrangle probably has something to say about that. Oh, Bern. Make sure you run them today. Come. East herd's down there.. ...and the west herd is up on the mountain. Hiya. Judkins! Judkins, what is it? - Ah. - Judkins! - 'Judkins.' - Ah. - 'Jane.' - Whoa. Brother Judkins. So, this ain't all blood. - 'What happened?' - Hester. At daylight, this morning Oldring and his rustlers rode down and sloped off with the west herd. - The whole herd? - Yeah. Where are my riders? Ms. Withersteen, I was alone all night with the herd. - You know it was Oldring? - I saw his masked rider. Jane, I-I'll find out where they took that herd. Bern. Ain't nobody tracked Oldring into them canyons and come back to tell about it. Those canyons are a maze, Bern. You'll get lost. - I'm going, Jane. - Bern, Bern. You wanna horse that can run. Yes, which one? Black Star or Night? I'd rather take Wrangle, Jane. He and I get along real good. Wrangle, then. Brother Judkins, what do you think happen to my riders? You can speak, in front of Hester. Your riders were called in. By whom? Tull. He showed up and called them in just before night fall. He didn't give no reason. Just pastor Dyer's orders. Did Deacon Tull say that? Yes, you might say as I ain't goin' who's goin' to hold the herd with me. And nobody stayed. Ms. Withersteen, let me try and get some boys from town. May be some of your riders will come back. 'They didn't know the rustlers were coming.' We'll try and hold east herd, if it's still there. Lassiter. Hiya! C'mon. Hiya, hiya. Hiya. Lassiter! Are you all right? Killed my horse. Here. They're going to ruin you. Just give me Black Star for a spell. Then what? Them fellas won't be stampeding no more cattle. No. No, I won't let you murder them, Lassiter. Appears I'm not going then. I'll get you a horse. Hiya. Oldring. Don't move. Don't you move. Now, don't you move. Pardon, ma'am. With all my life, I've loved to roll stones. Her name's Bells. Bells. Where are your riders? They were called in. By who? You came here to kill a man. They'll break you. The man who brought Milly Erne to Cottonwoods. Who is he? The man who dragged, Milly Erne and her child to hell. Put it that way. Fair thing such as a woman as you'd never dream of. So, don't mention her again. Not till you tell me the name of a man. Never. I reckon, you will. Then I'll never ask ya. I'm a man with strange beliefs in the ways of thinking. 'Cause I seem to see into the future. And I feel things hard to explain. This is a fine horse, Jane. Lassiter, will you be my rider? Did you tell me a name, I reckon? You'll not kill me? No. What's your name? Bess. Don't-don't take me back to cotton woods or glaze. I'll be hanged. No. When you get better, when you're strong enough I'll take you back where they'll find you. Don't. Don't-don't take me there. Just leave me here. Alone? To die? Yes. I will not. I'll find us a place to hide. 'Oh, God.' Show me the way to stay. So, he won't hurt all of my people. Give me the strength. Please don't let it happen again. Let me keep my life out and believe. Please, God. Please. And dear, Lord. Protect my friend, Bern Venters. Mr. Blake, I wondered if you've seen, Brother Judkins? Came through here yesterday, looking for riders. I think he went on the clays. - Morning, Jane. - Pastor Dyer. What happened to my riders? Oh, they've become part of a vigilance band organized to hunt down the man who rustled your cattle. But they were called in before Oldring, Rustled the east heard. - No, no, you're mistaken. - No, I'm not, Pastor Dyer. Brother, Jud.. When the, Rustler's took my herd my riders were already called in. That's not true, dear Jane. You're confused. Miss. Withersteen. Brother Judkins. Brother Judkins? You're riders are staying in, Miss. Withersteen. 'There's a vigilance band organized.' I know, Pastor Dyer, told me. Venters, come back? Head fella, Lassiter, gone? 'I only ask 'coz they say he is the wanted man in the north.' That he killed several men in cold blood. I hired Lassiter. He's with the west herd. You? Oh. Ho-ho. Brother Judkins, I might be lead but I won't be driven. Lassiter, this is an old rider of mine, Judkins. Wishes to speak to you. My name is Judkins. I don't know you. But I know...I heard. What you are. I heard you killed some men in the North. Not just the north. They had it coming, Jane. Well, I've this to say to your face. It would never occur to this woman to suspect me. She couldn't think it might be a low plot to come here and shoot you in the back. Jane Withersteen, hasn't that kind of a mind. Well, I've.. '...I've not come here for that.' I wanna help her to pull up riding alone.. ...with you. Thing is, do you believe me? I reckon, I do. Might've saved yourself some breath. Lassiter, won't you come in, sometimes? Won't you come in and see me oftener? - Is that an order? - Nonsense. I simply asked you to come and see me when you find the time. Why? I've reasons. Only one of what you need to know. If its possible, I want to change you towards my people. And on the moment I can conceive a little I wouldn't - do to gain that end. - I reckon. Will you come? You think it wouldn't be safe you look for an ambush in the cotton woods. Not that so much? Okay? The man get drunk so he locks me up. But I'm not afraid. - Shh. - I'm not afraid. Hush, Bess. - I'm not afraid. - Shh. I'm not afraid. You must be still, must be still. Don't-don't. Don't-dont talk. Don't die, Bess. Don't die. Good boy. 'Jane.' Came to say, I regretted hearing about your loss of the east herd. Our vigilantes will rout these rustlers when that's done. Your riders will likely return. Thank you. You done a head strong thing to hire this man, Lassiter. I had to have somebody, Deacon Tull. He's a wanted murderer, Jane. You fancy that, Jane? Where's that friend of yours? 'Venters.' Flown to Coop, has he? And all the contenders will soon disappear and there will just be you and me. You tell your Lassiter to go. When your riders come back they'll kill him if I don't kill him first. These are fine horses you have, Jane. Should you be up? You shot me and then you saved my life? 'Yes.' Are you glad? So you're Oldring's Masked Rider? Yes. But I never stole or harmed any one in all my life. I only rode and rode. What's he like? Oldring? Men say, he's the best rider on the sage. Except me. You care for him? Yes. What are you, to Oldring? You can't live in the past, Jane. Evening, ma'am. Any news of Bern Venters? How long he's gone? Well, Judkins says, he's keen as a wolf. Oh, I have little fear for him. Lassiter, will you stay for supper? I reckon. My father's room. It's been closed since he died. If I dared, I'd ask you to saddle the blacks and run away and hide me. Oh! No. Forgive me, I didn't mean.. I didn't mean.. It's just.. It's just sometimes I wish I could run away from here. Jane, you can't ride away. What on earth do you mean? I'm an absolutely free woman. You ain't anything of the kind. Years are terrible things. And for years you've been bound. 'Habit of years is strong as life itself.' I'm afraid for you. You're to lose the cattle that's left your home and ranch. Your body's to be held or given to Tull and made to bring children into the world. They've got you. You love your land and your home too much. No. 'Bern, people lived here.' Yes. - How long ago? - Oh, a 1000 years or more. - What were they? - Cliff dwellers. They were Indians who had enemies 'so they made their homes out of reach.' I noticed we hadn't a great deal of cooking. Hello, Venters. I'm making you a visit. How'd you ever get here? Well, I trailed you. Bells heard your voice below. It was my idea, no man could track me in here. 'Oh, this is gonna worry me.' Bess, here's a friend of mine. - He saved my life once. - Hello. I never seen a rock I wanted to roll as bad as this one. You close that, I'll live forever. That there is the only way up into here. Who is this girl? I shot her. I almost killed her. Who is she? She was Oldring's masked rider. Longer I live, the stranger life gets. Might have to leave you in a while, Bess. We're gonna need some supplies if we're going to stay here. When will you go? As soon as the storms passed. There's something I must tell you. Tell it, then. Before you go, I'll tell you. Jane Withersteen? It was your father's wish that you marry Deacon Tull. You remember that? Yes. And you have refused Deacon Tull. Am I right? But now, you will do as I order. Won't you? Jane...you're in danger of becoming a heretic. Why would I know you repent? Now, this gunman, Lassiter. Has he some special mission here? Answer me! Pastor Dyer, I don't wanna tell. He said he came here to find the grave. Of Milly Erne. For what else? For what else? To kill the man who persuaded Milly to abandon her home and her husband. And her God. It's alright, Jane. - Did you kill him? - No. No, I didn't kill him. I winged him. I put a bullet through his arm. Very impolite he was, pulling his gun. Then he went. I never loved anyone but my sister. Milly Erne. You're Milly's brother? There was never anyone but her in my life. Till now. Milly and me grew up together. We was the best of comrades. Frank Erne was the... only man I ever seen who I thought was good enough for Milly. And then one day they got married I got drunk. It was the only time in my life. I went away. I don't know. Before I know, three years slipped by. And when I returned home, things had changed. Mother was...dead and in her grave. Father was a silent, broken man killed already on his feet. Frank Erne was a ghost of his old self. Through with working. Almost through living. And Milly and her baby was gone. It appears, soon after I left home a preacher come to the little town. He was a big shambles of a man with an eye like gray eyes. One day he disappeared and the next evening.. ...Frank rode in to find Milly gone. In time, Frank got a letter from her. It was a long letter. Written a few months after her disappearance. She had been bound and gagged and dragged away from her home. By three men and she named them. Herd, Medsker, Slack. She went on to say that for a time she was out of her head. And she got right again. All that kept her alive was the baby. The letter ended abrupt. I set out to find Milly and I got on the trail of that preacher. I never rested. Not for thirteen years. This last year.. ...I rounded up herd and I whispered somethin' in his ear. Then watched his face. And then I throwed a gun against his bowels. And he died with his teeth so tight shut. I couldn't have pried them open with a knife. Slack and Medsker These last months, both heard me whisper the same question. Then neither would they speak a word when they lay dying. Glad I came here. And though your teeth have been shut tighter than them all them dead men lying back on that trail. Just the same as you. You've told me the secret, I've waited these years to hear. Jane, I told you to tell me without me asking. That old party throwed a gun on me. Lassiter. I saw on your face that it was Dyer. Now Pastor. It was the preacher that ruined Milly Erne. I know it. Let that settle it. And I give up my purpose. I can't kill a man just for hate. Hate ain't the same with me. Since I loved you. For the record, Jane. Marriage between us is outta all human reason. What was it you said? Habit of years is strong as life itself. I need someone. A friend. You. Now, more than ever. Well, I.. ...I didn't say nothing about going back on you. Did I? Will you come back? Look at this rock. Let's see. I can see the hatchet marks of the Indians. It was meant for defense. They never had to roll it. They all vanished and here the rock still stands. When you come back.. ...I'll steal up here and I'll push and push with all my might. To roll this rock and close the pass forever. Can you wait till I get back, Bess? You had something to tell me. I love you. Black star at night. Uh! Oldring. He's riding black star and he's leaving tonight. Tull. Damn, Tull. Aah. 'I sorry, Rango.' Bess. Bess. Hey, Venters. How does Jane look from here? 'Miss Withersteen.' Miss Withersteen. Jane! They've arrested Bern Venters for murder 'and for stealing your horses and I'm afraid they' 'they mean to hang him.' Who accuses him, Hester? They are at the church. Bern didn't steal my horses. I must go now. Will you be safe? They have guards waiting for you. It's all over. It's ended. I'm going. - Where? - To those cruel men. - To Dyer and Deacon Tull. - What for? I'm gonna tell Pastor Dyer I'll marry Tull. Never. You have a coat at your father's. - Answer me, Jane. - In his wardrobe. No, Lassiter. I'm gonna get back and have the saddle bags full and be ready to ride. Haven't you forgone your vengeance on Dyer? It ain't now. It's justice. You'll kill him. If God lets me live another hour. I'll run away with you. Marry you. Lassiter, am I nothing to you? Woman, don't trifle with words. 'It was my father who sent Dyer out to proselytize.' Truly, Dyer ruined Milly and dragged her from her home but it was for my father. It was for my father. It was.. ...my father who had her little girl taken from her. Because she wouldn't be his wife. And when.. ...one night he tried to force her. I heard them fighting. But I did nothing till I heard the shot. And I cradled his head in my apron. And he mouthed words, "I didn't". And then he died. Milly was standing there calmer than I had ever seen her. And she made me vow to stay the hand of vengeance if it ever came. I let her go, I didn't stop her. She shot herself in the willows with the same gun. Jane. 'Jane.' This thing I'm about to do ain't for anything that ever happened in the past. It is for what's happening right now. It's for you. 'Oldring and Bern Venters rustled' 'Ms. Withersteen's racers.' Me and my riders came upon them in the act. This man killed one of the boys. I shot Oldring, captured Venters and got the horses back. He conspired with the rustlers? Yes. 'Where are the horses now?' They're out front. Bern Venters, how answer you to this man's charges? 'Very well.' You are a horse thief and a murderer. And I sentence you to be hanged by the neck until 'you are dead.' Ah! Tull! 'Tull!' It's alright. Shoot. Ah! I reckon you better call quick on that God who reveals his self to you on earth. Because he won't be visiting the place you're going to. 'Let's go.' Tull will likely raise an army and come after us. Can you make it up to your canyon on Bells? - Is Jane alright? - Yeah. Oh, boy. You're hurt? I killed Oldring. Go son. Keep your wits about you. 'Go now.' Are you alright? Bern. Where's Bern? He's headed for his canyon. He killed Oldring in getting Black Star and Night back. I've got them outside and they're ready to ride. Ride out in the sage, and Jane, don't look back. Bern! Bern. You're back. Let's leave. What? Oldring's dead. Bess. Bess? He's my father. What happened? He was shot stealin' horses. Bern. We'll find a country not wild and terrible like this. - Son, where you bound for? - Safety. Milly. Jane, this is Bess. Bess? On the trail with the red herd, I shot Bess. She almost died. 'She was Oldring's masked rider.' But she's innocent. She was a prisoner. 'It's true, Jane. It's as true as her innocence.' 'That you must believe.' You killed Oldring? I did. Did you? Did you kill him? I did, Bess but I never dreamed he was your father. I can't go with you. I thought he'd wronged you. Forgive me, everything will come right in the end. It can't be right. It'll never be right. - Bess. - Let go of me. - Bess. - Let go. Bess. Bess. Open it. Jane, Venters, come close. Take a look at the picture. - Milly Erne. - Yes, that's Milly. Bess, did you ever see that face? Look hard. They're the eyes in my dreams. They're the same beautiful eyes you'd see if you looked in a mirror on a clear spring. They're your mother's eyes. You're Milly Erne's child. Your name is Elizabeth Erne. You're the daughter of Frank Erne, once my best friend. - It can't be true. - Thank God, lass, it is true. Jane recognizes Milly. She sees Milly in you. It is true, Bess. Who are you? I reckon I'm Milly's brother and your uncle. Uncle Jim. Ain't that fine? Uncle Jim? It's powerful fine to hear that. Elizabeth Erne, I loved your mother. Look. 'That buck's going to be tossed.' - You headed for our valley? - You all come with us now. No. I'll take Bess out of here. Man, how you ever gonna do that? Bern. You are a rider, and she is a rider. And this will be the ride of your lives. I give you Black Star and Night. - Lassiter, we'll meet again. - Son, it ain't likely. Ain't so easy to find and lose a pretty niece all in one hour. Elizabeth Erne, be happy. Jane Withersteen. Hold up, Bess. Too far yet for them to make out who we are. They'll recognize Blacks and think we're Lassiter and Jane. Now, Bess. Let's go. It's not them. Whoo! They're in the canyons. Whoo! We got to rustle, Jane. They're riding tired horses, Jane. Venters likely given a chase, he wouldn't forget that. Bear up, Jane. Bear up. This is as far as Bells can go, Jane. Get down. I'll follow you. Jane! Jane, come on. Jane, I can't do it. Roll the stone. 'Jane!' 'If I roll the stone, we're shut in forever.' I'm thinkin' of you. Lassiter, roll the stone! Lassiter, roll the stone. I love you. Roll the stone. Bern, look so you'll never forget. Bess, did you hear anything? 'Listen.' Maybe, I only imagined it.
