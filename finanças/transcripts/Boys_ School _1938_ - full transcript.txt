This film was restored by PATHÉ in 2014 BOYS' SCHOOL The Saint-Agil boys' school exists only in the author's imagination. The characters are invented. We simply wanted viewers to be able to recall the wild imaginings of their youth. Saint-Agil Boys' school Dormitory III Hello, Martin. We were at Article 7. Let's reread it. - Then discuss it. - Discussing is useless. It's best to act once you decide. The point is not to act, but to succeed. That means we study the problem. We examine it. Quiet, please! I'll read. Reports, papers... It's freezing here. Isn't it, Martin? Excuse me? Just chatting with Martin. If he stays in the draft, he'll catch cold. Leave him be! But we have skin on our bones. We've got meat. Like wearing a coat. He's always naked, all year long. - Quiet, please. - I'll stop talking. I'll read. "Activities of the Secret Society of the Chiche-Capons. "Statutes. Article 1. "Our aim is to plan for our members' departure for America. "Article 2. The society has 3 members." Let's take roll call. Member 1? Here. Member 2? Here. Member 3? - Here. - I'll continue. "We meet once a week in Science room. Honorary President: Martin Bones. "Article 4. "None of us will leave for America alone." I disagree. I want to remove that. Too late! You swore! If you could go, you wouldn't abandon us? It's with you or not at all! Easy to say... - May I reread the last notes? - Sure, go on. "A) What shipping company do we use? "B) How do we get aboard? "C) What do we do upon reaching America the Free? "D) Review the mail-order catalogue for shotguns and bicycles." Footsteps. Must be Planet. Planet again? He must be a sleepwalker! No, he's insomniac. Same thing. So I guess we'll meet next week for the report. And we'll leave in 10 years. All you do is complain! - A mere observation. - And your point? If Columbus behaved like us, he'd have discovered nothing. Would he have left without studying a map? Studying a map? He took an egg, balanced it on the tip and set sail. He left. That's what Columbus did. I'd do the same. On that note, I'm off to bed. Me too. - Coming? - No, I'm working on my novel. His novel... What's it about? Lots of stuff. Our adventures when we get there. "When we get there." Damn that sounds sad. Coming? Chapter IV The three "chiche-capons", after ups (and downs), reach the Mexican border. 2nd encounter with mysterious man... - Sorgues, why are you back? - I saw something. Listen, Sorgues! I hope you didn't get caught. No, I saw something. Something fantastic! Talking? In the middle of the night? I can't believe my ears! Tell us tomorrow. We'll say we're sick. Debriefing at the infirmary. This is unbelievable! Still talking? In the middle of the night? I've never heard anything like this! You're talking to yourself, my friend. Sorry, Mr. Planet. You're forgiven. Come on, young men! Get up! Quiet, please! Get up, young men! Come on! Hurry up! Why are you waiting? - Didn't hear the wake-up call? - I did... And? They were talking. I didn't sleep a wink. So I wasn't dreaming. I heard talk. - Who was it? - It was... - Who? - I don't know, sir. I fell right back asleep. Macroy! - What is it? - I'm sick. - What is it? - Shore throat. It's all red. Sore like after a day at the beach. - Sir... - What? - I'm sick too. - What is it? Like Macroy. It stings, it hurts. - Sir, I'm in pain. - What's your problem? It hurts here. This is very strange. - Sir. - What's your problem? - I have it. - What? A shore throat. Incredible! - Hello, Mr. Planet. - Hello, Donadieu. I hope you slept well. Please, spare me your jokes. - How so? - You know! I'm cursed with insomnia and every morning I'm asked if I slept well. It's stupid. And uncalled for. Hello, Lemel. Donadieu, Planet... Sleep well, Planet? No, Mr. Lemel. I didn't sleep well. I never sleep! You hear me? Never! Do I ask if you got plastered well? As for your insinuations... I'm not insinuating anything. I say what others whisper. You drink alone! In private! Mr. Planet, you're a visionary. You have no personality. An oddball, a maniac... In sum, a sleepwalker. As such, I disdain you. He disdains me. Hear? This alcoholic disdains me! This man who drinks in private and totters in public. What? I totter? You'll see who totters! Gentlemen, don't fight! French vs. French? While on the verge of war, with foreigners at the gate? Hello, gentlemen. I hope you slept well. Yes, Principal... I mean... no. Well, just a little. Gentlemen... Hello, Mr. Walter. That Mr. Walter really doesn't look like a pleasant man. - Indeed. - Come now, gentlemen! I'd even say a perjurer. - He scares the kids. - Enough! He is surely a good person. He's new here but I have no complaints. On the contrary. A little closed up, but an excellent language teacher. I dislike foreigners. We mustn't make sweeping statements. As with everyone, there are good and bad. But I know he's a bad one. Good or bad, it's foreigners who lead us to war. Can't you watch out? Sorry, I didn't see you. No reason to trample! Run with your eyes open. Eyes open, you hear? Yes, I'm not deaf. What? Answering back? Standing up to me? Bad little seed! I'll teach you to be polite! Children are meant to obey! You hear? Obey! Good for nothing! Rascal! Excuse me, Mr. Lemel. It's not nice to scream at children. They're fragile. Children are sensitive. Shouting frightens them. And that face of yours doesn't frighten them? Believe me, Mr. Lemel, shouting is a very poor way to rear children. If I shouted into your ears, for example, to teach you to be polite, if I shouted like this... Gentlemen! What's going on here? Principal Boisse, this maniac is constantly provoking me. Pardon me, sir. Mr. Lemel is exaggerating. I was just explaining something. Follow me, Mr. Walter. I'd like a word. Like I said, a man appeared as if out of a wall, then vanished. Vanished into a wall. Yes, we got it. You made us come here for that? But I saw it with my own eyes! Stop with your novel. It's making you totally loco! Laugh if you want. Something fishy is going on. Enough! No more chattering. This is an infirmary here. We're gargling, not chattering. Then gargle in silence! Now don't move around anymore. You're not sick. Why are you here? I lied. It's not me who's sick. It's my turtle. - Sick how? - He won't eat. - What do you feed him? - Nothing. Why? I don't know what they eat. - They eat lettuce. - Lettuce? Thanks. Who's that boy? He's so young. Son of Mr. Brézillet, a teacher who died. He was a widower, so the principal and I kept the kid. Brézillet was a strange man. A specialist in occult science. Believe in the occult? Don't ask me... I do. I'm telling you for your own good. You're not pleasant enough. You're violent. This explains your colleagues' hostility. Their hostility, Principal, doesn't bother me at all. I come here to work. And I work. I ask nothing more. At Saint-Agil, Mr. Walter, working is not enough. You must be appreciated. It seems that even the children... I mean... You bother them... You frighten them. Me? I frighten children? Mr. Mazeau, got any chewing gum? That's another American invention. Eating rubber is absurd. Do I eat my suspenders? - Got any lettuce? - Lettuce? - Yeah! - Not here. - I'll give you some later. - Thanks, that's nice of you. - Why ask for lettuce? - For the kid's turtle. Eavesdropping again? The schoolyard is for everyone. My kick in the butt will be just for you. They want to hit me! Aren't you big enough to defend yourself? 3 against 1! Not true! We wouldn't attack all at once. They would! They always threaten me. And they're always together. Plotting God knows what. They even talk at night! There's something fishy. I didn't ask you a thing. Why are you telling me this? Because it's fishy. It's not nice to spy on classmates, Fermier. If you keep it up, we'll no longer be friends. I'm warning you. Not friends at all. I'd like to ask you a question. Will you answer me frankly? Yes, sir. Do I scare you? No, sir. Rumor has it. A rumor spread by liars. Why would you? Nothing scares us. Thank you. I was afraid to say sometimes he does scare me. - Why? - I don't know. I find him weird. Quiet, please. For today's dictation I have chosen an author who is not part of our curriculum, but I thought it would be a nice change from the classics. I am referring to Wells. W-E-L-L-S. H.G. H.G. Wells, author of many novels, the most famous of which is this. L'Homme Invisible. In English: The Invisible Man. I will read you several passages. The Invisible Man is a man who has found a way to disappear as he pleases. Of course, this realm of the fantastic is obviously implausible. It's not implausible! I saw it. Saw what? What was that, Sorgues? Have you read it? No, but I saw one. One what? A man who appears and disappears. Quiet, please! Sorgues has lost his mind. Quiet. Sorgues. I'm warning you. I don't appreciate jokes of the sort. And now, dictation. I didn't dream it. I saw him! Who spoke? Sorgues, is that you who spoke? Yes, I saw him as clearly as I see you. - Who? - The man who disappears. Here he goes again! Young men! Quiet! Sorgues... I'm sorry. I cannot accept being made fun of like this. I must ask you to leave. He is really not well. Maybe he saw something. Saw what? A headless man munching his hair? I'd like some quiet! Give that directly to the Principal. I thought I was being nice to all of you by adding some variety to the curriculum. But alas I realize that I was wrong. And so the subject of today's dictation will not be The Invisible Man, but Shakespeare's life. In short, Mr. Walter kicked you out for clowning around. So you're inventing this tall tale. No, sir. I swear! I just said it aloud. I swear I saw a man! A supernatural one. And what's more, in the Natural Science classroom. And at night. What were you doing there? An embarrassing question... I cannot tell you, Principal. I can't. It's a secret. A secret? You have too much imagination. It can be a dangerous thing. You may go back to class. Why bother asking me for lettuce? And now that you've finished, let's try a different kind of exercise. Visual memory. Pass around this bill. Look at it quickly, both sides. Don't linger over it. Quickly! Remember. Visual memory is essential in learning to draw. Let's start with Grévin... What did you see on that bill? What did it say? It said... "100 francs". Billard, what did you see? There was a man with an anvil. And... a woman carrying a shovel. - And... - And what? - Hammer and anvil. - Lousy visual memory. Lots of numbers. What did you see? I saw five women... maybe even six. That's right. Six women. Why are you laughing? Sir, they're naked. No reason to continue. Everyone looks without seeing. This explains why the real masterpieces go unnoticed. Not one of you thought of checking the artist's signature. The engraver's signature. I once knew a great engraver. What did his genius get him? He teaches a group of idiots! Why are you laughing? The same three smart-aleck musketeers! I'll make you toe the line. Macroy, up! Baume, up! Sorgues, up! Sorgues, up! - Where is he? - Not here, sir. Did he have a permission slip? He didn't go out. He never showed up. You mean Sorgues wasn't in our art class? Where is he? Sorgues disappeared. - So? - Nothing. Not a trace. We asked around. No trace. Absent. Vanished. Gone. Let's not overdramatize. This is surely no more than a runaway student. Perhaps... Sorgues is impressionable. When he kicked Sorgues out of class, Walter was probably a bit violent. As usual. Mr. Lemel, I beg to differ. I did what I had to. Children are sensitive. Intimidation never helps. I must ask you not to use this tone. I say what I have to. Students tend to run away when the school they run from has teachers who scare them. Don't you ever say that again! Mr. Walter... Behave yourself. I'm sorry, Principal. There are times... when I'm truly capable of anything. I'd like your permission to leave now. To think some people still think there won't be a war. Please spare us with your war. I beg your pardon. Look what was in Sorgues' desk. Strange. Ship schedules, mail-order catalogues, prices... Our young friend had it all planned. But he won't make it far. Maybe he made it to his family. Did you telegraph the parents? Good. Planet, get me his two classmates. Baume and Macroy? Yes, sir. Baume, Sorgues and Macroy. Quite a trio. I hope you didn't tell everyone. I want this unfortunate incident kept under wraps. Sir, I've been remarkably discreet. - And yet... - You may go. All right, sir. And yet, I am terribly anxious. I asked you to leave. Yes, sir. Terribly anxious because I am sure Sorgues was hypnotized. Someone here has the evil eye. And I'll prove it. Hypnotized. Why not bewitched? Occult science will end up making that Mazeau crazy. - Maybe it's true. - What? Someone has an evil eye. Mr. Lemel, you're not in your normal state. What? How dare you say that? In front of Donadieu, the school's worst gossip? This isn't nice. This isn't kind. I'm sick of being watched, spied on! - One of these days... - Yes? Come in. You men may leave. Mazeau, what are you doing? Thinking. I am more and more sure the kid was put to sleep. - To sleep? - Yes, you heard me. Hypnotism. By the eyes. You can't understand. You never sleep. After all, maybe Planet has it. - Has what? - The evil eye. Evil eye... You won't talk. It's not that we won't, but that we can't. We know nothing. Fine. I was counting on your honesty, your loyalty... I see I was mistaken. I swear, Sorgues said nothing. I can swear it as well. Good evening, Principal. Good evening, Mr. Planet. Don't have bad dreams. Good evening, Mr. Walter. Isn't it odd that Walter went out tonight? He never usually does. You're the odd one. A kid runs away and you see mystery all over. Mysteries are for books, but in life it's very rare. Believe me. Good evening, sir. You shouldn't have come. Something happened. It's because something happened that I came. I don't think you know what happened. Obviously I'm kept in the dark. I'm being used, spied on, watched. This persecution madness is no good. I've had enough. I feel like everyone suspects me. It's unbearable. At times I want to talk, shout. I'm suffocating! If you talk, you may suffocate even more. I might add that you could suffocate for good. Why are you here? To keep you company, because deep down, you dislike drinking alone. Cigarette? Me neither. What's this? The life of Dürer, a great artist. You like other people's lives? Obviously, since mine is a failure. Why complain? You can afford to live well. Live well... I'm not curious but... I'd like to know how you spend your money. You see these Dürer reproductions? Well, they're not reproductions. They're originals. That's how I spend my money. Admirable artwork. True masterpieces. I don't like art. It serves no purpose. How can you say a thing like that? Careful... Let's play a round. If you want to. You really think art serves no purpose? None at all at all. Once it's on the wall, it's over. I'm a simple man. I like simple, amusing objects. Switchblade, box of matches. Simple, amusing objects. Knives can sharpen pencils. Matches can light fires. Knives can also cut throats. Matches can also burn down houses, forests. What can you do with art? Number 8. I have it. - 12. - I have it too. Bingo is a wonderful game. To think that others bust their brains to play chess... Number 65. - I have it again. - No way, you're cheating. Number... 90. I have it... 78. I have it. I'm sick of this! Mr. Lemel... I'm asking you as politely as possible to stop drinking no matter what. Booze is bad. Makes you do and say stupid things. Unless you drink like me, once in a while. What did you do with that boy? In any respectable boarding school, children who don't stay in bed get punished. We'll start with roll call. Baume? Here. - Macroy? - Here. Sorgues? Sorgues is missing. And now the minutes. "We condemn Sorgues' behavior. "He shouldn't have gone to America without us. "Without money, lacking real initiative, "without mastering English, "he is doomed to fail, and deservedly so." Sign. I won't. I disagree. He was right to leave. - Planet. - Yes, Planet. We should go to sleep. 5 crates of bubbly. 14 boxes of cookies. 4 crates of lemonade. And where are the garlands? Mazeau, do you have the mail? I have no time for mail. Delivery time. Tomorrow is the party and we have no garlands. - Mail's on my desk. - I'll sort it. Garlands are always last minute. It's not hard to order in advance. Such bad organization! How odd. What is it? A postcard for Baume. From America. America? That's wild! New York is fantastic. Signed "Chiche-Capon". Very odd name. Chiche-Capon? Can I help you, Mr. Walter? I'd like to know if I received a letter. He asks every day. Never a single letter. Odd. Maybe Baume's postcard is from Sorgues... Postcard from Sorgues? Why not? He's been missing two weeks. It's signed Chiche-Capon. So what? It may be a nickname. What about my lettuce? You promised me lettuce. I'm taking care of it. - Baume! - Here, sir. Amazing! He was a bastard to go alone. But making it there is amazing. Why did he send it only to you? I don't know. Not nice. He could have sent me one. Or put my name on it too. We'll be questioned. Planet stared at me. That damn rat again! Here's what we do to rats. Rub their ears! Then we yank out their bones! That hurts! You bullies! Rotten pigs! Two against one! Here's your lettuce. - Macroy, out! - But sir... - I said to leave! - If it makes you happy. How dare you? I order you out of the class and you say "if it makes you happy"? In that case go straight to the Principal's office. If it makes you happy. After this very unfortunate incident, let's now play March of the Giants. On my cue! Principal, when I saw that Macroy wasn't here, I thought: now he's gone. Children, don't worry. Sleep well. Your classmate is surely nearby. - This is extremely worrisome. - Extremely. - Principal... - What is it? Sir, this afternoon... in the schoolyard, Baume and Macroy said all sorts of stuff. Wait until tomorrow. Now everyone must calm down and go to sleep. Come, come... It's time for bed now. Principal... I searched everywhere. No sign of him. But I thought it over. A detail struck me. A mysterious detail and I'm growing more and more anxious. You'd better go to sleep. Very well, sir. I found Sorgues' lettuce on the floor. Macroy asked for some today. Now I can't find his lettuce. Why? The question is: Why lettuce and for whom? A mystery! Where is everyone? Quiet, please! Whoever's not in bed in 3 minutes will miss tomorrow's party. What did you tell the principal? I'll bash your face in. Don't hurt me. I know something. What? You lost your postcard. You stole it from me? No, but I know who has it. I said to be quiet! Boys... lights out now. Come in. Give me back my postcard. Your postcard? What postcard? The one from America. You picked it up. Give it back. What are you talking about? Fine, then. You don't trust me? I trust no one here. Martin Bones Adventures of the Chiche-Capons Sorgues... missing. Macroy... missing. - Baume... - Here. I knew I'd find you here. Martin Bones Adventures of the Chiche-Capons. It's all very simple. The others ran away and you were about to. Don't bother running. You're free. I'm expelling you. Three elements of disorder. Two are gone. When you leave, order will return. I'll telegraph your guardian. Lie low until he comes. You may attend tomorrow's party. That's all I can do. Hernani, the time has come for you to die. What will you do to me? You may choose... knife or poison? - What did you do? - What you wished for. What an awful death! What are you doing? Doña Sol, all is now dark. - Are you suffering? - Nothing, no more. Do you see flames? Not yet. Doña Sol... Bring your face closer. Closer, closer still... Dead? I am damned to hell. Magnificent! I like it when the cadavers get up to take a bow. Usually the living pay respect to the dead. The buffet is open. Drinks! Help yourselves. Tragedies make me thirsty. Mr. Lemel, you've had enough champagne. What else should I drink, sir? Children are better off with lemonade. Besides, champagne can do no harm. No one's nastier than a teetotaler. Right, Mr. Walter? You look awful, Mr. Walter. An awful little spy! Don't keep on making a scene! Why not? If I drink, I have my reasons. I can even tell you them. And I will explain them, Principal. Shut up or you'll be disciplined! Disciplined? I'm all washed up, a loser. Discipline? None of that matters. Come, Mr. Lemel. Let's take a little walk. Let's get fresh air. Fresh air? Why? There's no more liquor. But I have some champagne at my place. You're a wonderful fellow. Go ahead. I'll follow discreetly. Come. One mustn't make a spectacle of oneself. Come on, Mr. Lemel. Yes, I drink. So what? If I were successful, a great artist, people would think it's fine. All the great men drank. Charlemagne himself drank. Henry IV drank too. We all know. Come on, Mr. Lemel. Ravaillac too. Michelangelo, Robinson Crusoe, and... Du Guesclin, and Philip the Fair. Come on already! Philip the Fair. Now he was something. He burned the Templars because they were spying on him. He was right to. I'm being spied on too. Because I'm a guy along the lines of... Philip the Fair. Here's why... Principal! What's going on? What is it? I don't know. The fuse box blew. Emergency lamps! Keep calm. Don't move. Mr. Lemel fell! Here is a lamp. Mind the little ones. Come fast. He fell here. - What happened? - No idea. - A doctor, fast. - No, wait. He's dead. A terrible accident. An accident... Yes... an accident. How terrible. He almost landed on me. I was here. He fell there. Close call. Mr. Planet, please inform the police captain. Very well, sir. Mazeau, find out which fuses blew. Replace them. Here. Children, go to sleep. Everyone, upstairs. Go to bed, children. See how he fell? From the third floor. - No blood! - But he landed on his head. Since you're here, take this. I'll check the fuses. This one's fine. This one too. And this. Maybe this one. Yes, that was it. And now... go to bed. - The party started well. - And ended badly. This Mr. Lemel was a drinker? Now that he's dead, we can say he drank. - Especially tonight. - I see. Without a doubt he fell over the railing. Can you explain to me the reason for the blackout? I don't know. A short-circuit. We've always had electrical problems. If you don't mind, I'd like to go to the scene to see exactly where he fell. A mere formality before delivering a burial permit. Come on, young men! Get up! Everyone, up. Why are you so slow? Hurry up! So, Baume? Get up, Baume, up! Baume! Where is Baume? Baume? Where is Baume? Have you seen him? He's not here. That makes three. Already done? Eat slowly! You wolf it down! Eat slowly. He's right. It's not normal to vanish. - After Sorgues, Macroy. - After Macroy, Baume. Who'll be next? I'm going to write home. I won't stay here. I'll change schools. Maybe there's a vampire here. - A vampire? - Yeah, a bloodsucker! - I don't want to stay here! - Come now, calm down. The atmosphere is becoming unbearable. If you ask me, these are bad omens. Believe me, it's going to blow. It's going to blow! Like a storm. - What? - War. I came for my postcard. And I found it. Step back! Stay where you are or I'll shout. I'll scream! You're mad. What's gotten into you? I'm suspicious. Of everyone here! Are you afraid of me? I wasn't before. But I think I was wrong. Don't move. Stay where you are. All right. I won't move. But how did you get in here? They're all looking for you. They think you disappeared like the others. I didn't disappear. I made it look like I did. There are things I want to know. And will know. - Why did you take my card? - Why? Because Sorgues' disappearance seemed strange. I wanted to know. Know what? To know who sent you that postcard. It was Sorgues. No. It wasn't Sorgues. He may not have mailed it, but he wrote it. I know his handwriting. Except... Except what? He didn't use the sign. Martin Bones. Which means he was warning us! To say: "Careful!" I know about what! He didn't go to America voluntarily. He was kidnapped. I have proof. He was writing a novel, his one passion. He didn't even take it! - So? - So it's simple. They didn't let him take it. I don't know who "they" are but I'll find out. Look at that postcard carefully and you'll see, like me... that the postal stamp... is a fake. This doesn't come from New York. It was just put in the school mailbox by someone who wants to make it seem that Sorgues left for America. But who is this someone? I don't know. I'm searching. You, maybe. You still suspect me? Me? I am here to help you. The two of us may be able to figure this out. I don't trust you. You were angry last night. You threatened Mr. Lemel. When I'm provoked, I become violent. Very violent! Probably why Lemel fell down the stairs. What are you saying? You're mad! Do you really believe that? I was just joking. You're not in on that. I was next to you when Lemel was killed. You speak without proof. Proof? Here it is. A fork. Short-circuits are easy. Look. And easy to throw a drunk down the stairs. Very compelling. Whom do you suspect? I already told you: everyone. Except myself. And you. So you trust me? You had nothing to do with the fork. For the rest... What a strange place, Saint-Agil's boys' school. When Sorgues said a man appeared out of the wall, I made fun of him. I was wrong! He saw something in that classroom. It's why he's gone. I'll go looking tonight. - Looking for what? - No idea. But I'll find it. - Find what? - No idea. In that case I'll come along. If you want to. But I'm warning you: one false move and I'll scream my lungs out! I'll put up more of a fight. Very well. What do you think of Philip the Fair? Philip the Fair? What's this about? What do you think of him? Philip the Fair was a French king. Lemel shouted he was like Philip the Fair. He fell. Know what Philip the Fair did? Not much, I think. He counterfeited money. How odd. Sorgues and Macroy were kidnapped because they saw too much. Sorgues saw a man who appeared and disappeared from a wall! A wall? Ridiculous! You know what we look like? Well... We look like two imbeciles. Sorgues saw a man appearing in and out of a wall. Enough! That expression is becoming unbearable. "Appearing and disappearing." Either I'm a madman or an idiot. Footsteps. Come. We won't find anything here. - So stubborn! - Stubborn or not, I stay. All right... Stay. If you want anything, you know where to find me. Philip the Fair. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm invoking the moon. It's a Mexican custom. And Sorgues, prisoner of the counterfeiters in the old Mexican mill suddenly began invoking... the moon... ... and the moon answered him: "Chiche-Capon." Chiche-Capon? - What does that mean? - Leave me alone! I don't want anyone over my shoulder! But I can't even read. - So why stare? - It's fun. It's annoying! This kid has some imagination! Where does he get it? I told you, Bernardin. I hate having someone over my shoulder. Especially if he can't read! Is that my fault? I'm fed up! It's my home, my mill! Your mill? What a classy mill! It's something else. It's a ruin. Ruins and dust. Is it my fault if the big mills ruined me? If my wife left me for a big-time miller? Spare me! Next it'll be my fault that you're counterfeiting! I had to do something. I get bored doing nothing. Good thing we have the kid. It makes it worth it. Reading his serial is the best part of the day. Let me read in peace. Don't read over my shoulder. I want to know what happens. Read out loud. If it makes you happy. "And in the old Mexican mill "which smelled musty, "poor Sorgues was their prisoner. "Bernardin, also known as "Bernardin Boulder Head" "because he was hard-headed, "was in charge of watching him "because he was an illiterate brute. "But deep down, he wasn't a mean Mexican." Is that me? He put me in the book? That's wonderful! I'll make you some coffee! "There was also Alexis the miller. "He smoked on his pipe all day. "When his accomplices spoke of him in secret, "they called him "Cuckold" and laughed." Very funny. Well observed. "The third one..." This is me. "... looked like one of those guys who talks a lot "but does nothing." Well observed too. I've had enough! If you read out loud, how can I write? I don't get it! And I asked for quills and blotting paper! Don't you get upset again. This will make you feel better. It's strong but I added milk. Coffee is good for people who use their brains. Thanks, Bernardin. You're kind. "One day, Sorgues learned that "3 Stars" "- the nickname of his Art teacher, "because of the brandy he drank — "that "3 Stars" was part of the gang." "3 Stars." Poor Lemel... Won't be drawing any more bills. - You didn't kill him? - Are you crazy? I never killed anyone! Besides, I wasn't asked to kill him. Just to keep an eye on him. Wait for me there. You're too little! Go back to sleep. You, here? I think it's risky. - Want to rescue him? - Of course. Go to the other dorms and tell them to meet us. Hurry up. Talking? Who spoke? In the middle of the night? But I told you I don't want to go! I'll rip out your tongue! Follow me. I'm dreaming... Funny dream... There's Baume! The third one to vanish. What's that mill? Just a mill. Butt out. Crouch down. Can we get inside? We need to get Sorgues and Macroy out. - See Macroy? - No. Probably separated. He's tough. I bet they locked him in the basement. I want to go. Keep it down! - I want to go. - So go! - I'm scared of the trees. - So shut up. - What now? - Our strategy. We deploy in battle array. Dorm 3: the oldest. Assault troops. Center! Dorm 2: covering force. Right! Dorm 1: small kids. The reserves. Hurry up! Take up the rear! This is called night maneuvers. Why is he locked in a mill? To turn the grindstone. Yeah, like slaves! Those bastards. Oh man, my butt is cold! You're just scared. Understand? We overwhelm the enemy. - I need a volunteer. - Me. What for? To come with me. - Into the mill? - Of course. I'm too scared to go. - I'll go. - Fine. Now head for the door. But quietly. Come on. Leaving? I don't like murder. What are these? They're reproductions. Totally worthless. A souvenir of Lemel. It's definite? You're leaving? Counterfeiting never ends well. Keep quiet! Don't insist. Look. More in the rear. These kids are gutsy. Under siege by Lilliputians. What do you want? Sorgues. Is that all? What else? - And Macroy. - Macroy? Macwhat? Macwho? - Our friend. - He's not here. Oh, your friend... What do you know? He's in the basement. Obviously! Get him on the double! Yeah, we'll go get him. To the basement! Downstairs! - The station is miles away. - The station? I'll deal with this. It wasn't too hard? Nice guys. I had them in the palm of my hand. - Who kidnapped you? - You'll never guess. Baume! They ran away. - Who? - The bandits! They won't make it far! Pirollo! Pirollo! - What's wrong? - How can you ask that? They've all disappeared! You're out of your mind. Crazy, just like I said. Mazeau! - Mazeau! - What? The dorms are empty! The kids are gone! Come back! I told you that they're here! What's going on? This is it! War! What now? You don't want to go inside? Why not? We're scared. There was a crime! - A killer. - We could get kidnapped! Enough. I'll go in with Sorgues. Stop anyone from leaving. And if it's the killer? Take him prisoner! Quiet! Sir! Principal! It's a scandal! They're crazy! A real scandal! They made me go. They talk nonsense. They say you kidnapped Sorgues and killed Mr. Lemel and Macroy! Baume told me. - He said... - What? You killed your accomplice, Lemel. He's lying. He wants revenge for being expelled. He kidnapped me when I told him I saw a mysterious man. He sent me back to class through that door and popped out of that one when I was in the hall. Just where I found the lettuce! Principal... the evil eye... is you! Lemel's killer... is you. And you killed Macroy! No! I've done bad things but... You've lost, Boisse. Yes. I lost. But Macroy's disappearance is not my doing. I could never hurt a child. I don't know where he is. That's the truth. I'm sorry. I fell asleep. You're forgiven. Hear? Macroy is back! - You see? - Now this is good news. Because the locals were talking... I was afraid to tell you... You understand. Baume! Sorgues! How are you? Where were you? - America! - No way! Not really, but almost. - Almost? - I was in Le Havre. On the Normandie. I snuck aboard. But then they caught me. - Amazing. - You're incredible! Principal Boisse will kill me. Don't worry. Boisse is over with. He was the gang leader. Counterfeit money. Macroy! Mr. Walter, will you attend our secret meeting later tonight in the Science classroom? I certainly will. With pleasure. Hello, Martin. Hello, Martin. Mr. President... Mr. Walter. Chiche-Capons. Sir, the Secret Society of the Chiche-Capons, for your services rendered, has unanimously decided to make you Honorary President. You may speak. My friends, I thank you. Mr. President... I am very, very honored. Subtitles: Andrew Litvack A restoration carried out by Eclair Group on the image and by L.E. Diapason on the sound with the support of the CNC
