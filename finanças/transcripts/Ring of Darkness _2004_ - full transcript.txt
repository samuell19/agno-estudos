And what you've done to me. - [Xavier] Oh, you need us, Gordo. You're nothing without us. - That's not true. That's not true, and you know it! - [Xavier] Oh, really? What are you gonna do, Gordo? (chuckles) Go solo? - Yeah, yeah. And I'm gonna let everybody know what you are, too. - [Xavier] Really, what are you gonna tell them? - I'm gonna tell them the truth! I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to Billboard. I'll go to SPIN. Hell, I'll even go to the National Enquirer! - [Xavier] (laughs) Even the Enquirer wouldn't believe your story. - They don't have to believe it. All they got to do is print it. You'll be finished. You'll be done. - Oh, no, Gordo. We'll never be finished. You, on the other hand.

As fans of the chart-topping pop act Take 10 know, Campos island is home to the band's private house and studio, though this is as close as most of us can get. Earlier today, a representative for the band issued a statement that their highly popular lead singer, Gordo McSteel, has been entered into drug rehab following a dramatic incident late last night in which the other four members of the group, Xavier Doorsberg, B.J. Banyon, Jake Slater, and Kyle West, performed an intervention. The band was celebrating the end of their Love Songs From the Street tour with a party here on the island when McSteel, 21, attempted to sneak out of the hotel with a bag full of drugs. The group expressed regret about the incident. - (sighs) Gordo's a great guy and my best friend. The rest of the guys and I just want to make sure He stayed healthy. And, well, he's getting the help he needs now. You can beat this thing, buddy, you can. - McSteel has been flown to an undisclosed private rehab clinic where he is expected to undergo a long and intensive treatment for his dependency. And in an unprecedented talent search for such an established group, the band will conduct a nationwide open audition for his replacement. â™ª When you do what you do to me â™ª â™ª I feel it in my veins â™ª â™ª The rhythm of your body is drivin' me insane â™ª â™ª Can't stop the motion, no, it's not reality â™ª â™ª Just can't stop â™ª â™ª Yeah, you're gonna rock me till the dawn â™ª â™ª 'Cause, girl, you're sexin' me â™ª â™ª When you do what you do to me â™ª â™ª I feel it in my veins â™ª â™ª The rhythm of your body is drivin' me insane â™ª â™ª Oh â™ª â™ª Can't stop the motion, no, it's not reality â™ª â™ª Just can't stop â™ª â™ª Yeah, you're gonna rock me till the dawn â™ª â™ª 'Cause, girl, you're sexin' me â™ª - [Announcer] Each contestant will come up here on the stage and give it their best shot, so, ladies, what we need you to do is give it up for these guys and make them feel like they're already members of Take 10.

Oh, he wrote down on his application that he wants to be an astrophysicist. - Well, put him down on the list as, uh, maybe. - Oh, already accepted at Yale. Think we can compete? - Yeah, I think he'll change his mind once he cashes his first million-dollar paycheck. - Okay, so it's him and the guy from Boston, Jonah St. Clair. How many else are we looking for? - One more, I need at least three people to choose from. â™ª Can't stop movin' till the night is gone â™ª â™ª Oh â™ª â™ª Just can't stop â™ª - You think I'm gonna have any credibility after this, sharing the stage with, with those? I mean, look at them, those dorks, you know? - All right. Shawn, do you know Donnie Wahlberg did After he left the New Kids? - What's that? - He punched Mel Gibson and shot Bruce Willis. Not very dorky, eh? - A little different, Stacy. Look, I'm a musician. That's what I do, all right? - But really, it's all about changing your image. Who knows where this could take you? - Okay, okay. So fine, I'd rather build my image at the clubs, you know, but I can almost assure you, and I mean this, that I will not pass this audition. - Then what do you have to lose by trying, then? - My dignity and my self-respect. - John Walker? - Uh, no, man. It's, uh Shawn. - [Assistant] Right, anyway, if you're him, you're next. - Do this, honey. You won't regret it. - I'm afraid, miss, you're gonna have to wait in the audience. - I'll be cheering for you. - Okay. - You won't be needing that guitar. - Hey, hey, hey! This is a vintage fender acoustic, man. - [Assistant] I'll try not to ruin it, okay? - Okay, yeah, you do that. (people chattering) (audience applauding) - [Announcer] His name is Shawn Walker! Let's give it up for Shawn Walker! - What's up, fellas? Uh, I'm Shawn. - Yeah, whatever. Nice jacket, rebel. - Thanks, man. - You know the song? - Yeah, sure. I listened to it a few times on the way over here. It's pretty catchy. You guys write that yourselves? - Man, this sounds like it's gonna go by quick. - Let's just get this over with, okay? Man, we got eight other auditions after you. - You're Kyle, right? Thought you were supposed to be the sensitive one. (upbeat funk music) â™ª Yeah â™ª â™ª Oh â™ª â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª â™ª You know, I can't stop what happens, girl â™ª â™ª When you get next to me â™ª â™ª My temperature's rising to 103 â™ª â™ª The curves of your body really make me wanna shout â™ª â™ª I know you're gonna show me what you do â™ª â™ª And gonna show me what it's all about â™ª â™ª 'Cause you're so hot to the touch â™ª â™ª I'm never gonna get enough â™ª â™ª You really got it goin' on â™ª â™ª Take me up to the top, give me everything you've got â™ª â™ª Can't stop movin' till the night is gone â™ª â™ª Oh â™ª â™ª Just can't stop â™ª â™ª When you do what you do to me â™ª â™ª I feel it in my veins â™ª â™ª The rhythm of your body is drivin' me insane â™ª â™ª Just can't stop â™ª â™ª Can't stop the motion, no, it's not reality â™ª â™ª Yeah, you're gonna rock me till the dawn â™ª â™ª 'Cause, girl, you're sexin' me â™ª - Who is that? - Shawn Walker. Oh, you're not gonna like this. It reads like an anti-application. - Well, a little rebelliousness is all right, long as it can be kept under control. - Well, listen to this. Under previous experiences, he wrote real music. - He wouldn't be here if he didn't want to join the group. - [Assistant] Or if you want to put out the hotel fires. â™ª I'm never gonna get enough â™ª â™ª You really got it goin' on â™ª â™ª Just can't stop â™ª - He's the one. He's our third pick. - And if we find someone else in Columbus? - He stays. â™ª When you do what you do to me â™ª â™ª I feel it in my veins â™ª â™ª The rhythm of your body is drivin' me insane â™ª â™ª Just can't stop â™ª â™ª Can't stop the motion, no, it's not reality â™ª â™ª Yeah, you're gonna rock me till the dawn â™ª â™ª 'Cause, girl, you're sexin' me â™ª (crowd cheering) - [Announcer] Whoa, whoa, whoa, ladies! You are eating him up, whoo! (tense music) - Well, hell. (scoffs) A band? My ass. I'd hardly call you guys a band. I hereby christen you, P-I-S-S. (dramatic music) Oh, can I help you guys, somehow?

You're in the big leagues now. - Well, I'm not sure if I'd call Take 10 the big leagues. You got it? - Oh, come on. Number-one album for 10 weeks straight? Sounds big enough to me. - Okay, here's the thing. Name me just one, one song from their album. - (chuckles) Mm, what's that Baby song? - (chuckles) See, see? Exactly, you can't. - So what, Shawn? You won the chance to be the front man for the biggest pop act since The Beatles, And you still have trouble with it? - Oh, whoa, whoa, wait a second, here. The Beatles were not a pop act, all right? - Shawn Walker, glad you could make it. I'm Alex Marshall, I manage the band. - Nice to meet you, Alex. Well, thank you for this opportunity. - Oh, no thanks necessary. I have impeccable taste. I'm sure you won't let me down. - Well, you know, I'm still trying to decide if I, uh, want this gig. - if you're so uncertain, why are you the first one here? - Thanks for letting me come along. - Not a problem. Ordinarily, I, uh, wouldn't want our singers to be distracted, but-- - Well, you know, I wouldn't come without her. Where I go, she goes. - I see. Well, it appears I'm not the only one with good taste. (upbeat music) (horn honks) Mm, here comes the competition. â™ª Hey, hey â™ª â™ª Hey, hey â™ª â™ª From the first we met each other â™ª - I don't believe you know Jonah. He was discovered during our auditions in Boston. - Nice to meet you, man. - Nice to meet you. - You, too, yeah. - And Max, I believe you do know. You two auditioned at the same time. - How you doing, man? - I'm good. You were good at the audition, I gotta tell you. - Hey, what can I say, man? Max is short for maximum. - [Jonah] Oh, you seem pretty confident. - Well, that's what it takes to make it, baby! - Well, after you get settled in, we'll have some lunch, And then we'll, uh, get down to business. - Another audition? - We're gonna see how you work with the band, see how you all interact, get a sense of what your strengths are. - Cool, let me at them. - Don't waste any time, do you? - Money never sleeps. If you'll follow me, I'll have someone show you to your rooms. - Great, this will be a blast. - [Max] Let's go. (upbeat music) - Hello, gentlemen, I'm Xavier Doorsberg, obviously. In case you don't know, the rest of the guys behind me, Kyle, B.J., and Jake. We want to congratulate you for making the final cut. Now, for the next couple of days, I'm gonna be your worst enemy. I'm gonna put the three of you through the wringer. But for one of you, at least, it's gonna be worth it. Now, we demand perfection. Perfect synchronicity, perfect harmony, perfect teeth, perfect abs. These people don't come and pay $100 a ticket to see you have a bad day on stage. So, what I want to see from you today is who's gonna try their hardest and who wants this the most. You know the song, you know the moves. It's up to you. How about you, buddy? You want to go first? - Let's do this. What's up, guys? - Let's not get too cozy. - Come on, whatever, man. Hey, I'm ready. - All right, you ready, man? - Yeah, let's do this. - All right, you've seen us on TV, so you know what to do. So, start off one, two, three, four. Bring your head up, five, six, seven, eight. Hit this on one. - Okay. - On two. And three, and four. - [Max] Okay. - You point five and six, seven, eight. Want to give it a shot with music? - Let's do it. (upbeat funk music) - Think he's got a shot? - Max? Yeah, he's good, man. He might even win this thing. - You sound okay with that. - (chuckles) Well, let's put it this way, man. I'm not gonna be up all night crying about it, I'll tell you that. - So how'd you end up here, then? - Girlfriend made me do it. You? - Girlfriend. - Yeah, girlfriend. (chuckles) - So, where is she, anyway? - She is back in the room. Alex wanted me to be focused, you know? - How long you been in the game? - Music? Since I was a kid. It's good. How about you? - Same here. Never thought I'd get my break this way, though. - Well, I'll tell you something. That could be a good thing, because maybe Max will win this thing and do us both a favor. (Jonah chuckles) You know? - What do you think? - (sighs) He's got potential. He's definitely got the right attitude. - Which, in this case, means none, right? - (chuckles) Exactly. We don't need somebody that's gonna make waves, or ask questions. We've got way too much riding on this. - I don't know, Xavier. I got my eye on Shawn. - (scoffs) The leather boy. - We can fix the wardrobe. He's got edge. And in my opinion, he's the best singer I've seen in years. - Edge means trouble. Edge is the wrong kind of attention. All right? Max is the least troublesome of the three, so we got to go with him first. Shawn can be our backup plan. - And what about Jonah? - In case Shawn's edge proves too sharp. (waves roaring) (gentle music) - You coming? - No, I'm gonna hit the hay. Stacy's waiting for me. Besides, where would we go, you know? - Those guys can't be all about the music, man. They got to have some way to unwind. I figure hang with them, see what makes them tick. Every little bit helps. - Not sure why you'd want me to go. - They're gonna want to see what makes you tick, find out your weaknesses. (both chuckle) - Yeah. (cellphone rings) - Oh, hang on. Hello? Hey, honey, how you doing? Yeah, can you hang on a sec? It's, uh, kind of a private call. Catch you later? - Sure thing, man. Take it easy, I'll see you tomorrow, man. - Thanks, man. - All right. - You still there? - I'm right here, honey. - Yeah, sorry, Fletcher. One of the other winners was here. He just left. - Good, so, how's it going? Dig up any dirt yet? - No, but I got my shovel out, and I'm about to go exploring. - How much do you think you'll get? - I don't know, but then, I never figured I'd get this far. - Well, obviously, I assigned the right man for the article. You know, I knew you were a good writer. I did not know you could sing, too. - (scoffs) Yeah, who knows? Maybe I'll switch careers. - Well, file your story first. - Yeah, don't worry about that. I'll need an extension on my deadline, though. - Take your time. Now that you're covering the band and not just the audition, I may give you the front cover. - That would be excellent. I'll talk to you later. (cellphone beeps) (cellphone beeps) (dramatic music) - [Jake] You don't think Max is the one? I mean, we sure could use someone with his talent. - [Xavier] Talent's only one factor, Jake. They all have qualities that make them worth it. - Yeah, well, as far as I'm concerned, the black guy's got to go. - What's the matter, B.J.? Afraid to change with the times? Isn't that what this trip is all about? - Look, who's ever heard of a white band with an African-American front man? I mean, it's bad enough we got this guy. (Jake laughs) - Excuse me? - What? - Hey, man. There's always Hootie & The Blowfish. - All right, everybody. That's enough, all right? Max stays. We treat him no differently than the others. If he proves worthy, he joins. If not... Besides, for what it's worth, Alex likes him. - So what is that worth? - Absolutely nothing, right? Let's go. (dramatic music) - And where might you be going on a night like this? (thunder rumbling) (tense rock music) (thunder rumbling) (crickets chirping) (dramatic ominous music) (water trickling) Looks like I found Take 10's private toy box. Well, well, well. Not as squeaky clean as we thought, are you? â™ª Ah, ah â™ª â™ª Ah â™ª (dramatic music) (water trickling) (phone beeping) (cellphone ringing) (ominous music) (cellphone beeps) - Hello? - Shawn, it's Jonah. - Hello. - Dude, you got to come down here and see this, man. - What are you talking about, Jonah? Where are you? - I'm out at this place by the beach, a cave. - Oh, well, that's, um, that's great, man. You got to hang out with the band, congratulations. - No, I'm alone, but there's some strange things happening here. - (scoffs) They're pop musicians, Jonah. They're supposed to be strange, you know? - No, man, you have to come down here and check this out. This is serious. - Yeah, I'm sure. So serious it can't wait till tomorrow, huh? - No, it can't. I'm thinking we should get out of here tomorrow. - Look, Jonah, you're trying to psych me out. It's not gonna work, all right? - That's not what this is about. - Okay, well, if it's all the same to you, I am gonna stay here and I am gonna hang out with Stacy. - You're not coming down? - No, no, I'm going to bed, man. You should probably do the same. (cellphone beeps) - [Xavier] Jonah. (ominous music) Jonah. (dramatic ominous music) - [Shawn] Stac, where'd you go? - Oh, I was just out for a walk. - - [Shawn] You went for a walk by yourself? - Yeah, you looked so cute. You were sleeping. I didn't want to wake you. (bright music) - (chuckles) Flattery will get you everywhere, that's for sure. Listen to me, I was worried, okay? - There's nothing to worry about. What did you think was gonna happen to me? - I don't know. I just got this call from Jonah. He was babbling about something down at the beach. Some big secret I should see. - Oh, let him babble. Let him lose sleep. You have another big day tomorrow. - That's right, I do. Come here and kiss me. (gentle music) Get some sleep. - Good night. (thunder rumbling) (dramatic ominous music) (phone beeping) - Answer, answer. (cellphone rings) - Jonah? (cellphone beeps) What's going on, Jonah? - You're not gonna believe this. - What did you come up with? - This is bigger than we thought. - [Xavier] Jonah. - I got to go, I'll call you later. - Jonah, Jo-- (cellphone beeps) - [Xavier] Jonah, Jonah. (dramatic music) - [Jonah] Hey, somebody, let me in! You guys couldn't sleep, either, huh? - We never sleep, Jonah. That's one of the secrets of our success. You want to know another one? Loyalty and honestly and trust. - That's three things, actually. - You've been a busy boy tonight. - Hey, man, I was just curious. - What exactly did you see, Jonah? - [Jonah] I didn't see anything! - You're not a very good liar, Jonah. That's half of being a successful singer, BSing your way through an interview. Don't you know that? - Jonah, Jonah, Jonah. Looks like you failed your audition. (Jonah groaning) (dramatic music) - Alex. - Goodbye, Jonah. - Look, if anything happens to me, I'll be missed. - Well, we'll just have to come up with a reason for your absence. (ominous music) - [Jake] Come here! - [Kyle] Me first. Tonight's the night your music dies. (band growling) (Jonah screaming) (upbeat rock music) â™ª Searchin' for a meaning, for reasons still unknown â™ª â™ª Life is so misleading, I wanna disconnect my phone â™ª â™ª I wanna run away far from here â™ª â™ª Find some way to make it clear â™ª â™ª I wonder why nothing's as it seems â™ª â™ª I wonder why I'm chasin' empty dreams â™ª â™ª It was only yesterday you said to me â™ª â™ª We're in this till the end â™ª â™ª I wonder why â™ª - What's up, Max? - Hey, what's goin' on, man? - Sleep well? - Yeah, 40 winks and then some. - So, uh, where's Jonah? - Uh, I have no clue. Maybe he got scared, couldn't handle the competition. - Yeah, exactly. - What's up, guys? - What's up, man? - The pressure is on. Jonah's out of the competition. - [Shawn] What do you mean, he left? - Let's just say, uh, he couldn't take the heat. - [Max] Yeah, but dude didn't even start yet. - Well, he got drunk last night, didn't show up this morning. Alex gave him the boot, and he wasn't arguing, so he's on the first flight out of here. - Didn't seem drunk. - You talked to him? - No, no, I meant, I meant that he just didn't seem like the irresponsible type, you know? - What's up with the hotties? (Xavier chuckles) - No, no, are they background singers? - Let's just say they're very dedicated fans. - [Shawn] Groupies, you mean. - No, they just keep the troops happy. Hey, if you ask them real nice, they'll probably break you off some candy. - Oh, sweet. - Anyway, Jonah's out, man. You're up. - Yeah, you know what, man? Can I keep my guitar, 'cause it might enhance my performance a little bit? (chuckles) - uh, yeah, I mind. No, I'm interested in your moves and your sound. That's it. - Let's get it on, let's go! - [B.J.] All right, let's get started. - [Shawn] Uh-huh. - Follow along, okay? - Sure. - Start off, you go five, six, seven, eight. You hit one. - Mm-hmm. - Get down low. - Okay. - Two and three and four. We got it. - Nice. - Five and six, seven, eight. Want to try it the music? - Rock on, let's go. - All right. (upbeat funk music) - Cut, cut, cut. - What, what now? - I think we're having a communication problem here. - [Shawn] Dude, it wasn't me, I was on. - [Xavier] Are you trying to blow this audition? - Nope, not consciously. - Well, maybe subconsciously, then, or maybe you want to join your buddy Jonah on the next flight out of here? - Yeah, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you? - [Xavier] (scoffs) Don't tempt me. - Your manager, you know, doesn't she have to, like, approve some sort of thing like that? You know, kicking me out of your big band you got here, right? - I'm pretty sure Alex would see our side of the story. You're up here trying to do your own thing, and there's no showboating in this band. Are we clear? - Crystal. - Yeah. See, like, uh, if you want to go start your own solo career or something-- - Okay, you know what? Let me tell you something, all you guys. Max is more your type of guy, so I suggest you bring him in here, let your guy, let him do your little dance, 'cause my audition's over. So you boys, you just rock on, all right? - Hey, man, that wasn't called for. (Xavier scoffs) (upbeat rock music) â™ª As long as you don't walk away â™ª â™ª As long as time don't go two ways, yeah â™ª â™ª So many times, you've gone too far â™ª â™ª And all that comes back annoys you â™ª â™ª I see all the answers â™ª â™ª Closing in, but still too far away â™ª â™ª I see all the answers â™ª â™ª And I hope you'll see them someday â™ª (thunder rumbling) (heartbeat thudding) (tense music) (Max moaning) (door clicks) - Oh, geez, man. What's up? - It's time, Max. (muffled shouting) (water trickling) What the hell? Hey, man, this isn't funny! Hey, you better cut me loose right now! - Shall we begin? - Yo, man, please, let me go. I will do whatever. - That's the idea, Max. Lie still, you won't feel a thing. (dramatic music) (Tyler growling) By Baal and by Carthis, I call upon thee. By Legban, by Zuul, I pledge my life to thee. - [Band] I pledge my life to thee. - Let this spirit merge with ours. - [Band] Let this spirit merge with ours. - Let our blood become one. - [Band] Let our blood become one. â™ª Ah â™ª (All growling) - Let our voices become one. - [Band] Let our voices become one. - Grant us his voice and his spirit. (dramatic whooshing) (all growling) - He survived. - Good, he passes the first test. - If he's the one, what do we do about Shawn? - He may have other uses. (B.J. laughs) (heartbeat thudding) (dramatic music) (crowd cheering) (upbeat funk music) (crowd laughing) (heartbeat thudding) (Shawn gasping) - Stacy. (dramatic music) - I'm your worst nightmare. (eerie music) - Stacy? Stacy! (tense music) Stacy! Stacy! (woman moaning) Stacy! Stacy! (woman moaning) Stacy! Stacy! (woman moaning) Stacy! Stacy! Stacy? Stacy? - Come join us, baby. It's time you became a team player. - Stacy, no, no! (dramatic music) (Shawn gasping) (gentle music) (seagulls squawking) Late night, huh? - Ah, I'm okay. - You sure? You didn't make it to 40 winks tonight this time, did you? - Bad dreams, man. - I know exactly what you mean, man. - I'm still gonna get the gig, though. - Yeah, you think? - (scoffs) As far as I can tell, you don't even want to be here. - You are a very observant man. - [Brunette] Sleep well, Kyle? - I am totally drained, I am so tired. - I should hope so. Otherwise, I'm not doing my job. - ]Tyler] Sounds like somebody ate his spinach. - Hey, how come I didn't get a wake-up call at 3:00 a.m.? - Man, I would do anything for that action. - Well, you know, you get the gig, I'm sure all you got to do is ask. - So ask. (dramatic music) Come on, I'll give you a personal introduction. - Man, I'm all for that. - Not joining us? - No, thanks, man. I'm outta here. You guys have a great time. See you later. (seagulls squawking) (dramatic music) - No, he'll be fine. I think he just deserves a chance. Yeah, I agree with you. I'll do anything I can to help, as long as you make it worth my while. (chuckles) I don't need any encouragement for that. God, I can't wait till I see you again. Wait, just a second. - Stacy. - I'll talk to you later. - Stacy. - Hey, how's my favorite rock star today? - I certainly, I certainly could be better. - Who were you talking to? - Oh, it was my mom. She was calling to see how the island was. - Yeah, what did you tell her? - I told her I was enjoying myself, but I'd be enjoying myself even more if you having fun, too. - Well, I'm not, Stacy. I want to split. I want us both out of here right now. - They haven't even picked anybody yet. - It doesn't matter, okay? They love Max. Besides, if I were those guys, I would pick Max, too, Because he wants it more, you know? - [Stacy] So you're just gonna give up? - Stacy, I don't want this. I'm only here for you and doing it for you. I have not been comfortable since I got here, And after what I've seen that's gone on, this is wrong, all right? - Shawn, don't throw this chance away. You got a shot most guys would kill-- - Stacy, you're missing one thing. You want this more than I do, okay? - I just want you to be successful. Why do you think there's any more to it? - That wasn't your mom on the phone, was it? - Wait a second. You're listening in on my phone conversations now? - Wait, let me ask you something, Stacy. Let me ask you something. Do you, I mean, do you really need me here? Do you? Because, I mean, you're after Alex, you know? - [Stacy] Wait, what are you accusing me of? - No, I've seen you with her, you know? - [Stacy] What! - I mean, you disappear at night, you're go-- - What! - I don't want this, okay! I don't want it you do! I want us out of here now! - [Stacy] What you need to do is think about what you're saying! Don't throw your life away, Shawn! - Oh, Stac, you know nothing about my life. You know that? Screw this. (upbeat music) - Are you really gonna be their new lead singer? - Oh, absolutely. - (sighs) You seem a little off. - Off? - I've been watching you, Max. I liked your energy. Maybe you've lost it now. - Well, maybe you're all I need to recharge my battery. (tense music) - Wow, what are you guys doing here? - (chuckles) Uh, we knew Max was gonna be here with you and wanted to see how he'd do in a band-friendly situation. - Anything for our fans. - Yeah, we're gonna have to teach little Max here the concept of sharing. (Kyle chuckles) - You can stick around if you like. I don't mind sharing. - Anybody care for an icebreaker? - (gasps) You plan on getting me drunk? - Yep. - Among other things. - Okay, guys, do you mind if we just chill here alone? - Actually, yeah, I mind. Max, if you want to be part of this band, you're gonna have to learn how to be a team player. - There's no I in team, right? - Oh, my god! You're right! There isn't. (guys laughing) - Wow, beauty and brains. - Oh, my god. You know, no one ever notices. What are they doing? - Don't worry, Amethyst. They just want to make sure you're nice and comfy. (upbeat funk music) - Mm, so, you guys actually make love to your own music? - Everybody makes love to our music. - Guys, y-- - Max, sit down! This involves you. - [Amethyst] Do you get first licks? - Actually, I'm more of a biter. (Amethyst moaning) Come on, Max. Join the dance. If you're gonna be part of this band, you're gonna have to learn to do as we do. - This is wrong, man, so wrong. - Max, she's all yours. You'll have any girl you want from now on, as long as you learn how to share. (heartbeat thudding) (dramatic music) (Xavier yells) - What's going on? - Damn, I should have warned you about the nails. - Oh, my god! What's wrong with you? - Looks like, uh, we need some touch-ups. - This is it, Max. This is where you become one of us. (Amethyst screaming) - No way, man. To hell with this. - No, buddy, from hell with this. (Amethyst screaming) (band growling) Do it. - Tastes like life, Max. Just give it a try. - Looks like this isn't gonna work out, Max. That's too bad. I really thought you were the one. Looks like some edge is what we need after all. (all growling) (ominous music) (Max screams) (tense music) - What the... What the hell is this place? â™ª Ah, ah â™ª - What the hell are you guys hiding? (ominous music) (heartbeat thudding) Oh, my god. And I held up. â™ª Ah â™ª (ominous music) 1967, how long have you guys been? How have they been doing this? 1956, No this, this is impossible. (dramatic music) (seagulls squawking) - [Alex] Shawn. How are we today? - Fine, Alex, you? - Oh, never better. We're just very close to a decision. - Thank you. Do I have to pass another audition, or are there other factors influencing your decision? - I'm sure I don't know what you mean. - Alex, Stacy around? Have you seen her? - Your girlfriend? - Yeah. - Yes, saw her a while ago. I think she headed toward the beach. - The beach, huh? - I assume so. You, uh, might want to go to her, Shawn. She seemed unhappy about something. - Couldn't imagine what that would be. - Oh, Shawn. I know you have a better imagination than that. Think about it. Think hard. (glass crashing) (gentle guitar music) (dramatic music) - [Jonah] Looks like I found Take 10's private toy box. - Jonah. - [Jonah] Not as squeaky clean as we thought, are you? - [Xavier] Just get rid of him, Alex. We'll figure out an official story later. - [Alex] I don't like this, Xavier. I didn't figure him for a troublemaker. What if Shawn presents a similar problem? Then we'll have no choice but Max. - [Xavier] What's wrong with that? - [Alex] I don't like having my hand forced. - [Xavier] We'll work on him, Alex and you can help. I see how you've been cozying up to his girl. - [Alex] She's the one cozying up to me. - Good, that means you can go. Oh, good, you're here. I got some exciting news for you. You're our new man. - What are you talking about, man? - I'm talking about Max packed up all his stuff and got out of here. He just didn't have what it takes. - [Shawn] No, no, there's no way. He wouldn't have just left. He wanted this more than any of us. - (chuckles) Yeah, well, wanting it isn't everything. It takes dedication. It was obvious after two days with us how worn out he was. I mean, after that last audition, he just couldn't cut it, I guess. You're not excited, man? Come on, you're our new lead singer. Congratulations. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. - That's, uh, yeah, that's, that's, that's great. I should probably tell Stacy. Where is she? You guys seen her? - No. - You got me. Anybody else seen her? - [Jake] Haven't seen her, man. - How about you, Alex? You seen her? - I just told you. Last I saw, she was headed toward the beach. - No, why don't you tell me, Alex, where she is, because you already told Xavier? - We'll work on him, Alex and you can help. I see how you've been cozying up to his girl. - [Alex] She's the one cozying up to me. - [Xavier] Good, that means you can go ahead-- - Now where is she, and what have you done with her? - (chuckles) Oh, Shawn. You just don't get it, do you? Girls love power. Money is power. That's what you seem-- - Haven't you figured out by now that I don't care about money or power? Haven't you guys all figured that out? All I want is Stacy! Now where is she! - I'm sorry, I honestly don't know where she is. Maybe she's abandoned us both. - Forget about her. (Shawn chuckles) You've got us now. We'll give you all you ever need. - What I need, you couldn't give me! - Let him go. We pretty much know where he's going. We left him a little surprise there. (dramatic music) - Hello, Shawn. - [Shawn] The hell are you doing here? - I hear you're the new lead singer, and I love breaking in new lead singers. You're kind of cute. - Yeah, you're kind of drunk. - (chuckles) Yeah, I'm kind of drunk, but I'm really horny. - That's great, that's great. Listen, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave right now. Please, leave, please. - But I've been waiting for you. - Okay, well, I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to keep waiting because I have to, I'm out of here, all right? - Oh, come on. I'll make you forget all about her. (dramatic music) - [Shawn] What the hell is this? - Trust me, Shawn. Rebecca's the best cure for a bad breakup. - Wait a second, wait a second. Whoever said we broke up in the first place, huh? - Come on, man. She's gone, forget about her. We're your future. - That's right. - Future, huh? Well, your future doesn't look so bright, now, does it, huh? - Don't resist, Shawn. We just want to see you perform. - Oh, so this is another one of your group efforts, right? - Not feeling generous today? We could have girls here if you don't want to share. - But we didn't want to overwhelm you on your first time out. - Come on, don't be shy. I don't bite, much. - No, I am not gonna sleep with her! - Of course not, sleeping comes later. - I said no! (blow thuds) - You're making this difficult, Shawn. (all growling) (ominous music) - Jesus! What the hell, what the hell are you guys? - [Xavier] What are we, Shawn? Do you really want to know? - God, I hate this cheap makeup. I wish we could switch to silicone. - It didn't have to come to this, Shawn, but you're gonna be our new front man whether you like it or not. - We need a new lead singer, a new sound. - How long's this been going on, guys? Huh, how long? - 50 years, you ever heard of Bobby Cooly and the C-Sharps? - Yeah, I just, I just found out about them tonight, yeah. - Oh, so you had a little history lesson. Not many people heard of us. We were on the verge of making it big. - Then our plane decided to crash, total bummer. - That was the day our music died, almost. Turned out our manager had some hidden talents, dabbled in the occult, so back we came. - All except Bobby. - He was unsalvageable. It's too bad, 'cause he was the one with the real talent, but our manager found a way to harness the talent of others. - Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. So, this is Alex's show, right? - Oh, no. Alex has only been with us since the Pseudo-Delic days. Our previous manager figured we literally owed him our lives and the money that went them, so we learned his secrets and let him go. Now we run the show. Alex works for us. She rides our gravy train. All she has to do is handle our business and find us the occasional new front man. - Um, guys, I think I'm gonna go now. - Shut her up, please. - No, no. (girl screaming) - Let her go! Let her go right now! Let her go! Oh, I see. I see something. This, this is, this is what happened to Max and to Jonah? Huh, am I right? That's what happened to them? - I'm afraid so. Jonah decided to play Columbo, And Max, well, Max resisted when the chips were down, so, it's on you now, Shawn. It's on you. - [Shawn] And if I don't, if I don't join? - Oh, you're gonna join us. You have no choice. We need you. - No, you don't, you don't need me. There's plenty of other guys out there. You don't need me. - The boy band thing's over now, Shawn. We're headed in a new direction, and you're gonna take us there. - And if I don't join, your plan is to kill me? Is that your plan? You're gonna kill me, huh? - Oh, no, we wouldn't do that. We'll just track down Stacy and kill her. - And then we'll kill your family. - No, no, no, no, not if I, not if I stop you, man. Not if I stop you. - I admit, it'd be fun to watch you try. It was when Gordo tried. (all growling) (tense music) (faces squelching) (all growling) (tense music) - [Xavier] Shawn. Come out, come on out. - [Jake] What's wrong, Shawn? Don't you like Xavier's new look? - [B.J.] Just one lousy ritual. After that, no more scary stuff, we promise. - Don't be a punk, Shawn. Just come out. - I like punk! (body squelching) (band laughing) - Oh, Shawn, you should know better than that. (dramatic music) - Going somewhere? - You gonna stop me, Alex? (band growling) Let go! Let me go! - We own you, Shawn. Pretty soon, you'll be ours, and then you won't even think about fighting. - Let go of me! Oh, what are you, what, what are you gonna, gonna do, Xavier? Huh, tough guy? Come on, what are you gonna do? (blow thuds) - (laughs) I owed you that. - Take him to the altar. I'm tired of waiting. I want this done tonight. - All right, come on, let's go. - [B.J.] Come on. - You gonna fix your face? - You don't like this look, Alex? - Reminds me of my mother. (ominous music) - You guys had time enough. What are you gonna do to me, huh? What do you think you're doing? Please let me go, please. - We're making the band, Shawn. We're making you one of us. - [Shawn] Damn it, Xavier! Please let me go! You think you can control me! Please let me go! Let me go right now, please! - It's like I told you before, Shawn. Soon, we won't have to, once you become one of us and see what we can do for you. - [Shawn] You think joining your band is what I want, is it? (groans) You think that's what I want? (Shawn groans) - If you didn't want it, you wouldn't be here. You expect me to believe you want to play music for yourself the rest of your life? Music is meant to be heard. You want the rest of the world to hear your music, and we can give you that chance. We need a new lead singer, and you need the fame, so it all works out. - You cannot get me that easily! I won't let you do it! Let me go right now! Please let me go! - Well, we'll see how you feel after you undergo our ritual. (Shawn grunting) - [Shawn] No, what, what is that? Please, no, please! - Just relax. - Wait! (band growling) - By Baal and by Carthis, I call upon thee. By Legban, by Zuul, I pledge my life for thee. - [Band] I pledge my life for thee. - Let this soul merge with ours. - [Band] Let this soul merge with ours. - Let our blood become one. - [Band] Let our blood become one. (dramatic music) (all growling) - Let our voices become one. - [Band] Let our voices become one. - Grant us his voice and his spirit. - [Band] Grant us his voice and his spirit. - Stop it, let him go. - Stacy, I was looking for that. And here I thought you'd left me, sweetheart. - Alex, I'm not your sweetheart. For someone in the music industry, you're pretty easily fooled. Now, untie him. - Oh, I don't think I will. You seem to be slightly outnumbered. - The crossbow makes up for a lot. Any of you want to try me? - Sure. Take your best shot, and I'll take my best stab. - (scoffs) Is that what you killed my brother with? - Your brother? - My half-brother, Gordo McSteel. You know him, don't you? I found this. He left it to remember him by. - Yeah, of course I know him. I also know his sister's name was Linda. - We all take fake names when we have to. Do you think my mother really named him Gordo? His real name was Leslie. - Good. Now I know what name to put on your tombstones. (arrow thuds) (Xavier grunts) Wow, a heart shot. Pretty impressive for a woman. Sorry, Stacy, this is a boys' club. No girls allowed. (Stacy gasps) - I hate boy bands, man. (all growling) (all screaming) (dramatic music) (ominous music) - You're gonna kill me, too? - I need you now, Alex. (brakes screeching) - While it didn't happen the way I hoped, at least you got inside. - Jonah was talented, but not cunning enough. - Well, that's why I hired you, as well, dear. Now, remember, we are not ready to break any kind of story yet, so keep a lid on it until we are good and ready. - Or, at least, until we find another band. Besides, boy bands are out. We need to think more solo act. - Ah, Stacy, that's what I love about you. Stick with me, kid. I've got big plans for us. (clicks tongue) Ciao. - Ciao. (audience applauding) God, do you hear that crowd out there? This is really happening. Aren't you excited? - Well, I'm excited, I'm nervous, the whole nine. But I could have thought of an easier way to get famous, you know what I mean? - hey, that's all behind us now. We're focused on the future, right? - Absolutely, but there is one more thing. Take a seat. When I, uh, when I get out there, I want to, uh, I want to dedicate a song to Gordo, okay? - God, that's sweet, Shawn. That means so much to me. - You know, if you think about it, we wouldn't have even been together if it weren't for you trying to, you know, figure out his death. - Hey, hey, then I wouldn't have met the man I truly love, who I wanted to be with even before that audition. - Come here. (chuckles) Looks like you need a touch-up. (ominous music) All right, there you go. We're getting there. (chuckles) There, it's all fixed. - Thanks. I'll be in the front row, okay? Save that ballad for me. - I promise you. See you out there. (Shawn chuckles) (audience applauding) Here we go, huh? It's what you wanted. - [Announcer] The amphitheater proudly presents. - Let's do it. - [Announcer] Recording star super sensation, making his live-concert debut, Shawn Walker!
