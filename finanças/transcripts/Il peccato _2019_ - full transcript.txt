Early XVI century. The celebrated sculptor Michelangelo Buonarroti is carrying out commissions for Pope Julius II, head of the Della Rovere family and the most powerful man in Italy. The Medici, an affluent Florentine bloodline long locked in a bitter rivalry with the Della Rovere, are eagerly anticipating the prevailing Pope's demise in order to take control of the Holy See and, in turn, the whole country. Soon thereafter, Medici Pope Leo X sits in the Vatican, and Michelangelo is forced to pick sides. Does he stay with the Della Rovere or bow to the Medici, the new rulers of the land? Florence, wicked and mean you are... but still I can't wait! You expect a declaration of love. You! You are only the graveyard of my love, my dreams, my inspiration! I won't be the first one... how many people have you ruined already?! All of them, all of us loved you, and you betrayed us all. Dante was banished "from that ungrateful people that deprives only the righteous." Florence, what is the reason for your pride? Why should I love you? What did you do to the ones who loved you? Ficino, Poliziano, Pico della Mirandola... What did you learn from them? Freedom? Reason? Stop making fun of me. You are a whore! What else could one expect from you? Let me say... betraying the ones that came to rescue you was easy for you. You only care about everything staying the same: the poor keep starving and living in misery... and the rich keep lazing and living in luxury... while you want to stay the most... beautiful city in the world forever. And may anyone ever disagree! You're poisonous, and your poison is sublime. FLORENCE Father... Michelangelo, you're always late. Poor uncle, he was so skinny. Holy Mary... are you sick? Father, I never come down from the scaffolding. I work nights, too. I am afraid of dying before I can finish the work. This is the kitchen. This is the workshop. And then you go up to the first floor. - Do you like it? - Yes. And this is the bedroom. You'll see how bright it is. At least it doesn't smell like tanners here. What else is for sale? They're selling two other small houses on Ghibellina Street... and then a big farmstead in Settignano. It has an olive grove... and... a great vineyard... on the... southern... side... of the hill. - Buy, buy! - It's almost 3000 florins. Buy now! I'll borrow some money from Balducci's bank. And the Pope owes me a lot of money for Sisto's Vault. If the Spaniards come... - or if the Medici come back to Florence... - It's impossible, you're wrong! - It's possible! - Holy Mary... it's impossible! It's possible, trust me. If the Medici come back to Florence, everything will be double the price in Tuscany. Buy, buy... and put everything in our father's name. Did you hear that, Father? Everything in your name. One... two... three... Can you please sign for the 720 florins you withdrew from your account? Let's finish counting first. ...seven... eight... After the transfer of money to Mr. Tommaso's trustee, the house will officially be property of Mr. Lodovico, your father. Lionardo, what are you doing there? Help us. Come here. How much money is left in my account? - 18 florins. - 18 florins? How's that possible? There should be around 300. There you go. Last October, your brother, Mr. Buonarroto, withdrew 23 florins. Last December, with your letter of delegation, Mr. Lodovico withdrew 149 florins. Father! Buonarroto! Rain came through the roof in the previous house... we needed money to fix it. And Gismondo was very ill. We had to pay the doctor. You wrote that we were free to withdraw as much money as we needed. I wrote that you could take the money only in extreme circumstances. I work like a slave for your own good. I live off bread and water, like a beggar! I am sick, much worse than you! I saw the butcher bringing you ham... You eat meat every day! You drink wine! - And nice jacket, by the way! - Take it, I don't need it! I don't need it anymore. I'll give you all the money back. Take this jacket! Take this jacket... Father, don't be ridiculous! You all live off my money, and I'm the only one working! You do nothing but spend money! How dare you raise your voice to your father! You'll burn in hell. For the love of money, you're insulting your father, and you forgot the fourth commandment: "Honour your father and your mother!" Here is the truth. The truth of the great Savonarola. Holy Mary! Lionardo, where did you get that? That's a forbidden book! Put it away immediately, or we'll be handed over to the Inquisition! Sins rule the world! Son against father, brother against brother! You're afflicted by greed. The golden veal is your idol! You're pigs of Epicuro's herd! God will come and punish us for all of our sins! The Last Judgement is about to come, and the world will be filled with lamentations! Don't touch it! Don't touch it! Go away, old man! You've always been stingy with me. How dare you lay hands on your father! You'll burn in Hell! Let me go! Let me go! Michelangelo, do something! Can't you hear them? Michelangelo... Michelangelo... can you see how they treat me? They take all your money and don't give anything to me. All of you hate me! You think I am the black sheep of the family, that I am no good! Kill me, then! Kill me and throw my body in the Arno! Come on, Giovan Simone. Don't say these things. I know that deep inside you're not a bad person. Lionardo... says... I'll burn in Hell... Will we really all burn in Hell? FLORENCE Witch! What are you cackling about? Tell me... tell me now! Tell me! Where are you? VATICAN What a shame... What a shame... If then I also got the proportions wrong in the second part... we'll have to take off all these frescoes. Damn it! I'm tired of living in Rome. At every step I take, there is a priest, a pilgrim, or a prostitute. Enough! Wine here sucks! And the air is corroding my lungs. How can one picture a perspective if you can touch the ceiling with your nose? You can only imagine what effect it will have on the ones below. Another year... I need another year. I need to redo everything again... I haven't finished. I won't let you pass. Michelangelo, you've been repeating the same thing for a year. His Holiness warned you: first at Christmas and then at Easter. Now the Pope has lost his patience. He'll come here at midday with the entire conclave to see the chapel. and the Commission has to see your work before the Pope's arrival. - Let us through. - No. The Holy Inquisition is responsible on behalf of the Pope for the religious content of frescoes. We haven't forgotten all the problems with the Heaven fresco where Eve is pointing at Adam's scrotum with her nose. I still can't look at the ceiling! Let us through. It's not that bad. And the Pope liked it! Does it mean that... he trusts me and the Inquisition does not? The Inquisition doesn't trust anyone! That's why they call us Hounds of the Lord. Bitches of the Lord. How dare you speak to the Holy Inquisition this way! - Let us through. - He's drunk. Michelangelo... let us through. No. You can't decide whether I have finished my work or not. Raffaello, where are you? - Raffaello? - Here, your Eminence. Raffaello, whom the Pope trusts completely, says he went up the scaffolding to check, and everything is fine and ready. - Raffaello... - I couldn't say no to his Holiness! And I couldn't deny myself the pleasure of being the first one to see your work. - Shame on you! - Enough! Where are you going? Stop! Stop! Go in and start taking apart the scaffolding. Stop! I'll take apart all of this! The scaffolding must be removed by midday. - Michelangelo, wash yourself! - I'll take down this infamous scaffolding myself! Curse you, stop! I'll take it apart. - Stop, stop! - Michelangelo... The Pope ordered you down from the scaffolding! Michelangelo, go get some sleep and come back at midday to meet the Pope! Come on! Good! Finally, I'll be able to get away from this city of pilgrims and whores. You've convinced the Pope to take apart the scaffolding! - No, Michelangelo... - And now you are here to make fun of me! Michelangelo, what are you talking about--? You are the one stealing ideas from me, from Leonardo, from Perugino! You have no ideas of your own! That's not true, I steal only your ideas! Michelangelo, wait! Stop! You're the best, I admire you! Go away! Go away! Thief! Thief! You are always surrounded by your ass-lickers! And you are always alone like an executioner! Lunatic! He's crazy. - But he is completely crazy. - He was always like this. - And is he always so dirty? - Yes, he doesn't wash himself. Master! Master! Master? Finally! Here you are! Come! The Pope is enthusiastic! Everyone admires your work! They say it's divine! - Divine? - Yes! There is only one divine in Italy, and he's called Dante Alighieri! And now you are too, Master. It was the Pope himself who said it. Divine, Master, divine! You are the best! Better than Raffaello, better than Leonardo! - Let's go to the Pope. - No, no... He's very pleased! He was about to cry when he saw your work. Let's go, come on! And what is he saying? Eh? Where is he? He's really happy, really happy! He says you are divine! - Me? - Yes! Can you hear that? It's him still cawing. Now I'm definitely not going out to disgrace myself. No! Master, they are already saying this is the best thing that has ever been created in Italy, the best in the world! Everyone is saying that! - Really? - Yes! Out of the way! Let the great Michelangelo pass! Stand up. Divine! Divine! I told you that you would do it. ROME So?! Don't you like it? Master, we've been stuffing ourselves with stockfish for 3 months now. Is this even fish? We're eating salt. I don't have money for better food. I eat it, and that's it. And I don't complain! Yesterday he ate at Palazzo Caprini, with Raffaello's apprentices. He ate lamb, and drank good wine... With Raffaello? Pack his stuff. Get out! Why do you treat him like this? He's just a boy. You can get out too! I asked you for blue shirts, and you brought me the grey ones! The old beans you sent me gave me diarrhoea! Are these even real problems? Get out! Get out! Go, go! Go to your Raffaello! - Get out! - He'll be happy to have a moron like you! What problems are you making up? Blue, grey... It was about time! You did the right thing, Master. In Germany, we would have sent him away already. Master Durer wouldn't have taken him in his workshop. Forgive me. I have a bad temper, I know. Come on, come inside! Come! Why do you go to Raffaello? Raffaello doesn't know anything about sculpture. You've got talent. Only I can teach you. That's not true. That's not true. Come! Why do you go to Raffaello? Look, what do you want to eat? Tell me! - Lamb? - No. - Pork? - No, rabbit. Rabbit. Tomorrow we'll have rabbit. Your Holiness... Your Holiness! Don't worry... keep working. I'm here just to have a look. Where are the statues? And my memorial? I told you it's not finished yet. You're making fun of me! Your Holiness... I'm doing my best. I would have finished already if I didn't have to take care of Sisto's Vault. This commission that you wanted so much cost me five years of my life. Five! And now I'm being reproached as if I was a little boy. Did your father hit you? And I hit you... as if you were my son. You need half a year for a statue. When will it be ready? There are 48 statues in total! - When will you finish them? - It's true, your Holiness. I'll never finish your tombstone! I... I have no sense... of boundaries. I'm unable to control myself. My every project goes beyond my strength. It seems alive! How do you do that? I don't know... I don't know... it comes out naturally. And because of this, you'll be forgiven. Come on, give me your hand! Get up and keep working. Come with me. Pope Giulio is dying... I need to go! VATICAN ROME Excellent. - What do you think. Your Eminence? - I have no words. It's divine. Fine. Is there anything else to see? Where are the other statues? Sorry, I got distracted. Where are the other statues? Your Eminence, I will start shortly with the statues of Cybele and of Heaven-- Really? Only one statue?! The Pope, your uncle, distracted me with the Sisto's Vault project. - Otherwise I would have finished sooner! - Michelangelo, listen to me carefully! The Medici are in the Vatican now. They now rule Italy. Everything's changed. Now that the Pope is a Medici, anything could happen. They might even stop us from putting the grave inside St. Peter's. All of us, heirs of Pope Giulio, the whole Della Rovere family, have sworn that the will of the Pope will be satisfied and that he will be buried wherever he wanted. And we'll do it as soon as possible. You don't have to worry about it! Michelangelo, be honest with yourself and with us. What was the agreement? When do you have to finish? - In 3 years. - 3 years? 40 statues... He will be dead before that! 20 will be enough. Maybe 10 will be enough... We have to create a new project. Great idea! I'll prepare the project and leave for Carrara to look for the marble. When will you leave? When I receive the money. What? The money that His Holiness gave me for his tomb ran out long ago. Your Grace, when the Pope commissioned me his tomb, we had to spend thousands of ducats on marble alone. The Pope ordered to give me this money and sent me to Carrara, where I stayed for 8 months. I bought a donkey and a horse. Here... I paid 12 soldi to square the blocks. It's all written here in my account! Why is there no mention of the new house you bought in Florence on Mozze street? And what about the farmstead in Settignano? For which you paid 2000 florins using His Holiness' money? How can you... know all of this? - It was my father... - Master, we know everything. Michelangelo... on the 11th of February, under His Holiness' name, you were given 6000 florins. On the 14th of February, you sent this money to Florence. On the 23rd of February, the house under your father's name was bought. In March, you bought the farmstead. Greed is a deadly sin. You'll burn in Hell. You're accusing me... I was working in Florence when the Pope called me. I lost 3000 ducats... and I didn't receive this money for 2 years! When I asked him for some money, he ordered to send me away. How much do you need? How much money? I don't need anything from you. Here... 1200 ducats. We'll give you additional 5000 at Easter. We'll prepare a new contract. You won't take any other commissions until you finish the tomb! And remember.... You're a scoundrel... but you're a divine scoundrel. A genius. That's why we are bearing with you. Don't touch it. You haven't paid all the money yet. You have 3 years! What a shame... what a shame! How can the Della Rovere know about the new house? Who told them? It was someone from Florence... Or it was the man from the bank... Yes-- no-- it was someone from my family... - It was Giovan Simone-- - Forgive me Master, it was me! - You? - They tortured me! - That Saracen man! It was horrible! - No... Peppe, no! He wanted to know everything: your commissions, how much money you had received... I didn't say anything, anything! Master, they put me by force in a bag and they threw me into the river! I was about to drown! Send me away, Master. Send me away... No... you'll stay. You'll stay... and you'll work like a slave. Like a chained slave. We have only 3 years. CARRARA You damn raven! You managed to find me here as well. Master, they have their own ravens in Carrara! They are from Carrara! I crossed the same mountains to get to you from Nuremberg. Yes, but you have never seen such beautiful marble. Look! Look at that! Look at that! These idiots, damned sons of a bitch! Look at what they did to me. They'll make me lose the block. Come on, pull! Come on! You bastards, look at that. Look at that! Pull! Pull harder! Bastards! Motherfuckers! Sons of a bitch! - Sansovino! - Michelangelo! Look at what they did to me! I'll lose the block. Come on, pull! Pull! Michele! How are things going? All good, Master! Can't you see what they've done? - So what's good? Fucking nothing. - These morons can't do anything. I told you that. And now it'll take me a week to get a new wagon, and the boat is already in the port! - It's as white as sugar. Where is it from? - Polvaccio. Now, how can I save the marble block? - And these fucking sheep! - I told you we needed a new wagon. If he had told you, why didn't you listen to him, you idiot? Go fuck yourself, both of you! I'm the owner and the one who pays, and you don't talk to me like this. Understood? Come on, go to work. Go! We have to make space. Come on! I made a mistake. Doesn't this ever happen to you? - So what? What are you doing there? - What the fuck do you want? - I have my wagon there. Wake up! - Go fuck yourself! - You need to wake up! - Shut up! - You're always the same! - Enough... enough! You don't need to call anyone. - Take off the other wheel. - And then? And then you put the shield as you do with lists and then pull. Bravo Master! Topolino and Caciucco, take the shields. Come on, change the wheel. Now I have to pay three times more... but I'm happy to see you, Michelangelo! Yes, I'm happy too. I won't listen to you anymore. You always do things your way. If you come to the restaurant, we'll eat together, Michelangelo! Yes, I had to meet you here, too. CARRARA Marquis Malaspina's castle The Marchioness and I are very happy because of your stay in Carrara. The Marchioness... will join us soon. She's very excited! I'm sure you came because you have to start a big project. I need to find some marble for Pope Giulio's tomb. The dear departed Pope was a well-known member of the Della Rovere family. Not all of the Della Rovere are good people... but when compared to the Medici... You certainly know the story of this castle, don't you? Master? I am sorry. You surely heard that the great Dante passed many happy hours of his life here. Sure, your Grace, sure. Master! I am very happy! Please, take a seat. I was talking to our well-known guest about the great Dante, who spent 2 weeks in this abode. My doctor doesn't let me go out at night, but the Marchioness will be happy to take you around the wing we generally do not open to the public. I didn't dare ask you, your Grace. For sure, a genius like you can also stay in the room of the divine Dante Alighieri, and sleep in his bed! I couldn't hope for anything better! Follow me, please. Come, Lila. He used to come here to admire the moonrise. This is a weird place, don't you think? I am sorry. They say you know the Divine Comedy by heart... No, only Inferno. He was afraid of assassins. Did you know that he was sentenced to death? There is a secret door in his room that leads to a tunnel and allows you to escape to the mountains in case of danger. Is it here? Yes. I would have never allowed anyone but you to sleep in this room. I think you understand. The secret passage to the mountain is through that door. I understand. I'll leave you alone. Your Grace... your generosity-- I hope you find what you're looking for. Where are you? Where? Where can I find you? Where are you? I feel you here... Let me see you... "Through me you pass into the city of woe. Through me you pass into eternal pain. Through me among the people lost for aye. Justice the founder of my fabric moved. To rear me was the task of power divine, supremest wisdom, and primeval love. Before me things create were none, save things eternal, and eternal I endure. All hope abandon, ye who enter here." Hey, you! - Who are you? - I'm Michelangelo! What are you doing up there? I don't know! Oh Nenin, do you have a better chisel? Master... why did you come up here? I want to see this block. You managed! Master! You're here at last! You took a long time. Do you remember Dino? - The child that was always in my way? - Yes, it's him, Master! - Look how big he is now... - Look at him. It's about to fall! Good job, guys! Did you see that, you moron? Is it broken? You're a failure, shut up. You lost the bet! We had a bet. It's not broken. - I don't have the money. - You have to pay! You're an imposter! You're an imposter! You have to pay! Listen! What's going on, Master? What's going on? Master, what's up? Damn it! Why is he so angry? Do not pay attention. Don't you know him? Give me this book. Put... your... finger... up... my... ass, dear... old... man-- Give me that. Put your finger up my ass, dear old man-- Who writes this stuff? Wait... ...and push your dick inside slowly. Lift your leg and play well, and then hit me without restraint. Did you understand what he's saying? I want this dick... not a treasure! This is what can make me happy! This is a dick for an empress! Who writes this stuff? - I don't know. - Aretino. - Who's this Aretino? - A great poet from Tuscany. Is that right, Master? He's really a shitty poet. I like him. Wine, wine! There's Aretini... Arrogant... all of them are sodomites! If for the sarcophagus you take the block that is 5 aunes long and 3 aunes deep, it means that for the Virgin Mary, a block of 4 aunes won't be enough. I've told you already, the Virgin Mary's height has to be the same as the sarcophagus' length. Yes, Master, yes. So... It's possible... - Catch me, run! - Come here! Run, run! - Who is that? - I don’t know. Ah, Maria. The daughter of the foreman. What a joy to see her. So... noble and praiseworthy. She appeared to me 10 years ago, for the first time, but back then, I could only see her with the eyes of my soul, and now she is here. She wakes up the spirit of my life that resides inside my heart... and now it's pounding so hard... It's the providence who's sending me this creature, this divine beauty. She is beautiful, isn't she? Maria! Are you there? Go get some water! Is she your daughter? - Yes. - I want her to be my model. If you go to Carrara, you'll find a lot of models. Please... I'll pay you! I need to ask my wife. She makes the decisions. What a nice ass! I'm really lucky, really. Because now you are busy with the Pope's grave, otherwise they would have given this work to you. I got the contract instead. And Pope Leo signed it! I am as happy as a pig in muck! Have you got any idea of how tired I was of copying the masters of the past? Now this work is giving me new possibilities. It's everything I've ever dreamt of. And I will work in Florence! I can't stand Rome anymore. How do you like it there? Fine... but only if I can work with marble. Bring us some more wine! A big jug! I'll show you the sketches. Wait... - So? Do you want to see them? - Sure. Here. This is one of them. Who's the architect? Sangallo. I'll only take care of the statues. Yes, I know what you're thinking. They all look like roasted chickens. No, I am not thinking this. Damn it! It's nothing. Good wine is good for drawings. So? Be honest. I am not going to get offended. Come on! You don't have that thing. That thing! Nobody. None of you. Leonardo, Raffaello, Perugino, Pinturicchio... but you especially. You're all as rancid as curdled milk. You lack strength... Titanic strength! You lack force. You shouldn't do this job. You don't understand anything about sculpture. You're mediocre, without talent. Maybe you're right, but the Pope doesn't have the same opinion! Boys, come with me! - Go away, woman, go away! - Then I'll come with you. Go fuck yourself, go! Do you know how surprised I was that you accepted my invitation to eat with me tonight? I don't know. My melancholy... I felt like talking to someone. Be careful! Dickheads! Look at these sons of a bitch. Yes, melancholy, Michelangelo... I feel this melancholy too. This is the fate of great artists! - Look, dogs... - Stay still... Don't run away or they'll attack us. - You sure that they are dogs? - We need to take a torch. - They are afraid of fire. - I'm not afraid of dogs. I'm afraid of demons. Are you sure these are simple dogs? It's the devil! It's a demon! The devil has been chasing me for 5 years... 5 years! Thank God I followed you, Michelangelo! Otherwise, they would have torn you to pieces. Look at you. You're filthy. What did I do? The sign was there. - I told you to cut it up there! - But the sign is there! I want this. Yes, this is a beautiful block, but... That is for Sansovino. - Has he paid already? - No. I'll give you more. 50 florins more. 50 florins? - Does it seem like a little amount to you? - Who has ever seen them? - I've never seen them in my life. - It's a lot. Sansovino wants it in 4 pieces. How many pieces do you want? I want it as a whole. This one is crazy. Are you drunk? I want it as a whole! You have to take it down like this. It will be the biggest block in Italy. - You are completely insane! - I'm scared. Did you see a comet yesterday? A comet with a tail. I saw it. It was a sign of luck, and it will bring happiness to all of us. He's crazy! Yes, I am! And I will give each one of you 2 more florins on top of what I promised! - Two florins? - Two! Big ones? Are you kidding me? Can you shut up? I'm trying to work here. It corresponds to a year of work. It's a lot of money... but we have to be careful. This is not a joke. It's too big. We have never transported such a big block. The usual tools won't be enough. We'll need 50, 100 men to take it down. I'll make the calculations and I'll order everything you need. I'll take full responsibility. It's too big to carry! But I think it's possible. It's heavier than 50 wagons! I don't know about 50, but 30 for sure. This is not a block, it's monster! Yes, it's a monster! So what do you say? Do you agree? Do you think you are the only crazy one around here? Michele, I'm fine with it. - Fine. - Fine. Hooray for the monster! - Can you please shut up? - You never change. Go on with that rope. Pass me the rope, come on. Use the rope there. Come here, help me. Leave that, bring this stuff up there. First I have to go up. Go up with the rope, it's safer. Michele, do you think these pyros are OK? - They're big. - No worries, they're fine. And they're square, bad quality. You're crazy. No worries, they're fine. The tools are fine, bring them up. They're fine and that's it! - I told you you're a failure! - Don't worry about this, they're fine. Enough! You're like your aunt. You're scared. - You're crazy! - They're fine! - No! - They're all right! Mum was right, you're a bad person. Stay out of this! - Enough, enough! - Take that stuff up with you. You quarrel all the time! I've checked already, but I would like you to have a look. Yes, fine. Is it strong enough? You should know about that, Master. You did the calculations. So you are not sure? Don't count your chickens before they are hatched. Master! Let's tighten this in the meantime. This is Giannone, the blacksmith. Master, everyone in Carrara is talking about you and about the "monster." That's why I came to have a look. I bought the ropes from Berto in Pisa. 520 libs. Tomorrow, I'll receive the pulleys from Florence. I want to give you the responsibility of the anchorage. Here are the drawings with all the instalments. - There is an extra fixing here. - Yes. Can you do it? Yes, it's possible, but it will cost more. I'll give you 12 soldi. You should be glad. VATICAN Open! Let people go! This is not Pope Giulio's tomb. This is a monument to the vanity and insatiability of the Della Rovere. Do you think we'll let you install this marble mountain inside Saint Peter's? Thank God now the Medici are in the Vatican. Thanks to the Medici, Florence got up off its knees. The Della Rovere can be angry, but there's nothing they can do. That's it. How much did they pay you? Your Holiness, I swear on the Virgin Mary that neither my family, nor my father, nor my brothers ever said a word against the Medici family! Michelangelo, stand up. Stand up now and calm down. You've been part of our family for as long as I can remember. We've always eaten tripe together at the same table. Stand up now. Romans have gone crazy. They keep bothering my Annone all day. He ran away because he was scared. Have you seen my elephant? It's a gift from the king of Portugal. Have you seen my elephant? Forgive me, Your Holiness. I got distracted. So, how much did the Della Rovere pay you? 20,000 ducats. Michelangelo, don't exaggerate. They couldn't have given you more than 12,000. But that is not the point. I think you don't have to keep your commitments. Think about your supreme duty, instead. Do you remember how much our father did for you? He was like a father for you too, wasn't he? I'll never forget Lorenzo The Magnificent. My gratitude towards him knows no bounds. We want to complete San Lorenzo's facade in his memory. I know, Your Holiness. Jacopo Sansovino told me. Yes, it was Sansovino who reminded us of you. We want you to finish the facade. It's your duty. Your Holiness... I don't have the right. My contract with the Della Rovere states that I cannot accept other commissions. I think we'll be able to persuade the heirs of Pope Giulio. No, I can't... So you don't want to do it... - Then I'll have to call Raffaello. - Raffaello?! Raffaello? He doesn't know anything about sculpture. He took from me everything he managed to do! It's you who are refusing. If you... could persuade the Della Rovere to delay the contract for 4 more years... Trust me. So, is this a deal? Your Holiness... I have just found some marble as white as sugar! The facade will be the mirror of the whole of Italy! But I need marble... a lot of marble. - So, do you agree? - Yes. One more condition: I'll do everything on my own. I don't want help from anyone. Neither Sansovino nor Sangallo, nobody. They would only be a hindrance. I work better on my own. Michelangelo, arrogance is a grave sin. Anyway, if that's what you want, take your tomb and go back to work. Thank you. - Your Holiness... - Uncle! - What happened? - Della Rovere... What's happening, Giulio? I galloped all night long from Piacenza to bring you this letter! Lorenzo, shut up. Your uncle was talking. And so? Lorenzo came from Piacenza. He intercepted a letter from the Duke of Urbino. "Letter of Francesco Maria Della Rovere, Duke of Urbino, to his Christian majesty, Francesco, King of France!" What's written in there? It was me who intercepted that letter! - The Duke of Urbino is a traitor, Uncle! - Lorenzo, shut up. So? He wants to convince the king of France to start a war against us. Della Rovere, what a lowlife! We have to put an end to this. That's what I was saying, need to take their duchy now! Lorenzo, I've told you already: shut up! He's our Michelangelo. We have no secrets from him. Lorenzo... Is a Swiss regiment enough to send the Della Rovere away from Urbino? Yes, sure. Fine. I'll issue an edict against Francesco Maria. So, Lorenzo... you need to occupy Urbino. You'll be the new Duke! Your Holiness, can I go? Go, go! Your Holiness, my contract with the Della Rovere... Go! We have discussed everything with you already. Giovan Simone! Giovan Simone! Michelangelo! The elephant! The elephant! It's beautiful! It came from India! - I'll come back here tomorrow! - No, you'll go home tomorrow. - Home? - It's sure now. They'll poison me. Who? Run! Let's see the elephant! We need to put an end to this story once and for all! Yes, Your Holiness... The Della Rovere family must be sent away from Urbino immediately. How much will the mercenaries cost? URBINO Come on! The first one will be beheaded! Lorenzo... come down and take your sword... Let's face each other as honest men! We'll do it another day, Francesco. Not today. I won't fight against men with their butt cheeks out. Come down! Come down! Go away! Go away! And thank God I won't kill you for betraying the Holy See, and won't imprison you in Castel Sant'Angelo! What? Eminence, will you let the traitor go? Yes... but first bring some trousers to the ex-Duke of Urbino. And also a horse! Look at how cute he is with trousers on! Do you want a little shirt as well? Tell me who is the traitor... - Who opened the door? - Don't worry yourself, Francesco. He's dead already. Soldiers! Clear the way for the ex-Duke of Urbino! Remember Medici, we will come back! CARRARA Everything is fine. So, men! You know what I'm about to say. We're about to do a job we've never done before. It's the first time that such a thing has ever been done. This is not a block, it's a monster, and we need to be careful. Is this clear? Let's go to work. Keep your eyes open. Yes, let's go! Let's start. Come on guys, let's start with the lintels. Come on, quickly! Come on, hurry up! Get out of the way! Keep it up! Come on, we're almost there! It's beautiful, Peppe! I'm trying to reproduce your great ideas, Master. The Medici family should be grateful for this work, Master. Is there anything wrong, Master? All this beauty... for some whoremongers, tyrants and assassins! They don't deserve my creations, and I'm only an old monster. You know what, Master? It's true you're not beautiful, but you're a genius. "Nature gives a noble soul to a mean body," said Pampinea. Did you say Pampinea? - I-- no... - Pampinea? You read Boccaccio! Which Boccaccio? How can you know Pampinea? It's a character in the Decameron. I don't know... You just quoted the Decameron by Boccaccio. No, no-- I haven't quoted anyone. Am I going crazy? You lied... you lied when you said you couldn't read Italian properly! Master, no... you heard something... Who sent you?! Who sent you? Master, I've been with you for 8 years now! How curious... How curious... fools get burned in a fire or frozen in ice... - For God's sake, there are people here! - There are people there! If this monster falls, it will kill them all. Dino! Do me a favour. Ask those people to go behind the ravine. Why me? This is my first descent. Because I decide here. Leave him alone, it's his first descent. Toto, you go. - Why me? - Do you want me to go? - Bollocks! - I don't know... Fine, I'll go. Thank you, Angelotto. So you can tell your girls about your first descent. Let's start. Let's wait a little bit. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Come on guys, we need help! Come on, let's go! Stay back! Stay back! Come on, let's go! You see? They lasted. The monster is about to come down. Stay back, it's dangerous. - Yes, come on! - Let it go! Let it go! - It's going to the left. - Shut up, stop it! - Come here! - Pull! Go there, go there! - It's going to the right. - Shut up! Lift it carefully! Lift it carefully! Put the pyro in. Give me that palisade. - Come on! - Dino, go inside. Come on! Dino! Up, up! Angelotto! - He's dead! - What? He's dead! He's dead! It's my fault. The calculations were right. This piece broke... it's made of air and charcoal. It's really bad. - Let me see. - That blacksmith... Betrayal... and disgrace are here, too. Piece of shit... he's a piece of shit! I'll make him swallow this hook! Son of a bitch! Infamous Giannone. I trusted him! I trusted him! Son of a bitch! Master! - Master, let's wait one more week! - Don't touch me! Master! Please, let's wait one more week! Go away! Laura! We have problems. Whore! You're a whore! - Shame on you! - Stop it! Stop it! Shame on you! I love her! I want to marry her! What about his parents? They were killed by Spaniards in Prato. I'll be in place of his father and mother. Look, we have new oxen. I don't give a shit about the new oxen. What are you doing? Mind your own business. We're busy. - Go fuck yourself, the two of you. - Fuck you! And don't worry about the dowry. I'll give her the money to have a house and a family. How much do you want to give her? 1000 florins. Like this. 1000 florins... 1000 florins... Who has ever seen such an amount of money? Dad, Maria is pregnant. She needs to get married as soon as possible. Dad, Maria is pregnant. We need to make her marry someone. - Children? - Yeah, children... Fine, Master, but we need to make a contract. I brought a notary. He's waiting outside. That's why Parlanciotto is outside. I told you, we have to do it as soon as possible. Before her belly grows. Are you fine with doing it... on Saint Marco's day? Deal. Master! Did he accept? When are we going to get married? Scoundrel! You want to abandon me! Traitor! I know... I know! Go! The monster is coming! What's happening? - I'm dying! I've been poisoned! - What are you talking about? I've been poisoned! Who did it?! Were they the enemies, the Della Rovere? Raffaello? The Medici family? Sangallo? Sansovino! Come on! I know who did it! - I was sick too. What are you doing? - Let's go! Sansovino! Scoundrel! You made them poison me! Are you crazy? You hate me! For sure I hate you. You made them poison me. No. I'm not a coward like you. If I had only wanted, I could have strangled you with my own hands. - You're envious of me. - Yes, I am. Because you manage to betray a friend... so easily. You're only a scoundrel! Come on with that music. Come on! Go away! Go! You abhor people. You never said a good word about anyone! Because you don't deserve it. Let's go. Let's get out of here. You stole my contract! Remember! You'll never finish that facade! Did you hear me? Michelangelo?! You'll never finish anything! Come on, keep playing! Music! Oh, Florence... Don't leave me alone, Peppe... Don't leave me alone... I won't leave you... I won't leave you. FLORENCE Giovan Simone! Giovan Simone! Come here! Come! Are you in trouble again? What did you do this time? A doctor, a doctor, we need a doctor! - What happened? - Mamma mia! - What happened? - A disaster! What disaster? What do you mean? - We need a priest! - A priest? - Michelangelo! - Is he dead? Is Michelangelo dead? - I have to run! - Holy Mary! Go, run! A disaster happened! Holy Mary! Come on! Hurry up! So? What happened here? What's up with Michelangelo? He's been locked inside his room for three days. We've been bringing him food for three days, but he would not open. Penance! Penance--! He was the last one who talked with him. You! Come with me! - What's happening to Michelangelo? - He got sick in Carrara. Then we came here, and he lit a candle and started reading, and he told me to go away! - What if he's dead? - Shut up now! All of you! Michelangelo! My son! Someone's coming! Someone important. - Where is he? - He's there, Your Grace. I'm afraid that my son went completely crazy! He's been locked in that room for 3 days, and won't let anyone in. - 3 days? - Yes, 3 days, Your Grace. - What a smell! It smells like a pigsty! - Son! Go away! Take them away! That's what you've been working on... San Lorenzo's facade. You're working for the Medici! Imposter! Traitor! Do you remember your promise, you filthy animal? I looked for you in Rome and found the workshop closed! I thought you were working on the tomb! You deceived me! You deceived the Della Rovere again! This signature is yours! And this one too! And you signed this, too! You promised you would do everything! You signed the commitments you didn't keep! Now the Medici have declared war on us... Pope Leo wants us to sign a new contract for Pope Giulio's tomb. And you'll do it! But remember: whatever is written there, I swear you'll finish this tomb, even if you have to work on it until the end of your days! You'll work until it is ready! And he always needs money. Maybe you really lost your mind, but it doesn't matter. You'll sign the contract and work. Sign! And now a little joy you always need! Money... gold! Isn't this enough? Here you are. 1500 ducats! Take it! Take it! If you don't finish the tomb, someone else will, but I will kill you. Remember that. I'll kill you! Oh, God! I know I am fated to go to Hell. But why does he have to go to Hell too? Why this misfortune? "The one who deprived me of intellect and reason won't leave me to the mountain." FLORENCE Medici Palace His Eminence is arriving. Eminence! - How is it going? Is everything fine? - Yes. You wanted to see me... please forgive me. I was not feeling well the other day, and I couldn't come. I don't have a lot of time, so let's get straight to the point. We were informed that you got in touch with the suppliers from Carrara... to raise the price of the marble. You take 4 carlines for each wagon of marble. We are talking about thousands of florins. This has become intolerable. Eminence... you are saying these things straight to my face? Enough! Every day there are more and more rumours about me, each of them more infamous! I don't want to be subject to such injustice anymore. I don't want to be called a scoundrel by those who stole my honour and youth. Enough, Michelangelo! You need to understand that the curia has no more money. The Holy See is at war against France. Heresy is spreading across Germany, and the Germans are distorting the holy faith. Francesco Maria is gathering mercenaries to march against us. A conspiracy has just been revealed: Cardinals want to poison His Holiness. War and politics require a lot of money! And you, too... You too, who are part of the family... are trying to deceive us? Aren't you ashamed? Eminence... even if we assume that I took the money, and maybe even a bit more... with everything I have done already and that I'd like to do for the Medici family, this money is like invisible crumbs-- Enough! We want you to leave Carrara and go mine the marble from our mines in Pietrasanta! We don't want to pay crazy amounts to the Malaspina marquis! I can't leave like this! I need to pay a lot for the marble! Keep in mind that we won't pay a coin for the marble from Carrara. Go to Pietrasanta where the marble is as good as in Carrara... and it's also our own property. But there's no road there and no skilled stone cutters. Well, you'll have the road built and you'll also train the masons. It will take forever! It's one o'clock already! Michelangelo, I have no more time! Try to understand me. We want our own marble. It won't cost anything, and then... this marble will be yours, too. - Mine? - Yes, yours. We decided that if you manage to organize the extraction from Pietrasanta, you'll have all the marble you'll need for free. Always. It's because you're a Medici. We are ready to sign a contract. Come here! You won't believe this! We have our marble! - Really? - Yes! We have to go to Pietrasanta. Nobody in Carrara can know, otherwise they'll kill us. Yes, I understand. PIETRASANTA Guys, we have to stop here. The horses can't go anymore. The Monte Altissimo, can you see it? The highest mountain among the Apuan. You can see it from Sicily. - What the fuck are you saying? - Maybe not from Sicily, but you can see it from Sardinia. And when the sun sets, it shines like a diamond. Where are you? Where? I told you I want to go on my own. I couldn't leave you alone. It's dangerous here... and you don't know the way. The Altissimo... This mountain is yours. Look! All this marble is yours! What can I say to the people in Carrara? And Michele? What will he say? I owe him money. No... the Medici owe him! It's the Pope who doesn't want to pay. You need the marble. Here you have all the marble you want. It's more than enough. Think about how much you'll save if you don't have to pay for the extraction. And Raffaello will die soon... How can you know that? I think the same. I met him in Rome. He's deceiving himself. He's running around everywhere, acting like a clown... but I saw the horror in his eyes. But I feel sorry anyway. He's a genius. Money... Where there's money, there's always infamy. CARRARA Who was that? Did you recognize him? What is happening? Why is the monster... Where is everyone? What's happening? Where are the oxen? Why there are no ships? Why isn't my marble being carried? Someone came and told us to stop. He stopped the wagons... he sent the ships away with some stamped papers, and then he went away. Who was that? Someone sent by Alberico Malaspina. Alberico Malaspina... 5 years... 5 years in Carrara... would have been enough to create 5, 10 works... Monster... you ruined me! Your marble is under requisition... because of your decision. Decision? Michelangelo, you don't have to act surprised. You gave in under the pressure... and now you're about to leave Carrara. From now on you'll use the marble from the Medici's mines. The Medici... What an insatiable greed for wealth. Now they want to put their greedy hands on our money and on our Apuan marble. Not only will I lose money, but also all the people from Carrara. - And it's all your fault. - Why do you think so? He's a man of the Della Rovere family! What can he know about all of this? He's a man of great merit. He's really useful. He knows many things. I don't think that Mr. Al Farab would lie. Syrian assassins... They're everywhere! Master, you're not interested in the tomb of Pope Giulio anymore. Three days ago you went to Pietrasanta, to check the works and study some marble samples. It was just to have a look... On the same day, with a notary there, you concluded a contract... that put a certain Donato Benti in charge of the marble extraction in Pietrasanta. Here is the copy of the document. Do you want to take a look? No... That's how things are. Master... And with all this, I should allow you to load your marble and have it sent? - I'll pay! - Pay, then, and I'll give permission. But, Al Farab will check that the marble goes to Rome... for the tomb of Pope Giulio, as instructed by the Della Rovere family. I'm forced to do this by the powerful of this world. I understand it was not your choice, so I won't say anything to the masons. Do you know what we say where I'm from? Fa l'modr. It means you have to be careful... of what you do. Here in the mountains people are used to working on the edge of a precipice. One wrong step and you're dead. People from Carrara don't forgive. They're intrepid... they're not scared of you, of me, of the Pope, of anyone. And if only they found out! So if you have decided to leave... leave now. But you have to go to Rome. You have something else to say to Michelangelo, don't you? Yes. His Grace, the Duke Francesco Maria, is a particularly irascible and fiery man. I'm afraid he may carry out his threats, even though he might regret that in the future. I am under the protection of the Pope. Master, the Pope is far, whereas the traitors are always close. Think about your enemies. Yes... I have a lot of enemies... and you are one of them. Fa l'modr! Where did he put it? You fool, damned fool! You are a fool! Wretch! Here it is. What is this? How come you have these Venetian pure gold coins? Master... If you take another step. I'll stab you! Pietro! Stop him! In his pockets! What is it? It's poison! It's poison! - You wanted to poison me! It was you! - No, no! Who gave it to you? Help me! Help me! Underdog! I've never thought... I was given the poison, yes... but I would have never done it. You betrayed me. I would have never betrayed you... if you had loved me. You don't love me anymore. You don't love me anymore. It's true... I don't love you anymore. Go away... go away... go away. What did he tell you? Master... what did he tell you? Congratulations to the newly married! Let me talk! Long live the newly married! Thanks to our Master! Thanks to him we managed to do all this. That monster wouldn't have come down. You're crazy, you're crazy. If you didn't come to Carrara... This is the strength of the miners! Thanks to you. Excuse me! I am happy to be part of this group, because thanks to you, but above all to Michelangelo, I've become famous too. Even though we lost a man... But now I don't want it to become a sad thing. This is a party. Therefore, long live the newly married! And lots of male children! Thank you, Michelangelo. Cheers! To the newly married! Everyone's praising the master, right? Michelangelo? Sit down next to my wife. Sit down next to my wife. No worries. He will betray you too sooner or later, as he did with me. Right, Michelangelo? Tell them. - Sansovino, you're drunk. - More than drunk! - You're a fucking traitor, Michelangelo. - Leave him alone. But I forgive you, you know why? You're the greatest of all. You should be the happiest man on Earth, you know that? To you, Master. To your honour! - Let it go, sit with us. - Come sit here. Take a glass. To you, Sansovino! My heart is beating for this young couple, Maria and Pietro! You came... I looked for you, and you came. You came on the day of death. Two innocent children were killed... I know it's my fault. I thought I was going towards God, as you did... But I was actually going further and further away. I wanted to find God... but I only found Man. I know my creations are beautiful... People admire them... but nobody prays in front of them. Instead, they have sinful thoughts. I understood that you can't pray in front of them. They don't open the path towards God. I lost myself. Show me the way out. Silence? Listen. Listen?!
