{Our Word has already proceeded for our servants, the messengers} {[That] indeed, they would be those given victory} {and [that] indeed, Our soldiers will be those who overcome.} The city of Fallujah through the lens of Al-Furqan Media Allah is the Greatest! My Lord, (grant us) the victory that You promised. Indeed, openly speaking the truth and revealing the path of Ibraheem leads to real conflict with the camps of truth and falsehood. As such, the jihad waged in order to establish the religion as an Islamic obligation, which cannot be done correctly except with adherence to the truth and the Jama'ah with lots of effort and sacrifice so that the laws of the religion are defended and its penalties are carried out without fear of any criticism for the sake of Allah. And after patience, combat, strife and tribulation, we now see the Islamic State controlling a vast area in Iraq and Shaam with Al-Aqsa Masjid only (a short distance) away. Its building towers firmly, and conspiracies collapse within it, and break down against its walls. So before you, oh lover of good and seeker of jihad, is this blessed structure. So pick up the pace and get ready so that you might perhaps become one of its suitable bricks. And congratulations to whoever fulfils his contract with Allah. In the Name of Allah, and may peace and blessings be upon the messenger of Allah. Praise be to Allah who provided us (the blessing of) emigrating for His sake, and has blessed us by causing us to be a part of The Islamic State of Iraq and Shaam. We praise Allah for His blessings and for gathering us together with the lions of The Islamic State from every corner of the World We praise Allah who granted us the blessing of pledging allegiance to the Ameer (Commander) of the Believers, Abu Bakr Al-Quraishi Al-Baghdadi, may Allah preserve him. Oh Ameer, we've pledged to listen and obey, and we've pledged to die [for the sake of Allah], so lead wherever Allah has commanded you. We say to the twagheet (tyrants) and the disbelievers everywhere, we say to you as Ibrahim - peace and blessings be upon him - said to his (people), {Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allah. We have rejected you} {and there has started between us and you, hostility and hatred forever.} {until you believe in Allah Alone} And we say to you as the Prophet Muhammad - peace and blessings be upon him - said, "We have come to you with slaughter." So rejoice, oh disbelievers. Declare Allah the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! I swear by Allah the Almighty, we will cleanse the Arabian Peninsula of you, oh filthy ones. We will conquer Jerusalem, oh Jews. We, the children of Isaac, will conquer Rome. We will conquer Rome and take back Andalus with the permission of Allah the Exalted. Declare Allah the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! These are your passports, oh twagheet (tyrants) in every place. For I swear by Allah that we are Muslims. We are Muslims. We are Muslims. Declare Allah the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! CLANGING OF THE SWORDS 4 Clanging of the swords is the song of the defiant and the path of fighting is the path of life between an assault that exterminates the tyrant and the sound of silencer is a beautiful echo Raafida Hunters - Eliminating members of the Safawi (Shi'ah) army on their way to join their military units. By it my religion is honoured and the tyrants are humiliated So rise, oh my people to the path of the courageous For its either a life which delights the guided or a death that enrages the enemies Clanging of the swords is the song of the defiant and the path of fighting is the path of life between an assault that exterminates the tyrant and the sound of silencer is a beautiful echo Raafida Hunters - Eliminating members of the Safawi (Shi'ah) army on their way to join their military units. Eliminating a member of the Safawi SWAT forces Raafida Hunters - Eliminating members of the Safawi (Shi'ah) army on their way to join their military units. The hungry lions chase their prey He's is still alive. Finish him off. I'm a driver. Allah is the Greatest! One of the masajid in the state of Anbar We call every remaining member of the Sahawaat (Awakening Councils) without any exceptions, and every politician considered to be from Ahlus-Sunnah (Snni Muslims), We call them to repent and to announce that they will cease waging war against the mujahideen. And we call them to disassociate themselves from helping and supporting the malicious Raafidah. And anyone of them who does that before we get a hold of him, will be granted clemency from us. And we will not request anything of him regardless of what he has done in the past. Likewise, we call every policeman and soldier, and every member of the Safawi (Shi'ah) authorities, whether a member of the secret institutions or the public ones, to repent and turn in their weapons and equipment to the Islamic State. I swear by Allah the All-Mighty, I don't own any type of weapons. The apostates from the army, the police and the Sahawaat come out in crowds to declare their repentance and their disassociation from Kufr (disbelief) You carried those weapons and stood with those Raafidah, fighting your sons. We are your sons. We are your brothers. We came to protect your religion and your honour. Today is the day of pardon. And you know that our shaikh and ameer, Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, may Allah preserve him, said, even if they kill a million of us, even if they kill a million of us then pardon them and forgive them. And now we've pardoned and forgiven you. Do you know why? Because we want to rally Ahlus-Sunnah together. I disassociate myself before Allah, from this act of disbelief that I was involved in, and I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. The joy of the repentant on account of their return to Islam and on account of the forgiveness of their brothers, the mujahideen I disassociate myself before Allah, from this act of disbelief that I was involved in and I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. You are now our brothers and I ask Allah to protect you from all evil. If Allah wills. May Allah preserve your life. Leaving after collectively declaring their repentance Assaulting a Safawi (Shi'ah) army centre and killing all of its soldiers Oh brigades of my state. Let's go! Bring back our glory. Let's go! And place the crown of our ummah back on our heads. Let's go! Exterminate every tyrant and kindle your roasting fire. And take the life of every soldier you catch anywhere.

Oh brigades of my state. Let's go! Bring back our glory. Let's go! And place the crown of our ummah back on our heads. Let's go! The men of the Islamic State were, and continue to be loyal to us. Let's go as knights for the sake of Allah to Baghdad, the first. Let's go! Attacking the second building after taking control of most of the centre. The men of the Islamic State were, and continue to be loyal to us. Let's go as knights for the sake of Allah to Baghdad, the first. Let's go! Let's go bravely for the sake of Allah to the walls of our Damascus. Let's go! These are the pages of the heroes bringing an end to our humiliation. Let's go bravely for the sake of Allah to the walls of our Damascus. Let's go! These are the pages of the heroes bringing an end to our humiliation. Allah is the Greatest! That is the Grace of Allah. Those who remained alive in the 2nd building surrender. Allah is the Greatest! How many of you are alive inside? One of the apostates in the custody of the soldiers of The Islamic State of Iraq and Shaam. Here are the ones who attack the mother of the believers Aisha (radi Allah anha). Exterminate every tyrant and kindle your roasting fire. And take the life of every soldier you meet anywhere. These ones have been killed, by the permission of Allah, and praise be to Allah. Shaikh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Lateef Aal As-Shaikh said, describing the Raafidah (Shi'ah) of His time, "And as for now, their situation is even more hideous and atrocious as they added to their beliefs extremism with respect to the awliyaa (saints) and the righteous from the Prophet's family and other than them and believed that they could cause benefit and harm during difficulties and ease. And consider this a means of coming closer to Allah, and an aspect of religion that should be adhered to. Therefore whoever is hesitant concerning their disbelief, while this is their condition, and has doubts about it, then he is ignorant of the reality of what the messengers came with, and what the scriptures were revealed with. So let him re-examine his beliefs before entering his grave." Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! That is the Grace of Allah that he bestows on whomever He wills. Here are the vehicles being burned. Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! Stop for an hour, oh an era, and remember the era of the mighty. [Clensing Anbar of the Safawi army's barracks] Oh our people, Ahlus-Sunnah. Indeed the Islamic State exists only to defend you. And protect your rights, and stand in the face of your enemies. Indeed the Islamic Sate is your one true hope, after Allah the Mighty and Exalted, for coming out of the dark tunnel that your leaders and representatives placed you in through their alliance with the Raafidah. [Cleansing Anbar of the Safawi army's checkpoints and barracks] [Destroying a Counter "Terrorism" administration building in Fallujah and levelling it to the ground] Destroying what's referred to as Counter "Terrorism" and ridding the Muslims of its evil. Declare the oneness of Allah, and declare Allah is the Greatest, oh you have been oppressed by this dark, immoral, disbelieving department which for so long, has waged war against the monotheists and mujahideen. Our Muslim, mujahideen brothers remained within it for many long years in tyranny, oppression and injustice. {And they resented them not except because they believed in Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Praiseworthy} So this, with Allah's permission, is a scene which heals the breasts of the monotheists, and enrages the disbelievers and hypocrites. The Islamic State's explosives ...are more effective Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest, and Praise be to Allah! Clanging of the swords is the song of the defiant and the path of fighting is the path of life between an assault that exterminates the tyrant and the sound of silencer is a beautiful echo By it my religion is honoured and the tyrants are humiliated So rise, oh my people to the path of the courageous For its either a life which delights the guided Allah is the Greatest! Oh Allah, praise be to You. Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! Members of the Safawi army opening the road for the elite segment of Maliki's forces. The explosive is right under this apostate and he doesn't realize it. This apostate is scouting the road in fear of an explosive being present. The brother doesn't detonate the explosive waiting for a more valuable target. I ask Allah to blind his vision. Oh Allah. Oh Allah. Oh Allah. Oh Allah. Oh Allah. Oh Allah. Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! Detonate it! Detonate it! What's the problem? It didn't explode! Try again! Try again! Oh Allah. Oh Allah. Cone on, detonate it! Allah is the Greatest, and to Allah belongs all might! Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! You raised it so high! Allah is the Greatest! Indeed the caravan has set out towards a lofty goal, and a hope that the radiant hearts look up to. For this firm entity is nothing other than the fruit of unity, after success from Allah the Exalted. And here are the caravans of migrants to The Islamic State from every region of the earth unloading their luggage so they may let this blessed plant drink from their blood. In the Name of Allah, and may peace and blessings be upon the cheerful and yet lethal Prophet, Muhammad son of Abdullah, peace and blessings be upon him. The tyrants of the Khalifa family, the rulers of Bahrain, servants of the Salul (Saudi) family, and obedient American lapdogs, have issued an ultimatum granting the monothiest, Bahraini mujahideen who've set out for the battlefields of jihad, a period of two weeks to either return to Bahrain or have their citizenship revoked. So I say to them from this blessed place, Oh you miserable ones! Aren't you aware that we soldiers of The Islamic State of Iraq and Shaam have kicked away your citizenship? Aren't you aware that we've disassociated ourselves from it? Aren't you aware that you, your citizenship, your laws, your constitutions and your threats are all under our feet? Aren't you aware that our ameer, the Commander of the Believers, Shaikh Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi Al-Husaini Al-Quraishi, the one who destroys walls, demolishes borders and subdues the disbelievers, aren't you aware that he taught and ordered us not to recognize the filthy Sykes-Picot borders because the lands of the Muslims are one? Aren't you aware that he taught us that if we ever wanted to travel to any country, that we were not to travel with your despicable citizenship but rather we would expand with the permission of Allah and with His victory, and then eventually enter it? Aren't you aware that we are soldiers of The Islamic State of Iraq and Shaam, and that our state will expand and expand and expand until it uproots your thrones for which you sold your religion? Oh you tyrants, don't think that because we tear your citizenship to pieces and burn it that we won't return to our lands. No, I swear by Allah we will return with Allah's permission, but not with this. Rather, with this. I swear by Allah we are going to tear you to pieces one limb at a time. I swear by Allah we won't rest until we've hammered the last nail into your coffin. Oh you tyrants! This is your citizenship. I am a Muslim and I do not recognize it. May Allah brighten those faces that are until now like clouds, supplying drink from the veins of the heart when the hills become weak. A check point and patrol unit for hunting the apostates Checking information in the mujahideen's Wanted database Put your hand on your head! Take him and restrain him. Whose ID is this? It's mine. Hunting a member of the 4th Division of the Safawi army What is this ID? This is local government ID? Are you certain that you are a member of this department? Yes Are you in the university? Yes. You can go. Catching one of the criminals of the local government of Salahud-Deen (province). Members of the criminal apostate governor of Salahud-Deen's escort fleeing from the check point. One of the cars of the governor's security escort in the custody of the mujahideen Allah is the Greatest! This is the enemy of Allah. Imam Bukhari - may Allah have mercy upon him - said about the Rafidah "I don't differentiate between praying behind a Jew, a Christian or a Raafidhi. The meat from the animals they (Rafidah) slaughter is not to be eaten, their funerals are not to be attended, and thier sick are not to be visited." Praise be to Allah who has given us power, and continue to give us power everyday, over these apostates. To Allah belong praise and grace. Allah is the Greatest! Oh soldiers of The Islamic State! Know that you've entered a new stage in the battle, for you have returned to the cities and taken hold of the land. And let one of you be killed 1000 times before he even thinks of moving backward. Indeed the cities and areas under your control, at the head of which is Fallujah, will not be ruled, with Allah's permission, after this day except with the Shari'ah of Allah, and there is no place there for the secularists. Indeed Fallujah is the Fallujah of the mujahideen. Anbar is the Anbar of the mujahideen. Ninawa, Kirkuk and Salahud-Deen belong to the muwahideen. Diyala and Baghdad, from north to south belong to Ahlus-Sunnah. Declare Allah the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! The Islamic State ... Will remain! Declare Allah the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! Killing with silencers and snipers Kill him. Allah is the Greatest! He's been killed. Allah is the Greatest! He's dead, Allah is the Greatest! The sons of the Islamic State in the midst of their tribes in the state of Anbar We were pleased with all those that croak and bray who never belonged to the religion, who don't belong to this ummah (Muslim nation) at all? Investigate them and you'll immediately discover them to be apostates affiliated with the political circles of Tel Aviv. The (U.S.) occupation, my beloved ones, left behind secular parties in order to stand between the ummah and its return to the religion. The new occupation is even more malicious and harmful. It introduced what are referred to as "Islamic parties" in order to dissolve Islam and the face of Islam, and to slaughter our youth in the name of fighting terrorism and extremism. This is a major catastrophe and we must become aware of it. Right now the situation has become clear, and by Allah I'm astonished and amazed at those who, regardless of whether they wear turbans or not, call to elections What elections, my beloved brothers? My speech may be long but it is an issue of responsibility. These good blessed faces have gathered together and it's an obligation on us to shoulder the responsibility. Oh my brothers, I swear by Allah that what is being referred to as elections is nothing other than a new (tribulation), dressed in a filthy garment in order to place Ahlus Sunnah back under Maliki's cloak and agenda. What have you acquired from those you elected aside from killings, slaughter, and the blood of our jealous youth being spilled? I ask you by Allah, who are the ones that handed our dignity over to the Crusaders and the Safawis? Those same people we elected. They created militias, calling them armies, police forces and sahawaat (awakening councils). A Sahwaat of treachery and apostasy! And they took our best youth and turned them in to Maliki. But they didn't stop there. Rather, they did the most harmful thing ever done in the history of the Muslims. They handed the dignity of the Muslims over to the enemies at the hands of those who had called to elections and political action. So will we return, oh beloved ones to this face of treachery? Will we go back in turning our beards, turbans, intellects, honour and dignity, and hand it all to Maliki on a golden plate? Come on, my brothers. Raise your ambitions. I ask Allah the All-Mighty, Lord of the Great Throne, to give you power over him. Sahwaat hunters raid the home of a malicious sahwa commander Restrain him. Take it easy. Let me call the army so I can verify. Who are you? I'm afraid that you might be "Daesh" (ISIS). Who are you? Who are you? I have to know who you are. Get in. Where do you work? In the 12th Division? Yes. Where is Maliki's army to save you? Why hasn't it come? Maliki's army is a failure. Who brought you to Maliki's army if it's such a failure? I got myself involved and my father got me involved. This is your father who got you involved? What does your father do? My father is a Sahwa commander. Who was the Sahwa against? It became a Sahwa against the mujahideen defending your dignity? Yes, against the mujahideen. They're digging their own graves with their own hands. Are you tired of digging? You didn't get tired when you set out to become a commander in the Sahwa and were working at the check points. Dig. Pray that Maliki never has any success I advice everyone in the Sahwaat to repent and stop what they are doing. Now I'm digging my own grave. And today! . . . . . Yesterday! They came to my house and took me from my family's midst and no one gets away from them. Slaughter Part of "Operation: Armor of Ahlus-Sunnah." In Ramadi. Oh soldiers of truth let's go. Repeat the tune of endurance. A light has illuminated Shaam, so rally all the soldiers The Islamic State has been established, so wipe out all the borders. Wherever we travel, the Jewish rabbi is humiliated. Allah is the Greatest! Break the crosses and destroy the lineage of the grandsons of monkeys. The state of Tawheed will remain in spite of the lies of the malevolent people. Shooting down a Safawi helicopter with a surface to air rocket Imam Sam'ani - may Allah have mercy upon him - said: "The ummah has a consensus on the takfeer (excommunication) of the Imamite Shi'ah because they believe the sahabah were misguided and they reject their consensus and attribute things unbefitting of them." We've obtained cars, equipment, and the heads of the apostates, by Allah's permission. And the meeting place is Quds, if Allah wills. Declare Allah the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! These brothers are advancing. Today is the day of retribution. Allah is the Greatest! Sahwaat hunters terrorize the heads of disbelief in their homes. Routine search. Open the door. Allah is the Greatest! Oh Allah, praise be to you, oh my Lord. A malicious sahwa commander in the custody of the sahwa hunters I'm a tribe leader. Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! I fought terrorism. We consider your visit an honour for us even if you don't offer us anything. But we're extremely happy to have the governor of Diyala visit us. I fought terrorism. He puts down the stone of the Raafidah and prays on it because he's become Shi'ah. Noori. Noori. Duping a sahwa commander who's a malicious source for Safawi army intelligence Allah is the Greatest! Oh Allah, praise be to You, oh Allah. Listen, do you know who we are? No. We're The Islamic State. Allah is the Greatest! Oh Allah praise be to You. Allah is the Greatest! Oh Allah, praise be to You. Allah is the Greatest! Oh Allah, praise be to You. Allah is the Greatest! Turn your head o the left. Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! Oh Allah, praise be to You. Oh Allah, praise be to You. In revenge for our brothers, you dog. You enemy of Allah. Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! May Allah reward you with good. Members of the army, police and sahwa come in crowds to the repentance centre in Anbar Oh Ahlus-Sunnah in Iraq. It's not possible for us to see your sons as slaves for the Raafidah, servants for them, and subordinates to them and remain quiet. It's not possible for us to see them taking up the path to Hell and then leave them. We don't want anything for you other than honour and dignity in this world, and salvation and happiness in the hereafter. And you won't see anything from us but mercy and compassion. Don't you see we accept the repentance of your sons even if they killed a million of us? Don't you see that we won't ask him anything except that he throws down his weapons, stops supporting the Raafidah and the tyrants, and return to his religion? May Allah preserve your life. I swear by Allah, your blessed decision to attend has delighted our hearts. Our Lord, Blessed and Exalted, says: {Except for those who repent and correct themselves and make evident [what they concealed]} {Those- I will accept their repentance and I am Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.} We don't want you to come to this place and repent out of fear from us, because if you fear us then there is no good in you. We want your repentance and return to be due to the fear of Allah the Exalted. You return, repent and come back to your Lord out of fear from Allah, the Mighty and Exalted. not out of fear from the swords of the mujahideen, because we are your sons and your brothers. I disassociate myself before Allah from this act of disbelief that I was involved in and I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. I ask Allah to protect you, and to accept this repentance from you. Ameen. If Allah wills, it will be a sincere, truthful repentance and it will be a repentance that Allah, Blessed and exalted accepts from you. Oh youth, a while back we accepted the repentance of a group of people. Then they joined a new sahwaat. I swear by Allah other than Whom there is no god, we have their names with us. They were apostates, and then they came here and declared their repentance here. Then they apostatized and joined the new sahwa. I swear by Allah other than Whom there is no god, there will no longer be any repentance for them. Any of them whom we get hold of, by the permission of Allah, the Most Merciful and Exalted, will be brought before his tribe leader and clan elders, and we will carry out his penalty in front of the people. All those who walk this path will meet the same end. Allah is the Greatest! The apostates have left their Hummers and fled. Oh Allah, praise be to You until You're satisfied, oh Allah. Allah is the Greatest! Exterminating a convoy of the Safawi army after attacking its base My brother, inform my companions that I'm leaving and going forward. I will leave the glitter of the worldly life and won't say where I'm going. To mount a horse towards the Most Merciful, in comfort when I'm buried. I'm blowing up the enemy's barracks, how treacherous and deceitful they are. Do you see what I see in the palm trees in their gardens? Do you hear the sound of their cannon beating the drums of the wedding ceremony in overwhelming manner? The smoke from my bombs is musk, and the scent from my missile is ambergris. My brother, if I die then join me, for a life of humiliation is no life at all. Allah is the Greatest! Ibn Katheer - may Allah have mercy upon him said, discussing the Raafidah's insults against the companions of Allah's messenger, peace be upon him: "And whoever thinks that about the companions, with whom Allah is pleased. has accused them of immorality, and of colluding to oppose the messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, and of opposing him in his rules and in his dictates. Whoever arrives at this position has taken off the noose of Islam, has disbelieved according to the consensus of the noble imams. and shedding his blood is more halaal than getting rid of wine." Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! Raiding the home of a tyrannical criminal in the Counter "Terrorism" forces What's your name, sir? Makki Mahmood Ameen. You're a soldier, sir? No, I'm an officer holding the rank of "Major" Where do you work? Anti crime unit in the city of Samaraa, Salahuddeen. What type of weapon do you have? I have a Kalashnikov. What exactly do you do? I work in the Counter-Terrorism administration in Salahuddeen. and I'm connected to the Counter-Terrorism office in Samaraa. The mujahideen of The Islamic State do not forget and do not sleep in the face of injustice. I swear by Allah, our minds won't be at ease, and we won't rest, and life will not be pleasant for us, as long as there remains a single Muslim in the prison of the disbelievers. We pledge to Allah and then pledge to you that we will stop at nothing to get you out, and that we will expend our lives and our wealth to that end, and we will spare no effort in plucking the heads of those judges and investigators that are butchering you. Clanging of the swords is the song of the defiant and the path of fighting is the path of life between an assault that exterminates the Tyrant and the sound of silencer is a beautiful echo By it my religion is honoured and the tyrants are humiliated So rise, oh my people to the path of the courageous For its either a life which delights the guided or a death that enrages the enemies Clanging of the swords is the song of the defiant and the path of fighting is the path of life between an assault that exterminates the tyrant and the sound of silencer is a beautiful echo Allah is the Greatest!

Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! Oh Allah, guide our aim. Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! Oh my ummah, a new dawn has emerged, so witness the clear victory. The Islamic State has been established by the blood of the truthful. No one will ever stand between the mujahideen and their people in Iraq after this day with Allah's permission. The Islamic State has been established by the jihad of the pious. They offered their lives in truth with firmness and conviction. The Islamic State has been established by the jihad of the pious. They offered their lives in truth with firmness and conviction. To establish the religion containing the laws of our Lord. Oh my ummah rejoice and do not despair, Victory is near. The Islamic State has been established and sublime honour has become apparent. Oh my ummah rejoice and do not despair, Victory is near. The Islamic State has been established and sublime honour has become apparent. It arose depicted in glory, and the era of strangeness came to an end At the hands of faithful men, who do not fear war. Declare Allah the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! I swear by Allah oh youth, we will defend your blood with our own blood, and your necks with our own necks, and the Crusader and the Persian Safawi armies will not pass unless it's over our dead bodies. With the permission of Allah the Exalted. In the Name of Allah, and Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! The Islamic State has attacked and encircled the tyrants. Armoured vehicle hunters in The Islamic State The Islamic State has attacked and encircled the tyrants. Allah is the Greatest! The apostates come out. Allah is the Greatest! Assaulting a Safawi army barracks and exterminating everyone inside Imam ibn Hazm - may Allah have mercy upon him - said: "Indeed the Raafidah are not from the Muslims. It is a sect that follows the way of the Jews and the Christians in lying and disbelief." Attack them in a manner that destroys the army of the disbelievers. And let the clash of your swords heal the breasts of the believers. Our long possessed glory won't return without the lions of the den. The lions of the caliphate gone forward to crush disbelief. Praise be to Allah, whose army cannot be defeated, and whose allies cannot be humiliated. And peace and blessings be upon the cheerful, yet lethal Prophet, and upon his companions, the lions of combat. As for what follows: Praise be to Allah, Who bestowed His grace upon us such that we assaulted their barracks, killed their soldiers, and captured some of them as prisoners. These are the Raafidah, and their officer in now in the custody of The Islamic State of Iraq and Shaam Now listen to what this Raafidhi says. What's your name? Haidar Mohammed Abd-Ali What do you work as? As an officer. Do you know what is the fate of those who transgress against the Muslims, and against Ahlus-Sunnah? Do you know what your fate will be or not? By Allah, I know what it is. What's the fate of those who fight us? By Allah, the same as my fate. What's your fate? My fate is slaughter. The Raafihad before and after the mujahideen get a hold of them. Allah is the Greatest! The Islamic State... Will remain. The Islamic State... Will remain. Well done. And so the flame was started in Iraq and its heat will increase, by the Will of Allah, until it burns the Crusaders in Dabiq. (The place of Al-Malhama Al-Kubra).
