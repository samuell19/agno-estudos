Princess Iron Fan Journey to the West is a wonderful children's story, but the world often misunderstands it as a fantasy novel. This film was made for the purpose of training the hearts and minds of children. The story is pure, untainted by fantasy. Fiery Mountain blocking the path of Tang Seng's company is a metaphor for the difficulties in life. In order to overcome them, one must keep faith. Everybody must work together in order to obtain the palm leaf fan and put out the flames. Tripikata True Sutra It's already autumn, how can it still be so warm? Fool, don't talk rubbish. We should hurry and get on our way. Wukong, where is this place? We must pass through here to continue westwards, that much is certain. Might we have taken the wrong path? Why is it so hot here? Master, look! Isn't that a house up ahead? Let's go in and rest for a while, OK? This place is called Fiery Mountain. The fire stretches for hundreds of miles. Not single straw of grass can grow here. The four seasons of the year are all warm. You couldn't pass through the mountain even with a head of copper and arms of iron. What kind of place is this? Master, don't worry! The three of us are all strong enough to pass! Master, I'll go and have a look! Wukong, what was it like? Bad, bad, very bad. If I were any slower the fur on my tail would have been burned off. Noble host, the fires here are so big. How can you grow any crops? A thousand miles from here lives Princess Iron Fan. She has a palm leaf fan. Wave the fan once and the fire goes out. Twice and the wind starts blowing. Three times and the rain starts coming down. In the following period we plant and harvest. However, asking that princess to come is certainly no simple matter. Where does she live? She lives in Palm Leaf Cave at Emerald Cloud Mountain. Does she live there alone? Doesn't she have a husband? Her husband is Bull Demon King. What, her husband is Old Bull? Fool, you know him? Come with me to borrow the fan! Actually... Old Bull doesn't live there. Looking for his woman when he isn't home isn't very... appropriate. You... you... the two of you go. I... I'll stay here and serve Master. Sha Wujing, go with your two fellow apprentices. Palm Leaf Cave Fool, I always go first. This time it's your turn! Junior! I always go first, this time it's your turn! Senior... I'm asking you to make a small effort for Master. Can't you do that? Hurry up! Simple monk, where did you come from? The Great Sage... Tang Seng... wants your princess... Nonsense! Senior... why don't you go instead? Fool, you go! Senior, why don't you go? Lazy fool! Great God of Thunder! Don't kill me, let me go! Go tell your princess that Sun Wukong has come to borrow the fan. Yes, yes! Let me loose, I'll go at once. Grandma, there's a Sun Wukong outside asking to borrow the fan. Quickly fetch my sword. Sun Wukong, you hurt my son! You dare come here to meet your death? I've never met you before, how could I have harmed your son? My son Red Child's life was ruined, wasn't that your doing? Your son is with the Goddess of Mercy now, how can you say that I hurt him? Enough rubbish! Come here and let me chop you with my sword. If you can take it I'll lend you the fan. Really? Stop! Quickly give me the fan! Great Sage, weren't you going west? Why have you come back here? Princess Iron Fan blew me here with a single wave of her fan. That's truly amazing, Great Sage. I have something for you. This is a wind pearl. When you use it, your heart will become steady as a rock. Princess Iron Fan won't be able to move you. Great Sage, come and have a look. Thank you. Senior... where... where has he... been blown to? Who cares about him? Let the monkey handle himself. Let's go. Senior... senior... You... you... Where were you blown to by that old lady? Fool, now it's definitely your turn to go. I'm not going, a single wave of her fan could blow me to some faraway land. Maybe it's better if you go again. I won't go. Next time I won't let you off! This time I won't move no matter how much you wave, as sure as I call myself am a man! Senior, how come this time her fan couldn't move you? Let's break our way in. Quickly bring out the fan for Sun Wukong! Sun Wukong, where are you? I'm in your stomach! Sun Wukong, spare me! Only if you give me the fan! I promise, I'll give it to you. Please come out! Hurry up and bring the fan. We've brought out the fan. Why haven't you come out? Open your mouth and I'll come out. Sun Wukong, why haven't you come out? Here I am. Lend me the fan for a while, I'll return it. Master has been waiting long enough, let's get going! Scripture, what is scripture? Scriptures are the principles that link heaven and earth. They are the principles of man. Only he who holds these principles can rid himself of pain and live a good life, live a true and honest life. Conversely, he who does not know these principles, will live a life full of misery. Even his son or grandson will not achieve happiness. Why am I going to get the scripture? Because men nowadays are trapped in misery. In order to achieve this goal, we are going to appear before the Tang emperor and discuss this very complicated matter. Did you get the palm leaf fan? We have it. Is this it? Noble hosts, now that we have the fan, we will take our leave. Hold on. Everyone, I would like to ask Sage Seng to stay here for a few more days. Do you agree? Agreed! Thank you for your kindness. But the sooner I leave the sooner we can complete our task. Very well, will the honorable apprentice first go to Fiery Mountain. After extinguishing the flames, continue to follow Sage Seng. All right, go ahead! Princess Iron Fan is really despicable, she gave us a fake fan! I'll kill her for sure! No, killing her is the wrong thing to do. I won't let you kill anyone. Let's think of something else. Senior, how could you be fooled by her? After making such an effort all we got was a fake fan. Ridiculous, ridiculous. Then you go! OK, I'll go, I'll go, I'm going! I'll go find Bull Demon King. This is a good solution. Partner, what do you think? We'll see how you do. What do you think, am I pretty today? Beautiful, my baby. Accompany me for a walk outside the cave, all right? My baby, why don't you go by yourself. Why of course, I'm just a plain country girl. Taking me outside might cause you to lose face. Baby, what are you saying? You go ahead, I'll come out in a while, all right? Emerald Cloud Cave Goddess, you're truly an angel come down from heaven. Who... who are you? I've come from Palm Leaf Cave to look for Bull Demon King. Let go of me! Goddess, slow down! Emerald Cloud Cave Baby, who has bullied you? You! How could I bully you? Why don't you go back to Palm Leaf Cave? It would spare you some embarrassment. They often send people to look for you, and bully me. Has there been someone here to look for me? There's a pig monk outside looking for you. He almost scared me to death. How can this be? Wait while I go out to have a look. Bull, old friend! There's a very beautiful young lady in here. Hey, that's my woman! Why have you come to bother her? Oh, I didn't know, please forgive me! You didn't know, so I can't blame you. Off you go! No, no. I still have something I need you to help me with. We were on our way to retrieve the scriptures when we arrived at Fiery Mountain. Please ask your wife to lend us the palm leaf fan for a while. Absolutely not! Tang Seng and Sun Wukong are my son's enemies. I'd love to take my revenge on them. Your son is with the Goddess of Mercy now, please don't fight. All right, since we are old friends, I won't fight you. Now go away! Baby, that pig monk is a friend of mine. He wasn't sent from Palm Leaf Cave at all. I don't believe you. I'm not lying to you! Where is that monk now? I've already scared him away. Palm Leaf Cave The king has returned! Where's grandma? She's inside. By what honor has the king come to visit today? I heard that Sun Wukong and Tang Seng are coming here. I'm afraid they want to use the palm leaf fan to pass Fiery Mountain. That monkey is the one who harmed our son. I'll get him sooner or later, we will have our revenge. Darling, why are you crying? That monkey has already been here. I refused to give him the fan. I don't know how, but he got inside my stomach. It hurt so bad I thought I would die. At last I had no choice but to give him the fan. That's terrible, how could you give him the fan? I gave him a false one. A false one? A banquet to celebrate the king's return Please drink the fine wine. The chicken is fragrant, the duck is beautiful, and the pig is fat. I try my best to sing, I try my best to dance. You must also try your best to drink. My king! You dumped the old one. You love another woman. Countless tears were spilled for you. When the light is out and the curtain is dropped, you will sleep alone. You too will taste loneliness. Pardon me for not making you company. Even if we are on the same bed, we will sleep under separate sheets. King, I'm drunk. Darling, where did you put the real fan? That monkey is very deceitful, and the pig has even greater skill. If you're not careful they might trick you. Our treasure is right here. King, what are you thinking about? Why don't you take it? My treasure. Emerald Cloud Cave Baby, have another cup. Drink. Gold Dragon King has asked me to drink with him tonight Then you should go. That's right. You should prepare the golden eyed beast for grandpa. I will. You should drink a little less tonight. Otherwise I won't be able to wake you up. It's terrible, grandpa's golden eyed beast has disappeared! Are you all deaf and blind? How could it just disappear? Baby, don't mind them. I'm afraid Zhu Bajie might have stolen it. Maybe I should go over to Palm Leaf Cave. What? You've had this planned all along. You still want to go over to that shameless woman? Please baby, don't cry. I'll be back soon. Palm Leaf Cave Come over here, drink a little! Now I can relax. We don't have to worry about our treasure being stolen. Even if they stole it, they wouldn't know to pull the silk thread. Having just a pearl won't be of any use. Pulling the thread will turn it into a fan, right? King, you're drunk. You forgot about your own treasure, and are asking me. Lady, look at who I am. Who are you? I am Tang Seng's second apprentice, Zhu Bajie. Sorry about bothering you, and thanks! Bye! Bull's wife is too flirtatious. All her underlings are handsome. Old Pig almost couldn't take it. Using clever tricks and tactics, I stole their treasure away. This is a great accomplishment. Sandy should be on his knees. Monkey should learn from me. Even Master will be astonished. Old Pig is truly masterful. Old Pig is truly masterful. Fool, how are things going? Not only did I get the fan, Princess Iron Fan was my wife for half a day, too. You got a good deal. Hey, let me see the fan. Why did you shrink it? Old Pig, you do recognize me, right? Stop joking around with me. Who's joking around with you? Fool, how did it go? It was all for nothing. Wuneng, did you borrow the fan? I found Bull Demon King, but he refused. Then, I turned into his look-alike. I tricked Princess Iron Fan into giving me the fan. But then Old Bull turned into your look-alike and tricked me into giving it back. Old Bull's skills are great. I got beaten up by him, too. How could you get the fan and still be such a fool? Not everything revolves around you! Don't fight, we should quickly think of a solution. In which... which direction is there no fire? Of east, south, west, north, there's fire only to the west. So we have no option but to go back. This path is blocked, what other options do we have? Bajie, don't talk like that. There will always be obstacles in our path. To complete our sacred task we must be strong in our faith. We can't change our goal half way just because we encounter some obstacles. The reason that we've been defeated is that we haven't worked together. If the three of you work as one, put your strength together to fight Bull Demon King, then you will certainly be victorious. We have heard the order of Master and will fight Bull Demon King to the end. to... to the end. That's excellent! We have all been through hardships. I hope everyone will make an effort together with my disciples to defeat Bull Demon King and put out the flames of Fiery Mountain. Otherwise this misery will never end. We have heard the order of Master, to seek happiness for all. Everyone work together! All right! Grandma, it's terrible! Grandpa has been trapped, come quickly and look! The fight's not over yet, not over. Careful, careful. Beast, all you have to is give us the fan and we'll spare your life. Old Bull, where is the fan? Hand it over! My... my wife... has it. Darling, darling! Save me, hurry! Give them the fan. King! All right, all right! Wukong, you go one more time! The End
