[music playing] [music playing] You're entering a time of great chaos. That's why I've agreed to listen to your offer. The commies are coming Mr Lee. And they like to have things their way. And you've got one of the most successful underground fighting rings here in Asia. But you see when Beijing comes over, things can be a lot different. Am I right? What do you have to offer Mr. Alderton. Well. You're an old man Mr Lee. But you and your little Sheila here, you can find you some island, retire. I take the whole operation, move it across the pond. [laughter] A man who has lived his entire life in Hong Kong requires more excitement than Sydney can offer. There isn't enough money in your poor, pathetic commonwealth to convince me to retire there. Poor? Pathetic? Good day Mr. Alderton. I'm afraid it's not that easy mate. You see my boss, he tell me to come over and take your operation, no matter what the cost. So I guess negotiations had just broken down, huh? [gun shots] [screams] I think it's time to contact our American friends. [music playing] [cheering] It's no good Paulie. Don't start this kid. I fought hard to get here. We fought hard. We have. And now we take the fall. Like the man said, it ain't your night. It's not right. Right. I've been doing this so long, I don't know what right is anymore. You really telling me that? Nah. I know what right is. Right is you fighting pro. It's scum like Mr Lee behind bars. You know what right is? Maybe it's the commies not taken over in Hong Kong. And maybe it's petrol at $0.60 a gallon. Yeah. That's what right is. When was the last time you bought a gallon of gas? That's what I mean. It ain't right. But that's the way it is. Listen to me Shane. You don't cross these people. You cross them, you're dead. All right. I'll be a good boy. Relax my boy. Tonight is your night. Mr Lee. [inaudible], I thought it was hot in Vegas until I came over here, Mr. Lee. Don Nicholas, you hone my humble fight arena. Pleasure's all mine. And please, call me Uncle Nicky. Nobody calls me Don anymore, except maybe the Feds, huh. [laughter] MR LEE: I appreciate you coming all the way. Don't mention it. You know, if this works out, there's going to be plenty of money on the table for both of us. Ah. May I present Abdul. He's going to win the contest tonight. When? What do you mean, these fights are fixed? They better be. huh. [laughter] I'm just pulling your chain. And the other fighter? He's, uh, how do you call? Resigned. Yeah. He's resigned to his fate. Well as you would say, the fix is in. Yeah. [cheers] OK, ladies and gentlemen. This is the moment you've all been waiting for-- main event time. Abdul, Abdul Sabbah, where are you mate? Come on down. He's mean. He's fierce. He's a super fresh killer all the way from the streets of Morocco, the Amazing Abdul! And in this corner. He's wild. He's crazy. Our very own Hong Kong lost boy, Shane McQuade! [cheers] Gentlemen, there's only one rule. That's fight like men. I know you can do that. [bell rings] Damn. That was fast. Was that fast? Because it felt fast. You make it too easy. These boys are good Mr Lee, best in the business. How do you find them? The slums of every city. It's just a matter of selection. Natural selection, huh. Like, uh, how do you call them? Evolution. Yeah, evolution. Survival of the fittest. How you doing kid? Never better. Keep it cool out there. Don't let them get to you Shane. You hear me? Yeah. I can hear you. Watch that temper. You only got two rounds to go. You can make it. [bell rings] Oh yeah. Oh yeah. You know what? It's almost nap time. Good night. Aw, you want Mommy to tuck you in? Is that what you want? Aw no you don't. I guess you ain't got a Mommy. All you got is that old, drunk freak in the corner. Isn't that right? The white kid's got a real flair for drama. He's quite a-- how do you call it? Performer. Performer, yeah. He's a regular Meryl Streep. You'd almost think there was no fix in. Son of a-- 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Why'd you kill him man? 7. 8. 9. 9 comes after 8. You don't know about the [inaudible] you made. 9. 10. And the winner, Shane McQuade! [crowd repeatedly chants shane] Come on kid, we're out of here. Relax Paulie, can't you hear them? They love Me! Yeah I can. Come on. I got to tell you Mr Lee, I'm a little disappointed. This kind of thing is totally, uh-- Unacceptable. Yeah, unacceptable, especially if we're going to consider picking up your franchises in the States. Please accept my humble apologies. If there is anything I can do to make it up? I'll think of something. Until then, I'll be at the hotel. Good night. [non english speech] Come on kid, move it. We got to get out of here. You probably have to leave town. Look, there's a name and address, Alia. She'll get you out of this. What's got into you? It was only one fight. Look, I'm sorry I blew it. But he called you a drunk Paulie. I am a drunk Shane. Not anymore. Not so much. And anyway, the crowd loved it. Mr Lee wouldn't do anything to harm his most popular fighter. Can he still be so naive even after years of your training? He's just a hot tempered kid Mr Lee. I'll, I'll get him into line. I promise. I'm sorry Mr Lee. I, I just got mad. You have to learn control. I thought maybe Paulie would teach it to you. Perhaps he still can. You're quite right about one thing. I can't injure my most popular fighter. If I cannot hurt you, how can I control you? No! Shut up Shane. [gun cocking] [gun shot] I'm sorry I brought you here kid. You got to get away. You gotta go. No Paulie, no. I'm going to stay here with you. No. No. You, you gotta get away. Go. That was an avoidable accident. See what your rashness has brought on? Good. These are the fruits of anger. Remember this. Don't worry. I will remember this. No. You'll hit me. Look's like we're going to have to end this another time Mr Lee. [whistle blowing] [knocking] [inaudible] [non english speech] Go away. Will you just get the bloody door already? Ow! Bitch, why don't you get the door. [knocking] Who is it? SHANE: Friend of Paulie's. Well come on back later friend of Paulie's. SHANE: It's an emergency. Paulie knows I never do business before dark. Let him hold your hand until them. I'm just going to go lay down. SHANE: Paulie's dead. He told me you could help me. I need to get out of Hong Kong. Come on in. [airplane engines] OK. I'm in. Where do you want to go? I don't know? Oh, that's not very helpful? How about Australia? Why Australia? You always want to send people to Australia. Nobody wants to go there. It's nice there. No it's not. It's hot and dusty. It's got snakes. You haven't even been. Of course I have. Oh yeah when? Well, it's been-- I have a friend in America, Las Vegas. Nothing direct to Vegas. Now how about Los Angeles? Is that close to Las Vegas? It's close enough. [music playing] Looking for a ride pal? Might be. Might be. That's good. Unless that car's coming back, I think you need a ride. Maybe I'll just stay here. There is no here. This isn't a real place. You can't stay somewhere that isn't even a place. Where you headed? VINNIE: Vegas. Las Vegas? That's the one. Well I hear that's not much of a real place either. You got me there pal. Coming? Ah, thanks. Don't mention it. Vinnie Vasta. It's nice to meet you. And you are? It's not a trick question. Paulie. Paul. So, where you header, Paulie Paul? Las Vegas. Got friends there? Family? Guy I used to know. No family. No family. No family anywhere? Where you from? Very far away. What, like Asia or something? My mother was Chinese. How'd you guess? I can always tell. Listen Paul, I left something in the trunk. I wonder if you could get it out for me. Yeah sure. What is it? You'll know when you see it. Surprise? What the hell? Pick him up. What are you, nuts? Pick him up. That's a good boy. Let's take a walk. This looks good. Put him down. Get to work McQuade. That's your name, isn't it? Shane McQuade. Don't you know you're famous? Famous? Guess you haven't seen the papers. You made front page a few days back Shane. You're a one man killing machine. First you break some guys neck, and then you shoot your own manager. I didn't- Dig Shane. That's what I brought you out here for. Shane McQuade. How'd you get a name like that? I got it from a guy who liked American Westerns. Huh. I never liked Westerns. All that cowboys and Indians crap. It's stupid. When I saw you, I couldn't believe my luck. See, I was feeling pretty stupid. Wore one of my best suits today and forgot to change when I had to cap this guy and bring him out here. Now I got you. Cheap labor. When I show you to the boss, he'll split a gut. As soon as we bury this guy, we'll head into Vegas. You'll love Vegas. So, it's gonna be like this? I guess so. [music playing] What does a guy have to do to get a drink around here? Can't you see I'm busy? Not too busy for me, Jason. Jesus. Not quite. I gotta talk to my old friend here. Come on. What the hell is wrong with you? OK, well, I haven't seen or heard from you in 10 years. Then one day I read in the papers that you killed a couple of people in Hong Kong. And within a week, you're dropping in for a chat. Coincidence? I think not. We were best friends once. Once. Times change. You knew me then. You know I couldn't kill Paulie. What, you're telling me it's a frame? Look, I just need a place to lie low until I can figure out what to do. Well, uh, Dad always told me not to believe what you read in the papers. Dad was right. You can stay with me for a week. Then you move on. Thanks. I really appreciate this. Don't thank me yet. There's a little complication you need to know about. I want you to have a drink in your hand when I tell you this. Hey, you remember Marian? Marian. Marian Starret? Yeah, I bets that's the one. Damn. I haven't thought about her in years. She broke up with me after my first fight, around the time you left for the States. Haven't seen her since. Yeah. I know. Hey, what's your problem. Sorry. Hey, why don't you watch where you're going. Sorry, no problem. Hey, don't turn your back on me when I'm talking to you. I thought we were through talking. Oh, we're through talking. Thank you. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks. And just what the hell do you think you're doing? Gentlemen, gentlemen. That was just a bit of extra entertainment. No need to be worried. Especially, because coming to the main stage here at the world famous Fantasy Island is our featured entertainer, Miss Angelique. It's OK boss. He's a friend of mine. Those other guys started it. OK. Never start trouble, just finish it. BOSS: Well, she's got it. [inaudible]. Hey, hey, hey, hey, listen, listen, listen. My name is Marx Bender. And everything that you see in here, I own. It's nice to meet you. You looking for work? Doing what? Finisher. Come on, come on. I'm not talking about nothing shady here. I'm talking about being a bouncer, doorman. You know, that sort of thing. You might even be working with Jason behind the bar. A little honest work never killed anybody. All right. You've got yourself a deal. Great. Now Jason's going to show the ropes. And by the way, what do you call yourself? Vincent. Vincent Vasta. Well OK Vinnie, it's nice to meet you. I can call you Vinnie, right? Yeah, sure. OK, welcome. Uh, who the hell is Vinnie Vasta? I am for now. Whatever you say Vinnie. [inaudible] Mr Lee. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. My friends tell me you have something to sell. Of course. Guns, the finest. Five case of Uzis, 10 cases of AR-15s. I'm prepared to pay market value. Where is the merchandise? Right outside, in truck. Excellent. I will return it to its proper owner. The United States Army? You hijacked a shipment belonging to my Uncle Nicky. You know my Uncle Nicky, don't you? So what. I stole from an American. What does it matter to you? I'm thinking of relocating. [gun shots] [gun shots] [gun shots] [applause] I didn't realize you took such a-- Proactive. Like he said, such a proactive part in the business anymore Mr Lee. [moaning] [gun shots] This takes me back. I hope this humble favor which I have done with my own hand will erase my dishonorable shame. That's right Mr Lee, we're all square. Speak. It's all right. We're a family. We have no secrets. Shane McQuade has been found. He's in Las Vegas. Las Vegas? Excellent. I think it's time for you to start filling out those change of address cards. [laughter] Shouldn't make bets you can't cover. Come on man. I just need a couple more days. That's what they all say. SHANE: Hey! Can't you see I'm busy up here? Come on. Kick his ass. Screw with me man. Thanks kid. Forget it old man. You know, you shouldn't mess with those boys. They play rough. Yeah, tell me about it. Hey, hey, hey, where, where did you learn to fight like that? Around. Hey kid, you got a lot of speed and energy, but you've got no technique. I could teach you some things. No thanks. I think I can handle myself just fine. Nah, kid, kid, you don't understand. You seem, I'm talking about money. You could make a living with those fists. Easy old man. Shane. Shane. [gun shots] Don't leave me Shane! Don't leave me Shane! [gun shots] Shane. Shane. Marian. VINNIE: Sorry to wake you, but you were thrashing around. I was getting a little worried. Oh. I had a nightmare. I've had a bad week. So I hear. No. It's not what you think. You don't have to explain. Besides, the less Jason and I know, the better. You're right. You were always right. You never listened. I was always stupid. You were always right. You were always late. Hey. How you feeling? Better now. Thanks. Don't mention it. Bye honey. Good morning honey. 10 years too late. [music playing] Would you look at this. It's fine sir. Why don't you call me Marx? You know, you're, um, you look like you're in pretty good shape. You an athlete? I keep in shape. You ever play any sports? A little football, a little baseball? How about boxing? You ever did any fighting? I mean, I'm just curious, because you do have a fighter's build. Yeah? You see, I um, I do a little fight manager on the side. Not interested. You know, I mean I'm just saying, it is a good way to pick up an extra buck here and there. I'm not interested. OK. OK. No harm in me asking. Enjoy the show. Ready to go? I've got a little more cleaning up to do. You go ahead. I'll lock up. Thanks though. -OK. All right. Don't make too much noise coming in. I won't. Good night. Oh, I didn't realize you were still here. Yeah. I took a nap after my last number. Well, I could let you out if you like. You're Vincent, right? You're Angelique. Name suits you. Thanks. Your doesn't suit you very well though. Well. You don't look like a Vincent. How'd you get that name? I got it from a guy who didn't like Westerns. He liked gangster movies. Did you see me dance tonight? Yeah, I caught a little of it. Little? Well, I try to keep my eyes on the customers. Wouldn't want to be too distracted if someone started trouble. Oh I see. So you're too busy to watch me dance. Is that it? I think I can fix that. Have a seat. Vincent. You're not sitting. [music playing] Ah! ANGELIQUE: So where'd you learn to fight like that? SHANE: Everybody asks me that. Do you [inaudible]? Not usually. Did you recognize those men that attacked us? Just a couple muggers. I should have? They weren't muggers. They were in the bar yesterday. And tonight, they were waiting by your car. Come on, you're scaring me. You're just being paranoid. Yeah. I've had a bad week. Oh babe. Turn around. Why? Just turn around. Oh god. Does that feel better? Oh yeah. What happened here? Like I said, bad week. [music playing] Watch the [inaudible]. Shane. Shane. Please Shane, I don't want you to fight. I hate it. But it's the only thing I'm good at. That's talent. You got a talent. When you have a talent, it's a crime against God not to use it. He's right. We can make a pile of dough Vinnie. When you've got natural talent, it's a crime against God not to use it. That's right. You're a killing machine. So kill. Goodbye Shane. SHANE: Marion. [gunshot] OK you got it? Let's go. It's lucky. OK. I'm ready. Heads. Yow. How do you do that? It's my thing. It's my gift. It's your thing all right. You talked to that guy? You talked to the guy? O'BRIEN: I talked to the guy, the thing. HAUSER: It's going to be at the place? O'BRIEN: How many times you going to ask me about the guy, and the thing, and the place? It's all there. It's set up. You don't got to worry about it. OK, OK, OK, all right Jesus. All right, OK. You ready? O'BRIEN: I'm all set. HAUSER: All right, get tense. O'BRIEN: I'm tense. HAUSER: OK. So, would this be your motor vehicle? Might be. Then you might be Vincent Vasta? Might be. He doesn't look like Vinnie. What's this about? Detective Hauser. Detective O'Brien. So how can I help you detectives? Well, if you're Vincent Vasta, you can tell me where you've been for the last two days. And show some ID. On the other hand, if you're not Vincent Vasta-- which you might not be-- you can tell us where you got this car. And why you switched the plates. So maybe I'm not Vincent Vasta. Ah, hey, OK. That's a start. Look, I bought this car from a guy a couple of days ago. Maybe that's Mr Vasta? [laughter] Vincent Vasta, car dealer. That's very funny. That's hilarious. Ain't exactly his line of work. No, no. Well what exactly is Mr. Vasta's line of work? Hmm. What would you call what Vinnie does? Um, button man. Button man? Hit man, hired killer. You get the picture? Jeez. Let's uh, let's see your license and your pink slip. And your registration and insurance. Et cetera. Sure guys. It's in the glove box. Why don't you go for it. Yeah, nice and easy, eh? You're not really cops are you? Cops? Did, did we say we was cops? That we did. But you guys showed me your wallets and everything. What did you do to Vinnie scumbag? I killed him. Yeah? That right cowboy? Big goddamn mistake. Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time. Just like this. [gun shots] Why'd you kill Vinnie? He was trying to kill me. That sounds like Vinnie. You realize I'm going to have to kill you? Well, you're more than welcome to try. Okey dokey. [gun shots] [gun shots] Where the hell were you? I was out. That's just great Shane. Or should I say Vinnie? I'm sorry. I should have called. Damn right you should have. Look, I know you have problems, but you're going to bring those problems to Jason and to me. JASON: You asked to see me? Yeah, yeah. Come on in. Sit down. So. How long you known old Vinnie? Well, I used to live in Hong Kong. That was about 10 years ago. Pretty tough fellow, huh? Tough enough. Has he done any pro fighting? Uh, not that I know of sir. It's just that, just that I asked him about it the other day and he got real tense. Seemed as if I touched a nerve. OK Jace, let me get to the point. As you know I do a little fight promoting on the side. Strictly underground, no big deal. And I've got a feeling from watching your pal Vinnie that he could be a hell of a fighter. We'd make a whole lot of money. You want me to talk to him. [laughter] That's why I like you. You are smart, Jace. You're smart. Yeah. Talk to him. Convince him to take on a few bouts. Sure thing. I'll do my best. Jace, you'll do better than that. You see, because I'm going to be very disappointed if your friend Vinnie turns me down. You know what I mean? I just hand;e disappointment that well. It's always been one of my biggest character flaws. Yeah, well don't worry sir. I'm sure he'll come around. OK. Shane. Shane, I didn't mean to kick you out or anything. It was just-- You were right. You're always right. And you're always late. You know, I got a way of bringing trouble with me wherever I go. Maybe if I take off, I can get out of here before I drag Jason into it, and you. Look, I'm sorry. Yeah, me too. Look, tell Jason I had to go. No. Why don't you go and say goodbye yourself? All right. I will. Hey. Hey. Where you been buddy? Jason, I'm leaving. What do you mean? I'm leaving here. I'm leaving town. Moving on. Whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't go now. You just got here. Listen. Mr Bender wants you to fight for him. He's got a little side business, and he thinks you can make a lot of money. Look. I already told him. I'm not fighting anymore. Come on, come on. At least just talk to the guy, OK? One last time, before you go. Maybe he can convince you. Oh, Jason. For me. Just do me this one favor. Talk to the man, OK? Then you can, you can go your own way. All right. I'll talk to him. Great. Follow me. 62,300. Yeah. Thanks. Bye bye. Look Mr Bender, I'm good. I won't fight. I've had enough of it. I came in here as a favor to Jason, but-- No buts. What's going to happen if I call the police, Vinnie? Or should I say Shane? I recognized you the minute you walked through the front door. Go ahead, call them. I'll be gone. They'll never catch me. And neither will you. Well I think I've got somebody here that'll make you change your mind about that. Get in here fellas. Well, well, well. If it isn't little boy lost. How you doing in Vegas momma? It's a little hot for me. Nah. It's going to get hotter. Who are these guys? You didn't tell me anything about this. Jason, meet Abdul. Second rate fighter, a third rate hood. ABDUL: Pleasure. This changes nothing Marks. You can put a dozen of these guys between me and the door, I'm still walking out of here. We'll see. This is crazy. Nah. It's going to get crazier. Run. Get the hell out of here. Get the hell out of here. [gun shot] [gun shot] SHANE: No! [gun shots] Aw man. [inaudible] drive faster, now. I'm going, I'm going. Aw yeah. Catch him up, damn it. Catch him! [inaudible]! Shoot him. [gun shots] [gun shots] Slow down. [inaudible] I got you. [tires squealing] Don't worry. I won't hurt you that much. Thank you. [tires squealing] [gun shots] [gun shots] Are you OK? They told me Jason was dead. [phone ringing] BENDER (ON PHONE): Is it done? Yeah. It's done you son of a bitch. I've got two of your men down over here. Why don't you come and get them? I've got a better idea hot shot. Why don't you come here and just give up? No, no, no. Why would I do a thing like that? ANGELIQUE (ON PHONE): Help me Shane. He'll kill me. Please, help me. Tell you what. Lets just call a truce. You lost your friend. I've lost some friends. And let's just leave it at that, all right? So what's the deal? I'll stop gunning for you and I'll give you Angelique if you agree to do one last bout for me. We'll split the take, go our separate ways. All right. If that's what it's going to take to end this, I'll see you in an hour. Here. I have a friend who lives out by Hoover Dam. All right, that will do. You stay there until you hear from me. What if I don't? You will. One way or another, you will. You know how to use this? Yeah. You taught me, remember? That's right. Look, we better get moving. Good luck. You too. Relax Mr McQuade. Tonight, you will make us very much money. Yeah. Boy, the suckers really paid to see a fugitive murder suspect fighting, on pay per view. What an angle. What about Angelique? Son, we have over a million dollars in advance promotions. And that even counting the side bets. You all right? Oh, she's fine. And ain't nobody going to bother her as long as you're a good boy. Yeah, you are going to be a good boy, aren't you Mr McQuade? I think Mr McQuade has learned his lesson. He seems almost-- Contrite. [laughter] Good evening. Tonight I'd like to say welcome and thank you to all the beautiful memories of our exclusive, closed circuit pay per view system. For tonight, I'm going to bring to you a most awesome spectacle, unavailable from your local cable operator. You see, a week ago, in another ring in Hong Kong, in the aftermath, two men lie dead. And what is the cause? Shane McQuade, formerly of Hong Kong, and currently Interpol's most wanted. Tonight, he's rematched against the same fighter he faced and defeated before that bloody massacre. I'm talking about the Moroccan public enemy number one, until he found a hobby, kickboxing. The dreaded Abdul Sabbah! Tonight's the night. Yeah it is. This time, it's for real. Huzzah! All right! Uh huh. Yeah. [bell rings] What the hell is this? [inaudible]. Yeah This is stupid Abdul. Are you a fighter or a killer? We're both killers. If I win-- If you win, they're going to throw you in the ring with another killer. These people are maniacs! This has got to end. There's only one way for this to end. [sound of swords clanging] And now you die. [sound of sword falling] It's all over now. It's finished. This is the end. Finito. [gun shots] [gun shot] Get that helicopter here now. They're on their way. You've done well. You've earned your half. Half. You're kidding, right? Go ahead, take it all kid. But remember, you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life. How do you know I'm even going to let you live? [gun cocking] I'm a killer. You are a killer Mr McQuade, and a talented one. But, not of the cold blooded variety. Two old men, unarmed? No. You won't do it. [gun cocks] [laughter] Good luck kid. Until we meet again. [gun shot] [gun shot] [gun shots] [dogs barking] Shane. What happened to you? I killed a few people. This is for you. I don't think so. Uh uh. See, I tailed your ass all the way from the arena because I knew your hands would touch that dough. All a set up, right? Right from the start. You're a sweet guy Shane. Not too smart. Yeah, I've heard that. You want the money? Here. Here it is. Sorry Shane. I had to play along until now. But it's all over now. We can go away together with the money. Forget about her. She's the past. I'm your future. I don't think so. You said I wasn't very smart. Maybe you were right. I didn't mean it. I was just kidding. I'm smart enough to stay away from you. Take a walk Angelique. Take a fist full of money. Hell, take it all. Just go away. Uh uh. It doesn't work that way lover boy. If you don't come with me now, you don't go anywhere. What can I say, I don't handle rejection very well. Drop the gun. [gun shot] [gun shot] Well. I guess it's goodbye again. What if I want to come with you? No you don't. You need a chance to start over. We could start over. Shane, I could have got her. Why did you stop me? A week ago, I killed a man. I broke his neck. And since then, once you kill someone, your whole world changes. You change. You were always right. You were always late. [thunder] [music playing]
