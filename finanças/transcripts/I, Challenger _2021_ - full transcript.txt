This is Sasha Molotov, coming live to you, straight from my bedroom. Today, we're going to meet Sergei Rutka, who reads lot of stories online about self-burial. Yikes. He decided to try it for himself. He was convinced that burying himself would bring him good luck and prosperity for the rest of his life, forever. Let's check it out. [pig oinking] So, I watch these vloggers, these dudes, they do it on the internet. Poof, next day, they get money. Poof, next day, they got girlfriend. So, I say to Ivan, "Ivan, put me in a box. "We both share in this fortune, no?" I help him. [accordion music] All right, don't be imbecile. Don't fuck this up, idiot. Next day, he come, he dig me out of box. We walk down the street, down there, I see envelope. 50,000 rubles. 50,000. Then, I enter this contest. God damn, bro, we won a refrigerator, brand new. Wow, I'm glad everything worked out for Sergei. Whew, next, we're going to meet Olga Volkov, a girl who knows luck and will do anything to get it. [Olga speaking in foreign language] [Translator] I was very scared, but I managed to conquer my fear and endure the whole night underground. [coffin creaking] [coffin thuds] [theatrical shriek] [Olga speaking in foreign language] When I came out, I had no luck for a week, but then, I landed the perfect job and found Dimitri, the man of my dreams. [Olga speaking in foreign language] Be a millionaire. [laughs] [cash register chiming] So, everyone knows Maksim and Mikhail. [water splashing] I bet that you didn't know that they also did this challenge. [speaking in foreign language] [Translator] I've been down here for 12 hours so far. I feel so, so scared, but I have plenty of water. I can't wait to get out and be a rich playboy. That's crazy. [Translator] I'm feeling a bit claustrophobic, but if Maksim can last all night, then so can I. Oh, my gosh. So scary, oof. Thankfully, it's the reason of all of their success. All of it. Let's take a look. [speaking in foreign language] [Translator] We model three years. No job, we do self-burial, and boom, everybody wants us. Inground pool, bitch. We won so much money. You can, too. Ah, yeah.

If I'm your lucky star, you're fucked big time, okay? - Usual numbers? - No, not today. Let the machine pick. Let me try my luck and go totally random. Great attitude. [News Anchor] The jackpot is simply too hard to resist for those who rarely play. [lottery machine whirring] The California jackpot has been record-breaking in sales. Remember, you won $500 before? Maybe $5,000 this time. Your lips to Buddha's ears, buddy. You know money won't buy you happiness, Sid, right? No, but it'd sure buy a lot of weed. And weed makes the world go 'round. - Sounds like 420 to me. - That makes the odds 292 million to one, and the chances of winning don't necessarily increase the more you play.

Thanks, Mom. What the fuck are you doing here? I have to tell you something. You will not believe it. Did I invite you here? Well, no, I was just stoppin' by. You forgot to mention the part about living with your mom, by the way. [sighs] Guess that makes us even on the bullshit. We play video games online together. We are not friends. I helped you out last night because I felt sorry for you, man. I don't need a friend in real life. Can I just tell you why I came? - Bro. - It's important. It was your idea. Okay. You said I had to find my own luck, right? Yes. Well, I found it. [upbeat electronic music] Look. People in Russia are burying themselves for 24-hours, for luck. It's a 24-hour supervised self-burial, and it works, bro. People are gettin' all kinds of lucky, gettin' jobs, finding money, girls, all kinds of shit. Shh! Okay, and? And, and I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna bury myself for 24 hours, and that's how I'm gonna find my luck. It worked for all those people in the video. - You're crazy. - I'm serious. And I want you to supervise it. You're gonna bury yourself in a box for 24 hours, because you think it's gonna bring you luck? Do you hear yourself, man? It's a hoax. Look at the videos. It works. Okay, that's it. You gotta go, okay? Get your shit and let's go. Come on. Go, go. [phone chimes] Here, I sent you the video, just watch it. - That's all I ask. - I'll watch it, I'll watch it, please, just go.

It looks good, though. - You think so? - Yeah. Oh, thanks. Um, 30 grams of the usual, please. The usual? All right. Um, this new batch is a lot stronger, okay? So you gotta be careful. You know me well. The stronger, the better. I prefer to be comfortably numb. Yeah, well, that'll cheer you up for sure. Oh, my God, that's beautiful, look at that. Oh, my God, yes, please. [V] [laughs] It's good, right? - Yes, I'll take this, please. - Okay. My friends are gonna love this. It's always best when it's shared. That's sweet. Good guy. $200. - That's for the Kush. - Thank you. - This is for you. - Thanks. Wow, you look amazing. I mean, your hair, the blue. Oh, wow, really? Yeah, it matches your eyes. I really like it. Thank you, thanks. I just, I did it the other day. - Really nice. - Thanks. What happened to us going to coffee? Oh, my God, that totally slipped my mind. I'm so sorry. Slipped your mind. No, I would love to get some coffee with you. All right, this is the second time, so don't lose this. I promise, I cross my heart. Thanks, V. [chuckling] Have a good one, Sid. [dramatic music] [grunts] [groans] [door thuds] [dramatic music] [inhales deeply] Oh, sweet Jesus. [inhales slowly] Oh, damn. [lighter clicks] [coughing uncontrollably] [dramatic music intensifies] [yells] [yells out uncomfortably] [static buzzing] [cries out fearfully] [static continues buzzing] Shut the door, asshole. [panting] [groaning] - He better be here this time. - Yeah, for real. Seriously, I'm not coming here again. [door knocking] [lips smacking] [door knocking] Tammy, Tina, my favorites. What's up, cutie? Peachy. What's up? The last time I saw eyes that red was Bram Stoker's Dracula. Very funny. Wanna smoke us out? [exhales sharply] Nah, I'm kinda tied up. Come on, we wanna get high. Well, I feel ya. You can always buy somethin'. We're broke. Can we just get a couple grams and square up tomorrow? No fronts, ladies, sorry. Please, we'll be really nice to you. You girls are teenagers. What do I look like, Captain Creepy? Just one joint. Just come back later when you guys get some cash, all right? [door thuds] [Both] Loser. - I heard that! - Good. - What the fuck? - I know. Big, huge. [keyboard clicking] [electronic music] [door knocking] [exhales loudly] [Girl On Video] Watch me twerk. I told you no freebies! Uh, sorry. Thought you were somebody else. My name is Joan, and this is my son, David. How are you today? I'm Sid. - Good, thanks. - Hello, Sid. We're visiting new friends in our neighborhood today, spreading the word of our good Lord. Our goal is to save as many souls as possible from the inevitable upcoming disaster. - Disaster? - Armageddon. As written, it's not a question of if, more a question of when. You see the signs on the news, global war, nuclear threats from foreign dictators. It's a matter of time, Mr. Smith, or can I call you Sid? No, Sid's fine. That's pretty dark. Well, that's why we're here, to offer you a way out of the darkness. Uh... I'm not in the dark. We all are. I read the Bible. - So, you're a Christian? - Agnostic. [speaks in foreign language] I can clear that. So, you're open to the possibility of God. Well, anything's possible, but I prefer science. It's real, you know? Graspable, tangible. No god has ever done anything for me. It's so hot. I'm very sensitive to the heat. May we continue inside? Uh... My place is a mess. No judgment here. Sure, why not? Come on in. [faint R&B music] Please, have a seat, sit down, sit down. [Girl On Video] Do you like my big ass? [laptop thuds shut] Uh, my portal. [bells dinging] Hey, what if an alien came down? For everyone to see, in broad daylight? Would that disprove the existence of God? Well, that's not gonna happen. Really? How do you know? That's science fiction, Sid. Outside, you said that God's never done anything for you. You know that you have to ask Him for help for Him to answer the call? Yeah, but God only saves you when you die, and none us knows what happens when we die. God knows. [scoffs] See, you gotta believe to get in the after party. To me, why can't the planet, the solar system, the universe, be God? God is everything. He is in everything. Hm, God, good, devil, evil, isn't it that simple? Believe in something greater, conquer our fear of death, and add meaningfulness to the void? [dramatic music] Aren't we God, the makers of man? [door knocking] I'll get it. It was nice talking with you. We'll meet again later. Inspiring stuff. Holy shit. It's my friend, Logan. Nice talkin' to you. Nice talkin' to you. - Who were they? - I don't know. Some church. - And you let them in? - Yeah, just for a minute. You got problems. Can I get a joint, please? For you, I'm gonna get a fresh one. One J. Your idea, bro. Pretty brilliant. Oh, what idea? The 24-hour supervised self-burial challenge. Oh, yeah, right. I told you. Did you watch the videos? Yes, I watched the videos. Do you think it'll work? Yo, you don't even need luck for this shit to work, man. What do you mean? That's the whole point of doing it, for luck. Sid, listen to me. Those Russian videos, they have millions of views. Some have 10s of millions. Do you know what kind of money we can make with those views, man? No. 10s of thousands, okay? Nobody in the states has made a self-burial video. We can be the first. I mean, do you know what this means? If this shit goes viral, man. Damn. - Even if I don't get lucky- - We just got lucky. - We? - Yes, I'm in, bro, 110%. I'm gonna help you make the video. We can even livestream it to my Facebook and YouTube. It's set up with tons of followers, man. You have followers? Over 1,000. Damn. Sid, this is huge. This can bring us millions of followers, and millions of new opportunities. Okay, what do we have to do? Well, first, we shake on it. 50/50 on all the monies made. [scoffs] 50/50? I'm the one going in the box. - [dramatic music] - Relax. It's my gear, my channel. You wanna do it on your own, unsupervised? All right, then you have to supervise the entire thing, all 24 hours. You can't leave me down there alone. I won't. And I can't go into that box not knowing if I'm gonna be homeless when I get out. If this goes wrong, and I get evicted, I need somewhere to go, man, for like a month, until I can find another place. Like your pad. You have gotta be kidding me. [voice breaking] I can't do it otherwise, man. [panting] I'll die of stress. Okay, okay, all right, don't die of stress. I'll talk to my mom. Your mom likes me. Hey, watch it, okay? I'll talk to her. This means a lot to me, man. It really means a lot to me. I got you. We gotta dig a hole and build a box, all right? I'll come back tomorrow, and we'll get started. I can't believe we're doin' it. [chuckles] I got you, man. - I'll see you tomorrow, okay? - I'll see you tomorrow.

No, I feel you, man. We shouldn't do a coffin. - That's just- - It's like, feet are tied up, just like when you found me. All right, so, we gotta get a pipe, drill a hole, and stick it in the top, so you can breath. Shit, I almost forgot about that. You will run out of air, definitely, and you will die, so let's not have that happen. Yeah, I don't really wanna die, man. I don't want you to die, either. So, do you know where we can get a pipe from? I have a couple pipes in the back. Didn't think I was gonna use them for breathing, though, but fuck it. Perfect. So, where are we gonna get some wood from? Let's get the pallettes on the street. People leave them out all the time. - Really? - Yeah, and I got a shed-full of tools in the back. Perfect, hammer and nails, we'll get it done. All right, so, I'm thinkin', you know, a little somethin' like that, you know? We set up a camera here, maybe one there, and then we're good to go. [Sid] Maybe one more on that corner. On this one, too? We can do that. - Pipe, so you can breathe. - To breathe. Obviously. I'll take a little bit of that. And you have all the materials? So, this is all the materials we need right here?

Kinda spooky, digging a grave on a full moon. Hey, fuckin' stop with that shit, man. What? Sorry, it is. That's not a grave, it's just a hole, all right? Well, that's easy for you to say. I'm the one that's gonna get in the box. Yeah, but you're gonna be alive. I am gonna be alive. We're doin' this for luck, man. - All right. - For luck. [grunting] There's gotta be an easier way. Yeah, bro. A Splatter-dozer. [Both] Splatter-dozer! - I wish. - Did you bring a joint? - I always got a joint. - My man. Oh yeah.

Yeah, I believe in the money gods. I believe in the money gods, too. I just wish they'd show themselves. After we're done with this, hopefully, they will.

[shovel clanking] Yo, I'm beat, man, I need a nap. Well, that's it. I'm done. Should we get the box? Well, can't it wait a couple more hours? Oh, come on, man, this is all part of the challenge. Yo, we've been up all night, man. Come on, we gotta get this done before anybody else. [sighs] All right, whatever. Come on, let's go. [grunts] Let's go. You know what you need is some coffee. [Logan chuckles] All right, sorry. Okay. [straining] We got it. [drill whirring] Look, the cameras have WiFi, so they'll livestream to my social platforms and record everything simultaneously. Technology, insane, right? Yeah. Now, the livestream, you can't see everybody, but they can see and hear you, so the more you interact with the camera, the better. Five feet, should be three feet above ground. Should work. - Hey, you feel that? - Rain. Said it was in the forecast for tomorrow. Let's get goin'. [lid creaking] - You got it? - Yeah. There's some bricks over here, careful. All right. All right. [grunts] One second. [grunts] All right. [grunting] All right. Here we go. Gentle, gentle. I think it fits. [straining] Just a little more. Yep. [box thudding] Look. [Logan chuckles] [lid thuds shut] How's it looking? Oh, yeah. Should we smoke one? - [chuckles] Yeah. - All right, let's do that. [lid creaks shut] - Looks good. - Headed your way. [exhales loudly] [panting] Let's see. [under breath] 24-hour supervised self-burial. All right, looking good. [toilet flushes] [exhales quickly] - Yo. - Okay. I'm all good. Hop in the box, I'll test the picture and the sound. I'll put all my crap in there. All right. [Sid exhaling loudly] - You got this. - All right. [ominous music] [lid creaking] [lid thuds shut] There you are, perfect. [Sid grunting] And away we go. [box thudding] [Sid Over Livestream] Not too bad. [chuckles] I'm running a test on the livestream now. Everything looks good. - I'm not buried yet. - Well, as good as. You know what, here, take the air pipe. Fill in the hole, let's go now, come on. - Why the mad rush? - Bro, I'm already in here, I got everything I need, we already have the live feed, come on, let's just go. Let's rock and roll, bro. Okay, all right, all right, fine. Before I lose my nerve! Come on, let's get this party started! How's that, good? Woo, I can see! [chuckles] All right. [dramatic music] [sputtering] Logan, careful, man! It's raining sand in here. [flashlight clicking] [box rumbling] [exhaling loudly] That's right. Come on, you can drink the water. [exhales loudly] [mumbling to self] What's goin' on? What's taking so long? Yeah, I'm gettin' there, buddy. - How you doin' down there? - Doin' pretty good. I got some dirt in my mouth, but I'm good otherwise. Ah, you'll be all right. I'm sure you've had worse things in your mouth. [Sid] Yeah, actually, I have. [chuckles] [shovel clattering] All right, bro, it's lookin' good. [shivers] It's freezing down here. Yeah, it should probably warm up when the sun hits the yard more. Okay. You're right, I'm good, then. Yeah, bro, I think I'm all done. - Logan. - Yeah? It's freaky as hell, bro. [chuckles] Look, you'll be fine, all right? I'm gonna go inside now, but I got the cameras on, so I'll be watching you, okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I got my phone. I'll call you in a few. [dramatic music] It's not so bad. More room than I thought. I mean, it's a little cold, but that's all right. The cold doesn't really bother me all that much. My boy, Sid, camera A. Hi, everyone. If you can see me, my name is Challenger, a.k.a. Sid, Sid Smith. This is my 24-hour supervised self-burial challenge. [viewers laughing] I'm gonna be in this box for the next 24 hours, underground, buried. Insane, right? - That's right. - And I'm doin' it for luck. I know, I know, it sounds crazy, but it works. [laughing] If I don't die of an anxiety attack in here first. [inhales deeply] My bro, LoganRun, is supervising and running the live feed. Thanks to him, [inhales sharply] I'll be safe. Yes, sir. Let's see. 23 hours, 50 minutes to go. Stay tuned, anything can happen. [Viewer] He's crazy. [laughs] My boy. I'm vaping in my capsule. Oh. [imitating rave music] [viewers chatting] I am vaping in my capsule. [coughing] Holy shit. Yo! Thank God, I needed that. - [Sid coughing] - Yo, Sid! What's up? Yo, it's 200 people watching, bro! - 200, no way. - Yes! Look, just keep doin' what you're doin', the chitchat, everything, bro, it's killing! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Hey, you guys, it's 200 people watching right now, because probably you've never seen someone bury themselves before. Stay tuned. [viewers chatting] All you have to do is commit. Stay committed, right, Logan? Yeah, my boy! - Yeah! - I'm goin' back inside, baby! Woo! [Sid] Woo, woo! [viewers chatting] [viewers laughing] - ♪ I, I, I, I got my hashpipe ♪ - Oh, shit. Sid, you have got to see this. [viewer groaning loudly] [laughing] Okay. [dramatic music] Wow, 1,000 followers. [exhales loudly] Thank you, everybody, for watching me do this challenge. It looks insane, but if you're searching for luck, or trying to make some money, like me, then this could be the thing for you. But get help, you can't do this by yourself. I'm not superstitious or anything, and I don't know how it works, but just go online and search, "24-hour supervised self-burial." Okay? Watch the videos. You'll see what I'm talkin' about. Damn it, I forgot to charge my cell phone and bring a pillow. Well, that's what happens when you start a challenge to beat the weather. [laughing] Yo, yo, I got a gift for you. What's up? [coughing] What are you doin', man? I'm hotboxing you, bro. [coughing] Stop, man, I can't breathe! [viewers laughing] Stop it, you madman! [coughing] See you later. [Sid coughing uncontrollably] [viewers chatting] [laughing] Look at you, Sid. Yeah, but you know what? This sure feels good. Don't try this at home. [viewers laughing] LoganRun is a crazy ass fool, but I know he's only doing it out of the kindness of his heart. Thanks, bro. [vape pen bubbling] [sighs] [Viewer] What is this? In a box? [snoring loudly] They're burying themselves? What is this? [viewers chatting] [viewers continue chatting] Not talking a text, not talking a call, can you see them okay? [snoring loudly] [watch beeping] Yo, Logan. Logan? Where'd you go? Did you disappear on me? Logan? Did you fall asleep? [ringback ringing] Come on, man, answer your damn phone. [phone vibrating] Oh, shit. Yo, hey, sorry, man, I passed out. What's up? Dude, you totally disappeared on me. No, man, look, I would never leave, all right? I was just in a Kush coma. - [watch beeps] - We're six hours in. Oh, shit, yo, it's 10,000 people watching right now, bro. - For real? - Yeah, for real. [head thuds against box] I can't believe 10,000 of you are watching. I hope you're all enjoying my challenge. We're a quarter of the way through now. Man, the comments are going crazy, man. It's like a feeding frenzy. Just keep doin' what you're doin'. Really? All right. I'm telling everyone out there watching to listen to me. This shit works. [viewers chatting] If you want luck, then you know what to do. [sighing] This is crazy, man. Look, I gotta go take a piss, but I'll be right back, all right? [vape pen bubbling] [coughing loudly] [Sid shrieking comically] [computer alert chimes] [toilet flushing] [dramatic music] 11, 18, 80, three, 15, what the fuck?! Holy shit! Sid! Sid. Woo! Woo! [phone ringing] Unknown number, could be some more luck. [phone beeps] This is Sid. [Vanessa] Sid, hi, it's Vanessa from L.A. Kush. Oh, hey, V, all right. Um, how'd you get my number? Um, it's on file here at the store, and I got kinda worried that you lost my card again. [Sid] Oh, no, no, I had your card, I was gonna call. Mm hm, sure you were. Well, now, you don't have to. What are you doin'? Oh, you know, I'm, uh, kind of in the middle of a challenge right now. A challenge? Yeah, I'm buried underground, doing a supervised self-burial for good luck. Wait a minute, you're buried underground right now? Yeah, we're running our own livestream on YouTube and Facebook, check it out. LoganRun is the page. Oh, okay. And you know what? I'm really glad you called. I'd love to see you when I get out of here. Ditto. I knew this challenge would work, and the fact that you just called just proves it. [chuckling] That's very sweet, Sid. [Sid] Seriously. All right, well, be careful? Keep getting lucky, and call me later, yeah? I will. Talk to you later, V. [viewers chatting] [exhales loudly] Anyone who tries to tell me that this challenge doesn't work is full of shit. My luck has already changed, and that phone call just proved it. You hear that, Logan? See your boy in action? Mr. Cool Breeze, makin' it happen. [dramatic music] [ringback tone ringing] [panting] I don't get it. [viewers laughing] Did you fall in the fucking toilet? Call me. [viewers chatting] [ringback tone ringing] Dude, pick up the phone. My battery is dying and it's starting to rain. [ringback tone ringing] If only he was there when I was getting weed, dude. Like, holy shit, now he's just gonna die? This is not a fucking joke. You're meant to be supervising me, man. Call me! [ringback tone ringing] - The guy evicted this guy. - Now, it's getting serious. [Viewer] Did you get the link I just sent you? Logan, bro, pick up or respond! [grunts] We talked about this! [sighs] Fuck. [viewers chatting] Logan! I thought that when I was in the box. [laughing] Logan! [viewer laughing] Fucking Logan, man. Logan! Let me out of here! You gotta fucking come back! Logan! Okay, fucking calm down. Calm down, catch your breath. You gotta relax. I'm fuckin' freaking out, man. I'm fucking freaking out. [phone ringing] [Vanessa] Hey, it's Vanessa. Hey, V. [Vanessa] Um, I saw you were having some issues. Can I help you with anything? Nah, it's okay. It's just my flakey friend. Probably crashed out. He was up late last night. [Vanessa] You sure? 'Cause watching you is giving me anxiety. How do you think I feel? I'm the one in the box. [Vanessa] Okay, call me if you need anything, all right? I'm watching. Okay, I will, thanks, V. [panting] Momma! Momma! Woo! Mom! What? [panting] [laughing] Why are you panting? What is it? What's it look like? Don't be smart. Where have you been all night? I was at Sid's. Look up the winning numbers for me, please. No, Mr. Lazy, you do it. [scoffs] Okay. [computer chimes] Compare 'em, Ma. Okay, okay, hold on. - They match. - Yes. We're rich. What do you mean, we're rich? This isn't real. Yes, it is, Ma. Where'd you get this from? Well, uh, I bought it. Logan, you don't buy lottery tickets. Who's is this? Okay, Ma, Sid bought it. You stole this from Sid, Logan? Momma, you know I wouldn't steal, okay? I was bringing it to you to ask you what you think I should do. It's $300 million, Ma. Think about it, seriously. There is nothing to think about. This is Sid's ticket, you need to get it back to him. Where is he? Let me out of here! Mom, I ran all the way over here, $300 million. I need you to take this ticket back to Sid, it's his. Here, now, get moving. Get moving. [panting] [crying softly] [grunting] [viewers chatting] Let me out!

Mm hm, fuck outta here. Sorry, man, I don't want no trouble. [door knocking] Hey, Sid. Sid, you home? [dramatic music] [straining] [Viewer] I mean, he's fine, right now, but I don't think he'll make it out alive. [viewers chatting] Sid? You here? Sid? Shit. [door thuds shut] [panting] Okay, okay. All right. Come on, Sid, come on. Where you at? [computer chiming] Ah, there you are. Okay, okay. [ringback tone ringing] Yo, yo, Sid, are you there? Fuck! Where the hell have you been? 6 hours, what, are you ghosting me, man? I'm sorry, but, bro, listen to me, I have some good news. - [viewers chatting] - I don't give a shit. I've been down here freakin' the fuck out here, and you just disappeared. Bro. You just take off and leave me. I could've died down here, bro. Sorry, my phone died. Listen to me. You're not gonna believe it. Let me get a word in, man, listen. [Sid] You broke your promise. Did you get my messages? Yes, bro, I got all 20 of your messages, just shut the fuck up and listen to me. - No! - Yes! [thuds loudly] What, jerkin' off? My luck's been goin' through the roof. Girls are callin' me, it's freakin' unbelievable, but were you here to see it, no. Do you give a shit, no. I could've died down here, bro. [viewers chatting] I don't think I can handle another anxiety attack. [viewers clamoring] [viewers chiming offline] Logan. God damn it. Logan, I lost you. My cell phone's fucked. It's all wet, I lost you. Come out to the pipe. Oh, fuck. Fuck. Logan, come out here!

I, um, I don't know if it's my phone or not, but I can't see the livestream anymore, so, um, Yeah, I was just calling to see if you were doing okay. Ah, cramp! [cries out painfully] Um, I hope everything is going great in the box. [yelling indistinctly] Ow, ow! And, um, hit me back. Let me know that you're good, that you're okay. Okay, bye. [phone beeps] What do I sound like? Jesus. [loud creaking] [children faintly laughing] [ominous music] [gasps] Sidney, it's not your fault. I don't blame you. Mom and Dad don't blame you. Go away. I forgive you, Sidney. [dramatic music] Sid. Sidney. It's not your fault, Sidney. [child screaming] [thunder rumbling] [police car beeping] [police radio chatter] Logan, did you move it?

[Operator] When you are finished recording, hang up or press one for more options. [voicemail prompt beeps] Fuck. [cries softly] [panting] Hey, hey. I don't know if any of you are still watching. I don't know if any of you have stopped now. This challenge is too hard. It's freezing in here, and this thing's filling up with water. Oh, shit. [panting] [camera static buzzing] I think I need help. I think I need someone to come in here and get me out. [cries softly] Sid! Sid! Sid! Help! Logan! Logan! Logan!

I was watching the livestream, it ended really abruptly, I called you a bunch, you're not calling me back. So, um, I know this makes me sound like a nervous ninny, I'm just, I am really worried, so I went to the store and I got your address, and um, I'm just gonna come to your house. Okay? To check on you, make sure you're okay. Unless you call me back in the next few minutes. So, if you're okay, call me back. Bye. [phone beeps] [dramatic music] Haley Lee's coming over tonight man.

[Logan] The back, go around back. What the fuck? Yo, there's some dude hogtied in there, told us to go around back. [Logan] I got a cramp, man, help! Fuck! What do we do? - Help him. - Help, I can't move! Wait, are you sure? There's a dude tied up in there! That's not Sid. We don't know what the fuck's goin' on in there. Sid could be in trouble. Sid's a drug dealer. Do what you want, I'm not gettin' involved in this shit. I'm out, Daeg. My parents will kill me. Pussy, man, we gotta help! [dramatic electronic music] [door thudding] - Hello? - In here! What the fuck? What happened? - Who are you? - I'm Vanessa. I'm Sid's friend, you're Logan? - Yeah. - Yeah, okay. Untie me, scissors, in the kitchen on the floor. Scissors? Okay. [grunting] I got it, I got it, I got it. My hands. These were a pair... - Hang on. - Oh, fuck. - Thank you. - Where is Sid? He's in the backyard. He's buried! Come on, help me. Ah! Sid! Shit. Oh, my God, the pipe fell. It's flooded. - Sid! - Sid, can you hear us? Sid, are you there? Oh, my God. Shovels, dig. Come on. Oh, shit. - [grunting] - You guys are insane. He could be dead. It was his idea, the fool wanted to get lucky. Lucky? Who tied you up? Don't ask, just dig. - Sid! - Sid! - Can you hear us? - I'm comin', buddy! [dramatic music] What the fuck? - Help us, please! - Help us! Hurry up! What do you want us to do? [Logan And Vanessa] Just dig! Sid! - Sid! - Can you hear us? Sid! Sid! - You ready, you ready? - Yeah. Pull, pull, pull. [all straining] [All] Sid! - Sid? - No. No, man, come on, come on.
