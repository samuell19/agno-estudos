My child. Come to me. Come to Mommy. Hurry. Come to me. Come to me, my child. Let's all sing together. Don't hate your friends. Just once in my life. Let's go on a long voyage. Love each other, my friend. Be happy, my friend. Is the tape jammed? Do you want me to untie it for you want me to untie you? No, I'm fine. I'll do it in a minute. Let's just use the MP3. Who listens to Walkman now? It's all going to be broken by you. Try this. It's delicious. Delicious, isn't it? Delicious. Delicious, isn't it? That one. What did you do last night? Why have you been sleeping? Hey. You sleep with Jae-hyun last night. Isn't that right? What are you talking about? Am I right? Hello?... Look me in the eye. I'm sure you did. Stop it. All right, I won't say it. Having fun? All night- Oh, my God. I really won't. I really won't. Don't worry about it. Don't.... That guy's been like that ever since the beginning. That pervert. Where are we? My neck. Are you on the wrong track? - Where are we? Where are we? I don't think it's here. Nothing. Chief, is this the right place? The sightseeing bus fell under the bridge. Bodies found in damaged buses. The windows are broken. There's luggage and wreckage everywhere. The condition of the damaged vehicle shows what happened in the event of an accident. A bus that fell from a twenty-one meter cliff, has been damaged, carrying 36 people on board. The bus was going downhill when it hit a guardrail and fell into a stream. It's because the slope is too steep. You woke up too early. Don't be afraid. Nothing's gonna happen. My child. I have a baby in my belly. I know. It's a girl. This kid will have a brother. They'll be twins. The twins will have countless brothers and sisters. We'll make it. What do you mean? Girl, it looks like you really don't know who you are. Or are you pretending? It doesn't matter. You probably don't know. We're with you. The place where my aunt lives is good. That's nice. What's that? Where did that come from? That's what happens when you come to the old woman's house. General manager, The view here is amazing. How did you find this place? I should've stopped by more often to say hello. I shouldn't have missed you so long. You must be busy taking over so many new jobs. It doesn't matter. I can't believe I've drawn so many pictures. You drew all of this yourself, didn't you? Don't you want to hold a solo show? It's a shame to leave the ashes like this. I heard there was an accident in the lab. Yeah, early this morning. You're being too direct. It's not like there's a problem with headquarters. Yes, we do. We got a little problem at the lab headquarters. No, it's not. It's not a small problem. It's the headquarters that's been breached. Talking to you, who is already retired, about these problems is a little inappropriate. But you were in charge. There are some things that you still need to know. Who could have done this? It's not related to the previous generation's problem, is it? Why do you ask? Chief, your bad taste is still the same as always. You're right. After this group of rubbish destroyed the laboratory, it was scattered all over the place. Chief, aren't you curious about that? Who let those dolls out? What's their purpose? Only a small number of people in the foundation know about the existence of the laboratory. There are only two organizations I can think of right now. The Superhumanist organization, and the Alliance. So it's not on our side. It's on your side, the chief executive. Right? We should investigate to find out right away. No, we won't. We don't have time to investigate our current situation. It's been breached. But from our point of view, it's an internal breakthrough, not an external one. What do you mean? Yes. The child was lost. Not abandoned but lost? Yes, the child was lost. He walked out on his own. It's over. What's the matter with you? Where are you going? Want a ride? You son of a bitch, why don't you answer the question? What are you doing? Get in the car! What are you doing? What are you doing? She's got nothing to do with it. Why take her? Are you a humanitarian? Isn't this the time for you to worry about others? We might have to bury you How can we leave witnesses? We do things very rigorously. How could she be so virtuous? Is the blood on her body real? Hyung, it looks like it's real blood. What the hell does she do? Let her go. She didn't see anything. You're so noisy. She saw this car. I think she even saw the license plate. Cut the crap. If it were you, could you see it? That's not necessarily true. 41 River 0115 Did you really see that? How did you see that? What else did you see? 010－7562－3905 702, 309 Pillar Rock Building It's okay, hyung. This is a set car. Who the hell are you? Do you live here? Boss is asking you a question, son of a bitch! What the hell are you doing? Let her go. Stinky woman, shut up! Gun. You bastards! Don't bully innocent children. Stinky woman, shut up and be quiet! What the hell are you doing? What's wrong with you? Be honest with me, little brat. Let go. What the hell does this girl do? Let go. It's not the crazy guy who lives here. Hyung, I think he's really crazy. Right? She's wearing a mental hospital suit, isn't she? Let go of me! Don't. Stop it! Don't do this. You don't have to do it. Hello, this is 119. May I help you? Please speak. Hello? What's the matter? Please speak. Hello? Hello. Please don't hang up. Come with me. Yes, sir. A little further down the street. An ambulance just passed in front of me. It's not that way. It's the second way. Yeah, that's it. Wait a minute. I'm coming out. Uncle! Uncle! Kyung-hee, who the hell did this? Yongdu, is that the bastard Yongdu? Uncle, we have to go. Come on, come on. Let's go. But who is she? That one. Looks like she's seriously injured. Huh? Nose bleed? That one. Hey! Hey! I'm serious. Uncle, come on. What the hell is going on? Are you all right? Get in the car. All right, good. It's true. Kyung-hee. Yes, sir. How are you feeling? Are you okay? I'm fine. But that son of a bitch, Yongdu, is now openly harming people. That bastard should have a grudge. How long has your father been dead? So far, we haven't taken the land. The bidding for the resort is already set. In that case, the subordinates are also the shareholders. I'm ashamed of myself in front of them. How's the kid? What she said, was something that feels particularly strange but not so strange. What? No, no, it should be fine. No matter how amateur I was, I used to be a man flying all over the street. When I was a kid, I saved your dad many times with this hand. But don't you have to call the police? Her wounds are unusual. It always feels like a girl with a story. That's why I'm even more afraid of calling the police. Well, that's true. It's not good for us to associate with the police. And it's hard to explain the situation. I'll take care of her until she gets better. Yeah, just do it. Captain, are you all right? Why are you shooting again? Scared the hell out of me, motherfucker! I can hear you if you keep your voice down. How many fucking times have do I have to tell you? I can hear you fine with these receivers. You don't need to yell! I'm just finishing up with a smoke. Send in the clean-up girl. Fuck! Come on, Chief. Are you gonna do this every time? If you keep insisting on going alone, you're gonna die. Do you have a death wish or something? You should have waited for me. You plan on keeping us without backup? Then you should have hauled ass. I need to wrap up before the church members show up. What? Chief, you're the one who's setting the meeting time. Yeah, yeah. Shut up and just go. Not this son of a bitch. Why is he so noisy? What's that? Why are you talking shit about me? Why are using Korean? What's wrong with a Korean speaking Korean? It's nothing. You're just fucking loud. You still have that notebook around. What happened to the iPad I gave you? I'm old-fashioned. I don't need the latest gadget. Then give back the iPad. You don't even use it! And that was the latest model. This motherfucker is really- Don't be an Indian giver. And I use it, I do. For what? I've never seen you use it once. To watch Netflix before I sleep. Fucking Netflix? I've been paying a big money for that.Fucking waste. Whatever. It's been put to good use. Shut up and just go. This fucking bastard.. You did it on purpose, didn't you? Kaesaeki? That's a curse word right? Kaesaeki? That's a curse word right? That's the F word, right? Yeah, that's a swear word. F word again! F word! F word! Guns stepped on the accelerator again. You're swearing as usual. Hey, I told you not to drink in your mouth. What are the glasses for? I think I use it when I drink. Hey, boy, boy. What's wrong with you? Is that Yongdu? No, it's not. He's my brother's brother. It's okay. It's okay. Don't do that. Let go of me, boy. You son of a bitch. Looks good. But who is she? She's the sister I know. He'll be staying with us soon. How long have you been in Korea? Do you have a sister already? I didn't know you were a cow. It's like a cow. Have you eaten yet, boy? I'll fix you dinner too. Bad boy. Let's get dinner ready. What's the matter? You don't have an appetite? It's not that I don't have an appetite, it's not delicious. He's a real kid. Then don't eat it. If you say it's not delicious, you still put the food in your mouth. Is it because of the taste? Just eat hard to survive. I'm really this kid. It hurts. Of course it hurts you to beat your kid. Your kid has been to my sister recently. Talk back, kid. Or else I'll step on your nose and face. I said it hurts. Don't do this. Don't do this. Don't do this. Can't you say anything that tastes bad? Just heat up the instant rice. I bought soup at the supermarket. You need to be cleaned up today. You impolite son of a bitch. Don't talk back, kid. Don't do that. What are you doing? Let go of the kid. I said don't do this. Let go of the kid. I said don't do this. Now you are. Did you just push me? I asked if you attacked your sister. I'm so sick of it. What? I hate this house. When did you run out? Dad didn't come back until he died. What are you talking about? You know you're funny? You're the one who said you hated running away. He said he didn't want to see Dad, so he ran away. My father's land. When did you ever care so much about Dad? Since when is this your home? This is my room when I was a kid. You can stay first. This one. I think so. Put it on. Put on your comfortable clothes and go to bed. Then rest. Tell me if you need anything. That one. I forgot to thank you. Thank you. Thanks to you, I survived. Get some rest. Get some rest. The official name of the experiment is lab data point. It's written as ADP for convenience. It's going to take more than 40 years. Children of the benchmark for this project. That's what my sister and the superhumanists wanted. A complete version of the model. They've been looking for it for a long time. Separating the ontogenetic genes and attempting to reproduce it. One of them is this kid. Koo Ja-yoon is still missing? All I know is that after leaving here, she showed up at the last lab last month. The chief let go of the children he had found. Actually, I was a little surprised. She's better than I expected. But Ja-yoon was also traumatized here. So it's supposed to be inoperable for a while. And she has weaknesses. Her brain depends on drugs. She can't do much to us all by herself. But this kid's different, isn't she? I don't know what kind of monster it will be. It's always overflowing in this world. It must be removed. If the company knows about this, both the chief and I are fucked. It's supposed to break up our heads. It's used as a base for experiments. I see what you mean. Think of it as paying off my debt from 10 years ago. Then I'll go. Just in case, they planted chips in the lab kids. It keeps track of the state of the brain. There's still room. It'll help you find her. But this one doesn't seem to work. How do I use it? Do you know how to use this? What? It's almost broken. Stop licking. It's dirty. Captain, can we do this? I mean... He's not doing well. He's doing informal activities. And that thing seems to be the company's main asset. What's the matter? Nothing. Then go home. Don't you worry? Did you hear what Chief just said? And the kids in the lab, I had contact with them 10 years ago. They're cruel monsters. No, that's not it. Stop talking nonsense. Get them. They're starting to get in the way. It's them, isn't it? He's been with us since we came to Korea. So what? Hurry up and grab it. Wait a minute. What is it? Looks like a local agent. First of all, let's calm down. Don't make a scene. I didn't know you were working here. Let's talk first. Nice to meet you. What are you talking about? That's a little harsh. Do you have to? Stop it. Tell your boss to come and see me. There's a bus card. It's right in front of the bus stop. Let's go back. If you have something to say, just say it. But did our captain know their boss? Very familiar. Is that the boss before the captain? Yes, ten years ago. It was a long time ago. Good thing. Yes, fortunately. But why all of a sudden? Uhm.. That's right. Why not? Don't you like men? Yes. That's why I... What, you son of a bitch? Son of a bitch? You're calling me names again. Too much swearing in Korean. Don't talk to me in honorifics. Me? Yes, you. No, absolutely not. I think it's because you're upset. So where are we going now? Wait for this signal. Keep it open until you get a signal. Wow, it's really primitive. You know how big this island is, don't you? Don't you know? Listen carefully. It covers an area of 1,833.2 square kilometers. It's like finding a needle in the ocean, you know? Are you listening to me now? My child. Come to Mommy. Come on. Come to Mommy. It smells like cow dung. We need to level this place as soon as possible. Is that Kyung-hee? Long time no see. I'm Yongdu. Remember me? Stay right there. Hey, there. Your father used to use it for hunting. You should keep it at the police station. You can't just leave it at home. It's illegal. By the way, you're from America. America It's a place full of guns anyway, isn't it? But where's everybody else? You're the only one who's holding that thing up. What are you talking about? What kind of weapon do you carry? Four of my men are now semi-maimed. Life is at stake. My men are clamoring to call the police. My uncle stopped me for a long time. Hey, Kyung-hee, are we strangers? Family business has to be handled by a family. Don't involve outsiders. That's not gonna work, you know? By the way, didn't wonderful father teach you that? I'm asking you. All right. All right. Well, that's all. Well, let's talk a little bit today. Say what? I have nothing to say to you. Hey, you've got that. Shut up. But have you ever shot anyone? Let's go. Don't come near me. I told you not to come. You hear me? Bring it here. Let me go, motherfucker. - Be honest. - Let me go. Let me go, motherfucker. I ask you to let me go! You scared me. You dogs! We're the best soldiers in the world. Who's this kid? Who are you, smelly kid? Get out of here, motherfucker. Don't hit my brother. You fucking dog! Hello? Hello? Are you some kind of baseball player? - Don't hit him. - Hey. Don't touch my brother. Hyung, there's no one in there. What, really nobody? Hey! I don't think Kyung-hee takes my uncle seriously. You're gonna use this gun to get rid of all these bastards? What kind of crap do you keep talking about? All right. After all, Chul-ho and I are loyal. Let's pretend nothing happened between our children. It's a thing of the past anyway. What can we do? So just sign the contract and put your fingerprints. What the hell are you doing here? Do you want cows or sheep? Besides, did I ask you to give it to me for nothing? I'll give you a little more than the market price. Just take the money and go to Seoul. Why don't we go shopping and have a date? Then I'll have a nice life with my brother. Now my parents are gone. You'll have to take good care of your brother from now on, won't you? The house of Zhao, I won't give it to you. How many times do I have to say that? Hello? I've told you so much. Why don't you give me a sincere answer? Why are you so bold? Your father is dead. But what's going on now? Are you denying reality? I know. My dad's dead. Didn't you kill him? You killed my father you bastard. I've been patient with you for a while, but you don't hold back. Close her mouth. Looks like she's gonna have to be beaten. That's fine, as long as her fingerprints are intact. Stop fighting, you bastards! Let go of me! Hey! Daegil. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Daegil. Stand up, you son of a bitch. Come here. Come here. Come here. Stand up, you son of a bitch. Come here. You son of a bitch. That son of a bitch is getting on my nerves. Do you have to be beaten to get your act together? Say it. - Don't move, you son of a bitch. My boss is talking to you. Where are you looking? I'm scared to death. Who is she? It's dangerous over there. Get down. Come down here and be careful not to get hurt. Hey, get down here. How did she get up there? Why do kids these days have so much guts? Hey, hey, hey. - Crazty woman. Dangerous. Be careful not to fall. What's she doing? What are you waiting for? Hey, hey, get down here. What is it? The circus? What the fuck? Did you just see that? What's that... Are you here to visit? Do something about it, you bastards. Don't come near me. Don't come near me. Don't come near me. Don't come near me. Get out of here. Don't come near me. Go away! Go away! Get out of here. Go away! Go away! Forget it. Forget it. It's about time. I'm all right. So stop fighting. Let's go. Don't come again. Got it? I'm telling you to wake up. Take your men down to the hospital. Wake up, you son of a bitch. Okay, I'll get my act together. Let's get out of course. Go on, go on, go on. Does it hurt? Are you okay? Hey, who is she? What did I just see? Just calm down. Actually, I don't know. Look at her. What? Is she really an alien? It's not a cover. That was a scene from the movie. How did you know her? It's amazing. That's amazing. How long will she stay at our house? May I speak to her? Should I take a video and send it to YouTube? I'm sure you made a profit. What are you doing? What are you doing? It's not you. Are you okay? Are you sure you're okay? Ouch. What's this? Take it off. What are you doing? Answer me, brat. Sister, don't do this. Can you introduce her to me again? You really have to get along with people like that. That's amazing. Who is this? Isn't that Sergeant Cho? Long time no see. That's a good one. I thought they were thrown away somewhere. Looks like he's got a little conscience. Is it because of faith? Well, I have faith, too. And you can't throw it away anywhere. It can pollute the environment. We should love the Earth. You look as good as ever. You're still handsome. As you know, these things are born. And you're still handsome. His eyes are as sharp as ever. Let's not talk about the past. What? Yeah, all right. Well, let's forget it. All right, then tell me something else. Why did you come back so suddenly? I didn't think you'd ever come back. You know what you're asking. Of course I know Chief called you back. But why did you come back? What? Is it because of that thing? Chief is in charge of that thing. Now that we've relegated to the second line, just stay honest. Why are you doing this? What's wrong with you? Is that thing? Are you doubting me? Can't say a word. How dare this damned bitch suspect me? Hey, Koo Ja Yoon, that bitch! The last person I'm looking for is Chief. It evaporated silently after that. You think that's it? Koo Ja-yoon looted Hoffen Glass and Bangkok Labs, before coming to Jeju Island. And then she robbed the Shanghai lab, you know that? It's a high-level experiment. The drugs are all gone. Plus, the lab's headquarters was stolen. How dare you suspect me? Hey, just get out of here. If there's anything to do with that thing, It won't do you any good. I don't care about that company's group. How do I fight behind your back? I'll take care of it. Don't get in my way. If I keep being followed, and it gets in my way, I'm not gonna sit back and watch. Oh, my God, you're such a man speaking in a murderous tone. Come on, let's not see each other again. Let's go our separate ways now. Hello, Hyun Joong. Hey stinky girl! We haven't seen each other in 10 years. Are you sure you want to leave? What else do you want? You want to talk about 10 years ago? Don't go. Take your time. Be careful when they turn the car around. This woman has a really bad temper. Are we almost there? Around there, right? Well, it's almost there. The island isn't as small as I thought. Oh, it's so boring. Hey, look at this, too. It's funny in Korea. It's funny. Watch it. Watch it. How do you always watch that? What's the matter, bitch? Don't kill yourself, will you? Watch your mouth, or I'll rip your fucking mouth off. I'm just kidding. I won't argue with her again. Let's do it. Let's see who wins. What's the matter? We fought one when we were kids. Was that when you were a kid? What do you say? Have a fight. Well, that's him. How on earth did he survive? He's got a bullet in his head. How on earth have you lived to this day? Logically speaking, at this level, you should be completely dead. Is that right? You think I made a mistake? No, no, absolutely not! How can something happen to noona's ability? That's not what I meant. I mean... One small piece of fresh meat. For the sake of your cuteness, I'll spare you. You're right. It should be cut off completely. Wait. Come on, let's eat. That's a good kid. Is it good? It's on the floor. What about this, Abby? Come on. What is it? No, it's not. No, what are you doing? Hello, quack stinky old man. Are you still seeing a doctor? You are cruelty to animals. And... Didn't I say that if you'd see the underground deal, I'll take your hand off? No, you didn't. These days, I really only treat cats and dogs. And it's just a prescription. I can't do the surgery anymore. Really? Then your hands won't work anymore. Yongdu. No, Mr. Hyun Joong. Why are you doing this to me all of a sudden? I won't tell. I'm really not gonna tell you the story. Be quiet. It's so noisy. Shut up. You should have something to say to me. Say what? Kyung-hee's little girl. The story about the girl. You must have something to say to me alone. Right? She's the one wanted. Looks like it. Who's the continuing owner? Did you get in touch? Yes, hyung. I got the message. Wow, that's funny. It's exciting. That's it. This is Youtube where they'll upload videos of them eating. Keep uploading. If someone clicks in to watch, and has a decent number of views, then we'll get the ads. If you get an ad, the money will come. If you have a lot of fans, I earn hundreds of thousands of won a month. Hey, you there? You're listening. Anyway, they're just making money from eating. You just have to turn it upside down once. Then we'll be rich. What's this? Which one? This one? Mixed noodles Is it good? It's delicious. Shall we go eat this? Yeah, let's go eat. No, are you listening to me seriously? What's this? Which one? Oh, hot dog. Next to it is pizza. Is it good? Hey, are you listening to me? Are we going to eat this too? I'll get you a hot dog later. I'll give you some pizza later. I asked if you were listening to me. What's this? Are you an eater? Why are you so greedy? Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Forget it. Stop it. Stop it. Let's try abalone porridge. It's on sale today. This is a little hot. Take your time. Careful not to burn your hands and easy. Hey, hey, hey. She's finished. It's all gone. Hello? Hey, Hey, hey. Hey, wait a minute. Hello? I'm sorry. I'll do it as soon as I can. What a shame, don't eat it. Do you have aliens in your stomach? They say I can eat whatever I want. You can eat, but you have to eat in moderation. Is that how your planet is run? Where's my sister? GAMOR. Hello. My sister's at Uncle's animal hospital. Uncle's a little hurt. I'm sorry I left in such a hurry. Why don't you guys have dinner first? I'll be there as soon as I can. Would you like some water? It's no use now, though. But that's enough to stick. Kyunghee, That kid, Just let it go. I can't be with the kid. While Yongdu hasn't caused any trouble, let the kid go. We're gonna have to hand over the land and the house, okay? Come on, let's go. Daegil should be waiting for you. What? Hi, there. Who are you? Don't be so scared. Talk to us. I'm going for real. Where have I heard all that talk? You can fly and throw it out with your bare hands. I'm going for real. It's a girl. What? I don't know, man. About 17, 18. I'll go. You know what her age is for. Are you going on a blind date with her? Didn't I tell you? There's only one girl. No need for that. I went and bought a couple of guns. Hello? Hello? Hello? What's with the phone? Hello? I'm going. That's a new phone. Close the door. But who are you? Who is it? You guys contacted us. Ah, the girl is the one who.. Although it's a bit messy, you'd better sit down first. Come on, let's talk. Where is the girl now? You're gonna kill me if I tell you're gonna kill me, right? No, I won't. Isn't that right? If you don't tell me, I'll kill you. But if you tell me quickly, I won't torture you. I was going to let you look at the organs in your body slowly and in detail, just like he did, and then I'll kill you. You haven't seen your own heart, have you? Right? No, I haven't. I'm not a cardiologist. You don't have to look at that. I can't even look at that's what I'm supposed to see. But that one. I'm sure I'll be of some use. I'm sure there will be. It's a shame to just kill him. I'm not a freeloader either. After we talk, we should be able to figure out our interests. Isn't that right? You tell me. I'll give you a present if I'm satisfied. Here, here, here. This one, this one, this one. See? See? See? She's Koo Ja-yoon, a country girl. It's not a song. I don't think you're gonna make it on YouTube. Why don't we go on this show? If you go, you'll be able to explode like Koo Ja-yoon. Hey, you can't eat rice. You eat a lot, don't you? But I've never sung a song. Hey, you really... Just go to the karaoke and practice for a few days. Compared to this, other than picking people's joints and throwing the car out, What else would you do? Just like her, be gentle. Do something. Let me get you some pizza. It's not the same size as before. Big? Can I have fried chicken with the side dishes? And I'll give you some pasta. Spaghetti? Are you a special? It's not that funny. If you laugh like that.. What's this? It's kind of pretty. No, no, no, no, no, no. Hey. Stop laughing. What are you doing? It's not like that anyway. That's going to be like this, isn't it? Are you kidding me? Right? Hey, don't do it. Let me take a good look. Try it. Try it again. Do it right. Let me see. Try it. What? I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go. You're amazing. How did you do that? Hey, hey, wait a minute. You can't unplug that antenna. The antenna cannot be pulled out. You need to watch TV. Put it down. Put it down. I'll go. That's crazy. That's amazing. Did you destroy that star just now? Is it possible to be this crazy? Oh, that's not it. But where did you learn to say that? You have a gift. What? What? What? This is really the kid. What did you see? She's a monster. I don't know when she'll mutate. If you don't want your brother dead, just listen to me. Let's set the time of the clock. The fireworks are about 30 minutes away. If you don't handle it in the meantime, The noise will attract the attention of the police or civilians. It's gonna get bigger. Let's go. But, Captain, If only her brother were to be taken out, Does the girl feel strange? What if she finds out she's running away? Just pray she doesn't find out for a few minutes. Why don't you go? I need to cover the captain. Bullshit. Who's covering who? You don't have to go. Captain. Captain. Captain, wait for me to go. Put glutinous rice balls on top of the rice and stutter. What's that? Really? That's funny. Did she find out, Captain? I told you not to talk into my ear and to curse. Curse. I'm going for real. I really want to kill you. That's right. Fireworks. There's a fireworks festival today. What time is it? It's time. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Let's go. Fireworks? It's so pretty. Don't you know that your planet doesn't have it? Let's go over there. It's so beautiful. Aren't you going? Daegil. What's the matter? Let go of her hand. It'll be out soon. Get ready. When you see them coming out, keep your distance from the guns. It's the captain. Sister, what's wrong with you? Run away. What are you talking about? All of a sudden. I'm sorry. Run away! I'll go. What do those guys do? Captain, look behind you. They're from Shanghai Research Lab, right? Who are you? Didn't I tell you not to come here again? Yeah, yeah. Kyung-hee took out that pole again. But we do, too. Can you see what's going on inside? She's on her way to the roof. But the boy was with her. I'll go. Keep one's distance. Come on. Hey, can you see there? There. That's the main road. Can you get there in one go? Go, go, go. I'm going to my sister's. You go. Hey, there. You'll be back, won't you? Come back when things get better. We're going to karaoke. I'll order you pizza every day. We must meet again. Where's the girl? Who? What girl? Bullshit, impolite woman. What? All right, go to hell. Sister! Sister! My sister! Sister! Sister! My sister! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Sister! Sister! Sister! Did you find anything? No, Captain. Nothing. I wonder if it's been blown up by two missiles. There's no such thing as that? No, I didn't. But... But what? There's something else here. Sister! Sister! Sister! I've had enough of your family. There's a lot of kids like that, and they're gonna have to fuck with me. I'm going to fight you, you fucking bastard. I'm gonna kill you myself, goddamn it. Why am I so sorry? Did I kill your father? Hey, do you know why your father died? He tried to kill me, but he died. You know what? I've been loyal for 15 years. Did you know I won all this land with my body? You don't know, do you? What are you doing talking to this kid about? All right, you go with your sister. What a pain in the ass! Before I get angry, you guys go. It's not your turn to come to such an occasion. What? Do as you please? How can you decide for yourself? Why are you ruining my fun? I'll go, Captain. Did you see that? She's not in the same position as the others before. Shoot me, you son of a bitch! I'll go. I'm dying. Hello? Run away! Come on, let's go! Where the hell are you going? Don't make me upset. Go to hell. Captain, again. It's new. - I'll go. - Oh, my God. That's how you keep telling me to cover for me. Move aside. It's brand new. Hello? Wow, it's you. That's weird. I'm sure I've smashed your head. How did you survive? I'll take your neck off this time. Captain. How are the kids? Captain, what are you doing? He's an ordinary man. You're lucky. I'm scared. I saw it. Didn't you pee? I'll go to the monsters. It's quite unexpected. Is it different from what it used to be. That's a bad breed, too. There's another one. You son of a bitch. It does hurt. But what use does this have for us? What is it? She's ignoring us. You're alive. But... Back then and now. She doesn't look very good. Who the hell is she? What's the big deal? You monster. You. Finally. Long time no see. Don't mess with me. But do you know each other? I understand. How did we met? She was born to live alone in the laboratory headquarters. She's my sister. I told you to release my sister. Who told you to kill her? Jo-hyun. Ah them? I sent them to you. He's from Shanghai, China. I was a little hurt. If you mess with me, I can't handle it. That's why I asked me a favor. But I wasn't sure if it was you at first. You've been bullied by them. My sister can't be like that. So I don't think you're planning on leaving. But here. I feel you. It's a bit awkward all of a sudden, isn't it? Yeah, we're only together when Mom's in the womb. I was born apart. Did you just let me out? Yes, sir. Why not? Because I need you. You need me, too. So why? If you want to see Mom, I've heard of it. You and Mom's mind are connected. Mom's been looking for you, hasn't she? She won't look for me. Let's go with my sister. You're treating your sister too coldly after a long time. Are you in pain? You know what it's like? I want to save them. You can do it. But there's no way to save both. You choose. It's just that no one can be an ordinary human being. Are you all right? Wouldn't it be better to die as a human being? Go to your mother's with your sister. The children met in the end. They'll be looking for their mothers soon. How do you draw it like this? Then let's get ready. Don't be silly! There's colored eggs at the end. I almost suffocated. They're gone. Let's go. Captain. Captain, they're gone. Captain, they're gone. Captain. Captain! Captain! Captain! Captain! Captain, wake up. Captain, can you hear me? Captain. What if you just die? I'll go. I heard your voice. Those monsters still have to hear your voice. The children were taken away. What are you doing? Help me up. Let's go. We have to go after them. Give me your cell phone. You memorized my cell phone number. What's the matter? I thought you said you'd never see me again. Since when have you been there? You don't care when I got here. Just get to the point. Yes. I never wanted to see you again. But the situation does not permit us to be backed up. Why should I help you? You doubt me. That's mean. Are you still trying to figure that out? You're not a baby. Well, that's a good idea. So what do you want me to do? - I'll go. - Oh, my God. Are you going to keep talking like this? Hurry up and catch them! My phone's a new. Don't worry. I know where they're going.
