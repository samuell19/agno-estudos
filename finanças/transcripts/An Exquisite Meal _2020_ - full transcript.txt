- What? - Nothing. You said you weren't going to drink tonight anyways. - We can go get something else. - We already rang the doorbell. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Hey! - Hi! Welcome. Thanks for having us. Of course. Oh, your place is amazing, Where did you get all this art? - We just got back from India. - Really? It's beautiful, isn't it? The rest is from Africa, Bali. - Some pieces from China. - Mark, look at this stuff. I'm gonna dropped this off in the kitchen. Hi! Oh, hugs are okay! Oh, I'm sorry! I didn't know. - What are you drinking? - We have wine, whiskey. I'll have whiskey. Um... I'll... I'm going to hold off for now. Come on. Have a drink. I have this scotch. We just got back from Scotland. Small batch. Only a couple of hundred bottles. I don't even want to tell you how much we paid for it. - How much? - $100 a bottle. I'll just have some wine if that's okay. Okay, coming right up. Hmm. We got you something else. You didn't have to! Oh! It's very nice. Thank you. Here we go. Look at what Beth and Mark brought us. Oh. Very cool. Thank you. We should put it up. Yeah, let's find a spot. How are the drinks? The whiskey's good. Peaty. Very peaty. That is a Chateau Pontet-Canet. - I hope you like Bordeaux. - Yeah, I love it. - You do? - Yeah, the city and the wine. Have you been? Yeah, actually, when I was studying in college... - I've got a new job. - Oh, you left the store. - Her boss was a creep. - It's complicated. Should you... Mark thinks I drink too much. What the hell? I just got a new job. What the hell? This is the one this is the one from China. Yeah, look at the little gold flecks underneath. Is there something? It looks like - there's something in there. - There's like a hinge here. - I should like... Careful. - I don't want to break it. - Oh, it's a... - It's a TV. Of course. Jesus, they have cable and Apple TV. How do they watch it. None of the furniture faces... What do you think? - How's dinner coming? - What is for dinner? I thought you'd never ask. Should I tell them? I have prepared an exquisite meal for you this evening? Organic pork tenderloin with chartreuse, compressed peaches, dry melted leeks, chanterelle mushrooms with golden fig and seared foie gras with lavender pork reduction of the chef's own divining. Wow. Dave knows a lot about food now. - He's an excellent cook. - Chef. Excellent chef. You should see his knives. You know, I really should have told you beforehand, but I'm not eating gluten now. - You're not? - I hope that's okay. When did you stop eating gluten? This morning. You had a pastry for breakfast. I know after that I did not feel well. I can put the bread on the side. - Oh, that must be Charlie. - I'll get it. Hi, can I help you? Yeah, I'm here for the party. Yeah... You must be one of Annie's friends. Yeah. Annie, I am a friend of Annie. Yeah, of course. Come in. Sorry about that. I'll be fine, one cheat day won't kill me. It's your first day. Annie's on her way, right babe? Oh yeah, yeah. Are you a friend? - I'm a friend of Annie's. - Irene. - Paul. - Mark. - Paul. - Beth. Paul. - Oh, and I'm Dave. - I'm Paul. - I'm a friend of Annie's. - Great. She's running behind. She'll be here soon. Paul, can I get you a drink? I might have a beer in the fridge? - Well, how about some wine? - Yeah. Wine, sure. - I have red wine. - Just red? Oh, we have some white too. Oh, I meant cabernet, merlot? Sorry. Actually, it's a Bordeaux. It's very tasty. - Well, I'll try some of that. - Great. Anybody else? I'll give you a hand. Please. So, Paul, what is it that you do? I'm an electrician. Oh, what's that like? I like it, all right. It's actually very trendy right now. I'm writing a piece about how people are returning to more hands on work. How did you get into that? So glad we found another couple who do this kind of thing with. You know, it's hard to find the right kind of people. Oh yeah, yeah. Hey, I hope Beth can eat everything. Oh, don't worry about that. She'll have a new diet by the time we're done in here. - How are you guys, by the way? - You know, we are... We're a lot better lately. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. We started couples counseling. Well, you seem a lot happier. How's your work going? Let me show you my knives. Uh... yeah. - Oh yeah. - Got a full set. Paring, peeling, cheese, bread, fillet, carving, cleaver. - Cuts right through the bone. - Yeah, wow. Yeah, cool stuff. I'm upgrading, though. We know this place on Randolph, where all the shots in Chicago get their knives. Go ahead, take it up. Feel the blade. Go ahead. - Just side to side sharp, huh? - Yeah, very sharp. It's the same brand Grant Achatz uses, Global. - Oh, wow, the guy from... - Alinea, Next. Yeah, he's a fucking legend. Told you it's sharp. Were you always passionate about electricity? I never thought about it that way. Do you own your own business or...? Yeah, I have a small company. I have a few guys who work for me. My son helps out. Okay, so you're an entrepreneur. Paul, here you go. That is a Chateau Pontet-Canet. Hmm. It's good. - It is, isn't it? - Yeah. Mark, Paul's an electrician. Oh, well, yeah. I'm... half Hispanic, so. Oh, nice. We can all use another drink. Hmm. I have this new app that makes for organizing calls so much easier. Oh, Dave is addicted to podcasts. I do spend a lot of time in the kitchen. What's the one we had on in the car? - Serial? - No. Oh, Serial is fucking amazing, though. How have you guys not heard of that? - It's almost as good as TV. - Wow. I just started listening to this new one. It is so funny. - Which one? - It's these two guys, and they do this social experiment where they - stop masturbating for a year. - Mark! What about you, Paul? Do you listen to a podcast? Yeah, no, I like to listen to podcasts. Hmm. Like what? History mostly. I like Hardcore History. Oh, I've heard that was good. And politics, I like to listen to political podcasts. - Oh, are you like... - Oh, I almost forgot. Paul, I hope you're hungry because I have prepared an exquisite meal for, well, for everyone this evening. Organic pork tenderloin locally sourced and responsibly raised, of course, chartreuse compressed peaches, dry melted leeks, chanterelle mushrooms resting on an ethereal bed of golden figs, seared foie gras and a lavender pork reduction of the chef's own divining. It's a meal that moves the earth when you eat it. To paraphrase Hemingway in For Whom the Bell Tolls. - Robert and Maria. - Yes! He gets it! You get it. Yeah, they made love and the earth moved. Oh, did you, did you read that in college? No, just for myself. Have you read anything good lately? Yeah, I just finished The Brothers Karamazov. I love the Brothers Karamazov. Russian stuff depresses me. Wasn't there a show based on that? I don't think so. No, it's a novel by Dostoevsky. What am I thinking of? The Russian show you were watching? The Americans? Oh my God. The finale. I'm sorry. I don't like reading subtitles. She jumps ahead of me. - He travels for work. - You're in logistics, right? That's not who I am. Oh, what about, have you guys seen the show Master of None. - That's the one with... - Aziz Ansari. - He's great. - God, have you seen it? I've heard that it was great. But then Aziz became problematic. So true. I mean, there's so many good shows on TV these days. - I know! - It's like... It's... Excuse me. - Hey, stranger. - Hi! - How are you? - Good, good. - You look great. - Oh yeah, you too. I'm actually working on a piece about non-traditional roles in child rearing. Oh, you mean like a homosexual? - Mark! - What? No, I didn't... That's... You know what I meant. Right? Well, more couples are deciding to have kids without getting married. And there's an interesting shift in gender roles as well. Mark and I were just talking about this for us. Are you and Dave planning on having kids? No, we don't want to have kids. - Oh, why not? - It's not - It's not that I don't like kids. It's just to not have all the time, you know? To visit when you guys have kids, - I'll babysit. - Dave doesn't want them either? No, he doesn't, actually, we... I don't know. It's complicated. Well, Mark and I are going to have a baby. Oh, are you? That's wonderful. - Congratulations. - Yeah, we're going with a sort of non-traditional approach. - Okay. - Are you adopting? Um... artificial insemination, actually. Oh, are you...? Am I what? - Like... - Barren? No. Oh my God, no, everything's working fine. We just don't want to want to, um... To conceive in violence. Yeah, we want our baby to be conceived under peaceful conditions. To avoid the connotation of rape. - Well, it doesn't have to be... - Even the slightest overtone. It just, it creates a safer gestation environment for the child. As long as it's consensual... It's the same as you wouldn't want to grow up in a war zone. Well, we don't want our baby to be formed in a traumatized womb. Can't you just be gentle? - Well, there's... - Always the... - The connotation. - Exactly, the connotation. Have you read about this somewhere? - I haven't read about. - It's new. So, is it going to be your sperm? Well, I would assume it is. It is. - Yeah. - We're discussing it. Well, it should be. Maybe your article can help us decide. Anyway, the bottom line... We're having it done by a really wonderful doctor. - He's Chinese. - Mark! Cecily recommended her. Is that how Cecily had her baby? No, this is new. Well, that's wonderful, really wonderful. - Dave? - You have guests. Yeah. Yeah, Hi, everyone. Hey, everyone, this is our friend, Annie. Sorry, I'm late. Nice to... Okay. Oh, and of course you already know Paul. - Oh, hi. - I'm a friend of Annie's. Oh, hi. You haven't eaten already, have you? Oh, no, no, no. You haven't missed anything except some rousing conversation. Beth and Mark are going to have a baby, Dave. Whoa. Wow! That's fantastic. Really happy for you guys. - Congratulations. - Thanks. - So are you... - No, not yet. We're still exploring our insemination options. Oh, of course, yeah, I mean, there are so many options these days. It might not be his sperm. Oh, I see. - How's dinner coming, babe? - I'll check. That's me in Gaza. That's the wall at the West Bank. - Wow. - Hmm. Interesting. Yeah, we had a great group that day. So you travel around doing yoga? It's for my non-profit Yogis Without Borders. Wow. We do yoga in places that have been ravaged by war. There's the border wall. Seems dangerous. Everyone was really nice to us. Gaza heavy stuff. I'm going to Iraq in the fall. Oh, really for the, um... is that still going on? - I think so. - Where's that? - Oh, that's my flat in Paris. - Oh, Paris. Dave and I were just talking about taking a trip there. We have an office there. Is that your Instagram account? 22,000 followers. You can stay at my flat. I have always wanted to take cooking classes there. I wish we traveled more. - Why don't you come with us? - We're saving for a house. Paris would be so romantic. - Well, think about it. - How is the food coming, Dave? Yeah, is dinner almost ready? - Yeah, you should check on it. - I'd like to propose a toast to a wonderful evening with friends, to an exquisite meal and to Beth's new job. And to Irene's big cover story. - What's the cover story? - Oh, it's nothing. Her latest article is being featured on the cover of - The Atlantic. - The Atlantic. - The Atlantic. - That's amazing. - Wow. The Atlantic. - Yes, The Atlantic. Isn't she perfect? She's a real writer now. Thank you. It's my first really big piece. - What a great magazine. - Yeah, I know, it's crazy. She wrote a piece about how women in their 30s realize their prospects and settle. Is it based on personal experience? No, not at all. I'm one of the lucky ones. We're not one of those couples. I'm... I am a writer. So, I mean, I'm writing about the society that I see. And I mean, I've certainly drawn observations and... but it's not about us. Yeah. If anything, Irene... That must be, Charlie. - Finally, we can eat! - I'll get it. Hi, yes. I'd like... I'm sorry, could you hold on for one second? - Hey. - Everything okay? Yeah. Why? There's a Frenchman at the door. - A Frenchman? - Yeah, a Frenchman. - So... - Do you know him? I don't think so. Well, he says he's here for the party, but I didn't invite him. Well, is he the sort of person we'd like to have at our party? Well, he looks like a professor and he's French, so I guess he's some kind of intellectual. So let him in. What are you doing in here? My sister's on the phone. Hi. I discussed it with my wife, and you are just the kind of person we'd like at our party. Perfect. You won't be disappointed. - Hello? - Hello. - I am Edouard. - Mark. Nice to meet you. The pleasure was mine. I don't know where everyone went. They've scattered. Have you two met already? This is Mark and I am a French professor of philosophy. It gives you something to define yourself against, you see? - Yeah, I'm with you. - What's he talking about? You say you hate it? Yes, CNN, Fox News. - Doesn't matter. - It matters. - Yeah, I think it matters. - No, this is what I'm saying. The difference is a media construction. You go one way, you go the other. It does not matter. As long as the emotion is there, it gives you something to define yourself against. - You see? - But I'm right to be angry. - We should all be angry. - Yes, of course. But what does it do for you? You're doing nothing. - I'm... I'm... - It gives you an identity. it allows it to exist against something without... - Without what? - Yeah, without what? It allows you to self-identify. Is the absence of anything substantial in you. That's... He's basically defending Fox News. No! I think it's deeper than that. - You're not serious. - Yeah, I see people - fall into this all the time. - Perhaps you too, huh? - No, I know who I am. - Perhaps. I fucking know. Sorry. Hi, I'm calling about... Yes, Irene. Oh, soon. Okay. - Hey, sorry about that. - Everything okay? Yeah, yeah. - My editor called and... - So great about the Atlantic. Oh, thank you. It's been a long road. Whoo! - Yeah. - I'm very lucky. I really need to figure out what I'm doing. It takes time. You don't still smoke by any chance, do you? Um, I think I have some upstairs if you want. - Don't tell Mark, though. - Of course not. Okay, this movie Transformers, have you seen this? - And you? - The first one. Okay, this film, I teach it to my class. It is a great meta commentary on American culture. You see this film, or you don't. It doesn't matter. You hate it either way. You hate Michael Bay and you feel better about yourself. But I haven't even seen the movie. - And? - I hate it. - Yes, of course. - It's just a crass money grab peddling to the lowest common denominator. It is just to make money, that is one level. Just noise and explosions. And there are good movies that people should be seeing. Yes, of course. But my question is, why do you care so much? This thing, it is not beautiful. It is not art. But.... It's popular. So people hate it. It serves this purpose of giving you something to hate. You don't even have to do the work of being something. The movie does it for you. The movie does it for you. You don't even have to watch it. That's bullshit. The same ways you watch the news. - Hi. - Oh. Hi. I didn't hear you come in. So do you have any new trips planned? Just the trip to Iraq in October. - To do yoga. - Yeah. Well, I'm going to go see where everyone is. Nice meeting you. That French guy is incredible. He's got these ideas. I don't know. He's got this outside perspective. It's like he gets the culture. Like how we consume media and... What? Do you know what's up with the other guy? Annie's friend? Is he Annie's friend? - Yeah. Why? - I don't know. He just makes me uncomfortable. Did he say something to you? No, no, no. I don't know, it's just something off about him. Yeah. I feel horrible saying this, but he just... he looks like a loser. Should I get rid of him? Serve him for dinner? No, I shouldn't have said that. I don't know what's wrong with me. You're hungry. Dinner will be ready soon. Perhaps we should go around the table and get to know each other better. A lot of people, they just think of me as Dave from logistics. I daydream about disappearing to a new city and starting over. I wanted to be a novelist. But I've let go of all those things. If only I had something to give myself away to. I worked so hard and still feel so empty. Maybe I could open up a little shop. I'm a chef. I'm constantly thinking of ways to improve myself. A man of influence and taste. The goal of the ego is to not change. Irene, could we have some more wine? The therapy, the drinking. Speak to me in French. You've got it completely backwards. - Irene? - All the sacrifice. Someday I'll show you all how great I am. Irene. I think I'd like some more wine. Irene, wine. Oh my god, I forgot. Sorry. This is not who I am. - This is not who I am. - This is not who I am. - This is not who I am. - This is not who I am. But time moves on indifferently. What happened? He's dead. - Can I help you? - I was just... I was just checking on dinner. What do you know about being a chef? - What? - What do you... know about food? I was just... I was just getting hungry. Hmm... Go ahead. Open it up. Have a look. I don't want to. Go ahead. Looks good. Should we do something? Maybe we should call the police. - Did you see that? - Yeah. What happened? There was a guy just lying in the street. - I think it was a hit and run. - Probably a drunk driver. Do you know what to do, Dave? It's not clear to me. All right. I don't want to be that guy, but... I'm famished. You know, maybe we should eat first. He's right, things might sort themselves out once we eat. Yeah, yeah. Where's Irene? Irene. Dinner's almost ready. Somebody else must have heard it. Someone better equipped to deal with emergencies, huh? Everything, okay? Dave, we're all so hungry. I'd be happy to lead us all in some yoga. It's all very curious, is it not? That we are all so incapable of action? These things tend to work themselves out. Only through a dispassionate analysis. If we can nibble on something, even bread. About dinner, I wanted to say something. Thank you, Irene. What Irene is about to say is, and I'll be honest with you, there has been a small problem in the kitchen. But everything's under control. - What happened? - Is something wrong? Just a slight malfunction with the oven. Unfortunately, that does mean dinner will be slightly delayed from being ready. How much longer? - Only a few hours. - A few hours? Yes. But... Could we order something small in the meantime? Some cheese maybe. No. We're all adults here, aren't we? We are, aren't we? We're all so excited about this amazing meal. - But we're starving. - Hey! Now, I have made an amazing meal for you tonight. I am an excellent chef. You don't go off to some fancy restaurant and order in, do you? No! I don't think so. We've all been through a lot tonight. I'm sorry. Now. We're going to have a lovely meal that I prepared. I'm doing this for you, okay? Have some faith in me. He's right. We should have some faith in him. We know there is a meal on the way. There's nothing to do, but wait, and when it comes. Enjoy it. It will be worth the suffering, huh? - Thank you, um... - Edouard. Edouard. Thank you, Edouard. Let's just have some more wine and live in the moment. Dave, why don't you remind us what's for dinner so that we can more easily bear our hunger? Excellent idea. Thank you, Annie. Let me remind you all that I have prepared an exquisite meal for you this evening. Organic pork tenderloin so succulent you will cry. Locally harvested. Honestly, these pigs look better than you or I. Organic free range non-GMO from pen to table with the most sublime chartreuse, compressed peaches that melt in your mouth. Dry, melted leeks from an Amish family farm. Chanterelle mushrooms snuggling on an ethereal bed of golden figs. Foie gras seared to perfection and a lavender pork reduction so perfect you'd swear that God himself had driven my hand. Excuse me. Irene? Someone should call police, oui. But not before we work on the philosophical implications of the situation. - Beth, let's go. - Excuse me, Mark, right? - Yeah, what? - Have you seen, uh, What's his name? The worker. - Paul? - Yes, that's it. Paul. I want to discuss with him the struggle of the proletariat in America. No, I haven't seen him. - Beth. - He makes me uncomfortable. - Beth! What? - We're just talking. I don't know what to do. You know, she just... I don't know, it's like she's disgusted the way she looks at me. Those are really bad for you, you know? You know, I try to be nice, try to give her what she wants, but... You should leave. What? What do you mean? You should leave. There are two questions, primarily. It's a question of what has happened, a journalistic question outside my formal area of training. But, the more interesting question for me is... was it a random act, an accident? Or was it intentional? A murder has a logic to it, but an accident, it's meaningless. Once more into the bridges. What are you doing? - Where have you been? - Have you seen Irene? what's going on? Did I do something? No, I just wanted a cigarette. - You don't smoke. - I just wanted one. - Beth! - What are you doing? If I did something, I'm sorry. - Can we talk about it? - No, you didn't do anything. I just want a cigarette. All right, we'll talk later. What are you so happy about? I have had a small adventure, my friend. What does that mean? My appetite, it consumes me, to eat so much and then to be empty. It's a paradox. What are you talking about? Sex without love, you understand? - I hate you. - I am nothing. I am just a Frenchman in the kitchen. - I don't really matter. - Fuck you. You crazy fucking people. Fuck you, crazy fucking people. Good luck. What's going on? I don't know, I'm not... I'm not really feeling well. I'm starving and I thought... You thought what? I don't know. Maybe I'd get a quick bite to eat and see if that makes me feel better. - I was going to come back. - I get it. I'm hungry too, but dinner's almost ready. Be a shame to spoil your appetite. Yeah. I can remind you what's cooking again. No, no, I got it. Great. You'll stay then. And I'm not a bad person, I just did a bad thing. You don't think I'm a bad person, do you? - No, no. - Thanks. I wish I had found someone like Dave. You guys are so perfect together. Yeah. What is it? - I don't know. - You okay? Where are you going? Dave. I want to help you. Dave. Let me help you. I love you. No, you don't. How could you? You don't even see the real me. Oh, my God. Where'd you find this? - Shh. - What? If Dave found out, he'd kill me. Okay. Oh, my God. That is so good. You Americans are so sensitive about sexuality. It is very refreshing... To meet a real French person here. The people here... ...they're so boring. Aren't they? You do speak French, don't you? You know, It's not polite in mixed company... You are a dirty coward, yes? Oui. You don't speak French, do you? You are very funny. You know this? You aren't French, are you? I'm just the kind of person people like at their parties. Stop it. Stop talking that way. Are you so different from me? You're a very sad person. You think you're making a difference? Do you think that the poor, the war-ravaged, that they need yoga? I can't believe I slept with you. The problems of war can be solved with a good stretch. That's the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard. My work is important. They sound so convincing, don't they? When they tell you how impressed they are with your work, your difference making. You want to believe them so badly so that your life can hang on to that - little thread of meaning. - Fuck you. At least I did the research. I read the books. I'm a good forgery. You're a factory made trinket. What do you think it says about you that you valued my words more when I had an accent? It's to have the courage to be in on the joke. You're a monster. Beth! - Beth. - What? Don't you think we should talk about this? No, I don't. Not right now. - After dinner, okay? - There's no dinner. What? - There's no dinner. - You... - I thought you were... - You're not French? - No. - Oh my God. All that bullshit about Transformers. I believed you because I thought you were French. - I let you fuck me. - You what? Shut up, Mark! I'm so not in the mood right now! Who the fuck are you? I did you a favor. Annie, are you okay? Annie. Annie? Fuck! Dave, I know everything. Everything there was to ever know. Okay? Oh God. Oh my God. Dave, you're my husband. You're a logistics man. David, please. It's not too late. He was just lying there. What the hell is going on? Dinner's almost ready. What did you do? The man in the bath... I thought he was your friend. No. What the hell is going on? We want our food! - I can explain. - You promised us dinner. Where the hell is the food? - You brought us here. - We want our fucking food. Everyone calm the fuck down! I can explain everything. You just go back out to the living room. I can explain. - Who's that? - Must be Charlie. - It's not Charlie. - Then who is it? Who is it? I ordered takeout. Why? Then what's in the oven? Yeah, what the fuck is in the oven? Open the fucking oven! Oh, my God.
