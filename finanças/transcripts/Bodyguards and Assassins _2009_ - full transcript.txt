Democracy comes from the Greek root "demos," meaning "the people," and "kratos," meaning "to rule." In other words, to govern according to the will of the majority. Lincoln once said, "Of the people, by the people, for the people." It represents the ideals of the future China that I truly believe in. A people's republic. Prof. Yang, will we ever see that day? I know that day will come... even if I don't live to see it. You will! Professor! Professor! The first of the Revive China Society, was gunned down on October 1st, 1901. It was the first political assassination in Hong Kong's history. Hong Kong was once a British colony, a haven for political exiles and revolutionaries. After the assassination of Yang, darkness loomed over Hong Kong. On October 1st, 1906, Sun Yat-sen, aka Sun Wen, left Tokyo on a perilous journey to Hong Kong...

The Qing court will try to eliminate Dr. Sun at all costs. You and your men are our only defense in Hong Kong. We've been waiting for this day! After Cixi placed the Emperor under house arrest at the end of the Hundred Days Reform, I led 300 brothers out of Tientsin to escape persecution from the conservative fraction. Only 30 of us survived. As long as Cixi remains in power, we will fight to restore our honor! General Fang, we're counting on you! Brothers, our day of reckoning is here! Four days from now, we'll fight to the death! - Our time has come! - Yes, sir! Father! Go to bed. Do you remember why we came to Hong Kong? Why Mother died? Why I can't go to school? We've lived in 15 towns over the course of six years. We've finally settled down! Why do we need to run again? One day, we will return home to Tientsin and never run again. I've heard the same lie too many times! KOWLOON WALLED CITY I cried the day I received the Imperial decree! My prayers were finally answered after years of disgrace and humiliation. Thank the heavens for giving me the chance to fight for my country. I'm a soldier, we're all soldiers! Soldiers are meant to die in battle! Brothers, drink up! Death to the traitor! Long live the empire! 4 DAYS BEFORE SUN'S ARRIVAL Rise. Where did he go? He went to Li Yue-Tang's house, then Gao Sheng Theater. Thank you. Thank you. I hear you like to gamble?

Just deal! I can do this. Yes, I knew it! You're going to lose this time! Okay. Reveal! I win! We're closed now! One last round! Good morning, Master. Good morning, Father.

DA-YOU PHOTOGRAPHY Master Liu! Prepare an opium pipe for Master Liu! Master, have you seen that woman before? People say he squandered the family fortune all because of that woman. Nosy! Fellow citizens of Hong Kong! Not far to the north, our fellow countrymen are suffering under the corrupt and dying Qing Empire. My fellow countrymen! The Chinese United League was founded in Tokyo to overthrow the corrupt Qing regime and bring democracy to China! Support democracy! Support Dr. Sun!

Did you have anything to do with it? What were you thinking when you gave him these books?! He's my son, my only son! I was 40 before I finally had a son! I gave him these two. These were gifts for you. I set ground rules when we first met. I provide the money but I don't get involved., I don't care how you waste my money! But how could you get my son involved? What? Do you know what Police Chief Shi told me? The Qing court sent assassins! They have guns! Did you bother to warn me? I'm a businessman! My son will be a businessman! No, you're a rebel! The day you donated your first cent to the cause, you became a rebel! You hired me to be Chung-Guang's teacher! You willingly gave money to the cause! No one forced you! Now you say what's right for you isn't right for your son? I don't care. I'm saying this for the last time. I'm an old man. I don't care if I'm labeled a rebel! But my son a rebel? I will not allow it! 3 DAYS BEFORE SUN'S ARRIVAL I waited all night for you! Did you do what we asked? I promise there will be no police at the theater tonight. Sincerely Chen, I will do my best. Mr. Chen, a telegraph! General! We have news! Yan Xiao-Guo is leading the assassins. He's now hiding out at the Walled City! It's too late! Protect Mr. Chen! Let's go! I told you to step back! - I'm a member of this opera troupe! - Step back! I need to find my father! My name is Fang Hong! Father! One day, we will return home to Tientsin and never run again. I've heard the same lie too many times! What happened? REJUVENATE CHINA We can't find Mr. Chen. Yue-Tang, my brother, we've been best friends since we met eight years ago. I'm deeply sorry for upsetting you today. But Dr. Sun's visit to Hong Kong is extremely important. The Qing court will send assassins. I may be in danger, so I must ask one last favor. If anything happens to me, you must see the mission through. The hope of China rests with Dr. Sun. The future of China depends on Dr. Sun. In China, there is only one Dr. Sun. I bid you farewell. I will fight to the end. Get up! All of you! Outside! The Chief of Police has ordered China Daily to be shut down immediately for publishing propaganda, inciting civil unrest, and disturbing the peace! Proceed! You have no right! We'll fight back! Master Li... Stop fighting! Stop! What's going on? As your friend, I already warned you. I told you not to meddle! You beat up my staff and destroyed the press. How can you call yourself my friend? The Qing court is determined to eliminate Sun at all costs. My British superiors ordered us not to interfere! You're playing with fire. Don't forget you're just a businessman! Have you forgotten that you're also Chinese? Well said! Very brave of you. China Daily published propaganda and incited student protests. We are under British rule! Shut down the newspaper immediately! More than 30 people were killed at the Gao Sheng Theater last night. And Chen Xiao-bai is still missing! How could you let this happen? What has the Chief of Police been doing? Well said! I warned you! Officers, shut it down! I dare you! Arrest anyone who resists! Attention! We will put out the news of Dr. Sun's arrival even if we must do it by hand! Who's that old man? That's my father! Master Li. SELFLESS RESISTANCE LEADER DR. SUN WEN TO ARRIVE IN HONG KONG OCT 15TH HONG KONG GOVERNMENT INTERVENES We've reached a turning point. If the revolution is to succeed, we cannot fight divided! We need a plan that will bring us together. Dr. Sun is coming. Unite the different factions of the resistance and launch a rebellion within the next three years! The very foundations of China will be shaken! We're on the verge of great change! A new world is coming! The great revolution starts here! And we're all part of it! Please trust me. I, Li Yue-Tang, promise to lead you through this! We can still safeguard Dr. Sun! 2 DAYS BEFORE SUN'S ARRIVAL It's your family heirloom. So, what do you want in return? I need you to protect someone the day after tomorrow. All right. Give the most dangerous task to me. Master Liu, don't you want to know who you're protecting? Master Li. What's wrong with falling in love with a woman? You had your pick of women. Why did you have to fall for your father's woman? Stinky tofu! Stinky tofu! Stinky tofu! You have superb fighting skills! I know you. You're the hero, Li Yue-Tang! You put on a good show today! Come. You told off that man who works for the British! I hate cowards who bully the weak! You stand up for the truth. I admire that. Hero Li, call me if you need me in the future! My size helps even if I just stand by your side! How about the day after tomorrow? Who are we fighting? The British? The bad guys! Great! Mommy will buy you this. This one is good. Take care of the child. Why did you sneak into my house the other day? We went our separate ways long ago! Don't bother me or my family ever again! Stay out of my life! Are you done? Master, count me in. I grew up on the streets. I have my shares of wounds, I'm not afraid of anything! But, Ah-si, the mission is extremely dangerous. I just want the master to be safe. All right, then. Master... I must ask a favor? I'm in love with the photographer's daughter. When this is all over, will you help me propose? Yes. Of course! Long live Boss! Long live Boss! Ah-si! Turn around. Where to? To see the photographer. Got it! Sir, may I help you? I'm here to discuss a marriage proposal. Come, Ah-si. Ah-si has been with us at Jin Li Yuan for over 10 years. He's thoughtful, honest and caring. Please accept this money. More will come later. Please don't joke with me. Hey, man... I promise you, once your daughter joins our family at Jin Li Yuan, I will treat her like my own. Let's discuss this inside. My daughter would be honored to be part of Master Li's household. A-chun, bring some tea for Master Li! Master Li, let's discuss the wedding arrangements and the dowry and where to host the wedding. When shall we set the wedding day? Master Li, what do you think? Master Li? - Let's take a family portrait together. - Yes, of course! One, two, three! Father. Father. Where is he? Stop playing. Son, it's not safe outside. Promise to stay home for the next few days. Please? Let's eat! Professor, not eating, drinking or talking is bad for your health. As your former student, I'm concerned. I've brought the Professor his favorite wine, Shanxi's Fan Jiu! Is this my last meal? Of course not! You're my mentor! I've been taught to respect my mentors. You're like a father to me. If you still consider me your mentor, set me free! So that you can thwart my plans? Yan Xiao-Guo, do you remember the advice I gave you at your graduation? "Talented. But foolish. Will probably never achieve greatness!" Professor, you've misjudged me. Do you think that I blindly serve the imperial court? It's not true. I have a question, Professor. Other than war and suffering, disgrace and humiliation, what have the foreigners brought us? The belief that we are all born equal! In China, some can be born emperors and into privilege, while others are born into slavery! The Emperor has the Mandate of Heaven! That needs to change! We need to establish a democratic republic! Xiao-Guo, you received a western education. How could you remain blind to the world outside? The world is much bigger than you imagine! My western education taught me to see how evil and greedy the foreigners really are! Do you think you can save China with meetings and protests? Professor, you're just a teacher, you'll never achieve greatness. You still can't stomach the sight of blood, can you? You're all the same, useless and weak! If your revolution succeeds, China is doomed! I won't kill you, but I don't ever want to see you again! YUAN LI JIN I need 100 silver coins to bury my father and his men. - Bring her the money. - Yes, sir. I'm hungry. - More rice. - Yes, sir. I want to see your friend. My father died because of him. He disappeared at the same time your father was killed. He went to ask your father for help. I will take my father's place. At 9:00 a.m. tomorrow, Dr. Sun will arrive on shore. There will be a crowd of a thousand at the Star Ferry Pier. The assassins can easily blend into the crowd of coolies, merchants, foreigners and civilians. We must be on the alert! The large police presence at the pier will be our best defense. The assassins won't dare make a move there. Master! They're my brothers, they all run fast! We need someone to keep watch from the roof and signal us. I'll do it Dr. Sun will make three stops tomorrow. Yashuhito Society, Mrs. Sun's residence, the China Daily. - Be extra vigilant there! - Understood! From Queen's Road to Yashuhito Society, Fang Hong will lead the procession. Wang Fu-ming will bring up the rear. Remember, do not break formation! Tan Jiu warned me yesterday, three vacant properties along Queen's Road were leased on the same day. We don't know who rented them. We must get through these areas quickly. Do not stop! This morning, Sir Mathew expressed his concerns regarding the arrival of a certain distinguished Chinese gentleman tomorrow. Matters beyond Queen's Road are of no concern to us. Keep one eye open, close the other. Yes, sir. Reporting for duty, sir! At your service, sir! 1 DAY BEFORE SUN'S ARRIVAL Thank you all. It's for you! AFTER TOMORROW, I WILL MARRY YOU, AH-SI Ah-si, do you know who you're protecting tomorrow? I just want the master to be happy. This book was written by him. It's Young Master's favorite! Read it to me, please? All right. "I gave up medicine in order to help overthrow the Qing Empire and free my fellow countrymen. When I left Hong Kong I endured great hardship on the road. My mother was worried. She said, 'The revolution will save lives, but practicing medicine also saves lives. Why choose the harder path?'" I said, "Mother, there's much you don't understand. Practicing medicine can save a few lives, but the revolution can save millions." After 260 years of foreign rule, and 2,000 years of autocratic rulers, China is in decline. The Manchurian regime is corrupt and oppressive. It will only bring further suffering. The tide of revolution is rising. The will of the people shall prevail. We need to gather our courage to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and establish a true democratic nation! The road to revolution is paved with blood. My life is destined to end in time. But the republic will herald a new era of lasting peace and prosperity. We must continue to struggle and overcome obstacles in order to end the suffering of millions and allow the exiled millions to return to their homeland. After I was kicked out of Shaolin, I headed south and ended up in Putian. I kept going south until I reached Hong Kong. If I went any further, I would have fallen into the sea! Try the tofu. Stinky Tofu! These are for you! Not one pot that's green! Stinky Tofu! It's for you! Thank you! You're a Shaolin monk? Grab a chair... Will you show us your kung-fu tomorrow? I've never actually been in a real fight before. I'm not sure if my kung-fu works. But after tomorrow's mission, I will proudly return to Shaolin! You can't leave! I'm getting married soon! Really? - You must come to my wedding! - I will! Miss Fang, you're invited too! After tomorrow, I'm taking my father's ashes home. We will never leave home again. Dinner's ready! Time for dinner! It smells good! Let's eat! Master. Master, Chief Inspector Shi sent this over. Master Liu? I haven't been called Master Liu in a long time. My father told me on his deathbed, "The most important thing in life is... integrity." But tomorrow... I'll fail! I will be a liar! Do you know what is the most painful thing in life? To watch the one you love die. To fall in love with the wrong woman. I drove my father to his death. She killed herself in front of me. I'm tortured by that knowledge every day. I'm like a ghost. Nothing could be more painful. All for a woman, was it worth it? Tomorrow, will it be worth it? Thank you, Master Li. Tomorrow, Liu Yubai will be set free! What... What are you doing here? I need your help. What can I possibly do for Mrs. Li? You must help me! All right! I'll help you for old time's sake! But you have to pay. I need you to protect someone tomorrow. I'll pay any price to keep him safe! I'll do anything for money! Who is it? Li Yue-Tang! What? You want me to protect your new man? Sum Chung-Yang! Get out of my house! Can't you do something worthwhile for once? - Get out! - You must help him! Get out! He's raising you daughter! You know that? I was with you for eight years and you gambled the entire time. But I stuck with you! I never asked for anything! I stayed and accepted my fate because I loved you. But when I became pregnant, I didn't want my child to suffer the same fate. I needed a man who could be a good father. A man who could raise a child. Come over here! Look, your daughter is down there! When she grows up, what do you want me to tell her about her real father? If you come tomorrow, when she grows up, I'll tell her that... her father's name is Sum Chung-Yang! Stop! Go. Free Car Where's the gun? You were told to steal a gun from the police station! Look! It's money! Take it all! Loser. Master, you're back. Master... Mr. Chen? There's a change of plans for tomorrow. We need a decoy to ensure the safety of Dr. Sun. You want to use our people as bait? We're dealing with an invisible army! It's the way to keep Dr. Sun safe! No, that's out of the question! Dr. Sun hasn't been home in ages! But he's sacrificing his one chance to see his ailing mother! Revolution is not about spending money, printing newspapers and distributing pamphlets. Li Yue-Tang! Revolution is about blood and sacrifice! Since joining the cause, I've faced death many times! I can still die at any moment! Revolution is about sacrificing our generation - for your son's generations! - Enough! I'm just a businessman. We're drawing straws to determine who will pose as Dr. Sun on the last leg of the journey tomorrow. We must stall for one hour, no matter what. We need to give Dr. Sun time to meet and organize with the 13 delegates. The fate of 400 million countrymen will be decided in that one hour. Who drew the short straw? Who? No! It can't be! You shouldn't even be here! Draw again! Why? Because I'm the son of Li Yue-Tang? You don't understand! I promised your father that you wouldn't get involved! Uncle Chen, this is a historical turning point. The entire nation is involved! How can I be the exception? But you're his only son! Only son? Isn't this the type of feudal thinking the revolution hopes to change? Aren't we striving to establish an equal society? I can't sacrifice my life, but they can? You want them to draw straws again because I'm the son of Li Yue-Tang. How can you justify it to them? Chung-Guang, I... I just can't let this happen. General, we've got the gun. - Are you clear about the mission? - Yes, sir. Thank you. Tomorrow, we'll use this foreigner's invention to kill that traitor Sun. Xiao-bai, thank you. Mr. Sun! Mr. Sun! Don't stop! Run! Use the covered walkway! Grab the sacks of rice! Tell Ah-si to get the rickshaw! Ah-si has left. He said Master wasn't going out today! Who fiddled with my watch? Charge straight ahead! Go! Go! Hurry! Go! Stinky Tofu! Go! Stinky Tofu! My name is Wang Fu-ming! Go! WANG FU-MING BORN IN ZHENGZHOU, HENAN, 1878 DECEASED 1906 Ah-si! Young Master? Go away! - You shouldn't be here! - Come here! - I won't let you do this. - What are you saying? You can't do this. Do you know how important this day is? Do you know how much preparation it took and how many lives were sacrificed?! I don't care. Ah-si, the future of our country is at stake! I don't care! I can't let Young Master do this! It's now 9:59. We'll depart at 10:00. And then Dr. Sun can leave safely. Young Master... It's now 9:59 and 30 seconds. Ah-si, will you stay with me for the final hour? Fifteen seconds to go. It seems I've waited 17 years for this hour! Young Master, don't do this, I beg you! Fifty-five, 56, 57, 58, 59! Ah-si, let's go! Go! Young Master... Ah-si, you told me once that every night when you close your eyes in bed, you see A-chun. When I close my eyes, I see China's future! FUREN CLUB They're coming! Stay away! Father, forgive me! Yue-Tang! FANG HONG BORN IN JINGHAI, TIENTSIN, 1890 DECEASED 1906 You, out in front, don't move! Step out, all of you! Stay put! We were only passing through. - Don't move! Were you involved? - It has nothing to do with us! - We were heading that way... - Nobody moves! You two may go! But this is a serious matter! We can't leave. - You're relieved of duty! - Wait for orders. Where did you find this man? He's sabotaging our mission! Get him! You idiot! Are you trying to start a rebellion here? This is Hong Kong. A colony of the Great British Empire! Round them up! Li Yue-Tang. You practically own Hong Kong. But you've never had a police escort, have you? Here's your chance Move! Li Yue-Tang! Move! Let's go! Yue-Tang, in five minutes, there will be no police in the streets of Hong Kong. Our superiors have ordered all of us to retreat. He said that China's affairs are to be resolved by the Chinese. I'll take you as far as I can on the last part of your journey! Go! The beggar's here! Run! Get up there! Hurry! We'll go upstairs to meet with Mrs. Sun! We must stall for another 15 minutes! How old are you? Seventeen. How are your parents? My father is nearly 60. My mother is dead. I must thank you on behalf of my son. I must also thank your father. Farewell! Let's go! Use the tunnel! LIU YUBAI BORN IN YANGZHOU, JIANGSU, 1871 DECEASED 1906 Use it when necessary. Get in! Chung-Guang! Go! Go! Take this to Nianci. Take it! Go! Just go! SUM CHUNG-YANG PLACE AND DATE OF BIRTH UNKNOWN DECEASED 1906 Our main targets are Guangdong, Guangxi and Yunnan. We'll start rebellions in Chaozhou and Huizhou at the same time. Meanwhile, Guangdong and Guangxi will join in to thin out their forces... Go back! Bao-shi, take my place! Go back! Chung-Guang! Go! Sit tight! Let go! Let go! You asked for it. DENG SI-DI BORN IN XIANGSHAN, GUANGDONG, 1884 DECEASED 1906 PURE Ten years ago, Qu-yun and I discussed "the revolution." I said, revolution will bring prosperity to 400 million countrymen and put an end to hunger and poverty. Ten years have passed. I saw many comrades sacrifice their lives. My exile ended. Here I am again. "Revolution" no longer has the same meaning for me. Today if you asked me, "What is revolution?" I would say, "A nation cannot progress without sacrifice. The road to modernization is paved with blood. And that blood is called revolution." Sun is indebted. By imperial decree, execute Sun the traitor! Yan Xiao-Guo... Don't do it! It's all over! Sun Wen is gone! Death to the traitor! Long live the empire! Sun Wen has already left! Death to the traitor! Long live the empire! Chung-Guang! Run! No! Chung-Guang! He's not Sun Wen! Yan Xiao-Guo! He's not Sun Wen! He's not Sun Wen! No! Chung-Guang! Yan Xiao-Guo! Your student has fulfilled his duty to his country! I told you, stay home for a few days. Why didn't you listen?
