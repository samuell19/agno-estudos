That was it. What is it, sweetie? What's up, Myrto? What's up? Where's your pacifier? Where's your pacifier? We have to feed her. See what you can do. Where to? - I don't know. To the treatment hall where there are beds. Doctor, we're here. Take a long breath and hold still. Breathe. Breathe. He doesn't seem stoned. He looks shocked. - Whose baby is it? I don't know. - So what? Whose baby is it? Yours? Chryssa's, and mine. It's Chryssa's. Are you the father? - No, I'm not. Yes. Let's go. Let's go. Good morning. I'm a social worker. From welfare. I came for the child. What child? Chryssa's child. She was with her. We... We'd given up on her. Where's the child's father? I don't know. I don't know him... What... what do you want from me? Me... I don't... What can I do? Is anyone else here? I'll come by later for some paperwork. Myrto. Myrto is her name. Her diapers are on the back seat. We were looking for you, Mr Agaliotis. I was here. I was here. A soldier. What's your relationship with the girl? An affair. Where's Myrto now? Is she alright? - Yes. Does Michalis have her? - We've taken care of her. You were driving, right? Where were you going? I don't know. Away. I was in the army. I got discharged, I'm a civilian now. I wanted to make something of my life. A family, kids... Back then, I wanted to save all the kids. That's all I know. Mina! Rastin! Come home, lunch is ready. Hello. Got the money? Right, everything's been arranged. You'll be picked up within two weeks and taken across the border. Where will we go? Across the river and towards the sea. Then it's easy: Europe. How old are the kids? Ten and twelve, why? Not good. The children will cross with a different crew. We have a guy to do that. No way. It's not my decision. But don't worry. Their backpacks will have milk and chocolate, everything they need. I don't want to leave my kids. - Hello. Done. - I can't. A couple and two kids. I know, but we must. Iraqi Kurds. Zelgai. Get the boxes. Don't be afraid of the dead. Their souls help us. There are many souls where we're going, you know? Sometimes in the sky among the stars... and sometimes inside of us. Found it! Don't be afraid, okay? - Okay. Trust yourself. You'll find your way. Let's go. Good evening. - Good evening! I didn't hear you. Are your stomachs empty? Good evening! Good evening! Now we're talking. It's hot today. Keep your flasks full of cold water. Take care of yourselves. Are you alright? - Carry out your duties as normal. The patrols. The watchtowers. Keep to the schedule. Battalion! Attention! At ease! Dismissed. Sergeant, take care of the private. You and you, come with me. Let's go. Nice and slow. Put him here, gently. Go to the medicine cabinet. Up on the right... Don't be scared. Don't be scared. You'll be fine. Are you okay? - Yeah. They'll bring you back in a body bag, fool. Nobody will miss me. - Move, let me get some sugar. What for, the eggs? - Yeah, it'll be nice. You'll poison us, man. You have no clue. Volunteer for the mines, eh? They're looking for suckers. It's quiet there. - Like in a graveyard. But the sky's big. - That makes people think you're weird. I'll miss your sugared eggs. Get lost, clown. Apostolou, open the door. Come on. Me again? Motherfucker... What do you want? Agaliotis, Yannis. I'm a volunteer like you. Hi, friend. I'm Nikolas. Apostolou. Go make some coffee. Why me, man? Send the rookie. Stop moaning. He's asleep already. Dreaming, too. We're quitting for today, guys. Let's go, let's go. Come on, Agaliotis. Let's go. There used to be a factory here. It exploded. That's why it beeps. Metal everywhere. From long ago, before you were born. Afterwards, they scattered the mines here. Who knows why? It'll take more than ten years to clear it. - That's what I mean. The maps are rubbish here. We've got lots to do today. I've got the hammer. Alone. Get down! Everybody down! Down! Are you mad? What are you doing? - Down! Agaliotis! Wait for me there. Don't be afraid, love. Don't be afraid. Let's go. Where were you at this time of night? - By the river. The moon is full. At the camp, they say you talk with spirits. At the camp, they also say three shaved chicks are waiting for them on the outside. Goodnight, Yannis. It's strange out there at this time. What? The wind... It gives birth to voices. Let's go, guys. Be ready in two minutes. Get dressed, Apostolou. Let's go, guys. God damn, so early in the morning. What happened, Gikas? What happened? They fell in, that's what. Lost, illegal immigrants. What's up with you? What are you scared of? Let's go! Come on, Sergeant. Now, now! Yannis. Wanna go out? I have no money. Come on, I have enough for a beer. And before you were drafted? Ambassador. Which country? They're all the same. Delivery guy. Buy three, get one free. And before that? I worked nights. Jail duty. - What's that about? Bar owners hire a guard to look after the chairs at night. During open hours, I went from one bar to the other. If any crime was committed, I was the scapegoat. Guilty by profession. Just like the minefield: No matter who steps on the iron... you get blown up. Can you see them? - Shall I shoot? No. Let's see what's going on. Mina! Mina. What's your name? - Esma. See anything? The bloody idiots drowned. Shall we call it in? The river took the girl. - And her backpack? Couldn't get it. - We took a hit tonight. Terrible night. - Don't stay here. At the delta tomorrow. Little bastard. Fuck. He's gone. - Heads are gonna roll. I lost my shoe. Get going. Did you get it? The money? Shut up. I'll take it when it's time. Okay. You know better. I've lost my shoe, damn. I've lost my shoe. Why aren't you sleeping? The baby's asleep in there. And why aren't you asleep? - I'm scared. Of what? I'm here, don't be scared. Wait for me down the road. - Okay. Welcome, fairy of the shore. - Don't come any closer. Stop. My money. My money, my money. 'My money, my money'. That's all you ever say. Her money. We had a problem yesterday. Did you find the boy? - Neither the boy nor his backpack. A difficult situation, get it? The people above me won't let this pass. For a year, you've had no problem with me. Right? The area flooded and people drowned. Don't pay the river, pay me. My money, my money. When will you take the baby and come with me to Istanbul? When you stop pimping, get a villa on the Bosporus... and send our daughter to the best colleges. Your words. Remember? Stay away. You'll be back. Agaliotis. Go away, it's my job now. Go. Hey, Agaliotis. Don't rush into it like that, man. You'll lose your head one day. Cadet. Give him a cigarette. Let's take a break. Who has brought food? - I have some in my bag. Can I ask you something? What happened to you the other day? Were you scared the kids would fall in? I'm scared when they're scared. I grew up in an institution, you know. Last call, boys, I'm closing. This is the mouth of hell. Fifteen years in the mines, and this is the worst part. Maps are rubbish. The machine beeps all the time. Same old shit. Don't perform magic here. This place reeks of death, got it? Let's go. Metal everywhere. The detector is beeping all the time. Here, you don't need a pyro-technician, you need a psychic. I requested a transfer, but... it was rejected. - Thank God. How could we live without you? Nikola, are you alright? I'm fine. They saw us, got scared and ran. Nothing left of them. Right where we'd cleared up. Right in front of our eyes. They were kids. Oh, no. Not again. Agaliotis! Agaliotis! Sergeant, come here. Cadet, call for backup quickly... Too much death, all around. I'll clear them all, I swear. You'll take your kids for a walk there. We'll discharge him early. - No, sir. He's unpredictable. He might blow us all up. What was he thinking, emptying magazines everywhere? Our job is difficult, Commander. I need him. You can't control him. We'll keep an eye on him. Besides... he has nowhere to go. Our platoon is his home. Yannis, where are you going? Had enough in there? Who was she? - Who? Sometimes they bring supplies. Why? Beautiful, huh? Obviously. Do you have anything to eat? - Eggs with sugar, your favourite. Tinned food at the outpost would be nicer. - I'll bring you spinach pie. No need, I took this. Good morning! - Good morning! Are the baths open? - For now, yes. Is there a room? I'll set you up here in the little room at the front. Good morning. Apples. A kilo? It's hell out there, watch your step. One euro twenty. One euro. A present for our little friend. I'll make you a corridor. What do you want? I'll make you a corridor to pass with the kids. I have more serious things on my mind. Like what? A baby sleeping in the truck. And your husband? There isn't one. Let's pack up soon. It's still early. Go and I'll call you. Anything else? - What's your name? Go, don't wait for me. Levo! Levo! He was hiding back there, admiring the view. Should I shoot? Not here. Take him to the river. Wait, he's with me. He helps me cross the river with the children. I need him. I'll do the next crossing. Okay? Whenever you want. What are you man? A cop? A soldier? A soldier. What'll you do, bring the border guards? Know how many will take his place? They're countless. Know how many are crossing? Nothing stops them. Why do you do this? I have mouths to feed. Can't you do that selling apples? You're funny, know that? They were going to waste you just now, get it? I said if you bring soldiers, they can kill me. There are winds... that make warped trees straight. Have you changed her, did she eat? Did you warm up the milk or give it to her cold? Done your homework? Where is it? - What? Here you go. Why are you sitting here? I have to go to work. What's your name? You asked me that before. Eftichia. (Joy) 'Joy', that's not your name. You know it all, right? You smell self-assured. - No. I'm lost myself. And what do you want from me? I've been looking for you. I was looking and waiting for you. Come on. Let's go inside, I'll show you a beauty. You're the first stranger to come in here. Look at her. Warm, rosy apple. They're looking for you... Levo. More backpacks were lost, he says. You don't know where we are. - Fine, they'll beat the shit out of me. Areti, I've brought my wife and child. You have the key. Do you need anything for the child? - No, we'll stay awhile. You're on the run. He's not your husband. How do you know? - By the way you look at each other. Still hungry for one another. Make her his own. No one else will look at you like that. Let's drink some coffee. What if something happens to me? The girl, she's gone. It's my fault. I want to be with you. Forever. Chryssa is my name. Chryssa. What'll you do if I send you away? Will you leave? I have nowhere to go. I have nobody. And I'm still a soldier. And they let you wander around? I took leave. In a few days, I'll be discharged. I have money for a bit. And then what? We'll see. How will you cope? What do you have? I have myself at the mines. I'm considering five years in the military. I want to change our lives. I have the baby. No more mines, passages, and... Better sell apples. If you want to be with us, it's the only way. Come here. Come on. Let us go. It's not up to me. You know the children's backpacks didn't have any sweets in them. When will I stop being death's boatman? I have your daughter to bring up by myself. What do you have to offer her apart from big words? Nothing. All you can do is take. You can take our lives if you want, nothing more. What do you want? Me to die for you? You have a guardian angel inside. She's asleep now. I'll be back to take what you owe me. Okay, I'll find them. A girl died. The older one. They got rid of her. What do you mean? It's my fault? Did I kill her? It was her fate to drown, man. Is this child's play? He's done for, right? - It won't be easy to waste him. Do you know how much this cost us? Listen, Murat. Ask Cem. This isn't child's play. People die in this business. Money doesn't grow on trees. That older girl... They got rid of her. It's me. Finish Levo off. You'll have to make a little investigation. Find a pen and paper. A Fiat Tempra: RME... 1978. RME, 1978. Come on, hide the stuff there. Welcome, sir. Your room is ready. Man, woman and child. Don't touch them. Hear me? Hear me? You came. And you're... going again. I'll be back. Look after our Kyriakos. Be a good citizen, Agaliotis. - See you. Do we have everything? - Yeah. I'll call Areti. Did you say goodbye? No, should we go back? I'm afraid they're on our tail. We have to lose them. That was it. Off we go. What is it, sweetie? What's up, Myrto? What's up? Where's your pacifier? Where's your pacifier? Chryssa, Chryssa. No. no. no... Yannis. Quit the fairy tales. You're going down for dealing big quantities. Give us a name so we can do our job. What name? If the packages in the back weren't yours, whose were they? What, what... What packages? I don't know... Yannis, don't piss me off, you think we're playing? Give us something. - 800 years hard labour for you! Don't cover up for anyone, friend. Someone ratted on you. We knew for long you were loaded. We'd set up a roadblock to stop you. Your people ratted on you. Get it? No, I don't understand. Cut the shit. You knew nothing about it? Who loaded the coke, Where did he get it and where was it going? Want some water? Mr Karayorgos, you're the next of kin. You'll have to sign this. Here. You didn't drink your coffee. Here. Katerina? Don't get too attached, we're letting her go soon. Tomorrow she'll be in the institution. I'll take care of her. Give me a sign even if you knew about it... Please, please, please. Give me a sign... Give me a sign. Even if you knew about it. What's up? I want to speak with the commissioner. Sir, the detainee has something to tell you. I was looking for... I was looking for the pacifier. Yannis, we've been through this. Nobody ever went in so deep. So I went there. To do something special with my shitty life. It was... hell at the minefield. I fell right into it. I had a gift, I did good work. The longer it took us, the more... children were... There was nothing left of them. I can't know where all those people were going or what has to happen... but Mr Commissioner... Every time we dug out a mine, we got courage. Every three, get one free. Alive, you know? What's the girl got to do with it? She helped them cross the river at night. Is that all? That's all. I loved her so much. Jonas, Marlene. Marlene, Jonas. They're here. - Show them in. Katerina, we're waiting for you. They're waiting. Why are you taking this road? We're picking up your papers at the outpost... then to the prosecutor's. Freeze! The bastard tricked us. Where's he going, Sergeant? I'm afraid he knows. We'll gather him up in pieces. He seemed like a lamb. - A lamb... to the slaughter. We have an escaped prisoner near the minefield. Who was his best friend at the outpost? Bring him. Yes, sir. What's he doing? Don't take any risks. Talk to him from a safe distance. Tell him we all believe he's innocent. It's true. We'll talk with this. Go. Let's go, brother. Chryssa's waiting. I'm waiting for her sign. It's not your time yet. Tell everyone to get away from the wire. I don't want anyone. I want silence. Tell them to leave. He wants everyone to go. He wants silence. Come on boy, have something to eat. Nikolas. Don't stay here. I'm going to leave now. You'll be found innocent, the commander said so. They know. Don't talk, listen. What? Listen. People. Crossing the river. Who brought them this way? No, no! No, go back! Back, back! Mines! Go back! No, no, stop! Go now, go. Go, we'll be torn to pieces. You're here now? - Yeah. I'll come and see you. Subtitling by SUBS Hamburg Matthew Way
