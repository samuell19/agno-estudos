Don't be excited This cannon is useless. Look! It can't even blast through this thin plate. how could it destroy the robot? This is my genuine invention: The electro-sonic cannon My original design is to trigger the shell by supersonic shock so the velocity of the shell is faster than ordinary cannons So what? Accelerated velocity increases the destruction capability O.K. O.K. Go on with you work I'll continue my research here Chief Don't hesitate to ask when you don't understand Chief.
