HERE WE ARE! BASED ON THE MONOLOG "HOLIDAYMAKERS" BY JUHAN SMUUL There's an old well and a creaky garden gate. There's an old gate, an old creaky garden gate... The night is setting in and I'm still looking to the sea. And a little house is waiting for me on the seacoast. Oh, it's so good to know that the sea and the sands and a small house are still waiting for me somewhere. Liina! Are you going to be home tomorrow? Yes, I will. - You weren't once... - When? On Monday I went fishing with my dad. -AA - I'll pop in some day again. May I? - Yes, you may. I'm right here all the time! Tu tu tu! Cheers. - Hello! We are vacationers (tourists) and we would like to... how should I put it... to spend some days here. Is this your boy? - Look, take it. Wait, wait! To spend a few days here... Tell him that we are from Tallinn. Otherwise he wonders where we are coming from. My wife. She is a really, really good person. Tell him that we'll pay. Don't be such a dawdler! Tell him that we'll pay! We pay... No. I don't want such a rusty coffee-grinder who thinks that I can't understand her. We don't have room anyway, as we have a big family. Can't he understand? Tell him that we are Soviet people and that we will pay! Tell him we pay! Tell him that we are from Tallinn. What are you dawdling for?! Hello, are you a human being? Yeah, yeah, I'm asking you! I'm wondering if you're a human being? I have to think about it. I have to talk with my wife. Please, please. Yes, just a little bit... Hello, I can recognize a former officer right away. Are these your kids? Kids, go home quickly! You seem to be like a decent human being. I certainly am a human being, but you should be used for shooting rabbits. Do you like it here? - I like it, dear host, I like it. What are you dawdling for?! Tell him that we are Soviet people. Tell him that we will pay! How long has this woman been boiling you like this? The lid is about to fall off, huh? - Dear farmer... All right, All right. - Thank you! John, let the water out! The car, empty the water from our car, stupid. Unpack our things, what are you dawdlering?! The hostess will show us the room, yes? Please. Pantry. No, it is... Ah, animals in the living room! Wild, Spooky! Phew, scary! Oh, forgive me, I'm sorry! - We will take this room. - No, this is the children's room. - So what? Don't you forget, ma'am, that we are from Tallinn I hope that you're a human being too. Then move in. Although you are an uneducated woman, you are still human being. Aadu, you have dealt with many lunatics. - Well? Have you ever seen such peolple? Children! Children-children-children, who allowed you to drink cold water from the well? You are not allowed! Not allowed, not allowed. You have no nerves either. Yet cheeks are nice and red! Ma'am, why do they look so good? What do you think children should look like? - Behaved. Children must be behaved, behaved. Lasses are sweet in harbors, wine is sweet in harbors... Who taught you to sing such songs? Children don't sing songs like that. Children sing such songs:The port was locked and the key was hidden... Ah, run away, run away. Don't run so widly! Go, go now! Hello, host! Dear host, What else is great about Muhumaa? We have the most junipers here, we have the biggest boulders, And we have the most hard-working men here. May I rest here or not?? And, once in a while, we get a stupid person stopping by. Well, dove... And voila, done! Hiiuli-hiiuli-hoo. Hiiuli-hiiuli-hoo. Let's get together... Help me up, what are you stuttering? - It was the firmest rope. - That ha-! - What? No-no, not you. You are different. Your waist can be embraced twice with just one hand. But the other one, you have to eat a sandwich first, to be able to hug her. You are... beautiful weird and lively. Oh my god! Scary! What is this? Is this an eel? - Well, yes. Is this a smoked eel? - Please hold it. Go! Mis, huh? This is horrible! My nerves are torn to shreds. That was an horrible room. The sea murmurs, the sheep bleat, I did not sleep at all last night. What would Your Highness like us to do then? Shall we kill the sheep or send them to school? An educated person would build his shack further from the sea. What's the matter? They want to move into Liina's room. - No way! - Dear host! - John, take our things into our new room! - Does it men that...? - What are you stutter, fool. - Yes, yes-yes-yes. Oops! Forgive me, dove. I am so lonely, no flowers in my garden... Dear farmer, what is the best thing in this world? - Whitefish. - I love you as much as you love Whitefish. Did she kiss you or what? - Well. Love is such a beutiful thing! The most beautiful of all is the first love for which we once married. The first love is as beautiful as a blue flower in a bush. or say like a milk churn! But then the other one comes, you know, you start wriggling as if bitten by fleas, and it attcks you like a raging bull smashing the gates to bits. - Shut up, man! - What's the matter with you, fool? Are you nuts? Man! Please, stop hanging on the fence! What are you chewing? I will take a rod! - How dare you? - Stand still. Stand still, blighter! - How dare you?! - Be quiet! How did you become such a German boatswain? John, we are leaving right now! Help! Help! Help! Oh my God, there are cows! Look what bulls! Bulls, lots of bulls! John! John! John! What are you looking at? Now what are you looking at? All right, let's rest. Ah are you scared, yes? Let's see wich of us is a human being in here. How did you get here, my beautiful flower? You're a real human being! - Nah. But why are you so fat? It would be so nice to hold you when the music sounds... Wait, wait! Wait, I'm comming! Well, where are you running now in such panic? What's up? kuss-kuss! So what happened? Of all things in the world, I fear cows the most. She harnessed you like a horse without any tender words. She made soles for her shoes out of your personality. - Forgive me. - I reallly feel sorry for you. Not just because your wife constantly nags at you, but because you have to do women's work. You should use a bit of common sense now. - Late. Late, host. Sure it is, if you did not use your head when you still could. I am a very unhappy person. but I am a good person, an educated person, but, unfortunately, I am too sentimental... That is why I find it hard to fit in this enviroment. - Aha. There's too much Renaissance in my soul. - Aha, aha. I'm afraid I wasn't born under a lucky star, and that's why I'm deprived of so much... The life that I live certainly isn't worth me. And so my soul longs for something else. I should be married to someone important, and my husband should spoil me and call me his kitten. We should have fun in the Viruu restaurant time and again. And you all would be green with envy. I'd allow my husband to carry me on his hands. He'd be allowed to be my secure support. My joyful eyes would make him really happy. And he'd be allowed to proudly wheel my cart in supermarkets. Even though you are a bumpkin, a totally uneducated person, I dance with you as if you were my equal. - Yes? I'm usually surrounded by different people. - Yeah? - Me too. - Scientists, artists, doctors, singers... - Singers rarely visit us. Host, who is that man over there? - It's Aadu. Don't you know him? He's a native of Muhu Island. He spend a little time here in Muhumaa, but he spends most of his time in an asylum. - The man is crazy. Crazy. - This guy? The only person who is normal in here, in Kolka is this person. Everyone else, including my husband, know absolutely nothing. Thank you, nice to meet you. It was really great. Oh, that was tough! I would like to rest on soft pillows. I'd like to drift and drift... Where... where are you going? Are you going to elections? In order to show my inner beauty, I have to show my outer beauty. - Are you still a girl or not? - What? - I asked you. Are you a man's wife or not? I was. - Ahh. You missed the right one. Swans are flying. - To the south? No, they stay here. They are looking for nesting places. I don't understand why the hell we came to this dump? To die of darkness and boredom?! Some bumpkins are staggering around, keep worrying about something, taking care of these disgusting cows. But years keep going by. - It's so peaceful here. - It is always paceful by the sea. The sea won't tolerate such howling monkeys. Life is complicated. - Don't make it difficult to live your own life. A black cat crossed our path, but we don't care! That won't scare us, so stick to the steer. Will the old love rust? No, it will not! Will the old love rust? No, it will not! Will the old love rust? No, it will not! Will the old love rust? No, it will not! If you're asleep, say "yes." Yes. Young lady, wake up, young lady. Just listen to that. If you lose me, blame yourself. Don't worry, dear. They're looking for someone younger. - You know us. We are from the herring boat - Yes. And we have come from far away. Mart, well, Mart. - Timmu is here too - Timmu, too? Let us in for just a second. We won't touch you, not even a fingertip. We'll just look at your bright eyes and wavy hair. Oh my god, how well they know me! Human beings, after all! Sing something, young men! She said "yes". The old horse also wants fresh oats once in a while. Oh women, where are your eyes, why can't you see the guys? Why won't flames of love break out in your hearts? Oh women, where are your eyes, why can't you see the guys? Why won't flames of love break out in your hearts? Even a wolf has a bride, yet alone I spend my time. Even a wolf has a bride, yet alone I spend my time. Hey, we made a song about that fat vacantionist, that madam from the city. Do you want to hear it? A fat old lady once told John that storks bring babies through chimneys. A fat old lady once told John that storks bring babies through chimneys. And John answered to her: you must be cheating, as our apartment's got steam heating! And John answered to her: you must be cheating, as our apartment's got steam heating! Idiots! You are no human beings, but bumpkins! I'm a genuine lady! I'll put you fifteen days in prison if I only recognize your ugly faces! Oh, fear, fear, now all the doors and windows will break! John! John! Who are you? Oh, how well does the fresh hay smell in here! John, John! - What are you raging about? I'm a Soviet citizen! I'm from Tallinn and I'm paying! Shut up or I'll put juniper in your pants. - Help! What do you want? - To fight! Help, John! John! - Or maybe... make love with you? - Help... - He? - Mhmh, now it's "he". Help... Look, woman, I am not from Luki but I had to fight in Curland. And once my boat capsized with a load of herrings, The wave hit the inverter and Joosep and I were lost for three days. I thought that I've been through all the hells in this life, but you see, Satan has sent me one more hell to go through!! I'm taking care of 120 sheep here. My daughter attends... Well, how it was?...Ah, philosophy in Tartu. A daughter? Are you married? What do you think I had a baby with soh or? - Phew. Look, the government is decent now, but it requires so much from children. Just study-study-study...all thetime! How hot is it here... - It's cold. - Summer, you know. Where is my partner? Wait, don't turn away. Let me listen to your heart beat. Don't you crawl in my lap! It is yet too early. Now what? Are you rabid? Well, son! Oh, don't shake me! Come on, let's go out. I'm not going to fight here. Father! Father! Father, the boys are about to fight for me! You'll pay for my jacket! Collar and buttons included! - I won't pay! - You will pay! Taste some! Fresh beer. And let's make peace. What a madman! Liina! In front of your dad and mom and Timmu, which one do you choose, Timmu or me, clearly? Otherwise there will be great bloodshed. I'm still so young... I'm still thinking. Yes, she will let you burn a little more to make sure she gets you ripe enough! Hey, friend! Let's have a fight and let it all out! Ouch! Let go of me! Boy, stand up! What's the matter with you? Did your sister go to the river? - What? - What what? Did you get the bridle? - What? - Don't talk like that! Polite! - Now where did you go? What is your family name? - Tenmen. - Tenmen? The two of you would make one decent herd boy. There are enough girls behind the fence! Son, son, peace now. Peace, peace. - Well, take it and let's settle. - Mart, let's be mates again. When we go see girls, there's smell of burning everywhere. - Why? Well, the hearts of girls are burning. Then it's worth the hassle for this empty thing... ... for such a trifle? - Don't talk like that! - Ah, let's move on. - Yes, let's go. Come... Easy, son, easy-easy. Hush a bye, have no fear, little angels are near... That's how it is I ask. If there is anyone here who can answer my questions, I will ask. How long will the dear guests have to suffer this nonsense? I ask this you, host! You can always go to other quiet places. John, we're leaving. So where do you go in the middle of the night? - Hayloft. Host, may we go to the hayloft? Thank you. John, get our stuff in the haylof! Children miss their room. They are humans, after all. Help! Help! - What's wrong? - The Coffe-Grinder got stuck in the hole. Help! Can't you see that a person is in trouble? Holy heavens! Come rescue me! Help! Immediately, immediately, pigeon, immediately! Honey, where are your legs? Bumkins! Indeed, I can neither go forward nor go back! You see, this goose is gagging. Imagine, how is that possible: A half of the woman in the loft and the other half out in the whole wide world? How can that one half make such a noise? I can't hold on any more. Help! How about calling the fire department from Orissa? - She isn't burning! Don't pull, push! Honey, how are you feeling there? She's not a human any more. Her feet are off the ground. She's not an angel either, she doesn't have wings. - That's right. If I'd only get up there, I'd put my heel on her throat. Come on, bring the straps, tie around the belly and then pull. Right! Let's do it! John! - Yes? Look how she's wriggling! Hush, mommy! Well, let's pull. Oh, my. No, we can't use that, it'd squeeze her blood vessels. - That's right. - Janne! - Yes? - Bring me a bread shovel. - Yes. I'm thinking of pushing with a bread shovel. - Yes. Did you catch fish today? - I haven't had any time to go fishing... Well, get ready! You see, this is now the place through which we were taught obedience and life wisdom in childhood. One and two and, at once! Well, done with the nuisance! Come on, take some, too. You're such a hard worker. When the sea is gray as a seal and you're beset by grief, When the sea is gray as a seal and you're beset by grief, It is good to know that the sea and the sands and a small house are still waiting for me. It's such a comfort to know that the sea and the sands and a small house are still waiting for me. There's an old well and a creaky garden gate. There's an old gate, an old creaky garden gate... The night is setting in and I'm still looking to the sea. And a little house is waiting for me on the seacoast. It's such a comfort to know that the sea and the sands and a small house are still waiting for me.

It is good to know that the sea and the sands and a small house are still waiting for me. Liina! are you sleeping? - Yes. I'll lock your barn door, just in case. There are all kinds of people roaming about here. And the wolf said "ouch-ouch-ouch" You know, Liina, what I would want? I would like to be your good friend all the time, all my life . I'd like you to be more like a husband for me. Do you want to be my wife? - Yes. Se wants to! Se wants to! Se wants to! Se wants to! - What? - She won't get down. - What? - She doesn't want to come down. Wait, wait, wait. Who wants what here? - Father, I just get married. - Are you kidding? - To whom? - Timmu. - Just like that? - Just like that, yes. Why did you merry him so suddnely? He came here last night with that silver moon on his back... Can I ever understand woman's heart? She even adds the moon... Hey, what did you just say? I told you that she does not want to come down. - What? - That doesn't want to come down. There's a big hole above the cowshed. Let her use that. What shed? What hole? - What happened? - Liina got married. What? The guy with the silver moon. That's it. - Have you gone crazy? - Me? She went! - To whom? - To Timmu! Scary, scary! He's so pitiful and thin! But very beautiful! Other people cry secretly about their sorrows, but you cry here for the whole nation or to the entire collective, as they write in the newspapers. Shut up! Mother! It's okay, mom will forgive you, it's mothers' job, forgiving. Come here, girl. Sit down! You're taking away my last daughter, huh? Why are you silent for so long?! - Don't yell at the child! - After all, I'm still a little happy too. - Tell me about it! - What? All right. Be afarid of your husband and the husband's parents. Don't be afraid of one thing Don't be afraid of work. And remember: that a wife has to feed her husband and six children! Stop crying! Life has its own laws. What's that? John! What should I do? First we'll have to get that barrel down from the roof. I'll mess him up so much that they'll need his passport photo to patch him together! - It's too late, too late. - How late? - Already done. - Where did she go? - Where did she go? - To Timmu. Have you gone crazy? You're no sharper than a grindstone from Gotland! What are you raging about here?! Do you... Shame! You see, boy! - Aadu, listen. - What is? - I want to cry. - Cry, son. Crying is the best thing in the world. Every good man has to cry his fate once. Cry, cry-cry, son! - I'd like to have a decent cry in a soft pillow. - Cry-cry. - Well, start crying now! - But I don't have a pillow! - No pillow? Hey, Blaze, come here! Hold the boy's head in your lap for now, I'll go to get him a pillow. - Take care, hold on! - Hang on! I'm here, sweetheart! In Tallinn, we'll go to a cafe and to the Zoo. - Yes. - Wait! Come to me. Will you marry me, please! I'm so lonely, so lonely! Drink less and don't try to get all women all at once. Well, now she's chewing the rafters. We make a hole in the roof, maybe she will come out. Right, yes. No it isn't right! Why destroy a solid reed roof for such a fool? Don't touch the reed! I'll fetch a saw! Do not touch the cane! What a blast! - She is gone... - Let's not get hopes up! My deepest condolences. Wait! Will the old love rust? No, it will not! Will the old love rust? No, it will not! Host, do you have a pint of beer? I've always been a joker and a tippler. Women, women, why won't you find me? Money is not a problem, not a problem at all! I won't come down! Host, I've an idea about the hole. If there was a third hole. The third hole, you know, it is... What are you doing here, you better come help us! - Damn young man, I say... - Well? Something is dawning on him! There's no way you can get this hag down from the top. I'm not coming down! You can bury me with the house! Would it be worth it? It's very poisonous, isn't it? Help, there are snakes in here! Large African crocodiles! - John, I'll jump down! - No! I'm jumping down and I want to see if you're going to hire an orchestra for my grave or not. You are not allowed! You can't jump, dear! Don't jump! Hello, Honey! Hello, where are you, dear? I'll be right there, sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart. I am flying to you! - What is she doing now? - Sitting in the cowshed. - What is she doing there? - What is she doing there? Staring at a ram. Look, she's coming out all by herself! Be quiet! - She is all right after all. - She's okay! Legs are unbroken. You are an amazing jumper. A human being, after all... Here you are! Easy! Don't hit her, dear! Stop it! I'll show you! Now I know why young men lurk behind my window. They won't consider that red-haired bitch a human. Human beings, after all... Her hair is just a dyed ponytail! Everything else is also fake, only unpainted! The one with the short hair is my girl! Ah, an attack from behind! Do you want me to beat them all in the back of the head at the same time? Don't be a hooligan! Sweetheart, sweetheart... No! don't you dare! The heel is as sharp as a bradawl of pure steel. Honey, honey I beg you... - Got what she wanted. - It can't miss either. Did you get hit by a sawbuck, or? With that heel or something? Show me. Think, little feeling, As if severe north wind had plowed your face... Or, like they used to write in newspapers, as if tough life and fishing in winter had trenched the face. And you, goose, I'll write a song about you. If they put you in prison for beating and release you soon, but you'll remain in the song for at least hundred years. And no begging will get you out of the song. And a movie will be made of that song! A movie about me? They'll show you in television alive, for money. That's how it is. - In TV? Yeah-yeah. Look what you've done! The poor man's lip is split. What lip? Split how? Oh, my God! Save a woman's beauty with your face! A human, after all! I'd like to compensate for the trouble we caused... What is this? 10 rubles? We don't need anything! You brought me here to this madhouse! Shut up! Yes, you did! Instead of getting a hotel abroad for your wife you dragged me in this god-forsaken place! Madhouse! You see, I'm a lady. I'm a lady, do you understand? A human! Why didn't you block my way when I waved with the shoe? Madhouse, spooky! People? There is nothing here! There is no place to sleep! They do not understand the wishes of a gentle woman! Humans? They do not know what people are, and they will never be people. Close the suitcase and throw them 5 rubles. Let's go! Hurry up you fool, what are you stuttering. Do what you stutter quickly! It was so nice to spend the holiday at your place. Maybe you'll become a human being someday. However, Muhumaa has very beautiful nature. - We made a perfect match. - You reckon? It's a shame that young men get married so early. Don't push so hard! Nice people! Oh, what are you doing now? Whoops! Hey, you dark-headed girl! Come out! Imagine! He just lifted two ladies and the car! Hello, hooligan! Stop it! Let us down! Hooligan! Bye-Bye, uu! Come on, say a few kind words. Who do you think I am? The curate or the chairman of the village council or? Well, tell me, you have the gift of gab. Keep away! What advice could I offer you? Marry again. And when you tend to quarrel, live for the sake of the days of reconcilement Put both heaven and hell in one house at the same time. I guess you should be able to do that. Wait! - And should you have children... - Yes, we will! Well, you know that, don't you? ... then you sometimes could brought them to us. We have young grandchildren of our own, and they'd just love to play together. See! An islander, yet a human being! Will you ever be able to fix that stuff? What are you dawdling for, fool! Loser! More power to your arm! Oh, skillful hands! Do you need help? Need help? Maybe you'd like to meet me sometime in the future! Bye-Bye! Show it to me! Doctor Aadu Kadakas, Psychiatrist. Where are you going? - Maybe to Tallinn, but maybe to the Atlantic. Not going anywhere. Is there not enough work in the collective farm? Sit down! When we will have babies, we will name the first one Ärn after grandfather, to the second according to you Timmu, to the third... - What? How many children are you going to have? They will come! Or is there something wrong with you? Remember how I brought you home? Junipers were rushing by and the sleigh-bells tinkled... and I was drunk without wine, remember? I haven't hugged you in a long time! They are fighting! Father, Father! Sit! Sit! - Nonoh! Here we are! - What are you dawdling for, fool! - We are from Tallinn, we pay. What are you dawdling for, fool! What are you dawdling for, fool! What are you dawdling for, fool! What are you dawdling for, fool!
