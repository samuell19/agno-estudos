This one goes out to Jessie from David who says, "Let's make some memories this weekend!" [POP MUSIC PLAYING] -[JESSIE LAUGHING] -[DAVID GRUNTING] Oh David, look! An antique store! -It looks cute! Come on, let's go, please? -No, no. What about the reservations? We're running late already. -The weather's getting bad. -Are you serious? -Come on. -[SIGHS] Okay. You're right. Let's go antiquing. -Yay! I love you! -[CHUCKLES] [DOORBELL CHIMING] You know what? This place is awesome. I knew it would be worth it. Oh wow. This place is unbelievable. I've never seen anything like this. [PHONE CAMERA CLICKS] Oh, hello. You know where I'll be. Okay. -Have fun. -[PHONE CAMERA CLICKS] I need to take some shots for my blog anyways. -I'm behind. -Sure. -[PHONE CAMERA CLICKS] -I'll be here when you're done. [METAL SCRAPES] [FLOORBOARD CREAKING] [1940'S MUSIC CROONS OVER] [METAL SCRAPES] [FLOORBOARD CREAKING] [PHONE CAMERA CLICKS] -Oh God! -Hey-- Hey Jessie. It is you, isn't it? I'm sorry, who are you? Oh, I'm... just one of your fans. [JESSIE CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Wow. Your... Your skin is so beautiful. You're even prettier in person. -You're-- [GASPS] -Oh, please. -Don't touch me. -It's cool, it's cool. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I just... wanted to get a picture with you? For my blog? -Oh, um... -[SIGHS] [FLOORBOARD CREAKING] Please? [CHUCKLES] Yeah, sure. Cool, cool, cool, cool. Come here. -[PHONE CAMERA CLICKS] -[CHUCKLES] [FLOORBOARD CREAKING] Hey. How's it going? Good, good. There's some cool stuff in here. -Glad we stopped. -[CHUCKLES] Look at this. -It's sort of cute. [CHUCKLES] -[TOY GRUNTS] What is it? I don't know. Some 1920's creature. Can you believe someone thought this was like a great gift for a baby? [CHUCKLES] Well, it sure explains why my parents are so dysfunctional. -Hmm. -Oh! I think I'll take a pic with this and send it out to all my crazy fans. [PHONE CAMERA CLICKS] -[PHONE CAMERA CLICKS] -You know what? I hate it when you do that. I don't like having my face plastered all over the internet. Especially not with that thing. It's a toy, David. I mean, I'm posting it as a part of my vacation for my fans. Come on, after all, you are the love of my life. Yeah, well, I love you too, baby. But that thing is horrible! -Let's hit the road, huh? -Okay. [DAVID SIGHS] You okay? I'm sorry. Hm? I didn't mean to explode at you. I just... I just... I detest the whole social media thing. And I hate selfies. That's not it. It's something else. Well, what? There was this guy at the antique mall. He came up behind me and scared me. What the fuck? Said he recognized me, was a fan. Just wanted a photo with me, but he... touched me. God, you know I hate when strangers touch me. So, go on. Well, he took the photo and just vanished. I mean, he just disappeared. Really creeped me out. You see, Jessie? That's what I'm talking about. If you post your entire life on social media, I mean, [CHUCKLES] you have to expect that you're gonna get some creepy guys following you. Literally, doing God know what with your photo. Oh, Jessie! Oh, my God! -God, you're such a jerk! -Ow! I'm sorry. [CHUCKLES] You'll be okay. [RADIO SPUTTERING] Where's the entrance to this highway? It's gotta be around here somewhere. I can see, it's right there! -Goddamnit! This is not the highway! -[HORNS HONKING] What? We're going to be late for our reservation. You know how funny these B&B people can get. And you know what? I don't wanna get stuck in some cramped room. Can you call them? God! You know, you need to chill. -Yeah. -So what if we're late? -They charged my credit card in advance anyways. -Yeah. -You're right. -I know! David, my favorite! ["OUTLAW" BY SHANE PATRICK PLAYS OVER RADIO] Yeah, uh-huh. ♪ Your hands on the wheel ♪ ♪ Driving like it's stolen And ya don't know Where you're going ♪ ♪ But you know that you feel ♪ ♪ Like an outlaw ♪ -DAVID: It's a good song. -JESSIE: Oh, hell yeah! Oh! Got it! It's the tractor on the yellow road sign! How are you so good at this? Okay, my turn. Hmm... -I'm gonna make this tough. -Great. Okay. I spy something red. Well, it better not be a cop pulling us over. I'm driving way over the speed limit. -Oh, it's that barn over there? -Oh, you are so cold. Um... Is it your car? No, but you're getting warmer. -Here, I'll give you a hint. -Okay. Take a peek. Oh, my God. -[PHONE CAMERA CLICKING] -Babe, stop doing that. Don't be such a grouch. [CHUCKLES] -[WINDOW OPENING] -Jessie. -What are you doing? Would you stop doing that? -What? [PHONE CAMERA CLICKING] Oh, fuck! Shit! JESSIE: My phone! -Uh, we're gonna have to pull over. -Great. I don't fucking believe this. How the hell did this get here? Jessie! What are you doing? My phone! It's ruined! God, now what? [WHISPERS] Thank God. Wait, what is that? -Is that the thing from the antique mall? -Yeah. -Well, get it out of my tire! -I don't want to touch it! I'll just leave it stuck in there. I'll put on the spare. Oh, David? I got a flat a while back and I used the spare. -I guess I forgot about getting a new one. -Okay. Do you have roadside coverage? You can use my phone? No. But if you get this thing out of my tire, we can drive to a service station. Well, I don't know how far we can get with a flat tire. It's fine. Just get it out of my tire, all right? I hate this area. Oh, I'm taking it. What? I want to know how it got there! [DAVID SIGHS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] JESSIE: This place is a ghost town. DAVID: Jess, I'm afraid the axle is gonna break. Let's just park and find a place to stay. [DAVID CHUCKLES] Look at this building. It could be right out of France. JESSIE: You mean hotel. DAVID: Huh? This building that you're drooling over instead of me? -Yeah? -Yeah, it's a hotel. There's a sign. See? Well, let's get our overnights. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] It says use the back entrance. I guess this place is called Monroe Manor. Oh! Pretty and smart. Well, someone has to be the brains behind this outfit. Well then, Einstein, let's follow the arrows. I know you're pissed off but this could be fun, right? A little adventure, spontaneous, excitement. I'd rather be in Saratoga. [TRAP DOOR CLOSES] -Norman! -[DOOR CREAKING] -Norman are you home? -Okay, that's not funny. [DAVID LAUGHS] DAVID: Huh. -[BELL DINGS] -Jeez! Don't do that. God, this place gives me the creeps. Yeah, but I like the architecture in here. I'll have to ask about it and take some photos before the partners meeting next week. Yes, yes! This building is a gem. It was constructed in 1898 as the City Hall. But then the owner's family purchased it in 1982 and did renovations. But then... Plans changed. Things happened. But no worries! I am Salim. Welcome to Monroe Manor. Well, hi, Salim. I'm David Bradley, and this is Jessie. Now we're broken down out the front with a flat tire, no spare, so we need a place to stay. Flat and no spare. Hmm. [CLICKS TONGUE] Well, bad storm's blowing in tonight. Town is shutting up early. You're gonna have to deal with that tomorrow morning. Lucky for you, I do have a vacancy in one of our best suites. And our chef is serving dinner until 9 P.M. Place seems pretty dead. Oh, no, no, no, no. [CHUCKLES] There are other guests here, Jessie. It's just there have been so many cancellations due to the bad weather. And as you can see, we are short-staffed. But don't worry about any of that, all right? Tonight, you and David will have me at your service. So, all I need from you is, if you could just... ...sign the guest register. Don't you just swipe a card or something? Oh, no. We do things the old fashioned way here. I just need your name, an address and a phone number, and just a hundred dollars, cash only. -Just to cover the meal and drinks. -[DAVID SIGHS] Jeez, I don't even know if I have 200 cash. Baby, do you have any? -I know you were gonna do some shopping. -I guess so. No, I'm so sorry. I mean a hundred dollars for both of you. DAVID: Oh! Okay. DAVID: Ah. DAVID: Here you go. That seals the deal. Follow me. Let me show you to your room. Now, you best stick close to me because Monroe Manor has many twists and turns. It's easy to get lost around here. It does seem a little odd in here, but hey, I love the architecture! It's his job. He just made partner. Oh, congratulations! That's great news. And how about you, Miss Jessie? Let me guess. You're a model? Yeah. Hey, so that's a relic. Is it original? I see all the kids are wearing them these days? Oh yes, this was a present from Mr. Monroe himself. It keeps excellent time. -[ELEVATOR DINGS] -[ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS] Well... Our chariot awaits. [ELEVATOR DINGS] Here we are. I believe that you'll find your stay here most rewarding. -Oh really? -Mm-hmm. Aha! Here it is. Room 409. Our most romantic suite. [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] Wow. Oh yes. It has the most lovely view of the courthouse. Oh! Babe, look at this building. Jessie, it's a classic. SALIM: Oh, yes, yes, yes, everything here is vintage. Oh come on, babe. Look at the bright side. You love antiques. [CHUCKLES] I hope this place doesn't have black mold. Mm-hmm. JESSIE: Oh, let me have your phone. I better call Saratoga and let them know we'll be there by, what? 11 tomorrow? Yeah, good idea. [LINE RINGING] AUTOMATED VOICE: We're sorry, all circuits are busy now. All circuits are busy? What? I don't know, maybe the weather's bad? Looks like there's a storm brewing. Do feel free to stop by the lobby before you go to dinner. The restaurant can be rather difficult to find. Okay. Thanks, Salim. -[DAVID GRUNTS] -[BED CREAKING] JESSIE: Babe? Can you bring me my shampoo? I forgot it on the table. Found it! Um... It's locked. No, I left the door unlocked. What's going on? -Well, I don't know what to tell you, it's locked. -What's going on? David, what's going on? Seriously. Open the door! Babe, just hold on for a second. It might be jammed. David, open the fucking door! Ow! This better not be one of your tricks, -David Bradley. -No no! It wasn't me! You know I hate being locked in anywhere. The door was jammed, I told you. I got your shampoo. DAVID: Hmm? Oh. Oh. [DAVID CHUCKLES] DAVID: Oh. Hey, I've got an idea. How about I shampoo your hair? [SIGHS] -JESSIE: David? -Hm? -Could you zip me up? -Oh. With pleasure. -Come on. It's a mistake. -[DAVID MOANING] You smell so good. Hmm, you look stunning tonight. Just wait till tonight. [KNIFE CLATTERS] [FAUCET SQUEAKS] -Oh! Cheeky thing. -[CHUCKLES] -[BOTH CHUCKLE] -Oh. He's cute. This guy? Leroy Barnes? [CAMERA PHONE CLICKING] -DAVID: He's a lucky guy. -[CAMERA PHONE CLICKING] One with me. -[CAMERA PHONE CLICKING] -[DAVID EXCLAIMS] [DAVID LAUGHS] -You don't even have service. -Your camera works. I'll post it later. -I bet you will. -[ELEVATOR DINGS] [ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS] [MAN SIGHS, WINCES] Gotta get this chapter done. [GROANS EXHAUSTEDLY] Oh, I need coffee. [GROANS SOFTLY] [SIGHS IN EXASPERATION] [GROANS] Fresh coffee. [WINCES] Oh, I gotta get this chapter done tonight. [DAVID CHUCKLES] -Oh! -[JESSIE GASPS] [SALIM CHUCKLES SOFTLY] I've been expecting you. Come. We should get going. Chef Linda closes the kitchen promptly at 9 O'clock. Yeah. You mentioned that. I imagine this was once quite a uh, a grand City Hall, and I guess the Monroe family was very fortunate to obtain it. Oh, yes, yes. They're a very wealthy family. They did their best renovations here. Interesting. Oh, actually, that reminds me, today we had a bit of an incident in the bathroom. See, the door got jammed, and uh, well, Jessie got locked in. Oh. Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry. I'm... I'm so sorry. I will tell Mr. Monroe. Well, thank you. Yeah, Jessie normally never locks the door, so it was a little upsetting. If you know what I mean. No worries. Old doorways and locks, they tend to act out when it gets damp. Oh, it's okay, Salim. We worked it out. -DAVID: Hey Salim, wait up. -BOY: One. -DAVID: I have a question. -Two. Three, four, five, six. [CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLES] [SALIM'S WATCH BEEPS] Hot date, Salim? No. Not exactly. I just have to tend to another visitor. But please. Take a seat. -JESSIE: Thank you. -[CHAIR SQUEAKS] Well... Chef Linda will be down in just a moment. Thank you. -I think he... -[BOTH LAUGH] What's with the plastic watch? It's so annoying! I know. He's an odd one. Did I mention how beautiful you look tonight? [TYPEWRITER CLACKING] MAN: Good time. [CHAIR BEING DRAGGED] [CHAIR FALLS OVER] [NECK CRACKING] [BODY SWAYING] [TYPEWRITER CLICKING] So, this guy continues to tell me for, like, an hour about how Frank Lloyd Wright is the greatest of all time. I said, " How could you say that if you've never been to Barcelona to see Galvany?" Good evening, I'm Chef Linda. Tonight's menu is prime rib and baked potato, and pineapple upside down cake for dessert. Oh, um. No, I'm a vegetarian. David! She just ignored me. I mean, I have barely eaten anything today. I mean, I'm sure she heard you. It's okay. You won't starve. Are you saying I'm fat? You know I have to look good for my blog. No, I'm just saying that I'm sure she heard you and that she'll bring you some food. So relax, and enjoy this lovely room. [DISTANT THUNDER] Mmm, baby. It looks like you have another admirer. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] God, David, don't be gross. Well, that's what you get when you put yourself on social media. Well, you have a better suggestions? Yeah, I could think of a few things. Yeah, I'd share wine-- -Compliments of the house. -Ahh! Thank you! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [WATCH BEEPING] [CLEARS THROAT] Enjoy. With my deepest apologies for being understaffed this evening, and for that mishap with the bathroom door. Eugene Monroe. Welcome to Monroe Manor. Yeah, thanks. We love this place.

All the loops are off. Yummy time. I am sorry for the delay. Chef Linda, she always closes the kitchen promptly at 9 p.m. Oh, where is the chef? I want to thank her for my baked potato. DAVID: Jess! I'm sorry. -It has been such great service. -DAVID: I know, right? You know what? Fuck it, I'm not counting calories tonight. Perhaps I can interest you in some port. Would you be interested in some port? We have some 1980s vintage port from Portugal. Oh! More vintage. Thank-- thank-- thank you, Salim. This is... This is delicious. Thank you. Have a good night. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] Cheers. Jess, come on. We'll have more fun tomorrow, hmm? How about we, uh, take some photos, eh? -Show you fans how much fun you're having? -[PHONE CAMERA CLICKS] The only good thing about this place is the booze. You know what? This tastes pretty good. Try some. Come on. -Hmm. -Mmm. Delicious. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Oh. Vintage lights too? -JESS: How charming. -Now what? No power? Oh, come one, David. It's romantic. Did you plan this all for a reason? Huh? No. No. This sucks. He must not have stayed for dessert. What? Who? The cowboy and his pony. God, you're so disgusting. Hey, I'm sorry I dragged you here. I mean... you deserve better than this. David, I know I'm being a bitch, but I just... you know what look, I'm sorry. I know you're trying to make the best of the situation. That's my girl.

Yes, well, we've lived here... since my wife passed away. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] I'm so sorry. DAVID: Too much port, huh? No, no. I saw them. I saw them. DAVID: I think she just needs some sleep.

Well, I thought that if we were using the owners to help get my children's souls back, then we could-- Give me the cash. We've got bigger problems. Look. SALIM: What? How is this possible? Wait.

What the fuck is your problem? Eugene? Good. He's not dead yet. David, if you ever want to see Jessie again, I suggest you drag yourself over here. What is this? What's going on? This is my private space. You think Betancourt could keep Emma controlled with just drugs? He had help... From me. Where's Jessie? I need to see her. Keep the gun on him, Salim. He's a strong one. -Jessie... -Shut up! This will be over soon enough. [GRUNTING] Move! Move! All right! [MUFFLED SCREAMS] What are you doing down here? -It smells like death. -None of your business. Now, tie him up. [MUFFLED] No! No! He's bleeding! Will you shut up? Don't you understand you're making things worse for yourself? That the demon inside of Emma gets stronger with anger. It will kill you in a heartbeat and suck out your soul. [COUGHING] Ah, fuck! Hey. Jessie! Fuck man. It's gonna be okay. I-- I got it under control. Ow! Okay. [SNIFFS] Oh poor Betancourt. I'm gonna miss these excellent powders. What is your problem, princess? Don't you want eternal life? It's simple. See, I give you to the beast. And he gives me back my precious sister. Now we get out of this hotel and you get to stay... Forever! [MUFFLED SCREAMS] [LAUGHS] It's not that bad! It's really not. It's really not that bad! [DISTANT HUMMING] What about my children? What about Rohan and Dev? I only brought these two down here so you could sacrifice them for my children. Your children are dead, Salim. You're a fool, Salim. This has always been about Emma. You promised me! I stayed here and managed these dead souls! Relived their lives over and over again! I've had to watch my own children die, day after day! And now you're telling me there is no demon, there's just your sister? You owe me! [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [GROANING] [HUMMING] [HUMMING] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -[GUN COCKS] -Stop, Eugene! You can't do this! [JESSIE WHIMPERS] Come, Daddy! We're happy here! Come play with us forever! [GUN FIRES] No! You've wasted 30 years! [GAGGING] [DEMONIC LAUGHTER] Emma! Sweet little Emma. Forever a child. Please forgive me. I love you! [SCREAMS] [GROANS] Die! [GROANING] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Jessie. Jessie! You gotta get outta here, baby! I'm gonna find help, okay? It's going to be okay. Baby-- I don't think I'm gonna make it outta here. No, it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. [SOBBING] I love you. I love you too! Look, I love you too. Take my phone, so maybe... -maybe it will work and you can get help. -I'm gonna get some help. You's gonna be okay, right? I'm gonna get help, okay? I'll be back as soon as I can. You're gonna be okay, yeah? Goodbye, baby. [WHIMPERS] -FEMALE VOICE: The number you've reached- -Oh, you're freakin' useless! Help! Where's my car? Shit! It's going to be okay? I'll be back soon, okay? I gotta find help. [CAR HONKS] Wait! Stop! Please help! Stop! Thank you. I need your help. Do you have a phone? I need to call the police. I hope you're not one of those drunk college students that throws up in my back seat. You puke, it's a $100 cash fee. No, no, no! I'm not drunk. I need the police! My boyfriend has just been shot! Well, I don't have my phone with me, but I can take you to the police station. You okay? You look like someone tried to hurt you. Please, just take me to the police station. Go! Jeez. Just trying to be polite. Wait. wait. Do you have to go down there? Yes. Where did you get that? That was in my car! Hey! Your car? -What the hell is going on? -[DRIVER LAUGHS] Why? Wanna take a selfie, Jessie? Oh, my... Oh, my God! Oh! So now you wanna play hard to get? This is gonna be fun. [YELLS] Look at that girl run! Good thing I got my runnin' boots on! I'm coming for you, Jessie! [DOOR OPENS] [PANTING] Asshole! JESSIE: David? [SHOUTS] David! Where are you? [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] Where you going, Jessie? Wanna play hide and seek, do you? JESSIE: David, where are you? Come out, come out, wherever you are! [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Damnit, Jessie! Why are you such a bitch? [GRUNTS] [GROANS] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Go to hell, you son of a bitch. David! David? [SCREAMS] What are you doing here? Wait. [INTRIGUING MUSIC PLAYING] -David? David! -DAVID: I'm up here at the bar! Oh, my God. David. I can't believe I found you! I love you. Okay come on, we have to go. You don't look so good. Come on, let's sit down. Let's make a toast, hmm? To our victory. [DRINK POURING] Cheers. What's the matter? Aren't you going to drink up? Come on. Up, up, up, drink, drink! No! No! I'm not in the mood for whiskey! I mean you have no idea what I've been through since I left for help! That stalker guy from the antique store stole my car and took that creepy furry thing with him. I mean, he picked me up in a fake taxi and is in here trying to hurt me. Didn't you hear him? He's crazy! No, I'm sorry. I can't say that I heard anything. I've been a little busy myself, dealing with dead kids tormenting me, and that dead guy Thomas, he hangs himself in front of me, and then I crawl to the elevator and back to our room. I'm sorry but I... oh no no no... [SOBBING] There you are. [GRUNTS] And who's this? I thought you said that your boyfriend was shot and dying? Did you lie to me, Jessie? Or is he one of the dead bodies in the basement? Now, now. Be nice. I was shot, but I'm feeling much better now. I think Jessie just over-reacted when she saw so much blood. Jessie, Jessie, how many times do I have to tell you the dangers of too much online exposure? David! [LAUGHS] No more exposure when I'm through with you. Apologize to her! [DEMONIC] Now. [INTRIGUING MUSIC PLAYING] I'm really sorry. I love Jessie. I think she's so pretty. And smart and funny. And she was nice to me when I was a total creep. I'm really sorry, it was a huge misunderstanding. -I won't do it again. -Shh. It's okay. I'm sorry, Jessie. [NECK CRACKS] [KNOCKING] What's wrong, Jessie? I thought that you loved me. I was gonna propose to you. But when I got back to our room, the ring was gone. Any idea where it went? No, David. I have no clue. What's wrong with you? [MOCKING] "What's wrong with you?" Stop, David! [DAVID CHUCKLES] Come here, Jessie. Come here, Jessie. [DEMONIC] Come here, Jessie. Stay with me. And we can live. Here! Forever. Hmm? Hmm? [SCREAMS] [GUN FIRES] David. I'm so sorry. David. [CRYING] David. I'm so sorry... [CRYING CEASES] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [POP MUSIC PLAYING] [ENGINE ROARS]
