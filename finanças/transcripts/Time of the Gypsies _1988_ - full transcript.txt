They want to mess up my life, prick my brain with injections. I'm not mad to accept that. They order me to eat powders, to swallow electric bulbs. They've bind my soul and lead it like a bear. I am not Bozana the she-bear. They want my wings. What will my spirit do without wings? My spirit flies. She cries, sings or laughs, when she wants to. When God lived down here, he couldn't get along with us Gypsies, so he had to go up there. It's not my fault. Playing Propagate, procreate. God help me. You would beat me even if you threw them the wrong way. Everything I earned has gone. If only i had a person in front of me, i wouldn't be sorry about it. But no, he's a swine. He takes and he smiles. God, what have I done to you? I'll give it all. I'll even sell my house if i need to. Just as long as I beat him. I'll work for 20 years, if that's my destiny. My fate will change, and I'll have more luck. If you would help me once more, God. Did you get drunk? Do you want to ruin my wedding? Speak! What should I do now? Music Directed by God, for once, help me. The house will be white like milk. I must tidy up my house, so my leg sees a white God. Here, take the money. Thank you for healing my husband. Take the turkey for luck. I don't charge for healing. A little more, a little more. Eat. Don't cry Daca, I beg you. Perhan, look what i've brought you. Is it mine? - Only yours. You obey me. You're grandma's sweetheart. Mine alone? -Yours! You're a good person, you work, you take care of your sister. Danira, look. -I'll give you my soul if you're a good boy. Whose bird is this? - Perhan's. He works. You give everything you get to Perhan. He's a good boy. -You give Perhan everything, but nothing to me. I'm not a war criminal! Don't you see? Don't act stupid. - I'll lose my mind. Perhanu this, Perhanu that! Eveything only to Perhan! You and your Perhan can live in Yugoslavia, i'm going to Germany. I'm leaving! Get it? Go away! What have you done to me? You've disgraced me! - Why are you beating me? Don't curse me, mother! Woman, where is that actor of yours? Look, what he did to my daughter. Do you have any problems, old woman? I'll put out his eyes! I'll kill him! Don't push me away, old woman. Where is your son? Call him immediately. Call him! - Sit, calm down. I won't sit. I want you to call your son. Find him at once. - You chat a lot. He pumped up my daughter, and she's not even 11 years old. Find him at once! He disgraced her. Why did you come to me? - I'll pull out your eyes! Call your son at once! He ruined my daughter. I'll kill you. -Me? Look at you, what a disgrace! Stop it. - And you? You felt nice, when you lied under him. I know your tricks. You want money. You have to pay because your son fucks anything that moves. My brothers will castrate him. -Sit down. Ok, I'll sit down. There. I sit. Call your son. Let him say, if he'll marry her. If he wants her, you can do nothing about it. When she sees my son her eyes are like blinkers. Don't tell me! - She just winks, gives herself to others. Blinkers? Shame on you, old woman. Winged, sunny bird. What trouble brought you here, child? Worse then trouble. Ruza turned the house upside down. She wants everything to glare on holiday. Perhan, give the girl some special lime! Do you hear me? I've come to buy soome lime. Go, run! Sit down. Who'll carry such a sack? I will, if you'll help me. Do you know how to make lime? Listen. The most important thing is temperature. Without constant fire you cannot burn lime. Fire is the basis of everything. Wood burns, smoke goes through the oven, the air warms up, iron plate gets white-hot. Limetone burns and then goes out. In the end everything turns to white dust . Only God knows, how much is heat is needed for it. Do you know how to kiss? No house would be white without lime, plum jam would be sour. Do you know how to kiss? - Grandma thinks, that lime was the breast of the rocky mother. Mother of the forest and mother of the rock had a quarrel. The forest mother tore her breast off with her teeth. That's why lime is white as milk. The earth gave it birth, the water baptised it, the fire breast-fed it . You don't know how to kiss. I know, in a film way. Like Richard Gere. At dawn we'll be in Mexico. - At dawn? Is it hot in Mexico? - It's hot. It'll be wonderful. You, me, muchachos. Calm down. How long can you kiss without breathing in? Fifteen or twenty minutes. No! My God! You've got magnet on your lips. Shall I show you something? Look at the can. Fata morgana! Stop, the can! Stop! You've come to propose her ? Me. What? You're proposing? This brat has come to spoil our Vasilica! Look at him! Inside! -Azra, stay here. What? I said inside the house! Azra, stay here! Inside, if I tell you! Are you deaf? You've ruined my life. What's up with you? You've swallowed up my soul. And you! You army bastard! One doesn't know what faith you belong to! Neither Gypsy nor non-Gypsy. You haven't got a single penny in your pocket ! You army bastard! What are you waiting for, get lost! And you? You're silent as a grave! You don't even open your mouth, you asshole! You've turned into a grave! My God! Has anybody seen anything like it? Help me neighbours! He wants to kill me! Help! He'll kill me! I'll pull out your eyes! Help! Is anybody there? Hurry, neighbours! He wants to slaughter me! Dear grandma! In a world, that does not understand me, there is no place for me. When I finish writing this lettes, I'll swallow it. I don't want anybody to find it, because I would be later ashamed, of killing myself because for a woman. I cannot live a second more without Azra. Her mother, the three-headed snake, does not allow me to see her. Yours, Perhan. My name is not Zabit, if I don't jump over the shadow! One, two, three, now! Damned shadow! The moonlight smiles. Azra! Around fire we snivel, cry rises, my shadow shivers, laughter lowers. What is this pet doing at this hour? Azra! I love you! - I'm going! Who are you, politician, to hang yourself? Come down immediately! Down, I said! Damn you, you stupid fool! You'll hang here? Come down. Neighbour! Open! It's me, Zabit Mehmedovski. Come in. Welcome. Happy Vasilica! - May God be with you. Good luck. I've brought you this donkey. I rather not tell where I found it. What are you doing? -I'm crying. Does he cry too? -He cries. You see she's sorry too. I'll bring the accordion, so you'll play for grandma. Fool! If you were my son, I would kill you this moment!. Here, the accordion. Play. Play the one that grandma likes. It's absolutely romantic outside. Too bad we're not young, so we could dance in the park. Why wouldn't you dance with such a handsome man? How do you like it? Absolutely romantic! You'll burn me! Grandma, are you sleeping? I'm sleeping. You sleep as well. Grandma, sit down by my side. Was my mother beautiful? Like a mountain fairy. When she gave birth to Daca, her belly stretched. I went to a witch. She said, that she came upon a a water devil. She gave her some spells, but nothing helped. I took her to a hodja. Germany is my homeland. Merdzan, why didn't your return there? He said she betrayed the path of the ancestors. He read to her from the Koran on his head. To no purpose. The doctor gave her the medicines and injections, but to no avail. She died in my hands. She was young. God gave, God took. What can I do. Daca's father is not my father? No. Your father is a Slovenian. He was here in the army. He promised your mother heaven on earth, but then he left. Then I'm an army bastard. Ruza told the truth. Let her eat shit! You are grandmas child. Sleep now. Go back, we're not going together today. Sit there and take care of Daca. Are you deaf? Everbody here! Let them see who came! Ahmed Dida, champion. Ahmed, you rich man, what a car have you got! From distant Italy, everything shines on it! Hi, Ahmed. How are you? What a nice dress! White feather! Care for a game? -At twelve at the old place. Deal, no problem. I've ran away from a madhouse. Give me some money. I've come as a man, to propose your daughter. Go out. Out. Why do you drag along like a cat? Get lost at once. I beg you. Even my grandma agreed. You've come to propose her? I said, I will not give her away. You have no job. You have no working skills. You should learn to transfer money into banks rather the cans. Slowly. My daughter is a beauty. You're not worth her. Get lost! Do I have to tell you a hundred times? Get lost! Calm down. - I won't calm down! Grandma, help. A lot of people are proposing her! Do you want to tear off my grandson's head? What madness has gone into you? -Sit, aunty. I will. I want my grandson to ger married. I'll bring the money. I'll give it to you. Here, look. What can your grandson do? He can move cans back and forth. Why can't he transfer money into banks? And your money doesn't mean a thing to him. What would he do with it? My daughter is worth billions. I didn't give her to anyone. Come, Azra. Look at her. Beauty! All white. You're very proud of her. Why not? Look at her. Take your grandsons hand and leave. I'll be back. You'll be kissing my feet. Bitch! Get lost. This treasure is not for you. I'm a great she-devil. I'll bring you trouble. You'll be kissing my feet! Get lost! Head up! It's never later for jumping into water and marrying. So use your head, grandma's sweetheart. Did you sell the lime? - No. It's not going well. When do you intend to return your depth? -Tomorrow. We're leaving tomorrow. Come here. - Where are we going? Where are we going? -Into the circle. So police doesn't take us by surprise. You can repay everything. Maybe even earn something. Two cards. Uncle, come home at once! Robert is choking. He'll die. Mother, save me! They've fleeced me. - You've got the receipts there. They're not pregnant women. I owe money to dangerous people. Do you hear me? I've got into bad company. Don't chase my dreams away. Give me the money. They'll scatter my brains all over. I'll show you! Give me the money, for fucks sake! I'll kill you all! Give me the money, now! For the last time: money or life! Where should I get it? Do you want my soul? You've got the money! - I don't have it. You're keeping it in your pants. You keep it for the wedding. I don't have it. Leave me, you fool! Leave my brother and grandma alone! Give me the money! I'll kill you all! Find it! You've ruined us, you dicer! So you won't give me the money? Now you'll see. Damn all you dead and living! Give me the money! I don't have it, fool! From where would i have it? Don't you see it's raining? The child won't stop crying. Where should I get the money from? - I'll show you! I've been born without a father, my mother took care of me. I'll never forget my grandmother. Don't cry, grandma. Will you give me the money? When you find the money, I'll return the house. Don't cry, mother. You fool, fool. God have mercy on you. Once there was the sky and earth husband and wife. They had five children: sun, moon, fire, fog and wing. They built a wonderful city and settled them there . The bantering sun wanted to separate the earth from the sky, but it didn't succeed. Others have tried as well, but with no avail. When wind rushed at them with all its power, the earth separated from the sky. Hatidza! It's a matter of life! Save my child at once! No matter the price! Blood is the biggest secret. Blood and power. Listen. The child's spirit has not yet been woken. Merdzan, my son! My eyes! Who did this to you? His brothers. What did you do, you scoundrels? I treat your child, and this is how you repay me. Your disgusting! Get lost, you scoundrel! My sweetheart, mother's sunshine. They've disgraced us. Is this your gratitude? I haven't the slightest idea, I swear by my son. May they all die on me, if I know anything about it. I'll show them, to the very last one. Here, take as much as you want. Get lost, you scoundrel. What will the money do me any good? Nobody lifted a hand upon Ahmeda Dzida. God proteced you, for saving my son. My sweetheart, my life. Come handsome, we'll take care of everything.. You've slaughtered my turkey. Now I'll slaughter you. You fools! You're sucking my blood. You'll bury me alive in the grave. What are you doing? Where should i run from these fools? Go in your bed. Fuck the turkey! I'll buy you three hundred others. - This one was mine. I'll buy you three hundred turkeys. Sit down. Calm down. You're driving my nuts. Stop it. What are you doing you bastard? You're beating your uncle. Poor fellow. When I get you, i'll brake your neck. I'll brake it like this. I'll kill you, you miserable soul. You'll lose all your teeth! I'll break you into pieces like a pumpkin! If you hit me one more time you bastard, I'll crush you! You should be kissing my feet. Where are you going? Sit. I've remembered. Would you like to pay for Robert? You've said yourself that doctors couldn't help him. Speak. - Do you see that girl? Did you see her leg? There's a hospital in Ljubljana, where they extend the bones. You pay for that and we're even. When I go to Italy, I'll leave her in Ljubljana. I won't leave her alone. I will go with her. Please do, it's the right thing to do. Relatives help each other. I'll drive both. Don't cry, Daca. I'll go with you. I can't go to a hospital. I am afraid I'll die there. Don't be afraid. Merdzan! What have you done, you fool? Leave him alone, he's crazy. Devils have possesed him. Look, what he's done to the house. Why are you looking at them? They're good as angels. They won't present trouble for you. Listen, is this hereditary ? - The leg? -You're skills. Can anyone from them do something like that? Perhan knows a little bit. Nothing useful. What's not useful? - Nothing, doesn't matter. -What? Perhan, show him what you can do. He wants to drive your sister to the hospital so she will recover. Show him for your sister's sake. - I can't. Show him, do you hear me?! - I can't. He'll heal your sister. Show him what you can do. Elvis, Jaser, Rambo! Bring the "documents" instruments. Take care of them like the pupil of the eye. They're everything I have. Don't worry. This taxi driver is the best. He came especially from Brcko. You'll have a leg like Marilyn Monroe. Neighbours, good luck. Come back in good health! You should go as well. I'll open you an ambulance in my van. I can't, I'm sick. Don't cry, grandma. She'll come back. If it was fine, I wouldn't cry. I forgot to give you the food for your trip. Don't cry, Daca. Everything played out like in dreams. I'm leaving, wait for me. Comply with everything that I inform you through grandma. Love me like your eyes. When I return, you'll live like a minister. My sister and grandma will live with us. Ok? When you see your uncle, run to the other side of the quart. Deal? -Yes. Don't cry, Hatiza. From today you need your eyes to take care of my bride. Make sure, that her feet wont be wondering more in the sky, then stepping on earth. How can I not cry, if my soul hurts? Take care of your sister like the pupil of the eye. Don't cry. Irfan! When the king of wind fell upon mother, the sky separated from the earth. The the suns... Don't cry, Daca. I ask you like God. Promise me, that you won't leave me with them. I'll do everything, just don't cry. -I've stopped. I see mother. You see? Is she beautiful? -Very much. What does she look like? She's got hair, eyes, nose, lips, everything. Good day, doctor. We've talked on the phone. Don't leave me alone, I beg you. She is afraid. I told her, that she'll have a leg like Marilyn Monroe, when she's in your hands. What's your name, little beauty? - Denira Feric. -Good girl. Don't be afraid, Daca. Comrad Tito was treated here himself. Let me look at you. Doctor, I'll stay with her. How can you demand that, if you're healthy? You can't do that, Ahmed. Do you have any documents? - I'm sorry, you can't go here. Health insurance? You just admit her. In two days you'll get everything. How can you demand to stay with the child? Who will feed you, where will you sleep? Aren't you ashamed of taking a place of a patient? I've promised grandma. We promised that we'll cure her leg.. Go with me to Italy.. You'll work, you'll be able to build a house. She's got osteomielitis. She has to be operated. What is it? - The operation is expensive. Perhan! Don't leave me alone, please! Please, don't leave me! Don't leave me alone. Now you aren't doing well. When you'll earn millions, you'll be grateful to me. Where are these babies from? - I bought them on the way. Why? So Robert would have company. It suck nicer, if it's not alone. Grownups prefer breasts for themselves, children don't. Who sells them in such small size? Those who have to. He has 11 of them. He found himself a mistress, who gave him these two as a present. She's married too. To hide her shame, she gave them to me. Look at him! He's gifted as his father! Zef, the cowboy film has just begun. Feebles, damn you! Take off your clothes! To the bone! Come in. You're next. - Go fuck yourself! I'll hit you right in the forehead! When he comes to you, say "ottanta". If he says "cinquanta", say yes. Now get lost. Read! They've imposed on my taxes for the last six years.. Two penalties, three offences and one sentence. I have to give everything, or they will evict me. What do I have to do with this? Where should I get money from for your sister? How? Read it, if you don't believe me. I'm poor as a church mouse. Ruined. They've fried me. Not to mention the bill for Roberta and the hospital! That is yet to come. Help me a bit! I'll help, but in a fair way. And what fair thing can you do? One after another, God may give you luck. That's it, only fair. Bosnian, come back. Stand on the chair. Who told you to do this? Shut up! If he doesn't want to work, he just doesn't have to! He won't heal his sister, he won't build a house, he won't get married. Give him the money, let him be damned. When you return to Ljubljana, take your sister. Do you understand? I feel pity for her. You live like a dog! In dust nibble the bones. Give him the money for the trip. Let him pack and go to the station. Perhan, look. Dear grandma! I'm alive and healthy. Don't you worry about me. I'm in Milano. The beauty and wealth is breathtaking. One can cross himself from the astonishment. If you were here, you could not get a wink from the happiness. Unlce Ahmed used to nicely tell you: We could have a sack of money. This isn't important now. Take care of my Azra, so she doesn't end like the neighbour, whose feet wondered more in the sky, then stepped on the earth. My Hatidza! I have realised here that God, is not a blind cat. Ahmed is like a father to me. He speaks Italian, barks at the stars. He has his people everywhere, lawyers, judges, priests and cops. He takes care of me like I was his son. I will earn a lof of money. I'll build a house, just like Ahmed's. Only I'll build according to an italian plan. A painter will paint this picture on the frontage. Don't worry about Danira. I've seen with my own eyes that the doctor is Ahmed's man. What should I buy you? I've bought uncle a TV. He can put it in his pocket, let the whole world stand openmouthed. Latest technological advancement. I won't spare with the money for the wedding. Let the old and the young remember Perhan's wedding. Yours, Perhan. Where is Irfan? Where is Irfan, you nitwit? - I don't know. Irfan's not here. -What do you mean? Why didn't you pay attention? Don't appear before my eyes without him! Out! Don't come without him. Where should I look for him? - Be off with you! Your problem! That's nothing. Tears? Oh my, mommy, that's not good. What's missing in your full house? Tell me please, what! Take the white coffee, white bread, white cheese. Take the marmelade, bird's milk. Everything that I have. You want a leave, to go on sick leave? What do you want first? Shame on you, son. / Is this thank you? / I'm crazy and naive because I trust people. Remember - without work there is no happiness. What did you do? You've turned my life into manure! Who's the boss here? Who gives the orders here? Damn your spoilt blood! Who's the boss?! What is up with you, Ahmed? Give me the tablets for pressure. Give me the tablets! Who is your husband - him or me, you Gypsy bitch?! Come, come. I've come to tell you, what your grandma is telling you . If you don't come immediately, the silverteeth will eat you . Woman with the silver teeth is the wolf's victim. Woman with the silver teeth is the wolf's victim... Quick, get up! Go! Why are you hesitating? Everybody out! Everybody to the police! Let's go! All to the police! They will take your passport. He says not to move from here. That is good, it cures. You are my brother. Are you sending money for my sister's health treatment? Every first in the month. For the house too. The foundation has already been laid. Now they're building walls. I only have you and Robert left. Dzamila. Everyone come here! From today on Perhan is the parade commander. Obey him more then Zef or Sadama. Is that clear? Young man! Are you looking for someone? They are now mine. Do you know that? Look. Tell the big boss, that Sadam is not crazy, to rot in jail because of him. You know, I put the guilt on Zef. And he, as it befits for the younger brother, took all the blame on himself. Ciao, handsoome. Fuck that luck. Buy ones like these. For the business. Some baby. And some pregnant woman. It's easier to get across the border. My God, look. An entirely different person. Something of each if it's possible. That's the best. May God bless you, I'm counting on you. Where is that house of mine, that is being built? I would like to see the construction. House? Next to mine. Where else would it be? Are we brothers or not? But you musn't go to our place. - Why not? That's what the lawyer said, that acuired the passport for you. There's a big confusion. It's being reported in newspapers, on radio, TV. They've made a movie about people, that sell children abroad. Don't go there, please. Go to the ferryboat Bari-Bar, and then to Monte Negro and Bosnia. I wanted to see grandma and Azra, to visit my sister in Ljubljana. No, by no means, please. Only to the south. He're the address of a man from Tuzla. Find a wife for me. I'll sen Dzamila away. Rate her as you would rate her for yourself. Go, good luck. Come here! I'm not guilty, I don't know anything. May I get blind if i know anything. I don't know anything. I've come as it befits. Oh my. Billions! I don't have to kiss hands. - Is this for me? Look at him the big businessman. How did you earn that much money? He came so he would trick my daughter with the money. Look! Did she get married? -No. What can I do. Woman like woman. She did what she decided. I don't know how to deal with her. I wonder myself. What should I do with her? I don't know myself! And the child she bears? It's supposably yours. What do you think? - Ask your uncle. God, what are you doing to me? A black train has come mother. It has come, mother, a black morning. Neighbour, there is no sense in drinking that much. I also drank brandy, but it doesn't help. Look, the drink has changed you into a woman. Like you aren't happy, to see me. Grandma loves you. What are you doing to your head? Come, don't be afraid. You've come with me. What lays on your heart, grandma? Mine is fine. What's with yours? Where did you leave your sister? In Ljubljana. She should return back soon. Bring me a glass of brandy. You take the chair and sit down. Why does your wife cry? The bitch has to let out water, and she releases it through her eyes. Why do you trust your mother-in-law more then your wife? Since I've got myself lying, I don't trust noone anymore. If you don't trust at all, God will abandon you. Where did you get this? Where did you get these clothes? I've earned it with these ten fingers. I will build a house with them as well. Who will live in this house? You and me, grandma. I will not live in this house. My spirit doesn't want to. God forbid, that you would live in this house. Don't speak like that. What have you become. You were honest once. Now you changed for the worse. What am I like, grandma? You've broken my heart. You've spoilt entirely. Let me tell you something son. All this is a fata morgana. You gave me money. I may die tomorrow. Who will return you? Take the money back. You've burnt your hand! You know how that hurts. You're doing yourself evil things. Stop playing! You're playing madness. You'll kill a man. Back! Perhan, wait for me. Neighbour, you're blind drunk! What are you looking at? Get in! My neighbour is my concern. Chandelier! Scales! Cooker! This present is from a wedding witness. Let's see what's inside. A bit of silence, please. Bread! Money! Gold! A limuosine is coming. The chauffeur is opening the door. The bride is stepping out. The groom is carrying her in his arms. Mother-in-law is offering the daughter-in-law bread and sugar, so she would have a sweet life. Be happy. The groom kisses the bride. Mother-in-law leads daughter-in-law into the house. The groom is being beaten to obtain power. He'll need it. Grandma and her grandson will now dance. How beautiful he is, how elegant, wise, civilized and pedantic! Grandma's grandson. My living monument. Get up, come with me. You and Ruza must help me. Find some cripples to go begging and a pregnant woman with the same fate, as mine has. Here's your advance. We'll find some cripples. And how do you intend to sell your own child? You will meet with a terrible accident. First, the child is not mine. I will bring up no bastard. And second, I won't repeat. Only under these conditions will I marry her. Go out so they won't see us. Are you building another house here? If we built it you would see it. A house is not a needle. If there is a God, the kids will go into the world, to work and earn money. They just musn't disgrace themselves. Let them build a house like other people, with their own labor by the sweat of their face. I am already old. I can't work anymore. Why not? They're still young. You know we burn lime. Merdzan doesn't want to work. May I come to you? Not even dead. Did you understand? I can hardly wait that Perhan, my sweetheart, returns. I can hardly wait that he gets a child. So that this wish of mine turns true as well. Do with me whatever you want. But why? You know well why. Don't foist me a magpie instead of a gosling. This child is diligent, obedient, qualified. I'm sorry for speaking about this. Something is pressing me in my soul, so words are like a cure. My son comes at midnight, the house is for him like an inn. He eats and goes to the whores. I don't know what's wrong with him. My golden one, Perhan, is the best person in this world. He's not like my son, bastard. If you knew what kind of daughter I had. His mother was a beauty. He looks just like her. She died young. I fell ill because of her. What should I tell you? Are you alive? -I'm alive. Here, eat. Perhan, you must believe me. The child is ours. Merdzan assaulted me when I was three months pregnant. Don't lie. Shut up, don't lie. I'm not lying. -I don't want to bring up a bastard! I will sell him. Then will make our own child. Give me your hand. This one is ours too. Believe yourself, if you don't believe me. I concieved when we slept together on St. George's Day. I've calculated everything. I swear by my life. I know he's a bastard. We'll make our own. I said what I said. Why? This one is ours too. Wait. Something in me has turned upside down. I dreamt that you gave birth to a white bird. When I came near. Wait. What do you want? You've done everything well. But where is a wife for me? Couldn't you find her? Where is my house? Why did you lie about building a house for me? Were you at home? From where would I bring my wife then? I thought. - What did you think? That you picked up one on the way. What do i know. You know, Ahmed. You know everything. Why did you lie to me? - Sadam lied to me! I gave him the money for your house. He put it into his own pocket. He came yesterday to laugh in my face. I'm sorry, I'm not responsible for your house. I swear by my child. Believe me. If you don't want to, go. Leave me alone. May I die. I will give you half of my house. Here are the papers. I will call the lawyer tomorrow so they will certify it in court. I may not be much long. And Robert? I loved him more then life. And now? I don't know. I obsere him every day and everything seems suspicious to me. The eyes, the nose, hands. He doesn't look like me in any way. We're brothers in that way as well - the wives cheated on us both. Boy! Look, Perhan! A boy! Let us not bewitch him. Azra! No, Azra. I ask you like God, don't leave me! I love you! Azra! God is nevertheless a blind cat. He looked at me while I was hiding treasure in the canal. He tied my sould with a rope and let the flood wash away the gold and money. First he gave me wealth, in the end with the treasure he took my soul as well. I had so much gold, dear Hatidza, that I could build a house out of gold coins. and cover the roof with them. We could build a big house, we could touch the moon from its roof. A cruel fate has come upon me. The more I rack my brain about where it came from, the bigger is the earthquake in my head and the more I go away from the truth. Maybe you have also put a spell on me, grandma Tidza when I told you that I don't trust anyone anymore, when I caught myself lying. You told me then: If you don't trust at all, God will abandon you. You won't be good nor to God nor to people. You know, I am not like that good to people, but i was deceived by a man, whom I trusted more then God. Ahmed was both God and father for me. I wrote to you that Daca stayed at the hospital. Even your own eyes can decieve yourself. If I could, I would put out my eyes and get blind. Only later I have realised, what a trap Ahmed set me up. Where is he? - He ran away. -Where? Who knows. He drove me away and found himself another woman. Dzamila, talk, if you know. He has reconciled with his brothers. They united the slaves and disappeared. Did you take my sister from Ljubljana? Where? Speak, I'll kill you! Leave him alone, you fool! To Rome. May God give you luck. Help the poor girl. Did you see this girl? - No, I don't know her. Fuck you! Fuck you, asshole! You said I shouldn't return home without Danira. I travelled the whole world from end to end. Ahmed as though as he would turn into a mole, and Danira is nowhere to be seen. I've been looking for Ahmed for three years. I'd like to live 300 years, just to find him and pull out his heart. I've been searching for her for days. This has made me turn into wind, my dreams have evaporated like dust. I can't dream anymore. A gypsy without dreams is like a church without a roof, like a textbook without letters. Yours, Perhan. Danira! Perhan! Brother! God! As long as I have found you! And your leg? Does it hurt? Same. Oh my. You know what happened? -What? He said that the hospitals in Italy are better. That they will admit us here . That you and I will be together. Since then I have been begging. He have travlled over 101 cities. Today he's getting married. - Ahmed? -Yes. And you have a son. He's just like you. They're waiting that he grows up, so they can sell him. Perhan! What is it? What's your name? - Perhan. And yours? Perhan. Don't lie! Why are you lying? Hurry up, please. Go, they will see us.. This is your father. Give him your hand. Wait for me here. I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere, please. I must buy a gift for grandma. Come back soon. Buy her a dishwashing sponge. Don't forget about my accordion. - Don't worry. If I'm late, I will catch up with you on the next stattion. Take it. What's wrong? - I'm sad. Don't be. Let' wave to him. Daddy! Perhan, stop! I am angry with you. -Why? You won't return, you won't buy me an accordion Let me be damned, If I don't return. Go now. Go. Irfan! Is it you, Perhan? Help me. -Don't worry. What cigarettes do you smoke? Good cigarettes! Cover my back. - Don't' you worry. Ahmed, good luck! Dance, Ahmed! Where are you, birdie? Look at him, Ahmed. Where are you, Perhan, my child? I've come to you. I'll serve you till I die. You are my father. You and God. Accept me or kill me. Why would I kill you, you poor fellow? Kill me, sinful thoughts have come to my mind. Give him food to eat. Look how thin he is. Who is this? - Some fool, a poor man. Eat the cake! Die in shit! Hurry up. Quick, to the bridge. I will kill you for preventing my marriage! Run. You've ruined my youth, and I'll destroy your head. Let it be, what shall be. I will catch up with you, even if you were a bird. For fuck sake! Oh, God! God, what have you done? You have turned as though the whole world has turned. Merdzan will lift you up again, but you must help me. If you can't, I'll lift you up myself. Did you see Perhan? Why? He left you without a father and mother, but he washed your feet. He didn't know how to call you. You let him among the wolves. Lead him where you think is the best place in that world. Do you see these two dices? Let them fall, for once let them fall, as I wish. My wish would come true. And may I not be Merdzan anymore, if I don't fulfill your wish. And throw the dices like they should be. Translation by: Bluester
