My name is Maria. This story takes place at Honey Bunny, a nightclub in Kawasaki. I worked there till yesterday. I was Killed by one of them. Is this for real? Kojima Kazunori, a waiter at Honey Bunny. Goes by Koji. A punk whose hobby is martial arts. Got a good heart but no brains. Big Ken, where's your gun? Darn, I left it in the car. Kanamori Ken, who insists on being called 'Big Ken'. A club regular. The girls kiss up to this pervert only because this Korean BBQ chain owner is a sugar daddy. What were you thinking? Shall I... No, forget it. Kiyohara Shuuzou, the manager of Honey Bunny. He's called 'Shu' by the girls and is somewhat respected. He's taken Koji under his wing, living together, So may be gay. Want more? I'm just watching over them now. Will they each get one-third of the money they stole? ONE THIRD Can't we go out now? No, cops are out there. It's so quiet. - Don't be fooled. - Relax a bit. They were chasing us. - We lost them. - Yeah, barely. Nah, they lost us. How can you tell? They haven't come in. Maybe waiting for backup. Shu, we're fine. How can you be sure? What's with you? - If arrested... - Shut it. Think 'if' in a good way. Not now. Think 'if we pull this off.... Come on, we're here with the money. - What's your plan? - Dream later. - Drink in a jacuzzi. - Don Perignon? Chateau Petrus '82 the most expensive Bordeaux wine. No clue, but if you say so. - You can join me. - Thanks! It's no time for that. How about you? Bang a hot girls. A call girl? No. I'll do Beyonce. - Fool. - Throw her 1 million yen. She won't spread her legs for that. Seriously? What a snob. Snob? You never stood a chance. Then Lady Gaga. Why not a Japanese girls? Risa Stegmayer. She's only part Japanese. She's Japanese. No, doesn't sound nor look like one. - Christel Takigawa. - Half correct. - Choi Ji-Woo. -She's Korean. No Japanese girls? - Rino Katase. - So mature! Hey, this is no joke! Sorry, it's him... Split the money. Koji, I need to talk to you first. What is it? Hey, what's that look? Cut it out, this can't be good. You see, Koji, you were the driver. Yeah. Big Ken and I went into the bank. What's your point? Well, maybe you getting one-third is too much? Wait, for real? For real. What's this? Ganging up on me? Big Ken, you in on this? Well, kind of... -Yes or no! - Calm down. No way! You needed me. Or you couldn't have got away! But the risk, Shu killed a hostage. She might be alive. I died. Life is full of twists and turns. I was a musical actress before I came to Honey Bunny. Use the accident to your advantage. The words of our stage director. You never know what'll happen on stage. Accidents are bound to happen. That's when your acting skills will be put to test. He'd always proudly lecture us. You, get up. The stage sure is full of accidents. It was an accident. Who cares? Say Shu and me 40% each, and Koji 20%? You only drove but far better than a cabbie. Don't you dare darn me now! But we sure did take a bigger risk. Where to? Getting a smoke. Why now? Besides, smoke here! I want both the smoke and fresh air. And check on cops. Why's he such a loner? Who brought it up? Doesn't matter. I said, who? Forget it. I'll settle for less, so tell me. You sure? - Yeah. - You said it. Just tell me. Shu's idea. I see. So forget about getting one-third, all right? Sure. I'll take half. You take the other half. What do you mean? I'll go get your gun from the car. What the... That one's not loaded. We can't kill Shu with it. "7 Days Before Bank Hit" Darn it! Am I ever going to win? If I lose my next race, I'll be broke for 20 days till my next payday. In the bag was 4 million yen, the revenue of Honey Bunny. I was to take it to the owner after the race. I can't touch this. The owner Sho Hama is named after the demon of destruction and actor Sho Aikawa. Don't mess with me. Not only his name, but he's got a deadly personality. Don't mess with me... Don't mess with me... My predecessor took off with our hostess and 5 million yen in sales. Let's bang. - Yeah. - Awesome! But he was found, stabbed with an ice pick. The girl was exploited by Hama. How goes it? And became a porn star. If I touch this money, my life would end with an ice pick. Cleft-chin Tarantino? I once worked for a high school buddy. Wakame, Central 208, all options. It was a boring job, so I watched many films. I particularly liked Tarantino films. So simple-minded, I dreamed of becoming a film director. I had my buddy read my script. Your plot is so interesting. Thank you. I'm in tears. It's a horror. He was totally high, so his words were unreliable. Hilarious! It's a horror story. I then joined a film production company as a runner. 'The Dancing Shoreline', a gay porn film. Cut! As I watched the fundoshi pants spin, my passion for film dried up. What? Jackie Brown? Jackie Brown is a Tarantino film. My two favorites, plus a long shot. I thought this was destiny. Come on, 4-8, Jackie Brown. It's all you or nothing. Come on, 4-8... good. You're all I've got, come on. Come to daddy. Come on. You can do it... Getting there, no? It's here... I got it! Come on! Do it... Come on, you can do it! No. 4 won? So 4-a, right? For real? I nailed it? Jackpot! I did it! Excuse me. Here. How much in total? 471,400 yen. 471,000 yen, I did it! Awesome! I did it! Crap, the bag... Huh? What? Where? What? Have you seen a zippered bag? Did you see a bag? Oh crap! Oh, a bag! I found it! It's my bag! I'm dead. I don't want to die! Maria? Why you so surprised? Why you here? You look like it's the end of the world. Maria seemed like an angel who came to Kawasaki Racecourse. I told her everything. That's perfect! My life's in danger, too! I came here looking for you to get your advice. Your life? Why? Who? How's that perfect? First, let's take care of Hama's money. Wait, Maria, where are we going? Taxi... Where are we going? Loaning money. - From who? - Lady Shibugaki. - What? - To Horinouchi. Tamiko Shibugaki gives you any loan without a guarantor. For a week, with 20% interest. No extension allowed. Jabba the Hutt of Kawasaki. I don't know who's behind her, but even the mafias of Kawasaki listen to her. That old hag is bad news. I'd rather not go to her, either. Tamiko Shibugaki is a lesbian, and Maria is one of her favorites. If you need anything, just call me. It's Maria. Will you lend me some money? Maria's hand was shaking. It's only a rumor, but a call girl who tried to escape became her 'pet' in a tank. It's you who really needs money. As if by ESP, she knew it was me who needed money. Now I'm safe from Hama's ice pick, but I loaned from Jabba the Hutt. I'm not as courageous as Han Solo. Here. Give it back in a week or you die. Shu's going to die. Hold on, I get it. We'll split it evenly, all right? It's too late. What's wrong? It's nothing, right, Big Ken? - Where to? - The car. Fool, the streets' full of cops. I'll be fine. I'm a mere driver, after all. Hold on, Koji! What did he do to you? Listen, Shu, let's give him one-third. Koji can get out of hand. I said Maria! A customer once made a scene at Honey Bunny. Oh, Maria? I'm Marian. That's too confusing. Why would I pay to drink with you? That's so rude. You a gospel singer? I'm no gospel singer! Want me to sing at your funeral? More like a Hawaiian psychic. I'll throw you power stones. Just get me Maria! I'm sorry sir. Just forget him. Don't stand side-by-side. How can you be so different? Anyway, come here. Please, sir. Get lost! What's the matter? He's weird. I'm no weirdo. Come on... Why the scene? Kojima, escort this guest out. You shut up! Oh, no... Look, you've knocked out our poor chubby chum. Now you must pay. What's that? Koji. Finish him! You jerk! Koji... Stop it, that's enough. I couldn't help clapping since Koji's moves were so smooth. Why let him go? He'll shoot me. So I told him even split. Like he'd agree to it now. Then what? He won't listen to us. You smoking here? What happened to fresh air and all? Let's do this. Koji takes 80% and us 10% each. Sure... no way! Life's what matters. Koji wants to Kill you. You, too. Why? He'll split it with me. Koji won't share. Killing one is same as two. I doubt that. What's so funny? It's a run-down line, but with not much reality. The first Kill doesn't make the second easy. It's better to kill less, mentally, too. We tried to gyp him. No, that's you. It's the same to Koji. Then why'd he talk to me? To take us out one by one. - No... - Let's settle for 10% each. - But... - You know Koji. A snappy idiot. He's going to get a loaded gun. If you don't want to die, settle for Koji 80% and us 10% each. Darn it... why? Got it? Yeah. Let's talk to him before he gets back. I'm back. And now that I am... Hands up, you two. Excuse me. Coming, sir. "Travolta" "6 Days Before Bank Hit" I loaned from that monster. I must do it. Really? We split outside Shibugaki's place. I delivered Hama the club's sales. I'm Sho Aikawa. Dead on. Now you try... Sho Aikawa. You're not even close. - Sorry, sir. - How goes it? How goes it? You're making me laugh. - Sorry, sir. - Not even close again. I went home, dropped dead, and was out cold until the morning. Maria left a message on my phone. Hello? It's Maria. Hey, let's hit a bank. I'll call again. Why do you need money so bad? Who'd kill you? - Slow down. - Start from there. I'll tell you later. Fine. Let's talk about BB. What's BB? Bank bust. - You kidding? - No, I'm not. Yes, you are. Shu, recruit two members. Easier said than done. Who are in a bind like us. In a bind... Don't tell about me. - Why not? - You'll recruit guys. Stop it. Sure, I've a guy in mind. Guys don't like to listen to girls. I'm a guy, too. I've no time to be winning their trust. We only got six days. Fine then. Trustworthy guys. Cut that out. There's one who won't betray for sure. Who? Koji. Koji, stop! Don't yell or I might pull the trigger. Shu and I spoke and we'll cut you a deal. One-third is too late now. You take 80%. Deal? - For real? - Yeah. Come on, I brought the gun for nothing then? You agree then? Of course I do. Then put the gun back in the car. I don't want to go out. Let go of it. It's distracting. I'll go toss it. No, you haven't changed. - Don't go out. - won't go out. - Then where? - Downstairs. The bar that closed down? Just like upstairs? Bad economy. Give me the gun. No way! That's not loaded. I know you'll point it at me. - I won't. - Then unload it. I can take you both down in a fist fight. You have our word, you get 80%. Fine, then. Don't split the money yet. All right? Okay? Sure, we'll be waiting. See? I told you. You're a genius, Shu. He settled for 10%. Just as planned. You try to gyp me, I snap and go get the gun. While I talk to him. I won't go when the cops are out there. I brought his gun when I got off the car. I'll be fine. I'm a mere driver, after all. Koji! I was just waiting for your call. Let's talk to him. Then I enter the room. But I kind of feel sorry. He should know better, right? There, your usual line. Now, how to escape from here. Then leave Japan and look for foreign boobs. Hey. Think about boobs on the plane. Don't be so serious. We need to be careful. Well then, Shu, let's have a toast. We mustn't look so chill. You drink to fill the silence when you're fighting. He'll buy it. -You're... - Here, cheers! How about Maria? - Dating her? - No way. Big Ken saw you two at Travolta. Oh, that... She came to me for advice. About getting back to acting? It wasn't my choice to quit acting. Use the accident to your advantage. That stage director. He showed me a hotel room key and said... The heroine's part is open. I was desperate for that role. But it was my rival who nailed the heroine's part. I got an ugly hag's part. A typical trap in our world. I never thought I'd fall for it. I called him to the stage at night. He had forgotten about tricking me and came without any suspicion. Only one cast. The prop, a bra. So foolish, but perfect for that horny jerk. Your favorite kind of 'accident'. Many actresses hated him, but I left the company from the fear of drawing suspicion. So lame. Isn't she embarrassed of dreaming like that? Those who keep believing in something silly realize their dreams. What a romantic. - Shut it. -You sure are. Once we pull this off, let's find something. Yeah. Ogata... Sorry, I stabbed him. - What happened? - He just showed up... Still... I threatened him with a kitchen knife, but he tried to report me. So stabbed him? He's dead. Sorry, I didn't mean to kill him! "5 Days Before Bank Hit" Yelling won't help. It's sound-proofed. It's no secret Big Ken's a SM fan. The skill set of a sadist? What makes a good one? Depends on the personality? Sadists require skills, So can improve with experience. But masochism is a talent. Maybe test out your masochism? I'm a pure sadist. There's an ex-Honey Bunny dominatrix. You serious? You might get hooked. Probably he got interested in an ex-call girl dominatrix. Come in. Strip down. I'm new to this. Look at me. It's my first. I'm new to this. Pretty tight. Tying there, too? That's normal? You know what'll happen next? I paid her off and we swapped. Thanks. Enjoy, boys. Big Ken. You're deep in debt? Wanna team up? - Why now? - To see you in private. With clothes pins on my nipples? She improvised there. Take it off slowly. What's that look? I need your undivided attention. You knew about my debt? All stores are suffering from false food safety rumors. We're deep in the red. But you've a big apartment? My last pride, but can barely pay rent. Your wife? She'd divorce me if she knew, demanding alimony and all. I'm almost bankrupt. Let's turn it around. - Turn what? - Your life. You outta your mind? It's a huge debt! We'll get it. How? Hit a bank? Yes, let's. What are you saying? Let's pay back and free ourselves from debt. Free my limbs first. Right, sorry. We'll talk once we sit ourselves down. Don't start babbling. Plus body language is vital to me. Free my hands first. Why last? Oh, I can do it myself. You! I didn't mean to kill him. Crap, you killed him! - Calm down. - Sorry, really... Listen, you two. Two deaths on us! - Focus. - Forgive me! We're over! Focus! Apologizing won't revive him. Yelling won't solve it. So focus on how we can get away from all this. Sorry, I didn't think... Why was Ogata there? He'd crash after drinking. He drank last night, too? What now? Hide him? Shu... Hey Shu, say something! Good, that's it, Shu. Build their frustration. Just as planned. If you can't act, then direct. I've never directed before. I know you'll be good at it. What'll I do? How'd I know? Remember the words of your stage director. 'Use the accident'. Use this accident. But how? Call an ambulance. Huh? But he's dead already. We'll take the ambulance and flee. For real? "4 Days Before Bank Hit" Crap, for real? Darn it! I blew it... As usual, Koji was losing in the VIP room of Casino Vega. Came to lecture me? Like that'll stop you? No way. How much debt? 200. So, twice that? - Busted. - From who? Got a loan here. So a mafia. Sure. Truth is, I really need money, too. - For rent? - I'm dead if I can't pay. What's that? I've a good deal if we can pull it off. - But risky? - Yeah. Possibly die? No, but called by number. - Prison? - If we get caught. - Let me guess. - Okay. - Blackmail? - No. - Theft? - Close. - Robbery? - Bingo. For real? So tell me, you in or out? Come on, you know what I'd say to your deals. A bank hit. - For real? - For real. Bank hits are American culture. It's no culture. Amateurs can't. I've good info. - Valid? - I trust it. - A gamble. - Going back to the casino? I'm broke. You and I have no choice. So anyone else in on this bet? Big Ken. - That baldie? - Yeah, fat baldie Ken. He's too slow, no good. We need Big Ken for this plan. What'll I do? The driver. Huh? I'll hit the bank, too. Make Big Ken drive. No license. So useless. Then you drive. Then you and Big Ken need to hit the bank. - Darn it. - So I'll go with him. You wait with the car running. - That's it? - Yeah. Then what about guns? That's where you come in. Huh? I've got none. Any friends that do? Sure. A kid in my motorbike gang. Have him get us two handguns and a stolen car. Not three? You're only a driver. I'm unarmed? If we get caught, your hands are clean. I'd go help you out. It's more the budget. We can't get three. So uncool without a gun. That's not the point here. Let me do a practice shot. This is no game. Fine, I get it. Koji, if we get that money, we won't be losers anymore. And turn our lives around? Turn it around. Hold on, we can't steal an ambulance! Cops won't stop an ambulance. But how? Threaten them with a gun and tie them up. The rescue workers? Take their uniforms. What about Ogata? - Leave him. - But the rescuers? They'll report to the police. An ambulance is an easy target. Then bring them. What if they resist? Like the old lady you shot at the bank? It was to get away. So you'll shoot as needed? Only oldies would resist with a gun to their heads. Or Jason Bourne. Who's that? Matt Damon in The Bourne Identity series. No film analogies! We'll manage. Let me do it this time. No, you drive. Again? You drive, Shu. No, I've never driven an ambulance. Me neither. Besides, it's a special vehicle. Can I drive it? It's useless if we can't. Civilians drive it when zombies attack. Zombies are in the US and UK, not Japan. Enough with films! What now? Have them drive it. Like they would. Point a gun at them. - And car searches? - We're screwed. Then what? Stop complaining and think! They found us? They would've stormed in. Darn it! - Where to? - Check from the stairs. What if they spot you? "Bar Golden Clock" Hello, gentlemen. "3 Days Before Bank Hit" Hello, gentlemen. "3 Days Before Bank Hit" "3 Days Before Bank Hit" Long time, sir. When was the last? Five years since we had a gathering... Koji's buddy came dressed in a classy brand suit. I had imagined a rough guy but he was more like a first-class lawyer. Stop reminiscing. Get started. Why not? It's been a while. No, you'll start talking about old fights, girls and teachers. My snot is white from chalk. Drop it. It's not funny. I don't know your teacher. No, I mean, Koji... I'm paying, so do as I say. We'll pay you back. You better. Hey, give us an hour. Wakatsuki, is this bar... I own it. I own a few, so come anytime. For real? So cool! With unique concepts. Consent? Why'd you need that? - Not consent. - Right, I said concepts. Don't use English to act cool. It's a widely used term. Why do underground work? I'm an underground handyman. It's more exciting and fulfilling. Let's get started. Two handguns and a car, right? Is it loaded? No. We won't pay extra for them. No, I'm playing it safe until I get paid. You're careful. Don't you trust me? Sorry, it's Granny's teaching. In business, even suspect your life saver. What a brat. Stop, it's a risky business. Precaution is necessary. I left 12 bullets in a coin locker at Kawasaki Station. Thanks. I got you easy-to-handle revolver guns. If you want more power, I recommend a shotgun. It's only for show, so no need for a shotgun. I see. The car's parked across the main gate of Kawasaki Racecourse. They got cameras, so go in a hat and shades. Have the driver go alone. - Koji. - Got it. Oh, you're not going in? So what? I'm glad you have the least risk. It's not like I chickened out. Got you a cool car. Considered its looks? Granny's teaching. Provide service where least expected. Who cares about your granny? Koji. I won't ask what you'll be doing with your purchase but good luck. Thanks. Teamwork is most vital for a successful operation. Is that from you? Granny's teaching. Who the heck is she? A sniper. - What? - On the rooftop. In a SWAT uniform, with a rifle. - Got spotted? - I don't think so. Japan has SWAT teams? - Don't know. - Osaka has an anti-terrorist unit. Anti-terrorist? For real? Anti-ter... Anti-ter... terro... darn it! Stop trying. How long behind bars? We'll get 10 years, but 20 for Shu. I'm not the principal offender. It's your deal, your plan. That doesn't mean... - Geez... - Who is it from? An alarm. - An alarm? - The waiters will come. What'll we do? Tell everyone we're closing due to norovirus. Koji, call. Okay. Anti... ti... Titanic... He said 'Titanic'. His mouth's sinking? Shu is not the principal offender, nor 1. "2 Weeks Before Bank Hit" nor 1. "2 Weeks Before Bank Hit" I've always thought the sanitary box was in a weird place. I tipped it over when I tried to move it. What's this? My instincts told me there were more, so I searched. I was right. I found more in the paper towel dispenser and room deodorant. I called the owner Hama after work to report my findings. I found these in the washroom. I see. I did it. So now... A short drive. Stop it! Peeing in your pants, you loser? Let me out! How dare you mess with my business. Cameras in the washroom is business? Peep shots make big bucks. Double the standard for a nightclub washroom. Plus I cover all the spots the hardcore fans want. Gross. The paper towel dispenser one's aimed at the mirror you all look at. A clean shot of the girls who'll be peeing. The sanitary box one for the low angle. The deodorant one captures your butt. - You're disgusting. - Thanks. Not a compliment. There's one more camera. Behind the nozzle of the bidet. To get the private shot! You got to see the private part! - Jerk. - Thanks. Not a compliment. All right, I'll make you an actress again. Like you can do that. Actress for porn, of course. An ex-actress hostess with that face. You'll make it big for sure. No way. You've no choice, dummy. How much do you think you blew? - Who cares”? - 50 million! No way, you can't make that much! I'll give you two weeks. Pay me 50 million yen in cash. A bank guard owes me. Get a team and plan a bank hit. A bank hit? Yeah, stage a bank hit or you start doing porn. I can't... If you can't act, then direct. I've never directed before. "2 Days Before Bank Hit" That's how Hama ordered me to hit a bank. You're kidding, right? Unfortunately, no. It's all Hama's plan. Why didn't you tell me? So as not to tip Hama off. A bank hit is only a bonus to him. Then why? He wants you in porn. You know Hama so well. We go way back. I'd rather do BB than be in porn. Why won't you run? I won't live in fear. We take the risk and Hama gets all the money. That's too much. It's good. Want to try? Not bad? Too sweet. - Betray Hama. - What? We'll take everything. You and I split the money. You serious? Koji and Big Ken? Frame them, too? - Yeah. - You know Koji's my buddy. We get to split over 100 million yen. No, I can't betray Koji. Fine, three of us then. Okay. But Big Ken... Koji and I will frame him. He's easy enough. But not Hama. - I'll tell Koji. -No, don't. I won't betray Koji! No. I mean, Koji might blow it in front of Hama. I see. The details later then. Wait, you won't even tell me? You'll see Hama today and tomorrow. You won't blow it? How about you? I'm an actress. An ex-actress, right? I'll become an actress again. Then tell me a third of the plan. - What? - I need to be ready. If you fail, he'll stab you with an ice pick. We've no choice. After hitting the bank, hide. Where? Honey Bunny. - I'm done calling. - Me too. Split the money. Worry about the SWAT team now. Why aren't they in here already? Maybe a negotiator is coming. This is no Hollywood film. He's right, Shu. We won't get Schwarzenegger. That's Terminator, not a negotiator. Let's think how to get out. No, I want to split the money now. Big Ken. If we go out and get chased, we may split up, never to meet again. So let's split it now. Even if we do get caught, I want to hold it in my hands once. - But... - Shu, come on, let's split it. Here we go. What's this? What's wrong? It's newspapers! - No money. - How? - For real? - Shu, explain, now! I've no clue either. All our efforts gone to waste! Get it out. Cut the act, fool. It's not me. Just get it out! I said let's split it. I opened the bag, too. Why would I do that if I did it? Why me? We won't do it! 'We'? I see... What? Shu and I won't do it. You and Shu trick me and take 90% of the money. So no need to do it, huh? What's that? People think you're gay, so it's possible. So what? - Koji. - It's fine. He found out. You hid the money so we won't get 90%. One of you might take all. No way! Calm down. Boy, Shu, why are you so calm? Impressive, unlike stupid Koji. -You're dead. - Of course, you're upset. The money's gone. It's normal! Stop that nonsense! I'm about to panic! The unexpected happened! So what? If you can remain calm, either you're a real man or... You knew all along there was no money in the bag! Right, Shu? What do you mean? You're saying that Shu did it? He's way too calm. Shu won't betray me. Still trusting him? Did he really do you? -You... - Or do you do him? - I'll kill you... - Don't... - I'll kill you... - I said, don't! Before you do, answer this. Who prepared this bag? Swapping money takes time. I bet he got two bags and swapped them. So who got this bag? You, right? Koji, listen to me. Shu... If you didn't, explain it to me. You said to hide here. Why Honey Bunny? Because cops were after us. This was the only deserted place we know well. You're working with someone else. You're meeting up here. For real? Trust me. There is no trust between us. Hey, is it for real, Shu? I won't betray you. It was you who brought up this bank hit. Shu, you betrayed me? I won't betray you. Then why hesitate when I said to split the money? Koji... "1 Day Before Bank Hit" What's the most savoring food in this world? Lightly grilled cod roe? You're satisfied with that? Shibugaki's guys snatched me outside Honey Bunny. Once again, what's the most savoring food in this world? - Carbonara? - Fool! Sorry, madam. It's brain. I first had a fried lamb brain in Morocco. It was so good, I got hooked on it. A veal brain meuniere in France, a mutton brain curry in India. The best is monkey brain. Strap down a live monkey at a table, carefully cut off the skull with a saw and expose its brain. Sprinkle Chinese wine and dig in with a spoon. With baby monkeys, drill a hole and suck it up like milk shake. You stink! You had cod roe and carbonara! It's now a cod roe carbonara! How disgusting! But this room's great. You can water anything down, even blood. Please forgive me. Forgive? About what? No, I... You had no plans of paying back? No, I... You bought matching Boston bags with Maria at Lazona. How? I research my clients thoroughly. I know you bought guns and a car with Kojima and Kanamori Ken. That we're... Hitting a bank? -Ye... Yes. - I'll help you. No, thank you, madam. We can handle it ourselves. A fresh brain is a mix of blowfish roe and cream cheese. Maria... Lemme speak with Maria! No, don't tell Maria about me! You mean, betray her? You're being betrayed. What? - She's a real liar. - Why? She's an actress, a pro at acting. I trust her. Because she's a beauty. Would you still trust her if she were an old fart? It's proof you're in her trap. That can't be! Really? Then you just trust her. - Dinner time. - Please wait! What? - Help us! - Louder. - Please help! - Louder. - Please help us! - Too late! I'm sorry! Please help us! Please help me! Please help! No, don't! Stop! Brain matter stings real bad. I beg you! Please don't kill me! A lawyer kept begging for his life even after a third of his brain was gone. Using words was his forte, but he sounded like a toddler. He made his living with his brain, so it was so juicy. Please stop! I beg you! Will you obey me? Yes, I will. You'll prove your loyalty? Anything! I will do anything! I'll have him darn you in the butt! No. After you finish up... I'll help you rob the bank. Please! Listen up. Don't be fooled by that woman. Use your head. Who was it that brought you here to me? Ow! That fucking hurts! Maria, she cornered me to borrow from Shibugaki and hit a bank? Teaming up with Hama to take everything? Why was she at the racetracks? Was she tailing me to look for a chance? Did she steal the bag? Interesting... Wait and see. Maria, I'll get the jump on you. My asshole's been split wide open. How dare you use your obedient gay buddy. Koji, we can't talk like this, really. Really? What's real here? Think about it. Why would I swap? To get the money. We were going to split it. You'd find out. That's too risky for me. But... Do you really think I would betray you? Koji, don't listen. You got kicked out of your place, so I took you in for three months. Did I ever... take money from you? Deep down, you despised him! I fed you, too. Shoot his leg, Koji. I--- I won't betray you. Get away from Koji! Shu... What'll happen to us? That was close! Shu... You're real scum. You're quite sharp, Big Ken. You hid the money? - Bingo. - Shu... For real. - Killing us? - Most probably. Shu! The money? - Maria has it. - Maria? What do you mean? "1 Day Before Bank Hit" Let me explain again. No, I've questions. Call me three hours before the hit. Don't tip Maria off. Of course. I'll play along with Maria's plan, but outdo her. Ouch... Wha... what's wrong? It's nothing. Okay. Then ask as we go. It's more efficient that way. All right. First, Koji drives you to the bank. Koji stays in the running car. We enter the bank at 2:45? Yeah, 15 min. Before they close. I'll be standing at the counter. If you're at the bank, it'll blow the plan. - In disguise. - As what? A granny. Not good enough. A stage director I hated cast me as a granny once. This is no stage. Not a perfect granny, but no one will pay me attention. Big Ken will notice. Have him point a gun at the guard. Only a grandpa guard there. Don't move! He'll be too preoccupied. And the rest? - On the floor. - I see. Hands up! On the floor! They'll unlock their safe for the security vehicle that day. Next, tell a banker... Bring the money! Then have me pack them. - Hold it. - Again? Who'll bring the swap bag? - Me. - Unnatural. A granny with a Boston bag? Besides, a matching bag with the robber? I'll use a shopping cart, like other grannies. You'll swap it with the newspaper-filled bag, so practice. After the swap, you'll kill me. Fake it, of course. I'll get some gore. You fire a blank. How will you escape? And the money? Hama will arrange an ambulance. Why would it come so soon? You want the cops? It seems forced. People will be in a panic anyway. Then just drive to Honey Bunny. Yes! We did it! Go, Koji! Will it really work? You know, I used to do long jump in high school. You know the tip to jump far? No, I was never the athletic type. To believe you can. What? A mental tip? You practice hard, but your heart determines the distance. It may be an overused line but believe in yourself. That's difficult. I've been betraying myself. I won't lose. I'll make this work, go to the US and take lessons for Broadway. An actress? Yeah. Well I... I once aspired to become a film director. - You did? - But not for long. Once you run away, nothing lasts for long. And now a gamble-addict manager. I think you got something special. - Like what? - Something. I'm here because I got nothing. I don't know what. But you've got it. I'm sure you can jump far, Shu. We're Clarence and Alabama of True Romance. I like Christian Slater in True Romance. Yeah. I think he's good, but why isn't he big in Japan? He's in Murder In The First and Interview With The Vampire. Not a face the Japanese like? He's not as hot as Brad Pitt or Johnny Depp. Nor does he have an edge like Sean Penn or Gary Oldman. Maybe a real actor needs to go bald, get fat or lose teeth? Shu, what's your favorite Christian Slater film? 'Who is Cletis Tout?' That's a hidden masterpiece. With a film loving hitman. I watched it three times. Aren't we doing it? I value the mood. You do? I better get going. So, when we get to Honey Bunny, will you really be there? - Doubting me? - Just checking. As I said, I'll be watching with Hama. From where? Hama won't tell me. You let me know. Why are you so insistent? Is it necessary? If anything happens, I'll go get you. Thanks. But about Koji... Koji is... I'll kill Hama, too. Fine. Really? We've no choice. "Right After Bank Hit" Okay, a short drive now. I'm a hands-on guy, especially with big deals. That was Maria? Quite an act, right? Then that blood? Fake. I was killed by Shu. That was the plan. Stop blabbing your plan, you drama queen. We're watching from an upper floor, once a nightclub. Hama bought it and the bar downstairs after they closed down. Killing me? Sorry, it can't be helped. Just Kill them! Then Shu'd get arrested. And the money will be ours. Liar! If the police searches, his peeping film business will be busted. Hama's going to kill everyone, including me. No way! I'll kill him first! In this bag is your favorite ice pick. Sorry Shu, I'll kill you, too. And the money... All mine. Hey, don't ignore me. I was concentrating. I'm the type who likes to chat when watching films. Really? You watch films? Hey, you making fun of me? - No. - Films aren't just for you. I never said that. Self-claimed film lovers like Shu and you don't think others have an eye for films. When you haven't even taken a minute or second of a film! Yet talk about the camera work, music and actors. And never listen to others' film reviews. Listen, I do watch films, two a year. My favorite is Back To The Future. I hate those who say, 'It's a fun film, but isn't it too typical?' Look at them! It's a great documentary film. As always? I only record usually, but arranged six monitors to entertain you today, madam. Why madam-ing me? I loaded only one bullet just now. You'd still have Big Ken. If it's just him, I can handle it. But I can move. Will one bullet do? Koji, he's so cool, man. Better aim carefully, Shu. Sorry, Koji. For real? Awesome! Amazing, Koji. Get me a rope or something. There's no need. What's that? Adding a new twist? - For real? - Don't move! I've got five bullets. - For real? - Enough with your 'For real? It's usually 'for real', so quit it. Stay back! I saw what you can do. That gun... I went to the bar to get a gun, not hide one! But when? - Last night. - Why? I thought you two would frame me. You two are close like a couple. But thought there's more when the money wasn't there. So kept my trump card till last. A type that keeps the best for last. That's... He'll kill Shu and Koji. No change in our plan. That's right. I'll just kill Hama and Big Ken. Just a change in order. Where's Maria? She has the money? I don't know. She was supposed to call, but hasn't. Give it. Not checking? You handing it means, she hasn't called or you erased the log. He's good at calculating. He sure is a Naniwa merchant. Get your greasy hand off my leg! And the money? Kill me and Maria won't show. Who knows? Maria might be nearby. Huh? What's he saying? You were right. Killing one is same as two. Please don't shoot. So miserable, Shu, begging for your life. Goodbye now. Hey, I missed the good part. How? By touching your body, I can tell when you'll attack from muscle movement. You said you did long jump? Your thigh muscle was ready to Kill. That's how? I can't trust smart chicks. Brace yourself. Do me with my favorite ice pick? Forget style in killing! I'm using it because it's handy. Not only to Kill, but to threaten. And for light torture, too. Plus I can carve ice for on the rocks, you know? That's true. I should've blown your head off. I thought of the ice for a toast. Where should I stab first? The thigh is too typical. Maybe your nipples? Did you know? If you slice off a nipple, a small one grows back. Interesting, right? Let me tell you. What? Your mouth smells like sewer. Thanks. Not a compliment. I got it. I'll flip your eyeballs like octopus balls. How about Big Ken? The cops are outside. He can't move. Your peeping business? You removed the cameras for me. It's no surprise to have cameras in clubs these days. You can't be in porn if I do your eyes. Your arms then. I'll break them both. - Wait. - Not a chance. Big Ken's gone! Where'd he go? That outfit! He'll escape in that. - Cut the power? - He knew about us? - You told him? - No way! He left the club! You going? Hurry up! Taking the money? It's full of cops outside. You're coming, too! Darn it... The stairs? There's a sniper. They won't shoot. They might see us, you fool! What's the rush? You were... Things have changed. He knew about us peeping. So the power? He had a cop uniform ready, too. Which means, he knew he was coming here after the bank hit. There's a breach or he's working for someone. I must Kill him before the cops get him. Give me your arm. What? For show. A cop! No, that's him. If it's a cop, why'd he speed away? How will we find him? Catch him on the way to his expensive apartment and Kill him. If not, kidnap his family. Then kill him. That's crazy! He's going to hell. What took you so long? I've been waiting. Ms. Shibugalki. How've you been? Why? Long time no see. A nice ride you've got here. Sorry, madam, I don't have time for a chat. You think I care about your schedule? I'd welcome you if you make an appointment. But unfortunately, I'm fully booked today. You're putting on a tough act, but terrified inside. I did nothing to fear you. Sticking your chest out to prove your manhood? Thanks to my gym, I'm developing muscles, so naturally my chest sticks out. Don't act all that, you brat! I've popped out eight kids. When you're a lesbo? That's only recently. How amazing you can change your sexuality at your age. Right? It's said men will die if they were to give birth. But I've done that eight times. The scenes you've been through are nothing compared to that! What's your point? Wanna try it? What do you mean? The average weight of an infant is 3 kg. I'll cut your stomach open and put a bowling ball in it. A crash pregnancy experience. That's enough, you hag! You'll fight me with that toy? You've always been a drag, you crone! Too bad, you could've become the Emperor of Kawasaki in time. Sure. I was going to show you your place soon, but a change in plan. Boy. Here's your last chance. Give me the right to Honey Bunny. Including the peeping film business, of course. You'll have to clean up three dead bodies, though. There are no dead bodies. I saw it with my eyes. Don't believe everything you see. It'll come back to bite you, boy. No way... I guess you're sharper than him, girl. What did you get us into? "3 Hours Before Bank Hit" What did you get us into? "3 Hours Before Bank Hit" "3 Hours Before Bank Hit" I told the two everything on our last scouting. "3 Hours Before Bank Hit" I needed their help to frame Hama and Maria. I needed their help to frame Hama and Maria. So he filmed me taking a dump? Only the girl's washroom. I'm supposed to kill you two. - For real? - Hama's a perfectionist. Maria and I would be... Killed and Hama gets the money. There are in-store cameras, too. Show the girls working first, then them peeing. A real perfectionist. They recorded the video when I was working and taking a dump? Shut it now. Koji, who'd want to see you taking a dump? Don't answer him. How'd you find out? I've been there long. Me too, but never noticed. He'll monitor us. From? They need to be close to receiving the signal. As the manager, I knew Hama bought the floor above us. I went and found the monitors. They'll be there? -Yes. - We must act in order to survive? Here's my plan. Sounds like a grand plan. I got two helpers. - Who? - One's Ogata. The waiter? He's in debt from mahjong. He'll do anything for 10 million. You're all gamble addicts. Thank you, sir. I'm sorry. I'm fine. - You queer? - No. -You sure? -Yes. -You in? - Yes, sir. Ogata will wait in the bar. Big Ken, you 'kill' him. You're making me nervous. I also bought another gun from Wakatsuki. Loaded with blanks. 'Kill' Koji and me with this. You... I also got a cop uniform. Change in the washroom and cut the power... Wait... Hold it. So much to do? I can't remember. It's that or death. - So complicated. - Hama will run out. And then what? Get the money. He won't leave it. He will, with the cops around. How? Wakatsuki will get us a cop car. Not even he can get one. A paint job and siren will do. Guess it'll look like one. Paying him too? He got us the blanks and the uniform. - How much? - 10 million upon success. No need to pay that jerk. I'll go out at the siren and claim there's a sniper. Like in comics? Use 'anti-terrorist unit' to add reality. Anti-terro... a tongue twister. You'll mess up. - I won't. - Try it. Anti-terro... Anti-terrorist unit. - Anti... - Anti-terrorist unit. Anti-terro... Koji, if you can't say it now, forget it. So strict. Once the light's out, Ogata will drive away in a cop uniform. Hama will mistake him as you and run after him. Wow, perfect. What if Ogata gets caught? That's right. He'll never get caught. Why not? Please corner Hama. What's in it for me? Rights to Honey Bunny. Not bad. Fight fire with fire. Shibugaki versus Hama? Alien versus Predator. Forget films. Freddy versus Jason. - Enough! - Shut up. Sorry. They did it... Be a man. Admit your loss. It's not over. Just give it up. I'll look down at you next time. Sure, I dare you to. Let's get back to Honey Bunny. Huh? We'll go get the money. But Shu and them must have escaped. No, they can't escape. Found it! - Big Ken! - Okay... Hama really left it. As you said. Yeah. Back to Honey Bunny. What's this? I told you there's a shotgun I recommend. I got the blanks for you. Big Ken! What the... All right, looking great. How dare you betray us, Wakatsuki! Don't yell at me, sir. I didn't betray you. This was all in the plan. Granny! Granny? What's going on? Remember, I have eight Kids. I got the money. A nice load of cash. A great grandson, right? Here, take it. Cool, thanks. Use it wisely. I will. So, what about them? Boil them? Grill them? Isn't the money and the club enough? You tried to frame and kill them. Don't you lecture me. Listen, they got big bucks taken away by me. Ouch. I'm going to pull their fangs out. So they won't bite back. I won't dare bite you. Ouch. Can you promise? I will. I have a wife and kid. Please don't kill me! You love them? Of course I love them. Fine. Then I'll give all this money to your family. What? I boiled water. Great, you read my mind. Please wait. Pouring it? Idiot, I won't do something you'd see on a cheap TV show. Then? That hurts... You drink it to the last drop. But that's... I'll give your family the money if you do. I can't. You love them? I can't! It's not your call. I decide whether you can! Please, no! Please stop! Stop it! Now! Ouch! What are you doing? So cool. Please calm down, sir. Wakatsuki, Kill me if you want! You're still so passionate and compassionate. So annoying. Shut up, you granny's boy. I never thought your granny was this monster. Don't call her a monster! Granny this, Granny that. How old are you? Go suck her shriveled boob and choke to death. Why you? What's that? About time... Shu, good work. What're you saying? What did you guys do? Five. - Four. - What? Three. Two. One. Zero... Nothing? I guess not so perfect as planned. So close! I wished it went off on 'Zero'. - You set fire? - It's your doing? Where? Guess where. So? Will you burn to death? Granny! She's not as young as she looks. Shut up! Your grandma would be the first to go. Darn! Get Granny onto the elevator. The elevator? You sure? It'll stop in the fire! The stairs? Back of the kitchen. What'll you do? You worried? A bit. Let's go! You're Granny's favorite! - Wakatsuki! - What? If you lie, you get lied to. What? My granny's words. Go kill them. They'll die in the fire. If they escape, it'll ruin my reputation. Fine, you go down. Take Maria. She might become a hostage. Come! Why? They're gone! Why? The elevator's moving. Why? They're using it. The rooftop! - Come. -No! - Come, now! - No! Not here? Darn it! Come on! They're going down. - Why? - They framed us. It's not moving! Darn! Ouch! What a loser. Oh no, we can't go down. What'll we do? Wow, so spacious! "1 Hour Before Bank Hit" "1 Hour Before Bank Hit" Geez, it's huge! Geez, it's huge! Let's come here after Honey Bunny. Why rent here when you can't pay? Shut it. This is serious. A dryer and hairspray when you're bald. I've every right to! Guys, focus! Right... so? We change here, drive to Fukuoka then off to Korea. And play with Korean girls' boobs. Forget boobs until we escape. That's beside the point. Yell at him now. Gosh. My head is sensitive. Get off me. But we can't use the same car. Wakatsuki got us a new one. He better earn his share. A van so we'll have space. Then can we pick up my wife and Kid in Osaka? - They should fit. - Thanks. -You know? - What is it? - He still pisses me off. - Who? Wakatsuki, that attitude. You brought him in. He was in your gang? He changed. I mean, he was smart, but... He better be, in his business. No, precisely that. Gun and stuff, sure, but helping us escape? Your point? He can sell us stuff but showing up at the scene? Then why so cooperative? Is he going to betray us? You can't trust him. Maybe he sold us out? Maybe... I know you bought guns and a car with Kojima and Kanamori Ken. Hitting a bank? That's why she knew everything. She who? Talk to us. Tamiko Shibugaki. - That hag? - Just a hunch. That's a horrible hunch. She'll take the money. What now? Better run now? No, we need a plan to outdo Shibugaki and Wakatsuki. Fool, that's suicidal. They're so confident. That's our chance. - No way. - We're on the edge. We can't win without a risk. This is our chance to reset our lives. Let's win and take back what we lost. You'll really do it? Your heart determines the distance. A tip in jump long. Shu, I believe in you. What's this? A teenage drama? It's no sport, it's a bank hit. Big Ken... I know, I've no choice. We must do it. Thank you. But I haven't trusted you completely. - It depends on your plan. - Sure. When will he betray us? Probably when we leave the building. After we do all the work? Drag us back to Honey Bunny. - Then? - Expect some violence. How can we turn it around? Hold on. So here's my plan. No, that's him. Found it! - Big Ken! - Okay... Okay. - Ready. - Let's go. We'll split the money into two at Honey Bunny. Why the trouble? Put one-third of it with newspaper money. A decoy? The remaining two-thirds? In the washroom. Koji. Hurry. Big Ken! A nice load of cash. A great grandson. - Please stop! - Move! Hey you! You? Five. - Four. - What? Three. Two. One. Zero... Nothing? Don't let them use the elevator. The elevator? It'll stop in the fire! Lead them to the stairs? And we escape. Not yet. What if we're tied up? The knife we used on Ogata. The elevator's moving. - Why? - They're using it. The rooftop! We'll get the money and escape. - Come! -No! We can't go down. They're going down. - Why? - They framed us. We're only giving them one-third and newspapers. Perfect. It's show time. - Let's do it. - We'll beat them. - I'll bet on you. - Let's outdo them all. - Let's go. - Yeah. It's no sport meet. Don't you need to go? Shut it. It's a fire. In my club's direction. Is that hag all right? Did someone iron your hair? Shut up! I'm back! What'll we do? I'll jump. I can't do that. Stop whining! I'm jumping. Why should I do this? Darn it... I'm jumping. I won't die here. My heart determines the distance. You out of your mind? Hey, don't do it! We made it. We did it, Shu! Not yet. Why not? You're mine. - For real? - Monster. Just give it up. No, we're not good at giving up. I did it! Don't go! Fool! No... There's another one like us. You're all mine. Stay back! There! Him, too? Okay, Ogata. Say hi to your grandson! Bye then! I'll track you down to hell! Maria? Maria! Granny! Granny? You? You... I told you, I'll look down at you. They really busted the place. Cheers... How is it? Great! Chateau Herpes. Not Herpes, it's Petrus. We really did it. We did. Now time for boobs... Get over it. We must get out of here first. That's enough. We're safe. Until Ogata disposes the car. We're fine, Shu. Shu, you did well. Relax now. Shu, a toast. Well... all right! Another toast! To our freedom and victory! Cheers... - So good! - I want boobs! Fine, touch mine. - I will. -You? - Nipple. - Just my nipple? Hey, what is it? Geez, the door was unlocked. A freebie for robbers. - For real? - Why? Come on, say, 'We're the robber!' Ogata... I bumped into him, so brought him. - Spare us! - No, calm down... How much did you get? 110 million yen. So 160 million yen for the two bags? Yes. How were you going to spend it? Old man. You? Please don't kill me. Answer my question. Restart with my family in Osaka. And go to nightclubs again? I now know what's important. I'll live for my family from now. Koji, for gamble? No, I quit. Then what? Don't know, but want to do business with Shu. You two really together? Maria? My heart's all set. I'd get the money and go to Broadway to be in American musicals. An actress? Shu, sorry I lied. I lied, too. Put Clarence and Alabama on hold. We're nobodies. Shu, what about you? Shu. We put our lives on the line to get this money. Sure. I planned so hard to get this money to start anew. Sure. Please spare us. All right. What? You split the money. That's... I just took out Shibugaki. I'm feeling great. - You serious? -I am. Thanks to you burning that building, I'll get three floors worth of fire insurance. I'll buy that burnt down building and build a new one. Use that as base to take over Kawasaki. We can take the money? Take it. But... You work for me now. What do you mean? Work at a club again? No, listen. Shibugaki had eight kids and twenty or so grandkids. I must fight them off now. Yo... you mean... We fight that monster family? We can't. Yes, you can. You outdid me and that hag. We were desperate. Koji... You're good at fighting. Be my bodyguard. Old man, you've got good negotiation skills. Maria, the actress. You're a great liar. How about me? - Errand boy. - Thank you. That leaves Shu. Shu, the plot you come up with is interesting as before. Your plot is interesting. Thank you. Hilarious! I can't. We were a bunch of losers. We wanted to get out. Big Ken to protect his family. Koji to find something. Maria for her dream. And I to reset my crappy life. It was a once-in-a-lifetime gamble. This is our reset button. To lead a slightly better life... Fool! You're mere bank robbers. Stop being dramatic. No way can you lead a normal life. Listen, you are... Rotten. Granny. Granny! Open your eyes! Don't die, Granny! Please don't die! Granny, don't... Granny?
