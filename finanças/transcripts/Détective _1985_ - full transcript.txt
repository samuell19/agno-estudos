Because love is eternal. You think that's why those two haven't budged all morning? Personally, I was interested more in that one, Uncle. Yes, that one. Look. She comes. She goes. She even seems to hesitate. Yes, she's hesitating. She's hesitating. She looks more like she's scared. Maybe. Any second, a catastrophe could happen. Enough of this. Arielle, I'm off to work. In our psychology class, we were told that a catastrophe was... the first strophe of a love poem. Cut that out! - I'm going to work. - No, I told you, I'll find out on my own. Enough of this, Uncle! You've been here two years, and I've been paying your hotel bill. One night, two years ago, someone walked into this room, pulled a gun, and shot. And the prince died. Without reason. It's true. The prince had no enemies. Everybody liked him. The case was closed. I've been a detective in this hotel for 15 years. I got fired. So I'll find out who killed the prince. Do you have anything to write with? My wife might call. Tell her I had to go to Frankfurt... and that I'll be back tomorrow morning. But your wife is here, sir. In the lobby, behind you. Remit this to Mr. Warner, Room 473. What's going on? Why did you come? So... - Did you see Mr. Warner? - No, I have to fly to Frankfurt. Paul called in sick, I have to replace him. You didn't see him? No. I left him a message. He's probably tied up with his match. I hope that's not him. Why are you here? Françoise? Because it's our last deal. And in a way, our first one. I have to take care of it too. I need self-respect now. I must learn. So, you're leaving? I must learn. I must learn. So, you're leaving? No, I'm not leaving. Don't start again. I'll be back tomorrow. You see... we said we'd take the time to talk things over. Try to say what we dare not say. But you're leaving. No, I'm not leaving. Stop it. Yes, I'm leaving, but Paul is sick. I have to sub for him. It's not the first time. Talk things over... We can do that tomorrow. I guess. - I'll see you tomorrow. - I hope. And if I see him? You'll tell me all about it. You'll tell me everything. Almost everything. Can you leave me a little money? And this one, what's he up to? It's true. All French people look like nuts, once you start paying attention. You think the murderer will be back? Everything keeps starting over. History stammers... Listen, I get three days off. The department has agreed to it. I'm gonna nose around. It's true. I smell death in this hotel. I think it's a first-class hotel. Not in the city. It's become a second-class city. Why would anyone come in the room to kill the prince for no reason? Right, it's too easy. That's why I can't figure it out. See you later. Be nice with her. She's 18. Be nice with him. He's 50. DETECTIVE Stop, goddamn it! I told you not to obey his orders. Keep on acting like this, and you won't last five rounds. Go to bed. I gotta call Max. Hey boss. Will you come say good night? Yeah, sure. I'll come back to turn the lights off. Tiger Jones, I'll knock him out. You're abandoning those who helped you? This country is about free enterprise. You have read France-Soir, I presume? Not yet. Why? With the match coming up, I haven't got time. I know. Show him, Angelo. Yes, Prince. - What about our money? - I know I'm late, but Max will help me out. No one ever leaves his family. No one. THE BOXING PROMOTER HAD STOLEN 40 MILLION Wow. No one. A poet once tried. He stopped writing. With the interest, it adds up to 542,734.68 francs. What about this third payment? Just because we die doesn't mean we have to rush. So, the third payment? It'll wait till Saturday. Well, there's the match. It won't be rigged? No way. Give him until Friday. Good luck. ...that we recognize the misdeed. And that we'd spring back with renewed energy. Is it transparent enough? Stop teasing me. What about this? Is it transparent enough? Depends if you want to show the truth. What is the truth? What is the truth? It's between appearing and disappearing. It's showing through? Is this better? Stop teasing me! Is this better? I'm taking a shower. Did you see this? "Villemain died alone." "Considered a boxing legend during the post-war golden age," "died September 4, at Montfermeil, alone, as he had wished." "He was an excellent stylist, and had beaten LaMotta in 1949." Stop it! What's up, kids? Not in bed yet? Tomorrow, jogging at 9:00 am. Press conference at 11:00 am. TV broadcast at 12:30 pm. 5:00 pm, training at the gym. Tiger Jones, I'll knock him out. Isn't that Tiger Jones? Mr. Warner, if I were you, I wouldn't do that. I'd play it off three sides. Don't bust your ass. I want to be alone. And you don't excite me. Told you so. We met once before. Françoise Chenal. Between Lyon and Toulouse. Yes, I remember. I'm tired. Your husband has left for Frankfurt? - He'll be back tomorrow. - See you tomorrow then. Bye, ma'am. Why won't you give Emile his money back? I told you already. Not tonight. Give it to me then. That money is mine. Money belongs to no one. Miss. Just like people. Comes and goes. Make sure you don't lose it. Somebody's gotta say it! Why do you refuse? Put that there. Of course, Mr. Fox. Because... I don't have it. Your name is not Warner? My father's name. I added my mother's. I'm tired. A woman who's owed money. There might be something in it for me. I thought your airline shuttle business was thriving. DEATH Seemed like it, anyway. ALAS LAUGH DANCE - Three years ago, we had five jets. - Classical, please. Classical! Now, there are only two and a half. Two and a half? Absolutely. We started working in pools with another airline. In fact, it has nothing to do with it. Emile and I are getting separated. What you owe him is my share. So I can leave. So I hope. - Where you heading? - I'll see. I want to buy a bookstore. I'll see. You'll never pay us back these 40 million, right? I didn't say that. We'll see Saturday. You still have the money? I didn't say that either. Saturday. Even if I have it, I owe it someplace else. Too loud! To whom? Classical, please. Classical! Got it. What do you know about it? What do you know about it? That women are worthier than men? They ask questions, rather than wanting answers. It takes time. And time is money. To whom? - People you don't know. - I want to know who. You don't know them, and it's better that way. - Please. - No. It's easy not to pay back your husband. With these guys, it's another story. Now, there's you. Maybe it's a game changer. What? You have a solution? What are you thinking of? The payments. What about the payments? It rhymes with impairment. That's not going to happen. Soon as my husband returns, we're coming after you. See you tomorrow. Easy. Easy... as... As... "You would rise, first tempest of the world, and chase them ahead, such as dust." "Because great cities, my Lord, are cursed." "Great cities are nothing but fake." "And their silence is a lie." "And their noises are deceitful." Isidore! "Blessed are the winds fleeing towards the gardens." "For gardens were made for kings who amused themselves briefly" "with young women, intertwining flowers" "to the illustrious tone of their laughter." Let's leave this place, Mr. Jones. Princess, you know I can't. I'll sell my jewelry. Champion of Europe is worth big money. The matches are rigged. It's a lost cause. It's a lost cause. Not our love. Perhaps. But I can't do that. Mr. Jim. To me, it's better than... I don't know. I'll steal. I'll prostitute myself. You will lack of nothing. There's that guy again. We have to tell the others. Isidore! "And the rustling silk of their morning gowns" "murmured like a stream on the gravel path." Yesterday, Frankfurt. This morning, London. When will we talk to him? When will we talk? I do have to earn the money that we spend. Speaking of which, I need some. So I can at least enjoy Paris. So I can at least enjoy Paris. Let's retrieve the money from where it is. That was the plan. We agree, Françoise. Nothing has changed. Anyway, we'll see him tonight, right? - Reserve a table. - I told you what he said last night. I'll see you tonight, and tell him what I told you. Oh, stop it! You're not going to kill anyone. Except me. At the end. Maybe. I'm tired. You're sick. It's not loaded. See you tonight. That's really all you have to say? If we have these 40 million, what's the use of making all these trips? Retrieving the money won't be so easy. I know. And we're finding out just now. See you tonight. I get it. You said it 20 times, since this morning! The first time around, that's all I could come up with. You too. Me too. You're right. We said it at the same time. I remember. We were thrifty. - Can I make up the room? - Yes. Mr. Chenal. - We have to talk. - I don't want to talk. About Sicily. - Bad timing. I'm off to London. - Leave me some money. You don't get it. Sicily as a metaphor. Uncle William? Arielle? What's wrong? What's the matter? What's the matter? Hey, Uncle! Arielle? Come on. There's work to do. What's going on? He fondled you. Is that it? Yes. But much gentler than you. - That's why I'm crying. - Oh, shit. You don't want to get married anymore? You're the one who wanted us to do an investigation. It was to be with you. I'd rather... I'd rather go home. Finish my exams. You're too harsh. The situation is harsh. Not me. Finding the truth. Who, what, why, how? Truth shall be explosive, fixed, or it shall not be. Easy as ABC. We'll make it even easier. Let me summarize. There are plenty of stories here. About people and about us. I'm sure something is going to happen! I ran into old Luciano, in the hotel. In the hotel? And that airline pilot. I'm sure, just by watching him, that he's going to... - Fly? - Fly in our face! Whose face? We'll see. See... Foresee. See what's in here... to find out what's elsewhere. That's gonna help you, Uncle. You have to run as fast as you can to stay in the same place. That's what people do. But to go elsewhere, you have to run twice as fast. That's what we'll do. Gotta make a call. See you tonight. I don't know what's wrong, boss. The machine says it doesn't feel like telling us. What about flowers, Eugene? Do we like them? What's the matter? I wrecked the Mercedes. Tell Eugene we'll use the BMW. Move it! I'll be right there. - Tiger Jones, I'll knock him out! - I know, I know. Hello? Yes. Fine with me. Late afternoon. There's something for you at the front desk. See you later. - What's up this time? - I have lost the "doh" of my clarinet. Get me an envelope. Yes, Master Jim. The legs on those Italians! Where's Angelo, that nitwit? He was with a woman, walking out of a room. - A room maid? - I don't know, Uncle. Sorry to bother you, Prince. Read this, Angelo. Page 60. "Because mafia still means ancient lifestyle, "based on work and effort," "without which existence is meaningless," "the mafia, in recent times, had to make itself less visible," "more public order than in the past." The hair of a sorceress to be. "It's not the police, but the mafia that needs peace" "to run its big business deals," "and it can only prosper in a world it controls." Sorry to bother you, Prince. Today's Thursday. What's the deal with our friend Fox? I'm not certain, but he seems to have direct access to the fight's receipts. I hate to be vulgar, but you're screwing up big time, Angelo. I apologize, Prince. I started with the others, nosed right and left. Left, right. Only the middle matters! You should know better, since our deal with Fiat. Ask some questions. Hundreds of questions. Until you get no for an answer. Yes, Prince. I started with the pilot and his wife. This little Frenchwoman, who looks like a fake Botticelli? You're harsh, Prince. In my opinion, she's quite charming. I'd screw her happily. You mean gladly? I'm sorry. No. Not me. The situation is harsh. I thought of this. "The apes preached the new order." "The reign of peace." "And among the first enthusiasts were the tiger, the cat, the kite." "Little by little, all animals were converted." "And then, there was quiet rejoicing." What's in it for him anyway? Isidore? Yes, Isidore. Isidore. Glory. I'd rather stay alone. You two getting married? I have to finish my exams first. Anyway, I thank you. And you? Me? What am I looking for? Ah, the bosom of young girls. The money of men. Unreality, reconciliation, acceptation... ...after death... ...it's Shakespeare.. So? Impossible, boss. They won't allow us in the gym. But they'll get their check on Sunday! No money, no training. They want cash. Your right, your right! Your left now. Bretonel would have never done this to us. So it goes, Eugene. Pity. Your right, your right, I said! Try the Farnechon brothers. You got it, Mr. Jim! And your right. Your right. Reach. Break. Learn how to break, for Christ's sake! That's it! Throw your left. Your left. You can do better. That's better. What's wrong? Why did you say that's right about his left? There's a lady. There's a lady. Did he say, a lady? He meant a tramp! Come in. Come in. We're through. We're through! What's going on? Can I have some chocolate? Boss? Okay, but no television. A man's body is a beautiful thing. You think you're handsome? And we'll all win. I hope so. A man's body. You have to learn to break, my boy. To break. That's the secret. Not to brake, but to break. Break. Bad break. Don't worry, Mr. Jim. Tiger Jones, I'll knock him out. Isn't he Tiger Jones? Yeah. But a champion is always fighting against himself. We're on tomorrow morning at the Farnechon brothers'. 9:00 sharp then. Is the Mercedes fixed? Cyrille, the Mercedes? Done. So sell the BMW. Give Victor a call. What time is dinner? As soon as my husband gets here. Within the next couple of hours. Why did you want us to meet before? No, not meet. Meet again. I'm sorry about yesterday afternoon. Yesterday afternoon... I tried. You threw me out. Plus, you owe me money. Why this change of stance all of a sudden? We had all our time. And you're the one saying... No, forget it. I'd like to think it over... before answering. - What do you mean, think it over? - I told you I was sorry! - Hi. - Hello. That's all I could find. "Betrayal opens its eyes, plans its coup." "If you long for life, shake off your sleep and be on your guard." "Awaken, awaken!" "Antonio, let's bring things to a head." Why are porn films called "X"? Why "X"? X is mathematics. Precisely. Of course. The unknown. Last night I didn't feel like talking. Or maybe I did. But I was too tired. Thanks for the 1,500 francs, by the way. Emile didn't leave me a penny. I bought myself a dress. And last night... You didn't have the same impact on me as you did four months ago. Three months. Feels strange to have a woman asking me for money. With men, I'm used to it. I owe to all of them. All the time. Every day. Never stops. What we did on the plane, before it landed in Toulouse... had you done it before? With other passengers? On occasion. Your husband knows about it? Of course not. You know Emile? I did, seven or eight years ago. He has to score as many points as possible for him to keep his European title. It's not over yet, of course. What's the deal he's got going with you? He's entitled to part of the match's earnings? He gets 100 percent of four percent, and you get 100 percent of four percent of Tiger Jones's body. Of everything he does or will do. Advertising, video dips, radio. Up to 40 million. I've got 51 percent, and the others get the rest. It's a difficult ending. I don't understand a thing. What about the boxer? None of your business. With your husband... There were also deals. Involving shipments. Border crossings. What stories? I thought it over. You want me to tell you the truth? Why did I want us to meet? A little. Alone. Before dinner. That we meet again. I'm so broke right now, I can't even afford prostitutes. They should be all over the place. After all, it's a European championship. But that fool fell in love with a princess from the Bahamas. I have to ask Eugene if he checked her out. Then boom. They're all gone. He had hundreds around him. Usually, we could indulge afterward. But now, there's nobody. What about the princess? I have to leave her to him. He's in love. It's bad for the match. Very bad. Can I tell you one more thing? If you do that often... I didn't say "often." I said "sometimes." Sometimes, yes. What you did with me. What I did with you. With your husband, business isn't the only thing floundering. That's not working out either. No. You have it wrong. In fact, it's precisely why I can't get myself to leave him. The mouth, the cock, the ass. You don't even dare say it. That's all Emile and I share together. I only feel good with him in the sack. Other than that... We live on, and we dream on. Your right. Your left. Your right. Alone. Like most people. Conrad. I thought you knew him. Your right. We forgot to tell him. Boss. Max's brother called from Chicago. You jerk! Shit. Why do I pay you for? - Why didn't you tell me? - You had the receiver off. -Tiger Jones, I'll knock him out. - Shit! Yeah, I'm good. All right. I'll be down in 20 minutes. No, I didn't see him. It was your husband. - Did you check about the princess? - Sure did, boss. It's all true. Shit. Easy as A-B-C. Trinculo: "Forgive me my sins." Trinculo: "Forgive me my sins." Stephano: "He that dies pays all debts." "I defy thee. Mercy upon us." "Are you afraid?" Stephano: "No, monster. No, of course." "Don't be afraid, the isle is full of noises, of sounds," "of melodious songs that delight, and do no harm." "Sometimes, the shudder of thousands of instruments." Good evening, Warner. No, please. Finish your chapter. Françoise is on her way. I wanted to roam the world. I left from Dijon, one winter night. On the last train for Paris. It was coming in from Vienna, or Trieste, back then. Istanbul. Yes. Remember, before the train departed, there was a man banging on the cars. Yes. He was banging on the axles. We never knew exactly why. No. There was that other guy, walking up and down the train. He had food to sell. He was yelling: "Ice chuck, ice chuck!" It took me a while to figure out he was saying iced chocolate. - In winter, right? - Right. - And my mother brought me that book. - Where is she? I'll go get her. We got time. Don't mess with me. No. She told me that every time I hit a wall in my life... all I had to do is open the book randomly. I would always find something worthwhile to me. It's been 30 years. Soon as I open it, someone always shows up. And I have yet to read a single line. Is that so? Sorry. I should have waited for Françoise. You would have had time. Don't worry about it. Something to drink, gentlemen? Yes. Perrier. Nothing for me. I'll wait for my wife. Very well, gentlemen. What's up, boys? What were you talking about? Boy stories. Melancholy stories. I doubt it. Not the right time and place. We were talking about books. Right up your alley. Guess you had to be there. What's that dress you're wearing? I started paying you back. Smart move. Excellent. How much? 2,500 francs. I left 1,500. That's what you gave me, right? Not much to start with. It doesn't cover the interest of the interest of the interest. Come on. So... I really took an interest in your business deals. - I know. - So what, goddamn it! - Great start. I'm outta here. - No. We're starting off like you. Emile. Please. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Can we have the menu? Something to drink, ma'am? - No, the menu. - Bring the menu. Right away! Absolutely. Absolutely. So, hows the airline business? Not flying too high, your wife tells me. It's like everything else. Gotta love what you do. Gotta work. Is that how you met? No, I was working for her dad. A company that bought back disabled freighters. Thank you. How's the sole and mushrooms? The bookstore won't be easy either. To me, the only real book is Gone from Liverpool. Liverpool. And also... Edgar's Journey. What's that? Salmon rolls and cabbage? The menu! What's in the Swiss salad? Make that three sandwiches. What's with him? Just as I told your wife. Some people you should stay away from. You mean to say? There's nothing to say. There's nothing to say. Nothing. - About the money you owe me... - That you owe us. That you owe me. I told him about it. You also owe this other guy? To the guy behind him. He knows how to settle scores. That's all. The mafia? Family. That's why he told me about Sicily. This morning, I ran across them in the lobby. An old aristocrat with a young ugly doll. At first, I thought they were guests. We all have family. I was part of it. Somehow. Well, not really. Well, somehow. It was in 1982... 1983. - That's why you flew to Italy so often? - No. I swear I never saw him before. We called him "the accountant." There's a payment I couldn't make on time. Compared to that, banks are angels. Not Northern Europe bank, I tell you. Yeah, but these are Eastern European countries. They gave me until Friday. That's tomorrow. Iced chocolate. That's right. I gotta think of something. Maybe they'll wait until Saturday. You're going to pay them what you owe us? I haven't done it yet. Find something else, my friend. I'm gonna play some pool. I don't agree. There's no reason for this. The match should bring in money. We're in a democracy. Everybody should get his fair share. By the way I didn't understand. 100 percent, four percent... It's easy. We get four percent of gross. - It's simple. - Of what? A sandwich and a beer. Of what? Gross. Box-office receipts. I'll need your help. All we need is to be there. At the right time. Then there's everything else: radio, television. Yeah, everything else. If we stay alive. You think he'll win? He's got his chances. He had his chances. But this girl is messing him up. Shit. What girl? Former treasurer of the Red Brigades. According to Eugene, she's very wealthy. She's the princess? No. So what do we do now? All we need... is just for him to go into the ring. That should do it. All we need is to reach the box office first. - And I'm just by myself. - Master Jim. Chicago! And there are many of them. So what did he ask you? - What about my gift? - Saturday, I told you. So, what did he ask you? He told me to ask hundreds of questions. Until I get no for an answer. - My gift? - Saturday. Hi. I'm working. We're looking for the unknown. Those shitty little Japanese cameras also film at night? Check out all these movie houses. "Ram, ram, thank you, ma'am." "Back door ladies." "On the floor, you whore." I wonder why they say "X" for porn movies. It's the only letter that reads the same in a mirror. "O" is the same back and forth too. What did the lady say? What did she say, goddamn it? Why didn't you tell me that you knew? That you were sleeping around? What did you want me to say? What do we do now? We'll never get this money back. Shit. First door, to your right. Tiger Jones, I'll knock him out! ...nabbed with a plane ticket to Chicago in her purse. I was almost sorry she got caught. Isidore. To work! It's bad to mix love with work. Work! Look at you. If I'm pale, you're livid. Arielle. - Can I ask you a literary question? - Of course. What brings you to Frisco? That's exactly what I was talking about. A missing person. Tough luck. I don't collaborate with police anymore. Especially in San Francisco. - Come on. - Just a sec. - I gotta tell you a story. - Funny. It's as if I were upside down, and you were right side up. We say we'll do this and that. It's all hot air. Most of the time, we do nothing. And if we end up doing something, we're dumbfounded, since it's the exact opposite of what we expected. We don't understand, and others don't either. In the end, everyone is left with his fragment of truth. For example... Hello? Yes, it's Emile. What about Jules? Ouch. Let's talk in an hour. You were right yesterday. Today, Madrid. No! Let's settle this thing with Warner. I just said no, Françoise. I said no. A man's voice. A man's body. Yesterday, you wanted to talk. So, let's go. Since I said I'm not going to Madrid. "Then something incredible happened." "I saw him take his head into his hands and burst out in tears." "It wasn't fake, those were real tears." "His whole body was quivering." "Real tears moistening his fingers," "rolling down his cheeks, while he kept repeating," "My wife is leaving me. My wife is leaving me." What are you saying? Nothing. Go ahead if you want. Do you remember my other first name? What? Why didn't you like my other first name? Genevieve? Yes. Genevieve. I don't feel like talking after all. As you wish. Don't tell me I'm steering the conversation. Repeat what you just said. I don't feel like it after all. Crazy how you say that. What? You're starting to sound fake. Just a bit. I think. Yes. It's true. Could be. Maybe. As if upside down became right side up. Stark naked? You sound a bit fake yourself. You're not taking action. I don't have much charm. That's what you're saying? Less so. No, Emile. Come on. Let's start anew. Yes. Genevieve. - Breakfast. - Set it over there. Let's go. Life's short! "Then, one day," "the mouse who was amiably playing with the cat," "fell under the claws of her recent friend." "She realized that things were back to normal." "With her hopes not too high, she reminded the cat" "the ruling principles of the new order." 'Yes,' answered the cat, "but I am a founding member of the new order." Give me back the gun. To hit without being hit, is seeing a guy collapse in front of you... with just a little punch. You think you didn't hit him. I didn't hit him, so what's he doing on the floor? Was it fear? What are these two doing? - We're jogging. - Jogging, my ass! What's wrong with jogging anyway? "Carpentier, right hitter," "almost KO'd Jack Desm... Jack Dempsey, with a right punch." What should we do with him? Let me work already! Get the hell out! Out you go! "Ray Robinson, floored LaMotta with both hands." Go to bed! "Robert Cohen in flurries..." If you kill Isidore, I kill you. "...in flurries, machine-gun style." It doesn't knock him out. But it scores points. "Jean-Claude Bouttier" "floored Carlos Monzon in 1972." "Thanks to an uppercut." "Robert Villemain, left uppercut to the liver." "Louis Acariès." "The right." "Marvin Hagler, uppercut. Muhammad Ali, 'sting like a bee.' "Roberto Duràn, one of the few to combine all four punches:" "Left jab, right hook, straight left, right hook." We've been doing overtime for three weeks, boss. But I told you, tomorrow. Tomorrow. - I'll be back. - We gotta get out of here. With what? I've got the keys to the Mercedes. No other option. Found something else? No. The machine asked me a question. What question? About morals. How can France aspire to leadership, when every Frenchman is a minor character? I wonder, Prince. I piss at my own speed! Your offer doesn't speak to me. Not anymore. What business sends you to Madrid? Spaniards pay in dollars. It's in everyone's best interest to sum up the situation, Mr. Cheval. Chenal. Chenal. Leave me alone. If Warner gives you our 40 million, I kill him. The rest of your business, I wash my hands with. Have you noticed that there are two types of men? The ones with a clean dick who wash their hands before pissing. To keep it clean. And those with a dirty dick, so when they grab it to piss, they also have dirty hands. And they wash them afterward. If you take our 40 million, we'll kill you! You're mistaken. We're not in some minor French film where actors think that opening their mouth means they're smart. I've been running in circles for the past three days. We're heading back to the Middle Ages, my friend, at warp speed. Warp speed. Presto! I told you, I still love my wife. Your offer stinks. That's theater, Mr. "Cheval," isn't it? I don't go anymore. I only go to movies. Remember that at the theater, we play a part. In the movie, we have played. We won, we lost. But the cards have been dealt. I told you everything. - As for the rest... - Yes. I'm not sure I understand. She would like to go away with him. Go on. - But she is afraid... - Go on. ...that she will miss the other. That she will miss him too much. Too late. She doesn't seem that smart, just looking at her. The two men must be alike, to lust for such a woman. It becomes a mere carnal issue, something physical. Physics or physical? And these. Strawberry or raspberry? - You call this work? - I call it what I want! We only have until Sunday. And all these things about boxing, is it true? If the Luciano brothers are in the hotel, then it's true. What about the money? Money... is like an echo. I'm not sure I understand. Nowadays, it is such. Old days were different. Nowadays, it is an echo. Like diseases. I don't want to hear about that. On the contrary! You, whom I love. Explain to me... You, whom I love. His left hand is under my head. And his right hand... embraces me. You're so late! I thank you, Beauty, for having noticed. I must confess, I was awaiting you with great impatience, Beast. - I need to talk to you. - Beauty! Beauty! I can't live unless I see Father. I beg your permission. Stand up, Beauty! Stand up! It is for me to kneel and obey your orders. Let me go and come back. Upon returning, Beauty, will you be my wife? Boss? So long, boss. Beat it! Get lost in your chick's asshole! Scram! Get drowned in your princess's shit! - Get out! - You gonna be all right, boss? Tiger Jones is KO. - Ready to go? - Yes. - Give me your jewelry. - No, there's no reason. Yes, there is. There's one. I had a dream. I was the one knocking out Tiger Jones. And he left with the princess. I don't know. I had a dream. She was offering me a job as a gardener at her palace in the Bahamas. I didn't hear a thing. They left us the jewels, in case of emergency. Anyway, the jewels are here. We should get going. The match, the money that's all over. We have to leave, Françoise. No more Françoise. That's true. Genevieve. Go on, hurry up. Get your things ready. I'll call you at 10:00. Stop. Max... Dead. Victor... Gone missing. I disagree. Me... I don't know why she wants men and money. I disagree. She doesn't care about money. She doesn't even care about her hair. You saw her hair, right? True. She knows what she wants, but can't express it. Not well. I disagree. She doesn't know what she's doing. And the way she dresses. On that, we agree. She doesn't exactly know what to do, but she does it exactly. I disagree. She's scared, that's all. That's all. That's all of us. We're getting nowhere. One of them seems to be thinking. He's the only one. Thinking. Shrinking. Arielle. Do something! Make something up! Tell him, Uncle, goddamn it! But if you expect me to speak... I won't be able to. Because I understand nothing. And my mouth, like a gaping wound, wishes only to close. Reaps the whirlwind. All these money matters, Mr. Fox, are terrible these days. - Guy Fargeon, dead or alive... - The rest, tonight. Angelo, ask him for explanations. Yes, Prince. So? - I swear, I don't know who he is. - Pick it up! No. I'll pick it up. Angelo, tell this gentleman that we won't ask twice for him to leave. Yes, Prince. "My kid'll fix your kid so she never calls my kid again!" We've encountered too many people like you, Mr. Chenal... who are masters at sowing disaster and reaping consternation. It's true. We've been wandering from town to town... never seeing any light. Only harsh lighting. Because great cities, my Lord, are cursed. Who wrote this, Eugene? The machine only says: "A poet who ceased to write." Since I was born... how many times have I said I'm tired? 25,300 times, boss. And women? How many have I held in my arms? 632. And on my back? On your back? Thirty-nine. And breathing down my neck? Three. And the new one? Genevieve? So? I don't know what's wrong, boss. The machine says it doesn't feel like telling us. - We've got the jewels, boss. - That's right, damn it! Call Sacha. He's in jail, boss. Then call the devil. - What are you doing here? - Cyrille felt ashamed. We've brought you back the Mercedes. Where is it? At the rear entrance, near the pool tables. Go ahead. I'll be right down. Tell the lady in 419 that I'll meet her downstairs. - Go on. - I'll never forget you, Mr. Jim. Don't touch me. I'm chock-full of tears, and it's about to spill over. Since Cyrille brought back the Mercedes, can he borrow the racket? Yeah, sure. That's not a solution. The more I suffer... the more I want that money. We won't get it. No one will. So you're leaving with him? For now, it looks like it. I want to. Even without money. I really want to. I'll write you. You'll come and buy books. Maybe. In the Bahamas. You'll use your wings. Or I'll come back. You always said I was fickle-minded. It's happening once again. You should give them back the child. Go away! A lieutenant and a few men. That should do it. Isidore's an ace! There's more than kings, queens, and jacks! I'm not sure I understand. Language is the king in our bereaved country. But the commentary is the real prince. It's him, him alone, with his critical look, who still drives the action. I'm not sure I understand. I got it. I found out who killed the prince. Here. Two years ago, someone walked into this room. - And then? - Champagne! Go tell Isidore I'm coming. - Can I do the room, Mr. Prospero? - Yes. I'll be right there. Yes, everything's cool. We'll also need an ambulance. I think we should expect at least a couple of dead. In my opinion. See you later. Champagne! Inside the trap. One of these traps in the shape of a cage. The rat remained calm. Disgusted and bored. The man entered the kitchen and started looking at it. When it came across the man's glance, the rat knew he had been assigned a death sentence. Uncle says he found the solution. Really? It thinks about death more than I do. It's him! Stop him! Stop him! I love you. Life is short. Oh, my God! I'm sorry! I'm sorry. Sorry. He says he's sorry. It doesn't matter. I was right. I know who killed the prince. Easy as ABC. Read it to me. Hurry. Hurry! - Call an ambulance for God's sake! - We already did! Hurry. "The given word, which made him in his own eyes" "the equal of impeccable men who never break rank." - "The given word, which made him..." - "The word of the lieutenant." - "the equal of impeccable men." - "Romantic." - "The lieutenant's words..." - "...seem to ring in the distance." "Oh, nonsense, my dear fellow," I began. His impatience showed. "You don't seem to understand," he said. Then, staring at me- "I might have jumped, but I'm not running away." "I didn't want to offend you," I said. Foolishly, I added, "Better men than you have had to run at times." He blushed, while I choked, almost swallowing my tongue. "Perhaps so," he said at last. "I'm not good enough." "I can't afford it. I'm bound to fight this thing down." "That's why I'm fighting. At this very moment." That is why. Stop them. Do something. You know I don't belong to this ugly bunch of people whose cleverness consists of displacing the problem. - To show it off here, where it's not! - Bastard! Go ahead, suit yourself. Go ahead. It was easy as ABC. Two years ago, a hitman was hired to kill someone at the Concorde Saint-Lazare. The guy shows up at the desk, asking for that man. The place was packed, and the clerk was busy on the phone. The killer read the guest list, but upside down. It just slipped his mind that he was reading upside down. So he went up, and killed the guest in room 666 instead of the guest in room 999. Then the prince died. Yes, exactly. See you soon. Easy as can be. Easy as can be. The uncle had a heart, but he used his head. I warned you. Witness equals martyr. What's she doing there? She's calling a cab. The cab pulls off the curb. It follows the ambulance. What's the use? He's dead. You said that to me... earlier in the week. Because... love is eternal. By the way, where did you get the money for the little corridor scene? I'll never say. I'd rather die! No way! Too many dead already.
