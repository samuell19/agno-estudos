Yes, it's open this Friday. So, did you guys clean it? Like, the COVID-19 clean. Yes, ma'am. We disinfect every room, but to be honest, that property hasn't rented in quite a while. Great, that sounds perfect. We'll be there this Friday. I'mma finish booking online. Great. May I have your name? And I'll leave some wine and drinks for you. That's so nice. Thanks. Oh, and it's Eryca. No problem. And make sure you have all the food and everything that you're gonna need, because it's kind of a ride back to the main road. Okay. Got you.

We supposed to be isolatin' ourselves so we can see each other, and this mothafuckah tryna kill a sista. Uh-uh, I ain't tryin' to die. Because I don't need dick that bad. Damn. What did you do? Because I know you didn't leave quietly. Oh, you know I didn't. It took everything I had not to slap the shit out of his ass and her. But I did tell him he can fuck whoever he want to. Just not me. I started to throw the ring at his ass, but then I thought better. No, I'mma keep the ring, but fuck him. Yeah, fuck him. And then I locked him and that stripper bitch inside the room, broke the key in that bitch, and then I left. Okay, don't mess with Trish, ''cause she got somethin' for you. Men. You okay, girl?

Wait, no cars have came down the road, and I'm sure of that. I don't know what you're saying, but I drove my car down here and dropped two bottles of wine off at the Winter's house for Eryca. - You said Eryca? - Yeah. Oh, my God. We drank one of those bottles two days ago. Funny. No, really. Two days ago. That means you've been out here for a day and a half? That's-- that's-- th-- that's not even possible. That's crazy.

Eryca's there, and maybe we can figure this shit out. Personally, I think the air is making people a little crazy. The-- the-- the air? Yes. Trust me. It's bad. The last 48 hours have been the craziest of my life. You think I'm crazy, where is yo' car? Why you don't know where the hell it is? You came out here to lose yo' car? That isn't even the craziest thing that has happened in the last two days. Look at the sky. It's three in the afternoon and the moon is out already. None of this shit is making sense. But I bet you the house is the safest place to be right now. You can do whatever the fuck you want, but I'm going for cover. Hey, over here! Help! You don't know who that is. You're insane.

Authorities say three black women have gone missing after they rented a cabin about two hours north of Atlanta. Police continue to say that there is no evidence of foul play, but locals have reported bright lights, noises, and strange activities in and around the cabin sight. The search continues. Look, Eryca's my big sister, and the first thing I wanna say is, E would never go anywhere for days without notifyin' me. Not one single day. And we talk all the time. Somethin' is wrong. I can feel it and they know it. We want answers, but they're not sayin' anything, and I just want E and her friends back home. Well, Ron, this story has a new development.
