Hello? ﻿Hey, where are you now? ﻿Where else would I be? At home. ﻿Are you really seeing that guy right now? ﻿You were photographed, ﻿The Internet is all fucked up right now. ﻿What? ﻿What picture? ﻿Park Gang. ﻿Hey, hey, get up, quick. ﻿Haven't you left yet? ﻿I thought you were sleeping at the boss's wife's house? ﻿Why are you doing this? ﻿Are you not getting what you need? ﻿It's not about what I need right now. ﻿The reporter found it. ﻿Ha... Just the same with the weird ones. ﻿Is there a picture like this? ﻿Yeah. ﻿You get up? ﻿Are you with Hwa-young? ﻿It looks like that. ﻿You saw the report, right? ﻿I'll run a story denying it. ﻿You get Hwa-young out of here. ﻿What about the report? ﻿They'll say you're friends and not in a relationship. ﻿That's more like an admission than a denial. ﻿What am I supposed to do? ﻿Just say you don't remember. ﻿Just say that from today on. ﻿That's it. I'm bored. ﻿Is that going to work? ﻿Hey! ﻿Yeah? ﻿What are you talking? ﻿Did your company create the report on purpose? ﻿What? ﻿It's nice that you and I have an affair, ﻿which is bad for me but not for you. ﻿There's no such thing as a piece of shit like you. ﻿Why are you doing this again? ﻿What are you looking at? ﻿You said you don't know how to swear. ﻿You are wearing your clothes backwards. ﻿Oh, coffee stains are hard to remove. ﻿Hey, that's an expensive one. ﻿First of all, put your pants on. ﻿Hey, what about the movie? ﻿I said I'd get back to them this morning. ﻿Then we won't reply. ﻿Didn't you even read the script? ﻿I read three pages of the script and I got sleepy. ﻿The director was a beggar, too, ﻿The production company doesn't make a lot of money. ﻿Don't do it. ﻿I hear it's a lot of money. ﻿Then give me 30%. ﻿That's what they said. ﻿Crazy, huh? ﻿That's a lot of money. ﻿OK, then do it. ﻿What about the one that imported the most from the US? ﻿How much? ﻿It's Hollywood. What does money matter? ﻿So I'm supposed to make Hollywood movies for free? ﻿Is there anything more important than money? ﻿Hello. ﻿Come here, come here. ﻿Didn't I tell you to get here early? ﻿Shit. ﻿Let's put it here. ﻿Yeah. ﻿Son. ﻿Just call. How awkward is a video call? ﻿Do you have an early morning schedule? ﻿Our son worked too hard. Where are you now? ﻿Where is Mom now? ﻿I went to Barcelona and took pictures. ﻿Now I'm in Paris. ﻿When did you go there? ﻿Thanks to your money, I'm happy. ﻿This is beyond my wildest dreams. ﻿I don't even have wrinkles on my face. ﻿Because you just went to the hospital ﻿last month for a cosmetic injection, didn't you? ﻿Then son, I love you. ﻿I'm going to get another bag. ﻿Why don't we look at the bad stuff? ﻿We should, go. ﻿Is mom going into the bag business? ﻿How many bags did you buy? ﻿SWITCH ﻿The TV play is good. ﻿How am I doing now? ﻿Will I die next week? ﻿Really? ﻿That won't work. ﻿You're gonna have to cut my heart out. ﻿No, really? ﻿Now I can't sleep well, like 3 hours. ﻿I need a drink so I can sleep again. ﻿Why do you think that is? ﻿I don't know. There's depression, ﻿there's restlessness, but it's complicated. ﻿But I don't feel that way here. ﻿Please relax about everything. Relax. ﻿Regain your throne and change the world, ﻿even if it's for the suffering people. ﻿Me? ﻿Yeah. ﻿You're such a big fan. ﻿The ministers were still at court. ﻿The soldiers were fighting with blood. ﻿They are with us in spirit. ﻿I may come as a king. ﻿Should also grow up with the people, ﻿To make people's lives brighter, ﻿Open my mind. ﻿Open my mind... ﻿Then... ambassador... ﻿Cut! Cut! ﻿This part is too fucking long. ﻿Do you think this is a deliberate delay to fit in with the airtime? ﻿How nice to know your lines by heart. ﻿Wouldn't it be better to check the script when you hate it? ﻿A script has to be like a script. ﻿Do you think this is a script? ﻿Don't you want me to die? Huh? ﻿How are you going to change the world? ﻿It's hard, isn't it? ﻿You guys really, if you have a lot of lines, ﻿can't you at least hold up your cue book? ﻿Forget it. ﻿Take a break, start the reenactment. What else is there to do? ﻿All right, let's take a break. ﻿It's been 12 episodes and there's still half to go. ﻿Do you want to change your lines? ﻿Change the lines? ﻿The writer love it. ﻿If you miss one line, she's gonna mess with you. ﻿Why don't you call her and talk to her? ﻿You talk to me like that, I'll tell her. I'm really gonna get my way if this keeps up. ﻿Well, I didn't have the right personnel. What can I do? ﻿Oh, it's fucking hot. ﻿Is everything okay? ﻿I told you to keep an eye on the temperature. ﻿What was said? ﻿What about the awards show today? Will I get an award? ﻿Am I the kind of person who says something and people follow suit? ﻿I'm going to cool it with ice water. ﻿Clothes clothes, neckline. ﻿Well, the director did that. ﻿Because I'm closer to you. ﻿So far we've met five high-profile candidates. ﻿Wow, the atmosphere is really hot today. ﻿So let me announce first, the Korean Film Awards, ﻿best actor is Park Gang, congratulations. ﻿I wouldn't have come if I'd known you were winning. ﻿Are you still coming home today? ﻿A piece of shit. ﻿It was really intense. ﻿Ten years ago I was a poor, unknown actor. ﻿Often on stage with fewer than 10 people. ﻿At that time, in that small theater, ﻿it was the audience that filled my dreams. ﻿But now, it's a million times that. ﻿I'll be the actor who forgets what he started. ﻿Oh, I'm really not concentrating right now. ﻿I will be an actor who never forgets what I started, thank you. ﻿Park Gang ﻿Best Actor Award Winner Watch the news. ﻿Best Actor Award Winner ﻿"To become an actor who has lost his original heart” Park Gang's ridiculous award acceptance speech ﻿I thought you two were talking to each other when you got the trophy. ﻿What did you say? ﻿What did you say? We're talking about a nephew or something. ﻿What did you say? Oh, shut your mouth. ﻿It's time to break up, too. ﻿Didn't I break up the fight? ﻿Should've tried harder to break it up. ﻿But will you listen to me? ﻿Oh, whatever, for fuck's sake. ﻿Did you put perfume on your feet, too? It smells good. ﻿Oh, it's cold. Close the window. ﻿Isn't it near this store? ﻿How about a drink? ﻿Today? ﻿It's Christmas Eve. ﻿So what? What's the point? ﻿I can't. My kids are waiting for me. ﻿What about me without a family? ﻿Just a pair of chopsticks, some good wine, and some gossip. ﻿I'll have to ask about the company. ﻿You've been working with me too long. ﻿Thank you for your hard work. ﻿You work alone, too. It's hard. ﻿Don't mention it. ﻿Hey, you don't know anything about that. ﻿It's hard work working with someone like me. ﻿Ah, it's really cold! ﻿I know, I know. ﻿Hey, I gave the car away. ﻿Did you fall asleep on Christmas? ﻿Do you have a date? ﻿You should go, too. ﻿You don't listen. You have to do something. ﻿Ask me if I like the uncle out there better than you. ﻿Go shopping for presents. ﻿. That's why I said it. ﻿Make it clear he's getting lots of presents tomorrow. ﻿Not from Santa, from me. ﻿If only you were Santa Claus. ﻿Hey, do you want to watch the play and take care of the kids? ﻿Why? What are you doing? ﻿You seemed happier then. So why did you give up acting? ﻿I thought you were gonna turn that mole into a cruise ship. ﻿Ah, I should have dotted this mole. ﻿Why? ﻿That time you and I went to the last audition. I sometimes wonder what would have happened if it had been me instead of you. ﻿If I don't get elected, I'll do the same things you did that you're sorry for. ﻿Surprise! ﻿So many people... Oh, I hate to think about it. ﻿In that case, at least it wouldn't be so poor here. ﻿Will have a good life with Soo-yeon. ﻿Do you want to die? ﻿Oh, right. ﻿I heard Soo-yeon went back to Korea. ﻿It seems that she will have an exhibition ﻿at the Art museum in Insa-dong for a while. ﻿Break up. ﻿What? ﻿It seems better to break up. ﻿Let's just break up. Damn, because I know how strong soju is, so I can't get drunk. ﻿Let's go to round two. ﻿Go to my home? ﻿Don't you know it's Christmas Eve? ﻿Christmas bullshit. That's the whole vibe. ﻿Ah, here we go, taxi.. ﻿Here ﻿Take care. ﻿Hi, I'm with him. ﻿Come on, come on. ﻿Your kids are waiting. ﻿It's okay. I'll take you home first. ﻿Forget it. ﻿You know what? Let's go. ﻿You have to go before I regret it. ﻿And what you were saying about the company. ﻿It's nothing. ﻿Also, if Hwa-young calls, it's gonna be a big deal. ﻿Oh, SHH. ﻿Call me when you get back. Be careful. ﻿I guess I had a lucky Christmas ﻿to be of service to you. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Are you happy, the one who has everything. ﻿You can't be unhappy. ﻿Right? I was in a play, too, although it was a long time ago. ﻿That's too hard.. ﻿I know that. ﻿Jim Carrey once said, ﻿All of us, if we were rich and famous, would know that's not the right answer. ﻿How about that? When you become rich, ﻿when you become famous, do you know that's not the right answer? ﻿What's the right answer? ﻿I have no way of knowing. ﻿Yeah, well, that was such a selfish thing to say, ﻿I know, you don't know, and that would be shit. ﻿What is the right answer in life? ﻿Are you not satisfied with this life now? ﻿Do you have any regrets? ﻿If you had the chance to change your choice, what would you do? ﻿I don't know what you're saying. ﻿Dad's sleeping here again. ﻿You fall in bed when you sleep. ﻿It's like stepping back in time. ﻿Cheer up. Are you all right? ﻿Who are you? ﻿Oh, the smell of alcohol. ﻿How many drinks did you have? That's smells. ﻿Drink alcohol every day. ﻿It's a daily worry, for real. ﻿What's going on here? ﻿Where is this? ﻿Where could it be? Your house. ﻿Your house? ﻿Who are they? ﻿What, the twins' faces, too? Are you crazy? ﻿Am I dreaming now? ﻿Stop talking in your sleep and cheer up. ﻿Boys, scoop up a ladle of water. ﻿Yes! ﻿Did you make a mistake? Are you wrong? ﻿Wait. ﻿Really. ﻿Hey. It's Christmas. ﻿Dad. ﻿It's scary. ﻿The number you dialed does not exist. ﻿Why can't I get a hold of him? ﻿So crazy. ﻿Shit. ﻿Park it on the third floor. ﻿Sir, sir, sir. ﻿Hello. ﻿Who's going in there now? ﻿For the first time, is it someone who lives here? ﻿I don't think so. ﻿The password is incorrect. ﻿Oh, I'm sorry. ﻿This is clearly the place. ﻿What do you want to do? ﻿Why do you keep pressing my combination lock? ﻿This is my house. ﻿What? Are you a thief? ﻿Are you calling me a thief? ﻿Damn it, don't you know me? ﻿Who are you? ﻿Who am I? ﻿Who are you? ﻿Wait a minute, Sir. ﻿Get out of the way. ﻿Call the police. ﻿Get out of here, you psycho. ﻿Call the police and take him to the police station. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿I think there's been a misunderstanding. ﻿Miss, do you know me? ﻿Who are you? ﻿Is this someone you know? ﻿Do you know me? ﻿I don't know who you are. ﻿But I think I've seen you somewhere. ﻿What is it, you two? ﻿Did you cheat again? ﻿No. ﻿Hey, hey get him. ﻿Is it you this time? ﻿I don't know anything! ﻿Yuck. ﻿Who are you?! ﻿No, no, no. ﻿No. ﻿I don't know you! ﻿No, darling. ﻿I'm not crazy. ﻿I said I live there! I made a deal! Deal! ﻿Calm down! ﻿That house is not your house. ﻿Look. ﻿You have lived in Suin-dong, Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province for nearly 10 years. ﻿How many times have I told you. ﻿It's my house. How can you say it's not my house? ﻿Ah, is this system input correct? ﻿Is it correct? Is it true that everything is correctly entered? ﻿What do you think we're gonna do? ﻿Is there a Park Gang here? ﻿You have to apologize for walking into someone's house. ﻿What are you doing here right now? ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Is this your wife? ﻿No. ﻿No? ﻿You don't know her? ﻿I know. ﻿You hate it living with me? ﻿Mrs. Mrs. calm down. ﻿The victim and we have made peace. ﻿We will take pre-emptive action. ﻿But be careful, ﻿Your husband doesn't seem to be doing very well. ﻿What does that mean? ﻿He kept saying he was an actor or something. ﻿But no one knows who he is. ﻿Is your husband an actor? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Actor? ﻿I've seen a lot of movies. I've never seen him. ﻿What did he do? ﻿It's kind of... ﻿It's a play. He's a play actor, isn't he? ﻿But he keeps saying he won an award. ﻿He says he's one of Korea's top actors. ﻿He kept saying that. ﻿Is it okay to say that? ﻿He said he was having an affair with an actress. ﻿Him? ﻿That's what he said. ﻿Oh, is him crazy? ﻿Officer, you look at me. ﻿Finally, really look at me. ﻿Take a look. ﻿Don't you know me? ﻿Oh, I'm so sorry. ﻿What a madman. Sorry. ﻿I'll take him right away. ﻿Good. ﻿Ah, what is the world coming to? ﻿Are you Soo-yeon? ﻿You've had too much to drink. Shut up. ﻿Hey, are you really married to me? ﻿Am I really your husband? ﻿What the hell are you doing here? ﻿Why don't you pull yourself together? Don't you want to snap out of it? ﻿I had a drink with Jo Yoon last night. ﻿Then I got into a taxi. ﻿How come there is such a taxi? ﻿Are you unhappy with your life right now? ﻿What if you didn't break up with her then? ﻿Have you ever thought of that? ﻿I will turn that idea into reality. ﻿There's no better opportunity than to experience it firsthand. ﻿This will make for a very special Christmas present. ﻿Aren't you getting out of the car? ﻿So this is, uh, the neighborhood where you and I live? ﻿I can't stand it. ﻿How long have we been living here? ﻿Ah, why this kind of neighborhood? ﻿I told you I can't take it anymore. ﻿Just listen to me for a second. ﻿What's going on with me. ﻿What's going on with me... ﻿What's going on... ﻿Dad, what are you doing here? ﻿Mom is really angry now. ﻿So... ﻿You're my daughter right? ﻿Yeah. ﻿What's your name? ﻿Lu-yi. ﻿What's the name of that jarhead? ﻿Lu-a. ﻿Are you elder sister? ﻿He's the older brother, but we were born three minutes apart. ﻿This is your home? ﻿Dad why are you like this, it's weird. ﻿Did you drink too much to make your brain go bad? ﻿Can you help me? ﻿What? ﻿I lost my memory. ﻿Uncle? ﻿Have you become a fool? ﻿I'm not becoming a fool. ﻿It's the memory that's gone. ﻿Is it like a TV show? ﻿Yes, that's right. ﻿I don't know anything. ﻿Don't know your mother. ﻿What's the kid's name? ﻿Lu-a? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Anyway, it's our secret. ﻿I need your help until I find my memory. ﻿Dad when are your memories going to come back? ﻿I don't know. ﻿I'm going shopping with my friends after work today, ﻿So I'm gonna be a little late, okay? ﻿If you can't keep going, take the kids to a coffee shop. ﻿Me? ﻿Who else could it be. ﻿Where is that? ﻿You have time for drinks, not kids. ﻿Just hire a babysitter. ﻿It's more complicated than I thought. It's a pain in the ass. ﻿Baby what? ﻿Sitter. ﻿How much did you drink yesterday? ﻿With whom? ﻿You go there. ﻿So... ﻿So just don't think about the unrealistic things. ﻿Those people will only drink with you. ﻿Will they pay for you? ﻿The landlord said he was going to raise the rent. ﻿Do you need rent for a place like this? This neighborhood is... ﻿Who are we living in this kind of place because of? ﻿Your eyes seem to have gotten bigger. ﻿Kids, mommy will be back tonight. ﻿Mommy have a good time. ﻿You guys have to be good with Daddy. ﻿When will you be back? ﻿I don't know. ﻿What time will you be back? ﻿I don't know. ﻿What about the kids? ﻿Hey, what kind of person is your mother? ﻿She's scary. ﻿Scary? ﻿You're scared of her, Dad. ﻿You said mom was scarier than a ghost. ﻿No. ﻿I don't know who it is, but it's all waiting. ﻿Can you hear me? ﻿Do you want me to speak up? ﻿Hello? ﻿Hello. ﻿Is there a place here without kids? ﻿This is a children's cafe. ﻿Dad, it's too hot. Help me tie my hair. ﻿I don't know how to do this. ﻿You go home and ask your mom. ﻿What is he doing, what is he up to? ﻿He now thinks he's a robot. ﻿Just press this button. ﻿Hello. You guys play here for a while. ﻿Why? ﻿I'll come back later. ﻿Do you want to go to a billiard hall? ﻿We're going to call Mom. ﻿What is the model number of that car? ﻿It seems to be Schwartz and it seems not. ﻿There are different colors of cars, many companies, and many regulations. ﻿So you have to be more precise. ﻿I remember that the cab had Christmas tree like covers on the roof. ﻿Green and red mixed together. ﻿Ah, the Christmas tree? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Jingle bell. ﻿Yeah. ﻿There doesn't seem to be a car like that yet. ﻿Dad, I've seen cars like that. ﻿Have you? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Where is it? ﻿In the fairy tale book. ﻿Let's go. ﻿No, Dad, don't go. ﻿Now my situation is not quite normal. ﻿Is it because of too much exhaustion? ﻿Aren't you my primary care doctor? ﻿I took the medication last time I came too. ﻿I also gave you a signature. ﻿You really don't recognize me, do you? ﻿Ah, what do I have to say now to get it right. ﻿I'm a fan of yours. ﻿Ah, yes, that's it. ﻿That's what you said. ﻿Thank you so much. ﻿I've been dying for a while now. ﻿Ah, what to do. ﻿Surprise. ﻿Dad, after you leave the address, let's go home. ﻿But Lu..Lu-yi? ﻿What is my occupation? ﻿Why do you ask this? ﻿You are an actor. ﻿It seems I'm not very famous now. ﻿But occasionally someone will recognize you, but occasionally, very rarely. ﻿I heard that you are a famous unknown actor. ﻿What do you mean, what does that mean? ﻿You are the reproduction actor. ﻿Reproduction actor. ﻿Oh, it's dad. ﻿Get inspiration from your dreams every night. ﻿The hard-working and smart Park Jeong-sam... ﻿Like a ghost, so scary. ﻿Go away, go away. ﻿Now that you've sobered up. ﻿Let's explain what happened from yesterday until this morning. ﻿What do I have to explain? ﻿Why do you want to go to someone else's house? ﻿Will you believe me? ﻿It's a whole other world. ﻿What, talk about it. ﻿I'm actually a very famous actor. ﻿I live there alone. ﻿But... ﻿I took a very strange cab last night. ﻿That cab driver said he wanted to give me a special gift. ﻿What kind of gift? ﻿You and the kids. ﻿Because this is the life I didn't choose before. ﻿So what? ﻿I rode in that cab and woke up the next morning ﻿in a life with you and the kids like I am now. ﻿What's wrong with you. ﻿Are you preparing a surprise? ﻿Are you still sober? ﻿What's this? ﻿2, don't joke about it. ﻿You don't believe it, do you? ﻿I can't believe it either. ﻿But that's where I am now. ﻿Really. ﻿So now that you've been given such a beautiful gift, do you regret it? ﻿Are you wearing perfume? ﻿Ah, no. ﻿Are you crazy, spraying perfume in the middle of the night. ﻿You're smoking again, aren't you? ﻿Say "ah." ﻿Did you brush your teeth? ﻿Yes. ﻿I brushed to the corners. ﻿What's going on? You've even brushed your teeth. ﻿What, you took off all your clothes? ﻿I'm still wearing my underwear. ﻿Put your clothes on, you'll catch a cold. ﻿You can take your arm off after I fall asleep. ﻿Soo-yeon. ﻿Umm. ﻿Good night. ﻿Try this. ﻿Dad, please. ﻿Play with us. ﻿Dad, I want to eat this. ﻿Wait a minute. ﻿Go away. ﻿Mom will be back. ﻿Be good. ﻿It's not right. ﻿It's pretty. ﻿You still think it's not real? ﻿I don't know. A whole week of goofing off and thinking about other things ﻿and you still haven't hit the ground running by now? ﻿I said it's not because of that. ﻿Is the script out this week? ﻿What's the role? ﻿What script are you talking about? ﻿No surprise for tomorrow? ﻿Do you have a script? ﻿You try a little harder. ﻿Even if there are small works, but no small actors. ﻿I am really a big sinner. ﻿Not another crime, but the crime of egregious betrayal of the Korean people. ﻿Okay, cut. ﻿Ah, the emotion is good. ﻿Let's do the next. ﻿Let me do it again, just once. ﻿Actor Park why are you like this. The promise between you and me you remember? The emotion is not right. ﻿It'd good enough. ﻿I thought Ahn Jo Yoong-geun was alive again. ﻿Let's move on to the next scene. ﻿I'll try one more time, just one more time. ﻿Isn't there any hurry in waiting? ﻿Oh, I'm sorry. ﻿Then let's do it again ﻿Quiet! Quiet! ﻿Cue. ﻿Okay, good. ﻿Super good. ﻿I didn't even finish my lines. ﻿All in all good. ﻿I'll try again. ﻿Why try it again. ﻿Take a break and.. ﻿Oh, you go home. Go home. ﻿Are you the only one who's an actor? ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿All right, come on out. ﻿I can do better. ﻿Come out. ﻿I'll do it. ﻿Action. ﻿I am really a big sinner. ﻿Not another crime.. ﻿Dad's so cool. ﻿That's not my acting skills. ﻿Why turn off the TV? The kids are watching. ﻿Your acting was really good this week. It's nice to be emotionally involved. ﻿Have you ever been this good an actor before? ﻿What good is that? ﻿The best of the reenactors is sitting here right now. ﻿Dad, is it better to be the lead or the reenactor? ﻿Is that a good question? The lead actor, of course. ﻿What about the reenactors? ﻿Stupid, they don't even need reenactors, so it's great. ﻿Right? ﻿Your dad is lead in the play. ﻿A play? ﻿Soo-yeon. ﻿Yeah? ﻿Why do you have to cook like this? ﻿What's wrong? ﻿Rice with fried rice cake, mixed vegetables, vegetarian noodles. ﻿I even made side dishes. ﻿There're side dishes? ﻿If you don't eat it, I'll take it away. ﻿It's tiring to cook the side dishes. ﻿Woo-hee. ﻿Who's that? Other girls? ﻿She is a junior to the play, named Woo-hee, who looks like a boy. ﻿Yeah, Woo-hee. ﻿You really haven't changed a bit. ﻿You need to get married soon. ﻿Don't gossip. It's annoying. ﻿Ah, the boss is like a beggar too. ﻿It's so cold. ﻿Today there are no more than 10 people. ﻿If you cut out more, it's down to two. ﻿How much do you get for this? ﻿Why? Do you need it? ﻿No, thinking about this kind of stage, wondering how much money I could make. ﻿But don't you like 201? ﻿Why like that? ﻿I changed my mind. ﻿I don't know if it's because it's another world. It's so tired here. ﻿Another world? ﻿Breaking away from known civilization seems like a few days ago. ﻿What are you talking about. ﻿But where is Jo Yoon? ﻿Jo Yoon? ﻿He couldn't get through. He couldn't be reached. ﻿He used to like you. Didn't know you were a boy. ﻿A neurotic. ﻿Don't you dare go see that guy. ﻿Curious about where he is and doing what. ﻿Why are you acting like this? ﻿What's going on? ﻿Isn't his movie in theaters? ﻿Is he making a movie these days? ﻿Just that guy? ﻿What movie? ﻿That vibe is no joke. ﻿Now the box office is over 10 million. ﻿Really? And what is his role? ﻿Does he get paid? ﻿This is the last day I can see you. ﻿I don't care if you have any questions about me now. ﻿So handsome. ﻿Ah, I changed with Jo Yoon. ﻿You said who? ﻿Jo Yoon, I'm his friend. ﻿Have you been contacted in advance? ﻿Because the phone number has changed. ﻿So you don't know your friend's phone number? ﻿He is not in right now. ﻿It's there, right? ﻿He seems to be there. ﻿Sir, you can't go over there. ﻿Hey, why have you grown so tall? Sir, you can't go over there. ﻿What's with this height of yours? ﻿You, take off your glasses. ﻿You're looking better. ﻿You look better now. ﻿Have you eaten? ﻿How about a meal together? ﻿You like sashimi, right? ﻿Yes, I do. ﻿What's going on here? ﻿The time has come when you can be the main character with that face. ﻿Sorry ﻿I admit it, okay oaky I admit it. ﻿Now that my face is on the screen, I can't even get used to it. ﻿Isn't that strange? ﻿I said I admit it. ﻿But you do look better. ﻿The eyes seem to have become sharper as well. ﻿This is a slight facelift, not obvious. ﻿Ah this is very expensive. ﻿You did a facelift? ﻿The eyeliner is a tattoo. ﻿A bit confusing, to be honest. ﻿But it makes me feel good to see that you are living a good life now. ﻿It is thanks to your blessing. ﻿The audition at that time. ﻿Audition? ﻿Don't remember? ﻿You and I went to the final round of auditions. ﻿I was nervous. ﻿You suddenly went after Soo-yeon at the airport. ﻿Me? ﻿Yeah, you were good at acting. ﻿And you're calm. ﻿How's your wife and the children? ﻿What about you? ﻿How is Yoo-chan? ﻿Who's Yoo-chan? ﻿Your son. ﻿How can I have a son? ﻿Yoo-chan. ﻿Who's Yoo-chan? ﻿Your son. ﻿I don't have a son. ﻿How's your wife? ﻿I don't have a wife. ﻿Yoo-chan's mom. ﻿Who's You-chan's mom? ﻿Stop joking. ﻿Don't drink anymore, you're drunk. ﻿You and I got to that final audition. ﻿You suddenly went after Soo-yeon at the airport. ﻿What? When did you come? ﻿When I first met you. ﻿You had paint all over your hands. ﻿I got this far by a man who got on me not because of ﻿my face but because he liked my hands. ﻿I didn't even see your face at the time. ﻿But why is it a bit suspicious? ﻿Are you going to do something today that you haven't done before? ﻿Don't you want to continue painting? ﻿I've been drawing every day. ﻿Not in a place like this where you teach the aunties in the neighborhood to draw. ﻿I just looked at it and you drew it very well. ﻿Don't you regret it? ﻿Regret what? ﻿You had the opportunity to study abroad and could have continued your studies. ﻿What would have happened if I had left your hand to go to New York at that time? ﻿I occasionally wonder. ﻿If that were the case, maybe you could still have a painting exhibition now. ﻿And also hear a lot of appreciation for living like that. ﻿I don't want it. ﻿Then there would be no more Lu-yi and Lu-a in the world. ﻿It's full of memories of playing with the kids. ﻿I love this life now. ﻿Very happy. ﻿Anyway, I'm in a good mood that you liked my painting. ﻿Shall we go for a drink together? ﻿You're really pretty. ﻿What? ﻿I said you're even more beautiful and lovely than I remembered. ﻿What's that look in your eyes? ﻿It really makes my heart flutter. ﻿There's someone there. ﻿Be quiet. ﻿Go there, there. ﻿You seem to be different lately. ﻿What's different? ﻿Suddenly. ﻿What's wrong? ﻿Kids will be awakened. ﻿Nothing. ﻿Are you two dating? ﻿No, what date. ﻿Come here. ﻿I dreamt of a ghost. ﻿A ghost? ﻿You two aren't dating, are you? ﻿Mom will marry Lu-a. ﻿Ghost-like brat. ﻿Dad do you have all your memories back now? ﻿Not yet. ﻿You seem to have gotten better with Mom. ﻿Because you said you were afraid of mom. ﻿How long do I have to keep a secret? ﻿Hello, Papa Lu-a. ﻿These are the mothers of our class. ﻿Hello. ﻿It's a great show this week. ﻿How can you play Ahn Jung-geun better than he is? ﻿Thanks. ﻿Shall we go to karaoke together sometime? ﻿What are they saying? ﻿Dad is very popular among the aunts. ﻿Hey. ﻿It's not like it's supposed to be that way. ﻿Oh, sir, will you be quiet? ﻿Calm down. ﻿Seems like you have something. ﻿All for a reason. ﻿In fact, who could I talk to for so long? ﻿It's been a long time. ﻿It's been a long time. ﻿Oh, be quiet. ﻿Miss, can you be a little polite? ﻿Wow, we really ordered a lot of dishes. ﻿Come by once in a while when you can't sleep. ﻿Maybe the chair is too comfortable and I look asleep? ﻿Extenuating circumstances. ﻿You take your time eating. ﻿It's not cooked yet. ﻿How about a little more? ﻿Your wife won't feed you? ﻿There's rice, but no meat. ﻿Only meat for the kids. ﻿I see that movie seems to be very hot? ﻿Did you open your mouth? ﻿Can I have your signature? ﻿Look at the number of viewers from today, ﻿around 3 million, earning a lot of additional rights and rewards. ﻿Hey, you know a lot about this, huh? ﻿Start getting more dividends from next year. ﻿Because that's the one that will invest in the movie. ﻿To write there?

Aww, sweet. ﻿That's why we need to have a daughter. ﻿Raising a son doesn't help at all. ﻿Grandma's wrinkles are caused by dad. ﻿You also said before that there is no wrinkles. ﻿That's why you have to work to earn money. ﻿Mom I have class in the morning. ﻿You go to class, who sends the kids to cram school? ﻿The kids' dad. ﻿You're not doing the independence movement now? ﻿What is it? ﻿Why don't you go back to playing Ahn Jung-geun? ﻿I'm not doing it. ﻿So you don't do anything? ﻿He's working, he's acting in a play. ﻿That's bullshit. ﻿Can you get enough to eat by acting in a play? ﻿I'll go first. ﻿That bag of yours looks good. ﻿This one? ﻿Give it to me when you're tired of using it. ﻿Hasn't mom changed at all? ﻿Wait, when I get famous, I'll buy you a bag. ﻿You? ﻿The sun is beating down in the west, ﻿will this day come? ﻿Why you take all that? ﻿There are still edges, right? ﻿Here's the situation now. ﻿But the life before, I bought you a lot of bags. ﻿What a load of bullshit. ﻿I didn't just buy you a bag, I sent you on several cruises. ﻿In a previous life? ﻿I must have been your dog in a previous life. ﻿You can't even remember that. ﻿Why don't you act in TV anymore ah, no call usually, every week I look forward to that. ﻿That one is more difficult than thinking about it. ﻿Is there anything in the world that is not tiring? ﻿I'll make a TV series or a movie. Wait. ﻿Is that so? When? ﻿Do you have lines? ﻿Don't look down on people. ﻿I'm going to audition from now on, so just wait and see. ﻿Just turn on the TV and you'll see Jo Yoon. ﻿How are you worse than him? ﻿You are not lacking in appearance or acting skills either. ﻿What is it? ﻿Pocket money. ﻿What's the point of giving me pocket money? ﻿I'm at the age where I should be giving you pocket money. ﻿Take Soo-yeon and the kids to buy some good food ﻿and use the rest of the money to buy flowers to visit your father's columbarium. ﻿It's almost time for the anniversary of your father's death. ﻿Forget it. ﻿The closest person to him is you. ﻿What then, let me go? ﻿Let's go together. I'm not going. ﻿I don't want to go either. ﻿If neither of us wants to go, then you, as the son, have to go. ﻿Your father should be sorry now. ﻿It's been 20 years now. ﻿I can't remember my dad's face. ﻿Go look in the mirror, he looks exactly like you. ﻿I thought the sky was falling when you said you were going to do the play. ﻿Bye mom. ﻿Are you still not going in? ﻿You guys go in. ﻿Dad don't you want to see grandpa? ﻿He doesn't go to see his grandfather because he wants to see him so badly. ﻿He is mentioned every Christmas. ﻿And says something about not going in. My dad, not quite like your dad. ﻿What's different? ﻿I've seen him less than ten times in my life. ﻿So you hate him? ﻿Nor do I hate him. ﻿You guys would be sad if you didn't have a dad, right? ﻿Your dad is the same way. ﻿It would be embarrass to cry in front of you. ﻿Dad is an adult now. ﻿Do adults cry too? ﻿Not all adults are strong. ﻿So, just let Daddy wait here. ﻿Dad, I want to live. ﻿Please save me. ﻿I want to live and come back here again. ﻿Very well. ﻿It was good, but the lines were a little too contrived. ﻿The emotions are also too much. ﻿Then I'll tone it down a bit and do it again. ﻿No, that's all. ﻿You're in the University Avenue public performance now, right? ﻿Yes. ﻿Are you and Jo Yoon old friends? ﻿You two used to act together? ﻿Yes. ﻿Okay, I got it.
