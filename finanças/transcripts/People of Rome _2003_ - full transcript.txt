- 'Morning! - Good morning. - "Friends, Romans, countrymen..." - Here he goes again! "Lend me your ears: I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him." "The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interred with their bones." "So let it be with Caesar." "The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious." "If it were so, it was a grievous fault," "And grievously hath Caesar answered it." "He was my friend, faithful and just to me." "But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man." Oh! They fired five more yesterday. Haven't you yet told your wife? No. Why don't you stay in bed?! You can afford it. You're a bachelor! Because I get up! You know... .. after 20 years of getting up at 04:00... how can one go on sleeping? Have you called Salvetti? What about the lawyer? This lawyer is never around. Alright, drop it, I'm coming! Thanks you! D'you mind if I record? I work for an international agency. I'm an independent reporter, a freelancer. I'm gathering material for an investigation about strangers in the Eternal City. Subheading: "A Non-EU National in Rome." As a method for my investigation I have chosen the tailing of reality. - As Zavattini put it... D'you know him? - Eh! I'm even taking visual notes! You'll be wandering: "How?" With these glasses, you see? See this little hole? There's a tiny video camera hidden there with which I record faces, gestures, intimate movements of the human soul... I'll show you right away... Can you hold these a second? Thanks. I'll show you that, while we were talking, I recorded you, without you being aware. Look in here. You see? Look. You sure are photogenic... - I'll go sit somewhere else. - Wait, wait, wait... This week I've made recordings, for instance, in Piazza Vittorio... I'll show them to you. Here... Look, also with glasses. Here's Stazione Termini. I was asking where Aurora Guest-House was. These are two friends of mine. They helped me to test the camera. Here I asked for a light and this Chinese woman gave me a lighter. This one here is a basketball player, or a... .. or a bodyguard... Go figure it out! This is a Dominican woman recorded while laughing, without her being aware. Here we are in Piazza Vittorio... .. as you can see. Here I've asked for a cigarette. This Pakistani gave me one and there was Pakistani stuff inside too... All in all a nice day. Must've smoked 150 cigarettes that day. Rome doesn't ghettoize, and the stranger doesn't feel ghettoized! He lives as if he was back home. Half a million of Indians, Pakistani, Russians, Chinese... ...live in Garbatella, in Pigneto, in Piazza Vittorio, in Tufello. Mixed with the indigenous population. Countries historically and politically at war, like the Russians and the Afghans, the Indians and the Chinese, the Greeks and the Turks live peacefully in Rome. - Hi, Alessandro. - Cappuccino and croissant. Mysteriously, the Chinese, the Afghan and the Arab, in Rome, become Romans. Being black in Africa isn't a problem, but in other countries it is. They get noticed! In Rome, it's different. Rome has its own way of behaving with Non-EU nationals. Doesn't love them, doesn't hate them... Then what? It ignores them! Because it knows that, sooner or later, they'll go away as the barbarians, the invaders, the liberators, the intruders of all ages did, without leaving a trace! In fact, it was the Romans who, wherever they went, they left behind, you named it: ...aqueducts, coliseums, via sacras, triumphal arches... Like lots of avant la lettre McDonalds! Must be all these ruins, these stones that just don't stop popping out... You raise a cobblestone and a Roman villa with swimming pool springs out! This makes even the most ignorant Roman feel superior to everyone. You can be a philosopher, you can have eight degrees... You're black, with beads around your neck and feathers on your ass, getting noticed? I ain't even looking at you! Look what's here and deal with it! - Right. - I'm right? - Sure! - See. And then, it's enough going around the city... .. to read what the Romans shout on the walls. Because the walls are the city's voice. Spray cans, chalk markers, whitewash... .. are the only guarantees for a pluralist... .. information system, an alternative to media concentration, the highest in the world in Italy! I made a brief review of the writings on the walls of Rome. I ended up with this short list. 856 "Forza Roma". 702 "Forza Lazio". 90 "Long live pussy". 75 "Death to the priests". 38 "God exists", with the variant "God exists..." "or pretends to". - "or pretends to". You know this one... Three "Rome to the Romans, Out with Arabs and Africans"... .. and two, thank God only two: "It's not we who're racists, it's you who are black". That's a very good media compared with that of the other... .. European metropolis. I really don't want to say that the Romans are indifferent by nature, I don't want to say that they don't have their passions, their racism. There's racism even here, because even here black persons are burnt alive They starve to death, they freeze to death, but it's different! Between a black and a Lazio fan, the Roman prefers hating the Lazio fan. - That's only normal! - Thanks God! Let's also say that the Roman is not a victim of those prejudices, of those commonplaces... .. saying that the immigrant steals the job... .. from the entitled local. That's not the case here. The job is the only thing that... .. the Roman is happy to have it stolen from him. Let's say it loud and clear: when the Roman works, he gets doubly tired. - First because he's working and second... - .. because he doesn't like it! - See? After all, how does the city's anthem go? - What do we care? What do we care? - That again?! This business again?! - If the barman put water... Again?! - I meant... We tell him, we tell him: You put in water and we won't pay you! But we are the ones who... I mean, in Rome, the threshold for tolerance is a high one. Xenophobia, racism, hunting the black demand too much energy! And, to say it his way, too much ass busting! We like chicken, lamb and chicken, If you want us to making a living, you must let us live, sir! Turning it off, 'cause got to get down. - Sorry...- The society of the youth, - Thanks, and well sung. .. We like to eat... D'you mind if I record? Damn, I forgot my camera! D'you see these glasses? They are sunglasses, there's no camera. I'll explain. I'm gathering material for an investigation about the out of Rome in Rome. As the method of investigation, I've chosen the tailing of truth, as Trapattoni puts it. D'you know him? Let's agree with some colleagues that the problem is that we don't ghettoize. There's no ghettoizing in Rome. It's not like in New York, Madrid, London and Paris, where strangers are offered Chinatowns, are offered India Air, Air India, whatever, Little Italys, Harlems... Because being black... Being black... I mean, tropical... In a Roman Harlem you wouldn't arouse too much attention. Here, on the contrary... someone like you... .. gets noticed. The Roman male, when saying one like this, doesn't ask himself all these questions: who is she?, where is she from?, is she Swedish, from the south? No! Let's be clear: were I a philosopher, with eight degrees, liking chicken and lamb... That's not the point. We're aware that you, strangers, barbarians, invaders from no matter what age, what do you do: you come and you go away! Leaving us the pissoirs, the aqueducts, the McDonald. You're a little mixed up! What d'you mean mixed up? Nothing more clear than this... - I got blue balls. - I guess so. - No, no... What am I to do? What am I to do? What am I to do? Why had it to happen to me? Come on, Maria! These things happen! But Christian doesn't deserve it! Christian is so sweet, so good, so sensitive... It's just that I then met Amedeo and what shouldn't have happened, happened. What can I do? Amedeo entered into my blood, into my bones... Yeah, sure... I know where he entered! I must find a way out, I can't go on like this. All I do is think about this. I can't concentrate on anything else! I can see that! Two artichokes in three hours! What am I to do? What am I to do? I'll kill myself! I'll kill myself! I'll kill myself! I'll kill myself! You're dragging it! What'll happen? - You fell for someone else! So? - So?! Look who's talking! Back in your country they'd stone you for much less! That's exactly why I'm in Rome! - Have you never cheated on my brother? - Are you nuts? Think about the lies, the subterfuges, for the love of God! Second, Marione is not Cristian! D'you know the why he hits? And then, where would I find one more handsome than Marione? Good morning! Hi, little ones! - Hi, tiny. - You're gorgeous! - Hi, love. What were you talking about? Always chatting, you two! Great! You do everything better than mother! You don't even qualify! That's what was missing... - Got to go to the shop. - You're working today too?! Yeah, got to go to the shop: have to deliver a wing chair I restored. Hurry up, mum! Got to wash. - It's dad. - Got to wash all the same. What shall I do? What shall I do? What shall I do? - What shall I do? - What shall you do? - You pick up the phone and tell him. - Yeah, sure... He won't be able to stomach it. It'd be like stabbing him. There's no solution, it's useless. There's no solution... There's no solution. It's useless, I'm in a blind alley in a tunnel. He'll kill himself, he's totally dependent on me. Hi, Cristian, it's Kadija, how are you? Me too. What I wanted to tell you? Oh, right. - Maria's got someone else. - What...?! She fell in love. Well... she fell in love. What can you do...? It happens! Bye, Cri'. See you! - Well? What did he say - What could the poor guy say? He'll come around. - Got that, but what did he say? - He said: "Alright". "Alright"?! What d'you mean "alright"? - Then what? - Then, nothing. He's an intelligent guy, young... He'll come around. It won't be the end of the world! He'll come around... it won't be the end of the world for sure! That's that! You've got a different culture, a different mentality. You see things more clearly, ampler, more... I don't know... Can it be those huge open spaces in Africa that... .. change the perspective? The contact with nature, the sunsets, the jungle, the deserts, the mirage... I don't know! Heil, Caesar, we who are about to die salute you! - Up your ass! - To me?! I'll kill you... Fucking bitch! Fucking... bitch. What're you doing, drinking alone? Better alone than in bad company. What have you done? You got hurt? - I'm sorry. - Thanks. Here, have a drink from this. - Your health! - And your grandpa's! "Cock" Here ere some names, my son, we call the prick: The chair, the yard, the nail, the kit, the cock, The Holofernes, rod, the sugar rock, The dickory dickory dock the liquorice stick The lusty Richard or the listless Dick, The old blind man, the jump on 12 o'clock, Mercurial finger, or the lead-fill'd sock, The monkey, or the mule with latent kick. The squib, the rocket, or the roman candle, The dumpendebat or the shagging shad, The love-lump or the hump or the pump-handle, The tap of venery, the leering lad, The handy dandy, stiff-proud or a-dandle, But most of all our Sad Glad Bad Mad Dad. And I might add That learned pedants burning midnight tapers Find Phallus, apt for their scholastic papers, And one old man I know calls it Priapus. His wife has no word for it but a sigh... A sign that Joy has somehow past her by. This was written 170 years ago by Giuseppe Gioacchino Belli: "The Father of the Saints"! There also is the mother of the nuns but... let's forget it! - No need, it's on the house. - Ah! Thanks. You know, sir... My father was a migrant too. In the '50s, in Belgium. In the mines. And he remained there. Last year, I went there on a pilgrimage, with all my family. At Marcinelle. Did you know there's a stone with the names of the 265 miners? 165 of them were Italians, and my father was among them. Listen, please... The bathroom, please? The bathroom is gone. Kaputt! Ah-ah. - Milosh, will you wash the floor? - Floor? Floor, come on! Floor! Listen, would you mind finishing it outside? - We must wash the floor. - Ok. Thanks. No, sir, there's no need. I won't wash the floor at this hour. Milosh, after! - Potem? - Potem, come on! I was saying that for that guy. The clients see him and stay out. And they go on bringing them here, in Italy by the hundreds, by the thousands, without any papers. Of course they'll then steal, rob, rape and bring all kind of diseases! Louses, for one. They were gone from Italy, they had been exterminated! There's an outbreak now! Did you see how that guy was covered in scabs? Then he got out of his pocket that 5 euro note, all creased: I wouldn't touch it. What else?! He then wants to go to the bathroom?! Of course you can't go! There's a note: "Out of order"! Can't you read? - But, if you need, sir, please, go ahead. - No, no, thanks. The bathroom is fine. I hang the note only for them. Good morning, Mrs. Sandrelli! Hi, Franco! It's time, we should be going. Come here, handsome! Bye, love. Granny has got to go to work now. Bye. - Bye, grandma! - Bye! - Bye! - Bye, grandma! Bye, grandma! - Bye! - Your leg... Bye! Say bye. Bye, grandma! Bye! - Madam, today's scene. - Thank you. "Gabriele, you know these are lies, how can you believe an anonymous letter?" "Gabriele, you know these are lies..." "Gabriele, you know these are lies..." "Gabriele, you know these are lies..." 75! 7-5. 55! 60! 6-0. 32! 19! 21! - I'll check grandpa's card. - If he wins, we split it. 17! 43! 28! 8! 59! 72! 7-2 4! Bingo! They said: Bingo. We're checking it. - Card 158. - We're checking card 158 for Bingo. Numbers: 1, 4, 19, 21, 22, 31, 41... - Yes? - "46, 53, 60, 65, 67, 79, 85, 88. We have a Bingo. Any other Bingo? We're closing the game. Yes? Yes? I'm Padella. Mario Padella. Yes. Write me down with 50 euro on Merda Secca? Place, yes. Hello? Eh! Card, yes. 14-44 / 23-27 / 42-69. 6-9, correct. That's right. Thanks! Bye, bye. Next game with cards selling from 1,50 euro starting with number 301. - How many cards, guys, two? - One. - Hello? Hello? I can't hear you! - Padella, how many cards? - Ten. - Yes! No, I couldn't hear. Where am I? - And you, ma'am? At the supermarket. I'll be right there. Heat the water for the pasta in the meantime. No, the beefsteaks were 20 euro the kilo, I bought eggs. Eggs! Eh! Yes, yes... Right away? That's just a word! There's a big queue. Be patient. Yes. I'm paying now, I'll be right there! We're beginning, gentlemen. You bet 2 euro the first number is between 20 and 30? - Make it four! - Alright. First number. 61! Six... one. 58! When I was studying architecture and the police came hitting us, we just ran. In '77 we had organized better, but I was pregnant with her. How could I run? They always caught me! At least once a month I ended up in Rebibbia, so I named her Rebibbietta. Mon, dad. We have great news. Me and Saib we're expecting a child. - Ugo! - Hi... May I? I was surprised! Come in. - May I? - Yes. - You're looking great... - I? You're looking great... Like a flower. - Michele, Ugo came to see you! - Who? Ugo! He's just come from work. Take a seat. He's taking a shower. It's a little cold today... I brought you these... Mont Blanc. The kind you liked so much! You've remembered! Thanks. I'm on a diet. On a diet?! Have you gone mad?! If you are on a diet, all the others... - What brought you? - Hi. I wanted to know how she... you are. - I'll make you a coffee. - Yes. How could we be?! House and work! - Like everyone. - Not everyone! I, for one, I'm only at home. Home and home. - Meaning? - I got fired. How come? That's not possible! Why? "Due to physical unfitness to merchandise handling". That's what they said. Me and nine other redundants! In your opinion, is that a just cause for firing? Well? If you couldn't handle the merchandise anymore, why should they keep you?! What's that got to do? They should've put him in another department. - Sure... You still think about fixed jobs - That's right! I opened a lawsuit anyway! Well done, that's all you know... - Listen... - Michele! - Michele, look what Ugo brought! - What, fritters? No, Mont Blanc. Good! Not you, Ornella, you're growing an ass like a suitcase! Hello? Is that you, Mario? No, no, no, no, haven't called her yet. No, I haven't called her yet! No, no, a little nuisance. My wife's husband dropped by. A poor devil, lonely like a dog... Anyway, that's the price for the motor. 800 euro. I changed the throttle bodies... No, no, I won't go lower. No, Mario, no... It's useless insisting. It's new! Well... if not I'll be keeping it. I'll keep it! Not many people, poor guy! At first, me too I didn't want to come! In the beginning I don't notice it. Then, the rumour becomes a murmur. The murmur a soft conversation among hollow voices. Like if the interlocutors had put one head over their mouth. It's then that I start listening carefully. There's no doubt, the voices come from the graves. So what? Judging by its coarseness, this is the voice of an ordinary man. - So what! - It's disgusting lying next to this shopkeeper. - Why did they drop you in here? - They put me in here against my will. I who, when alive, I'd have never spoken to you, I'm forced to lie near you because my husband only paid a 3rd category tax! I've recognized your voice! You owed me money. That's enough! Don't talk to me anymore! As you wish, ma'am. - He's obeying her even here. - Why shouldn't he? Let's hear. Doesn't Your Excellency know things are different here, from the world we left? - How do things go here, then? - There are no duties, and no classes. We always need a certain social order, a certain distance! These voices, partly, consoled me. If there's no friendship in this lugubrious underground, what can you ask from the upper floor? I'll go on listening. Boboc, boboc, boboc! That's a nice corpse. A philosopher, maybe, a gambler. He goes on whispering, a meaningless word. Boboc, boboc, boboc! I'm in here because of a cursed complication. This is a newcomer's voice, a handsome young man! I died a sudden death. On the evening before, the head doctor said: "Don't fear any complications". - The next morning, she was gone! - Should've gone to the county hospital! Should I go to the local, or the county hospital? Now... My dear, sweet young man! I already love you! Why didn't they put you next to me? - This angle is so bourgeois and dull! - I think so too! Tell me, Your Excellency... No, no, I'm not talking to you, General. I was talking to the Councilor. When you died, you left the State short of hundreds of millions. - There was no inquiry. - I won't contradict you. If you knew the misfortunes I eased... And here's my reward! At least, in here I found some rest, some happiness. Happiness?! Maybe because you smelled the presence of the young secretary... - Who are you talking about? - The young girl in the grave next to you. - I protest energetically! - Silence! One can't have peace not even in one's own grave! Nobody gives orders in the grave and, then, we couldn't care less about you. - Don't you forget, sir... - Not a bit scared. - You're a general up there... here you're puah. - I'm not puah! You're on the way! What'll be left of you? Six copper buttons. I've served my country! I've got a sword! - You can joust with graveyard mice. - Can't understand what good swords are. The sword, gentlemen, is one's honour! Boboc, boboc, boboc! You must have noted that, even afterwards, like in the life we left, we'll be spending our time speaking nonsense. But, most of all, it's that word that struck me: "boboc"! I don't know why, but those two syllables sound obscene and scary. "Boboc". I'm coming from Verano, you know? For the father of one of my friends. That is more than a friend, a colleague. Someone I share the office with at work. I felt I had to and I went. It's not at all that sad! I mean, it's not a gay place, but it's... .. there's calm, serenity Everything's so quiet. You know why? Because time doesn't matter there. Time influences not only... haste, calm, or waiting. No, no, time influences everything, even... kindness, badness... .. happiness, sadness, hope. - Don't touch. - I'm sorry. All those things don't exist without time. One has to give them a deadline. There's nothing without time, no life, no regrets. That's why there's so much calm there. Did you know dead talk among themselves? They really do! That's no highbrow concept, they talk, like we do! More or less like we two do! Maybe more like me, than like you. You don't believe me? I assure you. I heard them with my own ears. We chat to kill time, they do it to kill the lack of time. Are you free tonight? I guess you're not... I'm getting down here. I'll be... taking a walk. Got time anyway! Only for today, and only for this show... .. let's our Vapor steam cleaner. Absolutely fabulous. Sets your plants free from dust... Cut! What's the matter? Madam? Can you hear me? Come on! I won't buy the clothes! You took your pension, where is it? I don't have it. What do I know? Thousand... I paid a million for the boarding. - The usual, no? - Eh. - They're fleecing me! - They're fleecing you? - Whom to did you give the rest? - If I ain't got it, I ain't! What d'you want? - Shit! Why don't you believe me? - I can't believe that. You got angry? - Why don't you believe me? - Come on, sweetie! Why don't you believe me? Alright, I believe you, I believe you. Come on, that's alright! - Why don't you believe me? - That's alright. Why don't you believe me? - I do, I do... - You don't believe me! - But I do. - Alright, alright. - That's why... you're bad! - I am bad? - Yes, because you don't believe me. You're acting it. - Why don't you believe me? - Sure - Do yo believe me? - Not always! - Why? - Because you.. No, I... I always tell the truth, not lies. Eh... sometimes... Sometimes! I will now question three patients... .. and I'll evaluate their praxico-constructive ability, that is everything that goes by the name of Higher Cortical Functions, deficiency in which is an Alzheimer symptom. - I'll say some words. You repeat them. - Very well. So: dog... - Oh, I must... - .. house, cat. - Cat. - Repeat them. - So: house, cat... See, I've forgotten one word. So: house, bread, cat. - House, bread, cat. - Very well. Repeat with me the words I'll be saying. - House, bread, cat. - House, cat... bread, cat. What region of Italy are we in? We're in Sassari, Sardinia. We're in Sardinia. Tell me what year are we in. - We're in '26. - The year. - Yes. - I'll make a drawing and you copy it later. - Yes. - I'll do it here. - Yes. - This one? I made a small one. Should have made it bigger. I have to add that? - Draw everything. - Yes? Alright. Very well. Not so great. Are these drawings identical? No. - This one is more perfect. - I know, but... .. what are the differences? They are...? Can you see they're intertwined? They have a part in common. - Why did you draw them separated? - Well, I drew them separated. - Here? - No, there, bellow. Can you remember the three words I told you before? - No, I'm sorry. - Try. Make an effort. I really can't remember them... - Should have remembered them... - I'll say one, you the rest. - Dog. - Dog. - Can you remember the other two? - No. Bread, cat... It's strange today, but... I'm sorry. Can't remember them. - May I? - Come in. - Hi. - Hi. That's dad when he was drafted. He looked funny in that little hat. He looked funny in that little hat. - What's your name, sweet child? - Elisabetta, grandma. And here we are the two of us on the Janiculum. You were consoling me because my ice cream had fallen down. I met my husband on the Janiculum. He was following us, but didn't speak. - Here's grandpa Guglielmo: he was handsome! - Ah, Guglielmo! My husband's name was also Guglielmo. What's your name, sweet child? What's your name? - Make room! - What's the matter? - I don't speak with the likes of you! - Neither do I. - We'll be giving you three tonight! - In your dreams! - Hands off, dirty Juventus fan! - Shitty Roma fan! Shitty Roma fan?! You'll get it! Go to work, guys! Shut up, Championship! Watching the game together tonight? - Peut-être. - Peut-être. Alright, gimme a sign! Cameriere! Garcon! Kellner! Waiter from hell! You were waiting for the guard of honour? The triumphal march? - I'm waiting, sir. - "Waiting"? I'm waiting, you speak. What trash have you made today? Look at this... Oh, God... - I'll have chickpea soup. - Use your pen and notebook. Write it down, in Italian, if that's convenient. My son has chickpea soup, I'll have Bucatini all'amatriciana. Do you have it? It's that long pasta with a hole... - All'amatriciana. - All'amatriciana. -With gravy or plain? Plain, it's called Gricia, and with the gravy: Alla burina. You should have known that. - If you say so. - I say so? He even talks back! I'm waiting for your order. In silence! So: Bucatini all'amatriciana, with lots of pepper and guanciale. - You aren't using pancetta? - God forbid! - "God forbid"... - Only with guanciale. Sure, guanciale. And red wine. - House wine? - You drink your house wine! Together with the owner, the dish washers, the cook... You... from the house! We who eat here we want a '97 Amarone. - Dad, but... - "But" what? But... The pipe, the amatriciana, the red wine... - Do you want to die? - I want you to mind your business! Yes, I want to die! Didn't you take me here for my last wish? For second course: fritto misto, brain, artichokes, fried salt cod filet... and Fiori di zucca! - And now... to the hospice! - It's not a hospice. - No?! - It's not a hospice, dad. - What is it then? It's a nice place, hospitable and quiet. And, then, I only went there to see it, we'll decide later. - I think that you, who detest confusion.. - Who detests confusion?! You detest confusion, not I! I think you'll find yourself very well there. He says I'll be fine! But they don't know why they're sending me away. Dad, don't do this, please! Haven't we talked about this? Ours is a small house there're three children, and small for that matter. They'll kill you! I'll kill them, sons of a bitch! D'you know what they do? They have fun annoying me every day. They'll be sad when I'll be leaving. - They'll come and see you. - No, you must swear to me they won't! - Alright, they'll come only if you wish. - I won't wish it! - Is it because I roughed the concierge? - Of course not! I didn't set the garage on fire. It's not that. Because I pissed into the vases of the lady downstairs? You have no idea what that whore says about me! Listen, dad, a provocateur can't be touchy. You have to make up your mind: the one or the other! The other night, when that cop brought me home, I told you I wanted to end everything, to let you free, you and the kids. - A dip into the Tiber, and bye. - You tortured us until 3 am. - It wasn't true. - What?! I had forgotten the address home. The cop asked for my identity card, looked and then... It's worse every day. Every day: I forget everything. One day I lose a... .. a memory, a friend... .. a tooth... - Can I ask you something ma'am? - Of course, please do. - Why do you want to look like an old whore? You were one? - Dad! - How dare you?! You must be mad! - Excuse him, ma'am, he's not feeling well. - Lock him up, then! - They've already thought about that, ma'am It's shameful! Humiliating a poor old man, that's what's shameful! The poverty... .. was so dire, we were so hungry... .. I was a twelve years old kid... .. and then, to save my life, I had to learn German. Grandpa loves you too. That's how I learned so many games, to save my life too... I played gioco del tappo. One of the many games Like now, watch carefully, I'll make it disappear. Watch it, watch it... Where is it? - Here. - No! It's here! When... .. the buccaneers looked towards the command deck... .. they saw the corsair covering his face with his hands.
