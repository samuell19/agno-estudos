The events of this movie take place in Southern Georgia, a country that, until the end of the 21st century, was governed by the Ottoman empire. The Way Home Written by: Rekhviashvili, Ahulidiani, Kveselava Where?s Antimos, girls? I don't know, mom. And you don't know either? I don't... Go take have a look in the house. Antimos! Antimos! He's not here either. Antimos! Let's go look. Where does he disappear to? Where does he go? He's not here either. How can you go far from home during times like these? Oh calm yourself, he knows what he's doing. What're you looking at? What do you want? Are you following me? Why did you circle the church two times alredy? Stalking? Three of them are walking around here... Have you seen them? Wait. Don't go. I?m the only one left from my village. Others either fled, were kidnapped, sold... some were killed. Fear is what saved me. Fear doesn't let you stand still. There's the three of them! Save yourself! Antimos... Antimos. Let me go! Let go! Let go! Reads poetry by Dante Alighieri "Of the Lady Pietra Degli Scorvigni" My life, or feed like beasts upon the grass, Only to see her garments cast a shade. How dark so'er the hills throw out their shade, Under her summer-green the beautiful lady Covers it, like a stone cover'd in grass. Things were better before... There were plenty of people in the dungeon. Different times. Only smart people these days. Yeah... Not enough fools these days. Where are they? What do those fools need anyway? They're the ones that should be chasing us! Telling us to... Sell them. What are they going to do on this desolate land? You could at least earn some money there, if you tried. Of course! A person must be happy on easter. Let us drink! For our brothers, and our brotherhood. A captive is a captive. You shouldn't look him in the eyes. A man can start to adore his cattle, and then he won't be able to butcher it. That's the story here: either you sell or are sold yourself. I'm very happy on this day. Dear Lord, please forgive us and help us. Which God are you talking to? God is the same for everyone. I wonder how much they'll give us for these small fry. That last kid... He'll go well. The wine is finished. Whats the matter, Luka? Drink, drink. He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me Why do we have to suffer? Just let them all go... ...and that's that. Let them go, eh? Take some food to the dungeon instead. It's a celebration for them today too. Why me? Let the youngest among us take it. What happened? What happened Luka? I let them go. Let them go? Why did you do that? I don't know but I did. Luka! Where do you think you're going? Come back! Luka! Stop! Come back here right now! Luka! Ruined our festivities. Poor kid. It's alright, today is easter. He will ascend too. Everyone's ran off. Now they'll get lost in the forest. Yeah. Why did you catch that pheasant? To admire it's beauty? Let it go. You can't go far on beauty alone. Understand that, will you? Understand. It's not enough that you torture that goat, dragging it everywhere with you. Oh yeah, thanks for reminding me. Just about time to milk her. You should be happy you don't have to drink this crap. Yeah... Now I can feel, how heavy the pheasant is. When a man is hungry, everything seems light. When he's full, everything's heavy. That's how man is made. You're right, you're right... Let him go, I tell you. It'll be easier on the both of you. Yeah. You're right. Let's hope easier on the both of us. The elephant is the tallest of all the animals. Even a camel, a tall animal, you'll agree, when put side by side next to an elephant would barely reach the elephant's hip. Anyway... an elephant's dimensions are incredible. When the camel stands beside it, its as though a puppy is standing next to a bull. African camels have only a single hump. All the other camels that live in Central Asia- Someone is coming. Who is it? Didn't think to meet another person here. Hail. Where are you from, and where are you headed? I'm lost, and looking for the way home. Looks like you really are lost. Where were you? I was caught. Caught? By whom? There were three of them. One of them let me go. You're probably hungry. Someone, give him something to eat. I'm not hungry. If it's alright, I'll stay with you. Maybe I'll find my way back. Stay. Your choice. We'll find your home too, don't worry. I'll give you some clothes. Should fit you just right. These are the clothes of a righteous man, put them on. You'll walk the rightous path. Turn around, will you? What's your name? Antimos. Thank God, everything's safe. I, Maharobeli Shoshita bought this book in the year 1307 In the year of the big harvest. We have to take these books with us. They contain everything that we need to help us. When the books of the wise and the holy are forgotten, then sorrow follows. Our ancestors knew this, and saved them for us for this very reason. Careful. All things, good and bad, come from books. But people have forgotten the books of the wise and the holy They all live by the books of liars. For whom does the bell toll in this forgotten land? Could they be calling for us? How much farther do we have to go? They say... that a sack of potatoes will see you to the border. Well then we must already be halfway there. What awaits us in the foreign land? Did they not make our own land foreign to us? Who are those people? Probably vagabonds of some sort. Look. They're coming towards us. What times do we live in, that every traveller is one we must be wary of. Soon an end will come to that. Are you also going to the Black Canyon? No, not there. Not there. What do you mean? They say everyone's gathering there. Gathering for what? We haven't heard anything. How have you not? They say everyone's gathering there to free our land. Then we'll come with you. Of course we're coming with you! This is our business too... of course we're coming. Where do you head, brothers? Where do you head, brothers? Where is your path headed, brothers? We carry this standard to the Black Canyon. They say everyone's gathering there to free our land. Legend says they've always won with this standard. You're going the wrong way. You have to go north, the Black Canyon is there. Come with us, we're also going there. We're going the right way. We know for sure. Brothers, you're headed towards the ocean, theres much water there. Be careful. Be careful! Grigol. Grigol. Grigol! Maybe he's not alive anymore? Grigol!! He must be gone then. Who are you? What do you want? It's me, Grigol, Ilya. Ilya! I don't hear too well. Speak louder. Louder! It's me, Grigol! Ilya! Ilya! What do you want, Ilya? Why have you come? I came for you Grigol. The time that you have waited for has come. People are gathering in the Black Canyon to rid our country of its enemies. The time that you have waited for has come! People are gathering in the Black Canyon to rid our country of its enemies! We're all going there. There are many enemies, and not enough people, Ilya. We're still going. Come with us! Come with us, come! Have you forgotten, Ilya? When the winds blow in the east it rains in the west. I don't understand what he's talking about. I don't understand what you're talking about! What happened to you, Ilya? Why did you become so young? He's completely mad. We're wasting our time, let's go, let's go. Let's go. Ilya, Ilya! The water is finished. Can you fill the bucket up for me? Ilya! Wait! Wait! There's no water, the bucket's empty! Wake up. What is it? What's wrong? The mule is gone... as are the books. Everything's gone. What do mean, "gone"? What are you talking about? They fooled us. Robbed us. Those two. Where did they go? Where do we look? How can one understand the intentions of a man? How do you know... when he's telling the truth? When he's lying? We should have brought those books to the people. It was our duty. We must find them. There is no other way. Yes, we must. Let's go in different directions, it'll be faster that way. You're right. We have to return those books. Well, let's go. Everything's going to be okay. Okay! Until we meet again. May God help us! Give me the seventh and third numbers. "Of fluctuations between good and evil in legends" Maybe he wants to prove that evil can become good, and vice versa. What is the book's number? The third. Idiocy. It's long since people should have understood: he who flees from evil to good must have one thing yelled at him as he's doing so. That neither good, nor evil, exists. What next? "Of doubt." Of doubt? Read for a bit, will you? Is fire hot? Is snow white? We must re-nalyze all assumptions that have come before us. Even spring water, if it is not renewed, will turn into a bog. Is fire hot? He will definitely know, when his books start to burn. Fire, snow. That's why everything must be studied and evaluated, and first and foremost it must be the dogmas that govern our day to day lives. Got it? Got it. Precisely why he will have to answer to those he doubts. That's what you get from liberal typography. Writes whatever he wants. Professes whatever he wants. Not only that. He sends his students everywhere he can. To spread his heresy. Let him spread whatever he wants in those places. We're not there. A harmful book is like an epidemic: it knows no borders. Who is he, anyway? Where is he from? This Antimos. There are no papers of his past. No one knows where he's from. Yet the people love him. Believe him. The further away that you are from your homeland, the greater you believe its limits are. That's more idiocy. People like him wish only to make the whole world their cattle. One homeland is not enough for their vanity. Greetings. Do not fear me. Where are you headed. They say that its much safer in other lands. That's where we're headed. What about you? First to my village. Then to the Black Canyon. They say people are gathering there. Gathering for what? To banish the enemy from our lands. God help them. Maybe something will help us. Come, you need rest, you're probably tired. These places are almost completely empty. We've been walking for a while now, and you're the first person we see. That's my daughter-in-law. Her husband was killed, the poor thing, and she's been silent since. Hello. The people that lived here before... Where are they? (They speak in an unknown language) Sounds like someone's coming. Who are you? What do you want? Look... It's the same one that ran off from us in spring. Yes... that's him. Come. So, tired of being free then? What do you want? Why did you come? I was home. No ones there. And now... I'm looking for my family. Why did you think they were here? Sit. It's getting dark. Time to eat. Time will pass and everything will be forgotten, trust me. When I lost my parents, I thought life was over. I can't even remember my mother's face now. Must be your fate. Ran away from us, and came right back. Let's drink for Luka. He freed you then, and paid for it with his life. Funny, that. Drink, drink. It'll be much easier. Most important thing now is for you to start doing something. Like helping us. Why not? Replace Luka. Almost like he gave you his spot with us. Don't worry, when you're with us, people will be afraid of you. Let's drink to our brothers, and our brotherhood. Dear Lord, please forgive us and help us. Which God are you talking to? God is the same for everyone. Don't worry. You'll be with us. People will fear you. What's there to fear? Nobody's responsible for anything in our times. What difference does it make? When we're gone, everything's gone. No. That's not true. Nothing is gone. Everything remains. And evil deeds will always be cursed? Good deeds always fondly remembered? Yeah, yeah, we know. We've been told. These are all stories of hypocrites, bookworms, liars. Conscience, honesty, love. I think you know something about my family. How? We don't leave the forest. A man will come tomorrow, he knows everything. Wait for him. Drink, it'll be cold at night. Take this to those in the dungeon, they've a long road ahead tomorrow. There's nothing to take, everything's eaten. Drink, drink. Come on now. Wake up, wake up. Get up, get up. So how are you here? How are things? What's new in the world? People are fleeing, running. North this time. Half of them will freeze on the way there. Shame. So many people just going to waste. How many souls do you have? Around nine. Why nine? Ten. You forget that kid yesterday? He alone is worth nine of them. Trusting guy. When he looks in your eyes... it's scary. How'd you catch such a rarity? We caught nothing, he came himself. So trusting. Didn't even fell me putting the shackles on him while he slept. Alright, let's not waste time. Let's go. Let's. We'll be rid of them sooner. Get up. Get up, time to go. Still asleep? He'll be so surprised when he wakes up. To remove Antimos' rights to any belongings... those belongings must first be catalogued. That's not too hard. His belongings didnt even manage to fill one chest. That's the problem. If they did... then snow would have been white, and fire would have been hot. Clay pitcher. One. Probably for holy water... Travelling clothes with hood. One piece. No idea what this is. A thin veil, black. One. Next? What else is there? That's it. Nothing else. He owned nothing, and so was afraid of nothing. What should he have feared, if he owned nothing? Well, looks like that's that. Now we can take everything to the ninth room. What's wrong, what's the matter? Here, some sort of order. What's written here? Were you not told? No... Nothing. Told me to give it to you, that's all. We don't know how to read. You read it. How will I read? I don't know how to. Let me take a look. Let uh... what's his name... Antimos read it. Yes, yes. Let him read it. Couldn't think of that right away, could you? Here, take it. It's written here... That we must kill him. Kill? Kill who? Him. Antimos. It's written there that we have to kill him? He said that himself? Yes. I don't get it. He could have just said that we had to let him go. How would we have known? What if he's trying to fool us? Ruin us? Yeah, that must be it. Tricking us. What tricking? If you were to be released, you wouldn't say you should be killed. Yeah, who would? That's what I'm thinking. Of course he told the truth. They wouldn't have sent me this far with an order. Why didn't he lie to us. Why didn't he tell us we were to free him. I don't get it... What's there to get? If he said so himself. We'll follow the order and go back in our carts. Why walk? Come here. (Starts to do a counting game) Let's... look at... the grapevines. Who ate the grapes? Went... and saw... the grapevines. The goat ate the grapes. Let's... look at... the wolf. Who ate the wolf? Went... and saw... the wolf. The rifle ate the wolf. The rifle the wolf, the wolf the goat. The goat ate the grapes, let's look at the goat. Who ate the goat? I went to see the goat, but the wolf ate it! You messed up! Let's look at the wolf. Who ate the wolf? Went to see the wolf. The rifle ate the wolf. The rifle the wolf, the wolf the goat. The goat ate the- Damn it, me again. Who else? Alright, I'll be off.
