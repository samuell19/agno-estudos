Pang Noi, 1996 Before that day, we were the best of friends You said we should remain as friends But I had always hoped for something more And I gave it all away Stop saying I was too good for you Is that your reason? Don't say what you don't mean If you choose to go, at least tell me the truth Don't kill me with the words 'too good' Are you the new kid? Need a ride? August, 1996 Umbrella? It's raining. Hey! What are you doing? Put it away! Hey, I'm sorry. Like I said, no big deal. Get to the assembly. I'll go when you go. Suit yourself. I'm Dew, from Class 3. I'm Pob, Class 5. Pob. You can wear this for now. It's fine. I can wear it once it's washed. It's not fine. Your uniform's not exactly dry. Trust me. I said it's okay. I'll wash it for you. Now that you gave me your uniform, are you going to class dressed like this? Dew. Are you seriously wearing this to class? Yeah. Why? Just change to your gym clothes if you don't want Tanom chewing you out in dance class. Why would he? This is a uniform for sports. What kind of sports? Sports Day. Ready? And... go! One, two, three! One, two! Cool. Good morning, students. I've got an announcement to make. As nowadays, AIDS is becoming more common in our Pang Noi, especially among homosexual men, the district has asked us to organize a training session for students who are sexually deviant. For this, the school has invited psychiatrists and soldiers. Therefore, I urge sexually deviant students to come and register. Homeroom teachers and class representatives should help with the screening. Thank you. - What's your name? - Tanawat. The training sessions are very informative. Psychiatrists and soldiers are here to help you... Mom? Mom. I'm home. Oh! You're back! Want some oranges? Why are you dressed like that? What about it? What is that in the back? My friend's clothes. - Today I kinda... - I know. You hitched a ride and you fell. How did you know? Everyone knows about that. You crashed into someone's rice paddy. And what, you're offering to wash them? I'm not doing it for you. I'll do it myself. You never think about washing your own clothes. Unbelievable. I was responsible for the fall. I'm not listening. Mom! Get up early tomorrow and we go together. Here's tea. Pob, where's your uniform? My friend's got it ruined, so he offered to wash it for me. Does he know how to wash clothes? They may be better at it than you. Just eat. Dew, hurry up. Okay mom. Dew! Aren't you going home yet? Waiting for my mom. She's coming late. Need a ride? No, it's fine. On second thought, I do. Hold on a sec. Actually, I can't give you a ride. Then why did you ask in the first place? Common courtesy. Asshole! Sorry. Here's your uniform from last time. Are you in a hurry? Hold on a sec. I'm good. You? Going home. Still don't know how though. You said your mom's picking you up. I haven't decided. Why so serious? Get off. Go home. Quick. Hurry up! Move it. Go, go! Go home. Thanks. I'll be going now. Settle down. Mr.Tanom is occupied today, so is Ms.Kaew. So we will have a joint PE class today. You knew each other, yes? - Yes. - Okay. Thanom is not here. We're going to pair up. Boys pair up with boys, and girls with girls, so as not to violate our traditions. Ready? Pair up. You got a partner yet? Hi, Pob. Hi, Dew. Um... Got a partner yet? No. We'll be dancing Cha Cha Cha. For those who can dance, do so, those who can't, watch your friends. Music! So you're the girl? What? No! Of course I am. What will it be? I'm... I'm a guy dancing as a girl. Sorry. It's alright. Look at me. Why? When you look at my face, and look in the eyes, you'll catch the rhythm. Really? Sorry. For what? I brushed the collar too hard. Now it's all frayed. Never mind. By the way, I haven't returned your PE uniform. It's no big deal. Don't be serious. Give it back when you're done. My mom's put it in the bag. Totally forgot. Sorry for the late return. February, 1997 Sit down. Can I lie down? Guess what's in this picture. What is that? I don't know. There's a whale hidden in the picture. What? A whale? It's really in there. Do you want me to teach you? Sure. Lift your finger. And focus on it. Then shift your sight to the picture. See it now? Nope. Still can't see? So what is it exactly? There's a prawn hidden in there. Really? Tell me, between here and Chiang Mai, where do you prefer? Can't say. It's more civilized in the city, more stuff to do. So you don't like it here? It's not that I don't like it, maybe I haven't adjusted well enough. But don't worry about me. And you, do you want to go to Chiang Mai? March, 1997 All fixed. Queenstown, N.Z. You two at the back, stop playing. Before we end this class, I've got an interesting activity for you. A campaign from New Zealand Academy. What you have to do is find a Thai song and translate it to English. Make sure it sounds good. The winner gets a free trip to New Zealand. Pob. New Zealand! Bungee jump! It's tough stuff, man. Pob. Come on, take me to convenience store. Pob. Bungy jumps in New Zealand No way. I don't want to. Come on, give it a try. No. You can just give me a ride. Don't be stubborn. Listen, when I sleep at night, if you want to grab some food, you should ride out yourself. Come on. Here. Get ready. Put your foot on the starter. Now push down. Good. Harder. Harder. You okay? I'm fine. Push down more. Push again. Harder. Almost there. Come on. Don't be afraid. Hold on. Right. Ready? One, two, three. Go! Take it easy. Are you alright? It's okay. Let's try... Enough, Pob. I'm okay with you taking me. Why do you keep forcing me? Sometimes I am tired and I want to sleep. But you keep dragging me out of bed. It's nothing. Can't you do this for me? Just giving me rides? Can't you just learn to go out on your own? You keep dragging me out every night. You're not letting me catch a damn wink. I'm tired too, you know. If you're tired, get lost! Why are you here? How can you say that? Is this what you want? Get lost! You said it. It's okay. Right? I'm not mad. See? I'm happy to announce the winner of the New Zealand trip. Krittapob. A round of applause for him. Congratulations. Pob? - Come on. - Pob. Come out and show your work. You should go ahead. Very good. Come on. I'm so proud of you. Come on. - Where is Pob? - I don't know. Pang Noi, 0 km May, 1997 Hey Pat, you can sit here. How are ya, man? Cleaning staff: Krittapob, Chanut, Suppakit, Dech, Patumthip. Did others skip cleaning duty? Asshole Pob. Not talking to me? Dickhead. What the fuck are you doing? You won't talk to me. Why won't you talk to me? What do you expect? It's you... who made me to expect. I don't know. But no matter what's between us, it is impossible. Can't we be just friends? Can you really think of me as a friend? What about my dad and the whole school? They don't have to know. Dew, this is Pang Noi. You think they have no idea what we are? We can get away from here. Start over somewhere else. Enough. I'm not like you. What do you mean, you're not like me. Answer me. What's wrong with being like me? What do you mean? Like me? I don't want to be despised like you. I just want to be like everyone else. You asshole! You think I really want to be like this? Dew? Dew, cut it out. According to eyewitnesses, they say Dew started a quarrel. I would like to know what the trigger is. Pob was the one shouting at Dew that I don't want to be despised. I don't want to be like you. Why would you be despised? Say what you have to say. I'm going home. Mom... If I'm like this, would you still love me? What the hell is wrong, Pob? Why won't you fight back? A faggot hit you. Shame on you. Enough, Pa. - Where's your honor? - Enough! You're a disgrace. Now the whole school knows what you are. I thought you knew already. I kinda guessed. But they just didn't say it out loud. There were rumors you forced Pob to have sex, and Pob didn't want to, hence the fistfight broke out. Faggot! Drop dead! Slut! Did you tell others I forced you? I didn't. The teacher must have assumed things and spread the word. You know what happened to my life? I'm sorry. I can't go back to the way things were. I know. Then why the fuck do you want to see me? What do you want from me? Give me your wallet. Why? Just give it. Are you robbing me? Just give me, dammit. They say the military camp just checks your student ID. I'm going in your place. It's like punching in for your friend. You're crazy. Why would you do this? You don't have to go. As long as we're together, whatever we are, I'm fine. Get out of the car! Go home! I think we should run away. Where will we go? Anywhere, away from Pang Noi. We'll catch a train out of here, go wherever it takes us, get off where we feel like it. What would our families say? About what we are? Do they still see us as their sons? Pob! Get over here. Pa! Pa, calm down, take it easy. My friend at the camp told me you went for treatment. What does that mean? Who sent you there? Last time, you didn't stand up to him, and now you're taking his place. Did he force you to do this? You've brought shame upon your own family. You disgrace. Pa, he's been through a lot already. Don't you take his side. You raised a coward. He couldn't even fight a faggot. I'll beat his sorry ass to hell. Fight me! How could you do this to me? You want to be a faggot like him? Enough! Stop it, fucker! Pob, what have you done? This is our old man. He told me to fight. You really wanna know why? The reason I went in Dew's place? You can't handle the fucking truth. Pob, watch out what you say. I have nothing to say to you. Shove it up yours and die. Don't go, son. Don't call him son. He's not my son anymore. If you take a step outside, we're through. Pob! Pob! Come back! You're right. We should leave this place. There's still last train tonight, at 11:30 pm. Let's go together. From, Pob. What are you doing? We need to talk. What are you and Pob? We're friends, mom. And where are you two going? Give me back my pager and I'll tell. Now can you tell me? Where are you two going? Anywhere but here. Why? Do you even need to ask? Can you answer me then, if this is what I am, will you still love me? Of course I will. I'll love you no matter what you are. It's just you and me. What would I do without you? Be whatever you want to be. But please, don't leave this place. Can I really be what I want to be? You just signed me up to the treatment course. Are you planning to get me expelled? Can you take it? I'll do whatever it takes. This is all I ask of you please don't leave. You can love any other men in the world, but if there's one woman you love, please let it be me. Please? Hello? What are you up to? Sorry, I was in the shower. How did it go for you? My Pa found out I went in your place. He disowned me. Are you for real? Yes. Once he found out what I was, I was no longer his son. I was thinking about leaving tonight. Please come with me. Isn't this too sudden? I think this is the best time. Not today, no. You mean you're not going? I'm sorry. But my mother's alone. If I leave, she has no one left. Hello, Pob? Hello? You said it yourself, that we'd be going together. But your mom said one word and you changed your mind? I got disowned, for fuck's sake! Everything I did, everything I gave up, it was to be with you. I'm sorry. Saying sorry doesn't change a fucking thing! Can you bring back what I'd lost? Pob, listen. Everything I did, just forget it. All the favors I gave you, it was out of pity. The train is arriving at Platform 1. Please beware of the approaching train. The train is arriving at Platform 1. Pang Noi, 2019 It's the first day, right? I'll be fine. What about you? No worries. Do your best. - See you. - Okay. Krittapob My name is Pob. I'll be your homeroom teacher for Class 4/3. And this is my first class here. Pleased to meet you all. If you have any problem with study, friends or your romance, feel free to talk to me. Don't be afraid. I am a former student here as well. In other words, I'm your senior. Come with me. First day of school in your 10th grade and you gave me the slip. Get in there. Mr.Pob! This is Liu, better keep an eye on her. She's been trouble since last year, sneaking out to mess around with seniors. Greet him properly. You're a teacher. Don't forget to check attendance. What's your name? Natcha Premparama You're a teacher. Not a friend, not a senior. Start acting like one. Don't be lenient. If they don't fear you, you can't keep them under control. And if you can't control them, you won't pass your evaluation, and you won't be able to teach. Understand? Yes, ma'am. Get that girl Natcha under control. Show me you're ready to be a teacher. Yes, ma'am. Hey Pob. How was school today? Good, it changed a lot. Do you remember Ms.Ratchanee? - She's my boss. - For real? If you can't stand her, you can come work with me. What? Are you seriously asking him to work for you? He'll screw up your business. He failed his own back in Bangkok and just came back. I'm serious though. Can you handle being a teacher? Of course I can. The students might be a handful though. That's not what I meant. I meant the salary. Is it really enough? You're just a temporary teacher. Did they tell you when you'll get full-time job? Not yet. See? And what about your house loan? When will you be able to pay that back? Come on, with two of us working, it's not gonna take long. Right, Pob? May I come in, teacher? You were looking at the old pictures. A toast, for old time's sake. Just a little. Let me see. Oh... Cute smile. Old friend. You two were close? Lots of pictures. Quite close. Where is he? You've never introduced him to me. Is he around? Not anymore. Let's go. Nattakit. Natcha. Natcha? Whoa. You're good. Do it again. Do it again. How did you... Oh, crap! Wait! Wait! Wait. Wait! You there! I said stop! Stop! Stop! Hey stop! Here, wear this. Heck no. Whose is this? It's mine, put it on. You look inappropriate. What about it? Take it. No. As if you are appropritate. No, you keep it. This ain't cool. Ain't cool? Just put it on. You look pitiful. Will you make it to class in time? If we hurry. Get going then. What are you waiting for? Yes, ma'am. Pob, where are you going? Let Natcha go to class, you're the teacher. I forgot. I hope there's a better way to deal with this. Next time. Yes, ma'am. What are you doing here? Your place is on my way, so I'm taking you to school. Don't bother. I can go myself. Actually, I didn't want to be here, but Ms.Ratchanee insisted I take you to class. What does that hag want with me? Come on, I'll give you a lift. No, I'm going myself. No, you won't. Yes, I will. No. Yes. No. Yes. Why are you living in a dorm? I'm not from around here. Where are you from then? Chiang Rai. You're not afraid of living alone? Nothing to be afraid of. I won't be here long anyway. Where will you be going? Anywhere but here. This is not where I belong. I think you just haven't found the good things here. If there were good things here, how come you left to Bangkok in 12th grade? Wait... How did you know about me? You're new here. Everyone is talking about you. True. My friend and I thought exact same thing too. Right? There's nothing in Pang Noi. The town's small. Everyone knows about everything. And where do you want to go? Bangkok, Chiang Mai... Anywhere but here. You should at least finish school. Are you serious? It's 3 more years till I finish. I'll go crazy first. What did you say? I'm in 10th grade now, 3 more years to go. No, before that. Serious? Why? Hello, Top. Mr.Pob's picking me up. He's been talking with me nonstop since we got in the car. I'll see you at school. Bye. Top from 12th grade? Boyfriend? Sir, none of your business. Okay. I'll go to class when it's time. Good morning, Mr.Pob. You mad? Serious? By March 25th, please make the following payment: 500K THB Wattana. Kobkul. Natcha. Over here. Why did you change seat? That desk got scratches, it's hard to write on it. Every desk has scratch marks. I don't want to sit at that desk. I feel uncomfortable. It's not serious if I change the seat? Not serious. Sit anywhere you want. Thank you. Hi, everyone. Turn to page 57. Picking up from last time... There is one more thing to do before you get your evaluation. What do I have to do? Take your class to participate in any activity. Go to a contest or something and get some results. But... You've done well in other aspects so far. Especially looking after Natcha. Other teachers say her behavior and grades have improved a lot. Only you could have done that. Right. Make sure you do well on the participatory activity. Liu, you haven't been going out with us lately. And you haven't even touched the sausage I bought for you. I told you many times to get some vegetables. What vegetables? There's a salad coming along with ths sausage. They stopped giving free vegetables ages ago. You're joking. You just don't remember. You're just making a lame excuse, isn't it? It's not an excuse, I just want to read. There isn't... Enough. Hello. Hey Natcha. Can I have a word? - Follow me. - You can talk here. Sure. Are you interested in a science competition in Chiang Mai? Me? Yes. You have a pass grade. Would you like to go to Chiang Mai? Have you been in Chiang Mai before? Don't think so... if I remember correctly. If you remember correctly? It feels familiar somehow. Thanks. Name the longitudinal waves. - Sound wave. - Spring wave. Liu. Liu? Yes? What are you thinking about? Why don't you answer? What was it again? I asked, name the longitudinal waves. Get that memorized. Lend me your car keys. I'm going out with my friends. Drive safe. Don't wait up, I'll be home late. Good night. Now then... Name all the S.I. units. Something wrong, Liu? Get some rest. I don't know what's wrong. I just couldn't focus. Want some fresh air? You'll feel better. You gave your car key to Mrs.Orn. Here. They don't give free vegetables with the sausages anymore. Oh really? Where did you get them? It's not that hard. Plenty of other stalls. Do you visit Chiang Mai often? Not really. When I was young, I came to study in cram school. A guy like you went to cram school? I'm not that smart, to be honest. I was just lucky my friend saved me. He dragged me to study during vacation, which led me where I'm now. He must be very important to you. He was. He really was. So where is he now? Nearby, I guess. Aren't you going to visit him? I don't think he would recognize me. He would if you're important to him. Liu, let me ask you a question. Do you believe in reincarnation? Don't know... I just think... Maybe, there just may be another me, in another time, something like that. Why are you asking me this? You're a science teacher. I just believe that people come across each other for a reason, or maybe it was destiny. Fuck, I'll fail the first round for sure. Okay. I was just asking. You remind me of someone. Sir, Mrs. Orn is a good person. No, I didn't think of you that way. Neither did I. I'm just doing my best to take care of you as a teacher. Is that so. Yes. Thank you then. Likewise. Congratulations to all who won the awards today. Please come up for a commemorative photo. Why are you teary-eyed? Come on. It's nothing. Don't cry now. You guys can go ahead. I'll find a way back myself. You came with the school, is that okay? I'm really going home. My friend's here. I'll be going now. Today Ms.Angkana won't be able to teach. She gave you some homework from the last class. If you're done with it, hand it in. Thank you. Where's your homework? Dude, who's calling Liu? Where is she? What took you so long? And who are you, fucker? Can I talk to Liu? Hold it. I said who are you? It's Mr.Pob. Who is it? What is it? Where are you? I'm on a mountain hike with my friends. You should have handed in Ms.Angkana's homework. Ms.Angkana's homework is due Monday. Today's Friday. Why are you in such a hurry? Whatever. Just reminding you that this assignment is important. I know. Anything else? Nothing. I'm going back to my friends, okay? What did you talk about? Nothing much. I said what did you two talk about? And I said nothing much. Don't you fucking walk away from me. That hurts! I'm sorry. You seem... distant lately. Ever since that Mr.Pob came, I got... I told you, I don't think of him that way. What about him? Word got around, you went riding with him in Chiang Mai. I thought I'd keep this quiet. You already slept with him, didn't you? Top! Liu! Top, easy! I didn't sleep with him. If you want to believe them, go fuck yourself. Calm down. Let me go. Hold it. Why are you late? - I got up late. - I wasn't asking you. Don't interrupt, mind you manners. So? Why are you late? I was waiting for Top to pick me up. Natcha, start 20 squats. Nattakit, 50 push-ups. Start. Liu, don't. I'll do her part too. I picked her up late. Fine. Keep going until I say stop. As for you, go to class. You'll be late. Go. Now then... One, two, three. I've read your song translation homework. And I've selected the best piece for our class today. Natcha, number 48. Where are you? Come out. Come on! Quickly! Come out. Here. This is a very old song. And the meaning is beautiful. How did you know about this song? My dad used to listen to this when I was a kid. Would you please explain the lyrics to the class? Give her a round of applause. Why are you doing this? What did I do? You shouldn't have done that. If you flunk this class, you'll repeat the grade. And you... won't be able to leave this town. You know what others are saying about us. What if they found out you did my homework? Who would know? You didn't think she would ask me to recite it? What if I couldn't recite it? But she said you did well. You knew every word of the song. What do you want? My friend once translated this song for me. It led me to a better life. But it was my fault that he had to go through bad things in his life. I wanted to repay the debt to someone who resembles him. This has to end. I just want to be like everyone else. Why is Dew's house empty? Dew died a while back. Didn't you know? He died over a year ago. Car crash. The same day you ran away from home. I remember it well. There were rumors he was running away with you. Is that true? Of course not. That's what I thought. He might be riding out to buy dinner for his mom. This place is called Pha Daeng. Whenever I feel down, I come to this place. It's beautiful, especially when the sky is clear. It's good that you have beautiful place where you belong. Me, I don't belong anywhere. Why not? My mom keeps moving around. Civil servant stuff. I'll bring you back here someday. March Dew - Pob Now you're a full-time teacher. Yes, ma'am. But it comes with greater responsibilities. You are aware, right? I am. From now on, you don't have to babysit Natcha. I'm assigning you to another group instead. I think you'd be doing a great job. Rules are not made to be broken. Go! Quickly now! Stay still or I'll cut your ear. Stay still. Go get a proper haircut. Respect the rules. Your nails are too long. Get it properly cut. Next. Wait. You got a problem with me? Hey! You don't have to be rude. I'm just getting you for a haircut. My hair... grows on my head. Why does it bother you? It's a school rule, and you're a student, you should obey the rules. Stupid rules. Why do I have to? I'm a teacher, have some respect. Teacher? I know why you're always on my ass. What do you want? Let's go, Top. I can take you to get a haircut. Stay out of this, Liu. Hey! Let's go. I said stay out of this. Hey! How's that? You think you're a big shot? Don't think I'll back down just because you're a teacher. Turn around and fight me. I'm really curious if a wimp like you knows how to fight. You want to fight? Stop. Break it up! Stop! You're a teacher. Even if the student started, you cannot fight back. You can be fired for things like this. I disagree. You should know what kind of student Top is. There should be more appropriate ways. How? How can you deal with delinquents like him? If his parents decide to press charges, we're in trouble. What if he has a weapon? Can't a teacher act in self-defense? It depends on who started the fight. Natcha, can you answer me now? Who started it? Today I got a student expelled from the school. I would have been fired too, but Ms. Ratchanee vouched for me. Is there anything I can do for you? Nah. You get some sleep. I'd like to be alone. Liu. Let's talk. Why did you do that? Because it's wrong. But you should be on my side. I don't understand myself. If I'm not the same person you knew, would you still love me? Do you love me? I want to. I want an answer for this pic. Can you come? Where did you get this? Where are you? Pob, where are you going? Something came up. What is it? I'm not going to pry. But I'm asking you this one time. Can you stay with me tonight? Do your best today. Okay. Sorry I couldn't go to see you. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Are you home yet? Liu. Liu. Do you know these people and these songs? Yes, some feels familiar. Can you see these magic eye pictures? Just some of them, for some, I can't see anything. This one's a prawn. And this, a pigeon. This one's a whale. You taught me how to look at these pictures. I actually figured out since that day. But I pretended not to know, so that we could keep talking. This one, you didn't tell me the answer. But I knew what it was. Back then, I just couldn't say it. It was impossible, we both knew it. I know you're still in here. There are so much things that we couldn't do. Let me make it up to you. It really is you, Dew, right? You pervert, say hi to everyone. Top, stop it! That's for getting me expelled. And this is for you. Liu, I'm sorry, are you alright? You get back to Mrs.Orn. But... Go! Is Orn here? She just went out. I'm sorry, the number you have dialed cannot be reached at this time. Orn! Orn! Orn! It's not what you think. Stop it, Pob. It's too late to explain this. Orn! I'm sorry. I'm not mad at you. You've been through a lot. I'm not mad at all. One day, when we meet again, I hope we'd both be happier. Pob. I saw the video. Right. I remember your best friend Dew. You do? I can always remember my pupils. You and Dew were... Don't let your wound from the past hold you back from growing up. Even with a teacher? There comes Miss Easy A. What a slut. Are you here, Dew? I've got something to tell you. I'm sorry, for all the bad things that happened, for all that I've put you through. I'll try, Dew. I'll try to grow up, to be free of my own guilt. But if it means forgetting you, I don't want it. You are the only good memory I had in my life. Why am I crying for you? I bought you some sausages, along with some vegetables. Nowadays it's hard to find free vegetables. I've got you loads though. Enjoy the food. And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again. Sky? Why do you think it's the sky? Because it's blue? This one's a pigeon. Close enough. This is the last one. I know you can see it. I knew what it was. It was impossible, we both knew it. I'll bring you back here someday. Liu? What's the matter? Let me borrow your bike. Liu? You know how to ride that? Liu! What the...? Pob. I'm wondering what lies ahead. Where have you been? I don't know. It felt like a dream. Waking up from long sleep and find yourself a new person with no past memories. Did it come back to you since Chiang Mai? Just a bit. But you were married. I didn't want to ruin your family. What about Top? I guess we both screwed up. Yeah. Come sit over here. Soon, I'll grow old, and you'll grow up. You'll find someone who looks after you better than I did. I don't want to grow up. Me too. I could see the rainbow far away on the horizon We dreamed of climbing it to the end, so our wish could come true We made a wish and kept it a secret, waiting for the right time When we reached at the end of the rainbow, I'd tell you what I wished for Each day we climbed higher, as long as you smile, I would not faltered, but as the end was close to reach, I turned back to you and you were gone Careful. Don't get caught. Come on up. Okay, the gentleman can come over here, the lady goes there. Please spread your legs. It's not the end down there, is it? No. There's always a way.
