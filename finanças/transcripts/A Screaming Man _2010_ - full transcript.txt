I let you win before. I let you win! Champion! It's me the champ! I'm the champ! Abdel! Wait. You know, a pool attendant should always wear white. All my white t-shirts are dirty. The machine's broken. Hold it. Cheese! Stop fooling around! Come on, just one. You take photos every day. Why? To document my life. Your life. Come on. Careful, the boss! Come on now, put the mattresses out. Stretch your arms and bend your legs. Back this way now. Go, Lisa, go! Well done! Good, Lisa. Keep going. Go on, Lisa. Well done! I'm really worried. Why? About the war? About the hotel privatization. Don't worry. We've been working here for 30 years. They can't do anything to us. Come on, sit down. We'll be fine. Gardole! Gardole! Let me get you something to eat. Gardole, come! Here boy! There you go! Eat! Good dog! Watch out! You'll get us killed! This morning, patriotic organizations held a meeting in support of the government forces to say no to rebel attacks on the peaceful population. It took place at the N'djamena National Stadium. All worthy citizens of the nation were present. Tens of thousands of people attended the 2-hour meeting. United together in a collective, the patriotic groups condemn the incessant rebel attacks perpetrated throughout Chad. According to the collective's spokesman, the rebels are clearly a serious threat to the peace, the stability, and the country's development. For this reason, the patriotic organizations exhort the international community to stop delivering arms to the rebels. Hello! Hello. - Who is it? - Your new neighbor. The organizations are fully aware of their role and promise their unfailing support to the government forces and are ready to fight together to defend the country. Do you have any onions? Moreover, the collective's members salute the army's bravery and discipline. The government forces have managed to rout the attackers who have left hundreds wounded and killed dozens of men. The collective of patriotic organizations has also launched a solemn appeal for all peace-Ioving Chadians to mobilize and unite... Hi, Dad. Abdel! Where were you? What's going on? Nothing. Got troubles? No. If you have, you can tell me. You can trust me. I'm your father! Dark horse! Be off with you! - My buddy! - Champ! How's things? Why the long face? Bad news. Look. If I'd bet 2 instead of 12, I'd have all the numbers. You wouldn't listen to me! 4 million, the winnings! No! If I'd have won, bye bye barrier. Got any cola? Well? I've been fired. Good morning. How old are you, Adam? 54. No, sorry. 55. I often see you sitting on your chair. You take life easy. That's good! Mrs. Wang, you know, my son works very hard. And I'm the boss. I'm in charge. Do you really think we need two employees at the pool? You know, Mrs Wang, the pool's my whole life. I was Chad's first pool attendant. I was the central African swimming champion in 1965. David, call the work tribunal! Champ, David can't beat Goliath this time round. What'll become of you, David? I'm not dead yet, Champ. Life goes on... As we say back in Congo, "To be continued..." Our problem is that we put our destiny in God's hands. OK. Hold that. Like that, there. OK? Go and get the same and come back here. Got it? That was fun today! Really. Let's take a photo. Dad! What's up? What are you thinking about? About before. Before. Before what? Want a lift home? Abdel? Abdel! Yes? No, and I won't be back for dinner. Hi, Souad. Did Mrs. Wang want to see me? Did you see the boss? Yes. What did she say? What did she want? Well? Answer me when I'm talking to you! How are you, Champ? I meant to come to the meeting last night, but... But what? I'm disappointed in you. Really. Bernadette, a beer! You haven't paid your war contribution. You want the rebels to overrun the country? - It's not that, Ahmat. - Champ. Champ. The war effort is everyone's duty. Everyone has to help stop the rebels or we'll all be done for. You're not for them? Not at all, Ahmat! Call me Chief, like everyone else. Hello, Etienne. What's the matter? A problem? What's wrong? Unidentified armed rebels attacked... killing and wounding dozens of civilians. Coming from over the border where they have their base, the rebels attacked harmless civilians. The army has stopped their advance and inflicted a punishing defeat. Chad strongly condemns these cowardly incursions. Our country will not be destabilized by... OK, coming. You called for me? Adam, this is very hard for me, but I have to do my job. The pool is over. What do you mean? From now on, you are the hotel gatekeeper. What?! The pool is my life! Calm down! Keep your head! They're shutting down the pool? No. Abdel will be the pool attendant. Abdel? Champ, chin up! Dad. Well... Listen. Let me explain. There's nothing to explain. Here's the key to the moped. I'm sorry, Dad. I really need this job too. You know, I'm also... I've got obligations too. Dad! Morning. You're the one they call "Champ"? I'm Masra, the new cook. Gardole! Hey, beat it! Scram! Dirty animal! He did no harm. I hate dogs. I'm allergic to them. Damn hound! I can't understand your silence. I've prepared a nice meal and no one's saying a word. You always compliment my cooking. But tonight? Not a word. If there's something wrong, tell me. Is it the food? I don't like it. That's all I can say. Good evening. Who is it? Your neighbor. May I ask you something? Yes? Do you have any salt? Let me go and see. Do you think I'm old too? You've got some nerve! Every time you come, it's to ask for something. Show some restraint. I don't know what's going on! As soon as I go, you talk. When I come back, silence. No one's said a word about my cooking. You won't answer me either. You're determined not to talk? How old is your son now? He's 20. Mine's 17. Abdellah. For the war effort, I gave him to the army. He'll be made a captain on his return. A captain in the family, that counts! He'll be made captain. Or so they said. I haven't told anyone else, Adam. Keep it to yourself. I have to go. I'm late. Wait. Hold on. It's not me who decides, you know. It's not that I won't pay. It's just that I'm broke. You've got 3 days, Adam. That's all I can do. Come on. Good. Now back the other way. That's right. Great. It's the heart acting up, Champ. Just when you most need it, it goes and packs up. Fickle thing, a heart. How's the pool? Alright? Fine. Just fine. You hang in there, Champ. I had it coming from the start. But you... You put up a fight! Stand up for your rights. Don't let them fire you. I miss the hotel at times. I don't understand, Adam. I just don't get how you can fire a cook. I mean, a cook like me, when I cook for people, I cook from the heart, for people. It's an act of love. You're the best cook I know, David. Guess what Mrs. Wang said at my meeting. She said: Everyone complains you drink too much. So I said: People here talk too much because they've got nothing better to do. Then, she said: The clients complain about your cooking. They say it's too salty. So you know what I said? Only when I'm in love, Mrs. Wang! Good morning, Mom. Good morning, Abdel. Did you sleep well? Yes, thanks. Have some coffee. Smile! Hey, Dad! What's up? Come on. Come and eat. It'll do you good. Dad! You look like an old lion. You're all... I dunno. Give us a smile at least. Want some coffee? I'll bring you a coffee, OK? - What's up with him? - He's not feeling well. - Good morning. - Good morning. Is Abdel Ousmane here? Yes. What do you want? He's been drafted. Wait! Wait a minute! Adam, help! He's my only son! Adam, Adam! Where's Adam? For several weeks now, insecurity has reigned in the east. Rebel incursions are on the increase. Yesterday, fighting opposed rebel and government forces. 5 vehicles were destroyed and 37 rebels taken captive including a former Chadian army officer. The authorities call on all patriots to be vigilant, to stay alert and to denounce all enemies among us. Hello! Hello. Hello there. Is Abdel here? Abdel... I'm his girlfriend. His girlfriend? Yes. Welcome, my child. Sit down. Here you go. Eat. It'll cheer you up. Eat, Adam! What's the matter? Tell me! - David? - Yes? Do you believe God really exists? I do believe in God, but... I'm beginning to lose faith in him. Come on, eat. Eat up, please. Eat. Greetings Champ. How are you? You've got to eat something. From now on, I'm fasting until our son comes home. There's nothing we can do but pray to God. Heaven won't help us, Mariam. What's your name? Dj?n?ba Kon?. How old are you? Seventeen. Where are you from? From Mali. What do you do? I'm a singer. A singer? Yes. All my family are artists. I've been singing since I was six years old. How did you meet Abdel? I sing in a bar. One night, at the end of the concert, he came to see me. He invited me to dinner. We've been together a year now. I'm expecting his baby. Eat, my child. Where is Abdel? You can live with us from now on. You can have Abdel's room. Thank you, mother. Go on, eat up. Ahmat! I've changed my mind about the army. - Let go! I'm sick! - Do something, please! What shall I tell them? You want them to think we're both traitors? You know what they'll do to us? I'll go in his place. It's too late, Adam. I wanted to go too in my son's place. But they refused. Too old. Listen, Champ. You know, I'm tired too. Sick and tired of this filthy job they make me do. So tired. Sorry, I have to go to the toilet! Hello. Hello. - Hello, sir. - Hello, son. - Are you Abdel's father? - Yes. - Is he hurt? - This is for his girlfriend. - Is he alright? - Yes. - He's not hurt? - No. I have to go. Have some tea with us. I'm exhausted, thank you. Just a cup! My sweetheart, at last a minute to send you these words. It is hell on earth here. The heat, the dust, the terrible food. We're fighting the rebels. There have been deaths. Two of my friends have been killed. I'm scared. I'm not going to die, my love. All I can think of is deserting. I'll come get you and we'll leave the country for good. This is no future for our child. I think of you and the baby all the time. I wish I could hear your voice. Try to send me a tape if you can. I'm at the Abeche barracks for now. Not for long. We'll be sent to the front again soon. I miss you terribly. A kiss with all my love. Everything OK, Adam? I can rely on you, at least. Thank you, Adam. The rest of the staff haven't come in today. Not even Souad. She's gone. In the southeast, there has been heavy combat between government forces and RPJ rebels, the Popular Rally for Justice. The rebels claim to have taken two strategic towns, information immediately denied by the government. Given the repeated attacks, as of today, a curfew has been declared throughout the whole country, from 6 pm to 6 am. The government asks the population to remain calm. Halt! Where are you going? Dismount! Don't you know there's a curfew? Hey, hold on! It's Champ, the pool attendant. - The what? - The pool guy. Don't you know him? Go on, get home! Quick! Make it snappy! Cool it! Shoot! Shoot damn it! Wait! Hey wait! Hold it! Wait! Come here. Take it. Take your bike! Get going now. Fast! Father. I'm scared. Go to bed now. I'm here. Good evening! What is it now? What do you need this time? Nothing this time. The rebels are approaching. We're leaving for Cameroon. I came to say goodbye. - You're leaving? - We are. May God protect you. You heard the neighbor. They're leaving for Cameroon. Everyone's fleeing. It's chaos. Do something. We can't just stay here. What about my work at the pool? I'm talking about life and death and you're worried about the pool? Are you mad? You've changed, Adam. I don't recognize you anymore. It's not me. It's the world that's changed. Champ! Champ! Listen! Look here now! Champ! Hey! Back off! That's right. Easy now. Back off! Come on, kids. Let's go! Do not flee! The situation is under control. Keep calm! Go about your business! Go back home! Go about your affairs! The situation is back to normal. Dj?n?ba! Hello, father. What's the matter? Abdel. It was me who gave him to the army. Abdel, my son! Dad, I want to go home. That's why I came here. We missed you, son! Have a date. A little rest and then home. Dj?n?ba and your mother are there waiting. We'll all be together again. - It's all over. - Dad... I know everything. I want to swim. In the river. Abdel. Abdel.
