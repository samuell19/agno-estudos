While the world seeks to discover life on Mars, my family is stuck on this belly. This is my Mudra. See how hard she's praying. No one prays as hard as she does. I can guarantee that. She has only one wish in life: to give our family an heir. This is Bapu-ji. There's only one question on father's mind. What is it? The position of the child's feet make it hard to say. We'll check again in a few weeks. And Ba has only one answer. I'm sure it's a boy. This time Mata-ji's blessings are with us. Like every time we're here once again. But this time, Mata-ji's blessings are with us. Ma, bless us with the light of our family. Say something, Ma. If it shakes its head, it's a boy. And if not... chilled water. A boy. Ma has spoken! Ma has spoken! She has spoken. Come. Mata-ji always blesses you. Don't be offended, Pruthvishbhai, but it's serious this time. Her body has grown weak. How come? We feed her so well. Hear me out. She's had five miscarriages, right? Six. Six abortions. So, her body is weaker. I doubt she can get pregnant again. It's my duty to inform you. It's your decision now. - Let's go, Jashoda. - Come. Take the prescription. She must have these tablets twice a day, after meals. Hurry up! Easy, Mudra. Go very carefully. Be careful, or she might have problems later. Sleep on time, eat a healthy diet. We get it. Come now. Stop fasting every second day. - Praise to Mata-ji! - Jai Ma... I hear my heart go boom like a firecracker Shaking up the room like a firecracker Stars looking down are shining on her, that firecracker She's a firecracker If you learn so much English, you won't find a husband. This is my 9-year-old daughter, Siddhi. Siddhi is a lucky girl. When she was in Mudra's womb, father invited a Baba especially from Rajasthan. If a yellow laddoo falls, it's a boy. If a red laddoo falls then... Siddhi was our firstborn. A firstborn is forgiven in our family. After that, the family and the community want only a boy. - In other words... - Praise to Lord Krishna! And if she's carrying a girl? Praise to Mata-ji! What's wrong? Are you OK? You didn't sleep a wink, did you? Sleep does not bless me. Jayesh! Jayesh! Jayesh! My sister Preeti's husband is Mudra's brother. He gets drunk and beats my sister. Go! In our childhood, it was decided Mudra would marry into our family, and my sister Preeti into theirs. In our community we call this 'Saata Saadi.' So the way you treat our daughter, ditto, is how we'll treat yours. This 'Saata Saadi' is a kind of security deposit, from the smallest rift to divorce, same to same happens here and there. Preeti was beaten there. So I must be the man here. No Father! Look at me! I told you. Look at me. I'll teach you! - Bapu, stop hitting my mother! - Scream louder. Let her go! What does your brother think of himself? Siddhi, move aside! You're the worst! Stop sucking our blood, Mudra. He's overdoing it. My child! - Bapu, not the slipper. - Stand straight. Straight! That's enough. Don't overdo it, son. She's carrying our grandson. Take the video and stop. Move! Bapu, please let go of my mother. My child, enough! Jayesh! I said stop. Stop means stop! - Calm down. - Quiet! Calm down. Jayesh! What has he done? Jayesh, what happened? Come on out now. Why's he silent? Jayesh, what happened? My child! - I'm boiling with rage. - Son, why did you hit her so hard? Think about your unborn son Dhaval. - Hardik. - Dhaval. I only hit her face. The baby's OK. Jayesh, send them her photo. Calm down now. - Praise to Lord Krishna! - Bless you. Look at you! You overdid it today. And you were great. Especially that last 'aaah!' We've been married for nine years, even by mistake we haven't kissed once. Shocking, isn't it? Her only focus is to deliver an heir, while I wait patiently. When do I get my first kiss? Done. Yes. Sorry, little one. You endured another circus. Rest now. When you go to sleep, she'll sleep too. 'He'll.' Have faith. You'll see, we'll have a boy. Why? We could have a girl too. But you'll get rid of her. Why didn't you get rid of me? Sweetie, when we go to the temple, do we ask what offering we'll receive? Laddoo or shiro? We accept what we're given. You're right, Jayeshbhai. But try explaining that to your dear parents. They refused this offering. They've never hugged me. I'll tell them what you just said. Stop, you little shrew! Let go! I'm going to tell them. I'll tell them! - Rat! - Papa Rat. Hey! That's enough. - What a handful! - We're sleeping now. Easy. Don't be born a sleepless owl like your mother. OK Sarla. Yes? What's that illness called when you can't sleep? Insomnia. Ma has insomnia. Did you get the phone for me or her? For her. OK, children, go to sleep now. Let it go. These are our ancestors. They're like CCTV. They watch us all the time. Power runs in our family's veins. With this very spear, my great-grandfather conquered this village. So, it became known as 'Pravingadh'. Since then our lineage has had male heirs to preserve this power. This is the first time an outsider has dared to stand in the elections. Taking advantage of the 33% female quota, father has made Mudra stand in his place. She'll become the Village Chief, and I'll become Chief Husband. That way the power stays in father's pocket. First plea: Kamalkant and his daughter Anokhi. Sahib, when Anokhi was returning home from school yesterday, Ramanbhai's son stopped her on the way. He teased her, grabbed her veil, then started singing: 'Your fragrance 'Your breath...' Did he repeat the word 'bit' twice? 'Bit by bit makes my mind go blank.' Sahib, you know that liquor store in front of our school? The boys get drunk and loaf about, harassing us girls. Many girls have even stopped coming to school. Sahib, please ban alcohol. Soap! It's soap that must be banned. Did our female ancestors ever have fragrant soap? No, right? It is the law of nature. A female's fragrance is meant to attract a male. If our village girls use fragrant soaps, it's bound to excite our boys. Right? To protect their beauty is our solemn duty. From today our younger women are forbidden from using soap. Correct? Happy? Yes. See, child, 'your fragrance, your breath.' We can't do much about breath. So, we'll have to ban fragrance. He's right. It'll lead to progress. Go! Come. Sit down. Impressive! You've learned so quickly. Please stop! Or they'll all come to race you. One minute. Neutral. Impressive! - Listen. - Yes? - Go inside. I'll join you. - Where are you going? Just go. - You come too. - No. Don't share it with your secret society of women. 'You're a beautiful angel, life of the world. 'You're the prettiest, the most youthful.' That's what the soap ad says. They'll run out of water soon. Go! - Hello. Sarla. - Yes? In India what is the safest place for women? Look what I've found. Fellow citizens, I'm in a village in Haryana. The name of the village has a sad yet amazing story behind it. This is the Village Chief, Amar Tau-ji. Tau-ji, our honour is at stake. Your future bride is watching you on TV. Lift it higher for her sake, if not ours. Why has he taken on this Herculean challenge at his age? So that he can marry. Please. Like Amar Tau-ji, there are over 500 kind-hearted bachelors still waiting to marry. How come? Let's ask them. Brothers, how many of you are of marriageable age? And how many are married? Why not? What's the problem? We cannot find a bride. So how can we get married? Why can't you find a bride? I'm ashamed to say, but girls here were killed off in the womb. - Through gender determination tests. - Ultrasound tests. Please. Firstly, I'd like to apologise to every aggrieved woman in the country. I implore you to consider my request. Whatever caste you may be, whatever religion, whatever age, if you face trouble of any kind, come to our village. You will have your say here. No one will force you to do anything. You'll be happy and safe. If you come here, our village and our lives will flourish again. Years have passed since we've enjoyed the sweet nit-picking of mothers, sisters, and wives. What an amazing viewpoint, Tau-ji! This is the first time I've met... We shall welcome you with open hearts and extend our hospitality to you. We are so excited, that in anticipation of your arrival, our village will now be called 'Laadopur'. Long live Laadopur! Hear that, Bapu-ji? They've realized the importance of women and named their village, 'Laadopur', the village of daughters. Mata-ji, make him see some sense. Before your Village Chief leads you to new horizons, your former Village Chief has a memorable gift for you. On this auspicious occasion, and to welcome our unborn grandson, the village of Pravingadh is now renamed 'Dhavalgiri.' - Say after me, 'Dhavalgiri...' - Long live! - Goddess Ambe! - Praise to! - Say after me, 'Dhavalgiri...' - Long live! Long live Dhavalgiri! I am Govinda, you're Karishma I am Dharmendra, you're Hema Malini Let's disco Let's disco Let's disco, desi disco On the beat of the Kutchi drum Congratulations! We won. Your thumbprint. Careful. Father has got his way again. My Village Chief! You'll leave your mark on the world. You'll see. You'll see. - My child! - Yes, Ba? My sweet child. Bless you. Go! Dhavalgiri's Chief Husband! A famous doctor has come to Rannubhai's village. His TV can predict a child's gender. 100%. We must leave now. Hurry. If it's jinxed, we'll get rid of the child. Mudra can go back to her parents. Let's go. I don't want a battalion of women in my house. Meherbaan! Come! What's wrong? What you doing? Suitcase. What's wrong? Let's see the doctor. - The doctor has told me. - What? Praise to Mata-ji! - When? - That very day. - You should leave me. - We must run away. What? Only a few months more. Once she's born... I don't want to give birth to her. I couldn't fulfill my duty to give you an heir. Leave me. I'm worthless. If you don't want the baby, you kill it. Why ask the doctor? Just fall over. Mudra, we've murdered six babies in the womb. We should be punished. I can't let this happen yet again. I want this child. Don't you see? Your duty isn't about giving me an heir, but a kiss. Hurry, my child. We're getting late. Let's go. What is she doing? She's gone mad, Ba. She's capable of anything. What's going on? No, Bapu! No! - Meherbaan. - It's only a pair of scissors. Want to chance it? Why are you doing this? We want this child. This time you won't find a way out. She will. What did she say? We know it's a girl. Oh no! Mudra, you're making a terrible mistake. Mata-ji is watching you. She won't forgive you. Let go of my son. Repeat after me. Long live the Women's battalion! - Long live! - Fine. Listen. - Let go, grandpa. - Let him go, or... Let go, grandpa. Sorry, grandpa. Run! Meherbaan. Get me my phone! Hurry! Open the gate. Quick. Hello, hello. Dilbarbhai? Remember the plan to run away? The time has come. Yes. My wife and my two daughters will be with you very shortly. Just... Thank you, brother, thank you. - I'll get down on the way. - What? If we stay together, we'll get caught. They're right behind us. I'll stay here and act as a decoy. You... Damn! What is it, Jayeshbhai? I left the map at home. I have a map right here. Where to? Oh yes! Sher-e-Gujarat Dhaba. It's 40 kms from here... Found it. Impressive, sweetie! Head to Sher-e-Gujarat Dhaba. Ask for Dilbar Singh. He's my friend. I'll join you tonight and we'll continue together. No questions now, Mudra. - Where will we go? - Laadopur. Haryana. You drive. - But how? - Why not? You've taught me at night. It's daytime now. The car's the same. And it's harder driving at night. No one can see me at night. A woman driving in daylight? What'll people think? Just drive. Don't bother about what they think. - Hurry, children! - You're the captain now. Look after your mother and sister. Don't take any calls except for mine. Trust no one. Eat what we packed in the bag. Keep heading south. Praise to Mata-ji! Jayesh. Move aside. - My son, are you OK? - Yes, Bapu. - Are you OK? - I'm OK. I don't want... I don't want her. I don't want her. This cursed woman will never enter our house again, Bapu-ji. She's jinxed. She won't be allowed in. - There's no point going after her. - No! There is a point. If she is not taught a lesson, all our women will go astray. Mudra had many chances, but couldn't give us a single heir. Now this jinxed woman wants to give birth to a jinxed child. She's had it. She needs to be... - banished... - from our community. You're right. Let's do something, Bapu. No point going after her like headless chickens. Let's think calmly. We'll circulate her photo in the neighbouring villages. Inform the Commissioner. Let the others catch her. She'll be humiliated. Great fun. You're right. He's right. Call the Commissioner. Let's go home. We'll find her photo in our wedding album. You must have her photo on your phone. Sure. My phone keeps hanging. Cheap goods. Useless! Calm down. My in-laws gifted it to me at Diwali. Everything they've given us is useless. Never mind. The Commissioner, please. Pruthvishbhai is calling from Dhavalgiri. Dhavalgiri? Back to Pravingadh? Now it's a girl. Praise to Mata-ji! I've told you a hundred times to keep your mouth shut. The Commissioner. Hail to Lord Krishna! How are you? Sher-e-Gujarat Dhaba is 58 minutes away. This map is draining the battery. Now what? No stress, Mudra. I'll memorise the directions. I hear my heart go boom like a firecracker - Who was that? - Your father. Why did you hang up? Jayeshbhai told me not to take any calls. The battery's dead. What now? Not that one. Look under it. It's under that file. - That's the one. - Hurry. - Here. - Let's see. No. Look for a photo of the bride's arrival. Yes, uncle. This one? The bride must always be veiled. Damn it! Will you ever shut up? Must you vent your anger here? Damn the photo! Call her father, Jayesh. Look at this! Bapu, call the Commissioner back. That conniving woman. - It's a map! - Oh, yes! She's played a devious game. 'Sher-e-Gujarat Dhaba.' Let's go. Siddhi, what are you doing? Stop that, Siddhi. - Leave it alone. - Chill, Mudra! Let the fresh air in. Feel it and drive to glory! Damn it! Bapu. - Bapu. - Hold it in. I'm bursting! - What? Here? - Go. And hurry up! No, a proper toilet. Keep India clean! I'm Chief Husband after all. Bravo! Only in the urinal. Fill up the tank. You empty yours. Anyone else need to go? - Fun peeing together, no? - Sure. Ghanshyambhai, can I borrow your phone? Sure. Jayeshbhai, do I talk too much? Being clever is a curse. - Are you done? - Yes. The phone. Number two. Ghanshyambhai, see you outside. I said I'll see you outside. Bapu-ji! What are you doing? - Didn't you come to pee? - That came too. - Are you done? - Yes. Get moving! What a relief! Move it. Sister, namaste. Give me your bag. Come! Please come. Are you crazy? Shoo! That cat's a bad omen. Check the phone. Go. Never mind. I'll talk to you later. - You haven't had anything to eat. - It's OK. Tea? Coffee? Kalpeshbhai! Bimalbhai! Kausal. Mahadev. Rajan. Kisan. Park over there. Make it quick! Spread out. Keep your eyes open. Stop here, Bapu-ji. That's it. That's it. Find them. They must not escape. They must be hiding. Look everywhere. Search the toilets. Over there. Check the kitchen. Their car is still here. They must be around here somewhere. Bimal, search that locked room. Mehuliya, look near the car. A woman and her daughter were here. Have you seen them? Uncle! The car owners? Their car broke down. They abandoned it here and left. That way. They left ages ago. Let's go! Sir, have a seat. Tea? Coffee? Have something. Sir, sit down. Hey, bring some tea. Jayesh! Their phone is right here. They must be nearby. Quick! Yes, Bapu. Sir, sir! You rascal! You set up shop in our area and you dare lie to us? I'll fix you, bloody outsider. Where are they? Pruthvishbhai, they're here. Come quickly. Look! Over there. Catch them! Get them! Jayesh! Come on! Stop! Move! Make way. Step aside. Step back! A black cat - a bad omen. Oh God! We must break the jinx. 1, 2, 3. 4, 5. We've taken 3 steps. In our community, we take 10. 6, 7. Take no chances. Keep going. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Where are they? Stop! You can't go that way. Why not? Someone must cross the cat's path and take on the jinx. Damn it. Must you act the hero? I'm bound to be angry. I'm Chief Husband after all. Who'll go then? Come on, hurry. Go! Go! Are you going or not? The jinx is broken. Now run! Water. Stop! Stop. Siddhi! Stop! Nothing is beyond love. Nothing. Nothing is better than love. Nothing is above love. Drop us at Laadopur in Haryana. To Dharnipur, please. Those who come to us with hearts full of love. We shall hug them tight, that's our way. With swag, we welcome all. Hello? Bapu-ji? Where are you, child? I was desperately trying to call you. Bapu-ji, please don't tell anyone, but I'm on my way to you. Don't worry, child. Come home soon. I'll sort everything out. Stay calm, sweetie. Don't keep calling your father. Go. Jayesh. Right here. Come on, fix her. Brother? Uncle? Brother? Ma. At last! What did I do? Why didn't you make them drink it sooner? I could've hurt Mudra. I kept insisting. I had to force it down my mother-in-law's throat. - You're useless. - What's going on? Brother got me to spike the tea. - Amazing, Jayeshbhai. - Thanks, sweetie. - Did you kill them? - They're just unconscious. - They'll come round soon enough. - Quick, go! I'm so grateful to you. I should be grateful to you. If you run away, I can be rid of him. I can't live with your brother anymore. Sorry. Sorry. The drunkard checks my phone every night and notes down who I call and for how long. Look! He accuses me of cheating on him and hits me. Come morning he says sorry. Take this. And sorry! Sorry! Run! This is great fun. Go! Does saying 'sorry' make it right? - The car keys? - Brother, here! Enjoy! Go. Sorry. What'll happen to us now? A daughter. Another daughter. What happened? She kicked! Kick again for me, little one. Go on, kick, please. She must've fallen asleep. Yes, but your father must be awake by now. You're my hero. But now you must become an action hero. Jayeshbhai Jordaar! Play us a song. You know the one. 'Live life to the full.' You're always listening to that song. Don't you get bored of it? Listen to my song. Sweetie, you know the song in my heart. You must live life to the full My tomorrow may not come. But yours will. Let's just survive these 1200kms. Mata-ji, be our guiding light. I hear my heart go boom like a firecracker Life go boom like a firecracker Up to the moon like a firecracker She's a firecracker, she's a firecracker O little one, my eyes long to catch a glimpse of you My hands long to rock your cradle O little one, you will never come to any harm. I will protect you with my life Butterflies of nervousness flutter in my heart Though you're not yet born you're life itself to me Everything I do from now is for you alone All paths now lead to you How will I live up to this responsibility? It eludes me now but in time I shall learn How will I live up to this responsibility? It eludes me now but in time I shall learn O little one, my eyes long to catch a glimpse of you My hands long to rock your cradle you will never come to any harm. I will protect you with my life Bapu! Bapu! - Bapu! - Yes? Is this the man in the video? Yes, that's him. - Can we talk to him? - I'll send him a message. Yes, yes. Well done, sweetie. O mother! Your cheeks are bright red. Let me see. Poor you! Jayesh. Jayesh! Bapu-ji, I went inside for only two minutes. Then I saw you lying unconscious. Mudra had tied brother Jayesh's wrists with rope, covered his head with a pillowcase and dragged him away. When I ran after them, she told me not to, or else brother Jayesh will be... Take her photo. Send it to all the village chiefs and local authorities. Send it to everyone. Announce a huge reward. Send it to the Commissioner too. Get up everyone. Drinking water here is now a sin. I'm taking my daughter. Go, get your things. Take her home safely. Yes, Sahib. I used to think your daughter would live a life of shame. Now I think she won't live at all. Is it OK to say I'm having a little fun? You just said it. I was also having fun a few minutes ago. Did I say a word? - You said not to bottle things up. - Think of your timing. Don't jinx us by saying it out loud. A message from Aunt Preeti. Brother, a disaster! Bapu has circulated Mudra's photo and your car number. He's informed the police and offered a 500,000-rupee reward. Lie low for a few days. Be careful, brother. Jayeshbhai. Still having fun? Where are you travelling from? - Search all the cars. - Yes, sir. Where from? What is it? What the hell are you doing? A daughter is no less than a son. Get rid of your delusions. If we have daughters, we have a future. She's the light of the world. We must protect her. Save her, educate her. Don't say 'Son, a selfie'. Say 'Daughter, let's take a selfie'. Without a daughter or mother, life will cease to exist. A son studies, he progresses alone. A daughter studies, the whole family progresses. A daughter is the country's glory, giving us our true identity. Let's take a selfie. We'll split the cash prize. Get lost! Is that the way to treat guests? Don't worry, he's harmless. There's a government campaign. 'Take a selfie with a daughter, get a cash prize'. Forgive me. Go away! Cash! I've taken the selfie. He's a troubled man. His mother brought him up all on her own. Her dying wish was for him to have a daughter. But when his wife gave birth to five sons, he left her. When she remarried, her firstborn was a girl. Then he knew the fault was in him. Or he would still be trying for a girl. Never mind. Where are you from? We're going to Amba-ji on a pilgrimage. Oh! Congratulations! Is there somewhere we could stay for the night? You're at Bhikha Homestay. Come, come with me. Please sit. Water! My wife. She's from Bengal. I just got married, two weeks ago. Really? She cost me 200,000-rupees. My pockets are empty now. And me? Yes, you swine. We have a language problem. We talk through film dialogue. Is that so? In English, they say 'I love you'. In Gujarati, they say... 'Prem karu chu.' In Bengali, they say... 'Ami tomake bhalobhashi.' Hear that? Such a jackass! Half the reward money is mine. It must've been hard for his Bengali wife to settle here. She's settled well. Yummy food. So much food for just us three. Four. Mudra is on top form today! My tummy is about to burst. Bhikhabhai! Your family is on its way. The extra food will come in handy. Hey, hey! What are you doing? Bhikhabhai. Help! Is anyone there? Anyone there? Help! Help us! They'll separate us now, won't they? Give him his kiss. Who knows when... Little shrew! 'I am the power!' Close your eyes. You, too. Turn around. Impressive! Why don't you come with us to Laadopur? Yes, sister. Come. I've got him under my control. I love you all! Likewise. - Let's go. - Take care. Get the car door! Bapu, the tyres are flat. Sweetie, hide! Stay right here. Sahib! Bapu-ji! I'll explain everything. Please stay calm. - You rascal! You cheated me. - Bapu-ji, hear me out. And you're my blood? How dare you! My name is Siddhi. This is my mother. Mudra. And my father. Jayeshbhai. Save my sister Disha. She's in my mother's womb. You conned me. Is this how I raised you? Scoundrel. You damn trickster! We're stuck in Ujaas village. Help us. If you can't come, make this post go viral. Please. Just look what they're doing to us. - What made you do it? - Bapu-ji... - Bapu-ji, no. - Let go! Sahib, my reward! Give me my reward. Control him! Shut him up. You OK? Careful. Stand still. Leave us alone, Bapu-ji. Snap out of her spell. Cut him up if you want to, but give me my reward first. Shut up! What have you turned my son into? Stop! Just stop! Or I'll castrate myself. Come to your senses! - I'll do it. - No! The end of your lineage. I'll be no use to the community. Let's get him. No, son. Stop! No one move. I want this baby. She will be born. If you dare touch her, I won't spare myself. My boy! He is possessed by her. My boy. Don't do that. Don't do that. The keys. The keys. But, Pruthvi... The car keys! Here, son. Back off! Go. Come. Move! Come, Siddhi. What just happened? What did I do? Did you see Bapu-ji's face? He'll go to any lengths now. No more stopping on the way. Straight to Laadopur. Mudra's father. The traitor. No, sweetie. Don't say that. What's wrong? Are you OK? Castrating yourself! Such thoughts don't befit you. You're a man. What? You must continue your lineage. Mudra, why did we run away? What was the point? Is this baby not our lineage? Is Siddhi not our lineage? If they are not our heirs, then I cannot give you or the community the heir you want. Didn't you hear that madman's story? A child's gender depends on the man. So what if I'm castrated? Could I give you a son? No, right? So, by your definition I'm not a 'man'. Mudra, you leave me. - What are you saying? - You kept saying: 'I couldn't give you an heir, so leave me.' I can't give you an heir, so you leave me. - No. - Why not? Did you abandon me? Are you done? You give? She gives? God gives us children. You said that. And Mudra, you told me children come from a hospital. When you two don't know, why did you lie to me? I love Sarla! Bapu! Blood. What? Blood. - Where to? - Our hospital. Back into the danger zone? We can't risk going to any hospital. Hold your mother tight, sweetie. - Was that Jayesh? - Yes. Turn round! Clear the way! Where's he gone? Damn traffic! - Terrible road! - This is a shortcut. Go straight for two kilometres. Sarla, please be considerate. Our baby is inside her. Sorry, I don't understand what you're saying. Siddhi-ji, I'm Amar. The Village Chief of Laadopur. I saw your video. I can see you're all in danger. Where are you? Ujaas? Are you still there? Tell me. Please. Don't worry. We'll come and rescue you wherever you are. - Anyone called Jayesh or Mudra here? - Ask on the first floor. She's had a miscarriage. I could save only one of them. Get out of here! Bapu! Jayesh. My son! Don't come near Mudra. You've turned her into a baby-making machine. Jayesh! Who do you think you are? At least my daughter tried, but your daughter, Preeti? She's barren. Pruthvi, let go! Rascal! What's this nonsense? This is a hospital. Get out! Let him go. Out! Get up, Bapu. The 'Saata' is defunct now. Take him away. Jayesh, come on. Get up. Move aside. Bapu! Bapu! Come on. Move away! Start the car. Bapu! Bapu! We'll fix them later. Bapu! You still have a daughter to fight for. Bapu! Bapu! Bapu! You still have a daughter to fight for. My son, you haven't eaten all day. This won't do. Come. Eat something. Be grateful to your parents that you were born at all. If you hadn't lived, nor would I. And if you weren't born, I would have been thrown out. Accept your responsibilities. You must continue your lineage. Uphold the honour of your ancestors. Think of the community. We have to face them every day. I have to face myself too, Ba. Eat up. Your mother gave this to me. She said you were selected for a theatre competition. But you were married off before it had taken place. Then... the veil came in the way. How long must we be martyrs, Ba? Years of sacrifice have hardened you. But I know it is not your fault. You were never loved. Your father and I have decided. You'll ride the wedding horse again. Swear on my life. Ba. I pushed you too hard. Sorry. Bapu-ji, you made them tremble. Sad you didn't pass on your acting talent. Calling Preeti barren was too much! That line did the trick. I had goosebumps. - That good, eh? - Absolutely! Mudra. All well? Not long now. Watch my family gasp when 50 wrestlers take us away in two days. Did you talk to Amar Tau? They're on their way. They'll be here before your wedding. Wedding? Her parents are just coming to see me. I'll play the groom for two days. Do it well. Meaning don't do it well. Mata-ji has blessed our family. All our daughters' firstborns are sons. Yes! Or else you may send her back. No problem. What if the problem lies with me? May I say something? Yes, Preeti. Don't marry him. My brother is very hot-headed. He'll beat you badly. You'll regret marrying him forever. Why regret? It'll be his right. I might have done something to deserve it. She's well trained. I'm a virgin. Your son is lost in my daughter's eyes. Done? - Mayurbhai... - Congratulations. Congratulations to you! Time to celebrate. How's your new bride? She's a pure virgin. What's this 'virgin' business? Ask Sarla. We would only lie to you, wouldn't we? Just one more night. - Don't stress. - Don't you either. - I'm not stressed. - You look it. Since the day you talked about running away, something's been bothering me. We'll get away but what about them? Them? You know we women meet in secret at night? You must think we watch movies together, listen to songs and unburden ourselves. Come. We do unburden ourselves, but not in the way you think. Come. The saddest woman sits in the centre of the circle. No questions, no advice. Solace is found in each other's company. Yesterday when we were laughing together in the car, I thought of them then. They were always there for me. How can we abandon them and settle in Laadopur? We greatly admire what you have done. If you don't mind, may I say something? We all endure so much in silence. We cry, we suffer. But this made the elders dominate us more. Society only keeps count of our good and bad deeds. No one keeps count of love. Why doesn't anyone think of a kiss? You might think a kiss is nothing. But what is a kiss? A kiss is a way of expressing one's love. Our childhoods were so full of joy. Everyone kissed us. And we kissed them back. We felt loved. What changed us? Society conditioned us to make money, make a name for ourselves, to look after a home and children. That's all very well, If we weren't so conditioned, what would we still have? A kiss. I was raised to believe: 'You're a man 'Men don't fear. Grab whatever you want.' But this doesn't work when it comes to a kiss. How can I just grab a kiss? She must want to kiss me too. If I stay here, society will always come in the way of my kiss. I've had enough. I'm leaving. But just consider this. Today they've locked away the soap, tomorrow it could be you who is locked away. They'll only let you out when they want an heir. Till then remain locked in. Safely. Sorry if I offended. Stop crying. Look at me. Stop that crying. Tomorrow you're getting married. I don't want to see any of these faces at the wedding. That goes for you too. Let's go, Jashoda. What? Nine in the morning. Siddhi! The Laadopur men are on their way. I'll call and let them know. We'll be there on time. No need to stress. I'm calling them. What is it? Nothing. You should rest. All is well. Don't worry. They're coming. There's no need to worry. I'm in touch with Siddhi. What are you doing here? Just chatting, Bapu-ji. Asking if he's OK. - Where are you taking me? - Get in there! Bapu-ji, why are you locking the door? Bapu-ji! Open the door. Will somebody open the door? Bapu-ji! Get the priest, quick. The warrior girl, Charankanya! Our brothers from Laadopur! Greetings to all you ladies! Greetings to all the ladies! Our brothers from Laadopur... Greetings to all the ladies! Where's your focus? You breaking a wedding? Or getting wed? What am I doing, Tau? We're here to break the wedding. Sorry. We're sorry, Siddhi-ji. Fine! Now all eyes on me. Hello! On this auspicious occasion, when Lord Indra descends on His horse, the sound of our fervour will lure Him to stop at Pravingadh's gates. He will ask: 'For whom does the wedding band play?' He shall bear witness to our Jayeshbhai riding to his wedding. Courtesy of our Sargam band! Hit it! Hit it! Louder! Adorn the palanquin Behind the groom's garland. Hide your face Keep your feelings hidden in your heart Hello. We're not coming. Why not? The hospital called. My baby sister is on her way. Ma's health is very weak. I must go to her. Tell Bapu. Hurry. But how do I... - Drive fast. - Hurry, brother. Hello, hello. Best wishes to Pruthvishbhai! A big day for Jayeshbhai! Paint your hands with henna. Adorn the palanquin Paint your hands with henna. Adorn the palanquin Impressive! Dance your hearts away! Louder! Let me feel the beat. Listen! Just sing it! Praise to Mata-ji! Come, you've been summoned by the call of Mother Come, you've been summoned by the call of Mother May Mata-ji bless Jayeshbhai's new beginning in life. That is our heartfelt wish. She has gone into labour. Ba! Ba! I kept my word. I rode the wedding horse for your sake. Now I'll do what I must. I take it you'll bless me. The breeze sings praise of Thee Praise to Mata-ji Say it with love. Praise to Mata-ji! Everybody! Praise to Mata-ji! Praise to Mata-ji! When the song plays and the beat resounds How adorable he looks! No, Bapu-ji. Let go! Doesn't play tough, Dons a childlike innocence Jayesh! No! He's never beaten up. Nor does he flex his muscles And yet everyone proclaims Again, again and again Our brother packs a punch! He's impressive! Our brother packs a punch! Our brother packs a punch! Get the car out! Our brother packs a punch! He's Jordaar! - Jayeshbhai. - Amar Tau. Please. Sweetie, all OK? They won't let me inside. I've seen a childbirth on YouTube. - Sweetie, handle things outside. - We'll guard the entrance. Go to her. Mudra! Doctor! Her pressure is dropping. No pressure, Mudra. No pressure at all. Push, Mudra. Push harder. Push. You're Jordaar! Push! Yes. You must push harder, Mudra. What's happening here? She's happening here. Praise to Mata-ji! Advance! Have you seen their muscles? They've come from Laadopur, Haryana. If anyone tries acting smart, they'll be beaten black and blue. Siddhi-ji, sorry. We will not hit anyone. We have sworn not to. - What? - Yes. This is childish, uncle. Your muscles are why I called you here. One minute. Brother, we will not resort to violence. Forget about Jayeshbhai remarrying, let them come with us. Please. Crush them! Siddhi-ji, sorry. The Laadopur men must be beating up my family right now. Push Disha out. Then we'll live happily in Laadopur. Take a deep breath. - A deep breath. - Breath, Mudra. - Mudra, don't sleep. - No sleeping, Mudra. Open your eyes, Mudra. Don't sleep. Mudra. Down there. Brothers, down there. Hold it. All together! We'll advance together. All together! Charge! Open your eyes. Don't let her sleep. Keep her awake. She must stay awake. Mudra! Mudra, soap. Smell the soap. Smell it. - Doctor! - Excellent! Keep pushing. That's great, Mudra. - Push harder, Mudra. - Harder. Harder! Hold on tight! Please! Push! Stop! Move! Just stop! Or else... Or else, what? All of us women will go and live in Laadopur. Jashoda. Take them all home. - Jashoda! - Please. Say 'please!' Please. Jashoda! Say it with love. What are you waiting for? Sort out your women and send them home. Let's go! Say after me: 'Women's battalion... 'Long live!' We've taken an oath not to hit anyone or let anyone else hit. Sorry. She's bleeding badly. - Stay calm. - I'm going to die. You'll be fine. I'm dying. Mudra, you'll be OK. I haven't had my kiss yet. Well done, Mudra! Wow! Congratulations, Jayeshbhai. Congratulations on your baby girl! Jayeshbhai, this was our last duty. This is it. All the village women are coming to Laadopur with you. We want to express love through a kiss. Yes! But what will become of them? What? You said staying here... I was wrong. Running away is not the answer. And... My first kiss has changed my mind. If we all leave then Pravingadh will become another Laadopur. No, Jayeshbhai. We would not wish that on our worst enemy. You are lucky. You don't see what you have. Please understand. Our menfolk are what they are. It is not their fault. They've imbibed whatever they've seen, heard or learned. But people can change. Take our Mudra. See how she's changed. My mother has changed. Father has changed. No, not you. I mean Mudra's father has changed. You're right, Jayeshbhai. But if we do kiss them, will they kiss us back? Sister, there's a kiss hidden in everyone. Take it from me, it's only a matter of time. If anyone plays the tough guy, or gets violent, call me... No, no. I think a little peck will make things right. One of us is coming to Laadopur for sure. A real-life action hero. His daughter's video 'Jayeshbhai Jordaar' has gone viral. Meet the father who held a knife to himself so his daughter would be born. Men like him are changing the perception of masculinity. Son! Look after your baby. Bapu, why don't you? How can I? Just for two minutes. Ssh! Quiet. Be quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Be quiet, please! Look after her. My bread is burning. A dew drop has awoken from slumber It stretches itself with joy My dreams are alive now Who knows how the seasons changed Who knows how happiness smuggled itself in In the depth of my heart In the depth of my heart A fresh breeze is blowing In the depth of my heart In the depth of my heart A fresh breeze is blowing Flow on, O blissful life I won't say keep kissing. A few pecks a day will go a long way. Those who were afraid of dreaming Now fly around with ease A thousand chains were unchained Who knows how happiness smuggled in In the depth of my heart In the depth of my heart A fresh breeze is blowing Flow on, O blissful life Praise to Mata-ji! When my Disha was born, I had a burning desire to dance. But I didn't. Then I thought to myself, why hold back? So to celebrate my Disha's arrival, and with my Mudra's blessings, I'll dance to my Siddhi's favourite song. A Jordaar Presentation. I hear my heart go boom like a firecracker Her eyes are like a detonator They all say she's a firecracker You're a firecracker, she's a firecracker Your attitude's so cute A sure heartbreaker Desi rappers rap about you She's a firecracker, she's a firecracker I follow you like a GPS tracker Pleasing her takes forever She never forgives She sure scares me She's full on, so carefree She follows her heart Floating in the sky Your bright red scarf Your bright red scarf Your bright red scarf Blowing in the wind Your bright red scarf Your bright red scarf Your bright red scarf Never says sorry Has 940 whims I swear Her tantrums are matchless Many traits Has my baby Who taught her? Even God does not know Floating in the sky Your bright red scarf Your bright red scarf Your bright red scarf Blowing in the wind Your bright red scarf Your bright red scarf Your bright red scarf You're a firecracker She's a firecracker You're a firecracker, she's a firecracker You're a firecracker She's a firecracker You're a firecracker, she's a firecracker
