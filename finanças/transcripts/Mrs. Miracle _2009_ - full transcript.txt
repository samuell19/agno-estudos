THIS MOVIE THEATER, THIS OLD MOVIE THEATER WITH AMAZING DETAILS. RUN DOWN, BUT... THEY WANTED TO JUST LEVEL IT, START FROM SCRATCH. WE WERE ABLE TO SHOW THEM HOW THEY COULD ACTUALLY MAKE MORE MONEY BY RENOVATING IT INTO A RESTAURANT AND ART GALLERY. OKAY, WAIT, NOT-NOT THE OLD RIALTO ON 30TH? YEAH, YOU KNOW IT? REALLY? I WENT THERE ALL THE TIME WITH MY FAMILY. I DID TOO. REALLY? YEAH.

WHEN YOU ASKED EARLIER WHY I'D STOPPED PLAYING THE PIANO, I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING, AND-AND... THE REASON I DIDN'T, HONESTLY, IS BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN A FANTASTIC EVENING. I DIDN'T WANT TO RUIN IT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I STOPPED PLAYING PIANO THE DAY MY WIFE DIED. PAMELA LOVED MUSIC, AND, UM... SOMETIMES SHE WOULD JUST LIE THERE AND LISTEN TO ME PLAY. AFTER SHE WAS GONE, I JUST DIDN'T SEE THE POINT. YEAH, THAT WAS A PART OF YOUR MEMORY OF HER. IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU SHARED TOGETHER. AND EVERYTHING THAT I LOVED ABOUT IT THEN JUST MAKES IT ALL THE MORE PAINFUL NOW. EVERYBODY TELLS ME I SHOULD PLAY AGAIN, BUT... BUT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND. AND SOME THINGS YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN, SO I JUST STOPPED TRYING. UNTIL TONIGHT. I'M GLAD YOU TOLD ME. MAYBE WE CAN, UH, DO THIS AGAIN SOMETIME. MAYBE. I'LL CALL YOU? YOU BETTER. GOOD NIGHT.

IT'S JUST BEEN A LITTLE CRAZY AROUND HERE. I ONLY WISH I HAD BETTER NEWS. I'M SORRY? THE TRUTH IS, I'VE RUN OUT OF IDEAS. A FULL-TIME HOUSEKEEPER WILLING TO LIVE IN AND CARE FOR TWO SMALL CHILDREN? I'M AFRAID I CAN'T HELP YOU. WELL, WHAT ABOUT MRS. MERKLE? WHO? EMILY MERKLE, DIDN'T YOU SEND HER? MR. WEBSTER, WE DON'T HAVE ANYONE BY THAT NAME WORKING FOR US. I'M SURE WE TALKED ABOUT THIS. WELL, I THINK I WOULD'VE REMEMBERED. WELL, THE ACKERMAN EMPLOYMENT AGENCY RAN OUT OF CANDIDATES, AND THEY CALLED AROUND AND CALLED SOMEONE AT THE COMPANY THAT I WORK FOR. THE PARADISE VALLEY EMPLOYMENT SERVICES? YES. I MEAN, THEY'RE THE ONES WHO SENT ME HERE, AND THEY HAVE MY RECORDS AND ALL THE PAPERWORK, AND I AM SO SORRY ABOUT THIS MISUNDERSTANDING. WELL, I'VE NEVER READ BETTER REFERENCES. BUT I DO INTEND ON CALLING EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE PEOPLE MYSELF. OF COURSE! OKAY. THE COOKIES ARE READY! OKAY, WELL, THERE'S... OH, DON'T YOU JUST LOVE HOW COOKIES MAKE EVERYTHING SMELL LIKE CHRISTMAS? SO, THE AGENCY, THEY DIDN'T SEND HER? A DIFFERENT AGENCY. SHE SAYS SHE TOLD ME. I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE SHE DID. I DON'T REMEMBER. WELL, DO YOU FEEL ALL RIGHT ABOUT IT NOW? I MEAN, SHE EXPLAINED EVERYTHING? YEAH, I WAS NEVER WORRIED ABOUT HER. I MEAN, THERE'S... I DON'T KNOW, THERE'S JUST KIND OF SOMETHING ABOUT HER. THE KIDS CALL HER MRS. MIRACLE. "MIRACLE"? I KNOW. BUT I GOT TO SAY, WHEN... WHEN YOU'RE AROUND HER, YOU JUST... YOU JUST KIND OF FEEL LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. WHAT'S GOING TO BE OKAY? EVERYTHING. WELL, I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET HER. YOU SHOULD HAVE DINNER WITH US... SUNDAY NIGHT. SHE'S A GREAT COOK. UM... YEAH. ALL RIGHT. GREAT. GREAT. I MEAN, HE'S ALREADY INVITING YOU OVER TO MEET THE FAMILY. THAT'S NOT BAD. NO, IT'S... IT'S NOT LIKE THAT, OKAY? HE HAS A NEW HOUSEKEEPER, AND HE JUST WANTS MY OPINION. MRS. MIRACLE? YEAH. OH, I AM A BIG FAN. EVER SINCE SHE RODE INTO DODGE, THOSE BOYS, THEY'VE BEEN GREAT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE THE TWINS WERE EVER BAD KIDS, BUT I DON'T KNOW, IT'S LIKE THEY ALWAYS KNEW SOMETHING WAS MISSING FROM THEIR LIVES, YOU KNOW? AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE THEY LOST THEIR MOTHER, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S IT. WELL, THEN, WHAT IS IT? I DON'T KNOW, BUT I GET THE FEELING SHE DOES, MRS. MIRACLE. HI. HOW ARE YOU? I'M GOOD. HOW ARE YOU? THIS IS FOR YOU. THANK YOU. OH, HI. REBA, THIS IS MRS. MERKLE. EMILY MERKLE, REBA MAXWELL. HI! ACTUALLY, I THINK THAT WE'VE MET BEFORE, UM, SORT OF. YOU DROPPED YOUR BELL AT THE AUDITORIUM, AND... WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW? IT'S A SMALL WORLD, HUH? WELL, HOW NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO. OH, I HEAR YOUR CHRISTMAS PAGEANT'S GOING TO BE A REAL SMASH! WELL, WE'RE... WE'RE GETTING THERE. OH, YEAH, YOU'RE GETTING THERE. UH, THERE'S BEEN A SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLAN. I DIDN'T KNOW THIS, BUT MRS. MERKLE PROMISED SHE WOULD TAKE THE BOYS TO A MOVIE TONIGHT. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU MADE PLANS, SO... BUT I'VE GOT SOME SOUP ON THE STOVE AND A LOVELY BAGUETTE IN THE OVEN. THAT SOUNDS FINE. OH, HOLY COW, I'M GOING TO MISS THE PREVIEWS. LISTEN, I'VE GOT TO RUN, BUT I'M SURE YOU CAN MANAGE. WE'LL BE FINE. BOYS, COME ON, WE'RE GOING TO MISS THE PREVIEWS! YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW HAVE I BEEN TO ALL THOSE STORES ALL THOSE TIMES AND NEVER SEEN YOU? I WAS WONDERING THE SAME THING ABOUT YOU. WELL, GUESS IT'S TRUE WHAT THEY SAY. IT'S ALL IN THE TIMING. I GUESS. CHEERS. CHEERS. SO TELL ME, HOW DOES SOMEBODY GO FROM WORKING IN THE THEATER TO OWNING A TRAVEL AGENCY? IT'S... A LONG STORY. I'VE GOT TIME. I, UH, I STARTED THE BUSINESS AFTER I WAS ENGAGED. YOU WERE MARRIED? NO. I'M SORRY. I, UH... I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING. I'M... IT'S LIKE I'M 15 AGAIN. I CAN'T GET MY BRAIN AND MY MOUTH IN THE SAME GEAR. WHAT? I HAVEN'T BEEN ON A DATE IN YEARS. I-I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO, HOW I'M SUPPOSED TO ACT. I MEAN, I'M JUST IN WAY OVER MY HEAD HERE. ME TOO. REALLY? YEAH, REALLY. I GUESS THAT'S... THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE BOTH HAVE IN COMMON. HI! KATE, GO AWAY. COOKIES... OH, WOW! ALL RIGHT, WOW... THOSE LOOK GREAT, YOU GUYS! THESE LOOK FANTASTIC. WOULD YOU LIKE MISS MAXWELL TO TRY ONE? - YEAH. - YEAH. WHICH ONE SHOULD I HAVE? UM... THAT ONE. THAT ONE RIGHT THERE? ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO... SO ARE THE BOYS HAPPY WITH THEIR ANGEL COSTUMES? THEY, UH... I THINK THEY WERE HAPPY WITH THEIR SWORDS, YEAH. YEAH. AND THE KIDS, THEY'RE JUST... THEY'RE WORKING SO HARD, AND THE SHOW, I MEAN, IT'S JUST, IT'S REALLY COMING TOGETHER. AND YOU'RE ENJOYING YOURSELF. YOU KNOW, I AM. IMAGINE THAT. THAT'S GREAT. WELL, AUNT MOLLY AND UNCLE BILL ARE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING YOU. MM, I CAN'T WAIT. HONEY, I WAS WONDERING... WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO HAVE CHRISTMAS DINNER WITH THEM ON CHRISTMAS EVE? BUT I CAN'T, BECAUSE I HAVE THE SHOW, REMEMBER? YEAH, I KNOW. I JUST THOUGHT IF IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO MAKE ANY OTHER ARRANGEMENTS, YOU KNOW? THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THAT WAS GREAT. THIS IS ABOUT VICKI, ISN'T IT? DOUG AND VICKI CAN'T COME ON CHRISTMAS EVE EITHER. DOUG'S FAMILY IS PLANNING ON VISITING HIS GRANDMOTHER. SHE'S ALMOST 90. HER HEALTH IS NOT GOOD, AND SO THEY... SO, OF COURSE, VICKI DECIDES TO SPEND CHRISTMAS DAY WITH YOU, THE ONLY CHANCE THAT I HAVE TO SPEND WITH AUNT MOLLY AND UNCLE BILL, RIGHT? YES, BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CHOICE. SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CHOICE? BUT I HAVE TO MAKE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS. YOU COULD STILL COME ON CHRISTMAS DAY. I MEAN, JUST SET ASIDE THIS SILLINESS WITH YOUR SISTER. YOU CALL WHAT VICKI DID TO ME SILLINESS? NO. NO, YOU KNOW WHAT I CALL SILLINESS? YOUR BEHAVIOR EVER SINCE. HOW MANY TIMES DOES SHE HAVE TO APOLOGIZE? WHY DO YOU ALWAYS DEFEND HER? MOM, I WAS THE ONE THAT WAS HURT. REBA, I THINK YOU'VE BOTH BEEN HURT ENOUGH. PLEASE, HONEY... YOU KNOW WHAT, MOM? DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. REBA... I LOVE YOU, MOM, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD SEE EACH OTHER FOR A WHILE, OKAY? SO MERRY CHRISTMAS. REBA... REBA, HEY. UM... CAN I TALK TO YOU? ABSOLUTELY. COME ON IN. THANKS. FOUR YEARS AGO, I WAS ENGAGED TO A TEACHER. HIS NAME WAS JOE GODDARD, AND, UM... I ASKED MY OLDER SISTER, VICKI, TO BE MY MAID OF HONOR, AND I JUST THOUGHT EVERYTHING, IT WAS GOING TO BE PERFECT, BUT VICKI AND I, WE'D ALWAYS BEEN VERY COMPETITIVE... SPORTS, GRADES, YOU NAME IT, AND BECAUSE SHE WAS OLDER, I... I THINK SHE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO OUTDO ME, BUT I WAS THE ONE THAT WAS GETTING ENGAGED FIRST, I WAS GETTING MARRIED FIRST, AND, UM... I HAD NO IDEA HOW MUCH THAT BOTHERED HER. WHAT HAPPENED? UM... THE DAY BEFORE THE WEDDING, JOE CALLED IT OFF. HE SAID THAT HE CHANGED HIS MIND, BUT HE DIDN'T TELL ME WHY, AND IT JUST DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. YOU KNOW, I TH... I THOUGHT THAT WE WERE SO HAPPY, AND THEN I FOUND OUT THE TRUTH. THE DAY WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GET MARRIED, JOE AND VICKI, THEY RAN AWAY TOGETHER... AND THEY SAID THAT THEY'D FALLEN IN LOVE. I'M SORRY. IT JUST... YOU KNOW, IT FELT LIKE SHE PLANNED IT. LIKE IT WAS... IT WAS JUST ANOTHER WAY FOR HER TO WIN, AND... I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO HER SINCE. AND THE IRONY IS IS THAT THEY WERE ONLY TOGETHER FOR A FEW MONTHS, AND THEN HE LEFT HER, LIKE HE LEFT ME, AND... AND NOW, I MEAN, SHE'S- SHE'S MARRIED TO SOMEBODY ELSE, AND THEY HAVE A LITTLE GIRL. AND YOU'RE LEFT TO JUST... PICK UP THE PIECES. I MEAN, SHE KEEPS TRYING TO APOLOGIZE, AND MY FAMILY, THEY WANT ME TO FORGIVE HER, AND TO MOVE ON... BUT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND. DO YOU? YOU WERE HURT, BUT MORE THAN THAT, YOU WERE BETRAYED BY THE TWO PEOPLE YOU TRUSTED MOST... AND YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT. WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE ANGER? COOKIE BREAK. OKAY? THEY'VE BEEN IN THERE A LONG TIME. WHAT ARE THEY DOING, MRS. MIRACLE? WELL, SOMETIMES GROWN-UPS NEED TO BE ALONE TO TALK THINGS OVER. WHAT KIND OF THINGS? WELL, SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. I'M NOT SURE THEY'RE EVER GOING TO FIGURE IT OUT, BUT I HAVE MY OWN THEORY. I THINK THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT FOR CHRISTMAS. OH... HAVE A COOKIE, SWEETIE. SO... YOU CAN'T SPEND CHRISTMAS EVE WITH YOUR FAMILY, NOT WITH THE PAGEANT. IT'S JUST, THERE'S JUST NO TIME. AND YOU DON'T WANT TO VISIT CHRISTMAS MORNING WITH YOU SISTER THERE. NO. WELL... LOOKS LIKE YOU ONLY HAVE ONE OTHER OPTION. WHAT? SPEND CHRISTMAS WITH US. NO. NO, I COULDN'T. WHY NOT? BECAUSE, YOU... YOU SHOULD SPEND CHRISTMAS WITH THE BOYS. I DON'T-I DON'T WANT TO INTRUDE. HEY, GUYS. OH... - HI. - HI. GUYS, I GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU. YEAH? DO YOU WANT MISS MAXWELL TO SPEND CHRISTMAS WITH US? YEAH. YEAH? - YEAH! - YEAH! YOU SURE? YEAH! WHAT DO YOU SAY? OKAY. - YAY! - YEAH! COOL! SO, DO YOU ALWAYS LEAVE YOUR SHOPPING TILL THE LAST MINUTE? YOU KNOW, EVERY YEAR I PROMISE MYSELF I'M NOT GOING TO DO THIS, BUT THEN IT JUST... THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH ME. ARE YOU KIDDING, AND MISS ALL THIS? SO LISTEN, I WAS... I WAS TALKING TO THE BOYS THE OTHER DAY, AND THEY ASKED ME IF I KNEW THEIR MOTHER. WHAT DID YOU SAY? WELL, WHAT COULD I SAY? THAT I'M SURE SHE WAS A WONDERFUL PERSON, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HER. UH, I GET THE FEELING THAT THEY HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HER. THEY NEVER ASK ME. WELL, MAYBE THEY'RE WAITING FOR YOU TO TALK ABOUT HER. WELL, THEY'RE YOUNG. THERE'S A LOT OF TIME LEFT. WHERE ARE THESE SKI... SKATES... WHAT ARE THEY... SKATE-SKIS? WHAT ARE THEY? I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE I SHOULD JUST GET THEM CASH THIS YEAR. THEY'D LIKE THAT. THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. REBA? IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. SETH, THIS IS MY SISTER, VICKI. YOU HAVEN'T MET... THIS IS MY HUSBAND, DOUG, AND-AND THIS IS ELLEN. WE HAVE TO GO. MOM TOLD ME ABOUT THE MISUNDERSTANDING FOR CHRISTMAS. I FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT. REALLY? REALLY... DOUG AND I TALKED IT OVER. W-WE'LL CHANGE OUR PLANS. WE CAN SEE HIS GRANDMOTHER FOR NEW YEAR'S. OH, YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S FINE, BECAUSE I HAVE MADE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS. BUT, REBA... I WANT YOU TO BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS. WELL, VICK, WE DON'T ALWAYS GET WHAT WE WANT, DO WE? THAT'S SOMETHING I LEARNED FROM YOU. I'M SORRY. REBA... YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW BADLY SHE FEELS ABOUT... DOUG, IT WON'T DO ANY GOOD. TAKE CARE. YOU OKAY? UH, LET'S TRY A DIFFERENT STORE, OKAY? THEN MRS. MIRACLE TOOK US, AND WE PUT ALL THE STUFF IN THE CHRISTMAS BASKETS. YEAH, TURKEY AND CRANBERRY SAUCE. AND CANDIES AND STUFF FOR DESSERT, SO OTHER FAMILIES CAN HAVE CHRISTMAS DINNER TOO. YOU GUYS DID A GREAT JOB. I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU FOR HELPING. I TOLD THE BOYS THAT WE'D WALK IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND SEE ALL THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS. OH, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. WOULD YOU TWO LIKE TO TAG ALONG WITH US? YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T, UM... WHY DON'T WE STAY AND CLEAN UP? WELL, THANK YOU. COME ON, BOYS, GET YOUR COATS. HEY, LOOK, UH, JUST, WHAT HAPPENED TODAY WITH MY SISTER, I'M SORRY. IT WASN'T FAIR TO PUT YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT. NO, NO, NO, I'M GLAD I WAS THERE. I SAW HOW HARD IT IS FOR YOU. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I... I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A GOOD THING. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? SHE'S REALLY REACHING OUT. I THINK MAYBE IF YOU GAVE HER A CHANCE... YEAH, BUT, I MEAN, HOW COULD I EVER TRUST HER AGAIN? YEAH, TRUE, BUT YOU CAN'T LET IT CONTROL YOUR LIFE. IT DOESN'T. YEAH, BUT YOU'RE GIVING UP A CHANCE TO SEE YOUR AUNT AND UNCLE, WHO YOU GENUINELY CARE ABOUT, BECAUSE YOU'RE ANGRY AT YOUR SISTER. NO, I JUST, I TOLD YOU THAT I WANT TO SPEND THE DAY WITH YOU AND THE BOYS. LOOK, I KNOW YOU THINK YOU'RE PUNISHING VICKI BY NOT BEING THERE, BUT THE ONE WHO'S REALLY LOSING OUT IS YOU. SO YOU ARE SAYING THAT YOU AGREE WITH EVERYONE ELSE. SO I SHOULD JUST PRETEND LIKE THAT NEVER HAPPENED, RIGHT? NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING AT ALL. I'M SAYING... IF YOU JUST TALKED TO HER... THERE'S NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT. OH, COME ON. YOU DON'T THINK THIS IS HARD FOR HER TOO? I MEAN, YOU SAW HER. I MEAN, KNOWING THAT SHE HURT YOU, NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE YOU? DON'T DEFEND HER. I'M NOT. LOOK, YOU'RE THE ONE I CARE ABOUT, OKAY? I WANT TO SEE YOU HAPPY. UM, THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT I HAVE TO DO, SO... THANK YOU FOR DINNER. REBA... REBA, WAIT. I'LL CALL YOU. REBA... SO THE SET SHOULD BE READY BY TOMORROW. WE'RE IN GOOD SHAPE FOR COSTUMES. SETH MUST BE PRETTY BUSY, HUH? I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM AROUND THE LAST COUPLE DAYS. YEAH. WELL, YOU KNOW, HE'S BEEN AT SO MANY REHEARSALS, HE PROBABLY KNOWS THE SHOW BY HEART AT THIS POINT. YOU KNOW, KIDDO, THESE THINGS ARE GREAT FOR STAYING IN SHAPE, BUT THEY'RE NO GOOD FOR RUNNING AWAY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU TWO? NOTHING. "NOTHING"? AS IN, EVERYTHING'S OKAY "NOTHING"? AS IN, IT COULDN'T BE BETTER "NOTHING"? AS IN, I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK OUT. WHAT? I HAVE TO GET TO BACK TO WORK. I'LL SEE YOU AT REHEARSAL, OKAY? REBA... REBA. HELLO, MRS. MERKLE. I HOPE I'M NOT INTERRUPTING. NO, IT'S FINE. WHAT'S UP? I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD PICK UP THE BOYS AFTER REHEARSAL? UM... NO, I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE TIME. YOU'D BETTER DO IT. OH, ARE YOU SURE? BECAUSE THEY LOOK SO FORWARD TO SEEING YOU, AND I HEAR THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO BEFORE THE SHOW'S READY. I'M SURE THEY'LL BE FINE WITHOUT ME. LISTEN, I'VE GOT TO GO. I'LL BE HOME FOR DINNER, THOUGH, OKAY? WHY DO THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO MAKE IT SO COMPLICATED? OOH! I'M SORRY. GO AHEAD, HONEY. OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MERRY CHRISTMAS. MERRY CHRISTMAS. FIND EVERYTHING OKAY TODAY? YES, I DID. HOLY COW! YOU'RE OUR MILLIONTH CUSTOMER. OOH! YOU WON A TRIP! MERRY CHRISTMAS. OH, THANK YOU! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! SHE WHAT? DON'T TELL ME THAT, BECAUSE, I MEAN, SHE CAN'T JUST BE GONE. YEAH, WELL, THAT'S WHAT HER NOTE SAYS. MRS. DARLING WON A TRIP TO FIJI. THE ONE MILLIONTH CUSTOMER? YEAH. DID YOU READ HOW IT SAID THAT THE WOMAN IN THE STORE LET HER GO IN FRONT OF HER IN LINE? IT WAS LIKE SHE HAD THIS ANGEL ON HER SHOULDER, OR... WHICH IS SO TOTALLY NOT THE POINT, BUT ACCORDING TO THE RULES, SHE HAS TO BE THERE FOR CHRISTMAS, SO... KATE, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? I MEAN, OUR PIANIST IS ON A SLOW BOAT TO FIJI, AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO OPEN IN TWO DAYS. WELL, WE'RE GOING TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO PLAY. THIS ISN'T ABOUT JUST POUNDING OUT A FEW SONGS ON THE PIANO. I MEAN, MRS. DARLING, SHE KNOWS THE SHOW BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS. I MEAN, THE KIDS, THEY TAKE ALL OF THEIR CUES FROM HER, THEIR ENTRANCES, THEIR EXITS, ALL OF THEIR LINES. I MEAN, THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE CAN DO THIS SHOW WITHOUT HER! OKAY. REBA. HI. SORRY TO TAKE YOU AWAY FROM THE MEETING. I JUST, I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU. YEAH, WHAT'S UP? UH, APPARENTLY MRS. DARLING HAS ALWAYS WANTED TO GO TO FIJI. OKAY. I'M HAVING TROUBLE PICTURING HER IN A GRASS SKIRT, BUT... SHE LEFT TODAY. YOU'RE SERIOUS. YEAH, AND WE NEED A PIANO PLAYER, AND NOT JUST ANY PIANO PLAYER, SETH. WE NEED SOMEONE THAT KNOWS THE PAGEANT INSIDE AND OUT. WE... WE NEED YOU. I... I DON'T PLAY PIANO. I KNOW, AND YOU KNOW THAT I WOULDN'T ASK UNLESS IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW WHY I CAN'T. SO YOU WON'T HELP ME? I'M SORRY. SO AM I. REBA... REBA... YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO ASK ME TO DO THAT. YOU KNOW I CAN'T. NO, YOU MEAN YOU WON'T. NO, I CAN'T. MUSIC WAS SOMETHING THAT I SHARED WITH PAMELA. I STOPPED PLAYING THE DAY SHE DIED. SETH, THE MUSIC, IT DIDN'T DIE WITH HER. FOR ME IT DID. AND IS THAT WHY YOU NEVER TALK ABOUT HER? IS THAT WHY YOUR BOYS, THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THEIR MOTHER? THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. THEY MISS HER. YOU-YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE IT BECAUSE YOU'RE MORE INTERESTED IN HOLDING ONTO YOUR GRIEF. YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. SO YOU'D RATHER FORGET THE PAGEANT AND DISAPPOINT YOUR SONS THAN LET GO OF THE PAST? YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE SAYING THIS TO ME RIGHT NOW. YOU, OF ALL PEOPLE. YOU NEED TO TAKE A GOOD LOOK IN THE MIRROR. WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? YOUR SISTER DID A TERRIBLE THING, BUT THE WORLD DIDN'T STOP TURNING. THAT IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT! SHE HURT ME. YEAH, AND YOU TOOK THAT HURT AND YOU LOCKED IT SO DEEP INSIDE THAT NOBODY CAN GET AT IT, NOT EVEN YOU. YOU ARE JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, YOU KNOW? I REALLY... I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND. NO, YOU KNOW WHAT? I DO UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND, BECAUSE I REGRET EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT WENT BY THAT I DIDN'T TELL PAMELA THAT I LOVED HER, AND IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME, BUT IT'S NOT TOO LATE FOR YOU. YOU CAN STILL MAKE THINGS RIGHT WITH YOUR SISTER. YOU WANT ME TO FORGET? I WANT YOU TO FORGIVE. LET GO OF THE ANGER. GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE. THE WAY THAT YOU'VE GOTTEN ON WITH YOURS? WE'RE JUST WASTING OUR TIME, AREN'T WE? YEAH, I THINK SO. OH, HONEY, DON'T... DON'T MOVE. MISS MAXWELL SAID THERE MIGHT NOT BE A PAGEANT. THERE'S NOBODY TO PLAY THE PIANO. OOH, THAT IS A PROBLEM. COULD YOU DO SOMETHING, MRS. MIRACLE? WELL, SOMETIMES THE BEST THING TO DO IS HAVE FAITH IT'LL TURN OUT FOR THE BEST, AND PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT IS SOMETIMES. IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM, BUT EVENTUALLY, THEY FIGURE IT OUT, SO LONG AS THEY DON'T WAIT TOO LONG. DO WE HAVE TO WEAR A DRESS? IT'S NOT A DRESS, DARLING, IT'S A GOWN. A "GOWN" IS A FANCY WORD FOR A DRESS. I DON'T WANT TO BE AN ANGEL! ME NEITHER! HEY, DAD! YOU GUYS LOOK REALLY CUTE. TOLD YOU WE LOOK STUPID! I DON'T WANT TO WEAR A DRESS! THERE'S A PLATE FOR YOU IN THE REFRIGERATOR. AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT! WELL, I UNDERSTAND, BUT I WISH YOU HAD TOLD ME BEFORE. BEFORE WHAT? BEFORE I MADE THE SWORDS. - SWORDS? - SWORDS? OH, YES, SWORDS. WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT ANGELS, THAT'S FOR SURE. ANGELS GOT SWORDS? OH, YES, THEY SURE DO, AND LET ME TELL YOU, SOME OF THEM ARE VERY FIERCE WITH THEM, SO I HEAR, AND A FEW OF THEM ARE KNOWN AS WARRIORS AROUND THE HEAVENLY CHOIR, AND THEY FIGHT MIGHTY BATTLES, BUT ONLY FOR A GOOD CAUSE. WARRIOR ANGELS. THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE! OKAY... BUT, NOW, YOU STILL HAVE TO WEAR A GOWN. AS LONG AS WE HAVE A SWORD. WARRIOR ANGELS! OH, WHOA... OH, CHRISTMAS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AFTER THIS PAGEANT. BE CAREFUL, HONEY. BE CAREFUL. NO! NO, NO, NO, NO! NO! OH... OH, GOD, REBA! LOSE SOMETHING? TECHNICALLY IT'S YOURS. OH, WELL, CONSIDER IT YOUR CHRISTMAS PRESENT. THANK YOU. IT FEELS GOOD, DOESN'T IT? WHAT'S THAT? GETTING SOMETHING BACK, SOMETHING YOU-YOU THOUGHT YOU LOST FOREVER. YEAH. DOESN'T HAPPEN EVERY DAY, GETTING SOMETHING BACK THAT YOU LOVE. SO GRAB HOLD OF IT TIGHT, HONEY, 'CAUSE YOU MAY NOT GET A SECOND CHANCE. MERRY CHRISTMAS, REBA. MERRY CHRISTMAS, MRS. MERKLE. MRS. MERKLE, DO YOU WANT A RIDE HOME? OH... OH, THANKS, HONEY, NO. I LIKE TO LOOK AT THE LIGHTS. OKAY. REBA. HI, DOUG. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I, UM... I WAS... WELL, I WAS JUST WONDERING IF, UM... IS VICKI AROUND? DOUG, WHO IS IT? REBA. VICKI, UM... PLEASE FORGIVE ME. I'M SORRY. I'M... I'M SO SORRY. I'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH. "DEEP IN THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS DAY, "THREE SPIRITS WILL COME "TO SHOW YOU THE WAY. WITH THAT, MARLEY'S GHOST..." HEY, GUYS. I WAS THINKING, UH... MAYBE I'LL READ TO YOU TONIGHT, IF THAT'S OKAY. OH, SURE. OKAY. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO READ TO US, DADDY? IS IT A CHRISTMAS BOOK? UH, KIND OF, YEAH. YEAH. THESE ARE PICTURES FROM YOUR GUYS' VERY FIRST CHRISTMAS. DOES IT HAVE PICTURES OF MOMMY IN IT? SHE'S BEAUTIFUL. YES, SHE IS BEAUTIFUL. HER FAVORITE COLOR WAS BLUE. THAT'S A PICTURE OF THE THREE OF YOU GUYS IN FRONT OF OUR CHRISTMAS TREE. WHICH ONE IS ME? UM... YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW, BUT, NOW, YOUR MOM, SHE COULD ALWAYS TELL YOU GUYS APART, EVEN FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. HOW? RADAR. THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID. SERIOUSLY, THAT'S WHAT SHE USED TO CALL IT. SHE SAID SHE HAD RADAR... GOOD EVENING, EVERYBODY. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR COMING TONIGHT. WHEN MY GOOD FRIEND KATE ASKED ME TO DIRECT THE PAGEANT, I BELIEVE MY EXACT WORDS WERE, "YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME." THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! BUT SHE WASN'T, AND I'M HAPPY FOR THAT NOW, BECAUSE I HAVE ENJOYED EVERY MINUTE THAT I'VE SPENT WITH YOUR CHILDREN. I'VE... I'VE LEARNED A LOT FROM THEM IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS ABOUT THE THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THE THINGS THAT DON'T, AND JUST HOW EASY IT IS TO CONFUSE THE TWO. AND ONE MORE ANNOUNCEMENT BEFORE WE BEGIN TONIGHT. OUR PIANIST, MRS. DARLING, HAD TO LEAVE THE SHOW UNEXPECTEDLY. I COULDN'T ASK FOR TAPED MUSIC TO POSSIBLY REPLACE HER, BUT... BUT SETH WEBSTER HAS KINDLY OFFERED TO PLAY FOR US THIS EVENING, SO THANK YOU, MR. WEBSTER, AND ENJOY THE SHOW. THANK YOU. LISTEN, WHAT I SAID BEFORE, I WAS OUT OF LINE. I DIDN'T... SETH, YOU WERE RIGHT. YOU WERE, AND, UH, VICKI'S HERE. I'M GLAD. I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU. THAT MAKES TWO OF US. UM, C-CAN YOU STAY HERE AND GIVE ME MY CUES? I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. READY?
