Face the wooden target. We'll practise using secret weapons now. The secret to this is speed and accuracy and confidence. Let's begin now. Start... Shoot... Hitting the target is no big deal. Now we'll use live target. Here it comes. Come out. Come out quickly. No need to show any mercy. Shoot them all down. Shoot... Shoot... Shoot... Shoot... Stop. Yun Fei Yang, what do you want? Fourth brother, they're shooting at me, not the target I don't want to be a live target. If they could hit, why need a target anymore? - Right? - Yes... Bastard. If you'll not be the target, who will be? Speak. You can beat me but don't call me bastard. You know who your father is? You deserve to be called bastard. - Right. - Correct? Yes, Yun Fei Yang, bastard... Stop laughing... Beat him... Stop. Why are you bullying him? Sister, we haven't. He was complaining about making too much efforts in helping us practise using the secret weapon. That's right. He also disrespectfully fought with us. Yes, he did... Stop, speak no further I saw with my own eyes. Then you're saying it's our fault. He's only a servant why are you always protecting him? Right, if that's what you say let's get uncle to adjudicate over this. Alright then, let's go. Going to the Hall of Justice? I'm not going, forget it. Fear not, I'll fend for you. "Hall of Justice" Yun Fei Yang, what happened? Speak... speak up. Go on. When practising at the square just now brother Xie, brother Yau and the others purposely shot the secret weapons at Yun Fei Yang and also beat and insulted him so as to injure him heavily. Please look into this matter. We didn't mean it. Right, even skilled martial artists as yourselves are bound to miss once in a while. Right? That's reasonable. Yun Fei Yang. If their secret weapons are so accurate do they still need to practise? You are being unreasonable. Guardians of the law this is unfair. Nonsense. If we were unfair would the chief assign us to be guardians of the law? What's your relationship with Yun Fei Yang that you always protect him? You don't concentrate on your kung fu but consort with him, it's unseemly. Yun Fei Yang. Yes. - Do you think it's not fair to you? - Yes, he thinks so he broke all the boards just now and he said he'll quit the job. He also said if we kept him on his job he would make a complaint. What insolence how dare you show such disrespect. You have broken Wudang's second law creating gossip and also the sixth law. Only your limbs have developed, not your mind. Your punishment is to carry 50 water pails everyday I am sorry. "Disarm yourself" Let's see what you've got I believe you won't disappoint me! Stop. Who are you? Wudang student I heard there's only one female student in Wudang. You are Lun Wan Er. That's correct. And you... Kung Suen Wang of Invincible Clan. Chief of the Tiger Division. What business has brought you far away here? Bringing a gift to Qing Song on teacher's orders. Nonsense. How dare you speak out our teacher's name? Brother, they are bringing a gift to teacher, we shouldn't be so rude. Sister, they insist on bringing their swords how can we break the rule? Then you are wrong. The rule of disarming has been enforced in Wudang since grand teacher started the clan. Bullshit I learnt the sword at seven and killed with it at 12. My sword never leaves me. No one, except my teacher can ask me to take off my sword. Watch me. Stop. By the order of the Chief to ask him in. Where's Qing Song? How dare you! Do you know who our Chief is? How dare you be insolent! Your guest is here, but the host has not shown up yet this is rudeness. Ask Qing Song to come out. The Chief is here. You are Qing Song? That's me. How can I help you? Twenty years ago you were defeated by my teacher. Ten years ago, you lost again. Do you still remember? Of course I remember. Once every 10 years the contest between Wudang and Wu Di is held. It's now getting close to the next contest. My teacher suspects you won't take up the challenge that's why he asked me to bring you this gift. A wrap? What does this mean? My teacher said if you dare not meet the challenge disband Wudang and take this wrap and retire from the martial arts world. Dugu Wu Di is so arrogant. Tell Wu Di that I'll meet him at the contest. Take this back. Wait. Our founder laid down the rule of disarming the sword and has not been challenged for the last few hundred years. No one has dared to defy this rule either. Go now. "Taoism study" Brother, you are looking for me what has happened? Kung Suen Wang of Invincible Clan brought us a wrap. Damn. Isn't it owing to the contest on the 9th September? Yes, Dugu Wu Di was arrogant and asked me to disband Wudang and retire from the martial arts world. Dugu Wu Di is too reckless. He's been recruiting men to strengthen his own power. And Shaolin... Shaolin is declining. Ermei is dwindling in numbers. No wonder Dugu Wu Di is so daring. Brother, it seems that you have no confidence in fighting the contest. Brother I've been defeated by him twice in the past 20 years I've really lost courage. Do you really think that you have wasted your efforts in the past ten years? Unless Dugu Wu Di's Fatal Skill still remains at the fifth level then I have the confidence to beat him. You're afraid it'd have advanced to the seventh level? That's right. Though originating from no polarities Tai Chi forms two. These 2 form 4 diagrams, which in turn form the eight. "Wudang" Your Polar sword skill is really great. If Wu Di's Fatal Skill is at the sixth level you can surely win. What if he has reached the seventh level? Even if he has reached the seventh level you should have no problem in winning him. Brother, I worry that if I lose again. In a fight skills, movements, time, environment, concentration will affect the outcome. Your fear makes you lose well before the actual fight I know. Fight on and don't worry too much. Yun Fei Yang. Why have you put this thing here? Why are you not saying a word? You spoke on my behalf at the Hall of Justice yesterday that's why I've made a pot of congee for you. No need to thank me, I didn't help much I've cooked it for a long time eat it while it's still hot. Thank you, can you bring it in for me please? Alright. Thank you. Oh, you could deliver the congee to me openly why be so sneaky about it? I'm ashamed to see you. Why? You've always taught me how to be a good person yet I've disappointed you. Then you should apply yourself more diligently and stop the others from bullying you I understand. The Chief is leaving. Thanks for the congee, you should go fetch your water. Qing Song, the twenty sixth Chief of Wudang pays respect to the Grand teacher. Wudang and Invincible Clan have a duel every ten years I've lost on two counts and trained hard for ten years. In tomorrow's fight I'll fight with my life winning takes precedence over everything so that justice could be done and the Wudang name be glorified I pray your spirit will watch over me. It's really heavy. One hundred and two, train hard. Chief, I'd like to have a word with you. Go ahead I hope you'll win. Mr. Dugu, it's been ten years. Little would I've thought that after ten years we are the only heroes left. After today I'll be lonelier. It's lonely at the top. When one reaches a certain level, it gets lonely. Regardless the feud between Wudang and Invincible Clan should be resolved today. Qing Song. Have you settled all the Wudang affairs? Not yet. Without Qing Song. Wudang would still flourish. Really? Please. Please. Chief. Get a weapon. Fatal Skill. Chief... Qing Song. My Fatal Skill has reached the eighth level do you still want to fight? No need. It's clear who has won. Alright, I'll spare you again this time I'll give you two years within which if no one from Wudang could beat me I'll come to Wudang and kill everyone myself. Up in the sky, like the sun at high noon. Reports to Chief on the whereabouts of Qing Song I've sent word by the pigeon to keep close surveillance. Awaiting instructions. Our men have been prepared and on command will get to action immediately. Pursue and kill Qing Song. Chief of Yuan Wu Division I await your command. Pass on my order. No one from our clan is allowed to harm Qing Song whoever disobeys will die. Dad Teacher I'll never take others' advantage and be scorned at. You are kind and honourable you deserve to be the king of martial arts I have to train in seclusion for two years during which time my pupils should stay out of trouble. Yes... Step down. Yes. Dad, since Qing Song is hurt why don't we pursue and get rid of him? I've fought him every 10 years and even have won thrice I have my reasons for sparing Wudang. Teacher, what are your reasons? There's a Yen Zhong Tian at Wudang. Yen Zhong Tian? Dad, who is he? Elder brother of Qing Song. Twenty years ago. Yen Zhong Tian was the best fighter of Wudang. He has been practising Silkworm Skill in Wudang. Silkworm Skill... Our ancestors have always been defeated by Silkworm Skill. What about Qing Song? He did not complete his training I don't think Silkworm Skill could be trained by just anyone. Yen Zhong Tian trained for twenty years and even though he might not have completed it he should be close enough. Then that is to say as long as Yen Zhong Tian lives we have little chance of being the top in the martial arts world? This is true only for these two years. When I complete training the Fatal Skill after 2 years I am bound to attain the ninth level by then Yen Zhong Tian wouldn't be able to escape death. Sirs, would you like to eat or do you need lodgings? Lodgings please. Please follow me. The Order. Men form Invincible Clan, don't be sneaky come out. Brother, let's hide out for a while. Fear not, go and take care of mother. Up in the sky, like the sun at high noon. Dugu Wu Di and I have a rendezvous. What do you want? Our Chief has changed his mind and has decided to send you to hell sooner. Who are you? Better not interfere with Invincible Clan. You bully by outnumbering him. I, Fu Yu Xue, can't allow such a cowardly act. Mr. Fu, you'll get yourself into trouble please don't get involved. Sister. Go. Mother... Sister I am incompetent and been beaten by. Dugu Wu Di at the Guan Er Mount contest again I've brought shame to the clan, and I'm here for pardon. Brother, this is the third time in the past 30 years I've asked for pardon in front of the Grand teacher. You have consistently been defeated I'm worried about the safety of Wudang. Winning and losing is common in battles. It's important that the Chief can return safe and sound we can rebuild our prowess in the future. Wu Di didn't keep his promise. It was supposed to be two years but he decided to kill me before that. Luckily hero Fu Yu Xue risked his family members' lives to save me so I could return safely. Invincible Clan is taking advantage of our position. Chief is a well regarded hero it is worth my while to save you even if I die I admire your heroism. You're too kind. What are your plans now? My family members have died I'll leave everything in your hands. Good, it's an opportune time as we need a man like you I decide to exceptionally initiate Fu Yu Xue as our student I pay my respects to teacher. Sister. What are you doing here? Nothing. What are you hiding at the back? Take it out, come on. From whom did you steal this pouch? I didn't steal it. No? Speak, to whom does it belong? It's mine. That's strange, it's yours yet it was on him. That's obvious he stole it. Right, he's a thief, take him to the Hall of Justice. Right... Sister, let me explain it. Here's a letter. Letter? Let's take a look. Yun Fei Yang, a lot of good you've done come with me to the Hall of Justice. Yun Fei Yang... you again? Kneel. Mercy. Guardians of the Rule what has Yun Fei Yang written? Sister, it's best you didn't read it it was written for her, she should read it. Right, you read it out for all to hear. Don't. Yun Fei Yang, you dare to write a love letter you should have the guts to let people hear it. Read it out, loud. My dear, not seeing you for a month is like 3 springs. Three springs? You must have read it wrongly. It should read 'one day feels like 3 autumns' If you can't write, draw a diagram, idiot. Stop this noise. Continue I miss you day and night. You are so beautiful I give you this pouch as a token of my love. Are you reading this right? I don't understand it I read what I see. Sirs, this letter was written by Yun Fei Yang. He can read it out clearly. Alright then. Hear this? Read it out, loud. It is, not seeing you for a day feels like 3 autumns I miss you day and night. You are so beautiful I give you this pouch as a token of my love-Fei Yang. Yun Fei Yang, I must hand it to you you have guts. But even then sister might not like you give back the pouch. Yes. Quickly. Sister, forgive me I don't want it anymore. Yun Fei Yang I am wrong you have repeatedly broken rules and must be punished. From tomorrow onwards you must carry water for a year and recite our rules while you're at it. Remember, you must mend your ways I accept. Stand still... Yun Fei Yang, what are you doing here? I want to see the Chief. Who is making all that noise? Yun Fei Yang pays respect to the Chief. Yun Fei Yang, you are impertinent. Sheng Qing, Mu Qing, leave us. Yes. Yun Fei Yang, what do you have to say to me? Chief, I have suffered much wrong I can't take it anymore. In what respect? I have followed you to Wudang to learn kung fu. But in these years I have merely carried and run around with the target. The brothers do not aim for the target at all but me instead. If once I don't duck quickly enough I'll die by the secret weapons. You are still alive, right? I've been lucky so far but one's luck would likely run out some day. The road to happiness isn't always paved with gold but is often strewn with setbacks. Take this live target for instance it trains one's reflexes. So, does the training include being called a bastard all day? I'll tell them to treat you properly from now on. The Guardians of the Hall of Justice are fools they do not discern between right and wrong. Should something happen to Chief one day our school shall split up. Shut up I am thinking in the interest of Wudang I want you to understand one thing you're only one of the servants we will not allow you to meddle in our affairs. So get out I take my leave. You're only one of the servants we will not allow you to meddle in our affairs. Yun Fei Yang, bastard... "Wudang Jubilee border" Teacher. Why is it that even when I'm so close to you you still do not detect this? If I were your enemy what would be the consequences? You've been bullied again. Has the Chief declined to teach you kung fu? I do not relish that opportunity. His pupils are not that great. One day he'll realize I'm no push-around I hope you wouldn't forget what you promised me. Before your training is complete no one must know of your skills I know. The hurricane sweep. "Endurance" That's good, continue. Brother Fu, is it unpleasant? It's good. You have not listened at all. Brother, you've not rested yet. Sorry. Look at you, so disoriented clean up quickly I'll make another bowl for you. As you wish, but I'll not eat I think he likes you. That's his own business. See you tomorrow. Brother, how do you think this technique compares with. Dugu Wu Di's eighth level Fatal Skill? You should win. In that case. Dugu Wu Di will be no match for teacher? Though Dugu Wu Di has won three times he is cautious about Wudang all because of brother's Silkworm Skill. Look at this move again. Are you alright? Teacher Brother. What's this all about? How come all of a sudden your inner strength is all gone? I don't understand it either. Since I practised Silkworm Skill I've been like this. This has backfired let's forget it. Brother, Wan Er. You must never leak this out should Invincible Clan become aware my inner powers have a problem they'll destroy Wudang immediately. Brother, I have only forty percent of my powers left after two years at most I'll regain seventy percent how could I ever fight. Dugu Wu Di's Fatal Skill eighth level? Do the heavens want to destroy Wudang? Teacher, uncle let's select six pupils with potential and teach them the six secrets in addition to the Dipper formation and vigorous training these two years we might match with Dugu Wu Di. Good idea. But we pass the six secrets to the Chief only. For the sake of Wudang we must do this. But among all the pupils only Jin Sek, Yu Sek, Bai Sek, Yao Feng. Xie Ping are better. There's one short. Teacher, what do you think of Fu Yu Xue? Not bad. Fu Yu Xue is above the five of them and is a righteous person, he is a good choice I fear others might not submit to him. We must save Wudang regardless. - Jin Sek - Here. - Yu Sek - Here. - Bai Sek - Here. - Xie Ping - Here. - Yao Feng - Here. - Fu Yu Xue - Here. We have decided to select the six of you to train separately in the six secrets to fight against Invincible Clan. You must train hard. This time next year you'll fight with me and the best will be the twenty seventh Chief. Yu Sek will train in the throat piercing spear. Bai Sek will train in the 8 diagram pole. Xie Ping will train in the five tigers fist. Jin Sek will train in the dragon palm. Yao Feng will train in the machete. Fu Yu Xue will practise Polar sword skill. Fei Yang, your spear technique is not bad but you need more power, you must train harder. Yes, teacher. Who made the false order and impersonated Invincible Clan to kill Qing Song? It must be Wudang's enemy and has used the opportunity to frame Invincible Clan. Chiefs of Dragon and Tiger Divisions. Yes. An Lok Inn where this happened is under your jurisdiction there should be an explanation for this. According to my investigation the four pupils of the school killed by Qing Song were all impersonators. There were three men and a woman beaten by someone called Fu Yu Xue who saved Qing Song. His own family were killed by the impersonators. Fu Yu Xue? I've never heard about this person. Have you checked the background of Fu Yu Xue? According to the reports I've got. Fu Yu Xue has left with Qing Song. Although we don't have much information about him I know that his mother and sister are from a whorehouse. Where are they now? I've brought them in for further investigation. Good, bring them in. Go... go... How are you related to Fu Yu Xue? Speak. We are just the procuress and prostitute of Flower Brothel. We don't know Fu Yu Xue. Then what happened at An Lok Inn? A customer gave us a large sum of money and asked us to do as we were told. Brother, that means the gang who killed Qing Song and saved him could be Fu Yu Xue's accomplice. True. Fu Yu Xue must have a motive in doing that. Sister, do we have to report to Teacher? Dad is practising I think we shouldn't disturb him. Let's go to Wudang and ask Qing Song to hand over Fu Yu Xue. Sister, let's go. Someone's storming the place... Listen, you'd better hand over Fu Yu Xue or else we'll crush Wudang. Invincible Clan is treacherous and has ambushed our Chief and you have the guts to come here and make demands? This whole matter requires Fu Yu Xue to clarify. Are you giving him up or not? I am here, what do you two want with me? You are Fu Yu Xue? Yes, I am the one who killed Invincible Clan folk. Alright. Return with us to Invincible Clan to settle this. What insolence, do you think you could just take away a Wudang member this easily? If you don't let him come with us we'll use force. Dipper sword formation. This is the deadliest of all formations. Be careful. Come hell or high water we'll face it. This formation is really something once unleashed it could not be contained. After forty nine moves they are sure to die. Who are you? Go quickly. Net Formation. Retreat, let them go. Teacher, they are from Invincible Clan why let them go? Go before Wudang sends their men. Thank you for saving me. Show yourself so Invincible Clan could reward you I saved you not for any reward; farewell. Sister, are you alright? It's him. Since you have showed your face, what's your name? Yun Fei Yang. Sister, let's go. Greetings, young chief. Have you found out about Yun Fei Yang? Yes. Twenty years ago, Qing Song and a girl surnamed Yun bore him as an illegitimate child. No wonder Qing Song teaches him secretly each night yet denies knowing him. Young chief, do you want to get rid of him? No need I have a plan to kill two birds with one stone. According to Wudang's rules. Silkworm Skill could only be taught to the Chief I want to kill Yen Zhong Tien and learn Silkworm Skill that's why I have to kill Qing Song first. Young chief, but Jin Sek and Yu Sek will vie with you for succession to be chief. Then I'll kill them too. Do it tonight. Yes. Who are you? Who is it? Shiau Yau Valley wind, thunder, rain, lightning. What are you doing here? To kill you. "Come see me quickly, urgent business. Chief." Chief, who did this? Phoenix Jade. What jade? In the cabinet. Give this jade to Invincible Clan's Shen Man Jiun. Shen Man Jiun of Invincible Clan. You must practise hard. Chief... Your spear technique is not bad but you need more power, work on it. Teacher. Yun Fei Yang, what happened? Chief... he... Uncle. Uncle has been killed. Brother... Chief. Sister, do you know who killed teacher? No. When I arrived I saw only Yun Fei Yang. Did you do this? Guardians of the law, I have nothing to do with this. Nothing to do with me. Then why is there blood on your hands? He is still holding the weapon that killed teacher. Listen... There's strong evidence and you still want to deny? Tie him up and punish him accordingly. Yes. Everyone, stay calm. Guardians of the law. Yun Fei Yang doesn't know kung fu at all how could he have killed the Chief? Yun Fei Yang, from whom did you learn kung fu? Don't let him escape. A make-shift. Yun Fei Yang, you have stolen our kung fu and killed the Chief, who is behind this? I haven't killed the Chief. Arrest him dead or alive. Sister, sorry. What an unfortunate calamity. Who would expect a cook who came here twenty years ago then a servant who came twenty years later would mess up Wudang. What should we do now? According to me we should find a new Chief to lead our clan. Right, we are facing strong enemies we cannot afford to be disorganised. Our skilled fighters Jin Sek and Yu Sek have already died. There's only Fu Yu Xue who has high morale. Teacher, he... Shut up. Are you willing to relinquish personal attachments and devote yourself to being Chief to prevent Wudang from collapsing? I'll sacrifice everything to save Wudang. This is like a musical instrument with a broken string. Teacher, of all people why him? I have not forced him. Before Qing Song died he has expressed his wish to sacrifice all for Wudang. But I... He knows where one's loyalty belongs. If you love him you should support him. In that case I'll not marry for the rest of my life. Fine, rest early. Teacher. "Thundering Prognosticator" Don't bring it up. He looks like a rogue and an ungrateful fellow. According to what he has done I have judged him correctly. Your prognostication is accurate then. Of course. Otherwise why would I be called the Thundering Prognosticator? I tell you I already predicted Wudang would be in trouble but I was late... Destiny... Let me see... Right, get your money ready... line up. Yun Fei Yang, you can't escape come with us to Wudang and repent your wrongs. Brothers, I didn't kill teacher. He still denies it, kill him. Let me explain. Dugu Fang. Miss Dugu Fang. Mind your own business. You saved me last time I should help you now. Yun Fei Yang. So the masked man who saved Kung Suen Wang and her was you. What's your connection with Invincible Clan? That's obvious. He must be an insider from Invincible Clan. Please don't misunderstand, I... Fear them not. Invincible Clan will brave everything. Listen, you three he is under protection of Invincible Clan you'll have to go through me to get to him. Yun Fei Yang, we'll let you go today. Let's go. Yun Fei Yang... Yun Fei Yang... wait. Where are you going now? I don't know either. It seems I have nowhere to go. You don't have a home? No. What about your parents? They died soon after I was born. So you're an orphan I was brought to Wudang since I was a kid and everyone looked down on me. And then finally framed me as the rebel who killed the Chief. Yun Fei Yang, it seems. Wudang will never let you live. Why don't you come to Invincible Clan so my dad could protect you? No, if I went with you they'll confirm I'm a rebel. It's for your own good at least this could save your life. When the real murderer is found the allegations could be cleared. Fei Yang, hang on to this piece of jade and go to Invincible Clan to look for Shen Man Jiun. Yun Fei Yang, you can think about it I won't force you. Alright, I'll come with you then. The Silkworm Skill was the kung fu perfected by our ancestor Ku Mu seventy years ago and is also our school's supreme kung fu. Twenty years ago the emperor of Bi Luo Fu posed as a cook for us to steal this secret manual. Did he steal it? He sneaked into the Sau Jan library but I incapacitated his kung fu on the spot. Eventually he died in the Frigid Pond. Hasn't Bi Luo Fu been declining? Now the only strong enemy Wudang faces is Dugu Wu Di. The fate of Wudang depends on if or not you can follow the essence of Silkworm Skill. Uncle. Your inner powers come on and off what is the problem? Take a look at the last page about the quintessential level. Uncle, what does that mean? If I could understand it... I'd have perfected the Silkworm Skill long ago. Yu Xue, you have the talent to understand the essence of the Silkworm Skill. Yes, I will do my best. Meeting or not meeting makes no difference. Mother. Fang Er. Miss. - Mother - Fang Er. You've sneaked here again be careful lest your dad knows about it. Dad should come out from solitary training soon. If I don't come to see you I don't know when I'll have the chance again. In fact I miss you, too I really don't understand why dad has confined you here and separated us both. How many times have I told you not to mention this. Mom, it seems you have just been crying. Yes, for a dead friend. Who? Halt. Yun Fei Yang, this area is off limits you are trespassing. I... Fang Er, he is Yun Fei Yang. Yes. He is Yun Fei Yang, suspected by Wudang of having killed Qing Song. Yun Fei Yang, you dare do such immoral deed as killing your own father. Madam, what did you say? Qing Song is my dad? You can't blame Qing Song hid the truth from you. Twenty years ago Qing Song had an affair with a woman surnamed Yun and bore you as a son. But to be Wudang's Chief, Qing Song hid this matter. That's why your surname is taken after your mother. No wonder he taught me kung fu with his face masked. Madam, may I ask if you are Shen Man Jiun? Yes. When my dad died he asked me to give you this piece of jade. It's phoenix jade. Mother, what's your relationship with Qing Song? Why is she giving you the piece of jade? I should answer that. Dad. Dugu Wu Di, why bring up the past? Bitch. Mother. Dad why did you hit mother? Because you're not my daughter. What are you talking about? Dugu Wu Di Shut up. Qing Song is your father, not me. Mother, is this true? You'd better explain such a sordid matter. Twenty years ago. Wudang and Invincible Clan fought every ten years. Qing Song was defeated by Dugu Wu Di's. Fatal Skill and escaped injured. Unexpectedly he came to Green Wave Study I hated Wu Di then for losing his sexual prowess in training Fatal Skill. So I intended to make him angry and I saved anyone he wanted to kill. That's why I kept Qing Song at Green Wave Study and took care of him I never expected we would develop affection for each other. Though we loved each other we kept our distance. The worst thing was not only Wu Di didn't come for me he also said he wanted to conquer the world and would not return if he did not succeed I couldn't stand loneliness so I drank all the time and while I was drunk I had an affair and gave birth to you. During these twenty years I always remembered this shame but I spared Qing Song three times; Yet ultimately he did not die at my hands. Chief, my father already died. If you must seek revenge I am willing to take up the responsibility. You have guts, I'll not spare you today so you'll always remember the shame Qing Song inflicted on me these years. Yun Fei Yang take your best shot and pull no punches. Go ahead please. To deal with you in my capacity would make me a laughing stock. You pick your weapon. Since you'd like to use bare fists. Yun Fei Yang would not take advantage of this. You don't know your own shortcoming. Ninth level of Fatal Skill. Fei Yang. How are you? Mother. Fei Yang. Yun Fei Yang. Mother, how is he? How is he? His kung fu is gone. What's to be done? Take him away and we'll think of something. Mother, it's been a day and a night is there any hope for him? I have transferred my inner chi(power) into him all depends on him now. Brother don't move him. Mother, why is he like this? The poison inside him has been dispelled. Why is he still unconscious? The only way now is to unblock his energy flow. We have to get him out of mortal danger first. Young Chief. Wu Di incapacitated Yun Fei Yang's kung fu. Is he dead? No, I hear he was saved by Shen Man Jiun but his whereabouts are unknown. The Shadow Sword Skill. This manual records thirteen sword techniques. The Shadow Sword and the Silkworm Skill have different approaches but contribute to the same end. It is deadly and immoral yet it's a shame to give it up. It's concealed in Silkworm creed for the right person by Ku Mu priest. There's an intruder... Men. What has happened? Why have you four stormed Wudang and killed our men? Ask Yen Zhong Tian to come out I have an old score to settle with him or you'll meet the same fate as them. Chief. Attack. Uncle Stop. Sirs. What grudge do you bear against me? Why did you kill our Chief? Yen Zhong Tian. Do you still remember the emperor of Bi Luo Fu? Heaven Emperor. Are you Wind, Thunder, Rain and Lightning of Shiau Yau Valley? Yes, we've come to avenge Heaven Emperor. He stole into Wudang to steal the Silkworm creed and he was captured and killed by me he deserved to die what revenge is there to seek? Bullshit, are you going to kill yourself or shall we do it for you? Attack. Get out, all of you. Brother, what happened? The Chief is dead he's dead? Yu Xue. Silkworm Skill. Uncle... Teacher... So you are from Bi Luo Fu? That's right. Heaven Emperor is my grandfather. Teacher... uncle... To avenge grandpa and in order that. Bi Luo Fu can return to the martial arts world I had to do this. Fu Yu Xue, did you kill Chief uncle? Right. Qing Song and the others were all killed by me. Right, attack and kill this rebel. Why don't you attack? Wait. He who defies me dies. Whoever wants to follow come with me. Quick... He who knows the value of life should preserve it. He's right, let's go over. Are you going to kill yourself or shall I do it? Ancestors of Wudang. We are Wudang's pupils; we'll die for it if we can't save it from calamity! Please bless for our Wudang to be rebuild and the rogue gotten rid of. Fu Yu Xue, you'll regret for letting me go today. Don't pursue her, let her go. Listen up, without my orders no one enters here. Whoever leaves without permission, kill him. Yes. Dugu Fang. Who are you? Lun Wan Er from Wudang. Yun Fei Yang. Wait. Miss Dugu, Yun Fei Yang... He has been incapacitated by my dad and has been unconscious for seven days. My mother has been treating him with her inner powers. It's best not to disturb him. He has woken up at last. Yun Fei Yang. Mother... Where am I? Yun Fei Yang. Sister. Mother, are you alright? What happened? To save you, my mother transferred all her inner strength to you I'll never forget you for saving my life. Don't worry, I'll live I'll regulate my energy for a few hours and I'll be okay. Now there's only a group of cowards at Wudang. All the others have died or fled. Fu Yu Xue I'll not spare your life. Yun Fei Yang, where are you going? I am going to Wudang to kill the villain. As your kung fu now stands you'll surely die. Brother, Miss Lun, come in. Yun Fei Yang. When your father was with me he knew our speciality was inner powers. But... he never understood the secret of Silkworm Skill. Hence he gave me a copy of the manual. Silkworm Skill. He hoped I could understand its essence and I did after these twenty years. It needs the convergence of 3 Yin forces to release it's highest powers. What does that mean? I'll tell you in a while. Now let Fang Er demonstrate each move in the manual. Watch closely. The one practising Silkworm Skill must be a virgin boy and has to incapacitate all his own kung fu. The 'yin' of three women flowing into the body will merge with the 'yang' Enter the hibernation state and then come alive again. Otherwise all will be lost. Yun Fei Yang, this is your chance. It's fate. Everything depends on you now. Let's start. Yun Fei Yang, cross your legs and breathe. Ms. Lun, you'll be on right side and Fang Er on the left. Strike your palms together. Temple of the head. Madam, what are we waiting for? Breaking of the cocoon. We've been waiting for three days and three nights. Will brother... He won't die. He is now like a silkworm spinning a cocoon around himself. He will undergo a metamorphosis and come out as a butterfly. He's moving. Yun Fei Yang. You've have perfected the Silkworm Skill. Congratulations. Thank you, madam. Wudang has hope now. For Wudang and my father I have to restructure Wudang. What are your plans? I will find a secluded place and spend a peaceful life with Fang Er. That's good. Sister, let's return to Wudang. Greetings, young chief. Have you got news of Lun Wan Er? We've looked all over Wudang and she is nowhere to be found. Young chief, you care so much about Lun Wan Er have you fallen in love with her? We are only human I'm worried that a love affair might mess things up I've avenged my grandfather. Wudang is under my control. What will be messed up? Qing Song and Yen Zhong Tian were dead I wonder why you don't restore the reputation of Shiau Yau Valley and carry on the unfinished work of the ancestors. If Shiau Yau Valley has to be great we must get rid of Dugu Wu Di of Invincible Clan I am not able to complete my training in Silkworm Skill which Dugu Wu Di dreads and I don't even know if the Shadow Sword can fight against Fatal Skill. Therefore we cannot be rash. You're indeed a wise Chief! Yun Fei Yang, Wan Er. Yun Fei Yang, I believe Lun Wan Er has told you everything. That's right I've come back to clean up the place and to avenge my father. Good, Yun Fei Yang. You want to avenge your father. Yun Fei Yang's kung fu doesn't seem to be incapacitated on the contrary his power has greatly increased I feel that too. Wan Er, what about you? Fu Yu Xue, I know that by nature you are not as bad. However, I cannot forget what you have done. Alright then I won't say more, attack. Fu Yu Xue, it's your turn now. Sister, let me handle this you go and bring uncles here. Yun Fei Yang, you have progressed a great deal. Stop talking nonsense, attack. Silkworm Skill. "Keep Silent" Go out. Yun Fei Yang. Yun Fei Yang. Yun Fei Yang. Yun Fei Yang, you have at last done something of value for Wudang. Yun Fei Yang, you are really great. All my sufferings and humiliations have become worthwhile I knew that you will be great one day, is that right? That's right... Uncles, Yun Fei Yang hoped that you can manage Wudang and carry on the great work of the ancestors. Yun Fei Yang, where will you be going? Travelling all over the world. Yun Fei Yang. Yun Fei Yang. Aren't you afraid of being lonely? Is there anyone who wants to accompany me? I will.
