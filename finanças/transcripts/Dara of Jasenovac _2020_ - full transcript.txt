It's your first day on the job to constable? (sheriff chuckles) - I sure do. I'm fixing to tell you that nigger out in Freewoods causing trouble again, him and that Oklahoma Kid up and down the roads all night long, shooting up the town. - No, I didn't see any sign of shooting when I've come in this morning. - You know damn well, he's the one been behind all the robberies all over the state and way over in Louisiana too. - No, you don't know that for certain. But I will sure find out. - There ain't no finding out, cause I'm telling you. We ought to get ourselves a group together, put an end to this once and for all. - There ain't no call for that. Let's let the law have its way. Son, let's round us up some dinner. Constable. (soft music) - Sir.

She cut me with this, about took off my goddamn head. - I suspect you asked her where he might could be? - More than once. - He ain't gone far. - I expect we should get her down to the jail. - They say Red and the Kid left together, or they go separate ways. - That's the story. - I guess I'd better go saddle up, try to get on the trail before they do. - There's going to be a posse.

We got volunteers from every community keeping an eye out for them. We got hounds-- - [Governor] I don't care what you got. This is embarrassing. He had better not make it out of Jefferson County. - How do you know he's coming this way? - How you think I knows it? Cause I feels it. Just the other day, they almost caught him.

Maybe in the whole southeast. - I don't hunt just anybody, as I'm sure you are aware of. What did this man do? - Well, he's a thief for one. At least that's what they tell me. I know he's a killer. He shot a boy dead, probably not more than 15 years old. Coochie, if we don't stop him, who knows how many more are gonna act like him.

At any rate, he's not getting out of Claiborne County. (crickets chirping) - I wouldn't be so sure. - Oh, he better not. I ain't seen my wife in three weeks.
