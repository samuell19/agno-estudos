Let go of me. ﻿Fucking get off her. ﻿Bastard, you bitch. ﻿Get off her. She won’t go. ﻿- Get off her, I’m telling you. - Let me go. ﻿- Let me go. -I told you to get off her. ﻿You bastard cop. ﻿Audrey l’m here, don’t worry. ﻿Fucking get off me. Dont touch me. ﻿Why did you let her barge in like that? ﻿Let me help you guys. Thaťs cool. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Girls, you should thank the boys, they’re doing your work. ﻿Novinha, did I give you a task? ﻿You’ll weed the soil, where I just walked ﻿to let it breathe, OK? ﻿With Audrey and Justine ﻿Guys, if you need help, come get me ﻿- I don’t want to get dirty. - Everybody’s doing it. l’m ill, l’m dying, l’m not doing it. ﻿- Give your all for ten minutes. - No, it sucks. Come on... ﻿Leťs go... ﻿He thinks we got up to do shit gardening. ﻿- For real. - Fucking joke. ﻿He doesn't give a fuck that l’m ill. ﻿He can shove it up his ass. ﻿- Oh fucking hell. - Don’t worry. ﻿- Love’s so shit. - Yeah, a bit. ﻿Thaťs why I fuck around and I don't do relationships. ﻿I don’t give a fuck. ﻿Hello girls. ﻿- Hi. - Can I come in? ﻿Of course. ﻿It’s been ages. ﻿Iťs true, iťs been a long time. ﻿I was on sick leave, did you know? ﻿Yeah, they told us. ﻿I’m glad to be here, cause I missed you all, a lot. ﻿Really, that much? Well, fuck. ﻿I even missed your swear words. ﻿Fucking hell. ﻿So, l’m curious. ﻿How are you both? ﻿Novinha, did you start seeing your mum again? ﻿I haven't stayed at hers yet, the judge is still deciding. ﻿OK. And Alison? You’re leaving soon? ﻿I’ve still got time. Stop stressing me! ﻿I hope you won’t disappear, cause in childrerťs homes, they say: ﻿we’ll always be there. Then they screw us over. ﻿Iťs true... ﻿They don't really screw you over but... ﻿But you know me, I struggle to call people. ﻿Iťs true, I know. Alright, see you later. ﻿See ya. ﻿- You're such a victim. - No, l’m not. ﻿They’ll abandon us, blah blah blah, bastards. ﻿We don't give a fuck about staff. ﻿Anyway, I'll be there, you know. ﻿Chill, we’ll all be there, we’re a fam now. ﻿- You're a pain, but I like you. - Chill out. ﻿The FAM We know it was very painful for you ﻿when your parents left. ﻿And today, as your suitcase is ready ﻿and you're about to leave, l'm thinking ﻿we should have talked about your parents, to... ﻿Heal the wound a little. ﻿So you could be a bit stronger, maybe. ﻿I'm sure you're strong. ﻿In any case, you're brave, for sure. ﻿But, we're not made to always cope on our own. ﻿Thaťs not true. ﻿Yes, we trust you, but we're worried. ﻿I'm worried. ﻿I’d like to know that if you leave, ﻿you are safe. ﻿But I think that you've done enough for me. ﻿You've always been there, you've never let me down. ﻿I think that you've done enough... ﻿Whaťs happening here is that iťs hard to let you go. ﻿Hard to let you leave. ﻿I get it. ﻿I don’t know. ﻿I really want to leave and... ﻿Get away from everything, so... ﻿And we will let you go. ﻿But I'll never forget you, ﻿and you'll always be my family. ﻿I find it so great to be able ﻿to talk about it with the kids ﻿in a formal setting like an exit interview, ﻿where we talk about how we feel, of our emotions. ﻿Being in tune with our needs ﻿is positive for the kids as well. ﻿I'll use this opportunity ﻿to thank you all ﻿for the work you did, we all did, with her. ﻿I think it was a great investment. ﻿Next, Audrey. Francois? ﻿Briefly, you all know Audrey's situation. ﻿She's been here for two years, cause her parents died, ﻿in a car accident, you all know. ﻿- French kiss! - Don't be shy. ﻿Not just a kiss. ﻿- We'll do a kiss. - Yeah, chill out. ﻿Admit it, you're into it. ﻿- We're deep into it. - Yeah. ﻿- Audrey, truth or dare? - Truth. ﻿Tell us about your first time. ﻿I was 15. ﻿I suggested it. ﻿And it was horrible. ﻿Really? ﻿It hurt so much, really. ﻿- Really? - Yeah, so painful. ﻿Okay. ﻿I heard you from the hallway guys. ﻿Charles, go to your bedroom, I'll be there in 5 minutes, thank you. ﻿Anything to say? ﻿- How old is Charles? -14. ﻿14 years old. ﻿Any thoughts? Can you say something? ﻿I’m pissed off. ﻿Cause my job now is to call the cops. I'll get your blanket back. ﻿Fucking bitch, get off her. ﻿You're all sons of bitches, for real. ﻿- Get off me. - Fucking get off her. ﻿- Let her go, l’m telling you. - Let me go. ﻿- Get off me. - I told you to get off her. ﻿They did a pelvic exam, ﻿then they asked me to leave. ﻿And they said they would be in touch. ﻿In the middle of the night, ﻿maybe, you had called me first, ﻿before calling the police, I would have come. ﻿Maybe we could have just, ﻿explained together, ﻿to both children, cause they're still children, ﻿that since there's a three year gap between them ﻿we indeed have to report it. ﻿Hello. ﻿Lora, have a seat. ﻿Tkank you. ﻿I think we all know that it does happen. ﻿Fabrice, sorry but, we've worked together a long time. We worked together a long time ago. ﻿But I’m really surprised by your attitude. ﻿There's obvious slack in your management. ﻿No, it was 2 a.m. ﻿the intern panicked. ﻿She did both things she had to: ﻿she called me and she called the police. ﻿She called the police first. ﻿We’d have done it anyway. ﻿Iťs the law. ﻿And Fabrice, you've got to explain ﻿the board members how this works, alright? ﻿She must hear that, she’s allowed to have desires, ﻿she’s allowed to have fantasies, all of these, but she cannot sleep with... Although they have responsibilities, they're vulnerable children ﻿that we're helping, and we think you failed to... ﻿But vulneratole doesn’t mean dumb. ﻿These kids, especially since they are vulnerable, ﻿we do our best to protect them. ﻿But if protecting means: ﻿“Thaťs fortbidden... Thaťs taboo”, ﻿whaťs the point? Two children had a sexual encounter, Iťs abominable. ﻿Our reputation is on the line. ﻿Do you unerstand? ﻿- Hey. - Hi. ﻿I’m doing my laundry. ﻿- Is that it? - Yeah, iťs only lingerie. ﻿Iťs better to do a full load. ﻿Thaťs not eco-friendly. ﻿- I really don't care. - Seriously ﻿Can I have a bite? ﻿- My apple. - Please. ﻿Indeed, Charles won’t come back here, ﻿thaťs the judge's decision. ﻿And... ﻿The authorities have decided ﻿that we will become.. ﻿We will go back to being a girls home. ﻿What? ﻿And we might also expand the range ﻿by welcoming younger giris. ﻿How is that going to help? ﻿I’m sorry, but I have to react. ﻿That changes our mission... ﻿I didn't have a say in it, OK? ﻿So, there’s no point... ﻿Do we know if it was rape, or was it consensual? ﻿And if it was consensual, do the authorities ﻿really have the power to do this? ﻿I think we all feel the same... ﻿I don't agree wiith it either, thaťs howit is. ﻿Next, l'd like to introduce Oumar. ﻿- Hello. - Hello. ﻿- Welcome Oumar. - Thank you. ﻿Welcome Oumar. We’ll come back to this... ﻿Should we introduce ourselves. ﻿Or, are we... We can, go ahead. I'm Suzana, 43, pleased to have you on the team. I'm Asma, l'm 24 years old ﻿and I started working here a few months ago. ﻿Again, welcome, and nice to meet you. ﻿Hi, l'm Kenza. ﻿I'm doing the final internship for my social work degree. ﻿I'm finishing in a month. ﻿Come on, don’t pull that face. ﻿You don’t give a fuck, life goes on. ﻿Iťll be girls only, we'll do what we want, ﻿party how we want, walk around in our thongs. ﻿Thongs in our butts, you know. ﻿Like, with boobs and everything. You know what I mean? ﻿Little outfit, “coocooning” night. ﻿Party like, bitch mode and all, you know. ﻿You love being out in your thong, ﻿like a hottie and all, so... ﻿Whaťs the matter? ﻿We’ll be twerking like this. ﻿You know what I mean? ﻿What I fucking mean? ﻿You think I came here to push you in? ﻿Are you serious? ﻿Yes. ﻿Come on, I need to tell you something. ﻿I’m listening. I’m all ears. ﻿You're pissing me off. Please, come here. ﻿I’m listening. ﻿For once, l’m asking nicely. ﻿Please, come here. ﻿Please bro, you're my support worker. ﻿Be cool, we’re in an activity. ﻿Go, go, go... ﻿Not in the water. ﻿- Hold this. - Come on. ﻿Yeah. ﻿I want him to... ﻿You want him to... ﻿- You want him to take you. - Yeah. ﻿- From all sides? - Well... ﻿- Front side, backside... - At least one. ﻿Front side, backside... ﻿Imagine, he’s on night shift. ﻿You can’t fuck staff, thaťs too much. ﻿Why not? ﻿- Well, he’s staff. - Yeah. ﻿- And? - He’s an old man. ﻿- An old man? - He’s old. ﻿- Who gives a fuck about age? - Yeah, as long as he's hot. ﻿Imagine, his dick’s wrinkly. ﻿Like iťs dangly, so gross. ﻿Bullshit. ﻿Basically, you'd fancy my grandad and his fat belly. ﻿I don't give a fuck bro, he's just more experienced. ﻿He’ll take me better than your 20-year-old guys. ﻿I fucked a guy who was 29. ﻿And yet, he fucked me so well man. ﻿I was like “wow”, leťs carry on, you know. ﻿But the guy came and he couldu't go on. ﻿It pisses me off when I want another orgasm right away. ﻿Actually, it depends. Sometimes l'm done. ﻿But sometimes I still want to, ﻿I'm still awake, I'm like “leťs do it”. ﻿Why did you let her barge in like that? ﻿You're the queen of whores. Don't even touch me. ﻿I'm not touching you, watch your language. ﻿Oh yeah, what will you do? ﻿You won’t do shit, shut the fuck up. ﻿What will you do? ﻿OK, there are two options. ﻿Either it gets worse, or we all go back upstairs ﻿to discuss what just happened. ﻿I don't want to discuss, I want to know what happened. ﻿Why did you let cops come in and take her away? ﻿Are you serious? You're there, just watching. ﻿Get off me. ﻿I’m going to hit you, you don’t get it. ﻿You already are. I suggest you stop. ﻿What will you do? ﻿Are you my mum? You're not. ﻿- Stop it. - Go get her and I'll stop. ﻿You know what? You've got 3 seconds... ﻿Shut the fuck up. ﻿- What will you do? - You stop. ﻿Get off me, I told you to get off me. ﻿- Now, leťs calm down. - Calm down? ﻿I’m also upset that she’s gone. ﻿Hello? ﻿Hello, nice to meet you. ﻿Malik, l’m Novinha’s support worker. ﻿We’re here for the work placement. ﻿- Nice to meet you. - Pleasure. ﻿I just washed my hands, sorry. ﻿- Hello, Novinha. - Hello. ﻿Bye Novinha, I’ll see you later. ﻿Cool. ﻿Here, cut it off. ﻿Is it bad if I leave this bit? ﻿Yeah iťs really bad. Take it all off. ﻿- Why? - Do you want to eat that? ﻿No. ﻿Well, neither do customers. ﻿- They need washing first. - Shit, thaťs right. ﻿You know what I think? ﻿She had no right to take Audrey away like that. ﻿She should have told her to call a lawyer, like in the movies. ﻿So, there are laws. ﻿Kenza's duty was to call the Juvenile Police, ﻿iťs the law. ﻿The police need to make sure ﻿that there was no coercion, thaťs the law. ﻿And the police have to do their job. ﻿And you’ll do yours and apologize to Kenza. ﻿Kenza, she’s a fucking fat cunt. ﻿Excuse me? ﻿- She’s a fat cunt. - No... ﻿Insulting staff, Novinha, thaťs a no. ﻿She’s a fucking intern... ﻿You're like our parents and you let a shit intern ﻿who barely arrived in a children's home, our home. ﻿She barely knows us, she calls the cops. ﻿I swear last night I was this close to hitting her. ﻿She can’t do that. ﻿Why didn't she call any of the staff... ﻿She did. She called the manager, the police, ﻿she followed the instructions we gave her. ﻿We would have done the same. ﻿And thaťs it. ﻿You're all bastards. ﻿You're there, trying to be nice. ﻿But really you're all shit manipulative bastards. ﻿Novinha. ﻿We're close to you, we live with you. ﻿But you're in our care and we aren't your parents. ﻿- Sure. - You know it. ﻿We're close to you, ﻿we sometimes behave like your parents, ﻿we say things like your parents, ﻿we've got affection for you, not like parents, ﻿but we try to give you all the affection we can. ﻿But in this situation, the law is above us. ﻿The difference is that you're not my daughter. ﻿Well, luckily. ﻿Otherwise, I swear, l'd give you so much shit. ﻿Novinha, this weekend is a test. Nothing's set in stone. ﻿The judge wants to see how it goes, ﻿step by step. ﻿Just to see how things go with your mum. ﻿If it works, or if it doesn't. ﻿Alright? ﻿Hey, it will be OK. ﻿I'm on call tonight, don't hesitate to ring me. ﻿you need to talk, don't feel well, ﻿or need to calm down. ﻿I'll answer. ﻿And if something serious happened, ﻿call the police, don't hesitate, OK? ﻿Do you believe people can change like that? ﻿Are you talking about yourself or your mum? ﻿- Hi mum. - What are you doing here? ﻿- I’m here for the weekend. - OK, come in. ﻿I’m going out. ﻿- Good night. - Good night. ﻿Can’t fucking believe it. ﻿Who’s keen to cook on Monday? ﻿Audrey, Monday? ﻿- Chicken pasta. - Cheese pasta. ﻿Whaťs your problem? ﻿You and your fucking chicken. No one gives a fuck. ﻿Why are you even here? Shut the fuck up. ﻿I can be here just like you. ﻿Stop arguing, you can each have a day. ﻿Hi, my name is... ﻿Francois, and... ﻿Well, l’m a support worker. ﻿Thaťs it. ﻿My name is.. ﻿I'm Seb, l've been here... ﻿for 24 years. ﻿I’m Oumar. ﻿I've been a support worker for over ten years, ﻿I'm from the Paris area. ﻿My name is Malik. ﻿I've been here for 4 years now. ﻿Third point, we have a young girl coming soon ﻿whose name's Précieuse, ﻿she'll be here soon, ﻿to replace the boys, I guess. ﻿Do you know more... ﻿No, she won’t replace them. ﻿She's taking a place thaťs free... ﻿Anyway, iťs an Emergency Protection Order... ﻿A state of emergency ﻿in which a child is placed, ﻿to be protected from their parents, usually. ﻿So, Précieuse... ﻿This institution welcomes ﻿young people in difficult situations. ﻿And what we offer you, ﻿the main thing, is a safe place. ﻿It means now, you can settle down a little. ﻿Do you have any questions? ﻿- No. - Alright. ﻿Where did they come for you? ﻿At school? At home? ﻿- At school. - OK. ﻿And how did it go? ﻿Did the police inspector come to your classroom? ﻿Yes, he knocked and my teacher called me. ﻿I got up, and I went. ﻿- That must have scared you. - A little, yeah. ﻿- Did he explain what was happening? - Yes. ﻿OK. ﻿Did he say you would go home to get your things? ﻿Yes. ﻿- And at home, was someone there? - Yes. ﻿- Who? - My mother. ﻿Your mum. ﻿How did it go? ﻿She shouted. ﻿They calmed her down, then we left. ﻿How did you feel? ﻿- I was a little sad. - Alittle sad, yeah. ﻿A little too much, eh? ﻿Others here have been through this... ﻿Iťs never pleasant. ﻿But you know why they came for you... ﻿See the greenhouses? ﻿We grow things we eat. ﻿Lettuce, tomatoes. Do you like eating? ﻿Yes. We have hens, they give us fresh eggs. ﻿Upstairs there are flats and rooms ﻿but for now we’ll go downstairs, ﻿to introduce you to the others. ﻿- Hey. - Hi. ﻿- Girls? - Yeah. ﻿Can I have your attention, ﻿to introduce the new girl. ﻿Her name’s Précieuse. ﻿Précieuse, introduce yourself, in a few words? ﻿My name is Précieuse. ﻿Please give her a warm welcome. I know that... ﻿You're very sweet when you try. ﻿I'll ask one of you to check on her later. ﻿Seb, Bintou's in charge of her case She'll call you later. ﻿OK. ﻿For real... ﻿Iťs child abuse, do you realize? ﻿I'm underage too. ﻿He’s more than underage. ﻿What can I say. He wanted it, I wanted it. ﻿And it just happened. ﻿- But you still abused him. - No. He was happy too... ﻿Bro, l'm at the age of consent. ﻿- But he’s not. - Yeah, but dude... ﻿So, iťs child abuse. ﻿was three months younger, ﻿it wouldn't have been rape. ﻿Rape. Legally, iťs rape. ﻿What a joke, man. ﻿When they came and took me in, ﻿they gave me a pelvic exam, ﻿that wasn't rape? ﻿Iťs a fucking joke. ﻿Bro, iťs fine. ﻿The staff are cunts. Calling the cops like that... ﻿Yeah, iťs bullshit. ﻿Sorry girls, good evening. ﻿Iťs getting late, time to put out your cigarettes ﻿and go to bed, OK? ﻿If we don't come, will you call the cops? ﻿- Good night. - Good night. ﻿See you at the station? ﻿Iťs forbidden, you can't touch me. Stop it. ﻿Hello ma'am, who are you? Go with Sebastien please. ﻿I'm the manager here. ﻿You must be Précieuse's mum, right? ﻿I’m sorry, but... ﻿I carn't let you see her. You must know that... ﻿- Leave me alone. - Or I'll have to call the police. ﻿No, l’m sorry. ﻿Sebastien, go inside with Précieuse. ﻿She will go back inside. ﻿And we'll find another time for you to see her. ﻿But not like this, OK? ﻿Either we talk calmly and respect the child. ﻿- You want to take my daughter away... - Not at all... ﻿- Go, go, go. - Shoot, shoot. ﻿Ready losers? ﻿Too easy. Make an effort, please. ﻿- You're doing nothing, she is. -I am. ﻿- Chill out. - We’re winning. ﻿Come on. ﻿- It counts double. - No, no. ﻿- Iťs the goalkeeper. - It counts double. ﻿- OK, it counts double. - OK. ﻿Basically, when I was little, my dad was beating my mum. ﻿And... ﻿In front of me. ﻿And... ﻿And like, when I was really little... ﻿I didn't know it was hurting her. ﻿It was like a game, you know. ﻿When I was nine ﻿maybe a bit more, ﻿my mum had a... breakdown. ﻿So, she was sectioned ﻿in an asylum, well... ﻿A psychiatric thing. ﻿Then, when I was... ﻿Eleven, twelve, or so. ﻿My body started to change. ﻿It started developing, getting some shape. ﻿Yes. ﻿And my dad was getting weirder and weirder... ﻿And clearly, one day he raped me. ﻿And... ﻿At the time, I didn't... tell anyone. ﻿Cause iťs hard. You feel ashamed. ﻿Shame was such a big factor. ﻿I couldu't tell anyone: ﻿“My father rapes me”. ﻿And... ﻿You, why are you in care? ﻿Who's in for truth or dare? ﻿I'm in, but we just reveal something about us. ﻿- Good idea. - No, we ask a question. ﻿- We each say something about us. - Yeah, go ahead. - Can I start? - Go on. ﻿OK, the first time I went to a club, I was 14. ﻿I was all dressed up, full make-up and all. ﻿I had wine, beer, vodka and whisky. ﻿When I came out of the club, ﻿I stopped in the middle of the road. ﻿And I started puking like... ﻿Like crazy, girls. ﻿And my ex was there. We barely knew each other. ﻿Like when you've just met ﻿and you're shy of everything in front of him. ﻿Whaťs crazy is that, he kissed me afterwards. ﻿I had just thrown up. ﻿I said: “Don’t you mind?” ﻿He said: “No”. ﻿I was like, was you, I wouldn't. ﻿Thaťs my truth. ﻿Justine, your turn. ﻿Well, mine is... ﻿You know before, I was living in a rich family, and... ﻿I didn't have many friends, and my truth is that... ﻿I’ve never been... ﻿I love you all. ﻿I’ve never been so close to anybody. ﻿I don't know if counts as a truth... ﻿But really, I can’t see my life without you all... ﻿Thaťs so sweet. ﻿- Iťs the fam. - We’re the fam. ﻿Whaťs “the fam”? ﻿Iťs slang for family, Lora. ﻿I’m sorry, thaťs too funny. ﻿Hey Justine, chill out. ﻿Chill out? ﻿Do you want it in your face or what? ﻿Confiscated. ﻿- Hello Francois. - Hi. ﻿‘Sup chicks? ﻿Huh chicks, are you serious? ﻿I brought my puppet. ﻿- It looks shit. - So. ﻿Well. ﻿- Hello. - Let me introduce myself. ﻿I’m going to do an excerpt of... ﻿Précieuse? OK, leťs go. ﻿Are you trying to give us nightmares? ﻿This is a story... ﻿- He thinks we're still four. - Wait man... ﻿...which is called ﻿“The Cold”. ﻿- Great. - Fascinating. ﻿The Cold. ﻿- We got it... -The Cold. ﻿The cough... ﻿Hey girls, give him a little chance. ﻿Let him do it, so we’re done. ﻿My brother-in-law had... ﻿a first cousin, ﻿whose paternal grandfather had married in a second marriage ﻿a young indigenous girl whose brother had met, ﻿on one of his travels, ﻿a girl he had fallen in love with, ﻿and with whom he had a son ﻿who married an intrepid pharmacist ﻿who was none other than the niece ﻿of an unknown quartermaster in the Royal Navy. ﻿- Don't touch the puppet... - Sorry, excuse me. ﻿- So, leťs continue? - OK we’re done, we’re listening. ﻿But not from the start please. ﻿- Do you do theatre? - Yeah, I do a bit of theatre... ﻿A bit of support work, a bit... ﻿The excerpt I just did, ﻿Iťs Theatre of the Absurd. ﻿After the Second World War... ﻿You know, the Second World War? ﻿- Yeah, with Hitler. - 1939 to 1945. ﻿It ended in 45. ﻿Basically, there were bombs everywhere ﻿and cities were destroyed everywhere. ﻿was a real massacre. ﻿So, the author thought ﻿the world makes no sense, ﻿so why would my plays make sense? ﻿Thaťs it, basically. ﻿We’re all working for you to come home. ﻿If you've made friends, we’re all happy. ﻿If you say she fits in, ﻿I'm relieved, ﻿she couldn't carry on like that anyway. ﻿But you're coming home, you're not staying here. ﻿You need to keep growing up with us. ﻿If I come home, ﻿I'll have bad memories. ﻿I don't want to have them. ﻿Even to talk about it now is... ﻿I'm not coming home. ﻿Justine, if you think about other situations here, ﻿some don’t really have... ﻿Parents. ﻿Whaťs your fear, your main fear, ﻿about going home? ﻿Iťs to be reminded of... ﻿Of what I did. ﻿I just... I’m not coming home. ﻿I have a new family here. ﻿I’m so comfortable. I’m carefree. ﻿You're encouraging this? This is nonsense. ﻿You've been the only one speaking, OK? ﻿Iťs true. ﻿You're right, Mr Robinson, l’m listening. ﻿She’s our daughter, OK? This is our business, not yours. ﻿We’re done. ﻿Could we not meet halfway... ﻿Yes, I hear that iťs your business... ﻿Justine, you're coming home. ﻿Look at me, Justine. This isn’t your home. ﻿Your father is saying that ﻿he wants you by his side. ﻿He’s showing how much he cares about you. ﻿Same for your mum. ﻿Your stay here allowed some distance, ﻿to ease tensions, but all of you are hurt. ﻿Iťs now time, ﻿to do the work, all three together. ﻿You need to discuss what happened, the event, ﻿that traumatized you ﻿Resurface. ﻿And now, propel. ﻿- So, whaťs your wish? - She can’t say it. ﻿Give me a piece. ﻿- You greedy. - True? ﻿Even if she leaves, ﻿we can all see her outside, right? ﻿We’re all friends. We can always see each other. ﻿She could even come eat with us sometimes ﻿- Of course. - There you go. ﻿Iťs not over, you see? ﻿The only difference is she won’t sleep here. We can see you every day... ﻿After school. ﻿I need to tell you ﻿that a letter arrived for you ﻿from the Immigration Service. ﻿And that... ﻿Your asylum request in Switzerland ﻿has been rejected. ﻿I think iťs the third time. ﻿The fact you're now an adult ﻿means this could be definitive. ﻿- Can I sit next to you? - Yes. ﻿you decided to run away ﻿I’m not telling you to, ﻿but would you know where to go? ﻿Have you thought about it? ﻿Honestly, I don’t know. I thought about it once... ﻿If I can’t find my parents and I can’t live here, ﻿jumping in the lake, ﻿since I can’t swim very well l’d drown in no time. ﻿Thaťs your pian? Thaťs it? ﻿Well yeah, so that... ﻿Nobody needs to bother... ﻿Sending me back... ﻿Cause I don’t know what iťll be like in my country, ﻿I’ve not been there in a long time. ﻿And I can’t really speak the language, ﻿I don’t know how I would cope. ﻿So l’d rather die here than going through all of this. ﻿What would your parents think of this? ﻿I’d like to know. ﻿I think that... ﻿you close your eyes, ﻿imagine what your parents would say. ﻿If they found out you killed yourself. ﻿Who will tell them ﻿how far you've come. ﻿How you got by in life. ﻿Everything you've done, the courage you've had. ﻿How... ﻿The strength, ﻿and the beautiful woman you've become. ﻿- Whaťs going on? - She’s pissing us off. ﻿- Easy... - Everyone’s full of shit. ﻿We’re chatting. ﻿- She’s fucking 13. - She’s talking about sex with a kid. ﻿-And? - She’s a kid. ﻿OK now, stop. ﻿You're all bitches. Bitch, bitch... ﻿Novinha. ﻿Don’t throw it. ﻿Stop, enough! ﻿Look at me, and stop. Sit down, please. ﻿- Calm down. - No, l’m not calm. ﻿- Can we talk? - No. ﻿Talk to yourself. ﻿I want this home to be a safe space for you, ﻿not a place where you fight. ﻿- You stuttered. - Yes, because l’m upset. ﻿- Stop shouting then. - You weren't listening... ﻿Iťs normal, you don’t get any respect... ﻿When we got here if I get it well, ﻿Précieuse and Audrey were talking? ﻿- Exactly. - We were chatting. ﻿- Chatting about what? - Sex. ﻿About life... ﻿She asked me questions and I replied. ﻿What were the words about sex ﻿that shocked you? ﻿Dick, and everything... ﻿There was no “dick”, I never said that. ﻿Whaťs shocking you, is that she said this at her age? ﻿Yeah, she’s 13 and... ﻿So before 13, there’s no sex, no discovering your own body? ﻿Well yes... ﻿You didn’t choose to be in care. ﻿But you live together and are of different ages. ﻿It means that Précieuse may learn things a little faster. ﻿not worried about her. ﻿She just shouldn't talk about it here. We don’t have to hear that. ﻿She’s just fucking with us. ﻿She doesu't give a fuck. ﻿No, I don’t think so. ﻿- Whaťs your problem? - Shut the fuck up. ﻿I said dick, and you're a fucking dyke? ﻿I’m a fucking dyke? ﻿Novinha, stop. Get out, now. ﻿Why is it me getting out? ﻿Because, fuck off... ﻿- I’m not going anywhere. - We’re here, all quiet... ﻿- No, you're not all quiet. - Yes. ﻿No. ﻿Caro, she’s fit isn’t she. ﻿- Caro. Caro? - Yes, Caro Caro... ﻿You're friends, how can you think she’s fit? ﻿- I don’t know. - You think of her that way? ﻿- I don’t know, I like her. - You're blushing, girl. ﻿There are sparkles in your eyes. ﻿Shut up, don’t push it. ﻿- Are you in love with her? - I don’t know. ﻿I promise, won’t tell anyone. ﻿I like her, you know. ﻿You like her “kiss kiss”? ﻿Well yeah, “kiss kiss”. ﻿Does she know it? ﻿For real, iťs... ﻿Iťs so weird cause she’s like my sis. ﻿You don’t act like she is. ﻿But at the same time, my heart... ﻿Your heart is naughty. ﻿My hearťs a little bastard. ﻿- Fucking hell. - Don’t worry. ﻿- Love’s really shit. - Yeah, a little bit. ﻿Thaťs why I fuck around and I don't do relationships. ﻿I don’t give a fuck. ﻿- Are you ready bitches? - Yes, l’m ready. ﻿Leťs go. ﻿Am I dreaming?

And where is she this morning? ﻿Right now she’s at school, ﻿she’ll be back this afternoon. ﻿Girls, I have a quick question ﻿about Alison and Caroline. ﻿Do you have any news? They still aren’t back and... ﻿We’re worried. Maybe you have some info? ﻿- No. - No. ﻿You really don’t, or are you pretending? ﻿- Tamra, anything to say? - No, nothing. Why? ﻿They’ll come back... ﻿OK, thanks. ﻿So, iťs potato season. You can gear up. ﻿- Do we need to wear them? - Yes, over your trousers. ﻿Come on, Précieuse. ﻿I bet a spider will come out. ﻿Is there a spider on it? No, iťs all good. ﻿- Iťs dirty. - Iťs spider-free, take it. ﻿There’s one behind you. ﻿Not a spider, a jacket. ﻿Take the trousers and shake them off. ﻿Iťs gross, it was huge. ﻿- Hello. - Hello Lora. ﻿Following the Missing Persons Report you filed, ﻿here are Caroline and Alison. ﻿Alright. ﻿Well, girls, you don’t seem very fresh. ﻿- Thank you for sir. - You're welcome, goodbye. ﻿- See you soon. - I hope not, for your sake. ﻿You're not very sober tonight, we won’t discuss it now. ﻿But, nothing to brag about.

Really. ﻿It happened suddenly. ﻿Iťs not fair... ﻿- I’m not doing your washing-up. - Yes you will. ﻿Chill the fuck out. ﻿You can shove it up your ass. ﻿Shove it up your ass. Are you crazy? ﻿Iťs fine, stop it. ﻿- Why are you being a pain? - Cause iťs the fucking washing-up. ﻿- So what, do it yourself. - They’re the fucking rules. ﻿They’re shit, I don’t give a fuck. ﻿Don’t break my balls. ﻿- I'll fuck you up. - Go fuck your shit washing-up. ﻿Do it again.. ﻿Think you're clever? Chill out. ﻿Do you want to sweep the floor? ﻿Just because I don’t have to do it and you do? ﻿If I don’t want to do it, I don't. ﻿- Stop, go over there. - Don’t do it then. ﻿- Please, go over there. - Get off me. ﻿Why are you being so clever? Fucking bitch. ﻿- You need a knife? - Shut up. ﻿Fucking loser. ﻿Caro, where are you going ﻿Whaťs up? ﻿Can you tell me what you're doing? ﻿Please talk to me, Caroline. ﻿Tell me, what can I do. ﻿How can I help you? ﻿I'm not staff here. ﻿Iťs Oumar talking to you. ﻿I lost my father too. ﻿I couldu't cope either. I could have also chosen to... ﻿To kill myself, but no. ﻿Stop moving, or I'll slit my throat. ﻿I’m serious. ﻿I'm serious. ﻿You can’t go like this. ﻿Is it the image you want to leave behind? ﻿Is it what you want? ﻿I don’t want to leave you. ﻿If someone needed your help, would you leave them? ﻿You know we’ve got cleaners for this? ﻿Iťs a tradition here. ﻿When a kid leaves, ﻿the manager changes the sheets. ﻿Where does it come from? ﻿From the time nuns worked here. ﻿A long time ago. ﻿Lora? ﻿Are you doing OK? ﻿For sure, a lot is going on right now. ﻿Iťs just that... ﻿I feel like you came back quickly. ﻿Like iťs a little soon. ﻿You know that I’m grieving. ﻿It... fills me up. ﻿A little. ﻿Well, it doesn't fill anything but... ﻿I pretend. ﻿Hi. ﻿How are you? ﻿Yeah, l’m fine... ﻿You? ﻿Fine... ﻿You know, sometimes I wonder... ﻿If you still think about her. ﻿- Come on darling. - Hi Paul. ﻿Leťs go. ﻿Are you sure you want to go back there right away? ﻿Yes, of course. ﻿Iťs important to me. - ﻿Love’s so shit. - Yeah, a bit. ﻿Thaťs why I fuck around and I don’t do relationships. ﻿ ﻿I don’t give a fuck. ﻿Hello girls. ﻿- Hi. - Can I come in? ﻿Of course. ﻿It’s been ages. ﻿Iťs true, iťs been a long time. ﻿- I was on sick leave, did you know? - Yeah, they told us. ﻿OK. And my illness was... ﻿Big, big sorrows, a lot of sadness. ﻿Seriously? ﻿Yes, I had to go to a care home. ﻿My husband picked me up this morning. ﻿And I asked him to drive me here first. ﻿Because I missed you all, a lot, and l’m glad to be back. ﻿Really, that much? Well, fuck. ﻿I even missed your swear words. ﻿Fucking hell. ﻿Fucking bitch, what are you doing? ﻿You're all sons of bitches. I told you to let her go. ﻿Fucking get off me. ﻿They’re two children, ﻿who had a sexual encounter, this is abominable. ﻿Our reputation is at stake. ﻿Can you understand? ﻿What you don’t understand, ﻿What you don’t understand, ﻿or what you're not hearing here... ﻿This isn’t only about education, Lora. ﻿You must protect these children, ﻿but you must also be aware of the laws, ﻿and these laws are an issue now. ﻿The press knows about this, even if they lie and the politicians too, ﻿your slack has put this institution in great trouble. ﻿So, first... ﻿I need to tell you that ﻿we’re talking about a children’s home. ﻿About children and teenagers living in care. ﻿A children's home is not a prison. ﻿These children are not locked up, ﻿they are not punished. ﻿They are here to be supported, ﻿to be educated, ﻿including in their sexuality. ﻿Second... ﻿Yes, sex between teenagers ﻿makes adults lose their mind. ﻿And it makes the headlines. ﻿The press loves it. ﻿But sex is not a crime. ﻿It needs to be taught. ﻿Iťs a right. ﻿I’m feeling so... ﻿I’m feeling so much pain, actually. ﻿I was in my room, on my bed, chilling. ﻿And like, he came in... ﻿Then, he locked the door. ﻿And like... ﻿Then, you know, he... ﻿He started coming towards me and everything... ﻿He stank of alcohol.. ﻿was kind of rough, you know. ﻿And like... ﻿Then, he started... ﻿You know what I mean? Like... ﻿He was going really fast, like... ﻿He really... ﻿He really hurt me and everything. ﻿But like, really... ﻿It makes me feel kind of... ﻿Really sad. ﻿And... ﻿Like... ﻿Yeah it... ﻿It makes me sad. ﻿I tell myself, fuck... ﻿How can your own father do this. ﻿And... ﻿Yeah like, iťs... ﻿Iťs mad. ﻿Like, that guy... ﻿He took my virginity like, so badly. ﻿And like... ﻿I say that guy cause, for me, he’s not a dad, you know. ﻿He’s a fucking bastard. ﻿And like... ﻿For real, l’d love to... ﻿Find my dad, and actually smash his face in, but... ﻿He’s not even worth it. ﻿For me, your mum is a fucking bastard too. ﻿And you? Why are you in care? ﻿Well... ﻿I was about 12 ﻿when my sister was born. ﻿Her name.. ﻿Her name was Magali and.. ﻿Well, basically... ﻿One night, I had to look after her, and... ﻿My parents went out. ﻿And... ﻿So, I ran her a bath and.. ﻿I put her in the bath, and... ﻿Then, I... ﻿I went back downstairs to finish preparing food and... ﻿Then.. ﻿Then, well, I went upstairs... ﻿- Where are you going? - Sorry, I didn’t hear my alarm. ﻿- Do you know what time it is? - I didn't mean to. ﻿We’re busy and you show up like this. ﻿Fuck off, door’s over there, bye. ﻿Whaťs that! Thaťs not the way we work here. ﻿- I’m really sorry. - I'm not having it. ﻿I don’t give a fuck, you're out, we’re done. ﻿But sir, I really need this work placement. ﻿First, "sir” my ass. ﻿- I mean chef. - Iťs chef, OK? ﻿I understand. Iťs the last time, I promise. ﻿I said we’re done. I’ve already got help. ﻿Bye. You can leave. Go. ﻿Goodbye. ﻿- You're such an asshole. - What did you say? ﻿You told me to fuck off. Who do you think you are? ﻿Being a chef makes you the king of the world? ﻿I’m the boss, OK? This is my place, fuck off. ﻿You're a chef, not my father. Who gives a fuck. ﻿Go on, get out. We’re done now. ﻿- Don’t touch me. What will you do? - Calm down. ﻿- Don’t touch me too, you bitch. - What, bitch? ﻿- Get off, let me leave. - Breathe. ﻿I heard what happened. ﻿Can you explain it to me? ﻿Please? ﻿OK. ﻿You know what? ﻿I'll tell you somethmg. ﻿I also feel anger inside. A lot of anger. ﻿A huge amount of anger. ﻿My daughter, she wasn’t even 40, ﻿and she killed herself. ﻿I’m angry because I didn't do what I had to. ﻿But deep down... ﻿Iťs only sadness. ﻿Keep it. ﻿Iťs a good apple. ﻿- From the garden? - Yeah. ﻿So. What was I doing? ﻿- Oumar? - Yes? ﻿What happened with Caro last night? ﻿Why do you want to know? This isn’t the right time. ﻿I think it is, because she lives with us... ﻿Yes. Would you like it ﻿if I talked behind your back? We must be honest with you, so be honest with us ﻿and tell us where the fuck she is. ﻿The question here is, why is Caroline not here? ﻿We’d like to know if she’s OK? ﻿She’s OK, she’s safe. ﻿Right now, we can’t tell you more. ﻿We owe you respect and you owe us respect. ﻿We’re honest with you when we go out. ﻿Be honest with us, and fucking tell us. ﻿Caroline has lost her dad. ﻿And she attempted suicide. ﻿So when the staff tell you that she’s safe, ﻿it means that: no, she’s not OK, ﻿and she was admitted to a psychiatrie ward. ﻿I don’t know what you all think, ﻿it would maybe make her happy to get a card from us. ﻿It would take her mind off things. ﻿You didn’t want to tell us what happened and now you want us to write a card? ﻿Seriously. ﻿Now that everyone knows, ﻿what can we do to make her feel good? ﻿You guys are so full of shit iťs crazy. ﻿Yeah, iťs mad. ﻿If you're too sensitive to tell us whaťs happening ﻿you're just not cut out for this job. ﻿Yes, thaťs true. ﻿- Why do you even do this job? - Seriously. ﻿We don’t have a family, this is our only family, our home. ﻿You're saying: “We're here for you, blah blah blah” ﻿but in the end, we’re always struggling on our own. ﻿We want to... ﻿And our mission is to protect you. ﻿And... ﻿I think we’re in a system where.. ﻿We do it the wrong way. We can do it wrong. ﻿You talk about protection? ﻿You think you can protect us ﻿when you couldn't protect your own daughter? ﻿- Stop it. - Why did you say all this? ﻿Hello ma’am, who are you please? ﻿Go to Sébastien please. ﻿I’m the manager. ﻿You must be Précieuse’s mum, is that right? I﻿’m sorry but... ﻿I can’t let you see her now. ﻿You must know that. ﻿Leave me alone. ﻿Or I'll have to call the police. ﻿No, l’m sorry. ﻿Sébastien, go inside with Précieuse. ﻿She will go inside with her support worker and... ﻿We’ll find another time for you to see her ﻿but not like this, OK? ﻿- Bitch. - Excuse me? ﻿I’m sure no one fucks you anymore. ﻿So, Précieuse. Your social worker is here. ﻿And Malik and I, ﻿we want to understand, and find out what really happened. ﻿We’re listening, so you can tell us. ﻿What can I say, for you to tell us? ﻿To reassure you, for you to trust us? ﻿Do you have something to tell us? ﻿Sorry... ﻿Sorry I lied. ﻿Hold on, I’m trying to understand. ﻿Cause I believe I missed some information. ﻿So Précieuse, what you said about your dad, ﻿it wasn't true, it was a lie? ﻿- Yeah. - Alright. ﻿Could you explain, why you made this up about your dad? ﻿Could you explain, why you made this up about your dad? ﻿Cause I was tired of looking after my mother. ﻿Can you give us more details? ﻿was doing everything for her. ﻿You mean, you were cooking? ﻿What else? ﻿Everything she had to do, I was doing it. ﻿When she wouldrft come o parents’ evening, ﻿I said she was in hospital, I lied. ﻿To be clear, the story with your dad ﻿was an excuse for you to come here. ﻿But whaťs in your heart, ﻿iťs this feeling of not mattering to your mum, right? ﻿Seb, first of all, is she... ﻿Lora, l’m sorry, ﻿but you're not allowed to be here. ﻿I apologize. ﻿But really, you must go. ﻿I understand your need to be here. ﻿But right now, ﻿we need to talk about the aftermath. ﻿After you leave. ﻿And... ﻿won’t be possible if you're here. ﻿No. ﻿I apologize for my colleagues’ reaction... ﻿Iťs not appropriate at all, ﻿for me you have the right to be here, we have cake... ﻿We have coffee.. ﻿Lora, l’m sorry. ﻿But right now, you must leave. ﻿And don’t make me call the police. ﻿Will it have to come to this? ﻿Lora’s made a mistake. OK iťs serious... ﻿But we can’t accept this, iťs not possible. ﻿Seb has an issue with rules, he mixes it all up... ﻿Oumar, you just got here... ﻿Yes, iťs been a week and I wonder where I ended up. ﻿Iťs the law, Seb. ﻿I will leave. ﻿However... ﻿I need to... ﻿An important chapter of my life is closing here. ﻿We’ve worked together for a long time, ﻿we’ve experienced important things, ﻿difficult things lately... ﻿And before leaving, I needed to say thank you. ﻿You aren’t guilty of anything. ﻿I’m the one who... ﻿- I’m sorry. - Sorry... ﻿Go Lora, go. ﻿Thaťs it. ﻿What do you want, her job, is that it? ﻿Iťs not about her job. Iťs an injunction! ﻿- You think you can take her job? -I dlon’t have a choice... ﻿Is your career all that matters? ﻿Are you serious? ﻿- Lora, I promise we’ll discuss... - You're sick. ﻿Just, shut the hell up. ﻿- Don’t tell me to shut up. - Shut the fuck up... ﻿Please guys... ﻿- Malik, you're insane... - Iťs hard for me to do this. ﻿Fuck you. ﻿- Fuck you too, asshole. - Fuck me? ﻿You won’t teach me how to do my job, fucking asshole. ﻿- Can I say my truth? - Go ahead. ﻿Go on. ﻿My truth is that, if I get with a lot of guys ﻿iťs because I feel like it fills a void. ﻿Why do you say that? ﻿I don’t know, iťs inside me. ﻿Does this situation make you suffer? ﻿I don’tknow, actually... ﻿Before my parents died, it wasn’t like that. ﻿But if I could just be loved... ﻿Thaťs so moving. You have my love. ﻿So, me... ﻿Well... ﻿I spoke badly to someone around this fire. ﻿And actually... ﻿though I meant it, ﻿I think that... ﻿I did some soul-searching, and told myself... ﻿Maybe I messed up, what I said was a bit too... ﻿Too nasty. ﻿It was too much, ﻿I went a bit too far and... ﻿And I blame myself because... ﻿Yeah, thaťs it. ﻿I’m not like that, I don’t like hurting people and... ﻿Then I feel guilty for weeks, so... ﻿I just wanted to say that. ﻿Thank you. ﻿You're welcome. ﻿Well, you see, iťs... ﻿Iťs maybe the time for me to tell my truth. ﻿I didn’t know where to start, but you helped me. ﻿You were absolutely right. ﻿Iťs true that, I didnt protect my daughter. ﻿In fact... ﻿When she was a teenager, ﻿She came back from holidays at her grandparents. ﻿And she told us that her grandpa, ﻿her grandpa was my father, ﻿had done things with her that were... ﻿That were wrong. ﻿Clearly, he had abused her sexually. ﻿She tried to tell us with her own words, and... ﻿I think it was so unthinkable for us that... ﻿We didn’t... ﻿We didn’t listen properly. ﻿We didn’t believe her. ﻿And I think the worst thing I did in my life is that... ﻿The following summer... ﻿I sent her again on holiday at my father’s. - ﻿Hello Malik. - Hello. ﻿This is an Emergency Protection Order admission.
