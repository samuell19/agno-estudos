- What was that? - What was what? - Didn't you hear that noise? - Julie, there's no one around here but us. - It's been a nice evening so far. I don't think you get the picture. - What's the matter with you anyway? - I don't believe this. - Come on Julie. - Look, I told you that I didn't want to come down here, and I told you that I didn't want you drinking in my car. So, you come on Skip. - Hey. Why'd you throw my beer out for? - You know, I'm just trying to make a point. - Why you so up tight? - I'm not up tight. - Okay, forget it. - Look, Skip, let's not fight, okay. Let's just get outta here. Uh-uh pal, you're cute, but you're not driving my car in that condition. - What condition? So, I had a few beers, so what? - A few beers too many. I'm driving home. - Terrific, terrific, drive your own God damn car. - A few beers he says. Let me drive you home. Skip, where are you? God dammit Skip, I'm leaving with, or without you. Ooh. - Go ahead, enjoy your way home. - Eddie, where the hell are you. Eddie, Eddie.

We no sooner move here, and you're already getting into trouble. - Aunt Trudy. - Don't you Aunt Trudy me. If you'd listen to what they teach you in school, you'd probably learn. - DOS. - What did you say? - DOS, disc operating system. - Don't get smart with me. - Well, that's what they teach you. It's all bullshit. - That's it. I've had it. You can talk to your uncle when he gets home. - Talk, forget it. We don't talk. - My mistake, actor seven into are Robert, then five charlie. Come, one, two, four, five, two, zero. - Seen it all now. - Listen, we don't want this leaking to the press. We don't know what we've got here. We don't wanna scare the shit outta the community, you know? You understand? You understand Commitski? - Sure Sarge. - Hey Joelie. Come here Joel. - Yeah Joel, wait for us. - Great, not today, please not today. - Come on Joel, we just want your advice on our computer programs. - Yeah, like, where we might have left them. - Well, the assignments due today. You're too late. - Right. - Listen, don't do that. I need that. - I think it's mine Tim. - You don't know. - Look at that Julie, they're at it again. - Hold my books. I'm gonna go help Joel. - I'll give you half. - You're ruining it. - Hey man, come on. It's not worth it. Simmons would never believe we did that program. - Thanks. - Come on. - See you around, pal. - Come on Julie, he's not your type. Besides, what would Skip say? - Skip, his opinions the last thing I need. Why do they always pick on Joel? - You certainly sound like shit today Commitski. - Third midnight shift in a row Sarge, I can't wait to get home and sack out. Hey, I just got a call about a pack of wild dogs. They jumped old man Jessop's pet shepherd. Left that pooch in a puddle in it's own back yard. - Jessop, that loudmouth. Shit, this means he'll raise a big stink at the town meeting, no police protection in the neighborhoods, and all the usual crap. - Yeah, well, I'm outta here in a half an hour when Baker shows up. And, since we're a little short on manpower, I was thinking that you would cover Jessop's call for me. - I've got something more important to do. Listen, why don't you stop by Jessop's, and see if you can get some leads. - Come on Sarge, I don't need a case of rabies. Give me a break, huh? - We've had three calls in the last 48 hours about wild dogs. So, I'm telling you none of us are gonna get any sleep until we get them picked up. You wanna do another five nights on the graveyard? - No, I don't wanna do another five nights on the graveyard. - Okay then, and Commitski, get your feet off my desk. - How'd he know that? - Hey man. - Oh. - How was that game? - Right. - Hey, how's it going man? - Hey. - Good. - Hey, where's your sex fiend fried Skip today? - I heard Skip partied down all weekend with Julie. He's probably still trying to recuperate. - Oh, yeah. - Cool, that's sweet. - Bring it on baby. - Eat shit and die. - What a bunch of jerks. - That's disgusting. I don't believe those guys. - And Deirdra. - And we all know what her reputation is like. - Yes. - Well, I had to give up another job this weekend to work on those two programs for Simmons class. - Oh what a drag. You know, Mr Harrington wasn't as tough as this new guy. - Not on you. what do you mean two programs? - Didn't we have to do two? - No, we only had to do one for today. - Are you telling me I gave up making money to work on a second program I don even need? - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Did I hear what I thought I heard? Somebody up there likes me. Hi, you're Julie aren't you? You're in my computer class right? - I think so, well, yeah. - So I was playing with my band over the weekend, and I didn't get to finish my computer program. And well, I overheard-- - Hey, punk boy, forget it. She's outta your territory asshole. - Yeah, he's gonna make mince meat outta you weirdo. - Come on guys, let's go. Come on. - Watch it, he might have a switch blade. - Let's kick his ass. - Maybe we should kiss his ass. - Yeah, come on Brady boy. - Just ignore those assholes. - Hey, punk boy, we're talking to you. - You asshole. - Come on, do it man. Do it man. - Cool it. - What's the matter with you? - He's trying to use my head as a backboard, man. - Come on, cut it out. Cut it out. I thought it might be you, and you should know better. I wanna see both you gentlemen in my office. Now, move. - Your ass is mine buddy. - Yes, may I help you? - Sargent Patrickson, of the Fairview Police Department, are you Mr. Harmon. - Yeah, I'm Dan Harmon. This is my wife Joan. - Oh my God, Skip. - I need to talk to you about your son. - Thank you. - This is a very well designed program I must say, Mr. Jessop. Will you please explain it to the class? - Well, basically it allows you to accept random data, correlations, and recurring information. It allows you to correlate the data several ways, and display graphs. You can organize it any way you like. It could be handy for anyone who wants to categorize random data to form patterns. - Excellent, perfect example of the complex nature of a very simple machine, the computer. Merely a vast processing network of electronic pulses based on the binary system. You know, a computer can only really do two things. And what might they be, Mr. Naustrom. - Shit. - I'm sorry Mr. Naustrom, I didn't quite catch that retort. Would you like to repeat it for the entire class? - Oh, no. - I didn't think so. Can you help us out, Mr. Jessop? - A computer at it's simplest, can only turn a cell of memory on or off. - On, or off, very simple, extremely basic. - Just like you dickhead. - Perhaps we can see your program. - I ah-- - He doesn't have one. - You stole that you freak. - Bullshit. - That's enough. That's enough. That is enough. Well, I will say this once, and I will say this only once, and that is as long as you are students in this classroom, you will act like civilized. Or, you will not be students in this class. Is that understood? - What an asshole? - Yeah, well what'd you expect? You don't punch a player out right in front of the coach. That was really stupid. - Hey, who's side are you on? He clipped me, he deserved it. - Come on, chill out. It's only for a week. - Cut his own throat, man. You guys will never beat Westmont without me. - Yeah, right. Let go get a pizza. I'm starved. - Nah, I think I'm gonna take a walk to kind of calm down. - Deirdra, I know what you're hungry for. - I got your pizza right here. - Yeah. - Hey Deirdra. Hey buddy, are you okay? Oh, shit. - No, wait, wait. So, she puts her leg up on the seat, see. I mean this broad is big. - I see the city council is still in session. You boys think you can handle another round? - Handle what? - We can handle anything you can dish out honey. - I doubt it. - Hey. - Come back here. - Hey, we've been working hard. - God dammit I want some service. - Didn't we tip her last Christmas? - Yeah. - Hey Chuck, isn't that your kid out there? - Oh shit. That's his nephew. His parents were killed. - Sort of a foxy, competed-- - So? - Hey, come here. - A Houdini. - Oh Shit. I'll see you later all right. - Hey man, keep your ass outta trouble man. - I gotta get back to practice, I'm late. - Oh, you hear that? He's late. I'll talk to you about being late. How about never showing up? You know your aunt Trudy had supper around the table til eight o'clock. - I tried to call. I'm sorry. - Don't give me that. Hey listen, I'm talking to you, fella. Now, what's all this shit about the probation officer, and school, and staying out all night, doing God knows what? - There's nothing wrong with what I do. - Yeah, you know, if you'd study a little bit, you might get yourself a decent job. - A decent job, so I could end up like you? - Look pal, there's nothing wrong with what I do. - Right. - There's something about that kid that just ain't normal. - I got a female warrant. Injury 211. - I was walking my dog, and I found the body. - what time was that, mam? - Approximately an hour ago. - Thank you. - It's very much like the last one. They're putting the body in the ambulance now. Okay, I'll call you later. Over and out. Well, what have you got Commitski? - The lady was walking a dog down the alley, comes by this point here, looks over, and sees the body. - This ones in worse shape than the last one. - What do you think it is? - I don't know. This one was attacked by something, or someone, with unbelievable strength, ripped his throat right out. - Hey, what took so long? Where you been? Beating on so jockos or what? Hey, well, we've been prating that new tune. Hey listen, where is the a bridge come in, after the first verse, or the second? Hey man, you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Gotta kick ass tonight, it's our last night. - That's right. - Wrong, you guys are booked for the next four weeks. - No shit. - No shit. - Doors picking up, and I need a good band in here. In fact, I need you guys as much as you need me. So, starting next week, we raise the cover, and you get 20%, plus your fee. - Check that out, 20% of the cover. Hey Vince, we're not gonna let you down guy. - You guys are good. You're gonna go somewhere. - Tell that to my uncle. - Class ran yet. - Yeah. - Oh yeah. - Hi. So, what time should I pick you up tonight. - Why don't we meet at the park? I'm gonna be busy til late. - Fine. My back seats real comfortable, and roomy. - Forget about your car. I like the woods, there's more privacy, you know. Listen, you just supply the blanket, and I'll supply the heat. - So, where do we meet? - Don't worry, you'll find me. You better go hide. Here comes some more of your buddies. - Why are you bothering with him? - I have my reasons. - Hello. Deirdra, is that you? All right Deirdra, I know it's you. I'm gonna count to three. If you don't come out, I'm coming in. One, two, three, ready or not, here I come. Cute Deirdra, but it's cold out here. Let's stop playing games.

I'm going out for cigarettes. You two want anything? - Yeah, I'll go with you. I'm not on for a while. Listen Jimmy, start with your songs. I'll be back for the third tune. - Let me have your attention please. May I please have your attention? First of all, I wanna thank the neighborhood watch group for asking me to come here to talk tonight. Thank you. I'll get right to the point. There's been a lot of concern the past few weeks about wild dogs in the streets, and rightfully so. I just want you to know that your police department is working around the clock to settle this problem. - Is that so? Go on and tell him now there's nothing to worry about. If there's nothing to worry about, then why am I planning my son's funeral. - Mr. Harmon, I'd like to offer my-- - What, condolences? And why are the police trying to cover up my son's death. Afraid you might scare everybody? How could a pack of wild, wild dogs do this? - Tell us what's going on. - Are our children in danger? - Of course there's danger. - I've been trying to tell you. We have the problem under control. - Julie, are you gonna be okay. I'm sorry about Skip. I knew you were close. - It's all my fault he's dead. I never should have left him. - It's not your fault. - We had a fight. I wouldn't let him drive because he was drunk. So, he got out and walked. - That was Skip's decision. Julie, listen to me. It's not your fault. - But, I heard noises and growling. Why didn't he get back in the car with me? I tried. I shoulda made him. - How could you have made him? - It just doesn't make any sense. - It's been a very tragic week. Skip Harmon meant so much to all of us. Now Tim, Richard is missing. This is wrong, terrible, and we are all responsible. - Is he out to lunch? - We walk around with our heads in the sand, pretending what we don't know won't hurt us. As if we're the machines, as if we're the computers, as if we can turn our emotions on or off at will. - Mr. Simmons, we're supposed to get out early for the services, you know. - Class dismissed. - It's okay. - Thanks. - Deirdra, didn't you meet Richard at the park last night? - Shh, I didn't see anyone. - I don't know anything, got it? - I don't believe, Richard. - Poor Julie, poor Skip. - Julie. - Hi Joel. - Hi. Somethings been bothering me, and I was wondering if I could sit down and talk to you for a minute? - Sure, have a seat. - Oh well, I don't know quite how to say this. But, it seems like everyone's forgotten about it all, a couple of deaths, a few disappearances. - Yeah, life goes on, like there's nothing more to worry about. - Yeah, well, I think everyone's missing something. - That's exactly what I've been thinking. - Really, a piece of the puzzle just doesn't fit. - Shh, this is a library you know. - I have a couple of ideas on how to piece this together. So, maybe we could meet tonight at seven o'clock, and talk about it. - I'd like that. - Great. - So, Julie, now that you're single, how would you like to take a real ride? - I'd rather stick needles in my eyes. - I heard my dad talking to the cops the other night. You know that neighborhood watch thing? - Yeah. - The whole thing just doesn't make sense. I don't think there were any wild dogs in Fairview. - What are you saying? - Okay, one day the cops announced they caught all the wild dogs. Well, what did they do with them? And, did anyone ever even see them in the first place. I think when the killings stopped, they just pretended everything was fine. What else could you logically do? Have the whole town afraid to go out at night? - I hope you're wrong. - I don't know. - You'll have the rest of the class time to work on your programs. And remember, all data can be processed if your programs are organized correctly. - We have to get ahold of the same information the police had, and process it correctly. - How do we do that Sherlock? - Well, they must have a ventral computer they work from. I can retrieve that information easily. - You can? - Yeah, all I have to do is break their security code and tap into the mainframe computer. They'll never know. - We're not talking another war games here, are we? - Mr. Jessop, Ms Martin, I'll expect your programs in 20 minutes, if that not too much to ask. ♪ That was a long shot, but I'll do my best ♪ ♪ Let's rock and roll all night ♪ ♪ To hell with the rest - Looks like things are easing up.

You just have 10 minutes to go through all those papers. - Yeah well, this is real time consuming doing this by hand. - And expensive making all these copies. - Look, I know you have the same information on your computers. If I could just use one of your terminals for just a few hours, I could retrieve this data real quick. I could access your database and transfer it to my discs. I've got my own discs. - That's out of the question. We can't allow a student to play with our computer system. This is a very complicated and expensive machine, young man. No, just can't seem to think to ask that question. - Very expensive and complicated machine young man. She probably doesn't know a microfiche from a tuna fish. - Yeah, well, we've got 10 minutes, so. - 47 year old Fairview resident, Jack LupenskI, was found brutally murdered on the city's north side late last night. An unusually high alcohol level in Lupenski's blood have police suggesting that his intoxicated state may have effected- - You know, if you'd study a little bit, you might get yourself a decent job. - They will not express the case any further. - Decent job, huh, so I could end up like you? - Hey look pal, there's nothing wrong with what I do. - Yeah, right. - Okay, what else do you have? - Well, heres some more weird stuff. It may not even be related. Well, let's put it into the computer and see what happens. I also tapped into the state wide news reports. - Heres two dog mutilations in Lewis County, three missing children last month in Callas County, and they think some squirrels were poisoned here in Fairview. I don't know about that. - Well, dead squirrels are dead squirrels. Let's see, what else have you got. Keep going. - Remember these headlines? Makes you feel real secure, doesn't it? - Well, what else have you got. - Well, howling dogs, a rash of vandalism, and some lady said she even saw a large wolf, claimed it stood on two legs. - Oh, that good. That's all good. Wolves, dogs, okay, what else have you got? - Well, then there's Eddie's uncle, Tim, and Richard, and Skip. - Okay, and Skip. Julie, you all right? - Thanks for being such a good friend, Joel. - Mr. Jessop, and Ms Martin, am I to assume you're doing your homework? What's this? Mutilated squirrels, wild dogs, and what do we have here? Eddie Lupenski's police record from Chicago. - Yeah, well, I was just demonstrating a data gathering system that I programmed for class. - I would have thought you had more sense, a member of the student senate, breaking into my classroom. - Well, no, it's a personal project of my own. You know, I'll take full responsibility. - You'll take your papers, and your programs, and you'll leave the premises. I can't have students breaking in after hours, and playing with the system. There have been too many strange goings on around here lately. - Now where are we gonna go? - Leave it to me. - Yes, hello, as a concerned of this town, I have reason to suspect someone in the recent killings. Well, he does have a history of violence. He's from Chicago. Well, can't you look it up in your files? Lupenski, Eddie. Eddie Lupenski. No, I don't wish to leave my name. - Come on, I said I was sorry. I just thought-- - What did you think, you were gonna take me out here and screw my brains out. - Well shit. I mean, you and your friend, the way you're always strutting around. - You don't know shit about me, you skimpy little prick. Let me out of here. - Okay, okay, okay, I'll drive you home. - Good. What a buttface. - Did you hear that. - Hear what? - That noise. I'm gonna go check it out. - Yeah, bye. Just don't pee on your shoes. - Don't lock the door. Do you think I'm stupid or something. - Will you calm down, please? I said I'm sorry. What more do you want? - I wanna get outta here. - Okay, okay, I'll drive you home. - I don't feel like going home. Take me to Deirdra's. - Deirdra's? Fine, Deirdra's. - It's me. - You scared the hell outta me. What time is it anyway? Is it midnight already? - It's 12:30, I got tired of waiting. - My alarm must be screwed up again. Joel, would you mind waiting in the hall while I get dressed, please? - Sure, sure, sure. - Julie, is that you? - Mm-hmm. - Is everything all right? - Mm-hmm. - All right honey. I'll see you in the morning, goodnight. - Joel. - Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, just hurry up please. All right, come on. - Joel, are you sure this is a good idea? - No. - You are such an asshole. - Colleen, Colleen, come on. - Just get outta here. I don't wanna be seen near you, okay. - What an asshole. Deirdra. Deirdra. Deirdra. Deirdra. Somebody help. Help. Help. Somebody. - This is getting interesting. All the recent murders, the dates and locations follow the pattern of the attacker. And, there were always reports of wolves of wild dogs. And they were all on or around the full moon. - That's it. That's exactly what I heard when I was with Skip. - Let's get outta here. - Help, help, help me. - Colleen. - I got an idea. - Hurry Joel. - Go away. - Colleen. Joel hurry, please. Come on, light it. - I am. - Are you all right Colleen. - Oh, Julie. - It's really weird that the wolf just took off. I mean, I'm glad it did. But, according to my data-- - Joel, we've got to convince the police. - You're right. - What'd they say? - They didn't wanna hear it. - What'd you tell them. - I told them everything, and they treated my like some kid having a nightmare. They asked if you were involved in this. - What, why me? - Because of what you told them about the animal noises you heard when you were with Skip. They asked some strange questions about Eddie. They think he's involved with it somehow. - Eddie, do you think it's true? - Yeah well, all I know is we've seen a werewolf. And we have to stop it. - Do we really believe it's a werewolf? - Really, I mean, are we nuts. - Well, you both saw it. You tell me. - This is too weird. - Well, we need a silver bullet. - Where are we gonna get a silver bullet. - Well, my dad has some silver trophies packed away in the attic. I could have them melted down. I gotta go. Hey look, this isn't Michael J. Fox we're dealing with here. We're gonna need some help with this. - No shit Sherlock. - Well, so, we have to expose it. Then they'll believe us. - Well, good thinking, and how are we gonna do that? - I got a plan. Now, I gotta go. - Well, I better be getting home. - Well, thanks for helping me out last night. - Colleen, what were you doing out there all alone? - Learning my lesson, guys are jerks. - My exact words, then I met Joel. - Yeah, he really isn't such a creep. I mean, like, what other people say. - Come on, let's go. - Wait, I better warn Deirdra about Eddie Hall. - Or, is it the other way around? - Eddie, you're not going to go out tonight. - I'm going for a walk. I'm gonna start playing again this weekend. - I don't want to start an argument, but I really. - I'll be okay, I promise. I just gotta get out for a while, okay. - It's not safe out there. - You scared the hell outta me. - The legend of Lycanthropy? Why the books on werewolves Joe? - How did you know what lycanthropy means? - I'm not as dumb as you look. - So, why the books on werewolves? - Because I'm going some research. Do me a favor and don't tell anybody about this, okay. - Why would anybody care about your research? - Really, I gotta go. - Listen Colleen, this is what's happening. Joel's going down to the school to work on this some more, and I can't let him go do it alone. No, he doesn't know I'm coming. It's early, I'll be fine. But thanks for worrying.

It's nothing Joel. - That's not very funny. - It's probably just some animal. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Colleen, what are you doing here? You scared the hell outta me. - Well, you wouldn't let Joel come out here alone, so I'm not gonna let you. - Thanks. Deirdra, Deirdra, you brought her? - Well, she was over when you called. - Great, you may have just invited the enemy to our funeral. - Listen Julie, Deirdra's not that bad, really. You just gotta get to know her. Besides, I think she really does want to help. - Just what I suspected. I've been tracking the probable, and actual path of this thing, and it should be somewhere near here tonight. It'll just take a second more to print. Eddie. - You again. - Would you please hurry, it's over there. - What's over there? - I think that's it over there. - Come on Commitski. - Hey, knock it off. - Are you okay? - What happened? - I got scared, no big deal. - This is no place for you guys to be hanging out. I'm gonna take you down to the station. You can call somebody from there to come and get you. - Absolutely not. - No. - I left my car over there. - No way, I'm not going down there. - Shh. - Okay, who's in there? You better come out fella. - No, don't go any closer. - Eddie. It's okay, he's with us. - Ha ha, that's why you were so surprised to see him. Come on out here in the light fella. - Side door of the school has been broken into. Why, that's Eddie Lupenski. - You know this kid? - You bet, we got a tip on him, and Baker checked it out. - Come on, let's take a ride. - No wait, I mean, he didn't do anything. - All right, fine, then you can all come down to the station and do your explaining. I'll call for a back up car. - Sarge, how come you're leaving me alone out here? - What the hell was that? Commitski, check that out. - I hope that backup car gets here real soon. - Get in the car. - Shit. - Hey you. Hold it right there. - Dammit, I shoulda stayed on the grave yard shift. - Oh, Sarge, you better take a look at this. - Oh, isn't that where we saw the Lupenski kid? - Yeah, it was right around here. You okay Commitski? - Yeah, I just never saw one that bad Sarge. - Guys, I saw it. It looked right at me. It was horrible. - Come on kid, let's go call the coroner. - Yeah, I'm right behind ya. - I think we lost them. Thanks for backing me up. - You're welcome. - Now what are we gonna do. We're all suspects, and where's Joel? - I'm right here. Yeah, she's right. Breaking and entering the school, they're gonna be looking for us all over town. - And, where's the thing? - Well, I've got a good indication. All right, now, the creature has struck here, here, and here. See, now that it's in this neighborhood, it'll probably stay around. - Well, that puts my mind at ease. - Well, now I'm not absolutely positive, but theoretically, even with all the commotion, it shouldn't stray from the area. - Oh great, and we're out here in the woods with it? - Don't worry, I'm ready for a confrontation. - Where did you get that? - It's my dad's. - I found it in the attic when I was looking through some boxes. - You really believe this werewolf shit? - Yeah. - Where do we go from here. - We could go to my house. - Are you sure? - It's Friday night, my parents are never home on the weekends, or any other time for that matter. - What time is it? - I think it's about six thirty. - I wish I could tell my parents I'm okay. - Yeah, our families must be worried sick. - Yeah, right. - Yet another brutal murder has occurred in Fairview. Police have discovered the mutilated body of 53 year old Bill Randolph, a school custodian, during a break in at Fairview. At this minute, police are searching for five suspects who escaped police custody, after the break in. - Just perfect. - Holy shit, we were there. - The suspects are being sought for questioning in connection with Randolph's murder, as well as the disappearance of several other residents this past month. We are live at the Fairview Police Station with police Sergeant Patrickson. - The police department had put extra units on to comb the entire area. And we expect to have the five suspects picked up by the end of the day. That all I have for right now. - Hello, anyone home? - Shh, it's the cops. - Stay here please. - I knew it. They're gonna blame us. - For killing Mr. Randolph? - For everything. Wise up sweetheart, we're the prime suspects for all the murders. - That's ridiculous. How could they possible think we're the murderers. - Who was the last one to see Skip Harmon alive? - What are you trying to say? - No, what about you? Tell us about your police record. - What about your date with Richard, Deirdra, you know, the night he disappeared. - Wait just one minute here. I never even met Richard. I was just going out just to stand the dickhead up, all right, real mature, okay. But, I was pissed because of what he did to Eddie. I never meant for anything to happen to him. - Yeah right, Deirdra. We know the kind of chick you are. You'd sleep with anybody. - Oh, why don't you try it sometimes. You might enjoy it. - Look, I saw the way you look to us. - If you weren't so, screaming at the box-- - All right, wait a minute. Now, what's going on here? Now, if we can't trust each other, who can we trust? - He's right. It couldn't have been any of us. - You saw it too. - I saw something, I don't know what it was. It was following Deirdra. Now listen, let's just relax, and try an figure this thing out. - It was just so God damn close. It looked right at me. Oh God. - It's okay. It's gonna be all right. - I have a bad feeling about this. Julie, do you really think Joel knows what he's doing? - Yeah, are you sure this is a good idea? - I know some great hiding places inside the school. Believe me, they'll never look for us here. - Do you think it'll come out again tonight? - All my data indicated he's around here, yes. - This place will be crawling with cops tonight, Joel. - That's right, tonight's the winter costume ball. Come on, we're gonna get caught for sure. - I'm telling you, this is the last place they'll look for us. It's perfect. We'll just sit tight. - Joel, where will it attack next? - This is your committee chair person, Mrs. Lipshits. Welcome to Fairview's 17th annual winter costume ball. We'd like to thank you for coming out. In view of the recent events, we thought it best to carry on as normal, and have been reassured by the police that you are in no danger here. You will find the parking lots in this party to be heavily patrolled tonight. And we must insist that everyone stay in the gymnasium, and be escorted to their cars when leaving. This is for your protection. - Now, we're all here to enjoy ourselves with responsibility and restraint. And I assume you'll all behave yourselves properly. Excuse me. And, I trust that you will cooperate fully with any police officer that may have a question or two to ask you. They are here your protection. Thank you. I'm going to go check on the classrooms. - And don't forget out grand prize tonight, a five hundred dollar scholarship will be awarded to the best costume of the evening. Judges will be making preliminary choices during the evening, and the six runners up will be judged on stage at 10 P.M. So, stick around for the excitement. Gentlemen, you may begin to play. - Joel. - Shh, it's okay. It's just makeup. I got it from the theater department. Well, we gotta fit in. - And you like him? - Ten four, we got it covered. - Okay, listen, I checked the place out. There are cops everywhere. We're gonna have to split up. - Why? - Better off, less chance of catching up with all of us separated. - You're right. I'll take the south wing. - I'll go the other way. - See, I'm not moving. - Fine, you stay here, and you stay with her. I know a good hiding place. Now, don't forget, if you see it, don't forget to blow your whistle. - Don't worry, you'll hear it. - Good. All right, come on. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. - Joel, I'm really scared. - Me too. Come on, we'll be fine. - Okay, from here, we can check the south wing and the gym. - Joe, have you seen anything yet? - Gary, I haven't seen nothing. Hell, they had any smarts, they skipped town by now anyway. - Are you okay? - I guess this is all just getting to me. - All right, I'm gonna go check that out. I'll be right back. - Joel, please don't leave me. I don't wanna see anything happen to you. - Hey, I'll be okay. Okay, here. I want you to take this. - Joel, I can't possible, a gun. - You'll be okay. Just take it. - No. - All right, I'm gonna leave it right there, and I'll be right back. - All right everyone, the judges have selected the six runners up. Could you all come up on stage as I call your names, Patricia Lad, Mark O'Brien, Colleen Alexander, Jim. - Hey man, will you give us a break? - That was Deirdra. Julie? - Joel. - These are our six runners up. And the winner is, young man, you will leave the stage immediately. - Bitchin costume. - How dare you raise your hand to me. - Everybody, you go that way. - I'll cut him off down the hall. - Freeze. Stay right there. Freeze. - Josh, just stay back. - You can't harm it. You need a silver bullet, listen to me. - Hey Sargent, we have it cornered. What should we do? - The gun, where's the gun? - Go ahead, take it down. - No. You need silver bullets. It's a werewolf. You've got to listen to me. Where is the gun. - I got it. - It's him, that's the kid. - Take it easy now son. Give me the gun. - He's not gonna shoot you. Would you just let him through? - What are they doing? - Don't take another step. - He can kill it, please. - Eddie watch out. - What in the name of hell is it? - Sargent Patrickson, Sargent Patrickson, is it true that the alleged Fairview murderer has been killed in the school tonight? - Yes Ilene, we apprehended the criminal, Joseph Simmons, who was an instructor at Fairview. He was viscously attacking one of our officers after a confrontation. And other officers fired, killing the suspect. It is believed that he is responsible for a rash of grisly murders. - One question Sarge. - Excuse me, I have to thank these people right here. If I'd have listened to them sooner, maybe we would, in any case, they were very helpful in solving this crime. And I think the police department owes them an apology for suggesting that there was anything at all improper with their behavior. - One more question Sargent. - I'm sorry, Ilene, thank you very much. - Thank you, thank you. We are live at Fairview, where police have shot and killed the alleged Fairview murderer responsible for the recent string of brutal killings. At this moment, the only information we know is that the alleged killer is a Fairview computer instructor, a Mr. Joseph Simmons. We will come back on the air the second we get further information. For channel six news. - Hey guys, look, I know it's hard getting yourselves up to perform after last night. But, there's a lot of folks waiting to get into the club that dig your music.
