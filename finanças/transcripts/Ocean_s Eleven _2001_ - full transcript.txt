One con under escort. Open gate one. Man walking. Open gate two. Let's go. Face the wall. Got one under escort. - Good morning. - Morning. - State your name for the record. - Daniel Ocean. Thank you. The purpose of this hearing is to determine... ...whether you are likely to break the law again. This was your first conviction, but you've been implicated... ...in a dozen other schemes and frauds. What can you tell us about this? As you say, ma'am, I was never charged. We're trying to find out... ...if there was a reason for committing this crime... ...or just a reason you got caught this time. My wife left me. I was upset. I got into a self-destructive pattern. If released, is it likely you'd fall back into a similar pattern? She left me once. I doubt she'd do it again just for kicks. Mr. Ocean, what do you think you would do if released? - Chips, please. - Sure. - Change 150. Quarters or nickels? - Quarters are fine. - Good luck. - Thank you. 20. Dealer has 19. Good start. - I'm going on break now. - Here. Thank you very much. - Good luck. - You have a good one. - How are you, sir? - Hello, Frank. I beg your pardon. You must have me confused with someone else. My name is Ram?n. As you can see right here. - My mistake. - No problem, sir. The table's cold anyway. You might want to try the lounge at Caesars. Gets busy after 1:00. - 1:00? - Yes, sir. Thanks, Ram?n. Thank you. - Checking up on current events? - Ram?n? Glad to meet you. Frank Catton can't get past the gaming board. - You just got out? - This afternoon. You seen him? I heard he was teaching movie stars how to play cards. Why? You have a plan already? Are you kidding? I just became a citizen again. Officer Brooks... ...this is Danny Ocean. I was told to contact you within 24 hours. No, sir, I haven't been getting in trouble. No, sir, I haven't been drinking. No, sir, I wouldn't even think about leaving the state. Hey, Russ! Rusty. What's up, man? Let me ask you a question. Are you incorporated? You should think about it. I talked to my manager... - Bernie? - Not Bernie. My business manager. Actually, they're both named Bernie. He said what we do could be considered research... ...for a future gig, so I could make it a tax write-off. The one thing is, and this is his thing and it's stupid... ...but I'd have to pay you by check. Or we could just stick to cash. Yeah, let's just stick to cash. We'll begin with five-card draw. Everyone remember that? Who wants to start us out? Josh? Josh. To the left. Deal to your left. - Shane? - Hit me. - It's not blackjack. - Dude! Looking at them doesn't change them. You know what you have. - Left. Left. - Left, I'll get it. Lady bets. Let's keep it moving. - Blue. - Blue, that's a 50. - I'll call? - Okay. Shane's calling. 50. What the hell, it's only pocket change. That's your business. Pretend it's for a reason. Yeah, thanks, man. - Right. - How many? - Four. - You don't want four. You wanna fold. - I wanna fold? - Fold. Is that good? You're done. Let's take that. You're done. You're done. You have three pairs. You can't have six cards in a five-card game. - Maybe one was mine. - Wasn't me. Fellas! All reds. What up, dog? I'm gonna love spending your money. I'm gonna get my car washed. - How's the game going? - Longest hour of my life. - What? - I'm running away with your wife. Great. Isn't that hard, crossing over from television to film? Not for me, dude. Hey, Russ. We got another player... ...if that's cool with you. What do you do for a living? If you don't mind me asking. Why would I mind you asking? Two cards. I just got out of prison. - Really? - Why were you in prison? I stole things. You stole things? Like jewels? Incan matrimonial head masks. - Any money in Incan matrimonial...? - Head masks. Some. Don't let him fool you. There's loads if you can move them. I'll take one. But you can't. - My fence was confident. - You don't need a fence. - Some people lack vision. - Everybody in cellblock E. That's $500. - What's the first lesson in poker? - Never bet on the... - Leave emotion at the door. - Right, Topher. Today's lesson: How to draw out the bluff. That much money, this early... He has nothing better than a pair of face cards. Barry? All right. I fold. - Josh? - Don't worry, I'm game. I will see your $500 and I will raise you another... ...$500 of my own. - That's a very handsome bet. But don't push him too high, too fast. Keep him on the leash. - Holly? - Call. Call. And I'll call. I'll see your $500 and raise you $2000. Guys, you do what you like. That's a lot of money. I'm staying in. He's trying to buy his way out of his bluff. - Josh? - Two. Thattagirl. Call. - Call. - Call. Let's see them. I'm not sure what four nines does, but the ace, I think, is pretty high. Thanks for the tip on bluffing. Hey, Topher! How about an autograph? Come on, real quick. - God, I'm bored. - You look bored. How was the clink? You get the cookies I sent? Why do you think I came to see you first? - So tell me. - It's tricky. It's never been done before. It'll need planning and a large crew. - Guns? - Not quite. High security. The take... - The target? - Eight figures. What's the target? When was the last time you were in Vegas? You want to knock over a casino? The vault at the Bellagio. If I'm reading this right, and I'd like to think I am... ...this is probably the least accessible vault ever designed. You said three casinos? These feed into the Mirage and MGM Grand, but every dime ends up there. The Bellagio and the Mirage. - These are Terry Benedict's places. - Yes, they are. - Think he'll mind? - More than somewhat. You'd need at least 12 guys doing a combination of cons. Like what, you think? Off the top of my head, I'd say you're looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown... ...a Miss Daisy and a Leon Spinks. Not to mention the biggest Ella Fitzgerald ever. Where will you get the money to back this? Hit these three casinos, we'll get our bankroll. Benedict's got a list of enemies. But enemies with loose cash and nothing to lose? - Reuben. - Reuben. Hey. Oscar, lower it a bit, would you? Sorry. You guys done? Find what you want? We'll take these for the night to make copies. - Whatever you need. - Appreciate it. What? I need a reason. And don't say money. Why do this? Why not do it? I just left the joint after losing four years of my life... ...and you're cold-decking Teen Beat cover boys. Because the house always wins. Play long enough, the house takes you. Unless, when that perfect hand comes, you bet big. Then you take the house. - You practiced that speech? - Did I rush it? It was good. The Teen Beat thing was harsh. I wonder what Reuben will say. You're out of your damn minds! You're both of you nuts! I know more about casino security than any man. I invented it. And it cannot be beaten. They got cameras and watchers, they got locks. They got timers, vaults. They got enough armed personnel to occupy Paris! Okay, bad example. It's never been tried. It's been tried. A few guys even came close. You know the three most successful robberies in Vegas? Number three, the bronze medal. Pencil neck grabs a lockbox at the Horseshoe. Grab the guy in the suit! He got two steps closer to the door than anyone before. Leave the money! Second most successful robbery: The Flamingo in '71. This guy actually tasted fresh oxygen... ...before they grabbed him. Of course, he was breathing out of a hose for the next three weeks. Goddamn hippie. And the closest any man has come to robbing a Las Vegas casino... ...was outside of Caesars in '87. He came... ...he grabbed... ...they conquered. But what am I saying? You guys are pros. The best. I'm sure you can make it out of the casino. Of course, lest we forget... ...once you're out, you're still in the middle of the fucking desert! You're right. He's right. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. - That's what it is. Ego. - Yeah, blah, blah. - Thanks for lunch. - The nicoise was delicious. - Sorry to bother you. - Look, we go way back... ...and I owe you from the thing with the guy. - Our pleasure. - I'd never been to Belize. Give Dominic your addresses. I got some furniture to send you. Just out of curiosity, which casinos did you geniuses pick to rob? The Bellagio, the Mirage and the MGM Grand. Those are Terry Benedict's casinos. - Is that right? - That's right. You guys... ...what do you got against Terry Benedict? What do you have against him? That's the question. He torpedoed my casino. Muscled me out. Now he's gonna blow it up next month to make way for some monstrosity. - I see what you're doing. - What are we doing? If you're gonna steal from Terry Benedict, you better goddamn know. This used to be civilized. You'd hit a guy, he'd whack you. But Benedict... At the end of it, he'd better not know you're involved. Because he'll kill you, then he'll go to work on you. That's why we have to be very careful, very precise. Well-funded. You gotta be nuts, too. And you're gonna need a crew as nuts as you are. Who do you got in mind? - All right, who 's in? - Frank C. Is in. Frank has bronchitis and is applying for a transfer to warmer climates. Drivers? - I talked to the Malloys. - Mormon twins? They're in Utah, off the job. They're having trouble filling the hours. - Waiting, sweetheart. - Good. Go. - Waiting for you. - Why? - You're a little girl! - Relax. I'm going to get out and drop you like third-period French. Relax. - Electronics? - Livingston Dell. He's been doing surveillance work for the FBI mob squad. - How are his nerves? - Not so bad. Move in a little bit. - Don't touch that. - Why not? Do you see me grabbing your gun and waving it around? Hey, RadioShack. Relax. Munitions. - Phil Turrentine. - Dead. - No shit. On the job? - Skin cancer. - You send flowers? - Dated his wife for a while. Basher's in town. There may be an issue with availability. All right, chaps... ...hang on to your knickers. Oh, leave it out! You tossers! You had one job to do! That's all you used in the event? - You accusing me of booby-trapping? - Well? Booby traps aren't Mr. Tarr's style. Isn't that right? Basher? Peck. ATF. Let me venture a guess. Simple G-4 mainliner, back wound, quick fuse with a drag under 20 feet. Let me ask you this. You search this scumbag... ...for booby traps? I mean, really searched. Stand back. Here we go. - Find Griggs. I need him. - Who? Just find him, will you? Can you put something together with what I gave you? Done. - Is Danny about? - He's around the corner. Terrific. It'll be nice working with proper villains again. Everybody down! Get down! They weren't expecting that shit! - Nice work. - Thanks. - Which one's the Amazing Yen? - The little Chinese guy. - Who else is on the list? - He is the list. It doesn't seem that diff... - We got a grease man. - We got a grease man. We need Saul. - He got out of the game a year ago. - He get religion? Ulcers. - You could ask him. - Hey, I could ask him. I saw you at the paddock... ...before the second race, outside the men's room when I placed my bet. I saw you before you even got up this morning. - How you been, Saul? - Never better. What's with the orange? - My doctor says I need vitamins. - Why don't you take vitamins? You come here to give me a physical? Box seats. Come on. You gonna tell me? Or should I say no and get it over with? You're the best. You're in Cooperstown. What do you want? Nothing. I got a duplex now. I got wall-to-wall and a goldfish. I'm seeing a lady who works the counter at Macy's. I've changed. Guys like us don't change. We stay sharp or get sloppy. Quit conning me. That your hound way in the rear? He breaks late. Everyone knows this. You going to treat me like a grownup at least? Tell me what the scam is? Exhibit C: His belt as king of the heavyweight crown. Lennox Lewis has proven he's the champion. Saul makes 10. Ten should do it, don't you think? You think we need one more? You think we need one more. All right, we'll get one more. Hello, Linus. Whose is this? - Who are you? - A friend of Bobby Caldwell's. You're either in or out. Right now. - What is it? - It's a plane ticket. A job offer. - You're pretty trusting. - Bobby has faith in you. Fathers are like that. He didn't tell you? He doesn't want me trading on his name. Do this job, he'll be trading on yours. Don't, and you can go back to feeling up stockbrokers. Can you get the check, please? That's the best lift you've made yet. Las Vegas? America's playground. Did you guys get a group rate, or something? Saul, do you get out to Utah much? Not as often as I'd like. Check it out. I think you'd dig Provo. You could do well there. I'll look into it. Welcome to Las Vegas. Has everybody eaten? Good. Everybody sober? Close enough. Before we start, nobody's on the line yet. What I'm about to propose is highly lucrative and highly dangerous. If that's not your brand of vodka... ...eat as much as you like and have a safe journey. No hard feelings. Otherwise, come with me. You're Bobby Caldwell's kid? - From Chicago? - Yeah. - You like it there? - Yeah. That's wonderful. Get in the goddamn house. The 3000 block of Las Vegas Boulevard... ...also known as the Bellagio, Mirage and MGM Grand. They're three of the most profitable casinos in Las Vegas. This is the Bellagio vault, located... ...beneath 200 feet of solid earth. It safeguards every dime that passes through each of the three casinos. - We're gonna rob it. - Smash-and-grab job? Slightly more complicated than that. Well, yeah. This is courtesy of Frank Catton, a new dealer at the Bellagio. Bad news first. This place houses a security system rivaling most nuclear silos. First, we have to get in the casino cages, which takes more than a smile. Next, through these doors... ...each one requiring a different code changed every 12 hours. Past those, the elevator. Here's where it gets tricky. - It won't move without fingerprint I.D. - Which we can't fake. And vocal confirmation from the system within the Bellagio and the vault. Which we won't get. The elevator shaft is rigged with sensors. If we override the lift, the exit would lock and we'd be trapped. Once we get down the shaft, it's a piece of cake. Just two more guards with Uzis... ...and the most elaborate vault door ever conceived. Any questions? Tunneling's out. There are... ...sensors monitoring the ground. If a groundhog nested, they'd know. - Anyone else? - You mentioned good news? Yeah. The Nevada Gaming Commission requires... ...a casino to keep enough cash to cover every chip on the floor. That means on a weekday, by law, it must carry... ...between $60 and $ 70 million in cash and coin. On the weekend, between 80 and 90 million. On a fight night... ...in two weeks, the night we're robbing it... ...$ 150 million, without breaking a sweat. There are 11 of us, each with an equal share. You do the math. Exactly. I have a question. Say we get into the cage and through the security doors... ...down the elevator we can't move... ...past the guards with the guns, into the vault we can't open... - Without being seen by cameras. - Sorry, I forgot to mention that. Yeah, well, say we do all that... ...we're just supposed to walk out of there with $ 150 million... ...without getting stopped? Yeah. Oh. Okay. First task: Reconnaissance. I want to know what goes on... ... in all casinos, from the dealers ' rotation... ... to the path of cash carts. I want to know everything about every guard. Find out where they're from, nicknames, how they take their coffee. She dances at Crazy Horse Too, to pay for school. - I think she really likes me. - Cool. Know these casinos. They were built to keep people in. Know the quick routes out. - He went through at 10:44. - 10:46. Get a watch that works. - You make me sick, dude. It's 10:44. - 10:46. Second task: Power. Fight night, we throw the switch on Sin City. It's Basher's show. You want broke, blind or bedlam? - How about all three? - Right, it's done. Third task: Surveillance. Security has an eye and an ear on everything. We want an eye and ear on them. Livingston? Not the least accessible system I've seen, but close. - There's no closed-circuit I can tap? - No. Then it's definitely a black bag job. They employ an in-house technician? Two. And one of them is lonely. Thanks, Charmaine. I'll return it in an hour. - Say hi to your mom for me. - Say it yourself. She's on-stage soon. Watch it, bud! - You call me bud, pal? - You call me pal, friend? - You call me friend, jackass? - Don't call me jackass. 433, we have a visual impairment on the northwest 052 exit-door camera. Copy that. I see them. - Is that a word? You made that up? - "Obsequious" is a word. - Please move your balloons. - You got in my way! - I was trying to deliver my balloons! - Gentlemen! - He's a balloon boy! Balloon boy! - You're spitting in my face. And we're up and running. - Why are hallways always that color? - They say taupe is very soothing. - Hi. - Fine, thanks. - Move the balloons. - Move them? I have a client waiting for these. I don't have time to fool around with you circus animals. Hey! Hold up a minute! Excuse me! Hey! Excuse me! - Hey, you dropped this. - Oh, thank you. - How's the reception on those things? - Excellent. - Take care. - Thanks. - Well... - Yeah. Fourth task: Construction. We need to build an exact replica of the Bellagio vault. - To practice? - Something like that. Fifth task: Intelligence. We need those codes, Linus, from the guy who has all three. - Who, Benedict? - Learn to love his shadow. - All I get to do is watch the guy? - Gotta walk before you crawl. - Reverse that. - Sixth task: Transport. Well, I am sorry, but $ 18,500 a piece is the best offer that I can make. Well, I understand. - They are some great-looking vans. - Yes, sir, top of the line. - Okay. Thank you for your time, Mr...? - Denham. Billy Tim Denham. - Denham like a jean. - That's it. Just like the jean. Man, you got some lovely hands here. Do you moisturize? - I'm sorry? - I've tried lots of lotion. I even went fragrance-free for a year. Now my sister... ...she uses aloe vera with a little sunscreen in it. Ideally, we all should wear gloves to bed... ...but I found there was interference with my social agenda, you know. Plus, I react to the camphor. So I'm not into the traditional remedies. Let me tell you something. If you could pay cash... ...I could drop that down to seven... Sixteen each. - No? - Yes, sir. - You'd do that? - Yes, sir. That'd be lovely. They told me to see you. - Well, I'm glad they did. - They told me. Well, let me go get the paperwork. You just wait here at the table. - You do that. - Thank you. - Very nice material. - It's imported silk, Saul. It's very nice. Gentlemen, would you excuse us for a second? Saul, you sure you're ready to do this? If you ever ask me that question again, Daniel... ...you won't wake up the following morning. He's ready. My name is Lyman. Zerga. My name is Lyman Zerga. My name is Lyman Zerga. Okay, tell me about Benedict. That guy's a machine. Good afternoon. He arrives at the Bellagio every day at 2 p.m. How are you, Tommy? He remembers every valet's name. Not bad for a guy worth 3/4 of a billion. He works hard, hits the lobby floor at 7 on the nose. - Good evening, sir. - How are you? - Talks with his casino manager. - About what? All business. Benedict likes to know what's going on. Be in control. There's rarely an incident he doesn 't know about or handle personally. Spends a few minutes glad-handing the high rollers. He speaks Spanish, German and Italian and is getting good at Japanese. He's out by 7:30 and is handed a black portfolio. Contents: Profits and new security codes. He heads to the restaurant. Like I said, a machine. That portfolio contains codes to all the cage doors? And two minutes after they're changed, he's got them. You guys really can pick them. This guy's as smart as he is ruthless. Last guy he caught cheating, he not only sent up for 10 years... ...he seized his house and bankrupted his... In-law's dealership. He takes out your knees and ruins your life and anybody you know. You scared? You suicidal? Only in the morning. - Now what? - Now comes the girl. She comes down after him if they're in a snit. - Where does she come from? - The museum, there. She's the curator. Here she is. This is the best part of my day. I'm not sure we can use her yet. I haven't even caught her name. Tess. Huh? Her name is Tess. - We have to talk. Now. - Okay. Tell me this is not about her or I walk off the job. Who? Tess. Benedict. Tell me this isn't about... ...the guy who's screwing your wife. - Ex-wife. - Tell me. - It's not about that. It's not entirely about that. Remember when we got in this business? We said we'd play like we had nothing to lose. Well, I lost something. I lost someone. That's why I'm here. The problem is, now we're stealing two things. And if you can't have both, which do you choose? Remember, Tess does not split 11 ways. If everything goes to plan, I won't be the one that has to make that choice. - How did she look? - She looked good. Thanks. You like it? I like that you like it. - I'll see you tonight? - Okay. In my hotel, there's always somebody watching. I'll see you tonight. Weak stomach, Mr. Zerga? I don't believe in weakness. It costs too much. I don't believe in questions either. Oh, really? Well then, let me give you a tip. Don't get into Terry Benedict for too much money. He doesn't fool around. - How are you, Eddie? - Fine, sir. Anything for me? Mr. Lyman Zerga. Third position. Wants to talk to you privately. Who is he? Businessman of some kind, from Europe. Very vague. I asked around. Word is, he deals primarily in arms. - One of the biggest. - Zerga. Yes, sir. - Never heard of him. - That's why I don't doubt it. - He's staying here? - He's in the Mirador suite. - How's he doing? - Up, almost 200. Good for him. You're 30 seconds late. I was about to send out a search... Hello, Tess. What are you doing here? I'm out. - Out? - Of prison. Remember? I went for cigarettes and didn't come back. I don't smoke. Don't sit. - They say I paid my debt to society. - Funny, I never got a check. You're not wearing your ring. I don't have a husband, or didn't you get the papers? - My last day inside. - I told you I'd write. - Danny, go now before... - What? Benedict? How you doing? Whiskey and whiskey. You're doing a great job at the museum. The Vermeer is quite good. - Vibrant. But his work fell off later. - Remind you of anyone? I always confuse Monet and Manet. Which one married his mistress? - Monet. - And Manet had syphilis. They also painted occasionally. All right, I'll make this quick. I came here for you. I want to get on with my life. I want you with me. You're a thief and a liar. I lied about being a thief. I don't do that now. - Steal? - Lie. Terry doesn't have to make the distinction. He's clear on both. - You have a problem. - Only one? You've met too many people like you. I'm with Terry now. Does he make you laugh? He doesn't make me cry. - The fight is Saturday night? - Yes, would you like tickets? No. Hand-to-hand combat does not interest me. I have a package arriving here that evening. A black briefcase, standard size... ...the contents of which is very valuable to me. I'll put it in the house safe. The house safe is for brandy and grandmother's pearls. - I need something more secure. - Mr. Zerga, I can assure you our... I can assure you, Mr. Benedict, that your generosity in this matter... ...will not go overlooked. Now, what can you offer me besides the safe? People you steal from have insurance. They get made whole again. I had to leave New York to escape. How do I get my five years back? - What you can do is not throw... - You don't know anything. You don't love me, you want someone else. - I must live with that. But not him. - Spoken like a true ex-husband. - I'm not joking. - I'm not laughing. There's a conflict of interest when you give me love advice. Yes, but that doesn't mean I'm wrong. Do you remember what I said when we first met? - That I better know what I'm doing. - Do you? Now? You should go if you don't. - I know what I'm doing. - What are you doing? Just catching up. - Meet my ex-husband. - Danny Ocean. - Mr. Ocean. - I'm in your seat. Forgive my lateness. A guest required my attention. That's fine. Danny was walking through and spotted me. - Is that so? - Imagine the odds. Of all the gin joints in all the world. You recently were released from prison? That's right. - How does it feel to be out? - About the same. - Danny was just about to... - I just stopped by to say hi to Tess. Stay, have a drink. - I can't. - He can't. Well, then... I imagine we won't see Mr. Ocean anytime soon. You never know. I know everything happening in my hotels. So I should put those towels back. No, the towels you can keep. - Good to see you, Tess. - Take care, Danny. - Terry. - Danny. Stinking... Tomorrow the day is yours. Call is at 5:30, makeup and costume. Saul's package arrives at 7:05. Linus grabs our codes. All goes well, we're a go. At 7:30, Yen is locked in and we're committed. From this point, we have 30 minutes to blow the power or he suffocates. Once the electricity goes, access to the vault... ... and its elevator shut down for two minutes. That's when we go. You're in the middle of the room, 10 feet from everything. You have to get to the door without touching the floor. What do you do? - Ten says he shorts it. - Twenty. Window or aisle, boys? Yeah, we're in deep shit. That poxy demo crew didn't back the main line. They naused up the mainframe. Naused it up! - You understand him? - I'll explain later. They're so pony they blew the backup grids one by one. Basher, what happened? They did what I would have done but by accident. Now they know their weakness, they're fixing it. So unless we intend to do this job in Reno, we're in Barney. Barney Rubble. Trouble! - We could always... - By tomorrow? Hang on a minute, hang on. We could use a pinch. What's a pinch? A device which creates a cardiac arrest for broadband circuitry. Better yet, a pinch is a bomb without the bomb. When a nuclear weapon detonates, its electromagnetic pulse... ...shuts down any power source within its blast radius. It usually doesn't matter because a nuclear weapon destroys everything. A pinch creates a similar electromagnetic pulse... ...without mass destruction and death. Instead of Hiroshima you get... ...the 17th century. - How long? 30 seconds. Could a pinch knock out the power of an entire city? - Like, for instance... - Las Vegas? Yeah, I think it might.
