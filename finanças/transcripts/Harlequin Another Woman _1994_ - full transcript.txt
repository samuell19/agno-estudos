[ethereal music] [breathing machine whirring] MAN [IN HEAD]: I don't see anypoint in prolonging the misery. WOMAN [IN HEAD]: It hurts me to watch you destroy your family again. [breathing machine whirring] MAN [IN HEAD]: I can solve this problem. WOMAN [IN HEAD]: It doesn'tmean anything to me anymore. [breathing machine whirring] WOMAN [IN HEAD]: Oh, yeah,like it matters to you. MAN [IN HEAD]: I would never do anything to physically harm Lisa. [breathing machine whirring] WOMAN [IN HEAD]: Beauty comesfrom the inside, Bonnie. MAN [IN HEAD]: Trust me. [breathing machine whirring] WOMAN [IN HEAD]: It hurts me to watch you destroy your family again. WOMAN [IN HEAD]: I don't have anywhere to go. There is nobody that I can count on. MAN [IN HEAD]: I don't see anypoint in prolonging the misery. MAN [IN HEAD]: You've got me. And you know I'll do anything for you. Anything. WOMAN [IN HEAD]: Oh, yeah,like it matters to you. Everything's gotten so crazy, I don't know what I want anymore. Let me help you. [breathing machine whirring] MAN [IN HEAD]: I don't see anypoint in prolonging the misery. MAN [IN HEAD]: Let me help you. WOMAN [IN HEAD]: I just want him out of my life. MAN [IN HEAD]: There's so much a guy can take. MAN [IN HEAD]: You will be. WOMAN [IN HEAD]: Beauty comesfrom the inside, Bonnie. MAN [IN HEAD]: Trust me. WOMAN [IN HEAD]: I just want him out of my life. MAN [IN HEAD]: Trust me. WOMAN [IN HEAD]:[SHOUTING] It's your fault! MAN [IN HEAD]: Trust me. WOMAN [IN HEAD]: [SHOUTING] Get out! Get out! [breathing machine whirring] [shoes clacking] MAN [IN HEAD]: Let me help you. WOMAN [IN HEAD]: This is just some new way she's dreamed up to torture us. [OVERLAPPING SOUNDS OFSHOES CLACKING AND BREATHING MACHINE WHIRRING] WOMAN [IN HEAD]:[SHOUTING] It's your fault! Go away! Get out! [beeping] Looks like 1007 is coming around. Don't try to move. Relax. It doesn't look as bad as it feels. [somber music] You got a really good bump on your head there. Where am I? Your name is Lisa Temple. Somebody attacked you last night. Do you remember what happened? Lie still. I'll get the doctor. [door creaking open] [shoes clacking] [door shutting] [somber music] Now, Lisa, I want you to tellme the names of some things, all right? OK. What's this? Watch. Hand. Um, your fingers. Blanket. Doris. [laughing] There's nothing wrong with your motor skills, your hearing, your sight. Bit of a headache, right? Mhm. Well, that'll go in a couple of days. But I don't know who I am. Lisa, do you know who I am? LISA TEMPLE: No. Do you have any memory of,uh, meeting me before today? Mm-mm. You don't remember coming tomy office, or what it was we talked about? Was I hurt before? Are you my doctor? I'm your psychiatrist. I'm Dr. Holcross. Lisa, there's someone elsethat I would like you to meet. Lisa, this is your husband, Paul. My husband. I should know him better than anybody, right? DR HOLCROSS: It's all right. Come on, what is happening to me? The CAT scans and theMRI show no brain damage. However, your wife has nomemory of anything that happened to her prior to this morning. This is ridiculous. She must be faking. No, amnesia ispractically an impossible condition to simulate, Paul. I wouldn't stop Lisa from trying. Look, she's carrying on conversations. How can she do that if she has no memory? Your wife has what'scalled retrograde amnesia. She's like someone from another planet who's only read about life on Earth. For example, they'd understandthe concept of snow, but not know what it feels like, or what it sounds like to stand on. No personal experience. Mhm. I mean, she is like a child. She's experiencing everythingfor the first time. I still think she's faking. Why? I was going to serve divorcepapers on her this morning. You're telling us that she got someone to give her a severe head injury to postpone a divorce proceeding? I wouldn't put it past her. Be reasonable. She could have died from that blow. Chris, could you, uh, excuse us for a moment? I'm sorry, Ken. Look, she doesn't want to haveanything to do with me anymore, and I don't see any pointin prolonging the misery. Well, if she's unhappy in the marriage, why is she opposed to leaving it? This isn't about marriage. It's about teaching me a lesson. Now, the circumstances thatbrought her into therapy, Paul, they're not your fault. I know that. But she need somebody to blame, and I'm it. Now, that is unworthy of you. - Unworthy? - Yes. I think you're more compassionate than that. Well, maybe I used to be, but there's only so much a guy can take. [sighing] All right, all right. Seek a second opinion, if you want. I'm telling you, she'swoken up in a strange world. And she's going to need you. Ah, hardly a mark. You're healing very nicely. Any more headaches? No. Good. Couple more days, and you'll be going home. I don't want to go home. Why? Your husband's gorgeous. He doesn't like me very much. I can tell. Good morning, Lisa. Doris. - Good morning. Dr. Barnes tells me you're feeling a lot better this morning.- Yes. Oh, good. Good. Uh, this is Detective Washburnfrom the police department. Do you feel likeanswering a few questions? Sure. I don't know how much of ahelp I can be, Detective. I think your doctor was hopingI might help jog your memory. How about if I give you the official version. OK. Call me Janet. All right. Thanks, Janet. Uh, it looks like an open and shut robbery. You own a very nicerestaurant called McCat, and-- I own a restaurant. Yes. Your bartender says he usuallyescorts you to your car, but that night you were upset about something, and left alone. What was I upset about? He didn't know. He just said you spent all nightin conversation with a man. My husband. No, a big man with a mustache. I don't remember. Your bartender you saidyou'd had a couple of drinks. I don't drink. I don't know why I said that. It just came out. It sometimes happens that way. Don't be frightened. Do you remember this man's name? No. I'm sorry, I just, um-- I don't know what is,uh, real, and what's not. Maybe we should continue this later, hm? Paul is waiting to see you. I just think I'll tell himthat, uh, you need some rest. [shoes clacking] [somber music] The recovery process canbe unsettling, especially if the memory is unpleasant. And this man is somebody she dislikes? No, no, more likely she associates him with some sort of conflict. Do you mind if I talk to her husband? Mm. This way. I don't know who she could have been with. Does your wife have many male friends that you don't know about? I think so, yes. And that's all right with you? Not exactly. So that's why you filed for divorce. The papers were registeredthe day of the attack. Were you feeling angry and hurt? What exactly are you getting at, Detective? Maybe you wanted to hurt her. Now, just a minute. I would never do anythingto physically harm Lisa. Well, muggers don'tusually do the kind of number that was done on Mrs. Temple. Besides her purse, her staff told us the thief took her engagement ring. So? The insurance company says it's worth $40,000. Some guys figure a ring likethat isn't the ex-wife's to keep. I'll be in touch. [suspenseful music] DORIS: Hello, Mrs. Temple. Hi. Well, do we remember how to use one of these? I think so. Right-handed. Dr. Barnes says the body just knows some things, and it teaches the mind. So, do you like tuna casserole? I don't know. [giggling] OK. Mhm. DORIS: OK. So we like tuna casserole. All right, let's see how we feel about turnips. That? No. You don't like turnips. Live and learn. Try the peas. LISA TEMPLE: OK. Mm. We're making progress. [giggling] [suspenseful music] [car beeping] [suspenseful music] [car honking in distance] [suspenseful music] [car honking in distance] [suspenseful music] [whistling] [suspenseful music] [shoes clacking] Can I help you, sir? Lisa Temple? Are you family? Just a friend. Well, I'm afraid her visitsare restricted right now. Would you like to leave message? That's OK. Would you see that she gets these? Thanks. Sir, there's no card. She'll know who they're from. [birds chirping] [gentle music] Good morning. ANNA: Morning, Bonnie. PAUL TEMPLE: Hi, Bon. Hey. What are you doing here? You're usually gone by now. Dr. Holcross wants me to pick up Lisa today. Why? Can't they keep her any longer? Bonnie. BONNIE TEMPLE: I'm sorry,but it's just been so nice around here with her gone. Well, maybe the hospitalwants to get rid of her before she starts terrorizing the nurses. You shouldn't joke like that, Mr. Temple. Mrs. Temple could have been killed. You're right, Anna. I'm sorry. So does Lisa really not remember who she is? Apparently not. So Dr. Holcross thinks that getting her into familiarsurroundings will help her get back to her old self again. - Hm. Now that's something to look forward to. I heard that. Well, it's true. I mean, she used to be really cool. And then she just went strange. She's still part of the family, Bonnie. So until she starts feeling better, we've just all got to do the best we can. And we're all to try not to upset her. OK. OK. But if you ask me, this is just some new way she's dreamed up to torture us. Finish your breakfast. You're gonna miss your school bus. So I've been married to Paul for six years, but I don't remember him. Well, I'm sure it feels unusual, but, uh, we'll soon have you back to normal. How do we do that? DR HOLCROSS: Oh, just by talking. And as you re-experience yourold life and your surroundings, what you've forgotten will return. [knocking on door] Excuse me. Perfect timing. Come in. Lisa, Paul's come to take you home. How are you feeling? My head hurts a little. Well, when you get beatenup, that's how it feels. I was hoping to do somethingabout my hair before I saw you. Excuse me. Still think she's faking, do you? Oh she's good. I'll give her that. Paul, this is her chance to come back. I mean, the memory of whathappened to the two of you, it's gone for the moment. And there's a chance it may never come back. She's very vulnerable right now,so don't be confrontational. Treat her gently. But no intimate contact. Ken, I haven't touched her in over a year. She can't even stand being near me. Sometimes, I wish the feeling were mutual. [sighing] Hi. Hi. Wow, you look wonderful. I wish I could dosomething about this dress. Your husband says it's one of your favorites. Maybe he doesn't know who I am, either. Honey, I know the thoughtof leaving here is scary, but it's the only way you're going to find out who you really are. [somber music] The car's just over here. Paul, no one's come to visit me besides you. Doesn't surprise me. Other patients were beingvisited by their mothers and fathers, their children. You don't have any children, Lisa. What about my mother and father? They died when you were a child. [car honking in distance] [suspenseful music] Paul, have I done something to upset you? Uh, put your seat belt on. [suspenseful music] [phone ringing] Yes? Hi, Rosemary. What's up? Uh-huh. No. No, I don't want those planesgoing out unless they're clean. Well, if Tom needs to hirean extra guy, hire one. Yeah. OK, I'll be in after lunch. Right. Bye-bye. [laughing] Bye-bye. So you work with planes. I, uh, I own a charter company. Um, you seem to like Rosemary. I mean, you talk nicely to her. [suspenseful music] [birds chirping] [gentle music] [suspenseful music] This is where we live? It's beautiful. [birds chirping] Hello. Welcome home, Mrs. Temple. This is Anna, our housekeeper. Oh. Anna. And this is? If you ask me, she hasn't changed at all. This is my sister, Bonnie. Oh. Sorry, Bonnie. I should have rememberedsomeone as pretty as you. Oh, right. Right. Beauty comes from the inside, Bonnie. But in your case, it hastrouble getting to the surface. [ethereal music] Is that supposed to be me? Excuse me. Bonnie. Come in. [shoes clacking] [ethereal music] [phone ringing] Excuse me. [phone ringing] [ethereal music] Hello? Hi, Jerry. [ethereal music] No, no, I haven't changed my mind. I've just been a little busy, that's all. [ethereal music] Sure, run down the list for me. [ethereal music] Yeah. [ethereal music] Where am I gonna go? [ethereal music] PAUL TEMPLE: Yeah. [ethereal music] No, that's not a problem. [ethereal music] [door slamming] [inaudible] [ethereal music] No. OK. [knocking on door] Yes. Oh, Jerry, I'm gonna have to get back to you. Yeah. OK. Do you need some help getting upstairs? Um, I just don't know which bedroom is ours. We don't share a bedroom, Lisa. Oh. I see. Paul, will you please showme where I'm supposed to go? Of course. [somber music] Come on. [somber music] It's up the stairs, down at the end of the hall. [somber music] Do you want me to take you? [somber music] Come on. [somber music] It's so beautiful. Look, I have to get going. If you need anything, just ask Anna. [somber music] Most people knock, you know. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just getting to know where everything is. Oh, what a cute little dog. Is that yours? Hi. Yes. Can't you see the resemblance? You told me people chose dogs who look like them. I must've been joking. Yeah, I wish. Come here. [somber music] Paul keeps that room locked. [somber music] [suspenseful music] [door shutting] [gentle music] - Is something wrong? - That dress. Anna said that Iusually dress for dinner. Yes, you do. I've-- I've just never seenyou wear that dress before. Is it all right? It's lovely. Uh, let me guess, you can't remember where the dining room is, either. Are you gonna show me? [gentle music] Thanks. [gentle music] There. We have vichyssoise, thenroast of lamb with vegetables. Turnips? No Good. Where's Bonnie? She ate earlier. She wanted to watch something on TV. Anna, this is great. Looks like you've gone to a lot of trouble. Thank you. It's a cold leek and potato soup. You like it. I do? PAUL TEMPLE: Mhm. I do. So, um, Paul, tell me about Bonnie. She came to live withus after my parents died. I think I've been mean toher, and I don't know why. Eat your vichyssoise before it gets cold. It is cold. That was a joke. I hope you don't think that was a good one. No, I don't. OK. [crickets chirping] [water spraying] [gasping] Oh! [laughing] Oh. Oh, wow. [suspenseful music] Whew! [suspenseful music] [birds chirping] [gentle music] Morning, Bonnie. I saw you from the window, andI thought I might join you. Good morning. How are you today, Grover? [dog panting] Is that his name? Amazing. She remembers the dog's name,but she doesn't remember mine. Bonnie, I can't help what I remember. People used to say youcouldn't help what you said. Bonnie, I really didn't mean to say that you look like a dog. Well, it's better than someof the things you've said to me. I mean, at least I standa chance with another dog. You're a beautiful girl, Bonnie. Why would you ever believethat you're unattractive? Let's face it, I'm no cover girl. Neither are they whenthey wake up in the morning. Beauty comes from the inside, Bonnie. When you believe in who you are,then it just shines through. That sounds familiar. It's because you used tosay it to me all the time. Well, I mean, before you changed. Changed? What happened? Bonnie, please, I need to know. Maybe you'd better ask Paul. I have to go to school. Come on, Grover. [dog barking] Good morning. It smells good. Is there any coffee? Of course. I'll bring it to you. Oh, that's OK. I'll get it. It's good to see you up so early. You don't normally surface until lunchtime. Well, not anymore I don't. It's really beautifulout there in the morning. Mhm. Anna, did Paul and I alwayshave separate bedrooms? I only know that one night you moved all his things into the guest room. You'd been growing apart for some time. Morning. Oh, you're up early. How are you feeling? A little shaky. Paul, Bonnie said that somethinghad happened that changed me. I think that's something you should discuss with Dr. Holcross. Actually, I-- I just have a few thingsto drop at the airport, and then I'll drive you in, OK? Great. [gentle music] - Morning, Tag. - Morning. Paul, how did we meet? In a bar. But I don't drink. You were serving the drinks. The next day, I came back totalk to you, and you were gone. I thought I'd lost you. Then a while later, I was having lunch in this little cafe downtown,and a voice said, hello, again. And it was you. And you remembered me. Anyway, that was your first restaurant. It's not as grand as the one you've got now, but that's how we met. Well, that sounds like a fairytale, like maybe we weredestined for one another. Yeah, I used to think so. Thanks. You're welcome. ROSEMARY: Eagle Charters Limited, may I help you? Hold on, I think he just walked in. Morning, Rosemary. Paul, I have your lawyer on line one. Oh, hello, Mrs. Temple. Hello. Do you remember Rosemary? Hello, Rosemary. I'll take it in my office. Oh, did Tom hire that new maintenance man? Yeah. He starts this afternoon. Good. Just be a minute. He'll be right withyou, if you just hold on. Uh, may I get you a coffee, Mrs. Temple? [phone ringing] No, I'm fine. Please don't go to any trouble. [phone ringing] Eagle Charters Limited. Yes, sir, we do. I'll have that arranged for you. [gentle music] Jerry, just hold off onthe divorce for a few days. I can't turn her out now. JERRY [ON PHONE]: Fine. But if we don't move first, she could make it a lot more expensive. I understand that, Gerry,and I appreciate the advice, but I just can't do it right now. Look, I'll talk to you later, all right? [gentle music] Hi. Hi. I remember this car. You were driving it on our first date. We went to dinner, and then a play. "Strindberg," because youwere trying to impress me. Yes. And I was impressed. [gentle music] And then we drove to the beach. I remember. So take me for another ride in this little car. [gentle music] It's not far to the beach, is it? No. No, its not. [gentle music] [seagull squawking] [waves lapping] [gentle music] It's just like I remember it. Except for the moonlight. We used to come here for hours. You'd tell me about your life,I would tell you about mine. And we'd stay until the sun came up. Well, that's how long it took me to work up the nerve to kiss you. It was worth the wait. We used to come here a lot, huh? Back then, spending 10minutes apart was about all we could stand. [seagull squawking] [waves lapping]We should be getting back. I've got work to do. Can't we stay, Paul? I need you to tell me about my life. No, Lisa, we really should be getting back. We always went in the water before we left. Well, we don't have any towels. We didn't then, either. Come on. Please, Paul? Please? Please? Please? All right, but just for a minute. You're gonna be fine. [gentle music] Paul? PAUL TEMPLE: Yeah. You could have had anygirl, but you married me. Why? You were everything I ever wanted. Am I still? WOMAN [OVER INTERCOM]: Mr. Temple, you're wanted in your office. Mr. Temple. Paul, what happened with us? We were so much in love. What changed? WOMAN [OVER INTERCOM]: Mr. Temple, please call your office. I-- [gentle music] I stopped by your home. Your housekeeper said you andMrs. Temple would be here. Have a seat. How is she doing? Better, I think. Little things are startingto come back to her. Does she remember the attack yet? No. What do you need, Detective? We're still trying to findthe man she was with that night. What's today's theory? He's the mugger, or he's the manI hired to teach her a lesson? Any chance he was a boyfriend? I don't know. And right now, neither does she. Well, we're tracing herring and her credit cards, but until something happens,that guy's all I've really got. He may have seen something. Wouldn't he have come forward by now? Maybe nobody was supposedto know he was there. Do you mind if I speak to her again? Yes. And why is that? [somber music] Check with her doctor first. There are some things it might be better if she didn't remember. [suspenseful music] [car starting] LISA TEMPLE: We're notgetting anywhere, are we? Oh, you're remembering a little more each day. But it's from so long ago, youknow, it's, uh, our first date, our wedding. Nothing about my life right now. Well unfortunately, that's the way it works. It's called [inaudible] theorem. Memories tend to return in chronological order. Well, can't we make it go any faster? No. I think that would do more harm than good. Why don't you just tell me what you know? Now, Lisa, your experiencesdetermine your personality. It's not up to me to tell you who you are. I just get the feeling thateverybody used to like me, and then something made me bitter and twisted. And that's not me. I don't want to be like that again. Well, why don't wetalk about that tomorrow? I know I've said it before, butthings will get back to normal. You'll see. How are we doing? Just fine. Can I talk to you for a minute, Ken? - Of course. - Won't be long. All right. You know I can't discussLisa's therapy, Paul. But she's a different person. This is the woman who I fell in love with. I know. She's had to create this hard shell around her in order to deflect the pain of what happened. And when she remembers? I don't know. Ken, I don't know how muchlonger I can keep this up. You have to. She's got to know that you're there for her. I just-- I just don't want to lose her all over again. I'm sure. But you have to be preparedfor that possibility. ROSEMARY: There you go, Mr. Brown. Welcome to the Eagle Charters team. Thanks. If you go downstairs to maintenance, Tom will show you around. Sure thing. Is, uh, Mr. Temple around? Uh, not today, I'm afraid. Oh, that's too bad. [phone ringing] Guys down at the union hallsay he's a real good man. Can't wait to meet him. [suspenseful music] [gentle music] Hey, Bonnie. BONNIE TEMPLE: Hey, Jody. We're gonna go get some ice cream. Would you like to come? Um, I can't. I've got homework to do. Come on, Jody, let's go. OK. Well, that's too bad. But, uh, maybe another time. Yeah, maybe. All right, cool. See you later. [pop music playing] [somber music] Bonnie, are you OK? What's wrong? Yeah, like it matters to you. It matters. What happened? Why should I tell you? Just so you can throw itback in my face the next time you get mad at me? Bonnie, who hurt you? Nobody. No one. I just-- just like always, I hurt myself. Please let me help. Please. All right. There's this guy in my class, Jody. And he doesn't even know that I exist. And then today, he asked me for ice cream. And there was this girl in the truck that was prettier than me, andI thought, what's the point? I mean, I'll just look like the ugly friend that they dragged along. I mean, I look plain enough on my own, but put me up against someone like her, and I come off a total loser. Well, that's not true. Yes, it is. Dr. Holcross says that, um, when people are scared of being hurt, they find ways to protect themselves. Maybe you're avoiding Jodyso that you won't get hurt. Why do you think he noticedyou in the first place? Well, I-- I tried what you said about being happy about who I am, and-- I don't know, maybe he saw that. Maybe next time he asks you for ice cream, you could say yes. Let him get to know you. Hey, I'll help you out. I'll teach you things. You know, we could do it together. Poor Jody, he's not gonna know what hit him. [dog barking] You should go see your buddy out there. I think he really missed you today. Thanks, Lisa. I'm gonna go upstairs andlook at some photos I found. Maybe you can help me out andtell me who's in the pictures. Oh, do you know where Ican get a key to that room? Paul has the only key. [dramatic music] [footsteps receding] [suspenseful music] [horn sounding] [suspenseful music] [phone ringing] Thanks. [indistinct chatter] Hi, Rosemary. Hi. Accounting finally deliveredthat cost report you asked for. Oh, good. ROSEMARY: Are you gonna stay late tonight? No, I'm just gonna returna couple of phone calls, and then I'm heading home. Seems to me you've been leaving a lot earlier these days. [phone ringing] [gentle music] [ominous music] Hey. Hey, hey, hey. You got me. And you know I'll do anything you want. LISA TEMPLE [IN HEAD]: It doesn't mean anything to me anymore. MAN [IN HEAD]: Let me help you. Trust me. [ominous music] MAN: Uh, i think there'sgonna be about six of us. [indistinct chatter] [ominous music] [car starting] [ominous music] [honking] Hey! [tires screeching] [glass shattering] WOMAN: You almost ran over me! MAN: Hey, buddy. Buddy, are you all right in there? Mister! Somebody give me a hand here, will you? [dog barking in distance] [somber music] BONNIE TEMPLE: Paul. [laughing] What's going on? Anna told me you got in a car accident. I just got so scared. I mean, it reminded me of everything that-- I'm OK. I'm OK. All right? Where's Lisa? She's in the study. [sighing] All right. I don't want to upset her, OK? OK. Off to bed. All right. Goodnight. Goodnight. Hi. Hi. What are you doing? Well, I remembered our honeymoon. I started going through these photos, and-- and just it all came back to me. 10 countries in 10 weeks. We went to London and Paris, Geneva. Paul, we had so much fun. No man ever loved a womanas much as I loved you. [gentle music] Paul, who are the men in this photo? How come you're not with us? [somber music] They must be friends of yours, Lisa. People who, uh, went to your restaurant. For the last while, you'veled a separate life. [somber music] I don't want to beseparate from you anymore. [ethereal music] What's wrong? It's late. You should get your rest. Goodnight. [footsteps receding] [somber music] [siren wailing in distance] [suspenseful music] Don't worry, darling. If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. [suspenseful music] REPORTER [ON TV]: Cloudinesstomorrow, sticky and humid, with a high of 96. With the winds out of the eastat 14 MPH, it's currently-- [birds chirping] [gentle music] LISA TEMPLE: Good morning. Good morning. Morning. Anna, are you all right? She has one of her migraines. I took my pills. I'll be all right in an hour or so. Oh, nonsense. You go. Go back to bed. Leave this to us. Mrs. Temple, you don't cook. I own a restaurant. I must have picked up something along the way. Go on now, we're gonna be fine. OK. So what are we making? You're making a souffle. A souffle, huh? Is there a cookbook around here? Morning. Hi. Take a seat. I got your breakfast. [WHISPERING] Breakfast? Mhm. Wow. I knew I could do it. [clearing throat] [stifled laughter] [giggling] I could make toast. [laughter] It's not that I don't enjoy your cooking, but what do you say we goout for dinner tonight, just the two of us? One of those nice little places we used to go? Uh, all right. As long as Anna's feeling better. You know, I don't want to leave her alone. OK. [phone ringing] Do you want me to get that? Oh, if it's important,they'll get me at the office. PAUL TEMPLE [ON ANSWERING MACHINE]: Hi, this is Paul Temple. Please leave a message after the beep, and I'll get right back to you. [machine beeping] JERRY [ON ANSWERINGMACHINE]: Paul, it's Jerry. About the divorce, if you delay much longer it'll complicate things. I better make a move, or Lisa could create real problems for you. Call me, OK? [somber music] You're divorcing me? Let me explain. [sighing] [somber music] You know when I told you how we met, you said it was like a fairytale. And it was. But we didn't live happily ever after. You stopped loving me. No. I always, uh-- I always felt that you gave up on me. You couldn't stand beingin the same room with me, you couldn't wait to get out of the house. And you stayed away for hours. Where did I go? Your restaurant. Work was the only thing that mattered to you. Why? Look, uh, things are different now. We can start fresh. Paul, I need to know. OK. [somber music] Paul. [somber music] [door shutting] I see people going about their day, hardly thinking about yesterday. But our memories are who we are. Memories don't create reality,Lisa, but they do reflect it. I don't like what I see reflected. Everybody's scared of me. What do you think they're afraid of? That if they get close to me, that if they tell me the truth about whoI am, that I'll hurt them. And will you? Of course not. Then tell them that. See, most of life's problems, Lisa, don't come from what happens to us, but rather how we react to those events. Mhm. And some people rise above their problems, and other people are destroyed by them. Yes. And some people take outtheir hurt and their anger on those they love the most. Ken, I need to know what happened to me. The thing you need to understand the most is that your family loves you,that they're there for you, and they need to know that you love them. [gentle music] [crickets chirping] Here, like this. Have it back like that, and Jody could get a good look at your face. I hope that's a good idea. We could try one with it up. [giggling] Yeah, with, like, one down. [knocking on door] Yes? - Can I come in? - Hi. Sure. Is Bonnie in bed? Yeah. We were trying out some new hairstyles. I think she's gonna test oneout on you in the morning. You two are becomingquite good friends again. I was hoping that we could do the same. Um, Bonnie's told me of the awful things that I have said to her. And I'm sure that I have saidand done much worse to you. You don't have toapologize for that, Lisa. Well, I'm-- I'm not apologizing. I can't apologize for thingsthat I don't remember. But I want to make you a promise. A promise? [gentle music] It seems to me that you and I used to really care for each other. I promise that I will do everything that I can to make it that way again. Well, I'll tell you what. Um, we've been invited toa party Sunday afternoon. And you said no because of me. No. Well, then, let's go. They're people that youdidn't used to like very much. That's in the past. Paul, I want to be your friend. You know, I never wanted to divorce you. [gentle music] Friends?

PAUL TEMPLE: You know, a mile-long hike through the woods wasnot the old Lisa's style. LISA TEMPLE: You're kidding. [laughing] Hey, maybe there's somethingto be said for the old Lisa. This was our special place, wasn't it? Well, I can't wait to see it. Do you remember coming up here? Yeah, I think so. But I certainly don'tremember coming this way. [laughing] We could drive to thefront door if we wanted to, but I like coming this way. Paul, it's beautiful. I'm glad you like it. You used to. I did? Are you sure? I'm sure. Oh. It's just like the cabin westayed in on our honeymoon. And then we came back, and you had it built so we would never forget. [sighing] Yeah. Here. Thanks. This place is really beautiful. How often did we come up here? - Every weekend. - Do you hunt? Mhm. Oh, don't worry, though, I couldn't hit a barn. So when you weren't outscaring the local wildlife, what did we do? Oh, walks in the woods. There's a pond back throughthere, actually, that you used to like skinny dipping in. Skinny dipping. Mhm. Well you know, I don't feelmuch like skinny dipping today. No? [gentle music] What do you feel like doing? [gentle music] Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean, Ken said-- He said that I need toshow you how much I love you. [gentle music] I hope I remember how to do this. This doesn't take any talent. It just takes sweetness, and warmth, and love. [gentle music] [fire crackling] I adjusted the trigger mechanism like you asked, took off the serial numbers, put on the same scope, likethe one you used in Chicago. You said you liked it Yeah. Yeah, that's good. That's real good. You know, I was a littlesurprised when you called. Jack didn't tell me anything was up. Yeah, well, this one's not for Jack. This is more of a labor of love. [ominous music] Yeah. That's what this is. [gentle music] Paul, the garage delivered your car. The guy said everything'sOK, but your brakes got disconnected or something. [WHISPERING] You know, Idon't have to go to work today. Paul? [WHISPERING] Oh, I don't think you should. [WHISPERING] I am so tired. You know what? I think I'm gonna go walk the dog. Mhm. [gentle music] [birds chirping] I don't remember the lasttime we went shopping together. That makes two of us. Do you have your list? Yeah, I've gotta get a new lipstick. Lisa, Jody asked me over this weekend. [giggling] [ominous music] MAN [IN HEAD]: Let me help you. Trust me. Now, I can solve this problem. [ominous music] Do you think you canhelp me pick out a blouse? I want a blue one that'll go with my new shoes. Bonnie, you've bought out half the stores now. Come on, it's just one blouse. Powder blue, with a low-cut neck. Yeah, we'll see what we can-- BONNIE TEMPLE: Lisa? Lisa, what's wrong? Bonnie, take these thingsand go back to the car, OK? Just wait for me there. Well, what are you gonna do? I just-- I'm gonna be five minutes, OK? OK. [ominous music] [shoes clacking] WESLEY: We're closed. Mrs. Temple. How are you feeling? Oh, fine. Wesley, right? Yeah. Yeah, right. It's good to see you. Mr. Temple said youmight not be able to make it down for a while. Yeah, I know. Um, Wesley, the night I was attacked, I was talking with a man. It was a tall man with a mustache. I think we're friends. Yeah, he's been a regular for a while. Real good dresser, big tipper. Do you know anything else about him? No, he doesn't talk to me much. He comes to visit you. Mm. Did you hear what we were talking about? No. I, uh-- I remember you crying once. Anything else? Nothing I didn't tell the police already. Well, any little thing would help. I mean, it doesn't matter how small. Maybe you were upset about your ring. My ring. WESLEY: Your engagement ring. I remember you taking itoff and showing it to him. I figured there must be something wrong with it. I'd never seen you take it off before. MAN [IN HEAD]: You got me. Thanks. [ominous music] Lisa! [tires screeching] Bonnie, you all right? Yeah. [honking] [SHOUTING] Hey! Watch where you're going, would you? I'm sorry I screamed. It just-- it reminded me so much of the accident. The accident? When my parents-- Your parents died in a car accident? You were in the car? [phone ringing] Hello? Mrs. Temple, it's Anna. The police just called. They want you to go downto the station right away. Did they say what they wanted? Detective Washburn said that they have found the men who attacked you. All right. Bonnie and I are almost home. I'll drop her off first. OK. Bye. [gentle music] DETECTIVE WASHBURN: Turns out they're a couple of guys that like to live high on other people's money. They were in your restaurantusing stolen credit cards. Thought you were a woman alone they could grab a couple more from. You recognize them? No. Doesn't matter. One of them had your cards,and the other confessed. What about my engagement ring? Our talker says you weren't wearing one. Well, he's probably lying, right? He said you had it on in the restaurant, but when they jumped you, you didn't have it. Well, that's not possible. I was just talking with thebartender at the restaurant. And he said that he saw me show it to the man that I was with that night. But I'm sure I wouldn't just give it to him. Look, I found this photo. I think this could be the manthat I was with that night. I saw someone that looked likehim watching my house today. Look, the departmentconsiders this case closed. And I'm not in the businessof finding missing boyfriends. [phone ringing in background] [INDISTINCT CHATTER IN BACKGROUND] I love my husband. Even if I wasn't getting along with him, I don't think I would just-- I know I wouldn't just give my ring away. I'm sorry. Mike. Yeah. Tell me this isn't who I think it is. OK. Big guy in the middle isn't Jack[inaudible],, the guy beside him is not one of his wise guys. Where'd you get this? The woman that was just here. Really. She doesn't look sleazy enoughto be one of Jack's friends. She owns the restaurant where this was taken. The wise guy, what's his name? Joe Dooley. We've never gotten anything on him, but rumor has it he does Jack's dirty work. I only saw him for a split second, but I'm sure that he was the man that I was with the night I was attacked. Well, did you tell the police? Yes, but I think it has moreto do with when I was leading a separate life from Paul. Separate life. Hm. Well, yeah, some people runaway from their problems. Some people burythemselves in their work. Do some people have affairs. Mm. But, uh, to tell you the truth,the Lisa Temple that I had in therapy became so cold and distant, I can't see her having an affair with any man. I don't understand why I pushed Paul away. When we make love-- Now, Lisa, I'm not so sure that-- No, Ken, it's all right. We've found each other again. I just hope that I haven'tdone something in the past that would push him away forever. [somber music] Yeah, here, try this color. OK. You know, I just might give those other girls some real competition. I think the boys aregonna have to take a number. [giggling] PAUL TEMPLE: Hi. Hi. [kissing] Hi, Bon. You look terrific! Now, why does thatcontinue to amaze people? Bonnie has a date tonight. A date? She's only 14. - Yeah? What's your point? Well, when I was 14-- never mind. Ooh. When you were 14, what? PAUL TEMPLE: Never mind. What did you do? What, I just helped her believe in herself. What are we gonna do tonight? Celebrate. Yeah? I called Jerry today and I told him I'm still in love with my wife. I don't think I'll divorce you. What do you think? [doorbell ringing] Oh, that must be Jody. I'll have to talk to him about his timing. [sighing] Yes? Hi, I'm Jody. Come on in, Jody. Thanks. Is, uh, Bonnie ready? Ready for what? Just ignore him. OK. BONNIE TEMPLE: Hi, Jody. Wow, you look great. So what do you two have planned for the evening? Oh, I don't know. I figured we'd pick up a pizzaand, I don't know, go get a video, go back to my house. Don't worry, my mom will be home. Why would I worry? [nervous chuckles] Um, Paul, I'll be home at 11. Well actually, she'll probably be home a little earlier because Igot to have the car home by 10. Ah, OK. You have a good time. Thanks. Lisa, I'm so happy. Thanks for coming back to us. [WHISPERING] Have a great time. Don't worry, I won't keep her. MAN [IN HEAD]: Don't worry, I won't keep her. PAUL TEMPLE [IN HEAD]: Bye, Mom, bye, Dad. See you soon, Carrie. [ominous music] Well, at least we have some time to ourselves. PAUL TEMPLE [IN HEAD]: Well, at least we have some time to ourselves. MAN [IN HEAD]: Don't worry, I won't keep her. PAUL TEMPLE [IN HEAD]: Well, at least we have some time to ourselves. [faint screeching sounds] What's wrong? I've been here before. I was standing right here,and somebody said don't worry, I won't keep her. And then you shut the door and said, at least now we'll have some time to ourselves. [ominous music] Uh-- [ominous music] Oh, no, Lisa. Lisa, wait. [suspenseful music] Go ahead. [suspenseful music] [crickets chirping] [ominous music] [gasping] PAUL TEMPLE: Lisa-- Oh, no. Oh, god. Oh my baby. Oh no, my baby. [sobbing] Bonnie and my parentswere looking after her so we could spend the weekend alone. Oh, god-- [sobbing] And there was a car accident. And Bonnie was the only one that survived. Get away. Get out. Get out! Get out! It's your fault! Lisa, please-- It's your fault! If you hadn't-- you didn't love her anymore. If you hadn't put her in that car, none of this would have ever, ever happened. [SHOUTING] Get out! Get out! Go away! [sobbing] [crickets chirping] [somber music] [car door shutting] [somber music] [car starting] [somber music] [dog barking in distance] [car starting] [ominous music] Mrs. Temple. [sobbing] Mrs. Temple. [WAILING] Go away! Please, Mrs. Temple. Just get out! Go away! It hurts me to watch youdestroy your family again. You've pushed everyone wholoves you out of your life. Paul, Bonnie. Bonnie has nothing to do with this. She does. She lived. It was an accident, Lisa. Paul loved Carrie. He not only lost her and his parents, but he lost you, as well. It's gonna be all right, honey. It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right. [crying softly] [insects chirping] LISA TEMPLE: Paul? [crickets chirping] Paul? [fire crackling] I thought I'd find you here. I'm sorry. I'm pushing you awayagain, and I don't mean to. I don't know if you rememberme saying this to you, Lisa. But I can't-- I can't fight anymore. That's why I-- that'swhy I wanted the divorce. I remember. What happened to Carrie was not your fault. I know, I know I blamed you. [gentle music] Paul, you said yourselfthat I was another woman. [gentle music] I know I'm-- I'm responsible, I amresponsible, for everything that that Lisa said and did. But this Lisa loves you with all her heart. [gentle music] Paul, you're the onlyman that I've ever loved, and I don't want to lose you twice. [gentle music] I can't live with you hating me. Then we'll just have to keep loving each other, no matter what happens. [gentle music] [birds chirping] [ominous music] [birds chirping] [ominous music] [birds chirping] [ominous music] Lisa? [ominous music] Yep. Yeah, you better get out of here. Find yourself a good alibi. I don't understand. Who are you? What are you doing? I'm here to make the pain go away. [ominous music] It doesn't mean anything to me anymore. I don't have anywhere to go. There is nobody that I can count on. Hey, hey. You got me. And you know I'll do anything for you. Anything. Now, I can solve this problem. Everything's gotten so crazy, I don't even know what I want anymore. Let me help you. I just want him out of my life. He will be. Trust me. Joe? Joe, you've misunderstood. No, I didn't misunderstand. You gave me this. You told me you hated him. No, it's OK now. Everything's OK now. No, it's not OK. PAUL TEMPLE: Lisa? Lisa? LISA TEMPLE: [SHOUTING] Paul, run! [suspenseful music] [SHOUTING] Paul! Paul, run! [suspenseful music] [gunshot] [groaning] [suspenseful music] [gunshot] [suspenseful music] [gunshot] [gunshots] [gunshot] [suspenseful music] [gun cocking] Your wife wanted you to feelthe pain that she felt. Pain. That's what I do best. [gunshot] [suspenseful music] There were pictures of youall over Mr. Dooley's apartment. Some of the other detectives figure he was obsessed with you, andstarted stalking your husband. What do you think? I think he was a man whohurt people for his friends, and you were his friend. There will be no charges, Mrs. Temple. You shot him in self-defense. I never wanted to hurt Paul. Joe may have thought I did, but I never wanted to kill my husband. I see you got your ring back. Yeah. You get better, OK? Good morning, Lisa. Well, looks like we're goingto trying giving you back your husband one more time. Well, I'll leave you two alone. How are you feeling? I brought you a dress. Doris says it's much nicer than the last one. I'm so sorry. Oh, it's OK. I did everything that Icould to make you despise me. Lisa, we don't have to do this now. I was cruel. We're gonna start over. You forgive me, evenafter everything that I did. I'll take my chances. [gentle music]
