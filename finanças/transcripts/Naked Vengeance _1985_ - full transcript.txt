Freeze, police! No. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry Carla. I love you. Hello, Mrs. Harris. Detective Russo. - Oh yes, I remember. - May I? - Please do. Why don't we go in the other room? Please sit down. - Thank you. What is it Detective? Have you talked to some of the witnesses? There aren't any witnesses Mrs. Harris. That's impossible. There were all those people in the windows. They saw everything. - Nothing. Nobody will admit they saw a darn thing. - Well what about the girl, the one who was attacked? She says she can't remember. - What the hell does she mean she can't remember? My husband died trying to help her! Hey take it easy Mrs. Harris. Just calm down, alright? - Calm down? Look you've gotta do something. Alright listen, listen to me. Let me tell you how these things work in the real world okay? We know the girl. She's got three priors herself, two on prostitution, one on possession. She's a junkie. - Oh god. - And she probably knows the slime that did this to her but she's scared and you can bet she's got every reason to be. He'll probably kill her if she tries to talk. - Well can't you give her some kind of protection? Mrs. Harris don't be naive. It's not that easy. Now I'm afraid there's no way we're gonna get this girl on the witness stand. I don't believe this. This isn't happening. Look, tell her she doesn't have to testify. Tell her to give me his name. I'll testify. We already tried that one. - This whole thing is insane. - You're right, Mrs. Harris. It's insane, it's crazy. But we're just gonna have to live with it right now. Well I don't have to live with it. Look, you didn't know him. Mark was, well he was just... I've gotta do something. Mrs. Harris I know how you feel. Just remember, if you try to break the law you're no better than the guy that did this to him so don't get any ideas. Now I'm sorry, but that's the way it is. And we'll contact you if we come up with anything. - I appreciate that. - Okay. - Look, if you need to get in touch with me I'll be at my parents' house in Silver Lake. I think I need to get away from this for a while. That sounds like a good idea. If anything comes up I'll get in touch. I can find my way out. J' There's so many wounded losers J' J' So many broken hearts J' J' Frightened strangers scared of the dangers of love J' J' Well I've heard all their empty phrases J' J' They might as well be lies J' J' I've given my heart, I've given my trust J' J' And I've cried J' J' So I give you my heart baby it's yours forever J' J' But please be there to catch me when I fall J' - There's another one there, get 'em boy. - Woo. - Bullshit, bullshit. Hey, stop it. It's spelled D-U-C-K, not D-U-K. - Don't embarrass me. - Excuse me. Yeah? - Could you fill it up please? - Sure. Ah Jesus. Hey Sparky why don't you get this piece of shit fixed man? It would work if you quit kicking it. Carla? Hello Burke. I thought that was you. Woo, Carla. Well kiss my ass. What are you doing back in town, slummin'? Hey Sparky, me and Carla went to high school together if you can believe that. - Shit, I didn't know you went to school Burke. That's $10 even. - Oh yeah. We had some high old times at Silver Lake High. - Is that right? - Mm-hm. Didn't we Carla? I guess we did Burke. Well, shit, you've done alright. Carla's an actress. - Is that right? - Not anymore. You're still the prettiest girl in town. - Thank you Burke, I have to- - Say, where is your hubby? You got hitched didn't you? Oh I... You came up here to get away from the old man. Listen, if you're looking for a little outside action just give me a call. Look Burke, I really have to go. - Sure. You're the salt of the Earth Carla. Don't let us keep you. WOO-WEG. Bitch. - Oh Carla. - Mom. Oh Carla. Oh what a terrible thing. How are you? - Mom I'm fine, I'm fine. On Daddy. It's okay honey, look, you're home now. We're gonna take good care of you. - Oh hi. - Oh, good morning ma'am. Is Mrs. Olson around? No I'm sorry, Mom's still asleep. Can I help you? - Well I was doing some yard work here for Mr. Olson and I was wondering if I can have a glass of water? - Oh sure, just wait here a second. I'll get it. - Thanks. Here you go. Boy you really were thirsty, huh? Yeah I guess I was. Well I guess I better be getting back to work now. Thanks. Here's your glass. Nice legs Daddy. - Hi honey. - Hi. I hear you guys are going to Uncle Aaron's in Mendocino this weekend. Yeah we're going up tonight. Wouldn't you like to come? No you go ahead, I'll be fine. - Are you sure? - Yes. Listen I better get to the supermarket or dinner's gonna be late. - Okay, see you later. - Bye-bye. Hey sugar. You and your car look like a million dollars but you're driving ain't worth a plug nickel. Would you mind moving? I'd like to get by. Sure. I better check out my truck, you might've hit it. Come on, I didn't hit your truck. Not so fast, honey, you just, let me take a good look here. Yeah it looks pretty good. What is it with you people? Is everybody in this town a pervert? Oh now you don't have to go calling people names now darling. Look just move the damn truck okay? Arnie. What's the trouble here? Nothing Sheriff, I'm just trying to explain to this lady here- - Look, first he almost hits me and then he won't let me go. What kind of town is this? Oh this? This is the kind of town where people have a little respect for the law. Even people with fancy cars. Now, you think I could see your license please? Los Angeles. Well if you'll just calm down a minute Mrs. Harris we'll see if we can get to the bottom of this. Now is the true Arnie, were you stopping this young lady from going about her business? Of course not Sheriff. I was just backing out of here and she come barreling through here like some sort of damn freeway. That's not true. - If you just hold on a minute you'll get your chance. Go ahead Arnie. Well I was just taking a look to see if there is damage is all. This is ridiculous. You know I didn't hit your truck and yet you insist I'm playing some stupid adolescent game. Did she hit your truck Arnie? Well, no I guess not. - Well then you're free to go on about your business. Okay, Sheriff. - And I guess you can be on your way too ma'am. Thank you. As far as games I think you're old enough to take care of yourself. One thing's for sure, if I don't looks like nobody else is going to. - You drive carefully now and have a nice day. - The finest in California. - Oh really? Well in that case I'll take those three steaks. _ Qkay. Anything else I can help you with? No thanks, that'll be all. You're new here huh? Oh no, not really. I was born in Silver Lake. That was a long time ago. You plan to stay a long while? I haven't decided yet. - Well, if there's anything you ever might need that's special just ask for me. My name's Fletch. It's nice to meet you, I'm Carla. Carla. How about you and I getting together some time? Look, I really have to be going. Please put this on the Olson account. - Hey don't forget that's the best beef in town. Well we're off. Okay Mom. Give Uncle Aaron and Aunt Betty my love. You know they'd love to see you. Why don't you come with us? Oh I don't think so. You mean you'd pass up a weekend of Canasa and Billy Graham on the radio? It's tough, I know. Carla, why don't you go out tonight? I don't really think I'm up to it. No I think I'll just stay home and watch some TV. Look, you listen to me Carla Jean. We won't be back until Sunday. I don't want you rattling around this big old house all by yourself. Mom. Look, you need to get out. Go to the movies or go down to the tavern. Be with people your own age. Well, I... You'll probably find lots of your old high school friends there. - Okay. - That's a girl. Now we've gotta get going. Where's your father? Luther! Don't worry about me. Bye Daddy. ' BYE-bye. - Bye dear. - Okay. Have a good weekend. - You too. - Get lost. - Hey. Come back when you're old enough. Hey, good evening. Hey Ray what was that all about huh? I had to through Timmy out again. Oh. Hey. Carla. Oh my god, Carla, is that you? Estelle? Look at you. You're gorgeous. You're simply gorgeous. - Oh, thanks. Willis, isn't she gorgeous? Come on, sit down, sit. Stop that. Carla, this slob I'm sorry to say is my husband. - It's nice to meet you. - Hi. - Oh how long has it been? - Years and years. Let's not talk about how many though. What a beautiful outfit, really. Oh, thanks. I'll say. Knock it off. But then I get you're used to that, having men falling at your feet in LA. After all the styles are a little more risque than here in Silver Lake. I don't suppose you remember me? Oh of course I do David. Please come sit down. Oh it's great to see you. You look wonderful. - I'll bet she remembers your little wife too. You remember Terry Halprin don't you dear? Unfortunately she has to stay home with the children tonight. I mean someone has to right David? You're so sweet Estelle. Do you have any little ones Carla? - No, we never- - We understand. You're, I mean living in the fast lane in LA really doesn't leave much time and then of course there is your career. I saw a commercial you did once. Something to do with gardening steps. Plastic wrap. - I could never have been through your move. But then you gave up your career for family too didn't you dear? You married that marvelous man who designed and built all those fantastic buildings and made gobs and gobs of- - Money, yes. I think I need a drink. Fucking A. Wow, take a look at that. Got a nice ass. - That's alright. - Sure does. - Hi. - Hi. Boy you look like you could use a drink. You read my mind. - Try my specialty. - What is it? That would be telling. Trust me, you'll love it. - Okay. Wow. What do you call it? It's called a cherry bomb. What the hell's going on here? - Little miss rich bitch just gave Ray a bender. Hey let me. I want to apologize for this afternoon. I guess we just got off on the wrong foot. Look, let's just forget it. Give me my key please. Can I make it up to you? Let me take you out to dinner. Look, I said forget it. - Look I know a nice little place we could- No, don't be like that. Look I just want to go home. Hey I know what you want baby. No, no. No, please don't. A little munch baby. Let me go. I said let me go! What are you, I said go! Excuse me, is Sheriff Cates in? Sorry he's not in right now ma'am. Sheriff Cates. Morning Mrs. Harris right, from LA? - Something I can do for you? - Yes there is. Alright, what? Last night I caught that kid Timmy peeping in my bedroom window. Yeah? Is that all you have to say about it? - Maybe you should keep your curtains closed. I guess I should've expected as much. Look, I really think you're making a little bit too much out of all this. Timmy's just a boy. He's got a boy's normal curiosity. Now there's no harm done. I'll talk to him alright? - Great. Oh and while you're at it maybe you can teach those other jerks some manners. What do you mean? Supposed I told you that butcher creep molested me outside the tavern last night? Look these guys are a little wild, but they're just having fun with you. Why don't you just relax a little bit? If anything they were just trying to pay you a complement. Now just calm down. It'll make my job a lot easier. - I can see it was a waste of time coming to you. Thanks a lot Sheriff. Sure. - You're kidding me? - I'm not kidding you. You seem pretty upset about it too. - Well she's making a big deal over nothing. ' Yeah, nothing? - Hey I'm the one that should be complaining. Yeah sure. First she gives me the big come on and then when I do it she gets all upset and gets hostile. Alright Fletch. She's got some serious problems. - Alright, alright, listen Fletch we'll let it go this time. She's a pretty lady, but in the future would you do me a favor? What's that? Save me the grief man. Stay the hell away from Carla Harris. - Hey Mr. Burke. - Hey Timmy. Can you buy me a six pack? I'll give you the money. Oh come on in, I'll buy you a beer. No way Burke. I could lose my license. - Hey what are you worried about Ray? There's nobody here but just us chickens. Oh hell, come on. If I get busted... - Drink up my man. - Woo. - Go for it Timmy. - Take another one. Take another one. So you understand. - Tip it back then boy. Tip it back a little more. A little more. - I'll say. There you go, watch that bottle. Put down a beer there Timmy. You're not a kid. That bitch. What? Tight ass closet nympho that's who. - Who? - Yeah. - The Olson chick. - Harris. - Huh? - Harris. Carla Harris. Used to be Olson, now it's Harris. Oh, oh, oh. She's a bitch anyway. She gave this whole town the finger. - Yeah. - Yeah. I'd sure like to give her the finger. - The only place you ever had your finger was up your butt. Whoa. - I got a better one. - What? - When she gave old Fletch that shot in the cajones. No wait a minute, hey. Cut the shit. Hey cut the shit. Alright, alright, alright, Christ. Tables cost money around here. Fuck the table, there's plenty. I want a beer. HEY- She's good looking though. Sure would like to see what she's got underneath them fancy clothes of hers huh? I already did. Fuck you. I'm not shitting you. I went up to the Olson's to do some work yesterday and all she had on was a pair of panties. - Bullshit. - Just panties? And she was digging me watching too. Yeah, I believe that. Just like an actress. What? - She was an actress. - Oh yeah. - Even in high school she thought she was hot shit. Always into plays and prancing around the stage. Wouldn't let anybody her pants then neither. Yeah that's for sure. - Probably saving it for some Hollywood producer. Yeah. - I bet she gave it up to get in that dog food commercial. Dog food commercial. Yeah, a fucking dog food commercial. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey you know what? ' What? - I'd like to go over to that fancy ass house of hers and teach her a little lesson. - Yeah. - Yeah. ' Why don't you? Yeah Fletch. Yeah. - Well, I would if I could catch her alone. - Yeah. - She is alone. - What? - Hmm? Oh yeah? - The old man went up to Mendocino for the weekend, took the old lady with him. - Where'd you hear that? - How do you know that? - I heard 'em telling Carla about it yesterday. - You shittin' me boy? - Well, well. - Fletch why don't you put your money where your mouth is? Hey, maybe I will, man. - Huh? - Shut up Burke. I'll do it. Shit. Look at him. On the other hand. - How about it? - What do you think, huh? What do you guys say? - What about it Fletch? Let's go. Hey. Hey, heY- Hey keep it down. Shit. - Hey we're going over here. - Okay. Surprise. Party time! Nobody home. No. You've been so nice to me and the boys that we thought we'd pay you a visit. Hey I'm first. Hey wait for me. - Come with me - No! You're a wild one. _ No! Oh please stop. Come on. Oh please stop. No more. Please stop. God. Hey what are you guys doing? Stop that! - Go for her, go for her. Hey Timmy, come on boy. Looks like Carla's up late tonight. She'll be surprised to see us. She wasn't expecting us back until tomorrow. - You didn't call her? - I didn't bother. I wanted to surprise her. I thought maybe we could do something nice tomorrow and have a picnic down by the lake. That would be nice. Jesus Christ! Stop. Stop, what are you guys doing? Hey what's the matter with you? - No! - It was your idea. Not like this, we gotta get out of here. - Ah shut up, get over here you big pile of shit. We have her now. What are you worried about? Have a drink. - What the hell? - Carla! ' Stop! You fucked with us? Oh no. Mother! Gotta fix things. She's dead. - Shut up. - She's dead! You shut up for Christ sakes. Keep cool. You, you killed them all. You killed her. - Come on, take it easy. - I never wanted this. I never meant this. - Be fucking cool. - I'm going to the cops. - Stop! - This wasn't my idea. - Stay here. - I'm telling them everything. - Stop, oh god. - Be quiet. Come on, we gotta get out of here. Jesus Christ. Come on you piece of shit. Come on. Come here, come here. Give me that. Yeah? Get it? Yeah. Leave no prints. Yeah, it'll work. Timmy did it. Timmy did it all. The old man got him. Let's get out of here. Riley. Have the lab test it. - Okay sir. How is she? - Well a few superficial wounds from the shotgun blast. Nothing serious. She hit her head when she fell. She'll be alright. There's always plenty of blood in a head wound. What about him? Do you think it's possible? Possible, but I can't be sure. That's a hell of a hole in his stomach. The impact might have thrown him three, four feet. Olson was a tough old bird. If Timmy had dropped the gun up here Olson might've been strong enough to crawl over to it. - Sheriff they've got Mrs. Olson in the wagon and they're ready for Mr. Olson if you're finished here? Yeah, take him away. Why would he do this? You really think Timmy did this Frank? Well it's plain Sheriff. Mr. Olson came out with the gun. Timmy panicked, jumps him, they get into a struggle. Timmy gets the gun away. He shoots Mrs. Olson who's rushing towards him then he turns around and shoots Mr. Olson. He drops the gun and runs thinking Olson's dead. You heard what the doc said, old man Olson was a pretty tough guy. Could've had enough life in him to pull the trigger. - That's a hell of a scenario Frank except for one thing. Olson was left handed. What's the matter with you? I don't know. I guess I just don't feel like working out today. You know Ray if you hadn't let that kid into the bar last night none of this would've happened. - Hey, you guys were the ones that wanted him in. Don't go trying to blame it on me. ' Shut up! What's done is done. The sooner we forget about it the better. Sure Burke, we can forget about it. You're the one that did the killing, you and Fletch. Hold him, hold him. - Alright, alright, we're in this in the same way. You understand? Let's not do something stupid. That's right. We all went up there for the same reason. Remember? We didn't mean for anybody to get hurt. It just happened. It was an accident! Yeah that's right. Okay, okaY- - Guys, I wanna go bowling. - Sure, sure. That's right! Yeah. I guess. - Yeah, yeah I understand what you're saying. Alright, alright. Thank you Dr. Fellows, thank you. Sheriff. - Frank I think I'm gonna take a run over to the hospital and try to get some information out of Carla Harris. - You mean there's been a change in her condition? No, they say she's still catatonic, but I'm gonna give it a go. Alright. Hey Arnie, Arnie come here. ' HEY, What's going on? Really, what is it? Carla Harris is still alive. - Alive, what do you mean that she's alive? No shit. I got it from Cate's deputy Frank Winston. - Goddamn Timmy. - But she's a vegetable right? I mean she can't talk or nothing like that. She won't be that way forever. What are we gonna do? - Well for openers we get the fuck out of town that's what. That's great Sparky, right after the shit hits the fan five guys book out. What's that gonna tell Cates? Well what are we gonna do? Nothing. That's what we're gonna do, we're gonna do nothing. We're gonna stay real cool. We gotta stick together on this guys. I'll keep after Winston. Come on. - We're talking about the murder of three people. Now can't you just bend the rules for me a little bit just one time? Sheriff I cannot possibly allow you to question Carla Harris. Why the poor girl can't even talk. Can't or won't? What are you trying to imply? I thought you had an open and shut case? Well it's not an open and shut case. I'm not satisfied yet alright? And right now that woman is the only witness I've got. Alright, you want to see her I'll show you, but no questions. She's drawn a curtain across everything that's happened since the rape and the murder of her parents. Now we're trying to open that curtain, but I don't know how long it will take. Can she hear us? Does she know we're here? - She's the only one who knows the answer to that. - I don't know if you can hear me or not lady, but I've got a feeling you can and you ought to know I think you know a damn- That's enough Sheriff. Mrs. Harris is not under suspicion here. Alright Doctor. We'll do it your way, but I'm gonna have to talk to her sooner or later. - Well you're gonna have to give it some time. Time is the best cure. You'll get your answers. - How much time? Well it could be tomorrow. It could be next week, next month, next year. - Alright, that's fine for you but I need some answers now. I will inform you the moment there's a change in her condition. Look, what if we brought up a specialist from San Francisco, had a second opinion on this? Maybe we'd get some answers. Let me go! Get away! Help! He's in there, he's in there, he's in there. Go! Leave me alone. - That's right Jessie, let it out, let it out Jessie. It's alright. We can talk about it. Don't be afraid. It's going to be alright. I saw him, I did. Jessie, listen Jessie. - I saw him, he's in there. - It's not your husband. It's not your husband. It's another man Jessie, it's another man. - I saw him, I saw him. - It's another man Jessie. It's another man. - I saw him. - I know. - I saw him. He hurt me, he hurt me. - And now you want to hurt him Jessie right? Oh yes. Now you want to hurt him don't you? Oh yes. I want you to tell me about it. Tell me about your revenge fantasies Jessie. Let it out. Tell me, what do you want to do to him? I want him to feel the pain I felt. I want him to be frozen paralyzed with fear. Oh yes. I will tie him down. I'll hold the guns right between his eyes and I'll shoot him. I'll shoot him. We're closed. Don't I have time for one drink? Well I'm supposed to close up, but ah what the hell. It's just one drink, eh? What'll you have? J and B, make it a double. What brings you to Silver Lake? - I was driving back to LA when my car broke down. It won't be ready until tomorrow so now I need to find a place for tonight. - Oh, well I might be able to make a suggestion on that. What did you have in mind? Surprise. You. Come on, take it easy. You don't want to do that. Pick up that bottle. Pick it up. I said pick it up. - Listen, we only meant to have a good time, but it just got out of hand. Don't you understand? We were all drunk and- Pour it over yourself. What? Pour it. You heard me, just do it. What are you gonna do? Pour it all. Please no. God, no. No, oh god. Burn bastard. Out. ' Hey, what are you doing? - Old Ray must've pissed off one guy too many. Jesus what a way to go. Who could be that pissed off? I can think of one person. No way. She's alive but she's a basket case. Come on let's get out of here. Sounds like a good idea. - Frank. - Yeah? Why don't you go on over to the morgue and see how Doctor Richard is coming along? I'll call you later. _ Qkay. - Cates checks with Dr. Fellows up in the hospital every day and she's still out of it. Fellows says she could come around at any time or maybe never. So we're okay? - No we're not okay if she comes to we're all in trouble. Christ you don't think she did it? A woman can't, there's gotta be a guy. Look I don't care what you guys think I'm for going up there and wasting that bitch tonight Burke we can't, it's too public a place. No way. The other night was one thing. It was just something in the stars. It's not like we went out there to kill nobody. You goddamn idiot it's either her or us. - Yeah I think he's right. We gotta get a hold of Arnie and figure out what we're gonna do. - Yeah you're right. - Let's go. - Now look I'm sorry Sheriff, but the answer's still no. - With all the hell that's broken loose around here Doctor I don't see how I can take no for an answer very much longer. Well look we're just beginning to make some real progress with Carla. As you can see she's responding to outside stimuli. She still hasn't said anything? - No, not a word since she's been here. Hey Doctor I'm up against the wall here. I don't see how I can get going with this thing until I have her story about what happened anyway. - Well I'm afraid any questions about what happened that night just might reinduce her trauma. If that were to happen, I don't know, she might slip back and we may never bring her back again. A chance we may just have to take. Please, give it a little more time. I really think we're getting close. A week? I'll give it another week, but that's all. Yeah. - Shit. - Alright. Come on Arnie it's up to you now babe. Looking smart and fresh boys. - Sheriff. - How you doing? - How you doing Sheriff? - How you doing Sheriff? Hell of a fire, huh? ' 9h Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry about Ray. - Alright! - Any idea who did it? - No, I'm working on it. - What, first the Olsons then Ray, been a hell of a week. - Well at least we know who killed the Olsons. Yeah. Who would've thought a crazy kid like Timmy would've done something like that? I'm not so sure he did Arnie. Oh really? I heard it was pretty obvious. - I heard she's in really bad shape, way out of it. - Yeah that's right, she was, but I was just up at the hospital a little while ago and she seemed a lot better. Looks like you could use a little work on your approach there Sparky. Fuck you Burke. See you guys later. - See you Sheriff. - Yes, see you later Sheriff. Yeah I think that son of a bitch is playing a game with us, mm-hm. Think he knows anything? No he's just sniffing. I don't like it. He said Carla's getting better. You know what that means. Well I think I'm gonna go up there and check it out tomorrow. What are you nuts? Listen asshole. We gotta know what's going on. We gotta protect ourselves. - Yeah. - He's right Fletch. Good morning Carla. How are you feeling today? Yes, it's a beautiful day. You know if you like you can take a stroll around the grounds. And then when you get back come in and see me. That's right, good. Well, look at what we've got here. Okay baby I'm coming right in 'cause I've got something special for you. Yeah, baby, I've got something just for you. Woo-hoo. Woo, baby. I love it. Yes I know. YES. Oh. - I like it, yes, that's good, that's good. Surprise. Drown bastard. I was just making a routing check around the hospital grounds. We sort of like to keep an eye on our patients. That's when I discovered the boat. I went over to take a closer look and Jesus Christ. - You know that makes five dead in one week. That's more than we usually see in a whole year. But never anything like this. John this is crazy. Yeah it is. - I thought I'd seen everything, but this is atrocious. Castration. Looks like you got your work cut out for you this time John. - You got the patients in their rooms Doctor? I'd like to start questioning them now. What is it? It's Carla, she's disappeared. We've looked everywhere for her but she's gone. - Riley I want you to put out an all points bulletin on Carla Harris right now and then tear these hospital grounds apart. Frank come with me. God I hope nothing's happened to her. I just can't believe that Carla could've possibly had anything to do with this. She was getting more and more responsive every day. There were no signs of repressed hostility what so ever. It doesn't make sense. - Now let's just take a look at what we've got here for a minute. One, we just fished a castrated stiff out of the lake. Two, the patient was here this morning, but suddenly nowhere to be found. I don't know what that tells me Doctor but where I stand it makes Carla Harris a prime suspect. What do you make of that? Blind justice. - Hey I'm telling you no one's safe around here with that crazy bitch running around loose. Yeah. Now she killed twice already and any one of you could be next. I say we arm ourselves, form a posse and turn this town inside out. Yeah. Yeah, let us have her, come on. What the hell's going on here Fletch? - I'm organizing you a little help Sheriff. We figure you could use it. Yeah. - Well you figured wrong. Now I want all you people to just simmer down and go on home. This is police business. - I'm afraid that's not gonna cut it Sheriff. These people have families and kids to protect. Now what the hell are you gonna do about it? Yeah. What are you gonna do about it Sheriff? Yeah. What I will do, what I will do is arrest the first man that interferes or obstructs me and my men from doing our jobs. Now get the hell out of here so we can go back to work. What makes you so gung-ho in the first place Fletch? Haven't you got anything better to do? Ray and Burke were good friends of ours. Yeah that's right. That's right. They were, they were. Who's out there? Oh it's you for Christ sakes Riley. Something the matter? I don't know. I heard some noises out back. - Well I better check it out while you gas me up. Yeah good idea. Hey Riley, see anything back there? No nothing but a lousy cat. With this Harris chick around though we can't take any chances. Yeah, right, well thanks. Alright, that's it. - See you later. - Take it easy. Hello Sparky. ' No! This is Unit Four. The Harris woman just ran down our roadblock on Cottonwood Road in a brown '68 LTV heading east. We're in pursuit. Alert all units. Please alert all units. - We spotted Carla Harris heading east on Cottonwood Road. Hit it. She can't be too hard to find. Hell, what does a city girl know about these woods? - That city girl was raised around here Frank. What do you want to bet she knows these woods like the back of her hand? Come on. That's the end of line Sheriff. There's nothing down there but a drop off. - Alright let's pack it in and wait for some light. We'll cordon off the area and come back when we can see something. Yeah? Arnie, she got Sparky. _ 5parkY- Jesus, how, what happened? Crushed him under a car and took off. Cates and his men followed her into the woods. Shit. - Well look, I'm rounding up some of the boys from town. We better find her before Cates does. Yeah we better. You sit tight. We'll pick you up on the way out okay? Right. Hey! Jesus. Oh god. No, no! No, no! There she is! ' G0, go. Punch it, come on, let's get out of here, come on. Come on let's get her. She's going up to the house. Come on guys, let's go. - Come on, you gotta run faster, hurry up. Get her. Right over there guys, let's go. - Come on, she's not that far ahead. We gotta get her. Come on everyone join in. We're gonna get Olson. - Go! - Hey come on, let's go. Come on, hey. It's Olson. Come on, we're gonna get the girl. Oh my god. - Inside. - Hurry up, this way. ' Carla! Come on out! Come on. - Better get that shotgun, we'll blast her out. Come on guys, over here. She's up in the house. Come out and talk to us. We're gonna get you Carla. - Hey baby we know you're in there, come on out. Come on out Carla! - Come on now. - We know you're in there. Come on out or we'll blast you out. - You can't run away from us, we know you're in there. We're gonna get you. Are we gonna let her get away with this? - No. - No way. - Let's burn her out. - Burn her, yeah. - We're gonna get in there and get you. Come on out or we're gonna burn the goddamn house down. Come on out, come on out. Gonna shoot them or not? Let's burn her out. Kind of hot in there, huh? Yeah. That should cook her sweet little ass. Burn her out. Come on fellas, move out. - I'm only gonna ask you this once, what happened here? We chased her into the house. Wanted to smoke her out. The fire just got out of hand. Was it you Fletcher? Hey, it was an accident okay? - Absolutely. - Absolutely. - Besides look at it this way, the troubles are over. That murdering bitch is dead. Hell, nobody could've lived through that. Alright we're through here! Beer is on me. Then give me the shoot down here and then come up for a close up. Riley. Listen, go look around here and check out everything. Hey Fletch. - Yeah? - You know the way you were carrying on last night somebody might almost get the idea that you figured to be next on her list. What are you talking about? The way I helped you last night you ought to be giving me a medal instead of a hard time. - First Ray, then Burke, Sparky and now Arnie. I wonder what she had against those guys anyway huh Fletch? Hey, beats me. Yeah it's almost like she was taking it out on them for what Timmy did to her folks. - She was a loonie, she didn't know what she was doing. Kind of strange though huh? The way everyone of her victims just happened to be one of your buddies. So what does that prove? I got a lot of friends. I'm not saying it proves anything, I'm just making an observation that's all. Alright. But you know I can't help thinking, too bad I never got Carla's side of the story about what happened that night. If I had things might've turned out different. Maybe, Carla's dead. Dead people don't talk. At least I don't think they do. Let me tell you something Fletch. Hey Cates, just get off my back okay? I'll see you tomorrow Fletch. Okay, you all through back there? YGP- Alright, I'll get the light. Okay, have a good night. Catch you later. You want me to lock the door? - Yeah I'll get the back. - Okay. Hey George! - Put up quite a struggle with whoever did this. John, do you suppose Carla Harris is still alive? Yeah. The question is how many more does she have to kill before it's over? Hey Sheriff you got a call from LA. It was patched through from the office. Some Detective Russo. Yes, it's Cates. What can I do for you? Yeah, this is Detective Russo, LAPD. I'm trying to locate a Carla Harris. What do you want with her? Yeah, it's in connection with the murder of her husband. We've apprehended a suspect who fits the description of the killer, but we need Carla to make a positive ID before we can book him. Cates? Cates are you there? Yeah. - Listen, I can only hold this guy 24 hours so if you can get me in touch with Mrs. Harris, it would- - You're too late Russo. - What? - Carla Harris died last night, an accident. I'm really sorry to hear that. Yeah I'm sorry to have to tell you. Thank you for your help Sheriff. You're welcome. She's all finished here. That's the bar there. He's in there, you sure? - Come on. - Here's your money. Baby, you're mighty fine. What else do you like? You around here very much? Oh maybe. What's your name? My name's Carla. You like the name? - I want to take you around here a little bit and show you where it's at. Come on, that's it. Really come on. Easy now. I know you're in a hurry, yeah. Now. What the fuck is this? - Don't you want to know how this thing works? It's easy. - Don't you want to know how this thing works? No please. Shit it's you. J' You tell me that your tomorrow J' J' Is the one thing that you can't give J' J' You say that you need me but promises scare you away J' J' So hold me like it's forever J' J' If you have to just pretend J' J' And maybe the feeling will make you want to stay J' J' But I still have the love J' J' Than take a chance on losing J' J' than never, never love at all J' J' So I'll give you my heart baby it's yours forever J' J' But please be there to catch me when I fall J' J' 'Cause I'd still rather love J' J' Than take a chance I'll lose it J' J' Than never, never love at all J' J' So I'll give you my heart baby it's yours forever J' J' But please be there to catch me when I fall J'
