And cut! That is a wrap! Oh, and, uh, crew, I'm not paying overtime, so get the hell out of here. What? Oh, oh, did you want to yell cut? Oh. Okay, here. Tell your daddy that I said you're welcome for bringing you on here. Dumb kid. So, how was it? - Juego. - It was great. Addison, so the-the choreography for the chorus, yeah, wasn't quite next level. - Oh. Oh. - But pretty damn close. Nice job, ladies. And you... Oh, what did we do to deserve you, Eden Chase? Yes. Okay. Okay, okay. It was a great first week. Now let's try to remember that we still have Maui after the buzz party, so let's try not to destroy our livers tonight, okay? All right, I'll meet you out back in ten. Okay. Please! Oh, I just... Please! Fine. Ede, baby girl. Would you please take a photo with Cheri? She's been having starry eyes for you all week, and I'm about to give her a black eye if she asks me one more time. - Sure. Happy to. - Thank you. Here. One more. - Perfect. - Thank you so much! I've been a fan since you and Lee Vance were together. Oh, oh, um, I shouldn't have mentioned him. Should I? I'm so sorry. Oh, my gosh, I'm so stupid. It's fine, the tabloids won't let me forget that chapter of my life, anyway. Hey, you did a great job on Dara for the video. Yes! You beat me back to my 20s, and for that, I love you. Well, thank you. It was an honor. Have your purse, Ede. Are you gonna change? Yeah. Has anyone seen my phone? Oh, uh... - Uh, excuse me, Ms. Chase. - Who? - Hi. Is this yours? - Oh. I'm sorry, I was actually asked to give it directly to Ms. Chase. - Oh. - Thank you. - Um... - Uh, Jackson. Studio security. - Hm. - Thank you, Jackson. Great job out there. I wasn't supposed to watch, but it was, uh, it was pretty hard to look away sometimes. I'm sorry. It's too much. No, no. It's very sweet. Thank you. And, you know, in the future if anyone tells you you can't watch, tell them I said you can. Oh. Thank you, miss. - Eden. - Thank you, Eden. Okay, guys, um, sorry to interrupt. Get home safe. - Thank you. - Oh, we will. - Thanks for stopping by. - Security. Whoo! Ai, Dios. Eden, for a minute there, I literally couldn't breathe. If I had to breathe, I would have gagged. - I am gagged. - Forget it, boys. You're happily married, and he is happily mine. Oh, sorry, dear, he was clearly into Ede. Ede, no number? Seriously? What? - Oh, my God. - All right, let's do this... Oh. - Where'd the car go? - I don't know. - I'm leaving with the boys. - Ede, I'll ride with you. Great. See you guys back at the house. - Bye. See ya. - Okay. Bye. Oh, there's... Oh, there's the car, I see it. - Oh. Okay. - Yeah, it's coming. Yeah. Okay. Uh-oh. I know that look. It's Christian. He wants to see me. Of course he does. - Nobody move. - Oh, oh, oh, my God. - Not one reach. - Okay. I said, nobody move! Put the phone down! - Phone, lady! - Okay. Okay. Okay, okay. What do you want? - You. Get in the car now. - No. - No, no. - I said now! - Like hell she will! - Move it, lady. You're taking her, you're taking me. Addison, stop. Okay, listen. I will go with you, but please just don't hurt anyone. - Good. Move. - Hey! All right, now... Oh, Jesus. - Oh, my God. - I'm gonna call for help. - Are you okay? You're okay? - Yeah. Yeah. - That's all. - Okay, thank you. Did they find the guy? No. They're still looking for him. How the hell did he get on the backlot? Richard was outside the gate, distracted on his phone. The kid held him up at gunpoint. He's giving his statement now. - Well, Richard's fired. - What about us? We gave our statement. We're free to go. Oh, but, Ozzie, they wanna speak to you for a minute. All right. Um, you gonna be okay, sweetie? Yeah, I'm fine, thank you. Can anybody watch her tonight? Yeah. There'll be a patrol car at your house all night. I'm gonna call you first thing in the morning. - Stay safe. - Thanks. Thank you. And I'll stay with you tonight, too. Okay. Thank you. Come on, I'll drive you home. Hey. Eden. Hi. - Jackson. Are you okay? - I'm fine. Are you okay? I am so sorry about that. Don't be sorry. You saved my life. You saved all our lives. Thank you. Yes, we really appreciate you stepping in to help, but we have to go now. Yes, ma'am, understood. Just my card, in case you ever want some security detail or anything, I have four years of extensive training. - Okay, we appreciate that. - All right. - Thank you. - Goodnight. I guess word is out about the attack. Yeah. It's been all over the news since about 6 a.m. Bet your publicist is having a field day. Yeah. And Christian is totally freaked out. He started texting me at 2 a.m. when he found out. - Hm. - Barely got any sleep. Well, here. Perfect blend of green goodies is the pick-up you need. Thanks. And thanks for staying last night. I'm so sorry. Why are you sorry? Because he was after me, and you could've gotten hurt because of me. Eden, stop. You always do that. You, you blame yourself for things other people do that have nothing to do with you. It just doesn't seem fair. Well, life's not fair. All you can do is be true to yourself and your art. Yes, people listen to you, and, yes, that comes with a ton of responsibility. But you know, what people choose to do, that doesn't define you. I just feel guilty. You and Colette put your lives on the line for me. I hate that. Look, I have been with you since you were literally unknown. And I'll continue to be here for your last Vegas revue. You've, seriously, you've given me a life and a career. And for that, I can never repay you. You're the best. You know, you could skip going into the studio today. What if we were to just stay here and go for a dip in the pool? Well, that sounds like an excellent plan. I'm gonna go get us bikinis. Okay. Christian. Jeez! I used my old key. If I had a knife, you'd be shanked. Why didn't you use the doorbell? Well, you weren't responding to my texts, and I wasn't sure if you'd answer the door. So, well, here I am. Are you okay? They still haven't found him? No, Colette says the cops think he's probably long gone by now. But they are gonna send someone to watch the gate for the time being. Well, then I'm staying. Christian, you don't need to stay here. I want to. Look, I'm not ready for you to stay over again yet. Ede, can't we just move on already? Christian, you can't just waltz back in here because you suddenly have time. Two months ago you were off playing gigs God knows where. I know I wasn't always there when you needed me, but you have to admit, you pushed me away, too. Every time that I stayed over, you went right back to Ms. Independent with, "Oh, I think you should go home now." I'm sorry. And I do, I want us to grow. But I just don't have the time right now. Ede, I'm not Lee, and I'm not going anywhere. And I know you're capable of taking care of yourself, but I just wanna be in your life. I will sleep on the couch if you want. Addison is staying here for now. I will be fine. Will you at least have dinner with me? Friday night. Please? I will think about it. Okay. Are you gonna go out to dinner with Christian or not? No, I don't know if I'm ready to. If you wait till you're ready, it's never gonna happen. - Oh! Crap. Sorry! - Oh! Oh. It's all good. I'll get it. Sorry. - Eden? - Are you all right? I just found bags and a bottle back there, like someone's been squatting in the garden. Maybe your gardener was having lunch back there? No, no, Jerry's on vacation, and he swept up the garden before he left. Okay, well, should we call the cops? Addison, don't be so dramatic. - What? - I mean, yeah, what would I say? "Hey, stalker left some trash back here. Can you dust these for prints?" - Yeah. - Eden. You are way too casual about your safety. I... I know you're trying to salvage as much of a normal life as possible, but you need better protection than just a gate and a good security system. Okay, I, I can't stay every night, you know? Well, I'll stay. Okay, you're right, I'll call that security guard. - See if he's available. - Oh, yeah. Maybe he can case the place for a while, at least until we know that lunatic is gone. - That guy was so sweet. - Well, and so hot. Okay. I'll give Colette a call, maybe she can interview him. I think I still have his card somewhere. I think that is, that is a great plan. - Yeah. - Makes me feel better. Wow. Hey. Nice Tuney. Oh, yeah. You can pick it up if you want. Uh, no. Priceless goods. Thank you, though. Hey, you want a lemonade or a tea? Uh, lemonade sounds great. Please, have a seat, Mr. Reed. Okay, so, we did your background check and you're clean, your references are pristine. So why don't you tell me what's not on your record, so I don't have to find out from some private source? Of course. Um, uh, what? Like, what are you looking for? Like, criminal activity? Like, anything you deem worthy of noting before I consider hiring you to protect an international superstar. Sure. So I got busted buying booze when I was 19 with a friend. It was his idea, not mine, I assure you. Um, I mean, it's really all I can think of. No, parking tickets. I get a lot of parking tickets. The meters in my neighborhood are... Working on it. Why did you decide to get into private security detail? Oh, I actually wanted to do stunts in the movies, but I was taking care of my little sister when she was in high school, and so I had to get a job and I started bouncing at a club in San Diego. I know, um, that whole time, though, I was taking defensive-training classes, combat classes to keep one foot in that, in that stunt world. But then the security detail thing just took off and, um... here I am. Well... I have been managing Ms. Chase since she was barely an adult. Mm. Mm-hmm. And since she's family to me, I need you to understand something. She's not just any client. You do realize who Eden Chase is? Yes, ma'am. Uh... I think she's an ordinary person who doesn't really understand how extraordinary she is. I think that she probably still finds it pretty weird when people treat her differently, because all she wants is to be normal. It's funny 'cause I think that's what makes her so relatable to her fans and, I mean, frankly why so many people love her. - Hi. Thank you. - You're welcome. That's great. Okay. So there's just one problem. Eden Chase is not normal. And your idyllic sentiments, while sweet, are naive and could get her killed. Look, if you wanna know if I would kill for Ms. Chase... the answer is yes. Welcome to the team. Thank you. Okay, you are not to step foot upstairs unless Ms. Chase asks you to, understood? Ms. Chase calls the shots. She has me on speed dial. I'm less than five minutes away. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. This is great. My pleasure. There are towels on the top shelf of the cabinet in the laundry room, if you need anything else, just give me a shout. Thank you. You, too. Hey, Eden. You're safe with me. I promise. I prefer mine with salt. Funny. So do I. Have at it. Thank you. You always eat in the kitchen? Dining room is too big for one. Makes sense. Better views, though. Like the one from that balcony. Right. I'm gonna go get dressed for this studio meet. That's great. I'll drive you. Uh, actually, Eden, I wanted to mention. I carry a firearm. I didn't know how you feel about that. I do keep it concealed. But it's really comes down to how you feel. It's fine. Uh, just keep it locked up while you're here. And don't use the wild parakeets as target practice. Can do. Lock it down. Protect the parakeets. - How is he doing? - He seems great. - He's really down to earth. - Great. Okay, I think Ozzie wants to ask about Lee's new film. I know, you don't wanna do it, but I think we should at least consider. He did just produce your best album. Okay. Eden, babe. How are you feeling, huh? I'm doing much better, thank you. Okay, that's amazing. Okay, hey, hey, have a seat. Here, have water. There you go. So, ready to lay down a classic eight-track renewed and remixed for Lee's big new film? Um, as you recall, we already passed on the opportunity to provide a track for Eden's ex's new film. But happy to hear you out, so, please... Okay, so the execs called, they just want what's best for the film. Now, we sent you the premise that the studio sent us, and we know Reborn is perfect for a remix. It-it never got the traction that it deserved when it was first released, and it's still one of the best tracks on our first album. Right, but doesn't it feel like they just want it for some sort of publicity stunt? Who cares? You don't have to go to the premiere. You don't have to see Lee, y-you don't even have to look at the damn movie at all if you don't want to. You just lay down some fresh tracks, and then ka-ching, we all make a ton of money. It's that simple. Hey, it'll be like the rebirthing of Reborn. Okay, we... Ozzie, we... Oh, no, it's not that simple. The song was controversial at the time. It still is. Do we even know if the label's gonna say yes to this? Mm-hmm, because the label already said yes to me. Craig's my boy. We were just having dinner last week. Look, we just wanna do this gnarly-ass remix, and then we'll crush this whole thing. Excuse me. Can I help you? Um... - I-I'll just stand here. - Oh, okay. No! Who the hell are you? What're you doing in my meeting? This is Eden's new security detail. They still haven't caught the guy, she needs somebody around full-time to keep her safe. Okay, but still, why do you think you have the right to walk into my meeting? Go. Actually, his name is Jackson, and I would like for him to stay. So, Jackson, please, you can stay. Look, Ozzie, it's not that I don't appreciate the offer. I just think it's kinda weird to record a song for a movie my ex is starring in, you know? Can I just have a little bit longer to think about it? Well, if by little bit you mean Friday, because we have to record this by Monday. Otherwise I've got to get a bad replacement because I've already made a commitment to these bozos to help them get a song now. Okay, fine. You know, thank you, Ozzie. We appreciate you and everything you've done for us. We're gonna talk about it and we'll let you know. Well, by the way, just so you know, in my 26 years in business, nobody's ever made me go to my second choice. Hope you're not the first. Thank you, Ozzie. We'll let you know. Mm. Okay. Take a day or two and let me know. - I'll support you either way. - Thanks, Colette. So where to next? You know, I'd like to stop by that little market in Brentwood? I'm in the mood to make tacos. You can go to a grocery store without being mauled by fans? No, but you can. Right. You wanna chop up some of that jalapeno, throw it in here? You want some in your meat? I'm from Texas. I can take the heat. Ah, I see. Where the, uh, Taco Tuesday was originated, I'm guessing? Sadly, I think that was in Jersey, but we did perfect the TT in Texas. Right. - Okay, is that enough? - Oh, yeah. Beautiful. Okay, all the fixings are good to go. I don't know about you, but I need another margarita. So long as the boss is okay with her bodyguard drinking on the job. It's better than the alternative. Me drinking alone. Dinner's ready! Let's eat. Mm. Taco Tuesday, Texans for the win. Thank you, now, I gotta say, this is admittedly my first time having dinner with a client, so it's a little strange to me. Maybe you've never had a client like me. I am a Tennessee girl, we're known to be very nice like you Texan folk. So, uh, makes me a little curious. You're obviously okay with me stealing a grapefruit, occasionally eating in your presence. But we haven't talked any house rules yet. I just wanna make sure I'm not overstepping while I'm here. Hm, I've never had anyone live here before except for friends in and out. But I'm pretty easygoing. What do you wanna know? Well, I mean, I did see that gym downstairs. Ah, yes. I'm normally down there around 8:00 every morning, unless I go to a spin class. You're welcome to use it as long as you wipe everything down. Sounds great. Thank you. You can use the pool, watch the TV, use the computer, whatever. Really? That's amazing. Thank you. Okay, anything you don't want me to do? I am a little weird about my laundry. So if you ever notice that I've left clothes in the dryer, just remind me. I really don't like people touching my clothes. - Yeah. - Not even the maids. Sure. Hey. Hands off the laundry. Copy that. Can do. So you living alone. Where are your parents? You mean you don't already know? What? Wow, sorry, that was super arrogant assuming that everyone knows about my personal life. No, hey, don't get me wrong. I mean, who doesn't know the lyrics to Soul Reborn? You know, I think my sister actually played that song every day for a year. Well, it's actually just called Reborn. But thank you. That's very sweet. I mean, the truth is, I don't follow the fluff. I don't know anything about your personal life aside from you dating Lee Vance and then that, um, musician Colin, uh... Christian. Christian Cruz. That's it. I was way off. Anyway, yes, I am close to my parents. They retired in Mexico, so these days if I wanna see them other than on FaceTime, I have to go down to them. They are very attached to their oceanfront view. Which I bet you bought for them, didn't you? I mean, yes, they had me later in life when they were kinda set in their ways. So I figured getting them out of my business was a wise investment. Sure. These days I really just miss them. All right. I think you need another one. My turn. Are you not having another one, too? No. No, just water for me. I still got to do my perimeter check. - Here you go. Yeah. - Thank you. Okay. So what about your family, then? My family? Yeah, wow. Uh, well, let's see here. My mom retired to her grave when I was 26 years old. Yeah, sure wish it was Mexico. But I mean, the view's better from the sky anyway, right? - Jackson, I'm so sorry. - No. No, don't be. She was sick. My dad, I... Yeah, who the hell knows where he is. We stopped speaking to him shortly after my mom had my sister. Your sister, are you close to her? Yes. Yes, we were close. Yeah, she was my, uh, she was my little everything. She took her own life five years ago when she was 19. I wasn't a good kid growing up. I got in trouble a lot, pissed my dad off a lot. He was strict, military strict, you know? Around ten, my mom has my baby sister, and it wasn't planned, and dad wasn't thrilled, so he took off back to Texas. Yeah. You know, growing up, all Tess wanted was a relationship with my dad, but he just wouldn't give it to her, wouldn't do it. So naturally she relied on me and my mom for everything. This time my mom gets sick. Tess is 14 years old, she meets this kid, this prick kid named Mike Miracle. Yeah. That was his real name. Little son of a bitch. My mom dies, Tess doesn't really ever recover from that. And at that same time, this kid, he dumps her, he breaks up with her for another girl, and that, that was it. Mm, oh... - I'm sorry. - No. No, thank you. Means a lot. You know what Tess never stopped loving? Eden Chase. Yeah, it's true. She played your music so much. Oh, my God! Oh, she had to be your biggest fan. You know, along the way, I think, uh, maybe, kinda sort of made me a fan, too. Well, considering that you saved my life, your Taco Tuesday skills, margarita-mixing skills, I'm a fan, too. Thank you. And thanks for hearing me out. I don't talk about Tess very much. And, uh, yeah, I don't know, I just felt safe sharing that with you. Hope I didn't cross any lines. I think you just blurred them... which in this case is okay. - Hey. - Hi. Hi. Um... Yeah, eight o'clock's your time in the gym, isn't it? - It's okay. - I am so sorry. - Let me get out of your way. - Oh. No, it's fine. I'm going to a dance class in Brentwood. Okay. Let me get dressed and I'll take you. No, no, don't worry about it. They have security. It's a private gym. Addison's coming to pick me up. We should be totally safe. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. See you in a few. So, how's the new bodyguard? - What's his name again? - Jackson. And, yeah, he's a really nice guy. It's been kinda weird having him there, but safe, too. So that's it? He just moved in and you have a hot roomie now? I guess. It's been nice having him there. We even had dinner together last night. - Mm. - Talking to him is refreshing. In what way? I don't know. He's just honest. He's got this kind of Southern charm. And not talking about the industry all night was really nice. Hm. Okay. Okay, what was that? I-I don't know. It seems like you like him. What? No. He's a literal employee. - That would be a disaster. - Okay. Anyway, I'm having dinner with Christian now on Friday. - Oh, really? You caved? - Mm. Well, it's about time. You so need to get laid. Hi, I'm meeting Christian Cruz. Oh. Looks like you have a stalker fan club over there. Ah. You might have to remove them forcibly. They look dangerous. - Hey. - Eden. Hey. Christian, this is Jackson, my personal security detail. Your bodyguard? Wow. Sounds official. - Nice to meet you, Jack. - Nice to meet you, Chris. Um, my name is Christian. Ah, my name's Jackson. Okay. Jackson, if you wanna, I don't know, wait at the bar? You can order what you want and we'll put it on our bill. Sounds great. Thank you. You guys have a great dinner. Just holler if you need me. The music video? How long do you guys have of filming? - Three days in Maui. - Maui, huh? We were supposed to go there together, as I recall. We were. You just never took me. Will you invite me now? I don't know. I'll think about it. But if I remember correctly, you don't really enjoy being around my work events. Ouch. I told you I was sorry for missing your Grammy party. Quite a few times, if I remember correctly. You did. I just never forgave you. So tell me about this new security detail, Jack. Jackson. He's a really nice guy. He's staying in the east wing while they're trying to find the guy who attacked me on the backlot. - I feel safer with him there. - He's staying inside your house? In the east wing. How do you feel you can trust him? And since when do you trust anyone? Since he saved my life that night. I need someone who can be there for me all the time, not just when it works for his schedule. I thought we talked about this. I thought we were starting over now. I'm sorry. Cute seeing you kind of jealous, though. Jealous? Of a bodyguard? - Don't think so. - It's amazing. The best part is she's an even better person. Crazy. Hey, guys. - How was dinner? - It was lovely. Excuse me, can we close his tab? It's the least I can do for you for driving her here and all. I see you made some new friends. Yes, thanks to you. Kevin and Katey here are your biggest fans, apparently. They'd love a selfie if you don't mind. Of course. My pleasure. Hi. That considered safe, man? Letting her get so close to them? Kevin Jamison and Katey Yates. Already ran background checks on both while we were enjoying some overpriced calamari. See that? Two steps ahead. Have a great night. Maybe this is a mistake. Maybe we should call it a night. Sober up. It's fine, really. I'll go. Okay. Sorry. - Goodnight. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. All right. Here we go. - Wow. - Rise and shine. - Look at this. - What? "Who is Eden's sexy new security?" No. Hey, look at the bright side. Someone was able to pay their rent with that photo. - That's a good point. Cheers. - Oh. Cheers. Did you hear that? Mm-hmm. Probably your pool guy. Yeah, I saw him out back earlier today. - Okay. Thank God. - Yeah. So, a-admittedly, I have seen some footprints here... in the garden, when I first arrived. And I know you told me your gardener's out of town, right? You saw footprints outside and you didn't think to tell me? Yeah. You're right, I'm sorry. I-I just... I mean, you were busy. And this isn't an excuse, I wanted you to be... to stay focused. Do you think it's him? I honestly don't know. Can I ask you a question? Christian. Do you trust him? Yeah. We dated for six months. Why? It's just people in this business can be crazy sometimes. I've seen it time and time again. People change. Okay. Show me some of your moves. I'm sorry, my moves? - Self-defense. - Really? It's okay. It's okay. What's next? Yeah. Tapping, okay? Yeah. No. - Easy enough? - Okay. It's not easy if you don't know what the other person's capable of... or... if they have a better weapon. Okay. That's good. What's next? Well, you could either find their weak spot... It's okay. Or... just wait for me to save you. Ah, let's do the bridge one more time. You can give me something better. That was scratchy. I-I-I need velvet. Can you believe this song was on her first album? It really is a rebirth. I actually did know that. All right, one more time. And this time coo, don't kaw. Her voice is off. Can't you tell? Yeah. Well... All right, I gotta go. Okay, bye. Okay, I think I've got something for the overlay tracks, but I need you to come back on Friday and re-record. Seriously? She sounded great. She always sounds great. That was nowhere near Eden-Chase great. What have you been doing anyway? I mean, never heard your texture so sloppy. Well, maybe your ears are off today. Look, I'm sorry, Ozzie. I haven't been sleeping well. - Maybe it's... - Oh, that's it. Oh, no. Or maybe, maybe it's because you had your boy toy over all weekend? What? Y-you didn't think that I knew you were at the restaurant getting all hot and heavy with Cruz when you knew you had to be here today to record? We went to dinner the other night. I don't care what you had. I just need you here Friday, vocals ready to rock. That means you've got to be a very good little girl this week. Fine. She gets it, okay? Are we good? Oh, no complaints. Some of your best work comes from your break-ups. I just need you here full-on Friday, all right? Okay, look, I'm not your good little girl. Put your hand past my waist again, and we're done. Okay, um... Friday, be reborn. You all right? Anything I can do for you before I make my rounds? No, I think I'm just gonna go send some emails and go to bed early. Hey, Eden. Does he always pull that inappropriate stuff with you? Yeah. He's just done so much for me over the years, it's hard to know when to tell him to back off. Guess I just had enough tonight. Well, good for you. You know your worth. Well, I don't know who's paying for it, but it's sure as hell not gonna be me. Don't we have insurance for that? Oh, uh-huh. Well, if you'd like some job insurance, go find some! Colette, hey. What's up? Do they know who it could have been? They know nothing, except that it was a homicide. How do they know? They didn't take anything, but they did find a star bandana at the scene. It was the same one that the guy was wearing... the night that we were attacked. It was his murder weapon. But why would they kill Ozzie if they're really after me? Sometimes stalkers do this sort of thing. They close in on the world around their victim. They target their friends, their colleagues, their entire way of life. Does that mean we're all in danger? Not if we catch this guy first. Eden, are you okay? Just so unreal. Super unreal. Yeah, so unreal, I think I need a drink. Same. Nah. I'm good. Still on the clock. I'm really sorry about the other night. I'm patient. I can wait. I really don't like the way that guy watches you, though. That's literally his job, Christian. Five, six, seven, cross it out, go. Stomp. Five, six, seven, go. One, two, three, four, fix, six, turn it out, boom! - Whoo! - Yes! It's fine. Hey. Are we watering the gardens now? Uh, you know, I think Eden and the others are up in the den, if you're looking for 'em. What are you doing, anyway? You do realize there's an entire sprinkler system dedicated to this. Is that blood? It is. I think a coyote got in here and caught a parakeet. It's too bad. I really like the way they sing. Okay. Seven, eight, one. Oh, my God. That looked so great to me. I think you ladies are done. I agree. I-I think we're done. Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay. Okay, okay. So can we just remember to get into the studio before our fittings by Friday? And just keep in mind that once you're sewn in, it can't be undone. So, Dara, let's hold off on the fatty Hawaiian food till after the shoot, okay? Sure. I'm gonna order us some yummy, semi-healthy takeout. Okay, so are we going back into the studio to re-record on Friday? They sent the remix. It sounds great. There's absolutely no reason to go back in. Ozzie is... was wrong. - Okay, great. - And actually... I'm gonna be in San Francisco this weekend, so sadly I'm gonna miss the festivities. Festivities? - Mm. - Go on. Tell her. So don't be mad. We decided a little album preview party would be fun. And plus, your friends would be super excited to hear that remix. Seriously? An album-release party? - Where? - Here. Next Friday. Just for you. And you don't have to do a damn thing. We've, we've got it all covered. - What? - Kurt worked it out. Look, I said nothing big, just an intimate garden party, fab food truck, couple of dozen guests. Look, you need this. And it'll be good for you before we go to Maui, because once the album drops and we go out on tour, it'll be all work, no play. Why do I feel like there's a catch? Just one performance of your Reborn remix, you know, to get the buzz going on your social. Look, PR said it'll be good for us and the album, and the... Yeah, hang on, you're suggesting having a party here, after everything that's happened? There'll be extra security at the gate. There'll be a list of names at the door, and if you're not on the list, you don't get in. And what about anywhere else on the property? That's why I hired you, unless you don't think you can handle it, in which case we need to bring somebody else in for the job. All right! Okay, I have a ton of work to do before I go. I'll be back on Sunday. Okay? - You'll be all right till then? - I think so. - Thanks, Colette. - Okay. - Have fun. - You, too. - I got it. Yeah. - Thank you. I know this was all your idea. You know she's right. You deserve this. Hey. You good? Isn't it weird to have a party after, you know, Ozzie? Oh, Ozzie was the poster child for the show must go on. Right? I, I honestly think he would have wanted you to have this party. Have it in his, have it in his honor. Maybe I'll dedicate Finally Free to him. I think that is a wonderful idea. - To Ozzie. Cheers. - Mm-hmm. Cute. There he is. I was looking for you. - How's it going? - Good. You guys get finished up? Mm-hmm, I was about to take off, unless you wanna show me your east wing. - I'm flattered. - Mm. I'm kind of still on the clock here. Plus, Colette's pretty strict. No guests. Well, lucky for you, I'm not a guest. I've slept over many times, just not that end of the house. Sorry. Reactionary response. Like I said, I'm flattered. No, thanks. Hey, what's wrong with you? Nothing. Let's just go, please. Okay. Sparkling wine and ice cream pairing, huh? Don't judge me. It's been that kind of day. Besides, this is light bubbly and I'm only gonna have, like, two bites of this. Yeah, I'm never gonna judge someone for eating peanut butter and pretzel ice cream, are you kidding me? Mm. You want some Prosecco? Christian was too busy. You know I hate drinking alone. You know, sadly, I draw the line at the bubbly. - More of a whisky guy myself. - Whisky, huh? We have that, too. You mind me asking what happened with you and Christian? Thought you guys broke up. I mean, that's what the tabloid said. We did break up. It's like we were both just so busy. Lee and I were both really busy, but it was like we couldn't stay away from each other. Like, we had this unhealthy addiction to each other. Yeah, maybe it says you guys can't open up to each other, you know, for real, 'cause of your past relationships. Or maybe you're not really in love. Hard to say. Women throw themselves at Christian all the time, just like they did with Lee, but Lee cheated on me all the time even when we lived together, so... You think Christian's a cheater? No, I don't. I think he's like me. Hard shell. But you're right. It is hard for me to open up to him. Well, you haven't had a hard time opening up to me. It's funny. What's that say? I don't know, just something about you. You're easy to talk to. Well, I did unload my life story on you, too, so... But that was the tequila. - Mm. - Told ya. Well, what does whisky do to you? Mm... That's a gamble. You know, ahem... I think it's what you said the day we hired you. You said that I'm probably surprised when people treat me different 'cause I'm famous, 'cause I just wanna be treated like a normal person. You're right. Well, hate to say this, but I lied that day... Yeah. I also said you were extraordinary. But what I didn't say was that it's not because of your beauty... or your voice... but because you're you. Was that the whisky? Nah. Wait, wait, wait. - What? - I think we... I have had too much to drink. Eden, admit it. There's something between us. All right? We both know it. Come on. Yeah, I know, I just... I have to go to bed. Eden. Hey. Hey! Eden, can we talk about this for one minute? Please? Hey. Hey! I just want to go to sleep, okay? - Fine, you can, after we talk. - There's nothing to talk about. I'm your boss, you're my bodyguard. It was a mistake. No, that's not all we are to each other, and you know it. Can we please talk about this after we've both sobered up? - I'm perfectly sober right now. - Yeah, well, I'm not! And I need to go to sleep. Hey. You know I'm only here to protect you, right? Yeah. Thank you. So, wait, he got physical with you? No, he didn't hurt me. He ju... It was scary, the look in his eyes. Okay, but that's kind of his job, right, like, to look intimidating or whatever? I mean, I guess. Do you think it may be bothered you because you sort of wanted it? He's my employee, Addison. He's supposed to protect me from the bad guys. I can't have him here in the position to become the bad guy. Right, right. Okay, well, what do you want to do? Do you want me to come over? Would you? I mean, I'm sure it's fine. I just wanna go to the studio without him, talk to Colette, see what she has to say about it. Okay, fine. I'll be there soon. Okay, thanks. - Good morning. - Hey. Thank you for the grapefruit and coffee. It was really sweet. And the apology? I'm sorry again. I didn't mean to make you upset last night. - I shouldn't have. - Jackson, it's fine. I was drunk, I let my emotions over Ozzie and Christian and the album get the best of me. That's all. So where are we headed to today? Actually, I'm just going into the studio for a little bit, it shouldn't take long. I thought Colette said you didn't have to re-record the track. Oh, yeah, she just has some Maui travel stuff she wants me to sign before she leaves tomorrow. Great. I'm gonna go get my keys. Actually, um, Addison is swinging by to pick me up. And there's security at the studio, so we should be fine. - You don't want me to come? - No-no, it's not that. I just have these guys coming with the sound equipment. I thought maybe you could let them in. Of course. Yeah. Whatever you need. - Great. - All right. Oh, I'm just gonna go over there and fire him immediately. Okay, no, Colette, I don't want this to get messy. He just developed feelings is all. I think we should go easy on him. Do you have feelings for him, too? No, I don't. Okay, not like the feelings I have for Christian. So why do you care if I fire him? Because I do care about him. Maybe it's just not a good idea for him to live in the house. Okay, so I'll tell him to collect his crap and leave the premises immediately. We can get you new onsite security. Right before the party? And-and you leave tomorrow? That creep is still out there. I just... I don't think it's the best idea. Eden, do you think this just could wait? For what? What if he knocks down her door next time, huh? You know, I... Maybe I'm just gonna cancel my trip. No, no, Colette, you and Richard just worked things out. You should go. I'll be fine. And I do feel safer with him there knowing that guy's out there. Yes, and look, I will be right by your side the entire weekend. I don't think Jackson's gonna try anything with me there. Okay. Fine. But just keep me updated regularly, okay? And when I get back, Mr. Reed is off the property for good. Okay. - Thanks, Colette. - Okay. - Safe travels. - Okay. You guys don't have too much fun tomorrow, okay? We'll try. - Here, mate. - Thanks, mate. - Oh. Hey, guys. - Hello. - Hey, you're back. - Wow! You brought out the arch. It really is a special occasion. Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing this. You are the best assistant a girl could ask for. Anything for you, my pop princess. Oh, I even sent don't-save-the-date to your enemies, so they're gonna know we're gonna be having fun without them. Manana. Oh, yeah. And I'll be over tomorrow at 4 p.m. sharp to fix that face. Oh, yes, thank you. - Hey, has anybody seen Jackson? - Oh, yeah, he was here earlier. He said he didn't have anything nice to wear for the party, so he had to go to Encino and get his bestest blazer. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. - Well, here, let us help you. - Yeah. - Sure. - Thanks. Jimmy? Is that you? Hello? Hello? Jimmy, this isn't funny. No matter how many times you ask, I'm still not going out with you. Hello? Boo! H-h-help! Jackson, you're back. Did you get your suit? - Hey, Addison. - Hey, Jackson. Hope you don't mind I'm crashing the house for this weekend's festivities. Ah, not my house. - More the merrier, right? - Absolutely. Um, you look stunning. Thank you. - Are you okay? - It's Colette. She's not answering my calls or texts. It's just weird. Maybe she's still on the plane to San Fran. What time is her flight? Okay, yeah. Maybe it's just that. Maybe. Now look, you need to stop your worrying. Okay? Tonight is your night to shine. Yeah? See? - It's you, baby. It's you! - Okay. - She looks so good. - So good. Is that Lee who just walked in? You gotta be kidding me. What is he doing here? More importantly, who invited him? It wasn't me. I swear. That was amazing! So hot! - My goddess. - Mm. Thanks, guys. - Look at this, guys. - Nice remix, Ede. Lee. What are you doing here? I was invited, by Colette, of course. She didn't tell you? Colette... What makes you think you would be welcome? No, you know what, you need to leave because you're not welcome here, no matter what that text says. Nice to see you, too, Addison. Gang's all here, huh? Lee, I think there's been some sort of misunderstanding. - No, I can read texts just fine. - Yeah? Well, how about I send you a text to remind you that you cheated on her and treated her like crap for years? - Why would she want you here? - Christian, it's fine. No, no, no. Cruz has clearly got a lot to say. But why don't you go write a crappy little song about it and let Eden speak for herself? Let's just go out front and have a private discussion, huh? - You guys... - Get your hands off me. I came to support Eden and I was invited. You need to leave! Hey. Lee, right? Eden, let, let's get you out of here. I'm fine. Hey, you need to tell everybody to leave, okay? Okay, okay. Yeah. Ahem. All right, everyone! Uh, we're gonna call it a little bit early tonight. But thank you, everyone, for coming out this evening and supporting Eden. So, uh, buenas noches. Bye now. Hell, man, where are you taking me? I'll find my car just fine, thanks. Whoa. Whoa! - Thanks. - You're welcome. - You all right? - I'm fine. I wish I'd gotten in a right hook before Jack stepped in. I mean, where was he? What took him so long? - I have no idea. - You know what? You could totally write a hit song about this. - Yeah. - I might do that. Okay, okay. We're leaving. Mm, mm. All right. Mm. Mwah. Mwah. Thank you for coming. Bye. - Love you. - Love you. Bye, mama. Mm! Hey. At least you got to perform your song for everyone and look really great while doing it. - Thank you. - All right, bye, mama. You were great. You look great. - Thank you. - You look great. My goddess. - Thanks. - Hey, take care of him. - Get home safe. - All right. All right. I'm gonna take a shower. I think that's a good idea. - Well, that was a bust. - Yeah. What do you think happened to Jackson and Lee anyways? I don't know. Maybe Jackson killed him. Hm. My God, what? Find me a boyfriend. Let's get tequila. So weird. I still haven't heard from Colette. And of all people, why would she invite Lee? Ede. There is, there is something that I have to tell you. It's about me and Lee. Back when I had just started working for you, and you and him were on the rocks... Wait. Did you hear that? - What was that? - I heard it before. I think it's coming from the storage room. We'll check up. What is that? I don't know. Oh, my God! No, no, no, please. Help me. Wasn't that the guy who attacked you? Yeah, I think so. It was the same outfit at least. Well, what was he doing in your storage room? I have no idea. We need to find Christian and call the police now. Wait. Where the hell is my phone? Mine's gone, too. Christian! Eden? Christian! Where is Jackson? "Tess?" The lyrics of your song really say it all, don't they? Reborn. You were heartbroken by Adam in the garden of Eden, so you ate from his poisoned apple, and then died so that you could be reborn. Only, you got the story wrong. Yeah. Sit. Sit, please. In the Bible it was Eve who ate the poisonous apple first. Eden, come on. But your stupid little song was like passing that poisonous apple to my sister. Your music poisoned her. It made her think it was the only way out, that she could be reborn, that the pain would just go away. Jackson, I didn't mean... Y-you didn't mean to make millions on a song that my sister used to kill herself? Huh. Okay. It's a pop song, Jackson. It's a song about female empowerment. If your sister didn't know the difference... No, no! You don't get to talk, Addison, because it's not all on Eden. No, you see, it's on Ozzie, that son of a bitch who produced it. It's on Colette who endorsed it, which, by the way, I will say I'm indebted to her because after I turned her head around backwards on her body, I used her cell phone to invite Lee, the ex who inspired the song, whatever. His body's chilling in your garden right now. - By the way, don't let me... - Jackson. - Please... - And then, one second, please. It's on you, sweet, sweet Addison, the BFF. See, you screwed Lee... behind her back and helped break her heart. Addison... But it is mostly on you, Eden. How dare you revamp and remix this despicable song? This track will never be re-released, not after the killings that are about to surround it. - Jackson. - No. Listen. Think about all the people I'm going to save... because I bet it will be someone's sister. Jackson, where's Christian? Please tell me you didn't hurt Christian. Oh. Mm, I'm just kidding. He's fine. I did a number on his skull. I'm sorry. We already called the police. Did you? Yes. With what phones? Oh! What did you think of Stu? Because he is your biggest fan. I met him on an Eden Chase fan site, and he is just... He's... He's crazy. But he was the perfect pawn for my perfect plan. You hired him to attack me? I would say I groomed him. You see, I let him sneak onto the lot where I took a job right after hearing that it was where you were gonna shoot your new music video. And then I just gave him the opportunity to have you to himself, but really, if I'm being honest, it was just so that I could save you. You know, earn your trust. Yeah, not very original, but... You'll never get away with this, you realize that? 'Cause even if we die, everyone knows you're here with us. Yes, Addison, good. That's why I was so grateful that Stu showed up again here, helped me get this job, and then, God bless him, he showed up again, and that's when I caught him. And I realized that if I just hung on to him, well, then he could be the fall guy for all the killings that are happening around here. You're sick. You need help. Come on, Eden, I thought you were listening! I'm the hero. Oh, my God, let me spell this out for you, okay? I see two villains in front of me. So... who is ready for the final chase? Run. Where are you going? Oh, my God! Okay! Sure. Let's get some fresh air. He's coming. Hide. Ede, it was before we were friends. Okay, I was dumb and insecure, and I really thought y'all were over. Addison, it's in the past. It doesn't matter. You've been there for me. You're my only true friend. Oh, my God, Ede. I think he heard us. Shh! Let's go. Come on, let's go. Go, go. Oh, come on. Like you didn't want him dead. Ow! Come here! - Come here. - No! No! No, no, no. Jackson, no, no, no. Addison, Addison. Addison, Addison! I really wouldn't do that if I were you. You know, I'm not responsible for what happened to your sister. All my life I have felt responsible for how fans respond to me. But I won't take responsibility anymore. I couldn't control the path that she chose, and you can't change it. Killing me won't change it. Maybe not. But I will feel so much better... knowing that my plan worked... that I did to you exactly what your music did to my sister. Made her feel comfortable... and safe. You know, I did learn a lot from you. You never know what a person is capable of... especially if they have a better weapon. Eden... Christian. What was that? Probably just the stalker that's tied up in the storage room. Okay. Well, for what it's worth, I really liked your remix. Yeah? Me, too. I'm so glad you're okay. We will be okay.
