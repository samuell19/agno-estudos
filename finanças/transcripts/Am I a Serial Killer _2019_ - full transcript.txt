I'm here at the San Marcos State Prison, where a last-minute appeal for a stay of execution of Annie Weaver has failed. Weaver was charged with the brutal double homicide of Frank and Lucy Miller eight years ago, a suburban couple who had been renting a room in Weaver's Ridgeside home. The weapon used to murder the couple earned Weaver the nickname "Weaver the Cleaver Killer." Weaver's trial took a dramatic turn when her own daughter, Natalie Weaver, then age 10, testified against her. Weaver is set to be executed one month from today, though her legal team maintains her innocence and vows... [clicks TV off] You don't have to do that. Do what? I make breakfast every morning. Turn off the TV just because it's about her. [Caroline] Well, you shouldn't listen to that stuff. [Natalie] It's fine. I'm used to it. You don't have to protect me. I'm not a child anymore.

But recent attacks in our community have mirrored the original crimes in ways that are undeniable to dismiss and have caused us to re-examine the old investigation. Upon re-examining the prior case, it was discovered that evidence potentially pointing to other suspects was concealed, was, in fact, destroyed. Due to this new information, Judge Oberman has overturned Annie Weaver's conviction and has set her free from prison, effective immediately. The investigation will be reopened. We have several persons of interest in the recent attacks and we will be pursuing all leads. Due to the ongoing nature of the investigation, there's little else I can comment on. Thank you. [piano music] [Natalie] We should tell them about Geoff, what I found, the knife. No, honey, then it's just gonna look like you're laying blame on someone else. And besides, we have no proof that he did anything anyway. [sighing] [tense music] I think you should stay home today. And just sit here, waiting for them to arrest me? No thanks.
