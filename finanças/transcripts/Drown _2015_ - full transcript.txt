[brooding music] [switch clicks] [soothing tone] [waves lapping quietly] - Do you ever think about the end of the world? I do. I imagine I'm one of the last people left. You know, a massive tsunami hits the east coast. Everyone dies. I survive. Little me, useless me. I know I can swim a little, save people a little, but I'm not that good at it. Many better. And let's not forget I let that chick die. I mean, what a cunt. What a useless fuckin' cunt. [waves crashing] [tires squeal] [suspension squeaks] Grab the other bottle.

Feelin' the reflected glory? - What's that? - Champs of this club. - Yeah. - Smithy. Len Smithy. - Five times. - Generations, mate. Me, my old man, and then some. Older than the Greeks.

Yeah, like eat shit ell Anyways... do you remember what the teachers used to do? - No. - They'd bring in sand. They'd cover up the vomit with sand. - So what's your point, Lenny? - Just keep digging, man. - Why? It's done. - It's gotta be deeper... Way deeper. [dramatic music] [cheers and applause] [energetic electronic music] - Come on, Lenny! - Come on, Lenny!

[cheers and applause] [engine whining] [metallic thud] [panting] [panting] [metallic scraping] [waves crashing] [metallic scraping] - [sighs] I have a large penis. It's not a blessing. Trust me, it's not a blessing. See, when I was 15, all us kids would get picked up and driven to the club of a weekend. One day, Mr. Smithy, Len's Dad, had to stop off at the servo to get smokes. And I was stuck in the back of the car with the other boys - Come on, Stuie, show us it! - No, I'm not fucking showing you. - One boy said, "Take off your clothes." - Show us your dick. - Fuck off. - Massive. B -"Come on, let's see it." They tried to strip me. Boys: Show us your dick! Show us your dick! Show us your dick! Show us your dick! Show us your dick! Show us your dick! Show us your dick! Show us-- - Then Mr. Smithy came back. "Oy, boys! What's going on?" he said. "Nothing, Dad." "Stuart?" "Nothing." But Len, Len wasn't happy about it at all - So it is true? - Fuck off. "Because if it's true, you might consider using your dick to your advantage," he said. - Yep. That's big. What can you do with it? - Not much. It's just a dick. - No, no, no. It's a weapon. It's a prop. It's comedy gold. - I can do this. I said as I bent down and took my penis in my mouth. - That's incredible. - He said. You do that in front of people, they won't hate you. They'll accept you. You can find popularity with your enormous dick. And you should have a nickname, a name that tells people that you're big and you're proud. - Meat. - Meat. Meat? "M-E-A-T." Meat. [laughs inaudibly] Perfect. That'll shut the old man up. So if you're ever feeling, you know, whatever, just-- Just remember he's not all that bad. Really, he's not all that bad. - Thanks very much. - Th, can I just grab a salad, please? - He'll have a pie and chips. Thanks, Mary. It's what we eat here, mate. So what's your deal, mate? - What do you mean? - Where you from? Why you here? Is there a god? All that other shit. You got a girl? - No. - You ever had one? - Right. Do you need any assistance? - Yeah, I can't see a price on this one. - I Think it's $7. - $7? - $3. [laughs] [sheets rustling] [smooching] - [moaning] [moaning] - See you later. - Yeah. - You must be hard as a diamond.

It's just a root. - Here you go, Phil. - It kinda flows-- In, like, one sort-- - That sounds really good. - Surf Lifesaver. - Oh, you're a lifesaver. - Lovely night for it, aye? - [laughing] - You're still the champ to me, mate.

[smacks] - Come on! Thanks for the support, boys! Fuck you! Haven't you got any fucking eyes? Haven't you got-- Look at my fucking shirt! - So I was talking to Mum yesterday, and she was like, "I can't believe you're dating a lifesaver. Does he make any money?" [laughs] We should get you something like that. That's shocking. It's a shocker. Well, that's exciting. See, look at that. Look how smart you look. I want you to be happy. It's just that I should probably choose it. - The buttons. - What are you-- See what I'm talking about? You just look so sophisticated. - I can't. - Okay, we'll get you a bigger size. - So there I was in the ocean, outside normal patrol. It was a weekday, and I was sporting these fancy new pair of swimmers-- made the region look good, if you know what I'm saying. I see this woman in the sea swimming towards the rip. I see her hair, right? And it's clinging toward the top of the water. I'm not sure what color it is. It's-- It's wet. All hair looks the same when it's wet. But she's just, like, swimmin' and swimmin' and swimmin', headin' out to sea. "Hey, where you goin'?" "Let go of me," she says. "What are you doing? The beach is that way." "I don't want to go to the beach," she says. "But if you keep goin' that way, you'll drown," I say. "I know," she says. And then she kisses me... soft and lovely on the mouth. I kiss her back. Not sure why I do. I just-- I kiss her back. [water sloshes] I just watch her swim and swim and swim... her legs kicking, body starting to sink a bit, and then she's gone. Sunk. Gone. And I think of my swimmers, my stupid new pair of swimmers. And I feel foolish for buyin' them, for wearin' them. I just feel... foolish. [bottle clanks distantly] - Maybe they went to Clovelly. [waves crashing] [metallic scraping] - [laughing] [gulping] [gurgling] - Hey, watch this. - [gurgling] It's quite musical, really, like a symphony, aye, Meat? - Don't go to symphonies much, Lenny. - So? - So it's hard for me to make comparisons if I don't go to symphonies, isn?t it? - Jesus. Use your imagination. You do have an imagination, don't ya? - Fuck you, Lenny. - [grunts] Like a fantasy. Like a wank, like a fantasy wank. - [chuckles] I do like a fantasy wank. I do like a fantasy wank. - Eyes closed. - In ya head. - Someone dares you to Kiss. Someone dares you to strip. - [laughs] - Trying to fight? "Mortal Kombat"? [laughs] [engine revs] - Someone is there to hold you. - Wow. Look at that. - You're gonna love this place. Horse riding, beautiful walks in the garden, random sex on that verandah. Oh, and they have this massage oil. So awesome. - Oh. Just one moment. 'I call you right back. I don't follow. - Ah, In the rooms, two bottles of essential oils. So cute. [smooch] - Well, perhaps that was the previous owners. They were rather creative. - Someone is dared to touch you. - I had a particular fondness for the sandalwood. - Uh, I don't really like sandalwood. - What do you prefer? Roman chamomile or sandalwood? - I don't really have an opinion. I mean I tried patchouli once, but... I it didn't agree with me. Made me feel sick. - To suck you. - Oh, my goodness. In all the madness, we just don't seem to have a double room for you. I think maybe you'd be happier at another sort of establishment. - And then you come. [dreamy rock music] [faint moaning] - In ya head. - And in real life. - [singing] I will Sway Think on it 20 times a day [foreboding music builds dramatically] - Hey, do you want me to go call them? - Nah. Nah, who needs them? Right, Champ? I want to be foolish. I want to be fucked-pants foolish. Whoo! [bright electronic music] [muttering indistinctly] - So I got this Aunt Alex, right.. - Not Aunt Alex the tennis player? - Nah, she's the one that was meant to be dead ten years ago. - Ah, she's cute. - Oh, you want to do my Aunt Alex? - Nah, man, I'm just saying she's cute. - 'Cause she's, like, 60, dude. - I don't want to do your Aunt Alex. - I mean, if you really want to do her, I'll set that shit up. - No, isn't-- isn't Alex a dude's name? - Which is ironic, 'cause this one day, Aunt Alex asks me, "Leonard, what did you have for breakfast this morning?" - And you said? - I said I had Weet-Bix. - And toast, mate. You always have toast. - True, brother. Weet-Bix and toast. - Yeah, and what'd she say? - She said, "What did you do with the Weet-Bix and toast?" I said, "I ate it. I ate the Weet-Bix and toast." And she said, And she said, "So you did the normal thing. You ate it." I said, "Yeah, I did the normal thing. I ate it." And then she stares at me. Like, not even blinking, not even breathin', I reckon. "So you didn't shove it up your ass. "You did the normal thing and didn't shove it up your ass." [electronic music] [engine revs] [crowd chattering indistinctly] [electronic music] - What am I? - You're a champion. - What do champions do? - They win! - So what am I gonna do? - You're gonna win! - Yeah, you're right, sweetheart.

Don't you think taking his clothes off is the best way to humiliate him? - I don't know. - You remember at school... - Busty blondes or big dicks? - Fuck off. Fuck off. - Having a bit of a commie. - Keep my ball. - You and Patterson are a bit chummy, aren't ya? - Michael. - Myers? - Patterson. - I hated him. - What did we do? - When I caught you two batting each other off. - Not that. Michael. Michael Patterson. Remember what we did to him?

You never think about it? - I don't want cheese shit under my... prepuce. - I didn't have a say about my circumcision, they just whipped off the top. - You still have an impressive dick, though. - Because I don't have a prepuce, I'm not protected against the...elements. - Like wind and rain... - The inside of dick togs, Len. All that rubbing must of had an effect. Maybe even sharpened I, like a pencil. So your penis is like a pencil? - I'm just saying I would've liked to been asked if wanted the sleeping bag or not. You know, there's the look of it, there's the fact that it's-- it's not as sensitive-- - And there's the fact that your penis looks like a pencil. - Fuck you!

No, mate. - Don't call me that. Fucking use that as a fucking thing... a fogbank to hide behind, 'cause I don't want that. I don't want to sit in the locker room at half-time sucking oranges with you and the others. Oh, mate, remember last night, mate? So fucking funny, mate. So fucking funny. Fucking great. But it's not fucking great, mate. It's bullshit, mate. It's not fucking men. Not like those footballers whose plane crashed in the Andes and had to eat each other to stay alive. I love those guys. They're mates. True mates. So if we ever go down in a plane, and we-- and we eat each other to stay alive, then you can call me a mate. Then and only then fucking then, amigo. Then and only then fucking then. - [sniffles] - Now, fill in the hole, Meat. [metallic scraping] - [grunts] [screams] [metallic scraping] [surf crashing] [surf crashing] [surf crashing loudly] What's that spade work? - I'm filling in the hole. - That's not filling in the hole. - I pick up the sand, and I push it into the hole. - You look like a girl. You don't have to pick up every granule of sand and place it delicately into the hole. You pick up wads, stacks of sand... [waves crashing] And put it into the hole.

Do you throw like a girl? - You're trying me. - You run like a girl? - Please, don't-- - Swim like a girl? - Shut up! - Because you hit like a girl. - [screams] [both smacking and grunting] [both grunting] [smacks, grunts] [both coughing and panting] - You... You touched me. - What? - You touched my penis. - I did not. - Do you want to touch it? Is that what you want? - Don't flatter yourself, boy. - Well, you went to grope. - It was an accident. - You want to touch it? Touch it. Come on, make me hard. Touch it. Feel it! - Piss off! - You liked it, though, didn't ya? And you fancy Phil. You come down here, get him drunk. You get him naked; bury him? All because you fucking like him. I'm not a fucking idiot, Len. You watch him in the showers. You watch him all the time. You go to his bunk, and you kiss him good night. Hose him into the urinals. And then-- then you cut him with the fragments of the mirror you made him smash with his own fuckin' head. - Wrong! You dumb fuck-up! - I'm not a fuck-up! - You're a Grade A fuck-up! - I'm not a fuck-up! - Yeah? Yeah? Then what are ya? - [stuttering} I don't know. I'm a man, I guess. - You're a man? No, no, no, no. I'm a man! - I'm more of a man than you are.

[faint splashing] [dreamy ambient music] - Come on. - [coughing] - Come on. [indistinct speech] Ah, fuck. - [grunting] [both grunting unintelligibly] [coughing] [both panting and coughing] [dreamy ambient music continues] [inaudible dialogue] [surf crashing] [mysterious ambient music] [ambient electronic music] [delicate dreamy music] [dreamy rock music] - [singing] I will.
