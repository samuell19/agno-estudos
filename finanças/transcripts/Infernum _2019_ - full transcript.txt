Babe....babe....babe! What? Wait here! Joe? Joe? Susan! Joe?! Susan! Joe! Tonight on KTTX, an alarming and unidentified sound heard throughout the Angelina National Forest over the weekend has rocked locals. We go now to Sandra Williams with more on the story. A sheepherder stationed 20 miles west of where Mr. Jacobson was last seen also reported hearing the chilling sound" Witnesses say they were unable to identify where the sound was coming from. I didn't know where it was coming from..from the ground, from the sky.. I couldn't tell. It was coming from everywhere. It was... I could feel it. The dramatic 911 phone call was released Tuesday morning. The caller, who has been identified, is breathless and talking about a terrifying sound that he can't get away from. WTNV's Jason Henderson is live in Kimberly, Nevada with new details on the tragedy that occurred over the weekend. A drifting portal to a hellish dimension. In the days before he vanished, the geologist reported hearing what he described as a haunting sound all around him." When the body was recovered, police noted that it appeared badly burned, but clothing remained intact. Mysterious and loud noises rattled windows and doors last night. From Learnsville all the way to the bay. The hunters were so rattled by what they were hearing that they abandoned their camp and fled down the mountain in the middle of the night. It's hard not to believe that something supernatural is at work here. Well I really like what you did with the eyes and the mouth, Camille. Very, very nice. You hollowed it out. Gives it a very haunting expression. Very good. I like the flow of the whole relief. You have really grown so much as an artist I'm very proud of you. Thank you. And I wouldn't change anything about it. Okay. Yeah. So um, tell me about your show. Um..Ok. Well, it's... it's called "Infernum" Mm Hm. And um.. it's... it's based on... it's based on the disappearance of my parents. I've also started interviewing people that have actually experienced the same thing. Incredible. And um-I'm gonna have that projected on a screen as well as um these on display. Basically I just want it to be a really immersive experience. Not only visually but audio and... it's exhausting I actually spent the entire night at an airport waiting for someone that I was supposed to interview who never showed up but I didn't want to leave because in case they did and it's just really consumed my life. Well I think you're doing great with your show, you have grown very much as an artist I'm very proud to you. Yeah. But uh, sorry now I really have to run. Oh! Right, right. And I see you at your show. Okay, Thank you so much, Roberta. All the best, best of luck, Camille. Take care. I see you soon. Yes. I appreciate you. Thank you! Hey James. Hey! Can you bring my notebook to uh the interview tonight? I need it for class. Yep... yes... okay... Okay see you then. Shit. Wow. I have never seen you look so embarrassed. Yes. Well that is because you are way too early. Early? Early for what? Camille. What? Oh. Ahhh Oh my gosh. Babe! Happy Anniversary. I'm a terrible girlfriend. Yes. You are. But, you are a wonderful sculptor. I know. Come on. I'm making dinner. I can't. I have that interview with James and that woman. Remember? I told you about this. You, you know this. You're serious? Yes. I told you about these interviews like a month ago. No, I remember the conversation, Camille. I just didn't think you would schedule one for tonight. Sorry. Look we literally talked about this a week ago you were gonna come over tonight I was gonna cook dinner for our anniversary. Look I'm sorry Ok? I messed up... again. It's just... my grad show is in like a week, I've been stressed out. I just... I'm sorry I forgot Okay. Look, it's fine, okay? I'm just disappointed. Believe it or not I want to help. Do you? Yes! I do! Alright? So just tell me what I can do. I actually just came by because I need to get James's notebook. James's notebook? Yes, James's notebook. He let me borrow it. It has all of his interview notes in it I needed it so I can photograph it for my project. I, I think it's inside. Perfect. Yeah let's... let's go get Jame's notebook. Hunter! What!? God, he's like a kid okay? He LARPs for Christ's sake. He's just helping me film these interviews he's. he's harmless. Camille I don't care okay what I care about is that he gets to spend our anniversary with my girlfriend. And I'm sorry about that! Okay I'm sorry. Look I spent the entire night in an airport. I haven't slept in fucking days I'm exhausted I have this project that I need to finish if you could just like maybe maybe understand that maybe like try to relax so that I can relax. Okay okay look I, I'm sorry. Okay? Can I? Is that? Yes. I'm sorry too. I love you. I love you. Look if it makes you feel any better why don't you come with me and then you can you can meet him? I don't really give a shit about meeting James, Camille. That's not the point. Okay how about this? How about.. how about you come over tonight? It shouldn't take too long we should be done like around ten. You can stay the night. Do this whole romantic anniversary dinner thing tomorrow. I do like romantic anniversary dinner things Okay. Yes? Yes. I will bring take out. I love takeout. I hate takeout. I know. It's not as good as your chacootery plate. Char, ch charcuterie. Char-charcuterie. There ya go. Charcuterie plate. Come inside. I'd just gone to bed and I was almost asleep. It was around midnight. I was in that fuzzy stage between.. between awake and asleep... and it was almost like it was a part of my dream and then Junie started barking and it just snapped me out of it like I sat straight up I didn't know what the hell was going on it was it was like a, a truck was out on the road. Like a big truck like um like a garbage truck or an 18-wheeler. Can you describe what it sounded like? I guess at the beginning it sounded like a- like a deep rumbling sound coming from everywhere. I didn't know where it was coming from.. from the from the ground from the sky I couldn't tell it was coming from everywhere. It was... I could feel it. Um, Junie, Juniper, my dog, was going absolutely crazy like I have never seen her act like that. So I went to pick her up... and she bit me. And she was howling and crying. It was awful. It was awful. Uh, Since I live so far up there, by the time the officer got there... it was all over. And... and what did they tell you about the sound? They made me feel like a crazy person... And um... and Junie never recovered. I'm so sorry. The vet said that she died of "exertional myopathy". It's when an animal is under extreme duress, usually when they've been captured by a predator. Their muscles break down and their organs can't process it fast enough and her heart couldn't take it. Jesus. It was so scary that no one believed me. I mean, I felt hopeless. I know exactly how you feel. The whole experience made me see everything differently. I have never felt safe after it. ...and. I realized something truly terrifying. And what's that? The evil that you can see is not as dangerous as the one you can't. Before this experience, had you ever heard of this phenomena? I'd never heard of it. My husband thought it was a plane crash I mean he's a retired Air Force pilot. He thought a jet engine had gone haywire and so we're looking for a plane crash and then we realized we couldn't tell where the sound was coming from. And then it stopped being mechanical... and started sounding like people... screaming. I mean it's really hard to explain, I... Was there anyone else there? Yes um, down the hill a little boy and his mother. The little boy... he was pointing at the trees and struggling to tell us something, struggling with English. And then we both heard him say. "the bad people" ...pointing at the trees. Douglas made us stay there and he went down to the base of the tree line and went in and then he came... a few seconds later came running out and made us run back up to the top of the ridge with him. He was shaken and pale and when I asked him, "what did you see in the trees?" He said "I don't know" So did your husband change his mind about thinking that the sound was a jet engine? Oh. Whatever he saw in those trees, he's blocked it. I mean he, he won't talk about it. He, he couldn't sleep without waking up drenched in sweat. We went to therapists and nothing helped until we were referred to recommended to Dr. Heights. She's a psychotherapist and a medium and she works for the FBI and Interpol. And how did she help? She said that what we had heard was a rift. A paranormal phenomena. She referenced that ancient literature has referred to the sound of hell... as "the wailing and gnashing of teeth." I mean it gives me chills because that's I mean that's exactly what it sounded like. It was the wailing and gnashing of teeth. Are you... are you embarrassed of me? Of course you're asleep. The wailing and gnashing of teeth. Hello everyone. First I want to thank you all for... Hello everyone. My name is Camille Williams and I'd like to start by thanking everyone for coming to my installation. The art in my show is based around a paranormal phenomena that I believe... Hello everyone my name is Camille Williams and I would like to start by thanking everyone for coming to my installation. The art in my show is based around a paranormal phenomenon that I believe is responsible for the disappearance of my parents. Hello? Hey! Have you seen the hearers page? What? The, the group page. It's, it's blowing up somebody's streaming it from Nevada. What, What time is it? It's 5:30. Just look at the page and call me back, okay? Look we have to go record this. We can be in Nevada by nine. Okay. Okay. Hello. Where are you? I'm home I'm sorry I was working on my opening statement and I fell asleep, but listen, Hunter, they're doing a live stream of it right now. Of what? What do you think? James thinks we should go and film it. Unbelievable. I know! I can't believe you've blown off our anniversary twice now Camille for this conspiracy bullshit! What are you talk-I'm not blowing off anything Look, I just fell asleep. You don't need to be doing this, alright? Your sculptures are already done. Is James there right now? No, why would James... why are you even talking like this? Because it's embarrassing! Oh it's embarrassing. How is it embarrassing? Look. I wasn't gonna tell you this, Camille but last week after you stopped by poker Adam asked me if you were a fucking flat-earther! Okay, that's embarrassing! Adam? Your friend Adam the one who thinks Stanley Kubrick fucking filmed the moon landing? Adam isn't the point. The point is what the hell am I supposed to tell my parents? That some spooky sound ate yours? There's an explanation for everything that happened to them, okay? You just don't know what it is. You are un-fuckin'-believable. I'm done. What!? Camille? Oh god, I'm sorry. I, I thought you were... it doesn't matter. Did you see the page? Yeah, I saw it. Let's go! We can be there before nine if we leave now. Yeah but it's, it's really dangerous. I don't want to like drive right up to it. I don't want to do that I just want to get... near it. Look, we should go to that town, Kimberly, and I don't know we can interview people or... I don't know I just think we should go. This could be a once-in-a-lifetime thing. I need this. O... Okay. Really!? Yeah, I just, I just don't wanna get too close. Okay um, we should leave now though and uh, pack warm because it's freezing cold there. Alright I'll be there in 30 minutes. Okay, 30 minutes. Alright. Yes. Hey are there any updates on the uh hearers page? No, it won't load. Okay I'm gonna go ahead and save the directions just in case cuz my phone keeps like going in and out. Cool. How far are we from Kimberly anyway? Umm forty-five minutes. Nice. Wow there's literally nothing out here. Yeah, reminds me of Colorado actually. Oh, great. What? Oh no, - Hey. - How's it going? - Good. - You headed over to Kimberly? - Uh Yeah. - You ain't makin' it tonight. Highway is shut down due to a landslide. It'll be shut down for the next forty-eight hours. If you head back down ten miles to about Lehman or so, there's a railroad museum there. You can catch the train, they're offering trips over. Okay HIGHWAY FLAGGER: But you better hurry up, they're leaving here in about ten minutes. Kimberly? Yes, please. Well that'll be uh, $75. I'm kidding, I'm kidding it's free until the highway opens. Oh. Oh. Can we ride in the caboose? Sure, if you want. It's all yours. Thank you. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Wow. Oh my God. Kimberly? This is amazing. Yeah. It's too bad it's not a steam engine. Diesel exhaust causes lung cancer. Oh. Wonderful, I didn't know that. Yeah, you should google it. Okay. Oh! You should start filming. Yes, good idea. James, you should look at this cute little stove. It's adorable. All right, you want to walk us through what's happening? Oh, uhh okay. What should I say? Why don't you start with why it looks like we're on the Orient Express. Right, um, okay so currently we are on a train headed for... "Ladies and gentlemen we are ready to depart for Kimberly, Nevada. please be aware, once again, that these train cars are museum cars and not commuter cars to treat them with respect. Our journey will be approximately an hour and a half. We will see you in Kimberly. Do you have any service? Uhh... No. Something tells me this train doesn't have Wi-Fi. Uh, yeah. My gosh, I can't believe we're doing this! I know. It's a shame it's dark outside. You can't see anything. Yeah. Dark and freezing. Oh, I have uh, extra gloves. Really? Yeah. Oh gosh. Oh my god your hands are freezing. I know, thank you so much. Yeah Hunter. What the hell... what are you doing here? What the hell are you doing here? You stopped answering my calls, Camille. You followed me here? I was worried about you driving. Oh, you were worried. About you driving, Camille. Nevada? Jesus. you kind of left that part out of the conversation. Oh my god this is unbelievable. Hey man would you mind just giving us a quick sec? Oh, yeah, yeah totally. Um, you're cool right? You're okay? Yeah. You actually don't have to go anywhere. Actually, yeah, James. Just a quick sec if you don't mind. Yeah, totally. Seriously? James, I'm sorry. Hey. Look at me, please. I'm sorry, okay? Really? Yes. I mean cuz if that's how you felt then you don't have to apologize for that. Camille, that's not how I feel. I promise. I can't believe you followed me here. You are embarrassed. You're embarrassed to introduce me to your parents. No no. Jesus, that's not it at all. I swear to God I... I'm not embarrassed, Camille. A spooky sound ate my parents? I never should have said that. Yeah, it was really fucked up. I, I lost my temper. You did. Again. Look, I was looking forward to spending our anniversary together and when you forgot again I, it's not an excuse, okay? And I'm sorry about the stupid shit that I said. I didn't mean it. I can't believe you followed me all this way. Yeah? Well you stopped answering my calls and you kind of left the state. Who's watching your vineyard? No one, actually. I sort of just left I thought I was just gonna come straight to your place... brought our anniversary dinner. There's nothing going on between James and I if that's what you're wondering. I wasn't. I told you before I don't care about James, Camille. I came because I want to make sure that everything is okay with you and I. Okay well good cuz he's my friend, okay? And we came here to do something important and we need to get it done and focus so if you have a problem with that then you can just..you can just go. I get it. Okay? I read you loud and clear, sweetie. I will uh, I'll sit over there. I just can't believe this. You hungry? No. That's too bad cause I have dinner. I mean, it's cold now, but, I also brought wine. Oh. Is that your solution for everything? A bottle of wine? Oh come on. The Camille I know would do just about anything for a bottle of wine. It's good wine! I love you. Let's just, let's just talk about this when we get home. Look, I'm sorry about what I said, ok? I didn't mean it I... I believe in you. Yeah well it's... it's just too bad you don't believe me. God, it's fucking freezing in this train. Why don't you uh... why don't you go get James. Yeah... And be nice, please. Okay. Hey.. Hey. Uh... Hunter. James. Good to meet ya man. Yeah. I'm uh, sorry about that back there. Oh, yeah... no worries. Why don't you come and join us. I uh, I brought wine. Oh, nice. Yeah. So... who wants wine? Are you old enough to drink? Ummmm Just messin with ya Jimmy. Yeah, that'd be great actually, it might help warm me up. Camille said you were a wine maker. Um, yes. That is uh, correct. And you? Oh I'm just a student. A film student. Right. So... what time did the guy say that we would uh.. we'd get there? I think he said about an hour or so. Wow. I can't believe we're on a train. Yeah. Yeah no we'll definitely have to come back and uh, enjoy this experience when it's not freezing as balls. Yeah, I'd love that. So remind me again, what exactly is it that you guys are doing? Well we're... Like I told you earlier um someone's doing a live stream of it from a ranch so we thought we'd come and try to capture something or... ya know, interview someone. Right, but didn't you say that "it" was uh... I don't know... dangerous? Well yeah, but we're not gonna get too close. Yeah, um... Camille is actually the subject um that I'm doing for, uh, one of my doc classes for, for film, so... yeah. I actually think it's getting a little warmer in here. Yeah I feel like drafts of warm air... coming from somewhere. Thank god. I think I actually saw a couple extra blankets in the other car. I'll go get em. No, no... it's fine. I'm fine. Um... the wine though actually.. Yes. if you could, open that. Hey, babe.. James. James. Guys... I think we're here. Uh, everyone please hang tight and keep all doors and windows closed until we get on our way again. Thank you. Did he just say "on our way again"? Wait did we, did we miss the stop? There's only one stop. We're in a tunnel. Wait, what? Why are we stopped? Maybe there's something on the tracks. No, no he said we're gonna be moving again. It's gotta be like a, like an engine issue or something. Uh, did the engineer come back here? Uh, or the other guy? - What other guy? - No. The, the guy on the intercom. No, I mean it's just been us back here. Do you guys know what's going on? We just woke up. Yeah. We've been stopped in this tunnel for almost an hour. An hour? Yep. My husband went out to go up and talk to the engineer like 30 minutes ago and he hasn't been back yet. He just said we were about to get going again. I thought that you said no one has been back here. On the intercom. Oh. Um. You can stay here with us if you want. I mean at least until your husband comes back. Yeah, here. Okay. Woah. That's not good. All right, everyone hold on. Here. Oh thank you. Oh. Thank you, James. You got another one of those? Yeah, uh, well, I have a headlamp. I'll just... use the light on my phone. Wait, Hunter where are you going? Honey it'll be fine. I'm just going to see what's going on. Um can you please ask my husband to come back? His name is Gary he has a, a black ball cap on. Gary, black ball cap. Got it. Wait! Honey, I'll be fine. Okay well be careful. Keep this door closed. I can't believe how cold it is out there. You're not from here? No. I mean I'm from Nevada, just not Kimberly. Vegas? Reno. I'm Rita by the way. James. Nice to meet you. I'm Camille. Are you guys from Kimberly? My aunt is. Oh, who is your aunt? Yeah, James... who's your aunt? Vadania... Hendricks. Yeah. Huh, no, I don't know her. Weird. So, uh, do you have family in Kimberly? No, uh my husband does. We are actually on our way to go attend his sisters funeral. Which is why I am worried that he is up there screaming at the engineer. He was already pissed off that the highway was shut down. Gosh, I'm so sorry. How did she die? James! Oh gosh! I'm, I'm so sorry I can't believe I just said that it just came out. It's okay. I always wonder the same thing when I hear that. I guess she died from a massive heart attack while she was alone on her ranch. Hmmm man that's terrible I'm, I'm so sorry. Where is her ranch? You are inquisitive, aren't you? Sorry. Nah... her ranch is right outside of Kimberly. That's all there is out here is ranches and farms. So, you said your husbands been gone for a while now? Almost an hour now. Did the train hit a bump or shake or anything like that? No, I mean I think it just slowed and came to a stop. And the engineer didn't say anything? Not until he came in and said to keep the doors closed. Hmm. Well I'm sure Hunter will be back with Gary really soon. He's probably up there yelling at them. God I hate when he gets like this. I, he's supposed to be giving a speech at dinner tonight Well I'm... I'm sure we're almost to Kimberly. Yeah we're about half way. Oh, have you ridden the train before? A few times for the fourth of July but never out this far. I mean usually it just goes like seven miles outside of Kimberly and turns back. I don't know where the hell we're at. What did they say? I have no idea. Yeah I couldn't understand that like at all. Hey! Hey! Shhh I'm sorry I just, just thought I heard someone outside speaking. What the hell are they doing up there? Want me to go look? - No. - Yes, please. Should we go look? Please. Okay. Sure. Thank you. Hey, can can you please ask Gary to come back? Will do. Oh do you need a... Oh, no, no I uh... Thank you. Stay warm. Thank you uh, uh, you too. I I mean, uh... thank you. I don't know about this. Look why don't you go back inside and um... I'll just run up and check on em right quick. No, it's okay. You sure? Yeah. Yeah, it's okay. Okay. Hello!? Hunter! Should we go up there? I don't really want to get into trouble. Just wait here. Well... Camille.. Be careful! Hello!? Hello? Hello is anyone there? Hello? James! What? It's not running! What!? The engine... it isn't running! What are you talking about? We have to go... now! Yeah... okay. Wait! Go! Run! Oh god! What happened? Wait wait wait wait - where's Gary? - There was nobody up there. - What do you mean? - There was nobody in the engine. - Oh does your phone work? No! What, what do you mean no one was up there? We didn't see anybody up there. Then where are they? I mean did you look around? Yeah we looked everywhere. Oh fuck. We didn't look in that other train car. What other train car? The other one the one that's in front of that other one we didn't go in there. Have you been in there? No! Why would they be up there? So nobody's looked in the other car? CAMILLE and RITA: No. Come on. There's definitely something wrong. Did you guys hear that? Yeah. Yeah I heard it. Not here. What is going on? I don't know. Ok, how far is it to Kimberly? I, I, I don't know. Uh.. I know that we're about half way or so. Okay but like in miles, like is it a couple miles - or a lot of miles? - I don't know. I don't know. It's far. Okay well maybe they just started walking to Kimberly, ya know? - Yeah. - All of them? I don't know. Maybe. You know what I bet it is? I bet uh, one of the switches on the track got frozen and they had to go chip it loose. Switch? Yeah like a switch on a railroad track you know like when you need to get over to another track there's a switch and it probably just froze. So. But, they they'd be back by now if that's what they were doing, wouldn't they? I don't know. What about the tunnel? Like, how long is this tunnel that we're in? I, I have no idea. Well, okay either they're, they're chipping the switch loose or they must have started walking to Kimberly because, they're not here. Gary, Gary would not have started to walk to Kimberly from here. They, they'd freeze they, they wouldn't make it. He knows better. God I wish the heaters were working. Do you want my jacket? Here I'm, I'm actually fine. No no it's okay really no I'm fine. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Thank you though. Would you guys mind just going back to check? Maybe they're back there. Maybe. No! We can't go outside we were supposed to stay inside. We can't be going outside! Why can't you go outside? Because we were just there and, and there was nothing there. I mean they, uh, and we heard wolves. - What? - Actually I think they were coyotes. - Does it matter? - Coyotes are fine! Coyotes are fine Coyotes they, they won't bother you. - No! - They leave you alone. No, the engineer specifically told us to stay inside, to keep the windows and doors shut I mean it is freezing out there! They did say tonight was supposed to be negative - Thank you. - twelve degrees, so... Will one of you please just go back? - No! - They have to be out there, they have to be back! Have to! What the fuck was that? did you hear what they said? They, they're, they're back No! Go up there.. please please just just... just go grab..go get Gary! No! We were just fucking there. Listen to me! Listen! We cannot keep opening and closing these doors Alright, alright, alright. and keep letting the heat out this is the only heat we have. Alright! I'm gonna go up there and check. What!?

There's something out there... It's, I could feel it... This sound... it's people. It stopped. It stopped! Oh god it stopped. We did it. Baby we did it! We are back now with breaking news. We are just learning about a tragedy that unfolded last night near the small town of Kimberly, Nevada. A landslide forced the closure of the highway between Kimberly and Lehman. From what we understand the local train museum offered rides back and forth for residents. Their tracks were not affected by the landslide. The train ride was about an hour and a half and the train stalled in a tunnel half way through the ride. Several people are still missing. The lack of heaters and record low temps left the passengers in a dangerous situation. I'm just being told we have a passenger. Rita Smith. Rita, what can you tell us about your experience? I... I don't think that I can talk about this right now.. I'm sorry. No... No! What? That's... How? How!? No!
