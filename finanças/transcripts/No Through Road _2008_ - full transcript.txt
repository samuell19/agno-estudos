Subtitles by explosiveskull I'm so pumped! Good for you! - Go! - Hey mate. Hey mate. Hey, who you going for? Oi, who you going for in the Derby? - Free-O! - Free-O, Eagles! Oi, I'm talking to you. Who you going for in the derby, mate? Oi, who's this guy? Hey mate. Hey you fucking fag! Fuck! What are you doing in there? - I'm sorry. - How did you get in here? I'm sorry, I had nowhere else to go. Do you want money or something? - 'Cause I haven't gotten... - I'm not a fucking thief, OK? You just broke into my house! - What do you want? - Nothing. I'd like you to get out of my closet, slowly. What are you doin' in here? Who are you? Nobody. What's your name? Sam, Samantha. Look, I just, I just need a place to hide, OK? This is my house. You think you're gonna stay? Then I'm gonna call the police. No, don't! Look, I fucking need your help, man, please! If you tell me what the problem is, then maybe I could help. I can't. Please just, just let me stay for a while, please, and then I'll go. I promise. You're bleeding. Fuck. Come on. Maybe try knocking next time. See ya. It's a nice house you have, eh? Yeah, thanks. Is it yours? Yeah, it is now, used to be my mom... I used to live, um, can you just not smoke in here? Are they the reason you were running? Yeah, I was just in a park down the road and they just fucking started chasing me, hey. Don't you think that's a bit strange that they're just gonna chase you for no reason? I mean, you didn't encourage them? No, what the fuck are you saying? I didn't say I'm right. I just meant it seems a little strange, OK? We can call the police. No, don't call the fucking police, OK? Right, in which case, I'm a bit stumped then because I don't know what to do. Can't we do nothing? Hey, Charles is the name. My friends call me Chaz. How can I help ya? That depends, really. See, now just hear me out before you call me crazy. I live about two suburbs away and I've been noticing some pretty strange behavior from my neighbor. You know the sort. I'm talking about a real meth chef. Now, he's got a shed out the back. He's in it all night long. People are coming in and out all day. It's pretty fucking strange, huh? I mean, these aren't the sorts you want hanging around your home, you know what I mean? Lovely place like this. I'm not sure what you want. Well, this guy and his girlfriend, they run a primo lab, sweet, primo, and no one's gonna know about it until it fucking blows up and some poor fucking kid's gonna be pulling shards from his face for six months. Fucking, that's fucked up. I'm still not sure what you're getting at. I just want to have a little chat with your visitor in there. Is she in there? She in there? I just want to escort her down to the station for questioning or something, you know, just routine. That's ridiculous, no. Is it? Look, buddy. If I'm wrong, then I pissed off my dirtbag neighbor. Fuck him. If I'm right, if I'm right, then you and me just saved the day. You know what I'm saying? What do you reckon? Tell you what. I'll come in there and get her. You don't need to say a word, mate. Can you just go back in the living room? Go! I think it's time you left. This has nothing to do with you, mate. Yeah, please go. It's fucking bullshit, man. The prick won't give her up. I was this fucking close! Had him on the ropes. So what's the deal, T? Do we take off or what? What the fuck do you think? We're waitin' for Eddie. Yeah, but where is Eddie, huh? He said to meet him at the park. Yeah, well, I don't know if you noticed, man, but this ain't the fucking park. You want to be the one to tell him we had her and let her go? Look, let's just go. We're not going anywhere. We're staying here, all right? So let's chill the fuck out, have a beer, and listen to the game. I don't know, man. This guy seems like a bit of a hard cunt. We'll see how fucking hard he is. Early days yet, Chaz, and the bitch has to come out sometime. You just need to let me stay here for a while and then I'll go, OK? I'm calling the police. No, please don't! Why? You just can't, OK? You can't. Is that in case I find your drug lab? I don't have a fucking drug lab! Does it look like I'm in the money? I'm not a bad person, OK? I'm not. I'd be more inclined to believe you if you used the police to help you with your problems, instead of just climbing into people's closets. You can't stay here. I don't want any part of it. I'm sorry. What's wrong? I don't know. Wouldn't know about those, would you? Well, I don't know. I'd say without those, your car is pretty fucked up. It's not funny anymore, OK? You've broken the law. I'm calling the police. What are you gonna tell them? That we pulled some wires out of your car? Why are you doing this? Don't make me call the police. Look, we just want to talk to the girl. Well, why does it matter to you, huh? We're doing a fucking community service here, mate, so just cut the bullshit, bring her out, and maybe we can all get back to enjoying the game. You fucking look at me when I'm talking to you! Ooh, look of a hard man. You can do what you like, mate. I couldn't give less of a shit 'cause only one thing is certain. I'm gonna talk to that fucking slut tonight, whether you like it or not. What the hell have you got me involved in? - What? - I'm calling the police unless you tell me what is going on, now! I've already told ya, I can't! Fuck, fuck! Look, I need to know what is going on. I can't! You can trust me. I was in the park down the road. And they raped me. Oh, Jesus. Can you hear that, oh, what's that? What's that? Oh, that's right. Get that up here, you prick. That's my team in there. Yeah, and if you'd called earlier, Chaz, we'd be at the fucking game. Fuck that, man. This fucking game was sold out in minutes. All those member cunts got in there before me. Always the same, mate. You're a walking clusterfuck. Get fucked. You want to fucking say it again now that I can hear you, mate? Come on, come on. Look, let's just get out of here, all right? 34 points but down 16. We're late in the second quarter. We stay here until I say. Man, who cares about her, all right? Let's just go. Getting cold feet, you little faggot, huh? No, I just think it's pointless hanging out in front of some dick's house, listening to the football, when we could be watching it on the TV. We've got unfinished business with that bitch, and you know it, Rob. So we don't go until Eddie's satisfied. You got it? Where the fuck is Eddie? He'll be here soon, so buck the fuck up, sunshine. It's gonna be a long night. Look, those men are criminals. They need to be in prison, otherwise they're just gonna do it to somebody else. I don't want to press charges. I can't, I... Well, what do you wanna do? I just want to get the fuck out of this house. We don't have a car. What? Fucking, can't we slip by them? Fuck, have you got another way out? Yeah, we might make it, but our legs wouldn't. OK, I might have a plan. They're loitering, right? They're causing a disturbance. I got a family friend. He used to be a cop. I'm sure he can get rid of them unofficially. Go! Go, you mongrels, go, go! Oh, fuck, unbelievable! Yes, that's the way, boys! Oh, hello! Yes. I suppose I could. What's wrong? Sorry, you're cutting out. Hello? Hello? Who was that? It was Bill's son, Richie. Who? Richie, Bill's son. Bill, he's been dead for years. I know! It's his son, Richie! God, deaf as a post. I heard that! Twat. Hey! You boys all right? Reckon you could pass us the ball? Nice kick. You should see me in front of the big sticks. Richie, what's going on? So you've seen them tampering with your car? That's something. Well, no, I didn't see them, but it's obvious it was them. They didn't deny it. Oh, good enough for me, but... Oh, shit! Ned, if you weren't gonna help, why did you turn up? Hey, just calm down, all right? I want to help, but standing in the road being pricks is not illegal yet. Richie. It's Richard. Richard. You gotta admit it's pretty strange. You got a junkie sitting on your couch, reading coffee table books. I'm not fucking stupid. Cut the shit, then I can sort this out. It was nice to meet you. You too. All right, so that's it, then? The police aren't gonna do anything about the fact we've been threatened and bullied and intimidated? As far as I can see, no crime has been committed here. I'm going back to watch the game with my deaf wife. You can't just leave. Watch me. OK. Are you serious? Yeah. They raped here and they're just hanging around out the front? Yeah, well, why do you think I called you? Now we've got something. I'll call it in. That might be a problem. What the fuck are you talking about? She doesn't want to press charges. You gotta be kidding me. Well, what do you want me to do? I don't know. You were the cop. Couldn't you just get rid of them? I suppose I could put the frighteners on 'em. I know. Jesus, put that away! Thanks. Just put it down. Don't be such a girl. Whatever you want to do is fine, OK? But can you just put it away before you shoot someone? Feel better? The apple fell far from the tree. Your old man could shoot the whiskers off a kitten. Then I'm not my old man. No, you're not. Shame he's no longer with us. We'd be at the game right now. Better keep an eye on your little friend there. She's climbing the walls. Hey, you hear what I'm saying? So what's going on? Ned's gonna help us, unofficially. You got nothing to worry about. I'll get rid of those jokers, then I'll get you home. Thanks. Me and Richie's dad go way back. Yeah, he was the toughest piny bastard I ever met. You were friends, eh? The best. Right, let's get this show on the road. What's the score? - Whistlers up. - Oh, bugger! Glad I missed out on tickets. Your mate all right? Yeah, he's fine. He was cheeky to the wrong people. Oh, this used to be such a nice neighborhood. Yeah, I blame the railways. Yeah, they bring in all sorts of riffraff, don't they? You boys up for a kick? Settle down, old man. You already kicked the ball once tonight. We don't want you to put your knee out, mate. I reckon, you go down to the end of the street. You go right down to the end of the street and I can land the ball right on your chest, guaranteed. All right, why don't you get your friend out here to have a kick with us? Nah, he can't kick for shit. I tried it once. He's a self-important ass-end like you are. Fighting for a badge. All right, Rob, off you go. Let's see the old man sharpshoot. Oh, hey, hey, hang on, hang on. Why not yourself? More of a rugby man, mate. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hoo, I wouldn't say that in bloody company, mate, and I wouldn't advertise it either. Go on. I guarantee you won't have to move a muscle. Ah, a bit further, don't be a pussycat. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. What's the matter with ya? Ah, bugger. Nice kick, moron. How are we gonna find the ball? Well, I guess you're right about my kicking, hm. Need a hand? To find it? No, how about you go get it 'cause you fucking kicked it? Well, you see, now I've got a problem. What's that? I need you guys to move on. Crawl back under the rock you came from. Why don't you just save us all the time and embarrassment? Hop in your car and be on your way. Did you hear me, hm? You think this is funny? You don't think I've seen this before? You're just a bunch of pricks. Fuck off. Look, mate, I don't know what it is you think you know, but it looks to me like you got your wires crossed. Those wires? Now listen. You can hop in your piece of shit car and fuck off, or I can call this in and you can spend the night in the slammer. The choice is yours. What the fuck are you doing? He was going for his fucking gun. No, he wasn't, he was going for his rider to scare us. That's bullshit, man! It's right there! The fucking phone's dead! They've cut the fucking line! What? Fuck! Fuck! Oh shit. Fuck! T. T. Toryn! Hide the pig. You in there, hard man? Knock knock. How 'bout my girl? You looking after her for me? I bet you are. You did this. Your pig friend is turning cold right now 'cause you fucked up. If you hadn't called him, he'd be home watching the game with his wife. Now, I'm gonna be just a moment. I'm gonna be right back with you. I promise, and... I've got the pig's radio, so if you call any more cops, well, that would be a real fucking shame. What are they waiting for? Why are they just sitting there? They're waiting for Eddie. Who the fuck is Eddie? Jesus Christ, do you fucking know them? Fuck, look, come here. Look at that, look. Look, you see that? Look! Ned's fucking dead! They just murdered him. You see? Understand that? You're a fucking liar! - I'm not! - Did they even rape you? Yes! - Yeah, bullshit! - They did! They did! A year ago. Sure. They raped me. I did what you were supposed to. I went to the police and you know what they did? They put one of them away for five months and three fucking days! Why are they here now? They think I fucked up their lives! I'm the one, I'm the one who had to sit there with them all looking at me! They all looked at me with the same looks on their faces that you had! You've had that look on your fucking face when I came to you for help. And now... And now, Ned, Ned's dead, and it's all my fault. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Just calm down, all right? I'm so sorry. Just, we're gonna do something. It's just that they're gonna know if the cops come. I'm sorry. I can see 'em, man. They're right there. Not without Eddie. What's the difference, man? We just killed a fucking cop! Wait for my brother. Remember my brother, Chaz? The man who took all the fucking heat for us, mate? Something like... If people could come, yeah, if people could come to the house, then they couldn't get in. What about your neighbors? Shit, anyone? The street's, it's too fucking dead. There's no... What? Richie what, fucking what? We can't just fucking sit here and wait for them to get in! I've got an idea, all right, OK, just... I don't know how much time time we've got, all right, but we're gonna need some stuff. Maybe not here. It's fucking bullshit, man. Fucking bullshit. Oi. Ah, they're not coming anywhere. Fuck 'em. No one gives a shit. Look at this place. Hey, I couldn't find anything to add to your collection, but I reckon the radio should do it. OK. OK. Oh, fuck, what's wrong? Who knows what's gonna happen when we do this? I don't even know if it's gonna work. Fuck 'em. Now they've taken a backwards step! Standing toe-to-toe in front of a famed... Australia's gone for goal, long way to go yet. Is that it? Fucking light show put to music. You spineless twat. Or maybe you're trying to show me how tough you are. 'Cause I told you not to fuck around! And you didn't listen. You're a tough man. Well, show me that. Fucking come out and show me! I thought so. Now that we know you've got no balls, I'm gonna give you five seconds to open the door before I kick it in. And if you open it now, maybe I won't cut your fucking fingers off before I kill ya. One. Two. Three! What the fuck are you... Don't. Hey, Mike from next door. Oh. Sorry, guys, I'm probably just gonna go. Nice light show you got. Oh, um, sorry about that. It's all right. Usually me making all the fuss around here. You weren't at the football? I hate football. What's the deal with you anyway? You all right? Not really, no. That's weird. Why? I don't want to sound crazy, but this has kind of been the... What's wrong with you? Um, nothing, um, we're actually, yeah, we are fine. Thanks. You sure? Yeah, you should just probably go home. We just, um, we got carried away with the stereo, and we're just sorry about the noise. We'll try and keep it down. See ya. Good boy. Actually, I'm kind of disappointed. I wanted you to make me hammer his fucking head in, too. You got five minutes, cunt. Oh, he's missed a lot of freebies. I know you wanna wait for Eddie. We can't wait anymore, mate. Every second we give them, they're gonna try some other shit. Before you know it, we'll be in a fucking cell with our backs to the wall. Forward to Ian Will, got it to Josh Gard, now McManus, who's been tremendous in the main time today. You know what needs to happen. No. This needs to stop. I can't let them get in here because they'll kill you, then they'll kill me. What are we gonna do? Forward with space, now Sheffield, and he goes to center-half, oh, and he saw Sullivan. Ooh, they're five-wide. Get out of my house! I said stop! Fuck, fuck! Hey there. You've been a naughty junkie, haven't ya? Bet you're just aching for a hit. Now, you and that limey prick, you pissed us off something fucking chronic. That's all right. Fuck that shit, all right? It's all right 'cause we've got a good thing going on, and I don't want to ruin that so... All's fair in love and war. I am kind of glad that it's just you and me, though, because, uh... I've been wondering what your cunt looks like from the inside. What the fuck? Get out of my house. What'd you say? You heard me. I don't think I did, mate. I think you have to repeat that shit. All right, I'll say it in a language you can understand. Get out of my house or I'm cutting your fucking head off. Go on, faggot. Do it. Oh, God, you cut my fucking face! Thank you. It's OK. He cut my fucking face! Shit, man, fucking! Where did this come from? My study. It was my father's. He must have been a mighty warrior. Yeah, I suppose he was. He was a cop. I'm not really sure why he had it. I wonder if he ever thought it'd be used like that. When he was behind me... I thought that was the end of it. I never want to feel like that again. You won't. OK. Let's go, come... What the fuck are you doing? No! No, no, no, I need that, no! I need you! I need you! It's like I'm already dead. I don't want to feel it, OK? I want it to be painless. That's all I want. No. We have to cope. OK, just hold, just hold me. Shame the way it turned out, eh? I didn't even get to see the end of the game. What are you gonna do now? I don't know. Yeah, that'd be right. Your dad would have blasted his way out of here like a man. And you, you couldn't even keep me alive. That poor girl. You can handle yourself. You think they would have tried anything if there'd been two of us? Instead, you hid behind a couch. I'm sorry. Oh, give me a break for Christ's sake. Did you tell her what you were doing when your old man was being beaten like a dog? You were taking pretty pictures. Well, I hope you kept some of them. I bet you got some hanging on your wall. You ever think what would've happened if you'd been with him that night? Maybe you could have protected him. But you didn't. Now, he's gone. And so am I. Yeah, only a matter of time before they get in here. She's gonna die tonight. And it'll be your fault. Richard, something did happen at the park today. What was, I thought you said they left? Sh, it's just a trick. They're just trying to flush us out the front. We have to go, OK? - Run! - Fuck, fuck! - Come on, please. - You cunt! Richard! Morning. Huh? What's going on here then? That's right, mate. This is it. What did you think was gonna happen? That you were gonna come riding in and save the day, is that it? You fucking pussy. You'll have to excuse me. I've just gotta go help my mate Rob rape someone. Probably his turn, but don't worry. Chaz here'll keep you company. He's got a shed full of tools. And you and him are going to have so much fun. Right, Chaz? Fucking A. Fucking A. Oh, and don't worry about the bitch. You won't hear her scream. I promise. She's gonna have her mouth full. Keep her warm for me. I will, mate. What did you think was gonna happen? Yeah, she's asleep. So go get your underwear, son. It's about fucking time we made a man of you, Rob, isn't it? No, I can't, not while she's asleep. You fucking faggot. You're gonna fuck her, Rob, oh, sorry, make love to her, whatever you want to call it, and what's more, mate, when you're done, you're gonna finish her off. - You mean... - Yeah. They've seen her face, you dipshit. Nah, I can't. You listen to me, cunt! You don't have a choice. And then you're gonna kill her and there is no option B for you, Rob, because if you don't, I'm gonna fucking kill you next,. Now get in there, sunshine. Fuck! No! T! Where you goin'? You keep her at the house. I'm gonna try and find Eddie, wherever the fuck he is. Wake up, Geoff. You wouldn't want to miss anything, mate. Huh? How many fingers am I holding up? All right, just, sorry, just... I just wanna get my head around it. Maybe you could just help me out here. What would you do if someone tried to cut your head off? The only reason I ask is 'cause tonight, someone tried to cut my head off. No, I just, I'm at a loss, mate. To be honest, it upsets me. Well, I can see you're not taking any of this in, so why don't we just play it by ear, see what we got, shall we? All right, you need anything? You all right? Little parched? Good. Ooh, OK, that's bullshit. Ah, oh! Done that. That's done. Whoa, whoa. Hey, what the fuck is that? Awesome, huh? Fuck that. Fuck that, woo-hoo! What do we have here? OK, now we're gonna play a little game. Left or right, pick a hand. Come on. Come on, bookworm. You don't wanna play? I bet you're one of those cunts who used to cheat at Heads Down, Thumbs Up. Annoying, mate? You're not gonna play? Why don't you take a look at what you could have taken home? Take a gander at that. Well, you reckon you ever seen one like that? Look at the length on that. How does that grab you, mate? What about that? It's fucking heavy. It's fucking heavy. No, you're not, you're, no, no. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. You're gonna feel this. You're gonna feel it. Line her up. Ooh, hear that? You ready? Yeah, fucking scream! Scream for me, cunt! You fucking scream! That's what that fucking bitch is gonna be doing right now! Scream for me! Oh, that's fire. That's really fucking cleared me right up. I just needed to get that off my chest. What the fuck? I gotta be honest with you now, mate. I don't know what the fuck this thing's for, but I... But I bet you it's a lot of fun. Let's fucking try it out. What do you say? Fuck. I'm gonna need you to hold still then, all right? Now, you fucking hold still. Here we go. Stay. Fuck is, what the fucking... What the fuck happened? What the fuck. Fuck. Fuck. The cops, cops, we gotta get the cops! Let's get the cops, come on! Samantha! Who the fuck is Samantha? Fuck, let's go! - Come on! - Get help! Get help. Fuck off! Eddie? Fuck! Hello? Rob, she's killed Eddie. Fucking kill her now. Uh, I... Rob, if you don't tear her apart, I'll fucking end you, you cunt. Fuck! Did you kill Eddie? Fucking what do you think? He would, he would have killed me! What do you think he would have done to me if I didn't? You need to let me go. Shut up! If you don't let, if you don't let me go, they're gonna come here and they'll kill me. Please, you don't want that. You don't want that. I like you. Fuck. I went to school. I have a cat. I'm just, I'm just like you. You're not like them. I know it. I know it. Sorry about the wait, mate. Just had to pick up an old friend. Remember this? I remember this. Here's the plan. We're gonna start with the leg, and then we'll work our way up, all right? All right, have it your way, man of few words. OK. Ready or not, here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it... Please. It's all right. It's OK. It's OK, I'm just... It's all right, it's all right. It's OK. Yeah. It's all right. It's OK, yeah. Shh. Shh. Fucking pussy. Fucking cunt. Subtitles by explosiveskull
