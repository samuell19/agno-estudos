Lobang was wrongfully right Yet rightfully wrong And so, we have to take the necessary actions Lum Yes sir Take over Yes sir Diver Lobang, front and centre Yes sir Explain to me Why did you jeopardise your life and the life of your swim buddy by taking the most dangerous route? Sir l knew it would be impossible for me to escape through the front gate because there were too many guards on duty But sir, you know what When l was about to give up l saw the Frogman from the sea pointing his finger at the top of the HQ building Then I realised that was the message from the Frogman from the sea Telling me that as a diver I shouldn't give up easily because nothing stands in my way But at that point of time, l still don't know what to do until l saw it fly Really sir l saw it flew across the Parade Square over the top of the HQ building towards the sea Then suddenly l realised the hidden message l remembered what you said before If you swim towards the right you will reach Sembawang Park and we can book out straight from there That's where l booked out No sir That's where l escaped So now you are blaming me for teaching you to take the most dangerous route to leave camp Is that so? No sir Then? Sir It's not dangerous until you forget that it is We never forget that We did it very carefully Ifit is easy, we don't want to do it and we are trained for it The sea is our comfort zone The sea is our domain Danger is our business l really had no choice sir l am very impressed that you hold all our divers' core values in your heart and in your head Join back your class Thank you sir 48, as your course warrant it is my responsibility to train you hard But at the same time l will not overlook your safety l trained you to be divers What Lobang and Wei Ming did is something l refuse to accept By putting your lives at danger It's really jeopardising this entire course It is also my responsibility to understand your problems If l cannot solve your problems l can guarantee you the next in rank following the chain of command will be able to It takes a man courage to admit his mistake And l admit l did not understand Lobang's problems For every mistake there will be a punishment l have no excuse for my mistake For that I will punish myself by doing a hundred push-ups 48 One for all All for one What do you want to eat? l will bring back for you tomorrow It's okay, l have meat jerky Enjoy your weekend Lobang, sitting down?

Nothing stands in our way Eat up Mom l see dead people The only time we don't see demons is during chow time We see only angels Because during training all our instructors are like devils from hell Welcome to CDC My territory Welcome to hell But now l think the reason for me to see so many angels around us It's because during the meal time or what we call the chow time is the only time when all instructors stop yelling and pointing their fingers at us but treat us like pampered little babies They are like angels to us Or at least for the time being Excuse me Excuse me Emergency! Very important Excuse me, l cannot take it anymore How can you take it without washing your faces for so many days? Who wants to wash their face?
