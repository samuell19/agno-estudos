Sasha gets it on her back in little white spots all the time. Well, this is very clearly red. Tinea Versicolor can be any color. That's what the Versicolor part of Tinea Versicolor means. -Oh, stop saying Tinea-- -Stop moving your head. Are you going to clean all of this it up? Oh, no. No, we were just going to weave it into a nice little carpet. -I want to keep it longish. -Mm-hmm.

Okay, thanks for the heads up. I didn't know. -This is nice, isn't it? -Can you not? I just wanna be close to you, Rio. Yeah, this is-- this is nice. [cheerful music playing] -Got you a coffee. -[Avery] Almond latte? Uh, no, regular latte. I don't drink regular milk. [Lou] Well, I did not know that. Haven't for years. I'm sure the cows really appreciate it. Why are you cleaning the fridge? Why don't you go home and clean your own fridge? You should be grateful. It's disgusting. How can you live like this? Are you going to be here all weekend? Why are you being such a prat? This house isn't big enough for all of us. It was big enough growing up. This house ain't big enough for the both of us. Pew, pew. -So, what are you up to today? -This. It's the same thing you do every day. -You're tragic. -You can talk. Why don't you go to TAFE or something? -There's an idea. -And do what? Just pick something. See how you like it. Oh, that's great advice. I'm sure it will set me up for a lifetime of happiness. [Avery] Well, nothing can set you up for a lifetime of happiness. You can at least set yourself up for some financial security. You should at least be working to save. Like Lou. Seriously, you need to be doing something. Can you stop? -Figuring it out. -Are you? -[car horn honks] -Oh! Okay, yeah, Sasha's here with my bookcase. The bookcase is, like, the only piece of furniture I owned in that house. Can you give us a hand? Yeah, I'll do it. [Lou] Use those muscles, Avery. -[Avery] My God. -[Lou] My Cross-Fit queen [Avery] You're not helping. -You should just get rid of it. -No. No, I paid $50 for this thing. -Ah, fuck! -What? -Oh, shit. -Ow. All right, come with me. Goose. That's better. Thanks for bringing it. Did she give you shit? I'm fucking done with Bea. What? You have a hickey. [anxiously chuckles] Yeah. I didn't give it to you. No? [anxiously chuckles] Who did? Why? What, you jealous? You want one? [chuckles] [Lou] Oh, come on. When we started, I explained to you, and you agreed. Let's-- let's go and do something, yeah? We can get some weed. We can get really fucking high. We can go watch some art house films. I don't want to get high. Are you drunk right now? Lou, it's not even 12, you can't keep doing this to yourself. Fucking great, well, um... we'll just go watch the movie then. I need to say something. We've always said "I love you." Before we even knew what it meant. And I do love you. The you that's my best friend. But now I love you the other way, too. And I tried not to, but honestly, I knew going in that this would happen. I just ignored it. I just pretended that it wasn't true because... I wanted more. And I want more again. And I'm sorry. I know that you don't want a relationship. I've heard everything that you've ever said about marriage and monogamy and your parents and my parents but I honestly think if you could just get over your bullshit, we could be happy. Two best friends that also like having sex, like, isn't that the dream? I'm not getting out of this unscathed either way. I can deal with it if it fails, but I can't not know, okay? Not knowing... is making me go fucking insane. So, I'm asking this stupid question. I have to ask it. Can we try this? Can we just try it? You already know the answer. It kind of sucks that you're making me say it. -Oh, it's a no? -[Lou] Of course, it's a no. Why "of course"? Why is it so insane that I love someone, and I want them to love me back? I'm not letting you force your heteronormative constructs on me. -I'm not forcing-- -[Lou] Yeah, you are! Okay, look, non-monogamy is a valid and beautiful choice, and a far likelier recipe for happiness than the monogamy that's forced upon us by fu-- Catholicism, mostly. And it's not the result of some bullshit or something that I have to get over. I think you're the one who needs to get over your bullshit, not me. Maybe. Maybe I've been brainwashed... but I-- I love you. And I want to be with you. And I'm not trying to lock you down or force you into some kind of contract for forever. I'm just saying I want you and me to just try and just have it, just us for a while. I can't deal with the others, Lou. I can't see that fucking hickey on your neck without wanting to die. [Sasha sighs, sniffles] I hate it when you cry, Sasha. I love you. You know I do. And you're still my best friend. Can't we just pretend that you never said anything? God, let's just forget that this ever happened. All right, let's just take some acid and we'll erase the whole thing, right? Ayahuasca. Okay, that's what we need. We-- we-- we'll shit our fucking pants, and we'll feel so, so much better. Yeah, there's always a fucking joke. No, we can't erase it. We can't pretend. -I've told you that I love you. -All right, fine, it was a mistake. We never should have started hooking up in the first place. -We can just go back-- -We can't fucking go back, Lou, -listen to me. -I am listening! What do you mean? I don't know. What do you mean, "We can't go back"? I don't know how I can be friends with you, and hang out like it's normal while I feel like this. Well, that's completely fucked up and unfair. You knew going into this, that this is what it would come to. Why the fuck did you start it then? Wow, I'm going. -Where the fuck are you going? -I'm going. Well, stay, or we can go somewhere, -and we can talk. -I think I just need you to leave me alone for a while. -Are you-- are you serious? -Yes, Lou, I'm serious. Leave me alone. [dramatic instrumental playing] -Bye. -Bye. [door clicks closed] [steps approaching] [sighs] That was fucking crazy. I can't believe you're sleeping with her. Not anymore. -Why would you do that? -Why not? She's been your best friend forever. -We'll be fine. -You can't just treat people like garbage over and over again. And what the hell do you know about? Why are you so okay with hurting her? [Lou] Oh, my God. This is about Daniel. What has he done now? What, did he-- did he pack the dishwasher wrong? Did he put regular milk in your coffee? You don't know what you're talking about. No, please, Avery, enlighten us. What has Prince Charming done -this time? -He's cheating on me. Okay? Again. Because he's compulsive. So, yeah, maybe I'm feeling a little bit sensitive about people just happily destroying the people they love over and over again for no good reason. It's fucked. You're fucked! Avery. -Where is your self-respect? -Where's my self-respect? Where's yours? When you're opening your legs for half the city? I love a little slut shaming on a Saturday. That's real nice. Hey, I'm not taking your shit on top of hers. -There's no fucking way. -[Avery] I try to tell you-- You know what, everything that you just said is so fucking disgusting, -I wish I recorded it. -Shut the fuck up. [Lou] Wait, what's your fucking deal? You've been acting weird all weekend. 'Cause I want you to leave me the hell alone. No, we come to stay all the time, and now, it's a big fucking problem? What are you hiding? I'm not hiding anything. You're full of shit. [Avery] Is there actually something going on? -No, she's full of shit. -Obviously, hiding something. -I'm not. -You're practically sweating. -Fuck off. -Oh, what is it, Rio? I'm meeting Dad tomorrow. Oh, for fuck's sake. Happy? I don't care what arguments you have against it, okay? I didn't give a shit what you think. -Rio, no. -Did you hear what I just said? I don't care what you said. It's a terrible idea. I'm not going to let you do it. [Lou] You can't stop him. Seriously. Why bother? -Maybe because he's my dad. -He's our dad. He hasn't been anything to us in like, ten years. [sighs] How did this happen? [Rio] He found me online. -[scoffs] Of course he did. -There's nothing you can say. There's plenty that we can say. Where are you going? You got somewhere better to be? [Lou] I don't want to get into it... but he was a crap dad, and he was super shitty to Mom. Yeah, you said. Yeah-- You don't understand. He was a bad guy. Not just because he left his wife and three kids, he was plainly bad. [footsteps approaching] What if we have other siblings out there? What, don't you wanna know? Aren't you curious? No, I don't want to know. [bottles clanking] Good idea. Awesome. Maybe you two hate him, and maybe Mom hates him, but I don't know him. It's not about hate, Rio. What is it about? [sighs] This is-- Can I have some of that? [bottle cap rattles] [bottle cap rattles] This is healthy? Not a little ironic? You know me. Healthy, healthy. Just say what you want to say. [sighs] Okay. He-- He was a-- He was an asshole. He was a violent, alcoholic asshole. What? What did he do? In specifics? Yeah, he'd-- He'd... grab us and... shove us around. You know, smack us till... we couldn't sit down and... just throw things. Whatever bottle was in his hand, usually. The occasional chair. Mom got the worst of it. We used to put on a show for you in the shed. When things got really bad, to hide. We used to pull your stuffed animals out of a bucket hat. I was the great and powerful Lulu. -What about me? Did he ever-- -[Lou] No. No one would let him. You were too little. [Rio] Why didn't anyone tell me? It's not exactly something you reminisce about. [Rio] Yeah, but it's a thing that happened to my family. You knew it was bad. I thought he was a bit of a dick. I thought he drank a bit. Not a child and a wife beater. Well, now you do know. He doesn't deserve to see you. Why did he leave? [sighs] Because he's a dick. But he was fine being a dick for all that time before he left. He didn't come into it fully committed. It just took him a while to get the guts to bail, I guess. I think it was probably around the time that I started minding being hit. Did you fight back? I don't really remember. That's not-- That's not it. What are you talking about? He wasn't the reason you left. What? One day Sasha was over. And we were in-- We were in my room, and we were playing. We were naked. We were hugging and just like... pretending to have sex. Well, kids do that sort of thing all the time. Dad came in and found us. And called her mum to come pick her up. I-- I just-- I knew it was coming. I could feel it. Absolutely thrashed me. ♪ It was the worst beating that I ever got. With the shit that he said. It was ju-- That's so fucked up. Happy? Why didn't you ever tell me that? 'Cause we don't talk about things, right? I feel like I barely know you two. Well, because you don't know the worst things that ever happened to us? Because I don't know anything that happened. [train whirring] [TV playing] [screaming] [swords clanking] I'm hungry. I'm starving. So many options. [Lou] Not really. -Should I get chips? -[both] Yes. [Avery laughs] I'm not sitting on a random wall. Come and sit. Why? It's clean. Sit down, Avery. -Yeah, sit down, you mole. -Sit down. Sit down. [Avery groans] Holy shit. This is really good. Mmm. -This was a good idea. -Fantastic. It's the best I've ever eaten. I love chicken salt. Mm, best thing about Australia. Yeah, but other places have chicken salt too. -No, no, they don't. -Yeah, of course they do. -We didn't invent chicken salt. -Yeah, we did. Like we invented pavlova? We didn't-- we didn't invent pavlova? [laughs] Remember that time when Grandma made that pavlova? When? It was for Christmas one year. But it tasted like an omelet. I remember that. And then you threw it up afterwards -when we were playing tip. -What? And then you cried. [baby talk] Baby Rio. That wasn't tip. Everyone was just chasing me around. And you pushed me on the road. You're a psycho. I didn't-- He ran onto the road. Whatever. You're a bad sister. What, you tried to drown me in the bath, you bitch. -You slipped. -No, I didn't. Because I have very rough feet. So it's impossible for me to slip on surfaces such as that. [Rio coughs] So, you're still going to go tomorrow? I-- I heard what you said. I believe you. It's just-- I want to see him. I wanna talk to him. It's-- It's not like-- I'm not going to hug him or anything. And it's not going to be a regular thing. It's just-- I don't know. [floor creaking] Morning, sunshine. [Rio groans] It's nine. I wasn't sure what time you're meeting him. Not till 12. Oh. -[car honking] -[engine roaring] Should I go? If you need to go, you need to go. Maybe I'll go with you. Really? Yeah. You don't have to go for me or anything. It's not just to do with you. Maybe he'll be different. -Maybe we could try. -No, I doubt it. -[knocking on door] -[Avery] Yeah? I'm going with Rio. -[water splashing] -Say again. I'm going with Rio. Maybe you should come too. And get some closure. Maybe save on therapy. [Avery] No, I'm not going. But I can drive you. Okay. -[knocking on door] -Yeah? -You ready? -Mm-mm. I don't know what to wear for this sort of thing. Neither. You two look nice. He hasn't gone in yet. Maybe he's late. He could already be in there. Maybe he's not coming. -[door handle rattling] -Hey. Don't tell him I'm here, okay? Okay. [car honking] [indistinct chatter] [chuckles] Hi. Um, can I get you guys a drink? -No, thanks. -No, thanks. I didn't know you were coming. Um, I mean, I'm glad. It's a-- it's a great surprise. I didn't know this was happening, so... You're both so grown up. -Your sister-- -Avery. She didn't want to come? No. Well, guess I can understand that. It's good to see you two. [chuckles] Yeah, can't get over how grown up you both are. Did you think we'd look the same? No, no, I mean, I've seen his photos online since we've been talking, but you look so different. Look at your hair. Sure I can't get you a drink? You hungry? My treat. -No, thanks. -I'm okay. Oh, I was really glad when you answered. I mean, I wanted to reach out earlier, you know, but after the first time-- What-- what first time? Avery didn't tell you? I tried to reach out to her a few years ago. You didn't reach out to her. Some woman did. She messaged Avery saying that she wanted to chat, that-- He'd been looking for us even though we still live in the same house where he left us. Sky reached out back then because I asked her to. Why didn't you just message Avery yourself? Didn't know what your mother had told you. Didn't know, what you thought of me. Things aren't always as they seem. [sobbing] So, what do you both do now that you're so grown up? Lou's a hairdresser. I-- I'm not doing anything right now. Both still live at home? Moved out a few years ago. I saw Avery got married, yeah? He seems nice. She got any kids? No. Ah, I'm sure she'll be a good mother when the time comes. She was always good with you younger kids. Did your mother ever meet anyone? We're not going to talk about Mom. Okay. What do you want to talk about? Where have you been? What have you been doing? Moved around a lot. Moved where the work is. Spent a bit of time in Newcastle. We-- we used to holiday there. I-- I lived near that park with the flying fox. You remember that? [chuckles] Avery fell off, and cracked her head open, screamed her lungs out. -That was me. -No, that was Avery. It was me. Anyway, moved back to Sydney a few years ago. Lived in Cronulla for a while, and then-- Yeah. Moved to Kogarah a few months back. Do you have any other kids? Nah. Not that I'm aware of. But you never know. [Mark slurping] You're a quiet kid, hey? Guess that's what comes from living in a house full of women. Never let you get a word in edgewise, huh? -You got a girlfriend? -No. [Mark] Ah. Oh, well, it's no hurry. Your mother and I were in a hurry. But, uh, you're still so young. What about you, heh? Bet the boys go crazy for you. I'm gay. Oh. Okay. I can't imagine that comes as a surprise to you. What do you mean? I mean the time that you caught Sasha and I. -I don't-- -What, you don't remember? Maybe you were drunk. It was a really special day for me. -[Mark] I wasn't drunk. -Oh, what, so you do remember? If you're talking about what I think you're talking about, then yeah, I was strict on you, kids. My dad was strict on me. I believe discipline is important. Your mother and I had very different parenting styles. Bet she let you get away with murder after I left. So, why did you finally leave? Well, I didn't just leave. Did she tell you that I just left? [scoffs] She told me to go. I mean, she was telling me... to go. -She told you to go? -Yeah. Obviously, I didn't think it'd be 15 years until I saw you again. Some of that... probably my fault. The longer something's left, the harder it is to approach, you know? We all do things we believe are right... at the time. I'm going to go get another. You sure I can't get you anything? [footsteps departing] This is fucked. He doesn't look like his pictures. Lou? Never looked like his pictures to me. Let's just go. I don't know what I thought. Yeah, look, you were curious. You know, I was curious. He's not sorry. Barely even noticed that we were gone. Is there anything else that you want to know? There's no point. Ta. [Mark grunts] -Got some chips for the table. -Look, I have to go. What, you have to go now? I didn't know this was on. So, I've got a thing. Well, are y-- you going to stay? [Rio] She's my ride. Look, I'm sorry if this hasn't gone the way-- How did you think this was going to go? What did you think was going to happen? I didn't know. I'd love to see you guys again. Give my love to Avery. [door creaks open] [Avery] Lou. What happened? Why couldn't you leave it? Why couldn't you just fucking leave it? -Leave what? -Leave this! Leave all of this. Why couldn't you just leave it in the past? Why did you have to dredge it all up? What? We were fine before this happened. We didn't need it, but you, you had to fuck it up. -Were you fucking bored? -I didn't know. What didn't you know? We told you everything. What? Did you think we were lying? Didn't you believe us? What did you-- Did you think there was some big cover up to keep you from a great and loving father? -I had to know for myself. -Oh, well, now you do. Now you know. -There was nothing... -[fists thudding] -...there. -[Avery] Lou, enough! It would have been nice to have a dad. That's what you were thinking, it would've been nice to have a dad, right? I know. I know. It would have been nice. It would have been nice, well, can you fucking grow up now? [shouting] Fuck you. This is my fucking house. It's not yours anymore, you can't-- You can't just come back and-- and yell at me like-- I'm not a kid. I'm not-- I'm not your kid. I'm not s-- I'm not some fucking nuisance! You treat me like-- [Rio panting] I'm an adult. -This is my house. -It's not your house. It's Mom's house and you're a spoiled brat. I'm the-- I'm the brat? I'm the one that needs to grow up? -Yeah. -Have you looked in the mirror lately, huh? You are pathetic. You are the most selfish fucking fuck-- What am I? Spit it out, Rio! Fucking say it. Stop. We cannot speak to each other like this. How are we supposed to talk to each other then? [sighs] I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but this is-- this is the most we've spoken to each other in years. So, I'm-- I think I'm still getting used to it. Yeah, but it's been good though, hasn't it? Being here together. We're the only ones who know. What the hell are you talking about? We are the only people who know what it was like. People talk about found families. I've never found a family outside of this one. You have Daniel. I don't. I have-- I have Mum and I have you two. You know, when... He was gone... I felt like... we didn't need to be as close. So I didn't try. I really regret all of this distance between us. Sorry. Lou. I'm sorry. ♪ I didn't mean it. I know, me neither. I've got to get out of here. She told him to leave. Did you know that? Did he say that? Well, do you believe him? Why would she just tell him to go after all that time? I guess enough was enough. Are you okay? It's not your fault. You weren't wrong to want to know. I have to get something to eat. Hey, um, I'm going to be back. -Where are you going? -I'll just go to the shops. Do you need anything? Uh... milk.
