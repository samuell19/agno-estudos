- Yeah! - Violet called me. You want the police up in here knockin' on your door next? If you're gonna shoot me, get it over with. - Lena! - That's that shit I gotta deal with. I'm here, honey. Look, do you have another room? - I don't sit here and watch her fuck. - Just go there, and I'll be there in a minute. - You gonna get my bitch out the bathroom? - That's why I'm here. - All right. 103. - Violet? He's gone now. What happened? - This trick, he put some weird shit on his balls. So I said, what is that shit? He said, don't worry about it. I said, fuck yeah I'm gonna worry about it. So he goes and tells Ronnie. Ronnie gets mad, 'cause I embarrassed the customer. And he hits me. - All right. You just wait here, all right? - Bitch ready to go back to work? - Actually, she wants to come with me. - Fuck that. - Come on, you and me both know, forcing a girl to stay in this-- - Bitch chose up. She can make her money. - But this is just the start. You keep her here like this, she's just gonna run off more and more money. You really want a underage bitch who ain't 100% with it working for you? - Said she was 18. - Nigger, did she show you some ID? Look, you thinkin' about this all wrong. You could keep here if you want to, but what happens when next time she don't call me? - These girls can't just come and go. - I know. - Ain't no fuckin' temp agency. - I know. - You know what I gotta do, right? - Yeah, and that's fine. - You want out? You better say something ho. You got this bitch to come get you. - Lena! - Don't be coming up here, and taking my girls. You got that? - Got it. - You got that? - Got it. - Go ahead bitch, leave. But don't be calling me when you ain't got nowhere to go because they kicked your ass out. I helped you, and you're gonna turn on me. Get the fuck out of here, you square bitch. Go! - You okay? - You okay? - I'll do what I have to do to get a girl out. - This is good. I thought you'd be all Marvin Gaye, or something. - How old do you think I am? - I'm saying like, attitude. You got that 70's Soul Train, or Foxy Brown, 'tude. - Okay, I can live with that. A girl came to my house, she got into music production. This is one of the projects she worked on. It's just some indie stuff. - Cool. I was gonna be a singer. - Really? Let me hear something. ♪ Yeah yeah yeah ♪ - You have a really nice voice. - Thanks. - Look, not to get all up in your business but singing's a real possibility. You just gotta decide how long you're gonna spend making somebody else a star instead of yourself. - Quit smiling. that's dumb. - Looks bad, looks bad. Oh, you know Justin wants to meet tomorrow after ballet. - Have you even seen him? - Yeah, of course. We Skype all the time, and I don't know, he's such a cutie. Don't tell anybody I told you. - But I think you should tell your mom. - I mean, he's a senior. - So you're not gonna tell her because of that? - I don't know, it's not like even a real date. - Yes it is. That's a date. You're going on a date. - Okay okay, well, she won't let me have a boyfriend, so what else can I do? Go ahead, what can I do? Nothing. - Dani? - Yeah, Mom. - Hey. It's time for bed. - But it's Friday. - And you know that you have ballet first thing in the morning. - Yeah, and then piano in the afternoon, and then swimming on Sundays. - I gotta go anyway, so. Sorry. - Bye. - Thank you Miss Walker. - Bye babe. - Bye. - How's it going? - Just that I have to finish up this last diagram. - Need any help? - No, I'm okay. - Well, what is it? - Just AP chemistry. - Well, I can tell you I would be zero help to you in that, my dear. I am so proud of you. And I know that your father is-- - Mom. Thank you. - Okay. Okay. Goodnight baby. - Goodnight. - Police received an anonymous call about a body burning, right here they say, on 94th Street and Broadway. When police arrived, they believed the victim to be female, but the body has not yet been identified. People in the community-- - That's Nicki. - Oh my God, that's Nicki. - That's Nicki. - Oh my God! - Hey, what is going on? - Dominick, he did that! - Nicki's pimp put a green light on her. Burned her alive right on the street in front of everybody. - I know that girl, they're coming for me next. - Look look, nobody is coming for you. Everybody just relax. Calm down, what are you even doing, looking at the computer, you know the rules about looking at the computer. - I'm sorry, it's my fault. I said it was okay. - He's got friends, and Lena I'm scared. - Hey don't be scared, look at me. If Lena's got you, nobody is coming for you. Listen, all of you are gonna be okay. I am here. - Let's get you settled, okay? - Just calm down. - I'm Crystal. - I got you. You're all right. - So this is where you'll be staying. It gets a little warm here at night, so sometimes we like to leave the window open. You know this is the scar that got me out of the life. You know the night that I got this scar, I threw myself down on my knees in my room and I just, I prayed, I didn't even know who I as praying to but, I prayed for a way out. And, a week later, that's when I met Lena. And I've been here ever since. But what about you? What'd your pimp promise you? - My situation's a little bit different, because we're actually in a relationship. Yeah, right now we're just having some problems. - I see. - Dani? - What? - I'm Justin's homeboy. He's running a little late. He told me to come swoop you up, and take you to the mall. - No, I'm sorry. - Dani, I'm home early, wanna get lunch? Dani? Dani? Dani? Hey Dani, it's your mom. I got home early from work, thought maybe we could go to our favorite lunch spot, but you're not here. Just wondering where you are. And give me a call back please, sooner than later. All right, I love you. Hi, this is Sharon, I'm Dani's Mom, a friend of Haley's. Hi, I'm sorry to bother you. Is Haley around? Haley? Hi, it's Sharon. Yeah hi, I was wondering, have you seen Dani, or is she with you? I can't find her anywhere, and I really need to talk to her. You're saying she never went to dance class today? Haley, I need you tell me exactly the last place that you saw her. Hold on. Who the hell is Justin? - Get your black ass in here. This fuckin' bitch bit me. Something funny? - Like I was paying cash-- - Bitch, don't you ever take me as a goddamn joke, you hear me? - Yes, daddy. - What? I say call me king master daddy. - Yes, king master daddy. - Now what the fuck is going on? What did I tell you about touching my girls? - That bitch was out of line. - What did I tell you about calling them bitches? How come I have to keep repeating myself, you dumb fuck? - I can't calm down Mom, the police said there's nothing they can do for 24 hours. 24 hours! I could have killed them for suggesting teenage girls run off with their boyfriends all the time. That is not Dani. It's not her. Mom, I'll call you back, okay? - My boyfriend gave me an iPhone, and a TV. Sometimes we'd just sit in my room all day and watch cartoons. We didn't mess around or nothin', it'd just be the two of us. - He gave 'em to you? - Well, I think they were a loan. But we all gotta earn our keep. - I'm just saying, it ain't a gift if it's a loan. - I guess. - Did you have to work to pay it off? How long did it take for you to pay it off? - Well, we gotta pay for the phone bill, too. And for the cable. - I'm not judging you. I am you. I'm all of you. I was on the track just like you, and now we're all here. I'm just trying to point out that this is how they sometimes keep control over you. They'll give you things, or buy you things, real nice things, but then they set it up to where you can't never pay it off, and that's how they own you. And that ain't love. Ownership ain't love. I know you all thing your boyfriends ain't scared of nothing, that they invincible. But you all are the ones out there on the track, every night, risking your bodies and your freedom, your lives. So who's the real coward? Pimp's only scared of two things, losing his money. - Hell yeah. - Right? 'Cause they sure be standing outside that motel room waiting on you to come and get that money first. They scared of losing their money, and life in the penitentiary, 'cause you can't pimp in the penitentiary. Think about it. We have more power than we know. - So there's a lady here to see you. - Can you take over? - Yeah. - What are you doing here? - I thought-- - How'd you even know I was here? - Dani's missing. - Dani? The goddaughter that I've been banned from ever seeing again? - She was talking to this older man online, and then they met up, and now I can't find her anywhere, and I am so scared that something, I thought maybe you could help that, you might know something about-- - Of course, yeah, 'cause a high school ho would know where your teenage daughter ran off to, right? - No Lena, I need your help, please. - And I needed you too. Now if you'll excuse me, I actually have work to do. - Here, take these. They'll make you feel better. Oh baby, what? No no no no. Look at that face. Look at your beautiful eyes. They're drying up anyway. Like sunshine. - Who are you? Where is Justin? - I'm Eve baby. And I'm Justin, too. I'm the only thing you'll ever need. Come on, mama. Take the pills. Come on. There you go. Good girl, good girl. Come here, mama. I got you. - Bitch, give me the money shot. Shoot that ass up, tricks like that shit. - Come here baby, come. This is where you'll be sleeping tonight. - Violet, do you know who Harriet Tubman is? - Yeah, the lady who freed all the slaves. - Right. You know she said she could have freed a thousand more, if only they'd known they were slaves. - I'm not going back to him. - Goodnight, Violet. Thank you. - You're welcome. Seven times, right? - Yeah, we only have to put with this five more times before she stops trying to go back. - Miss Lena? Do you know why I decided to stay here? It's because you said that you would never leave a girl behind. Ain't a lot of people that would do that for us. ♪ Oh baby ♪ ♪ There's a heaviness ♪ ♪ And it's weighing down on me ♪ ♪ I know you feel it ♪ - I filed the report, and the officer told me to just keep my phone near me and wait. - It takes 48 hours to turn a girl out. - What? - Just show me her room. - Hey. Thank you for helping me. - I'm not helping you. I'm helping Dani. - What are you looking for? Dani is a good kid. - The girls in my house are very creative. - She never hides anything from me. - Don't freak out, it's just a journal. Justin her boyfriend? - No. Justin is the guy that she was talking to online. - Show me. - You hungry? Eve said to feed you. Bitch, get the fuck up. - I'm not gonna do it, what you girls do. - Look, Eve don't like no talk back. Eat. - They can't make me. - That's what they all say here. - But what about your families? - What family? This is our family. King master daddy takes us to get our nails done, our hair done, and he take us to get burgers, bitch. All I got at the house is my mama's boyfriend trying to fuck me. Later for that shit. - Can I have some more water, please? - Bitch, do we look like the maids? - Get your own fucking water. What the fuck is wrong with that white ho? - She thinks she better than us. - She better fall in line. - Whoa whoa, hey. Where do you think we're going, some red carpet event? - I still have mine, too. - Yeah? - What the hell are you doing? - Relaxing. Shit. - I'm a nurse Lena, and I can tell you right now that shit's not good for you. - Well I'm a user, Sharon, and I can tell you that it is. - Where are we going? - I'll stay here. - Okay. Hey, Woody around? - Who the fuck are you? - Lena, Peanut. I used to run with Woody back in the day. - So wait, you one of his ex-bitches? - No. - Yeah, you got that snitch jacket on you, bitch. So wait, think you can come around here, asking motherfuckers where they at? You know, snitches get stitches. Or did your ass forget that? Man, step the fuck off. - Oh la. Who wants the Wood? I got this. How you doing Peanut? Long time. Or should I call you Lena, now? Since you went all straight on me, and shit. You never said goodbye. - I know, but that wasn't about you. I had issues. - Fuck, I had issues. So you go and take up with the motherfucker that put you out on the track selling your ass? Anyway, I already got paperwork on your ass. Baby girl, this whole conversation could be going through the wires right now. - Ain't no paperwork on me, Woody. And I ain't wearing a wire. - How I know that? - What that mean? - Yeah. - Take that shit off, girl. - Hold it, what the fuck's so funny? What you all looking at? You proved your point. What you want? - There's a girl, she's been snatched. She's only 15, but she's special to me. - That ain't my motherfuckin' concern, we look like we kidnap girls around here? That's some cracker shit. - It don't feel like that though. He used the internet, but this feels like some street shit, Woody. - You know what they say about streets, right? The streets is dangerous. It ain't like it used to be, Peanut. These young boys be talkin'. Drugs you sell once. But bitches, you sell over and over and over. - Can you help me? Woody, please? Please Woody? - All right, look, I know this gorilla pimp, he's got two young girls in his stable. He be on that internet bullshit you talkin' about. - Where is he? - Over there in south park.

Better not be that fake shit. Okay okay, hey bitch, get here, come get this money. - Hey man, what the fuck is this? I heard you had young females up in here. - Oh, they young. See I stay away from all that freak shit. - But you know about it, right? You do your biz online. - The fuck you know about my business? Yeah, I got this new app, what about it? - So you know somebody who recruits and sells young girls online or not? - Kidnaps young girls online. - Fuck, is you all the police? - I'm a mother. - I got a mom, I feel you, I feel you. Hey hey hey bitch, remember that motherfucker that was all fuckin' about money and shit? Didn't want to fuck that nigger up. Yeah, I know that bitch-ass nigger Qwan, fuck that nigger. - Qwan? - That's all the fuck I can tell you. - That's cool. Thanks man. - Bitch, count that money. - What's up, Derrick? What's up with this nigger named Qwan? I heard the girls around this area, he's got some young girls, you know anything about that? - No, I don't. - You know anybody who does? - No, baby girl, I don't. - All right, thanks. - Hey girl, how you doing? - I'm good, I'm looking for a nigger named Qwan. You know anything about that? - Qwan? - Yeah. - Around here? - Yeah. - Got a cigarette? - Here. My boy says Qwan stays somewhere around here. There's a particular ho I'm looking for. He said Qwan might know where she is. So you don't know nobody who knows Qwan? Anything like that, anything that could get me to help? - I don't know no nigger named Qwan. - I figure we can find out who some of Qwan's girls are over here. 12 to two, those are the hot hours. - Hot hours? - It's when the businessmen go to lunch, and they ain't just trollin' for fast food. That's one of them over there. - She doesn't look like one of them. - What does one of them look like? I mean obviously they'd look like me. But they can also be cute and blonde. - What is this about, Lena? You showed up to my daughter's ninth birthday party high as hell, and I didn't know how to deal with your shit anymore. I'd been taking care of you since high school, you running off for days, high, out of your mind, and you wanted me to do the same thing while raising a child? - No, I wanted you to not turn your back on me. - Oh, don't act like you were a fucking angel, Lena. You were in the goddamn streets. - And you're so perfect, right? You got all these extracurricular activities, and all these fancy-ass clubs and instructors who are spending more time with Dani, than you are. - Fuck you, Lena. - That's right, Sharon. Fuck me. - Your man Ronnie, right? - Yeah. - Heard he got a new moneymaker. - So? - Just saying. Heard she might be pregnant, too. - Where are you going? - I'm not about this square-ass life. - Hey, you know there's nothing out there for you. - I miss him. - You didn't give it a chance. Please, don't go. - Oh shit. - What is it, Lena? Tell me, what is it? Tell me. Oh, oh my God. - We're gonna find her. - She's top of the line, ho. Yeah. Never been touched. Okay. Cool. We good. Now we just gotta turn this bitch out. - You know what hurt my feelings, Sunshine? You trying to run away from me. I thought you were mine. - Fuck you. - Fuck me? Fuck you. Fuck you, your fucking mother don't give a shit about you. She's never gonna find you. Her working all the time. She doesn't know how you feel, how you felt after your daddy died. You know who does? Justin. Justin knows everything. And sooner or later, you're gonna realize that I'm the only one who truly loves you. - It's gonna be okay. Listen to me. I've been on this track before. These pictures don't mean it's too late. We can actually use them as clues. Right? Look, this is all code. They say she's 18, but you can tell how old she really is by counting the hearts. I know who's got her. Eve. We had the same pimp back in the day. - So you could just talk to her, right? - It's not like we're on the best of terms. I was Killer P's bottom bitch. That made Eve crazy. - You you know where they are. You know where to find them, right? - Look, believe it or not, there are rules to this, and Eve doesn't exactly play by those rules. - No no no, look there has to be something. There has to be something. You know the codes. You know how this works. I know it's sick but, can't we just set it up to buy her. I just want my daughter back. - No. It's too dangerous. Okay look, there might be a better way. It's a long shot but I'm still in contact with her girl, Marcie. - Marcie might know where she is? - I hope so. - Lena, leave before I call the cops. - I just want some information, Cesar. - You crazy, bitch. - It's not gonna take long. - Get out. - I just want to know where Marcie is. - Fuck you. - Actually looks like you fucked her. Why don't you tell me where Marcie is, and that way I don't have to call the police and tell 'em you're paying for pussy? - Excuse me? Get the fuck out of here. - Okay. But first why don't I call Nancy. She should like to know what kind of freaky shit her husband is involved in. - How much you want to keep your trap closed? - I don't want money. - Well that's a first. - Where's Marcie? - Haven't seen her in months. Why? - That's my business. - Studio City, I can't afford her ass anymore. - Are you sure this is the right place? - Can I help you? - Marcie called me. - Really? - It's about a panic attack coming on, and she forgot her meds, so she called me to bring 'em. - I suggest you get out of here. - Look, she really needs these meds that I've got. - Now. Go. Hey, putsch, she can bring. You, I watch you. Come. - Hey quit playing. - Come into home. Go to the left. You are best friend? - No. Marcie? Can you hear me? Wake up, where's Eve? Eve, sit up honey, I need your help. Where's Eve? Eve. - Fuck Eve. That bitch threw me away. She said I was too old to make her money. Do I look fuckin' old? - No, no you don't. Just tell us where she is. - She had a new bitch. - I knew I don't trust you. - No no no, we just need a little information, please. That's all. - You, I think I trust. But you? I don't like you. Get the fuck out. - Okay, we're gonna go. - No no no, she stay. She stays here. - You know what? You don't want her with you. She doesn't have any skills. I'm good. - You try to fuck me, you fuck my business. - I'm the one with the skills, leave her out of it. - I don't want you, nigitch. - Down, down. Down. Down. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - That bitch gets her drugs from cardiac doc, the Richmond location. Tell her Marcie said, ha. - Richmond. I think I know where that is. - Sunshine, you're special. I haven't had an offer like that in years. Sunshine here, she's gonna be a big moneymaker, you mark my words. Yeah. Hey Jas, the pickup's ready. Give me attitude, honey. Bottom bitch. Hey, come on. Give me your hands, it's time to give thanks. Come on Sunshine, hold my hand. We're gonna get you on. God, we thank you so much, for bringing our family together over this table. For Sunshine, thank you this blessing Lord. You keep her safe and you keep her strong, and may your angels carry her every step of the way. You bless her, and you give her your almighty protection. May that money flow to this house whole, with gold, with so much blessing that will overflow these doors and these windows. Lord keep these sisters united, and keep them strong. Thank you, Lord. - Damn, I missed you baby. - I missed you too. - So sexy. I got you something. I'm gonna go get it. Happy early birthday. - For me? - And I also got you a recording session, I set one up. I got a music producer coming in. He's gonna sit in and listen to that beautiful voice. - Really? - Right, what did I tell you? - Thank you. Thank you. - All right, I want to see how tight it is on you. - Beautiful. - Try it on. - It's pretty but, it's kind of short. - It's a work dress. - Work? - Recording studios cost money baby. Dreams don't come cheap. - I thought it could be different this time. - You know, we're in love. But we all gotta work. Whoa, whoa whoa. Get up. You're not gonna need these. - You can't get in here. - Where's Eve? - Who? - Eve. - I don't know who that is. - Okay. How about now? 'Cause a little birdie told me that she likes to buy drugs, and you like to sell 'em to her. - I know who she is, but I don't know where she is. - Okay, let's try this a different way. - Now, once I insert this needle into your external jugular, this succinylcholine is gonna stop your heart, but slowly, because for seven long minutes you're gonna enjoy the tight unbearable constriction of your failing heart. Now you have three options. She can cut you, and you'll bleed out. I can stick this needle in your neck, and in seven minutes you'll be dead, or you can tell us where the fuck Eve is. You got anything to say. - I'll tell you everything. She's on the way. - Remember when I got my license? Drove us up to Mulholland in that shitty old car, watched the sunset. That was nice. - Yeah, and then your car broke down. My dad was so mad at us. He was like, if I wanted you to go joyriding I would have left you with your mom. - You know your father still lives in the neighborhood? - I heard. - You were right about Dani. I should spend more time with her. - Don't do that. Don't beat yourself up, it's not gonna help. You did the best you could. Better than my mom and dad. Probably better than yours, too. Saint Maria Goretti. Forgiveness, that's why she's there, to remind me. - Sister Mary always said, when you forgive, you in no way change the past, but you sure do change what's to come. That was one mean old lady. - Yeah, but she knew what she was talking about. - You know what I want, Runway? I want you to make my Sunshine pretty. - Let's go. - Where the fuck is that bitch? - That's gotta be her. That must be the house, right there. Sharon. - Where's my daughter? - Bitch, who the fuck are you? Gonna fuck you up, bitch. - And I'm gonna fuck you up, bitch. Get off of her. Go. - Lena. - Dani? - Aren't you that bitch in the streets playing captain save-a-ho? - Shut up. - What you come back for? You wanna suck some dick, bitch? - Shut up! - Nobody's here. - Where's Dani? - The new bitch? She's getting turned the fuck out, right now. Eve got her ass at your old stomping grounds off Ventura. Yeah, bitch. - Lena? Lena come on, we got it. Let's go. - The fuck you waiting on? Not that one, that one. Yeah. That's the one. First time is always the hardest. It's game time, let's go. Now! - You look nice. Sweet. - Lena, we gotta go. We really gotta go. So what happens now? - Look, it's gonna be easier if I go by myself, so you just stay here, and I'm gonna go find the room, okay? - We came all this way, and you expect me to just wait here? - Just trust me, please. - Come back with my girl. - Room service. - Room service. - Room service. - Room service. - Got the money? What the fuck is that, bitch? Where's my stuff? You don't hold out your dumb bitch. - Now what's the matter, pretty cheerleader? Huh? So soft. - Room service. - Do not disturb. - Room service. - Jesus. - Room service. - I said no room service. Okay. - Get the fuck out of here. - I'm going. - Dani? Hey, it's me. It's Lena, I'm here to help you. I'm gonna take you home. - No, no, God what did you just do? Now she's gonna hurt me, she's gonna find me, and she's gonna hurt me. - No, nobody's gonna find you, no one is gonna hurt you, I promise. Nobody is gonna hurt you, okay?
