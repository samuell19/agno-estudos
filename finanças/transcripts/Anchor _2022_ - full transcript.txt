It's a system where the government provides a certain amount of money to support them. Mom, haven't you seen enough? Did you pronounce it a bit awkwardly yesterday? No, I didn't. And why are the clothes so dark? I told you to wear brighter colours. You said before that the anchor was wearing too much light colour. That it would interfere with the news. But you can't be the only one wearing darker colours. Although you are currently on a successful run, you can't take it lightly. It's only a matter of time before someone gets on top of you. Mom, please. Of course my daughter is the best. Honestly, who else could host the 9:00 news right now? Who else but you? Hello, sir. Hello, seniors. Hi, how are you? How are you? How are you?

End of news That's it for the news. Thank you. Good job. Thank you all for your hard work. Thank you for your hard work. Thank you for your hard work. What's wrong with Jung Se Ra today? She's stuttering. At last, a little bit of human emotion. How could such a mistake happen? What will people say? Didn't the director say anything? It's about to be over. How can you be so relaxed? Do you have something on your mind? Did Min's son-in-law come to see you again? No, not at all. That's why I told you to get rid of it early. It'll hinder your career. Before the live news just now, I received a strange report. I was told to go over there and pick it up immediately. She said her daughter was dead. It was all a bunch of nonsense. It was a prank call. But the call was very concerning to me. What if the woman was telling the truth? I'd have to tell someone. Didn't I ask you to get the material? Yes. Sera, Mom thinks this is your chance. A chance to be a real anchor. A real anchor? Are you going to read like a parrot forever? We're almost there. Anyone? I'm from YBC News. Excuse me. I'm from YBC News. Is anyone there? This is Yoon Mi-soo's house, right? Are you in there? Sera-senpai. When was the last time you saw them? I haven't seen them this month. Did anyone come looking for the Yoon and her daughter? I don't know about that. Hey, anchor Jung. Are you going to write it yourself? Now you're a journalist. Did you find out anything? Not yet. Or maybe it was suicide. No, when she called me, She clearly said someone had broken into her house. Her mood sounded very unstable. In a state of complete fear. As if someone had shown up. That will come out after the investigation. Officer Kim, you need to come in and take a look. Oh, I'll be right there. Excuse me, please. There's a lot of discussion about the death of the mother and daughter in Jicheon-dong. There is a lot of discussion about the deaths of the mother and daughter in Jicheon-dong. Was it an extreme choice? Or was it a murder disguised as a suicide? The police are continuing their investigation. Let's take a look at the first eyewitness to the case. The first eyewitness account of the case was taken by anchor Jung Se-Ra herself. At 2:00 a.m. on the 18th. A mother in her 20s and her 5-year-old daughter were found dead in a complex in Jichuan-dong, Seoul. The bodies of a mother in her 20s and her 5-year-old daughter were found The mother, Yoon, who was in her twenties Strangled to death in her bedroom The body of her 5-year-old daughter was found in the bathroom The bodies were submerged in the bathtub Yoon, a mother who raised her daughter alone To focus on parenting, She even took time off from school Loved and cared for her only daughter She loved her daughter very much. She also told me that she lived for her daughter It was a suicide. Or was there a connection to a third party crime? That was the direction of the investigation from then on. The police investigating this case are considering the possibility of a murder disguised as a suicide. In order to unravel the real cause of death The National Institute of Scientific Investigation was commissioned to conduct an autopsy. This is YBC News' Jung Se Ra. Yoon's last call to YBC News. She reported her daughter's death directly to anchor Jung Se Ra. That's right. Yoon told me that someone broke into her house. She told me that someone had broken into her house and would soon come to kill her. Yoon wanted to tell the YBC 9:00 news about her urgent situation. That's why we're so sorry about Yoon's death. That's why we're going to reveal to our viewers We'd like to release part of the conversation between anchor Jung Se Ra and Yoon. Before the 9pm news last night Last night before the 9:00 pm news Yoon, who called YBC News She said it was urgent to report something. Looking for anchor Jung Se-Ra. There's a man who usually stares at me and my daughter. He threatened us. Where is he now? He's not here now. But it feels like he'll be back soon I'm so scared Hello? This is going to be a good response. I'll report it to the police department there first. They'll be there soon. Even if I die, I will be acknowledged by the anchor, Jung Se-Ra. I think I'd be very happy to have my death reported by anchor Jung Se-Ra. I think I'll be very happy. I always wanted to be like you, sister. You'll come, won't you, sister? I'm sorry to hear that Yoon's phone call There was an overwhelming fan mentality in Yoon's call It's hard not to suspect that it's a prank call. Hello? Hello, Sister? Are you there? Sorry, you can't call as a prank. What? - No. No, it's not that, sis. I was really scared, that's why I did it. That guy... I'll hang up now. He killed my daughter. I've told you everything. Okay, I'll hang up. Yes, yes. Jung Se Ra. I'll probably have to take calls about you all night. Jung Se Ra is still number one on the Hot 100. That... The way that woman died. It always comes back to me. Is it because I spoke to her directly on the phone? Did you see her face? No, I didn't. What? Don't you know the unwritten rules of our business? You have to see her face when you're in a situation like this. Otherwise it always comes back to you. When I went to pick up a traffic accident, A young woman's neck was broken and she was dead at the wheel. I couldn't look at her face. And then what happened? It still comes back to me now. Why are you still here at this time of night? You're here. I was looking for something. Yeah. The China thing. We've decided to invest $50 million. We've already achieved our results last year. We should get a dividend this year. Good thing, right? It's a good thing. Once this fund project is over Let's get back together I thought we agreed to have a good life together, right? While we still have time to get pregnant. Let's have a good life like everyone else. I'm in the middle of a rewrite period. Didn't we say we wouldn't talk about getting pregnant first? So you even went to the show? I'm sure your mother told you to go again. What did you say? You look tired. I'm going. Oh, yeah. You know about the couples' party, right? Don't forget. According to police sources, they suspect that it was The killer who strangled the child to confuse the time of death. The possibility of putting the body in the bathtub Thanks to the timely detection of YBC anchor Jung Se Ra. It should be possible to deduce the approximate time of death. Okay, questions about the death of the mother and daughter. Hello. We haven't solved it yet. Se Ra is really something, isn't she? The next piece of information is... Minister Koh? Yes, sir. Our new program is... How about the death of a mother and daughter in Jicheon-dong instead? But reporter Seo has prepared some content. Put it aside and do this first. When we meet later, Jung Se Ra will join us. Okay. It's going to be a busy day with the release of the case. I understand. I'm busy right now. Detective Kim, how's the investigation going? I thought you said we'd release the case later. Did you get the autopsy results? Is it related to the child's father? No, or it was a lover. Well, since I'm a fan of yours, I'll tell you. But you can't reveal anything until we release the case. Don't worry. She killed herself. She killed herself around 9:00 p.m. after talking to you on the phone. What? There's no sign of anyone breaking in. She dropped out of school after having her baby. And she cut herself off from her family. Even her family didn't know who her husband was. And the baby was... Because Yoon's choking of her daughter didn't go well. The police believe that she drowned her daughter by throwing her into the bathtub The police eventually concluded that she had drowned her daughter by throwing her into the bathtub Normally, Yoon suffered from mental illness Extremely pessimistic about her life and decided to join her daughter in her quest for death The initial suspicion of The death was caused by the involvement of a third party... Okay, anchor ready. Why didn't she go straight home? I really didn't think she'd kill herself. Are you okay? I just feel a little sad. The world won't change if you feel sorry for them. She killed her own child in cold blood. It's a homicide. Take it easy. She called me herself before she died. So you have to be extra careful too. Once you're pregnant, all your accomplishments are lost. Why are you talking about that now? It's bad. If you keep reporting the truth. It's not going to be the talk of the town. We need to take better chances. That's all you have to think about. So this is the way to do it. "After reporting on the suicide of a single mother with her child After reporting on the hopelessness" To win the attention of the audience Anchor Jung. Didn't you go to the interview yourself and have nothing to say? Actually, I don't know if this case I don't know if it's worth looking at with pity This is a single mother who found life difficult And she killed her own child. And yet the public still feels compassion for this case. She was a single mother who had never been cared for by her family or neighbours. It's common knowledge that she had a mental illness. That is, because she was an unwed mother and mentally ill. Is it more important to look at her with compassion? That is to say that we should be more understanding of her behaviour I also agree with Minister Xu's opinion Shouldn't we first focus on the difficulties in life that the single mother's family is going through We should change our perspective before considering the difficulties of life. If we look at the facts of the case The mother killed her daughter and then committed suicide. Do you mean to define it as a case of a mother killing her child? What are you saying? So, Jung Se-Ra... You're the one who got the call to report her. You're too indifferent, aren't you? Killing someone and then committing suicide? That's more realistic. Okay. Commissioner. It's okay for the media to be indifferent. Then you can decide for yourself this time, Jung Se Ra. At my own discretion? Use this momentum to your advantage. I have high hopes for you. I understand. Okay. So, next topic. I'm here. Where are you? I'm sorry. Give me ten minutes. I'm late for work. Yeah, okay. Who are you? You're not a thief. How can you break into someone's house without permission? You didn't touch anything in there, did you? Moved... what did you move? I'm not going to get arrested, am I? You should ask him. I just came to check for signs of her symptoms. After all, there was a claim that I misdiagnosed her during the last investigation. You can't say you're responsible for that, can you? Anyway, I see. You can go. Wait a minute. If you can. I'd like to know more about Yoon Mi-soo's symptoms. And what were you looking for? I don't think I'm the only real thief. I'm here to follow up on the interview. I'm sorry. According to hospital rules, I can't tell you about the patient's condition. Is it okay if you let him go like this? He's related to Yoon Mi-soo, right? When we investigated, we found no record of him talking to Yoon Mi-soo. There's no sign of him entering her house. But it's strange. Why did the doctor come to the victim's house? The day before Yoon Mi-soo died. She went to Dr. Choi's hospital to see him. According to him, She wanted to stop treatment, but he couldn't persuade her. So he let her go. That's why I thought something was strange. I don't know. There's been cases like this before. I think it's a bit weird too. The case The building you're looking at is Choi's hospital. A., who was in her 20s, was treated here yesterday. He jumped out of the window of the clinic and died. The police arrested Choi, a neuropsychiatrist, as a matter of urgency and investigated what happened during the treatment. So what happened during the treatment? No one knows for sure. Because there was no evidence, the case was closed as a suicide by jumping from a building. It wasn't a problem that occurred during surgery. There's no way to pursue medical negligence. Besides, it wasn't the first time the patient had attempted suicide. Don't mention it. At the time we were heavily criticized for saying that the doctor was also a victim. But the public opinion framed the doctor as a murderer. But he was the doctor who treated Yoon Mi-soo. Take it easy. I want to go home. I want to go home. I want to go home. I'm afraid I don't have much time left. This week's episode of Anchor View I'm going to show the murder of Michelle Yoon. I know it's presumptuous. But there are a few things that need to be asked. Do you think schizophrenia was a direct cause of this case? When something like this happens. When something like this happens, people usually find out why before they feel comfortable. Wasn't she on medication? She had already been diagnosed with schizophrenia in other hospitals. And she had little faith in the treatment. When she came to see me, she said she'd been diagnosed. She wanted me to just prescribe her medication. I heard she came to see you at the hospital the day before the murder. She said she was doing better after treatment She said she didn't want to be treated for the rest of her life. Sometimes she came to see me out of the blue during hospital hours. That's a bit odd. So you went to her house in person to look for something? Didn't I make that clear the other day? What else do you want to know? You said you wanted to find a clue to the symptoms, right? So did you find anything about the person she mentioned? Well... Everyone has someone, right? As an excuse to deny what you've done. Who knows? That person might come to you. About the patient who died ten years ago. Will there be that person too? Some patients can't handle the pain they encounter. Some patients can't cope with the pain they're experiencing. That is, they think that suicide is the only way to help them. It's the only way to help you get out of it. You look like you have no conscience at all. Can I give you a sedative if you need one? What? There are good drugs now. Almost no side effects. I've been taking them occasionally. Cheer up. Not long ago, a mother killed her child and then committed suicide in Jicheonju-dong. The case of a mother who killed her child and then committed suicide It caused an uproar in the community Today, in the anchor view We invited Professor Han Young-ok, a professor of social psychology to discuss this case in depth. The case of the death of a mother and daughter in Jicheon-dong In the case of the death of a mother and daughter in Jicheon-dong The so-called suicide by association is inappropriate. This is a clear case of suicide after the murder of her daughter. Yes, it is. A person cannot be a partner in the death of another person, right? Yes. Because it cannot be seen as a daughter voluntarily ending her life. Parents may think it's out of a sense of responsibility for their children. In fact, they are not able to distinguish between themselves and their children There is a lack of understanding that children have a life of their own. Lack of awareness that children have a life of their own This awareness So? According to statistics Of those who kill their children and then commit suicide The overwhelming proportion of mothers is a cause for concern It is alarming that A high percentage of strong women with traditional motherly love older sisters Weak women Socially isolated from life due to lack of satisfaction Save me What the hell is wrong with her? Senpai Senpai, are you okay? Senpai, if you think you're okay, go ahead. If you didn't have a child, would this have happened? Senpai, what are you talking about? If there were no children... Senpai! What's that? Is it bleeding? Hey, go on. Dr. Han, go on. That's right. That feeling of isolation It could turn into resentment towards your children. Anyway, on the surface... It's true. You can do your job as a mother. You should contact the studio. It means that you can't stand the resentment and anger that grows in your heart It's just that you can't stand the resentment and anger you feel towards society. Have you been tired lately? No, I'm not. I'm sorry about yesterday. I tried my best to explain it to you. But the president still feels uncomfortable. From tomorrow, Seo Seung-ah will be broadcasting the 9:00 news. What? Don't worry, it's only temporary. I'm fine. It was just a mistake. I know it was a mistake. But it's already happened. Hello, everyone, this is YBC News at 9:00. Hello, this is YBC News at 9:00. The city of Seoul is trying to reduce emissions from diesel vehicles. So you've been pushed out by her now? I'm just taking a few days off. It's a critical time. What are you doing with your mind? You've been drinking again? No, I haven't. Mom, please. Didn't you promise me you wouldn't drink? How much are you going to drink? What's wrong with me drinking? Are you angry about my drinking? That's why you're disliked by your son-in-law. You're not trying to get back together again, are you? I just don't think you've been yourself lately. I've been telling you to break up. Why don't you listen to me? Mom, please. Don't get involved in my life again. What about my life? I've given everything for you. What makes you think it's all about you? Get out! Open the door! How can you do this to me? Sera! Hypnosis A, a 20-something in counselling therapy jumped out of a window from the clinic and died. There was no evidence, but the case was closed as a suicide by jumping from a building. Who knows? That person might come to you. Where's your brother now? He... won't let me tell you. There's a light shining on you. Do you see it? Yes, I do. Move slowly towards the light. Are there any side effects from hypnosis? Like the patient's delusions getting worse or something? If you're not a professional hypnotherapist, it can be like that. It's a very difficult and sensitive part. But occasionally patients do falsify their memories. Is there anything else you'd like to ask? It won't take too long. I did some research. I found out that you're very famous for your hypnotherapy. Did Yoon Mi-soo also undergo hypnotherapy? Yes, why? I heard that Yoon Mi-soo got better after your treatment. But the same night she killed her daughter. Do you have anything to say about this treatment? Yoon Mi-soo said she had a headache and was hallucinating. She felt like she was possessed by a ghost. So she underwent hypnotherapy. But it didn't go well because she had a lot of doubts. So she decided to try again soon and went back. But a few days later, she suddenly came to the hospital And she brought this book with her. Then she went straight back. That's all that happened. Why did you bring the book? I was also curious about it That's why I went to their house Open it up and read the last page. When I saw this, I was convinced The hallucination that Misao saw It wasn't schizophrenia. It was a symptom of dissociative identity disorder. What? That person is Yoon Mi-soo's alter ego. And Misao wants to get rid of that person. If the symptoms are worse because of your treatment... What does that mean? After witnessing the crime scene. I couldn't forget Yoon Mi-soo. She was always in front of my eyes. In the same way she was when she died. Maybe I'm possessed by a ghost too. Did you see the dead Yoon Mi-soo's face that day? What? Did you see Yoon Mi-soo's face? Did you see her face? You have to see her face when you're in a situation like this. Otherwise, you'll always think of it. No, why? Then how can you be sure it's Yoon Mi-soo? Then you can use hypnosis. Can you go back to the scene of the crime that day? I'm going to see that face. Relax your body so comfortably. Close your eyes. Just follow the sound of my voice slowly. If you open your eyes now You'll be in the middle of a wide field Where are you now? Standing in the field. What can you see around you? I see a small barn. Go there and have a look. Go into the barn and have a look What do you see? There are stairs. Go down and have a look Where are you now? I'm in the foyer of Misao Yoon's house. Look inside. What can you see now? The bathroom. Where's Yoon Mi-soo? In the room over there. Go into the room. Don't be afraid. You have me with you. If something goes wrong, I'll be ready to help you wake up. Where's Yoon Mi-soo? I... I... I can't do it. We're almost there. Just see the face and it's over. Did you see it? No. - No. - What? No, she's not here. Calm down. Look around. No, I don't want to stay here anymore. I need to get out of here. I need to see her face. That's how it ends. Stop, please stop. Sister! Sister! Sister! Sister! Sister! Sera, where are you now? What do you see? I see bats. And a deer. Is there anyone there? It's okay, Se Ra. Yoon Mi-soo! It's that woman, that woman. Look at that woman's face. You see her face? Really? What's this all about? The senior director is looking for you. I started with the morning news I haven't had a good day's rest in seven years I've given everything here How can you suddenly be so Yes, we know that Anchor Cheng has worked very hard But it's hard for us to make this decision And it's surprising that we have to let a reporter A reporter with no experience in news broadcasting To suddenly take charge of the main news What does that make us anchors? Yes, but these days it's... But these days, it's the era of the reporter standing in front of the camera. Look at other general channels. And to be honest, that's why That's why Anchor Jung got the title of reporter, right? What? Reporter Seo did a good job too The viewers' reaction was good too I'm likely to flip the case of Yoon's mother and daughter straight away What does that mean? Yoon's responsible physician I've been investigating that person recently When I went back to the interview recently I witnessed the man rummaging through the scene I found out that the most dangerous thing about that man was The patient he treated 10 years ago died He was under investigation for a long time. There must be something wrong with that man's hypnotherapy. Are you saying that the doctor was responsible for killing Yoon and her daughter? No. He forced them to death, to be exact. So... What are you trying to do with a closed case? I thought the case was closed as a suicide. That's the police's position. Stop it. Can't you judge the situation? Hey! Jung Se-Ra. Who are you? Sera, it's CHOI In-ho. Can I talk to you now? I'm Se-Ra's mother. Can I speak to Se-Ra? What does the doctor want with my daughter? I'm calling to talk about your daughter's treatment. Treatment? I haven't heard of it. What kind of treatment are you referring to? I'm sorry, I can't talk about it without your daughter's permission. I've just realized why Se-Ra is acting so strange lately. What did she say that irritated a normal child? It's as if she's been caught in some weakness. She's lost her mind. She has a stress disorder after the recent interview. That's all I can say. That level of stress. She'll be fine as soon as she gets some rest. It seems that Se-Ra's weakness may be you. What did you say? It's okay. My daughter won't go there again. Don't call again. What a disgrace! Don't come over. Don't come over. Mom! Where's my mother-in-law? She said she wasn't feeling well today. Why didn't you answer your phone? You didn't even go to the annual party. What am I supposed to do? Do I have to tell everyone that we're going our separate ways? Tell me what you think after you've read it. What are you going to do? You know how I am. I'm so... What's the situation? You... When is your fucking situation going to get better? Is work the only thing in your life? Don't you think about me at all? What about our family? That's why this has to stop. I'm too tired to continue this verbal argument. Why? Is it because of your mother? Let go! To be honest, we're all in this situation because of my mother-in-law. You seem to be mistaken. Even if you appear on TV and pretend to be noble. You're just being a puppet for your mother. And your mother? She just wants to use you to shine. I think it's more like you hate me because I'm more successful than you. What? Why do you always blame my mother? You're making me suffocate even more. Forget it. That's enough. I can't take it anymore. What is this? How did this happen? Who the hell is... Who else could it be? Mom. The number you have dialed cannot be reached at this time. After the beep... Hello, Ms. Jung Se Ra. You called me yesterday, right? Yes, it was your mother. How are you doing? What did you say to my mom? Can you come to the hospital today if it's convenient? Why should I? About the face Se-Ra saw during the hypnosis. I'd like to know more about it. I said I didn't see anything. Calm down. Let's meet first. We have to find out who Se-Ra saw. The man who killed my daughter. You drove Misao to her death. Because of your fucking sickness. Is it fun to play with patients who come to you for treatment? You think I don't know that, don't you? Can I record this call too? How's your mother? She seems very unstable. Ms. Jung Se Ra? Who are you? Ah... my name is Choi In-ho. I'm Jung Se Ra's doctor. Is Ms. Jung Se Ra home now? She says she can always see She says she can always see the dead woman at the crime scene. It's hard for her to continue the news. I just spoke to her on the phone. She doesn't seem to be doing well. Is that so? Was there no problem between Se-Ra and her mother? Problems? Se Ra seems to be giving her mother a hard time. I don't know if you've heard. My mother-in-law likes to drink a lot. Sera has a problem with that too. I want to show you something. It's not Se-Ra who needs treatment now, but her mother. This is... Excuse me... Ms. Seo Seung-ah. Mother-in-law. I just said that, right? Mother-in-law? What... what's going on here? Did you have another fight? Sera! Are you upstairs? What do you want to say to me for having to come to a place like this? I... I... I want to ask you something. Why would I do that? It's not a game. It won't work that way. It's all over now. This position belongs to me. I'm sorry, I have to prepare for the news. I suddenly remembered that when I was preparing the news here I was wearing a white jacket that I really liked. What? I thought the whole world belonged to me. Just like you think now. What's wrong with you? Are you okay? I'm not really interested in how the world works at all. But I've always wanted to be the person the world needs. What are you talking about? Hello? Yeah, where are you? You're not at your mother's house. I had to come to the station for something. Then why didn't you answer the phone? Why did you go to my mother's house? I was with a doctor named Choi In-ho. Didn't you have treatment with him recently? Why didn't you tell me about it? I didn't know anything about it. Did you go to my mother's house with that man? Honey, you shouldn't trust him. He's a stalker who follows me around. Really? It's like he's going to do something to Mom. You can't stay with him either. Just get out and call the police. Damn it, I got it. I'll take care of it. Lee So-jung! What are you doing? I'm sorry. I need to confirm something. I think there's something wrong... Who are you? Are you a doctor? You seem to have misunderstood something. Calm down. What are you talking about? Why do you want to get close to Se-Ra? I saw a bat. A bat... What? I saw a small warehouse. I'll tell you everything. Please let go first. Let's go to the police station, asshole. You're a pervert! There are steps. And a deer. Damn it! Did you see the face? Mom! Hey, where's Seo Seung-ah? I couldn't reach her. So I'm asking Se-Ra-senpai to fill in for her. Is something wrong? We need to get in touch with her to find out if she's okay. I'm counting on you, too, anchor Jung. I'll say the ending line today. What? Last time, I quit without saying hello. Can't I even say a word? Go ahead, say it. Just say it. We don't have time. Let's get ready. Yes, sir. Let's get ready. Get ready. Three, two, one, go! Hello, everyone. YBC 9:00 news. Hey, let's get the forensics class together. Doctor! What the hell is going on here? Anchor Jung Se Ra. Looks like a dissociative identity disorder too. What? Ten years ago I didn't even have a precise reason I didn't even have time to find the exact reason before I let my patient go. But the last time Misao Yoon came to see me. I still hadn't noticed anything. What are you doing here at this hour, Ms. Yoon Mi-soo? I have to tell you something. I... I... I've been treated by the doctor and I'm doing much better. I don't plan to come back. Thank you so much for your time, doctor. Officer Kim. Yes. She's on the news right now. What? Developing a system is a much-needed part of this. In the early hours of this morning in Dadae-dong, Seoul. A mother and daughter who couldn't bear the hardship of life left a suicide note. She made a desperate choice. It's only been a few days. It's been less than a month since the death of the mother and daughter in Jicheon-dong. After watching Reporter Seo and then looking at Senior Se Ra. I realize the power of a veteran. Isn't it? Please wear a warm jacket when you go out tomorrow. It's going to be generally warm across the country. But cold air will hit some areas. Temperatures will be slightly cooler in the morning Morning temperatures tomorrow will be more than 10 degrees cooler than today A cold wave warning will be issued across the mainland. Here's a look at the temperatures in each region... The temperature change is too sudden What's going on? Sorry, sorry. Seniors! What is it? What's wrong with you? Wake up! What? Isn't that your closing line for today? And that's today's weather forecast. Come on. Ten seconds to the end. The anchor is ready. Three, two, one, go. Okay, once again, a mother and daughter tragedy is on the air today. It reminded me of a similar case that happened 30 years ago. On May 10, 1989, in Jungang-go, Seoul. A single mother in her thirties committed suicide with her six-year-old daughter. And her six-year-old daughter committed suicide together. The daughter woke up crying out of fear. That's when the neighbourhood called the police. Fortunately, the mother was quick enough to save her life.

Sera. Dr. Choi! You need to talk to my mom. My mom is going to treat me... Your mother has passed away. You know that, too The person I'm talking to on the phone It's not your mother. It was you. That's all right. My daughter won't go there again. Don't call again. What a disgrace! Sera. Mom thinks this is your chance. A chance to be a real anchor. A real... The anchor. What really happened that day? I went to my mother's house I was afraid she had hidden another drink So I looked everywhere It was the first time I'd seen any of my mother's old photos. What can you see now? Seriously, what's wrong with you? Didn't you promise me you'd stop drinking? How many times have I tried to talk you out of it? Why aren't you sober? Why are you going through people's rooms without permission? You can really be the best. You've always done a good job. But... Do you have to have a baby? It's my baby. It's up to me to decide if I want to have it or not. Let's go. We're going to the hospital. Mom! Don't wait until later to regret it. Listen to Mom now. Are you crazy? Daughter? Are you okay? I'm going to get the medicine. I see. You can't have a scar on the anchor's face. That's why you're going to kill me, too. Because I'll interfere with your future. What did you say?
