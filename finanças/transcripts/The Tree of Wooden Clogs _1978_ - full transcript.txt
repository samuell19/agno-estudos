So the Virgin, our heavenly mother mother of us all, performed a miracle The Madonna and Child painted on this wall began to cry A messenger was sent to tell General Lutrec. Lutrec suspected a trick so he came to look. But when he saw the Madonna cnying he fell to his knees and placed his helmet and sword at her feet in devotion. Over 350 years have passed but that helmet and sword are still there to remind us of all the dangers waiting in the world to remember that great miracle and all the other miracles that happen evenywhere eveny day in the lives of men and of all creation. Dear friends we wouldn’t be here without miracles. Miracles are the power man doesn’t have, as much as the air we breathe the land that feeds us, and the water and light that give us life.

Ohh/ when know/edge and progress can we finally speak of reaching new heights in civilization. become evenyday institutions when one man no longer enjoys privileges only then can we say we’ve built a democratic society Unfortunately, social progress moves slowly hindered by those who fear it and by the lack of courage and sacrifice of those who nevertheless invoke it as a human right. So most people remain passively in the background waiting for events to develop in their favor while a small band of rebels and innovators bravely forges a path all great progress has come they seem to be dreaming in the present. But they’re not idle dreamers! They do everything they can to change all that is mired in the past and outdated in the human spirit Fortunately, this minority rich in intellect and nobility of spirit never ceases to advance and gather new converts. And those ideas at first considered dangerous or utopian or even simply bizarre are gradually taken up and championed by all. This is how society takes on new life. and even politics are transformed. My friends the old social order is becoming outdated as a new one takes shape on the horizon... Down, boy! Down! Go lie down, you mutt! That’s a good girl Give me your hoof Did you have breakfast?

So the seeds won’t die Bun and get the peg on the wheelbarrow. He’s going to work When you plant the seedlings you always leave some of the soil around their roots There That’s one Why plant them all by the wall? Because the wall holds the heat from the stable inside and from the sun outside and tomatoes need heat. If we don’t get a frost this year we’ll sell our tomatoes in town two weeks before evenyone else What will the others say? They’ll stand there gaping with their mouths wide open O/ga run inside and close the kitchen window while I bring in the wash Get them in the stable A storm’s coming Mama, it’s raining!

He tried to pny it open with his pick, but the wood creaked and moaned as if unwilling to open. So he stood on it and gave it one great blow - crack! and split it apart The dead woman lay there in her veil with her arms crossed First he took the tiara from her head Then, to take her pearl necklace he slipped his hand under her neck and lifted her head. The rings on one hand came off easily, but try as he might he couldn’t pull the larger and more valuable rings off her other hand. So he took out his knife and chopped off the hand with all the rings. No one ever found out he’d done this. But one night the man went to a great party in a villa his horse suddenly reared up and wouldn’t go on. Over by the chapel of the Madonna he saw a woman in black Do you need anything, ma’am? She asked if he could take her home and started whipping the horse. But instead of heading for the village, the horse turned down the road to the cemeteny and stopped right outside the gates He kept whipping the horse but it wouldn’t move. l’m home,” said the lady Please help me down The man was beside himself with fright but what could he do? He got down, went around to help the lady down and said... Give me your hand, ma’am The lady stood up and said to him... My hand? You already have it!

They have nothing to hide There’s another reason. They’re setting off immediately on a long and dangerous journey where they’ll visit their aunt Sister Maria, Mother Superior at Santa Caterina’s. As for the two of you stay alert and keep your wits about you because people today have strange ideas. Pray to God and to the Virgin to protect you always. And above all, try always to love one another The love between two people is something money can’t buy God says not to seek worldly riches but the blessings of paradise And remember that paradise begins with the love that we show each other here on earth. Are the ladies comfortable? Then we’ll be going Good-bye, ladies. Best wishes to the bride Where are they going? - Milan. By boat. They’ll be there in an hour or so. Newh/weds! Best wishes!
