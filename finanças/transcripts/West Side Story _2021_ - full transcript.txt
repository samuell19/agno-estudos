Jets! Woman: Hey, hey! Come on. Ha! Jets: Yeah! Come on, come on! Beat it. Jets member: Oh, yeah! Boy: Hey! Hey, you! Come on! Jets! Jets member: Come on, baby John! Officer: Alright now, all you separate! Separate! Separate! You're driving me to my grave, ya pack of jackals. Watch yourself, sergeant krupke, you're gonna inflame your asthma, shouting like that. Why don't you leave the Puerto Ricans alone, riff? Christ almighty. And you lot, you're in New York now. You got a problem, you call the cops. Youse can't play at being cops yourselves. Pero we call the cops, you show up and arrest us! You're never around when these hijueputas mess up our stores and our streets. See, I get confused when you say "our streets," seeing how these streets are ours by right - of being born here, amigo. - The jets! How many times do I gotta tell you, Bernardo? I don't speak spic. Krupke: Hey, hey! That's enough! That's enough! Come on! Break it up! Jesus wept, baby John. Who did that to your ear? Which one of them nailed you? Who cracked your head open, hombre? In English. Same guy who nailed your ear, maybe? Maybe. I don't remember. I realise if any of you helps me out, you might spoil your chance to murder each other over control of this earthly paradise. The jets control it and you know it. Uh-huh, yeah, but, golly gee, Balkan, not according to the New York City committee for slum clearance, which has decided to pull this whole hellmouth down to the bedrock, and you're in the way. Aah! Nice reflexes, muchacho. So, any day now, all of you are gonna be evicted. You'll have to "vamoose," as we say in Spanish. We're not relocating. We have rights. Rights, huh? Where are they? You back down, Bernardo. Don't be stupid. Some night, muchacho, maybe you'll get to see me fight. 'Course, you'll have to leave your gun at home, lieutenant. Evict yourself off my crime scene, Bernardo. Vamos. Jets member: Chick, chick, chick. Jets member: Chickie, chickie, chickie. A boxer and a singer. Jets member 3: Get a load of this guy. You want me to book the whole bunch of you? Keep up the serenade and see what... [Viva Puerto Rico iibre! I am ordering you clowns to disperse! Now! We're outnumbered, boys. Thousands more are on their way, and once they're here, they pop out kids like crazy. Am I right? Tell me which one of them nailed baby John's ear and I'll put him out of circulation. Work with me, fellas. Or they're gonna drive you off your turf. You said it was the slum clearance committee that was driving us off, now it's the prs. You gotta get your story straight, lieutenant schrank. We're very impressionable. Most of the white guys who grew up in this slum climbed their way out of it. Irish, Italian, Jews. Nowadays, their descendants live in nice houses and drive nice cars and date nice girls you'd want to marry. Your dads or your granddads stayed put, drinking and knocking up some local piece who gave birth to you. The last of the can't-make-it caucasians. What's a gang without its terrain, its turf? You're a month or two away from finding out, one step ahead of the wrecking ball. And in this uncertain world, the only thing you can count on is me. I'm here to keep the civil peace until the last building falls. And if you boys make trouble on my turf, riff, hand to heart, you're headed to an upstate prison cell for a very long time. By the time you get out, this will be a shiny new neighbourhood of rich people in beautiful apartments with puerto rican doormen to chase trash like you away. Wait! I got a question for you, lieutenant. How tall did you used to be before you, you know, "schrank"? Come on, sergeant, ride with me. Long as I know you, riff, you ain't had the sense, god gave a pigeon. Riff: Come here, let's see what he done. Come on. Well, that's gonna scar, buddy boy. - You think so? - Frankenstein time. They can't make us up and leave. We're here, ain't we? American citizens, which them spics ain't! Them they can chase off, not us. Puerto Ricans are Americans, - you ignoramus. - Ah, go eat a green banana! Puerto Rico's like a state, ain't it? So, deez is right... Baby John: No, it's something else. Jets member: There are only 48 states, - ya dead battery. - What do you know? Whatever they are, citizens or who gives a fart, what we know is... Jets member 2: They ain't us. So, spill it, krazy Kat, what are you thinking? I'm thinking it's past time for a rumble. For a all-in, all-out, once-and-for-all, winner-takes-all, high-noon-shootout- at-the-o.k. Corral rumble! Balkan: Wild blue yonder! About time! We do 'em like we done the Egyptian kings. - And the emeralds. - And the bishops. Alright, so Tony and me will sit down with... - Jets member: Tony? - Yeah, Tony. Jets member 2: What's this got to do with him? He ain't stood with us once since he got out. He's on parole. He's gotta be careful, is all. He cannot be running around... Tony's done with the jets, riff. He ain't done with the jets. Like that's even a thing! You cannot be done with this family. Maybe it wasn't a thing before, but now, riff? The lieutenant's right. What are the jets if we got no territory? - Jets member: That's right! - All: Yeah. Schrank doesn't know his ass from his elbow. Look, Tony and me started the jets cause none of us would even be here if it wasn't for all of us. And all you know it. When you're a jet you're a jet all the way from your first cigarette to your last dyin' day when you're a jet if the spit hits the fan you got brothers around you're a family man you're never alone you're never disconnected you're home with your own when company's expected you're well-protected then you are set with a capital j which you'll never forget till they cart you away when you're a jet You stay a jet - So, meet Tony and me at the dog days dance at the gym tonight. We can't rumble at the gym, it'll be lousy with cops! And maybe we've had enough trouble with the Puerto Ricans for one day? Relax. It's a social mixer. So we'll mix until the time's right to fix the rumble for tomorrow night. Be there 10:00 pm, punctual-like, dressed to kill, walking tall! We always walk tall! We're jets! The greatest. When you're a jet you're the top cat in town you're the gold-medal kid with the heavyweight crown when you're a jet you're the swingin'est thing little boy, you're a man jets: Little man you're a king riff: The jets are in gear our cylinders are clickin' the sharks'll steer clear jets: Cause every puerto rican's a lousy chicken here come the jets like a bat out of hell someone gets in our way someone don't feel so well here come the jets little world, step aside better go underground better run, better hide we 're drawin' the line so keep your noses hidden we 're hangin' a sign says "visitors forbidden" and we ain't kiddin' jets: Here come the jets, yeah and we're gonna beat every last buggin' gang on the whole buggin' street on the whole ever mother-lo vin' street yeah! - Can. - Riff: Come on. Just for an hour, only a little hour. You used to like dancing. - No monkeyshines. - Come on, riff, can. Christ almighty. You know, there's dust on everything. You know, ever since... Hey, I swear on what's holy, it is just girls sipping punch and music... - And the sharks. - And the spics. - And a rumble. - Which all you gotta do... You're on your own, pal-o-mine. Is help me haggle over the terms of the rumble. You don't need me helping ya screw up your life. You know how I get. I will start runnin' my mouth. You... you got command. You are West Side legendary! And, Tony, Tony, the jets. I gave 'em my word you'd show. - Why would you do that? - Because... Because it's a rumble! We need you if we're going to war. You can't refuse us now. And because I know you. Or I thought I did, before you got all unlike yourself, before you went upstate. Woman: Tony? I'm coming! It's like you're still in prison, and the old witch is the warden. She gave me a job and a place to stay. She's always been there for me, like nobody else. - Oh, nobody, huh? Thanks, pal. - So don't call her... Thanks a big fat lot. Yeah. You know I didn't mean you wasn't there. You was always there. - Womb to tomb. - Sperm to worm. So, come with me to the dance, huh? Come on. Is it graziella? That what's eatin' you? No, it ain't grazie. She said that you and she was done. It's good that you're keeping her company. Even before you got locked up, you know? It's cool. Don't get all the way you get. Grazie's a great girl, and the jets are the greatest. And you, you're like, you know, blood to me. But I'm scared of myself, riff. What I done to that kid. What I almost done. You gotta get over that. What is the point in beating yourself up? I wanna be unlike how I was. Cause I was disappearing down a sewer and taking you and everything with me. - Woman: Tony, you coming? - Yeah, he heard ya! I had time. Lots of it. Locked up like that, and for the first time ever, I took a look inside, and that was rough, doing that, but I... I gotta stay with myself. You know what I mean? Maybe stay... By myself, just for... Yeah, you know what? You're just too deep for me, kid. You know, I don't know who I am. And who cares who I am? Nobody, including me. I know that this dust that's covering everything right now, that's the four-story buildings that was standing here when you went upstate a year ago. You know, I wake up to everything I know either getting sold or wrecked, or being taken over by people that I don't like. And they don't like me. And you know what's left out of all that? The jets. My guys. My guys, who are just like me. Who are just like you. I can't go to the dance, riff! My parole officer said no going out! I told you I don't want you in my store. I'm a paying customer. You've been stealing from me since you were six. Now, get out. I mean it. And leave Tony alone. He is not allowed to associate with criminals. Look, don't fall off that ladder. At your age, brittle bones. That's all I'm saying. Woman: You'll pay for that candy. Five cents. On the counter! Stand me for a milky way, huh? Least you could do. Womb to tomb wasn't never a joke for me. Don't be like that. Just cause I can't go to a dance? Tony, I don't tell you who to hang out with. But... "But those boys are juvenile delinquent. "They're no good for you. And you better watch out." Hey. "You make fun of the way I talk "one more time, blondie..." I'm gonna talk to riff and tell him that he can't just come in here and not pay. Tony, wake up. I know you love riff, but he hates Puerto Ricans. That is not you. Riff don't hate you. I married a gringo. He thinks that makes me a gringa, which it don't. And I ain't. Well, it's guys like riff and me, when things ain't familiar, we just got this instinct to, you know... You... Even as an angry little boy, somehow there was this... This promise that you couldn't keep hidden. Not from you. And sometimes, I see you smiling, like you're waiting for the, what do you call, Irish sweepstakes, instead of sweeping the floor like I pay you to do. I sweep as good as you pay. - Yeah? - Look it. Ooh. You see? Promise. You bring dead floors back to life. Keep looking for better, mi milagro. Like you always done. Could be? Who knows? There's something due any day I will know right away soon as it shows - it may come cannonballing -Aah! Down through the sky gleam in its eye bright as a Rose - Who knows? It's only just out of reach down the block, on a beach under a tree I got a feeling there's a miracle due gonna come true coming to me could it be? Yes, it could something's coming something good if I can wait something's coming I don't know what it is but it is gonna be great with a click, with a shock phone'll jingle, door'll knock open the latch something's coming don't know when but it's soon catch the moon one-handed catch around the corner or whistling down the river come on, deliver to me will it be? Yes, it will maybe just by holding still it'll be there come on, something come on in don't be shy meet a guy pull up a chair the air is humming and something great is coming who knows? It's only just out of reach down the block, on a beach maybe tonight maybe tonight maybe tonight Woman: Maria! Maria! They're gonna be here in five minutes. Woman: Mamita. Didn't you hear me...? What are you doing? Ay, nena... Maria: No, no, no, no. It look like a shroud, it's so big and so white. It wouldn't look like a shroud if it was red. Speak English. In gimbels, there are lots of dresses that fit me. And you don't shop in gimbels. You clean in gimbels. - Maria: Ay. - Mm. Ahorrar tus chavitos, fancy pants. Aw. Si. Ay, turn around. Hmm. Ay, Anita. Oh! Ay, don't mess up my hair. I just got it to act right. Ugh. Ok. Get your shoes on. Bernardo will be so mad if we make him late. And I want to dance. Bernardo's always mad. Necesito lipstick. I'm too short. I need, please. Please, some lipstick, and maybe some eyeliner. - Hmm. - The boys think I'm a kid. You are a kid, kiddo. I'm 18. I have a job. I've been taking care of papi since I was six. Bernardo thinks I'm a baby. Who cares what Bernardo thinks? Chino is the only boy who counts. Oh, chino. Mi primer baile en nueva York and I have to go with the zangano I don't want to. Ay, be nice. Chino is a very sweet boy. You can't take that personally. He's got to be like that. It's how he got to be a great boxer. Everyone's afraid of him. Mm, but I'm not. Man: Anita, we're home. Are you ready? Chino's here. You gotta dance with her. - I don't know how to dance. - Ay. She's bossy. She gonna show you how. Don't move. You always look out for me. You're the best friend I ever had. I owe you so much. But I just wish that... You're the smartest friend I ever had. Maria needs to meet smart guys like you. Let me join the sharks. Ay, muchacho, not this again. Por favor, let me help you protect our people. Bernardo: No. You keep out of that. It's stupid. We gotta do it, but it's stupid. Maria can't like a iambeojo who just works day and night. Never stands up like her brother does. She says all the time she doesn't want anyone like me. Just be chino. But be a chino who dances. You look like mami. And, chino, qué guapo. He took off from night school just so he could take you to the dance. Gracias, chino. Night school, accounting, and... And, chino, what else are you learning about? Adding machine repair. Anita: And just think, how many adding machines in New York City. Chino is gonna be rich. Well, not exactly, pero... Boxers get rich. Boxers get their brains knocked out. Bossy, como te dije, y una wiseass. The gringos tonight, they stare because... Anita: Oh, like you don't stare. Because our girls make their girls look lousy. The first gringo boy who smiles at you... pow! Ay, Mr. Juvenile delincuente. Bernardo: Vamos. I told you she likes him. Anita: You want her to pick him, keep telling her she has to like him. Hey, get away from her, you lesbo! - Get out of here! - Hey, hey, what are you doing? How about you give me some room? You wanna dance, buddy? Get back! Officer: Let's back up! Back up! Everyone, keep calm now! Contain the aggression, ok? What's the matter with you guys?

You don't have a fight till next week. The match with that Thompson guy. What was his name? Your brother has something to say to you. I apologise for behaving last night like a... Like a gangster. It was embarrassing. And he's apologising. Perdon. I'm a grown-up now, Bernardo. I can dance with anyone I like. As long as he's puertorriquefio. But why? Tony's a nice boy. Tony? Tony. Who cares if he's a...? I don't know what he is. A yankee? He's a polack. That's what he is. A big, dumb polack. "Polack," says the spic. Now you sound like a real American. I don't want you to marry a gringo. Marry him? I danced with him, Bernardo. For a minute, until you... You're crazy. I can't talk to you anymore. I was ok on my own. Just me and papi for five years without you, while you came here, where you do everything you want. You... you study, and you make money... And he boxes. Si. And you have your boxing. And he fights in the streets. Don't fight with the jets. I want you to be happy. Anita: Mm. Here, dead man, eat your eggs. And everyone, speak English. But I'm here, too. And I... I want to make a life, a home. Maybe go to city college like rosalia's cousin, Virginia. I want to be happy here. Enghsh. Puerto Rico, si. That is what you think. - I'm gonna think for myself. - You keep away from him. As long as you're in my house... This ain't your house. She pays rent here same as me and you. This is about family. Ah! Maria... Maybe chino and your friends fall down at your feet, and maybe you scare the americanos when you make fists and angry faces... And I am not interested in what you have to say. You want to know where my home is? It's where I pay rent. Right here, where I work my fingers raw, mending pants and hemming neckties so that I can earn enough money to pay other girls to sew for me, so that someday I can rent a shop of my own in this great, big, beautiful nueva York. And if you think that I'm going back home to Puerto Rico with six kids that I put to bed hungry every night, amor de mi vida, you are dreaming.

You are never done with troubles. Nunca. - Nunca. "Nunca" means "never"? - Uh-huh. What's "forever"? Like, "I wanna be with you forever." You don't wanna start, maybe, with "I'd like to take you out to coffee"? No. Come on, tell me. "I wanna take you to chock full o' nuts "for a cream cheese sandwich on a raisin bread"? This ain't casual like that. "I want to be with you forever." "With you." "Para siempre." "Siempre." "Siempre." "Forever." Tony: I wanna show you something. It's a surprise, uptown. - You seem sorta... - There's a fight tonight. Between my brother and his friends. - News to me. - And your friend who helped you when Bernardo... Riff. Tell him, riff, tell him not to. It's because of us they're gonna fight, verdad? Well, get your brother to call it off. Bernardo's too angry. Well, riff's angry, too, so... Come on. This place we're going, it's, uh, up past Harlem. It's practically at the tip of the island. My brother... There's so much more against him than riff. He's angry because... The whole world has been against riff since he was born. Do you think it's easier for us? Uh, well, I think you come from families, homes. You and Bernardo, you have hope. You think riff has that? Riff could have hope if he didn't try to take hope from people he doesn't know. Riff didn't start this, it was Bernardo. He came after me. Just cause I wanted to dance with you. Tony, if someone gets hurt because of what we do... What did we do to anyone? We don't do anything wrong, liking each other, - pero... - Maria. I don't just like you. We can't pretend what we do doesn't cause trouble. I can't talk my guys outta making trouble. Trouble's what they're made of. All of you go suck a pickle. You think we're going to jail? They're fishing, is all. Asking questions. Which we ain't answering. So, you're gonna tell me where and when the rumble's happening... Or I'm gonna send you straight to the tombs.

Gee, officer krupke krup you This is for you. Tony: This is the surprise. Maria: It look like a church. Tony: It's a museum now, you know. First time I saw this place, I was on a prison bus. Up to the state prison in ossining. There was a rumble. And I busted up this kid. He was in the Egyptian kings. He only didn't die because of luck, like, one more punch and he probably would've died. And I would've done it. I would've murdered this messed-up kid who wasn't no different from me. And for a year in prison and since I got out, I can't quit thinking about what I almost done. I think about killing him, and... And it's like I'm always just about to fall off the edge of the world's tallest building. I stopped failing the second I saw you. I shouldn't have asked you to stop the fighting. I don't want you to go anywhere near the fighting. Don't laugh. It means I wanna be... I know what it means. I don't know what that... - Oh, that's... - Don't laugh. I, Tony... I, Anton, take you, Maria, - rich or poor... - I'm poor. I'm poorer. To love you and respect you. Siempre. Tony: Make of our hands one hand make of our hearts one heart make of our vows one last vow even death won't part us now make of our lives one life day after day one life now it begins now we start one hand one heart only death will part us now You're worried. But they're still my guys. - They'll listen to me. - But what if you can't? We can't be together while they're brawling all around us. Because of us. I swear to you, Maria, there won't be any fight. Make of our lives one life day after day one life now it begins now we start one hand one heart -Maria: Death won't part -even death won't part Maria: Us now -us now Come see me tonight. Man: You ever fired a gun before? Sure, of course I have. What kind? Colt. Revolver. That so? What'd it shoot? Bullets. - .32s. - Colt shoots .22s. We got money. I don't sell heaters to unscrubbed boys. These guys, the ones we're rumbling with, they're bringing heat. Cause they think we're bringing heat. So, we need to bring heat so they know that we ain't defenceless. And vice versa. Mutually assured destruction. I don't know what that is. That's a Smith and Wesson, model 10. Classic of its kind. If you want it, take it, why don't ya? Fires Trey eights. Makes quite a hole for a little gun. It's loaded. You don't gotta cock it, even. You just squeeze the trigger and... You might as well.

Hey, why should we call it off? We got a gun. Shut up, tiger. Stay out of this. You know we wouldn't even need a gun if you was with us? But you ain't, so let go of my goddamn gun. I paid for it. Tony: You paid for it? Riff: Right. Tony: Oh, ok, well, in that case, - oopsy-Daisy. - Riff: Tony. Tony. Tony! Tony! Tony! Give me the gun! - Call off the rumble. - Come on, it's mine. It's yours?

If you don't keep your word, jefe, how am I going to believe you'll keep out of our territory after... And just when all hope is lost... So, is this the shot heard round the world, or just, you know, more of your bullshit? Don't ask me about shooting, pal. You're the one with the gun. That's right, and who are you? Friend or foe? - You're out of control. - Hey. I don't need it if you stand with us. Here, take it. Go on, it'll be safe with you. And you pitch in. I wanna talk to... I'm doing the talking now. - Let's do it! - All: Yeah! Right now! - Can I talk to you? - Anything you need to say, - you can say through me. - We talked enough. Let's try something else. You and me, we just got off on the wrong foot, is all. I always know which foot I'm on. We all know you can fight, Bernardo. So, can you just quit dancing for a second... Riff: Yeah, can you quit whispering in his ear? And listen to what I came here to tell you? I got nothing against you. And... and if I, somehow or other, if I offended you, I apologise. Oye, pana, I thought we were going to fight. Did you bring him flowers, too? Come on, quit flirting with him! Close his eyes! Hey, can't you shut up for a single goddamn second? What are you afraid of? Your parole officer? You are breaking my heart with this shit! - Come on! - Bernardo: A convict? How long in prison? Uh, a year. In prison, there were Puerto Ricans, Dominicans? Tony: Sure. Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Cubans. They love locking up us brown guys. Tony: This is not about skin. It's... it's about... It's about territory! A-rab: That's right! Our territory! None of us would be here if any of us believed we had any place else to be. What did you do to get yourself locked up, primo? He beat the snot outta someone exactly like you! It don't matter what I did. I'm different now. And... You don't gotta worry about me being with Maria. So, you told god and Jesus when you get out, you gonna become somebody new? Am I right, pendejito? And then you came to that dance and you see my sister, and you think... "How about I get myself a brown girl?" "I never spent time with a little puertorriquefia before." Riff: Tony! "If I can be with a coloured girl like her, "I'll be somebody better than I was. "Somebody I never been before." Diesel: Put your hands up! Baby John: Come on! Hit him! A-rab: Come on! He won't fight you, fight someone who will. I love her, Bernardo. Stay out of this! Finish it!

You cashed the check? I tore mine up. - Uh-huh. - You tore up a $500 check? Once you cash the check, mi'jita, they can evict you! I mailed mine right back to the public works.

Quique: It got so bad so fast. Quique: He was a hero. I know people say that about a lot of people... Bernardo was a fool. What did he die for? Murio iuchando por su dignidad... And for pride, mi hermano, orgullo puertorriquefio! Bernardo, he died to show those gringos how tough Puerto Ricans are. And if they push us too far... If those nobodies can take your pride away from you, tu eres mas estupido que Bernardo. It's a big world. Bernardo let the gringos tell him there's only this barrio, these 20 bad blocks. Don't you do what Bernardo did. You kill a gringo, they kill you. Sooner or later, the gringos kill everything. Chino, chino, chino, por favor. Don't follow me. Bernardo was your husband? Anita: Yes. Oh. Close enough. Your brother was angry you danced with a white boy at the mixer last night. No. I don't think so. You don't think the boy you danced with was white? Or you don't think Bernardo was angry? I wouldn't dance with a white boy. Yeah? I heard you came with a date. Some, uh, puerto rican boy. Goes by the street name "chino." Word is, chino's got a gun. That's what the word is, anyway. He's armed... And hunting for this white stranger who she danced with, who we think killed your boyfriend! Anything else you wanna add? Bernardo told me about you. I'm flattered. The way you talked to him. Chino is gentle. He doesn't have a gun. Apparently, now he does. I have a, uh... A headache? She has her monthly, you know? I get the picture. I need for this, uh, medicine. Anita, she can... she can go for me? Mamita... In English. Si. Si. English is hard to, uh... Yeah, I bet it is. She wants you to go to doc's drugstore and ask Valentina for... Hot tea is how my wife handles it. What did I say? Tell Valentina, I hope her cousin arrived safe from santurce. And I'm sorry I can't be there to meet him like I promised. And all of a sudden, fluency. That means "I'll come as soon as I can." I can go? You're not his widow or anything. I'm done with you. Must be tough, losing a brother. So, let's start from the beginning. Graziella: I wanna go see him. Talk to him. Tonyjust wants to be alone right now, he don't wanna see us. A-rab: He ain't alone. The old lady's down there with him. Does he know we're up here? Me and grazie? Does he know I'm here? Tony cared about me once. He don't wanna see you, grazie. Go home. We left him lying there. In the salt shed. Ice... I know. That's bothering me. Bothers me, too, deez. Anybodys: He ain't there anymore. Action: Jesus Christ. Ice: Where'd you come from? Down the chimney like santy claus. What's Tony gonna do? Go pop yourself, ya blister. How long's he figure on holing up down there? Till the heat dies down. When's that gonna happen? Two guys died, so... Never ever. Bernardo's friend, chino? He has riff's gun. Oh, Jesus. And he's hunting for Tony. What are we gonna do? I don't know. Where you going? To keep track of chino. Yeah, yeah. Good. You do that. In and out of shadows. That's how. Hey. You done good, buddy boy. Leave. I want to see your friend, Tony. He's here? He's supposed to be. I have a message for him. Where is Valentina? You're Bernardo's girl. We saw you at the gym. Yeah, you wanna dance, chiquita banana? Dancing up a storm, you was, dipping them hips. Valentina! Spanish? You come here speaking Spanish? I wasn't talking to you. No Spanish. Not with us. Not today. Let me pass. You heard her, boys. She wants to pass. Hmm, she's too dark to pass. Let her go. No one wants you here. Why don't you dance for us first? Dance with me, darling, like you danced at the gym. Numbers, stop it. Stop it. Cutting in. Balkan, out of here. A-rab: Come on, you pig, let's see you move! Anita: No, no, no. Bernardo's black pig. Woman: Hey! Stop touching her! Graziella: Boys, don't do this! Anita: No! Graziella: Tiger, let her go! Graziella: Let her go! Ice, enough! Enough! Anita: Help me! Graziella: No! Don't hurt her! Open the door! Mouthpiece: Keep moving! Graziella: Don't hurt her! Don't hurt her, please! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! What the hell are you doing? You disgusting pieces of shit! - Mija, mr'ja. - No! Traitor! Go back where you came from. You think I want to stay here? In this city full of ugly, little animals like you? No, gracias. Tell Tony... You tell that murderer... Maria ain't coming. Chino, he found out about them... Tony and Maria. He shot her. Maria is dead. You tell him that. I know you. I know all of your names. Since you was born. I watched you grow up. And you have grown into rapists. You dishonour yourselves. You dishonour your dead. What do we do now? We're done. What was that? What was that? You can never hear nothing from down here. - Was it the cops? - No, no, no. It was not police. No, it was... it was... Uh... now it's alright. Tony, let's sit down for a second, huh? Listen. I got something to ask you. No, no, wait. I... I... I got something... It ain't easy to ask this, so let me just go, ok? Wait, wait. I have something to... You've given me so much already, but when she gets here, just... If you could help us out with the bus fare... -Tony... I have no idea what it's gonna cost to get far enough away, out west some place. 100 bucks for both of us. And we'll get work when we get there. We'll pay you back every cent. I know you ain't got money, so if it's too much to ask... No, no, no. It's not too much. It's not too much. We're gonna name all our girls Valentina. - Hmm. - Cause if you hadn't cared for me like you always done, I wouldn't even be here alive, which... Maybe I shouldn't be. Don't ever say that, Tony. Life matters even more than love. Mm. They're the same thing. Before Maria, maybe I would've said they ain't. But now, it's all life is. Even if it lasts no time at all. A month, a day even. That was Anita upstairs. What's wrong? Chino... What? Chino has a gun. Chino shot Maria. He killed her. She's... she's dead. Tony: Chino! Chino! Where are you? Chino! I'm right here! Chino! Chino! Come on, man! I'm right here! I'm looking for you! Come on! Come on, with me! I know how to hide you. I got places to go they'll never look, just please! Don't leave me here! Get off of me! Chino, kill me! Kill me, too, chino! Chino! Mi amor mio, mi corazon. Maria. Maria. Onlyyou you're the only thing I'll see Forever in my eyes, in my words and in everything I do Nothing else but you ever Give it to me. How do you fire it? Just pull this? How many bullets are left? Enough for you? And you? All of you! I can kill now because I hate now. I hate now. How many can I kill, chino? And still have one bullet left for me! Te adoro, Anton. No, don't touch him!
