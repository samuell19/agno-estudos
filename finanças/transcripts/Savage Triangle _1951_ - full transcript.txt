THE WILD BOY You got rid of him without telling me. When you have a child, you take care of it. The money was owing. We weren't going to feed him indefinitely. You know I would have paid. We thought that you'd abandoned him. Unbelievable! Who's this shepherd that he's with? Gilles. He's up there... It's been 15 years. We never see him. It seems he used to be a sailor. I can't go any further. Whoa...! Well, you have to get off. You just have to follow the path, straight ahead. There's no mistaking it... there's only one house. Thanks anyway. Hey, what about the matter of my money? You owe me for three and a half months. What have you done for me? I don't work for free! You get rid of of my son, and you want to be paid? You're kidding! You're nothing but a... What a nerve! He's got pots of money and he cheats you. Hey, whore! Filthy whore! Come over here and say that! Come on! Get down here, if you're a man! I'll put the bailiff onto you! Good. He won?t complain. Are you Mr. Gilles? - Are you Simon's mother? - Yes. How is he? - Very well. So, someone like you... ...is his mother? Yes. Why? No reason. It's been quite a while since you saw him. You can't always do what you want. Are you kept so busy in Marseilles? It depends. Yes. I'll go and get him for you. It's not far. I'll have to get him ready... This is quite an event. I think he'll recognise you. You can wait inside. - I'll return him to you soon. - Thank you. Did you get it? No, I missed twice. A 20-pound male. You'll have more luck tomorrow. Come on... you have to come home.. Sooner or later you'll have to get some news from your mother. She's sure to come one day. - Do you remember her well? - Oh yes. What's she look like? She's beautiful. She looks like the Virgin that's on the fireplace. Wait... It's her handkerchief. It smells good. It just smells like your pocket. Oh no. Did you see your mother often? - Oh yes. 9 times. I made a notch each time. When was the last time you saw her? When I got the handkerchief. How old were you? Don't know. But Mum stayed a long time... ...Almost all day. Would you be happy to see her again? She's just arrived. She's waiting for you. Come on... What's the matter? What's wrong with you? Doesn't it make you happy? Is she on her own? Come along... Don't be frightened. Well, give me a kiss! My darling! You don't know how to kiss? It's done like this. He has to learn everything. What a little savage. You don?t bite, do you? My darling, how dirty you are! I'm happy to see you, you know. The last time, you barely came to my waist. - Cat got your tongue? - He has to get used to you. - He has a gun? - He has to. That's not all. It's late, you can't go back. You can sleep here. You'll eat with us and leave tomorrow. During the day. If I'm no bother. Not at all... For the one time you've come. Quick... go and bring the flock in. How funny! The sheep sleep here too? Well, what must they be thinking? This is for you. Well, open the box. - What are they for? - They're toys. - "Toys"? - Yes, toys. - What do you do with them? - Play with them. You'd think you'd never seen a cow before. And this is a horse. - Aren't you happy? - Yes. He seems to be sulking. You know, here... I brought you some shoes. I hope they'll fit you. I said for an 11-year old. He's nearly 12. That's what I said. You try, and if they don't fit, I'll send you another pair. Do you still like me? Oh, that's better already! -"Now, after they withdrew, "behold the angel of the Lord "who appeared in a dream to Joseph "and said to him: "'Rise up, "'and take the little child and his mother "'and flee to Egypt "''and stay there until I tell you, "'for Herod will seek "'the little child and put him to death.""' This is amazing. He reads like a man and understands all the words. - I also taught him about boats. - Boats? Yes. I used to sail on a freighter. - You must have seen lots of countries. - Yes, quite a lot, over 15 years... The sea makes me seasick, just looking at it. Still, it's good for bathing in. You don't know what it is. In Marseilles? That'd be unfortunate. Once, just before the kid... I had a friend who was a steward on the "Ile-de-France". - You're not too uncomfortable? - No. Then goodnight. Goodnight. You know, a steward is not a sailor. I don't want you to go away... What do I owe you for board and lodging? Nothing... It's alright as it is. I'd had no intention of taking him with me. Well then. He must learn to live. At 12, he knows nothing. He's never been in town. He's only lived in the country, and with strangers. You can't say that's normal. It's better he goes before you're too attached to him. Yes, it's better. All the best! Come on. Simon? This is for you. What is it? You coming? This is Marseilles. And I live there. 48 Accoules Rise, 3rd floor. Hello, Marie. - A new lover? - No, my son. How tall he is! Mrs Bernard, don't you find Marie's kid rather tall? It's the normal height for his age. How old is he? He can read already. You can only count. Oh, Marie... that's a funny sort of client! He's my son. I fetched him from the mountains. I have to say it... Can you believe it, Sister...? The Good Lord has lost His mind! This is where you'll sleep. A room for you alone. No sheep. Climb the stairs! Wipe your feet before you come in. Shut your door. Put your things down and undress, you need a good bath. Come on, stand up. - Where does the water come from? - Out of the tap, of course. After, how do you empty the container? The container? You look like a container. It's a bath, not a container. You pull out the plug and the water goes down, maybe to the sea. - Into the sea? - It has to go somewhere. Your legs! - Shall we always be together? - Always. - No one but us? - No one but us. Here, go on and rub hard. What are you doing here at this hour? Wipe your feet! Your shutters are open. I said to myself... "She's alone, I'll spend a moment with her." Silly! It's my son. - Your son? You have a son? - Yes. - Who did you have it by? - The Pope, on a Good Friday. Good-looking kid. Come around 9.15... He'll be in bed. What'll I do with my wife? - Send her to the movies. - No, no. That wouldn't be nice. I'll do like my friend Garsier... I bang the table in the middle of a meal... well, after the cheese... ...and I storm out the door. You always have to put the blame on them. That way I'll be back home by 11. They ask your forgiveness. In the morning, you'll go down to get some croissants from Victor's. It's the cafe up from the newsagent. And we'll have breakfast together, eh? You must be sleepy, eh? Good night, my darling. Oh you kiss so badly... This is how we kiss... Now you try. Again. I'll make something of you yet! To turn off, it's there. Goodnight, dear. There you are, kid. He's Marie the Paris girl's son. - He looks like you. - So? I look like everyone else. Mum! - I saw the sea. - So what? Sit down and eat. Hurry up, we have errands to run. I would've left him at his godfather's house... - But a mother... - I doubt it. When you're lucky to have one... I think he'd like a rub. - It'd be my pleasure. - You're too kind. 45 proof is enough, for a kid of his age. Oh dear. He's not going to drink it, anyway. Your wife's in a foul mood, There are days when she's not customer-friendly. Monday, as usual? Of course. At least you're customer-friendly! Come closer... That's it... Great! It's not compromising, for me to be in the photo? - I thought you were in Cassis. - Can't I say hello to you? - I see you have company. - Silly...! - Sir. - Doff your cap. - My son. - No!? By what chance? Great. One more. Great... - Ready in 2 hours. - Thank you! Can I buy you a drink? Not right now. He wants to see the sea. - The sea? - Yes. Not that one... the real one. This one's too tame. You've never seen the sea? It's like you weren't weaned. Come along, sonny... I want to be the first to show you the sea. We'll go for a walk along the Corniche. Then, if you have nothing to do... ...we'll spend 5 minutes at your place, if you closed the shutters properly. Then the three of us will have lunch... Alright? Thank you. - Mum...! - Yes? - Tell me when it's the sea. - Sure. An amusing boy. He wants to make it a surprise. - It's funny... - What? Right now I'm thinking "I'm with my wife and the kid." Believe me, you have to be single to give yourself a pleasure like that. I like you because you're always in a good mood, like me. See you...? So much the better, Don't see you...? Too bad. Maybe we're happy because we don't love each other. We like each other, not love each other... ...so nothing matters. It's amazing. Simon, the sea! Over there, dummy! What do you think? He's speechless. - Just bow down to it. - Do you think it's pretty? How about a walk? No, I hate that... the sea, and with this wind... Mum, look at the boat! Yes, sit down. It's an ocean liner. - It's a mixed freighter. - You know about things! Not just that... He also knows the Bible. Eh, Simon? The Bible? That's precocious for his age. That's really something. Remind me to buy him one. His is out in the country and as he gets bored... I'll give it to him now. I want him to have fond memories of me. So a Bible... one! How horrible! Simon! You're crazy! He's a real little beast. He was going to knock him out. What got into you? No one hits my mother. At last, a man to defend me! Hey! There's two of us. We won't be long... Wait for us. There you are. You have a cold nose. "Cold nose, warm heart", as your grandma would say. - I have a grandma? - Sure.. - But I've never seen her. - You'll see her in Paris. Do you know that you're a real little homebody? Your bath will be ready in 3 minutes. Looks like you've been doing it all your life. Do you remember when you arrived? I said I found you in a virgin forest. You looked like a Red-Indian and you ate with your fingers. No, leave it. Not staying in bed today? No, it makes me fat. How have I managed without you? I get up, everything's ready. It's just amazing! Show me your mouth. No it's nothing. The electricity bill. They are never late. Electricity? Sure, I pay for electricity. I pay for everything. I pay for water, gas, I pay for the walls, and the holes in the walls. Everything has to be bought and paid for. Don't let that stop you from having lunch. But where do you get the money from? Well, I work. Doing what? I'm busy at a lot of things. I do business. I do dressmaking. What do you think the sewing machine's for? How's my bath? It's not 3 minutes yet. I'd like to have some money. What would you do with it? Go to lunch. - Alone, just the two of us. - Just the two of us? In the meantime, I invite you. - For lunch? - And dinner. Finish your croissant, get changed and let me get myself ready. Come on, they're not interesting. I'm worn out. Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde, the department stores... Wouldn't you like to sit down on a terrace? Waiter, 2 vanilla ice creams, please. Mum... Oh, thank you. Thank you, Sir. - Albert! - What? - How are you this morning? - Fine, Sir. Gently... I'm sensitive. - Hello, Mr Paul. - Hello, Simone. How are things? - OK. - What's new? - Nothing. You, Mr Paul? The same. - Was it good yesterday at the Alcazar? - I didn't go there. I played bridge. You? I just stayed at the hotel. I waited for Fred... He didn't show. I got drunk on my own. - Goodbye Mr Paul. - See you Simone. That'll do. - See you tomorrow. - Till tomorrow, Mr Paul. - Are we going? - You didn't eat your ice cream. I don't want any. - Shall we go? - Yes, we'll go! You're in a rush. Goodbye, Sir. - Come on, Mum, it's not interesting. - Alright! Damn! I forgot something. Go on up and don't do anything silly. We were supposed to have lunch at the restaurant. Another time. Buy some ham and pate... I'll be right back. And buy yourself a cake too. Come in, little mouse. You took your time. Which way did you go? I went past the florist, then the fish shop. I turned at the shoe repairer, then the caf? street, the street with trees and the photographer street. You have a way of directing yourself... What about the blue signs on the street corners? - Blue signs? - Yes, on the buildings... ...with white letters. How do you like my dress? - Pretty, eh? - Yeah, sure. Wipe your mouth and comb your hair. Someone is expecting us. Who? A gentleman who wants to know you. The one who gave you a light yesterday at the cafe? How do you know? That's amazing! There's no need for me to tell you anything any more. It's going to rain. Is it going to rain? Yes, look at the sky. Do you also know the weather? Where did you learn that? From Gilles. I bet you it won't rain. Don't play with that... You'll break it. What a sourpuss! Aren't you glad to go out with me? Here is my son. You see, I didn't lie to you. Take a seat. - What would you like? - Whatever you're having. - And you? - A chocolate ice-cream. I thought he was a nephew or a neighbour's son. A week ago he was in the country. He was raised by his uncle... a big landowner. Since you love boats, take a look at this man... He's a navigator... Isn't that amazing? If you study hard, you can become like him. Thank you. - It's a nice job, you know. - What do you do, exactly? I navigate. That right? We see the country. One day, we are here, one day elsewhere. And then the sea, one has to say, is a living thing. Here... - You know what it is? - A compass. - Who taught you that? - Gilles. Gilles taught him everything he knows. It's a compass, but also a lucky charm. My mother gave it to me, when I left to go to sea. This compass has gone with me everywhere... ...even during tough times. This is a nice ring. Yes not bad... as a memento. Can you read hands? Don't tell me anything. I love the unexpected too much. There is one thing certain... your hands smell like almonds. You seem to know your stuff. Me? Not at all. Mum, it's raining. Oh, just great! Waiter! - He's a regular little sorcerer! - Why? He said it would rain. You haven't eaten your ice-cream. - I don't want it. - Call me a cab. Shall we go for a drive, before going to dinner? - Dinner together? - So? - Lousy weather! - It won't last. It's almost over. It's beautiful, though. Well, of course, it's a harbour. Eh? The beautiful sea! A short walk? Longer, if you like. I love it. And with the breeze, it's... Stop here. - You getting out? - No, I'm happy here. As you wish. Follow us. It's lovely. It smells like iodine, don't you think? Are you leaving soon? Not right away... I'm on leave. I'll be going on a new boat, the Gallieni. The ship hasn't been launched yet. I've got lots of time. - Aren't you cold? - No, I like this weather. What are you laughing at? Nothing. I was thinking of the story that you told me. - The elevator story? - Yes, it was terrific. Do you have a cigarette? - Well? - Well what? - Not too disappointed? - Disappointed? Yes. What do you think of my home? Not bad. Do you think you'll like it here? I'll tell you tomorrow morning. - Like something to drink? - What do you have? - Brandy or champagne. - Is your champagne brut? I wouldn't offer you anything else. Champagne then. Right away. Oh, I forgot you, honey-bunny! I haven't said goodnight. Forgive me. - Why are you looking at me like that? - Nothing. Yes? No... Don't open the shutters. Take some money there in my bag, on the dresser. Go for a walk. I need to be alone. - We don't have lunch together? - No. - We don't have lunch together? - No. Go and find something to amuse yourself, Darling... Be a good boy. Howdy, kid. - Not having lunch together? - No, I'm eating alone. - Is your mother sick? - No. - Didn't she sleep at home? - Yes. She's tired. Tired... So you drink your coffee alone, like a man. Go sit at a table, you'll be more comfortable. Here, eat this... Just right for your age. Yes, eat... It'll give you your mother's strength. We don't ask you the captain's age. Idiotic, eh? Are you reading this? Well, old man... Been for a walk? - Yes. - Where? - Where? - Along the harbour. Oh yes... The boats. So smokey in here! Here I'll show you something amazing. Watch carefully. Pick a card. Go on, pick one. Look at it. - What's your card? - I don't know. Why? Have you never seen cards played? No. Why? That's amazing. What did they teach you at school? Is it true that you're a navigator? Of course. Not like Gilles. What do you mean... "not like Gilles"? Who's Gilles? He's a navigator. Not all navigators are the same. - Want a cigarette? - No, I don't smoke. That with her Bible... Here. Go and get me a bottle of Pernod downstairs. Simon! Bring us some ice-cream too. You gave him money for the Pernod? Of course. There's money over there... Oh, for the Pernod... Yes, I want to pay. Well, if you insist. I say... about your kid... Yeah? He's not going to have dinner with us every evening, is he? Because I, and large families... Next month, he'll go to boarding-school, there's a very good one. - You have to pay quarterly. - With the priests? Yes. He's very late. At the age of 12, he can only read and write. Well, that's good enough. I can tell a friend who has a nightclub in Paris. He'd take him on as a bellboy, and he'd learn life. I didn't raise him to make him a bellboy. What is it you want to make of him? A little upright citizen? He won't make any money by working. - You've never worked? - I'm a navigator. At 11, I nearly had my primary-school certificate. But school isn't a bad thing. I'm not against it. Ah, the Pernod. Darling, for your dinner... buy yourself some ham or pate. - Not eating together? - Not always. You're a man, you can manage. So what? You won't always have your mother. Here, for your dinner... to get used to doing without "Mummy". Yes, Paul is right. Soon you'll be going to school. That's a good thing. Off you go, darling. Behave yourself, eat well, goodnight. And buy yourself a cake. Cakes... cakes... Yes, cakes... Of course, cakes... Didn't you like cakes? Yes... But it took something more than that to get me. He's not here. Come, I'll show you. First I'll cover the walls with white roughcast. Unless you prefer paper. Roughcast is modern. We'd put the bed here, or there. A sofa bed. There, a modern dresser, A table. I'd give you my little armchair. And we'd buy a wardrobe to store your things in. We could set up a bar there. You'd like it better than at the hotel. You'd be at home and you'd have your independence. I have to think about it. Take your time. Tell me tonight, so I can call the painter. It's true that on the one hand, it would be more convenient. - When you want me... - You just have to go downstairs. You like me a little bit, don't you? It has its moments. I love you. Before you, I wanted nothing. Now, I want another life. I don't know... a brand new life... just with you. You understand... I don't want to feel like ...let things just go on... but let it all start over. I'm so happy. Say... this is hardly the time. Why not? At least close the window. It's you... you're here? What are you doing? I was drinking water. You could've said something. We were just talking about you. I found you a school near Toulon... ...out in the country. You can't stay like this. I'll take you there tomorrow. You'll be fine, you know.. - You'll look smart. - You want us to split up? I don't want anything, but you have to learn, for later in life. You won't pay your way by reading the Bible. - Except for the Salvation army. - I'll come and visit, you know. And you'll come here for the holidays. Anyone would think you're sending him to prison with hard labour. It's expensive to send you there. I hope you'll learn well. I want you to become somebody. Education is everything in life. Education is what distinguishes man from animals. Just a moment. It's for you, Miss. Thank you. Hello, Paul? Yes, Darling, whenever you want. Pick me up in 10 minutes at the little bar, I'm done. And tonight? Come to La Belle Escale. You won't be alone? Still come... We'll find a way to see each other. You say you're going to call. I'll wait for you in the little cubbyhole. You know where. Oh nothing. Yes, I sent it with the roses. But I assure you, Paul. See you tonight, darling. - Who's she? - The singer at La Belle Escale. You mean Any Flyn? Have you heard her? Yes, I go there almost every evening. She often comes here. She's the mistress of a so-called navigator... He's made her believe he'll be joining a new ship... ...the "Gallieni", would you believe? What's strange about that? The Gallieni is not yet under construction. It won't be launched for 4 or 5 years. Navigator...! He's no more a navigator than I am a shark. - What's the matter? - With me? Nothing. Why? - You're not saying a word. - What do you want me to say? I am listening to the singer. I really like her voice. I feel I've heard her before. Well, here. - No, somewhere else. - On the radio, probably. - She also sings on the radio? - Don't know. You're the one who mentioned radio. You said you felt you'd heard her... ...so I said it was probably on the radio. That was all. You're funny. - Think so? You're easy to please. - Oh no. - What "Oh no"? - Nothing. You should keep your thoughts to yourself. I just said "oh no". - I know what that means. - Oh, shut up! Let Any Flyn sing. Do you still love me a little bit, anyway? Oh, give it a rest, please! What are you doing there? You should be home in bed. Where are your parents? Off you go, and if I see you again... ...I'll call Social Services... I kid you not! He's standing there all night, looking at the girls. I wonder what he can see. I'll be back with you in a minute. You didn't go back up to Paris? - No, I haven't left Marseilles. - Business going well? I get by. Is it long since you saw Luccioni? - Oh my god! - Oh my god, it's no joke! I'm giving you a bit of advice, that's all. - Inspector...! - It's OK, just stay out of my way. - Who's that guy? - A regular john. And the guy you were with? Nobody... A friend of mine. He asked me for a reference for the "Gallieni". - He wants to get a job. - He couldn't do better. You being in the position you're in? I need to make a call. How are you, Marie? Fine. What are you doing tonight? Because I'm with my daughter. But I'll take her home and then after... - No, tonight, I'm taken. - You always are. - If you warned me before. - "Before"... I don't do what I want... I'm married. I wait for my wife to look the other way. She doesn't warn me. - You want something? - To see Any Flyn. Turn right after the telephone. You made a mistake... the phone's on the left. What are you doing here? I came to settle an account. Are you crazy? If you want to see me, I'm at home. Ignore her, she's crazy. It's about time. See you tomorrow. That better? Finish you're drink. All the same... ...you had a narrow escape, you know. I wonder how you managed to fall. You realised you were on the edge? Or it could have been on purpose... Was it on purpose? Why would I do it on purpose? How would I know? Come on. There we are. You're another man now. What will your mother say when she sees you in this outfit? Oh, she won't say anything. And your father? I don't have one. You don't have one? Everyone has a father. Not me. You know, maybe he died when you were very young. Oh no, I've never had one. You have a mother... that's the main thing. Off you go. Many people can't say the same. - Want me to come with you? - No, I can go alone. You're not afraid your mother's worried? She's never home at this time. What does your mother do? Nothing. She goes out. Anyway... take your things. You're not going to fall back into the water, are you? And don't forget to bring me back my jacket. It's not that it's worth much, but I need to hang on to it. Goodbye. Goodbye. Damn shame! Your mother saw me. Paul! Paul, come back up... Don't be ridiculous! I wasn't thinking. You know how it is when you're angry. I trust you... Come back up! Well damn you, then! How stupid I am! Go back to her, I won't hold you back. You two are made for each other... A bastard and a bitch. You won't put on airs with her, so much. You should have heard what the hairdresser said about you. Scram... and good riddance! That'll teach me. Paul! - Paul! - Shit. Mum! What's the matter? What have you done with your clothes? What've you been doing? - I fell into the water. - "Fell into the water"? This is the last straw! Get inside before you catch cold! After you. Into the water... I swear to you, it's the last straw! Looks like things are better this morning. - I'm going out with Mum. - Oh, it's an event, then. See you tonight, Justin. Where are you going? Don't know. Is your mother in trouble? - Why? - No reason. For two. By the way, when you came to get a bottle of Pernod... ...you paid with a 1,000-franc note. Remember? Well, the 1,000-franc note was a fake. Here, take it back to your mother... ..and tell her to give you a genuine one for me. Your mother will only have to do like me... ...and return it to whoever gave it to her. Counterfeiting is a serious crime. It'll get you 10 years hard labour... ...or more... under our president. Your pot-top. Mum! The banknote Paul gave me for the Pernod... - Well? - It was fake. Mr Victor gave it back. He wants a real one. He said counterfeiting gets you 20 years hard labour. Unbelievable! In the meantime, go close the door and wipe your feet. Get dressed quickly, and we'll go. Where do you want to go? Choose the colour. Today, we don't care about a thing. The rest of the world can go to hell. Bravo! At least you're honest. Come on up! Have you learned to swim, since the other day? I bet you don't know what that is. It's the compass. And this? - That's the chadburn. - What's it for? To telegraph the engine-room. - You've been to sea. - Never. - Where did you learn that? - In the mountains. "In the mountains"? - Yes, with Gilles. - "Gilles"? He's my friend. Well, I must say... you're an amazing chap. You are as smart as me. You had lunch? No. - Is your mother expecting you? - No. Do you want me to hire you? - To work with you? - Yes. Instead of just hanging around, you can help us. And I'll pay you... ...union rate. So, is that a deal, or not? It's a deal. Who is it? It's me. Who are you? I'm sure you recognise my voice. - Come on, open up. - No, not tonight. 5 minutes... No, truly. Tomorrow, if you want, around 6. I'm expecting someone. Again? Heck, before long... Hi, kid! Before long I'll have to request on an official letterhead. Anyway... See you tomorrow. It's really too stupid! I'm so unlucky. The one time that I... All this for what? For what?! For nothing, you see. For nothing. - You don't want me to come? - I don't even know where I'm going. - It doesn't matter. - Alright... Listen, Simon, do me a favour... Walk around the block. Look in all the cafes to see if Paul is there. I'll just... Sorry, I thought you were someone else. Can you do that, Simon? I'll do this side of the street. In 10 minutes, I'll wait for you around the corner. Don't say anything to him. Don't let him see you. I only want to know where is he. What do you want, kid? It's you? What are you doing here? Were you looking for me? You alone? Your mother? Picking up men. Your mother's after johns? It's just beginning... you can tell her for me. So? I saw no one. Have you really looked everywhere? Yes. I'll look over there, you never know. Simon, captain wants you. So, how's it going? Happy? - Learning the hard way? - It's not so bad. You're already looking better than last week. So, have you spoken to your mother? Are you coming with us or not? - Not this time. - Why? - When will you get back? - In 10 days. We're leaving right away. I want to go... ...but I don't want to leave my mother alone. She takes care of you at least? Oh yes. For 8 days, we're together all the time. Well, I'll always settle up with you. What will you do with all that money? - Take Mum out to dinner. - Really? Goodness me! We'll drink a toast to you. You think she'll want to be seen with a ruffian like you? - I bet you didn't tell her anything. - No, it'll be a surprise. Really? Goodbye, Admiral. Maybe we'll see you in 10 days. Enjoy your dinner, kid! Mum! I'm inviting you to dinner. You are? With what money? With the money I earned. - Doing what? - Working. Look... I've been a seaman for 8 days on a cargo ship. They want me to sail with them. This evening, I got my pay. What then? They'll be back in 10 days. They're going to Propiano. Did you hear that, Paul? He's inviting me to dinner. Listen, you...! Why didn't you tell your mother that you'd seen me? Yes, why didn't you say anything/ You can't be trusted. Even though you knew how miserable she was. It didn't matter to you, seeing your mother sad? To know her unhappy? He's great, this son of yours. You raised him well. He's decent. He doesn't even deserve to have parents. My mother was sacred to me. At that time, we had heart. For all I know, you stole it. And if I hadn't returned, how would your mother be? And he wanted to invite you to dinner. It's not worth it anymore. My word! He's jealous of me. You don't think I'm jealous? There won't be any more jealous rages. You're here, that's the main thing. Tell me you're happy. Isn't it obvious? - Here already? - Can I talk to you? You can see that I'm playing. Go and sit down. I'll join you. 3 hearts. I pass. - 3 spades. - I pass. The usual. Play well, you'll amaze me. I found an apartment. To do what with? You were finding my place too small. It's not bad for me at the hotel. To pay 18,000 for that room... - No one's forcing you. - I'm not blaming you. Do you imagine an apartment doesn't cost anything? You have to furnish it, install things... At Accoules, you're a fixture... You're known. If you move... And I'll be going aboard soon. Oh, the Gallieni, eh? - What about the Gallieni? - Nothing. Keep it that way. - Gallieni... - Yes, the Gallieni. Exactly. - Who's bid? - His. Could you put your foot somewhere else? Don't worry... Play. But all the same! I don't like people talking to me when I'm playing. I'm getting tired of being taken for a fool. If you've had enough, I'm not holding you back. I didn't mean it like that. So shut up! Would you mind doing your squabbling later? Just a moment. Darling! What are you doing here? Haven't you had dinner? - I'm having it now. - We'll see about that. Paul, he hasn't eaten... Can he join us? Sure. Why not? - Come on. - No. Yes. Paul said OK. The 3 of us will have dinner. It'll be nice. Have a drink... It'll perk you up. - Nice dinner, eh? - Yeah. It WAS a nice dinner. Enjoy your dinner, Simon? It's a good bistro. - Come here often? - Now and then. Who with? Depends. She's pretty for her age, but a bit overweight, don't you think? Who? The blonde playing footsie with you. Oh, I'm not jealous of some blonde. Hey... Change the subject. Well, here's to you. But admit, you wouldn't mind her, eh? What's her name? - Oh, it's a secret. - I said to change the subject. I've the right to... To shut up. I'm out of patience. No, but... I'm no novice. I've been around and learned the ropes long before you. Watch out... I could change horses midstream. I just said she was pretty for a fake blonde. Drop it! You could regret it. It's true, when I dropped you, you weren't so pushy. Next time, you won't have me feeling sorry for you. You can go around the bistros with your kid... I'll leave you to cry into your salads. - That kid and you... - Don't be angry, it was a joke. I know what makes a man. So behave yourself. But I don't blame you. You're not mad at me, are you? You're mad at me? - Waiter, 2 marcs. - You're nice. And the bill. And what are you thinking about? You don't care? You'd be right. Come on, empty your glass, it won't hurt you. Do you good. Yes, drink, since Paul asked you to. - That's fine. - Thank you. You have to finish it... it's not a party every day. Cheers. Don't break the glass. No, Paul, he's drunk enough. You don't know boys... Show your mother. 1, 2, 3. Cossack style! I'm not thirsty any more. Force yourself... Get drunk for the first time, with me. Go on, drink. Drink, I tell you! Are you finished? Beg yours? Leave that boy alone. It's for his own good. I'm teaching him how to live. Drink up and don't worry about the rest. Did you understand what I said? Leave that child alone. What are you getting into? I haven't spoken to you. If I were you, I wouldn't push your luck. Paul... please. If he thinks I'll let him ambush me, he's wrong. Yes, of course, drink your moonshine! - One could expect some respect. - This marc is pretty awful. You're right... Let's get out of here. It's no place for us. Excuse me Sir, but it's about your banknote. The boss says it's fake. Well, that takes the cake! Well, give him 1,000 francs. Is this ever going to stop? What a stirrer! And you were against me, too. - Me? - "He's had enough to drink"! I avoided a punch-up. What a bastard! If I'd been alone with him... But I couldn't foresee! Shut up! I would've set you right quick-smart! What, "oh"? What, "oh"? Well? Of course, it's easier. Easier than what? Eh? Easier than what? Simon! - You bastard! - I'll kill you! Just you try... you'll deal with me! Now get to bed! - I'll kill him! - Go on! Oh... Show me... - Had to be the right hand! - I'll put some alcohol on it. - That'll burn! - Just for a moment. I'll bandage it... it will be nothing. No, it's not deep. Don't quibble, please! "Not deep." Huh! I'm not dead of course... but it grazed an artery. A bit higher, and that would have been it. Tomorrow, I won't be able to move my finger. I could've been a pianist. What do you expect? He defends his mother. If you can't correct a woman without getting stabbed...! Hold your hand up. We're not often eating here. I'll tell the kid to get coffee, eh? - As long as he doesn't spit in it. - Don't be silly. I would if I were him. So, finished? Give me my knife back. If you want your knife, ask Paul for it. Don't I get a kiss? You can feel pleased with yourself for making me worry. What if you'd killed Paul, where would you be today? In prison. What would I become? - Oh, Paul... - What about Paul? Did you think he was beating me? He wasn't beating me, you dope... It was just in fun. Paul's always been nice to you. The first time you saw him, he offered you an ice cream. I didn't eat it. That's no reason to hate him. Listen, Simon, do you want to make me happy? Tell me... do you want to make me happy? Go down and get us 3 coffees... And say hello to Paul, nicely. Won't you talk to Paul? - At least get the coffees. - Nope. There are times I wonder where you came from. - Where are you going? - To get coffee. He's not ready to. What a world! You'll now be able to execute your corrective. You lie down quickly, flat on your stomach. Legs straight, together, arms outstretched to the sides. You are going to draw circles with your fingertips. Fuck off out of here! Give me back my knife. You want your knife? Come and get it. If you're a man, come and get it. You kidding? Don't touch me, or I'll tell about the fake banknotes. What? Yes, and I kept the 1,000-franc one you gave me for the Pernod. You crazy? No. And last night at the restaurant, your money was fake, wasn't it? Give me back my knife. Great! That's what I like to see! You two have made up? Where are you going? What about your coffee? Not hungry! - What's he still on about? - Nothing... Kid stuff. He got his knife back, though. He asked me, I've got no grudge. That's amazing, after wounding you. Oh, just a scratch... I was a nasty piece of work when I was his age. I was fighting guys twice my size. - I was wild. - All's well that ends well. Your coffee's cold. - Have you had it long? - 5 minutes. Alright. I'm going to see Simon so that he doesn't think... What? Dunno. You know... kids... So, I gave you your knife back. I took it back. You took it back because I let you. And yet, look, after what you did to me... If I get gangrene, they'll have to amputate my hand. Think that's funny? Quite a boy, eh? Tell me... What you said about the banknote was a joke, wasn't it? - Wasn't it given back to you? - Yes. Want to show it to me? I'd be surprised if it were fake. No. - Want to show it to me? - No. - Why not? - Because. Because what? I want to keep it. What will you do with it? You can't spend it. I don't want to spend it. Hey... I'll do a deal with you. Give me the fake one and I'll give you a real one. No. It's not yours, anyhow... It belongs to me. - No. - Why "no"? Mum paid back Mr Victor for it. Oh, you know... Mr Victor... Exactly what did Mr Victor say to you? Did he mention me? No. What, then? He said people go to prison for it. - You won't give it back to me? - No! Don't bother looking, it's not here. - Where is it? - It's not here. Good God, if you won't...! That'd be too awful. Just what is it you want? Just tell me. Firstly, I want dinner with my mother. - You want dinner with your mother. - Yes, without you. Whenever you want, if that's all it is. And as much as you want. - When do you want it? - This evening. As good as done. So you'll give me the banknote? I want the dinner first. Yes, but afterwards, you'll give it to me? I'll see. You'll promise not to show it to anyone, eh? Very well, I trust you. Hey... What if I took it back? No. What? If I wanted to, I could. Take it back. Good God All-frigging mighty! No! I forbid you to swear. And my hand's killing me. Can you get me a cigarette? I can't, with my injured hand. I don't care... You can keep the banknote. What would I do with it, if it's fake? Can you give me a light? My lighter's there. Have you two finished chatting? This evening, you two are dining together. Without me. What would you like for dessert? - Choose. - Raspberry ice cream. You'd already spotted that. Two raspberry ice creams. - What's that? - It's for you. - Oh, a starfish! - Yes, it brings good luck. Where did you get it? - The captain gave it to me. - And you're giving it to me? Yes... It's just for you. Thank you... You're a sweetheart. How's the lovers' dinner going? Fine. We'll be back. I hope so. Waiter... the bill. Well, old man... "Waiter, the bill." What authority! You should have asked me if I was having coffee. - Would you like coffee? - No, I've had quite enough. Hey, take it easy, you're eating your ice cream like wild animal. You have to make the pleasure last. - Like this? - That's it. Say... the 1,000 franc note that Victor returned to you... You've kept it? Yes. I need it. Paul told you to ask me. Yes, it was Paul. I've lost it. You've lost it? You don't think that if you searched for it, you'd find it? - I'm telling you that I lost it. - Alright. We'll agree that if Paul speaks to you about it, you'll tell him... You'll tell him that you gave it back to me, ...and I'll sort it out. If you wish. - Are you finishing your drink? - No. Simon... And I yawn, and I yawn. - I'm not tired. - But you need to sleep. You're a growing boy. Give me a kiss. Thank you again, kind Sir, for this evening... I hope we'll meet again... I enjoyed your company. - I like you a lot. - A man would say a bit more. - Little liar... - Give it back! I thought you'd lost it. Here was me thinking that you trusted me. Give it back! Give it back! Alright then... take it. Go on... take it. I gave it back to you, so make me happy... Give it to me. You can't refuse me. I'll be very unhappy if you don't give it to me. Simon, please. Simon, be nice. Simon, I need that banknote. If you give it back to me, I'll give you a real one in exchange. It's not worth it. See, that wasn't hard. You mad at me? No, I'm not mad at you. Well, sleep tight... and forget about it. Goodnight darling. It's healed. Can you wiggle your finger? It's fine. - Maybe. - More pain? Not much. Is something bothering you? Well, I didn't sleep all night. Because of your hand? No, because of your kid. - The banknote thing. - You got it back from him. I got one back. There are others in circulation. If he talks, everyone will be after me. I'll be history. - I have to get on top of it. - You didn't make them, did you? No. For that you have to be a technician. I only had an interest. Boy, have I got into a mess! I thought I was on a winner for the good life. For once I was going to make money... ...and you turned out to have a kid. What are you going to do? Find a way to cover myself. I didn't want others mixed up in this. You didn't have to force me. I didn't want it. But they've pressured me. To survive this life, one should never have friends. Simon, thanks for the banknote. I'll get you a little present. Did you hear me? Little bastard! If I were you, I'd leave as soon as possible. - Why? - You never know. - There's a train around 8.30. - OK. You can hide out in Paris. I don't think you'd have a chance for 6 months, around here... ...but sooner or later things always die down. I thought there were never any leaks in your organisation. I wouldn't say "never"... "rarely". I'm sure of my men. Your pals were sure of you. You gave them away. Moral: we're sure of no one. - It's not that I'm scared. - But you have fears. Eh? Nothing wrong with that. Get going... it's no use worrying about it. Well... goodbye Inspector. Have a good trip. - No one's asked for me? - No, Mr Paul. - Make up my bill. - You're leaving? For a few days... ...on a business trip. Have it ready when I return. Who is it? It's about your son. This is Francois, captain of the freighter. Hang on, I'll be right there. - What is it? - Is Simon here? No, he went out early. He was working, but he left without warning... ...and my revolver has disappeared from my cabin. So I came straight here, hoping I'd find him. - You'll catch cold. - No, I'm used to it. George, please. - Excuse me. - No matter. Where might he be? I'm not worried about the revolver, but what he might do with it. He's the sort of kid who... how can I put it... ...is capable of making a stupid mistake. You're right. Thanks for coming... as he might have been here. I'll try to find him. If I see him, how can I let you know? Yes... well... Call me at the Cafe Anglais, on the Place de la Bourse. - Sure. - Thank you, Captain. Who will I ask for? - Mrs Marie. - Marie... Just that? Yes, that's how I'm known. I can't wake up this morning. Want my seat? No, I'm off to Toulon. Going to enjoy bouillabaisse with a friend of mine, I'm meeting. I slept like an absolute log last night. Marie couldn't get over it. Trumps. It's what I get for sleeping at home. Enough already...! We've got the message. Raise you. I'll take a shower... It'll wake me up. So we won't see you tonight? No, as I said, I'll be in Toulon. You haven't seen Paul, by any chance? - He was here 5 minutes ago. - Did he say where he was going? Just that he was dining in Toulon. Why? I have to find him. You only saw him a little while ago. I didn't seen him this morning. He went out early. - No kidding? - That takes the cake! 3 of hearts. Tell him to wait for me here. I'll check his hotel. - And my kid... have you seen him? - No more of Simon than 4 aces. You've lost everybody. He called in and left right away. - How long ago? - About an hour. Tell him that to wait for me in his room... that it's important. I'll call to find out if he's here. - And you are...? - Marie. - Just Marie. - Very well... It shall be done. Paul, look out! Whadda you know! - Wow... - Wow! - Unbelievable. - Who is this kid? You don't know? It's Simon. Thank goodness for my reflexes. I could've been blown away. See this? It's no joke. Look at the wall. He just missed. Why did he want to shoot you? It was obviously you he was after. I didn't do anything to him! He's a little Red Indian. He already went after me with a knife. He's a public menace. What do you have to revive him? He can't be left here. Just a sec. Wait a bit, there may something else. Little bastard! Go on... don't worry... He won't eat you. - What if he attacks me? - You've got me here... Go on. Cologne... over there. That's not what to do. Feel better? You're not having a chat with him, are you?! Come on stand up. So you still want to kill me? Do you still want to kill me? Go on, tell me! Leave him alone! Are you going to try again? No. It's not worth it anymore. So get out of here. So get out of here, I said! This is no life. - Still nothing? - No, haven't seen him. Yes, are you sure that Paul hasn't come? You don't think you'll see him today? Alright... Never mind. Sorry to bother you. Police. Don't give me trouble... You'll be much better off. So get up... Come with us. - Luccioni? - He's not here. He's not here? Alright, we'll see him later. Come on. Mrs Marie? A man is asking for you at the checkout. - You're Mrs Marie? - Yes. The captain sent me. He told me to tell you that Simon is on board. - So? - Well, then, I wasn't mistaken. - He'd taken the revolver. - He didn't use it? Yes, of course. He'd decided to kill a guy. - Someone named Paul. - He fired the gun? As it turned out, he missed. Not even a scratch. But all the same, he showed what he felt. To go that far, he must have been pretty damned unhappy. Pretty desperate, eh? Yesterday, we had dinner together, he was very cheerful, he seemed... - He seemed happy. - He did? Maybe there was something afterwards that set him off. At that age, we love without knowing... We don't choose our... ...what we call our first love. We're exclusive, we don't give concessions. We don't share. Was he the one who told you all that? We talked. I asked him what he'd done with the gun. One thing led to another... He never told me so much. Yes, that's how love can be. It can't be spoken... It can be sensed. Where is he? It'd be better to leave him, he's sleeping. He'd been knocked out. He'd got a serious blow. It's not for me to advise you, but if I were you... ...I'd allow him to come with us. Did he ask you if he could ship out with you? If I was telling you otherwise, I'd be lying. He's right I'm not much of a mother. But I do love him very much. Yes, I believe you. It's just that... ...he only loves YOU. He told you he fell in the water accidentally. That wasn't true. He ended up telling me the truth an hour ago. - My little boy... - Yeah... This is what love is, when you're 11 years old. My darling... There are boys who must be made into men... But with him, it's almost the opposite. He's a man who needs to be made into a boy. With time, you'll see that it'll happen. We leave tonight. When we get back in months... ...he'll be even sleepier Do tell him though, that I came. Well, I won't forget that boy of yours in a hurry. - I know, I know... - "I know, I know..." Is that all you've got to say? Why were you let up? Why are you packing suitcases, just to go down to Toulon? Where are you going? Please tell me. Everyone has to think I've gone to Toulon, but I'm going to Paris. - I'm in trouble, you know. - In trouble? Yes. And it's all your kid's fault. I want to increase my chances of getting out of the hole I'm in. Time will tell if I succeed. - So you're leaving? - So you see. -Paul... - Paul... - What "Paul"? What do you want with Paul? - Paul's had enough. - Take me with you. I'm alone. - With your boy? No thanks. - No. I really am alone. If you knew... I can't stand it... Please...! Take me with you. Oh... You're too much! How can it hurt you? Take me with you. Alright. If you want. You can brag about having had me until the very end. It's okay, I'll take you. Don't just sit there... Go pack a bag! The train leaves at 8.30 I'll pick you up at 8 o'clock. - You really are nice. - So I'm nice... but get ready! We have to get the tickets. Cast off the ropes! Cast off... So, you feeling better? - We're leaving? - Yes, it's no time for sleeping. Do you like boats? You'll see one going to sea. And besides, you're on it. Up you go, Admiral! On the 4th beep... ...it will be 8 o'clock... ...exactly. Thank you, Sir. - Where are your bags? - Checked in. - You have the tickets? - That was the idea. Oh damn! What a dope I am. Don't go. I forgot something. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
