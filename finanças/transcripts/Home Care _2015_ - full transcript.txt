So young. What a shame. 65... He could’ve been walking again in a month. He died in his sleep. He had a beer in the evening, fell asleep, and was dead in the morning. That’s a nice way to go. I hope I go that way, too. Show me now, so I won’t need to visit you later. Here. So. Alright, the most beautiful leg ulcer in the region. I rub this on it. -Isn’t that dog fat? -Something better. A cure-all. In it there’s... Can’t believe you still believe in that. HOME CARE Mr Hanáček! Mr Hanáček! Get your dog! It’s nice of you to come and help your dad lift his spirits, but we’ve been treating his back for 6 months. You’re not treating him. Just suppressing the symptoms. You’re not after the cause of the illness. But those energies of yours... they’re like sci-fi. Vlasta, her hands really warm me up. That’s what the electric blanket’s for. All you have to do is plug it in. Yeah, but last time I fell asleep on it... You believe in electricity, but not in a healing power. We have proof of electricity. On my father’s butt. Keep this as a souvenir. ...Today a bride, tomorrow a wife, and tonight wedded. -We’re not getting married... just yet. -Good choice. Life with a woman is double the bill and half the fun. Come here, get up... so your ovaries don’t get cold again. -Mom, please! -She has to be warm down there. Her ovaries and bladder are so prone to infection. -Have some more bacon. -You know I don’t eat meat. Not even sausage from a German Shepherd? Last time she had it and was barking through the night. Till morning? -You need nutrients. Open your mouth. -Mom, stop trying to take care of me! Sit back down, it’s ok... Let’s sing a happier song. My wife’s died, I’m a widower... I had her buried under the juniper tree. You don’t know it? What do they sing in your parts? Pop songs from the eighties? I’m so worried about Marcela and she doesn’t even... I sometimes feel like she’s going to send me to an early grave. Oh, please. With my bad luck you’ll outlive me. Do you think she’s happy now? If she isn’t yet, she will be soon. I just want her to be so much. Could you take me to Komárov today? There are no buses and I’m afraid to go through the forest. You’re afraid of it? If they want you there, they should pay your fuel. Or say you did more than you did so you have money for fuel that way. I can’t do that. Our healthcare is barely staying afloat as it is. It definitely won’t fall apart because of you. Marcela, come give me a kiss goodbye. It’s too bad you all have to go. But I need to hurry off too. We’ll drive you... at least to your first patient. No. You’re not gonna waste fuel on me. It’s okay, come on. At least we’ll be together a bit longer. Go on. You won’t be riding in such a limo with me. You’ve got it all over you again. We’ll have to tape the diaper on. Such a stud would make even Brigitte Bardot shit herself. You took a bath? Fuck, Mirek, what are you doing here in the middle of the forest? -We’re building an underpass for frogs. -What kind of bullshit is that? An EU project. They put 2 million into it. 2 million to frogs? The forest is here for people, not the other way around. It’s total bullshit. Frogs are gonna have an underpass here. Who’s gonna teach them to use the underpass? I’d also be interested to know that. Mr Hlavica? Hello? Are you here? Hello! Why don’t you sleep in your bed? -Can you hear me? -Don’t touch me with those dirty paws. -It’ll just be a small injection. -Don’t touch me! Leave me alone! How long have you been in the water? You’re gonna have bedsores. Let’s go, come on! Get out! Let’s go! I’m calling the police and they’ll take you away! Well, make it quick then! If you open up, I won’t give you a pedicure! Mr Hlavica. Don’t be mad at me anymore! I just missed the last one. Couldn’t you come get me? Vlasta, we spend more on driving than you make. There must be an official way... through the hospital. Call an ambulance. That’s only for patients. See you at home. Bye. Awful weather, huh? -You know why we call you Speedy. -Don’t be afraid. The boy’s gonna need rehab. He broke a lot of bones... unlike you. But when we were cleaning up the rip in your stomach, we found something. The blinker. And something else. A tumour... metastasizing. Do you drink a lot of alcohol? No, I prefer wine. You’re a nurse, aren’t you? For home care. But still you know what this means, right? Blinker. I wanted to give him some wine, but he’s not getting it now. Láďa? Do you want to go for a walk? I can’t right now. I’ve been waiting here for the bus for four hours and nothing. Maybe it’s delayed today. Good. Almost, almost... We’re going for a walk. "Dances for Women -Harmonization of Life Energy -Tearing Down Stress" Try to remember a poem, something we learnt as kids. The itsy-bitsy spider went up the water spout. Down came the rain... Hello. Right this way. Come on, Valinka. Well, you can go home. We’ll keep her here. -It was only supposed to be a check-up. -It was. We’ll send for her things. -What’s going on? -The nurse has to go. Come back inside. But I’m going with the nurse. We’re going home. The nurse was just accompanying you here. Come on. No, we’re going together. We’re going home. Vlasta! Vlasta. Five... maybe seven months. You mean half a year? The damn pancreas. We can’t do a thing. Not an operation, radiation, or chemo. I can at least get you something for the pain. I already have it. -Now you just need to take it easy. -Take it easy? For what? You can go home. Girls, please... Nice dress. So you don’t wrinkle it. Thank you. One, two, three... We’re gonna turn around. And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, now the other way. Four, five, six, seven, lunges. And your hands! We’re gonna turn! One, two, three, and clap! One, two, three, other way! Shimmy... three, four... pull back. Other side. Up, and lunge... now! Hello... Wake up... hello... They just gave me pain killers. Those don’t cure anything. They’ve already written me off. You’re a strong woman. You can cure yourself. You can try anything, but it should make sense. You, an educated nurse, and you believe in this shit? Natural healing, energies... oh, please. Look at this. Try to bend it back. -Bend it back how? -Just bend it back. I’d have to clamp it down, support it here, and... or heat it up... -She warmed it up with just her hands. -Her hands? Like this, with her three fingers. -What are you saying... you’re crazy. -I saw it. What did you see? Someone warm this up with three fingers and then bend it? Yeah, I saw it. How’s it possible? It is as solid as Reformed Church! Not even Superman could bend it back. -And you say with three fingers. -Give it to me. -That’s bullshit. -For me, it’s not bullshit. That fucking mould, you could spray that all day and night, couldn’t you? First this mould, then come the parasites. Always something to do. It’s good that Vlasta helps you out. -With the drinking, too. -She’s always been helpful. Vlasta! -Vlasta! -Vlasta, come over here for a bit. I was just saying what a great helper you were. -This is the Irsai... -Irsai. -Is it sulphured? -Why? Can you taste sulphur? -Actually I can’t. -Just a bit. What was necessary. -Good. -I did good. -You’re getting better. When you say things like that, it really warms a guy up inside. Don’t have a stroke from it, Mr Mayor. How much you got? Not much, just for me and my wife, 350 litres. Well, I have to have some more. -You’ve got more relatives. -I have a bigger vineyard. You do like to brag, don’t you? Oh please, you consider the truth bragging? -In your case, yes. -That’s why you’re the mayor. This, don’t bring her into it. Don’t bring politics into this. Alright... come help us out with this. A disease is the soul’s calling for help. With every disease our soul shows us that something isn’t right. A sore throat develops because we didn’t say what we wanted to say. We suffocated ourselves and that’s how we got the sore throat. Instead of killing it with antibiotics that also kill a lot of healthy cells, search your soul and look for the cause. So a broken leg means my soul didn’t want to go to work? -It’s more about the principle. -The bulk of the work is mental, not physical. When you repair the real, inner cause of your problems, the physical manifestation of these problems will disappear. That’s how she helped me with migraines. I got divorced, and since then, nothing. What’s your name? We’ll wait. Pancreas... that absorbs sugar. You don’t know how to accept the sweet things in life. That you just give and don’t care enough about your own needs. You also need to learn to accept love. It’s not about me so much, but it’d be rough for Láďa... He can’t cook or even do the laundry... Does that hurt you or Láďa? Think about yourself! Raise your feet! We’re driving over the frogs! Mr Hanáček! Mr Hanáček? Mr Hanáček, you should be lying down. I can’t leave these out there. That aspirin really worked well! Check the shelf under the parakeet. Those hands really warm me up. Protect it. We’re gonna turn! One, two, three and clap! One, two, three, other way! One, two, three. Jump! And shimmy! -Láďa? -Yeah? Are you asleep? I was... I’m sorry. Goodnight. -Sweet dreams. -You too. Lupus vulgaris. Tuberculosis skin lesions. So that’s the end. Just like on the Internet. It’s just a scrape. And a little irritated. But what about the blood here? I had a tumour there, so I cut it off immediately. You cut off a pimple. You’ll have a hole there now. -This is why you dragged us out of bed? -Better safe than sorry. That’s why we have health insurance. You’re so lucky you’re disabled. Otherwise I’d knock your head in! It really pisses me off how you’re always so nice. Sorry. Say sorry to yourself! It’s how you destroy yourself. Yeah, this is all because of your patients! Your eternal service, sacrifice, care... Shut the fuck up! Come here. Wait, you have it in your hair. You need to learn to relax. To lupus vulgaris. And suddenly you’re much prettier. -It’s okay, I’m holding you. -Wait, I’ll get off. Wow, that smells horrible. How much of that can you make me? It’s quite precious... Since it contains... you know what. That’s what makes it so good. How about half a kilo? -I’ve only seen you here at Christmas. -I’m just here because of a patient. Your faith will heal you. Well, I’d like to know how that’d work, since my patient’s terminally ill. -Does she believe? -In what? And if she doesn’t? So that’s it? Don’t eat it yet. Happy birthday. If you’re held up somewhere... and there’s not a pay phone... and no more buses... so... Thank you. -Can I open it? -Of course. -It’s stuck. -Wait. Fuck, it’s really stuck. -And why didn’t Marcela come? -It’s not a big birthday this year. And does she know yet? Please, I don’t want her to be worried even more. -If you don’t like the sweet ones... -Only men don’t like sweets. Whores, booze, and sandwiches. Those are our hobbies. -Do you visit whores often? -Of course not. Láďa is great. He just has really stupid jokes. Because your wife now needs love and care instead of booze and sandwiches. When was the last time you kissed her? Láďa isn’t much of a kisser... but... when was the last time he gave me a kiss? Probably at our wedding, right? Too much licking... But now you could try it again since it’s your birthday. This is stupid... come on. He got upset. I’d like to wear something more daring now and then, maybe with a low neckline, but there’s never a chance. Láďa won’t go to the theatre, -and it’s not proper for Christmas. -You can be more daring with colours. Walking mustard. Don’t you have something pink? To show the whole world that you love yourself. -Alright! -I got it for Marcela, but she left it here. Beautiful. Happy birthday. -You should tell her. -What? That I’m wearing her sweater? Thank you. Láďa! You could’ve at least said goodbye. What is this supposed to be? -A reclining bed. -What’s that hole for? To put a bedpan under it. And the mattress? And how will you get it out now that it’s welded? You’re just waiting until I die! To have your peace back! Wine is better than water I am better than I was I’m still alive and will go on To live to be 100. Cast aside all your prejudices and your view into your soul will be clean and sharp. Submit yourself. Láďa, I can’t right now. I’m going to look into my soul. Please don’t embarrass yourself. You’re just like that crazy Valina. -I’m coming to take you home. -You don’t understand it, so stay out of it. -I don’t bother you with your welding. -Vlasta, this is ridiculous. What’s ridiculous is that you don’t understand me and you’re thick-headed. Submit yourself, cast off all prejudices and your view into your soul will be clean and sharp. Now go... look inside yourself and find the cause of your illness. What is it you’re afraid of now? Go! I’ll finish her off so she doesn’t suffer. Vlasta... Vlasta? Vlasta? Vlasta... What is it? My God, what happened to her? Don’t just stare. Bring me my bag! And some cold water! -Can I say something? -Uh-huh. That frog was a piece of shit. Maybe it’s some piece of shit inside you. -Well, at least you’re fine. -You’re also going to be fine... and your motorcycle too. If you want, I could arrange disability retirement for you. But I’m not disabled, and I’ve still got another 10 years to retirement. Plus what would all my patients do? Charities, hospices... But they need some uplifting words too. An enema is better than a thousand words. There’s no money for home care anyway. So I’ll pay for the bus myself. And also... we’ll save money for pills. Nothing? It hasn’t got better even a bit? We can only give you pain killers so you don’t suffer so much. -But I don’t have any pain. -And what are you taking? -Nothing. I got some pain killers, but I don’t take them. -And you really feel no pain? -No. I know how to suppress it myself. You should be suffering at this stage... Vlasta! You look like a walking corpse! I’m going to prescribe you something. -Vlasta needs to raise her blood pressure. -Come on, Vlasta. -Oh, really? -We’ve even healed the haemorrhoids. Healed them, huh? You don’t heal anything, any of you. Oh, of course. You poison them with pills, and just suppress the symptoms. -Vlasta... -Give me that. You stick band-aids on their broken souls! What are you staring at? Let’s not get into this here. Láďa! Láďa! If I die, cremate me and spread my ashes here under the flowers. No funeral. We lived here together, conceived Marcela and raised her here. This is my place. -Have you been drinking? -Yeah. That’s all you’re going to say to me? It’s about your mom, but I can’t say it over the phone. When can you come? Alright, goodbye. Mr Hanáček, what’s wrong with your dog? Your dog. It doesn’t want to eat me today. I’m taking everything. And you won’t need the electric blanket anymore. Hi. I couldn’t pick her up back then, so she got on the motorcycle. -She’s going around to patients on a motorcycle now? -No, Speedy drove. -And at the frog underpass they crashed. -And what happened to her? She tore open her stomach. The doctor said she was lucky. -But it’s actually not about the crash. -What do you mean? She could’ve died. Why didn’t either of you tell me? Shit. Marcela? Do you need something? Why didn’t you tell me about the crash? I didn’t want to worry you. You’ve got enough worries. And they’re all from your care that I haven’t needed for a long time. And did it ever occur to you I might need yours? You don’t even give me a kiss unless I ask for it myself. But I can’t expect to live long enough for it, can I? Pretty excited about getting there, huh? But this one’s already reserved. Thank you. She must like you. She doesn’t usually give private sessions. It was really nice of you to put in a good word for me. I’m glad you asked for it yourself. Stupid frog. Go on, froggie. Go on. Go on, don’t be afraid. Gross. There’s no time for "gross". -I can’t. -Think of it as medicine. -And it is medicine. If Láďa saw me... And every morning from now on. -Want some water? -Thank you. I can feel it... the heart chakra. It represents the relationships to yourself, to others and to the world. Now it is much more in balance. This is a dead tree. That’s you. The old Vlasta. What now? Think about it. But that’s the past. Do you think you’re really ready to go on? They keep telling me how it’s getting worse. But I feel much better. -They don’t understand it at all. -They’re just interested in the body. But we are healing your soul and they can’t help you with that. -What do you mean my soul? -Your inner you. But not my body? -I thought you were healing it all... -But yes, when we heal her inner self... We can’t do anything with the body anymore if it’s in decay. But you need to heal your soul for your next lives. But I need to be alive now! I have a husband, daughter, patients! I don’t want any future lives. I want this one. Don’t give up now. I can do whatever I want. I die either way! -But you can die prepared. -Prepared? For what? I thought you were helping me! No, Vlasta! Vlasta! Here you set the temperature to 170. The timer’s here. Close it real good, it’s tricky. Washing machine... spin dryer. Towels at 60 degrees. In summer you can use the prewash. Oh, and don’t forget... the hose in the tub. Like this... good and to the other corner. Let’s see... yeah, that’s good. Okay. If you have to do it yourself. Today someone’s coming for training, as you requested. That’s nice of you. Do you want any morphine? I’d rather have a coffee. Mr Pazderka! Mr Pazderka! -Have you been here long? -You can walk? I can. But I have a phobia. -Of walking? -Of falling. -So I served you here, got groceries... -I only go to the kitchen and toilet. ...washed, cooked, brought you everything from the hospital like an idiot, -and you could’ve easily gone there? -It’s just for the assurance... Here’s your assurance! Let’s go. It holds better with the tape. Help me turn her towards the light. Do you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour? On her right side, I meant. Sorry. Thank you. The women really like you. All of them? I’ve heard it’s coming back in fashion now. Thank you. Alright, neighbour... Another one already? Better one in the morning than none all day long. They’re coming. Vlasta! He didn’t get cold feet. We’re going to have a Praguer in the family. -You’ve got fly guts everywhere again. -Hi... Another man down. Just as water is to the thirsty and bread to the hungry... Already done eating? Eat up. Gazelles... Giraffes... Careful with the cakes. Show me your leg, so I can see what that cure-all is doing for it. I’ve got a rabbit for you again. Bridesmaids like little roses! Láďa... don’t drink anymore. Now, ladies and gentlemen, my wife reminded me now we should toast with Marcela’s slivovice, the plum brandy I made when she was born. I buried it in a jug back then, but my wife didn’t remind me to dig it back out now. I reminded him! But since morning there hasn’t been any time for slivovice, right? No, no, no. No time for digging! Because the wedding came a little quickly. If you’d left me here alone for 5 minutes, I’d have found the exact place. Just like that idiot, Štěpánik. He searched for water with a divining rod and then we dug a 30m deep well. It’s similar, but without the divining rod, just hands, and more accurate. Sure, more accurate. I’m such an idiot. Oh, no... Sorry. -It can’t be apricot brandy, can it? -No, it can’t. They’d know it. Everyone knows apricot. Wait. Wait... Blow on it. Blow on it. So, to the newlyweds! To the newlyweds! Thank you, Daddy. You look beautiful in it. -I think a girl. -A girl. Vlasta will try. Friends, now one more surprise. My wife... Come on up. -She made... -A song... -...a song. A surprise. Alright. It was a difficult birth You opposed it with all your power But you were a beautiful child Like a cherry tree flower In the hard years of growing up There was nothing to cheer you up Despite wishing to hold you tight You still cried all through the night I wanted to provide you a safe haven But it almost sent you to heaven And when you left home so soon I cried my eyes to the moon But I hope now you’ll have a happy life Having found your husband Robert And living in faraway Prague as his wife My darling, my wife.
