That day... They crucified the lord of glory. And everyone left. But those who believed that he's a god... They sat right there, in front of the cross... Staring at him with teary eyes. Right then... Mary brought an egg... And told them that it is the symbol of the lord's rebirth. She also told them to protect the egg at any cost. No one believed in her. But exactly after three days... God came back. This world can crucify us at any moment, just like it did to God. It can whip us to death. But... For those who believe in God... He will come... He will! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Tell me this... You've planned for two whole months... Travelled all the way to Kolkata from here... And looted a museum over there. What's with that! Of course, you are a fool. But that Nayar is a bigger fool than you. Let's leave him and move to a better boss. Let's make movies with Mahesh Babu. Dude, open the dashboard. - What's in there? - Just open it. Open the bag and take the contents out. It's an egg. So what? Nayar waited in front of Kolkata museum for two months... for this egg. We sketched it for six months. To loot an egg! You've sketched for six months to loot an egg! Swiggy will send half dozen eggs in half an hour. Let me give you a bumper offer. I have free coupons too. Stop blabbering. Take the egg carefully into your hands... And open it this way. My pants will get ruined. Shut up and do as I say. Long back in Russia, a man called Faberge... ...made 69 such eggs. For the kings of that land. Today, only ten of them are left. It's one of the most valuable antique pieces in the world. Now Nayar owns it. It's called a Faberge egg. Where are we going now? MP Janardhan is buying it. For how much? 2 lakhs? 200 crores (2 BILLION). 200 crores! Enough of staring at it. Put it back. - Hey! - Didn't you see the speed breaker? The hell with the speed breaker! You can't even handle an egg properly. That is why Nayar excluded you from the robbery plan. I'm suffering from a migraine that day. Understand? Put it back. I told you not to smoke in the car. But you did it anyway. And now I'm having a headache. Because of a cigarette? Man, you are the real headache to everyone around you. - Stop the car. - Huh? Go hitchhike. I'll turn back, right now. Don't irritate me. We are on an important job. I don't care. This is my car, my wish. - I told you not to irritate me! - Stop! - Hey... - Stop! - STOP! - Have you gone mad? - Stop the car. - Listen to me... - Stop! - Watch out... A lamb! Are you scared? Nice catch, right? Bloody fool... No. 4, do you have AKM bullets with you? No, I don't. The truck is here. Go. OK, brother. - Open the lock. - GOD IS THE TRUE SAVIOUR. THE DANCE OF FATE Hi... Hello... Namaste to all the cooking warriors. Don't stir the eggs with a spoon... Cook them at medium temperature instead. And they will shine with a golden color. That's the speciality of this Shakshuka dish. Now everyone thinks that Shakshuka is an Israeli dish. But back in the day, North Africans and Tunisians... ...fought over the credit for this dish. To prepare for your kids' lunch boxes... You won't find a more tastier and healthier dish. Recipes are just like humans... No two of them are same. [BOTH]: Good morning, pastor. Just like how we can find happiness in small things in life... Just like that, we can prepare great recipes with simple ingredients. But when we are cooking something new, we should keep our heart into it. If we are not careful enough, the final dish will be at danger. Where are you going so early in the morning, Shilpa? This is my usual time. You are the one who drinks whole night and wakes up late. Your husband also drinks with me. Keep watching... One day, I'll make Chinna Rao sir fire you. - Go... Mind your work. - As if I'm staying here all day! Too much! Please, Chinna Rao sir... I asked them to park here, as your parking spot is empty. Give me just 15 minutes. They'll leave. How can you be so calm about it? Suppose... For suppose... If there is no place in my house for my relatives to sleep... Can I just bring them to your house? - What are you talking about? - Yes! This is how the president talks. Why did we come up with rules? To follow them, right? I don't want to see this car here when I come back. Ramu, come here. Now, off the stove... And serve the dish, hot. Like and share if you like this recipe. Subscribe my channel for more variety of new recipes. This is Anupama & Guma Guma. - What happened, sister? - Nothing... I saw Padma going upstairs while we are shooting. She haven't come down yet! No matter how busy you are, you always have an... ...eye for what's happening with the neighbours! Why do you even care? Padma... Yeah... - Can you come down once? - Yeah, coming. I wanted to shoot a 'Thank you' video with the family for 1 million subscribers. - You have to convince them for it, OK? - Yeah, OK. Come in, sister. Come in. Why did you go to the terrace so early in the morning? Sun drying rice chips. You keep drying rice chips... Your husband keeps trying nice chicks. You can start a cooking plus flirting channel. What happened, Anupama? Chinna Rao has an affair with a girl. - What are you talking about, Anupama! - Shh shh shh... You took a bus to your home town this 14th, right? - Yeah. - She took an auto here that day. Her name is... Ahh... Sa... - Savitri? - No. - Ba... - Bagyalakshmi? No! - Jahnavi. - What should I do now? You dry rice chips, as if you don't know anything. I'll come up with a plan by the time they dry. OK? Come come... Go. - Who's that, so early in the morning? - Padma sister. Did SHE wish you, or YOU did? As if I'm that free. She wanted to see my dish, and I said 'Ok'. That's it. I swear! OK. I have to go to the office a little early today. Serve me some tiffin. Varun... Get up and go brush your teeth. Can you start or end a day without gossiping? - Hey... - Just asking. We can think about ourselves anytime we want to. But the happiness that gossiping gives you... is on another level. The egg went away in a poultry truck... Why can't I find it even through this telescope? - Is it paining? - Yeah, brother... A little. Do you want me to massage it? - It happened so unexpectedly! - Huh! Suddenly a lamb came onto the road and... A lamb? Just in the blink of an eye... I lost... Lost control of the vehicle. Who asked you to blink to start with? In our line of work, we can't close our eyes even in death. I told you so, right? We have been careful. But the lamb came out of nowhere. So it's the lamb's mistake, isn't it? What's the truck number? - I didn't notice, brother. - You didn't notice! Then what did you notice? It's a blue color truck, brother. Huh! Blue color truck... And? 'God is the true saviour', is written on the back of the truck, brother. Is it? You are driving a car and a lamb came onto the road... Bhoom - An accident took place. This is the truth. But he said that you have been careful, right? That's a plain lie. Do you know what being careful means? The egg that we've planned two months to rob... Delivering it carefully to the location I've asked you to. There is another way to say it... 'Being smart'. Just like me. What? Huh? Listen up... I'm giving you one week... OK? Get me the egg by then, or else... Let's kill both your mom and dad. And then your wife, who's in the hospital, ready for delivery... There is a small baby inside an egg in her stomach, right? Let's kill it too. Then let's move on to your wife. If you are alive after all that excruciating pain... I'll finish you too. For this not to happen... Go get the egg at once. Tell me, how many eggs get delivered into the city every day? 3 to 4 lakhs. Is it! Make it quick. Or else, someone will make an omelet out of our egg and eat it. Let go of him... Now! He should run. Hey, relax! Breathe in... Relax! Relax! Go get the egg. Go. Hey, stop! This is not comical in any way. I'm warning you... Go. Don't tell them that you like the girl right away. OK. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Shilpa... Shilpa... - What, sister? - Just come! Come in. Let's have some tea. Sister, I have a lot of work to do. I still have to go to Baby madam's flat. It's OK... I can't have tea alone. - Just ten minutes. Ten. Come on... - OK. 'Shilpa'... Such a nice name. Thanks, sister. My husband says the same. Who are all those people visiting the neighbouring flat? - I've never seen them around. - They are... You know Rajanna's daughter, right? She got married to some guy and went away. Then they fought and she came back. They are planning to get her married again. Your job is superb! You'll know everything about everyone. Great! Only if I work for them. But you'll have more information, just sitting at home. - Namasthe, Firoz. - Adaab, sir. (NAMASTHE, SIR) Lately... Firoz seems to be getting weaker. Any health problem? Nothing like that, sister. He and Saira madam keep fighting all day. Very badly! - They are fighting? - Yeah. Go on - Go on... About what? She keeps worshipping god all the time... She's not taking care of Firoz sir. One day, he even hit her. That day, I kept cleaning the bathroom until they are done for the day. Saira... Brother, tell me this... Where do you deliver the eggs to? Only to Feroz's shop. Where is Feroz's shop? Careful with the eggs! Oh god! You made me a loss of 500, first thing in the morning! Forgive me, brother. The Faberge egg from the Kolkata museum got stolen last week... The fact that it got replaced by a duplicate egg... ...came to the police notice after it's too late. The robbers came through very tight security, unnoticed... And no one is being able to crack how they did it. You have one of my eggs with you. Shut everything up until I find it. Watch some TV if you want to. If you are scared... Just be silent. - OK? - OK, sir. - Close the damn shutter. - Close it. Search! Open it... It's suffocating in here. Brother, we haven't found your egg in there. No luck, brother. You only have three more days left. If you don't find the egg... You'll be half-boiled! Understand? Go! - Look after the shop. - OK, brother. - Hello, Padma... - Tell me, Anupama. It's time to catch your husband, red-handed. - Make it quick. - What area is this? - Where did you bring me to, Anupama? - Let's go. - Come on. - Is it really my husband? - Then where is his bike? - God! He's not visiting some friends... We would be careful about it, right? Maybe he parked it at the temple in the next street. Come on. Sister, stay here. I'll go in silence like an inspector from Crime Patrol... And break the door at once. - Then you come in, OK? - OK. - Ready? - Yeah. Dear... I can never get this happiness at home. Wow... You are so hot! - Sister, come on... Fast! - Run! God! What happened? No! What happened! Get up... God! What happened? Anupama! He got a stroke! My god got a stroke! - He's just acting. - Shut up! I came to see this flat with furniture on rent, Paddu. - Is it? - Sister... He's still acting! Listening to her made me give you a stroke! Please forgive me! God! - I'm leaving, Paddu. - Please don't say that! I'm leaving, even before eating your sun-dried rice chips, Paddu. Oh, God! Time for our separation is here, Paddu. God! Sister... Sister! The doctor said that it's a near miss. My husband lived, as his heart is strong like my love as a wife. It's my bad that I've listened to Anupama. - Namasthe, sir. - Thank god! - Namasthe, sir. - Hmm. You all know why we are meeting here today. So, let's get to the point without wasting any time. - Tell me. - There's nothing to tell. You saw what happened, right? Her overindulgence almost killed me today. He lived, as his heart is strong like my love as a wife. Why does she even care about our personal lives? No one out of our family knows about my daughter... ...and her husband thinking of getting separated. Then how did Anupama came to know about it? That's how she is! Tell me this, Shekar sir... Your wife hit you last Thursday, right? It's OK, tell us. Do I need to, Chinna Rao sir? I've heard Anupama telling the milkman about it. Of course, she might have. We are classy and private people. Can we be at peace with people like her in our apartments? Right! You lived, as your heart is strong like my love as a wife... Stop it! Shekar sir... Either she leaves, or we all will. Let's decide it right here, right now. - We support Chinna Rao. - There you go. - Send them away. - He's not agreeing with it. For sending them away... God is not agreeing with it. Pastor, if you get to know what she did... You... Shut up, you sinner! How many of you never committed a mistake? Did you forget about the sins you've confessed in front of me? Forgiveness is a great quality that God gave us. Without it, God should punish each and every person here. But God is not doing that. He's forgiving. Who are you to question the path that God paved? If I put out all your mistakes... None of you will have the right to stay. Should I? We all respect our pastor Daniel Babu. He asked us to forgive Missus Anupama Mohan. So we are excusing her with a strong warning. - What do you say? - You are right. - Padma, let's go. - Let's go. Why are you standing in silence? You already did all that's needed to make me a fool. - Sorry... - Don't even talk! Why do you even care about their lives? What should I do to put that inside your dumb brain? You are always looking to gossip about others! Don't you have anything else to do? You can't even cook properly for our lunch boxes. Sometimes, you don't even pack any food at all! All that comes out of this is throat pain. Concentrate a little more on our home, and a little less on others. You have a husband and a son to take care of. Did you forget about that? Peek out of the window one more time... And I'm dropping you at your mom's. Have your - dinner and - sleep... [KIDS]: Hi, Varun... Bye, aunty... - [KIDS]: Bye. - Bye! Sister... Sister, wait up. What's with the last night's meeting? The watchman told me. You know Chinna Rao, right? I thought of getting his secret affair caught red-handedly. - But it got reverse fired onto me. - God! Everyone took the chance and targetted me. They cooked up all random complaints. So sad! I don't care about them. But my husband got really angry with me. - Sorry! - He's not even talking to me now. He didn't even eat properly. I feel really bad! Anyways, you are used to all this, right sister? Sorry - Sorry! Let's go. I got scared that they'll send us away for real. Daniel Babu saved me like a god. - Our pastor! - Yeah. - He also visits our colony sometimes. - Is it? He talks greatly about God. He did the same thing last night also. I was too tense to understand anything. Firoz sir's wife, Saira madam is also attending his prayers every day. Firoz is arguing with her not to. Is it? They've been trying for a long time now, right? GOD'S WORSHIP HALL - Hallelujah! - [PEOPLE]: Hallelujah! We all want God to come back onto the Earth. There's not much time left for that to happen. God is coming. God's arrival day is near. Paying back for your sins is your only way to get to God. Don't delay it. You don't have much time. Come on... Right now... Right here... Who's ready to wash away their sins? Who? - Who's ready? - Me. There is a sinner among us. Go on... I... I made my husband suffer. Will God forgive me? Jesus loved lambs from the very beginning. He used to have 100 lambs with him. Lord used to take very great care of them. One among those lambs wanted to go home a bit earlier than the others... It took a shortcut and got lost in a forest. It's dark all around. It froze with fear, not being able to take even one more step. Lord get to know about that... He left the 99 lambs behind and went in search of that one lamb... He found it, took it close to his heart, and took it home. - Praise the Lord. - [PEOPLE]: Praise the Lord. Even we commit mistakes at times. We might get lost in the darkness. Lord touched even those who committed a mistake. He will take them close and hug them with all the love in the world. All are equal in the eyes of God. This poor lamb is once a sinner. But not anymore. [CHANTING] Her sins got washed away. Lord forgave her. Jesus! Amen... Amen... Mohan... Sorry, Mohan. I'll never forget to put food in your box. I'll get Varun ready for school on time. I won't even go to that window to start with. Once, I'm a lamb that's lost in the woods, Mohan. I lost my way into the darkness. But God came for me, leaving 99 lambs behind, Mohan. He washed away all my sins. Look at me... I've changed. Believe me, Mohan. Thank god, you smiled! I felt like crying, seeing you leave for office without eating anything. I too didn't feel like eating anything all day. But I got hungry and ate a little. Come, let's eat together. I've prepared all your favourite dishes. I told you not to... Why did you go? What's wrong with attending prayer meetings of God? How dare you talk back to me! I can do anything for kids. You talk as if all this is my mistake! YOU are the reason. Understand that. God knows who's the real reason. So you are saying that I'm the one at fault! You can't have kids. Your sister can't have kids. It's in your bloodline! - Don't you dare... - Shut up! I can't handle all this right now. You spoiled my name in the society. I'm ashamed to say that you are my wife. Repeat this and I will kill you! I'll better die than be your wife. - Kill me right now. - It's my mistake... No no... The mistake is not mine. It's your mistake entirely. Just kill me! God, what should I do? I'm handling this since the day we got married. I can't do it anymore. - It's the same with me too. - What the hell are you talking about? Don't you get it? You don't know how to respect your husband. - Is this what your mom taught you? - Stop blabbering. - What kind of human are you! - Yeah, this is how I am... Why did you call me, sister? What happened, sister? Why do you look so dull? That's... Did you see something again? Firoz did something to his wife. Sister, I resign. Bye! - Hey, stop! - What else should I do, tell me! It's true... You told me that he hits his wife, right? Even my husband hits me. When no one is watching, I hit him back. - So what? - Why didn't you tell me this earlier? OK, forget all that. I saw them both fight last night. In the morning, Firoz locked the house and went out. What about his wife? - That's... - Also... He used to go to his shop by this time every day. Today he just came back. He's home right now. I smell something fishy. She might have gone home. You are imagining too much. I can just smell a dish and crack the recipe. That's a god-given gift. There's no chance of my nose going wrong. Sister, stop it. Sir might get even more angry this time. He won't know about this. Just help me with something. With what? Go to work in Firoz's flat... and check everything in the house. You might find a clue. My husband is way better than you. Every time he promises me about not drinking again... He'll take at least a week to fall off the wagon. - You are too much, sister! - Please listen to me. For one last time! - Please go... - Sister! - Please... Do this for me. - No, sister... Just go! Why is the shop closed? What do I know? This is Firoz brother's shop. It's his wish to close or open it. Don't try and act smart... You know about the egg we are searching for, right? What egg? I know nothing! I always had my doubts about you guys. - Speak up... - Firoz brother took it home. - I have nothing to do with it. - Where is his house? Where is his house? Come in... Come! - Go on. - There's nothing like you imagined. Everything is normal. Madam went to her hometown. Is it? Print that flat key on this and bring it to me. What are you talking about, sister? They'll hand us to the police if caught. I can't do it. Shilpa... If what you said is true... There's nothing to worry about. But if my doubt is proved right... We'll be famous. The same apartment people who blamed me... will praise me. - Sister... - Please do this for me. Please! - I'll make you a bread omelet, OK? - Sister... Please... Go! Thanks a lot. I think we are doing a mistake. Think of it once. Not at all... Don't be scared. Brother, I got the egg. Where are you now? BR Nagar, Gulmohar apartments. - I'll be there within one hour. - Make it fast. Yeah, can you hear me now? Gayathri called me saying that her Tata Sky is not working. So I came to check. Do something... Heat the fish curry. I'll be there in 5 minutes. OK? Jasmine flowers? They should be somewhere around. Take a proper look. Will you say 'Yes', Gayathri... Or will you say 'No'! Anupama... What's that sound? Why are you sweating so much? Nothing... I just... I just came back from a walk. Oh! You are trying to get slim for the cooking videos, right? Nice... From tomorrow onwards, call me too. I'll join you. Anu! What's with the cut on your hand? Nothing... A small accident in the kitchen. We shouldn't neglect such things. Come on, let me give you some first aid. - No... It's OK. - Come on, Anu. Just come. - Baby... - Just come! Come on, Anu... - Baby, it's OK. - Wait here. - Anu... - Yeah. I'm out of town during the last committee hall meeting, Anu. I felt really bad about what they said about you. But I know you, right? - What happened, Anu? - Nothing... I forgot to off the stove. Varun is also alone at home. It's OK. - Thank you. - No problem. I'm getting late for the last one week. Lots of work at the office. - Is it? OK. - I got promoted. - Congrats. - Thank you! Anu... Anu... Anu... What are you doing? Nothing... Just trying on a new sweater. Check if everything is there. The traffic is too much out there. No one follows rules! - Anu... - Yeah. - What are you doing? - Coming. It's getting late. Come sleep. Why did you wake up late? Didn't you get proper sleep last night? A murder took place in B block last night. You know Firoz, right? Someone killed him. Police are here. They'll investigate us too. Don't talk too much. I'll go for a jog... Anu! Anu... Should I bring anything coming back? - Watchman... - Sir? - Who's bike is this? - No idea, sir. - Prasad. - Sir... Note down the bike number and get me the details. OK, sir. - Good morning, Joseph sir. - Good morning, madam. Don't forget about the doctor's appointment at 8 this evening. - Sure. - OK. - Drive safe. - Done. You should be resting, madam. After delivery, I have to be at home anyway, right? Until then, let me do my duty, sir. Anyways, what's the crime scene status? Cold-blooded murder, madam. We found a bike and pair of shoes at the apartment's back gate. Don't know who they belong to. I've sent Prasad to get the details of the bike. Isn't anyone home at that time? Only him, madam. His wife Saira is not in town for the last two days. We informed her, madam. She's on the way. Let's go, madam. Come on. - Second floor! - Yeah, madam. Second floor. - And there's no lift! - No, madam. - Let's go. - Is it OK? Works for me, Joseph sir. You are the one who's about to retire. When are you throwing the retirement party? Your call, madam. That day... You brought a sweet... What is it called... Ha! Putharekulu... It's a mandate in the party. For sure, madam. Here... Keep these tablets with you. - OK, madam. - I'll definitely forget to take them. - Deep cut. - Yes, madam. There is a heavy injury on the head too. - Any signs of robbery? - No, madam. Madam... Firoz's wife is here. Get her some water. - When did you leave? - Day before yesterday. Does he have any enemies? Or... Can YOU think of anyone who would have done this? Anything... Why does anyone want to kill him? We need your help for the investigation. It's better you stay nearby until then. Do you have any close ones here? My friend Kusuma is in the C block. I can stay with her. We'll meet you again if we need any other information. Be strong. We are at the steps for a long time last night, sir. But we found no one suspicious there. Maybe someone came in before or after I was there. Can you tell me what time? I'm there up to around 10 - 10:30 sir. Anupama, I'm just telling him... That I'm here last night. You are here with me, right? Come, tell him. Come on, Anu. She is our apartment's detective, sir. Anupama, what are you doing out at that time? Walking, sir. Who else is there with you? - No one, sir. - Do you walk every day? What block do you stay in? That one. Do you see anyone suspicious around here while walking? - No, sir. - Try to remember well. I saw no one, sir. Anu, how's your hand doing? What happened to your hand? A small cut while cooking, sir. I did the first aid myself. The cut looks deep. Is it paining? - Yeah, sir. - Hey... Anupama? You are the Anupama who makes cooking videos, right? Anupama & Guma Guma. I'm a huge fan of yours. By the way, I'm Pallavi. Investigating officer. The fish fry you made last week... I tried it out yesterday. It came out superb. Ah... cravings. - What month? - Seventh. Two more months. - Is it your first? - Yeah. Very excited. Also a little nervous. Everything will be fine. Just be relaxed. Thank you. - Let's go, sir? - Yeah, madam. Bye. Hey... Someone killed Firoz sir last night. How! I just stabbed him a little... and he died. You killed him so easily! I didn't kill him. Just... Just this? You stabbed him to death! No, I didn't. I just stabbed him. He died later on. So there are two bodies in that flat, is it? Why are you screaming? Why did you bring him like somp from a hotel! Would have left him there. What do I know! I failed to think straight at that time and got him here. I told you not to... See where it ended. Me, for supplying you with the key. You, for murder. We both are done! Don't get tensed for nothing and make me tensed. Both of us will go to jail soon. My husband is also not in town. Shilpa, nothing of that sort will happen. I've cleaned everything. No one will doubt us. You never gave me the key. I never went into that flat. OK? Move... Move aside. Move... Move! Seems like marks from a body being dragged. Right, madam. That corridor, this staircase, and the exit... Check them thoroughly. And send these blood samples to forensic. OK, madam. The murder took place in B block. The body is also found there itself. Then... What's with these marks? The CCTV camera is pointing towards us, right? - Where's the security room? - It's nearby, madam. Let's go. - This is it, madam. - This? Where is the security? Security... Come here. - Madam... - Since how long are you working here? Five years, madam. - Do you have the footage? - Yeah, madam. - Show me. - Please come, madam. I can't see anything. Shall we go a little closer? What? I can see my entire future. - This is it, madam. - Show another camera... Do you think they found something? They seem serious. What else? They are talking about you. Shut up! Scared for nothing... Careful, madam. Come on... Let's go. Ranganna, what happened? Someone took away the CCTV footage, madam. God saved us. But who took the footage? Who is she? She's superb! She seem so 'country'. Dead body, brother. - Mani? - Seem so. Why is he sleeping inside the suitcase? She's a dangerous bird! Maybe she killed him for the egg. - A block... 402. - Brother... Get there fast... Cut the bird's throat... And get me the egg. Understand? Go now. Madam, he is Ali... He works at Firoz's shop. Someone intimidated him yesterday and took Feroz's home address. Yes, madam. All of this is just for that egg. - Egg! - Yeah, madam. Something is shining inside the egg. Faberge egg! But, madam... How would it end up at their shop? In a poultry truck, sir. Firoz sir took that egg home. Details of the bike we found behind the apartment, madam. He's Mani. He's already an accused in many robbery cases, madam. He's out on bail. Is he the one who intimidated you? Yes, madam. He came with his gang earlier. They even scared Firoz brother with a gun. - Go search this address. - OK, madam. He won't be home. But give it a try. - OK, madam. - Also... - Trace that phone number. - OK. Forward an alert on that photo to all the police stations in the city. - OK, madam. - OK, madam. So... There might be a link between him and the Kolkata museum robbery. The egg that is missing from the museum ended up in Firoz's shop. Mani got to know that and might have killed Firoz for the egg. Mani took away the CCTV footage... But why did he leave his bike and shoes behind? This doesn't feel like a regular crime, Joseph sir. We are missing something important here. Tighten security around the apartment. Allow no one new inside without proper ID and permission. Right here... Stop... Stop. Watchman... Watchman... - What? - A small work. Will be back in five. The police ordered us not to send anyone. No! - Just for five minutes. - I'll just be back. Sir, please come tomorrow. Try to understand. We are already under a lot of stress. Hello... Hey... Did you find my egg? In the name of investigation... The police went in. The watchman locked the gate. No one is allowed inside. Shut the hell up! Hit him, get inside, and find the egg. It's risky, brother. There are police in there. Listen... At least inquire about her name and phone number. Please! OK, brother. I will. Such fools! Boss, flat 402 in A block is on sale... Madam told me so. What's the status of it? - 402... Is it Anupama madam's flat? - Yeah. They are not vacating. We are buying it. We are here to pay the advance. We want to talk to Anupama, but you are not letting us in. Sir, please don't mind. Come again tomorrow. - I'll send you in. - Tomorrow? I beg you... At least give me Anupama's number. Of course, sir... Just a moment. OK... Who took the footage, sister? Why do we care? Let's do something and dispose of the dead body tonight. Only then we can be at peace. I'm really scared, sister. - Hello! - Congratulations. Congratulations! What for? Breaking news! In Gulmohar apartments, killing a man brutally... A woman stuffed the dead body inside a suitcase. Here is the footage of her dragging the suitcase like she's on a holiday... What happened, sister? Who's that? Sister... Who's that? Sir... Sir... It just happened, sir! My intention is not to kill him. What the... It's him who attacked me first... Sir, I just did this... And the fork went piercing into his neck, sir. My intention is not to kill him, sir. I'm innocent! Just... Stop it! I hate cries and tears. That is why I never got married. Don't waste my time... Just get my egg and hand it to me. - Egg... - Egg! Oh, yeah! Did my husband get an egg from your shop, sir? Are you freaking kidding me? Huh! - I'll cut your braid! - Sir... I really don't understand what you are talking about, sir. You don't understand! What's happening? - Sir... - All that is still OK. But why did you kill Mani? Sir, I just told you, right? It's just an accident, sir. Enough! Enough of your drama! I don't have a problem with you killing Mani. All I want is the egg he has with him. Sir, why do you keep saying 'egg'! Don't you know an egg? It's white in color. But this is not a chicken's egg. It's an egg that will make me filthy rich. It'll be in his pocket. Search properly. What? - There is an egg in his pocket. - Egg! Hey... Just check. - Is it there? - No. Sir... Sir, there is no egg in his pocket, sir. Search all the pockets properly... It will be there. Before you killed him, he told me he got the egg. Search! Sir, we found only his purse and the bike keys... What happened? Sir... He... He's alive, sir. He's alive? Hit him on his head and ask him about the egg. - OK, sir. - Do you want some tea? Shut up! Sir... Sir... The man on the phone is asking about an egg, sir. Please, tell me where it is! Hey, hit him until he answers you. All we need is the egg. Where is the egg, sir? Sir... Please answer, sir. Please, sir. Tell us where the egg is. Ask him! Anu... What are you doing? Nothing... We are trying to remove this rod from here. Even I stomped on it last time. Let me take a look. Mohan, let it go. It's OK. It's OK, wait. Sir, it's OK... That's it! Jogging every morning fills your body with energy. Go take a look! - What should we do now? - God! Answer it... - Oh god! - Talk to him... Go on. Hello, sir? Did he talk? Sir, he... - He went back to being dead, sir. - What the hell! You silly bird... Do I look like a joker to you? Do you know the value of that egg? 200 crores. I can kill someone for just 100 rupees. How many times should I kill you for 200 crores? I almost got the egg... But you messed it up. I don't care if it's with you or in Firoz's flat. He's saying something! If you don't get me the egg by the end of the day... I'll kill you, slice you into pieces, stuff you into the suitcase, and... Calm - Calm - Calm! Do you believe in god? Sir? Do you believe in god, or not? Do you really believe in god? That egg should be in my hands tonight... Or else, even your god can't save you from my torture. I'm such a monster! Shut up! Do you recognize him? No. Did your husband ever tell you about an egg? Egg! I don't understand. An antique egg that went missing from the Kolkata museum. No. - How is it related to the murder... - Your... Your husband found it by chance. They might have killed him for that egg. Feroz never told me about that egg. Thanks for letting Saira stay here. It's nothing. Saira is a good friend to me. The Faberge eggs that went missing from the Kolkata museum a few days ago... The police speculate that this murder is related to that heist. They also state that they'll get to the end of this, no matter what. - [NEWS CONTINUES] - It's in the news too. Now the flat rates here will drop. Let's buy another flat and rent this one out. What say? - Hello! - Hey... The police found out about my egg. If someone has to step out of that apartment from now on... Observe them carefully. Understand? - OK, brother. - Close to that apartment... Book a super suite room. It should have a clear view of that apartment. Understand? I might die out of tension, sister. Ask sir to change the channel. Why are you getting tensed? We can get out of this mess once we get him that egg. - But where will we... - Listen! Last night, I heard him say that the egg is with him. After I stabbed him, he rolled around for a bit. It might still be there. - Inside that flat! - Shh! - Why are you screaming? - There are police there, right? You get out of here, right now. Namasthe. Namasthe, brother. - Did anyone step out? - No, brother. Where did you book the hotel room? Right there, brother. Get in. It is a hotel, brother. They made it look like this to avoid tax. But the interior is really good, brother. - Tell him... - Yeah, brother. He's right. I will be great inside, brother. Trust me. Did you book the room while the hotel is being built! Brother, she's at the gate. Sending off her son to school. - Bye, mummy! - [KIDS]: Bye, aunty! Anupama madam... Just a minute. Are you selling your flat? No. Why do you ask? A guy came to see your flat. He wanted to meet you too. - You are not sending anyone in, right? - No, madam. I'm sending no one in without proper permission. - OK. - OK, madam. Why didn't Firoz tell Saira about the egg? Maybe he's a husband who don't trust his wife. Maybe... But Saira might have lied to us, right? She said she went to her home town the other night, right? Did you cross check? Yes, madam. Checked out. OK. Just to be sure... Check Saira's call history. OK, madam. - Sister... - Listen to me carefully. There is only one constable guarding Firoz's flat. This is the right time to go get the egg. But how? That one constable is enough to catch us red-handed. Shilpa... Do as I say. Understand? Oh god! Why don't you help me out, sir? Do you eat sweets? Or are you diabetic? No, I'm not. Vegetable rates are skyrocketing these days. - Especially tomatoes. - Yeah. Sir... Sir... Did you find the culprit? Do you want my help? I know everything about everyone in this apartment. We'll take care of that. You take your vegetables and go home safe. God! - Raju? - Madam... Go have your tiffin. We'll be here. - Do you want some coffee, madam? - No need. - You go. - OK, madam. We are missing something Joseph, sir. The one we are searching for is right around the corner and are observing us. But we are not being able to see them. This is how I feel about all this. Tell me, Prasad. Mani's house is locked, sir. He haven't been home from 3 - 4 days. His phone's last active location is that apartment, sir. It's active until last one hour. - Then it got switched off, sir. - Last one hour? Did you check it properly? It's the information from the network company, sir. OK. Mani's phone is active in this apartment until last one hour. Then it got switched off. Last one hour? But we are right here, sir! Maybe Mani is still in the apartment. Right, madam. Maybe that is why his bike is still here. So... It's not Mani who took the CCTV footage. It's someone else. There's something else that got recorded on it. Get sniffer dogs, sir. Something is happening here. - What happened? - Just a minute, madam. Mani can be somewhere in this apartment building. Someone is helping him to hide. Check every block and every flat thoroughly. No one should step out without my notice. - Is that clear? - [ALL]: Yes, ma'am. Disperse. They might object to checking without a warrant, madam. The one who wants to hide the truth definitely will, sir. It's them who we are looking for, right? - [KIDS PLAYING] - Hey, go home! - Clear this area. - Move! Sister... The police came to know that Mani is here. They are searching all the flats. Sister... Will you rat me out if you get caught? Don't say that. Let me think. What's there to think about? We are done. We should hide the body somewhere else. Where will we hide the body that's already hidden? I mean, it should be right in front of your eyes... But it should be invisible to their eyes. I don't understand! There... And you sure that they won't search here, sister? Listen, we are cleaning the hall. He's so heavy, sister. Careful... God! Sister, his leg froze... It's not going in! Madam, take this tablet. Open the door. - Sister... - What? - I have an idea. - What's that? Hey... What do you think of me? I can't do it. There's no way out of this. Just cut it off. Have you gone completely mad? How can I cut it? You've already killed him once. He won't be having any more sensation. I'll slap you across your face. I didn't kill him. I just stabbed him. God... We don't have time for this, sister. The police will be here in half an hour. Listen to me and start. - You do it. - No no, I can't. My husband is not in town. I can't! - But how? - I don't know, sister! Start it somehow... Let's continue it slowly. The police are coming. Hi... Hello... Namaste to all the cooking warriors. You can do it, sister. Today, I'll teach you how to cut chicken. Firstly, place the knife on the leg and make a slight cut. After that... Get hold of the leg... Pull it out and will get separated neatly. What, dude? - Dude? - Sorry, sir. Is that you? Sorry, sir. It just came out of tension. What are you tensed about? The police are coming for a checking, sir. The police are coming to your home! Do they suspect you or what? No, sir. They are checking all the flats, sir. How will you manage? What will you do? I got the body into the hall and... I can hide it inside the table, but... - It's a little big for the table, sir. - Is it? - So? - So... I'm chopping off the leg, sir. OK. You disconnect his leg. I'll disconnect the call. Bye. She's more violent than us! She's chopping his leg to hide his body. Very dangerous bird! Like and share if you like this recipe. Subcribe my channel for more varieties of recipes. This is Anupama & Guma Guma. Sister... Sister! The police are here. Sister, you forgot this. Keep it in the fridge. What happened, sir? We are checking all the flats. We think that someone is hiding the killer. Sure. Go ahead. Sorry! Utter another word and I'll kill you both. There is a dead body in our home since last night! Last night it's not a dead body, sir. - Just body. - Shut up! He's not dead when she brought him in. He died when you pushed the rod into him this morning. Why is she involving me in his? This won't work. We better inform the police. No... Listen to me. We can get out of this if we can get him the egg. - But he's dead! - He's dead... He's not. - Who's he? - Someone else. Not him. - How are they related? - No idea. Who the hell is he? - No idea. - Who is he? No idea. Anupama, listen to me. You stabbed him and got him here. And I killed him. We both did what we did unintentionally. But this is intentional. No. This is not right. - Let's inform the police. - Mohan... - Please hear me out. - What? Not here. Come in. Come. Come. What? Anu... Mohan... I... It's... Anu... Anu! - Anu, have you gone mad? - Sorry! - You've lost it! - I can't think of any other way out. Open the door. Anu, open the door. Have you gone mad! Anu! Anu, please open the door. Anu! Is the police checking over? Ye... Yes, sir. We managed to escape it. - Very good! - The egg is not in Firoz's flat, sir. I've searched everywhere. It's not there, sir. Are you kidding me? Huh! If it's not with Mani, it should be in Firoz's flat, right? How can I answer that, sir? Stop acting smart. No, sir... I'm telling you the truth. Sir, please let go of me! I'm a lamb that got lost, sir. Shut up! We are searching for an egg. Not a lamb. If you don't get me my egg tonight... I'll half-boil you! Sir... Sir, please, sir! Now disconnect the leg! I mean, the call. Disconnect the call. God! It's not in Mani's pocket. Or in Firoz's flat... Then where is it? Will God be coming soon? Yeah, he will. And? He will take away all our pain and difficulties. Not just you... Everyone in this world will be happy. Sins will be cleansed. Earth will become heaven. How would we know that God is coming? He will send one... A signal! Babu... My husband found an egg. Is that the signal you are talking about? Egg! Mary brought an egg... And told them that it is the symbol of the lord's rebirth. She also told them to protect the egg at any cost. God will be back for those who believe in him. He will! You took so long to be back! To bless this child! It's OK. It's all OK. You'll be here. You are coming! God is on his way, Saira... This is the signal. This is the signal. This is the signal. Is it? What should we do now? We should protect it. With all our will, we should protect it. But my husband wants to sell it. No! We can't let that happen. No! - We should protect it. - But how? If he finds it missing, my husband will kill me. Then let's kill him. Yes, let's kill him. Kill him! You are an angel sent by God. It's your duty to pave a path for his arrival. Go now... By the time you get back, God's path will be ready. It's not in Mani's pocket. Or in Firoz's flat... Then where is it? We've searched everywhere, madam. No clues found. No clue, madam. I think the police are done with the search. We have to shift the body out of here before sniffer dogs reach. Out of here? With all these policemen around! - How could you do it? - Right! But we have to. OK, bro. - Hello! - Balraju... - What, sister? - Bring the van, urgent! - Did you get a new recipe? - Something like that. - Let's change the location. - Super! And... park the van behind our block. OK, sister. Some investigation is going on in the apartment. Tell the watchman that we are recording a cooking video and get in. - OK, sister. - Show him your ID if he asks. - OK. - Start off. Damn! Why should I even come to work today? Even my husband is not in town. Don't get tensed for nothing. Clean the entire house once I leave. The sniffer dog shouldn't catch any smell. Understand? - What should I do with this knife? - Stab me! Just put it in there. - Balraju, tell me. - Sister, I'm here. Coming. Hand me that. Come on. I'm telling you again. Clean the entire house once I leave. Just to be safe, cut some ginger and chilli after that. Heat them in a bowl and pour some water in, OK? Understand? - Sister. - What? - Swear on me. - Saying what? This is not your first murder, right? You said it's just one episode, right? But it seems like you've prepared for 10. I'll explain later... Take this. Careful! It's too heavy, sister. Babu, Anupama is taking a suitcase out in a van. It's definitely a dead body. If Anupama gets out of this, the police might end up at us. God will take care of everything. Who's on the phone? It's you who killed your husband, right? It's not how you think... - Let me explain... - Don't explain to me... - Explain to the police. - Kusuma, stop! Listen to me... - What happened is... - Let go of me. Kusuma, listen to me. Let me call you back. Madam? - Just a small work. We'll be back. - OK, madam. I'll be back by this evening. Yeah... Hey... I told you not to allow anyone out without permission, right? - What are you doing? - How can he say that? - As if we did something wrong. - Keep quiet. - I don't care. - There is a dead body in the suitcase. Nice joke! No one calls a dead chicken as 'dead body'. Stop the engine. - Open the trunk. - Sir, there's nothing in there. - Yes, sir. - Just some cooking materials. Last night a murder took place, right? That dead body is in the suitcase. What the hell are you talking about, sister! Madam, I can't let you pass without checking. I know your Pallavi madam very well. We are... Stop! Just open the trunk. - Shankar, what's happening? - They want to head out, madam. - I'm checking their van. - Madam... We are going on some urgent work. Can you ask them to open the gate? Just two minutes. Make it fast and send them, Shankar. Will you open the trunk at least now? It feels like Anupama is hiding something, madam. It's good you are retiring, Joseph sir. We just have to live past this one night... God is almost here. You made a scene for nothing. You can go. God, you got we scared for nothing. How blind he should be to not see a body this huge! I've kept old clothes over it, right? Sister... Did you dispose of the body carefully? I'm here to help you... But you did it on your own. It's really difficult for the police to track the body all the way to over here. It's OK. Step out. What should we do now, sister? You too, madam. Anupama & Guma Guma... Please subscribe. I saw the body while I was searching the van. But what will I get if I catch you right there? Just an appreciation for duty well done. - That's not what I want. - Sir, that's... That's... That's an accident, sir. It doesn't matter if it's an accident or if it's intended... A murder is still a murder, right? Sir, let me tell you what happened. I'll be true... I don't want to know all that. Just give me what I want and leave. What do you want, sir? Egg. Sir, everyone is asking for the same, sir. - I don't have it with me, sir. - Enough with your lies! Why did you kill him if not for the egg, huh? Sir, I'm telling you the truth. Some guy is already threatening me on call for the egg. - And now you... - Who the hell is he? The one who stole that egg. What - What! The one who stole that egg is threatening you for the same egg! - Do I look like a fool? - Sir, I'm telling you the truth. - I'll tell you the entire story... - No need. Just wait! Narrate your story to Pallavi madam. - Keep it clear... - Sir... Sir! Sir, please... Sir, what's... No need to stuff that constable's dead body into the suitcase... And cut his hands and legs. I'll take care of it. You go get the egg. Egg! I won't! Do as you wish. But I can't take this kind of tension anymore. Before someone else dies, I'll go tell the police everything. The police can never catch me. I know you'll turn on me. That's why I've kidnapped your son. He's right next me. - I'm teaching him the 7 table. - What! But he's really poor at math. 6 times 7 is 47, right? He says 42! Please tell him that 47 is the right answer. Here, son. Mom, these people got me here from school. Varun... Varun! They got me here. Mom! Did you hear his voice? Varun... Varun! Hello! No Varun... Only Nayar! See... I just want to teach him math. I don't want to kill him, understand? Sir, please don't harm him. Please, sir. I'll get you that egg somehow, sir. Please, sir! Good girl... You don't have much time. And I don't have much patience. But I'll still try to teach him the 7 table. Meanwhile, you go get me the egg, darling. - 6 times 7 is... - 42. He's making me angry with that '42' again. Get me the egg before his answer becomes 47. Understand? Come fast! - Tell me, sir. - Madam... Today Saira called a particular number many times, madam. His name is Daniel Babu. Daniel Babu? I need to talk to you. Please come. Do you know Saira? - I do. - Since? I don't remember. How? She's my disciple. Disciple! Yeah... disciple. She came to me when she was in pain. I showed her the path of God. I need to check your flat... Daniel sir? Daniel sir... Daniel Babu... I need to check your flat. - Sir... - Madam, we got information about a body... ...in a river in the outskirts of the city. The police of that area think that it's Mani, madam. - Is it? - I'm heading there now. - I'll update you once I get there. - OK... I'll also start. I'll meet you again. I did all this. I'm a sinner! Calm down, sister. Have some water. Sister, what's with the wound? I stepped on something in that flat. What flat? That locket... I've seen it somewhere. What locket? Where did you see it? In Firoz's flat... The pastor... Pastor? I saw that locket hanging from his hand during the meeting that day... On the night of the murder... Other than me, Mani, and Firoz... The pastor is also there for sure. The egg is with him. Are you sure about it, sister? Shilpa, take the pastor away from here. I'll tell Nayar to get him. Also, we need pastor's flat key. How can we get it? Pastor, you should come to my home urgently. My mom is not feeling well. Visit our home once and... Just put a hand on her head and she'll live, sir. God came into my dreams last night. God! What did he say? 'I've sent Daniel Babu as your protector'. 'Stop praying for me and go talk to him', he said. God took my name! My name? Just a minute... I'm coming. Let's go. I can lay a hand on your mom's head and save her. Let's go. - Let's go. - OK, sir. What did God say about me? [STAMMERING] He... He said you are the lost lamb, pastor. For... Forgive me, pastor. Shilpa... Shilpa, stop! Shilpa... Stop! Got the duplicate key. I was always happy poking my head into other's lives. But I failed to safeguard the happiness that's already in my life. I'm scared! Don't be scared. Give me the key... I'll go. No... It's me who should go. Your husband is here, madam. - Pallavi... - Prakash! What are you doing here? I asked him to come, madam. You have a doctor appointment at 8pm, right? I'll miss you a lot, sir. No... Don't say that, madam. Bye, sir. Where's the egg? It's a signal that God sent only for me. - Signal! - People like you shouldn't even touch it. So it's a signal... Did he SMS it? Or did he send it on Whatsapp? - Sinner! - How dare you to call me that! I'll blow your brains out. Hello, sir. Send me the knife and all the photos we took around the dead body. OK, madam. Give me your phone. Fast... Hi... Hello... Welcome to all the cooking warriors. Pallavi? Sir... Sir, I found the egg. Get it to me, fast. We got the egg... Time to party! P A R T Y... Party! Just a minute... Listen to me. Just a moment... Varun... The CCTV footage... Hand them over to my husband who's at the mosque in the adjoining street. - Hey... - Brother. Take the footage and 7 table Varun... - And go to the mosque. - OK. Once my husband gives me a call... I'll come hand you the egg. Smart birdy! [SINGING IN EXCITEMENT] Oh, God... Save me! God will come... Just wait. Bloody idiot! - Hello! - Anu... I just picked up Varun. Got the footage too. This door is not opening... I'm stuck inside. Wait, I'm coming. - Anupama? - Madam! What are you doing here? I... I was just... Madam... It's you who killed Mani, right? Yes or no? Madam, listen to me once... Just answer me! Yes, I did. But it's not how it sounds, madam. Listen to me, madam. Let me explain... madam... Madam - Madam... I'm not stealing anything. Believe me, madam. - Please, madam! - Is Daniel Babu in there? There's no one in there, madam. I used a duplicate key to get in, madam. Please believe me, madam. An unknown man is threatening me with my son's life to get this egg, madam. Please, madam. This egg is with Daniel Babu from the start, madam. He and Saira together... Ma... Madam! Madam... Madam! Anu! Anu! - Prasad, check if there's anyone else. - Sir... - Mummy... Mummy... - Anu... Anu... Call an ambulance! Anu... How are you feeling now? I'm not here as a policeman. I got retired. I know it's you who killed Mani. I also know that you are hiding it for a long time. He's a convicted criminal. Is it right to spoil your life for killing someone like him? Look... Don't let this happen again. Or else, Pallavi's death won't be having a purpose. Her death gave you a new life. Use it well. Pallavi madam... I'm the reason for her... Even God won't forgive me. God? What god? Where is he? There is no god present. Definitely not a god with the idea of good and bad. If he does exist... Do you think he'll let Pallavi madam die? How long will we still search for and believe in god? Why do we think that God will come to help us? Love, cruelty, hate, jealousy... Everything that you feel is God. Man is God. A god who's lost in the woods. A god who forgot to look into his own heart, to find himself. He's inside you... Waiting for you to realize that you are enough. You are everything. The god you are searching for... The happiness you are searching for... Everything is inside you. There's nothing out there. Everything is inside you!
