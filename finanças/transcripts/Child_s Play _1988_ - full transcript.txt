[ Screaming ] This is Andy Barclay. Eight years ago he touch off the scandal... that nearly crippled, this copany, claiming that his Good Guydoll, Chucky, was possessed by... Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lakeshore Strangler. Now l ask you, Iadies and gentlemen, after the lawsuits and negative publicity, when the company is finally getting back on its feet, where is the wisdom in putting the Good Guy back on the market? Mr. Sullivan, before this happened... the Good Guy outsold our other toys 2 to 1 . Even now, interest in the marketplace is at its peak. The factoy is up and running again. We should be in stores by next week. We cannot let the fantasies ofone disturbed boy... influence company policy. What if the doll somehow... affects anotherchild in a negative way? You could have a public relations nightmare. One ofthe hardest things about this business is... that it is a business Doesn't matter what we're selling. Whether it's cars nuclear weapons... or yes, even toys. The bottom line is the bottom line And what are children but consummer tranees? Andy Barclay is ancient histoy. No one remembers him. Nobody cares. l have made up my mind. We're moving ahead. Thank you. Okay. Al l right. Mr. Sullivan. lf there's nothing l can say to convince you, then l must go on record. l'm completely against this. Your position is cystal clear, Miles. And you can be sure l won't forget. Just a minute, folks. Mr. Sullivan, we have a surprise. Guys at the factoy sent this over. First offthe assembly line, the Good Guy of the '90s. [ Clapping ] lf there's nothing else, l'm gonna get going. Fine. it's just, my wife's expecting me. lt's our anniversay. Fine, Petzold. l could review the Larrabee report after dinner. Good night, Mr. Sullivan. Good night. [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Ahh_ Despite a downdraft in the bond market, stocks were able to post a rally on friday... thanks to a couple of different factors. Not only did the employment report allay recession fears, but also there was a technical rebound in buying... and a resurgence in deal stocks helped set the tone. Here's a look at the numbers. The Dow industrial's up 16. The transportation average up 3. Utilities bouncing up-- Utilities bouncing up-- ln a moment's time -- Oh, shit. [Tv] Bonds headed south on the economic data, which served to bolster the U.S. dollar. The dollar index up a quarter point. The CRB index up... point 43 at two-thirty point 43. March crude up...
