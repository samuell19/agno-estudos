911. What's your emergency? H-Help. There's... accident... I can't hear you. What's your location? There's been an accident. Please come now. What is the nature of your emergency? Hello? Are you still on the line, sir? No. Kind of ate way too much at dinner. Okay. Very special. Just a little. All right. I'd like to propose a toast. To Christine on her high school graduation and her admission to Oregon University. Cheers. Our little girl's growing up. I love you guys. A little something from your mom and me. Is this what I think it is? I don't know. It's exactly what I wanted! I think that's enough wine for you, graduation girl. Thank you, guys. Um, well, since we're all in such a great mood, I thought it would be a good time for us to talk about something that means a lot to Christine and I. Um, as you guys know, I love her so much, and... and we really feel like now is... is the right opportunity for us to start our family together, and we really want your blessing for that. I think it's important for a young woman like Christine to finish her education before taking a serious step like marriage. Mom, please. I want Christine to have her independence. James, I can't think of anybody I'd rather have in the family than you, but Ellen's probably right. You both should wait. I completely respect your guys' point of view, um, but I feel that... that I've been on my own since I was 15 years old, nd I have a great job t the mill, and I know I can provide in every way possible. James... life is far more difficult than you realize. To this day, Doug wishes that he had completed a proper education. Look, I know that I didn't complete the proper education... It was my education that allowed me to launch a very prosperous publishing company. James, I understand your perspective. I do. I get it, but Ellen's right. You're both too young. Wait. That doesn't sound good. I would like to get home before this gets worse. James, buddy, would you mind being the designated driver? I think you're the only sober one at this table. Yeah, sure, Mr. Webb. That's fine. "So foul and fair a day I have not seen." "Macbeth." James, look, I'm sorry, okay? I had no idea they were gonna react that way. Yeah, well, I kind of expected you to chime in instead of just letting your mom tear me a new one. I mean, we talked about what we were gonna say. Okay, but you did an amazing job in there, okay? I'm... I didn't have any idea tha t it was gonna happen that way. Yeah, well... I'll talk to her. Well, your parents are never gonna respect me, 'cause I didn't get a precious college education like you did. That's not fair, James. Well, I know you're just gonna go and find some trust-fund frat boy and leave me, so... Is that what you really think? James, you're the man that I want to marry. I love you. I would never do that. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. I love you. I love you. Christine, let's go! Watch your step now. Drive safe. Look at our sleeping beauty up there. Doug, don't break her present before she gets a chance to use it. Will you relax? When it rains this hard, it usually only lasts a few minutes. 'm sick f your comments about my lack of education in front of our daughter. I don't like your tone. My tone? Yes, your condescending tone. You started it. You sound like a child. Then stop treating me like a child. James! Ames, there's a train! We don't know if there's any more brain damage. She has a small blood clot... in her brain, so we have to keep a close eye on her. Dr. David, please stop in the west wing patient lobby, Dr. David. Hi. Hey, Christine. It's me. It's Bill. Susan's here, too. Hello, sweetheart. Honey, you've been in a very serious accident. Where's everyone else? James is right down the hall. He's doing real good. What about Mom and Dad? Bill, what about Mom and Dad? Bill, what happened? No. No. No. No. My God! I'm so sorry, Dave. I... Be careful in there. I just mopped the shower area. Okay. I'll just be a minute. Get a move on, girl. I got places to go. Pervert. Dave, where the fuck are my clothes?! James, pick up your phone. Come on. Come on! My God. What? No. Christine. No! No. Fuck. Hi, honey. Hi. Anything from the state lottery? No, no such luck. Rats. Christine got a letter today, though, from the Office of Student Housing. Looks like a dorm probably opened up. Sounds like you're trying to get rid of her. No. I just thought you should know. Do you want anything? Baby, what happened? What are you doing here? My God. How did you get here? You were there! I mean, I don't understand! What are you talking about? At the pool! The pool? I... I heard your cellphone ring there. My cellphone? I told you yesterday it got stolen at the mill, remember? I put it on the table, and somebody took it. I don't know what happened to it. Okay, okay. Calm down, okay? Take a breath. I am breathing, okay? Okay, well... You don't understand, okay? My clothes were stolen, and I tried to call you to get you to help me, a-and your cellphone rang there. And then somebody knocked me in the pool, and then they chased me to the car! Hey, hey, hey! What's going on? How'd you get in here, asshole? Bill, just, please, it's my fault, okay? I'll explain later. Yeah, thanks for the backup, Bill. I got this one under control. Bill, please. Guys, stop. Just please leave. Dickhead. Sweetie... I didn't mean to scare you. I know. I'm glad you're here. I just wasn't expecting you, that's all. Hey... It doesn't make sense. Who do you think did it? I don't know. I don't really want to talk about it anymore, though, okay? Okay, that's fine. I just want to go to sleep. All right. Sorry. It's all right. Okay, night. What are you doing? Nothing. Thought you were going out. Yeah. I am. Here you go. How's that? Thank you. Of course. It's good to see you. So, Mr. Anderson, how's Ryan doing? As you know, he's still at the university studying English literature, and, he's getting pretty good grades, but he still doesn't have a social life, and he spends most of his time just locked up in his room. Have there been any improvements in his behavior? No. In fact, it's getting worse. Worse in... in what way? The violent behavior. Dr. Webb, I'm getting concerned for the safety of my daughter. So based on your sessions with him, what's... what's wrong with him? Well... Ryan is suffering from extreme bouts of frustration that are accompanied by a very distorted sense of reality. During these episodes, he is unable to distinguish real from unreal. In other words, your son has delusional paranoia. Dr. Webb, before we go any further, there's some things you need to know. Well, the truth is my wife disappeared under what they called suspicious circumstances, and to this day, no one knows what really happened to her. What was their relationship at the time? You're sick! You need help! There's nothing wrong with me! Stop it, Ryan! Leave me alone! Stop it! Let go of me! Ryan, you're hurting me! Ryan, unlock the door! I'm okay, Dad. Damn it, you open this door right now! Dad, I'm okay. It was a nightmare. Ryan, listen to me, buddy. Just listen to me, please. You can't do this anymore. I want you o unlock the door, and I want you to let me in. Dad, go back to bed. Ryan, talk to me. Go back to fucking bed! I can't peek? No peeking. None of that. Okay, don't trip. Don't trip. Whoa. Whoa what? I'll tell you. 'll tell you. 'll tell you. Ready? Okay. Check it out. What do you think? Whose is this? This is the bedroom right here, okay? Okay. And we got campus two blocks away, nd we got plenty f time to furnish it, and when we're married, you can move in. It's amazing. Yeah? Yeah. You like it? Thank you. I can't wait to marry you. This has been the most amazing day ever. Well, I got you, didn't I? I wasn't expecting it. James, what would you do if you lost me? What? Could you ever fall in love with someone else? I don't think I could, and I need to know that you feel the same. How could you even ask me that? I proposed to you, didn't I? I know. I love you. I love you. Do I get to pick my fiancée up for dinner tomorrow night? No. I want to cook for us tomorrow night, okay? Okay. I get off at, like, 5:00. Okay. Just come over after. All right. Okay. Christine. Ive me the ring. Give me the fucking ring! My God. Open the door! Open the door! Bill! Open the door! Open the... My God. You're wide awake. What are you thinking? Just wondering who'd stalk my sister. Are you sure that's what's happened? What does that mean? Ever since the accident, she's been displaying signs of post-traumatic stress. I really think she needs help from a professional, honey. I really think she's a strong girl, and she just needs our support. She has our support. I... I just wish you'd think about it. Yeah, sure. Thank you. You know what tonight is? It's a prime night. You want to try? Um, sure. James. Babe, what are you doing here? Sweetie, it's dangerous for you to be here. I told you that. You're not supposed to come here. Please don't be mad at me, okay? What is it? James, my ring was stolen. W-When? Last night after you left, omeone came fter me again. Why didn't you tell me? Who was it? Was it the guy from the pool? I can't tell you, James. I can't tell you, 'cause you're gonna think that I'm crazy, okay? Baby, no, I'm not. I'm not. What is it? James, I saw my father. My father was there, okay? He's the one who took the ring from me. I don't understand. So be honest. Do you think I'm going crazy? Sweetie, you're not crazy. What the hell? I'm on it! James! James! Help me! James! Could somebody just fucking help me! Wait. What... Somebody! What's going on? Saw him again! Hat's... I saw him! He was in here! He was in here! Who was in here? Is there somebody in this house? S there somebody n my house?! Yes! I saw him. James, come with me. Okay, Ed. Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. What did he say, honey? Said he's gonna keep an eye on her till we figure out what's going on. Don't know hat's going on. We checked the place up and down. I couldn't find a handprint, footprint, broken lock, nothing. Honey, this is the third episode without any evidence of an actual threat. Meaning what? Well, you know hallucinations are a sure sign to a psychotic break. Psychotic break? Listen to you. What? She's not making this shit up. I'm not saying she is. Why does this have to be about Christine? It was dark. Anyone could have been there. Where was James when the lights went out? You're taking this the wrong way. You know, I gotta be honest with you. I think you're jealous of her. You think... I'm jealous of Christine? Why would I be jealous of Christine? Because she's getting married, gonna have a family of her own, and apparently that's something that we're having a hard time doing. Fuck you, Bill! Uck you! Fuck you. By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes. You destroyed our family. How dare you disobey me? You're a disgrace. Lying whore. Susan! Susan! My gun is missing! Okay, I'm sorry about last night, but did you take my gun? Yeah. I was planning on shooting you in your sleep last night. This is not funny. This is serious. I can be suspended for a lost firearm. Okay, look, I didn't take the gun. It's probably around the house. I'm telling you I've looked everywhere! It is not here! Okay, last night, when the lights went out, where was it? I know where it was. Prick. Campus security. Ed Young's office. I'm sorry, Mr. Webb. He's in a meeting right now... So then I got out of the pool, and... Watch this. Never turns toward the security cameras. Never shows his face. This is somebody who knows the building, knows the setup, where the cameras are. Is there any way to enhance this? No. It's too dark. But don't worry about it. We turned it over to local law enforcement. Hey're better equipped o handle this stuff. Yeah. Thanks. I appreciate it. You'll be hearing from a detective later this week, okay? Bye. Bye. Hey, Bill. It's Ed. Hey, Ed. Did you get a chance to talk to Christine? Yeah. She just left. Could you I.D. anyone? Nah, but I know who it is. Tell me it's James Campbell, 'cause I need a reason to put a bullet in that kid's head. Who? Her boyfriend. I heard them arguing after the attack. She can place his cellphone at the scene that night. She never mentioned that. She's in denial. That's interesting, 'cause I got two hooded suspects on tape. What? I'm thinking both of our boys were at the pool the other night. Call you back. I gotta go. Okay, Ed. Thanks a lot. Everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, it's good. So how long is your shift? My shift, Donna? Y shift lasts all night. See about that? Johnson! Dave Johnson! Hey. Unh! Johnson! Johnson! Aah! Hey, sweetheart. Hi. You want to talk? Sure. I miss them so much. Sometimes I want to wake up, and it'd all just be a bad dream. Life can be so cruel sometimes. Yeah. What's that? Pictures from my graduation. They're the last pictures I have of them. My family was everything to me. I want to have a family with James one day. Want to have kids nd grow old together. That's my dream, too. Might not ever happen. You may not know this, but... I made a promise to my mom and to myself that I wouldn't be intimate with a guy until I was married. That's a really tough promise to keep. I'm proud of you. I just can't believe they're not gonna be there on my wedding day. My dad won't be there to... to walk me down the aisle and give me away, and my mom won't be there to help me pick out my dress. They will be there. They wouldn't miss it for the world. You have to believe me. I promise. Thanks. All right, come on. Let's put this stuff away. Yeah. Yeah. Get some rest. Yeah. I got it. I got it. Excuse me. Officer Webb? Do I know you? I'm Sergeant Ellis with Internal Affairs. Please step out of the vehicle. What's this about? Do you know a member of the EPD by the name of Ed Young? Yeah. So? When was the last time you had any contact with Officer Young? Called him last night. I didn't reach him. Why? Officer Young is dead, Mr. Webb. What? He was killed yesterday. An Oregon State Police service revolver registered in your name was found at the scene. My gun was stolen. I've read the reports. Excessive force three times. Questionable shootings. This conversation is over. James, stop. You're being bad. Baby, don't. Don't. No, James. Stop! Get off her, asshole. What the... hat the fuck, man? Bill, what are you doing? You could have hurt him! Are you following me? Bill?! Yes, I'm following you. This lover boy's in some serious shit, and now we both are. Ed Young's been killed, and my weapon and James' cellphone were found at the scene. Yeah, well, his cellphone was stolen the other day, so obviously it wasn't him. And you believe that? Yeah, I do believe that. Well, for your sake, I hope he can prove it. Hey, so listen, I got a call from a detective yesterday. He asked if you were working here Thursday. Shit. Are you serious? No worries. I covered for you. Thank you, Mr. Anderson. Hey, listen, I don't want you working with your head hurting like that. Damn, that was a cheap shot. You listen to me. If that Bill Webb gives you any more trouble, if he even looks at you funny, you let me know, 'cause I got some boys that'll put some manners on him. Might have to take you up on that. Hey, could I ask you something, Mr. Anderson? Shoot. Why you always looking out for me? Well, sometimes, I look at you, and I see a little bit of me when I was your age. Tell you the truth, I been hoping some of that would rub off on my son, but... Anyway, help Ryan with the overnight shipment. Then you take the rest of the day off, okay? Okay. I appreciate it. Ryan! Yeah? Come help James. Sure. So my dad says you got engaged. Congratulations. Yeah. Thanks, man. She's hot. I see her on campus from time to time. I bet you do. I'll have to introduce myself next time I see her. Yeah, you should. Hi, sweetheart. Let me know what time you'll be home for dinner tonight. Love you. No more tears now. I will think upon revenge. I'm sorry. I know it's my fault. Hello, Bill. I knew I'd find you here. You think you know me. Listen, I know we didn't grow up together, and I was in the Army by the time that you were born, but, I just thought I would try... They're trying to stop me. What? The messages, they're from Shakespeare's tragedies, all the stories of evil deeds and doomed love. What has that got to do with... Mom's favorite thing in life, her passion was poetry. Can I give you a little brotherly advice? Don't let your feelings for James blind you to what's really going on. I mean, these threats aren't coming from beyond the grave. No, it's not James. It's Shakespeare. She's trying to warn me. Hello. Hey, James has been in an accident. He's at the hospital. My God. I'll be right there. James has been in an accident. What? What happened? Christine, wait! Code blue, room 203. Code blue, room 203. Yes. It's on your right. Okay, thanks. Y God, James. My God! You okay? Sweetie. What happened? I'm okay. All right, somebody ran me off the road, but the doctors checked me out, and I'm gonna be fine. You don't understand. I can't lose you. I know, sweetie. It's okay. Baby, you're the only thing I care about in this world. I mean, why are we waiting to get married? I don't know. Let's just do it. I don't want to spend another day without you. Okay. This mean... Yeah. Okay. Love you. I love you more. Are you ready to kill for me? I'd die for you. Are you sure about that? Yeah. You okay? Hey, hey, hey. Leave me alone! For God's sake. wanted me to be Dr. Webb, it's John Anderson. I'm sorry for the short notice, but is there any chance you could meet with me today? I'm booked today. Will tomorrow work? It's... it's important, and I just need to talk to you for a few minutes. I gotta get this figured out. I'm ready to discuss more... more ways of treatment. What's going on? I'm afraid Ryan put my daughter in some real jeopardy this time. God. What happened? I'm meeting with detectives tonight to figure it out. A female student was attacked at the university pool last week. Cops say they can I.D. my daughter outside the pool at the time of the attack. Dr. Webb? Are you still there? Let's meet at the Crescent Café at 10:00. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. Ryan, Dave's here! Hey. I need to borrow your car Saturday. Done. What's wrong with your truck? It won't start. Zeal, let's go, honey! Morning, Pop! You scared me, baby. You trying to give me a heart attack? You ready for school? Yep. What do you got there? It's my disguise. Your disguise? Can I see it? It's a secret. I can't show you. It's a secret? You're gonna keep a secret from your dad? Ryan said he's teaching me to be his partner in crime. He did? Yeah, I want to talk to you about that on the way to school. Hey, Donna. Hey, hon, you got a second? Yeah, what's up? Look, I'm meeting Susan in a minute to discuss Christine. Is everything okay? Bill, I can't live like this anymore, and I want this resolved tonight. What? Tonight? Honey, I need more time. She's in a really fragile place right now. She knows about us, Bill. I can sense it. No, you're being paranoid. She's just really unstable. She's here. Gotta go. Donna. I really appreciate you coming. Absolutely. It's my pleasure. How are you? I'm good. I really need your help with this. Yeah. I find the whole thing rather intriguing. Well, you're not living it. By the way, how is Bill holding up? He's, um... Well, he's a basket case. Wow. Any news from the doctor? not good news. Looks like it's gonna be just Bill and me. I'm so sorry. So we're gonna get your brother some help. You understand? Okay, Pop. I'll miss him. Don't want to be late. Ms. Airlie will be upset with you? Yep. Did you finish that project? Yep. I finished it. All right. Give me a kiss. Love you. Have a good day. What the hell? Ryan! Hi, Mr. Anderson. I don't know, though. I... I will think about it carefully. So, Christine's case, please, tell me what you think. I'm just too close to it. Well, based on what you've described, I'm thinking D.I.D. Interesting. A severe trauma can trigger the splintering of a single personality into two distinct personalities. You know, often the second one is created 'cause the original can't handle the issues at hand, but it operates as its own entity, you know, with its own agenda. Well, then explain the hallucinations. Cognitive leakage. I mean, any event that threatens to expose the original mind to the alternate mind must be blocked, o the hallucinations re kind of like... psychological rationalizations. I have to think about it. You should trust me on this one. You know, it was less than 100 years ago that people thought the mentally ill were all possessed by spirits of the dead. I have got to get back to the office. Okay. Great to see you. Thank you. Yeah. Bye. John! John! John! Help, please! Help! Next we'll discuss the supernatural symbolism Shakespeare uses in "Macbeth." For example, the witches represent Macbeth's inner evil. The brooding darkness symbolizes the darkness in Macbeth's heart and the evil nature of his horrible deeds. Go ahead, Ryan. What the hell? Susan? Demon! Susan. There's... There's evil in the house. Are you sick? Did you take these? There's a demon in the house. Yeah, yeah. How many of these did you take? Shh. Shh. All right, come on, let's get you out of this... No! No! No! There's evil in this house. I saw it with my own eyes. She drove the big red truck. What truck? John Anderson, she mowed him down. She killed him. I saw it with my own eyes. John Anderson's dead because of her. What are you talking about? All right, come on. No, she's possessed! She's possessed! She's possessed, honey. She's possessed! Hey, do you know where your, dad's at? He was in an accident yesterday. Is he all right? He's dead. My God. What are you talking about, he's dead? Hit-and-run. Where? For God's sake! Does it matter where? I'm really sorry about your dad. I'm Christine, by the way, his fiancée. Yeah. My dad was all excited about you guys getting married. He wanted me to give you this. Thank you. I'm really sorry for your loss. Let's go. Take care. "James, congratulations to you and Christine. "I know we're both a little strapped for cash "until business improves, so I'd be honored "if you would accept my cabin as your honeymoon getaway "and my wedding present to you. Best wishes, John." You've been fucking amazing. Pretty soon, we'll be together. Can't wait. So tell me about our fall guy. I'll take care of Dave Saturday night. What's his motive? obsession. Couldn't deal with your marriage to James. Perfect. Congratulations. Thank you so much. Hey, it's a shame Susan couldn't make it. Is everything okay? Yeah, I guess she came down with stomach flu or something. Take good care of Christine, 'cause if anything happens to her, I'll kill you, and I'll make it look like an accident. You guys have fun at the cabin! Give me a call when you come up for air? I will. Bye, big brother. Bye. So that's over with. Got mixed emotions, but she seems to be happy, nd I guess that's all hat matters, right? Everyone was disappointed that you weren't there. Well, your sister is a very sick girl, Bill. God, please just don't. Just don't. Donna was right. You talked to Donna? She's developed two very distinct personalities. You know, it's interesting. Two sides... Chrissy and Christine. Now, Chrissy is the evil one... and she absorbs all of Christine's pain nd settles all f her grudges for her. That's ridiculous. You know what? I still don't understand why in the world she would ever kill John Anderson. Susie, you really gotta stop taking those pills. I know what I saw, Bill, and Monday morning, I'm going to the police, and I'm going to tell them everything. Yeah, you do that. You're just gonna make a goddamn ass of yourself. We did it. Yeah, we did. Can you believe it? Nope. Why are you so sad? It's nothing. Why are you crying? Just love you so much. Hey, wait. What? I have a surprise for you in my car. Go get it? What is it? It's a surprise. I can't tell you. It's in my trunk. Okay. Go. I love you. I love you. It's the blushing bride. Hey, big brother. Could I ask you a favor? Yeah. What's up? If you can't, I understand. I just... Is there any way you could come scope out the cabin tonight? Tonight? Yeah. Is that too much to ask? Is everything okay? I think so. Maybe I'm just paranoid. I... just feel like someone's following us, and I don't want to bother James. Give me 30 minutes to get up there. Thanks. I owe you big time. Motherf... James. What? James. Zeal, scram. You little bitch. It was you the whole time, wasn 't it? You don't even have the balls to pull that trigger, Ryan. You know that. What do you think, Ryan? Think if you kill me, she's gonna want you? Hink that's hat it's about? You're nothing but a little freak. Christine? It's a terrifying feeling, isn't it? Lying helpless, waiting to die? It's how they felt, James. What are you talking about, baby? My parents, James. Baby, have you gone crazy? Maybe. Look at our sleeping beauty up there. James, be careful, please. Will you relax? When it rains this hard, it usually only lasts a few minutes. How you doing up there, buddy? The highway's flooded. I gotta take this exit. Y the way, I'm sick f your comments about my lack of education in front of our daughter. I don't like your tone. My tone? Yes, your condescending tone. You started it. You sound like a child. Stop treating me like a child. What's going on, buddy? Well, the car stalled. What? - Well, there you go. - Thank God. Hey, watch out! You're in reverse! There's a train! James, what are you doing?! James, there's a train! James! Sorry! James! God. My God. No! No! No! Just take responsibility for what you did, James. Christine, I did it for you. For us. They were never gonna let us be together. You know that. And I thought it was gonna make it easier. I really did. But I was wrong. I wish I could take it back. I'm sorry. Give me the gun. No, Christine, please. You know, it didn't have to be this way. This is your fault, James! Christine, no, please! No, I loved you. I loved you. How could you do this? This is unreal. That wasn't the plan. Your prints are all over the gun. Just shut up, Ryan! Fuck. Okay. Okay. Holy shit, Ryan! Is that a cop? Shit. They must have heard the shot. Get him in the car. Shit. Now what? Now what? Th-They're gonna call his radio. There's gonna be no response. Then they come looking for him. Listen to me. Just calm down, all right? F we get... ust calm down. It's gonna be, okay. Just trust me. Trust me, Ryan, okay? Just get rid of the girl, and wipe down the gun. Okay, trust me. Shit. Hey. Bill. Bill, he's here. What? He's... He's in the house. You have to hurry. He's gonna kill me. Stay on the phone with me. Tell me exactly what's going on. I'm almost there! He shot James. James is dead. Who shot him? Ryan. Ryan Anderson. Bill, please hurry. He's gonna find me. Where is he? Are you in the house? Yes, I'm locked in the bedroom. Hurry. Okay, I'm five minutes away. Just don't... Chr-Chri... 131. 131. Go ahead, 131. Code three, 1822 Roaming Wood Road, Cottage Grove. Send every car in the area. Roger, 131. En route. I gotta get Dave's car back to town. Wow. How are you gonna get rid of him? I... I'll do him with the shotgun, and I'll... I'll dump a bunch of your stuff around his trailer, make him look like the classic stalker. There's tire tracks all over this place. And what about our other loose end? Don't worry about a thing. She's... She's taken care of. Perfect. Yeah. Take this off. Come here. Choke me. What? Don't stop. Choke me. You're k-kidding. No! Hey! You're a fucking dead man! No! Listen to me. I need you to tell me what's going on. Susan says that you've killed someone, that she can place you at the scene of a homicide. Now if you need help, I can help you, but you've gotta be honest with me. He police are gonna e here any second. You're in a lot of trouble, Bill. Miss Webb, what was the nature of your relationship with the two victims? Miss Webb? So do you know this Ryan Anderson? What? Did you know Ryan Anderson? No. I think he worked at the sawmill with James. We found this in the front seat of one of the cars. Do you recognize this weapon, Mr. Webb? Might be mine. It might be yours? How did it get here? I don't know. We got two dead bodies, one young man in his early twenties, one in his fifties, a Sheriff both shot execution style. Shotgun wounds? Definitely. Do you know anything about thes e bodies, Mr. Webb? I want an attorney. And what about our other loose end? Don't worry about a thing. She's... She's taken care of. Susan says that you've killed someone, that she can place you at the scene of a homicide. We're almost done, sweetheart. Just one more little thing. Hi. Hi, Mommy. Thank you, Mr. Blooms! Take care, Susan. Thank you. Bye. I missed you so much! O what did ou learn today? I learned how to play "Mary Had A Little Lamb." No way. Yes. 'Cause you are my little lamb. You can't catch me! Yes, you are! Yes, you're my little... By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes.
