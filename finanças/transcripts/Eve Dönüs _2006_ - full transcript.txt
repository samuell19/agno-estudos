If we can find a fountain, we can add water to the mix. Don't look at me, it is no use! I won't tell. So you won't help the revolutionists? Is it a good deed that the revolutionists seize the gun of a laborer like Give my gun back, I will show you the nearest fountain. OK, Mr. Guard. Done!

So that you follow up all this business? Also whenever we come to a union meeting, something violent bursts out. Look guys; you're really good. If only you took the union more You'd really be cool. Also you have to fight for your rights; economical... Democratical, political. The struggle of the working class... Forget it brother. My wife has abandoned me. My team lost on sunday... I lost the horse race bets. I don't have any luck with any games. And you're nagging us with all this blahblah of economy, democracy. Well, it's my fault to talk to a lumpen like you. Because of people like you labor class can't raise its head from the pit What class are you talking about? Are we at school here? Because of representatives like you the laborers can't raise their nose Get out of here! You know what I want? An uninterrupted sleep for 3 days and nights. I know what you really want, Mistik. How long has it been since you last did it with your wife? Don't remind me that. It's more than a month now. But once the debt of the television is over... We stop working overtime then you'll see your brother Mistik... So you can't ride your wife because of the television, then why not ride More colorful. Don't make me ride you while you are by my side? Folks! Friends! Our union secretary, H?seyin Uysal, shot by fascists three days ago in Could not survive and died two hours ago... I invite you to one-minute silence for this courageous leader of Those of us who died, died fighting and are buried in the sun... There's no time to mourn for them. There's a raid, a raid to the sun. We'll conquer the sun, soon will be the conquest of the sun. Let his life set an example to us. Let his memory enlighten our path. Friends! The terror and the fascist murders... Supported by the state cannot intimidate us. Down with fascism, down with fascism. Cahit, come here. Sorry. What's up, boy? You are stuck frozen. Nothing. I was running after Cahit. So you have run out of women and started chasing each other? So what? Women keep making excuses. They make us beg. What? They play coquettish to a handsome like you? You haven't met your woman. It seems that you've been knocking on the Anyway, handsome, you don't need to be satisfied with the looks only. Come to me one day for the real experience. OK. Wake me up as soon as you come. I'll go and see the child. I'm fed up with this in-house correspondence. Esma... Esma... Wake up, woman. OK. OK. I woke up. I'll be late for the shuttle.

We can't even look after one child... Wait for Friday when our shifts coincide. - Yes? - Yes? What yes? For god's sake, what kind of people are you? Get out of my house. I've been waiting for a year. How shameless you are! - Where will we go? - Where! How should I know? Go wherever you go. It is me to find a place for you to move? Look, old chap, we have installments to pay. Go and make your complaint to where you want. We can't go anywhere. Now you'll really freak me out. - May God damn you all. - Uncle Mahmut, don't curse. We'll fall out in the end. Let all the curse of God be on you. My dear, such a sweet girl she is, and well behaved. My daughter. Look, don't be naughty. - Don't upset grandma, OK? - OK. - My dear. - Mom, I'm late. - Why are you in such a hurry? - I've got to catch the shuttle. Honey, how long will this rush go on? Look, you've lost weight. Once the installments of the television are settled we'll be relieved. Then we'll not work overtime anymore. Then there will be other installments. My dear, you were really stubborn to marry that boy. - Mother, not again. - Mother. Mother. So what? That horse-faced Muhsin, you belittled has already become a captain in I wouldn't care if he were a major. I love my husband. She loves her husband! I love you too. And I love you, too, my daughter. Ok, have a good day. Hello, father... See you. See the daughter of the respectable Korean Veteran Sacid... What a pity. Take! Wake up man. Open the sack. You're all done gentlemen. How come man? Are you tricking us? Don't call it tricking man. He's apparently cheating. Get out of here! We have been captives for two days now. From work, to caf?, caf? to work. Make money at the factory, lose it to Cahit in the game... I'm not in. This is my last turn. I'll die of sleeplessness. What do you mean I'm not in. I'm at loss, brother. Muhlis, your peers have become pilgrims in Mecca. They throw stones at the Satan, while you play with stones here. How Mind your own business, you bastard. And you, stop. But, Muhlis, I'm losing, too. In the last ten turns, I did nothing. You lose in gambling but win in love. Everybody knows about you and Come on, brother. I have nothing to do with womanizing. No way, for a man like me. Easy, easy, don't be afraid. Just a blow of exhaust. The game cannot be disrupted. Come on, lay the tiles. I quit. I'm dying of lack of sleep. What do you mean? I have two jokers, you'll play. Your previous wins will count for that! Let's go, have some sleep and regain our strength. Don't be a jerk. We'll also be going soon. Sit down, the last turn. OK. Come on. The last one. Four, five, six. Esma this is the last installment of the television. Be careful my daughter. Don't play with it. It's a very expensive toy. It's a very expensive toy. Take care. It gave us a hard time. - Mom. - My girl, my dear girl. Look what your mother has made for you. It burns my mouth. I'll now scold you mother. Esma, girl, wish you had fried some rolls. If the weather is good tomorrow, we'll enjoy the day. - We'll take the rakis. - You only think of eating and drinking. Remember? You held my hand for the first time in that park. Now, you remember raki when you think of G?lhane. Am I in a state to hold a hand? Go to your bed, dear. Sorrow of sustention, election strained me. Then it was like that, now Those days, I was young and I could held the hands of girls. Now, I grew old and I hold the raki bottle Esma. I'm going to drink a lot tomorrow. Let me tell you this very moment then you don't make any fuss. Drink. Then tease everyone and get a good beat. Don't get on my nerves at this time of the night! No man who will beat me has yet been born. I don't care a bit if the boxer Cemal Kamaci came. Listen... Let's buy a washing machine after settling the payment for TV. No. There'll be no installments for a while. Let's go to bed my girl. - Good night, sweetie. - Good night, daddy. Come on girl, come on. Stop, man. You'll kill me. It's you who kills me for such a long time. Hush, the child. The light. The door. Close the door. - You stink of cigarettes. - And you stink of onions. Do I complain? Besides, it's better like this. Full of odor. Pull out. Pull out! Oh my God! What if I get pregnant? No problem. If you get pregnant, you get an abortion. Am I not of flesh and blood? It's a big sin. - Besides, it's very expensive. - Don't worry woman. We can work overtime for this, too. You're a maniac. My beautiful girl! Come on, let's go. Esma. Come on, dress our girl then we'll go. Come on my girl, play with your dolls, we'll soon be going. - Come here. - Have you lost your mind? It's morning. It's better in the morning time. Come on, to the room. The child? Also, we did it last night? Sure, but we hadn't had for a month. My girl... Come to mummy. Come on. Where do you find such songs in the morning? Find something to wake us up. Mustafa, find another song. Are you doing it deliberately? It's not me; it's the man on the radio! Every channel I switch to he - You liked that man. - The man is stuck! When are we to meet your folks? At 10:00, at the upper gate of Gulhane Park. Then go and buy some bread. Come on. - Stop, it is prohibited. - Why's that? Go home. No questions. There's a batting order. I can shoot you. Why, what's up? Don't you ever watch TV? There is military coup. Don't stand there. Go home. Go! Where's the bread? Have you forgotten to take money? - We'll forget G?lhane. - Why? - Look here. Watch and see... - "I must state once more that..." "The Army has had to usurp the government for the purpose..." "...of restoring the welfare and happiness..." - What's going on Mustafa? - Military takeover, fool, coup. We're banned to go out. - You mean we can't go now? - Everything is messed up... And you're talking about going. "...settling the democracy which cannot control itself..." "...on rigid fundaments and reestablishing..." "...the lost authority of the state..." If you're making a military coup, why not do it on a work day... So that we could have a day off. Now you wasted our holiday. "...to sacrifice everything, even our lives, for the sake of the "...and happiness of the nation." Mustafa, I wonder if the housing rents increase now. "Many of those ill-willed people and institutions..." "...grown in number lately, may tell you lies..." "...claim the otherwise and resort to negative propagandas." "Never believe these people." "All steps from here onwards, shall be made..." "...before the very eyes of the nation." "Dear citizens, any resistance, demonstrations and..." "...attributes against the Turkish Army..." "...which have always been integrated with and under..." "...the service of its nation and the new government..." "...will be immediately broken and punished..." "...in the heaviest possible way." "So that no blood is shed in the country..." "I request that all my citizens act in accordance with..." "...the declarations to be issued in the country in peace..." "...without giving in to provocations and..." "...not go out until a second declaration." "Dear citizens. I didn't come here to address you." "That was not my intention." - Come on. - "But, as I stated at the beginning..." "I couldn't help myself addressing you with a few words when I saw this." Today they took G?ler in as well. She shouldn't have been involved in this business. - "We have a lot to do." - Union or something... Are these issues that a woman should be involved in? Is it her business being a workplace representative? Are there any men in our section apart from the managers? If she weren't the representative, another girl would... Besides, she quit the representative job long ago. Then she had another involvement. Why would they take her if she did not have a connection? Why don't they take you, or me? God, who's that at this time? - Who's it? - Me. Is there no other day? You're pounding at my door at this time of the night. In the day time, neither of you are home. When shall I come if not now? You have one week. Get out of my house. I won't. Let alone one week, I won't get out even after a hundred weeks. Understand? Are you suing us? Do whatever you do. Look, son, you're at my son's age. - Don't make me lose my patience. - Do whatever you do. I don't care. - So you're not getting out? - I'm not getting out of your house. Go and make a complaint of me wherever you want. - Bastard! - Let's find a place and get out. OK, let's get out; but where? Do you have any idea about the rents? We can't even rent a room with the rent we pay for this house. Simply, it's so difficult. "Second Declaration of National Security Council" "One: Army Commander Necdet Urug is the chief of Martial Law in Istanbul. No jokes must be made with the army! You should stop and think when the subject is the Turkish army. They won't let two rootless politicians... Make the children of this country murder each other. These politicians gave way to the communists. They allowed registered communists to lecture at universities. We, the army, went as far as Korea to obliterate these communists. We shot and we were shot. Certainly, father. You shot and got shot. But I didn't get shot, and shoot either. When it is time, you'll shoot and got shot, son. Moreover, it's not right to leave those politicians to their devices. Once in ten or fifteen years, you must show your fist and say the army is Come on, son, we won't have left things unfinished. The country has been Now, let us save our stomachs. Drink a little, you can't bear it, drink little. Look, son, there was a commander in Korea with us. Tahsin Yazici. He was such an able man. If you're going to begin your Korea memories again, I'm going to bed. - OK, OK. - It's time to go, mother. - Stay here. - We returned to 06:00-14:00 shift. We can't wake up in the morning. Come on, Mustafa, take the girl. Ok, let's go. Look, father, don't think I'm a good-for nothing. When necessary, if need be I can die and kill for this country. - I don't doubt it, son. - I swear father. Come on, the curfew is about to begin. If need be, we'll stay for the curfew. - Ok, Ok come on, take the child. - Ok. We'll go out in the curfew time. Just because of your foolish pride. There's supposed to be no bus or something at this time. - We could have stayed at your mother's. - You'd have drunk less and got We'd have arrived home long ago. Let's take that taxi at least. Taxi! Mustafa. Hey, Mustafa. The door. - What door? - Mustafa. I'll screw this damn landlord. My Lord! Don't move. Raise your hands. Open your legs. Turn back. - Mustafa! - You, come here. - There must be a mistake, officer. - What mistake? Aren't you Mustafa Alakurt, born in 1951, in Emirdag? Yes. - Are you married? - Of course we are! - Is it revolution marriage? - No, sir, civil marriage. - I found these, constable. - Sex magazines? - And I found these, constable. - Take them to the car. Be careful! Are you the one to teach us what we are to care jerk? Please don't do, whatever you do. Please don't. Now, Mustafa Alakurt, we're going. Where? No. No, my husband. Mustafa! From 5459 to the center. From 5459 to the center. Sehmuz operation completed without incidents. OK. - "Home Delivery at once. OK." - Understood. OK. Brother... Mustafa! Who are you to in the middle of the night? Shut up! Cover this bastard's eyes. - Come back, come. - Brother, you're making a mistake. Shut up, don't lie in mud when you have your tail caught up. Be a little brave. Welcome Sehmuz. Frisk him. Is it your wife? Good. If you speak like a decent fellow, we won't have to bring her - He doesn't use a phonebook, the canny. - He must've memorized necessary What do you think Sehmuz? Sehmuz, honey, I'm telling you. Sehmuz? What Sehmuz? Don't keep me here. There must be a mistake. I have nothing to do with these things. I'm an ordinary worker. 'Course you're a worker. You can't be both fabricator and anarchist, can How do you call it, proletarian revolutionist, isn't it? Take him. - There must be a mis... - Walk. You hear Sehmuz? Here, they break one's back but they make him speak at Here you see. So, decently give the address of that organization... Appointments and the names of the Grandfather and... The Brother-in-law then we'll decently forward you... To the public prosecution office. - What do you say, ?ehmuz? - I swear I'm not ?ehmuz; I'm Mustafa. I swear to God! My name is Mustafa. I don't know a Grandfather, nor someone else. I do not have sister... How can I have a brother-in-law? This man's not going to correct his ways by friendly means. Dress him. Not the things in your stomach, you'll vomit the things in your mind, Speak! Look, Brother ?ehmuz. Two of your team spoke. And one is about to speak. Don't have yourself roughed up in vain. Come on, speak. Speak buddy! Look, ?ehmuz, we have a lot of work to do. Calm down a little. Then we'll talk, OK? Take him. I'm Sacid, the Korea veteran. I can't look for a terrorist son-in-law in police stations. - I can't do this. - Don't get nervous! - You'll have a heart attack again. - Father, please. I went as far to Korea to shoot communists. I can't do it. I can't look for a communist son-in-law in police stations. Do you understand? I know my four-year husband well. He's got nothing to do with such You don't know these men, my girl. These communists like working secretly They establish a cell in your house and by God, you don't know about it. It's all made up. Mustafa has nothing to with that kind of business. I understood that he was a communist the first time I saw him. It's not possible. He was mad at these affairs. He wouldn't be involved. Even to the union, he subscribed to the union involuntarily. He's not a criminal. Get up, this is not a hotel. Professor, did you recognize ?ehmuz? - No, I didn't. - Look ahead. - I see this guy for the first time. - Really? So, you don't know him. What about you, ?ehmuz, do you know the Professor? Good. You'll meet soon. Blindfold his eyes. Take them. Take the professor first. You'll make yourself strangled buddy. Speak! Let the electricity. Professor, tell us this man is ?ehmuz. Why are you hiding it? He admitted himself, then why are you hiding it? Speak, or I'll turn you into coal. - Any news from Mustafa? - No. The Police came again yesterday when I wasn't home. They left the place a I wonder what they were to find. It offends me so. I wouldn't be so upset if my poor man had any relation with such affairs. I'd say, he involved in these affairs and we're taking the consequences. But believe me he has nothing to do with them. - What are you doing? - Have you lost your mind? - What are you doing? - Evacuating the house. Three times a day my house is raided by the police. You made my house the home of anarchists. Heartless man! You ruined my home! Who are you sending away? I'll go get the police. Go and say hello for me. You turned my house into a home of anarchists. I got dressed down because of you. They almost pulled me in. Come on. You're not only guilty but offensive as well about it. You made my house a home of terrorists. A home of terrorists. You evacuated the house, so why are you still yelling. Shame on you. Call your mother. Stay with them for a while. Until you learn where Mustafa is. ?rnektepe public committee officer ?ehmuz, tell us. ?ehmuz. Speak. I'm not ?ehmuz. I swear I'm not. Mercy, officer. Tell the truth instead of begging for mercy, come on. OK. Enough. Where did you hide the guns with which you attacked... ...the police car in Gayrettepe? Your appointments! Come on, speak! Who's the Grandfather? The brother-in-law? God's my witness I don't know. I swear I don't know. I beg you. Then we'll go to the beginning. Go on. Brother, don't hit for god's sake. I'm ?ehmuz. I'm ?ehmuz. - The communist came around. - Come, come, who are you? ?ehmuz. Yes, my code name is ?ehmuz. Your code name is ?ehmuz. Raise him. Walk him. Walk, ?ehmuz, walk, or your feet become huge and you get hurt. Take a step! Seat him. Seat him. Now, tell like a decent fellow. Who do you know? - I know the Professor. - Else? And I know the Grandfather and the Brother-in-law. - Well done, amend your ways. - A cigarette, a cigarette, please. Yes, this amusement is enough. Tell me. Where did you hide the guns? The guns that we used... The guns with which you attacked a police car in Gayrettepe, killed our I threw them into the sea. From Ortak?y. Did nobody see that huge Kalashnikov? - I mean, "Celesh", as you say. - I threw it in the midnight. Nobody saw. Are you sure, the gun you threw into the sea was Kalashnikov? Yes. "Kalashkov" I mean, Celesh. This man is a teaser. This man is a bastard. Are you passing to us what you learnt from us, jerk? You think you're going to fool us this easily? Weren't the guns you used 14 mm? You, son of a bitch! By the Koran, brother, I'm not ?ehmuz, I'm Mustafa. Bastard! Look. Hang this man on the hangers and give electricity to his dick. He'll pay for this. Son of a bitch. Don't get so tense. Relax. Otherwise, it will hurt more. You're better now aren't you? Are you that guy, the Professor that they showed to me? Yes. - My real name is Nurettin. - I have only one name. Mustafa. My name is not ?ehmuz. My name is Mustafa. My name is Mustafa. - I know you're not ?ehmuz. - I swear I'm not. Cry out. Do what makes you stand. But never accept the accusations. How can I not accept accusations. They gave me electricity all around. They gave electricity even to my thing. Brother, has my manhood gone? Calm down, calm down, nothing will happen, calm down. You're sure, aren't you brother, that no harm will come to my virility? Try to stand by any means, but never accept the accusations. How can I possibly accept, brother? I tried to make it up... Brother I have neither an organization house... Nor do I know about anything about appointments. I don't know anything. I have nothing to do with such affairs. Brother, I'm a plain citizen. And I'm a primary school teacher; but both of us are dangerous for them. Very dangerous. How can I be dangerous? I have nothing to do with neither the right nor the left. I'm an ordinary laborer. My mind doesn't work for such affairs. If the minds of you and people like you worked for such affairs... Neither of us would be here now. Come in. They didn't show any grounds; they just paid me... ...For the days I worked and they sacked me. And no indemnities. It's because of the bastard who is you husband. Is there any news? Today, I searched in two more police stations. He's not there. But one police said... "They must have taken him to the political branch." I'll try there, too. You go about your business, I'll go to the political branch tomorrow. Maybe I'll find him there. - Father, the house. - What about the house? I've been staying with my neighbors for four days. The landlord kicked us You mean you are homeless for 4 days. What about Elif? What a pity! We had anyway decided to move. But now that I'm fired. Wait a minute. I'll take care of the customers. Then we'll find a ?ehmuz. Let's not quarrel today, OK? Let's not upset each other. Let's speak like brothers. We are both tired. Now, tell me, who's the Grandfather? Who is the Brother-in-Law? Where's your organization house? Come on. Officer, I don't know any of these persons. For God's sake I don't know. - Look, please, don't hit me. - ?ehmuz, do you want some cigarettes? Give him a cigarette, unfold his eyes. You, look at the ground, don't make me blind your eyes. Are you going to speak? ?ehmuz? I don't know. Please, I don't know. Aren't you going to tell? Who's the Grandfather? The Brother-in-law? Your organizational house? - Has something happened, daughter? - I think the Angel of Death grabbled God forbid! - Are you looking for your husband? - Yes. They haven't told anything for two days. But, they said he was here a Meeting's forbidden. You write the names of your acquaintances and your ...And I'll let you know if he's around here. Untie him. Come, come, come, give me a pencil. Come here. Write: I got the money. - Money? What money? - Write. My dear wife, I got the money. I'm well, don't worry. See you soon. Good, now, sign that. Yes. Talks are over. Now, let's go about our business. Tell me, who's the Grandfather, the Brother-in-law? Come tell, me, come on! Where did you hide the gun? Come on. Look, tell me what you want me to say, whatever you want, and I'll sign I accept everything. Look at him, are you teaching us our business? Are we not sons of god? Are we crooked? Are we making people sign false statements here? You ignoble! You'll vomit! You'll vomit and we'll write, and you'll sign. You mother fucker. Aydin Ozan. Mustafa Alakurt. - Brother, when will he be released? - Don't know. Depends on his crime. "They can assert that the detainees are tortured." "We, dear citizens are against torture." "We do not want to come to a conclusion by torture." "This is contradictory to human rights. Contradictory to conscience." You see? What they told you in front of the branch is not true. Torture or something. Can the esteemed pasha lie? You hear, there's no torture. Look, father, look carefully. I recognize my husband's handwriting. This is his handwriting; but it seems as if it weren't. As if he couldn't even grab the pencil. As if his hand shook. As if... - God damn it! Bastards! - What's up? Our team lost to Fener. That's because I couldn't go. All's because of the inaptitude of the trainer Spaji?. - Are you a Besiktas fan? - Yes I'm and I'm proud of it. I was prepared for this game so well. But, they took me here. What team do you favor? Stop. Don't tell. I'll guess. You are a Galatasaray fan. Why on earth did you think of that? Don't know, those well-educated ones always be Galatasaray fans. - Or, are you a Fener fan? - No, I'm not. - Or, you are... - I'm a Besiktas fan, too. Moreover, I'm the regular of Gazhane side back-goal. So, we lost to Fener? So, you are really one of us. I'm lucky. What if you were a Fener fan? We would quarrel day and night. Good that we won't quarrel. I hope we will get out of here someday and go to a match together... And we have raki after that. Raki with plenty of ice, a little water. No water. You must drink the raki dry, so that you can relish it. You can't be involved with the forbidden and the prohibited. You're a kindred spirit, Professor. We met in the wrong place. In fact, I don't like adding water to raki; but... Why do you look upset? Is it Fener's defeat? No, professor, it is Elif. Your sweetheart? My daughter. She's four years old. - God bless her to you. - Thank you. You have any kids? - No, I'm not married. - Did you get a divorce? No, I never got married. I had no time. Wish this son of a bitch spoke and it's finished. Today's my daughter's Chief. Either this man is not Sehmuz or he's very well trained. I think we are dealing with the wrong man. He is really naive. I say brother-in-law he says he doesn't have a sister. Were we not informed that this man is the officer of Ornektepe Public Doesn't he suit to the description sent by the intelligence office? - Yes, he does. - Then what can I do? Should I release that son of a bitch because he acts well? Go, work. Make him speak. Investigate if there is a photo of that Sehmuz. Look at me. How's Niyazi? He's likely to speak. He talked in his sleep in bits. Then lay on him. When he speaks, confront him with Sehmuz. I am going. Communicate me on wireless if something important happens. Look carefully, is this the man you delivered the guns? Why are you staring like that? Are you going to draw his picture? Is it Sehmuz or not? That's Sehmuz we delivered the guns. Brother, please, don't, please. Who else were involved in Gayrettepe incident? Do not play the hero man. Answer, I say, who else were involved. You already talked. It doesn't make any difference whether you gave name of three or ten Who else were involved? - The tourist. - Our tourist? - Yeah. - Isn't he in prison? He says tourist.

Does she still bother your mother? I'm looking after her now. They fired me. They didn't tell the reason. They didn't give severance pay, either. Civil police came and asked for me. And they... Anyway, you must be tired. We'll talk about these, tomorrow. - I say it was a mistake. - Look, you know how much I like you. But there's nothing I can do. The order is so. Those who involved in anarchy, get arrested... But, sir, you know I have nothing to do with anarchy. - This is against labor law. - What can you call lawful these days?

They followed me when I went to the address the Professor told. - Did you go there? - I went. I did but I couldn't knock on the door. I was afraid. What if it is a house of the organization?
