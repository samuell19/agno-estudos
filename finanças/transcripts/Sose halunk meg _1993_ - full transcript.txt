Do you know who this is? Guess who?... Balogh Koki! Koki!... Soccer player from the National Team. Just once. Against the Ruskies. Once? If you'd kicked in the goal, you'd be Puskas today! - But is didn't. - So what? You're still Balogh Koki. So, who are you? Who am I? He doesn't remember... He's loaded. Listen, Koki!

He's gonna be an actor! - Congratulations! - The experts said so. - Why don't you recite something? - But uncle Juicy... They say he'll be a great one! He recites poetry beautifully. - Let's hear it! - Endre Ady... Wait... could you stop that typing? Come here! You want to be seen by everyone! An actor should always know where to stand. Good afternoon, comrade Chabay! Wait!... Comrade Torok, can I unload here? Okay, out with it, Sonny! Wanna bet he'll recite Ady? That's his best. Ady is. - Endre Ady... - I told you! - "The Old Jester" - That's it. "In magenta mantle he came from the Orient at the pristine dawn of rhymes. Singing drunkard on a steamy stallion, playing music on his instrument. The old, jeering jester arrived and set next to me..." Comrade Torok, could you get me that country report? - It came on the 6th or the 7th. - Come on, Sonny, do it! "Rowdy fellow... singing into my ear... we are guzzling away our..." "and I am listening to him... rosy dawns swish by it droves and knock on my windows. The lost happiness of the sacred Orient, - became our miserable present" - Magdy, your skirt hangers! Come on everybody, if you want to buy something! - Very good, young man... - Bravo! Bravissimo, Sonny! - I know that poem. - Sure you do. So many well-versed people in one office... - Why'd I have to recite there? - An actor's always an actor. It was beautiful... and we sold 20 hangers. - What are you staring at? - I'm not staring. Go ahead and stare! This is a free country! - Shut up! - Why? Aren't we free? We can stare at whatever we want to! Wait till I come out! I'll make you stare at something! Yapping! Still yapping! I'll give you freedom, you dirty fascists! - Are we ever going to lrma's? - Relax, I want to collect here. Good afternoon! Here comes the vendor, Juicy... You should give him a little kissy... Hey! - I'll steal the store! - Why yell when no one's here? So someone would come out. First, let me congratulate you on your new shop! It's just opened. Brand new! Well, where there's a need, there's aid. Such pretty sweaters call for strong hangers. Good hangers, strong hangers! Just name the price! You tell me what you want to pay for them! Julius! Don't you recognise me? Of course, ma'am... I mean, wait... Let me introduce lmi to you... - lmre Tordai. - He's 17. Your son? Looks a lot like you. She's Aunt Theresa... Stop gaping! She won the beauty pageant. You're so beautiful... You're still beautiful, Terry. I swear to God... your mouth... Your mouth is like a rose. - You're really beautiful. - Yeah... You said you'd buy two rings in Budapest. They didn't have any. Not the right kind, anyway. And... I sent messages to you... that I love you and... you can come back... but you didn't. I was coming... but I didn't because of the war... I was drafted... it wasn't that bad... stationed near Rostov. Then... How about you? Kids? Well... cheer up! We've got to leave. Have an appointment at the barber. Good bye! I'll stop by tomorrow, okay? Or tonight... After I put him to bed... See you Theresa! I forgot the hangers! See you! She was the prettiest girl here. And what a fine, classy woman! Her father owned the water mill. Wow, man! She would've followed me to the end of the world. - Followed you? - Mrs. Pankotai! - You knew Theresa Body! - Everyone knew her. A whore! - Terry? - A classy whore, but a whore! Don't gossip, granny! Let's go! Miss Theresa was the most beautiful woman in Ujhely. - Because all women are pretty. - That's right! What's up, Balthazar? How goes the Dostoevsky? Tell your nephew not to look at my wife like that! Why? How's he looking? - You know very well. - Why do you drag her with you? That's none of your business! Clear? Clear as mud. If you've got sausage in your bag, dogs are bound to chase you. Do you know what I'd do with those dogs? Do you know? - Come on, Balthazar! - What would he do? - Guess where we' re going! - To Irma? Great kid, huh? Moustache stays? His nose is full of studs! Wipe it off... He wants to be an actor. He recites poems beautifully. He's temperamental like me! Doesn't come up for air till the fifth round. Really... Right, Sonny Boy? - Nice kid, right, Eva? - Kid? His a man! A man! - Be careful! Don't cut him! - Trust me Juicy! I trust you so much that Eva and I are going for an ice cream. Do you like ice cream? Great! Let's go! Juicy! You come once a year, and you want to leave me now? Finish the kid! - Did you cheat on me a lot? - Me, Boobsy Baby? Never! - Call me Boobsy Baby again! - Boobsy Baby... - Where' re you going, Boobsy Baby? - I'll show you my new furniture. Sonny, I'll just check out Aunt lrma's set, okay? Eva, finish the kid, will you? - Juicy, come on! - I'm coming! Well then... just wait... I'll fix it for you. Lean back... It's not wet anymore... I'm sorry... I guess the moustache stays... - What's wrong? - Nothing. Call it!... Call On it! Don't worry, I played in the best casinos in Vienna. - Okay... bring the luck! - Tough luck! One in a thousand. Excuse me, is this seat free? May I ask where you're going?... By any chance to Budapest? I've got a good friend there, named Julius Tordai, know him? He's a coat hanger salesman... The best in the country. Still doesn't ring a bell? If it doesn't, it doesn't. You don't buy form him, either? Now that's a mistake. It wasn't too nice to leave me there like that! Did you get lucky? - No. - Too bad. She's quite a girl. She's bow-legged. Well, if that's all you're interested in... - I'm going home. - What? - I'm going home. - No, you're not. I'm your uncle! - I'm responsible for you! - Give me my money! - What money? - That Dad gave you! What you gambled away! Gladly... Here you go! Come on... take it! I bring you along... we had great adventures! You got to know a soccer player! And what about the fair? It bugs you that you didn't get lucky with Eva. What can I do? You can never figure women out. But I'll keep my word!... What did I promise? Grub, booze and women. Grub we had... booze we had... Well, kid, it's no big deal. Don't blow it out of proportion! Look... We'll go somewhere and you can eat as many cakes as you want. Tomorrow's Friday... we'll do some partying... Rock'n Roll - I can't dance. - So what? We'll go to Uncle Deutsch, you'll learn in an hour. Waltz, tango, rumba, whatever... Excuse me, may I? How about a birthday surprise? - Ever sat in one of these? - No, never. - Then today's the day! Good day! - Good day, sir! To the Waltz Café, please! Show me another kid who's ever travelled like this. Betty Lou! Sweety pie! Come and cruise with us! You can even bring that dope along! - Nice horse. What's it called? - Cha-cha-cha. Why not race him at the tracks? You'd be Rockefeller! - I gotta work, not play. - I see, he can't run. This horse?... Hang on then! Hang on, Sonny! Giddy up! Look at him! Got a big whistle! - He's coming after us! - 20 if you lose him! 30... - He's on us! -40! Faster! Faster! That's for you copper! You're nowhere! - We won!... We won! - Okay, let's get those cakes! - Enjoy! - Thank you. Cool, huh? Did you see him on the horse? A monkey on an organ grinder. I once took three day old custard cakes to your mother. - Did she like them? - Well, she ate them... After that... I don't know... "The moon quivers on the lake, silver coloured flames..." Hey, Sonny! You conked out after the sixth one? What you eat is yours! Can't you see he's had enough? - Wanna bet he'll eat them all? - No. He'll lose. Look at him! Leave my nephew to me, okay? Here's my 100. - If he's got that much... - All right, honey. Here you go! Did you hear? I bet 100 that you'll eat them all. Delicious... the best custard cake in the country. Drink! - Can he drink? - Yes. We won't torture him. Here comes the 7th! Here comes the 7th! Take it apart... Delicious... very good... Don't just chew! Swallow! Breathe through your nose! Where seven fit, there's room for an eighth one! Then we'll go to a classy hotel and have a good rest. - Can't... - Of course you can... We should have set a time limit! We can't sit here all night! He's afraid he's gonna lose! Look at your nephew! He's gonna shit his pants any second. Hear that, Sonny Boy? OOps! Sonny Boy, the world's watching you! Have a sip of water! Have a sip! Bravo! He's my nephew! Look at him! A real Tordai! We might be sinners... but we are the winners! That's what it's all about, Sonny Boy! Okay, who wants to bet?

Go on! I'll take them! Hangers... hangers... Strong as life... Hang yourself if you've got a wife. - I don't want any just now. - Strong ones from the capital! Try to break them! Unbreakable hangers. Hey, Sonny Boy, what are you doing? Are your crazy? Get out of here! Have a happy marriage! - I'm going in here, okay? - No, you're not. - He'll chop your head off! - Hold this! I'm going in. No way... What are your doing? This isn't the beach. Uncle Juicy! My clothes, please! Look at him... He leaves his shoes. Watch it, your son-of-a-gun! Kneel next to her. She'll be happy to see you. Sure as death... Sigh, Cleaning Lady, Pharos. Sigh? - Chocho's tip. - I sighed enough in Budapest. You told me to tell you a sure tip. This one's sure. We'll go splitters... then we're even. 2-9-11. Don't bet on anything else for God's sake! - Are your crazy? - No. You are. Somebody burps up a new tip, you gobble it up. I want to take my nephew to the dance. Got a nice suit in the charity box? You know where to find it. But bring it back! No need to tell me. Thanks! Come here your slut! I'll beat you up in this holy place! C'mon!... Don't yank your arm! Fly buttoned up, Sonny Boy? Always keep an eye on it! So, how do you like the place? Great music! Balthazar! "Torn to bloody shreds, violently ripped away from the sky..." - Excuse me! Got any Lenin left? - Get lost! Balthazar! Best books for the best price. Betty Lou... the fire was so dense, bullets hit bullets..." lmi! Sonny Boy! Excuse me! Uncle Juicy! Sigh hasn't won a race in two years. He will now. Hold this for a second! Come on, come on... Come on, Sonny Boy! Great... everything's taken care of... Relax! No need to hurry. Take your time! Betty Lou's not a custard cake to be gobbled up. It's all right... Don't be ashamed to undress if it comes to that. I've settled everything with the janitor. Gently, Sonny Boy...! "Always waiting, but what for..." What's up, Balthazar? - Where is she? - Dancing. Isn't she allowed? Relax a bit! Have some fun! The bitter cold, mocking wind..." Juicy! Enjoy yourself, Balthazar! - Where's your nephew? - He's dancing too. Excuse me! Lady's choice! "The moon throws silver flames on the water... Alone..." Come on! Come and dance! Uncle Juicy! - Stay with him! I'm afraid... - Excuse me... - Who's the kid? - He came in with the patient. - Are you his son? - Yes. Your father's condition is very serious. He won't die, will he? We'll do our best. You can talk to him now. He's conscious. But don't tire him! Uncle Juicy... Go to the priest... You know... next to the church. The nuns... Should I give them something? Just some hangers... but not too many. Not only the spirit... the body must be strong too. Do you do sports? - I sometimes play soccer. - So did I. I was midfield payer at the academy. We always beat the shit out of rabbi students. Excuse me. Let's say a prayer for Juicy! Do your know any of your prayers? Then repeat it: Baruch ata adonai. Elohanu melech Haolam. Rofa holim. - Wake up! - You'll kill yourself! Not on a race day, Sonny! Wake up! Uncle Juicy! Juicy!... Juicy! 2-9-11. Sigh, Cleaning Lady, Pharos. I promised, didn't I? Thanks for everything!

Third one... 2-9-11. - I can't! - Please! - "Post in one minute." - Hear that? - They are starting! - I'm not leaving you! Excuse me... Open up! 2-9-11, please! "Attention! One, two, start!" Got it, Uncle Juicy! Juicy, dear... you scared me to death. Come on! Run! Run! Come on, Sigh! We won! Uncle Juicy, we won! An immense journey ls our life or so you said, and we never die I know we can't go wrong with that old fever that heavenly old fever that I got from you nearly killed me, I was all aflame.
