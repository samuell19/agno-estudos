(suspenseful music) (dramatic suspenseful music) - [Alex] Bless me Father for I have sinned. - You mean forgive, don't you? - [Alex] Whatever. - Confess your sins. - [Alex] Why don't you confess a few of yours Father? It's quite a racket you've got going here with the local cyborg bosses. Using your church to smuggle their drugs. - I don't know what you are talking about. - [Alex] Sure you do Father. Only you've been caught dipping into the shipments for your own pocket. Shame on you and your God. - I am only a priest here to confess your sins. - Bullshit. (clanging) (electricity buzzing) (groaning) (thumping) (thudding) Say 10 hail Marys and go to cyborg hell. (eerie music) (suspenseful music) Do you hear angels crying? (gun firing) (screaming) (dramatic music) (dramatic energetic music) (eerie music) (suspenseful music) (electronic pulsating) - Sloppy, that's the word that comes to mind. - I'm not sloppy Bernardo. - That was a mess down there in Mexico, a mess. My clients weren't happy. They expect more, I expect more Alex. It's time you considered retiring. Look at what you're doing to yourself Alex. - I like to workout. - Look at yourself. You've deformed your genetics because your heart's not in the job anymore. For your line of work you need to blend in. You need to look like you're a normal human. What you've done to yourself, it makes no sense. Right, you're a genetic mutant and many other people look odd like you, but you don't look anything like your species anymore. You stand out too much. You're a goddamn electric sign that says look at me, I'm a mutant. (electronic pulsating) There's only one good reason you've done this. You know it's over for you Alex. There comes a time when all cyborg killers have to recognize they've reached the end. You're there Alex. Do this one last job. Be a professional. Be smart about this. - Who do I kill today Bernardo? - Promise me Alex you'll consider retiring before it's too late. - It's already way too late. Who do I kill Bernardo? Just give me the victim's name. - Roberto Ricon, a class three human variant, 96% cybergenic. You'll know him 'cause he always wears a little white carnation when he goes to find a synthetic hooker. And he goes to find a hooker every Saturday night. The florist at his hotel will call you when he calls for his flower. He buys the flower and comes down to the bar looking to get laid. The carnation is a good luck thing. Cyber mojo sex thing. Makes his industrial erection harder or some sort of nonsense like that. - What is it with them? - You know how they are. They like to think they're all human. - You think you're human? - God I hope not, what a sad life that would be, but I suppose we all want to be what we're not. Look at how humans convert themselves with cyber transplants in order to be more state of the art. We all want to be what we're not Alex, just like you. You pretend to care, but you don't. You're a killer, that's what you were created to be. It's all you'll ever be. Yet you try to deny it. You pretend to be troubled by it, but I don't buy it. You want to go off and live in peace, but peace is not why you exist Alex, destruction is. We all want to be what we're not. - Is he going to want to go with me or do I need to do something special? - He's a weird kinky hybrid Alex. He likes anything that's weird and sick. That's why I called you. You're perfect for this one. With your body he'll bite. But I don't want him killed at the hotel. We're connected to the owners. It would be bad for my business. So take him out somewhere quiet and kill him. Do you have somewhere to take him Alex? - Mm-hm. An old factory area. - I don't want any mistakes on this one. It's for a very important cartel client and I want to impress him. - I don't make mistakes Bernardo, you know that. I've never been less than perfect. - And you want to keep it that way so make this the last one Alex. - I'll think about it. - I don't want to see you get sloppy and make a mistake. I'd have to have you killed. (electronic pulsating) Most killers go out that way, but you don't have to Alex. You've been good for my business, very good. I want you to get out alive. Just this one last kill and promise you'll retire. What is it Alex, what's wrong? - When I killed that priest I saw a woman, she was dressed in black. - Did you know her? - Nuh-uh, I don't think so. - Then she's no problem, this woman in black. - What do you think of angels? - Angels? - When I saw the woman in black I thought of angels. Crying angels. - Forget it. You've got business to do. - If I quit then what? - You try to forget about the killing, forget about me, and look for some reason to go on. - What kind of life is that? - It's the only life you can expect. You're a killer. You've killed a lot of people Alex. That's a heavy thing to carry in your soul, but you'll have your health, you'll be alive. That's more than most killers can say and you can't have everything can you? (carefree jazz music) (wind howling) (groaning) - You are making a mistake. - You picked me up, you wanted to cyber fuck me. You are cyber fucking me. - I didn't know you were just a human whore. It was my mistake. I don't do it with human whores, even genetic mutants, even with protection. I'll retract my bollocks. - Mistakes happen. In my business you make a mistake you pay up. - I'll pay up, it's not about money, I have good money. It's about you being what you are. I'm sorry. I can't do it with looks like you. You are dirty and too human. I prefer cyborgs. I have to have a female who is cyber enhancing. I need more DSCI slots than you've got. - You're mildly insulting. - Look, you are not what I thought you were. It's my mistake, okay, all of it. Can't we just stop and go back to my hotel? To my people. They will be worried about me leaving them like I did. - Well you went pretty far with me. I'm practically naked and you've got all your manhood plugs hanging out. - I said I'd pay you. Can't we just stop now and go back to my hotel? - It's your rental car, you can drive it wherever you want. - Thanks. I thought you were going to be trouble. - Trouble, what kind of trouble? - Like to rip me off or something. (chuckling) Or worse. - What could be worse? - Well, I thought you were here with the FBI. That's why I went as far as I did even if I knew what you are. Look I had to know if you were a cop. That's why I brought you out here, to see how far you would go. A cop will only go so far. - Mm-hm. Is this far enough for you? - What do you mean? (suspenseful music) (cracking) (electricity buzzing) (groaning) (gurgling) (electricity buzzing) (thwacking) (electronic groaning) (electricity buzzing) (electricity buzzing) - Clever little hard drive you've got here. Messy, I hate these messy ones. So what did you see as you were about to die Roberto? The angel of death? She tells you where you're going. Heaven if the angel sings, hell if the angel cries. Which one did she do for you handsome? It's a dangerous world and you've got to be careful, but you got sloppy in your business Roberto. You crossed the wrong man and then let your dick do the thinking. Careless and sloppy, that's what you were Roberto. (eerie suspenseful music) (wind howling) (suspenseful music) - You know we talked about a little bit of trust here. None the less I'll alright, okay, hold on. (laughing) That one go well? - It's done. Did you see somebody around? - No witness, no. Why? - I saw someone. Forget it, I'm tired. (sighing) - I hope not too tired. - Then let's go somewhere else. - You always get so revved up after a job. (laughing) - Let's go. (thwacking) Now. (gasping) I don't want to hang around here. (groaning) - Oh, I like you after a job. You're all worked up 'cause you interrupt yourself before you do it. Can't go all the way and then kill them. - I did once and almost got killed. Let's go Earl, I'm really jacked up. - Earl Typhoon understands. Surely he does. I know you want it. So why don't we? - Not here, not now. Not at the job site. It's too risky Earl. (sighing) - What's life, life without a little risk, hm? Who's gonna find a body here for days? (horn honking) (moaning) (electricity buzzing) (electrical whirring) (electricity buzzing) (moaning) (electricity buzzing) (electrical whirring) I'm sorry I have to do this. I'm so sorry. It's not a forgiving world Alex. Can't be sloppy. You can't make mistakes. You know that better than anybody else. Yes you do. Yes you do. No wonder I was gonna have to kill you. You want to know why, hm? (chuckling) You know why, I know you do, yes you do. It seems that you killed someone today that shouldn't have been and someone wants to get squared. - The only person I killed today was 10 minutes ago. - You saw me on the phone. I was supposed to stop you. It wasn't too late. But it was. You picked up the wrong person. You understand? You got the word a little too late. It's just so easy these days. You can't be too careful. It's so easy to take out the wrong person. You got to think about each kill. Make sure you don't fuck yourself. - [Alex] Guess I got sloppy on this one Earl. - Yes you did. You should've checked out your victim. - I wanted to finish early. I wanted to fuck you. (chuckling) - You're gonna be finishing early. Only it's you who's gonna get fucked. - I thought we had something here Earl, you and me. - Something, what? What, we've been screwing Saturday night, last night. What'd we do it 12, 13 times? (chuckling) That ain't something. It was just a little over night fuckathon. That's all we got between us baby. - I really thought we could have something more. - You're just trying to mess with me Alex. It's going to make me put the bullet in you that much quicker. - We've known each other a long time Earl. I always thought you liked me. - How could anyone take a freak like you serious? Fucking you was a trip. I had my fun. I had my fantasy fulfilled, but it's done. It's done. Back to business. - You said you liked me Earl. (chuckling) - I'm a friendly guy. I say that to everyone. - I like you Earl. (chuckling) Everyone likes old Earl Typhoon. That's why I'm so damn good at what I do. Damn. (suspenseful music) (groaning) Shit. (thumping) (groaning) (cracking) (groaning) (thumping) (groaning) (yelling) (electricity buzzing) (thumping) - Okay then. Typhoon. (thwacking) (electricity buzzing) (screaming) Now you know why I don't fuck the victim till afterwards. (screaming) (electricity buzzing) It fucking messes with your focus. (screaming) (electricity buzzing) (electricity buzzing) (sizzling) Earl. Bet you here the angel crying don't you Earl? Shit. (wind howling) (eerie music) What do you want? (dogs barking) (bells tolling) (dogs barking) (eerie music) (phone beeping) (phone ringing) - Yes Alex what can I do for you? - Got a problem Bernardo. - You messed up the kill, the victim's still alive? - No the guy's dead, but Earl just tried to kill me. - That's not good Alex. Weren't you friends? - I guess friendship's not worth much anymore is it? - Why would he try to kill you Alex? - Something about killing the wrong guy today. Somebody hired Earl to hit me for that. - So fast. How could that be? You only just killed your victim a few minutes ago. - I don't know how it happened, but somebody hired Earl to kill me. - Who could that be? - Earl wouldn't say. - Well Alex I'm the only one you've worked with for the last 13 years so if you're in trouble I'm in trouble. This isn't good. - No, everything's under control. - Let me ask you this, did you kill the right person Alex? - [Alex On Phone] What kind of question is that? Of course I did. He was wearing a white carnation. - He looked cyborg Hispanic? - He looked cyborg Hispanic enough. - Was he cyborg Hispanic Alex? - He sounded cyborg Hispanic, why, what's the problem? - No, you did right. Except you're out there with Earl's body. That's not good. - I'm here with both bodies. Earl and I never left the area. Look I'm just gonna leave them and walk away. I just wanted you to know that when the shit hit the fan. - I appreciate you telling me Alex. Could I ask you a favor? Would you mind waiting there a bit longer? I'm sending someone out to take care of Earl. I don't want him found with the hit. It looks bad for business, bodies lying everywhere. It sends the wrong message. - Why do I have to wait? - The cleaner may need your help. Besides I'll make sure to send money and data just in case you need it. - Okay, I'll wait by Earl's car. Who's coming out? - I'll find someone on short notice. You just wait near the car and don't you worry about a thing. Thank you for calling Alex. As always it's been a pleasure. Alex. - Yeah? - Have you given any more thought to what we talked about? - Uh-huh. Maybe you're right, maybe it's time to get out. - Good girl. (electronic pulsating) I'm really very sorry about this. Alex has always been 100%. - [Man] Until today. - My mutant boy Earl failed too. I'm not having a very good day am I? - [Man] No, but my cyborg Zip Tokuda won't fail Bernardo. Pray we get this squared away or Mr. Massimo might want your head as well as this girl's. Now that would be very very bad for your business. (phone beeping) - Theodore, it's Alex. Can you check the net for me to see who's got anything out on me. Yeah I'll hold. Nothing at all? That's strange. Yeah I got a bad feeling about this too. Thanks Theodore. (dramatic suspenseful music) (plane droning) - You're dying. - I'm not dying. - Soon. - Who are you? - When you learn that you will be dead. - You're an angel? - I'll show you to the next life. - They really tried to kill me out here. - They've already tried it once and will try again and again. I think I'll wait to see how the show plays out. (helicopter buzzing) (suspenseful music) - I don't believe this. (guns firing) (alarm buzzing) (electricity buzzing) (helicopter whooshing) (explosion booming) Are you here to kill me? - I'm here to take you, yeah. - Who sent you? - Everyone sent me. And no one sent me. - Who the fuck are you? Fuck you. Fine, kill me if you like. If you're not gonna kill me get out of here and leave me alone. - You are lonely and afraid, but you don't see it like that because death is near. - Angel of death, that's what you want me to think. - I'll be around Alex waiting to see who wins. - You fucking vulture. - I'll pick up the leftovers. - Damn you. (dramatic suspenseful music) (bell tolling) (engine rumbling) (dog barking) - All fucking right. Whoa. You look marvelous. Come on. (clanging) Alex? - Party on. - Well, maybe you haven't lost as much of the edge as they say. You're still one tough bitch aren't you? Tokuda is one tough bitch too. And Tokuda can play hard ball. Alex? Are you around? I'm Tokuda the oscillator. Bernardo sent me to help you out of this situation. Come on, let me see you. (suspenseful music) Alex? Alex? Come on bitch burger. I've got places to go and people to kill. Alex? Alex is that you? Alex I'm here to help. There's no need to be scared of me. I don't want to hurt you. Alex, I'm Tokuda the Oscillator. I heard a lot about you for a long time. I heard you're a real creative pro. I'm so pleased to finally meet you. (thudding) (electricity buzzing) (groaning) Oh man. You bitch. I can't believe you smashed my face. Do you know how much time I put into it? - Too much. - Oh it's times like these I wish I didn't have a human processor. It's a drag to have the ability to access pain. - But it also allows you to feel good. - That's why I have the damn thing. Don't get me wrong, I love to feel my kills, but I don't like the feel of getting killed. Say, you don't have the reputation for being a sadist. Your style is supposed to be quick and clean. - I'm trying something new in my old age. - Oh no. Fuck, not today Alex. Finish me quick. Be a fucking pro. - Who wants me dead? - I don't deserve this. (thudding) (screaming) (electricity buzzing) - Are you listening to me? (screaming) - Oh god. (groaning) (thumping) Oh shit! Yes I'm listening to you. - I've got your full attention? - Oh yeah. You've got it, you've got it. - Who wants me dead? - The guy you killed today, he was Carlos Massimos' only child. - Carlos Massimo, the head of the Brazilian cartel. - Oh you made a bad enemy Alex. He wants you dead. And he's put a 100 million dollar price on your head. Everyone in the business is looking to collect. You're fucked Alex. There's not a chance in hell that everyone's not gonna try to kill you. I heard even Mother's looking for you. - Leave Mother out of this. - You understand what I'm saying? There's not a place in the world you can hide. You don't have more than a couple of hours to live tops. You're fucked! Shit. Doesn't look like you're gonna make it much longer anyhow. Earl got you huh? Oh man those claw incisors, they were so cool. I've been thinking of having some implanted myself, but they're expensive. - I don't get it. The guy I killed was the hit. Bernardo set it up and the cyborg walked right into me like he was supposed to. - The way I heard it there was a mix up at the hotel. Carlos Jr. must've seen you and got distracted. (chuckling) He got to you just before your hit could show up. (chuckling) You left with the wrong machine. - But he was wearing the white carnation. - When your hit ordered the white carnation the flower delivery robot ran into Carlos Jr. in the elevator. Carlos Jr. scored one for himself then he saw you... And that was it. (chuckling) The rest is, well, it's all been an unfortunate chain of events for you. Poor Carlos Jr., he was at the wrong place at the wrong time, twice. - [Alex] How could I have known? - That's not the point Alex. You fucked up, that's all that matters. - But why weren't bodyguards with Carlos Jr.? (chuckling) - Who would be stupid enough to mess with Carlos Massimo's only child. The fact that his father is a powerful and ruthless crime boss was his protection. I mean if anybody even looked at Carlos Jr. the wrong way it was certain death. Besides he did have protection, but he gave him slip just before he ran into you. In fact they saw the two of you leave together. That's how they knew to contact Bernardo so quickly. - When I called Bernardo I confirmed I had killed Carlos Jr. - Uh-huh and that was it for you babe. (sighing) And here we are. - I'm fucked. (chuckling) - You're so totally fucked Alex it's un-fucking-believable. In fact, (chuckling) I feel sorry for you. So, why don't we make a deal? Why don't we do something good for the both of us? - What kind of deal? - I split the 100 million with you if you don't kill me and let me kill you. (chuckling) - How do we get away with that? - Do you understand what I'm saying Alex? I really mean kill you, you die. You have to let me shoot you dead so we can collect the reward. - What good is my share of the 100 million? - You give it to somebody you like, somebody you care about. Parents, wives, lovers, children, whatever. - But I don't have anybody so it looks like no deal. You're going to have to die. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold it, hold it. I heard through the grapevine that you and some guy had something going. - Earl Typhoon. Yeah me and Earl's dick had something going for 48 hours, but now it's dead in that car with Earl and like you're gonna be. - Hold on. There's gotta be a way out of this mess. I mean after all we two are best in our business and our business isn't for dummies. I mean it's worth taking a moment to think about a way out of this mess. - It helps me think. I do a lot of thinking. - You got great tits. Where'd you buy them? You like to have sex with your victims don't you? That's your style. You like to fuck 'em up to a point and then really fuck 'em, huh? So you don't like to use a gun, huh? No heat, just physical contact. Like to press the flesh. You just fuck 'em and then you kill 'em. You know what that's all about don't you? It's about being used. That's what it comes down to. Some deep psychological thing of not being created for a purpose, unfulfilled. (chuckling) Man our business sure attracts weirdos, freaks, like you and me. It's funny how we get our styles from the way we grow up. Me, I was a wimp in military school. I got beat up all the time. (radar beeping) And ended up in jail from shoplifting and getting into cyber juice where I was gang raped by a bunch of heavy metal androids. It was ugly and unpleasant. Those alloy freaks have probes and peripherals that can't be believed. Now I just like to see things die slowly. I like to hear things beg me real loud for a real long time and then I watch them die. And that makes me happy. - You take the time to torture your victims before you kill them? (chuckling) - I torture my way, you do it yours although they probably enjoy your way a little better than mine. Well then again maybe they don't. - And you were gonna do me here? - Take a look at that gun. It shoots tasers, not bullets. I was gonna incapacitate you and take you to my workshop in Santa Monica after I was through, (chuckling) I would've called Carlos Senior to tell him you were dead. Then I'd deliver your head to Carlos Senior and collect 100 million. Money doesn't really matter all that much to me although 100 million certainly gets my attention. - Money's never meant that much to me. - Yeah, ditto. - You really like your work. - Alex don't pretend you're any better than me. We're both sick fucks. - I only kill the ones that deserve it. (chuckling) - Are you saying your shit don't stink? Nothing pisses me off than a goddamn hypocrite. - I only kill people in the industry. - Oh yeah, and innocent people like Carlos Jr. - He wasn't innocent. He would've become a boss like his father. - You are a professional Alex and he was a mistake, a big mistake, your mistake. Now Carlos Massimo wants you dead and he's willing to pay 100 million dollars to have it done. I'm glad this happened because professional killing has to have certain minimum standards and bleeding heart moralists like you need to be kicked out of the industry if we are to maintain the high level of, anyway I've had it with you. This is a business for ruthless people. - Shut up. (gun firing) (electricity buzzing) (suspenseful music) (electricity buzzing) Is the angel crying? (dogs barking) (engine rumbling) (suspenseful music) (guns firing) You can spend it in hell motherfucker. (gun firing) (clanging) (explosion booming) (dramatic suspenseful music) (helicopter buzzing) (suspenseful music) (phone beeping) (phone ringing) - [Man On Phone] Hello, you've reached Carlos Massimo's. - This is Alex Sinclair. I just wanted to talk to you about your son Carlos Jr. - [Woman On Phone] I'll connect you to Mr. Massimo, stand by. - [Carlos On Phone] This is Carlos Senior Miss Sinclair. - Call me Alex. - I will call you that. - It was an honest mistake. - People in your business must never make mistakes. There is no excuse for it. - There's nothing I can do or say. - [Carlos On Phone] I haven't told Carlos Jr.'s mother yet. Is there anything that can be done or said that will ease her suffering? - Only my death. - [Carlos On Phone] Then we understand each other. - Yes sir. - [Carlos On Phone] I have heard how good you used to be. What happened? - Getting old I guess. - And sloppy. There's no place for a sloppy killer. You can see that? - Yes I do. Please give my condolences to Mrs. Massimo. - [Carlos On Phone] I'll see to her, goodbye. (helicopter buzzing) (helicopters whooshing) (phone beeping) - Johnny Impact? - Alex, where are you? - Have you heard? - [Johnny On Phone] Everyone has. Words travel fast around 100 million. (dramatic music) - I want you to get it Johnny. - [Johnny On Phone] You want me to kill you? - I want you to have the money. - [Johnny On Phone] Don't you at least want to try to escape? I'll help you. - We both know that's not gonna happen. - [Johnny On Phone] Why me Alex? I thought you hated my guts. You said you never wanted to see me again after we broke up. - I only knew killers and you're the most honorable killer I ever met. I want you to do it. - [Johnny On Phone] You sure about this? - Yeah. - [Johnny On Phone] I've been tracing your phone since you called. I have your position. - The others are all around me. They're closing in, I can feel it. - [Johnny On Phone] I'll get there as quick as I can Alex. (wind blowing) - Johnny. (dramatic music) (moaning) Do it now. Do it now, please. Please. (gun cocking) The angel's singing. (suspenseful dramatic music) (gun firing) (electricity buzzing) The Mother. - Bernardo sent his own partner to make sure you were killed. - It was a setup. - Right from the start. Bernardo arranged for you to kill Carlos Jr. on purpose. And with Mother killing you and I Bernardo and this bitch would collect 100 million, but it doesn't change a thing. You did kill Carlos Jr. and for that Massimo is still gonna have you killed. - I guess you're just gonna have to kill me Johnny. (dramatic suspenseful music) (helicopters whooshing) (phone beeping) (phone ringing) - Bernardo. It's Johnny Impact. I've got Alex. She was a little hard to find. She's changed her hair. Uh-huh. I'll send over her encoding now. Transmitting. (electronic beeping) You've confirmed the demise? Uh-huh. Yeah. Have my money waiting Bernardo. No, I won't forget her head. (electronic pulsating) - 100 million dollars is a lot of money Johnny Impact. What are you going to do? - I don't know, get away, go live a happy life somewhere. - You think 100 million dollars can buy you happiness? - Sure it will. - It won't buy you peace, peace is happiness. Take my advice, go find the good in the world. You need to be close to it for a while to remember what it's like. - And that'll take away the guilt? - Only one thing can do that, death. That's what Alex found out. - You think she made that mistake on purpose? - Subconsciously, yes. She was never a sloppy killer, but she made a lot of mistakes in the end. - She was tired wasn't she? All that working out. - I think she was always headed this way with her DNA background and all, she was always a tool. First the humans, then me. Maybe now she can be her own boss. - She was never very happy. - But she died happy didn't she? You said Alex mentioned something about an angel singing. What do you suppose that meant? - I haven't a goddamn clue. She was crazy at the end. Naked and pumped up and bleeding. She was a mess all the way around. - Whatever it was it made her happy. - As happy as you can be when you're dead. - Singing angels. It's funny, I've only ever heard them cry. - Call Massimo first. Confirm the delivery. - Relax, I called him right after talking to you. - I didn't see anything posted on the net. Contracts are still out on this job. - They're waiting to take delivery of the head before calling it off. - Call him now Bernardo. Cancel the contract. - Mind if I confirm the head first? - Okay. (eerie music) She resisted. - Couldn't go any other way. I wish she had retired. (gun firing) (electricity buzzing) (footsteps thudding) - You double crossed me. - And you got me, we're even. - Now we're both dead. - Whose head was it? - Mother's. - I figured as much when I didn't hear from her. - Make the call. I'll let you off easy. - Why not? It's the least I can do. (electronic beeping) Alex Sinclair is dead. I have confirmation. I'll send you her head. Yes. Cancel the contracts. (electronic beeping) Transfer it to Johnny Impact's account. Yes, but he did it once. As always Senor Massimo it's been a pleasure. (electronic beeping) I'm sorry about your son. Goodbye. (electronic beeping) - Why'd you do it? - I simply wanted to retire in grand style. I saw the hit on Carlos Jr. as the opportune time. After this job I knew my business was over. I'm retiring. What'll you do now? - Disappear. - Alex. Do you think the angels will sing for me? - Who the fuck cares Bernardo? (gun firing) (dramatic music) (energetic music) (dramatic music)
