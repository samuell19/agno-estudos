I was looking for you. She's on. Quarantine has gotten a lot more unbearable since I graduated college. I was excited to have the place to myself after my roommates left. But a lot of free time and a lot of free space has just given me more places to do absolutely fucking nothing in. Well, except talk to myself. If only overthinking things was my only pre-existing condition. That was nice. I needed that. ♪ December 31st I grabbed a beer ♪ ♪ Threw it up, said, "2020 is my year, bitches" ♪ ♪ Three, two, one, Happy New Year! ♪ ♪ And I honestly Thought that that was true ♪ ♪ Until I gave This motherfucker ♪ ♪ Like a month or two ♪ ♪ This is getting Kind of ridiculous ♪ ♪ At this point ♪ ♪ Yo, my cat died ♪ ♪ And a global pandemic Took over my life ♪ ♪ And I put out some music That nobody liked ♪ ♪ So I got really sad and bored At the same time ♪ ♪ And that's why I'm like ♪ ♪ Low-key fuck 2020 ♪ ♪ Still sad, still ain't Got no money ♪ ♪ I ain't got a watch Up on my wrist ♪ ♪ I just got some shit I gotta fix, yeah ♪ ♪ Low-key fuck 2020 ♪ ♪ I don't know About everybody else ♪ ♪ But I think that I am kinda done ♪ ♪ Can we just get To 2021, please ♪ ♪ Low-key fuck 2020 ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ I know this has been said, but it's really rude when they do that.

I was gonna wait until you cave and do it. Oh, okay, yeah, that sounds about right. I like it. Christmas in January. Thank you. - It's cute. - Okay, yeah. - I'm just saying. - Mm-hmm. Hey. What? I asked if anybody wanted any. I just wanted a little. Don't be so defensive. Defensive. Scooch! Um, there's just not really room. Oh, okay. Do you mind? Oh, what, is this not comfortable? - How about this? - Oh, okay, sure. - It's your funeral. - Oh! - Stop! - There are feet on me... - No, I can't... you know I can't. - Mm-hmm. ...that belong to Amanda. Do you think you're gonna survive? - Um, no. - Yeah? - Yeah? - No. - It's not super fun? - Stop it, stop, it, stop it. You have reached the Greystone Center for Cystic Fibrosis and Advanced Lung Disease. Please leave us your name, number, and the best time of day to contact you, and someone from our office will get back to you same day or our next business day. Additionally, if this is a medical emergency, please hang up and dial... Nine-one-one. Thank you! I don't get why I need to hear that every single time I call. If I were having an actual medical emergency, I would be dead by the time they reached that part. Hi, this is Terese Jackson. I was just calling to get a refill on my Creon. Um, you can reach me back at 513-555-6322. Thank you! I've had a lung disease my entire life. I think I know when to call 911. I mean, when do you think classes will be back? I don't know, everyone's saying, like, two, three weeks. Yeah, okay. How are we gonna protect you? I don't know. Hey, hey, it's okay. We're here for you. I just... I don't wanna do this. I know. Hey. We can do this. Okay? No one here is getting COVID. I simply won't allow it. Yeah, it's all about the mindset, right? Just have to manifest it. I mean, we're in LA. I think I could maybe survive COVID. I think we can do better than maybe. I hate being high-risk in the pandemic. Makes it a lot harder to pretend to be a normal person. Hey... Hey, honey. Are you busy right now? I haven't been busy in months. You know there's a way to fix that. Oh, my God. You found a cure for Coronavirus. Mom, have you notified The Post? Ha-ha. No! But you know I would if I could, anything to keep you safe. But I meant finding a job? Something to fill your time. Wow, that took her all of one minute to bring up. New record. Yeah, I know. It's just that jobs aren't exactly flying off the shelves right now, so... Right. Well... What are you gonna do with your life? I don't know. It's just... it's the end of the world right now. The world is literally ending, and no one is really thinking long-term so... The world's not ending. It's on pause. And so is your ambition, apparently. How's your health? I know you've been staying safe, which is great. I'm already anxious enough thinking of what CF is doing to your lungs without COVID in the mix. But are you feeling all right? I'm fine. Have you been doing your treatments? Yep. Do they still have you on the inhaled albuterol? Because I remember your doctor saying that that really helps to get all the mucus up when you do it with the vest. Gotta imagine that's more important than ever since you're so inactive nowadays. With so much free time, honey, your health really should be your top priority. I know it's, like, weird times right now and everything... Sometimes, I feel like I'm patient first and daughter second. Her nagging just makes me wanna do my treatments less. Even when she's a four-hour plane ride away. I know they're important, or whatever, but it's not like I'm gonna die if I don't do them for a few days. It's hard to be proactive when it doesn't feel like there's any future to plan for. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Holy fuck. Are you waving at me? What am I doing? What am I doing? Why am I doing that? Why am I waving like that? Oh, my God, hi! Wee! Oh, my gosh! - I've missed your face. - Aww. I miss you. I miss everyone. I miss everything. I mean, I even miss Tyler. - Don't kill me, okay? - Okay. We might be getting back together. Okay! Honestly... Get it where you can, sis. I can't even hate on you. The last time... I can't even recall the last time I've been touched, even non-sexually, by another person. You're being that strict? Yeah. What are you doing? - I mean, nothing crazy. - Mm-hmm. Julia and Miguel come over a lot. Sometimes, I hang out with Steph and Trish. Oh, and Jackson. And, of course, Tyler. Mm. Look... I... I wanna do my part to, like, stop the spreading stuff, but I feel like we're young; we can afford a few more risks. Yeah, pfft. We... I mean, yeah. Like, we're young. My friend's mom, she has cancer, so imagine what she has to go through. I mean, she can't see absolutely anybody... She has to... Terese? Uh, yeah. I guess we need some house rules. What are you thinkin'? Uh, well, everything they're recommending to the public but to the extreme. Like, I don't wanna take any risks. What does that mean? Don't go anywhere, don't see anyone, increased hygiene... We can't leave? Unless it's absolutely, completely necessary. Well, what counts as necessary? Where are you trying to go? Everything is either cancelled or closed. Well, how long is this gonna last? How should I know? Have you thought about going home? No. No. I'd go crazy with my mom. I am... Going home. My mom doesn't want me staying in the city. I know, dude. Same. My mom was texting me, like, 25 times today. Wait, so we're just on lockdown? Like, I can't even go see my boyfriend? I mean, we can factor Zack in as well. But I don't think anyone should be going in or out. So what, I'm like a prisoner in this house, and I can't even see my boyfriend? I'm just saying for now. Until we know more. Please... Well, how long? I don't know. I don't know, and I wish I did. I do. But I don't. Well, if you're gonna be like that, then I obviously can't stay here. Um, maybe I can go stay with Zack. This is not about how I'm gonna be. This is what I have to do. This pandemic means way different things for me than it does for you. Well, the world doesn't revolve around you, Terese. I don't want it to. Oh, God. Amanda? - Hey! - Hey! What are you doing here? Um, I live here. Except you haven't lived here for, like, a while now. Well, I still pay rent. Right. Uh, how are you and Zack doing? Uh, it's been better. We just... needed a little break, close quarters and all. Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. Oh, it's no big deal. We'll get through it. So why didn't you tell me you were coming? Sorry, I didn't know I needed to ask permission. Um... You've really nested here. Yeah, well, a little heads up would have been nice. - I would have cleaned. - Mm-hmm. This should be interesting. I mean, how can she just come back? Like things are any different now. I guess I have to give her a chance. It's not like I can just kick her out, but I don't know where she's been. She could have been playing beer die with Zack's bros, for all I know. Although beer die is probably the easiest drinking game to social distance during. But... ...still, I don't like this. I just love Julianne Moore. She was so pretty. I mean, she's still beautiful. Yeah, but not like this. That's kind of fucked up. That's like the ageist bullshit Hollywood always spins. Whatever. Ope, she's gonna die. What? Spoilers! I have never seen this movie before in my life. All I'm saying is when a character coughs in a movie, it's foreshadowing that they're gonna, like, die of cancer, or AIDS, or something. As if the first sign of cancer or AIDS is a cough... Shh... I'm trying to watch. It's a pretty foolproof system. If a character coughs, they die. Maybe that's why people are always so concerned when I causally cough. It's been subconsciously ingrained into them that it means I'm gonna, like, die or something. And I am, but not, like, soon... I think. Don't you think that's kind of creepy? Jesus, Amanda! Just saying. You're drooling. You should shoot your shot. Oh, my God. It's a pandemic. I can't just go around dating random dudes. You could do it from a distance. Oh, my God, it would be like Five Feet Apart. Okay, that's really insensitive. And also, no it wouldn't because he doesn't have CF. How do you know? Because it would just be way too ironic. Where are you going? Just getting a coffee. Do you have a mask? Duh! Look. All I'm saying is if you're so starved for a relationship, you have the perfect potential man gardening on the other side of this duplex. Whatever! And also, I'm not starved for a relationship. I just want some dick! God, I really hope he didn't hear that. Then again... - Hey. - Hey! So, um, I think just maybe we should be, um, limiting how much we're going out. I mean, I just got a coffee, For the third time this week. Terese, don't worry. I'm being careful. Okay, can you just wash your hands please? Yeah, I was going to. I just got home. Just give me the chance to. Okay? She barely even told me she was coming back, and the reason she left hasn't changed at all. And I feel like I'm gonna get COVID, and it's gonna be all her fault. Ooh, okay. That's a little extreme. Yeah, I can't help but feel she's being irresponsible and she's going outside though. But you can't know how she's acting. Exactly. That's my issue. I feel like I've lost all control with her back. Well, I know how you like your control. Have you tried talking to her about it? Yes. No, I mean actually talking to her about it. Like setting ground rules, making your standards explicitly clear. I guess you're right. I just, like... my anxiety's running my life. And it can be... Overwhelming when... you let your anxiety consume the people around you as well. Wait, is that how you felt? Is that why you, like, you left earlier than... No, no, no, no. My mom made me come home. Um... But yeah. Like, I did feel that way a little bit. I... I didn't mind it too much though because I know how important this is for you. Amanda knows you have CF. But I don't think she understands what that means. But she's just a sub-leaser. A sub-leaser who's gonna be here for the next year. Just tell her. It'll make your life easier. - Hey. - Hey! So I just... uh, I just wanted to talk to you. Um, I guess you should know about me. Well, since we're gonna be living together, I just... Um, I thought you should know that, um... I have Cystic Fibrosis. Oh. Yeah, no, yeah. It's not... It's not a big deal or anything. Um... It's just, like, you might see some, like, equipment, uh, laying around or, like, just... Okay. Yeah! Uh, yeah. Cool. Well... Now that you know, that is a cool fun fact that you know about me. Okay. I'll talk to you later. That's a really good juice, that. See ya later. It's just like it's so much easier being alone. You sure? But you're not alone anymore. - Hey. - Mm. What's up? This. Looks like we have the same idea. Since when are you a big drinker? Quarantine has a tendency to change things. Can you just, um, wipe that down though please? Uh, okay. Yeah, can you just maybe thorough... Terese, look... I'm not irresponsible or anything. Can you stop watching me like a hawk? Okay, I'm sorry. I don't mean to be, like, backseat cleaning, but I just... I realized we haven't had a proper conversation about COVID safety procedures since you've been back, and I... I really just do need a little bit more from you. What, do you want me to get tested more? Sure, I mean, getting tested more would be great, but by the time you tested positive, you would have already exposed me. And I'm just trying to think of ways we can both avoid exposure in general. For me, best practice is to kind of overreact, and with CF, it... like, I just... I have to be at a higher alert for this kind of stuff, so... It just makes me really anxious. Yeah. I can tell. I realize I should have said this right when you got back, but I just need you to be at the same level of precaution as me or it... it's just kind of all for nothing then. Okay. So what are the rules? Okay, well everything that comes into the house has to be wiped down. I mean, sanitized completely. Sanitize your hands. Wash your hands right after. Leave all the bags in the trash. Make sure that you always have gloves on whenever you're outside. Sanitize the gloves when you have the chance. Keep your mask on. I know it... That was definitely expired. Maybe I shouldn't have finished it. Oh, my God. Okay. Wait. Um... Okay. Amanda said... to shoot my shot. Right? I mean, I guess it couldn't hurt. What do I say...? Hey! Hey. Uh, how are you? Lonely. All alone in this apartment. Respecting quarantine to the highest level. I could really use someone to keep me company. Do you know anyone who's available? Anyone at all? What? I said, "Did you hear about the protests?" They're happening down the street. Oh, that is what... yeah, that's... that is definitely what you said. Um, yes! Are you going to that? Yeah! Are you? No. No, 'cause I... just 'cause I'm, like, so busy, and like, my schedule is packed! Ridiculous. This girl's got emails. Yeah, no, that sounds really cool though. Uh, and I hope you have a lot of fun. You're plants look really good... right now. And your hair. You left. Fun? Fun. Why did I say fun? Protests aren't fun. They are important and necessary, but they aren't fun. Although I guess I wouldn't know because my fear of catching COVID and dying has kept me from attending, but God... now he probably thinks I am this terrible person with my packed fucking schedule, like, "Sorry, no time to fight for justice. I have to pretend to respond to emails."

Mm-hmm. Were you gonna wipe those down like we talked about? Yeah, I just... I got in, and I just... I forgot. I'm sorry. It's just so much to remember. It's a lot sometimes, I know. Then why do you do it? Because I have to. But you said it yourself; you're kind of overreacting. I mean, wiping my fruit down just doesn't seem like it should be that big of a deal. Well, it is. The small things matter. It's just like she makes me feel like I'm being the selfish one. It's not fun for me, you know? Do you think she got it? Like, when you explained CF and the COVID dangers and all that a little bit more? Maybe I should just go home. Really? Why, is it a bad idea? You were just always so against it. Yeah, but if there's anyone who won't flack me for my control issues, it's my mom. Learned from the best. What the fuck? I saw your story. Did you go to a restuarant? Oh, yeah. Didn't it look so good? Why would you do that? Well, I went to go get take-out but decided I wanted it hot. It doesn't matter. It's not safe. Well, if it weren't safe, why would they be open? Because the American government is incompetent? Because the economy has been deemed more important than people's health? Well, you don't even care about your health. What are you talking about? You smoke every single day. Okay. And? I slack on my treatments, and I might not take my meds every day, but that's kind of none of your business. Well, I just think it's a little hypocritical that you yell at me for going out when you don't even take care of yourself. My slacking on a long-term treatment plan is nowhere near the same thing as not wanting to die of COVID. But I remember you saying you thought you could survive COVID. Yeah. I was probably being hopeful. And it's not just about surviving it. You know, I could probably live but my lungs would never recover. I... I didn't think that... Yeah. You didn't. Amanda, you should probably go back to Zack's and just make both of our lives easier if you can... Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't... I don't mean to kick you out. It's just, like, if you can't take this seriously, then... No. I can't go back to Zack's. The break is kind of indefinite. We got in a big fight and... I thought it was just a break, but he hasn't called or texted or anything. So maybe you should call him. No. I'm not ready for that. Um, 'cause... what if he answers and confirms that it's over? Yeah, yeah. Take your time, do what you need to do to get over him. - Yeah. - Yeah. And, Amanda, stick to take-out... please. Okay. Hello? Hey, it's me. Hi, honey! Ah! What a nice surprise. Is everything all right? Yes, I'm fine. I was just... calling, um, 'cause I was wondering what it would, like, be like if I were to come home. Ah! Really? Well, I would love to have you, of course. But why? What's going on? Um... nothing, I'm fine. I was just thinking it'd be nice to have a change of pace. Okay, sure. Well, that's exciting. I could use the company. Makes me wish I'd had another kid. Now, hun, you'll have to pay for an extra bag to bring your vest in. Are you stocked up on all your meds? We could just re-order things once you get here. So you don't have to lug 'em all over. Are you still on Trikafta? Because that's... Yeah, I was just thinking, like, hypothetically. Um, I don't think I would wanna leave LA yet. Sorry. Aww. You know you're always welcome here, sweetheart. Yeah, I know, Mom. Sure he looks like the perfect man, but he could be, like, a serial killer or worse... a scorpio. Only one way to find out though. I'd love it if my bangs could just not look like barcodes. Gross. Hey! - Hey. - Hey. - Oh, whoa, sorry, six feet. - Oh, right, six feet. How are you? I'm good, ya know? I just... Making like a plant and photosynthesizing. Aren't we all? We're all plants. So glad to see that you're a plant guy 'cause I'm a plant girl. - Really? - Yes! Wow, what's your favorite? Oh, um... Just so many, I can't even remember the names. - It's, like, crazy. - I know. The names are hard. I just like the shapes. - The shapes are cool. - Yeah, yeah. - I love your plants. - Thanks! They're super sick. How long have you been doing this? Oh, just from the start of quarantine. No way, I would've thought this was, like, a many years endeavor. - No, no, just started. - Wow. I think they're looking pretty good. I gotta cut a couple in the back but... I wish it weren't a pandemic so I could just ask him out. I guess that's not stopping some people, but I'm not just some people. Yes. Yo, why would anyone ever use a bowl? This is so efficient, and it doesn't dirty any dishes. Bowl, bowl. Should I smoke another bowl? Mm. Spoons are like small shovels. I never thought about that. Where are you going? What would you have to look that nice for? What if she's going to see someone? No. I'm way too high to talk about this right now. I don't want any smoke tonight. Except the weed kind. Hmm. She's been gone a while. Yeah, she's, like, really strict, so... Who the fuck is that? I'm Sean. Hi. Shut up. And get the fuck out of my house. - Terese. - No, keep the mask on! Why are you still here? Get out of my house! Now, please. What the... who was that? Um... Sean. Sean. Sean who? I don't know. I met him... online. You did not go on a Tinder date in a fucking pandemic. You told me to do what I had to do to get over Zack. Oh, my God. I meant, like, drink a bottle of vodka and cry, like egg his house, harass him online, not bring some fucker named Sean into my house! Our house. You're right. I am so sorry. We both live here. You just put us both at risk! For what, stilted conversation and a quick fuck? Amanda, in what world was this okay? We've only talked about, like, wiping things down - and sticking to takeout... - Oh, my God. I thought the "not mingling with strangers" was implicit. He tested negative last week. He tested negative last week? Anything could've happened within that last week, especially if he's going out on random dates during a pandemic! Well, we weren't, like, coughing on each other. Are you a fucking idiot? Are you a fucking idiot?! I know you're from Arizona, but I thought you understood, like, simple science. You're acting like I want to give you COVID or something. You're not trying very hard to prevent it. You can go out and be reckless and irresponsible and probably get away with it scot-free, but if you bring COVID into this house, I could die. A ventilator may have always been part of my future, but if you're going to live here with me, I need you to make sure it doesn't become part of my present. Okay. CF is a lung disease. If I get COVID, I could be done for. This is so serious. I'm sorry. This must be so hard for you. I can't imagine. Well try to. And we need to both quarantine in our rooms until you can get tested. As if I weren't confined enough. Hey. Don't worry. Um, I just wanted to let you know that my test came back negative. That's lucky. Yeah. And for what it's worth, Sean also tested negative. He sent me a screenshot when he asked me out again. Well, have fun with that. I'm not gonna go out with him again. You were right. It was a stupid thing to do. I was just so upset over Zack. But I finally called him, and we had a really good talk. Uh, we're back together. Or still together. But I think I'm gonna start staying there again. Oh, that is so good! I... that... that's so good for you guys. Like, I'm so happy for you guys. - Wow. - Yeah. Um, I think it's for the best. Yeah. I'm sorry I made you feel so unsafe. I don't wanna stress you out anymore. Plus I miss him so much. It is so hard being lonely in these times. Don't I know it. Okay. Uh, I'm gonna go pack. Yes, yeah. Go pack. Go... go pack, girl. - I'm gonna head out. - Okay, cool. - Bye. - Bye. Call me Kevin 'cause this bitch is home alone again.

Yeah, no, what do I watch? Maybe you shouldn't keep binging into eternity, hm? What else is there to do? Uh, you could pick up a hobby. Like crocheting or knitting, like some retiree? Maybe? Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Nope. Binge-watching things is my hobby. No, it's not. It's an avoidance of productivity. How profound of you. I didn't know our therapy session was today. - It's not even Tuesday! - It is Tuesday. So... Okay. You're right. This is why you are my therapist. Why aren't you rising? Maybe I should have asked Sydney before I painted her table. Whatever. It looks sick as fuck now. She's gonna love it. I have been coughing more lately. Makes it kind of hard to deny that I really need to do my treatments. It only takes 30 minutes. I mean, just, you know, do it. Just pick it up and... Bagel Bites. Bagel Bites. Oh, my God. That is amazing. I know he lost, but he's just so cute. And you said you couldn't find a hobby. Yeah, well this one is getting dangerous though because I'm painting, like, anything I can get my hands on: mugs, almost did the wall the other day... Oh, my God, furniture. Uh, your furniture? Okay, so I have a gift for you. Yeah, Terese if that shit doesn't look like it came straight out of a Pier 1 Imports catalogue, your ass is off the lease, so... I'm off the lease. Whoa, are you... are you all right? Yeah, no, I'm good. I just cough when I laugh. Well, that's not normal, is it? I don't know, maybe I'm just, like, coming down with a cold or something. But you don't think that it's...? COVID? Um, I hadn't thought about that. Hello. CF Center, this is Angela. Hi. This is Terese Jackson. Hey, Terese. What can I do for you? Are you feeling all right? Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Well, I... I do have, like, a bit of an increased cough as of recently. Oh, okay. Have you had any fever or headaches associated with it? Um, maybe a few headaches, but no fever. That I know of. Have you lost your sense of taste or smell at all? Any diarrhea? No. Okay, then it's likely not COVID, but you should probably get tested just to be safe. And definitely let us know if you start having any fevers or trouble breathing. Okay. Try to increase your airway clearance... What if I do have COVID? ...and definitely make sure you're staying hydrated. I do have a few of these symptoms. But I don't have it. I'm just being anxious. I've barely been anywhere except the grocery store. I mean, it doesn't hurt to get tested. Better safe than sorry, I guess. God. I did not expect them to touch my brain like that. Oh, I'm fucking exhausted. I guess that's what happens when you stay up till 3:00 a.m. every night. Maybe if I just... close my eyes for a second. What time is it? What? Oh. God. I need to start remembering to wear deodorant more in quarantine. Kind of hard when there's no one around to smell you. Wait. Why am I so sweaty? That's... That's what happens when you break a fever. Okay. No fever, no corona. I'm just being paranoid. Dear God. I don't believe in you, but please don't let me have corona. I just... that would really suck. Um... For me. And for you, and for everyone, really, um... Yeah. Thank you. Oh, shit. I mean, um... Amen. And I hope that you're having a good day. Ow. Fuck. I'm gonna fucking die. Hello. CF Center, this is Jenny. Ugh, not her. She's the worst. Hello? Hi. This is Terese. Um, I was just calling for Angela or anybody else that I can talk to. Oh, everybody's already out for the day. I'm the only one in-clinic. What's going on? Are you feeling all right? Yeah, I just... I think I have COVID. Oh, no. Well, um, have you gotten tested? Yes. Yesterday actually. Good, good. When are you supposed to hear back? Two to five days? Gotcha. Well, definitely let us know when you get that result back. Have you been having any symptoms? Yeah, I had a cough. Um, it was a normal cough. Well, it was a sick cough. And... Today, I had a fever. So... Yeah, you don't sound good. You sound really stuffy. Yeah. That's 'cause I... was just crying a little bit. Oh, honey. I'm sorry to hear that. This must be a lot to deal with. You know, the anxiety alone, I'm sure. We've been exposed to COVID in the hospital, and it's just such a terrible disease. And of course, having a chronic lung disease makes it that much more scary, right? This must be really tough. Thanks for reminding me. So helpful, as always. Terese? Are you still there? Hello? Desperate times call for desperate measures, I guess. Damn, I haven't refilled these in a minute. Haven't needed to. Is there any purpose in wiping these down if I already have COVID? Whatever, I'll just give it the Amanda treatment. Watch it be useless anyway though. My shopper had to have known I was not doing well with this order. Hey! Hey. What are you wearing? Looks like a life vest. Oh, this is my vest. No, this would not help me very much in the water. Your vest? Yeah, like for my treatments. Like my airway clearance. Or whatever. Oh, right, right. I feel like I've never seen you wear that before. Yeah, probably 'cause I wear it in my room when I actually do treatments. Are you okay? Yeah. I just, like, um... I feel like, just, like, I may have COVID. Oh, my God. Um... Uh, why do you think that? I don't know, well, I had that cough, and then I... I spiked a fever, and, um... I've just been feeling really shitty. And, like, I have some other symptoms, so... But you haven't tested positive. Not yet. I took a test two days ago. Uh-huh, and how long till they, um... you get that back? Two to five days. But you can't know it's COVID until you get the results back, right? Yeah, I just... I don't know what else it would be though. - You know? - Right. Well, um, I'm so sorry that you're feeling so shitty and that you're alone. That's so scary. Do you want me to come and take care of you? It's only a three-hour drive. It's really... No. No, it's fine. I wouldn't wanna expose you. Have you told your mom? I just... I don't wanna worry her, and, like, have her calling me like... Terese, you're gonna be fine. Right about now would be a great time for my test results to come back. Well, at least I don't have it that bad. Maybe I got away with a mild case. I've managed to not have a mental breakdown today. I'd like to keep that streak up. There is nothing more infurating than watching young, dumb people flaunt parties and bars on social media in the middle of a fucking plague. I barely go out, and I don't see anyone, but I still somehow got COVID from, like, running errands or something. And these idiots probably won't even get infected because karma is a bitch. And not in the way I want it to be. It's been six days. Where the fuck are those fucking test results? Hello, LA County testing site. - This is Terrence. - Yeah, hi. Um, I got tested on Thursday, and I still haven't gotten my results. Okay, yeah, so we're pretty overwhelmed at the moment. I can't look into anything for you unless it's been seven days. Yeah, I just feel really awful, and I really need to know if I have COVID. Yeah, well, if your symptoms worsen, you should seek professional help and go to an ER if you start... Having trouble breathing. Yeah, thanks, Terrence. Really fucking helpful. I probably should have said that last part in my head. Aww. Poor baby. Are you drunk? No. Gas station sushi. Can I help you? Or do you need... I don't know... do you need more soy sauce, wasabi? I'm not gonna die. I'm not gonna die. I'm not gonna die. I'm not gonna die. I thought if I just lived my life how I wanted to, it would be worth it in the end. I'm not ready for it to be the end. Ow. Okay. Okay, I was only out for two minutes. That's not too bad. Or is it? Oh, fuck. What difference does it make? Hello? Hello. This is Dr. Samuels. I'm on call tonight. What seems to be the issue? Hello, uh, yeah, I think I have COVID. Have you been tested? Uh, yeah, about a week ago. It hasn't come back yet. Um, but I've had a fever and symptoms all week. Um, and I have a really tight pressure on my chest. Um, and my hands are tingly. And I think I just passed out. You think? I did. I did. And you're a CF patient, right? - Yes - Okay. I think we should bring you in to check you out and see if you need to be admitted. We'll be able to test you again for COVID as well as a fall flu panel. But you just passed out, so I wouldn't recommend for you to operate a vehicle right now. Do you have anyone who could bring you to the hospital? Why didn't you tell me? That you were sick? I didn't tell anyone. Well, except Syd. It must be so scary for you. Yeah. It is. That's partially why I didn't tell anyone because everyone telling me how scary it is doesn't make it any less scary. Sorry. It's okay. Why didn't you tell me about Zack right when you got back? Uh... I thought that if I made a big deal out of it, then it would have been real. And also...... we don't talk. We could. Could we? I know I didn't know you that well before I moved in, but you never tried very hard to change that. And then things got so tense when I came back from Zack's. You just... didn't understand. You're right. I didn't un... I don't understand. You've always acted like CF was no big deal. You never actually told me what it was. I'm not good at, like, explaining the science of it. And you're not even from Arizona. Sorry. Sorry about that. Um... I guess I just... I envy how little you have to care about all of this. I know. I wish I could go out and see my friends. Go to restaurants and just... feel invincible like everybody else I know. But I'm not. I've never been invincible. Especially now. Bye. Thanks again. Your oxygen and EKG look good, and your chest x-ray is actually better than the last time you had one. Okay. So I feel fine to send you home. You probably passed out from dehydration. Just keep drinking plenty of fluids. We should have your results tomorrow. Someone from the clinic will call you, and we will go from there. Okay. Thank you. Hello? Hey, Terese. It's Angela from the CF Clinic. How are you doing? Um, I'm all right. I'm tired. Yeah. I heard you had a late night at ATC. That's why I'm calling. Your test results came back! And let me just pull them up here... Let's see. I think it's in here... And you are... negative for COVID! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, so what do I have? What's wrong with me? You did test positive for rhinovirus. Rhinovirus? You had a cold? Yeah. I just had a fucking cold! Just a fucking cold. Worst cold of my life, but, like, it wasn't COVID. Yet. Wait, don't say that! Please. Yeah, I know. I was already taking very few risks, but this has convinced me to be just a complete hermit and never go outside ever again in my life. Ah, good. I'm glad to hear it. 'Cause you can't die before me. Should I tell her I probably will anyway? No. No need to sour the mood. I'll be very kind to her in my will. It's so funny though. The irony in getting another viral illness during a padnemic, Like... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Syd, I coughed, and I didn't die though. I broke the trope. What? Nothing. Never mind. I'll tell you sometime. Dude, where did rhinovirus even come from? Oof. Some guy probably got freaky at the zoo. Back to normal now. Well, as normal as normal is when there's a global pandemic, America isn't containing it, and you're stuck in your house all alone. But it's not a grave.

Hey! Hey, honey. Happy almost birthday! Oh, my gosh. You are so right. That is so soon. Did you forget your own birthday? No! Of course not. Well, do you have any plans? No! It's a pandemic, Mom. Where am I about to go? Ah. Well. Glad to hear you're not going out, but you should do something! You can order a nice Postmates on me. Something you'd consider... bougie? You say bougie in LA, you don't know what you're in for, Mom. But thank you. Anything new, sweetheart? Uh... no. Well, I did have a bit of a cold actually. You don't think it's COVID, do you? Nope. Nope. Made sure of that. I got tested. It came back negative. And I've been feeling a lot better as of recently too, so... Oh, that's a relief! Yeah. Tell me about it. You know, but I've been really good actually. Applying for a job I might actually like. I'm getting it through a friend, so we'll see. Oh, my gosh. Guess what I did. I tried to make bread. I found this recipe online... ♪ Terese ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Ahh. - Yeah! - Happy birthday, Terese! - Nice. - Thank you! I'm just 23. It's not that exciting. Hey, it's your Jordan birthday! - That's right! - Wow. If only I cared about sports. Still, this is kind of, like, anticlimactic. Uh, how much is that edible again? 50 milligrams? 100 maybe? Oh, I should know that. Oh, my God. - I should know that. - Ugh. You could've just said "Fuck it" and gone to some outdoor bar or something. Mm. What a privilege. I wish! I'm good though. Well, you already survived COVID once. None of us would want you to take that chance again. Mm. Yeah, I don't think any of us should be taking those kind of chances. Yeah. That was definitely enough excitement to last me the rest of quarantine. And enough fear for the rest of my life, so... Wait, I thought you didn't end up having COVID. She didn't. She's just hella dramatic. No, I thought I had it! Which means I don't wanna actually get it and go through that again. Hey, that will not happen. Because I refuse to believe the world can be that cruel. Mm. Yeah. Here's hoping. - Cheers! - Happy freakin' birthday! - To the birthday girl! - Whoo! I love you guys. - Let's get it. - But seriously... Check how many milligrams that was. Um, it's too late. I ate all of it. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. She's gone. My body will count 'em and let me know... It's too late to stop it though. But, like, don't get in a car. Where would I go? Get in a car? Where would I go?
