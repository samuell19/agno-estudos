"EXAMPLE OF INTONATION" (Alexander Sokurov's fund) LENFILM A film by Kantemir Balagov CLOSENESS Dad! - Why? - You don't understand Kabardian. - No gloves again? - Did you buy any? I will. - Where are the spark plugs? - Which ones? Malbachov was here yesterday with his Lada-9. It was Shogenov, not Malbachov. Why drink from a glass? We have cups. - Someone never washes them. - What? - And you forgot to book the Lada-7. - Which one? The fat Kabardian guy's black one. Right. Where is he? He'll be here soon. Rebe said he's got a nice job for you. Dad, don't start. Do you want to spend your whole life fixing cars? Here he is. - Hello, dear friend. - Shalom, my friend. - So what did you figure? - Keys... Ila? - Where are they? - On the table. Oh, sorry, got them. Let's go check. Changed the oil. Ila reassembled the gas pump. - Carefully? - Yes. Dad! Let me deal with it. Hurry up, they're waiting for us. My name is Kantemir Balagov. I am a Kabardian. I was born in the town of Nalchik in the North Caucasus region of Russia. This story happened in Nalchik in 1998. Dad... Dad! We're here. Good. What the hell? What are you doing? - Am I still blushing? - No, it's ok. She drives me nuts. She keeps telling everyone... ...that they couldn't find it when they circumcised you. You're my sister, I can show it to you. I saw enough of your morning hard-ons. Sure? I'll prove that Lea got lucky. Enough. I believe you. Lea's a lucky girl. Want to see her earrings? Why keep them? What are you waiting for? You. Let's go. - What? - Get changed, you can't wear that. Be careful! It's good you're here. Wash your hands. Stay, I need your help. Grate the carrots. I'll make eggs. - Can I? - Yes. - What are you doing? - I'm grating. Cut them up fine and peel. - Let me do the eggs. - Cut them into small pieces. - We'll be late if we carry on. - Ok, I see. Where are your dresses? This one's nice. What's wrong? No way, Mom. Put it on! Just look how beautiful it is. - It's your colors. - Mom, I'm not wearing it. Put it on. And fix your hair. - Congratulations. - Thank you for coming. My dear! Lea, my dear, you look gorgeous. David, my sweetheart. It's not too late to say no. Let's go. So happy for you. Congratulations. - Rafa! - Hi. Ila, help Rafa. Where shall I... Back from some carnival? Asshole. Rakhel, two more glasses! Well... We asked you to come because... Let me, Mom. I'll make it short. So, we... I and my Lea. We've decided to get married. Decided to do what? And just in case you think I might change my mind. Thank you. David! Lea! Mazel tov! Did you tell your daughter about the job? - I did. - And what did she say? She doesn't want it. That's how she is. She just wants to fix cars. Let's go? - Where? - Let's go dance. No. I don't want to. What's wrong with you? Why should I be happy? I'm not the bride. Who'd marry you if you're like that? - Go with me. - No. Mom, we're off downtown. I'll see Lea home. - For how long? - I don't know. Don't worry. - It might get cold. - I'll manage. Missing me? - Yes, a lot. Should I come? Well, come if you want. You've got ten minutes. I'll be there before you can say blueberry pie. - Dina, calm down. - Such a sheep she is. - "No money"! - It won't make us broke. It's always been like that: 50-50. When we got married, my family gave half of the money... ...and your family did the same. Dad, Jews should pay like others. Listen to your daughter! I'll fire you! If we raise the price, will they buy it? My stuff's exclusive. - (In Kabardian) How is you? - (In Kabardian) How are you? You Jews are so gentle. - And what are Kabardians like? - Hard. Like rocks. Let's get in the car. - Thanks for such a daughter-in-law. - I'm happy they are together. - Thanks for your help. - No problem. Goodbye. I'll give them a lift. I'll be back soon. Hey, Zalim! - Zalim, what's wrong with you? - Hush. Will you ever bite me again? Are you mad at me? Sorry. Damn! I have to go, it's my night shift. I'll call you later. - See you! - Bye. Mom? What happened? What's this number? Trial. This word holds the entire strength of Jews. The strength that has united us for thousands of years. I am calling upon your memories. A terrible grief has come to our community. Last night our children were kidnapped. David Koft and Lea Harmatz. Such a thing has never happened before. It's a challenge for our community. They told us the price we need to pay. - Let the police deal with it! - We can't! They said it would only get worse. Who cares what they said! I ask you to help the families collect the money. I've got a family! - If they'll take your children? - Mine stay at home. - What does the Torah say? - When my mother died... ...nobody gave a single ruble! I ask everyone to come here and tell me... ...how much they will give to save our children. Berson. Three grand. The money is not enough to get both children back. We have only half. We must decide what to do. Should we split it in half? Would that be right? - What does the Torah say? - Enough about the Torah! It's up to us to decide! I agree that it would be fair to split it in half. But Lea is all I have. I am single. I won't find the remaining money. I am sorry. Give Harmatz all the money they're asking for and to Koft what is left. One gets it all and the other gets nothing? My friend, accept whatever they give you. They'll never agree. Let's figure something out at my place. - What's that? - I don't know, it was here. - Put it there. - Where? - Where you put the VHS players. - They were here all the time. Put it back! You said you could help. Not exactly. I can buy your repair shop for 40 grand. For the building only... ...or also the equipment? For everything. - Then I must have misheard you. - Forty. It's worth more. - I don't know what I'd do with it. - Resell it. Don't upset me. Forty-five. Only because I want to help you. I can't just sell it off. What if no one buys it? Don't exploit us! - You said you could help! - I said we'd figure something out. - Ilana, leave us. - Well said, my friend. - Women don't act like this here. - That's why she passed away. - What are you doing? - Mom, he wants to fuck us over! Get in the car! We agree. And take my goods as well. I'll give it all as I get it. - He'd pay more if you'd shut up! - He wouldn't. - You always shame us! - Again? Enough! - Why are you getting mad? - I must save my son, don't you see? - I do see! - You see nothing! You ran to your "nart" yesterday! Get in the car. Ilana. We'll get him back. You hear me? I do. And then we'll go away. Again? You tell her, I won't. - When will we stop moving? - When it's time. Aren't you tired of it? - I'm not going anywhere. - What did you say? I'm not going anywhere.... Why is everything always about him? Why is he always number one? Ila... They show us we're only guests here. Aren't we guests everywhere? Why is it always the same? As soon as I find my way around, make friends, get a life... - Tell me about it! - Now you're interested? I'll lock you in the trunk and drive away. What else? You won't be with him, he's not from our tribe. Your tribe's showed you its ass! I don't belong to that tribe. Get lost! Why are you here? Everything alright? Can I stay with you? Yes. My pals are coming, let's go. Listen, just in case... ...you are Kabardian, but don't speak Kabardian. That's the girl you kept hidden from us? Let's park. Walking in the desert? It must be hot there. Has it kicked in? It will, don't worry. What are you doing? Zalim! She's pale. She's pale. Tatyana Bulanova. Don't cry We'll have one more night together I'll whisper to you one more time - you are mine Ila! Zhenya, put Muzuraev on. I brought the tape. - Your narts are funny. - You know what "nart" means? Yes. - Some kind of village, a villager. - Nope. - What then? - A hero. There's even a town... "The Town of Heroes" - Nartkala. So you are from there? - Hey. - Good evening. Fill it up. Are you alright? She's fine, go on. It's cold. Yeltsin, go away Cruel battles are waiting ahead Dajjal's squadrons are waiting ahead And the world will be on fire for a long time Oh Allah, everyone will be calling on you We'll set you free, give our souls to God Turn our eyes to Allah, Jerusalem will be ours Mountains of ashes and fire, Your armies will enter the temple So listen to their prayers, Take their souls to eternity Jerusalem, Jerusalem What are they watching? Quick. Answer now. - I left the quarters. - When? Last night. No, guys, it'll be very different this time. If your fathers didn't get it after the Three Hundred Years' War... ...then you will. You'll see that your life is over when you get into your coffin and go to hell. Here are dogs and there are dogs. Raise your head! Lie down. - Why is Russia always at war? - It's not my fault. It's not my fault. Let's talk. Please, don't kill me. I beg you. - Where are the guns? - There. - In the trenches? - Yes. You're lying. We came here from there. Please, don't kill me. On your back! Why are they doing that? Put your hands back. - Wait, brother, wait. - You'll be dead anyway. Let me speak. Please, don't do this. I don't want to die! - I don't want to die! - Good boy. - You're good people! - Good-ish. I want to live. Live forever in pain in the other world. I want to live! Mother! Next. Why didn't the Russian commanders tell the mothers: "It was our fault your boys died. They died... ...and we didn't collect their bodies in time"? We asked you to collect the bodies. Now dogs eat them: noses, ears... Why did nobody have the nerve to tell them? Why send them to Chechnya... ...and then make the Chechen people look like monsters? I'll go fill it up. - Did you bring the tape? - Got it from Zaur. It's not right. - What's not right? - To slaughter people like cattle. They do it alright. Protect their land. We didn't manage it. - Are you serious? - Yes. What if someone comes and demands your house? Or kills your parents? Would you reach for the knife? They won't come to me. Let it go, brother. Are you with borscht-eaters? What the fuck? It's not about him. Chechens are our brothers. If they're brothers, then so are the Balkars. Why don't you say anything? Don't you know about genocide? How does genocide concern you? The Russians left only three of our twelve tribes. - Remember when it happened? - In 1763. Happy now? So why do you live here? Armenians were slain, we were slain, Jews were slain, everyone was slain. I don't give a fuck about Jews! Jews are good to make soap from. Fucking Cherkess! Are you crazy? Let me talk! Calm down! - What are you doing? - He's talking shit! Let's go home. - Ilana! - Dad. In the car! My nart is very handsome, isn't he? Everyone sees it, the best in his tribe. I went to the police. Don't worry, I told them nothing. Maybe I should have... Our David would be cold by now. And I'd be your only child. What a great life we'd live, right? Are you crying? Don't cry. Don't cry. We'll have one more night together. - What did I do yesterday? - You were a mess. I am sorry. - Did my parents pick me up? - Yes. Didn't they give you hell? They're not here. Is everything OK? They didn't look great. - Yes, it's alright. - Sure? It's all good. - OK. Bye. - Bye. Where did you go? Ila, bring me some water. Ila, I... Didn't you see the new spark plugs? Can't find them. I've got nowhere to go, it's strange. No need to go anywhere at all. Dad, let's sell the car. It won't give us enough... But you got me. Well, maybe we should. Listen... You stink of booze. Go take a shower. Dad... Go fix yourself up. Did you tell her? Then I will. - Did you sell the goods? - Yes, I took them to Mosha. - The Rabbi gave us what was left. - Not the dryer. It'll dry fine. Rafa's parents said they'll help with money. - Cool. - Yes. You must marry him. - He knows you decided it without me? - Ilana, they're good people! He'll love and respect you. What else do you need? You figured it all out. I felt something missing from my life. No biggie that I don't love him, right? I'll be fine, right? They're coming today. And you think it's fine? Dad! Dad, please tell me it's not true! We made a decision, dear. You'll be Rafa's wife. - You'll live in a respectable family. - So this is how you let me stay? Ila, get in the house, please. Don't do this to me! Let's think where to find the money! Ilana, don't look at me like that. Nobody else is going to help us. - It's not only because of money. - I'm kind of your daughter! Mine. Dina, let her think. What's up? What happened? What are you doing? Ila... Slow down, what are you doing? Wait, wait, wait... Please, that's enough. Zalim, stop it! What was that? Here's the tea. There you are, finally. Take your jacket off. What's that? I told you she'd be back soon. Good evening, Ilana. I know it's not the best time. We don't really feel comfortable. But Rafa finally made up his mind. And we are fond of you. We came to see if it's mutual. Yes, it's mutual. Soon we'll be one family. We should help each other. Everything is alright. It won't happen. I'll fuck everyone. Let's go. It's up to you to decide. Why do you never say anything? Because it's me who is ashamed. - You said all you wanted? - It wouldn't change a thing. Adina! (in Kabardian) Get the Jew out. Why alone? You wanted the whole family here to meet you? Got a car? Yes. Take me to Lea. Take me there. I'll keep looking for them. He's at Lea's. He asked me to take him there. Got a smoke? - Why don't you sleep? - And you? Don't want to leave? How can you stay here? You've no job. The house is only paid for the month, what then? I'll go to Mosha to work. Rent a dorm room. - The Rabbi's proposal is still valid. - You think so? I can't spend my whole life fixing cars with you. Stay. You've outgrown us. What about you? We're not about to die. I'll sort it with Mom. Why are you here? What do you want? You had us worried. - Hello. - Good day. Go see her, she's restless. It looks better now, right? And I got it for free. What are these boxes for? I'll slice the pie. Are we having a yard sale? David, where do you keep the knives? Where are the knives? - What's going on? - We're moving. Where, downtown? Where else? - Mom, where? - To your aunt in Voronezh. - For how long? - David... Why leave? It's all over. We can't stay! We sold everything. We have no money to pay the rent. - We can open a new repair shop. - We won't be able... - ...to look people in the eyes. - Why? David, we must leave. We leave tomorrow at 9 am. Collect your stuff, please. What about us? Who is "us"? - I have to talk to Lea. - Who said she's going with us? Don't... Let Lea come with us. I can't, I have my mom. You see, she can't. I'm not going anywhere! Sorry, Mom, I'm staying. We saved you, not she. And? You have to go with us. - Have to? - You have to. You shouldn't have saved me, then I wouldn't have to. Is it really so funny? What do you want? I want what's best for you. What's best for me is to stay with Lea. What's best for you is to stay with your family. She is my family. I never cared about myself because of you and Ila. You're just like your sister! I don't need you! You think I'm not tired of never settling? I don't need her either. Let's stay. Why? Because of them? They are just kids. They're no longer ours. They belong to themselves. Let them live as they want. Don't rush it. This liquor needs to be savored. Zalik, there you are! Get out of that car. Your princess is here as well. I'll bring him back in a moment! Me and the lads are having a picnic. Want to come along? Grilled meat, shashlik, cognac. - I don't know. - What? Let's go. Tomorrow? We'll see. What's this "we'll see"? Are you going? I'm not going anywhere. Fine, I need to get home. See you. Let's go, I need a hand. Shall I drive? Will you drive safely? - Got enough money? - Yes. - Sure? - Sure. Take some. Be careful. Mom. Take care. Are you freezing? We'll go when the car warms up. - Are you cold? - Just a little bit. I'll be right back. It's cold. Mom. You have nobody to love anymore. I don't know what happened to these people after that. My heartfelt thanks to my father, Artur Balagov.
