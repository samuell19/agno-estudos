Hey. Hey. Happy belated Valentine's. Good one Alex. Have a good workout. - Hey Theresa. - Hey. What's up with the mask? Oh, I just got back from Hong Kong. Everyone's wearing them 'cause of the outbreak. Outbreak? Coronavirus? Oh yeah, I got a text. I got a text alert about that. I thought it was just in China. We'll see. Hmm, okay, well I was gonna go work out, but it was nice seeing you. You too. Yeah, have a good day. Ideally, you draw up a play, you get yourself a bucket, then you come back defensively and you lock down and get yourself a steal. But that has to be a theme for this team, brother. It's only the first quarter? These guys better wake up or this game is over. There's a nice bounce pass to Gardner, drives and stolen as he goes up. Fast down court, Sanders slides right by Pearson, and goes in for an easy layup. Man, I don't know what they did last night, but they better get their head in the game today. The World Health Organization has announced an official name for the novel coronavirus disease that is causing illness and even death in Wuhan, China. It's called COVID 19. There are many types of human coronaviruses, but COVID 19 is a new disease not previously seen in humans. You risk throwing a split fever here for the pass? That's exactly what I was about to say. You have to be careful with the runner on the third. I knew the air quality in LA was bad, but. It affects people with respiratory problems. Nice to see you too. Gotta go! Bye! See ya. We still don't know if those two games tonight will be played, but what we do know is that NBA officials have said an unidentified player has tested positive for the coronavirus disease, and according to one report, three teammates have also tested positive for coronavirus, and all that is what's led Commissioner Silver to make his announcement today that the NBA season is officially suspended. League officials did not say how long that suspension will last. Yes, COVID is greatly affecting distributor confidence. Orders are down in China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Even our Japanese distributor is indicating that he will be ordering less because of the virus potential impact on Japan. These are products for ischemic stroke, which is an emergent procedure and demand should not go down no matter how this unfolds. That was essentially my response as well, but our Japanese distributor is concerned that his other businesses could be hard hit if elective procedures aren't canceled, but I'm sure that when this dies down in a couple of weeks, they will resume normal ordering. Hmm. Well then for the moment, we'll just have to find a way to cut down on expenses. We are spending a fortune on your apartment in Hong Kong, you practically live there, and they love you there, but until business picks up, I'm very sorry but we will have to suspend your employment. As you said, I'm sure things will return to normal when this all dies down, then we'll be able to hire you back. You gotta admit I've been pretty quiet the last couple of days, right? Sorry to hear that all your sports were canceled. Are you? Really? But it is awfully quiet around here. Yeah, too quiet. Now I know when your boyfriend comes over. What do you mean? You should have sex in your bedroom. Disgusting. Not your living room. See ya. But good to know. Do so by socially distancing themselves from others. A state as large as ours is many parts, but at the end of the day, we're one body. There's a mutuality, and there's a recognition of our interdependence that requires of this moment that we direct a statewide order for people to stay at home. That directive goes into force and effect this evening. We are confident that the people of the state of California will abide by it. They'll do the right thing. They'll meet this moment. They'll step up as they have to protect themselves and to protect broader community and this great state and the world. You know the governor issued to stay at home, right? I got a three on three game later, finals. You? Groceries because that's the only thing we're allowed. You're telling me I can't play basketball?

You know his name? He asks you to say it all the time. Are you practicing for a radio shock gig? And you can hear me all the way from my bedroom? Have you heard it lately? It's kind of like Nebraska.

I bet the first thing that you do is check your Lakers app to check their score. And if they're winning, which usually are, at least I'm in a good mood. Everything's a silly little joke to you, isn't it? But one day you're gonna wake up and realize the joke's on you. Seems like you've given me some thought. Kind of hard not to when you're in my ear 24/7. Binge on the Blacklist, why? Hate to have a little bit of silence? Well, this has been nice. I'll go hang myself now.

No work today? Waitress. No work in the foreseeable future? Thanks for update, Captain Obvious. No auditions? How'd you know I was an actress? I seen that movie on Netflix. Really, which one? Or was it the porn channel? Seriously, it doesn't take that much detective work to know that every waitress in LA is an actress. Why can't you just catch the coronavirus and leave me alone? I mean, what do you do? Sales. Exotic cars, classics. Sales fits you. Really? How so? As I await the insult. You put on some charm first while smiling like a wolf, then you apply pressure, waiting for the perfect moment to pounce. Wow, I'm not quite the stereotype you envision. Enlighten me. See, you love dishing it out, but you hate having it dished back to you. If you're auditioning for a bitch, I'm sure you'll be authentic. That's what my agent keeps telling me. What? Prison got me thinking about a lot of things. Oh, me and your moms were so young. Young? Were you young three years ago when you decided to barge into my mother's apartment drunk? No. You know what? I don't have time for this. I don't ever want you to call me again. Damn. Xavier, I'm talking to you. What, What? Where is the fuck is the toilet paper I asked you to buy last week? I forgot to get it. We are completely out! It is the one thing I asked you to do. Honey, what are you trying to say? I come home after working 24 hours nursing a people back to health to find a dirty apartment, the fridge has no food in it, the dog hasn't been washed, and the bills haven't been paid, and now we have no fucking toilet paper. You know what? I am done. Get the fuck out. What? Get the fuck out! What the fuck is wrong with you? I think COVID has gone to your head. Do I have to do everything? Get the fucking door. God. What? Hey, I'm just your neighbor down the hall. Yeah, I still recognize you with all that on. I was just seeing if you were okay. That is so sweet of you to notice. I come in peace. No, we are fine. You know, we've just been doing a little role reversal since COVID. My husband just doesn't seem to get it. He doesn't need to know our business. I can tell him anything that I want to tell him. Guys, toilet paper. I have extra. Oh, um, I'm so sorry, I am so tired. I know it's okay. I know you're under a lot of pressure and I don't even know how I'm gonna pay my bills without working. Me neither. And I'm unessential. Non. I'm non-essential. And look, if you'll excuse us, I have some work to do. Yeah, man. Do your thing. Have a good one. Bye. Be safe. Here's one I think you'll like, TUI, comes from the Latin word tutelage. Tutelage usually means specialized in individual guidance. Alexander the Great was under the tutelage of the philosopher Aristotle between the ages of 13 and 16, and his tutor inspired him with the love of philosophy, medicine, and science. At 16, he commanded his first army and by his death 16 years later, he had founded the greatest empire ever seen, but it's not so easy to trace the effects of the brilliant tutelage he had received in his youth. Cool. Alex the Great. You trying to tell me something? And Aristotle, didn't he play for the Lakers? Come on. No, no, no, that was Ron Artez. But what's happening with King James anyway? Why don't you just watch baseball reruns or something? Well, ESPN is doing fantasy baseball games, but even I think that's pathetic, but come on, don't change the subject. Why doesn't he ever stay over two nights in a row? Believe it or not Alex, that's none of your business. Your business is located at a one way street, the dead ends. And you know this how? Because he's like every other guy. He's a freaking wolf. He's just better at holding in his inner animal for the first two minutes on your couch. Just the thought of knowing that you can hear us on my couch makes me wanna fumigate. Not everything can be written off with a silly little joke. No, no joke. Like I have to convince you of anything when you're just trying to sabotage my shit. Humor me for one second, okay? And tell me the qualities that are unique only to him. Okay. He's genuine for starters, ever heard of that? And he's sincere, honest, trustworthy. Loyal and obedient? Does he get a biscuit if he brings you your slippers? From what I hear, you two don't talk about anything of importance. Nothing personal, real, safe political opinions followed by safe personal insights. I mean, if one step lesson you could be talking to the freaking mailman. Why not ask him about something real? Like if he's pro-life or pro-choice or try talking to him about taking it to the next level and then see how genuine of a guy he becomes. Okay, and let me guess who you think my perfect boyfriend is. My backstabbing neighbor? Let me flip the question back on you. Are you pro-life or pro-choice? I believe that all women should get to choose what they do with their bodies. Why a bunch of old white men get to decide is beyond me. Careful now, that's awfully close to a thoughtful answer. Do you have a girlfriend? No, let me guess, you don't. I date, not the same girl two nights in a row. Sound familiar? But I do let 'em sleep over once in a while even if I don't want them to. I guess I'm not as honest with my feelings as James. How does someone break a dish loading a dishwasher? Our china is our most expensive wedding gift, and why are you putting our china in the dishwasher in the first place? I broke a plate and you're busting my balls. Oh no, no, no. Those are working just fine. In fact, that is the only thing you seem to do right. Fuck you. Yeah that's not happening anytime soon. Look I am tired of always having to redo everything that you do. It's exhausting. I'm trying, but all you tell me is I'm doing it wrong. Because you are. Look, before this COVID started, I went to work every day and I was respected and now I'm non-essential and I feel that way here and it hurts. Oh shit. Let's not go through that again. Honey. What? This is a dust pan, not a broom shield. Thanks. So do you want me to take the glass outside or can I just throw it in this can? The trash can is perfect. Hey, isn't this book the one you've always wanted to read? For like the last three years. Well, why don't you go sit down and read it and I'll finish cleaning the kitchen. I love you too. Hey Randy. Yeah? You sure make those crutches look sexy. Hey, uh, Xavier? Yeah? Is that a broom or are you just happy to see me? Oh, way! Watch out! What? It's me. We were just making sure everybody here was alive. Yeah. We're just in the middle of something. Yeah, we're working some things out still. Outstanding. We've gotta be quieter. I'm gonna go get the ball gag. Ball gag? Too much information. Talk about getting to know your neighbors. How do you feel about not doing anything tonight? Yeah, that's fine. But did I do something? Like not give you enough sake? I was just wondering if we could talk for a bit. All right, anything. He fidgets, hoping this doesn't take more than a minute to get back to business. How do you feel about me? Huh? I like you. I respect you. I really enjoy our time together, you know what I mean? Then why don't you ever wanna spend the night? I do. You don't. You know I deal with a lot of international companies, so I'm on the phone with Europe at 5:00 AM and by 9:00 AM our time they've already shut down, so I can't sleep in. That doesn't explain weekends. I know, I'm sorry. I was just listening to dumb voices in my head. And now it's time for the wolf to eat his sheep. He's gonna be real gentle in the beginning and real rough at the end just because he had to sort through her female mine fields. Hey you. I'm sorry, do you need another minute to get dressed for dinner? Heck no. Stuck in my apartment. I wanna be comfortable. Unless this bothers you. When did you know that you liked women? I've always known. Isn't it weird that I haven't? That's why you run so hard and hide so much, invisible woman. Why do you keep calling me that? You could simply live in Hong Kong, but then you wouldn't be able to run away from everyone you meet. Meet someone there, you're off to the states, meet someone here and you're off to Hong Kong. Wow. You're hiding, invisible even to yourself. Sorry, life's too short for bullshit, especially with COVID. Yeah. Okay, no bullshit. You wanna know why I keep this place? 'Cause of the way you look at me in the hall. That's because I like you. You don't even know me. You'd be surprised. I got fired. What? Hmm. But that means I'm gonna be spending a little more time in the states finding out what it's like to be visible. Hmm. I can't wait to kiss you. Lead me not into temptation. But deliver us from evil.

I don't suppose I could get a cup of coffee from you. Milk and sugar? Just milk. I got a question for you. Yeah, what's that? Order up. What's your favorite movie of all time? Pride and Prejudice. Really? Let me guess, you love all Jane Austen movies, all types, all versions, all Jane, all men. Yeah, I admit that they have some similarities, similar characters, similar storylines, but I just love the romance, the grandeur. Let me guess. You love ultra graphic films with a couple of bad jokes thrown in. You still enjoy the movies you liked as a child because your taste hasn't changed nor developed. I think that your favorite film is Diehard. Then Gladiator and Bourne Identity definitely make top 10. Top five. Sad. Not as sad as last night. Too soon? Still there? How's the coffee? I wonder why we drink coffee. I mean, why is it so popular, coffee and coffee houses. To me, the expensive kind and the cheap kind all taste the same with a little bit of milk in it. Deep. Do you and James have these personally revealing conversations with each other like this? Yeah, but coffee, coffee. Yeah, I heard it was invented by a sheep herder, found a sheep eating coffee berries. It was all jittery. So we covered movies, we covered coffee. What else? Sports? You into any? Just basketball. - Really? - No! This is nice. What? The silence. Yeah, I'm good. Me too. Careful, that didn't feel mean at all. I'm slipping. As long as you're not tripping 'cause we can't go anywhere. Haha. You funny. I keep having this funny thought that I'm turning into Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie. You're turning into a woman? No, I'm becoming a better man. In my case, talking to a wall. So if this is the better version of you, then I'd be absolutely terrified to meet the old you. Do you wanna come over for dinner tonight? If you don't have any plans, which I know you don't. I mean, we gotta get through this together whether you like it or not. I mean, I can take the hour and try and prove I'm not a cove idiot and you can shoot me down a bunch. That sounds fun, right? I mean, hey, you know, it's nothing formal. I mean, we just have to wear the masks and we can do the whole six feet apart thing. It's not even slightly romantic, yeah? Just two neighbors passing the time doing something a bit different. And let me guess, pizza or Chinese? I guess I am a bit of a stereotype. Mm-hmm. You know, is it even safe to deliver food? I mean, we don't know who's cooking it, who's delivering it, if they're washing their hands, I have a novel idea. Why don't I cook? You know, you won't have to work out as much if you don't have so much to work off. And the bitch is back. You're talking about cooking veggies, right? Like I think I know what those are. - You. - I know, me funny. I gotta go to the store anyway, so I'll pick up some salad stuff while I'm there, and 10 pounds of dressing. - Hey. - Hey. Best sleep of my life. Oh, I'm glad somebody got some sleep. You must be doing it wrong. Which should tell you something. Hang on. Oh, I... I called my brother this morning. You came out to him? I left a message to call me, but I plan to. I'm tired of being invisible. Wow, I'm impressed. Letting your freak flag fly. Hmm. He's going to be shocked. Your family has known for as long as you. What are you talking about? I just found out 12 hours ago. You knew. You admitted it to yourself 12 hours ago. You wanna know something funny? Mhm. If it weren't for the separation and Skype. Yeah? I never could have done what we did last night. Okay. I see that. I mean, this is probably bad to say, but this pandemic saved my life. Thanks to you. Girl, this is probably bad to say, but you should come over here right now. What? Oh, this is crazy. I need to hold you, kiss you, and make you feel as special as you are. I... I don't. Kiss me. On the screen? Computer screens are seven times more dirty than your toilet. Not yours, and especially not yours during coronavirus. I know you, you clean that screen every 10 minutes. Happy? Horrified. Who am I, your mother? Oh, you do not wanna bring up my mother. Hmm. Do something sexy. You are like a dirty old man. Oh, damn, below the belt. Literally. I like you. Yeah?

And I still haven't invited you over. And you have yet to invite me in. You know, I wanted to invite you over before all of this stuff, but I've always been on the road nonstop. Besides you're busy with your family and you're so far away. I drove over here in less than an hour, so I repeat, what's up? I wanted to touch base. I mean, you have no idea how lonely it is when you're single during a stay at home. What's up? I found someone, I met somebody. And I thought you said you were lonely. Well, tell me about him. He's a she. So what, you just got so lonely you figured any port in a storm? I think I've always been in this port. Maybe you've never been in a storm. Well what do you want me to say?

He would probably say something like above all, love each other deeply because love can cover a multitude of sins. Peter 4:8. Not that I sinned. Between the two of us, you were always the saint. I'm the last person that should be throwing stones from my glass house. You look happy. I'm happy for you. Come on. COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID. I love you. I love you too. Put a mask on. COSM. Comes from the Greek word for order. Since the Greeks believe the universe was an orderly place, words in this group usually relate to the universe, so cosmonaut was the word for space traveler from the former Soviet Union, the roots of our own word, astronaut, suggests star traveler instead. Oddly enough, cosmetics comes from the same roots since putting things in order is similar to decorating something such as your face. I have to bite off that. Gimme a book so I can read. I just feel like our vocabulary is so limited, including mine. Hence the book. I mean, look at the songs we listen to, the rhymes and the lyrics are so predictable. I mean, how can someone write meaningful songs if they don't study the meaning of the words? Why listen to rap? Not the dumb shit rap, Drake, Jay-Z, and you can't forget Tupac. I mean, I don't always agree with what they're saying, but at least they're saying something. I don't know, I like music about love. I love your smile. I love your hair. I love the way you walk. There's something about you, but nobody ever explains well that something is. Like your James. Here we go. All he has to do is say I love you, and your heart melts if he ever has. He never has to say why he actually cares, what it is exactly he likes besides your sugar pot. Goin' to school? Glad you changed the subject because it was one word from your last. Yeah, but if you really want to know, Santa Monica Community College. Yeah. I mean, no one in my family had a degree and I'm not looking for sympathy but I came from nothing, less than nothing. Unfortunately, my father wasn't absent. It would've been a lot better if he was, if he disappeared the moment I was born. I'm sorry. Really. I wasn't exactly born on third base either, but I had two parents, do have two parents. Seriously, kind of feel you, like ya even more knowing you had to struggle. Makes me feel like a loser for not trying harder. Time for me to not only improve my fantastic body and buddy career... But time to expand my mind, my spirit, my cosmos. Hmm. Well, I'm gonna give you time to expand on that. I'm gonna go back to my apartment. Good morning. Hey, good morning. Just wake up? Read all night. Did it hurt? Sort of knocked me out. I was reading about black holes in the universe and how they're gonna devour everything in their paths and devour Earth. It got me thinking, if a black hole will eat everything in their path, then at some point they're gonna explode, right? Which means there's gonna be a whole other Big Bang. A new beginning. Oh, yeah, yeah, I was thinking that too. I know that I baffled you with my bullshit. Do you want to try for dinner again? Tonight? As long as it's not King James time, you know? Well, he actually left town during quarantine. His work insisted on it. Outstanding. That's a major bummer. So, same time, same place? Hey stranger. Not glad to see me? No, no, no, I am, I am just surprised. You know, quarantine and all. Since when do you give one shit about quarantine or what anyone says? - Whatcha cooking? - Umm... I didn't know you knew how. I've been learning a lot of new things these days. You turn into a Buddhist monk? Thank God. Company? During quarantine? Probably just the neighbors sharing supplies. Oh hey, hey. Thank you so much. - Yeah. - Hey, I owe you too. I'm so sorry, sorry. Sorry. Cool neighbor. Kind of hot, kind of likes you, but she'll have to wait in line.

I'm starved. You were a beast last night. You weren't so bad yourself. Can we turn down the music? The only thing you ever made for me was a phone call. Your hot neighbor can cook. Hunger is the best recipe. Good sex is the best recipe. Can't hear rap right now. Oh, it's not technically rap. Whatever. I'll get dressed. Okay. First thing you agreed to. I need a new boy toy. You don't get any more of this. See ya. Betty wait. Be safe. Take care. So glad you liked my food. Waited up all night? You wish. I was just giving you time to read your book. Build your vocabulary. Appreciate it, and coincidentally, one of my new words of the day was egomaniacal, which in Latin means selfish prick. I wasn't very selfish last night. I was actually very giving. I imagine when you're giving, you're also taking. As far as I remember you and I are platonic, which comes from the Latin Pluto, meaning we come from different planets, so since this doesn't matter, what do you think? Should we do dinner? Try again tonight? Tempting, but I'll pass. Also you probably got the virus from miss Mademoiselle Betty. I get the feeling that you weren't her first house call. And I think you're gonna get it from James when he comes back from his business trip. Hello Zozo. Nice place. Doing good. Yeah, it's not rocket science, Melvin. It's just a minimum wage job. If I could have held a job, maybe y'all could have held onto my family. It Held your alcohol and held your rage. What do you want? To be a dad? Because when I look at you, all I see is what you took from me and what you gave me. You remember this? You remember all the other ones? I'm worthless piece of shit. Only good I ever done is you. I'll disappear. Not gonna hold you down anymore. Do some good in this world. Proud of you Zozo, proud of you. Melvin. I wanna be able to call you dad. I want to be able to hug you. I want a dad. All right. I'm really trying at it this time, okay? Okay. All right. I think I just figured out how to obtain world peace. Imagine two world leaders sitting down, eating ice cream, and declaring war. Can't fight while you eat ice cream? Simply not possible. You really are a goofball. I guess you just bring it outta me. That's awfully close to kissing words, but at least we have six feet between us. Business trip is over and now he wants to take care of business? Why is this guy taking business meetings anyway? You sure it's safe to see him? Alex, just stop trying to get in my head. Just trying to save your life. ♪ It's clear to see this is a child's game ♪ ♪ I have to keep my distance ♪ ♪ 'Cause you only want the chase ♪ - Hey! - Hey! ♪ You love me more than ♪ How were the meetings? It's almost great, but it's really hard to close the deal without a face to face. Mm. Vis a vis, word of the day. Where'd you go? Vancouver. Canada? So you flew. Yeah. Meaning that you went to LAX twice. You know that you could be a carrier of the virus, meaning that you could infect me and everyone else. I don't have any attempts or any symptoms whatsoever. You know that symptoms may never appear and you can even have the virus and never show any signs of illness. You know that governor issued a stay at home order, so what gives you the right to gallivant? Right? Gallivant? You really have gone stir crazy. Maybe you're right. Maybe I have been cooped in here for far too long, but you would have some empathy if you were doing the same, and besides it's giving me time to think, to rethink things, to think about things for the very first time. Such as us. Yeah. Such as people who just keep spreading this thing with no qualms about it, no responsibility. I think I should go. Really? Okay, well then you should probably take this. So I'm not coming back. I thought we were stronger than that. Can I ask you one random question before you leave? What do you think about abortion? Are you pro-choice or pro-life? What is so funny? I just think it's a random question. You've been attacking me ever since I walked through the door. I'm pro-life. So you're telling me that if I was pregnant, I should have no choice in the matter? That you would want me to keep your baby? You're pregnant? No, no, I'm not, but your concern is really touching James. It truly is. We really know nothing about each other and that's not your fault, but... I think it's time to say goodbye. ♪ When I'm far away is when you take your aim ♪ ♪ 'Cause you and I are a bow and arrow ♪ ♪ Closer I pull you, the further you fly ♪ You okay? ♪ You and I are ♪ Yeah.

Figured I could learn a thing or two. Once you're finished, we can swap. I think you should start with this one first. Hmm. Can I be honest with you? Look, this is gonna sound story book stupid but I don't think I'd be the man I am today without you. You sound like a Jane Austen novel. I guess we should thank COVID-19. How long do you think it'll last? The virus or us? The stay at home. Hopefully as long as possible. In the meantime we can read books together. I just really say that? Now I think that you've been hanging around with me for too long. Yeah. We'll kiss at some point, right? Movie time on the roof! Roof in five! Don't be late! Come on, let's go. Melvin, it's awfully good of you to pay Zoe's rent, and I'm thankful I don't have to hand out another eviction notice. I'm just trying to make up a lost time, brother. Saving Zoe, save myself.

Some of us even speaking for the first time and I am just grateful that when they closed our country down, it only managed to open up our hearts, so welcome to the buildings first movie night! Hopefully the first of many. Since the pandemic has got us all rethinking our goals and our values and our relationships, I hope that you like the movie I picked and find it appropriate. When I come through. What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say the word and I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down. Hey, that's pretty good idea. I'll give you the moon, Mary. I'll take it. The fool flew all the way up here in a blizzard. But in New York. Oh I left right in the middle of it as soon as I got Mary's telegram. Good idea, Ernie.
