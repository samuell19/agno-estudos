Mother f... [GRUNTING] WOMAN: Hello, Agent Wallace. I need your nine-digit security code, please. Hello? Agent Wallace? Agent Wallace? [PHONE BEEPS] Agua la vista, baby. [INAUDIBLE] JIMMY: Hello, my name'’s Jimmy Tong, and I was wondering if there'’s anything I could say that would convince you to have a lunch with me. MITCH: [HIGH-PITCHED] Oh, Jimmy, you'’re so cute. Let'’s go back to your apartment and mate like donkey. JIMMY: You got me nervous again. It'’s just a salesgirl. To you, but, to me, I dream of her before I ever saw her. No, that there! That! Shh. That is the line. Go tell her that. That line. Listen. Hi. My name is Jimmy Tong. When I see you, I have a wet dream. Is that what I say? No, no, you know, just ask her out to lunch now, and later, we work out that line. But hurry up, man. We be wasting time, man. Come on. We have to drive.[SIGHS] MITCH: And whatever you do, do not be yourself. Just joking. [BREATHES DEEPLY] WOMAN: Thank you so much. MAN: You'’re welcome. Goodbye. I can do it. Hi. My name'’s Jimmy Tong. Okay... [EXHALES] Hi. Hi. Pretty colors. Will you excuse me for just one moment? Okay. [SIGHS] Ah... Just between us guys, you don'’t come around here for the art, do you? [SIGHS] Who would? [CHUCKLES] Uh, let me, as owner of this gallery, give you a little bit of friendly advice. Don'’t waste any time. You go over there, and you ask Jennifer out. You think so? Yes. That way, she can say "no," and we can get on with our little lives. Thank you for your advice.Yeah. Hello. My name Jimmy Tong. What can I say to convince you to have lunch with me? [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANS] Oh! I'’m sorry. Are you hurt? I'’m... I didn't... [GRUNTING] [SCREAMS] Come here, you little runt. Ah! Hi. Hello. [GRUNTING] [HORN HONKING] MAN: Get back here! Come here! Where'’d you go? Where are you? [SCREAMING] Sauer... sauerkraut or sauercrop? Sauerkraut? [YELLING] Ow! MITCH: Hey! Hey, wait. What the... Hey! I just washed that car. What the hell wrong with you, boy? Want I jam this in your ass and break it? You want a go? Come down here. Whoa, hey, hey, whoa. Not the face, not the face. [TIRE IRON CLANGS] Hey, I just want to talk. Hey, hey, you do that there, man. You do that... Oh, you'’re scared now. [CLUCKING] Just go and get yourself some training wheels! Go get a tattoo of a chicken! Go! I thought all your people know karate. Not everybody Chinese is Bruce Lee. MITCH: Just calm yourself, Jimmy. Calm yourself. Just not my day. Whoo! Wow. Do you think you can get me to 70 Fleming Street? Of course. Wait a second. [BLOWING] You Jimmy Tong? That'’s who I am. Who are you? WOMAN: The name is Steena. So, how come you drive so fast? JIMMY: More fares. Mmm. Is that why you had your license suspended nine times for speeding? But no accidents. Do you remember where I'’m going? 70 Fleming. Get me there before I finish putting on my makeup, and I'’ll double the meter. You serious? Do I look like I have a sense of humor? Okay. [UPTEMPO MUSIC PLAYING] Hurry, open the gate! Hey, Jimmy! Ho-ho-ho! [IN CHINESE] Lazy ass! Open the gates! [IN CHINESE] I'’m on my coffee break. Shut up, old man! It'’s Jimmy, you fool. [IN CHINESE] Don'’t run over the chickens!

How much do you make at this good job? $475 a week, plus tips. How would you like to make $2,000 a week, plus room and board? When do I show up? Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m. You'’ll be driving Clark Devlin, Mr. Tong. DOORMAN: Good day, miss. Now, you! Out of here! STEENA: Good morning, Mr. Tong. You put your face on without me, huh? Please, have a seat. Those are the house rules. Memorize them. Especially number one. JIMMY: "Never talk directly to Mr. Devlin." If you'’ve any questions, you'’ll find all the answers in there. And if I were you, I'’d get rid of the mildew on the chin. My soul patch? [SNICKERS] Yeah. JIMMY: You like working for this Devlin guy? I don'’t work for him. [DOOR SLAMS] [ENGINE IDLING] I'’m not a professional driver, but I'’d always believed that thing you'’re staring into is designed for the monitoring of traffic, not passengers. Am I wrong? While I'’m really enjoying our time together, shall we try moving? DEVLIN: [ON PHONE] Wallace has been my partner for years. Something'’s happened to him. He wouldn'’t just disappear. Now, you get your job done, and find my partner. MAN: [ON PHONE] So tell me how. DEVLIN: You'’re the head of an intelligence agency. Why don'’t you be intelligent? MAN: I don'’t understand what you'’re talking about. DEVLIN: Why don'’t you call me back when you do understand what I'’m talking about. [SIGHS] [UPBEAT POP MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO] Did we just take the Balsam Road exit? Of course. You have to take the surface street. Sorry. Did you get a copy of the rules? Did you read them? Jimmy, let me tell you something, my friend. I hate the rules. Take Grant Boulevard all the way. The lights are timed. Thank you. [SPEAKING CHINESE] And, Jimmy, crank the music up. Yes, sir. [MUSIC CONTINUES] MAN: Deputy Director Chalmers, ladies, gentlemen, I present to you Special Agent Wallace. Deceased two days, 14 hours, five minutes, approximately. CHALMERS: Pretty interesting. Why don'’t you tell me a little about him? Well, in simplest terms, he drowned in his bathtub. Contusion here suggests he hit his head, fell prone, unconscious. The man infiltrated a Serbian death squad with not even a scratch. [SCOFFS] He goes down in a bathtub? Life'’s a bitch. You want to put him back in the fridge? DEL: He didn'’t drown, sir. He was murdered. Does that make life a little less bitchy? And you would be? That'’s Del Blaine, sir. She'’s having a filter installed between her brain and mouth next week. So, you don'’t think he drowned? Well, sir, there was water in his lungs, but the pulmonary vein was filled with collapsed platelets, indicative of dehydration. He died of thirst. Thirst. And it wasn'’t just city tap water. The mineral profile fit a high-end bottled water, but what was really weird was, it contained a strain of bacteria that I, so far, haven'’t been able to culture. [CHUCKLES] Anyway, uh, didn'’t mean to interrupt. Ooh, the woman seems to know a lot about water. Yeah. She thinks she knows a lot about a lot of things. You know, we have a special situation in the field. I think we could use your talents. You interested? When do I start? You ever hear of Clark Devlin? Rumors and innuendo. STEENA: Del, I could tell you a thing or two about Clark Devlin. Uh, you think we could keep our minds out of the gutter for about a second? Meet me upstairs in an hour. You might just become Clark Devlin'’s next partner. DEVLIN: I'’m gonna need that Gerris marginalis as soon as possible. WOMAN: Yes, my contacts in Guatemala have what you'’re looking for, I'm sure. Good. And, meanwhile, I'’ll take one of these beautiful Uticella marginalis. DEVLIN: Just gorgeous. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Now, you'’re gonna call me? Is your phone number on file? DEVLIN: I'’m having a bit of trouble with the phones for the moment. It might be better if you dropped it off yourself. It may take a while. Well, why don'’t you familiarize yourself with the route. There'’s a little gathering at my house tonight, a fundraiser for the Natural History Museum. I would so love to have you. [MOUTHING] Should I send a car? I drive myself. Admirable. 8 o'’clock. And, uh, be sure not to wear anything too distracting, or no one will get their checkbooks out. [SIGHS] How did you learn to be so smooth? I'’ve seen the way you drive. You have the same instincts I do. You lack confidence. The girl in the art gallery'’s not beyond you, you know. You know about her? Every time we leave the house, we go by the art gallery and slow down. You just need a little polish. I'’ll never be a Clark Devlin. Don'’t tell anyone this, Jimmy, but there'’s a lot less to Clark Devlin than meets the eye. I'’ve got a couple of good lines, and a couple of very expensive suits. Apart from that, we'’re exactly the same. How about a couple hundred million? Trust me. 90% of it is the clothes. The other 10%? The other 10% is in there. You'’ve got plenty of it. Oh. Mr. Devlin, can I ask you a big favor? Yeah? Can I stop wearing my hat? All right. Thank you. No, just stay smooth. Remember, smooth. Thank you. [PHONE BEEPS] Steena, Devlin. This driver, this Jimmy, I like him. Let'’s get him a proper suit. Something sexy. You pick it out. All right. Always a delight talking to you, too, darling. Home, James. Absolutely, Mr. Devlin. [TANGO MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC STOPS] [GRUNTS] Watch your step. Thank you, sir. [HUMMING] [SIGHS] This definitely not a rental. Hello. My name'’s Clark Devlin. Would you like to dance? Would you like to dance? [CHUCKLES] "Admirable." There is just one rule. [GASPS] Never touch my tuxedo. I didn'’t. Good. Don'’t. Yes, sir. Jimmy, get the car. Let'’s go for dinner. Yes, sir. What'’ll you have? It'’s my treat. Anything. All right. Two Whoppers, hold the onion, extra ketchup. Toast the bottom bun only, medium well done. Two large fries, extra well-done. Two chocolate milkshakes, however the chef likes. That'’s it. WOMAN: [ON SPEAKER] Your order'’s ready. Pull forward. That'’s pretty quick. It'’s fast food. Anything else? Yeah. I'’ll have a personal pizza, crispy crust. He doesn'’t eat out much. They don'’t serve pizza at Burger... New item, huh? Do you have a chicken chow mein? Thank you. Jimmy? Yes? It'’s a drive-through. Let'’s drive. Watch out! [BEEPING] Watch it, man! Sorry, pal. Let'’s go. Why are we running away from a skateboard? I think it'’s probably a bomb. [LAUGHS] I thought you said "a bomb." What do you mean, a bomb? [HORNS HONKING] [HORN HONKING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [HORN HONKING] [HONKING] No good. Out! Mr. Devlin! Move! [BEEPING] [BOMB POWERING UP] Jimmy, you okay? I'’m fine. You okay, boss? Yeah. Yeah, [CHUCKLES] all in a day'’s work. Look. Oh, damn. Mr. Devlin. You got any aspirin? Who did this to you? Water Stri... Walter Strider? He'’s the one? Water stri... Walter... Walter Strider. DEVLIN: No, no police. Okay. Uh, I need an ambulance right now. His name is... Trust nobody. JIMMY: Uh, his name is... Brad Dillford. Wear it. Wear... Boss! Boss! [SIRENS WAILING] Hold on, boss. You'’ll be fine. I'’ll take care of you. Wa... Stri... Huh? NURSE: Sir! Oh! Please wait in the waiting room. JIMMY: Okay. I will find Walter Strider. Hey, hey! I'’m sorry. I promise. [SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] MAN: What do you want my mother'’s maiden name for? Last time she was in here, I was born. I'’m sure my dad had something to do with it. At least I hope so. WOMAN: Dr. Angelo? Where is Dr. Angelo? Dr. Angelo. Are you Dr. Angela? Dr. Angela. Dr. Ang... Hey! There'’s no smoking in a hospital. I was nervous. How is he? He might be here a while. You might want to get him some things from home, in case he comes to. Oh. He had this clutched in his hand. I don'’t know if it means anything. [WOMAN ON PA] Orderly with wheels to the front desk. I do need Dr. Angelo. Dr. Angelo... Dr. Angelo is on holiday today. Oh, my God. Yeah. [SEAGULLS CRYING] LUNDEEN: I'’ll tell you, I'’m pretty excited. I mean, nervous, but, uh, I'’m excited. I'’m pumped, you know. I knew I was doing good work for Banning International, but I didn'’t know Mr. Banning would be taking so much notice of me so soon. I'’ll say this though, when I'’m CEO of this place, I won'’t be having my headquarters in the bottom of a boat, you know what I mean? DR. SIMMS: Why did you choose Mr. Lundeen? He questioned my growth projections. [ELEVATOR CLANGING] No, that'’s not it. I don'’t like his hair. LUNDEEN: Mr. Banning. So, word filtered down to me that you don'’t share my optimism about our company'’s future. Oh, no. Actually, I just... Drink? Oh, yes, thank you. I just felt that to meet your projections, pretty much every person on Earth would have to drink only Banning Springs water. Yes, indeed. Water, Mr. Lundeen, comprises 60% of your body. BANNING: Don'’t you find it incredible that two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom can combine to create something so beautiful, so useful, so essential? I find water to be miraculous. BANNING: Do you think I'’m silly? Not at all. [CLEARS THROAT] DR. SIMMS: Feeling thirsty? Yes. [COUGHS] You'’re helping me out by being a guinea pig for a new product. Oh, I see. What a brilliant idea. Water that makes you thirsty. What'’s in it? Salt? [HEART BEATING] There'’s no profundity in salt. Oh, no. Bacteria. Once ingested, its DNA will instruct your cells'’ cytoplasm to spill electrolytes into your bloodstream, causing dehydration. [GROANING] It'’s virulent, but, unfortunately, it'’s too fast. Way too fast. As we speak, your internal organs are shriveling. Ah! BANNING: You'’re becoming as dry as, well, as dry as your limited imagination. Gentlemen, fetch the vacuum, won'’t you? Thank you. JIMMY: "Schiffer, Schwartzkopf, Sondheim, Springsteen..." No Strider. [BLEEPING] Wow. [BEEPS] Huh. [COMPUTERIZED MALE VOICE] Welcome to the Tactical Uniform Experiment. Tuxedo recognizing new user.

[GROANS] [CELL PHONE RINGING] Hello? Are we on? Are we on what? I take my work seriously, Mr. Devlin. So, please stop using that ridiculous accent. What? What accent? DEL: [ON PHONE] All right. You'’re the senior officer. I'’ll play it however you want. Deitrich Banning is holding a meeting with water CEOs. The Agency wants us to find out what he'’s planning. What about Walter Strider? Who is he? I don'’t know. You tell me. Okay. So, we will meet tomorrow, V-15, 10:00. I'’ll be wearing a gray suit. Your code is "nice rack." [LAUGHING] I'’ll respond, "I forgot my bra." That passes for humor around here. JIMMY: 10:00, V-15. What'’s the cross street? Very funny. [CLEARS THROAT] May I join you? Uh, yeah. Nice rack. [PUNCH LANDING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] Hello. Mr. Devlin, there'’s been a change of plans. But I'’m here already. Where are you? Don'’t get all pissy about it. They just told me, so I'’m telling you. We'll meet tonight, 8:00, Pier 17, base of the silo, and forget the password. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Oh, now you tell me. Oh, hey, there he is. Oh, my God, that'’s him. I got to go. The guy in the rain coat. See you tonight. Sorry. WOMAN: Get him! COP: Stop! WOMAN: Get back here, you creep! [EXHALES] So, we'’ve got five minutes to get into position. I secured the rooftop. The equipment'’s good to go, and I just have to say, it is such an honor to be working with the legendary... Clark Devlin? I'’m Del Blaine. [SHAKES HANDS]Have we met before? No. Good. Okay, Del Blaine, let'’s do what we'’ve come here to do. I'’ll follow you. Ladies first. Okay. Couple of details changed from what was in the file. You read it? The files are crap. Uh, give me the short version. Deitrich Banning'’s holding a meeting of international water company CEOs. We think he'’s trying to force them into selling their companies to him. Where are you going? Huh? I'’m thinking. We had Agent Wallace working undercover at his bottled water factory. That is, until last week. Wallace calls us on his cell phone to tell us that the operation had reached critical mass, and, suddenly, wham! Dead. As you requested, a Kleinholz bolt-action 9mm, titanium folding stock with 20-time infrared sniper-scope and counterweighted micro-rifled barrel. [SIGHS] My favorite gun. But I don'’t kill people anymore. Killing? You'’re planting a bug. It was all in that "crap" file. Go look through your binoculars. [BLEEPING] They'’re arriving. Ready? It'’s critical we get a listening device in Banning'’s meeting. [SCOPE BLEEPING] DEL: Range, 962 feet. Aim for the briefcase. Should be a piece of cake for you, sir. [MAN SCREAMING] [SHIP HORN BLARING] You kind of missed. [BLEEPING] In the year 2001, $35 billion worth of bottled water was consumed worldwide. Today, bottled water costs more per gallon than gasoline. We, my friends, are the new oil barons. [BANNING ON RADIO] We, at Banning Springs, have developed a new filtration process that would protect your assets against the biological holocaust that'’s coming. Looks like we got company. CSA would be my bet. You'’ve heard what I have to say. Now I'’d like to hear you. How much is this plan gonna cost us? It won'’t cost you a penny, out of pocket. All I ask is to become your slightly-more- than-equal partner. DEL: Banning says he'’s got the only process to make their water safe. But to use it, they'’ve got to give him half of their companies? He'’s trying to muscle these guys into selling their companies to him. [BLEEPING] DEL: Banning says that their water sources are in danger. Something about everyone being defenseless against four deadly forms of bacteria. [JIMMY GRUNTING] I can barely make out what he'’s saying. Do you want to listen to this? What do you think that means, sir? Del Blaine! Yeah, I'’ll be there in a minute. Yeah, I'’d really like some help up here, sir. Del Blaine! DEL: Do you hear me, sir? I know this is not as exciting as most of your missions, but could you humor me with just a little professionalism? I would really love some help... What are you doing? What'’s with the jumpy-jumpy? Take off your headphones! What? Your headphones! Okay, chapter six of the training manual. Unarmed assailant, frontal attack. Begin! Stomach, head! Stomach, head! [SNARLS] [WHIMPERS] [SCREAMS] God! What'’s my name! Yeah! You okay? Oh! Oh. Where the hell have you been! DEL: Stop pushing! MAN: Ow! My hand! Ahh! [SQUEALING] Yeah! Not bad. Sir? Sir, are you okay, sir? Don'’t let go! Don't! No, no, no, let go! [SCREAMS] DEL: You'’re ripping my sleeve! [SCREAMS] No, no. No, not, not my... Ahh! Sir! My ring. [SCREAMING] Oh, my God! Oh, my... This was not part of the plan. Del Blaine? Del! [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [WHISPERS] [BEEPS] Confidence. Del... [MUTTERING] Moron... Not in the manual. Ugh! Creep! [TIRES SCREECHING] Del Blaine! Stop! [SHRIEKS] Ah! Get off of me! Why didn'’t you stop? What the hell is wrong with you! How do you fall off a building and end up... Oh! [EXHALING SHARPLY] You okay? [BOTH EXHALING SHARPLY] Would you stop that? JIMMY: It'’s okay. DEL: I am in the car with a psychopath. We are not safe. Are you upset? Why would I be upset? I'’ve always wanted to begin and end my career with a big fat failure! Thank you very much, Mr. Devlin. It'’s my first time. I mean, every mission is like my first time. It'’s so difficult being Clark Devlin. Oh. Sorry. [SCREAMS] Ahh! [COUGHING] I didn'’t do that. What is wrong with you! I'’m not who you think I am. Stay away! I'’m a little over-amped myself right now. Let'’s just call it a day. Get some rest and medication. What? We'’ll be in communication.Oh. I don'’t have your phone number! [TIRES SCREECHING] DEL: Who am I kidding? I have no idea what I'’m doing or why I'’m doing it. STEENA: I felt the same way when I took my first field assignment. Then I met Clark Devlin and life just got a whole lot better, and a little more complicated. MAN 1: One sec. Can we get a close... MAN 2: How do we pan... MAN 1: Yeah. Just, uh, hit the second button there. DEL: Everybody warned me he was unorthodox, but he'’s way irrational, bordering on nutso. MAN 1: We'’ll just get, uh... That'’s it. There, yeah. That'’s it, there. MAN 2: Yeah. Look at that. MAN 1: Move it over. Over just a bit. He'’s getting under your skin, isn'’t he? He got under my skin once, and I'’m still feeling it. Yeah, you told me. What about his English? Oh, I can never understand half of what he says, but don'’t you just love his accent? She can'’t hear anything from here, can she? No, I don'’t think s... Whoa! God, I wish I was still back in the field. [COCKS GUN, EXHALES] How do you like me now? She'’s got issues, man. MAN 2: Holy... MAN 1: Can your, uh... Can your girlfriend shoot, uh... MAN 2: A groin out of a target? Let'’s go. Let's get our nails done. Okay. STEENA: Have a nice day, boys. WOMAN: [ON PA] Dr. Angelo, Dr. Angelo... They ran out of "Get well soon." You said to wear this, but I don'’t know. Being a Clark Devlin is not easy. [CELL PHONE RINGS] [LINE RINGING] Hello. DEL: So, Mr. Devlin, how are you feeling today? Not so good, I'’m afraid. DEL: You'’ve got a few hours to pull yourself together. What do you mean? [SIGHS] After the fiasco of planting the bug, I'’d say we have only one choice: Level One surveillance. In other words... Infiltration. Banning'’s gonna be at the Lanford Hotel tonight entertaining three of his partners. Chalmers has agreed to get us at the next table. Is this a black-tie event? No. But I'’m sure you'’ll wear whatever you want. Maybe we can find Walter Strider. Meet you there at 8:00. DEVLIN: Water... strider... What? Water... Mr. Clark Devlin. Strider... What are you doing?

It'’s glorious, wet play. Well, maybe I can come over and play. That would be very nice. The thing is I... I have a small problem trusting people. I don'’t know if I can trust myself with you, Deitrich. Well, maybe we can come up with a way for you to pro... Her name'’s Del Blaine. She'’s CSA. Oh, bloody hell. He drives a BMW, registered to Clark Devlin. You told me you dealt with Devlin with the skateboard bomb. Yeah, well, he looks pretty alive to me. MAN: Pretty good dancer. All over Cheryl. You want me to do something about that? No. Maybe the rancid tart might actually be of some use for once. Get the boys, would you? Whoo! I am so bushed. I'’m sorry, you'll have to excuse me. Unfortunate interruptus. So, my long streak of love, here is the key to the hospitality suite should you feel the need to spend the night. Goodbye. Well, I think I'’ll just go up to room 72, excuse me... 68, and take a long, hot bath in room 7268. Good night. Good night. [CHUCKLES] And once again, we end up with nothing. I can get her to talk. And say what? Oh, Emperor, would you sign my bra? Oops! I'’m not wearing one. [GIGGLES MOCKINGLY] What is it with you and bras? She has information. Oh, right, and that'’s why you have to go up to her hotel room. You have never seen my work. This is what Clark Devlin does best. Can I go home? No, you have to cover me. With what, a shot of penicillin? Huh? Fine. I'’ll be waiting by the pool. Oh, wait. What'’s her room number again? [MIMICS CHERYL] 7268. 7268, 7268, 7268... [SENSUOUS R&amp;B MUSIC PLAYING] [HIGH-PITCHED] Yoo-hoo! Cheryl! CHERYL: Hey, you little devil. What kind of bubbles do you like? Little or big? Hang it for me, will you? Hmm. So, I know you can dance, but what else can you do? Get on the bed. I'’ll show you. [GIGGLES] Oh! Okay, Mr. Devlin, let'’s see your magic. CHERYL: [ON SPEAKER] Oh! Oh, my God, your hands are like a machine. Oh, I am never working with him again. So, tell me about Deitrich'’s good friend, Walter Strider. [MOANING] Oh! Never heard of him, but I know Dry Martini. Maybe someone should mix us a couple. Y-O-U spells "you." [CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLES] Oh. You'’re smart. CHERYL: Really? And a good speller. [LAUGHS] Thanks. I graduated top two-thirds of my sixth grade class. What a gentleman. Look, it'’s Cocktail Barbie. Take your clothes off and stay. I like my clothes on. Kinky boy. Where did you get that pin? CHERYL: Oh, Deitrich. Want to have a closer look? Huh? I'’m sorry. Look at the time. I got to go. Oh, Emperor. [SCREECHES, LAUGHS] Where are you going? Oh, Emperor! What are you doing? [GASPS] [EXCLAIMING] Where are you going, you naughty boy? I adore romance when it'’s rough. [GRUNTING] [BOTH YELLING] [CHOKING] [GRUNTING] [YELLS] Get back here! You'’re dead meat! Come on! [BOTH SCREAMING] [GIGGLING] [PANTING] Take a bath. Oh, yes, because I'’ve been a dirty, dirty girl. [KISSES] Go fill the tub. Do you like it with bubbles? Hot bubbles. Oh, yippee! [SCREECHING] [HIGH-PITCHED] Yippee! Go![SCREAMS EXCITEDLY] [CHERYL SINGING] ♪ Tiny bubbles in my wine ♪ Makes me feel fine ♪ Come on, her voice reminds me of my mother. CHERYL: Is that room service? [GRUNTING] What'’s happening? CHERYL: What'’s going on under those cute little boxers of yours? Yah! Oh! CHERYL: Emperor, the bubbles are perfect. Come to mama, Emperor! Coming! Oh! DEL: Help! [DEL SHRIEKS] [GASPS] MAN: Say good night, agent! Del Blaine. Del Blaine. [MAN SCREAMING] Sorry. CHERYL: Emperor! This is not what I signed up for! She'’s in there taking a bath. What happened to your nose? [GASPING] Sorry! Honeymooners. Yes, some things never change. Ooh. Emperor! Emperor, come back! Please! [DOOR JARRING] Huh? Ooh. Go! Get going. DEL: Ouch! Can'’t you do anything? Why are you so mad? Oh, gee, let me think. Because big, ugly men are trying to kill me? Because I got stuck with a millionaire playboy dilettante for a partner? You don'’t care how you make people feel. I happen to be an extremely sensitive person. [GROANS] Okay, you think you know feelings. Look at me. How do I feel? Sick. Sad. What about now? Constipated. Creepy. Horny. [LAUGHS] Is funny. Is angry. Haa! Is crazy. You know nothing. This is why you don'’t have a boyfriend. No wonder you didn'’t get anything from Banning. Oh. Right, I didn'’t get anything from Banning, except where his friggin'’ lab is. Where? Let'’s see if the great master agent can figure it out. Banning said he sometimes has trouble sleeping. Big secret. All men have trouble sleeping. Sometimes, at night, he goes down and works in his lab. He sleeps in his lab? He sleeps in his bedroom. His lab'’s in his bedroom? No. Get your facts straight. His lab is at his house, his casa, where he lives, get it? Excellent. You passed the test. I put in a good word with the boss. Just you and me. You know, if you'’re so good at this, why don'’t you tell me something about me. Okay. You have big crush on me, and I know your name is Del Blaine. First of all, you wish, and my real name is Delilah. Delilah? Suits you. Hey... Hmm? [MOANING] Oh, Emperor! JIMMY: Hey! Oh, God, Clark, isn'’t anything sacred? Ow! Rug burns are so sexy! It'’s the driver. [LAUGHS] Thank you. Invitations? Oh, yes. Why don'’t you offer him 5 bucks? I have them somewhere. Nice party, huh? [CHUCKLES] DEL: So, you'’re the strong, silent type. That'’s the whole bouncer package. [BEEPING] DEL: I didn'’t mean your package. Thank you, Dr. Schwartz. Shalom. Come, darling. Product launch, my ass. Let'’s go find Banning's lab. [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] ♪ In the music In the music ♪ In the music In the music Let'’s go. ♪ In the music In the music ♪ In the music ♪ In the music In the music ♪ In the music In the music ♪ DEL: Are you trying to get me alone? Where'’d they go? Don'’t tell me the great Clark Devlin can'’t come up with an answer. Although, he can walk on water. It'’s a trick, right? [MACHINERY WHIRRING] Come on. Wow! Mr. Devlin likes insects, too. DEL: What? Oh. I mean, sometimes I speak of myself in the third person. Hmm. Del Blaine thinks you'’re a freak. DR. SIMMS: Have you cleaned the tanks? JIMMY: What are they doing down there? DEL: I don'’t know. When you'’re done here, you can go and sweep the tunnels. Don'’t use the blower! I can tell the difference, and don'’t touch the tequila for me and Mr. Banning. [CHUCKLES] Whatever you say there, Dr. Simms. Yes, Dr. Simms. DR. SIMMS: Louder! BOTH: Yes, Dr. Simms. We better hope the little ones follow the queen. If they don'’t, the stock is gonna be worthless. Follow the queen? Huh? Have you seen Cheryl? Maybe he'’s gay. Cheryl? No. MAN: Man, let'’s get out of here. Let'’s go have a smoke. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hey. How did you... Ugh. Whatever. JIMMY: Look at this. [AIR HISSING] [BLEEPING] He'’s pinpointed the national reservoirs. JIMMY: He'’s going to poison the water? Not with that stuff. It'’s too detectable, and there'’s government safeguards. Let'’s check out the computer. Now, you'’re thinking. [DEVICE BLEEPING] Who are they? They shouldn'’t be in the lab. Let'’s go. Oh, my God. Oh, your God what? DEL: DNA recombinant microbes carrying a T-4 genome. English. Genetically induced hydrogen-oxygen barrier. Normal person'’s English. DEL: Dehydrating water. Drink it, you'’ll shrivel up and die. But the big question is, how is he possibly gonna introduce it into the water supply? [DOOR OPENING] I think we better go. Quick, over there, by the wall. Nobody here. Let'’s check the hatchery. DEL: You'’re on my foot. What was that about? Shh. Go! How did they miss us? What, are they blind? Don'’t look up my skirt. [R&amp;B MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Absolutely. ♪ Baby, you send me ♪ Set adrift on memory bliss of you ♪ The camera pans the cocktail glass ♪ Behind a blind of plastic plants ♪ I found the lady with the fat diamond ring ♪ Then, you know I can'’t remember a damn thing ♪ Banning'’s got the bacteria, but has to transport it from his lab to the water. There'’s no way he can. Maybe with airplanes. Not possible. Besides, even if he could get it to a reservoir undetected, an alarm would trigger the second the surface of the water is broken. You'’re really smart. It'’s an act. I'm an inexperienced girl who'’s trying to bluff her way through. You are? Come on, stop humoring me. Just be honest. Honest? All right. You think I'’m the great Clark Devlin. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Yeah, hello? Steena, I can'’t talk right now. Yeah. Yeah, I can handle it. Bad news? Can we go somewhere and be alone? Sure. I didn'’t know you were so strong. Take off your clothes. Let'’s not do anything we'’ll regret. Take off your clothes. What'’s happening? I knew the second I met you you weren'’t Clark Devlin. Now, take off the tuxedo, it doesn'’t belong to you. I wanted to tell you, but I just didn'’t know how. Take off your clothes. [TOILET FLUSHING] What is that? Hey! You, out here! Whoa! Okay. Take the clothes. Okay. Slow down. My name is Jimmy Tong. I'’m Mr. Devlin's driver. He asked me to find Walter Strider. I don'’t want to hear any more of your lies. Give me the watch and the shoes. Where'’s Clark Devlin? How'’d you think you were gonna get away with this? Things happened. I decided to go with the flow. [CHUCKLES] What about the underwear? They'’re mine. I mean, my roommate. Jimmy. Suits you. These are my roommate'’s, too. Go finish your business. Excuse me. Have you seen the Emperor? No. Impolite to leave without saying goodbye to the host. I was just looking for Deitrich. I'’ll take you to him. [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] Like a big terrier with a little rat. I think she was down in the lab. Well, at least your interest in water was genuine. Look, I'’m here because of you. You wanted to know if I could be trusted? I bet this tux is just your size. Thank you. [BLEEPING] We got a positive location on Blaine, sir. MAN: [ON RADIO] How long till we get to her? Twenty minutes. I'’ve transmitted the coordinates. JIMMY: Dear Mr. Devlin, I did the best I could, but it wasn'’t good enough. I did not find Walter Strider for you. I also lost your tuxedo. I'’m sure you will get it back. I guess I will go back to being what I was before I met you. Water strider. Water strider. Water strider! Stupid! BANNING: My beautiful little darlings. DEL: Gerris maginatus. Species native to Southeast Asia. Commonly known as the water strider. Walter Strider. Yes, the water strider. Very good. Very good. Well, it'’s brilliant. They touch down on the reservoirs. Their little feet transfer deadly bacteria without breaking the surface of the water, so no alarms sound, and it looks like a nasty little trick of nature. Fortunately, there is one drinkable water source. [MOCK GASPS] Yours. [LAUGHING] Deitrich, you'’re a genius. Too bad it won'’t work. Oh! You so wrong. Wrong! Wrong! Wrong. It will work because my plan is perfect. Sorry, Mr. Banning, it'’s your plan, and mine, and it'’s ours. Shut up. Explain. Oh. Alrighty. The life cycle of the Gerris maginatus begins with mating, something Dr. Simms is not personally familiar with. Anyhoo, the insects swarm to fresh water, where fertilized eggs are then deposited on the underside of lotus leaves and hatch into larvae. Yes. Spare me the Discovery Channel blather. [SNICKERING] Tell me why it won'’t work. Yes, tell us. Why it won'’t work? This is the northern hemisphere, correct? You incubated insects native to the southern hemisphere. So, simply, it is too cold for them to mature sexually, much like Simms here. Therefore, they won'’t mate. Therefore, they won'’t seek out water. Is this true? No. I knew a girl once, in college, quite well. Very well. And then you remember cousin Doris? No, Simms, the bugs. The bugs. Oh! You'’re not gonna believe this hoochie, are you, Mr. Banning? Oh, yeah? Ask him if I lied about the tuxedo. This tuxedo is... It'’s all right. It's... All right? That is the most incredible piece of technology on the planet. And I am laying it in your big, hot hands. Mr. Banning, release the bugs. Go ahead. Do what he tells you. You might have a chance at second prize at a junior high science fair, but you can forget your dreams of world domination. Slip into it, Deitrich. See how it feels. DEVLIN: The other 10% is in there. You'’ve got plenty of it. Hey, Dr. Schwartz. Tell your boss Clark Devlin is back. [GUNS COCKING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [SIGHS] Drapes nicely. [BLEEPING] Well, it certainly puts a spring in one'’s step. Happy to have lightened your loafers, Deitrich. One question: why are you doing this? [ALARM BLARING] Hey, what the hell is this? This is the moment where 50 CSA commandos storm in, take you, your pretentious accent, your jackass sideburns to the Federal pen where, guess what? All they serve is highly chlorinated tap water. Presenting Clark Devlin. [GROANING] Have I told you how amazing you look in this tuxedo? [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] Ugh. Simms, prepare for release. With pleasure, sir. [COMPUTERIZED FEMALE VOICE] Hatchery doors opening. Water sources targeted. Pods will begin releasing striders in five minutes. [BLEEPING] Maturation level 85%. [GROANS] Why are you here? I'’ve come to save you. That'’s great. What about the big guys with the big guns? [GASPS] [GROANS] For years, I'’ve heard about you. Now we finally meet, I find that the great Clark Devlin is nothing more than an ordinary man who'’s about to die an extraordinary death. You'’re right, except for one thing. My name'’s Tong. James Tong. Whoa! [MUFFLED SCREAMING] You okay? Uh, Jimmy, is there something you want to tell me? Later. Oh. You'’ve got a good suit as well. [GRUNTS] All right! [GROANS] Let go! [SCREAMS] [YELLS] [SCREAMING] [BLOWS] [GRUNTS] Ahh! [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] [FEMALE VOICE] X-4 genome bacteria-induced water striders 100% mature. Bacteria drop sites identified. Pods now opening. What are you doing? No! No! She'’s ruining everything. [FEMALE VOICE] Electrical malfunction. Hatchery doors disengaged. Ah! I knew girls like you in high school. Yeah? Did they do this? Mmm-hmm. They did. DR. SIMMS: Mr. Banning, you must open the hatch manually. Sod off. [FEMALE VOICE] Manual hatch release required. Manual hatch release required. [GRUNTING] Rotate valve counterclockwise to open hatch. [GRUNTING] BANNING: Get off. Bloody open! [FEMALE VOICE] Manual procedure complete. Hatchery doors opening. [GRUNTS] Airborne striders awaiting queen release. [HOUSE MUSIC PLAYS] [FEMALE VOICE] Hatchery doors opening. Clark! I mean, Jimmy, help me! I'’m busy. [BANNING SCREAMS] [FEMALE VOICE] All mature striders ready for release. Bacteria-laced microbes fully activated. [CHOKING] His head'’s about to explode. Look at him. Look at him! You might know a few tricks, but you'’re just a sad, pathetic man. [SCREAMS] Smoking is bad for your health. You okay? Yeah, duh. By the way, nice going. Now millions of people are gonna die of dehydration. You left the hatch open. JIMMY: They'’re not flying away. Yeah, what are they waiting for? They are waiting to follow the queen. [FEMALE VOICE] Airborne striders awaiting queen release. DEL: Oh, my God. For once, you'’re right. The queen is gonna lead the striders to freshwater sites all over North America. Quick, grab it before it'’s released. [FEMALE VOICE] Queen strider disengaged. Alert! Queen strider disengaged. [ALARM BLARING] Let'’s go. MAN: He'’s got the queen! Oh! [DEL SHRIEKING] [YELPS] You dropped it. [BUZZING] [WHIMPERS] Don'’t move! Ah! Ooh! [EXCLAIMING] [MUFFLED SCREAM] [GIGGLING] [BUZZING] Ow. [NECK CRACKS] [SCREAMING] [GAGGING] [LOUD BUZZING] DEL: Sir, excuse me, I deserve to see this. Ugh. [ALARM BLARING] Trouble. Okay, okay, make hustle, ladies. Let'’s go. Let's go. Watch out, Aqua Lung. Oh! Oh! Hey, pal, nice suit. It'’s okay, kitten. Everything'’s gonna be all right. It'’s not okay. You just decked the hero. I'’m a genius, and I can testify for a piece of immunity. Also, I'’m from a neutral country... Shut it. Well, looks like we got here just in time. Oh, to what? Take credit? Oh, you'’re hilarious, Blaine. Winton Chalmers, CSA. I spearheaded the operation that took down Deitrich Banning. I bet you'’re Jimmy Tong. Here'’s your tuxedo. You happy now? I will be when I get it safely back to headquarters. By the way, Blaine, not a bad job for your first time in the field. Well, I didn'’t do it alone. She always says nice things about me. You finally do something right, you deserve the credit. Well, sir, it'’s an honor to help the United States of America. I feel exactly the same way, soldier. Don'’t think you're gonna be able to get away with a bureaucratic pat on the butt, do you? Well, I'’m hoping to. [LAUGHING] [SCREAMS] Ooh! Man down, people. [GASPING] Well, there is one thing you can do for me. And that would be? STEENA: All right, tracking systems locked on. Anybody screws up, and your ass is mine. Block off this end of the street. MAN: Roger that. T minus 30 and counting. Is everyone in position? MAN: [ON RADIO] Manhole agent up. STEENA: Flower lady, hot dog vendor, go. Replace hot dog vendor. Come on, hustle. Let'’s go.

Target locked. Jimmy, what do you say? The name'’s Tong. James Tong. I'’m the man. I'’m the man. STEENA: Del, did you tell him to say that? DEL: No. Well, sort of. STEENA: Oh, God. DEVLIN: Come on, ladies, relax. He'’s just pumping out pheromones. STEENA: Clark, Shut up. DEVLIN: I do believe I'’m in charge of this operation. STEENA: The package is locked on target. Why did you wear those pants? DEVLIN: He'’s stopping. DEL: What'’s he stopping for? DEVLIN: Use the door, Jimmy. MAN 1: He'’s breathing heavy. MAN 2: Have you seen her? MAN: He'’s out of his league, if you know what l mean. [MEN LAUGHING] DEVLIN: A hunter. MAN: It'’s the gallery owner. STEENA: Quiet. DEL: Nice. STEENA: Clark, please, would you focus? He'’s about to speak. Open your mouth. Hi. Hi. That'’s the girl? She'’s not that pretty. STEENA: Jimmy, smile, come on. DEVLIN: Move on to something else, quick. He doesn'’t look so good. He doesn'’t look so good. He doesn'’t look so good. He, doesn'’t look so good. Clark, give him a line. Steena, shut up. DEVLIN: Just look deep into her eyes... DEL: Clark, no. MAN: He looks like he'’s hyperventilating. Don'’t listen to them. Listen to me. I can'’t think with you screaming in my ear. STEENA: Everybody calm down. Not you, her. No, no, her, her. Look deep into her eyes, and tell her you had a dream about her last night. Clark, be quiet. Del, will you shut up? Uh... I hate to say this, Jimmy, but don'’t take advice from women about women. DEL: Shut up. The voice is screaming in my ear. Hey, if you can hear me, wipe that look off your face. Remember me? Hooters. Soul patch. Okay, I'’m gonna have to ask you to leave. I'’m the love of my life... DEVLIN: No, no! No, no! You'’re the love of my life. DEVLIN: Never tell them you love them, Jimmy. Can you have dinner with me? Get out. Pretty sure he crapped his pants, people. JIMMY: I just want to have dinner. Get out, now. JIMMY: Lunch? Now! Oh! STEENA: All right, we'’re terminating this mission. Pack it up and roll home. I think I blew it, Mr. Devlin. Jimmy, I wrote the book on this stuff. Trust me. You didn'’t blow it. You outgrew her. Maybe. DEVLIN: Tell you what. Take the weekend off. First thing Monday morning, we'’ll head somewhere with interesting prospects. How about Monte Carlo? Sounds good. Thanks, Mr. Devlin. Thanks, everybody. MAN: It'’s okay, Jimmy. MAN 2: There'’s a lot of fish, Jimmy. Hang in there, buddy. MAN: Next time. Well, if you were trying to get her to notice you, mission accomplished. What are you planning for the second date? Running at her with a knife? It'’s difficult for me. What is so hard? You just have to say something like, "Excuse me, you want to go get some coffee?" When I around beautiful women, I can'’t talk. Sure. Beautiful women. You know, a real knockout. Like the beautiful lady in the gallery. Thank you. Thank you very much. What'’s wrong? Nothing. What? You can'’t tell how I feel? You look sad. No. Sick? No. Constipated? No. A little. Tell me, what'’s wrong? It'’s just, no guy would ever do anything for me like what you did for her. Or tried to do. You know why? Because you are a pain in the butt. Yeah, nice working with you, too. Hello. Delilah, excuse me. You want to have a coffee? I only drink organic green tea. Eh! Wrong answer.
