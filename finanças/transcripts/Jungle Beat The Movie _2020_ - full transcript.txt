A-ha! Huh? Hmm? Ooh! Whoa! Ah, man, there's none left for me. What was that? Talking? I can't talk! Words? Ouch. Ouch? What is an "ouch"? A word. What's a word? This. This is a word. I'm talking! I'm talking! I can talk! This is amazing! Oooh, nice word. Amazing. Ah-may-zing! I think that's my favourite word so far. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Wait! Now it's sounding weird. Amazing. Is that right? Doesn't sound right. Ama... Ooh, tree. Ooh, I love you, tree. Stone. Leaf. Branch. Ground. Foot. Root. Vine. Hands. Fingers. Tail. Nose. Elbow. That's a good word. Amazing's better. - Excuse me. - Talking elephant! - Where? - You! - What? - Talking elephant! Me, talking? Talking elephant! I can talk? Thank you for the bananas earlier. They were delicious. I can make compliments. What's going on? I don't know, but isn't it great? Or, as I like to say, cos I can say stuff now, amazing? Have we been able to talk this whole time? That would've saved a lot of grunting and pointing. - Like, a lot! - Shh! What? - You hear that? - What? - What is it? - Shh. What? - What do you hear? - That bush is crying. - I'm not a bush. - Talking bush! I said, I'm not a bush. - Shrub, then? Talking shrub? - No. - Hedge? - No! Fruticumque viret? I can speak Latin! What's Latin? OK, we're sorry. What are you then? I can't tell you. You'll freak out. - No. - We really won't. You sound all alone and sad. Is this your, uh... I feel like this would be your shoulder, or... Whoops. Oh, please come out. It's nice out here. We've got, um, uh, oh... the sky and, oh, the ground. OK. Can't stay in this fruticumque viret forever, I suppose. As much as I'd like to. Told you you'd freak out. What? No... So, why were you crying? Is it because you're, like, really super freaky? What did I say? - Is it, though? - No. It's just... Have you heard of the word "alien"? We hadn't heard any words until, like, five minutes ago. Well, you see, - I come from very far away. - The sky? - All I want is to go home. - Oh, that's easy! What? Hey, no! - What did you do that for? - You said you wanted to go home. Yeah. OK. It takes a lot more than that - to exit the Earth's atmosphere. - Gotcha! - I have the regret... - No. - He seemed nice. - I wonder what he... What's tha... Um, look, I don't mean to cause a fuss. - Would you mind not doing that? - Sorry. Hey, we can talk again. You're making us talk! It's not me. Hang on, just... Where's that...? Ah, there we go. If you're anywhere near this, then... - What is that? - It's a speech pod. Oh, I love peaches! Not peach. Ssp-p-p... speech. - This makes us talk? - Yes. - Could I have...? - This is amazing! - That's my favourite word. - Nice. The others have got to try this! Oh, boy. Just wait till I get my paws on you. You'll wish you'd never ripened! Huh? Get off my lawn! Get off! Off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off, off! Huh! And, you! Get off my back, you yellow-bellied delicious tropical tormentor! Who's there? - Egg. - Egg who? No. Just Egg. Why? Is there other stuff out there - I don't know about? - Who knows? - I want out! - Uh-uh-uh. Not yet, dears. Too soon for you. Ball. Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball, ball, ball. Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball. Huh? Ball? Come on. Say something. Just a word. Huh? - Huh? - Oh. Hey? Oh, coming. I'm coming. I'm sorry. No, that's quite all right. I'm used to this sort of thing. Huh?! Hey, who are you? What are you? What are you doing here? You're a newcomer. - Do you know the rules? - Rules? When you're in this jungle, you need to know the rules. Rule 1: stay off my lawn! Rule 3: don't ever, ever... What happened to rule 2? ...ever correct me! Rule 4: I'm right, you're wrong. Rule next... You don't need to tell me this. I'm trying to go home. - Huh? - He's from the sky. Well, no... a bit further than that. I come from... Please don't throw me again. I come from a planet called Scaldron. It's another world far beyond the stars. Oooh! Ooh. But I'm not allowed to go back until I complete my mission. A mission! That sounds A to the may to the zing! Favourite word. I'm allowed to do stuff like that to it. What's your mission? I'd rather not talk about it. - But we can help! - Yeah. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm not helping anyone unless there's something in it for me. Honestly, you don't have to help. Ah, no, no, no. Nice try. You can't leave me out of this! I'm helping and that's final! It's something I have to do myself. So, if it's all the same to you, I'd really rather be alone. You're still there, aren't you? You look like you could use some company. It's very lonely, being alone. We'll stay with you until you feel better. I don't need help. I'm a Scaldronian. - Scaldronians don't need help! - Loud words! - That's upsetting me. - Sorry, I didn't mean to shout. Don't worry, he's always upset. I am always upset! Don't you say I am. - What? - You see? - I have no idea what you mean. - Exactly! What I mean to say is it's very kind, thank you, but you can't help me, and you wouldn't even like it if you did. But if you don't complete your mission... You can't go home. And if you can't go home, you won't... See your family. Poor alien. Can't go back home. Oh, come now. There, there. Chin up. But you can't go home, and it's so far away. And we can't help you. And what about your friends? - Oh, that's not a problem. - Huh? I don't have any friends. Look, it's not... Oh, boy. Please don't cry. OK, fine. I'll do it. I'll give it a go. - Your mission? - Yep. Why not? If it'll stop all the, you know... ...stuff. Yes! OK. Well, I guess this is it, then. The, um, moment. I... Uh, hang on. Hold on a sec. Let me just, uh... Yeah, that makes sense, yeah. OK. Yeah. Hm... OK then, sorry about that. Uh... I claim this planet in the name of the mighty people of... - Hey! - Mmm. Oh, great. Freedom! Look out, coming through! Terribly sorry. - Come back here, young lady. - Ah, man. - Carry on. - Yeah, go on. But... he took my... Don't worry about that. You can do it. Right, guys? You can do anything you set your mind to. - I set my mind to freedom. - Not you. - Oh. - Uh-oh. Uh... Um... Uh... I claim this planet... ...in the name of the mighty people of Scaldron! Surrender peacefully or meet the wrath... Is it wrath, wrath...? ...the wrath of the mighty people of Scaldron! Uh, that's... that's a bit repetitive. Should probably rewrite that. And, uh... Um, there, there you have it. That's my big, uh... The end. - We surrender peacefully! - You... You do? Wait just one second. I for one do not surrender peacefully. - You really don't have to... - I surrender peacefully. - You did it! - I did? Yeah, well done! Whoopee. I did it. I... I conquered a planet. Huh? Hmm! Huh? So, now what? Um... Right. Well, usually, when a planet is conquered, um, there's like pandemonium and chaos all around. Uh, so I guess, as your new leader, my first job would be to bring, uh... ...peace. Here's our chance. - Yeah! - Let's go! I don't know what we're doing, but I'm excited! Now, guys, remember, peace. - Yeah! - Oh, dear. Oh! Not so fun, is it? You're not very good at this, are you? Time to run away! What? As ruler of this planet, I order you to... - Why did you do that? - I saved your life. Why? You have to be alive to get home. Well, yes, but... Somehow it feels like now is not the best time to be having this conversation. Whoa! Boost! Bo-o-ost! Rhino power! Huh? Hey. Wait. No, d... no, don't! I'm terribly sorry about all of this. Oh, this? This is pretty normal around here. Normal? You call this normal? Look here, Jelly Boy. I do have a name. I'm Fneep. What's your name? Ah, humph! Humph, huh? Pleased to meet you, Humph. - Humph? - Oh, my turn! - I want a name. - Uh, OK. Um, well, you've got a trunk, and... Trunk! I love it! Oh, uh, wow. Um, OK then. Not quite where I was going, but, yeah. - Hi, my name is Trunk. - Yes... Hello! Trunk here. Hey, there. Trunk. - Oh! Me! Me! Do me next. - Fluffy Bum! - Fluffy Bum! - No, that can't be your name. - Banana Breath. - Ooh, I do like bananas. - No! - Ear Face. - Ear Face? - Nose Boy. - No! - Munkiii... - Yes, Munki. - I wasn't finished. Munki. - Pleased to meet you, Munki. - And I'm Trunk, by the way. Yes, Trunk, pleased to meet you too. And what about you? My name is Rockford Haberdashery Pleasant the Third. But you can call me Rocky. Ball! Ball, ball, ball, ball... Get away from me, you great galoot! Now your mission is done, how do we get you home? Ah, well... you see, my, uh... my spaceship, it, um... yeah, it's quite far away, and it might be, uh... just a teensy bit crashed. So it doesn't exactly fly any more. - But then you can't go home. - And... No, no, but, but wait. It may not fly, but now that I've conquered the planet, I'm allowed to use the homing beacon and they'll pick me up. They have to come anyway to, uh, um... well, to see this lovely planet that I've conquered, obviously. Well, let's go to your ship. - Yeah! - It's a long walk, I'm afraid. Long walk? I'm out! - You don't have to come. - Oh, I'm coming! - Why are you always so grumpy? - Exactly. Let's get going and get this over with. - Actually, it's this way. - No, it's not, it's this way. Huh? What the...? Hmm! Huh? What? Hm? Oh! Hm-hm. Ah! ♪ Scaldron, Scaldron ♪ Most terrifying planet in the universe ♪ We're all really mean and we're very, very strong ♪ We take what we want and you can't stop us ♪ So there, so there, so there ♪ So there, so there, so there ♪ So there, so there, so... - ♪ There, so there - Yeah. Yeah. - That's a great song. - Yeah. A little bit treasonous, but... What's Scaldron like? You have mangoes there? No. But we do have giant flaming death tarantulas. How about pears? Most of the tarantulas were eaten by doom snakes. Pineapples? And the snakes were dissolved by acidic slime wolves. Oh. Bananas? - Oh yeah, huge bananas. - Sounds amazing. Huh? Hm... This is great. It's like a backing track for our triumphant new leader. Leader? There's only one leader around here. And it is me. No, Fneep's the leader. Aren't you, Fneep? Well, yeah. Yeah. Yes, I am. I mean, I gave a speech and everything. It was very good. I even, well, for a moment at least, pointed my... you know, G-U-N. A gnu? You pointed a gnu? What does that even mean? - No, that's not... - Look, speech or no speech, pointing gnu or no pointing gnu, you are not the leader. - Am too. - Ooh! "Am too." That's a good one. I didn't see that coming. - Try saying "Are not" again. - Brilliant. Yeah, OK, OK. Are not. Am too. Double repeat. He went with the double repeat. He's good. Oh, wait, wait, wait. I know. Why? Because. Curse your freakishly wily retorts! Try to stick your tongue out and go... - Like this? Aah.. - No, no, no. It's more closed, like this. Aah... Just tighten your lips and blow. Oh, I got it! Where are you going? - Back to my ship. - Stop him! Huh?! Huh? That is very disconcerting! Oh. Um... Sorry. Pardon me. Coming through. Oops. Let me just... Sorry about... You're all surprisingly OK with the fact that you can suddenly talk and sing. Why is that? Before this all you really did was eat grass and stam... Stop! Don't say that word. What, stam...? How about stam... ...poodle? Stam... ...pickle! ♪ Scaldron, Scaldron Stam... ...papaloola! ♪ We take what we want and you can't stop us ♪ So there, so there, so there Oh, but that's... that's just wrong. Oh, give me a sec. - Words are one thing. - And oozing... Walking through legs is another. But you do not have the singing voice of a leader. And everyone knows the best singer... ♪ Is always the leader! And that is me-e-e-e-e! Oh... The second-best singer is always the leader. And that's me. I can do the squiggly bits. And, I can go... - Hm! - ♪ All the way up he-e-ere! You need to go high to be leader, do you? Is this high enough? - Or how about this? - Huh? Oh, that's very good. - I didn't know it could do that! - That doesn't count. - We're all high-pitched. - I can go high. I'm the leader. No, me. I'm the leader. Leader, leader, leader... Oh, who am I? I'm the leader. Look. Oh, uh, hang on a sec, let me just... I'm the leader. I am. - What happened? - Oh, man! Look, you're great at what you do. Right, guys? It's not because you can sing high that others follow you. It's because you love what you do. I do love singing. They love singing with you because you love it. Not because you say you can do it, or tell them to do it, because you just do it. I concede, you're a better singer than me. - That's true. - But I did conquer the planet. So, I'd really like to keep moving along now. Of course. Aw. That makes me all warm and fuzzy on the inside. I'm warm and fuzzy on the outside. Feel. Hey, Trunk, watch this. Stam... ...potato. Stam... ...paloney-macaroni. I wanna try. Stam... ...pede! Stampede! Did I do it wrong? Yee-ha! Oh, boy, I sure love it when a stampede gets going. Nothing that anyone can say can stop it. We just charge and charge right through everything, destroying everything in our path. Nothing gets in our way, yes, sirree! See? Told you. Stampe-e-ede. You know, you did great back there. Yeah. That was very leader-y of you. Hey, wait up. I wanna come too. No! No! No! No! No! No, no, please, no! So, where are we going? Thank goodness. Hey, it's OK. It wasn't your fault. I'm a bird! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes! Check these out. Whoo-hoo. I can fly! Awesome! Oh! Thank goodness you're OK. Again! I wanna go again! I wanna fly! Oh, Baby. We're ostriches. We live on the ground. Hm. I'm not convinced. Whoo-hoo! - Whoa! - Oh, baby, you can't fly. You're kidding. Then what are these for? I think they're for this. - Fneep, you OK? - Can I get back to my ship, now? Yeah, yeah, sure thing. Lead the way. Come on, young lady. It's back to the nest for you. Can I try again? If I was a bit higher, I'd have enough forward thrust and the air-pressure differential would be able to generate sufficient lift to be able to fly. I'm not letting you out of my sight again. - Come along. - Oh, man. Stampede. Yee-haw! Huh? Huh? Huh? You OK? What happened back there? Why was she squeezing her? - Huh? - The mother one. Why was she squeezing the baby one? Squeezing? Oh, that's called a hug. You don't have hugs where you're from? What's it for? It's to make you feel better. To say, "I love you." To let you know you're not alone. To let you know you're special. I can't believe you don't have hugs where you're from. How do you say "I love you"? Well, we don't. What? How do you ever feel special? The only way to do that is to conquer planets. That shows you're strong and worthy of respect. The more planets, the more respect, and the more special you feel. Or so I've heard. Sounds like pretty hard work to feel special. But you haven't conquered any planets until this one. You don't need to remind me. Has no one ever told you you're special before? Hu-u-u-ug! No, that's quite all right. Hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug! It doesn't matter to us that you haven't conquered lots of planets. - Yeah. - Hug, hug, hug, hug, hug. Get back! Please, just don't, OK? Hug? Huh? Huh? What's that? I didn't have breakfast this morning. Sometimes there just aren't enough bananas to go around! Oh, somebody get him something to eat quick! Running. Oh, they're coming this way! - Running! - Climb up quick! Come on. Grab on. You'll be safe up here. I can't. It's against the rules to be safe. Incoming! Come on! I'm trying to help you. Why do you keep trying to help? I'm a Scaldronian. Scaldronians never ask for help. Never! Well, monkeys always help. Always! And elephants! Get up here! OK. We're backing up, backing up. What are you doing? I won't leave you alone down here. Guys, you're gonna get smooshed! - Get back up! - Not without you! - Why won't you just let me be? - Because we're your friends! Smooshing imminent! So, just to confirm, I'm still the lead singer, right? Yes, you are. Great. Glad that's settled. Why didn't you climb on board? Did you not hear about the smooshing? I can't keep taking your help. You don't understand what it is to have your planet conquered. Uh, nope! But we do understand something about home. You're not supposed to want to help me get home! - You're not supposed to like me. - But we were just trying to... Help. I know. I wish you wouldn't. You're making this much harder for me than it should be. I really wish you'd leave me alone now and stop trying to be so nice to me. He seems a bit down. He's never had a, you know, H-U-G before. What's a hgu? Rolling, rolling, rolling... Rolling? Huh! I can talk again. Whoa! Dizzy. I like it. What? No, I don't. You like it. Who said that? What? OK, I'm talking, so I must be close to the others. Wait until I find you, give you a piece of my mind. Not just one piece. I'll give you three. Tell you what, let's make it four. Do I hear five? Huh? Oh! Shiny. Oh. Oh! Nyah! Oh... That's the shiniest thing I've ever seen. I want to touch it. I want to taste it. No! It's a bad idea! Definitely a bad idea. And yet, somehow I... No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Ah! Aa-a-ah! Fneep, report on your current status immediately. Fneep, it has been two Earth months since your last report. Feedback immediately. How much longer is it going to be, Fneep? The transporters are ready. Once you have conquered the planet, we initiate the removal of the Earth creatures. Report back immediately! Take us away? I must warn the others. I gotta... You're still there, aren't you? Oh. It's very lonely being alone. We'll stay with you until you feel better. Uh, is this...? What's, what's going... I didn't quite follow that at all. Um... It's just close to our bedtime. When the sun sets, we go to sleep. Sunset. It's... It's... We don't get sunsets on Scaldron. Not since we set the atmosphere on fire. You should see a sunrise. It's amazing. Huh? Hm. - I say. - How wonderful. - Amazing. - So beautiful. Behold Fneep's star! He has conquered a planet, and become a Scaldronian hero! Fneep! Fneep's so awesome, amazing and not insignificant. He's not a disappointment. I love that he's shorter and smaller than the rest of us! Yes, Fneep, your Earthling captives will make fine specimens in the Great Hall of Conquest. Oh! Oh! Aah! Hm-mm! Hmm! Oh! Hmm! Hmm? Uh-uh. Hmm. Ohhh. Huh? Ha! Huh? Huh. Brilliant. Fneep, it has been two Earth months since your last report. Feed back immediately. How much longer is it...? No much longer, that's how much. Because I've done it. Conquered a planet. Didn't see that coming, did you? Oooh, Fneep can't do any... Fneep can't do... Fneep can't do... Oh, come on. Can't I do anything? Homing beacon. Homing beacon. Planet Conquering Manual, Third Edition. Let's see. Hm... A-ha! Homing beacon. "Caution." "Using the homing beacon before you have conquered your planet will bring you great shame." Ah, brilliant. OK. "If you really want to use the homing beacon, turn to page 107." 107. "Step one: ask yourself if you really want to use the homing beacon." Yes, I really want to use the homing beacon. "Step two: repeat step one just to be sure." Oh, come on! Huh? Huh?! Huh? Aah! Ooh! Ooooh! "Step 59: if you haven't conquered your planet yet, then using the homing beacon will not only bring shame to you but also sully the great name of the mighty Scaldronian people, who will be very angry." No surprises there then. "Think deeply about that for a bit... ...then proceed to step 60." "Step 60: to activate..." Ooh, here we go then. "To activate the homing beacon, press the big red button." That's it? That... Nothing else? Just press the... Sixty points! Sixty points to tell me to press a button? Sixty points to tell me to push a button! OK. Oof. OK. OK, fine. Yeah, that's... OK. Here we go. OK. So, Fneep, you've finally done it, have you? Conquered a planet. I didn't think you had it in you. Huh? There he is. Huh?! We can speak again. And there's another one. Shh! Where are the Earth creatures, Fneep? The transporters are ready to take them away. - Take us away? - You see? - You knew about this? - Yes! Why didn't you tell us? Fneep, why haven't you launched your star yet? This is no time to be bashful. Launch your star to prove that you've conquered this planet so we can gather your captives and take them to Scaldron. I have launched 999 stars to declare the planets I have conquered so far. This will be your first. Well, get on with it, Fneep. What are you waiting for? Oi. Fneep? Fneep. Did you or did you not conquer this planet? I did... ...not. I... I lied. My ship was broken, and I needed you to collect me. What is he doing? You brought me here for a rescue mission? I... I thought, seeing as you're my father, you might come and... Watch you fail again? I am Grogon the Conqueror, not Nogorg the Loiterer! When you called me, I was conquering a nebula. Do you know how hard that is? They're mainly gas! And what kind of Scaldronian asks for help? - Didn't you read step one? - Yes. And did you read it again just to be sure? We can't let that big blue bully talk to him like that! Well, seeing as we're here... Huh? ...I might as well get my thousandth victory! I'll conquer the planet and capture its inhabitants myself. No, Dad, you can't. You don't tell me what I can or cannot do. I'm the can or cannot do teller. You... You don't understand. These creatures... These creatures are more powerful than you can imagine. Not more powerful than this. They eat those and shoot them out of their mouths. But it's new. And there's one that's just a fury-ball of razor-sharp spikes. Another possesses the power to suck the life right out of you - without even touching you. - I don't do that. Do I? And one's an unstoppable force, a giant creature with a horn on its face. - On its face? - Yes. Able to crush anything in its path! Another one so furry and with a tail so... - Furry? And a tail? - Yes! That does what? Uh, nothing really, actually. He's not so scary. But the others... Come to think of it, this piddly planet isn't really worth my time. You know this means you won't be going home again? It's straight on to the next planet for you to fail to conquer. Yes. Why is Fneep doing this? To protect us. I'm doing this for your own good, Fneep. It's the only way to stop you being so weedy and useless. Attention all hands. Gather in the main atrium for Fneep shaming. - Rubbish. - So insignificant. - Such a disappointment. - So much shorter and smaller than the rest of us. I had money on you doing this, boy. Prepare for launch initiation. Set sights for... Where should it be? The Endless Bogs of Scorpulus? The Stench World of Gamma Six? The Flame Fields of... Dennis. Or the Un-Planet of Quadrant Elty-Two? Where is it you would like to go, Fneep? Home. What was that? Hey? Pod breach, level one. I said, he'd like to go home! What is this? It's not safe for you here. Ha! I laugh in the face of not safeness. Oh, Fneep, is that the fury-ball of spikes? Really? That little thing? Coochy, coochy, coochy. Huh! A-ha! Aah! Oh! A-ha! Me likey spikey. - We said we'd help you get home. - That's what we're going to do. The only way Fneep is going home is when he's conquered a planet and that's never... He has conquered one! This one! - Haven't you, Fneep? - No, he didn't. He said he lied about conquering it. I... lied about lying? - You did conquer it? - Uh, yes. And we're his captives. Is that true? Um, I, uh... guess so. But... He can release us if he wants to. Can't you? Well, yes, I guess I can. No, you can't! We're Scaldronians! Scaldronians don't just release captives. That's the opposite of what Scaldronians do. It's my planet. I can do what I like with it. It's not your planet yet, Fneep. I don't see your star in the sky. And if your star isn't in the sky, the planet remains open. I think perhaps I'll conquer it myself after all. Surrender to me or... Be careful. It's new. Don't you know it's rude to point? I didn't know it was rude to point. I'd point all day long. I'd point at you and you and you and you and you and you... What is this thing anyway? Be careful, Trunk, don't press... ...that. Trunk! Huh?! Oh! Huh?! Whoopsy, Fneep. Lost your star? Never mind, I have mine right here. We wouldn't want this planet to go unclaimed now, would we? Hey, what the...? That's right. Furry and with a tail. Oh, dear! Uh-oh. Whoa! Gotcha! Huh?! Huh? Hey. Wait. Leave me alone. Hey, get your hands off my friend! I mean, uh... Friend? You were gonna say friend. No. I mean, uh... Rule number six: never finish a word - that I'm beginning to finish. - Frie-e-end! Oh... I've gotta launch my star. Now, where did I...? Oh. Ooh, look at this. - I wonder what it does. - Let me see. I wanna... Oh, who am I kidding? It looks like some sort of egg. Egg? This nest ain't big enough... Whoa! It's OK, Mama. You don't need to cheer me up. It's OK that I can't fly. I'm just going to... crawl around on the ground like a little worm. - Trunk. - Fneep's star thingy! This is Fneep's star thingy, the things he needs to shoot into the sky to save us! Um, I'm not sure if I understand you, dear. Or that. I know you're here somewhere! Hm? What? Huh? Oh! Ha-ha! - Huh?! - Ha-ha as well! Here I am! Now I'm here. Trunk! - Munki? - Fneep needs his star! - I know. - What's going on? - Munki's flying. - Oh, sure, Munki's flying. Not that I care. I get to crawl in the depths of despair and disappointment for the rest of my life. Whoopee. If Fneep doesn't get that star, - we're doomed! - Yes... The future of the world is in your hands. - I got that! - No pressure. But really, it's kind of a big de-e-e-eal! Shoot it up there. Oh. It'll bounce off the ship. I need someone to take it. Me! Me, me, me, me, me! I can take it! No chance, young lady. You're gonna stay... Right here for the rest of my life, never doing anything? - No, that's not...! - Mama, I can do this. I've been waiting my whole life for this. - You hatched yesterday. - Shh! How can I let Trunk shoot you up there? - What if she misses? - Ahem. Hm! Hm! Pistachios. Surely it's not that important that... Once again, it's really, really important that Fneep gets that star! Whether I like it or not, you were not born to stay in this nest. And whether I understand it or not, you were born for the sky. Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Thank you! Just hold on to this thing. I'll get you to Fneep. Yes, sir, ma'am, sir! I'm gonna fly, Mama. Yes, you are, dear. Yes, you are. Wow. Oh, no! Hold on! Whoa! Whoa! Enough! You know, now seems like a good time for an intimidating speech. Something to put the fear of Scaldron into you. Something to really let you know how badly you've lost. Let me see. Stampede. What? What is it? - Stampede. - Stampede? What? Furry... and with a tail! - Stampede! - No! No! No! No! - I'm Grogon the... - Stampe-e-e-ede. Special delivery for Fneep. Hah! Huh! Oh, uh... Hey-hey, chaps. Ever read point 65, sub-section 12 of the user manual? - Huh? - Hm... About how to distract someone so they don't see what's coming? Huh? Uh-oh! Oh! Oh! Flying! Huh?! Fneep! Have you ever read point 65, sub-section 12 of the user manual? Yeah, about how to distract someone while... - Oh, dear. - Never fails. Oh, no! That's the wrong colour. There it is, Fneep. One thousand planets. - No. - What do you mean, no? Your star may be in the sky but you've not conquered the animals yet. Ha! Judging by this lot, that'll be easy. You may think so, but they have a secret weapon. A-ha! Of course! Our secret... weapon? What's our secret weapon? Something more powerful than anything I've ever witnessed. - More powerful than... - Yes! More powerful than the Power Bolt of Gustagoriopia! - Even more powerful than... - Yes! Even more powerful than the Blinding Eye of Mezmorio! - More... - Yes! - Mo... - Yes! Yes! And here it is. What is it? Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! It's a hug. You're my father, and I love you. What's happening? Don't worry, you'll be OK. What are you doing to me? I'm making you feel special. - That's it. - Huh? What? What are you looking at? You've never had a hug before. Hugs! Who needs hugs? Stupid, soft, mooshy. Wh-Wh-What are you doing? That's why you're always so grumpy. Nonsense! What are you doing? Oh, you know you want one. Step away from the hedgehog! All along you just needed... OK, let me just... Ha! You see. No touchy, no huggy the spiky man. - I... I feel... - Warm and fuzzy? - Yes. - Special? Yes! You must all feel this! Ground, ground, ground, ground... Oh! Ground, ground, ground... See? I told you I could fly! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! It's all yours. I can't do this. This planet belongs to all of you, not me. Yeah, but I wanna see some fireworks! OK. But I'm doing it my way. - Say "Fneep!" - You don't tell me what to say. - You don't have to. - I'll say it. I'll say the heck out of it! Fffne-e-e-ep! Ah, was I blinking? I think I blinked. - Oh! - Way to go! - I am so proud of you. - Thanks, guys. Come here. I couldn't have done it without you, you know. Time to go home, son. Aren't we going to get your thousandth planet? But of course. I have just the planet in mind, and you can help me conquer it. - Scaldron. - Our planet? Yes, I have a new secret weapon, which I think our own people could use. Hug. Hug, hug, hugging. I can never repay you all properly, but... here, you can have this. - Peach! - No! - Hm. - I'm going to miss you. - No, I'm not! - What? - Exactly! - Right. Yeah. Baby Ostrich already has her present. Whee! Kids. And Rocky. Flying! And you, my furry friend, you've done so much for me. What can I do for you?
