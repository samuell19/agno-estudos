They say it came from the North... like the icy wind that sweeps the plains of the great prairie. TEX AND THE LORD OF THE DEEP Tex Willer... From the far off Silver Mountain... to the azure waters of the river his name was pronounced with fear. Death rode alongside him... ready to seize any person who violates the law of the white man. But his spirit ran free, beyond all boundaries. So the Indian people learned to know... and respect him, and named him Night Eagle. Then came the day when he combined his blood... with the warrior blood of the Navajos. And after a few moons, his brow bore the symbol of leadership... the sacred wampum. The story is unclear in the legend... lost in time between myth and reality. Let me tell you his story... and the adventures that made him immortal! Oh, no ... Poor Naatani ... Whoever is guilty of this cruelty, must sweat blood ... before they can rest in the depths of hell! There were two horses and a wagon. I am certain they are headed for the high pastures. You bury him, I'll Go back and warn Gray Wolf. What dirty apes these men are, Marty. All they know is how to drink ... Christ! Don't even think about it, you bastard! Fuera! Quick! You are poking your nose in Tex Willer, you're going to regret it ... You seem to forget... I warned you about selling whisky to my Indians The great ranger does not shoot an unarmed man. A snake is never unarmed. Now you can sell whiskey in hell! Night Eagle! A man comes this way... Silver hair! Kit Carson ... What does the old devil want? I do not know why, but when I feel the smell of that cigar ... I smell trouble! And in big trouble, judging the face of our friend. I took a shot! My back is broken and a stomach, which kicks ... dreaming of beer, fries and three inch thick steaks! But after three hard days riding ... this is precisely the kind of reception I expected from guys like you! Come, have a cup of coffee ... and try to water down some of that poison you carry inside your gut. Then tell us. I need more than coffee to cure me. If you remain dry it bites! Only the Major knows where I am ... Did he send you, how is the old buzzard? That old buzzard, as you call him... was wondering if you enjoy living up here with the Navajos ... have you forgot you used to be a ranger. For more than two months we did not hear from you. I understand how he feels. If he sent you to fetch me ... it means that he's got one big hot potato on his plate. and no intention of getting his fingers burnt. Anyway... Do you remember the matter of that large load of guns ... which got rustled down by the Mexican border a few months ago? Sure. And if I remember correctly, Ted Murphy was good ... He was in charge of the mission. Yeah. the first consignment of rifles... were escorted by Ted. Three hundred new rifles bound for Fort Davis... but instead, vanished into thin air ... But how is it possible? Ted was convinced that among the Presidio warehouse workers... there was an informant in cahoots with the gang of raiders. The location of the chariots was very secret. Evidently not... I know that area. It's a maze of canyons, two weeks ride from here ... if we have good horses. Yes, but cutting through the desert ... you can save several days of travel. Tiger ... inform Gray Wolf that we will be away from the village ... for some time. and get some supplies. Thank you. And I am certain that Major Dolan will be very grateful. You know him, he is a good man but stubborn as a mule. But he can be a bloody nuisance. Well it takes one to know one Three days I 'm gonna have to unnecessarily chew dust ... Maybe they followed the track dell'Alamito River to the west. And in this case ... Tiger's signal! They were surprised in their sleep. There are the tracks of those cowards. Poor wretch! They burned him alive, those bastards! Strange. Look his clothes. It seems that the fire has not even touched them. And 'as if he were ... mummified! And Ted's watch. I recognize it. Let us trace and track those bastards. Come and see! Look what I found. What's that? It has all the appearance of an Indian fetish. Perhaps some Indian tribes of Mexico. Only the Indians of the Hot earth work on stone that way. Mexico ... I fear that we must say goodbye to those guns ... The weapons left from the garrison, right? Yes, when the army set up their new depot We had best ride over there and talk to the sheriff. Groom them properly and give them a double ration of oats! Do not worry, treat them as if they were angels. Much obliged. Thanks. And where's that totem you we?re talking about? Yeah. And our ... good luck charm. could I get a closer look at it? Yes, of course! Pablito, the Yaqui Indian who works for Bedford ... has one just like this. For the record Jim Bedford is ... the man who contracted arms transportation for the army? Yes, exactly. Why do you ask? Because in addition to the recent robbery ... Mr. Bedford has suffered another dozen burglaries in the latter months. And always theft loads of weapons. Easy there Willer, We are talking about one of the... most prominent men of the city. Then it will be a pleasure to make his acquaintance. While we look for him ... Sheriff, please show Tiger... where we can find a good bed for the night. And a saloon where they serve three inch thick steaks... with mountains of French fries! Ok. - Let me take that. - Oh, thank you. Tiger! Please. Mr. Bedford. Dude, tell him that the Rangers ... Tex Willer and Kit Carson want to see ... and talk about the robbery of the convoy to Fort Davis. - Talkative fella aint he ... - Rangers Willer and Carson ... asking for you. Rangers, eh? Take a seat. I am very surprised. I did not expect the army would so such an interest in this case. The disappearance of three hundred guns... is not such a trivial matter, Mr. Bedford. not to mention the other thefts you have suffered recently. True, Willer. Sit down, please. Sam! These men are thirsty, get them something to drink, quick. So, gentlemen.... What do you want to know? First of all ... have you any idea who may be responsible for the robbery? A goddamn bunch of desperadoes, I think. They always manage to hide their tracks ... and once crossed the border, sell off the weapons someplace. And where is that place? Hell, I hope. The last consignments were not insured. I have to agree that you are a rather unfortunate merchant... You ever seen this before? No, never seen it. Very strange. I was told that Pablito, The Indian who works for you, has one just like it. That's total nonsense! Who told you this? I do not like your attitude, Willer. what exactly do you want to know? One simple question. Those so called robberies of weapons ... how much you have earned, Mr. Bedford? Have you lost your mind? Get out of my sight! I don't want to see you again, you bastard! And Ted Murphy What about him, huh? I asked you a question, idiot. Get up! Think, Tex. don't do it? The stench of a his corpse I recognize from a distance! Tex, look out! Drop the gun! Bastard! A real den of snakes ... And here's another one. Next, walk! Look, look, who's ... Yeah. the one who does not like to talk ... - No. - ...I'll tickle him with my 45. No, don't shoot. I will tell you everything you want to know! But you must promise me to send me away from here ... What are you afraid of? If they know I have spoken, I will end up dead... Look! Oh my days! Adios, rangers! Vamos! Come on! - What happened? - I wish I knew. Come on! hurry! Come on! Move! Come on! Go! The sands of death will take care of you! The shot came from down there! Tex! Look out! it's quicksand! Tex! Hurry, Carson! Damn! That was close! And 'crazy! Wait! Do not move! I will try to leap forward! Hold on, Tex., do not give up! I was mad ... Come on! More poisonous than a scorpion, Yaqui based! A couple of mine have recognized him as he fled. - It was Pablito. - Where is Tiger? With Warton, the village doctor. They are trying to understand what was the cause ... for the terrible death of that poor fellow. It feels like stone. Give me the lens. Scalpels, Tom. Incredible! Beer I cannot believe it. It seems like a centuries-old mummy! If I remember correctly, they said he was shot in the right arm. - It 'true, Tom? - Yes, Doctor. This hole should correspond to the wound. Pass me the scissors. right, I?ll try an in scission here, after that, God help us. It 'absolutely impossible to make on an autopsy of the mummy. He's harder than marble. Gentlemen, we are faced with a phenomenon that is unbelievable ... and of which I cannot give you any explanation. Whatever the substance that penetrated the body ... is certainly unknown to our science. We are groping in the dark, amigos. I am afraid that with the death Bedford and his henchmen ... and the disappearance of Pablito... We lost the only lead in this tangled web. In your place I would not be so pessimistic. At least we have exposed Bedford... and have put an end to the trafficking of arms into Mexico. I'm afraid that Jim Bedford was merely a pawn. A pawn in a much bigger game. Carson ... you remember that scholar ... who lives in the Spanish fortress beyond the Rio Bravo? El Morisco. Maybe he would help. The air is still heavy in Mexico dangerous times, Willer. Desperados are ready to kill for a fistful of dollars ... The Rural Guard are a mean bunch, suspicious of everyone. What fun ... A beautiful prospect! Now you are the one who is pessimistic, sheriff. Are you are confident that there is someone here... You want to turn back already? But .. Come on, friends, please! Eusebio informed me of your arrival ... He saw you approaching. Morisco welcomes you. Why, you don't? whenever you come here you bring trouble. Eusebio the pessimist ... take a seat! of course, it is always a real pleasure to see you here in Mexico. This Piranha fish is always hungry. Shame on you teasing an old critter like me.. This way. Always the same old grumpy Carson. We drink on it? It seems to me a great idea. Bring us something to drink my faithful Eusebio. - Tequila? - And with salt and lemon! What brings you to Mexico? Morisco, must help us to solve an incredible mystery. But we have a clue.. this. Fantastic! What do you say "fantastic"? - You know what it is? - Certainly. It's Xiuhtecutli.. An ancient Aztec god. Many years ago, I happened to look at ... another statue depicting the Xiuhtecutli. It was an artefact at least four centuries old ... however, this one seems to have been carved recently. And also ... hell, look! A horn is not fixed. The bottom of the mouth is hinged I think that can be opened. Holy moly! - what's that? - I do not know yet. Don't touch it, for the love of heaven! It seems phosphorus. I want to perform an experiment. Exactly what I thought. That? This is almost certainly the product of an eruption ... due to molten rock and magmatic material ... pushed to the surface by endogenous forces. - You mean of volcanic origin? - Precisely. Follow me. I want to see if my hypothesis is correct. I'd like to figure it out! Let's see if the piranhas can give us the answer. Look! he's going to eat. By the Great Spirit! Mummified dead! Yeah. This is the same death that hit the man in Presidio ... and your friend Ted Murphy. Which volcanic are may have produced this terrible drug? Unfortunately I can only guess of that hypothesis. Come! That's it. Look. This is the region Sierra Encantada ... a land of the ancient Aztecs. Consider sacred, probably due to the presence ... numerous volcanic caves. - And who lives there? - No one that I know of. You would have to be crazy to live there. an inaccessible area, mountainous ... roasted during the day and freezes when night falls. Anyway, It's getting late now ... and we still have many things to talk about. I would be very honoured if for this night ... you'd like to accept my humble hospitality. It seems to me a great nice idea, amigo! Do not move! - Throw down the knife! - Who are you? In my veins runs the same Indian blood as yours. - Do not dare to kill a brother. - No, I will not ... But you must keep the sons of death ... away from those who live in this house. I know it's the idol of Xiuhtecutli you came looking for ... You known too many secrets, brother! Curse the devil! What's up? Eusebio! Eusebio! He was tall, rather thin. with high cheek bones. Pablito! I just wonder how it is he tracked us here. The worshipers of the god Xiuhtecutli have many eyes and many ears ... on this side of the Rio Bravo. I believe that Eusebio has something to tell us. Yes, that's true, I should spoken up last night. They run rumours that a mysterious tribe ... who has withdrawn into a secret valley in the Sierra Encantada. They live among the ruins of a abandoned fortress. Like the ancient Aztecs, they practice human sacrifice ... in honour of the god Xiuhtecutli ... the terrible god of fire. They chase a dream of power and greatness ... and unite all the Indian tribes of Mexico ... in order to exterminate and defeat ... all descendants of the Spanish conquistadors. But it is a suicidal madness! An unnecessary war ... would cost the lives of many innocent ... and conclude with the extermination of the Indian people. Sure, I know. It would be a massacre ... but the Indians are confident their arms are forged for them ... by the Lord of the Deep. The stones of death. The Lord of the Deep ... But what ... Do not ask more, Mr. Willer. Every time I tried to some information ... all I've found are tight-lips ... and wild-eyed terror. Why did you not tell me this before Eusebo? To save you a horrible death. Yes. The death that awaits anyone who dares to enter the Sierra Encantada. Oh, hell! It would be better the Mexican troops ... and let them sort it out. No. No, military involvement ... it would just cause a useless Indian war. You do not plan to face that horde of fanatics alone? First we must discover where is their refuge ... and only who can tell us is our old friend Pablito. What a disgusting place! That lousy dog Bedford has not shown up yet. You should have sold those weapons to Rurales. The Indian friends pay Bedford better. Besides you are forgetting one thing, Marcos ... If you're thinking about the Yaqui treasure, forget it! There's too many of those selvages. They would carve us up and feed our guts to the vultures ... just for even thinking about it. El Dorado! There's someone coming! Careful with that dynamite, imbecile! Pablito! Toma water. What has happened? Take away their weapons, before those three dogs come here ... Who, Pablito? One Indian and two Yankees. One of them is Tex Willer. Tex Willer ... That bastard! Bedford and others, where are they? All ... all dead ... like me ... You move, load the weapons on the bandwagon! Hurry, you idiots! There is no time to lose! I want to leave this damned village before nightfall. Vamos, Juan! you too! Keep your eyes open them damn Rangers are good. I hope that stupid Indian Pablito did not lead them here. I wonder what he would go to an abandoned village for. He was wounded, but we must still be careful. God darn it! the only things we will see here are only mice and cockroaches ... Let's go! Go! Only rats and cockroaches, is not it? They are out of range ... I told you to wait, idiots! Eyes open! I'm going to tell El Dorado. Good. Good, Dynamite! - How many are there? - At least ten. Too many. If we go they'll below us apart ... What do you say we eat a little 'dust Viva the spurs. They are almost ready ... Get ready to go. El Dorado! And those three? If they approach ... I will blast them to hell! Mother of God! You're itching to get your paws on all that Tulach gold. And you are not? Watch out! - They're coming back here. - You, on the wagon! Vamos! Damn it! In the cabin, Carson! 'I'll Cover you! Back! Back! Circondiamoli! The wagon ... - Bastards! - It has been smashed! What do we do? You'll see! El Dorado! Vamos! Sorry, Marcos ... there's no room for both of us! Carson over here! What has happened? He's 'still alive. The others got away didn?t they? Bastards! Some will go to hide Sierra Encantada ... the temple ... of Xiuhtecutli. Tell me, how many men are there in this temple? Not many, now ... But more will arrive ... from all the villages ... in the Sierra ... in the next few days ... Led by Maguire..... By Maguire? Come on, amigo! End of the trail for Pablito. And the end of the trail for three hundred new rifles... and a magnificent horse. Adios, Amigo! It hurts. You need a doctor ... To shoot me full of pills? Better than the old remedies. You're right. Tex You recognize the ringleader, that son of a dog? El Dorado. Yeah, him. I thought it was to rotting in some Mexican prison. The jackal escaped. If you still intend to delve into the Sierra ... We can also prepare three beautiful coffins. You can relax, I'm going alone. Get yourself turned into a withered mummy... I don't care! I will not go into den of those crazy Indians. I want to meet Maguire. He was once considered to be a very wise leader. I am coming too. No, We stand a better chance if I am alone Do you remember that old Indian well in the desert? - Vultures Well ? - Meet me there tomorrow. Vultures well ... what a horrid meeting place! What Signs do you read in the sacred brazier, Kanas? The eyes of the god of fire, Xiuhtecutli ... smile for our plans, noble Tulach. At the second rising of the sun, all the tribes of the Sierra ... will gather under the command Maguire. Ready to fight the invaders, we shall burn their towns. On those ruins we will build ... the new kingdom Children of the Sun! El Dorado has returned, Noble Kanas. - Did you bring weapons? - They will arrive here tomorrow. Tomorrow? Should have been Here ... days ago! We were attacked by a band of gringos ... at the ruined church. That dog was Pablito was followed like an idiot! Pablito ... where is he now? In hell. He paid for his crime with his life. By the gods! Who are these gringos? Talk! They were led by a Yankee named Tex Willer ... but now they are back in the kennel where they came from. You bring disasters, El Dorado. And for this reason alone, you deserve a painful death! Many of my men are died to defend your guns! Give me the gold that you owe me and I will return tomorrow with the guns. Gold ... that is all you have in your heart! No! he will get the gold when we get the guns! These were not the terms. See you later I do not like that man, Kanas. The day that he is no longer any use to us ... the spectre of death walk at his side. And the infidels who have killed Pablito ? To reach the temple, There is only one road. and if they are so foolish as to follow it ... they will soon discover that it is a road of no return. Honour and glory to you, Lord of the Abyss! Same to you, noble Tulach! The armies preparing to attack. The fire Xiuhtecutli has been eaten ... much of our body. Too much time has elapsed! It was necessary to arm our followers. The stones of death can defeat the enemy? No, the weapons of the white man are much more powerful ... and strike from long distances! But these ... these were the weapons of our ancestors. In battle, we will sow terror among the enemy! As the stars join in the black night's sky ... so the Indian tribes will gather between the gorges of the Sierra Encantada. So remember your words ... Lord of the Abyss! Over there, Tiger! Vultures Well ... this place is so happy that even The vultures have left! Erase all traces! Hurry! Return to the village! May the Great Spirit be with you Maguire! This is the wish of Night Eagle... white chief of the Navajos. You know my reputation. What brings you to our Encantada, Night Eagle? Peace. Peace for the Yaqui and Peace for the whites. Words of nonsense, without meaning! My people are tired of the tyranny of the white man. They have stolen our land ... and have suppressed our honour. Silence this white snake.... he cannot crawl with impunity in our village, father? No, Quetzal! Night Eagle came in peace. But his heart is poisonous! I will tear it out and show you! He offended you, it was your right to kill him. I did not want to wound the heart of a wise chief... But the blood of many other hearts will flow soon ... in the mountains of the Sierra! Last night the drums speak of the tribes. And our destiny will be finally decided. You hear them, white dog? They are the drums of the Yaqui tribe. And to call the warriors to the big meeting tomorrow. Both you and this renegade Navajo ... will be sacrificed to the Lord of Fire! Your heart-rending cries will rise up to heaven ... and right from the sky our strength will emerge. You know what.. You can go to hell! - Throw them Down! - Oh, damn! Ignorant idiot! That Kanas is a true evil rattlesnake ... But I was not talking about him I was speaking about me! Why can't I ever learn to keep my big mouth shut! Watch out! Kanas and His posse are coming. Sangre del Diablo If by chance that Rangers told him ... that the weapons have been destroyed... the savages will cut us to pieces! Calm down, Pedro, we need to gain some time. The only thing that matters right now... is to get that gold and get the hell out of here! The day is dying, El Dorado, and I do not see any rifles. Fear not, noble Kanas. they will come by tonight ... or at latest tomorrow morning. You know what to expect If you lie to me ... I've never cheated in the past? the other shipments always arrived on time! If you want, I'll go myself to meet the wagons ... and before sunrise you have your weapons, Kanas! Send one of your men! Him What are you waiting for, you idiot? Come on, what are you waiting for? Move! No one else leaves without my permission! - Stop! - Do not shoot, damn! Cannot you see I'm alone? Sangre del Diablo! You could have broken my neck! It would have been a great loss ... Hey! What the hell are you doing? I just want to ask you a few questions about your Indian friends. You aint going to get no easy answers from me, Ranger! I imagined him. You are one tough hombre You know, I've spent a lot time with the Apaches. They are savages. Cruel and primitive. Even the jokers ... Real jokers. Especially ... especially when they decide to torture one of their prisoners. I think only the Apache gets to have all the fun... I never did like those Apaches. The man of El Dorado is coming back. Run and tell Kanas. The Mexican told the truth. This place is an arsenal! Now I finally know the truth about the weapons. What happened? - Come on, you're there. - Yes .. It 'a real pleasure to see your ugly face ... Hell! Madre de Dios! Go! Move! Hurry! What the hell was that, Tex? Take a guess! Tiger, there is a rifle over there Come on! Damn dogs! Stop them! Look out! Dynamite! Do not let them get away ... otherwise the wrath of god will fall on your heads! Next! We will never make it to them horses! - I'll hide out up there. - Go, will cover you! - Come on! - Go! Where will this tunnel go ... Who knows? There is a strange light. Look out! The sun is high the tribes are about to gather. Prepare it for the sacrifice. The guts of this dog will appease the wrath of the God Xiuhtecutli! Night Eagle ... Welcome back to the world of the living, Tiger! Are you all right? My shoulder ... This damned wound has reopened! Any idea where we are? I wish I knew. Hey, there's a current of air! Maybe there is a way out! The valley is deserted! Where are the warriors of the Yaqui tribe? And yet I heard the drums ... to rally all the Indians of the Sierra! Magu! Because your son Quetzal does not ride at your side, Maguire? And where are your warriors? They will not come, Kanas! The council of elders have met... and instructed me to plead and to convince you to desist from a war that is hopeless! Noble Kanas ... how can we fight without the other tribes of the Sierra? Traitor! You'll pay your cowardice! Kill that snake! Kanas, listen to me! The white man will darken the sky ... and descend upon us like a swarm of hungry locusts! And our dreams of glory... will vanish into thin air! This is how the great God deals with traitors! may the Children of the Sun meet the same fate! Drag them to the sacrificial altar! What of the future old Carson? I have a bad feeling. And for us it has a better one? Hey, the tunnel splits! Which way are we going? You stay here and wait. Meanwhile, you can patch up that wound. I'm going to see where this passage leads. I agree. God of fire ... Who is the infidel who dares violate your sacred home? Receive him, Xiuhtecutli, between your eternal flames! Stop! Did you want to get yourself killed? I just wanted to know what Hell he had vomited! The mighty ... The Wrath of Xiuhtecutli! Let's go! Go! Go! She keeps the horses! Horses! Hurry, it's falling! You cowards, come back! Look up there! Looks like a way out, Let's go! Tiger, come on! You want to get roasted? Let's go! There we are! Tex! Even before the gods appear on their golden steeds, to guide us to victory, the Black Hawks, ambassadors of doom ... have clawed their hopes for the glory of the chosen people. Your voice imperious, Divine Xiuhtecutli ... can no longer be heard ... and lost in the silence a night without waking. May the light of green stones shine ... again for one last time in the presence of the gods, Xiuhtecutli ... and your humble and faithful servants! The queen is certainly in there! In the throne room! Come on, Tiger! They are all gone. Some of these fanatics there may be hidden up ... inside the cave. This seems to be the end of the trail. Holy Lucifer! Whoever they were, they demonstrated courage and dignity. They thought they were doing it for justice. Have you heard? This place is haunted. Let's go on it, quick! With great pleasure! Hold still, Willer! Throw down that gun! Throw it, quick! And your hands! Stupid bastard! This does not surprise you, Like a true ranger? I thought you were already nailed in Hell, El Dorado! I was almost, you bastard! But something kept me clinging to life ... the treasure of those dirty savages! and the look on you face when I blast you to hell ... You might get there first... if you do not avoid that snake creeping towards you! think I am so stupid to believe that, well you're wrong ... The opposing forces of good beat the demons of the night. Sometimes fate intervenes in the eternal battle ... where there are no winners or losers. And sometimes, those who had embarked on a path of evil... retraces his steps. Here ends the land of the Yaqui. And from here we must go our separate ways Night Eagle. Do not forget your promise of peace, Quetzal. It is engraved in my heart! Vamonos, amigos! With the Dawn came peace to Sierra Encantada... and Night Eagle rides towards the Navajo village. But on the horizon gather black clouds charged with trouble... This will be another story, now is not the time to tell it. soon, so ... and fear not, time is our ally! and fear not, time is our ally!
