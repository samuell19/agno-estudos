What happened? Oh, fucking hell. - I'm sorry. - Dude! When there's something in the way you're supposed to stop! Sorry, I was just... - I just bought it three days ago! - Fuck! Three days ago? I can't believe it, fuck. Listen, are you okay? - Unbelievable. - Are you hurt? I'll pay for everything. I was fiddling with the radio and suddenly... Get me your information. - Your insurance information! - Oh, sure, yes. Sorry. We'll sort this out. Insurance companies pay for everything nowadays. Oh, gosh. Here you go. Look. What is this? Documents from the Dental Association? You just want to say you're a dentist? No, I'm not a dentist. My dad is a dentist and so is my granddad. I'm studying to become one but it's not really what I'll do. Here it is, look. Your insurance has expired. I'm horrible at keeping up with paperwork. You ripped off my door! Why don't we call a tow truck? Okay. Okay, you call, I'll go check... I'll check this out. Hi. I'm calling because someone into crashed my car. I'm on the phone. Sorry, yes, that's right. Belén Correas. I'm so sorry. Four hours? Four hours? Of course I'll wait. Yes, I'm at 1500 Sucre Street. Bye. Sure, no need to be careful. You ripped it off anyway. It's just that this thing here... I think it requires a special tool, I can't... It's Belén, right? - Belén, yes. - I'm Federico. Listen, Belén. I'll pay for your car door. Don't worry. I'll pay for the window, the installation. You don't have to worry. And I'll stay until the tow truck arrives. Even if it takes ten hours. It's the least I can do. Sure. Listen. We got off on the wrong foot. But when this is all fixed, would you go out with me? Is this a joke? You ripped off my door, and you're asking me out? - I don't get it. - I am, yes. I don't get it either. It's just that... I can't help but think this is a miracle. You and me? Absolutely not. THE MARRIAGE APP We're almost there. A FEW YEARS LATER... Tilt your head this way. There you go, perfect. I'll take this off so you can rinse now. Don't worry, accidents happen all the time. I'm sure our expert can fix it. You know how it is. She had it for two seconds, and it broke. If I glue this on, it will fall off. I can call the manufacturer, ask if they have a replacement doll. That might work. Hey, I'll get going. You can't, you still have one more patient. Really? We'll have to cancel it. Make something up. We cancel appointments every day. Every day? Don't be so dramatic. We only cancel appointments if there is a special occasion. And it's Tuesday. Tuesday, of course. Okay, go. - Love you. - Me too. Best mom ever. Hi, Fede. Can you get dinner sorted? Nothing fancy or I don't know... Asian. Maybe we can have milanesas. Or some steak, nice and easy. A kitchen is kind of like a soul. It's a place where everything we've learned... Also, did you check the toilet bowl? It was about to overflow. Did you pay the credit card bills? They were due this week. Of course, honey. Don't worry. Did you hear that? "Of course, honey. Don't worry." Is he messing with me? Hello! - Hello. - Hi, honey. Hi there. How are you, Nelly? I was just about to leave. I don't feel well. I couldn't finish. Belén, tomorrow I'm taking the day off. I got my period, I feel awful. Your period? Yes, why do you ask? No, it's just... No reason. I didn't do the dishes because you're out of dish soap. You need to buy some. Okay, I will. - Did you check the toilet? - Yes, it's about to overflow. I know, I asked you to fix it. I'll fix it tomorrow, for sure. It's this wire that requires a special tool, but I'll fix it. Did you cook dinner? I didn't see anything. Did you ask me? I thought you were bringing it. I misunderstood, sorry. I'm an idiot. I did make some delicious bruschetta. No, thanks. I meant like a real meal. Goodbye! Goodbye! Remember that I'm starting my vacation next week for a month. - Yes. - Thanks, Nelly. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Did you pay the bills? - Tomorrow. You know I'm bad with paperwork. I'm helpless. Did Mica leave her room? Honey, everything is okay. The house is okay. The kids are okay. You're a great mom, don't worry. We'll fix everything tomorrow. - I need to go, I'm running late. - I know. - Love you. - Bye. Toto, dinner. If it's not too much trouble, I'd rather finish my book and eat in my room. Okay, since you asked that nicely... - What's for dinner? - Pasta with cheese and butter. Didn't Dad cook today? No. Howdy, vegans. I'm Honey. In this video I'm going to teach you to be as viral as yours truly. And those poor vegetables... Mica! - Mom! - Don't "Mom" me, I knocked. Dinner's ready. I'll eat here. Not this one too. The whole thing? Try this. Try it, Reni. Does it need anything? Delicious. - So nice. - It's the perfect pairing. Why is it called "pairing"? It's weird, right? It's like a marriage. Two different components that combine in perfect harmony. They don't overwhelm, but complement each other. There's a wine for every dish. What goes with cabernet? Red meat, cheese. - Merlot? - Curry and tacos. Latte? Quince pie. Guys. What? What is it? We got selected for the cooking contest. - The one in Mexico? - Yes. Arata Tanaka's. Tanaka is going to try our food? If this is a joke, we'll kill you. - Why would I joke about this? - Let me see. It will be held in Cancún, Mexico. December 1st to December 11th. Four elimination stages. Pasta, quesadillas, barbecue meat. Then a freestyle stage. - Bao buns! - We'll cook our bao buns. We're going to kill this! I'll take every job from here on, so I can be ready. I'll tell Javi right now. Will he have a problem? No, but we're planning a trip together. And will you tell her? Tell who? Belén. What? Yes, obviously. It's ten days in December, you'll be leaving her in the lurch. What do you mean? No, I'll tell her for sure when I get home. No big deal. - It's going to be amazing. - Cheers! To Cancún! We're going to crush this! Hi, honey. I'm glad you're awake. I have some amazing news. Fede, I'm tired. Oh. Okay. Get some rest. We'll talk tomorrow. No. Are you really that oblivious? What is it, honey? You always make plans away from home. When you're home, you're not really here. What? All right. Forget I said anything. You said you had some news. What is it? I don't know, I forgot. You see? You're not really here. Do you know how long it's been since we've really talked? Talk about what? What to eat for dinner? The bills? So you get what I'm saying. Of course, I do pay attention. - But you don't care. - I do care. You don't talk, you give orders. What are you saying? Anything I do, you're watching over my shoulder. "Do this, not that. Forget it, I'll do it." But you do it wrong! - I do what I can. - No, you do less than what you can. Because you know I'm always behind you fixing everything. I do things in my own time. But you want things done in your own time, otherwise they're wrong. You're the one that feels like you need to do everything. Somebody around here has to! Then I'll step up. I'll take care of the kids, make dinner. Really. Let's not argue. - I don't want to fight. - Me neither. Then we won't. Let's go on a date. We can ask Nelly to babysit tomorrow. We can't tomorrow. We're having dinner with Nati and Germán. Oh, no, fuck! - Isn't your sister separated? - No, she's not. - Then cancel. - I haven't seen her in a while. She's having marital troubles. I can't cancel. Oh, Jesus. Okay, hear me out. We'll go to dinner with those two bores. Okay? We'll go. We'll watch them argue over everything and realize that our marriage is not so bad. We have a reservation under Belén and Natalia Correas. Yes, here it is. Follow me, please. The waiter will be right with you. Hi, guys. How are you doing? What's up? How is it going? Great, how about you? Good. Good! - Welcome. - Thanks. Nice place, huh? - Beautiful. - It's a new discovery. I call it "the Temple of Restaurants." - We come here a lot. - It's my favorite place. - Great service, marvelous drinks. - The drinks are to die for. And of course... Hi. ...beautiful people. Good evening. - Hi. - Good evening. Have you ordered already? We ordered drinks. What? Cinnamon Mix. Is it good? - Delicious. - It's an aphrodisiac. Never disappoints. Neither does this guy. - So good. - Yes. Very good. What can I get you? Check out the starters. They have some tapas. They're great. The prawns here... So juicy. An authentic taste of the Iberian Peninsula. What a peninsula, right? Okay, then. We'll have that, and I'll have a glass of wine. I want what she's having. That's great! Trying new things is awesome. - We'll have the tapas. - Okay. What are you guys...? What? What's going on? You look happy. - You look like you're doing great. - We are. - We went through a rough patch. - So rough. And now we're great. - We're doing great. - We're amazing. What is it that you're doing? Are you going to marriage counseling? - No. - No way. Is it that shaman guy? - No, not the shaman. - No. Are you guys swingers now? - No! - No. So what is it? What are you doing? - I'm not sure we can tell you. - Wait. I'd like to help them out. - It's not for them. - Why not? Please, it's my sister. Okay. Tell them. Are you guys ready for love? For actual true love? Of course, our whole life is love. But for true happiness... EQUILIBRIUM - Equilibrium? - Equilibrium. "We make 'happy ever after' come to life." They only take referrals. You need someone to refer you, and we can do that for you. There's a code here. You scan it to get an initial consultation. No more disagreements. Your love will be reset. Forever. Right? It's a pyramid scheme. I can smell it. They're up to their elbows in shit. I want to go. To that place? I told you about my patient. He joined a scheme, lost a fortune. He lost properties, an inheritance. They fleeced him! I get that you're suspicious. But what if it's real? What if it really works? It's not real. He was biting her shoulder! It was gross, I know. It's so unlike them. Last time we went to their house, Natalia almost threw a bag of coal at him! The way he looked at her! I want you to look at me like that again. Like what? Remember how you used to look at me? Yes, of course. Then look at me. Not like that. - No. - Wait. No. Give me a second, I'll get it! Hold on. Forget it. It's useless, I know. EQUILIBRIUM Correas and Iribarne? - Yes. - Yes. Welcome. Milan is waiting for you. - Will you follow me? - Sure. These guys are con artists. Did you see that entryway? Smoke and mirrors. They have a bonsai tree. It's weird. Stop that. Go ahead. Belén and Federico. What beautiful names. Belén, from the Hebrew "Betania," "the house of bread." Federico derives from German. "King of peace." My name is Milan. It's a Hindu name which means "union." Curious, huh? Do you know why we're here? No, we don't. My sister swears by this, and... We don't plan on buying in. - No way. - We're curious. Sure. You're curious to know if this place holds the answers you're looking for. Come with me, please. Thanks, Olson. Natalia and Germán had those watches. Not watches, but scales. These scales will help you balance your relationship. I'm lost. You know that, for a marriage to work, besides love, which is crucial, there needs to be balance. Equilibrium. It's all about giving and receiving. When we give more or receive less, problems arise. That lack of balance causes the relationship to falter. What these devices do is keep track of the miles you earn or lose. Miles? Miles for what you do in your relationship. For everything that either helps or hurts your marriage. Oh, it's like a spreadsheet. Yes, something like that. Some call it points, or "marriage miles." Marriage miles? Yes. Equilibrium evolves the concept of marriage miles. Let's put it this way. Fede. If you watch porn and then masturbate, you lose miles. But if you make love to Belén, you earn miles. Belén, if you ignore Fede's needs, you lose miles. But if you make his fantasies come true, you earn miles. You might think this can make you calculating, but believe me, you've been doing this for a while, just without keeping track of it. How do these watches know what we do? It's cutting-edge tech from Japan. It has a holotropic camera which scans biometric information. It measures your serotonin, dopamine, and all the neurotransmitters that manage your emotions. Our algorithm cross-references those levels with your activity and comes up with a value that assigns miles based on what you do. I'm sorry. Why would we keep track of the miles? Once you rack up enough miles, you can spend it on plans without your partner. Like frequent flyer miles. It's groundbreaking. An emotional cryptocurrency to keep love alive. You can spend them on nights out, sporting events, trips with friends, you decide. The best part is you don't need to feel guilty. How much is it? I see. Yes. It's too expensive for us. It's a lot of money. Thanks for your time, Milan. Let's go. Wait. Can we have a second? Of course. I know it's a lot of money. I get it's a lot to spend. But maybe this is what we need. You said you wanted us to look at each other the way we used to. Are you sure? I don't know, maybe. Can we pay in installments? Once we activate the watches, you're not allowed to take them off for the first 30 days. After that time, you can remove them willingly. Why is that? It's the amount of time we feel is necessary to guarantee positive results with this method. Are you ready? Good. Then Equilibrium welcomes you to your new life as a couple. Fede. No matter what happens, thank you. I appreciate what you're doing for me. MEXICO IS WAITING I love you, honey. Let's wait for it to take effect. "Redeeming miles." "Trips to sporting events," no. "Trips with friends." "Trips abroad with friends," there we go. Trip duration... 1000 MILES A thousand miles? That's so many miles. Hi, honey. How are you? Just wanted to check in on you. I miss you a lot. I can't wait to come home and love up on you. Love you. Just one mile? This is crazy! You get one mile for a message and need a thousand for a trip? YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL THIS MORNING. LOVE YOU, FEDE - What are you watching? - Don't worry. We'll watch your show. - No! - Yes, of course! No, let's watch your thing. Absolutely not. I'll just... Give me that. - Can I? - No. No. No! Equilibrium rewards prioritizing your partner's pleasure over your own. ASIAN FOOD RECIPES Wow, what a meal your Daddy prepared! Oh, you're here! Everything looks delicious! Wow, that color looks amazing on you. That blue is gorgeous! Have you tried it already? Now it's ready. This is amazing. Honey, you're an artist! I am. I'd like to be your masterpiece. You're more than that, you're my muse. I think about you always. Let me sculpt you up. This leaf. What is it? Lettuce. It's just perfect. Check under your plates. Maybe I didn't wash them right and there's still dirt. Maybe you'll find a stain or something. Oh, honey! It smells like you. We might be in a parallel universe. What the hell is up with them? Maybe they're going through a midlife crisis. Belén. I love you so much. Me too. Dessert... will be served in bed. Oh, goodness. - Are you okay? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes. Okay, come on. Come on in. Careful, hon, it's heavy. Hello! Don't break anything. Leave it there. Just there, thanks. You're too kind. You shouldn't have! - I could have done it. - It's no problem, hon. This was on my way. Your dental office is on the other side of town. You got me, Juani. Juana. Juana. - Hi. - How are you? All right, honey. FEDE: 340 MILES BELÉN: 210 MILES I love you! I love you more! I can't believe this, Juani. Me neither. What's gotten into you? Remember that place I told you about? Equilibrium? Don't tell me you're still at it. We just started. It's for 30 days. But still... It's been less than a week and I'm seeing huge changes. Belu, I love you. But this miles thing is so stupid! You're only proving how sad and miserable relationships are. I used to think the same thing. But I realized with this method Fede started noticing things we've been missing. Now we're focused on the important things. That method is creepy! It gives you miles for every good deed you do for him. Come on, you've become a slave to love! It's sick. It's sinister. Forget it, you've become a fucking fundamentalist. Oh, come on. Fede, sorry to be such a pain, but I need the money today. It's the last day, remember? I know, but don't pressure me. I still don't know if I can. What do you mean? Wasn't the watch thing enough? No, it's super complicated, I need a lot of miles, a thousand. Get her a huge bouquet of flowers. That's four miles. A huge one? Maybe five. Refill the ice tray. Three miles. I'm doomed, bro. What about if you ask her about her day? That would be about 20 miles. Not bad. Those can add up. But you can only do that once a day. And it takes up so much time! If I ask her, she answers, you know? And I have to ask follow-up questions that make sense, otherwise I lose miles. It's not that easy. I don't know what else to do. You see, it's an intricate balance. I lose some for cooking with you on Tuesday. It's like a trade in. I get miles and I lose them. It's hard to get more. Well, why don't you just talk to her? Just ask her and stop speculating. - That's not an option. - Why not? - Because. - Fede... I said no, Reni! Listen. If you want a new car, but don't have the money, you save up and pay in installments. And in the end, you get a Ferrari. How can you buy a Ferrari? In installments. Same here. One mile. Another mile. Another. And then? - Cancún. - Cancún. - I'm doing it. I don't give a fuck. - Do it. BANK TRANSFER 155,000 PESOS Am I being a complete asshole? - You'll compensate with miles. - Plus, getting miles is not bad. The opposite. It's a big deal. - We'll see Tanaka. - Come on! TRANSFER COMPLETE What the hell. Yes! - We're going to Cancún! - We need miles. - We need to get you lots of miles. - I'm going to need your help. Oh, you beat me to it. This is for you. Morning. - How did you sleep? - Fine. I made you blueberry juice, coffee, toast... You know what? No more breakfast in bed. It's nice, but it takes all morning. You're right. You want some quick coffee? Okay, sure. You know what? I had a thought this morning. Take the day off. Use some miles, I'll watch the kids. - Maybe I could. - Right? - It would do me good. - Yes. - Can you take this to the kitchen? - Sure. "Every couple has issues." Tell me about it. "Try taking a deep breath and asking: 'What is it that you want?'" Dad. Just a minute, Toto, this is important. "'What is it that you want?' are the six magic words that can get you out of trouble." You do know that article has no scientific value at all, right? That doesn't mean it has no philosophical value. We'll play some video games later. I don't want to. I don't think video games provide proper stimulation for my brain. Toto, what is it that you want? Hello. Hi, how are you? - Good, and you? - Great. My son Antonio, "Toto," wants to join the team. You see, my team right now, Toto, are kids who have been playing and training for years. They're pretty advanced. You'd have to sit on the bench. If you don't mind... The bench is not a bad place to start. Maybe he can play for a few minutes. He might surprise you. Welcome. Let's see, Toto. - He's got a lot to learn. - A lot. What a cool place! I told you. - Isn't it nice? - It is. Shall we sit? I come here often. They make amazing drinks. Just amazing. There's one called Glorian Mix, it's delicious. - You'll love it. - Sounds delicious. Juani? - Galita! - What are you doing here? Hi! - Gala, this is Belu. Belu, this is Gala. - Hello. She's the best waitress ever, and an even better actress. I think she's not a waitress, she's just playing one. No, I'm a waitress who auditions a lot. I still haven't landed a big role. What are you having? - A beer for me. - Okay. Okay, I'll get a Gorilla Mix. It's called "Glorian Mix." - Two of those. - Okay, beautiful ladies. Now spill. How are things with Fede? The watch? Your sex life! Oh! It's good, really good. It seems to be happening more often, you know? Okay, but we both know it's not about quantity, but... Size, right? Is it size? No, dummy. It's about quality. Oh, I haven't told you yet. For Fede's birthday... - What? - I wore a costume. That same costume you've been wearing for 20 years? You need something new. New experiences. Try swinging. - Sex toys, maybe. - No way. I'm telling you, Belu, unless you start trying new things, spicing things up, things might end. Well... If I had your life, the things I would do... What would you do? Take a trip. Where to? I don't know. I'd start in India. Maybe see the Taj Mahal, drink some chai tea. Who knows? Maybe roaming around India would inspire a new line of toys. Thanks. - Here you go. - Thanks, Gala. Enjoy. - You need to try it. - Okay. You know, you don't need anyone's permission. Not Fede's, not those watch people. You're free and you can do anything you want. Would I lose miles for ordering another drink? - Let's fight the system. - Yes. Two more, right? Let's go for it. Come on, Toto, you need to keep practicing. - Hi! - Hello. - Hey! What are you up to? - Hi. We're just hanging out. How nice, everyone together! Hi, sweetie. - Hi! - How are you? Good. Great. Listen, there's this drink you need to try. Gloria Mix. Have you tried it? Rum, lemon juice, mango extract, seltzer and sugar? You know it. - Gonza makes them. - Who is Gonza? Gonza! Do I know him? Where did you go? Toto, what are you doing with the ball inside? He is in a team now. - No way! - He is! - He signed up today. - Really? Hey! Fist bump! Are you recording me? No, I'm just looking at my phone. Pointed at your mom's face? What is going on? You're so self-absorbed! Nobody is recording you, man. Let's go, Toto. You're the only one who lets me record. She was a lot nicer as a kid, right? - We did a shit job with her. - We did. Honey. What? What is it that you want? What do you mean? I don't... Exactly that. What do you want? If you could do anything now without having to think of anyone else. - What do you want? - To get away. No, I mean... I meant like to get away, travel. Maybe get away from the house for a bit. You want to go on a trip? Yes. WELCOME EARTH 2 Welcome! Hello. We hope you enjoy our facilities and your stay. - That's enough. - Okay. Equilibrium reminds you of our annual Equilibrium Party. - It will be... - Okay, done. I turned off your notifications. Now we can enjoy our time here. - You're brilliant, you know? - Come on... It was as easy as setting a phone alarm. - It's not that... - No, you're a genius. I don't just mean because of this. You know what I'd like to do after this long walk? I can think of a few things. No, I'm serious. I'd like to have one of your bao buns. The ones with stuffing. Don't butter me up, you don't like them. What? - You eat them out of obligation. - No, I love them. I mean it! - Really? - Yes. I love your cooking. And I love watching you cook. I actually think you should try to spend more time doing that. Wow. Can I tell you something? Not now. I love you. Are you saying it to get miles? No. No, I mean it. I do. Are we going to be okay? We are. I promise. What the hell is going on? Fede, how are the miles coming? Are you getting more? We leave for Cancún on December 1st. Tell me you have enough miles. I talked to Tanaka, I have my sunscreen ready. Everything's set. EQUILIBRIUM PROGRAM HANDBOOK Hi. Why are you here so early? I'm reading something. Did you have to do it crouching down like some thief in hiding? Yes. It's a handbook. A handbook? - What for? - I can't tell you now. Fine, mystery girl. I'm making some tea. - You want some? - Sure. Black tea, green tea, chai? Chai! I want chai. Wow, that's a lot of excitement over a simple beverage. It just reminded me of our talk. The trip to India? Right. Would you go with me? Absolutely! I would totally... How about December 1st? 20 days or so. You have it all planned. Wonderful! - Are you okay? - I'm splendid! Good. Did you get a lot? - Of what? - Miles. No, it wasn't about miles at all. We had a great time. We connected. We haven't connected in a long time. It was really... I'm glad. You can bring her something from Cancún. Yeah... I should tell her about that. You still haven't? I couldn't. - Why not? - It didn't come up. - "It didn't come up"? - It just didn't! I tried to, but it just felt weird. I didn't want to ruin things. But this is really important to you! She'll understand. But going on a trip without her and the kids is not... - It's not that easy. - We signed up. You can't back out now. Talk to her, I'm sure she'll support you. She'll be happy. Just tell her. - Are you sure? - I am. Is there anything more beautiful than a pile of rice? And this is the staff of God. Food is our life. Life is our food! Beauty, happiness, dreams. Bao buns are the greatest creation. We'll chop everything up. Chop everything. I LOVE YOU Hi, sweetheart! Hi! What happened? You cleaned the whole house. I did. Equilibrium rewards participants who can step out of their comfort zone to please their partners. Congratulations. You turned on notifications. This is just incredibly delicious. - I love it. - I'm glad, honey. - So tasty. - I'm glad you like it. - Where are the kids? - Upstairs. In their rooms, as usual. I see. It needs some salt. Okay, thanks. - You've racked up a lot of miles lately. - Oh, really? You know that, right? - No way. - A lot of miles. Maybe. Don't try so hard. I don't care about the miles. - I mean it! - You're so sweet. - I'm serious. - I know. Good. What about you? You've racked up a lot of miles too. Not a lot. Maybe I didn't notice them adding up. You haven't used any. Not yet. - I don't have any plans yet. - That's okay. That's okay. Don't tell me... No, that wouldn't... Don't tell me you want to use them for a trip to... I don't know, maybe say... Cancún? No way! Let me explain. - Explain what? - Reni, Gonza and I... - I don't care about them. - We got selected for a contest. A competition for amateur cooks. - I tried to tell you... - How nice! - It's a huge opportunity. - Okay. That sounds nice. Unfortunately, you should know that I'm also saving up miles for a trip. A trip to where? I'm going with Juana to visit the Taj Mahal. December 1st. Twenty days or so. A short trip. When I get to 1,000 miles, I'm going. The Taj Mahal? What are you talking about? Besides, that's when I'm supposed to travel. What a coincidence! Our trips are on the same date. Do you want to fight me on this? No, not at all. I want to win. But this is about our marriage, our family. That's just great. Then you'll stay here... watching the kids, cleaning the floors. You don't know who you're messing with, Belén. I know damn well. - And you're going to lose. - Am I? The first to reach 1,000 miles gets to leave, dear. How can I calm down? She'll rack up miles like crazy. I know her. She's relentless, a total machine! Calm down and listen. You need to... - Hold on. I think she's coming. - Then hide! Pay close attention. - Are you listening? - Yes. - Okay, listen. - Yes. If Belén is a machine, you'll be one of those Japanese AI robots. Okay. What does that mean? You can't make mistakes. You can't let your guard down. - Be like a soldier. - Okay. - In the Cold War. - Okay. - Pay attention to every detail. - Details, okay. - You can win this. - Yes. - You got this, man! - All right. - You go, tiger! - Yes. - We'll make it to Cancún! - Hell, yeah! Belén. What are you doing? Taking out the trash. - I'll do it. - Oh, no. - Let me help you. - No, I'll do it. - I don't want you to get cold. - I won't. - I want to take it out. - I'll do it.

PLEASING YOUR PARTNER SEXUALLY +30 MILES FAILING TO PLEASE YOUR PARTNER SEXUALLY -30 MILES DOMESTIC SQUABBLE -100 MILES Equilibrium reminds you of our annual Equilibrium Party. It will take place on Saturday. It's a great opportunity to enjoy and earn miles with your partner. I love what we're doing for our marriage. Good night, baby. Good night. Oh, fuck! What are you doing? Just some ironing. - I see it's not something you excel at. - Come on, it's not rocket science. I have practice at eight on Saturday, and I'll probably get to play. That's great, Toto! Congrats. Family is allowed to watch. I thought you might come. Yes. Of course I'll go. - I hope you don't disappoint me this time. - Hey! What do you mean? I'll be there, I promise! Hello. Hello. My name is Elena Pérez. I'm the principal at Micaela's school. - She's your daughter, right? - That's right. Did something happen? Did you think you'd get the miles on your own? Mommy is here. I do want to start by saying Mica is wonderful. She's extroverted, smart. An exemplary student. She gets it from her mother, who's a wonderful person. However, I'm sure you're aware of her new career aspirations... as an influencer, YouTuber... Whatever it is. Is she posting videos? Laurita, show them. Hi, my followers! How are you doing? Today we'll be talking about old people. Not elderly people, just specifically like my parents. They're not that old. I know my mom had me at a young age. Mica, stay on track! Are you recording me? These watches, which we'll call "thingies," assign them points based on how they act around each other. Like if they wash the dishes, leave each other love notes, cook meals for each other, gift each other books, take care of their children. - These thingies give them more miles. - That's enough. She's gained a lot of followers. She's very likeable. She's a hit. I'm sorry, he doesn't get it. I think it's important, that's why I asked you here, to remind you that family affairs should be dealt with... At school. ...at home. At home, of course. Yes. I expect your cooperation on this matter. - Shall they sign now? - Yes. - Mom. - Thanks. Elena, I'll talk to Mica and we'll get this taken care of. Yes, of course. We'll fix this. I'll talk to Mica first. Just so we can be sure that... It would be better if I talked to her, I'm the one who... I'm the disciplinarian. I think it would be better if I talked to her. I'm more persuasive, and I think I'll be able to... I'll take her out of class. We'll fix this in no time. Don't bother. I'll WhatsApp her right now. Stop worrying about the miles. Mica. Do you have a minute? No! What is this? Have you heard of a thing called "privacy"? Well, that's what I want to talk about. We met with your principal today, and she showed us the videos you posted. She's concerned. And so are we. Don't you think you're the ones who are out of line? Maybe. But that doesn't mean you can expose our lives. That's what bothers you. You don't want people to know you're not perfect, and neither is your marriage to Dad. Enough, Micaela. No more videos! You're showing everyone a horrible picture of your family. You're the ones who are horrible. You and your fucking miles. How did it go? Fine. It went badly, huh? - Not at all! - It went terribly. They're at your mom's until things settle down. Okay. She was happy to have them. Was she? It's funny. Before, we would've loved having the house to ourselves. Let's have a truce. Forget about the miles for a while. I would love a truce. I'm so tired of this. - Hi! - Hi. Good to see you. Sorry to show up like this. Don't worry, you're always welcome here. Thank you. - Your house is so nice. - Thanks. My kids are not here. They're at their grandma's. - Are you alone? - No. My husband is here. - Sorry to have come at this hour. - It's not a problem at all. I mean it. Fede, come say hi to Gala. - Hi. - Hello. - Hi there. - I'm Federico. She's friends with Juana. - Yes. - Oh, I see. She has a birthday party and forgot to get a present. - So she came here. - My little cousin. - Sorry to bother you. - Don't worry. What can I get you? I was thinking of the one you showed me the other day, that tiny fox. - Right. - It was a hit last time. Okay. I have an idea. I'll be right back. - Thanks again. - It's nothing. Have a seat. Okay, thanks. I'm sorry again to bother you. No need to be sorry. What a nice romantic dinner! It's nice, right? Just some things I like to cook. - Did you make this? - I did. Really? Wow. I'm actually going on a date right now. I hope I'll get the same treatment. Maybe. Is it your first date? No, it's our third. I'm not too sure I like him yet. I guess I'll know for sure tonight. I see. - Galita... - Yes? See if you like any of these. Check them out. They're beautiful! What are these? A whale and a penguin. - Take this bag. - He'll love it. - Can I have some wine? - Of course. - I already poured you a glass. - How sweet. Thanks so much. Oh, she's picky! Anyway... What happened? Nothing. It's just that... My date cancelled. The dinner is off. Oh, no, that's terrible! The guy you told me about? Yeah, the one I told you about last time. - What will you do now? - Go home, I guess. - What a shame! - I know. Fede... - Stay with us. - No, I'm interrupting... Sure, stay. I don't want to interrupt. It's no problem. Stay, come on. Yes, of course. We have food, we have wine... - Okay. That way I won't go to bed so sad. - Of course! No sadness tonight. - Here. I didn't touch it. - Thanks. Okay, then. Cheers! - To improving your mood. - Thanks! Remember the vineyards on our trip to Patagonia? Oh, yes. Right. - You liked those. - I did! - They were great. - So great. What is it? Do I...? It's just that... You're staring. No, you guys will think I'm out of line. - Why? - No, just tell us. You can say it. Is it okay? It's just that every time I meet a couple, I can't help but imagine them... fucking. I was thinking about that. Oh, I see. Is that right? Have you heard of the compatibility test? Do you see anything? I need to listen. Belén, wow! What is it? You're so fiery! And you're an animal. Sure... Congratulations to both. - Thanks. - I'd never heard of that test. I've never seen such results. Do you do this a lot? Sometimes. Only with couples I like. Like, really like. Oh, so you like us. I do. Gala, can we have a second? Yes, of course. Excuse me, I'll move. - What is it? - Hey... What? - What? - What is with your friend? - What do you mean? - Really? - She's a bit... - Your cologne is lovely! Are you wearing cologne? The one you bought me. I wear it all the time. She's fine. Why do you ask? Are you feeling okay? - Do you need the bathroom? - No. Is it maybe getting a bit...? I don't know, I wonder if we're all in the same... Things are going a bit too far. No, don't worry. Let go. - Are you sure? - Yes. Oh, my God. You naughty boy! Hey! Hey! Whoa! Hey, honey! I want to ask you something. - I lost tons of miles. What about you? - Really? Let's see. - No, I just earned a whole lot! - What? - Is it because I fulfilled your fantasy? - But why am I losing miles? It seems somebody didn't read the handbook. How come? Getting turned on by another woman in front of your wife loses you so many miles! Did you set this up? What is it, Fede? Are you not happy? You got to live your fantasy. An unoriginal one, at that. We said we would have a truce. Come on, let's celebrate! Come here. - You are a traitor! - What? This was about the miles! This doesn't end here. I'll fulfill your fantasy and triple your miles! How? I knew what your fantasy was, but you don't know mine. I'm running late. See you later. I'm going to win! - Take your hand off. - You're not winning! You play dirty! This doesn't end here! She screwed me over. BELÉN: 810 MILES FEDE: 530 MILES She really screwed me. To get your watch replaced, press one. To file a claim on miles, press two. To speak to a representative, press three. Equilibrium, this is Mabel speaking. Hi, Mabel. This is Federico Iribarne. You see, my wife incorrectly earned miles for a ménage à trois. Mr. Iribarne, to analyze your case I'll ask you some questions. Fine. First of all, did the situation involve two men and a woman, or a man and two women? A man and two women. Okay. How long did the event last? About 50 minutes to an hour. An hour and ten minutes. - We'll say an hour and a half, okay? - Okay. All right. Did you use any assortment of items? An ass what? No, I meant items. Sex toys. No, no. Okay, I see. Any sort of talk? What do you mean? You know, dirty talk, naughty things. I didn't, but somebody did call me a fag. Not sure if my wife did, or the other woman. Okay, "fag," I see. Were the participants partially or fully satisfied? Fully. It was really good. Based on what you're saying, sir, it seems that the miles were indeed allotted correctly. No, that's not possible. Maybe I'm not being clear. Either the system malfunctioned, or it's flawed enough to consider I'm the only beneficiary in this event. If there's nothing else, I'll transfer you to a survey. No, don't! You can shove that survey up your ass. This is nuts! It seems that Equilibrium has some pretty heteronormative rules. They say Belén fulfilled your fantasy and you got turned on by someone else. What century is this? You're asking me? It's just a general thought! I can't believe Belén won. Unbelievable. I knew the time would come. No more half-measures. No more cleaning or cooking to get just a few miles. We need something major. Wait, like what? Coming from you, this could be majorly stupid. Don't mock me. You know what? I'll get you a nonstop ticket to Cancún. We already have a ticket and it has a stop in Lima. Two hour layover. But it's a good thing. I love shopping at the duty free. Please, Renato, no interruptions. I didn't read the handbook like Belén did. It's long and the font is tiny. It's not inviting. And I hate reading. But I know one thing, to get lots of miles, you need to become her hero. Federico was right. That is so stupid. Hold on, Reni. I think he has a point. I've been thinking small. If I can do something heroic, I can turn this around. - Do you have a plan? - I don't have a plan. I have the plan. Hi, Fede. What is it? Hi, honey. I'm near the toy store and wanted to come by and chat. No, don't come here. I'm tired, I want to go home. Are you doing it for miles? Not at all. I'm just here and I want to see you. Don't move, I'll be right there. Done. Put that down! It's a fake. I don't care, it's creepy. - Let's go over the plan. - Okay. I go in and rob her. When do you get there? - In fifteen minutes. - What? Fifteen seconds. - Federico, focus! - Yeah. - I'm at your seven. - Huh? It's clock position! - What? - At the corner! - I rob her. What do you do? - I rescue her. I'm scared. I don't think this is a good idea. - It'll all be fine. We're ready. - We got so carried away. Listen, don't be rough with her. Don't even touch her, okay? I'm in character. Hold this. - Fede, go. - Right. Fifteen seconds. - The child lock is on! - What? Young man, will you help me cross the street? - I can't, sorry. - What? I'm in a hurry. I need help, I'm an elderly woman! Not my problem. Help me, you asshole! - Hand over your bag! - I don't have any money. Here. Hurry! What else do you have? Hand over your phone. - Let's hurry. - Hurry my ass, do you want me to fall? - I have a gun! - I know. - Then come on. - Put the gun down, man. - What else you got? Don't lie. - Nothing. I was just visiting my cousin Susana, you know? Give me your bracelet! Here you go. - Put the gun down. - Come on! Hurry up! - No more talking, please. - Excuse me? You want more? Here! I'm blind! Should we get a glass of whiskey? You have beautiful eyes! Stop that! - Police! - Stop! Police! There's a thief! - Let's go have a gin! - There you go. What happened, honey? I got mugged. You got mugged? This guy took my purse, my phone. My bracelet too. - Did he hurt you? - No. - I'll get him. Which way did he go? - That way. - But don't go! He had a gun. - Of course I'll go! - I'll kill him! - He had a gun, don't go! I'm sorry, officer! I had nothing to do with it. I'm a friend! No, it's me, dude. Give me her things. - What took you so long? - Something came up. What did you take? Give me everything. I'm going to go blind! No way! Gonza, you'll be fine, relax. Just put some water in it. I just wanted to go to Cancún. We're going to go. - We are? - I promise. Look at me. - Can you see me? - Yes. I promise we're going. We are. Let me go. Let me go, Gonza! It's over. - It's over. - Are you okay? I'm glad you're okay. - I love you, honey. I do. - Me too. He hit me here, then again here... and that was it. I took it like a champ, okay? I needed to get your mom's stuff. It was important. You always say that if someone mugs you, you hand over everything and let them go. True, you do say that. That's right. And I mean that. But tonight I got carried away by my instincts and the agony your mother was in. But you should never try it. Let's make that clear, okay? Let's see those smiles. Did you get it? Good. Thanks, go right in. Welcome. Those are some nice smiles! Arms around each other. - Belén, Fede. - Hello. - Thanks for coming. - Our pleasure. - This way. - Thanks. Let's take a picture. Smile. - Look at the camera. - Okay. Do I have the prettiest wife or what? Of course you do. Enjoy, smile, hold each other! There you go. This way, go straight here. Good. Enjoy your night, be happy, and don't go too far. It'll start any minute. Okay, thanks. Okay. - I'll hit the men's room. - Okay. Almost there. Toto, is everything okay? I knew you'd forget. - Forget what? - My basketball debut. I'm sorry, son. Your Mom and I had plans and... But I promise I'll be there next time. Enough with the promises, Dad. Come on, you know I... Fancy a drink, sir? Sure, okay. Why are you here? - Why are you here? - I'm working. The pepper spray really messed me up. I put some chamomile tea in it, I got better and I came. What a coincidence! What? What is wrong with you? - I'm serious. - What? We're at Equilibrium! The marriage app! We've been talking about it for weeks. - You don't know your catering clients? - It didn't cross my mind. Equilibrium... - Right. - Why are you doing this? I'm doomed if she recognizes you. - Who? - Belén! She won't. She never saw my face, don't panic. But your eyes! You have piercing eyes! - Really? - Yes! I'm so flattered. What? Don't be! She can recognize your eyes. If you see her, look down. - And change your voice. - Trust me. - Trust you? - Fede! Hi, honey. - How are you? - Good. You know each other? - Yes. - No. Right, yes. You know who this is? Gonza. Gonza and Reni are the guys I cook with on Tuesdays. - Right, Gonza! - Such a coincidence. - You said he makes great drinks. - Yes, exactly. How are you doing? I'm fine. I would love to try one of your drinks. Will you make me one today? Sure, okay. Bye, Gonza. See you later. Is he okay? - He just had surgery. - Really? - He had throat surgery. - No way. Welcome to all of you, you lovers of balance and love. I'm so glad to see you here, at the annual Equilibrium Party! Thanks. Tonight, we want to celebrate how far our couples have come. Celebrate your accomplishments and efforts. On that note, we'd like to give out some awards. The first one is for a couple who have reached their first 30 days optimizing their use of the system and winning an equitable number of miles in record time. Isn't that right, Olson? Let's have a round of applause for Belén Correas and Federico Iribarne. Congratulations to you. Come on up. Come and get your award. Give it up for them, please. Tell us about your experience. Well, I... I'm nervous up on the stage. We've never received an award and we... Let's get them some champagne. Their hands are empty. Waiter? Waiter? Come here. Waiter! Champagne, please. Let's drink some champagne. Let's celebrate. We need something so we can let loose. No champagne, please. That's quite... Hand over your bag! I have a gun! Well, okay. We want to thank Equilibrium and everybody involved in making this possible. - And I... - Your friend mugged me! Gonza? No, that's not possible. No way. Sorry, guys. I lost my train of thought. - The people at Equilibrium. - It was all fake. What was fake? We'll talk later. You went through all that just to get fucking miles! No, no. You're wrong. We'll talk about this later. Well, I... Hold on, Belén! Excuse me. Belén! Belén! Belén, wait! Can I please explain? Explain what? You had me mugged to get miles so you could travel with your friends? I admit I got carried away. - Carried away? He pointed a gun at me! - It was a toy gun. I didn't know that. Well, you cheated too. What are you talking about? The threesome? Yes. That never happened. Gala laced your drink and you fell asleep. I went through an awful experience, and it was because of you. Is the trip to Mexico that important to you? It's not about Mexico. I want to do things on my own and not feel guilt. Everything I do, unless it's work or family stuff, makes me feel guilt. I want to get away too sometimes. You've been away for a long time. PLANET MICA Didn't see you there. Come here. I miss Dad. Hi, sweetie. I want to apologize to you. Lately I've been a complete jackass. I appreciate your mea culpa. When do you play next? At our end of year game. I'm sure there's a draft. I see. Okay. We can come practice here whenever you want. And on the day of the game, we'll get here early and just practice, okay? You won't be here, you'll be in Cancún. I'm not going. I'll be here, this is more important. I'll be at that game and every game after. Statistically, it's unlikely I'll be leaving the bench. Then let's make you the best player on the bench. Maybe you'll get an award for that. I love you so much, son. Dad. I really think you should see a therapist. I know. Wow, that is beautiful! Just something I'm trying out. Drawing helps when I'm feeling sad. Then you should feel sad more often. Are you making new samples? Maybe, I don't know. What about our trip? Do I need to buy a bindi yet? I don't think so. Bummer. I'd like to stock more of my original designs at Bimba. Better quality toys. What do you think? This is the friend I went into business with. Let's go for it. Schedule a meeting at the factory. At your service. Hi. I came for some stuff and I took the liberty of making dinner. I figured you'd come home late, and it'd be helpful. Was I wrong? - No. - Really? - Good. - I appreciate it. Are you hungry? - I am. - Really? Sit down. - Okay. - I'll get you a plate. Thank you. That yellow thing is called shazai shimasu. It's Japanese for: "I apologize for being an idiot for so long." Something like that. Why didn't you just tell me you wanted to go on a trip? I'm not good at talking. I suck at expressing myself. You needn't ask for my permission to do things, you know? I know. But it's over. I mean it. I learned my lesson. Let's just move on. I don't know, maybe I... I didn't give you space to... to talk to me. We just need to let this go. It's done, I get it now. Look, why don't we... Let's just open a nice wine, have a toast... Fede... What? What? It's over. I love it! Go on, that way. Let's see. Mom, what are you doing? Uploading a story. Don't you dare tag me! SUPERBAO Done! Enjoy. MENU GUA BAO, COD BAO EXCLUSIVE DESIGNS Bravo! Look! No way! Oh, wow. We're a hit! Girl! How do I look? Nervous? No, I mean physically. You don't look so good. Try and smile a bit. Thanks. The Martians take on the Eagles in this highly anticipated game. TOTO Look, that's Toto! - Right there, do you see him? - Yes, Dad. Relax. He looks good down there. Like you when you were a child. No, Toto is a lot handsomer. True. Stop that, Dad. You look desperate. There she is. Pass the ball. There's Toto. MARTIANS That wave was so lame, Dad. Well, thanks, Mica. Go, guys! - Toto! - Go! You got this, Toto! Toto, Toto! Show them what you're made of! Shoot! It's fine, Toto. Shake it off! Let's go, Martians! It's just a bit further. Okay. How are you? Fine. I thought you'd decline my invitation. Why? You said the magic words, "Free Asian food." Free? I never said "free." Will you charge me? Yes. Sorry. I can give you a discount if you pay cash. Well, lucky me! Sorry. I'm starting out. I can't give free food to just anyone. - Anyone? - Right. - Okay. - I'm sorry. Are we not going to mention the elephant in the room? No, of course we will. Sure. Is it possible Toto isn't good at basketball? He sucks, right? Even I could do better. No, come on. You'd be much worse. You'd be significantly worse. You're the least sporty person I've ever met. How nice. I'm learning to express myself. Belén Correas. Nice to meet you. Federico Iribarne. Professional chef. Well, I just love chefs. Will he be okay? Of course, don't worry. I take this when I fly. He'll wake up in about five hours. Hand me your lipstick. Subtitle translation by:
