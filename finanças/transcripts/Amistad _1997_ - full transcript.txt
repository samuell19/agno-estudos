1839 That one wants us to sail them back. That one thinks he can sail all the way back without us. Yes. East. To the sun. I understand. You can trust me. To Africa. Well, I have to tack, don't I? Tack. You'd rather I didn't. You want to get there? I have to tack. You're going to get us killed. Yea, yea, yea, now go take a bath. We have to signal them. When the ship gets close, he'll run and hide. Then we both start yelling. They'll search the ship. Get ready. Six Weeks Isabella II, Queen of Spain Your Royal Highness. Something's happened. Martin Van Buren, 8th President of the United States Chief! Chief! Chief! He's not a chief. Brother! Brother! He's not your brother. What is he then? He's a white man. U.S. Secretary of State John Forsyth Who are they, do you think? Looks like they're going to be sick. They're entertainers. ...but why do they look so miserable? You don't belong here. Your table doesn't belong here. This is Temne land. You want to sit? Sit over here in Mendeland. What are you doing, Temne? You want trouble? Cross into our territory again. What is this? Get this table out of here. Let me show you to Sherbroland. What do you want? I could kill you with my bare hands before you raise that sword shoulder high. What did he say? I didn't understand a word of it. It's gibberish. What do you think? Is he here to help us? Or? I don't know. He reminds me of that Fula of Baoma, you know the one-- ...who hires himself out to scrape elephant dung from the crop rows. A dung-scraper might be just the kind of man we need right now. What does he want? He's an idiot. He just likes to hear himself speak. Were you born in the West Indies? All three of them are idiots. Look, it's those miserable-looking people again. I'm not afraid of you, or your medicine. Have you figured out who he is? An advisor of some kind. Maybe theirs. What about him? Theirs maybe. And Dung-Scraper? I have a horrible feeling he talks for us. You want to show them where we're from. How can I explain to you where we're from? Maybe, I - I'm sorry, you should talk first. That's here. This... This... is how far I've come. My name is Kai Nyagua...\N\N\N My name is Kai Nyagua... and James Covey. I speak Mende and English - his language. You and he will talk to each other through me. The clothes? And the names. I was rescued off a slave ship by the British Navy. I never went back. I'll hit you in the head again if you talk. I'll share the profit of my harvest. I'll give you all of it if you - Lomboko Slave Fortress This one's sick, don't give him any. Her. Not her. Her. Havana, Cuba You don't have to pretend to be interested in that. Nobody's watching but me. I'm not pretending. I'm beginning to understand it. Their people have suffered more than ours... Their lives were full of suffering. Then he was born and everything changed. Who is he? I don't know, but everywhere he goes, he is followed by the sun. Here he is healing people with his hands. Protecting them... Being given children... What's this? He could also walk across the sea. But then something happened... He was captured. Accused of some crime. Here he is with his hands tied. He must have done something. Why? What did we do? Whatever it was, it was serious enough to kill him for it. Do you want to see how they killed him? This is just a story, Yamba. But look. That's not the end of it. His people took his body down from this...thing...this... They took him into a cave. They wrapped him in a cloth, like we do. They thought he was dead, but he appeared before his people again...and spoke to them. Then, finally, he rose into the sky. This is where the soul goes when you die here. This is where we're going when they kill us. It doesn't look so bad. Buakei...Hold your head up. What kind of place is this? Where you almost mean what you say? Where laws almost work? How can you live like that? Is he going to help? He has far many more questions than answers.
