Listen to this, Hank. UGlobal Food Company triumphed again in court last week in its latest case against a small farmer accused of failing to pay royalty on crops grown using UGlobal's patented seeds. Buck Thompson, a local Hoxton farmer, lost his lengthy legal battle with UGlobal Foods over his use of UGlobal's patented soybean seeds. Thompson was sued by the giant agricultural company for failure to pay royalties on his crops grown with the seeds. UGlobal Food cannot disprove Thompson's defense that he had never bought any of the agricultural giant's seeds. And the company had no proof that he had. But laboratory tests confirmed that a portion of his crops came from the seeds, leaving the judge no choice but to issue a directed verdict against the long-time Hoxton farmer. And what's next? I have to serve him his eviction papers. Easier from a friend, I hope. When's it going to be? A couple of weeks, I guess. Hell. What's the world coming to? I'll see ya. Daddy bear? Daddy bear? Here's my Daddy bear. I love you. I love you too, Maisie May. Daddy bear, there's a man on the phone who wants to talk to you. Okay, sweetie, thank you. That was Hank. They're coming this afternoon with the eviction papers, at two. But... Maisie's party is this afternoon. I know it is. Look, I'll deal with it and send them on their way. She'll never know. Hello. Hello, sweetheart. Hello, honey, happy birthday. We brought you a surprise. Happy birthday. - Louise. - Thank you. It's beautiful. But you can't give Maisie something so elegant. She's just a little girl. -Yes, she should. -And I have, so there. Gil bought it for me when we found out we couldn't. Yeah. Anyway, it's yours. Thank you. - We love you. - We love you too. Go play. Come on. Look at that. Itchy, can you give up that ball long enough to have some cake? Hell, they're right on time. Just take it easy. Don't let 'em get you stirred up. Maisie, you have a haul. Look at this. He's got that fat lawyer with him. I... had it you wanted to send one of the younger guys. They ain't known you your whole life like I have. It didn't seem right. I--God, Buck. I hate that this turned out like this. I appreciate your calling first. Right in the middle of a little girl's birthday. 'Cause of you? You make me sick. All of you make me sick. Big company assholes. It's hot. Thompson, you had a chance to settle. And you didn't. You no longer make decisions about this land. This now belongs to UGlobal. We make the decisions now. I make 'em. You got two weeks to be off this land. I come back and find a single trace. He knows what the court order says. Get back in the vehicle. Now, Mr. Gandy. It's okay. Happy birthday, little girl. I bet this is one you'll never forget. Hey. What did you say? I said, "Happy--" Somebody get a doctor. Get off of me. Kinsey to County. Ambulance, Thompson place. You listen to me, farmer boy. Farmer boy! Your suffering hasn't even begun. Hasn't even begun! Inbound with adult male. Catastrophic injury to left eye, occipital ridge, cheek bone. Patient going into shock. ETA 20 minutes.

Then lots of hot new guys who just moved here with their rich parents are going to be coming over to stare at us and try to get us to go driving around in their new fancy foreign cars. We may come home. We may not. Yeah. That is how we work. So nothing. No. You know, I hate the weekends when there's no game. It makes for a long, long week. There's nothing to look forward to. It's just-- I know. So little hope. - Yeah. - So little reason to soldier on. Have you ever considered accepting Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior? You know, I think I'd rather create massive uncountable wealth by making really awesome blue crystal meth, killing all who get in my way, and letting to money pile so high that I can buy...

Mom, how long is he going to keep talking like Walter White? Until Downton Abbey picks up. Then he'll become Mr. Carson. That's a vehicle. Yeah, that's a vehicle. Damn. Yes. Yeah. Let us pray. Clint, I wish I hadn't known you all my life. What? Then I'd let you get at me a little on the back of that monster. Except it'd be like incest. Well, a lot of people who've known each other -their whole lives-- -Nah, don't even go there. You're like a brother to me. It really creeps me out. Man, what a truck. Yeah. -Friends. -For life. -In fun. -And strife. Six pals in Hoxton. Livin' the life.

Amen. Cheers. Hello. I'm staying. What? I'm not going to college. What? I know I'm in automatically 'cause of my grades. But I'm not going. I'm staying right here in Hoxton. Maisie, that's not going to happen. You're leaving with the rest of us. Nobody stays here, nobody. Maisie, come on, you of all people know that you're just-- All right, listen, Jesse, you are a quarter Mexican and three quarters Neanderthal. So going off and doing the Marines, that's going to be perfect for you. Itchy, you are 100% full-blooded Neanderthal, have been since we were kids. So you're going to end up being a big college football star and then make a ton of money in the pros. Lawton, you're going to go to Princeton and do whatever smart people stuff it is that people at Princeton do. And Clint, you're set 'cause you got all that money your dad gets from the government for not growing anything. And Kat, you're going to college and become this Theta Omega Googa and marry the hottest guy on campus, have three perfect kids, okay? And then there's me, you know? My mom is an alcoholic who can barely dress herself. My brother is a mute, walks around in a robot costume made out of boxes. And for the win, my dad's in prison. I've got it all going on. Look, I know I don't have much left here, except for you five. And y'all are leaving. And I know I should get on with it. But... I can't stand the thought of leaving. Too many people been too good to me. Miss Katherine. Pretty Maisie. Clint, Jesse, Lawton, Itchy. One of you fellas hand me a cold beer, would you? Yeah, we got plenty, Mr. Denton. Yeah, I can see you do. Dang, that was good. I was really thirsty. Well, I owe ya. I suppose you'll all be here again tomorrow night, as always. -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. -Yep. Idle hands are the devil's workshop, and all that business. No game tonight. God, I hate it when there's no game. See y'all. All right, now can someone please explain to me why I'm only three quarters Neanderthal. And what the hell makes Itchy here a whole one? All right, that's bullshit, man. That's bullshit, I don't really appreciate that, I don't. All right, you need to calm down. - My God. - What is wrong with you? I still remember how many flowers there were at Mrs. Denton's funeral, and how worried my Dad was that his eulogy wasn't going to be good enough. I remember as we were leaving, Mr. Denton reached over and touched the edge of her coffin so gently, like he was touching her. I was so sad. I can't believe one of the widows hasn't grabbed him yet. It's been three months. Mom says they usually wait a week out of respect and then they pour it on with the casseroles and chicken spaghetti. He's got all that money too. What difference does it make if you've got any money in this town? I mean, what are you going to spend it on? You don't need much to live like a king here. You got to stop talking like that. You're going to screw me up in the head. I'll wind up marrying someone who wants to go camping or something. Your brother? Same as always, in his own world. Your mom? You know how she is. Why even ask? You give them both my love. I always do. I haven't told Buckie you're getting out in April. He doesn't respond too much in general these days. And if he does, he doesn't talk to me about it, or anyone else as far as I know. You keep an eye on him for me, Maisie. How are your friends? Same. Clint got a new truck. Duh. And Mr. Denton joined us while we were drinking beer on Main Street last night. He seems real lonely. I guess he is. It hasn't been that long. He's going to help me when I get out. What? I got a letter from him earlier this week. What'd it say? Classic Gil Denton. "Buck, I want you to take over my operation when you get out." Dad, my God, my God. Are you serious? My God, this is the best news ever. I'm going to start looking for a house. I'm going to start looking. And it's going to be just like it was-- No, no, no, no, no, Maisie. Nothing is ever going to be like it was before. Nothing is ever even going to be like how we remember it. You're going off to college and getting a new start. And you have to go. I won't be able to do much but work and try to get some money saved up. I want to take care of your mom. And we need to get little Buckie some help. Maybe it'll work out and maybe it won't. But I'll be an ex-con. And you need to get a new start in a fresh place... where you're not my daughter. Dad, you are Buck Thompson. You hammered a UGlobal Food lawyer. You're like our King Carter. Except you did it and he didn't. But anyway, you know what I mean. The point is, you're like a cult hero. You know, you should have your own website. I bet if you were on Facebook you'd get like a jillion likes, and you'd rule Instagram. Hey, Maisie. Buck, time's almost up. You're my hero, Dad. You're my precious angel. I love you, Daddy bear.

I want you to see this. I'm sitting in my yard swaying out here in the tiny town of Hoxton, and I'm reading this morning's edition of the New York Timeson this device that I have no idea how in the world it works. And then I'm going to read a British newspaper and it's going to hone my worldly and polished ways. And then I'll go to sports. And after that, I'm going to follow the weather all across this great land of ours. All on this little device. How can that be possible, this little gizmo holding all that information? Of course, I don't even understand how a radio works. And air conditioning puzzles me if I kind of let my mind wander a little bit. Television, I got no idea about that. Magnets. The list goes on, and on, and on. And then this thing. You have no idea what this world was like when I was your age. We used to talk to each other face to face. We'd write letters on paper with ink pens. We did our own cooking. We would... We only had two kinds of gasoline. We had regular and ethyl, that was it. And then in the evening we would sit on the porch and visit with our neighbors. Did you have to hit Mrs. Denton over the head with a club and drag her into the house too? On occasion. Have you seen your mama this week? Yes, sir. How's your daddy doing today? Finally, thank God. He's good. He told me what you're going to do for him when he gets out. You can't believe anything that they say in prison. You know those criminals are always just after attention. Mr. Denton, I-- You don't know what this means. You don't-- It means he's going to be okay. It means I'm going to be okay. It means we're going to be all right, and I-- Ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh. Okay. You know-- Your daddy... destroyed a UGlobal lawyer with one blow. He hit him and he took him out. Now, with what these big corporations are trying to do to us now, to have one man have the courage to stand up to the representative of one of those things and take him out... I mean, that restores my faith in human nature. It strengthened my faith in God. And I cannot imagine a person that I'd rather have running my operation than your dad. That's the truth. We'll be on Main Street tonight. There'll be lots of cold beer. I hope I see you there. I'll be there. And cookies, I brought you cookies. Well, I wouldn't ignore them. That'd be my supper. Mr. Denton... All the guys want to grow up to be just like you. Well I can't think of a better aspiration for a young fella. I hope he can hold it together to become a tired old man. I don't blame 'em, I really don't. Hey, Lawton, what's up? Hey. Is Kat up yet? Please. Kat, get up, Lawton's here! Mom wants to interview us for the paper. She wants to talk about how the six of us have been best friends since we were kids and some of the cool things we've done so far. Like Mr. Hoxton High, National Merit Scholar, Division One football scholarship, and you know, Marine. As well as the two head cheerleaders that are class president and class favorite. So it's like, mainly about me and Maisie, right? It's mainly about the six of us. Whatever. She wants to talk about how you've dealt with your dad being in prison, if that's okay to talk about. What? You want to let everybody know my dad's in prison? Wait till this gets out. I'll be ruined. She, look, she can leave it out if you want her to. She just wanted me to ask. You know, she thought she ought to talk about how you've been able to do so much despite that, and all that. It's okay, I know. Did anyone ever tell you you're like, super serious? Ninth grade's when I guess I got pretty good at football. But I just figured I was quicker and that's all. Then my sophomore year when all the scouts started watching me my parents said that, you know, maybe they knew something. And now that I'm going off to college to play, I guess I'll find out if I'm the stud horse they keep telling me I am. Wouldn't that be something if one day you play professional football? I hope I do. I'd like to be the first guy from Hoxton to make it in the pros. - I - bet a lot of people would come to the Mexican restaurant and the bowling alley just to say they'd been there. I bet every family in the area would want to be buried by your family's funeral home. Well, I'd like to think that we wouldn't have to keep all three of those. I'd like to be able to help my parents so they wouldn't have to work so much. I hope you don't close the restaurant. I love that guacamole. And better not close that bowling alley. I ain't driving to Maston to bowl. I guess the main thing is I'll always be a Hoxton boy in my heart, even if I live somewhere else. You'd have to live someplace else if you play professional football. Yeah, I know that. I might even wind up having to stay somewhere afterwards for a while, like lots of guys do. But I guess if I had my dreams come true I'd do well in college, get drafted, play in the pros, then come back here and coach our team. That'd be cool. And Coach would probably be about ready to retire by that time. It'd sure be nice to have somebody over there coaching that would listen to me. Tommy, we're up here on the porch. Montecristo No. 4s, from the motherland. Look at this. Tobacco contraband. I hope we don't all wind up in the penitentiary. Oo-ee. Tommy... Gil has cancer. It's a rare form of bone cancer, but it's serious. Doctors in Houston diagnosed it, and... I'm going to do what I can for the pain. But if we don't catch a break, he's got about a year. You're the only other person that knows about this, okay? Okay. Tommy, I invited Kline here to explain this to you because he's my doctor, and you, you're my brother in law. At least, you were my brother in law until Louise, well. Well... That meant I still think of you as my brother in law. Right, yeah. Now, I want you to be the executor of my estate, make sure all the transition goes smoothly when Buck gets out of prison and it's time for him to take over if I'm already, you know. But any questions that you might have of a medical nature, or anything else, just feel free to ask either one of us. Can I have your golf clubs? Golf clubs. Damn, Tommy. Golf clubs. Yes, Mom. I remember what all I'm supposed to talk about. I never thought I'd get into Princeton, not really. I applied because I thought it'd be cool to go to an Ivy League school. They told me that they've never ever had anyone from Hoxton before, so I'm proud of that. You're proud of that? Your dad and I are so proud of you, sweetie. I always knew you could do anything you wanted to do. Okay, Mom, thanks. Please. I think I got a good education here in Hoxton. I was taught good values, hard work, honesty. I think Princeton liked that. And my test scores. Dad said too that he wishes he had gone somewhere else for college, so I also did it for him. Maybe we could practice law together one day, if I go to law school. My God, Lawton, that would just be perfect. We would both be tickled pink. But I don't know if I want to come back here, Mom. And I don't want to be pressured. I hate it when you pressure me like that. Anyway... I think being from Hoxton made me stand out. 'Cause I was probably a little more normal than some of the other kids who want to go up there. And I'll come out normal too. I won't be some radical East Coast kid. I-- I won't come out with a lot of weird ideas. And I won't be one of those people who only cares about the money and acting like a big shot, and all that. I'll still be one of us. Lord. Kline, I can barely stand up on my own now. The pain pills are all right, but I don't know. A man's no good alone, Kline. You know that. The only person I want to be with now is Louise, and she's not here. So I'm ready to follow God's timetable. And it's-- It's time. Without the chemo you may last a year, but the end is going to be miserable. Just-- Just do the damn chemo and let's see what happens. Do it for me and Tommy. Do it for Buck. Do it for Maisie. Damn it, Kline, that's not fair. You know I'd cut off my right arm for that girl. All right. I'm going to pick you up at nine. We'll go to the medical center. I'll have you back by supper time, you hear me? Okay, I'll do it. But I want that to be powerful stuff. - I want it to pack a wallop. - Okay. If I take a piss outdoors I want it to kill every flea on every dog between here and Denbury, you hear me? See, I'm not a big one on paying for something to make me puke my guts out every morning and have it not do any good. That's just me though. Now hear me out. There are things you can do now to ease that issue, like anti-nausea medication's pretty good. And there's some non-traditional alternatives. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Now I ain't going to take yoga. I'm not referring to yoga. I'm talking about marijuana. I'm not some damn musician. And I don't relish the idea of spending my last days in the penitentiary. What in the hell is the matter with you, Kline? Nothing. It helped me when I was getting over that foot surgery. My best friend, a damn dope fiend. What-- What's it like? You'll like it. I guarantee it, okay? Well, it ain't going to turn me into Charles Manson, is it? He was a family man.

If I start thrashing around or pulling my clothes off, you all gotta promise to stop me. It he's naked and starts thrashing around, I'm gonna have to let you take over. Good practice today. Yep. Hey man, sorry about that hit on the last sweep. I just-- I'm still just so pissed about Ashley breaking up with me. And apparently she's been going out with this new guy from Maston all places. And I was just dwelling on it and it made me go psycho. No wait, that last play? Where I ran it all the way, you hit me? Yeah, I did. Douche. Hey man. You know, that guy's got a lot of nerve. A guy from Maston going after one of our women. Right. -Yeah. -Wait, who is he? Wilkins, their pussy quarterback. Apparently he's real smart, he's got a whole lot of money. He's this big jock, so they all decided to make him president of their sorry senior class. Captain of their bullshit football team. Captain of their chickenshit basketball team. And all-star pitcher of their half-assed baseball team. Wait, is this the same teams that beat our asses last year? -Well. -Yeah. Well-- I'm just saying, I am our goddamn middle linebacker. - Damn right. - I'm one of the most dependable basketball players. Yep, yep, yep.

You know we're messing. -Come on. -Come on. ♪ Never be like that ♪ Well... my family's been farming here for over 100 years. So I like to think that's pretty cool. But they don't farm anymore. Well it's more profitable to not farm sometimes, take the deal from the government. But I really don't know anything about this. I mean, it doesn't make much sense to me. But anyways, I'll either stay here, learn the family business, or I'm off to college. What? You might stay here? Lawton never told me that. Well, I doubt it. See, this is how I live my life. Every day that goes by that I'm not learning about my dad's business is a day that I'll never get back. And, you know, I don't like to let things slip away. So, that's why I'll be happy to be voted Mr. Hoxton High. So, so you're proud of being Mr. Hoxton High? Yes, ma'am. I hope to always uphold the things the honor stands for. I think my mom would be proud of me. Clint, she's up there smiling down on you right now. Yeah, I like to think so. I know so. And she always will be, you know that. So, what are those things, Clint, the ones that mean the most to you? Well-- I don't think I know what they are. Maybe they forgot to tell me. I just-- I just know I believe in 'em and I always will. Robert Buckner Thompson, you have served almost all of your ten-year sentence. You're scheduled for release April 30th of next year. Yes, sir. Your actions had such terrible consequences. Although your victim sustained his most serious injuries when he fell, it was your attack that set events in motion. Had it not been for the quick actions of the sheriff, sheriff... Sheriff Kinsey, you'd most likely be serving a term for murder instead of attempted murder. Now we have reviewed your case and reports from the officials of this prison. Early release is denied. You'll serve out your full sentence until April 30th of next year. Yes, sir. Ten years. Ten years, my God. I'm eight when he goes away. He misses seeing everything. Even though he was locked up in that joint he was still there for you... talking to you... listening. He was a good dad to you. I get so mad at him sometimes, doing what he did. For being locked up, for being away from all of us for so long. A man can only take so much before he snaps. Your dad worked that land for ten years by himself... improving it, making it better than what he inherited. And all of a sudden he's sued... for raising a crop that he didn't plant. And unlike all these other people, he... he refused to cave in to the... piss poor settlement offer that UGlobal made... and decided to fight 'em. He couldn't win. This country's being run by big corporations, big politicians, big business. All this about the little man, small farmer... It's just so much finely sifted... horseshit. Your dad, me... a few others like us... we're the old way, on our way out. Some day the teachers in school will be talking about how the small farmer raised his family... fed 'em on crops from his own farm, and sold the surplus. And it will seem as amusing to those kids as when I talk to you about black and white television. Thanks for helping me get through all this. I know it was you who helped out me and Buckie. I know it was you who tried to help my mom. My dad told me. I told you not to listen to what you hear in prison. Your dad's a violent criminal, not to be trusted. I know. I brought you some more of those oatmeal raisin cookies. I'm a leave them in the kitchen, all right? I'll eat 'em all in one sitting tonight. ♪ Find your place and stay ♪ ♪ Face turned away ♪ ♪ From everything That's passed ♪ ♪ And not yet come ♪ ♪ Close your eyes and see ♪ ♪ Things might not be ♪ ♪ The way you always thought ♪ ♪ But hey, it's not your fault ♪ ♪ There are days When you're running free ♪ ♪ There are weeks When you're quickly fading ♪ ♪ There are hours when You've nothing left to say ♪ It's a cool 55 degrees, but it's a miserable night here in Hoxton. The Warriors, they lost a tough battle to bitter rival, Maston. And they lost on just a terrible call by the refs who basically gave the game to Maston, stealing a game from Hoxton and ruining the senior year of a bunch of great kids who don't deserve to have their life's dreams crushed by a group of zebras clearly, clearly bought and paid for by someone who doesn't give a damn about good sportsmanship. No other news is worth talking about. I can't believe I just played my last game of football for Hoxton. I can't stand that we lost our last game. Man, that was the dirtiest team I have ever played against. Last game at Hoxton, my best friends... drinking beer on Main Street. I can start crying pretty easily, or write a country and western song. I don't know what that other team did to y'all on that field tonight. Well, at least they didn't waterboard ya. Yeah, well that's the only thing they didn't do to us. No, I'm good. You ought to be happy they don't eat the dead. Well, I guess there's more important things than caring about what your football team does. But not here in Hoxton, not any other small town. Somewhere, I reckon. You all... cherish these moments... 'cause one day down the road... you're going to wish you had thousands of other Fridays that you could sit and have a beer with your friends, shoot the breeze and... Good night, y'all. Mr. Denton's dying. Wait, what? Where'd you hear that? No, no, that can't be right. He was just at the game. He looked fine. Look, I saw his chemo schedule on his refrigerator door. Don't say shit like that. That must be why he's hiring my dad. He spends a lot of time out on the porch now. I can see him from the highway every time I drive by, no matter what time. He's just out there smoking his pipe. Shit. That must be it. My mom said every lady in town's been trying to get him to come over for dinner, but he turns them all down. Look, I'm not supposed to know. If he wants to tell anyone, he can. But we can't, okay? My granddad was a Marine and my dad was a Marine. And, of course, he's a sheriff. And I'm going to be a Marine. And I'll tell you, that's not because that's what's expected of me. No. That's because that's what I want. So if you look at the news you'll see they're always listing the names of the different guys that were killed in action. It's usually small town guys. I think that small town guys love this country more. And I think they love it because of their hometowns. I think that's the reason they sign up. And I think if they were, you know, all from some big city, I don't know if they'd love their country as much as they do. That's so sweet, Jesse. My goodness. Thank you, thank you. Are you okay? I'm real sorry about your, you know, cancer. It's okay. Don't you worry about that. I'm fighting it. Yeah, well. It sure seems to be going around. Man, I love my country so much. I love it so much, I really do. I think I made that pretty obvious. So, you know, if I'm-- If I'm stuck up in some lousy place, right? And I'm getting shot at, I'm going to be doing it because I love my country. And even more than that, I'm going to be doing that because I love Hoxton, and because I love my friends and my family here. And because they are something that's really worth fighting for. Plus, you know, us Mexicans are real ass kickers too. Yeah, excuse my language. But you're just one quarter Mexican, Jesse. Hey okay, even a quarter Mexican is still enough to kick most people's asses. Look, we made tequila out of a cactus. You don't jack with somebody that does something like that, I'm just saying. Happy, happy New Year to everyone on this cold and frosty night. Now you need to drive carefully because drinking and driving doesn't end well. Well, unless you have a good lawyer or you're related to the cop that pulls you over. Slow down. My God, not so fast please. Wow. You promised me you'd look in on her every week. What's the point, Dad? Seriously, what's the point? She's never once been awake when I've come by there. Don't go by so early. Dad, she is a drunk, okay? She's a drunk. She doesn't wake up for anything. Maisie, please don't talk that way about your mother. Dad, you're the one that's been there for me, not her. Honey, it is not her fault. It's my fault she's like this. I could have given up. I could have. It would have been real easy for me to just leave, or give up, or whatever. But I didn't, and I stayed around. I took care of Buckie when she started drinking. And I have been here every visitors day for the last ten years. I don't expect you to understand everything at your young age. I sure didn't. I'm pretty grown up, Dad. You're smarter than I was. All of ya are. But that doesn't make you any wiser. I go to bed every night knowing my family is split up and suffering. I could blame that lawsuit and be bitter the rest of my life. I could blame my hot temper and never forgive myself for going after Gandy. Or I could take it like a piece of bad luck... and work through it and let it go. Which is what I aim to do. I was never a threat to anyone. I was a farmer. I was just a farmer. How was your Dad? Still the best guy I know. Yeah. Was he hung-over? He's in prison. They don't party much, so he never has a hangover. Well, he's got that going for him. Which is nice. Here, drink it. You gotta take it. Come on. You watch it. ♪ Days grow shorter As the months go by ♪ ♪ Summer and the autumn skies ♪ Talked to that doctor in Houston. What? Told him to hit me with everything he had. He said it might kill me. I said, so be it. Buck's going to be taking over this place pretty soon. There's a lot of things that I want to get done. This cancer may kill me, but it's going to take a hell of a licking doing it. I'm going to fight it. Maisie's taking too good a care of me... for me to say goodbye to her now. I'm worried about you getting weak... all this nausea. - How much weed is that? - All of it. Kat. It's an interview for the newspaper. It's not a video. I know. I knew that. I mean, duh. So, what does it mean to be from Hoxton? What does it mean to be head cheerleader at Hoxton High School, home of the Warriors? I have thought about it. And I'll tell you what it means. It means... It means... It means a lot. And I mean that. It means a lot. That's four words. Can you think of more things to say about what it means to be from Hoxton and to be head cheerleader, and all of that? So far all you've said is those four words. I've never known you to only say four words. More? Yes, more. In case it goes into a time capsule, or gets discovered by archeologists thousands of years from now. Okay, wow, I hadn't thought about that. Um-- Okay. Well... It means I got to grow up with some of the best people in the world. It means I got to grow up with the best guys I'll ever know. And I got to grow up with Maisie, who's... the best friend anyone could ever ask for. And I know that... no matter what happens to me, or... where I end up, or who I wind up with... if there's anything in me that will make people like me or want to get to know me... it'll be because I'm from Hoxton. And no one else could ever understand that because... no one else's hometown is as great as ours is. They may think it is, but it's not. Hey, Buckie. Are you hungry? My gosh, this looks so good. Excuse me, sweetie. How's your day? Maisie. Yeah? You wanna talk? Sure. Look... You've had more bad luck in 18 years than anyone should have in a lifetime. Is that supposed to help me sleep tonight? You deserve a break. And you can have that if you can get out of here and leave this all behind you. Leaving doesn't make it go away, Kat. It just means I go away and it all goes with me. My memories go with me. I'll never be able to forget my dad getting hauled off on my birthday, or my mama crawling into the bottle, or my little brother drifting away. Leaving just means I'll... be leaving behind all the other people that have taken care of me all these years. And... I won't be leaving behind any of the bad stuff. I'll just be moving it with me somewhere else. It's not that I'm not ready to go. I can't. My brother needs me. My mom needs me. My dad's about to get out of prison and I'm going to hug him for the first time in ten years. I'll stay if you want me to. In Hoxton. Look, you-- You've always been like the glue that holds us all together. But you don't always have to take care of everybody else. You need to like... go off and start the rest of your life. But I'll stick around till you're ready. That's the craziest thing you've ever said. I need you to go... you know? I need you to be my friend that I can visit on weekends. I need you to be my friend that tells all the hot guys in college about her cute friend at home, okay? So you gotta go. All right. And you can tell them that gotta know me because I'm the luckiest girl in the world... because I live in a safe place with people watching over me and taking care of me... like the Queen of England in Buckingham Palace or that castle. You know... Windsor. Okay. I love you. I love you, too. Hi-de-hi, and howdy doody from your old pal, Uncle Bud. As all farmers say, when there's no rain in the forecast it's going to be another dadgum beautiful day in Hoxton. The high, well, it's going to be in the 90s, a little warm for April. And tonight it'll dip down in the 60s. Now that's all the details you need, really, so let's talk about sports. The Hoxton Warriors split a double header with Maston yesterday. They won the first game and they ran out of gas in the second. And on the national scene, well, trust me, you don't want to hear about anything that happened out in Washington. I could easily have a bad attitude about everything that's happened. What with my dad being in prison and all. But I don't. Because everybody just sort of wrapped their arms around us and took care of us. Me and my little brother Buckie have lived with Kat and her family for ten years. And Harry made me call him Harry from day one. He said he didn't deserve to be called Dad because I already had a dad and I always would. Carolyn, I've always called "other mother". Because my mom sort of... um... Anyway, I'm sorry. I'm going on and on. I just... You know, to be honest, I'm not entirely sure why I was elected class president or why I got to be head cheerleader with Kat, 'cause I'm really not that flexible. Um... But, you know, I guess I get good grades. But I just do that to make my dad proud. It's nothing crazy. I guess they voted for me 'cause I'm sort of an underdog. Maybe I represent what's happening to all the little farmers in this country. Losing our farm the way we did, that shouldn't happen. Not here. Not in the USA. It used to be something like that wasn't allowed. So yeah, I guess I represent the little guys and my friends at Hoxton High wanted everybody to know. Anyway... it means to world to me to be from here. And it means the world to me that they voted me class president. Because being from Hoxton means I got two sets of parents, and a little brother, and Mr. Denton, who's like a granddad to me. And... Itchy, and Lawton... Jesse, Clint, and Kat. That's why I'll always want to live here, why I always will. Any plans for when your daddy gets out. Well, he gets out April 30th. I'm really just hoping everybody will help me give him a big welcome home.

Mom. Good morning. Now you might think it's Saturday morning, but it's not. It's Senior Salute day. Be sure you and your whole family are downtown on Main Street today when the senior class of Hoxton High will be saluted on, yes, a job well done. The parade starts at noon. And if I were you, I'd be there early or you might have to sit in the sun. What? Excuse me. Pardon, excuse me. No, they are not there. The rest of the class is, but they're-- Hello? Hank, did I-- Hank can you hear me? Can you hear me now? Okay, look. There is no sign, not one, of my sweet Kat or Maisie. Or Lawton, or Itchy, or Clint, or Jesse. And we cannot take the class picture without them. And Kat is not answering her phone. Nothing new there. But Maisie is not answering hers either. Now I am a calm and reasonable woman. Are you listening to me, Hank? Calm and reasonable. But at some point, when all sense of order is gone and the rules of law have just flown out the window, it is not unheard of for a person to become just a little agitated. Now my babies are graduating from high school one time. One time, Hank. This is a magical milestone moment for them. Are you listening to me? Three of our banners, three of our banners have been cut down and stolen, Hank. Vandals, vandals, in our town. Roving gangs of vandals are desecrating Senior Salute day. Roving gangs! Now I am not going to lose my self-control. Nor will I insult your intelligence by lining out for you exactly where this is all headed. But you are supposed to keep us safe, Hank. Not allow hordes of devil-worshiping psychopaths to kill us in our beds while we're sleeping, and this is obviously where this is all headed. There is only you between them and us. Thank you. I know you will. I'll see you in church, okay. Paperwork's almost complete. You're looking at about one hour. Thank you. Back then was so different. You wouldn't get on an airplane without a necktie and a suit coat. No shorts, no flip flops, no tank tops... no pajama pants, and no tattoos. Well, bikers had tattoos. I guess bikers always had tattoos. I guess they always will. I don't know why. Anyway, people were better looking then. They were just more polite. You didn't have to lock your doors all time. And if you did lock your doors they figured something was going on back there. You know, a fella could call a girl two, three, four times and never reach her. And when you finally did reach her, she'd already agreed to be some other fella's date to the big party. So... a boy could go from... being in love to being broken-hearted and never even talked to the girl. The good guys were good guys. A lot of cop shows on TV. Westerns were big, too. Movies and TV taught you good lessons. People went to church every Sunday. Nobody had a bolt through the earlobe. Movie stars didn't run round without their underwear on.
