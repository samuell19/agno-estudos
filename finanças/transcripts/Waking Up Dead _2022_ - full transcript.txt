(soft music) (glass shatters) - You gotta get this fuckin' role. You're gonna book this. You're gonna book this one. You're gonna book this one, you're gonna pull yourself out of this fuckin' situation, okay? (Danny exhales) I know this is my last chance. I won't let you down. You gotta let me play, coach. You gotta. (phone buzzing) Fuck! I'm gonna fuck this up! I'm a fuckin' loser! (door closes) - Hey. You remember me? - Yeah. It was that party in the Hills a few months ago, in the hot tub. - I hit you up a few times after. - Been busy. - You got a boyfriend? - Mm-hm. - Do you remember my name? (Danny chuckles) - We were going at in that hot tub all night. I remember you, Ernesto. - It's Anthony. - Open that cash register,now. - I'm from Yemen. I don't understand. -Now! - [Phyllis] They really like you. They'll definitely call you in again, but they're gonna go a little younger. - Younger? I'm 33 and everybody still thinks I'm in my 20's. - [Phyllis] Bitch, you're 35. I gotta take this call, Danny. Bye. (Danny grunting) - Goddammit! He's some trick I fucked years ago, before I even met you. - And he's suddenly hitting you up out of the blue? - Eddy. - Really? - Hey. - You expect me to believe that? - Eddy, I would never do you dirty. (upbeat Spanish music) Hey, come here, come here. - Danny. - You're the best thing that has ever happened to me, all right? - Don't do this to me. - Stop being stupid. - Make me be able to trust you. - You can trust me. I love you. (shower water pattering) (man sighs) - I can get you thrown out for that. - They comp my membership. I'm the reason guys join. (chuckles) - Danny Maldonado. Oh, it's so good to see you again. You know, everyone's still talking about your arc as the necrophiliac rapist in SVU. - Narcoleptic rapist. I loved, loved doing that. It was a great experience. - Oh, well, when was that? - You're doing this shit again? - Two, three years ago. - Five years. - Five, five years. (chuckles) Five. Once I book a good role, I'm gonna turn everything around. No, I promise. Listen, just don't give up on me, baby. Oh, what about the "Green Acres" reboot at Netflix? They castin' Latinos for that? - [Phyllis] They're going with Victor Rasuk. - One other Dominican in Hollywood and he gets all the fuckin' work. - [Phyllis] I have to go, Danny. Gotta take this call. Bye. - Bye. - [Phyllis] All these whiny fucking actors. Like it's my fault they can't get work. I'm just a fucking agent. - Um, Phyllis? You didn't hang up. I can hear you. - [Phyllis] Jesus Christ, Jane. When you hear me say, "I gotta take this call," that means you're supposed to hang up for me. You're the worst fucking assistant ever. - So, so what have you been up to? - You know, keepin' busy. Auditioning. - [Jane] Sorry. - [Phyllis] Fucking useless millennials. You're all a fuckin' pox on the face of this earth. Geez! - [Jane] I said I was sorry, Aunt Phyllis! - Jesus. - [Ilana] Things will pick up. You've been down before and you'll bounce back. Auditions have been so for me too. It's a slow year, it is. Avi and I are having drama again. (phone beeps) - Fuck, I gotta go. It's my sister. - [Ilana] Oh, okay. Love you. - Love you, too, Ilana. - [Sabrina] Danny, you have to fly out here. - It's not a good time. (upbeat Spanish music) - [Sabrina] I'll send you the money. - I got a big gig lined up and I can't. (phone beeps) I gotta take this call Sabrina. It's my agent and it's about the gig. Okay? Bye. - [Woman] I'm in the pink blouse right in front of Trader Joe's. Where are you? - I see you. (upbeat Spanish music) Claire? (record scratches) - [Jane] And Phyllis said to tell you they really liked you. They'll call you in again real soon, but they're going in a different direction. - What the fuck? What the fuck? (Danny grunting) Fuck! Oh, fuck! (Danny breathing heavily) What the fuck am I gonna do? What the fuck am I gonna do? (Danny sobbing) - Excuse me? I love actors and I just wanted to say, I loved you in "Raising Victor Vargas." - That was Victor Rasuk. (Danny sobbing) Oh, god. - Oh. Sorry. (Danny sobbing) - Oh god. - But that was you on "SMILF," right? - That was Miguel Gomez. - Oh, sorry. - Fuck. Fuck! What the fuck am I gonna do? - "Scandal?" - Guillermo fuckin' Diaz, lady! (upbeat music) (soft tinkling) (Danny sighs) - What is up brotha? Long time no see. - Yo, Tony, thank you so much for letting me crash here, man. - Yeah, yeah, no problem. Hey, thanks for taking care of the place while we're on vacay. Nina's sorry she missed you. She already flew out. Is that everything? (Danny scoffs) - These days, yeah. - Okay. - Please, you are talking to someone who spent way too much time in shelters as a kid. Yo, this place is fire, son. Come on. - Yeah, well, with Nina being a designer, she's classed me up a bit. (Tony laughs) We're still settling in, but as soon as we get back from vacation, she wants to get started on the nursery. - Come on. Nah. - Dude, where have you been? I text blasted, emailed. I'm gonna be a dad. - Yo, aye, I'm so, so sorry, man. I've been busy with like so much shit lately wrapped up. This is great news, man. - Thank you, thank you. - Wow, look at you. Can't believe that you're gonna be a dad. Wife- - Right? - Kid, this fuckin' house. - Geez. Dude, we were ballers back in those bartending days. (Danny laughs) - Yeah. (phone buzzing) Oh. Oh, it's my sister. It can wait. - Yeah, come on. Let me give you a tour. - Please. Wow. - Hey, listen. We didn't get a chance to talk about you and Eddy. - Nah, it was time to move on. You know, I'm actually more worried about him. He took it pretty hard. - Two years, right? - Two years, three months, one week. Yeah, something like that. - So you gonna be okay by yourself? - Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. I'm gonna, like, use this time to decompress. You know, read. (birds chirping) Definitely step back from the industry. You know, meditate. - Uh huh. (birds chirping) - Definitely doing all those things. - Okay. (phone pinging) (birds chirping) (upbeat music) (Danny sighs) - Fuck. (upbeat music) Fuck. (Danny sighs) (phone buzzing) - Hello? - [Woman] Hi, I'm looking for Danny Maldonado. - Speaking. - Hi Danny, this is Kate from Consolidated Credit. Just wondering- (Danny sighs) - Aw, sh... Shit. Shit. Fuck. Shit. (Danny sighs) Fuck! What the? Fuck! (phone pinging) (upbeat music) (birds chirping) (phone buzzing) Don't even offer to pay for the flight. I can't pay you back what I owe you as it is. - I don't care about the money. It's really bad now. This is it. You need to be here. - You act like I owe this woman something. - It's not for her. (car door closes) - I gotta go. I got a rehearsal. - Danny? (upbeat music) - Check it out. I'm thinkin' of doin' a one man show and I'm gonna call it, "No, I Will Not Send You An Uber: Stories of Trickin' Up In LA." - Oh my God. It's so good. You must. (laughs) - Right? It's gonna be good. Things are just really slow right now. Like everything is trans. - Honestly, Danny, maybe you should just cut it off. Like imagine life without your big dick. - Ugh. I'd read more, I guess. - Good. - And I'd finally binge those last two seasons of "Scandal." - It'd be like a whole new life for you. That's all I'm sayin'. Consider it. (record scratches) - When did you see him? - Avi and I ran into him at the ArcLight for like a second. I shouldn't have said anything. - Was he with a guy? - He was with a friend. - A guy? - A friend that is a male, a male that is a friend. - Did Eddy ask about me? - Not really. Well he asked how you were doing and I said that you were kind of having a tough time right now. Well, and then he said that you spent your entire life being selfish and self absorbed and that this is your karma. (Danny scoffs) I'm sorry. (Danny sighs) (Danny scoffs) - Oh my God... (birds chirping) We're broken up for two months and he's already running around getting new dick. Like who does that? - You know what your problem is? You think you have the right to get away with shit. You think you're owed. (Danny scoffs) - My mother was a drug addict. If it wasn't for my sister, I probably wouldn't even be alive. And you're telling me I'm entitled? (Danny scoffs) Why are all my friends beating up on me today? - Only when we stop playing victim can we finally move forward. - Whatever the fuck that means, - You know what that means. - Raven, I appreciate you coming by today, but I do not need your life coaching shit right now. - Excuse me? I have 33,832 followers on Instagram and I'm this close to signing a major ebook deal. - Wait, really? - [Raven] Mm-hm. - Dead ass? - Dead ass. Positive manifestation geared to single women on the dating scene. - [Danny] Nice. - It's called "Send Me No Ubers: A Memoir of Learning to Love Yourself." (Danny mumbling) - Oh, Jesus. - What? That's a fucking great title, you Philistine. (birds chirping) (microwave whirring) - [Woman] Hi Danny, this is Kate from Consolidated Credit. Just wondering if you're ready to make a payment on- - [Man] Hey bro, it's Antonio. I know you're going through a lot, but I need to talk to you. It's about Mikey. (microwave beeping) - Yo, come on. I've been with Sprint for like 10 years. You guys can't gimme one more payment extension? Come on, just one more. I really don't wanna have to take my business somewhere else. Hey Jane, how are you? Listen, I'm gonna leave Sprint and I haven't selected a new carrier yet, so just giving everybody my friend's home phone number for now. It's even got like this whole answering machine and shit. - [Jane] Why don't you just get a new carrier? - Okay, 323... 461... (shower water pattering) (upbeat music) - Where's the fuckin' soap? (Danny scoffs) Fuck! (Danny sighs) (Danny sighs) (birds chirping) (Antonio sniffling) - Listen to me. I know cheaters. Mikey's not one. He's not playing you. He's a great guy. He loves you. - Things haven't been the same for like a couple of months now. I feel like something is up. You think I'm being paranoid? - You know, I always envied you and Mikey. You're like a happy family. - We are. I love that boy. We're so happy, it's fucking corny. - Yeah, you guys are fuckin' corny. (both laughing) Yeah. (Antonio sighs) I wish Eddy and I had what you two have, you know? Hey, stay calm. This will pass. It's nothin'. Don't you worry about it. - You're a good friend, man. Thank you for being here for me. And I'm sorry for what you're going through. (Antonio sniffs) Why do smell like Cascade? - Mira, it's Dawn. Not fuckin' Cascade. (phone ringing) (answering machine beeps) - [Sabrina] Thank you for the number. It's not too late. You could still make it in time. Don't run away, Danny. (Danny sighs) (kiss smacks) (Danny grunting) - Fuck! (Danny breathing heavily) (Danny choking) (Danny grunting) (phone ringing) (Danny grunting) (answering machine beeps) - [Jane] Hey Danny, this is Jane from Aunt Phyllis's from the Phyllis Osgard Talent Agency and I have great news. (Danny choking) You got called in for the new Shonda Rhimes Netflix pilot. And she called you in especially. She remembered you from CSI. - SVU! - [Jane] So give us a call back. It's time sensitive. (Danny choking) (upbeat music) (fabric rips) (Danny screams) - [Phyllis] You're a pre-op transgender surgeon who just got out of the OR. - So I'm transgender, male to female? - [Phyllis] No, you're pre-op. You've not had the surgery. You're still male. - You said I just got out of surgery. - [Phyllis] Listen to me. You're a pre-op transgender individual, still male, but you're also a hot shot surgeon riddled with demons and you just got outta surgery- - My surgery. I'm operating on myself? - [Phyllis] Whoever heard of such a thing? No, you were operating on your mother who revealed to you as you were wheeling her into the OR that she's a lesbian with a crystal meth problem. Plus she's in possession of top secret information that could bring down the entire government of Singapore in one fell swoop. They've got Rosie Perez pinned for that. Also you have two lovers. One is played by Peter Dinklage and he has Lou Gehrig's. I'm emailing you the sides now, Danny. Get me that tape by five. - I'll print it out. Oh my god. (Danny exhales) 5:00 PM. 5:00 PM. (upbeat music) (phone pinging) (Danny exhales) - I am so grateful as I book this pilot. - One more time. Smile. - I am so grateful as I book this pilot. - That's right. You're a grateful bitch. - I'm a grateful bitch. - You're a grateful bitch. - I'm a grateful bitch. - You're a grateful bitch. - I'm a grateful bitch. - Repeat your gratitude affirmation constantly. - I'm so grateful as I book this book pilot. I am so grateful as I book this pilot. - Next. You want it? Commit. - Okay. - So clean up your act. - Okay. - Get yourself in a good, clean head space. Drug free. - Mm-hm. Mm-hm. - No drugs. - Mm-hm. - You can do this. - I can do this. - You can do this. - I can do this. - You can do this. - I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna book this pilot and then I'm gonna get Eddy back. Raven, thank you. Watch me turn shit around. - Thank you. - Why does you cologne smell like Palmolive? - It's Dawn. Why does everybody keep saying that? Clearly Dawn. I am so grateful as I book this pilot. I am so grateful as I book this pilot. I am so grateful as I book this pilot. (Danny exhales) 5:00 PM. Six hours. I got this. (soft tinkling) Cleaning up my act and I'm so grateful as I book this pilot. Cleaning up my act and I'm so grateful as I book this pilot. Cleaning up my act and I'm so grateful as I book this pilot. Cleaning up my act and I'm so grateful as I book this pilot. Cleaning up my act and I'm so grateful as I book this pilot. I'm cleaning up my act and I'm so grateful as I book this pilot. I'm cleaning up my act and I'm so grateful as I book this pilot. I'm cleaning up my act and I am so grateful as I book this pilot. I'm cleaning up my act and I am so grateful as I book this pilot. Cleaning up my act and I'm so grateful as I book this pilot. I am cleaning up my act and I'm so grateful as I book this pilot. I'm cleaning up my act and I am so grateful as I book this pilot. I'm cleaning up my act and I am so grateful as I book this pilot. I'm booking this pilot and I'm cleaning up my act and I am so grateful. I'm cleaning up my act and I'm gonna book this pilot. I'm cleaning up my act, I'm gonna book this pilot. I asked for 20 CCS of a pina... Epinephrine and some snot nosed RN hands me after atra-atro... Tropine, and I'm supposed to calm down? If I can't save my own mother, what kind of doctor am I? If I can't save my own mother, what kind of doctor am I? Get me the ambassador to Singapore, stat. I asked for 20 CCS of apprenaphrene and some snot nosed RN hands me atropine... Atro... - [Computer] Endotracheal. - Endo... - [Computer] Endotracheal. - Trach... En... If I can't even say my own mother, what kind of doctor am I? - Ep, epiniphrene? Stat! - [Computer] Endotracheal. Endotracheal. - Endotrach... En... (record scratches) Fuck. (Danny sucks teeth) Would it kill you to put some fuckin' clothes on, man? (Danny breathing heavily) Fuck. Fuck me, man. Fuck my life, man. - [Lila] Tony. Oh, I'm so sorry. The door was ajar. I texted Tony to say I would be dropping by with some paperwork for the house. I'm the realtor. I'm Lila. - You are so beautiful. (Lila chuckles) - Well, hello. - You're an actress? - Yes. (laughs) I started very young, modeling for department stores and such. - In London? - Yes, yes. London, swinging London. (chuckles) And then that led to commercials and small parts in films and I was a single mother, so I took whatever came my way. And then an American agent signed me, and so I packed up my boy and off we went to Hollywood. The year was 1971. - Wow. Hm? - No, thank you. I don't partake. - What was Hollywood like then? - Oh. It was fabulous. (both laughing) The first party I attended when I got here was at Natalie Wood's house. Everyone was there. - No. - Yeah. Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Robert Wagner, although he and Natalie hadn't remarried at that point. Mia Farrow, Warren Beatty. And everyone was so glamorous. And in the middle of the party, in walked this delicate creature in the most divine dress with her hair in rollers, covered in a handkerchief. It was Joan Collins. - Oh really? From "Dynasty?" - Yes, but that was years away. - Did you work a lot? - Quite a bit, yeah. I made two films with Frank Sinatra and I worked with Ryan O'Neal and Donald Sutherland, all the biggest stars of the day. (chuckles) I was going to be the next Julie Christie. That's what everyone said. Julie Christie. Oh. Oh, she was divine then and now. She was nominated for an Academy Award a few years back. - Oh, right, right, right. She played a woman with AIDs. - Alzheimer's. - Alzheimer's. Why'd you stop? Acting? - My son, Donnell. He got into some trouble when he was a teenager. (Danny inhales) Do you do that a lot? - The vape? Weed? - Mm. - I guess, I don't know. It's legal now, right? (both chuckling) I don't know anything about being a surgeon. I barely got through high school. - You don't need a university degree to play a surgeon. (Danny sighs) - Things were going so well in my career for a couple of years. I was working a lot. Everybody was saying I was gonna blow up. And then I just, I started to choke. I would get these, I would get these panic attacks before auditions. I don't even know why. I felt like I was so close, like I was gonna make it and then it all just fell apart. It's like the universe was saying, that's it, that's all you get, now go back to groveling and struggling. It's all I ever knew, anyway. Some days I just wanna wake up dead. That's what my mom used to say. - And where is she? Your mother. - She passed. - Okay. On your feet. Come on. Stand up straight. You know what you are? You're a surgeon and you're a damn good one. Words are irrelevant. This is what matters, Danny. Tap into your pain. That's your truth. - I asked for 20 CCS of epinephrine and some snot nosed RN hands me atropine and... Ah, I fucked up the line! - It doesn't matter. Keep going. - I ask for 20 CCS of epinephrine and some snot nosed RN hands me atropine and I'm supposed to stay calm? - Danny, why are you so angry? - Because some RN almost just killed my mother. - Don't. Don't play anger. Anger's banal. What's behind the anger? What's fueling it? Guilt? Self-loathing? - Okay. For years I was the hot shot, the one that was going places. I was the guy everyone wanted to be. Everyone... But me. Now I'm finally figuring out who I am and she reappears outta nowhere, just to hold me back, like she always did. - What if it's funny? That last line. - Like she always did? Well, his mother reappeared out of the blue with all her drama so all the pain she caused him is like flooding back. He's crashing and burning. - What if he's not crashing and burning? What if he's finding himself? - Huh... Let me look at the dialogue. (phone ringing) (answering machines beeps) - [Sabrina] My brother. This is it. She's not coming back. She probably won't make it through the night. - Sabrina, it's not a good time. Can I give you a ring back in a bit? No, I'm rehearsing right now. I gotta go. I gotta, we'll talk about it later, all right? Bye. - Who's dying, Danny? Is it your mother? - I haven't seen or spoken to her in 20 years. She's a drug addict. Can we go back to rehearsal now? - She's your mother. - I don't have a mother. My sister raised me. You don't know what it's like dealing with a selfish, angry fucked up addict, Lila. That's that's not your world. - My son, Donnell. I lost him to drugs. Heroin. He was only 19. It's not their fault. - Yes. Yes it is, actually. - No, it's not. It's in their genes. In their DNA. We didn't know that then. Oh, I was so angry with him. Why wasn't he trying to get better? Why was he doing this to me? Why wouldn't he just stop up? I didn't know what he was up against. Where is she? Your mother? - Doesn't matter. New York. - You must go to her. (Danny scoffs) - No. - Oh, if it's the money, if it's the money, I can help- - No, stop it, I'm not taking money from you. - We can use my air miles and- - Air miles. - And it won't cost anything. - Lila. - Danny, I'm a mother. Please let me help you. - She would disappear on us to hook up with guys or go looking for drugs. It didn't matter how young we were. We would wake up and she'd just be gone. One time, I must have been like nine years old, and she was gone for days. So Sabrina and I went looking. I knew this guy she hooked up with a lot. I knew where he lived, so I went to his house. My mother answered the door. She started screaming at me. Why was I always causing trouble? Why couldn't I just leave her the fuck alone? It was winter, it was freezing out. But I stood outside and I waited for her. People would walk by, ask me if I was okay. "No I'm all right. My mom's just inside. She's visiting friend. She'll be out in a minute." I was just happy to find her alive, to be honest with you. You may be a mother, Lila, but there's no mother in this story. There's no role for you to play. I'm homeless, all right? I have no money, I'm a failure. This, this is all I have, okay? I don't nail this, put a bullet in me. I'm done. I don't need this, all right? I can take it from here. Thank you for your help. Please. - I understand. Good luck, Danny. - I gotta do this. (timer ticking) (skillet thuds) (Danny grunts) (Danny grunting) (Ilana gasps) - Oh God, Danny. What... Somebody's boyfriend kicked your ass? Jesus, what- - Shh, shh. I'm in pain, it's perfect. You remember to bring the makeup? - Yeah. - Okay, good. - I got it. - Let's do this. - Such an idiot. Oof. (Danny wincing) - Oh. - Sorry. Oh, this is covering up nicely. - Three years I was the hot shot. I'm gonna be honest with you and I'm gonna tell you the truth. I've been selfish and self-absorbed. - [Ilana] No. - Because of everything that I've been through, I guess, like, I felt like it gave me license to always put me first, only care about the next fuck. - [Ilana] That's not true. - It is. For years, I was the hot shot. The guy that was going places, the one everyone wanted to be. Everyone... But me. Now I finally know who I am, you know? And she reappears outta nowhere just to hold me back. (Danny chuckles) Like she always did it. - What are you gonna do now, Dr. Rodriguez? - I'm gonna go back in there and I'm gonna stay until she wakes and I'm gonna make things right. - Nailed it. (Danny chuckles) - Feels good. - Oh. I'm proud of you, Danny. - Thank you. - Seriously, that was so terrific. - Oh, come on. - Why do you smell like Ajax? - It's Dawn. - [Phyllis] I've got a good feeling about this one, pal. Sending it to them right now. - Thank you, Phyllis. Thank you for everything. - [Phyllis] Talk soon, Danny. - Bye. (Ilana chuckles) Oh my God. Ugh. (Ilana sighs) (Danny sighs) I just wanna, I wanna book this and I wanna call Eddy and tell him that I turned everything around. I want him to believe in me again. - Totally. - Hm. How are you? How are things with Avi? - Things are great. (Ilana gasps) I actually have some exciting career news of my own. - Go on. - I booked a callback for the Brady Bunch revival on Hulu. - Oh my God. - It's just like the original series except Alice is undocumented and Bobby has gender identity issues. - That is so great. Who are you reading for? - Carol's ex-wife. Ah! (Ilana chuckles) (timer ringing) - I am so grateful as I book this pilot. I am so grateful as I book this pilot. (toilet flushes) (Danny sighs) So grateful as I book this pilot. I'm so grateful- - What? - As I book this pilot. I'm so grateful as I book this pilot. I'm so... (phone ringing) Hello? - [Phyllis] I have one question for you, buddy. What is the almost cast, soon to be star of the hot, new Shonda Rhimes Netflix series want for dinner? Because I'm taking you out. - Oh my God, I'm pinned? - [Phyllis] You're pinned, boo. - Well when will we know for sure? - [Phyllis] Soon, maybe even by the time I see you tonight. I'm gonna take you to some place real expensive looking. Picking you up at six. Give Jane your address and make her repeat it back to you. She's a fuckin' moron. - Okay. (line drops) (Danny sighs) (Danny laughs) - So I had a really great time, papi. - Yeah. - And you know, I could tell you did, too, so you know, when are we gonna hang again? You know, 'cause your cock is incredible. - Thanks. Five stars on Yelp. Don't forget. Dale. (phone line trilling) Please don't hang up. I got great news. (Eddy scoffs) - [Eddy] What is it? - I'm pinned for the new Shonda Rhimes pilot. It's a series regular. It's the lead. I finally got my shit together. - [Eddy] I'm so happy for you. - Eddy, I'm so sorry for everything that I put you through, but I wanna celebrate with you. Will you come to me, baby, please? I am so grateful as I book this pilot. So grateful as I book this pilot. I'm so- (phone buzzing) So there's liquor and mixers if you wanna drink. Tony left the place pretty empty, but the bar is stocked. - I'm good. - There's no real food. There's some leftover Chinese that Raven brought over the other night. I can microwave it for us. - I can't hang for long. - You got plans? - Mm-hm. - Work, you gotta teach a yoga class? - Mm-mm. - What, you got somewhere to be? - Mm-hm. - With the guy that Ilana and Avi saw you with? - This place is beautiful, man. - With the guy that Ilana and Avi caught you with, right? That guy? - Tell me about the series. - Okay. So I play a surgeon whose mother is a drug addict and a lesbian and she gets brought into the ER with an overdose, so I gotta try to save her life. - Wow. Wow, okay. - Get this, get this. I'm transgender. About to have the surgery, male to female. - That's ironic. - What? - That you're playing a transgender individual. You were always pretty transphobic, dude. (Danny scoffs) - Me? No way. What? No. - Yes way, actually. - Uh, not at all. I think they are so brave, plus they're so in right now, so it's got like awards potential for me and shit. - You won't be winning on any awards for self-awareness, that's for fucking sure. - Eddy. What'd I do? (Danny sobbing) Please don't leave me. Don't go. I don't know what to do. I love you. (Danny sobbing) I'm sorry. (Danny sobbing) (kisses smacking) (Danny sobbing) (heavy breathing) (kisses smacking) - Danny? - Yeah, baby? - You're not hard. - This has never happened to me before. And things were finally starting to go well again. - It doesn't matter. - I'm a top. It matters. Wait, you mean that the important thing is that you're here with me? That's what matters? - I mean, I don't really care that you can't fuck me right now. You're not that good in bed. (Danny scoffs) I've had better sex. - We had sex all the time. I fucked you constantly. You love my dick. - I liked having sex with you because I loved you. But you're lazy in bed. You coast off your dick. (Danny scoffs) You're a good kisser, I like the way you hold me. You know, you have a great body- - Hey, okay, every guy I've ever fucked has hit me up and begged me to come back. All right, you wanna see my phone? You wanna see how many guys are hittin' me up 24/7? - I've seen. - That's not what I... Eddy. Where are you going? - To get some dick. (Danny sighs) - Fuck! (door slams) (birds chirping) (doorbell chimes) - Swanky, swanky. I see somebody saved their residuals from their big stint on SVU. (Danny laughs) - I wish I had. I spent all that money on blow and tricking up in Miami for the summer. - At least you didn't waste it. - Hey, I know you're driving, but you want a drink? - Oh, no. God forbid the po-po pulled me over and hit me up with a breathalyzer again, spread eagle in a cheap car. Let's stick with this. - I'm in. (Danny chuckles) Let's do it. Let's do it. (Danny and Phyllis laugh) (Phyllis snorts) (Phyllis sighs) This is great shit. - My guy Jacob's the best. Here's his card. - Oh. You know, Phyllis, after I book this series, I wanna make some changes in my life. - Just don't go into recovery. It makes people boring. - Well, I wanna start to give back, you know? I wanna do stuff for the trans community, the environment. - Can I just say something? And it's not like I'm a Trump supporter or anything. Well, what's so bad about global warming? I mean, who the fuck doesn't like warm weather? Have you ever been to Palm Springs? Everybody's happy. Those queens, they're just grinnin' from ear to ear. I mean they're old, but they're happy. I mean, think about it. Have you ever met anybody in your life that woke up and said, "Geez, I wish it was fuckin' freezing balls out today," because I haven't, and I know everybody that's worth knowing, believe me. (Phyllis snorts) - I want this series to start a new chapter for me. I gotta grow up, Phyllis. - Danny, you didn't get the pilot. I got the call on my way over here. They just decided it was more appropriate to go with an actual trans performer. Look, it's nothing personal. It's just everything about you is wrong. - Okay, um... Well the good thing is I'm starting to get my heat back, right? So I'm feeling momentum again. Maybe at dinner tonight, we can strategize about how to build on this, right? It was, I mean I was pinned, so it was close. Phyllis? - Danny, we're dropping you as a client. You're just not booking. Look, it's not me. I love you. It's those assholes down at the agency. They just don't see what I see. What can I do? - But it's your agency. You own it. - You ever wonder why there's so many assholes on the face of this earth? Because there are assholes everywhere. Like today I was driving down Laurel Canyon on my way to see you and I got stuck at a light behind one of those transport vans for disabled people. You know what I'm talking about? And let me tell you, these disabled people, they took their sweet fuckin' time gettin' on that van. I mean, you would've thought that the whole world revolved around them. They could give a shit about anybody else. What a bunch of assholes. So there I am, stuck behind that fucking van, unable to get past, but that's when I got the call that you didn't get the pilot. And I was like, wow. Well now I have time to cancel my dinner reservations and make plans with one of my working clients. So you see, Danny, those disabled people, they were fuckin' assholes, but they served a purpose. And it's the same thing down at my agency. Each and every person that works for me is an asshole. You've been down at the agency. Haven't you ever been in that office and thought, wow, these people are really assholes. But here's the thing, that's why I hired them. Because now I can sit here with you, my very dear and good friend, and I can say, Danny, I'm sorry. The assholes down at the agency are insisting that I let you go. What can I do? They're assholes. But without them there to hide behind, I'd be the one dropping you. I'd be the asshole. And I'm not an asshole, Danny. I'm your friend. You're gonna turn this around. You will. You've got that star quality. (Danny scoffs) And when things swing back your way and you land that perfect role and you step up to that podium to collect your Golden Globe or SAG Award or Oscar, I want you to know that when you turn around, there I'll be, right beside you, acting like I was there the whole time. In this town, Danny, that's the closest thing to true friendship as you can get. So you hang in there, sunshine. (Danny sobbing) (phone ringing) (answering machines beeps) - Danny, she's dead. Why did you make me go through this alone? (Sabrina sobbing) (Danny sobbing) (knocking on door) - Oh. Hello, Danny. How are you? - I never wanted to succeed for me. It was always for her. - Your mom? - No, my sister. I don't think I ever made anyone happy. Not her, not Eddy. No one. - I had to put him in a rehab facility. It was the third try, but he ran away with his girlfriend and they ended up in some seedy hotel outside Los Angeles. And of course the first thing they did was score some heroin. She shot him up. He was only 19, but he was already so sick and his body couldn't handle it. He began to choke on his own vomit and then he began to have convulsions. And she panicked, then she fled. You know, sometimes I struggle to recall the sound of his voice. So many years have passed. (Lila sighs) Some days, I think I've forgotten it for good and I panic. And then suddenly I can hear it in the distance and it brings me such relief. But I know the day will come when I will have forgotten it for good and then all I will have left is the guilt. My son died choking on his own vomit on a motel room floor. No one was there to hold him. He left this world alone. "The moment we ceased to hold each other, the sea engulfs us and the light goes out." James Baldwin. Donnell's favorite American writer. Go to her funeral, Danny. Don't let her leave this world alone. You've hit bottom and that's a terrible thing, but it's also a good thing. Things can only get better from here. - No. It can get worse, I've learned. (Lila sighs) - I have to show a house in the Palisades. Can I come back later and take you out to dinner and we can talk? (Lila shouts) - Give up on me, lady. - You're right. You haven't hit bottom. You're still a self-absorbed shit! - You couldn't even save your own son, Lila. And you can't save me. (Lila sobbing) (door closes) (phone ringing) (answering machine beeps) - [Jane] Hello, Danny. This is Jane from the Phyllis Osgard Talent Agency. I have great news. Shonda Rhimes wants you after all. The actor they offered the role to dropped out. - Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. - [Jane] Hey Danny. The actor they offered the role to dropped out. She booked the second lead in the new "Howard the Duck" reboot at Sony. - Great. - [Jane] So you're in? You need to meet Shonda ASAP. How soon can you get to the Shondaland offices? - Um, gimme like 45 minutes. - Great. I'll email you the drive on. - I'm so happy. I love you, Jane. - [Jane] We love you too, Danny. And Phyllis wanted to let you know, we take the commission on this, having dropped you not withstanding. - Sure thing. - [Jane] Bye Danny. - Bye. (shower water pattering) (Danny humming) - I'm a horrible person. (punch thuds) (Danny grunts) (phone ringing) (punch thuds) (answering machine beeps) - [Phyllis] Hey superstar. So fucking proud of you. Now you can show these asshole down at the agency what you're capable of. (punch thuds) (Danny grunts) (shrill ringing) (soft tinkling) (phone ringing) (Danny coughing) (answering machine beeps) - [Jane] Hello, Danny, it's Jane. Aunt Phyllis can't believe you bailed on Shonda Rhimes. You blew this, Danny. She said to tell you we're dropping you again and you should no longer consider her your friend.

(insects buzzing) - You Danny? (Danny chuckles) - One and only. (Danny coughs) - What happened to your face? - Had a bad breakup. With life. (Danny coughs) - That supposed to be funny? - I keep trying to move forward. You know, taking steps, living the dream. - [Jacob] I hear you, man. - Just trying to get to where I want to be. You know, so many times I thought this is it. I'm gonna call my sister and I'm gonna say, "I finally made it. I've arrived. I'm in Hollywood." (Danny sucks teeth) This is just too tough for me. - [Jane] Well... Life is tough. - Yeah. Yeah it is. (soft music) - [Jacob] Let me see your vein. There you go. Pump your fist. Come on. Okay. That's good. All right? - Ow. Ow. - [Jacob] Nice. - More. Oh. Oh, fuck. (Danny breathing heavily) - [Jacob] Can you let go? - Wow, that's... That's... Yeah. Yeah. Wow. - [Jacob] There you go. - Hey, Jacob. Thank you. Really. - You want me to lock the door behind me? Danny? Hey. (snaps fingers) Over here, over here. (snapping fingers) (Jacob whistles) Do you want me to lock the door behind me? All right. - Oh that's... That's nice. Oh that's nice. I just wanna go to sleep. Eddy. You got my message? I'm so glad you're here. (water running) (Danny puking) I'm so sorry for how I treated you. I know I need your forgiveness. We just got to the east coast to see my sister and I can't. - [Phyllis] But you can record yourself on your iPhone. It's so easy. - Nah, I think I'm gonna skip this one. - [Phyllis] All right. I'll let 'em know. - [Danny] Hey, we'll get 'em next time. - [Phyllis] Bye Danny. - Bye Phyllis. - Bye Eddy. No, Jane. You cannot take a lunch. You're a fucking intern. Good God, you're a waste of millennial space. (Danny laughs) - Bad day at the office for Jane. - [Eddy] Apparently. - Poor thing. - Oh my God. I'll be back in a minute. You want anything? - No, thanks. I'm fine. (Danny clears throat) (gentle music) These guys... - [Woman] What the fuck is wrong with you, man? You stupid? Fuck, man. What are you, stupid? I gotta tie your fuckin' shoelaces? Really? You know what? I can't do this shit, man. I gotta pee. (melancholy music) - What's up, little man? Hey, you want me to show you how to tie your laces? Yeah? All right. So check this out. So first make bunny ears like that. See that? - [Boy] Uh huh. - All right and then you cross 'em over and you make an X like that. And then you pull the bunny ears out. Go ahead. Easy, right? (Danny chuckles) - [Woman] Rico! I'm sorry, love. (doorbell chimes) - [Lila] Danny? - [Woman] Mama gets a little crazy sometimes, but mama loves you. Look, I got you a treat. - Hey. - [Lila] Danny? - You're loved, remember that, okay? And don't lose your way. Now go to her. (Sabrina laughing) - [Sabrina] Hi, come. Give me a hug. (all laughing) - I'm such an adult now. I don't even know who I am anymore. Tell her. - He's making great strides into near adulthood. (all laughing) (banging on door) (melancholy music) - Danny? (Danny choking) Don't panic. It's all right, Danny. I'm here. Don't panic. Don't panic. Now, come on. That's it. That's it, giving it up. That's it. That's it. (Danny cough) Good boy. That's it. Get rid of it. That's it, get rid of it. (Danny coughing) That's it. Good boy. Oh, you're doing it. (Danny gasping) Here we go. Here we go. Good boy. Good boy. (Danny sobbing) Oh, good boy. Can you feel me? - [Danny] I can feel you, Lila. I can feel your warmth. - [Lila] Good. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. There you go. You're okay now. You're okay. - Come here. You're doing great. (Sabrina chuckles) (water running) (door creaks) - Hello. (soft music) - There's so much I wanted to say to you, so on the plane, I wrote it all down. (soft acoustic music) Sis... (soft acoustic music) (soft acoustic music)
