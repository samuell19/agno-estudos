- [Woman] John, come on. Let's go, we've seen enough. (John laughs) - You said you weren't gonna be scared. - I lied a little. I was wrong, I admit it. Come on, I've lost my interest in old buildings, let's go. - No, not yet. - Look, I admit it, I'm scared, what do I have to say? Why don't we go? - Well, because I think you're going to be perfect. - No, don't do that, come on, please! Okay, come on out. Please don't scare me. Where are you? Look, I know you're gonna jump out. It won't be a surprise, it won't scare me. (steel dings) Come on out, please don't hide. (suspenseful music) (man grunts) (screams) (ominous music) - Unfortunately, when we talk about deviancy in society, we face the problem of determining what is in fact normal. Of all the deviant behavior patterns we find in society, perhaps the most common is incest, followed closely by homosexuality. Both of these are culturally-defined patterns and societal attitudes towards them vary from one society to another. In fact, generally we classify them as relative deviant patterns. Does anybody have the time? - Five after 12. - Okay, that's enough for today. On Monday we'll talk about another pattern that might be of interest to all of you, cannibalism. Have a good weekend. (smooth jazz music) - Please, madam, keep walking. Act as if nothing is happening. If you value my life, please madam, make pretend as though we are together. Do not look behind you, whatever you do. Don't look behind, please! Please do not look behind you. (woman laughs) Well, now as you have looked behind you, let me ask you a few questions? - No. - Did you possibly see two men in dark suits getting out of a Citreon with a French poodle? - No. - No. Okay then, how about two men in dark suits getting out of a Volkswagen with a German Shepherd, you saw that, no, huh? - No, I'm sorry. - No, alright. Did you possibly see two gentlemen in dark suits getting out of a Rolls Royce with a bulldog? - No, I'm sorry, I can't help. - Are you absolutely certain? - I'm absolutely certain. - Good, then we are safe. (woman laughs) Will you go on a picnic with me? - Oh, you're too much. - Please? - No, I really can't. - Please, look, I've got a jug of wine. I got a jug of wine and I got a loaf of bananas, and I got a piece of bread and I need a doll and you're a doll. - (laughs) Oh, thank you very much but I really can't. I just can't, I have too much to do this afternoon. - What could you possibly have to do that's more important than going on a picnic? - I have a lot of homework and I have to finish a painting and it's almost the end of semester. - Are you a painter? - Yeah, a little, you know. - Do you know a painting called (speaks French)? (woman sighs and speaks French) (speaks French) - (laughs) Yeah, I know it. - And who painted that painting? - Manet. - Manet. And was Manet a great painter? - Yeah, he was a great painter. - He was a great painter, and what is that painting of? - Could it be of a picnic? - A picnic! And what experience gave Manet the great power to portray it on canvas? - Well, I would say it's because he suffered and because, because he worked on his paintings hard-- - And? And, and, and? And he went on a picnic. - You're right, he went on a picnic, but there were two men on that picnic, and there was a nude woman, and we just don't have the requirements. - Oh, wait, that's okay, I'll be nude! Hey, wait! (smooth jazz music) - [Woman] Why do these things always happen to me? - [John] Well, look, Jenny. You have to admit that picnic was a gourmet's delight. - [Jenny] Yeah, I'll have to admit. Bananas and bread is pretty exotic. Hey, I have a question, how did you know my name? - Psychic. - (laughs) No way. - Good guess. (Jenny chuckles) Well, actually, I asked your professor. - [Jenny] Are you in my class? - [John] No, I don't go to school, I work in the newspaper. - [Jenny] Ace reporter, huh? - [John] Well, (chuckles) actually, for the time being, I run errands, but I'm supposed to start writing in the features section soon. - [Jenny] What will you write about, travel? You don't even know the way back. (laughs) - [John] Wait, you'll see. We should've turned left back there. - [Jenny] No, I'm absolutely positive it was right. We're goin' the right way, believe me! (chuckles) - Absolutely positive it was right, huh? - Well, it does look at this point like I made a slight error. - Oh, no. - What do you suppose that's for? (dark tones) - [John] Who knows? - Oh, no, wait, John, let's see where it goes! - [John] Oh, come on, let's go. - Where's your spirit of adventure? - I lost it in the Greyhound bus depot. - Typical. (chuckles) Aren't you curious? - You really wanna? - Yeah. (John chuckles) - Okay. - Let's walk. - [John] Let's drive. (smooth jazz music) (ominous tones) - Wow! This is incredible. What do you think it was? - I don't know, probably an old resort. There used to be a lot of them in this valley in the 1890s. - Yeah? - [John] Hey, Jenny! Look, I was right! Soda Spring Spa. - Hey, you're not so dumb after all. (ominous tones) (ominous tones) - [John] Jenny, where are you goin'? - I'm going up here to see what's there, come on! (suspenseful music) (door creaks) (door creaks) - Who are you? What are you doing here? You startled me! - Oh! I startled you? God, I thought I was having a heart attack! - Well, it's your own fault. You know that trespassing is illegal, child? It serves you right! - What's the matter? Are you okay? - Yeah. - Who are you? - Who, me? I live here! The question is, who are you? - Well, we saw the buildings and we were curious. - Oh. Curiosity killed the cat. - We meant no harm. - We were just coming back from a picnic and we got kind of lost. - Well, I guess there's no harm done. Here, let's go out in the sunshine. I just worry about young hooligans and vandals breaking all my windows. - Do you really live here? - Yes, I do, child. Would you like to see my rose? I'm just about to make some tea, would you like some? - Oh, if it's no trouble. - No, no! I was just about to put it on, come along! - What kind of spa was this? - Oh, this spa was famous for its mineral waters. And its hot spring baths. Of course, the weather was perfect, too. This is one of the cottages used by guests who stayed for a longer time. You're going to have to excuse the mess in here. I'm not used to having visitors. (laughs) Oh, good heavens. I've completely forgotten my manners. My name is Abercrombi, Agnes Abercrombi. - I'm Jenny Macallister. And this is John-- - Devers. - Well, I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. Make yourselves at home, and I'll go see if the tea kettle is hot. - Oh, look, John. - There we go! - Oh, thank you. Do you live here by yourself? - Yes, I do, child. Actually, it's very comfortable here. - These rooms look very comfortable. Do you use the rest of the house? - Oh, no, I boarded most of them up. They're all fallin' down inside. - How many other buildings are there? - Oh, there are 13 and a half. - (chuckles) And a half? (Agnes laughs) - You young people probably think we're silly, but, we think 13's an unlucky number. And when the architects planned to call for 13 buildings, they made him add an extra one. - [John] What do the insides look like? - Oh, they're pretty, pretty messy now. They're all fallin' down. - [John] Do you mind if we look around? - [Agnes] Oh, no! Would you like me to show you around? This place really has quite a history. - [John] I'd like that very much. - John, do you mind if I just stay here for a while? - Is that alright, Mrs. Abercrombi? I feel dizzy for some reason. - Are you sure you're okay? - Oh, yeah, it's nothing. - [Agnes] You're not sick, are you, child? - Oh, it's nothing, (chuckles) I just, I'd just like to sit here and I'll catch up with you in a minute, okay? - Okay. You catch up when you're feeling okay, alright? - Alright. - Alright. (chuckles) (dark tones) (muffled chatter) (suspenseful music) - What does she need all this for? (dark tones) John? Mrs. Abercrombi! (dark tones) (muffled clunks) (muffled clunks) John? (steel dings) - John! (ominous music) (intense chords) (doors slam) (Jenny gasps) John! (suspenseful music) John! (suspenseful music) - Jenny? Hey, what're you doin' up there? - I'm looking for you! - Well, come on down, we'll meet you out in front, okay? - [Agnes] Careful, child, that's an old building! - Okay! Hi. - Hi, welcome down. - You're feeling better, child? You're still looking a little pale. - No, I'm much better, thank you. - You missed a great tour. - Oh, but there's still the main banquet hall, come along. - Come on. Now, this is the great kitchen, where they supplied food for all the dining halls in the spa. Three dining halls and the restaurants. It is a terrible mess. It used to be shining. - Hi, I'm a side of peas. (women laugh) Your (mumbles), m'lady. - Oh, thank you very much. - [John] My lady, that's as far as I go. - [Agnes] When this refrigerator was first put in here, it was the largest thing anybody had ever seen. - Oh. It is huge. - Yes, very large. It's a shame. - Oh! (Agnes laughs) - Come on, you two, let's get out of here. (suspenseful music) - Mrs. Abercrombi! What's in these rooms? - Oh, those doors have been locked ever since I can remember, child. The keys have been rusted and rots for years. Come on, let's get out in the sunshine. - Jenny? Well, thank you very much for the tour. It was really fascinating, but I guess we better get going if we wanna get back before it gets dark. - Well, thank you both, I enjoyed your company. I'm sorry I startled you, child. - Oh, that's okay, it was my fault, really. - Nonsense, now you take care of yourself. I think you may be coming down with a fever. - I will. - Thanks again for everything. - You're welcome, come again sometime. - Maybe we will, bye bye. (ominous tones) (smooth jazz music) (Jenny gasps) Hello. - Oh. Do you make a habit of dropping in on people? - Well, it does get their attention. - Oh, no kidding. Hey, I was wondering when I was gonna see you again. - Hey, look, I'm sorry. I've been really busy down at the paper. - That's another thing, I called that paper where you work, and the person I talked to didn't know who you were. - Oh, well, you probably spoke to the front desk. Well, they don't know me up there. (chuckles) I'm always in the back in the features sections. Well, anyway, I was looking for you today. I've got a surprise for ya. - Oh, not another Groucho the Spy all-expense-paid picnic is it? - Nope, better than that. A whole day with me ending with dinner on the town. - Hm, sounds promising, when? - Saturday. - Well, I think I'm free. - I know you are. (Jenny laughs) - Well, you're right, where are we gonna go? - Well, that's the catch. - Okay. What're you holding back, where are you gonna take me? - Soda Spring Spa. - John, no. Oh, John, you know I don't like that place. - I know, I know, but listen. This is a great opportunity for me. I told my editor about the place and he thinks it's a perfect subject for a story in the features section. - Oh, that place gives me the creeps. - Oh, come on, please? I mean, this is my first chance to do some actual writing. Next time you can pick the place. - Really? - I promise! And it won't be so bad, I mean, after I get a few pictures and get the facts from the old lady, we can drive our cars back to the city for dinner. - Our cars? - Yeah, that's the other thing. See, I'll be doing some work north of there and I thought maybe you could drive your own car and meet me out in front. - John, couldn't I go with you? - You can't, it's somebody else's story! I'm just taking photos. I wish you could, but it's impossible. Look, I really wanna spend the day with you. It would mean a lot to me. Please? (smooth jazz music) - Okay. (chuckles) What time? - [John] 12 o'clock. - [Jenny] You better be there. - [John] I'll be there before you, for sure! - You better be. That rat. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (leaves rustle) (gun fires) (screams) - (gasps) Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. - God, this is getting to be a habit. I'm okay. - [Man] Oh, I didn't expect to see anybody here. I didn't hear you coming. And I had a quale right in my sights. - I'm glad you didn't have me in your sights. Doesn't Mrs. Abercrombi mind you hunting here? - Who? - The old lady who lives here. - No one lives here. No one's lived here since the place closed down, and that was in the early 30s. In fact, no one even likes to come near here. I'm about the only one who ever does. But I don't believe all that nonsense. And generally, the hunt's pretty good. Not that the deer hunting is much, but-- - [Jenny] What nonsense? - What? - You said that you didn't believe all that nonsense. - Oh, I've always said that's just foolish talk. - What kind of talk? - Back in 1930 or so, on the 50th anniversary of the opening of the spa, they had a huge ball and a banquet to celebrate. The owner's daughter had been married that afternoon so they made her the guest of honor. Well, when everything was ready for the banquet and everyone was ready to start, the girl was nowhere to be found. So, they waited and waited and, finally, they started the banquet without her. And then, after everybody had finished eating, a couple of the guests went out into the kitchen to congratulate the cook on the wonderful dinner. And they found that, uh, well... - Yes? - Well, they found that the cook had killed the girl, and cooked her and had fed her to the guests. - Oh, my god. (man chuckles) - That's my sentiments exactly. But as the story goes, that was the end of the spa. It closed that night and never opened again. - Why did the cook kill the girl? - They never figured that out and they never caught her. - Her? Is this story true? - No, of course not. (chuckles) I think it's all legend and not fact, but the old people in the valley really believe it. There's people who swear that they've seen the ghost of that bride, out here, walking around in a white wedding dress. And people have come out here and were never seen again. And a lot of other such nonsense. But I figure that the spa closed because, well, they just ran out of money. - Yeah. I like that reason best. (man laughs) (horn honks) - Oh, that must be John. Oh, he's a friend of mine, I'm supposed to meet him here. Well, thank you for everything, and for not shooting me. - My pleasure. (chuckles) - Goodbye. - Hey, wait. This is the quickest way out to the front. It's faster goin' through here. Now, this is the back of the main building, and you can cut right through here. Kinda spooky, isn't it? (Jenny chuckles) - I thought you didn't believe in the story? - Well, I don't believe it, but it's still kinda spooky. Right down there and to the right. - Okay, thank you very much for everything. - Don't mention it. - I hope I see you again. - Well, I hope I see you, too. - Bye bye. - Bye bye. (ominous music) (steel dings) (ominous chord) (screams) - [John] I'm sorry I was late! Have you been here long? - Yes, but John, listen, everything's gone. - Gone? - When I got here and you weren't here and nothing else was either, I thought I was going out of my mind. (dark tones) - Oh, hello! What a delightful surprise! - [John] Hello, Mrs. Abercrombi. - Are you feeling better today, child? I was worried about you. - [Jenny] Yes, I'm fine. - Well, it's so nice to see the two of ya again. Come on in, I'm just puttin' on a pot of tea! - [John] I'd love some. - You've got to believe me. Just a few minutes ago there was nothing here. She wasn't here and the room was completely empty-- - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hold on. You must've come in the wrong way. You mistook an empty guest house for hers. - No, I didn't! - Well, then how do you explain it? - I don't know. I don't know, I just don't like it here, John. Please, let's go. - Now you're being silly. Look, relax. Are you feelin' okay? - Oh, damnit, I'm fine. - Okay. Just must've made a mistake. - Tea's ready! Come on in. - We'll be in in a second. Are you okay? - Oh, I guess. It's just that I, I was so sure. I guess it's possible. (ominous tones) - You two must think I'm an awful housekeeper. Every time you come here, the place is a mess. - Don't be silly, it looks fine. - Now, tell me. What brings you two back here so soon? Such an unexpected pleasure. - Well, when I got back, I was talkin' to my editor about-- - [Agnes] Your editor? Do you work for a magazine? - Newspaper. - Oh. Here, dear, be careful, it's very hot. - See, I don't exactly work for them yet. I mean, I don't write. - Here you go. - Thank you, but I think I've got my chance now. I think I can do it and I think I'll get it. The editor thinks that the resort would be a perfect-- - Put some sugar in it. - No, thank you. - Go on, put some sugar in it. - Okay. - [John] So, if you're interested, I brought my tape recorder and I'll take a few pictures, and ask a few questions. - Better. Now, you were saying? (John chuckles) - Oh, well, my editor thinks that the resort here would be a perfect subject for a feature story in the Sunday section. So, I brought my camera and my tape recorder and if I can impose on you for a little longer, I'd like to ask you a few questions. - [Agnes] Of course, I find the whole thing so exciting. - Good. - Say, listen. I have something that might interest you, young man. I have a scrapbook with old pictures of this resort. - I'd love to see it. - Yep. There's a picture in here of my father. Here, let's shove this stuff along here. And some of those carriages I was telling you about. Now, let's see, let me see. There, yes, yes! - Oh, that's beautiful. - Isn't that lovely? - [John] I wish you could see when it's all like that. - Yes, but you see-- (cup clatters) - Oh, excuse me. (tense music) I think I need some air. - Are you alright, child? You look awful pale. - I just feel dizzy again. I'll go outside for a while. - Hey, Jenny. You want me to come with you? - Oh, no. No, get your story, I'm sorry. I'll just be outside, I'll be fine in a minute. - Okay. - [Woman] Jenny! (suspenseful music) Jenny! (ominous music) Jenny! (suspenseful music) Jenny! (muffled scraping) (ominous music) (glass smashes) (Jenny screams) (muffled clunks) (hammering thuds) (suspenseful music) (Jenny screams) - Jenny! Jenny! Jen, she's down here! Jenny. - [Agnes] Child, what happened? - We heard a scream, what happened? - Oh, god, that ax! - It's okay. It's okay, I'm here. Why'd you faint, what happened? - He was after me and I, I got trapped in this room! And, and he was gonna kill me! - Who? - The, the man with the ax! And someone else! - But where? There's no one here! - He was upstairs, upstairs, and then he ran down here after me! - Whoa, your wrist, how'd you do that? - Oh, child, you probably cut it when you fainted. You better come back to my rooms. - No, no, let me show you! - Hey, Mrs. Abercrombi's right. - No, I have to show you! - Jenny! Jenny, please. - John, they were here! There was that girl and there was this grindstone-- - Jenny, come on, let's go back to Mrs. Abercrombi's and you can lie down. - I think you must have a fever. Oh, you're burning! Come, child. - [Jenny] But they were here, where could they have gone to? - Jenny, Jenny, come on, there's no one here! Come on, you need to lie down. - But... (dark tones) I'm alright, really. - [John] All the same, you stay here and rest. - John, will you go to the kitchen and get the rag next to the sink? - Sure. - It's just a scratch! - That's no scratch, child. It should be bandaged properly, and when you get back home, you go see a doctor. - Here, I can do it. - No, let me. - No. - How is that fever, child? I think you could be coming down with the flu. Sun's about to set, be dark in an hour. - We'll have to be going soon. - Going? - Well, we planned to go back to the city for dinner. - Oh, my, I won't stand for that. You stay here and have dinner with me. And spend the night, too. - No! - Jenny needs the rest, and besides, you don't need any dinner in that foggy city. You'll be pneumonia for sure. - That's a very generous offer, but I'm afraid we can't accept. We'd be an imposition. - Oh, no. It would give me the greatest pleasure. - But you weren't planning on three for dinner. - [John] And besides, there isn't room for us here. - Oh, yes, there is, there are two cottages, where my relatives used to stay when they visited me. All they need are pillows and some blankets. Of course, I'm afraid it's a little dusty now. - That's very kind, Mrs. Abercrombi, but-- - Now hush, child. I insist, you need the rest. It's all decided, I won't hear anything more! I'm going out now and make the beds. (whistles jauntily) - John? - I'm in here! - Hi. - Hi. - [Jenny] How is it in there? - A little dusty. (chuckles) It's not bad, it's no hotel. Hold on a second. Thank you. - On second thought, I'll wear it. Thank you, sir. (smooth jazz music) - You still sorry we're staying? - Oh, well, I'm just so confused, with everything that's been happening to me. - Everything you think's been happening to you. - Okay, so there's no proof, but, it doesn't prove that it didn't happen and, and it doesn't change one thing. - [John] What's that? - That I saw Mrs. Abercrombi coming out of that padlocked room that she told us she didn't have the key for. - Jenny, you gotta believe me. Mrs. Abercrombi was with me the whole time, talking about the resort. She didn't leave until we heard you scream. - Well, it doesn't change what I saw. And after what the hunter said-- - Wait, wait a minute. (chuckles) I thought you just told me that the hunter didn't believe that story himself? - Yeah, but-- - But nothing. Come on. Now look, Jenny, you've just gotta relax. You've probably got a touch of some bug that's going around and it's plying tricks on you. - Maybe so. Anyway, I, I'm glad I'm not here alone. - You know, abandoned swimming pools always intrigued me. - When I found one when I was little, I used to jump in and pretend I was a Christian being thrown to the lions. - No, no, no, no, no! - What? - No, with me it's the scene at the monster movie when the heroine is finally trapped by the grotesque beast. - (laughs) In a swimming pool? - Sure! (screams) (tense music) Step by step. Closer and closer. (Jenny giggles) The beast came to our heroine, poor Miss Betty Lou. Until, at last, there was nowhere left to go, and she was trapped. (Jenny yelps) (Jenny giggles) With the final step, the beast licked his lips in anticipation. - Oh. (chuckles) - [John] And snorted. (snorts) (Jenny screams) Then... (Jenny chuckles) He looked down at her, with an emotion he had never felt before. Was it love? Anger, pity, greed? - (laughs) Okay. - [John] A certain tenderness, shall we say. And with this tenderness, he picked our heroine up-- (Jenny screams) And carried her off. To a cave-- (Jenny screams) - Oh, no! - But at that very moment! Our hero appears on the scene. - Oh! - Brave. Young. Intelligent. Trustworthy. Loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean-- - Okay, okay! (giggles) - And reverent. Our hero, Dr. Bradley, who just happens to be the creator of this hideous thing, cognizant of the evil he has reaped upon an unsuspecting world, and now that his creature threatens the one thing in the world he loves, besides science, has come to do battle with the hideous monster. Slowly, he approaches him. The thing rears up. (roars) (Jenny screams) He approaches again, the thing rears up. (roars) "Come here, you beast, lay hands off of her." "You mean me?" "Yes, you, you hideous creature." "Don't be rude." "Take that, and that!" (Jenny yelps) "Take that, and that!" "That that!" And the girl gets the upper hand and with a heroic plunge, dives his knife into the creature's heart. (Jenny screams) - [Jenny] Oh. My hero! - It was nothing. - Oh! (giggles) - And slowly, the hero takes the heroine into his arms, for the ultimate kiss, and final pay out. (gentle orchestral music) But can it be? Why, our hero is no hero at all. But Dracula's nephew. (Jenny laughs) Out for a bite. - Oh, you never stop. (John grunts) Oh. (chuckles) Oh, John. (laughs) (John grunts) Come on, John. Okay. (John grunts) Come on. (John grunts) Please? (John grunts) Come on. (John grunts) Stop. (John grunts) Okay, stop! (John grunts) Please stop. (John grunts) Please stop! Please stop! (John grunts) John, please! (John grunts) Please! (John grunts) - One more way to get attention. (smooth jazz music) - [Agnes] Done! Yoo-hoo! - [Jenny] What do you think will happen to the resort, Mrs. Abercrombi? - I don't know, I've always hoped someone would come along and be interested in offering to fix it up like it used to be, you know, paint it and wallpaper it, and fix up the lovely old gardens and the walls. Oh, but nobody feels like that toward a place like this anymore. No, those days are gone. - This meal is superb. You shouldn't have gone to so much trouble. - I'm glad you enjoy it. Wasn't any trouble, you know, cooking's really my hobby. - Well, this is fantastic. - I'm glad you like it. - What kind of meat is this, Mrs. Abercrombi, is it beef? - No. - Well, then lamb or pork? - No. - (chuckles) What is it, then? - It's an old secret family recipe. - Oh. (chuckles) - I call it hunter's stew. It'd spoil all the fun if I told you how I made it. - Well, it's delicious, so before I go, do you promise you'll tell me how to make it? - Yes. I promise to tell you how I made it before you go. - Okay. (John and Jenny sigh) - Now, anybody for some wine? - Oh, I'd love some. - Oh. - You, child? - Oh, thank you very much. - Oh, good, good! (ominous music) There we go! - I propose a toast. To the hospitality of our generous hostess. - [John] Yes, indeed. - Thank you! (ominous music) What a clumsy fool I-- - Here, let me get it. - Yes. How unfortunate. Please don't make me stay, let's go tonight. - Jenny, don't get yourself all excited again. - [Jenny] Please! - There's gotta be a perfectly logical explanation for, for everything that you think's been happening to you. You've probably got a fever and you're overtired. - Oh, please, John! - There's nothing wrong! Believe me. I'll take care of you. I'm sorry nothing ever works out the way I planned it. It's the story of my life. - Some dinner in the city. - Yeah. (chuckles) What you need now is rest, I'll be right nextdoor. Tonight, you get some sleep and then tomorrow, we'll try and figure things out. We'll find your hunter friend, we'll go see what we can find out in town about our Mrs. Abercrombi, okay? - You promise you'll help me check it out? - Cross my heart and hope to die. - Don't say that. - What's this? - I don't know, it was here. I guess she left it for me to wear. - (chuckles) Really? Hey, come on, let me see it. Well, it's not exactly Playboy. - Thank goodness. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - I'll be right nextdoor. - You better. (wolf howls) (gravel crunches) (gravel crunches) (gravel crunches) (gravel crunches) (suspenseful music) (gravel crunches) (gravel crunches) (door rattles) (gravel crunches) (gravel crunches) (screams) (ominous tones) (suspenseful music) (ax thuds) (wood snaps) (screams) - Hey, what happened? - The ax man was trying to get me again! - Where? - He was outside the door! Chopping at the door, trying to get in! - Jenny, listen, there was no one outside when I got here. - He had to be there! - Jenny! - Look at the door, the door... No, it had to be! - Come on, Jenny, lie down. - No, you don't believe me! - Come on, lie down, you'll feel better in the morning. - You have to believe me! - Jenny, please. - You don't believe me. - Jenny, please. - Here, give her this, I put a sedative in it. - I won't drink anything she gives me, get out! - Jenny-- - Get out! Get out, both of you! - Come on. Let's leave her alone, we're only making her worse. - Shouldn't we help her? - No, we'll come back in the morning, come on. (Jenny sobs) (door opens) (strong wind blows) (suspenseful music) - Jenny. Come with me. Watch her house, Jenny. - Gah, you fools, you fools, you fool! Get outta here! I suspected you'd foul this thing up! Every time, everything was going perfectly. Now get out of here! There's only one more thing to do! Get out of here and get her! Go on, get her! - [Bride] Get the key to the padlocked room. That will prove it to John. (suspenseful music) (glass clinks) - Where are you? (footsteps approach) Oh, good lad. Now, listen. Everything must be exactly the same as I told you. Most important, the circle. - Don't worry, it will be. But why do we need all this? We didn't have to with the others-- - The others were not the same. She must be just like that first bride. - [John] Okay. - Now, remember, we waited for tonight for a reason. So that it can be just the same. She must die between midnight and six in the morning. Not a second before or after. I'm having trouble with our helpers, they're too anxious. They could spoil everything. Now, remember. Most important. The circle. She must enter it, without us forcing her. Understood? - What about Luther and the others? - [Agnes] If they're here by midnight, fine. If not, we won't wait a second for them. (tense music) (Jenny moans) (steel clangs) (door thuds) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (key clangs) (door creaks) (ominous music) (Jenny screams) - Did you find what you're looking for, Jenny? (laughs) (laughs) - Jenny! - Again. - Jenny, help! Jenny, help! - Oh, god, they've got John. (suspenseful music) (footsteps clunk) (screams) No. Don't come any closer. I'll shoot you. Please. Please. Please. (man grunts) (gun fires) (ominous tones) (suspenseful music) (sobs) (screams) - Jenny! - John. How did you get away? - Doesn't matter. Come on, we've gotta get outta here. - John, look out! Oh, god, not you. (suspenseful music) - I'm sorry, Jenny, but you are so perfect. (Jenny yelps) - [Jenny] No. No! (whines) No! (screams) (moans) (suspenseful music) - She's waking. - Ah-ha, good. It's almost midnight. I wanted her to be awake. - What about Luther and the others? - I told you, we weren't going to wait for them. - Then let's start. - Oh, we have to wait till midnight. - But that drug may wear off at any time. We don't know how much we got in her. - Enough did. I don't want to hurry and spoil this. We worked too long lookin' for one as perfect as her. (laughs) Fine, child! I'm so glad you could join us. Although, it's a shame after John and I worked so long and hard lookin' for someone like you, you're not going to be with us very long. - It's no use, Jenny. That shot we gave you was a local anesthetic. You can see and hear fine, but you can't move your body at all. - (chuckles) Frustratin', isn't it, child? But you have no idea how frustrating it's been for John and me, waiting all this time for this night. This special night. Ah, but it was well worth it. Oh! Oh, I must thank you for being so generous, with that blood for the circle. - [John] It's almost time. - Fine, child. In a moment, you're going to learn the recipe for my hunter's stew. (ominous tones) (tense music) Now, child, you are one of us. (clock chimes) Die, child! (dramatic music) (groans) (suspenseful music) (car engine churns) (car engine churns) (car starts) (man grunts) (ominous music) (tires screech) (sirens wail) - [Jenny] Agnes Abercrombi, then you'll believe me. She lives in here. - [Deputy] Well, if she does live here, she sure is a messy house keeper. - [Sheriff] Are you sure you're in the right room? - [Jenny] God damnit, she lives here! It's just that, everything's gone. - [Deputy] So, this is where it all happened, huh? - It was right here! It was all here! I don't understand. - [Sheriff] How about tellin' us the truth? - It happened! It happened! It happened! It happened! It happened! (sobs) - [Sheriff] You haven't taken any funny drugs, have ya? - [Deputy] Hey, Sheriff. Sheriff, look what I found, I don't think this little lady's been tellin' us the whole truth. - [Sheriff] That's sure enough marijuana. - That's not mine! - [Sheriff] Well, it's your car, ain't it? - Yes, it's my car, but those are not mine! - [Sheriff] I'm afraid you'll have to wait here a while-- - Sheriff, this little lady don't deserve no private cell. Put her down there with the other one. - Don't worry, miss, you won't be here long. (dark tones) (door slams) (Jenny sighs) - Wonder how long I'll have to be here. (dark tones) - Just long enough, my child. (Jenny screams) (bell tolls) (bell tolls) (bell tolls) (bell tolls) (bell tolls)
