Fuck it. Hey. - How you doing today? - Good, what can I get for you? - I have a reservation with Mattan or an interview with Mattan. - An interview? - Yeah. - Really? Mattan. - Lloyd, seriously what have I told you about yelling in front of customers? - I'm not yelling. - Hi, Crispin? - Yes, that's right. - [Mattan] Right, how's it going? - Good. - Couple of questions. Have you ever made a pizza? - No, I've never actually made one, but I'm a quick learner. - Second question. Have you ever had a job? - No, this would be my first one if I were to get it. - I'll get you a shirt. - Wait, what do you mean a shirt? - A tee shirt like that. He doesn't know what tee shirts are, Mattan. (bright music) - Hey hon, did you eat? I haven't had time to go to the grocery store yet, but I know we have some salami and that bread you like. - Yeah, yeah, I got the job. - You did? I'm so excited for you. Oh by the way, have you called your dad? He needs help. - Fantastic. I gotta go. I'm gonna be late. - Okay, bye, I love you. - Love you, too. (upbeat music) Oh God, could you be... - [Anthony] Don't. (upbeat music) Of course I dropped it. It was at eight, Crispin. - [Crispin] I think that officially means you've dropped more class than you've been to. - It's just unnatural for me to get up that early. There's nothing I can do about it. It's before my normal waking cycle. - What the fuck is a waking cycle? - It's before my normal waking cycle, Crispin. What don't you understand about that and what am I even supposed to do? I wake up, I'm clueless. I'm literally pointless in class. I get in. I get it to the desk. I finally get to my desk. Literally, get there, sit down, and then it's just over for me. That's it for the rest of the time. - Fuck, I'm gonna be late. - Oh Crispin, you going to The Ridge tonight? - Why, so we can stand around and look through our phone in hopes we can find a girl bored enough to blow us in the backseat of your car that we don't even fit into only to find that they can't come 'cause they're busy blowing the one guy that didn't answer our phone calls? - Yeah, but there's still that wonderful chance. - Yeah, I'll see you there. (soft music) - Since then, she's texted me a total of three times. That means three out of three times, she wanted to talk to me first. She also liked 13 of my photos and I didn't like a single one of hers. - Whoa bro, 13. That's an unlucky number, man. - No, that means I won. - No, no you lost. For sure. - No, she's crawling back to me. - No, if you texted her 'cause you're a guy, you'd be crawling back yeah, but she's a girl and she texted you first, which means she's like a better person for staying in contact with you. - [Jason] Well, I always did think she was a better person. - I never texted a girl first in my life. - Shut up, Tim. You don't like Harry Potter. You lost your right to speak. - Yeah, plus you don't text 'em. They just appear in your room. - Yeah, they just disapparate right in. You don't what that is because you don't like Harry Potter. Fuck you, Tim. - Anthony, you can watch Harry Potter all night once we get that new place. - [Crispin] New place? - Yeah, we got one on Deerfield, Culver, Yale. Oh, and the one by Frank's old place. - Oh yeah, I like that one. - [Crispin] Dude, what the fuck? Those are all in the same city. - Well I can't leave the city. I got school and why do you even care? - I mean, I can't leave 'cause of Rachel. - You don't even have any more classes left to drop. - Transfer. - Oh man. You really don't think I won though? - Yo. Not a single girl coming. (gentle music) - [Shades] What? What are you doing? What? What are you doing? Look, stop, stop, stop. You just. It's sad. It really is sad watching you do this. Look, you ever seen "Goodfellas?" You know the part where Joe Pesci stabs the guy? Well you just gotta get in there like that, like that. Like that. And you're done. You're officially off your period. - How have you been here longest again? - [Shades] How do your face look like the genitals of everybody... - You know we make pizza right? - [Mattan] Crispin. - We make pizza. - [Mattan] Come with me. - P-I-Z-Z-A. - I wanna teach you how to run the front, all right? This girl right here, she needs a little loving. - [Lloyd] You treat her like a lady, Mattan. Like a lady. - All right, one more time. A little nudge. (cash register beeping) There you go. Hello sir. - How old are those? - They've been out for a bit, but we can always warm 'em up in the oven if you like. - How long is a bit? - Well, I'm not exactly sure how long they've been out, but it can't have been a long time. Do you want a slice, sir? - Yeah, two cheese and is there a bathroom around here? - Unfortunately we do not, sir, but if you go across the parking lot, there's one in Yogurt World. - [Lloyd] Fuck Yogurt World. (bright music) - All right. - Thanks. - Oh my God. Have these orders been made? (bell chiming) (gentle music) - [Crispin] Hello, how can I help you today? - I ordered a pizza for delivery two and a half hours ago and it still hasn't come. - I am so sorry. - I want my money back. Now. - That shouldn't be a problem. Let me just run and get a manager real quick. - What, they don't teach everyone how to open the register? 27.95, that's how much you owe me. Just open the register, pull it out and give it to me. - Just let me grab a manager. It's my first day and I don't wanna... - You know what, nah. If you need your manager that bad, I'll just go get him. - Wait, what do you mean? What do you mean get him? - [Shades] Sup, Sierra? - [Sierra] Shades. - [Shades] All right, later. - [Crispin] Okay, so you work here? - [Sierra] Yeah. - [Crispin] Okay. What was your name? I didn't... - Sierra. And don't worry I can handle the front now. - Oh got you. Nice meeting you and well played, Sierra. (bright music) - [Anthony] You ain't big. You ain't big. - Oh yeah I am. - [Anthony] You ain't big. You ain't big. - Guess what. It's back on with Rachel. - So you're gonna pretend that's still a thing? - So she's grabbing stuff out of my car, right. She comes across this flashlight. She grabs the flashlight, hands it to me, and our hands touch, right? And at first I don't really notice it, but then I realize she could've grabbed that flashlight at any point, but she chose to grab it right where I was naturally gonna grab it. - Are you serious? You just bumped hands. That doesn't mean shit. - I'm serious as syphilis, Crispin. It didn't have to be a flashlight. It could've been anything. That's not important. What's important was the intention. - [Adam] Yo, what's up, guys? - What up? - Is that Northwood Pizza? - Yup. - Why, why? Why did you get Northwood Pizza? - Well to get a discount from you. - I told you even if I'm there, which I'm not, I can't get you a fucking discount yet, dude. - It's all good. I got one from this hot chick Sara anyway. - [Crispin] Ah, Sierra. - Hey Adam. If Rachel touched my hand on purpose when she was giving me something, does that mean it's back on? - [Adam] Congratulations. - Case in point. You got the same opinion as Adam. Anthony, you're fucking awful. - I'm the best there ever was. - So, every move a woman makes is methodically planned out. Nine out of 10 times they're days ahead of us. They don't just do things. - [Crispin] False. Even more false than your stupid flashlight. - Every move is planned out. If I was aware of it, she was too, you know. Her touching my hand today is probably setting up something months from now. - You know he's right. - Adam, who even told you we were here right now? - [Anthony] Ow. - Oh wait, wait. Are you okay? - Oh yeah, I just gotta go. I got. I got parents. They got things. - Find a nickel. - Fuck you, Adam. - Can I bum? Bum a stoge off you. - Yeah dude, no problem. - A stoge. A stoge art. Humphrey Stogart. I didn't like it either. Give me that. Okay. Here you go. You know what really traps my ass, man? - What's that? - So, I'm talking to this girl, right. Text her. It's nothing serious. It's brand new. She's pretty cute, I guess. Sent me a picture, some emojis. I sent her back some emojis. It's nothing serious. We know nothing about each other at this point, okay. Nothing. I know nothing about her. So we're talking. - Hey, brother. Think I can bum a cigarette? - Yeah, of course, dude. In fact, take two so you can like the first one more. - Appreciate it. (energetic music) - Where is Shades? He always does this and then I have to do his work. - Hey Mattan. - [Mattan] Hey. Where is Shades? Oh my God, has this freezer been unplugged all day? - So, we're talking, right. I'm trying to figure out exactly what kind of woman this girl is, you know. Is she smart? Is she a bitch? Is she gonna do my taxes for me? These are the things I need to know as a person. So, the thing is I actually know how to find this out. I know exactly how to find this out. - How do you find that out? - One simple all informative question, Crispin. - What's your favorite "Star Wars" movie? (bright music) - Yeah, that's exactly right. How did you know that? - It's obvious. - Did we just become lovers? (bell chiming) That means you gotta go help them. - Oh. - What have you been here a week? Go, come on. Go. - How can I help you today, sir? - Hey, I put an order in not too long ago. It's probably not ready. I'm here pretty early. - Yeah, no problem at all. What was your name? - Hayden. - So anyway. I asked her the question. - Shades, you son of a bitch. Where are you? I can't believe you're pulling this shit again. It's a disaster down here. - [Shades] It's Thursday. - It is Thursday. And you don't work Thursday. - [Shades] Bye. (bright music) - And what'd she say? - [Crispin] All right man, here you go. Here's your pizza. - [Lloyd] "Attack of the Clones". - "Attack of the Clones". On purpose? Like actually? - Actually sent me that text. That was a thing that happened? She picked a prequel. That's already bad enough. I can deal with the other two. It's fine. They're all right. But "Attack of the Clones". It's actually like she kind of like purposely tried to piss you off. - I'm really sorry about that. That was unnecessary and I'm sorry about the pizza. Thanks, guys. - Wow. That was actually pretty cool. (gentle music) - Eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Ha, I win again. Losers clean up. - [Man] Oh, but you guys, lag is horrible. (energetic music) - Crispin, thank God. Listen. I got orders out the ass and I'm the only fucking person here. Can you do a delivery for me? - Like now? - Yes, like now, like right now. Like right goddamn now. Can you do a delivery for me? - Yeah, I mean. - Okay, good, take it here. The address is on there. Just go, okay. Just go, you'll be fine. - My car's out of gas. - Sh, sh, sh, sh. Shut the fuck up, okay. Go, good. - Okay. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Most important thing, okay. You get the money first and then you give 'em the pie, okay. Money first. - Money first. - Then the pie. You got it? - Yeah. - Make me proud. (upbeat music) - [Customer] Yeah, come in. Just put it on the counter. I'll be out in a sec. - Cool, this counter's fine? - [Customer] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just anywhere. How much do I owe you? - That'll be 27.95. - [Customer] No, all right. I can't fucking go five times in a row, all right. A man needs fucking juice, okay. Finally, Jesus fucking Christ. - Frank? Adam's friend. We like went to school together and stuff. - Oh, Christian. What's up, man? Look at you. You got like chin hair and shit. Get over here. Come here, baby. Let me. Aw yeah. Ooh, dude. I like that. - Yeah, dude, I didn't know you moved back. - Moved back? Baby, I never left. - [Woman] He left? - No, I said that I never left. - [Woman] Oh because (speaks in foreign language). Fuck you. - What? - [Woman] Ugh, you're deaf. - No, I'm not deaf. That I didn't hear everything you say. - What the fuck did you say? - That I don't listen to anything you say. - [Woman] One more fucking time. - If I listened to everything that you said, my ears would fucking rot. - Everything I said. You just said anything I said. - So? - You know what, Frank? You're a fucking coward. You know that? You're always backing down. - Yeah 'cause you're fucking manlier than me. Look at you with those fucking gigantic gigantour fucking boobs everywhere just flailing around like you own the place. - Honestly, do you mind if I just grab the money? - [Woman] Do you mind... - Not a problem at all. - [Woman] Say that one more fucking time. - Whoa. I didn't know I was fucking a broken record this whole time. - Is that what you call fucking? - Honestly, if I can just grab the money and go, wouldn't be a big deal. - Fucking hate you. - Fuck you. - Get the fuck over here. Get the fuck over here. Fuck, yeah baby. - [Woman] Woo. Oh Frank. Oh. (bright music) - Hey. Did you get it? (bright music) Is this the tip? (soft music) - Nice wheels. Car itself looks like it barely made it here though. - Oh these ones? It made it though because I put hamsters in it. - Oh. - And that's why it made it here. - Knew it was something about the wheels. Turns out it was the animal cruelty I was attracted to. - You know, animal cruelty. It's American way. Can I use your lighter? - Yeah. - Thank you. - Good. You get it. Cigarettes with white filters are not cigarettes. - Well of course. Just like pterodactyls aren't dragons. - That seems rehearsed. - No, it is. I don't get out much. I sit around and I just make these elaborate scenarios in my head. I play 'em out and then I memorize them and I just hope to God that it happens one day. - I blame the 2000s. - What year were you born? - 95. Do you consider yourself a 90s kid or a 2000s kid? - I don't know. What age do you have to be during which decade? - I don't know for sure but everyone from Woodstock says they're from the 60s and they were like fucking 20. - Okay, so we're from the 2000s. - [Crispin] Boom of the internet. - That's right. I'm definitely from the AOL and Myspace era. - Does that mean we're from the generation of first failed attempts? - You don't seem like you are. Hey Garza. Got some allergies there? Your eyes look a little red. - I'm stoned. You know what really chaps my ass? - What's that? - [Garza] They're gonna shut down All Star Donuts. - What? The one by Antonio's and the fucking Chinese place? - Yeah. - That's a shame. - No, I know. Sickening. Absolutely sickening. - It's at an ass chapping. - [Garza] It is. It is. (soft music) - Mattan. - Did you put the orders in for the tomatoes yet? (upbeat music) (bell chiming) - Fuck. - Hey Lloyd. - Hey Crispin. - How's it hanging? - Long, hairy, and hard to carry, man. - Fuck, man. Yeah, I've been meaning to ask you actually. What's up with the picture by the pinball machine? - Oh that. That's the danger. - Everyone knows the legend, Crispin. - Yeah, that AJ guy worked here years ago. Then he stopped working, grabbed this, set a new high score, walked out, and no one's seen him since. Or beat his stupid score. - What's his score? - 79,812 that fucker scored. Every single person whose ever worn a Northwood Pizza tee shirt has tried to beat it. No one's even come close. - How hard could that shit be? It's a pinball machine. - You asking that proves you're not ready. None of us on the same level as the danger. Be the stupid fucking shiny ball. Okay. - How do I not know about this danger? - "The" danger and I have no clue. It's actually very sad. (soft music) Have you heard that they're opening a Five Guys down the street? Supposedly the first one on the left coast. - Oh, I had not heard that actually and please don't ever fucking say left coast again. (soft music) - [Sierra] Yeah, it's supposed to be really, really good. - Is it now? - Mm hm, I really wanna try it. - Yeah, that sounds interesting. I would try that. - Actually you wanna try it with me this weekend? - I can't. Or what? I totally can. I don't know why I said. Yeah, I can do that next weekend. - All right, but of course I won't be paying for you. (soft music) - Yeah. Ah. Are you serious? All right, it's on. (bright music) - So the other week I went to this modern art museum. I'm gonna be honest. I didn't get it. I didn't get a lot of it. - Yeah. - There was just a lot of it is just random painting. - [Crispin] I got pizza. - [Jason] Awesome. - Jesus, about time. - I only got like five minutes. - All right, well let's talk about it. I was right. Girls know exactly what they're doing. - Yeah, they do. - 100 bucks says you blew it. You've never been a closer. - What do you mean I'm not a closer? What does he mean I'm not a closer? - [Jason] It's okay. Some girls like awkward. - What do you mean awkward? - Off the top of my head there's Caroline, Lindsay. - Claire. Thank you, Jason. - Why, why? - [Jason] Come on. - Are you mad at me? Did I do something? - Well you got cum on Alicia's dog and you didn't even get her undressed. - That's disgusting. How do you even do that? - And then you puked on Julia and you weren't even drunk at that time. I don't know how you do that. - So I don't get sushi. - Oh, oh. And then you start hitting on Jocelyn's mom. - Okay in my defense, I honestly thought it was Jocelyn, so it's not as creepy as you think it is. - They do look like the same from behind. - Yeah, it's a simple mistake. I'd make the same mistake, too. - Rahim, we do one slice. Not two. - We spoke about this. I get one slice before. - Rahim, just give me the homework. - No, I'm not giving you. Why don't you do the homework? - Well then I'd have to go to class to do that. - Great. - Ah, so you admit it. You don't go to class. You have no excuses not to move. - Oh please. I got tons of classes and I found all the places. - The places you found are down the fucking street. I can see one from here right now. - Why do you even wanna move? It's like you're never even happy with where you are. - That's really deep. Wow. I wish I'd thought of that. - Rahim, what are you even doing here? (speaking in foreign language) - What's (speaks in foreign language)? What is that? You say that to me all the time. I don't speak Spanish. - Oh, you have a visitor. - Hey, Jason. I was just wondering what you were doing later. If maybe you wanted to go get some boba. - Jennifer, we already talked about this. You know where my heart belongs. I'm not gonna get boba with you. - Jennifer. It's a lovely dress you're wearing. Maybe he's a little stubborn. Maybe I can take you to boba sometime. Jennifer. - [Jennifer] Just stop it. - Jennifer, just to make him jealous maybe. - Okay, that's it. I'm not listening to you about anything. You're the new advice man. - Jason, what are you doing? Get in there. - My heart belongs to Rachel. They know this. - I gotta get back to work. Fuck you, guys. - Whatever, man. - I get a slice. - No. - Yeah, I get a slice. - No. - Well who's gonna eat it? - Not you. (bright music) - Yeah, I've been there for like two years now I think. It's not the worst job you can get. Probably better than most places. - Except for Mattan's perpetual panic attacks. - [Sierra] Ugh, right. Actually gives me anxiety. - [Crispin] No, they're a nightmare. - [Sierra] As nightmarish as you eating slower than lettuce grows? - [Crispin] Okay just 'cause I don't inhale my fucking food. - [Sierra] Okay. - [Crispin] No, did you hear that music? I can't eat when that shit's playing. - [Sierra] You don't like some good old death metal while you eat? Are you human? - [Crispin] There's a time and there's a place for everything I believe, but when I'm eating a nice meal, just don't want someone fucking yelling at me. - I guess I didn't really take you for a metal head anyway. More of a violent gangster rap kind of guy. - Is it that obvious? - I can see it in your eyes. - Okay, what type are you then? - Death metal. - That makes sense. - That makes sense? - Yeah, you know, you just look like you're a person that is hiding like four or five tattoos now. Right now. - Maybe I am. Do you have any? - Yeah, I have fucking this one, but I'm not happy with it and I don't think I could ever get one again. Actually, you know what? I think there is one power in this world strong enough to get me to get another tattoo. - What's that? - Pussy. - Yeah you know, it's like our eighth time hanging out. We're enjoying each other's company. Having some laughs and then bam. She can now scar my body forever. - Okay, so seven hangouts from now, we're getting a tattoo. Excellent. Where would you get it? - That's the worst part. I don't know why but I kinda like need it here. So no matter what I get, I'm like 95% sure it's just womanly. - A little bit, yeah. - Yeah. Plus, I'm pretty sure my dad would actually have a stroke and fall over. - Do you live with both your parents? - I don't actually. They got divorced when I was five I wanna say. - Yeah, mine got divorced when I was young, too. My mom cheated on my dad. - No shit. - My dad cheated on my mom so. - Do you have any siblings? - I do actually. I have a little sister. Well she's actually from a different dad. He died before she was born. Pretty sure my mom actually talked to him to death. (soft music) - [Sierra] You blaze, yeah? - Does the Pope shit in the woods? Yeah. It's a yeah. Yeah, I blaze. - Goddammit. Every time I take the first hit, all the shit I have to do comes rushing to the front. - It's only natural, but you just gotta smoke through that shit. Embrace the numbness. - Yeah. - No, I assume it's all school stuff. - Yup, of course. - Where you sentenced? - Fucking OCC. How 'bout you? - Fucking IVC. - How's that? - Oh, it's purgatory. You just sit there and burn off sins. - Like this whole place? - Yeah, like this whole place. But honestly the worst part, I'm really bad at school. Snapple facts. - No. You've not seen bad. I am the worst. I just would rather do anything else, you know. Like draw or read or write even. - That's the worst part. I'm not bad at school 'cause I'm like busy like reading or writing or doing something like painting or laying in a field even. I just fucking sit on a couch, look at some form of a glowing box. Be it a phone, computer, TV, whatever. And I just archive shitty ideas that I hear, so I can just fucking regurgitate them whenever I want. So I'm pretty sure I'm just a burnout that has yet to burnout. - That just sounds like an excuse to lay back and be a burnout. - It is. Like everything I say is an excuse. In fact, everything everyone says is an excuse. God, I just realized how douchey that sounds and how douchey the word douchey is. I'm so sorry. You could probably have the rest 'cause I'm done 'cause no thing good is coming from here. - You're fine. I don't do anything either. So, pretty soon we can get one step closer to getting you a tattoo. - [Crispin] You play your cards right. - [Sierra] I'm a lady. I'm always carefully picking my cards. - Well, I just killed a roly poly. That was a mistake. (bright music) Yo, Jason. Yeah no, I just got off right now. I'll meet you there. What do you mean you're already there? That doesn't even make any sense. You know how weird that is? No, that's cool, man. I can drive myself and meet you there. - Hey Crispin. Have you seen my hat? - Hold on, Jason. No, that ugly one that you always wear? No, not you, Jason. - So have you seen it? - No, I haven't seen it. - I really need to find it so I could... Fuck. - Are you okay, Lloyd? No, not you, Jason. You're never okay. Yeah no, I can drive myself. Don't worry. (upbeat music) - All right Crispin, where do you wanna live? - Fuck, I don't know, man. Anywhere. - Here's anywhere. - Well yeah, anywhere except here. - It's not that bad. Oh, cut the shit. How'd it go with Sara? - Sierra. - That well, huh? - It went all right. We didn't fuck or anything so I got nothing to report. - Dude, come on. I don't wanna hear about that stuff anyway. - All right, fine. We talked about nothing and it was fun. It was nice. It was pleasant. - Pleasant? - Fine, we talked about nothing and it was the best conversation I've ever had. - Oh shit. Sorry man, I thought I saw Rachel. - So you just read? - Yeah, she likes guys that read. - But you're sitting here with a person having a conversation. You don't you know. - Okay, yeah well now you're arguing logic with emotion. You can't do that, man. They don't mix. Come on. So, are you gonna see her again? - Yeah, she said she wanted to. - Whoa wait. She asked you to hang out? Oh Crispin, that's awesome. That's such good news, man. Or it means absolutely nothing. You know, I can't be sure unless I saw exactly how she said it. - Well she said soon. I don't know. - She touch your hands? - [Crispin] Yeah. - She stare at you when you talk? - Yeah. - There was a moment of comfortable silence, wasn't there? - There was. - [Jason] She make fun of how slow you eat? - She did actually. Fuck, you're good at this. - I know, I know. She make any future plans with you other than hanging out? Be it sarcastic or not? - Yeah, she mentioned a tattoo. - Oh, oh, Crispin. Congratulations, dude, you got it. You're money, man. Come on, now don't listen to what the other guys say or what Anthony says about her. You got yourself a strong bite. - I don't know, man. I really just don't think she likes me. What do you mean what Anthony and all them say about her? - Okay, Crispin, you gotta stop with this sad little man shit, okay. Come on, she touched your hand. Physical contact means physical interest. She stared you in the face when you were talking to her, right? So imagine you're out on this trail. There's all this beautiful scenery and she chooses you to look at. You know? And comfortable silence means she was actually listening to you, not just hearing you. Nobody listens nowadays. - You just make this shit up as you go or is it like it's stored in your head? - Come on, she was playfully making fun of you. What do you do when you play with someone? You have fun, right? She was having fun. And the tattoo thing means that she imagined a future with you. You know, it may have been incredibly short term, but she still imagined it. - I don't know, man. That's quite a bit of assumptions to make. - Dude, I know exactly what I'm talking about. Also, Anthony found this new place up on Yale. That's anywhere. - We can check it out, I guess but. Yeah also, I really don't think she could possibly like me. There's no chance in fucking hell, dude. You have a guest. - [Tiffany] Hey. - [Jason] Hey. Tiffany, no. Come on, you know where my heart belongs. Maybe you should go see what Anthony's doing. - Definitely gonna listen to you from now on. - Yeah right. - [Tiffany] Fuck you. - I don't know if I deserve that. (bright music) - [Johnny] The fuck you doing sitting around? - It's broken. - Oh. Sweet. In that case. Mattan finds out about this, you're fucking fired. - Why the hell can you do it? - 'Cause who's gonna fire me? - Mattan. - Which is why you're not gonna tell him. (bell chiming) Fuck. Hi fucking. Welcome to Northwood Pizza. Sorry about that, man. Having a bit of crazy night. - Nope. - Well it's good to see you find your hat at least. - It's your first job, yeah? - Is it yours? - Yup. Hopefully the last one. - What you wanna own this place? - Yeah. Yeah, and first order a business, no more fucking white people. - Like in general? Just. - Yeah, just all of 'em. No more fucking full grown men coming in ordering just a plain cheese pie. It's just fucking embarrassing to make, you know. You are late. - You are fired. - You can't fire me. - I get paid more. Hey, Crispin. - Thought that was like a joke thing at first, but I'm starting to get concerned. How much you get paid exactly? Don't answer that. No, answer it. - $9. - Shades. Fucking Crispin makes $9 here? What the fuck bullshit is that? - [Shades] Lloyd, watch your fucking mouth. I'm with a customer. You fucking idiot. That was two salads and. - You know you're never supposed to tell him how much you make? You've upset the order. - I figured that and I will comply with the consequences. - Noble, but your punishment will still be extreme. - Cut the shit. What happened with Lloyd's? - Hat? That has to do with Jordan. - [Crispin] Jordan? - Yeah, they were like inseparable in high school. They won state or something in football. Were going to the same college and got the same offers and they were family friends and the whole duo package. - So what, they get in a fight or something? - No. He died senior year. They were both in the car. So, the hat is Jordan's. - [Shades] What the fuck are you doing? - Fuck you, Shades. You owe me this. - Fuck are you? Tell you the truth, I don't even fucking care. (gentle music) - [Sierra] All right, anyone whose driven by and seen us in this cheesy ass setting. - Don't look at me. I don't control nature. Oh, I got one. My first driver license instructor. The guy that gave me the test. I don't know what to call him. - That bad? - I hit a deer, yeah. - What? What did you do like take your test in the woods? - No, that was the worst part. It was the first deer on record in that whole city. - Oh my god. - And I fucking killed it. - That's just that's not even your fault. You can't. - I don't know why you're laughing. It's not funny. - I'm sorry. Okay. My high school admissions counselor. - Mm, low SATs scores? - No, I killed the SAT, please. - Oh. Are we about to get real dark right now? Like some weird high school shit. Is that? - No, she just got me into a four year and I didn't go. - What do you mean didn't? Like on purpose? What do you mean? - I just I didn't. It wasn't my first or second or third choice school and just didn't go. - Well hey, at least know you could've got into one. I didn't even try. I didn't even fucking take the SAT. - Yeah. - Were you like were you scared or something? - Nothing. - Oh okay. - No, like literally nothing. What if I wasted all that time and just nothing happened? Just ended up back here with a piece of paper and a lifetime of debt. Like I just ended up switching between sitting in an office and sitting at a house and all I had was this house that I just tried to keep nice and empty while I scribble on some paper just wishing that I could be in that house. - Well I got bad news. You picked the wrong place to avoid doing nothing. - Yeah, scares the shit out of me. Like from here on life is just about sitting. We're just supposed to sit behind a desk so that we can afford to sit in our cars on our way to sit in a house where if we're lucky we can muster up the energy to grab some friends and sit in another building. - I mean, you can lay down. - You can lay down. - Plus honestly, if all there is to life is sitting, we're doing that right now and I'm cool with it, you know. - Yeah, I guess I don't really mind sitting with you. I don't know what it is about you, but I think you just understand more than most people in this town. - Oh god, no. I know nothing. I show up and I make a joke and I'm out. - No. You're not just a kind of funny guy to me. - It's 'cause you smoked the shitty weed. - Oh, take it back. Not funny. (gentle music) No, I really like spending time with you. - Now you're just coming off desperate. - Shut the fuck up. (soft music) (gentle music) (phone ringing) - Hello, Northwood Pizza.

You know, I'll do that for you. - I want you to do it. You know, Anthony, when you finally flunk out, you should be a professional wrestler. (bright music) - Are you gonna smoke that cigarette or you just gonna fuck it? (bright music) - I don't know.

Have you seen Sierra? - Dude, don't worry about Sierra. Man, you're good. Just trust me on this one. - [Crispin] What do you mean? What the fuck are you talking about? - Jason, go talk to that one over there. - Oh dude, why do I always have to talk to them first? - I'm a bottom feeder, dude. Come on, just be cool with it. I'm cool with it. Come on. - Dude, it's never worked before. Why the fuck would it work now? - [Anthony] Because it's overdue. - It's overdue. - Oh shit. There's Rachel. Sorry guys, gotta go. - That was fun. - Where Jason goes, I go. - Move, move, move. Here. - Oh my god, okay. You, this place is winding down. I'm thinking about bouncing out of this joint. Random girl X. - Natalia. - Natalia? No fucking way. Natalia. Is anyone there? I don't like being all alone in this big empty house. Just fucking just tell her to come here. - No. No. - All right fine, fuck. Here's what you do. You just say anything you want. She'll reply and the conversation won't end. And you'll do that a couple more times and then just slide in "Oh, I wish we could go to your house" and she'll invite you over. That's what you do. - Thanks. - Yeah. (bright music) - So like. Possibly afterwards we could do something. - Tim, Rachel, how you doing? - Good, how are you? - Good, good. Can I talk to you for a second? I know it's weird, sorry. But can he and I just? - Yeah, sure. - Real quick, what the fuck are you doing, dude? - It's Rachel. - Yeah exactly, it's Rachel. That's the whole Jason thing I was talking about earlier in the kitchen. - You know what? It's cool. Onto the next one. - Okay cool. (upbeat music) - Well check this out. Everything worked. Like it just worked. Gotta go. - Good for you, man. - Well he's got someone. That's good. - Hank, pull up your damn pants. What's up, buddy? - What is he talking about? Hi. I was wondering if I could give you a ride home or something. - Oh you know, I actually I came with Anthony and Crispin. All them. So I think I'm just gonna. - Okay well, you know I know they have a full car, so I mean you don't have to drive with them if you don't want to. - Yeah I think I'm okay for tonight. - Okay. - [Jason] Yeah. - All right. Have a good night. - Yeah, you too. It's good to see you. (upbeat music) (crowd chattering) (energetic music) - Yo, yo, yo, yo. Wait for Jason and then let's get the fuck out of here. Oh, as if on cue. - You guys are not gonna believe this shit. - Wait. You ready to go? - Yeah absolutely. Let's get the fuck out of here. - All right well then let's go. - But wait. You guys, I just straight up denied Rachel. - Wait what? - Shouldn't we get Adam before we go though? - No, no, fuck Adam. Fuck Adam? Fuck Adam. (upbeat music) - [Jason] Rachel. - Women. They always win. Come on. (upbeat music) I 110% did not leave my lights on. What the fuck? What the fuck happened to you? - Oh hey, boys. - Are you even at the same party we were just at? - Take me home. - [Anthony] Who the fuck are you? - Well I'm Adam. (gentle music) - So can we agree we just don't know who Adam is anymore? - [Crispin] No clue. - [Anthony] And that Jason was basically asking for that tonight. Nothing really happened for me. Fuck Chang's really the only one who came out on top tonight. - What the fuck, man? I don't get it. Do you get it? 'Cause I don't fucking get it. You know she originally wanted to hang out with me you know. Said she liked listening to me. Fucking asked to see me again. She even did that fucking thing where she touched my hand when she handed me a spoon like Jason was talking about. Fuck man, I just don't understand like what I did wrong. You know? I thought it was going fun. I thought we were having fun. - [Anthony] Well, did you make the move? - Nah I didn't make the move. You know, I didn't want to. Well I mean I wanted to but I just wanted it to be more than you know about just that. I wanted that to be clear. - Oh, you wanted it to be clear. Well, did you tell her how you feel? - Well no. Not directly but you know. She said she likes spending time with me and I said I agreed so I figured it was inferred. - So let me get this straight. You didn't make a move. You didn't tell her how you feel. You basically did nothing. What the fuck did you think was gonna happen? - [Crispin] I don't know, man. - Here's a question. What would you have done if you found Sierra alone at that party tonight? - [Crispin] I don't know. (soft music) - You know, I get it. I really do. It's a bummer, dude. It really is but you can't do nothing and expect something to happen. Yeah, she's cool. You know, I like her. Cool chick but. She's just another reason for you to stay. - Another reason for me to stay? - Yeah like you know we all have our things keeping us here. Like Jason will always love Rachel forever and I'll probably stay at junior college for the rest of my life. And Adam can't go anywhere he can't pass out at. - So, it's not like I have anything going on. - [Anthony] Yes, you do. Everyone knows it. You have these antsy legs, man. They just want you to get out there. It drives me crazy that you're still here but. So, you're always asking like when are we moving out? When are we doing this? Since when have you even cared? And you got this job out of nowhere. - [Crispin] So I got a fucking job. There's no difference between me and anyone else, man. - Yes, there is. There's such a difference. You aren't anything like me and you don't wanna be. I'll probably be here for years and years. For the rest of my life probably but I'm okay with it. You know? You can't look me in the eye and tell me that you'd be okay living here 10 years from now. And that right there is enough. - [Crispin] You know what the problem is? - What? - I'm just not a closer. - Well I'm not gonna kiss you goodnight. Get out of my fucking car. - [Crispin] All right. Easy. Later, dude. (gentle music) - Guys, we are fucked. Geez, we're fucked. - Mattan, dude, we're fine. You can go one day without meatballs. - Whoa, easy goes it. - I'm out, bitches. I got enough fucking signatures. All Star Donuts is coming back. Gotta get my ass to the meeting. - [Johnny] Mattan. Dude, you know what? Fucking leave, okay. You give me anxiety. Jesus. - All right, I'll see you all later. - You don't know that. - [Johnny] You don't know that, Sierra. - [Sierra] Yeah, yeah. - Hey. You good to close? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. (soft music) - I'm really fucking glad you're leaving, man. (soft music) - Okay. (soft music) - [Johnny] I'm out. (bright music) - You know even with you leaving, still gonna like this place. - Still got a little bit to get rid of me. - Yeah. It's honestly probably good that you're leaving because this place is better brainless. - Why do people keep handing me joints? - Yeah, yeah. You wouldn't know. You know. Jordan and I. We used to hang out here all the time. We had those. Those little club baseball meetings where everybody gets a trophy, even fucking Franklin Zhang who only played one game before he broke his nose from missing the ball. Oh. Hell, we both had our first vaginal experiences back behind the old spot. I mean, it was both of our first jobs. (gentle music) I like it here. (gentle music) You're gonna smoke that or fuck it? (gentle music) (bright music) - I'm telling you guys I don't see it as a defeat. It's more like a round two. - Yeah, against a whole different opponent. You lost entirely. - Yeah but my new opponent is myself. Don't you see, Anthony? Once I can defeat myself, then I can defeat Rachel. Besides, once we get that new place, man girls love that shit. Will be weird without you though, Crispin, but you can come over whenever you want. - Have you even tried with another girl? - Come over whenever I want? You moved closer to me. You moved into town. - I don't need another girl. We already talked about this. - Yeah and you have no excuse not to come over all the time, Crispin. - He knows that. He just doesn't want to pay rent. (bright music) Rachel wouldn't need to pay rent. - All right. I'm out of here. I got homework to avoid. You coming? - Yup. - What are you doing? - I honestly have no idea. - Figures. Peace. (bright music) - Wait a sec. (bright music) - Doesn't that burn? - Yup. But not as much as it does have to see your face everyday, but I don't have to anymore so life is good. You know what? I'ma take another one. Mm, that one actually does burn. Bye, babe. - Fuck. (bright music) - Look at that. Your last pizza. (bright music) I can't even look at that. That's too sad. Whoa, can't even look at you. It's too sad. It's too sad, Shades. Too sad. (bright music) (soft music) - Hey Crisp. - Hey Sierra. - Congratulations. - On what? - You're out of here. - Oh yeah. - I actually won 20 bucks from Shades because of you. - How? - He said you'd be here over a year and I told him there was no way. - What made you go under it? - Because I met you. I knew there was no way. - You mean I can't keep a job? - No. Well, yes. Not this one. (soft music) - Did you ever bet on yourself? - Of course. I always said that I would be here under a year, but I lost that a year ago. But I doubled down and this time Shades says I was gonna be here under a year. - What made you go above? - I've got more than a year left here. - Yeah right. Not if you don't help me restock this fridge. You have less than a day. - Okay. All right. (soft music) (dramatic music) (bell chiming) - Dude, have you seen Shades put food in his mouth? It's ridiculous. (dramatic music) (bell chiming) Wow. Okay, okay. Shades. (dramatic music) (bell chiming) Holy shit. - What? Goddammit. (dramatic music) (bell chiming) - [Shades] This kid? Seriously? - Guys, we working or are we working? - Shut up. (dramatic music) (bell chiming) - Whoa. (dramatic music) (bell chiming) - Garza. (dramatic music) (bell chiming) Shoot. - I know. (dramatic music) (bell chiming) Pinball wizard over here. Oh, that's okay. You got two left. (dramatic music) (bell chiming) - All right, Crispin, last day on the job, huh. (dramatic music) (bell chiming) - [Lloyd] Yes, yes, yes, yes. (dramatic music) (bell chiming) Nice. Halfway there, man. (dramatic music) (bell chiming) - [Anthony] It's time for our final pizza. - Last free pizza anyway. (dramatic music) (bell chiming) Damn, Crispin. Yeah. (dramatic music) (bell chiming) All right. (dramatic music) (bell chiming) - [Shades] It's okay, you got one more. One more, buddy. (dramatic music) Hit it. There you go, there you go. Hit it. - [Lloyd] All right. (dramatic music) (bell chiming) - Come on, come on, come on. (dramatic music) (bell chiming) - Yeah, Crispin. Nice. Woo. (dramatic music) (bell chiming) Yes. (dramatic music) (bell chiming) - [Anthony] Together, dude. (dramatic music) (bell chiming) - [Shades] Come on, come on, come on. (dramatic music) (bell chiming) - [All] Aw. - [Lloyd] God. - [All] Whoa. (dramatic music) (group chattering) (dramatic music) (bright music) (upbeat music)
