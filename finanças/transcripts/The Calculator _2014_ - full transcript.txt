A thousand years ago the first settlers left Earth. They organized a League of Free Worlds. Some got warm and sunny planets, but I was destined to be born on planet XT-59. Despite impenetrable swamps and dark clouds which cover the sky, the planet was considered liveable. People took a piece of land from the swamp and built a model city on it. We enjoyed order and prosperity. For the benefit of society the total control system provided isolation from the outside world, constant surveillance and strict requirements. In particular, for the benefit of society, the system chose a job for me that I hated, married me off to a man... who I hated even more than my job. I always dreamt of getting out of this world. And one day I got lucky. A batch of prisoners has arrived. Security cordon, guns at the ready. On our planet all achievements of civilization help to ensure that the citizens do not live the way they want to but live in the way the System prescribes. Those who do not fit into the System, like me, for example, must be destroyed. Hands on the wall! The recognition system employed. So, have you missed me? Are you still teasing, my dear? Yust Van Borg. Are we going to the swamps? Confirmed. Next. Anna Kristina Schulz. All personal data collected by the total control system go to the central computer managing the planet. Based on these data, the president tells his advisers... Yan Obermayer. Who should be arrested and for what. For every person, there is an article to convict them under. Matias Cassada. In my case, the article gave no options, so to speak. Listen to me carefully. Tomorrow your sentence will become effective. Thank our humane system for your still being alive. I would simply shoot you like infectious vermin. Beauty, did you hear that? We are infectious vermin... infectious. I don't doubt. We are giving you life. 300 kilometres due East. An oasis is waiting for you there. Islands of Happiness. This is your chance to redeem yourselves. According to the official version of the Ministry of Justice, it is possible to reach "a liveable area." But it is only in theory. It is really unknown if anybody reached the Islands of Happiness. The swamp is teeming with different creatures and they administer supreme justice, having freed people from it. You'll take 20 steps forward and wait for my command. I hope the cordon seine net is removed? Go, smart alec. One, two, three, four, five. I thought there was no capital punishment on our planet. Hey, on the tower! Why haven't you removed the cordon?! Some movement has been spotted in the swamp, Mister Captain. Remove it immediately! In the name of the government and the people! You are sentenced to life in exile. The sentence shall become effective in this minute. Calculator This box is yours. Although I think there's no point in spending on you. But the law requires that exiles have the necessary minimum of food and equipment. You should leave within an hour. Anyone who stays on the shore after the siren sounds will be destroyed. I don't wish you luck. I... have been sentenced to exile.. I'm a tourist. I... I should go to the spaceport from here. Wait. Get up, it's OK. Calm down, calm down. Well, I suggest we get acquainted first. I'm Ervin. Ervin Kann. I'm Yust. Polar Wolf! Have you heard of me? Don't you idiots know who the Polar Wolf is? Do you at least understand how lucky you are? He's served time already. He knows these swamps like the palm of his hand! I want to know everything about each of you... and why he is here. We'll begin... with you! I'm Valentin Holmer. Accused of espionage for the Earth and the League of Free Worlds. Got it... Simply put, a traitor. What about you? Dzhob Riceman. A banker. You'll be the first to die. It's a saw-wort. What? That's what this creature is called. It senses vibration and attacks. Stop talking. I ordered you all to introduce yourselves. First, not you, but him. And he suggested, not ordered. My name is Anna Kristina. So you'll be Kristi. That's shorter. I shall decide everything here. Should I help you understand it? Of course you should. But not now. It's time to take the equipment. Get away from me! Let me. Give... Give it to me... to me, I said! Drop it... you won't need it. Yust. The swamp will eat you. If you want to survive, stay close to me. Or maybe someone wants to go away? I want to go away. Yes, me too. I won't stay here either. And where will you go? To the Islands of Happiness. Oh, the Islands of Happiness. Do you like children's fairy tales? Well, if it's your decision, get out of here, please. But I want to get my share first. Take it. Oh, and this is my share. Yust, are you sure you don't want to share voluntarily? I don't. But in any case you don't have any choice... I'll kill him and all of us will be shot, since settlings of accounts between prisoners are qualified as an attempt to obstruct justice. You're not an idiot to die at the very beginning, right? So you want to die first? OK, the group can survive but everyone individually has no chance. There are two of us - me and Kristi. We are a group. And we want to take a risk. It's so stupid to give you anything. To waste supplies on dead people. OK, don't move. Take them. Pick them up. The swamp creatures will feast easily. Two backpacks, poles and our share of the rope. Don't be a fool, you know the rules. You have a good friend. Now get out of here. Of course, Yust. You see, I need something else. What? This box. Well, when it is empty. What do you need it for? When I get tired, I'll fill it with water and take a bath. I'll sell it. I'm giving you three ones. No. Give me all six! What will we eat? Give him all of them. Now get out of here! And you pick them up. OK. Work, lazy bastard! Maybe you'll help the woman? This woman is already dead. With a pole or without it, she won't reach even the Rotten Shoal. And she'll be the first whom Yust will sacrifice instead of himself. And you can talk about it so calmly? I won't go anywhere without her. You and Mariya will go together then. Believe me, I feel sorry for her, but I can't help her. Honestly, I'd like Yust to be the one responsible for her death, not me. Why did you choose me? Aren't you the one who chose me? But you need me too. Yes. You'll go ahead of me. Wow. And if I refuse, I'll go alone, right? No! I'll go first then and sink into the mud more often. And you'll pull me out. The light one should go first, the strong one should follow. It's logical. You have calculated everything, right? Get up, rat! Come on. Quick. Prisoners, leave the perimeter or you will be destroyed. Prisoners, leave the perimeter or you will be destroyed. Prisoners, leave the perimeter or you will be destroyed. We'd better leave now or they'll shoot us. Come on. Go! Women are strange beings. It is clear I've no chance of reaching the Islands of Happiness. But a man appears who says there is a chance and I'm already doing what he tells me to do and will go first. He's calculated everything. Some calculator he is. Don't let me see you again. Go. Ervin. Ervin. Wait. What do you want? Stop! Can I go with you? I won't be a drag on you, I promise. Stop! Where is your friend? Matias? Yes. There is a small hole in the granite, just for one person to go through. He decided to stay and I chose to go! Can I go with you? I've equipment and a food supply for 2 persons. Stop! I've a friend already. Go back. Just look at her! I'm strong, beautiful. And I can do something... So? So, shall we take her? You wanted to help the woman. And this one can do something! I won't go with you anywhere. Are you OK? Yes. Shit. Not good! It means they tried to shoot me. You're bringing bad luck to me. Go back to the Wolf. You'll be sorry! Do we have a long way to crawl? I don't know. At last you've admitted you don't know something. You seemed to be a know-it all. What do you mean? What do I mean? Yes. Your admission means you're not hopeless. It's a compliment, by the way. I got it. I'm moved. Are these things dangerous? No. Only if you eat too many of them. They contain weak toxins. I will never eat them. We'll see what you say tomorrow. Stop. Where are you going? I want to see something. What if they begin to shoot again? They won't. We are on the magnetic ridge already, ray guns don't work here. They are following our trail. They are seven, which means she told the truth. Her guy stayed on the shore. Either he is a stubborn idiot or... He's an idiot. OK! One idiot less. Did they kill Matias? They did. OK. What if he is an executioner? Killer? Maybe he's a doctor? Where does his self-confidence come from? Where did you come from? We'll die sooner or later and he has no emotions. Maniac. Ervin, what if there are no Islands of Happiness? What if they are a legend? They are not a legend. They do exist. And today I understood that it's possible to reach them. Did you see they hadn't removed the cordon and told me to go first? I did. It means they wanted to kill me for sure. What's the point in killing a person if he has no chance? It's not logical. Are you a big shot? I mean were you a big shot? OK, don't tell me if you don't want to. It's not important who you were there. The main thing is that you've already visited the swamp. This is the first time I have been here. Just like you! Are you kidding? You still can change your decision. Go to the Wolf. As who? A concubine? To lie under him in the mud every day? Maybe I should do everything he tells me? If you come with me, you'll have to do whatever I say too. Why? Well, just because I know the Sargasso Swamp better than you. But you just said you had never visited the swamp! To visit and to know are different things. Is he still alive? But you asked to act delicately... Captain, are you an idiot?! I just asked not to tear off his head in the presence of everybody. You could have pushed him to the seine net... delicately. As simple as that. What about you, good shooter? I'm sorry, Mr. President! I couldn't kill him before he reached the magnetic range and it was dangerous to go further. Moreover, a light ray gun isn't effective there already. Not effective? Yes, Sir! Excuse me, Mr. President, but there is no need to worry. The swamp will eat him. No doubt about that. And, in case of emergency, there is another option. And still I've had no luck with men. Yust is stronger, more reliable and he could have liked me. From the point of view of the System, I made a wrong choice. But how can I explain to the System I feel calmer with Ervin. The System can't understand that. Don't move. Are you peeping at me? Freeze, I said, freeze. A knife. What? Find a knife. Yes. Cut. Cut at the bottom, cut at the bottom. Look, we were very lucky. And you were great too. What's this? A whipping withe. From the word 'whip.' It will be our weapon now. If it had whipped you hard, you would have nothing to wash. Give me the knife! Deep? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Have you killed anybody before? I have. Your lover. You're pretty. That's logical! He didn't manage to become my lover. He was a municipal inspector. I came to him to get a divorce permit and he began to molest me. Did you get it? A permit? He got it. I hit his head with an ashtray. It is a good thing I don't smoke... And Yust probably does. Have I told you I don't want to see you in the swamp? Of course, Yust, if you stop following hard on my heels. The Polar Wolf goes where he wants. I'm going to take this box. No, Yust, you sold it. Really? Khayme, take it. Of course. OK, let's make a halt. You're a dead man already, bastard. Shit, look, they're following us. Following our trail again. Where is he going, this Polar Wolf? To his place. The Rotten Shoal. What's there? A former prison. Social outcasts, sectarians, murderers like you. Yust is in charge there. Let's go. So he really knows the road well. As you can see, there is no road here. That's why he needs victims to go on ahead of him. We should have taken Leila with us. We could have saved her at least. Crowding the swamp is like feeding saw-worts. Go. Stop. What? Let's make a halt. But we've been walking only for a very short time. Just lie, close your eyes and count silently. What number Shhh. Should I count to? Move it. Go. What the hell? What's this? What shall we do? Nobody should touch these stems! Everybody freeze! This... Be quiet, be quiet! Stay where you are! Don't move! Shit! Lie down! Stop! Cut the rope, Dzhob! With the knife. Everybody lie down. Be quiet. Where are you going? Stop, you fool! I said stop! Help! Calm down, calm down... calm down. You knew that! You knew! And you didn't warn them! I didn't do that. The swamp did. You understand? You should know they drew the attention of a saw-wort that could have eaten you. Do you want to survive? Look at me when I'm talking to you! Do you want to survive? Yes or no? I do. Listen to me. Get up and go. Quick! Somebody was very smart! Simply to send a prisoner out to the swamp. Capital punishment is so bothersome. An executioner who can't sleep at night, blood. And it's necessary to get rid of a corpse. And here Nature can do everything. Is the problem solved? Unfortunately, not yet, Mr. President. Very good. Excuse me, I don't understand you. You never understand anything. You should urgently find the adviser and bring him here. Safe and sound. But he is in the swamp, Mr. President! So go to the swamp and bring him here or else you'll be in the next batch of prisoners. But it appears that our woman continues to follow the victim, which means that both of them are alive for now. For now, that's the point. Have you calculated all this? Right, at the very beginning. That's impossible. Why? It's possible to calculate practically everything. Calculator... I'm a mathematician. Although I haven't received a degree. My father taught me everything. Ervin, tell me who you were when you were free. If you do a problem, I'll tell you. Well, the three-body problem? Stellar dynamics. You don't know. I see. Something simpler then. A girl was dreaming about a bar of chocolate, just like you are now. But she was short of 10 coins to buy it. A boy was dreaming about the same thing, but he was short of just one coin. Then they decided to buy one bar of chocolate at halves, but they were short of one coin anyway. So, how much was a bar of chocolate? Wait! Where? Back. In the box. Calm down. How long should we lie here? I don't know. My body went numb. I can't. Calm down, calm down. Wait. Remove your hand from my chest at least. OK, let's climb out of here. We were lucky, right? How much was the bar of chocolate? What bar of chocolate? From that problem. Ten coins. The girl had no money at all. Let's get out of here. Take the pole horizontally. If you sink into, it'll be easier for me to pull you out. Let's go. You can't stay alive even for two days without electricity and warm water! They will eat you on Easter. Oh, they even observe the fast. OK, let's take a rest here. Don't, Yust. Tell them to go forward. Have you forgotten who you're talking to? I said to stay here. But they'll go away, Yust. I don't care if they go or not. We'll stay here for 3 hours. Stay here if you want. Hey, come back. I'll kill you when I catch you. You bitch! Come back, you won. Help me. - The Polar Wolf himself is in trouble now! - Help! Help! Look at this hero. Help, help. A famous criminal! You'll die here, scumbag! You'll pay for this! We can't do without him. We should pull him out. You shouldn't help anybody, Dzhob! I'm going there, he's there. He's a former adviser to the President. He knows where to go. He does know. And I'm going to him. Will we leave him? Do you want to be next to him? Come back, wait! Stop. Our Lord is testing us! Old man, God is testing him, not us. Bastards. Enough. Follow me! God, direct my hand! Save me. Give me strength. I'm begging you, help me, I'm begging you, save me. Who?! Who preaches God's Word in the Rotten Shoal?! You, you preach, only you. Take it. What? Eat. Eat them raw? Boiled ones are much worse. No, I won't eat them, it's better to die from hunger. Or else I'll have to use force. Eat. Imagine something good. A bar of chocolate, for example. Come on, go ahead. Chew, chew, chew! It's OK, don't spit out! Chew! You swallowed. Now I know why you were imprisoned, sadist. Well, maybe you tell me? What were you imprisoned for? You were the brains of a gang, right? Almost. I was an adviser to the President of this planet. You? Yes... Don't I look like the one? No, at all. I haven't heard anything of you, Ervin Kann. They don't usually show advisers on TV. But how did they catch you, if you were so smart? They didn't catch me. I surrendered myself. Why? Conscience. People are sent out to the swamp because of their conscience, right? Who occupy the same position as I did, yes. I can't eat this. Formally, I disclosed a state secret. I collected a lot of information and wanted to leak it or give an interview. About myself and the system I worked in. Why didn't they shoot you at once? They understood they couldn't take me out secretly. That's all. They sent me out to the swamp together with other prisoners in an eternal exile. Honestly, for me it's a chance to survive. Take it. Only be careful, blow first. Do you see that everything is in vain? You'll die in the swamp and they'll have everything the way it was before Not exactly the same way. Do you know what the trick is? I calculated and removed the component without which the System can't function. What component? This component is me. A microvirus, a small computer worm is spreading through their System and soon will cut the authorities off from the management of the planet. Of course they'll need the code. And only I know it. Great? I don't understand. Are you crazy or genius? You'll have a chance to check it soon. OK, but what's next? It's simple. Free people will have a chance to build their new system that probably will be better than the previous one. Or maybe it won't. But what if you fail? Do you know that in a million of cases the system wins? But always there'll be at least one human who beats the System. Look, but if they understand everything soon, they'll need the code, right? They'll be looking for you. That's logical. But I've calculated everything. By that time, I'll be in the Islands of Happiness already. We will. If you want to know, tadpoles are disgusting to eat. In the last hours of life you can choose not to torment yourself. But it is surprising somewhere deep in my soul there is a forgotten feeling of hope. It gives me strength to struggle and go. To go away from the city and with each step to get out of the web of the System. Now it's us or the System. Communication satellites failed. Communication satellites failed. Switching to redundant channels... blocking... Password recovery impossible... System recommends to delete and update initial data... Should I report it or not? I feel you can lose your head. Data transmission impossible through... Blocking impossible... blocking... That's him, it's adviser Ervin! Follow me! Adviser Ervin, adviser Ervin. That's not them! Let's get out of here! It's Mariya. Wait! Wait! Kristi, wait. They are the real bastards! Exile is the capital punishment! Go to the Islands of Happiness, you'll just die in this swamp! Who could have come up with such an idea? Me. I proposed this method of punishment. You? Yes. I thought culprits could expiate their guilt like that. And that it was humane. You're a scumbag like them! OK, maybe. But when my idea was turned into law none of the citizens objected, nobody. Not even you! You mean it's my fault that you send people to die slowly and painfully? And then you are proud of your humane methods. And live as if nothing happened. As you can see, I punished myself. I'm here. Of course your conscience has woken up. You fled here like a coward to save your skin! I wish the cordon seine net had burned you, then nobody would have never known your code. Yes, that's logical. Hey! I'm here! Come on, creatures! Come on! Ervin! What are you doing?! I'm trying to kill myself, don't you see? Hey! Ervin, why are you doing this? Come on! Fresh meat! Come on! Come on! Quick! Come on, go ahead! Even now you're thinking only about yourself! Where are you, creatures? You want me to die in this swamp too! What crap I am, if even creatures don't eat me. OK, I'll take you there. Let's go! Do you know that back in the prison the Captain woke me up and offered me freedom for your death. And I refused. Do you regret now? Here you are. Are you OK there? Get up, you bitch! You wanted to run from the Polar Wolf? Don't, Yust, please! Don't, Yust. I'll tell you everything. I'll tell you everything. I had to go, Yust, I had to go, understand? You think I've come to talk to you? Yust, I'll tell you everything. Please believe me. It's Ervin, adviser to the President, I must kill him, kill him, understand? In the prison they promised me freedom for this. Freedom, Yust, believe me. She's telling the truth. What? Ervin Kann is really an adviser to the President. You're stupid! You think they'll fly for you? Like hell they will? They just tricked you! The Rotten Shoal. Oh, you, spy, know something. Come on, tell me. The Rotten Shoal. There is a place where they can land a craft. But how will they know that she's there? A tracking device. There is probably a tracking device on her. Find it! - Dzhob, give me the backpack! There is a compass there, it'll respond. - No. Shut up! Be silent! Where is it? Got it. It's here, in her ankle. - No. - Come on. It should be cut out. Damn! Give me the knife. The knife. No. Stop. Stop! Sargasso. Unpleasant sight. We've no luck with women. Let's trade the adviser for my freedom. Let's go. Finally, we got lucky I think! Some swamp creature probably is digesting our woman. Matias! My god! Good! Damn ray guns don't work outside the perimeter and this is a real work of art! Captain, why didn't you tell me about this treasure before? I wanted to do everything myself. And to become a Colonel? OK, take a weapon. And one more thing. Take it. Loaded with soporific charges. For the adviser. Now they need him alive. Captain, it's a pleasure to deal with you. Have fun. The System will work for three hours more. We'll be oriented by your magnetic tracking devices. Got it. I found. He's already dead. What's with you? He's a dead man already. Let's go. Ervin. Wait. I got away from that criminal! Ervin. Don't stop. Why? Because I don't believe him. It's a trap. - You're paranoid, maybe he just wants to talk. - Wait for me! I'm going to you. Stop. Wait, Kristi! Wolf, what's next? Over there is an entrance to the Rotten Shoal. But we won't go there. There may be an ambush. We'll trick them. How are you? OK. Be careful. Don't provoke the wrath of God. Or else I'll have to hit you! Old man, be silent! There's no place to hide here. And if he tries, I'll kill the girl. They'll kill you, right? Not immediately. They need the code. And I've "forgotten" it. And there is nothing that can be done? You haven't calculated it? Yust won't give me them immediately. He'll bargain with them long, you have time. You can walk through the Rotten Shoal. Go to where there was an explosion, they won't look for you there and then... I won't go without you. You will. You've been through many things. You can do it without me, you don't need me anymore. It's not logical to stop. Go to hell with your logic, Calculator. If you haven't understand anything yet. Come on, get up! Yust, they'll trick you. They won't. They need me alive and they'll simply kill you. I know that Matias is going to trade the adviser for freedom. The adviser who's alive, fool. She didn't finish, a saw-wort distracted her. Get up. No, I won't go anywhere. Get up. My head is aching. Don't you see? Ouch! And you don't have a pill. I'll cut it off then. Go ahead. And then you'll lose yours because of that. Yust, you'll have to carry me. By the way, I've never ridden a wolf. I'm such an egoist. Yust is carrying the hope for salvation of millions of people and I'm thinking that nobody has carried me in his arms in all my short life. I don't know if he has reached the Rotten Shoal but he has no other way. We might have to wait for him for a while. Are you ready? With your arsenal I'm ready for everything. Let's begin the hunt, Captain. Be silent. Don't be scared. Be silent I said. Has anybody new come from the swamp? You're lying. Now you can be scared. Only don't lie! Nobody new has reached here. I'm not lying. These rats are going. Let's bury them here. Go upstairs to the central exit. If you see anybody, let me know. Go! Stop! Hands up! What the...? Welcome to the Rotten Shoal, adviser. Haven't you changed your mind? I haven't. They'll kill you in any case. I know them, Yust. We'll see about that. Sit here. Matias. Where are you? Matias. Stop! Oh, look who's here. I can't believe my eyes. Stop! Bring the adviser here. I've come to exchange him for freedom. You'll get it. Anything you want, Yust. What are my guarantees? You want guarantees? Yep. Be careful. OK. Take me to him. Let's go. He is there, inside. Are you kidding? Do I look as if I'm laughing? He really was here. We'll find him. Go! Oops. Empty, right? What about mine? I'm having a great time here! Move out, rats, quick! Let me go! I had an omen. God has told me that my flock is here. Understand? I do! I'll even help you meet Him, Father! Come out, adviser! I'll find you anyway. Do me a favour. On your knees! Adviser. Adviser. Dzhob. Can I help you? I'll count to three, adviser. Hold the gun on me and when I raise my hands, One. You shoot at me. No, no, I can't. You wanted to help me. Two. Three. Well, it's your choice, adviser. You wanted to change the lives of millions. Then save at least one! Let her go! Or you won't be able to get me alive! Get up. Get up. OK, adviser. I agree. Only no tricks. Go. Have you come up with something? Of course. Dzhob will get you out. Good night, adviser! What? Kristi. You OK? OK. It's a soporific. Thank you. You must be an important person, if they are hunting you so doggedly. I warned you. Don't go to the Islands of Happiness. You'll die. It's the only chance for us. Is she OK? Yes. Please give me that. Capsule? Yes. I'm holding it. I've traded you for freedom. No, Ervin, no, we'll never reach that shore. We'll die here from thirst and hunger. Or the soldiers will find us and kill. Oh, shit! It's not an island. That island is not an island! Don't you notice anything? It's moving! What? Which means these islands are just pieces of the swamp carpet. And they float. Look, it's an excellent island! Do you want to float on this island? Yes! And it will bear us! Three of us! The wind will do the rest. You're crazy! No, I'm a genius. Kristi! If these islands do move, the wind moves them back and forth. It blows from the mainland or toward the mainland. It will blow us back. It's OK. An anchor will slow down the backward drift. We'll increase the windage. And the wind will help us. And we'll certainly win. I hope you have him, Captain. Not yet. No contact with Matias. But you haven't done the task. I'll send another craft for the adviser. Every minute counts. A chain reaction began. Everything is The System is being turned off. We are late. Prepare for departure, Lieutenant. Covering our tracks. The management system is blocked. The adviser is behind the Rotten Shoal. Find him and destroy. If he comes back, he won't spare me and you. Feeling dizzy? You better sit down. Good. We'll float for a week from here. I think less. If there is no storm from the ocean that can throw us back. Ervin, this island will sink without any storm. Only don't tell Dzhob about that. Dzhob! Dzhob, hang in there. I'll pull you out. It's useless, adviser. Take it. Don't. Take it. Dzhob. This island won't bear three. Grab the rope! Don't, Ervin. Shit. It's short. I've already reached my Islands of Happiness! You hear that? What? Wind, wind, wind, Ervin. I don't hear. Target Direction System activated. Engines cutting off! Enter the code! Enter the code! So my code worked. Code? My code, it wor... Ervin, Ervin, you did it! You did it! You understand you did it? So my code worked? You've beaten the system! My code worked, right? Ervin, you are a genius!!! My code worked. - Ervin Kann... you're a genius!!! - My code worked! I haven't taken that into account. What's this? It's a waterfall. What shall we do? What if we wrap ourselves in the carpet of seaweeds? Right. Unroll it there... Look, when we are falling, take a deep breath and hold it as long as you can. Understand? Now listen to a prayer: Any object immersed in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by... I got it, I got it. Come on, pull! If Archimedes was wrong, I'll find him... find him there... Come on, pull! It was so stupid to expect something good from the Islands of Happiness on the most unhappy planet in the galaxy. What fool called these islands the Islands of Happiness? A fraud. No! No! Don't you see it's not logical. Dull. What? Ervin! Here is a secret military facility according to the map. A bunker. Where there is a personal craft of the president in case of an evacuation. It's autonomous. This is an entrance. We only need to enter the code. Do you know it? Of course. I programmed it together with the President. So? What? He entered the last digit. I don't know it. Let's enter each digit one by one. Great, let's do it. We have only two attempts. Maybe it's his birthdate? Some important date? Here are all important dates in his life, you know. All these digits that could occurred to him before he entered this code. What happened before that moment? Why are you asking a stupid question? Ervin, please! Well, before that moment... Before that moment... As he had to stay alone to enter that digit. I walked out. That's all. Did he say anything to you before you walked out? Yes, he gave me a bar of chocolate and said it was good for my brain. OK, what about you? What about me? What about you? And in reply I gave him a riddle, the same one as I gave to you. About a bar of chocolate for ten coins. Maybe it is ten? It's two digits, Kristi. One and zero. Did he solve the riddle? No. He thought for a long time and then said, nine coins. Did you tell him it was a wrong answer? Of course not. He is the President. Ervin, it means he was sure the bar of chocolate cost nine coins. He thought it was the right answer. Enter nine. Don't you think it's a total bullshit? It's not logical. Do you have any other options? System activated. Enter code. Three. Five. Eight. Eight. Ervin! Be quiet. Why did you do that? Code unidentified. One attempt left. I just checked how this system works. Enter code. Three, five, eight. Nine Nine. Code identified. Welcome, Mr. President. Come on, get in. Press the red button to start. Everything is simple. What about you? I'll wave a farewell. That's funny. No, I'm not kidding. Really. Ervin. It's single-seated. What's wrong? Don't worry about me. I'll come up with something. Do it now. Come up with something so that we can fly together. You're the Calculator. I don't calculate what can't be calculated. Go. Come on, go!!! Then I'll stay with you. Why? Because I love you. Why did you enter the wrong code first? I checked. You're lying. You knew the craft was single-seated and simply didn't want to open. Don't squirm. I can't. My nose is resting against your boots that smell swamp. I pressed some button. It's acceleration lever. Cover your ears tightly. How? I won't reach them. Then I'll cover them with my feet. No! Thanks to our salvation the League of Free Worlds learned the truth about our planet. The peacekeeping forces rid the inhabitants of the remnants of the Total Control System. In ten years a new system established itself on planet XT-59, much more cruel than the previous one.
