*silent scene* Don't drop the flag when attacking! * Persons and their colors: * Jack, called "Harmonica" Hard rock, Cheyenne warrior fawn, his sister (yells) Hey! * Fanfare signal * Here! Come here everyone! Nothing will happen to you under the flag of the white men. stay together you are safe here * Shots ring out. * * screams * Los, he, he, he! * Gunshots and battle cries * *melody on harmonica* To hell! Stop playing! Three fools like you have been hanged since I joined this regiment. Why are you here? They say I sold army guns and saddles. Test of the es? * No Answer * Are you okay, fat? Why did you throw down the flag today of all days? That was probably a bit much today. A little bit? Murder women and children! That was the first time for you. Forget it! I'm sorry. Big Fred and I don't like to play heroes for others either. We're leaving tonight. There's a lot of gold in Montana. That's definitely enough for us. You don't have to come with me. But don't hope they don't hang you tomorrow. (yells) Alarm! The red hats! * Shots ring out. * They get their horses back. This is very good for us. Come on, Tall One! (Narrator) President Lincoln invited Chief Black Cauldron in 1864. He was presented with a Stars and Stripes during the negotiations. "No soldier may attack while the flag is flying over the tipis." That was the promise. The Cheyenne Indians went to Colorado, to the banks of Sand Creek. They trusted Lincoln's words and posted no guards. Some survived the bloodbath. They went north. Today there is the state of Wyoming. The army followed them constantly. New goldfields were discovered in Montana. The United States again broke the treaties. They built the Bozeman Trail: a connecting road to the north. Fort they should make sure. It led across Indian territory with the last herds of buffalo. *melody on harmonica* (Fred) Damn it, harmonica! Can't play anything else? I can, but my horse loves hearing this song. It's always in a good mood. Your horse likes you because you're skinny, it doesn't have to be wearing Big Fred. Sure, my horse has to do a lot of hauling when we escape from the Indians. Big Fred, why don't we ask the Cheyenne where the gold is? Gold doesn't interest these hollow heads. Why do we give them this whole beautiful country? I believe there is no Cheyenne and no gold here. From the Bastard book! Worth it! Come here, you carrion! You're about to experience something! Stop it, Fred! What shoud that? Fred! Leave the horse alone! Throw away the stick! I know you talk nice and play him something. As long as we ride together, you treat the horse well. Leave me alone with your... Stop it or you'll get the name "Splashing Frog". *silent scene* It's lovely here. We build a little shack and live well until we die. You probably don't feel like searching for gold anymore. What a pity about the beautiful summer. I'm right? Do you think the same as me? Our conversations are always very one-sided. * Schï¿½sse * Damned! That means trouble. Are you crazy? Do you have to shoot right away, you idiot? Bring a rope, quick! Damn beast! are you crazy What do you think of? Let go of the girl, Fred! He shot the old woman and the boy. (Fred) They set the tribe on us! let her go Why are you doing this? A dead Indian is the best Indian. The Redskins must be chasing us now, you moron! Come on, harmonica, get out of here quickly! * Scream * I'm sorry for that. I've never hit a woman. i want to save you Anyway, I'm trying. Did you know Indian girls are so beautiful? *rhythmic music, drums* * shouts, babble of voices * We killed a white man and caught him. The third escaped. We will judge you, white man. Let him die in front of our tribe! No, gray moose. This man didn't shoot your wife and child. He saved my life. We have to consider what your sister says. This is important for his life. Today he saves her. Tomorrow he will kill her. When will we finally understand that the white man is not honest? My son and my wife lost their lives at the fault of the white people. Tomorrow another of us will mourn his wife and son. How many white men can you kill? I visited their President. I saw how many there are. The President promised that no white man would attack our country. But they plunder our hunting grounds and kill our families. The prisoner shall not die like a murderer. you caught him You have the right to fight him. Head to head. Why? I didn't kill anyone. I saved a life! Don't you understand? I have spoken! You decide your life in the death race when the sun rises. * excited babble of voices * * sad music * What is that? moccasins. you need her I bring food too. I'd rather have a knife. I don't want a death race. I have no desire to kill your brother. Why does he want to kill me? I'm not hungry. Did my sister bring food to the white man? Yes. I was about to send you to him. I don't want to defeat a man who was powerless with hunger. You follow the white man when he reaches the top of the hill. You make your own decisions about your life. Run, white man! * battle cry * *fast music* * battle cry * *fast music* Not so fast. Drink slowly! How is your brother? Experienced. I don't know if that's good for him though. Is it better to be dead? You gave him his life. This is a severe punishment for him. He'd rather be dead. I do not understand that. What is happening to me now? Let me kill the white man or kill me! Your fight is decided. You both shall live. The white man is free. He decides his own way. you could kill me Why didn't you? I've never killed a defenseless man. You didn't take my life Is it worth so little? This is nonsense. Nothing is worth more than life. Why should I take it from you? i think you are honest But I don't understand your words. Why shouldn't your life be worth anything to me? We fought each other and we survived. We should be friends. A red man takes no gifts from his enemy. Can I try it? * Children laugh. * What can the white man do without powder and lead? * Shot * I think someone is making fun of us both. Alright. We'll show her what we can do. With a saddle. What can the white man do without a saddle? He certainly never attempted to lasso a bull without a saddle. Na them! Hey! * Harmonica plays his song. * Did I scared you? I do not think so. why are you watching me It's fun. Especially when I fall off my horse. What's your name? I'm Jack. My friends call me harmonica. Sit up! i'm taking you home It's too lonely for little girls here. Harmonica... Strange name. Why strange? What's your name? Rehkitz. "Big eyes" is more appropriate because you're always looking at me. But "roe fawn" sounds nicer. Do white men always ride in circles? No, just with a pretty girl. That makes the way longer. Ah, that's why. Then play your strange instrument for me! That makes the way shorter for me. If you like. * Harmonica plays his song. * did you like it One can get used to it. What was that? I think a bear is near. Better hold on tight! are you staying with us I don't know yet. Will you show me Hard Rock? Keep the bow straight. Die Finger so. Aim calmly. Let fly! I think I'm making progress. A wild animal does not stand still like a tree. I'm sure you're better with your weapons. Very impressive. But I wonder about many actions of the white man: What is that good for? Maybe I recognize it. show it again Come on, Big Fellow! Let's be friends! Making friends takes a long time. I know * Fawn whistles. * Oh you did that Show it to me? No wrong. Good. You're almost an Indian. Someday you will dance our war dance. * Mimics battle cry and Native American chant. * That doesn't look like a Cheyenne war dance. No, that's Chief Harmonica's love dance. Want to learn a white man's dance? Maybe this one: # A cowboy loves his girl all weekend. # He rides through the night and the prairie. # They were miles apart for a long time. # That's why he kisses her until Monday morning. # Stars reflected in her eyes. # And in the morning the sun rises in it. From ... I ... Forget it! What did you want to tell me? That wasn't important. But you wanted to say something. What was it? No nothing. I've forgotten it. how can you forget that Maybe I can help you. Is it about food? no Maybe you wanted to tell me something about the weather. Why about the weather? Did you want to tell me something about your mother and your brothers? I have no brothers. I already told you about my mother. I know. Maybe you wanted to tell me that you love me. That tickles. Rehkitz ... How do I say this? I've never asked a woman to marry me. You haven't asked any yet. But what does that have to do with me? Very much. you know it I want to marry you. i want to live with you I want a child from you. I say yes. And and. * Harmonica plays his song. * May I come in? The weather is getting colder. The autumn storms are coming soon. Do you want to tell me something? I want to stay with you. I want to marry your sister. Then what do you do next time your white brothers attack? We must live in peace with the white people. If I invade your country, kill your family: Do you then have the right to kill me? Wrong twice is wrong. Maybe nothing will get better if I avenge my dead brother. But no man can live without self-respect. Otherwise he can no longer see his face in the clear water of the mountain lake. I kill everyone who comes into my house and kills my family. That's good and fair. That's not reasonable. Your chief asked, "How many white people can you kill?" You kill 10 of you with each white at the same time. But you shall live! Maybe fate chose us to die? It kills the strong first and then the weak. Our only choice is: how do we want to die? That will also be your decision if you stay with us. I stay with you I marry fawn. If you leave her or take her to the white ones, it will break her heart I never leave her I never leave you We're preparing for the wedding. A Cheyenne wedding is very solemn. Friends of the groom bring gifts to the bride's father. That is, to me, because fawn no longer has a father. I have no friends and I own nothing. my friends help you Clothing, blankets, weapons and horses are given as gifts. A good horse is a good gift. The suitor is only welcome if the gifts are accepted. (laughs) I already have your commitment. You cannot refuse your own gifts. I'll tell you what custom is. The gifts are for the relatives. Then what happens? Girlfriends paint the bride's face for the wedding party. They clothe her in a new, beautifully embroidered garment. They then lead the bride into the groom's teepee. a teepee? I wanted to ask you ... We help build. That's the custom too. But you have to decorate it yourself. So paint, but how? That's your thing. What's next? You send your best horse to the bride when your tipi is ready. I gave away my only horse! I lend you my black stallion. I lead fawn to your tent and your relatives. But I... Let me finish! They put fawns on a blanket and carry them into your teepee. It's Cheyenne custom. Fawn expects you to respect morals. I respect her, Hard Rock. The bride is newly painted and combed. From the man's female relatives. I have no relatives here. We help. This is all new to you. But for us too. You're right. We'll both go to your teepee when everything's ready. The ceremony will take place there. You exchange brief promises in front of the chief, and now... What now? You are now husband and wife. I know that you love 2 things in particular: My sister and this horse. You've been watching it since you've been here. I am giving this to you as a gift. It did not yet have a rider. His spirit is strong, like the spirit of the Cheyenne. You have to convince it to let you ride it. I thank you all. I want to tell you... I don't know how to say this. I thank you for your trust. I do not disappoint. I thank you. Hopefully he doesn't get injured. The stallion or harmonica? Untie him, but nice and slowly. Take away the cloth! * unverstï¿½ndlich * Yes! * fast, happy music * Thank you my old man I'll do you a favor sometime too. * Harmonica moans blissfully. * Oh that is good! I want to break in a horse every day. Just for that. Dafï¿½r? Yes. (screams) Ouch! I love you. Sleep well. I love you. good night my man We want to stay alive. We must pretend peacefulness. They watched our village from the mountains. Did they resist? You didn't have time. We come with peaceful intentions. - We don't believe you. The contract allows us free passage. You broke the treaty and killed our women and children. Believe me: there is peace between you and us. You talk like that because you're our prisoner. We want safe conduct to the goldfields. Yes, and then you take the land from us. You trust the white man among you. why not me No one believes you who saw the bloodbath at Sand Creek. A centurion arbitrarily ordered this attack. The army released him. Here is an army order. read him! Yes, he was fired. A government commission investigates the background of the bloodbath. Does it bring our women and children back to life? What do you think about it? I see no reason not to trust the lieutenant. you will come back You now know where we are. Don't trust them! New strife will arise if we capture them. Harmonica is right. You are free and can go. We want to live in peace with your white brothers. Thanks. It's a useless habit. The Cheyenne are more practical. We pull out all the hair. Forever. We'll show you! let me go What's going on here? A competition. Jumping with water in the mouth. It must not be swallowed or spit out. I beat you at this game. Wanna bet? We'll sort that out in a moment. I have to tell you something. I have something important to tell you! We will have a baby! What did you say? I'm having a child How do you know? I know. * cry of joy * do you see something We have to get closer. - I've had enough, dammit! Your fault for going alone. I've also seen scouts scalped. Do not worry. i see her now What is? They prepared themselves for the winter. Wait for them to hunt. No one survives the winter if you then dry out the camp. My white Cheyenne is going hunting for the first time tomorrow for the two of us. For the three of us. We need a lot of meat for the winter. Was the little guy kicking? Of course, I felt it! Now? Sleep, fawn! You need rest. I love you. Sleep well. Good night, harmonica. We don't find any meat here either. The whites killed most of the buffalo. The rest fled. We're going hunting again tomorrow. Maybe we'll meet a herd of buffalo? Have I shown you that I can whistle like a bird? Look out! Why are you laughing? Fawn taught me. She didn't tell you it's our dog whistle. * Everybody is laughing. * (angry) Very funny! He! (yells) No! I never hated now i hate They murdered fawn and my child. I find the murderer and avenge her death. How are you going to find him? What's the use of finding that one killer? He shall die. Fawn was your wife and my sister. I want revenge too. We must fight together for the survival of our people. I can't live with myself if I don't kill him. Come with us! I can not. I can't stay with you. Our gods accompany you. The memory of life with you accompanies me everywhere. I'm burying fawn now. I know you want a fire too. But the wood is damp. We have to go on. Come! This is exhausting for you. You're hungry, my good fellow. We haven't had a day's rest so far. But we have to find him. We must find him! Is there anything I can do for you? Do you have room for my horse? More than enough. The stable is empty. A very handsome stallion, gosh. Give him oats or hay. We've come a long way. All right sir! A beautiful animal. Fabulous. The town is almost empty since the road to Montana was cleared of Cheyenne. Nobody believed that the army could do it so quickly. Damned! But I have no use for it. Do you ride to the goldfields of Montana? Maybe. I am looking for a friend. Bill Simmons wore this chain around his neck. I haven't seen her on him for a long time. Yes, his name is Bill. I've been looking for him since Bull Run. He's safe in the saloon when he's not at his ranch. Hope you recognize him. He's got a big bruise since the last fight with the Cheyennes. (laughs) A fine Indian scratch on the face. (Thoughts) One of you is. Who has the scratch? He does not. Neither does he. which one is it What can I get you, handsome? Nothing thanks. You have to order something. Otherwise you can't sit here. A whisky. Good. (Thoughts) He must be here. Maybe the big one over there? Turn around so I can see your face. which one is it Show your faces! It's not you. You neither. Now you turn around! Turn around! What's wrong with you? Forgiveness. * He whistles a tune. * Mary, I'm home! I can not. * Harmonica plays his song. * stop it Nobody is there anymore. Quitting time! I hope it's enough for the whisky. Otherwise you have to sell your horse. * Harmonica plays a snappy song. * I'm going crazy! It really is you! Accordion! I worried about you very much and thought the red hats were killing you. Apparently they just captured you. Did they torment you? you look terrible They killed Fred. I only have one arm left. That's a long time ago. you look really bad Hey, shut up! listen to me A great man is here today. Nobody recognized him. This is harmonica. I'm proud that he's my friend. I lost my arm to the Cheyenne. He was caught. They tortured him for almost a year. How could he escape? - That is interesting. Tell us how you escaped. Poor guy can't talk about it, it was that bad. Let's have a drink with him. He shall forget how the barbarians tormented him. Cheers to my friend harmonica! Hip, hip... (all) Hooray! Danger! Thank you gentlemen. The photographic recording is finished. You are Jack Birch, called Harmonica. My friends call me that. I'm from the Boston Spectator, harmonica. Only my friends call me that. What was your worst experience with the savages? What did he say? They tormented and tortured him. On a board with nails. He hung upside down from a tree for days. Did they torture another white man? Long live our harmonica! - (all) Up! Did you survive by believing in civilization? Nobody tormented me! These are not barbarians! I do not want to forget. Only the memory of the days there keeps me alive. You are the barbarians! You killed my wife, my child and my friends. Leave me alone now! Leave me alone. He's gone mad. Folks, the savages are coming to town! You take them to the reservation. They are already very tame. Stay away from them! The big one is dangerous. He is a Warchief. Be careful! Hang 'em, beat 'em to death! No no! Hands off my wife! You damn bastard! (yells) No! *cheyenne dog whistle* Was there something in the forest? - I heard nothing. Maybe a raccoon. Maybe it was a deer? Do you want juicy roast? Then catch it. Is something? where are you Help! * Shot * * 2 Schï¿½sse * We are blood brothers now. my life is your life your life is mine Our blood has mixed. I'm proud of you. My heart is happy. The line shows the road to Fort Reno and on to Fort Kearny. They bring our brothers to the reservation that way. Our band will grow. We can then risk larger liberation actions. We want to save many of our people from the reservation. *rhythmic music, drums* are you ready my brother Vorwï¿½rts! * Shots ring out. * * Copyright subtitle: MDR 2018 *
