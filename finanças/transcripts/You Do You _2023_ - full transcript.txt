KÜLTÜR APARTMENT BUILDING TAILOR Hello, dear viewers. You've tuned into Kültür News... Why is she sneaking around like some kind of burglar in her own home? 'Cause I get to rummage through Nevra Kültür's closet, that's why! You Do You I can't open these, ma'am. They're ready for export. Dear viewers, a woman's gotta do what a woman's gotta do. Excuse me, ma'am. Stop that, please. Ma'am. Now that this is open, you can all clearly see, that these crates are filled with nothing but foam. This is yet another instance of fraudulent exporting. Oh, what a shame. This kind of journalism just doesn't exist anymore. Merve! Have you been going through my closets again? It's only for a job interview, Mom. I'm assuming you want me to look good. Merve, honestly, how many times do I have to remind you that those clothes are mine? And look at you! None of that even matches. I called in a favor to get you that interview, and that's what you're wearing? That's right. I wanted to see Leyla Madrali, editor of the best fashion magazine in Turkey, and instead you send me to a finance manager. I'm going to be a fashion designer. - How often do I have to remind you? - What's in the folder? Nothing. I might run into Leyla. Maybe she'll look at my stuff. Bye. - You know that fashion is just a fantasy. - Ugh! You have a degree in business! Merve! Mercury is in retrograde! You've got to take precautions. Not retrograde! What does that mean? Goddess, give me strength! Trust Şehmuz, honey! Here's a bunch of sage. Right before the interview, tear it up and go sprinkle it around the room. Tear it up, or it won't smell! Don't forget the corners. Şehmuz, they don't need more reasons to throw me out. - Sabotaging yourself again? - Hell yes! Wow. You're so predictable! That is such a surprise! Hello! - Do you like my new look? - Stunning. You're my very best model. Wait. Herbs and cheese. It's your favorite. Have a bite. - It's good for your brain. - Mmm. You're the best cook in the world. What would I do without you? Okay, I'm off. - Good morning. - Good morning! Wow, I love what you did with that pocket. That's an outer-pocket. They don't make them like that anymore. I'm sure Nevra gave you an earful about your outfit. She said it was perfect. A perfect mess. She's insisting I get an office job. I couldn't handle that, Hamdi. You shouldn't complain. Complaining will just bring about negativity, you know that. Besides, your mother just wants you to be independent and make good money. That's all. But I'm not interested in money. I just want to be a designer. My mother should know that by now. Sure about that? Yes. Their only income is rent money, sir. Then it's time, I guess. - Tell the residents they're being evicted. - Yes, sir. Right away. Well... You certainly have a unique sense of style. That's what they always say. I actually get that a lot, Levent. Thank you so much for your time. So, does this mean that I'm hired? Hmm. Good one. It's refreshing how forward you are. I think I've got to butter this guy up a bit more. Geez. Your mother and I go way back. She's quite the distinguished journalist, and she's a very classy woman. Were you also pining for my mother? - Beg your pardon? - Oh, everyone's in love with my mother. And since you're extolling her virtues, I was just curious. So you've got a Bachelor's in Business Administration. - Where did you last work? - That's a bit complicated. - You have no experience. - I don't have the will to work. Why not? Do you know what kind of damage capitalism and corporations are inflicting on the world? It's soul-murder, poisoning us like white sugar! I refuse to let my creative soul be stifled! All the money in the world can't replace my creative genius! Oh, I do love a bit of drama. Stand clear of the doors. Oh, you've definitely got some swagger. Which I'm sure you couldn't possibly understand working in this drab place. Oh, sure. I mean, what do I know? The photoshoot for your new collection - is confirmed for Galata, Leyla. - Hmm. And your driver is ready for you. Wait a minute. Did you say Leyla? Leyla who? Leyla... What Leyla? Leyla Madrali. She's the editor-in-chief of our magazine. You brought along a portfolio, I see? Oh, no. These are just some accounting and finance documents. Oh, I see. Stand clear of the doors. Oh, no. Erdem? Merve? Erdem? You've got to be kidding me. You can't do this to me. I'll be right back. Don't worry. Merve, honey. - Just hang on a sec. - So you're cheating on me now, Erdem? - How long has this been going on for? - No. It's nothing like that. Then who is she? You got a sister I don't know about? There's some cheating happening, but I'm cheating on her with you. You see the difference? Excuse me? Listen, I really care about my girlfriend. Now that she's seen you she's getting suspicious. So let's go over there, and maybe you can say that you're my sister or my cousin. Would you do that? For me? Pretty please? You like cheating on me now? Tell me you like cheating on me now! Merve! Coming to this place always makes me feel better. I just wish it wasn't always so crowded. Whoa! Sorry, I didn't see you there, babycakes. Don't worry about it, "Babycakes." I'm home. What's going on? Did someone die? Şehmuz? Gülgün? Hamdi. Nevra? Hey, can you guys please stop playing the name game and tell me what's wrong? Mom? - Your father. - My father? What hell does this have to do with him? He's gone and sold the building. - Which building? - Honey, which building do you think? - He's sold this one. - But why? Because he's broke. And now he owes the bank a ton of money. So what if he's broke? What does that have to do with us? We're homeless now. A lawyer came by earlier. We need to be out of the building two months from now. Why can't we just buy the building? We're penniless. There's no way we can buy it. Human beings can be so powerful when they focus on something with sincerity and clear intentions. I believe in the power of positivity. That makes no sense, Şehmuz. A construction company bought this place. They'll tear it down and build something new. This is about money. How can we stop those kinds of people? I just can't open up a new shop somewhere else. It's over. I'm ruined. Well, my tarot cards don't say anything about us moving, Hamdi. - You'd be the first to know if they did. - You know, my plants, and my cats, they couldn't handle a big move like that. I'm not going anywhere. Hang on. Why is this even an issue? He abandoned us 15 years ago. Aren't you guys divorced? Didn't you put the building in your name after the divorce so we could own it? Or is it registered in my name? Who's the owner of this building? How can they just throw us out of here? Mom? Tell me you guys are divorced, Mom. How can you not be divorced? It's been 15 years! Why isn't this place in my name? Answer me, Mom. Hm? Mom, please. Getting a divorce is my decision and mine alone. He's got a kid with another woman! Did you think by not getting a divorce, he would come back to you? What are you talking about? I would murder him if he ever set foot through those doors. Oh, you didn't get a divorce so that he couldn't remarry. You've always got to have things go your way. Well, look at us now! You should've thought of someone other than yourself. Karma will always come around and bite you in the ass, or something. Isn't that how it goes? You said we were penniless? I've been retired for years now, Merve. We can't live off that. We'll just have to move out. I know this is a huge responsibility, honey. But you're gonna have to get off your ass and find a job. This is a nightmare! Nil. Nil? Damn it. My battery's dead. Nil? Murat? - That was amazing. - Yeah, it was great. Your timing couldn't be better. - Bravo, Merve. - The current was strong enough. Might be a bit too high. I think she's in shock. - Oh. - I got her. What's happening? Okay, okay! What current? Stop it! What current? What shock? The guys have developed a new security system, and now they want me to promote the thing. I think we might actually get lucky with it. And now I don't have to wear myself out thinking of a startup idea. Are you serious, Nil? You really like my idea? Give me a break. You're gonna live in people's houses dressed as a bear? I'll make bear costumes and sell them. That's where the real money is. Well, this is a perfect way to end my terrible day! Being electrocuted by my best friends! Hey, what's wrong with her? So that's the deal. Wow, that is really bad. Those people are my family. I can't imagine living somewhere without them. I've got to find a way to buy that building back for them. You know you sound insane. Yeah, I know. According to my mom, we're broke. All I really need to do is develop an app, and then I could sell it and buy back the whole neighborhood, let alone one building. But I need a fresh new idea. A stroke of genius. And all these guys do is check out girls. Tugba2002? We should come up with a dating app. That's where the money is. Yeah, but it's hard to get to know someone when you've met them on the internet. Like Erdem. I fell for his pic and bio. Look what he did. Okay. So let's make an app just for women, so they can find their soulmate. Sure, make fun of me. Dating apps suck, because you want to trust the person. But everyone's always got a mask on. Well, hang on. I wouldn't be scared to tell the truth if I was wearing a mask. Okay, say something true, then. I love you, Nil. That's really not funny, Murat. This is well-done. So let's say there was an app where everyone is wearing a mask, and because everyone's anonymous, they'd be more willing to say what's on their mind. And what good would that do? Maybe total honesty is the best way to find out if someone is your soulmate. I don't know about that, Merve. On second thought, you might be onto something. An app just for people looking for a soulmate. All those hopeless romantics looking for the loves of their lives. Like me! I mean, I can make the masks, and we can sell them and raise funds. We charge for the video chat. I can write the code in no time. A baby could write it. The masks should be animals. Animals don't lie. I think you'd look good as a sad gazelle. Do you think this is something that could work? - For sure. - I do, yeah. How are we gonna sell it? With the right marketing, I can sell anything. I'm on it. Don't worry about it. - We are doing this. - We're doing this. Hey, by the way, keep your mitts off Emre. He's mine. Give me a break, Nil. I'm not that desperate. Look at my track record with men. My own father betrayed me. And you should confront him about it. He deserves it. He can rot in hell. He's the reason I'm going to be homeless. So find a job and get to work, then. You'll find your own place. My family didn't leave me with a home to inherit either. Look over here. Check this out. This place is empty, and the rent's cheap. Work during the day, and make your designs here at night. Here? No way. I need to be comfortable to be productive. Holy moly, you sound like a little princess. What, you can't get creative without a snuggle from your mama? Were you able to show Leyla your portfolio? No. She's on vacation. She must be at her summer place. Come on, Merve. I'm just not good at talking myself up. I get shy and weird and I say stupid things. I've told you a hundred times. Get your Instagram page set up, come up with a hashtag, post pictures of all your clothes, and there's your brand. Set up Instagram. Find a hashtag. Make a brand. So, anyone in the company is able to log on and watch this interview? Uh-huh, you got it. And the amount of likes you get, determines if you get hired or not. Hmm. It feels weird wanting to get such a boring job. See? There you go. The system works. Merve, what is it about fashion that really drives you? I'm passionate. And I think that everyone has the right to express their outlook on life through the way that they dress. Fashion has always been the best way for me to express myself. So, instead of being a way to make your mark in a multi-billion-dollar industry, fashion sounds more like a hobby for you. Like me, please. I'm a very sweet person! Just give me some likes. On the contrary. I'm a total capitalist. All money all the time. I'm just here for the money. Listen, sweetheart, we rose in this industry because we love cotton and thread. And now we're heads above all of our competitors. But there's one thing we lack. - Humanity? - Huh? No, not at all. Trust me when I say I'm a very good person. The one thing we just don't have is a creative vision. I'm great with vision! Look at me! This outfit screams vision. I like your attitude. I'm not gonna lie. And right this way is where you're gonna be working. - Wait, you're hiring me? - Uh-huh. Oh, thank you very much. This is amazing. Thank you so much. My pleasure. The final pressing is the most important part. It's the heart of this job. You need to keep that in mind while you're working. Okay, honey? I wish you the best of luck. Hello. I'm shaking, Merve. This is a miracle. What's going on? I managed to get us a meeting with Anil Gürman. And who is he? Oh, you're clueless! Anil is a startup guru, and one of the biggest investors in the market. And he's a huge flirt. Drop the lady off wherever she wants. When do I get to see you again, Anil? Hmm. He's a really strange guy. He lived in China for years. When he got back, he founded WhatIsThis, the e-commerce platform. Then sold it back to China. He's rich. He's beyond loaded. Good morning. - I'll circle back to you. - This is totally surreal. The startup projects are taking up too much time. It's starting to cut into my other work. You can handle it all. I just wish one of them was actually exciting to me. - "Soulmates?" - Mm-hm. - What's this one? - Some kind of dating app. I think it's silly, personally. They want to pitch it to you as soon as possible. I guess they don't realize everybody says that. - Merve Kültür's got a startup going? - Oh, you know her? Get them in here tomorrow morning. - Cancel my other meeting. - Uh, okay. - Consider it done. - Hm. This is an incredible opportunity. We really gotta wow them tomorrow at WhatIsThis. We're absolutely gonna close this deal. And, listen, don't be afraid to wow them with your outfit, okay? Yes. Merve? - Not again. - What? I'm heading to a very important meeting right now, Mom. - Are you going to a cabaret? - It's not an interview this time. We're pitching our idea to a big investor. If he likes it, he'll give us money to start it, and when it becomes popular, we'll be able to sell it for more money to another investor, then we'll be rich enough to buy the building. Yeah, saying it out loud makes it sound crazy. Great plan. I'm sure the neighbors will feel better when you tell them. This is how the world works now. Get used to it. Why do you think it's okay for you to dress like that, huh? This is my style, Mother! My style! Ugh! Oh, so your "style" trumps all of my years of actual experience, does it? Guess what? If someone had that getup, and had the nerve to ask me for money, I wouldn't even give them five cents. Understand? Not even five cents! And I thought I told you to stay out of my closet! Your style trumps my experience. Are you going to a cabaret? I really like your style. Would you mind taking a picture of me? Oh, wait. With this. Okay. And like this? Thank you so much. "You do you." We'll see how far this goes on Instagram. If I had your style, I'd be flying high, babycakes. But you're already high, "babycakes". "You do you." NEW POST - MERVE KÜLTÜR #YOUDOYOU Wait and see. - Thank you so much. - Enjoy. - Whoa! - Watch it. Ow! Ow! It burns! - Ugh. - Good thing you didn't get my shoes. Are you always this clumsy? Is that supposed to be an apology? What kind of a person are you, man? Look at my pants! You ruined them. What a self-important smart-ass you are. Glad your shoes are okay! That sociopath is gonna make me late. Ugh. Wow. That's a pretty good camouflage job. Your fashion sense is still intact. Good thing you have that, considering how clumsy you are. "Clumsy?" Your jacket has nice buttons on it. Excuse me, I'm late. You think it's smart to wear a mask to a meeting? Look at how people are reacting! I can't see anything. Everybody is staring at us. We've piqued their curiosity. Good morning. And welcome, you guys. We're so grateful that you made the time for us, Mr. Gürman. - Some introductions? - Mm-hm. This is our incredible art director, Murat. Welcome. I love that mask. Our coders, Fikret and Ali. And this is Merve. She's the founder of our app, and our creative genius. Well, I'm already very impressed by her creative mind. - I'm very sorry about this morning. - Oh, no, no, no, um... Because I'm a self-important smart-ass, I'm actually the one who should be apologizing. Do you guys know each other? Let's start. We don't have much time. Please go ahead. Maybe this is what Şehmuz was talking about when he said Mercury was in retrograde. But I think the stars might be screwing with me now. So let's begin. All right, Murat, what's our catchphrase? Mask your face, not your heart. Yes. So for example, Murat the bear will come across Merve's gazelle profile. He'll sign up to pay for a chat... And because he's wearing his mask, the anonymity will allow him to share his innermost thoughts and dreams. And through this honesty, he'll be able to find his soulmate, who'll accept, love the man behind the mask. And Murat, who is a very gifted artist, will be custom-making these masks, which we can sell to our members. So in summary, our app, which we've called Soulmates, should start being tested as soon as poss... Begin immediately. Come up with a Beta version, and I'll cover the finances. I'll hold onto 50% of the shares, and cover your expenses. And you'll also have to use our server infrastructure, all right? Great. Have a nice day, guys. - Wow. - Thank you. - Yeah, Let's go. - Let's get out of their hair. Merve? I'm really sorry about this morning. I was just... totally out of line. - Would working at WhatIsThis interest you? - Working as what? The ready-to-wear division needs some new blood. Merve's an amazing fashion designer. I wouldn't call myself a designer, per se. It's more of a hobby, really. What do you think, Seza? She can start right away. It's your call. Whatever you say goes. - You're going to pay me in advance, right? - Merve. Just kidding! I'm a big jokester, but I'm a hard worker. And I don't bore easily. I mean, at work. I don't get bored at work. - I'm very serious person. - Time to go. - Thanks a lot, again. Okay, I gotta go. - Yes. Come on, honey. So, what did you think of that? It's complete garbage. Why would you wear a mask to look for your soulmate, or pay for video chat? There are tons of apps where you can do anything you want for free. Aren't you looking for your soulmate? I do not have time for relationships. Everyone knows that about you. So why are you investing in this if you think it's nonsense? Shouldn't I be allowed to have a little fun sometimes? - The new girl is yours. - I don't need any new people. Even better. Make her your little servant. I want to see her run out of here crying. Okay, but why? KÜLTÜR CORNERS PHANTOM EXPORTER FAMOUS BUSINESSMAN SEDAT GÜRMAN PASSED AWAY So, today, we not only found an investor for our app, but I also finally found a job. Our plan is underway. We'll develop our app, and with the money we get from that, we're going to buy this building back. - Amazing. - Bravo! - Somebody's grumpy. - He's a skeptic. - Merve, we toast to you. - Yes. I knew these youngsters were gonna save us. This is the stupidest plan I've heard in my life. It'd be quicker to end poverty than to convince Nevra Kültür to change. Nevra, what kind of plan have you got, then? We're grasping at straws here. Come on, I've prepared a feast for us, because we've been moping around here for days. Enough is enough! Cheer up! I believe in her. Merve is going to save us all. Well, actually, we're a team. We're all going to do it. Gülgün, your food is absolutely delicious. - Yes? - You should make it into your business. Thanks, dear. I've considered it, but I never had the finances for it. And I'm certainly not much of an entrepreneur. Well, isn't it lucky that I'm an entrepreneur? You handle the cooking, I'll handle the marketing. - Hmm. - Well, all I really want is to be onstage! Oh sure, that's exactly what the world needs. A man can dream, can't he? Ooh! Look, look, look, look. Nil. There's something on the horizon for you. A bridal veil. - See? Right there. - Ohh. Our investor, Anil Gürman, is very handsome. Or maybe you like him. Not a chance. Did you say the investor's name is Gürman? Yeah. So what? Hm. Just sounded familiar for some reason. Oh, look. Hey, can't you hear all the alarms? You're gonna wake up the whole neighborhood. Mom. No. They said I could go in whenever I want. - Hey! Get up now! - No, I can go in whenever. Oh my god, this noise is unbelievable. - Hey! Merve! Get up. - Huh? Come on. Up you go. Come on, look at me. Open your eyes. Look at me. - Are you awake now? - Sure am. Come on. Get yourself ready. Hurry up! Okay, I'm getting ready. Mom, what the hell? There are too many colors on that, and it's messy. The first impression is most important. I'm going to win them over. Good morning, ma'am! Don't call me "ma'am," Kültür, just Seza. - At WhatIsThis, we only use first names. - That's great. I've dreamed of being in an informal and friendly - working environment. - Oh, really? Well, don't get too comfy. In this office, the day starts at 8:30. Come in late tomorrow and you're done, Kültür. My name's Zeynep. Uh, good luck to you. - This is your desk. - Oh. Go down to HR and get a computer. You need to be proactive. Anil's philosophy is that each person takes responsibility for themselves. We need to find you a job. Well, Merve is a fashion designer, you know, Seza. Yeah, I'll bet. Go down to the warehouse and make a chart of the ready-to-wear items. Report all the sizes that are missing and the ones that aren't. Then look at our competitor's websites and do a comparison chart, and make notes on all the discrepancies. Bring it to me tomorrow. Is it me or was that a lot? Just watch yourself. Someone's always listening. Ah. I get what you mean. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Oh, by the way, don't think that I'm your friend now. I've got just as much power as Seza does. I'm beginning to understand why my mother loves these environments so much. Huh. Excuse me. I'm good, thanks. - Is the warehouse flooding? What's wrong? - It is now 7:00. Here's the report you wanted from me. Garbage. Do it again. I'm here. Merve? - Huh? - Come and check out what we're doing. So you'll see avatars as long as you swipe right. - Yeah. - If you tap on them, the chat will appear. And after both parties accept the chat... - The video chat. - My god, you guys, this looks amazing. Why doesn't the video chat come up? There's a glitch. Okay. Well, I'm sure we can get you a package... Uh... What? Oh. This is unbelievable, Murat. Wow. You're an incredibly talented artist. This one's a special order. Someone's driver is coming to pick it up. We have customers with drivers. Wait. I have another surprise. I finished your mask. It's beautiful! I can't believe it. It's gorgeous, Murat. - It looks great. - Does it? It really does. Nil! Aren't Murat's masks just amazing? Shh. Sorry about that. Can you repeat that? I'm nothing. I don't exist. Don't give up on her, all right? Talk to you later. Bye. Nil! Nil! Let's put some music on! Let's dance. Come on! Everybody, put your masks on. Come on, put them on. Listen. We should throw a party. And everyone can come wearing their masks. And at midnight, the masks come off. Like a masquerade. What do you think? Merve Kültür, I knew you were a creative genius! I can't wait to see everyone dance. - Can you even see out of that? - No. Merve, give this to him. No problem. Here you go. Have a nice evening. Stop. You can keep driving. - Good morning. - Good morning. Hey, what are you doing here so early? Every morning he comes in here and talks my ear off. This isn't a cafe, you know. I bring a bit of color into your boring life. You're welcome. Not much time left till I'm rid of you and your little energy thingies. What are you talking about? No one's going to have to move. We're going to save this building. I already told him. But the stubborn old fart never listens. These pockets are really stylish. Shouldn't you be going to work? I'm mentally preparing. They have it out for me. It's like they just hired me to make my life hell. You have to be smart about it, Merve. I say you make a game out of it. Just don't let them push you around. - The things people did to me. - I'm glad the job's just temporary. We've got to get on with the plan. We still don't even know who owns the building now. Why don't you go ask your father? Hm? It's getting late. I better go. - Bye. - Bye. And there she goes. I just think she should confront him about it. It seems weird that it's such an issue. Her mom would be furious. Merve's still just a kid. When my father disowned me, I never got to tell him how I felt about it. Then he passed away. And now, every night, in my head, I have a big argument with him. Well, you're kind of a kid too. You can't grow up unless you're able to stand up to your parents. That's been sold. Oh, but that doesn't work on its own. At least let me pair it with these. They only bought this. Seza, my office right away. You're no longer working in ready-to-wear. Go to the main warehouse to do inventory. Make it into a game? All right, I'll do that. You want me to fire her? No. Not just yet. Honey, why do you care who I sold the building to? I mean, I know it was a bit unfair, now that I think of it. But I've also been having a hard time. - Everything changed after my son was born... - But I'm your daughter. That building was supposed to be mine too. Yes, that's true. But now you're an adult. - You're 26 years old. - I'm 24! Right, 24. It still feels like yesterday they were giving you to me at the hosp... But Dad, I was born at the studio. Remember Mom was working right to the end? Sure, that's right. The studio. That's where they handed you to me, and you were so sweet. Except you weren't even there, you were away on safari, remember? Oh. Right, a safari. Look, you really shouldn't dwell on this. You're my daughter, and that's why you can achieve anything you want to do. This difficult stuff will make you stronger. I want you to be as strong as I am. Don't worry, when you're older, you'll understand that I did you a favor. No, I should be honest this time. - You want me to be strong, huh? - Mm-hm. You abandoned me when I was at my most vulnerable! You took off, and it left an enormous, gaping hole in my psyche! And now I'm trying to fill that bottomless, insatiable void by trying to find a sense of safety, which I always look for in the most despicable of men! And to top it all off, now you've gone and sold my home, my safe place! You've left me broke, desperate, and completely traumatized, so what should I do now, Dad? Live on the street? Then you have the audacity to call what you're doing a favor? Some favor, Dad! That went pretty well. Honey. Um... Is there something I can do for you? Like... money? Would giving you some money help? What are you doing, Mom? These are pretty valuable. We'll need to pack them carefully. You're not packing anything. We're not leaving this apartment. This stays right here. We don't have any money. They're going to cut the power off soon, we can't pay the bill. - Here, you can pay the bills with this. - What's that? - Money. - I've got a job now. Jobs don't pay newbies in advance, so where'd you get that money from? - I did get an advance. - Your 3rd day working at the warehouse? Exactly. They told me I'm an over-achiever. Did your father give you that money? Boy, she's good. I can't hide from an ex-journalist. So what if I did? He's my father. Didn't I tell you not to go and see that man, even if we're starving in the dark? Everything that's happening is because of him! Never go see him again, got it? Never again! All right, fine! We'll have to resort to eating tree bark, but far be it for me to stand in the way of your pride. Everything revolves around you, right? I thought you'd be glad I'm trying to save the building, but all you've been doing is judging me at every turn. And you can't tell me not to go see him. If you'd been a little less self-righteous, I might have had a chance at growing up with a father! And maybe you should use your incredible journalism skills to find out who bought this building! Because I can't seem to do anything right for you! I'm really starting to enjoy a good mic-drop. Like this? Oh, wonderful. Wow, sweetie. Next one. There. This is perfect. SOULMATES MEETUP PARTY Come on, let's go! What's up? I started doing research into some of the clothing lines on various e-commerce platforms. Why? You did say you wanted fresh blood in ready-to-wear. Right. I certainly wouldn't be sitting here if I cared about the competition, Kültür. They should be following me. "How much longer do I have to put up with this place?" "Just stick it out, honey. Soulmates is becoming popular." "Anil's planning on bringing Chinese investors to our party." "Don't even get me started on that guy!" What do you think you're doing? That's a really nice suit. Is it ready-to-wear? Excuse me? Is it ready-to-wear, or custom? It's ready-to-wear, Kültür. I think your suits should be tailor-made. A detail-oriented man like you should at least be wearing a custom-made jacket. Look at these pockets, they don't say anything. You need outer-pockets, if you want my opinion. Did you know that the best tailor in Istanbul is my neighbor? - I can introduce you... - Just get back to work. Keep working. And that's what I like to call "confusing my boss". Hello, Kültür the gazelle. Hello. Hello. Hello. SOULMATES GAZELLE GAZELLE K., 24 Hello, Kültür the gazelle. Oh. It's Soulmates. Let's see if this app is working. Wow, a wolf. Oh! It's going to the video chat. Let's get the money flowing. Your mask is really nice. Yours too. Thank you. I suppose I should be scared of you. Why? You're a wolf, and I'm a gazelle. You're a predator. You could tear me to pieces. - Well, let's hope that doesn't happen. - Hm, I hope not. Do you live in Istanbul? Yes. You? I'm in Istanbul too. So, what do you do? I'm a workaholic. And what about you? Uh, that's a little complicated. I'm working at my dream job, but in a way that I really don't like. Interesting. So... what's your biggest life goal? I really want to be a fashion designer, but right now all I care about is making money. I have to make a huge amount of money. How do you plan on making that huge amount of money? I would rather hear about you. It's your turn to talk. What's your biggest life goal? Avenging my family. Wow. So you're going to get your revenge on the evil hunters? Come again? I mean, since we're talking gazelles and wolves. Maybe the hunter kills a wolf pack, but the little wolf gets away, and then grows up facing enormous hurdles and sorrow. And then one day, it ambushes the hunter... Huh! He hung up on me. That must have been a bit too much honesty for him. Yikes, I wonder what that poor guy's been through. The wounded wolf. All right, gazelle. We're doing this. Excuse me. - I can take your photo. - No, no, it's not that. Aren't you the "You do you" girl? Yes. We're part of your cult now. You're amazing. I've created a whole style for myself with your WhatIsThis pairings. Do you like this? Huh. It would appear I've created a monster. Just keep being yourself, honey. And don't let anyone stop you. Not even me. See you. - Bye. - Bye-bye. - Oh, she's so cool. - Right? She's so nice. - Yeah. - Her pants match her vest. So cool. I love her. Oh wow! I really have become a cult. 60K FOLLOWERS Kult. Merve Kult. The voice of the street. - Hello there. - Hello, sir. How can I help you? I'd like a sport jacket, custom. Do you have any particular design in mind? I'd like something with outer-pockets. Why's that? I want something new and unique. I know a few things about fashion myself. Hm. If you did, I don't know why you'd leave your house wearing that outfit. Mister, I'm a paying customer. - Why are you speaking to me like that? - Listen, I just say what I see. This will be one of my last jobs. I'm being evicted. So you either put up with it, or you can buy something from a crappy store and stop wasting my time, okay? I see you brought your own fabric? Yes, and it's very rare. I suppose you bought this without ever looking at it. I'm sorry? Sports jackets can't be made out of this material. Uh, what's a sport jacket made out of then? Just leave that to me, all right? Hm? ANIL GÜRMAN CEO - WHATISTHIS How did you hear about me? It was a recommendation. That was kind of them. Oh. It's the wolf. Oh, I don't have my mask. What do I do? Um... Just hang on. I'll be right with you, I have to finish something. GAZELLE Almost done. I'm still at work. I'm just finishing up my supper. WhatIsThis is taking over my whole life. It must be nice to work for yourself. You're so lucky. I created all of my own luck. I'm sure you can do it too. No one gives a damn about me here. - What would you do if they did? - What would I do? What a good question. I've been thinking about that. Listen, all of our competitors have ready-to-wear brands of clothing of their own. Except WhatIsThis doesn't. And of course I understand that they want to be unique and exclusive, but there are waves of creativity on the streets, and people are craving an outlet. I was thinking we could have a competition, and all kinds of creative people could participate in it. Also, we could then have the winner design a new collection, which would be great promo for WhatIsThis, as well as giving creative people more opportunities. It hits so many targets. I think I'm talking too much. He's gonna run. Why don't you share that idea with your boss? Yeah, I'm not sure he'd listen. Well, if you don't take a step, you'll never move forward. There's always someone else ready to take what you want. Good advice. Is that some kind of proverb or what? It's my motto. I learned it from a teacher in China. That's amazing. I'm really glad that we're getting closer. But I'm worried that my boss might be watching. I get the impression that you don't like your boss. Hm. I wish that my boss could be more like you. Anyway, I'm going to take your advice, wolf. Bye. Bye. Anil, I'm so hungry. I hope you're taking me somewhere nice tonight. Hmm. Thank you. Have a good night. Here. This is a joke, right? Don't you like lamb sandwiches? You've got to be kidding me. I'm not gonna stand for this kind of treatment. Ugh. Taxi. Mmm. The blossom pattern is doing well. Increase the stock. - Seza, could I talk to you, please? - Sounds like you're already talking. So, getting to work in the warehouse has been really great for me. I've been able to pinpoint some key elements in the way WhatIsThis is working, which inspired me to come up with a really great idea. - May I share it? - Keep it short. Okay, I'll make it quick, promise. WhatIsThis should really be launching its own collection. But with a unique take. WhatIsThis should start a competition, and give new, young designers a shot. Each artist will use their preferred medium, and create different styles for the campaign with materials they already have. This will also be amazing for promotion. She stole it. She blatantly stole my idea. That's an amazing idea, Seza. Especially since we already have our marketing and delivery system in place. - That's true. - Sounds great. - Merve? - Hm? What are your thoughts on Seza's idea? You need to take a step in order to move forward. Nice work, Seza. This is a perfect initiative for the company. Let our competitors eat our dust. - Congratulations. - Thank you. That's very common in business. What would you do if you were in my position? I'd participate in the competition and win it, and get back at everyone. You definitely are a wolf. You need to take a step in order to move forward. I think I talked too much again. You're coming to the party, right? A wolf is unpredictable. He hung up on me again. Why the hell did he hang up again? Why did he do that? There must be something wrong with me. It's perfect. I've never had any kind of clothing fit me so well. Well, excuse me for saying so, but this jacket is "the shit." Can you add these buttons to it? Hmm. They're beautiful. They'll look really nice on this. Who's the man who was just here? My clients are entitled to their privacy, dear Nevra. Oh, please! What are you, some kind of psychologist? I've been seeing his car for weeks. He watches the street. Anil Gürman. Merve's employer. Huh. And what's he doing here? I don't know. He said he wanted a custom jacket made by the tailor from the building where he spent his childhood. That's too much of a coincidence. - Don't let Merve know about this. - All right. This jacket is gorgeous. So detailed. And I'm crazy about these pockets. I can't believe everyone's actually here. I can't believe everyone actually showed up wearing their masks. I guess it's good to know yourself. Hey! You having fun? - Awesome! - It's finally midnight, everyone! Those of you seeking your soulmates... are you ready? When the lights go out and the music stops, that's your moment to decide! You look amazing. - You too. - Soulmates has brought you together! - Uh... - Excuse me. But the rest is up to you! - And lights out! - Anil! That's Anil! KÜLTÜR CORNERS ANOTHER ONE TO NEVRA NİL COME TO THE BAR! ANIL'S HERE. She's part of the team. - Yes. I'm with the team. - Nil? Anil's brought his investor friends from China. I didn't think they'd be wearing such obvious masks, you know? Play nice, now. Everyone, this is Merve. Merve, this is everyone. So, if you follow me, I can show you around. So you don't have a mask? Uhh, no. I'm... - I'm in business mode tonight. - Just business mode? Just business mode. Why else would I be here? You, uh... - You look very pretty to... - 'Scuse me, man. - Can I get a beer? - Um... Sorry about that. Thank you. - What did you just say? - Huh? I couldn't hear you very well before. What'd you say to me? Uh... I should probably go check on my guests. I need to, you know... I'll see you. Look at them. Instead of buying our masks, they just made their own. Freeloaders. I'm getting desperate, Merve. You need to take a step to move forward. Because there's always someone else... just waiting to take what you want. Where'd you learn that piece of wisdom? I learned it the hard way. WOLF - OFFLINE You scared the hell out of me, Murat! I love you, Nil. Why can't you tell me you love me without hiding behind a mask, then? I love you, Nil. I know. But we don't have time for that right now. Soulmates is more important. Is Ms. Nevra here? No. Well, miss, you'll need to vacate the building in no more than 30 days. And if you don't pay your overdue rent, we'll be filing for legal seizure. Have a nice day. Yeah, it'll be real nice. Goodbye! What a jerk! - Gülgün, honey. - Yes, love? My angel cards have never let me down before. They'll tell us our fortune. What are they saying? It's good. It's all good. I can't get in touch with my mom. Have you heard from her? - No. - She must be looking at apartments. I can't even fathom looking for one. And where could I even go? All I've got is my pension, cats... No one's looking for a new place. I told you, we're not going anywhere. - Uh-uh. - That's right. Nobody is going to move out. Our party was a success. And the Chinese investors are serious about buying the app. We're getting this building back. I made a promise and meant it. You're my darling girl. - Mm. - I hope you're right, Merve. - Don't worry. Mm. - Such a wonderful person. All right, I'm going. Be careful out there, honey. All right. The dragon. Hmm, I suppose those are the investors. What's next? The wolf. Betrayal. That's a bad omen! All right, everyone. I have some great news today. Leyla has graciously accepted our offer, and she'll be the head judge of our panel. - How could I ever turn you down, Anil? - Oh, please. Everyone's hot for Anil. This won't be easy. First off, I want you to know I'm excited to be here. I was thrilled to hear about a competition where creative, young designers are given the opportunity to come up with an original collection. The unique experiences will make a wonderful show. Well said, Leyla. Here at WhatIsThis, we pride ourselves on being tapped into what young people are creating. Wouldn't you agree? That means I can participate in the competition, right? Since I'm a creative, young designer? You're so funny, Merve. Wait, haven't we met somewhere? No, I don't think so. She's the "You do you" girl. You're that Instagrammer, right? We all love you at the magazine. Are you kidding me? You're lucky to have this talent. You will absolutely compete. It'll be an honor. That is, if Anil agrees to it, of course. She should definitely compete. Uh... Sure, she can compete. Thanks, Anil. All right. Now that we've settled that, let's talk about timelines. Write all this down, Seza. Stop. How dare you undermine me in front of Anil and everyone else. How dare you steal my ideas and pitch them like they're yours. Listen... Merve's not going to have much time to prepare for the competition, though. Maybe in the evenings. Starting today, you'll be working overtime every night. Straight until morning! "Straight until morning." If you're here to start a fight with me, save your breath, Nevra. - The past is the past. - Who did you sell the building to? I don't know. - What's that supposed to mean? - It means I don't know. I was in a ton of debt. Then a lawyer started badgering me, and kept raising the offer. Eventually, I decided to sell. I had no choice. Might have been a developer. I think it's somebody else. Life is funny. Sedat Gürman sold me that building so that he could pay off all of his debts. And now I've had to sell it to pay off all my debts. What goes around, comes around. I've decided to divorce you. Come again? I'm getting a divorce and I want a lawyer. Yes, but why ask me? Because you're the only lawyer I know. And I need somebody trustworthy to help me with this. - Just file the paperwork. It's been years. - Oh, but it's not that easy. My husband sold the building my daughter and I live in. - I want what's owed to me. - I'm not supposed to... No one can represent me better. - I can't... - You already know the details. How much it's worth, things like that. - I can't tell you... - Who bought it? How much did they pay? I can't. I'm the attorney for the buyer. Anil doesn't need to know. It's my husband I'm suing, not Anil Gürman. I can't do that to Mr. Gürman. Why not? It's unethical. Fine. This is what today's journalism lacks. I'm gonna make sure the mask comes off. Oh! Merve! You spilled coffee everywhere. You're so clumsy! I'm sorry. Good thing you didn't get my shoes. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. Huh? Oh, no. The power's out. I'm pretty sure the generator should kick in any second now. Sometimes you need to take a step... - Oh my... - Merve? - Huh? - Merve, are you all right? Don't worry. I'm sure the generators will come on any minute now, okay? - Oh. - Thank you. I knew that I could trust you. I really don't think you should put too much trust in anyone. - Oh, no... - Oh! Oh, Merve! Power's coming back. The generators turn themselves on and off. That's normal. Mmm. See? There you go. I'm sorry. I'm just so sensitive. You see, I have these weird fainting spells. The darkness scares me. Right... - You certainly are very sensitive. - Yes. Thanks again for letting me be a part of the competition. Well, it was all your idea. Oh! How did you figure that out? I know everything that goes on here. The mask's coming off. But you gave me the idea first. Uh... Do you think maybe we should go out? Uh, I mean... We should do it. Let's go out. - I'll get my purse. - Me too. Okay. - Anil? - Merve. - Anil! - Uh. It's okay. It's working. Don't freak out. Um, or freak out. I'm not sure what to do here. Well, maybe if the elevator made up its mind, I could freak out. Do you want me to freak out? Well it's... It's your psychological episode, - not mine, so... - Hm. - What if I just hold your arm? - Yeah, that works. Uh, sure. Okay, we made it. You can let go. Mmm. Merve? We're here. You can let go. If you want. I think I just got over my fear. Thanks to you. No, I'm pretty sure you did that yourself. You... You can do anything. Should we go out? The elevator is starting to make me feel dizzy again. Ah. Uh, right, I should... I'll call you a cab. Yeah. Uh, otherwise you might get wet. Mm-hm. I knew it. Hot and cold, just like the wolf was. - That sure is a lot of lightning. - And rain. It looks like it might be stopping. No. I don't think it'll be stopping soon. It's still pouring down. Here's what we should do. How about... - I walk with you so you don't get soaked? - Okay. - This way. - Okay. - Oh! - Oh! Hey are you all right? I'm all right, yeah. I, uh, I just got scared. - Uh, are you sure? - I'm okay. I'm okay, yeah. I'm good. Guys, I'm not going to wait for you all night. Uh... - The driver's waiting. - Right. Yeah. - So... - Good night, Anil. See you. The icon herself. Nevra Kültür. What exactly are you trying to do, Anil? I'm going to demolish that building. I want to see you suffer. You're going to pay for ruining our lives and kicking us out onto the streets. You were supposed my father's friend. Your father was weak and immoral. I was just doing my job. He was the one running an illegal export ring. We bought that building so your mother could pay off her debts. Oh! Wasn't that kind of you. You must think I'm some kind of idiot, Nevra. I never leave a stone unturned. There aren't any more journalists like me. Everything is in the folder. Customs' records, photographs, tax returns, every single invoice. You see? Concrete documents. Do you think any of it matters? No one cared about it, because everyone was doing it. Except for you. You couldn't stop. You seduced my father. And then you took our home. - You took away my childhood! - I seduced him? Your father was in love with me! - Well, everyone was. - Lies! Are you sure? Here you go, Gürman Junior. Your father sent me all these love letters. What, are you too scared to see for yourself? You listen to me. Take your building and demolish it. But I'm still Nevra Kültür. I'm perfectly capable of rebuilding my life, but don't you dare think about hurting my family members! Merve's never done anything to you! Maybe you want to get even with me, but what do you want with my daughter? - Don't you dare toy with her! - No, that isn't what I'm doing. You most certainly are! If you had any moral fiber, you would tell her who you really are, and you would stop these games you're playing. But I can tell you're as weak as your father. Cut the bullshit. Get out of Merve's life! You understand? WOLF MEET ME AT THE CAMONDO STEPS? The wolf appears again. Of course I'll be there. Take off your mask, Anil. You figured me out. Mm. So why did you want me to meet you out here? I know this is your favorite place. I followed you. I never thought he'd be so romantic. No more rain. Merve, forgive me. I didn't expect that. Forgive you? Is this about the coffee? I've already forgotten about it. Come back. I have to go. When you avoid me like this, it makes you wildly compelling, but please, just tell me what it is! When you find out the truth, you'll hate me forever. Wait! He's so attractive that the more he runs from me, the more attached I'm actually getting. Anil! Damn it! I got fired. What's wrong? Everybody's gone. What do you mean? The app is finished. MONTHLY PLAN - ANNUAL PLAN - What the hell? - Anil made it into a paid subscription. Everybody's gone. - There's no way I would pay that much. - I don't know anyone who'd pay that much. What about the investors? If I ever find that guy, oh, you better believe I'll make him pay. Merve? Guess what happened to me today. What is it? Mom, what's wrong? Look, I actually have bad news. So your bad news can't be worse than mine. You can't one-up my bad news. Have a seat, Merve. Come on. What is it? Are you going to make this all about you? I found out who bought the building from your father. Who was it? Anil Gürman. - Huh? - Yeah. His father used to own this place before we did, and it was... I'M DEPRESSED! What should we do? Come here. Look at this photograph of her. - See how many people have liked it? - Wow. Fifty thousand. Look at her followers. I don't know how she did this in one month. She did that in a month? What are you doing, Mom? Enough of this. Nobody is allowed to upset my daughter but me, okay? - Get up. - Leave me alone. Come on. Get up. Hustle, hustle. Come on. - Hurry. - I just wanna sleep. Come on, Mom. You have got over 100,000 followers on Instagram. Everyone loves you. You are Nevra Kültür's daughter. It's time to shine. You are the star of your own life. That's my philosophy. So get up, and take control of your life. Here. Take these downstairs to Hamdi. Cut them, shred them, it's up to you. Do whatever you like. Just make sure you win the competition! Are you sure, Mom? You never wanted me to touch this stuff. Of course I'm sure. The old Nevra Kültür is dead. Somebody new is coming to take her place. Fresh. I knew she was going to make this about her somehow, but I'm okay with it. Let's get the hell out of this building. We can build a new life somewhere. Sure, my sweetie. Let's move out of here. Oh, my baby. What should we do? Should we rip it apart? Yeah. I've always hated those shoulder pads. Give it. Yes! It's perfect. I'll call myself Merve Kult. The voice of the streets. Stop playing around with that and get to work. All right, all right. I'm coming. Hang on, hang on. Open your mouth. Here. There we go. I love these so much. - Good morning. - Good morning. All right, thank you so much. Next up, we've got Merve Kult's You Do You Collection. There. Okay. You're gonna kill 'em. - All right, stay calm. - Yes, easy. And Merve Kult's philosophy is you do you no matter what. Trust your gut because your instincts are always right. Ah-ha! You do you, that's the key! Woo-hoo! Wow. We really did it, huh? - Nevra looks great on stage. - It was so fun! Let's raise a glass to fashion's rising star, Merve Kult. - Cheers! - Bravo! Congratulations, my beautiful daughter. Now I can say I'm certified. And Mr. Gürman is nowhere to be found these days. Oh well. He can go to the ends of the earth, for all I care. Peace, for now at least. Good riddance to bad rubbish. I think that deserves another toast! - Hear, hear. - Bravo, Merve! - Cheers! - That's the spirit! Wounded wolves take refuge among these rocks. I broke someone's heart. Why? To get the building back. I've spent my life chasing a lie. There's no such thing as a futile effort. There is nothing you can't overcome. I lost her. The woman I love. If you really love her, go find her and talk to her. If you don't take a step, someone else will and they'll seize the opportunity. If the flowers are worth picking, you should pick them. Don't wait until they wither away only to regret not picking them. He's gone. You know, I think we might actually be soulmates. Oh, come on, Nil. Don't make fun of me. - I'm not. I'm dead serious. - Oh. What are you doing? Will you marry me please, Murat? Wait, are you serious? Of course. Yes. Yes, of course I will. Yes! I will. Careful. Easy, easy! That cabinet is very valuable. Oh, this is so difficult, I'm going to faint. Don't worry, Şehmuz. These guys know what they're doing. I just can't believe Gülgün left me all alone, today of all days! She abandons me to go cater a wedding! It's too much! I'm not strong enough to handle this much stress. I can't believe that this is happening to us. Me neither. Mom! Mom, something weird is going on! What are you doing? I'm throwing out my tapes. I'm done with holding onto the past. A friend of mine is launching an internet news channel, and I was thinking I could help with it. Kult Newsroom. - What do you think? - Great. Kult belongs to her now, I guess. - Mom, listen, there's a visitor outside. - Whew! I feel much lighter. I figure we can find a small place, and I'll pay the rent for now, while you work on your brand. I planned it all. I said we have a visitor! Will you listen to me? - Hello there. - Huh? Guys! Put everything back exactly how it was. If you ruin my energy placements, I'll slam you with a curse! - This is for you. - What? - That goes in the corner! - What is this? - What the hell? - He's so excited. Hang on. This is incredible. - Wow. - Is my lease in there as well? - Hang on, let me check. - Is my lease in there? Did you put it in? Oh, you little cutie! We're not moving out! There's been a change of plans! Hey, buddy! Take those plants and put them back exactly how you found them. Because we're not moving out! Ha-ha! All right! Congratulations, man! - Thanks buddy. - Took long enough. Finally. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Come here. - I'll be right back. Stay here. - I will. - Congratulations. - How dare you show up here? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy! Take it easy! Relax. Look, I don't want to interfere, but I have to talk to Merve. I'll let go of you. Just stay calm. Merve doesn't want to see your face. Keep away from our wedding. I have to talk to her. I just need five minutes of her time and then I'll leave. I promise. Fine. I have a studio down the block. I know. Be there in ten. Merve will meet you there. Okay. Thank you. I won't forget this, man. I'll make sure you don't forget. Here it is. My new workshop. And my home. But you're going to come help me here, aren't you? Yes, of course I will, but Nevra won't be happy about this. - I'm sure she'll get used to it. - Well... She'll get used to it. Let's get back. You're still going to be my master tailor, right? Yeah, sure. But I'm going to keep my shop too. Oh. I couldn't have thought of a better punishment, not in a million years. Serves him right. - Is he dying? - No. He's just in shock. I've got this. Is this real or am I... Am I dreaming? I can't tell anymore. Doesn't matter. I think the guy's spasming. Should we save him? He is our landlord. Merve's really letting the poor guy have it, isn't she? Merve. Merve. Merve, stop. Enough. Don't! Okay, that's enough. I think we should talk. Sure. You can say what you need to in front of everyone. I'm listening. I made a huge mistake. Please, forgive me. Oh, no problem. Okay. No, no! Please wait. Merve! Hey, you lied to me. You manipulated my emotions. I know that. And I'm sorry. I was blinded by revenge. I grew up feeling hatred. You were living in my room, in my home, living my childhood. Except... once I met you, I was so confused. For the first time in my life, I was confused. Oh, he's so smooth. Look, I've got goosebumps all over my arms. And I know I've toyed with you. But then I tried to support you. To be there for you. When I did those things, I felt like my best self. My whole life, I've been scared of strong women like you. My whole life. You're stronger than anyone I know. But I'm not scared of you, Merve. Just like her mom. My strong girl. Mom. Please let me show you my real face. No masks. Damn, he's stupid handsome. Hm? Give me some time. Your future's bright, Merve Kult. I've always trusted my gut. These are my faves so far. What are yours? Yeah, I love them. Yeah, these all look good. So we should move on to the other outfits now. Merve, what do you think? Should we move to the other outfits? Sure, let's do that. This way, Leyla. What was that saying? What goes around, uh... I can never remember that one. Moving on. Put up that last one, please. Uh... So? You still haven't given me an answer. Will you give me another chance? I guess everyone deserves a second chance.
