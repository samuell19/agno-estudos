So what can you do? Nothing, really. What are you doing? A doll. I'm like a doll, aren't I? I'm a doll. I see. Do you understand that? Nobody understands anything. It's us they don't understand. Everything is being spoiled in this world. What do you mean, everything? You know, everything. In this world... Know what? When everything is being spoiled... What then? We'll... Be spoiled... Too. Us too. Right. Is that a problem? Not at all! What have you got there? What are you sucking on? Let me see. No, no, no. What are you doing over there? What's there? Come. Where to? Some place where somethings going on. And now what? You should've been here yesterday, girls. Did we ever have fun! Well, we can't be everywhere. We're busy... all the time. So... What do you think? Well, that's not bad. But not for now. Let me see. Well... I'm off! Will you have a bit of wine, Jirinka? - I don't know. - Of course you will. Waiter, what have you got? Any special wish? A bottle of wine? No, your choice. Just a glass. Our Jarmila. Don't look now. Oh, my. You're here? It's nice here, isn't it? You must be him. Sis told me about you. Won't you even introduce me? I'm the sister. Jarmila! Will the lady have something to eat too? Yes. And something to drink too. One more glass, please. - Do you have escargot? - Sorry, we don't, but — You probably don't have rabbit either. They have venison, miss. No. That's too much. I only want a bite of something. I'll have the chicken. Is it big enough? Just a moment. And some hots d' oeuvres first. Dessert? No, thank you. Have some, Jirinka. I don't know. Sure, we'll have some. This one and this one. Don't be foolish, have some too. Can you believe she's afraid she'll get fat? What's wrong? Aren't you eating? Are you on a diet? No, that is... I couldn't stand that. I don't like sweets. Do you understand, Miss Jarmila? I have a grand appetite. I love eating. It's very good. Do you have children? Why, pardon me? It's warm in here, isn't it? - Yes, yes. - I think so, too. Oh, here it comes! How old are you? Why are you so interested? Relax. Waiter! Do you smoke at all? Could you offer me a cigarette? - Wait a minute, I'm still eating! - Pardon me. You're spoiling her. Have you got one with a filter? There, see that filth. The spoons are so heavy. What time does your train leave? In about 40 minutes. Forty minutes? We must hurry then. Waiter! The bill, please. We'll just make it by cab. Well, we've made it. Jirinka, would you be so kind as to get the paper for me? I can't understand it. I told her you were an uncle. What uncle? Well, an uncle of my boyfriend. What boyfriend? He's from Jicin. She'll tell on me. What do you mean? She'd say I go around... with old geezers. Here's your paper. - Thanks, miss. And so long. - Good-bye. Bye-bye. - Thanks. - Bye. Pardon me. You know, he didn't want to leave alone. Goodness! Mister railroad man, when does that train stop first? That one? I don't know. When it gets to the next station, I suppose. But I thought this was the Orient Express. So what? Bohemia is beautiful too. My beautiful Bohemia Who's going to pay for this? The dead don't give a damn. But you forgot to close the window. Your legs are crooked. Don't you know that's just what I based my whole personality on? Tie your legs together at the knees. Very good. You need to practice. Get me some water! Rehabilitation center. Die, die, die! Die, die, die! Can you smell that? What is it now? How this life of ours flees! It's grand that we're home. Don't you think so? What do you keep talking about? Go ahead, say it's grand that we're home. Or do you have a problem with it? - I don't. Then say that it's grand. I'll say whatever I please. Maybe I'll get a piano... if I start fooling around the way you do. What? Who's fooling around? We're supposed to be spoiled, aren't we? And I'm gainfully employed on top of it, you nut! You have milk on your breasts. But it looks good on you. Beautiful, isn't it? And why do you want to spoil us? Don't you realize we're still developing? What do you mean, developing? - What time does it leave? - What do you mean? Let me fix your hankie a bit. Marcelka said you were a scientist. A hankie, a hankie, a big, white hankie. Our good father would give you an earful. Watch your hankie. But, Miluska, this is a bit too much. Don't worry about it. She's had meningitis since birth. What about Meninx? How old is your old lady? That's it. I've had enough! This is the fifth one to leave. This isn't any fun anymore. We must come up with something better. It's so unusual. I wouldn't think it possible... as if it were a message from another world. You're heavenly and yet so human. You're from another century. Do you hear me? Julie. Please. Don't be like that. I wish you'd never come into my life! Understand? Julie? What is it? Forgive me, it was a misunderstanding. I didn't understand you. I don't know what's wrong with me today. You won't be mean to me anymore, now that you know how I love you? Julie. I don't know what you're talking about. Julie. Now I know what love means. I wish this moment would last forever. Don't be so mean to me! Life without you is miserable. You don't know what this means to me. I may have fallen in love with you. Damn. Julie. Isn't there some food around here? At least some jam? Hello! Oh, girls, what took you so long? - How are you? - Would you like some coffee? Not today. We're in a hurry. Yeah, if I were as young as you are... Youth, my youth Where have you gone? Why do tears come to my eyes At the very thought of you? What's the big hurry? Just some place else. It's no fun here today. Stay with me, girl of mine Be my friend Leave love alone - Bye-bye, new. Wait a while, girls. Don't go. Sit down. I'll make you some good coffee. Look. An angel with no wings. Look, she's got at least five crowns here. She went to get sugar for us and we've robbed her. What do you mean, we? I'm the one who stole it. So you're a thief. Yes. I'm more spoiled than you. There... It also means that I'm lying. That's nothing. Everybody's doing it. Nobody ever notices. Come along. We'll do something great, all right? We're on fire! - Julie, is that you? - Yes, it's me. Julie, I keep thinking of you constantly. I've probably fallen in love with you. You don't know what that sleepless night with you means to me. Julie. I keep waiting for you. I fear that I won't ever see you again. Don't be so mean to me since you know how much I love you. Are you there, Julie? Are you angry with me? Don't be. Forgive me, but my life is misery without you. You are from another century. I love you, Julie. I never would have thought it possible, you know? Now I know what love means. Another piece of yummy meat! Are you crazy? I don't see any other meat around here. How about this? Not that! Only fruit now. What are you saying? What fruit? I don't understand you. Do tell me you will come again. Do you hear me, Julie? - I'm still hungry. I can't hear you well. The domestic fowl. - I've probably fallen in love with you. - Chicken. My little chicken. That's too big. Steak tartare. Yes, a steak. I'll put it on a piece of bread. Yes, yes, I'll prepare some sandwiches. Julie, forgive me. Julie, I love you. I love you, Julie, but tel! me, promise me, that you won't be so mean as last time. Julie, I can't believe that this has happened to me. I've never felt anything like this. Julie, now I really think that I know what love — What are you doing? Oh, that's too bad. What's his name? You know, I don't know. I totally forgot... to ask him about that. But I've got his phone number. Are you going to see him? - Sure. Anicka, here too, please. Good gracious, girls, you're all torn. And all those bows. What else will you think of, girls? All those bows. For goodness sake, why are you taking so long? I'm waiting for you like an idiot. Where have you been? You're taking it easy here and I'm to get rid of him all by myself? Watch the bones. Watch out for the bones. Watch out for the little bones. Bone, bone, bone-eater. Girls, girls, girls, girls. How spoiled the world is, right? Kiss me... What time does your train leave? Look! Rails! I'm bored. I can't keep thinking up new things all the time. - We'll have to think of a worse life. - Yeah. Aplt, Augusta, Arsen.. Isn't he in jail? That's all the As. Now for the Bs. Balik. Too lyrical. Beranek. Whatever happened to Beranek? He started working. Coural. Horrible. I don't know that one. No, I mean it's horrible we don't have any names that start with an H. - Stop being silly. - I can't read this one. But that's Doda. Oh, I see. Hey, do you remember the one who kept saying, “What will happen to us? What will happen to us?” The one who died? Yeah. I must have his signature here somewhere. Ah, Hansel is here... and Gretel is all excited. Marie, it's me, Honza. Can you hear me? Open the door, please. Marie, please open up. I know you're home. I have to talk to you. I must explain... It was just a little misunderstanding, you see. Marenka, I keep thinking about you. Open up, please. Why don't you open that door, Marie? He keeps thinking about you all the time. Marie. Go and open the door... since he's thinking of you all the time. Please. He probably loves you. Stop twitching since he keeps thinking about you all the time. Marie. He has a wonderful voice, Honza does. Open up, please. Honzicek. Jéna. Jan. Do you love me, Jan? Look, Hans, is there something to eat? Or is that a problem? No. Why? Who says I'm saying anything? Well, then let me have his address. A pencil. Legibly, okay? I don't like you anymore. I don't like you either. But I mean it. Really. Not anymore. I don't like you at all anymore. Where are you going? All right? Where have you been? At the end. At the end of what? Well, at the end of the pool. How about that? Come. Where to? To sleep. Come on. See, I told you to come. Nah, nah, nah. - No! - We must smoke. It's so demoralizing. Demoralized, all right. Come. Come on, now. Look, a butterfly. That's what I don't understand. Why does one say... “I love you”? Do you understand? Why can't one say, for example, “Egg”? Well, there's an idea. Give me one. No. I only said it to say something. Hurry. But what if something is happening, you know? So what's happening? You really mean somethings happening? That there's something? Yeah, like when someone is no longer. Like when someone dies? - Well, let's say you. - Why me? You mean you, right? Now we're sitting here and now imagine that it wasn't us. That would be too bad. And who tells you that it actually is us? And that you really exist? Well, you do. Actually, yes. Otherwise, it would be hard to prove in your case. Look. You're not registered at this address. You have no employment, see? There's no evidence of you. There's nothing. Is something there? Let me. Something ought to happen. But what? Girls, you keep rushing off some place. Red roses, red roses How I love red roses I want them for you, my love I want to pick them just for you And lay them on your soft hair How I love red roses WOMEN NO ADMITTANCE What do you want to do there? Well, we can try some other place for once. Can't we? All right. We can try anything once. “What are you staring at?" What's he doing? Watering. What a life. How come? Getting up this early? Nobody pays any attention to us. What if we're missing something? If people only knew how cold it is in the early morning. What are you thinking of? You should see yourself right now. I'd like to know why that guy in the garden paid no attention to us. What are we doing here? Why didn't he tell us off at least? Maybe he didn't even feel sorry for us. Who cares about that old man? We're young. We're young and we've got our whole life ahead of us. You know what I was suddenly afraid of? That the old man didn't see us at all. That's stupid. I thought we'd suddenly disappeared into thin air. - What an idea! - Then why didn't he pay attention to us? Or the men on the bicycles? Well, why? Why is the water here? Why? Why is there a river? Why? Tell me. Why? Why am I cold? Why? Well, why? There, you see? We do exist after all. We are, we are, we are, we are... It's swell that we're home. Die, die, die. I'm burning, you're burning, it's burning, we're burning. Do you feel how life flies? Don't be so mean to me since you know how much I love you. What will happen to us? What will happen to us? What will happen to us? We lack evidence of anything. Now I'm lying here and now imagine it wasn't me. No more walks, all right? Right. No more walks, never again. All right? Too much. Is that a problem? Is that a problem? No problem. NO ADMITTANCE Let's go away. There's nothing here. 2nd FLOOR ENTRANCE CATERING Look, food. Well, I'm hungry. Maybe we'll find something there. Only the cold. Well, let's go then. Hurry, somebody's coming. They're gone. NO PERSONNEL TRANSPORT! My leg fell asleep. Are we here already? Let go. That's it probably. Where is it? What? The food.

Not like that. Carefully. So nobody can tell. Observe. See, carefully. That's interesting and spicy. That's excellent. Look, that animal, and the little eye it has. Smells good. That's a good cookie. Why don't we put everything on plates? Yes, let's have a real feast! There. There. What now? Mushrooms. Gee. Is that a problem? Of course it isn't. - Have you tried this green thing here? - Which one? We don't have anything to drink. Hurry, NUT“!- I can't hold it. Now. Johnny? Look here. Cakes. These are even better. This is what I call cake. Not like the sorry excuse you have. A problem, perhaps? No problem. Fashion show! THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY FOR THEM TO END UP Help! WAS THERE ANY POSSIBLE WAY TO REMEDY THE DESTRUCTION? We're drowning here. We're calling for help. Because we are spoiled. Help! Help! Help us! Help! We don't want to be spoiled anymore! EVEN IF THEY WERE GIVEN THE CHANCE, AT BEST, IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS Come, let's clear this away in a hurry. There. - If we're good... - There. - And hard working... - There. We shall be happy and everything will be wonderful. If we are going to be hard working, then hard working and good... There! Everything will be wonderful and clean. Let's clear this away too, and we shall be happy, good and hard working. Everything will be wonderful, clean and orderly... Are you crazy? We'll do everything and we'll be good and happy and beautiful and happy once again. That was quite a job, wasn't it? Yes, yes. But we've made amends for everything. But I'm happy. I'm so happy too. We're both so happy. So say it, that we're happy. Are we pretending? No. After all, we are really happy. But that's not a problem.
