What is that? A wish list. Okay, we won't have many whishes when we arrive but... at least we'll know how to get started. That's why I love her. THE LADDER What train station is this? I don't see any signs. They are the miners from the uranium mine, ma'am. Move over, dude. Film inspired by true events and stories Bucharest, Communist Romania Comrade manager, what do you think about the calamity that might come upon us? Calamity? Why is that? The atomic explosion, an atomic power plant blew up over the Russians, at Chernobyl. And the cloud comes straight to us. - Good morning, maestro! - Good morning, young man! Listen, does the theater have an anti-atomic bunker? I don't think it has it anymore. I think the sets are there, take care of them. Yes, sir! THEATER Is it OK, Pepe? You sit comfortably on the throne, dude. You smartass, you'll come to me to give you some brandy from Zalău. Good morning! How's the tech department? We're working, maestro. I want to introduce you the new executive manager of the theater, comrade Constantin Vi?an. Welcome to our theater, comrade manager! There was a real need. Good luck with that! Sir! Man, he's blind. Blind like a bat. Here it is a copy for you, comrade Ciucă has already got one for approval. You're connected, the ones upstairs love you. Until written approval comes, we will start the play reading. The reading... Kisses... Yes, I'm in my office. Don't worry. Old dogs sniffed a lot of arses. Do you take piano lessons, comrade Ciuca? No, I don't. My secretary. Comrade Condiescu, I want to be honest with you. I didn't think that a novel by the Karamazov brothers, could be adapted for stage. It's a shock to me, a huge intellectual exercise. And a great success. And the discrete blurring of the mystical origin, which I was most afraid of, was amazing. Especially when it comes from an authentic intellectual like you, it's flattering and comforting. I have to admit, I was very nervous about the approval. It hasn't been approved yet. Comrade Minister, our new Minister wanted to be sure and sent the text... I don't have time. What? I don't have time, comrade. Mr. Valeriu, I've made a crouton soup and grill. Later, later. We have to be patient, let's be patient... How come "The Searchers" would be the best western? It's getting into the stereotypes that it shows. Liberty Valance surpasses it by far. - Oana, when are you shooting? - Soon. Can you help me with the sound? Sure. Costache! You're late! I thought the communists have drafted you. No, I've managed to slip away. - I brought you a present. - What? A surprise for everyone. Ladies, anonymous students, or how the comrades want to name you, I hope you've been good, because it's here for you... Santa Claus! Artist, you artist, come in! Good evening, good evening! Hurry up! Come on, gather around... Where did you pick this poor devil? From a shooting, he was starving at the TV station. - Come on, put in the tape! - I had to go around the Chernobyl cloud. Rudolf's nose was shining brightly... - That Santa is pretty cool, huh? - He had short hair last year. I'm sure I fucked him, after an audition at Piatra Neamț. No! Santa Claus, you're wonderful. Do you want something to drink? Yes, I'm tired of milk and biscuits. And don't forget I'm watching you all, and at night, when you're dreaming, I'll enter your dreams and erase them. Not now... Yes, Mom. - At this hour? -Yes, Oana, at this hour. The ambulance took Ticu. He's in the hospital now, yes. - Dad's in the hospital. - His heart, right? - Mom, what happened? - He fell on the terrace. Your party is over? Okay, we'll talk later. OK. Mom, if you're okay, I'll be staying here, okay? No... A Victor Brauner. - Is it authentic? - Of course. Mom will love it. Sure. It's very expensive abroad. -Darling. -Yes. Darling. -Quick! -Yes? You know I can't wait too long in the morning. I know. - Mornin'. - Mornin'. It's getting harder. I think it's from the bladder. The intestines, Andrei, the curse of the family. Listen... No, not here. Upstairs. Upstairs. I think we have a leaking in the attic. I promise to take care of it. You should spend more time with us. Do you remember what you've told me in that train with the miners? That you love me, and you will love me all your life, and if humans love after death, you'll love me forever. When I get back, I promise to take care of the baby room. Yeah, right. I promise. Yes. Avram! - Yes! - I just wanted you to... Hold on. Say it quickly. - Listen... - I'm in a hurry. Could you give me 200 lei? They have sugar and vegetable oil at the store, and I want to get my gasoline ration. If my princess finds out, she kills me, 'cause we'll be running out of money. - The children are coming too... - Yeah, yeah... I'll give it back to you in a month. - One month! - One month. With eclipse. The play of the Karamazov Brothers has been approved. It hasn't been approved by the higher authorities yet. They're working like hell... The set model, Dragos will explain it later how it works. Maia, the costumes as usual. And now, the cast. - I'll sit down for a little. - Yes. Feodor Karamazov. The old father. Take a guess... George, congratulations! - Finally, right? - Cut it out! What a surprise. Let's continue. Ivan Karamazov, Alexandru Prezan. Well done, comrade! Dimitri, the second son, who's a womanizer... - It's among us for sure... - It was given, from the dressing room. And now an experiment. Smerdiakov, the bastard... - Horia Făinaru. - Allow me? Can I perform it mute? It's going to be the funniest role of my life. You can do it the way you want, it will be dramatic anyway. And now the girls. Katerina Ivanovna, Diana Cantuniari. I love you, young Mare?. - I'll take it... - Grushenka, Ana Olari. - Liza, the little Liza... - If she's naked, I'll do it too. - A first-year student. - A picture? - Lidia Mocanu. - We know each other. She has a college exam and she couldn't come. And now, the big surprise, Aliosha Karamazov... Also me... Andrei Avram. - He came from a provincial theater... - Is he from the brigade? - Amateur? - He's a collaborator on the show for now. - Call him here. - Andrei, come, please. Come, dear. - Get a text. - Come here. - Please. - Let everyone see you. Good luck, young man, good luck! One moment, please. Comrade Vișan, who couldn't come today, invites you to a glass of sparkling wine. Original. Uncle George? With a wife, a child and glory, you are a happy man. My love, if you came to say I'm happy, it means the happiness has already gone. So, happiness doesn't exist. Happiness? A toast to our casting, and I have no doubt about our success. Our stake is the very soul of mankind. Karamazov asks some fundamental questions about man's relationship with God and with himself. Expect your very soul to be tested. And Dostoevsky shows us a way, we must find the strength to follow it. Cheers! - How not to love theater? - For happiness. Did you see, Uncle George? And what was the biggest role you have had so far? As a number of lines? No, as importance. - Depends on what's important to you. - To me? I don't know, like to get applause before the final gong. You tell, Fainar. Important is what Diana Cantuniari says it is. That's the first rule in a women's theater. Young man, don't lose your enthusiasm, that's how she is, a bitch, when she feels threatened, or when she's looking for a threat. Yes, I understand that no one has a reason to trust me, yet. Trust? Good one. You'll need a lot of confidence in the coming months. Hi! I'm here. Andrei Avram. Auditions for "Trigorin" Hi! Young and talented. I... how should I put it? You're talking about celebrity, happiness, an interesting and bright life. But for me, forgive me, all these beautiful words are like a gem I never taste. You are very... To the hall, dear, there's the audience. You're very young and very kind, many times you're ruled by persistent thoughts, day and night you only think about the moon, for example. I have my own moon. - Is he from Piatra Neamt? - He's from the countryside. For sure, my friends did not treat me like... I will start over. Yes, it's enough. You were late and you forgot some of the lines on the way. - But I can do more, I feel that I can. - And very full of himself. Thank you. But I was good... Good evening! Good evening! He was late at the theatre, he is late at the party. At least he's consistent. Come in! - Hi, Andrei Avram. - Anda, nice to meet you. - How's the leg? - Healed. - Your Trigorin was excellent. - Thanks. I'd be happy if you told me you saw others crappier than me, while you were in the back, in the wing. I know when somebody is good, because I stop painting. Your audition was really good, they commented. And you happened to be there? - No. - Why then? - Are you an actress? - No, never. I am attracted to costumes, stage design, I want to discover the world, the actors, how they feel, live, how they manage... Santa Clause, you ended up here? Andrei, my daughter, Oana. -Hi again! -Hi. -What a surprise. -This is what he said when I was born. That was all I was able to utter. Come eat something. Come on. Come, sweetheart. You know that... your passport has been approved. Buy a bouquet of flowers. Please, please. -Good morning, maestro! -Good morning, young man! -Hello! -Hello! Let's start! Andrei, your first line, scene 1, with George. We skip the part before the... Let's go, start! I came to ask for your blessing. - I want to join an abbey... - Andrei, Andrei, sit down! Look, if George were nervous, maybe I would be upset. But in your case, there is no problem, come on! He's the one to talk about emotions, look at his face. Come on! I came to ask for your blessing... I came to ask for your blessing. I want to join an abbey, especially since I was accepted by the monks to start the novitiate. Andrei, it's very good. George, I want to see in you the cunning of an old, womanizer, alcoholic satyr. We had a commemoration for my mom. I know Father Zosima made a deep impression on you, so my boy wants to become a monk? Is this what your precious soul wants? Well, well, I have nothing to say. So you're going to go down the church road, huh? At my mother's grave. At my mother's grave I felt this is I wanted to do with all my heart... You are so much your crazy mother! It's great you are so much like her, to be honest, I feel sorry for you, Alyosha. I feel so sorry, I don't know if you will believe me, but you got under my skin, my good boy. But at least there you will have the chance to pray for us, sinners, because we messed around too much. It's not possible, I say, that after I kick the bucket, not to... Good, good, that's it... And now some laughter... - In their kingdom, until... - Some laughter. - Leave me alone, for a minute, please... - George! And then I ask you: where do they get their pitchforks from? Are there such factories in the afterlife? And then I say to you, if pitchforks don't exist, they should be invented for your bastard father, otherwise how will there be any justice? There are no pitchforks! How do you know they don't exist? At the monastery, you will see, you will change your mind. My good little boy... My angel. My angel from heaven. Andrushenka, look at me for a second, please, with your angel eyes. I am not going to act looking at the walls, like in a butt. I'm sorry, but I looked everywhere. I found only of 50 and this on of 2000. What was I supposed to do? I brought this one and... Well done, this is how you save energy. I'll point it towards the ceiling, is it OK? To hell with it! On top of that it gives off heat. -What are the girls doing? -I'm going shopping. My dear, your protégé is a little modest. Be patient. I am not good at being patient, but I can brag about other things. I see that you are blushing, are you sick of so much filth. It's too much for you, right? I didn't blush because you talk like that, nor for your deeds, but because I realize that I am like you. You? Get out of here! That would be too much. Too and not quite. We both go up the same ladder. - I am on the lowest step, you... - A little higher. You, a little higher. But when you set your foot on the first step no matter what you do, you can't climb them all. - Is it OK? - It's very good. Go on, continue! Hello, an ice cream, please. Ice-cream. Thank you! Tell me if you want something other than taking shelter here. - First, throw the ice cream. - Yes. And close the door. -Hello. -Hello. I am looking for Brothers Karamazov. Let's assume you've found them. What do you do? I want to become an actor. So you are not, and you want to become. I don't even know. And you want to play Alyosha. I am thinking. Don't complain, Alyosha. Are you following me? I didn't think. Maybe. It was a joke. You two know each other? Sure, he is Santa Clause at night, and during the day he's preparing for acting. Isn't it right? I have bad news for you. We only have volume two and six of the Complete Works. But we also have good news. All the Karamazovs are in volume two. Mister Bendiman? Nothing new for my mom? I'll call mommy later. Young man, the Bolsheviks banned Dostoyevsky for years. They were afraid that his virus about faith will spread everywhere. He was at the same level as Dante, Shakespeare, the golden generation of literature. Horrible. And at some point you take one here. Like this? And then you can... like that. And you lay down on... exactly... ok. Come on, up and... You will help us, right? You see... in the 18th century, an old man with bad old habits declared that... if God didn't exist, then He should be invented. And it is true. It is like that, that's what they say. Man created God. As far as I'm concerned, I stopped a long time ago thinking about whether man created God or God created the man. I'm not saying I don't accept God, do understand me well, I'm saying that I don't accept the world created by Him. Can you tell me why you don't accept this world? Yes! I will tell you a funny story, so you can understand me better. Funny... From the time of a Bulgarian rebellion against the Turks. - Imagine a little child... - How nice, so nice! - Imagine a child. - A child. - In his mother's arms. - And you know the story. - She's stunned with fear. - Come on, go on! In the midst of Turkish soldiers who barged in on them at home. What do you think they decided to do? All of them were rushing to pet the child. And they were making faces, and monkeying. And they stuck out their tongues. You can do it towards him. - And they stuck out their tongues. - And they were monkeying around. - And they were making faces. - Nice, ballet style. Trying to make him laugh. And they succeeded in the end. You cover your ears, you don't want to hear. And the child burst into laughter. - Because you know the story. - Then, one of the soldiers... - Takes out the gun. - Takes out the gun. - Like it is a flower, takes out the gun. - Takes out the gun. And, and... - Points it at the child's head... - At the child's head... - One palm away... - No, but it is nice, it is nice. I mean the child likes it. The child says: "wow"! And the child reaches out. And everybody smiles, and yet the story is beautiful, and he shoots the child, the child is blown to pieces, the guts of the child all over his face, and they raped the mother... This is why you have to start from the beginning in a nice way. There was an old pander from the 18th century and he said God doesn't exist. Maybe it is true. Maybe it is true but I don't care. I only care that the world is evil. And you don't yell it, you say it by showing how much it costs you. The world is evil! We'll do it tomorrow. But I have doubts. I am starting to doubt that I can play this role. You are scared! There are actors who think that if they know the text and recite it, they've played their part. But you want more. Why should you be scared? Because... I feel it's too far from me. You feel shit, I apologize... It's been a while, let's see what's happening with him. Leave him, he doesn't like to be looked after. One last round, please, with plenty of water and the check. It was a pleasant dinner, gentlemen. Thank you. We thank you. We breathe. Maestro, maybe you should quit drinking. Yes. As time goes by, people become better. Or bitter. They turn to bitter. Andrei, my boy... We all have our sins. But that doesn't make us devils. Do you get it? Allow yourself to be good. Maestro, at what number? Here. - 23, take 14. - And action! You, idiot, how can you let all of this happen? - The regulation, comrade... - Forget about the regulation! - You are right, Comrade Major, sir. - Stop! What are you doing? Are you asleep? The camera is rolling, don't stop! - Forgive me, I am sorry. - Go on! I should've take advantage and hit you harder. When do you have the exam for film? I will postpone it. I will have a failed exam. The first one. Anyway, I'm going with my mom to Austria. Will I ever see you again? Get this crap out of your mind. I'm just going on vacation, that's all. Have you ever been abroad? - No. - No? What do you want me to bring you back from there? If you're really coming back... Yes... ...a bag of real coffee. - Is it much? - No. Keep this until I get back. Do you want to? Andrei... It may sound stupid... but I say it anyway. I think I fell in love with you. If we want to share the joy of the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, we have to share His suffering, His sacrifice on the cross. May the Lord be with you! Father Necolau, good morning! God bless you. I've told you about my husband, Andrei. He has some amends to make, just to say when. - You know, his father is a priest. - Yes? Parish priest? Dumitru Avram had a small parish at the mountain, which burned. Yes, I think I've heard something about it. Andrei, stay a little with the father. So, I suppose your father was the family's confessor... The first step of the ladder. Which ladder? On our journey to heaven, we'll learn to make amends on every step we climb up. And so, we'll be free from sins in front of God. Yes, I vaguely remember what my father said. But I still don't know what to do. Pray that the birth of your baby to be a blessing. And if you need to talk to someone... Yes, Father. Dear mother, I have a lot of questions which I would like to ask you about dad. In the next 18 months of compulsory army service you will eat, you will sleep and you're going to shit only when I say so. Attention! Actually, about the life of a priest. About temptation, about lying... hatred... Did you receive a letter? No, it's an older one, from my father in America. Attention! I'll be back in five minutes and I'll fuck you up. Fuck your mothers' ass! Avram! You schlub, you're dealing in my house. I'll finish you! Down, crawl! You're a piece of shit, Avram. You have no direction, you have no conscience! When God made you, He was so busy that forgot to give you that thing called discipline. Attention! Down! Crawl! Stand up! Down! Stand up! Crawl, crawl! Come on! And many other questions which would help me understand Aliosha. Please send this letter. -Hello, maestro! -Yeah! Did Valeriu Condiescu come? He's just arrived. But he was a little tired. - And, where is he? - He went upstairs. - Good morning, maestro! - Good morning! What are you doing? Applause counting? Yes. Come up here. I kept thinking about yesterday's rehearsal with Dimitri and I have an idea. You keep complaining about Aliosha. I thought I'd give you another role. Such a sadness gets me, when I see you so troubled. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I'm definitely losing my mind. You are just an illusion, a phantasmagoria, a sick man's hallucination. I'm the devil, and nothing human is foreign to me. The emotions are gone. I've learned from you to indulge in all kinds of pleasures. For example... I like going to the Turkish bath and bathe with the merchants. And the priests. Especially the priests. A miracle. Another pleasure, perhaps the greatest, when the ugliness embraces me, is to listen to the confessions. I have to tell you one. A few days ago, a wonderful girl, with a lusting body and grace has come to confess to her spiritual elder. She kneeled, confessed, and then what do you think happened? The old man fell into temptation and he asked her for a date on that evening. What do you think? Nature was stronger than his religion. Let's move on... The scene with the stair. Text. Andrei? - Andrei? - Yes? - Call the ambulance, I'm feeling sick. - Now. - Andrei! - Now, now! - Neighbor, Anda is giving birth. - I wish it health! We have to go to the hospital. I've tried calling the ambulance, a cab, no one is answering. I can't, is already Sunday, I have even numbers. It's illegal, they take your license for that. I'll talk to the General if necessary. - Neighbor, I forget about the debt. - Just a minute, I'll go change... - Come on, go, go. Leave the brandy! - Just a minute. - Come on! - There he comes! Fix the fucking roads! - It oinked a lot this year, neighbor. - Who hiccupped? The pig I mean. It squealed a lot this year. There will be a big drought. - Yo, ugly face! What are you doing? - Come on, come on, go faster. Look at him... We have an emergency. You must be patient, they cut the power. We bring the headlights from the car. She's giving birth! You asshole, she's giving birth! - There you go! We have light. - Go to hell! It weighs 6.6 pounds and it's a boy, doctor! Music! - Good evening. - Good evening. - My wife. - The wife. Hello, ma'am! - My wife. - Mrs. Iordache. - My wife. - Mrs. Iordache. Stefan. - Hello, neighbor. - Hello, what is this? - Costache? - Rehearsals for the birth of the Lord. Thomas Avram's show. Son of Andrei and Anda. The premiere will take place in the building with steeples behind me. It's the church. It's our church, here. Today, instead of the audience in the hall the angels of the Lord will be invited. Don't worry, please, don't worry, we're not going to hear Toma's snoring anyway. - Andrei, what's in there? - A room without a tenant. The guy was arrested by the communists. A man in prison working at the canal. A sad moment. Sorry, I have to leave, I'll get a call from abroad. Bye. Andrei, I'll make you a drink that you have not drunk before. Cognac spritz. I will be right back. How long is it taking? It's late. And the little one is restless. All are happy for us. At least come say good night to them. Anyway, everyone's drunk. They will not remember anything tomorrow. - And there's a lot of smoke. - ...but they are connoisseurs of wine. When the dance starts, do you call me? See? That's the right attitude. Cheers! Cognac spritz for everybody. So, how are you? Are you still afraid of the role? I have to tell you something. Honestly. That's it, a moment of sincerity. Less often in our theater. You are right. Now I'm reading for the first time "The Karamazov brothers", the novel. And an incredible fear overwhelmed me. Wait. Did you read anything from Dostoevsky? - No. - Perfect! An advice. Don't read anything. Well, you didn't hear what happened to Silviu Bălan's boy? The books of Feodor destroyed him. One day, our boy, filled a large bag with the complete works of Dostoevsky, left his home, and since then, he sleeps wherever he finds, he goes through pubs reading from Dostoevsky and begging for a glass of vodka. What disease from reading books. Some clearly remain stupid. - It's Mares. - Mares. Valeriu Condiescu is dead. Tighten it firmly in the corner. - Did they bring him, Mr. Bebe? - They brought him, he's inside. God bless him. You don't hold a baby like that, darling. Let me show you. Quiet! How do you want me to sleep if we can't make him be quiet? - Let me help you. - No, be quiet... And you're going to say again that I drank... - That the line, isn't it? - Yes, that's it. And you're going to say again that I drank, but it's not true. Because I don't drink! I enjoy myself. Wasn't a chair here? - It was a chair here. - It's backstage. Come on, move. You are an angel, Alioșa. You are the angel of the earth, my dear little brother. I did great misdoings. I touched righteous girls with all my lusts, I bathed like a pig in this mire, pushed by the worm coddled in my soul. - I'm cursed. - I know the text. I bathed like a pig in all this mess, pushed by the worm coddled in my soul. I'm cursed, Alioșa. A degenerate, that's what I am. I'm a poisonous animal, but you know something, Alioșa? I'm not such a dishonest man. - I have my own God. - With laughter, a lot, bigger, come on. You support him with laughter all the way. I see you blushed, Alioșa. You loathe it, aren't you? You're tired of too much filth. It's too much for you, isn't it? I've blushed because I'm like you. You? Get out of here, how can you be like me? We both climb the same ladder. I'm on the lowest step, you, a little higher. - When you set foot... - Even if you put your foot on the step. Even if I say this to him, that now ... Even if you have your foot on the step, you don't have time to get to the top. Even if you have your foot on the step, you don't have time to get to the top. Well then, let's not set foot on the step, Alioșa. Who can do that? But can you? - I am afraid not. - Shut up, Alioșa. Shut up, my little brother, shut up! Grusenca. The whore. Grusenca, the whore, who tells me that she knows people, do you know what she told me a few days ago? That one day she will eat you in one gulp, do you understand? In one gulp, Alioșa. - Okay, that's it. - Man, that's it... Man... He started to... - Sorry, I messed up. - You blushed. What can we do? The bell from the stage... Comrades, bad news never come alone. Kamarazov was canceled. Canceled ... was not approved. Next week we will look for some Romanians, we must have a premiere. Mr. Avram, pass me by. His death gave them the perfect excuse. Mr. Visan, you should know that these guys would've never allowed the play to be premiered. You can be sure of that. That wasn't nice, children. I have two pieces of news for you. We don't have only bad news. Starting tomorrow you will be our colleague officially and I also managed to get you a Bucharest ID. Another problem would be that tomorrow at 12 o'clock, you have to appear on television to recite a New Year's poem. The whole country will watch you, and the president too. I can't, actually I don't know how to recite, I didn't learn how to. I understand. I knew you were a toad. Get out! Comrade Andrei, Mr. Valeriu left this envelope with his bonus for you. Thank you. Hello, the actor is not available due to a death in his family. We will find someone else. Yes. What are you waiting to buy? Medicinal cotton wool for the ladies. I'm cold, it's terribly cold, freezing cold. It's almost midnight. At night, the king is awake, he drinks, feasts, he stumbles... - Hey! What are you doing here? - Leave him alone. I'm selling, comrade, I'm selling poetry. I pay for the stand too. At night, the king is awake, he drinks, feasts, he stumbles, he dances like a maniac and when he drinks... -Hey! Are you insane? -No, comrade, I recovered. And when he drinks another glass of wine the drums start rolling, the orchestra busts... Darling, you have a letter. Thank you. - I got some milk. - So nice of you. MINISTRY OF INTERIOR BUCHAREST MUNICIPALITY MILITIA -Have some 'cause it's good. -Look in the mirror, Andrei, is that you? Andrei, you still have time to save yourself, you have talent. You already have what others wish for. You have a family, a healthy body. Okay, it's not like you treat it as you should. You have scars on your face now, your trousers are filthy. Andrei, who are you fighting with? Andrei? Andrei! You're a father now, we're three and we're healthy. You've always been a wild horse, tough, you always had to find your path on your own, I understand, but you should also understand that the play has been cancelled, theaters have cut the wages in half, your famous artists are now making a living out of radio and television, please understand. You read Dostoevsky, but in vain. You have no fear of God. You live only for the applauses and your dreams and... Every time I sit down and start drawing, making a model, why do you think I make it? I want to earn something to raise my child, Andrei. Anda, please. Stop it, I don't want to listen anymore to your nonsense. Every night you come home dead, you lost your mind. Once you were coming smelling of perfume, but now... you have scars on your face. It's insane! Andrei, we have a child to raise together. Nothing really matters to you anymore? Absolutely nothing? Just liquor and theater? You have those. -A great man. -God rest his soul! We have Russian vodka, straight from its mother land. A bottle? If you have two, actually four, and I will pay you on the 20th, when I get paid. - Yes, I have. - Okay. To your boy! You're clearly going down. I don't want to comfort you, but in comparison with what's happening right now at the television, the cancellation of the Karamazovs is no big deal. I got a directive that was saying: don't lie to your kids about Santa Claus, replace him with the atheist Father Frost and make the orthodox Christmas disappear. This is what Ceausescu said. We start filming the holiday programs in August. Now we have to remove Santa Clause completely. Outside it's snowing, it's crazy. An imbecile is ruling an imbecile people. We deserve it because we're not doing anything about it. - Here, your present from Oana. - From Oana? Yes. - You knew that they would stay? - Yes, of course. - Costache, I'm sorry for... - It doesn't matter anymore, I'm glad. One can no longer live in this shit anyway. I'm out of here at the first opportunity. - I'll leave at any price. - God may help you. The milk, you called, the shift is leaving. Let's wait. The Kremlin starts working, the last act is on. Drop curtain. Thank you. You know that they are not allowed to leave the embassy, right? If they want to eat they are taken by bus, if they want a woman, they go to the bathroom... It's like they are paid to stay in prison. Thank you, comrade. Cuckoo! Have you been drinking again? - What's this? - Butter. - Butter and? - And what? -Baby formula, for Toma. -You quitted your job, or what? No, I robbed a cow on my way home. Are these sketches yours? Yes. From the play that we are putting together. Cool. Everything you touch comes to life. You will soon make it to Bucharest, and you will become famous. Sure, I will go to Bucharest, but I don't want fame. I want a family. How many children do you want? I don't know what kind of father I will be. Be more confident, more punctual, learn to forgive... Yes, I already am more confident. - Bagels with salt and hole. - Be careful in that big city. This is my aunt Muti's number, in Bucharest, we will stay at her place at first. Puiu's pen. I will pray for you. For both of you. - Move a little bit, Muta. - I'm cold, come on! - That's it, Iordache, good. - It's gonna take long? Okay. - Show Toma. - He's laughing. That's it. Just a minute. What are you doing? I know you can't resist me. C'mon, Toma, bring your mother closer to Santa. - Merry Christmas, my love. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, my little one. - Look! Who's asleep? If you want, we keep the belly. It's perfect like this. Santa's elves. - Merry Christmas! - C'mon, neighbor! Cheers, cheers! This is from my father-in-law. Cheers, let's take a photo. C'mon children, start singing! The star is rising up, as a great mystery The star shines and brings the great news. Best wishes! Happy New Year! On the occasion of the New Year, comrade Nicolae Ceausescu has spoken, secretary general of the Romanian Communist Party the president of the Socialist Republic of Romania. Thank you. Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Cheers! - Happy New Year! - Happy New Year! I had a dream in which seeing you so sad, I understood your silence. And I turned off the sky's splendor for you to rest, and then you forgot, but I didn't leave you in darkness, I left a lot of stars to provide you light. Now all that's left... is just to love you and hope that at least today... Hello? Happy New Year, my love! I had a dream in which... Hello? Hello? Mr. Beldiman? Mr. Beldiman? Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Finally you're here! I'm freezing and I'm bored. Didn't your wife tell you? I called you around holidays. A lot happened. I have something for you. I've kept them for you for a while. Dostoevsky, I had owed you. Mr. Beldinam, you're a magician! And this is your Christmas present. Mr. Beldiman... ...and divinity, my dear. I'm speechless. -Wonderful. -Well... And forever and ever, amen. Toma was such... a good boy. Thank you, mother. -Andrei, what's wrong? -You shouldn't have given it to me. - Your father will... - My father is dead. Mom, he left only once and when he left he went to God. I tried to use it. Dad dulled the pen's nib. And later on I realized why the writing was so untidy in the letters that I received. Carved. Keep it! You keep it safe! What happened to him actually? What happened to him? He kept saying that our freedom is more important than his problems. He was too good. Actually, the security took him. Along with many others. Sir, I brought him. Come in! Comrade Avram, nice to meet you. Come in, make yourself comfortable! Please excuse us, we are very crowded here. -You know why I called you, right? -No, I don't. Honestly, I was really surprised. I've never been to the Militia. You've never been to the Militia? Good for you! Sit there. Where is the file? This is it? How are you, you little? Don't keep them any longer, let them go, okay? Comrade Avram, I will be honest with you, I hope that will help us. I stumbled upon some... punks, who have a business with art pieces. You know Oana Condiescu, the film director, don't you? -So you know her. -Yes, I met her. Professionally. I played in one of her movies in college. And that's all. And during filming, did you happen to... see him there, or maybe make his acquaintance? This guy. No. No. Don't hurry, we have enough time. Look! I'm sure I didn't meet him. He works in television. And he's filming. You're an actor, right? Yes, no. No, I have never seen him before. Yes, I'm an actor. Although I haven't played in a while. And that night when you went to the young film director's home, and you left the following morning, it was because of the filming, right? Did you happen to see in her house... some similar paintings? No. Are you sure? I'm sure. I didn't see them. Look again. No. None of them. These bastards... Andrei, I love you. -Do you think you can make me a favor? -Anything, anytime. Can you leave me your key under the door mat? - Go. - Go on. And he tried to... -Comrade, where are you going? -Home. What's the matter? Go another way, here is forbidden. C'mon! Andrei, what are you doing here? Go! June 19, 1987 Forgive them, God! They don't know what they are doing. Attention, halt! It's forbidden! I can't. Try again. We have time. I can't, and that's it. Breathe, son. You can do it. Then scream out loud: I'm Andrei Avram and I can't ski. -I'm Andrei Avram and I can't ski! -Louder! -I'm Andrei Avram and I can't ski! -Louder! -I'm Andrei Avram and I can ski! -That's it! -I'm Andrei Avram and I can ski! -Then go ahead! It worked. Andrei, stop! Wait for me here! The church is falling! -My little one! -Good day! - I'm glad you came. - Me too. Go wash your hands, okay? We are going to eat. Come with grandpa. Let's go in the yard. What's the matter with you? They took Puiu. I was afraid to tell you on the phone. But they came from the security and they took him. Oh, my God... Good thing Andrei didn't wake up. I want to leave him here with you and go to Bucharest because I want to know more. And who can say something? I don't know. - Why did the cucumber cross the street? - Why? 'Cause it was green. Cătălin! Who's the sucker? We should go. Sparky's Catalin. Pissant. Who's the boulder? He is the signalman's grandson. What's your name, shit-bag? Andrei. Avram. Shit-bag is my middle name. - Look at these guys! - Dude, these are our rails. If you want to use them, you have to face up the train. Got it? Now, you redneck, let's go, it's coming! - Shitheads, whoever jumps is a coward! - Don't be afraid, Catalin, I'm with you. - Shit-bag, I was kidding! - Andrei! Run! Gotcha! Wake up, guys! Wake up! Wake up, guys! Wake up! Wake up, guys! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, guys! Wake up, guys, come on! What are you doing here? - Andrei, what a surprise! - Hi, Tudor. He's Avram from my movie. Are you coming in? Hello. No. I wanted to ask you something. Sure. You have to help me. I want to work, extra, anything, just to... Can you help me? I think Constantin is starting something. - Let me talk to him. - Perfect, thanks. - See you, cheers! - Yeah. Good luck. - Comrade Caranica. - Present. - Comrade Delimace. - Present. - Comrade Sterie Ciumete. - Present. Comrades, by the brilliant victory from the 6th of September the legionary movement took a determined step on the Captain's path. For us, the engagement with death does not scare us. For the sacrifice of every legionary ensures the complete victory of the movement. The dead look at us and judge us. Their blood sacrifice demands sacrifice! Wound by wound, pain by pain, torment by torment, grave by the grave, that's how we won so far, that's how we'll win. A brave character is brave, Andrei. I mean, let's not beat around the bush, you are full of talent, and the way you portrayed Sima is... For train tracks which remained parallel. What a memory you have, Cătălin. I was terribly scared between the rails. And I was too, for you. This crap is the Corăbioara. - Waiter? - Yes? - What vodka is this? - Viborova. This is Corabioara, you fraud. Don't you know what you're drinking? You vagrants, you assholes... - Dude, are you lying to my face? - Calm down, please. It's probably an error from the bar. Calm down please! You will receive a discount. Take that too! Thieves! Viborova. Asshole! Andrei? It is a great success, a perfect acting achievement. But we don't want to annoy those at the ministry if we give him a prize. I understand, but it's a great injustice. Let's give an ex equo prize. Excluded. I accept. It is a great injustice. But we award the acting prize to an actor, not to a character. I once said: out of the question. I can't accept that. I can't accept. Good evening. Goodbye. So, it's settled then, sign. Sign below also. What else did Dad bring to Toma? Cartoons and a lab rat for study. Are you right in the head, Andrei? At your age? You spend money on unnecessary crap. All we needed was a lab rat! I don't want my kid to grow up just watching Bulgarian cartoons. Did you hear them mangle the language on the street? Better watching Bulgarian cartoons than dead, after the ceiling will fall over our head. If you took me as your wife please take care of this house, too. Enough already, let's go! Daddy! Sorry to disturb you, I'd like to talk to Costache Vorvoreanu, please. - Excuse me but who's asking? - Andrei Avram. I'm at the front entrance of the television building. - Wait for me at the bus station. - Okay. - Young man, you want this? - What? - It's for sale. - No. - Hello, Mr. Avram. - Hello, Andrei. Costache has not come to work for some time now. I couldn't tell you that on the phone. I heard he was caught crossing the border. I found this under his desk. I don't know what to do with it. Thank you, bye. DEPARTMENT OF MASS CULTURE You recognize it, I'm sure. It's fine. I know you help the Jews by selling their valuable things. I also know that the money they get secures them a passport to leave the country. I know you too little. What can I say... We live hard times. And dangerous. Costache Vorvoreanu was arrested. You should clean your yard. I assume the bastards may come to ask you questions. ...in Timisoara... They shoot the people who took to the streets, to ask for bread and freedom. Listen: Timisoara, the 17th of December 1989. Anda, Muta! Anda! She's sleeping. They started to shoot in Timisoara. There are dead, wounded. - Where's Anda? - She is queuing to buy meat. But where did you come up with this one? Free Europe broke the news. I heard screams, machine guns, women, children. I don't know. This is the Russians' doing, they light the wick. Gorbachev's little hands. Hello? Yes, he's sleeping. No, leave it. Come on, come home! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ceausescu is no more! Anda! Anda! Come here! Ceausescu flew away. - The killer left us! - Down with Securitatea! We're free! Down, down, down, down! - Freedom! - Freedom! The tyrant has fallen! Victory! Down with Ceausescu! Down with communism! We won! Are you're taking pictures of me? What is this, a wedding? Fuck you! Move! Water, give us water! You want water? Here, water with shit I give you! At the University there was a massacre, they came in with tanks, they killed people. In the morning they wiped the dried blood with the hose. Freedom Freedom! Ceausescu ran away! Yes! Freedom! Yes! Freedom! Look at this. I was so afraid for you. What happened? I'm happy. Nothing serious, I fell while queuing for milk. There's madness in the city. Yes, I watched it, they broadcast on TV the news non-stop. What are we doing? Drawing? No, I'm fine. Iliescu, the former communist leader, speaks when taking the power What are you doing, my general? I was too excited. - Slowly. - Slowly, slowly. - What happened to you? - Nothing. I couldn't stay and do nothing, isn't it? - Look, Iliescu is talking again. - Yes. Those who have led us until now have defiled the Communist Party Let's hope better ones come. We won't get rid of them soon. If he will lead us... This one comes from the communist school. They are good, they smile, they promise. But they remain hidden behind their children and their children children. Understand? Andrei, is your mother on the phone. Tell her I'm taking a shower, ask her what she wants. They found Cătălin's body. The bastards killed him. No! No! Damn political police! You do whatever you want! But not this time! If you don't bring a helicopter to take us out of here, we will die with these children. God calls us together because we are as innocent as they are. You oxen! Surrender, you idiots! Surrender, put your weapons down! Hands on the back of your head! Get down one by one. Soldiers! Don't shoot! - Don't shoot! - Get down ! Get down, you idiot! 1990, University Square, Bucharest THE FIRST AREA FREE OF COMMUNISM Down with communism! Here, in University Square, there would be a gang, every day the same people... Our mission is to fight, to oppose... The Government's decision to refuse dialogue with demonstrators, with representatives of the signers of the Proclamation. Congratulations! I went to the premiere last night. I was impressed by the bus scene. Is it true that it did not exist in the novel? Pintilie introduced it. But it's true. It happened, I mean it, also in Timisoara, in '85. I hope it will be better for us from now on. You should be there, in the balcony. People will listen to you. Freedom, we love you, either we win, or we die! - What is this, Mr. Bebe? - How should I know? God knows. Some bastards, but not from our theater. It was peace and discipline under the Comrade rule. - Good morning! - Good morning! - Good morning, my friend! - Hello. Please, listen to me. I don't have much time, I have to run to the ministry, but I still have a few corrections to Karamazov and we start the rehearsal again. Perfect. I need you peaceful, clear minded... Give up University Square. They have the majority, they have everything. You saw that downstairs. That's their answer. So that's it? Dear God! You too? You have nothing to say? It would be a useless war anyway, we have to be patient. Patience? But the ease with which you accepted theater management? Does that make sense? And you will run it a long time. And that makes sense. - They closed your mouth too easy. - How can you say it? I brought you to this theater, I pulled you out of that dead end where you would have rotted. Shame on you. Sha... To me?! Dan, you run a theater, not a prison. For the first time in my life I feel free. And I will stay that way. Down Iliescu! Down Iliescu! In this square, the courage of some children brought Ceausescu to his knees. To them, to be betrothed with death it did not frighten them. But their sacrifice was in vain. Power has been taken in the offices of the palaces. We are here to say it bluntly, "Down with communism"! Down with communism! The dead look at us and judge us. Their sacrifice demands another sacrifice. We will not leave here. We will go all the way! Listen, you know what to do. Buy a brooch or a finer perfume, of quality, but not to be expensive because... Okay... Look here! Look, he is the asshole. Yes? Dude, I told you when... Okay, come on... Yes. Listen... Iliescu has flair. He's unbeatable. There's a bunch of legionnaires all right. I wonder who pays them. - Whores, whores and drug addicts. - That's right, boss. Yes! No! We need a strong article, I'll give you the whole first page. Put the photo of the asshole on the whole page. To give out. A short text, down, something, but to be clear. Something like the "Redivivus Legion", or better, directly, "Legionnaires want to take the power." Please write what you want, but that remains. "The Legionnaires want to take the power." Okay, come on, dismissed. Tavi, my man, if it goes well, you have an extra point. - Yes, sir. - You got married? No. Good. It's better that you didn't get married. You will no longer bring that stupid one, to pay her in vain. Dear miners, I thank you for your prompt response. Anda? Anda! - Yes. What happened? - Did you hear what happened? We must remain vigilant. We will go to the National Televison to address the people. Muta, why do you speak French? Speak in Romanian because I don't understand anything. I've always talked like this. This is my mother tongue. This time we are dealing with fascists... Muta, what's wrong with you? George sent me a ticket. Bucharest - Paris, and then New York. Down with the fascists These are miners. Down with the fascists What are you doing with the knife? Do you want to kill me? I think we need a doctor. We must establish a true democracy... Yes, a taxi! ...for the people Right now, these elements are trying to undermine our democracy. The Army must offer stability.... ...and defend the achievements of the people. It must not stand idle... when vandals commit such barbarous acts against the people. We work, we do not think! We work, we do not think! Inform the president that we will set fire to the buses. That was the deal. Welcome! Thank you! 0-1. Enter the building! Get down! They are paid with counterfeit dollars. Take the rats out, save us from the wretched! Open the door! Has 0-1 entered the building? This way, guys! Go to the balcony. He is dressed in white. Beat him to a pulp! Mirel, he is the legionary! It's that you? Alive or dead? I give you a fine. You have to tell me what you're looking for in the neighbor's yard. You disturbe the public peace. Good job! I saw him fly. Get him in the car! You're an idiot, aren't you? Did you do 9 x-rays on one lung? Nine? Idiot! Were you asked to kill him? Say it! So said the comrade who brought him. Nine x... Nine x-rays, you idiot! What should I do? He asks about you. Toma is waiting for you. Andrei! Yes? In the name of the Father, now and forever and ever. Amen. Am I alive? Approximate. Who brought you? I am confused. Something is happening. I do not understand... I think I lost... They hit me hard in the head, they hit my body, and I forgave them because I've lost my mind. Father, I hear a voice... Mine, but not in the ears, somewhere in the body, in the heart. He knows. After 9 months - Muta is gone. - What? Muta is dead. Who is there? Look. Toma? Come up! They called you again from the theatre. At least give them a sign. Anda, the truth is, his recovery it's really miraculous. - Tests show that... - May I? Yes, of course. You have a post-traumatic hearing loss, because of the perforation of the eardrum. That means you won't hear for a long time with your right ear. Maybe a miracle. Are you sleeping better now? - Much better. - Good. Miraculous. What sadness surrounds me when I see you so upset. You are an illusion, a phantasmagoria, a hallucination of a sick man. I think I'm crazy. My dear, you're not crazy. The devil I am, and nothing human is foreign to me. Right away. Mr. Andrei, you have a package from the gate. Thanks. What do you want? Nature was stronger than his faith. It is not easy to destroy thousands of beings, for one to be saved. What is the reward? To face the curses of the people! Alioșa, what's wrong with you? What upsets you? The death of Abbot Zosima? Leave me alone! You started to get angry like an ordinary mortal? You, angel? And all this because the old abbot began to smell like a dead man. Did you really think he was holy? That he doesn't stink anymore? I believed and I believe because I want to believe. You're angry. You got angry at the good God. You start to fight Him. You are rebelling. I am not rebelling against God. I don't want to accept the world as He made it. That's all. I forgive everything, and everyone, I ask forgiveness from everything and from everyone, not only for my deeds, but for everything they did. Father, as you wished, I will leave the monastery. I'm going out into the world, to be with the people of the Lord. This film is dedicated to all showmakers In 1999, the actor chose to serve God. Nowadays, he's the abbot of a little monastery which bears the name of Saint Martyr Filimon who is considered the actors' guardian. 1977-1987 - "The Dark Decade" By the order of the dictator Ceausescu, 20 churches and monasteries were demolished in Bucharest, most of them being over 350 years old. 22 December, 1989, right after twelve o'clock, Ceausescu abandoned power and fled. It was the Revolution's climax, which made 5,203 victims. 1990 - Year ZERO. Today, after 30 years of investigation, the death toll of the miners' intervention ordered by Ion Iliescu remains unknown.
