Thanks for the ride. And just who are you trying to catch... under the mistletoe this year? White berries mean mistletoe, red berries mean holly. You of all people should know that! I thought I was picking you up at the airport tomorrow. I caught an earlier flight, so... I figured I'd surprise you. Oh, that's my kind of surprise, welcome home, Holly! Good to see you, Momma. I can't believe you're really here! I know, and for two full weeks this time. It's a Christmas miracle. What are you carrying in this thing? This cannot be good for your back, and take that jacket off. You're gonna cook in that down here. Okay, okay! I thought I'd get more of the tree decorated... before you got here. But I guess we'll just have to finish decorating it together. Sounds perfect. You must be hungry. I was just about to take lunch... over to the festival volunteers at Jones Park. You want to give me a hand? Yeah, of course. Got it all packed up in the kitchen. Sure you don't want to put this up, just in case? That should be the last of it. I can't believe you still have this pickup. Of course I do. It was your father's pride and joy. I thought I was his pride and joy. You were... he loved you just as much as he loved his truck. I cannot wait for you to see what they've done at the park. I'm excited. You're gonna love it. You ready? Yeah, let's do it. Okay. Hold on. You gotta be kidding me. Holly? Hey, Mr. McGuire! It's so good to see you! Well, your momma said you were comin' home for Christmas. She was real excited, talks about you nonstop. That does not surprise me. I think the mailman knows my shoe size. You bringing your famous fruit stand back this year? Festival wouldn't be the same without it. Yep, yep, it'll be there. Good. I just got my location assignment. Right next to your momma's stand. Is she here? Yeah. Hello, Caroline. Stuart. Just harvested a new crop of sweet potatoes at the farm. Put some aside for you. Aw... that's mighty kind of you. Well, I did have a selfish motivation. You promised me a slice... of the best sweet potato pie in the county. Well, then... a promise is a promise. What's up, Hollywood! Benny! Good to see you! Nice to have you back! We missed you 'round here! I missed you, babe. Hey, is that the brisket? I am so sorry, we've been working since 5:00 AM... and I'm starving. How long does it take to set everything up? Well, between the trees, the stands and the lights... I'd say about a couple of weeks. It's a massive set-up. Right outside, we got a bunch of little elves. Well, do you guys need some help? Oh, yes, we sure could use some help. I'll let the boss man know you offered. Mm-mm, oh, this is made with love. Later, Hollywood! Are my eyes deceiving me... or is that Holly Hart? Hi, Mike. I didn't know you were in town. I didn't tell you. It's been a long time. Did you miss me? Oh, I can't say that I have. You stayin' with your momma? Maybe. Is uh-- is her number still the same? Why would you need to call it? As soon as you ask me to. Hah, you're delusional. You still want to volunteer at the festival, right? Yeah. Oh, lucky you... I happen to be the project supervisor. How about I start you off tomorrow morning... 8:00 AM, bright and early? Sounds great. You know, they do say absence makes the heart grow fonder. You sure you didn't miss me a little bit? Let's give it a couple more years. Those boys sure do have an appetite, cleaned me right out. All set? You didn't tell me the festival was being run... by my ex-boyfriend. Did I forget to mention that? I know, he broke your heart. He didn't break my heart, he just-- But it would do you both a lot of good... if you can just try to mend fences while you're back. Give him a chance, maybe you'll see a new side of him. Hm? Let's go. - Smile. - I am smiling. No, you're squinting. Well, I'm blinded by your beauty... and slightly the sun. Perfect. Did you get my good side? They're all good. Let me see it. No! Let me see it. No! You'll shake it. No. You know what? Fine. I don't wanna see it. Oh... Merry Christmas. Well, I figured since you'd be joining me on campus soon... you should start dressing the part. Look, I know this distance hasn't been easy... but once we're in the same place... it'll be a whole new beginning for us. Do you like it? I love it. Here... hold it up. I want to take a picture. Yay! What size is this? Stop. I brought you some fresh blankets. Not that you'll need them. Next few nights are supposed to be some warm ones. Thanks, Momma. Oh, who's this? I found Rudolph here downtown. Hm, he's got a lot of miles on him. I bet he means a lot to someone out there. I know... I was gonna put a picture online... see if I could find his owner. In fact... here, strike a pose. One, two, three. All right, little guy... let's see if we can't get you home for Christmas. Merry Christmas to you, Uncle, and God save you! Bah humbug! Christmas a humbug? You can't mean that, I'm sure. I do mean it! What did I miss? Nothing, it just came back from commercial. You're good. Oh, good. No butter? It's for the tree. You're making me watch a movie and not eat popcorn? This one's for you. Thanks, Momma. You know, it's only the two of us for Christmas. It's okay if the tree doesn't have a popcorn string. It's tradition. Yeah, I know, I just thought you might want to take a break... from decorating and just relax and watch the movie. Holly, for me, decorating the house for Christmas... isn't a chore. It's something I look forward to. It is Christmas... like when I hang your stocking. I remember how you'd always sneak downstairs... while your father and I were asleep and open yours. Or when I make a wreath... takes me back to the time when my momma first taught me how. I cherish every moment. Good evening, sir. I bet it's really something when it's all lit up, huh? It is. People used to come from all over to see the show. Used to? Why did they stop? Hurricane... almost five years ago. There was a storm surge, and the entire town was underwater. This will be the first Winter Festival since then. Oh my. Huh... well, they appear to have made quite a recovery. Yeah. Marvelous little town. I've enjoyed my stay. Are you visiting your family for the holidays? No, just a bit of business. Oh, where are my manners? Alden Kriss. Holly. Holly! Wow. Aptly named for the holidays. Yeah, nice to meet you. I see you've met our Santa Claus. Mr. Kriss volunteered to be the man of the hour... during the light show. Well I wish I had known sooner, before I trimmed my beard. I think we have a fake one that came with your costume. Okay. Well, I'm looking forward to it, and nice to meet you. Very nice to meet you. Okay. Thanks, Mr. Kriss. I didn't think you were gonna show up. I keep my promises. Let's start next door. Lead the way. So, the town turned this place into municipal storage... a few years ago, we have everything... from Terror on the Coast at Halloween... sets and props for local theater. We did Shakespeare in the park this summer. We? Hamlet needed an understudy. And how exactly did you end up in charge of this festival? I work for the city now, events coordinator. Since when? About a year ago. You seem surprised. "It's a big world, Holly. I can't be tethered to one place." Are you quoting me now? Paraphrasing actually. Yeah, I thought so, I've ever used the word "tethered", ever. Okay, here we go. So, this is our staging area. It's where volunteers are working on lights... and props and signs. I kind of like to think of it as Santa's workshop. Does that make you an elf then? No, that makes me head elf. Wow, I don't remember this festival being quite this... big before. Well, it's the first one in five years... it's kind of like our grand return. The town upped the budget, and we're pretty lucky... we had a special benefactor chip in. Okay, so, should I just jump in, make myself useful? Actually, I have an assignment just for you. Okay... what is it? Nothing... yet, hopefully it's gonna be a concession stand. Your mom wants to use it for her baked goods. Ought to be a fun project for you. Give it the ole Hart touch. Oh, before I forget. Yep. Welcome to the team. Am I supposed to wear this? Or live inside of it? It was first come, first serve. Please tell me these aren't mandatory. You're a volunteer, you can wear it if you like. The other volunteers are wearing theirs, so... no pressure. Okay, here's your tool box-- I think I got it, wood, nails, I can handle it. Walking away. Good luck. Secure legs with screws, piece of cake. There should be another battery in the box. What? I was using the drill earlier, so the battery might be dead. But there should be an extra. Oh. Ah... thanks. Also... you want to use a wood screw. That one's for sheet metal. You can tell by the thread. Can I show you? Sure. Here. Thanks. How'd you get to be such an expert on this stuff? My dad taught me. He says that anything worth doing, is worth doing right. Wow, your dad sounds really smart. He's the best. Hey, Jack? I gotta go. Right here! Jack! I'm right here. What're you doing? Let's go, bud. Okay, which do you like better for the front door? I'd go candy cane. For the front door? I've always used solid red. Why did you ask me then? I just wanted your opinion. Hello? Holly! I bring tidings of good cheer and better news. You're in. Seriously? Officially, it's down to you and two others... but I've got the inside track that you're the favorite. But you didn't hear that from me. No, of course not. Sit tight. Final word won't come until after the New Year. But I thought you might appreciate the heads up. I do! Thank you so much! Merry Christmas. Bye. Good news? Very. I'm up for photo editor at this really big lifestyle magazine... in Los Angeles, so I'd have my own office... and a staff, and a door with my name on it. Oh, honey, that sounds wonderful. It is! I mean, there's really only just one downside... I, um-- I wouldn't be behind the camera anymore. And... you're okay with that? Well, I mean, I'd still working with photographs... it just wouldn't be mine. I don't know, it just seems like the next logical step to do... in my career, and a lot more money. Money isn't everything. Sure is nice, though. I remember when you were a little girl growing up... got your first camera. You just couldn't put it down. Well, I'm not a little girl anymore, Mom. Yeah, don't remind me. Love you, mom. There you are. Morning. I stopped by Triplett's, got you a little pick-me-up. I don't drink coffee. I know, that's why this is tea. Two sugars, right? Yeah... thanks. I know we didn't end things on the best of terms... and I'm partially-- entirely responsible for that. So I was hoping for a little truce? It's Christmas-time, Peace on Earth. Good will towards exes... Okay... truce. Truce. Hey... good to have you back. Enjoy your tea. All right, look alive, everyone. One day closer to show time. Well, if it isn't the handyman. Jack, right? Holly. Hi, Holly. Hi, Jack. How did your stand turn out? Lopsided... but I think there's still some time to save it. Maybe you could give me a hand later. Sure. Did you draw this? Yep. Wow. You're really talented. You must get that from your dad. You know my dad? I do, yeah... and he's very artistic... he used to doodle all day long in his notebooks. Really? Yeah. I've never seen him draw anything. He told me I took after my mom. Hey, you. Oh, what's all this? You brought lunch. I figured I'd bring dessert. Pecans... candied them myself. Oh, thank you, Stuart. These look so delicious. Don't they? Oh, sorry. Here. I'll get the spoon. Oh, Great. Okay, here you go. Here you are, there you go. I know! I know! I know... How excited are you? I'm so excited. Oh, I can't wait. So good. I, uh... I had a question for you, Caroline. Mm-hm. I was wondering if you'd like to accompany me... to the Winter Festival. Oh. I know you're running the concessions and all... but I thought-- I hoped I could convince you... to sneak away to watch the lights, with me. Aw... I'm so sorry, Stuart. I just don't think that's such a good idea. You see, I'm just gonna be so busy-- Of course. No, I understand. I just thought I'd take a shot. Hey, do you guys need help with anything?. Ah, no, I think she's got this under control. You ladies have a great afternoon. Same to you. Up a little. - Here? - No, to the right. - Here? - Yeah, perfect. Okay. Okay, what's next? Tinsel? That box right behind you. Okay. New York City. 2006. My first Christmas being away from home. I can't believe you kept all of these. Of course, I did. Even if you were a world away at Christmas... it was like having a little piece of you back home. I cherished every one you sent. Ah, Paris... of course, I must admit... I'm not too disappointed about skipping this year. Hold that thought. I figured I could deliver this one in person. This maybe my favorite. Okay, where do I put it? Right there. Here? Aw... Perfect. I'm so happy you're home. Eggnog. Careful, it may have a bit of a kick. Oh, really? Mm-hm, I added extra cinnamon. You're a wild one, Mom. Cheers. You know, this is my favorite tradition... after decorating the tree with your father? Eggnog on the porch. Look at him. He was so handsome in his dress blues. You know, he was wearing them the first night we met? I laid eyes on him and I was a goner. I can't believe it's been three years. Mom... have you ever considered dating again? Oh, Holly... your father was the love of my life. I can't imagine being with anyone else. Yeah, I know, but... Dad would want you to be happy. I am. Mr. McGuire seems nice. Stuart? You never told me you guys were so close. I mean, you know, he makes weekly deliveries from the farm. He seems awfully fond of you. Holly, we're just friends. I'm just teasing, Mom. But... if you were more than that... you know that'd be okay, right? I'm gonna go to bed. Okay, I'm just gonna spend a little more time... with my eggnog... if you don't mind. I miss him, too, Mom. Goodnight. Goodnight, sweetheart. Well, if I did not know any better... I would say that's a concession stand. Well, that's what I'm making, isn't it? Well, yesterday it was looking like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Yeah, well, I fixed it. Actually... Jack helped me out. Makes sense, he's a whiz at stuff like this. He's a-- he's a really great kid. Thank you, it's all my influence. I'm sure. You know, I am a good guy. I'm like a ray of sunshine in the lives of all around me. In fact, I want to show you something. What is it? You trust me? No. Follow me anyway. Can I get a drum roll? Want to do a drum roll? No. How about a high hat? No? Okay. Three, two, one, tah-dah. It's the spitting fish, we just got done with it. It's your favorite. This was your favorite, right? You remember that? Of course. Have you been to Murky Waters yet? No, I haven't had a chance yet. Oh... maybe we should go. The two of us? Yeah, my buddy's band is playing tonight actually. Like a date? I meant to be strictly platonic... but if your heart is set on a date, you can twist my arm. Are you seriously asking me out right now? Okay, are you with someone? Am I with someone? Okay... not interested, can't blame a guy for trying. You know what? Everyone told me to give you a chance. Try to be friends, but this is a new low, even for you. Find a new volunteer. Holly! You remember Betty Escher... she was a few years behind you in school. I think the last time you saw me, I was in braces. No! Yeah! Uh, of course, I remember you. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. I was just going to my room to grab my camera. Oh, no! Come sit down! You're not interrupting at all. I'll pour you some tea. Betty's helping with the concession stand. We were going to finalize the menu... but kind of got sidetracked with the wedding planning. Wedding planning? You're engaged. As of a two nights ago, he proposed at the park. When they were testing out some of the lights. Drops down to his knee right in front of the shooting stars. Isn't that just the most romantic thing... you've ever heard? Yeah. I'm hoping to convince your mom to cater for me. Oh, Betty, it's your big day. You should have a professional handle all that. Holly, please tell your momma... that no one makes a better peach cobbler. Holly could take pictures! Could you, Holly? I, uh-- Of course, she could. You are the best! Oh, I'm just the luckiest girl in the whole world! Oh, you're precious. Betty? Hey, hold up a second. What is it? Uh... I can't-- I can't go to your wedding. Oh, well, that's okay, I know we kinda put you on the spot. No, I mean, I can't go because... your fiancé made a pass at me. What? I-- I'm sorry, I didn't know if I should say anything. But I just didn't feel right keeping it from you. Um, when did this happen? Today... at the park. Maybe he was just being friendly? He's a real friendly guy. He asked me out on a date. Oh. I'm sorry. I don't know, I mean, maybe he just, uh... got caught up in the moment. I mean, we do have a past together, so-- A past? You dated Benny? Benny? Aren't you engaged to Mike? Wha-- Mike? No! He's like a brother to me. But I saw you two yesterday, he was spinning you around... and you guys were hugging. I was letting him know Benny proposed. He's the one who introduced us. Then who is Jack? That's Mike's nephew, Steve's little boy. Oh, Holly, you gave me quite a scare. Oh, and just so you know... Mike's as single as they come. If you need a date for the wedding. Huh. Oh, crap. Okay. These need to be taken outside. Yeah, that's the right box. Thank you. Good morning. Hi. What's that? Uh... an apology... And sticky buns, apology sticky buns. Hm... I didn't think you were coming back. Yeah, about that, I, uh... I may have assumed you had a wife and child. What? Look, I misread the situation, and I'm really sorry. Well, makes me feel a little bit better about the rejection. You want to start over? Can we? Holly? Holly? I didn't know you were in town. I didn't tell you. Oh, of course, you can have my number. Don't beg, it's embarrassing, there's people around. That's not how that happened. It's how I remember it. Okay, you're what, a day behind on your project? You need some help? That would be great. Ooh, nice shirt, by the way. I've been to Russia, France, Brazil... and last year I spent Christmas in Ukraine. Wow. Yeah. Do you know, they don't decorate their trees with tinsel? They use spider webs. Cool! Right? Hey, Holly? Yeah? Do you like mac and cheese? Yeah, why? Hey, Uncle Mike? Yeah. Can Holly come over for mac and cheese tonight? You should. Okay, I'll be there. Excuse me. Hey, Mike, you know where the ladder is? Yes, it's on Billy's truck, and he's at lunch. There's a light out on the shooting star... and the bulbs are all the way at the top. I can't climb that high. Who needs a ladder? Let's show 'em how it's done, bud. Those two are pretty close, huh? Oh, yeah... Steve's real lucky it worked out the way it did. What do you mean? He's overseas, you didn't know that? No. Well, he's in the Army. Mike's looking after Jack while he's deployed. What happened to Jack's mother? She was in the service, too. Heck, that's how they met. She passed a few years ago. That's awful. Mike had a life out in Nashville... but he dropped it all to come back here and look after Jack. That's what family does... that's a good man. Oh, wow! Betty, these look so good! Really? You're not just sparing my feelings, right? Have Holly try. I never spare feelings. Mm, mm-hm, yeah. See? Oh, by the way, Betty and Benny have invited... us to dinner tonight. If you're not busy. Actually, um, can I have a rain check? I have plans. Plans? Yeah, I'm going to Mike's. It's not like that. I did not say a thing. Uh, she didn't, but I will. I love this! It's just dinner. But dinner can lead to more. We tried more, that-- that did not work out. Well, what happened? It's a long story. Well, I don't have anywhere to be. Do you, Caroline? No, I live here. Okay, um, we graduated high school... and I went off to college. Holly was at the top of her class. Would you like to tell this? Sorry.. continue. Mike decided that he was gonna take a year off... and then follow me. Except, when it was time to go, he changed his mind. Oh. Said he didn't know what he wanted... and that he needed to go out and find it. And, apparently, that didn't include me. Well, you're both here. Maybe this is your second chance. You're here! I'm here. Follow me! I want to show you something in my room! Okay. Whoa. He's excited that you're here. Come on, Holly! Hi. Hi. These are fighter planes... this one's a Mustang and this one's a Tomcat. I also have a few bombers and some Army tanks... I'm trying to grow my collection. Wow, did you build all these? With my dad. You know, my dad used to fly in one of these. Really? Yeah, he was in the Air Force. He was stationed at Keesler Airbase. It's not far from here. That's cool. Yeah. This is what I'm working on now. It's Santa's sleigh. I'm gonna surprise my dad for Christmas. Ssh, you can't tell. Scout's honor. So, the cob webs were in the same box... as the Halloween decorations. Yeah, not exactly how they do it in Ukraine... but I like whatever's happening here. If you'll follow me, dinner is ready. You kept this? Yeah, it was a gift. Food's getting cold. You remember the time we went swimming after church... down behind McGuire's farm? Oh, my gosh, what were we, nine, ten? Ten... yeah, remember you rode on my bike... that I got for my birthday. Yeah, the one with the wobbly handlebars. They were not wobbly, you didn't sit on them right. Because they were wobbling. You wouldn't sit still. They weren't wobbly. Yes, they were. My mama was furious. She'd just bought me that new dress... and there I was, splashing in the creek. So... you guys used to be friends? Yeah... yeah, we were. Cool. Okay... okay... oh! Yes! Holly is amazing! That's a goal! Let's go again, best two out of three. Hello? Hey, little brother. Hey, man! Got your bags packed? Yeah, look, look, about that. Something's come up. Come on, Jack, you got this. Go for it! He scores! Jack, your dad's on the phone. Dad, guess what! We almost have the whole light show set up! I helped with the banner and Holly-- wait, do you know Holly? Holly said I draw really well. Is everything okay? Steve's stuck at the base. Storms are rolling in and they're grounding flights... for the next few days. Oh, no. He's trying to make arrangements when they settle down, but-- He's gonna miss Christmas. Jack! Jack. Hey, Jack! Jack, I'm really sorry. I know how much you were looking forward to your dad... coming home for Christmas. Look, bud, it's only gonna be a few more days. We can have our own celebration when he gets home. Come on, Jack, will you open the door for me? Can I try? Yeah. Hey, Jack? It's Holly, can we talk? Thanks for letting me come in. I know how hard it can be to keep saying goodbye to your dad. I had to do that a lot growing up. Did your dad ever miss Christmas? A couple of them, yeah. Really? What did you do? Can I show you something? One Christmas, just before he was scheduled to be deployed... again, my dad took me outside, he told me to choose a star. He said that whenever I missed him... I should look up at that star, and he'd do the same. We picked that one. The world's a big place, but knowing that he was looking... at the same star, suddenly he didn't seem so far away. Maybe when my dad gets back, we can do the same thing. I think that'd be a really good idea. Come here. Sorry, Dasher. No luck yet. Oh good, you're up! Good morning! Hi. What are you doing here so early? You up for a field trip? Wow, when did they build this place? About four years ago, after the hurricane... this town was in really rough shape. A lot of businesses were forced to shut down. They didn't want to, of course... but the insurance money doesn't cover everything. When the businesses go, the people aren't far behind. They built this resort, created a lot of jobs... and really helped Gulfport bounce back. And in a stroke of good luck... the developer was gonna build this in New Orleans... but at the very last minute, moved construction to here. Excuse me, we're picking up the lights for the festival. Could you help us out? Point us in the right direction? Oh, yeah, of course, follow me. So when Island View found out that the city was gonna... resurrect the light show... they not only gave us a big donation... they gave us all of their lights. We are coming to collect. All right, here we are. Whoa. Go check it out. Wait a minute... so this is my surprise? Helping you carry cardboard boxes? No, this is your surprise. Is that...? Ship Island? Yup. Best view of it in the city. Holly's dad used to take us fishing there. Yeah, and every Christmas, we'd go hunt for oysters. Yeah, we'd spend all morning out on that skiff. He said other than home, it's his favorite place to be. Can I see? Yeah. Here, I'll set it up for you again. Yeah, it's right there. Wow. Hey, Jack, take this quarter... and go-- go check out the view from over there. Okay, thank you. Thank you... for taking me here. Thought you might like it. You know, sometimes I wonder if he'd be proud of me. Of course, he would. He dedicated his life to something. What have I ever done? You show people things they've never seen before. I find that important. Maybe. Do you have time for one more stop? Uncle Mike! Yep. Can I go see Benny? Yeah. What's up, man? How's he doing? He's put on a brave face, but he's disappointed. Yeah, well, we'll just have to give him... the best Christmas ever, then. We? Yeah, we. Triplett's has my photos up? Yeah, that's why I took you here. A lot of places do. Why? A reminder... that there's a lot of good in this world. When I look at these photos, I don't see flooded streets. I don't see broken glass. I see the volunteers who handed out drinking water. I see fishermen spending hours on skiffs... searching for people stranded on their roofs. I see friends, I see family. I see strangers... I see neighbors. All coming together looking to help. Your pictures, they mean something to this town. So do you. Well, come on! Let us see it! Well, it's a little big in the belly! I think it looks great. Though you may need some extra padding to fill it out. There was a time that this would have fit me perfectly. My wife convinced me to skip the cookies. There... now you look like Santa. Oh... All right, the look's great, but we'd have to hear the vocals. Ho! Ho! Ho! No, no, wait, wait. Ho, ho, ho! No, no-- It should be deeper, so your stomach shakes... like a bowl full of jelly. A bowlful of jelly? Hoo-hoo-hoo. Ho-ho-ho. All right, I'll work on it. This is so itchy. Hey. Hey. Can I help you with something? Yes... information. Oh, I don't know much about the whole operation. I just make the stand, but I think I saw Benny-- Not about the festival... about you and Mike! There is no me and Mike. So you didn't ride in together today? Well, no, we did-- And you weren't at his house until almost 10:00 o'clock... the other night? What are you a lawyer? Actually, I am, but right now, I'm just being nosy. Oh... well, in that case, I plead the fifth. Come on. There's nothing to tell. I've been back for six days. But you and Mike dated for four years. Yeah, but I haven't seen him in like, almost ten years. Ugh, I can't wait that long. You're really invested in this. I love Mike, everyone does! When he was put in charge of the festival... the whole town lined up to help out. Incidentally, I was really happy to be teamed up with your mom... and the concession stand. She has the best gossip in town. Yeah, it's true. Mike's one of my absolute favorite people. And if anyone deserves happiness, it's him. Yeah, I want that for him, too... but this is just two friends catching up, that's all. Does he know that? All right. Come on, let's go! I can beat you, I'll beat you. All right, you guys ready to light up Mr. Kriss... a.k.a. Malibu Santa? Ready! All right, three, two-- They're not on. Okay... uh, don't tell Benny I was touching this. Okay, I'll figure it out, give me a second. Well, we're getting close to Christmas. Are you excited? I guess. You guess? My dad was supposed to come home for Christmas... but he's stuck. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Well, maybe-- maybe he could get unstuck. Do you really think that could happen? You know, Jack, I've learned to never count out a miracle... especially at Christmas. Whoa! I got it! Thanks for the ride. Anytime. Bye, Jack. Bye. Hey, Holly? Yeah? Are you doing anything later? I don't think so. Do you want to maybe... grab some dinner? Sure. Great! It's a date. Sure you don't mind watching Jack tonight? Oh, of course not! Okay. This little boy is a dream. Careful, that goes to his head. I heard that. Hey, what are you two doing tomorrow night? Since we'll all be working the light show... Christmas Eve, I'm having a little "Christmas Eve Eve"... dinner here at the house. You know, we had the same thought. I was gonna attempt a turkey. We bought a fire extinguisher last week, just in case. Jack... bro code, dude. You two have to come here! It's just gonna be Holly and me. And Lord knows, I'll have too much food. She will. You should come. Sounds good. You look beautiful. Thanks. Uh, Caroline. I promise to have her back before curfew. After you. - Bye, Momma. - Bye. Have fun. So, Jack, do you like gingerbread? Yeah. Boy, do I have a surprise for you. Ms. Caroline? Yes, Jack? Do you believe in miracles? I do. So... it's not silly to wish for them? Things may not always turn out the way you want them to, Jack. But there's nothing silly about having faith... that hard times are gonna get better. Now how about some icing? Here we are. I found it! I was hoping you could help me with something. It's kind of a... secret mission. What is it? Open it and see. Some have chimneys, but all have locks... the key to entry is in this box. It's a key. A master key. What does it open? Every house in Gulfport. In the South, not many houses have chimneys. So how is Santa supposed to deliver all of his toys? With this? It was given to my family many years ago for safe keeping. Holly used to be in charge of it, but now that she's older... I was hoping you could take the job. What do I do? When you get home, put the key in your mailbox. Santa will take it and use it on Christmas Eve. When Santa's finished... he'll find a way to get it back to you. So what do you think? I'll do it. You can count on me. I knew I could. Got it. Got what? Are you taking pictures of me? I wanted a spontaneous photo. Of the back of my head? That's not my good side. Okay, fine, then strike a pose. That's my good side. Got it. Let me see it. No, yeah, I don't want to see it. No. All right, where to next? I don't know, it's getting late... so maybe we should just head back. It's 9:00, city girl. Okay, well then, what do you suggest? Dessert. Okay. It was nice of Benny to give you the keys to this place. He owes me a favor. Okay, you ready? Yes. We have strawberry, chocolate, vanilla. D... all of the above. Stop. Good answer. You know, most people only get two scoops. I've always made yours with three. Well, no wonder I fell for you. Three. You've still got it. Thank you, thank you very much. I've had some practice. Benny lets me and Jack come over here on Sundays. I get to make him one. You're really good with him. He's my buddy. No, I'm serious. What you're doing for your brother, that's... that's really special. Well, he's the one defending our country. It's the least I could do. No, it's not. Not many people would make that kind of sacrifice. Yeah... you know, for a while... I didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life. I was bouncing around a little bit. I had a bartending gig in Nashville. I got a guitar, played a few open mic nights. Were you any good? No. But it was starting to feel comfortable... starting to feel like home. But that's when Steve called and I knew I had to come back. Do you ever miss it? Your old life? No. I finally feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be. I guess you don't always have to go looking for what you need. Sometimes it finds you. How's that shake? It's really good. Not bad. Here? Absolutely. Why not? There's tables in the way. You're right. There's another one. Now, I know you didn't miss me... but... you can't tell me you didn't miss home. I have. And I may have missed you a little, too... despite my better judgment. Of course, of course. Delivered safe and sound just like I had promised. I had a really nice night. You mind if I get that in writing. What do you know? Oh, sorry! I saw headlights. It's okay, we were just about to head in. How's Jack? Out like a light on the couch. I'll grab him. Subtle. I believe it was your suggestion. Thank you, Caroline. Mm... anytime. Well, see you tomorrow. I don't know, it was... nice. Nice is good. Nice is strange. Why strange? I just never thought I'd consider... opening that door again. And you're considering it now? Maybe? I don't know... it felt... right. Hello. Holly! Turns out the race is a little tighter than I thought. Lopez was in the office today... I think she impressed a lot of people. Okay, is there anything I can do? Bates is leaving town the day after Christmas... to go on vacation. If you can get back here in the next few days... I can get you some face time with him... I think it could seal the deal. On Christmas Eve? If you really want the job, I think the smart thing... to do is to get on the next flight out. The window is closing, let me know. Why don't I get us some more pie. So, what are you going to do? I have to go back, right? You're asking me? I'd miss Christmas... and the light show. And then there's Mike and Jack... I don't know. You need to do whatever it takes to make sure they choose you. That is... if it's still what you want. Mom, I'd be crazy to turn this down. Well then, sounds like you've made up your mind. Yeah. Hey. Hey. I didn't know-- I meant to tell you, I talked to Benny and I got him... to reserve you and Jack two of the best seats... for tomorrow night's show... right in there front. Actually, I-- I need to talk to you about that. What's up? Okay, well-- So, last night, I got a call-- Mike! I'm sorry, Holly. I need to steal this guy for a second. Look, we need you down at festival site. I think the gingerbread house got unloaded... in the wrong spot, that's one heavy cookie. Okay, uh... Go, take care of it. You sure? I'm sorry. No, it's okay, we'll talk tonight at dinner. Okay. Ready? Yes. Okay, knives, you're gonna chop. Okay. Perfect. Hi. Hi. Hi! Merry Christmas Eve-Eve! Well, don't you look festive. Come on in. Holly's father always started dinner with a prayer... so, Jack, would you like to do the honors? Thank you for this meal we are about to receive. Thank you for Uncle Mike... thank you for Holly... and thank you for Miss Caroline. And please watch over my dad until he gets home. - Amen. - Amen. Amen. This looks fantastic. Oh, Holly helped. Holly mostly watched. How are things going down at the festival? Well, your daughter built the world's greatest... concession stand. I mean, I'd deny it, but that would be a lie. Well, everyone I've talked to is so excited for the show. I can't wait to see it again after all these years. It's gonna be really special, Mom. I hope so, this town needs it. Hey, Holly, guess what? What? My dad said whenever he gets home... he's gonna take me to Ship Island. Really? Yeah, Steve's buddy is out of town until the New Year... said we could use his boat, pack a lunch, make a whole day of it. Oh, that's so cool, I'm so jealous. You don't have to be. We'd like you to come along. How could I say no? Wondering where you snuck off to. Everything okay? Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out how I tell you this. Tell me what? I have to leave tomorrow... to go back to Los Angeles. Like an assignment? This magazine that I've done some freelance work for... in the past is hiring a new photo editor... and they're considering me for the job. Wow. That sounds like a pretty, big deal. It would be, yeah. Hey, bud. Uncle Mike! Yeah. Can I give it to her? Absolutely. Merry Christmas. Thank you. I love it. You're welcome. Hey! I brought you some turkey, stuffing and some extra cobbler. You're the best, thank you. Aw... Goodnight! Goodnight. Are you leaving? Yeah, gotta get this guy to bed, we have a big day tomorrow, so-- Right. Hey, Jack, do me a favor, bud, will you take this to the truck? I'll be there in a second, okay? Yes, sir. Thank you for my present. You're welcome. So no light show. No light show. I really wanted to be there. I know you did. Sounds like a great opportunity. I'm really happy for you... congratulations. I guess this is goodbye. I'm gonna miss you. Stay in touch this time. I will. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Do you have everything? I think so. Could you hang on to Prancer for me? In case someone claims him? Of course, kinda grown attached to the little guy. Come on. You know, Mom, you don't have to drive me to the airport. I know you have a lot of work to do for tonight. It's Christmas Eve and I am going to spend every second... that I can with you and that's the end of it. Oh. Hello? Sure. Yeah, of course! Yes! I can meet you there. Okay, bye-bye. Slight change of plans. Hey, have you seen Holly? We're getting ready to move her stand out into the park. Should we wait? Nah, it's crunch time. You mind setting it up? I don't think she's gonna mind. All right, you got it, boss man. Thank you. Excuse me, I think this guy may belong to you. Thank you. Thank you so much for coming down here. You have saved my granddaughter's Christmas. I'm just glad it actually worked out. It was kind of a shot in the dark. Can I buy you lunch? It's the least I can do. I have a plane to catch, but thank you. Okay, then next time you're in town. You own this place? I do, have you stayed with us? No, I haven't, but I heard all about what you did... for Gulfport, after the hurricane. Well, this town is close to my heart. I grew up here. Really? Yeah, I was halfway around the world when the storm hit and... tell you the truth, I hadn't thought of this little town... in ages, but when I saw those pictures of what had happened... I knew I had to do something. There was one in particular of this-- of this mother... holding her little baby and she's about the age... of my granddaughter at the time and, well, she had this look... of determination in the middle of all this destruction. I won't forget that. I called our developer that night. All because you saw a photo? Well, even though I was halfway around the world... for that moment, it just took me back home... and now I am here to stay. All right, what do you want to do first, man? I wish my dad was here. Yeah, me, too. ... and Holly. Me, too. What did you want me to do, ask her to stay? You're right, I should have asked her to stay. Come on. Evening, everyone. Hi, Mr. McGuire! Didn't Caroline do a fabulous job? Aw... Of course, knew she would. So, uh, any recommendations? Well, the sticky buns seem to be a big hit. Those do look good. Listen, Caroline, I feel like I've made you uncomfortable. No... no, you didn't do anything wrong. I was-- I was flattered. Well, I hope we can still be friends? Sure would hate to lose my best customer. Of course. Great. No... it's on me. Thank you. Well... enjoy the show. You, too. Alright. Hello Gulfport. I just want to welcome everyone to the annual... Harbor Lights Festival. First, a huge round of applause for all of our volunteers. Without their hard work, we can't do this. And a huge thank you to Mayor Billy Hughes... and the city for all of their support. I think we all know why this year's festival is so special. Five years ago, our community was thrown quite a curveball... and we didn't let it beat us... and we got through it side-by-side... Holly! Hey! ...because we're a family. And what better time to celebrate family... than at Christmas? So, if you haven't already, please grab a spot on the lawn. Grab a chair, and since it's actually a tad chilly tonight. Cozy up with your loved one, sit back and relax. Enjoy the show. Let there be light. Great show, captain. Shouldn't you be on an airplane? Yeah, well, I uh, I turned down the job. Really? Yeah. I uh... I decided I didn't want to give this up. The security would have been nice... and the money would have been nicer, but... I'm meant to be behind the camera. You know, all I've ever wanted is to make a difference... a real difference, and this is how I can do it. I talked to my old editor and I pitched him a new series... about Gulfport's recovery, and he loved it. This town can inspire a lot of people... and I want to be a part of that. And I want to do that... with you. Uncle Mike! Holly! Santa's here! Come on! Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas! Everyone, please, please gather around. Hello, hello. Nice to meet you. How are you? Excuse me. Excuse me! Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas! Excuse me, excuse me. Thank you. Oh! Well hi there. Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas! He gets quite a lot of volume. I think his ho-ho-ho might put mine to shame. Mr. Kriss? Wait, if you're here... Who's in the suit? Hey! You're not Mr. Kriss. No, Jack... I'm not. Dad! Steve? How did he get here? I may have called in a favor. Hey, man, how you doing? I've got some great news, Jack. I've been reassigned to a base nearby. So you're staying? For good? For good, Jack. Not bad, huh? Yes, dear. Oh, ho, no, I'm on my way now. I uh-- I had an early gift to deliver. Well... it's gonna be a wonderful night! Uh-huh, but you don't have to wait up, as usual. I'll see you then. Ho! Ho! Ho! That one wasn't so bad. Ho! Ho! Ho! So, you glad you stayed? Yeah. I am. What now? Well, I was planning on kissing you. Here, let me. Thanks, sweetie. Uh-uh, I got it, I got it. I can carry one. I know, but you don't have to. Well, it looks like you've run out of hands, so-- I'll just take this one, thanks! Wait, is it too heavy? You can rest if you need to! Whew! This one? Yep... thanks. There you go. Any special requests for Christmas dinner? Hm... peach cobbler. Ah! You got it. My dad bought the turkey last night. He says that I can help him whenever he deep fries it. Do me a favor? Will you guys grab these bows... and hit the concession stand with them? Thank you, thank you. Hey, Allison? Yeah, yeah, right by the tree. Thank you. Guess who? Betty? I'm never gonna live that down, am I? You're not supposed to be back for three hours. What are you doing? Oh, I gave you a conservative estimate. Helps with the whole surprise thing. How was Paris? It was great! But I'm really glad to be home. Oh... I got you something. Please be croissants. Please be croissants. Sadly, they don't travel well. Holly! Hey, Jack! So, Jack has been working on the banner. No better man for the job. Thanks. Should we show her? Now? Why not? Okay. Oh-- Um, it's a miscommunication... we didn't have time for a trial run. This has been the best year of my life. And I know there's a person out there for everyone... and for me, it's you. Of course, had you been here two hours later... there'd be a string quartet and six dozen roses. The second I saw you, I knew I couldn't wait one more moment... to ask you to be my wife. So, will you? Yes. Come here. I love you. I love you. I can't believe you did all this. All I got you is an Eifel Tower tie. I can wear it for the wedding. Welcome to the family! Hey, bud. Yes! Congrats. You gettin' married. Yeah. Love is beautiful. You guys, we got a show to do! Back to work!
