Joséke, come here, sweetie. Come here, honey. -Tot ziens. -Tot ziens. -It's not daylight yet. -No. -Need a ride, Gaston? -No, Schots. -Schmidt is getting the car. Good night. -Good night. Goodbye, Denise. -I'll call you. -Yes, yes. Sorry, goodbye. -What are they up to? -They're coming, don't worry. I'm not worried, but it's late, that's all. No, Schmidt, that's all right. Tot ziens. -Tot ziens. Thanks. -Yes, so long. See you again soon. death is almighty and only creates illusions - Chassignet -Did you pick her up at the ball? -That's my daughter, watch your mouth. Yes, boss. Sorry, I didnhet mean anything by it. -Hello, boss. -Mertens. -Hello, meneer Schmidt. -Right, show me what's not working. He'll get the man from the factory. This chain. It's not all that bad. Come, I'll show it to you right now. Schmidt, this is the first time she's come here, the very first time. Come over here. Come. You hold it like this and hit him on the head. Damn it, Marie-Rose, don't do that. Stop it, damn it. Give me that. You can put the cows to sleep later, but give me that first. -Donhet touch my daughter. -She's holding on to me. Marie-Rose, enough. We're leaving. Can I sleep with you? No, I have a lot of work and I must go to the clinic. Come. Let's go. I have an appointment with Dokter Gevers at noon. Go with your father, come on. My flower. Move it. -I want to stay with Thomas. -Forget about Schmidt. Forever. You wish. See me if you want to talk. I wish he were the boss. But once they become boss, they are all the same. Yes, nurse, I have 25 years of experience and I still question if the responsible thing to do is tell a condemned patient like meneer Schmidt… …the truth. Kitty. Kitty, come to papa, come. Duprez residence. One moment, please. Marie-Rose. Thomas. Hello? Thomas? Yes, it's me. A what? What is the matter? Thomas? Thomas, answer me. Hello, Schmidt. Duprez here. Is something the matter at the slaughterhouse? Schmidt? -He hung up. -Of course, he wanted to speak to me. He has nothing to do with you, or you with him. All he wants is that slaughterhouse, nothing else. Get it through your head. Coffee and cigarettes. What's this I hear? You're not in shape anymore? -But I still have my brains. -How does that help you in the ring? Stop by and you'll see. Goodbye, Angèle. Until next time. Goodbye, Tarzan. Come on, show us. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Love, love. Mind if I sit here? -There are other free tables. -I know. Leave. -Leave, leave, leave, leave. -No. You're not afraid? Afraid? Why aren het you afraid? You wouldnhet understand. It's true, actually. I'm not afraid of anything anymore. I… I bought this. You want to buy it? -What would I do with that? -It's just another solution. Solution for what? -Give it a try. -You know… …you don't really need it. -See? You're afraid after all. -Yes. Of course. Hé, schatje, are you in the mood? Hé, don't you feel like it? Come in, love. I'll show you a good time, baby. Are you lonely? Come. -No, I'm not here for that. -Nobody comes here for that. Only for that. No. I'm not with the police. Here. For you. What do I have to do for that? Nothing, dear. Nothing. -Sorry. Wasnhet she nice enough? -Why do you ask? -I protect her. -Against what? From riffraff, sir. It's getting worse every day. Do you like girls? -Leave me alone. -I need it. Right, give the money to Serge. Come on. I'm only doing it to help, otherwise they can be in terrible danger. Do you like girls? I know a terrific singer, very classy. Ideal for someone of your standing. There she is, the small girl. You were just with her, right? Every morning she needs her shot or she goes crazy. It's very sad, but… Did you get it, Serge? We're here to help each other, right? Can I help you? -Champagne and two glasses. -Yes, sir. -And get rid of the woman. -Yes, sir. -Will you have drink. -No, thanks. -A kiss. -Leave me alone. Hé, young man. I beg your excuseer, Schots. The lady is not available. Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please. All the way from Berlin: Pierrot from Berlin. -I really liked your song. -I'm sorry, I'm French. -You're not from around here. -Why? Nobody here would have done what you did. -Meneer Schots is an influential man. -I know. I know him personally. -Then you're in trouble -I don't care. I want to talk with you tonight. I'm not that kind of women. Hold on. What are you up to? I want you to stay with him. I want his money. Go on. Yes. Your place or mine? Good night. Good night. Good night. -How much? -30,000 francs. -Are you sure she gave you all of it? -Of course, I searched her. He's got plenty more. Come on, let's go and celebrate. You are buying the drinks, right, Serge? Have a seat. -Do you need my help? -Donhet bother, the place is a mess. My sister is staying here now. Wait. I only want to talk. You really meant it? -Of course. -Shall I make you some coffee? -Good idea. When there's nothing more for me to learn here, Rocco says we'll go to Paris. Rocco? You know him, you came in with him. He got me the singing job. Is singing all you do? Yes, that's all. Do you know why I went with you? Because I thought you were nice. -You don't believe me? -No. But it doesnhet matter. Your voice is beautiful when you sing and when you speak too. You wanted to talk with me, but all you do is listen. Tell me something. -Donhet you have anything to say? -You know, I think that… I'm going to sleep at home. -You can sleep here. No, I'm going home. I'm not tired and I still have to tidy up. Lie down. -And you? Where will you sleep? -On the couch. I like it when there is somebody here. Wonhet your sister be coming home? -You'll be wide awake by then. Goed. I've got to go. Tot ziens, girls. Come along, Serge. There are checks in the other pocket. -I'll pay you back all of it. -No, no, take it. You can have it. But why? I don't need it anymore. -I didnhet take it for me. -Is it for Rocco? Yes. He saw you had money and he told me to take it. That's all. I canhet refuse him. What's wrong? -Donhet hit me. Donhet be afraid. This is for you. I'll keep the rest. -I have a better idea. -What? You'll see. Is that all? -Where are you going? -To see Thomas. -Something's wrong with him. -You had better stay here. -No, I'm going. -When will you be back, dear? When I feel like it. I'll be back with Thomas, when I feel like it. Are you out of your mind? You are staying here. -Schmidt is laughing at you. -What makes you say that? Do you really want to know? He was with a hooker all night. -That's a lie. -Ask Schots. He saw him last night in the Joy. Yes, it's true. -Good morning. -Hello, mailman. How are you? -Want a beer? -No, thank you. -Are you broke? -Flat broke. -Who is it, Angèle? -He's over there. Thank you. You requested to see Weismüller. -I requested to see you. -I am Weismüller. What can Weismüller do for you? I want to buy a revolver. Weismüller doesnhet sell revolvers. When do you need it? -Today. -Today? It will cost you. A lot more. -Not a problem. -Weismüller will do what he can. Ten thousand now and the rest on delivery. -Today. -You can count on Weismüller, sir. Angèle. So long. We have a job for Rocco. Wake him, hurry. Rocco. Serge is here. -This early? -Something about job. I don't know. Hand me my robe. My little sister. Donhet move. I'm sorry. One canhet be too careful nowadays. -Are you a friend of Weismüller's? -A very good one. Come. Excellent quality. I don't know about them. If you can shoot, it doesnhet matter which one you buy. I bet. How does that one work? Easy. What do you want it for? Right, none of my business. How much? 28 thousand, 20 and 25 thousand. And yours? Not for sale. 30 thousand. Forty. Alright, fifty. I really shouldnhet do it, but for you I will. -And because it's a lot of money. -Well, money… -Is it loaded? -It certainly is. Yes. Come, come. Donhet shoot, buddy. One last chance, boss. One tiny chance? Take it easy, take it easy. What did I ever do to you? Here's your money. I don't want it anymore. -You're a sick man. -Yes, sick. Knock it off. Donhet mess with me, oké? I'm not afraid of you. I am Rocco. The great Rocco. You shot me. You bastard. You're a dead man. I'll kill you. Get out of here. I'm not a killer. Let's go. -Where to? -Where we always go. REQUEST FOR X-RAY -Miss? -Duprez. Marie-Rose Duprez. I'd like to speak to Dokter Gevers. It's urgent. -You have an appointment? -It's urgent. It's about Thomas Schmidt's checkup. -Oh, Thomas Schmidt? You know what to do. No initiatives. I'm going to see you-know-who. -Who is the big boss? -He always goes alone. -You are far too nosy. -Not nosy. A little anxious that's all. Damn it. Come, so you can understand what I mean. Nurse, close the curtains. Look, do you see this bright spot? It's a neoplasm. What you call lung cancer. The entire lung is affected and is inoperable. -How is a mistake like that possible? -A regrettable administrative error. Schmidt with dt, Schmitt with two het s, it's quite similar. Personally, it touched me deeply, take it from me. -You must inform him. -Why don't you give him the good news? I'm looking for him. -He has disappeared. -Donhet be pessimistic. Some people shoot themselves in the head is such cases. Not meneer Schmidt. Marie. Marie, what's wrong? Why are you crying? -They got him. -What? Who? Rocco. -My husband. -Your husband? Marie-Rose. What a pleasant surprise. You look gorgeous. -Where were you last night? -Aren het you nosy. -Do you want a drink? -No, thank you. I'm looking for Thomas. He's not good for you, Marie-Rose. Why don't you drop him? I'll decide that, if you don't mind. You don't know your father. Maybe Daddy doesnhet understand me. Tell where you last saw Thomas. It's important. Yes. -But don't tell your father, alright? -No, I promise. -Heroin? -Most likely. -Do you know him? -Yes. Inspector. -Did you make the call? -Me, sir? I happened to pass by. -Alright. -Men, check everything. -Are your shoes always this clean? -You think so? -Now give me the rest of the dough. -The dough? You want me to have them strip you? You seem surprised, eh? Yes, but… how did you know? I had a hunch, Cools. I knew nothing, but remember this: If you know nothing, do something anyway. If you see him or know where he is, warn Weismüller right away. -Miss? -I'd like to ask you something. But this is a bar, you have to order a drink first. -Alright, I'll have a tea please. -Milk or lemon? Milk. Goodbye, Angèle. -You were followed. -I know. You should be more careful. Weismüller pays attention. -Why didnhet you warn me? -It was too late. May I ask you something? Do you know Cabaret Joy? -They say it's down the street. -Yes. Are you looking for work? No, not that. -Idiot. -You managed to shake him. I hope so. -We need to act fast. -Weismüller only knows one method. I'm not surprised. Just tell me what Rocco's killer said. There's something fishy about all this. -Revenge? Organized crime maybe? -Brilliant idea, but out of the question. -Why? -They don't usually shoot each other. -Maybe he became a nuisance. -Then we would never have found him. But I know someone who can tell me more. -Are you Marie? -Do I know you? -I am Thomas's fiancée. -Who is Thomas? I believe he spent the night here. I didnhet know his name. And I didnhet know he had a fiancé. He didnhet mention you. That's not why I can here. Do you know why he stayed the night? -Does he think he's going to die? -To die? There was mix-up with his X-rays in the hospital. He's not sick at all. Do you understand? We must tell him. Do you understand? I understand. What makes you think that I'll see him again? I don't. But you never know. In any case, if he comes back, tell him. -I wonhet see him again. -Why not? -I thinks he's going to die soon. -No, he's not sick. -It's not what I mean. -Why? What happened? -What do I tell him if I see him again? -That he is not sick. That I will wait for him, to come back. You are very beautiful, but very young, miss. Inspection. -That's all. -Come on in. Come on, keep at it. -Liesje, go play outside. -But I haven het finished my homework. Daddy needs to talk to these gentlemen. Please sit down. Rocco. -What do you know about him? -Is that why you are here? I have no choice. I have no leads and the brass wants results fast. Rocco is small fry. The boss is who they should arrest. -Why don't you tell us how to do that. -I will, I will. I came quite close this afternoon. Really? You've been saying that for years. Yes, but now his time is running out. Here. But I do expect results, oké? You'll get them, but keep your men away from here. It's bad enough that you have come here. Right. Everything is in order. -If there's anything I can do to help. -Yeah right. Cools? Good afternoon, sir. -Tot ziens, little girl. -Tot ziens, sir. Come on, Liesje, go finish your homework. Say, this is not a playschool. Go on, get to work. So I am worried about nothing. But of course. Your daughter doesnhet come home, but I am worried about nothing. And you? What do you do? Eat. What does madam do while her daughter is who knows where? -Madam eats. -Marie-Rose is with Thomas, of course. -How do you know? -Where else would she be? She was not seen at Schmidt's. Maybe she went shopping while Thomas is at work. -Schmidt didnhet come to work today. -Young people are like that now. When they are in love, they don't think about work. Denise, I am very worried. Would you mind calling him? Everything went well. Our man received it this afternoon. No, the cops stopped by. I am absolutely certain. Yes. Yes, Weismüller will wait. Very well. Very well. It's you. -Can I come in? -Why would I let you in? You wonhet let Thomas come into our house. I always thought you would not be happy with him. But now I'm not so sure. Go ahead and sit down. -I have something awkward to tell you. -I'm listening. Alright. I was wrong about Thomas. If you really want to marry him, I have no objection. What made you change your mind? It suddenly dawned on me. It's your choice, as it should be. You have to live with him, not me. -Does Mama know? -She's home. She's waiting for you. So that's it: i'm expected at home, Mama is very worried. Why not wait for Thomas with her? -No. I'd rather stay here. -Why is that? We need each other, I love him. You wouldnhet understand. Have a little faith in your father. -Who do you work for? Tell me. -No idea, I only know the go-betweens. I don't know the big boss. -Let's go. The go-between. -Where? They'll kill me. Shall I do it instead? Marie-Rose. Marie-Rose, hurry. I'll wait for you in the car. THOMAS, YOU ARE NOT SICK MARIE-ROSE Let me go. They will kill me. Who are you? What do you want? Be quiet. Donhet shoot. -That's him. -Who? -That man with the cap. -Tot ziens, guys. See you tomorrow. -No way. -It's true. He acts the part so no one will suspect him, but it's him. I don't believe it. Let me go. -Get out and talk to him. -Me? I don't think so. -He doesnhet know you? -Of course he does. -But I don't want him to see me here. -Do it, get out. Excuse me, is there a gas station around here? Goodbye. I should never have done this. Get lost. Daddy, Daddy. Donhet stay here. The police will be here any minute. Donhet stay here. -Where is Marie's dressing room? -Marie? The door across the hall. What's the matter? The five or six weeks I have left, will you spend them with me? But, Thomas… Yes, I'd like that. Yes. What's wrong with you? -I have killed again. -What? Yes. The big boss. I killed him. -Who was it? -He pretends to be a boxing coach. -What are you talking about? -The old man with the cap. -Did you kill him? -Yes. What made you to do a thing like that? Everyone knows he's a snitch. What have they told you? How could you believe a thing like that? Nobody knows who the big boss is. Why are you doing this? You are not responsible for the entire planet. -Let's go away. -Stay calm. Let's think about this. Where are you going? -To the police. -Wait. There's something else. You are not sick. You don't have anything. The hospital made a mistake. Your fiancée is looking for you. You are fine. -You are not sick. -You're lying. Why didnhet you tell me right away? Because you said you wanted to stay with me. And I would like that. It's not true. It's not true. It's not true. Yes. Dorian Gray. Schmidt is inside. Of course. Everything is oké. It will be decided in tomorrow's cabinet meeting. This morning a second bullet-ridden corpse was found in a gym near the North Station. The police still don't have a lead. Everything points to a revenge killing and that organized crime is involved. Here too they found no evidence or clues and no weapon was found. The second victim was a known informer… Hello, Thomas. What do you want? Can I come in? Thomas. Thomas. I… know everything. I respect you, Thomas. I always have. You know that my daughter is set on marrying you. Yes, that is not exactly news. No. But now she has my permission. I don't have any objections. And what if something has happened that canhet be undone by anyone? If it concerns my daughter 's happiness, there is nothing anyone can do about it. Marie-Rosalie Duprez, do you take Thomas Richard Schmidt as your lawfully wedded husband and promise to be true to him in good times and bad, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health? Yes. I do. Thomas Richard Schmidt, will you take Marie-Rosalie Duprez as your wife and promise to be true to her in good times and bad, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health? Yes. Meneer Schmidt. Meneer Schots. -The father and mother of the bride. -No, no. Donhet get up, don't get up. Thomas. -What is that? -I don't know. A present from Daddy. What's in it? Open it. What is it? You must admit that such a weapon is much nicer with a whole barrel. To your health. Donhet you like your present?
