Look at that. Oh, no! He's running it. Oh, watch out for the flea flicker. Run, run, run, run. You got it, Dad! Go line stands! Defense! Come on. - Boom! - Shit! - Nice run, nice run. - Nice run. Alright that's it for me. See you later, fellas. Let's go, Jackie. It's gonna be late. Your mom's gonna kill me. Give me my watch. - Come on. - Your watch, alright. Jesus. Why'd you let him score? I would have ripped his head off. Oh, yeah? Is that right, smartass? You know that's the guy who got me in the local. I wouldn't have a job if it wasn't for him. If you're lucky knucklehead, he'll get you in the unions, too. I ain't ever working construction. Well, is that right? You're too good to work with your dad? - I never said that. - Sure, you did. Look around. See this neighborhood? This is as good as it's gonna get for us, kid. Yeah, right. I am getting out of this dump. Oh, really? What's your plan? Enlighten me. I don't know. I'm gonna be in Point or something. Yeah, you're gonna join the circus? - You're gonna be a clown? - No. You're gonna grind it out just like the rest of us, you hear me? Put down the pumpkin, Jackie. Shoot it. Don't do it. - Great shot. - Thanks. Where'd you learn to shoot like that? Has Randy been teaching you basketball? You know I hate that monkey ball. I don't know. I want to be a football player like you. Yeah, sure you do. Don't bullshit a bullshitter. Listen, why don't you guys get out of here. This isn't the brothers' court. So why don't you guys just go back to your neighborhood, alright? Dad! Jackie, get your ass back here. You heard me. Get the fuck out of here. Jackie! Jackie! ...called the white Michael Jordan and he's not even in the NBA. Instead, New Yorker Jack Ryan has developed his skills while playing... Like, I am just amazed. He's one of the best white players I've ever seen. He was a show-off. He was an entertainer. If the three-point shot were in effect, he probably would have averaged between 35 and 40 points a game. He's the only white boy other than Chris Mullin that has the type of respect universally from borough to borough. Seen them all. He's one of the best shooters I've ever seen in my life, bar none. Jackie Ryan is one of the biggest wastes of talent in the history of basketball. Two, two, two, two. Oh, God! Motherfucker! Coach! Coach! Coach! You alright, Jackie? - Come on, Jack, flub up. - Come on, Jackie. Come on, Jackie. I got money on this game. Let's go. Like a fucking D. See this fuckin' dude right there? See this fuckin' white boy? We got to get this dude off the fucking court. Come on, man. Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. - Come on, man. You fucking kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me? - Hey, bro. - Hey, my man. Let's fucking go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That's enough. - Yo, what are you doing? No more fucking playing! Not you, not you, all you fucking white boys get the fuck out of here. You look half white yourself, bro. Get the fuck outta here. You and your men, it's over. - Shut the fuck up, man. What? - I've been playing on this court since I was 13 years old, man. Man, Yusef Hawkins was playing at this court at 13. - See what happened to him. - That had nothing to do with us, bro. Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Why you act like a knucklehead, bro? What's up? Get the fuck off of me. So, has he been playing on this court since 13... I'm not on you, you'll know when I'm on you. Yeah, you want the fucking ball? No one's fucking playing anymore, man. Go get the fucking ball. - What the fuck, man? - Go get the fucking ball, okay? No one's playing over here anymore. - Fuck off this court. - ...ass, whipping your ass. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go whip your ass over. Get the fuck off here. Yusef Hawkins, Yusef Hawkins, Yusef Hawkins. - That had nothing to do with us. - Shut up. Get the fuck out of here. Take your fucking bike and get off my court. Grab my chair, bro. Get my fucking chair. Here you go, Marty. Good man, Farrell. Just keep them coming. Put them on my tab. - You're good, Jackie? - I'm good, Farrell. Thank you. Wow, what's with all the wool today? Is that Jenny, your Jenny? Holy Christ, she looks beautiful. She looks great. What's she doing here? I think she is visiting her mother. - I thought she has left here from the divorce? - No, no. - Really? - She's back for a little bit. - Well, let's say... - No, no. Come on. Hey, ladies. - Hi. - Hi. Jenny Burke, the only person in high school to average more points than me. Yeah. Well, the only reason I scored more points than you is because my teammates actually liked me. I mean I would have passed the ball more if they were open. - Hi, Marty. - Hey. I mean, look, look, I... I've heard college does wonders, but wow, you obviously have grown out of your awkward stage. I see you two clowns haven't grown up at all. What are you doing back? - I'm coaching at Pace. - That's cool. Yeah, I'm staying with my parents for a while trying to get some money for a place in the city. - What about you? - I'm... - Oh, him? He ain't doing shit. I'm doing great. Thank you very much, Marty. I'm, uh, I'm doing construction with my old man. - Well, that's nice. - Yeah. Um, can I buy you a drink? Uh, I don't think that's a good idea. You know, you might scare these girls off. They're not used to the Brooklyn dogs like I am. What do you mean Brooklyn dogs? We don't bite. - We'll get out of here. - No, no. Hold on. - I want to know. - See you around. - No, wait. It was good seeing you, Jenny. You, too. I take offense to that, Jack. I've never been a Brooklyn dog. - Farrell, I look like a Brooklyn dog to you? - No. Thank you so much. Man, she looks fantastic. You still got that fucking rat tail, you little midget? Dildo. I mean, Dino. Still talking shit outta your ass? What about you, tough guy? You still playing ball with the grannies on Tuesday nights? I don't know, is your mother still giving free hand jobs on Wednesday, Dino? You give him a hand job when he gets cold at night? Oh, speaking of hand jobs, maybe I'll grab a couple of shots and go see your little skirt Jenny? No, no Jackie. No, no. - Jackie, no. - Come on. Who's the fucking bitch now, bitch. Call me, alright? Mm-hmm. I see not much has changed. Hey, Pete Vecsey. What are you doing in Brooklyn, huh? You missed your stop? I was looking for you. Huh, my address isn't listed. Well, it wasn't hard. I mean, you're a very popular guy Blackjack. Alright, Sherman told me. Ah. So, what's going on? How's the writing? Slow, slow, you know. Summer pro-am games here and there, but I did catch that game down on West 4th Street the other day. Let me ask you something. Why are you working on your game if you're not playing for anything? Well, reputation, I guess. What if I told you that I could get you to try out with the New Jersey Nets? - I'd say you're full of shit. - Why not? I mean, I see, I see you running circles around these kids. No thanks. You know, I'm working on a piece for Sports Illustrated on Gill Turner. He's a real big free agent now. Yeah? So am I. He says he wants to, you know, stick around home. A lot to say about, uh, how important basketball was in the city. - Maybe I can get a quote from you. - Fuck that. Not happening. Jackie, you and I both know there is no reason that you should not be playing in the league. You know, you come all the way down here to ask me for a quote about Gill Turner. Go fuck yourself, Pete. Get the fuck out of the way. But the gang armed with a gun and baseball bats allegedly mistook Hawkins for the boyfriend of a white girl in the neighborhood. So, what, now all white people are bad? Yeah, I remember this. It's like they forgot white people built the Brooklyn Bridge. Hey, jerk-off. What did I tell you about that bike in the house? It's gonna rain. Ma! Leave it outside, please. Hey, how did today go by the way? Don't encourage him. You know your brother worked a double shift today. Oh, that's wonderful. Where's your girl? With her mom. Sorry, bro. Will you pipe down? I can't hear the TV. - Chrissy, how you doing? - I'm good. How are you? Good, good. Hey, Suzie, shouldn't you be with your boyfriend? We're fighting, but it's for real this time. You'd know more about your family if you spent less time with the brothers and the booze. - Okay, Pop. Ma, can I clean up? - Mm-hmm. What, you got a hot date? Look at him, 28-year-old playboy living at home with his parents, rent-free. Pa, you remember Jenny Burke. I just seen her at Faros, you believe that? You got no shot with Jenny Burke. Fuck you, Billy. I'm glad you saw her, very nice girl. Right? Hmm, go take a shower, I'll... I'll get dinner going. The bike, fucko. And there was some guy looking for you. Yeah, it's a big-time reporter, thinks I can play in the NBA. How do you like them apples? And I could be the starting quarterback to the Jets. Yo, Pete! Wait up. - What? You're agreeing to that quote now? - No. Look, they don't sound interested, don't beg. I don't want it to sound like I'm begging for a favor. - Mm-hmm. - Okay. Hey, uh, do you want to know what Gill Turner said when I asked him about you? No, it doesn't matter. I'll ask him when I'm in the NBA. Thank you, Pete. - Yeah, take your lunch now, Jackie. - I got you, Pop. Hey, Jack, did you hear about Jackie boy here playing for the NBA? - Pipe dreams, Nick. - Pop, you know about that. I was wondering if I could get some shifts off, you know, so I could train? Come on, this construction site puts food on your table, not Dr. J. Yeah, I guess I'll catch up to you. How are you going to go? Twenty. - Marty. It's lunch, let's go. - Okay. - What's up? - What the fuck is the matter with you? If my dad catches you selling that shit, you're gone. Bro, your dad's been pissed off since Munsen died. I owe some guys some money from an advance, no big deal. Don't say I didn't warn you. - Help me make some money. - No fucking way. Just drop me up at the Y on 14th after work, alright. And Marty, use your fucking head for once. Alright. We gotta figure a way out of this thing. We gotta make some money, Jack. - What? - Fucking unbelievable. I'll figure something out, but I can make... Hey, what's up jerk-off? - What's up, fellas? - What's up? Joey tells me you ain't been paying your fucking taxes. It's news to me. Yeah, I'll give you some more fucking news, okay. One of our trucks got lifted. Cashmere sweaters and I heard they ended up in your fucking pocket. If I knew anything like that, you'd be the first to know. Scout's honor. Hey, Jackie, what are you doing still hanging out with this jerk off? He's gonna get you fucking hurt. It's a good question. I can't wait to bust your fucking head, you little scumbag cockeyed fuck. Little fucking ass face. Fucking ass face. You see what they look like? Fucking half-assed gangsters. Call them football street gangsters. You know what the joke's on them because I got a whole box of cashmere sweaters right here in this fucking trunk. You fucking idiot. - You trying to get yourself killed, Marty? - Come on. - Fucking... - You want to see 'em? Come on, give 'em to your family. Check 'em out. I guess I can give one to my mother, alright. Here, grab your shit. Fucking nice. Hey, dickheads. Don't take any action on the Mets. They're on a hot streak. I'm not taking the Mets. Benny took the Mets. - Where is he? - Benny's a fucking idiot. Damn, I don't think I'll ever marry her, so she's done. She's bluffing, Billy. Let me talk to her. No, Jackie. Just don't. You'll make it so much worse. And my baby girl's getting married. I don't know what lie she told him, but it worked. Drinks are on the Ryan boys. - Barrels. - Hello. Yeah, I'm looking for a guy named Jackie Ryan. - Hello? - Okay, can you hear me? - I'm looking for a guy named Jackie... - Who? - Jackie Ryan. - Hold on. Jackie, it's for you. - Yeah. - Can you hear me? - Who's this? - It's Peter Vecsey, you idiot. I finally spoke to Willis Reed, you know, with the Nets. - Okay. - I gave them your number. - You got a tryout. - Alright, yeah. - Yeah, sounds good. - You understand that? They're gonna call you. Alright. Yo, next round is on me. I'm going to the fucking NBA, baby. Uncle Jackie, mom said you're taking us out to get ice cream. I am. I'm gonna get you two scoops each, I promise, okay. I told you that he's a liar just like dad. - Dad is not a liar. - Yes, he is. Look, I just need you guys right now. I'm begging you, okay. Two scoops with sprinkles. Oh, my God! Just like that. You got that? You got that? Okay, let's go. Come on, just like that. Right there, right there, stay right there. Mrs. Burke. How you doing? Uh, is Jen home? Hi, Jackie. Look at these adorable girls. Oh, my God! I love my nieces, you know. Well, she's at Saint Cecilia's. Hey, congratulations on Suzie getting engaged. Thank you. We're very excited. We're gonna go. You have a good day, okay? Let's go. We're going to church. Come on. Yo, Jenny. J... hey, ball. Jenny. Her mom said she was here, huh? - I want to go home. I am bored. - Hey, hey, look at the magic basketball. - Ready? - I just want my ice cream, Uncle Jackie. I know. She said she'd be here. Jenny! Well, what's with all the ruckus here? Jackie, what are you doing here? I come here all the time. I teach Chrissy's kids how to shoot. No, we don't. It's a good girl. You tell the truth all the time. Go give the father a hug. Hey, guys. - Hi, Father Brennan. - Good to see you girls. Alright. - Who's this guy? - Who is this? He's just an old friend from the neighborhood. Some might say a local legend. Well, notorious is more like it. I got a tryout with the Nets. Really? - New Jersey Nets. - Well, congratulations. - Thank you. Alright. - Your dad will be happy. Yeah, I hope so. I'll go get the car. - Yeah. - Congratulations. I'll be right out, Travis. So, what do you say? Catch up like old times? It's been a while. Um, you know what, congratulations on the Nets, but um... I can't and I already got plans. - With the yuppie? - No, no. - Come on. - Come... he's a yuppie, Father. Come on. That is my father's lawyer and he's donating uniforms to the parish's boys club. Did you hear her say boyfriend? I... I didn't hear it, no. Father, I got a confession. - No, do not... stop, don't do that. - Get down, Jack. I've been waiting for this girl for six years to come back to the neighborhood. She just got back home. She's the most beautiful thing in Brooklyn and she won't go out with me. I'm about to be in the NBA. I want to celebrate her. Take her out to a nice steak dinner and I'm wondering if your, you know, professional opinion and all... that'd be something the good Lord would favor. Well, that I... I mean, it's up to the young lady not the Lord, in my opinion. I mean... come on, get down Jackie. So, you're saying she should give me a chance like Friday night? No, no, no. Don't go putting words in my mouth, now. Okay. Alright, fine. Just get down. Friday night? - Yes. - Phew! Father, thank you. Friday night. Friday night. Do not be late. I'm gonna be there with bells on. Well, you caved in pretty quick, didn't you? - What... - There you go, boys. God Bless you. Bless you. Bless you, Jackie. Hey girls, uh, give your mom and dad my love. Okay? Alright, bye. Thank you, Father. Hey, we got a date. Ice cream time. Ice cream time. Come on, Jackie. It's easy money. I'm not doing it. I'm training, alright. No more boozing, no more partying. I'm focused. Oh, you're banging Jenny, huh? Good. Hey, don't talk about her like that, alright? Oh, Mr. Sensitive. Excuse me for trying to get ahead for once. Yeah, well, I'm trying. I just got to pay back these guys their money. You think Gill knows I'm trying out? Hmm. Yeah, Gill's shaking in his boots right now. Hey, you know, you're gonna need an agent. - I could be your agent. - No fucking way. You're crazy. Oh, come on, man. I'll go get myself like a nice suit. I'll do my hair up real high. I'll be like the little miniature white Don King. Why do you owe these guys? - You're not supposed to be fucking with the Italians. - Yeah, I know. I know. - Remember the sweaters? - Yeah. I got a guy in the garment world who's been cutting me in on these irregulars. Turns out they're fucking stolen, now the Italians want their cut. - So, give it back to them. - I can't, Jackie. I already spent it. - Of course, you did. - Yeah, well. - Hey, Jackie. - Hey, kid. How you doing? - What's up, Billy? - Where you been? I clocked out early, sue me. You shouldn't be operating. I could smell the liquor from here. - What about from here? - Fuck off. Fucking. You fucking lay a finger... Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Hey! - Back the fuck up, motherfucker. - Hey, hey. What the hell... Hey, hey! - Walk it off! Walk it off! - Step back. What's going on? Eggplant here forgot his fucking manners. - I can fucking take him... - Fuck that. - Fuck that. - Jackie. Jackie, Jackie, what happened? Obviously, Billy had a little too much too early. It's no biggie. It's hot out. You know, it could happen to any of us. - Is that a fact? - Alright, everyone's going home. Billy, I'm driving. Will, come by the office tomorrow if you want to file a formal complaint. I mean, come on. What the fuck is that? - Watch your ass, Will. - Look at him. Listen, you heard Jackie. It's hot out. It's against the rules. You know that. It's gonna go on Billy's record. - Come on, it doesn't have to... - Come on. Ah, come on. Happy? Fucking asshole. Way to stick up for your family, but you don't ever throw your brother under the bus. So, you ready for the best pizza in Brooklyn? - Best pizza in Brooklyn? - Best. Best pizza in the fucking world. That's a bold statement. - I am starving though. - Yeah? - You? - Yeah, I'm starved. - This is it, huh? - This is it. Right here. I'm gonna go see Louie. - Getting to meet Louie. - Okay. Oh, my God!

You want pepperoni? - Uh, yes. - Pepperoni, please. - Pepperoni for her and cheese for me. Can you throw in a cold one, spot me? You spot me some Net tickets; I'll take care of that. All season, baby. - Good seeing you. - Good seeing you, kiddo. - Wow. - What? Did you put out a local press release? I got clout in this neighborhood, you know, they take care of me. Mm-hmm. Why'd you leave? Uh, because I could. Excuse me, here you go. Thank you, thank you, thank you. - Enjoy. - Thank you. - Thanks, Louie. - Pepperoni for you. - Um, I don't know. I, uh, I just needed to get out of New York for a while, you know. Open my mind. Huh, you sound like a hippie. No, no. My dad would kill me. So, am I doing good so far? I mean, this place is beautiful, right? Yeah, you know, it is by far the cheapest date that I've ever been on. But it's not going to be the last. I'm gonna tell you that right now. Did any of your basketball coaches ever tell you maybe you're just a tiny bit too cocky? Oh, every single one of them. Yeah, and I bet your Wall Street boyfriend can't do this. It's probably 'cause he doesn't want to. That's disgusting. I've been waiting six years to do that. - Mm-hmm, really? - Mm-hmm. So, how'd it stand up? Yeah, it was worth the wait. Alright, munch up. Enough of that. Let's test out this world-famous pizza. It's the best in New York. - Mm. It's the best. - Mm. Mm-hmm. - Told you. - That stands up. Jenny Burke. Come on, Jackie. Let's go, bud. Hustle. Alright, come on. Pick it up. You want to play with the big boys, you gotta hustle. Let's go. Go, Uncle Jackie. Go, Jackie. Fuck! You need to get it under a six-minute mile. You know I do a lot better when there's, you know, people watching. Mm-hmm. What you need to do is focus. Uncle Jackie's too fat. I am not. - He's chicken. - It's true. You gotta listen to them, Jackie. Why don't you get out here and run with me, you bum? - 'Cause I'd burn you, you Irish donkey. - Yeah, okay. Why don't you stop yapping and start running? - Yeah, exactly. - Why don't you stop being so beautiful? Alright, you ready? - Okay. - Go get 'em. Alright, pick it up, pick it up. - He's doing better. - He is doing better. Alright, alright, I see you. He's trash. Yeah. Now, get it Jackie. Alright, you get ten more seconds. - We're a team, baby. - Alright, you can do it. It's all mental. Come on, dig deep. Four, three, two, last one, last one. Oh, push, push, push, push. Come on, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up. - Come on. Come on. Pick it up. - Ah! Push through, push through. Time. Push, push, push. Pop, pop, move your legs. Alright, alright pass it. - That's all I need to do, right there. - There you go. No, that's not all. You need to work on your defense. Everyone knows you can shoot, everyone's gonna be looking for that. Thank you. Excuse me, ladies. Don't say it, I already know, alright. Just tell me that you brought the ID and the paper. The what? - The ID... - I'm just kidding. Come on. You are such a pain. Hi. - Hey, how you doing? Come on in. - Yeah. - Um... - How can I help you guys? Take a seat. We, um, sent over an inquiry about opening an account. Okay and, uh, what was the last name? Uh, Ryan. It's Jackie Ryan. Okay, Mr. Ryan. Oh, yeah. Oh, Ryan. Okay. So, Mr. Ryan, it says here you have, uh, no banking history and you graduated high school about 10 years ago? Yeah, I guess I never got around to opening up a bank account. Okay. Well, in order for us to issue you a credit card, we're gonna have to open an account. Oh, well, he brought his ID and, uh, a letter with proof of residency. Yeah, here you go. That's the ID. That info right there for you. Good, good. Well, that's good stuff, but, um, we're actually gonna have to ask for a 250 minimum guarantee because lack of credit history. See, I'm about to come up on a lot of money. You ever heard of the New Jersey Nets? Yeah, yeah. So did a lot of people, but, uh, I don't see how that helps us here in the bank. How old are you? I'm old enough to have a bank account myself. So how can I help you? Wow, look at this fucking guy. Forget it, alright, let's go. Anytime you guys want to come back, I'm still here. Absolute waste of time. Okay, well maybe if you wore a suit like I asked you to, he would have given you some leeway. These things matter, okay? I'm not wearing a damn suit, alright? And who needs a credit card, anyways? Jesus! Because, I don't know, I figured maybe a guy your age might want one. Oh, okay. Sorry I'm not no fancy pants lawyer. Look, your dad doesn't like me. He ain't never gonna like me. That is not what I meant and you know it. Look, I'm a ball player, right. If I want money, Marty gets it for me. It's just the way I like things. Okay, you know what, fine. I will not bring it up again. Jesus Christ! You are pain in the ass, you know that? Look, you just gotta understand, I'm not gonna let you down, alright. And all of my problems are gonna go away when I make this team. Mm. You say so. I'm gonna go work out with Marty, alright? I'll call you after? Mm. You know you're still gonna need a suit, right? They make you travel on one in the NBA. Now you're coming around. Now you're coming around. Those credit cards will do you in, Jackie. That's what they're fucking saying. Yeah, well the government can track you and shit. Listen, I promise, once you make it big, you don't gotta do this shit, you understand? 'Cause you're gonna make that fucking team. Yeah, if we don't get arrested first. - In and out, Marty, right? - Yeah, in and out. In and out. Alright, you watch the fucking door. I just want that cash register. Alright? - Let's go. - Let's go. Hey, you two. - Stop right there. - Ah, my knee. - Stop right there. Stop right there. - Fuck! Stop right there. Stop right there. - Get out of my house, fucko! - What the fuck is wrong with you? - What's wrong with me? - Fuck! I get a call late last night from a friend of mine at precinct 77 near Utica. He tells me that his son who's a beat cop just chased your monkey ass through Brooklyn. You know what I did for your mother, you miserable fuck? I lied to him. Yeah, I told him Jackie was here all night and God bless your mother, or I'd be taking your ass to the slammer myself. - Mom... - Well, did you do it? Is it true? No, no, no. You can't go crying to your Ma now, you loser. You cut your shifts. You call out your brother. Then you go drinking with your loser friend who sells drugs at my construction site. You don't think I know about that? Oh, he is fired, believe me. - Fuck this. - Oh, you don't pay rent! You come and go as you please. You got no responsibility left in you. - Fuck you, yeah. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, fuck you. - Oh, yeah, fuck me... I was never fucking good enough for you since I stopped playing football. - Oh, yeah. - I haven't done a fucking thing right. - So, fuck you! - Ah, ever since you got this tryout... Ever since you got this tryout, - you've been walking around like you're too good for this. - Fuck you. Fuck you. - Fuck you. - Hey, stop cursing in front of your mother. - Stop it. - Fuck you! - Both of you just stop... ah! - Get the fuck out of here! Fuck you, man. What did you do to her? You piece of shit, fuck you. Oh, yeah. You're an embarrassment. You're an embarrassment to me, you're an embarrassment to your mother and this whole neighborhood. I also got a call from Robert Burke. Don't go there. Don't fucking go there. You're not going to ruin that for me. - Yeah, you know what... - Just stop it. You're not gonna fucking ruin that. It's the one thing I got going in my fucking life. - You're not gonna ruin it. - Let him be now. You know what I told him? I told him you're a bum. You're a no-good bum, so take your shit and get out of here. - Just go, baby. - I hope you rot in fucking hell, Pop. I'll see you there. Take your shit and get the fuck out. And you forgot this. - I don't even fucking like you. - Here you go. Here you go. Oh, you forget your cowboy boots, cowboy. Here you go, those will look nice walking the streets. Jesus fucking Christ, Pop, that almost hit me in a fucking head. Susan, lock the door. Miss O'Brien, I love you to death, but the show's over, okay? Go, go inside. Get out of here, fucko, maybe the brothers will help you out now. Fuck, mother... that's it. That's it. Alright, there you go. - Go spinning... - You can pick those up. Go spinning your ball and do your tricks. Fucko. I didn't know what Marty was up to. I swear to God. Yeah, well if Marty goes to jump off a bridge, are you gonna go too? Doc, can you take an x-ray of my head, so my girl knows I got a brain, please? Oh, my God! Can you take anything seriously? Look, you are very lucky you didn't tear anything. But that being said, there's a lot of inflammation, you're gonna have to ice it for a bit. I gotta play though. I gotta tryout with the Nets. New Jersey Nets, you heard of them? I know, you told the receptionist. In fact, you told everyone on the entire floor, Mr. Ryan. - Unbelievable. - I'm excited. - Excuse me, I'll be right back. - Thank you. Thanks, Doc. Hey, there he is. Jackie boy, how are you, man? Alright, this is my buddy Jackie. Jackie, this is Isabella. - Hi. - How are you doing, Isabella? - This is Jackie. This is my girl. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah, Isabel. Do me a favor... - Nice to meet you. Get me, uh, two packs of Parliament and get me some... get me some quarters. - I'll see you at the party later. - Laundry day. Thank you. - Nice meeting you. - You too. Alrighty, it's my Dominican girl, okay? She's gonna bring a couple of hot models around here. We're gonna have a nice little party here. - Hey! - Yes. - You know I can hear you, right? - Uh-huh. Jesus Christ, Marty. You got to clean this place up. It's disgusting. And can you get rid of the booze 'cause there's no more booze for him and, you know what, no more booze for you either. What are you talking about? I'm not the one that's in training hopping the ball. Yeah, well, you're a bad influence and if you're gonna be his agent, - you need to get your shit together. - She's got a point there. You know, there's fat agents out there. I've seen them. Alright. - You like the place? - I love it. - Okay, those two top drawers are yours... - Uh, I'm gonna go, okay? - But I'll see you tonight. - Alright. - Thank you for everything. - Bye, Jenny. Where's my kiss? Awesome. She's looking good. Uh, those two top drawers are yours. Just do me a favor, stay away from this shit, okay? 'Cause people got dibs on that. And that's your bed. Good, you're gonna fit perfect. Watch it. Alright, listen. - What? - Here's what we owe, alright? Jesus! That's for you from your agent. Yo, I shouldn't be mad that Jenny wants to go to law school, right? The most important thing is she loves her job, right? Absolutely. And this freaking Travis guy or whatever his name is, he's just a family friend, you know? He's just trying to help her out. Yeah. You know what they say about family friends, right? Yo, you think her mother's ever gonna like me? Nah, it ain't happening. - I haven't missed yet. - Nice. I know. - That's your boy, Gill Turner. - Yeah. He's in better shape than you are. Yeah, I noticed. You gonna say something to him? Of course, I'm gonna say something to him. Hey yo, Gill. What up? Yeah, I know you, right? Yes, it's Blackjack from John Jay. Oh, Blackjack from John Jay. Long time, man. How you doing? I'm doing good. You know, killing it at The Cage, leading scorer two summers in a row. Oh, I didn't know they keep statistics. Hell yeah, they do. Yo, you should come down some time, it's a good run. I'll think about it. Yo, Gill. No offense, but uh, I wanted to tell you I was a little surprised you only averaged six assists a game last season. Scorekeeper had it out for me. Cost me two of my games at least. See, I told you they do that shit. Yeah, I've been watching you since your rookie years, still getting away with that stutter step, huh? That hesitation? Seems to be working. Not if I was guarding you. - Yo, listen. I'm gonna get back to my workout. - Yo, yo, Gill. Yo, I said that stuff 'cause I respect your game, you know. We used to go hard at each other back in the day. But that was a long time ago and a lot has changed, if you know what I mean. Yeah, but, look, I got a tryout with your Nets, Fitch wants to take a look. I'm wondering if you can put in a word. Look, what motor mouth here is saying is you're a local guy. You know how it is. Put in a good word for him. Sure, yeah, yeah. I'll see what I could do. We could always use a backup. This motherfucker said it. Alright. Let's go. Jackie, don't let him get in your head. Yeah, well, I'm not in his head. See the way he fucking looked at me? Fuck him. You know, you're the star and by the way, I got a pair of sneakers in there for you. They're brand-new. Check them out. You mind taking me to Jen's after this? Are you kidding? We got plans. What do you think of the sneakers? Any good? - Yeah, you fucking good? - What are you doing? What do you mean what am I doing? What are you doing? Hey, look. Let's go out and have a little fun. You've been training like a fucking animal. Let's go blow off some steam. - Yeah? - Yeah. Do a little blow? Ride that white lightning? What the fuck? This is for the Dominican girl. It's not a good look, Marty. Jack, you don't break my fucking balls, alright? - Like the sneakers or what? - I like... Alright, good. You know what fuck it. Alright? I've been working my ass off. - Yeah. - Let's go out tonight. - Yeah. - Huh? - Absolutely. - see what we can get into. Let's have a good time. Let's go. I'm gonna hit the showers. Alright, go ahead. - Some what? - Some art on the walls. - I like these walls. Fucking... - No. - Get off... - Give me a kiss. - Where's my cigarettes? - Yeah, you... Baby, I'm thirsty. Can you make me a drink? - What does she want? - Some sort of drink. Dude, you know where they are. The other one. - Grab her somethin'. What's your name? - Liz. Liz, Liz. Where you from, Liz? - Bronx. - Everyone... You can get the best pizza in Bronx. - Yo, baby. - I think I need like... it's just a siesta time. Yeah, I think so too. - This is like... - Take a bigger, bigger sip. One more big sip and we'll go to bed in a bit. There you go. Hmm. I'm so happy right now. Excuse me. Come on, Jack. Let's go. What do you want to do? - What do you want to do? - We got to get it. We got to get into the water. Yeah, we got to get into the fucking blue. Get in. Go, go. Oh, yeah baby. Come on, come on, come on, come on. First time's a charm. - Let's get boosters. - Let's go. - Hey. - You should wear the hat. Heehaw, motherfucker. Let's go. Marty. Alright, where are we headed? Fucking car smells like a turtle. What was her name? What was her name? Oh, fuck! - Motherfucker. - Mother... - No, it's not. It's not. - It's not? - No, it's not. - Are you sure? Where you going? What? Where you going? You wanted me to go by Jenny's house, right? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Which one is her house? Slow down. Right here. Right here. Right here. Right here. Slow down. - Move. - Hey, Jenny. Go, go, go, go, go. Get the fucking light. Go, Marty. Fuck, go. Old big Jackie Ryan, you're scared chicken shit. I knew you wasn't going to do it. In sports, free agent Gill Turner is in talks to re-sign - with the New Jersey Nets. - Turn that fucking shit off, man. - Not gonna hear it. - No, keep it on.

We gotta go. - Now? - Gotta go. I gotta change. Oh, man, it's not starting. What do you mean it's not starting? I'm going to tell you, if it's not starting, then the battery's dead. What do you fucking mean the battery's dead? Marty, let's go. Jackie, I'm telling you, we must have had the radio running all night, or had a light on or some shit. Oh, my God! Oh, I gotta change.

I mean, first you don't call me back and then you show at my house, drunk. I wasn't drunk, yet.

I told you not to hang out with that fucking thief bum. Fuck me, man. Ah. Okay, uh, I think that's enough. Jackie, come on. No, Jackie. Come on, let's save some of that for the fourth quarter, huh? Can you please do some of your basketball tricks? Can I do some of my basketball tricks? Of course. What do you want to see? Spin it? - Oh, well. - Well, I'll make you another one. Listen, I'm... I'm trying to be real classy here with the tie and coat, so I'll keep it short, but I just want to say a few words about my... my beautiful family. Well, as long as you're paying for dinner, huh, Pop? Actually, it's on me. So, don't remind me. Good time. But I want to share this one story. You know, Susan, she... she made lunches for the kids every day and everyone was picky. I mean Billy wanted baloney. Suzie and Chrissy, they wanted their PB&J's and Jackie just loved his fried chicken. But my sweet Susan, she didn't complain once, not once. She never complained about those late hours or raising the kids. You are the most generous, grateful, kind person I know. I love you with all my heart, pearl. I love you, too. I tell you my mom's drunk. But it didn't stop there. As soon as Suzie and Chrissy were old enough, they started helping out. When it was time for Billy to... to come alongside his old man and work right next to me, he didn't bat an eye. I'm a very lucky man. So, here's to my... my wife and kids. I'm gonna go congratulate him. - I'll be right back. - I think you can have some water. Pop, congratulations. - Sit down, Jackie. - No, no. I'm so proud of you and mom. I just feel bad for her, you know. She's got to spend every day with his miserable ass now, huh? Jackie, come on. Let's go, buddy. - Get the fuck off me. - Jackie, don't. You didn't waste one opportunity to take a shot at me, huh? Not one. - You piece of shit. - Come on, Jackie. Let's go. Get the fuck off of me. Floor seats. Floor seats. - That's what I'm going to give you one day. - Come on. Come on. - Keep dreaming. - Let's go. Come on. Look, he just hasn't been drinking in a while, okay? He's just dehydrated, okay? It's okay. Pizza's here. Pizza! Wait, you're not the delivery. Do I look like a delivery person? Well, Jackie made it to the NFL, so you have to wear these beads. You touch me with those beads, I will break your fucking wrist. Do you hear me? Jenny. Baby. Baby? Now you want to call me baby? Did you call me baby five minutes ago? - Are you out of your goddamn mind? - What? You're such a piece of shit, you know that? I'm done. Jenny, wait. Just wait, just wait. Let me talk to you for one second. Jeez, please, please, please, please, please. - Jackie, I don't want to talk to you right now. - I'm fucking sorry. I know you're sorry, but you know what, I'm so fucking pissed at you right now, but let me give you a piece of advice. Tell these people to leave and go to sleep. I can't tell them to fucking leave. I don't even know who the fuck they are. - People... - Why can't you fucking tell them to leave? Of course, you can't tell them to leave because you're the fucking life of the party, aren't you? And that fucking girl was grinding on me all fucking night. - I don't even know her fucking name. - Oh, my God! - The girl. - Don't even get me started with the girls. It's so fucking disrespectful. I sacrificed so much to help you out and you're throwing it all away... I'm a fucking idiot. I'm a fucking idiot. Why do you always fucking do this? I'm a fuck up. Again, I'm sorry. I love you. Please. Please. That's all I ever hear. Is you're so sorry. You're so sorry. You know what? I wish you the best of luck tomorrow, okay. Jenny. I'm sorry. Jenny, please. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, sorry. Fuck. Fucking idiot. Marty. Marty, I got to go. I got the fucking tryout. Get the fuck up. We're late. - Give me like 15 minutes. - Marty, get the fuck up. Stop, Jackie, my face is killing me. - We gotta go. - Oh, fuck! Just give me like 15 minutes. Marty, get the fuck up. We have to go. I'm late. Biggest day of my fucking life. - Come on, let's go. - When do you gotta go? Fuck you. Yeah, Pete. Uh, I'm not gonna make that tryout. Listen, I really appreciate everything you've been doing, okay. - I'm sorry. - Jackie, where are you? - I'm at the motel. - Stay where you are. I'll be right there. Get in. - Pete, I can't. I'm sorry. I... - Jackie, we got half an hour to get to Hackensack and I swear to God, if you blow this and embarrass me, I'll make sure the only place you ball will be your fucking living room. Get in, you degenerate. Nice day for a tryout. I... I know you're nervous. You've been running your mouth the whole month. Look at this fucking guy. He's a good ball player though, so are you. I mean I've been in this business a long time. You've got one of the purest jump shots I have ever seen. I don't know about that. Hey, you know what, you're lucky. You got a chance to fix a lot of wrongs. It's something most people from our neighborhood never get to do. You know, like, like me, right. Most of the guys of my age went off to Vietnam. I was in the Airborne Special Forces, but I never even left the country. Now, I get to write about basketball. You know, when I started at The Post, they said the NBA would never last. Now, look what here we are. Here you are. Hey, you know, you didn't have to give me this shot? I appreciate it. Ah, what can I say? I like an underdog. Come on, let's go. Hey, you got to sign in there. - They're asking for representation? - It's your agent. Look at that. Marty was right. Huh? Welcome to the big leagues. Alright, good morning fellas. Uh, I'm Coach Carlyle. This is Coach Johnson. Coach, uh, Fitch is on his way down shortly. In the meantime, I want to welcome you to open tryouts for the New Jersey Nets. Thanks so much for taking some time. Now, we're not expecting much, but we've been known to find a few diamonds in the rough, so I want to get you guys through some basic conditioning drills. I want to see what you do with our motion offense and then we're going to let you run up and down in scrimmage. We want to see you working hard and we want to see who can play. Now, it's one of those days, fellas. One of those days that could be the first day of the rest of your life. So, I'm gonna have half you on this side put on red jerseys, the other half put on blue jerseys, hit the locker rooms and we'll see you out here in five minutes for lay-ups. Two claps. Go. Hey. Well, Willis Reed says, "I remember playing with you, old man." - Oh, that's very funny. - Huh. Hey, who are those guys over there? Oh, just some European scouts. Guys looking to fill up their roster with professionals. Uh, I better impress them. From your lips to God's ears. Don't fuck up. Hey. Push everyone. That's it. That's it. That's easy. That's easy. Easy work. Come on, man. I've seen this match every time, baby. Come on, man. Light work, light work.. Okay, let me see that. Let me see that. - Come on. Let's go. - Where's the fucking offense? Play some defense. What's up, J, baby? If you guys don't run the offense, we're gonna be running fucking laps. If I say pass the ball in the post, pass the ball in the post. Move the fucking ball. And what the fuck are you doing? You understand me? Now, run the offense, Jackie. Jack Ryan, you want to play point guard in the NBA? I'm here. I'm here. Yeah, there's no fucking. Keep going. Give me the fucking ball. Hey, hey, hey. You, shut up. You're just happy to be here. Ryan, what the fuck are you doing? Motherfucker. Everybody, line up. Stay away from him. Hey, Malibu. Stay away from him. Alright, that's it, guys. Hit the showers. Except for you two. Baseline. How many, Coach? Until I say so. You kept the Irish kid around? Yeah, what can I say? I have a soft spot for him. They make an introduction. I like what I see. Yeah, our crowds would love him. Yeah, I'm sure, but he's, uh, he's not popping balloons for you yet. He's still mine. Let's go. Now hit the showers. I'll talk to you later. Alright, man. Let's... Oh, God! Ah! Motherfucker! - Coach! Coach! Coach! - You alright, Jackie? - Yeah. - Get the fuck off the floor. Let's go. Alright, Jackie. Motherfucker. Fuck you, motherfucker. Fuck you. You bullshit ass motherfucker, fouls every fucking time. Fuck you, Gill. You little bitch ass come back to the neighborhood. You little bitch. Fuck. Alright, Ryan that's it. You're done. Goodbye. Day's over. Hit the showers, dude. Okay, everybody else, let's get back to work. Let's go. Red ball coming down this way. Stay up all night drink beer, wake up, score 40 points like it was nothing. - Ryan, how's the knee? - It's alright. Good. Listen, I want to introduce you to Todd Davis. He owns a professional team. Harlem Wizards. Heard of 'em? Yeah, I know Speedy and Tojo. You guys entertain kids? Well, that's part of it. We are a professional team. We travel and we offer guaranteed contracts. Yeah, I appreciate that, but my, uh, my head's with the Nets right now. Yeah, I understand. But you hang on to that card and you think about it, okay? And, uh, Jack, when you're open, shoot the ball. Yeah, you got it, Coach. You know, I told the coach to take it easy on you. Yeah, I told them the same thing about you. Heads up! Don't think I forgot about yesterday? You know you're a disgrace to the fucking neighborhood, you know that? You got it easy, you know that? - I got it easy? - Yeah, you got... How do I got it fucking easy? You got it easy with your little bitch ass Rolls Royce. How the fuck you get a Rolls Royce? Look at your skin. Yeah. Coach. Listen, I... uh, I know you're hurt, but you don't seem like the type of guy that likes a lot of bullshit. I'm not gonna lie to you. I could use a little smoke blown up my ass right about now. Uh, well, you ever play in Europe? No, no. This was my first tryout ever. Alright, well, you didn't make it this year. Okay, but you don't need, uh, Vecsey to come back next year. I'm inviting you. Thanks, Coach. - Alright and good luck to you. - Thanks. And stay in shape and, uh, keep shooting. Always. Whoa! How'd it go? You look like a bag of shit. You look like an orphaned raccoon. Yeah, I tried to get you a limousine, but I'm not that type of agent. Yo, you missed the show I put on in there, man. Uh-huh. I see they left you with a fishing pole. Yeah, a cheap one. The guys at Faros want to throw you a big party. I'm good. I feel like a bum. Ah, come on. Stop it. Then we'll buy you a drink. I just want to see Jenny, bro. Ah, shit. Listen, do me a favor. Don't act like a jackass, alright? Why are you acting so nervous? I'm not acting nervous. I got seven pounds of weed in the car, okay? Just play it cool. Gentlemen. Hey, Officer. You know why I pulled you over? Yeah, I... I blew the stop sign. I'm sorry. I was just talking to my friend here. How you doing? You guys been drinking? No, absolutely not. What's going on with you two? What's with the face and the crutches? Oh, no. I... I got hit in the face with a basketball and, uh, he, he hurt his knee. He's a ball player. Let me see your license and registration. Hey, Jackie, do me a favor? Get my registration. Sit tight. I'll be right back. - Stop acting nervous. - Stop acting nervous? I'm gonna write you boys a ticket. Pay attention, alright. There's kids running around the neighborhood. - Right. - Alright? Alright, sorry, Officer. What? - Are you out of your fucking mind? - Relax, nothing happened. Are you a fucking idiot? - What'd you say? - You heard me. Jackie, relax. Okay? I was holding the weed to pay back the Dominican, remember? Oh, probably not because, you know, you became such a big shot. It had nothing to do with me. The Dominican shit was you, remember? Do you remember? Dragging me into that shit again! Wait, so this is all on me? It's always fucking you, taking me away from training, my fucking girl, anything positive in my life just to make your miserable ass happy. - Oh, wait so I'm the reason that you didn't make the team? - I didn't say that. Yeah, well, it sounded like that, Jackie. You know what, now that we're being so fucking honest with each other, you know what you are? You're a selfish piece of shit. Your old man was right about you. Don't fucking... Take that back, Marty, right now. Take that back right now before I beat your fucking ass. Take what back? What are you fucking fifth-grade? - I ain't taking nothing back. - Let me out of this fucking car. - I'm getting the fuck out of here. - You gonna walk? - Yeah. - Well... - Fuck you. Motherfucking... - With one leg? - Fuck you! - Well, good. Fucking walk. Fuck you! Fuck you. You're lucky I got one fucking leg, you little bitch. Fuck you. I got it. What's going on, Jackie? Hey, Pop. I got nowhere to go. Alright, well, you're gonna have to start paying rent now. Yeah. Come on in. He didn't make the team. Don't say anything. - I'm so sorry, Jackie. - Me, too, buddy. Their loss. Yeah, I'm sorry. - Hey, you alright? - Yeah. I'll talk to you about it later. I'm gonna go upstairs. He doesn't need your pity, alright? Don't start with me. I'm just getting him ice for his knee. Farrell, one more. Give me one more drink. Jackie. Hey. You done. I gotta cut you off. I need one fucking drink. Give me one more fucking drink. One more fucking drink. One more. Just give me... Hey, we're closing up shop. Come on, you gotta go. You're done. - Hello. - Hey, Chrissy, how you doing? So, you don't know what time it is? No, no, no, no. I know it's late. I'm sorry. I just wanted to talk to you for a sec, you know. What is it, Jackie? I want out, Chrissy. You know, I just want fucking out. What are you talking about? If I had any fucking balls, I'd put a bullet in my fucking head but I fucking care. Call Father Brennan. You should talk to him. I don't want to call Father Brennan. I want to talk to you. I want to talk to you right now. You're family, I want to fucking talk to you. I can't do this right now, Jackie. - Chrissy! - You're going to wake up the girls. Chrissy! Fuck! Fucking bitch! Shit! It's Father Brennan. Leave a message. God bless. Father, it's... it's Jackie Ryan. I could really, really talk to you right now, you know. So, if you could call me back, you know, the number and, uh... Alright, Brian, we're good. Oh, man. Oh, shit! Yo, Jackie. Show us some of them tricks, man? No. Not today, man.

Come on, you got it in you. - You want to see your fucking trick, huh? - Yeah. - You like that? Huh? - Yeah. Yeah. Does that get you off, huh? Motherfucker.

Yo, don't hurt yourself, man. Don't hurt yourself. Perfect timing. I just fixed it. Did anyone call for me? No, Jackie. - Baby, could you get some groceries for me? - Yeah. Don't you see he just got home from a hard day's work? Dad, I got it. I'm fine. I forgot to get salt and I need potatoes. - Okay. - Okay. - Jackie. - What? If you... if you want to talk to someone, my friend Annie, her sister is a therapist, it might be good to talk it out. Ma, I'm good. Alright. I... I shouldn't have called Chrissy the other night. I was a little fucked up in the head. I'm... I'm good. Alright? I love you. I promise you. Alright, he doesn't need a head doctor. He's gonna be fine once he gets his paychecks, money in his pocket, he'll feel great. - Get in the car. - Huh? - Get in the car. - I'm gonna drop these off to Ma. - I'm almost home. - Shh! Don't make me get out of this car. Okay, put on this tie. - What's this? - It's a tie. Do you know how to tie it? - Absolutely fucking not. - I'll show you. Is that him? - Yeah. - Alright, come on. You know my son Jackie? Hey, gentlemen, how you doing today? Uh, unfortunately, Jackie already knows what he needs to do in order to open an account with us here. Told you, Pops. It's always the same shit with this guy. Well, listen here, you little shit! I've been coming to this bank for over 40 years. You hear me? Long before you were even a glint in your daddy's eye, so don't talk to me about credit history. We're the Ryan family, okay? - Sir. - Do you understand that? Maybe, if you don't understand that, I should go talk to your manager - whose brother I've been working alongside for the past 20 years. - Sir, that's not necessary. That will not be necessary. Jackie, welcome to the banking family over here. Stephanie will get you taken care of on Sunday. Appreciate it. Does this mean I got a credit card? - Holy shit! - Thank you. Have a great day, Mr. Ryan. - Sorry, I get a little heated. - Yeah, it happens. Yeah, alright. Let's go talk to Stephanie. Stephanie. Farrell, you had me put it in. Are you fucking kidding me? The guy's down at half a hundred. Don't give him any more fucking action. We're gonna lose money here. You had me put it in and you don't like me to tell you. Hold on. Hello, Faros. Hi, is there a Marty there? Yeah. Who's this? It's Todd Davis. Yeah, hold on. What? You're fucking taking phone calls here now? It's for you. - Me? - Yeah. It's Marty. This is Todd Davis, owner of the Harlem Wizards. - Who? - Todd Davis. - I understand you're Jackie's agent. - Yeah. Yeah, I'm his agent. I'd love to have you guys here and come to speak to us about a tryout. - Sure. - We're here on 34th and 7th. Yeah, sure, sure, sure. I'm down there. - Tuesday night, 6 p.m. - Thanks. Farrell, do me a favor. I'll, uh, I'll settle up with you when I get back. Come on, baby. Ma, wait. How come there's no potato chips in the casserole? Oh, 'cause Chrissy's counting her calories. - Yeah, Billy. - What? What are calories? That's what make your mom look fat. - Hey. - Am I gonna be fat? I mean, you're not getting any skinnier. - What the hell is the matter with you? - You see what you start? - Seriously... - I don't care. - I just want the potato chips in the casserole. - Will you two stop? Nobody's getting fat, especially not your grandmother, magical princess. Easy, that's enough dear. Yeah. Hey, Dad. The doc told you you got to cut that out. Jesus, that's salt. And who made you Dr. Quinn all of a sudden? You know, Billy mentioned the guys down at work were asking when you're gonna come back. That's great. Jackie, it's true. I mean, the guys at the site don't care that you didn't make the team and we could really use your help. - Okay. - Well, come on, Jackie. Just say Grace so we can eat. Alright, thank God. Let's eat. Hello, hello, Ryan family. Oh, are you hungry? No, no thank you. I'm good. - What are you dressed like that... for someone? - You look like a clown. Oh, look. I'm selling insurance with my uncle. Uh, can we talk? Yeah, go ahead. It's a free country. Uh, I mean, you guys are eating. In private. Did you close the backdoor 'cause I got the AC on? I always shut the back door, Big Jack. - Come on, it's about business. - What kind of business? I'm not buying anything you're selling looking like a car salesman over here. Yo, fuck off, Marty. No, it's a business of me being your agent, Jackie. You're funny, Marty. You're really funny. Jackie, I'm serious on my mother. I got a call today from the owner of a professional basketball team. They want you to try out for them. Yeah. I got to work tomorrow. Jackie, go, come on. Come on, Jackie. Just go. I'll save your plate. Yeah, look. The past is the past between us. - You should do it. - Yeah. Hey, go ahead. Come on, thank God. The monk's gonna finally leave the monastery. I'll be at Faros, alright? - Thank you. Mwah! - Love you, Ma. Yo, so who called? What's going on? The owner of the Harlem Wizards. So, you think he's the real deal? Is he blowing smoke up your ass or what? You met him at the tryouts. Of course, he's the real deal, Jackie. Why else would I be here? Excuse me. Hey, hey, hey, hey. No. Not if I don't get my potato chips, you calorie count motherfucker. Are you kidding me with that right now? - Don't curse in front of the children. - I don't... it's not my fault. Ear muffs, baby, earmuffs. Don't you fucking curse in front of the fucking kids. What, you want to be healthy, huh, huh? - Here's some fucking green beans. - Oh, wow, are you kidding me? Mom! I just want the potato chips in the casserole. - What... how... - I want your napkin off the table. I can't believe I still live... Jackie, Jackie, Jackie, they think maybe... maybe a heart attack. He's gonna be fine. Hey, go get the car. - Okay. Go, go. - I... I need you to go with him. Go with him. I have to get the girls up. Baby, I'm gonna meet you at the hospital with the girls. Come in. - Hey, Pop. - Hey, Saint Peter ain't cashing my checks, so you girls can relax. Did the bank send you your credit card yet? - Yeah, yeah. I ran it up already. - Jackie. Yeah, can... can you go find your... your mother and your sisters. I... Someone stole my lighter and get the number of the cute nurse while you're at it. Sure, Pops. You know, they're putting warning labels on these things. Yeah. You can be a real asshole sometimes, too. Yeah, newsflash. You trying to give me a real heart attack? How do you feel? Damn, right. You know, when I was a kid, I dreamed of being a football player. And out of high school, I got drafted in the Navy. They sent me off to Korea. I was lucky enough to come back with two good knees. But my old man had other plans for me. No football, handed me a union card, drove me down to the piers. I had just served my country and he said, "They did you a favor." But that's the way he looked at life. I was gonna go to work just like he did, just like his father. Dad, I don't want that life. Well, what do you want to do, Jackie? I'm gonna stop being a fuck up. I want to make this basketball thing work for real. Well, sometimes what we want isn't a God-given right and you gotta make accommodations for reality. You gotta do something you love. And God must have given you this ability for some reason. You haven't seen me play in years. What the fuck are you talking about? Well, all I've been seeing is you walking around like a zombie and I hate it. Go make a man out of yourself. Come in. - Hey, Pop. - Hey. I found that cute nurse you were talking about. Ah, yeah. I was joking. It was for you. - Yeah, yeah. Come on, girls. Say hi to him. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, girls. How are you? Give me a kiss. Mwah! Are you okay? Yeah, I'm alright. Were you guys scared? - Yeah. - Yeah, well, I wasn't scared. - I told them that you are going to be fine, right? - Yeah, that's right. I'm gonna be fine. That you are going to look after yourself. - Yeah. Right? - Yeah. That's right. I'm feeling better already. What are you doing? It's my hair, huh? Jackie, get those smokes out of your nose. Look at Uncle Jackie. - Hey, hey, where's my lighter? - Hey! Where's my lighter? Jen, how you doing? I'm great. You? Yeah, I'm playing again. Yeah, you belong on the court. You're still seeing that guy? - How's your dad? - I'm just saying, if you weren't seeing that guy, - we could grab a slice... - You know what? Tell your family I said hello, okay? Wait, wait. I'm sorry, okay? I... I fucked up. I'm sorry. - You did. - I'm sorry. You should get back to your game. Hold up, hold up. Just hear me out. I regret most things in my life, okay? Mainly because I can't keep my mouth shut or my ego in check. But the thing I regret the most is the things I didn't say to you. You are the most important thing in my life and I miss you to bits. Guess what? I got a credit card. That's disgusting. Get a wallet. You look good. Yeah, I know. Yo, ball up. Oh, shit! I'm glad to see you're so relaxed. You got this in the bag, right? Yeah, well that's what dad said and he didn't fucking get the job, so... Hey, you've been on this site since you were 18 years old. They'd be lucky to have you as a foreman, remember that. I think I'm gonna ask Tammy to marry me. What? Yeah, we talked about it and I just think it's what's best for my girl, you know, and I just want to do good for her, you know. I really need this promotion, Jackie. Have you told mom and pops yet? I mean, mom will be doing cartwheels. I ain't told nobody yet. But I could really use a best man now. Are you serious? Yeah. I'm too nervous right now, Jackie. - I need to go smoke a cigarette, okay. - Go ahead. You know my brother's got this in the bag, you might as well go home. Mr. Olson. How you doing? What are you doing here, Jackie? I... Sorry to barge in like that. Do you mind if I sit down? - Yeah. Go right ahead. - Thanks. I know Billy's coming in next. That's true. Is something wrong? No, no. I just wanted to say that I really think he deserves this job. Well, you and I both know that he's a strong candidate, but, uh, he has some marks against him. I understand that. Uh, you see in my family, my dad says we're not management material and that's probably true for me and my dad, but Billy's different. You know, he's not perfect, but he's got the respect of the guys like no other, always been by my dad's side, he knows the business soup to nuts and I think your boss would be lucky to have him as a foreman. That's all I wanted to say. - Thank you, Mr. Olson. - Thank you. Appreciate it. Huh. We got a foreman in the car. - I can't believe he offered me the job in the room. - You deserve it, Billy. I knew it, I knew it, I knew it. Looks like I'm gonna be bossing people around now, Ma. Oh, I'm so proud of you. I'm gonna make you casserole with chips. Tell me, tell me everything. Olson called me after you left the room. He told me what you did. You're a good brother. You would have done the same thing, Pop. Not like that. Ah, that was touching. I mean, that was like a really, true Ryan "feeling me" moment. - I think, I think my... - Yo, what's going on over here? What are these guys doing? Where are they going? - You see this shit, Marty? - Well, they're in a hurry. Yo, where you guys going? Something going down at the park? Huh? What the fuck? You got the box? - Yeah, I got the box. - Let's go. Some shit's going down. Yo, Pop, we're going to the park, alright? - Alright. - Alright. - Thanks for the ride, Big Jack. - What the fuck? Yo, hit me. Let's go. What do you think about being back in this city, Gill? Man, I love the city, man, and I love the kids. Yeah? You looking forward to this season? Of course, man. - We winning everything. - Yeah. Get that. - Yo, where are you from kid? - Brooklyn, East 5th Street. - You on a team or something? - Not yet. - Gonna make it to the NBA? - Hopefully, I'll make it. Hopefully? Come on, man. Are they gonna let you run the floor? - Peter, let me run the floor? - Yeah. Of course, nigga. You know me. Starting point guard, baby. You know that, easy work. - You're gonna run that floor? - I'm running everything. I do everything, man. Can I quote you on that? Quote me on everything. Everything. I'm tired of being fucking the underdog, you feel me? Boy, that's Gill! Comes back to the neighborhood, what, once a decade? - Hey, yo, Pete. What's up? - Oh, hey. How are you? - Good to see you, man. - What's going on? Oh, we're just, uh, finishing up a piece on Gill. Thought it'd be a good idea to bring him back to the old neighborhood. You gotta be kidding me, this guy never comes back to the neighborhood. Hey, what up, Blackjack? Yo, Peter, you should get some quotes on him. No, thanks. I'm good. Hey, you know, Finch said you turned a lot of heads. Yeah, sorry about your tryout, man. You seem kind of shook. Is that right? 'Cause all I remember is busting your ass. We all know why you keep getting second chances, man? Easy, alright? - I put in the call. - Oh, yeah? We both know lots of black ass that'll bust Jackie's ass, but never get a second chance. Write about that, Peter. Well, I earned that tryout, alright? You ask anyone in this neighborhood. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. And I'm down here trying to be a good example to these kids. - Come on Jack, let's go. Don't even worry about it. - Jackie, we... - Come on, man. Was that necessary? - Yeah, it was necessary. Go, get 'em. Hey. Yo, Gill. One-on-one, baby. Me and you. I don't play for free. Yo, this is your neighborhood. Everyone plays for free around here, right? - Is that right? - Yeah. I will bust your ass in front of everybody. Ball up. Make them proud then, baby. - One on one. - Check, let's go. - One on one... - Ball up. - Go back there. Go ahead. - What you're waiting for? - One on one. - One on one. You might want to tell those camera guys to quit, you know, you're about to get embarrassed in front of everybody. - Come on. - Let's fucking... - Let's go, baby. - One on one. Hey, what's going on? Hey, your brother Jackie is playing Gill Turner at East 5th Street Park. - What, right now? - Yeah, right now. What the... - Are we going to finish our beers? - No. Let's go. Come on. You ready? Alright, good. Let's go, baby. Let's go. Come on. This is what you'll want to see? I'm about to bust this boy ass, boy. Ball up, motherfucking asshole. Come on, man. Come on, Gill. Everyone's watching. Game up. That's how we do it. Let's go, Jackie. Whoa, baby! Don't forget that ball, baby! Huh? Come on, hurry up. That's why you are having the lead, boy. What's happening?

Moving out, moving out, Gill. - Whoa! - Very nice. Jackie, you gotta play a little defense. Come on, Jackie. Come on, show him what it's like to be in New York. Come on. - Okay. - It's okay, Jackie. - Come on, Jackie. - It's okay. Let's go, baby. Let's go. What is that? What is that? That's a foul... There's no fouls out here, guys. We don't call fouls out here. - Give me the fucking ball, bro. - We don't call fouls out here, baby. - Give me the ball, bro. - We don't call fouls. Yo, you fouled me. - Do we call fouls out here? - Yeah, fucker, we do call fouls. You gotta be bleeding, baby. So, what's up, bro? What you trying to do? What you trying to fucking do, man? Get the fuck outta here, man. Get the fuck outta here, man. You can't hold me, man. You can't hold me. Too many weapons, baby. Too many weapons. Let's just go. Come on, Jackie. Right, Jackie.
