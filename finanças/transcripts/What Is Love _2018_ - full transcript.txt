Subbed by AP. Hope you enjoy! Hello. Hello. Is it Yamada-san? Is it convenient for you to speak now? It's convenient but What happened? I feel a bit sick. Really? Are you okay? Is it a cold? I think so. And I seem to have a fever I'm so dizzy I can't even go to a convenience store Then, it's serious. Yamada-san, if I mean if If you are still at the company and are about to leave. Can you buy something for me? I haven't eaten anything today. Coincidentally, I'm really in the company. And planning to go back. I can't help but I will help you once. It won't take an hour. Ok. See you later. Door is unlocked. Mamo-chan, are you okay? I will cook right away. um. Thank you. Yamada san, you don't have to do this. It is an easy thing. I'm pretty good at classification. Mamo-chan, Don't worry about me, please eat well. Excuse me. What's wrong? Excuse me, shouldn't you go back? Thank you. It's okay, I'll stay a little longer. I'm okay. Are you okay by yourself? I'm going to sleep, thank you Yamada san. Speaking of which, I don't know when. Mamo-chan no longer called me as Teru-chan. What is love? What? Really? Okay. You should take a taxi first. I'll pay for it. Get in from there for less than 2,000 yen. Not Koshu. You said you were going to Inakashika Dori. Turn left at Takaido housing complex. Ok. Turn left. Ok ok. See you later. Nakahara. Yes? Go buy some beer. Okay. This is for you. Thank you, Nakahara. Thank you. Beer for you. -Then I'm leaving. -Are you going back? Yes, next time let's drink at the bar with everyone. By the way, the door is unlocked. Yoko san said don't wake her up. It will be troublesome if you wake her up. I'm leaving. What happened? Why are you going back? Idiot. Here. Nakahara has gone back. What happened? I seem to have done something wrong, as if I drove him away. Leave him alone. but… Teru-chan, are you hungry? How to say this? I made udon for Mamo-chan, but I didn't eat anything. This is my mother's Chikuzenni. To eat What else do I say have a cold? Come to my house to cook. Who does he consider himself? And actually let the girl go home alone late at night. What is he thinking? Yoko-chan, I have to correct you. He didn't tell me to cook at his house. Mamo-chan said If it's convenient, buy me something. He has a high fever of almost 40 degrees. Of course I have to help him over Hey. You are so obedient to him. The relationship between your two is set. He will become more and more excessive. Here. I won't say bad things about him. But like that straightlaced guy, you should let go early. I'm gonna start now This Chikuzenni is so delicious. Do you want to eat the leaves? Still have enough, do you want? Sympathy seems to be a waste of emotion. Hey. Yes. Hurry up and come after eating. Ok. Good night. Take care of your body. Why is this? I'm not Tanaka Mamoru's girlfriend yet. -Goodbye. -Bye. Are you a friend of the bride? I'm alone. What? What's the matter? A friend of a friend. Me too. But it's hard to define what is a friend. Indeed. This is my first encounter with Mamoru Tanaka. Nothing special. It's just because they're party people. And we had a little intimacy. Here. Thank you. My name is Tanaka Mamoru. My name is Teruko Yamada. Then I called you Teru-chan. Then... I'll call you Mamo-chan. Sorry. Cheers. Cheers. I just thought that this man is really good. Every Friday, there is a 90% chance that Mamo-chan will contact me. In the past 5 months, I have basically fully grasped his behavioral pattern. Yamada san. Yamada san. Yes. Can you come for a while? Your part... Either mistake or late. You didn't do that before. I'm very sorry. Can you pay attention? Yes. -You have worked hard. -You have worked hard. You have worked hard. Everyone worked hard, we left. -Hard work, be careful on the road. -Hard work. To keep him in touch with me. I am used to passing time at the company. Of course, sometimes it fails. I'm digging in. Hello. Dinner ? I haven't eaten yet. I worked overtime today. I'm going home hungry. Yes you can. It's okay no problem. Then, I will contact you when I arrive. Yes. Thank you so much taking care of me. It's okay, did you sleep well later? Yes, I slept well. Order what you like, I'll treat you today. Really? Really, it doesn't matter if it's grilled crab or puffer fish. Is this really a puffer fish? Don't you think it's strange? You seem to have been busy recently. By the end of the month, But I'm not busy today. Is it? You have worked hard. But seriously, Isn't there a routine for the layout of magazines? So if there is no special requirement, I can go home on time without overtime. But since you have to do it, right? Yes. But the design is endless. I feel you see more thoroughly than others. Probably. I want to hang around too. I'll resign to be a professional baseball player when I'm 33. What? Didn't you say you want to be a carpenter building a palace? -A carpenter building a palace? -Yes -Did I say that before? -Yes. I can't do that. It's harder than the average carpenter. -Pro baseball player is not possible. -No. This common sense has been overturned. Let the child dream. You imagine. 33-year-old newcomer joins the group. What is this? -Have you decided on something? -Yeah. that… I want a vinegar pickled mackerel. A fried eggplant. Another bottle of shochu. Don't take a whole bottle. Why don't you just say whatever you like? But if you are too drunk, you can't go home. -Sorry. -Yes. -I want a vinegar pickled mackerel. -Okay. -One roasted eggplant. -It's fried eggplant. -One fried eggplant. -Fried eggplant. -One vinegar pickled mackerel. -Okay. -A bottle of beer. -Okay. And shochu with ice? -Then add ice. -Add ice. I have no idea what's so good about tofu skin. Just like the crust on the surface of hot milk. Yes. It's raining. Really? It's always morning before I accompany you. What did you call me out of? Why are you here? What? So cold. Yes. There is no taxi at all. Yes. Is it better to go by foot? Ok. There is one coming. Are you coming to my house? What? -Please go to Setagaya. -Yes. Good morning. Good morning. What to eat? Lunch. Do you have any plans today? Why? Wanna go somewhere? Hot? Thank you. So hot. Tasty. Nearly 30 in love. Doesn't start with the phrase "I like you and socialize with me". It started more naturally like this. I'm almost done. Oh wait. Since then, Mamo-chan has contacted me almost every day. When he calls, I will definitely see him. Add tomato sauce. If I miss the last train, I will spend the night at his. Crap. Mamo-chan. What time is it now? It's already half past ten. Are you going to work this afternoon? -I have to go. -I said. Do you want to go to the zoo today? Mamo-chan, don't you go to work? I've finished proofreading, I won't go if I have nothing to do. Come and wash it together. How about the strength? Very good. -Is it very good? -Yeah. So comfortable. I may quit the company. Why? Don't feel right for me. Really? Very good. Yamada san. Too free. free? You can have fun for one year. If I resign at 33, I will be an elephant breeder. This is more realistic than being a professional baseball player. Why? Why are you crying at the elephant? I am not sure as well. So funny. What happened? I just want to ask you. Mamo-chan, who wants to be an elephant breeder at the age of 33. Does he include me in his future after 33? I don't know why, the idea was very strong. That future scene is too beautiful. I can't help crying when I think of it. If I tell him this, he will laugh even harder. He would say "I really don't understand you." I may not live long. What? Does the god use my life? Let me have a good dream. You, don't talk about such ridiculous things. Look, that person is good. Really? Do you like that type? Didn't you say that muscular feeling can protect you? Did I say? What I always like is a thin Cute boy with a little hump. You are making up your own past and preferences. Do you need a reason to like someone? Likes or types. It's just a summary of the people I once liked. But a tendency to discover. The moment you like someone. I feel like he's in my heart. For no reason, Are you so fluttering? Is your job okay? You will be fired. Actually, my job is gone. What? You lost your job? Yes. What will you do in the future? Yoko-chan, you say Is work luck and love luck inversely proportional? I don't want to make my fortune worse. I don't consider the next job for the time being. You talk nonsense sometimes. It's better to think of marriage. I think it's better not to find a job. Have you all talked about this topic? I haven't talked to him yet. But I told him I might resign. He said it was fine. Very free free? By the way, have you started dating? Probably. What is it about? Yamada san. Just throw it away. I just came out for lunch. Thank you. -Thanks. -Thank you. Have you been here for lunch everyday? Roughly. You are silly. This time because of men, you were fired. It's not common now. What did he say? I am a bit envious of you. As soon as I see you, I think I haven't met anyone I really like. Maybe most people in the world can't meet the right person. Is it? But that's why The world will run. This is too bad. We are not living for the sake of the world. You really are a fool. "Like" or "It doesn't matter". I will be one of them. So except for those I like. Other people naturally become indifferent. How about you? I will get married next month. But I will continue to work. Marriage in this age does not mean stability. Clay pot, deep pot for two. Damn. Getting married. We should buy more beer. Let me buy some. No, I'm not saying I want you to buy. But don't you want to drink? I want to drink too. By the way, I will buy it. By the way Not by the way It's two o'clock in the night. It's okay. How many bottles? 1 bottle or 2 bottles? What brand do you want? You can tell me anytime. Please ask me. I have something to do, but help me. Don't be polite with me or worry about me. Then I'm going out. Mamo-chan, what's the matter? I have a meeting this morning. Sorry. Let's go out together. You go out now at 8 o'clock to the company. Aren't you going to work at 10? I am going early today. It's full schedule . What meeting? You didn't say this yesterday. If you want to get up early today, just tell me yesterday. Drink coffee as you want. Hey, can I sleep a little longer? I will lock the door before I leave Sorry, I don't like people when I'm not home. Didn't tell you before? Did you say? I did the laundry and cleaned the room before. You said nothing. Really? Then I said now, please remember. Do you want to know the content of the meeting? Our magazines are full of fancy text. Speaking of popular visual department pages. Some people say focus on the easy content of food special. Others say let young photographers do quaint street shooting. Now the two groups of people disagree. I haven't decided which one to choose. I let each of us at least come up with a new idea. This meeting starts at half past nine. So, I have to go to the company earlier. I have to come up with a new idea. After that day, Mamo-chan never contacted me again. Not to mention the future after Mamo-chan 33 years old. In the future, more than a month after that, I don't exist. Teru-chan, I'm going out now What happened? What does it mean? Didn't you ask me to spend the New Year together? That's why I came. I originally planned it this way. But people who took care of my magazine before had a party. The other person suddenly called me. What is calling you suddenly? What about Nakahara? What about Nakahara? If you're not there, he doesn't need to come. He has arrived. He has reached? You leave him alone. He's okay at home. He's not alone. My mother is here too. You're here too. I have to go please. Wait, you really go Excuse me. I'm so sorry, I asked you to come here. Setsuko san, this. Oops, is this a New Year gift? Thanks. Sorry for making you spend a lot. Junmai Daijinjo. Let's open? Open it. Opened. Open it. Oops. That child. If she is so obedient like you two. I can live a little easier. That's right. Yoko looks lively. No no no Her awkward personality is the most troublesome. When she went to kindergarten, We go to the department store to buy skirts. The shop is selling a cute polka dot dress. I ask her. Didn't you want that skirt? She said I don't want that at all. And then, she suddenly cried. I'm really not willing to be seen through her. But I went home without buying anything. This really sounds like Yoko. Right But I, Hope she can speak frankly what she wants. There must be something wrong with the way I educate her. This is delicious. Thank you. You are welcome. But that child is also very happy. So wayward but she made such good friends like you. Please take care of Yoko in the future. Good night. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Why did you make dumplings? Yoko-san said they all eat dumplings in China. What? I don't know. Please ask Yoko san. She is not here. Teruko san. Do you ever feel lonely? What? When drinking alone in the room at night? For a moment, I feel lonely. Yes. Wouldn't you particularly like someone to talk to you at that time? For example, TV is boring. Touched a puppy or something today, right? Yes. I I hope I can be found whenever Yoko san lonely. To be extreme, it doesn't matter that she doesn't come to me every time. When she couldn't find someone. She can suddenly think of me. That's enough. Nakahara, you are disgusting. -Really? -Yeah. Really, I want to be beside Mamoru, What? If I can, I want to be beside Mamoru. Otherwise, it's okay to become Mamoru's mother or sister. No, cousin is okay. You are more disgusting than me. How do we feel like we are having a follow-up league review? What is it? So close. Yes. I want to be happy. Just Want to be happy. Yes. Until the spring arrived, Mamo-chan did not contact me. Guest experience. Some look okay. Yes, I used to work part-time as a student. Is it? There will be more new guests during this period. Hope you can treat them carefully, I understand. Can you work on weekends and holidays? Yes. I used to be a customer here ... Sorry. Sorry I won't do it. What? Sorry Wait a minute. Hey. I'm not free. This is Teruko Yamada, this is Tsukakoshi. -Good evening. -Hello. Sumire is such a good name. Really? Thanks. What do you do? I am the administrator of the art tuition school. Administration of Tuition School? How did those two meet? Is it the end of last year? November. We became friends, isn't it funny? Malibu was a tuition student. They said I didn't have enough people. I went and we met. I was forced to pass by a part-time student in the editorial department. The people present were basically around 20 and nobody cared about me. Too much. I'm 34 years old and I'm 35 at the end of this month. Definitely the oldest one. If Tanaka is not here, I'm really upset. Thin sliced ​​sea bream. Wow, looks delicious. It's awfully delicious, if you look at this real snapper, you will cry Cried. -Cried? -Cried. So delicious. Tofu. Really, So delicious. Teru-chan what do you do? I don't have a job right now. Really? Amazing. Teru-chan, you eat too. I can cry I can cry -Can you cry? -Can you cry? I can cry I can cry I will cry, right? Cried. Cried. Yeah cry. Sorry, I want to go to another stall with my friends. Goodbye. Say goodbye. Bye. Please be careful. Then, I will leave from here too. Why did you call me out today? There is no special reason, but it's been a long time. I want to talk about drinking together. Did I bother you? Not at all. Is that your girlfriend? Could it be a party for a girlfriend? Do you have a girlfriend? Don't you call me again? I didn't say that. I I fear you most. No no kidding. You are too occupied in your inner thoughts. Or do you think it's good. Sorry. You see Sumire san right? That nervous woman, she wouldn't worry at all. Then I will be easier. Bye -Please go to Setagaya -Yes. Tsukakoshi Sumire Who is that woman? Tsukakoshi Sumire Crumpled underwear Internal organs A constipated face A cigarette addict Black lungs and corrupted liver Dry back uncomfortable. But my body is too stiff. Tuition students discuss fancy dress and gossip. Deception with the boss was also exposed. But ignored. Buy plants immediately wither. The wreckage of plants on the balcony is too sad. After winter cockroach eggs hatch in spring. Itchy back Deserve it I I fear you most Deserve it Small photo Teruko Teru-chan Here I am I'm really angry about this. Look down on you. I'll be reminded of my dad when I hear something. Your dad? I tell you. My mother said it before. Is it? Then she said it was dad. For me as a kid, it was just my uncle who came to the house occasionally. The guy showed my mother the pictures of his own children's games very indifferently. I wonder why he didn't die. So cruel. Yeah, he looks down on my mother. You can't do that because he look down, don't you? My mother too. For the kind of man who doesn't know when he will come. Usually prepare a can of beer. Although he doesn't come often. Tasty? Your advantage is No matter how desperate, you will still be hungry. I'm not kiddin g about death. I can't see Mamo-chan because he died. You are not an incredible lady. In short, we must maintain physical and mental health. Eat well and work hard. Then, Yamada Teruko. Yes. Future dream. My future dream is to become a kindergarten teacher. To be a good teacher loved by children. I want to speak. The first thing I thought about when I was looking for a job was to have enough time with Mamo-chan. I will never be a kindergarten teacher. Hey, don't stop. Yes. I'll make one for you, too. unknown number Hello Sumire san? what happened? Teru-chan here Sumire san Sit there -Good evening. -She's Teru-chan. Teru chan. Cheers Where are you from?

You can live there for a day or two, Then we can go, Tanaka says he has a villa, Really? When? It's not mine. It's my friend's parents. But you can borrow it. How about next week or end of the month?

This is my first time getting off at Nakameguro Me too I'm fine if I don't go there. But I won't go anywhere. She said she hates ambiguous relationships. Sumire san? Yes Do you understand? I don't understand. I think you are the kind. I I'm not handsome. Not very fashionable. Physically a poor acid phase. The word sour is very fresh. Not gentle and considerate. No money. Am not particularly good at work. Although I don't want to admit to being rustic. But if men in the world are divided into handsome and not handsome, I think I must be handsome. Then Then Why are you To be good to this kind of man? Am I kind to you? Isn't it the same today? You call me here. That's because Does "I like you" a good reason? What I want to s ay is that I have no place to be liked. Yes. I think so. You obviously have nothing to like. Strange What did you say? Hey You speak too plainly, I'm a little upset. Right It hurts. Does it hurt? Not fun at all. Why? It hurts. what happened? I said, Why are you hard now? Sure enough because I drank at the bar. You are really charming. What does it really mean? You have nothing to love. Surely chasing Sumire san is impossible. Probably Exactly That's why.. Just let me be your girlfriend Stop chasing Sumire san. Yes How to do? Do you want to? I do not know. Whatever then. Ok I will never forgive them. Forget it. A rare visit, let's get up. Let me marinate the meat. I'll go as well. Nakahara charcoal. Yes. Mamo-chan rented a seven-seater car. But who actually came Their friend said. Is it today? I'm sorry I can't go. So Sumire san was released. I only borrowed the villa keys from my handsome friends. Mamo chan who has no appointment. In fact, he just wants to be alone with Sumire san. And thinking about a rare trip. Enjoying the summer. When I make an appointment. We happened to discuss. Why did that guy hit a 30-year-old woman? You have to let us go. But I will definitely be happy when I go. Then you go with Nakahara. What? Why can't you let Teru-chan go alone? Come. I can't go. Just go. No I won't go. Ok I will go. Nakahara who was forced like this. Only four of us. It is done. Here. Nakahara, are you a photographer? No, I'm just an assistant. Then you will have a lot of cameras. Yes Is it too much? How many? Three. How many? Three -This is not much. -What? Nakahara, are you funny? How many are too many? About four. Roughly the same. No, three and four are completely different. No no no almost. Much worse why. -Almost. -It's a lot worse. -The meat is ready. -The dishes are ready. -Thank you-Tanaka, listen to me. What? Nakahara is so funny. -Hey, hey. -Not so funny. Very funny. -Not so funny. -Very funny. -Not fun. -Listen to me. He said he has a lot of cameras. -No no -I asked him how many He said there were three, I said four.

Finished cooking meat. So hot So hot My tears come out. So hot. Shrimp is so fragrant. Did the chicken wings eat? I have not eat yet. Then Last burned Will get happiness Ready Start Burned What? Isn't she your girlfriend? No, she is not. Calling her girlfriend unilaterally, I'm a bit scared. What's the matter? No. Isn't there a relationship that only they both understand. Right? What? but… She is calling for you, right? What does this woman think of you as a spare tire? What you said is like Yoko san is very stubborn. Obviously, she's very shy. Right To be honest, you sleep together. Right? Very strange. Am I saying this strangely? No no No but… Yoko-chan is really a good woman. Talk to someone like me. I I think this is good. You'll be content if you can date? No, it means ... Really not like you said. What? Why are you laughing? I am seriously thinking about your future. No, you won't understand. Why are you talking to me like this? No, Yoko san is not bad. She is bad. Judging from what you say, she is bad. You are right. What? Yoko san is a bad woman. Ok stop. Tanaka. How? What is this guy doing? Just ... Not everyone can say the word "like". There are also people who really like someone but can't say it. As long as they think it's okay, right? Right? Nakahara. Yes. I'll make pasta. All I can do now is to make pasta for Nakahara. I don't understand you at all. What happened? Tanaka? Where did the knife go? You don't need a knife for pasta. No, I have to cut the tomatoes. We didn't buy tomatoes. -Found it. -Found it. Hey there are asparagus. Nakahara. There are asparagus. Dangerous -You wash this. -No, it's not asparagus. -Why wash it? -It's not asparagus. It's asparagus. It's green. Forget it, don't force yourself to eat. Nothing left. But it's wasteful. Teru chan Do you like Tanaka? Why did you ask so? What do you like about Tanaka? Just ... What do you mean? I don't like that type. Although he did a lot for me, But in fact they are very selfish. -Selfish? -Yes. They care about each other before dating. But once you formally interact, they are reallt self-centered. What do you mean? This is my ex boyfriend. Like when dating. I am hungry. Then I said I'm hungry He said I'm not hungry. But when he said hungry. He doesn't even care about me. What? Is that just the case? This kind of thing doesn't matter. I do not mind. It matters. Ordinary people can't bear it. Is it? So actually Tanaka is more suitable for dating with a girl like you. Did he tell you? Just ... Did he confess to you? Yes. Really? No no no True or false ... No no no no Really? Do you like him so much? Really not. Sorry sorry. Really he did not confess. After traveling, Sumire san often contacts me. Every time I call Mamo-chan. Mamo-chan also contact me from time to time. Every time at the agreed place, Sumire san is also present. But don't know why I don't hate her. -Good morning. -Good morning. Yo Hello there What are you telling me? Just I plan to no longer like Yoko san. We should never meet again. And I should never see you again. So I want to have the last ramen with you. I do not understand at all. What do mean by "No longer like"? Just ... I've been thinking about it since the last trip What to consider. I am sorry that I like Yoko san. I do not understand at all. At that time, Mamoru said As long as we both feel okay and then then I think it's OK. But I think about whether Yoko san feel okay and also Sumire san said so unbearably. Don't care about Sumire san. I dumped Yoko san first. I suddenly remembered. Have you heard the story of the Chinese emperor? Emperor? A court who cannot disobey the emperor. Accepted all the rude demands of the emperor. Then the emperor got more and more excessive. I can't tell whether these requirements are cruel. then I always thought the cruel one is the emperor. But in fact Are the obedient subjects more cruel? In other words, I don't understand. What exactly is love? What? What is love? What is love? You You are just scared. I don't know where I am on the bottom. Didn't you say I want to be her existence when I am lonely? That's enough. I want to understand. It's always lonely, someone like me and you. Yoko san is not. That's why we are close. No, Yoko san is lonely. Is it? Of course You are making excuses. If you can't get anything, you just give up. You are right. It's okay if not me. Anyone can do it. To be honest I have had enough. That one… I really like Yoko san. -Then ... -Enough. Enough There are many gaps between us. Letting go of such things gives me the freedom to make decisions. I should be going. Glad you could come. You're so dumb. Nakahara I want to be happy. Shut up. Idiot. Yo Yo Have you changed your hairstyle? Yes Someone from the editorial department I know. Say I should fit this hairstyle. What do you think? Is it a man? Yes. Where is Nakahara? Nakahara? We haven't met recently He doesn't come to call. Mom, Teru-chan is here. Have you eaten? Won't you come in? I said Do you think it is okay? what? Do you think it's okay not to contact Nakahara? Why did you say that? Moreover, You treat Nakahara too casually, right? He is so pathetic. I blame you. Let him go on that inexplicable trip. Why don't you treat him better? How can it be me? The person who made the first appointment is you. But you let him go. -He decided to go by himself. -Your responsibility is negligible. What do you think of Nakahara? He likes you. So? and so? So you are too scum! You are to Nakahara, just like your father did to your mother. what? Where is the same? Why should i be like my dad? Don't confuse me with him. -What do you know? -I don't know. I don't know, but you're not good at all to Nakahara. Let me tell you. Don't just let out on others because you and Mamo-chan are not going well. -You just think of Nakahara as another one. -What are you talking about? I do not have Don't you want to be cherished by Tanaka? To be loved by him? No, we are not talking about me now. So why are you here? If it's for boring guy, then please go back.

She said that I wanted to see you like me And just playing you When When did she find you? Just recently Maybe Nakahara told her -That's it. -Huh. To be honest, I never thought of this before she told me. Never thought about your feelings. After that I thought about it With a girl like you by my side.

Do you think I will always like you? You're pretty good I did like you before. But this is also because you often ask me to meet. I thought you liked me, so I was a little bit worried. If someone likes me, I will like him too. I don't know what happened. But I have long been disinterested in you. Is it? When traveling What's wrong with Yoko? You said you were going to introduce me to the handsome guy who owns the villa. I haven't been there yet. So awkward. I didn't say that because of narcissism. That's what Yoko-chan said. I think so. It turns out ... Too awkward. Really is but I feel relieved. It might be a bit inappropriate for me to say this myself. But I have no friends. I don't have anyone like you. It feels just right. Great Great You do not like me. Yes Then you quickly introduce that handsome guy to me. Then add Sumire san, shall we four meet? We help each other. We are not lovers. Don't say such silly words.
