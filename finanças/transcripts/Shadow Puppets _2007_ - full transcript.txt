(suspenseful music) (screaming) - Does anybody hear me? Anybody? Let me out of here. Open this door. Think. Come on think. (monster growling) (monster screeching) (suspenseful music) Hello. Hello. (suspenseful music) - Get me out of here. Please. You gotta help me. Is it gone? - Is what gone? - Whatever went tearing down the hallway. - You heard it, too? - Damn right I heard it. I don't wanna be around when it comes back. - You know your door wasn't locked. - It wasn't? - The blackout must've done something to all the locks. - What's your name? - I don't know. - I don't know mine either. - I can't remember who I am or how I got here. - I seem to be having the same problem. - What's the last thing you do remember? - Waking up in that cell. - Me too. My entire life before that moment is blank. - Well at least you look better in your underwear than I do. - Thanks. Any idea where we are? - Not a clue. That's really gotta stop. - I didn't think this place could get any creepier. - You know, if the lights go out, we'll be really screwed. - As opposed to now? - Good point. So. You ready? - It's cold out there. - Someone's coming. - Dead end. - Guess we go the other way. - Those cell doors are open. - Hello. - Is anyone there? We're just looking for a way out. - We're here. - Who's we? - Just me and a woman. - You got names? - I'm sure we do but neither of us can remember 'em. - Join the club. - We can't remember anything either. - And that doesn't scare the crap out of you? - No, it does. Very much. - But we're just trying to focus on getting out of here. - And where do you think here is? - From the looks of it probably some kind of prison or mental hospital. - Sorry we didn't answer before. We thought you were guards. - You've seen guards? - We haven't seen anyone. - But we've heard some pretty crazy things. - So did we. - Well whatever's happening, I see we all have the same tailor. - She's a little touchy about being in her underwear. - No, I'm a little touchy about being in it around you. - I think our attire is the least of our worries. Is there a way out down there? - I don't know. Up until that last power surge, we were locked in our cells. - So what do you think? Me and the kid locked in or out. - You two check down there. We'll check this way. As soon as one of us finds the exit, then we'll worry about how to get this gate open. - We're splitting up? - Don't worry. As soon as one of us finds something, we'll meet back here. - Okay but if you find the heat before we do, will you please turn it on? - We will. Although I'd settle for a jacket. - Hell, I'd be happy with a pair of pants. - Be careful. (soft music) - Someone really wanted out. - Or in. (soft music) - What do you think happened to everyone? - I don't know. Whatever it was, why didn't it happen to us? - Who says it didn't? (monster growling) - This is all wrong. - You're just figuring that out now? (suspenseful music) - Ladies first. - You've gotta be kidding. I'm not going down there. - We don't really have a choice, do we? - Yes, we do. - What? Run and go back to your cell. (suspenseful music) - There's no way. - Fine. You stay here. I'll check it out. (suspenseful music) - What is all this? (suspenseful music) - I think it's some sort of sensory deprivation room. - Fun. - Not if you were locked in it. - Remind to take that off my to do list. One of these is marked temperature. If you'd like to warm up in there, I'd be happy to stand guard. - No thanks. I'll take my chances with the cold. (monster growling) - Are you sure about that? (suspenseful music) - I hope the others are okay. - Despite all this you still care about people you just met? What do you think you do for a living? (knocking) - That's a new sound. - A little less scary though. (soft music) - Did you find anything? You found a naked girl swimming in the pool. - And you were scared to come down the stairs. - You don't think this is a little strange? - Oh no. I do. - Why don't you two stop hiding and come join me? - Where are you going? - To talk to her. Hi. - Hi. - What are you doing? - Swimming. - I see that. Do you know where we are? - No. Do you? - No. Doesn't that scare you? - Should it? - What the little pervert is trying to say is why are you swimming here? - Relaxes me. - Do you know who you are? - No. Do you mind turning around so I can get dressed? - No, of course. - Passionate, aren't we? - Did you see that? - See what? It's not like she's wearing much more than she was before. - Leave the poor kid alone. He's just scared. - And you're not? - What's there to be scared of? I already know what's going to happen to us. - And what's that? - We're all going to die. (suspenseful music) (monitor beeping) - What the hell happened in here? Careful. He looks in worse shape than the room. - Well he's still alive and I think he's brain dead. (monitor beeping) This machine was used eight times. - Do you know what it does or did? - No. Whatever it did, it was irreversible. - You seem to know a lot though. How is that? - I'm not sure. I just know. - So our skills are still intact even if our memories aren't. - They use a different part of the brain. I don't see any wounds on him, which means someone did this to him before whatever happened happened. - Here we go. That'll let you look the part. - Thanks. See what else you can find? You never know what we might need. - Was thinking about a weapon myself. (monitor beeping) - What about that tray? - Oh yeah. Oops. - Well if no one's coming now, no one's coming. (suspenseful music) - Nothing. (dramatic music) - You move and she dies. You not gonna do to me what you did to him. - No, we didn't do anything. - Shut up. - Just put the scalpel down and then we can talk. - I want answers and I want them now. - We all want answers. - Look at what we're wearing. Look at what you're wearing. We're all on the same side. - I just wanna know what the hell is going on. I can't remember anything, not even who I am. - We can't remember either. If we wanna get through this, we have to work together okay. Please. Please. - I woke up like this alone in a cell. When I heard you two, I thought you were the ones who did this to me. - You got the wrong two people, my friend. - It's okay. We're all scared. - What about him? - We found him like that. - What were you two doing here? - We're just looking for a way out. - Oh I found a way out. - You did? Where? - You keep going down this hall a little ways, you'll come to a security door, but it's electronically locked. I tried to break it open but it was no use. - We heard the banging. - That was me. - That doesn't explain the other noises. What about them? (soft music) - [Both] Ah. - Ah. - Ah. - No, no. - We need to help him. No, no. - We gotta go. Now. Go. Go. Come on. Go. We need to hide. - Not in there. Not in there. - It's right behind us. (monster growling) - It's coming. Come on. What the hell was that? - I don't know but I think it's gone. - It killed that man. Why didn't it come in here and kill us? - What are you complaining? - Oh no. Are you all right? - Oh, it's not bad. - Let me see it. Scalpel. Do you still have it? - Yeah, yeah. - Hold on. - I see you've done this before. - You're probably right. I wish I could remember when though. - Maybe the others had better luck than we did. - I hope so. For their sake. (soft music) I think it's safe. Relatively speaking of course. - Let's do it. - Where do you think these stairs go? - Down. - Funny. (soft music) - You up for a swim? - Maybe later. Padded cells, a hospital room and a pool. - Don't forget the sensory deprivation room. (soft music) - This towel's still wet. - That can't be good. - No it can't. - Ah. - Wait. She's with us. - Damn, you scared us half to death. - What were you guys doing in there? - We didn't know you were you. - I'm getting tired of people and things grabbing me from behind. - I'm sorry. Next time I promise to grab you in the front. - Who's this? - We met her at the pool. She's just like us. Doesn't remember a thing. - It's a pleasure to meet you. - Pleasure's all mine. - So, how'd you guys do? - Has she tried to kill you? - No. - Then you did better than us. - What happened? - We were attacked by some sort of creature. - What do you mean creature? - I don't know. I can't explain. It was like the shadows came off the walls to kill us. - I know it sounds crazy but it's true. - Listen to yourselves. The shadows attacked you? It's not even possible let alone sane. - Possible or not a shadow killed a man we met. A man without a memory just like us. - I told you we're all gonna die. - Will you attempt to stay positive here? - So, I take it then you didn't find a way out of here. - No but the man we saw killed, he said he did. Unfortunately, he also said it was electronically locked. - I don't even know if he was telling the truth. He was a little nuts. - Unlike you. - Even if there is an exit up there, that thing is up there as well. - Well then I guess you're gonna wanna look for a way out down that way. Come on. Follow me. (soft music) - I don't trust her. - Well unless the shadow starts growing claws, I don't think we have to worry about her. - It actually already did that. (soft music) - Come on you guys. She's one of us. All of these corridors, they all look the same. - Down that way is the room I woke up in and down there well see for yourself. - I don't know if this is such a good idea. - If there are any people down there, they probably need our help. (suspenseful music) - It's about damn time. - Do you know who you are? - That's a stupid question, doc. Do you know who you are? - No. None of us do. - Well that makes us all one big happy family. So you gonna get me out of here or what? - You are not gonna let him out. - Why shouldn't I? - 'Cause he might be locked up in there for a reason. - Same thing could've been said about you. You sure about this? - Yeah, she's sure about it. - Shut up. - Yeah, I'm sure. We're all in the same boat here. (soft music) - Thanks, doc. - Why do you keep calling me that? - Well, you got a lab coat on over your underwear. You either a stripper or a doctor. Works for me either way. Can't complain. (soft music) - That's disgusting. - I've been chained there for hours. What? You never had to go? - I'm assuming you don't know where we are either. - Well judging from the bars, I guess some kind of prison and seeing as we ain't got no clothes on, I guess it's that we're not the ones running the place. - That's just it. We haven't found anyone who's running the place. - Maybe it's like you said before and this is a mental hospital and we're the patients. - Yeah that's what I think. - And somehow, something happened to the doctors and we all got freed. - You think we're mental patients? - Let her go. - Mental patients don't shave their legs and they sure don't have bikini waxes. - Bastard. - I knew we shouldn't have let you out. - Oh relax, kid. I'm not the one you need to worry about. It's her. (dramatic music) - Who's in there? - Judging from the looks of that cell, obviously somebody far more dangerous than me. - Keep an eye on him. - With pleasure. (soft music) - There's a girl in here. - What are you doing? - I'm going to get her out. - Don't do it. - I have to agree with him on this one. - Sorry I don't. It's okay. I'm just gonna take the mask off. Okay? - Oh my god. I didn't think I was ever gonna get out. - Hang on. They got you in here pretty tight. - I don't even know how I got here. - Your friend's a pretty brave woman. Can't say the same for you, big man. - [Skinny Man] Don't even think about moving. - [Tall Man] Oh well you couldn't take me with two hands much less one. - The shadows are moving. - We have to go. Now. - Oh no. - What's the matter? Big man with the scalpel is afraid of his own shadow? - Only when they trying to kill me. - Come on. (suspenseful music) - Hurry. - Get them out of here. - What about your girlfriend? - I'll get her. - Come on. Get out. Let's go. (suspenseful music) (monster screeching) - She's still in here somewhere. She's still. She's still in here somewhere. No. - We are leaving. Now. - No. No. No. No. No. Ah. - Wait a minute. - I couldn't save her. - No, you can't save everybody, but I promise you, you and I are gonna get out of this together. All right. - We're all gonna get out of this. - Down here. Hurry. (dramatic music) - [Brunette Woman] Get off me. - What the hell was that thing? - That was the shadow creature you said didn't exist. - It's not possible. Maybe we really are crazy. - We're not crazy. At least not all of us. What's going on here? - [Tall Man] She left and then that thing came after us. - It was as if she knew it was going to happen. - Why'd you leave us? - I didn't realize I needed permission. - You don't. Release her. Let her go. - Whatever you say, doc. Somebody knows something about all of this. - It's going to kill us all, you know. Just like it killed everybody who worked here. - I thought you weren't scared. - No, I'm not, even if we are crazy. - If it killed everyone, then where are all the bodies? If it didn't, then where is everybody? Why can't we remember anything? - I still don't trust her. Or you. - I wouldn't worry 'bout it. You're not my type either, babe. - We can't turn on each other. Not now. Not with that thing out there. - What happened to the girl in the straight jacket? - She didn't make it. - I guess she wasn't as dangerous as we all thought. - What do you think is in there? - It's probably just a supply closet. We should keep moving. - I don't think it is. (suspenseful music) You guys might wanna see this. I think I found out who we are. - Who? - You're a computer programmer named Charlie. - My name is Stacy. I'm a finance executive for a venture capital firm and this place was one of my clients. - Well Stacy, you and I should get along. I'm a lawyer named Jack. - I don't think we're gonna be getting along, Jack. - Why's that? - Because according to this, my name is Steve. I'm a prisoner here. - What do you mean prisoner? - Prisoner. As in bad guy, criminal. They even included my rap sheet. I don't remember doing any of this stuff. - There are no bad people here today. Just scared ones. - What about you, doc? Who are you? - My name is Kate. Doctor Kate Adams. - (laughs) So the doc really is a doc. - It seems so. - Does any of this ring a bell with anyone? - Look at this. - It's about time. - I have you all beat. I really am a mental patient. According to this, I'm a fashion model named Amber, but then I had a nervous breakdown and I was sent here for treatment because there's nowhere better to cure your insanity than this place. - It's okay. You're no worse off than the rest of us now. - I know. - The girl in the straight jacket. Her name was Melissa. She worked as a nurse here. And the man we saw killed upstairs. He was a security chief. - What the nurse, a security chief? I guess that rules out the people in charge did this to us. - I don't get it. So, are we in a prison or a mental hospital? - I'm guessing neither or both. Eight lockers and there were eight of us. Eight people who can't remember who they are or how they got here. - Give me that, kid. The one with the experience should handle it. - And what experience is that? - Armed robbery, attempted murder, and a tendency towards violence. - Great idea. Give the felon a gun. Are you gonna let the next serial killer we find out of his cell, too? - Don't worry. If she does, I'll protect you. - I don't think bullets can hurt it any more than a scalpel can, but it seemed to be scared of light. - Either way if I were you, I'd watch my back, Jack. (monster growling) What we waiting for? Let's go. - What do we do? - We follow him. (soft music) - Amber. - Huh? - You said you woke up down here? - Yup. - What are you thinking? - Well, if we are the only people still alive, I wanna see where crazy girl came from. - Are we just gonna follow this lunatic? - For now. - Wait. (phone ringing) - It's a phone. - [Kate] I think it's coming from behind these doors. (dramatic music) (phone ringing) Come on. - We have to get to that phone. - Let me try one more. Open up. - Stopped ringing. - We're not getting in this way. - [Kate] Come on. - [Steve] So the big man has no plan. - [Charlie] Maybe someone knows we're here. - This was the room I woke up in. - It's nicer than mine. - It's nicer than all of ours. - Being crazy has its advantages. - This is a two way mirror. - So they're observing her. - Like a lab animal. - Can you break the glass? - It's pretty thick. (phone ringing) We have to get to that phone. - How are we gonna do that? - Like this. - Whoa. (phone ringing) Somebody answer that phone. (phone ringing) - Hello. Hello. Hello. The line went dead as soon as I picked it up. - Give me that. Hello. Hello. Damn. - Let's hope it wasn't only a loose wire. - Don't even start with me, big man. (dramatic music) - We're definitely through the looking glass now. - How can there be blood and no bodies? - A lot of them were killed in here. - A lot of who? People who did this to us or more people like us? - What are you doing? - What? - We shouldn't be touching any of this stuff. - Aye. Leave the kid alone, big man. Computer's not gonna hurt us. - Computers are friends. - She's really starting to creep me out. - We can't get out this way. - So we're gonna die in this room like they did or we're gonna pick one of the other rooms? - No one's gonna die in any room. Charlie, you're a programmer. See what you can find out. - Already working on it. As far as I can tell we're in a psychiatric research facility run by a Doctor Fredrick Manger. It seems Doctor Manger developed a machine that could completely wipe clean all a person's memories. - For what purpose? - I think it was originally intended for the treatment of mentally traumatized patients, but it seems Doctor Manger was exploring other uses. - Like what? - Well. Amber was the first person it was tested on. - Little extreme for a nervous breakdown, don't you think? - According to this, you were also a nymphomaniac. - So let me guess. The criminal came next, right? - Yes. In an attempt to cure your violent tendencies. - Guess it didn't work. - [Charlie] You were third, Jack. - Me? - Apparently you were catatonic and Doctor Manger thought the memory wipe would wake you up, but something went wrong. - What? I'm awake, aren't I? - I don't know. Something about the body leading to the mind which leads to the spirit. - What does that mean? - I have no idea. The log says the machine was used eight times, but Jack's is the last entry. - Was there anything at all about the rest of us? - Not about you, Kate, but Stacy's name is on the visitor's list. - Amber and I were patients. Steve was a prisoner. Stacy was a visitor. What about you, Charlie? - Along with Dave the security chief and Melissa the nurse, I am. I worked here. - Still doesn't explain where the shadow creature came from or how the hell we all got here. - It explains enough. - Steve. - Everybody else in this place is dead except for you. Interesting how that is, isn't it? - I don't remember anything. Even if I did, I was only a computer tech. - Let him go. - I would sure like to kill that Doctor Manger, but he's probably already dead. So that means I'm gonna have to just settle for you. - He was memory swiped. He was locked in his cell just like the rest of us. That puts him on our team not theirs. - Yeah? Well you worked here, too, doc. So what side of the fence does that put you on? - The one that gets us all the hell out of here alive. - Whatever you say, doc. - [Jack] Anything? - These cables lead to the main generator, which must be above ground somewhere. They're old to begin with but that thing must've damaged them even further and so the flickering lights. - What about the phone lines? - Same deal except they're completely gone. Even if we had answered the phone sooner, chances are wouldn't have been able to hear anything. - We found two more flashlights but that's about it. - What are we going to do, Kate? - Yeah, doc. What are we gonna do now? - According to that map there's only one way in and out of this place and that's back upstairs where the security chief said it was. - He also said it was electronically locked. Even if we can get to it, we can't open it. - An electronic lock has to have power. Turn it off, the lights go out. The lock opens. - Can you do that? - The computer can. But in order to do it, the network has to be up and running and the network requires at least two computers. - [Jack] Where are we gonna find another computer? - The computer in the hospital room. - Where the coma guy was? That place was completely trashed. Everything was destroyed. - You don't need a monitor or a keyboard. You just need the computer itself to turn on. I can do the rest from here. - So you said the shadow creature's afraid of the lights. Right? So your bright idea's to turn off all the freaking lights? - Unless you got a better idea. - You know what crazy girl? You might be the sanest one here after all. - Once the main generator is turned off, only the pool and deprivation room will still have power. They run off a different source. - Let's do it. - There's just one problem. I can't turn off the power until the network connection's made. - What do you mean? You have to stay here? No. You'll be left here completely in the dark. How will you get back to us? - Hopefully with this. - He'll never make it. - We might not even make it. - Just make sure you get that second computer working. - I'm staying with you. - The moment the power goes off, the two of you move it. - We will. Just don't leave without us. - Never. (suspenseful music) Brave kids back there. - You know I don't trust either one of 'em. - Just keep an eye out. (suspenseful music) - You think it's still down there? - Could be anywhere by now. Hiding. Waiting. Planning. - Let's hope it doesn't do any of those things. (soft music) - This is where we found the crazy girl swimming naked. - Naked? - I wish I had known. Maybe I would've been nicer to her. (soft music) - Shh, shh, shh. You guys came through this? You're braver than I thought. - All right. All we can do now is wait. - Do you think we'll make it? - If they get that other computer working, we might actually have a chance. - What if they don't? - Then. I get to die next to a half naked nymphomaniac supermodel. (suspenseful music) (monitor beeping) - Where's his body? - What? - The man we met. The security chief. He was killed here. Where's his body? - Let's just get that computer working. Kid said we didn't need the monitor or the keyboard right? - Why didn't the shadow creature kill him? - Maybe it thought he was already dead. - You mean brain dead. His body's still alive. - Yeah. - This is the mind wipe machine, or at least what's left of it, and like us this man was a victim of it. - Bummer for him. So big man, can you get that computer running or not? - No, you don't understand. The machine was used eight times. There are eight of us, but if you include him, that makes nine. - What are you saying, Kate? - She's saying that one of us has been lying the whole time. One of us is one of them. - So the kid really could be a spy? Is that what you're saying, huh doc? That the kid set us all up to die? - Where are you going? - Before we turn off the lights, we better make sure that there really is an exit. - [Stacy] How do we know you're not the spy? - 'Cause when you found me I was chained to the wall. Wasn't for the doc, I'd probably still be there. Make sure you don't turn on that computer 'til after we get back. Come on. - What if it's Amber not Charlie and the whole crazy girl thing is just an act? - Well either way, if I die, I'm taking somebody with me. - Jack. What was your last name? - Why do you ask? - Was it Roberts? - Could be. - Because this man's name is Jack Roberts. - Then I guess I couldn't be him. - No. You couldn't. - I know when the lights go out, the shadow creature is going to attack with a vengeance. - Who are you? - We were trying to help people. Give them a new life without having them imprisoned by their old one. Without the memories of who you were, you could truly become what you wanted to be, but something went wrong. - You mind wiped someone without a mind. - The relationship between mind, body, and spirit is a complicated one. Far more interconnected than we ever thought. Jack's body was intact but when my machine didn't find his mind, it went after his, I think his soul. And this monstrosity was somehow released. - What is it? - Pure life essence. But now it hungers for more than just mind and body. It desires to consume all life. - So it killed everyone. - Almost everyone. Direct light hurts it. That you know. So those in bright cells were temporarily safe. - You knew all along what happened to us. - Yeah. You happened to us? - What? - When the shadow creature was released, you locked the facility so it wouldn't escape. So I wouldn't escape. - You're Doctor Manger. - Yes. - And who am I? - You're my wife. - The network's on. Get that flashlight ready. - We were betrayed by our nurse, Melissa. Like you, she thought I was going too far with my experiments. Unlike you she told Stacy about it at our annual audit. Our funding was at stake so I was forced to mind wipe the both of them. Charlie and the security guard didn't like that, so I had to do them as well. - Why did you mind wipe me if I was your wife? - 'Cause you turned against me, Kate. You sided with my enemies. I love you more than anything, and so to preserve that love I wiped your mind clean of all of those bad thoughts. - You're a sick bastard. - Perhaps but ironically those without memories or clothes fare the best. The shadow creature is going to kill everyone just the same, but it seems to prefer those with their identities intact. So, take off your clothes, doctor. You wouldn't want to be his first target. - [Steve] Kid might be right. This could work. - [Stacy] You think so? - It's gonna be a long way in the dark, but we found an exit. - Look out. (dramatic music) No. Run Stacy. Run. - I've been waiting to do that for a long time. (dramatic music) - Let's go. - Stacy. Stacy. (monster growling) (suspenseful music) Stacy. Come on, we have to get out of here. The shadow creature could be anywhere. Come on. - Jack. Why did he do it? - Because he's not Jack. He's Doctor Manger. Come on. - [Stacy] What are we gonna do? - Charlie and Amber are gonna be here any minute and then we're gonna get the hell out of here. - That's very optimistic of you. You always were an optimist, Kate. - The only good thing about being memory swiped is I don't have to remember being married to you. - I was originally hoping you and I would make it out of this together. - Now who's the optimist? You better hope none of us escape and tell the world what you did here. - I plan to. - No. No. Open the door. No. Open the door. Open it. Open the door, no. - The pool's just up ahead. (soft dramatic music) - Amber, run. (monster screeching) (screaming) Where'd it go? - I think it's gone. Maybe it's scared of the water. - Come on, let's get out of here. (dramatic music) Amber, get out of the water. Amber. (monster screeching) (monster growling) - Take off your clothes. - What? - Do it fast. Take 'em off. (screaming) (monster growling) (screaming) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - [Jack] Whoa. - Remember me? - No. (suspenseful music) (monster growling) - Ah. (door squealing) - I thought you might be hiding in here. Nobody gets left behind. Remember? - Charlie. - Where's Stacy? - She didn't make it. - It got Amber, too. What about Jack? - He's not Jack. He's Doctor Manger and he killed Steve before locking us in here to die. - Well we're not dead yet. - No, we're not. (suspenseful music) (monster growling) - How are we gonna get past it? - Take your clothes off. It makes you less of a target. (monster growling) - Now what? - Get your flashlight ready. On the count of three we're going to charge. - What? - This is our only chance. Just don't point until I give the word, okay? One. Two. Three. Ah. Now. (suspenseful music) (monster growling) Climb, Charlie. Don't stop. (dramatic music) Go. Go. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. (soft music) Go. (suspenseful music) (monster growling) Run. (monster growling) (suspenseful music) (monster screeching) (screaming) - [Charlie] Good morning. - What happened? Where are we? - You don't remember? - No, I do. - Thank God. It's bad enough remembering only one day of my life.
