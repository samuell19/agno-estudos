IT'S YOUR GODDAMN JOB! WE'RE ON A CLOCK, FRANK. BRING HIM UP TO SPEED. GARY WAS FOUND LAST NIGHT IN AN ALLEY OFF OF ABBOT KINNEY AND ELECTRIC. HE WAS WITH A BLONDE GAL. THEY WERE BOTH SHOT IN THE HEAD. ANY OF YOU RECOGNIZE HER? Samantha: SHE WAS AT THE PARTY YESTERDAY. SHE INTRODUCED GARY TO A RECORD PROMOTER. Frank: WHO'S THE RECORD PROMOTER? GUY BY THE NAME OF WEXLER REED. RUMOR HAS IT THAT HE LAUNDERS DRUG MONEY THROUGH HIS COMPANY. OK, NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR RUMORS. WE NEED FACTS. SO WHAT HAPPENED NEXT? I WENT TO TALK TO JOBEY. THE RING MEANS THAT GARY, HE'D BE KNOCKING DOWN DOORS TO FIND MY KILLER. WHO'S THIS JOBEY? HE'S A SCUMBAG SURFER. LEADS THE NORTHSIDE CREW. WE'RE CLOSE TO SIGNING HIM A DEAL. JOBEY THREATENED GARY. THREATENED HOW? WHY? BECAUSE OF THAT PICTURE. YOU THINK JOBEY MADE GARY? WELL, I DIDN'T AT THE TIME, BUT NOW, I MEAN, NOW-- WHAT HAPPENED NEXT? I FOUND TYLER. AND THEN WE WENT TO LOOK FOR GARY AND HIS CAR WAS GONE. THAT'S THE LAST TIME THAT I... YOU TWO HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD? WE WERE WORKING SOUTHSIDE CREW ALL DAY. WHAT? LAST NIGHT AROUND 10:00, UM, GARY BEEPED ME... ON THE 2-WAY. AND I TRIED TO CALL HIM BACK, BUT I COULDN'T GET HIM. WHAT'D HE SAY? IT'S... COME ON, SPIT IT OUT, DANNY! IT SOUNDED LIKE HE SAID, "GOLD PLATED GUN." JESUS, DANNY... I-I THOUGHT GARY-- IT WAS JUST PLAYING AROUND. I'M SORRY. OK, OK. LET'S... BE SORRY LATER. LET'S KEEP THIS SIMPLE, OK? THE BLONDE WAS LINKED TO THE RECORD PROMOTER. LET'S START WITH HIM. YEAH, MAYBE HE CAN TELL US WHY GARY HAD 3 KILOS OF COCAINE IN THE BACK OF HIS CAR. WHAT? OH, HE FORGOT TO MENTION THAT PART? YOU WERE ALL HAND-PICKED TO BE PART OF THIS TASK FORCE. AND NOW IT SEEMS SOMEBODY COULDN'T KEEP HIS HAND OUT OF THE COOKIE JAR. GARY WASN'T DIRTY. ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT 48 HOURS TO PROVE IT, OR YOU'RE ALL SUSPENDED. OH, THIS IS BULLSHIT. UH, LIFE'S A BITCH. RIGHT, DANNY? LET'S GO, SERGEANT. LET'S MAKE THIS CASE. ALL RIGHT. WE DOING 2 CARS OR ONE? LISTEN, I'D LOVE TO HELP, BUT I'VE GOT HOOK-UP WITH POPTOP. JESUS, JACK, GARY'S DEAD. I KNOW THAT, SAM. AND I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE RIPPED MY HEART OUT OF MY FUCKING CHEST. BUT IF GARY WERE HERE, HE'D BE THE FIRST ONE TO SAY THAT SOUTHSIDE'S JUST WAY TOO BIG TO JUST WALK AWAY. JACK'S RIGHT. YEAH. LOOK, GO MEET POPTOP. WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED. ALL RIGHT. I'LL TAKE THE FRONT, YOU GUYS TAKE THE BACK. THINK TYLER'S GONNA BE OK? GONNA HURT LIKE HELL FOR A WHILE, BUT SHE'S TOUGH. SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT. WE ALL WILL. OH, SHIT. I GOT IT. THANKS. STOP. WHAT? WELL... MAYBE YOU CAN DO NO STRINGS, DANNY, BUT...I DON'T THINK I CAN. AHEM. YEAH, MAYBE IN A DIFFERENT WORLD, SAM, BUT WE'RE UNDERCOVER. I MEAN, COME ON. [SCOFFS] YOU CAN'T JUST DECIDE HOW YOU'RE GONNA FEEL. OR AT LEAST I CAN'T. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO GARY AND TYLER. ARE YOU WANTING ME TO OPEN MYSELF ALL THE UP TO YOU, THEN, GOD FORBID, SOMETHING HAPPENS, AND... WHAT IF, THEN? WHAT IF WHAT? WHAT IF I WAS PREGNANT? [SIGHS] WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?

THIS GUY'S A NEW SUPPLIER FOR JOBEY. WHAT'S HE DOING WITH WEXLER? MAYBE HE'S TRYING TO CUT JOBEY OUT. WELL, IF JOBEY FINDS OUT, WEXLER'S A DEAD MAN. SAM, STAY ON WEXLER, ALL RIGHT? I'M ON IT. HE DOESN'T LOOK HAPPY ABOUT SOMETHING. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? SHUT THE MEET DOWN. LET'S COVER THE BACK, ALL RIGHT? WHERE IS HE? WE LOST HIM. I DON'T GET IT. ARE WE BEING TAILED? GOD DAMN IT!

HOLD UP, OK? I GOT ONE PERSON DEAD. I GOT ANOTHER ONE FIGHTING FOR HER LIFE. I'M NOT RISKING ANY MORE LIVES HERE. I KNOW, BUT, FRANK, WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. IF LUCIOUS ISN'T DEAD ALREADY, HE WILL BE THE SECOND POPTOP FINDS OUT WHAT HE WANTS TO KNOW. FINE. JACK AND DANNY ARE PRIMARY. NO. POPTOP KNOWS ME. HE'LL BLOW MY COVER.
