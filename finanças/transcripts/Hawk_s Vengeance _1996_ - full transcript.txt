MOSTLY THEY PROTECT THEIR OWN FROM ALL THE OTHER GANGS BREATHING DOWN THEIR NECKS, IN PARTICULAR, THE DEATH SKULLS. DEATH SKULLS? WOLF PACK. SKINHEADS. FASCIST WHITE-SUPREMACIST BASTARDS. [ SIGHS ] SOME OF THE BA WONG HAVE GONE MISSING OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. WE THINK THE SKINHEADS ARE INVOLVED, BUT... [ MAN WOLF-WHISTLES ] OF COURSE, NO ONE'S TALKING. AND, UH, WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE SUSPENSION? SOLDIER HUNG ONE OF THE SKINHEADS OUT OF A FIVE-STORY WINDOW, TRYING TO GET HIM TO TALK. SHOULD'VE FUCKING DROPPED HIM. [ PITCHER CLATTERS ] WILL YOU EXCUSE ME A MINUTE, DETECTIVE? LIZZIE. EVERYONE CALLS ME LIZZIE. LIZZIE, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. GENTLEMEN, I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE YOU WERE SALUTING ME...

THIS MUST BE PAYBACK FOR DUSTING THEIR MAN. [ GRUNTS ] [ GRUNTS ] DON'T YOU WORRY, MR. GARR. I'M GONNA FIND THIS CLAY, AND I'M GONNA TURN HIS SKULL INTO AN ASHTRAY. JUST LIKE YOU DID WITH KELLY. [ GRUNTS ] [ GRUNTS ] [ GRUNTS ] AAH! HE'S NOT GONNA GET AWAY AGAIN. HE BETTER NOT. I DON'T CARE IF IT TAKES YOU 20 MORE TRIES OR 20 MORE FINGERS. I WANT HIM DEAD. YOU GOT IT? [ GRUNTS, GROANS ] DO YOU AND THAT CRANIUM-IMPAIRED IDIOT CATCH MY DRIFT? ON SECOND THOUGHT, WE NEED THE BODIES. WE DON'T HAVE THE SKINHEADS TO DO THE ROUNDUPS ANYMORE. EXTRA CREDIT IF YOU YO-YOS BAG HIM ALIVE. BRING HIM BACK HERE. SO, WHAT'S WITH THE NICKNAME -- HAWK? JUST A SWIFT-SWOOPING, KILLER TYPE OF GUY? WHAT? [ CHUCKLES ] IN A DEFENSIVE SENSE, PERHAPS. AND HOW ABOUT YOU AND JACK? HE WAS AS AMERICAN AS APPLE PIE, AND YOU'RE... A LOYAL SUBJECT OF THE QUEEN. YEAH. SO HOW'D THAT HAPPEN? [ SIGHS ] MY DAD WAS IN THE MARINES -- U.S. MARINES. HE'D MOVE FROM STATION TO STATION. JACK'S MOTHER DIED WHEN HE WAS FOUR YEARS OLD IN AFRICA. DAD REMARRIED IN ENGLAND WHEN HE WAS STATIONED AT THE U.S. EMBASSY IN LONDON. AND THAT WAS YOUR MOM? YEAH. WE KNOCKED AROUND THE WORLD FOR A WHILE UNTIL DAD WAS SENT TO VIETNAM. HE WAS KILLED PROTECTING THE U.S. EMBASSY IN THE FINAL DAYS OF THE EVACUATION. OH. TALK ABOUT YOUR BAD BREAKS. WE LIVED IN AMERICA FOR A WHILE UNTIL MUM DECIDED TO RETURN TO ENGLAND. JACK DIDN'T WANT TO GO. HE WAS 17 AND DECIDED TO JOIN THE MARINES. AND WHEN YOU FINISHED SCHOOL, YOU JOINED THE BRITISH MARINES, JUST LIKE YOUR BROTHER. [ CHUCKLES SOFTLY ] JACK WAS MY HERO. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] SO, UH, HOW ABOUT COMING BACK TO MY PLACE? HOW ABOUT MY PLACE? OH, SHIT. I LIVE IN CAMDEN PARK. IT'S A HALF-AN-HOUR DRIVE. SO IT'S MY PLACE. DAMN! IT'S STILL A MESS. MMM. MY PLACE IT IS. MY PLACE. HMM. Both: HOW ABOUT RIGHT HERE? WE'RE HERE FOR THE NEW ARRIVAL. YOU WANT HIM, YOU GO THROUGH ME. [ GUN COCKS ] WHATEVER. NO. LIPING, IT'S ALL RIGHT. MOVE IT. [ LATCH CLICKS ] [ MACHINERY BEEPING ] SAW. MORELLI, YOU'RE REPLACING JOHNNY. I WANT YOU ON STANDBY. YOU'VE GOT AN 8:00 A.M. FLIGHT TO LIBYA. H-HEY, WAIT. I-I'M NO DELIVERYMAN. UH, C-CAN'T YOU GET SOMEBODY ELSE? THERE IS NO ONE ELSE. [ SAW GRINDING ] PINKUS, I WANT YOU STICKING AROUND TILL AFTER CLEANUP. YOU'RE ON PACKAGE-DISPOSAL DUTY. BENIGNI IS WAITING TO TAKE YOU OUT TO PIER 91. YOU GOT IT, BLADE. WHOA. LOOKY HERE. CONGRATULATIONS. IT'S A HEART. [ HISSES ] [ COOLER LID CLOSES ] YOU GUYS EVER WATCH THE DOC MAKE ONE OF HER PACKAGES? [ SAW BUZZING ] AND POLICE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE VICTIM OF THAT FIRE AS GERALD CLAY, SUSPECTED LEADER OF THE NOTORIOUS SKINHEAD GANG KNOWN AS THE DEATH SKULLS. CLAY'S CHARRED REMAINS WERE FIRST DISCOVERED BY FIRE FIGHTERS RESPONDING TO A 911 CALL IN THE GREENPOINT SECTION. WAIT. GO BACK. WHAT WAS THAT? WHO THE HELL ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT? NOTHING. COULD YOU JUST GO BACK? I WANT TO SEE THAT. LIZ, IT'S JUST AN OLD BLACK-AND-WHITE MOVIE. IT'S NOTHING. HAWK... WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? WHAT? COME ON! GIVE IT TO ME. LIZZIE. NOW... WHAT CHANNEL WAS IT? IT WAS NOTHING! IT... [ SIGHS ] SEE? FIRE INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE THAT CLAY WAS BURNED TO DEATH HERE. IN A HOMEMADE NAPALM BLAST. EARLIER TODAY, WE SPOKE WITH CHIEF INVESTIGATOR MORRIS SHERWIN. MY GUESS IS THAT THIS IS THE WORK OF A SPECIALIST, SOMEONE WITH HEAVY-DUTY GUERRILLA TRAINING OR MAYBE SPECIAL FORCES. WE'LL KNOW MORE IN A FEW DAYS AFTER WE'VE HAD OCCASION -- YOU LYING PIECE OF SHIT! HOW COULD YOU DO THIS? LIZZIE, I'M SORRY. I CAN EXPLAIN. YEAH? YEAH? WELL, GO AHEAD. EXPLAIN. I WANT TO HEAR THIS. [ SIGHS ] OKAY, MAYBE I CAN'T EXPLAIN. OH, JESUS, HAWK. DON'T YOU REALIZE I HAVE TO ARREST YOU? [ CLICKS TONGUE ] HOW COULD YOU DO THIS? I TRUSTED YOU. LOOK, LIZZIE, I'M REALLY SORRY. OH, SHIT. ALL RIGHT. LET'S HAVE IT. EVERYTHING. [ SIGHS DEEPLY ] MY BROTHER WAS SET UP BY A MAN NAMED GARR. GARR? YEAH. THE SKINHEADS WERE JUST BAIT. APPARENTLY GARR'S BEHIND ALL THE DISAPPEARANCES OF THE BA WONG. SOLDIER WAS ONTO THEM. CLAY AND HIS BOYS WOULD TAKE THE BA WONG TO GARR, AND THEY'D JUST DISAPPEAR FOR GOOD. NOT FOR GOOD. ONE OF THEM WASHED ASHORE THE OTHER DAY. I KNOW ALL ABOUT GARR, THOUGH. YOU DO? HE'S AN EX-MARINE. HE'S WHAT? DID A TOUR OF MANILA, WHERE HE HONED HIS MARTIAL-ARTS SKILLS. HE STUDIED WITH THE BEST. THEN, IN '91, CHARGED WITH RUNNING A BLACK-MARKET ARMS RING. NOW, THE MARINES COULDN'T PROVE IT. BUT THEY REQUESTED HE RESIGN HIS COMMISSION. SO HE CAME BACK HERE, ESTABLISHED HIMSELF IN THE RACKETS, AND TODAY HE'S ONE OF THE LEADING CRIME BOSSES IN THE AREA. I THINK IT'S TIME I HAD A LITTLE CHAT WITH OUR MR. GARR, MARINE TO MARINE. DAMN IT, HAWK. YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS TO ME. YOU SIT ON YOUR GODDAMN HANDS, TAKE A VALIUM, AND LET THE POLICE HANDLE THIS. I WILL ARREST YOU. IS THAT CLEAR...CAPTAIN? LIZZIE, LISTEN TO ME. LISTEN FOR JUST A MOMENT. RIGHT NOW YOU'RE BOUND BY A CODE OF CONDUCT, AND I'M NOT, WHICH MEANS IN SOME WAYS I CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE. IF YOU WANT TO ARREST ME, THEN GO AHEAD. BUT WAIT TILL AFTER WE NAIL THIS BASTARD. I'M LATE FOR WORK. [ SIREN WAILING ] [ WAILING STOPS ] UH, GOOD DAY, OFFICER. UH, CAN I HELP YOU? IS SOMETHING WRONG? THAT'S JUST WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO ASK YOU. YOU WERE DOING 25 IN A 60-MILE-PER-HOUR ZONE. UH... UH, JUST BEING CAREFUL. CAN I SEE YOUR LICENSE AND REGISTRATION? SURE. SO, WHAT'S THAT? OH, THE COOLER? UH, UH, IT'S -- IT'S A COOLER. WHAT DO YOU GOT IN THERE? NOTHING. NOTHING. NOTHING. UH, WAIT. THERE -- THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE. REALLY? TAKE A LOOK-SEE. STEP OUT OF THE CAR. RIGHT. STEP OUT OF THE CAR SLOWLY. YEAH. DON'T SHOOT. STEP OUT OF THE CAR. I'M... STEP OUT. YEAH. JUST DON'T -- DON'T SHOOT. TURN AROUND RIGHT HERE. UP AGAINST THE CAR. UP AGAINST THE CAR. TURN AROUND. OKAY, REMEMBER, WHEN YOU USE YOUR FLASH-BANG, CLOSE YOUR EYES, OR YOU'LL BE JUST AS BAD OFF AS YOUR ENEMIES. DON'T KILL ANYBODY. YOU READ ME? NOW, WHAT'S THE PLAN? QUICK AND CLEAN, IN AND OUT. IF MY BOYS ARE INSIDE, SPLIT UP, CALL THE COPS. IF NOT, TOSS A COUPLE FLASH-BANGS, GRAB A HOSTAGE, TRY TO GET HIM TO BLAB. HEY, PRETTY GOOD. DID YOU EVER THINK OF JOINING YOUR MARINES? FUCK, NO, SIR.
