This is stupid. No it's not, this is awesome. No, it's stupid. How is this scary? Not bad. Well that's cute, they didn't even make it down to me. But did you see them run? I told you this thing would work. At least it squirts. God, I need a cigarette. Please keep your hands inside the car at all times. Don't stand up during the ride. Wait for the ride to come to a complete stop before getting out. What did I say about smoking? It causes cancer? That is not what I said. I said no smoking when you're on the clock, especially in front of the kids. Or in the park. And what are you doing? Smoking. No, I'm dying slowly. Mostly from this job, but not entirely. I'm not gonna warn you again. Put it out. We'll talk about this at the end of your shift. Close up's in about a half an hour. Once these folks are done, close the ride down and then come to the meeting in the lounge. Shit. Oh, so close. Hey, nice throw. Hey, you won a prize. The dog. There ya go. Hi, Jennifer. Hi, Mr. Grazier. Looks like it's been a winner's night. Looks that way. Look, I know that the park's closing soon but let's not be too generous. I just wanna see a few extra smiles, that's all. You know, before it all goes away? Yeah, yeah, I guess you're right. A little generosity never hurt anyone. Hey, are you gonna come to the meeting later? It'll be quick. Yeah, sure thing. I hear this game's fixed. - Boo. - Hello. So, are you coming out with us tonight? Oh, I don't know. I haven't talked to Blake. Have you seen him? Seen him? He's your boyfriend. He's not my boyfriend. Well, I don't, why did he say something? Haven't you guys been on, like, three dates already? No, I haven't seen him. Tony, have you seen him? You know, I think he was working the haunted house tonight but we were over there earlier and didn't see him, so maybe he was up front taking tickets? I don't know. What happened to your hand? This guy? It's an occupational hazard. Mm-hm. - Do you like it? - Eww, it's so gross. Stop. Workers comp here I come. Tony just loves showing off his little stump, don't you? Just for you, babe. 'Cause I'm the only one that doesn't laugh at it. I'm gonna sneak out for a smoke before our closing meeting. Cover for me, okay? - Okay. Do you need a hand with that? You want a hand? Oh, and hey, if you see Blake can you tell him I'm looking for him? Okay. Blake? Hello? Nice try, Rhodie, nice try. What, not scary enough? I think I've seen that one a few times before. Oh admit it, you were a little scared. No, not really. It's the mask isn't it? I need something better than this. Keep on it. Maybe somethin' with more. Are you going to the party tonight after work? I actually haven't been invited yet. Have you seen Blake? - Blake? Um, no. - Yeah. Wasn't he working the Blue Streak tonight? I was wondering, um-- Do you think you can go find him for me? I need to go change. I'm sure he'll turn up for the meeting. Hey, and maybe you can scare him with your mask before then. I guess. And I'll see if I can get you into the party. Okay, sure. Occupado. Oh! Oh, sorry. Thank God this is my last night in this dump. I'd seriously quit if it weren't. So, are we partying tonight? Is our manager a creepy pervert? Where's your lover boy, Tony? Taking a leak in the little boys room. Roy's picking me up at 11:30. Seriously, what is this shit made of? Oh, and good news. My parents left the keys to the liquor cabinet out. There's the life of the party. How about you, Jenny girl, you comin'? - Oh, no, I don't know. It's not really my thing. Jen, Jen, Jen, don't be so frigid. You'll never get lucky with that attitude. So, how far have you and Blake got? Far enough. Really? Sounds like Blake's still waiting in the batter's circle. At least let the poor guy get to second base. You like him, right? Well, yeah, I mean, he's cute but I don't even know if he likes me, so... Tell you what, bring him to the party. Have a few drinks. You'll have to pick up that habit, too. Then we'll just see what happens, 'kay? I don't know, it's just-- I mean, it's just sex. Gotta do it sometime. You really don't wanna miss out. Speaking of missing out. Har, har. One time. More like five. Tony's got a few problems. Come on, girl, let's get this over with. Got a little somethin' there. Nothin' like a little peer pressure, especially from a cum dumb strain of future homemaker. Smoke? All right, let's get this started. Where's Blake? I don't know. Maybe he left early. And where's Rhodie? Rhodie's looking for Blake. Look, I don't call these meetings to listen to myself talk. When I call a meeting I expect everyone to be here. Let's get this show on the road. As you all know, Fright Land's closing down. How could this happen? I'm sure you've all noticed that the attendance has just dropped off. There's enough funds coming in to keep the park open. And speaking of funds, it's gonna take weeks to process your final paychecks. What? Are you kidding me? Hold on, hold on. It's part of the bankruptcy filing. All of Mr. Hyde's accounts are frozen by the bank until all the paperwork has been processed. Sorry guys, it's not my fault. I've tried everything I can to keep this park open by any and all means. I'm as saddened by it closing as anyone here. Hi, Henry. I'm gonna make my rounds and make sure no dumb ass kid is stuck in a ride somewhere. Let's try to get outta here sometime tonight, huh? No problem, Henry. We're almost done here. Be just a few more minutes. I'll be back in 20 minutes to let you out the gate. Blake? Oh God. Bit lat for games, isn't it? I was just hoping to scare somebody. Well, it looks like I beat you to it. I catch you dickin' around out here again, next time I'll just shoot and not ask any questions. Got it? Fuckin' kids. Hey, have you seen Blake? All right, now you're each gonna have to fill one of these out. Well now, which one is it? Okay. All right, this is so we can guarantee that you're gonna get your W-2 forms next year. You're just gonna have to fill all this out. If you are a dependent you're gonna have to mark that. If no one can claim you as a dependent put a zero there. Hey, so are we still getting booze for tonight? I think so. But who's gonna get it? Hey, Allison, doesn't Roy have a fake ID? Yup, he looks like a mental patient in the photo. Good, so call him up and let's get some beer here. Are you serious? Drink in the park? What do you think, Jen? Oh, sure, sounds good. But what about Marty? Don't worry about Marty. He'll play along. The accidental death form. Be sure that you filled that out. That's for insurance purposes for the park. Hm, yeah, first name, last name, home address. That's your home address, not your mailing address. Don't mix that up because then you might not get your W-2 legally. If you don't have that then the IRS comes to visit. I know what that's like. Evening. A pack of smokes, too. Can I see some ID? Sure. Who is this, your dad? Puberty's a bitch. $44.50. No, no way. The boss would have my butt. Come on, Marty. You're the boss, right? I mean, just a little party, just us. We'll all be right here and you can watch us. No! I can't have you drinking. I know we're closing, but-- Well, we should celebrate. Just a few drinks among coworkers. I mean, it's just going to be us. Who knows what might happen? That's just the thing, isn't it? That's my concern. I can't have one of you idiots getting sloshed and falling into a ride. Much better. I guess it couldn't hurt. Wait, wait, wait, wait, ground rules. We keep it inside the park. We're gonna keep the gate closed and I'm gonna go around and collect everyone's keys. Is Ray able to bring alcohol? On its way. I'm gonna go get done up. I'll come with. Easy cowboy. I'll just only be a few minutes. Wait here. Oh, now I'm definitely coming. Here, Rhode. Thanks for the hand. Okay, the joke was old the first time you told it. Now, come on. Hey, Rhodie, any luck? None. What's Carlee see in that guy anyways? Probably captain of the football team. Then college star, NFL quarterback, then payday. And I'm just another geek. Don't be so hard on yourself, okay. He can barely read. Hey, actually, we're gonna all have drinks after this. Maybe you can have a drink and talk to her. Since when do you drink? Since tonight? I don't know. It seemed like as a good a night as any to start. You mean since you and Blake finally close the night together. I actually haven't got to see him at all. I wonder what's taking him so long. I couldn't find him and Henry didn't know where he was either. He shouldn't be gone this long. Hey, I didn't get to go through all the rides. I mean, somethin' probably broke. This place is fallin' apart. Maybe it's a good thing they're closing it. I mean, you don't want anybody to get hurt. Hello? Bunch of ungrateful... Hello? Quit screwin' around. You're jumpy. Little scared of the dark? I ain't scared. Coulda been a psycho for all I know. Some creep hangin' out in the bushes. A werewolf in the bushes. How am I supposed to get in? Security guard has the keys. Climb over. You kidding? Go get the keys. Henry's making his rounds. Besides, we're not supposed to be doing this. Just climb over. Yeah, and pass the booze through the fence. And now you. Just like gym class. Shut up, geek. I failed gym class. Hey, what's up? Blake's car is still in the parking lot. He must still be in the park. We partyin' or what? Definitely. Hey, whose van is that? I still don't get what the big deal is or are you just that anxious to get him alone? I don't know, it's just weird. I haven't seen him in a few hours and he wasn't even at the meeting. Okay, stop. Here. What? It's not much of a party if we're all freaked, is it? Well? Oh my... Let's party! Feel better? Yes! Mmm. Hey babe, wanna throw me my clothes? That's funny. Someone here? Hey! Who's down there? No kiddin' around, kid. No foolin' around. I really will shoot your ass. You know what? I feel like french fries. Really? The booze is definitely here by now. Let's just go back. Marty showed me how to use the deep fryer once. I'm pretty sure he just wanted to see me bend over and pick up potatoes. Yeah, probably. Hello? The park is closed. The hours of operation are four p.m. until 10 p.m. I'm sick of this. This is going to be great. Better than any party at Carlee's house. Maybe we could try out a ride or two. Pervert. Who's got a light? Where are you going? Gonna go check the security office and see if Henry saw Blake. His car's still in the parking lot. I'll come with you. Buddy, try not to drink it all at once, okay? Do I know you? No, but I'm the boss and I say take it easy. Sure thing, boss. Take it easy. Dick. What's his deal? - Creepy, right? - Yeah. I heard he put a peep hole in the girls bathroom. - What? - Yeah. Disgusting. - All right, car keys. Hand 'em over. You, too, Rhodie. Get over here, no arguing. Dude, that's my mom's car. You know he's gonna drive your car. He better not. He's going to. He must still be making his rounds. This feels weird. What do you mean? No one's seen Blake. Henry's behind schedule. He's usually 20 minutes exactly. Maybe he ran into Blake. It's a big park. Come on, we'll walk. So, what are you gonna do when the park closes. I'm not sure. I mean, this was just a high school job and stuff. So, probably graduate high school. Go to college, get a career. Those are some big plans. I've been here for 15 years. It's all I know anymore. Mr. Hyde, he's done everything to try to keep this place open, but the money's just not coming in. I guess people don't care about amusement parks these days. I guess different times. I guess. I'd give anything to keep this place open, even just a little while longer. I'm guess I'm gonna have to start thinking of a new career. Hey, thanks for coming around with me. This place gets really creepy at night. Not a problem, happy to help. Can't let a young lady walk around a dark amusement park by herself. - Oh! - Oh, sorry, sorry. Oh, no way. Manager Martin is in the party? I see you're using the women's now. We were just talkin', Marty. The party's in the lounge. Let's keep it in there. Yeah, it's really sad about the park. But you know, I'm sure you'll find something. Yeah, it's not the end of the world. I'm sure we'll both find something. So, Blake. Any ideas? Well, his car is still here, so he has to be somewhere. So, there's something that I wanted to ask you. Um, I think we should get back to the party. What? The lights in the haunted house are on. And? I coulda sworn I turned 'em off. Where are you going? I'm gonna go turn the lights off. But... Babe, just fire it up. I'll be right back. Okay, this is the end of the park. I give up. Stupid question, but have you thought about just calling him? Yes, I called him and I got his voicemail. Although, that would've been a lot easier. Well, let's head back to the party. We'll have some fun and wait for him there. Hey, who is that? It's not one of my actors. I don't recognize the outfit either. I don't like this. What do we do? We should go. No, no, I wanna see who that is. What are you gonna do? Oh, there's another one. Who are these people? No idea. We have to tell the others. Hey, Blake. Tony? Tony? Don't freak out. Don't freak out. Carlee. Carlee. Fuck! Boo. Oh, hey. Tired of the little show? Well, after 45 minutes it does start to get old. God, I can't wait to be done with this place. It's not that bad. Yeah, that's easy for you to say. You don't have molester Marty watching over you. Or the female duo of Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum to put up with. Just 'cause they don't like Twilight? You know sometimes, when I'm here at work, I just fantasize about being crushed in the gears of a ride. Neat. Hello? Is someone there? Can you help me? This isn't fuckin' funny. Get me outta here. Who the fuck are you? What the fuck did you do to Carlee? What are you doing? I'm working. This had better not be a joke. Not me. What the fuck? There's someone in the park. Yeah, his name is woody. He'd appreciate if you left. Who is it? There are people in the park. They're wearing masks. Jen, this isn't funny. I'm being serious. It's that little geek messin' around outside, playin' his jokes. No, no. There were two people. There were two people in masks. I don't like this. Where's everybody else? Where's Rhodie? See, exactly. It's the little asshole. How do we know the masked person isn't just Rhodie and Blake messing around? No, no, I don't think so. I think we have to call the police. Whoa, whoa, wait. I bought all that booze with a fake ID and we have a bunch of underagers here. I can't find my phone. Am I the only thinking logically here? Let me try the office. I think you're gettin' a little jumpy about this. The phone's dead! I can't call out. - Is that-- - Blood? This is weird. No it's not, Allison, it's stupid. We have to go for help. Knock yourself out. I'm puttin' an end to this shit. Where are you going? I'm gonna find the geek and punch him in the mouth. Roy, wait. This isn't a joke. We have to get a hold of the police. Are you fuckin' kidding me? You girls can stay here, get your panties knotted, freak out. I'm gonna go find the geek and kick his ass. 911, what is your emergency? Hello? Hello, is anyone there? Hello? Do you need us to send a patrol car? Stay on the line as we try to trace your location. I don't think Roy's coming back. We can't call for help, so we have to leave. What about Roy? Allison, we have to get to the police, okay? These men could be dangerous. And you just wanna leave Roy? No, he'll be fine, okay. We should leave now. He can catch up. That's not a park lock. Someone doesn't want us to get out. Help! Help us! Maybe we can go up and over. Maybe. Here, give me your foot. Go! Run! Kitchen. Are you hungry? Take this. What am I supposed to do with this? Use it. Jesus, Rhodie, what the fu... I saw you come in here. Oh my God. Oh my God. It's not mine, I'm okay. It's Tony's. What happened? Tony's dead. Where's Missi? I don't know. She ran off. We gotta get outta here. What is it? If someone was out there the security light would turn on. Shit, it's just a freezer. We can't get out this way. Hi there. Don't go just yet. Look at that purty mouth. Look at you. Look at you, puttin' up a fight. Go on and fight, you purty mouth. That's okay. Fightin' just makes the blue knot tighter. Hey, ugly. Rhodie. Where's Allison? Allison. What ya doin', boy? Playin' cowboy? You know what happens to cowboys, don't ya? They get scalped. I'm your cowboy. I'm gonna save ya. We're gonna ride off into the sunset. Wait, what's that? Woo woo woo woo woo woo! Injuns! I'm dead. Looks like it's just you and me now. How is it? There goes my Olympic sprinting career. Can you walk? No, no, I don't think so. Wait, there's a wheelchair over at the first aid station. That's on the other side of the park. Maybe you can go get it. I'll wait here. No, I'm not leaving you here, okay? There's a better place we can hide. Ogre, where you be, dummy? You dented can. I oughta leave your ass in here. Come on, party's not over. Shh, quiet. Wait. - What? What, now's our chance. He might be coming right back. We can't just-- No, that's a risk we have to take, okay? Help. It's Allison. Wait here. Are you okay? Come on. Marty! Come on. Marty! Marty! Marty, over here, Marty! Marty, help! Henry? No one's home. What the hell were you doing back there? I, I panicked. You panicked? Allison is dead if ya haven't noticed! Everyone except us is either dead or missing. Ah! And you know what? You've been acting strange all night. What's going on? I think that you know something. I don't know what's happening. I have no idea what's going on. Wait, wait, wait. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. There's one thing, just one thing. This didn't occur to me until just now, okay? This was, like, months ago. A couple months back I was in town to see Mr. Hyde, the park owner. Ah, Marty, come on in. Mr. Hyde, I have last month's numbers right here. Ah, good. Right on time. Take a seat. Looks like more of the same to me. People just don't want to go to the amusement park anymore. They have their own massive budgets, expenses. Everybody's cutting back. It could just be the summer season, sir. Maybe come fall-- We just don't have enough revenue coming in to keep Fright Land open that long, Marty. It's as simple as that. People don't want to ride roller coasters and brave haunted houses. They're happy to ride the sofa and brave the commercials. If only we could bring in a new ride or promotions or something. Oh, we need to go way beyond that, Marty. We need something novel, something different. You see, when my father first opened Fright Land, he could bring people here and there in droves just by opening a new ride. They all wanted to be here just to see the latest thing. That's what we need. Like what? Something that people would have to come here to experience. Something big. Almost like... Like an accident. I'm sorry, sir, what kind of accident? Suppose something sensational were to happen right here in the park. Something terrible even. People love bad news, don't they? They can't get enough of it, they lap it up. Everybody would want to come here to be in the place where it happened. Think of the news coverage. Think of the publicity! We could theme the rides! We could sell souvenirs! It'd be the talk of the town and we would have an attraction here that no other amusement park would have. Get your photograph taken right here where-- I'm sorry, sir, I'm afraid I still don't follow. An accident? Would this be, like, a promotional event? Like a coupon day? Oh no, Marty. Much more than that. We would never have to worry about profits again. And you didn't say anything! I didn't known he meant killing all of us. I thought he meant staging something. Like what? I don't know. Just not this. It's the Manson family all over again. Who is out there? I don't know. He probably hired some backwoods yokels to come to the park to come in here and... For what? For profits? For... So this place can make money? Is that what this is about? Keeping this place open? He thought people would flock to this place if they knew it was famous for murder. Allison and Tony are dead, don't you get that? Now he's coming. We can't stay here. What are we gonna do? Maybe we can stay here, barricade the doors, wait until dawn. We can't. Eventually they'll know we're in here. I can't go anywhere on this. I don't know. Oh my God. Oh my God, Henry. Oh Jesus. Wait, he had a gun. Henry had a gun. Yeah, and he still has it on him. We need it. You mean go outside and get it? It would give us a chance, wouldn't it? That is a lot of park to cover. Any shortcuts? Maintenance tunnels, anything? Maps, layouts. What are you gonna do with it? Just shoot them? Whatever I have to do. I see them. They're over by the arcade. The roller coaster's on the other side of the park. If you're going, go now. What are you gonna do? I'll be fine. I'll lock up behind you. Go. Hey! What you doin', fudge pack? Get down here and help me with this last one. Unh, unh, unh. Come on, piddle pug. Come on, it's gonna be okay. Come on, it's gonna be okay. It'll be all right, come on. Get over here. Come on. Get your ass up here, you fuckin' bitch. Come on, that way. Hm, you got a pretty little ass on you, girl. We're gonna take a little walk. How can you do this? What? Murder? Huntin' deer, huntin' people, it's the same thing. Where is that lard ass? Easy girl, just you relax. It won't be much more than a few minutes, then old Ogre's gonna have his turn. No. Hey! Go! Run! You fucking motherfucker. You better kill me, boy. Don't you worry about that! Go get her! Roy! Look what you did! You bitch! You fuckin'... Ooh yeah! Yeah! Oh! You bitch! Come here, you bitch. Little princess, I got somethin' for you. Fuckin' gonna cut ya to bits. Get down here, you little sack of meat! Where are you, little pig? Okay, girly, let's end this. Time to die. Aw, fuck! Where you goin', sweetmeat? Guess we'll have to do this the old-fashioned way. That's okay with me. My eyes! My eyes, you bitch. Information is just coming in about what the authorities are calling the Fright Land massacre. Details are sketchy at this point... Yeah, that's all of it. Thanks, take it easy. Look at that mob. This place is gonna make a fortune. How's she doin', doc? Ah, she'll be fine. Few stitches, couple of bruises, nothin' major. Can I go? Uh, yeah. Just try to get some rest. Let me grab my jacket. I can give you a ride home. Stay here. I just left it inside the office. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
