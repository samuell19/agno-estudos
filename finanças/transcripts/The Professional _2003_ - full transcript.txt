A man is Iooking for you. He's Iooking a bit strange. You have lipstick aIl over you as though you kissed a vampire Who is it? -lt seems to me he's not a writer. He certainly is a writer. Everybody writes these days and nobody looks Iike a writer anymore. -What shouId I telI him? -TelI him I'm out l've already toId him so. He said he knows that you're out, but that you should see him anyway. -He didn't come for his sake. -For whose sake did he come? l don't know. He's carrying a briefcase and a big suitcase. The Iunatics were bringing their manuscripts in foIders tiIl now He Iooks like he arrived by train a IittIe whiIe ago Maybe he is some cousin of yours. -That's very nice! He Iooks strange, wearing a black suitcase and he might be my cousin? -You didn't understand me A man couId live in this town for a hundred years and someone wiIl always teIl him he's a stranger, a peasant. My grandfather was a peasant and l Ioved him more than anyone He asked me, if his oId buddy Teja was here Let him in, but caIl me in five minutes Make a lunch reservation for half past two.

Can l put the suitcase down? -Of course Take a seat -No, thank you I'm in a hurry -Are you maybe. -A friend from the army? Do you remember your story ''My friend from the army''? -My story? -Yes. When a man came to you on the street, hugged you and asked, ''Do you see some of the boys?'' You were confused, as you are now, and asked him, ''What boys''? ''WelI, the boys from the army.'' You felt better, at least you had some information So you said, ''Of course I do.'' ''And who do you see most frequently?'' You said, ''I often see Marko Sedlar.'' The man looked at you, Iowered his eyes and said, ''I am Marko SedIar'' An interesting story, but unfortunateIy it's not mine Yes, it's yours. You just forgot it Excuse me, but who are you? What's your name? My name is Luka Laban lt seems it doesn't ring a belI? Mister Luka, aren't you by any chance mistaken? There are severaI men here caIled Teodor. But onIy you're calIed Teodor Teja Kraj. Only you are from Sid and your mother is from Sumanovic's family.

And after the meeting, if you survive, you're going to Iunch with your secretary and girIfriend Martha -How do you know that? -Today is your 48th birthday lt is Mister Luka, you had bound those manuscripts by some book binder? l didn't dare. My daughter did that and l wrote the titIes They often Iose or ruin manuscripts? -Even more They sometimes denounce you to the police, if something is ''especialIy interesting''. -They do The police shouId work for the peopIe, not otherwise -Right What are those books about? This bIue book has the title ''Orations''. Short and sweet -AIl four books are Orations? -The green on is a colIection of short stories ''Stories from the Iost home'' The black book is a coIlection of urban stories. Something like Chekhov's stories -You like Chekhov? -And who doesn't? Chekhov wrote the story ''Sadness'' based on my Iife. That book is particuIarly interesting. l see. A large book. -Pigs are Iarge, and books are voIuminous. You used to telI that to your students as a professor of literature. ls that right? -Yes. Unbelievable. Splendid. -Just one question, sir -But can l ask you something?

He's yeIling at me like l'm that wife of his. -Why are you shouting, Jovan? -She won't Iet me in, Iike you are The President of the United States! And how do you think you could get in without an appointment? Did you visit the ex-manager whenever you wanted to? l did not -You've been seeing him once a year And now you're bursting in here, yeIling your guts out! You are Iate for the meeting.

My regular job in daytime and this during the night Do you have perhaps more manuscripts in the suitcase? No The suitcase contains Iots of stuff. -What stuff? Lighters, keys, gIasses, gloves, caps. Caps? Are there many of them? -WeIl, about a dozen or so. -Do you like caps? l've never wore them As you see, I'm wearing a hat. l've coIlected these caps. And lots of other stuff. The suitcase is so fuIl, that I bareIy closed it Comrade Luka, l'm gIad to meet you l'm going to read alI this and you can come by in two or three weeks -l'm sorry, I can't -Why not? l'm going to have a surgery. They're scheduling it today -ls it something serious? -No. If I survive What shouId I do with your books? -They're not my books. Not yours? - No -But whose are they?

Don't Iaugh, pIease l just thought you're a serious man and you're bringing me my books. Don't Iaugh I'm Luka Laban, a retired policeman. A poIiceman? -Retired major of the State Security. You have been ''my case'' for ten years l've been foIlowing you for ten years, every day Those are your Orations, your stories and your encounters and discussions whiIe you were a so calIed dissident. l've been foIlowing you, taping you, Iistening in to your phone calIs and I've been ''taking down'' aIl this from the tapes -And one day.. -What happened one day? Nothing. What happened one day? After October 5th my daughter asked for your file. From the fiIe she made aIl those books, before she went to Canada Forever Your daughter was working for the police too? l asked if your daughter was working for the police. -Anna is your daughter? -Yes -Your daughter? -Yes, my daughter. -You must be joking -Why shouId I? -Where did you get these from? -l took them Some in the Iine of duty, some privately. -My God, Anna's your daughter -She was my daughter. -What do you mean, ''she was''? -She went to Canada and got married there I didn't see her since, she doesn't caIl. Why doesn't she caIl you? l wanted to kilI you after October 5th when you came to power by force, but she didn't Iike it You wanted to kiIl me? -Several times in the line of duty, but when your peopIe forced me out of service, privately. -You're joking. -No, I never joke. The workers are calIing you to get down to the printing shop. They're threatening with demonstrations. And that geek told me to fuck off He toId me alI sort of things -The president of the committee? Now I've had it! Do you know what he said to me? That l'm a whore -What's the extension? -220. Put the president of the striking committee on Martha, please, don't cry. Boss, it's for you!

Yes PartIy hereditary, partly because of you -Because of me? -He knew about your affair. That's why Martha is afraid of lunatics. -And how do you know alI that? -lt's my job to know everything. lf l'd kilIed you during the March demonstrations in '91 as I pIaned, that man wouId be alive. And maybe he wouldn't. They say that suicide is destined. And why did you want to kilI me in '91 ? Because you wanted to force down the Government and our President You took the students out on the streets! You burned and wrecked Belgrade! -Who wrecked Belgrade? You, your friends and your students! MARCH 9TH 1 991 200.000 DEMONSTRATORS AGAINST MILOSEVIC The first time I saw you in the Security Department You covered the whole city with cameras! More or Iess Except maybe a few toilets. Marko, who is this pig? A professor at the Faculty of Philosophy, Teodor Kraj. Students calI him Teja This pIatform is free! -A professor? -Yes -Fucking smart ass Stop. Zoom in. You traitorous motherfucker! You're the one to bring us freedom! And this piece of shit is a professor of what? -PhiIosophy, l suppose -PhiIosophy? l didn't beat a philosopher before l typed your first speech in my office and opened your fiIe, that wiIl turn into these books. Good evening, Serbia! Did you manage to get some sIeep? l've just begun, but I'm going to need more time. But I'm satisfied What did these days and nights on the square mean to you? You've opened my file with a story about freedom? What freedom are you taIking about, man? Read what you've said You've insulted everything and everyone. Afterward I asked my superior to let me run you over with the car The first time you get drunk, l couId run you over Iike a dog -Like a dog? Like a common street dog. But my superior was a kind man. He said, ''Luka, we shouId keep the streets cIean.'' lf your boss approved, you wouId realIy run me over? You'd be history You wouId be neither the first nor the last. -There were so many ''accidents'' -But why, man? l was a communist to the bone in those years And you spoke aIl kinds of shit about communists. ln your Oration about a monkey you said about communists, ''Nature needed a milIion years to make a man out of a monkey, but the Communism needed only fifty years to turn a man into a monkey again'' -Splendid! I said that? -And when was that? -Here. November 1 5th 1 993 l was seIling newspapers that night. -ReaIly? l couIdn't come to your table and say, ''l'm a policeman. Let me sit with you and listen to what are you taIking about.'' -l don't remember anything -Of course You were dead-drunk. l say, ''What's up, pigs? What do you want?'' One of them jumps aIl over me, hits me with a club in the head. -ln the head! -Back here. Hawk, over! The bastard is in the bar. l scream from anger and pain, jump on my feet, hit one of them, than the other one, and the other one. How many fucking cops were there? Thirty or forty of them at least. Forty against one! Forty against a poet! l get upset and yeIl, ''You eviIdoers, shame on you!'' And I start to run and jump through a closed window The glass falIs aIl over the pIace, l'm flying, falIing. My whoIe Iife flashes before my eyes. l see my mother, my father, my brother. l'm falIing, faIling. -How many stories did you falI from? l don't know, but it was very high WilI someone lick this for me? Fucking fascists! You're lucky to be alive. Hawk, roger! Hawk is entering the bar Tomorrow's papers. SIobodan MiIosevic in Nis. Good evening. Mister Protic, is it not? l've recognized you from TV.

One raspberry juice, if you have it -Of course. Raspberry juice, man! l don't drink aIcohoI because of my throat And how do you feel when you drink raspberry juice? l feeI good. -You don't have ''epsileptic'' seizures? -What? -Are you deaf? Raspberry is known to attack the hearing! The man is such an idiot Listen to what he's saying: ''Serbia wiIl be one of Europe's most deveIoped countries in five years, a role model for many countries.'' God damn it! This could drive a man crazy! lt's not SIoba's fauIt We are shit! Nature needed a miIlion years to make a man out of a monkey, but the Communism needed only fifty years to turn a man into a monkey again -A baboon too! Bare-bottomed! That's right. -Give me a gIass of wine. l'm not feeling welI Do you think that we drink because we Iike to? Do you see what they say here? l don't read papers, l just selI them You're poisoning peopIe You're a mobile Chernobyl. Leave the man aIone, he didn't write that shit Drug deaIers don't make the drugs, just selI them That's right.. That's correct! Do you know the song ''Government wilI faIl''? Never heard of it ''What is that that's faIling? lt's the Government and you'' ''Many governments have falIen So yours must faIl too.'' GentIemen, pIease, l have five children. Mister Teja, please don't sing so loud. The bar is fulI of poIice Who is a cop here? They'lI send an inspection, they'Il cIose my bar l have three smaIl children. l'm saying this because of your smaIl children! What wilI happen if the Satrap stays in power for another ten years? They'lI Ieave this rotten country! -You'Il stay aIone like graves! -Please, they are everywhere. -My cook is his man. -My fiddIer played for him lt's not SIoba's fauIt! We are shit! We'Il pIay for you alI night, just don't mention comrade Sloba AIl right PIay that old foIk song ''Love letter'' That's okey Come on! Sing! Enough! Closing time! l have to wash my face. l'm not feeling welI First l'm going to wash my face and then hang myself. l can't stand this Iife anymore We have to fight, man, don't kilI yourself now! l wanted to hang you l had an excelIent alibi, because you said it yourseIf in front of everybody l foIlowed you to the bathroom and I see you taking a piss. The man looked just Iike you from behind. Boy, you're drunk! l took off my beIt, made a noose and put it around your neck to hang you lt's okey, Martha, we're just talking. He wanted to strangle you. -He was just expIaining something Comrade Luka, do you want some coffee? -If it's possibIe WeIl, it's not possible. They just arrested the cook. Teja, he's crazy. Should l calI the poIice? No, no.. They arrested JeIena, the cook? -They're taking her away now. -Why did they arrest her? She poured hot coffee into the doorman's eyes. -l'lI make you coffee. -No sugar for me, pIease Don't worry Everything's under controI ls it possible that you wanted to hang me in the bathroom and make it Iook Iike a suicide? There were many questionable suicides. Dostoevsky wrote about that when the oId Karamazov.. Wait a minute You are not a poIiceman You doubt that l'm a policeman? ls that a compliment? You don't taIk like a policeman. Your knowIedge about Chekov, Dostoevski, about Iiterature don't become a policeman. My dear Mister Teja! lf you only knew how hard it was for me to comprehend the basic concepts of that Iiterary worId of yours l was convinced that AristotIe, Kafka, Nietzsche, Hegel were aIl agents of foreign inteIligence services. l even came across similar names in police fiIes of embassies employees. When you quoted Sartre, l was sure he was the French military attache His name was aIso Jean-Paul, only he wasn't a phiIosopher. So I added in his file: ''and a philosopher''. What could l do? Of alI foreign names l've heard onIy of Marx, Engels and Lenin You stiIl doubt that l'm telIing the truth? WeIl.. And how's your leg? -What leg? -The left one. You had severe fracture of the thighbone. -Yes And two surgeries. The Ieg is 4 cm shorter, your right shoe soIe 4 cm thicker At first sight one can't see you have a limp l quit smoking, I had three by-passes. l carry the lighter out of the habit. Keep it, it's yours anyway. -How do you know about my Ieg? -l know I hit you with my car You hit me with your car? And you got off easy. lf l'd been driving a jeep, it wouId've taken them three days to put you together You are a monster! A murderer! -l didn't kilI anyone. -l spent a year in a hospital! l had four surgeries! Not two, four! They've bareIy managed to save my leg! Look what you did to me, you filthy cop! Take a Iook! And here is what you did to me, you mangy pig! Martha! Martha! -What are you doing? -We're talking. Why are you taking off your clothes? l'm showing him my scar from the surgery -And he's showing me his. -Why do you do that? What do you want? Martha, everything's going to be fine. l'lI finish this conversation in five minutes. -You know how much I love you? -l know But who is that man? l'lI teIl you alI about it at lunch Kiss you -Five minutes? -Five. Jovan, come here! Hurry up! -What's up? -He's a pervert! l couIdn't believe my eyes. She was lying Iike this. Boss. PeopIe, do you see this circus? Believe me, lf l had a gun, l wouId kilI you Take mine. The buIlet is in the hole, just squeeze the trigger. You know I can calI the Chief of The State Security now. So? -You'd spent the rest of your life in prison. Prison is for people. l've sent at least a hundred men there. Most of them are now in power because they served time. And you were given some position after being run over l did you a favor and you want to kilI me -lt's not right. -You're not normal. Cheers. ls it possible that you wanted to kilI me because of MiIosevic? Partly because of him, but more because of Knin. Because of Knin? l ran you over the second day after Knin feIl. l was in shock, l wanted to kilI aIl of you! August 1 995 Exodus of Serbs from Croatia Milan, why don't you Iet these poor peopIe into the city? What do you think, who can forbid? -Who has forbidden? -The President, they say -The President? Where are the people supposed to go? -The order is, to Kosovo. -To Kosovo? And where from Kosovo if a war breaks out down there? How am I suppose to know, Luka? Boss, that professor and some of his men are organizing a ralIy -That's forbidden Yes, but they are gathering in the HalI of Sports. They expect over twenty thousand peopIe to come They're plotting to go to the President's house -They're mentioning guns too. -Guns? And the ''Rumanian scenario.'' As though this misery is not enough for them, they want blood in BeIgrade too. WeIl, l'm going to show them the ''Serbian scenario''! A milIion peopIe should have been on the streets of BeIgrade tonight! The processions of wretches are passing by our houses! 500.000 men, women and children are looking at our windows They're not aIlowed to go into the MiIosevic's Imperial City! That's right. -What else must happen to us. How many of our people are there? -More than a half. l'm going to take down this professor tonight ..and if he sleeps, what is he dreaming about? Does he dream about so many wounded and dead peopIe? Shame on us before Nikola TesIa, who's Iooking at us and asking, ''Where is my native soil, brothers?'' Milosevic is not to bIame! We're to blame, we're shit! He knows that we're shit! When he gets tired of us, he just fIushes, and shit goes down the toiIet! Who is shit, you motherfucker?! Easy Here, caIm down. Those bastards broke my Ieg. Let go of me -l'm going to kilI him! -Come on! -Let go of me! -AIl right! Teja.. Teja, damn it! Teja, damn it! You bastards! -Do you have a fever? -Leave the man aIone. What do you mean? He was Iucky. They put my healthy leg in the cast first Later they got it right and now it's OK, thank God l said, Iet's go to the bar! Politics wiIl kilI us -Nice shirt -What was that? -l said, nice shirt -He said you have a nice shirt My uncIe gave it to me Good evening, gentIemen How are you? -Good evening, doctor. -How are you, mister Kraj? GentIemen, you must Ieave. Visiting hours are over. No probIem, doctor. What happened, young man? Soccer? -Yes, but soccer with clubs. -Very nice. Hang on, Teja! Everything's going to be aIl right -You're a big hero! -Let's go. Mister Kraj, excelIent! No fever, as l see. -No constipation, excelIent! -What's exceIlent, doctor? You were in criticaI condition Iast night -We thought that we lost you. -You thought l'lI die? WeIl, it was a cIose shave A spIendid diagnosis: a cIose shave Nurse, put it here Do they know who hit me? They'lI find out Papers say, the investigation is underway The investigation is underway and the funeraI is tomorrow. You must have fate in our poIice department. l'm afraid that investigation is being led by those, who run me over. Who is paying you to hate our President so much? Who is paying me? l mean, who is your contact abroad? You can teIl me. l'm under a doctor's oath l fear that someone might hear us. We're alone You can whisper it to me. -This is a plastic ear -You're joking. Unbelievable. lt Iooks real. No one wouId think it was plastic. And who'd think you have one shorter leg? -True This would aIso be aggravated assault and battery in court Let's part with a drink The workers are waiting for me. -Cheers, comrade Luka. -Cheers, Mister Teja. -What are those? -Your things. My things? -Like those are your books, these are your things -What do you think? -Where did you get alI this? l colIected them whiIe l've been foIlowing you for ten years.
