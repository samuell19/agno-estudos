[♪] MAN: Let me get my hands on you! You get out of here! STOOGES: Whoooa! MAN: Now beat it! And you mugs don't get your stuff till you pay up your back rent! He can't do that to us just because we're eight months behind. But he did. I'm going back and getting my other shirt. Get my other pair of socks. They're behind the stove. Right. Yeah, but he won't let us in. Hey, listen to this: "Man collects $30,000 damages from hotel. Slips on cake of soap in lobby and gets huge judgment." All we need is a cake of soap and we're in business. Let's go up and get one. Wait a minute. He won't let us in. Oh, he won't, eh? [BARKS] Feel that muscle. Very good. I'll tear him limb from limb. I'll chop him to ribbons. I'll wreck him. I'll crush him. I'll give him the-- I'll give-- Believe me. Come on. [ALL WHIMPERING] ALL: Whoooa. Ow! Oh. Oh. Look: soap. Just what we're looking for. Oh, boy. Let's go. Boy, this is it: a hotel. I can feel the money jingling in my pocket now. Start slipping. We start suing. Keep your eyes peeled for anybody. Go ahead. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Hey. Why don't you mind your own business? [BARKS, IMITATES MACHINE GUN] The nerve of some people. He came outta nowhere. Now, you work with me, I'll see that you're put in a tub and nobody uses you. [PANTS] [FRUSTRATED WHINE] Why, you dummy. Don't you dare hit me in the head. You know I'm not normal. Oh! Why... [FRUSTRATED WHINE] [GRUNTING] See that? Oh! Now, why don't you do things right? I've been trying. But the soap is too big. "Soap is too big." Get your leg up here. [GRUNTS] Here. Now do things right. Hey, porcupine. [WHISTLES] [GRUNTS] Hmmm. [SNORTS] [BURPS] [DOOR CLOSES] Hey, you. Quit eating your lunch. We got some things-- [DINGING] A tourist. Good afternoon, Mr. Scroggins. Won't you come in? Never mind the formality. What about the interest on your note? Well, here's $52, Mr. Scroggins. It's all I have. [SOBBING] You know, business has been very bad, but I'm doing the very best I can. I haven't time to listen to your excuses. You have the rest in 10 days, or I'm taking this dump over. But people won't stop here unless the place is fixed up, and I haven't any money to do it with. We gotta help that poor old lady. Come on. Wait a minute, shylock. She'll have the money on time. Yeah, and I'll see that you get it too. Me, myself, I, personally. I'll guarantee it, see? SCROGGINS: And who are you? Who is he? Why, he's one of the biggest steelmen in the country. He'd "steal" anything-- I mean, his steel is known from coast to coast. Willy Steel. And how. Is that your hat? Yes. Why don't you get your head simonized? [WHISTLES] [WATER SPLASHES] [SPUTTERING] Just for that, I'll dispossess you. [LAUGHING] Oh, boys. Now, don't worry, Mom. He can't dispossess you for 30 days. And by that time, we'll have you on easy street. Oh, how can I ever thank you? Don't try. By the way, here's $52 I just found in my hand. Why, that's the amount I gave Mr. Scroggins. Now, ain't that a coincidence? Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. We'll take care of everything. You go see a movie. Oh, thank you. Single feature. Say, did you notice the beautiful watch Scroggins had on? Notice it? I got it. Nyuck, nyuck. This will buy paint and wallpaper. I won't need this soap anymore. Come on, fellas, let's go. I got the whole thing-- Oh! Oh! Oh! Hey. Hey, kid. Are you hurt? Yeah, but I don't care. [LAUGHS WILDLY] Come on. Get a move on.

But if he knocks the place, Mrs. Brown will lose her hotel. You get him seated, we'll get the show started. It better be good. Let's go. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. I hope you'll enjoy our new place, Mr. Twitchell. Thank you. Good evening, friends. I would call you ladies and gentlemen, but you know what you are. [ALL CHUCKLE] Whew. Tough audience.

Oh, I'm all ready. I wasn't talking to you, Balbo. Relax. I'll call you when I want you. Come here, blubberhead. Haven't you got more brains than to walk off a stage when you're entertaining? Besides, we gotta help the old lady. Now get out there and mingle with the guests. Listen, you -- Mingle, or I'll mangle. Oh, that's different. He don't know the show must go on. Well.
