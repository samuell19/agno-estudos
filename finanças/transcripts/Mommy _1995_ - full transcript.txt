Do you mind? - Yes ma'am. - Thank you. The award is for outstanding student of the year, you have straight A's perfect attendance. - But mommy-- - No buts about it, dear. Is that little Mexican in the talented and gifted group? No. - It's just a student plaque, I don't need another I got one last year. - And the year before, and the year before that and you deserve it again this year. I think, maybe this should be a private conference. - Mommy, please, please don't embarrass me. - I would never do that. Who's your best friend? (sighing) - You are. - Who loves you more than anything on God's green earth? (soft music) - You do mommy. - That's right, now, you run along, I'll meet you on the playground. - Yes mommy. - Jessica Anne! - Yes mommy. - Posture. - (sighs) Yes mommy. (door knocking) - Good afternoon Mrs. Sterling. I hope you don't mind if I continue with the decorating. The Spring Festival means so much to the children. - We did have an appointment for a conference. - Mrs. Sterling, we had our conference for the quarter just last week. I would like to get these decorations up for the children. So if you don't mind, we'll talk as I work. - I don't mind. You're presenting the plaque at the PTA meeting tomorrow evening. - That's right. - You know that my daughter deserves this award. - Your daughter is a wonderful student. So is Eduardo Melendez - Are his grades as good as Jessica Ann's? - Actually, Mrs. Sterling, that's none of your business. Neither is how I arrived at who the year's outstanding student is. - Really? - Really. Eduardo faces obstacles that your daughter does not. And when someone like Eduardo excels, it's important that he receive recognition. - Because he's a Mexican? You're punishing my daughter because she's white, and comes from a good family. (sighing) - Well, now, I don't look at it that way. When a person of color like Eduardo. - You're not going to give this award to Jessica Ann are you? (tense music) - It's been decided. - There's no name on the plaque. It's not too late for you to do the right thing. - It is too late. What are you teaching your daughter with behavior like this as an example? - Well, what are you teaching her? By taking something that's rightfully hers and giving it to somebody, just because he's a person of color. (sighing) - I have nothing more to say to you Mrs Sterling! Good afternoon. (foreboding music) (screaming) (tense music) - Is something the matter? - Yes, there's been a terrible accident. When I went to see Mrs. Withers, she was lying on the floor. She'd been up the ladder decorating the room for you children. - Oh mommy, oh no! - She must have been a very thoughtful teacher. - Mommy, and you make it sound like she's-- - Dead, yes, she's dead dear. I think she may have broken her neck. (crying) Well, I stopped by the office and asked the Secretary to phone for an ambulance. I think maybe we should wait until help comes, don't you? - Yes mommy. Why did they call for an ambulance I wonder? Mrs. Withers was dead. What good would the doctor do? - People die dear, it's natural. - What's so natural about falling off the ladder? - Is that a smarty tone? - No Mommy. - Because I don't think Mrs. Withers would like you speaking to your mother in a smarty tone. - No mommy. - Anyway, people fall off ladders all the time. All the time. More accidents happen at home, than anywhere else. - Mommy, Can we go now? - No dear, I will have to speak to these gentlemen first. (911 operator speaking) (upbeat music) - Mr. Spellman. - March. What are you doing here? This isn't a murder investigation. - We'll get to that later where is our witness? - [Jessica Ann Voiceover] They asked mommy questions for a long time, Lieutenant March seemed grouchy, I don't think he wanted to be there. - [Lieutenant March] Well why don't you answer me? - [Jessica Ann Voiceover] I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but Lieutenant March had a loud voice, and it got louder. - So, you didn't speak to Mrs. Withers at all? - How could I? She was lying on the floor with her neck broken. - But you had an appointment? - Yes, a parent teacher conference. - Were you on time for the conference? - I'm never late lieutenant. Is there anything else? - No, not right now anyway. - Thank you, Lieutenant. You have my address, my number. - Oh yeah, I got your number. - Let's go dear, Your Aunt Beth is waiting dinner. (melancholy music) - So what's your story? (upbeat music) - [Jessica Ann Voiceover] Our house on Rockwall road was really cool. We lived here for two years ever since mummy married Mr. Sterling. Mr. Sterling was really old 60, the paper said when he died, but mommy loved him a lot. He had an insurance agency and was kind of rich or anyway, we always kind of thought he was. I heard mommy tell Aunt Beth, that Mr. Sterling wasn't as rich as he pretended to be, plus, a lot of his money and property and stuff went to his kids, or those other two witches he married. Oh, only mommy didn't say witches. Aunt Beth was really cool. We've been seeing a lot of her since she divorced Uncle Bob and moved to that apartment. - Oh, you poor dear, you poor dear. Did she see? - No, I discovered the body, Jessica Ann was on the playground. - Oh, thank God. Do either of you even feel like eating? - Not really? - Jessica Ann! Your aunt came all the way over here at the last minute to fix us some supper. - Don't worry about that. - Smells like spaghetti. - That's what it is. I made a big bowl of Italian salad too. - Can I just go in my room please? - No, no, a little unpleasantness is not going to stand in the way of good nutrition. - Please if she doesn't want-- - Now you march in there, young lady. - Yes mommy. - Your salad too. - Yes mommy. - Don't you ever contradict me in front of my daughter again. You know how impressionable young girls can be. (tense music) - [Jessica Ann Voiceover] But I didn't eat much. All I could think of was Mrs. Withers and how nice she was, and how she was dead now. (door knocking) - Mind if I come in? (soft music) Don't feel bad about crying, It's good to get it out of your system. - Do you think Mrs. Withers had any children? - Probably, maybe even grandchildren. - Do you think I should write them a letter? - Why dear? - To tell them what a good teacher she was. (soft music) - I think that's a wonderful idea. - I'll write it tonight, and add their names later, Aunt Beth, do you remember, when Mr. Sterling wanted me to call him daddy? - Well sure honey, what about it? I told him that I didn't wanna call him that, and I'm afraid it might have hurt his feelings, and now he's dead. (crying) - I'm sure he understood. - I never explained it. It's just that I still call my real Daddy, daddy. I talk to him at night. I was only six when he drowned in that accident. But I still remember him real good. - Sure you do. - I was mad at mommy for marrying Mr. Sterling. - That's only natural dear. - But sometimes, I don't think she misses either one of them. Daddy or Mr. Sterling. - You know, Jessie your mother, she's kind of a special person. - I know. She's very smart and pretty. - She has some wonderful qualities. - She does everything for me. - She does a lot for you, but she doesn't always feel things like maybe she should. - What do you mean? - It's hard to explain. She was pampered a lot. There were four of us, you know, but she was the first and favorite. Your grandparents, rest their souls gave her everything. And why not? She was so pretty, so perfect. - She always got her way didn't she? - And how did you know that? - 'Cause she still does. - Jessie, I always kind of looked after your mother, protected her. - What do you mean Aunt Beth? - It's just as you grow older, try to understand. Try to forgive her if she seems well-- - Cold? (soft music) - Just remember in her way, she loves you very much. - Yeah. - Am I interrupting? - No, not at all, just girl talk. - Isn't that sweet? But not as sweet as chocolate cake Anybody interested? - Is Mark here? I thought I heard his car. - Right downstairs. - So, what do you think? - Yeah. - Mark and chocolate cake, that's a combo few girls could resist. (soft music) - There's my girl, Well come on. Are you okay angel? - Sure. - Your mom told me about today, it's awful rough. - I'm fine Mark, really. - Step into my office. Angel. If you need somebody to talk to-- - Mark, I'm fine, really? - You know when I was 10 my boy scout leader died, he was killed in a car accident and I didn't have a dad around, he and my mom were divorced. That scout troop leader kind of became a surrogate father to me, you know what that means? - Kind of took the place of your real dad? - Right. Anyway, when he died, I felt empty. And then I started to feel afraid. - Afraid? - Mm-hmm. See, for the first time I started to think about dying, and I had trouble sleeping. And I had nightmares. And for the first time, I realized that nobody lives forever. - [Jessica Ann Voiceover] Mark was so sweet. But I had known about people done for a long time. - Anyway, if you ever have any trouble like that, I just want you to know I'm here for you. - Whose for dessert? - I am. - I am. Mommy met Mark at a country club dance. He had his own business, some kind of mail order thing. (soft music) Mommy said he moved here to get away from the urban life, where he used to live. - Wow, kill me with kindness. (laughing) - I'll just have the ice cream. - Oh, what is wrong with me? You're allergic to chocolate. How about some strawberry compote on that ice cream? - Oh, that does sound good. - There's a jar in the fridge. - Those are pretty good pearls. - Thank you honey. - [Jessica Ann Voiceover] Maybe it wasn't right to assume how Mr. Sterling died, but I hope mommy would marry Mark. I didn't think it would be so hard calling him daddy. - Oh here, let me have a crack at that. - Here. (cracking) - What do you know? Mommy's pretty strong for a girl. - Now there's a sexist remark. - I've seen her do that with ketchup bottles, pickle jars lots of times. - Remind me not to cross you. - Don't cross me. (tense music) - What's a matter Little Miss perfect get called to the principal's office? - You mind your own business? - There's some policemans waiting to talk to you. - What? - Maybe they wanna ask you what your mama was doing in Mrs. Withers room yesterday. - Everybody knows what my mother was doing in Mrs. Withers room, she found the body. - Maybe I seen your mama go in there and stay for a good long while. Maybe I heard them talking in there. - You don't know anything. - I see everything that goes on around this place, nothing gets past these eagle eyes. - You're a liar, and my minister says liars go to hell. - Don't you go talking to me like that. I'm like a teacher, you can't talk to me-- - Don't, get back to your work. Jessica Ann move along. - Yes, ma'am. - Yes I'm. (foreboding music) - Jessica Ann, you remember me? I'm Lieutenant March. Now Mrs. Evans has given us permission to use her office. Can we talk for a minute? - Okay. - Okay. - Thank you. Come on. Sit down here. Jessica Ann, Why did your mother wanna speak to Mrs. Withers yesterday? - They had a conference. - Oh, yes, the Parent Teacher Conference. - Yes, sir. - No, you don't have to call me sir Jessica Ann. Candy? - Mommy says not to take candy from strangers. - Hmm, I don't want us to be strangers, I want us to be friends. - Friend or stranger, candy rots your teeth mommy says. - Maybe, Mommies don't always know best, hmm? Jessica Ann, do you know how your teacher you died? - Fell off a ladder? - Oh yeah, she fell off a ladder, yes. But Jessica Ann your teacher died of a broken neck. - Once she fell up the ladder. - Now we have a man called a medical examiner. And he says that's not the way it happened. Mm-mm. He says it's very likely that a pair of hands did it. Now, there was something missing from Mrs. Withers desk. - Could I please go? My stomach hurts. - It was a plaque for the most outstanding student of the year which I understand that you won last year. - Yes sir. - There's that sir again. Now Mrs. Withers told a lot of her friends that your mother called up complaining that you didn't win it this year. - She thought I deserved to win. - I'm sure you did. But the mother of the boy, who won the plaque, Eduardo, Eduardo yes. Mrs. Melendez, I'm sure she'd love to have that plaque, and Eduardo. Now if you found that plaque, would you tell me? - Why would I find it? - Well, I don't know, maybe your mother took it off the desk when she was leaving the classroom. - Who said she did? - Nobody. - And anyway, that wouldn't prove anything. - Who said anything about proving anything Jessica Ann? - I think if you have any more questions for me, Lieutenant March, you should talk to my mother first. - Jessica Ann. - Try this one. Jasper bought a newspaper for 10 cents more than a fourth of $1, a card for five cents less than half of $1, and a magazine. - [Jessica Ann Voiceover] If that policeman has anything else to say, I didn't hear it. I didn't hear anything any of my friends said either or the substitute teacher. I had a lot of thoughts too, but I try not to listen to them either. (cracking) - How was school today dear? - Okay. - Anything special happen? - I talked to that policeman. - What police man? Lieutenant March? - He just has some questions. - About what dear? - Mrs. Withers, nothing special. I just hope he doesn't talk to Miss Jones. - Who? - That awful janitor. She was teasing me saying terrible things. - Like what dear? - That you were in Mrs. Withers room a long time talking to her. (tense music) - She's just a stupid woman and a menial job. Ignore her. Oh! How I hate this instant! Ah! We're out of everything in this house. I think I may make a run to the store and get some fresh ground. - Can I come along? - Why don't you just stay here and finish your homework? And maybe later we can watch a video. - Great. - I'll swing by Video factory and pick up. How about Beauty and the Beast again? - Excellent. (soft music) (foreboding music) You were bothering my daughter today? - I wasn't bother nobody. You got permission to be in here after hours? - I'm a taxpayer, I don't need your permission. - Well, you just get along about your business. - What were you saying to my daughter today? - Well, you mean that I seen you in there in Miss Withers room yesterday? That I heard you two to talking in there? - Is that what you told the police? - I didn't tell the police nothing. - I want you stay away from my daughter! - And the police, maybe I should go see them, maybe I'd get a big old horse laugh out of a fine lady like you putting up with all that bullshit. You'd make the papers and not the society page this time. - I won't have you bothering her or embarrassing me. - Maybe you should make it worth my while. (foreboding music) I know you didn't do nothing, fine lady like you, but maybe it'd be worth your while. (tense music) - God damn fuse! Let me fix those little assholes again. (both shouting frightened) - Better go get those lights fixed. - No shit Sherlock. (tense music) (coughing) (tense music) (tense music) - [Jessica Ann Voiceover] My mind is full of awful thoughts did Mr. Sterling really die of a heart attack? What really happened that afternoon when mommy and daddy went boating? - Jessica Ann! Oh, I didn't mean to startle you, honey. I'm sorry I took so long. I ran into an old friend at the store. Ready for Chinese and a movie? - Great. - Class please, I have something very important to say to you, let's all settle down now. Class please! Mrs. Evans has something to say to you. - People. I'm sorry to have to tell you that there has been another tragedy here at McKinley. Our janitor Miss Jones died last night in an unfortunate accident. - See, I told her she got fried. - [Substitute Teacher] Quiet! - [Jessica Ann Voiceover] It was my fault, wasn't it? I had told mommy about Miss Jones, and now Miss Jones is dead. Mrs. Evans said that she was arranging for counselors to help any of us who might be troubled by what had happened at McKinley lately. If I told the counselors that my mommy maybe killed my daddy and Mr. Sterling for their money, what advice would they have? - Jessica Ann. You have anything to tell me? - No sir. - [Jessica Ann Voiceover] I might be wrong and even if I wasn't, she was my mommy. But then I thought about Daddy and Mr. Sterling. And I thought of somebody else I cared for who might be in danger. (soft music) - Well, we shouldn't be any later than mid night. - Stay out as long as you like, enjoy yourselves. - You are so sweet to do this Beth, I owe you one. - I stopped keeping track a long time ago. - Good bye angel. - Bye. - Jessie Is something wrong? - No, nothing. - You do know, don't you? That there's nothing you can't talk to me about. Is it what happened at school last week? Your teacher? That janitor? - Can we watch Seinfeld? Mommy doesn't like comedies, but I do. (upbeat music) - Have you noticed anything odd about Jessica Ann lately? - Not really! - I have. For the last week or so she's been avoiding me, snubbing me even. - Oh, I never noticed that. - You don't think she's been kind of moody? - Well, maybe she's jealous. (both laughing) - What does that mean? - I think she has a little girl crush on you Mr. What's been added around the Sterling house, this last week or so? You've been staying over occasionally. Right? - Right. Right, right, right. ♪ Movin on ("Movin on") ♪ Called on a client she sure looked heaven sent ♪ ♪ She had a husband - Don't be to surprised to see me here, this is where all the dicks hang out. - March are you out of your mind talking to me here? - Why?

Mike I don't know any more today than I did yesterday, and you are gonna blow my damn cover if you keep this up. - This woman has killed two people in two days. - We don't know that. - Don't we Mr. Consolidated Life? What? what? The longer you stay on the job that big of the paycheck or is little mommy a good lay? Get your hands off me. Get them off now. Now. - Look, I do not work for you. Just stay away.

(door knocking) - Yes. - Did I wake you Angel? - No. - Can I come in for a second? - Okay. - What is it Angel? - What's what? - What's wrong? - Nothing. - You've barely spoken to me for days. You know you're number one on my personal chart, don't you? - I know. - Is it something I said? Is it something I did? Is it because I've been sleeping over? Don't you think I'd make a good daddy? Oh, Angel! (soft music) - I wanted to chase you away. - You wanted to chase me away, why on earth would you wanna chase me away? - Because, because, you would make a good daddy, but I don't want you to die. I'm having bad thoughts. - What bad thoughts angel? - That mommy killed Miss Jones, and Mrs. Withers. And maybe even Mr. Sterling and daddy for their money, and you have money too. (crying) - How grown up can you be Jessica Ann? - I don't know, real grown up I hope, if I have to. - Good. Because I wanna level with you about something. Something that may make you mad at me. - Why Mark? - You heard me talking downstairs, didn't you Jessica Ann? On the phone. You see, I haven't been completely honest with you, Jessica Ann, in fact, I've lied to you. - What? - My real name is Mark, but it's not Mark Jeffries I'm what they call an investigator. I work for an insurance company. That's the company that's looking into Mr. Sterling's death. - But you and Mommy. - That wasn't very nice, but it wasn't part of any plan. It just sort of happened. - Do you love her? - Well, your mommy's very beautiful woman and charming. - Do you love her? - No. Just again, what I did wasn't very nice, but I had to get close to your mommy. - You sure did. - I had to get the truth, Jessica Ann, I think your mommy is a murderer. But with your help-- - My help! - Actually your mommy is the one who needs the help. See if she's doing these things and we both think she is, then she's a sick person and she needs to be stopped, and she needs to be helped. - Helped. - If you could just think back and tell me some of the things you've seen, then we might be able to. - Close your eyes dear. (gun shots) (Jessica Ann screaming) (crying) Come on sweetie, come on sweetie. (crying) (soft music) - [Jessica Ann Voiceover] I couldn't remember ever seeing mommy cry before. She seemed to cry at daddy's funeral, and Mr. Sterling, but I'm pretty sure she's faking, not this time. I hope she wasn't sad because she's thinking of doing something bad to me too. - We have to call the police now dear. - Yes mommy. - And when they come, we have to stick together. Do you understand dear? - I'm not sure. - We have to tell them things that fit together. Like a puzzle fits together. Do you understand dear? - Yes mommy. (foreboding music) - Mark did bad things to mommy tonight. Bedroom things that I didn't want him to do. You do understand? - I think so. - And when mommy heard Mark in your bedroom, she was afraid he might be trying to do those same bad things to you. - But he didn't. - That doesn't matter, and you don't have to say he did either. - I'm glad mommy. - Because I don't want you to lie. And all those things Mark told you about being an investigator for an insurance company. Forget them. He never said those things. - Oh, okay mommy. - Because if you tell, it would get mommy in a lot of trouble, and we don't want that, do we? - No mommy. - Who's your best friend? - You are mommy. - Who loves you more than anything on God's green earth? - You do mommy. - Good girl. Here baby. (upbeat music) - Please help! Please hurry, we need an ambulance! (crying) I was molested, my daughter, I shot him. Yeah, I shot him, I shot him. (crying) (tense music) (call operator talking) - [Jessica Ann Voiceover] There were a lot of people in the house almost all night. - [Ambulance Attendant] Thank you honey. - [Ambulance Attendant] That's a nice little girl. - [Jessica Ann Voiceover] Mark looked like a ghost. (scary music) Lieutenant March said I couldn't use my bedroom tonight, and maybe not for a while after that. That was okay, I didn't wanna sleep in there anyway. - You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. - Nothing to tell, mommy thought Mark was going to do something bad to me, so she protected me. (soft music) - [Jessica Ann Voiceover] Lieutenant March talked to mommy for a long time. Most of the time, I couldn't hear what they were saying, but sometimes it was easy to hear. - Am I under arrest? - No, you are not under arrest. And yes, you should contact your lawyer. - More coffee lieutenant? - Yeah. Your sister is quite a woman. - You don't believe her, do you? - [Lieutenant March] Do you? - Of course I believe her she's my sister. - Yeah. And Jeffrey Dahmer was somebody's brother. - That was uncalled for. - [Lieutenant March] Is it? I suppose it is, it's been a long night. I'll talk to Jessica Ann in the morning. - Thank you for that much anyway. - [Lieutenant March] Maybe she should stay with you tonight. - That isn't my decision. - Maybe it should be. Thanks for the coffee. - You aren't really asleep are you? - No. - What you told me, is that what really happened Jessica Ann? - Mommy thought Mark was going to do something bad to me, so she protected me. - You love your mommy, don't you? - Yeah. - I love her too. - I know. - But you're afraid of her, aren't you? - Sure, every kid's afraid of their parents. - Beth! Maybe you better go now. - Maybe I should take Jessica Ann tonight. - I think you've done more than enough already Beth. - I can stay if you like. - We appreciate your concern, but we've been through a lot of tragedy together, Jessica Ann and I, and we will get through tonight, just fine. Won't we dear? - Yes mommy! (soft music) - You take the couch, I'll take the chair it'll be just like camping out. (soft music) (foreboding music) - [Jessica Ann Voiceover] The next afternoon, Lieutenant March and some other people questioned both me and mommy, together and separate. Sometimes mommy's lawyer, Mr. Ekhardt wouldn't let mommy answer a question. - So you didn't know the man you shared your bed with was investigating you? - Absolutely not. - Hasn't that been established Lieutenant? - I suppose so. But we've also established that the men she slept with had a bad habit of dying. - That's inappropriate Lieutenant. - Conveniently dying, that is. - Lieutenant! - How much money did you inherit when your first husband died Mrs. Sterling? - How much money did your wife inherit when her parents died? And where were you at the time? - [Jessica Ann Voiceover] I didn't lie, not exactly. Nobody asked if I knew Mark was an investigator. - Jessica Ann, did Mark Patterson or Jeffrey's as you knew him did he ever make an advance toward you of a a sexual nature? - You know, there really should be a representative from Child Welfare if you're gonna keep on-- - I am trying to confirm your client's story, Okay. Now I apologize for asking Jessica Ann but did he? - No, but mommy thought so. - Oh really? Why? - Because he was in my bedroom in his pajamas in the middle of the night. - I think that's quite enough. Good afternoon. - Do they have enough to hold me? - Not yet. - What do you mean not yet? - I don't think this thing is gonna lit up, from the looks of that lieutenant in there, This is only the start as (mumbles) - Well, thank you Neal, I'm sure that with you in our corner, everything will be just fine. - I gotta give you this, you know what you're doing. You take care of you. (ominous music) - We're going on vacation, dear. - Where mommy? - To a foreign land, it will be a surprise. - But I have school. - School will be out in a week or so, with your grades it won't matter. - [Jessica Ann Voiceover] The plaque was gone. Mommy was a lot of things, but she wasn't a fool. And it's probably in the river by now. But what about my friends - You'll make wonderful new friends. Here. Pack this suitcase with your own things. - What about my stuffed animals? - Pick your favorite, and Beth will send the rest along after we get where we're going. - Okay Mommy. - Jessica Ann. - Yes mommy. - Whose your best friend? - You are. - Who loves you more than anything-- - You do. (soft music) - [Jessica Ann Voiceover] I knew it wasn't a vacation, I knew we were moving. What could I do about it? Every kid knows that when your parents decide to move, the kid has no say in it, you just go where they go. (soft music) You have to go where I tell you Daddy. (upbeat music) We drove for a long time, a couple hours. Mommy looked different, was she frightened too? (upbeat music) - You about ready to stop for the night dear? - Oh could we mommy? Sleeping in the car makes my tummy hurt. - We'll pull into the next vacancy we see. (car engine roaring) (upbeat music) - [Jessica Ann Voiceover] We were on the outskirt of some town, with lots of factories and stuff. (upbeat music) (foreboding music) This wasn't like the fancy hotels we usually stayed in on vacation, I thought it was a little scary. (foreboding music) All I wanted was a nice soft bed. - Well, this isn't so bad, is it? - No mommy. - All right, get your jammies on. (upbeat music) How's my angel doing? - That's what Mark used to call me. - I miss him too. - Do you mommy? - I'm sorry, the accident happened. - [Jessica Ann Voiceover] Did Mommy really believe that? Could she make herself believe that lie? Or did you just wanna know if I believed it? Do you miss daddy? - I miss daddy most of all. You probably won't have any trouble sleeping tonight, will you? - No mommy, I'm really tired. - Do you know how proud I am of you? For being such a good student. Such a good girl. Say your prayers dear. - Yes mommy. (soft music) Good night daddy. (yawning) (foreboding music) - She is a sick person, and she has to be stopped, and she has to be helped. (foreboding music) - Sometimes mommies have to make hard decisions. (foreboding music) If they take mommy away, who would look after you? - [Jessica Ann Voiceover] Mommy was telling me these things only because she didn't think I could hear them. (foreboding music) (screaming) - Mommy! - Jessica Ann! Jessica Ann! - No mommy. (crying) - Jessica Ann, open the door. - No! - You just had a bad dream dear, a nightmare.
