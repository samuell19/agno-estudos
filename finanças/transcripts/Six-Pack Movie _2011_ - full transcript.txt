Kinotar presents This is a crosswalk, see? People walking. What? What? What? Honk more so I can hear you. What? Boys, I have a job for you. I have a moving company and there's a job tomorrow. A big one. All my guys are on holiday and I need a few strong men. I thought you meant something with a getaway car. But you don't look too strong. We're not too strong. - Enjoying a carefree youth. You don't look too young either. - In fact, we're not. We kind of extended our youth. - You can do that until you're 30. Then you're officially a bum. Extend your willy for all I care, but how about the job? I pay 50 per ugly face for a quick job, no tax. Not today. - It's tomorrow. Not today. We can't tomorrow. - Not this summer. Sorry. Lazy punks, dammit. It makes me sick to see such pieces of shit. Sorry. - Yeah, really sorry. Get a job, damn hippies. Or take this one, I mean. SIX- PACK MOVIE To be polite, what's this so-called smell? I don't know. - Somebody must be on a haddock diet. A sick stench. - Hello, mate. Have you got ice? - No. Mr. Homeless in the stairway was out of it. -'Hello, mate." That's all he ever says. I guess he likes this stairway. Aren't there nicer ones around? A neighbor, or you know Gabriella, said he used to live here. He doesn't bother me. - No bother, no. Henninen disappeared last night from the kebab shop. The question is where? I waited for ten minutes and went to poke around the bushes. Then you emerged suddenly... and mumbled let's get the fuck out of here. You're having a calzone then. I had an encounter of sorts... and I decided to take a walk. Then I saw a woman sitting on the steps. Or she was just a girl, unbearably beautiful. She was wearing a tight white shirt. I asked her would it be bad if I talked to her. She said no. And now you feel bad. - Damn right. She looked so sad... that I thought I could cheer her up a little. I saw a surveillance camera across the street... and remembered the time I peed outside a police station... and got a lesson in manners. There I was, telling her the shameful story. She wasn't too thrilled and said she'd go home. I asked why. She didn't know. She just had to go. She said: "Bye and nice talking to you. Sort of. And in she went with her tight top and young breasts. That's when it hit me. It? That I'm inevitably way past such tight tops... and round firm boobs and pretty young girls. I felt really fucking old. That's hangover talking. There's someone at the door. Oh my god... Oh shit! Are you hurt? I don't understand. I brought it out here... and it was nowhere near the edge. I'm sure it was closer to the wall than the edge. Call an ambulance. Now! Too bad for a good washing machine. Too bad for a good old lady. She's not gone, is she? But her pamphlets went all over the place. I wonder about the chain of events. Stop! So what? What were they doing there and where's Gabriella? What if she's dead? - Dead? Death is just what I need! She has a plantation in her closet and I have her key. The key links me to the plants if something happened to her. What? That makes no sense. Goddammit, Pasty, knock it off! Goddammit, let's play. - I'm just worried. There can't be any criminal repercussions... for having a neighbor's key. Perhaps I should just go to sleep. No, I have to get rid of the key. She licked me. Hello. We already met, with her. In the stairway, with the washing machine incident I just wanted to make sure everything's okay here. I'm from downstairs. I live downstairs. Her mother is dead. Fucking goddam hell. I mean I'm sorry. The police took them. A terrible way to go, dammit. Hits the corner of a dresser. She tried to call for help, but nobody hears. Nobody cares. Imagine, she lay there for three weeks. It's a fucking mess... when a decaying body lies there like that. The fluids ruin the floor. The whole floor must be rebuilt. The cat had gnawed her from here. The goddam cat! That's a natural explanation to the stench. With all due respect. How about the plants? - The cops took them. An added burden on the family. - Yeah, the daughter was there. She was all derailed. My hangover is back. I feel so sick I'm gonna be sick. Could we just go somewhere? I need an airing. I need to take a nap. - Of course. I could take a nap if you two left. Let's go! - I slept... I didn't sleep well. There's one thing you could do. - Sounds ominous. I'm not into "things" right now. Could you take the key upstairs? I can't go back. I really fucked up there... and like you probably gathered, I don't... - Give it to me. Let's go, Henninen. Now. Hello. Hello, hello! Is it Marshall? - Yeah. HI'.- Hi We took the key. There were loads of empty bottles there. We got generous and offered to take the shells away. Where? - Ta the stare, dammit. Four plastic bags each. Or I had five. We got money far them. Came here. - Not yet. Remind him about the dice. - I remind you about the dice. Let's confess right away, so nobody needs to feel bad. We managed to fuck up too. Or Pasty did. We packed the empty bottles and he bid farewell by... The empty bottles gave me fresh energy... so I wanted to say something encouraging to them. Before I realized it, I said: "Enjoy!" Tell me you didn't, did you? - It was gargantually embarrassing. The woman said we're "sordid lads". - No wonder. If the term makes you feel like an outsider... I'd say you fall into that category too. Who says "lad" any more? Aren't lads as distinct... as farmhands, Washerwomen and gamekeepers? I need something for this apocalyptic shame. Bring me one too. - Give me money. Don't I get a share of Gabriella's bottles? She is, or was, my neighbor. I see. Let's see how far these resources go. Hello? I'll call. you back. That made me feel good. The world is not all rotten. Let's take it as a good sign. From now on, this is a good day. Because I say so. All this reminded me of another neighbor issue. A filthy young couple just moved in. Really filthy. They copulate all day by the open window. I guess they get a kick out of teasing me. Or at least the woman does. The girl, or tramp. She leans against the window and her breasts swing. The guy looks down to where it all happens... but the broad looks right at my window, me in the eye. Must you sit by the window? I never thought of it that way. I like to sit there. And they just moved in. I was there first. That's pretty obvious despite your UV shades. You don't know what I'm looking at. She doesn't know what I'm looking at. Nobody knows what I'm looking at. The hunk will soon cause you serious bodily harm. I don't feel like taking you to first aid now. Know what I'm really craving for right now? What? - Love. Oh brother, love is so hard to reach. It just occurred to me... that love is very hard to eat. The guy who invented that committed suicide. - What? Suicide. Invented what? The sugar wrap, for god's sake! Are you awake? The clue is to twist it open like this. He killed himself because nobody uses his invention. Everyone just tears it open like before. Give me two cigarettes. Why two? - I need them. I see. Here. Am I the freaking Salvation Army now? Should we throw dice? - Too tired. I'm really keen on the idea of throwing dice. The mere thought of it made me feel better. We only have four. It must be at home, the fifth one. Let's go and get it. It's there all alone. A grown man steals goddam toys! I know you know him. You hang out here every day! If your hands are well enough to steal someone's bread... why not do something useful with them! Goddam fucking vagina! Yeah, we totally agree. And we don't know him. And if we ever see him, we'll tell him... it was really wrong what he did, whatever it was. Absolutely wrong. And you, dammit! Wanker! It would not have cost much. Hi. She reminded me of holidays at my grandmother's. Hello and thank you. We got the cursing and fire and sparks for your stunt. Sorry, but I got us dices. - What's this? I guess he jumped. Jumped, my ass. He was pushed. They've been drinking and fighting up there all day. This was bound to happen. - A nice landing, asshole. There'll be more falls unless they drag that carcass out of here. This is almost like a mass staring competition. Hey, was he okay? In one piece and breathing. - Way to go, Arto! Arto is king! - Arto is amazing. We know a legend. Bummer. I'm just wondering if it's dog poop... or honest human shit. - Fuck. I think I met my winner. Way too big a pile for me. These are my only shoes! I beg to say that... Excuse me. - Yeah? Since we're being so fucking polite, I beg to say... as I said before that these are my only shoes! I can't help the fucking smell. I'm fucking sorry! What if I organize you a new pair of shoes? You're the thief in this family. Where's the nearest footwear store? Marshall? - What? No, don't look at me. I blush and get sweaty even when buying milk. Goddam slob! You'd need a good spanking. Oh shit. But I won't do anything, and I don't know you. - Fine. But we can't bring Mr. Problem along. A shoeless man might attract attention in a shoe store. Good grief! Young ones. Go on, you two. Someone has to stay here to monitor law and order. I don't feel like a gangster planning a major shoe robbery. Stay strong, man. This is a simple task. A man needs shoes and shoes he shall have. But nothing expensive. Let's take a pair nobody would buy. - Ugly ones? Ugly as hell. Let's synch our watches. I'll look at books. You needed books... I mean shoes. Yeah. I'm just looking at these books here. What? What? Sorry, nobody asked anything. - Yeah... I was just wondering about your business idea. What do shoes and books have in common? Do you have plenty of literature on shoes here... or shoes with which... Well, I don't know. Both have incredibly short lifespans these days. I used to sell more shoes and there were some readers. College boys, philosophy. Then came the fetishists. All of a sudden I was selling high heels, rubber boots... and slippers and threw a magazine into the bargain. They have all disappeared into electronic internet now. I couldn't find anything good. My feet are so flat... it's hard to find shoes that would fit. They all hurt. Flat feet. Right. This is a challenge. Take off the sandals, young man. Let's have a look. Size 41? - Yeah. Alright! I'll make the introductions: Anna, Veera, Laura. I'm Marshall. - Pasty. She's the one I told you about. - What did you tell? Nothing. just that I talked to someone. My life is pretty uneventful. - That's about to change. Here. Bloody hell! Bloody hell! There's no shit on them. Fuck, these are far too small. Hurts like hell. I forgot all about size. I tried them on my feet. Marshall's the one who's my size. - Be happy you have shoes! I'm surrounded by idiots. The alcoholic looks like a scarecrow. Have you seen a scarecrow? Or should I say scary crow? - Oh god. Scary Tinman? It's French and means a scary Tintin. Scary Tintin. No, no. Listen. A scarecrow is a self-made pile of junk... whereas a scarycrow sounds like a serious product. Perhaps a mass product you can buy in a store. Have you really seen one? - I can't believe this. My grandpa made a scarecrow out of hay and old clothes. But they also hung strips of foil on it. The foil scared the crows more than the doll. But to me the doll was scarier. Henninen's cousin's cottage... - By a lake. They protect the garden with old CD's. Take That. I once peed on an electric fence. - And your life is uneventful? Are you from the country? - No. Okay. My grandma is. - I have a grandma too. But she's not from the country, I'm afraid. Do you live around here? Me and Pasty do, Henninen just hangs out. - What? What do you do? - Nothing much, really. Sounds cool. - No, this is not cool. Oh shit. - Piggies. Hello. - Hello. Our rules say we must say hello before we beat you up. Hello. Let's see some ID, girls. Do you mean these girls or girls in general? Give us the alcohol. From the bag too. Is that fair? - Shall we take yours too? How aggressive. - Don't. What did you say? Nothing, I guess. That's it then. Have a good day. Give me the opened one too. Bloody show-offs! - Fucking nazis. Pigs are cops. - Fucking clowns. Don't! - Don't what? No, no. Stop! It was humor! It was good humor. Honestly. Pull up your pants. They hate it. It's like a sore spot. Does he do that often? He's not really ass-oriented... but he has a problem with authority. He snaps and starts mooning. Should we go find Henninen? We have no idea where they took him. Where did your friends go? Should we hunt them down? Search for them? Let's just wait here. Yeah, I don't really know what to say. About anything. Have I told you my beer-in-a-bag story? The beer and the plastic bag made me think of it. I was there. - Laura wasn't. I don't think she wants to hear it. It's a relevant story. - Go on. Weren't you gonna look for your friends? I don't mean you have to go. I think you're really nice. Or pleasant. I'm just sick of listening to Pasty. We were in a bar once... and ordered lots of pints and a plastic bag before it closed. We poured the beers into the plastic bag... and left, drinking beer from the plastic bag on the street. Or from a hole we made into the bag. Rig ht. I think I'd better find them. Morons. Did she leave because of the story? - Yes. How long did I sleep? - I didn't clock it. What's the big deal about how long you sleep? I was just wondering if it's evening yet. Well... it could be early evening. Or late afternoon... or mid-evening, even nightfall. I had the weirdest dream, but realized I can't explain it... although here I am, explaining it, but I won't say more. You were beaten by the police. - It was no premonition. How the hell are you back? They drove to a gas station and told me to sit down... and think long and hard what I should do with my ass. They said they don't want to spoil the already bad work atmosphere... with anal smells... and told me not to show myself around town again today. Then they took off and I bought this. And walked back here. Where did you get money? - He's sharp, even half-asleep. Change from the store. - It's my money. And you bought expensive beer with it. Imported beer! He should never get any pocket money. Needs to show off right away. - Nonsense. But I have a question for you: What the fuck next? Nothing. I mean, all's well that ends well. Why do I feel you've been saying that all summer? Right back at you. - Because we're friends. And there's plenty of drink here. - Give me one. Should we make a move? To throw dice, I mean. Let's go on a tram ride. Downtown. To throw dice. - I just woke up. Yeah, let's go downtown to run some errands. I haven't left this village for at least a week. Let's be brave and open-minded for once. Ticket, please. Excuse me, monsieur. Would you be interested in a surprise? For just a tenner you can get this surprise bag. Its contents are guaranteed to thrill you. You lost me. Who are you? I have many names, but you can call me Surprise Bag Man. Isn't it heavy? Touch it. I'm sure you want to know what's in it. I know I do. - No. I've had a terrible day. Please understand. - Six euros. Five euros. - No! You don't have to be so rude. We're just having a civilized conversation. What's so fucking unnatural about that? - Sorry. Did you get a fine? - Yes. Can we get the fuck out of here? A fine is not the end of the world. Look! A sweaty tourist. - Let's go. I think I've had it. I've had it with this field trip. - What? A fine is not the end of the world. It fucking is! This is not my thing. What's his problem? You're the one who wanted to do this. I lost interest. - Fuck! I'm the one who got fined twice. Me, me, me! All the same for me. To me. I really didn't need this... I didn't need this. - What? The negativity. Always an uphill struggle. My thoughts exactly. This can't be over yet. I don't want to end this day in a stupid half-stupor. It looks more than a half-stupor. If someone had thought of the price-stupor correlation... we might have some money left... but I guess this is pretty much it for now. Stupid old hag! Did that help? - In fact, yes. We could borrow money. - I'm really tired. It didn't help at all. Houseman lives in that alley. He has a job. Construction, cleaning or chimney sweeping. I don't know, but last time I saw him he was on holiday. No good then. - What? It doesn't mean he's doomed. He must get vacation money. He must have a job if he takes vacations. See it? Not exactly, but it must be this one. Right, an address is mostly a matter of opinion. I just realized I don't know Houseman's last name. You don't know Houseman's last name? Is Houseman his first name? Is he Houseman Cooper? No, I thought it was like a definer. Meaning that he likes to stay at home. He must hang out somewhere, because we never see him. See him where? There's a Hussman and a Mouse. - What a name! I don't see Hussman, but a Houseman I see. Fucking moron. Houseman! It's Pasty. Open the door. I hope the cat didn't eat him. Can we come in? - Sure. A friend of mine painted it. It's called "Houseman". It's a portrait of me. - Right. So you're Houseman. What's the cat's name? Bruce. - How do you pronounce it? Like Bruce. Bruce with a c? - Yes. A funny name. Why not Ian? Ian is a dog's name. We wanted to, like... How should I put it? How much? - Fucking enough! We've had a bad day. - As in...? We've tried to throw dice. It's hard, throwing dice. You don't need that now. That's why I'm smoking it. - Oh, the decadence. 20. - It's not fucking enough even for personal hygiene. I think Henninen is trying to say... that we'd be interested in a slightly bigger loan. If at all possible. Only if I get it back too. - Of course! Who do you think we are? - You know us. I'm afraid I do. I think we'd better go. So much for the courtesy call, right? Seems like a lost cause. - This happens all the time. I'm sorry. Henninen, hey. Let me live my own life! Let me live! Should we take him somewhere, if he won't sober up? Like home? Home, nursing home, foster home... I don't know. Nobody is going anywhere, dammit. We're two and one third alive now. You're showing delightful signs of life... although I don't think you're quite whole yet. Objects are inclined to fall. I see. We could say objects have a fixation on falling. Is it possible... you're just sorry about breaking the urn? Who the fuck cares? Is it okay to break people's urns? - Same difference. You're really pissing me off now. I know. - Know what? I know. Henninen! Henninen? - Yeah? What the fuck! The car... This is the best fun ever! Why did you start running? - I don't know. I thought you said you knew. - I don't know! What is it you don't know? I don't know what I don't know... and I don't know why I started running. This sounds ridiculous, like couples therapy. What's wrong? - "Aggle". Nothing, but I just feel goddam weird. Kind of great. - Yesh. What's yesh? - What's "aggle"? This beer tastes just great. In capital letters GREAT. That sounds kind of better. I don't know if I'm up for a game. - You're wrong. The moment has finally come when you, in particular... It's them. - Evening! Who are they? - We saw them in the park. Oh, I see. - Sit down. I think we'll move on. - This is good for rainspotting. If I may talk about the weather. - Can't we stay? We have better things to do. Plenty of tension in the air. Did you see that? Was Esa hit? What the fuck is his problem? Does anyone else need more beer? Ones with money, I mean. - I'll get for us. That settles it then. What's up, boys? So, how was your day? - Like shit. Full of shit. - Need to pee on it? He's Erno. - Hi, Erno. Hi. - Hi, Erno. I won't shake your hand. You young ones have such odd hand-shaking manners. I feel old and incompetent. - I see. No of fence, Erno. Wanna throw dice? - How do you throw dice? Is it a game or do you just throw it around? We've really tried to throw it today. Usually we play Yatzy. It's kind of like the music, but spelled differently. Why do I sound so fucking old when I open my blessed mouth? "My blessed mouth." Who the fuck talks like that? We have three versions. Basic Yatzy we play when we won't play long. Then there's Slave Yatzy and Nazi Yatzy... when the stakes are really high. What's the clue? In what? - In the Nazi version. Why do you ask? Fucking bullshit about a game. Stupid hillbilly games. Sorry, but I don't understand. - Understand what? I didn't get "hillbilly" either. Just hillbilly. I don't need to explain every word. It just sounded like country jargon. But you lived in the country. - It was her, or her grandma. Morons! Asking about a word. It's like asking what "juice" means. I called them morons too. You didn't realize we are morons. I'm still manhandling the juice - Manhandling? It should bring to mind something noble... or something special like a nectar of the gods... or something pure and holy. - But it doesn't. It bloody well doesn't. I'd say "juice" is the most dismal word I know. Juice. - Yeah, it sounds a bit bitter. It reeks of disappointment and conspiracy. It implies some orgastic feast... but you end up getting some watered-down liquid... at a ski competition... to flush down the burnt sausage and icy mustard. Sounds like someone had a sad childhood. Juices are devilish. Jesus I'm drunk. Henninen and I went to a cottage last summer. His cousin had pure alcohol... because his dad is a doctor or something important. Important people tend to have pure alcohol. Anyhow, there we were, the five of us. I don't mean us five. Well, we're not five, but we were then. Me, Henninen, his cousin, ... a guy from the suburbs and Silly Pete, ... a village idiot with a bad speech defect. The guy from the suburb had a fancy red motorboat. Silver. No, red. Which Pasty decided to take out in the early morning. He crashed it so loudly... that everyone on the lake thought somebody drowned. Before passing out... he had enough sense of drama to call for help... and rescuers rushed to the scene from two counties. We can't serve tap beer for a while. We were so sound asleep and drunk... that the rescue party couldn't get us awake. Finally they had found our personal papers... and based on Pasty's list of participants concluded... that Silly Pete was missing. When Silly Pete woke up... he was so drunk he couldn't talk straight. He had the speech defect. They thought that someone called Silly Pete had drowned. Anyway, a local busybody cycled to the scene... and made her own conclusions, ... telling everyone the sad news that Silly Pete had drowned. Silly. When Pasty was brought into the cottage... and he said everyone was alive and kicking, ... it was time to wonder who had fucked up. We all agreed it was a proper fuck-up. But it ended well, at least for Silly Pete. He crawled back home when he regained his strength. They were thrilled to pieces, of course. His relatives hugged him and neighbors said: "Great to see you alive." He had been a loner in the village before that. What a sad story. He had to die once before they noticed him. What was your name again? Sorry, I forgot. - Paddy. I'll get more beer. Will you come to my graduation party? - What? Help. - Poing. Don't touch me, impotent. - Listen. Stop it! He hit her. - Shit! I mean yes. Fucking asshole! What are you doing? I think I've seen them before. Let go! Leave me alone! Get a life! I don't fucking believe it. - I think that... bye! Goddammit! Didn't we warn you? Yeah, but the guy hit the lady... I mean woman. He's never hit me. This little chocolate bar wouldn't even know how. These lads again... Why are you all over town? Leave others alone. What have I done? Am I a crime against humanity? Do you know how hurtful that is? What's wrong with you? Why aren't you doing your job? This woman was assaulted. What's with all the questions? I recommend you shut up. I agree, in fact. Let's all just calm down and pull our hand brakes. Cut the fucking bullshit! You're awfully close... Did you miss my ass? A cab! What...? Okay. Put the pasty in your pocket. - I got it. I still need to get to the hospital. Goddammit, it's like on another planet. It's really far to walk. It would be a real safari for your broken paws. You can't say that. I know what I can and cannot say. Let me talk my talk and shut up for a change. Right! My toes are fucking toast. I can't just go home to sleep. Now that you mentioned it... They can't fix your toes there. Think they'd put them in cast? I don't care what they do, I want my foot fixed. You just want to be in a hospital. - Yeah, right. Perhaps I'll get some compassion there. I get it. If you can't get love, a hospital will do. This day was shot from the get-go. I mean all this shit. This is definitely the work of some sinister shitmaker. Imagine this totally unmasculine injury I have. How can such a stupid injury hurt so much? Even cab drivers and young ones laugh at us. We're total losers. Get up, will you? Before you get ass cancer. You wanted to get to the hospital. Yeah, I did. I was once on my way back from someplace. - Really? I mean I was crossing this same bridge... and a guy was leaning against the railing here. I walked past him and suddenly I was sure he'd jump. A premonition. I got terribly worried about him and had to turn back... to make sure he had no such plans. He turned to me and gave me the broadest smile... and said he would never ever, his exact words, ... that he would never jump. He said he was just looking at his beautiful city. I stood there, embarrassed... and when I finally got ready to go... he got all important and said he was a poet. Blimey. What did you do? I went home to bed. Were we at the hospital? - How come? My foot feels much better all of a sudden. Listen, friends... I know exactly what you mean. We feel the same. All kinds of thoughts just came to mind. Marshall, I already told you we know. Come look at this! What? Nothing. I just felt kind of lonely. Subtitles: Jaana Wiik
