הרפתקה בשחקים Harpatka BaShchakim SKY RAIDERS - Adventure in the sky ﻿Good morning! ﻿I ironed your shirt so you'll be handsome. ﻿Haven't you started unpacking? ﻿Later. ﻿Get up, kiddo, come on. ﻿Yotami, ﻿you're gonna make loads of new friends today. You'll see. ﻿And please don't forget your inhaler. ﻿I won't forget it. ﻿...divided by 1 equals 14. ﻿Divided by 9... ﻿Can't you show up on time? ﻿I couldn't find the classroom. ﻿You're the new kid? Welcome. ﻿Come in, introduce yourself. ﻿Hi. I'm Yotam. ﻿Nice shirt. -Thanks. ﻿Did you run away from your Bar-Mitzvah? ﻿Tomer, that's enough. ﻿Yotam, there's a seat ﻿back there, okay? ﻿What a perfect selfie. -Yeah, it's awesome. ﻿Gimme the ball! ﻿Noa, you coming? -In a sec. ﻿Yaniv, I'm in the clear! Are you blind?! ﻿My leg! ﻿Who wants to sub? ﻿Me! ﻿What's wrong with him? ﻿Get a teacher! ﻿Get a teacher! ﻿I'll take him home to rest. ﻿Okay, thank you. ﻿Feel better, Yotam. ﻿Show's over, ﻿back to class. ﻿Your teacher called me in a state of hysteria. ﻿I almost got into an accident. ﻿You can't participate in vigorous physical activity ﻿and forgetting your inhaler is so irresponsible. ﻿Yotami, I get it. ﻿You see everyone playing and you want to join in. ﻿But we have to work as a team. ﻿I can't drop everything ﻿at the office and run to school ﻿just because you can't accept your limitations. ﻿You know how much you mean to me, don't you? ﻿I gotta take this call. ﻿Hello? ﻿Hey! ﻿Hey, are you okay? -Yeah, it's nothing. ﻿Aren't you the kid ﻿who almost died playing soccer today? ﻿It was just an asthma attack. ﻿A mild one. ﻿That's the Black Spit! What is it doing here?! ﻿I dunno, they just told me to wash it. ﻿Are you kidding me? ﻿You really don't know this plane? ﻿It's super famous, ﻿a rare Spitfire, over 70 years old, ﻿from World War II. ﻿Do you have any idea what you're washing?! ﻿It's a legend! ﻿Okay, chill. ﻿How come you know so much about it? ﻿My dad's a pilot. He taught me about the history. ﻿Cool! ﻿I wonder what kind of engine it has... ﻿Um... ﻿A piston-powered engine. ﻿I thought it's a Rolls-Royce Merlin, ﻿1,700 horsepower. ﻿Nice talking to you. ﻿C'mon, don't be so sensitive. ﻿I'll give you a tour. ﻿We're installing a second seat for a co-pilot. ﻿It's not like a Toyota that you can get spare parts. ﻿Everything has to be repaired by hand. ﻿Look, this is a riveter. ﻿What's your name? -Noa. ﻿I'm Yotam. ﻿We just moved to Beer-Sheva. ﻿See? ﻿You don't assemble the panels with screws. ﻿You need special rivets. ﻿Hey. ﻿I can't believe it, what did you do to my plane?! ﻿It's not yours, it's the museum's. ﻿Are you out of your mind? ﻿Wait till Dad hears about this. ﻿-Ofer, please don't be an asshole... -It's my fault, I was-- ﻿Who's the midget? ﻿I didn't know you opened a kindergarten. ﻿I'm just saying, it was my idea-- ﻿Noa's job is to wash the plane. ﻿Not break it. ﻿Don't mind my jerk brother. Let's go. ﻿Jerk? ﻿Nono, are you okay? ﻿What is this mess? ﻿Look what she did. -I didn't mean it, Dad. ﻿He asked me to show him-- ﻿Sweetie, you know you're not allowed to touch the tools. ﻿And without safety goggles? You could've hurt yourself. ﻿Do you have any idea how much it'll cost to fix this? ﻿Okay. ﻿Go home, ﻿take a timeout from helping with the plane. ﻿What? No way. -Noa, please. ﻿But Dad... -Did you hear me? ﻿Are you okay? ﻿Sorry if got you into trouble. ﻿It's not your fault. ﻿Are you free tomorrow? ﻿I could use a tour around town. ﻿If you feel like it. ﻿If not... -I have dance class after school. ﻿Cool, don't worry about it. ﻿But we can hang out afterwards. ﻿There's a cool place I want to show you. ﻿Can we meet at four by the school gate? ﻿Great. See you tomorrow. ﻿Noa. -Mom! ﻿Is she cute? ﻿Mom, it's not like that. She's just being friendly. ﻿I met here at the nearby airfield. ﻿Her dad is fixing up the Black Spit, it's an amazing warbird-- ﻿Where did you hang out? An airport? ﻿It's not an airport, it's more like... ﻿a little airfield. ﻿It's part of the Air Force Museum. ﻿Of all places, we had to move near an airfield. ﻿Why are you overreacting? ’-I'm not overreacting. ﻿It's dangerous with all the airplanes, I don't want you hanging out there. ﻿It's not dangerous, it's fun. It reminds me of home. ﻿Yota mi, we moved here to forget life on the air base, ﻿to start something new. ﻿But I don't want to forget, ﻿I liked it a million times more than this stinking town. ﻿Why are you so difficult? -Why?! ﻿Because you decided to move without even asking me! ﻿So if I'm stuck here without all my friends, ﻿I'll go wherever I want, whenever I want! ﻿No, Yotam, the airfield is off limits. ﻿Is that clear? ﻿Hi, is that clear?! Yes. ﻿Hi. ﻿Hi. ﻿Hi. -Let's go. ﻿Hi. ﻿I wasn't sure I was at the right place. ﻿Why? How many schools are there? ﻿Let's go. ﻿I wasn't sure I was... ﻿at the right gate. ﻿I wasn't sure I was at the right gate. ﻿So where are we going? -Surprise. ﻿How come your dad is the one restoring the Black Spit? ﻿He volunteered to repair it. ﻿He and my brother are flying it ﻿at the Independence Day air show. -No kidding? ﻿It's all Ofer ever talks about. ﻿Ever been to the air show? ﻿Yeah, when I was little, my dad took me every year ﻿but I haven't gone in the past few years. ﻿Too bad you stopped going. It's the coolest thing ever. ﻿Come on, I'll race you. ﻿First one to the grove, wins. ﻿I'm beating you. ﻿Yotam! ﻿It's Mad Morris! ﻿Go! ﻿Who is that old guy? ﻿Mad Morris. He's so weird. ﻿He hates kids. -Really? ﻿He used to have a family, but they all disappeared ﻿and no one knows where to. ﻿I heard he buried them in his backyard. ﻿We're lucky he didn't catch us. ﻿Easy, we don't want you to overdose. ﻿Where are we? ﻿It's the place I wanted to show you. ﻿Airplane Cemetery. ﻿Come on. ﻿Noa? ﻿Come on! ﻿Where did you go? ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Look what I found. ﻿I wonder what plane it is. ﻿It's the crappiest piece of junk I've ever seen. ﻿Let's split before you catch a tetanus. ﻿"Adventure in the Squadron" ﻿Mom, I'm home. ﻿You okay? ﻿If I won't unpack your stuff, it'll never happen? ﻿Mind taking the empty boxes to the recycling? ﻿You were a warbird. ﻿A warbird? ﻿This piece of junk? ﻿Why not? ﻿Is there a loose screw"1 in your head?> ﻿It was a crop duster, tops. ﻿Fought some beetles. ﻿Oh, really? ﻿If it was a crop duster, ﻿why the machine guns? ﻿To spray the beetles with bullets? ﻿What is that? -Messerschmitt. ﻿The first fighter plane of the Israeli Air Force. ﻿From the War of Independence. ﻿Squadron 101. ﻿The First Fighter Squadron! ﻿No way! Do you have any idea how rare this is? We have to tell... ﻿everybody! ﻿What are you doing?! ﻿What's your problem? -What's wrong with you? ﻿What'll you think will happen if everyone knows? ﻿They'll take it away from us! ﻿It's our plane. We keep it a secret, Noa. ﻿Well clean it up, fix it, paint it... ﻿And display it at the air show! ﻿With all the historic warbirds. ﻿You're a genius! My brother will die of envy. ﻿No Spitfire can beat the Messerschmitt. ﻿Hold on tight. ﻿We're taking her around, lower the flaps! ﻿That's the elevator trim, not the flaps. ﻿I thought your dad's a pilot. Didn't he teach you anything? ﻿He taught me a little bit. I was small. ﻿Where is he now? ﻿He's dead. ﻿What? ﻿Really? ﻿I don't know what to say, ﻿like... ﻿I never met anyone whose dad died. ﻿It's okay. It happened a long time ago. ﻿I'm fine. -When did it happen? ﻿More than 3 years ago. ﻿How did it happen? -Accident. ﻿His plane crashed. ﻿Wow. ﻿It doesn't matter now. ﻿What do you call it? Elevator flap? ﻿Elevator trim. -Awesome. ﻿Do you want to be a pilot, too? ﻿Even if I wanted to, it'll never happen. ﻿I have asthma and I always get attacks at the worst of times. ﻿Also, my mother would never let me. ﻿She hates everything about planes. ﻿I have an idea. ﻿Do you feel like flying an airplane? ﻿Right now? ﻿No, it's a bad idea. ﻿I don't want to crash it. ﻿You won't, I'm right here next to you. ﻿Here, this is the throttle. ﻿Push it. ﻿Wait until it gathers speed... ﻿Awesome! ﻿Use the rudder and the ailerons together. ﻿Like this? ﻿Perfect. ﻿You're really good at this. ﻿Wow. ﻿Did you see the loop? -You sure it's your first time? ﻿You're not pulling my leg? ﻿No! ﻿You're really good. Who taught you? ﻿You're a genius, bro. ﻿What's going on? ﻿Yotam, what are you doing?! -I don't know, it's not responding! ﻿Oh my god! ﻿It's not working! ﻿Give it to me. -Take it. ﻿That's enough, bro. -What? ﻿You're being too cruel to your little sister. ﻿I want too! ﻿No, no... ﻿It should be around here somewhere. Where's the plane? ﻿Are you looking for this? ﻿Come here. ﻿Aren't you the brat who dented my truck? ﻿Come with me. ﻿What's your name? Yotam. ﻿Yotam what? -Yotam Peleg. ﻿Where do you live? ﻿12 Clover Street. ﻿Here. ﻿Am I digging my own grave? ﻿That's not a bad idea. ﻿But first you'll have to compensate me for all the damages you did. ﻿Let's start with you clearing out all the dry weeds. ﻿If you're thinking about running away, ﻿think again. ﻿Because I'll find you, ﻿Yotam Peleg from 12 Clover Street. ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿I'm rescuing you. Let's go ﻿before he buries us here. ﻿If I don't clear away the weeds, ﻿then Morris will bury me for real. ﻿I can't run away, ﻿he knows my address. ﻿Is there another shovel? ﻿I love this song! ﻿What do you say? ﻿Let's dance on top of the world ﻿And turn everyone around ﻿What do you say? ﻿Looks like it feels good to you ﻿Like a dream that comes and goes... ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Mr. Morris? Hello? ﻿Yotam, let's just go. ﻿But he has your plane. ﻿It's not worth it. The plane is done for. ﻿I'm not leaving your plane here. -Yotam! ﻿Are you crazy? ﻿Look! ﻿Like new! ﻿What are you doing in here? ﻿There was no answer, so... ﻿So you waltzed right in. ﻿Get out! ﻿Thank you for fixing the plane. ﻿You're welcome. Now take it and leave. ﻿Before I change my mind. ﻿Check it out! ﻿Just like ours. ﻿Was I not clear? ﻿We know that plane. -No, you don't. ﻿Nowadays kids don't know anything. ﻿It's a Messerschmitt, from World War II. ﻿Great, so you know the name of the plane. ﻿You deserve a medal. Now get out! ﻿You have a miniature one ﻿but we have a real one. ﻿Shut up... ﻿What is this nonsense? ﻿You're right, total nonsense... ﻿Thanks for your hospitality... ﻿We found it deserted in a junkyard, and now it's ours. ﻿So don't say it's nonsense, okay? ﻿You better let us go, ﻿before I start screaming. ﻿No problem, young lady. ﻿Let's go. -Where to? ﻿You're showing me that plane of yours ﻿or your parents will have to pay for the dent in my truck ﻿and the broken window. Got it? ﻿We're fixing it for the air show. ﻿But it's a secret. Swear you won't tell anyone. ﻿Fixing it? ﻿Nonsense... ﻿Our country's history rotting in the mud... ﻿Such a shame. ﻿It used to be a Messerschmitt, ﻿now it's nothing but a pile of rust. ﻿But we can fix it. ﻿Just like you fixed the model plane. ﻿You're comparing a toy model to a fighter plane? ﻿You kids have no idea what you're talking about. ﻿This isn't a plane, it's a corpse. ﻿Such a waste of time. ﻿Are you coming? ﻿Therefore X must be equal to... ﻿Yotam? ﻿Earth to Yotam? ﻿The asthma suffocated his brain, too. ﻿Quiet! ﻿Yotam, you'll have to work harder if you want to pass the test. ﻿Anyone else? Yes. ﻿Are you sure it's worth it? ﻿Morris said the plane is done for. ﻿A pile of rust. ﻿So Morris said. ﻿It's our plane ﻿and no one will tell us... ﻿Where's the plane? ﻿He stole it. ﻿Remember he said how rare Messerschmitts are? ﻿I bet he sold it to a museum for a million dollars. ﻿How dare you steal our plane? ﻿You think I care about this junker? ﻿But if you decided to paint it, you'd better do it right. ﻿Can we fix the plane here? ﻿You can't fix this junker. ﻿Best you can do is clean it up a little. ﻿At least it won't rust outside anymore. ﻿This packinghouse has been empty for ages. ﻿At least someone will use it now. ﻿Thanks for helping us. ﻿I'm not helping you. ﻿I already spent too much time on this. ﻿Look, he attached the wings. ﻿It's stuck. It used to move freely. ﻿What are you doing?! ﻿I leave you alone for two seconds and you're already breaking it? ﻿It's a delicate mechanism. ﻿Did you hear that sound? ﻿You're making it cry! ﻿Poor thing. ﻿We should give it a kiss. ﻿Little brat. ﻿Do you... ﻿know how to fix planes? ﻿For 40 years I fixed all the tractors and trucks on the farm. ﻿With wings, without wings... ﻿a machine is a machine. ﻿There's something special about old machines. ﻿But you'll never understand. ﻿Like a spirit? ﻿Yes. ﻿A spirit. ﻿Every beautiful object has a spirit in it. ﻿Especially old things that have ' been through unique experiences ﻿and affected people's lives. ﻿Can you help us fix it? ﻿Maybe a little, ﻿so you won't hurt yourselves. ﻿Or even worse, ﻿damage the plane. ﻿Relax, there's lots of work ahead of you. ﻿You know what? I have a research task for you. ﻿Can you operate an internet? ﻿It really is a rare plane. ﻿I can't find much about it online. ﻿Where is this? -What? ﻿Oh, that. ﻿It's on a trip to the lake. ﻿Our last photo together. ﻿You look alike. ﻿Yotami, I'm home! ﻿Shall we? ﻿Hi, Mom. This is... -Noa? ﻿Hi, I'm Michal. I heard a lot about you. ﻿Yeah? What did you hear? ﻿Just that you and Yotam... ﻿go to school together. ﻿That's right. ﻿Did Yotam offer you something to drink? -Of course. ﻿Noa, you gotta go home, right? -Right. ﻿Bye. -You're always welcome here! ﻿Why do you always have to embarrass me? ﻿I'm sorry, what did I say? ﻿Forget it. ﻿She's so cute, how's it going with her? ﻿Nothing's going with her. ﻿If you guys hang out all the time, maybe she's into you. ﻿No way. ﻿We just do homework together. ﻿Either way, I'm out of her league. ﻿No way! You're a rare find. ﻿A hunk. -Stop it, Mom. ﻿Enough talk about me. ﻿Let's talk about you for a change. ﻿How's your love life? ﻿Why? ﻿You think I should... ﻿start dating? ﻿I don't know. If you want to. ﻿No, I feel it's too soon. ﻿If you want to, I'm cool with it. ﻿That's all you could find on that internet of yours? ﻿You can't restore a plane with that. ﻿Maybe at an amusement park. -Are you sure it's no good? ﻿No! -We checked every site on the web! ﻿This is all we could find. -It's no good. ﻿We need the original blueprints. ﻿Help me flnd them ﻿This is so vintage! ﻿Do me a favor, put it back where you found it. We don't have all day. ﻿Where did I put it? My memory... ﻿Is this you? ﻿Let me see! -Look. ﻿Morris, you had so much hair! -Awesome. ﻿Who are these people? ﻿My son Dudi and my grandkids. ﻿They live in San Diego. ﻿They don't come to visit, so they send me photos, occasionally. ﻿Never mind... ﻿We didn't come here to get all sentimental. ﻿What's in the box down there? ﻿Look what I found. -What is it? ﻿Were you a pilot?! ﻿Who said I was a pilot? ﻿It still fits! ﻿That's ancient history, dinosaur era. ﻿You found it! ﻿Great. ﻿Morris! ﻿Did you fly Messerschmitts in the War of Independence?! ﻿I'm not that old. ﻿I flew Mustangs back in the '50s. ﻿In the War of Independence I was 10 years old. ﻿I remember that almost every day the city was bombed. ﻿When everyone ran to the shelters, ﻿I'd climb up to the roof to watch the planes. ﻿My poor mother, I got her so worried. ﻿One day I climbed up to the roof ﻿and I see a bomber flying above the city, picking his next target. ﻿But then, a small Messerschmitt appeared ﻿with a huge Star of David on it ﻿and started to chase the bomber. ﻿The bomber tried to escape, but he couldn't. ﻿The Messerschmitt didn't let go ﻿until he shot him down. ﻿The city was relieved. ﻿That day I decided: ﻿I will become a pilot. ﻿Morris, ﻿you should fly the Messerschmitt. ﻿Enough with this nonsense. ﻿Yeah, you have to fly it at the air show! ﻿This plane is a pile of junk. ﻿It'll never fly again. Just like me. ﻿Just because it's old doesn't mean it's done for... ﻿The most we can do is paint it, clean it up ﻿and show it at the air show ground exhibit. ﻿But fly it? ﻿Get your heads out of the clouds. ﻿I think it's mixed pretty good. ﻿Say, Morris... ﻿how can you tell... « ﻿if someone likes you? ﻿Noa? ﻿No! ﻿In general. ﻿Yes. ﻿Back in my day, you'd invite her to the movies. ﻿Seriously? ﻿In our day, we watch movies, too. ﻿But usually at home. Should I invite her? ﻿Of course. ﻿But there's a catch: ﻿If she says yes, that's good. ﻿But if she invites her girlfriends to join... ﻿Gotcha. ﻿Next weekend well finish fixing the wings. ﻿We should celebrate. How about going to the movies? ﻿I don't feel like going to the movies. ﻿Sitting in the dark, shoving popcorn... ﻿What? Like a date? ﻿No, not a date. Don't be ridiculous. ﻿Just a movie, at home. ﻿But I don't like all those stupid rom-coms. We can watch an action film ﻿with loads of explosions. ﻿Maybe. ﻿Hi, Nono. Who's the friend? ﻿This is Yotam, we go to school together. ﻿Want to join us for dinner? ﻿Have you met Noa's friend? ﻿He's new in town. ﻿Yeah, we met at the hangar. ﻿So Nono has a boyfriend? ﻿He's just a friend, ﻿from school. ﻿Okay, my mistake. ﻿So what does your father do, Yotam? ﻿He also served in the Air Force. ﻿Really? ﻿Where was he stationed? Maybe I know him. We were on a base up north. ﻿I served there for a few years, I know tons of people. ﻿What's his name? ﻿I don't think you know him. -Yotam moved here ﻿because his mom got a job at a big agricultural export company. ﻿She heads the office at the new industrial park. ﻿Senior vegetable clerk. ﻿She's an executive. ﻿Noa will be a great executive too one day, ﻿if she stops spending all day with planes and engines. ﻿Grease monkey. -Shut up. ﻿You shut up. ﻿As if there aren't any women pilots in the Air Force. ﻿Sweetie, ﻿you're a straight-A student, you have tons of friends, ﻿you're beautiful, you're great in sports, dance... ﻿You're amazing. ﻿But remember the damage you did ﻿to the Black Spit? ﻿And Ofer told me you crashed your model airplane. ﻿Sweetie, ﻿leave the planes to me and Ofer, okay? ﻿Ehud, ﻿why don't you tell her about the idea we had? ﻿If you want, you can help us tomorrow with the Spit. ﻿What for?! We can manage alone! ﻿Ofer, enough. After running the engine the Spit will be covered in soot ﻿and I thought you'd like to wash it. ﻿Your friend can come too if he wants. ﻿The perfect job for you two. ﻿Thanks for the offer, but we're busy. ﻿We're working on a... -A project. ﻿A project for school. ﻿Good. ﻿What project? ﻿Geography. -Literature. ﻿Literature. -Geography. ﻿Geography, geography. ﻿About the continental drift or something like that. ﻿I thought you'd like to help ﻿but the continental drift is more important. ﻿So she says: Take out your pencils, time fora pop quiz. ﻿Seriously? -We couldn't believe it. ﻿Just because one kid was goofing around. -Really? ﻿Next week we have an exam and I haven't started studying yet. ﻿That schemer... ﻿Hold it like that, it has to be tighter. ﻿You see ﻿I don't believe it. ﻿It really is a Messerschmitt. ﻿And not in bad condition. ﻿The continental drift, huh? ﻿Where did you find it, Nono? ﻿The guys from the museum won't believe it when they come pick it up. ﻿What museum? ﻿Dad, it's our plane. -"Our plane..." ﻿Sweetie, it's not a toy. ﻿You may not know, ﻿but this is a rare piece of history. ﻿You'll damage it, no way. ﻿But Morris is helping us, he was in the Air Force. ﻿He knows everything about old planes. ﻿Morris, the old geezer from the shabby house? ﻿Yes. ﻿That old geezer. ﻿You were in the Air Force? ﻿50 years ago. ﻿Ever heard of Squadron 101 ﻿Respect. ﻿The kids and I are fixing up this antique a little bit, ﻿then we'll hand it over to the museum. ﻿It'll be a nice for the old timers ﻿to see this special plane at the annual airshow. ﻿Dad, please. ﻿We're being careful and Morris is watching us. ﻿You want them to steal all the attention at the air show? ﻿He's an old man, he needs this to pass the time. ﻿Besides, it'll keep your sister busy ﻿and off my back. ﻿What if they try to fly it at the air show? ﻿Fly it? ﻿Morris, explain to him. ﻿Are you kidding me? ﻿This hunkof junk will fall apart on the runway. ﻿See? ﻿It's an amazing plane, for the ground exhibit. ﻿You can work on it until the air show] ﻿then it's going to the museum. ﻿Understood? -Yes. ﻿Have fun and be careful. ﻿Ofer, let's go. ﻿You can fool Dad, but not me. ﻿If you try to steal the show' from the Black Spit, ﻿it'll be your end. Got it? ﻿Your dad is right. ﻿I'm an old geezer and the plane is a piece of junk. ﻿You're not an old geezer and this isn't a piece of junk! ﻿Morris, what's your dream? ﻿People my age don't have dreams. ﻿Come with me. -What? ﻿Come on. -What? ﻿How bad is the engine? ﻿It's a mess, but I've seen worse. ﻿Why do you care? ﻿Because you... ﻿are gonna fly it in the air show. ﻿And show everyone what you're worth. ﻿I haven't flown in years. ﻿Then renew your license. ﻿You two decided to drive me nuts. ﻿It's a lot of work ﻿and we only have a couple of months, ﻿it's not enough time. ﻿So are you going to... ﻿If we fix the engine in time, ﻿I'll fly it in the air show. ﻿It'll be a great way to go out with a bang. ﻿Get off me! ﻿You two get sentimental about everything. ﻿Not good, Yotam. ﻿Tell your mom to give me a call. ﻿Flaps 20 degrees, ﻿throttle 2500 rpm, ﻿pulling in 120 kph... ﻿Don't forget the rudder or you'll flip over! ﻿Spitfire on your tail! ﻿You brat! Not in the middle of the lesson! ﻿Get over here! ﻿Anyway our Messerschmitt has no chance against the Spitfire. ﻿Spitfires are way stronger. ﻿In a dogfight, a good pilot is more important than a good plane. ﻿But how can you beat a stronger plane? ﻿Stand here. ﻿You stand here. ﻿You're a Spitfire, okay? ﻿Yotam! An enemy Spitfire is on your tail! ﻿She has you in her crosshairs! ﻿She's gonna take you down! What do you do? ﻿I shot you down! ﻿You can't shake her off your tail. What do you do? ﻿What do you do? ﻿All right, listen up. ﻿There's a maneuver from the old days called "Guns Jink." ﻿It's relatively simple, but very effective in these situations. ﻿You pull your stick all the way to the right ﻿and push the rudder right. ﻿You break to the side and let your opponent pass you ﻿and now you're on his tail. ﻿Got it? Give it a try. ﻿Go for it! ﻿Yotam, now you're on her tail, ﻿shoot her down! ﻿Bravo! ﻿Next time I'll shoot you down. ﻿In your dreams. -All right... ﻿Next week you're on vacation from school, right? ﻿I have a surprise for you. ﻿Well meet at the airfield at 8 am. Don't be late. ﻿See? ﻿This is the plus, this is the minus, ﻿And now we'll tighten the screws. ﻿Noa, can ou et me a socket wrench? We watched a movie. ﻿That's good.. But she invited her girlfriends. ﻿That's not good. ﻿But she held my hand. In the scary parts. ﻿That's good. -Yeah. ﻿Morris, how do you... ﻿kiss a girl? ﻿Here it is. ﻿Too big. ﻿How do you kiss a girl? ﻿Let me think... ﻿Oh, with your lips. ﻿I know that, but... ﻿how do you get that to happen?' ﻿Back in my day, you gave her a gift. Like a bonbonniaere. ﻿Here. Is this okay? ﻿Too small. We need something not too big, not too small. ﻿I'm not your gopher! ﻿Bonbonniãere? What's that? ﻿It's a box ﻿full of Swiss chocolate. ﻿Give her one of those. ﻿and the rest will take care of itself. ﻿Thanks, Morris. ﻿You're a real artist! ﻿Here are all the wrenches we got. ﻿What are you guys gossiping about? ﻿Morris and I were just talking about Chocolate. -Chocolate?! ﻿I love chocolate! ﻿Good morning. ﻿Wow, so much energy! ﻿I don't recall ever seeing you out of bed ﻿so early on vacation day. What's going on? ﻿Nothing, I'm hanging out with Noa. ﻿Did you get the math test back yet? ﻿Yotam, I haven't seen you ﻿studying for weeks. ﻿What about homework? ﻿I'll do it later. -No way. ﻿Finish your homework, then friends. ﻿But Mom, it's not fair, ﻿Noa will be here any minute now. ﻿End of discussion. Homework comes first. ﻿Ready? Morris said we can't be late. ﻿Quiet, not now. ﻿Why are you making those faces? ﻿Hi, Noa. ﻿Yotam is staying home to study today. ﻿You're welcome to join him. ﻿Who's Morris? ﻿Morris is... ﻿An elderly man from the community involvement project. ﻿It's a school initiative. ﻿We spend time with him ﻿and in return he helps us with math. ﻿We're supposed to meet with him to go over our homework ﻿but if I can't go, ﻿can you help us? ﻿It's just linear inequalities. ﻿Not that complicated. ﻿If you're going to study, that's fine. ﻿Why didn't you say so? ﻿Great! I'll be back for dinner. ﻿Yotam. ﻿What was that all about? ﻿What? ﻿You know, with your mom. ﻿She can't know about our plane. ﻿Why not? ﻿After what happened to my dad... ﻿She just can't. ﻿Let's go! Ready to practice? ﻿Are we going to fly this plane?! ﻿I can't believe it! ﻿Shotgun! ﻿You coming? ﻿It's been a few years since the last time I flew. ﻿Let's see what I remember. ﻿You're not serious. ﻿Flying is like riding a bike, right? ﻿Worst case, you crash once or twice, ﻿then it all comes back. ﻿Come on. ﻿Want to take the controls? ﻿Really? ﻿I have the flight controls. ﻿Take us west. ﻿Turn until the compass points 270. ﻿Don't forget the rudder... ﻿See what I'm doing? ﻿Good job. ﻿Yotam, now it's your turn. ﻿You have the flight controls. ﻿Take over. ﻿We'll turn south. Look at the compass, ﻿Rate-of-climb indicator: 500 feet per minute. ﻿Good. ﻿Can I do a sharper turn? ﻿As long as you maintain altitude. ﻿It requires some skill. ﻿Good job, just like an experienced pilot! ﻿Okay, time to go back. I have the flight controls. ﻿Alpha November Golf, ﻿1500 feet, ready for landing. ﻿Alpha November Golf, you're cleared to descend to 1000 feet, ﻿use runway 1-4. -Runway 1-4, roger. ﻿Decreasing altitude to 1000. ﻿Alpha November Golf, final. ﻿Alpha November Golf, final. ﻿What are you doing?! ﻿Have you lost your mind? ﻿What's wrong with you? ﻿Yotam! ﻿Are you okay? ﻿My mom is right. ﻿I'll never be a pilot. ﻿What are you talking about? ﻿You were born to fly, I saw you up there. ﻿You feel the plane, you're a natural. ﻿But my asthma... ﻿It's not the asthma. ﻿What happened? ﻿When we were about to land, ﻿it reminded me how my dad... ﻿What happened to him? ﻿I didn't tell anyone ﻿because I don't want kids at school to know. ﻿Promise not to tell? ﻿Promise. ﻿My dad was on a training flight with a new jet, ﻿a really expensive one. ﻿Something went wrong with the engine ﻿and it caught on fire. ﻿He could've saved himself with the ejection seat, ﻿but he decided to try and save the plane. ﻿Just before the runway, ﻿he hit the ground. ﻿Noa, can you get a glass of water? ﻿There are moments in life when we... ﻿fall and crash to the ground. ﻿We feel there's nothing worth living for. ﻿But then, you must remember your goal. ﻿Because when a goal is burning inside, nothing can stop you. ﻿Understand? ﻿Here's the water. ﻿Enough talk. ﻿Don't we have work to do? ﻿Yes. We have a plane to finish. ﻿Bravo. ﻿What is this? ﻿It's barbaric. ﻿Who could've done such a thing? ﻿Must be my jerk brother. ﻿Can you prove it? ﻿Not that it matters now. ﻿We can't fix it in time for the air show. ﻿There must be a way to put it back together. ﻿Yotam, you need special tools. ﻿We'll get them, we'll buy them. ﻿No, you need a special tool ﻿for antique planes. ﻿Where would you find an old riveter? ﻿Come on! ﻿I can't believe that dumb salesman thought you're 18. ﻿Can't wait to get hammered! ﻿You can't smoke here. ﻿Your dad will kill you. ﻿I can do whatever I want here. ﻿Wanna see something cool? -Sure. ﻿What is it, bro? ﻿Where'd you get that? ﻿From my sister's junker. ﻿She thought she'd show it off at the air show, ﻿but it ain't gonna happen. ﻿You're such a genius, bro. ﻿"But it ain't gonna happen." ﻿Voilaa. ﻿What do you think? -Wow, bro... ﻿You're gonna look like Bruce Lee. -I am Bruce Lee. ﻿Oh my god! ﻿Get back here! ﻿My falafel! ﻿Hey, kid! -Zvika, get over here! ﻿Zvika! ﻿You dumbass, where were you? ﻿I almost forgot my falafel, dude! ﻿Here, turn here! ﻿Come on, Zvika! ﻿Catch them, catch them. -Zvika is coming! ﻿Get out. ﻿Wait! ﻿Back up. ﻿Go already! ﻿Damn, the falafel. ﻿The falafel's all over you... ﻿Noa! I'm gonna kill you, you hear me?! ﻿You're dead meat! ﻿Best operation ever. ﻿Gimme five! -Five? Gimme a hug! We better get started. ﻿Let's start-- ﻿I almost forgot. ﻿I brought us a snack. ﻿How did you know that's my favorite? ﻿I've got my sources. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Nothing. ﻿What? -Want some more chocolate? ﻿Were you trying to kiss me? ﻿No! As if! ﻿You can be really funny sometimes. ﻿What do you say? ﻿You did it. ﻿You... ﻿brought the plane back to life. ﻿I wish Rachel could've seen We were married 52 years. ﻿When she passed away, ﻿it was so hard. ﻿You could say that... ﻿for a long time I haven't had any family. ﻿But now I've got you two. ﻿Enough, enough. ﻿See what you did? ﻿You made me too sentimental. ﻿The air show is just a few days away ﻿and we have to finish the paint job, ﻿and most important - to train. ﻿Who wants to be my co-pilot? ﻿Me! -Me! ﻿Your turn. ﻿Good flying, kids. ﻿You have plenty more to learn, ﻿but you impress me every time. ﻿Are you all right? -Yeah, it's hot... ﻿Too damn hot today. ﻿Wanna go to the plane? Well finish painting. ﻿I have to return the riveter, ﻿let's talk later? ﻿Hello. ﻿You know you're off limits. ﻿What's in your bag? ﻿Dad would love to hear1 you stole equipment? ﻿I'll be sure to mention ﻿that you vandalized a historic plane. ﻿Is that an accusation? ﻿Too bad you have no proof. ﻿Where'd you get it? ﻿From my sister's junker. ﻿She thought she'd show it off at the air show... ﻿What's come over you lately? ﻿Since you started hanging out with that kid, ﻿you've become such a pain. ﻿What do you have against Yotam? ﻿He's a cocky jerk for one. ﻿Sounds like someone else I know. ﻿He's competing against me, against us. ﻿Did you forget which family you belong to? ﻿Don't you want the Black Spit to be the best? ﻿You and Dad made it clear that I'm not part of your team ﻿and Yotam ﻿is more of a brother to me than you've ever been! ﻿Is that really how you feel? ﻿You've been the biggest asshole trying to ruin everything for me. ﻿Why? ﻿Everything you do, ﻿you're the best. ﻿You're a better student, you're more popular, ﻿“everybody loves you, without you even making an effort. ﻿Then there's one thing, one! ﻿That I do with Dad and that's aviation, ﻿and once more you gotta prove you're better than me. ﻿I'm not trying to compete with you. I swear. ﻿And now Yotam is more a brother to you than me. ﻿It's not like that. ﻿We have a special connection. He's been through a lot. ﻿Okay. ﻿Like what? ﻿Noa, ﻿if you don't share anything ^with me, ﻿how can we understand each other? If I tell you, ﻿do you promise to leave him alone? ﻿Hey, Yotam. -Hold on a sec. ﻿Hold on a sec. ﻿I just want a word with you. ﻿Actually, ﻿I wanted to apologize. ﻿Me, too. ﻿I'm sure it's hard to move to a new place ﻿and I haven't made it easy on you. ﻿All the kids made fun about your asthma ﻿and it wasn't fair. ﻿I was hoping we could put all that behind us. ﻿Yeah. What do you say? ﻿All right. -All right. ﻿Good luck at the air show with your plane. ﻿Good thing you aren't flying it. ﻿You'd probably crash it just like your dad. ﻿Noa told us that crashing planes ﻿runs in your family. ﻿That's not true! ﻿My dad could've ejected, he was trying to save the jet. ﻿I'm Yotam's dad. -And? ﻿My engine's on fire! -It's right in front of you! ﻿Where's the eject button? -I can't find it! ﻿Stay down. ﻿That's where you belong. ﻿Shut up. ﻿Where have you been? I'm almost done with the paint... ﻿What happened? ﻿How does Ofer know about my dad? ﻿What? I... -Why did you tell him?! ﻿I didn't tell you so you could go around telling everybody. ﻿I'm sorry... -I trusted you. You swore! ﻿I'm sorry, ﻿I was trying to help. ﻿I thought Ofer would leave you alone. -What did you think?! ﻿How could it help? ﻿Why is it such a secret? Your dad was a hero! ﻿Don't you understand I just want to be like everyone else? ﻿Be normal, not have fingers pointed at me at school? ﻿I'm sorry. I didn't think he'd go tell everyone. ﻿What do you know anyway? ﻿You have both parents. ﻿You don't know what it's like to have real problems. ﻿That's not true... -It is true! ﻿What problems do you have?! ﻿You're just a spoiled rich kid, ﻿fighting with her brother who has a better plane! ﻿You really think so? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Ready for a dress rehearsal? ﻿Wow. ﻿You look like a real pilot. ﻿I am a real pilot! ﻿Where's Noa? She's never late like this. ﻿I think she quit. ﻿A day before the air show? Doesn't make much sense. ﻿Did something happen? ﻿Come on, let's move the barrel away from the plane. ﻿Are you okay?, ﻿I'm fine. Come on. ﻿Checklist! ﻿Fuel switch? ﻿Set to P1 and P2. ﻿Throttle? -Open one inch. ﻿Battery switch? ﻿Open position. ﻿Magnetos? -Set to M1 and M2. ﻿Keep your fingers crossed... ﻿Yes! ﻿You okay? ﻿feel a little dizzy... ﻿Morris! Morris! ﻿Thanks for calling me. Yotam. ﻿Are you okay? -Mom... ﻿Are you okay? ﻿Get in the car. -I didn't do anything... ﻿It's okay, let's go home. ﻿Can we drive to the hospital? ﻿No. We're going home. ﻿I want to make sense of the story that the police told me. ﻿Was that old man important to you? ﻿You won't understand. ﻿Of course not, because you don't tell me anything. ﻿We planned that Morris will fly the plane tomorrow. ﻿More lies? -I'm not lying! ﻿Really? ﻿I found this in your backpack. ﻿Nothing but lies. ﻿It's because I knew you wouldn't let me work on the plane. ﻿I have good reason not to let you! ﻿Planes are dangerous. ﻿Look what happened to that old man because of your ideas. ﻿I can't believe I trusted you. ﻿If you'd let me do what I want, ﻿I wouldn't have to hide everything from you. Yotam. ﻿you have asthma, don't you get it? ﻿No matter what, ﻿you will never be a pilot. ﻿My asthma has nothing to do with it, ﻿it's just an excuse. ﻿It's because what happened to Dad. ﻿Yes. ﻿I still haven't forgiven your father ﻿that he made me bury him at the age of 35. ﻿rm not going to bury you, too ﻿Look this way. ﻿Ofer, how about sunglasses? Top Gun style? ﻿Nono, want to join the picture? ﻿It's a picture of the pilots. -Take the picture. ﻿Morris got sick. He's in intensive care. ﻿Dear Yotam, Follow your dreams as high as they take you. Love, Dad ﻿Excuse me, not now. ﻿Hi. ﻿Hi. ﻿Have you seen him? ﻿Only for a few seconds. ﻿He had a heart attack, ﻿tomorrow they'll know more about his condition. ﻿Noa, about yesterday... ﻿I shouldn't have said what I said. ﻿I got angry and took it out on you. ﻿Forget it, it doesn't matter now. ﻿I'm really sorry I told my brother. ﻿I can't believe I trusted him. ﻿So this is the end of the road. ﻿Remember what the plane looked like ﻿when we found it? ﻿Yeah, it was full of pigeon poop. ﻿So much work. ﻿And it's ready to go, like brand-new. ﻿We don't have to give up. Yotam, ﻿the air show is tomorrow. Where are we gonna find a pilot? ﻿Come on! ﻿Happy Independence Day and Welcome to the Air Force Museum. ﻿Boy, have we got ﻿an air show for you today! ﻿Yotami, are you coming to have breakfast? ﻿It's already after 10:00 ﻿AIR SHOW AT THE MUSEUM The Black Spit is back in the sky! ﻿Today's highlight - the return of the Black Spit! ﻿Generator switch? -Open position. ﻿Fuel pump? -Open position. ﻿Magneto? -Set to M1 and M2. ﻿You can turn on the engine. ﻿There's just one little thing... ﻿How do we get out of here? ﻿Don't worry, I thought of everything! ﻿That was your plan? ﻿It's a special saw for steel! w ﻿Start her up! ﻿Cheers for the F-16s of Squadron 101! ﻿And now, what you've all been waiting for: ﻿Black Spit, cleared for taxi. ﻿I can't believe we're doing this, it's totally insane. ﻿Should we call it off? ﻿No way! Push the throttle, ﻿we need 120 kph to take off. ﻿The trees! ﻿Help me pull! ﻿We're gonna run into the trees! ﻿If you look over at the runway ﻿you'll see the Black Spit preparing for takeoff. ﻿Spit, abort takeoff! ﻿What the hell was that? ﻿It's Morris' Messerschmitt. ﻿What a takeoff! -Excuse me, can I get through? ﻿Wait, that's not the Black Spit. ﻿It's a Messerschmitt! ﻿Spit, stay grounded until we figure out the situation. ﻿Are you gonna let that old fart take our showtime?! ﻿How could that be? Noa said he's in the hospital. ﻿The crazy old fool must've run away. ﻿Roger, cleared for take off. ﻿Negative, negative! ﻿Folks, it just keeps getting better. ﻿Looks like the Black Spit ﻿I wish Morris could see us. ﻿He should've been up here. ﻿Where to? ﻿Morris! ﻿Morris! -Morris! ﻿Sir, please get back in bed! ﻿Hold on tight. ﻿We're gonna force the old man to land. ﻿Hell yeah! ﻿What was that? -The Black Spit! ﻿Here we go. ﻿Ladies and gentlemen, what a surprise! ﻿They're recreating a historic dogfight for us! ﻿Your dad is a combat pilot, we're just two kids! ﻿Well never shake him off. ﻿Should we land? ﻿Remember that trick Morris taught us? ﻿Guns Jink. You think the plane will hold? ﻿Only one way to find out. ﻿Where'd he go? ﻿He's on our tail! -How did he get there?! ﻿What? ﻿The old man is crazy. ﻿I'm not messing with him. ﻿Tower, this is the Spit. Coming in for landing. ﻿Thank God! -No way, Dad! We can still beat him! ﻿Ofer, shut up ﻿or I'll throw you out! ﻿That was awesome! Did you see that? ﻿Okay, time to land. ﻿Watch the airspeed. Yotam...

Yotam! ﻿Yotam! ﻿I'm sorry. -I thought I was dying. ﻿How do know how to fly like that? ﻿I don't even know what punishment I'm supposed to give you. ﻿I wish your dad could've seen you today. ﻿Dad! She's crazy, what are you doing?! ﻿Ofer, enough already. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿We can't say goodbye from back there. ﻿When do you think well fly it again? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Don't touch, you brats! ﻿Get away from there! ﻿Morris! ﻿Come over here. ﻿Enough with the sentimentality. ﻿I'm here on official duty. ﻿Follow me. ﻿There's a special story about this plane. ﻿Two kids found it in a junkyard and fixed it up. ﻿There was an old guy who helped them out...
