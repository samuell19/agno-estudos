- Hi Miss Pia. Good morning! - Hi. How are you? Fine, we're fine. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Bye. Thank you. - Come back soon! See you soon. Have you finished doing the income projection? How about the budget for 2009 to 2011? I'm sorry, which one? The one we talked about yesterday. Hello, Franco! Yes, Franco. Please tell Mia to photocopy them. Tell her to make it colored. Dad wants to review all the marketing materials. So he should see the exact design. Hello? It's Franco again. - Hello! - Hello? Yes sir. It's your brother. It's Greg again. Hello? Nothing, just a text message. Ms. Pia, you have a 9am presentation with Sir Santi's guests... please don't be late. Also, make sure that you have your AVP ready so he won't be humiliated. Yes, please tell him l' ll be there before 9 o' clock. Okay, bye. Bye Dara. - Hi Miss Rhina. - Ma'am Pia? - Are we ready? - I had no time to consult you. I made some revisions on our staffing and compensation plan. Let me see. We really need to give incentives to people to increase their productivity. - Good morning, ma'am! - Hello. Good morning! Good morning. Are we ready? Ma'am Pia, here are the samples. Sample? Let me see. Good morning. - Okay, sure, bye. - Good morning, sir. Gomez! Is this what you did yesterday? - Yes, ma'am. - Nice job! Gomez, what's up? No, no, no! Tell them we cannot postpone anymore. - Are we all okay? - Okay, bye. Good morning, sir Greg. Hi brother! - Good morning. So, you're ready? - Yes, ready? Yes, yes. Yes, of course! - We' re ready! - Good. The meeting will start in 10 minutes. Dad's already in the parking lot. I'll see you all in the board room. Gino, you need help? Are you okay? Ma'am Pia, here are the samples. Guys, okay, go! Only 10 minutes left guys. You take charge. Greg! - What time will Sophia be presenting? - In 10 minutes, sir... - and we can start. - Good morning. You know I really like the brochure. It's clean, it's attractive... it's the kind of material that will really be... effective for the client of Triant Towers. It's really nice, guys. Good work. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. Nice, but I think the production cost is too high for these materials. Even the maintenance cost of the website is too expensive... while your projected ROl is small. You even reduced the quota for the sales agents and managers. Ms. Rhina recommended it. Her opinions are usually on target... because she is more experienced and knowledgeable than me. That may be true. But her opinion is just an opinion. How about you? Do you agree with her opinion? - Yes, sir. - Did you even study these materials? Sophia, lowering your standards... and expectations of your people only breeds mediocrity. Do you really think you are helping them by raising their pay and incentives? If this company cannot raise the funds to finance your proposals... we will all lose. I' ll review all the- Revise your entire plan and present it again on Monday. And I also want you to submit an initial market research... - for our condotel in Palawan. - Yes, sir. But Dad, Pia's going to Greece next week. What? We told Dara. Dara, did you not tell him? Sorry! No, it will be too late. I can take over as the Project Head. Coordinate with your team. And I expect your revised marketing plan and budget... to be a thousand times better than the one you gave today. Is there anything else? No, sir. No, sir. You may leave now. Let's go! - Pia? - Brother? When was the last time you planned to resign? My birthday, March... two years ago. Come on Pia, you know how he is. What if I cancel my trip to Santorini? - No! - I still have loads of work to do. No. You are not postponing that trip again. But I cannot leave all my work behind. The more reason for you to take a vacation. - Dad will get mad again. - You need to relax... to forget all your problems. And when you come back... that's when you decide if you will resign or not. Trust me. Take the vacation. Franco, please just e- mail me all the reports, okay? And l' ll read it as soon as I get home tonight. I promise you l' ll reply to you before I go abroad. - Franco, we need to cut costs... - Whoa! - Sorry. - Billie! Billie, wait! Stop it! Billie, give that back to me. That call is important. Please don't call Pia for the next 3 hours. She's having fun with her friends. Guys! Pi's here. Hi Pi. Hey Pia. Hi guys! Go, enjoy the night! Congratulations. Are you happy? I' m so happy for you. You know what Pia, I swear, if you're not my friend... I would think that you have really given up on male species of human race. Or maybe it's them who have given up on her because of her busy lifestyle. Imagine, she's busier than my whole family, and we' re Chinese. Come on, guys. Selene, do you really think that I don't want to have a life outside of the office? - Yeah! - Of course I do. Just that, I still have so many things to learn about the business. And you know how Dad is. He always gives me huge responsibilities. You guys know that. - Busy busy busy! - Oh my god! - What? - You guys, Oh my god. At 6 o'clock all the way to the back. Carmen Gonzales? Can you believe it? Don't go look all at once. - You first. - One at a time. - Is it true she just came out of rehab? - Really? Oh, well but of course. She was with the great Seth Villaraza. He broke her heart and she got hooked on drugs. Oh my god! Your Seth Villaraza really gives nothing but trouble. - Don't say that. - And yet you defend him. You know Pia, Seth is a nice guy. - He's just misunderstood. That's all. - I agree! Really? Tell me how could a playboy... narcissistic, boastful and feeling good- looking... feeling movie star, who thinks of himself as God's gift to women, be nice? You Marianne got fooled by tutorial. I heard you give tutorials for Calculus subject. - I'm Marianne. - I know! While Selene got fooled by a dog. - Oh, is it a boy or a girl... - Cute dog. I have a dog too. His name's Gelato. And you Billie, got fooled by a simple picture. Look. - Okay, one more! - Smile! Smile! Smile! After deceiving all of you, what happened? The three of you came to me crying... because he left all of you without explaining why. He's sorry that he had to break up with me. It's been 3 months. He just realized that although I'm the perfect girl... ... I'm just not the right girl for him. There, there. I want to die. I hate you! I hate you! Stop it, sweetie! It's okay. Now you're telling me he' s a good guy? No, really, Seth is a nice guy. In fact, when we were together, he's faithful. Actually he's the perfect boyfriend. What? Until I met you, love. Perfect... until he breaks your heart. As for me, l' m glad he's out out of my life. And I found my perfect man, Mark over here. You guys, you, you, you, you, you! Take good care of my friends, okay? They deserve guys who will respect them... support them, will not hurt them and will fight for them. You know Pia, you cannot compare us with Seth or even with Ocampo. Who's Ocampo? Pia's ex- boyfriend. The guy who broke her heart. Nanny, why are you dressed like that? Let's go. I' m excited to go to Greece. But we won't be leaving until tomorrow. Pia, I waited so long to see Benjo. Don't make jokes like that. It's not funny. I' ll wait for you outside. Hurry up. - Please! - Suit yourself. Hmp! Mosquitoes are biting me. She might have taken a shower first. Hey Nanny, watch your step! Greece! There he is, there! Nanny! Careful! - I think we should just call a cab. - No, Benjo's coming. - But the cab's just over there. - No! Okay, okay. Relax. Nanny, are you sure you told Benjo that we' re coming? Of course. How could I forget that? I could forget anything else including you. But that, I will not forget. Let's just wait for few minutes more, okay? Nanny, we've been waiting here for 2 hours! I could have finished loads of work! I' m sweating here, and all you think about is work. Maybe that pen pal of yours doesn't want to show up. Ouch. Stop it, Sophia. Don't say that. You' re hurting my feelings. Josie? Josie? Josie! It's Benjo! - Benjo? - Yes, Josie? I' m glad you came. We've waited for so long. I thought you're not coming. Sorry for being late, ma'am Pia. But time runs differently here in Greece. Hey, that's beautiful. Ma'am Pia, my life is indebted to you... for bringing my sweetheart here in Santorini. My life is now complete, I can now die happy. What?! We just came here. Don't die yet! Ma'am, I assure you, my intentions for Josie are pure and decent. Even if it's indecent, it's okay with me. Ma'am, do you plan to stay long here? Just a week. Oh, it's not obvious with your baggage. Sorry sweetheart, Pia here is not very familiar with the word vacation. - Benjo? - Yes? Are you sure it's okay with your boss that we stay at your place? I' m sure. Sir Alex is a good guy and he knows you're coming. Okay. That' s good. Benjo, how long have you been working here? 8 years. I used to be a waiter and a cook. I just got promoted when Sir Alex started to manage the taverna. 8 years? When did you get promoted? 6 months ago, when the owner of the taverna... Sir Stav left for Colombia. He found out that his first love Elena got widowed. He planned to close down the taverna to be with her. Then? When Sir Alex found that the taverna will be closed down, he felt sorry for us. So he volunteered to manage the taverna. Oh, how romantic Stav and Elena's story is. Imagine, Stav waited for Elena's husband to die... then he left everything for her. - That is sweet. - Nanny, that's not sweet. He didn't care about Benjo and his other workers. Good thing there is someone who really cares for them. You know what Pia, when you fall in love, you will eat your words. Ah, no nanny. I will not let that happen to me. - You can never can tell. - You can never can tell. - Pendong kulas! - Pendong kulas! Beautiful! - Sweetheart, are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. I forgot to tell you how narrow the staircases... - in Greece are. - Sorry for the luggage. You can stay at the room of Sir Stav, Ma'am Pia. Nanny, what are these? Oh, what am I going to use this for? Wait a second. Correct me if l' m wrong. Did you not tell me that we should always be beautiful? What if you find some guy here in Santorini... then you fall in love with him? Do you want him to see you looking like an old maid? You know it's not my plan here in Greece to look for a long distance relationship. You know what I need to do? I need to think! I need to study and I need to rest! Chit, bro. Like what I've told you last week, I cannot join you. I mean, if Regatta is far from the Philippines, I won't hesitate to join. But if my mom finds out that l' m just near the Philippines... she won't let me come back here. You know what, you should try living here in Greece. Life here is simple, with delicious food and pretty ladies. I' m tired. I' ll just stay here. - How about you? Are you not tired yet? - I don't want to waste my time sleeping! Nanny, are you not forgetting something? Yes. Good thing you told me. It's hot outside. Okay, l' ll leave now. Bye. Nanny, you're still forgetting something. What else? Oh yeah, I stink. - Let me use your cologne, will you? - Uhmmm. This is how I should put on cologne, right? - Thanks. I' ll go ahead. - Really, I taught you that? You' re good. Okay, l' ll see you later. Nanny! What?! Aren't you even going to wear pants? Is that it? No need. I' m wearing undies. Hideous. I' m ready. I was born ready. Let's go. Benjo. Benjo! What the... - Rapist! Maniac! - Hey, wait wait! - You' re sick! What are you doing here?! - Hey, if you think I will rape you... I' m not that drunk and l' ll have you pay for what you're doing! Aren't you going to answer that? Hello? - Nanny, where are you? - Sophia, make sure this is important. - Nanny, a maniac broke in my room. - Because if it's not... - What? - Come here! Hurry! We need to go home. Hurry! - You- - Pia, who did you kill? - Benjo, help me here. - What happened? Who is that? Who is he? Ma'am Pia, don't you know who he is? That is the worthless ex- boyfriend of every girl, of every one! - Of all the unfortunate things to happen. - He is Sir Alex. My boss, the manager. That is your manager? Impossible! He is a cheater! Do you know how many girls cried because of that guy? - Many. - Yes, many. And his name is not Alex. Seth Villaraza. - Really? - Really? - Pendong Kulas! - Pendong Kulas! Sir, are you okay? Sir? I don't know which is more hurtful, the book you threw at me, or your insults. Well, l' m only telling the truth! Yes, that's true. But you have never been my girlfriend... so you have no right to kill me! Really? You haven't been his girlfriend? Put those down. Put those down. You look stupid. Is she really that rude? Oh no, Pia is a good girl. She's nice and sweet... sir Alex, Seth. Wait, what shall I call you? What is your real name? Seth Alexander. But people here prefer to call me Alex. Oh. - Nanny Josie, let's go. - Why? I' m not telling you to go. Seeing the turn of events... I think it would be best if nanny Josie and l... will just go and look for another hotel to stay in. Where will you go? - Just stay here. - Nanny. Let's just forget about what happened. It's peak season, you won't find a place to stay. No, thank you. Pia, it is an insult here in Greece to decline a kind of hospitality like this. Look Mr. Villaraza. It's enough torture that we are in a same country. I don't want to torture myself more and stay under one roof with you. Nanny! Let's go! - Suit yourself. - Nanny! Let's go! But I cannot leave her alone. - I'm her nanny. - Nanny! You are the real reason I came here. - Sweetheart, sweetheart. - Let's go look for another place to stay. - Cold? - Cold! - Let's go! - Does it look like l' m not following you? Hello Pia, how's your vacation? Did you find yourself a guy? Selene, do you know who the boss of the pen pal of nanny Josie is? It's Seth! Seth? Seth Alexander Villaraza, my ex? Your ex, Marianne's ex, Carmen's ex, Billie's ex, everyone's ex! Seth! Is he still cute? Oh my god, Selene! He's still conceited, still vain, still so self- important! Pi, he's not that bad. Well, you're in a romantic place with him... - so we' ll never know. - Oh no no no! I don't even know why l' m here in Santorini. And I swear, in front of this wall with the same color of my scar... that all the foolishness that happened to all of you will not happen to me. Just enjoy. You know what, l' ll call you later. - l' m not in the mood. - Okay. - Let's go! Hurry up! - Are you satisfied nanny Josie? Are you? Come on. Sir Alex... can we just stay here again? I told you so. Sure. In one condition, though. I want to hear Pia say " please". Pia, let go of your pride. Say " please". I'm so tired and it's so cold. I'm starting to feel like an ice drop. Please, please! Please? Is it okay if we stay here in your place? Hihihi. Okay? What's this? You have a lot of nerves, huh? Why did you just do that? Because I've already mastered your playboy style! Style? What style? That! You' ll approach the girl you like... you' ll stand on her left, then you' ll talk to her for a bit... flirt with her a bit and then what? What's next? You' ll hold her hand... and in just a short while you already have her fooled... she's already your girlfriend without courting her. - Wow! How did you know that? - There. I don't remember dating you. Date me? Huh, you wish! Okay, so how did you become an expert on my style? How do I know? - You want? - No, thank you. Because you've been everybody's boyfriend... - Seth. - Everybody but you! - So that's why you're so mad, huh? - Excuse me! Tell me, what do you really get out of breaking the hearts of all those girls, huh? What are you saying? I hate break ups. It's not a good feeling when you know you've broken a girl's feelings. Then don't hurt them! Seth, it's that simple. You know you don't even stay long enough in a relationship to make it work. - Aha! That's why I didn't court you! - It's not just about feelings. 'Cause you're no fun, Pia! You' re no fun! Like I said, I never ever dreamt of being your girlfriend! Huh! Deny deny deny deny. - You' re so conceited. So so conceited! - It's okay. You know what... - You don't have to deny it. - I cannot handle your vanity! You are so bigheaded! So vain! Here, eat this bread, fresh from the oven! Lord, we want to thank you... for the peaceful day you have given us here in Santorini. We are so very happy that Seth and Pia are very nice to each other! Come, let's eat. No one is fighting, thank you Lord... - thank you! - Amen. Brother, what's wrong? Wrong? Nothing. I'm just checking on you and Josie. How is her pen pal? Is he a good man? I thought something's wrong. Yes, he is okay. I' m going to definitely look. Franco, it's just a few hours time difference... why does it feel like l' m still the one doing your schedule and your job... instead of planning my own schedule here. Just accomplish that and then call me later... within 10 to 20 minutes, okay? Okay bye- bye. Thank you. Why are you here? You' re going to love the coffee here. You really don't like me, huh? Ahuh! Don't worry, before you go home, you' ll like me. Dream on! Aren't you going home? What are you doing here? Nothing. Aren't you going to open the taverna today? No, I've no plans of opening the restaurant today. Plus, I don't really need to earn anything yet. You, but how about your employees? Those guys will return when they need the money already. For the rest of the time, they can do whatever they want to do. Just like me. They can have a life. It's pointless that you volunteered to manage the taverna... if you don't really have plans of making it profitable. It's your responsibility to your employees and their families... to make the restaurant generate income. You know what... that's just like the article I read about you last night on the internet. Yeah! I did a bit of research about you last night. I even called my friends back in Manila and I asked about you. Sophia Carmina Sandoval. You didn't tell them I was staying in the same house as you, right? Right? No. I don't want people to gossip that l' m courting you. Bad. - Café? - Oh, thank you. Thank you! Huh? Paracalo. - What's that? - You' re welcome. Ahh. Para... paracalo. Wewe... - Ouch! Hot! - Zestos. - No, it' s so hot. - Yes, zestos. Hot... really hot. This coffee is hot. - My tongue got burned, see? - Sorry, sorry. Wait, l' ll get you ice. - Why did you not tell me that... - Sorry... - it's extremely hot, this coffee? - sorry. What's this? What are your plans here in Greece? Let me see... Plans while in Greece... return call to Gina regarding schedule... buy souvenirs, work on project, find a greek... talk to a greek, eat greek salad, stand up during flag ceremony... follow the rules, follow the straight line, die a virgin. Pia, have you ever tried living your life to the fullest without having a plan? Meaning if I've tried to live my life like you live yours? - Look, let me be your vacation. - l' m sorry! - Just go along with whatever I say. - Not that l' m being rude or anything... - no rules, no questions asked. - but you might get offended... but I do not want to go with you. - ... just an adventure for today. - Why are you doing this? If you go along with whatever I want to do today... What do you get out of this? For the next 24 hours. I promise you... - You will not see me again. - So what? I will not even sleep in the taverna for us not to see each other. You will not hear my voice, you will not see me... you will not even smell me even when you want to. I have an idea. Let me borrow your pen. - Stop it. - Wait... I, Seth Alexander Villaraza will not court... or even be seen by Sophia Carmina Sandoval... here in Greece, of legal age, signed by Seth V. Just put your signature there and it's a done deal. All right. If that's what you want. Sophia Carmina Sandoval. So where are we going? So you came here in Greece just to accompany nanny Josie? No, it's a birthday gift from my brother. It's your birthday? Last March. It's June already. Why just now? Nothing. Too busy working. Actually, I have more work now... but my flight ticket is about to expire so I have no choice but to go. What? Are you waiting to get cancer before you go on a vacation? I guess so. That's where the sun will set! We are here on Amuri beach. Here, let me take a picture of you. - It's okay. Really. - Come on. - You' re here in Santorini. - l' ll hold on to this. No... smile! That's okay. Can I see? One more. This is where the most beautiful sunset... - happens in Greece. - There? You see that? Later, it's going to be filled with people watching the sunset. - There? - After the sun sets... - everyone cheers. - Ahh! - Wooh! That's my girl. - You jerk! Belated happy birthday. Thank you! You know, she was an addict. - Yes, that's why she went to rehab. - You are so fake. You' re fake. - You' re lying. Tell the truth! - No! - It's true! - Lie. In fairness, your drawing looks awful! Ouchhh! My stomach hurts. Okay, okay, let's go. Ouch! Ouch! Wait wait. One more round. Sorry. Change first. This is pretty. Why not wear it? That looks really, really delicious. That's olive oil. You make good olive oil. It really looks quite delicious. You' re more delicious. Really? Benjo. Your boss? Wow Pia, you really have a way with timing. I cannot understand what he wrote here. Let me see. What can you not understand here? What can't you understand about this? What's written here is very clear. Wear this later... Seth. - He said wear it later. - And why? What' ll happen later? Don't know. Does it look like I know? Sir Alex told me we' re attending a party later and we should get dressed. I don't want to dress up. Might be just drinking on a street corner. Impossible! There are no street corners here! No street boys! I hate it... Where are we? Please slice these. I' m crying now. - What is this? Take it easy. - Sorry! Sorry! We might reach the place quickly but we end up dead. Are we there yet? - Who is this girl, anyway? - My former girlfriend. - How dare you! - Ouch - Then why are we going to her?! - Ouch! Ouch! One moment! One moment! Is this the place? This is a festive party! Nanny... just a second. Wait. Excited. And we are dressed just like this? - What then? - We' re not properly dressed. It's embarrassing. Behave. Behave. Why are they breaking the plates? - Do not worry, that's normal here. - They are wasting the plates! - Those plates are not wasted! - Someone is breaking plates, wasting them. They are drunk. Pia! Hey why did you not let me know? We could have dressed properly. Why did you not wear the dress that I asked you to use? We are not dressed properly. When Benjo said the party is on a hillside, we thought it as informal. A barbecue or camping. Pia, next time trust me, okay? Huh? The last time I trusted you my tummy went very bad. - Sorry about that. Okay then? - Nanny... - Let's go. It's okay. - Are you sure it is okay... - how we are dressed up? - It's okay. Let us have fun. Alright. Ok, let us have a shot. - A shot of Uzo. - Shot? - Pia.. Pia. Look. - Shot shot shot. This is good. Oppa! Now what? Are you game? This is fun! Wait, wait Pia. Wait Pia, come. You have to do this. It's tradition. Try to do this. Watch! Oppa! - Go ahead, Pia, try it. - Go Pia. Go, go. - What's wrong with you? - Go, go! Oppa! - Does it feel good? - Yes! - Once more, go. - Ok, go. - You know what? I admire you. - Why? It usually takes 3 months for a girl to fart in front of me. And by that time, she should already be my girl. But with you, woohoo! - Hahaha. - You' re different. Cheers to you. Cheers to you. - They' re sweet, aren't they? - They' re sweet, aren't they? - Pendong kulas! - Pendong kulas! - Pendong kulas! - Pendong kulas! - That's enough! - That's enough! - Pendong kulas! - Pendong kulas! - You suck! - You suck! - Pendong kulas! - Pendong kulas! That's enough! Pia, for you to skip your birthday for a business meeting... is a perfect sign to resign. And besides, you don't even enjoy your job anymore so what's the point, right? I am enjoying it. I am enjoying my work, okay? The only problem is when it becomes stressful. That's because aside from being employed... I also happen to be the daughter of my boss. You know how that feels? The expectations they have on you are so great. That is why I will never work for my father. You can afford to do that, I cannot. You can do it, too. You are just scared. But it's okay. That's why you need a man. You know! It's okay to be scared. As long as you are not a prodigal child. I have done that before, and I do not want to do it again. Oppa! So explain it to me. Aren't your family's riches ill- gotten wealth? Let us call my father to find out. Hey... hey hey hey hey! - Hey do not do that! - Pia. Chill, okay? - Hey, your father might get angry. - Hello, Dad. Dad! Sorry to wake you up but we have a question for you. Is it true that our riches are ill- gotten wealth? Yes, they came from your grandfather. What made you call this late in the night? Sorry, Dad. I just need to know. - Ok. Is that all? - No, I still have one question. What is it? Do it quick. Are you and Mom still having sex? - Hey! Hahaha. - Of course! We just had one. - Whoa! Hahaha! - Sure! Oh! Are you really going to stay in Santorini? Ooops! Sorry sorry sorry. It is depressing in Manila. My family has problems. Do you know? My siblings are all single parents. They were all left behind or separated from their partners. Will not my nieces and nephews go crazy when they grow up? All the more that they need you to go back. I guess so but l' m not yet ready to face my sister Abby. She might be right. She may be out of her mind when she blames me for what happened to her. If only I had not been a naughty child... my parents could have given my siblings enough attention. And they could have helped them. Haven't they? But life is like that. Are you then resigning? How about you? Will you run the taverna well? Can you now tell me why you are so mad at me? Can you now tell me why you have hurt all my friends? Oh! They were only your friends, not you. - Why should you care? - Hey, we met before. We bumped into each other like this. Then... you embarrassed me in front of everyone. - I am not like that. - Heey! My body will have another scar. Where did you really get this scar? This one here. This? This is why I cannot and do not want to resign. - That came from your father? - No. A car accident caused it when I was 18. I was so madly in love with my first boyfriend. I deeply loved him. His name is Diego. But my father disapproved of him. He said he's a cheater and will only hurt me. He is a womanizer with many other girlfriends I am not aware of. He is a bad influence to me. With no direction in life. He is a rocker that's why. God, I thought love would conquer all! You know what I did? When Dad told me to go to Europe and sent me away to stay there... He sent me away. - Diego and I eloped. - What?! - You eloped? - Diego and I eloped. Whoa! There. I really thought we will be okay but... we had a car accident. I stayed one week in the hospital. Dad was very mad. He prevented me from seeing and speaking to Diego who was also in the hospital. But of course I fought for it. I still went out of my way to see him. I went to the hospital. I did not know that Diego and his ex- girlfriend got back together. He broke up with me because he found our relationship too complicated. That's it. He simply gave up. It was so easy for him. Just that simple and easy for him. He said he is suffering a lot. I deeply hurt Dad. And everytime I see him, I feel like a very bad child. As if I have so many mistakes that I have to pay for. Why? Why? Nothing. All along I thought I was talking to an angel. I never thought you also have horns. They are gone now. It will not grow anymore. I cut them off. Why did you cut them off? Who knows you may look better with them. - What? - A little horn. Kiss me. What? What did I do to you? You stole a kiss from me. Fool. I can return it to you. Did you use magic on your scar? Why does it looks like it's gone now? No, I just hide it. Spray. Why do you hide it? That may be your best feature. Villaraza, it is too early. I am not yet ready to exchange insults with you. It is true. That is the best thing about you. You get hurt, you snore, you fart... - your tummy goes bad. - I got it. I am not perfect. No you're not. You' re human. What would you say if I ask you if I can court you? Whatever happened to our contract? Pia... Seth, I only came here for a vacation. I am leaving in a few days. I know. You won't like me once you get to know me. And my life is in Manila. While yours is where life drifts you. Wherever you wish. Senseless, isn't it? Yes, yes. It will be a mistake for you to date me. I am the worst guy you could possibly date. Yes! But I'd still like to try. If you would allow me to court you... then meet me at the caldera tonight at 8pm. That is if it's okay with you. No pressure. You' re open? Yes, actually, we are all shocked that Sir Alex told us to open the taverna. So my plan to go to the nude beach with Josie is cancelled. Mixed salad coming up! Benjo hurry up and help me here. Stavros! - Hello! Selene. - Pia! Have you killed Seth? Worse! I think I killed my irritation towards him. Oh my god! - Does it mean you are falling for him? - I guess so. But I don't want to love him. I know he's just going to hurt me in the same way that he hurt all of you. You know Alex. People like us have to live by our own rules. But, if you fall in love and let her into your heart. Then, you' ll have to live by her rules. You have to give up control over your life for her. Love changes people too much. Until there is nothing left of the person you used to be. So why are you calling me? I think you already know what to do. But it is wrong, isn't it? It' s wrong to love him, right? Dad won't like him anyway, right? Actually, you have a point. - But... - This is foolishness, right? You know Pia, you shouldn't ask about obvious stuff. Okay? Okay. What if you don't like yourself in the first place? Maybe love is a good kind of change. Huh! What's not to like? She will try to change you when she should just accept you for who you are. First, it's the little things. Your peer, your clothes, your friends. Then she tells you that it's still not enough. I tell you Alex. There is no freedom in love. Your house is very pretty, guys! Ahhh, Pi... Oh my gosh. Congratulations! I am so glad you're here. I am glad you got here. - Of course. Just for you. - We miss you so much. - Your house is really pretty! - Oh, picture picture. 1, 2, 3. Congratulations. That is right. It is good that you could come. We thought you' ll bury yourself up again in the office. Of course not. It's a Saturday. Since when did it stop you? You know what, we can give Pia a tour of our house. - Pia, this is our house. - Hey, I will join you. Hey, where shall I put this down? Just place it there. - How beautiful! - How are you now? - It's okay. - You still do not have anybody in tow? If she has hardly have time for us her friends... how much more for her partner? I can show you the master's bedroom. This is the master's bedroom. It is small but we really worked on the design of this room. Only now did I realize that the color orange suits you well. Orange! You know, speaking of love life. I saw Tristan Von Aufenberg. Did he not court you? Oh my god, Pi! Tristan's back. Why don't you give him a call? To know if he is still available and interested in you. And maybe go out on a date? Actually my Dad hired him as a consultant for my next project. - Really? - Oh my god, Pi! That's perfect. Go go go! We planned to increase newspapers and magazine ads by 25%. This is more expensive but has a wider reach than our brochures. And hopefully by the end of the year... the sales of Triant Towers can catch up with the competition. So... what do you think, Tristan? Ah... sorry Pia. But I have to disagree with you on this one. Now, you might be more successful if your marketing strategy is experiential. So, you need to think of new ways to show... and lead your clients to the condotel. Then to our model units at Triant Towers. I agree with you! Everyone, thank you. Thank you very much. Tristan, thank you. You may all leave now, please. Except for you Sophia. Hello, Mom. I am back. - What? - I am now here in the Philippines. Since when? Why did you not let us know you are coming? Nobody is available to pick you up. We are all here in the office. Don't worry. I'll take care of myself. I'll see you soon. Sir Alex, everything is here. Thanks Benjo. By the way, we will check out a place later tonight. It was recommended to me by a friend. You have to join me so you will know what we will need. But sir, I am supposed to meet with Josie. You know... it's been three months and we terribly miss each other. Is that so? Sure. Take care. See you tomorrow then. Thank you, sir. I will just send you a message about her favorite flowers. I have assigned that project to you a long time ago. Months and months ago. But no progress has yet been made on the sales. We' re doing the interior designs of the model units. It was a surprise that Antonio Carlos dropped the project and then... So who did you choose to replace him? Rhina is trying to get him back. But he is really hard to get... Sophia, do not give me these excuses. You' re there so you can do the work... in finding clients and entice them to buy the units whatever it takes. Do you know what my plan is? Next year, you will be in- charge of all our real estate operations. But you need to do a good job. Tristan, I believe in that boy. I trust him. He knows what he's talking about. And you Sophia. You really need to work twice as hard to prove to everyone... that you deserve the promotion that I'm giving you. Pia... Tristan, you need anything? Look. Why don't we have dinner in Galileo? I need to pass on that. I knew it. I was expecting you to say that. But you know what? Honestly. It was easier to court you when we were 1 5 years old. When your Dad forbade anyone to court you. What changed? A lot. But white roses are still your favorite, right? That one will never change. If I give you white roses... will that change your mind and agree to have dinner with me? We' ll see. Okay. We' ll see. I cannot go with you to the food tasting tomorrow... Dianne has an OB appointment. Can we do it next week? Bro, you have to be there. Can't you be there? It's next week. What's wrong? What? Nothing's wrong. - Why are you sad again? - Excuse us. Good afternoon. Ms. Pia Sandoval? That's me. Delivery ma'am. Is this flower arrangement for Dad's birthday party? I' m not sure. Pia... Hope you could give me another chance. Can I have dinner with you tonight? This doesn't have name. Who sent this? - That is from Tristan. - Tristan. Hey, hey... hey! Maybe with that great number of flowers... you will now let him take you out on a date. Good evening ma'am. Hello. I' m here for a dinner. Good evening ma'am. Table for? Ah, l' m with someone. This way. Thank you. Pia... Hey! What the hell are you doing here? To have dinner with you. How can you think of me wanting to have dinner with you? I was going to give you more flowers but... Flowers... So you sent those flowers? Yes. Had I known the flowers came from you, I could have rejected them. Pia! Pia! Can we talk about this? Pia wait. Seth, you know what? Just go back to Santorini and stay there. Can I explain myself? No Seth, there's nothing to explain. - Pia, l' m sorry. - Seth! But... - You are the reason that I left... - Seth, talk more and... - and why I am here now. - I swear l' m going to hurt you. Hurt me all you want, Pia. It's okay. Pia l' m sorry! Seth, you know what you need? You need to really look like you are sorry before I talk to you again. Pia. Hey, Uncle Seth is here. Uncle Seth, Uncle Seth! Oh, there's Uncle Seth. Hey, hey. You have grown up. How are you? Move on guys. You are bothering Uncle Seth. Go play over there. Move on. Beer? - Look. - Hello! - Dad. - Son. It is good that you are now home. It's good that you made the decision to join us for dessert. Oh, what's with the shoe? Nanny, he is wet. Why? Were you jilted? That's a first! Who is this girl? But you know what? If not for her... maybe you will only come home to Manila in a coffin. Introduce her to me and your mom. So that we can thank her. Pa... How can Seth introduce her when he has been jilted. Jilted. Oh Seth. Do not suddenly leave us again. I am about to have you meet my fiancée. Sorry we're late. Hi... - Grandma! - Oh, hi baby! Hi grandma. Hi grandpa. - Hi Aunt lssa. - Hi Mom. Hi Dad. Where's my hug? Hi Uncle Mike. Seth. You are here? Why eat dinner only now? He was jilted that's why. Really? Well l' m sorry to hear that. But that's a first. Well I hope... you will not leave again just because of that girl. I don't think so. I think l' m staying this time. I miss all of you. That's good Seth. This house is empty without you. Empty? With all of you around? I missed you babe. I miss you. Pi... It's good you are here. - Ashley, happy birthday! - Ashley, here's Aunt Pia. Here's my gift for you. - Thank you Aunt Pia. - You' re welcome. Can I have a kiss? Hi Dad! My grandchild is really cute. Smells so good. Hi. How are you Ashley? Are you happy? - Yes. - l' ll sit here. Happy birthday to you! Yehey! Wow... If your grandma was alive. I am sure she will be happy with you. Gino is that already 150? Make sure this is 150. - Sure. Just do it very well. - Ah, this Buddha head ma'am? That Buddha can be attended to later, Franco. - Let's do this one first. - Okay ma'am. Ma'am Pia, is that your friend? Ma'am Pia, you know him? Ah, Franco please put that there. Its nice colors will shine when the sun strikes it. The orange color also fits well... You mean the lamp? Wait. Get that lamp and put it in the storage area. Because there's no place for this here. Pia. - Pia, can we talk for a while? - Ma'am, you know him? - Franco, can you get me some water please? - She knows me. I will plug this lamp near the reception. - Pia... - Please plug it in. - Is there any outlet there? - Ma'am, are you sure... - this should be placed here? - Pia, can we talk? - Franco, can you please plug this in? - Yes ma'am. - Is there a lamp that... - Pia, please talk to me. doesn't have light?! Pia, Pia please! Please! Do not intervene. - We will just talk. - Stop it. Put me down. Stop it. - It will only take a while, huh! - You are embarrassing me. Ouch! Seth. Don't worry. Pia? Pia? Don't worry. We will just talk, okay? This is important. Do not make a call. Please! Please. Where is he taking her? - I don't know. - I think something is going on. - Can you go to where Pia is? - Not me. I am glad we can take a break. Seth Villaraza, is that you? Seth! I am tired of being pestered. I don't want to see you. I don't want to talk to you. I have nothing more to say to you. Pia, Pia! After we've done talking and you do not want to see me anymore... you will no longer see me for the rest of your life. I have a contract here. This will prove it. And this time... I asked a lawyer to draft this. You will go back to Santorini? And stay there. And you will not come back to the Philippines? Fine! Then what's your point?! I have important things to do. I met Stavros that night. He was miserable that night... like everybody I know who gambled on love and lost. Pia! I will not leave. Tell your pampering friend, I will exploit his bar. You know what? Stavros is right. When you love someone, you don't belong to yourself anymore. Love will just tire you down until nothing is left of you. But that is okay. That's okay if the one you love will love you back until the end. But we do not have an assurance, do we? Even the good men... and those who behave well, like my brother Mike... my sisters Abby and lssa- they were abandoned. How could that not happen to me? So when you thought of us... you were convinced that I will leave you. If we become lovers... you want me to change according to your standards. Mr. Perfect. I' m never going to be that, Pia. Because I cannot do it. Were you not the one who reminded me that I am human? Not perfect. So why will I look for someone perfect? Who knows I am only looking for Mr. Right. I cannot do that too. At the start while we were still strangers... I was already Mr. Wrong to you, wasn't l? Did I not hurt your friends? Bullshit! All you are saying is bullshit. And my body can only absorb a small amount of bullshit today. It's my turn. Tell me, honestly. If you got scared, and felt weak to move on... then why are you here? - Why did you come back to the Philippines? - Because I am a fool. I am a fool Pia. Do you understand? When I did not show up, my life flashed ahead in my brain. Everything that can happen. All the pains that I can feel. - If eventually it will be us. - Why are you here? I was so afraid of being miserably in love with you. - Why are you here, Seth? - But I realized... that it's more painful to be miserably in love without you. - Why can't you answer my question? - Give me another chance please. You had a chance and you blew it. - Pia, please! - No! I' m sorry! Thank you! - Sir, we' ll miss you! - Thanks. We'll wait for that, sir. Ma'am Pia... Oh, it's your new boss. It's your new boss. I thought you said until later this month? Pia, I didn't expect it too. You know Dad. - But... - Why? Are you not happy for me? Of course l' m happy. But you're the only one I have. Don't worry. I believe in you. Everybody here believes you. I need you here. Explain this. Who is this Seth? What is his relation with lsidro Villaraza? One of the most corrupt vice- presidents in history. Explain this! That's nothing, Dad. It's not what it looks like. It's just a guy that I met in Santorini. And he courted me but it's nothing. What is this? Another Diego Ocampo? Have you not been burned? Have you never learned? Now that our real estate business relies on you. Sophia, don't you have any respect left for yourself? Dad! Take it easy. I think she gets the point. I don't think she gets the point at all, Gregory! If she understands what she is doing... she will not have any relation with this guy! Did she not just tell you? Seth courted her but she jilted him, that's it! Why do you have to believe everything that the news says... about her than your own daughter. Are you telling me that all of this was made up? All our employees saw it... which she did not deny! She said it's over, right? She said the same thing 6 years ago! We both thought it was over. But what happened at the hospital? We found out that she's still into Diego. Dad. That was six years ago. And you. How can you manage this business... when you can't even manage yourself? Get out of my face! Get out! God damn! Calispera. - May I have your name? - Selene. Selene... Selene Mercado, Manahan, Chua or Lopez? Chua. There are other Selene? Yeah! Hey Selene! You know each other? - Of course, we' re friends. - Who was first? - Ahm... me! - Me! - Selene, what are you saying... - Well anyway, you are not the last. - You are... - Marianne. - Sir Alex... - Have you informed Pia? - Sir, your former girlfriends... - Not yet. How about you? - Hi, Seth. - Hi. - Hi, Carmen. - How are you? Where's Billie? She's in the States now. She won't be here. But she said she will talk to you when she comes back. - Of course. Selene... Manahan... - Mercado. Hello! Piyaya? Marianne! Where are you guys now? Piyaya, are you okay? I feel like everything I do is wrong and my life is a total mix- up. Huh? Why? - Where are you? - Where are you? Where are you? I' ll go and see you. No, we' ll be the one to meet you up. Where are you now? I' m on the road now. Where are you? I need to talk. Ah. We are here in a new greek restaurant... Sophia's Mediterranean Deli... - near west gate Alabang. - Okay. I' m on my way. Thank you all for coming here tonight. Mom, thank you. Before all of these happened, I was asked many times by my friends... and the manager of this taverna, Benjo... if I am ready to face all the women I have hurt. Because for him, I might not be able to get out of here alive. But I told him that I need to say sorry to all of you whom I have hurt. I' m sorry. And I also want to say thank you. Thank you for loving me and making me a part of your life... eventhough I am not worthy of it. You loved me. Thank you. I went back to Manila to try to win back a girl. A girl that I have hurt very very much. I want to tell her... and I want to show her that I have changed. I'm not afraid to be hers. Even if right now... she's not mine because for her... I' m a big mistake. If only she knows. But because of you all, I have learned to really love her. Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers! Hey, Seth. I' m going to miss you! Stay in touch, okay? Sir. Pia. I am sorry if I have hurt you. Pia, sorry if you got dragged in my quest for true love. If I have hurt you, it may have become necessary to make me realize... that you are the one that I truly love. I love you, Pia. I love you very much. I love you! I love you. Benjo... Benjo. How are the lights? Have you fixed them? - You remember these? - Wait wait, I think I remember this. This is our table. For the big families. Just like this. I' ll take care of this. You know I worked hard for this. Yes, of course. A real shoe. Pia, whatever happens, never give this back to me. Is this it? Hello! - Hello, Pia? Are you okay? - Tristan, what made you call? Well, Franco said you were not answering his calls. So I guess l' m lucky that you answered my call. Are you coming in today? No, because it's my personal day off today. Do you want to talk about it over dinner tonight? Ah tonight? Pia, would it be okay if I put this in the office? Ah okay. - Yes, 8pm in Galileo. - Ah, okay. Sure. - Okay. Bye. - Okay, bye. - Who is that? - That's Tristan. Our marketing consultant. - Are you meeting tonight? - We will talk about... Dad's birthday celebration. Can I go with you? I might be able to help. - Sure. Are you driving me there? - Where? If Sophia arrives here or tries to contact you... - please let me know right away. - Yes, sir! Sir, Dara told me you wanted to see me. Have you talked to Sophia? I need to talk to my daughter, Tristan. Is it true that your Dad's birthday is a big celebration? Yes, it's an annual tradition. For his employees, for the clients, and for the company. That's good. - Hello! - Hello, Pia! Tristan. - Are you on your way? - Yes, l' m on my way! - l' ll be there in 20 minutes, okay. - Pia, I have to tell you something. What? I shouldn't but I think you have to know. What? - Your Dad is joining us for dinner. - What?! Pia, I'm sorry I cannot turn him down. Why? Would there be any problem? - Tristan, l' m with Seth. - Seth? - My boyfriend. - What?! Pia, what is the problem? - Dad is going to the dinner. - Pia? Pia what's wrong! What? The patient sustained multiple abrasions... Iacerated wounds and contusion hematoma. But don't worry, he will be fine. Boss, can we do this later? Thank you! Is he okay? Sophia. Sophia! Dad! - Are you okay? - Yes, we are okay. I mean I am okay. Only the one we hit on the road was hurt. - Sir, it was my fault. - Dad... Sir, I am Seth Villaraza. - Dad, it was his... - Your boyfriend? Yesterday you said he is not your boyfriend. I was not lying then Dad. You fix your own problems. I' m not helping you again. Dad... - Pia... - please. - Mr. Villaraza... - Dad! we need your statement about the accident that happened. Dad, please let me explain first. Dad, I love Seth. And I thought it was a mistake to be with him but that is not true. Please do not compare him with Diego. Dad, l' m sorry. I am fed up with your apologies, Sophia. Now I am certain that you are not even sure of what you are saying. Because if you truly are sorry... you'd stop saying it. And just stop disappointing me over and over again. Sorry Dad, if I am a big disappointment. I made a mistake six years ago. Six years! But you've looked at me Dad and never really seen me. Six years that all you see are my mistakes and not me as your daughter. Six years that you haven't really loved me. Because I fell in love with a wrong guy? I am really tired, Dad... for trying to be perfect. Dad, I will somehow make a mistake. And when it happens, I hope you can accept that I am not perfect. I try not to make a mistake... just for you to love me again. But if I make a mistake, forgive me for I am just human. If the man I am loving now is not acceptable to you... will you still accept me? Dad, will you still accept me? Did you not tell us you are through? Then why are you together? - Sorry, brother! - Just go home! Okay, brother. I' m sorry. Pia, you have to go home. No Seth, I cannot yet go home. Before I go home, I need to resign. I cannot bear anymore the daily sight of Dad. And then all he wants to do is to make me feel like l' m a complete shit. Don't resign, Pia. - No, I have to resign. - Go home. You have to go home. To your Dad. To your brother. Go home. Just leave me behind. Are you saying what I think you're saying? Pia. I have to say goodbye. No. Pia. You are the perfect girl. Am I not just the right one for you? No. I' m not the right one for you. It is not enough that I have changed. It is not enough that we love each other. That is not enough. I know how much you value your father. I know well that you love him very much. Pia, make it up to your family. Do fix things up with them, okay? Seth. No! Dad, l' m sorry. No. I am sorry. I' m so sorry, Pia. I missed it when you call me that. I love you. I love you Pi... Kids, come on. Let's go. You are not allowed to leave. We are here when you need someone to care. Of course not. Let's stand up, everybody! Our picture will be taken. Okay, let us all squeeze in. Smile. What about you, Seth? When will you bring someone to our family picture? Of course I have a proxy here. This is Pia, see. I' ll smile! - Cheers! - Hello, sir. - You tricked me. You got here quickly. - Thank you, nanny Josie. - There they are Dad. - Ah there? - Cheers! - Oppa! Go ahead! Ah hello. I am Pia. Sophia Carmina Sandoval. Seth's ex- girlfriend. I came here to tell you that I love your son very much. I love your brother. And kids, I love your uncle. I will not leave him behind. I' m staying and l' m not going anywhere. I' m not leaving your Seth. And whatever may happen, may it be pain or pleasure... I want to experience everything with him. I want to experience everything together with him. That is how much I love him. That's all. I thank you! Son. What are you waiting for? As if you are not a Villaraza! - Cheers! - I love you. Cheers! I love you too. Does your father knows? Hey! I forgot that they are here. Mr. Santiago Sandoval. Dad, this is Seth. - Sir. - Hello. Hello. I' m Santi Sandoval... I' m Greg. We are not yet asking for your son's hand. They are just very supportive as a family. You can court my daughter. But I want you to do it at home. Is that a deal? Okay, sir. You' re okay, Seth. Let's take another picture. Let's gather together. Cheers!
