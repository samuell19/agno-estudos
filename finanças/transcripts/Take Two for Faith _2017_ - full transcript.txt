This is an exciting night. Faith Winters is about to exit. I know that you can't wait for the information, and we're almost gonna give it to you, but, my lips are sealed until you hear from Faith herself. So hang in there. Five, four, three, maybe two? (laughs) All right guys, all right guys, that's enough joking. But here. She's almost in here. (people cheering) - [Faith] Hey guys. Faith here. I'm gonna tell you a little story. I remember this night like it was yesterday. I mean, the cameras, the fans, the lights, the energy on stage. It was awesome. I mean to everybody else, I had it all. But, deep down, there was somethin' missin'. Lookin' back now I know that I just wasn't happy. - Miss Winters and I are working on our next tour now. We will announce dates, venues, as soon as we can. Thank you. (people chattering) Amazing show again tonight, Faith. - Oh, thanks Randy. - Would you like to meet two of your number one fans? - Well of course. - Well come on in ladies. (girls giggling) - Hey, now, I saw y'all in the hallway. - Hi. - Hey. - All Abigail talks about is meeting you one day. We both saw your speech at the National Girl's Ministry and, well, you're her hero. You're also my hero. - That's so sweet. Well, I don't have any pictures to sign for you, but, um, do you like daisies? - They're my favorite. - They're mine, too. You know what's really cool about daisies? - What? - They look like they're one flower but they're actually two. - Thank you. We should probably get back going though. Our mom is waiting for us in the car. - Oh, then you better get goin'. You know what I learned when I was out on the road? - What? - You'll always need your momma. - Bye. - Bye. - Thank you. - Thank you, Miss Winters. - Bye. - Oh my god, we got to meet her. - Well. You did it. Another one in the books. - Hey now Randy, we did it. I'm gonna get my street clothes on and gonna go hang with some friends, so, I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

Well, you know my usual. - Yeah, Jack and coke, I got you buddy. - I appreciate it, man. Howdy ma'am. (people laughing) - Hey. - [Jay] Do I know you? - That's the line you're gonna use? - Well I aint lyin'. You look, you look familiar. - I don't know what to tell ya. - Hey, Vanessa is gonna kill me, and if she doesn't, Faith will. Wherever you are, Cam, just get here, like now. - You come in here a lot? - Man you're really pullin' out all the classics tonight aint ya? What's next? "Did you fall from Heaven?" (Jay laughs) - I don't know. If I'd of known that one, I'd have used that one, but you look like you could've fallen from Heaven. Are you just an open mic addict like myself? You know, I got a record coming out. - Oh, I heard. - Just trying to be nice. - Guys like you are never just trying to be nice. - You don't know the first thing about me. (hitting) - Everything okay here? - I'm good. But your little old friend there, she aint being very nice. - Come on Faith, let's go. - Faith? Faith Winters. (Faith gasps) (people laugh) Faith Winters everybody. - Faith what is going on? Get her out of here. Put all the cameras down. You'll be buyin' new ones if you don't. - What the? What's this? - Your little episode last night? All over the tabloids this mornin'. - Who cares? I didn't do anything wrong. Man, I'm just tired, Vanessa. These 14 hour days are killin' me. Please promise me you'll work in some off days on this next tour. - Yeah, I'll just work 'em in, I'll just pencil 'em in. What about me? - I don't know, hazard pay? (Vanessa groans) - Yeah. That's just print. Please don't turn on the TV, it's even worse in motion. But don't worry. I'll handle it. - Handle what, V? I'm tellin' you, it was not that bad. - Yeah, I'm sure it wasn't so bad. Okay, now listen. You know that high school you have a lot of money to? They're namin' an auditorium after you. So I need you to shower, get dressed, and paint the barn. - That's today? - That's today. Limo, red carpet, abbreviated set pictures with kids, back in the car, home, and to bed. Knock wood. - It's gonna be fine. - Paint the barn. Just because you throw it away doesn't make it go away. (soft country music) (phone pings) - Hey baby. How you feelin'? - I'm fine. - Come here and take a load off. - Look last night didn't end quite the way I had hoped, and this morning hasn't been much better. But I got it all under control. Stop stressin' me. - Okay. - What are you watchin'> - Our very own sweet, Southern, spiritual songstress from Smithville is spiraling seriously out of control. By now you know, it's none other than Faith Winters. Mhm. - Are you? Are you kiddin' me> - Listen, listen, listen... - What? - Listen, listen, listen. I knew that was gonna be your reaction. I knew that was gonna be your reaction and baby, take a deep breath. It's all good. It's actually a good thing for us. - Mm mm. - I spoke to somebody this morning. Remember Seth Ingram> - At Clearwater> - That's right, Clearwater Records. (chuckles) - Yeah, he's a known slimeball. - Okay, no, what he's known as, is head of the hottest record label in town. - Yeah, but how many bodies did he have to step over in order to get there> - Okay, just listen to me. I know you have an opinion about him, but throw that away and hear me out. He's got a great idea. We can use this publicity to our advantage, baby. Think about what's going on recently in the industry. Nashville is full of good girls, up and down the block, that are not making it. The fans are buying the bad girls right now. They want that crazy neighbor that will burn down the neighborhood, and sing about the flames. Sweetie, look at society. People are angry, they're frustrated, and they need somebody to be a voice of their frustrations. Faith, that can be you. - No, it aint gonna be me. Does Vanessa know about this? - Listen, I know you and Vanessa are good friends. And it's fine, but babe, I'm your manager. I've been doin' this a long time. And if we're gonna get over this hump, that we've been fightin' for the last couple years, you're gonna have to kick this goody two shoes act. - Act> - I know you're frustrated, but listen to me. Every career of every artist has chapters. This is your next one. Okay> Now go downstairs and make us some coffee. You finish gettin' ready. It's all good. (slow country music) (people chattering) (cameras clicking) - [Vanessa] Okay. Let's go over this one more time. - I like the cheese fries there. Someone might've slipped somethin' into my drink. The lesson here is, never let yourself become a victim. Now let's talk about why I'm really here. - Yes. That's it. Perfect. Okay you got that? - Got it. - Show time. Let's go. Hey. You got this. (people chattering) - [Soozie] Faith. - Hey y'all. - Hi. Soozie from IT TV, do you have a minute? - Yeah. - Awesome, so what really happened last night? - Well. I like the cheese fries there, and, uh... - So the cheese fries got you intoxicated? - Thank you, thank you so much. Thank you. - [Soozie] Listen Faith. - [Faith] Thank you. - [Soozie] Is it true that you knocked down a drink or two, Faith? - I know you called Ingram. - I did. - Okay, listen, you know, I know your fans will forgive if you just give us the truth. - Hey, I really like that blouse. Where'd you get that> - Listen. We can fix this, okay? Faith's one of the good guys. Look at where we are. We are at a high school auditorium with teenagers and their parents. - You listen to me. Our record sales are dropping. Last night is the first time that Faith's trended since her first album. Her first. I bought out everything I could to get this televised today. Now if all we do is simply repair her image, you and I will be in the unemployment line before the CMAs. - Cameron, this is more than just a job for me. I promised her daddy before he died that I would take care of her. - You are taking care of her. Bert didn't want her to starve. So do us both a favor and stay in your line. (soft country music) - Well aint you a sight, Pastor Gavin. - Am I? I wouldn't know. - Cute. - Hey, you seen Zoe today> - Said she was goin' to the dance studio. - You know, if I can get her to focus on her homework the way she focuses on her dancin', I might be considered for sainthood. (laughing) - Well, we all have our loves. - Vices, too. (country rock music) (clapping) - You've been practicing. - Miss Sharp. I didn't realize anyone was here. - Well I didn't wanna interrupt. Did you make up that dance all by yourself? - Yeah. - It's really impressive, Zoe. I see you're listenin' to Faith Winters. You a fan? - Yeah, she's all right. She's got a pretty voice. You> - Me? Oh, I'm a big fan. Not as big as your daddy though. - Why's that? - Wait, he hasn't told you> You know, why don't you, um, I think you should ask him about that. Yeah, I would love to hear what he has to say. - Okay. - Speaking of your daddy, um, I think he's looking for you. Why don't you get your stuff and we can head over to the church. I'd like to tell him good night. - Okay then. (laughs) - Any calls? - You sure you wanna know> - We behind again> (sighs) - Here. - I thought we were caught up with the electric company? - Uh, we were. In March. - All right. I'll take care of it this afternoon. Anything else? - Sarah Miller called. She wants to rent the fellowship hall on Thursday nights for a book club. - Rent? - Yeah. - She has fair use of that space just like everyone else, Amy. - Gavin. Now I know it's been a while since my comm degree did any real good, but I do remember a couple of things, and one of 'em's you need to have more money comin' in than goin' out if you wanna keep these doors open. And I haven't even started goin' through all the other bills. Now, if you want me to be quiet, I will. But sooner or later, we are going to have to start chargin' for use of the fellowship hall. - No. No, Amy, we're not gonna start chargin' our members to use this place, all right> It's theirs. - Then how do you suggest we pay the bills? Hm> - God'll provide. God'll provide. (sighs) - All right. - You just gotta have faith. - There she is. Hi, beautiful. - Hey. - You ready to celebrate> - Celebrate what? - How many people you know have a high school auditorium named after them, huh? So loosen up, let's have a drink. - Where's Vanessa? - I'm sure she'll turn up. But first, I wanna introduce you to Seth Ingram from Clearwater Records. - Faith Winters. It is a pleasure to finally meet you. I feel like our paths are always crossing, yet we never... - Somehow we never meet. - Exactly. - Funny how that works. - Well, the good news is, now there's no excuse. So why don't you two grab a drink and step outside and maybe have a talk? - We have something to talk about. Here you go. Listen, I wanna listen to your demos, honey. Come into my office and play it for me in person, will ya? Let's go this way. (country rock music) (deeply exhales) Pretty night. - Is that a question, or a statement? (chuckles) - One thing you learn about me is that I never ask questions that I don't already know the answer to. To the next megastar of country music. Oh come on now, Don, don't leave me hangin'. (clinking) To you. - Did you get your homework done? - Not yet. - Zoe. We talked about this. Miss Sharp is concerned. - With who? Me? Or you? - Just do your homework. - I will. - As soon as we get home. - I will. Dad! I am trying to send a text. - And I'm trying to have a conversation with you. - Gosh. ♪ My escape right now ♪ ♪ Light is comin', tunnel's endin' ♪ What do you know about her? Faith Winters? (tires screech) - Are you okay? - You know, you can just say "Pump the brakes" if you don't wanna talk about something. You don't actually have to pump them. (people chattering) - We dated in high school. So. Thanks, Miranda. - No problem, Pastor Gavin. So tell me, any life changing messages on tap for tomorrow's sermon? - You'll just have to show up and find out, I guess, huh? - Guess so, I'll be there. - Right. Your notebook's seen better days. What's in it? - My homework, dad. - All right. I'll stop pryin'. Where was I? - You dated Faith Winters. - Right. Back then, she wasn't Faith Winters. She was just Faith. - Did you love her? - The Lord commands we love everyone. - I'm not talking to Pastor Whitfield. I'm talking to my dad. - That was a long time ago. Speaking of time, I got a sermon to write tonight. What do you say we put our boots in the dust? Thank you. - Listen, Mr. Ingram, pardon my ignorance, but, um... - Ah ah ah, you see a mister around here? My name is Seth. - Seth. Well listen, I don't really want a whole lot out of life. I just wanna keep sharin' my music with the world, and hopefully touch a few lives. - What was that first part> - [Faith] Share my music. - With the what? - With the world. - With the world. You know what you just told me? You want the world. And if that's what you want, Faith, that is gonna cost you as an artist. Now that last record, I mean, it was, I mean sure, it was safe. Actually no, you know what> It was worse than that. It was ordinary, especially coming from someone who's got as much to give as you. And that is why I am offering you a deal at Clearwater. (chuckles) - Did Cameron put you up to this? - Would that make it easier for you to hear> If you knew that you had a traitor in the camp> - Well I have a record deal anyway, so, sorry. - See that's the thing, uh, I spoke with Robert tonight, and, uh, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but your label is dropping you tomorrow. - Wait, I'm sorry, what? - But the good news is, if you trust me, that means I'm in control, that means good bye to Vanessa, I can get you a proper publicist, I get you a good wardrobe, a new look, I even got a new single teed up for ya. You know, a lot of artists, they don't get second chances, and I don't need to tell you what to do with this one. It's all out there for you darlin'. Just take it. (slow, melancholy music) (door creaks) (quirky, suspenseful music) (clapping) - All right, ladies and gents. Zoe. - Hello. (chuckles) (acoustic guitar playing) ♪ Good friends are hard to find ♪ ♪ I'm lucky to have some ♪ ♪ We've shared the best of times ♪ - There you are. - Dad. - Surprised to see me here> You're not the only one, let's go. - Dad, wait, how did you even find me? - Even your dad has Facebook. - Whoa, 1600 likes already> That's insane. - Chad? Aren't you supposed to be at home, too> - Yes, sir. - See, let's go. Come on. - Dad. - Oh, hey, you did really good tonight. (slow, soft music) - We'll see you at church. (slow, soft music) Do you have any idea how dangerous it is to be out at this time of night? - It's not dangerous at all. We know almost everyone in there. - It's 11 o'clock, Zoe. Anyone can snatch you. - Dad. I'm not a little girl anymore. - [Gavin] Yes, you are. - No I'm not! - What are you doin' here anyway> - I want to perform. - You perform every Sunday. - I wanna perform outside of that bubble. - Well save it for Sundays. - So, bury my talent> - Performing at church is not burying your talent, okay> Hey. Look at me. Don't pull a stunt like that again, okay> (sighs) I know you probably saw this comin', but you're grounded. - [Zoe] Grounded? - Yes, grounded. You snuck out of the house in the middle of the night, Zoe. If there's ever an open and shut case for grounding, it's this one. (sighs) - Why are you always like this? - Because I'm your father. - No, you're just a giant cliche! I am not a baby. Why won't you just let me be who I am? - And who is that, huh> I mean, do you even know? - I miss mom. - Me, too. (slow, dramatic music) - Okay y'all, so I don't understand why I have to change my accent? I mean, this is the way I've talked my whole life. - Cameron, your manager, thought that if you really wanted to make yourself over, getting rid of your accent is an important step. - Okay, but I thought this new look was plenty different. - Your manager says your voice is going down one lane, meaning that there's a whole handful of fans who will understand you. You're a pop star now. We want to steer your speech to the entire road, to appeal to the masses, thus, stardom. Just got to put your voice box through a little bootcamp. You'll be fine. With me, your lips will be doing push ups, and your vocal chords will be doing 10-mile hikes. In other words, your mouth has just been drafted. - Okay. (claps) People, okay. This part is just for the stars. Thank you. Okay, I think I've got a good handle on what you want for the new album cover. So we get to work? - I guess. - Okay, let's do it. Oh you are beautiful. I like it, I like it. Yeah, beautiful. (Faith giggles) Oh my god, yes. Oh, you are so beautiful. Yeah, give me more smiling, more smiling. Yeah. Oh my goodness, yeah, I love it, I love it. Yes. Yes, it's your moment, it's your time, yeah. You are my queen today, eh? Yeah, perfect. Yeah, you are so beautiful. Yeah, more energy. Yeah, give me more, give me more. Yeah. I love it. - Woo. (giggles) - Oh my god. We have amazing photos. Do you like it? (giggles) - [Faith] What was I thinkin'> I don't even know how I could possibly have fallen for this. This isn't me. Thank you. Maybe I started changing a long time ago. Cameron, why are you not answerin' your phone? I mean, you were supposed to be here at this shoot, and it was a disaster. I'm not wearing this outfit, I'm not wearing this wig tonight at the show. I guess I'll see you backstage. (phone pings) Cameron, you left your phone in here. (country rock music) (phone pings) (country rock music) (slow, somber music) Okay. (slow, somber music) - Well hello everybody. Welcome to the world famous Wild Horse Saloon.

Ladies and gentlemen, would you please make welcome, Faith Winters. (audience applause) (slow, somber music) - Vanessa. Hey, will you just meet me at the house> - Faith, Faith, I don't blame you. - This is not what I wanted. I never wanted this. - I know, I know honey. Let me help you. I know. How, how long do you plan on being gone? - As long as it takes. - Faith, as long as it takes for what? To what> - Find my joy again. Can I ask you somethin'> And would you be honest with me? Please be honest with me. - Yes, yes, anything. - Cameron and Pia. - I'm sorry. - I knew it. Gosh, I knew it. I'm not gonna let them make a fool out of me. - Faith. - Take care of my place, would ya> And whenever Cameron shows up, throw that in his face. - You know what, Faith? I think I'm gonna enjoy this. Here. Listen to me. - I love you. - I love you, Faith. Now you listen to me. I want you to forget all about Cameron and Pia, and I mean, my gosh, I want you to forget about me, too. This isn't about us, this is about you. What do you wanna create next> And if runnin' aint the answer... - Then like a daisy, I'll grow.

What are you doin' here> - Hey Gavin. - Have you met my daughter, Zoe> - I don't believe I have. - You're Faith Winters. - Last I checked. - Zoe, will you give Faith and I a couple minutes> Please? Amy? - [Amy] Come on now. - All right, thanks. - I'm sure you'll get a chance to do more than stare soon. I'm sure you will too, darlin'. Come on, let's go. - Well that was a little more uncomfortable than I thought it'd be. I didn't realize so many people hated me. - No, they don't hate you. They just don't understand you. - Does that include you? - What are you doin' here> - I just, guess I just needed to get out of town for a bit. - Isn't that what you said when you left Smithville? - Sounds like me. So, um, I'm gonna be in town for at least a few days. You know how it is when you visit. Gotta make the rounds, but, um, maybe we can catch up. - You stayin' with your momma? - Yeah. I mean, I mean I think. She doesn't even know yet. - You haven't talked to her yet> - No, this is the first place I came. - Why? - Because it's Sunday mornin', pastor. Actually, I thought she'd be here. I'm kind of surprised she's not. - Yeah, I haven't seen her in a while. She's actually on my list for a home visit, so. Faith. Is everything all right? - Yeah. Just workin' on me. - Workin' on you. Well it's good to see you. - It's good to see you, too. - All right. (soft acoustic music) - Faith! You stole my car, you know! I should call the cops! (gun cocking) (scoffs) Well what are you gonna do Vanessa? Shoot me? - Well. Faith wouldn't. But I would. - Okay. Vanessa? - Cameron. - Look, all I wanna know is where's Faith at? - Well, let me see. Nope. I don't know. - You haven't seen her? - Nope. - Then let me guess. You're upset about what happened. - Oh, you mean about Seth firing me? - Oh Seth didn't fire you, sweetheart. I did. - Surprise, surprise. - I don't know what you think, but the only thing we've ever had in common is Faith. And once I started to see that you were driving a wedge between the two of us, something had to be done. - Yeah, well, I've been with Faith since the beginning. - Oh who cares> When I met Faith, she was nothing but a little girl with bad hair and stars in her eyes. And I built her into a brand. I'm the one who made her. - No, that's where you're wrong, Cameron. She made you. (chuckles) - Now let me guess. These same lights that she longed for suddenly became too bright. - I don't know where Faith is. I do know that she left that for you. And this for me. We all knew. Maybe that little ring looked better on Pia's finger. - This is going back on Faith's finger. You just watch. - I'll do that. (gunshot) (gun cocks) (gun shot) - Dang, that felt good. (gun cocks) - [Faith] Mom? - Faith? Faith? Honey, what are you doin' here? - What am I doin'> What are you doin'? - Oh, just blowin' off steam. Late night at the hospital last night. - Hospital? What are you doin' at the hospital? - I went back to work. I'm going crazy around here by myself. - When? - Oh a few months ago. Look at you. - Why didn't you tell me> - 'Cause I didn't want you to worry. Now come on, let's go inside and get you cleaned up. Sweet tea? - Oh, that'd be great. Sorry for just showin' up like this. - Honey, you never have to apologize for that kind of surprise now. I'm so happy to see ya. Now tell me everything. - You mean you hadn't heard what's been going on? - I have. Sometimes it gets hot in the spotlight and you gotta take a break. I understand. - Yeah, it wasn't nearly as bad as it looked. - Never is. So how long are you gonna stay? - I don't know. I just needed to get out of Nashville for a little while. You now I literally felt like I was losing control of myself. - Well those nails are different. (chuckles) - Yep. - You know, I went through a bad girl phase when I was on the road for a few months. - Nuh uh. I never saw any pictures. - 'Cause I burned 'em. (chuckles) When that part of my life was over, it was over. - Yeah, but do you ever miss it? - Hm, sometimes. - Now was that before or after dad? - Both, actually. That's when we met. I was going through that phase, poor thing. He probably thought I pulled a bait and switch on him. Turns out the bad girl he thought he was gettin' was a goody goody after all. (laughs) - And he didn't seem to mind. Always loved watchin' the two of you together. I still wish I could see those pictures, though. - So, uh, how's Cameron? - He's fine. - [Liz] What happened? - Just, stuff. Let's just say, we don't want the same things in life. - To be honest, I never liked him anyway. - Mom. - I told Wanda Templeton he was trouble the minute I laid eyes on him. - Well Wanda Templeton didn't seem to be too happy to see me this mornin'. - Where'd you see her> - At Movement. - You went to church this mornin'? - Yeah, I mean, I thought you'd be there. - You thought I'd be there? Or somebody else? - Don't read too much into it. I was just passin' through town. - Yeah, sure you were. - Seriously mom. Congregation looked awful thin. - I know. It's been bad for a while now, Faith. I don't know what the problem is. Poor Gavin's been working himself to death to try to get to the bottom of it. I'd be there if I wasn't workin' so much. - Do you need money? - No. Don't be silly. Honey, your dad's been gone for a while, but he's still taking great care of me. - I know. I just... Do you think Gavin needs money? - You came here to solve your problems. Not mine, not your ex-boyfriend's. You need to be sweepin' around your own porch before you go sweeping around everyone else's. Now tell me what the heck happened with Cameron. (soft acoustic music) - What does she do on that phone all day? - Lord knows. - Hey. So, Faith just shows up at church this morning? - Well yeah, if you were there, you would've seen her. - You know I had that Skype with Mike. So, let me guess. She arrives after the offering. Let me tell you somethin', I'm gonna go on the record and just say that 1/10th of her weekly income could keep your lights on, for a while. - Annie. - How'd she look? - You've seen her. - No, no, I've just seen her in those music videos. I don't know what kind of special effects they use. - She looks great. And she's still beautiful. - Oh no, not again. - What> - "She's still beautiful." No, I am serious, you are not gonna do that again. - Do what again? - You know. - No, I don't know. - Oh, okay, okay, let me reel it in and spell it out for you. You are not going to fall in love with Faith Winters again. - I know. - Do you? Yeah, you've got that same dumb look on your face you had when you first met her in 11th grade. - It's different. I'm different. And heck, I'm a father now. She's, she's way different. - Yeah. Way, way different. Way different, you remember that. Hey, Gavin. Janet's been, she's been gone for almost three years now. Don't you think it's time> - Time for what> To date> Date who> Jenny Sharp? - What's wrong with Jenny Sharp> - She's Zoe's teacher for starters. - Well there's always summer vacation? (scoffs) - We have nothin' in common. - Same church, same home town. - I don't think one of those things is an accident. - She's a good girl, Gavin, and she's pretty and she thinks the sun rises and sets in you. - Annie, I'm not interested in Jenny Sharp. - I don't really care. I don't care who you date or if you date. I just want you to be happy. And the last time that Faith Winters put a spell on you, I had to peel you off the pavement. - It wasn't that bad. - It was bad. You didn't eat for three days. - I was fasting. - You didn't shower for seven. Here. - I don't want it. - Have some, it's good. Did I ever steer you wrong, little brother? - So I walked out, drove all night, and here I am. - So you left Nashville to find your joy> Honey, when are you ever gonna find what you're lookin' for? (knocking) Well who in the world? - No, stay momma, I'll get it. Hey, Gavin. I'm glad you came by. - Yeah, is your mom home? - My mom? - Yeah, I told you she's on my list for home visits. I just was checkin' in. - Gavin. What are you doin' here> - You haven't been in Movement for a few weeks. Just wanted to check in, make sure you're all right, didn't need anything. - I'm fine. I picked up a few extra shifts at the hospital and, uh, as soon as I'm clear of that, I'll be back. - Yeah, well, Movement misses you. And the choir is not the same without you. - Well I miss it. I miss y'all. Look, I'm off on Thursday nights, so, maybe I could come back and help out with choir practice if that'd be okay? - Yeah, that'd be great. - Consider it done. And here I thought you'd come to find Faith. - Mom. - Don't tell me you didn't think the same. - I didn't. - Mhm. - All right, well you have a good day. - Gavin, hey. I know you gotta make your rounds, but, what do you say you just take a break for a bit and go with me> (sighs) - Go with you where, Faith> - It's crazy. - What's crazy? - Just the fact that it all looks just the same. It hasn't changed a bit. - It's exactly the way you left it. - The way I left it? - You know what I mean. Why are we at the high school> - Dang, it feels like I was down there cheerin' just like yesterday. - Time flies. - Do you remember the time that the student section collapsed and Benny Daniels got hung by that nail on his pants? (laughs) - I remember looking up from the sideline thinkin', "The band just got a whole lot smaller." You know at that point, I think I was 10 for 10, two touchdowns, game of my career, before the ref stopped play. If it wasn't for those bleachers and that wedgie, I might have a scholarship. - Yeah, but would you have taken it? - The scholarship> - Yeah, would you ever have left Smithville? - Of course I would. (scoffs) Why'd you bring me here, Faith? - I got somethin' to say, I just don't know how to say it. - Just open your mouth and speak. - Zoe's growing up. - Time does what it does. - Yeah, and what's that> - It ticks. Right now I'm trying to manage the wonder years. Being, I wonder how I'm ever gonna get through 'em. I mean, Zoe's a teenager in every sense of the word. Needs less of me and more of everything else. Games, friends. - Yeah, kids nowadays always textin'. - Facebook. - Snapchattin'. - What's Snapchattin'? (chuckling) Guess I am gettin' old, huh? - No, you're not. The world just moves at a different pace now. - You know when Janet and I took her in, we didn't really know what to expect. She was a kid in a shelter, a stranger, and neither of us had any idea how to raise a kid. I mean, heck. We were kids ourselves. But God told me to reach out my hand to that scared little girl. And when we got home that first day, she made me promise her that she'd never be alone again. If I hadn't made that promise, I might not be here today. - What do you mean> - When Janet got sick, I had some dark days. Questioning everything kind of dark, and it's like when I looked into the mirror, I didn't recognize the face staring back at me. - How'd you get out of that darkness? - Thankfully I had Zoe to keep me laughin' and Annie to keep me sane. - Yeah, but what if you hadn't of had them, then what would you have done? - What are you asking me, Faith? - Would you have called me? - I did try calling you but you were always too busy. Your people were more than glad to let me know that. - I'm sorry Gavin. - Why'd you bring me here> - Mom said things at church aren't going so well. - They're fine. - Listen, if you need me to float you some... - I'm sayin' no. I appreciate the offer. But God will provide, he always has. - But what if he led me home so that I can help? - What if you came home because you don't know how to be still? - Is that what you think? - I think you're afraid of letting go and letting God. - Yeah, and what's so wrong with that? - If the bird never let go, it wouldn't have learned to fly. - There's the pastor speak again. Can you talk to me in something other than a parable? - What do you want me to do, Faith? Be angry at you? - Yes. - Why? - Because then maybe I can stop being mad at myself for the both of us and just be mad for me. I may never forgive myself for not being there for you when Janet died. - You chose your life. Nobody begrudges you that. - Dang it, Gavin, stop giving me a pass and start making me accountable. - You knew what you were Faith. What good is that gonna do anyone now, huh> Look, if you want me to be angry at you, so that you can live with yourself, I'm sorry. I can't do that. - But you can forgive me. - Yep. I need to go check in at Annie's. Faith? Why did you bring me here? - Because I missed you, Gavin Whitfield. - Me, too. But the canyon between our lives is too great for a few words to fill. (slow, melancholy music) - All righty handsome. What'll it be> - I'll take a black coffee and a grilled cheese. - [Miranda] All right. - You have brie? - Brie? - Yeah. Cheese, for the sandwich. - Take a look around, sweetie. We have American, Swiss, cheddar, and provolone and, since you seem kind of fancy, I'd go with the provolone. - Scratch the sandwich, I'll take the coffee. - All right. Suit yourself. - [Cameron] Thanks. Excuse me? - [Miranda] Yeah? - So this, uh, open mic thing you guys have going on tomorrow night, anyone good ever perform? - Sweetie, you're not from around here, are ya? - Afraid not. - Yeah, I could tell with that whole cheese business thing. But the truth is that we do have a lot of talent and people perform here. As a matter of fact, Faith Winters is from Smithville. Heard of her? - The country music singer> - Word has it, she's back in town. Kind of hoping she swings through and gives us a private concert. - That'd be very special. - [Miranda] Yes it would. - [Cameron] Faith, I'm in Smithville, please call me. (soft acoustic guitar playing) - Here you go. - Thanks. Can't get enough of this. - They don't have sweet tea in Nashville? - Oh, they do. It just aint the same. Well, I guess I'm gonna turn my phone on. - Is that supposed to be a big deal for some reason? - Well it hasn't been on since I left Nashville. How much you wanna bet I got a hundred messages? - Girl you got the gamblin' from your daddy. You got the singin' from me. - This is the stuff I miss. Man, I forgot how quiet it can be without all the noise. You get to actually see the stars out here. - Yep. Aint nothin' like it. I can see the whole world from right here. - Maybe that's what I need. To see the world a little differently for a while.

(insects buzzing) - What's this> - Homework. - You workin' on your homework? Wow. Hold that pose. I've got to preserve this moment. Who do I get to thank for this miracle? Your aunt Annie. - Howdy Gavin. - Jenny. I didn't even realize you were here. - Oh yeah well, Annie called me and told me that Zoe was having some trouble with her homework, so, I wasn't doing anything else tonight and I figured I might as well come over and help y'all out. I mean heaven knows y'all have enough to worry about right now. - [Gavin] That's very nice of ya... - How's Faith> - She's good. - Oh, there you are. I was gettin' worried. You know, I know how you Whitfields like to sneak around at night and all. - Too soon. - Did you have a nice visit> - Yeah. I didn't realize Jenny was gonna be here. I just was thanking her for helping Zoe. - I think I'm finished. Would you take a look? - Happy to help. That's very good, Zoe. Well. Well, I'm gonna get my stuff and, um, I'm gonna be headin' out then. Okay. Bye. - Bye, Jenny. Thanks for comin'. - Thanks, Miss Sharp. - Zoe, you ready to go> (phone pings) - Oh, oh wait. Mike's gettin' ready to Skype in. Y'all come say hi. - Why don't you get your stuff together, okay> - Come on, come on guys. - Hey babe. - Hi, honey. How are you? - Hm. I'm good, hangin' in there. It's been a quiet few days, thank God. - Oh wait, I got a couple of folks that wanna say hi. (chuckles) - What's up, bubba? - Hey did you get the care package we sent you? - The unit loved the cookies, thank you so much. - You mean you didn't eat 'em all yourself? - I wish. Wait, is that Zoe back there, too> - Yes. - Hi, Uncle Mike. - Hey, Zo. How's music class and dance and everything? - School's almost out. - And your singin', it's coming along well> - Yes, sir. For the most part. - Hey y'all, sorry to interrupt. - Oh hi Jenny, what's wrong? - Well, y'all aren't gonna believe this, but, my car won't start. - I believe it. - Oh, wow. - Pastor, um, do you mind giving me a ride home? - Of course, I'll give you a ride home. - That's so nice of you. (chuckles) That's nice, isn't it nice? That's nice. Um, oh hey, Zoe, you can just stay here with me until they get back, right? Okay. - Oh sis, I don't wanna put you out. - Oh no, no, no. Time with my precious niece, it's a blessing. - Okay. All right Mike, you be safe, buddy. - Thank you bud. See you later. - All right, take care. - Are they gone> - Yeah. - Annie, you're still trying to set 'em up? - You know what, she's a good person and she'd be really good for him. - Never gonna happen. - You know, I thought I was gonna take you straight home. - Oh come on, don't be such a dud. Everybody's gotta eat, even pastors, too. - I just gotta hurry home to Zoe. - [Cameron] Faith, I'm in Smithville. Babe, please call me. - It's Cameron. - [Liz] What does he want? - He's already in Smithville. - [Liz] What? - He's at Sammy's Cafe. I gotta go. - I wanted to tell you that I didn't realize that video was gonna be such a problem. But pastor, you have to understand, people are really affected by Zoe's music. - Zoe's talented, but she shouldn't have been up here at that time of night, so. - Well, she silenced the crowd, that's for sure. - You know what they say about talent without discipline, don't ya? It's like an octopus on roller skates. A lot of movement, just don't know what direction it's goin'. (laughing) - Okay. Well. Y'all hungry> - Starved. Um, I'll have steak and eggs. Steak, medium, eggs over easy, dry toast, and a diet coke. - Okay, lady knows what she wants, I like it. And for you pastor? - Black coffee, my regular, grilled cheese, American please. - [Miranda] No brie? - Huh? - It's a joke. (knocking) - Oh, Zoe, I'm so glad you're here. I need to talk to your dad. - Oh, he's not here. - What, he just> He said that he was comin' to get you. - Well, look who the cat drug in. Faith Winters. - Annie, hey. You look great. - Do I> - You do. Listen, I'm sorry it's so late. I was just telling Zoe I really need to find Gavin. - Well I think you heard Zoe say that Gavin's not here. - Well, I mean, do you know where he is? I mean, he's not answerin' his phone. - I think there's a good reason for that. - Annie, I know you would rather have opened the door for literally anyone else, but can you at least help me get in touch with Gavin? - Why would I do that? You broke my brother's heart. - I know, I know, and I wanna have that conversation with all of you, but my ex is in town. And he told me, he said if he ever had the chance to come to Smithville, that he would hunt Gavin down and... - And what? - Well he never finished the sentence, but it can't be anything good. - He's with Jenny, at Sammy's Cafe. - Jenny> - Jenny Sharp. - My teacher. - Oh right, right. That's complicated. But um, wait, you said he's at Sammy's? - Yes. - Uh oh. - She's unbelievably talented. I mean she sings, she dances. I just gotta get her to focus on her studies. I mean, she's gonna have to get a scholarship because I don't know how I'm gonna pay for her to go to college. - You are such an amazing man. - Jenny. You gotta stop sayin' that, I'm just a man. - [Jenny] Gavin, you do not give yourself enough credit. - I'm doing what any decent father would do. - Excuse me, is your name Gavin? - Yeah. - Pastor Gavin Whitfield? - Yeah, that's me. - I always told Faith if I had an opportunity to meet you, I'd say thank you for allowing her to come to Nashville. - Cameron, stop. - Oh, I'm sorry, I'm Cameron. I'm Faith's fiance. - Ex-fiance. What are you doin'? - I was just thankin' Gavin here. - Thank you? What are you thankin' him for> - For allowing you to come to music city and spread your wings. I always told you if I came to Smithville, I'd give him a thank you. - No. No, you never finished that sentence. - Well I sure did intend to. I owe this man a lot for bringing you into my life. - Well stop. - Stop what? - Stop acting like we're still together, Cameron. Obviously I left you, remember? - Okay, babe, I made a mistake but as of yesterday we were engaged, so calm down. Let's go some place where we can talk. - Don't tell me what to do, okay? - Can we just go some place and talk? - No. - What about our history? - What history? - On top of being engaged, didn't I get you your first record deal, huh> And your second? Doesn't that mean anything to you> - Yeah, yeah, you know what it means? Remember that 10% you collected> Yeah, check your bank account. That's how much it meant. - Faith. - How's Pia doin', huh? - Faith. - How's precious little Pia? - Faith. Look, can we go some place and talk? - Are you crazy? Did you just come all the way here to Smithville and thing everything's gonna be all right, huh? - Can we go some place and talk about what you're doin'> Turn around. (slow, dramatic music) - Even in Smithville. I guess I can't run this time. Hey y'all. - [Cameron] And your second. Doesn't that mean anything to you> - Oh my. - [Hope] Yeah, remember that 10% you collected> Check your bank account, baby boy. That's how much it means. - This is better than streaming. - How's Pia doin', huh> - Faith? - How's precious little Pia> - Faith, turn around and look. Can we go some place> - Are you crazy? Did you just come all the way here to Smithville and think everything's gonna be all right, huh? - I wonder what he's doin' here. (slow, dramatic music) Cameron. - Pastor Gavin. I'm sure you're shocked to see me, but I assure you, I'm not here for trouble. I wanna talk to you about somethin' I'm truly interested in. - Okay, what's that> - What's the population of Smithville? - I don't know, six, 7,000 maybe. - And how many churches do you guys have here> - Don't know. - 17. - You counted? - Yep. I even counted the, uh, converted convenience store at the edge of town. - I didn't realize that was a church. - Well, I guess it is. But, the point I'm trying to make is, once you figure in the agnostics, those who are no longer practicing, people who just don't care about religion, and the downright atheists, I guess you could say this town's a little church heavy. - Church heavy> - It's the law of diminishing return. They taught us in economics. I'm sure you took econ, right? Let me try to break it down in a way that somebody like yourself can understand. - Oh, I understand. Too many churches, not enough people? - More or less. - Yeah, you see, I don't believe that. I believe people worship where they're led. - How many people are actually in your congregation? - That's none of your business. Why don't you show up Sunday and maybe you'll find out. - The other night when we were at Sammy's Cafe, before I ran into you, I was speaking to the waitress. She let me know that Faith Winters is not the only musical prodigy from this town. - She's right. There's a lot of talented people around here. - You guys do have a lot of talent, but you know what you don't have? A record studio. - What's this> - Just read it. - We're not being foreclosed. - Well not today. But this morning I took the liberty of driving over to the bank and speaking to Mr. Daniels, your mortgage broker. He let me know that you're about 30 days out. And that's if you're lucky. So the way I see it, we'll have a big fountain here at the front, a couple of benches, and out back, we'll put gazebos along the tree line, so the artists will be able to listen to the birds chirp. I'm gonna call them inspiration spaces. Now of course the church will be gone. But in its place will be a state of the art recording studio, top of the line. I heard your daughter is very talented. I'd love to speak with her. - The church is staying here, buddy. - I'll see you in 30 days, pastor. Matter of fact, I'll see you Sunday morning. - Pastor? - Is Benny serious> He's really gonna foreclose> - He's serious. But he did say he'd give us a little bit of time. - That's nice of him, but, I don't think that's gonna do us any good. - I'm sorry Gavin, but you need to take a look at the ledger though, all right? (slow country music) - Why are you doin' this to me? What did I do to deserve this> Is it your will that I lose the church? (slow country music) You took my wife. And I was faithful. And then my flock, to other pastures, and I was faithful, and now you, you rip very the pulpit from my grasp. And I'm faithful. (slow, melancholy country music) - [Faith] All right, there you go. - [Girls] Thank you. - Thank you. Zoe. - Hi Faith, um, Miss Winters. - Faith's fine. You have one incredible gift. - You really think so> - Think? Girl, I know. Come here. You know, when my daddy was alive, he used to always say that he believed that music was a direct connection from our mouth, to God's ear. (chuckles) - Why? - Because think about it. I mean, if you're God, you got a lot of people prayin'. That's a lot of noise. But with music, he just has to sit, and listen. - I like that. - I think Movement Church needs God's ear again, don't you? - So does my dad. - Has your dad told you anything about me? - He said that y'all dated. And that he loved you. - I loved him, too. - No. You don't understand. He like, loved you, loved you. Like enough to marry you. And then you left. - Yeah. I might never forgive myself for that one. - He has. - I know, he told me. So, um, I heard that there's some problems here. Are you afraid that y'all are gonna lose the church> Well what are we gonna do about it> - What do you mean> - I wasn't there for your dad when your mom died. And I can't change that. But I can be here now. - You have something already planned, don't you? - Only if you promise to help. - I promise. - Great. Well I got somebody who wants to say hi. Mom? (chuckles) - Hi Zoe. - Hi Miss Liz. - How are you? - Good. - Great. Are you in? - Yeah. (chuckles) - Great. - Good, well, we need one more person. - Yeah. - Aunt Annie? - Yeah, but we're gonna need your help with her. (chuckles) - Hey dad. - Hey. - What ya doin'? - I'm lookin' for every red cent I can find to buy Movement some time. Nobody will be able to tell you your daddy never tried. How was practice? - It was good. Great, actually. - Miss Sharp bring you home? - I think you two need to talk. Love you. - Love you too. (soft music) I thought I made it clear on the bleachers where I stood. - You did. So I heard about Cameron and Movement. You got a plan yet? - You're lookin' at it. - Well I made some phone calls today, and I was able to buy us some more time. - Us> - Yes. Gavin, I'm here, aint I? - For how long? - As long as it takes. - Listen, Faith, I'm not taking your money. - Gavin, I don't even have enough money to do what I'm gonna propose we do. - What did you have in mind? - We're not just gonna make payments. We're gonna pay it off. So like I said, we're gonna save Movement Church. You're supposed ask me how. - Okay, I'll play along. How? - This place is gonna be packed out. For a Faith Winters concert. - Seriously? - Yeah. - Why? I mean, why would you do that> - Gavin, don't you remember> 15 years ago, right here, you told me that you believed in me. (chuckles) - Yeah. - So what do you think? - I think you don't have to do this. - Hey, I'm not doin' anything. We are. - A good man aint worth nothin' without a bunch of... - Good women holdin' him up. - Gavin, you've done a lot for Smithville, and it's time you let us do our part. - Dad, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize how much pressure you were under. - All right, girls. Let's give him a little preview. ♪ Amazing grace ♪ ♪ How sweet the sound ♪ ♪ That saved a wretch ♪ ♪ Like me ♪ (soft music) - Howdy Gavin. - Hey. - What ya up to> - I'm just thinkin'. - Thinkin'. Well, Annie sent me over here to make sure that you aren't thinkin' too hard or stressing yourself out or overworkin' yourself. So, I think it's my duty to take you out and do somethin' fun. (sighs) - Listen, I, I'd love to. I would, but... - Well then let's go. - I've got so much goin' on with Movement right now. I've got Zoe who's sneaking out of the house at night. I'm trying to be a good father, I'm trying to be a good pastor, and I just can't seem to get everything done well. And, listen, if I had more time. - I understand. I do. Look, Gavin, I, I know I'm not some big star or anything, but, I promise you that I'll be a good friend. Listen, if there's anything that you need, at all, I'm your girl. - I appreciate that. - Absolutely. Don't work yourself too hard now. - All right. (laughs) You have a good night. - [Jenny] You, too. (soft music) - [Miranda] Hey Faith. - Her Miranda. - Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Uh, listen, I think you ought to know he's here. - Who> Oh. Cameron's here. Okay. - Sorry. - Well, thanks for the heads up, girl. - I think he's up by the stage. - Okay. Fabulous. - Is that your homework> - No. It's my song book. - Oh. That would explain why it looks so worn. Are you ready> - What do you think? - I think you're gonna blow 'em away. - I'm nervous. There's so many people out there. And, they're all watching me. - Remember that promise I made you when you first came home with us? That no matter where life took you, you'd never be alone? Go. Perform. You were born for this. Okay> I'll see you out there. All right. (soft music) - You ready? - Man, I haven't had these butterflies in years. But I've never been more ready. - I'm kind of scared. - Hey, you know how they always say to just imagine the audience in their underwear? Don't do that. It'll just make you laugh. (laughs) You're gonna be just fine. - [Liz] We got you, Z. - I say we give 'em what they came here for. - Let's do it. - All right. How y'all doin'? (audience cheering) I said how y'all doin'?

I heard about Cameron was trying to do to your church, and however much extra it is to cover the costs of the church and the land, I wanna pay for it or find someone who can. - No, no, no, no, you don't have to do that, no. - Just Gavin, stop. Okay, look, Faith told me all about you and in some round about way, I feel like you're responsible for my success. You know, that girl did everything she did because she knew you would see it. - That was awesome. Great job. - I'll be right back. I have to go get my notebook. - Okay, all right. - You are beautiful, beautiful. - Thank you. - That was so good. - Good to see you. - You too.

Thank you for everything you've done for Faith. - My gosh, please, what about everything Faith's done for me> - You should take my number. - Yeah, it was nice meeting you. - Looks like Cameron's had enough. - Yeah, I'll be right back. - Careful with that one. - Cameron. - You know what, Faith, I get it. Your stupid little Footloose town likes to take care of their own. I won't take their property. (chuckles) - No, you can't admit defeat to something you already lost. - Maybe. But you could have been a star. - No Cameron, I could have been myself, and clearly that wasn't good enough for you. But it's good enough for me. All right, well, I guess I'm gonna do a song for y'all. Um, I know it's been quite a bit of a shock to see me back in Smithville. I know maybe some of you might not have been too happy to see me, but, I was really happy to see you. Since I was a little girl, I've just been in love with daisies. And, uh, as beautiful as they are, it takes many years for their roots to grow strong and deep. And, I just realized that I've spent most of my life puttin' down roots and pullin' 'em up at the first sign of danger or change, or a challenge, or commitment. And, uh, I've decided I'd really like to plant myself here for a few seasons and see how high I can grow with you. This song is about that, it's called "Runnin' From My Roots."
