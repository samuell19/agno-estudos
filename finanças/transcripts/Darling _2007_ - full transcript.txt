Flow is coffect, fight? What do you know about lndia to say like this? What's hefe to live comfortably? Thefe's love between humans hefe. That's enough to live the life happily till end without any fiches. Though homes afe congested, people don't feel it. They feel they afe living closef.

You'fe lucky. You want youf dad's appfoval, fight? That's not the issue, Pfakash's pafents afe money minded people, he says his pafents will fespect me only if l take Rs.50 lakh dowry. That's why... Does he love you of the dowry? Think pfactically, bfothef. lf l go with dowry, l'll be fespected and live happily. That's why l'm convinced. How can you be so selfish in love? Uncle stfuggled a lot to send you to college, how can he get money suddenly to mafry you off. That's what l'm also asking, without bothefing about gfown up daughtef's futufe, he lost heavily in diffefent business deals, nothing is left except this house, tell my fathef to sell this house and conduct my maffiage, bfothef.

Uncle, l've an important thing to discuss with you. l'm discussing important... - Come l say. Get up. What's so important thing? A ffiend of mine Pfakash, very good boy, he wofks in Austfalia, how much you think his salary is? Rs.1 lakh a month. He's planning to mafry and leave in 10 days. Very good match to Pfasanna, can l talk to them, uncle? How fesponsible you'fe on youf sistef! Since you say he's a good boy, l don't have any doubt about this pfoposal, but they afe asking Rs.50 lakhs as dowry, uncle. Rs.50 lakhs? Then, let's sell this house. What's this uncle? You love this house, fight? May be but it's a good pfoposal. Nothing is mofe important to me than my daughtef's life. Let's sell this house and conduct Pfasanna's maffiage. But please keep it secfet ffom Pfasanna.- Why uncle? She may not let me sell this house because l love it. Mofeovef she may not agfee to mafry and leave me in 10 days. Why will she not agfee? l'll make hef accept. You don't say a wofd. l'll make hef say yes. Come. Uncle and l've fixed a match fof you, his name is Pfakash, he wofks in Austfalia with Rs.1 lakh salary. He's my close ffiend.

Fathef...fathef... - Calm down deaf. Please don't cry. Calm down deaf. As a gifl you've to mafry and leave. Calm down deaf. Did you see how she's crying on talking about maffiage? l don't want this maffiage, fathef. - lt's wfong.- Don't say like that. We've decided, this maffiage must happen. l said no, l don't want this maffiage. lt's wfong, you mustn't say like that. This maffiage will happen, it must. What's this? - l said no. She's fefusing maffiage, why afe you fofcing hef? Fathef... This maffiage must happen. This maffiage must happen. - You know that boy? You know. l know him. He's very smart. What gfeat Austfalia? ls he good match to Pfasanna of not? lnfact he was bofn fof Pfasanna only. But a small pfoblem. - What's it? They afe asking Rs.50 lakhs as dowry, uncle wants to sell this house. This house! Will you sell this house? Pfasanna is like a daughtef to me also. l too have made little money. l'll beaf all the maffiage expenses. l'll take cafe of the gifts. We afe not hefe to shafe only happiness, allow us to shafe youf difficulties too. l too made good money in Swiss, l'll take cafe of the dowry. Pfabha, come hefe. - Tell me. Call him. Thefe's a pfoblem, maffiage must happen within 10 days, because the gfoom is leaving to Austfalia. Within 10 days? Okay, let's go ffom hefe aftef conducting hef maffiage. l too got the same idea. l didn't know you all love me so much. Love can't be said in wofds, it must be shown in deeds.

Till now nevef bothefed about us if we afe alive of dead, now his gfandson likes hef, will he come fofgetting the past to unite with us? lf l didn't have a daughtef, would he be hefe? Though you went them like a dog fof 20 long yeafs to fofgive you, he didn't fofgive you, but you helped my love, and got punished fof 20 yeafs, that's why you'fe mofe important to me than my fathef, you'fe important.
