[DRILLING] [RATTLING] [BACKGROUND MUSIC] [HISSING SOUND] [HISSING SOUND] [RATTLING] [GUST] [EAGLE SCREAMING] [BACKGROUND MUSIC] [GUNSHOT] -Ever since the terrorists have started using mobile phones... -[BUZZING] we have developed a new software, from the security point of view. It has been fed into this system. Whenever words like murder, rape, RDX or bombs are associated... with the names of VIPs, their number will be flashed on this immediately. Good. I've noticed objectionable words being used several times... ...since this morning on this number. On whose name is the number registered? We've checked the record of the cell-phone operator. -Both the name and address are fake. -Naturally. The cell-phone company wants to sell its services... whether it's a tourist or a terrorist. Switch on the location identification system. Tell me where the cell-phone user is right now. Yes Sir. The caller is at the poolside of Hotel Sunshine in Juhu. Very Good. Keep a close watch on him. Keep me posted on every movement of his. -Okay, Sir. -Excuse me, Sir. Good try that. Mike. Hello. Mike. Come in Mike. Come in. Hello. Sir, poolside. Hello. This way. -Hello... Hello. -Hello, yes. -Your cell-phone was out of range, sir. -I'm at the poolside now. Go on. That cell-phone is now out of range, sir. Damn. Locate him. Track them as soon as possible. Yeah. Okay. -Hello. -Come in. He's in room number 204 of the same hotel. Okay, okay. Come on. Check in there. -Sir... -I know. -Mike. -Yes Sir? -There's no one in the room, Mike. -Our system still shows... that the cell phone is in room 204. -Are you sure? -Yes sir. [BEEPING] There. Akram Shaikh, you will always lag behind. So they knew we've been following them. -Sir. -Yes? I found this map of Mumbai from the dustbin. -This looks like L sir. -L...? Could also be 7. What's with L or 7 that the terrorists could target in Mumbai? 7-ways, 7-bungalows...? Lamington Road, Lokhandwala, Linking Road...? Pradeep. Lipstick. Which means, one of the three is a woman. Mr. Dara, they're here. Hey. Not her. Only we brothers have the right to search her. Many many happy returns of the day, Mr. Dara. You turn 60 today and there will be a grand party this evening. But we regret, we will not be able to attend. -So we thought of... -Personally wishing you on your birthday. Thank you. You are a father-figure to us. The Godfather in the business of Arms trafficking. Please accept your birthday gift. -You're the one who has it, right? -Strange! How would it be with me? It's with you! -But you were supposed to carry it! -Rubbish. it was you... -No, no. it's not okay. -We must give you the gift. [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] -Let's celebrate. -Okay! Happy death day to you! Happy death day to you! Happy death day dear Dara... [GUNSHOTS] [ELECTRIC SPARK] "I'm an apocalypse" "I'm an apocalypse" "I'm an apocalypse" "I'm an apocalypse" "I had to make you belong to me..." "This meeting was just a pretext" "I had to make you belong to me..." "This meeting was just a pretext" "I wanted to steal your heart..." "This meeting was just a pretext" "Apocalypse..." "I'm an apocalypse" "Apocalypse..." "I spell apocalypse" "I haven't slept for many nights" "I've been lost in your thoughts" "I've touched this and seen" "Your body is like a glass" "I wished to drive you mad..." "This meeting was just a pretext" "I wanted to steal your heart..." "This meeting was just a pretext" "Apocalypse..." "I'm an apocalypse" "Apocalypse..."

However, children... time is not good now. I have news from the CBI that one Akram Shaikh is hot on your trail. -He'll always keep trailing. -In missiles and arms... -we've gone too far ahead anyway. -If you get caught... I won't remain the Home Minister anymore. Do you understand that? If this deal goes through, you will become the Chief Minister, Uncle. Don't call me Uncle, okay? You're very mischievous. Now tell me. What are you doing about Akram Shaikh? Donâ€™t worry be happy. [GROANING] Hey. Did that hurt? I'll tell you! -There names are Ali, Abbas... -Damn it, Suresh-bhai! Why didn't you tell me earlier? Why do you provoke violence in Gandhi's land? Sir, Mr. Khurana. Sir. Has he told you something? A police beating is quite something else, sir. Even the mute starts singing. Well, said. Thank you Sir. My suspicion was right, Sir. Small-time thieves four years ago, Ali and Abbas... are today's biggest arms-dealers. Ever since America is keeping a vigil on other countries... these terrorists wants to turn India into a marketplace for firearms. Don't worry, Sir. We will not let India get a bad name in the rest of the world. This is very serious. Get cracking on the case Akram. You are now in-charge of the case. Sir, Dara's murder, the seizure of the map from the hotel room... I don't know why, but I feel... that there's a storm in the offing. The city's under threat, Sir. We've been after Dara for so many days for these weapons. Finally we've got them. What a figure! Sleek and sexy! -We only need a virus now. -Funny! Not even the girls I promise marriage every day are as suspicious as you are. I told you, you'll have the virus. In which case, the government will go down on its knees. We can spell doom. How about making a call to Brigadier Rashid? Our contact in the ISI. This cake in the shape of India, in the flavour of pistachio... -[TELEPHONE RINGING] -[LAUGHS] in green! it's going to be fun relishing it. Hello. Ali Abbas! Have you got your hands on those missiles? Yes, you need to help us now. And we will help you. It's like this, brother. Every Muslim from the land of the infidels finds shelter in our land. Anyone who teaches the infidels a lesson... becomes the King of the palaces of Karachi. You must teach them a lesson too. The serial bomb-blasts of '93 are fading from memory. What Dara could never do, we will do. Wow! Wonderful! Take shelter from us. And take the money from them. -God protect you. -God protect you. Mr. Vajpayee wants peace. And we want pieces. Pieces of India. Especially this one... Kashmir. Our virus will show such magic in Mumbai... that talks between the countries will collapse, even before they begin. This virus could very well become a bigger issue than Kashmir. Excuse me, Sir. -A delegation from the Defence Ministry has arrived, Sir. -Good morning Sir. The director wants you to brief them on the virus. Okay. I will be there. Good day, Sir. Sir, these important files are going to the U.N. Please sign them. Thank you, Sir. Gopal... morning. -How are you, Gopal? -How should I be? I hear you're going to brief a delegation from the Defence Ministry? You will go to America to do a research at the director's recommendation... and when you return, you will be the joint-director, Sir! How am I to feel? I've worked all night and prepared a progressive report on the virus. Have a look at this. Gopal... what... You... have a dirty mind. Ladies and gentlemen. Our research team is being headed by a young, brilliant scientist Rahul Gupta. -Rahul. -Sir. Members of the Delegation... my seniors. The enemy every day warns us of a nuclear war. He prepares chemical and biological weapons. Our intelligence have unearthed the information... that the enemy has developed this virus. If this virus is dropped in our country through missiles... people will suffer to death. No one will survive. Air, water and land... wherever this virus explodes... it will affect the nervous system of everyone in a radius of 10 kilometres. Our research team is therefore preparing an antidote. An anti-virus, like the ones used for Cholera and Typhoid. Should this virus be mixed in water... we're trying to develop something that will prevent it from becoming poisonous. A virus as deadly as this one, no human brain has ever given birth to. But our research team has made good progress. In a month or two, we will succeed in our mission. -Any questions? -No Sir. Sir. Hey, Sheetal, sorry I am late. What will you drink? [MUSIC PLAYING] She will have a Fruit Punch. I'll have a double large vodka. Yes, Sir. Hey. I'm enjoying! I've even asked for a double large vodka today. -Rahul, there's no one in my house tonight. -Yes? Why? Where has everyone gone? [MUSIC PLAYING] Daddy's in Bangalore, Mummy's... Bangalore! What a beautiful city. Dr. Kalam is there too. He's got a lovely lab. Shut up. I am sick of your lab business. Okay? Ma'am, you're Fruit Punch. Sir, you're vodka. Thank you. Rahul... try and understand. Tonight, I'm all alone in my house. Now look, just don't be afraid. Keep the doors and windows shut. -Keep a torch within reach. If possible, call Bunty over... -Rahul! Okay okay... don't spoil your mood. Please don't spoil your mood. There's something I wish to tell you today. Something ultimately romantic. What? Will you marry me? Rahul... you're very cute. Thanks. But, learn to be a man first. [MUSIC PLAYING] Sheetal, you...? -[MUSIC PLAYING] -[SIGH] Man? I'm a man. [WATER SPLASHING] "I am in love" "Something has happened to me" "I am leaving my body in your arms" "It's in pain now" "I am in love" "Close all the windows and drop all the curtains" "Let's annihilate the space between us" "A miracle happened" "Something has happened to me" "Leaving your body on my arms" "It's in pain now" "I'm in love" "My body bows over the flame of love and gets distracted" "My breath slips, aspirations are distracted and my body is full of scent" "We are nursing a hangover" "Something has happened" "I am leaving my body in your arms" "It's in pain now" "I'm in love" "Something has happened" "I am leaving my body in your arms" "It's in pain now" [SIGH] -Hello? -Hi Rahul! I'm leaving for the trip. The boat's ready. Take care and have a great time. You ought to have joined me, stupid. Yeah! [CLATTERS] I've got work to do. We're doing some intense work. -SHEETAL: I know your intense work. Listen... -But you're a... Listen, listen... -Hello. -Shit! Listen, Rahul... Hello. Rahul. Rahul. Where are you? You don't even talk properly. Idiot! [ALARM BUZZING] [SIGH] Sir. I found the virus-ball lying outside on my table. It ought to be in the safe! Let's check the safe. Oh my God. How could this happen? Call the security. Sir, Gopal was here last evening. Let's ask him. Gopal. -Go call him. Go... -Yeah. Gopal. GUIDE: This is the Elphinstone Jail. Many notorious criminals used to be held here. -And how were they brought here? -Just as you were brought here. -Mister, I'm the one she asked. Why did you answer the question? -Yes? Because I know a lot about this jail too. Maybe you do. But why snatch my livelihood? How will I tell you what else I'm going to snatch? GOPAL: This jail is surrounded by the sea. No prisoner could therefore run away. How do you know the detailed history of this jail? I know of the things that happened, and also what's about to happen. Please come... let's go towards the lock-ups. Ladies and gentlemen... and pretty pretty girls. Welcome to the Elphinstone Jail's prison cells. This is the place where dreaded criminals were held for years... without any food or water. You sleep in your houses... with the air-conditioners on. But take a look in these jails sometimes. You will learn a huge lesson! -Just Kidding... -[LAUGHS] I was only kidding! I only wanted you to feel what those prisoners felt. GOPAL: Take a look at these jails. Maybe they'll wash away your sins. Go to the cells. -Come. Let's go... -Girls! Come on, come on... quickly. -Welcome to the most secure prison in the whole world. -[CROWD CHATTERING]. May you be blessed in jail! Quickly... quickly. Come on fast. We have less time. Everybody's in...? -Guards. -[SHOUTING] Lock them up. [CLAMOURING] What's happening here? It's the beginning of a game. You're the prisoners. And we're the jailors. What the hell is happening? -[KEYPAD SOUND] -[SHUSHING] It's no use trying to use your mobile phones. We've jammed your mobile phones here. You've got it? Who are you...? Sorry! I'm no guide. I'm a scientist. And now starts a deadly game. [CLAMOURING] [GUNSHOT] We're holding you hostages. Till the government meets our demands, you folks will remain here. We have no enmity against you. But you must do as we say. Get us out of here! -[GUNSHOT] -[SHOUTING] Let's move now. Surround the jail with guards. Use the radars. Put missiles on a standby mode. At every entry point, deploy motion sensors. -Move... move. -Move. -James, what's this? -It's a motion sensor. Whenever someone gets close to it, our computers will alert us. And if someone even defuses it, we'll still get to know. You mean we'll get to know immediately that someone has arrived? You're right. Laila. Where have you placed the seven missiles? One's in the tower, two in the library... two in the ammunition room, and two in the Portuguese room. I've connected you both to the C.M.'s phone. [TELEPHONE RINGING] All right Sir. Hello. C.M., bad news for you. We've turned the Elphinstone Jail into a prison again. What rubbish are you talking? Who are you? Don't interrupt. Talk only when we ask you to. Go ahead now. -Why're you asking him to talk? -Okay, shut up! What? -You talk. -Who are you? You spoke up again! So let me tell you. We're mad men. By the end, we're going to turn you mad too. We've captured 213 tourists. Including some foreigners. Who are you? Who? Who are we...? Why? You want to get your daughter married to them? -Even if you want to, don't offer the guests any water. -Yes. If they drink the water, they're doing to die! With our missiles, we have targeted the seven lakes... which supply drinking water to the whole of Mumbai. Our missiles are carrying not just explosives... there's also the virus we have stolen from the CDC Lab. C.M., if you don't meet our demands, we'll let go of a missile... and the whole of Mumbai will perish with the water. You dare not. Don't talk, C.M. Just watch our trailer. At the lake in Goregaon. Full of emotions... and cries of agony. Go and watch the virus show... live! [BEEP SOUND] Hello? Cancel all my appointments for the day... and connect me to CBI Headquarters immediately. [SOBBING] -What's happening here. Why isn't anyone saying anything Sir? -[CAMERA CLICKING] -What is happening actually? -[CLAMOURING] 28 people are dead, a child's suffering... tell us something, Sir! Sir, this is due to the virus. It's horrible. [SIREN WAILING] Look at this. AKRAM: Oh my God. Let's go. RAHUL: -Siddhu, I need sample of the well's water. -Okay Sir. [AMBULANCE SIREN SOUND] People have died a horrible death! We've seen 29 bodies today, it'll be 29 lakhs soon! I'm glad they haven't contaminated the air to terrorise us. They've only contaminated the well water. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello. One moment. Call from Elphinstone Jail, Sir. 1500 crores and a ship to get out of here. -What? -Aren't you recording it? Listen to what you've recorded. -You have 24 hours. -C.M.: I get it. You spoke up again? All right, go ahead. You must speak every now and then. As for what we can do, you've seen a sample at the well in Goregaon. I'll explain. Until we have sailed across the Arabian Sea... the 213 hostages will remain with us on the ship. You're already using your brains... as to what you've got to do in the next 24 hours. Tell him, James. Anything done within a radius of 3 kilometres of this jail... will see our missiles land in the seven lakes of Mumbai. You've got it. Murthy. If you try to explode the missile in mid-air, they'll no doubt blow up. But the virus will spread everywhere in the atmosphere... and kill all of you. You get that? 24 hours... to doomsday. These criminals who have taken over the Elphinstone jail... are they indeed capable of doing something so dangerous? They are. -Akram...? -Sir. Lights off please. Ali Rehmani. Chemical Engineer. Very Intelligent. 1st class 1st. He found many jobs, but because of his abusive nature... and his bad habits, he couldn't keep any job. Basically, a criminal mind. [FLASH SOUND] Abbas Rehmani. Computer Engineer. Like his brother, very intelligent... dreams of becoming rich overnight. The two of them deal in defence equipment only in name. But actually, they're agents of international arms-smugglers. [FLASH SOUND] Laila. Once the life of the discos in Mumbai. She's the life of the two brothers now. [FLASH SOUND] James Ricardo. The gang's techno-brain. He used to work for the NASA earlier. AKRAM: Murthy, worked in an explosives factory. Expert at explosives. [FLASH SOUND] AKRAM: Lop, a radar-expert. AKRAM: Trained in North Korea. Lights please. There's another thing. As smart as they are in committing a crime... they're equally adept at wiping out the evidence. Which is why, we have only information. We have no evidence. We have informers, no witnesses. Is there no way we can escape from this virus? No way out? This virus spreads very quickly in air and water, Sir. In Mumbai, it'll spread faster because of the humid conditions. Oh my God. This virus could perhaps be destroyed with fire. We're still experimenting, Sir. To begin with, alert the navy. Seal the area, 3 kilometres in the radius of the Elphinstone Jail. So that no vessel, whether it belongs to the fishermen or the government... goes there. And declare the same area as no-fly zone. Alert all the emergency services. And please... think of a sure-shot plan to rid ourselves of this crisis. I'll go and have a word with the P.M. [BACKGROUND MUSIC] [AMBULANCE WAILING] Oh Shit! Hold it. -Why that smoke... gas? -Reaction. Oh God! We must get the gas out of the chamber! Else, they can't get out either. The gas will spread through the lab. Hey take the gas out. The experiment has succeeded. Put the exhaust on! RAHUL: Put the concentrate in the test tube. RAHUL: Yes. This virus can be destroyed with fire. 10 seconds more. Come out. Wow! We've done it. All set. We've fixed sensors and motion detectors on all the ways to the jail. Good! if the C.M. acts smart, they're going to get caught. [ALL LAUGHING] We've even laid landmines everywhere. -You've got to watch your step, Laila. -What for? If you are blown up, we brothers are going to be widowed. I hope you've marked the areas where you laid the landmines. I want to live with her. [SIGH] And I... want to die with her. Even if we die, we'll take the whole of Mumbai with us. -This news must not be leaked to the media. -[TELEPHONE RINGING] -Any contact with the tourist's kin? -Yes, Sir. They have been taken into confidence. Good. -What about the firebombs? -The air-force's firebombs... will burn everyone there along with the virus. I hope that moment never arrives. But that should be our last option. How are we to attack them? If their radar intercepts our bombs, their missiles will all be fired. And Mumbai...! There must be some way out. There must be some way out. -There is a way, Sir. -Which one? To get into the jail through the water. In the sea is a secret way, where there are several other tunnels. One of the tunnels lead to the septic tank in the jail. And there's just one man who knows about it. Good, very good... then go ahead. -But there's a problem, Sir. -What? The man who knows about the way, is serving a term in the Pune jail. What...? How does he...? He's the only man who successfully ran away from the Elphinstone Jail. What is he serving a sentence for? Murder. There are other charges against him too. You want to take the help of a criminal like him? Yes. Do we have a choice? How will such a man pull off something so difficult? Hatred is an intense power, Sir. He was once a friend of Ali and Abbas. He's their enemy today. What? Okay. Go ahead. Sir, call from the PMO. -Hello, Sir. -Akram. Yes Sir. How did you find out so much about this criminal? A man who can run away from the Elphinstone Jail... is someone we must have information on. Sir, please take a look at his file. I've only told you about the hatred he harbours in his heart. But the sentiment that drove him to break jail... was his love for someone. "Loneliness everywhere" "Sombreness in the air" "Her memories..." "bring tears to my eyes" "I breathe restlessly" "There's an ache in my heart" "Separated from my beloved" "Life is no fun at all" "She torments me so much" "That girl, I miss so much" "That girl, I miss so much" "She makes me laugh sometimes" "She makes me cry sometimes" "She torments me so much" [BACKGROUND MUSIC] "Sweetheart, beloved" "You are the one I have loved" "Restlessness grips my heart" "What ache have you given to my heart?"

As if you'd stay back if I asked you to. I could even lay down my life, if you asked me to. -Stop fibbing. -[BIRDS CHIRPING] But I feel like talking with you. All day, night, evening and noon. -Just talking. -So go on. Your deep voice... it does something to my heart. So I'll keep talking. All my life. So much that you'll be fed up. You will call me from Mumbai, won't you? -Are you going to miss me there? -[CAR STARTS] You're the only girl I can never stop thinking about. The moment I've wrapped up daddy's business... I'll fly into your arms from Mauritius. Okay? -Bye. -Bye. I'm glad you went away to Mauritius. There's no tension with the police anymore. -Everything's under control. -Let's talk business. -Poddar Seth's company has closed down. -What happened? Same thing which is happening everywhere. From Bikaner's bhujia to Dehradun's basmati rice... from potato chips to the computer chips... multinationals are storming into every trade. Why're you playing a socialist? What do you want me to do? I'll explain. Peter, switch off the music. -Daisy, You can go. -[MUSIC STOPS] Poddar Seth needs a new formula of a medical drug to start another company. We've got to steal that formula from a multinational company. Why wait for me to pull off something so easy? -You could've done it on your own. -We couldn't have. This company has a very advanced security system. Ultra-modern. Very risky. ABBAS: The alarm will go off the moment we pick up the floppy. The police will take 2 minutes to get there... but the security guards will be there in 10 seconds. Only you can steal that floppy and escape in 10 seconds. -The money? -We've taken an advance. -We'll get the rest later. -The most important thing. You can't enter the company's record room through the door. You'll have to get in through the roof. Come. I'll explain to you. Suppose this is the record room and the safe is here... from a height of 150 feet, you will descend here. Laser beam traps are laid all over the floor. They aren't visible, but the moment you touch them, the alarm will go off. But these laser-beams can be seen through a smoke screen. So we need smoke cans. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BLINK SOUND] [ALARM BUZZING] [BACKGROUND MUSIC] [BEEP SOUND] [TYRES SCREECH] She makes me laugh sometimes, she makes me cry sometimes... she torments me so much. I miss that girl very much. Say something... don't be quiet. Just keep talking. Your voice... Forget about my voice and heed my heart. Missing you. Missing you too. I'll come back soon. Okay... Bye. Bye.

[MUSIC PLAYING] Liar! You didn't come to the airport to receive me. -Your daddy was coming there. -So what? -You could've met him too. -In his presence... could I have touched you like this? [LAUGHS] Strange guy you are, Ali! Rachit? -You guys... here? -For a cup of coffee, what else? Sapna? Ali, Abbas and Billu. -Hi. -Hi. We're good friends of Rachit. Come join us. -Sure. -[SIGH] Rachit, I must leave. I'll see you later. -Don't you like our company? -It's nothing of the sort. -Bye. -Bye... hey you left your coffee. -It's for you. -Oh! Thanks. Well...? Love? You didn't even introduce us properly to your girlfriend. We'd have said a few words in praise of you. You've given that girl the status of art! Looks like you haven't told her what you do for a living. Every time I told a girl, she fled! [LAUGHING] ABBAS: Love makes people talk. And you've become silent. ALI: Let's talk business. Look Rachit. It's going to be very crowded there, there will be a lot of security men. And the party's being held on the 20th floor. It's impossible for us to escape from there. What's gotten into you? -I'm not in the mood. -Where are you going? -Moods don't run the business. -I'm not in the mood, I told you. -I don't want to do it. -Relax, Ali. Chill out. Let's talk about it later. Let him go. -Something surely is fishy. -Isn't it? It's his girlfriend. You're through with talking, Rachit? And you said you could go on all your life. Well, Mr. Silent...? What's up? Sapna, I carry a burden on my heart. So give it to me. Your burden and all of your sorrows. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Sapna. I am a criminal. Ever since I was a child, I have been a thief. But I'm not using my poverty and helplessness as an excuse. I'm just a thief. RACHIT: Maybe you've become quiet because you hear me say this. Maybe you'll go far away from me in just a moment or two. RACHIT: I'm afraid to turn around and see. Even if you have walked away... RACHIT: I won't hold you guilty. But if you're still with me... RACHIT: I promise, I will give up everything. Everything. Promise? I've made up my mind. I'm giving up all this. Is that your decision or is it hers? That's none of your business. ALI: If you're in love, get married. That's a nice thing. We'll dance at your wedding. But there's a problem. If one of us commits the theft, he won't be able to escape. He'll get caught. And if he rattles on the names of anyone of us... the police could come to your house too. Your family will be ruined before it's made. -That's just what we don't want! -Now look... the necklace is worth 5 crores. Do it one last time. Once we have the money, we'll give up this profession too. We'll also get married. The last time? -Of course. -The last time! Done. -I'm glad he agreed. -Have you told him... the necklace has a computer chip with the army's secrets in it? As if he'd have agreed then! Before the chip is delivered to anyone else, it'll fall in our hands. And we'll sell it to the ISI at any price we wish. But the goose that lays the golden eggs is slipping out of our hands. -It won't. -Sapna will not be true for him. [CAR LOCKING SOUND] -This party is not boring at all. -No, absolutely not. Good fun. Thank you. I withdraw... [LAUGHS] -It's a grand party. -Yeah. You have a beautiful necklace. Really? Thank you. -What business are you into? -I run a diamond business. -Excuse me. -Sure. Gorgeous. Excuse me. I said... Gorgeous. -Thank you. -May I have the pleasure of a dance with you? By the way, I don't dance with just about anyone. Okay. -What's your name? -Mamta. James. Just James. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHATTING AND LAUGHING] -Excuse me. -Sure. It was a pleasure dancing with you. In which case, you will remember me for a long time to come. People think of me after I'm gone away more. Excuse me. Inspector Kadam CBI. Out with the necklace. Out with the necklace. Fast. Hold him... You wanted to give the ISI classified information about the Indian army! ISI? Bring these three guys along. Come on! [GROANING] [GUNSHOT] [POLICE SIREN WAILING] [HONKING] [VROOMING] [SCREAMING] [POLICE SIREN WAILING] [GASP] [INDISTINCT CHATTERS] [GASP] Sapna. Sapna. Sapna. -Sap... -[POLICE SIREN WAILING] Why do your friends Ali and Abbas want to kill me? -Ali, Abbas... -[GASP] -[BACKGROUND MUSIC] -[FLASH SOUND] INSPECTOR: Take the body to the hospital. Have him charged under TADA and locked away in the Elphinstone Jail forever. He'll rot in exile. Yes Sir. [GASP] We have another request. Our names mustn't be dragged into this case. Please Sir. [RATTLING] This is the Elphinstone Jail. In the last 150 years, not one prisoner has been able to run away from here. I see a rebellion in your eyes. But your lips are sealed. Maybe the onslaught of time has turned you dumb. And we have now clipped your wings. Don't ever try to escape from here. You'll either drop dead on the ground... or drown in the sea. Understand? [FOOTSTEPS] [ALARM BELL RINGING] He ran away! In just 2 months!! I know where he must've gone. [GROANING] [GROANING] Rachit. -[SQUEEZING] -[GROANING] [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIPPING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Sir... Madam. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Forgive me, although we don't know each other... but I do know of the love that lies hidden in your heart. For Rachit? [BIRDS CHIRPING] I think of the immense love he must've had for you... to lose his balance of mind? I don't want to listen to anything about him. You may leave. LAILA: I have nothing to do with people who break their promises. Please don't say that. I need your help. -I don't meet anyone. -I know... you're dead, as far as the world is concerned. Because you're from the CBI, I was compelled to... That's exactly why you must go to Rachit with me. No. [BIRDS CHIRPING] He won't turn you down. And we desperately need him in this mission. -I'm dead for him! -But he's dying every moment... -with your memories. -So tell him... -to light a pyre of the memories. -Even the smoke from the pyre... will be that of your love. Come with me just once. Let him see that you're alive. He'll come back to life... -and our mission will be successful. -Sorry, I can't help you! I implore you in the name of someone you must ever have loved. You will never tell him that I'm alive. Did you have to implore me in someone's name? Okay. Although she's no more... my love for her is still alive. And here, although she's alive... the poor man thinks his beloved is dead. Why're you wasting your time over such a man? He's lost to himself. What use will you have of him? -I want to take a chance, jailer. -Why take a chance for a man... -who's alive just by chance? -What does that mean? Be seated. -Every 12 hours, the man drops dead. -Dead? Doctor. Yes, every 12 hours, he suffers a fit. He sees only shadows everywhere. He then runs after them. He assaults anyone who comes before him. Out of control some times, he bangs his head against the wall. [RATTLING] -So how do you bring him under control? -With tranquillisers. Although these tranquillisers affect his memory. But he calms down instantly. What happens when the effect of the tranquilliser has worn off? Next dose. I didn't give him a dose, because you wanted to question him. Set him free. CONSTABLE: Sorry Sir. It's an order. AKRAM: Please leave all of you. AKRAM: Everyone here thinks you're good for nothing. But I think you can be of great use to me. I'm Akram Shaikh. From the CBI. Your name is Rachit, isn't it? You have two objectives in life. Both of them... cannot be accomplished unless you're out of prison. I can help you in getting out of jail... if you help me... to save the nation from a crisis. The Elphinstone Jail... does that ring a bell? It's now a tourist spot. But when it was a prison... no inmate could ever run away from it. Except one man. And that is you! In the waters under the jail, is a maze of tunnels leading to the shores. Only you know about them. You were the one who ran away from there. I want to use the same tunnel to get inside the jail. You will go with me, because... you will fulfil an objective if you leave with me. Two men are holding 213 people hostages in the prison. The two men are your friends. The brothers... Abbas and Ali. They've placed all the seven lakes in Mumbai in target of a deadly virus. If their demands are not met, along with Mumbai... they'll destroy the entire nation. I know, it'll make no difference to you. But if your enemies slip out of our hands this time... they'll have gone very far away from your reach. You'll never find a better opportunity of confronting them. Come with me and have your revenge. Okay, buddy. I forgot... your second objective. Your love. Love never dies, they say. And the way you loved her, only someone in love can understand. She left you and went away to a world of her own. But whichever world she lives in, you will meet her some day. And what will you say to her? That you were a criminal who served a sentence? Won't you do something that will make you rise in her esteem? So that she can say, no one has ever loved the way you have. I am proud of you Rachit. If you can fight a battle because you hate someone... you can fight it because you loved someone too. Or maybe for the crores who live in Mumbai. [CAR PASSING SOUND] Sir, can I ask one thing? Yes. Sir, you say big things in a small city. Without love, one can't be a poet. Sir, please tell. She hadn't love you... or she had loved and ditched you? She loved me but didn't ditch me. And for your kindest information young man. There is more sorrow in this world other than love. -Good night. See you buddy. -Bye Sir. "I'm in love with you" "But I can't express that" "I have a desire" "But I can't express that" "I know everything but still" "I am always with you" "I want you too" "It's hard to explain" "I have a desire too" "It's hard to explain" "I also can't live with you" "But how would I express to you" "I have many complaints too" "It's hard to explain" "I have a desire too" "But I can't express too" "I'm in love with you" "I accept that" "I'm in love with you" "I accept that..." -[SIGH] -[TYRES SCREECHING TO A HALT] It's hard to live without you. I miss you so much. SHEETAL: We want freedom. That is our birth right. SHEETAL: No one can snatch that right from us! SHEETAL: We were born in a free nation... and we will fight for our freedom. Hey little girl... you talk as if the mutiny of 1857 has begun again. You're in the habit of talking about the mutiny of 1857... -and the struggle of 1942, aren't you? -I'm your guide, after all. Listen you fraud! You can't hold us back by force! I love fighting girls. What is your name? -Sheetal. -Sheetal? Congratulations! You have just won your freedom! -Guards, open the door. -[INDISTINCT CHATTERING] -Welcome. -Thanks... But what about them? -You've won freedom only from them. Not from me. -[SHOUTING] -Leave me... -Ohh, Shut up... -[CLAMOURING] -Hey! SHEETAL: Let me go. -SHEETAL: Leave me. -Gopal. This one's been instigating everyone. I suggest, you keep her separately. Take her away. -Lock her up in the old wing of the jail. -Okay. -Who else wants freedom? -Let me go! Abbas, Chief Minister. [BEEP SOUND] -ALI: Hey C.M... -Who's this? -Your father! -Watch your language! Watch your manners. This is your mother speaking, son. They are maniacs. Call me a genius. Haven't we turned the heat on the whole of Mumbai? You remember the demands, don't you? -C.M.: Please mind your language. -Chewing my brains. Ali, you talk to him. -Hey, C.M. -Yes. -You remember the demands? -Yes. 1500 crores and a ship to leave. -But who's going to give you asylum? -There's just one nation... which gives asylum to the criminals of India. One country. You have 20 hours to go. So move fast. Fast. [SHOUTING] Get in! -You bastards. I'll kill you all. -Shut up! The walls in this cell are very weak. Scream, and they'll collapse on you. -Understand? -Come. Hey... get lost. -Thank you, Allen. -You're welcome. You look handsome. Time turns you into a savage, Time turns you human. We're all slaves to time. Because time is all powerful. Your face has changed today, your clothes will change soon... maybe your Times will change too. "Never have faith" "Never wait" "Never have faith" "Never wait" "Don't ever have boundless love for anyone" "Don't ever have boundless love for anyone" "Someone is faithful, someone is unfaithful" "Who knows what misdemeanour they commit" "In love, I have been heartbroken" "I have been deserted half way through the journey" "Don't ever express it" "Don't ever wait for him" "Don't ever have boundless love for anyone" "Don't ever have boundless love for anyone" -My suspicion was right, Sir. The ISI has hatched this conspiracy. -Yes. I've received a report from RAW too. ISI's Brigadier Rashid is behind all this. He's the one who tried the virus on a few of our prisoners. But our forces will give him a fitting reply. Don't worry. Go ahead and accomplish your mission. Wish you all the best. -Hail India, Sir. -Hail India. -Hello. -RASHID: Hello... Whose this? Akram, this is Brigadier Rashid calling from Pakistan. Quickly say what you've got to. Let Mumbai go to the dogs. You needn't worry about your job. As soon as Kashmir is freed, we'll appoint you the I.G. there. Allah-willing, Kashmir will soon be ours. Hey Rashid, stop dreaming. You've been fighting for Kashmir for the last 50-55 years. Has Allah ever helped you? No. You know why? Because even Allah wants Kashmir to be part of India. If not to us, listen to at least the will of Allah. Because of Allah I have telephoned to help a Muslim brother of mine. Why? Are there no Muslims in Pakistan anymore? Help them, Mr. Rashid. And if you think Pakistani's are not Muslims... it's a very sad thing. But if they are and you still want to help us here... people in your country will call you a traitor, Mr. Rashid... Not me! it's people of your country that call you Muslims traitors! Oh yes, there are some people here... who lecture us on patriotism every now and then. Like you lecture us on Islam all the time. Now look, Brigadier. My religion is Islam. But my motherland is Hindustan. And thus I salute Mother India... the one you want to bleed. Stop doing it. Else, we'll teach you a lesson the world will be left watching. We'll finish you for good. Over and out. At Sunset, we'll reach the prison. With high tide... we'll gain entry into the prison through the secret tunnels. With me will be this special force of commandos. And also Rahul Gupta, scientist of CDC. He will tell us about the virus that is loaded in the missile. -Mr. Gupta. -Yeah. Thank you. Well, Gentlemen. However close you get to the missile, whatever the emergency... do not even try to separate the virus from the missile. Which is why I'm going to with you. And remember... the slightest bit of carelessness on our part... could make the entire mission fail. It could affect the whole country. This virus is very dangerous. Any questions? Thank you. The moment the mission is accomplished, one of you... will have to light smoke-sticks to signal us. Otherwise we have to use our last option. -Akram, can Rachit recall something? -He will, Sir. The moment he sees the model, it'll all come back to him. Officer. Rachit. This is the jail you were held captive at. Try and recall how you escaped from there. [BACKGROUND MUSIC] [SIGH] Remember something? [HELICOPTER SOUND] Officer, here are Rachit's medicines. If he has another fit, give him these medicines. He will calm down immediately. Okay Sir, let's go. Hello? Sapna, this is Akram. You didn't go with me to meet Rachit. But I still want to thank you. You haven't told Rachit that I'm alive, have you? No, he still doesn't know that you're alive. This mission is so dangerous, there's no saying... whether he will even return alive. Rachit did not betray you, he only loved you. Because of that very love, he forgot the way to live... the way to speak. Hail India. Father. Don't worry. I have influence in the Prime Minister's office, my child. I'll do something. You guys have played a very big game. Now listen carefully. Bad news. Akram Shaikh, with 10 commandos, is coming to attack you. And there's good news too. Your old friend, philosopher... is coming to you to be your friend for a lifetime. Your guide. Be careful. Our old friend Rachit is coming. To fight against us. Really? In that case, we must welcome him. Isn't it the Rachit you guys often talk about? Before you finish him, do let me take a look at him. -No, no, no! -No, no, no! -Why not? -Because he's a lover. What if you fall in love with him? The two of us will be ruined. So we'll first kill him and then show you. After death. Yes. Sir. The helicopter has dropped the commando force... about 3 kilometres away from the jail. They're now moving towards the secret tunnels. [BACKGROUND MUSIC] Sir, our commandos have got into the Elphinstone Jail. The jail was made and destroyed several times. I don't know which map ought to be followed. Rachit can help us only if he remembers something. Sir, our commandos have got into the tunnel to the jail. -Really! -Sir. The cameras are switched on. You can take a look... but you won't be able to hear anything. [BACKGROUND MUSIC] Listen, check that side. Show me the map, Pradip. [BACKGROUND MUSIC] Laser camera. Can you guys see something? Be careful, Sir. There's a motion-sensor there. Give me the mirror. [BUZZING] I've got them. Come on, boys. Come on. Ali... Abbas... They've left the tunnel. Stay here, Rahul. And take care of Rachit. -Okay? -Okay. Okay brother, let's go. Careful... [GUNSHOT] [FIRING] [GROANING] [GROANING] Moron! Your government sent you here... and you came along chanting Hail India! When we set chanting out Hail India... -we only return victorious. -That won't happen from here though. -You'll get killed! -If we die... scores of others will stand up. If they are killed... millions of others will rise against you. -He's talking too much! -Make a sieve out of him! Akram Shaikh, your death is destined at our hands! And your death is also destined at someone's hands. Not me, but the One Above knows who. We're the Ones Above! Can't you see that? Now beg for your life! [LAUGHING] He's down on his knees anyway! [CONTINOUS FIRING] [GROANING] [GROANING] Looks like they were told beforehand about our commandos' attack. Sir, we've got signals from the second camera. Officer connect it. -He's still suffering. -So let him suffer. Are you guys thinking of shooting him? Here goes. Bastards. -Let's hunt Akram. -Let's go. [GASP] Do what you will. You can't run away from here. We're not running away. We're leaving... in a ship of your government, like their sons-in-law. Don't you know where we're going? Very well too. There's just one nation... where every terrorist from India is hailed and welcomed. But that nation is a paradise for Muslims like us! You're going to get kicked around in that paradise you're going to. Even in 1947, several people went across in search of their paradise. They were subjected to a lot of humiliation. That's what's going to happen to you too. Whatever happens to us over there, we hate the infidels in this country! [GROANING] Not Hindus, not Muslims... this country has a problem with traitors. [FIRING] [GROANING] [GUNSHOTS] I haven't killed you yet because you are a Muslim. But if you want to live, then talk to the C.M... and help us get 1500 crores. I will let you have 15000 crores instead of 1500 crores. But there's one condition. Don't go alone. You... have to take your partners with you, whose... religion is money and betrayal is their work. Whatever is their religion and creed maybe. Bastard, talks a lot. It's all over. Akram. It's paining a lot right? [GROANING] [FIRING] [SHOUTS] The only reason I am sad is... my first mission... -I am leaving that incomplete. -You'll be all right. You'll be all right. [WATER GURGLING] I think He is calling me. Someone is calling me from far away. -I am coming. -No. -Akram we will not be able to do anything. -No! Dont tell all this. Promise me. That, for the work for which we came here. We will complete that. They will not bring the doomsday on us. We will bring on them. Akram, Akram... Hey C.M. You have sent commandos here? I... I sent them to negotiate with you. With guns in their hands? Their guns spoke, so did ours. They're all dead-meat. ALI: Now see what we're going to do! [BACKGROUND MUSIC] Oh my God! Rachit. Rachit, they're going to kill us! Come on get up! They've got guns! We could lose our lives! Do you get what I'm saying, Rachit? I was crazy to come here to defuse the missiles! Defuse. I've had my fuse blown and you won't say a word! Say something... react! [SHOUTING] They were here. They've killed Akram Shaikh! The one who brought us here. He's gone away... and left us here! What am I going to do? RAHUL: Oh yes! You remember the way back! We'll go back the way we came from! RAHUL: I can't even remember a normal route, Rachit! Oh shit! UNKNOWN MALE: I've burnt Rachit to death. His ashes will now flow into the sea! Only his ashes will escape from this jail! Sir, there's a girl called Sapna who wants to meet you. She says she has permission from the P.M.'s office. -What am I to tell her, Sir? -Show her in. Okay Sir. There was a call from the PMO that a girl wants to see me. -She's the lover of the prisoner Rachit who has gone on the mission. -Okay. I am CBI Chief Khurana. Please tell me. Is Rachit all right? Yes, we're trying to establish contact. What does that mean? At the moment... those who have gone on the mission, are missing. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [WHEEZING] [WHEEZING] RAHUL: Rachit. Are you okay? [PANTING] What? What are you looking for? Looks like the effect of the medicine is wearing off. He's getting the fits again. Rachit? Oh shit! Medicine. First Officer. Any contact, any signal. Hurry up, try again. Sir, the scientist Rahul Gupta is right before Captain Pradip's camera. Oh my God. Give me headphone. Switch on the beep of the wireless! Tap it, please! [BEEPING] Hello. Hello, Rahul. -Who's this? -Khurana. CBI chief. Sir, how do you know that I've got the wireless? -The officer lying in front of you... -RAHUL: He's dead, Sir. there's a camera fixed on his shoulder... through which I can see you. Remove the camera from his shoulder and fix it on yours. Come on, Hurry up. Sir. They've all been killed, Sir. Only Rachit and I are alive. I know all the commandos have been killed. A traitor has leaked information to them. Look... now, you and Rachit have to complete this mission. No, Sir... CBI CHIEF: Come on you both can do it. The two of you can complete the mission! -Do not lose your nerve! -Sir... Rahul, look up... There's someone standing right in front of you! Look up. Sir. When death stares you in the face, you have only two options. Either surrender or take him on. Come on, you can do it. You can take him on. -[FIRING] -[SHOUTING] [PANTING] [CLANG] Oh no. Medicine. Sir. Hurry up and get to Rachit. Yes Sir. Rachit! Get up! Come to your senses! Only the two of us are left! Rachit get up!! Please get up Rachit... Rachit! [PANTING] Rachit! It's very important for Rachit to regain consciousness. On him depends the success of our entire mission. But how are we going to sit here and bring him back to his senses? There must be some way out. Sir. Sir, I can help you. I can have a word with Rachit. You are right. -Come here... Give her head phones. -Head phones. Talk to him! Go on! Speak. Speak go ahead. Rachit. Rachit... Rachit, this is Sapna. Are you listening, Rachit? Rachit... I'm alive, Rachit. Nothing has happened to me, Rachit. SAPNA: I'm here in the control-room. Only for you. SAPNA: Only for you, Rachit. I went far away from you, didn't I? I'll never do that again. SAPNA: You can give me any punishment you wish to. [SOBBING] Come back for once at least Rachit. Just once! I want to live again... in your eyes, in your arms, Rachit. I'll wait for you. I'm going to wait for you. I'll break every boundary in my love for you, Rachit. Stand up, Rachit. Rise and destroy those... who have betrayed not just you, they have betrayed the nation too! [GUNSHOT] Rachit! [CONTINOUS FIRING] [BACKGROUND MUSIC] -[CONTINOUS FIRING] -[GROANING] [EMPTY PISTOL CLICKING] [GROANING] [CLANG] [GROANING] Man. You do it. The CBI director says the two of us can complete this mission. RAHUL: I got the map. Look. RAHUL: There are three missile stations here. But which one is the closest, I don't know. You'll have to... Rachit... RASHID: The General is very happy with you. The way you have finished the commandos... he has decided to reward you with 500 crores. Thank you. Thank you. Tell the General that we will finish anyone who stands in our way. Before the Indian government makes another move... we'll put the pressure on them. We'll scare them a bit more. ALI: In a few hours, we're reaching your country. God protect you. [GUNSHOT] ABBAS: Let me fire a missile on Mumbai! ABBAS: Only then will the C.M. send the money. Rascals. -Abbas, what are you doing? -[TYPING SOUND] I'm going to put the whole of Mumbai to eternal sleep! -I only asked you to threaten them! -I've said what I had to. Ali. -Gopal, let the missile go. -Let's do it. Abbas, hold it! -Gopal, Don't touch the Machine. -No Touching. -Gopal, let go of the other missile. -Right on. Do what you want to. I'm hurling a missile at them. -I'll kill you! -Ali! Try killing me! [GUNSHOT] Damn it. Come on baby, quick... Right. Okay, where is Hindustan (India)... Right. Good girl. That's Mumbai... -Are we ready to... -All initiation systems are ready. 30 seconds and counting... -We are ready to launch... -Good. [ALARMING] Yes! Sir, they've fired a missile from Elphinstone Jail. What? What have you done! What fear or bargaining power do we now have! That C.M. wasn't sending us the money! He'll send it now. We won't get the money anymore. The damage has been done. We've contaminated their lake. All our efforts have gone in vain! -Now what? -All over. -Have you gone out of your mind? -You guys were out of your minds. -I kept my nerve. -Kept your nerve, my foot! I let the missile go, but I took out the virus. -I've fired a blank missile! -What? So you fired a blank missile? Yes. Because the virus isn't a bullet you can fire at will. The virus is priceless. It's worth billions. Like me! We're saved! We're saved, Laila! -Gopal, you're a genius. -That I am... We are saved. Abbas, don't ever do that again, brother. Don't call me brother. You fired at me! Out of love, brother. Don't be angry with me. Okay come on guys. Shake hands. Okay give me a kiss. You aren't angry with me, are you? Come on give me a kiss. Let's embrace, brother. ABBAS: C.M., did you see the power we wield? We wanted to undo the loincloth you wear, not make you wet it. Which is why we didn't load the missile with the virus. They had taken out the virus from the missile. -Hello. -Hello. Now tell us how many hours you have left. -Eighteen. -Wrong! 10 hours. C.M.: Why? You tried to act smart by sending those commandos. -So soon, how am I... -Eight hours. -Listen to me, please... -Six hours. -Four! -Let me try. Two! Listen... -One. -Listen. -Want us to fire the missile? -No, no! So let's settle at five hours. 1500 crores and a ship. ALI: Remember, we're really mad. ABBAS: If you ruin our mood, we'll put the whole of Mumbai to sleep. Okay, I'll meet all your demands in five hours. All right? -What's happening, Sir...? They're dropping missiles on Mumbai? -[CAMERA CLICKS] -In the lake at Powai which provides drinking water? -Hold... -I'm going to answer all your questions. -What is this? It was an exercise on the part of the defence ministry. It was an army exercise. Why didn't you inform the public well in advance? Many things the press get to know even before the government does. -How did you miss out on this one? -You're the one who missed out, Sir! -No more questions. -No Sir... -That's all. -Please tell Sir... [CLAMOURING] [GROANING] What. [GROANING] I can't believe this is the place where they have kept the missiles. This is the compartment in which the virus is loaded. Rachit, don't move. Let me concentrate. We have to be very careful. This is where the virus is. One mistake could ruin everything. Shekar, come in... I need some silence. [GASP] Here's the virus in its hyper concentrated bio-chemical matrix form. This is the deadly virus. One down. Now for the next. No one's responding from the ammunition room. That's where the missiles are. -Go and check it. Fast. -Okay. ABBAS: Come in Shekar... Without this chip, they can't use the missile. [GROANING] [GROANING] -[EXPLOSION] -[GROANING] [RUMBLING] [RAHUL GROANING] Ohh! My leg! Rachit? RAHUL: Oh God! RAHUL: Where are we landing... [INDISTINCT] Follow them! Rachit... Oh my God! Where are we going? -Where will this take us Rachit? -[FIRING] RAHUL: Rachit, they're firing! Do something! Rachit, please help me. [BLABBERS] [CONTINOUS FIRING] RAHUL: Indistinct. We'll meet with an accident, Rachit! RAHUL: Oh my God! Do something Rachit! [SHOUTING] -Help! -[SCREAMING] -You, Sheetal?! -Rahul! -Rachit! -Sheetal! You? Sheetal, you, I... I kept calling you like hell and here you are! They kidnapped me, stupid! That's all right. But what are you doing here? I'm on a picnic! I told you, didn't I? But what are you doing here? I... I'm here on a secret mission. You came to save me? Yeah. You came to save me! My God! He is with me. Rachit... Rachit, this is my girlfriend Sheetal. And this is Rachit, a bit of a snob. We have very little time. This is the map. Rachit, look here. Two more missile stations left. One in the library, one in the tower. Now which one is closer, I don't... Yes. Laila, Rachit is alive. Tell me something. Why've you tied a red handkerchief on your mouth? Strange man. Neither does he talk, nor will he let me talk. Funny guy. You tell me. Do I talk too much? -Oh no. Where do you talk at all? -Exactly. I wonder what he thinks. -That's a toy gun, isn't it? -You think it's a toy gun? It's a real one. -I don't believe it. -What you don't believe it. Watch this. -[GUNSHOT] -[SCREAMING] Saw that. Where are you guys headed...? Has the money arrived? SHEETAL: Guns, missiles... what's going on over here? Someone's coming. Move. -From behind, or towards the front? -In the front... back there, Rachit... where's Rachit? Give me the gun and tell me how it works. You go and stand there. Sheetal. [SCREAMING] Have you gone mad? Don't ever point a gun at anyone okay. Go hide. [GUNSHOT] [CLACKING] Rahul! What's he doing here? He must be the one who decoded the missile. Shoot him. Before he gets to the other missiles, let's gun him down. [GROANING] [SCREAMING] ABBAS: Hey Romeo! What have you come here for? Brother... I made a mistake. I ought to have bumped him off with his Sapna! I made a mistake! A bloody mistake! [LAUGHING] He has come here to die! You... Abbas! Run Ali! [SCREAMING] [CLACKING] [SCREAMING] -You are terrific. -[SPLASH] -Fantastic. -Okay. Shit... Laila here. Laila, we've buried Rachit. You can shut the tunnel from the other side now. So that they don't even come across his soul. Yes. Gopal. Grenade. I've pulled out the pin. Toss it at them quickly. [PANTING] I have done it. Anything else. I will be there. What a bombshell! I must take her out on a vacation! We have either lost the signals, or the camera is damaged. We have to wait and watch. This is no technical glitch. The two of them have been killed. When an officer like Akram Shaikh was felled... with outstanding commandos of the nation... -what will these two clowns do? -Mr. Home Minister. Whatever your name is. Maybe you don't know my Rachit. -He can fight any power on Earth. -That's your love for him speaking. Yes, my love possesses his soul. And it won't let him die. There's no jail on Earth from which he cannot escape. History is witness to that. Rachit, they've blocked all the ways through the tunnels. Come with us! Shit! The path this way is blocked too! We're trapped! We're going to die here! No one's coming here to our rescue! Why did you come here? Even if I were dead... at least you'd have lived! Our love would have lived on through you! I'm suffocating! I'm going to die! Do something, someone! Somebody help! -God. Somebody, help! Please... -Just shut up! Nothing's happening to us! Just relax. Relax okay? It's loaded. I just loaded it. RAHUL: Gunpowder? What are you going to do with it? [BACKGROUND MUSIC] -Oh Sheetal! -[SCREAMING] [INDISTINCT] Man! You're too good. Rachit, go to the tower. I'll meet you there after I've defused the rest of the missiles. Come on. What are you waiting for? Let's go. -Talk about this to first... -[TELEPHONE RINGING] We haven't been able to establish contact! What are waiting for? Just pay them if you want to save the lives of millions! Dollars, Pounds... give them whatever they ask for! Must we give you your share or will you take it from them? What? -CBI CHIEF: Your pawn has told us everything. -[TELEPHONE RINGING] In any case, Akram had prepared a pretty comprehensive file on you. Half an hour to go and the money still hasn't arrived. Something is surely wrong. We're going to make the government's plans go wrong now. Yes, everything is in place. We've made arrangements to jam the signals of all TV and radio channels. You are the only ones who will now feature on every radio and TV channel. [BACKGROUND MUSIC] [HUFF] -[FIRING] -[GROANING] You are on air now. [TV NEWS] A 49 year unidentical... Mumbai's under threat. So is the rest of India. -I'm Ali. -I'm Abbas. In exactly 30 minutes, the people in Mumbai will take their last breath. Because your government does not care for you. If the government does not meet our demands in half an hour... we will fire the missile at Mumbai! The missile is loaded with a deadly virus. Which will kill you and the whole city, in a matter of a few minutes... Oh My God. This is not just... Listen, halt the transmission of all TV and radio channels immediately. Tell the cable operators to suspend their services till further notice. It's such a deadly virus that whichever city it is dropped in... not even an animal is born for 150 years, let alone a human being. 213 people, we have... No, point guys. Looks like the government has blocked all the TV channels. That's all right. Our job is done. Mumbai must've gone berserk! [CLAMOURING] [BELL TOLLING] [PANTING] Come on. [SCREAMS] Bloody bull! [GRUNTING] Rahul... -Leave him. -[SCREAMING] [YAWPS] [GRUNTING] -[SIREN WAILING] -[VEHICLES HONKING] [CLAMOURING] Allah, Abbas and Ali are blowing up Mumbai. As long as there is Haji Ali in Mumbai, no harm can be done by Abbas and Ali. You're dominating every channel these days. Thanks. It's all because of your patronage. Even we have not been able to scare the Indian administration so much. Get to the naval border as soon as you have completed your work. I'll personally come to receive you there. -[PANTING] -Yes. Come here son, they have sent someone like you to stop me?! Rahul. [GUNSHOT] [GROANING] I told you Gopal never ever use science for destruction. But, girls are still up there. Right? -[TELEPHONE RINGING] -[SIGH] I'll issue orders to the Air Force to blow them up. I can't risk the lives of millions for the sake of just 213 hostages. ALI: Laila! ALI: Rachit. [GROANING] I'll stop him! Go and fire the missile! Hey...! [FIRING] Ali you launch the missile, I will stop him. -[FIRING] -[SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [GROANING] No, no... you can't fire at me. The moment you shoot, Ali will let go of the missile! [SHOUTING] [GRUNTING IN PAIN] This is a go ahead order. For Operation Elphinstone. Yes. Go ahead. -Drop the gun or I will shoot. -Okay... -Leave him. -[SCREAMING] Hey Rachit! Leave Abbas, or else I will kill this scientist. I will kill him. -Leave Abbas, or else I will kill him. -No Rachit. Don't worry about me, kill her. -I said leave him. -I am fed up of these blackmailers. Sometime they hijack a plane, sometimes they bomb blast and sometimes they mix poison in water. -Don't leave him Rachit, just kill him. -I said leave him. Laila... my Laila... Laila saved me, but what will happen to you? You are dead, you are dead and will go where Sapna is now. Rachit. Kill Abbas and his brother and let me die! [GROANING] Are you mad? You really shot me but I was just... I was just... Sheetal. Are you okay? Mission Elphinstone abort. [BACKGROUND MUSIC] [SCREAMING] [GROANING] Bloody thief! You're taking sides with the cops? When it's a question of India and Pakistan... every Indian is on one side. You're in a hurry to go to Pakistan, aren't you? Your brother and Laila wanted to go there too. Laila. You're going there too. Bastard! I see smoke signals. They are still alive! They've given us a smoke signal. What? -Abort the mission. -Roger! Well done boys. Bless you, dear. All the best. -Any news of Ali and Abbas? -No, Sir. Indian Air Force? Dear citizens of Mumbai, your Mumbai is totally safe now. The two terrorists Abbas and Ali have been decimated... their missiles and the virus have been destroyed... Mumbai is like the Mumbai of old. Beautiful Mumbai, our Mumbai. Hail India. Rachit is now a free man. Go on. Live happily. Rachit, I made a grave mistake in understanding you. I am sorry. I didn't keep my promise. I am sorry. Look... in this route... Hold on! Wait! Stop! Move. You scoundrel. Here's the scoundrel! Why did you make a cripple out of me? What are you looking at. Why did you shoot me? -I only tried to save your life. -What do you mean... He speaks! He can really speak! -Sheetal, he talks! I didn't know... -Yeah, he talks! Friends?
