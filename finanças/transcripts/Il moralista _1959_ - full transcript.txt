Two lives, I live for you. I hear two voices in me. If I'm talking about ideals, if I'm talking about virtue, don't believe me. They are bullshit, words and nothing more. Don't trust me because I'll cheat on you. Moralist, you can tell me what morality is. It is a fable for the simple, but I did not make it. I argue, I stigmatize, and I condemn the whole world. Oh what a scandal! Don't trust me because I'll cheat on you. Moralist, you can tell me what morality is. It is a hoax for the simple, but I did not do it. No no, no no, no no, I didn't do it! It's not pretty! It is not done. It's not right, it's not. Where is the moral? Don't trust me because I'll cheat on you. Moralist, you can tell me what morality is. It is a hoax for the simple, but I did not do it. No no, no no, no no, I didn't do it! - Outside! Long! Closes! - But what are you pushing! - Ahead! - But do you have a warrant? - What does it say? - So what do you want? - Home to study! - Why are you arresting us? - Let's go! - Did you want to lock me inside? - What were you doing in the premises? What was he doing? He played billiards. What scandal has happened so that the premises close to me? - I neither know nor should I know. - You see it yourself ... They are all boys who play pool and play the record player. - Also the one that has come out before? - I don't pay attention to who goes out and who goes in. - Damn record player! Excuse me, Commissioner. - Please. I pay 220 thousand lire in tributes every two months, and I have the restored premises from recently. If it makes me close, what do I do? - I'm sorry, but I'm following orders. - What is the cause of this measure? You must know, dear sir, that against your local more than 3,000 signatures from mothers have been collected . Three thousand mothers against me? Now I refuse. - But where is he going? - Now comes this one. Come come! - I'm the owner's wife! - It's okay. - Giovanni, what is it? - We have 3,000 mothers against us! - Is the lady the wife? - Yes. - Show me the documentation. We are not married, but we have lived together for so long that it is as if we were. - What is that of the 3 thousand mothers? - It's what I'd like to know. Who has collected the signatures? - The Organization of Public Morality. - As? If the general secretary, Menegotti, came to the premises and gave his approval. - Mr Menegotti has returned to France, he has been replaced. - By whom? - By another secretary general. - And how is it? - Is it treatable? I don't know him personally, but when he's around, I can't sleep. He pawns me many cases. Now if you don't mind, you should come for other data Of the high honor attributed to me, I am certainly not worthy. "I'm not worthy." But if modest is my person, not modest is ardor who does the job recently conferred on me as Secretary General of the International Organization "Moralité Publique", Italian section, an incorruptible torch that does not fear the storm, indeed, it provokes it. Friends... - Someone has dared to deliver ... - Will this speech last long? - He's been talking for an hour. - Can we talk to the president? He is also in the living room. It is also useless, the general secretary is the one who takes care of everything. - In the days of Mr. Menegotti ... - Yes, it was different. - But after all the speech, won't you leave without receiving us? - No! As soon as the ceremony is over, go back to work. This one is not kidding. He is the first to arrive and the last to leave. We are not surprised in the dream. To win a battle, it is necessary to know the enemy and do not underestimate it. And do you know who this enemy is? It's the multiform monster! The octopus with a thousand tentacles! Leave it, all theater. Then in person, it 's something else. I have met many like that. ... or the fashion that induces to provoke even more feminine forms? - Mrs. Baroness. - Can we speak to the secretary general? Yes, your visit is already announced. - The man told me to make them pass after the speech. - Thank you. - Thanks again everyone, but the party is over. - Congratulations. Let's get back to work. Let's not forget the obligations of our mission. Thank you. Thank you. - Long live the new secretary! - And thanks for the silence! Again a bravo to our Agostino! Where is? He has immediately returned to work. He has begged for maximum silence. Oh yeah? Okay, let's listen to him. Obey. - Good Morning. - Good Morning. - Come in. - Right away, Mr. Secretary General. Come in, Mr. Baroness, you can come in. - Good morning, Mr. Secretary. - Dears, come in. You are part, if I am not mistaken, of the Commission for the campaign against the Hula-hoop, right? No, I am also part of that commission, but right now we are dealing with the withdrawal of the cartel. See, nothing escapes me. The poster is already on the order of the day, but you have to be specific. What have we done specifically? - We have collected 3,800 signatures against the cartel. - Let's see. - All fathers and mothers. - Well, this document is extremely importance because it allows me to come into direct contact for the kidnapping of the film. Very well. Thank you. But it is necessary to try to obtain, if possible, 5,000 signatures. - Sure, we'll get it. - Good. Thank you, goodbye. Baroness, step up the fight against the Hula-hoop by all means. - Stay calm. - Thank you! Very well! Bye! Miss, come in. Hurry up - Good morning, Eleonora. And your grandmother? - Not bad, thank you .. - Write. Note films, OIMP Organization. Ahead! Good Morning. As soon as the organization's newsletter issues ...I'm with you. - Please. List? "The devil and the flesh": Obscene and sinful. "A bullet for Joe": Silly and violent. - "A naked woman". Please! - Have you seen her? Needless. Out, out Disgusting and annoying. "The first woman": Absurd and controversial. "Come home, Lassie": Highly educational. "Cheese, love and fantasy" and "Topolino": Idem. Send it right away, Eleonora. - Come? - Yes. - Interesting, right? I did it myself. They report on morality in the world. This one for example shows the rise of the striptease, in America and in Europe. Terrifying figures of Eva's daughters undressing in public. - In private, unfortunately, we can not control it. - Unfortunately... This is about the increase in publicity through sex. - A mouth that uses a toothpaste provokes morbid thoughts. - Clear. Not to mention swimsuits, bras, garters ... ... or other, let's say ... hygienic appliances. - Hygienic, he said! Do you want to sit down? This shows the impressive synthesis of lust ... ... that is unleashed through dances like rock 'n roll and cha-cha. How can I help you? I do not have the pleasure of meeting you, because I have recently held this position. - It is simply your opinion on this poster. - Sit down. I listen to them. - A cigarette? - Thank you. - It allows? - No! I am at your disposal. We would not want the case to be repeated that mothers of families step in and make us remove the poster. - I am here to advise, not to hinder. - Thank you. - This is the poster. - What product is it? - From a beauty cream. - Excuse my ignorance, ... where is the cream applied? - In the face. - In the neck... And what does the navel have to do with it? The navel has been exposed. To get a little attention. - For me everything is fine, but remove the navel. - As? - Cover the navel. - But we will have to redo everything, the poster, the tubes, the creams. - It's millions of lire ... - You have asked me for advice and I have given it to him. Cover the navel. His predecessor, Mr. Menegotti, liked the navel sign. I'm surprised that Mr. Menegotti liked the belly button. Secretary, we reached an agreement with Menegotti . - Our company already gave you a small gift. - Menegotti? -Yes. For the final approval, our admón. it is allowed to give ... 300 thousand. For Mr. Menegotti, but he has been transferred abroad, now I am. All right, you keep it. Menegotti got 300 thousand , 300 thousand you, so the poster passes and everything is fixed. Would you be willing to testify in front of a judge that Menegotti accepted the 300 thousand lire? - Testify? Why? - Ignore what we said. And besides, there is no proof. Is there no proof? Well, nothing is fixed, friend. Post your poster, And I'll make my recorder talk I'm going straight my way like a sword! - You don't want to get us in trouble? - Before the nobility of the mission, ... I wouldn't even recognize my brother. - But Mr. Secretary, ... has to adapt to the times. Make it 500 thousand. Shall I call the guards? Hopefully you think about it, but we will post the poster. I will love to see it. Congratulations to your company. Move on to the next. Immediately Mr. Accompany the lady. - Miss, please come. - Is incredible! It can? Please. I congratulate you on your film, a remarkable performance. But you have been so cruel. Why have you objected to my film? I have not opposed, I have only advised against it. How is it possible that a young man like you, modern, nice ... Can you advise against a scene where there is nothing wrong? - There is nothing. There's a lot. - But no. - Let me recreate the scene for you. - Yes! - I am in my room. - Yes. - I sit at the foot of the bed and I look intently at Giorgio, whom I love. But Giorgio is a cold boy, a little shy. So to wake him up I use my woman weapons. - I lift my skirt a little. -Yes. And since Giorgio doesn't react, I move closer. I put my hands on his back, I narrow my eyes and invite him to kiss me. Let's skip the kiss and move on. - I lie down on the bed. - Yes! So. He approaches, embraces me passionately, ... kisses me ... - Yes. - With my hand I unzip. - Good. Does it seem little? But while I uncover my back, the fade comes, the scene ends. I admit that intercourse is not seen, but in the next scene a child is seen in the cradle. So what happened between you and Giorgio during the cast? It's my first film, my whole career depends on it . If they take it out of circulation ... I don't have great acting skills, but mother nature has endowed me with a physique ... If you fail me, what do I do? Enroll in the Academy of Dramatic Art, study. Train yourself by studying and I will wish you the best of luck in your career. - Very well! - Agostino! Can you come for a moment? You call me Mr. President. Enroll in the Academy. Here I am, Mr. President. But didn't we say up to mid-calf? This is what I suggested to the costume manager at the ballet. Mid calf, up to here. One foot below the knee. Obviously there has been an error. I wanted to say a span on the knee. So the exact term was mid-thigh. - Didn't I say half thigh? - No, calf. - Curious. - Sometimes I think I say one thing ... - And instead, he says another. - Exactly. What's more, I'll tell you that I'm worried about the speech I have to make ... at the Monaco congress. - Will you, Mr. President? I got 3 o'clock tonight writing the speech for Monaco. - It's a perfect start. - Shall we read it together? It is not necessary, you know that I trust you more than I trust myself. - This morning I tied the handkerchief ... - And you don't know why? - No. 4:45 PM, Ciampino airport? Did I have to go receive some personality? - His daughter. - My girl! Virginia! Do you know her? - In a photo dressed as a Little Italian, she was that tall. - Already. Now it is not that it has grown much. Have you never seen her in person? - As? He has always lived abroad. - I hadn't thought about it. I want to show you the last photo they took of him in London. With pleasure, Mr. President. - Beautiful! - Does she look pretty to you? - Magnificent, beautiful, healthy! - But this neckline ... Is it worn like that in England? - No, that's not my daughter. I was already saying. Who? A poor girl, a case that I take care of personally. - I understand, Mr. President. - This is my little girl. Another beauty, more spiritual, lively eyes, loyal. - Lucky whoever marries her. - You have put your finger on the yaga, Virginia is 29 years old and has not yet met love. You will find a young man capable of arousing you the feelings that are the basis of the institution of marriage. - Have you never thought about getting married? - Yes, but it's not easy. Like a girl, also the man who wants to start a family ... ... is frightened of modern prejudice. Do I think wrong? - I want you to meet my daughter. - I would never have dared to ask you. Why don't you have dinner at home tomorrow? We will celebrate your return. - Too much honor, that's why I would never have dared. - It's a pleasure for me. - What time is dinner? - At 9. - I'll be punctual. - See you tomorrow. - At 9. Jimmy and I were engulfed in fog on the Scottish Islands. We found a refuge, a small and comfortable chalet with a single room and a single bed. Naturally, we sleep together. In the same bed? Yes, in the same bed. - Why are you surprised? - But I'm stunned. - Now you have to tell me everything. What happened? - Nothing. How is it possible? In a chalet lost in the woods, at night ... in the same room, in the same bed, and nothing happened? President, he was an Englishman. Ah, the English are "gentlemen" up to that point? They dominate themselves. From childhood they are trained in self-control. In fact, in my six years in England, always alone on the streets of London, in the countryside, in a swimming pool in a bikini ... ... you won't believe it, but no one would turn to look at me. - I do not doubt it. Oh my son, how much work we have left in this regard in our country. The statistics are terrifying. Indeed, here when I go down the street, I feel attacked by the stares. Looks that penetrate, that undress ... I have the impression of walking naked. It must be terrible for a woman to feel continually attacked. No, actually I'll tell you that I don't dislike him at all. I don't want to miss "Double or nothing". Let's go? - Please sit down. - Thank you. - Whiskey? - No thanks, I don't drink alcohol. Ah, he doesn't drink alcohol. - So you want an orangeade? - No, the orangeade at night is full. - Why do you comb your hair like this? - A childhood scare. - For real? - I was joking. - Was your mother blonde? - How do you know? - Blue eyes. - Thank you. Do you know that I would be afraid to find myself alone with you in a bedroom? Completely absurd hypothesis. I've never been in a bedroom with a woman and I will never be before marriage. Am I doing well? In England I have learned to respect everyone's ideas. When Philip the Fair entered Anagni with his troops, committed an act of arrogance against a pope. Who was such a pope and in what year did the episode occur? A funny question! The pope was Boniface VIII that he was arrested at Anagni by Philip IV the Fair in 1303. - Bravo, Agostino! - Thank you. How many potatoes named Anacleto have there been and what difference is there between two of them? Attention, Mr. Gnoccarolo, you have 60 seconds to reply. Easier and easier. There have been two popes named Anacleto. Anacletus I, appointed pope in 77 AD Anacleto II, in the Pierleoni century, from a converted Jewish family, 1930-31. - Agostino, you blow me away! - Thank you. - The contest does not fall. - Why don't you enter the contest? Virginia, always joking. Augustine is destined for a bright future. - Unfortunately, you only have one obstacle, modesty. - Bravo! - Shall we go out a bit? - Go out? Where? We are in Rome. A big city, let's have a little fun. - But it's 10. - So we go to a nightclub. - Sir, give me a hand. - Unfortunately, I can't do anything for you. - It's 10 o'clock, work awaits me. - How bland you two. - I hope we see each other again. - I accompany you. - Excuse me. My God! Work at night! - Goodnight. - You can not be here, parking is prohibited. I wait for my boss. He won't be long, he said at 10, and he's never late. It's okay. I am very upset, Virginia, by the speech you have made. - What did I say wrong? - Useless occurrences! - Especially in front of Agostino. - I don't think I've shocked him. Because he is very polite. But I know what he thought of you and I dislike him. Because a girl, a man like that does not find it easily. Less bad. A cigar, a tireless worker. Did you hear where I was coming back? Back to work. I do not care? You know that for me it is a matter of "skin". I don't want anything other than to leave you in the hands of a good man ... and with Agostino I am safe. - Good dad. I'll try to keep you happy ... but in separate rooms. - With those hairs! - We'll comb his hair, honey. - Thank you daddy. Listen, I've been trying to talk to the secretary general for days. - What do I do, break down the door? - I have precise orders not to let him in. Legs and arms. Say, this is the Secretary General of the OIMP. Who? - It's me, Virginia. - My dear Virginia, If you only knew how glad I am to hear your voice while I'm here ...working. - It was my duty to thank you ... ... for such beautiful flowers. - For charity, it was my duty. The welcome among us from an old friend. - You have been very kind. - I don't know if you like tulips. I prefer them to other flowers because in its color you can contemplate the beauty of nature ... without the danger of being stunned by the smell. - Already. They are very decorative. - It was Dad who told me to phone him. - Do you have orders to give me? No, to prepare something for tonight. I get bored and don't know anyone. If you knew someone else, wouldn't you have called me? For charity, sir. It is that not knowing anyone I am obliged to ask them to dedicate ... a bit of your precious time. - I'm happy to dedicate it to you. Tell me, I am at your service. I am all yours. - So what do we do? - I do not know. I am in your hands. You are in grave danger. Do you want us to go to the movies? Hopefully. There are so many good films that I have not seen in London. We will choose a suitable one for you. I'll go pick her up at 9. All right, I agree. Sorry if I disturbed you. Hearing your voice is always a pleasure. Bye. The mail to sign, Mr. Secretary General. Bring me the full billboard list. I go to the cinema. Also, if you talk to the president, you're wasting your time. - Because it is the general secretary who decides. - Then announce me. - Secretary General, billiard again. - Say my name. - Let it happen. - Ahead. - Thank you. Have the billboard. "Cinderella", "20,000 leagues under the sea" ... - Ahead. - Thank you. Excuse me? - Yes? I found it. - "As you move, I glare at you" - Sit down. - Thank you. Say it. Excuse me, I have the impression that we know something about each other. It can, I receive a lot of people. No, let me think. In 1949 you were not in Lugano? I have never been to Switzerland. Reason for your visit? Allow me another question. Do you know a certain Wanda the Captain ... that she lived with a certain Pippo ... - I don't know her, least of all Pipo. Well I assure you that maybe a long time ago, we met and maybe we were friends. He does not fool me. If you have come for your place, there is nothing to do. No, I say it because I am convinced. Anyway, why are you raging against my premises so much? It is not me who is cruel. It allows? Against your premises there are 10 thousand signatures of mothers of families. Someone will goad them. Could you not intervene? Go against the mothers of families? You are naive. But why are these mothers opposed to my local when there is ... many others that what a ... - Yes? - Tell me the names. - Tell me about the competition? - If you want me to take care of it, let me know. - Then write. White Kat. White Kat. Tavern. Tavern. Escriba. The Tivoli. Tivoli. Lobster. - Lobster. - Banana Boat. Banana Boat. - What's so strange about these places? - Everyone knows. Just look at the sign, a woman who undresses. And more! - Mr. Salvi. - Good night Miss. - Is the President watching TV? - Dad is out. - I had a meeting. - How strange, I manage. Thursday friday and saturday. Today is Wednesday, no meeting. He must have told me a little lie to leave us alone. - Sit down. - Thank you. - Miss, do you need me? - You can not go away. Is your sister coming tonight? - Yes thanks. Good night Miss. Mr. - What does? Is it really leaving? - No, he's going to the station. All excuses for not working. Perhaps he also understood that we wanted to be alone. In this case my duty would be to retire. Do you know that you have antediluvian ideas? In England many times my "boyfriend" would go up to my room even after 3pm. We had a little whiskey together ... And nothing bad ever happened. There is no wonder, the English are very frigid. - It's a matter of self-control. - Up to a point. The burning fireplace, a Sinatra record , a little too many whiskey ... You can lose control. Luckily I don't like whiskey, and I don't like American songs. Do you always judge pleasures so harshly? I always avoid things that bother me. But tonight you have to have a sip of whiskey. Just a little bit to please her. - How he feels now? - Exactly like before. What do we do? Are we going to the movies to have fun? Preferiría este "slow". - You have a sense of rhythm. - My father played the double bass. Family of artists. My father played nightclubs. I have spent my childhood in the "tabarín". That is why I abhor certain environments and I decided to fight them to the bottom. - Do you know that I am beginning to understand you? - At the age of six I lost my mother. He ran away from home with a conjurer to Santa Fe. How the Charleston dances! Wonderful! Where have you learned it? As a child, I have already told you that my father played the double bass. You know this suggests a wonderful plan to me . Come! Slowly. Excuse me. Ah, you again. I already told you yesterday that you can't park. - You're right, I'm waiting for my boss. - And I give him a fine. Documentation. Regards to Mr. Agostino. - Alt! Stop, we have arrived. - Excuse me Miss, but where do you want to go? - Let's Dance. - And you want to take me to dance to the White Kat? - Why, does he have a bad reputation? - Miss, let's go where you want, ... but let's not go into this place. - As you like. Well, let's go to the night Can Can, the Banana Boat, the White Cat ... It is enough that you can dance. I will not lead him to perdition. - Mr. Agostino, where are you going? - We haven't decided yet. - You don't want to go into these places? - I am not, it is she who wants. - But he can not. - Mr. Agostino is big enough to decide alone. Miss, in my position I can't do everything I want. Agostino, couldn't we talk for a moment without ... this one? Upset? Speak freely, do I miss it? Eleonora, baje. Two Steps Back! - Say. - I don't want to insist, but ... What is that woman to you? - Jealous? - It doesn't seem like the case, I just wanted to know. Do you want to make a scene? She is my secretary. And why are you taking it with you? - It can be useful. - Also when do you go dancing? But I'm not going to dance, and less in these places. - And what do we do? - Is the cinema going well? - Is she coming too? - Again? We left her in the car. Eleonora, come up, let's go to the movies. - Is L'Astor worth it? - What's going on? - "Come te movi, te furmino". Excuse me. Excuse me... Excuse me. Look what things these Japanese bring to the market . A naked Japanese girl! Imports of these corruption vehicles should be banned . - They could fall into the hands of youth. - Let me see. If these images disturb me, imagine teenagers. Let me see. - You needed me? - I wanted to tell you about your daughter. Do you know what made him lose his mind? - I'd rather never see her again. - Why? Forgive my frankness, but I'm the one who is getting a lot of affection for her. And what do you worry about? What's more, you should cultivate this feeling. No, I have never loved in my life, and I feel that I took a lot of affection, The day Virginia rejects me, it could be fatal. - Reject you? Why? - Because I'm not worthy. I am not worthy of her, I am not up to par, I come from a modest family. My father played the double bass. I know that I will end my days between these four walls, forgotten for life. You are right, your words make me reflect. You deserve much more, and I must help you to get out of anonymity. No, Mr. President. I want to continue being the dark executor of your orders. - Do you love Virginia? - I feel like I can't give it up. Then you have a duty to make your way and I must help you to get on the back of success. If it were up to me, I wouldn't ask for anything in life but if it's for Virginia, I gladly accept. You push me, and I will try by all means to make my way. - Will you take me with you to the Monaco congress? - No, I'm not taking you. - You will go alone! - To represent our country? -Yes. - You will make the speech I was going to make. - Will the TV be there? - Clear. - This is how you begin to make yourself known. - What will you do? I will go to Montecatini to get the cure and I leave the way to you, young people. A ti, a mi Virginia. Everything I do, I do for you, Mr. President. Can I call you dad? Quiet. - I am worried about him. - Why? - It is normal to travel by plane. - In two hours he is in Monaco. I am concerned about your overwork . The Secretary General works for four. Tonight he didn't quit his job. - He's a very scrupulous man. - The Secretary knows what his duty is. True, and a collaborator like you is very precious to him. I just do my duty. It's late. I have to go back to the office. I do not want to waste time. - Good morning, I am waiting for the actress Vera Serni. - Come in. That honor! I am confused and moved, Your Excellency. - No, I'm not excellence. - How, isn't it excellence? - It is wonderful! - I'm just the president of a private entity. Private but very important. Our organization enjoys great moral authority. - Therefore it can impose. - Unfortunately I know it well. But he has been so kind. - I have no words to thank you. - But what about? You wanted to bother yourself. Please sit down. - I could have gone to his house. - I would never have allowed a lady ... That good is. - Why didn't you want to receive me in your office? - Was not. These days my secretary general is in Monaco ... and I have allowed myself a little vacation. - But I'm talking about before. - If you only knew how many times I went to see you. - Thank you. In the office it is very different. My secretary general ... - What a terrible man! - Yes, terrible ... Sorry, I meant "severe." And bad if it weren't! Agostino has created a barrier between the audience and me, if not, there would be no peace. But in severe cases ... They are almost all serious. So for my case there is no hope? Do you know that your general secretary is going to ruin my career? And you let that madman free hand ? Don't say that, Agostino is an uncompromising, a cigar. That cigar looks at me with eyes ! Yes, it is true, Agostino's eyes pierce. His eyes do not pierce, they undress! And to make fun of me, you know what he said to me? "Go to the Academy of Dramatic Art ." - As if I ... - You're right, there's no need. You act spontaneously with all of yourself. And also the cinema is a visual, plastic art . So ... it can't be helped? - Everything has a remedy, dear. - You are a treasure! I simply try to understand myself , to help, resolving. So is it resolved? Yes? Your movie is a really serious case . I haven't seen her, but Agostino told me that her legs ... These legs are always in the air! Scene requirements. Now I stage it for you so you will be convinced Look, the scene is like this. My lover is sitting, just as you are. I go in and run to sit on his knees. The robe moves and the legs are uncovered. Is there malice? Tell me if there is malice. - And he kisses you? - No, he rejects me. And then her lover ... what does she do? - I'm here! - Dear mom! It allows? My mother. The president of the OIMP. - Are you ... - Yes. - What are yours! - Mom, please. They won't ruin my Vera, will they? It will make your career anyway. Look what flower ... The public eats it with their eyes. And all authentic, not foam like others. Touch if you don't believe it. - If I do not doubt it. - So why does the OIMP want to ruin my daughter? - It is not the OIMP, it is the mothers of the family. - What are these mothers looking for? May they have beautiful daughters like I did. - Mom, stop, the man has already found out. - Bravo. You reason like a man and you know how to look at a pretty girl. Has quickly understood that art is art and now explain it to the mothers of families. Sir, I must test my new car, will you join me? - Wow, my Vera drives the best car in Farina. - So he's coming? - Yes, with pleasure. - Well, let me, I'll be right back. - Mom, come. - Yes, dear, I'm coming. How sweet! What perfect curves! - Have you already seen it on screen? - Not yet. - Ah, not yet. Go see her in the movie "Your Body Will Kill Me." It is a dramatic song. You will see the feeling, the dramatic strength of my girl. How he knows how to cry ... and how he sings! - Mom! - I go! It allows? Excuse me. Hi. Ah, it's you, Virginia. I am in the office with the National Commission of family mothers. Cinematographic issues. - I'll be busy all afternoon, don't wait for me to have dinner. - It's okay. What am I going to do? I will call a friend Or I'll go to the movies alone I know we are not in England, but I am not going to meet any brutes. All right, stay calm. Hi Daddy. "Bye" Ladies and gentlemen, I conclude. Corruption increases in the world, the more dangerous corruption the more underhanded, insinuating, disorganized. Look at the movies ... What could I add now to the words so clear, specific from my dear Chinese colleague? Thank you. The actresses dispute the record, not from interpretation, but from thoracic circumference. Look at the magazines, the "réclame", the fashion, the beaches ... "Battle!" It is the cry of my Arab colleague. And battle be! Whenever and wherever, the same induces temptation made with the most diabolical means . And the striptease? Censors around the world tolerate it. They pass it off as an artistic spectacle , but what art is it? I... Take it easy, you said it before. What does? You too? Calm down, china. Calm, Japanese. Calm! Miss, there is a person who wishes to speak to the president. Dad is not there. He's out all day. But this young man has begged me to ask you when you can return. - A young man? - Yes, Miss. What happens. - Good Morning. - Did you want to talk to my father? I've been trying for many days that is why I have allowed myself ... He has done very well, my father called and said he will be back shortly. - Sit down. - Thank you. - A glass? - No, thanks, I don't want to bother. I am so alone. It keeps me a little company. - Do you mind if I put on a record? - I love music. - It's a blues. - We have the same tastes. I suspected it. - I can't be still. - Ahead. Nervous? Well, I have reasons, but it's better not to talk about it. - Can my father do something? - I could do a lot. Then rest easy because it blindly does what I say. Oh yeah? - You have a rhythm. - Do you think? Yes, because it has musical metrics. It allows? - What are you thinking about? - Miss, not to say. Don't make me suffer. Any bold thoughts? When one has 220 thousand lire in tributes every quarter, creditors, staff who are unemployed and still have to be paid, IGE and winter aid ... Speaking of winter assistance, where are you going to ski? I do not know. Let's not fight between brothers. Let's be compact and united. And I would like to call your attention about this statue. Oh God, what is it? Sorry. This statue, gentlemen, is naked. The artist has almost completely stripped her of her clothes. But neither in me nor in you does it provoke profane feelings. But the striptease? That striptease that is presented to the public today as an artistic spectacle, What is it? What is it, gentlemen in Congress? A fully clothed young woman goes on stage accompanied by exciting music. Slowly begins to undress and undressing, she shakes her hips. He waddles in provocative movements . And he takes off his clothes and walks around staying alone in combination. Then she also takes it off, staying in a bra, and in the end ... also the last bulwark of his puddiness, falls off. But it is not enough, the woman, remaining completely naked, keep pacing and wiggling. We must enter as doctors enter where lepers. and you two come with me. I'm going, and whoever wants to come, come. Am I doing well? - God, what's up? - Have you seen what brakes? - Yes, but let's go slowly. Don't you like to try the thrill of speed? I'd rather try other chills. Strange, I believed him to be far from certain impulses. When you have a beautiful woman like you around ... - Why don't we go to the pine forest? - Yes, I like nature so much. What a tonic, detoxifying air, exciting. - Do you do breathing exercises? - With my occupations ... - Try, develop the thorax. - Oh yeah? - Look. One two Three. Thanks, great, I feel like a lion. - Oh, poor me! Help! - No, don't yell! - Help! - Miss, don't yell, who knows what they will think! ¡No! ¡Socorro! Quiet! - Did it bother you? - No, we played. - Was he playing? - Yes, he played. - At his age ... This damn guard has screwed me up on this wonderful day. - Come on, I know a delicious place. - Where? - Come on. Giuseppe, am I wrong, or do you have to go to the station to get your sister? My sister? Oh yeah! - I can go? - Sure, go. - Thank you. I can't resist the temptation to untie men's shoes. - Sorry, but these are buckle. - Well, I'll take it off. Funny! Sit on the rug. I do n't understand this Italian mania ... of sitting in the chairs. - We are a very backward country. Giovanni, look me in the eye, tell me the truth. - What was happening at your place? - I assure you, nothing wrong. Orgies? At my premises, at most, they played pool. While in others things happen that cannot even be named. - And why hasn't my father closed them? - You don't know they exist. Well, tell me everything and I 'll tell you. They are not things that can be said like that to a young lady. I'm dying of curiosity. Escort girls? - In a sense ... - How do you do the meetings? It's very simple, usually the client is a wealthy old man. He calls a certain number and asks, for example, a French painting with a gold frame for the evening at 10. What does it mean? That the client wants a date with a French girl. - And the gold frame? - Blond hair. - Interesting. - And later? - The man goes to the appointment, in these famous places, dinner with the girl in a secluded living room where nothing is missing. The fireplace, the music ... A comfortable, discreet, very cozy atmosphere. Exactly like this one, there is also a fireplace, music ... A cozy place, and you are without a shoe. Excuse me miss, maybe you're right, you'd better stop bothering. I don't want your father to find us like this, alone at home. For charity, my father is a naive, if he found us, I do not know ... you in pajamas, and me in combination, I would think we are playing blind man. From how he discovers it, he would say that his father is naive. Rather, as the English would say, a "pure man". - What does it mean? - A pure. - We want a table. - All busy. That table is free. We want that table. - Sorry, it's reserved. - I reserved it, "Moralité Publique". - What "want"? - Syrup. The striptease begins. Easy, ssh! Gross. This, ladies, is an artistic spectacle, isn't it terrible? Now we can go, come on. Come on, you've seen enough, the striptease is over. They should be in bed by now, come on. Disgust! Scandal! Devils! - Would you like to come to my table? - I am coming right away. Come on, honey. - Thanks for the invitation. - But what do you do? - You invited me. - I haven't invited her. - It must have been an error on the line. - But you called me. Don't be delusional, I've called that lady. - Not wanting me? - No. Who are you? - You are rude. - You rude. - And ugly too. - Imagine, you are ugly. - Alo, fraulein. - Goodnight. - Speaks Italian? Little bit. - We drink something? - Charmed. Well. Monica. Monique. - Did you like my number? - Geez, it's good. I have rarely seen such a fast typist . - It was my trade. - Why did you quit? Better to undress in public than in private. That's good! No thanks, the champagne makes me puff up. ¿"Hincha"? I know these crap well, I don't trust them, they swell me, you tell them. But you have to ask for something. Well, two whiskey. - Do you dance? -Yes. - He's older? - Yes, I'm 22 years old. - How long have you been working in this place? - Two years. What do your parents say? Mom Dad... They live in the countryside. - You live alone? - Yes, in a furnished room. Free admission? Not for everyone. - Do you dance like that with everyone? - It depends on the man. Am I your type? - Ah! You Italians! - You'd like to go to Italy, huh? It has always been my dream. The sea, the sun, the blue sky ... - Are you going to "plug"? - Plug? - How much commission do you get per bottle? - 5%. In Italy you could keep 10%. - They exploit you here. - How do you know these things? My father played the double bass. What do you do next? Are you coming to my house for tea? - At 4 in the morning? - You are not required to drink. How much does a tea cost at home? - 100 marcos. That would be 14,800 lire at the exchange , right? - It's too much? - No, you could earn more. - What does it matter to you? - Let me do this account. Let's do the calculation of five caps at 5%. 5 x 5 = 25 ... It would be 950 lire. Then let's say 10 whiskey ... 10 whiskey ... That would be 740 lire, right? How much do you get for the striptease? 30 marcos. 30 marks ... It would be a total of 5200 lire. - I offer you to earn more. - You, in Italy? - Yes, in Rome. A more honest and more profitable job, does it suit you? - Let me taste your whiskey. - Drink yours. Why do you let yourself explode? You knew it, red water, right? - Yes, but what does it matter? - I pay 1,500 lire for this whiskey that they go to your boss's slave driver instead of you, right, little girl? I pay 1,500 lire for this whiskey and you give me red water. I throw this garbage and I don't pay you. Here, for the trouble. Congratulations on the slap. - He fired you, huh? - Yes, because of you. You made a post, I understood, what do you think? Me stupid? Now let's see if this job you said exists in Italy. You can find it for me. - Stay calm. - I hope I don't regret it. - It's cute, right? - Yes, a very cozy look. - It is a discreet place where you can dine in privacy. - Nice! - Discretion is one of the greatest virtues, don't you think? -Yes. - Good afternoon. How nice to see you again, how are you? - Well thanks. - I'm glad. - Mr. ... A good friend. - It is an honor. - Have you never come before? - Never. - Now you know the way. Sit down. - Do you want to stay for dinner? - Clear. - ¿Cenan afuera o in separate? - Separated. - Well. - Would you like a snack? - Yes. - For me a Martini. - Idem. - And olives and canapes with caviar. -We have the same tastes. Excuse me. ¡Barman! What peace! It seems to me to be an amnesiac who is recovering his memory. - Want to take a look inside? - Later. How sweet is your "later". A young man would have insisted, I would not. I know how to wait. - Bravo. You know how to do. - Yes, dear, I can do it. I know how to wait, I know how to taste. In this moment I savor, I look at her, admire her, desire her and savor her. And you dear, don't you relish? I'm going to phone my mother. I'll tell you we have a fault. - All good sir? - Perfectly, thank you. This is my phone number. - It is reserved for friends and personalities. - Thank you. If you don't want to say your name, just tell me: "Vera's friend." - Vera's friend. - If you want a reserved, you must say: "Marga, I would like a nice frame for the painting." A nice frame! Great cunning, delicate caution. - So I could also order a good painting. - Naturally. If you order a Flemish author painting, you mean you want a blonde girl. - And by Neapolitan author if I want her brunette. - Exactly. If you want it with vigor and claw, you should say - "French Impressionism". - Great! But no abstractism. If you get a good used painting , call me at this number. But please, no friend of Vera. When I call you, I'll say I'm from the Gallery of Figurative Arts. Magnificent! Good luck. - Oh God! - Who? What is it, are you afraid of that little woman? Speak lower, that spy on me. How did he know I'm here? - He must have followed me all day! - Who? - A devilish woman. He should have also sent her to Germany with Agostino, but you can never be cautious enough. Forgive me dear, but we have to go. - Let's go. - Okay, let's go. Rather, go ahead, I'll catch up with you at the crossroads. However you want. Gentlemen, my father played the double bass. I have known the lower side of society. And no one but me can affirm That these girls can be pulled out of the mud and saved. I have gotten one of them fired while others like her will see the beginning of a new job. I leave the word to the Chinese Ci Tao Co, while I go back to my work. Goodbye, gentlemen. ¡Ay, ay! Move! ¡Alt! That's enough! Kruger, what do they do? This is an artistic number, that one also imitates Greco. I do not care. Kruger, I need understanding girls that after the show they make me some "plug". The gentleman in Italy is becoming very demanding. When from Milan he comes to Rome on business, he has money, and what does he do at night ? You want to have fun, right? Dear Agostino, I think I have always pleased these gentlemen of yours. That they are not very different from ours. And are these ready after the show? - They go? - They don't like entertaining gentlemen. You laugh? You didn't have to ask. You must first hire them, so you tie them. These attractions, where are they worth to you? Monique is at the White Kat who makes you a full house every night. It's striptease is going well, it 's the Banana Boat that doesn't suit me, Eleonora writes to me. What can you give me for the Banana Boat? A Swede? I know what you need. Forward the following. Very good! But what Swedish? The black girl likes the Lord. - Watch out for these. - Why? That is a man. - No! -Yes. - You are a man? -Yes. - Why are you posing as a woman? - He didn't want to be a soldier. - Like me. And where do they come from? - It's a little bit complicated. - Are they clandestine? - It is not that they are clandestine, but it has many complications. It is understood. It's better this way, so they don't protest. - Do you like Italy? -Yes. You also like me. You also like me. - Thank you. - Shut up, you're a man! Let them move. - Let them move. - Move, girls. Id in Italy. Goodnight. Please come in. - Cigarettes? - No thanks. - You are new? - Yes, I came from Monaco with the girl who does the striptease. But she does the striptease before, huh. No, I'm allergic to gardenias, calceolarias. - And to the? - Calceolarias. What funny legs that girl has. They would be beautiful in the sun but with that bust, I don't know ... they do n't add up. Yes, but they balance the boss's accounts. And this is nothing, you will see later: navels! And the place is closed to me. Is that fair to you? - I would like to bring your father here. - Father! - Yes Dad! So you don't want anything? - Yes, your phone number. - 879560 ... - How? 879... Get started, stay tuned. This girl undresses badly. It has no method. How would you undress? With maddening slowness. Have you seen what premises? - ¡Virginia! - ¡Papá! - How are you here? - And you? I'm here because I have my good reasons ... as president of the OIMP. - Well, that's how he'll take note. - Who are you? - It's the billiard boy. How is Virginia allowed to be brought to these locations? - He wanted his daughter to see. - One in the family is enough. Just for rendering justice and for pleasing Virginia I made the effort and tonight for the first time in my life I have entered this sewer. - It's our turn. - What? You do not remember? Cha Cha Cha! Miss, you are wrong. He's crazy ...! Virginia, dear, come home. Be nice, go with her. I have to get to the bottom for your interest. - Waitress! - Do not worry. Go away, children. Please go home. - Speaks Italian? - Little bit. Miss, I apologize if I disturb you, but you don't know why I'm here. - It's easy to imagine. - I only want his own good. - My mission was one of morality. - Yes, yes, and then I end up in Baghdad. - Baghdad? - It's white! - I don't understand what you mean. No? Now I will explain. In Monaco I met another who was exactly like you. He told me that they exploited me, and that in Italy I could find an honest job, and it turned out that I do the same as in Monaco, but earning much less. Because there they gave me my 5%, here 3%. Also every night I have to dine with gentlemen. Poor dear. I don't know who this vulgar individual she met could be. For the poor defenseless girls the world is full of traps. But you can trust me. I am the president of the "International Organization of Public Morality". And if I am in these places, it is to learn about problems like yours. - Are you willing to help me? - Sure, daughter. As soon as the general secretary returns , a pure man, ... I'll tell you to take care of your case. - Thank you. I wish I could change life so much. It will change her, I promise you. - Good night dear. - Goodnight. Sorry if I believed ... Happens. He did not imagine that the problem of escort girls was so serious. - A veritable plague, Mr. President. - We will remedy it. As soon as our secretary general returns , we will begin the crusade. It will be hard work. These girls are uncontrollable. For these purposes they use technological advances. - Allow? - Please. Say it. Figurative Arts Gallery? Say. I have a wonderful occasion for you. If I understand. I take care of everything. Flemish school. Would you advise me this table? Is it a safe investment? I will not regret? Golden frame! Very well. - Bye. - Are you interested in paintings? Ancient. Art is a great comforter. - Then I'll invite you to my sister's house . - His sister? - Yes, he has an antique gallery. - I will be very interested. - Please. - Don't forget the girls. - Leave it to me, Baroness. - Thank you. Eleonora, are you here? Again, ladies. - Again, Mr. President. - Come in. It always comes at the right time. - I have the mail to sign. - Leave it there. These articles deal with our activity. You should make four copies of each. I need them for tomorrow morning. I can deliver them to you at midnight. - Copy these too. - What should I copy? - All background articles. - It will take me all night. - You will receive an extra pay. - Thank you. Goodnight. Eleonora, don't give up work. - It is urgent. - Stay calm. - Please. - Thank you. - Do you like the atmosphere? - Very nice. - And the painting? - It will come in a moment. - How is it? Lord, don't be so impatient! - Is she a class girl? - Sure, excellent education. And do you know that I am a certain age? What does it say? Age doesn't matter for a handsome man like you. Now I bring you the flamenco painting. Goodnight. You? - Miss, this is a mistake. - No, it's all very clear. - Let me explain. - I have understood everything. - Maybe appearances are against me, but ... But who does he want to kid? To nobody. I just want to know how certain things are done. Wasn't the show enough for you? - Do you want me to undress just for you? - Miss, what do you say? Oh God! Police. - That's the man who brought me to Italy! - Agostino? Come on, Snow White. Let's go! And I who have always considered him as my conscience. - Marga. - Welcome back, love. - All good? -Yes. - We're doing the math. - Eleonora. - Agostino! I was about to go. - How is the office going? - When you miss, everything goes wrong. - Tomorrow make no mistake, you have n't seen me . - I am not stupid. - The collection? - 450 mil. - 450,800. - El White Kat? - There is. - You go. White Kat? How much? While. Goodnight. How much? - 900 thousand. - Good, Friday. - It's the German striptease, which she likes very much. - We will renew it. A claim number is required for the Banana Boat as well. - I've brought black ones. - Let's see. - Are here. You like them? - Where they are? - Nepal, Kenya and Jamaica. - Where they make the rum. - What do you say? Do they have the papers in order? - Like yours. - What can they do? - I like this one a lot. - You like? - Is a man. - A man? - You are a man? Yes iam a man. Nice body, huh? Take them to sleep. - All together? - Not the man! - We have all the rooms occupied. - We put them in the canteen. - You are crazy? They pluck our bottles. - We close them inside. - Yes? - With the man? Okay, it's up to you, take them. Let's go. Are you going to sleep at home or are you keeping me company? I stay with you. You ask me? - Agostino! - Yes. - Aren't you coming to sleep? I say hi to dad and go. Father. Good night father. - Welcome back, Mr. Secretary. - Crosswords? - We expected him for Thursday. - A little surprise. I wanted to see if everything worked in my absence . - Is the President working? - No. - What time is it? - 11.30. - In his absence, he comes at noon. - When is he leaving? - At 1. Continuous time, huh. - Would you let me? - Yes. - As you can see, we have covered the navel. - Good. - Already. - From bad to worse. Now it is more exciting. Outside the veil. - But... Have you heard the news? Have you been accepted into the Academy of Dramatic Art? With my physique I have no need. - I inform you that my film opens today. - Hadn't it been withdrawn? - The mothers of families have withdrawn the complaint. - Who convinced them? - They have spoken with the President. - What do you do outside of your post? - I have allowed myself to accompany the lady. - It is not necessary! There was nothing pornographic in my film . You lady. Its presence is enough to create a turban atmosphere. Thank you. How nice. It was not a compliment. - Have you ever performed a striptease in public? - How is it allowed? Why? I would not do it? Mr. Secretary General! ¡Eleonora! Welcome back, Mr. Agostino. - It's a German candy, from Monaco. - Thank you. - Chew slowly. To work! - Eleonora, did you shorthand the tape? - All filed. - Good. Machine. Detailed relation to the OIMP congress in Germany. The problem of young women in the northern country it is more dramatic day by day. Has happened to myself to notice young women on the street that turned to look at me. As if the roles had been changed. Mr. Secretary General, go to the president. - In advance? - In advance. Good morning, Mr. President. Good morning to all. Could you know the reason for this assembly? Dear Agostino, you should imagine the reason for this assembly. Have I been appointed vice president? Do you know what a man like you is called in England? - I don't know English. - They call him "slave trader". - Would you like to translate, please? - One who does white trade. - What does it mean? - You should understand. - You are a monster. It entered our organization like a snake after getting rid of Mr. Menegotti, that poor old man. It has taken advantage of the good faith of thousands of mothers of families. What do we do, Mr. President? Do we continue to listen to it? My dear son, you have to go. Do I have to go after everything I 've done for our organization? If you don't go, we go. You go away, I'm not holding you back. Gentlemen, an alternative has been proposed . What should we do? Mr. President, don't you think we should go? Dear sir, do you want to leave without creating problems ... or do you prefer to face scandal? - I prefer scandal. Dear Agostino, think about it ... you will be crushed by the weight of your guilt. Well, "Samson die with all the Philistines." We have nothing to reproach ourselves for, our conscience is immaculate. Mr. President, decently speaking, the cleanest here has scab. Will you, Mr. President? You too, Mr. Menegotti. - Where has it gone? - He must have gone to wash his hands. Put, plug. No, that's industrial, the other one. - What is this artifact? - Eleonora, press the button. - What is it? - What is this clown? Eleonora, let Mr. Menegotti listen to you . Insert # 1. All right, you keep it. Menegotti got 300 thousand , 300 thousand you, so the poster passes and everything is fixed. Mr. Menegotti! Menegotti, I refuse to believe that it has been corrupted. Let's not be too hasty, Mr. Conde, there is also for you. Eleonora, go ahead. Insert number 2. - Hi. This is Count Vasaldi Vertinacci. - Say, Count. - Dear Menegotti, do you have 300? - Yes, recently. So okay uh, "fifty-fifty" 150 for me and 150 for you. I am stunned! I understand, we are all men, I understand human weakness, But this exceeds the limits! Mr. President, don't get excited, it can make you feel bad. Sit down. Is not over. Eleonora, give Mr. President insert 3. - Is she a class girl? - Sure, excellent education. And do you know that I am a certain age? What does it say? - But who is this libertine? One of you? - Are you. Faced with this scandal, we have no choice but to resume our activity in the humane society . Creatures more worthy than you men. - Between us, is there an agreement? - It's okay. - Let's listen. What do you propose? - It's very simple. This wonderful 17th century style atmosphere I will be relieved, paying in cash. And it will be transformed into a modern nightspot, where many women and a good orchestra will abound . I give each of you the possibility to associate with my company. I admit that as secretary of the OIMP I may have deserved some criticism but in nightclubs, I assure you gentlemen, that I am an expert. - Don't be crazy. - I'm smart! Everything has a limit! Here you do not even bite to enter. The commissioner ... Are you Sergio Sciscia? - Do you have two names? - At least 5. But arrest warrants and convictions even more so. Let's not talk about scams and abusive practice of profession. In fact, he has been an abusive doctor for three years. - But no fatal cases. - It is also known abroad. - In Lugano you have been convicted of fraud. - He was in Lugano! - And he knew Wanda the Captain. - Why? And also a certain Pippo. So you were the one running around the rooftops in your pajamas with 30,000 Swiss francs. Those 30 thousand francs were mine. - That's a matter for the Ticino canton police . - But what canton? - Take it away. - Wait a minute, Commissioner. One last hug. - Eleonora ... - Agostino, where are they taking you? - They take me, dear. We have had so many good times together, don't forget. Hide the package, when it comes out you give it back to me. - Are they arresting me for the black thing? - Exactly. I would like to discuss an objection with you . Don't worry, we'll discuss it later. And my 30 thousand francs? Interpreting the feelings of thousands of mothers I beg you to close the incriminated premises. Don't worry, Mr. President, We will start with this office. Commissioner, I would like to ask you one last favor. Reopen Caracas, the pool hall. Yes, it is a personal favor that I ask of you before I resign. The pool hall? Oh, no difficulty. - Thank you. - Thank you, Commissioner. Say it. Here is the Gallery of Figurative Arts. Yes. Don't you remember? I have a Greek painting, black frame, made of ebony. Yes mom. Okay, Mom. Yes mom. Yes. Hello, mom. - My mother. - How lucky you still have a mother. - I'm glad I was able to do something for you. - Thank you. - Where are we going to celebrate the event? - Wherever you want. Giovanni, I already thought you weren't going out. Did you forget that I was waiting for you? I was talking to the lady. Do you know that I might get them to reopen us? - Then you are the president's daughter. - And you the little sister. - Yes. - No, I'm the woman. What a good surprise. So can we stay calm, that the place will be reopened? It depends on dad! - As? - Bye. - Where is he going? Isn't he coming, miss? - I'm going with my father. I told you to wait in the car! I shit on ...! Let's start by saying that the tallest is a man who dresses as a woman not to be a soldier. The other two are voluntary, therefore it is not my fault. Allow me a small objection. What are they? Wives? - Are they regulatory? -Yes. Commissioner, this is a mistake. Allow me a small objection. As long as it goes up, we'll talk later. What does the code say: "is white"? They are black! If you have made this mistake, ... apologize or modify the code. - Let's go! What do they do? Do they modify it? Translation: Vozidar
