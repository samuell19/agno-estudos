See? I knew they'd be here to see us. Anyway, the weather is nice, isn't it? Want to go swimming later? - Aren't they awesome? - Yeah. Hey, hold still, little buddy. Let's get you on camera. Come here. Come here. That's your favorite one, right there. There you are. I missed you so much. You're such a cutie. Let's go! Holly, you're not even gonna get your paddle? Come on. Race you. Be careful. Dad said. All right. Time to switch cameras. That footage, though, was amazing. Are you gonna be famous, Kev? Nah. I just wanna make real movies, you know? Need a new camera, full editing suite, sound equipment. Don't give up, okay? Christmas is only 158 days away. Yeah, only you would know that. You gotta keep up with the important stuff. You're such a nerd. And you are just jealous. Yeah, sure. Not. Look. Seasalt's back. Oh, hey, big guy. How's the fishing today? Not good, I guess. He's got that "I'm hungry" look. And I'm starving, too. Ditto. I'll get the fishing poles. I'll get the stove ready. You fish, and I'll cook. Kevin! Yeah? Yeah, yeah. Look. Probably a loggerhead. Mm-hmm. I just hope they hatch while we're here. I wanna film 'em. Well, it takes them about 60 days to hatch. You read way too much. Just depends on the temperature, rain, "humididee." It's "humidity." That's what I said, "humimidee." Hey, be careful. You can't touch 'em. Duh. I know that. Loads of creatures around like the taste of turtle eggs. We forgot to call Mom. Phone's in the kayak. This is the perfect spot. Am I right, Charlie? Yes, sir. Grade A, prime real estate. Yeah, working on it. He's old friends with the owner. We are gonna be in business. So break it to me. Where do we stand? The last 10 acres. How many acres you say? Mom called. We gotta go. Get down. Look. It's 100, I believe. - 102. - Ah. I like exact. You stay here. Sure thing. Okay, are you 100 percent sure this thing's covered? This thing goes south... I'm finished. You have my word on it. Election's coming up. I can't afford any screw-ups. Get us that zoning permit, and I'll take care of the rest. This deal just might help you win reelection. You just remember this, Mills. I go down, you go down, too. Gotta run. Swanky lunch fund-raiser for my campaign. Never keep hungry money waiting. Don't laugh. You have two weeks to close the deal with those investors, or they walk. It's done. Don't worry about it. Get, um... Get those blueprints that fit all that EPA crap on my desk ASAP. Sure thing. I'll have 'em drawn up, by, say, Monday morning? Excellent, and, um... Let's keep this quiet, okay? As a church mouse. What do you think they're doing here? This is our cove. Don't know, but the man in the suit sure looked familiar. Mr. Mills. Hmm? Uh, we got trouble. Hey, uh, you kids, you want to come over here and take a look through the telescope? I don't trust these guys. Let's book it. Come on. Come on. Come on! Hey, Jimmy. Yeah, it's me. We might have a little problem. Go, go, go. That was a close one. Yeah. Wish I could have filmed those guys. Something wasn't right. Over here, guys! I don't see the dolphins. Must not like it either. Yeah, let's just head back home. Hey! Hey, man! Hey, no-wake zone! What're you doing? Hey! Watch where you're going! Make him stop, Kevin! Make him stop! Holly, it's gonna be okay. Just relax. Hey! Holly. Holly? Holly! Holly. Holly, you okay? You okay? Come on. Come on. On the shore. Go ahead. Come on. Right here. Just breathe, okay? Keep breathing. What a loser. I'm gonna call the Beach Harbor Patrol! You're toast, bro! Thanks, Kev. I knew you'd save me. It's wasn't me. It was them. They saved us. I'm gonna grab the kayak. Wait here. Please tell me at least that you were wearing your life jacket. No, sir. Kev, what if you two had drowned? All right, we trust you to be responsible and look after your sister. But... But the dolphins saved us. Exactly, and it was all that crazy guy in the speedboat's fault. Uh-uh. That's not gonna cut it. I told you a thousand times, you go on that water, you assume that everyone's a nut-job. Could have lost my camera, too. You could have lost your life, and your sister's. Now, you know the rules. Safety first. Two weeks, no kayak. It wasn't our fault! You want to make it three? Sorry, kiddos. That's life. There are consequences for breaking rules. Speaking of rules, sweetie, what did we say about the hat at the kitchen table? Mm, you sure? Oh, yeah, I'm sure. Come on. All right, that's it. All right, frogs outside. Kids to bed. - We're gonna take this up in the morning. - Sorry, Dad. Love you. Love you. - Love you. - Good night. I mean, what are we gonna do with these two? I never acted like that. Look, they're growing up. It's just part of it. No, back in... back in my day and age, we respected the rules. I mean, we knew the rules. We practiced them, because practice makes... Don't flinch! Ow! That's my bum shoulder. Obviously your genes are dominant. What? Which is why they're so good-looking. What's wrong? I've got a really bad feeling. Yeah. It's probably Dad's breakfast burritos, huh? No. It's not a stomach-ache bad feeling. They're in trouble. I just know it. There's my queen. How's it going? I was just thinking that maybe I should skip summer semester. Um, I was talking about the Ryan Express. Oh, yeah. Um... Just the water pump. Oh, just the water pump. No big... Anything else on your mind? Well, I don't know. I mean, maybe I should spend summer with the kids, you know, keep an eye on them. Honey, what happened yesterday is not your fault. Okay? And you spent so much time. We gotta get this master's degree done. What would Coach Dunn say, huh? You march all the way down the field, if you don't score... I know. You'll never finish. I know. That's right. And if you wanna compete, you gotta complete. Look, well, one semester won't hurt. All right, I can be with the kids, maybe get a part-time job. Look, money's been tight lately, and we got a lot of stuff to take care of around here. Come here. I got this. Everything is gonna be fine. In fact, I have a meeting this morning with the boss, and I happen to know that he wants to talk to me about the VP slot. Ooh. And you have a smudge on your forehead. Perfect. The Captain would be so proud of you. You think so? Oh, I know so. I'll see you tonight. Right. - Bye, kids! - Bye. Listen to your mother. Looks like we're stuck, Kev. I have an idea. You see what I mean, Mom? Mom... Aw, come on. Look, Kev, your dad said no ocean for two weeks. I know, but we'll just go check things out. No harm in that. Look, I'm sure the dolphins are just fine. Mom, you know how sometimes you get that feeling down in your belly? A really sad, bad feeling? Sweetheart, what's the matter? I've got that feeling. She's pretty good about these things, Mom, I mean, in a strange and weird way, but... Well... I guess she could use a test run. Yes. Yeah. That sure is a beauty, sir. This is it. Wow. Tell you what. You, uh... You take your family out anytime you want. Really? Sure. Oh, they would love that. Have a seat. Thank you, sir. Just look at it... the mystery, the power. Feel it? Oh. Yeah. The ocean's a, uh... it's a mirror of life, Ryan. It's always moving and flowing. It's making its own path, just like we make our own path. Mm, yes, sir. My wife's a bit more astute about the water than I am. I married the daughter of a fishing boat captain. It's... It's Abby, right? You say she's finishing up her master's? Yeah, mechanical engineering. That's what I like about you, Bob. I mean, you're a family man. You're a hard worker, a competitor. Football man, right? Yeah. All Gulf Conference, receiver at North Central State. Oh, well... Well, yeah. I, uh... I was a baseball rat myself, played a year of semi-pro until I blew out my left knee sliding to third. It's funny. You know, it still aches sometimes. Oh, I feel you. I mean, both my knees are squinky. You know the greatest thing about sports? Teaches you not only how to win, but that the team comes first. That's so funny that you say that. My old coach, Dunn, that was his motto. - "Team first, men, always." - That is a smart man. Why don't we take her out? I wanna... I wanna show you something. This is where we hang out. Pretty sweet, huh? Yeah. Hasn't changed since I was a kid. Your granddad used to bring me here. - I caught my first yellowtail right over there. - Cool. Yeah, I'm cooler than you thought, huh? Look! There they are! See? That's them. Yeah, you're right. Really beautiful. There's only four. Where is he, Kevin? Who? Holly's favorite. He's not here. Come here, little buddy. Where are you? Come here. Where are you? I knew he was lost. Uh, I'm sure he's fine. He'll be back soon. What are we gonna do? Just let us come back tomorrow, Mom, okay? We'll wear our life jackets. We'll sign in. I promise. We'll do anything. We'll talk to your dad about that, okay? We'll head home down the coast, and see if we spot him. Where are you, little buddy? Come on. Where are ya? I brought you out here for a reason, Ryan. You know, Mr. Mills, I just, uh... I got a couple of questions about this project. Could you, um, just cut the formalities, Bob, and call me Winston? Uh, yes, sir. Winston. So, uh, I've been waiting on the final paperwork from Legal, and the attorneys have been more tight-lipped about this than anything I've ever seen. Yeah, well, I kind of wanted it that way, 'cause I'm dealing with some heavy financial hitters, and they requested total confidentiality. That's why I brought you out here myself. See it? It's 102 acres of prime ocean-front real estate. This is our little secret. Deal is we're building an aquatic-themed ocean park. Oh, that's good. My kids are gonna love the idea. They're on the water out in these parts all the time. They're gonna be so excited. Oh. - When's the big announcement? - Well, that's the one hiccup. There's one piece of land right in the middle of the property that we haven't secured yet. The owner's been a stickler at selling, so, uh, clock's ticking. We got less than two weeks to lock up the deal, or my investors walk. Who's the holdout? It's, um, some ex-NFL player. He's... Grew up around here. His name's Luke Lawson. Luke Lawson? Yeah. That was my college quarterback. What? Yeah. We were roommates all of senior year. You gotta be kidding. What a small world. Yeah. Do you... Do you think... I don't know... maybe you could talk to him? Well, yeah. I tell you what. You take the lead on this. Make him an offer he can't refuse. Luke. I mean, we haven't been in touch in recent years, but I can... I can certainly try. Just at least think it over. I mean, it's, uh... You know, we lose this piece of land, the deal goes away. You know, and I promise you, you will be rewarded handsomely. Izzy speaking French again? Yep. He thinks he's European. Mom, Izzy wants a new aquarium. Oh, he does, does he? Well, I think Monsieur Izzy is being a little too greedy. Did you know that there are over 40 species of dolphins, and some stay with their mama until they're eight years old? No, I didn't know that, but it doesn't surprise me that you do. Maybe saying a prayer for your little friend might be a good idea, too. I already did. Said two, just in case. But what about tomorrow? Can we go look for him? I'll talk to your dad when he gets home. Okay? We'll figure something out. Okay. Right. Good night. Good night, Mommy. Come on. Come on. Where you at? Come on. Ah, bingo. Bingo. All right. Hang in there, little buddy. Whoo! I'm late. Morning, darling. Morning. So did you think about what we talked about last night? I mean, the kids, they're... they're really worried about that dolphin. Abby, I don't get it. It's a dolphin. What are you gonna do, put an APB out on it? No. I mean, it's just good that they care about the ocean, the animals, you know? Of course. The Captain taught you well. The most beautiful boat mechanic in all the world. And I still say no on the kayak, all right? Um, I'm gonna try and come home early tonight so maybe we could throw the football around. So? So? So? Are we out of jail? So that's why I haven't seen you two? - Mm-hmm. - Sneaky little boogers. So he still says no kayaks, and I can't take you out today. Promised Ms. Peters I'd look at her freezer. It's on the fritz again. Bummer. Sorry, kiddos. I mean, your dad says we can put out an APB. - What's an APB? - Just kidding, sweetheart. Bad joke. It's "all points bulletin." Police use it to find bad guys. Yeah, or missing persons. - Is this your dolphin? - Yeah. Can you make more of these? Sure. Why? Make 50 copies. Oh, and add the word "missing" at the top. Missing? And your phone number at the bottom. But why the pho... I get it. A real APB. Okay. Good job, Mom. I, um, need your signature on this. Okay. Thanks. Just initial at the bottom of page one, and then sign the second page for me. Great. Want to tell me what I'm signing? Oh, it's just a standard NDA. Sandy... Mm-hmm? I haven't signed a nondisclosure on any project since I've been here. Well, this deal's being structured a little bit differently, and there's several private parties involved, and it's just what Winston wants, so... Right. Uh, Winston was wondering if you reached out to Mr. Lawson about that land. No, but, um... but I'm gonna be right on that. Okay, good, 'cause, uh, Winston was asking. And just so you know, by the way, um, the word around the office is that you're up for Jack's old position, so... I'm just saying, VP would look nice on that trophy case back there. Yes. Yeah. Yes, it would. Done. This is the last one. All righty. It's been a long day. Uh-huh. Do you think we'll find him? I don't know. We will. Hey, Digger. Hey, Mikey. Oh, hey, Kevin. What are you two up to? APB on a missing dolphin. That's crazy. How could you just lose a dolphin? It's a big ocean. This is a good picture. Are you guys, uh, still doing that movie? Yeah. It's a documentary. Have you seen him? He's about this big. I've seen a lot of dolphins today. - Yeah, one almost jumped in our boat. - More than any fish did. That's for sure. You know, we saw the, uh, Marineland truck loading something up about a half-mile up the beach. I mean, what do you think? Yeah, it was a pretty good size. Could have been a dolphin. It's him! I just know it is! Okay. Thanks, Digger! Thanks, Mikey! Yeah, uh, good-bye. Good luck. No problem. Hello! Hello! Help! Please let us in! Sorry. We're closed for the day. Opens at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow. You gotta let us in! You've got our dolphin! And this is our entire facility. We have 16 dolphins. Oh, and be careful around the edge of the pool. The dolphin we rescued is over here. Oh, see? He's got a bad sunburn. Must have been beached for hours. I didn't know dolphins got sunburned. Well, look at that. I'm putting that on tape. The nerd doesn't know everything. Yeah, they're a lot like us in many ways. So what's gonna happen to him? Uh, we'll keep him here under quarantine and evaluate his progress. When can he go back home? I don't know. That's if we can even find his pod. We know where his family is. How do you know that? They're our friends. We swim with them. Oh, no, that's not good. Why not? Well, even though dolphins seem to love interacting with humans, they are wild animals. They're protected by laws. If we can release him, you can't swim with him again. Okay? They aren't pets. Promise? - Promise. - Promise. I just wish I knew how he got stranded. It was this crazy boat driver. He even flipped over our kayak. Hmm. That makes sense. Probably got disoriented and separated from his family. Boats, litter, pollution, many reasons we need to be more responsible for our oceans. It's Mom. We're late again. I knew it. He's glad we're here. See you tomorrow. Tomorrow? Uh... Okay, I guess. Looks like someone has a best friend. - They're on their way. - Oh, fantastic. You know, I left work early just to have a little Ryan fam bam time. I shouldn't have said anything about the football. Maybe. You think I was too tough on 'em? Perhaps. That's very nice. We're gonna get you a tryout with Miami. I just want what's best for us, you know? I'm gonna give them everything that I never had. Abby, I really think that Winston's gonna give me this VP slot. That'd be sweet. I mean, I knew you'd get it! - I said, "Might." What are you... - Whoo! I am so proud of you, Robert Ray Ryan. Nobody works harder than you. I said, "Might." He picked the right man. Boy, well, let's hope. Oh, brother. Really, guys? Out in the open? Guess what! We found him! Yeah. We found him. That's amazing. Yes! Come here. So what's gonna happen to him? Uh, we'll keep him here under quarantine and evaluate his progress. Isn't he the coolest dolphin ever, Mom? Pretty cool. Handsome fella, for sure. Yeah, I could edit this footage, post it on the Internet, and let everybody know we found him. So as I was saying, if your old man gets this promotion, it could be a really, really big deal for the whole family. That's awesome. That's awesome. Yeah, cool. Mom, he's got a spot on his back. Did you know dolphins got sunburnt? All right, I can shoot some more tomorrow. We can make a "save the dolphin" video. Yeah. Yeah. Ooh, ooh! What I have to tell you has to do with the dolphins, huh? Really? Oh, now you're interested. How would you kids feel about an ocean-themed marine park, huh? A marine park where your father can get as many family passes as he wants? A marine park? Mm-hmm. With sea animals? With sea animals and lots of rides, an ocean park, and it'd be really cool, because it'll educate people about the sea animals, and it will stimulate the local economy. What do you think about that, huh? Win-win for everyone. You done? Almost. I don't like that marine park idea. Yeah, I wish Dad wasn't so excited about it. All right. Exporting. I'm kind of nervous about this. I've never posted any of my stuff online before. It's gonna be great, Kev. Yeah. Yeah. So nothing out of the ordinary? No one snooping around the property? No, sir, not today. I found a few more nests, removed 'em. Good. Get 'em all. I do have something for you. Yeah, that looks like them. I found a campsite set up near the cove. And? I made it pretty clear the area can be very dangerous. You know, I, uh, can't have any kids getting hurt. Who said anything about them being hurt? What are you doing to him? Working on that sunburn. Good news is his blood work came back good, so we'll keep him here under quarantine to monitor his progress. What happens then? Well, we'd like to find his pod. This is a rare case for Marineland. We aren't a rescue and rehab facility. Our animals can't be released back into the wild. They couldn't survive without our care. We'll help you for free. We are definitely short-staffed with the new budget cuts, so I might just take you up on that offer. Oh. All our other dolphins have names. Does he have one? Well, hmm. Since he has a big sunburn, how about... Bernie? I love it. It's perfect. You know what? I have an idea. Interesting. This could help us. Uh, Kevin, can you record his responses? Think you guys could find his pod, play them Bernie's replies? Sure, and we could... We can't. We're grounded. We can't be in the water. Yeah, right. Oops. I'll call your mom, I'll see what I can do to help. Oh, but no swimming with them. Promise? Pinky swear. Oh, Bernie. I don't see the dolphins. Maybe they're not here. No, they'll be here. They won't leave Bernie. It's like you're part dolphin or something. What's wrong with that? Nothing. I'm just saying. - Look! There they are! - Oh, sweet. Play his video. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's working. Look. Look at 'em. Yes. Awesome. This was good. Cool. We got some awesome footage today. I'll edit it later. Let's call it, "Bernie's Journey." Cool. Let's go get some shots of the cove. There's always something going on there. All right. Let's do it. Yeah, I'll go ahead and edit that part out. Hey! What's all this? No trees passing? It's "trespassing." No bueno. I got all the city board members convinced. Our final zoning vote is this week. It will pass unanimously. You gonna stand there staring, or tell me where we stand? It's them again. It just needs a working... I'm gonna get 'em this time. Just need the last 10 acres. But Bob Ryan's working on it. He's old friends with the owner. But... Shh! Shh! - Well, it better work. - Quiet. We're in way too deep for this thing to be exposed. Don't worry, Mayor. Within 18 months, we are gonna be in business. If this thing all goes as planned, might just catapult you into a run for the governorship. Governor Brock Winters. That does have a nice ring to it. Got 'em, Mr. Mills. Look. That one. Shh. Shh. The speedboat guy. You sure that's all of it, Jimmy? Yes, sir. It's all I could find. What do I do with 'em? Just get it far away from here. Those crazy environmental nuts see those eggs, it'll cost us millions in fines. Hey, why don't you just take 'em home, Mills? Show 'em to your kids. They might hatch. Hey, what do you think about buying that fish hospital? Fish hospital? Yeah. What, are you talking about the marine habitat? Yeah, I guess they found some sunburned dolphin. With the right press coverage, we could turn it into a moneymaker, you know? Slimy fish gets new home, and then you and I look like heroes. Hey. Hey, hey. I like the sound of that. Bernie's not a fish! He's a mammal! And we're gonna put him back in the ocean when he feels better. - It's time to go. Come on. - And you guys are going to jail for taking those turtle eggs! Now you just hold on a second, okay? No one's going to jail. I'm the mayor. You've seen me on television. There's nothing to worry about. Listen, I don't need any problems, okay? Don't worry, Mr. Mayor. There are no problems here. Besides, these two are trespassing. - That's my camera! What are you doing? - Yeah, yeah. And this is my property, and you... Aren't you Bob Ryan's kids? Yeah, and we're gonna tell our dad everything! No, you're not gonna tell your dad anything, because if you do, I'll fire him. And, uh... Where's your proof now, right? Tell you what. Why don't you both get out of here before I have you both arrested! Come on! Go, go, go! Not good, Mills. Need to lock this up. I'll take care of it, okay? Get rid of that. I'll take care of it. How long has it been, 10 years? Longer. Since your wedding. No, has it been that long? Yeah. Oh, man. Time flies. I gotta admit I was a little jealous I wasn't the one catching all those touchdowns. Hey, I just got lucky. Besides, you made me look good, helped me get drafted. Oh. Yeah, right. Big Gun Law. You just had that touch, you know? Always hit us right in the numbers. Hey, sorry I lost touch, R.R. Bouncing around the league for 13 seasons, then wrecking my shoulder. One day, you're on the field playing. The next day, you realize, never play again. I wouldn't be complaining too much. It looks like you're doing all right. I mean, what would Coach say? "It's not how you start. It's how you finish, dang it, Lawson." Oh, you sound just like him now. Doosh. Enough about me. What's going on with you, Abby? I hear you got two kids now, right? I mean, Abby's great. She's getting her master's. Kevin's 11. Holly's 9. They're both geniuses like their mom, though, uh, Kevin's not so much into football. Can't even get him to play catch with me. Ah, give him time. Probably late bloomers, like you. So glad you found me, R.R. So you mentioned my property on the phone earlier. I had a real-estate firm try to buy it from me a couple months back, but don't much like the guy I talked to, though. Yeah, right. That's, uh, Winston Mills. That's my boss. Hmm. I don't know, R.R. He just seemed a little too slick for me. Look, I think the deal could be good for you. It's definitely a positive for the city, but the last thing I'm here to do is hard-sell you. I'm gonna show you the plans - after I... finish kicking your butt right now. - Tell you what. You sink that next bag, you got yourself a deal. Sure you wanna do that? Why not? Like old times, right? Wow. Fine. Ooh! Ooh! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Why didn't you tell them off? You could have helped me, you know? We just ran like little scaredy-cats. You're right. Giving all this stuff away. What? I'm not gonna do this anymore. I'm done. So what, are you just gonna give up? No camera, no more films. When did you become such a baby? We just need to get your camera back. That footage could save Bernie and put those bad guys in jail. The camera's gone, and they're not our pets. All right? We caused this. You're right. They're not our pets, but they are our friends. He's so fast. Go, Bernie! Go! Wow. He looks great. Yeah. We should be able to release him soon. Cool, huh? Hey, little buddy. Here. Yay! Wow, look at him go. He sure is happy. Bernie's video has over 10,000 views. Hey, what's the matter, kiddo? Your footage is a hit. You should be doing cartwheels. That's what I told him. Be happy, like Bernie. Hey, so what's the deal? Where's your camera? All right, somebody better start talking. Okay, I'll just call your mom. No, no, no. No, don't. No. Yeah, I can't help you if I don't know how. There's nothing anybody can do right now. Our dad's boss and the mayor, they're trying to... - Stop! Stop it! Stop it, Holly, right now. - We need help, Kevin. You pinky promise you won't tell? Well, yes, I'm very interested. So it is for sale, then? Then let's do it. All right, make... make the offer. Hey, look, I gotta go. You make sure you get that offer in before the end of the day, okay? Come in. Bob. Ah, successful meeting, I hope? Well... Got him to sign, and, uh, I had him initial every page. This is, um... This is well done. You are really something, Bob Ryan. Ah, I'm just trying to do my part, sir. Oh, please have a seat. Oh. Thank you. Ah. My kids have that same camera. Oh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I've... You know, I've had that thing forever. My kids love to... They love to fool around with it. You know, you! You scored a touchdown, Bob Ryan. Or should I say... Mr. Vice President of Commercial Acquisitions? Thank you, sir. It's a big job. I know you can handle it. I mean, you have no idea how much this means to me and to Abby and the kids. Um... You know, talking about your kids, I ran into them yesterday down at the cove, and it seems like we had a slight... ...misunderstanding. Maybe you just heard them wrong. No, they said they'd fire Dad, then buy Marineland. Buy Marineland? Yeah and they have the mayor on their side, too. They're really mean people, Sidney. I mean really, really bad people. But we have to tell your parents. We can't. They said they'd fire Dad. But listen. We got this. Mom and Dad always said we gotta be responsible for our own actions, all right? We got ourselves in this mess. We can get out. We'll do the best we can, Bernie. Just hang in there. - Hey. There you are. How's Bernie? - Better. He's eating a lot, and Sidney says we can release him soon. Well, that's good news, yeah? Hand me the pliers, please. So, uh, what's with the long faces? Mom... what if somebody was doing something really, really wrong? Would you tell? Even if they told you not to? That depends. What'd you guys do now? Um... Dad's boss, Mr. Mills, uh, he... Uh, he, um... He what? He's not gonna build an ocean theme park. Hey, kids. Kevin, what do you say we grab the old pigskin and I teach you the five-step drop? Because to succeed in this life, you must go deep. Seems that they got something to tell us, right? Dad... Mr. Mills is not gonna build an ocean park. Mr. Mills told me that, uh, you overheard him speaking with the mayor. Kids, he was talking about a completely different project. Dad, he's lying, okay? He said he'd fire you. - Oh, he's lying? Is that right? - Yeah. Well, that's... that's interesting, because I just kinda got promoted. You're looking at the new VP. - That's great, hon. I'm so proud of you! - Yes. Mmm! It is a big day for the Ryans. Uh, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna get changed. We're gonna take out the Ryan Express, and I'm gonna show you the spot. You see? Your dad knows what he's doing, okay? It'll all work out. Okay. There is it, kids. Right there. Right on that piece of land right there. That's where a massive ocean park is gonna go. It's gonna have rides, water slides. You're gonna love it. Uh, but, honey, this is the kids' hangout. You sure this is it? 'Course I am, honey. Winston brought me out here personally. Look. There they are. Tell them Bernie's okay. Guys, Bernie's fine. We found him, okay? He got beached, and he's just sunburned, but he's fine now. Kev, where's your camera? You can get some shots for Bernie. Um, I'm just gonna use my phone. You don't have your camera, Kev? - No. - That's funny, you know? Winston has a camera just like yours. All right. Let's go in. I'm excited to show you the lay of the land. Come on. We're almost there. Wait a minute, you guys. I'm the tour guide here. Right there, that's... that's our... What happened? It's gone! Someone took all our stuff. What? Oh, no! The eggs! Holly! Where is everybody going? That's it, bud. Oh, and by the way, Winston says no more coming down here, 'cause once we start construction, it could be dangerous. Um, Dad, uh... Isn't it something, huh? Yes, sir, it's something, all right. We found them. They're there. You found what? Am I missing something here? - Mr. Winston's gonna... - Gonna save the turtle eggs, Dad, right? Yes, of course, kids. We're gonna be ecologically conscious. Yeah. Yeah, we'll stay away from here from now on, Dad. That's good. So that's it. Over here is gonna be the entrance. And then, Holly, over here, that's gonna be a 50-foot water slide. Those kids of yours are quiet tonight. Too quiet. Ab, you know I only want what's best for you and the kids, right? Of course I do, honey. And the kids know that, too. Sometimes I think I just try too hard. Met with Luke Lawson today. Luke Lawson? Mm-hmm. I haven't heard you mention him in years. I didn't even know that he was back in town. He owned some land that we need for the park. I got him to sell. Well, that's good. You did your job. What's wrong? I know that look. Just brought back memories, you know? I mean, sports has always been my marker. It's how I judge success. I'm old-school. And our kids, they're just, um... They're different. You know, seeing Holly out there today with the dolphins. I mean, it was so cute. And I actually think that she was communicating with them. You know, I think that she was. Kevin with his filmmaking, I... haven't exactly been supportive. It's no secret that I'm trying to turn him into a ballplayer, but... I don't know if that's right. Yeah, and maybe he will be a ballplayer. They got a lot of growing up to do. We teach them the best that we can and pray that they make the right choices. Oh, you're right. You're always right. I would never admit that in public... Yeah. ...of course, but... Some things never change. So what'd you do that for? You know they aren't saving any turtles. It's okay. I have a plan. All right, so this is Dad's office building. He said Winston has the camera, my camera. Yeah. So? So, it's in Winston's office. Oh, no. We both know what he's thinking, right? It's the only way. Without the camera, the bad guys win. Can I help? Uh, yeah, sure. Grab that bucket over there. Sure. It's time to feed Bernie. Ew. Dead fish. What'd you expect, spaghetti? So the post really worked, huh? Yep. We're getting well wishes from countries all around the world. - Okay, what's wrong? - I think we caused all this mess. Hey, no, stop. You two helped save Bernie and learned a valuable lesson about the ocean. I don't think he would have survived without you guys. How'd it go with Mom and Dad? You tell them? Kind of. What's "kind of" mean? Means Dad got a big promotion and thinks his boss is super awesome. Well, that stinks. Want me to talk to them? Well... The good news is the plan is to release Bernie soon. Yeah, unless Winston buys the place first. What was that? Nothing. Let's go. We got work to do. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. Work to do. Something sure smells fishy around here, Bernie, and it ain't the fish. I really need your help on this one, Big Guy. If you just do me this one favor, I promise I won't ask you for anything else. Well, hope I won't have to ask you for anything else. Kev, you asleep? Sweet dreams. Love you. Going somewhere? Gotta get my camera. You crazy? Maybe. Well, I'm coming with you. - Oh, no. - Oh, yes. Come on, listen. All right, you just go... What are you doing? I got Dad's skills. So are we doing this or what? All right. So according to Dad's schedule, the cleaning crew starts at 10:00. All right, I'll, uh... set this thing for 9:55. If we're lucky, we'll be able to get in and out in 15 minutes tops. All right. Oh, no. No, no, no. Come on, go! Go! Go now! I can't. I can't. Why not? It's a red light. Really? Look. Anybody? Listen, we don't have that much time. Do you wanna get in more trouble? All right? The law's the law. I can't do nothin' about it. Oh, brother. Yes. Here we go. All right, let's go. Hello. Oh, Mayor Winter. Hey. How did the, uh... How'd the vote go tonight? Really? Well, that's spectacular. That's good news indeed. Yeah. What, it was unanimous? It's him. We gotta go. I gotta get my camera. Mayor, how many times have I told you not to worry? I mean, with income you're gonna see... Oh, no. ...from the chemical plant... Chuck's on the loose. - Why'd you bring him? - For backup. Yes, yes. What? Oh, no. Yeah, I've got the signed documents right here. Yeah. Bob Ryan, he pulled it off. Oh, the... the poor sucker. All right. Please be unlocked. Please be unlocked. Yes. Yes. Yes. Sweet! Yes. Oh, come on. Come on. Ah, there you are. Uh-oh. Oh, no. Well, well. Look who can't stay out of trouble. Juvenile delinquents. Your dad will be so, so proud. Oh, and you're thieves as well. Run, run, run. Go, go, go, go. Go. You know that, uh, breaking and entering is a very serious offense. No, you're the one that's in trouble. I don't think so. Bye. It was so good seeing you. You, too. We'll do it again, okay? Yes! Give me a call. See ya. - Help! Help! He's after us! - Holly? We have the evidence. Evidence? I... Let me see your phone. Let me see your phone. All right, just calm down. Who's after you? Him! He's after us! There he is! That is my camera! Thank you. Thank you for stopping these... these thieving kids! You're chasing children, sir? Hey, they broke in to my office. These are the Ryans' kids. I think you know them. Bob Ryan's kids? Oh, wow, I had no idea. I mean, come on. Look at the way they're dressed. It was in my office. It was dark. You know who we are, all right, and we have you and the mayor on tape. What are you talking about? Look, look, now that I know who you are, I think it's a little late. You know, I'm a little concerned about their safety. - I'm gonna take 'em home. - No. I'll take them home. Sure. That's a good idea. I'm just gonna take my camera, thank you. Do not touch them! What did you do? Oh, my goodness. That is a... That's a shame. Isn't that a shame? It really, truly is. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna pay for your phone, okay? And I think this should more than cover it. They were right. You are a mean man. Uh, so, um... That's my camera! No, we've been through this before. All right, uh, you just make sure to tell your father I want to see him first thing in the morning, okay? Big meanie! I saw that. Let's go. They're safe. That's all that matters. Thank you for taking care of them. Abby, it wasn't their fault. Mr. Ryan's boss, he's not a nice man. Broke Kevin's camera and my phone, too. Oh. I'm sorry, Sidney. If you'd like me to take a look at it, I'm pretty handy at fixing things. It'll take a miracle. Okay. I don't even know where to begin with you two. Sneaking out at night, taking my keys, breaking and entering. Dad, we're telling the truth. I can prove it. You realize that you could have went to jail. Go. Both of you, to bed. Now. - We'll talk about this in the morning. - But, Mom... I said bed. Holy moly. How am I gonna explain this one? I'm gonna be the first VP that never VP'ed. It'll all work out, honey. I talked to Sidney. She backs up their story. What? Winston. Ryan. What are you doing in here? I guess you must have heard about your kids breaking in here last night. Yeah. Yeah. You lied. I mean, you lied about everything, didn't you? Do some research to back up your play? Big fan of mine, huh? Luke Lawson. You used me to get to my old pal. Ryan, we keep files on all our employees. That's just standard company policy. "Come on, Bob. Do it for the team," just like good old Coach Dunn used to say, huh? What about that knee of yours? The bum one. Which one did you say it was? Is it the left or the right? Okay, um, why don't we just sit down and talk this through? Because I have the sneaking suspicion that you never even played baseball at all. I mean, you certainly never played football, because a worm like you wouldn't have the guts. All right, you know, get out of my office before I call the police. Why don't we call the police? What do you suppose we should talk to them about? Should we talk to them about the marine park or the big, beautiful, illegal chemical plant you're building? You know, Ryan, your, uh, signature's on those documents, too. If I go down, you're going down with me. And you do not want to come at me. Fifteen years of karate. Uh-huh. You know, Winston, I was gonna take the moral high ground with you, but, uh... Now you got a bum knee. But the worst part about it is... I actually trusted you, took your word over my own kids'. I'm gonna sue you for everything you have! That wasn't even the right knee. Morning. Morning. How 'bout some breakfast? Yes, ma'am. Where's Dad? Trouble today? He went in early, wanted to meet Mr. Mills, try to explain what happened. Sorry about last night, Mom. You know, it's not good, Holly. Whatever happened, your Dad's job is important to him. All right, we all make mistakes. I just hope this one works out. Morning, buddy. You okay? It depends on who's mad at me, I guess. Hey! I think it's working. - What, are you serious? Here. Let me see it. - Yeah, so... Hey, Kev, that's Sidney's phone. You shouldn't be snooping. Yes. It downloaded from the camera. It's here! Sidney, we got it. Hey, Bernie. What's wrong? This was delivered to my boss this morning. You were right. Winston Mills is planning to buy Marineland. Yeah, we'll see about that. Check this out. Where did you find it? Linked the footage from my camera to your phone. Mom fixed it. And watch this. Well, it better work. We're in way too deep for this thing to be exposed. Don't worry, Mayor. Within 18 months, we are gonna be in business. If this thing all goes as planned, it might just catapult you into a run for the governorship. Governor Brock Winters. That does have a nice ring to it. Got 'em, Mr. Mills... Well, those two should be in jail. I am so sorry. I got greedy. I was blinded. I hope you all can forgive me. It's okay, Dad. You were just doing what you thought was best. Yeah, that's all right. We all make mistakes. Mmm, thanks, bud, 'cause I just made a big one. I could be in some real trouble here. But we have the footage, right? Yeah. Oh, Winston and the mayor will have too much leverage over the judges in court. It'll be their word against ours. But what about the sanctuary? Sidney says he's gonna buy it and keep Bernie. What? Yeah, they got an "indunktion" letter. They can't release Bernie. "Indunktion"? - You mean "injunction"? - Yes. They're gonna put an injunction on releasing that dolphin? I don't know, Ab. Well... You're the brains of the outfit. What do you think? Well, we may not win in a court of law, but we have the footage, we have the Internet, and we have one secret weapon. We got Bernie, the dolphin. You're right. That's genius. What do you say, Kev? Give me a couple hours. Can I help you? Mr. Robert Ray Ryan? Yeah. Yeah, I'm Bob Ryan. Mr. Ryan, I'm Detective Wyatt. May I have a word with you, please? Yeah, sure. Do you have any idea why I'm here? Uh, yeah, pretty good idea. Are you employed by a Mills Realty Company, by one Mr. Winston Mills? That's right. And do you know the name... Luke Lawson? Who was that this early? That was a detective. What'd he want? He wanted my side of the story. What am I gonna do? I told him the truth. Mom, Dad, come here! Quick! Come here! I deny these charges. I'm gonna sue all of you! After a viral video was released on real-estate mogul Winston Mills and city mayor Brock Winters, both men have been arrested for investigation of a proposed massive real-estate scheme. Now, a third accomplice, still yet to be identified, was also arrested for stealing endangered turtle eggs. This is a huge misunderstanding. I continue to fight. It's an election year. Vote Brock Winters! Yeah, yeah. "Vote Brock Winters, the mayor of the state pen." We did it! We got 20,000 hits since last night. Let's go tell Bernie the good news. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Luke backed me up. I think he's feeling better. His sunburn doesn't hurt him anymore. Oh, I got some good news. Just received authorization from NOAA. Bernie can go home. Wait. Really? Mm-hmm. The longer he stays here, the harder it will be to adapt back to his natural environment. We're releasing him tomorrow. Tomorrow? We gotta find his pod and tell 'em Bernie's coming home. Did you hear that, Bernie? You can go home. Where are you? Come on. We're over here! Where are they? Come on! Please? Come on! Don't lose faith, all right? We'll say some prayers tonight. Hi. I'm Summer Sands, and with me today I have Kevin and Holly Ryan, our local kids whose viral footage unveiled real-estate mogul Winston Mills and city mayor Brock Winters' attempt to dupe the public into a fraudulent scheme by constructing a highly illegal and dangerous chemical plant under the guise of a seaside water park. So what gave you two kids the courage to do this? Well, Ms. Sands, it was really our dolphin friends. They saved us, so we had to help save them, too. If everyone helps, all the ocean animals can have a safe and happy home. Go, Bernie! I'm launching a video companion called The Dolphin Chronicles. Mm-hmm. It'll mainly focus on protecting the marine life and also tell... teach people how to respect their habitats. Wow. Well, there... There you go. True words of wisdom from our two young heroes. We'll be back with the actual release as it happens. I'm Summer Sands, reporting from the sunny beaches of St. Augustine, Florida. Back to you, Peter. Come on! Come on, guys! Bernie's coming home! Come on! Bernie's coming home! Let's go! Hey! Dad. Dad, maybe just stick to the human talk, please. Oh. Right. Here, dolphin, dolphin, dolphin. Come on, Bernie's family. That's them! Aw, come on. No, it's them. I'm not joking. Look! Are you kidding me? That... There they are! Yes! It's them! Are you kidding me, Kev? Yes! Yes! That's them? Yeah, that's them! I'm a... Yo! Yes. Whoo-hoo! Yo! We found 'em! You found them? The whole pod's out here, the whole family. Yeah. Hey, Bernie. Come on, buddy. You can do this. Come on, bud. Come on. The whole family's out there, man. - They're waiting for you. - Bye, Bernie! Remember to write. Holly, it's time. Me and Kevin will see him every day. We're his family, too. Come on, buddy. Yes. Okay, Bernie. You can do this. I know it, okay? Come on. Bye, buddy! Bye! Bye, Bernie! Bye-bye. Bye! We knew you could do it, buddy! We knew it! Hey, Bernie! Come here, babe. Come here, you little heroes. We did it. Bye, Bernie! Bye, Bernie! Bye, Bernie! Bye! See you tomorrow! This camera so rocks. Do a cartwheel here, Holly. Check this out, guys. Yeah, awesome. Here. All right, guys, this is the Ryan camp 2.0, baby. Oh, man, beautiful day out. Yeah. Hey, my turn. Wait. What? No... Okay, now you act. No, I'm the director. You're the one that's always in front of the camera. Here. Ready? Go ahead and end "Bernie's Journey" for me. And that's a wrap. Subtitles by explosiveskull
