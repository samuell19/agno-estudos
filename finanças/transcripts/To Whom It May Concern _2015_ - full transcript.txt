I know her, she's gonna realize she made a mistake, and i'll talk to her about it tomorrow. That's just... that's just how it works, i guess. Yeah... i'm sure. Right. You really saved me there, thank you. It's not a big deal. Oh, it is a big deal, because cops don't like me. All right. I'm gonna get out of your hair. - Yeah. - Thank you, again. Mmm-hmm. See you. Hey. It's after 3am, do you have a place to go? I don't know. But i'll figure it out. I have a couch... you could sleep in it. Are you sure? Yeah. So it's comfortable. I got it for friends and houseguests. But no one's ever slept on it. The guy at the store just told me it was good. This is great. Thank you very much. You didn't have to do this. Sheets... let me go get you some sheets. Okay. - Thanks. - Yep. Um, actually, i feel so dumb. We didn't introduce each other. - Oh. - I'm sam. Hi, anna. Nice to meet you, anna. And don't worry, i need to be at work really early in the morning. It would just be a few hours. Oh, okay. Well... sweet dreams. Just uh... yeah. you too. Just shut the door on your way out.

Listen, i need to ask you a favor. Do you think that you could watch nestor, just for today? Yeah. Who is...what... nestor? Yeah, my parrot. Oh, i don't know anything about... no, there's nothing to know. You don't have to know anything. I mean, my sister had a heart attack, she's in the hospital. I have to go see her. - Okay? - You're sister? that's terrible. Yeah, she's in the hospital with a heart attack. You know why? I'll tell you why. Because she talks too much. That's why her heart failed. She's always talked too much. Pain in the ass. Listen, so can you help me? I'm really, i'm really busy today. Well, i can't leave him alone. He gets depressed. Um. i'm... i can watch him. I could probably just watch him. - Yeah? - For a little, little while. Really? Oh, that's lovely! Oh, that's so, that's sweet of you. Here. here's his food. - I gotta go. - Okay, um... when are you... i'll pick him up when i come back. Bye. thanks a lot. Okay... what are you looking at? - Hey. - Hey. I'm on my way to work. I could give you a ride, buy you a drink. All right. - Thanks. - Sure. Anna's really special, isn't she? How did you guys meet? Well, we're neighbors. Really? she says you guys are friends. And coming from her, that means a lot. I mean, i don't know her too well but... nobody does. That's the thing with her. She's kind of a loner. Borderline autistic if you ask me. I only have 3 days left on my lease. Then i have to go. You can stay here until then, if you want. I appreciate this. You know the drill. Yeah. Good night. - Hi. - Hi. Uh, i'm here to get my bird, nestor. Um. one sec. She's here for the bird. Can you deal with her? She drives me crazy. Okay. here you go. Oh. Hello, nestor. - Thank you. - You're welcome. So, are you her boyfriend? Oh, no. no, i'm just a friend. - Just a friend? - Yeah. Well, isn't that the way it always starts? You'd make a nice looking couple. - You're such a good-looking young man. - Thank you. I never saw anna with anybody. I always thought she was... you know... gay. Well, if you never saw her with anyone, how could you speculate that she was gay? Oh, i don't know. Listen, if she doesn't want you, you could always come up and visit me sometime. I'll keep that in mind for sure. Come on, nestor. Let's go. Oh my god. Ooh, she's spicy. - Yeah... - i think she likes you. Yeah, i think she wanted me in the cage. I'm not, by the way. What? Gay. I could've told you that. What's on tv? Oh, uh, channels with a bunch of... nothing programming. I shut the cable off, because i'm moving. - I have to go to work. - Oh, oh yeah. i gotta go to work, too. Because i have a job that i have to do, i don't handle birds. Oh. okay. Hey, anna. it's me, katie. So i finally saw dad, yesterday. T was fucking weird. Apparently, he's been sober for five years. He has a job, he seems good and stable. He said he left you a few messages, he wants to reconnect with you, too. Call me if you want to talk. I hope... i'm sick of shitty beer. What do you want me to do? - Hey. - Hey. What's up? Do you need any help? Um, folding my laundry? no. Well, it's not the first time i folded... women's foldables. I'm sure you have. Hey, uh anna, is this yours? It is, i'm assuming it's yours, because you really, really wanted it in your hands. How many girlfriends have you had? Girlfriends, as in like... - girlfriend-girlfriends. - Girls who are friends? - Real girlfriends. - Real girlfriends. Okay... real girlfriends. I'd say, like five. Maybe six, if you count, my first love. Who was that? Her name was eva. And she was beautiful. We were 12. And she lived down the street. Wait a second. How are you in love when you're 12? What are you doing with a 12-year-old... it's pretty innocent. You know, it's mostly cute. What about you? I'm sorry, what? What about what? Who's your first love? I didn't have one. Oh, come on. Of course you had one. Everyone does. This isn't interesting. It's totally interesting. You asked me, i'm asking you. - Who was your first love? - No, i didn't... i didn't have one. Guess not everyone. Are you coming or... are you gonna help somebody else fold their laundry? Um... i was considering, but i'm coming. What? Nothing. Just looking at you. Is that problem? - I don't like it. - Okay, then i'll just look straight. What are you doing tonight? you working? Mmm-mmm. Well, i have this gig. You should come. Okay, great. You're coming. - Can i look at you now? - No. Okay. !¡sabor! - Cheers. - Cheers. Can we have two more please? That's the spirit. - How are you? - Good. - So, what'd you think? - No, it's great, i'm impressed. Oh, thank you. That girl. I'm surprised you got rid of her. She was all over you. What? Is that sexy? No, i mean it's sexy, but i mean, it's not everything. It's not about sex. It's different. It's about music, it's about dancing. It's fun. It looks fun. I... i wish i could do that. Wait, what, dance? To dance... to play... sing... yeah, you just look really happy. - Wanna try? - Huh? Oh, you heard me the first time. - You wanna try? - No. Can i have two more shots please? Come on, i'm gonna teach you. No, no, no. i'm good, i'm good. No, but she's gonna... just stop thinking. - Stop thinking. - Okay, okay, okay. Just let the music... let the music take over. Okay? Just let the music guide you. Here we go. And... mmm. There you go. You're dancing. Mmm. That wasn't so hard, was it? Good night. Sam? Are you asleep? Stop it. What? Stop. It's too soon. We shouldn't do this. We can't do this. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, anna. Can we just... can we just talk for now? Mmm-mm. I'm not good at talking. - Anna... - i'm fine. Oh, hey sam.

Break time is over, come on. Rachel texted me. She said, dot dot dot. "need to think." dot dot dot. What do you think the odds are of... rachel and me? 50/50. 50/50 is not good. Everything in life is 50/50, right? It's either it's good or it's bad... or it's gonna work or it's not gonna work... it's on or it's off... that's how it goes. Hey.

And i know that you've got rachel in your head... and i... i'm just not... i'm really just not really good at this kind of a thing. We just... maybe it's just better if we... just stayed friends. Friends. sure. Sounds good. - Yeah? - Yeah. This is where you work, huh? Yeah. this is where i work. You should consider joining next year. Next year... i don't really... like the beach that much.

I saw rachel with another guy. What do you mean, another guy? Another guy. What do you mean, another guy? where? Once at the bar. And then once in... the bathroom. What? The bathroom? Come here. In there. Look in there. - That's our bathroom. - I know. - Were you spying on us? - No. That's what it looks like. What do you think it looks like? - There's a hole that looks in the bathroom... - i'm not spying on you. I just... one day i heard some people... i thought you had left. And then a guy came... and i heard her. And i don't know what... i never looked before, but i looked, because i guess i... i wanted to see if you were there. You heard her? - What do you mean, you heard her? - I heard her. - What do you mean, you heard her? - Heard her... fucking another guy. I could see. I'm sorry. I'm sorry i just thought - you would want to know. - How could you be so sure. I mean you're looking through a hole, it's... i mean, it could be anyone... how can you be so sure it was her. Because i could... i recognize her shoes. And her robe. I saw her. It was her. How were they doing it? What do you mean? How were they fucking? Tell me! How were they doing it? He had her up against the sink. - Well was she enjoying it? - I don't know. - What do you mean, you don't know? - I don't know. - Was she enjoying it? - I don't know, i don't think that's what you should be thinking about right now. Well if... how was she... was she enjoying it? - Was she saying his name? - Yeah, well you know what? Yeah, yeah probably.
