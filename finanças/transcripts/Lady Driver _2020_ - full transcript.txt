Sit and have some breakfast. - Can't, you said so yourself, I'm gonna be late. - Sit. Fix your outfit please. - Yeah, seriously. - Shut up. - Ellie, don't talk to your sister like that. - Half sister. - Mom! - Vance! - Guys, make this woman happy. Or I'm gonna have to pay for it. - Okay. - I have a showing after school. So I need you here to watch Dakota. - Mom, no, I have my driver's test after school. You said I could borrow your car. - Ugh, well I'm sorry El. I totally forgot. - Mom, I've only talked about it every day this week. - Well we'll reschedule. - My permit's about to expire. When are we gonna reschedule it? - Ellie, we'll got to the DMV. It's driver's ed, not the end of the world. - Yeah, like you didn't do this on purpose. - Teenagers, am I right? - Ya kinda are. ♪ Born to be wild ♪ ♪ Born to be wild ♪ - Hey weirdo, you wanna race? Oh that's right, you don't have a car. Seriously, a skateboard? (school bell rings) - [Announcer] It's the last day of school, folks. Remember, clean out your lockers. What I find left behind becomes mine. - There she is. - What's up freak? - [Teacher] Look who I found loitering in the hallway. - She's late. - You've been making quite a habit out of this Ms. Lansing. She's all yours. - Sorry I'm late. - The final exam's already started. - She's gonna get an F, man. - Oh look, there's the nerdvicular, man. - Eyes on your tests, gentlemen. (tense music) - Thank you. - This one's firing, you can go ahead. - You know if you guys just go adding more air, you're gonna mess up... - I already rejetted the carburetor, Mr. Hicks. Air fuel ratio should be good. - Okay. And you didn't wanna take my class. - She's a natural. - I'd rather be driving a car than fixing one. - Well, you'll finally get your chance today. - Actually I won't. My mom won't be here on time with her car. - You just need a car? Use the shop car. - Does it actually drive? - It's registered and everything. Go on. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Now let's finish up. Oh, well then. - Let's try a left turn. All right, why don't you take her back in lot there and we'll try parallel parking. - Mm 'kay. - So are we partying this weekend guys, or what? - [Student] I hear Dice's parents are outta town. - No way, we gotta go. - Why don't you go ahead and try and park between those two cars up there. - No problem. - Oh hey, hey, hey, let me see that really quick. Let me see. Check this out, guys. (examiner yelling) No, look out. (exclaiming) (yelling) - Uh... Well okay. Well you passed, young lady. I need to get a new job. - Hey moron, you scuffed our soccer ball with your ugly car. (metal crunching) - Oops. - What the heck? - You knew I did not have time to come here today. What is this, punishment? And you wonder why I didn't want you to get your license. - So you did blow me off on purpose today. - Yes and you just proved that I was right to do so because the second you get your license you smash some kid's car. - Mom it was an accident. - Is that what you're gonna go with? It was an accident. There were a ton of witnesses, Ellie. - Mom, he started it. - Well insurance doesn't cover "he started it". - Vance can afford it. - Yes Vance can afford it and he's not going to because you are getting a job this summer and every dollar you make will go to pay for that poor kid's car. (boys laughing) (sighs) - [Vance] Well at least the cops weren't involved. - Yeah, not this time. She's just like her dad. - [Vance] Well, you may be right. - [Mom] God, her temperament and her attitude, it's just so much like Elliott. And I tried to give her a different life, we tried to give her a different life. - Maybe she would benefit from a more rigid learning environment. - She is already at the best private school in Monterey. I mean what are you talking about, boarding school? (sad music) (phone rings) - Hey. - You okay? - No. - Your folks pretty mad? - They don't even want me here. - [Friend] What are you talking about? - I just, maybe everyone'd be happier if I were gone. I just, I wanna get outta Monterey. I don't fit in here. And I got my license today. I can go anywhere. - [Friend] So what, you're gonna run away? - I don't know. - Be serious. They love you. You have a good life, Ellie. Where would you even go? - I wanna find out who my dad was. Where I came from. - You can't drive off, Ellie. New cars all have GPS. The cops can track you in a heartbeat. - Well maybe I don't need one of their stupid new cars. (dramatic music) Sorry, Mom.

This is quite the car. - I got rear ended in a parking lot a few days ago. Haven't had a chance to fix her yet. - Ellie Lansing, that's you. - That's me. - All right, well you just stay here, Ms. Lansing, you understand? - Yes sir. - Hey, is your head clear? (thoughtful music) (radio transmission garbling) - I thought you were taking me to the station. - All right, who's gonna sign? - Uncle Tim? (scoffs) - She's fine, Jess. Yeah, for real. 'Cause I'm looking at her right now. Uh yeah, yeah, she's just fine. Well now she is. So I. Why don't we take a step back, breathe. Take a step back. Jess, you need to calm down. We didn't really have a chance to discuss it. What more she knows, but also, let me ask her. All right. I hear ya. (sighs) (sighs) - Is she pissed? - Well I'll tell ya something. I don't know of a word in the English language that sums up how mad your mom is. Gimme a hand with this light. Pull that leg up. - Okay. Well she'll be much happier without me there, trust me. - [Tim] Really? 'Cause I'll tell ya she didn't sound very happy. - You got kids? - I do not have kids, no. - Then you don't know how much parents hate having them around. - Well that may be. But I do have parents. As frustrating as they can be, the good ones always love ya. That's a fact. - Have you been living here this whole time? - I do get out during the day sometimes. - Mom said she didn't know how to get ahold of you. - Okay well don't blame your mom for that, okay? I completely understand someone like me not fitting into your mom's new lifestyle. Okay? I don't have a problem with it. So you shouldn't have a problem with it. - But you're family. - Every family has a black sheep. Okay, who the hell's car is this? - Ah, this is the shop car from my school. - And they just let you take it? - I left a note. - You left a note when you stole it then is what you mean. Which is great. Now I gotta make another phone call tonight. - I'll handle it. - Okay well handle it before the police find out, okay? There's only so much Sheriff Cooper can handle. - Yeah, will do. - All right, I'm in the loft. Cot's for you. - You want me to sleep on that? - To be honest I don't really care what you do on it. But I'm going to bed. - Wow, you're a real charmer. - Or we could get back in the car and I could take ya home. - No thank you. - Then the cot. You understand me? - Yeah. This place is disgusting. - Well you know what, your dad almost lived here. And this crap was good enough for him. - My dad? (gentle music) - Soon as I wake up I'll take a look at your stolen shop car, see what I can fix. - It's something in the radiator system. Coolant leak maybe, I can fix it. - Well good. That's even better. Got my own crap to take care of. (sighs) (door creaking) (suspenseful music) (sighs) - Um. - Come on in, buddy. She's not gonna bite. That's my niece, Ellie. - Hi. I'm Merle. - Nice to meet you, Earl. - Oh no, it's, I'm Merle. - What did I say? - Earl. - What did you say? - Merle. - Merle, okay, got it. - Like Merle Haggard. - Yeah, of course, like Merle Haggard. - You two done over there? - I brought you a couple of breakfast sandwiches. And there's some fresh fruit that just came in this morning. And that's it. - What's that? - What? - Merle. You were just about to show me something. What was that? - Um, it's just, my mom said that women like men who smell good. So. - Is that right? So a man's gotta smell good for a woman to like him? Is that about right? - It doesn't hurt. - Well I guess I need to wear that stuff then. What's it's, what is that called, ultra? - Deodorant. - What will science think of next? - Okay I'm just gonna leave this here. - Thank you for coming buddy. - (chuckles) Here's another one. It's really nice to meet you, Ellie. - It's nice to meet you too, Merle. Ha. - Okay, so that boy's got a crush on ya. Let's take a look at this car of yours, see if we can get it back on the road. Okay, can't see from here, but let's make sure the lock washer's on the inside... - Or it'll back out. I got it. - Yeah, it'll back out. I gotta say, you know your engines. - Yeah, auto shop's pretty much the only class I got a decent grade in this year. And I didn't even wanna take it. - Why not? - Because being an auto mechanic wouldn't really make my mom that happy. No offense. - No, no, none taken. And you're probably right. But that doesn't mean you can't tinker under the hood in between doctoring and lawyering, you know. Whatever it is you wanna do. Plus ya save a lot on car repairs. - Tim, Tim that's it. I can make money doing this. - Yeah. You didn't know that. - No, I mean I could work here for you this summer. - Well I didn't know I was hiring, but... - My mom said I need a summer job and this could be it. - Well I think she meant down the block. Not a couple hundred miles away. - This is perfect. You said so yourself, I'm good at it. - Okay Ellie, look around this place, huh. This is not a place a teenager needs to spend a summer. You need to be back home at a shopping mall, getting into trouble or... - I need to work this summer and this is it. Now look, I know it. - Your mom would never go for that. - You don't know that. Let met talk to her. - Ellie. - Please Tim, I need this. (hopeful music) - What are you gonna do about the stolen shop car? - We could drive it back and that would be the perfect opportunity to talk to my mom in person. - No. Then I'd be there. - So? - You said you would talk to Jessie. There's no way, I'm not sitting down for that fire and fury, I, I... - A wise man once told me that the good parents always love you. - Well they don't always love the uncle. - Let's give it a shot. If my mom says no then I won't bring it up again, case closed. (sighs) (thoughtful music) I'm just gonna throw this in the truck. - Sounds good. (sighs) Thank you for letting this happen, Jess. - I'd be lying if I said I felt good about it. But I haven't seen her this happy in a long time. - Well she's got some real skills around cars, I'll tell ya. And I'm gonna enjoy the help. - Just gotta grab the last of my stuff. - I'll take good care of your girl. - Better than you've been taking care of yourself I hope. - I probably deserve that. But I won't let ya down. - This is it. - Okay. Okay. Be good. - Thank you. (hopeful music) We're back? - (sighs) Something tells me you didn't sleep all that well last night. - Please, I had a deluxe cot in auto bay. How could I not? - Oh come on. You just got upgraded off the shop floor. - My my. - You all good? - Better than ever. - All right then. - So what are we doing tonight? - You're looking at it. You're gonna unpack, I'm gonna go upstairs, I'm gonna go to bed. - No way. Show me around town or something. - You were asleep like 10 minutes ago out in the truck. - Yeah, well I'm not anymore. Come on, what did you and my dad used to do around here? - Well the same thing we did every Saturday night. - Okay cool, so what. - I don't think so, Ellie. - Why, was it a strip club or something? - It's nothing bad, it's just nothing I have any desire to do anymore. - I just wanna know what my dad used to do. Come on, please? - You normally have success with that level of please? - Yes. Otherwise I wouldn't continue using it. - Let's just drive by, all right? - Ta da. (upbeat music) This place is awesome. - [Tim] Yep, every weekend, standing room only. Lotta energy here, huh? - Mm hmm. Hey Merle. Whatcha doing here? - Uh, I come here almost every weekend. Everybody does except for your uncle. - Well I'm certainly glad to see him. Hey Tim. - How you doing, Loretta? This is Ellie, by the way, she's my niece. She's staying with me for the summer. - Well hello young lady. Welcome to Petaluma. - Thank you, thank you. - You know we should probably get inside, they're getting ready to start. - We actually just stopped by to take a look at the track. You guys go ahead. - Oh no, we should go in. - No, Loretta, we don't have tickets or anything. - Oh we got plenty of seats. Come with me. - Loretta, El! - We're going. - [Announcer] Need some strategy here driving. There is some speculation this weekend by some people. (engines revving) (crowd cheering) - This place was our whole world. - [Announcer] 23 holds onto the lead coming out of curve number two. - It was? - We spent every waking moment here. If we weren't racing we were watching, studying. - Studying. Doesn't look that hard. I mean you just go in circles. - Yeah. You just go in circles. About 90 miles an hour. And if you make one tiny mistake, the only forgiveness to be had is dealt out by a concrete wall about five feet away. - Tell me more. - [Announcer] Number 22 with Reed, trying to take over Hendrix in 27. - It's the only thing I've ever done in my life where when you're doing it it's the only thing that matters. (engines revving) - [Announcer] And that's the white flag, only one lap to go. (whistling) - What is that smell? - That's methanol. These babies don't run on pump gas, special race gas. Ah, okay they locked the gate to the parking lot. I'm gonna have to go around the side. Stay here, I'll get the car. Tommy, keep any eye on my niece. They locked the gate. I'm gonna go pick up the car, okay? Thank you. - [Tommy] Sure thing, Tim. See that tire on there. - This is so cool. Oh my god. - Ah yeah, I see that. - Wow. - I see that. - [Man In Truck] Need a ride, little lady? - Uh, no, I'm just waiting for my uncle. - So you don't wanna ride with tonight's big winner? - Did you race tonight? - (laughs) Yeah. And I won. - You're kidding. Are you Buck McCreadie? - That's my name, don't wear it out. - [Ellie] I got a question. - Huh? - Is it really so hard to just race in circles? - That's the hardest kinda racing there is. - That seems to be the standard response. - What was that? - Nothing. - It's your first time to the race track? - Yeah, I live in Monterey. I'm just visiting Petaluma for the summer. - You should let me show you around town then. - Is there really much to see? - Is there much? Darlin', Petaluma has all the hot spots. We got a Waffle House, less than 20 miles away. (Ellie laughs) Cracker Barrel under 30. - Oh Cracker Barrel, yeah. - [Tim] El, you good? - Yeah. I just met the king of the oval track. - Yeah? Is that what he told ya? - You know it's true, Tim. - What are you doing slumming around the old Petaluma track, Buck? - Just keeping my skills sharp. Racing Calistoga next weekend. - I thought your whole family was banned from Calistoga Speedway after your old man got DQed so many times. - You throwing shade at my dad, Tim? Won a lot more trophies than you ever did. Though yours do look real nice sitting in that garage of yours. (chuckles) Nice to meet you, Ellie. - You too. - She's 16. - Yeah, and I'm 19. That used to be marrying age. - Back off. - All right Tipsy Tim. (laughing) - He seemed nice. - Oh Ellie, come on. - Well he seemed nice until you go there. What, do you have history with Buck? - Nothing other than the fact that I used to race with his old man. - Is he the reason why you quit? - 'Cause of Buck's idiot father? I didn't give two shits about him. - Oh yeah, sure. Doesn't sound like it. - Well, that's the truth. - Can you tell me more about the racing or my dad? You guys were close, right? - El, there's gotta be a reason your mother never brought it up. - What? What reason? - I don't know, you'd have to ask her. - No, I'm asking you. - Look, Ellie, I'm really glad that you're here. And I have loved every minute of getting to know my brother's little baby. But I can't read your mother's mind. (gasps) - Are you okay? - I'm gonna stop. (panting) That's gotta be something I ate. - Must've been everything you ate. - Would you mind driving us home? - What good's a license if I don't use it? - Good point. Thanks for driving, huh? - [Ellie] Yeah. You gonna be all right? - Yeah, yeah, I'm just gonna grab a couple things outta the office. (thoughtful music) - Thanks for tonight, Tim. I really loved the racing. - Yeah. I used to as well. 'Night El. - Mornin'. - What are you doing? - I thought this place could use a good cleaning. - What the hell kinda teenager are you? - The kind that works here now. I gotta earn my paycheck. - Okay, well this just in. You don't have to work on Sundays. - I am not taking my first day off. Now come on, you too. I'm not doing this by myself. - Well I'm gonna need a cup of coffee to keep up with you today. (Ellie laughs) (sighs) - So you had a race car, right? - I did. - What happened to it? - I don't know. - Is that right? - That's right. - 'Cause what is under that tarp over there, Tim? - Ellie Lansing, you stop right where you are. - [Ellie] I can't help but notice this giant massive thing... - I wouldn't do that if I were you. (coughing) I told you not too. - This is a race car? - It's a modified. I know visually it's an acquired taste, but it's, it's exactly what you saw running last night at the speedway. - Did you ever win in it? - I did, yeah. As a matter of fact the car you're looking at held the Petaluma Speedway record for quite some time. - How? You drop it from a plane? - (laughs) There's the old man of yours. - Yeah? Does it run? - Nah, it's pretty much just a big paperweight at this point. - Well can we try and turn it over? Where are the keys? - The keys. Hmm. I don't know, actually. - I call bullshit. You made this big decision to quit racing. And then you carefully covered up your car. And then what you just tossed your keys into the corner? - Well that's not exactly how it went down, no. - Where are they? - Why don't you check in the trophies back there. - Which one? - Try the smallest one. - That doesn't really narrow it down for me. (Tim laughs) - Son of a. Ellie. - It is in none of those. - Come here, come here. That's a race car. - Yeah? - It's not your momma's Mercedes. Doesn't have keys, doesn't have a blip, blip, blip. No keyless entry, there's no... - Okay. - Six. - Okay, okay, - disc changer in the trunk. - You're real funny, you know that? How do I start it? - Well just to turn it over it's gonna need a new battery. No telling what else is wrong with that. - Okay, well let's get it a battery. - Shh. Just the adult needs a minute, okay? Plus we have another car to work on. Think you're gonna like this. ♪ Wake up, today's the day ♪ ♪ We gotta get things underway ♪ - Okay. That should do it. Twist it. - Yeah? (engine revs) - Okay kill it, kill it. Whoo! - Oh! Tim that sounded amazing. What is this? - That is a Chevy LS9. Pretty much the holy grail of street power plants. - Must be for a very special customer. - Very. I gotta tell you, you're turning out to be a gear head. Mighta found your calling. - Yeah? So can we work on the race car next? - You ever think of anything else, anything at all? - Not today I don't. - What about food? Can I interest you in some food? - If we must. God, where's Merle when ya need him? - Well Merle's probably still nursing a nacho hangover. - So why'd you stop racing? - Oh really? - Okay, when did you stop racing? - You're relentless, aren't you? Like a dog with a bone. (Ellie barks) I stopped after your dad died, you know. - But you loved it, you said so yourself. - Yeah well I did then I didn't. - Hey, dirt track. Let's check it out. - Nothing to check out, it's closed. - I just wanna see it during the day. Please? - What the hell, but then after we eat. Okay? - Yeah. (horn honks) - How you doing, Rocko? Just gonna show the kid around if that's all right. - You're good, Tim. - Thanks, buddy. (engine revs) (tense music) - What are we doing? - Well you said you wanted to see the track, right? So what the hell. Let's see the track. (rock music) (Ellie exclaims) (laughing) - Whoo! (screams) Okay, okay. - So what do ya think? - Can we do it again? - Why not? Your turn. - What? - What good's a driver's license if you're not gonna use it? Swap spots. Drop it in first, go easy on the clutch. Just easy, delicate on the gas. There ya go, there ya go. Feel it. There's a lotta power, so go easy. Up to second before the corner. - [Ellie] Okay. - Looks nice, El, that's beautiful, El, beautiful. (whimpers) Yeah! - Who the hell's that? - I think it's Tim Lansing's old car or pieces of it anyway. - I think you're right. Let's have some fun. - Brakes, brakes, brakes, brakes. - We're good, we're good. - Whoo hoo hoo! - Wouldn't you know that's Buck. (guys laughing) - Think we can take him? - Maybe 30 years ago when this rolled off the assembly line. Not now. - Yeah, yeah buddy, come on. - Catch 'em, catch 'em. - Come on, old man, let's see what you got. - [Tim] All right, enough of this crap. Lose him. (engines revving) - Yeah, here we go. Okay, okay. Yep, yep, yep. - All right, all right, all right. - Stay on your line, keep him in sight. - Okay, you gotta catch him, catch him, now catch him. - All right, so roll on the power, up to third, up to third, up to third. - Old man's still got some skills. - Now it ain't worth hurting your truck, now Buck. Easy takes it. - That's what insurance is for. - Okay. - Yes, El! El. - I lost him. - He's high and wide, El. High and wide. Son of a. Gonna hit us, El. Brakes. - What are you doing, Buck? Buck, Buck, Buck. - Hey, you okay? - Yeah, we're fine. - Both of ya? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You watch yourself and that diving late apex crap. You understand me? - Hey. Who the hell was driving? - Hey, aren't you the king of the oval track? - No shit. - Why don't you bring that car by the shop and we'll see if we can't buff that out for ya. - That was a girl. - Yeah, no shit, Kenny. - Wow. (Buck sighs) - [Ellie] Did you see his face? - Why don't you swing by the shop and let me buff it out? I almost peed myself. (laughing) You are more like your dad than I could've imagined. - What do you mean? - Oh, he never backed down from a fight. Even once he knew he couldn't win. I mean I got more bumps and bruises and scraped up knuckles than you could imagine defending him. (thoughtful music) - Is that a good thing or a bad thing? - I don't know. Maybe it's just a thing. - Okay. Now I'm starving. (patrons murmuring) - [Tim] Okay. - [Hostess] Hi Tim, nice to see you. - [Tim] Good to see you too, Grace. All righty. - You should race again. - Let's just enjoy what happened today and let's leave it there. That's my suggestion. - I could be on your race team. Help you fix up your car, we could show Buck what a real driver can do. - Racing is behind me, Ellie. - It doesn't have to be. - Come on, it's a young man's sport. I know that and I've accepted it. You need to accept it. - Well what about a young woman? - Oh boy. - You could be on my race team. Show me the ropes. - El you came out here to work in the shop for the summer. That's a promise that I made your mother. - I can't break that... - I can still work in the shop. - We would only race on the weekends, right? - Your mother would kill me if I put you behind the wheel... - She knows that you race. It wouldn't be that big of a surprise. - No Ellie, El! Your dad didn't just die in a car wreck. He died in a car wreck on that track. - My dad raced? - Yeah your dad raced. (solemn music) My brother was the best friend I've ever had. We did everything together. Of course he raced, El. - What happened? - He went on his lid exiting turn two and we think a fuel line most likely ruptured and the car caught on fire. The flames spread pretty quickly, so quick nobody had time to really do anything. You know? (explosion booms) Nobody had time. - Why would my mom keep that from me? - Oh come on, El. Your mother was nine months pregnant the night it happened. She was welcoming you into the world and saying goodbye to a husband the same moment. Your birth is always gonna be tied to his death. And I don't think she ever really had any chance to process it properly. I mean I was overwhelmed. Suddenly the shop was a one man operation. Your mother met Vance, they went to Monterey. - That's not fair. It's not fair what she did to me or to you. - You can't blame your mother for that. What's not fair is losing a husband that you love. - Or losing a dad. - And I'm sorry for that. - Thank you. - And that was when your dad got this perfect opportunity to pull out the shotgun. - No way. - And shoot. It works too. Gimme the 15, will ya? Like scared the crap out them. I'll tell ya something, they didn't mess with us ever again. - How old were they again? - I mean Otis had to be nine. Okay. I don't think there's anything here we can do until the differential ships at least. - You know what that means. - Don't say it. - Race car. - El, I think we talked about this. Neither one of us are driving that thing. - Yeah, yeah, we don't have to. We can just clean out the cobwebs and tinker with it when we get home from being lawyers or whatever. - Do you remember every single thing that I say to you? - Tim, I'm here to work on cars for the summer. And I want the next one to be that one. (Tim sighs) - Okay. Where are you going? - It needs a new battery, if I'm not mistaken. (thoughtful music) - You are not mistaken. (engine chugging) Shut it down. - Whoo! Let's get this baby on the road. - The road? What kinda car do you think this is? This baby runs on dirt. - Okay, let's get her dirty. - [Tim] Okay. Let's see what this baby can do. - Who's driving? - Who do you think is driving? - Well I don't know, I did most of the work on her. - You did most of the work? - Well I was in the top two. - Okay, this baby hasn't seen the dirt in 15 years. And you think I'm not gonna be the first one to drive it? - I could live with that. - So could I. - You know it's really more of a young man's... What'd you just say? - Try these on. See what you can do. (Tim sighs) Okay. Now the mud's pretty tacky out there. That means the car's gonna feel pretty loose. And as you roll on the power, the back end's gonna step out so you be ready for that, okay? - Yeah. - Only left turns. The best left turn is when the steering wheel's pointing to the right, okay? (rock music) Whoo hoo hoo hoo! How did that feel? - [Ellie] Awesome! - I'll tell ya, you look good out there. Really good. I don't think I've ever seen that kinda car control on a first drive in my life. - [Ellie] That was awesome. - You're a Lansing. (sighs) (Tim grunts) 'Kay, you know what, let's roll it into bay two. Give a couple cranks to the right. - You know, this is a great car, Tim. - I always knew she was. - Yep. It's a real shame that she just has to sit here in the shop all day. - El. - It was built to be on that track, Tim. - Ellie, stop. - It is a genie, Tim. - I'm sorry, what? - What you have here is a magical, all powerful creature that is just spending year after year stuffed in this crappy old lamp. - You are good. - Rub the lamp, Tim, set the genie free. Let it fly through the dirt. - Okay there's absolutely nothing that could convince me to let you do dirt track this summer. I'm sorry, it's... - Shop open? - Hey Buck, what are you doing here? - Ah, you guys said you could help out with my truck. So. - You paying cash? - No actually. The insurance lady was real sympathetic when she heard about the hit and run I suffered. - Is that right? - Yep. This is your old race car here? - It is. - You donating it to a museum or something? - No, no we took her out in the old field over there. She handled so nicely. - Real nice for a relic I'm sure. You know you should take my car out for a few laps around the track. You're a pretty good driver. - You think? - Yeah. - You know I think we're all good with the relic here Buck. Thanks for dropping by. I'll let you know about your truck. (horn honking) - Yeah, I'm coming. - Your mom waiting for you? - No, Kenny's giving me a ride home. I meant what I said earlier about you trying out a real race car. You just let me know. Possibly get us access to Calistoga Speedway. - Shut up! - Mm hmm. - I mean no, thank you. I wanna earn my trip there. - All right then. Suit yourself. Hey, I need it by Friday, Tim. - I'll see what I can do. - Maybe spend a little less time on your stupid race car and a little more time working, huh? (horn honking) Yeah, I said I'm coming, Kenny. Bye Ellie. - [Ellie] Bye Buck. - Gotta make sure it's okay with your mom first. - Yes, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. - Okay, there's no guarantees here, all right? We're just gonna take a little bit of time and see if we can get you ready. That's it. - Oh I'm prepared. I'm ready. - This is up to you. - I got the best teacher in the world. - Ya think? (Ellie laughs) (hopeful music) - Okay, let's get you registered, get you past tech inspection, pay a quick fee and get you some seat time. (energetic music) Okay. First of all this is not an open field. There's walls here. Let's just take it slow at first, okay? - Who the hell am I kidding? You're gonna put your foot through the floorboard as soon as you get out there aren't you? (Ellie laughs) Get in the car. (engine rumbles) (upbeat music) (engine revs) (Tim exclaims) - No, no, no. (growls) - Okay well that sucked. - Yeah. - Look, I want you to find the edge. But do it gradually, okay? We creep up to the edge. When you approach the corner, select your line and commit to it. It's a lot easier than later when there's 10 cars trying to ram into you, okay? - Yeah, yeah, got it. - Make me proud. (engine rumbles) (upbeat music) (engine revving) Test one two, test one two. - God? Is that you? - Yes, Ellie, as a matter of fact it is God. I'd like you to pay attention to everything your uncle tells you from now on. - I'm hanging up on you. (Tim laughs) - Okay, I think we're good. - Yeah, paces, buddy. - Wow. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it for myself. - Buck, what are you doing here? - Yeah, aren't you supposed to be up in Calistoga slamming into a wall? - That's good. No, I'm leaving in the morning. I got a buddy racing here tonight, I told him I'd come check him out. Now I'm real glad I stayed. - We got the car in great shape. - Love the enthusiasm. Just try and keep it in one piece. - Not a problem. - Yeah, we're all good here, Buck. But thanks for dropping by, huh? - All right. Good luck out there. - Thank you. See? Told you he was nice. - Yeah. Punk that tried to slam into the side of my car's a real winner. - Okay, everyone's got their flaws, Tim. - Are you gonna be able to focus out there? - Yeah, I got Lansing blood in these veins. You tell me. (chuckles) - Yeah, you'll be fine. (hopeful music) - [Announcer] It's a sunny day here at the Petaluma Speedway. We're got 40 laps of dirt sliding and pushing your cars to the limit. Now, you've got to be sharp out there or you'll end up in the wall. - Wakey, wakey, El. How you doing out there? - I'm not gonna lie. Got me some jitters. - Comes with the territory, kid. How's the car feel? - Feels good, Uncle. - Then let's see if she's still got a little life left in her, huh? - [Announcer] Welcome to this young lady. Ellie Lansing is car 18. All right folks, we're moments away as the green flag is about to fly. (rock music) (engines revving) - [Ellie] Hey, that bastard took my line! - Can't call dibs, kid. Stay focused. - [Announcer] 76 with a nice slide on the inside, passing rookie Lansing. - [Ellie] Dammit, I'm getting passed. - Don't worry about the other cars, El. You're out there learning. You're sliding wide, kiddo. Need to slow down the entry. - Okay. - [Announcer] The track's getting slick as we put in the laps. - Opportunity'll present itself. Be patient. - [Announcer] Nice move by the rookie in car 18. - Beautiful, beautiful. - I can't find an opening. - That's a Puffer in front of ya. It means he can make himself wide, hard to pass. - [Announcer] This is a promising start for Lansing in 18. She can drive! - Good job El, good job. Down on the power. - I got it, I got it. - No, no, no, no. - [Announcer] Ooh, looks like young Lansing in 18 has spun out. - Oh come on! - You okay? - I'm fine. The clutch is out but it's not moving. Something's broken. - And it appears she's having trouble with the car now. - Okay, sit tight and I'll tow you out. - [Announcer] Tough break for the newcomer. Better luck next time. (disheartening music) - Okay, well this column's definitely stripped. But I can get it retapped before next weekend. - Forget it. - What was that? - I said forget it, okay? I don't know what I'm doing out there. - You just got your license a few weeks ago. You think you're gonna miraculously know how to run on the dirt? - I thought it'd be easier. - I thought a lotta things'd be easier. Turns out that the things worthwhile just aren't. Maybe I was wrong, huh? Maybe we should quit. - No, I don't want to. - [Tim] What? - I said I don't want... - What was that? - I said I don't want to, okay? I'm just pissed. - Hey lady driver. - We'll finish this later. - Whoo! Thought I said you should keep the car in one piece. (chuckles) - Oh yeah, you know I forgot about that. That was some good advice. You know next time, McCreadie. - So you're gonna try this again, huh? - Yeah, yeah I can't quit now, just when I'm getting good. - (laughs) Oh you gotta funny definition of good. I think you took four cars out at once. - Don't worry, I told the insurance lady some guy cut me off. (laughs) - Well you keep plugging away, lady driver. Oh and you know if this doesn't work out maybe you could pose in a magazine or something. Keep that dirt on you. It's hot. - Back up, Buck. Too close to my niece. Back up. - All right. - See you ladies on the podium. I'll be the one on top. - Definitely starting to see some flaws. - Finally. - When do I get to race him? - You don't. You race modifieds, he races late models. - I don't see that much of a difference. - Yeah well you buy one, you'll know the difference. You need a big dog sponsor for something like that. - Well how do I get that? - Wins, a lotta wins. The only currency a sponsor respects is victory. - I can do that. What else? - (sighs) A team. We need a team. Easy, Merle. - I got it. - This is our great race team? - Even have an office coordinator as well. Hope you don't mind sharing your bedroom. - Yeah, whatever it takes. - Good, because we have six days 'til the next race. - Yeah, can do boss. - It's coffee. Like I told ya. I'm committed as long as you are. Merle, both hands, buddy, both hands.

What's that? - Oh, Protect the Harvest. Nationals at Lucas Oil Speedway. - What is that? - It's like the Superbowl of dirt racing. Thought we could use it for motivation. - We can put it by Tim's trophy shrine. - Yeah, won't he get mad that? - I can handle Tim. Come on. - [Merle] I bet you can. - Will you roll it down? - Yeah. That looks good. - Yeah. So I'll see you at the track tomorrow? - Yeah. We're gonna win this time, Ellie. Go Team Ellie! - Go team! Why am I not winning? - Gees kid. You're young. You just started driving. Have some patience. - No, I've been racing over a month now. - That's nothing. Half the kids out here at the track, they've been racing since their feet could touch the pedals on a go-kart. - No, I'm missing something, Tim. Or maybe I'm just not as good as you thought I was. - You're better than I thought you were. - Then what's wrong? - Kid, there is an intangible component that goes with every dream. Sometimes it's desire, sometimes it's heart, sometimes it's making a peace. But only you're gonna know where that is. Your dad found it before I could. - He was better than you? - Oh god, yeah. He coulda driving late models on the pro circuit or anything with a steering wheel for that matter. - Well why didn't he? - Finances. He had a family to think about. Your mom and you were on the way. It's called responsibility. - But you think he coulda won? - I know he coulda won. (thoughtful music) - I wanna race late models. - Listen Ellie, I know you want to. But it's probably not gonna happen this summer. There's a couple of variables that are missing. Wins and funding. - What if I talk to Buck, see about maybe his sponsors coming and taking a look at us? - Well why don't you call the devil while you're at it? We could have hell for a sponsor. - Tim. - No, hey think about this. We'd have flames going down the side of the car, horns coming outta the radiator. - Tim? - We'd have a tail with a trident... - Tim! - Don't interrupt me. I think we're onto something here. - Your nose is bleeding. - Ah yeah, that's probably the dry weather. Listen, you better get some sleep. We got a race tomorrow. - You okay? - Yeah. I don't think I'm gonna bleed out before daylight, okay? Get some sleep. - Okay. Goodnight. (upbeat music) - [Announcer] As we enter lap 20 this is turning out to be quite a night of racing. - You're looking really smooth out there, El. You eat your Wheaties this morning? - My dad spoke to me in a dream last night. Gave me the secret. - Yeah, what did he say? - [Ellie] Wouldn't you like to know? - [Announcer] The track is finally slicking up as everyone's flying through the turn. Number 18, Ellie Lansing looking to make a move. (engine revs) (metal crunching) (crowd exclaiming) Looks like a caution flag out there. Henson and Flanders had a small collision just before turn one, coming outta the straight away. We're gonna make sure they're okay. Once the cars are cleared to the infield, the race can get back underway. (engines revving) That's the green flag, ladies and gentlemen. And we're back in action. - Go Ellie! (Loretta cheers) - [Announcer] There's another pass by young Lansing. Lansing's now in podium position! - Beautiful El, beautiful. You got two to wide, three to check and you're P3. Could be your first podium. Hold onto it. - There are two other spots in that podium you know. - That a girl, Ellie. (upbeat music) (clinking) Okay El, stick your nose up high. Low, low, low, low, low, low, clear. Clear, clear. - Josie in the lead, but Lansing closing in. - All right, come on Ellie! - Come on Ellie! - Inside, El. (crowd cheers) Come on! - [Announcer] Looks like it's gonna be sprint to the finish. And there's the checker! Josie in first, (cheering) Lansing in second. - Yeah, second! - [Announcer] Followed by Henson in third. - Ellie, good run! - She did it. - You got a lotta heart. You ran a great race. - Thanks, you too. - [Announcer] Let's hear it folks, for our second place finisher, Ellie Lansing. (cheering and applauding) - And our first place finisher, let's hear it for Brian Josie. (cheering and applauding) (thoughtful music) - I have cake. - What? Why? - Uh, my mom was so impressed last night she wanted to make you a little something. - Let me see. Aw, that's so cute. - I know, right? Smells good. You got it pretty good, Ellie. - Yeah? - Yeah. Racing cars all summer, living with Tim. Tim! It's pretty cool. - I guess. I just, I wish I was winning more. - This is a winner's cake, Ellie. - But I didn't win, Merle. Why is everyone so psyched? - You were on a podium. - Yeah, but second place isn't winning though. - Ellie you don't have to be on top of the podium to win, okay? Appreciate what you've got. - Who's on the podium? - Mom? - Congrats, Ellie? - No, no, no, Mom. - Jess! - Ellie's racing? - Yes, she's racing. What are you doing here? - I don't need a reason to come and check on my kid. - Listen Jess, I thought you were aware of her racing. There's no way that I... - In what world Tim, do I approve of Ellie Lansing racing a car? I thought she was just working here. - And she is working here, very hard. We just thought the racing might be something that she... - No, the racing can't be anything. - Okay, could you just let me please talk to Ellie? - We will both talk to Ellie. - Mom, I'm sorry, okay? (Tim gasps) I didn't. I. Tim? Tim? Mom? - Call 911. - Is he breathing? - Tim. - Tim. - [Woman On PA] Dr. Retkey to OR 1. Dr. Retkey to OR 1. (Tim sighs) - [Jessie] That's a hell of a way to get out of an argument, Tim. - Well you know I hate getting screamed at. Hey kid. - How are you feeling? - Like I got punched in the gut about 85 times. - Doctors say that your liver function is down to about 30%. Alcohol related cirrhosis. - That's not good. - So bed rest, lots of meds and we'll see. (thoughtful music) (siren wails) - Jess, you mind if, you mind if I talk to El for a minute? - [Jessie] Okay. - She's pretty pissed, huh? - I don't think there's a word for just how pissed she is. (laughing) (wincing) - Don't make me laugh. - I'm sorry I lied to you. - You know that's not the point. Right? You don't lie to family. - I know. - Look, I screwed up, kid. I walked away from my family and then my whole life fell apart. But you made me realize you get one of those. That's the most important thing you'll ever have. I love you, kid. - I love you too. - You do me a favor, all right? While you're out there, if you see a nurse, you tell her to use a smaller needle next time. (Ellie laughs) - Okay. You look so happy there. - I was. - I wish I could've seen Dad race. - Yeah me too. - I'm sorry that I didn't tell you I was racing. - I'm sorry I didn't tell you about your dad. - Tim said he was pretty good. - Mm hmm. He was the best. - Do you ever miss it? - I miss him. But no, I have a better life in Monterey. For you and me. - Tim thinks I'm pretty good. (Jessie sighs) - Tim doesn't really know anything else. He doesn't know what other possibilities are out there for you. - Mom, I think I'm pretty good too. - Ellie, dirt track racing is not a living. It's a side gig. And I bet working in this shop for the summer was a whole lot of fun. But are you really gonna spend the next 50 years working long hours in a shop so you can go race on the weekend? - I don't know. You know I don't know about the next 50 years. But I know about right now. I know that this matters to me. This all matters to me. (thoughtful music) This is what I need from you, Mom, this is what I actually want. (sighs) - [Woman On PA] Paging Dr. Moore, you're needed in post op, paging Dr. Moore, you're needed in post op. (sighs) - What? - Seven days a week, this, same stuff. What would it take to get me some grape Jello? (laughing) - I mean you must be feeling better if this is the biggest problem you have. Grape. You ornery old fart. - Yeah. You're probably right. How's Ellie doing? - She and Merle have that shop handled. You're gonna be out of a job. - Hope they don't fire me. I need the insurance. You know that little girl of yours is the best thing to happen to me in 16 years. - She's loved every minute of this summer with you. - She gave me some great memories. To replace some pretty bad ones. - Is she really that good? - Hand me my phone. Watch that. That is her first podium. Better than Elliott and I ever were. Her instincts, her car control. - Shit. - Jess you can't teach that. - Mm. - Can you pass me a quarter inch? - Uh yeah. I told Scooter we'd have this done by tomorrow. - Yeah no, I get it, Scooter wants his car. I'm doing the best I can. - Hey guys. How's it going? - Merle is PMSing again. - You're the PMSer. - Oh well, I don't think that Scooter's truck's gonna get done on time. - I told you. - Why? - 'Cause we have another car to work on. - Mom, we're kinda swamped here. - Oh. Well I just thought that when I told my race team that we had work to do that they would hop to. - Your race team? - Yeah, Tim didn't think it was the right time to call it. So he put me in charge. - Mom, seriously? You're gonna run the team? - Yeah, this was my world as much as Tim's. And I can't think of a better driver I'd like to run the race team for. - [Merle] Yes! Thank you! - All right, all right. - Yeah all right. Yeah. - We got work to do. - We've been working on Tim's car on the side. It's ready to go. - Oh. Yeah but you, you can't run Tim's car in late model. - But we don't have a late model car. - Mm, uh oh. You better not say that to your new big sponsor. - Mom, what's going on? Mom, what's going on? Mom, Dakota's our new sponsor? Vance are you serious? Hey munchkin, I missed you. - I missed you too. - Oh my... - I made you this. - What is this? This is amazing. Thank you! You guys, you guys bought a late model? - All we need now's a driver. - You got it, thank you! - Our pleasure, El. - Oh my god. - Now who's this guy? - This is the brains of the team, Merle. - Nice to meet ya, Earl. - It's Merle. - It's what? - It's Merle. - Okay. Like Merle Haggard. - Where are we racing where we're going to need all of this? - Well it's not Petaluma. - No, we are entered in the $100,000 to win Protect the Harvest Nationals at Lucas Oil Speedway. - That's the Superbowl of dirt track. - Yes, I mean it's the biggest race of the season. And it's in Wheatland, Missouri. - We're going to the Superbowl. - We're going to the Superbowl. - In Wheatland. (girls laughing) - All right. One last thing. Are you okay if I'm your spotter? - Female spotter, I don't know. - Yeah. - What do you think, Merle? - You don't listen to anyone anyway, so what do you care? - Oh I like you. I like you. - Then we're good to go. We're good to go! - Whoo! - Hey El. - Hey. - Hi Rocko. Thank you for this. - You're welcome. This isn't modified, Ellie. A late model your wheelbase is wider so it'll handle better but you got 300 more horsepower under the hood. You're gonna be carrying a lot of speed. - I think I got it, Mom. - Ellie, speed can be dangerous. - I understand. - Oh, well, you're lucky 'cause this series allows spotters.

What is this? - Take a look yourself. (thoughtful music) - This is Dad's stuff? - Yeah. - Wow. Oh my god. This is incredible. You just held onto all of this? - Yeah. I don't know when the last time I looked at is, but I didn't get rid of it. - Maybe you should've gotten rid of this one. (both laughing) Wow. I wish I knew him. - You do. He's in you. Every time I look at you it's his face looking back. Okay, I'm not proud of this. - What is this? - Tim tried to stay in touch with you. But I wouldn't let him. - Mom. - Yeah. It was a mistake. Think I thought I was protecting you, but I was just protecting myself. - Just look at all of these. - One for every birthday. - Except when I turned seven. - What? I saw that one sitting on top of the mail. I took it up to my room and never told you about it. - Can you ever forgive me? - Yeah. Yeah, of course. (gentle music) - Gees, it's just mail. (both chuckling) (upbeat music) - Merle? - Yeah, yeah I got ya. - Copy me? - [Merle] Loud and clear. - There ya go. - Lady driver wants to run with the big boys now, huh? - You're not scared, are you Buck? - A little scared you're gonna crash into me. I've seen what you can do out there. - Well, can't crash into you if I'm ahead of you. - You dream that dream. Maybe after the race you can come by the winner's circle and we can go out and celebrate my victory. - Sorry, I have other plans. - Oh yeah? Better than hanging out with me? - Oh yeah. (Buck laughs) - Right. You call me when you're done with Earl. - It's Merle. Nice work Merle. - I didn't really do anything. - I know. - So who was that? - That was Buck McCreadie. - Get out. - You know him? - Oh I know that last name. And I know you're gonna need to beat the snot outta him tonight. - Can do, boss. - Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the main event tonight, here at the spectacular Lucas Oil Speedway. (cheering) We've got 100 laps for $100,000 in the Protect the Harvest Nationals. Locked into that front row are your top qualifiers, Bob Paxton and Jimmy Crunden. They'll lead this 32 car field to the green flag. - [Ellie] Can you hear me? - Loud and clear. Good luck out there, kid. - [Announcer] In the second row, in the 1 car, is the talk of the track this week: up and comer Buck McCreadie out of Petaluma, California. He's one of the youngest racers out here tonight. But his lap times this season have been fantastic. (fireworks popping) Car advance coming out of turn four, a salute to America, the greatest country on Earth. And to you, the greatest fans in automobile racing. - All right Buck, stay focused out there. - [Buck] Always focused. - This is gonna bring us to the green flag for our main event. - You got this, kid. (engines revving) (upbeat music) - [Announcer] Box Paxton, Jimmy Crunden at the line. Here we go. - [Jessie] You can do it, Ellie. Just drive the car. - Only five laps in and Buck McCreadie already finds himself in second place, chasing down the leader. (tense music) Buck McCreadie's not the only driver from Petaluma, California. In the middle of the pack in the 32 car is Ellie Lansing, a young lady who's only 16 years old. (tense music) Buck McCreadie takes over the lead. - Oh this is your race to lose tonight. - [Buck] You know it. - All right El, track's getting slick. - I'm gonna try and squeeze on the inside. - Nothing Ellie Lansing does here tonight seems to be doing any good. (metal clanking) (metal clanking) Oh, Mason Syler and Jimmy Briggs collide, hanging into turn three. Looks like everyone's okay but a caution flag has come out. It's certainly an endurance test out here tonight, folks. Staying clean and green for 100 laps is no easy feat. - I think I'm in over my head. - All right listen, if you take away the fancy stadium and fireworks, you know what's left? - No, what? - A dirt track. Same size as the one back home. Show me what ya got. - You're right. Thanks, Mom. - With that green flag, we're back to racing, ladies and gentlemen. 37 in the books, 63 to go and Buck McCreadie will not let go of that lead. - Hold your line, Buck. - [Buck] Now don't worry, I got this. - [Announcer] McCreadie with an impressive lap time. He's actually starting to lap some of the competition. The 32 car, Lansing, with a clean pass on car 5. - Yes! Damn! Found another gear, kid. - Just another dirt track, Mom. - [Announcer] McCreadie still out in front. But the real story out here tonight is the rookie Lansing in car 32, who started in 14th but is now all the way up to 6th. Make that 5th! (laughing) - All right, 20 laps to go. - [Ellie] 20 laps, copy. - [Buck's Spotter] Stay sharp, Buck, this race is yours. - [Buck] I ain't worried. (engines revving) - [Announcer] Lansing in 32 makes another pass on car 20, moving up to 4th place. - [Jessie] Double zero on your tail. - What's he doing? (metal clanking) - Ooh, the double zero, he threw a fender. - [Ellie] Hey! - [Announcer] The 32 car almost into the wall. But Lansing pulls out of it. - I'm good. - [Announcer] This young lady sure can drive. - Payback time. - [Announcer] Lansing looking for revenge, dive under double zero to move back into 4th. - She's pretty good, huh? - She's the best. - [Announcer] Lap 87, McCreadie still unchallenged. We're closing on the final 10. Can McCreadie shut the door on the rest of the pack? - [Jessie] Are you comfortable with 4th place young lady? - Not tonight. My sponsor's in the stands. - Whoo! - [Announcer] Lansing with a powerful move on the outside. She might claim a podium spot here tonight. - (laughs) Yes! (crunching) - Oh, that did not look pretty. He just came in too hot and spun him. - Six laps to checker, Ellie. - [Ellie] Roger that. - Buck McCreadie's gotta be feeling the heat from the hard charging Ellie Lansing, who's now right on his back bumper. - [Jessie] You like following that McCreadie boy? - No. And I think he's led this race long enough. (laughing) - There you go kid. (gentle music) - After a hard night of racing, it's all come down to these final six laps. - Bring her home. - Hey El. - God? Is that you? - It's your Uncle Tim here. Coming to you in a dream. - Oh I see. You got a secret for me. - [Tim] Yeah, drive faster than Buck. - (laughs) I miss you. - I miss you too. - [Announcer] And the race is back under way. - All right El, let's do this. Now, now, commit El. - [Announcer] 32 and 39 side by side to, oh there's some contact. And Lansing comes out of it in second place, right behind Buck McCreadie. - Watch your six, Buck. - Come on, Ellie. - [Announcer] Lansing just can't find a way to make a run on McCreadie. - I'm gonna set him up to dive in late. - Right on the bumper. - Buck! She's right behind you. - The white flag's out, folks. Just one lap to go. - Here I come. - [Tim] Inside, inside. - Come on Buck, do not let that girl pass you. What are you doing? - [Announcer] Oh, McCreadie gets loose on the outside. It's a clear shot. - [Buck] No, no, no, no, no. - No, no! - Clear El, clear. - Come on! - [Announcer] And the winner is the newcomer, taking the checkered flag. Congratulations on your first Protect the Harvest Nationals win. (fireworks popping) (happy music) (cheering) - [Vance] Ellie! Yeah! - [Loretta] I'm gonna make you the biggest cake you've ever seen. - [Merle] Good job, Ellie. - One, two, three. Cheese.
