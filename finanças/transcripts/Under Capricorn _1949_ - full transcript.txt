In 1770 Captain Cook discovered Australia. 60 years later, the city of Sydney, capital of New South Wales, had grown on the edge of 3 million square miles of unknown land. The colony exported raw materials. It imported material even more raw. Prisoners. Many of them unjustly convicted. Who were to be shaped into pioneers of a great dominion. In 1831 King William had sent a new Governor, to rule the colony. And now our story begins. Present arms! As the accredited representative of his gracious majesty, King William. To express to you, his Majesty's loyal, and beloved subjects. His Majesty's warm interest in the progress and welfare of your community. Gentlemen. I know very little of your country, you know very little of me. Some of you have no very good record of us. Have I the honor of addressing the honorable Charles Adare? - Yes, who are you? - Potters my name, Sir. Cedric Potter. I am the manager of the Bank New South Wales. We knew you were arriving in the governor's entourage. We should be glad to do anything we can for you, Sir. Anything we can. This is an odd place to do business. This Sir? Not at all, Sir. You'll find it's unconventional perhaps, but we get things done very rapidly. I'm sure you do. I've had clients working a chain gang in January and drinking champagne by July. Extraordinary changes of fortune you'll see here, Sir. No doubt. You must give me time to settle down before we talk business. I'll call you tomorrow. - You are staying at the government house? - Yes. - Your second cousin is the Governor? - Yes. An interesting relationship. - When may I look forward to seeing you? - Tomorrow at 11? Admirable, Sir, admirable. Well look, he's just finishing. I must join him. Gentlemen, I have no more to say. Except that I am greatly obliged to you, for your welcome. What about a song, Governor! Viva the governor! - Not a very warm welcome. - The climate's making up for that. Wellington used to say he didn't give a rap for the cheers he got before the battle. They don't know what they're in for yet. This way, sir. Ah, you have done some business experience - Absolutely none. I am a youngest son you see, and the youngest son of an Irish parent to a very bad bargain. I ought to be able to write and shoot I suppose, but I am rather short sighted and I hate horses. - Unfortunate, isn't it? - Very. Come in. Mr. Flusky to see you, Mr. Potter. Ask him if he wouldn't mind waiting a few minutes. Tell him I'm engaged with the governor's cousin. Flusky, Flusky. That's a curious name. Seems to ring a bell somewhere. Flusky, Rusky, Dustky. Who is he? One of our most admirable citizens. A large land owner. He has made some most profitable investments. Rather a financial genius in his way. He owns the best stock in the colony and he works like a galley slave. That is to say he works very hard. Flusky, Flusky. Where the devil have I heard that name before? Well so you can't tell me how to get rich? Well really only by hard work, Mr. Adare. Well I must ask somebody else. I must ask your friend Mr. Flusky. How'd he start? Well, Sir. It's rather a long story. And to tell you the truth, in this country we don't talk too much about the past history of our successful men. Oh, an ex-convict. An emancipist is his? Well yes, Sir. An emancipist. Well what did he serve his time for? Bank robbery or is he just a murderer? Stop Mr. Adare, stop. We do not discuss these matters in Sydney. A man's past is his own business. Out here, we let bygones be bygones. You do that? It's a thing we are never allowed to do in Ireland. I'm always bumping into bygones. How about you introduce me to him? - Sir, if you wish it. But... - Be careful what I say. Mr. Flusky! Sir! Mr. Flusky, sir. Would you be good enough to step this way? Mr. Flusky, let me present to you the honorable Charles Adare. He's a cousin of his excellency the Governor. - He's come to Sydney to make his fortune. - Has he? Please to meet you. I hope you told him, you can't find fortunes like fleas in a blanket. Yes, I told him that, Mr. Flusky. I'm not sure I've ever seen a flea. Are they difficult to pick up? It depends on how quick you are. Now that I come to think of it. Fleas have a great reputation for agility in my part of the country. - What country may that be? - Ireland, the west of Ireland. Ireland. - What did you say your name was? - Adare. Do you know the west country? I might. So you want to make money? You're not the only one. How much have you got to start with? Not enough to impress Mr. Potter. Are you one of the Adares of Killala? Yes. Lord Killala is my father. Do you know him? Well Mr. Adare, perhaps you can give me a little time to think over how I can best advise you? If you'll drop in tomorrow... I'm going your way. If you come with me, I might be able to tell you a thing or two. I shan't be a minute. I have something to get from the cashier. See you another time, Mr. Potter. Mr. Adare, sir. He's a strange character, Mr. Adare. A strange character. He seems to have taken a fancy to you. I hope you won't mind if I give you one word of advice. If he asks you to his house, don't go. Why not? A gentleman in your position can't be too careful. Ready now, Mr. Adare. Would you like me to tell you what he said? I don't quite follow. "If Old Flusky asks you to his house, don't go." That's it isn't it? I wasn't paying much attention, I'm afraid. Pay attention to me. Bring the horse. You want to make some money. There is a bit of land for sale going for a thousand pounds. I want you to buy. I myself want to buy a great many things Mr. Flusky. Unfortunately I have no money. Potter you will make you a short-term loan. I will buy the land straight away from you. For a good deal more than you paid for it. If I hear right, Mr. Klusky, you're willing to give me a considerable sum of money. - It's worth my while. - Why? Simple enough. I've bought all the land from the crown that law allows. - There is nothing against a private deal. - Sounds delightful. Forgive me. I'm still a little puzzled. Why are you offering me this admirable investment? I might have my reasons. I might not. This is the found lands office. I have a bit of business in here. Come in if you like and file your application. Saves time. Her you are. Just on the minute as usual. I've got some grazing for your new sheep. Never mind that now. - I want my secretary. - I've got one for you. And he can read and write. Says he is a gentleman. How long is he in for? Five-years. Let's have a look at him. Winter! Open your mouth. Arms like chicken legs. - Can you keep accounts? - Yes, sir. - Is that what you're in for? - I don't quite understand you, Sir. Silly in the head are you? - Was it embezzlement? - No, Sir. - He got a girl into trouble. - It wasn't quite like that, you see... Her father would never allow her to marry me. Enough! You'll get nobody into trouble around my place. - What is your name again? - Winter, Sir. If you take me on, I'll do my best. I promise you that, Sir. It's on my word of honor. Words of honor from young gentlemen are not very good currency around here. If you don't do your best, you go back to jail. - He'll do. - You're in luck today. If you treat Mr. Flusky right, he'll treat you right. But if you don't... - See that? - Yes. It's a pink slip. If we put your name on that, you're a convict again. Understand? Send him around to my house. Those laboring men you sent me won't do. One was a horse thief, and the other a murderer. I'd sooner trust a tiger snake than a horse thief, and I won't have murderers in my house. I filled out the pink slips. Send a guard to collect them. Well, if you say so. - You don't like horse thieves? - No, I don't. - Nor murderers? - No. Here's your application. There, there Learly, the old girl ready? - What do you think of her? - Much of a temper? She's got the temper of the Devil himself. Yeh? Mr. Flusky! Is that a human head? Shrunken one. There's a trade in that sort of thing here. Forbidden by law. Got you for that son of an old shark you, you murderer you? Mr. Flusky... Come around to my place tomorrow would you? Any driver will tell you where it is. We dine at 6:30. Well that's very kind of you, but I think perhaps we are being a little hasty. What's that? Well I don't really think I could dream of troubling you. Why not? Well you see I haven't had time to get acquainted. I mean... If it's money you need. Here's a hundred. Take up the option with that. We'll talk about the main deal tomorrow. - Mr. Adare, Sir? - Yes. His excellence sends you his compliments, He would be glad to have a word with you. In his private apartment. It will be a pleasure. - Where's his excellency? - Right over there, Sir. - Who is it? - Charles. Come in, come in, my dear fellow. Make yourself comfortable. Help yourself to a drink. Thank you. Where was I, Banks? - You'll excuse me, Charlie won't you? - Yes, of course, yes. His Excellency accordingly feels bound to draw his worship's attention to.. Attention to what? You didn't say. Oh yes, tell him the approach to the docks is the filthiest sight I've ever seen. Tell him I don't like old barrels and cart wheels and cabbage leaves and dead cats. Tell him to move quickly, or I'll have the skin off his back. His Worships attention to the fact that the sanitary conditions of the harbor, leaves much to be desired. Yes, that's the kind of thing. Write it down. No, not out loud. I want to talk to Mr. Adare. No, no don't go. Had a busy day? Yes, thank you. Quite busy. Been to the bank? Yes. What do they think of your prospects? Not much. Now look here, Charles. I hope you're going to try harder this time. Where is that soap? I have got it, I've got it. I had a chat with one of the local magnates. That's good. Get to know the natives. Who was it? A man named Flusky. Do you know him, Banks? Well, yes Sir, yes, I know him. - Something wrong with him? - No, Sir. He's a very honest man in his way. He's had a brush or two with Mr. Corrigan of course. Who is Mr. Corrigan. The attorney general, Sir, you remember? Yes, of course. But everybody has trouble with him. That's nothing against Mr. Flusky. Does he receive a government house? Socially, I mean. Oh no, Sir. Emphatically not. Mr. Potter, the manager of the bank says he's an emancipist. - You mean he's a convict? - Oh no, no. Now look here, Charles. After all, I mean to say... you are my cousin. I hope nobody saw you speaking to him? I'm dining with him tomorrow. What does this Flusky do? Oh he's very amiable really. He talked about Crown land mainly. You know perfectly well what I mean. What was his crime? I haven't the slightest idea. They told me it's in shocking bad manners to ask questions out here. Banks! With very due respect, may I venture to remark that Mr. Adare is quite right. It is the custom here after a man have served his term as a guest of his Majesty, never to inquire into his antecedents. That is unless he wants himself once again within the reach of the law. Flusky. Flusky. Odd name. I've heard it before somewhere. I thought that too. Well, never mind. In actual fact, I believe he is quite a rich man. Flusky, something to do with some woman or other. Well he can't be the same man. Throw me one of those towels, Banks. That's right. Thank you. Now come with me. I want you to take some notes as I'm dressing. I'll see you at dinner, Charles. Get out of that dinner tomorrow, Charles. You can't be too careful. It might be awkward for me. It won't do you any good. No good at all. That's an order, Charles. I expect they'll find you something to eat in the kitchen. No, Sir. If it's all the same to you, I'd rather go back to Sydney. - All that way? - Yes, Sir. If you don't mind. To tell you the honest truth, Sir, I don't like this place. Oh, Why not? Looks like a very handsome establishment. There's nothing much the matter with it's looks. There is something queer about that place. You see what I mean? No, I'm afraid I don't. Must I ignore it, Well Sir, I can only say I don't like it. Not to hang about it for any length of time. - What time should I come back for you? - Oh, call for me at 10. Minyago Yugilla. - What does that mean? - Why weepest though. It's your business to see that the ladies get a swell dinner. Give them something to talk about. - The ladies? - Of course there will be ladies. Haven't I just told you? Winter, you've had dinner with the knobs in your day, you sure everything's alright? Oh yes, Mr. Flusky. I've arranged for some rather good wine. I've decant... You take care of that. I know nothing about it. Would you like me to ask Madame... You'll ask me, Mr. Winter. Never mind about Madame. I run this house. Settle it between yourselves. Now, what's the matter? This little slapper, said I was put away for kidnapping. So you were. Stop sniveling and tidy yourself. Look out for the front door and serve the Madeira. Give them their pink slips. Send the lot back to the crown office and get a new bunch. I can mange them. Oh, Good evening. I hope I'm not disturbing you. I was trying to find my way in. Good evening Mr. Flusky, your front doorbell wouldn't ring, so I had to come around this way. A very strange thing. Glad to see you. Go through the dining room if you don't mind. - Good looking currie. - Quite a party you're having tonight, Mr. Flusky. - Winter. - Yes, sir? Mrs. Flusky, should know better. Good evening, Mr. Rigg. Good evening, Mr. Smiley. Good evening. May I introduce the Reverend Mr. Smiley. And Mr. Rigg. Our resident engineer. Mrs. Smiley bid me tell you, how distressed she was to be unable to accept your kind invitation. She isn't very well you know, and Mrs. Rigg generously offered to sit with her for the evening.. That's right. My wife is most disappointed. I think you know Mr. Flusky, that Mrs. Rigg is very partial to a life of gaiety. Follow me gentlemen. I trust your wife's indisposition isn't serious. Oh no. Indeed, no, Sir. Mrs. Smiley's not very strong. But she has remarkable powers of recuperation. I find it difficult to express, Mr. Flusky the deep appreciation which the church feels at the gift of the baptismal fountain. Be perfectly assured the Lord will bless the giver. - How do you like Sydney, Mr. Adare? - Oh I like it very much. I admire in particular, the bandicoot, the Rock wallaby and the duck-billed platypus. Don't take this preference as implying any dedication of the, spiny Ant-eater, the Cockatoo or even the Frilled Lizard. There's always the Kangaroo, Mr. Riggs, always the Kangaroo. I didn't mean that exactly. I meant the society. - Is there any? - Well, maybe not much. Nice town, but not much society in it. I never think of these things, but it's hard on the wife. - Is the Governor going to entertain much? - I haven't a notion. I'll hope you'll bear the name Rigg in mind? Rigg's the name. Mrs. Rigg. She's a lady, you know? Oh, I'm sure she is. A refined woman finds time weighing heavy on her hands in a place like this. I'd like you to meet her. And I should be enraptured to meet, Mrs. Rigg. Refinement counts for a lot, but it's a handicap in a way. Yes, It must be, debilitating. Ah, my dear, Sir. How are you? Mrs. Wilkins sends her sincerest compliments, she is quite heart broken. A terrible disappointment. She is absolutely frustrated with one of her headaches. I must say it's on my conscious, that I had to leave her, but I absolutely must meet your distinguished guest. There seems to be a grave epidemic among the ladies of this city. Well Sir, It's difficult you see. Mr. Adare, This is Major Wilkins. He's the commandant of the prison. I'm most happy to meet you. How does the Governor find himself after his voyage from England? In excellent health, thanks. That's good, that's good. He won't remember me, but I was assistant Provo Marshall when he was was on Wellington staff. I do hope he is going to inspect the prison soon. It's a disgrace to the colony. I wouldn't keep a pig in my quarters. - Are you a connoisseur of pigs? - No, I don't want to keep pigs. I leave that to the Irish. I beg your pardon, Sir. You're an Irishman yourself, aren't you? Yes. - And so is the Governor, isn't he? - Yes. A great race. Fine body of men. Great gentlemen, brave soldiers. I do hope you will drop a word to Sir Richard about the prison. It really is a scandal. My cousin is most interested in scandals. I'm sure you'll find him sympathetic. Flusky, I'm terribly distressed. But unfortunately my wife was detained at the last moment. Mr. Adare, I presume. I am Dr. Macallister. How do you do? I'm late I'm afraid. Sorry my wife couldn't come. Detained at the last moment. I understand perfectly. Mr. Corrigan, the Attorney General. Mr. Adare. - Honored. - How do you do? I had the honor to meet your father once, when I was on circuit. He wouldn't remember me. - Miss Billing! - Was I right? Not a blasted one. - Where is she? - I'll go up and see. - Don't let her come down. - I won't. You'd better start. Dinner's served. Bring your wine in with you. Dinner's ready. We may as well get it over, Mr. Adare. Charming fellow the Governor. Follow me, gentlemen. How is our patient? I hope she is sleeping better. Well enough. My wife sends her apologies. Apologies seem to be in the air tonight. You'll find your place cards. Well we all needn't sit here like a row of milestones. Move down to this end please. - Would you wish my to say grace now, Mr. Flusky? - Huh? Yes, please. Bountiful Jehovah, We thank thee for thy mercers, which we are about to receive. Mercifully grant, that we by them being nourished, may be better enabled to perform our duty and service, to unto thy divine will. Amen. I beg your pardon, Major. Well, I was about... Please be seated, Gentlemen. I hope I'm not too late, to take a glass of wine with you. My wife, gentlemen. Lady Henrietta Flusky. Sit down. Please, sit down. - I'm sorry, but I didn't hear your name. - Adare. Please forgive me, I... so stupid. But don't I to know you? I don't think so Lady Henrietta, I was only a boy when you met last. Where did I meet you? Adare. Then you must be young Charlie. How very strange. Yes, Lady Hattie, I'm Charlie. Yes, I remember you now. You were the only Adare, that was a bad horseman. Your sister Diana brought you over one day, and you lamed my favorite hunter. Sam has never forgiven you. Can I pour you some wine? No, thank you. I married Sam Flusky. But that must have been a long time after. How is your dear sister, Diana? I never write to her, haven't for years. Oh she is very well. She is married. - Did she marry the Frenchman? - Yes. Quite right. Only two people in the world would know about these things. A man and a woman. Nobody knows nothing of Sam or me, except... except, I'm afraid, I'm not very well. Will you give me your arm, Charlie? You'll forgive me gentlemen, won't you? It has been delightful to see you. Sam, don't move. Stay with your guest, I shall be alright. Sam. I must insist. Mr. Adare and I are very old friends. Very old friends. Thank you, Charlie. That was very good of you. Now I have the banister. Good old banister. - Mr. Adare! - Yes! Come please, come quickly. You'd better go. - Have you got your pistol? - Yes. Bring it up here please, quickly. In there, on the end of my bed. Where did you say it was? There on my bed. You can see it quite plainly. It won't worry you anymore. Thank you. I'm so sorry to bother you. I'm very much obliged to you, Charlie. You've been most kind. Good night. You're bothered by rats I see. Yes, pink rats. Every man to his taste. The color is immaterial. There are rats in New South Wales. As I remembered while I was only a youngster at the time of my aunts used to giggle about it at the drawing room at tea time. Which was a cause célèbre. Of what? Oh they gossiped about for a while I am not surprised. - I was only the groom. - Yes, they thought that very amusing I started as a stable boy. I had been with the Constadines for years. I was like one of the family. They're an easy going lot in Ireland. I taught her to ride. It would have done your heart good to see her on a horse. The courage of her. She would go at a fence, like it had the kingdom of heaven on the other side of it. That's the kind of a girl she was. That's the kind of girl she is. But she wasn't at her best tonight. No. I would have no more than thought of making love to her, than if she had been a blessed angel. You know how it is. She had a reckless train in her... I had a bit of the devil in me too. There was bound to be trouble, and trouble there was alright. - I'm wearying you. - No, please go on. Her people were determined to get me, and get me they did. We needn't go into how they did it. I was lucky to escape the gallows. But I got 7 years transportation. You'd think that would have finished it, but it didn't. She sold all she had, and followed me out here. - What did she do then? - She waited. I kept my eyes open while I was in there. I didn't take long in making money. I meant to make it up to her, you see for... all she had been through. But it didn't work out that way. We weren't the same people, the two of us after all of those years. There was nothing to talk about, that we wanted to talk about. What is it they say in the Bible? A great gulf fixed. It was that way somehow. I had my work of course, but... she had nothing. You see... she missed her own thought. That was the trouble. We never mentioned it. A fella can't help thinking... Not that it matters now. I just wish I knew what to do. Why don't you send her home, for a while. Back in Ireland. You know why I asked you here tonight? No. I'd very much like to know. I thought the local ladies would tumble all over each other to meet the Governor's cousin. Perhaps it's just as well, they didn't come. I thought, she might pull herself together. If she could meet some imitations of her own sort. I can get all the gentlemen I want. Gentlemen. I can buy gentlemen in packets of a dozen. I suppose that's why you gave me a hundred pounds. Oh, no no, Sir. That's different. I know a proper gentlemen when I see one. I'm afraid you didn't get your money's worth tonight. No no, that's different I tell you. It wasn't your fault the women didn't come. You treated Hattie right, I... I appreciate that. No Sir, the deal still stands. I don't feel very certain about that deal. Are you sure it's quite legal? Of course it is. There is nothing to prevent you from selling your own land once it's yours. It's in the letter of the law. How about the spirit? It's got nothing to do with me. Milly? Milly? Let Milly go. Good girl, Milly. I don't know what we'd have done without her. She's got a way with Hattie. We've gotta do something about it. We? Oh, I know it's none of my business, but she used to be a friend of my sisters. She did seem to take to you. I think she might listen to me. I think she would. Maybe there's some hope after all. I may drive over and see her now and again. I could get her interested in riding again, maybe. And clothes. Women like new clothes. We could drive into Sydney. If you could get her talking about old times, it might help. You never know. Yes, Sir. I think she took a fancy to you. Well, ah. You must remember we come from the same part of the country. Milly. Why are you so slow? Days ago I gave you definite orders.. I told you not to go to this man's house. Now I hear you disobeyed me. You took part in an unsavory debauch with the scum of the convict colony. Mr. Corrigan was there too. Where Mr. Corrigan goes is his own business. I have no doubt he has business here today. What do you mean? I mean, I resent his being here. You do, do you? Yes, very much. Mr. Corrigan is my legal adviser. He's come to help me with a devilish tricky problem. And of your making, Sir. Is this your signature? Yes, Richard, that is my signature. Don't Richard me, say Sir, when you speak to me. - Alright, Sir. Don't get excited. - Excited? Do you know that you have taken a bit of government land and you haven't got a brass farthing to pay for it? I'm only too well aware of the fact, Sir. In the name of all the suffering Saints... Assuming for one moment that you get possession of this land, will you be good enough to inform me of what you intend to do with it? I was thinking of trying my hand at sheep farming. Sheep farming. Black sheep farming. Are you aware that this lot is in the center of the city? Oh, that seems a rather interesting point. Isn't it? And do you propose to pasture your sheep on the pavement? That would be rather awkward wouldn't it. Well it's kind of obvious to me, that you have got yourself mixed up with some very shady people. Corrigan tells me your Mr. Flusky keeps on the right side of the law. He's wise to do that. Now look here, Charles. You are my Aunt Clara's boy. And I'm quite prepared to overlook a little foolishness for her sake. But I will not have government house turned into a clearing house for tricky finance. If you let me tear up this application, I'll let bygones, be bygones. If not, I wash my hands of you, and you can get out of here. If I weren't your Aunt Clara's boy, you'd have to authorize the sale of this land. I suppose so. Alright, initial it, or whatever you have to do, and I'll get out of here. Where do you propose to live? I don't know, but I'm sure Mr. Flusky would accommodate me at Minyago Yugilla. Where? Minyago Yugilla. It's a luxurious, well appointed mansion. The name means, "Why weepest though". Or why make a definite fuss about nothing. Yes, that's Flusky's house, Sir. Yes, I know, I know. Mr. Corrigan has given me some information about your Mr. Flusky. He's the blaggard that eloped with Hattie Constadine. He was their stable boy or something. And there's worse to come. It was hushed up at the time. But he murdered her brother Dermot in cold blood. If he had justice, he would have been hanged like a dog. As it was the jury brought in culpable homicide... and he was transported for 7 years. Well, there is your friend. He's still got the reputation of being a violent brute. That's right, Corrigan? That's right, your Excellency. Charles. You don't know this place. You must think, and think again. You must think of my position. There is nothing the matter with your position. And I've done all the thinking I'm going to do. Good morning. Charles, It's good to have you here. And get a breath of the old country. I'm grateful to you for that, and many other things. Ooh, I'm grateful too. It's pleasant to be gathering shamrock's at the other end of the world. I said many other things. You were very good to me on the night of that dreadful dinner party. I remember very little of it. I wasn't well. I know. You were extremely drunk. No one has ever said that to me before. That is a great pity. Yes. But there was no one. Didn't Sam tell you? I don't think you understand about Sam and me. So many things have happened to us. So many things we dare not talk about. My weakness became part of it. You need help, don't you? It's all too late. Those seven years. I once thought that after all the suffering we could be happy. It wasn't so. When Sam came out, we lost each other. I'm no good now, Charles. No good at all. You mustn't talk like that. I had hoped so hard. With everything burned out of me, I... lived on my will and my... my will is exhausted. Oh, you mustn't even think like that. Did I make a terrible exhibition of myself at the party? When was it? I don't even remember dressing. It's like one of those silly dreams. Was I dressed? Yes. More or less. That's the fist time I've seen you smile. - You're very kind. - No, it's you who are kind. You took me in like a stray dog, and I must earn my board and lodging and I'm determined to do that. We Irish, must make a better impression on the colony. We? Well you. I don't matter. You have a very extraordinary effect upon me Lady Hattie. I spent most of my life warding off boredom, look at me now. I'm boiling with enthusiasm. We must do a great many things. We'll sail in the bay, and you must ride. Sam says you are a superb horsewoman and I believe him. You must look lovely on a horse. It is no use, I tell you. I can't. You must learn to run your own house. Let me see. What do ladies do? You must order the dinner. Oh Milly does all of that. You should be punctual and beautifully dressed. You'll spend your mornings looking through the linen or, whatever one looks through in the morning. Oh Charles, Milly looks after all that. I told you, I'm finished. I tried before. For Sam's sake, but it's no use. Oh look at me. Don't you think I can see myself through and through. Can you? Of course I can. Do you ever look into a mirror? I have no mirror. I put them away years ago. What do you see? If you saw what I see... you saw a very beautiful woman. What are you going to do with her? I'll buy you a new mirror. It'll be your conscience. You'll look into it every day and say to yourself, Sister Hattie, Sister Hattie, Do you see anyone coming? And the mirror will answer. Yes by George, it's yourself. Riding to beat back the shadows and be queen again in your own kingdom. Brrr. I felt as if somebody had walked over my grave. It's only Milly. I don't think she likes me very much. Oh, she's a wonderful woman. She's devoted to Sam. She's very kind to me. She's no ordinary decent looking woman, but she can give me a look that would scare the dashes off the devil himself. What's funny? Oh, I don't know. Something that made us laugh. So you got her back on this? Who is that? What do you mean? Is that the reflection of Amy Henrietta Constandine or is it not? It looks like her. I'm proud of you, my dear. Charles. Why not? It's a respectable tribute to your reincarnation. It wasn't very respectful. Well it was intended to be. Why should you respect me? Because you're a great lady again, and you promised to be the mistress in your own house. First work of art that I have ever done. It's wonderfully beautiful. I've tried Charles, haven't I? Yes, we haven't finished yet. We've only just begun. Let me see what's next. Where are the keys? Milly has them. Milly? What does Milly think she is? The keys belong to the mistress of the house. You must wear them, because they will clink and give you confidence. Let me see. What's the first battle? I know, the kitchen. Milly would be furious if I went in the kitchen. Well, make her furious. You must give the orders, you must give all the orders. Remember that. I've an idea. Let's put it to a tune. Who gives the orders in Flusky's house, Flusky's house, Flusky's house. Oh Charles, what would I do without you? Well, you must do without me now. Now off you go, into the kitchen. Come with me. You're a gentleman, aren't you? Yes, I suppose so. A gentleman that can keep his mouth shut. That's why I didn't have one of the women. Less than usual. She's got something new to wash it down now. What is the matter with these people? They began cackling like parakeets, then they suddenly fell silent. They're an ignorant lot. I'll take care of them. No, no, after this I want you to consult me about everything. Everything. I have left too much on your shoulders. I should come here every morning. No, I want you to come to my room. Every morning, to get your instructions for the day. Now I would like to see the linen cupboard. You have the key? So that's the way it is, is it? Yes. Will you kindly give me your keys? It's bound to be difficult going in. But you must go on. It's no good, I tell you. It's no good. You've gotta give up. She's done for. Oh don't talk like that, Sir. Can't you see how hard she has been trying? You've seen more of her, than I have. Oh good heavens, Flusky. You want me to see her, talk to her? Don't make too much of this. She's coming back I tell you. Doesn't look like it tonight. She's bolted the door before, and stayed there weeks on end. But Sam, tonight's different. She's on her way to find herself and we've got to do something. I tell you it's no good. I don't say things for fun. Look, Sam. I'm not quite clear what went wrong in the kitchen today, but I think Miss Milly's to blame. You don't know what Miss Milly has to put up with. I'll thank you to keep your mouth shut about that. None of my business. None of your business. But it's still my business to help Hattie, and I'm going to do it. Do what you like. Hattie. Hattie! Not a sound. I told you so. Not even for you. Well I'm not done yet. Hattie! I'm coming up for you! Hattie Hattie! Hattie. I don't want to see you. I don't want to see you ever again. I couldn't do what you told me. Go back home, and tell them I died. You are talking nonsense. Go back to Ireland. Now leave Hattie Flusky's beautiful place. This beautiful room. I don't think much of it. Come on now. You must get up. Poor job at getting up for now. And me no good to any living soul. While I'm on my head and my heels. That's better, isn't it? No it's not better. Yes it is. Ever so much better. You're standing on your feet. You must always stand on your feet. You must never give way. I am no credit. Yes you are. At least you will be. I've never been serious about anything in my life before, but I'm serious now. You must have courage. I had courage long ago, but I lost it. No, this is all wrong. This is not the way of it at all. I'll do my best, but this is not the way of it. My best isn't much good. Yes it is. You know what happened in the kitchen? I couldn't take control. Milly was right. I'd be the ruination of this house within a week. I wanted to give you a beautiful dinner. How could I? I can't do anything anymore. I can't remember it. Then you must remember. Can you remember the west wind coming off the Atlantic. You'll fill your eyes with the greens and the purples of the place you were born. The horse is still there on the hillside. Can you feel the turf, pounding underneath your horses hooves? Now go to sleep and dream about it. I'll ring the bell for Milly to put you to bed. Tomorrow, We'll ride down to the bay. One sea is much like another that will help to remind you. It's all for the honor of Ireland. Oh, Ireland. Come in. Oh there you are. Will you help Lady Henrietta to bed please? It looks like it's your job. What the devil do you mean? You impertinent... I can't help it, Mr. Flusky. I've got to say what's on my mind. Mr. Flusky, your lady is a big enough handful without interference in my work. I've got nothing against her, poor soul. But she should have kept out of my kitchen. What she does elsewhere is none of my business. There would be no harm in you keeping your eyes open. No harm at all. - I'm sorry, I didn't know you were busy... - No, come on in. I've said my say. I won't have meddling. I won't stand that, not from anybody. What's all this about? Those that put ideas into her head, had better stop it for everybody's sake and those the cat fits, can wear it. Just a moment. I think you oughta hear what I'm going to say, Sam. I'm beginning to understand something about this household. Last night, I... Yes, last night. I could tell you a thing or two about last night. You could tell a very great deal, hadn't you? If either of you has anything to say, say it. Mr. Flusky. I suppose you know what was the matter with your wife last night. She went into her own kitchen to meet with some act of calculated and brutal rudeness. That man was in her room last night and the door locked. The two of them alone with half her clothes off. That's rudeness for you, if you like. What did you say to her in the kitchen? I turned her out. I've told that to Mr. Klusky. He's got a right to question me. You've none. Who do you think you are anyway? I beg your pardon, sir. It's not so much what she said, you see I happened to be there. Oh, he was there alright. In he comes as bold as brass and dumps a load of bottles on the table, and her ladyship knew where they came from alright. You talk to him about rudeness. Mr. Adare, it wasn't like that at all. You're a gentleman, you must understand. Gentleman, blast all gentleman. Get out of here. - You too, Miss Milly. - I'm getting out. I wouldn't stay another hour in this house. If you can put up with such going's on, that's your business. You're well rid of her. We shan't get along too well without her. You'll get along without her like a house on fire. She's a bad log. All that talk was meant to cover her retreat. Was it? Well, of course it was. Surely you don't think. I don't know what to think. May I ask what you mean by that? I've only your word against hers. You may accept mine. Because you're a gentleman? So is Winter a gentleman. All stand together. Against the outsiders, the trash, the scum of the world. Against Sam Flusky for one. A common servant. The old convict. Then there's my wife too. She's a lady. Ladies and gents look at things their own way. Well... maybe Miss Milly and I look at them another. You said I gave you hope. Have you given it up? Not yet. Then listen to me and not to spiteful gavel. But Milly's been here for years. If it's only Milly's gossip that's bothering you, we may as well shake hands. I must have misunderstood you. I'd like it if you did. Goodbye Mr. Flusky. And, I'll pray. I'll pray to the Lord that your eyes may be opened. Goodbye. Well what should I do about breakfast? What about it? Well you see, Miss Milly always looked after those things, and those women in the kitchen. Would you like to ask Lady Henrietta? She never gets up before mid-day. Anyhow, what would she do with that crazy crowd? See to it yourself. Very well, Sir. I'll do what I can. Sam, where has Milly gone? She's left us. Why? How do I know? But she can't. She mustn't. But you must bring her back. You know her. She's made up her mind. Oh but, Sam, this is dreadful. There must be some reason. Good morning. How are you? I'm very well thank you. I've got my mail from government house and there isn't a writ or a tradesman bill. It's a wonderful morning and... what's the matter? Milly is gone. I just said it's a wonderful morning. I'll go further, it's a perfect morning. But I can't do without her. Adare says you can. Indeed you must. I'm very much afraid, Sir, you'll have to speak to them yourself. Who gives the orders in Flusky's house? I'll have the lot of them back to Sydney tonight. Sam? I'll go. Oh Lady Henrietta, should you? Quiet you! So I says to her, you'll calm down, will be your downfall and that's the truth, it is. A woman follows her heart, and she follows the road to ruin. Where does she keep it, I'd like to know. Is it Gin, you're looking for? Oh, she don't keep it. That highborn hussie upstairs, she keeps flushing it down as fast as it comes in the house. And I don't blame her... Did you see what I did just now? Yes. Do you know what it means? After today, nobody will be beaten in this house. You understand that? Yes. Say "Yes, My Lady". Yes, My Lady. If you, If you wish to stay here, you may. But there are three things I don't like. Noise, fighting and stealing. If I find any of these three things, I shall send you back to prison. Is that understood? Yes, my lady. What is your name? Susan, Ma'am. But I answers to Crumpet. Why do they call you Crumpet? Because I'm barmy, Ma'am. Barmy on the Crumpet is the saying here. After this, you'll answer to Susan. Yes, Ma'am. My Lady. Which of you is the cook? Oh, I mostly do most. She's a liar, Mum. Don't you believe her. I'm the cook. - She's nothing but a murderer. - Quiet! Can Aunt Marta, here, cook? Me Ma'am, no can. Very good. You three make the breakfast. I want coffee, toast, eggs and bacon. Three separate breakfasts. Each of you will make one breakfast, and the one who does best will be the cook. Yes, My Lady! Good. No noise and no fighting. And now begin. Charles... By the way, I have a bit of news for you. At the request of his excellency, the Governor. Samson Flusky esquire, and Lady Henrietta Flusky, are invited to the Irish Society ball at government house. On January 24th. I don't like much that kind of joke. It isn't a joke. I picked it up in my mail and government house. I don't understand. Sam and I aren't on any list at government house. You must be. They'll never invite and ex-con to government house. Why worthy cousin has a way of doing as he likes. It runs in the family. You've got to go. But Charles, you heard what my husband said just now. I agree with him. I wish Hattie could go, and show them. We could dance that new dance in France. You know the waltz, Lady Henrietta? So seductive, yet so truly respectable? Oh don't be so stupid. They danced it in Ireland before I left. Then you know how to waltz? I used to. That settles it. No. What did I hear you say, no? No woman of fashion ever says no. And what would the Governor say, with his invitation flung back in his face? You want to show Mrs. Wigg, Mrs. Tigg and Mrs. Rigg, and Mrs. Fig how a real lady behaves. You owe it to the poor wretches. I've got nothing to wear. We'll get you something, won't we, Sam? Then it's all settled. No, no, don't talk about it anymore. My good woman, can't you see you're coming back? You're coming back to the sounds of trumpets and violins. Don't be a coward, Hattie. Very well. You'll come, Sam? No, I'd spoil it. I'm no dancing master. It makes me sweat. Mr. Adare will take you. There won't be a woman there to match you, not by a thousand miles. By gum, I'll be proud of you. It'll be the finish of all that. Here, take these. You keep them for me, Sam. I'll come to you when I need them. Well, I want you to have them. Here. Put them on your waist. Just as Milly did. You can't lose them that way. Nobody can take them from you. I'll get you a wonderful dress. I'll ride into Sydney today. Better take me with you. Or better still, leave it to Hattie and me. Maybe you're right. I'd be better at ordering a set of harness. Let the cobbler stick to his last. Well Hattie, I've just finished writing to my sister. Would you care to add a few words? No, you write something for me. Alright. You dictate, and I'll write. How do you want me to start? As I said in my last letter, 15 years ago. No. Say, Diane, my dearest friend. I hope I may still call you that. Your brother has no doubt has told you something of my story. He can not have told you, what he does not know. How grateful my husband and I feel towards him. And how happy we are that he is our guest. She won't believe a word of that, she knows me too well. Is our guest. I'm very fond of him. And you should be very proud of him. His visit means more to me than I can express. Someday, you must come to New South Wales. And I shall tell you the whole story. Come on Hattie. We mustn't keep the Governor waiting. How do I look, Sam? Alright. Alright? Alexa Kalani is alright. Sunrise over the pyramids, is alright. The Taj Mahal, is alright. Oh come, Sam. You must do better than that. I was wondering if a bit of jewelry would help? Do you think so, Sam? Just an idea. A collar of rubies, maybe. Rubies with that dress, do you want your wife to look like a Christmas tree? I think he's right, Sam. Rubies wouldn't go with this dress. Besides, I haven't any rubies. Oh, It's only a notion I had. You look perfect as you are. Come on, or we'll be late. - Goodbye, Sam. - Hattie, hurry. Very pretty she looked, I must say. They made a handsome couple. I suppose it's in the blood. I've come back for my box. I start tomorrow at Mr. Corrigan's. The attorney general only arranged it today, that's why I'm here so late. Can I stay the night in my old room? A cart is coming for my box, first thing in the morning. Yes. Perhaps. Perhaps I could bring you something hot, the way I used to do. The house has a chilly feel tonight, hasn't it? We mustn't have you catching cold, Mr. Flusky. You don't take enough care of yourself that you don't. Though I'm sure her Ladyship does her best, but perhaps her mind is a bit preoccupied these days. It's a good thing. Poor soul. She looked lovely tonight. Like, as if something new had come into her life. And there she is, going to the Governor's Ball. Will wonders never cease? The whole town talking about her ball dress and how beautiful it was. Mr. Adare he ordered it himself they said. Him, never out of the dressmaker's shop. And they were saying Mr. Adare should be a ladies maiden. It's funny a manly young fellow like that, taking so much trouble with a woman's frills. Not that there's any harm in it. They're gentry you see. They don't have the same rules as us, Mr. Flusky. They take everything for granted. But here, I'm talking on and on. It's the loneliness, I think. It's right that her ladyship should have a bit of pleasure so long as she doesn't lose her head. It's none of my business at all. And you wouldn't have let them go, if there had been any of that sort of thing. You're not the sort to let a young spark play fast and loose with his wife. You're a man. That respects himself, Mr. Flusky. That's why we all respect you. Least wise, nearly all of us. It's wonderful... that her ladyship should be out there. Driving in a carriage through the darkness. And then into the lights and the music, They tell me there' a new kind of dance, very fashionable these days. Men and women dance around in each other's arms until they are giddy. A waltz they call it. They wouldn't have that at the Governor's Ball. No decent woman would let a strange man be hugging her and her half naked and everyone looking on. Oh, Mr. Flusky? I've been worried to death. I hope you haven't been giving too much thought to what I said about Mr. Adare and her Ladyship in her bedroom. I'm sure it wasn't her fault. Well, she wasn't what you'd call responsible at the time. I know she wasn't, because she had half her clothes off and didn't seem to notice. It was their taking so long to open the door that made me suspicious. But I may have been wrong. I pray that I was wrong. I'm extremely sorry sir, but you not on the list. You must be an extremely incompetent fellow. I most certainly will report you to the Governor. I'm very sorry, Sir. You're not on the list. Look, "The honorable Charles Adare and lady". That's not my handwriting. He must have filled in this card himself. May I? Indeed you may. But you'll find me terribly out of practice. I've never seen him before. She looks every inch a Lady. The rumors say that she's Flusky's wife. Who did you say? Flusky's wife. But she can't be. What would she be doing here? Who is that exquisite creature? Who do you mean, Sir? You know quite well who I mean. You can't keep your eyes off her yourself. Oh her, Sir. I don't know, Sir. I'll find out, Sir. May I speak to you a moment, your Excellency? Yes, yes, what is it? A rather awkward situation has arisen, Sir. Would you be good enough to look at this card? Well this is absolutely intolerable. You particularly said that he was not to be invited. Of course I did. Where is the infernal fellow? Evening your Excellency, isn't it a very festive occasion? You seem to find it so. What are you doing here? Nothing yet. I hope to do a little dancing. You are not invited. Wasn't I? Dear, dear Banks, such a shocking oversight on your part. And me an Irishman. Banks had nothing to do with it. I cut out your name from the Irish Society list. Why? You know why. You disobeyed my orders. You're keeping bad company. And from all accounts, you're no better than your company. I should have sent you back to Ireland weeks ago. Richard. All the reverence I owe to your high office. I have the honor to inform you that only an old woman, listens to idle gossip. Whatever I listen to, I'm not going to listen to you. Take yourself out of here instantly. Instantly, do you here? I've only just arrived. If you're not out of this building in 2 minutes, by that clock. Your Excellency, may I present the Lady Henrietta Klusky. Delighted. Hattie Constadine. Well, well. I knew your father. I can't have met you before, or I'd have remembered you. Yes, we have met. But handsome Captains in His Majesty's Guard, pay little attention to small girls. It's hard to believe that you were ever that. How humiliating. I remember you perfectly. You took much more interest in our horses than you did in me. You ride much now a days? No, I'm afraid my riding days are over. Nothing of the sort. We must have a canter together one of these days. Will you do me the honor of having supper with me? I should be delighted, but Mr. Adare. Lady Henrietta, I'm broken hearted. I've just received some extremely urgent instructions, and I have no alternative than to obey them at once. I must take you home. Oh I have my instructions from his Excellency in person. I feel we must go. - Now look here, Charles. - No, Sir. You've indicated that even a minute is of vital importance. - It's not so important. - It's most important to me. The 2 minutes have already gone. I owe it to myself to obey you. I can, well someone else can. Excuse me, Sir. There is no one else in my peculiar position. Lady Henrietta. I must respectfully urge you to bid his Excellency good night. What am I to do? You must do as I ask and take supper with me. Mr. Adare. If you had served in the Army, you would know that, when you receive conflicting orders, you must obey the most recent. I order you to remain. Lady Henrietta, may I have the privilege? Charles is my Aunt Clara's boy, you know. Ah, Major Wilkins. I'm Mrs. Rigg. You remember me? Of course. May I? Thank you. Why, Sam. You've changed your mind. It's alright. He's a friend of mine. Sam, it's worked. You'd be proud of me. Hattie's had tremendous success, she's just gone on to supper with the Governor. Come on, have a drink with me, I'll tell you all about it. Where is she? I told you, in the supper room with the Governor. I wouldn't go in there, Sam. I tell you she's had a triumph. You mustn't spoil it. Spoil it! I see. I'm not good enough to stand beside my wife when she is with the Governor. Don't be ridiculous, Sam. You aren't even dressed for a ball. It would make it awkward. Sam, do be sensible. Take your hands off of me. I don't want anything more from you. I believe by the time I was 12, I had broken every bone in my body. Marvelous. I can't imagine why you don't ride now. Perhaps your husband doesn't' care for horses. Oh he loves horses, he's lived with them all. Sam. What a shock, you came. Sir Richard, May I present my husband. We were talking about horses. I was telling his Excellency. That I was brought up in a stable. I heard you. Sir Richard, bought Brogues Pride. After father's death and the stable was broken up. You remember Brogues Pride, don't you? Yes. Sir Richard, I lamed him, and father thought that he would have to be shot. But Sam put him right. Didn't you, Sam? I did more than that for him. I brushed him, fed him, stabled him. And cleaned out his stall besides. I was only a groom you see. She married beneath her. No doubt. I suppose I shouldn't be here among all you swells. In aid of charity isn't it? Well, my money is as good as the next man's. With the compliments of Mr. Samson Flusky esquire. It'll pay for my wife's supper. I don't suppose the young spark, your cousin, paid his shot? It'll do for him as well. He hasn't got a penny that I didn't give him. That's his mark alright. Not a penny. I don't pretend to know what you think you are about my man. But I assure you I have a pretty good memory for incidents of this sort. They tell me your an emancipist. What induced him to do that? He urged me to go and then to spoil it all. He's jealous. Oh jealous of what? He knows of his inferiority and it fills him with black hatred. He's jealous of your shadow, jealous of your world. The man's mad, you can't stop him, we must go back to Ireland. He suffered terribly. I've done him, many a many wrong. Wrong to love him. Wrong to marry him. With no children. A burden when he was trying to save his soul in this new country. Why should he not hate me? Well that's pity I tell you. It's done, it's finished, you owe him nothing. If you understood, you could not talk about owing a debt. Sam is part of me, and I am part of Sam, forever and ever. And it was long ago and I was very young that I learned that. But it was true, and nothing can change it. We used to ride. For miles and miles. And hours and hours together. Sam, 5 paces behind. Silent and respectful like a good groom. And I shivering with the light because I knew of the love he had for me. My father never bothered with how long we were away. He knew Sam was reliable. And that I would come to no harm. We would sit on the heather. Overlooking Galway Bay. And the ocean beyond. Still. Deep and silent. As his love for me. I know about love, you see, for they had talked of it to me. In their soft and sweet wheedling Irish voices. Oh we never did speak, till once, when we were in Dublin for the horse show. Sam was holding my horse outside a shop on Grafton street. As he held the stirrup for me to mount, he suddenly said in his gruff voice, "this is killing me". And I said, "Oh dear, Sam," then I'll save you". That night, I took all the jewels I had brought for the viceroy's ball, and we rode all night. Through the cloudy smell of rain to Drogheda, and found a man with a fishing boat to take us across the channel to Scotland. There we found a horse dealer who sold us two beasts, Who took us the long rough ride to Gretna Green. And the Blacksmith, made us man and wife. And oh, but I was weary, We had our wedding breakfast in the little inn. I was looking across the table at Sam. He was tired too. But he was a tidy man. Who always like to be busy, and he was cleaning and reloading, the big horse pistol we had brought with us. Laughing. Singing a funny little tune to himself. Then my brother, Dermot came in. He was a hard rider with stone, that was the only good thing about him. He had a pistol in his hand, and there was murder in his eyes, and he said to me, "Are you married then?" and I said "Yes". And then he said, "By heaven then, you shan't enjoy it". And he leveled his pistol at me. But Sam jumped across, covering me with his body. And I reached across for the horse pistol and shot Dermot, dead. Under Sam's arm. He had a surprised look in his eyes. When he crumbled up. His pistol went off as he fell. They found the bullet later in the window frame. And that saved Sam's neck. For he took the blame. I didn't know at first that he would take it upon himself. I was ill, so ill. I knew nothing. My family kept everybody away from me. They wanted to avoid a scandal you see. I was delirious for weeks and then, then I had heard what he had done for me. He was in chains. In a convict ship. Half a world away from me. He wrote to me. "If you honor what has been between you and me," not a word. You must do this for me my dear darling... I couldn't speak after that. You understand that don't you? I had to obey him. But I did the only thing I could. I followed him out her and spoke to him sometimes through the bars. How did you live, all those years? What does that matter now? I thought it would comfort him to know that I was there. Charles, I had hoped, to have a home for him, when he came out. To make up for all he had suffered. I thought that we could start life a fresh in this new country. But so many hideous things, became part of him. That horrible little hut, down by the docks. Those sweating walls, and the wooden bugs, and the smells. The drunken screaming women. The children, raking the gutters for food. All that hot misery. It became me. Sam tried to make up for it, when his time had finished. It was no good, Charles. No good at all. Because it is part of me. Even now, I sometimes long to it. Down, down, down, to where I can go no further down. Where nothing can hurt me anymore. No man alive is worth that sacrifice. Do you think he understands what you have done? Oh my darling, you still have some life to live. Come away, come away from all of this. When Sam, blundered into that room this evening. He canceled everything you owed to him. No Charles, you don't know. Oh, you don't know. You couldn't do this sort of thing at government house, Sir. You get more privacy here. Get out! But Sam, Sam, you are making a dreadful mistake. - Did you hear what I said? - Yes, you great lout, I heard. Have you heard what I've been saying to her? You're not worth the sacrifice she's made. She owes you nothing at all. Charles, please. Lets talk about it tomorrow. He'll not stay here another night. You think I'll leave her alone with you? Get out of this house. Please, Sam! Get out! Remember this, you blundering fool, I'll be back tomorrow and if you, Oh Sam, how can he get back to Sydney? Let him walk. I don't care how he gets back. Oh he's' taking your mare. She's savage. Oh stop him, Sam, stop him. He's no horseman, he'll be killed. Well, let him. I don't understand what has happened to you tonight. You've never been like this before. You behave like a madman at the ball. And you are behaving like a madman now. What is the matter with you? You know what's the matter with me. Your fancy man knows too. Do you think you can do this to me? You... trash! You'd better see to your mare, she came out of the gate. I couldn't get close to her. She's thrashing about, she can't stand. She's broken her leg I think. That's all it wanted, by thunder. I don't know, I don't care. She almost broke my neck. He's going to shoot her. Oh you don't know what it means to him. You gentleman. You bloody murdering gentleman. You haven't gone yet, did you lose your new job? First things come first, Mr. Flusky. You'll need someone by you now you've all this trouble. It's terrible you suffering from the interference of others. I mean Mr. Adare of course. I told you about him. You can count on me, Mr. Flusky. Where is she? Lady Henrietta hasn't seen Mr. Adare yet. She says she'll wait until she does. Is Miss Milly going to stay after all? Can't I see Mr. Adare? I've waited for hours. We've had strict orders not to admit you, Lady Henrietta. I knew something like this would happen, I knew it. What possessed me to bring this irresponsible idiot with me, I don't know. Charles. I'm sorry. I have my duty to do. The attorney general is here. We want your statement about Flusky's assault on you. Now look her, Sir. You must not make him talk. His life is in danger. Don't you understand? You needn't think that you are protecting this woman. If you die, you'll have no say in the matter. I won't have very much will I? Charles. This is no laughing matter. I quite agree with you. With all respect, your Excellency, you must go now. He's lost a great deal of blood. His only hope is to rest. You must go now. I thought I gave orders in this infernal place. Where's the Attorney General. Oh there you are. Come along. We must do as we are told. How is he? You had better ask the doctor. So far as I'm concerned, I can tell you this. If Charles gets better, I shall send him home in disgrace. If he dies, I shall hang your husband. Whatever happens, I will not have a violent brute like Mr. Flusky traipsing about my colony. He'll go back to the convict settlement where he belongs. Well that is impossible. Well it isn't impossible, believe me. In this colony, a convict or an emancipist is only allowed his freedom providing he behaves himself. But it was an accident, he was not to blame. It was nobody's fault. My dear Lady, I had an admirable chance of forming my opinion about Mr. Flusky last night. He's known as a violent fellow. He narrowly escaped the scaffold. No, no, no. He's not that kind of a man. He's an ex convict and this is his second offense. It was all wrong. He should have never been a convict. Good heavens, Madam. He shot your own brother. No. No, I shot my brother. You know what you're saying? Yes, Yes I know. Sam took the blame. I promised him that I would never let it be known. Maybe he'll forgive me. When he knows why. But Lady Hattie. If you persist in this story, I shall have to do my duty. I'm an old soldier. I've only one religion. My duty. The Attorney General will tell you what my duty would be. Yes, his Excellency is quite right, naturally. If you adhere to your confession of a capital crime, I'm of the opinion that it would necessitate your returning to Ireland, to stand your trial. It's the truth I must tell you. Sam and I ran away, you know about that. I hired a thief to bring me out. He wouldn't let me see Charles. They think he may die. If he lives, He'll be sent back home in disgrace. They seem to think it would be better if he died. I saw the Governor. The Attorney General was there too. What is it, his name? Corrigan. Yes, that was it, Corrigan. Neither of them believed a word I said. Just like a bad dream. They are going to send me back to Ireland. You see, I had told them that I had shot Dermot. I know, Sam. I broke my word to you, it had to be. It was the only way. Oh God! The relief, the blessed heavenly relief. So it's to Ireland is it? That's why they are sending you back. You've surely arrange that well, you and that high and mighty, Governor. The honorable Charles Adare, gets packed off home and her Ladyship follows after. And what do I do? Sit here and mind the house, till you've played the game out in Dublin? Keep this fireside cozy until your fancy man gets tired of you and pitches you out? You're wrong, you're wrong. If you think that Sam, then come with me. Come with you to what? What to be a stable boy again, to trade all this for that? After all the time it's taken me. You want me to chuck it out now. Well I won't. You've wasted the years I did for you. You've been fool enough to spill your story, so you pay for it this time, not me. Sam, I did it for you. They would have prosecuted you. Be hanged for a tale. I saw you the other night. You've been mighty clever. Well you go with your jumping jack and see how well you like it. I'm done with you! No, Sam, Sam, you don't know what you are saying. Sam, it's all wrong! It's all wrong! Don't take it too seriously Madam, he doesn't mean half of what he says. You look ill, don't you think you should have something to drink? I didn't know you were left handed. Neither did I, It's fortunate, isn't it? I'm sorry. I beg your pardon. It's an infernally hot evening. We should have a storm. I've just seen the doctor, he says you're much better. Lucky devil. Oh, I'm alright. I'm to go out next week. And what have we to do with you then? What am I to say to your father and Aunt Carrie? I shall have to send you home, you realize? Oh yes, yes sir. Oh you may think you're the devil of a fellow, but I can't afford scandals in my colony. It's awkward too. Naturally, you and her Ladyship can't go back on the same ship. What do you mean? She left him after all, is she going home? Well, she is being sent home. But that's no affair of yours. You leave that to Corrigan and me. What's that dirty little blaggard got to do with it? Mr. Corrigan has his duty to do, the same as the rest of us. However unpleasant that duty may be. What is this? What are you doing to her? She has confessed to the crime that Flusky was sent out here for. According to her, she shot her brother. Confessed? That's an extraordinary thing to do. Is she alright? You had better ask the doctor, He's on his way out there now. It appears she has gone back to some of her old habits. Well, you really must excuse me now. I'm glad, you're so much better. Good night, Doctor. The doctor is gone. Dinner will be ready soon. What did he say? Can I sit down? He wouldn't believe how bad she was. I told him she was seeing things. The horror is back again. You know, what she had before. He strengthened her sleeping draft. Strong stuff it is too. 5 drops in 4 hours. What else did he say? Well she was at him, and at him, about when she would be fit for travel. What did he say? Not much, he held her off. He knows more than he cares to say, being so close to government house. One thing he did say is that Adare is getting better. That's a load off my mind. Still, the Lord works in mysterious ways, wonders to perform. It will all turn out for the best. Once her Ladyship is gone, you'll be able to get some peace. You've never known peace, have you Mr. Flusky? I'm going with her. You're going with her? Yes, I must the way she is. But the house, Mr. Flusky. What will you do with the house? I'll sell everything. But you'll be done for if you go. You're somebody here. You'll be nobody there. I know all that. Nothing matters now anyhow. She'll have her friends, they won't do anything to an. Earl's daughter. Leave it to all the Lords and Ladies. Mr. Adare should be alright. It's madness to go Mr. Flusky. Don't do it, Sir. Stay here with me. I'll look after you. I'll work to the death for you, you know I will. Don't do it, Mr. Sam. I've made up my mind. You've never know me to go back on that. Milly? Milly! I'll go. You can't go up now, Mr. Flusky. She's in no condition to see you. Shut the windows. I'm in charge of her Ladyship. Leave her to me, Mr. Flusky. You do as you're told. Hattie! Hattie! Hattie. Sam, come to me. Come close to me, I want to speak to you. Please make it go away, please. Make it go away. There on the bed. It is always there. Always the same, grinning at me. There is nothing there. Pull yourself together. You must shoot it, Sam. Don't you see it? Charles saw it, he shot it, and it went away. He saw nothing, he was only humoring you. It's all in your mind Hattie. There is nothing there I tell you. See for yourself. There's nothing there. You've been dreaming. The wind, blew the candles. The shadows moved. Can't you see what you are doing to yourself? Face it, face up to it. If you go on like this, you'll go off your head. Now then, Lady Henrietta. You mustn't give way. I've brought you something to drink. Take this. Then you can go to bed and sleep. Drink it all down. Sam! Quiet now, you'll wake the whole house. Sam! Sam! Help me! There's nothing to be afraid of. What's the matter, what is it? Have you sent his woman here to kill me? What are you talking about? She's not responsible, She tried to make me take the sleeping draft all of it in that glass, I saw her. Now look what you made me do. The basket, Look in the basket. So this is the way of it, is it? You'd work till the death for me, eh? The death alright. You drove me to it, how could I let you go? Did you think I'd stand by and see you sacrifice yourself, I know the Lord's way when I see it. I can't make it out. Hattie you don't think that I. No, no, of course not. Ask her why she did it. I thought she was my friend. I'm not your friend. She was ruining herself herself, well I helped her. You gave her the drink all along. Milly, I don't understand, are you in love with him? Don't dare to say that. The Lord will never forgive you for saying that. After all this time, You've been trying to kill me. You were trying to kill yourself. When I was wretched and despaired, you brought me the stuff. Every night, more and more. You wanted it. Yes, I wanted it. And you wanted me to become what I have become so that my husband should hate me. You chose a kinder way tonight. Don't listen to her, she's mad. It's the drinking. The doctor said it would come to this in the end. The Lord's punished her. That's sack bullery. I've seen what you were trying to do. I want to know, Sam. What kind of love drives you to make such horrible things? I don't understand that kind of love. When you and I speak of love, we don't mean the same thing. You knew that Sam, didn't you? Whatever has happened to us, you knew that. Why did you want to kill me? Do you think he could love a murderess? He married one. Oh no, Mr. Flusky. I'm not good enough for you, I know that. I'm only good enough to work for you. And slave for you. And look after your drunk of a wife. No! Oh Sam, let her go. She can do us no harm now. Shall I take your cloaks, gentlemen? No. Your a broad late, gentlemen. Yes I thought it better to come at night. The Governor is anxious to avoid scandal if possible. What do you want? We want a statement from you Flusky. Come into my room. No. We can put it into legal form later on. You are no doubt aware, that your wife has confessed to the murder of her brother. We require you collaborate her statement. This will help to make the proceedings more expeditious. It will avoid painful delays. It will also I may tell you, gain you a free pardon. I must help you to hang my wife, eh? Neat and quick, to save you trouble. I should hardly of put it that way. It comes to this. You can do nothing to her without my evidence. In a sense, yes. I'll put it another way. You can take yourselves out of here. Very well then. I have to inform you that a warrant has been issued for your arrest, for the attempted murder of Charles Adare. If you persist in your attitude that warrant will be put into execution immediately. That was an accident. I am also to remind you that you are an ex convict and this is New South Wales. You are a second offender. You know what that means? Yes. I know what that means. You have been guilty of an act of violence. For that alone, we could hang you, out of hand. But I don't think we shall do that. We shall merely return you to those activities with which you are thoroughly familiar. You should find it easy enough to re-adapt yourself to the simple routine of a chain gang. But I didn't shoot Mr. Adare. What does he say himself? I tell you it was an accident. Be that as it may be, I've been very generous to you Flusky. I've given you a chance to prove that you are not in fact an ex convict. That would make a difference you know. A vast difference. I shall give you until tomorrow morning, to think over what I said to you. Good night. What is it, Sam? Who are these men? Corrigan and his assistant. What do they want? Nothing. I was in no mood to listen to their legal jargon. I sent them packing. Oh they can't touch you now, I have confessed. Yes, you've confessed. Well, what else do they want? They want my evidence too. You were determined to risk your neck for me, weren't you? What else could I do? No, sacrifice. Sacrifice. All along, we've sacrificed ourselves for each other. There must be an end to it. The law said a killing was done. The law said a killing was paid for. Why must they, go on, and on, and on. Nobody can touch you. Nobody can hurt you. I'm safe with you now. We should always be together. Don't talk. Tomorrow will look after itself. Sam. Don't talk anymore. Escort, about face. Stand your horses. Prepare to mount. Up you get, Sir. Get up behind you. Hold your head high, Hattie. We aren't beaten yet. Alright there, Will. Winter. Order the carriage. I'm going into Sydney. What's the good of talking like that? They're treating him like an ex-convict and they have no right to do that. Mr. Corrigan gave him his opportunity last night. He has only to say one word. I saw him this morning, he will never never do that. The he will stay where he is. Oh Sir Richard, don't you see that I am desperate? What do you want me to do? I have confessed that I killed Dermot, to show you that Sam should have never been in prison at all. I've told you the truth about how Mr. Adare was shot. Hasn't Mr. Adare told you? Mr. Adare is a sick man. We shall get his story in good time. In the meantime, it isn't necessary. The servants heard high language and a pistol shot. I saw the man myself an hour before it happened. He was capable of anything. This is intolerable. What are you doing here? Why are you out of bed? Hattie. They had told me you had come. I heard you were ill. What's all this about a confession? No, no I'm not ill. How are you, Charles? Why are you here? They've put Sam in prison. But I don't understand. What's happened? Our friend is cooling his heels in the city jail. You should be that last to object to that. You've helped me. More than anybody knows. Help me now. Tell them that they must set Sam free. Tell them what happened. They must set him free. Give him back to me, Charles. They say that he tried to kill you. Tell them that it was an accident. Whatever happened he is better within four walls. It's safer for you, It's better for me, and better for Lady Henrietta, if I may say so. This murderess. Sir Richard. - Mr. Adare. - Lady Henrietta, you know what happened. I know what happened. Have you anything to say, Charles? If so, please give your account now and get out of my office. Well, when I took Lady Henrietta home, after the ball. Flusky came back shortly after. He was angry. Very angry. You know that Richard, you saw him. Never mind why, but he ordered me out of the house? I took his mare and started back for Sydney. It was pitch dark we, ran into a fence, a closed fence. I couldn't see. We landed up in a ditch. I was shaken, but the horse broke one of it's forelegs. I made my way back and told Flusky. He went off, and got a pistol. Then he went out and shot the poor beast. When he came back, I... took hold of the pistol. It was a large double barreled, and I handled it clumsily and I took a charge in my shoulder, that's all. Lady Henrietta said there was a quarrel. Was there, did she say that? Well, Flusky wasn't exactly delighted at losing his favorite mare. He probably said so, I forget. I may tell you Sir, that I don't believe a word of your story, not a word. Never the less, that will be my evidence. On your word of honor, as a gentleman. Is that all that happened that night? As a gentleman. Corrigan, we shall have to release him. But your excellency it's not so simple as that. - To begin with. - Do as I say. Lady Henrietta, as you are no doubt satisfied that I have done all I can for you, will you please go away. I'm too busy to entertain Ladies. I can understand that, Sir. I'm very much obliged to you. Bye Sam. Mr. Adare. I've got a lot to make up to you. Good bye for now, Sir. I'll be the first man to go back to the old country without making a fortune. I'll be the rage of Dublin. Goodbye, Hattie. Good bye, Charles. Don't forget me. I won't ever forget you. We'll be sorry to lose you, Sir. If I may say so, Winter, I'm sorry to go. It's not a bad place. They say there's some future for it. It must be. It's a big country. Then why are you leaving. Sir? That's just it, Winter. It's not quite big enough. Goodbye. Good luck.
