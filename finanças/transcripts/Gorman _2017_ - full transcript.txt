You okay? You hit your head outside so I brought you in here. - Who are you? - I'm Jack. - Okay. - Okay, I guess you were cleaning the cabin and you must've fallen off the steps. - No, no, no, I was, I was outside and I was on the phone... No dude, I booked this cabin for the weekend. - What? No. No. - Yeah. - I booked this cabin for the weekend. - Me too. - No. (Paper rustling) My confirmation number. - All right wait. What's going on? Here. (Keypad clicking) Look. Confirmation number YUT7754 Brittany Reed. - This must be a joke, right? - No, this is not a joke all right? You're trespassing and you need to leave. - No, I made my reservation a long time ago so it's mine. Please. - I'm not leaving all right? I am going to call the owner because this is absolutely absurd. (Jack sighs) (keypad beeping) (line ringing) (phone beeping) (Brittany sighs) Of course there's no reception. - [Jack] Oh, I'll try. - [Brittany] Like you're gonna get reception with that thing. (Wind chime chiming) (line ringing) - [Thomas] Hello? - Thomas? - [Thomas] Yeah? - Hi, this is Jack speaking. - [Thomas] Who? - Jack, I rented your cabin for the weekend. - [Thomas] Oh, the French guy. - Yeah. Listen, there's a, another person here. It's a young girl and says she rented the cabin as well but that can't be right? - [Thomas] Yeah that could be. - What do you mean? - [Thomas] I musta double booked the cabin all right? - What? - [Thomas] It happens. - Wait, okay hold on. Hold on please. (Jack sighs) (crow cawing) Thomas, can you repeat what you just said. - [Thomas] I said I musta double booked the cabin all right? What do you want me to do? Jump in my truck and drive up there? I don't think so. Figure it out, okay? - So, you double booked the cabin? - [Thomas] Yeah pal, I double booked the cabin. Big fuckin' deal. (Line clicks) - Asshole. (Crow cawing) - What now? - Here, I'm gonna give you $500 so you can leave now. - I'm not leaving. - Please. - No, no, I have been planning this for weeks and I am staying here okay? - Okay, 750? - Dude, did you not hear me? I'm not leaving okay? Just get your money back from that guy and book somewhere else. - I'm not leaving so you make your choice. Either you leave now or I'll make you leave all right? (Crow cawing) - Okay. I think that we can find a way to figure this one out, okay? - Please, come on. Oh! (Fist thuds) (crow cawing) Oh, no! Just a careless American! You're out of your mind!

(Brittany sobbing) (gentle music) (Jack knocking) - [Jack] I need to use the bathroom. (Brittany panting) (Jack pounding) Hello? - There is no bathroom. - [Jack] What? - There's no bathroom. (Floorboards creaking) (Brittany panting) (Jack sighs) (urine splashing) (bugs chirping) (wind whistling) Are you still there? - [Jack] What? - Why this cabin? (Jack scoffs) (bugs chirping) - I could ask you the same question. (Bugs chirping) (wind chime chiming) I'm a writer. I came here to finish my novel. (Bugs chirping) (wind chime chiming) - How cliche. - It's not cliche if it's true. - First or second? - Does it matter? - Well you're not a real novelist if you haven't written a single book. So what's it about? - I'm sorry? - Your book. - Oh. Yeah, it's, it's a work in progress. - You have no idea. - Do you know the story of "Lolita?" It's a classical story about a young woman who was having a relationship. - It's disgusting. I've read it. - It's not disgusting. It's about innocence and the loss of it through lust and love, not disgusting. - Just don't use my real name. - [Jack] I wasn't going to. - Good. (Jack chuckles) - Of course. - You know I'm not afraid of you. - Clearly. What are you doing here? - My boyfriend broke up with me. - That is cliche. (Wind chime chiming) There will be more boys trust me. You should think about more important things like your studies, your career. Boys. All they want is to get into your pants. - All right, all right that's enough dad advice for one day. I'm good, thank you. (Curtain rungs clattering) (flies buzzing) (bugs chirping) (gentle music) (pills clattering) (gentle music) (crow cawing) (gentle music) (Brittany grimaces) (crow cawing) (pills rattling) (gentle music) (crow cawing) (wind chime chiming) (gentle music) (Jack grunts) (bugs chirping) (Brittany's throat clears) (crickets chirping) What? I got bored. (Crickets chirping) - How's your head? - It's okay. Took some aspirin. (Crickets chirping) - When I was your age I was never bored. (Brittany grunts) (Brittany coughing) - Hey, you okay? (Brittany coughs) - No, no, no, no, no, no. (Brittany sighs) When a person's choking, if you hit their back like that you're gonna drive the block deeper instead of expelling it. - Wow. You learn that in college? - "Wikipedia." - Ah. - Uh huh. (Crickets chirping) So you're French? - Yeah. - Did you grow up in France? - No. Morocco. - But you're French. - Yeah, my Dad moved us to Morocco when I was seven. We lived in Agadir eight years. Best years of my life. But then we had to move back to Paris. What about you? - Faith, North Carolina. - Faith? - Mm hm. Population 987. At least the last time I checked that's what it was. I don't know. Could be different now. What about you? How many people are in Aga-da-nin-uh-nuh? (Jack chuckles) Or whatever you called it. - Agadir. - [Brittany] Yeah. - Back then 400,000. I'm sure it doubled by now. (Crickets chirping) So your boyfriend, why did he leave? - I don't wanna talk about it. - I don't really drink. - Why? - I don't wanna talk about it. - Okay. (Brittany sighs) So I mean, what are you really doing here? - I told you, I'm a writer. - You don't look like a writer. - Well, what do they look like? - I don't know. But I feel like you should have like a laptop and a notepad or something. (Jack chuckles) - You should go easy on that. - Look, that's twice now you've given me dad advice. One more time and I take away the hammock. Look, I appreciate the basic male need to be a father figure but I am a grown woman. I can take care of myself. (Crickets chirping) What? - Nothing. You remind me of someone. - Jesus, don't say your ex girlfriend. That'd be like the worst pickup line I've ever heard. (Jack sighs) I'm rude. Do you want a ham and cheese sandwich? - No thank you. - They're really good. You should get in on it. - I don't eat ham. (Brittany sighs) (crickets chirping) (Jack chuckles) - I'm gonna slaughter this sandwich for you. Completely ham-less just for you. (Crickets chirping) What? - You eat your sandwich like her. - Who? - Sophie. - Who's Sophie? - My daughter. - I like that name. It's pretty. Sophie. How old is she? - She's dead. Hit and run. Uh, they found the driver afterwards. He was drunk. (Jack's throat clears) - Wow. - They rushed her to the hospital, but it was too late. Yeah, when they called us (chuckles), there was nothing they could do about it. (Jack sighs) (somber music) - I'm so sorry. (Crickets chirping) (somber music) How old was she? - 12. (Somber music) Too young. (Jack sighs) (somber music) Instead of trying to save her they just wrote her off. (Jack sighs) The doctor came and they told me that it would be better to pull the plug now then later. Can you imagine? Ask a man to be the hand that will end his daughter's life. But I had to do it. She was suffering so much. (Brittany sighs) - I mean, to be fair it did probably save you a lot of money on medical bills. That's one way of looking at it. - That is what it's all about for you? Paying the bills? Money? - No. (Jack chuckles) - You Americans always have this word in your mouth, money. In the meantime you have all these people dying in your streets. You don't even have a respect for them. (Jack sighs) (Brittany sighs) - Well, first of all look, I'm sorry for what I said. It was incredibly insensitive, but I'm not the poster child for America so don't paint all Americans with the same fuckin' brush, okay? And if you hate America so much why don't you go back to France? Just a thought. - You know, the rest of the world is laughing at you. But you don't care of course. (Brittany sighs) (crickets chirping) I need to rest now. - Well, um, thanks for the company I guess. And I'm sorry about what I said about Sophie. I... I'm sure she was a really awesome girl. (Crickets chirping) (Jack sighs) (crickets chirping) (wind whistling) (crickets chirping) (Sophie exhales) (crickets chirping) (wind whistling) (owl hooting) (crickets chirping) (object thuds) (eerie music) (owl hooting) (wind chime chiming) What was that? (Eerie music) (owl hooting) A crow? - Mm hm. It must have fallen from the sky. - That's so creepy. - It's not creepy, it's just nature. (Crickets chirping) - It's dead. - Yeah. It's good luck you know? - What? - A dead crow. - I don't see how this has anything to do with luck. - You should check "Wikipedia." (Jack sighs) - Oh shit. You weren't kidding about the gun. - No. - What do you even need a gun for? - Protection. - From what? - You. (Brittany laughs) Okay. - Hey wait, wait, where are you going? We can't just leave him here. I mean shouldn't, shouldn't we bury him or something? (Jack smirks) I'm going to. (Owl hooting) (Brittany panting) Will you make me a cross? - How do you know the crow was Christian? - Oh you're right, he was probably a Satanist. You gonna make me a pentagram? That be easier? Here (panting). Use this. What, is this against your religion? - What religion? - I don't know, whatever floats your boat man. (Brittany panting) - I'm an atheist. - Okay, me too. I just think the cross is a nice point marker. I got it. (Crickets chirping) (Brittany panting) Do you think this is it? Like what happens if one day we fall off like this dead crow onto somebody's roof? - This is not how, how it works. - You know for a writer you're not very metaphorical. - What if when you're dead you're just dead? There's nothing, nothing at all. (Crickets chirping) (wind whistling) You okay? - I'm fine. (Brittany sniffles) Sorry. - About what? - For kicking you outta the cabin. (Jack grunts) (crickets chirping) (Jack sighs) - I should head back. - Hey, you know you don't have to sleep outside. There's plenty of room in the cabin. - I'm okay. - [Brittany] I mean it. - No, it's fine. Really. - No, I... Okay look, I'm gonna make a formal request. Please come and sleep inside the cabin. Look, it's really creepy out here and this dead crow falling on the roof is kinda freakin' me out. And I don't wanna be alone. (Crickets chirping) Okay, how 'bout this? What if I leave in the morning? No fuss. Will you sleep inside? - Yeah. (Crickets chirping) (Brittany sniffling) (Brittany sighs) (crickets chirping) (Jack sighs) - Goodnight. - Goodnight. (Crickets chirping) (Jack sniffling) (Jack sighs) (crickets chirping) (Brittany sighs) (crickets chirping) I didn't come here because my boyfriend broke up with me. - You should sleep now. (Crickets chirping) (Jack sighs) - I haven't been able to sleep soundly since I was seven. - [Jack] Insomnia? - Nope. - Your parents they, they didn't read bed stories to you? Tell you how to count sheep? - My Mom's a flight attendant so I saw her maybe a collective 10 times in a given year. So no, no sheep or stories. She did take me to Disneyland every year with all of her free miles. That was nice, yeah. That was our happy time. I always looked forward to that. - Oh. And your father? - He never wanted a daughter. - [Jack] Not much of a father. - Nope. (Crickets chirping) He used to hit me a lot. - I'm, I'm sorry to hear that. (Crickets chirping) (Brittany sniffles) - [Brittany] I forgave him for that actiones, never the why. (Crickets chirping) - What's the why? - I don't think you wanna peer down that rabbit hole Alice. - No, but I think you want me to. (Crickets chirping) - My, my dad's brother, my uncle used to touch me. Not in a loving way, a way in which someone with no remorse touches you. Whenever we would go and visit his family, night after night I would just have to lay there and let it happen to me without making a sound. (Somber music) (Brittany sniffles) When I um, told me dad, he said he didn't tolerate liars. He didn't want a liar living in his house. My Mom took me to a shrink. They tried to put me on medication but that didn't work. It's all my fault. - No. It's not your fault. Your uncle was a sick man and you were just an innocent child. - I'm not innocent. (Brittany sobbing) (somber music) - Hey. (Brittany sobbing) (somber music) It's okay. (Brittany sobbing) (somber music) Hey, it's okay, it's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. - [Brittany] You don't know that. - Yes. It's gonna be okay. (Brittany sobbing) (somber music) No. It's gonna be okay sweetheart. - [Brittany] What are you doing (panting)? - What? - Why would you do that? - I was comforting you, I-- - No, don't! - But I thought this was what you wanted? - No, no (panting). You need to leave right now (panting). You need to leave right now. You need to leave right now! - Calm down, okay? I'm sorry. (Brittany gasping) - I have to go. I have to go. - Hey? (Somber music) (Brittany sobbing) (wind chime chiming) (somber music) (Brittany sobbing) (somber music) Hey! (Somber music) (Brittany sobbing) Hey. (Jack panting) (somber music) I don't know what to say. Uh, I thought-- - No, you didn't think. - I'm sorry. - Do you have any idea what that kinda shit can do to a person like me? - It was a mistake, okay? (Somber music) (wind whistling) - It's all my fault. - It's not your fault. - [Brittany] Will you stop saying that? (Wolf howling) (somber music) - Come, please let's go back. (Somber music) Come on. (Crickets chirping) (somber music) (wind chime chiming) (crickets chirping) - This is definitely not what I had in mind when I booked this cabin. - [Jack] Me neither. - Blacking out, the dead crow, you coming onto me. - I didn't come on-- - It's fine. It's whatever. Tell me about France, you know? What's it like? I've always dreamed of going to a Parisian cafe and just people watching. - Well, I didn't grow up in Paris. I grew up in the suburbs. (Speaking in foreign language) Trust me, it doesn't exactly look like a French postcard. Kind of place where the French government never manage to handle the anger, the frustration. Some of my best friends got really into violence, ideologies. I joined the police. - You're a cop? - Not anymore. - Well, you retired? - My family, we didn't feel safe anymore. I made a lot of enemies there so... (wind chime chiming) (crickets chirping) People were coming after me. (Gentle music) (crickets chirping) I just, I just wanted a better life for Sophie, for my wife. So we aimed for the American dream. Starting a new life here. (Jack sighs) (gentle music) (crickets chirping) - Somebody come after you? (Gentle music) (crickets chirping) What did they want? - I don't wanna talk about it. - That's right, sorry. (Brittany sighs) (gentle music) (crickets chirping) - You? - I came here to die. - You're sick? - No. Just tired. - Tired? - Mm hm. The day in and day out struggle to try and find happiness. It's just exhausting. I don't wanna suffer anymore. (Brittany sniffles) - [Jack] The pills? - It hurts the least. - You don't really wanna die. - We all wanna die at some point. Anyone that says they don't is just fooling themselves. Everyone has a time and my time has come. - [Jack] Why now? Why here? - Oh, just get away for the weekend. All the chaos in my head (sniffles). Go quietly. - And I showed up and ruined everything huh? (Brittany chuckles) - [Brittany] Pretty much. (Jack chuckles) - Well, I suppose I should apologize. - No. (Crickets chirping) (gentle music) (Jack sighs) - Don't do it. - You're getting dangerously close to strike three Jack. - This is not a dad's advice. - [Brittany] I appreciate it but I have made up my mind. (Somber music) (crickets chirping) - If you were going to kill yourself why did you take my money? (Crickets chirping) (somber music) - You needed to know who was calling the shots. - You were not. (Brittany chuckles) - I guess not anymore, huh? (Brittany sniffles) Here. (Gentle music) (crickets chirping) I'm not gonna need this tomorrow. - No. - All right. Maybe I'll just leave it on my body, you know? As like a prize for someone that finds me. - If they find you. - They'll find me. And if they don't care enough to find me then you know, you'll always know where I am. - I suppose. (Somber music) (crickets chirping) - Will you promise that you'll come visit me from time to time? (Crickets chirping) (somber music) (Jack sighs) - Goodnight Brittany. (Somber music) (crickets chirping) - [Brittany] How do you know I haven't taken the pills? - You haven't. - Are you sure about that? (Crickets chirping) - Goodnight. (Crickets chirping) (owl hooting) (wolf howling) (crickets chirping) (somber music) (Jack sighs) (Brittany grunts) (somber music) (lock clicking) (crickets chirping) (somber music) Damn. (Somber music) (crickets chirping) (pills clattering) (somber music) (Jack grunts) (somber music) (crickets chirping) (Jack panting) (Jack groans) (somber music) (crickets chirping) (Jack exhales) (Jack chuckles) (somber music) (crickets chirping) (Jack speaking in foreign language) (wolf howling) (wind howling) (crickets chirping) (Jack sighs) (birds chirping) (wind chime chiming) (Jack groaning) (birds chirping) - Morning sunshine. (Brittany panting) How was your party? (Tense music) - What are you doing? - I was actually gonna ask you the same thing but then I kinda answered it for myself when I found all of this. (Jack panting) - You had no right to go through my stuff. - Look who's talking. - Please, this is not a toy all right? - No shit. - You don't know what you're doing. (Jack exhales) - Really? - No. - Don't move. (Tense music) (keypad beeping) - If you connect the wires the right way, and a call is made it will go off. (Brittany panting) (keypad beeping) (phone ringing) (Brittany panting) I was going to tell you. - I don't believe you. - You, you should go. You should leave, now. - Not so fast. Why do you have this? - You wouldn't understand. - Make me. - It's, I'm not a terrorist. - Who are you? - I told you, I was a cop. (Tense music) - You're gonna have to do better than that. - Okay. Okay. (Jack sighs) My real name is Laurent. I was part of the GIGN. The French counter terrorism unit. Bomb squad. I studying bombs, how to diffuse them, how to make them. I knew everything about terrorists. Their cells, who trained where. Who came in and out of the country. One day they found me. They threatened my family. We had to leave France and come here. - Who are they? - During one of our raids, we arrested the son of a radical terrorist. His father promised to have my head. But here they couldn't find me for years. Then they expanded their cells in the States, and somehow when the accident with Sophie happened-- - If she's even real. - She was. They figured out where I was living. So they showed up one night proposing a deal. They would take care of the bills, her life support, they would pay for the best doctors, in exchange for a favor. - They're using you Laurent. You were better than this. You're, you're not a terrorist. You're just a guy that's been taken advantage of and doesn't know a way out. You're not gonna be responsible for killing innocent Americans. - Innocent? (Laurent scoffs) No one is innocent. You can't expect starting a war on the other side of this world and just not taking and responsibility for it. - Are you defending them right now? Because what they're doing is pretty untenable. Did they, did they brainwash you or something? Is that what's happening here? Where is this gonna be used? (Tense music) Tell me. And if you have to kill me after you tell me then you know that that is fine with me. Because at least I'm not afraid. Unlike you. (Vest rustling) (somber music) - Las Vegas, Times Square. Places where American people go to be happy. (Somber music) - I hate you. - You wanted to know. How does it feel knowing that your dirty little bomb is going to kill hundreds of innocent people who are just trying to have a happy time in their otherwise shitty lives? Does it make you feel like a real man? Is that it? (Brittany panting) I'm sure your daughter would be very proud. - [Laurent] Stop it. - You need to get it through your thick French scull Laurent. No matter how many jobs you make for these wack jobs, she's not coming back. - Don't. - She's gone. She's dead Laurent and you are disrespecting her memory. Sophie is not an excuse to build bombs! - Stop it! (Brittany gasping) - You stop it! - Why do you care? My life is meaningless! - If yours is meaningless then what is mine? It's not too late Laurent. (Brittany gasps) (Brittany panting) Oh man. (Brittany panting) (gentle music) - [Laurent] I can't. - Keep going (panting). (Wind chime chiming) (Laurent panting) (Laurent sighs) (wind chime chiming) (wind whistling) (flies buzzing) (wind whistling) Thank you. - [Laurent] For what? - For not, you know. (Wind chime chiming) My dad got me a stuffed turtle every year on my birthday. They're such precious creatures surrounded by this hard rough shell, and they get to choose when they come out and expose themselves. The fucker can have 'em all back. (Phone ringing) (wind whistling) - You have to go now. - No. - You can't stay. - I still have a reservation, remember? - There's no time for jokes Brittany. If he finds you here he's gonna kill you. - I'm not leaving. - Then we both die. (Gentle music) (wind chime chiming) I won't do it. I'll find a way out of it. (Gentle music) (wind chime chiming) (Laurent sighs) (gentle music) (wind whistling) (Brittany panting) (gentle music) (wind chime chiming) (gentle music) (Jack sighs) (wind chime chiming) (wind whistling) (crow cawing) (gentle music) (Brittany panting) (gentle music) (Laurent panting) (wind whistling) (Mehdi speaking in foreign language) Mehdi. (Mehdi speaking in foreign language) (Laurent speaking in foreign language) (Mehdi speaking in foreign language) (gentle music) (wind whistling) (Brittany exhaling) (gentle music) (Mehdi speaking in foreign language) (Laurent speaking in foreign language) (Mehdi speaking in foreign language) (Laurent speaking in foreign language) (Mehdi speaking in foreign language) - No. (Gentle music) (wind whistling) (Mehdi speaking in foreign language) (Laurent speaking in foreign language) (Mehdi speaking in foreign language) (Laurent speaking in foreign language) (Mehdi speaking in foreign language) No. (Mehdi speaking in foreign language) (Laurent speaking in foreign language) (Mehdi speaking in foreign language) - Drop the gun! - Brittany, stay out of this! (Mehdi speaking in foreign language) (Laurent speaking in foreign language) (Brittany gasps) Okay. Brittany please. Drop the gun. Do it. Please. (Brittany screams) (Mehdi grunts) (Mehdi groaning) (Laurent groaning) (fists thudding) (men grunting) (shot firing) (Brittany panting) (Laurent panting) (bugs chirping) (Brittany gasping) (bugs chirping) We have to go. - Well what about him? We can't, we can't just leave him there. - [Laurent] Come. - [Brittany] Well someone's gonna come... What about your stuff? - Leave it. Come. Take your things. Come. (Wind whistling) Give me your phone.
