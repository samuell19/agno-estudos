Where did you get that girl? Oh, you lucky devil Where did you get that girl? Tell me on the level Have you ever kissed her? If she has a sister Lead me, lead me Lead me to her mister Gee, I wish that I had a girl I'd love her, I'd love her Oh, goodness, how I'd love her If you can find another I'll take her home to Mother Where? Where? Where did you get that girl? Five bows and an encore. Not bad for a Tuesday night, huh? They loved you, Jess. Come on, I'll buy you a steak. Hey, wait. I wanna watch Mendoza's opening trick. - What, again? - Hi, Jess. Bert, big news. I just closed the deal for you. Eighty weeks solid on the Orpheum time. Two seasons straight. How do you like that? Watch this. It's terrific. Here's your new song. Hot off the presses. "'Where Did You Get That Girl? ' Words by Bert Kalmar... ...co-author of 'Hello, Hawaii,' 'Oh! What a Pal Was Mary."' - Am I an agent? - Yeah, yeah. Now, look. - Hey, what's going on? - Magic is going on. Come in. - Oh, I thought you'd be dressed by now. - Jess, listen. Come here. I've got a great idea, an opening for the new act. I come out in one, see? I'm a magician. - Oh, a magician. - Yeah. I'm in a full dress suit, medals on my chest... ...maybe a mustache and a little goatee. Yes, I adore little goatees. And you come on as my assistant. I hand you my gloves... Hey, wait a minute. - You're not walking out on me, are you? - Not yet. - What you open the door for? - Because I'm a nice girl, Mr. Kalmar. And a nice girl always leaves the door open. You know, we could fix all that so you won't have to worry about doors. We could get married. I'd like that. Maybe someday when you're not so rushed, Bert. So you don't have to propose in short pants. Listen, Jess, I'm not kidding. Neither am I. You're too busy, Bert. A big headliner, important songwriter. A magician. Now you're writing a play. You want to be everything in show business all at once. And I just want to be a wife. You couldn't light in one spot long enough for the ceremony. Okay, Jess. But if you ever do decide to marry me, you'll speak right up, won't you? You'll be the first to know. Thanks, Jess. Well, what about that magic idea? Well, what's the matter? - Just a couple of tricks for an opening? - And for a finish, you saw me in half. Next thing you know, you'll be doing a single. "Kalmar The Magnificent." Maybe you think I couldn't. - Maybe I'll surprise you. - Nothing you did would surprise me. You know, sometimes I think you'd rather be a bad magician... ...than a good actor. - How do I look? - Beautiful. - Do I need a flower? - What for? I think I need a flower. - Pretty fancy, huh? - Just wonderful. - Telephone, Mr. Kalmar. - Okay. Be right back. Clanahan's Paradise, the best beer on the island. See Kendall The Great, miracles and marvels of magic. And appearing on the stage right now, The Four Little Boys in Gray. Fifteen acts of... Jimmy O'Leary said I've got a theory She's different from all of your girls She's not a queen Like you see on the screen And she ain't got No diamonds or pearls But she's mine, all mine Giants 4, Philadelphia 2. End of the seventh. I told her I worked in a glue factory And that's how she happened To get stuck on me - I'll take over. - Thanks. And she's mine, all mine - Hey, Ruby. - Yes, sir? - Where you going? - This is my supper hour. I thought I'd go out for a catch. Yeah? Well, take it on the hop to dressing room four. Kendall The Great needs an assistant. Say, Mr. Clanahan, would you mind... ...if I asked one of the acts to sing a song that I wrote? It's called "On the Shores of Araby." It goes like this: I can't forget the night we met On the shores of Araby The moon lit up the sky And love lit up your eyes I kissed you once I kissed you twice As I held you gently That night upon the shores of Araby - I never... - You wrote that? Yes, sir. Words and music both. Well, take it on the hop to dressing room four. Kendall The Great needs an assistant. Yes, sir. Come in. Mr. Kendall? Ebbetts Field is that way. No, I'm your assistant. Mr. Clanahan said. Okay. Take those boxes backstage and pile them up behind the drapes. Yes, sir. Now, when I'm on, I'll give you signal like this: Whenever you hear that you take the top box... ...shove an animal through the hole in the drapes and into the back of the table. Got it? Animals, huh? - I want them in just that order. - Yeah. Don't fool around with that goose. He's vicious. Well, they usually are. Ladies and gentlemen, since time began... ...man has placed his trust in the witch doctor... ...the sorcerer and the voodoo. Who dares to call them frauds? Watch carefully, please. Is this trickery or magic? Now, I have here a gentleman's ordinary silk hat. As you can plainly see... ...there are no secret pockets and no hidden springs. I place the hat on the table. Go on, get in there. Go on, what are you waiting for? And now, ladies and gentlemen, the identical hat. I'll fill it from this pitcher of water. Like this. Is this trickery or magic? - Oh, look, a goose. - Now, but don't go near him. He's vicious. Look. I would like your attention, please. Watch carefully. Now think of a card. Any card in the deck. A scientific exhibition of mind over matter. For my next deception, I have here a little handkerchief... What's going on...? I'll be right back, Mr. Clanahan. - You see a goose go by here? - I saw a lot of them down there. Watch carefully, please. Ordinary hat. Ordinary drinking water. I pour it in the hat like this: Place it on my head like that. - Where is he? Where is he? - Just a minute, you. That baseball player, if I ever lay my hands on him... Get out of my theater and don't ever come back. I ought to sue you for that performance. I ought to take you to court, you small-time swami. Oh, shut up. - Hello. - What are you doing here? Charlie traced you for me. Nice comedy routine, Bert. That maniac in a baseball hat. I was going great until then. - I had them right there, I was killing them. - Listen to him. Every theater in the country is waiting for Kalmar and Brown... ...but Kendall The Great is killing them in Coney Island at 5 bucks a night. What were you trying to prove? That we ought to use magic in the act? Not necessarily. You know what magic is to me. - It's a hobby. It relaxes me. - You look relaxed. Come in. - Say, a couple of them got away. - Get out of here! Bert Kalmar. That's Bert Kalmar, the songwriter. Say, Mr. Clanahan, that's Bert Kalmar. - I saw him at the Palace. - Yeah. I heard you tell the rabbit. I recognized him without his mustache. Sure, sure. Here, son. And don't look for another job right away. Just take a nice, long rest. Thank you. Thank you. Now, with your kind indulgence we'd like to show you what happens... ...when two dancers get married. Mr. and Mrs. Hoofer at home. Thank you. They loved you, Jess. See them applaud? - Bert, I was so nervous. - So was I. You know... - Sorry, Mr. Kalmar. - My fault. Flowers for you. Oh, they're beautiful. Who are they from? The president and I. We chipped in. - Bert, what is it? - I don't know. "Kalmar and Brown, who opened their new act to bravos last month... ...have been cancelled following an accident backstage. Doctors say Kalmar will not be able to dance... ...for at least a year, possibly two." I couldn't think of a tougher break. It's Jessie I'm thinking about. She can't just sit around waiting. When you lay off too long, they think you're through. And I'm not gonna let that happen to her. Now, why can't she just pick up another partner and take out the same act? Bert, I told you, the act needs your name. She wouldn't make the expenses. - You sunk a lot of dough into it, huh? - Not much. Just everything I own. - Hello. - Hi, Jess. - Hello. - I've ordered breakfast. - How are you, Charlie? - Good. - Hey, doughnuts? - Sure. Why did you have to go shopping? No room service? I figured we'd save the tip. That wolf at the door might get pretty hungry. I've got to catch a rehearsal down at Loew's. - I'll see you, Jess. Bert. - Bye, Charlie. See you later. Come here, honey. Now, listen. That crack about the wolf at the door, that's out, see? - You won't be around to meet him. - No? I've been talking to Charlie. We figured you ought to go out as a single. I can write a new routine. Charlie guarantees the booking, says it's a cinch. You boys have been wasting your time. My plans are all set. I always told you if ever I changed my mind... ...you'd be the first to know. Of course, it took a broken kneecap to make you stop bouncing long enough. But I'm satisfied. Say, maybe you didn't hear me. I just accepted your proposal. Look, Jess... I won't be bouncing for a long time yet. And a fellow with a wife to support has to get around pretty fast, you know. Well, I'm not a girl that needs a new sable every winter. What about your writing, Bert? Your play, your songs? You don't have to click your heels in the air to write a lyric. Now, wait a minute. I'd like to write a great play, sure. Who wouldn't? And those songs, they're just a sideline for fun. I never tried to make a living at it. I'm not even sure I can. Until I find out, l... You don't want me hanging around your neck. Is that it? I didn't say that. Now, don't be sore at me, huh? I'm not sore. But it isn't every day that a girl gets turned down. Jessie, listen. Listen. Jessie! Jessie! Wish you could write another song like that. - I could sure use it. - I'll tell you a secret, Al. - So could I. - Well, what's the matter? Oh, I don't know. I just haven't hit on anything. - I can't seem to get started. - Oh, you will. What do you hear from Jessie? Oh, she framed a new act. Doing fine. Say, what is that? One of your new ones? That? Some Arabian song one of our pluggers wrote. Plays it all day long, drives me nuts. Get me Harry Ruby. I think I'll throw him out of here. Arabian song, huh? Not a bad tune. Yeah, it is kind of catchy. Hello, Ruby, come in here, son. Let you talk to him. You know, an Araby song might be just the thing right now. - Yes, chief? - Oh, come in, Ruby. Bert, this is Harry Ruby. - Bert Kalmar. - Hi. Ruby, Mr. Kalmar wants to hear that Arabian song of yours. Yes. You bet. Yes, sir. It's called "On the Shores of Araby That Night..." "That Night With You." I can't forget the night we met On the shores of Araby The moon lit up the sky And love lit up your eye - Hold it, wait a minute. - Yeah, hold it. - Who wrote that lyric? - Well, I did. Words and music both. Well, you know, you haven't got an Arabian song there. - You don't think so? - No. - Play it again, will you? - Sure. No, no. It's more like Dixie. A Dixie tune. Maybe Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee. Sure. Look. Da-da-da-da in Tennessee Gee, that's swell, Mr. Kalmar. Tennessee. Well, you boys go right ahead. - Take all day if you want. - Okay, Al. Great. Let me see. Da-da-da-da in Tennessee Say, don't I know you? Well, I don't think so, Mr. Kalmar. Da-da-da-da in Tennessee Down among... You worked here long? Oh, for a couple of months, Mr. Kalmar. - Have a cigar. - Oh, gee, thanks. I wanna be in Tennessee That's it. Try it. I wanna be in Tennessee That ought to do it. Here, take it from the top. I wanna be in Tennessee In my Dixie paradise An angel's voice I hear I mean my mammy dear I'd give my soul if I could stroll Down among those hills again For all the world Would not be dreary then I'd love to go to sleep and know That tomorrow I'd arise Beneath those southern skies Where songbirds harmonize Lordy, hear my plea Make me what I wanna be A rolling stone just rolling home To my sunny Tennessee Gosh, that's wonderful, Mr. Kendall. Thanks. Kendall? Oh, I remember now. The pigeons, the rabbits. Oh, I remember you! Please, Mr. Kendall... I mean, Mr. Kalmar. You pin-headed baseball player. Do you realize what you did that night? - It was the goose. - Goose? Goose? Five hundred people out front and... You don't know that goose. He was the meanest thing... I knew I remembered that face. I got a bad feeling the second I saw you. You're a menace. Run away and hide before you do real damage. Let bygones be bygones. Get away from me. I should write a song with a jinx like you. Here. As far as I'm concerned, it never left Araby. Goose. Oh, hello, Mr. Kalmar. I got your message. You write this ad? "The nation's number one song hit, 'My Sunny Tennessee'... ...by that sensational new writing team, Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby." - Well, yeah, you see, l... - Who made you my partner? - Well, nobody, but... - Now, listen, kid. You might as well understand something right now. Because I wrote one song with you doesn't make us roommates. I'm not teaming up with anybody. Soon as I can swing this leg again, I'd be back in vaudeville. Until then, I'll write with anyone who happens to have a good tune. - Now, is that clear? - Sure, that's very clear, Mr. Kalmar. Okay. Where are the doughnuts? Thanks, Johnnie. Well, got any new tunes? As a matter of fact, I've got a tune but I haven't thought of words for it yet. Good. My spikes. Al Schacht gave me those. Al Schacht. He's a pitcher in the big league. Maybe you've heard of him? Al Schacht? - Play the tune. - Sure. Hey, have you got any with chocolate on top? Coming up. You don't like it, huh? Sure, sure. It's a nice little tune. You ought to do something with it sometime. You ought to do something with that shirt too. Real silk, $4. You got any other tunes? Well... Let's see, I... Well, don't pull a ligament. You know... ...there hasn't been a good Japanese song for quite a while. Got something here I thought might work out. I call it "So Long, Oo-long." I figured the rhythm is something like this: So long, Oo-long How long you gonna be gone? You got something to fit that? Well, let's see. How about this? Wait a minute. Try that again, will you? So long, Oo-long How long you gonna be gone? Now, wait a minute. That's the same tune you just played. Well, I know it. Are you trying to put something over on me? - Well, no, I thought it would fit. - Well, it doesn't fit. What's the matter with you, you only got one tune? - I got plenty of tunes in me. - Well, I've only heard one tune. Yeah, I know. Right now, all I got is one rotten tune. Take it easy, kid. Now, don't get excited. - Don't get excited. - Who's excited? I'm not excited. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll leave this lyric. If you come up with something, give me a ring. If you don't, well, don't worry. See you around. So long, Oo-long How long you gonna be gone? Your little Japanee Will be waiting Underneath the bamboo tree So don't be too long, Oo-long I'll long while you're away Waiting for the day When you come back to me I'll sit and sigh 'Neath the oriental sky Each day that I Am left alone In Nagasaki So long, Oo-long How long you gonna roam? Please don't be too long Oo-long, so long Hurry back home Ming Toy Loved a boy Happy little Japanee Oo-long was his name Set her heart aflame - One day, he say - Soon I got to go away - When he leave - Ming Toy grieve Everybody hear her say I'll sit and sigh 'Neath the oriental sky Each day that I Am left alone In Nagasaki So long, Oo-long How long you going to roam? Please don't be too long Oo-long, so long Hurry back home - Hi, boys. - Yes, sir, 10 cents. Right. We have... No, no, no. The Palace tonight. I fixed it with Mrs. Carter DeHaven to hear your song. - Well... - Not that, the new one. If she likes it, she'll introduce it next week. Who's sorry now? Who's sorry now? Whose heart is aching For breaking each vow? Who's sad and blue? Who's crying too? Just like I cried over you Right to the end Just like a friend I tried to warn you Somehow You had your way Now you must pay I'm glad that you're sorry now Right to the end Just like a friend I tried to warn you Somehow You had your way Now you must pay I'm glad That you're sorry now Oh, that's great. Looks like another hit. You're making a habit of it. - Thank you. - We'll introduce it next week. - Oh, good, thanks. - Oh, Bert, how is your knee? - Oh, better, better. Thank you. - Wonderful. I'm glad. Excuse me. - Boys, it was just great, that's all. - Bert, swell. Bert, I want a copy to send on to Jessie. Can't you hear her sing it? - Yeah, sure. - It was like it was written for her. Oh, I suppose you haven't heard the news. - No. - Well, it's not settled yet. But she may team up with Bill Courtney next season. They'll do an act like she used to do with you. Well, it's not definite yet. They ought to do all right. He's a very talented guy. - Yeah. - See you later, Charlie. Yeah, yeah. Good night. Oh, me and my big mouth. Yeah, he doesn't talk about her very much anymore. Hey, where is she playing next week? - Jessie? - Yeah. Montreal, at Queen's Theatre. Why? I'll see you later. Where did you get that girl? Oh, you lucky devil What's the matter? Can't a fella dance if he feels like it? - Well, I didn't say anything. - What are you gaping at? I'm not gaping. I always look this way. - You hurt your leg again, Bert? - No. It's all right. - I just gotta cut out those knee drops. - Yeah. You know what I think? We ought to take a little vacation. I mean it. We've been working too hard. We're tired. It would do us good. We could go to Miami Beach or New Orleans, Hot Springs or Montreal. Why Montreal? Oh, no reason. Nice little town. Might be a nice place to work on that play you're always talking about. Besides, I got some relatives up there... ...and we could get a good home-cooked meal. Hey, Harry, I gave you a bum steer. Jessie is not in Montreal next week, it's Buffalo. Oh, thanks. Well, I got relatives in Buffalo too. I'm sweet Marie from gay Paris This is my new car It fill my heart with joy To drive a Yankee boy On the sly I wink my eye When one come my way I stop the motorcar And then I say Come on, papa Hop in the motorcar Sit by mama And hold the hand You start to raise for me What they call the deuce I'll be so sweet to you Like the charlotte russe Come on, papa Beneath the shining star Bounce your baby Upon the knee I give you the kiss Like the mamselles do Each time you ask for one I give you two And when you're in the car You love mama Ooh la la, ooh la la Come on, papa We make love to you Like you want us to But if you pooh-pooh me I pooh-pooh you But when you're in the car Don't go too far - Ooh la la - Ooh la la Come on, papa Thank you.

Would you like to hear them sing one of their numbers? - Hello, Jess. - Hello, Bert. - Hi, Harry. - Hi, Jessie. Well, what shall we do? "Nevertheless"? Yeah.

I like a little fruit once in a while. Do you mind if I kiss the bride? Bye, Harry. And thanks for everything. You know what I mean. Oh, here, from me to you. Well, now, thanks.

Yeah, what about the team? I don't know. Do you think it should be Kalmar and Ruby... ...or Ruby and Kalmar? Either way. First billing doesn't mean much to songwriters. - Cream, dear? - Yeah, just a little. You mean you're not gonna do the act, that the team's Bert and me? Oh, Jessie, you're wonderful.

Went to Greenwich with a saxophone player. - I guess I shouldn't have left town. - You made a wrong move, son. - Want a drink? - Yeah. - What will it be? - Grape juice, please. Make it two. Not to change the subject... ...but I've been kind of busy while you were away. - Saturday night, huh? - Yeah. Look. - What's this? - Play. My play. I finished it. Oh, swell, Bert. - They went to Greenwich, huh? - Yeah. I want you to read it, Harry. - I'd like your opinion. - Sure. I'm gonna produce it myself. I'm putting up part of the cash. I got a broker from Wall Street putting up the rest. A saxophone player, huh? You're not gonna let this thing throw you. Because if you are, I'm gonna feel terrible. Oh, why should you feel terrible, Bert? You had nothing to do with it. A saxophone player. I haven't slept a wink since I read it. Look, Charlie, I don't know anything about plays... ...but do you think Bert ought to produce this himself? - Nobody else will handle it. - What do you mean? - This script been around to regular producers? - Sure. - What do they say? - Nothing much. A couple of them say it will be a sure-fire flop. Well, did you tell Bert? - You tell him. - Oh, fine. That's all I'd have to do. Look, I'm not worried about the dough he'll lose. I'm thinking of Bert, his pride. He's higher than a kite on this thing, and if it flops, he'll never get over it. - Well, what do you want from me? - I... Look, can Bert handle this without that Wall Street guy? - Not a chance. - Well, then, call him off. Tell him the play is no good. Get him to pull out. Harry, I can't. If Bert is gonna fall on his face, maybe we just better let him. He wouldn't let it happen to me. Look, get that broker on the phone. I'll talk to him myself. What do you mean, he pulled out? - Why would he pull out now? - Bert, please. All I know is that he's out, he doesn't want any part of it. Well, I'm still asking you why. Maybe Mr. Miller just decided he didn't like the play anymore. - Was that it, Charlie? - Yeah, just about. He's a broker. What does he know about plays? Listen, I spent a lot of time on that thing. It's not the first play I've written. I've done six plays. I tore them up because they weren't what I wanted. Now I've got something, I know it. And a broker says it's no good. Oh, I thought it was your first play, Bert. He hasn't talked much about it, but he's worked very hard. Well, I'm no broker, but... Well, anything I've got, you're welcome to, you know that. No, no, no. It's all right, forget it. I gotta go along. I've gotta catch an act at the Fordham. - So long, Bert. - So long, Charlie. - Harry. - I'll see you later, Charlie. Oh, look, Bert. Now, you're not gonna let this thing lick you, are you? Because if you do, it's gonna lick me too. I'd feel awful. Why should you feel awful? Is it your fault a broker doesn't know a good play when he sees it? Try it this way: - That ought to fix it. - I don't think so. - Too many notes. - It's not too many notes. Look... Hey, fellas, can we borrow your piano just a minute? Well, listen. I wanna be loved by you Just you and nobody else but you I wanna be loved by you alone I wanna be kissed by you Just you and nobody else but you I wanna be kissed by you alone Yeah. Come on. Come with us. I wanna be loved by you Just you and nobody else but you I wanna be loved by you alone I wanna be kissed by you Just you and nobody else but you Oh, I wanna be kissed by you alone I couldn't aspire To anything higher Than fill a desire To make you my own I wanna be loved by you Just you and nobody else but you Oh, I wanna be loved by you alone I couldn't aspire To anything higher Than fill a desire To make you my own I wanna be loved by you Just you and nobody else but you I wanna be loved by you Don't know the time Day or the season I just know that I'm Losin' my reason By fallin' in love Don't know the time Day or the season I just know that I'm Losin' my reason By fallin' in love And since I'm in love I'm up in the clouds - Harry, what is it? - Hey. What's the matter? Steward said you wanted to see me. - You all right? - Sure, I'm fine. Remember those lyrics you wrote for Jessie? I think I got a tune for them. "Thinking of You." - You wrote it for me, Bert? - Yeah. Yeah. I wanted to surprise you, but not at 2:00 in the morning. I thought you'd be interested. Go ahead, Jessie, sing it. Why is it I spend the day Wake up and end the day Thinking of you? Oh, why does it do this To me? Is it such bliss To be Thinking of you? And when I fall asleep at night It seems You just tiptoe Into all my dreams So I Think of no other one Ever since I've begun Thinking of you Oh, Bert. - Nice tune, Harry. - Oh, Harry, it's wonderful. Thanks. Thank you for the song, Bert. It's beautiful. You know, Harry never wrote a melody like that before. He must be in love or something. Why does he have to be in love? Songwriting is a business. You could write a love song in a subway train. Not a love song like that. You have to feel it. Didn't you? Oh, I think of you once in a while. Thank you, darling. All the same, I still think Harry's in love. Don't be silly. Just because he writes a romantic tune... ...that doesn't mean he has to be Beethoven. Any good songwriter can... Don't look now, but here comes Beethoven. And Capri was impossible. Actually impossible. Pepi, dear, be a good little sweetheart and run along. Al Schacht. Go on home. Back to third. Go on home. Back to third. Go on home. Back to third. Al. Get her up there, Al. Higher. Thank you. - What about you, Harry? - Me? - Yeah. - Give me the ball. All right. Lift her up. Higher. Higher! - Thank you! - Oh, wait a minute. You all right? Yes. Okay. - Ball took a bad hop. - A bad hop. A bad hop. We go to rehearsal in two weeks. What do I tell Sam Harris? The ball took a bad hop? He'll be delighted. You and your baseball. Every time I turn around, you're playing baseball. - That's for kids. Kid stuff! - Well, I suppose magic's for grownups. - What's magic got to do with it? - Here, pick a card. Pick a card. Don't let me see which one you take. Ace of clubs? Right? Correct. Hooray! It's not the same thing at all. We have no regular partnership. - lf one of us breaks this up, it's okay. - It's all right with me too. - Then that's understood! - Okay! Okay, okay! Now, play this thing again. No, don't play it. Sing it. Hooray for Captain Spalding The African explorer Did someone call me schnorrer? - Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! - Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! How do you think it's going, Bert? Pretty good so far. - Walk around. See what they're saying. - Okay. - Wonderful first act, Mr. Ruby. - Thank you. Oh, hello. Hello there. You don't remember me, do you? Sure. You... - The understudy in The Ramblers. - That's right. Last time we met, you were on your way to Hollywood. How did you make out? All right? - Pretty well. - All right. Good. Bert and I are thinking about going out... Bert, you remember Miss... - How do you do? - Yes. How are you, Mr. Kalmar? They're figuring on making a movie out of The Ramblers. That's wonderful. You must look me up. We sure will. - They're taking our picture. - Yes. One more, please. Thank you. The show must be okay, they're taking our picture. - Well, good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. What do you mean, taking our picture? - I don't suppose you know who that is. - Don't you remember her? She was the understudy in The Ramblers. Nice kid. - You ought to see more movies. - Why? Come here, son. See that sign? There's your understudy. She's a movie star? Oh, she must think I'm crazy. Wait a minute. Now, how could anyone possibly think you're crazy? Oh, come on. I love you so much I can't conceal it I love you so much It's a wonder you don't feel it Yeah, it's all right. It's all right. - You got any other tunes? - Let me see. I got something that'll fit. Of course, you have to take off one word to make it "I love you so." Let's hear it. I love you so I can't conceal it It's a wonder that you don't feel it I love... Harry, cut it out, will you? For the last time, I'm telling you, lay off that tune. What's the matter with it? He's been trying to sell it to me once a week since we met. I can't help it, Bert. I can't think of a title. How can anybody ever think of a title for that thing? - Oh, that's a nice title. - What else can you say? - Play that other thing. - You don't like it. I love it, I'm crazy about it. Play it, will you? Who do you think's gonna be in our picture? - Who? - That understudy. I love you so much I can't conceal it I love you so much It's a wonder you don't feel it I love you so much My eyes reveal it I love you so much It's a wonder you don't feel it I've decided that I am through With all this rambling about I don't know what I'd ever do Without you I'm telling you I love you so much I can't conceal it I love you so much It's a wonder you don't feel it - We love you so much - I don't believe it We can't conceal it We love you so much It's a wonder you don't feel it - We love you so much - I can't believe it Our eyes reveal it We love you so much It's a wonder you don't feel it Now, I've decided that I am through With all this rambling about We don't know what we'd ever do Without you You're telling me We love you so much - I can't believe it - We can't conceal it We love you so much It's a wonder you don't feel it - Because you love me so - Because we love you so Cut! Get a lily. Print three and four. - That was very nice, Eileen. - Thank you. - Sounded swell, Eileen. - Thanks. Don't you ever get tired of watching this? Not the way you do it. You should've been the star in the Broadway version. - Oh, I don't know. - Yes. - You really think so? - Sure. She'd have been great. Why don't you go out and get a cup of coffee? - Who wants coffee? - Coffee's good for you sometimes. My crazy friend Kendall The Great. I mean it. How did we happen to pass you by? - Well, it's a long story. - I'm interested. He's interested. Well, I tried out for the part. It was practically all set. And a fellow brought in another girl. A very pretty girl. - He was a songwriter. - Named Snooky? - That's right. - Snooky? Whoever heard of a songwriter named... Snoo... Me? Oh, you mean that girl l... You're a magician. Make me disappear. I can't forget The night we met - It looks lovely, Lennie. - Thank you. I'll let you know when to light it and bring it in. The moon lit up the sky And love lit up your eye I kissed you once I kissed you twice And I held you gently That night upon The shores of Araby - All right, so I wrote a lyric once. - Oh, no, you didn't. "My Sunny Tennessee" was a great song. This is a very happy, happy anniversary. Happy days. - Get our boy here. - I'm celebrating with my friends. You know, this is the third time in my life I've had more than one drink. - Very interesting. - Yes, it is. Come here, Charlie. Very interesting. - I didn't say anything wrong. - No, you said nothing at all. Well, it's a great privilege to be with you boys tonight. And I mean that. - And I can say it in this room. - It's a nice room. You fellows have written lots of songs together. But more than that, you've been friends. That's the most important thing in the world, are friends. - Shall I put some bicarbonate in this? - It wouldn't hurt. You know, you've got a friend, and you've got a friend. And that's what I'd like to see. Friends. Very funny. We'll spot it in our next picture. - Here. - Hey, look at that, huh? Here, drink this. Hey, I was just thinking. The time Harry called Tony Miller. You said, "Mr. Miller, if you back that play... ...you're gonna be the brokest broker that ever stepped on Broadway." - Remember? - Yeah. What play was that? Your play. You wrote it. And your friend got you out of it. And we went up to see him. And when we told you... ...I will never forget the expression on your face... ...as long as I live. Believe me, I'll never forget it. Oh, hey, Bert, that was a long time ago. I think I better get some coffee. Charlie's got the talkers. Just kidding, huh? No, I always meant to tell you about it, Bert... ...but I just never got around to it. I can understand that. What was on your mind, Harry, when you crabbed that deal for me? - What do you think? - I'm asking. Well, I didn't want you to flop. That play wasn't too good, Bert. You decided that. Oh, why not? You're an expert. Now, wait a minute. You're not gonna pull a peeve after all these years. - What do you expect me to do? - All right, I was wrong. I just didn't want you to get hurt. That's very touching. Well, why else would I do it? Whatever the reason, you had a sweet nerve. What do you mean, "whatever the reason"? All I know is I wanted something very much. And now I find out my partner did me out of it. Well, I told you why, I was worried. About me or yourself? Oh, sure. Now I get it. You think I didn't want you to have that play. I was scared the play might click and bust up our partnership... ...and I couldn't lean on you anymore. Is that what you meant? If I believed that, I couldn't be any sorer than I am now. But you do believe it. You must think I needed you pretty badly. You must have thought so. Not that badly. Look, I'm not forgetting anything. I know what I was when I ran into you: A song-plugger. But even without you, I might have gotten somewhere. It's just possible. All by myself. It's not too late to try. Harry. Bert. Come on, it's time to cut the cake. Come on. Everybody's waiting. Harry. Bert. - Come on. - Make a wish. - Make a wish. - Make a wish, come on. Hello, hello. Bert? Marty. Say, some of the boys down here got ahold of a screwy item... ...for tomorrow's issue. Listen: "Kalmar and Ruby split. Songwriting team are calling it quits after a long and successful partnership. Understood Kalmar will devote his time to stories and screenplay writing." Say, will you tell the boys they're crazy? Okay, Bert. Sorry. Print it. Nice tune. - Have you got any lyrics for it? - No. No words. Ever hear from Bert? No. He's writing those scripts. Doing real well, they tell me. You know, Bert's really a smart fella. Oh, that's nice too. That's one of the nicest melodies you've ever written, Harry. It's always been my favorite. It seems You just tiptoe Into all my dreams So I Think of no other one Ever since I've begun Thinking of you It's different from the rest. You must've been very much in love when you wrote this one. Well... You wanna know something? I think I wrote it too soon. - Morning. - Morning, Jess. - Been working all night? - Most of it. There's a review of your picture in here. - Oh, what did they say? - You're a big man this morning. "The story by Bert Kalmar is thoroughly enjoyable. The dialogue neat and deftly turned." - How's that? - Let me see it. I love good notices. Hey, did you see this? They flew to Yuma last night. She's a very nice girl, Bert. Yeah. Well, we didn't have to wire Al Schacht this time, did we? You didn't eat a thing. I wasn't hungry. - Just tired, huh? - Oh, a little bit. You are my lucky star I saw you from afar And so, ladies and gentlemen... ...we bring to a close another issue of The Songwriters' Parade. Tonight's honored guests were Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown. We'll be back again next week to pay tribute once again... ... to the men who write America's songs. At that time we'll be happy to present as our guests... ... Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby. Is that Phil Regan out of his mind or something? I don't know. Whoever told him to announce a thing like that? A personal appearance. - There's nothing so terrible about it. - Nothing so terrible? A radio show with two people who don't talk to each other? - I wanna get that Regan on the phone. - No. You can't do that. - Why not? - Because... If Phil Regan was nice enough to think of you... ...the least you can do is to be there. I'll take that. He ought to know better... ...than to announce a thing like that without checking first. What kind of a business is this? - Kalmar and Ruby, he said. - Hello? - Kalmar and Ruby. - Oh, hello, Eileen. Like we were brothers or something. - Well, I don't know. - That doesn't mean I have to go. - He ought to stop thinking... - How's it going at your house? - Well, hold on. - This will be a great show. Great. How can they do a thing like this? I didn't okay it. Tell him to get another voice because I'm not gonna be there. Bert won't be there either. What do they expect me to do... ...play the piano while Bert makes a microphone disappear? It's a little early to tell yet, Jessie. I know what you mean. Keep your fingers crossed. Who told them to do it? Who put them up to it? - lf they ever find out that we did this... - What kind of routine are we supposed to do? An argument for the benefit of our audience? Look, Eileen, I'll call you back later. We're on the air, boys, shake hands. Come out fighting. Oh, come on, Harry. Ah, this whole thing's silly. I don't like it, Eileen. Oh, I know. In a way it is embarrassing. But after all, Regan was nice enough to think of you. The very least you can do is be there. - Eileen, Harry! - Jessie, how are you? How are you, Eileen? You look wonderful. I'll take your hat. - Hello, Bert. - Hello, Eileen. - Hi. - Hi. - Pull up a stool. - Oh, thanks. Well, it looks like we're stuck with this thing. I guess so. Got any ideas what we might do? I found one of the old routines. It might be okay. That thing we did at the Friars, remember? Sure. Oh, sure. Sure. This is okay. Want to rehearse? Oh, I know the music. You know the words? Yeah, I know the words. Well, I guess we don't have to rehearse. I guess not. Well, I'll see you tomorrow night, I guess. I guess so. Oh, say... I caught your picture the other night. Nice job. It's all right, I guess. I hear you've been knocking out good tunes lately. Oh, I've been kicking it around a little. You got anything? Sure. Sure, I've got one little tune I've been working on. Of course, you won't like it. - What won't I like? - What I got. - I haven't heard it yet. - Okay. - Sounds vaguely familiar. - Well, I told you you wouldn't like it. I never said that. It's a nice tune, a very nice tune. You never got a title for it, huh? No, in fact, never did. There was "La-Da-Dee-Da" and "Beep-Beep-A-Deep." That's about all we got. Let's see. We ought to get something for a tune like that. Play that first part, will you? Oh me, oh my No. That's no good. You know, that's not a bad tune. - I could've been wrong about it. - Well, you usually weren't. Well, let me see. I love you so No, that's that thing we had before. We'll get it. We'll get something. Yeah, we'll get it. Do you want to work on it? We could knock it off this afternoon. - Okay. Let's knock it off. - All right. I can't this afternoon. I just remembered there's a double-header at Wrigley Field. It's not that I wanna go. You see, I promised a fella... - I see. Baseball is more important. - No. No, I'll work with you tonight. All night if you want to. All right, if you want to. No, wait a minute, I can't. I've got a meeting tonight. The magician's club. The magician's club? - Yeah. - You've gotta do tricks, huh? - No, I don't gotta do tricks. - Yeah, you gotta make rabbits disappear. No, I don't have to make rabbits disappear. I'm the president. - Well, hooray! - Yeah, hooray. You should talk. The nation's number one baseball fan. - "Take him out. Take him out." - Now it's my fault. - I was willing to work. - You don't want to work. - You never wanted to work. - What do you mean? Every time I wanna do something, you're catching flies. - Don't talk about me. - I'll talk about you. What about you, that sleight-of-hand stuff? That dangling ropes in the air, pulling cigars out of your ears? - Yeah? - That's important for kids. - For kids? - Yeah, for kids! I better get him out of here. This is what I've been waiting for. Come, sit down. Keep your voice down. I didn't wanna work, he says. What about you? I wouldn't write that song if you begged me. - Begged you? I didn't even ask you. - I guess you just can't help it, Harry. I feel sorry for you. You feel sorry for me? You must think I'm just... I can tell you what I think of you in three little words: You're a dope! "You're a dope." Bert called me three little words, "You're a dope." You are a dope Three little words Three little words It fits. Hey, Bert! Bert! This is my house. Why should I walk out? - You got it, Bert, the title of the song. - What? "Three Little Words." You got it. You better hurry. You might miss the baseball game. Oh, anytime you're ready to go, Eileen. I'm ready. - Bye, Jessie. - Bye, Harry. - Bye, Eileen. - Bye, Jessie. Good evening. We're here tonight to pay tribute to two great pals of mine. I know they've turned out many, many hits together. I'm sure you've whistled their tunes and danced to their tunes... ...but I know you're gonna get a big kick out of meeting them in person tonight. None other than Bert Kalmar and... And Harry Ruby. - Hello, Harry. Bert, how are you? - How are you, Phil? Here they are, ladies and gentlemen, going to sing a medley of their hit tunes. I wanna be in Tennessee In my Dixie paradise An angel's voice I hear I mean my mammy dear And then we wrote... - Who's sorry now? - Who's sorry now? - Who's sorry now? - Who's sorry? - I tried to warn you somehow - I tried to warn you somehow And then came... I wanna be loved by you Just you and nobody else but you I wanna be loved by you alone And then we sat down and wrote... Why is it I spend the day Wake up and end the day Thinking of you? And then we stood up and wrote... So long, Oo-long How long you going to roam? Please don't be too long Oo-long, so long Hurry back home Maybe I'm right And maybe I'm wrong And maybe I'm weak And maybe I'm strong But nevertheless I'm in love with you Maybe I'll win And maybe I'll... Oh, that's enough of that. How would you like to hear a brand-new song? One we just wrote yesterday. Well, not exactly yesterday. As a matter of fact, it took us about 10 years. Phil, if you please? Three little words Oh, what I'd give for That wonderful phrase To hear those Three little words That's all I'd live for The rest of my days And what I feel in my heart They tell sincerely No other words Can tell it half so clearly Three little words Eight little letters Which simply mean I love you Wonderful, Bert, wonderful. Thank you, Harry. Wonderful. Very good. And now, we'll leave you with three little words: let's all dance. Three little words Oh, what I'd give for That wonderful phrase To hear those Three little words - Sorry. - Darling. - It was just wonderful. - Bert, it was wonderful. Harry, I always knew that was a great tune. No other words Can tell it half so clearly Three little words Eight little letters Which simply mean I love you [ENGLISH]
