Hey, girls! What the hell were you doing? I've been waiting 10 minutes. I had to chat for ages with the neighbours - before they gave me the keys. - Hurry up! The toilets on the ground floor don't work. You have to use the ones on the first floor. - Wait, I don't know which one it is! - You want me to help you? - Where's Carine? - She's peeing behind the house She's not like you, little one. - She's not afraid of being stung on the buttocks - Stop it! Come on, hurry up! They sting you in your knickers! Ah good, already! Hallo? - She's still talking to Jerome? - She's been on the phone half an hour. I don't get it. I don't understand the point of talking like that - for hours on the telephone - I'm fed up with it. Make up your mind, OK? We've had enough. We've been waiting for you at least an hour. So, kiss him goodbye and hang up. - Tell her we're going without her - We're going without you! Anyway, it's too late. We won't be able to eat now. We're going! Shit, she'll come along later. You and your guys! So? What's going on? They told us there's a place open over there. We're hurrying there. Everything's about to close. We'll end up at home again with a lousy pizza. OK so, I won't count the weekend in this time. That gives us about 2 days of revising which I'll divide into 3 parts. - We know that. - So now, it's Monday... But there's something that's no good in the mornings. So now what's no good in the mornings? I don't see why we should do MCQs for 4 hours every morning. I never said we'd spend 4 hours doing multiple choice questions each morning. It was a misunderstanding. This girl's obsessed with multiple choice questions. - I don't see why you're saying that. - You are obsessed with MCQs. Couldn't we plan an hour for going to the beach at least? Stop it! But you're horrible. That's enough. All right? We'll just have a vote, it's easiest, or else. - It'll take hours. - We're 4. We're not going to vote. If we don't vote now we'll be another hour. I agree with Carine. The best solution is to vote. That way, it will be sorted out right away. So let's decide what time we'll get up. OK? - Who's for 7 am.? - I'm for 7 am. Who's for 8 am? - Frederique? - 10 am, 10:30, something like that. What do you do in the morning? - Hey, are you out of your mind? - No, I'm not out of my mind. Listen, if that's the way it is, there's only one thing we can do. We have to split the difference, and get up at 7:30 am. But you're sick, my dear! For your information 7:30 am. is still pretty early. - What are you doing? - A shopping list. A shopping list. Put down "mash" too, because I don't know how long this one's been here. Put "rice" as well. Carine, what cleaning products have we left? There's only washing up liquid, otherwise it's all rubbish.. We have to get more of everything. Why are you throwing that away? Aren't the jams any good any more? - With all that mould, I doubt it. - Underneath, they're good. They're full of mould. It'll taste mouldy. You can't know how it tastes if you haven't tasted it. It seems obvious to me. You're not going to eat that rubbish? You're disgusting, my dear! But it's really good. Here! Come on, taste it. You've nothing else to do but scrounge about in the rubbish? I don't even want to taste it. Throw it in there, I beg you. It's not rubbish. There's loads of good things. I'm telling you: you're being wasteful. Wait, if you got nothing else to do we can find you something. - There's lots of things to clean up. - Taste the chocolate. Smell it. - Oh, it stinks! - It stinks? She ate that? She ate that. It's just sick. - Valerie, - Yeah? - Is this jam all right? - No, don't take those. - You have to take the big kilo pots. - The big ones? Is that right? We still haven't got all the yogurts, milk... You have to go and wait your turn at the checkout. Fred and I are going to look for what's missing. Armelle, what about these jams? Look. They're all right, aren't they? No, they're for diabetics. Wait, give it to me. I want that kind. No, I want real sugar with real jam in it. Not stuff for little old people. Hello ladies. Maybe we can give you a hand with those big boxes? You'll never be able to carry them yourselves. - No thanks. It's nice of you. - You'll manage? You're sure? Hello. I'm Jean-Michel. Will you be able to carry all that? No, thanks, it's OK. Hallo, Ladies. Don't move, I'll sort it out. Ladies, hallo. Let me introduce myself: 3615 code Pascal. I came with my friends. We're on holiday, we're a bit bored. You're very charming. We would like to give a party for his birthday. You can't refuse us. All right? We don't give our address just like that to anyone. Listen, stop. That's paranoid. I really don't want to see all the guys in the area showing up at my house. They asked for it like that, to start a conversation. You should have given them some other answer. Invited them to Fontaillac or something like that. Don't worry. They're not going to show up. But you don't know that. If they show up, I don't mind taking care of the one in the red cap. Whoa, he had the face of a ox! I'm not talking about his face, I'm talking about his body. - Come on, he was really lame. - They were all lame. You say that now, but earlier, you were right up front... You were drooling. You couldn't take it any more. Where did you see that? The guy, he had some kind of hard on When he came to speak to you, you turned scarlet. I wasn't scarlet at all, I tell you. So why did you leave your second button open, then? To tease them or what? But yes, how shameful! - You're completely crazy. - Was it to excite them? Hey, this is where we get off. It's going to go wrong. What are you doing? Are you coming or not? - You can see we're busy. - Come on, only for 5 minutes. Right now we have to put all the things away. Oh come on, it's now or never. The weather is super nice. Come. OK, well, we're going. But don't finish! We'll tidy up after. This is just crap. Between Carine who gives our address to the first little flirt, and then Frederique going to the beach... It's not a good start. Hold on, we've only just arrived. Well, I don't want to work in conditions like this. If they think they came here to spend their time at the beach, watching us work and sunbathing, no way. I'm telling you: I'm behind enough as it is. I don't want to do my second year again. Then they'll take away my grant. What will I do then? Anyway, I agree with you. When Carine and Fred come back, we should talk about it with them, so we can make things clear. OK? I'm just saying what I think. Come on, you silly cow! - You're already set up? - Yes. I'll close the door. - All right? Was the water nice? - Very nice, thank you. Okay, so here's the program that we planned for our revisions. We'll start with anatomy. With multiple choice questions every morning 8:30 to 12:30. Afterwards, we'll go on with revision at 1 pm. We thought that a half-hour break would be quite enough. We never said that a half-hour break would be enough. You shouldn't have gone to the beach. Then you would have given your opinion. You dork. So, can I go on? - It's OK? Let's start? - Yes. - Have you seen what time it is? - No. - Why? What time is it? - Don't know. I don't have my watch. It's OK, it's 8:30. - She still hasn't come down? - No. Frankly, is she fucking us around or what? We just have to start work. That'll bring her down. Not a chance. Anyway, I'm not going up to get her. Well, I'll go. No, but it's true. - Pass me my notes, please? - No, I'm not finished with them. What do you mean you're not finished? I'm not finished. I'll be another five minutes. Hang on, you've been doing nothing for one hour. It'll be an hour and five minutes. Can you can pass them to me, please, for two seconds? I'm working, I'm reading. I'm looking at them. Would you pass me my notes, please? Just a second, please. Can you wait? - Well then, go ahead, work. - I am working! But stop looking at me because I can't work if you look at me. - You really are an idiot. - Wait, I'll be 5 minutes. I'll pass them to you after that. You're not going to bother me. You understand all of a sudden, then? Wait! I don't believe it. Did you see what she did? She took the notes just like that. She grabbed them from me. Go to the beach. Thanks, keep your rotten notes. They're blue all over, it's revolting - Well of course - it's ink. - I want to join you. What are you doing? I'm doing lamb chops. What test is that? - Show me! - No! Why don't you want to show me? Show me. What is it? No, I don't want to to show you it, that's all. Are you sick or what? Show it to me, at least. - Why don't you want to show it to me? - It's personal. What do you mean, 'it's personal'? It's a test that I did with Jerome. I don't want you to see it, that's all. Ah, is that it? That's all? That's why you don't me to see? Because you did it with Jerome? Well. Those tests mean nothing, they're useless in Elle. Armelle? Armelle? Are you asleep? No. - Did I wake you up? - No. - What are you doing? I'm doing a relaxation exercise. You put your head on the table, you put your arms like that and then you go blank. It's an exercise they do in Japan in the offices. - To relax. - And that relaxes you? Yeah. Well yeah, I think so. Don't you think so? I don't know. When I'm tired I lie down for five, ten minutes. - You've been working all evening? - Yeah. I say, you're completely tense. - Is that so? - Yes. Relax your shoulders a little. Do you have problems with your memory? No. Well, like everyone else. Then I'm not like everyone. I've worked too hard this year. I'm completely exhausted. I can't fall asleep at night, I don't get up in the morning... It will pass. - Do you think so? - Yeah. So the 26 is the 4 and the 3. And for the 27, the 1, the 4 and the 7 are correct. - The 1, 4 and 7? - Yes. Impossible. - But yes. - That's what I put. Why? Did you put something else? Wait... The cavity... along... The long lateral peroneal is not in the anterior cavity of the leg? You're mixing them up. Impossible. Hold on... We'll check the book. Wait, we'll do that later. We can go on. Yes, because if we check all the answers, we won't finish. Where's the book I gave Frederique? What book? The anatomy book I gave you yesterday afternoon? - Well, I gave it back to you. - Yeah? When? I gave it back to you...I gave it back to you yesterday afternoon. I'm not mad. When did you give it back? Shall we finish correcting the MCQs or what? Wait, we're sorting this book story. We should use this opportunity to take a break. You know how much a book like that costs? In any case, it's not in my things. It costs at least 500 francs. And it's also out of print. Why are you're telling me this.? You want me to pay for it, right? From today on it's very simple: I won't lend you anything again, and you can manage with your own shitty notes. Carine, were you there when I passed the book to Frederique? - I don't know, I didn't notice. - Try to remember. It was in the garden, before we took a break. - I don't remember. - It's not possible. You can't have forgotten. Can you change the subject? - You're annoying everyone with your book story. - I'm not talking to you! What are we eating? Nothing! We're not eating anything until we find my book. - You're completely crazy, poor thing. - It's you, you're completely sick. That's right, I'm the sick one, now. Admit that she's sick, at least. She can't even remember where she put my book. She doesn't want to come. We'll go without her. Armelle! Armelle! - Not yet. - You want to come? No, I've got to work. No point in insisting. She doesn't want to come. We won't be more than an hour. That's what you say. Anyway, I don't want to come. Can we bring back you anything? A waffle, something like that? Or a guy? A big hairy one? That's it, go for a swim. Alright, come on. Work. So I still have the lower limbs to do... Friday, I'll start on biochemistry. Biochemistry pisses me off. Good. Work. And there's no more water. For God's sake... - But see how you are with her? - How? I'm like that. I'm no more aggressive with her than with others. You're no more aggressive with her than with others, true. - Hang on, I'm not aggressive. - She's not aggressive! - You're making me aggressive. - You've got to be joking. Did you hear her tone when she asked me for my book? She asked you for her book normally. - Anyway, she's not ready to see it again. - Why do you say that? - You know where it is? - Yeah. Oh, you bitch! Go back, apologise and give it to her. - Frederique! - Frederique, give her book back! Go on, do it! Like, you got something to say all the same then... You'll see. What's this car? - Armelle's with a guy in the kitchen. - With a guy? Yeah, a tall dark one who looks really stupid. If that's so, maybe that's why she didn't want to come to the beach with us. Hello. Hi. - Do you recognise me? Francis. - Oh yes! Your cousin. Francis Bouillet. - Yes, I recognise you. - Hello. - Carine. - Francis. - Hello - Frederique. Hello, Frederique. So? How've you been doing since last time? Things are going well, but what are you doing here? The other night I went to eat with my parents at your grandmother's... - You remember my parents? - Yeah, vaguely. Anyway, we talked of this and that, and then... She asked if I would repaint the shutters of the house. That was handy, because right now I don't have much money, so... It's pretty good. I'm expecting friends who'll come to pick me up in 2 weeks. She didn't say that we would be here in June? No, she didn't say anything. She really told me nothing. She didn't even say you'd be here, so... She gave me her keys, and that was that. I'm a bit surprised too, you know. I mean...pleasantly surprised. What's this story about shutters? Why does she want to change them? No, it's not to change them. Just to repaint them. But why does she want them painted now? Because the house will be rented out in July. - She's renting the house in July? - In July, yes. And she also gave me some things to do in the house, some joints, the painting has to be redone, check out the plumbing, stuff like that, what. I have the list in the car. I'll show you if you like. Do you think you'll be a long time or not? He doesn't know. I don't know... I don't really know. Three or four days? Maximum. Well, I'll see how's it goes, you know. - Didn't you know we were here? - No I didn't know. Because we came here to work. You might disturb us a bit. Yes I know. That's what Armelle explained to me, but... Then we have our end of year exams in two weeks. In twelve days. It's Wednesday night. Anyway... I don't know, if it bothers you too much... I don't know, we... We can decide something, or we can work it out? Don't you think? I'm not too aware of all this, you know. I'm just telling you what she told me, so... - Good night, Armelle. - Good night. - Aren't you coming upstairs, Valerie? - Yes, yes. I'm coming. In my opinion, she forgot to tell you about it. It's a drag. Why does she need to rent this house now - when there was never any question of it before? I've no idea. - Good night, Carine. - Good night. - Good night, Frederique. - Good night, Francis. I admit it's not very funny. Is it the first time this house is for rent? Yeah, it's the first time. Usually we always come and spend a week or fifteen days. I was going to spend fifteen days in July with my boyfriend. Oh yeah? Yeah, It's not funny It's no joke at all. Well, it doesn't matter. - Right, OK then, Good night. - Good night. - See you tomorrow. - Yeah, see you tomorrow. Valerie, hurry up! Come on, listen. I didn't care and I didn't understand. He began to draw me a diagram with aunts, uncles, cousins, arrows. Shut the door, please, Frederique. Close it... The cousin did her a family tree. Listen to what a hell it's been while you were coming back! He told me preposterous things. He told me bullshit! He's a bullshitter! It's true he's a bit touched. I don't understand why you didn't kick him out. - It's a little tricky. - You think so? He must be fired. You're silly. We don't fire people like that. Do you think he's asleep? Doesn't look like it. Are you settled in? It's OK? Yep, I'm fine. I added a chair to make it longer because it's too short. We're just looking for something, don't worry. I'll turn on the light. - I can't remember where we put them. - What thing is it? It's a big suitcase. In fact, it's like this, black or dark, I don't know. It's in the cupboards, maybe? I don't know how long it's been since we've seen them. Isn't that it? Look. Oh, yeah, that's it Yeah, I think it's... Yeah! Great. Look. - That's it? - Yeah. - Did you find what you were looking for? - Yeah. - Good night. - Good night. - Bye. - Bye. - Is it the right year? - Yeah, it's '81. It should be right. - It's not turning properly, right? - No, it's OK. Do you want me to help you hold it? No, don't touch it! You'll mess it up. All right. Carine, can you turn off the light, please? It's starting. Maybe we'll see what he looked like, then. Nice, very nice. Is it a documentary on Saint-Palais or something? No, but my father made the film. He always starts like this. Ah, that sea! Your father's got Parkinson's? - Hey, we can see the house. - No, we can't see the house. - Yes, see it behind the trees! - No, Valerie. That's me. There, in the green suit. I must have been nine years old. It's funny to see you like that. - You're really sweet. - There's my sister. - She's curvy, your sister. - She's really beautiful, isn't she? - She's changed a lot. - Stop it. She's still beautiful. - She's fat now. She's 20 kilos overweight. - That's nonsense! - She's gained a little weight. - Who's the boy on the left? Look, she's beautiful. She's really beautiful. Yeah. Oh, you're fussy, eh? Ah, there, that's him! - Oh I say. The little guy. - He looks really big-headed. But he's monstrous, this little kid. It doesn't make you blush. - No, I find him really cute. - You think so? - Hey, you're not choosy, eh? - Oh, he's funny. - Oh, he's ugly! - No, he's not ugly. Look, his ears are sticking out his nose is all squashed. It's true, his ears stick out. He's got a nasty face. Oh, he's disgusting! This kid's evil! That's you in the garden. He came on holiday with his parents - and I think he was camping in the garden. - No! Listen, I love him. He's so funny. He makes me laugh. He's so sweet. - Nonsense. - Yes, listen. - Anyway, he's changed a lot. - Yes, his face... Ah, there you are! That's his father. Imagine Francis becoming like his father! But when you see the father, you really understand. Stop it. You're being mean about this kid. He doesn't look nasty there? Look. You knew each other pretty well before? - Oh no, not from behind! And the dog! - But stop it now. He wanted to bugger you or what? Orgy! - Oh no! - No, shit! - But what is this film? - That was the best moment. - Your father's censoring it. - There, that's the end. - And the beach, there. - Oh, I say! Here, it's for you. Did you wake him up? Yes, I went there just now. Have you seen what time it is? We're already ten minutes late. No, but he's going to get up. I went into the living room. He's not getting up at all. He is completely sprawled out and has a good hard on in his bag. - Good morning, girls. - Good morning. - You all right? Did you sleep well? - Yeah, and you? I crashed out. I'm a bit bleary-eyed... Isn't there any coffee? No, we don't in the morning. But there's ground coffee in the cupboard. - OK, let's go? - I'm coming, I'm finishing. Do you want coffee? I'm making some. No, thanks. And what year are you in? The second. - You're moving up to the third? - Yeah. Trying to. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - It seems a big deal, what you're doing. - What we're doing? The books, all that, the pages and the photocop... the photocopies, all that. Looks like a really big deal. There're some great photos too, in the book. - You think so? - Yeah. It's disgusting. I saw scabs on the skin and everything, it's horrible. - Sorry. At breakfast, it's not... - Yes, a bit tough. Look, bread crusts. Sausages, ten of them. That's ten sausages. - Did you buy sausages? - Have you seen the Ricoré? Where do you do your shopping? Because there's lots of cheap deals at the Maxicoop. Like... Danone, petits musclés. - Big cake, and there's compote. - Can't you stop for five minutes? There's dry-cured ham. That's really good. I tried some in Auvergne, it's so good. You really have a one track mind. Can't you talk about anything else? Right. Ah. OK. So... Of the following propositions, which do not apply to the tibia? A: Thirteen angles, three faces and three edges like the femur. B: Does not have a sh...sharp... Does not have a sharp line. Small C: forms the skeleton of the leg with the fibula, outside of which it is situated. Are you listening to me or not? Er... Good. Ah, fucking shitty hinge! I'll bash you with the sledgehammer, you'll see! Did you hurt yourself? No, it's OK. I banged my thumb. Because of that bloody hinge there, look. They're all sealed in the wall and I have to get them out to change them. It's not the same downstairs, the hinges are different. We're going to carry on working in the garden. Aren't you going to eat now? We'll just have an apple or something like that. In fact, we decided it's good if you take this opportunity to move your things from the living room and put them in the small room next to the cellar. That would be better for sleeping. Wait, you're talking about the little room down there? That grubby little hole? - It's not grubby. - I can't even stand up in it, - and it's completely filthy. - Yes, you can stand up in it. It'll be good when you clean it up, like that. Oh, when I've cleaned it up? When I've cleaned it up? Well, it'll only take 5 minutes. 5 minutes? You kidding? You seen the mess it's in? Just vacuum it a little. Shall we do that? - Yeah. - OK. Work hard, eh? Yeah, yeah. I'll clean up, OK. It's not the only thing I have to do. Oh well, OK. Just as I thought. I can't even stand up in here. Shit, that stinks. Instant tidying up, there you go. Damn, these shutters are so rusty, I can't open them. - Hey, girls, how about a coffee now? - Why, are you making it? - Well, yeah. - Then, I'd like one. - And you, Carine, you want one? - - Me too, please. I'd like one. Valerie! Armelle! Do you want some coffee? If I do, will you bring it to my room? Well, yeah. Then I don't want one. So. One, two, three coffees. Maybe you'd like it with milk? - No thanks. - No. - You don't want anything? - No. - OK. See that? I put it on high speed. I put it on high speed. That's pretty smart, isn't it? There's 2 speeds. Look. It's like on baby's bottles. A low and a high speed. Small so the baby drinks less fast, and then a big one so he drinks faster. Here it's the same. A small one to make the coffee stronger - and a big one to... - It's OK thanks. I get it. Did your mother make a mistake with the speed on your bottle? Watch out, heat ahead! - Can I put it here? - Yes, go ahead. - Coffee? - Yes. - Here. Coffee? - Yes. OK. So what shall I have? I'll have a coffee. Anyway, you're brave. Working in such weather... We'd would be better at the beach. How many years of study do you still have? It depends on whether we specialise or not. Usually a minimum of eight years. Eight years is a long time, anyway. I mean, you have to be able to... I mean you have to be materially secure, especially from the point of view of the readies, eh. That said, a doctor, it must still feel pretty good, right? It varies. Yes, it varies... But when you have a good level... When you have a good level of general studies, you still have to work a lot, or then you can... All the same, you have to work hard, you know. Carine, it's for you. It's your sister. I'll get it. It can't be easy, though. Are you working on maths? It's anatomy, isn't it? You, do you want to specialise or what? I'm doing something quite difficult. Do you mind leaving me in peace? Don't you have anything else to do? No, I'm having a little break. Five minutes. Girls! How about celebrating my new pad? And I found a bottle of plonk. - Is it still good? - Well yeah, I think so. It looks really old, that thing. I think it's too old to be good. Would you like to celebrate my new pad? I put in some little lights, chairs and everything, it's really cool. What are you offering us? A visit to your attic? No? You aren't interested? Because... I found a bottle of Château Cheval Blanc 1970. Where did you find that? In the cellar. There's lots more. Huh? Er... is someone not eating? Yes, we're all eating. Why have you only set 4 places? - Where are you eating? - Er, I don't know. What the hell is he doing? I don't know, but it's really annoying. For some time now... I haven't been able to work. Listen, Valerie, please say something to him. Tell him to stop, because I can't take it any more. Francis! What? Are you going to sand all the shutters like that? Well, yeah. No, but are you going to sand them all afternoon? Well, yeah. Do you have to do this now? Yes, I have to because I must sand them before painting them. Couldn't you do it somewhere else? No, is he doing it on purpose, or what? - You going upstairs? - He'll be at least 3 hours getting rid of these things, so I'm off. What a pain in the arse he is! What's the matter with her? - We can't do anything, we can't work. - Oh, yes? - You want me to go behind the house? - Yes, of course. Well, OK, you should have said. I'll get this stuff out of here then I'll go behind the house. - All right. - That way I won't bother you. - What is it? - It's Francis. Sorry to disturb you. - I would like to know if... - What do you want to know? I want to know if... I mean, just now, when I was sanding in the garden... And actually, I was making a noise, and had to stop. I mean, the girls and all that. So I would like to use this break to take your shutter off. Well, at least to examine it, because I haven't looked at it. You're not coming into my room. I'm in the middle of working. - No, but just for two minutes. - Listen. I'm in middle of working, it's very hard. If you don't know what to do, - the weather's lovely, go to the beach. - Really, no. I can't. Sorry. Yeah, OK. OK, well... OK. It's hot, eh? - Don't you want to try the water? - What? Don't you want to try the water? No. Oh. - You don't want to come swimming with me, then? - No I don't want to. Well, all right... too bad. - You don't mind if I put my things there? - No, it's all right. Well, I'm going in. - Hey, you're here? - Yes and you, what are you doing here? Can't you tell? I'm all wet. I went swimming. - You don't want to swim, then? - No. We still don't, thanks. - Why? Do you want to go back? - Well yeah, if you want, yes. If you want to go, I would like to go with you. The water's good, you know. It's just a little bit cold when you get out. If it's as good as that, you should have stayed there. You're not going for a swim, then? I'm certain. Maybe we don't really want to go swimming with you, see? - Why? - I dunno. You don't have a swimsuit other than that one? - What? - It doesn't look very up to date. It's the kind of model we would find more in the trade. Can you still find that kind of thing? No, but where did you buy it? Isn't it obvious? No? I bought it from an antique dealer, look. Can't you see? And he also gave me a small discount on it. because there were some rust stains behind. OK, 'bye, girls. I'll crush it. She's not there any more. - Valerie? - What? Can I speak to you for 5 minutes? - Now? - Yeah. - What is it? - I wanted to tell you... I'm going to the shops tomorrow because I have to buy hinges. I've taken almost all of them off. If I don't buy more, I won't be able to put the shutters back up. - So tomorrow, I'm doing some shopping. - And so? - I won't be here tomorrow morning, you see. - I don't understand. - I wanted to know if that would bother you. - Oh, no! It doesn't bother us at all. Is that all you wanted to tell me? Uh... well yeah. If you want I can do your shopping. If you need some stuff... Oh, all right. Girls, do you need something? Francis is going shopping tomorrow. - No. - I'm fine thanks. - So, no. - No? Well, never mind. - Well, good night, eh? - OK. - Sweet dreams. - Yes, you too. Good night. - Good night, Francis. - Sleep well. - Good night, Francis. - Listen to the girl. I didn't see him go. Quiet, eh? OK? Carine? Oh, it's you. You scared me. What are you doing like that in the dark? Nothing. Did they kick you out? No, no, not at all, no. I was taking the air, - before going to sleep. - Oh yeah? Me too, but I'm going up to bed. Because I am a bit tired. You don't want to chat a little bit? Yeah? What do you want to talk about? I dunno...of this and that. Of this and that? Listen, can we do it tomorrow? I'm really tired. Me too, I'm a bit tired, and I have to work tomorrow. I've got a lot on my plate, as they say. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. - 'Night. - Are you enjoying tonight? Yes, it's nice weather. - It's mild, isn't it. - Yes, yes. No, it's true, the weather's good. It's fine. OK, I'm going. See you tomorrow. Francis, are you OK? - But what's wrong with you? - Nothing, nothing. I like you, you see. That's all. Oh, yeah? Me, I don't really fancy you. I mean...I don't fancy you much. Well...fine. See you tomorrow. You must ask the question that we asked people. We asked them if they usually go away... I don't care. I want to know what Carine thinks. No! You have to ask the question as it was written. - 18% is huge. - What numbers are these? Nothing. It's an survey made about holidays. 18% of those questioned, said they had already taken their holidays separately, 42% would like to be able to, and often. Frederique finds that 18% isn't a lot. Look around you, how people live, how couples function. It's completely normal. That sucks. When you really love each other, you go on holiday together, not each your own way. Not so. You can love someone a lot and want to have other encounters. You have a completely horrible idea of love. You don't understand there may be a difference between loving someone and making love with them. That's crap! You're crazy. You are not going to yell at each other over this, are you? Stop it. To tell the truth, I don't give a shit about those magazines... If I follow your reasoning, we could say that Jerome is not in love with you either. - Why do you say that? - You never go on holiday together. Of course we have, we already went on holiday together. Oh yes? You spent your holidays together last summer? That's got nothing to do with it. Last summer, neither or us could. This summer, we're spending July together. So you say. - What do you mean, 'So you say'? - We'll talk about it later . You're really dishonest, it's incredible. It's not even worth discussing with you. - Well, who's dishonest now? - You're really being a pain. - What? - I said 'you're a pain'. But you always agree with Valerie. I don't see why you said that to her.. Really I don't. You're not going to get started too? - Shh! - What? Did you hear something? No? - Why? You think there's someone? - I don't know. No? It's not possible! Is he going to start up that old crate, or what? It's not too soon, I say. Valerie, I need to talk to you about your cousin, because it's no longer possible, it can't go on. What's the matter? Since he's been here, I'm completely unable to work. Completely. So either you make him leave, or I will leave. You know I can't fire him like that. It's your house. You can fire him if you want. I mean, you're in your home. - Did you find my fags? - Yes. I brought you 3 packs. - So you won't send me out to get them every 2 hours. - Great. - Has the other idiot come back yet? - No, not yet. - That's strange. What time is it? - It's 3.10. I hope he hasn't had an accident. With his old crate, that wouldn't surprise me. - Was he bringing the food? - Yes, it's him. Good, there he is. What was he doing? He took his time. He told me why, but I didn't understand. I think he had a hard time finding the parts he needed. And then I went to the other shop. There I waited 20 minutes, for a little man to come and serve me, you see? You follow? So I went from one to the other and wasted at least 10 minutes, so it took the whole morning. The other guy came 20 minutes later and then said "No, no". I was fuming. He showed me his hinges. I said, "No, they're not the right ones, "I'm sorry." He said "Sir, these are the hinges that I usually sell, "your hinges are a bit strange." I said: "But these are the hinges I need." "They're long hinges for normal shutters, for a house." Finally I asked him how much they cost, he told me 17 francs each. Can you imagine? I took the hinges he offered me, so I'll have to to change them all. The problem, is that I paid with my own money. I have to see about it with grandmother. Hey, girls! It's ready. Come! Come and eat! Come and eat kebabs! Come! What are you doing hanging about on the stairs? I've been calling you for an hour. Didn't you hear me?? We were discussing something. Something which we need to talk to you about, by the way. Is that right? What do you want to talk to me about? I suppose you've noticed that we work quite hard? We don't get out of the place much, and we would like to take advantage of Sunday... to go for a walk, take our mind off things. Is that right? Tomorrow? Yeah, tomorrow. The thing is, as you see, we don't have a car. So we would like to know if you can lend us yours. - Mine? - Is that a hassle? A little bit, yeah. Because it is not quite new. And you have to know how to drive it. We'll take great care. We'll be very careful. - I swear to you. - Yeah... In fact, I wanted to take a break tomorrow. I wanted to stop a bit, have some fresh air, go for a swim and all that, and... What would be simplest, is that I come with you. That way, I can drive. Also, I know some great spots in the area. We could walk in the Médoc, for example. We'll take the car, go on the ferry, and then take a walk in the Médoc. We'll cross over. It could be nice. I'm sure you will like it. - Shall we accept? - Huh? You can change to fourth, if you want. There, turn right at the cross. - Right? - At the cross, that way. Here. Go easy with the gearbox, because it's a bit fragile. This car's done at least 150,000 km. Yeah, OK, I'm doing the best I can. No, but I say that... Still, I think you drive well. Especially for a woman. - Hey! - Macho! - What a guy, Francis! - No, it's just to kid around. Here, take a left there. At the little path there. - Will it be much longer? - No, we're almost there. We're starting to get a bit tired here. It's not far, it's just over there behind a dune. - Did you say there was a beach? - Yeah, there's a beach. - Well, let's say at low tide, there's sand... What, at low tide? - But then the sea is miles away. - No! We didn't drive an hour and a half just to find rocks! Wait until we get there. It's a really great place. There's really no one. No one knows this place. The last time I saw people there was three years ago, Some Dutch people bathing nude. So maybe we can all bathe in the nude, then. I don't know, you know, it's not really a day to... to do that. - It's here? - Yeah. - It looks crappy! - What? - It's horrible. - No! You have to go over to the other side. There's a fantastic view the other side. Come on, hurry up! I like watching the girls who walk on the beach When they take off their clothes and pretend to be good Have you already eaten? - No, not yet. - Not yet? - But it's late. Are you hungry? - No. - We were waiting for you to come home. - That's nice, because I'm hungry. - Well, maybe I'll prepare something. - Yeah? - I'll lay the table. - OK. So... What should I make? It's nice to see you eating like this. Looks like you were hungry. A little, yeah. Yeah, that seems normal, considering the time. It's true that we usually eat earlier. Note that I was hungry too because... walking makes you famished. - You want some? - Mm. You like my omelette? You're right, it's good. - Frederique? - Yes. - You like it? Then say so. There, I've said it: I like it. Here. Note that it's good that you like it, because... as a matter of fact, I spat in it. I can't believe it. Is that a joke? - It's a great joke. - If you did, that's really disgusting. - Are you kidding or what? - Yes, that's right, I'm kidding. - But are you insane? - You're really disgusting! - I thought it would make you laugh. - Is that a joke? No, it's not a joke. Yes, it's a joke, you know. A little joke. But you're insane, you're completely crazy. No, I'm not, I just wanted to make a joke. No one's laughing at your joke, my friend. You halfwit. Oh well. I thought it would make you laugh. Are you a jerk? You're a jerk. That's it. Yeah, I'm completely crazy, that's it. It's foul. There's no other word. Well, too bad, since it's not funny. And then I wanted to say; about the table, it would be nice if you cleared it up, since I made the omelette, right? OK? You don't mind, I hope? Good night, eh. 'Night, get out of here. Little shit. Do you think he really did it? Oh, I don't know. I wouldn't be surprised if he did. Armelle? Yeah? Are you there? Are you all right? - What's the matter? - I wanted to vomit, - but I can't. - Have you tried? Yes I've tried, but nothing came out. - Did you put your fingers down your throat? - Yes. It was disgusting. Or you can take a good hot bath. It's nice of you, but no, it'll get better. Thank you. Oh yeah, shit. Well, OK. What's the matter with the other crazy person? She's just a bit upset. She had a problem with Francis. She came down and he was in the living room. I think he told her to fuck off. - Where is he? - No idea. We haven't seen him. He can't be far away. What are you doing this morning? Aren't we going to work in the living room? - You won't? - No. No, not me. All right. - Hey, Carine. - Yes? What did you get for exercise 14? This one. Me, I got that, see. - But I got the same, good. It's the same thing. - Ah, great. So what am I going to eat? Damn, there's nothing here. - Girlie yogurts. - Francis? Hey, we were really worried. We wondered where you were. Oh yeah? That's nice. Did you get the parts you needed? No, I called up. And so? So, they haven't received them yet. And when will they receive them? - They don't know. - Oh? And you then, you'll have to stay...until when? I don't know. I'll have to phone them again. - Uh, we... - What we said together with Valerie, is that what might be better for you and for us, is... rather than being in the living room, for example, you can take my room, and I would go with Valerie in hers. That's it yeah. Why not in the toilet or the bathroom too, while you're at it? What are you doing with all that stuff? I'm putting Francis's things in Carine's room. - What are you doing, Carine? - Moving into Valerie's room. You'll sleep in the same room? We thought it better so he won't be in the living room, - any more, taking over everything. - OK And where's Frederique? - I think Frederique's gone for a walk. - She has. I mean yes, that's cool. So, there you go. OK. I was sure of it. 'Bye. There, you took the abscissa of your angle to a reference which is fixed. And the other two coordinates, in which the one in motion. So it's as if you have one foot on the ground, the other on a conveyor belt. - Are you listening to me? - No, not really. Tell me, wouldn't you like us to go back to Paris? No, why? Because we're all working in our own corners, so it's pointless. Because of this, I prefer to go back to Paris, that way, I'll be more calm. Won't you wait till the end of the week? No, we're not doing anything. We work in awful conditions. - You're exaggerating. - And I can't concentrate. I don't know what I'm doing.. I can't do it. In addition, it's a bad atmosphere. And then I don't find it correct that you installed him in the room just down from me without asking my opinion. Is that the problem? Because we put him up here? - No it's not that. - Let's go and talk about it with the others No that's not it. Anyway, it's done. - Come on, let's talk to the others. - No. What I wanted to say, is that I found the principle incorrect. - You're back? - Yeah. - Is there anything to eat? - No, there's nothing. We're going shopping with Valerie. You'll come? - No, I'm not here tonight. - You won't eat here? No, I won't even eat because I met two guys who invited me to a party, and I think I'll go. - You want to come? - No. You should, it would take your mind off things. - No I don't want to. - Come, let's have a good laugh. No, I promise you, I prefer to stay here. All right. What about your revision, then? - My revision? - Yeah. If you knew how I don't give a fuck. I've wasted enough time like this. I wonder if I'm going to drop everything. At least pass the exam. What use is it to pass the exam? For two years I'm doing things that don't interest me at all. What we're doing at the moment is Chinese, you know? I don't want at all to go on another 5, 6 years, to get pissed off like that, to miss out on everything. - But what's wrong with you all of a sudden? - I dunno... Everything pisses me off, annoys me, it makes me very unhappy. - What's going on? - Nothing. Nothing's going on. Something's going on. You've got those sorts of faces. What sort of faces? Gloomy faces. Has something happened? What do you want to happen? I don't know. It's not for me to tell you. Nothing's happened, we're telling you. I can see that something's happened. - We've said that nothing's happened! - Why are you so aggressive? I'm not aggressive. You're pissing us off with your questions. But you're really aggressive! What's the matter with her? - Did I say something wrong? - No. It's nothing, Valerie. It's OK. - Has something happened to her? - No, no! Really, stop it. - I'm hungry. - Huh? - I'm hungry. - Oh, yes? Me too. - But what's this minibus doing here? - I dunno. We have visitors. Oh no, it can't be true! - Oh well, there you go. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - How are you ...? - Fine. - What's going on? - Isn't it obvious? I'm off. - You're off right now? - Well yeah, right now, yeah. - But the shutters? - What about the shutters? What do we do with the shutters? The shutters, I've no idea. We'll see about it later... You're not leaving like that! Tell us where you're going so we can reach you. Reach me? What for? I really don't know. You never know. Oh yeah. If it's to send me postcards, it's really not worth it. It's for grandmother. In case she asks. Grandmother! Wait, girls. I'm coming in a moment. I have to talk a couple of minutes with Valerie. Listen, I believe that you haven't understood well. I don't want you to know where we're going, OK? I want us to mind our own business, be relaxed, and I have no wish, no wish at all that you, especially you, know where we're going. You understand that? OK? Me, what I want is to be left alone in peace - Do you get it? - OK. Francis, get a move on, will you? OK, I'm coming. 'Bye 'Bye Come on, let's go. - Is she your girlfriend? - No, my cousin. I kid you not. - She's cute. - You kidding? You want me to leave you the keys? - No, it's OK. - As to that, good luck. So, on our way! Go up there. Let's get out of here! Go, go! So, that's it. He left everything here. We'll have to put everything away. On top of that, these shutters are really heavy. What parts did he want to change on them? I don't know, is it this? - No, it's not that. - I don't know. - It must be this, he took it off. - Did he put anything away? - No. Nothing at all. - Nothing. For 2 hours he made a mess in the house, there were... - Did you see the naked girls? - Naked girls? There were naked girls with him. They made a big mess, everywhere for 2 hours. - Really naked? - Oh yeah, that's right. They weren't half naked. They were naked, and that's that. - And there's water everywhere. - What's that now? - It's all right, it's for me. Goodbye! - Goodbye! Did you see that Frederique didn't come home? I went to her room. Her bed wasn't even slept in. Yeah. What's going on? Armelle has decided to go back to Paris. Really? You want to go back now? I mean, today? I looked at the timetables. There's a train at 11 am. There's also no point in making that long face. - It's not a drama. - Maybe you prefer us to shut up? If I decide to return to Paris, it's my problem, not yours. It was I who wanted to come here, even if from the start I didn't think it was a very good idea. But I didn't force anyone. If you didn't want to come, - you shouldn't have come. - I never said that you forced me. If I invited you here, it was to have a nice time. Admit anyhow that you and I, are not quite in the same situation. - What do you mean? - Don't you see what I mean? No. Say it more clearly. I just want to say that from the marks you had in February, you're almost certain to pass to the 3rd year. - And so? - And so? We don't have the same motivations. That's all. But that's wrong? You're completely crazy. Surely you won't blame us for... having good grades in February? No, it's not at all what I mean. It's just that I have to work like crazy, Whereas you can take it easy. You're completely paranoid. You're completely crazy. Jerome! Hey, hey. - All right? - Yes. What are you doing here? I came to see you. - Like that? - Yes, I wanted be sure you're working hard. - Is the exam soon? - Six days. - Not too scared? You're OK? - Yes. I am afraid. So you've come like this without warning? No, but wait. Wait, something great happened to me. Imagine that when arriving at Trinity last night, we came completely by chance on a guy who wanted 2 crew members to sail a boat to the West Indies. Isn't that great? It's the kind of opportunity you can't miss. The only problem is that we have to be there in mid-July, so we must leave as soon as possible. That's the problem. But when are you leaving? We're leaving tomorrow morning. So I'm off to Paris, I'll return the car to my mother and take the last TGV, and early in the morning, on our way to the West Indies. On top of that you would see the boat, it's the one that Malinowski used on the Route du Rhum in 78. Don't you see? It's right on the tip of my tongue. A ULDB. - A what? - A ULDB: ultra light displacement boat. Oh my, I'm tired. I went to bed at 2 am. and I was wasted on the road. Is there some coffee to drink? - Yes, I'll get you some. - Thanks, that's nice of you. What's its name? Anyway, it's a great boat. Really brilliant. With a name like that. Tell me, are you going back to Paris right away? Yes, I'll have my coffee and go. Could I go with you? Have you finished your revision? No, not really, but I've something super important to do in Paris. All right. It's no problem. We'll have to rearrange things a bit in the car. We'll take the sails out and put them on the roof. Can you do it? - Yes. - Thanks. We left in a big hurry this morning. - Isn't Fred here? - No, she's not here this morning. Oh, that's a shame. I would have liked to see her. - Pasty face! - Yes, I'm still pale. - Haven't you been in the sun? - We didn't come for that, Jerome - We came to work. - You're really serious, eh? Hey, hold on. Wait, we'll take them out through the back. Oh dear... You're going to damage them like that. Pass them to me... No, please pass them through the back. - They're plastic, I won't damage them. - No, They're Kevlar. It tears. - Are you making the coffee? - Yes. - Do you want me to help you? - No, it's fine, thanks. Armelle is going to take advantage of Jerome's car to go to Paris. And you? I am staying. No? I don't know, do what you like. You decide, Valerie. What do you prefer? I think that... I think I prefer be all alone. OK. I'll go, then. All right? Jerome, would you have a place for me in the car, to return to Paris? It'll be a bit of a squeeze, yes. There's no problem. You've packed your bags, at least? No, but I'll go and do it. I'll be about five minutes. Why do they all want to go back to Paris right away? Eh? What's going on? What's wrong? You know I don't like it when you make a face like that? Eh? Did you hear me? What would you have liked? You would have liked me to let you know sooner, right? So what is it? How long does a crossing take? I don't know, it depends on the weather. If there's wind, it can take 3 weeks. We can be there between the 15th and the 18th. But there's less wind in summer, isn't there? It depends on the summer. Either way, I'll be in Paris no later than the 25th. And you start your course on 1st of August? So we won't see each other? But yes, we'll see each other. We may not see each other as long as we had planned, but... we'll see each other anyway. Since we'll have a good week at the end of July. Then we have all our lives in front of us. Good. What the hell are the girls up to? Haven't you finished? Yes. Well, almost. - Can I give you a hand? - No, it's OK. I don't want to be in a rush. I feel I'm going to forget a lot of things. Aren't you leaving any more? - Yes? - Yes, come on. Let's go. Can you pass me my books? There's Bébègue. Come on, give us a kiss! Bébègue... One crappy thing, another crappy thing... If I had known that you would react so badly, I would never have accepted this crossing. I can always tell him that I'm not going any more, but it's complicated. They're boarding tomorrow morning. And then I committed myself to this guy. I hate not keeping my promises. I mean, it's up to you. You decide. If you want me to stay, I'll stay. I'll call him and that's that, no more complicated than that. - No, it's not necessary. - Are you really sure? Because I wouldn't want you to make a long face like that afterwards. To blame me for having abandoned you. Promise me that you won't make a face like that any more? Yes. Better than that. I promise. That's it, then. Thank you. Let's go. We're off. You'll be all right? What do you think you'll do? Will you stay here until Monday? I don't know, no. I think I'll go home sooner. Anyway I'm going to wait till Fred comes home and then we'll see. Anyway, see you Monday at the latest. OK, let's go. Who's going in front? - Me, I'll go in front. - Good. I call you when I arrive in Paris, OK? Then if I have time I'll call you tomorrow morning. I'll be in Paris as soon as possible, I promise you. I'll miss you. Ciao. Alright, come on. Quick. Good. I have to go. I don't like us leaving each other like this. - What would you like? - I don't know. That we don't leave each other. It went quickly, didn't it? You think so? Don't you? Yes, yes. - OK. - Do you want to come in and have breakfast? - No I can't. I have to go. - Come on... - We'll work it out. - Come on... - No. - When will we see each other again? Tonight, I can't. I have to do something. - And tomorrow? - Tomorrow? I don't know. It depends. - You'll call me? - Yes, I'll call you. - You have my number? - The one here? - Yes. - You gave me it. I must have it. I'll leave you my address in Paris and my phone number. I don't go to Paris very often. But OK. - You never know. - Yes. You never know. Thanks. If you want to find me, I'm nearly every night at the cafe where you saw me the other day. See you soon. You'll call me, eh? Yes, I'll call you. - Really? - Mm-hm. You can also come by. All right. - Well. - Well. See you soon. See you soon. Valerie? Did you sleep on the couch? I fell asleep. And the others, where are they? They left. What do you mean, they left? They went back to Paris with Jerome. Jerome came by? And you, you stayed all alone? But I would have come back sooner if I had known. No, but I'm going to work... So you saw Jerome? That's great. You're happy? Oh yeah, of course... Well, that's great. - It was... - Actually, I... - Go ahead. - No, you. - You start. - Are you sure? It was... I don't know what to say. I met a guy whom I really like, but... But, but... he just brought me home, and that's it. I don't know if I'll see him again. Why do you say that? Well... Well, I don't know. I don't have his phone number. I was stupid, I didn't dare ask. I was afraid that... That he wouldn't want to give it to me, or that he'd give me a false number, or that... Maybe I was afraid of showing him that I'm attached to him. I've had enough, you see? It's the first time that I've met a guy that I like, with whom I want to go further. You see, you, you're with Jerome, and sometimes I tell myself that... it's really good. You've been with a guy for a long time. It's true that it's scary, but... and then at the same time... it's true that it must be good to have someone you can count on. Who thinks of you all the time, and you can think of him, like that. Sometimes I feel that it will never happen to me. You know, you're wrong. - I'm sure he'll call you and you'll see each other again. - You think so? But of course, it's obvious. Why do you tell yourself he won't call you back? I don't know. You don't trust people enough. You know, you have to trust people. Ah, but it's hard. Yes, but you have to... you have to trust them. - He'll never call me back. - Yes he will! - He'll call you back, for sure. - You think so? Did you go upstairs? Did we forget anything? No I don't think so. I checked. - OK, well we can leave. - Yeah. There's the taxi waiting. OK. Hello. Hello. Hello. - Hi. - Everything all right? So what are you doing? Are you leaving? - Hi. - Yes, we're going back to Paris. And you, you... Well yes, I came back... I came back, yeah... I came back, because... That's it.
