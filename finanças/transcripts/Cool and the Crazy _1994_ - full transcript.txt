Did Michael ever get home last night? Yeah. He'll never make you again, huh? Joannie, please. Sex is a very private affair. Not mine. Are you sure your husband wouldn't mind? Who's talking Bobby? Ohh. Listen, Roslyn, I've been thinking. After what I just heard, you were not thinking. Come on, come on. This is serious. This is our lives, not some dress rehearsal. I'm tired of being some slave. I spent my life watching my mother cook and clean. Never leave the house, never leave the Valley. She died looking a hundred. She was only 45. She started out like us... love in Hollywood High. Next thing, there's no money, no love, nothing. She raised all of us. So what? She broke her ass like a Mexican maid. Every two weeks, she'd scrape together a few pennies... for a hair set and wash... reading her Hollywood magazines for her high... on Hollywood Boulevard next to the studios. Big deal. You 're having an affair, aren't you? We have to live before we die. We're kids playing mothers to kids. And that includes our so-called husbands. Joannie... OK. His name is Frankie. I don't know if I can handle this. Giving up already, Michael? I got to go. It's Roslyn's night out. She plays bingo, and I'm real late now. How's it going over in Burbank with you guys? It got real exciting one night. Sullivan had Presley on. It could be worse... I guess. Well, Michael, hardly any of my friends... probably none... were married at 18... and had a kid at 19. That's got to be hard. You live with those sick beatniks in Venice. Most of my friends who grew up with me are married. That's how we all became men. We're not sick. We're just horny. Ahem. Maybe I'll come and visit you one day... if you promise me that you won't play that record. You don't like Chet Baker? I don 't understand it. It has no beat. How do you dance to it? Try listening to the feelings, Michael. How's the design coming? What's going on, Michael, Lorraine? There's no overtime allowed. This is a new division... and we don't know if it's going anywhere yet. No one's charging any overtime, Bill. The budget gives us no time... so we're doing it on our own time. I guess that's why we hired you, Michael. ♪ Pretty baby. You got me movin ' ♪ ♪ Honey. Honey. Well. Ain 't that groovin ' ♪ ♪ Fillin ' up my hesitation... ♪ Hello? Is he home yet?

That's what it means. It also means you 'll be home later than you are now. You 'll be more tired than you are now. And maybe I'll have another baby... so that I can work harder than I do now. Michael, I will never work in that malt shop again. We could have our own garage one day, Roslyn. Oh. Oh, isn't that great? Would you let me pump gas once in a while, Michael? Get a little vacation? You could wink at me. I don't know what to do! I know. Michael, I thought when we got married... and had our own apartment... we could do whatever we wanted. All that freedom. lt'd be so fun. What's wrong with you? - What do you mean? - I'm just having fun. Get a piece of cake and shut up. We're here to have fun. I like this place. It's a great malt shop. This ain't no malt shop. Hi, Joey. This is Roslyn. Roslyn. Hi. Joannie, you lied. Hi. I'm Frankie. Hi. That's over. What do you say we go for a ride? - Great idea. - Why? I don't know. I got a good radio. This is crazy. I'm sorry. This is a big mistake. I'm married, Joey. I'm going home. - Great. I'll drive you. - No, thank you. It was nice to meet you, but I'll take the bus. Sorry, guys. She don't know what she wants. And that's what makes her interesting. Ain't you need a ride somewhere? Hey, pretty lady, where you going? We can take you there. What's the matter? You don't like us? Afternoon, gentlemen. Roslyn, this isn't such a good place to hang around in. Sometimes, the buses never show. Let me give you a lift? Thanks.

You think I'm funny, Joannie? Yeah. You 're just like Jackie Gleason. Roslyn? - Real funny. - Ros. - Come on, Joannie. - Bye. Ros. I got to go to work. Take care of it. Oh, my God, this is so crazy. I'm so scared. This is nuts. You can't let them think you 're a kid. - Just act cool. - OK, I got it. Hello? I' m going to take her clothes off real slow... till she's begging for it. And then I' m only going to give it to her... when she admits that you 're a piece of shit... Their job is simply this... Where you been, lover man? Calling Roslyn's husband. What for? Did you say you 're sorry? Crazy, beat it. You 're too young for this. Aw. Whoo! Ha ha! If he finds that pig... in the bathtub. We'll both be bacon. Where the hell are they? Oh, Linda, now... Hank said it was just for a couple of hours... and Eddie's not due back until after 5:00. Linda. I' m home! Quick. Get in the shower! It's that pig. - Hold this. - OK. Shh. OK. Fix your skirt. Hi, Michael. Is everything OK, Michael? Did Little Mike go to sleep on time? How'd you get home? By bus, Michael. I was looking for you. Y ou didn 't get off that bus. If I didn't get off the bus, how the hell did I get home? That's what I'm asking you! OK, Daddy, I got off the bus... a block away from Isabel's shop window... and I was looking at a dress... Joannie, too, right? Yes, Michael, Joannie, too. Michael, what am I supposed to do? Stand out there all by myself at night? It's dark. Michael, I can't help it if you don't trust me. If I was going to cheat... I wouldn't bring my best friend to watch. Here comes the old ball and chain. O h. for Christ's sake. Iook at this. Yo, farm boy! You could spend one goddamn night at home. What do you need a wife for... if you just hang out with the field hands? Baby, what are you doing? What is this? Hoo hoo! Listen, playboy, I'll tell you what. Why don't I quit my job, and you go look for one... and then I can ride around in this thing... all day and all night looking for action. Oh, yeah? You think you could do that? We're just killing time here. - It's no big deal! - Just killing time. Yeah, and this ain't no way to speak to me! Not here! Not in front of my friends! That's no way to speak to a lady. Whoo! I'll be damned. Look what we have here. Pretty boys. Ha ha ha! I'll give you boys a running start. - What do you mean? - Come on! Heh heh! Go! Whoo! Whoo! - East Coast shit. - Ha ha! I'll see you later, baby. Joey. You really do have a way with women, don't you? So gentle, so perfect. Little do they know what I know. - What do you know? - What your mother knows. - What's that? - You 're crazy. Shit, I know that. Well, good. Aren't you going to do anything about it? - Like what? - Like fix it? Well, if I fix it... what am I going to do with the rest of my day? Yeah. What can I say? She loves me. So, there she is, the leader of the pack. Hey, Joannie, what's new? What could be new, you know? Can't wait for this kid to grow up already. Well, how's Bobby? Working hard as usual. What's new with you? Nothing much. Except I'm sure you heard about me and Roslyn. No. What do you mean? You 're her best friend. She didn't tell you? It's strictly between you and your wife. It's none of my business. We all grew up together. I thought we were close enough for a heart-to-heart talk. Why don't you buy her an ankle chain? What kind of bullshit line is that, Joannie? Michael, Roslyn hasn't told me anything. I think she's cheating on me. I want to know what's going on with you two. What the hell did you say? Are you accusing me of cheating on Bobby? Are you calling me a whore, you son of a bitch? Listen, Michael... you 're a fool. You 're lucky to have a girl like Roslyn love you... and you accuse her of cheating on you. Roslyn loves you. She always tells me that. What's wrong? Nothing. Why is everyone so quiet? I don't know. Would you please walk me to the supermarket? Sure... if that's OK with Michael. Sure.

Somebody call the goddamned police. Huh? I'll prove it. You 're covering for Joannie, right? Right? Why don't you tell him, Roslyn? Is Michael telling the truth, Roslyn? I'm sorry, Bobby. You go talk to your wife. Shh. Ahh! Take it easy, son. It's not our fault. I'm really sorry I didn't trust you, Roslyn. I'm really happy this is all over with. There is something wrong with Joannie.

I don't want you hanging out with her anymore. Why not? She hasn't done nothing wrong. What? Michael, you have caused a lot of trouble for Joannie. Yeah, you caused a lot of trouble for Joannie.

How do you reckon, Frankie? I saw them together downtown last night at the movies. Just put two and two together. It was easy. Who is he? Who is he? Michael... is Roslyn's husband. What are you talking about? What are you talking about, you morons? A husband's got a right to screw his own wife. No, he ain't. Ain't that right, Joey? Hello, Roslyn. It's Joey. I missed you. What do you mean you can't talk to me? Yeah, Roslyn! I went through hell with Brenda. She was gonna kill herself over you. I had to stay. But, listen, baby.
