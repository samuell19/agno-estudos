(tense music) - [Radio] Longitude number one pressurized set condition ISQ for launch, pressurization switch for nine. - [Narrator] The planet earth is dying, the disease is sin. - [Radio] After two doors unlocked missile ready for automatic firing, prepare to fire missile. Prepare to fire indicator probe. Permission to fire missiles away. (explosion booming) - [Narrator] With a noise like that of chariots, they leap over the mountaintops like a crackling fire, consuming stubble like a mighty army drawn up for battle. At the sight of them nations are in anguish. Every place turns pale. But Jesus said in John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. The latest bulletin of atomic scientists has issued a warning that every hour the planet earth moves closer to a nuclear disaster. At this moment, science is recording the time remaining on civilization's clock often referred to as the doomsday clock. The doomsday clock is real. It is at this very moment ticking off the minutes that bring us closer to prophetic events that could happen in our lifetime. (tense music) - [Soldier] David Michaels, do you wish to renounce your faith in your God and receive identification on your right hand? - [Woman] You're just like your brother. We cannot ignore God's word. (car tires screeching) (railroad crossing dinging) - [Woman] David, your brother's gonna try to beat that train! (train horn honking) (explosion booming) - You cannot ignore God's word without one day suffering eternal consequences. David, every time I've tried to talk to you boys about the Lord you turn a deaf ear. What can I do to get you to listen? - Um, I'm not ready for all that yet. I need time to-- - The only time you can be sure of is now. Robert ran out of time and went straight to eternity without God. David listen. God is trying to get your attention. - [Man On Speaker] Condition red, condition red. Immediately, we are under attack, this is condition red, condition red. (explosion booming) - [Man] Eternity. Eternity. Time without end. What prophet can there be to gain this whole round world all your own? And then to step into eternity and find out there that you've lost your soul. Not one thing this world offers you in exchange for your soul can take your guilt away, when time is no more. Jesus Christ is the only way. Reach out, and believe. My friend there's no chance in eternity to change your destiny. ♫ Life here ♫ Is quickly gone ♫ And your footsteps ♫ You can't retrace ♫ Your only hope is Jesus ♫ His pardon ♫ His saving grace ♫ Not one thing ♫ This world offers you ♫ In exchange for your soul ♫ Can take ♫ Your guilt away ♫ When time ♫ Is no more ♫ Just this moment ♫ Is yours ♫ To spend ♫ Which way will ♫ It be ♫ There's no chance ♫ In eternity ♫ To change ♫ Your destiny ♫ There's no chance ♫ In eternity ♫ To change ♫ Your destiny - [Man] Why did you take David Michaels to that platform? - [Man] Those were the last orders I received from you sir. - My orders said his execution at 1600 hours. You had words with Michaels, and you retaliated by taking him to the platform early. - Sir, request permission to speak. - Speak. - Sir, he is a fanatic believer, and as long as he remains alive he is a serious threat to our computer's security system. He must be executed. - That's not your decision. - No sir but those were my orders. - We just got the results of a counter intelligence effort on the Believers Underground movement. Michaels' computer savvy could be a key link in our plan. - He'll never cooperate sir. - Oh I think he will. Yes I think he will. He follows his God like a pied piper. He's predictable, he's totally predictable. And we'll use that to our advantage. - Jerry I want you to get with Captain Dierdorf immediately and execute the plan. If the enemy steps up their attacks in this sector they might put us out of commission. (tense music) - Drop your weapons. (gun firing) (door rumbling) (garage door rumbling) (truck humming) (gentle music) - Who are you? - I'm a double agent David with the Believers Underground. - Where are we going? - Away from that. We're about five and a half miles from what appears to be ground zero. We were lucky David. All we got was the tail end of that firestorm but when the radiation hits the ground we don't wanna be under it. - Seems hard to believe that God could use something that hideous for good. But he's done it before. - I admire your great faith David. Especially after all you've been through. - Look you've convinced me we're trying to avoid fallout, but what am I doing here and where are we going? - I want you to trust me. - Then take these cuffs off. - I helped you escape. - Escape to what? Take these things off. - I'm afraid to. - Then you'll have to trust me won't you? (tense music) (zipper zipping) (gasping) Why'd you risk your neck to get me out? - If you let me go I'll show you. The underground believers know you have exposed UNITE very successfully in your efforts to infiltrate and destroy their computer ID systems. - What do they want with me? - We need you to help construct a special computerized radio transmitter. This will create an instantaneous worldwide communications linkage to underground believers. - How do they expect to do that without Unite intercepting their signal? - Not they David, you. (laughing) - You know that requires highly sophisticated equipment. - They have it David it's all in place except for one piece. - One piece huh? Listen, I still don't understand. Why me? - Because you are one of the few believers who understand the workings of the module and can assemble it with other components and adjust it to function properly. - Do you have the module? - Well if everything worked the way Martin and I planned we do. - [David] Who is Martin? - Three of us infiltrated this sector about eight months ago. We lost one, Martin and I have been trying to get the module as well as trying to find a way to get it to the underground. When they informed us that you were here we had to move quickly. - Move where? - I don't know. But our instructions are in here. - Do you realize what you've got here? - I know it's important. - If all the other components are in place we can send out multi-directional or scrambled signals in such a way that we'll fool the satellite and it won't know where the signal's coming from. Now if the satellite doesn't know there's no way Unite can ever find the location of the transmitter. All we have to do is find the location of the transmitter. - There's the map. - Countless ages, Hells foundation quiver. Blend your voices war church and forward. (sighing) - I thought you were an expert in this. - Computers and decoding are not quite the same thing. Do you have the key for this? - I'm afraid we have to start from zero. The agent was discovered in the process of receiving these so this is all we have. - Terrific. Did Unite get these? - No. - How do you know? - Because he got these to me before Unite caught him and they killed him because he wouldn't reveal this information. - Can I-- - Sure. (buttons clicking) - Oh I wish Cathy were alive to see this. We worked a long time trying to mess up Unite's ID system. - If you hadn't got caught you may have succeeded. - Well maybe. But we lack the equipment. Look at this machine. (laughing) Unite, we're gonna destroy your whole communications network and your computers are gonna help us do it. (key tapping) I may need some time however. If I only had the key it would sure save a lot of, Turner. - Turner? - He's a friend. With a real knack for survival and a real understanding of prophecy. (sighing) Well wherever we're going this is some motor home. What do you got in this thing? - This is the restroom. And we've got a good supply of rations. Enough water. Even a limited fuel reserve. We've got a little problem, we had to move so fast we didn't have time to put ammo in here. - Well we better get a move on it. You can bet that when Unite recovers we're gonna be high on their list of things to do. (tense music) Hey, terrific. Terrific. Anyone ever tell Unite these dresses itch? Matthew Turner! - David there's no one here. - He knew what was coming. - Well even if he is alive he sees this tank out here he'll never show himself. - Matthew Turner! Matthew Turner it's David. Ah maybe you're right. I'm not even sure this is the same place. - [Matthew] On your bellies, now! - [David] Matthew it's me. - Don't move. - [David] It's me David. - Quiet. Forgive me David, your war wagon scared me. - [David] Well you knew it was me. - I didn't know if you were in control. Who's your friend? - Connie Wright. - She's a double agent with the Believers Underground. Hey you look great, you look great, I'm really glad to see you Matthew. - Well my goat's gone. So are my chickens. But I got fresh meat and a place to sleep. You're welcome to stay. - Stay where? What happened to your barn? - Well the they took it some time ago. I took everything I could salvage and moved underground. Actually it's the first time anyone's dropped in since I moved. (laughing) - This is nice. - It's all right. Does pretty good keeping us rodents from the buzzards. - Buzzards? - Yep, you've been out here for a while you know that the buzzards don't wait for the carcass. You see four or five of them together look out, because they'll attack and kill. - I don't think Unite's gonna find you here that's for sure. - Actually I'm more afraid of the doomsday people. - Doomsday people? You mean mutants? - Yes. Deformed victims of the bomb. Most of 'em are dying of leukemia. But even so some are renegades. In well organized bands of murderers and thieves. - Dear God. - Is this girl going to tell anybody where I live? - Hmm? Uh no. I've been thinking about you Matthew, praying for you. Wondering if you've received Christ's gift of salvation. - Is that why you came? - Well in a way you saved my life once. Hurts me to see you like this. - Do you think God would save someone who's led a host of souls into perdition? - Have you asked? - I can't ask. Why did you come? - I was wondering if those words mean anything to you. - Countless agents, Hells foundation quiver, blend your voices 1842 war church and forward. I don't know about the date, they sound like words of a hymn. Don't have any books anymore. What are you looking for? - I don't know these words are supposed to tell us where we're going. - If I was you I wouldn't plan much traveling. Not with the heat plagues and the darkness plague coming. - [David] Well we don't have much choice. - Well what's coming? - Well about the same thing that we've been having except worse. - How do you know? - Well, when the Christians were taken, God initiated his plan to allow sin to judge and destroy itself. Called the tribulation. Now it began with the seven seal judgments that lasted about three and a half years. They were the natural results of war and famine and pestilence. Then came the trumpet judgments, supernatural plagues, meted out by God as a corrective measure. A part of his redemptive program. Now during this time Satan worked through brother Christopher. They forced the world to receive the mark and worship the beast. Those who resisted brother Christopher and his false prophet were sent to the guillotine you know about that. - How much longer will this go on? - According to the book there's a great similarity between the trumpet judgments that we've been living through in the last couple of years and the bowl judgments that are coming soon. Now, the new plagues, will be stronger but they won't last as long. Probably about a year or less. Now the Bible shows that God designed the trumpet judgments to invite repentance and correction. The bowl judgments are to complete the wrath of God. Now according to Revelation 16:2 the first bowl judgment is to be an affliction of malignant sores, boils. Only those with the mark will be effected. The second bowl judgment according to the word will turn the seas to blood and destroy all life in the sea. Bowl number three does a similar thing to rivers and fountains of waters. Fresh water will be scarce. The fourth bowl effects the sun. Revelation 16:18 says it will scorch men with fire. I think that means those who worship brother Christopher. The fifth bowl is the judgment of darkness. Men having refused the light will get a real taste of darkness and the pain from the boils will intensify. Now the sixth bowl is the drying up of the Euphrates River making way for the great armies from the east and all the nations will gather for war in the valley of Mageddon. The seventh bowl concludes the final series of judgments, with tremendous atmospheric and geographic eruptions. A great earthquake and topographical convulsions will devastate most of the earth's surface. The Bible tells us that giant hail will fall from heaven and then, the battle of Armageddon. All the nations and kings of the earth will be there. First they will fight against each other and then against Christ. - Why do we have to go through all this? - Since the rapture, Christ has been absent. And sin has had complete control. During the battle, Christ will return. He will seize control of the world government and bring peace and prosperity. - Connie, what are you thinking? - I was thinking about Turner. He's strange. I mean, he seemed to know a lot about the Bible yet he doesn't seem to be a believer and apparently he doesn't wanna be one. - The idea of salvation seems to torment him. - But he has all that knowledge. - I wonder if maybe he isn't being eaten alive by that knowledge and the guilt of not having preached God's word to his congregation. He seems to have a compulsion to learn all he can in order to work out his own plan for salvation. He is a tormented man. - Why does he choose to live in that hole and eat rats? He may as well take the mark, least he could eat. - Probably what he used to preach. Salvation through good works. You know, do good, obey the law, and get to heaven. But Jesus said in Matthew 7:22, many will say to me on that day Lord Lord did we not prophecy in your name and in your name cast out demons and perform many miracles? And I will tell them plainly I never knew you, away from me you evildoers. The only way to get to the Father is through Jesus Christ. (screaming and glass shattering) (intense music) Open the door, if we wanted to hurt you we'd take you come on open up. - Who are you? - No mark. - So why should we go with you? - Hey look lady there's five good reasons running around out there maybe more. Now I'm trying to take you to safety I'm not gonna stand around here and negotiate open up. - Okay. (gentle music) - Making any progress? - A little. You know I think some of these words are code words because the number codes coincide with them. The others I think must be clue words because there doesn't seem to be any relationship. Anyway, what we seem to have here is a word code, plus a number code, and a tone code. - Which means? - Which means that the list of words you gave me is a lot more than a coded road map. It appears that the word code and the number tell us where to go. The tone code has a whole different purpose. - Can you tell where we're going? - Well I can put the code words into the computer, the clue words I can't obviously. But I figured out one. Countless ages is not a clue, it's a code. You see for every letter there's a number so the word is New Mexico. - [Connie] Where in New Mexico? - Now I'm afraid I won't know that until I figure out all the clues. - Any ideas about what the tone code means? - Well I put the tone codes in the computer and it came out like this. (computer beeping) In five words or less Connie can you name that tune? - That's all we have? Maybe your friend was right, maybe those words did come from a hymn. - Well I don't know, seems to me if that were true then all we'd have to do is find a hymn book and then find a hymn with the words in it. - Not if those tones are a mixture of hymns. - Well I think I'll get something to eat. I hope you're feeling better. - I am a little. - Thanks. If you feel like talking I'd like to know something about you. Where you've been who you are. - And how you've managed to escape the mark. - Well I don't really know who I am anymore. I used to be a woman that looked at life through a microscope, analyzing it and probing it. And looking for something anything that was real. I had dreams from childhood of maybe one day finding the cause, discovering the cure. I wanted to be a great scientist and save the world. Now we can hardly save ourselves. - Did you become a scientist? - Oh yes. (sighing) And I found reality, it turned out to be a nightmare. I shared my brilliance with the world and you know what I gave to mankind? Those people this afternoon. They suffer from acute X-ray, beta, and gamma ray disfiguration. - Nuclear cancer. - [Woman] And you know what their main objective in life is now? - Survival. - To kill all of us who were in any way responsible for this madness. - That's a pretty heavy load to carry Linda. - Look so young, how could you possibly blame yourself? - I began my career with the Radiation Research Society at Stanford Medical Center when I was 20. It was while we were there that so many people disappeared. My husband Chuck was one of them. - How did you avoid the mark? - Just a few weeks after Chuck's disappearance Jodie and I went down a weetalk in the Pacific with two other research scientists and it really wasn't a matter of avoiding the mark we were told that we could receive it on our return to the states and then the war broke out. - What about your husband? - Chuck and I saw life from a different perspective. My questions were always how, how were things made, how could we control them? His questions were always why, why was there pain, sorry? His philosophy never seemed to be very realistic to me. - Why? - Well I remember him one day telling me that mankind didn't like the moral demands of God. That death, eternity, and judgment seemed a long way off and that man would just live with his guilt and sin and try to forget it by working, and playing. - Did he ever talk to you about prophecy? - He was always warning me about what the Bible said would come. - And what'd you think about that? - I had more important things to think about. What he was telling me just didn't seem real. - Does it seem real now? - All I know is that God took my dream and turned it into something ugly. I'll tell you what's real David, thirst, hunger, heartbreak, and fear. - Did you ever think that maybe it wasn't God that shattered your dream? Maybe it was sin that shattered your dream. It did mine and others like us. Because we chose to live our lives our way instead of God's. I think sin destroyed our nation. And all the nations that turned their backs on God. You talk about heartbreak Linda, Jesus had a divine and grand design for our lives. We were his dream. But we broke his heart. And you wanna know what the reality of it is? He still loves us. Think about that. Well, feeling better after a little shuteye? - [Jodie] No I don't but thanks anyway. - Jodie. - Anything I can do to help? - Yeah you can give me back my dad. You could get me a boyfriend to take me to school and dances and friends and a nice house to live in with my own room and all the other things I have a right to that God has ruined, and you could get me away from those hideous monsters! - Come on kiddo, things will look brighter in the morning. - David I'm sorry. David, this afternoon when you found us, Jodie and I were making our way to some Midwestern city, we felt that our chances for survival would be better there and according to your map we're about 60 miles north of Omaha. Would you consider-- - Omaha was the first target they hit. - Well that's to our advantage. It's very likely that the radiation has decayed sufficiently to allow the area to be inhabited again. - Well we can try if the roads are still intact, we could go south take 35 to Oklahoma City and then 40 west. - [Linda] Where do you get fuel for this thing? - We can't go into the cities where Brother Christopher's government is in force, so we look for bombed out cities that are no longer populated, and siphon from cars and trucks. - Well how do you find out if the city is populated. - We're constantly monitoring Radio TV signals. When we receive a transmission we avoid the area. - Who would've thought it would come to this? - [Connie] David, I've got a signal, it's strong. - [Man] And I say let us break their bonds asunder and cast their hearts from us. I am the prince of this world. In my name, and in the power of my glory, with advanced missile and nuclear technology, we will blow this self righteous God from his throne. You can see via satellite we are already moving equipment towards Palestine. Soon, he will not plague us anymore with famine and fire, with pittance and pestilence, we will meet this God of tears and torment in the valley of decision. We will settle once and for all who will be king. - He thinks he's deceiving God and the people, he's really deceiving himself. That signal wasn't coming from Omaha was it? - [Connie] Fremont, Nebraska. We are going south now aren't we? - Yep. - [Connie] Fremont's west, we're okay. (tense music) - [David] Dear God. - [Connie] What was it, gas? - No. Connie run a level on the radiation. (keys tapping) - The radiation's decayed I guess it's okay to get out. - This city was violated just a few days ago then. - How do you know? - People are still in their shelters. - Isn't gas a possibility? - Nope, those bodies were picked clean by vultures who wouldn't touch that flesh if there had been any chemicals in it. - Vultures? I wanted to get out. - I think we could. We should be careful. I think the banquet's pretty much over. (door rumbling) - If this town was bombed how come none of the buildings were ruined? - They dropped it on the sat base and that's about 12 miles away. - The fallout comes this far? - [Linda] Oh yeah. - Must not have been much, trees look normal. - Radiation doesn't have any effect on the foliage, oh it does a little bit but you can't see it, in fact, I was told that two weeks after they dropped the first test bomb plants were growing in the crater. - David, the aspirin is gone from the first aid kit and I'm catching a little cold could we take a couple of hours to pick up a few things? - Um, let me check something first okay? Listen it's 10 minutes to three. Exactly 3:30 sharp we're gonna leave so if you see anything suspicious or the all clear sounds get back here on the double and I do mean on the double all right? - Okay. - Oh, Connie wait a second I wanna talk to you. I think I figured out the tone code. - [Connie] Really? - It looks to me like it has two purposes. First, and I think Turner was right, the words and notes may be from a hymn. Now the notes are scrambled so I can't tell which hymn it is. It could be any number, we'll have to isolate it. - Go on. - Well this may sound crazy to you, but one of the clues, blend your voices, makes me think that wherever the transmitter is a group of people are gonna sing, or a recording of a hymn will be broadcast. The second part has to do with destroying Unite's computer system. - That's great David, but how did you get all that from just those few words? - I was working on the tones, trying to get some information from Unite's main computer center when I discovered I had a direct link to the main program. - But how could the tones give you access to the main computer? I don't understand. - Okay, music is sound to us, but to the computer it's just numbers. But those numbers turned out to be the access code. - So you're telling me that we have access to Unite's main computer? But what does that do for us? - Well, you have to remember that the computer will do whatever you tell it to do. It won't ask questions. Now I can write my own computer program through this equipment right here, transfer it to Unite's main computer center program. It won't ask any questions because we are Unite, it'll use my program. - I still don't understand what that's going to do for us David. - Well, I can write a program with musical notes transpose them into binary words which are really numbers then replace Unite's program with my new information. - Are you telling me that we can sabotage Unite's entire communications system with a hymn? - [David] Yes. - What about backup systems? - Well that's a problem. You see I could destroy it right now if I knew when the backup system was online. Hey you better get going so you can get back in time. - What happens to the people who get a dose of radiation that's not fatal? - Well it depends on the amount they receive but in most cases the radiation destroys the white blood cells which means they have no immunity. - Is that what the doomsday people suffer from? - Uh huh, and even if they catch a common cold it'll kill them. - What happens if they just get a little bit? - Oh the symptoms vary but they could get boils. - Boils? - Car bunkles. - Stupid things are driving me nuts. - We'll find a drug store maybe some penicillin will help. (tense music) - Wow! Can we take it for a ride? - Don't touch it. We've gotta find something to wipe it off with first. - Isn't this good enough? - I guess it's okay I don't wanna take any more sweaters. - We have to return these? - Of course. - But there aren't any people. - But they'll be back. There weren't very many people on the streets they probably had a pretty good advanced warning. - Why did they all go to shelters? - I don't know, probably a lot of reasons. I remember once in one of the western states a flash flood warning was issued in one of the canyon areas and a lot of people were evacuated but a good number of people stayed and they lost their lives. Some people always seem to think a warning doesn't mean them. (upbeat music) (tense music) (truck rumbling) (upbeat music) (tense music) (clothes hangers rattling) (screaming) (truck rumbling) - Uh oh, dregs. Rick stay with the unit, Don get in there and get that dreg out! (screaming) - Please don't hurt me. - I don't wanna hurt you. Please, I need someone to help. - [Connie] David, this is Connie, if you read, 10-4. - [David] Connie 10-4. - [Connie] David, I'm in the basement of a drug store. There's mutants and soldiers crawling all over the place. Take the list of code words I gave you and go to the fourth group of words. Take the last two letters in the word in the fourth group and head toward our destination. Then stop and wait for me. - Connie, we can't leave without you what if something happens? You've got the component. - [Connie] Look, I'm okay, I'll be fine. I'll get a vehicle and catch up later, now go! (intense music) - [Man] This is Unite. We know you're in here! Come out with your hands over your head! Come on, wherever you are, I'm warning you, come out now! (screaming) Hey! (screaming) - [Linda] David! - [Jodie] David! - [David] Freeze! - He only wants help he's sick. - [David] They're all sick come on. (somber music) (door rumbling) - [Jodie] And you call yourself a believer? (intense music) - Hit it! - Well come on, get in. (gentle music) - What's the fourth word? - Okay, you mean the fourth word or the fourth section? - [David] Section. - [Linda] Okay it's not a word it's a number, 1842. - Last two numbers toward countless ages. 42 miles west and wait. Hi Jodie, Jimmy. - Last night you told my mom that God had a grand design for her life. What right have you to tell her that you're an escaped convict. - [David] That's right Jodie I am a convict. - Then how do you come off telling all that holy stuff to my mother? - Your mother is carrying an awesome burden. A burden only God can lift by his forgiveness. - Before you start talking to me about God you better prove to me that there is one 'cause he certainly hasn't shown me much. How far is it across this stupid land till we get to where we're going? - You in a hurry? - I'm bored. - [David] You're not the least bit concerned about what I said out there are you? - Should I be? - Anything could happen to you. Today, tomorrow, you could have a blood clot hit your brain and drop dead as we talk. - You think I care? Anything is better than this. - Even hell? - [Jodie] What do you think this is? - Bitterness won't change anything Jodie. Why don't you look at the bright side of things? You got a friend your age. - Oh big deal, I find a boy and he's got a face like a burnt marshmallow. - I suppose you heard that. - That was kinda funny, 'cause when I was 13 I used to worry about girls not liking me because I had pimples. What she said out there, I was wondering if you could answer me a few questions. - I'll try. - Well you said something about God wanting to forgive us. I don't think I've sinned. What you said out there it really bothers me. - Do you know what sin is? - Yeah. Lying, cheating, and stealing. - Do you know the story of Adam and Eve? - Sure. - [David] What did Adam do? - Well God told him not to eat the fruit. And the devil conned him into it. - Romans 5:12 says one man brought sin into the world and sin brought death and since all have sinned death spread to all people. The Bible says we inherited that sin Jimmy. You and I and all mankind. We were sinners the day we were conceived and as we went through life sin made itself real in our very being. Our hearts, our attitudes, our motives, and in the very mechanism that allows us to make decisions our will. - Then what you're saying is that we can be good to others and we can go we can do good things but no matter what we do on our own it's not gonna get us to heaven. - No matter how good we are in our lives we're still sinners separated from God, but God loved us so much that he sacrificed his son Jesus Christ to die on the cross and shed his blood to wash away that sin. - And when we believe that we're no longer separated. - That's right. - Then sin's actually born inside? - Sin festers inside. Then it's spread by hate, greed, bitterness, and then it comes to the surface. The stealing, cheating, lying and all those things that create a meaningless life. (intense music) - [Radio] Sector 115 to 17. - [Radio] 17 go ahead. - [Radio] We aren't receiving Michaels' voice we'll try another frequency. - [Radio] We're having trouble too. - Headquarter sector 115. - [Radio] 115 go ahead. - Try to keep your voice print monitors on their frequency. - [Radio] Okay. - Try to get a print if you can. - [Radio] We'll try. - Rodger. - Why did Jesus Christ have to shed his own blood? - In the Bible, in the Old Testament, animals were brought to the priests as sacrifices by the Israelites. These animals had to be perfect Jimmy, without blemish. The sin of the one making the sacrifice was transferred to the innocent offering. Then the animal was slain and its blood was sprinkled on the altar as a temporary covering for one's sin. God's special lamb, his son Jesus Christ, a man without sin without spot or blemish, shed his blood on the cross to conquer death and free us from sin forever. Christ took our punishment. - Then the animal sacrifice was just temporary. But the cross that was once and for all. - The cross and the blood and the resurrection is what made it permanent. - And anybody that believes that is a believer? - It means everyone who believes can receive salvation, but everyone isn't a believer. They can be, if they ask God. John 1:12 reads but to all who received him who believed in his name he gave the power to become children of God. Salvation is a gift. And when a person receives that gift they become a new creature. - Well how come no one ever explained that to me before? - A lot of people probably tried Jimmy but a lot of us weren't listening. And some Christians were too tired and too lazy, or too ashamed of Jesus to share him. But now that you've heard the plan of salvation God holds you responsible. (fire crackling) Rock of ages was first, churches one foundation was second, church and rock have to go together. Church and rock. Church made of rock. Rock that looks like a church. A rock that looks like a church! - A rock that looks like a church? Shouldn't Connie be here by now? - She said tonight, didn't say what time. I sure don't like leaving her there. Maybe we should go back for her. - How could we find her? She knows where we are, 42 miles west and wait. And besides she'll see our campfire. - [David] So will everyone else. - Why do you people wear those robes? - Same reason the Arabs did it's to keep out the heat. Our skin's very sensitive to the sun. I make you uncomfortable don't I? - Don't you hate the people that did that to you? - [Jimmy] No. - I do. - For my sake Jodie, or for yours? I think hate's one of the worst sicknesses a person can have. - Well listen to you you sound like David. Was your daddy a preacher or something? - No. My dad owned an exotic pet shop in Omaha. - Oh and I suppose you had some kind of exotic pet. - When I was a boy had a pet python. His name was Julius Squeezer. (chuckling) You do know how to laugh. - I had a pet chipmunk. He could talk. We used to talk to each other. My dad brought him home from the zoo where he used to work. They had to close the zoo because a wild cat strike. - You feel better? - Yeah. - What do you think about what David said this afternoon? - I don't think anything about it. - [Jimmy] Why not? - Why should I? - Well David could tell you better than I could but if we die out here we'll be in eternity forever without God. - So. - Well David said we don't understand God's love right now but in eternity we will. And to be without God, it'll be unbearable. - He really brainwashed you. - There's a difference between being brainwashed and hearing the truth. - Jimmy I think that's fine if you need God but don't push it on me because I don't. - You wanna know what you need? You need a good spanking. That would solve your problem. - My problem? Just what is my problem and who do you think you are? - Just someone who would like to like you. - You think I care? You're not exactly Redford you know. - See that's your problem. - [Jodie] Look, I don't have to listen to you. - No you don't but you might as well because you're gonna stay here until I'm done. You're gonna hear something for once besides how pretty you are which is obviously what you've been told all your life. You are pretty on the outside. Do you wanna know what you look like on the inside? Jodie, we can cover up our faces with makeup but we can't hide what's inside our hearts. Think our hearts are so wicked that this is what they look like to God. Only God's forgiveness can heal them. - David you asked me the other night if I thought about the fact that God still loves us. Well I have been thinking about that. Is it still possible for us to receive Christ? - Revelation 20, verse four reads then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those who had been beheaded for their testimony to Jesus and for the word of God and who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ 1,000 years. The main reason for the tribulation is the judgment of unbelieving Israel in the world. One of the main results according to the scripture I just quoted and Revelation 7:9 is the salvation of vast hosts of people from every kindred tribe, tongue, and nation. But God is merciful and just. And is not willing that any should perish. That's why millions have received his mercy. But according to Second Thessalonians many believe that if a person heard and understood the plan of salvation before the rapture or even now and rejected it he would not get a second chance. Let me read you something else. Second Thessalonians second chapter verses 10, 11, and 12. And with all wicked deception for those who are to perish because they refuse to love the truth and so be saved. Therefore God sends upon them a strong delusion to make them believe what is false so that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness. - Chuck was always telling me about things in the Bible. - My mom was always trying to tell me and my brother about Christ. - Did you understand anything that your mother told you about the Bible? - [David] I never heard it but I wouldn't even listen. - Then you rejected it. - Once I heard the plan of salvation and understood it, I didn't reject it. If I had known then before the rapture what I know now, I would've received Christ in the twinkling of an eye. And one reason is because if I'd had any idea what it would've been like to feel the total fulfillment of God's great love I would've done it. And secondly, if I'd had any idea the misery that I'd have to go through in these times scrounging for food, facing execution, and watching watching loved ones tortured and killed, it would've been so easy then. - It could be too late for Jodie and me. - As I said, only God knows the condition of the heart, but according to Second Thessalonians if anyone before the rapture heard and understood the plan of salvation from a friend, a pastor in church, or in a movie or TV and rejected it the opportunity for a second chance now would be about zero. - I never really believed that God existed. - God proves his existence by your existence. Certainly as a scientist you weren't foolish enough to think that there wasn't a creation? - David, I fooled myself into believing that the bomb would never be used again. I thought that my research was in the national interest. - Well it appeared to be in the national interest as long as it was a deterrent to war. What have we got now? - Well I've got guilt. - Nuclear science wasn't really the problem, it's what sin caused us to do with it. God gave us the resource, but he warned us in Matthew 25 to strive for its wise and responsible use. It's like fire, we cook with it, generate power with it, but in the hands of an arsonist it's ugly. If you're interested in receiving Christ the time to do it is now. - I need a little more time David. - I said that once. I wish now I hadn't waited. (tense music) - Sorry you had to die for me. I guess it wasn't fair. Thank you. I don't have too much in my life to offer you but I do accept your offer of salvation. Cleanse me Lord from my sin. Let me come to your heaven. - 10-4 go ahead. - [Connie] I've got a vehicle but can't risk being followed. Keep moving ahead toward countless ages and keep me advised as to your position. - Connie where are you? We're coming back to get you. - [Connie] No, we can't risk it, I'll catch up. (truck rumbling) David, this is Connie, hold your position. - First two letters fourth word from the top subtract two from the second add 11 to the first heading towards countless ages. - Those turkeys. (tense music) - Meanwhile here in Oklahoma there were new travel restrictions placed on motor vehicles. Beginning Monday no persons will be allowed within a 50 mile radius of a radiation belt even if relatives were living in the area. The big news of the hour is the plague that has hit many parts of the world. In this country reports have come in from Provincetown Harbor that blood red sea waters have caused sea life to diminish rapidly. This is not new to the fishermen in Japan, they have been plagued with this new and unexplained phenomena for nearly a week. The stench-- - Are we near a city? - Oklahoma City, we just went around it. (tense music) (helicopters whirring) - [Man] Turn your vehicle around and go back. The Unite command unit will intercept you. Once there you will transfer in an orderly fashion to that unit. Your failure to comply will force us to eliminate you and your party. We know your unit has no provisions for our movement so do not try to negotiate with threats of retaliation. You will execute our instructions at once. - David can't we shoot them down? - I don't think that's a very good idea. - Well we're safe in here. - They're equipped with anti-tank rockets. Where's the other one? - [Jodie] Right behind us. - Well David, it's so good to see you again. - [Radio] Unit 616 this is sector 17 over. - Unit 616 go ahead. - [Radio] Unit 616 identify your position, we're going to send a bigger chopper to bring your prisoners back this will lessen the chance of escape affirm. - Affirm, position at 45 miles northeast of sector 117. Area B as in Baker. Over. - [Radio] 10-4. - What happens next? - Oh come on David, I think you know the procedure. I don't think that I can get the code out of ya but we have a man back at sector 117 that has a certain talent. It's painful but effective. - I think I'm gonna get sick. (laughing) - Maybe with him all we have to do is say please. - He's got leukemia. (laughing) - Well, all we have to do now is just wait. (intense music) (tense music) - Get outta here this thing's gonna blow! (somber music) - [Jimmy] Jodie, you can cover up your face with makeup but you can't hide what's inside your heart. (explosion booming) - Do what you can for him. I gotta find a way to camouflage our wagon before the choppers arrive. (explosion booming) You start walking east until that chopper picks you up and I better not see you again. - [Linda] You worried about the chopper? - There isn't gonna be any chopper. Doesn't take two and a half hours to fly 45 minutes. They're just playing with us. They could wipe us out in a second if they wanted. How's he doing? - Oh the bleeding stopped but he's still unconscious. - [Connie] David, do you read? - Connie 10-4. - [Connie] 10-4. - Current position fourth word from the top, center two letters, add 150 toward countless ages. - [Connie] Affirmative, I'm only 20 miles behind you now. I thought we'd had it. - Connie we're gonna wait for you. - [Connie] No David, Unite's radios are buzzing about your capture. They're onto you now and if they put you out of service I've still got the component. - 10-4. Hells foundation quiver. It's a clue not a code. See what you think of this. Suppose the light of God's people got so close to Satan's headquarters figuratively speaking that Hell's very foundation shook. Now where would we have to be to accomplish that? - Down. - A mine or a shaft? - A well. - A cave. No, caves don't go down they go back. - What do you plan to do about him? - Take him with us. - Why can't we leave him here with some rations and then in a few hundred miles tell Unite where he is. - No he'd be buzzard meat out there in his weakened condition, let's wait till he gets a little stronger. (tense music) (truck rumbling) (vulture screeching) - David. (coughing) Not as predictable as I thought. But I didn't think you were a fool until now. (coughing) Do you realize what you did? - God said in Romans 12:20 if thine enemy hunger feed him. When you took that mark, do you realize what you did? You sold your soul to Satan. I don't know if it's possible for you to ever understand what the love of Jesus Christ in a man's heart can do. I'm truly sorry for that. (pump cranking) - [Jodie] Hey look water. - Yeah that's terrific. You know we can boil it and that'll purify it. - No, that just concentrates the radiation making it deadlier. You know I doubt there's been any fallout in this area and even if there has the sand would filter it out. (wind blowing) (vulture squawking) (helicopter whirring) (intense music) - Jerry. Tell 'em to leave or I'll. - Or you'll what David? - Jerry. How'd they know you were here? - David you saved my life, I'm about to do the same for you. We're even. (vulture squawking) (pump cranking) (intense music) (screaming) (sobbing) (helicopter whirring) (gun firing) (gun firing) (explosion booming) (explosion booming) - That's twice they knew exactly where we were. - Well we've only gone 150 miles since Unite knew our last position. - Yeah but we could've gone north or south how'd they know we've been going west. - I haven't got the slightest idea I don't even know where we are. (tense music) (vultures screeching) (helicopter whirring) (suspenseful music) (truck rumbling) (computer beeping) - [David] We've got to find shelter or we'll burn this thing up. - [Linda] A state park, they'll have shelter. - [David] Connie, fourth section from the top first two letters. From our last communication at 108 to countless ages. Add 108 toward countless ages from our last position. - [Connie] 10-4. (sighing) - At least it's a little cooler in here. - It's gonna be hotter than blazes in here too. At least we're outta the sun's direct rays. - [Jodie] Aw, what's the matter? Don't you have any friends? - Praise God. I think we got us a cave. So, if it's a cave, near a large rock shaped like a church then all I've gotta do is figure out war forward and 1842. War forward in 1842? They gotta be crazy to give me this. All right, we've got a cave, near a rock, that looks like a church. (computer beeping) (metal crackling) (radio sizzling) From now on we only go out at night. We don't need sun stroke. We got visitors. - Unite? - I'm afraid not. It's too hot out there now for them to make any major moves but you can bet they'll be on us like flies tonight. - How do we get outta here? - Well, this evening when it's cool enough to run the engine and the air system in the wagon we'll make a run for it. - If it's cool enough for us won't it be cool enough for them too? - Well they have eyes and skin that are super sensitive to light and to heat so we should have, what do you say David maybe a half hour head start? - No more than that. Praise God we got that. - Praise God? Things seem to get progressively worse and you say praise God. - We've been groaning and bellyaching about the heat I think it's about to save our lives. God knows what he's doing, even if we don't. (explosion booming) (sobbing) - Mom, I'm scared. - Jesus said in John 14, that we don't need to be afraid. If I could've had a conversation with your little caterpillar friend and I said to him why do you crawl around in the dirt? He might've said to me because I'm earthbound. It's impossible for me to fly. And then I said well I could tie wings around your body. He'd say, it wouldn't work. I still couldn't fly. You see it would be like those who try to become Christians simply by going to church and reading the Bible but that alone did not make them Christians. They had to have a new birth. Your little friend would've made it through this heat spell he would've spun a cocoon and one day emerged as a beautiful butterfly and would've soared the heavens. That's what happened to Jimmy. It happens to everybody who is reborn in Christ. But the Bible tells us that if we don't, we shall not see the kingdom of God. (truck rumbling) (helicopters whirring) (intense music) Let's take cover in the back. (guns firing) Wait a minute. (guns firing) - [Linda] What's the matter with you have you lost your mind? - Good show Linda, good show. Except your actors did badly. - [Linda] David. - Now how do you suppose Unite could follow me and at the same time make me think they were chasing me? Mock attack. - I don't know David, I'm curious to know the answer to that myself. - And because I'm a fugitive if they didn't come after me I'd wonder why, I'd get suspicious and think they were following me huh? - David listen. - No you listen. Now I don't know how in the world you're feeding my positions to Unite but the next time you're in touch with 'em you can tell 'em from me that I thought it was a very clever plan. Right down to our capture to throw off any suspicions I may have had. If it wasn't for Jimmy God bless his heart for saving our necks it might've been interesting to experience Jerry's plan for our escape. - I wouldn't do that to you. (sighing) - God forgive me if I'm wrong about you Linda. But somebody's giving Unite our positions and I don't think it's Jodie. Question is, how am I gonna find that transmitter site without Unite following me in? (keys tapping) - Michaels' voice has been printed it's in the computer. - Good work. - As soon as we get a transmission we'll be able to get a reading on his position. - Well gentlemen, it seems that although we had a small setback this afternoon, David Michaels is about to lead us to the target. (gentle music) - Let's get the wagon back in the tunnel it's cooling off fast. (thunder rolling) - [Jodie] I'm freezing can anybody find a jacket or a blanket around here. - [Linda] Well here's Connie's jacket. - [Jodie] Don't you need it? - [Linda] No I'm warm. - [Jodie] David can't we turn the light on? - [David] No no, leave it dark maybe they won't find us. - [Linda] I wonder if they know we're in here? (screaming) David let's go! - [David] No we're safer in here these walls around here are too narrow we can't upset it. - [Linda] They're already upset! (gun firing) - [David] That ought to hold 'em for a while. - [Linda] Why is it dark? - [David] I seem to remember you saying a little while back that you needed proof that God existed. Well he just showed you Revelation 16:10 come to pass. - [Linda] What does Revelation 16:10 say? - [David] The fifth angel poured out his flask upon the throne of the creature from the sea and his kingdom was plunged into darkness. (tense music) - You're telling me that they haven't moved since it got dark? Well, make them move. We've got to find that radio station and destroy it as soon as possible. - [Jodie] How long have we been in here? - [Linda] Seems like months. - It's clearing. (gentle music) Hey, what does that big rock look like to you guys? - [Linda] It looks kind of like a cathedral. - Cathedral, church. Church rock could that be church rock? (upbeat music) We've been camped under the very thing we've been searching for for I don't know how long. - He is present. He's here David, he's always been here. - Red Rock State Park, West Arroyo Ratan one mile. West Arroyo Ratan? West Arroyo Ratan, W-A-R, this is war! This is war! (laughing) And now all we gotta do is figure out forward and 1842, hmm. Forward. I wonder if it could be 1842 something forward from the rock. Feet, yards, miles. Those numbers that doesn't make much sense. - Maybe it's a numerological code. - Maybe let's try it. Let's see 1842, one plus eight is nine plus four is 13 plus two is 15, 15 that's a one and a five one plus five is six. Six something forward from the rock. Can't be feet or yards obviously. It has to be miles, six miles forward from the rock, let's try that. Let's go back and find Connie first. - With Russia and the United States nearly destroyed it appears that China is the thorn in the flesh of Brother Christopher and it appears now that China is going to challenge him for control of the Middle East. Already many nations are moving their troops over the Himalaya road built by west Pakistan and the Red Chinese to join forces with the tactical might of its European allies. The only other obstacle in the troop move from China to Palestine was the Euphrates River and it appears now that the mighty riverbed is dry allowing free movements of troops and tanks toward Israel, the Galilee region near Hypha. - And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon. Connie, we've gone fourth section from the top first two letters minus eight east of countless ages. Bring us in, do you read? Jodie stay with the vehicle I'm pretty sure Connie's around here somewhere. - Connie! (tense music) - I don't believe it when the quakes come that thing'll crumble like matchsticks. God wouldn't put those people somewhere where they'd be wiped out. The cave must be on higher ground. - How far away from the cave? - Well let's see we're about four miles east of the rock. If we're right about our six miles in front of it should be about 10 miles. (tense music) What are you doing? - It's only music David I found these tapes in Omaha. (snapping) (intense music) - [Linda] Maybe we should give Connie the location of the cave. It's possible she can receive and not transmit. - The radio remains silent from here on out. - If Unite was gonna zero in on our position from your radio signals they would've done that a long time ago. - Not true, our transmissions weren't long enough for them to get a fix on us. - Well how long does it take to tell Connie where the cave is? - Look, by now they've printed my voice. One word this close to the cave and my mission becomes their target. - What about my voice or mom's? - Jerry would recognize your voices too. - So what do we do now? - We hide until dark while I try and figure out a way to get to that cave without Unite following me in. - I think I have a plan on how to get a message across to Connie. - You wait till I'm half dead before you show up? Your chopper's always bringing my fuel and my rations late. Why did you put me through all of this? - We've had a few problems of our own young lady. Our equipment got so hot we couldn't use it, aircraft blew up in hangers. If you hadn't of let them run off without you in Omaha this wouldn't have happened. - I told them to go. My training officer failed to tell me when these would appear. - So, everybody's got 'em. - Believers don't get them. - [Jodie] Dad go to work eight miles west of your home, church is the rock of ages, calculus 1846 from the fort. We're infection from the top go forward! - 10 miles west, church is the rock, countless. Count less, 1836 from the fourth word that's 1842, that's six, six miles forward from the rock. Come on we've gotta move. - What's the rush you got the component. - No I don't. - You better you had specific orders to keep it no matter what. - I left it in my jacket pocket the day we were in Omaha, I left the vehicle without it. - What'd you do that for? - Because I didn't know I wasn't coming back that's why now lay off it! - Hey. Where'd you get this? Connie had it. - I found it in Connie's jacket. - Well, why did she want me to think she had it all this time? Oh no. Connie's been giving away our positions. (sighing) Why? Why? - That should be obvious. - No I mean why would God let her be right in the middle of this operation? This is God's mission and the enemy was right in there with us. - It's not too late. You better tell sector 115 to contact main headquarters and have them change the access code. David's figured out the one we have now. - How long have you known that? - For weeks, but there was no way I could contact anybody, remember? - I'm afraid I haven't been a very good example of how a believer should behave. I'm sorry Linda. Please forgive me. - Forgiven. I wanna ask you a question. - Okay. - What are you doing? - Oh all this, well, it's a decoy. I'm gonna send this thing out across the desert as far as it will go as bait. And if I plan this right Unite's gonna be going after this vehicle and we're gonna be on our way to the cave, hopefully unnoticed. - In order for them to locate this don't we have to transmit a signal? - We're gonna be music to their ears. (thunder booming) - For just as the lightning comes from the east, and flashes to the west, so shall the coming of the son of man be. Wherever the corpse is, there will the vultures gather. Matthew 24. - You sound like one of them. - Well, Unite trained me for over a year to sound like one of them. - By the time Unite locks into this they'll get a big thrill. (upbeat music) (alarm ringing) - Red alert, red alert. - [Man] Secure stations. Prepare for confrontation. - Aircraft in the air. Emergency options to fly. (helicopter whirring) - [Radio] Unit 26, unit 26 David Michaels is moving east repeat east towards target, he is approximately one mile behind you turn around and follow, repeat turn around and follow. Our decoding was an error, unless you apprehend them we may not locate-- - No, you're wrong! We're not going the wrong way. (alarm ringing) (upbeat music) (train crossing dinging) What are you doing are you crazy? (train horn blowing) (explosion booming and screaming) (helicopter whirring) - Unite 969 to base I've located the unit looks to me like a diversionary tactic I'm not certain but I'm setting down now to check you better standby to alert other aircraft to concentrate the search in the western sector. (rumbling) (rumbling) - [David] Praise God there it is. - How are we gonna get in there? They'll think you're Unite. - When I show 'em the words to the hymn and the components they'll let us in. Come on let's go. (thunder booming) - Everybody, praise God they made it. (upbeat music) - [David] You're aware there's a dam. - 10.3 miles due east as a matter of fact. And this cave is over 7,000 feet above sea level. Well there it is, it's all yours. - This is it? - It's all we need. Signal originates here is transmitted to a relay station with a satellite dish, from there it's transmitted and broadcast worldwide. (rumbling) ♫ Onward Christian soldiers ♫ Marching us to war ♫ With the other people ♫ Glory done before ♫ Onward these people ♫ Join our happy song ♫ Lift with us your voices ♫ Hear the dryad song (alarm ringing) (computer buzzing and beeping) - [Man] Secure stations. Secure stations. ♫ Glory Lord and honor ♫ Unto Christ the king ♫ This will come the sages ♫ Let the angels sing ♫ Onward Christian - Lord, God, forgive me. (beeping) (alarm ringing) (banging) (thunder cracking) Who am I compared to you, who loved me so much that you gave your life for me. (alarm ringing) (explosion booming) (water flowing) - [Man] Look out what is that beeping? (water flowing) (woman screaming) - Lord Jesus, please adopt me and free me from all my sin. Thank you Jesus. Amen. - Linda, to be with him at this moment is like a song of praise. In spite of all the evil, the rejoicing around the world among believers is fantastic and it's eternal. I don't know what's in your heart right now, only God knows that. But according to John 3:3 the only way we can see God's kingdom is to be born from above and have his forgiveness. To be part of God's kingdom or to have to live for eternity with the agony and remorse and regret of those who rejected him and his love. Oh Linda, God in his faithfulness has given you a choice. ♫ Not one thing this world offers you ♫ In exchange for ♫ Your soul ♫ Can take ♫ Your guilt away ♫ When time is no more ♫ Just this moment is yours ♫ To spend ♫ Which way will it be (laughing and sobbing) ♫ There's no chance in eternity ♫ To change ♫ Your destiny (explosions booming) ♫ There's no chance ♫ In eternity ♫ To change ♫ Your destiny
