WHY DON'T YOU TELL YOUR VIEWERS THAT I WAS SET UP [INDISTINCT]? THEY'RE DOING EVIL, WICKED THINGS TO PEOPLE. YOU GUYS ARE COMPLETELY MISSING THE POINT. THIS WHOLE THING IS NOT EVEN ABOUT ME. WHAT IS IT ABOUT THEN? I WISH I KNEW. ALEX, DID YOU KILL THOSE PEOPLE? I WAS JUST DEFENDING MYSELF. THEY WERE TRYING TO KILL ME. WHY WOULD THE POLICE DEPARTMENT OR THE SCORE OF FEDERAL AGENTS BE RUNNING AFTER A SECOND GRADE SCHOOL TEACHER? SOMEONE WHO SAYS HE'S JUST TRYING TO PROTECT HIS FAMILY. IT'S A GOOD QUESTION TO ASK YOURSELVES. MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING WE DON'T SEE HERE. SOME HIDDEN AGENDA, PERHAPS? ANOTHER PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. AT ANY RATE, I THINK THAT BEFORE WE BECOME JUDGE AND JURY, ALEX GAINER SHOULD HAVE HIS SAY. AFTER ALL, WHAT IF HE IS INNOCENT? CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

BECAUSE THEY SAID I WAS LIKE THEM. I WAS STRONGER. THE OTHERS DID NOT LAST. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SOLDIERS. CREATING WARRIORS THAT COULD KILL WITHOUT REMORSE. MAKING THEM INVINCIBLE. JESUS CHRIST. LOOK. YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME, HARRY. I DIDN'T WANNA HURT ANYBODY. I JUST WANT MY LIFE BACK. I BELIEVE YOU, ALEX. HEY, HARRY. WE GOTTA GET THIS IN. WE GOT COMPANY. * MUSIC YOU SON OF A BITCH! I DIDN'T DO THIS. YOU SET ME UP. I DIDN'T DO THIS. HARRY! GIVE ME THE TAPE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GIVE IT BACK TO ME. HEY, HAVEN'T YOU HEARD OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT? HEY, THAT'S MY CAMERA. WHERE DO YOU THINK-- THAT'S MY CAMERA, COME BACK HERE. HARRY, THEY TOOK MY CAMERA. ALEX, YOU'RE SURROUNDED. TRYING TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW WOULD BE REALLY FOOLISH. THINK ABOUT YOUR FAMILY. BYE. DON'T YOU GUYS EVER SMILE? HEY, HARRY. WHAT? I GOT THE TAPE. [LAUGHS] [INDISTINCT] THE TAPE, THE INTERVIEW. OH JESUS, HE'S NEVER GONNA LIVE TO SEE IT. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. IT'S BURNING RIGHT NOW ISNT IT? THE ORGANS, THE MUSCLES, THE BLOOD, THE GREY MATTER. THEY WILL ALL COLLAPSE. YOU'LL DIE. THERE'S A WAY OUT. THERE'S AN ANTIDOTE BACK AT THE LAB. YOU TURN YOURSELF IN YOU CAN LIVE. AND I DISAPPEAR ON THE WAY TO JAIL, RIGHT? JUST LIKE YOU TRIED TO THROW ME OFF THE CLIFF. I DIDN'T DO THAT, ALEX. I'M HERE TO HELP YOU. WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT? WHAT GIVES ME THE RIGHT? I'M A PATRIOT. I LOVE THIS COUNTRY. NOBODY CARES HOW MANY SACRIFICES ARE MADE TO WIN THE WAR. THEY JUST WANT RESULTS. AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA GIVE THEM.

THERE'S A FEW PEOPLE WAITING TO SEE DADDY. MAYBE YOU AND I SHOULD GO AND WAIT OUTSIDE. OKAY. I LOVE YOU, PRINCESS. I LOVE YOU TOO, DADDY. DO I GET A KISS? YESTERDAY A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL TAUGHT HIS COUNTRY A VERY BIG LESSON. ALEX GAINER, THE MAN EVERYONE BRANDED AS A MURDERER TURNED OUT TO BE INNOCENT. AND THE ANIMAL THAT OUR GOVERNMENT SAID HAD TO BE DESTROYED TUNED OUT TO BE A LAMB BEING LED TO SLAUGHTER. IRONICALLY, THE FINAL MOVEMENTS IN THIS GROTESQUE SYMPHONY PLAYED ITSELF OUT RIGHT HERE, IN THIS CITY MALL, A SYMBOL OF AMERICAN CULTURE TODAY. BECAUSE IT'S IN PLACES LIKE THIS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE COME TOGETHER AND TRY TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVES BY BUYING WHATEVER'S OFFERED TO THEM. ALEX GAINER WOULD NOT SETTLE FOR THAT. HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT BUSINESS AS USUAL. AGAINST ALL ODDS, HE STOOD UP FOR WHAT HE BELIEVED IN, AND ALONE HE DREW A LINE AGAINST A FLAGRANT ABUSE OF POWER AND TRUST. A SECOND GRADE SCHOOL TEACHER, A MAN WHO DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO CHILDREN HAS TAUGHT THEM THE ULTIMATE CIVIC LESSON, THAT ONE PERSON ACTING ALONE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND THAT THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS IN THE HANDS OF EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US. I HOPE HE WILL BE AN EXAMPLE TO US ALL. THIS IS HARRY JOHANSEN, ACTION 12 NEWS. AND CUT. AND TAKE IT AWAY.
