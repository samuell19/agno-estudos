The dark specter of the harsh night is invaded by the flickering of the gaslight as it struggles to survive the cold, bloodcurdling blasts of the night winds. The eerie sounds of sirens and the train echoes throughout the city's domain... notifying an uncaring, slumbering jungle of its unwelcome return. Issuing forth from the distant lighted window that now merges into eerie... you will at once bear witness to... well... shall we see for ourselves? No matter how low a man's life has sunk there is still hope for him if he can still look down into the gutter and still locate a fresh, smoldering butt. I suppose you could say there are two ways of looking at everything. You are certainly entitled to your own opinion. Join us, won't you, on the concrete street of rejection and regression... where loneliness and despair mock and ridicule each faltering step... until we finally arrive at the empty haven of unrewarded joy of an unrewarded peak. Or should I say, peep. The stuttering, gleaming lights bring to predominance in the city's night jungle... where the occurring bedevilments of man's ills continue while the bleats and wails attempt to overcome all else. Caged and secluded meek, passive like a wild cat that is slowly being consumed with the basic urge of lust and overpowering passion the desperate, driving need for a woman racks his brain. Where can he go to satisfy this raging force building within him... that threatens to erupt as a volcano about to explode its guts out? With the grace of a prenup ballerina she flits about the stage practicing her art. Despite it all, without too much effort on her part is able to arouse innate desire... lust... passion. When you're in Rome, buddy Joe Sure you do. He always had trouble getting women. He never could figure out how he got to know Margot. You remember her? Of course you do. How could you possibly forget? Do you recall when Joe went to see her for the last time? And we're not gonna have all these dogs here. That dog has to go. And we're not gonna have all these dogs here. That dog has to go. Hey, don't I know you? Oh no, I don't think so. I doubt we frequent the same establishments. Yeah. You look like that creep who lives down by the store with his old lady. Yeah, you're the one. I've seen you before. You and that mother of yours. She'd like to get my ass slammed in the can. I can't stand her, the way she looks. I don't know, you'd better go. Who the hell needs all the trouble you'd be? Oh no, I'm... I'm sure you're mistaken. My mother doesn't even know you. I've seen you, that's true... You're something to look at. Well... Uh, this... where you live... You live here too? Well, what the hell do you think? What do you expect? Some fancy boudoir or something? Listen buster I know broads who work with a bed and a bucket. At least I got a chair. Sit down. Uh, I'd rather stand if you don't mind. The hell, you say... Besides, have you ever tried... Oh, I didn't mean... That's not what I meant. Certainly, if you wish, I'll sit. Oh my, he's a slight one. A regular, visiting fireman. A big, buttered egg man, aren't you honey? I have no need for your tawdry little witticisms. I came here for something... for something other than a conversation. If I have to count off to a cheap... What is it, honey? There, that's better. Don't get all hot and bothered. At least wait until I'm ready. And I'm not ready yet, are you? Oh, I'm ready. I've been ready for a long time. You say you've seen me watch you... I've watched you since you were a little girl in the... school over in the other block. I've grown old watching you. I saw your body fill out I saw your breasts develop I saw that sensuous walk begin and I saw you flaunting yourself at the boys and then the men. I saw you make your first pickup. And I hated you... hated you for what you were doing to yourself and to me. I wanted it to be me. Ready? I'm ready. Hang on, mister, wait just a minute... back off there. Oh, I... I wasn't going to hurt you. I just... I just wanted to talk. I've seen you wearing less than you're wearing now. I've seen the shadows of men fall across the window. And I've wondered what you were... talking about, if you talked and... what went on up here. Oh my god he's one of those. I suppose you wanna know all the terrible things that happen up here. Would you like if I tell you about the first one? Shall I? You wanna know how it happened? Everybody thinks it's young love... Young love, hell... Some dirty old man most of the time that's who it was. You like that, don't you? First time, it was my mother's boyfriend. That's who it was. There's no need to adopt that attitude. I've frightened you and I'm sorry. It's just that... you asked me if I was ready and... Hell mister, you didn't frighten me. I've seen it all before. It's just that... some guys are helpless unless you poke them along a little bit. I thought you might be like that. Okay, come on... Well, if you'd rather not... What do you mean, "if I'd rather not?" You've taken all the poetry out of it, haven't you? There's nothing left where your heart oughta be but a cold cast development. Mister, I've got a living to earn. You're the living. You wanna talk, we talk. You wanna... I wanna. That's the way it is on Belmont Street. You know I've watched you, you said you saw me... Yeah, I've seen you once. I saw you under the streetlight below my window. You looked up. In fact, you might be a peeper. A peeper? A... a window peeper? No. No, I'm... I'm no window peeper. I'm a... a soul watcher, a... a dreamer of faces. I see a face like yours and... I dream a soul to match your face that lustful soul that is yours and I dream that sensuous walk that sudden, swift arch of your back when you turn a corner these I dream, I grew old... dreaming that face was mine. And you, my dear, couldn't care less. Oh, I've dreamed of brains to match that face too full of wits, not cunning... full of the joy of living and loving... I see here a brain sick with the the wasted years and yours... You're as old as I am. What kind of a slob are you? You dirty bastard. Do you know how long I have to listen to your drivel? Do you know how fast I can turn a trick? Man, I don't need to waste this much time on you. You can't even get into bed. Look at you. You're pathetic. You're talking yourself out of the only move you've ever made to get away from that old bag you live with, and act like a man. And all you can do is talk. Come on, take a look at what you're buying. - Take a look! - But, I haven't any desire to... Ha! That's good. He admits he can't get a desire. Ha! Well, you might at least let me finish what I was going to say... Oh, I'm damned. Why don't you finish what you came to do? Stop the talking and find all about life. Oh yeah. I know all about life. You want me to tell you about it? Look at this. Looks soft, doesn't it? Well, it is soft, honey. I know a man who used to go out of his way to prove how soft it was. He used to pay me to cover myself with honey so as to get under the softness under the sweet. Would you like me to dance a little bit for you? I know another guy who used to bring his girlfriend to dance with me. And she could dance. That's right, baby. A girl. That tickled you a little bit, huh? Would you like me to paint more pictures for you? Like the guy who brought the babe? He painted pictures too... all over both of us. You mustn't turn me away. Very well. If you insist. Oh god. What's the matter, honey? What are you waiting for? You're nothing but a miserable freak! I wanted to have you... Is this how they get even? Is this the way they obtain their satisfaction? Or is it revenge alone they want just to torture a man? At least that human boxcar stumbling around up there knows how to treat a man right, Nick. She may not be the best around but she certainly knows how to gratify our desires. Why not admit it, Nick? You've got no one else to turn to. Then there was that seductive, sensuous Sandra. One look at her and you knew she had to be the finest of all our treasures come to life as a breathing entity of flesh and blood. Not blood, but nectar from the gods course through her veins. Sandra arrives in glorious, chauffeured car. One friend casually visiting another... Or is there more to this relationship than meets the eye? Sandra, you've been here before several times. But, never before have you been so acutely aware of those weird, hungry... unnatural looks that almost defy description. Are you now becoming concerned for your safety? And why are you here? Or... are you afraid to answer your true feelings? Against your better judgment you're told to inspire the artist. To enhance the mood so that a more creative result will ensue. So you, of course, respond with fascinating, undulating hip gyrations. Strangely, this motivates unexpected excitement within you. A sensuality that had been dormant in you becomes more and more ardent. Why did Sandra have to turn out that way? Oh, with what she has, why couldn't she have been meant for you? Isn't that what you're thinking, Nick? Why the photos? Is that your plan of escape? The caressing of each picture creates an illusion of fantasy in Nick's mind. The suppression of his passion is weakening. The floodgates will soon no longer be able to stand the torrent of his tormented desires. Los Angeles. The city of innumerable landmarks is renowned for the world's smallest railroad despite its famous displays of the majestic and all its facets of modern civilization. This is the Angels Flight where the sins descends countless times daily where the angels fear to tread. A flight that is incapable of surmounting the plight of our human misery. Where this hill has never budged and bridged the border of the ravage slums with all its potent, stomach turning smells. When each individual's flight to the top of the hill never seems to leave behind his despaired hopes and disillusioned agonies. Nick is no different from all the others. And its thirty second journey of hopeless dejection. Nick wonders, as he scans the rails of the horizon a strange blend of peaceful serenity contrasted by distorted pulsations that seethes beneath its panoramic skyline. This is Nick's introduction to Rhonda. Maidens... into the House of Fetish. The passage of time for Nick has not stopped. Three years of his life has been accumulating in the boudoir of Hilda's room. He has become the paid purveyor of passion and pleasure. Playing the role of gigolo has presented to Nick a way of life that has become weird... sadistic and often masochistic... as you shall soon see. Nick receives strict instructions from his beloved amour to stay out of the amorous clutches of any young maiden that might possibly stray into their bountiful love nest while she attends to matters of a personal nature for the evening. You find in minutes dragging into unendurable hours. At last, the eagerly anticipated sound. Toni, the tempestuous Toni. She, who has eluded you for so long. Toni. Transforms your passion into a raging, maddening fury. The craving for her curvaceous body seethes in your every pore. Her teasing only tantalizes you even more, but... maybe... maybe she isn't just teasing you. Maybe, at the last minute... she's given you the cold shoulder... the brush-off. At this moment, you hope these animals of the bedroom jungle annihilate each other. If only they would, so you would no longer have an excuse to stay out. You would feel this house of fetish is like a grave of quicksand devouring you alive. I can't stand you. Will you get away from me? For god's sakes, leave me alone. Will you leave me alone? If only you'd leave me alone. Finally, you assume you are free. Around and around it goes. But you soon must stop where you left off. Freedom is only a spinning optical illusion and must come to a motionless halt. There is really no difference between the merry-go-round and the downward journey on Angels Flight. The one goes around and around the other goes up and down. But they both drop you off where once your miserable existence began only lower than before. Is life, with all of its infinite dilemmas and manifestations, more real than these masks that we pose so breathlessly? Perhaps these faces, shaped and moulded by human hands, are relieved to permit life, to ruthlessly parade by into eternity. The young life braves its initial existence, head erect, confident, supreme, issuing forth and accepting challenges from any source. No one and no thing can meet or defeat him... or he so truly determines. Eventually before comprehension can take effect, the suffocating tentacles of the pulsating aging process slowly encircles its prey. The stifling, chocking, entwines its trapped victim. The defenseless hero becomes surrounded and engulfed by the ravages of the timeless deterioration that chips and cuts away with fearless abandon. Ceaselessly, showing no mercy until the total and complete destruction spells the end. The end, bearing the cloak of mercy. The final, carefully dotted period punctuated by the slashing, gouging of the human clause infested with its poisonous venom. ...many big mergers resulted today include medicine and consolidated gas.
