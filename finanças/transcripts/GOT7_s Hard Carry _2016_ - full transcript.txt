[This program contains indirect advertising] ["M2" was wondering] [If GOT7 could] ["Hard Carry" just like their song title?] [So we asked them in person] [If GOT7 was to do a reality show, what do they want to do?] [GOT7 wants!] [For fans!] [For members!] [More than... (anything...)] [Grand dream of these idols!] [Will their dreams come true?] [We began upon their wish] [Hard Carry List #0] [GOT7's own reality] [Episode 0 Launching show] [GOT7's "Hard Carry" finally started] [Starting with Lim the leader and whole GOT7 gathered at a place] One, two, three. [With a formal ribbon cutting ceremony, they inform the whole world of their start!] [Preparing a surprise quiz for fans] Hurry up and write, guys. - Do I write my own? - Yes. [Writing their own Hard Carry list] [Will I GOT7 guess which member wrote which list...?] - Yours is too obvious, Jin Young. - What do you mean? Your writing tells that it's you. I can tell that a smart person wrote this. [If I draw worms, they wouldn't know it's me...] If I write fencing, it's too obvious. If you write fencing then people would think it's me. [That's what you think. They wouldn't] [Upset] Then don't. Paint ball. What do you call paint ball? In Korean? [Play paint ball] I feel burdened. We're doing the reality show that fans wated but I'm worried if we'll meet their expectation. This is what we wanted. We're doing this because we want to and we work together but that's what makes me feel more burdened. I'm sure fans will know who wrote what. Totally? There's a pattern. Fans know our patterns. What do you think is so obvious? This. Everyone can tell Youngjae wrote this. Is this Yugyeom? Right? Yugyeom's writing is weird. [Finished decoding members' writings] Three cameras are filming me... I feel like I'm a star. - Let's go down. - Let's begin. [GOT7 are entering towards the reality show] [Giving a Hard Carry list quiz] [Water sports, skydiving, learn how to cook] [Whose Hard Carry list is this?] - Shall we reveal? - Shall we? One, two, three. It's me. Fans are so smart. Number 1, play avatar in Myeong-dong. [Anyone can tell who wrote this list] [BamBam raises his hand] [Whose list is the next one?] [It's me] One, two, three. [Finished revealing last number 7, Yugyeom's list] [Please look forward which member will Hard Carry] [One morning in September in Sinsa-dong, Gangnamgu] [Saying hi in a swollen face] - Hello. - Hello. [GOT7 including Lim the leader are all here!] [I'm dragged to the camera] [Boyfriend getting ready for work] [GOT7 getting ready] [BamBam likes it] [Are you filming me?] I'm not used to this. It's my first time. They suit you. [Jackson looks good with everything] These are good too. What do you think of these, Mark? [Firm Mark] [Speaking a foreign language] [About to get a picture for life] [Very serious] [Light bulb boyfriend, BamBam] It looks nice. It'll look better if I edit it. As you see, ladies and gentlemen, the quality of our reality show is upgraded. [Also, my look is upgraded] [Leaves looking cool with a curious tongue gesture] [Hard Carry list #2] [Title shooting is Hard Carry too] [Pink, black suits, GOT7, cakes] [What are we shooting today?] It's the first shooting of our reality show. [Grand title shooting for "Hard Carry" today!] [GOT7's Hard Carry] The leader is being late. [What happened to JB?] [JB keeps looking outside the window] [JB's sentimental because of fall] Why is JB not coming? - He was drinking coffee... - He has different reasons all the time. - Sometimes washroom... - He was like... [Actor Mark dramatizing] Oh my god. [Power idol look] [Very handsome brother] [This coffee is pretty good...] [Mark wondering around eating gimbap] [Everyone's almost ready for the title shooting] Oh my god. I spilled coffee on my clothes. [It must be a dream] [Please say this isn't happening!] - Does this time make sense to you? - Pretty much. I guess we look easy to him. [Losing fear upon wearing sunglasses] - I called him older brother because I respect him. - Call him now. - Call him now. - We were both born in 1994. JB was born early in 1994. I was born in 1994. But I still call him older brother. But you were born in March. - I was being polite. - March. - He's only a month and a half older. - Call him. Don't stop me. I'm going to get upset at him. [Jackson's anger is getting boom boom] [Why did I drink coffee?] [Why isn't the shirt coming...] - He's not polite at all. - I know. [Surprised!] [Jackson is frightened!] - Why did you look? - Your expression changes so easily. I thought he was here. [Back to the emotion] Let's make him show his talent, no, act cute. Okay. *Have a sweet dream. *[Acting cute by making short tongue sound] I dreamed. I dreamed of you. [The shirt is finally here] [JB, the hot icon of the other floor, is on the way!] [Only one person is nervous with the sound of footstep] [Jackson got up with a fork?] [Tension] Hey, brother! Brother! The cake is ready. [Brave people are gone and only soulless applause left] Try the cake first. [Everyone is focused on Jackson] We've been waiting for a long time. Thank you all in advance. Jackson looks like a bodyguard. [With Jackson's overflowing love, the title shooting begins!] [Whole GOT7 marches. The title shooting starts!] [Each of them shows their best look and get ready] [GOT7, meet up around the cake!!] [Selfie time] [Make a pose] [V] [BamBam fooling around] [Dance friends giving eye contact] [Excited] [Explosive cute look] [Getting excited] [Disarmed as they do] [United dance of two friends] [Everyone is busy getting ready for the next shooting...] You shouldn't get upset. I didn't feel good since the morning. JB keeps being late... He's not here, is he? [Bursts into laugh] [JB appears just in time] What? What? Don't say anything bad about JB. Someone told us that he was mad in the morning because you were late. Seriously... He's wearing some nice looking sunglasses. [You know that it's not me, right?] - Sorry. - It's fine. People can be late. No, I shouldn't be late. - It's fine for leaders to be late. - I wasn't late because I wanted to. I know. Because you were not careful, you spilled coffee. Am I wrong? [Giving eye contact] [Don't know what to do because it's true] [On the other hand, Mark holding a camera himself] Are you ready? [Start shooting Hard Carry song "Skyway"] [Warm] [At the end of JB's warm eyes, 4 people are acting cute] [I'm watching you] [Why can't you tell them to do it together?] [Proceeds to the standing area from the master bedroom] [No one cares] [Look of a parent at a kindergarten party] [Still no one cares] [Hey, kids, let your dad join...] [Youngjae sleeping like an old man] Hey. Hey. Hey, get up. You shouldn't sleep here. Hey, you should start shooting. [GOT6 getting ready for something] [Meeting to make fun of Youngjae] [Checking if Youngjae is up] I'll start with this. Throw a grenade. No.Try this, Pokemon. - Pokemon. - Come out, Youngjae. [Fails to summon Aerodactyl Youngjae!] [Actor Mark] [Shoots a poisoned needle] [Keeps sleeping] [A son who found his dad in 7 years] Father. Oh what? [Dad wakes up feeling his son's sorrow] [Emotional act all broke into pieces] [Jackson's morning drama finishes early] [First personal shooting member, Yugyeom] [Thank you in advance] I'm usually the first one to get ready. It's better to get it done and over with. Fighting. [I'm the youngest of GOT7] [Second member, BamBam] [So passionate to bring his own perfume] [Worth 100 screen captures] Which member do you think will be the best? - I think BamBam... - I was about to say that too. BamBam has this. He's good at hypnotizing himself. I'm hot. [I'm hot...] [I'm the hottest in the whole universe...] [BamBam finishes shooting with compliments] [So embarrassed that he's not taking care of himself] Am I the best? But there was only one person before me. Good job. It was fun. Don't they look too good? I didn't expect them to be so good. [Face genius Park Jin Young] [Mistaken him for a suit model...] [Actor Park giving melodramatic eyes] So handsome. Actor Park. [Finishes shooting in seconds] [Youngjae feels 777% more burdened] I'm done for. What should I do? I can't hold laughing. [Biggest challenge of today's shooting title!] [Hard Carry without laughing!] [Try to look hot no matter what!] It's embarrassing. [All members are fighting with laughter] [Youngjae, the biggest ambush] How come even that look like a show off? [Showing off] Look. Something's running around outside. [Unidentified things running around] BamBam, Yugyeom and [What is that?] JB are running and the bodyguard is running after them. Mom, I'll be home soon. Get my meal ready. Hello? Mom. [We'll reveal in a second why they are running!] - So fast. - Funny. [The person with light mouth] [Calm down, my gums] [Clenches] [Seems he's holding it well but...] [Write it's a title shooting but read that it's Youngjae's extreme experience...] It feels like an extreme experience... You didn't expect the shooting to be like this, did you? If I didn't know what was going on, I would look very hot. But because we filmed funny look first, this looks a bit weird. [One more dark horse appears] Is that what other people did? [Already funny] Should I just try to look cool? Don't laugh and act like it's a magazine shooting. [Magazine shooting... Already lost confident] [Think something sad...] [Yes... Think of something sad...] [I think I'm done, Youngjae...] [Tries to hide his mouth] [JB finally finishes shooting!] [On the other hand, Mark holds his smile! Working hard to look good!] [But one big ordeal comes to him...] [That is, "Use the mist attractively"] [Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!] [Smiles wide as soon as he receives OK] [This isn't a cosmetic ad] [Shall we appreciate his face for a second?] I'm not a very charismatic person. [King Jackson is coming] [Charismatic] [Hold a bottle out of no where] [Already gave up on looking cool... Tries to be funny] I don't have a clock. - Am I done? - Yes. - Good job. - Good job. Thank you. [Personal shooting ends even for Jackson] [Lastly, group shooting begins] [What dance will they present?] [Starts with the winner of "Hit The Stage"] [Everyone falls with every move of Yugyeom] [Heart attack] [Jin Young passed out] [Youngest Yugyeom's dance continues] [When the youngest dances in the center] [When the leader dances in the center] [Do not follow] [Venting his anger as if he's dancing] [Yugyeom the trance] [Jin Young's series of random dance] [New I GOT7 may cover your eyes] I get fearless with the sunglasses. [Puts on magical sunglasses] [Let's get this party started] He's getting ready. He's getting ready. [Youngjae's SHOW!] [Youngjae so excited today] [I am famous Youngjae] [Group shooting ends with Youngjae's Hard Carry] [Hard Carry song "Skyway"] I'll shoot you real nice. [Sings in a raw voice] [Angry hose attack] [Interlude] Come here. Let's run, all three of us. [Youngjae hates this scene] Skyway. [He's been to mineral spring] [The end] [Hard Carry list #3] [Visit a famous restaurant. GOT7! Bear the weight of waiting!] How do you feel? I'm imagining our upcoming embarrassing moments. I think it'll be the most embarrassing moment of my life. We're heading to the entrance of embarrass. Please! How can we do this? I'm embarrassed. [What will Hard Carry that members will do facing the shame for life time?] Show your hot pose please. [Is this enough?] So cute. We had this in New York. Right. Everyone is looking at us. [Where are they heading to in black suits?] [Are they going to line up in that outfit?] [Curious! GOT7!] [Why are they in a Gangnam restaurant] [full of people even in the morning?] [Yugyeom wants to visit good restaurants] [The first member of Hard Carry] [Yugyeom is in!] [It's even more shameful to be here...] This is very embarrassing, ladies and gentlemen. It can't be any worse than this in life. Put on your sunglasses please. If you wear sunglasses... It will be less embarrassing. [Puts on magical sunglasses] I want to go in now. I want to leave now. Hey, Yugyeom and Youngjae. Since we're embarrassed anyway, whoever loses rock paper scissors do something here. [BamBam's provocative suggestion] Just once. Just once. We should, as GOT7. [Planning even though they said they don't want to] [So serious for nothing...] [Common look of idols of the period doing rock paper scissors in middle of Gangnam] [The die is cast! Who will be penalized?] [And...?] [Jackson & Mark lost!] [I won!!!!] Rock paper scissors. Rock paper scissors. [Jackson loses] It suits you. [Entered the burger store] What will you do? I'm sorry to interrupt everyone. GOT7 is here. Some people don't know us. GOT7 is a boy group in JYP. Our new album is released. The name of the album is "Hard Carry". [Claps to Jackson] Thank you. We are sorry. That was so great, Jackson. [Providing fan services] I'm taking photo alone. Hello. We are number 77. [Sit and ready to eat] What do you think about what Jackson just did? - It was the best. - He was great. I think it was very nice. [Jackson is praised] [Finally they got the burgers and fries] GOT7. [Eating show, Hard Carry, LET'S GO] [To be continued] [Go, as if you never had a manager] [Their cameras are suddenly turned on] Everyone. It's dawn. We will go down first. It's 4:50am right now. We need to get to the airport by ourselves. [Hard Carry by GOT7] [Get to the airport without manager!!] [Divided in three teams] [Can they all get to the airport?] I found the way to get to the airport. I found it. Jackson still doesn't know about it. What? You will see. [Mark & Jin Young departing to the airport] [The door closed on him] I chose something that I've never got into in my life. - What? - You will see. - Where are we going? - We need to take a taxi first. [Jackson is not satisfied] [Jackson & BamBam need to get a taxi] It's so quiet. [Happy with the morning air] People would be wondering what we are doing right now. It's 4am in the morning. Even the sky is not awake. But we are awake. We are walking. [Visual team chose to go by the airport bus] You can get the airport bus near here. That's good. [Praising the airport bus] The bus goes straight to the airport. [Other teams are taking the subway, and car] I invited a guest. [JB & Youngjae & Yugyeom] We can get there in comfort. [Very close friend of JB!] We are very close. We once had a fight because of basketball. Let's go. [Who came for JB?] Hard Carry. [From dormitory to the company] It's Jin Young's birthday today. Thank you everyone. It's my birthday today. Turn left from here. [Handsome faces] [Successfully checked the bus!] There is a bus in every 15 to 30 minutes. - It's 23 now. - We have 15 minutes. - Shall we go to cafe? - Just for a moment? Mark is going to buy me a coffee, since it's my birthday today. [Missed to tell the size] I'm not going to drink much. [Two tall sizes] We are on the way to the airport. Jin Young's fashion today. You asked me what to wear today. - You are wearing what I told you to. - Yes. - Exactly as you told me. - You weren't going to wear your cap. [Mark follows the order] [I GOT7 doesn't like caps that cover handsome face] Don't you like it? [Thanks to Jin Young, who got rid of the cap] [Sweater holes that stimulate your imagination] - It's got holes. My jeans have holes as well. Your parents might not like it. [I GOT7 like stripes very much] To the bus stop. [Morning coffee makes you happy] It feels good. Jin Young's fashion today. [Dandy style] [Wide pants + Basic white t-shirt + Clean denim jacket] There is a decoration on the sleeve. You can say that our fashion today is matched. Do you know what I mean? [Talking about something else] [Matched color that present I GOT7] The official color of GOT7 is green. I feel relaxed. Everyone. Taxi. [Jackson doesn't care about anything.] Hello. To Gongduk, please. Hello. This is BamBam and Jackson of GOT7. - Thai. - Chinese. We are JackBam. [Jackson reporter leading the conversation.] Boast five things about yourself. That's too small. When I went to Thailand for the first time, after the debut... 8 thousand people were waiting for me at the airport. Really. How can you brag about yourself? It's your turn now. I was the best fencing player in the Asia. That's too much. 2 years after the debut, I bought a house for my mother. I'm sorry. - Bragging about yourself. - You are good at it too. I won the new entertainer's prize in 2014. [They are drunk to boast about themselves] Five is too many. I'm sorry that we are too loud, driver. [Never ending boast battle] I bought a car for my little sister. [Feeling great] This is really... Bragging... I'm sure that you can't wait for your turn. You are like "I want to talk more". You have lot of thing to talk about. I can't speak multiple languages. Thai. Chinese. English. I've been saying this for three years. - I don't have anything. - Don't lie. Hurry up. It's your turn. It's not about me, but it's about GOT7. The 12 thousand seats for GOT7 concert... was completely full two times. If I say "thank you", you will be like "no". This is our power, the power of GOT7. [Put down battle of Jackson & BamBam] Jackson... doesn't look as good as me in terms of fashion. That's too much. Why did you hit me? Why would you put me down, and hit me? Hurry up. I'm ready. I'm so happy that we are popular in Thailand, because of BamBam. No. Are you making me a fool? We are getting off the car. [Where did Jackson & BamBam arrive?] [JB's very close friend is here] How do you fight because of basketball? He's a great man. I will show who that is. He's here. [Man with great vibe] [The bad dancer] Don't call me like that. I'm not one of your family member anymore. What do you mean? The one you are seeing is... [Shy suddenly...] - Going to Incheon? - Get in. You are so nice. [Departing to Incheon airport] [Jackson got off the taxi, without knowing anything] [BamBam tells to go by subway, after 30 minutes of departing] Going by subway? [BamBam wants to suffer] It's been six years since I came to Korea. I've never got in to a subway. Because you are rich. I always used subways. The bus is here. [Handsome people getting on the bus] [Handsome guys on the back seat] - I wonder how the others are doing. - Safety first. [Putting on the seat belt] [Looks like it's their first time on the bus] The last time I got on the bus is when I was a trainee. Really? It's been so long. When I went for martial arts lesson, when I was a trainee. I got a bus with number 4318. [They are so familiar with that number] [How about bus 143?] - I used subway two days ago. - Why? Jin Young's been going to university by bus. It's my first time going to work without my manager. I've never thought about it. It's not so hard. Getting on the bus is too easy. Who do you think will suffer the most today? [Mark said "BamBam & Jackson"] I think they are going to miss the plane. I'm the issue producer. I'm so ill. I make the atmosphere go higher, wherever I go. It's too loud, outside the plane. [New way to show arm] It's too loud, outside the plane. This is what my team is like. Nobody is normal. There are so many people here. [BamBam is in the subway for the first time.] [They have to check the map first.] Follow me. - We need to look for the airport. - You don't know anything. Have you ever been to subway before? Do you know what suffering is? Do I need to buy the ticket? [BamBam ignores Jackson] Just do as what I say. [Proficiently buys the ticket] Ticket purchased. You are very good. [Why can't you go in...] Okay. [Successfully got on the subway] You should come to JYP NATION. You have another reason to come to JYP NATION. I will look like I have nothing to do. [They are having fun, teasing him] I think you are a beautiful couple. You've seen her from long time ago. [He's smiling, talking about that person.] She always tell me not to act like a boss, when I'm with you guys. - Who? - Her. [Fell in talking about his girlfriend] I'm older. Do you remember this? [Looks like JB has something to say.] We were all together. I'm not sure if it was Seoul or Japan. AM people and PM people. [When Jinwoon was the youngest] Older people called the youngest. Called the youngest. [Jinwoon held onto my neck and said] I'm not the youngest anymore. They are the youngest now. He said that, as he shake my neck. [He was so happy that he was not the youngest anymore.] Do you know how happy I was? That I'm not the youngest. I was so happy that there was someone younger than me. Play the song please. ["Hard Carry" for Jinwoon] [His face is changed as soon as the music is played] I would have danced if I wasn't driving. [He wants to dance very much.] Only if I wasn't driving. [His heart is already dancing.] This is hard to resist. Should I stop the car? [It was dangerous.] [Yugyeom plays a song.] I like this song too. [HA:TFELT - "Ain't Nobody"] [Teasing Jinwoon is not finished yet.] [Being teased, when he came to help them out] I was stimulated after listening to this album. Did she produce this song by herself in America? [The bad dancer became gentle.] [Surprised] [No, my hand!] [Going to listen to the full song.] [Found the camera!] [Frustrated] [Fell in the lyric] This part is really good. He suddenly turn it off. Because we have arrived. I think your face became really red... compared to when I first met you today. No way. I'm wearing a makeup. [Their faces look like they are working.] [Shining] We are here. What do we do? Goodbye. We are here earlier than expected. It's 6:30. I got a call from Jin Young. Where are you, Yugyeom? - We are on the way. - We are here. - Have you arrived already? - Why did you get there so early? - Jin Young. - How are you? I love you. Don't confess your love so suddenly. I read the news article. I'm shy. [This stop is Incheon International Airport.] Hey, it was good trip. [Arrived to Incheon Airport] [Didn't forget to say "thank you"] Hello. How have you been? I didn't know getting on the subway is so hard. I heard you came by subway and bus. - What are you going to do? - I'm going home. I should have asked to Jin Young Park PD to take me. [Successfully arrived to airport without manager] Look at the bright sky. This is life. [GOT7 got on the plane to Bangkok.] [Arrived in Bangkok] [Thai fans welcoming] [Welcome, GOT7] [This is Hard Carry] [They are the same people.] [Harry Carry is continued in Thailand.] [Deep inside their heart is opened.] [Night in Thailand full of exposure and wound] [Curious about Hard Carry of BamBam in Thailand?] Have you been waiting so long?
