Tokyo New Cinema 11th Film I get scared whenever my phone rings. I get breathless... My heart... How should I describe it? My heart tightens up all of a sudden. There's this throbbing feeling. It was a phone call from the police. They just asked my name. Then about my relationship with Saeko Ninomiya. I had no idea what was happening at the time. We were childhood friends, and always went to the same schools. Welcome. You must be heartbroken about something. You must be heartbroken about something! You weren't your usual self the other day, so I've been worried about you. When I was on my way to work, I saw you walking out of the school. I got worried, so I ditched work and followed you. I'm sorry. I lost my brother when I was in middle school. He was 4 years older than me and a freshman in college at the time. I adored him, and I always tried to follow his footsteps. I still find it hard to believe that he passed away in an accident. Why are you telling me this? I thought something heartbreaking must have happened to you. That's why I... Thank you. You don't have to... But I'm sorry. I don't know how you feel. I may be able to understand, but I can't feel it. Your brother, who I have never met, may have died, but no matter how painful it was for you, it's not the kind of pain I can feel. I... I lost something irreplaceable, the one and only true friend I've ever had. We may not have been related by blood, but her life meant something very special to me. That's why I think... you must be a kind person, so you tried to console me. That's why you told me about your brother... but I'm sorry. That's still... something that doesn't concern me. I don't think that would make me feel better in the slightest. Of course. I'm sorry. I wasn't being very considerate about your feelings. I should be the one to apologize. Good morning. Good morning. Thanks again. You're welcome. Thank you. What would you like for next week? Set A will be a lot cheaper starting next week. I haven't decided yet. Can I order by phone? Yes, all right. Your receipt. Good-bye. Thank you. See you. Yes, hello? Yes. All right. Okay, I'll head over there now. Mr. Yamaguchi at District 2, correct? Why are you drinking Yebisu beer when I'm drinking low-malt beer? Pay us back if you've got that kind of money. Sorry. You're just a damn student, don't act like an entrepreneur! I'm sorry! I hate people like you the most! I'll pay you back! I'll pay you back, okay? I'll pay you back! It's already been decided. I can't live without my restaurant. Like I care! That's your damn problem! Maybe we can sell her. Like hell you are! Have my money to me by next week. I'll let the cops know about you, if you're late even by a day. I don't care if you have to sell your sister. That Indian guy's sister was pretty hot. By the way, you have a sister too, right? Does she look like you? Is she pretty? Hello, it's the Bento Club delivery for... Did you ring the bell? I'm sorry for making you wait. Oh no, it's all right. One Set-A, right? Yes. Please sign right here. How was my piano earlier? It was wonderful. Um... My mother used to hum that song... It was Rachmaninoff Symphony No. 2 in E minor, Op. 27 I'm performing in a private concert soon. Please attend if you're interested. Here's your receipt. Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me! Yes? Um... is your grandma home? May I ask who you are? Can we come in and have a little chat with her? Please pay back what you owe us. Leave, loan sharks. Lady... We notified you many times, and we called you, too. You're the one not paying us back. Just sell this dump. Please leave. If you keep bothering her, I'll call the police! Are we the ones who don't want cops to be involved? What do you think? It's close by. I went there yesterday, but the girl was so ugly. You'll make good money there. Leave! We want the best for you. Work there, and you can pay us back in 3 months. Hold on, hold on... Let's get going. We'll be back. What a stubborn old hag. How much would you pay for her? You'd pay a lot, right? Could be a lot depending where you go. Like maybe in Gotanda? Have you been to Gotanda? Those girls could... This is the Bento Club, right? Yes. Is Natsuki Shigyo here? I'm Natsuki Shigyo. You've got a father, right? Huh? I used to work with your dad before. Well, we're sort of friends. I think he should just drop dead. Yeah, he's such a lowlife. Don't worry though, he'll probably die soon anyway. He's a total alcoholic now. He can't do anything by himself now. He's jobless, too. Apparently, his 20,000 yen a month public housing rent is also piling up. The water's warm. I couldn't care less about what happens to him. Come on, you're the only family he's got. You should see him every once in a while. He did this to me when I was only three years old. My very first memory is my father burning me with a cigarette. He got drunk and beat me and my mother. My mother was a kind, earnest woman. She endured all the pain to make my life better. Unfortunately, she ended up with that sad excuse for a man, and died when I was 10, from stress Yet he walked away from the funeral with another woman! My uncle took me in, and I managed to survive up to this day. How can I possibly consider that bastard as a father now?! Man, that's tough. Cover that up. Whoa, hold on... Don't come back here. You won't see me again. You're scaring me. Don't ever mention him to me again. Bye. Hey! Yes? You didn't come here just because you thought I wanted to know, right? What do you want? Well, I lent him 30,000 yen. I'm definitely not getting it back from him so I thought I'd find his daughter... Did you actually think I'd pay?! No, I know. What is it? Here, I'll pay you never to come back again. I don't want to see you again. Thanks. Hey, wait. Wait. What? Hey, hey... You got a pen and something to write on? He lives here. I don't want it. You can keep hating him, but it'll feel easier to forgive. My sole purpose in life is to hate him. You'll never understand. Looks like the Indian guy committed suicide. The little sister is here. It's hot in here. Here, drink some tea. It'll cool you down. Man, we were lucky. We would've been screwed if an ordinary citizen died on us. Right, that'd be best. You should go back to your country. I'll kill you! Do you want me to call the police?! Who do you think will get in trouble? Natsuki! You don't have to run from me. You quit from the bookstore without telling me, and won't pick up my calls... But I'm glad you're doing well. How can you tell I'm doing well? You haven't changed. So you married that professor's daughter? Yeah. The professor always looked after me. I want you to find happiness, too. That's exactly what I started to hate about you. I wonder if things would've been different if you gave birth to that baby. Don't act like you actually care. Why the hell are you here? What do you want?! Leave! Go home! Why are you here? Shut up. What's your problem? You wanna die? Open up! Why are you here? What are you doing? Shut up. Who are you? Stop! What are you doing?! Hey! Hey, let me out! Let me out! Hey! I'll kill you! Let me out! Open the door! Let me out! Hey, what are you trying to do? Hey! Open the door! What the hell are you trying to do here?! Leave! What do you think you're doing? Go away! Why did you come back after all this time? Shut up! Leave! Stop, you bastard! Cut it out! Shut the hell up. You're totally addicted to speed now, huh? I'm gonna live here from now on. Got it? If you do that, I'll chop your head off. Go ahead. I want to die soon, too. Just like you do. It's me! I'm your daughter, Natsuki Shigyo. Open up, you bastard! You're buying cigarettes when you haven't paid a single cent for child support? Living it up, huh? I hear this place is known for suicides. Someone jumps off every year, right? Is it fun living the way you do now? I'll never forgive you. I'll never, ever forgive you. For my mother, too. I'll live here. Living with you will be the best revenge I'll get. I'm looking forward to it, Dad. I really don't need dinner. I rented a DVD. Which one did you rent? Heidi, Girl of the Alps. Huh? Asuka, I remember you really liked that anime, right? Don't you remember? Dinner's ready. Eat up. I keep telling you this, but I decided not to eat before work. But you work 'till morning. It's fine. It's bad for your health! Don't just show up and act like a parent. You haven't changed at all. A lot of people don't bother cooking at home, even something this simple. Although, I'm just getting leftovers from work, too. Mom made better meat & potatoes. Did you love her? Why did you decide to have me? Tell me why. I... loved your mother. You're the one who made her life miserable. I've been wondering... how I can become a good parent... Don't ever say something like that in front of me again. Oh, the laundry. Can't you do anything around here? Asuka, are you awake? We're leaving home. I don't wanna. It's hot. I want to introduce you to someone. Here, dress up for the event. Look at the time. Hurry and get ready. Say something. It's my day off... Remember going to the zoo? Yeah. Who's this guy? This guy works under me. He has a very promising future. He's training to become an executive for a financial firm. As your brother, I'd like you to find an honest and talented man like him. You definitely made up about the talented part. He is. No way. He is! No way! He really is... Just look at him. What's the problem? Remember this song? The song Mom liked. What was it called? Hey, what is it exactly you want from me? I don't understand why you decided to just show up at my place. We're family. We should be together. Why now? You're the one who abandoned us and barely even made a phone call. I had to take care of the old man by myself. He went senile and grabbed onto me when I was asleep. Do you have any idea how disgusting and miserable my life was when I was in high school? We only have each other now! You're not making any sense. It's just that things weren't the way it should've been before. At least quit taking drugs. Stop hanging out with those people. Let's start getting our lives back on track. Quit your current job... You're beautiful and you've got good proportions! Become an actress. I'll find work for you! That's absurd. Where are you going? There's a party at my friend's place. Don't go! You used to like monkeys, right? I did? Sorry. Looks like there's some kind of trouble at work, so I have to go. Swallow it. Next time. I'm just playing around. My body is all you want from me? What about you? My drugs are all you want from me? Don't be silly. What are you doing?! We're leaving. Asuka is here by choice. Ever heard of free will? Am I wrong? There's no way Asuka is having fun hanging around with scum like you! Let's go. What are you doing?! Hey, old man! You gonna hit me? You've got guts for a little gangster Yuki's father is a lawyer. He's also well-connected with cops. If Yuki filed a complaint, a bum like you would end up straight in jail. Fight back if you dare. I can send you straight to jail. Do you know what she was like when she was little? She's my sister, so I know. I'm a sad excuse for a human being, Asuka... isn't a girl who should hang around with scums like you or do drugs! Dance. Then you two can go back to your happy lives. Keep moving! Take off your shirt! Let's see you move! Enough already. Let's go. Move over. Don't let this happen again Yes. We'll make sure it doesn't happen again. I'm so sorry for disturbing you. Thank you for your time. Why didn't you turn off the water? Is that how you try to help out? I forgot. Why are you drinking? No... No? You're drinking right now! Wait... Where did you get the money? I'm so confused. We're strangers, right? You spent a stranger's money without permission to get drunk? Sorry. I'm not your daughter anymore! Come here! No, wait... Come! Natsuki! Natsuki! Don't go... You're not going, right? You won't leave, right? Stop that! Don't go... Stay h... Let me go! You make me sick! Ow. Ow... Hey, what were you thinking? I'm serious! Rachmaninoff Symphony No. 2 in E minor, Op. 27 I want to buy this camera to permanently record you and the shop. How can we possibly afford such an expensive camera? It's my goal. Just a goal. This one is nice, too. What do you think about this one? You showed up. I was very moved by your performance. Thanks. It made me envy people who have music in their lives. I used to dance ballet. We didn't have much money, so I only went once a week, but my mother didn't want me to quit, so she let me continue dancing That's great. But I just enjoy it. I can't express myself properly like you... You're on a whole other level. Anyone can express themselves. Wait here. Wait just for a while. You can have this. Please shoot whatever you like. Capture what really matters to you. No, I can't keep something so expensive... Oh, no. It's not. Actually, I bought a new one today. It'd be a waste if nobody used it. Why? You the loan shark, right? I don't know why you came, but did you think that I would be happy by this? I don't want your pity. I know I'm weak, but I'll be more miserable being pitied by someone like you. Even though we might be poor, we are not ashamed by it. Yet, I'm frustrarted. We don't need this. We decided to sell the store. We will return the debt, so please don't come back again. What's the matter? Bento Club delivery. Sorry. Two Set-C's, correct? Please sign here. Here. Thanks. Thank you very much. Our lunch is here. Drinking so early in the morning? You're hopeless. Are you hungry? Quit your job. Get a serious job. Says a low rank gangster. I'm being serious here. I'm exhausted! Let me sleep. Maybe you can open a tofu shop. Find an honest career like that. What? A tofu shop? Are you dumb? There are girls your age out there, who take their lives seriously and make an honest living, no matter how hard things get. Do I look like I don't take my life seriously? Clearly! Why did I have to be born as your child? Anyone could've been my father. Then I may have went to university and had a nice boyfriend. I might have continued ballet, and I have been good and impressed all my friends. Friends... What are friends, anyway? Why did you have me, anyway? Did you love mom when you knocked her up? Not that it matters, though! Hey... answer me. Hey, answer me! Say something. Sorry... Sorry doesn't cut it! Sorry. Hit me. Hit me like you used to. Everything you abandoned... All the burden you left behind had to be carried by a high school student like me! I thought I was finally free, but I have no money or work. Then I fell for a pathetic man. Still, I try to take my life seriously! What kind of a fool takes life seriously and still does drugs?! Screw you! What? Are you finally ready to hit me? Let's see you slap me like you used to. Let's see you burn me with a cigarette like you used to! Please hit me more. You idiot! This is so ridiculous! You disgust me. Do you think that will undo everything you did? this address? I don't know! An apartment north of the station, just outside the shopping district. It's an ordinary apartment building! It shouldn't take long! I can't wait anymore! You disgust me! What are you doing? Stop! Get out of here! Are you out of your mind?! Are you okay, Pops? Why the hell are you here?! I came to check up on you! Pops... Stay still. The cut wasn't deep, so she'll be all right, but try not to get too emotional. Also... Hey! He's fast asleep, so he'll be fine. I'm coming down there now. I've never seen our parents. You've seen them, right? I barely did. I don't remember anything about them. Why did they decide to have us? Well... uh... I guess we were the ones who decided to be born... as an outcome. Was it nothing more than sexual urges? That'd be sad, huh? It beats having someone telling us it's love and all that nonsense. Then you'd have to be thankful to them. You're right. Thanks for saving me. Take him away with you. I might end up killing him. I have to think about my own life. My daughter's three, and my son's about to turn one. How can I bring an old guy like him home? You have kids? I'm broke with lots of kids. Well, maybe he would rather have you kill him than stay with me. That's how I would think. What's this? Actually, I never lent him any money. Sorry. I found work, though. You thief! I feel bad about unloading him on you. Huh? Please don't beat him. I know how you feel, but please. Why are you pleading for him? He was like a father to me. He would invite me for drink sometimes. He was... the only man who ever did things like that for me. What kind of a man was he? There was this clumsy young guy where I used to work. He got into an accident at work, and became disabled. But the company refused to pay compensation since it wasn't in the contract. Your old man hit the boss for that, and he was fired. After that, we went to a bar, and he said... "A Japanese man robbed of the chance to commit seppuku can only follow the way of the Samurai by standing up again" out of the blue. Samurai... He was just a devil incarnate in my eyes. I can imagine. I wanted to give you this, too. It was on the fridge the first time I went to his place. He said it was a portrait of him drawn by his daughter. That's how I found out about you. How creepy. You can keep hating him, but it'll feel easier to forgive. You're so dumb. It's excruciating because I don't hate him. Hey! You're stupid just like him! No wonder you call him "Pops!" Hello, is this Natsuo Serizawa's phone number? Are you Natsuki Shigyo? Uh, well... I don't know how to break it to you, but... This morning, your sister... This morning, your father... was found dead. We believe it is caused by drug overdose. Most likely by his own hand... Hey, wake up! Hey! Hey? Wake up! Wake up! Hey! Doctor? Why is he still sleeping? Doctor... It doesn't make any sense! What's happening? It makes no sense! Hey! Wake up now! Wake up, damn it! Hey! Are you going to die? Is he dead? You're not, right? Wake up... Don't just die on me! What do you know about Asuka? Do you know why she works at a red light district?! It's all your fault! She's been working so hard to save some money to buy a house so she can start a family! I bet you didn't know about her dream! How much she must have suffered... I bet you don't know! August in Tokyo It's all blurry! Let's eat something. I'm hungry. Want some? Come on... do you have to hold it like that? Takoyaki, takoyaki! It's so hot. I couldn't eat in one bite. These are images of Mom and Dad when we were young. Say you lost someone important. You may not be able to fill the void or replace them, but you can find someone new, understand each other, and be happy together. Regardless of how significant the loss, I believe it can happen. I believe you will stand strong. From Mom, Natsuki. Mom... I thought maybe I'll find you here. Hey! What's your name? Ryuichi Mizusawa. What's your name? Natsumi. "Summer" and "fullfill" when written. Natsumi Serizawa. "Summer" and "fullfill" for "Natsumi". So that the summer will be fulfilling... Natsumi! You must be heartbroken about something.
