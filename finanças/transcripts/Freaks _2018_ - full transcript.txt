Chloe! Hey! What are you doing? Someone could have seen you! You've got to be a good hider otherwise the bad guys will find you. Sorry, Dad. I'm Eleanor Reed. Age 7. I live at 726 Monroe Street. My birthday... Mhm... Is March 9th 10th. March 10th. Can I stir? Yeah, but keep practicing. That's my Mom, Nancy Reed. Her birthday is August 10th. Is she really going to love me? That's why we're paying her. That's my sister Harper. Harper. Her birthday's June 13th. She snores. Where'd you get that? I thought we were going with puppies. It's true Dad. She snores. Good job, Chloe. That is something a sister would say. Partners? Partners. What's the plan if I don't come back? I go to my closet. Yeah? And then what? If I run out of food I go across the street, tell Steve and Nancy that I'm Eleanor Reed and I give them the whole shebang if they take care of me. Let's go over the old classics, shall we? A. A is for Apple. Apple is a red fruit that you eat and it is delicious. You ever seen a green one? - Yes. - Okay, good. What's B? B is for baseball. A game played between two teams with 9 players who run in circles around a diamond-shaped field. Chloe what's your favourite sport? I've never played a sport. Bang! You're dead. That's not fair! You never asked me that before. If you don't know the answer to something you just make it up. You go... huh? I don't know! I love all sports. That's lying. Yes. You need to lie to be normal. How much money do you think is right there? Well these are hundred dollar bills so like a couple thousand? More than that. No, I'm not sure myself. Okay I raise ten. Can we have ice cream after dinner? You know we don't have any ice cream. When are you going? Not for a while. I was hitting the store too much. I can't wait until I'm normal. Are you going to call my ten or not? You're bluffing. Try me. All in. I missed the river. You win. You're getting good under pressure. Staying calm. That's good. Did Mom's eyes bleed too? Are my eyes going to bleed someday? I hope not. But if they do you're going to let me know, right? Right. You're going to say, 'hey Dad my eyes are bleeding, what the heck?' Yeah Alright now collect your million dollar jackpot Alright Make sure you get the ones in the back. I did! Oh well, last time I checked... Oof, there are knots in your hair. Ow! Alright. Time for breathing. Alright. Close your eyes, nice deep breaths. In. Exhale. In. You're not normal! It's not funny. It's not funny, Chloe. You need to practice this. You looked funny. You gotta practice this. It's important. And if I don't I'll go to the mountain? What are you talking about? Nothing. I never taught you about the mountain so you must have talked to someone. Did you go outside? No Did you go through Daddy's junk mail? Is that where you learned about the mountain? No. Chloe, Chloe, Chloe. This is not a game right now okay? You can never lie to me. I'm not lying. You're never mean to me, Mommy. Go away ghost. Go away ghost. Go away. Go away ghost. You imagined it. Ghosts aren't real. Stay with me. I'm scared. Okay but I can't fall asleep again. Too much time goes by outside when I'm asleep. I can only protect you when I'm awake. Mr. Snowcone. Whoa. Harper. Bring me ice cream. Please. Bring me ice cream. Please, please, please, please, please. Bring me ice cream. Bring me ice cream. Harper. Hello? Hi. I brought you ice cream. Is it chocolate? Yes. Hey! What are you doing here? Huh? I brought Chloe some ice cream. How do you know her name? How do you know her name? Huh? Huh? Harper? What are you doing here? You know better than to knock on strangers' doors. I am sorry about that. I don't know why she came over here. No, not at all. Not at all. Alright. Bye-bye now. Is this your daughter? Oh we should go. Gotta go. Hi. Hi I'm Nancy. You're beautiful. Oh my goodness she's a sweetheart. And she looks so normal. Eleanor, go back inside. Come on Eleanor, go back inside. Harper called you Chloe. Was that Nancy, for real? How did she know your real name? Have you been going outside? No. No, Dad! The closet is too scary! You know the punishment for breaking the rules. Time out. I almost got ice cream. You opened the door. You almost got us killed. Vroom, vroom. Vroom, vroom! I'm an ice cream truck and I give kids ice cream all around the world. Vroom, vroom. Oh no! There's a giant! There's Harper. She likes chocolate ice cream. What are you doing in my room, Chloe? Shh you can't call me that. I'm supposed to be Eleanor. Will you play a game with me before Dad wakes up? You are so annoying. Why do you always wake me up in the middle of the night? We can play at the park like normal people. You're allowed to play outside with other kids? Aren't you scared the bad guys will want to kill you? No. Everybody does it. It's fine. It's not fair that you have a Mom and I don't. Will you pretend to be my Mom? Ew. Why are you so weird? That's gross. Come on. No. Be my Mom. Be my Mom. Be my Mom. Be my Mom. Be my Mom. Okay fine. I'll be your Mom. Say you love me. I love you. Mom. I want to go outside. Am I allowed? Yes you can go outside. Thanks Mom. Now let's cuddle and sleep. I'm sorry I yelled at you. Mom said I could go outside. Chloe. She said I could go to the ice cream truck. Want to know what's in an ice cream truck? What? Frozen kid bodies. Not true. They kill kids and then they freeze them to eat later. I want to go anyway. You're not normal enough yet. You'll die if you go outside. It's not fair. Harper gets to go to the park and I don't. If I get you ice cream will you shut up about this? Yes. I'll get you a whole bucket if you never open that door ever again. I promise. Will you get it for me today? Fine. I need new supplies anyway. Yay! Thank you Daddy! Hide! They might have followed me. Daddy are you okay? It's okay. Most of this is their blood. Whose blood? What happened? Don't worry. I'll be alright. Just gotta be more careful. I can't be leaving the house for stupid, non-essential- You forgot the ice cream. What? Don't you realize I almost just died? I'm going to the grocery myself. Chloe. You see what happens when we go outside? When am I going to live with Nancy? Change of plan. What? Yeah. We have to stay hidden. Till when? Till when?! Well lookie here! What can I do for you, young woman? Are we safe? Safe? Safe from what? The people who want to kill us. Nobody's going to kill you if I'm around. Can I have ice cream? Sure! But what flavour, Chloe? Chocolate. Wow, a hundred bucks. You can buy a shitload of ice cream for a hundred bucks. Is that a lot? What do you mean is it a lot? You could buy any flavour you wanted with that. Really? Yeah. Come around back. Come inside. Taste any flavour you want. I'm not allowed. Oh, come on. Hey. You never have to do what your Dad tells you again. Come on up. Take a look around. Are there frozen kid bodies in there? It's an ice cream truck. Come on. I gotta go. There's other kids that have to have ice cream too, you know! But I'd love to have a big girl like you helping me out. You could actually make some of the ice cream. Here. Lookie here. Are you going to the park? That's exactly where I'm going! So come on. Is that a bad guy or a good guy? What do you think? He bleeds like my Dad. Well no, they just put that on him. That's like makeup. That's just because they want to scare the hell out of everybody. You ever bleed from your eye like that? No. You're not lying to me, are you? That's too bad. Woo! Push me! So Chloe, can you do anything special? Higher! How about when you're scared? Anything weird ever happen? Even! Higher! I want to touch the sky. I want to touch outside of the universe! Okay real high! Okay out of the universe here you go! Maybe you can fly! Go higher! Wait no! Stop pushing! Higher! Stop! That's too high! Now jump! I'm scared! Jump! Stop! Jump! Let me go! Have some courage. Come on Chloe. Jump out of the swing! I'm scared! Come on, jump out! Come on! Show some courage! I'm scared. What do you mean you're scared? It's okay. Don't you under- Come here. It's okay. Ow! What's the matter? Does that hurt? Yes! Does it make you mad? Yes! Now what happens when you really get mad? I take deep breaths to calm down. Is there anything that you can do that other people can't do? Well I've never met any other people. Well, you know what's happening? Your Dad is turning you into a pussy. You can't do that. You gotta be strong like your Mom was. You knew my Mom? Everybody knew your Mom. Your Mom was famous. What's famous? Famous means she had special gifts just like you. And everybody who knew her was scared to death of her, except the people who loved her. And then she died? You may not know this but in a land far away from here there is big evil dark mountain. I've heard of the mountain. Yeah, well your Mom and I went to that mountain together, and we tried to destroy it, and just as we... Hey. What's going on here? Everything okay little girl? It's okay bud. Actually we're getting ready to leave. Come on. I want to go home. Do you know this man? No. She's my granddaughter. Is this your grandpa? No. She jokes like that all the time. Shut up for a sec. Let me see your eyes. Why? You know why. Oh my God. Who is that? He's a bad man. He's going to kill us. Hey I'm not done talking to you. Yeah. No, it's cool bud. You know the people that want to kill us? That's him. That's him! - Shut up! - No! Don't kill us! I'm not going to hurt you, sweetheart. Just come here. You don't need to point the gun at us! We're leaving. Hey! He killed your mother! Step away from the girl! Make him go away. I said shut up. Get rid of him! Now! Go away! Let me see your eyes, old man. Go away! Look I said come here now, kid! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! You are a very special girl and you and I are going to do big things together. Now let's go home. Come on. All officers on alert. Abnormal child reported at Peachtree Park. ADF has been notified. Repeat. All officers on alert. You did good. Very good. Who is that? That's your Mommy. My daughter. She looks like an angel. Yeah she sure does. Just like you. I have a dream to get her back. I'm going to get her back. But she's dead. Well, sometimes angels can come back to Earth. Can I have it? No. It's the only picture I have of her and I'd like to keep it so I can look at her every day. Oh come on don't give me those eyes. Here, take it back. It's a rental. Just don't get boogers and all that crap out of your nose and stuff on it, okay? Okay. When am I going to see you again? When the time is right. You see, your Dad has to be asleep. So I have a present for you. When you hear the music from my truck, you put this in Dad's food and he'll go out. Like magic? That's exactly right. That's what it is. It is magic. Take it. And you know what else? You, madam, are not going to have to hide much longer. Chloe? Chloe? Chloe! Chloe! There you are. Did you hear me calling you? Huh? You scared me. I'm sorry I didn't get you any ice cream. I'll go out and I'll get you some tomorrow. I don't care about ice cream. Can I colour too? No. You're a liar. What? You lied about the bad people. They won't hurt me. What are you talking about? I'm going to go live with Nancy. Wait Chloe. I want a Mom! You had a Mom. You are not going to be like her. She died because she broke the rules. She didn't break the rules. She was special. And I'm special. Don't say that again, okay? I'm special. I'm special! I'm special! I'm special I can feel it! You're not special! Don't say that again okay? I hate you. You're not my Dad anymore. Baby I'm sorry. I'm just trying to protect you. You're a liar. I'm not lying to you. I'm so sorry. Get out of my room! Get out! Get out! Get out of my room! I hate you! I wish I had a Mom. You're so beautiful. Hello? Ghost? Who are you? Chloe. Chloe? No. What are they giving me? You're really my Mom? Chloe. Chloe. Chloe. No. You're not real. You sick assholes! Get this kid out of here before I rip her throat out! I'll kill you all! Dad? And that's why you came to town today, because of reports of a full-blooded minor. Is that correct? Yes, there was an interesting report. As you know, Abnormal minors are my particular area of interest. I can't help but notice you use the term 'Abnormal' as opposed to the more widely-used 'Freaks' - is that a political statement? I believe it's important for the ADF to try to normalize relations with the Abnormal community. Abnormal community? By definition, any Freaks who are running loose are illegal. Declaring a group of people illegal doesn't make them go away. It makes them go underground. They're forced to defend themselves to survive. Well to your point, the Amnesty Act gave Freaks an opportunity to peacefully relocate to Madoc Mountain. So, the ones who continue to hide in our cities, they're breaking the law, are they not? I believe in relocation and termination. Abnormals are dangerous and we can't let them live free. But I don't believe they are born evil. Everyone knows their abilities increase generation by generation. Their children are defined as living weapons of mass destruction. Isn't culling them as children the most humane approach? But I just I mean the last time Freak children were loose, we lost Dallas. Just imagine if we could raise an abnormal child ourselves. Teach him or her how to be good. With guidance, a child like that would be a powerful tool in our arsenal. I can't wait to live with you Harper. And have a normal family. We're really going to be sisters. Your Mom is going to love me. Harper? What are you doing here? This is my room. No it's my room. Who the hell let you in here? I'm going to live with you now. Who in the world is this? She's a weirdo who lives across the street. I'm not a weirdo. I know how to be normal. Are you friends with a Freak? She's not my friend. I'm not a freak. She's just messed up in the head because she doesn't have a Mom. She's such a freak. Freak! Freak! Freak! I'm not a freak! Freak! Freak! And I do have a Mom! And she's a ghost and she's famous and she lives in my closet! Freak! Freak! Freak! See! Mommy don't be scared. It's alright. The girls aren't here anymore. Go away. You're not real. You're not real. It's okay Mommy. Don't be scared. Oh my God. I missed you. You're alive. I thought you were dead. I'm not dead Mommy. You are. How long have I been gone? It's only been a few months and you were a baby and now you're... how did you get so big? Chloe how did you get in here? I opened the door. Chloe where are you? In my closet. Is your Dad there? Where is he? He's sleeping. He's always tired. Why do you live in my closet? I don't, Chloe. I want to be with you all the time. Oh I wouldn't want you to be here with me. Because you're dead. I'm ready for my new mom. But Dad says I can't have her. Your new mom? Nancy. She lives across the street and she makes cookies. You tell your Dad, you tell your Dad that he should move on, okay? And baby I'm so sorry that I can't be there with you. But I'm not going to be coming back, okay? And you should have a new mom. You should have a new mom, okay? We're coming for you soon bitch! What are you doing down here? I saw Mom. She lives in my closet. This is my alone time. She said I should get a new mom. She said you should move on. Stop making stuff up. I'm going to live with Nancy. I can be normal. Stop! Chloe! What's gotten into you? I wish you would die. Someday they will kill me. You'll be on your own and you'll regret saying that. I'm sorry Daddy. I made you special juice. Thanks. I'm sorry too. Partners? What's this? Are you trying to poison me? Chloe! Chloe! Chloe! What the hell is this? Where the hell did you get this? After everything I've done for you? Stop yelling! - Go to sleep! Go to sleep! - How could you do this to me Chloe? What are you thinking? I'm the only person keeping you alive, Chloe! - Go to sleep! Go to sleep! - Why'd you do this?! - Go to sleep! Go to sleep! - Chloe! Why did you do this? Whoa. Where are you going? Oh my God. Here. Whenever you feel you cry you must wipe away that tear. It's a dead giveaway. Okay? What's that? To get my new mom. Your new mom? What are you talking about, your new mom? Nancy Reed. Oh come on. I got a better idea than that. What? Real mom. Get in the truck. Now! It's getting close. Should be here in a few minutes. Now... showtime. I don't want to be here. When we go inside you don't say anything. Why? Just don't open your mouth. You're scaring me. Did your Dad ever tell you the story of the unicorns? Well, in a forest very nearby there was a whole big family of unicorns. Then one night a pack of snarling wolves came into the forest and grabbed the Mommy unicorn and took her away. And the Daddy unicorn who had a weapon right here chose not to use it. He wanted to hide. He wanted to be a peaceful unicorn. Well, the next night the wolves came back and they ate the Daddy unicorn. Then what happened? The baby? She's left alone. Doesn't know what to do. She knows that she's supposed to hide because that's what the Dad did. And so she thought if I do that then I can live peacefully in the forest. But you know what happened? There are no more fucking unicorns. Hiding is out. That's her. In the booth. Excuse me, Agent Ray? Uh, could I have a word with you for a minute? Sorry I don't have time right now, Father. I have something to tell you and I need to tell it to you, um, privately. Watch the door. May we? Please. My name is Father Tom Finnegan and you and I share a common dream. What dream is that? Well, this little soul here needs your protection. And we need you to take us to Madoc Mountain. Seven years ago a newborn was laid on the steps of my church with a note - a prayer - to keep her safe. I knew right then I might have an Abnormal. Why do you think that? Well it was right at the beginning of the relocation riots. You remember that. They were rounding up every Freak they could find. I had suspicions but I raised her all by myself. Look at me. Do you mind, Father? Please. You just admitted to a federal crime. I know what I did ma'am. But I also know if I raised her in the light of the Lord and taught her to love that she might never be a Freak at all. I'm not a freak. I'm normal. Um, it's okay. She's not going to hurt you. You don't need to pretend. I'm not pretending. What's your name, sweetie? I'm Eleanor Reed. I'm seven and a half and I like baseball. My dad is Steven Reed. He likes fishing but he's not very good at it. You can give it up. You don't have to do it. I just told ya. I'm not gonna tell you two or three times every time. Her Dad? She doesn't have any parents. I raised her by myself. I do so! My mom is Nancy Reed. Her birthday is August 10th. Cut it out! I'm going to have to make a call. But before you do, there is one condition. You have a condition. Forgive me, but I have to stay in her life. So I can continue to nurture her. Therefore you gotta take both of us to Madoc Mountain. I'm not going anywhere with her. I'm not a freak! Hey! Come back here! You scared her. Not your fault. Copy that. On our way. Don't ever do that to me again. Never wimp out on me. Why are you doing this? You have no idea how hard it was for me to get that bitch's schedule! I'm not a freak! I'm normal! Oh no, no, it's cool. I didn't hear anything. Hey maybe you're a Freak, maybe you're not a Freak. I don't care. That's not my business. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. What are you afraid of? Nothing. Um, could I borrow your pen? Yes, of course. Absolutely. No! No! His eye is bleeding! - Fire! - Stop! That's not the guy! Hold your fire! We gotta disappear. Goddamnit! Shit! Is that man going to be okay? No he's dead! That's what happens when they find a special person like us. You're dead! Period. You know they always fed us this crap about Madoc Mountain was gonna be a new home for us and a place where we could be independent. It's a goddamn death trap. Why did you want to live there? We didn't want to live there. We had to get inside it and the only way to get inside was to pretend we wanted to go there. I'll be goddamned if I'm gonna let anybody including you get in the way of me saving my daughter. But she's dead. I don't understand. Well you don't really have to understand. You're seven years old for Christ's sake and you, you have to allow me to teach you to use your powers now! I don't wanna! I'm giving Nancy the whole shebang to take care of me. No you're not. You're not giving her that money. We're going home to my apartment. Take me home. What? Take me home! TAKE ME HOME! Get out of my goddamn head! Take me back. Now. Alright I'll take you back. Jesus Christ. Goddamnit! Get out of the truck Chloe! Stay there. Don't you worry. I'll take care of this. Daddy! Grandpa stabbed a guy! And we also met a real bad guy! - But she was a girl- - Get in the house. Looking good, Henry. You're coming with me. Chloe! No Daddy! I don't want to go back to the house! I looked everywhere for a week. I want to go to Nancy's house! I can't handle you anymore. No Daddy let me go! What do I have to do to make you listen? Let me go! Let me down! Let me go! Chloe! You're special too Daddy? I tried so hard to protect you. I created a time bubble around our house to keep you safe. It worked as long as I could stay awake. For the rest of the world it's only been a couple of months since they killed Mom and we started hiding. But for us inside the house you grew up years. Everything is changing so fast. I wish I could stop time permanently but I can't keep you in the bubble forever. I'm ready. What are you doing here? Is everything okay? This has to happen now Steve. Um you know we're actually right in the middle of dinner. I brought dessert. Okay. Okay, yes. Come on in. Come on in. Honey we have guests. Eleanor. Mom why is she here? I'm Eleanor Reed. I'm seven and a half and I like baseball. Sweetie are you hungry? Come on sit down. I'll get you some food. Uh, okay. Are you joining us too? - No. - No. You were supposed to give us more notice. It's only been a month. We haven't even told Harper yet. After today you've never going to see me again. You'll get one of these every month as long as you don't call the ADF. Please take good care of her. Okay. I'm Eleanor. My birthday is March 9th and I live at 726 Monroe Street. That's where we live. Harper. How would you feel if Eleanor stayed with us for a little while? Her? Yes! No! No, she's weird. Harper, sweetie. Why are you being like this? I see her in my room at night. She makes me do things. - What kind of things? - That's impossible. - What do you mean, Harper? - She's never left the house until today. She crashed my slumber party. Okay? She forces me to... She's just a regular kid! She's a freak! Okay. Alright, you know what- She makes me hug her and kiss her at night. What? Maybe we need some more time to decide. Okay Nancy, just- Please. I just think we need to- We can't afford to say no, Nancy. Yes we can afford. Yes we can. That is our daughter- I knew he was a freak but not her. Honey, honey, honey... No! Don't tell me to. - Don't say it. - Can we calm down for one sec? Just calm down for one second, please! Eleanor, you're fine, right? Everything's alright. You're my Dad, Steven. You like to fish but you're not very good at it. Uh... Tell me you love me. Uh... Um... Sure. Love you. Do you love me Mom? You know what, I'm - I'm sorry. This is all a bit sudden. I just need a little bit more time. I think it's time for you to go and we'll discuss this later. I just need a little bit more time. No our deal- Tell me you love me. Our deal was that she was basically normal. No! We had a deal. When you think about it- Our deal was that she was not a freak! Tell me you love me. I think you should both go so it doesn't get out of hand, just, please. Tell me you love me! Nancy can we think about this for one second? Tell me you love me! I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you sweetie. I love you. You're my sweet little girl. Let me go. She got into my head. Get out! - Get out of here! - Just keep the money! Get out or I'm calling 911! Get out of here! - Just keep the money. - I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm so sorry. Sorry Daddy What the hell is going on? I don't want you to get mad. When did this start? You were supposed to tell me when your eyes started bleeding. What did she do now? Shut up Alan! What do you mean, shut up Alan? No! Please! I can't trust you anymore to follow the rules and stay safe. You can't do that to people. I promise I'll listen to you. I won't go outside. How long have you known? What the hell do you think you're gonna do? Lock her up forever? I'm keeping her safe from you. Oh for Christ's sake. In a shitbag like this? You're not awake all the time like you say you are. Don't start with your bullshit. She happens to be exactly what we've been waiting for asshole! It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Shhh. It's okay. Up in the sky birds sing a song between the clouds they sing their love. You'll always be here with me, right? Of course, sweetheart. Even after they kill me. I'll be right here. Right here. Okay? But you're already dead. I'm not yet, honey. Not yet. Don't fucking touch me! Don't! Looks like you pissed off somebody upstairs so finally you are going to pay. No! Chloe! Help! Help me Chloe! I said stay in the closet! They're taking Mom away! Your mom's dead! She's not dead, yet! Let me out! Let me out! You have to follow the rules! We have to save Mom! Please let me out! This is for your own good! I'm trying to keep you safe! Let me out! Daddy please! I'm sorry! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! If you don't let me out I'm going to kill you! Chloe? Chloe? Chloe! Chloe! Stop! Chloe stop, stop, stop! No, no! I'm sorry love. I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have done that. Are you okay? Say something. Hey. Hey. She's coming back. Hey. I'm sorry. It's my fault. I was just scared. I shouldn't have done that to you. Where's Mom? What did you see there? Don't start. What do you mean? If she had a vision of Mary I gotta know it. How could she have a vision of Mary if Mary's dead? Alan? She's not dead yet. She's in the mountain. What? Look. When I found out that she wasn't dead it was too late because you'd already taken off with the kid. Jesus Christ! I thought she was dead. You left her there! No! I barely got out myself! And you know what- They're going to kill her. She needs help. Dad! Yeah of course I blame you! You forced my wife to go on a suicide mission! She's my daughter! You left her there. It may have only been a few months for you Alan but I've been in this house for 7 fucking years! Well that's your problem! You're fucking nuts! You can't go crazy on me. We need to be partners. Maybe we can get her out. I have tried again and again and again while you're in here digging around and taping up mail slots or whatever the hell you're doing. I'm not talking about one of your ridiculous ideas. The only way you're going to get in there is if they let you in. And the only way they will let you in is with her. Oh, Chloe is going to have nothing to do with this. No! Chloe is gonna do it! Dad! Are you insane?! - I'm not insane! - Grandpa! I'm telling the truth! You've never accepted the truth. There's only one way in there and that's with her. Face it. She gets us in! Which gets Mary out! Dad! What? A wolf is here. And when we do we get the reward? When we verify their status. You'll be well taken care of. Okay, and you'll take them to Madoc Mountain? I can't have them coming back here. They'll know it was me. Madoc isn't set up to handle Abnormal children. Too risky. Besides since Mary Louis tried to blow the place up a few months ago they've kept it mostly empty. And suspects only make it there if they don't resist. And they usually resist. Good. That little Freak does things to my daughter at night. You can't hide this little girl on your own anymore. I gotta help. Come on to my place. I got it all figured out. No. Well then go out there and take care of all of your shit! I don't kill anymore. Well I suggest that this might be the perfect time to get over that phobia because if this man orders a strike we're done. We're dust. You got that? Hello? Sir is everything okay? Hello? No! Chloe! No! No! No! No! No! She's a bleeder! Stop resisting! Open fire! Look what you've done. What I've done? Chloe saved us. She saved us! Come here honey. Get out! No! Alan! Let me go! Let her go! Let me down! Where are you, you invisible asshole? Let her go! Let me go! Let me down! Let me go! Chloe! If I ever see you again I'll kill you, you piece of shit! Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy? Chloe? Is that you? Mommy? Where are you? Are they killing you now Mommy? Mary. Henry? I'm so scared. Device is armed. Ready to begin procedure immediately. Go ahead. Do it. I didn't - I didn't know you were alive. I never would have left. I'm so sorry. No. It's all my fault. Don't do that. Just promise me you won't let them touch Chloe. Promise me you won't let them get away with this! Oh my God. Chloe. I love you, okay? Mommy loves you so much. Don't forget that. Mommy loves you so much, okay? Chloe? I love you, okay? - Mommy loves you so much. - What are you doing with that? Hey! Goddamnit you can't do this to her! Chloe! We need your help! Get away from her! Get away from her! Damnit! Don't do it!!! No, no, no... Is something wrong? What are you doing? No, no, no! Stop it! No! No! I love you too, Mommy. Chloe? Oh my god. Shit! Shit. Now, no, no, you gotta hold still for a minute. Just like that. Doesn't hurt, does it? We need to leave. Now. You froze everyone. I'm already too drained. I can't hold this for long, okay? Then bring it back to normal. Then they'll get in! She wants to start a prison break from the inside. But she can't do it if everyone is frozen! We need to get out of here. I don't want to hide anymore. Chloe. Listen to me. The bad people are outside. If anything happens to the agent out there, we are never getting out of here alive. I can save Mom. It's our last chance. Talk to the lady outside. Just pretend you're normal. What? Like you taught me. I hate to be the one to break it to you but you really look like shit Thanks. Here. Hydrogen peroxide. It'll clear your eyes. You know something else? I got your back. And I've got a blue shirt that matches your eyes. Wow. My eyes are green Alan. They are? But thanks. Hi. Is everything okay? Sorry to bother you. I'm Special Agent Cecilia Ray. ADF. ADF? There are freaks around? They're under our control. Can I ask you some questions? I was just leaving actually. I have an appointment downtown. It's important. Can I come inside? Any weapons in the house? No. None that I know of. Squatters have been in and out so I don't know what they get up to. Take your glasses off. So you don't live here? Huh? Oh, no. I'm just the owner. You know I bought it with six other condemned shitholes. I get in there and I tear them down and I build them up. If you're in the market let me know. I found all this stuff here this morning and I came to check it out. Looks like there could have been a child here. You don't think they were Freaks do you? Could be. Abnormals are known to hide in abandoned properties like this. Disgusting animals. Are you a father? Yeah. Yes I am. Boy or girl? Boy. If you knew he'd be killed on site wouldn't you do anything you could to keep him safe? Yeah. I guess I would. I'd love to meet him. Little devil's in summer camp. Chloe. What do we do now Mom? I need to get outside. I can't defend myself until I get outside. Can you help? Yes Mommy but we have to be quiet because the bad people are here too. Okay but Chloe, listen to me, there's not enough room for me to use my powers underground here so we have to get out before they sound the alarm because if it goes off I will never be able to escape. You understand? Yes. Okay, come on. So uh... what happened across the street? The Reed family. Turns out they were Abnormals. Oh Jesus. There goes my sale price. I never, you know, thought this neighbourhood would have Freaks in it. Makes sense though I guess. How so? Eh well you know, when I was checking out this street I saw them. They were strange, you know. Accusing their neighbours of stuff, lying all the time, random piles of money around the house. And you didn't report them? I didn't think they were Freaks. Just thought they were assholes but I guess you really can't tell. They look just like us, right? Anyways I really need to get to this appointment so... Sit. Down. What? I know who you are. Excuse me? This house according to city records was foreclosed six months ago. Western Trust Bank owns it. Yeah, no, I'm actually a developer; I work with the bank. Henry. That's not the name of the bank that owns it. And I can still smell the peroxide on your face. Henry. You are Henry Louis right? Your wife is Mary and I'm pretty sure your daughter is upstairs. Look. It seems to me at this point you have two options. One. You can try to kill me at which point my colleagues will hellfire the house and we will all die. There's a Reaper 10,000 feet above us right now. Option two, and the reason I came in here alone, was to convince you that you can help Eleanor. Or Chloe. Whatever her name is. I'm listening. Hey Rob. Did you see the game? Dodgers are in, man. Playoffs this year. Baseball is my favourite sport. Yeah. Yeah, me too, Rob. I'm a parent too. I know you want the best for Chloe. If half of what your neighbours say is true about her, she's remarkable. And very valuable to us. Valuable? Valuable as a weapon. No, no, no, no. As a symbol. With us she'd be safe and with the right training she could even do some good in the world. Wouldn't you want that? Will I ever get to see her again? I want to be honest with you so that you know you can trust me. You will be killed. You will sacrifice your life for hers. But I mean, you've already been doing that, haven't you? I never wanted the world to turn her into a Freak. She's just a girl. I know exactly what you mean. And you? Won't you put the gun down and do what's best for your granddaughter? A hellfire missile takes 60 seconds from launch to strike. And he and I both know that in that 60 seconds we can do a goddamn bunch of damage. Alan. Calm down. We need more time to think. Dr. Daulby didn't radio in after procedure. Can you go to the execution chamber and see if he's in there? Copy that. On my way. Mommy? They're gonna find out. Chloe? No! Chloe! Oh shit! Nobody move. You're not gonna shoot me. Hold the hellfire. I'm coming out with the girl. No, Chloe! No! No! Chloe! No! Come on! Oh my God. You're freeing her. Such a waste. Oh, no. Chloe. No, no. Don't do this. Don't you dare! Don't you want a normal life? Grandpa! I'm fine. Just go to your Mom. Let's go get it done. Agent Ray. Agent Ray, come in! Agent Ray. We heard gunfire. Agent Ray, do you copy? Let's try to slow them down. I have your agent hostage. Move away from the house. Keep going. Okay sir. Let's just try to calm down. I just want to talk to Agent Ray alright. You better get away from my house or I'm going to melt all your brains with my Freak powers! Okay no problem sir. We're moving back. I just want to make sure my friend's okay. Dad! I can't help Mom when she's frozen! Just a second honey! Launch hellfire! Stay back! Stay back! Let's go! Let's go! Move it! Move it! Move it! Chloe, can you hear me? I need you! Chloe! I need you! Chloe, get up! I need to get outside! Chloe please get up, you can do this. You can do it Chloe. Chloe can you hear me? Open the door! They're going to kill me! I need you! You know where to find me mommy? Yeah, I can feel you. Daddy? Dad? Daddy? Wake up! Dad! Can you hear me? Hey. I'm so proud of you. I love you so much! And I am so sorry. You are special. Partners? Partners. No! Please come back. Come back. No. Come back. Please come back. Wake up. Wake up, wake up, wake up! Come back, come back, come back. Oh shit! Mom? Chloe! Are you okay? Listen to me. I will protect you from now on, okay? And we'll find a new place to hide. No. I don't want to hide anymore. I'm sorry baby, but we have to. We have to. We can live wherever we want. And if anyone bothers us, we know how to make them stop. Okay. You ready? Yeah? Hold on.
