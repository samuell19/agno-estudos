Mr. Tung. Tu. Let me introduce you, Hui, This is Mr. Tung. Did you bring your passport? What for? Let's see your passport Why do I need a passport here? I went drinking last night. They said that you were in Xiamen, in a... ...Wen, where was it? A hotel. Which one? The Lujiang. Right. You were caught whit a whore at the Lujiang Hotel... ...and they stamped your passport with the words "Whore Client."Right? It's nothing. Nothing? So you get stamped. Tear it out and get a new passport, right? Smart. Not bad. What wasn't bad? That Shandung girl. Great. She comes out of the bathroom... ...and I couldn't understand what she wanted. I had to go in to find out. She didn't know how to turn off the water. How could I understand her dialect? It was great. You could see the sea from the window. I told her to bend over so we could see the sea. It was great. How novel, just like a kid. Be careful, you'll get a stroke one day. No problem. I'm fit. The money's here. Wen. Take him to the warehouse. Go with him. Bye, Mr. Tung. Is this kid reliable? Don't worry. When I was in Xiamen... ...he was with me all the way. Don't worry. Dung. I'm here. Wen, wait here a moment. Have a cigarette. Make sure everything's here. Where's Wen? I think he ran into someone and is talking with him. Here's your bike. Di. That's about it. I'll go say goodbye to your boss, Put everything away. How's the stuff? Not bad. Sit down. Have a drink. Thanks, but I've got some business to take care of. No drink? Tu, see him out. No need. Watch out for yourself. When my Dad got in trouble, I had to help. Two years ago, my uncle went to jail in a big crackdown. He told me, "There's no warmth in society..." "...This family's now on your shoulders." Dad got in trouble after drinking. Agao used his weak point. Agao's relative bought this land... ...and sold it to my Dad. He even lent Dad a 600,000 NT check for the deposit. What a scam! Then they proceeded. They said Dad couldn't pay, so they confiscated the deposit. Then they asked him to pay back There's no justice. My aunt wouldn't help, nor would my uncle's friends. Only Guo's brother-in-law helped. Guo is my real brother. Get a pack of cigarettes. Make some tea. This is Foochow, Ahai's brother-in-law. I know. What a surprise to see you. You know it's on account of that land in Wuxiung. I hear your pal Gabo is taking care of it. This is Gabo's uncle. Old Foochow did nothing... ...but brag his mouth off. Claimed he would buy the land. With what? his ass? He hasn't even come up with the 600,000 deposit. If Gabo forced him to give back the 600,000... ...his only choice would be to die. What I'm trying to say is... Ahai is one of us, right? He's in jail, so we have to leave his brother-in-law some face. Tell Gabo to settle things in person. The land is there. Someone's going to buy it. I can help introduce someone. Have some tea. That land by the Huwei Police Station up for bid. Over a hundred parties submitted bids, but no one got it. I have a connection. That's best, because Gabo's uncle was among the bidders. If this connection works, there's money for everybody. Boss. So Foochow is here? Shit, couldn't find you anywhere. Hongxia, what are you doing? Enough, damn it. Doa, what are you doing? Tell Hongxia to come out. What for? Get him. It's about my Dad's business. What about your Dad's fucking business? Stop shouting. I want to give him money back. Shit! What are you shouting about? Hongxia, Doa is here with money for you. U.S. Dollars! Hurry! What do you want? I want to pay you back. Then give me the money. You wanted it, so come and get it. Shit, you know there're gambling inside, so stop shouting. Are you crazy? I'm here to give you money. If you want it then hurry up and take it. Hongxia, what's going on? Shit! the kid's tired of living. Who gave you this knife? Who gave it to you? Say it. You're going to court even if you don't say it. It's not mine. Then why is it on you? Why is it on you? What do you have against that guy in the yellow? Why did you attack him? What's between you? Hongxia, watch yourself! Sit down! Sit down! Sit down! Let's get straight answers. I've seen all sorts of hoodlums. Do you think no one dares send you to jail? Sargeant, what's going on? Oh... Councilman Ling. Nothing...nothing... Someone called in, so we had to respond. This sort of recreational gambling... ...isn't like murder or arson, right? Please assist us in any way you can. Stop writing. Go home. Everybody go home! Sorry, Councilman. Continue writing. I can't make this decision. What's the problem? I'll push the budget through ahead of time for you. Really sorry, you'll have to talk to our boss. Times are changing. You have to use your head. Look at you, you're still a sergeant after all these years. Let's go. I'll take care of things! Talk to our boss. Then you call your boss and tell him to talk to me. Call him yourself. You call him! Someone called in... Yung... Stop writing! Don't worry, I'll handle things. Hello? It's me. I have no opinion. He treats our unit like shit. Doesn't even see us. Right? It was I who brought Foochow over there. They didn't give me face. They're too arrogant. If that's the way they play, we have no choice. Right, T know. I know. The boss is afraid of him. I'm not afraid of him. I get paid a salary. Guys like Councilman Ling have a part in everything illegal. They never deal with legal things. He won't get elected next time. Okay, I understand... Okay, I'll look for Tsai... Is Doa going to be okay? Okay? Otherwise... Otherwise... You think you're right about everything. But you screw everything up. Yes...that's what they wanted to do... You should talk to me first. When you're angry, you don't think too much. Look at you... ...You associate with these shady characters... It's not that I enjoy criticizing you. You should go to your third sister's... ...and stop fooling around here. There's no future for you here. I don't want to talk about third sister. I want to know if Doa's okay. Do you take me for the Commissioner of Police? Think of some way. I won't. I won't go to third sister's house. Then what are you going to do here? It's better here. So you want to become a gangster, huh? I didn't say that. All you do is associate with these shady characters... You should get to know some useful people. Keep staring and I'll hit you. Are you looking for a fight? What's wrong with you two? Fighting all the time... Not even my father has ever hit me on the head. You keep hitting. Guo, why are shouting for? It's your brother-in-law. It's all the same. It gets worse and worse. You can communicate through speaking. Why hit him? Sit down. Why be so angry? I hit you because I care for you. I wouldn't bother with someone else. Sit down, let's talk. Think about it... For my sake, why don't you let Doa out? You're a fool! Don't blow it this way. That doesn't do it. Have another. How come there's no smoke? Don't move. Let me do it. Got it this time. It's my turn. Don't hog it all. "Don't love me, or I will be scared to death..." Want a cigarette? I told you to stop talking, so stop. Apple, go wash the dishes. All right, Grandma, in a moment. Dad, there's someone downstairs looking for you. I think it's those guys again. Tell them I'm not here. Xiaogang, go take a look. Is it Agao and his boys again? Guo, get the machete. Let me wash them. You rest. Jie. What are you doing with the knife? Nothing. Is your dad home? He's upstairs. Jie. Jie, what's wrong? Meimei. Don't touch me. Give me the chair, fast. Excuse me, is there a man named Biao here? Which Biao? "Crazy" Biao. Crazy Biao! You have a guest! Crazy Biao. You have a guest. Biao, I'm Doa. Hurry. What's up, Doa? Jie asked me to come. Wait a minute. Meimei, here's the water. Thanks. I'm over there. Call if you need me. Okay. Welcome. Jie. Biao. Have a seat. What would you like to drink? Ying. My sister's looking for you. This is my girlfriend Meimei. This is Biao and his wife. The ones I'm always talking about. How've you been lately? So so. And you? Same. Doing some contracting work. By the way, do you have Molt's phone number? MOLI? Yes. Give me my book. I tried this number. They said he moved. Moved? Then I don't know. What are you looking for him for? Sargeant. Who's that guy? You're back. Who's that guy? Biao. I know Biao. I mean the other. The other guy. That's Jie. He used to work for my uncle. The one who used to go around with Ahai. Play this one first. Okay. Biao. Sargent. Long time no see. You should come by more often. Have a cigarette. Jie, do you still remember me? Drink up, Sargent. Things must be pretty good in Taipei. Biao, it's your song. Hurry. Let's go sing. Come on, let's sing. Don't just sit there. Help out. Get some beer, Guo. Drop by whenever you're around. Business seems good. It's okay. The boys help by coming around. Excuse me. They're intoxicated. Hello? Who? Nan? Just a second. Nan. Have you found Moli yet? Did he say any thing? I'm with Biao. Jie came back from Taipei yesterday. He said that his pal got shot... ...and died. He himself was injured. They say "The pet mouse bit open the bag.‚Äù It was an inside job. His brother's cousin. Jie's been very moody since. Uncle used to say that about him all the time. Warned him not to be so impulsive. He said if you want to be a gangster you first have to learn to be a man. Take it as a career. Practice tolerance. I feel that now that uncle's gone, they've all changed. Before there were all these people, making tea, having a good time. Jie, we're going for a walk. Where to? Over there. We'll be right back. So how's it going? I contacted him. Tomorrow. He's in Fangliao now. He'll meet us at the Hamaxing Restaurant tomorrow. Don't worry. We'll discuss how to settle things together. What's the matter? Tell me? Shit! Why don't you tell me? Don't treat me like an outsider. What's the matter? Don't worry. I'll handle it myself. Let me know. What's the matter? We're brothers. Don't act alone. Say it! I told you not to stay in Taipei. Come back here to us. What's wrong with you? Don't worry, Boss, I'll avenge you. I'll avenge you. Listen, Doa, When Biao and I get out of the car... ...you come to the driver's seat. Remember, don't stop the engine. Guo, you stay in the car too. Jie, how do you use this thing? Just turn off the safety and you can use it. Don't play with it now. Stop playing. You stay here later. Our two most important guests today... ...Let's bring them on stage. Let's have a round of applause for them. Here come the bride and groom... Take care of the kids. Wen. Sorry Biao. Biao, are you okay? Biao. Jie...what should we do? Biao. Stop talking, Biao. Lie down for a moment. Guo. Take care of Biao. Okay. I don't know what to do. Stop shouting. What are you doing? Put the gun away. Get a hold of yourselves. Shit, Guo, hurry. Don't worry. Hang on. Guo. Guo. Hurry, Guo... Doa, here's some money and a watch. Take them. You go back to Peikang. Biao's situation isn't that good. I got to get him to the hospital fast. Hang on. Biao left us. "The boat goes over water without a ripple.‚Äù Meimei brought 300,000... ...to give to Biao's wife. His wife kept crying, and wouldn't accept it. Their family wouldn't forgive Jie. Some of the talk was ugly. They said that he should account for it. 300,000 is too cheap for a life. Biao's mother said it must have been his debts from his previous life. It was his destiny. She said that it was always Jie... ...who helped out when Biao was down. He'll be right down. Guo, Jie just called. He said that Biao's gone. Here... Take this 100,000. Shit, I told you not to flash it. Put the bullets back in. I didn't do it on purpose. I told you not to show it. Now look what's happened. They wanted to look. How did I know what would happen? Show them the gun... ...and you'll lose it. You guys really fucked up. Are you prepared to die for lying? Come on, we're all pals. Jie couldn't make it. He asked me to give this to you. Please give it to Biao's wife. Meimei, Chi. How come only the two of you are here? Jie couldn't make it, so I came with her. So you're pretty tough. Carrying a machete, eh? Scared the shit out of Hongxia. Really? How much? This one's on me. No need to be so polite. So you haven't gone to the States? Fuck, so where do you think you are now? Well? When are you going to the States? Are you listening to me? Well? Well? What are you looking at? Shit... You dare touch my brother? So try it again! Try it again! What's the matter with you? Auntie. Guo... Guo... Guo... Get up. Get up. Guo... Guo... Don't hit him like that. Get up. Tell me the truth: who gave you the gun? Don't play dumb, damn it. Hurry up and tell me who gave you the gun. If you don't tell me... ...I'll lock you up here forever! Stop pretending. Guo... Tell me, and I'll help you settle things. Do you hear me? Guo, do you hear your brother-in-law talking? Get up and eat. Shit... What's with you? Speak nicely. Don't hit him like that. He's getting me into big trouble. I've got to make a phone call. Get him up. Okay. Guo... Get up, okay? Doa, did you know that your mother called? Would you say something? Are you going to go to the States or not? You should let her know. I think it's better if you go. Otherwise you'll get involved with all these juveniles... ...and learn all the bad things. Wait a minute. Doa, it's yours. This is Doa. Shing? Isn't Guo at his third sister's? I'll be right there. Doa... Doa... Doa... Your clothes are here. Doa... What about what I just asked you? You always ignore me. Never answer. Why have you written all these letters? How strange. What are you doing? You shouldn't read other people's letters. What's the big deal? You're already separated... ...Why keep writing? You shouldn't read other people's letters. How bizarre. Doa. What are you calling him for? I want to ask him if he's going to America or not. His mother keeps calling and asking if he wants to apply or not. If he wants to, then hurry, it's not that easy. What? Don't you know that his mother wants to take him to the States? Didn't you know? He never mentioned it to me. Go ask him. What kind of a father are you? All you do is write letters all day. When will you concern yourself with your own son? How come he never told me about such an important thing? Xiaogang... Xiaogang... Xiaogang... Xiaogang... Your aunt told me... ...that your mother wants to take you and your sister to America, right? So your visas are all in order, huh? Speak. How come I know nothing about this whole thing? You haven't even mentioned it to me. You're grown up. You should know better. Are you really going to America? Then you're abandoning me, right? So what's left for me? Do I have any hope left? You want to drive me to my grave. I don't want to see you again. There's no sense in living anymore. Uncle! Uncle! Dad... Hurry. Dad... Don't move. Lift this up first. Dad... Be careful. Uncle. Don't move him. Hurry up and call someone. Call. Hurry up and call. Dad... Can you get it off or not? Shit, it's my first time. You never call me for the easy jobs. Shing, where's Doa? Didn't you call him? He said he'd be right here. Then call Anwang and tell him I want ten vials. Okay. Wait a minute. Super Boss. Shit, how'd you get in here? I came to settle accounts. You weren't here, so I waited for you. Shit, didn't we settle just last week? Super Boss. Come here a moment. What for? Please come here a moment. Super Boss, give me 50,000. I'm on the run. I don't have it. I'm asking you, please. Okay? Super Boss, where are you going? Didn't you say you wanted 50,0007 Don't double cross me. Here, have a hit. Anwang. Anwang. Shit. What's the rush? Give it to me. Hurry. How come there's only two? That's all there is. What are you doing? Here's more. Hurry up and bring it out. You're too much. Hand it over. Isn't this half of one? I need some too. By the way... ...doesn't your boss have a Blackstar gun for sale? Jun said he wanted it a few days ago. I don't know if he took it or not. Then ask for me. Go ask for me now. He's in the gambling parlour. So? Go ask. Please. Just ask. It won't be good if I go now. If you don't go now I'll smash you. Do you really want to buy it? Do I look like I'm bluffing? Thanks. Weren't you at your sister's? My brother-in-law was holding me at my granduncle's place. So you escaped? Where's your thing? What thing? Oh, I left it at home. Why bring it around all the time? Then lend it to me. Go get it and lend it to me. I'll buy another one for you. Who do you want to get? Please, it's a gun. Shoot it and someone dies. I need it for something. If you really need it, I'll get it for you right away. Shit, hurry up and run. Guo... Guo... Don't run if you've got guts! Stop it! Guo... Let's go. Guo... Guo... Come here and take a look. What is this? Is this made from amphetamines? This is good stuff. Great stuff. Keep this. You've got to keep this. Shit. Do you have bullets? I don't know, take a look. Check it out! Over here. Are you sure? Just try it. I'll have fun first. I want to try it too. Don't aim it down there. Apple. Ask Xiu to help him. Is anyone looking for me? Doa, the bus is here. Listen, no matter who's looking for me... ...don't tell them where I am. Hurry. I'm going to Taipei on business. Don't tell anyone. Okay! let's go. Take it. Hurry. What's your rush? He's not turned on. He's not turned on? Meimei gave me a beeper number. I'll give it a try. If I don't let him win, he'll cry. If this goes on this way, he'll cry. He'll weep. He'll walk back to the countryside. Men shoot pool. Kids play with balls. If I wins, you walk home. Damn it, stop the talk, okay? Hey kid, control your temper. Relax. It's a game. We're not asking you to till the fields. Shit, stop the talk while we're shooting, okay? The little fart's angry. Your turn. Hurry. It's only 500. At most I'll give you 100. I'll pay for it if you lose. It's okay. I have money. If you have money then don't play. Or you'll become penniless. Shit, can you stop talking? What's that? He's pulled out a toy gun. Shit, you call it a toy. Is this a toy? What's going on, Guo? Nothing. Get away. Shit. What are you doing, Guo? Do you know here you are? Shit, they keep talking while we're playing. Let's go. Shit, let's go. If they hadn't kept talking, I wouldn't have fired. All this talk over a game. Shut up. Look what you've done. The cops might come. Listen, you guys come to Taipei, I want you to have a good time. I bring you to my club for some fun. So what is all this for? How can I explain this to the other investors? How am I going to continue doing business? The clientele will be too scared to come again. Listen, I didn't do it on purpose, okay? It's no use talking to you. You never listen. I told you not to be so impulsive. Look what you've done. So are you satisfied now? Chi, can you call Meimei for me? Okay, I'm sorry for shooting today. I was wrong. They were all right. You never think about me when you do things. What do you mean? If I hadn't considered you, those guys would all be lying on the ground. Right? It's not like I shot anyone. Sorry. I was wrong to fire. But they shouldn't have been that way, right? Where's Meimei? I'm trying to call her. Are you really calling her or not? You've called her three times already. But I... What's going on? We came to Taipei to see her. Do you think I would fool you? I want to find her as badly as you. Wow, she's angry. She's angry. That's because he's so rude. Is this the place? No, I need to go to the bathroom. What do you want to drink, Chi? I'll have ice tea. Okay. Guo, what do you want? How about a Coke? What? What do you want to drink? How about this? What do they have? Root beer, coke... Shit, come back! Hey...hello... What do we do now? Can we go to your place or not? My place is okay, but it really would be inconvenient. Inconvenient! Then you have to help us find Meimei and Jie. The problem is we've been trying to find them all day. We haven't gotten any rest. We should worry first about where we're sleeping tonight. Let's just find a hotel. A hotel. Do you have any other choices? We'll take care of things tomorrow. Hey, driver, that was real shitty of you... ...to throw our things out and drive away. Real shitty. Now you've brought reinforcements and you talk loud. You look like an adult, but to fight with kids you bring out reinforcements. This is real shitty. This is real shitty. You just throw our things out and drove away. So what have you brought all these guys out for? What? You want to fuck my mother? Let me fuck yours first! I'll bury you on the hill. Did you hear me? Shit, didn't your daddy ever tell you... ...to hide if someone shows a gun? One for each of you. Bye. Anything interesting on video? There's a private cable channel. What would be worth watching on a TV channel? Try the cable channel. Answer the phone, Apple. Doa, it's you. Dad's okay. He's still in the hospital. Lot's of people are looking for you. Agao...and Guo's brother-in-law... ...no, but they know that you're in Taipei. ...also, Jie called you several times. He even called a few minutes ago. He said it was urgent.

On the day of the Mid-Autumn Festival, his sister and I... ...sent him back to Peikang, to his father's graveside. There was a traffic jam on the freeway. It took us six hours. It rained hard the day of the funeral. It was like the sky was crying. Guo's sister left me his diary. He wrote it while he was on probation. In the diary he wrote... "May 15, overcast..." "Life is a vast ocean. Went with sister to Granduncle's Funeral." "It rained hard." "I thought of the day Dad and Mom died in that car crash."‚Äù "I thought of the day Dad and Mom died in that car crash."‚Äù "The rain kept falling, like my sorrow."
