(dramatic swooshing) (wind whipping) (wings flapping) (birds squeaking) (animal howls) (deep suspenseful music) - You're going down. - Funny, I was thinking the same about you. (punch thuds) (adventurous music) (plaster crackling) (bold adventurous music) (Metaluna thuds) - You have lost, Metaluna. Time to die. - No. No. (laser whirring) - Is there no one big enough, strong enough, to defeat the mighty Spa-Zor? (yells) - [Woman Over PA] Spa-Zor to the Queen's platform, please. Spa-Zor to the Queen's platform. (electronic beeping and whirring) (slow daunting music) (doorbell rings) - Prunella, the door. (object clinks) - Yes, oh mighty queen. (door whirring) - You wanted to see me, Empress? - Spa-Zor, your glory is always welcome here in my chambers. - Thank you, Empress. You wanted to have words with me? - I do. (gentle digital music) But first, the trimea. I hope you relish it as much as I. (liquid dribbling) To the next victory. (mysterious electronic music) - Thank you, Empress. (soft electronic music) - There will come a time when you will take my throne by force, as I did once with my superior. But I have some time yet, so don't get any funny ideas. I have a few more thousand millennia. But we do have something to fix. - And that is? - Well recently, I intercepted a thing called a wavelength, an old form of communication, very primitive. And I traced its origin to there. (static buzzes) (funky electronic music) Little minuscule planet called Earth, apparently inhabited by millions of the minature creatures, weaklings all. But, legend has it that there is one amongst them, one great giantess. And that, is our challenge. Most formidable. You need to go to planet Earth, find this great giantess, challenge her to a duel. And then we will broadcast live the bloodshed all over Buxomus, and it will be such great morale for the planet. - This bitch have a name? - She goes by the name Beverly. - Wrong. Her name is Toast. (tense mysterious music) (spacecraft roars) - Your ass is mine now, bitch. (grunts) (spaceship whirring) (mysterious music) (explosions booming) (upbeat electronic music) (spaceship whirring) (digital beeping) (upbeat electronic music) (rocks rumble) (upbeat electronic music) - Hey, toots. That one's too damn big to break down. How 'bout it? - I got it. (rock thuds) (rocks crumble) - Now, that's what I call a foot job. - That-a baby. - That-a big baby. Mama needs to take that one off the milk. - I'll show you a big baby. (water splashes) - Hey, how am I supposed to go to the bar lookin' like this? - Aw, does baby need his diaper changed? (whistle blows) - It's about time you took a shower. Is it Saturday already? - You gonna do something about her? - Probably gonna give her a raise. She's the best worker I have, twice the work in half the time. - I heard you already gave her a raise. - Hey, that's enough. I won't have it. - I don't know how it stands at all. She's a freak. - One more word outta you and I'll-- - And you'll what? - You sure you wanna find out? - But, of course. - I thought so. Now get. Whistle already blew. - You have fun with your fre, girlfriend. I'll be filing a grievance with the union. - Do whatever makes you feel big. Hey, Bev? - Yeah? - This guy's leaving. You wanna blow him a little kiss? - You sure? - I'm sure I'm sure. - Sure you won't get jealous? - Come on baby. Give me a big old smooch, right in front of your man. (wind whips) (man thuds) (boots scuffling) - You have anything else you wanna add? - Good night, Mike. Good night, Miss Beverly. I'll see you first thing tomorrow morning. (gentle lighthearted music) - You okay? - Totally. - Liar. - They're right. I'm a big freaky-deaky. - Well, then I'm a pinhead for liking you. - You say the sweetest junk. - By the way, it's payday. I already deposited your check into your account. You can check for yourself if you-- - I trust you. - Thanks. - (scoffs) I'll just need to work at this dirty place for the next zillion years to pay off all my lawsuits and bills. - Is it so bad? - I, I didn't mean it like that. I, I appreciate all you've done for me. You're the only person who stood by my side. - I get it. You're used to the life of Riley. This is my life of reality. - It's not that. I don't miss the clothes and the money and the parties. (sighs) I just would wanna sleep in a real bed for once. - Maybe someday. - (sighs) This is really hard for me. I was a self-made girl. I was so independent. Being 50 feet tall is like so five months ago. I was, I was love hated for so long, and now I'm just hate hated. - What's better? Being admired by millions of strangers or knowing the love of one single person who has your heart? - Hmm. Just kidding, you goob. You know you mean everything to me. It's just that, I try to do something really positive for the world, and I ended up wrecking the entire city. All of my money gone overnight, my ex made sure of that. And, even if I had all that money, it still wouldn't make a dent in all my lawsuits for smashed houses, smooshed power lines, and broken ribs or whatever. - Nah, it's just like construction. - I used to be the poster girl for obscene wealth and hotness. And now, I'm the poster girl for like, a monster movie. - I love monster movies. (deep somber music) - Having fun down there? - (laughs) You rock me, baby. - Are we interrupting anything? - Boy, what I wouldn't give to be him right now. - Professional. Remember? - I guess. - Hey dudes - Dr. Dude, please. Lana. I mean, (sighs) nevermind. It was pointless. - Thanks for coming down to the site, must mean you got some good news, right? - Mm, not at all. - You mean I'm getting worse? - No, I mean, this is just a courtesy visit, to assure you we're still thinking of your plight. - We have no real results one way or another. So um, yeah, hi. How ya doin'? - Still big AF. - You're seriously writing that down? - I'll research it later, could be fortuitous. - Most likely not. - So, no change in the results from last time? - Not at all. She's no smaller than she was before. But on the bright side, she's no larger. - We think that's something. - Like what? - Fuchsia and Gary returned to normal size. Why them and not me? - Inconclusive data, unfortunately. Our theory is, they ate less of the substance than you. - Beverly Wood's uhholy meatrimony. - Yes, that substance. - I thought of that name myself. - Also unfortunate. We want to run some more tests on them to see if we can string together a timeline of consumption and events. - Then do it. - Well, we have no blood or cell specimens at this moment right now. - Why is that? - Mm, both of them are boffin' their brains out in Hawaii for an indefinite amount of time. - Dennis. (chuckles nervously) - Well, sorry. - Don't worry, Bev, it'll happen. And if it doesn't, that's okay too. - Sorry to break that news, Miss Wood. - You know, maybe this is me being selfish, which means I've matured a little bit, but I don't really care about them. I just care about me, and I don't wanna be a freak forever. - Gary ate only a little of the substance. - Beverly Wood's unholy meatrimony. - Yeah, that one. We're still unclear as to how much Fuchsia ate. It could all just boil down to metabolism. It just hasn't worked its way out of your system as quickly as it did theirs. We have no explanation, just theories. - Sucks. - Well, that's it? - Sorry to say. - Thank you doctors, for keep on keeping on. We both appreciate you. - We are working on this, and we'll be in contact if we find out anything at all. In the meantime, we're only just a phone call away. Call us for anything, Miss Wood, even if it's just emotional support. Make sure you ask for me though. (chuckles) Let's leave these two. (mysterious music) (spacecraft whirring) - Computer. - [Computer] Yes. - Bring up intel on my challenger. - [Computer] Okay. (computer whirring and beeping) - That's her, that's the dead meat. - [Computer] Me-ow. - Enhance. Not that type of enhance. - [Computer] Oh my stars and garters. I'm not sure what's gotten into me. - Enhance. More enhance. Your face is so punchable. (fist thuds) - [Computer] Hey! (spacecraft whirring) (gentle music) (crickets chirping) - Oh, look. Shooting star. (gentle mysterious music) Make a wish. - I wish I was normal again. (Beverly sighs) - What's wrong? - I used to be a star, burning bright. And now, I'm like this big black hole of suckage. - Don't say that, Bev. - If space were an emoji, it'd be a sad face. - Well, you definitely don't suck. - It used to be my specialty. I'm so horny, and we can't do anything without you getting hurt. - I've got just the thing. (gentle mysterious music) - Really, work? Now? - Nope. - Really? Spulunking? - (chuckles) I like to think of it more as spaloving. (drill whirs) If I'm not back in half an hour, don't send help. (chuckles) (drill whirring) (Beverly moaning) Geronimo! (Beverly gasps) (light-hearted music) Wakey-wakey, legs and sexy. (Beverly moans) - Good morning. You uh, really hammered me last night. (chuckles) Literally. - Open those pretty peepers. I got a little surprise for ya. - What's that? Breakfast in bed, or croissant in the quarry? - Even better. Your fan club is here. (women giggling) - Hey, it's my only fans. - We love you, Miss Wood. - We have a gift for you. - What's that? - Spa day! (fans cheer) - Yay. (whimsical music) (nail file scrapes) (whimsical music) (polish sprays) Thank you, girls. Let's dance. (upbeat music) (static buzzes) - Hi, I'm director Jim Wynorski, and I'm stopping this film right now. There's just too much gratuitous sex. (plates splatting) (whimsical music) (fans cheering) - Thank you so much. You really made me feel like a real girl again. - No problem, Miss Wood. - I wanna be just like you when I grow up. - Don't grow up too fast. Trust me. - We love you, Beverly. (women giggle) - I love you too. Whoo-hoo. (wind whipping) (spacecraft whirring) (wind whipping) (mysterious music) (foot thuds) (rocks crumble) - You want me to fight that? - It'll be the biggest battle of all time. Literally. - Look at her. I think you'd agree, she has a few pounds on me, not to mention an extra 45 feet. - Details, details. Once you've grown to her size, this'll be easy-peasy, giant squeezy. - Grown to her size? - We'll talk about that later. - Damn right, we will. - You'll wipe the desert floor with her ass, and your booty will be rolling in the looty. - I don't know, your, your schemes are usually scams. - I got this. Every eyeball on Earth will pay to see this big bitch battle royal, with cheese. Big bitch battle royal with cheese. - Aren't you afraid she's gonna recognize you? She'll stomp on your head. - My son, Bradley, okay, had it coming. Okay? But it wasn't me who took advantage of her. He's strung her along for years. Tell you the truth, I wanna make her and us rich and famous again, and filthy, stinking, honking rich. - How's your son doing these days? I heard that motor boating accident really traumatized him. - Traumatized? It almost killed him. (eerie whirring) - From yesterday alone, Beverly Wood Branding received 3.2 million individual views across all brands. - They live in their mom's basement, 'cause they spend all their money on you. The hottest girl on the internet. It's what the fans want. Scientists, a good morning all depends on the mood of Beverly, and her mood depends on if this is ready or not. - Well, there's still some testing that needs to be done. Well, it's not a real carrot. I mean, it looks real, but it's a Beverly Wood carrot. - Right, so what kind of side effects are we talking about here? - Death. - Gastro bloating. - Total and severe body melt. - One small bite for visionary entrepreneur women, one giant leap for Ambassador Kind. - Yeah, well, whatever it is, I'm sure it's no-- (bold dramatic music) Big deal. (bold dramatic music) (window crashing) (bold dramatic music) No, no, no. - What's your fantasy, Bradley? - Two girls. (haunting ambient music) (Bradley yelling) (medical machines beeping) So big. So big. They were so, so big. - Good afternoon, Mr. Fortunova. Are you ready for some lunch? - No, no. No. They're so big. - How 'bout having just a little milk? (bongo drumming music) (Bradley yells) - Take it away. (Bradley yells) I can't take them anymore. (eerie whirring) - Doctors say he may never recover. And why would he want to? He may spend the rest of his days in the booby hatch. - Careful what you wish for, I guess. - Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a big deal to propose. Wish me luck. - Go get her, tiger. (light-hearted music) (foot stomps) (rocks crumble) What the hell am I getting myself into? (light-hearted music) - Ah, excuse me, Ms. Wood. - Do I know you? - Um, not really. No. - I'm kinda busy here, fella. - This'll only take a minute of your time. But I assure you, it'll be worth it. Millions, worth it. - Beat it, creep. I'm done with pervs. - I am not your everyday, run of the mill perv, trust me. - Ew. Get lost. Bye. - Hear me out. - And, you look like someone I used to know. So, double ew. - Bothering the lady, pal? This is private property. I suggest you turn around and go back the way you came. - Please listen. I can help with the bills, the lawsuits, everything. - You can pay all that off? - Are you a lawyer? - Ah, ha, I'm not that sleazy, pal. I'm a promoter. - Promoter of what? - Events of the highest end, total quality. - Name one. - Okay well, to be honest, this would be the first of this caliber. But trust me, no one has ever done this in the history of mankind. - I think you need to turn tail and get. - Let him talk. Everyone deserves a chance. - Thank you, Beverly, Miss Wood. - So, what are you proposing? - Well, 50 million bucks, win or lose. - Win or lose to what? - Does it even matter? There's nobody else like me, and I'm a crazy bitch, so. - I like that spunk. - I don't like this. It doesn't sound right. - That money sounds pretty right to me. - About right. - But, you haven't said who or what she's winning or losing against. - Winning. - It doesn't matter, Bev. It's not worth it. - (laughs) Her? Definitely winning. - You think you're so big and tough. - I am though. - The bigger they are, the harder they fall. And bitch, you're the biggest. You're gonna fall so hard, your lips are gonna flatten. - Does anyone hear that tiny, annoying little buzzing sound? Get me my fly swatter. - I'm gonna crawl up your ass, and turn you inside out. - Yeah? Well I'm gonna floss my teeth with your scrawny boy body. - You're gonna taste what the Conda is steaming. - Oh, okay, wait, we talked about this. You can't say that. - Sorry. You're going down. Way, way down. - Uh-huh. - Yeah-huh. - Uh-huh. - Uh-huh. - Nah-uh. - Uh-huh. - Okay ladies, save it for the event. - Okay. - Totally. - See you then. - Lates. - I like your helmet, FYI. - Thank you. - I, I, I don't like this at all. I, how, how is this even gonna happen? Your girl doesn't stand a chance. Beverly could seriously hurt her without trying at all. - Don't worry. Let me work out the details. - Okay. When is this supposed to go down? - Give me about a month. Okay? I need to advertise, sell tickets, promote. Anna needs to grow. - What? Say that again. - Into character. Anna needs to grow into character. - I don't like this. - You will. - This could be my out. - (sighs) I don't think so. (deep foreboding music) (electronic beeping) (soft mysterious music) (stirrer clinking) - It certainly looks like it could be the one. - Could it be? - It could. But, none of 'em have been so far. - The aroma's correct, if I recall. - It smells like Snausages. - Well then no, I was going for Gravy Train. I personally like the smell of it, and my dog Poochie loves it. - When can, when can Anna Conda try? - Well, I don't see any reason why we-- - Not yet. It isn't ready. - Well, I don't see any reason why we can't. - This is, this is, this is ludicrous. Okay, wheels are already in motion. I'm paying you money for, for results. - For the record, I am categorically opposed to any of this. It isn't right. What happened to Beverly Wood was a gross miscalculation on our part. We still don't know of any long-haul side effects. - Like total body implosion. - Would you get over the total body implosion already? - It can happen. - Yes, it could be a possibility. - Finally, you admit it. Eh. - That doesn't sound cool at all. - It isn't. - I really don't wanna melt, Brian. - Oh, oh you won't, baby. I promise-ish. - Oh, I assure you, you won't melt. If anything, total body implosion. - #HereWeGoAgain. - Okay, the minute something happens, you contact me. I got a fight to promote. (tense music) Let's go. (tense suspenseful music) (triumphant music) This is it. This is it. - Turn it up. Turn it up. - Jack Jackson here. Hot off the presses, ladies, gentlemen, and sports fans of all stripes and types. Gee whiz, I don't know where the hell this came from, or what the hell they were thinking, but I know I'll be watching. Fortunova promotions dropped word of this David and Goliath story just a few minutes ago. Featuring former socialite and social media star influencer, along with a slew of other job titles that aren't really jobs, Beverly Wood. You might remember her as the 50-foot demolitionist who crushed half the city with her hind end. She will be on the bill against newcomer, Anna Conda. Boy, I'd like to see how she got that name. In an all out, no holds barred, good old-fashioned cat fight, not unlike the one happening right behind me. The promoter calls this one "War of the Girlgantuas." Jesus Christ sucking down a fruit cup. That poor girl. Expect a blood bath here, gang. Tale of the tape says that Anna Conda stands a towering five foot nothing. She's gonna need an extra bowl of Wheaties that morning, I tell you. What's that? Conda sets her lady bubbles on fire. Folks, this might just give her the edge she needs in this bout. We're gonna have to find out. Until more freaky news rolls in, this is Jack Jackson saying, keep hitting and kicking those balls. - Oh my god. That was so exciting, to see my face on TV again. - I, I still don't know about this. - Don't know about what? That was definitely my face. - Yeah, I know that. And, it's gorgeous. But to be honest, I, I don't like any of this. I, I feel like they're exploiting you all over again. - But now I know I am. Now I can control it. - I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop. - With $50 million? The only other shoe that's gonna drop is my custom Prada. Just kidding. I'm a working girl wearing working boots. But, that money will really help us dig out and set up. - I suppose so, uh. - I know so. You deserve to be pampered too. You've been so good to me. - I don't know. - Mike, as if you didn't know it already, my entire giant heart belongs only to you. I'm never gonna go back to my old ways. You've taught me what's really important. - And what's that? - It's the little things that matter. And you're pretty little, bud. (whimsical music) (Bev laughs) (whimsical music) (Bev moaning) (drill whirring) (Bev moaning) (spacecraft roars) (computer whirring) - Computer. - [Computer] Yes? - Scan for that big little bitch. (computer imitates beeping) Gah! (hand thuds) (deep serious music) - This could be it. - Cross your digits. - This needs to happen, now. - You've said that 20 times already. - Well, this time I mean it. It's fight night! (hand smacks) - If this fails, it means you've failed. Which means I've failed. And I don't fail. You read me? - Yeah. Okay. - So, who's gonna eat it? - You care who eats it? - No. - Well then, you eat it. - No, no, no, no, no. You eat it. - No, no, no, no. You eat it. - No, no, no. I insist. - No, I insist. - I insist infinity times squared. - I got into science because I was tired of being surrounded by morons. Yet, here I am. The purpose of the experiment was to replicate and cure world hunger. The gigantism is an undesirable side effect. Don't you get it? It doesn't have to be eaten. It just has to replicate. That's the first step. If it replicates, we know we're on the right track. (deep ominous music) - Fuck that shit. I ain't eatin' that. (hotdog squeaking and whining) (wind whipping) (foot stomps) (rock crackles) - Who you betting on you? - You crazy? Of course my money's on the jolly pink giant over there. - You don't even like her. - I like making money. - What if I told you that Anna Conda gal sets her major yabos on fire for fun. - That's half the youth of today. They're nuts. I'm still betting it all on Bev. (rock thuds) - Why don't you two take a long break? (light-hearted music) Hey, Bev. - Hey, Mike. - Can you come over here so we can talk for a second? - Is everything okay? - Yeah. I, no, I, I don't know. - What is it? - This fight. There's something that's been nagging at me. I mean, you're a big girl. - Ha, ha. - You know what I mean. You're gonna make your own decisions and do what you wanna do. But I just want you to know that I wish you would reconsider. - Why is that? - (sighs) Because I care about you, that's why. Because I love you. That's also why. - Really? You've never told me that before. - Well, it needed to be said, because it's true. - Then, say it again. - I love you, Beverly Wood. - I love you too, Mike. I've wanted to tell you for so long, but I was scared of being the first person to say it. - All right, now, about this fight. - You've supported me for so long through the good and the bad. Way bad, mostly bad. - I don't think I like where this is going. - And, I'm not just doing it for me. I'm doing it for us. - I just hope you can see from my perspective. - I wish I could from this vantage point, literally, so many bald spots up here. I'm not doing this just for me. I'm doing this for us. - Well, it sounds like you've made up your mind. So let's do this the only way we know how. - And how's that? - Big. - I love you so much. I want the whole world to hear it. I love you, Mike. I love you, Mike. I love you, Mike. I love you, Mike. (glass shatters) I love you, Mike. - Computer. - [Computer] Yes? - Locate the source of that hideous sound. - [Computer] Oh, I got you, girl. (digital beeping) (upbeat music) - Gigi Randall, on location at Oil Beback Refinery. This site has been pumping crude for almost a century. But, in less than a month, the main event happening here will be a heart-pumping excitement the likes we've never seen before. This is "War of the Girlgantuas." On one side, the once popular, and now polarizing social media bombshell, Beverly Wood. 50 feet tall, and God knows how much she weighs. On the other side, rising star of the squared circle and beyond, Anna Conda. Clocking in at five-foot-four, and listen, don't ask a woman how much she weighs, okay? Just don't do it. Anyway, this is "War of the Girlgantuas." (relaxed drumming music) We're fortunate to have both opponents with us today, where both have set aside their beef for this exclusive interview. Who are we rooting for? Who is the villain? Anna, can you tell us, why did you choose this fight? Why this hill to die on? Cause you, you are gonna die. You know that, right? Beverly, same question. - I'm strictly about the money. - Fair enough. - This isn't about the money for me. Never, ever. - Then what is it, exactly? - Fame. Maybe the money. - By the way, your hair? It's crunchy. - That's something, coming from the Burlington Throat Factory. (Bev gasps) (wind whipping) - These ladies know how to go straight for the jugular. You're not gonna wanna miss this one gang. Call your pay-per-view provider today. One month away. One night only. This is "War of the Girlgantuas." Back to you, Jack. - And, there you have it, folks. Crunchy hair, don't care. Who will be victorious at the "War of the Girlgantuas?" (slow somber music) - Today is Monday the 21st. Dr. Dennis has pulled the specimen from the solution and placed it on the plate. - What trial number is this? - This is trial number 69. (Dennis and Brian laughing) - I, I, I, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What trial number is this again? - This is trial number 69. (Dennis and Brian laugh) - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's wrong, it's so wrong. - What is so funny about 69? - Nothing. - Oh, it's funny. - Nothing at all. - It's classic. Goes back to the million-- - Oh, ew. I get it. And I'm ignoring you. Traphadites. - Ah, my favorite dinosaur. - Well? - Well. - Get on with it. No failure. - Well, here goes nothing. And when I say nothing, please, please, don't be nothing. - Maybe a good luck drum roll? - Oh. - Okay. (hands slapping) - Ah! (slow tense music) (hotdog crunches) - That's uh, that's like flacid. - (sighs) Nothing. - And now we commence trial number 70. Any jokes about that one? - Oh no, because you know why? 70's not funny. - Because I've always thought 70 is a much livelier number. Am I right ladies? (Anna yelling) (electricity buzzing) - What's goin' on? - Ooh, ooh, ooh. (electricity buzzing) - Oh, oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh! - And 69 it is. - Incredible. - It's inedible. - Oh! No, no, no. - Oh, no. No, no, no. Oh god, no. I said incredible, not edible. - [Brian] So, what now? - Total body implosion. (tense music swells) (wind whipping) (water splashes) - What gives? - If we're gonna go through with this, you gotta be prepared. Get up. Let's get cracking. I'm gonna teach you to wrestle, how to box, and how to bite. (bold inspirational music) Chicks don't fight fair, believe me. If you're gonna box, want your hands up high, guard your head, right? All right, don't throw out here, 'cause then they're gonna hit you right here. Tight. Tight, everything's tight. All right? Just don't, don't throw one punch, throw multiple punches. One, two, three, four. All right? Then do it fast. All right? Got you punching, and now, I want you to throw a kick, all right? Straightforward. (fist thuds) All right, you wanna go straight at her. Right in her nose. (foot thuds) (toy truck whizzing) (toy truck crashes) - Nice wrecking boot. - Yeah, beats what we got. - And if she comes running at you, you're gonna wrestle, she's gonna come try to grab you, and you want duck down, grab and come up and then, slam her down. (fists thud) (bold inspirational music) This is not gonna be easy. That's good. (chuckles) (gentle music) (electricity buzzing) (Dennis chuckles) - Holy Carl Sagan. - Say again. - Holy Carl Sagan. We've done it. Yes! We can get Beverly back to normal. (laughs) (spacecraft whirring) - Computer. - [Computer] What? - Location of the source. - [Computer] Girl, I don't even know. - Do it. - [Computer] God, I was paying my so cutes. I call 'em that because they're so cute. - Now! - [Computer] Okay, geez. Go that-a way. No, that-a way. - Your ass is mine now, bitch. - [Computer] Yeah! - Ah! - Miss Wood, Miss Wood, Beverly. - Hey. - We did it, we really did it. - Congratulations. I knew you wouldn't die a virgin. - Oh, well, ew. That wasn't what I was talking about. Not even close. - I'm sure there's still time. - Beverly, we've successfully recreated the mystery modified protein. - Beverly Wood's Unholy-- - Meatrimony. I know, I know. Yes, that one. - I named-- - All by yourself. What an achievement. The point is, the re-experiment is a success. The hotdog replicated. - Whoo-hoo. - (scoffs) Honestly, I'm a bit shocked. I thought you'd be beside yourself. - I'm one big bitch, not two. - I don't think you're quite grasping this, so let me be more specific. This means we can reverse engineer the specimen. - Beverly Wood's Unholy-- - Stop it. Just stop it. It's literally the worst name for a world-changing product ever. - I liked it. I thought it was rad. - You would. - Beverly Wood. (Lana sighs) - Experiment success. You, small, now. (fingers snap) - You mean you successfully recreated the meat experiment and reverse synthesized it so that I can be a normal-sized human again? - Yes, exactly. - Why didn't you just say that? - I really don't know. - Yay. Goodbye, big bitch. Hello, shoe and panties shopping free. - Yay. Retail therapy. (laughs) - Could this thing work? - Per our calculations, I'm confident to a 1/10th of a percentile of a 100% success. This can and will happen, baby. (giggles) - Hmm. - What's wrong? I thought this is what you wanted. - More than anything in the world, to be normal sized again, to really be with Mike. - Then why the #SadFace? - The fight, it's tomorrow. - Then hold off. - We really need the money. Look at me, I'm shaking. - That explains the tremors. - Screw it. How soon can we do this? - How soon can you be at my lab? - Color me gone, and pink. (deep tense music) (spacecraft roaring) (tense ominous music) (computer laughs) - Ah! (spacecraft swooshes) (wind whipping) - A tall-stack snack. Where are you? A little something for good luck tomorrow. Not that you're gonna need it. And uh, show you how much I love you. Bev, honey? My tall-stack snack. Where are you? (wind whipping) There you are. (intriguing music) - Not who you were expecting, huh? - What the hell is this? - The edge I needed. - Oh, this is not good. You don't know what you're messing with. - I do, and I love it. I have always been bigger than life. A woman eventually grows into herself. I just needed a little something to get me there. - You're even bigger than she is now. - 60 feet and worth the climb. - Well wait, if, if, if the doctors made you tall, then maybe they could reverse it. - Why would anybody not want this? - No, it is a curse. Trust me. - Spoken like the little bug of a man that you are. - Does, does Beverly know about this, about you? - Wanted to reveal myself just before the fight. Watch her cower. (laughs) The ultimate mind fuck. Where is she? - I wish I knew. - She better not be a no-show tomorrow, or else. - Or else, what? - Or else this. (screaming) (Anna yelling) (buildings crashing) (Anna yells) (foot stomps) (Anna yells) (buildings crashing) (Anna yells) (adventurous music) (Anna yells) (adventurous music) (objects crash) (Anna yells) - And here we are, sports fans, the day of judgment known around the world as "War of the Girlgantuas." Beverly Wood, Anna Conda, an epic cat fight taking place right here at Oil Beback Refinery. Who will be victorious and who will be suffering the agony of the defetish? Sorry, Freudian slip there. Who will suffer the agony of defeminism? Ah, that sounds bad too. Again. Who will be going home with their tail between their legs? Eh, shit. Eh, fuck it. Keep it. Nobody cares about me anymore. Let's check in with our opponents. Shall we? (crowd cheering) - I knew it. She's too chicken to show. - Oh no, she's around here somewhere. - Do you see her? I mean, you can't really miss her. - She's here. All right, she's gonna show. She's probably getting a pep talk from her little rock digger friend. She's scared. You've got the element of surprise. Nobody, nobody could have expected you. All of you. - What if she doesn't show? I'll look stupid. - If she doesn't, she forfeits, and a win is a win. - I came here for a glorious bloodbath! This is not a glorious bloodbath! (crowd chattering) (tense music) (steam sizzles) - Jack Jackson reporting on this colossal event of epic proportions, breaking all reported pay-per-view records. There are a lot of freaks out there in the home audience, all tuning in for-- (glass clinks) (intense music) Beverly Wood, Anna Conda. Who will survive, and what will be left of them? The main event starts right here, right now. Let's get to it. - Hey, where the hell is she? - No idea. - Well find her. You know how much is riding on this. (tense music) - Do you think we're safe standing here? - Absolutely, no question about it. - So, were you able to shrink her down? - Trust me, just stay with me. (anticipatory music) - Hope you didn't do anything stupid, Bev. - We seem to be missing one of the girls. Beverly Wood is missing. - She's too scared to show her face without a filter? Come on! I wanna fight somebody? Who wants to come down and tussle? I don't wanna waste my murder mode. (spacecraft roaring) (daunting music) (screen buzzes) - Greetings, sluts. I have traveled the reaches of time and space to meet the call of battle. - Oh my god. - I don't even know what the hell this is, but let's watch and find out. - You will answer that call, or I will hang up on your ass. - Who the hell are you? - I am Spa-Zor, reigning warrior champion of Buxomus and beyond. - Space Whore? - Fool! Another slip of the tongue and you will be choked with it, for I am Spa-Zor. - That's what I said, Space Whore. - Spa-Zor! - Yeah, Space Whore. - Insolence. - In a serious turn of events, a space whore, presumably a whore from space, has challenged our lone contestant. This could be pretty cool. - You will accept my challenge, or you will die. Well, accept or not, and you will die. The choice is not yours. Get it? Tramp. - Shut your space whore mouth, and get your ass down here and face me like a real woman. - A real woman? Nay, for I am not passive aggressive. I'm aggressive aggressive. - Get your ass down here. - You will soon feel my wrath, earth insect, Beverly Wood. - Beverly Wood? I'm not Beverly Wood. I'm Anna Conda. - Lies. For there's only one giant amongst your kind, and it is thy, Beverly Wood. - You've got the wrong bitch, bitch. - You will do battle with me, or all will suffer the consequences of your cowardice. And when I win, I will bring your head to my home planet as a trophy. And all your wussy race will be enslaved. Earth will bite the big one. (laughs) - And if I win? - You will not. - It's up to you, baby. - For every 13 Earth seconds you make me wait for a decision, I will destroy a beloved monument of your people. - Why 13 seconds? That's so random. - Deal with it! Space to Earth time conversion is a real bitch. To prove the gravity of the situation, behold. (laser buzzes) (stone explodes) How do you like those space apples? - I kinda like it. - Time is running out. - You have to listen to me. I am Anna Conda, not Beverly Wood. - Three, two, one. Time's up. (laser buzzes) (rock explodes) - It's kind of a fetish, right? - Do you heed the warrior's call? - I'm thinking. 'Cause I kinda like how you're redecorating. - Three, two, one. Gotcha! (rock explodes) - No! - Had enough? - I'm telling you, you've got the wrong girl. I am Anna Conda, not Beverly Wood. - I don't care if you're Gertrude McGillicutty. Fight me or perish. - You kinda gotta do it, right? No fight, no money. - This isn't about the money. This is about saving Earth. - Whatever fills your jugs, babe. - Okay, space snatch. Let's rumble. - I thought you'd never ask. Whoo! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. (spacecraft swooshing) (electricity buzzing) (hands clap) Shall we? - Hell yeah. (bold adventurous music) (Anna groaning) - Oh, oh my god. (bold adventurous music) (Spa-Zor grunts) (bold adventurous music) - It's the battle of the planet. The battle of the planet! (women grunting and groaning) (bold adventurous music) (laser hisses) That's an alien thing. That's not fair. (bold adventurous music) (women grunting and groaning) (bold adventurous music) (Spa-Zor grunts) - Give up yet? - Never! - I knew you were a dumb-ass hoe. Your head is gonna look so good above my mantle! - Hey. - God, your timing sucks, Bev. - Get off my planet, bitch. - Who the fuck are you? (intense music) (oil explodes) (steel clangs) (intense music) (women grunting) - Bev, I love you, Beverly. I believe in you! (oil sploshing) (bold daunting music) (women grunting) Yeah! (Spa-Zor cries out) (Anna grunts) - Girl, you're done. Tits up. - You must do what needs to be done. - I promised my boyfriend I wouldn't get stupid drunk anymore. - Not that, the ultimate finish. - Pee in the street, then crawl home. - You dumb-ass hoes. - Then what? - You must end me! - Here? Everyone's watching. - Kill me! You have to kill me! For the love of Petunia. - Ew. - Not ew, it is the warrior's way. Do not shame me by killing me like some totally lame loser. - Hold that thought. What are we gonna do with her? - I say we oft the bitch. - Ew, harsh. - [Anna] That's what she wants. - What Mike taught me about being an actually good person is you can't always get what you want. - Yeah, Bev. Whoo! - Holy moley, folks. This was the most amazing thing I've ever seen. I don't think I'm gonna be forgetting about it anytime soon. Are you? Of course you won't. This is Jack Jackson closing out the show here at Oil Beback Refinery. - All she needs is a really good spanking. - I think you're right. (hands slapping) (spacecraft whirring) Good riddance. - Yay, Earth. (laughs) (Dennis laughs) Mm. - Oh really now? - That was one and done. I'm just so happy to be living another day. (laughs) - I'll allow it. - Congratulations! (laughs) You know what just came to me? I think I can get you two double-booked in Vegas. - That's what happens when friends set aside their differences, right? - Are we friends now? - Yes. Best of besties. - Yay, I've never had one! - Great job, ladies. I am so proud of both of you. Hey everyone, we're all gonna get laid.
