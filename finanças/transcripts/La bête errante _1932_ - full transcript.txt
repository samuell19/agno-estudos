The wandering beast To all wanderers, to all hunters of the impossible, I offer these pages lived below the Arctic Circle. Dawson, at the confluence of the Yukon and the Klondike, extreme North of Canada. What is it? - A glass of milk. What? - Milk! Milk. Understand? Maybe he needs a feeding-bottle too! I'm going to give him a lesson, watch out. Barman. Milk please. Man to man. There's Joe sure looking for trouble again. Oh, boy, what a hurricane. Say, that guy's a character. Oh, boy! Now give me my milk. With pleasure. Here you are, Sir. And a whisky for him. So, my boy, you came to try your luck? - As you can see. You're new here? I've been around for six months. And business is good? I mean, are you happy? You know, all places are the same to me. - I see. Not that great, huh? Smoky! Damn dog! Come here! You want some help? - With pleasure, comrade. Come on, Smoky, don't pull so hard! Slow down, Smoky, There's not much left here. Unharness them, please, it would be very kind of you. Come on, go easy! They'd like a drink, my kiddos. There, kiddos. Take your places. Come on, drink. So, you're leaving tomorrow? - No, after tomorrow, at dawn. You're going back to Dawson. - No. I'm going to the Far North, following the river. You can come with me, if you feel like it. Yes, I'd like to. I've had enough pecking the ground like a hen. Say, Jim Bass is offering 500 dollars for my concession. 500? - What do you think? - It's a nice sum, you should sell, my boy. If you feel like it, day after tomorrow at 6, I'll pick you up with my sled. Say, what a nice dog you have here. A nice dog as stubborn as a mule! Say, would you sell it to me? Me, sell a dog! Do I look like a dog trader? Come on! Loneliness made you lose your mind, my boy. Yeah... You're new. You don't know. Dog trader! Here. - Thanks. Tell me the truth. How did you end up here? You're not running away from the police by any chance? - Not at all. So you simply want to make a fortune? - Purely and simply. It's because of a woman. A young girl. You love her? - Of course. What about her? She loves you too? - Probably, but one can never be sure. You see, my Dolly is the story of my life. Problem is she's impulsive and impatient. With her men must succeed quickly. That's why I... That's why you're here sweet-talking under this ideal climate. My poor boy, believe me... All your pretty girls are not worth a good tobacco pipe. Waste no time, go sell your concession. And after tomorrow, we leave at 6. You like him, huh? - Sure! - I'm not selling him, I'm giving him to you. Hi, Jim! You got a second? - Yes. - Mind your back! You feel better? - Yes. - Fine. I've made up my mind. I'm selling. Still 500 dollars? - Yes, alright. Jacob, lend me your scales. I'm not lending. - Come on, give it to me. Here's for you, old skinflint. Boss! Three whiskies. - OK. We never see you around. You don't want to dance? Well, I used to dance... Where? Here and there. I used to dance and drink a lot. But now it's over. - But why? Come on, leave this boy alone! It's not a boy, it's a girl! Hey, leave us alone! - You can keep your whore for yourself. Apologize to her! Apologize to her! - I beg your pardon. Thank you. Come dance with me. No, I don't feel like it. It's always the same. Every time I'm attracted to a guy, he says no. You like me? Yes. You're leaving? - Yes. You'll be back tomorrow? - No. I'm leaving after tomorrow with Gregory. For a long time? For ever. To the Far North # Drive, drive, drive, ever onwards and then some more Just out of reach are those burning log fires Drive, drive, drive, ever onwards and then some more Just out of reach are those girls to adore A few months later. Close the door, for christ sake! So, any news? No, the mail from Dawson was delayed because of the snow. My poor hat... Enough! 49 below zero. That's something! Villi, come on, sing. It'll be better for us. Come on, Villi, get up! We're leaving! Come on, hurry, we're leaving! Go harness the dogs! - Where are we going? Where are we going? - We're going to meet Gregory on the trail. No, thanks. It will warm us up. Hey, guys, here comes Gregory! Not too soon, old pal. We were starting to worry about you. A double punch for me! Now for my dogs, meat, fish, old boots... Anything you have as long as they eat. Don't worry, I'll fix it for them. - They sure deserve it, you know. 45 miles since this morning. Snow up to the sky, avalanches... At least you made it through, buddy. - As you say. Three weeks on the trail, he took some serious shit. What's up, honey? Dogs first. Here's the water. My knife! Teddy! Some meat, fish, gimme all you have. Here's some meat. - That's it. Light me up. I'll fix a plate for you. I'll give it to them. Come on, kiddos! Now it's your turn! Coleville! Hand it to Grisou, I'll give it to him. - Alright. - Thanks. Martin! - Right here! Harp! Miss Betty! Wait kiddo, there are two more letters. - The girl is spoiled! I'm here. - Pass him his letter. Here's for you my little, Daddy Pratt! That's me. Glewood! - Glewood? Back home, after making a fortune. At last! That's it, it's over. - Already? You'll be more fortunate next time! I had nothing for you, my boy. Whisky? - Whisky or gin, it's all the same. It's yours? - I'm keeping them. I'll need your help. I know I can trust you. But... you might be risking your skin. What do you want me to do? Stay here and keep your eyes open. Listen to me, mates! Shut up, we can't hear him. - Silence! Stop your music. Take him out. Now, listen to me. I'm sorry to interrupt you in your enjoyment but I have a very serious thing to tell you. Answer me. Who has left camp during the last 8 days? That's why you're interrupting us! - Silence! I'll ask again. Who has left camp in the last 8 days? There are Rolf and Gr?goire. Anyone can give me news about Glewood? Glewood? He must be pretty far away now and still running, I suppose. He left us 6 days ago. No, Glewood doesn't run anymore. Glewood doesn't run anymore. He's dead. I found him in a ravine. With a bullet in the head! Murdered! I'm telling the truth! I found him in the snow yesterday. - Who is the murderer? There are his papers. Boys! The murderer is here amongst us! There are the dead man's snowshoes! With his name etched on the wood! Glewood Back off, all of you! I want nobody behind the bar! Hands up! How touchy you are, my dear old friend! But we've got no designs on your money. What do you want from me then? I didn't leave my bar. Tell him, it's the truth! Who says differently? Show us your snowshoes! Come on, hurry! Pipo Malatesta has left for two days. He came back exhausted the day before yesterday and slept for 20 hours. Who is Pipo Malatesta? Don't let him get away! Keep an eye on this one. And you there, watch the door! Come on, my friend. Bring him over here. I want the three oldest guys to set up a tribunal. It's useless. I did it. I know the price. I'm ready to pay. A beginner like you can't cover a trail. It's not possible. Who advised you? That guy over there. Enough! Back down! Have mercy! Don't hang me! Mercy? Did you have mercy on Glewood? What about his two kids crying now? You had pity on them? Come on, quick! Bring him over here. What a coward! Are you ready, boys? The rope's strong enough? Do it! And now, the other. A moment, please. Say, boys... I'd like to be hung listening to music. A little tune, if you don't mind. Kid... Do you have parents or friends to inform? Nope. Ready, up there? Do it! In case you're interested by those mags. I must warn you though... They're two months old. If you learn about the death or marriage of one of your friends, don't send your condolences. It's too late now. You had nothing in the mail for me, right? You're sure? Bag's empty. I have the blues... Understand me. I haven't received anything from her for two months. Absolutely nothing. Where is she? What she's doing? I don't know. If you let yourself go down with the blues in this country, you're done for, my boy. I'll reckon that little show from earlier is not the best to help you cheer up. What's that noise? Oh, that, my boy, it's probably a guy celebrating his departure. Because he has made a fortune. You see, in this place, enjoyment is always close to death. What's wrong with you? So what? - It's her, you see! It's her, Dolly! It's for her love that I'm here! Ten months in hell, heart eaten out more and more every day. For sole reward, what? This life. And for whom? She couldn't wait for me, so first she stopped writing. Now I know the reason, she's a star now, a movie star! It's really depressing! Don't let it get you down! Cheer up! For the rest, well, God willing, there's nothing that can't be healed with some will. - So they say... And they're right! Newbie! So you think you're the center of the world because your broad has stopped sending you pretty lies on perfumed paper! You're suffering! And us? We don't exist? We're not suffering? The blues you have, we all have it inside us! More or less. But we're drowning it in gin. Come on, let's go meet the others. Let's go laugh, drink, sing and forget the rest. Silence, mates! Igor is offering a round to all the Alaskan girls around! Sergio, come here. Bring us some wine. Tonight we need a little sunshine in our hearts. Bring the best from your cellar, old scoundrel. - Alright. Show me your passport. It's okay with me. Just when I'm short-handed. You will do nicely. Rita, go up with her, have her dressed and show her the job right away. Make her look sexy. - My passport?. - I keep it. Make her look sexy. - Alright. Villi can dance. Villi can dance too. Let's go Villi can, he really can. He's so handsome. Villi can really dance tonight. You'll do some damage with those eyes. - Really? Put on some eye-liner. Some lipstick too. More music, give us more music! - Shut up and keep quiet. What's up? You're not feeling fine? You need a woman? - Leave me alone. Sergio, two gins. You're not in a convent here, don't be afraid Put more make-up on your eyes and lips. Look at me. It adds character. Men like it. And you look sad. You'll see, it's not that hard, working here. Come on, laugh! Men like when women laugh. I'll give you something to help you laugh. I come from the South. That's where I'm born. There's sun everywhere and all year long. Show me your magazine. Look at that pretty woman. And this one! And that one! A young girl from high society, making her first movie. If I was pretty like that, I wouldn't work at all! Her name is Dolly, just like you! - Let me see. Oh, yes, she's really lovely. Oh, gee! If only she was here, she wouldn't stay a virgin for long. As if a high class girl like her is waiting for you to show her the way to heaven! Stop! Stop! Bloody savages! You're crazy, my boy! It's unbelievable! All that racket for a... It's you, Flossie? How did you make it here? - I got here tonight with the mail. So, my boy, you've sobered up now? You did a bloody good job there! Well, it's too late anyways. I see you two have already met. Everything's fine. You think so? I don't! I won't stay another second in that hellish place! Listen, I'm leaving tomorrow night for the Far North with my last bags of mail. Then I'm back down to Dawson. You'll come with me. - But... What is it, Flossie? - You promised to drive me further out. How many of you? We're two. But it can work. You can even bring your Indian. He will follow behind us in your sled. OK? It's fine with me. - We'll have to replace the dogs. You see, I was right, kiddos. We'll go straight ahead but tomorrow get back to the trail. Don't worry, I know all about the place. Come on, mate, follow us! The thaw, the greatest menace of the frozen wastes. Here, you'll fly the sled. Avalanches await us up there. Let's hurry. It's time to leave. No, it's too dangerous to leave now. Avalanche! Villi, the dogs! - Me, not happy! - Come on Villi, stop that! Lost Hurricane, come on! Come on, Smoky, jump! Take Smoky with you, he's not feeling well. What a cold, kiddos! I think we've reached a place where no man has come since the disappearance of the mammoths eons ago. I only hope we won't end the same. If only that damn storm would stop! It will be all over us for hours. - Let's wait here until it stops. No, we'll have to leave in a few hours. We have almost nothing to eat. We must leave at all costs. They're exhausted. They have made too many efforts for too long. We must abandon a sled or else... Slowly, slowly, my boy! We must keep the mail! We'll have to abandon that sled. Take courage, my dear. It's going to work, you'll see. You're ready? Come on, let's go! Let's go this way. In front of the snow. Days... Get up, my girl. Do you have the strength to walk? What misery! That was to be expected. Hope... How is he? Better. He's still delirious? Yes, he always say the same words. Alright, alright... - It's not alright! I didn't mean that. I have to leave, but don't worry. The boy is doing much better. He's out of danger now. My mind is at peace, knowing you'll stay with him. I'm sure he'll heal much better with you by his side. - Hopefully. Say, kiddo... I'm sorry, but I found at the bottom of my bag that letter for him. A letter. - Yes, it was lost amongst other papers. I hadn't seen it. So, I... I'll hand it to him. That's it. I'm leaving now. It's bothering me to leave you alone. Are you armed? - Yes. You're a courageous girl. You've nothing to be afraid of anyway. Our saviors will be back soon. They went to check their traps. They'll be back before nightfall. My dear boy... When will we meet again? So long, Flossie. Treat him well. - Sure. Flossie? I've been very sick, right? Yes, but you're better now. Where are we? We're safe at the trappers who have welcomed us. And Gregory? - He went away. How long since we're here? Two weeks. - Two weeks.... Nothing new? One thing. I have a letter for you. A letter? Ah, Flossie... Forgive me, Flossie. Forgive me if I've hurt you. Keep quiet. You'll leave when you feel better. One must always follow one's heart. All these stories about lost girls! How thrilling! So, is it true that Gregory saved the bags and threw away the goods? You don't believe that nonsense, I hope. Dear friend. But where is he? - You're looking for your guest? You really like that boy? - I confess, yes. He's the shoulders and hands of a cow-boy. Did you get a good look at his hands? Have you seen my bear? - Your bear? Who is it? Oh, I see. No, we haven't seen him yet. Dolly, my dear, I find that boy absolutely charming. He's not used to parties, you know. In your place, I would be afraid of that man. - Afraid of him? What a funny idea! - A cigarette, Miss Dolly? But... look, he's here! So he heard us talking. Well, my dear, come with us. I'm so peaceful here. So, what about your guest? - Still chained. Like a wandering beast? - Yes, but I tamed him. Bravo, Dolly the tamer! It would make a good script for your next movie. A wild brute who needs to be domesticated. These two little hands will take care of it. - What if the brute fights back? All for the best! We will fight and the movie will be more exciting! You think so? - I'm sure of it. What makes you so sure? What if the brute don't want to be tamed? My dear, mind your manners, we're not in Alaska here. What if I don't want to? Alaska... Yes, I went there because of you. For you I went through many discouragements and despairs. You're not exactly in a position to scold the man you turned me into. The gold I looked for wasn't for me but for you. Ah, Dolly... You're not much. - You're a boor! My dear friend, don't go too far! What! You're talking to me? Have some too! What a brute! Come on, bunch of cowards! Come and get your trashing! You dare not. It's the bear who tames the pack. Don't you think it would make a better script? Hello, star! You say nothing? Did the brute properly trash your little men? Understand me, I want to exit in style. # Drive, drive, drive ever onwards and then some more Just out of reach are those burning log fires Drive, drive, drive ever onwards and then some more Just out of reach are those girls to adore Drive, drive, drive ever onwards and then some more Just out of reach are those burning log fires Drive, drive, drive ever onwards and then some more Just out of reach are those girls to adore You're a funny guy, you know. I'm very happy to see you again. I'm very happy but, I can't stop thinking that you're a funny guy. It's a bit thick! You really must be mad to come back. Maybe. I think I'm a wandering beast. I was longing for that life uncertain, that life of adventure that I'd tried. I like those uncertainties of tomorrow, that horizon. Don't count on me to disapprove of you. If only I hadn't left behind me that brave little Flossie, my happiness would be complete tonight. - Obviously. You couldn't ask her permission to leave. Unfortunately. However... - What? You still don't get it, huh? I'm certain that brave kid would have been very happy to follow you. That damn wind! What foul weather! We won't be able to leave before tomorrow morning. We'll have to spend another night in this shack. We've been hiding like rats for three days. Someone's on the trail? With weather like that they must be fed up to the back teeth. Maybe the police. They have to stop here or they'd have to face 60 miles of desert. It would be suicide. They're stopping. They don't have dogs. It's gotta be hard. I'm afraid we're going to be tight for the night. All right, all right! Hi. - Hi. Really! I was sure we'd meet again on the road! My little Flossie! What are you doing here? - What about you? Well, I don't really know. - How is it possible? Come on, kiddos, don't try to figure out why you're here. What matters is that you're both here. Give me a hand, mate. - Yes, with pleasure. Is that area free? - Yes, put your stuff there. The dogs are alright? - Yes, they're fine. We'll be leaving early tomorrow morning. - Same for us. Where are you going now? Me? I don't know. That's exactly where we're going. # Drive, drive, drive ever onwards and then some more Just out of reach are those burning log fires translation: aloysius70 timings + proofreading: corvusalbus
