Hello, guys, can you make one line? One straight line, please. Thanks. One line, please. Straight ahead. Thank you. Good morning. Where are you from? -Argentina. Spanish? We're from Norway, but we can take it in English. We don't have Norwegian, I'm sorry. -That's okay, thank you. Brazil. -Portuguese? May I have one in German? -Of course. Where are you from? -United States. How long do we have to stand in line? -An hour and a half, I estimate. An hour and a half? -Yes. At least it's not raining. On your left side you can see the Anne Frank House. This is where Anne Frank hid for two years together with her family... and where she wrote her famous diary. The Frank family lived in Germany until 1933. When Adolf Hitler came to power, the family moved to Amsterdam. Anne is probably the best-known victim of the Second World War. Her family took refuge here, in the Annex. The secret entrance was hidden behind a bookcase. Every year, over a million people stand in line in front of the Anne Frank House. 'Writing a diary is a really strange experience for someone like me. Not only because I've never written anything before... but also because it seems to me that later on neither I nor anyone else... will be interested in the musings of a 13-year-old schoolgirl. I feel like writing and have an even greater need... to get all kinds of things off my chest.' 'I don't think I'll ever really feel at home here. But that absolutely doesn't mean I'm unhappy to be here.' It rather feels like I'm on holiday in a very strange kind of pension. I realise that it's a rather odd view of life in hiding... but that's how things are and I can't change them.' 'In the evening when it is dark... I often see long lines of good, innocent people accompanied by crying children. Walking on and on, ordered about by a handful of men... who bully and beat them until they nearly drop. No one is spared. The sick, the elderly... children, babies and pregnant women, are all marched to their death.' I'm also a survivor of the Second World War. I was a child from a Jewish family... that had come from Germany in 1933 to Holland, to escape from Hitler. Unfortunately, we stayed in Holland as the Germans came in. So by 1942 my father and mother decided they had to hide. We were separated from our parents and lived in the attic of the home. To me it was all terrible. Separation from parents, afraid all the time of being discovered. Not being able to go to school, not living a normal life. Occasionally we'd get postcards. Rarely visits from my mother in the evenings, when she dared to go out. She would take off her Jewish star and travel illegally to visit us. Until June 1944... at which time they were caught and sent to concentration camps. My father and mother were caught on D-Day. The man that hid them was executed immediately. They were sent to Westerbork, the Dutch transit camp... and then to Theresienstadt. But when they found out that my father needed insulin... he was sent on to Auschwitz with 1500 others who needed medicines. Most of whom... 1493 of them died. My mother managed to survive by stealing potatoes. When my mother returned... we lived together in Eindhoven, waiting to go to the United States on a visa. I remember riding on the back of a bicycle with her... and telling her that I was so happy she was back. Of course I was absolutely delighted that she had survived. I told her that she was back and this allowed me to become a child again. I could play and enjoy and be happy and go to school and feel normal. 'Today I have nothing but dismal and depressing news to report. Our Jewish friends and acquaintances are being taken away in droves. The treatment they receive is far from kind. They are transported in cattle cars to Westerbork, the big camp in Drenthe.' 'It must be terrible in Westerbork. People get almost nothing to eat, much less to drink... as water is only available one hour a day... and there is only one toilet and sink for several thousand people. Men and women sleep in the same room... and women and children often have their heads shaved.' I thought I should finally see what it was like. See what it would remind me of... and sort of honour her. Because she was really a terrific young woman. It's such a shame that she was killed. I feel very badly... but I've never been able to go to a Holocaust Museum... or any of the other activities, because it's so painful to me. We're Kurds from Iraq. We fled from Saddam Hussein in 1988. We had to flee to the Iranian border and go into hiding there. We lived in hiding just like Anne. We didn't have anything to eat or drink. There were dead and wounded everywhere. Children lost their parents... while being on the run to find a safe place. At one point we had to dig a hole in order to hide ourselves. There wasn't any air inside the hole. We climbed in by means of a ladder. No one dared to go out. We were desperate. We'd lost everything. We didn't know where our family or friends were. We were completely isolated from the outside world. It's tough to be on the run. You never feel safe. You think you can die at any moment... and that your future is hopeless. Now we feel safe and free. We've come to the Anne Frank House to become even more conscious of that. In our own country it's safe now. So we're here as tourists. By visiting the Anne Frank House... we hope we won't forget our past. 'Escape is almost impossible. Many people are marked by their shaved heads and by their Jewish looks as well. If it's this bad in Holland... what must it be like in those faraway places where the Germans send them? We assume most of them are being murdered. The English radio talks about gassing. Perhaps that's the quickest way to die. It all makes me feel terrible.' To walk through this house where eight people once lived... who unfortunately had to suffer this tragedy... makes you want to cry. Anne Frank brought me back to 25 years ago. I felt the pain again that I felt as a child. Everything I lived through comes to the surface again. I find it very difficult. What moved me the most is that I read that Anne Frank once wrote: 'In order to build a future, you can't forget the past'. I'm here, on this special day, to visit the Anne Frank House. And at the same time to take part in these festivities. There are parallels between Anne Frank's life and mine. Just like Anne Frank wanted to go outside... to laugh, to shout, to ride her bicycle, I wanted to do so too. We had a very hard time in Paraguay. The military was in power back then. If a child was 'different', the family got punished. Gays in Paraguay were heavily discriminated against. It was unacceptable during the dictatorship. We couldn't meet up with friends or visit each other's homes. If we did get together, there'd always be infiltrators... who told the police what we did and what we thought. So we were totally oppressed. Gays were often abused on the street by the police. Gays were killed on the street. Anne Frank took refuge in her diary. I wanted to shout and tell my family and friends: 'I'm August√≠n, this is how I feel. You should respect and accept me. Love me the way I am, because I love everyone the way they are.' That's why Anne Frank, especially to me... is a symbol of resistance and freedom. 'Not being able to go outside upsets me more than I can say. I'm terrified our hiding place will be discovered and we'll be shot. That's a fairly dismal prospect, of course.' It was an important lesson for me. Anne is a great example. I can say that right now I feel... that I shouldn't be afraid any longer... ignoring what I feel, ignoring what I am. It has strengthened my conviction that we shouldn't be afraid anymore. Of nothing and no one. We have to be free. We came to the Netherlands... because I've always wanted to visit my grandfather's grave. I'm the first person in my family to do so. The next day we came to Amsterdam. That's why I'm here. My grandfather served in a Signals Unit. It was very tragic. In 1944 it had been quiet in Holland for a long time. My grandfather had to climb up a pole. A low-flying aircraft came and shot him down. He fell down to the ground and died in a military hospital. My father was the eldest son... and took over the role of my grandfather. He never talked about it. He never really dealt with it. Only when he fell ill, he suddenly had the time... to think about it. But he never got over it. No, it was... a dark tunnel he never got out of. He used to be such a fun-loving man, but it was as if he was trapped. We couldn't get through to him anymore. We couldn't help him. My father committed suicide eight years ago... because of that terrible time in his youth. He couldn't come to terms with it. He couldn't get over it. 'Fine specimens of humanity, those Germans. To think I'm one of them! No, that's not true, Hitler took away our nationality long ago. Besides, there are no greater enemies than the Germans and the Jews.' I'm very sad. I could cry at the moment, the way I feel. Thinking of what Anne Frank and all her friends had to go through. It should never have happened or happen again. It has moved me so much. I can't put it into words. I think my grandfather had to fight for something... he thoroughly despised. He also had a family at home and children he loved. My father was just a child and he never talked about it. He never talked about the war. He couldn't come to terms with the past and didn't see a future for himself. I'm here with my wife. He's here as support. We're here to see the Anne Frank House. Annie read about it. I read about Anne Frank when I was just a little girl. I read all about her diaries and wanted to come to Amsterdam to see her house. We only have a couple of hours. -Red Light District tonight. That's for me. We Tibetans live under the harsh regime of mighty China. We also struggle for freedom. Anne Frank is an example of that. She's very important to our struggle and gives us hope. That's why we're here today to visit the Anne Frank House. I was still very young, only about five years old, when China invaded Tibet. Around a million Tibetans died during the occupation. My mother was one of them. We always lived in fear. We never knew when the Chinese would attack and kill us. The Tibetans didn't know what to do. In the end many people decided that fleeing was the best option. If we stayed in Tibet, we wouldn't survive. Everyone wanted to flee. My father wanted to leave Tibet as well. My father did his best to protect us day and night. We were on the run for days. Finally we ended up in Nepal. I'm very sad. It was a terrible situation. My mind is often in confusion and it's hard to control my anger. Sometimes I get very angry... but Buddhism helps me to keep that anger under control. The struggle Anne waged also applies to us Tibetans. It shows that we have to keep up our struggle till Tibet is free. 'I see the eight of us in the Annex... as if we were a patch of blue sky, surrounded by menacing black clouds. The spot we stand on is still safe, but the clouds are moving in on us... and the ring between us and the approaching danger... is being pulled tighter and tighter.' 'Whenever someone comes in from outside... with the wind in their clothes and the cold on their cheeks... I feel like burying my head under the blankets to keep from thinking: 'When will we be allowed to breathe fresh air again?' Believe me, if you've been shut up for a year and a half... it can get to be too much for you sometimes.' Anne Frank wasn't born in Amsterdam. She was born in Frankfurt to Jewish parents. They fled to Amsterdam after Hitler rose to power. It clearly wasn't going to be safe for a Jewish family in Germany... and Amsterdam had a history of tolerance and hospitality to Jews. They came here to the office space of Otto Frank's business... where they stayed for two years in hiding, hoping to survive the war. What I have seen makes me sad. I didn't know her story very well. I think it was unjust how she got treated. And only because of her faith. We shouldn't judge each other by our faith, but by our humanity. Anne Frank was still so young. She saw how bad the situation was, but she continued to have faith. She wrote about the problems of the Jews... and now the whole world can read what she wrote. We too have to continue to have faith in a good ending, just like Anne Frank. In the end the Jewish people were saved. I have faith that the same will happen to Tibet. What is your language? Dutch? Can you wait one moment, please? I grew up in a time of extreme racial polarization in the United States. In the time that I grew up in, there was a lot of racial oppression. Black people were the floor mat of the United States. So that's when we became acquainted with the plight of Anne Frank. We knew about the Nazi presence... and the Nazi impact on so many people. But it was more or less an introduction... to this particular family... which mirrored what had happened to many families... not only in Europe... but to many families in the United States and around the world. Especially before 1965, if you were considered to be a 'nigger'... especially in the southern part of the United States... you did not have the same privileges as whites. There were separate water fountains. So there was a black and a white water fountain. If you wanted to go to school, there was a black and a white school. But the black school was unequal and underdeveloped. There weren't the same kind of facilities. Everything was second-class... that I experienced during that time. And my wife too. You felt shame. There was a lot of shame, because you were being devalued as a human being. In other words, if you were being classified as a 'nigger'... it meant anything could be done to you, because you were not fully human. So it was constant stress. The Anne Frank story... is a story that makes you angry. It makes you mad. It makes you wonder about humanity. However, we've been in situations like that, we've lived like that. So in a way we have lived Anne Frank's life. 'I see the world being slowly transformed into a wasteland. I hear the approaching thunder that one day will destroy us too. I feel the suffering of millions. Yet when I look at the sky, I think everything will change for the better. That this cruelty too will end and peace and tranquility return.' 'I've asked myself again and again whether it wouldn't have been better... if we hadn't gone into hiding. If we'd been dead now... we wouldn't have to go through this misery... and above all, others would have been spared the burden. But we all shrink from this thought. We still love life and haven't yet forgotten the voice of nature... and we still have hope, hope for everything.' The emotion for me is, not being Jewish, wondering what I would have done. Would I have protected them? Would I have risked everything? That's my emotion, questioning myself. And questioning what I'd do today to help people. I would hope I'd do the right thing. Your heart's never gonna dance after going through this. I'm challenged because it speaks to the amount of work that has to be done. Because we see those kinds of ideas in the United States. Those ideas of religious hostility, racial inferiority. It's just a challenge to us that we have to nip those ideas in the bud... before they begin to flower and prosper. Because we don't like to think that this could ever happen again. But it could happen again. 'Father, mother and Margot still can't get used... to the chiming of the Westertoren bell tower... which tells us the time every quarter of an hour. But I liked it from the start. It sounds so reassuring, especially at night.' 'The Annex was delighted to hear that for Christmas... we'll all receive an extra quarter pound of butter. Each of us will bake something with the butter. This morning I baked two cakes and a batch of cookies. It's very busy upstairs and mother told me not to do any studying or reading... until all the household chores have been done.' 'Friday evening, for the first time in my life, I received a Christmas present. There was a jar of yogurt for the children... and a bottle of beer for each of the grownups. Everything was wrapped so nicely, with pretty pictures glued to the parcels. For the rest, the holidays passed by quickly for us.' I've lived through many ordeals. There was nothing to eat... when the Japanese invaded Hong Kong during the Second World War. I lived in Hong Kong at that time. Many people died there. My mother saw there was no food and people were dying of starvation. She got scared and took my brother and me along to the mainland of China. There was nothing there either, so we begged. I was a beggar girl... and I was only seven years old. The Japanese were fond of children. They would give you some rice to eat and some biscuits. I almost died. There was no food. It was really terrible. Women were raped to the point of death. Women were very scared of the Japanese. They'd grab the women and rape them. Then they'd beat them to death. That's why my mother wore a wig. She'd cut off her braid and wore a wig... because if they saw pretty women... they would grab and rape them. The Japanese sent my father to Hainan Island. There he had to dig mines. He didn't have anything to eat... and he got kicked and beaten. Then they decapitated my father. It was terrible. 'I feel bad, because while I sleep in a warm bed... who knows where my best friends have ended up. I get frightened when I think of all the people I've always felt close to... who are now at the mercy of the cruellest brutes that ever lived. And just because they're Jewish.' 'Terrible things happen outside. Day and night, poor people are dragged from their homes. They can only bring a knapsack and a little cash. And these too are taken from them along the way. The families are torn apart as men, women and children are separated.' 'The children here run around in thin shirts and wooden shoes. No coats, no caps, no stockings and no one to help them. Gnawing on a carrot to still their hunger pangs. Things have gotten so bad in Holland... that scores of children stop passers by in the streets... to beg for a piece of bread.' It hurts my heart that such a young girl had to die. So young, so cruel. Murdered by the Germans. What Germany did was really very cruel. It brings tears to my eyes. It's sad, really very sad. All three of us are quite odd, quite strange. As a family we all dress quite eccentrically. And there's a definite sense that that almost deliberately isolates you. So it'd be nice for Molly, at this age, to understand... what other young girls have been through in that sense... so she doesn't feel that she's on her own... if she wants to continue to dress as fabulously as she does now. It's a story about a family and how they try to survive. The idea of losing my daughter in the same way Otto Frank lost his daughter... It's very difficult to articulate into words how you'd feel. As a father you do worry about that as you look at your child growing up. You want her to be safe. You're aware you can't always control that and keep things from happening. That is a very difficult emotion to cope with as a father. It's a little bit too hard a thing to go to if you don't have to. It's very difficult, trying to find a parallel... between my life as a stepmother to Molly... and Anne Frank's mother having to say goodbye to her in the camp... knowing what that meant. All I can do is try and create a fictional situation in my head... where that might ever, ever be. All I can imagine is that if Molly were in hospital and she were dying... and I knew I had a chance to say goodbye to her, it would... It makes me feel sick just to think about it. I don't know how you say goodbye to someone. I don't think you can. It makes me feel physically sick to think about how that would feel. No one in my family died in the war... but as a German I think it's my duty to come here. Also to feel shame for our own past. It makes me feel ashamed because it's our own past. We learn about it at school, but seeing the museum... and reading what it was like really brings that feeling about. I just feel sad for her, because she had such a tough life, hiding away. She could never really go out and play like other kids... because she would be killed and so would her family. Molly suggested we try and creep up the stairs to try and make no noise. To see what it would be like. And it was so hard. We couldn't. We tried really hard to make no noise. And the idea of spending years of your life as a young girl... trying every single day to be invisible... Especially knowing a young girl who's so full of life... and loves to dance and sing and jump around. Yeah, it was horrid. One of the things you notice as you're walking around... is that in one of the rooms there are marks on the wall... where they kept a record of their height growth... over the two years they were in the Annex. So many families do that. It makes you realise the sameness of us all, as well as our differences. That's quite a powerful moment. 'The sun is shining, the sky is a deep blue, there's a lovely breeze... and I have such a deep longing, for everything. I long to talk, I long for freedom, I long for friends... I long to be alone and I do so long to cry. I believe it's spring inside me. I feel that spring is awakening.' After over two years, Anne Frank and those in hiding with her were betrayed. They were arrested by a group of German police on August 4, 1944... and transported to a concentration camp. It isn't known who betrayed Anne Frank and the others. Only Anne's father, Otto Frank, survived the war. He published Anne's diary. I was in concentration camp Bergen-Belsen. I already was in Bergen-Belsen when Anne Frank arrived there. I don't know where she worked. Anne Frank was younger than me. But I must have met her, not knowing that she'd become so famous later on. The worst thing about Bergen-Belsen was the fear... the dehumanization, that you were a number... that they could do with you as they pleased, they could kill you. You were not a human being, you were less than an animal. If you had to use the toilet, you had to sit on planks with holes in them... men and women side by side. You didn't have anything a normal person needs. You weren't only hungry, you had lice, you had head lice. You were covered with lice. You were dirty, filthy. That was the worst thing about the camp. That you were less than the lowest insect, that they could trample you. We had to get up at three in the morning. We had to shower. At that moment I thought: 'We're going to be gassed'. We went to the showers and had to strip naked. We entered the shower, and there were showerheads on the ceiling. We all thought gas would come out. We were all terrified. We didn't know there were no gas chambers there. That was one of the most terrifying experiences I had. Anne Frank fell ill, as did her sister Margot. In Bergen-Belsen that meant you were taken to the sick barracks. Because they were both very ill. So Anne and Margot died of illness in the sick barracks of Bergen-Belsen. No one who went there came out alive. I've never heard of anyone who survived. So that I came out alive and Anne didn't... is only due to the fact that Anne fell ill, probably after an infection, and I didn't. A few months longer and I might not have survived either. You had to be strong, young and very lucky. 'This is the day. The invasion has begun. A huge commotion in the Annex. Is this really the beginning of the long-awaited liberation? The liberation we've all talked so much about... which still seems too good, too much of a fairy tale to ever come true? Will this year, 1944, bring us victory? The prospect of going back to school in October... is making me too happy to be logical.' It reminded me from A to Z and from beginning to end of my own life... in Bergen-Belsen. That's something you cannot escape. She's so full of hope while she is in hiding. But we know how her life in Bergen-Belsen... ended in a terrible way. When I see the lines of people who want to know more about Anne Frank's life... I realise how important Anne's story is. 'I want to go on living even after my death! I can shake off everything if I write. My sorrows disappear, my courage is reborn. But, and that is the big question, will I ever be able to write anything great? Will I ever become a journalist or a writer?'
