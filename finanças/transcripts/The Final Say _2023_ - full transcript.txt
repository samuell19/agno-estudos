Thank you. You're welcome. Glad you made it. Barely. I've been flying all day trying to get to Atlanta. It's been a mess. Thankfully, I got an available seat on this flight. I guess it was meant to be. And this seat was meant for you. Amen to that. I'm Latrice. Nice to meet you, Latrice. I'm Jordan. This weather is horrible. Ah, don't get me wrong. I'm happy I made it on here, but I hate flying in bad weather. It makes me nervous. Don't worry, you'll be all right. You just have to have faith and, you know, wait it out. Welcome aboard to Flight 720 nonstop to Atlanta. My name is Brittany and I'm your in-flight service director. The cabin crew is here to make sure you have an enjoyable flight. In the event of a decompression, an oxygen mask will automatically appear in front of you. To start the flow of oxygen, pull the mask towards you, like this. I've heard the safety mask demo so many times, I could almost recite it by heart. Same here. Thank goodness we haven't needed to put it to good use. Or use our seat cushion as a flotation device. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Due to weather conditions we are currently in a holding pattern until the storm passes over the East Coast, we will not be deplaning and we're in line behind other flights. I'll keep you posted when we've been cleared for takeoff. This is not what I need to hear right now. I need to get to Atlanta tonight. My sister's wedding's this weekend. I'm the maid of honor. Bad enough I already missed the bachelorette party and the bridal shower. If I miss this wedding, she will disown me. I'm headed to Atlanta for a wedding myself. I'm actually performing a ceremony for two very important people in my life. See, you need to get there just as bad as I do. Yeah, we'll get to Atlanta right on time. We just have to weather the storm and wait it out. That simple, huh? Pretty much. We'll get there when we're supposed to. You did hear the pilot say that we have to wait a while, right? How are you so certain? You know, God's timing is perfect. Things may be delayed, but not denied. What do you mean? Let me tell you a story about perfect timing. There was this couple, Valerie and Vaughn, who met on a blind date. Lindsey, Valerie's best friend, set them up. Now she knew deep down that they would hit it off perfectly. What Lindsey? I'm already nervous enough. I don't need you stressing me out about this. Oh, how did you even know it was me? Because I know you. That's how. And I know you too. That's why I know this, girl: This about to be the best date ever. Okay, didn't I just tell you I don't need any stress? First of all, you need to breathe. Second, I'm not trying to stress you out. I'm just making sure you're good. Girl, there is no reason to be nervous. Vaughn is an amazing guy. He's down to Earth, he's patient, got a great sense of humor, and he loves God. Yeah, well, I would feel better about it if I could have seen him or at least talk to him before tonight. I mean, he might not even be my type. Girl, it's a blind date, Val. Trust me, you're gonna love him. I can feel it. Now just relax and enjoy yourself and do not be late. Seven o'clock sharp. Okay? I won't. But also, how am I gonna know it's him? You'll know. Now go, have fun. And you can thank me at your wedding 'cause you know I'm gonna be your maid of honor. Yeah. Okay. Well, I gotta finish getting ready. Bye. Alright, now call me after your date. Love you. Yes. Love you too. Bye. Wow, a blind date. Did it work out? From what I hear it did. - Vaughn? - Hey, hey. You must be Valerie? - Yeah. Hi. - Hey. Here I thought I was beating you here. Well, it looks like we both have perfect timing. - Yeah. - That's for you. - Thank you. - So shall we? - Yeah. - Yeah. Lemme get your coat. Thank you. That perfect timing led to a perfect wedding. Damn, Baby. You know it. What do you say? Yes? Yeah? Oh my god. This is such a big house. Four bedrooms! Vaughn, what are we gonna do with all this space? Aw, fill it up with a lotta kids. You know, I want at least five of 'em. - Oh? - Mm-hmm. This house is gonna be filled with so much love and laughter that we just might have to get an even bigger one. - Taylor five, huh? - Taylor five, Boo. - That's a lot of kids, Baby. - I know, Baby. I think we should go ahead and get started then, right? You know, I was thinking- - Uh huh. - What about the Taylor 10? As much as their happiness grew, life threw them a curve ball as it sometimes does. Thanks for coming by, Lindsey. I really appreciate it. You don't have to thank me Vaughn, we're family. You know, I hate that you guys are going through this. Yeah, me too. We gonna get through it though. - Vaughn, Baby. - Yes, Baby. - Can I have some tea? - Yeah. Sure. Hey sis. I'm sorry. You gonna be okay though. You know that, right? I just don't know what happened. I did everything I was supposed to do. A miscarriage, Lindsey? Why? It's not your fault, Valerie. These things, they just, they happen. But no matter what, you can't give up on your dream of becoming a mother. I promise it's gonna happen for you. - Here you go, Baby. - Thank you. Careful, it's hot. I'm so sorry. I know you really wanted this and I was praying for a healthy baby- No, sweetheart, you didn't do anything wrong. But we've been waiting so long. Why is it taking so long? Hey, you know what, we'll wait for however long it takes. Okay? I got you Baby. And God got us. - I love you. - I love you too. I love you too. I know. Five years and they still didn't get what they prayed for? I would've given up. Well, imagine if you would've given up getting on the next available flight. You wouldn't be sitting here right now. Yes, you're right. I made it on the flight. But am I gonna make it to the wedding? This rain is so bad. Look at this weather. I don't know. I do. Even the worst of storms blow over. They don't last forever. You have to wait them out. Have faith. Faith? Is that why Valerie and Vaughn didn't give up? Yes. They held on to their faith. You remember this song? How could I ever forget? It's the night you proposed. Yeah, I sure did. And I love you just as much now as I did back then. What about you? - Mm. - Mm? Hey you. I think I love you even more now. You better. Your sexy self. Whoo girl. Hey, let's eat. Hmm. You know, I was just thinking, can you believe it's been, it's been 10 years. I mean, of course. Because I'm just so easy to love. Is that why we lasted this long, huh? I mean, you can do make a mean lasagna and you are still quite handsome. Oh, yes I am. Baby, I've been thinking about our anniversary party this weekend. Do you think we have enough space for everyone? Yeah. Yeah. Why you think we got this big old house? So we can have celebrations for everyone to come and enjoy themselves. I thought it was to fill it with kids. That too. And we will. But tomorrow it'll be filled with family and friends first. Okay? Hey. What up? What up, what up? What's up fellas? What's going on? Yo, Mr. Vaughn, can we go around, toss around today? We've been practice like you showed us the other day. Oh man, fellas. Miss Val and I are in the middle of cooking dinner. - Hi guys. - Hey, Ms. Valerie. So I'm, I'm sorry. Can we toss around another time? Is that cool? How about I finish cooking dinner and you can go coach the boys and then maybe you guys can join us for dinner. Thank you, Miss Valerie. - You're welcome. - Alright, look. Go out there. I'll meet y'all outside. I gotta get my jacket. Okay? - Alright. - Cool. Better get ready. I will. Alright. Thank you Baby. You see, this is really good practice for when you have to cook for our boys. You just want an excuse to not cook dinner. - Facts. - Mm-hmm. - Love you. - Mm. I love you. Alright, let's see what you boys got. Let's see what you got, fellas. Oh boy. Baby? Oh yeah. Babe, where are you? Food looks good. Hey. Hey babe. What... Baby is it? It's positive. Oh Baby, I told you, I told you God had a plan for us. You did, but Baby, put me down. I'm gonna be sick. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You okay? You need anything? Do you need to sit down? I'm fine. I'm fine. I can get you something. You okay? I'm fine. Oh, you know how amazing the time of this is? I mean the family's gonna lose it. Oh wait. No, no, no, no, no, Baby, Baby, we cannot tell them right now. We have to go to the doctor and make sure everything is okay. Okay? What? No, no, no, Baby. Wait, what? Why? No! We, everybody's been praying for this. They deserve to know that God blessed us with this baby. Vaughn, and we'll tell them. We will tell them when the time is right. But not now. Baby, Baby, promise me. I promise. I promise. Okay. First of the Taylor five, Baby. - Hey. - Hey! - Look at you! - Mwah. - Hey! What's up? - Hey bro. What's going on? Hey, sis. - What's up brother? - Nothing. Chilling. Hey you. Hey! I'm gonna leave y'all to it. Mwah. Alright. Okay. What's going on fellas? Let it go, let it go. Look at you. You're still the trouble, man. What you up to, man? What's happening? What's happening? Well, you know, I don't, I don't know about, you Pastor Terry, but I can't wait for this young man to give us some grandsons. - Mm-hmm. - I feel the same way, brother. Oh, you know what you always say, Pastor Terry. Oh, yeah? What's that? It's God's timing. Absolutely. His timing is divine. Even if it's not mine. Oh Pastor. So true, so true, so true. Look at them over there. I give you one guess what they over there talking about? You know, I already know. Grandkids. Baby, you okay? We didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable. We're just trying to be supportive. No, I know. And I appreciate that, Mama. It's, we've been trying, you know, it's just been a little difficult. Oh, honey. Difficult doesn't equal impossible. We're still praying for you two. I know. - It's gonna happen, honey. - Yes. - You just need to be patient. - Yes. Patience. Thank you. And look, we will take all of the prayers we can handle. - Always. - Thank you. Love you. Love you too. Excuse me while I go check in on these troublemakers. Okay. Excuse me? Hey Sis, how you feeling? Hopeful and in love. Oh, definitely in love. And that will be your fault, Lindsey, since you hooked them up. You welcome. Talking about hooking up. what's going on with this guy you've been talking to? What's his name? Brandon. Braden. It's nothing serious. We just chilling right now. Which works for me because I only have one more semester until I complete grad school. I know that's right. Look, don't be distracted by anyone or anything, no matter how cute. 'Cause trust and believe, if you do, you'll end up graduating a year later. You don't want that. Look. She is right. You are so close to the finish line, Sis. Don't mess up. - Oh, the pressure. - Yes, the pressure is real. I know you know the pressure is real. For you too. But that's okay 'cause I'mma witness that you guys will be great parents. - Aw. - You guys definitely helped to raise me. Aw, my little practice baby all grown up. Excuse me. Excuse me. If I could get everybody's attention, please. Can I get my beautiful daughter and my son-in-law up here, please. As well as my lovely wife. For the past 10 years, we have been blessed to witness the two of you share life and love. You have truly exemplified what Christ has to say about marriage. - Yes. - Amen. You know that me and your mother are very proud of you. - Yes. - Thank you, Daddy. We know your dedication to yourselves, your families, the church and your community can sometimes be tiring. So we decided you both could use a little R and R. And I know I could use a little break from them at church. And with that, to celebrate your anniversary, we are sending you two on an all expense paid cruise to Detroit. - Oh honey! - I'm playing. You are going to Jamaica. What? Come on, man. Pops. Thank you, man. This is, this is such a blessing. And listen, I know I speak for Valerie and me when I say that... we're just really grateful, you know, and not just for the last 10 years, but for all of you guys. You guys are awesome. And it's been, it's been an incredible ride. We are very, very grateful for this cruise because we could definitely use a vacation. That's right. Especially since this might be the last vacation we get to take for a while. We're having a baby, y'all. A what? - A what? - Alright! - A new baby? - Oh my God! Well hello, Grandma. And Grandpa. Yes sir, yes sir. Ain't that good? It was a great party, wasn't it? Everybody had a good time. You know, they ate all the meatballs though. Man, I was hoping some would be left for leftovers for a midnight snack or something. You know what? I bet you Charysse, I bet you her greedy butt took a plate home. At least there are a couple, couple wings left I guess. Val, are you gonna talk to me? You promised you wouldn't say anything about the pregnancy. I know, Babe. I, I wasn't even planning on saying anything. You know, I just got, got kind of caught up in the moment. Right before your dad pulled me up and talked. He and Pastor T were going on and on about how exciting it would be to be grandparents. And I just- Look, you, you think I don't know that. I just wanted to announce it when we were ready. I know, Baby. I know. But come on, Val. It was, I thought it was the perfect moment to share the good news with the family, that's all. Vaughn, what if it's not good news? I'm scared. No, nuh-uh, no, Baby. No, no. You don't have to be. Okay, you don't have to be scared. Nothing's gonna go wrong. How do you know that? I mean, what do you Yeah. No, Valerie Baby, there's no what if, okay? Hey, this is the, this is the blessing we've been praying for, right? Hey, look at me. Look at me. Don't let fear rob you of a place that faith brought us to. Okay? Okay? I know. Okay, come here. Valerie, Vaughn, it's good to see you both. Good to see you too, Dr. Dennison. So I got the blood test results back from this morning, and unfortunately it was a false positive. But that doesn't make any sense. I know it's hard to hear, but sometimes they can be false positive, especially in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome like yourself. So you're saying I'm not pregnant? I'm sorry, Valerie. But the blood test confirms it. She can still get pregnant though, right? Look, I know it's been a difficult journey for the both of you, but with a diagnosis of PCOS, history of miscarriages, advancing age, it's gonna be extremely challenging. But not impossible. Well, the last time we ran tests the equality was poor. I mean, we can retest if you'd like. No. I understand. I'm sorry to give you the bad news, but there are other options you can consider like egg donation, surrogacy, adoption. Okay. Thanks Dr. Dennison. In the meantime, I'll send over something for the nausea. You can pick it up at the pharmacy. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hey. - Hey. Can I get you anything? Make you some tea? No, I'm fine. I don't need anything. Okay. But Baby, you should at least eat something. Vaughn, why didn't you listen to me when I asked you not to mention anything about the baby? Now I have to deal with this all over again. No, no. Val, you don't. You don't. We're gonna deal with this together, Baby. - I'm going upstairs. - Baby, Baby. Baby, hey, Valerie. Val, hey, wait, let's talk about this. Talk about what? The doctor already said. It's near damn impossible for me to carry a baby. So I need to process this new. Okay. Wait. You can, Valerie! On my own. Man, come on. We can talk about this. We can work this out together. You don't have to walk away. Baby. Charysse. What, what's going on? What's wrong? What's wrong? Vaughn, I messed up big time. You messed up. Messed up how? What? What's, what happened? I'm pregnant. Are, you're what? Are you sure? Yes. I just left the doctor's office. God. Vaughn, I can't have a baby right now. I'm supposed to finish grad school and then move to Texas. Damn! I have to wait and then move to Texas. Vaughn, why is this happening to me? Okay, okay, okay. Alright. I'm sorry. Look, look... What am I gonna tell Daddy, Tia and Mama Becca? - Don't don't. - They're gonna be so disappointed. I know. I know. Hey Sis. Look, look at me. Look. Hey, hey, hey. Relax. Calm. It's, it's gonna be okay. Just...what? It's all right. Val, what am I gonna do? Come on. It's gonna be okay. Val, sweetie, I brought you something to eat. Okay? Good morning. Morning. You're not dressed. Nope. I'm not going to church today. Val, come on. Baby, you've been cooped up in this house for the past week. What's your point? My point is, my point is, I think that being around people who love you will make you feel better. Yeah, well, I don't feel like the pity looks and somber faces. And I'm tired of the I'm so sorry texts, emails, empty prayers. You can't blame them for being concerned and showing their support, Baby. I don't wanna make you late for church today.

Life is gonna knock us down. Oh yes. But when we feel discouraged, when we are facing defeat, that's when our faith can be strengthened the most. Yes. Say it, Pastor. When circumstances make us want to throw in the towel and give up. Yes. That's when we have to stand strong on God's Word. Life is not fair. - Amen. - You're right about it.

Really? 'Cause you don't look fine. I mean, it's not like you've been answering any of our phone calls. You know I'm sorry I'm not in the mood for much conversation. I don't really have anything to say. Well I do. I wanna apologize to you. What I said to Vaughn that day when I told him my news was selfish and disrespectful and I should have known better. I love you and the last thing I'd ever want to do is hurt you. I know that. Charysse, I do. I think I owe you an apology too. I should have been there for you when you needed me, but I couldn't. And I still don't know if I can. I'm, I'm just- You're just processing your own grief, sweetie. And there is nothing wrong with that. You just need time to deal with this loss. And Charysse, you need to understand and respect that. I do. Good, 'cause you're both going through a lot right now. But the thing you have to remember is that even though it feels like you're alone, you're not. God is still right there in the middle just hugging you and holding you and loving you. And so am I. I love you. I love you. - I love you too. - We do love you. Yes, you're gonna get this love. You run girl. - No. - We're coming in. Get all of this love, all of this love. I love you. - I love you too. - I love you. How's Val doing? She's angry. I wish she would've been here to hear the sermon. I mean, life just knocked her down. And I keep trying to fix things, but it seems like I just make 'em worse. Sweetie, some things you are not going to be able to fix. That's God's job, Vaughn, not yours. Listen, Son, imagine you, Val, Mama Becca and I, we're all riding in a car. Who's gonna be in control? Whoever's driving. Exactly. We're just the passengers. God is in control. And what we have to do is trust that he knows where he's taking us and how we're going to get there. And one thing God doesn't need is a backseat driver. What you're going to have to do is experience the ride the whole way through. Take your hands off the steering wheel, Baby and let him drive. Come on. Let's all pray. Heavenly Father. God, I'm lost. And I need your help. And I know that faith without works is dead. So I need you to show me the way. 'Cause I love Vaughn. I love Vaughn. And my heart is hurting. God I, I need you to make it okay. ♪ Son of man, where are you going? ♪ ♪ Can you slow down, 'cause I need just a bit of your time ♪ Thank you. Thank you. Valerie and Charysse remind me of me and my sister. She couldn't understand why I wanted to move to Virginia after I graduated from college instead of coming back home to be near the family. She thought that I was being selfish. Really? Our father was undergoing chemo. She told me that I'd be hurting the family. What she didn't realize was that my father was the one who encouraged me to pursue my dreams. Sounds like a great man. He was the absolute best. It took my sister a long time to realize that he was right. It wasn't until finding her now fiancee and enjoying her own life that she finally understood why I wanted to live mine. You know, God always has a way of working things out. Yeah, I guess you're right. How did things work out for Valerie and Vaughn? Valerie prayed a lot, but eventually got herself together. She even made her way back to church. Everything seemed to be back on track for the couple. ♪ God's got joy ♪ God's got joy ♪ God's got joy ♪ God's got joy ♪ God's got joy ♪ God's got joy ♪ God's got joy ♪ God's got joy ♪ God's got joy ♪ God's got joy ♪ God's got joy ♪ God's got joy ♪ God's got joy ♪ God's got joy ♪ God's got joy ♪ God's got joy ♪ God's got joy ♪ God's got joy ♪ God's got joy ♪ God's got joy ♪ Yes he has ♪ Yes he has ♪ Yes he has ♪ Oh yes he does Thank you!

I just want you to know I'm here as a resource if you want to talk, vent, cry. And again, talk... Val? Yes, yes, yes. Are you alright? Yes. Actually, I think I just got the answer I needed. That husband of yours is something else. He's really a big kid at heart. He is, isn't he? I'll go get the rest of the bags. What's with all the junk food? Oh, Chris and Elijah are gonna come over and play some video games. So I got some junk food for the occasion. You know, nothing goes better with a day of video games than cookies and ice cream. Right, so when did you decide you were hanging out with the boys? Uh, do you have a problem with 'em coming over? I didn't think it was a big deal, Baby. Yeah, of course not. Because nothing's ever a big deal with you. Is it Vaughn? Okay then why is this even an issue? Because you have a habit of doing things without even considering me first. Valerie, come on. That's not true. Hey. Yo, Mr. Vaughn, I brought my controller. Me too. Uh, look guys, I'm gonna have to take a rain check on game night. What Mr. Vaughn, you promised if we got all As and Bs we could celebrate. I, I know, I know, I know. And I, I'm sorry. I'm really proud of you both and we'll celebrate soon. Just right now is not a good time. - Hey. - Hi. Hi, Ms. Valerie. Mr. Vaughn got you guys a lotta treats. So go ahead and go in. - Thank you. - Thank you. Baby, you sure? I'm positive. Okay. Where you going? Valerie? Val. What the hell? Hell. You know how many times I've called you? Where have you been? Sorry, Vaughn. But I needed space. I needed to think. Breathe. It's one o'clock in the morning, so you have to gimme something more than space. I had a lot on my mind, so I had to go somewhere and clear it. Is that okay? Because it's been punch in the gut after another for me. And I'm tired, so I needed a breather from everything. Oh, okay. So did you get the clarity that you needed? - Actually, I did. - Oh, okay. What is that? I want a divorce. What are you doing? Valerie? Baby, look, I know we're going through a difficult time right now, but this is ridiculous. Will you talk to me please? Valerie. Babe. You know what, Valerie? There's no reason whatsoever. There's no reason for you to even say that word to me or for you to be doing any of this. You know why? Because it's not happening. 'Cause I'm not letting it happen. You know what? Okay, I'll tell you what, do this all day long. You're gonna talk to me eventually. Vaughn, please don't do this. Don't do what? Hmm? Don't do what? Valerie, what, stop you from acting crazy right now? Because that's exactly what you're doing. This is crazy. I'm not crazy. Well it looks that way to me! Vaughn, I'm leaving and there's nothing you can do about. Look, Baby, look. I'm sorry. Look. Hey, hey. You are my wife, okay? And I love you more than anything or anyone. Don't you know that? Vaughn. I love you more than you know, but I can't stay with you knowing that I can't make you happy. What are you talking about? Where, where you get that from, Babe? I'm, I'm sorry Baby. Look, look at me. I'm, I'm happy. Okay? Stop. - I'm happy, Val. - Stop. Stop, stop. I can't be married to you. I can never give you a child. Look, child or not. You're my life, Baby. You're my world. And I'm not letting you go. You hear me? I'm, I'm not letting you leave. You don't have a choice. I have a choice. Yes, I have a choice, Baby. I have a choice. Vaughn, you don't have a choice. Valerie. Baby! Baby! ♪ You couldn't have ♪ I'd strip myself bare for you ♪ ♪ Just to keep you next to me ♪ Oh and that's how I fell for you ♪ ♪ Regardless of all those times you made a fool out of me ♪ ♪ You knew it wouldn't be easy ♪ For you to walk away from me, yeah ♪ ♪ When I see you, when I see you ♪ Everything looks so good, Ma. You made all of Dad's faves. Yes I did. You little thief. You know better. You're right. You're right. But hopefully he comes down soon. 'Cause I'm hungry, Mom. He will. He will, Baby. But you still haven't told me where Vaughn is. Oh, Lindsey's here. Hey girl, you look cute. Um, don't "Hey girl" me. You have been ignoring my texts and calls all week. What's going on with you? I'll talk to you about it later. Lindsey Baby, you made it. Oh, hey auntie. Now you know I wouldn't miss this birthday boy celebration for nothing. Look it. Oo you look cute! Well dinner's served. Oh, great, because I'm starving. Hey. Happy birthday, Uncle E. Happy birthday, Daddy. Thank you both. That's my beautiful girls. Oo, y'all think this is enough food? My darling husband requested all of this and I obliged. Yes, your aunt knows all too well how to make me happy. And you do the same for me, honey. Mwah. Don't worry, she's just being nice 'cause it's my birthday. Tomorrow she'll be back to bossing me around. Exactly. So you better enjoy this while you can. Look, I don't know about y'all, but I'm ready to eat. Val, where is Vaughn? Uh, he's not coming. Uh, why? He, he's never missed a family celebration before. I asked him not to. Now why would you do that? We're just not seeing eye to eye on some things right now. And I thought it would be best if he wasn't here. Wha, what are you you talking about? Look, I think that we should eat first. And I can explain that later. We don't want the food to get cold. Uh no, no, no, no, no. No Baby girl, this, this food can wait. You, you need to tell us what's going on with you and Vaughn. I asked for a divorce. - What? - A divorce? - A divorce? - Why? Val, you, you love Vaughn. Yes, I do, with all of my heart. Which is why I need to let him go. Valerie, this is, this isn't making any sense. Look, Vaughn deserves to be with someone who can give him everything he needs. That's not me, Daddy. Look that, that's ridiculous, Val. Vaughn practically worships the ground that you walk on. Heck, he, he thanks God for you every day. You don't wanna do this. Lindsey's right, Val, Vaughn is a man of God and a great husband. And Valeria, you are a great wife. Hell, you're a great couple. Daddy, how can I be a great wife and I can't give him any kids? And I know that's what he wants most in this life. Don't say that. It's true, Lindsey. How many years have we tried? How many? And still I continue to disappoint him. I can't keep living with that. Baby, you don't have to get a divorce. You two can go to counseling and get help. Your dad and I are here if you need us. - Yes. - You know that. Whatever you and Vaughn need, we got you. Daddy, what I need from all of you is just to support my decision. My mind is made up and I'm not gonna change it. Happy birthday, Daddy. Val. Yeah, I, I need a drink. - What? - Need not right now. - Of, of water, Pastor. - Hold on. I'm sorry, but your daughter is trippin'. Camera, it's my birthday. Please. I'm sorry. Just you can have the big piece of chicken 'cause I just can't at this point. Thanks for coming, Val. Of course. Look, I know you love us and I appreciate your concern, but this conversation is pointless. You seem certain about this, Valerie. Why is that? Because I know that I'm doing the right thing for both of us. No, no, no, no. This is not for the both of us. This is for you. Vaughn, I've prayed about this more than you know, and I've realized that you will end up resenting me because I can't bear you children and I can't live with that. Vaughn, I have never wanted you to feel trapped. Trapped is a very strong word, Val. Vaughn loves you unconditionally. You think you're the only woman that has gone through this? You're not. Sarah went through it for years, not able to give Abraham a child. But God fulfilled his promise and blessed them with Isaac. He did the same thing for Pastor T and I. Yes, he did. We went more than a decade without having a child of our own. Yes. Then we were blessed to be able to step in and and raise Vaughn and Charysse. Yes. And I'm like a father to him. Rebecca loves them as much as if she had given birth to them herself. And Vaughn loves you as much as I love my wife. And for the past 10 years, Vaughn has been the most incredible husband. Yes. But now I want you to enjoy the rest of your life with someone who can fulfill all of your needs. You Baby, you already do that. No, I don't. You are both spiritually grounded individuals. And you have always said that you are the answer to each other's prayer. And see, I still believe that. I, I do. I still believe that. But clearly she doesn't. You have to trust the journey God has you on, Val. Even if right now you don't understand it. Pastor Terry, the hardest thing that I have had to accept: motherhood isn't part of my journey. But that doesn't mean that fatherhood isn't part of Vaughn's. No. Let's join hands and pray. Prayer is what got me to this decision! My new prayer is that Vaughn and everybody else accept that decision. Valerie, God doesn't make mistakes. You gotta trust that he knows what he's doing. You once told me that love is about sacrifice, right? Yes. Then I'm gonna do everything that I can to make sure Vaughn can experience all the happiness he desires. Valerie. Yeah. You see, they switched. They switched. They switched the things around. They ain't switched nothing. - They did switch it. - They ain't switched nothing. Dude, this is not jumping. It's supposed to jump. No it's just you, it's the user. It's the batteries. I gotta tell you though, bro, I know you and Val have had your challenges, but y'all always come out on the other side and you're happy. Yeah. Well, I love Val so much and I don't want our marriage to end, but... I don't know what to do. Look, sometimes you just gotta let people go and just pray that they come to their senses. Oh my! No! You're a cheater. - It's the batteries! - No, you suck! I told you. - Vaughn. - Listen, I have something to say. Ju, just please just hear me out and I'll leave. Fine. Come in. Listen, I've thought about it and I've prayed about it, and um, I'm willing to give you the divorce. Look, I know it's hard, and this- On one condition. I want us to go on this cruise. Okay, look, it's non-refundable, nontransferable. We owe it to your parents and to ourselves. But just go and talk to some- Vaughn I don't think- Val, I'm asking for this one thing from you. I just want one last good memory together. - Okay. - Okay, good. Then it's settled. We'll go on the cruise and you can have your divorce. What'd I miss? I don't understand why we have to continue to sit here and wait. Why not just let us de plane? Maybe because the pilot has faith that we're going to take off anytime now. I guess. Trust me. You are not gonna miss your sister's wedding. Are you always this positive? Pretty much. You never get worked up or worried about anything? Well, of course I do, but I try to understand that when things are outta my control, I just go with it, because I know who's in charge. Oh yeah, I know that too. But um- And you know, did you know that God's voice thunders in marvelous ways. He does great things beyond our understanding. And he says to the snow, fall on the Earth and says to the rain shower, be a mighty downpour so that everyone he has made knows his works and he brings in the clouds to water his Earth and show his love. Wow. I never thought about a storm that way. Yeah. My father always says, God always has a purpose and plan for everything, including storms. Your father seems like a wise man. Very much so. He's my inspiration. So speaking of plans, did Vaughn's plans save his marriage? Not entirely. So how do you feel about having Pastor Ron speak at the conference? Oh, absolutely. He's amazing. Yeah. I'll give him a call. Come in. Knock, knock. Hey! He's back. Bearing gifts. Hey. Oh welcome home, Son. Thank you. This is for you. - Oh! - That's for you. Alrighty. Thank you. So, how was the cruise? Uh, the cruise was nice. You, you and Val, you enjoy yourselves? Well, we tried. You know, we spent most of our time arguing, being frustrated with one another. We spent more time apart than we did together, so... Oh, Vaughn, I'm so sorry, sweetheart. So no resolve? Nope. We're moving forward with the divorce. No. Yeah. My marriage is over. I've learned to accept it and nothing's gonna bring us back other than a miracle, so... Miracles happen every day, Vaughn. She's right. Don't you give up on your marriage. Now, even though right now you and Val are moving in different directions, God is still in the driver's seat. ♪ TV, loveseat, refrigerator, sofa ♪ ♪ Space game going, whole family's over ♪ ♪ Cool in the summertime ♪ Heat when it's colder in this house ♪ ♪ My mama, Jesus and Martin Luther ♪ ♪ Hanging on the wall, let me introduce ya ♪ ♪ I was gonna build my family's future in this house ♪ But sometimes your best ♪ Just ain't enough Wait, wait, wait. So Vaughn is really dating again? Yes. And it is the nurse who helped deliver Charysse's baby. Wow. Now that's, that's crazy. How do you, how do you feel about that? About what? About your husband moving on? I made my peace with it. Well you know, I'm gonna be honest. I was hoping that cruise would get you two back together again. Yeah. Well, we barely spoke. He went his way and I went mine. Well, now the divorce is final and he's moved on. Shh, you can move on too. Girl, I still haven't gotten those final divorce papers. They were supposed to be mailed out months ago. Maybe it's a sign. A sign? No, no. Why are we sitting up here talking about my ex-husband anyway? Tonight is a night of celebration and friendship and new beginnings. - Okay. - Yeah, speaking of which, um, I think I'm gonna get some work done. Get some new boobs, waist reduction. Well alright then. Here's the new boobs and a new bod. - I like it. - Mm-hmm. I like it. I can tell that you and your sister are really close. Have you always been that way? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Pretty much. Yeah, our parents passed away when she was 12. And my godparents, Pastor Terry and Lady Rebecca, they stepped in and they helped me raise her. Oh, amazing. I love that she named the baby after you. What a little cutie. Yeah, he is quite handsome. I mean, I know I could be a little biased, but, you know. So what about you? Any thoughts of having children? Ah, you know, Zoe, once upon a time there was nothing I wanted more in this world than to be a father. But now I, I'm not so sure. Really? Why not? It's a long story. That's fair. How about dessert? Excuse me. This is a lot. Are you sure you wanna go through with this? Yes. Yes, yes, yes. New boobs, new bod, remember? Okay, I'm just asking. You know what they say with them things all sitting up perky, you know? Maybe that's what I need. - Uh, Mrs. Taylor? - I love it. It's Ms. Sorry, Ms. Taylor please follow me. New boobs, new you. Hi, I just wanted to let you know that Ms. Taylor will be out in a few minutes. What? A few minutes. It's only been, it's only been 15 minutes. Is everything okay? Well, unfortunately she will not be having a procedure this morning. Why? What? Well did something happen? She's fine. She can explain when she comes out. Oh, okay. Thank you. Thank you. Valerie. What's going on? What'd you change your mind? Girl, say something. Open your mouth. Say some words. Hey! Come in. Hello brother, how are you? What a surprise. A little big head. Look at you. Looking all good. Hey, wait, where's my nephew? He is with Mama Becca and Daddy T. They like spoiling him and I needed a break, so I came to check on you. Oh, okay. Well, I hear that. Well, I'm just making some food. You want something to eat? Yes. Yes. Okay, cool. Go ahead. Pop a squat. I'll make you a plate. Okay. So, how are things going with Zoe? Are you enjoying dating again? Yeah. Yeah. It's uh, it's been an adjustment. Do you like her? Yeah, she's nice. Hmm. Hmm. No, I just um... I guess I'm just taking things a little slow, you know? I don't wanna, I don't wanna rush anything. I get it. I mean, after being married for so long, of course it's gonna take a while to get back into dating. Yeah. Yeah, yeah it um, Yeah it, it, it does take a minute. You haven't been to church in a while. You're missed. Yeah. Yeah. I, I know. It just feels different without Valerie. You know, I guess it was something we always did together. It was a major part of our marriage and... you know Sis, sometimes I, I don't even know if I'm gonna feel normal again, you know? You will, Vaughn, you're just going through your adjustment period. But things are gonna work out in your favor. You already know that because you're the one who taught me that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, deep down I know that they will, because they always do. But thank you for the reminder. You know, from time to time I tend to forget, so... Alright, bring it in. Aw. It's okay. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Go eat your food. Would you look at that? Mm. Put my foot in it. I taste like it. Grabbed your mail. Thank you. My divorce papers. Of course they came today. And of course they sent me both copies. Mm! Val, you've gotta talk to Vaughn. Girl, it's been over a week. He has a right to know that you're pregnant. Lindsey, this is a mess. This is such a big mess. I literally forced my husband away, made him divorce me because I didn't think I could get pregnant. Now the divorce is finalized? And I'm pregnant. What am I supposed to say to him? Oops, Baby, I, I made a mistake. Listen, listen, you gotta trust. You gotta trust and have unwavering faith in what God is doing. Now is not the time to lean onto your own understanding. - Hey Baby. - Zoe. Hey. - Hey! - Hey, hey. I, I didn't uh. Yeah, I'm um, I'm kinda in the middle of something right now. Okay. I didn't mean to bother you. No, no, no, no, no, no. You, you're not bothering me. It's just I... It's just that I was, you know, I would... Look, we'll talk soon. Okay? Will we? Yes, we will. Hey, hey, yeah, yeah, listen, I need your help. Yeah? Okay. Alright. Thank you. Thank you. Alright. Okay, bye. Vaughn. Uh, don't be mad. I told him where you live. I'm not mad. Thank you, Sis. I'll leave you two to talk. Thank you. I'm sorry for showing up on announced, but I just... Valerie, Val? Hey! It's the divorce decree. Okay. Okay, now look, doesn't matter what a piece of paper says, okay? I'll always love you, so... There's something else. I'm pregnant. You what? Pregnant. I don't, I don't know. I don't, I don't know what, I don't know what to say about that. What do you want me to say about what, what, what is that? I don't. Why are you telling me? I, I didn't plan for any of this to happen. I just, I wasn't sick. I, I, I had no symptoms. I, I, I'm barely even showing. And they told me last week and then the papers- You don't, you don't owe me no explanation about none of that. - Vaughn, you don't- - You know what? You know what's so funny? All this time, all this time, 10 years, the thing that we wanted the most. You know I wanted this. You know I wanted this. The thing we wanted the most. Now you get to have it with somebody else. I swew. You know what? I gotta go. Thank you for these papers and you have a good life. I want you to have a good life with your new man. And y'all new baby. - You're the father. - What? You are the father, Vaughn. Are you freaking kidding me right now? How the hell am I the father? I'm six and a half months pregnant. No, you can't be. Look hey, look you. Oh. Okay, hold on. You know, yeah, yeah. Just need to sit down. Um, could you gimme something to drink please, Valerie? Need something, need something please. This is, so this our baby. This is our baby? What is so funny? God has uh, got one heck of a sense of humor, man. Yeah, he does. Are you serious? Wait, I have so many questions. What about Zoe? Did he break up with her or did they stay together? Wait, did Valerie and Vaughn get back together? Do they actually have the baby? Oh, I gotta know what happened next. Oh, me too. Well, things moved quickly for the couple. By the power vested in me. I now pronounce you husband and wife. What God has joined together let no one set asunder. Y'all can kiss. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm happy to announce that we are finally cleared to take off. The fasten seat belt sign is now on. We will be arriving in Atlanta shortly. Flight staff, please prepare for take off. I told you. Yes, you did. We just gotta keep the faith. Yeah, you know, God is strategic and his timing is always perfect. It is. So I was thinking maybe we can grab dinner while we're both in Atlanta. I'd love that. Great. So much pressure for me. - Yeah, I believe it. - Trice, Trice! Oh, there's my sister and her fiance. Aw. Oh my goodness. We've been watching the weather reports and it was so scary. I didn't think you were gonna make it. You know I wasn't gonna miss your wedding for the world. - You better not. - Come here. - Hi Shaun. - Hey Trice. Glad you made it. I know, me too. Jordan. Jordan.
