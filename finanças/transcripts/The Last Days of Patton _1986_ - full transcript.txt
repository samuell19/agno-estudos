[MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING] REPORTER: General Patton. How long do you plan to bee here in Boston? -Well, I'm in the States for a month on a war bond selling tour. The war may be over in Europe, but we still have the Japs to lick. Our boys will do it too with your bonds and their bluff. REPORTER: Will you be joining General MacArthur in the Pacific? -No, I've been appointed proconsul of Bavaria. REPORTER: But would ya like to go to the Pacific? -Yes, I'd love to go and fight the Japanese. REPORTER: Mrs. Patton. Mrs. Patton, how long has it bee since you've seen the general. -Two years and seven months. When he left he told me he thought he'd-- he'd die fighting. It seems a miracle that he's back, even if it is just for a short leave. REPORTER: How long have you and the general been married? -35 years. REPORTER: Oh General Patton, sir, could you-- could you tell our readers your secret for a long and happy marriage? -Well to begin with you have to start off with marrying the right person. Now as to what Beatrice got out of the bargain, you'll have to ask her. I think she's been cheated. It seemed wicked somehow to cross such a wonderful girl who loves such a fool. Trapped in the shape and fashion of that condition, I've always been a very, very lucky man. REPORTER: Mrs. Patt, does the general talk in his sleep? -No. But if he ever does, I'll give him my undivided attention. REPORTER: Mrs. Patton. BEATRICE PATTON: Yes. REPORTER: As the wife of a famous general who is frequently in the headlines from being outspoken, do you have anything to say to the American Press? GENERAL PATTON: be careful now, Bea. I BEATRICE PATTON: I respect all that is fair and courageous in the press. I would only ask you to understand that my husband at the tuff perfectionist. REPORTER: Now, general, would you give us a statement? -Gentlemen, I'm a soldier first and last. I'm not a politician, not a diplomat, not a statesman. And I make no alibis for the things that I say. Now, if you'll forgive me, my family and I are leaving for California. I want to pay a visit to my boyhood church in San Gabriel and give thanks to God before I go back to Germany. REPORTER: Good luck, General. -Who's in charge here? [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] -Let that Colonel through. This is the famous S.S., the elite of the German Army. Yes, you understand me. Pull yourself together, Colonel. The appearance of you and your men are a disgrace. You look like a bunch of vagrants at a convention of tramps. Now by tomorrow, I want you cleaned up and ready for inspection. We're going to have little spit and polish around here. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. We're going to use the POWs. -For what? -For work. -We have no advisories authorizing their use. The hell with advisories. We need wood cut. Every family should have enough wood to heat at least one room throughout the winter. Let the POWs cut it. -[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] -Charlie I saw your dad in the States. He sends you his best. Good to see you again. I'm just going to say a few words to the boys. DRILL SERGEANT: Atten hut. -All right, break ranks, everybody, and come up around here. Gather around here where I can see you and you can hear me. Well, we've got a big job here. Feeding and housing displaced Germans, and getting a decent government going. And it's not going to be easy. Keeping the peace is a battle too. When war is over, you just don't sit back and your fannies and stop fighting. War and peace are two sides of the same coin. You've got to be prepared to squash the next little wallpaper hanger that comes along. That's what most people don't seem to understand about preparedness. They think that we vanquished the last tyrant on earth. Well, they're wrong. Every generation breeds new ones. In time of peace, prepare for war. Those aren't my words, gentlemen. Those are the words of General George Washington. Thank you, very on. -Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce General Patton. -Be seated, please gentlemen. As you know, I've been appointed military Governor of Bavaria. That means that I am responsible for the welfare of the entire civilian population. Now, we have a lot of problems here. Food, clothing medicine, fuel, in short, survival. In my estimation, this issue takes precedent over purging local governments of minor officials who have been accused without proof of paying lip service to the Nazi party. Now, you people are here today because you are the men who run Bavaria. You know how to get the job done. All I can say about that is that whatever your past affiliations, if you do them well, you keep your jobs. Which of you is Minister President Schaefer? -I am, General. -Doctor Schaefer, there are those in the American government who believe that the German economy should be broken. Needless to say, I'm not one of them. But I want you and your cabinet to put Bavaria on its feet before winter. If it is not, you will answer to me. -Yes, General. -Thank you, gentlemen. That's all. [KNOCK ON DOOR] GENERAL PATTON: Yes? -Excuse me, General, but these just came in. -What are they? -This one is a hospital this is fuel availability, this is water supply, here's railroads, this one's electric power. GENERAL PATTON: Fine, fine, fine. These require signatures. GENERAL PATTON: Clear. -Oh, and this is the redeployment policy. -That will be all. Thank you, lieutenant. -Sorry, sir. [SIGHS] [PHONE RINGS] [KNOCK AT DOOR] -Sir, it's General Bedell Smith on the phone. -That's what I was afraid of. Yes, Bedell. Well, I'm carrying out Ike's orders as fast as I can. I don't care about the professor's report. Yes, I read it. My concern here is to get enough wood to keep people from freezing to death this winter, not to kick out every little file clerk who said heil Hitler. Yes. Uh, Bedell, it took me 40 weeks to conquer this part of Germany. Now, it's going to take a reasonable amount of time to replace all the officials would were Nazi's. You can't do it overnight. Even if it means turning the local government into a shambles? Yeah, well I'll keep that in mind. -To all units. With reference to the promotion system, I see no reason why-- -Excuse me. -Georgie, what can I do for you? -Nothing. I just want to get rid of these lousy cigars. I'm going to stop smoking them for good. You can have them. -Where was I? -With references to the promotion system, I see no reason. -I see no-- George. What's the matter? George, are you OK? -Sure, I'm fine. I supposed you heard that my transfer to the Pacific is out. -Ah, you just might still go to China. -I doubt it. Unless Doug MacArthur steps on a landmine. -Let's face it. He's the one who's pulling the strings. He just doesn't want the competition. -Mm, yeah. Two primadonnas is one too many. Now I've got Bedell Smith on my back. Apparently he speaks for Ike nowadays. According to the beatle, Ike is unhappy with my efforts in de-Nazifying this place. He wants a clean sweep now. Everyone with any Nazi affiliation is out on his butt. That means I'm supposed to fire the entire Schaefer cabinet and refill it with displaced Jews and communists who don't know anything about running the country. Well, the hell with it. -Every civil servant in Germany paid homage to the party. If he didn't he was out of a job. -I think it's stupid. I'm going to drag my feet as long as I can. -Watch out for Beatle. He's Ike's official hatchet man. -He's a son of a bitch. -General Eisenhower, General Smith has arrived. GENERAL EISENHOWER (ON INTERCOM): It's about time. Send him in. -Yes sir. You may go in, general. -Thank you. -You're late. -Sorry, Ike. -OK, let's have it. Is he going to follow my directive or not? -He says he needs more time. -More time. An order is an order. What's the American Army doing in Germany if not to rid the administration of Nazi's? -George calls them ex-Nazis. -Bull. They're Nazi's in my book. How many of them does George have in key positions? -Schaefer's the main one, and there are 20 under him. -20? -He's also got a whole entourage of Nazi's on his household staff. You know, Ike, it seems to me that with the chief of staff job coming up in Washington, wind of this could become a stumbling block to your appointment. It all reflects back on you, you know. -I should have sent George home after he slapped that soldier in Sicily. -We believe that two in this household are with the Nazi Secret Service, which is still operating. -I'm going to go talk with him, have this out. I'll fly to Munich tomorrow. You want to come? -No, I'd better not. Georgia hates my guts. -You going riding this morning, General. -Uh, yes. -What would you like for breakfast. -Oh, just orange juice. How long have you been with me, George? -About a year, sir. -And what do I always have for breakfast. -Just orange juice. -Anything else? -No, sir. -Then why in hell do you ask me every morning what I want for breakfast. -When I don't ask, is when you ask for ham and eggs. BARON WANGENHEIM: These are magnificent animals. GENERAL PATTON: Well, they come from France. BARON WANGENHEIM: How did you come by them? GENERAL PATTON: Well, Baron, you might say the Third Army liberated them. BARON WANGENHEIM: I see. GENERAL PATTON: Sad, almost every boy in America knows how to run a car, but very few of them understanding anything about horses. I suppose they think that horses fun on gasoline. I guess if you have to govern Bavaria, this is a good place to do it from. You know, I have no animosity towards professional soldiers like yourself. BARON WANGENHEIM: I'm grateful to hear that, General. -Well, I enjoy our talks. -It's been a revelation to meet an American gentleman who is informed about the communist aim in Europe. -I'm informed all right. The trouble is, most of my rubber legged colleagues are scared to death of offending the Bolsheviks. They think that treaties and votes will keep the wolf at bay. The Fatherland must be saved. Germany will need a champion. -I know. I've done everything I can. There's never been a better chance at producing a war as we have in Europe right now. With the German troops I'm holding and my own men, I could push the Russians all the way back to Moscow. [SIRENS] -Georgie. -You old horse thief Come on. What's new? -Oh, things are going very well. I've gotten reports that conditions in certain DP camps are deteriorating. So I decided to come see for myself. And since this happened to be on the way, well I guess I just wanted to see you. GENERAL PATTON: You know I'm always glad to see you. -Georgie. How long have we known each other? GENERAL PATTON: Mm, 20, 25 years. Let's see, Camp Coal, Pennsylvania, 1918. My God, how young we were. Starting out into the unknown. You're my oldest friend. -I remember, once you told me you thought your life and mine were under the protection of some supreme fate. -I didn't know what my life would largely depend on you. You could easily have forgotten me after that incident in Sicily, but you gave me Third Army instead. -I claim an almost proprietary interest in you, Georgie. I have. I have taken a lot of stands for you. -I know you have. I'm grateful. GENERAL EISENHOWER: But Friendship is one thing, our professional relationship is another. As you know, I've announced a firm policy for de-Nazifying local administrations. -Even if they fall apart? -Yes. But they won't. -That's debatable. -Not anymore. The debatable stage of the question long passed. Any opposition to the faithful execution of my order will not be regarded leniently by me, friend or no friend. -Yes, sir. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] DRILL SERGEANT: Company on guard. General. REPORTER: Tell us, General. Do you think the de-Nazification program can be carried out by commanders who are tempermentally and emotionally in disagreement with it? GENERAL EISENHOWER: I don't think we have anyone like that. REPORTER: Oh? But what about General Patten? Hasn't he opposed? -No. -General Smith, are you familiar with General Patton's most recent statement on Saturday? -I'm not prepared to discuss that now. -Well, he said, and I quote, "it is no more possible for a man to have been a civil servant in Germany and not have paid lip service to Nazism than it is for a man to be a postmaster in America and not have paid lip service to the Democratic or Republican parties when in power." Do you agree with General Patton's analogy? -Ms. Mcnully, I'm sure General Patton didn't mean to equate the Republican Party with the Nazi party. -Those are his own words. -He also said that he personally never saw any necessity to de-Nazify, since 98% of the Nazis were pushed into it anyway. -General Patton is a soldier and will carry out his orders. REPORTER: General Smith. -General Smith, is it true that former Nazis are still holding office in Bavaria? -As I said, General Patton will carry out his orders. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. -This canal in operation, General, transport between Munich and the southern cities will be facilitated. Barges with food and fuel will supply hundreds of thousands in need. There, General. And we will have two more canals fully repaired before winter. -Good work, Doctor. Congratulate your people for me. Whatever their sentiments a year ago, they know how to get the work done. The Russians would have taken two years to repair the locks. Then they would have had the water running the wrong way. BARON WANGENHEIM: Very good, General GENERAL PATTON: That's high praise coming from you. BARON WANGENHEIM: Where did you learn the skill? GENERAL PATTON: Baron, I'm an old saber-rattling cattleman from way back. BARON WANGENHEIM: Ah, no wonder. GENERAL PATTON: Good. Hey. -You're looking good, George. -Yeah, well, the Baron's got a wicked attack. [LAUGHS] Well, too bad you're not one of them Pinko journalists we had over here on Saturday. BARON WANGENHEIM: But without the padded vest. -More problems with the press, General? -Yes, the ragtag, bobtailed remnants of the great U.S. press. I don't get it. I used to have them on my side, didn't I? -Always. -Now they try to provoke me, put words in my mouth. BARON WANGENHEIM: They certainly did Saturday. -I lost my temper. I should have known better. What's that? -It's from Ike. -Stick it right there. -So the Nazis are just like Republicans and Democrats, George. -They twisted my words. I was trying to make a point. You made it, all right. In the New York Times, you created a major scandal. GENERAL PATTON: I withdrew the remark. -Well, that'll do a lot of good now. Sit down. George, the war was about Nazis. And for you to say they were just another political party. -That isn't what I meant. GENERAL EISENHOWER: These SS troops you're holding. -What about them? -You got them drilling like they're going into combat tomorrow. -Well, they look like bums. I'm trying to give them back their self-respect. -SS units don't need self-respect. We don't want them to have self-respect. Now, I don't believe this, but I've been told that you'd like nothing better than to provoke a showdown with the Russians and combine those SS troops with your Third Army. -That's crazy. -Crazy is right. But is it true? -No sir, it is not. But I have to admit, I wouldn't mind having a crack at those mongrels. -What mongrels? Those Russians are our allies. I've said this to you 100 times and you persistent in these hostile statements. GENERAL PATTON: I disagree with you, that's all. -You can't disagree with me. It's not a matter of opinion. It's a matter of policy. You will carry out my policies. Now about this Schaefer situation. -Uh, that's under investigation. -I appointed you administrator of Bavaria. And you retained the minister president who employs 20 Nazis in his cabinet, 20. -Where did you get that information? Norin. Professor Walter Norin. He's our expert on de-Nazification. -Probably a communist in disguise. -I checked this out myself. This Schaefer has 16 Nazi friends in agriculture and 4 in finance, all cases for mandatory removal under my instructions. -I can't disrupt the administration of Bavaria over some vague accusations. My Anglo-Saxon ancestry makes me reluctant to remove people without due process of law. -Due process. -I will carry out your wishes to the letter. -And in spirit. -And in spirit. -About this Wangenheim you ride with. -He's a fine horseman. Won a gold medal in '36 Olympics. He was a colonel in the SS. -So I understand. -And that's all you understand? -Look, Ike, I realize that sometimes I'm a political embarrassment to you. But Bavaria is running like a clock. I've got that place moving. We're rebuilding, and we're going to be on our feet before any other part of Germany. But if it is an embarrassment to you, if it's causing you problems about getting into the White House. -What did you say? -I think you'd make a great president. -Oh don't give me that crap. -I'd campaign for you, myself. -Shut up, George, and listen. If you think that what I've said is motivated by personal interest, you're badly mistaken. And you're impugning my honor. There's nothing dishonorable about seeking political office. -It's your mouth, George. You can't control it. You never could. And I'll tell you something else. It getting so bad that people think there's something wrong with you. Now, I admire your good qualities, but I've got to face facts. You're just no military governor. I believe it would be in your best interests if you gave up command of the Third Army. -You're relieving me? -I'm transferring you. General Gerow is going home. I'm giving you command of the 15th Army in Bad Nauheim. -The 15th. It's a paper army. They're writing the history of the war. That's no army. They've never fired a shot. -No one has to fire any more shots, George. That's something you've got to understand. The war is over. Now, I admire you. Your audacity, your ability. But those very qualities that made you great in wartime are a pain in the neck in peacetime. If you're planning on spending the night, of course you're welcome to stay with me. But I imagine you'd rather get home as soon as possible? -Yeah. I'll leave now. DRILL SERGEANT: Atten hut. Right shoulder arms. -And Hep, don't take too long. -I won't. I'll join you in three days. -You know, I'm going to kind of miss this place. -You'll get over it. -I always have. I had the same sort of sentimental attachment to the Seventh Army as I have to the Third. But, I got over it. -Good to see you, George. George, welcome to the 15th Army. -Atten hut. GENERAL PATTON: At ease. As you were. -Well, George, this is it. Reports from theater commanders, staff reports, analytical studies on tactics, more comes in every day. -I'd like to review the troops. -I'm afraid you just did. -Looks like a paper army, all right. -That's what it is. -Well, Paul, you'd better lay in a supply of the most essential piece of equipment we're going to need. -What's that, George? -Eye drops. - GENERAL EISENHOWER (VOICEOVER): My darling Bea. It seems I've been kicked upstairs to the 15th Army. They sneaked me to my new command like a thief in the night. It's one hell of a way for Ike to treat me. But things will change, and I'll be way out in front again. This so-called Army is just a handful of clerks and a committee of officers whose job is to write a lot of stuff that no one will ever read. -Well, what do you think of the 15th Army? -Well, I think it's going to be fine, sir. Except it's a little dangerous. -Dangerous? -Yes sir. One of the cooks told me two clerks got buried under a ton of paper the other day. It took six hours to dig them out. Their bodies were covered in ink. -Smudged to death, huh? -That's it, sir. -[CHUCKLES] Go, on to bed. -Yes, sir. Good night, General. -Good night, George. GENERAL EISENHOWER (VOICEOVER): I look forward to Christmas with you. Officially, I'm calling it a 30 day leave, but it'll be for good. I don't intend to come back to Europe unless it's to fight in the next war. I'm getting out, Bea. I just want to look into your brave, loyal eyes again. My conscience is clear, Bea. If a man's done his best, what more is there? -General? General Patton. Good evening, General. -Stay, Willie. -Welcome to the Grand Hotel, General. Colonel Harkins has asked that I conduct you to him. Eh-- if you'll please follow me. -Ah, this won't take too long, Woody. Than a quick drink with Colonel Harkins and back to the damn paperwork. -Yes, sir. -You've got to give Willie a walk. -Yes, sir. GENERAL EISENHOWER (VOICEOVER): I know I'm right i what I did and the rest can go to hell. Or I hope they can, because it's going to be pretty crowded down there. At the moment, I feel mad. My public position is that Ike has done me a favor by giving me this new assignment. But my private opinion is that practically everyone but myself is a pusillanimous son of a bitch. CROWD [SINGING]: Happy birthday to you. I Happy birthday day to you. Happy birthday General Patton. Happy birthday to you. -Well, I'll be damned. [SINGING] -You take Doug MacArthur. He's got a craggy face. Mark Clark, he's got a weak chin. Besides, he gives me the creeps. Now, Ike's face is bland. Omar the Tentmaker, he's got a very strong jaw. It makes an impression the first time around, until you realize how really mediocre. Then Monty, we have Monty. Monty has the expression of a ferocious rabbit. And then we come down to Beatle Smith. The only problem with Beatle's face is it shows. [CLANGING GLASS] PAUL: Gentlemen, gentlemen, please. Ladies, may I have your attention please? Thank you. Six months ago, we were still fighting a war with Nazi Germany. A war to liberate Europe from the oppression of the Third Reich. The armed forces of the U.S.A. and her allies won that war. A large measure of credit for that achievement goes to a man whose hell raising leadership galvanized his men to victory in Africa, Sicily, France, and Germany. The exploits of the Third Army made history because of an extraordinary general whose me would follow him anywhere. -Would any of you gentlemen care to test it? Would it kill me if I ran my had through it, sir? -I invite you to try it, Johnson, at your own risk. Patton, how about you? -Yes, sir. -Today is the bosses' birthday. And we're here to thank him for being a rip roarin' soldier and a warm-hearted friend. So, so, this toast to General George S. Patton. Happy birthday, and long life. God bless you. -It's reassuring to know that I'm still a fairly good sized social lion. I thank you, Paul, Jeff, everyone. I don't have very much to say, except-- you know-- that the most difficult thing for a general to do is make up his mind. And then, of course, to withstand the gruesome rumors that are thrust upon him by less stout-hearted people. No, I've-- I've been in a lot of trouble lately with the press and some of my colleagues. Most of them were supposed to be my friends. I guess it's my own fall. But it reminds me of a young woman friend of mine who had a baby recently. And she said, oh, it's so wonderful to be able to roll over and lie on my tummy again. I said, my dear child, had you maintained that position originally, you probably would not be in your recent unenviable committee. I thank you-- I thank you for your toast and your praise. And I would like to save that George S. Patton was simply a hook upon which to hang the Third Army. And I can tell you this. The Third Army is the best thing that has ever happened to George S. Patton. MAN: George S. Patton was the best thing that ever happened to the whole damn Army. -Well, I am 60 years old today. Last time a war ended, I wrote a poem for my wife, Beatrice. I don't feel quite up to it now, but I would like to say one, two lines from my favorite poet, Rudyard Kipling. "Two things greater than all things are. The first love, and the second war. And since we know not how war may prove, heart of my heart, let us talk of love." [SINGING - FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW] -Our difficulty with the Russian is we forget he's not European but Asiatic. Therefore, he thinks deviously. We can no more understand those mongrel savages than we can understand Chinamen or Japs. On my opinion, the Bolshevik is a congenital liar, a barbarian, and a chronic drunk. It would be fun to kill a few of them. -Am I missing out on something here? -Sit down, Jeff. Pull up a chair. You remember my wife's niece, Jean Gordon? -Of course. -Keyes just took over my old outfit, the Seventh Army at Heidelberg. -Well, it's good to see you again, General. -Paul, I think you went to a lot of trouble to raise this party. -My pleasure, George. I just wish Beatrice could have been here. Well, Bea's probably mapping out my holiday leave. -If I know Bea, you won't have a free minute. -Would you care to dance? -Yes. -He doesn't like me. -Who? -General Keyes. I can tell. -Don't be silly. He's probably thinking what a lucky old fool I am. That perfume. -It's over, isn't it? -The war, yes. -You know what I mean. -Yes, it's over. -General Bigwig. -What? -I have a confession to make. I wanted the war to go on just a little longer. Isn't that incredible. I'm so ashamed. How could anyone be so selfish. I'll be so lonely without you. Why does everything come too late? -When the hair turns gray and love looks out of an old man's eyes. -That's not what I meant. It is beautiful though. Who wrote it, Yeats? -No. -I don't know. Browning? -No. -Who then? -Bigwig. -You're a remarkable poet, General Bigwig. -[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. -[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. -[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. -Your West Point French has improved, Lieutenant Patton. -No wonder. I was 107th in a class of 123. -Oh, that's 16th from the bottom. Obviously, I didn't marry you for your prowess in languages. -For what, then? -Oh, you're fishing for compliments again, Lieutenant. -You know, Mrs. Patton, you really are rather pretty for a retired debutante. -I couldn't sleep last night. Want to know why? -No. -What? -I couldn't either. Why? -I was thinking about us. What it would be like being married. Being alone together at last. -You may not sleep tonight either. -Where were you? -Mm? -You're somewhere else. -With you in my arms? Don't be ridiculous. -Hold me tight. --[SINGING] It's Lily from Piccadilly. She is the blackout queen. Lily from Piccadilly, ugliest girl I've seen. With searchlights moving overhead 'til [NON ENGLISH SPEECH] are gone, don't take her gas mask off, she looks much better with it on. Lily from Piccadilly, she is the blackout queen. a -Come on, everybody sing it. It's-- -[SINGING] Lily from Piccadilly. She is the blackout queen. Oh, Lilly from Piccadilly, ugliest girl I've seen. --[SINGING] Her wig should never bother you, she's several missing parts. One glass eye, and wooden leg, she's still the queen of tarts. -[SINGING] Lily from Piccadilly. She is the blackout queen. It's Lily from Piccadilly, she is the blackout queen. Lily from Piccadilly, ugliest girl I've seen. Who cares if she has pigeon toes, a voice that's rather harsh. She's one good trait, an RAF type handlebar moustache. Oh Lily from Piccadilly queen of the blackout, lays her neck out, she won't let you back out, you won't pay a stack out for Lily the blackout queen. [BUZZER] -Hello? Holy cow. Private first class Woodring here, over. SERGEANT MEEKS (ON PHONE): This is Sergeant Meeks. Wake up, Private. General Patton and General Gay are going pheasant hunting south of Mannheim And you're driving, over. -But he's going back to the States tomorrow. SERGEANT MEEKS (ON PHONE): And he's going hunting today. -Like, when? SERGEANT MEEKS (ON PHONE): Like in 20 minutes. And the General wants to use the limo. Joe Spokes will follow in the truck with the guns and dog, over. -What time is it, anyway? SERGEANT MEEKS (ON PHONE): Time to move your butt. Over and out. [DOG BARKING] -Hey, Woody. I seen you last night with that big, blonde Fraulein. -Why not tell the whole world about it? -Oh, don't worry. If they catch you fraternizing again, what more can they do to you? You've already been demoted to the bottom of the heap. Come on, it's half past 7:00. When are we leaving? -Whenever they want. Now, you got the guns? -Yeah, yeah. They're in the back. Hey, do you think she could get me a Kraut girlfriend? I'm getting really lonely. -Yeah, I'll bet. -I swear. -Willie, kill. -Come on, Mr. Willie. Inside, boy. -I got him from a pound in London. Ugliest thing I've ever seen. He's going to be a real scrapper, I thought. I'm going to name him after William the Conqueror. He's the biggest coward in dogdom. Maybe I should have slapped. -Very funny. -Well, what are we going to do with him? All right, you be a good boy while daddy's gone. -Good morning, Woody. -Good morning, sir. -Morning, Woody. -Spruce got the directions? -Yes sir, I told him to just follow us. -Just keep him in sight. I-- I don't mind losing Spruce. It's Englebert I'm worried about. -I visited with King George in Belgium last month. Woody got me back to Bad Nauheim in less than two hours. 70 miles an hour, through all the checkpoints. You should have seen him scurry. -Didn't Woody used to be a sergeant? -Oh, yes. But he's devoted to the local ladies. Woody is constantly in love. -Life's unfair. So many Frauleins and no fraternization around. -Well, it's a stupid idea. You can't control sex. All that moralistic garbage. We both know that when morals go down, morale goes up. It's a heck of a problem. -But apparently one that Woody enjoys wrestling with. -Sergeant says to the private-- he says, well son, what would you like to learn in this man's army. And the recruit says I-- I'd like to learn to drive a tank, sir. And he says, well in that case, I won't stand in your way. You'd think if my chief of staff won't laugh at my jokes, at least my driver would. -Oh, sorry, sir. It was really funny. -It's just that I've heard it a few times before. -But not from me you haven't. I haven't even thought of that joke in years. I haven't told it since I can't remember when. I'll tell you one thing though, I'll but when I did tell it the last time, I probably brought the house down. GENERAL PATTON: So the sergeant says, tell me private, what you want to learn in this man's army? And the recruit says, I want to learn how to drive a tank, sir. Well, says the sergeant, in that case, private, I won't stand in your way. This model is a revolutionary design. -Its revolutionary, all right. Damn contraption. GENERAL PATTON: Now, I ask that you gentlemen use your imagination. For as you can see, this experimental model has very little armor plating yet and no superstructure. For our purposes though, it will demonstrate what you gentlemen from the War Department need to see in order to make your evaluation and recommendation to the ordinance department. This new model can break through buildings, push trees over, and plough through stand at 30 miles an hour. This little iron buggy is so easy to handle, even a the child could drive it. I've got an idea. Now, how about one of you gentlemen take me up for the trial run. Huh, how about it? Now gentlemen, there is no need for stage fright. How about a run around the field? Wouldn't someone like to take the first ride? All right. Bea, you demonstrate it for the gentlemen. -Of course, darling. -You see how easy it is to handle, gentleman? Now, who'd like to give it a try? -Thank you, Colonel Patton. We a-- I think we've seen enough. And you'll be hearing from us in time. -Gentlemen. -Thank you. -They were horrid, the pompous old fogies. -They aren't important. -But your presentation, they tried to make a foo-- -Forget them. Thank you, my dearest. WOODY: That guy must be crazy. He is crazy. -So you two just sail right through the checkpoints, huh? Not like the rest of us peasants? WOODY: Can't the idiot see the four stars on this tub? -Oh, Woody. He's only doing his job. Look at him shiver. Would you like to trade places with him? -From the way he carries on, you'd never know he's just a PFC. -Says he wants to see your identification, sir. Says it's regulations. -Well, he's right. It is regulations. Well, Hap, we've run into a young man who is not impressed with Old Blood and Guts. What am I going to do with him? -Charm him, Georgie. -Morning, young man. -Hello, sir. -I'm General George S. Patton, commanding the 15th Army at Bad Nauheim. I understand that you want to see my identification. -Yes, sir. That is if you don't mind. -All right. Here we are. Thank you, sir. You may pass. -What's your name? -Corporal Philip Leach, sir. -Philip. Good name. Strong name. Like strong names. It means you're a lover of horses. Do you like horses, Philip? -Oh, yes sir. -Good for you. Well, Phil, I'm going to see that your CO finds out just what a good MP you make. -Oh really? Thank you, sir. -Spruce. SPRUCE: Yes, sir. -Bring Englebert up here, put him in the front seat. Poor thing will freeze to death in that damn truck. -They say a reasonable number of fleas is good for a dog. Keeps him from brooding over being a dog. -Well, he's sure a lot better off than some of the poor devils scratching around here, hm? I don't understand, Hep. All I wanted to do was help build a new Germany. All this ballyhoo about de-Nazification. -I know. But face it, Georgie, you were Ike's champion and runner. And when you didn't follow his directives, he took you out of the game. It's as simple as that. He calls the plays. -Well, it all boils down to one thing. Ike is bitten by the presidential bug, and he doesn't want me rocking the boat. But he will never be president, I'm telling you that right now. Trouble is, I'm an anachronism in peacetime. I never was very good at political bootlicking. Now with FDR gone, the new gang in Washington hates my guts. Then they go and drop a bomb and end the Pacific War, probably make people like me obsolete, I don't know. I feel myself driven toward an end I cannot see. But I know as soon as I reach it, as soon as I become unnecessary, an atom will suffice to shatter me. -Georgie. That doesn't sound like you. -Because Napoleon said it. -Oh. -Good. -Well, I'm going home tomorrow and retire of my scrapbooks. -Write a book. You always wanted to. With the story you have to tell, it'll be the greatest book to come out of World War II. -Well, maybe. But to spill the beans on people like the Beatle, I-- I'd hate to do it. -Love to do it. -I'd love to do it. Of course, I will continue to wear my Eisenhower jacket, so that everyone can kiss my backside. It is not I who have lost the Athenians, but the Athenians who have lost me. -But I hate the rubbish. Well, we sure left them a mess to clean up. Not a living thing. Not even a chicken. Am I getting soft? I did most of it, heroes like me. Trains do something to me. Make me sad. I'm wandering forever at the earth again. Did you ever read Of Time and the River? -No. -We hurtle onward in the darkness, down a million roads. GENERAL PATTON (VOICEOVER): When papa died, I was too late for the funeral. For an hour I stood there. And I realized that the grave no more held papa than did one of his discarded suits still hanging in the closet. Suddenly, I seemed to see him in the road, wearing his checked overcoat and waving his stick as he used to do when he was impatient with me. -I salute not you, papa, but this last resting place and the beautiful body I've loved. Your soul is with me. And but for the density of my eyes, I could see you and talk with you. Oh, darling papa. I stopped calling you that when I grew up. But you were, and are, my darling. I never did much for you, and you did everything for me. [TRAIN WHISTLE] -I drank so much beer last night, my gut feels like a beer glass. -Yeah, it looks like one too, Dexter. -Hah hah. -Melvin, you got the hiccups. -No. -You guys know what hiccups are? -No, what? -Messages from departed spirits. -Hey, come on, you jokers. Move it or get-- -Look at that, four stars. There's only one four star left in the European Theater. It's got to be Old Blood and Guts. It's the old man himself. Hah. -Come on, come on. -Son of a bitch. -Oh my God. Sir. Are you hurt? -Not a bit. -How do you figure? -Out. -General, sir. -My, my neck hurts. I'm having trouble breathing. Work my fingers for me, will you Hap? -Sure. Here. -Of all the stupid idiot things to happen. Damn it all to hell. Go ahead, Hep, work my fingers. Lieutenant, you'd better take charge. I don't think we should move the General. -Yes, sir. I'll get an ambulance. I'll be right back. -Here it comes. [AMBULANCE SIREN] -Day before I'm supposed to ship home. Isn't that ironic? -General, I'm Doctor Snyder. -Hep, I think I'm paralyzed. MAN: Keep back, please. Keep back, move back. Move back. -I'm so sorry, sir. -I don't hold you responsible. You're a good driver. Is Englebert all right? WOODY: Yes sir, he's fine. -You take care of him for me, will you? -Yes, sir. And Willie too. -Yes, sir. -Woody. -Yes, sir? -Take care of yourself. -God bless you, sir. -All right, take off. Go. Go. [AMBULANCE SIREN] MAN: Lieutenant, are you all right? -I have to get back on the horse. I've got to finish the race. MAN: All right, come on. Let's go. They're here. WOMAN (ON INTERCOM): Colonel Ball, please report to Emergency. DOCTOR: Wipe that table. WOMAN (ON INTERCOM): Colonel Ball, please report to emergency. DOCTOR: Be careful with him, boys. WOMAN: We'll get the blood samples. DOCTOR: Good, then transfusions. Lines in both arms. Lips are cyanotic. WOMAN: Get the suture tray. DOCTOR: Use the [INAUDIBLE] position, no jarring. And Bertha, keep him on the stretcher for the time being. I don't want to jostle him around. MAN: How are the reflexes? WARREN: I'm not getting anything. There's no evidence of fracture, though. DOCTOR: Warran you'd better get the portable x-ray machine. We can't take him up there. -OK but I'll need some help. That thing weighs about 600 pounds. DOCTOR: Bertha, cut away his clothes immediately. BERTHA: Yes, sir. DOCTOR: Don't remove the portions underneath him. GENERAL PATTON: Damn. -What is it, General? -I was just thinking, a hell of a way to start a vacation. WOMAN: Now General, stop fussing. GENERAL PATTON: Watch out with those scissors, that's all. I may not have much feeling down there now, but-- WOMAN: Don't worry, General. Bertha's been doing this for years. Not a casualty yet. GENERAL PATTON: Cut away. MAN: These are handsome revolvers, General. Ivory handles. GENERAL PATTON: Try it. I've made as many as 15 successive bulls eyes. MAN: I'll keep them in the strongbox. BERTHA: There, General. WOMAN: Diastolic pressure is improving, Doctor. DOCTOR: Good. Transfusion's running OK? WOMAN: Yes, sir. And the pulse is steadying now. WOMAN (ON INTERCOM): Colonel Ball, please report to Emergency. Colonel Ball, please report to Emergency. MAN: Color's coming back to normal. No sign of hematoma in the temporal region. DOCTOR: Good. WOMAN: 110 over 76. DOCTOR: Good. Pulse? -A regular 60. -It was 45 and south when he came in. -Congratulations, General. You're doing just fine. Does this hurt? -No. -Well, General. You seem to be in good form. I'm Colonel Ball. -In good form, maybe. Definitely not good shape, Colonel. -General has no sensation from here down, but we're x-raying shortly. -General, can you move your arms, your legs at all? -Very good, General. -All I want is for you to patch me up and get me out of here. My wife's expecting me at home. [COUGHING] -See that? -We noted that. It's the one reflex he has whenever he coughs. -If there's no doubt in your minds that I'm going to be paralyzed for the rest of my life, let's cut out all this crap right now and let me die. -This is the0 main present. -I think he'll like it. -Well, I hope so. You know your father hates presents. But the salesman said it's the most practical hunting jacket they had. -Don't worry, mother. He'll love it. -Oh, I hope so. [PHONE RINGS] Ruth, darling, would you get the phone, please? -Hello? Oh, hello, Fred. Yes, she is. Just a moment. It's Uncle Fred. -Thanks. Fred? I are you? What? When? How serious is it? Yes, of course. Call me back as soon as you know. I'll-- I'll be here. Your father's been in an automobile accident. He's in a hospital in Heidelberg. -Mother. How bad is it? -They don't know. But I've got to go right away. -Do you want me to go with you? -No, no dear. -Mother. He's been in bad shape before. He's going to be all right. Yes, of course he is. -Now, General, when did you last urinate? -When was it? 10:00 AM. I can't remember. Who keeps a log on that? -Where'd you get all these scars, General? Take a look at this, Colonel. -Souvenirs of battle? -I'm sorry to disappoint you gentlemen, but my only battle scar is that wound on my rump. I got it in 1918. It's a hell of a place for a soldier to get shot, I can tell you that. Truth of the matter is, I turned around to see that my men were following me. -We believe you, General. -You better believe me. Most of the others are from football or riding horses. I've broken my nose, both ankles, both legs, all kinds of rigs. Gashes, cuts, scrapes, you name it. I've been kicked in the head by horses more times than I can remember. You think it shows? Some people think it shows. -Colonel, Father White is here to see the General. -Hello, Father. -Afternoon, Colonel. -Janet, how are you? -Just fine, Father. Father White's here, General. Are you a Catholic? -What difference does that make? In my condition, I can use all the help I can get. Come on in, Padre. Just keep it brief and to the point, hm? Trouble is, most preachers-- when there's nothing more to be said, they're still saying it. -Very good, General. -General Case, sir. My name's Major Boardman. I'm PRIO at this hospital. -Major. What's the word on General Patton? -Not good, I'm afraid, sir. The General's in serious condition, in Emergency. -May I see him. -Will the General wait here? I'll see what can be done. -Very well, Major. -[NON ENGLISH SPEECH] Amen. -Thank you, Father. I don't know what you said, but you sure did me some good. WOMAN: Colonel, it's the Protestant chaplain to see the General. -Well, send him in. Another one more or less won't hurt. Let him go to work on me. MAN: We have the x-rays, sir. -Unstable fractured dislocation. -No, I'm sorry sir. I can't tell you anything about the General's condition. You'll just have to wait until Major Morgan comes in. -OK. -Gentlemen, please. Now, ladies and gentlemen, my name is Major Morgan. I'm the public relations officer in this hospital. -Well what's going on, Major? -How bad is he? -I have only one thing to say. There will be no medical bulletins issued today. It's far too early for the exact nature of the injuries suffered by General Patton to be known. -Is it true that he's paralyzed. -Will he live? -Thank you, thank you. That's all I have to say today. -Over there, Hap. Go on, I'll get some coffee. You want anything to eat? -No. -Black? -Yes. -Here. -Thank you. -Well, I guess the news hounds have all gone home for the night. -Yeah, but they'll be back and force tomorrow. -Well, don't worry. I think tomorrow I'll authorize Colonel Ball to bar the press from the hospital altogether. I don't want a big nuisance You'd better get some sleep. You look awful. -To lead armies through two world wars. And then to have this happen. It's crazy. Falling off a car seat and breaking your neck? -Georgie's going to have the best there is, Hap. One neurosurgeon's coming from the States and one from Oxford. -He's got to live, Chief. He's got to write a book. Only this morning we were talking about him writing a book. -His memoirs could be the most important book of the times. -Exactly. What's his condition? Hi-- his true condition? They don't tell me anything. -Colonel Hill's diagnosis, supported by x-rays, spinal column behind the neck fracture at third and fourth vertebrae. Patient breathing with only one side of diaphragm. Bladder and bowels paralyzed. All sensation below the neck absent. Crutchfield tongs have been fastened in the skull to provide traction to the spinal column. -My name is Kerwin, Lieutenant Colonel Walter Kerwin. I'm serving as temporary aid to Mrs. Patton. She's been waiting for two hours and Colonel Sperling hasn't arrived yet. I think he's coming on a C47 from Kentucky. If you find out anything, call me back. -Mrs. Patton. -Yes. -I'm Colonel Sperling. I've just arrived. Sorry to be so late. -Thank you for coming, Colonel Sperling. I know you've had to change your plans. -Mrs. Patton, I wouldn't want to be anywhere else but here. -Thank you. -Now, what do you say we go to Germany and see that husband of yours? -That is an excellent idea. -Now, Miss Gordon, normally I'd say no. It's against hospital regulations. But you are family. -Thank you, Colonel. -Your uncle's in here. He was sleeping last time I walked in. Colonel Hill prefers he not be disturbed. -Of course. I just want to be with him for a moment. I promise not to wake him. -Maybe you can come back again tomorrow. Why don't you call me? It'll be a full day for him though. -No, I won't be back. And please, Colonel, don't tell him I was here. -Georgie, it's not over for me. It never will be over. -Good morning, General. -Good morning, Colonel. -Sir, I have something here that I'm sure will please you. Dear General Patton. I am distressed at the painful accident which you have suffered, and want you to know that I am thinking of you at this time. You have won many a tough fight, and I know that faith and courage will not fail you in this one. I am thankful that Mrs. Patton will soon be at your side to strengthen and sustain you. With prayerful wishes for your recovery, Commander in Chief, former Captain Harry S. Truman. -It's funny, isn't it? The men become vice presidents who were never intended by party or god to be president. Yet, I think he'll do a good job. I would like you to thank those four soldiers who shared their blood with me. Will you be sure to do that for me, please? -Yes, I will. I'll check back later. That fragrance. You notice it, Colonel? It's like perfume. -Pam? I thought I saw you. You're early. -I couldn't sleep. This is one patient I don't want to be late for. If you want, you can sign out. -Really? Oh, thanks. -I'm so nervous. How is he? -He woke up at 5:00 and talked my leg off. Be sure to check the tongs. They refuse to stay in place. -OK. -Colonel Hill discussed the case with you? -Yes. -Good. Now, I had to give him sedation, and even then he was awake a lot. Oh, and he hates the IV bottles being in sight. He counts those drops like they were sheep. A neurosurgeon is flying in this morning with his assistant. -But there's one coming from the States. -They're not taking any chances. -Bertha. Is the General a-- well, you know, difficult? -He's a doll. Don't worry, you'll like him. He's rough and sort of cute. -Well I guess I'm ready to beard the lion in his den. Might as well get it over with. -They say he likes pretty women. -Oh. -Yeah, he's going to love you. -Good morning, young lady. -Good morning, General. -I feel much better today. I can move the index finger of my right hand. Look. -Well, that's wonderful. Let me see. Go ahead. Well, I think so. I do see a slight movement, yes. -I'm sorry sir, but I don't know. -Look honey, all we want is some simple facts. He's paralyzed, right? Well, that's what the rumor is. So how much paralyzed? Completely? Partially? -The first bulletins will be issued this afternoon detailing his progress and twice daily thereafter. -How do we get through to this dame? -Oh yes, of course General Keyes. [KNOCK AT DOOR] Come in. Well, we'll do that right away. Well, thank you very much, sir. Yeah. -Colonel, get well messages from everywhere. They're swamping us. Here's one from Lady Dove Cooper. And listen to this, "you will conquer this battle as brilliantly and courageously as you have all the others." Winston Churchill. -Well, that should boost the General's morale. Anyway, forget that just for a moment, Nancy. Take this down. And get it to the staff immediately. It won't help your people very much in the communication center, but it will make everybody else's job just a bit easier. By order, General Commanding Seventh Army, press and radio reporters are herewith barred from the hospital. -Thank you, Colonel. -And they will not be admitted inside the date, except at such time as a press conference is authorized. -Well, this is some way to treat the American Press. -Sorry, ma'am. -You don't look sorry. -That Major is rude. We're only doing our job. -That smug little jerk. He really enjoyed telling us to march. -Certainly rude to me. -Well, they haven't heard the last of it. The freedom of the press is involved here. -I only asked her if the General's privates were paralyzed. And she turned and walked away from me. I call that rude. If I weren't a lady, I'd-- -She sure could have fooled me. -Yes, I've always liked Catherine Cornell. Extremely good actress. Saw her twice in the Barretts of Wipole Street. Splendid performer. -Last time I was in London I saw the Lunts in There Shall be No Night. -Oh yes, by that fellow Sherwood. Did you like it? -Yes, very much. -I hated it. -Would you close your eyes, please? Feel that? -I think I feel something. Yes, I-- yes I do. -Where? -My chest on the right. -Good. -Right thoracic wall, patient localizes. And now? -I think so. Are you touching one of my legs? -Patellar tendon, unsure. So, Haymarket in the blackout was one nasty spot, hm? Pitch dark and play girls tumbling all over each other. -I was there during World War I. -Look up at the ceiling, would you please? I think the Haymarket's pretty much the same as it was then, really. -In one respect, it hasn't changed at all. -Oh, what's that? -A chippy who was somewhat past her prime wanted to take me home. -There you go. And what was your response to this aged enchantress of the evening? -I told her, I'm sorry, grandma, but you're just one war too late. -Your prognosis? -Uncertain, gentlemen. My examination confirms your diagnosis. -Do you recommend any changes in our present treatment? -I should recommend forcing more fluids. Keep the room cool, on the favor of traction, of course. But I'd say, increase to 10 pounds. And I'd dispense with the tongs and using these zygomatic hooks instead. -Yeah. Fishhooks under the cheekbones. It's painful. But you're right, it probably is necessary. -I, uh-- have the queerest sensation in my hands, as if my skin and flesh were trying to fall off my bones. It's the strangest feeling, like I was shedding my body. Maybe I'm shuffling off this mortal coil. -Well, the fact it's a sensation could be a good sign. -Dying has always intrigued me. The Hindu says it's the most exalted experience in life. Did you know that? -No, I didn't. I'm not afraid, only curious. So up heroes and forth they went, away from battleground, fortress, tent, mountain, wilderness, field, and farm. Death and the General, arm in arm. -Well, Georgie, I'd say the greatest man in the world was your grandfather. You want to know why? -Yes, sir. -Because he died for his country, leading his troops into battle. He died at the head of brave men, he carried a sword. Do you understand that? -Yes, sir. -One of the regrets of my life is that I'll never have the opportunity to die such a glorious death. No man can choose how he's born, a man is lucky if he can choose the circumstances of his death. And by that choice, signifies life. -He carried a sword? -He was a Brigadier General. And on that last cavalry charge, he ride a white horse. And he carried a sword. -Hello, Georgie. -It's good to see you, Bea. -I've seen you in these scrapes before. You always come out all right. -Would you like to stay at my place tonight, Bea? -No thanks, Jeff. I'd rather stay here. Perhaps at one of the rooms down the hall? -Of course. We'll arrange that. -Whatever you say. -I'll be here all night long. -Now, if there's anything you need or want, please don't hesitate. Just let me know. -There are just a few things. No visitors. DOCTOR: Agreed. -Even if they claim to be family relations, not unless I clear it. -Don't worry about that, Bea. -And under no circumstances is General Bedell Smith to be admitted. Please understand, under no circumstances. -I understand. -This is a list of books I'd like to read to Georgie. -We'll get right on it. -Thank you for everything you're doing. I hope for the best, I'm prepared for the worst. I just want you to know, you can level with me. DOCTOR: Tendon reflex is hyperactive in both lower extremities. A definite sweating in the C5 dermatome. -Sounds like I'm one step away from an autopsy. -Really, General. -That's not funny, George. -Sorry, Bea. -I apologize for getting you out of this wild goose chase, Colonel. I'm particularly sorry since it looks like you won't be able to spend Christmas with your family. -Well, General, with all the kids under foot, I don't think anybody will have time to miss me. -I don't believe that. You'll be missed all right. -Well, at the moment, the General seems to be in fairly stable condition. He's holding up remarkably well. Barring unforeseen complications, I think he's out of danger, as far as saving his life is concerned. -Gentlemen, I'm sure you realize that for all kinds of reasons, it's absolutely imperative that he survive. I don't care what it takes. Do whatever you can to keep him alive. [PHONE RINGS] -Yes, what is it? All right, I'll tell him. -Colonel, General Patton wants to see you. Alone. -You doctors amaze me. -How's that? -Repairing human wreckage the way you do. But I don't know if you'll be able to repair this wreck. -Well, we'll give it a try. -There's a hell of a lot at stake here. -Of course. -I don't mean just me. You see, I'm convinced that we'll be at war with Russia within five years. Maybe not the same kind of war as the last one. Not with that nuclear thing now. I see things changing, but war nevertheless. Those sons of bitches. They're going to push us hard. If there is war, I've got to be around to fight, too lead soldiers. That's all I can do, but I'm the best. Do you understand? Dammit, Colonel. I don't need to just live, I need to live to fight. -I understand how you feel. -So-- I want to know. I want you to tell me. What chance do I have to recover? -You're doing so much better than the usual patient with a cervical cord injury. But it's just impossible to give you a forthright answer. After all, if the cord's been severed or severely damaged at the movement of impact, your chance to recover would be very slight. On the other hand, if the cord was only slightly shaken up-- -Will I ever ride a horse again? -No. -I see. The best I have to hope for is semi-invalidism. Invalidism? -General-- -Thank you, Colonel, for your honesty. I prize that in a man. -Ladies and gentlemen. If you care to follow me into the conference room. REPORTER: About time. REPORTER: Let's go. -May we have it quiet, please? Thank you. As you know, this conference is being held in lieu of the regular bulletin usually given at 6:00 p.m. -Sorry I'm late. -This press interview is a major concession for the media, since we as doctors are essentially violating the sanctity of the position and patient relations. And due to this fact, we may decline to answer those questions which we deem improper. I'd like to introduce Colonel Glen Sperling. Colonel Sperling has served throughout the war as a chief neurosurgical consultant in Europe. And most of you are familiar with Major Kenneth Morgan, our public relations officer. REPORTER: Yeah, we sure are. -I'm Lieutenant Colonel Paul Hill. I guess we can begin. REPORTER: What color pajamas does the General wear? And are they his own or government issue? -Government issue. REPORTER: Colonel, over here please. -I'd like to know if the General takes orange juice or grapefruit juice with his breakfast. -Orange juice. REPORTER: Colonel. -Is he using much profanity in the hospital? And could you give us some examples? -No, I couldn't. REPORTER: Sir, can we ask, what of his nurses is his favorite? -I believe he has no favorites. -Does the general have a paralyzed face? -Madam, please. Thank you. BEATRICE PATTON (VOICEOVER): Dear Ruth Ellen. I'm in my little room at the hospital, directly down the hall from your father's. I spend most of each day with him, reading aloud from the books he's loved through the years. It helps to take his mind off the present situation, and it helps me too. BEATRICE PATTON: "This willful and resonant man, clanvoyant and egotistical, had flirted with destiny and frequently seduced fate. Now his long pursuit was yielding its supreme reward. He was passing into history." BEATRICE PATTON (VOICEOVER): He knows how worried I am, whether I show it or not. And he tries to calm my fears. Good He's always said that I knew what was best for him. I wish to God I did now. He's in the hands of others, strangers to me. BEATRICE PATTON: "Thought there were no more worlds to conquer at the age of 33. Wellington was 44 at Waterloo, while Napoleon and Hannibal were burned out by the time they were 40. All I can BEATRICE PATTON (VOICEOVER): All I can do is watch helplessly as they keep him occupied with myriad discomforting chores. BEATRICE PATTON: "Shouting at the top of his voice. Attack, you miserable cowards. What are you waiting for? You can't live forever." BEATRICE PATTON (VOICEOVER): But we will ride out the storm together. BEATRICE PATTON: "He spared neither pain, care, nor trouble to arrive at his end. And this applied as much to little things as to great. He was, one might say, totally given over to his object. He always applied all his needs, all his faculties, all this attentions to the action or discussion of the moment." -Thank you, Bertha. -Did I get everything? -Yes. You see, Colonel, Napoleon was a man completely wrapped in his own destiny. A supreme egotist and an isolated, self-centered man who relied on himself alone. Go-- go ahead, Bea. BEATRICE PATTON: "Into everything he put passion, hence the enormous advantage he had over his adversaries. For few people are entirely absorbed by one thought, or one action, or one moment." -What a prophet he was. He said there would be no independence or liberty without great armies. And look what has happened to what was, the greatest Army in history. Just six months ago, the American Army is being disbanded (COUGHING) -All right, Georgie it's time to stop. You'll tire yourself out. You're supposed to listen, not-- [WHEEZING] -I've just given him a mild sedative. Don't worry, he'll be all right now. -Thank you, Colonel. COLONEL SPERLING: And I'll be right down the hall. Just go easy on the talking, huh? -Yes, I will. -It provokes the congestion. Now, you behave yourself. We'll get you into a neck and shoulder cast. And we'll get rid of these hooks, OK? Good night, Mrs. Patton. BEATRICE PATTON: Good night, Colonel. -You've always been at your best when the chips were down. -Shh, now you heard what he said. -How long has it been? How many years? -You know, 35. -35. You put up with a lot from me, Bea. Any other woman would have left me a long time ago. -I'm not any other woman. -No, that's right. You're not. You've always been the most important person to me. There is no one else. -Georgie, you don't have to say anything. -The mark of gentility. Sweetheart, so much of your life has been spent waiting. -Georgie, do you remember when you landed in Africa? I can't describe my feelings when the news came over the radio that you had made your landing successfully. That you had done exactly what you wanted to do. And I thought, this man is his own star. He commands all light, all influence, all fate. And I knew there'd be months, maybe years of waiting anxiety ahead of me. And yet, all I could think of was your triumph. That the first jump was taken. That you'd never have to take it again. And I told myself, God is with us. He'll always be with us. And the thought that you loved me rang through my mind like a peal of bells. You loved me. BEATRICE PATTON: "As a youth, T.E. Lawrence thought nothing of reading half through the night, lying on a rug or mattress, a habit that had the convenience of allowing him to sleep where he lay." GENERAL PATTON: Exactly what did at Lake Vineyard as a boy. Just like Lawrence of Arabia. BEATRICE PATTON: "By habit too, he developed"-- [COUGHING] -He's all right. -That's enough for now anyway. -You did a fine job on the collar. -Is he eating his porridge like a good bear, Lieutenant. -No, but you're right about the bear part, Colonel. -A man must eat, General. -A man must eat, though every tree were a gallows. -There he goes again, talking like that. Shame on you. [WHEEZING] -Will this never end? DOCTOR: Hang on, General. -I'm so tired of just hanging on. -I found this at the Pietz. -Why not? Doctor's orders. We'll add it to your regular medication. -But only one teaspoon when your condition calls for it. We'd better keep this between us, huh? -You tell the girls. -Good. Let's all have a drink. For the medal of honor I never got. And from now on, I make you my official bartender. -Lieutenant. -Yes, sir. -Lieutenant Hogen has been detained in the lab. She asked if you'd check her ward for her. -Oh, sure. I'll do it right now. -All right. Thank you. -Do you men know what time it is? -Where's old Swivelhips Hodecker? -She's been detailed in the-- -Hey Nursy, wanna dance? -Very funny. Now get into bed, all of you. Or I'll sick Nurse Hodecker. -Say nurse, how's General Patton doing? -How is the old man. You're his nurse, aren't you? -He's doing just fine. -How are his spirits? Is he OK? -Well-- -Yeah, I bet he's a real colorful character, ey? -Oh, he's colorful all right. He won't take any nourishment now, unless he gets some whiskey first. -Whisky. NURSE: That's right. -What do you know? -Flat on his back. Those awful hooks, and all. And still he-- no, that's enough. -Do you think he'll ever walk again? -I said, that's enough. No more questions. Everybody turn in. And if you don't keep that radio off I'll have Nurse Hodecker sit on it. -Lieutenant, good evening. -Lieutenant Hodecker. -The great Whisky Rebellion. Poor Bertha. Don't be too hard on her. -And you don't mind? -It's good for my reputation. Besides, I can use all the laughs I can get. -Well, good. No harm then. I'll drop by later. You comfortable? -I'm OK. I don't suffer, my friends. But I do feel a certain difficulty in existing. -You awake? -Is that you, Hep? -Well, Georgie, I-- I hear you're improving. -Where'd you hear that? I'll tell you, there's a lot of lucky pheasants running around because of the fix I'm in. -Yeah. I-- I have something to read to you. -Yes? -Mm-hm. It's a letter from Ike. -Forget it. -Whatever you say. -I don't want to hear it. OK, go ahead and read it. -Dear George. You can imagine what a shock it was to me to hear of your serious accident. At first I heard it on the basis of rumor and simply did not believe, thinking it only a story. I immediately wired Frankfurt and learn to my great distress that it was true. The real purpose of this note is simply to assure you that you will always have a job, and not to worry about this accident closing out any of them for your selection. It is always difficult for me to express my true sentiments when I am deeply moved. You are never out of my thoughts. And my hopes and prayers are tied up in your speedy recovery. With warm personal regards, Ike. -All those years down the train. What went wrong between us? Hep? -Yeah. -Where'd you ever get the first name Hobart? I'll be seeing you soon. -OK, George. [KNOCK AT DOOR] -Yeah, come in. -You're looking for me? MAN: Yeah, we have a problem. -What? -Washington does not want General Patton to die on German soil. So we must prepare him for shipment back to the United States immediately. -That's impossible. -That's Washington. -Even if Patton were out of danger, which he isn't, he shouldn't be moved for at least another six weeks. Mobilization of plaster casts leads to embolism. -There must be some political benefit in having him die back home. What about all his soldiers who were buried in Germany? Wouldn't they want to be with him? -Patton would. Why? I don't get it. -Well General, it looks like you'll be home for Christmas. -I'm looking forward to it. Even in this cement overcoat. -Looks good, Bill. -Thanks. -I'll make good ballast. -Yes sir, that's for sure. -Just don't roll me down the hill. -We wouldn't do that. [KNOCK AT DOOR] BEATRICE PATTON: Come in. HOBART GAY: Hello, Bea. BEATRICE PATTON: Hello, Hep. HOBART GAY: I-- I just thought I'd check up on you. Are you holding up? -I guess so. Georgie's fooled everyone with his stamina and charm. All except Colonel Hill. I think he knows. HOBART GAY: Knows what? -That Georgie's slipping away. A little more each day. I can see it behind the bluff and bravado. -Don't say that. BEATRICE PATTON: There's something in the air. Something mysterious, like enchantment or the miracle of birth. Don't you feel it? I wish to God transitions weren't so painful. Parting, we're all fated to part. Why should it seem so sad melting into memory? Anyway, I don't believe death is the end. I think we come back again and again until we learn whatever it is we're meant to learn. Otherwise this existence would seem so pointless. Georgie is an ancient man. He'll be back as long as the world needs a warrior's soul. HOBART GAY: Bea. -All these years I've had to be the hard-fisted tough military wife, facing every crisis like a soldier without emotion. But all the while, in here, I tremble for him. I'll see this through. I won't break. They're flying him to Boston before Christmas. -I know. Is that wise? -It's what he wants. It's what I want. REPORTER: It's been 10 days since General George S. Patton met with a freak highway accident South of Frankfurt. Even with a broken neck, Old Blood and Guts is apparently back in command, loudly demanding an occasional snort of whiskey from his pretty nurses. Word from inside sources is that Patton is now sitting up in bed and will soon be walking. Good luck to you, General, from all of us. This is the voice of Uncle Sam in Germany. Sam-- MAN: Fools. -Hello, George. -Mm. Hello. Bea and I are very happy that you're going to take us home. How do I look? -You look fine, George. Just fine. -You always were a lousy liar. DOCTOR: How's respiration? BERTHA: Erratic. DOCTOR: It's that embolism I was afraid of. We can't make an aortic examination because of that cast. -But you're telling me that it's the beginning of the end. -You told us to level with you. -Oh yes, I remember. How brave I was from a safe distance. You said there were new x-rays. -Yes, this morning. -And? -There's an embolism in the upper right lung. We don't know where it came from. DOCTOR: We've prescribed digitalis, saline drip, protein. -What is the matter with us? Why can't we let him go? [SINGING - LET IT SNOW] -Were you dreaming? -I don't know. Something a long time ago, I think. BEATRICE PATTON: Dreams are illusive. -Catalina. -What? -My dream was Catalina. -Was I in it. -You? 'Course not. -I don't believe you. I was there. And it was 1902. And you were a gangly boy, beanpole. And I was a tomboy. And we road together all over that island. And before the summer was out, we had our understanding. -How did you you know my dream? That's exactly what it was. -I was 15 then. I still played the dolls. -I was a child and she was a child in this kingdom by the sea. -But we loved with a love that was more than love. -Beatrice? -Georgie. Georgie, you had two beautiful horses. Do you remember? An all the boys, they envied you so. -Yes. My father gave them to me. -Yes. -The black I named Galahad. And the brown was Marmie. -Marmie was such a fine horse. And what a beautiful heart. -I had a dog named Palvo who slept in Marmie's stall. I remember one night going down to the stable when I was supposed to be studying and lying in the straw beside Palvo, and looking up at Marmie, and thinking I must be the luckiest boy in the world. -Georgie. You come back here. -It's too dark. I mean, too late. [KNOCK AT DOOR] -Come in. -Bea, Sperling and I are going over to the Officer's Mess for dinner. Why don't you come along? -No, I should stay here. -You've got to eat something. Come on. Georgie's fast asleep. See? Look at him. He'll be all right. -Well, all right. BERTHA: Do you speak English? MAN: Yah. BERTHA: We ask that you please remain on this floor only. No scuffling, no unnecessary conversations, and only 20 minutes tonight. We appreciate your coming. Everyone's been looking forward to it. [CHILDREN SINGING CAROLS] [SINGING - SILENT NIGHT] -Papa. [CHILDREN SINGING CAROLS] NARRATOR: To learn more about General George S.
