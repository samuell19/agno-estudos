Did you ever see the faces Of the children? They get so excited Waking up on Christmas morning Hours before The winter's sun's ignited They believe in dreams And all they mean Including heaven's generosity Peeping 'round the door to see What parcels are for free In curiosity And Tommy doesn't know What day it is He doesn't know who Jesus was Or what praying is How can he be saved From the eternal grave?

Surrounded by his friends He sits so silently And unaware of anything Crazy-eyed he picks his nose He smiles, he cries He pokes his tongue at everything I believe in love But how can men who've never Seen light be enlightened? Only if he's cured Will his spirit's future level Ever heighten And Tommy doesn't know What day it is He doesn't know who Jesus was Or what praying is How can he be saved From the eternal grave?
