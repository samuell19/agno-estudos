Then, by the power vested in me by the Civil Code and the mayor of Buca, I hereby pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. You bastard! Animal. Freaking animal! Asshole! Bastard! Why me, God? Why me? Excuse me? I'm sorry. I realize you're angry, and this is not a good time, but there's no toilet paper here. Can you pass me some, please? I'm sorry, but this is the bride's restroom. -I think you're in the wrong place. -I'm the bride from the other hall. Are you a bride too? Yeah… Yes! Well, congratulations! Thank you. Isn't there a restroom in your hall? It's out of order. The organizer told us to use here. -Welcome, I guess. -Thanks. Are you okay? Why did you ask? I mean, you were just calling someone names. Maybe I can help you out or something. You know, bride to bride! No, it's okay. Everything's fine. I can handle it on my own, but thanks. All right then. -I'm sorry. -I'm sorry for you too. -What did you say? -I said congratulations to you too. Thank you so much. So, is there any toilet paper there? I asked for some, remember? I told you there isn't any. -All right. I'll… Hang on. -Okay. -There it is. -Thanks. I found it. Fuck my luck! Would it kill her to just pass it to me? Why throw it at my head? For God's sake. Why are people like this? Stop sulking. Come on, smile. No, Hayko. No, listen. You know how you said you'll handle it? I took that as a promise and told my in-laws that you were coming. Yeah. What? A meeting? What meeting? Come on, man. Don't embarrass me in front of my in-laws. I told them you were coming, man. Look… I'm on the phone. Can't you just spare us an hour? How about half an hour? How about ten minutes? How about you just say hi? Be here as soon as the meeting ends. I love you, man. Lots of love, Hayko. Love you. Cemil, what celebrity are you pestering this time? I'm not pestering him, Züleyha. They're all my acquaintances, friends, comrades. Hayko Cepkin wanted to come. So I invited him, and he said yes. I was checking up on him. What's the big deal? Don't these artists live in Istanbul? Is he even in Izmir? You don't know how they are. They always take advantage of Istanbul, and then they say, "We're tired of this crowded, noisy city. Let's move to Izmir." "There are flights. We can be in Istanbul in 45 minutes." I bet Hayko Cepkin has a place in Izmir as well. Come on, Cemil. All these people are here for our son's wedding. Don't they count? It's not like we need a celebrity. You just want to boast. You're embarrassing us in front of our in-laws. Shame on you, Züleyha. Why would I boast? Look. I know you're just jealous. Why would I be jealous? I just hope you come to your senses. What else is there to say? I swear you're jealous of me. LOTS OF LOVE FROM EGE TV & RADIO I bet you a thousand bucks he sent those flowers himself. Say we buy the flowers story, he kept talking about how he's going to bring tons of celebrities to his son's wedding. -What is he going to do now? -Don't be ridiculous, Muazzez. Who would come to his son's wedding? Didn't they fire him because he would pester the celebrities at the network? He told people he was friends with every celebrity who said hi to him. -The fool was just a lowly security guard. -Exactly. He should've known his place. Shame on him. Tell me about it. We're way out of their league, but we have to shut up for the sake of Buse. JOY WEDDING HALL HALL 1 - HALL 2 Come on, people. Get up and dance. Get over here. What's wrong, my beautiful mother? I love you. Where's the bride, son? The bride is on her horse galloping away. You keep laughing like a horse, but the band is about to invite you two to dance, and the bride is not here. She must've gone to the restroom. She'll be here soon. Oh my God. Don't tell me you're drinking. Come on, Mom. Of course not. See? She's here. Ladies and gentlemen, with a round of applause, we invite the bride and groom to the stage. Thanks for the applause. For those not clapping, I hope your mother-in-law dies. Would my lovely wife like to dance with me? Of course. You're so cute, girls! Honey, where were you? You've been gone for half an hour. Push it. I just went out for a smoke and to get some air. When are you going to stop taking that poison? I wish I could. -What? -I said I'll quit slowly. I can't do it cold turkey. You can't quit anything that way, Serkan. You just have to make up your mind and quit cold turkey. I won't let you smoke in the house. You know that! Serkan, you know what I saw? I saw the bride from the hall next door in the restroom. You know, she was crying. How horrible. No. How would I know that? I was minding my business. She burst into the restroom. She didn't see me. She kept swearing at someone. She was like, "You animal! You bastard!" I just froze. I asked her nicely if I could help her with anything. Okay. What did she say? She asked me if there's no restroom in our hall. I told her it was out of order, and that's why I was there. -What did she say? -She said, "Welcome." I was baffled. She must be crazy. No normal person would say that. Who knows what happened, right? I don't care. I'll just go chat with Oğuz. I bet he's with the girls! The guy calls them sons of bitches, and Temel says, "Dursun, run! They recognized me!" You know, since he's actually an SOB. Oğuz? Let's talk for a second. Wait for me. I have more jokes to come. Serkan, what's wrong? -Hülya's here. -Hülya who? You're kidding. -How can she be here? Who invited her? -She's getting married next door. What? Her wedding is next door? -Are you happy? -It's nice. -Is it now? -It is. I mean, of course I'm happy. I'm happy too. You were so hard to get, but I just knew this would happen someday. -Doesn't it feel like it's a dream? -Tell me about it. We're going to be so happy. HÜLYA & TARIK WELCOME -Congratulations. -Welcome. Have a seat. Welcome, man. See? He came. -Welcome. -Thanks. Congratulations. Thank you so much, Davut. Welcome again. Where did you see her? What happened? Tell me the whole story. I was just getting some air. Come on, dance! Hülya? Serkan? I guess life is full of surprises… and bastards. Is this a prank? If it is, the timing is horrible. The wedding next door… Are you getting married? No, Serkan. I just went insane. I wear gowns and crash random weddings. What are you doing here? Should I have waited forever? I'm getting married too. Good for you. I guess you finally found your balls. Hülya, I never cheated on you. PROFILO WELCOME TO OUR VENDORS' MEETING -Hello? -Hi, Serkan. What are you doing, honey? Are you still up, honey? I was about to go to sleep, but… What are you doing? Is the party over? Almost. We're exhausted, Hülya. We woke up at 10 a.m., we clapped our hands for some dishwashers and fridges, then we tied our ties to our heads and have been dancing ever since. This is my first vendors' meeting, so I'm playing it by ear. When is your flight? Takeoff is at 10:45 a.m. Don't stay up late then. Go get some sleep. Yeah, I'm about to leave anyway. All right. Missed anyone? -Missed whom? -Your uncle. No. Why would I miss my uncle? Oh my God. Stop joking around, Serkan. I meant me, of course. Why bring my uncle into this? You should've just asked. Of course I miss you. We've never been apart until now, and I've been here for three days. Consider it a vacation then. Look on the bright side. -I guess. -Just come back already. We must plan our wedding. My parents won't stop talking about it. I want it to happen soon too. We'll organize it as soon as I'm back. I'll make you my wife. You may be an idiot, but you're my idiot. I love you. -I love you too. -See you. -Excuse me. -Yes? -May I have a glass of water? -Right away, sir. Oh, come on. He looks so cute and silly. -Thanks. -You're welcome. Hello. I'm the Tepecik vendor. Cansu. Hi, the vendor of Tepecik. Aren't you Serkan, the Gültepe vendor? Yeah, Gültepe is mine. -Nice to meet you. -You too. So? Aren't you going to buy me a coffee? I'm tired. I was just about to head off. I have an early flight. Can't you spare me ten minutes of your time? I see. Your girlfriend would be angry. I wish your dad were angrier with you when you were little, but… Unfortunately, when I was old enough to be berated, I had no father to berate me. -He passed away when I was a baby. -I see. I'm so sorry. -How do you take your coffee? -No sugar. All right. Hey, waiter! Can we have two cups of coffee? No sugar. -Again, I'm so sorry. -It's okay. You couldn't have known. -Should we go over there? -Of course. After you. What? Serkan! That day you cheated on not just me, but on us, Serkan. -That's what she said. Then she left. -You can't be serious, man. -Are you taking the piss out of me? -When I saw her there in a gown, I felt like I was dying. I've always dreamed of seeing her in a gown, and there she was. I couldn't resist. What did you just say? Do you realize you're at your wedding? Plus, you cheated on her, man. I didn't, man. I didn't! How many times do I have to tell you? I fell asleep in the lounge chair. I didn't even know who was with me at that point. I didn't cheat! Dude, didn't you just cheat on your brand-new wife with your ex? -It's not the same thing! -It is! Also, that vendor had photos. Why are you still denying it? If I could find that girl, Cansu, I would've shoved that photo up her-- -Just shut up, man. -For God's sake. Don't feed me lies. So? -What are you going to do? -I don't know, Oğuz. It's like a third-division team's journey to the tournament final. I'll keep going till I can't. You're already eliminated. Just accept defeat. Look. How many years has it been? Fate has brought him to you at your wedding, dressed as a groom. -Someone else's groom though. -You're someone else's bride too. Just saying. Before it's too late, you could-- Come on, Nermin! Serkan has done enough damage. It's out of the question. Also, Tarık doesn't deserve that. Come on. He's always been so nice to me. He did everything I asked. No way. He loves me so much. What about you? Oh, Nermin. I gave up on love a long time ago. -Why did you two kiss then? -We didn't! He kissed me against my will! That bastard. Hülya, I know you. Your eyes sparkle when you talk about Serkan. You haven't moved on. This is a sign. Who's the bride? I couldn't ask him who and what his wife was. I'm so sorry. I hope no one saw us. It'd be the end of me. Osman? Is something wrong? Were you going to say something? Osman, why aren't you speaking? I swear he saw it. That kid saw us! I'm certain. You see? I'm going to have a heart attack at my wedding. We're screwed. Hang on. I have to call Serkan. Damn it! I left my phone at the table. I hope he didn't change his number. You see? You should never question the things that happen to you in life. See, if I hadn't put out that financial disclosure and got incarcerated, I would've never met Davut. I love you so much, Formatter Davut. The feeling is mutual, Kenan. Why do they call you "Formatter Davut?" Are you into computers? When we were in prison, he hit an officer so hard that the guy had short-term memory loss. Of course, it wasn't what I intended to do. I mean, he may have unintentionally claimed some lives, but that doesn't make him a killer. Real killers do it intentionally, from the heart. Sure. There are so many killers who wouldn't hurt a fly, right? Excuse me. Can you not say "killer," Mr. Yaşar? You may say "destined to take lives." Hülya, let's say hi to Davut. -Welcome, Davut. -Thanks, son. Congratulations, honey. I hope you two lead a happy life. Thanks. Welcome, ma'am. Thanks. -Congratulations. -Thank you. Come on, people! Come on, Dad, no way! Serkan! I'm telling him, Dad. -I have a surprise for you. -You do? Dad said he'd rent an apartment in Alsancak after the wedding. -Are you ready for the real surprise? -I am. He told me he'd make you manager of the Alsancak outlet. I love you, Dad! You're the best! Honey, aren't you excited? Say something! What a nice surprise, right? Are you crazy? That's excellent news! I'm going to manage fridges and vacuums in Alsancak! Serkan, that girl just won't stop dancing. But I'd be just like her if I was that fat too. Honey, she's your relative, right? She must be. Buse, come on! We're going to take photos. Hang on! -Come on. -Hang on a second! Be careful. -All right. -Come on. Are we ready? Three, two… It's your turn now! Let's create a hashtag for this. Everyone should see it. -Take another one, with Serkan behind me. -Okay. HÜLYA: I THINK TARIK'S BROTHER OSMAN SAW US IN THE BACKYARD. SERKAN: WHO'S OSMAN? HÜLYA: THE KID FROM THE TV SHOW! SERKAN: WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? HÜLYA: CLEAN UP YOUR MESS! SERKAN: "CLEAN UP"? I CAN'T KILL ANYONE! HÜLYA: DON'T BE RIDICULOUS. DON'T KILL HIM. JUST HANDLE IT! HÜLYA: HANDLE IT BEFORE THE KID TELLS ON US! Dude, I'm not saying we'll kidnap him and sell his kidneys. We're not the mafia! Let's just lock him up until this is over so there's no scene. -This is our only option. -I won't abduct a kid. We're not going to harm him. Dude, this is serious. Look. If anyone hears of this, it'll be the end of us. Why should I care? It has nothing to do with me, Serkan. Aren't you my best man? That doesn't entail kidnapping someone. Do I look like an idiot? It does. This is what a best man is for! He's just a kid! Now we invite the bride, her relatives and her friends to the stage. Let's hear it for the bride! Nermin. Come on, girls. TARIK: DOES THE SUIT GOOD LOOK ON ME? TARIK: AREN'T YOU GOING TO ANSWER, MÜJDAT? MÜJDE: "MÜJDAT"? DID YOU SAVE ME AS "MÜJDAT"? MÜJDE: STOP TEXTING ME, TARIK! DAVUT WILL KILL US IF HE FINDS OUT! What's wrong with her? Nothing. She's fine. Hülya! -Is everything okay, honey? -It is, Mom. Everything's fine. Then why do you look like you're at a funeral and not your wedding? -Where did you get that idea, Mom? -You're sulking, honey. I'm your mother. I can tell when something's bothering you. Why would anything bother me, Mom? I'm just tired. I've been running around all day. That's why. Hülya, you're not regretting this, right? Mom, come on! Why would I be? I'm just tired. All right, honey. Then what do we do? We smile. Come on now, dance. LADIES' ROOM I asked you a question. Why don't you answer me, baby? Tarık, you're drunk. You don't know what you're doing. -Someone's going to see. Come on. -Look at me. Should I have gotten married to you instead of Hülya? I'd ask for Davut's blessing, even. He's old enough to be your father. Our relationship was a mistake, and it's over. Move on. I have. Also, you just got married. Are you seriously hitting on me right now? I'm not hitting on you. I'm kissing you. You reek of alcohol. As if you're kissing Kıvanç Tatlıtuğ every morning. You're kissing Davut the contractor. You're with him for his money. So, what's with the attitude? For God's sake. Asshole! -Where have you been, baby? -I was just freshening up. For whom are you putting on makeup, honey? I liked you, so I put a ring on you. So, your shop is out of business. I've built a skyscraper on top of it! You're my man. And you're my lady. Hi. I'm Nermin, Hülya's maid of honor. I suppose you're looking for Osman, but he's not here. No, I was looking at you. Me? What gives? If I were you, I'd always look at myself in the mirror. I can look at you all day if you have no one who does. Fine, go ahead. Let me just find the brat, then I'll come and look at you. What's this? "I bought you a phone." You don't remember the TV show? Give me your number so we can be in touch. I'll come back. -See you. -See you. Hey, you. Look at me. Where have you been sneaking off to, Tarık? Son, the gift ceremony is about to start. Are you drinking? You know I've quit, Mom. Stop pestering me about it! -Let me smell your breath. -Mom, this is not the place. Son, you know what happens to you when you drink, right? Tarık, son, you don't want to ruin your wedding, right? Dear guests, the gift ceremony is about to start. I repeat, the gift ceremony is about to start. Thanks, Uncle. Dear guests, please just give your gift and move on. Don't idle around. Dear guests, don't idle around. Look, the queue is getting bigger. The latest gift was a bracelet from the bride's uncle… My relatives are showering me with gold. Yours are just giving 50 or 100 liras. Buse, shame on you. How can you think that? Honey, I'm kidding. You have such a short fuse. -Excuse me? -Oh, my grandpa… He's the best. Look at it. Some people are more giving. -Wow. -Let's hide the bills. I cannot believe my eyes. Dear guests, are you ready? From the bride's parents, two golden bracelets for the bride. Is it over? Of course not. On top of those, a top-of-the line Profilo XXL refrigerator, a high-capacity washing machine, a dishwasher with six different programs… Is it over? No. An oven, and a high-quality vacuum. Every appliance is energy-efficient. -Is it over? No. -No. A hairdryer, a blender, a food processor, a mixer, and last but not least, a Full HD 4K television. So, the bride's father has put on quite a show. -A round of applause! -You're spoiling me. Thanks! What a great father he is! He bought everything for us. Buse, I feel like we're on Wheel of Fortune. There's excitement in the air! Now, it is the turn of the groom's father, Mr. Cemil! -From him, we have… -Mr. Erhan! Please don't build anticipation. I'm gifting her seven grams of gold. From Mr. Cemil to the bride, seven grams of gold. Just seven grams? Is that all? No, of course not. Tonight, I invited a famous musician friend of mine who's very dear to me. He'll be here any minute, and he's going to sing whatever song you request! -Dad-- -Where's my applause? Dad, you shouldn't have. What if no one comes? Why did you do that? What was I supposed to do, son? I had to match his gifts. That ill-mannered father-in-law of yours gave you an entire set of appliances. How could I have just gifted you a small piece of gold? -Congratulations. -Thank you. -Congratulations, honey. -Thank you. So, you guys, travel around when you can, but have a baby before long, so we can play with it. Well, you're old enough to play with your grandkids. Sir. -Davut, get over here. -My man. -I'm so happy you're here. -Thanks. You moron. Your brother saw us. You moron. Damn it, Tarık! You're drunk! Don't let your in-laws or Hülya find out, and stop drinking! What about Osman? -What about him? -He's nowhere to be found. You could've looked after him instead of drinking. I bet he's playing with the kids. Don't worry. -What's up? -Find me Osman. Hurry. All right. Thank you. -Hey, kids. Is Osman around? -No, he's not. Where the hell is he? Come on! Dance, honey! Dance! -Mr. Groom? -Yeah, kid? -Someone needs to talk to you. -I'm coming. Ayten, he sneaked off again. He's hiding something. I can't help but wonder. I'm going to go find out. Hang on. I'm coming too. I'm his aunt after all. Hey, man. You wanted to talk? I have some bad news for you. What do you mean? Let me show you. Fuck. Exactly. It looks like you had a bridal mix-up, bro. I mean, it's not my business. No one needs to be upset on your happiest day, right? -What do you want? -I don't want any trouble. -How much would that cost? -Half of the gold you got. You can keep the appliances. Are you insane, man? How can I give you half of the gold when half of it belongs to my wife? How would I explain it? How would you explain this? This is a crime, you know. You're blackmailing me. Come on. You were the one who's cheating. Not that it's any of my business. I'll give you some time to think. The wedding is not over yet. Al right? I'll be around. We'll talk later. See you. WELCOME TO OUR WEDDING BUSE & SERKAN Hello, Oğuz? Where are you, man? Come to the office. Hurry up. Serkan, I can't find the brat anywhere. It's like he vanished. Oğuz, we have bigger problems than Osman. We've had enough action for one night, man. Please don't stress me out any more. The photographer is blackmailing me. He took photos of me and Hülya kissing. You can't be serious! Serkan, only God can help us now. He could if the photos weren't in Full HD. He wants half the gold. Give it to him then! Do I have to do that too? Don't be ridiculous. It's not all mine. What would I tell Buse? And how can I be sure he won't ask for more? I'm screwed, man. I should get back. They'll get suspicious. Hang on, man. We're screwed. I swear we're screwed. Hülya, the kid is nowhere to be found! I called Oğuz. He couldn't find him either. I've looked everywhere. Nermin, just find the damn kid! HÜLYA: SERKAN, FIND THAT KID! HURRY UP. I'M GETTING SCARED. SERKAN: FORGET THE KID. THE PHOTOGRAPHER HAS PHOTOS OF US. What is it? -We're screwed! -We're screwed! -Hey, man. Have you seen a kid here? -No, I haven't. All right. Let's look over there. Where the hell is he? Son, do you have a second? I forgot my purse in the bridal room. My antibiotics are in there. I have to take them now. -Can you help me up? -Sure thing, ma'am. I'm out of breath. We're here. We made it. Getting old is hard, son. Come on, help me out. -You'll know when you're old. -I understand, ma'am. Come on! Is there a problem, officer? We had a report about a kid thrown into the pond. What? -Ask if there's a missing kid. -All right. Dear guests, the officers are here for a missing kid. Can you please all check up on your children? Ayten, what did you do? I hit him with the log when he walked in! -We're screwed, Ayten. -We're screwed. Is he dead? Please, God, I don't want to rot in prison till I die. My fate is in your hands. Get a hold of yourself! This is no time to panic! We have to figure something out. Don't drag me into this, Ayten. You killed him, you bury him. I'll plead guilty and hope for the best. We don't even know if he's dead. Don't be ridiculous! Hang on. Is he dead? I can't look at a corpse. How would I know, Züleyha? Do I look like a doctor? Ayten, what if we get the death penalty? A stool, a rope, and… bam! -All kids are accounted for. -We'll check the other hall. All right. We'll call you if we hear something. -Make sure you do. -All right. Congratulations. Let's go. What are we waiting for? Let's continue! Here we go, people. -Let's dance! -Dance! He's not in the yard either. Where the hell is he? INCOMING CALL SERKAN You know… how is that I've never seen you before, since you're so close with Hülya she made you her maid of honor? I was abroad during their relationship. I visited once or twice, but I guess we never crossed paths. I see. Are you from abroad? Yes. I grew up in Germany. I was there for four years after high school. -You were a lucky kid. -Kind of. I speak three languages and can play an instrument. -How did you spend your childhood? -By showing old people my willy. I didn't have time to hold a pen. My hands were full with the penis. I only speak one language. I like you, but let's not get too intimate. I like you too. If you keep smiling like that, I'm going to go get our wedding invitations printed. Slow down or you'll get tired. I won't chase anyone anyway. If I did, I'd be playing for Barcelona. -I didn't get the joke. -You will. There'll be a day we bet on a game together. SERKAN: DID YOU THROW THE KID INTO THE POND? Son, I can't find your mother. Have you seen her? I haven't, Dad. What's wrong with you? You look pale. It's my first wedding, Dad. It's only normal. -I'll be better at the second one. -I was just like you at our wedding. I was asking God, "What have I dragged myself into?" I was so nervous. But after I got to know your mom better, after I saw how pure her heart was, after I witnessed how kind and generous she was, I fell in love with her. Yeah, Mom's cool. -Oh, God. Ayten… -Come on. My back's broken. -Sis, come on! -Dear God… I swear my back broke. Get the door. -Hang on. -Thanks. Come on. Oh God. I hope no one saw us. I can't believe we've become murderers at our age. -Don't talk like that. -Let's go. My back… Come on. Let's go. This is the guy who kidnapped me! -Hello, officer. -Good evening, sir. -What's up? -A kid has been thrown into the pond. -Ask around if there's a missing kid. -Announce it, son. Dear guests, are all your kids accounted for? Please check up on them. Any last words, Osman? -Slut. -Slut? Goodbye, Osman! May you rest in peace, honey! Dear guests, I repeat, are all your children accounted for? Report immediately if your kid is missing. You killed my brother! Murderer! -I guess everyone's okay. -Yeah. All right, we're leaving. Call us if you hear anything. -Would you like a soda, officer? -Thanks. We don't drink on duty. -Even soda? -Yes, even soda. Congratulations. To you as well. Let's go, guys. Well, there's nothing for us to do other than keep having fun. Here we go. Osman! Hey, you! Wake up, man. What's up? Why are you here? Thank God you're here, man. I'm the photographer. Someone stole my camera and locked me in here. -The bastard ran away. -I'm glad you're okay then. -Need us to call the police? -No need. I almost remember his face. I'll handle it. All right. Listen. We're looking for a little kid. Have you seen him? -A kid? -Yeah, a kid. -There's a missing kid? -Yes. It always happens at weddings. I'm sure you'll find him. All right, man. Take care. -See you. -Thanks, guys. Thanks… I swear I put him in here. Who took him away? Fuck. Mom, why did you do that? I was going to handle it. Shut up! It's all your fault! You cheated on her, so God punished you by making you see her at your wedding. I didn't cheat on her, Mom! -Where's the gear? -What gear? Hunting gear! The camera, Mom! -I didn't see any cameras. -Oh, I did. When I hit him with the log, he had it in his hand. He dropped it on the floor. Way to go, Auntie. So, you just left the camera there? We're not thieves, son. Why would we take it? You are murderers though. Why did you hit him with a log? To protect you! To avoid a scene. And you're blaming us? Mom, the photos were in it! Ayten, I can't just sit here. We have to do something. Let's go grab the guy and put him someplace safer. Or even better, let's bury him. Sis, I'm coming too. Wait. I'm so sorry, man. Stay here! I'm so sick of getting kidnapped! What even happened? Those ladies were morons, I guess. Everything's still here. Nice. -Listen, Ayten. -Yeah? I can't dig a hole and bury him. -You do it. -It's them again. Get the door. See? We can't even look after a corpse Look at what you dragged us into. Where is he? Did he come back from the dead? Come on. God… We can't find Osman anywhere. Is that so? Have you checked the pond? Maybe his body has washed ashore by now. What are you saying, man? What body? I hope my brother's not dead. Tarık, how much did you drink? God damn it, Tarık. Enough, man. Two bottles? Seriously? What are you doing? Mind your own business! Just stop, man. Hang on. I'll order some coffee for you. Let's go, guys. Tarık, I've never seen you drink before. What's going on? I don't. I quit. What do you mean you don't? Look at you. You're wasted. I'm upset Hülya! That murderer killed my brother. Killed your brother? -Who? -Stay out of it, Hülya! This is a familial matter. Who though? Can you give me a name? I said stay out of it, Hülya! This is my business! Mine only! HÜLYA: NERMİN, I THINK OĞUZ KILLED OSMAN! HÜLYA: AND TARIK KNOWS! There you go, baby. I don't want it. Honey, we gave our gift. Let's leave already. Baby, this is like my own son's wedding. I can't do this to them. I know you're bored. It won't take too much longer, baby doll. I love you. Come on, hands in the air! I'm exhausted. Hey, Mom! Don't you think people gave us so few gifts? I mean, our side gave plenty. The groom's side kept giving us small bills and stuff. -They're poor! -What did you expect? You were the one that kept insisting that you'd marry the guard's son. The Gültepe vendor became my son-in-law! This is a joke. Of course they kept giving you small bills. I hope they won't steal their gifts back. Why are you being like this, Mom? I love Serkan! I've put so much effort into this relationship. I did everything for him! I'm telling you, he's the one! Can't you just accept that? Shut up, honey. Where did he go again? How would I know? Him and his mother keep disappearing. We're celebrating on our own here. I'm going to find him. You got married, yet you're still chasing men! -Shut up! -Why would I? You're embarrassing us. Where are the photos? How many photos did you take, you dick? Analog cameras were the best. The digital ones killed the art. How do I delete them? Where's the button? -What are you doing, honey? -Calling an ambulance. What? -Oh my God! Who is this? -The photographer. Why is he on the floor? Serkan, what's going on? I just randomly got in here and found him unconscious, Buse. Who did it though? And why? I bet it was someone from your side. My side would never do this, Serkan. Serkan, we can't find the photographer anywhere. We're screwed. Mom, is this the photographer you're looking for? God save me… -Mom! -Auntie, hold her. -This is not the time to faint, Züleyha. -I'm okay. -I'm not surprised though. -I didn't faint. I'm fine. Mom, why were you looking for him? Why wouldn't we, honey? How else are you going to show your wedding pictures to your children? Plus, we paid him for this, but he was nowhere to be found. INCOMING CALL HÜLYA Nothing. He's not answering. I can't bear the suspense anymore. I'm going. I'll go check up on Serkan. I hope they didn't kill Osman. Oğuz is not a murderer. He was just going to lock him up. Why is Tarık going on about his brother getting killed then? I don't know. Plus, he never drinks, but he got wasted at our wedding. Something's up for sure. I'm going. If someone asks, tell them I'm peeing. Fuck! I swear he's stuck to me like glue. -Hello, Cemil. -Hayko, what's up? You won't believe it, but I'm still at the meeting. It's not ending soon either. I think I won't be able to make it. Congratulate the kids for me. Come on, man! I'm going to be so embarrassed! I even introduced you at the gift ceremony! My in-laws are going to laugh behind my back. Damn it. Hayko, they love you so much around here. They started chanting as soon as they heard your name. "Hayko Cepken, Hayko Cepken!" Thank you so much. I'm really sorry. Tell everyone there I'm sorry. Well, if there's nothing you can do… I wish you even more success, brother! I love you. Take care! Thank you, Cemil. Congratulate them for me. Congratulations to you too. -Goodbye. -Good night, brother. You had to lay a guilt trip on me, didn't you? Levent, have you seen Serkan or his mother around? I haven't. Why? What's up? What do you mean what's up? How dare they do this? They keep running off and leaving us alone with the guests! You know what? I'm going to find them and tell them off. Enough is enough. Come on! This is unacceptable! Sir. Sir? Honey, this guy is not waking up. Let's call an ambulance, for God's sake. He may have brain damage. He may die! Take it back! Okay, I take it back. What is this? Do you want someone to die at our wedding? That'd be a horrible memory, Buse. What are we going to do? I'll call the ambulance. This is our wedding! Come on! For God's sake! This is no way to treat our guests. All right. I'll call the ambulance. OUTGOING CALL HÜLYA -Hello? -Hi, is this the ambulance? The ambulance? What are you talking about, Serkan? The photographer is unconscious. We found him lying on the floor. Who knocked him out? Where's the camera? Delete those photos, Serkan! Buse, my mom… Everyone's here! We're looking after him. Please send an ambulance. Give them the address! Why are you giving them my name? How can they send an ambulance without the address? I'm giving you the address. Joy Wedding Hall, the Buca Pond. Do you know the place? All right. We're waiting. Serkan, hang on! I have Osman. I caught him walking around. We're in the yard. Just get over here. All right, ma'am. We're waiting. Buse? Serkan? Mrs. Züleyha? Your son's wedding is downstairs, and you're just lying here! I fainted. Who the hell is this guy? Long story, Mrs. Muazzez. I'll tell you later. I randomly walked in here and found him unconscious. Then the others came. The ambulance is on its way. You best go back. Let's not keep the guests waiting. I'll hand him over to the medics. Give me the camera. I'll check out my photos with the girls. Come on, honey! We can't peek without his permission! What's the big deal, honey? We paid him anyway. I'm curious. Buse, honey, he might have private photos in it. -Maybe even naked photos. Come on. -For God's sake… Son, just give her the camera! It's her wedding, and she's the bride! She wants to look at the photos. I was going to give it to her afterwards, Mom. I'm "Mom" now? I was "Mrs. Muazzez" a minute ago. Just hand it over to your wife. We have to go back. Come on! You go ahead then. I'll hand him over to the medics and join you. Brother, you must be a gift from God! The photographer is unconscious. I called the ambulance. They'll be here soon. Just hand him over to them, okay? We have to tend to the guests. All right, brother. You go ahead. I'll handle it. Fuck being a best man! Why did you have to take those photos? Now I have to deal with you. -Where have you been? -Nowhere. We're here. CELLAR How does this work, honey? Just leave it alone. You'll break the guy's camera. I'm just going to have a look. -Come dance with us. -Hang on. -Come on! -Go dance, honey! Come on! HÜLYA: IF YOU DON'T COME HERE RIGHT NOW, I'LL KILL YOU! Where's he going again? I bet he's just going to the restroom. Look, Osman. I apologize for whatever happened to you. It was a lot. But if we cut you loose now, you'll just tell on us out of spite. I mean, I get it. I'd do the same thing if I were you. But I'm not you, and you're not me. Do you understand? What kind of people are you? What the hell is all this? I wasn't going to tell on you. I could've done it a million times if I wanted to. Why do you keep kidnapping me? Hush. But you've awoken the lion. You're screwed. I'm telling everything. Come on, man! That's the reason we keep kidnapping you. Baby, why are you being like this? "Baby?" I mean… Osman, honey, look. You're just a kid. Even if we explained it to you, there are things you wouldn't understand. -Like what? -Like… Like love. To hell with love! Why did you marry my brother then? I mean, it's not like he's any different. He's cheating on you too. With whom? Hang on. What are you saying, Osman? -Tarık would never cheat on me. -Yeah, right. I saw it myself. He was kissing Müjde. Müjde who? Formatter Davut's girlfriend. -Wow. -What the… That whore! How did that even happen? I was surprised too. Hülya, what's all this? What a slut! She even dared come to my wedding. But I knew it. I knew something was up. I had never seen Tarık drink before, but he was wasted at his own wedding! -Was he drinking? -Yeah. That's bad. -Why is that so bad? -He has a serious alcohol problem. He was in rehab for two years. He goes berserk when he drinks. What? He was in rehab? Why didn't he tell me? We were hiding it from you. He wanted it that way. Oh, come on! What else am I going to find out tonight? What about you two? Fate brought us together, Osman. I mean, we did do some bad things, but it wasn't our intention. Give me that. Osman, I'm sorry. I have to play this safe. How long have you known Tarık? Two years. I wasn't into him at first. But he was adamant. Very adamant. Plus, he was always very gentle and nice. He always wanted me. So, after I gave up on you… -And Buse? -What about her? I mean, how did you two meet? How did it end in marriage? Buse is my boss's daughter. He's the actual Gültepe vendor. I was in a bad place, too, after our thing. Buse was adamant too. I mean, she's a bit blunt, but she's not a bad person. I didn't want to at first. But not because I gave up on you. I didn't want to because she was the daughter of my boss. Then, you know, we're not getting any younger. My mom and dad wanted grandchildren. That's how it went. Remember the first time we met? What? Let's take it away. Hold on! Wait! Put it back so I can hop on. Ma'am, we're sailing off. Just take the next one. You haven't sailed off yet. Please let me on. Dude, just let her on. Look at her. She ran all the way here. I can't. The captain would get mad. Just take the next one, ma'am. -Give me your hand. -No, thanks. -We could fall. -I promise, you'll be fine. What are you doing, man? That's not allowed, dude! What the hell are you doing, man? I'm Serkan. I'll call you. Okay. I'm Hülya. People normally exchange numbers when they first meet, but you… You threw your phone at me. I was afraid you'd just sell it. -It was brand-new. -Come on. I was still paying the installments. I knew you were broke as hell at that first dinner date. Mademoiselle. -Monsieur. -Thanks. Bon appétit. A very posh place for a first dinner date. I guess you have taste. I was actually going to invite you over to a friend's place and cook for you as a surprise, but I changed my mind so as not to appear too forward. Do you think I'd eat anything you cook, Serkan? -Why wouldn't you? -I don't know you that well. I don't know if you're hands are clean. I wash them constantly! And those "surprises" at your friend's place… I'm not falling for that. I mean, I just thought we'd lie down and watch a movie after we ate. Let's go to the movies then. It's not as comfortable though. Maybe we shouldn't get too comfortable. You can lie down and-- And then what? What happens after we lie down? I mean, it'd be nice and… Thank you. Wow. Cheers. -This is too much. -Don't turn it down. Come on. It was nice, you know. Thank you so much. Come on. -Check, please. -Of course, sir. Monsieur. Can I have a glass of water? Is something wrong? Did you leave your wallet in your other pair of pants or something? I left my card at home. Let's split it then. How much is it? -1,200 liras. -What? -1,200 liras. -What? What? That's as high as a mortgage payment! All right. How much do you have? 335 liras. To reach 1,200… No, I don't have the rest. -Are we thinking the same thing? -I'll go first. Wait for me at the bus stop. I'll leave whatever we have and run. Okay. Monsieur! The check! -Forgive me! -Wait, man! -Wait! Stop! -Come on, run! Monsieur, stop! -Come back! -Run! I just didn't have enough money. What was I supposed to do? -So, do you remember when… -What? …you met Doruk? -Hülya. -Yeah? Don't say "yeah." Say "sweetie." Excuse me? -I mean, if you want to-- -Baby! -What's up? -Oh, Doruk. -Not much. You? -You know, I was just strolling around. Cool. Well, have a nice stroll then. I'm tired, baby. Doruk, Serkan. Serkan, Doruk. Doruk's a friend from high school, and Serkan's my… my boyfriend. Really? Your boyfriend? You told me you didn't want a boyfriend. I chased you so much. Were you lying? Sorry, bro. I have nothing against you. Aren't you a bit too offhand? Do I sense tension? I'm from the hood, man. Don't try my patience. I swear your eyes and ears will switch places after I'm done with you. How am I your bro, even? You're from the hood? Hülya, you're such an odd couple. How did this even happen? Fuck off! -Fuck off! -Stop! -Walk away! -I'll text you! -Fuck off! -Stop, Serkan! Serkan, get back here. Come here. -I swear I'll fuck him up. -Come on. Let's just leave. I don't like this place, sweetie. "Sweetie"? You sounded so beautiful. -Say it again. -Sweetie. Are you for real? -One more time, please. -Sweetie. -Give me a kiss. -Come on. -What? This is Izmir. Just one kiss. -People are looking! -Come on, please. -No. Don't make me remember him. What an asshole. -Hülya? -Yeah? Where have you been? I looked everywhere. -The cake is about to arrive. -Right. Mine's about to arrive too! I'm late as well! I have to go too! I mean, it's the procedure. I have to cut it. Not that I want to. Nermin, take Osman to the cellar, please. -Where's the cellar? -I'll show you. You know what? Don't bother. I'll go lock myself up. Just take him. Let's go. See you. Hülya. Everything happens for a reason. This is not a coincidence. If things go to shit, will you elope with me? I mean… Serkan, I'm still in love with you. But I haven't forgiven you. This is all your fault. I mean, this could've been our wedding. The camera! Buse has the camera! We're screwed if she takes a look! -Buse has it? -Yeah. Run, you idiot! Hülya, I never cheated on you. Wait up. We're here. What is your problem with this guy? Why do you keep knocking him out? Shut up, you brat. You shouldn't have meddled in the adults' business! I'll have you all locked up. Don't talk like that in front of the lady. I swear I'll tie you up. After you. -Nermin? -Yeah? Aren't we acting too selfless for a best man and maid of honor? I mean, kidnapping wasn't one of my plans, but… life brought us here. Well… I mean, we wouldn't have met if it weren't for this. We can tell this to our grandchildren. How life brought us here. -What are you looking at? -Just checking if my dad would like you. So, you like me too? Well, what can I say? Last time I had a boyfriend, the German mark was still a thing. -I'm only human after all. -So you say. Not now. After you. You kidnapped me first. Why? Because if you were to tell on them before I made my move, there'd be a fight and my photos would be worth nothing. Oh, you took their photos and blackmailed them? You're a smart kid. But two ladies brought you here. They were saying you were dead. You were unconscious. I was scared shitless when I saw you. What was that? I don't know, either. So, why are you here again? I think they knocked me out and took my camera. Why are you here? I'm just destined for this. -May God save your soul, brother. -Thanks, sir. Yours too. If and when I get out of here, I'm going to tell everything. I have a few accounts to settle too. What are we waiting for? What do you mean? They locked us up. We have to wait for someone to save us. Hang on. Those morons. They forget to lock up every single time. Did you steal the camera, Serkan? What? Did someone steal the camera? Yeah. I put it on the table, and it wasn't here when I came back. Either you took it or someone from your side did. My side would never steal. Fuck. Who stole it? Stop playing games, Serkan! You didn't want to hand it over! I had to force you! You kept telling me stories about the unconscious photographer! What game are you playing? Just shut up! You couldn't look after it! It's your fault it's gone! There were photos in it! Photos of what? Photos of what exactly, Serkan? My mom's here. Look! She has the camera! I'm so screwed. What's going on? Explain these photos! That's why you didn't want to give her the camera! Were you the one who knocked the photographer out? You pig! Speak! No! I knocked him out! No! I knocked him out! -No! I knocked him out! -No! I knocked him out! Cemil, you don't know shit. Stop trying to be a hero! Fuck me for letting you marry my daughter! I was going to make you the Alsancak vendor! Shame on you! Get a hold of yourself! I don't want anything from you. There are ladies here! Don't swear! On top of it all, the girl in the photos is your ex! -It's Hülya! -How do you know that? Shame on you! You prick! We gave you our lovely daughter, plus a dishwasher and a washing machine. Is this how you repay us? What's going on, Züleyha? Whom did he kiss? You remember his ex? Hülya. Oh, Hülya? I liked that girl a lot. -What happened? -The wedding next door is hers. No way! They saw each other and couldn't resist, so they kissed. What a nice girl she was though. How is she nice? She's the worst! I'm going to kill that whore! -Wow! -Buse! -Buse, wait! -Stop, Buse! -I'll show her! -Buse! -I'll kill you two! -Buse, hang on. -I'll kill you! -Calm down, Buse. God damn you. -You'll all answer for this. -Buse, it's not her fault! -Why did you have to want more? -Let's talk! -You pig! -Just calm down. -Please, Buse. -I'll fuck her up. -Buse, don't do this. -I'll never forgive you! -Okay, but-- -Never ever! -Let's just talk it out. -You fucked me up! What are you going to accomplish by going there? -I'll show her! -Buse, stop! I'll show you all! Did you drink spirits or something? You can't even stand straight. I'm here in spite of all the murderers, all the traitors, and all the tyrants. Why are you so upset? Did you lose it when you saw Müjde? What's wrong? You nearly choked. Hurry up! Get over here! Serkan, don't touch me! Hülya! Serkan! Take the cake away! Come on! What is this? Explain yourself. -You… -Don't you dare. Let him. You're going to kick his ass anyway. Are you going to explain yourself, or do I need to wipe the floor with you? There's going to be a fight, Ayten. I invited Hayko Cepkin to this? I'm glad he had a meeting. We would have been so embarrassed! Hey, you! Who are you to wipe the floor with my daughter? What the hell is this anyway? Are you thugs or something? Ask that of your daughter who was kissing someone else's husband. Watch your mouth, lady. It's your daughter who should've watched her mouth. -Come on. We're supposed to be in-laws. -In-laws? This is over! Who's the perverted guy who kissed our daughter-in-law? It's him! Why did we ever think he was good enough for our daughter? How dare you kiss someone else's daughter-in-law? And you, my daughter-in-law… aren't you going to say something? Explain this scandal! I deserve an explanation from you too. Your son is apparently an alcoholic! He was in rehab for two years. You never told me. How dare you dishonor me? I'm going to kill you! Hey, calm down. Get back, son. The guy you're calling "son" is having an affair with your girlfriend! Since we're settling scores. Just saying. See? Their son-in-law kissed that guy's girlfriend! So it's not only my son who's doing it. You people exaggerate everything. Are you insane or something? What did we do to deserve being in-laws with you? God damn you all! Mr. Levent, please don't curse at people. Curses have a way of coming back to you. Piss off. Tarık… what is she talking about? She's lying, Mr. Davut. I swear. Damn it, Tarık. God damn it. You ended up being in the wrong. You won't ever grow up. Please. Stop, Davut. Davut, calm down. Tarık is like a son to you, isn't he? -She's lying! -No, I'm not. Osman told me. The kid's like a black box. He saw them kissing secretly. Osman did? Where is Osman? Osman's alive? Thank you, God! Thank you for sparing my brother's life! Was Osman dead? Of course not. He's healthy as an ox. -Müjde… -Baby… Get your ass over here! Stop running! How dare you do this to me, Hülya? Oh, come on! Shut up, man! Wait your turn! It's my turn now. Calm down. What are you doing? You defending your girlfriend or your wife? Both. I'm against all violence. Buse, get a hold of yourself. Come here. Honey, we can talk this out. Talk what out? You people ruined the wedding! Shut up! Why do you always have to be so arrogant? You're just a vendor! Enough is enough! You never shut up about it! Watch your mouth or I'll tear that mouth off of your face! I'd love to see you try, you bitch! Come on, Auntie! She just called me a bitch! -Calm down! -I'm going to fuck you up. Just wait! Just shut up. Auntie! God! What are you doing, Auntie? Calm down! Dad! Mom, calm her down. Can you hear me, Mr. Levent? Stop it! Get over here, you scoundrel! How am I a scoundrel and you're not? -It's not the same thing, you bastard! -We're in love, dude! One hit to the head won't do any damage. His skull is not made of glass. You people exaggerate everything. I'm going to kill you! Let me go! You bitch! Who are you calling a bitch? What makes your ass so precious? Is it made of gold or something? I pitied you back in the restroom! I thought you were poor, you pig! Listen! I didn't want this to happen either! Let everyone hear! Listen to me! I'm so sorry, but this is love! It can happen even at your wedding! I'm sorry! Mom, she's talking about love! Get over here! -Leave me alone! -To hell with this! Son! Tarık, get over here! Mom! Hülya! Where is he, man? Hülya! Where is he? Be careful! Hülya! Go find him! Hülya! Find him! Show it to everyone! Is it made of gold? Is it, huh? -Let her go! -Go away! Hülya! -Find him! Come on! -He's gone, Mom! Mom, I can't find Serkan! My hands are full! Forget him! Why are you still looking for him? TAXI Osman, apparently the saying is true. It's impossible to keep a secret. -Looks like things got out of hand. -Those were the two. -Those two? -They were the first ones to knock me out. I love to watch them get beaten up. They got what they deserved. Should we call the cops before someone dies? Makes sense. What is going on in here? Hülya, things escalated so quickly. I wish your mom didn't get beaten up. Hülya, remember what I offered you back in the yard? -I asked if you'd elope with me. -Yes. You would? Hell yeah! That's not what I meant. I just said yes, I remember. -I see. -You're ridiculous. I don't trust you. Once a cheater, always a cheater. Plus, I'm tired of getting cheated on! My boyfriend cheated on me. My husband did at the wedding. I'm not going anywhere with you. Hülya, why won't you believe me? I didn't cheat on you. -Yeah, right. -I didn't. Excuse me. Sorry for interrupting. Some woman wants to see you. She says it's important. What woman? Who is she? I can't handle another woman, dude. -Come on, Hülya. Run. -I'm running. Slow down. -Oh, Hayko! How are you? -Hello. Hi. I'm Serkan. Cemil's son. -Nice to meet you. -You too. -Dad's waiting for you. -Thanks. -Serkan! -Run. -Congratulations. -Oh, you're Hayko. -Hello. -Serkan! I'm your wife! Where are you? -I'll kill you! -I'd like to see you try! What the hell is this? He's here! I swear he's here! Look, it's Hayko Cepken! Hang on! Welcome, Hayko! -Cemil, what is going on in here? -Traditional unpleasantries. Hayko, they love you around here, brother! I wish they'd notice you're here. They'd tear this place down! Get over here! Stop! That's no way to treat a lady. Daddy? Serkan, can you please just stop? Serkan! Serkan, I love you! Stop! Why did you go behind my back? That's your specialty, Buse. -Cansu? -The Tepecik vendor? -What is this? -What are you doing here? I saw your hashtag. How do you know each other? Honey, two solid photos are enough for me. Exactly. As long as they look intimate. Maybe a photo where you almost kiss. I mean, don't kiss him, but almost kiss him. Don't worry. I'll handle it. We're having so much fun here. I hope we can have even more fun in the coming hours. Don't have too much fun, okay? Revenge is a dish best served cold, Buse. I've waited years for this. Not only had you made me a pawn in your ugly game, you had me fired with your lies. -I had to get my revenge. -When did you take those photos? You were already tired because of the dancing. You fell asleep almost as soon as I started talking. I snapped them very quickly. By the way, my dad's alive and kicking. I'm sorry, Serkan. She told me she'd talk with her dad to make me manager, but when she was done with me, she started rumors about me sleeping around at meetings. As a result, I was fired. Do you believe me now? Serkan... I did everything out of love. I even fought with my parents for you. Yes, I set you up. Whatever evil thing I did, I did it because I love you. Because I think no one can love you more than I do. And it's obvious you loved me more too, since you married me. We're family now. Family? What are you talking about? What family? You see? What goes around comes around. Of all the nerve! You even admit you set him up! You had me believe my boyfriend was cheating on me with her, which wasn't happening at all, and destroyed my life! So God made sure you saw photos of us kissing and destroyed your wedding! Serkan, I'm still your lawfully wedded wife. What are you talking about? Did you really think that'd work? It's over! Let's ask Serkan. Serkan, would you like to stay married to a person like her, or... or would you like to marry me? I mean, we're already married, so... No need to bother with all that paperwork. Buse, I'm sorry, but I've never liked you. You were tenacious, so I accepted defeat and played along. But I never moved on. Now that I know what you did, I don't even want to see you, let alone stay married to you. I've made my decision. Serkan, hop in! The police are here! Come on, hurry up! -Serkan! -Stay away! -Go! -Where do you think you're going? Oğuz, floor it! Serkan, where are you going? Let me go! Serkan! Serkan, I'm your wife! We're married! Shut up, you bitch! -Leave me alone! -I'll show you alone! Let me go, you bitch! My gown! -You ruined my wedding gown! -You ruined my life! Why was Buse with you, dude? And who was the other girl? Remember my affair at the vendors' meeting? That was the girl. Cansu. Wow, man! The nerve on you! He has a car, he rides a bike, and now he's on a skateboard! How can you be so shameless? Hülya, what's going on? I'll tell you what. Apparently, he never cheated on me. The photos, the girl... They were all fake. Guess who arranged it? Buse! Fuck this shit all the way to hell! Sorry, love. -"Love"? -God must've made me say it. Nermin, when did you two get so saucy? Well, it all started when we were trying to kidnap Osman. Then we went further. We were really civilized up until just now. -He got rude for some reason. -Sorry. Never mind that now. Honey, that's some shocking news! Serkan, where did you even find this girl? -She was the vendor's daughter. -What vendor? It's a long story. Oğuz, I'm starving here, man. Go find us a diner or something. Come on, please! -I have a question. -Yeah? Where are we going? I second that. To Istanbul. I don't know. People always go there when they're running away. A great plan from a great man. I'm in. Well, then, let's listen to some music, love. "Love?" Welcome to Kral Pop! You came around, huh? -Serkan. -Yeah? What will we do in Istanbul? I don't know, man. They say it's a city of opportunities. If it doesn't work out, we'll come back. Izmir is our home. Our next song is from Mrs. Güler in Trabzon, dedicated to her son, Kemal, and his friends, who are on military service in Narlıdere, İzmir.
