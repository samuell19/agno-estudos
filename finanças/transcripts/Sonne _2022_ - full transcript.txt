These pins are so tiny. Oh my God, a new profile pic. Yas, queen! Go get your hijab done by Yesmin Yas, queen! Are there assless burkas? Get your tits out, bitch! - With a hole round the ass? - Do couple pics. Why is your fat arse in my face? Because it's just too fat. Actually it's dead nice, girl. A singing Muslim, bro. Think your mother lies in this thing and thinks, "Oh, yeah." - "Dad's coming home today." - I own that burka. You're disgusting. No, my mother's not the type. - What type? A sexy type? - When did she last wear it? No idea. I've never felt both so ugly and sexy at the same time. Ok, ready. Get closer together. Not on top of each other, but ok... Sit down. Yeah, ok. Ah, that's so... That's disgusting. Look at her. That look sucks. You have to imagine I'm gay and on Grindr, then... It worked better than I thought. That's me in the corner That's me in the spot-light Losing my religion Put your hand on the mirror. It's so dramatic. I thought that I heard you sing Maybe move down a bit so your head starts here. Oh no I've said too much Now freak out. Go on. I thought that I heard you sing - No, no twerking. - Stop it. The distance in your eyes What are you doing? Stop filming. - It's so not important. - Turn the music down. Kerim. - Ok, so I'm Kerim. - Ok. "Why you so retarded? What you doing?" Losing my religion "Turn it down. Why you so retarded?" - Turn it down. - Come and join us, Kerim. I think I thought I saw you try SONNE You're doing a good job. You're doing a good job. Really good. It's disgusting. Why's it disgusting? Back hair. I hope Kerim doesn't end up like this. The Kurds descended from apes after all. - Done this bit yet? - No, not yet. - Ah, ok. - I started at the top. Do right at the top here. I'm going out, Dad. - What? - I'm going out. Where? Kerim, where? You were out till 3:00 yesterday. Let him be, it's just to see his friends for an hour. He goes out every day and you never say not to go. Always. He's doing nothing wrong. It's just for an hour. He's back in an hour. You and your daughter, go to the bathroom. You never say Kerim must stay home. He can go wherever he wants. You make day night, night day. What's wrong with you? - You're a disaster... - You're over-reacting, Dad. You're really stupid. Think about it. What's wrong with you? Look at your sister. She gets good grades. She'll go to university. And what do you do? She gets good grades and you have nothing. - Let him go for an hour. - He's not going today, Awini. He's not going out. He's been out the whole time. He's not going. I sit here. I won't let him go. Period. - I want to go out for an hour. - No, you can stick it up your arse. Stay home today. You go out every day. Let me go too. I work, it's different. You just... Get out. Don't speak ill of God. Your children learn that from you! - You ruined the family. - You... Kerim, aren't you up yet? You need your maths things today. Yesmin, are you awake? Get up and say your prayers, sweetheart. Say your prayers. So capital F is the function of lowercase f, for everything. - So F is an antiderivative of f. - "...antiderivative of f." Why is one of them capital F? So we have two different expressions as they're different functions. Both the same letter! - Capital F is the antiderivative... - "Capital F is the antiderivative..." - I don't need a prompter, just write. - How do you spell "prompter"? Please be quiet there. Good. How's it looking? We've already looked at derivatives. Zero equals 1. I didn't catch that. Maybe it's for the best. So X, when there's only X here, we could think X is to the power of 1, no need to write that, and then using the same rule, minus X to the power of two divided by two... And X is equal to 1. And then one remains... Please don't forget your homework. Think she really looks like that? Oh my God, you're so disgusting. Why must I have that on my phone? Yesmin, oh Yesmin. Dance number. Just a cig. I think I thought I saw you try Every whisper, of every waking hour Why did you do that? I use those to pray. - Why are you over-reacting? - I'm not. They're the clothes I wear to pray. You're making fun of that. - It's just a video. - You have make-up on. We're just singing. My God! - Nail polish, make-up. - You know I wear polish. You're making fun of our culture and religion. - I'm not. - Of the things I wear to pray. Why? - Why always over-react to everything? - I'm not. What do you mean over-react? You keep pushing till something happens. That's not on. Awini, what's happened? - Look at what your daughter has done. - What's she done? - Look. Show him. - What is it, Kerim? - What's she done? - She's over-reacting. It's not over-reacting. I'm not over-reacting. Awini, what's wrong with you? It's perfectly normal. - You think that's normal? - That's the world today. Look at what she's wearing. - That's quite normal. - It's not allowed, it's your fault. It's not a problem. Leave Yesmin be. If your relatives saw the video, what would they say? What burden are you carrying on your back? What's this about? Watch it properly. She has stress at school, she comes home, more stress. She should have some peace and quiet at home. Good, if you agree to it, ok. She can carry on then. - Incredible how you over-react. - Why get so upset? If he thinks it's ok, so do you. But never mind. Oh, so if he thinks it's ok, it's ok? You say, "If it's ok for you, then it's ok for me." - Go to your room and don't be a pain. - Shut up. - It's all because of you. - Me? - Yes. - Stop it. - It's normal. - They've got hijabs I wear... - That's not true life. - You're driving us mad. Why? I'm just telling you you should take care of your children. I thought that I heard you laughing Without Lia Bella, Nati, You nice pic of your mom! Hey peeps, why did you post this video? Well, we said we'd see if it's any good. - None of us thought it'd be much. - Yeah, we said that. But we never said if it's good, we'd post it on YouTube. - But it was so good, so funny. - It's embarrassing. When I'm sitting in the corner and the light comes on. Sorry, Yesmin, can you chill please. Can you sit down? It's so unimportant. - You're just upset we did it. - I'm not upset we made the video. - I'm upset you didn't ask me. - Sure. But where's the problem? Everyone thinks it's dead cool. I didn't say it was crap, but I think it's stupid you didn't ask me. I didn't ask Bella either. She just wrote, "Cool, now we're making money." Yeah, but you know she doesn't care, but I do. I didn't know it would upset you. That wasn't my intention. Look, I'm doing a magic trick. Oh, Yesmin, you're so... What do you think of the shirt? Are you...? - It's shite. - Is it hot or too slutty? Yesmin is jealous. - Take her seriously. - It's only 5 euro. You have to take Yesmin seriously. She's jealous. Kerim, burp. - I can't do it. - No, wait. Wait. Burp, Kerim. Shit! Trying to keep up with you And I don't know if I can do it - Hello. - Hello. Oh no I've said too much Mashallah! I thought that I heard you laughing How do you... What language is that? - Do you know Alif-Alifwatha or what? - No, Baba. They're all strangers on the internet. - Ah. - Yes. Where can I write comments? Where is it? - No, Baba, don't write a comment. - Why not? - It's embarrassing. - No! - I liked it. - I definitely won't tell you. - You can... - You can tell me you liked it. I'm writing, see. Very nice. Baba, I'm going. Someone wrote, "Keep going. Talented women!" See what she's doing. It's shit. The comments are really nice. Oh life The lengths that I will go to The distance in your eyes It's so bad. - I'm camera woman and director. - Really? - Yep. - That's why it's bad. That's why you don't see me. I was filming it. Like a lesbian thing. That's me in the spot-light Losing my religion - How come so many clicks? - I wonder that too. Cos it's so weird. OMG, I've lost an eye! Hello. I'm a superstar Well, superstar, whassup? - Collected followers? - Give me a cig. She's only here cos she needs more followers. True, the only reason she's with her sexy sisters. - Yo! - Hi. Sorry. Popstars first. Band, band, band! - Popstar? - Popstar? Popstar, popstar. - Popstar. - Popstar, popstar? - Drummer, drummer. Background singer. - Background dancer, whatever.

Your eyes are so big. - So big! - Bro, what have you taken? - What have you taken? Think you took Retarded. - It said 'Retarded'. - Was it Blue Pepsi or Pink Strawbs? - I took Fame. - That on the menu? - I took Fame. - Mum will be thrilled to see you. - You've my trousers on. - They wouldn't fit. - They're clearly mine! - No. - You took my... - Stop it. So annoying! You've pulled out my hair! What is this!? - She'll be happy. - But she's asleep. - It's cos you're not singing. - I can't sing. Good to know. You prance around online, then go "I can't sing". What's your problem? I thought you were the only normal one. - Stop it! - No, I want you to sing for Mum. - What then? - Stop. Hello. Mum. - Why's there nothing to eat? - I'm on it. Hello, my shitty sister says we should eat more salad. What do you say to that? Dude... I can't believe our Mum wasted her vagina on you. What a thing to say! This apple tastes three days old. I'm Kurdish too. Different pronunciation maybe. Yes, I'm a Kurd from Sina, Iran. - Oh, ok, welcome. - Thank you. - Dad, stop talking to other women. - What? - Stop talking to other women. - Really? Yes. Swap places? Oh, why? Really? - Just don't talk to other women. - Ah, ok. I'll say "Welcome..." "Welcome to my wedding." - Should we stand? - Yes, now would be good. Go ahead, Uncle. Come on, get up. Come on, sing! What is it? Sing, come on. Sing, stand up. Come on. Come on, Yesmin, come on, my daughter. Sing the song. Go on, sing. Why now? - Sound, music? Is there no music? - What sound? My dear guests, welcome to my wedding. These three hard-working girls will now sing a song. Oh life is bigger It's bigger than you And you are not me The lengths that I will go to The distance in your eyes Oh no I've said too much I set it up That's me in the corner That's me in the spot-light Losing my religion Trying to keep up with you And I don't know if I can do it Oh no I've said too much I haven't said enough We'll go at the back. - Is it good like that? - Yesmin in the middle. Bella on the outside. Yes, that's perfect. Very nice. I, in the snow of a white mountain I, in the snow of a white mountain Stop it! Please! "Es Befrem" means I am very beautiful, like... very beautiful, extremely beautiful. You've learnt it already. Oh, you cunt, right in the ribs! Pay for us to fly to Kurdistan? Sure, we'll fly end of the month. For sure. - Ok, to...Erbin. - Direct from Vienna-Schwechat to... It's Erbil. - Direct to Erbil. - Erbil? Yes. Austrian Airline. Austrian Airlines, not Arab Emirates. No, Austrian Airline is perfect. For sure, 100 per cent. You all invited. On mine... really. - On your...? - Returns. Everything. - It's on you. - On... It's what you say when someone pays. We'll never come back. That's great. Take her with you. - If it means she'll never come home. - We're going together. Stush! We can go through here. keep up with you And I don't know if I can do it Oh no I've said too much my confessions I thought that I heard you laughing I thought that I heard you sing I think I thought I saw you try Is that ok? Cool. Shall we do one? - Can I come this close? - Yeah, course. Hello. - Greetings from... - Maybe to my Mum. She loves you. So always only ever positive comments. No, not always. There are always some negative ones. You'll never be able to do something that is 100 percent well received. There will always be people who say it's wrong, that we're mocking and we're joking around with religion. That's not the case. Our friend wears a hijab and we like and accept her and we don't care whether or not she wears a hijab. As I said, each to their own. What does your mother say about that? - Not much. - Ok. My father's the one who is proud of it and encouraged us to make more of it. So, he definitely thinks highly of it and thinks we're going much further. We now have this platform and now we sort of have a voice and we will use that for the right things. Great. What are the right things? I'd say simply to inspire young women. Because we recently did a performance and someone came up to us and said how inspiring we are and how people in hijabs are immediately pigeonholed, because they can't do anything, can't sing or dance. They don't dare do anything. They're repressed. So they thought it was very exciting and inspiring that we dared and dare to go on stage in front of the cameras and give them hope and strength. - Mashallah. - Yesmin, don't you suffocate in this? It makes me feel sick. It's pressing on my Adam's apple. Dude. Hello and welcome to our Vlog. With Nati and Yesmin and Omaaaar! - Omaaaar! - Omaaaar! Whassup fans! We'll soon have part 2 of "Losing My Religion" for you. Yes, you can soon pre-order it. And merchandise: there'll be hijabs with our faces on them. Gonna be out somewhere near next year It's bigger It's bigger than you And you are not me The lengths that I will go to The distance in your eyes Oh no I've said too much I set it up That's me in the corner That's me in the spot-light Losing my religion Trying to keep up with you And I don't know if I can do it Oh no I've said too much I've said too much I set it up That's me in the corner That's me in the spot-light What's she doing here? Kerim, come home. - Because? - Baba says to. So? He wants you home. This means trouble. - What is it? - Come home. - Why? - There are problems. - Because of? - Yes, your problems. - Come on. - What problems? - Come with me. - Stop it. - Come with me. - Stop pulling me. When he wants you home, you come. - What is it? - What's wrong? Think you're some gangsters, or what? You drink and smoke. I'm not coming just cos you want me to. - Dad says to. - Then he'll tell me himself. He's sent me! What don't you get? - We don't vex your squad. - Don't touch! What's your problem, man? - Calm down. - Don't interfere. You're the one interfering. We're sitting here and you come and vex us. You friends with this retard? - Retard? - Yes, you are. Go home. You can say it 100 times, but he's not coming. - What the fuck's your problem? - What's yours? - Piss off. - Go home. Go help your mother in the kitchen. Nothing better to do? - Kerim. - Go home. - Shut up! - Go home! - Kerim, come on. - Go home! - What's wrong with you? - Stop it. - Go away. - Stop it. Go home. Let's go. Let's go. What a cunt. - Let's go. - She's so vexing! 3 unread messages Yesmin, can you pick up? We’re getting nowhere We need to rehearse. You two aren’t interested Hellooo? - More to come now. - Amazin'. - You look like Dracula. - Yay. The wind will dry it. - We're invited. We're going. - Care for your kids! Where you going? - To the celebrations. - Don't, sit down. Yesmin's coming with me. Where? Awini, everyone's there. All Kurds. It's a Kurdish feast. Stay home. I'm sick. The fridge is empty. Your son is out. Take care of our home. She won't go and won't let us go. - Come with us. - I'm sick. I can't. You're always out. You know nothing of your son. You're always with your daughter. Take care of us. Why do this? Why are you doing this? You're not listening. It's like talking to a brick wall. You're only ever with the girl. Are you her age? Take care of your children. - What's up? - I'm looking for the eyelash stick. I want to do my beard. - Mascara? - Yes. I don't have any. Black, right? - Yes, it's black. - Oh, thank you. What are you doing? Baba, I think Bella's here. Can you open the door? Yes, right away. A Kurdish bride. Really. Princess. - Yesmin in her room? - Please go in. - Hey, bro. - I'm a Kurdish princess. I hate my life. Tell me about it. My sisters are the world's worst cunts. Anna is such a cunt and Jessica is always in your face. They get worked up about all I do. They have a band, you know, and they make music. But we make music too and they make fun of us. Talking of music... ...what do you make of what Nati did? I don't know. My mic volume was low too. And your mics were too loud. I don't know. I don't think she means any harm. What was that? - Hello. - Kurdish tank. What's that? - That's... take a look inside. - Taxi to... Oh, snacks! Will you drive me to Kurdistan? You stand in the middle. And you here. - They don't understand. - Omar, we don't. Kids, lie down. - Lie down? - Kurdish clothes. Not just anything. Yes, that's it. That's it. Perfect. Like that. Wow! Come on! - Take his hand. - Omar! - Left. - What? - What? - Left foot. - There? Right? - Yes. Twice. - Then like this... - Hop? - Exactly. - Whoah! I've got it! - That's Bella. - Bella's good at it. Yesmin! Yesmin! Why isn't your friend dancing? Ask her. - What? - What's your name? - Yesmin. - Yesmin. Good to meet you. Nice name. - Where you from originally? - Iraq. - From Iraq? - Yes. I come from Syria. - Cool. - Cool. Want to go and dance with your friends? I promised to take you with me. Tell them, later, ok. They'll understand. - Ok. - Ok. - Promise? Right? - Yeah, maybe. - Kani-war. - Kaniwar. Sounds like Kani-noir. It's a Kurdish name. - Can I say "Kani"? - You can. - I'll say "Kaniwar". - What about you? Midas. - What? - Midas. Midas. Everything he touches turns to gold. - What do you do? - Accountant. - Oh, fancy! What's the story? - Fancy! - It's just mathematical. - But you weren't soldiers? No. No, no, we're not. With her, with soldiers, it's "Oh my God, soldiers". - We have to dance. - No. And she pulls me onto the dance floor. It worked, congratulations. - What do you do? - School. - Final year. - You from Austria too? Yes, half Yugoslavian. I'm from Austria. And you? - I'm a Kurd. - Where from? - From Iraq. - Can you speak Kurdish? Yes. - Yes? - Yes. - That's funny. - What? What do you mean? Look, I know... I don't know many Kurds who speak Kurdish. I know more. I'm a Kurd. But the ones who are born here... You were born here. - Yes. - It shows. So they can't speak Kurdish. - I see. - That's why I asked. - Depends if the parents teach them. - Yeah. Parents want kids to learn German but not their mother tongue. What dialect do you speak? You said you're from Syria, I'm from Iraq. We have different dialects. I don't really speak Yugoslavian, but I understand it. - Do you speak German? - I speak German. He really has a shisha! You've got a shisha! Yes, a little shisha bar. - You've come prepared! - But don't tip drink in there. Is that 2 centilitres? She's boozing already. We've only just got here, man. - May I? - Yeah, yeah. - Here. - Give me that. - I've never seen that in my life. - She'll drink with us. - Wait. - Here. Habibi, what's this? - What's your problem? - Totally haram. - If we go to hell, then all together. - Totally. - We can say hello to the devil, right? - Nice of you. To Yesmin. You're drinking that like it wasn't the first time. But yours! Oh my God! - You arse! - Oh my God, sorry! Right in the puddle. - Right in the puddle. - My poor Kurdish dress. Stupid whore! Anything but that! Stop it. I'm about to fall over. I've never liked you more. - Stop filming. - Piss off! Piss off. You've still got some. Not anymore. No, dude, shut up! Shut up! - Twerk, bitch! - Stop it! - Twerk, bitch. - I don't want this car... It doesn't matter. They drank alcohol and met someone, it doesn't matter. You don't have to worry so about it. You're a hard-working girl. I'm proud of you. Truly, Yesmin. You're your father's girl. My heart. I love you. But they came with us and should have come back with us. Yes, but I think they were drunk. Drunk, in a good mood. Young women, that always happens. But... Omaar! - Mr Amin? - Yes. Could we come in for a moment? - What is it? What's happened? - It's about your son. We want to ask if the man in the photo is your son. - May we come in for a moment? - Do you have ID? They're police. They have orders. Is it something criminal? - No, no. - Is he hurt? - Nothing's happened to him. - Then why? - May we come in? - Please come in. - You can't just let people in. - We'll explain inside. Please. That's Kerim's room and that's his sister's and... - He's not here, for sure. - Yes, it's like this: Your son recorded a video with a gang. I wanted to ask if it's your son on the video. And two police officers come here at night just for that? - Yes. - Awini, it's standard. It's their job. Police's job... need to know where our son is. That's from the state. There's been a complaint, so we're investigating. You just have to confirm that this is your son. Is that your son? Yes, that's Kerim. What's the photo? A pig was killed in Lainz wildlife reserve. A video was made and posted on the internet. Your son can be seen on the video. So we're investigating the case. A pig killed, and you're here late at night for that. Exactly. Maybe you could call your son and if he doesn't answer, maybe you can give us his number. - Sure. - Then we can... Don't give them his number. I'll call him. - Please go and call your son. - I will. Don't give them any number. We don't know anything... Awini, calm down. Please. - 0699... - Why are you giving them the number? Why are you talking to these people? Giving them the number! Awini, we're in Austria, in Vienna. Nothing happen. What do you imagine? Whatever happens, we're here. - Which is Kerim's room? - That's his room. Kerim. But he's not there. Why come in? - He's not there. - Yes, ok. - Thank you. - Good evening. - Have a nice evening. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Thank you. Have a nice day. Why give his number? Awini, why are you such a disaster? Disaster? You give your son's number to...the police. Police have got it from state... They suspect your son done something. They have to clarify. They can't sit at home. - What are they doing here? - Suspect Kerim killed pig. Why are you still here? Get your coat and look for him! - Go and look for your son. - For God's sake. Can you contact him? You ask why did he do that, not why police here. He should go and do fitness, sport. But he goes and kills a pig. Maybe he didn't do it. He should come here and... - Why are you laughing? - He went and killed pig. Why did he kill a pig? Go look for him. See where he is. First call him, contact him. He's not answering. I have called him. Go and look. Put your jacket on and go. Hey, mate, are you retarded? Piss off, man. You ok now? Let it out. Let it out. Shit. - My God. There's so much. - It's all right. It's all right. It's dead nice. It's just so nice. - What is it? - So nice. How is it? How nice is it? On a scale of one to ten, how nice is it? Say, "My eyes are beautiful". Say "I like being with you". Say "I like you". Say... ..."I'm a Kurd". Who's writing to you, your whores? I think he has a love bite on his neck. - Turn round. - No love bite. - A big fat love bite. - No. Burnt yourself with hair straighteners, huh? - Burnt your neck straightening? - No, stop it. We'll all go together. Yesmin in her hijab. Sweating like mad. I lifted weights once, this thing, on my back, around 40 kilos. - Pretty sick, huh? - You're... - You can't. - Shoulders first. - You're so thin. - It hurt. - But you need time - She has a big weight bar at home. I couldn't lift it, but she did it, no sweat. And for your performances, do you wear hijabs? - We did one time. - Once. We were at a Muslim centre. - I see. - With women. Because I think this video... The niqab doesn't go with the song. Not at all with... With the moves you make. We meant no harm. We had no bad ulterior motives. But with hindsight I realise we may have gone too far and made fun of things a bit. - No, the thing is... - What the fuck?! What are you saying! You really made fun of things a bit. Why would I make fun of myself? Why would I make fun of the hijab when my best friend wears it? I can understand in the way we danced... - What? Where did we dance? - Where? - Right at the start of the video. - We did slut squad and smoked. Thing is, you're wearing the hijab you must respect it. Otherwise people don't respect you. You said it: I'm wearing it. And you go to a club. That doesn't go together. - I'm the one wearing it, not you. - Seriously, can we chill? - It's not a big deal. - Bella, look... Not so many people view it. I don't want to argue about it. Nor do we. But in my view... Girls in hijabs are allowed to dance too. They can be funny and sing. I want to say that. You're a role model. You must know what younger ones do. You say "I have people". Do you know what that means? You wear a hijab. Because of you, other girls... Haven't they a brain or parents to say...? They watch you on YouTube. - So they'll learn how women behave... - And you think that's good? Dancing, singing, all normal things. - But without a hijab. - What?! So when I wear a hijab, I should stay home and do nothing? It's not for them to say how I wear my hijab or how I should behave cos they don't wear one. I'm your friend, you should protect me when two guys criticise me with some nonsense. Just say, "Thanks for your view. Not interested. Bye." I did. If you don't get me, you keep quiet and they're like the hijab, respect... Just do it for me. I've someone who's kind to me for once. I know my culture. Kurds marry Kurds. He'll drop you when he's got what he wants. - That was a bit racist. - Yes. Admit it. - I'm sat there, torn. - Don't make a scene. Don't give an ultimatum. Some fucking friendship! - It's not an ultimatum. - Of course it is. - I just... - It's an ultimatum. I didn't say him or me. I said hang out with him, but don't call me! - Hush! - Exactly. - It's not my fault. Can you shut the fuck up now? We calm down and we go in now and then everything's fine. Come on, let's go. - Kerim. - No. I'm going out. - No, you're not. - I want to. No. Stay home. Have you forgotten the police were here? You, go away! You drove him to kill the pig. pigs are like lambs here. I don't understand. The pig belongs to someone. He can't kill someone's pig. Did I say he should kill it? Today You deleted this message. Can you two call me back? I'm not being filmed again. My parents are jarring right now. I'll be right down. What's your fucking problem? Get away from me. Give it me. Open the door. Open the door. - What's going on? - She took the key. - Open the fucking door. - No key. Where are you going? Go to your room. - Can you give me the key? - There's no key. Where's the fucking key? Where is it? - Get out of my room. - No. - Get out. - Shut up. Get out. Don't touch my things. I'm touching your things cos you've got the key. Sit down. Get out. Give me the fuckin' key. - Out! - Give me the key. Get out. Give it. Kerim. Hey! Hello? Kerim's not coming. Please go away. Go to your room and be quiet. Give me the key. Stop it. Stop it! Go to your room. Who are they? I said you're not going out. Do your homework. Sit down and read something. What's this all about? Tell them your mother won't allow it. We could call the police. You go to your room too. Have you texted them yet? Let them ring. Go to your room. Kerim's not coming. Please go away. I'll call the police. Give me the fucking key. - Give it. Where is it? - Stop it. Leave your sister in peace. Stay there. - Give me the fucking key. - Stay in there. Where are you going? - I want to go out. - Stay in your room. Sit down. No. Sit down. Like so. And so. And like so. You numpty. - Slower! - Yeah, I... That's great. I'm very proud. - Where? - In that gap. How about this? Oh, yes! Oh my God, a new profile pic. Kurdi-ass-stan. With a Kurd like that, Kurdistan would be... I won. Kurdistan. Persian party is today… don’t forget Hello??, I think it’s strange that you’re not answering See what your children are doing. What sort of man are you? - I'm off to a function. - Where are you going? - You're always out, like children. - I'm bored here. Do you want your son to die? - Why should he die? - He will. The police are here daily. Help me, keep an eye on him. See what homework he has. You could call his teacher once in a while. Baba, I'm going. Ok. - Bye. - Are you going to drive me? - I'm a bit tired, really... - Then I'll take a taxi. Why not the tram? How can I take the tram? I've got high heels. You look pretty. - You're going out like that? - So? - Why? - You know it's a Persian celebration. You and your friends must be a bit conservative. - Yes, Baba, I have to go. - Ok. Wtf?? Meet outside the hotel?! I’m outside the hotel Where are you? In the room We’re already here - What's this? - What? This, 'Keeping Up With The Yesmin', or what? We match well. In terms of colour and glitz. I thought that was the plan, glitzy dresses. True. It was the plan. The difference is we're 100 percent dressed, not 50. - We swapped roles. That's why. - What roles? We've swapped roles. - Now you're the foreigners, not me. - Not so loud. - I'm not loud. - You are. - I'm not. - Omar said it's a conservative party. You don't understand, we swapped roles. - It's a conservative do. - You're so dramatic. I'm not, but you come here... - You're making a scene. - Fuck it! - Now you're... - If you'd checked your phones. - Why would I? - I've been texting you all day. - You could have just come here. - I'm here. And now you're freaking out? Yes! If you'd checked your phones you'd know how I was. I don't care, but I do care about this. Look at you! Too bad. I don't care. What do you care how I look? - It's not all about you. - It is now. Right, please leave. So, prime numbers. What are prime numbers, and what's the first one? If we know what they are, then it's not hard. Who remembers? Pi. Guys, Pi is something different. You're in the eighth grade, how will you pass the exam? Prime numbers can only be divided by themselves and one. - What's the first? - One. No, one is only divisible by one, but... - Two. - Two is the first one. Then... The next is... - Three. - Exactly, three. - Five. - Five, great. What are you doing? Stop it! Kerim, what's up, man? - You ok? - He's just retarded. Leave it. Oh! You've got that from Mum. How do you do that? - Dude. - Change now? - Mum. - Yes. Do another selfie. - It's a video. - Oh. - That's good. - Yes. You ready? Bella. Laugh. Ok? Ok? Was it ok? Yes, you fucking kids. Ok? Stop that now. - Hello! - Bella! Probably with six songs, all shit that no one will listen to. Why doesn't she do something with her life? Have to wait a bit. You don't get famous from this sort of programme. Look at the jury. They're supposed to be people who know about music. I only know one of them. - Why? He's good, on the right. - What have they done with music? I know presenter, I think he has no idea. Yes, he works at TV. But no one knows him. I didn't know if it'd be a good song to win over the audience. As a person, you're certainly... I'm sure she'll get male votes. Yes. Who's speaking? I hope you'll go further. I'll keep my fingers crossed. And now Uncle Sido. I had high hopes for you after the Björk song last time. What do you mean by 'missing'? Who is that? Did she say she'd planned anything with Nati? Have you spoken to Nati? Yes, but... What's happened? Something's happened. The police, already? But maybe they'll be in touch. What's happened? The only thing I can do is ask the other girls, but... I honestly can't think of anything else at the moment. What is it? Bella or her friend Natalie? That was Bella's sister. Yes, Bella and Nati haven't been home since yesterday. - They haven't been home? - No. - Were they in school? - No idea. Something's happened to them. They don't talk to me. - I don't think so. Wait and see. - How do you know? - Wait and see? - They were drinking or partying. Even if they were drinking. They may be in some apartment. Something may have happened to them. Is drinking good? It's bad. - Awini, they're just young people. - They're children. - We'll call. Tomorrow. - Then that will be two nights. my new girlfriend WTF Bella and Nati are in iraq don’t talk hodge - What you talking about? - Hodge man Don’t get it Yes just been to police, bitch Yesmin knows too. Heavy! Safe? I think iraq is part of the UK. Want to do exchange They with ISIS or what? They got tickets to Erbil now we know nothing Yesmin is from iraq too, right? Ha-ha ISIS so 2016!!! Statement Yesmin? Let's do it another time. No, it's fine. If you don't know what to do, just let me know. I've written a load already. Where have you got to? Here. What do you still have to do? This bit. I have to write it out. And this too. I can do that on my own. Writing it out isn't hard. Get up, we're late. - Leave me alone. - Get up. Good morning, Yesmin. Glad you found your way here today. We'll start with today's theme. We'll be looking at two things in today's lesson... Writing concrete texts. Writing concrete texts. We write concrete texts in the exam on specific topics. What are we doing? What are nouns in fact? Can you think of concrete or abstract terms? - Concrete, for example, is... - The sky is blue. Can I grasp the sky? - Oh, I see. - No, I can't. Everything ok? - Yes. - Really? - Yes. - Yes? Why do you ask? Everything that I can take hold of is concrete. And then we went down into the cellar with our books. There was a bunker, or cellar, at our house. And we started to sleep there at night, because we were afraid to sleep upstairs. Then we went down with our books, and with what were our CD players. Back then in Iraq there were only cassettes. Then I and your uncle stayed in the cellar for eight years. Eight years. With our books, with our friends. Friends visted too. We lived normally. Back then I thought it was normal, that everyone lives like that. But... if you think how times are now. You never forget that. You know, whenever you see anything on TV... If you see people and children... You sometimes think... ...when they say, I don't know, 500 people come here who don't deserve to and live here at our expense but... ...but if you save one life at least... Don't be sad. It comes back, that's the thing, it always comes back when you see images of people fleeing. I see their eyes. Again and again. As they lie there dead. As they say, "Help me". Today is truly a shitty day. If you grab my face again, I'll bite you. - Nothing happened. - Nothing happened. Empty threats. Are you mad? - Can you feel it when I do that? - No. - Like it was her body... - No sensation. Like this. I think she's larging it up there. Probably going to clubs with boys. - I think that she... - Nati. You're so retarded - You know her! - It's Iraq. She's found a cool Airbnb cos she met someone. - There aren't any Airbnbs, it's Iraq. - Right, it's nothing but minefields. Exactly. You make out you're so cool, but try... - We saw the news. - Try being there as a woman. Thought about that? - You been there? - No. - So what are you talking about? - I inform myself. Then you'd know there can be a different reality. Another reality? It's not like you imagine it. The war's not everywhere. There are also people having fun there. - Going out for a latte. - Yeah. You just have to think of it like Vienna... Why are you here if it's so cool there? I was born here. - She doesn't know anyone there. - Your parents? It didn't use to be so great there. But my parents aren't from Erbil, they're from a village in Iraq. What do you think she's doing? I don't know. I think she was just curious. Maybe they wanted to worry us a bit, like "Hey, what's it like when we're gone. Worry about us?" - That'd be so Bella. - Yeah, true. Let's go to Iraq and see what happens. Spotlight on. Look in my eyes. More is more. That's true. - Dr Anna. - Good for getting to sleep. That didn't work either. Ok, I'm a plank, peeps. - Why? - Doesn't work. The filter is cool. You're no good at it. You're making her look like a clown. - Ok, we'll do a clown look. - Instagram-style. So really... I've used an entire lipstick and she looks cool. That's so Instagram. - Give her a clown's nose. - Yeah. Sweet. Like a doll. Let's see. Doll, clown, thermometre. We could... Put some gangsta music on. Put a gangsta on. Careful she doesn't hurt herself. No! You're really lashed, aren't you? Lol. Again. She falls around so easily. She's our nodding dog. Cute nodding dog. - She'll conduct Beethoven today. - For this influencer video. Go "oo-oo aa-aa". With "aa". Oo-oo aa-aa. Again. Gourmet chef. Gourmet chef filter. - I feel ill. - No. Open your eyes. Drink water. Puke like in nursery school. Get smashed and then puke. Yeah, do that. Can you help me, please. I'm covered in sick. You'll just have to shower. - Is it coming off? - Not easily. It's so obvious, honestly. Why did you put that on her? You ok? - You ok? - Yes. God, it looks even worse. Oops, she was on the sun bed too long. Careful. Need to vomit? Yes Awini. Why's she lying like that? Yesmin. Her breathing is stable. She just had alcohol. - Drive to the hospital. Hurry. - Awini... Or stop here and we'll call an ambulance. - How can I stop here? - Stop the car. What is this? - Yesmin! Yesmin! - She's breathing well. Keep your eyes on the road. Yesmin. Sweetheart, what is it? What did you eat? - Her breathing's normal. - It's not. - It is. - No, look at her face. She's dying. Stop somewhere. - Awini, she's breathing ok. - Give me your hand. Her condition is good. Give me your hand. You talk too much, let her rest. Find a place to park. Where's Kerim actually? Why talk about Kerim? It's not the time. She's dying. Kerim is always out. He's wearing us out. - Call Kerim. - Stop it and stop here. What happened, my child? What did you eat? Let her vomit. - Then she'll feel better. - What are you doing? - Yesmin, Yesmin. She's vomiting. - That's normal. Yesmin, Yesmin... SONNE
